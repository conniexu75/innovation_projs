https://openalex.org/W1797925867,"An approach to the systematic identification and quantification of the proteins contained in the microsomal fraction of cells is described. It consists of three steps: (1) preparation of microsomal fractions from cells or tissues representing different states; (2) covalent tagging of the proteins with isotope-coded affinity tag (ICAT) reagents followed by proteolysis of the combined labeled protein samples; and (3) isolation, identification, and quantification of the tagged peptides by multidimensional chromatography, automated tandem mass spectrometry, and computational analysis of the obtained data. The method was used to identify and determine the ratios of abundance of each of 491 proteins contained in the microsomal fractions of naïve and in vitro- differentiated human myeloid leukemia (HL-60) cells. The method and the new software tools to support it are well suited to the large-scale, quantitative analysis of membrane proteins and other classes of proteins that have been refractory to standard proteomics technology."

Here, we extend two-photon imaging from anesthetized, head-stabilized to awake, freely moving animals by using a miniaturized head-mounted microscope. Excitation light is conducted to the microscope in a single-mode optical fiber, and images are scanned using vibrations of the fiber tip. Microscope performance was first characterized in the neocortex of anesthetized rats. We readily obtained images of vasculature filled with fluorescently labeled blood and of layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons filled with a calcium indicator. Capillary blood flow and dendritic calcium transients were measured with high time resolution using line scans. In awake, freely moving rats, stable imaging was possible except during sudden head movements."
https://openalex.org/W2053330127,"Among the most intriguing forms of Ca(2+) channel modulation is the regulation of L-type and P/Q-type channels by intracellular Ca(2+), acting via unconventional channel-calmodulin (CaM) interactions. In particular, overexpressing Ca(2+)-insensitive mutant CaM abolishes Ca(2+)-dependent modulation, hinting that Ca(2+)-free CaM may ""preassociate"" with these channels to enhance detection of local Ca(2+). Despite the far-reaching consequences of this proposal, in vitro experiments testing for preassociation provide conflicting results. Here, we develop a three filter-cube fluorescence resonance energy transfer method (three-cube FRET) to directly probe for constitutive associations between channel subunits and CaM in single living cells. This FRET assay detects Ca(2+)-independent associations between CaM and the pore-forming alpha(1) subunit of L-type, P/Q-type, and, surprisingly, R-type channels. These results now definitively demonstrate channel-CaM preassociation in resting cells and underscore the potential of three-cube FRET for probing protein-protein interactions."

https://openalex.org/W2041335773,"Hormonally stimulated lipolysis occurs by activation of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) which phosphorylates hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) and increases adipocyte lipolysis. Evidence suggests that catecholamines not only can activate PKA, but also the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK). We now demonstrate that two different inhibitors of MEK, the upstream activator of ERK, block catecholamine- and β3-stimulated lipolysis by ∼30%. Furthermore, treatment of adipocytes with dioctanoylglycerol, which activates ERK, increases lipolysis, although MEK inhibitors decrease dioctanoylglycerol-stimulated activation of lipolysis. Using a tamoxifen regulatable Raf system expressed in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes, exposure to tamoxifen causes a 14-fold activation of ERK within 15–30 min and results in ∼2-fold increase in HSL activity. In addition, when differentiated 3T3-L1 cells expressing the regulatable Raf were exposed to tamoxifen, a 2-fold increase in lipolysis is observed. HSL is a substrate of activated ERK and site-directed mutagenesis of putative ERK consensus phosphorylation sites in HSL identified Ser600 as the site phosphorylated by active ERK. When S600A HSL was expressed in 3T3-L1 cells expressing the regulatable Raf, tamoxifen treatment fails to increase its activity. Thus, activation of the ERK pathway appears to be able to regulate adipocyte lipolysis by phosphorylating HSL on Ser600 and increasing the activity of HSL. Hormonally stimulated lipolysis occurs by activation of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) which phosphorylates hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) and increases adipocyte lipolysis.

The flux of free fatty acids is primarily dependent on the lipolysis of stored triacylglycerols in adipose tissue (1Gordon Jr., R.S. Cherkes A. J. Clin. Invest. 1956; 35: 206-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The control of lipolysis is complex and involves multiple mechanisms (2Londos C. Brasaemle D.L. Schultz C.J. Adler-Wailes D.C.

These include lipolytic (β-adrenergic agonists, ACTH, etc.) and anti-lipolytic (insulin, adenosine, etc.) hormones, their cognate receptors and signaling pathways, lipid droplet-associated proteins, such as perilipins (5Greenberg A.S.

Lipolytic stimuli increase lipolysis by activating adenylyl cyclase and raising intracellular concentrations of cyclic AMP, with resultant activation of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) (4Collins S.

The phosphorylation of HSL is associated with an increase in hydrolytic activity of the enzyme (7Fredrikson G. Stralfors P. Nilsson N.O. Belfrage P. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 6311-6320Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the translocation of HSL from the cytosol to the lipid droplet in some physiological settings (11Egan J.J. Greenberg A.S.

PKA has been shown to phosphorylate HSL at residues Ser563, Ser659, and Ser660, all of which reside in a 150-amino acid stretch, termed the regulatory module (14Shen W.-J. Patel S. Natu V. Kraemer F.B. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8973-8979Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 15Anthonsen M.W. Rönnstrandt L. Wernstedt C. Degerman E. Holm C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 215-221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). The regulatory module is found within the C-terminal domain of HSL, which also contains the catalytic triad (16Contreras J.A. Karlsson M. Østerlund T. Laurell H. Svensson A. Holm C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31426-31430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Although it is generally accepted that lipolysis is stimulated by PKA activation, as a consequence of GTP-binding protein (G protein)-coupled receptors acting through adenylyl cyclase and cyclic AMP, there is accumulating evidence to suggest that, in addition to PKA, G protein-coupled receptors and cyclic AMP can also activate mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways (17van Biesen T. Luttrell L.M. Hawes B.E. Lefkowitz R.J. Endocr. Rev. 1996; 17: 698-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 18Vossler M.R. Yao H. York R.D. Pan M.G. Rim C.S. Stork P.J.

Members of the MAPK family enable cells to transduce extracellular signals into an intracellular response (20Chang L. Karin M. Nature. 2001; 410: 37-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (4420) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, three parallel MAPK pathways have been identified which include the extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs), p44 MAPK (ERK1), and p42 MAPK (ERK2), stress-activated protein kinases, also referred to as c-Jun-NH2-terminal kinases (JNK), and the p38 MAPKs. ERKs are activated by growth factors acting via MAPK kinase kinases (such as Raf) and MAPK kinases (MEKs) and are involved in both cell proliferation and differentiation (20Chang L. Karin M. Nature. 2001; 410: 37-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (4420) Google Scholar). Whereas, stress-activated protein kinases/JNKs and p38 MAPK are thought to be activated primarily in response to proinflammatory cytokines and environmental stress (20Chang L. Karin M. Nature. 2001; 410: 37-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (4420) Google Scholar). Of particular interest, recent studies have shown that β-adrenergic agonists are capable of activating ERK in adipocytes (21Shimizu Y. Tanishita T. Minokoshi Y. Shimazu T.

In the current paper, we have addressed whether the MAPK pathway, and specifically ERK, is involved in the regulation of lipolysis. All chemicals were from Sigma unless otherwise indicated. Bovine serum albumin (fraction V) was from Intergen Co., Purchase, NY; fetal bovine serum from Gemini Bio-Products, Inc., Calabasas, CA; Coon's F12/Dulbecco's modified Eagle's media, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's media, and Lipofectin reagent from Life Technologies, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD; ECL Western blotting detection reagents, horseradish peroxidase-linked whole antibody anti-rabbit IgG, cholesteryl [1-14C]oleate fromAmersham Pharmacia Biotech; nitrocellulose paper from Schleicher and Schuell, Keene, NH; Quick-Change Site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene, La Jolla, CA; anti-ACTIVE MAPK and anti-ERK1/2 antibodies from Promega, Madison, WI; anti-phospho-JNK, anti-phospho-p38 MAPK, and anti-total p38 MAPK antibodies from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA; anti-total JNK antibodies from New England BioLabs, Beverly, MA. The MEK inhibitors U1026 (1,4-diamino-2,3-dicyano-1,4-bis[2-aminophenylthio]butadiene) and PD098059 (2′-amino-3′-methoxyflavone) were from Calbiochem, San Diego, CA. Disodium (R,R)-5-(2[[2-(3-chlorophenyl)-2-hydroxyethyl]-amino]propyl]-1,3-benzodioxole-2,2-dicarboxylate (CL316,243) was a kind gift from Wyeth-Ayerst, Philadelphia, PA. Organic solvents were from J. T. Baker (Phillipsburg, NJ). Mutagenesis of putative MAPK recognition sites in HSL was carried out using the Quick-Change Site-directed Mutagensis Kit. To facilitate the selection of positive mutants, an additional, neutral base pair alteration, which either introduced or eliminated a restriction enzyme site, was also incorporated into each set of primers. Primers used for the mutagenesis were: T540A, 5′-CCCCATAAGGCCCCAGTGGCCTGCAAC; S600A, 5′-CCATCAGACGCCCCCGAGATGTCA; T614A, 5′-GGCCCCTCCGCACCCTCGGATGTGAACTTT; S680A, 5′-AAGAACCCCTTTATGGCTCCTCTGCTG. All constructs were sequenced to confirm the desired mutations and to ensure that no additional mutation had been introduced. Chinese hamster ovary cells were grown in Coon's F12/Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C under 5% CO2. 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). ΔRaf:ER cells were generated as described previously (24De Fea K. Roth R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31400-31406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar) by stably expressing pBABE-ΔRaf:ER/puro (a kind gift of Dr. Martin McMahon, DNAX) in 3T3-L1 cells by retroviral infection. 3T3-L1 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% calf serum at 37 °C under 5% CO2. For differentiation into adipocytes, cells were allowed to reach confluence and media changed to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum along with 2 μm insulin, 1 μm dexamethasone, and 0.5 mm isobutylmethylxanthine for 48 h. Fully differentiated adipocytes were used 7–10 days later for study of lipolysis. For transient transfection experiments, cells were subcultured at a density of 2 × 105 cells/well in six-well plates the day prior to incubation with 0.75 μg of pCDNA3-HSL or HSL mutants, and 0.25 μg of pCMV β-galactosidase in 10 μl of Lipofectin reagent. Cells were transfected following the procedure from Life Technologies, Inc. Forty h after transfection, cells were washed and changed to serum-free media. Following serum starvation for 16 h, cells were treated with 1 μmtamoxifen to stimulate the activity of Raf. After 20 min treatment, cells were harvested in TES buffer containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 unit/ml leupeptin, 0.2 mg/ml aprotinin, and 5 mm NaF). Cells were harvested and briefly sonicated in TES buffer with protease and phosphatase inhibitors. Homogenates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min, and the supernatants were taken for electrophoresis. Samples were electrophoresed on 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose, incubated with anti-rat HSL fusion protein IgG (25Kraemer F.B. Patel S. Saedi M.S. Sztalryd C. J. Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 663-671Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), anti-ACTIVE MAPK, and anti-ERK1/2 antibodies, and visualized by chemiluminescence as described previously (26Pritchard C.A. Samuels M.L. Bosch E. McMahon M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6430-6442Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). For studies with MEK inhibitors, differentiated 3T3-L1 cells were preincubated with PD098059 for 3 h or with U1026 for 1 h prior to initiation of measurement of lipolysis. Lipolysis was measured as glycerol content in the incubation media using a colorimetric assay as described (27Sztalryd C. Kraemer F.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: E179-E185Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Souza S.C. de Vargas L.M. Yamamoto M.T. Lien P. Franciosa M.D. Moss L.G. Greenberg A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24665-24669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). HSL activity was determined on supernatants of cell homogenates after centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 15 min, using cholesteryl ester as substrate, as described previously (25Kraemer F.B. Patel S. Saedi M.S. Sztalryd C. J. Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 663-671Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Chinese hamster ovary cells that were transfected with different HSL mutants were grown in Coon's F12/Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum until confluent, and then harvested in lysis buffer (0.15 mNaCl, 3% Triton X-100, 0.1% lauryl Sarcosyl, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 unit/ml leupeptin, 0.2 mg/ml aprotinin, and 5 mm NaF). After a brief sonication, the cells were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. For in vitro phosphorylation, 20 μg of cell lysate was mixed with reaction buffer (25 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 10 mm Mg acetate, 50 μm ATP), 2.0 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and 0.01 μg of activated MAP kinase. The mixture was incubated at 30 °C for 30 min; the reaction was stopped, and the volume was adjusted to 250 μl with phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin. The sample was then incubated with rabbit anti-rat HSL/fusion protein IgG (0.5 μg/ml) and 10 μl of protein A beads overnight at 4 °C. The immune complexes were precipitated and washed three times in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin. The final pellet were redissolved in 0.63 m Tris (pH 6.8) containing 8 m urea, 1% β-mercaptoethanol, 1% SDS, and 13% glycerol, boiled for 5 min, and electrophoresed on 10% SDS-PAGE. Autoradiographs were visualized in a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Data are expressed as the mean ± S.E. Statistical analyses were performed by analysis of variance and comparisons among groups by Tukey or Bonferroni/Dunn using either SYSTAT (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL) or GB-STAT (Dynamics Microsystems, Inc., Silver Springs, MD). To determine whether the ERK pathway contributes to catecholamine-stimulated lipolysis, two specific MEK (MAP kinase kinase) inhibitors PD098059 (29Alessi D.R. Cueda A. Cohen P. Dudley D.T. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27489-27494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3259) Google Scholar) and U0126 (30Favata M.F. Horiuchi K.Y. Manos E.J. Daulerio A.J. Stradley D.A. Feeser W.A. van Dyk D.E. Pitts W.J. Earl R.A. Hobbs F. Copeland R.A. Magolda R.L. Scherle P.A. Trzaskos J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18623-18632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2754) Google Scholar) were used to block activation of the MEK/ERK pathway. PD098059 suppresses MEK activation by binding inactive MEK and preventing its phosphorylation by upstream kinases such as Raf-1, while U0126 binds to MEK and inhibits the catalytic activity of the active enzyme. As shown in Fig.1, incubation of differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes with either PD098059 or U0126 resulted in a decrease in the low levels of glycerol released from cells in the absence of added lipolytic stimuli, suggesting that a portion of basal lipolysis might depend on signals via MAPK. When adipocytes were exposed to isoproterenol, a nonselective β-adrenergic agonist, or to CL316,243, a specific β3-adrenergic agonist, there was an ∼6-fold increase in lipolysis. Co-incubation with PD098059 or U0126 caused a 27 and 32% inhibition of isoproterenol-stimulated lipolysis (p < 0.01), respectively, and a 33 and 41% inhibition of β3-stimulated lipolysis (p < 0.01), respectively. Fig. 1 B shows that isoproterenol and CL316,243 increased ERK activation, as detected by phospho-ERK, and that this activation was prevented by preincubation with either PD098059 or U0126, while the total amount of ERK was unchanged. Thus, based on data using inhibitors, it appears that ∼1/3 of β-adrenergic-stimulated lipolysis could be attributed to activation of the MAPK pathway and ERK. As another approach to assess whether the MAPK pathway is involved in mediating lipolysis, differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes were treated with dioctanoylglycerol, a cell-permeable diacylglycerol that activates protein kinase C (31Davis R.J. Ganong B.R. Bell R.M. Czech M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 1562-1566Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The protein kinase C family consists of at least 11 members that are involved in signal transduction (32Liu J.-P. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1996; 116: 1-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar), mediating a portion of their effects via activation of the MAPK/ERK pathway (33Marais R. Light Y. Mason C. Paterson H. Olson M.F. Marshall C.J. Science. 1998; 280: 109-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar, 34Schonwasser D.C. Marais R.M. Marshall C.J. Parker P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 790-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar). When adipocytes were exposed to dioctanoylglycerol (Fig.2), there was a statistically significant ∼2-fold increase in glycerol release (p < 0.01), although the magnitude of the increase was only ∼30% of that seen with maximal β-adrenergic stimulation. Co-incubation with PD098059 or U0126 caused a 57 and 88% inhibition of dioctanoylglycerol-stimulated lipolysis (p < 0.01), respectively. Fig. 2 Bshows that dioctanoylglycerol increased ERK activation, as detected by phospho-ERK, and that this activation was prevented by preincubation with either PD098059 or U0126, while the total amount of ERK was unchanged. These data are again consistent with the MAPK/ERK pathway participating in the regulation of lipolysis. To study the effects of ERK activation on lipolysis in the absence of confounding effects of other signaling cascades that can be simultaneously activated by hormone treatment, we used a regulatable Raf system in which ERK activation is controlled. Although Raf directly activates MEK and, consequently, ERKs, Raf does not activate any other MAP kinase pathways (35Robinson M.J. Cobb M.H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 180-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (2286) Google Scholar). For this purpose we used 3T3-L1 cells into which a tamoxifen-activable Raf:ER fusion protein (ΔRaf-1:ER) containing the hormone-binding domain of a mutant estrogen receptor that binds tamoxifen, but not estrogen, and the kinase domain of B-Raf was introduced (24De Fea K. Roth R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31400-31406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 36Samuels M.L. Weber M.J. Bishop J.M. McMahon M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6241-6252Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Binding of an estrogen analog to the expressed ΔRaf-1:ER causes a conformational change in the fusion protein, resulting in the activation of Raf-1 and the subsequent rapid activation of ERK1 and ERK2. Fig. 3 shows that there was an 8–14-fold increase in ERK1 and -2 activation, as detected by phospho-ERK, within 20–30 min following exposure of cells to tamoxifen, while the total amount of ERK was unchanged. In contrast, there was no evidence for the activation of either JNK (Fig.3 C) or p38 MAPK (Fig. 3 D), as detected by phospho-JNK and phospho-p38 MAPK, respectively, by tamoxifen, although both JNK and p38 MAPK proteins were detected by immunoblotting. Thus, ERK appears to be the only MAPK pathway regulated by tamoxifen-activable Raf in these cells. The ΔRaf:ER cells were allowed to differentiate into adipocytes, serum starved overnight, and then exposed to 1 μm tamoxifen to examine the effects of ERK activation on lipolysis (Fig. 4). The specific activation of ERK resulted in an ∼2-fold increase in glycerol release (p < 0.01) over 90 min, further demonstrating a role for the MAPK/ERK pathway in regulating lipolysis. In comparison, isoproterenol (10−7m) stimulated glycerol release ∼5-fold in differentiated ΔRaf:ER cells (data not shown).Figure 4Effect of ERK activation on lipolysis in ΔRaf:ER cells. ΔRaf:ER cells were allowed to differentiate into adipocytes, serum starved overnight, and then exposed to 1 μm tamoxifen. Glycerol content in the media was determined at the indicated times. Results are the mean ± S.E. of sextuplicate measurements and are representative of four independent experiments. *, p < 0.01 compared with no tamoxifen.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To explore the mechanism whereby MAPK/ERK activation leads to an increase in lipolysis, ΔRaf:ER preadipocytes were transfected with normal rat HSL cDNA. Forty-eight h after transfection, the cells were washed, treated with 1 μm tamoxifen for 20 min, and cell extracts assayed for HSL activity. As shown in Fig.5, activation of ERK by exposure to tamoxifen increased HSL activity, as measured as neutral cholesteryl ester hydrolase, ∼2-fold (p < 0.01). Thus, ERK activation appears to result in the rapid stimulation of HSL activity, which is followed by a parallel increase in lipolysis. HSL activity is known to be regulated by phosphorylation (3Holm C. Osterlund T. Laurell H. Contreras J.A. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2000; 20: 365-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). PKA increases HSL activity via phosphorylation at Ser563, Ser659, and Ser660 (14Shen W.-J. Patel S. Natu V. Kraemer F.B. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8973-8979Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar,15Anthonsen M.W. Rönnstrandt L. Wernstedt C. Degerman E. Holm C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 215-221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar), although phosphorylation at Ser565 by glycogen synthase kinase, AMP-dependent protein kinase, or Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II has been reported to prevent activation of the enzyme (37Garton A.J. Yeaman S.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 191: 245-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Computer analysis of the sequence of HSL revealed four putative MAPK phosphorylation sites (Thr540, Ser600, Thr614, and Ser680) located within the regulatory module of the protein. To examine whether any of these sites is recognized and phosphorylated by activated MAPK/ERK, we performed site-directed mutagenesis on each of the putative phosphorylation sites, converting each to Ala. After sequencing to confirm the identity of the clones, Chinese hamster ovary cells were transiently transfected with the mutants or wild-type HSL. Cellular extracts were then incubated with [32P]ATP and activated MAPK/ERK in vitro and HSL immunoprecipitated. As shown in Fig.6, HSL is a substrate for activated MAPK/ERK since wild-type HSL was phosphorylated. Mutation of T540A, T614A, and S680A had no effects on the ability of HSL to be phosphorylated by activated MAPK/ERK, when corrected for the amount of HSL expressed. In contrast, S600A completely eliminated the phosphorylation of HSL by activated MAPK/ERK, suggesting that Ser600 is the target of MAPK/ERK. To directly determine whether the phosphorylation of HSL at Ser600 is required for activation of HSL activity by MAPK/ERK, ΔRaf:ER preadipocytes were transfected with mutant or wild-type HSL cDNA. Forty-eight h after transfection, the cells were washed, treated with 1 μm tamoxifen for 20 min, and cell extracts assayed for HSL activity (Fig.7 A). As seen previously, activation of ERK by exposure to tamoxifen increased neutral cholesteryl ester hydrolase activity ∼2-fold (p < 0.01) in cells transfected with wild-type HSL. Basal (no tamoxifen treatment) HSL activity was not appreciably affected by mutation of T540A, T614A, or S680A, and, consonant with the phosphorylation of these mutants by activated MAPK/ERK, exposure to tamoxifen increased neutral cholesteryl ester hydrolase activity. However, the tamoxifen-induced increases in HSL hydrolytic activity of the T540A and T614A mutants, although statistically significant, were not as robust as seen with wild-type HSL. The tamoxifen-induced increase in the hydrolytic activity of the S680A mutant was indistinguishable from wild-type HSL. Mutation of S600A also had no appreciable effect on basal HSL activity, but eliminated the ability of ERK activation to increase neutral cholesteryl ester hydrolase activity, demonstrating that phosphorylation of Ser600 by activated MAPK/ERK is required for stimulating HSL hydrolytic activity. Equivalent amounts of wild type and mutant HSL were expressed in the transfected cells as documented by immunoblot with anti-HSL antibodies (Fig.7 B). The MAPK family consists of several kinase cascades that respond to mitogens, cytokines, and environmental stress, leading to changes in gene expression, metabolism, and cellular regulatory events that mediate cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival, and inflammatory and stress responses (20Chang L. Karin M. Nature. 2001; 410: 37-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (4420) Google Scholar, 38Seger R. Krebs E.G. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 726-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (3218) Google Scholar, 39Garrington T.P. Johnson G.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 211-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (1136) Google Scholar). MAPK specificity is controlled by multiple mechanisms, including sequential physical interactions of members within a particular cascade, interactions with docking proteins that act as scaffolds, and spatial localization (20Chang L. Karin M. Nature. 2001; 410: 37-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (4420) Google Scholar). The three-tiered MAPK/ERK pathway has classically been viewed to respond to growth factors, with activation of tyrosine kinase receptors acting through small G-proteins, such as Ras, leading to the activation of the proximal MAPK kinase kinase, Raf (20Chang L. Karin M. Nature. 2001; 410: 37-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (4420) Google Scholar). Raf then phosphorylates and activates the MAPK kinases MEK1 and MEK2, which in turn phosphorylate and activate the MAP kinases ERK1 and ERK2 (20Chang L. Karin M. Nature. 2001; 410: 37-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (4420) Google Scholar). In addition to growth factor receptors, accumulating evidence supports a role for regulation of MAPK by G protein-coupled receptors (17van Biesen T. Luttrell L.M. Hawes B.E. Lefkowitz R.J. Endocr. Rev. 1996; 17: 698-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 19Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1839-1842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar,40Miller W.E. Lefkowitz R.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 139-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). A number of different mechanisms appear to link G protein-coupled receptors with MAPK activation. For instance, subunits of G proteins have been linked to ERK activation via Ras-dependent and independent pathways (41Crespo P. Cachero T.G. Xu N. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25259-25265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 42Wan Y. Huang X.Y. J. Biol.

Lefkowitz R.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 139-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar); and the participation of scaffolding proteins in the binding of receptor- and nonreceptor-tyrosine kinases, as well as members of the MAPK cascade have been suggested (40Miller W.E. Lefkowitz R.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 139-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 43Kaw"
https://openalex.org/W2091334133,"We previously reported that the cell surface proteoglycan syndecan-2 can induce dendritic spine formation in hippocampal neurons. We demonstrate here that the EphB2 receptor tyrosine kinase phosphorylates syndecan-2 and that this phosphorylation event is crucial for syndecan-2 clustering and spine formation. Syndecan-2 is tyrosine phosphorylated and forms a complex with EphB2 in mouse brain. Dominant-negative inhibition of endogenous EphB receptor activities blocks clustering of endogenous syndecan-2 and normal spine formation in cultured hippocampal neurons. This is the first evidence that Eph receptors play a physiological role in dendritic spine morphogenesis. Our observations suggest that spine morphogenesis is triggered by the activation of Eph receptors, which causes tyrosine phosphorylation of target molecules, such as syndecan-2, in presumptive spines."

They consist of a group of four serologically related viruses referred to as dengue virus types 1–4, with infection resulting in a range of clinical diseases such as dengue fever, dengue hemorrhagic fever, and dengue shock syndrome (1Jacobs M.G. Young P.R. Curr. Opin. Infect. Dis. 1998; 11: 319-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). There is currently no approved vaccine or effective antiviral therapy for these diseases. Like other flaviviruses, the dengue viruses are enveloped with a single, positive sense 11-kilobase RNA genome encoding one long open reading frame. Gene expression involves both co- and post-translational proteolytic processing of a large polyprotein precursor into three structural proteins (C, prM, and E) and seven nonstructural proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5) (Fig. 1 A) (2Chambers T.J. Hahn C.S. Galler R. Rice C.M. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1990; 44: 649-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (1564) Google Scholar). In addition to host proteases, a single virus-encoded protease comprising the amino-terminal 180 amino acids of NS3 (NS3pro) is responsible for cleavage both in cis and in trans to generate viral proteins that are essential for viral replication and maturation of infectious dengue virions (3Falgout B. Pethel M. Zhang Y.M. Lai C.J. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 2467-2475Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). NS3 is at least a trifunctional protein because the carboxyl-terminal region encodes both nucleoside triphosphatase and helicase activities (4Wengler G. Wengler G. Virology. 1991; 184: 707-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 5Li H.T. Clum S. You S.H. Ebner K.E. Padmanabhan R. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 3108-3116Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The dengue virus NS3 protease shares with other flavivirus NS3 proteases a trypsin-like character with a classic serine protease catalytic triad (His51, Asp75, and Ser135) (6Bazan J.F. Fletterick R.J. Virology. 1989; 171: 637-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 7Bazan J.F. Fletterick R.J. Semin. Virol. 1990; 1: 311-322Google Scholar, 8Gorbalenya A.E. Donchenko A.P. Koonin E.V. Blinov V.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 3889-3897Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Although unlike trypsin it has a marked preference for dibasic residues (e.g. Arg and Lys at P1 and P2) and requires the co-factor activity supplied by the nonstructural protein NS2B for efficient catalysis of the proteolytic cleavage of the dengue virus polyprotein (3Falgout B. Pethel M. Zhang Y.M. Lai C.J. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 2467-2475Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The NS2B-NS3 conjugate has been shown to cleave the precursor polyprotein at the NS2A/NS2B, NS2B/NS3, NS3/NS4A, and NS4B/NS5 junctions as well as at internal sites within C, NS2A, NS3, and NS4A (9Chambers T.J.

Virol. 1997; 71: 8475-8481Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Deletion studies employing vaccinia recombinants have further shown that a central 40-amino acid conserved hydrophilic domain within NS2B is sufficient for co-factor activity (16Falgout B. Miller R.H. Lai C.J. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 2034-2042Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The flanking hydrophobic residues of NS2B are likely to function by promoting association between the protease complex and infected cell membranes (17Clum S. Ebner K.E. Padmanabhan R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30715-30723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The essential nature of the central hydrophilic domain for proteolytic activity has been recently confirmed in vitrowith Escherichia coli expressed and purified recombinant NS3pro complexed with this NS2B co-factor domain (18Yusof R.

To mount a similar antiviral program for the dengue viruses, we describe in this paper the expression and purification of two recombinant forms of NS3 protease and the preliminary characterization of the enzymology, including limitations imposed by assay conditions, substrates, and co-factors. We also describe the activity of the first substrate-based peptide inhibitors. Protected amino acids and resins were obtained from Novabiochem. TFA, piperidine, DIPEA, and DMF (peptide synthesis grade) were purchased from Auspep. All other materials were reagent grade unless otherwise stated. Crude peptides were purified by reversed-phase HPLC separations performed on a Waters Delta-Pak reversed-phase C18 preparative column, using a gradient mixture of solvent A (0.1% TFA with water) and solvent B (0.1% TFA, 10% water, and 90% acetonitrile. Analytical HPLC was performed on a Waters system equipped with a 717 plus autosampler, 660 controller, and a 996 photodiode array detector using a reversed-phase C18 (Vydac 201HS5415) column or a reversed-phase protein and peptide column (Vydac 218TP5415). Purified peptides were characterized by analytical HPLC (linear gradient 0–100% solvent B over 30 min) and mass spectrometry. The molecular mass of the peptides was determined by electrospray mass spectrometry recorded on a triple quadrupole (PE SCIEX API III) and electrospray TOF (Applied Biosystems Mariner) mass spectrometers. 1H NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian 300MHz or a Bruker 500MHz NMR spectrometer at 303 K. Proton assignments were determined by two-dimensional NMR experiments (double-quantum filtered correlation spectroscopy, total correlation spectroscopy, and nuclear Overhauser enhancement spectroscopy). Generation of NS2B.NS3pro PCR product for cloning. C6/36 cells were infected with dengue 2 virus strain NGC at a multiplicity of infection of 1.0 and incubated at 32 °C for 3 days. Infected cell RNA was then extracted with RNazol B (Tel-Test Inc) according to the manufacturer's instructions. cDNA was generated using the NS3proRXhoI reverse primer (5′-TATACTCGAGCTATCGAAAAATGTCATCTT-3′; restriction sites are underlined), which was then used as template in a PCR reaction employing this primer and NS2BFNcoI (5′-CAAACCATGGCAAGCTGGCCGCTAAATGA-3′). The resulting PCR product comprised the full NS2B sequence and the first 184 amino acids of NS3 (NS3pro) flanked by NcoI-XhoI sites for cloning into pTM1. Four vectors were generated for eukaryotic in vitrotranslation analyses: pTM.NS2B.NS3pro (full-length NS2B.NS3pro), pTM.NS3pro (NS3pro alone), pTM.CF40.NS3pro (NS3pro fused to the 40 amino acid co-factor domain of NS2B), and pTM.CF40.NS3pro−(containing a mutation in one of the amino acids comprising the NS3pro catalytic triad Ser135 to Ala135) (Fig.1 B). The NS2B.NS3pro PCR product described above was digested with NcoI and XhoI and cloned into the pTM1 vector to generate pTM.NS2B.NS3pro. The primers NS3proFNcoI (5′-CAAACCATGGCTGGAGTATTGTGGGATGT-3′) and NS3proRXhoI were used in a PCR reaction with pTM.NS2B.NS3pro as template. The PCR products were digested with NcoI andXhoI and cloned into the pTM1 vector to generate pTM.NS3pro. pTM.CF40.NS3pro was generated by amplification of the ligation products of separate PCR reactions. The two PCR products were amplified off the pTM.NS2B.NS3pro template with the primer pairs, CF40FNcoI (5′-AGGTACCATGGCCGATTTGGAACTG-3′)/CF40RKpnI (5′-GGGGTACCACAGTGTTTGTTCTTCCTC-3′) and NS3proFKpnI (5′-GGGGTACCTGTGGGAAGTGAAGAAACAACGGGCTGGAGTATTGT-3′)/NS3proRXhoI. Both PCR products were digested with KpnI, gel-purified, and then ligated. The products of the ligation were then amplified with the outside primers CF40FNcoI and NS3proRXhoI. The resulting PCR product, comprising the 40-amino acid co-factor domain of NS2B fused to the 10 amino acids immediately upstream of the NS2B-NS3 cleavage site and the first 184 amino acids of NS3pro, was digested with NcoI and XhoI and cloned into the pTM1 vector. pTM.CF40.NS3pro− was generated by PCR mutagenesis using pTM.CF40.NS3pro as template and the complementary mutation primers NS3proFS135A (5′-TCTCCTGGAACCGCAGGATCTCCAATC-3′) and NS3proRS135A (5′-GATTGGAGATCCTGCGGTTCCAGGAGA-3′) in separate PCR reactions with NS3proRXhoI and CF40FncoI, respectively. The nucleotide change leading to the S135A mutation is bold type. Three vectors were generated for the expression in E. coli of amino-terminal His-tagged recombinant dengue viral NS3 protease: pQE9.NS3pro, pQE9.CF40.NS3pro, and pQE9.CF40.gly.NS3pro (CF40 fused to NS3pro via a Gly4SerGly4 linker). pTM.CF40.NS3pro was used as template for the generation of PCR products with the primer pairs NS3proFBamHI (5′-ATTAGGATCCCTGGAGTATTGTGGGATGT-3′)/NS3proRHindIII (5′-GCTAAAGCTTCTATCGAAAAATGTCATCTT-3′) and CF40FBamHI (5′-ATTAGGATCCGCCGATTTAGAACTG-3′)/NS3proRHindIII. PCR products were digested with BamHI and HindIII and cloned into pQE9 to generate pQE9.NS3pro and pQE9. CF40.NS3pro, respectively. pQE9.CF40.gly.NS3pro was generated by overlap PCR using pQE9.CF40.NS3pro as template and the primer pairs CF40FBamHI/CF40glyR (5′-CCCGCCTCCACCACTACCTCCGCCCCCCAGTGTTTGTTCTTCCTC-3′) and NS3proglyF (5′-GGGGGCGGAGGTAGTGGTGGAGGCGGGGCTGGAGTATTGTGGGATG-3′)/ NS3proRHindIII to amplify first round PCR products. These were mixed in limiting concentration and then amplified with the outside primers CF40FBamHI and NS3proRHindIII. The resulting PCR product, comprising the 40-amino acid NS2B co-factor domain fused to NS3pro via a flexible Gly4SerGly4 linker, was digested with BamHI and HindIII and cloned into pQE9. All constructs were confirmed by automated sequence analysis. The pQE9 vector was used for high level, inducible expression of amino-terminal hexahistidine-tagged recombinant proteins. Cultures ofE. coli strain SG13009, transformed with the corresponding expression plasmids, were grown in 2 liters of LB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 25 μg/ml kanamycin at 37 °C until theA 600 nm reached 0.6. The cells were induced for expression by the addition of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranose to a final concentration of 1 mm and incubated for an additional 3 h at 30 °C. The cells were then harvested by centrifugation, and the pellets were stored at −80 °C until used. For protein purification, the cells were thawed and resuspended in 1 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol)/10 ml of original culture. The resuspended cells were lysed by French press or subjected to probe sonication (five 30-s pulses) on ice and then centrifuged at 27,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was stored at 4 °C or purified immediately by passage through a 2-ml column of Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) pre-equilibrated with 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, containing 300 mm NaCl. The column was extensively washed with buffer containing 20 mm imidazole, and protein was then eluted from the column in buffer containing 100 mmimidazole. Elution fractions were analyzed by 15% SDS-PAGE. Samples of pre- and post-induced cells as well as soluble and insoluble fractions following lysis were collected and also analyzed by 15% SDS-PAGE. An in vitro rabbit reticulocyte-coupled transcription/translation system (TnT, Promega) was used to express recombinant protein from the pTM1 vector constructs. The reactions were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, [35S]methionine-labeled protein was expressed by incubation of 0.5 μg of vector DNA with reticulocyte lysate, amino acid (minus methionine) mixture, RNasin, T7 RNA polymerase, and 10.0 μCi of [35S]methionine in a final volume of 25 μl at 30 °C for 90 min. Reactions requiring membranes included 3 μl of canine pancreatic microsomal membranes. The reactions were terminated by the addition of SDS containing gel buffer, and the products were examined by 15% SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. para-Nitroanilide (pNA) substrates were synthesized by solid phase synthesis (24Abbenante, G., Leung, D., Bond, T., and Fairlie, D. P. (2001)Lett. Pept. Sci., in pressGoogle Scholar) using Fmoc protecting groups for the following amino acids: Arg (pmc), Glu (OtBu), Gln (trt), Lys (boc), Ser (tBu), and Thr (tBu). The Fmoc protecting group was removed by shaking the resin with two 1-min treatments with 50% piperidine in dimethylformamide. All amino acids (4 meq) were activated by HBTU (4 meq) and DIPEA (5 meq) in DMF. Couplings were monitored by the quantitative ninhydrin test. All peptides were acetylated with acetic anhydride (20 meq) and DIPEA (10 meq) after the final Fmoc deprotection. Peptide p-aminoanilides were assembled on modified chloride trityl resin (substitution value = 0.96 mmol/g) and subsequently cleaved from the solid support with 95% TFA, 2.5% triisopropylsilane, and 2.5% water (15 ml/g resin) for 1 h at room temperature. The respective p-aminoanilides were oxidized with oxone (6 meq) in water. Crude peptides were purified by reverse-phase HPLC and lyophilized overnight to give purep-nitroanilides in good yield (50–80%). The 10-residue peptide substrate was assembled on Nα-Boc-leucine 4-hydroxymethylphenylacetic acid resin (substitution value = 0.79 mmol/g) (Novabiochem). Protecting groups for individual amino acids were: Arg (Tos), Glu (CHx), and Lys (2-Cl-Z). Removal of the Boc protecting group was effected by shaking the resin twice with 1-min treatments with TFA. All amino acids (4 meq) were activated by HBTU (4 meq) and DIPEA (5 meq) in DMF. Couplings were monitored by the quantitative ninhydrin test. The peptide was deprotected and cleaved from the solid support with liquid HF, p-cresol at −5 °C for 1–2 h. Crude peptide was purified by reverse-phase HPLC and lyophilized overnight (30%). Stock solutions of peptides were prepared in water and kept at −80 °C until use. Peptide substrates were Ac-RTSKKR-pNA, Ac-EVKKQR-pNA, Ac-FAAGRK-pNA, Ac-TTSTRR-pNA, and Ac-EVKKQRAGVL-OH corresponding to pNA analogues of the 2A/2B, 2B/3, 3/4A, and 4B/5 cleavage sites and a 10-amino acid segment derived from the 2B/3 site, respectively. Ac-RTSKKR-pNA, retention time (R t) = 13.5 min, ESMS [M+H]+ = 907.6, [M+2H]2+ = 454.3; Ac-EVKKQR-pNA, R t = 15.3 min, ESMS [M+H]+ = 949.7, [M+2H]2+ = 475.3; Ac-FAAGRK-pNA, R t = 16.7 min, ESMS [M+H]+ = 781.5, [M+2H]2+ = 391.3; Ac-TTSTRR-pNA, R t = 17.7 min, ESMS [M+H]+ = 883.6, [M+2H]2+ = 442.3; and Ac-EVKKQRAGVL-OH, R t = 15.5 min, ESMS [M+H]+ = 1169.4, [M+2H]2+ = 585.5. A spectrophotometric assay was conducted, using peptide substrates appended to a pNA chromophore, in 96-well plates with each well containing a final volume of 200 μl, an enzyme concentration of 0.5 or 1 μm, and an incubation temperature of 37 °C. Each reaction was monitored continuously by following the increase inA 405 on a SpectraMax 250 reader. Initial velocities and substrate concentrations were fitted by nonlinear regression to the Michaelis-Menten equation. pH dependence experiments were carried out with the following buffers: MES (pH 5.5–7.0), MOPS (pH 6.5–8.0), Tris (pH 7.5–9.0), ethanolamine (pH 8.5–10.0), and CAPS (pH 10.0–11.5) together with an enzyme concentration of 1 μm, para-nitroanilide substrates at 500 μm, and a constant ionic strength (50 mm). For overlapping pH regions, the activity was shown to be unaffected by buffer composition. Buffers included NaCl, glycerol, and detergents varied to optimize assay conditions (see “Results”). Subsequent assays with pNA substrates were performed under optimal conditions that involved 50 mm Tris, pH 9.0, 10 mm NaCl, 20% glycerol, 1 mm CHAPS for a final volume of 200 μl in 96-well plate format and 30 μl for HPLC analysis. Cleavage of the 10-residue peptide substrate was determined by analytical HPLC using a Waters system equipped with a 717 plus autosampler, 660 controller, and a 996 photodiode array detector. The enzyme concentration was 1 μm, the incubation temperature was 37 °C, the incubation time was 2 h (<10% substrate conversion), and the reaction was quenched by addition of 70 μl of 0.1% TFA. Samples of 22.5–90 μl were injected on a Vydac reversed-phase column, and fragments were separated using a 0–100% solvent B gradient at 5%/min. Peak detection was facilitated by monitoringA 214 and quantified by integration of chromatograms with respect to the appropriate standard peptide. Initial velocities (v) were determined, and kinetic parameters were calculated from weighted nonlinear regression of initial velocities as a function of eight substrate concentrations [S] using GraphPad Prism® software.k cat/K m values were calculated assuming Michaelis-Menten kinetics, v =V max[S]/([S] + K m). Quadruplicate measurements were taken for each data point. The data are reported as the means ± S.E. General protease inhibitors were used to confirm the presence of a serine protease. Inhibitors were assayed in a 96-well plate format using 50 mm Tris, pH 9.0, 10 mm NaCl, 20% glycerol, 1 mm CHAPS in a final volume of 200 μl. Typically CF40.NS3pro (0.5 μm) was preincubated with various concentrations of test compounds at 37 °C for 10 min. The reaction was initiated by the addition of substrate Ac-TTSTRR-pNA at 500 μm. On the other hand the peptidic inhibitors were assayed using CF40.gly.NS3pro (0.5 μm) in a 96-well plate format using 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 20% glycerol, 1 mm CHAPS in a final volume of 200 μl. Typically these test compounds were incubated with the enzyme conjugate at 37 °C for 50 min, and then substrate cleavage was initiated by the addition of the chromogenic substrate Ac-TTSTRR-pNA at 500 μm. Reaction progress was monitored continuously by following the increase in A 405 on a SpectraMax 250 plate reader. IC50 values were determined for inhibitors from substrate titration experiments performed in the presence of increasing inhibitor concentration using Dixon plots (1/v versus [I]). K i values were calculated from IC50 values according to the equation,K i = IC50/(1 + S/K m). Triplicate measurements were taken for each data point. The data are reported as the means ± S.E. Inhibitors 1(Ac-FAAGRR-{COCONH}-SL-CONH2), 2(Ac-TTSTRR-{COCONH}-SL-CONH2), and 3(Ac-TTSTRR-{COCONH}-GTGN-CONH2) were synthesized on 4-methylbenzhydrylamine resin (substitution value = 0.59mmol/g). The peptides were assembled by stepwise solid phase synthesis using the Boc protocol. Protecting groups for individual amino acids were: Arg (Tos), Ser (Bzl), and Thr (Bzl). Removal of the Boc protecting group was effected by shaking the resin twice with 1-min treatments with TFA. All amino acids (4 meq) were activated by HBTU (4 meq) and DIPEA (5 meq) in DMF with the exception of Boc-Arg(Tos)-α-hydroxy acid (2 meq), which was activated with PyBOP (2 meq) and DIPEA (3 meq) in DMF. Couplings were monitored by the quantitative ninhydrin test. All peptides were acetylated using activated acetic acid with HBTU/DIPEA in DMF after the final Boc deprotection. The α-hydroxyl moiety was oxidized on resin with Dess Martin Periodinane (2 meq) in dry Me2SO for 2 h at room temperature to give the desired α-keto amides. The inhibitors were deprotected and cleaved from the solid support with liquid HF, p-cresol at −5 °C for 1–2 h, during which time partial racemization occurs at P1 arginine, producing a mixture of two diastereoisomers. These α-keto amides are also unstable in basic solutions. Crude peptides were purified by reversed-phase HPLC and characterized by analytical HPLC and electrospray mass spectrometry. Analytical HPLC (gradient, 0–100% solvent B over 30 min): 1,R t = 16.1 min, ESMS [M+H]+ = 946.8, [M+2H]2+ = 473.9; 2, R t = 14.1 min, ESMS [M+H]+ = 990.8, [M+2H]2+ = 495.9; 3, R t = 12.2 min, ESMS [M+H]+ = 1119.6, [M+2H]2+ = 560.3. Boc-Arg(Tos)-OH was activated with BOP/DIPEA in DCM and reacted withN-methyl-O-methylhydroxylamine hydrochloride to give the Weinreb amide in a yield of 81%. The amide was reduced with LiAlH4 in THF at 0 °C, giving the aldehyde in good yield (99%). The aldehyde was treated with KCN to generate the cyanohydrin, which was partially purified by passage through a short column of silica and treated directly with concentrated HCl at room temperature for 3 days. Subsequent neutralization to pH 6 gave the unprotected α-hydroxy acid as colorless crystals (53%). The α-hydroxy acid could be protected at the amino terminus as the Boc or Fmoc derivative by using either Boc-carbonate or Fmoc-OSu in basic solution under standard conditions (66%). Boc-Arg(Tos)-COOH (10.0 g, 23.4 mmol) and N-methyl-O-methyl-hydroxylamine hydrochloride (2.27 g, 23.4 mmol) were dissolved in DCM (50 ml). BOP (10.3 g, 23.4 mmol) and DIPEA (12.2 ml, 70.2 mmol) were added to the stirred mixture and allowed to react for 45 min at room temperature. To this solution was added 10% KHSO4 solution (20 ml), and the mixture was extracted with DCM (3 × 50 ml). The organic layers were combined and washed with 10% KHSO4 (2 × 50 ml), saturated NaHCO3 (3 × 50 ml), water (3 × 50 ml), and brine (3 × 50 ml). The organic layer was dried with MgSO4 and concentrated in vacuo to yield product as an oil, which was triturated with a small volume of ethyl acetate (20 ml) to give a white powder. The powder was filtered and dried (9.0 g, 81%).

Boc-Arg(Tos)-NMeOMe (15.0 g, 31.8 mmol) was dissolved in anhydrous THF (200 ml) and stirred under argon at 0 °C. LiAlH4 (2.0 g, 31.8 mmol) was added in small portions and stirred for 1 h at 0 °C. The reaction mixture was poured into 10% KHSO4 solution (100 ml) and extracted with EtOAc (3 × 100 ml). The organic layers were combined and washed with 10% KHSO4 (3 × 100 ml), water (3 × 100 ml), and brine (3 × 100 ml). The EtOAc layer was dried with MgSO4 and concentrated in vacuo to yield product as white powder (13.0 g, 99%). The aldehyde was not purified further but used directly in subsequent transformations. ESMS [M+H]+ = 413.2; 1H NMR (CDCl3) δ 7.74 (d, 2H, Ar-H), 7.25 (d, 2H, Ar-H), 6.79 (br.s, 1H, NH), 5.66 (s, 1H, aminol-CH), 5.23 (br.s, 1H, NH), 5.05 (d, 1H, Boc-NH), 3.5–3.75 (br.m, 2H, αCH, and δCH), 3.14 (m, 1H, δCH) 2.40 (s, 3H, Ar-CH3), 1.45–1.80 (m, 4H, βCH2, and γCH2), 1.41 (s, 9H, Boc). Boc-Arg(Tos)-CHO (13.0 g, 31.4 mmol) was dissolved in EtOAc (65 ml). KCN (3.54 g) was dissolved in 1:1 mixture of methanol and water (70 ml) and added to the aldehyde. The homogenous reaction mixture was stirred overnight. The mixture was diluted with water (50 ml), and the organic layer was washed with water (3 × 100 ml). The EtOAc layer was dried with MgSO4and concentrated in vacuo to an orange oil that was passed through a short column of silica (30% EtOAc/hexane eluant) to remove base-line material. The resultant oil hydrolyzed with concentrated HCl (60 ml) at room temperature for 3 days. The solution was reduced to dryness, redissolved in water (60 ml), and neutralized to pH 6 with 2m NaOH solution. The desired product existed as two diastereoisomers and precipitated as colorless crystals (6.0 g, 53%). ESMS [M+H]+ = 359.2. H-Arg(Tos)-α-hydroxy acid (0.81 g, 2.3 mmol) was dissolved in 1:1 THF/water (10 ml). 2m NaOH solution (2.3 ml, 4.5 mmol) was added, and the reaction was cooled to 0 °C. Boc-carbonate (0.74 g, 3.4 mmol) was added and stirred for 1 h at 0 °C. The reaction was allowed to warm to room temperature and stirred overnight. THF was removedin vacuo, and the residue was diluted with water (10 ml). The basic aqueous layer was extracted with EtOAc (3 × 30 ml). The aqueous layer was subsequently acidified with 10% KHSO4(20 ml) and extracted with EtOAc (3 × 30 ml). The organic layer was washed with water (3 × 50 ml), dried with MgSO4, and concentrated in vacuo to yield product as a white solid (0.68 g, 66%). ESMS [M+H]+ = 459.3. 1H NMR (CDCl3) (The two diastereomeric products had coincident NMR spectra; only the two Boc signals at δ 1.40, 1.43 were resolved) δ 7.5 (m, 4H, Ar-H), 7.22 (m, 4H, Ar-H), 6.35 (m, 4H, εNH + ωNH), 5.20 (m, 2H, BocNH), 4.67 (m, 2H, CH), 4.00 (m, 2H, αCH), 3.18 (m, 4H, δCH2), 2.38 (s, 6H, CH3), 2.27 (m, 6H, OH + COOH + NH), 1.54 (m, 8H, βCH2 + γCH2), 1.43 (s, 9H, Boc), 1.40 (s, 9H, Boc).

A murine fibroblast-like cell line generated from the kidneys of mice that lack Mdr1a/b and Mrp1 was retrovirally transduced with MRP3 cDNA. Stable clones overproducing MRP3 were resistant to the epipodophyllotoxins etoposide and teniposide but not to vincristine, doxorubicin, and cisplatin, drugs suggested to be MRP3 substrates by others. The resistance to etoposide was associated with reduced cellular accumulation and enhanced efflux of this drug and was not affected by depleting cells of glutathione but was inhibited by several common organic anion transport inhibitors. Membrane vesicles from infected insect cells expressing MRP3 mediated ATP-dependent transport of estradiol 17-β-d-glucuronide, leukotriene C4, dinitrophenyl S-glutathione but not glutathione itself, and etoposide glucuronide, a major metabolite of etoposide in vivo. The transport of estradiol 17-β-d-glucuronide by MRP3 was inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner by both etoposide and methotrexate. Even though etoposide glucuronide is an excellent substrate for MRP3, this compound is not involved in the etoposide resistance of our MRP3 cells, as these cells extrude unmodified etoposide rather than etoposide glucuronide.

The MRP family of membrane transporters consists of 7 members known as MRP1–7 (5Borst P. Evers R. Kool M. Wijnholds J. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2000; 92: 1295-1302Crossref PubMed Scopus (1545) Google Scholar). MRPs function as organic anion transporters and have been shown to extrude a remarkably diverse array of substrates including anticancer drugs (5Borst P. Evers R. Kool M. Wijnholds J. J. Natl.

Mrp1 is the high affinity leukotriene C4 transporter (LTC4) (6Jedlitschky G. Leier I. Buchholz U. Barnouin K. Kurz G. Keppler D. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 988-994PubMed Google Scholar, 11Wijnholds J.

Beijnen J.H. Scheper R.J. Borst P. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 797-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). MRP2 is the major organic anion transporter in the canalicular membrane of hepatocytes (13König J. Nies A.T. Cui Y. Leier I. Keppler D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1461: 377-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar, 14Paulusma C.C. Bosma P.J. Zaman G.J. Bakker C.T. Otter M. Scheffer G.L. Scheper R.J. Borst P. Oude Elferink R.P. Science. 1996; 271: 1126-1128Crossref PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar). The physiological roles of the remaining MRPs have yet to be determined. Among the MRP family members, MRP3 shares the highest amino acid sequence identity (58%) with MRP1 (15Kiuchi Y. Suzuki H. Hirohashi T. Tyson C.A. Sugiyama Y. FEBS Lett. 1998; 433: 149-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar), and both localize to the basolateral membranes of polarized cells (16Kool M. van der Linden M. de Haas M. Scheffer G.L. de Vree J.M. Smith A.J. Jansen G. Peters G.J. Ponne N. Scheper R.J. Elferink R.P. Baas F. Borst P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In humans, MRP3 expression is highest in the adrenal glands and the intra-hepatic bile ducts followed by moderate to low expression in the small intestine, kidney, and pancreas (18Kool M. de Haas M.

MRP3 is highly up-regulated in the livers of rats made cholestatic by bile duct ligation (19Ogawa K. Suzuki H. Hirohashi T. Ishikawa T. Meier P.J. Hirose K. Akizawa T. Yoshioka M. Sugiyama Y. Am. J.

Peters G.J. Ponne N. Scheper R.J. Elferink R.P. Baas F. Borst P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6914-6919Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that MRP3 plays a role in the removal of toxic organic anions from the liver under cholestatic conditions. Support for this notion came from biochemical studies using a vesicular transport system with vesicles enriched for rat Mrp3 (22Hirohashi T. Suzuki H. Sugiyama Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15181-15185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Using this system Hirohashi et al. (22Hirohashi T. Suzuki H. Sugiyama Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15181-15185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar) establish that rat Mrp3 transports several organic anions with a preference toward the glucuronidated ones. A subsequent study by the same group (23Hirohashi T. Suzuki H. Takikawa H. Sugiyama Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2905-2910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar) demonstrated that rat Mrp3 transports the bile salts taurocholate, glycocholate, taurochenodeoxycholate 3-sulfate, and taurolithocholate-3-sulfate, thereby linking MRP3 to a possible role in the entero-hepatic circulation of bile salts. Comparable results were recently obtained with human MRP3, with the exception that no taurocholate transport was detected (24Zeng H. Liu G. Rea P.A. Kruh G.D. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 4779-4784PubMed Google Scholar). Because MRP1 has a broad substrate specificity for anti-cancer drugs, the possible role of MRP3 in drug resistance has been extensively studied. Kool et al. (16Kool M. van der Linden M. de Haas M. Scheffer G.L. de Vree J.M. Smith A.J. Jansen G. Peters G.J. Ponne N. Scheper R.J. Elferink R.P. Baas F. Borst P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Additionally, these cells were highly resistant to short term incubations with high concentrations of methotrexate (MTX), in agreement with the MTX transport found using the vesicular systems (23Hirohashi T. Suzuki H. Takikawa H. Sugiyama Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2905-2910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar,24Zeng H. Liu G. Rea P.A. Kruh G.D. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 4779-4784PubMed Google Scholar). Similar results were obtained by König et al.(17König J. Rost D. Cui Y. Keppler D. Hepatology. 1999; 29: 1156-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar), whereas Zeng et al. (25Zeng H. Bain L.J. Belinsky M.G. Kruh G.D. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 5964-5967PubMed Google Scholar) additionally found low level resistance to vincristine (VCR). This suggests that the substrate specificity of MRP3 might be broader than initially thought. Support for this idea comes from studies by Young et al. (26Young L.C. Campling B.G. Voskoglou-Nomikos T. Cole S.P. Deeley R.G. Gerlach J.H. Clin. Cancer Res. 1999; 5: 673-680PubMed Google Scholar, 27Young L.C. Campling B.G. Cole S.P. Deeley R.G. Gerlach J.H. Clin. Cancer Res. 2001; 7: 1798-1804PubMed Google Scholar). By screening a panel of lung cancer cells lines, they found a strong correlation between MRP3 expression and resistance to doxorubicin and a weaker although significant correlation with resistance to vincristine, etoposide, and cisplatin. An additional unresolved problem is the mechanism by which MRP3 transports drugs that are not negatively charged under physiological conditions, such as etoposide. In the case of MRP1 (28Loe D.W. Deeley R.G. Cole S.P. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 5130-5136PubMed Google Scholar) and MRP2 (29Evers R. de Haas M. Sparidans R. Beijnen J. Wielinga P.R. Lankelma J. Borst P. Br. J. Cancer. 2000; 83: 375-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar) there is now strong evidence that Vinca alkaloids are co-transported with GSH. Transport of some organic substrates is even stimulated by GSH (30Sakamoto H. Hara H. Hirano K. Adachi T. Cancer Lett. 1999; 135: 113-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). MRP1 and -2 are also able to transport GSH by itself, albeit with low affinity. In contrast, MRP3-overproducing cells do not excrete GSH (16Kool M. van der Linden M. de Haas M. Scheffer G.L. de Vree J.M. Smith A.J. Jansen G. Peters G.J. Ponne N. Scheper R.J. Elferink R.P. Baas F. Borst P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6914-6919Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar), and therefore, the role of GSH in MRP3-mediated drug resistance is not yet clear. In this paper we analyze the substrate specificity of MRP3 and its mechanism of drug transport in MRP3-overproducing fibroblasts derived from the kidneys of mice that have a targeted disruption of Mdr1a/b andMrp1 (31Wijnholds J. deLange E.C. Scheffer G.L. van den Berg D.J. Mol C.A. van der Valk M. Schinkel A.H. Scheper R.J. Breimer D.D. Borst P. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 279-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar) and in vesicular transport assays. [3H]Etoposide (411 or 280 mCi/mmol) was purchased from Moravek (Brea, CA). [3H]GSH (50 Ci/mmol), [3H]LTC4 (146 Ci/mmol), and estradiol 17-β-d-glucuronide (E217βG) (44 Ci/mmol) were obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Unlabeled and 3H-labeled 2,4-dinitrophenyl S-glutathione (DNP-SG) were synthesized enzymatically using glycine-2-[3H]GSH (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene and glutathione S-transferase (Sigma) as described previously (32Ishikawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17343-17348Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Unless indicated, all other chemicals and drugs were obtained from Sigma. Solvents used for HPLC analysis were of HPLC grade. Fibroblasts derived from the kidneys of mice that have a homozygous deletion of Mdr1a/b, and Mrp1 cells (31Wijnholds J. deLange E.C. Scheffer G.L. van den Berg D.J. Mol C.A. van der Valk M. Schinkel A.H. Scheper R.J. Breimer D.D. Borst P. J. Clin.

Cells were grown at 37 °C with 5% CO2 under humidifying conditions. Cell lines were regularly checked for the absence of mycoplasma infection. A cDNA insert encoding MRP3 was excised from pGEM7-MRP3 (16Kool M. van der Linden M. de Haas M. Scheffer G.L. de Vree J.M. Smith A.J. Jansen G. Peters G.J. Ponne N. Scheper R.J. Elferink R.P. Baas F. Borst P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6914-6919Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar) using AatII and SphI, blunted, and cloned into the EcoRV site of the retroviral pBabePURO vector (33Morgenstern J.P. Land H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3587-3596Crossref PubMed Scopus (1900) Google Scholar). The resulting pBabePURO-MRP3 vector was transfected into the amphotropic retroviral packaging cell line Phoenix (34Grignani F. Kinsella T. Mencarelli A. Valtieri M. Riganelli D. Lanfrancone L. Peschle C. Nolan G.P. Pelicci P.G. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 14-19PubMed Google Scholar). The virus particles produced were used to transduce fibroblasts derived from the kidneys of mice that lack Mdr1a/b and Mrp1. As control, the same line was transduced with virus particles that contained no MRP3 cDNA insert. After 48 h, the cells were split, and stable clones were selected with 2 μg of puromycin/ml. Resistant clones were analyzed for MRP3 overproduction by immunoblotting. No endogenous murine Mrp3 was detected either in the parental V1 clone or in transfectant MRP3 38 using a rabbit antiserum reacting with mouse Mrp3 but not human MRP3 (not shown). To generate recombinant baculovirus, the MRP3 cDNA was cloned into pBlueBac4.5 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Baculovirus for human MRP3 expression was generated using the Bac-N-Blue expression system (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Total cell lysates were prepared in a hypotonic lysis buffer (10 mmKCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) supplemented by a mixture of protease inhibitors used at the dilution recommended by the manufacturer (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Samples containing varying amounts of protein were separated on a 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Subsequently, gels were blotted overnight in a tank blotting system. MRP3 was detected using the monoclonal antibody M3II-9 (1:250) followed by a rabbit anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase conjugate (1:1000) and visualized with chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Mdr1a/b Pgp and Mrp1 were detected using the monoclonal antibodies C219 and MRP-R1, respectively. For immunolocalization of MRP3, cells were grown overnight on glass slides. MRP3 was detected using M3II-9 (1:50) as the primary antibody and Alexa 488-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG (1:100) as the secondary antibody as described (16Kool M. van der Linden M. de Haas M. Scheffer G.L. de Vree J.M. Smith A.J. Jansen G. Peters G.J. Ponne N. Scheper R.J. Elferink R.P. Baas F. Borst P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6914-6919Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar). The drug sensitivity of cells was determined using growth inhibition assays under continuous long term drug exposure. Cells were plated at a density of 1000 cells/well in triplicate in a 96-well plate. After 24 h, drugs in varying concentrations were added to each well. Incubations were continued for an additional 72 h. For studying the effect of GSH depletion on drug sensitivity cells were incubated for 24 h with 50 μm buthionine sulfoximine (BSO) before the addition of drug. At the end of the assay, the medium was removed from the plates, and the plates were frozen at −80 °C for at least 4 h. Subsequently the plates were thawed, and the total number of cells was determined with fluorescence by using the CyQuant cell proliferation assay kit (Molecular Probes, Leiden, The Netherlands). Fluorescence was measured with a CytoFluor 4000 fluorescence plate reader (Applied Biosystems, Norwalk, CT). The relative resistance was calculated as the ratio of inhibitory concentration IC50 (where 50% of the cells survive) of the resistant cell line to the IC50 of the parental cell line. One day before the assay, cells were plated at a density of 1 × 106/well. The following day, cells were washed twice with pre-warmed phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and incubated with 1 ml of 2 μm [3H]etoposide for 1 h at 37 °C. Subsequently, the cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS, trypsinized, and transferred to a counting vial. Radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation counting in a Packard 1900CA counter (Packard Instrument Co.). The capacity of several general organic anion inhibitors to inhibit the MRP3-mediated accumulation defect was studied by adding them at varying concentrations with the [3H]etoposide to the incubation medium. Cells were plated at a density of 1 × 106/well 1 day before assay. The following day, cells were washed twice with pre-warmed PBS and incubated with 1 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without glucose supplemented with 10% dialyzed fetal calf serum, 10 mm sodium azide, 10 mm 2-deoxyglucose, and 2.5 μm [3H]etoposide for 1 h at 37 °C. After this, the cells were washed twice with cold PBS, and efflux was initiated by the addition of prewarmed complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Samples from the efflux medium were taken at various time points and measured using liquid scintillation counting. To determine intracellular GSH levels, 2 × 106 cells were plated/well. Medium was refreshed 24 h later. When the effect of BSO on intracellular GSH was studied, medium containing 50 μm BSO was used. After an additional 24 h the cells were washed twice with PBS, and intracellular GSH was determined as described (16Kool M. van der Linden M. de Haas M. Scheffer G.L. de Vree J.M. Smith A.J. Jansen G. Peters G.J. Ponne N. Scheper R.J. Elferink R.P. Baas F. Borst P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6914-6919Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar). For studying the efflux of GSH, cells were plated as described above. The following day the cells were washed twice with pre-warmed Hepes-buffered saline solution, pH 7.4 (HBS), and incubated at 37 °C with 1 ml of HBS containing 500 μmacivicin to inhibit γ-glutamyltransferase activity. When the effect of etoposide on GSH efflux was studied, etoposide was included at a concentration of 34 μm. Samples were taken at different time points. After the last sample, the cells were washed twice with ice-cold HBS buffer, and intracellular GSH was determined as above. Synthesis of etoposide glucuronide was as described by others (6Jedlitschky G. Leier I. Buchholz U. Barnouin K. Kurz G. Keppler D. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 988-994PubMed Google Scholar, 30Sakamoto H. Hara H. Hirano K. Adachi T. Cancer Lett. 1999; 135: 113-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) with several minor modifications. In brief, 0.2 mg of rat liver microsome preparations were incubated with 20 mmUDP-glucuronic acid, 10 mm MgCl2, 50 mm MOPS, pH 7.4, and [3H]etoposide (final concentration 100 μm) in a total volume of 200 μl at 37 °C for 2 h. The reaction was terminated by the addition of an equal volume of acetonitrile. After removal of protein, the reaction mix was fractionated by HPLC, and fractions containing [3H]etoposide glucuronide were collected. These fractions were freeze-dried and resuspended in water. The identity of the metabolite was confirmed by mass spectrometry (Sciex, API3000) operating in the negative ion mode. The mass spectrum showed the highest mass fragment at m/z 763.4 ([M-H]−) and ions at m/z 571.0 ([M+H-glucuronic acid]−) with high intensity. Nonlabeled etoposide glucuronide was synthesized in a similar manner with the exception that dog liver microsomes (Gentest, Woburn, MA) were used. The identity of the metabolite was confirmed as above. HPLC analysis of [3H]etoposide and potential metabolites was done as described by Hande et al. (35Hande K. Anthony L. Hamilton R. Bennett R. Sweetman B. Branch R. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 1829-1834PubMed Google Scholar) with minor modifications. In brief, efflux medium was mixed with an equal volume of acetonitrile to precipitate proteins, vortexed for 1 min, and centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 1 min. 50 μl of the resulting supernatant were injected on a 3.9 × 300-mm, μBondapak phenyl column (Waters, Milford, MA). Ultraviolet absorbance (254 nm) was monitored, and a mobile phase of water:acetonitrile:acetic acid (74:25:1) was used to separate etoposide from its potential metabolites. Eluate from the column was collected in 1-ml fractions. Radioactivity in the fractions was measured by liquid scintillation. Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) cells were infected with MRP3-expressing baculovirus at a multiplicity of infection of 1. After incubation at 27 °C for 3 days, cells were harvested by centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 5 min. The pellet was resuspended in ice-cold hypotonic buffer (0.5 mm sodium phosphate, 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4) supplemented with protease inhibitors (2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μm pepstatin) and incubated at 4 °C for 90 min. The suspension was centrifuged at 4 °C at 100,000 ×g for 40 min, and the pellet was homogenized in ice-cold TS buffer (50 mm Tris·HCl, 250 mm sucrose, pH 7.4) using a tight-fitting Dounce homogenizer. After centrifugation at 500 × g at 4 °C for 10 min, the supernatant was centrifuged at 4 °C at 100,000 × g for 40 min. The pellet was resuspended in TS buffer and passed 20 times through a 27-gauge needle. The vesicles were dispensed in aliquots, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C until use. The time- and concentration-dependent uptake of various substrates into MRP3-containing vesicles was studied by the rapid filtration method. Briefly, membrane vesicles containing 20 μg of protein were incubated with the indicated concentrations of substrate in 50 μl of TS buffer in the presence of 4 mm ATP or AMP, 10 mmMgCl2, 10 mm creatine phosphate, and 100 μg of creatine kinase/ml. At the indicated time, the reaction mixture was diluted in 1 ml of ice-cold TS buffer and immediately filtrated through a pure cellulose filter (0.45-μm pore size). The filter was washed twice with 3 ml of ice-cold TS buffer, and the radioactivity retained on the filter was measured by liquid scintillation. To generate stable clones that overproduce MRP3, the MRP3 cDNA was cloned into the retroviral vector pBabePURO. The virus particles that were produced were used to transduce fibroblasts derived from the kidneys of mice that lack Mdr1a/b and Mrp1. Clones that survived selection with 2 μg of puromycin/ml were expanded and analyzed by Western blotting for MRP3 overproduction. Two clones, MRP3 38 and MRP3 77 were used for further study (Fig. 1). In both clones, MRP3 was detected as a double band, presumably resulting from differential glycosylation. We have previously shown in other cells that treatment with tunicamycin, which blocks N-glycosylation, results in the two MRP3 bands shifting to one band which runs with higher mobility (16Kool M. van der Linden M. de Haas M. Scheffer G.L. de Vree J.M. Smith A.J. Jansen G. Peters G.J. Ponne N. Scheper R.J. Elferink R.P. Baas F. Borst P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6914-6919Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar). Levels of MRP3 were stable and showed no decrease for at least 4 months. As expected from the genetic background from which the cell line was generated, expression of Mdr1a/1b or Mrp1 was not detectable (data not shown). As controls, clones were generated from cells transduced with the empty pBabePURO vector, and clone V1 was used as a reference in further experiments. All the clones had similar morphology, size, and cell volume (data not shown). Confocal laser-scanning microscopy was used to determine the subcellular localization of MRP3 in clones MRP3 38 and 77 (Fig.2). Using the monoclonal antibody M3II-9, we detected MRP3 predominantly in the plasma membranes of these clones and in areas of cell-cell contact. However, a portion of MRP3 was found intracellularly, similar to what was found previously with transfectants of the ovarian carcinoma cell line 2008 (16Kool M. van der Linden M. de Haas M. Scheffer G.L. de Vree J.M. Smith A.J. Jansen G. Peters G.J. Ponne N. Scheper R.J. Elferink R.P. Baas F. Borst P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The list of compounds tested is summarized in Table I. High resistance was found only against etoposide and teniposide (Fig.3). To study the effect of GSH depletion on MRP3-mediated etoposide and teniposide resistance, the cells were preincubated with BSO, an inhibitor of GSH biosynthesis, before the addition of drugs. Preincubation of the cells with 50 μmBSO (a nontoxic concentration, data not shown) resulted in a drastic decrease in intracellular GSH levels (Table I). This had no effect on the resistance of MRP3 cells to etoposide or teniposide (Table I).Table IDrug resistance phenotype of MRP3 cellsDrugV1 IC50MRP3 38MRP3 77N1-bNumber of independent experiments.IC50RF1-aRF, relative resistance factor of MRP3 cells calculated as the ratio of MRP3 IC50 to that of V1 IC50.IC50RFnmnmnmEtoposide102 ± 13857 ± 478.4703 ± 1466.918Teniposide28 ± 4128 ± 354.6113 ± 314.19Etoposide/BSO1-cCells were pretreated for 24 h with 50 μm BSO before the addition of drugs.

https://openalex.org/W1993691393,"Spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 (SCA7) is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by a CAG repeat expansion. To determine the mechanism of neurotoxicity, we produced transgenic mice and observed a cone-rod dystrophy. Nuclear inclusions were present, suggesting that the disease pathway involves the nucleus. When yeast two-hybrid assays indicated that cone-rod homeobox protein (CRX) interacts with ataxin-7, we performed further studies to assess this interaction. We found that ataxin-7 and CRX colocalize and coimmunoprecipitate. We observed that polyglutamine-expanded ataxin-7 can dramatically suppress CRX transactivation. In SCA7 transgenic mice, electrophoretic mobility shift assays indicated reduced CRX binding activity, while RT-PCR analysis detected reductions in CRX-regulated genes. Our results suggest that CRX transcription interference accounts for the retinal degeneration in SCA7 and thus may provide an explanation for how cell-type specificity is achieved in this polyglutamine repeat disease."
https://openalex.org/W1992603978,"We identify a chaperone complex composed of (1) the synaptic vesicle cysteine string protein (CSP), thought to function in neurotransmitter release, (2) the ubiquitous heat-shock protein cognate Hsc70, and (3) the SGT protein containing three tandem tetratricopeptide repeats. These three proteins interact with each other to form a stable trimeric complex that is located on the synaptic vesicle surface, and is disrupted in CSP knockout mice. The CSP/SGT/Hsc70 complex functions as an ATP-dependent chaperone that reactivates a denatured substrate. SGT overexpression in cultured neurons inhibits neurotransmitter release, suggesting that the CSP/SGT/Hsc70 complex is important for maintenance of a normal synapse. Taken together, our results identify a novel trimeric complex that functions as a synapse-specific chaperone machine."

The pituitary gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor (GnRHR),1 which mediates the biosynthesis of the gonadotropin luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone, provides a salient example of the exquisite requirements for signaling specificity between the membrane and the genome. The pattern of downstream gene responses depends on the frequency of receptor stimulation. Specific patterns of GnRHR stimulation lead to the generation of distinct transcriptional programs. For example, prolonged GnRH stimulation favors induction of the common α-gonadotropin subunit. In contrast, a specific physiologically relevant frequency range of receptor stimulation on the order of 1 pulse/h preferentially induces the luteinizing hormone beta subunit (LHβ) gene (1Dalkin A.C.

Although downstream signal transduction mediators (such as JNK and ERK) and a number of transcription factors (including Egr1, SF1, and NAB1) have been implicated in modulation of the LHβ promoter (3Tremblay J.J.

The activation of specific secondary genes depends on the pattern of induction of primary genes, which can encode proteins involved in signal feedback and in modulating the transcription of downstream targets. To better understand this process, we have developed a microarray to identify the early gene program induced by GnRHR activation. Microarray techniques have emerged as important approaches for the simultaneous analysis of multiple gene transcripts. These methods have proven valuable in refining cancer classification (7Golub T.R. Slonim D.K. Tamayo P. Huard C. Gaasenbeek M. Mesirov J.P. Coller H. Loh M.L. Downing J.R.

Nature. 2001; 410: 860-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). To overcome the potential limitations of global microarrays, we have integrated microarray technology with a massively parallel candidate gene approach that we refer to as focused microarray analysis (FMA). This approach has been used to develop an early gene microarray for the study of GnRHR responses. 956 cDNAs were carefully selected for inclusion on this microarray, including many early response genes identified in various experimental systems. The size of this array facilitates high quality array production, validation, and data generation. Several novel aspects of the approaches described could be generally useful. We have established array quality benchmarks and empirical data analysis algorithms that are fully supported by extensive independent gene measurement. We also report the capacity for FMA to quantify the level of gene regulation. We have utilized FMA to characterize the time course from 1 to 6 h of gene responses occurring following activation of the GnRHR in the mouse LβT2 gonadotrope cell line (12Turgeon J.L. Kimura Y. Waring D.W. Mellon P.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 439-450Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This study reveals a highly structured response induced in the genetic signaling network. LβT2 cells were obtained from Pamela Mellon (University of California, San Diego) and were maintained at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in humidified air in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Mediatech) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Gemini). For experiments, 40–50 × 106cells were seeded in 15-cm dishes. The medium was replaced 24 h later with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 25 mm HEPES (Mediatech) and glutamine. 18 h later, the cells were treated with 100 nm GnRH or vehicle and were returned to the CO2 incubator for 1, 3, or 6 h. The incubation was stopped by aspirating the incubation medium and adding 10 ml of lysis buffer (4 m guanidinium thiocyanate, 25 mm sodium citrate, pH 7.0, 0.5%N-laurylsarcosine, and 0.1 m 2-mercaptoethanol). Total RNA was isolated according to the method of Chomczynski and Sacchi (13Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63145) Google Scholar). Approximately 400 μg of total RNA was obtained from each plate. Plasmids were purified using the Qiaprep 96 Turbo Miniprep kit. Following insert amplification by PCR, products were confirmed by agarose gel electrophoresis and purified with Qiaquick 96 kit (Qiagen). The product was dried, dissolved in either 18 μl of H2O, 50% Me2SO, or 3× SSC, and spotted (3 hits/feature) with a GMS 417 Arrayer (Affymetrix) on CMT-GAPS-coated glass slides (Corning). DNA was fixed either by incubating the slide for 3.5 h at 40 °C followed by 10 min at 100 °C or for 2 h at 85 °C or by UV cross-linking with 90 mJ (Stratalinker, Stratagene). The suspension solutions and fixing protocols were compared in a 3×3 design because feature morphology may be influenced by surface tension effects arising from surface and spotting solution chemistry and by attachment efficiency. We evaluated feature morphology and attachment by hybridizing a small test array with a Cy5-labeled oligonucleotide complementary to one of the amplification primers (5′-CGT TTT ACA ACG TCG TGA CTG GG-3′). The optimum morphology and intensity were reproducibly observed, independently of insert sequence or size, with the PCR product dissolved in 50% Me2SO and fixed for 2 h at 85 °C to CMT-GAPS-coated slides, which was used for subsequent array production (Fig. 1). The 956 clones were selected from a NIA 15K library (14Tanaka T.S. Jaradat S.A. Lim M.K. Kargul G.J. Wang X. Grahovac M.J. Pantano S. Sano Y. Piao Y. Nagaraja R. Doi H. Wood III, W.H. Becker K.G. Ko M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9127-9132Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar) or purchased from Research Genetics. The gene selection was based on literature searches, input from collaborating laboratories, and unpublished data. A large number of genes known to be induced at early time points in other experimental systems were included as well as 67 putative “housekeeping” genes. The quality of the libraries utilized and the reliability of the clone picking and isolation were evaluated by sequencing 119 clones on the array, including randomly selected clones on each 96-well plate and all genes that were subsequently identified as regulated. 92% of the clones picked from the NIA library and 82% of the clones purchased from Research Genetics had been correctly identified. Based on the distribution of clone sources, we estimate that clone identification of the unsequenced clones on the array was 91% accurate. 98.7% of the clones generated sufficient PCR product to be detectable by gel electrophoresis. In order to distinguish signals arising from surface artifacts and facilitate analysis, the selected genes were spotted in triplicate. Arrays were stored light-protected at room temperature until use. A test hybridization using the Cy5-labeled oligomer confirmed the presence of all spotted genes at similar concentrations (see supplementary data, Fig. 7). 20 μg of total RNA from each sample was labeled with either Cy3 or Cy5 using the Atlas indirect labeling kit (CLONTECH) as indicated by the manufacturer. Following array prehybridization in 6× SSC, 0.5% SDS, and 1% bovine serum albumin at 42 °C for 45 min, the probe was denatured and hybridized in 24 μl of 50% formamid, 6× SSC, 0.5% SDS, and 5× Denhardt's with 2.4 μg of salmon sperm DNA and 10 μg of poly(dA) at 42 °C (room temperature for test oligomer hybridization) for 16 h. Following 10-min washes in 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS, and twice in 0.1× SSC, the slide was scanned using the GMS 418 Scanner (Affymetrix). We used a previously described protocol (15Yuen T. Ebersole B.J. Zhang W. Sealfon S.C. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 345: 556-569Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Briefly, 5 μg of total RNA was converted into cDNA, and 1:400 (∼250 pg) was utilized for 40-cycle three-step PCR in an ABI Prism 7700 in 20 mm Tris, pH 8.4, 50 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 200 μm dNTPs, 0.5× SYBR green (Molecular Probes), 200 nm each primer, and 0.25 units of Platinum Taq (Life Technologies). Amplicon size and reaction specificity were confirmed by agarose gel electrophoresis. The number of target copies in each sample was interpolated from its detection threshold (CT) value using a plasmid or purified PCR product standard curve included on each plate. The sequence of the 60 primer sets utilized can be found in the supplementary material. Each transcript in each sample was assayed five times, and the median CT values were used for analysis. Scanned microarray data were exported as TIFF files to Genepix (Axon Instruments), and spot registration was manually optimized as suggested by the developer. The median background-subtracted feature intensity was utilized for further analysis. Overall differences in the signal intensity of the two wavelengths measured on each slide (λ=532 nm and λ=635 nm) were corrected using the locally linear robust scatter plot smoother implemented in the loess function in S Plus Professional (Insightful Corporation). Predictors were generated using a symmetric distribution, span = 0.75 (16Venables W.N. Ripley B.D. Modern Applied Statistics with S-PLUS. 3rd Ed. Statistics and computing, Springer-Verlag, New York1999Crossref Google Scholar). The data quality from each array was estimated by determining the median coefficient of variation within each array for each gene, which indicates the overall variation of triplicate measurements on a given array, cv=100R¯∑i=1n(Ri−R¯)2n−1Equation 1 where R̄ is the geometric mean ratio for that gene on each slide, R i is each ratio, andn is the number of measurements. The sources of variation in these experiments were explored using analysis of variance for each gene measured (17Box G.E.P. Hunter W.G. Hunter J.S. Statistics for Experimenters: an Introduction to Design, Data Analysis, and Model Building. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1978: 165-207Google Scholar). Variance within and between experiments were determined. Variance within, SR2=∑t=1k∑i=1nt(yti−y¯t)2N−kEquation 2 where N is the total number of measurements of each gene, k is the number of arrays, nt is the number of measurements of each gene on each array,y ti is the individual ratio, andȳ t is the average ratio for that gene on each array. Variance between, ST2=∑t=1knt(y¯t−y¯)2k−1Equation 3 where k is the number of arrays,nt is the number of measurements, andȳ is the average ratio for that gene from all experiments. In order to select genes for further study, t values for the log transform ratios (r) were determined for data from each slide. t=r¯ns,where s=∑i=1n(ri−r¯)2n−1Equation 4 Genes were selected according to the following algorithm: (i) ± fold-change of >1.3, (ii) ∣t∣ >3, (iii) signal intensity >1% of the median signal intensity value in at least one channel, and (iv) criteria i–iii observed in at least two of three experiments. The early transcriptional response to GnRH was studied in the GnRHR-expressing LβT2 gonadotrope cell line (12Turgeon J.L. Kimura Y. Waring D.W. Mellon P.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 439-450Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Three separate experiments comparing the effects of a 1-h exposure to GnRH or vehicle were performed. Hybridization was uniform across all arrays, and background signal was low (Fig. 2). Data reproducibility and labeling bias were assessed by repeating the labeling and hybridization for one pair of samples two additional times, once with the control (Cy3) and treated (Cy5) labels reversed. The reliability of the data generated from these five microarray experiments was substantiated by the reproducibility of measurements within arrays, between arrays, and between experiments. The pattern of hybridization observed was qualitatively similar for all experiments (Fig. 2). Because the triplicate measurements within each array were nearly identical for each of the five hybridizations (median cv, 8–13%), regulated genes could reliably be distinguished from surface artifacts (Fig. 2 D). The reproducibility of the three measurements of each gene on each slide was utilized in our data analysis algorithm (see below). When the identical two RNA samples (control and treated) were labeled repeatedly, a high linear correlation was obtained for the ratios of the regulated genes (r=0.985). Similar analysis of a dye swap experiment also showed a very high correlation, r = 0.975. These data indicate that the relative expression obtained from these comparisons are reproducible and do not show sequence bias, as has been reported with direct labeling protocols (18Taniguchi M. Miura K. Iwao H. Yamanaka S. Genomics. 2001; 71: 34-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). To determine the relative sources of variability in the microarray experiments, an analysis of variance was performed on the data from these five hybridizations. There are several sources of variation in these experiments: (i) the variation between the triplicate measurements for each gene on each array, (ii) the variation between the measurement of each gene obtained by repeated labeling and hybridization, and (iii) the variation between the levels of each mRNA that occur in independent, replicated experiments. The median variance for the triplicate measurements within each array, which represents the variation of the three repeated measurements, was sR2 = 0.0198 for all arrays, indicating a very low level of variability. The two potential sources of variability between replicated experiments can be distinguished by comparing the analysis of replicate hybridizations of the same samples (n=3) and of repeated, independent experiments (n=3). The median sample variances between the ratios obtained with repeated labeling/hybridization of the same samples and between RNA samples obtained from independent experiments were sT2 = 0.073 and sT2 = 0.071, respectively. These data reveal similar levels of variation between the measurements obtained from repeated assays of the same samples and of samples from independent experiments. Thus the level of variation between the regulation of mRNAs in replicate experiments was so low that it does not add appreciably to the modest measurement variation resulting from the hybridization procedure. Scatter graphs of data from the three independent stimulation experiments, normalized using the robust locally linear loess function, are shown in Fig. 3. We preferred this normalization to an overall linear correction because it compensates for variation of the correction factor with signal intensity and is largely unaffected by outliers, which include the regulated transcripts. Most transcripts are not regulated, and the normalized data are tightly grouped along y = x. The triplets corresponding to several regulated genes are evident and show similar regulation and scatter graph location in all three independent experiments. These strikingly similar results obtained in independent experiments reflect a high level of reliability and reproducibility in all aspects of these studies, including array production, cell culture and treatment, RNA extraction, labeling, hybridization, and data acquisition. In order to identify candidate genes whose regulation is less marked than the visually obvious triplets indicated in Fig. 3, an empirical selection algorithm was implemented. The presence of triplicate features for each cDNA allowed calculation of a t statistic for each gene on each array (see “Experimental Procedures”). The criteria utilized to select the regulated gene candidates were based on fold-change (>±1.3), the t statistic (∣t∣>3), and signal intensity (>1% of median signal intensity in at least one channel) within each experiment (see “Experimental Procedures”). Genes that met these criteria in at least two independent experiments were selected for further study. This selection strategy identified 31 candidate regulated genes, 28 of which increased and 3 of which decreased (see below). Four of these genes (Rgs2, TSC22, PRL1, andNrf2) were represented by two different clones and spotted in different locations on the arrays. In all four cases, regulation was detected by our criteria, and the degree of change was similar (Rgs2, 4.0 ± 1.3, 2.9 ± 1.2;TSC22, 3.4 ± 0.4, 3.3 ± 0.6; PRL1, 2.0 ± 0.4, 1.5 ± 0.4; Nrf2, 1.3 ± 0.2, 1.3 ± 0.1). These data indicate that the observed changes were independent of position on the array. The measurement accuracy of the microarray and the biological variability of the transcriptional program identified were evaluated through a validation study comprising real-time PCR assays of 60 transcripts, including 26 genes that met the threshold for regulation in the microarray assay. To generate accurate and precise reference measurements of these genes, five measurements were made of each gene in each RNA sample, and the measurements were calibrated with a standard curve included on each PCR plate (Fig. 4). Nine experimental pairs of vehicle and GnRH-treated cultures were tested, including the microarray assayed samples. 100% (17 of 17) of the gene changes showing >1.6-fold change on the microarray and 66% (6 of 9) of gene changes showing between 1.3- and 1.6-fold changes were confirmed by PCR. All of the confirmed genes were up-regulated (Table I). Three genes, which showed a low level of regulation on the microarray, had less than 1.3-fold regulation (below the threshold for regulation) with the real-time PCR, but the actual fold-change measurements were actually relatively close (Table I). Three of 32 genes that appeared to be unregulated on the microarray were found to be up-regulated by real-time PCR (Table I). Thus the algorithm utilized to identify regulated genes was able to correctly identify regulated transcripts showing changes as low as 1.3-fold regulation on the microarray.Table IFold-changes ± S.E. from the early gene microarray compared to real-time PCRValues meeting the criteria for up- or down-regulation are indicated by red or green, respectively. The identification of all clones listed was confirmed by sequencing. Open table in a new tab Values meeting the criteria for up- or down-regulation are indicated by red or green, respectively. The identification of all clones listed was confirmed by sequencing. This data set of 5400 PCR assays provides a reference standard that allows assessment of the accuracy of the microarray and reliable quantification of the degree of regulation of these transcripts following GnRH exposure. The accuracy of the fold-change determinations obtained from the microarray was poor for transcripts showing high degrees of regulation (Table I), but the fold-change was meaningful for transcripts showing less extreme levels of induction. The power function correlation for the fold-change measurements by microarray and real-time PCR for genes showing <20-fold regulation by PCR (n=24) was r = 0.87 (Table I and Fig. 5). These data indicate that the microarray measurements can be calibrated to provide a quantitative estimate of the degree of gene regulation. Our data reveal that GnRHR activation modulates the expression of a large number of genes. The regulated genes identified include transcription factors (e.g. Klf4, Egr1, andEgr2), cell signaling modulators (e.g. Rgs2 and IκB), channel regulators (gem), and proteins contributing to cytoskeletal dynamics (γ-actin and transgelin). More than half of the induced genes are transcription factors, including both activators and repressors, with the major structural motifs encoded being leucine zipper factors (c-jun, Nrf2, LRG21, andTSC22) and zinc finger proteins (Egr1,Egr2, Klf4, Klf-like EST, andNr4a1) (Table I and Fig. 6). Many immediate early genes are known to be only transiently induced by various stimuli. Analysis of samples obtained from cells exposed to GnRH for 3 and 6 h reveals that nearly all of the induced genes return to baseline levels of expression by 3 h (Table I). A commonality of many induced transcripts is that the proteins encoded, after synthesis, would contribute to subsequent down-regulation of receptor-activated signaling. This category includes Fos, Rgs2, IκB, MKP1, PRL1, and gem (see “Discussion”). We have identified a broad, robust, and transient transcriptional response to the activation of the GnRH receptor. The proteins encoded by the induced genes represent five categories: transcription factors, cytoskeletal proteins, signaling mediators, channel regulators, and proteins of miscellaneous or unknown function (Fig. 6). Several of the genes that we have newly discovered to be regulated by GnRH have obvious implications for the function of the GnRH signaling system. For example, Klf4 is a zinc-finger protein in the Sp/XKLF family (19Philipsen S. Suske G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 2991-3000Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). Sp1 sites in the LHβ promoter have been implicated in the response to pulsatile GnRH (20Weck J. Anderson A.C. Jenkins S. Fallest P.C. Shupnik M.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 472-485Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, our data raise the possibility that Klf4 may bind to the LHβ promoter and contribute to its GnRH-mediated activation. Notably, many induced transcripts can be recognized as encoding proteins that would down-regulate or suppress GnRHR-activated signaling. Fos is known to transrepress the induction of many genes (21Ofir R. Dwarki V.J. Rashid D. Verma I.M. Nature. 1990; 348: 80-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Rgs2 is a GTPase-activating protein that down-regulates the activity of Gαq (22De Vries L. Gist Farquhar M. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 138-144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), the major G-protein utilized by the GnRH receptor (23Grosse R. Schmid A. Schoneberg T. Herrlich A. Muhn P. Schultz G. Gudermann T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9193-9200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The small G-protein gem (kir) has recently been reported to down-regulate L-type calcium channel function (24Beguin P. Nagashima K. Gonoi T. Shibasaki T. Takahashi K. Kashima Y. Ozaki N. Geering K. Iwanaga T. Seino S. Nature. 2001; 411: 701-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). The induction of gem by GnRH could contribute to the modulation of GnRH-induced gonadotropin release and MAP kinase activation, which both depend on L-channel activation (25Mulvaney J.M. Zhang T. Fewtrell C. Roberson M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29796-29804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). IκB inhibits NFκB signaling. MKP1 and PRL1 are both phosphatases that could attenuate GnRHR signaling mediated by kinase activation. The pattern of gene induction observed reveals that the first wave of genes induced by GnRH represents a seamless transition between the cellular signaling network and the downstream gene responses representing the ultimate targets of this signaling. The components of this gene network we have identified that (after synthesis) can suppress more proximal GnRH signaling intermediates are likely to play a significant role in modulating the responses to receptor activation. For example, our data reveal the rapid induction of Rgs2 by GnRH, which would likely attenuate GnRH receptor signaling. We speculate that a sinusoidal induction of Rgs2 by pulsatile receptor stimulation could contribute to the well known frequency dependence of downstream secondary genes. The activation or suppression of specific secondary gene targets is dictated by a combinatorial code. Induction of a specific secondary gene requires the presence of a particular combination of induced and constitutive factors and a relative absence of repressors for that promoter. Because the genetic network activates transcripts that encode proteins for activators and repressors as well as feedback inhibitors to signaling, it is ideally structured to generate different patterns of co-expressed activating and repressing factors in response to different stimuli. This formulation is consonant with the known control of secondary targets, such as the LHβ gene. The LHβ promoter binds transcription factors relatively weakly and requires the presence of multiple distinct activating proteins for efficient transcription (3Tremblay J.J. Drouin J. Mol. Cell.

NE10790 is a phosphonocarboxylate analogue of the potent bisphosphonate risedronate and is a weak anti-resorptive agent. Although NE10790 was a poor inhibitor of FPP synthase, it did inhibit prenylation in J774 macrophages and osteoclasts, but only of proteins of molecular mass ∼22–26 kDa, the prenylation of which was not affected by peptidomimetic inhibitors of either farnesyl transferase (FTI-277) or geranylgeranyl transferase I (GGTI-298). These 22–26-kDa proteins were shown to be geranylgeranylated by labelling J774 cells with [3H]geranylgeraniol. Furthermore, NE10790 inhibited incorporation of [14C]mevalonic acid into Rab6, but not into H-Ras or Rap1, proteins that are modified by FTase and GGTase I, respectively. These data demonstrate that NE10790 selectively prevents Rab prenylation in intact cells. In accord, NE10790 inhibited the activity of recombinant Rab GGTase in vitro, but did not affect the activity of recombinant FTase or GGTase I. NE10790 therefore appears to be the first specific inhibitor of Rab GGTase to be identified. In contrast to risedronate, NE10790 inhibited bone resorption in vitro without markedly affecting osteoclast number or the F-actin “ring” structure in polarized osteoclasts. However, NE10790 did alter osteoclast morphology, causing the formation of large intracellular vacuoles and protrusion of the basolateral membrane into large, “domed” structures that lacked microvilli. The anti-resorptive activity of NE10790 is thus likely due to disruption of Rab-dependent intracellular membrane trafficking in osteoclasts.

Prenylation (either farnesylation or geranylgeranylation) is essential for the function of the modified proteins, because it is required both for membrane association and for specific protein-protein interactions (1Seabra M.C. Cell Signal. 1998; 10: 167-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). FPP and GGPP, which are sequentially produced by condensation reactions involving FPP synthase and GGPP synthase, are products of the mevalonate pathway, which is also responsible for the biosynthesis of cholesterol. The process of prenylation is carried out by one of three protein:prenyl transferase enzymes, the specificity being determined by the prenylation motif in the protein substrate. Proteins with a cysteine residue four positions from the C terminus (CAAX motif) are modified by either protein:farnesyl transferase (FTase), which farnesylates proteins such as Ras and lamins, or protein:geranylgeranyl transferase I (GGTase I), which geranylgeranylates small GTPase proteins of the Rho family (e.g. Rho, Rac, and Cdc42; molecular mass, ∼21 kDa) and others such as Rap. A distinct protein:geranylgeranyl transferase (Rab GGTase, also known as GGTase II) geranylgeranylates small GTPases of the Rab family (molecular mass, 22–26 kDa) on two C-terminal cysteine residues contained in motifs such as CCXX,X CX C, or XX CC (2Glomset J.A. Farnsworth C.C. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 181-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). This modification also requires the participation of an additional protein, Rab escort protein (REP), which binds unprenylated Rab and presents it to Rab GGTase (3Anant J.S. Desnoyers L. Machius M.

Several effective and specific inhibitors of both FTase and GGTase I have been developed, such as the peptidomimetic inhibitors FTI-277 and GGTI-298 (4Lerner E.C. Qian Y. Blaskovich M.A. Fossum R.D.

However, a specific inhibitor of Rab GGTase has not yet been identified. Although metabolites of the monoterpene limonene are able to inhibit one or more protein:prenyl transferase, none of these specifically inhibits Rab GGTase. For example, perillyl alcohol inhibits Rab GGTase, but also GGTase I in cell-free lysates and intact 3T3 cells (6Ren Z. Elson C.E. Gould M.N. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1997; 54: 113-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), whereas other monoterpenes, such as perillic acid, inhibit FTase and GGTase I only (7Hardcastle I.R. Rowlands M.G. Barber A.M. Grimshaw R.M. Mohan M.K. Nutley B.P. Jarman M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1999; 57: 801-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Recently, some bisphosphonate drugs have been shown to act by preventing protein prenylation (8Luckman S.P. Hughes D.E. Coxon F.P. Russell R.G.G. Rogers M.J. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1998; 13: 581-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (1073) Google Scholar). Bisphosphonates (BPs) are synthetic inhibitors of bone resorption, a property that has led to their use in the treatment of bone diseases characterized by excessive resorption, such as post-menopausal osteoporosis and tumor-associated bone disease (9Russell R.G.G.

Thompson K. Coxon F.P. Luckman S.P. Hahn F.M. Poulter C.D. Ebetino F.H. Rogers M.J. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2001; 296: 235-242PubMed Google Scholar, 12van Beek E. Pieterman E. Cohen L. Lowik C.

Biophys. 2000; 373: 231-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). This results in the depletion of FPP and GGPP required for prenylation of small GTPase proteins that are essential for osteoclast function. Loss of geranylgeranylated proteins appears to be the cause of the anti-resorptive effects of these BPs on osteoclasts, because loss of osteoclast function can be overcome by the addition of geranylgeraniol, which bypasses inhibition of FPP synthase and replenishes the cells with a substrate for protein geranylgeranylation (14Fisher J.E. Rogers M.J. Halasy J.M. Luckman S.P. Hughes D.E. Masarachia P.J. Wesolowski G. Russell R.G.G. Rodan G.A. Reszka A.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Res. 1999; 14: 722-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). In addition, we have suggested that bisphosphonates disrupt osteoclast function as a result of loss of geranylgeranylation of small GTPases by GGTase I, such as Rho, Rac, and Cdc42, because an inhibitor of GGTase I (GGTI-298) closely mimics the effects of BPs (16Coxon F.P. Helfrich M.H. Van't Hof R. Sebti S. Ralston S.H. Hamilton A. Rogers M.J. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2000; 15: 1467-1476Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). Because of the lack of a specific inhibitor of Rab GGTase, the effect of loss of prenylation of Rab small GTPases in osteoclasts could not be assessed. There is evidence that some bisphosphonates and their analogues may be able to inhibit other enzymes of the mevalonate pathway. Some nitrogen-containing BPs can also inhibit squalene synthase (17Amin D. Cornell S.A. Gustafson S.K. Needle S.J. Ullrich J.W. Bilder G.E. Perrone M.H. J.

Chem. 1993; 268: 24832-24837Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which is involved in the synthesis of cholesterol and also uses FPP as a substrate. Furthermore, a recent study has demonstrated that certain bisphosphonate analogues of FPP are able to inhibit FTase (19Holstein S.A. Cermak D.M. Wiemer D.F. Lewis K. Hohl R.J. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 1998; 6: 687-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). NE10790 (see Fig. 1 A) is an analogue of the nitrogen-containing BP RIS, in which one of the phosphonate groups is replaced with a carboxylate group (20Ebetino F.H. Bayless A.V. Ambugey J.I Ibbotsen K.J. Dansereau S. Ebrahiimpour A. Phosphorus, Sulfur, and Silicon. 1996; 109–110: 217-220Crossref Scopus (4) Google Scholar). NE10790 retains the ability to inhibit bone resorption in vivo, although its anti-resorptive potency in rodents is markedly reduced compared with RIS (20Ebetino F.H. Bayless A.V. Ambugey J.I Ibbotsen K.J. Dansereau S. Ebrahiimpour A. Phosphorus, Sulfur, and Silicon. 1996; 109–110: 217-220Crossref Scopus (4) Google Scholar). At least part of this loss of potency is due to the fact that NE10790 has reduced affinity for bone, because the loss of one of the phosphonate groups allows binding of only one calcium ion (21van Beek E.R. Lowik C.W. Ebetino F.H. Papapoulos S.E. Bone. 1998; 23: 437-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). However, it remains unclear whether this compound is also less effective at affecting osteoclast function at the cellular level or indeed whether it inhibits bone resorption by the same molecular mechanism as nitrogen-containing BPs (that is, by inhibition of FPP synthase). NE10485 (see Fig. 1 A) is an analogue of NE10790 in which the nitrogen of the heterocyclic group is methylated and the hydroxyl group attached to the central carbon is replaced with hydrogen. The anti-resorptive potency of this compound has not been characterized. In this study we demonstrate that NE10790 is a poor inhibitor of FPP synthase and does not inhibit protein prenylation indiscriminately. Rather, this compound selectively prevents the geranylgeranylation of Rab small GTPases in several cell types in vitro, including osteoclasts, as a result of specific inhibition of Rab GGTase. NE10790, NE10485, and RIS (see Fig. 1 A) were provided by Procter and Gamble Pharmaceuticals (Cincinnati, OH). The drugs were dissolved in PBS, and the pH was adjusted to 7.4 with 1n NaOH and then filter-sterilized by using a 0.2-μm filter. Mevastatin was purchased from Sigma and converted from the lactone as described by Luckman et al. (8Luckman S.P. Hughes D.E. Coxon F.P. Russell R.G.G. Rogers M.J. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1998; 13: 581-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (1073) Google Scholar). [3H]GGOH was from American Radiochemicals Ltd. (St Louis, MO). [14C]Mevalonic acid lactone, Enhance reagent, [1-3H] trans-FPP, and [1-3H]trans-GGPP were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Solvent was removed from [3H]GGOH and [14C]mevalonic acid lactone by evaporating in nitrogen. Recombinant human K-Ras, Rho, Rab1a, Rab escort protein (REP1) and recombinant human FTase, GGTase I, and Rab GGTase were purified as described previously (22Seabra M.C. James G.L. Methods Mol. Biol. 1998; 84: 251-260PubMed Google Scholar). All other reagents were from Sigma unless stated otherwise. The number of viable J774 macrophage cells was determined by MTT assay as previously described (23Luckman S.P. Coxon F.P. Ebetino F.H. Russell R.G.G. Rogers M.J. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1998; 13: 1668-1678Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). J774 cells were seeded at a density of 104cells/well into 96-well plates and then treated with RIS, NE10790, or NE10485 the following day in replicates of six wells. 48 h later, the reduction of MTT reagent was measured. Mature osteoclasts were isolated from 2-day-old New Zealand White rabbits as previously described (16Coxon F.P. Helfrich M.H. Van't Hof R. Sebti S. Ralston S.H. Hamilton A. Rogers M.J. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2000; 15: 1467-1476Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). Briefly, the long bones from each rabbit were removed and minced in α-minimum essential medium (Life Technologies, Inc.). After allowing the bone pieces to settle, the supernatant was transferred to a fresh tube, and fetal calf serum was added to a final concentration of 10%. The cells were seeded into 6-well or 96-well plates (Costar, Cambridge, MA). The following day, contaminating adherent cells in 6-well plates were removed by treatment with 0.001% Pronase, 0.002% EDTA in PBS. The remaining adherent cells (>95% tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase-positive osteoclasts) were rinsed twice in PBS and then cultured in fresh α-minimum essential medium containing 10% fetal calf serum plus treatments under investigation. Detection of prenylated proteins in J774 macrophages and purified rabbit osteoclasts was carried out as described previously (16Coxon F.P. Helfrich M.H. Van't Hof R. Sebti S. Ralston S.H. Hamilton A. Rogers M.J. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2000; 15: 1467-1476Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar, 24Coxon F.P. Benford H.L. Russell R.G.G. Rogers M.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 631-638PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were depleted of mevalonate by incubation with 5 μm mevastatin for 4 h and then transferred into fresh medium containing 5 μm mevastatin and either 7.5 μCi/ml [14C]mevalonic acid lactone or 30 μCi/ml [3H]GGOH, plus RIS, NE10790, NE10485, FTI-277, or GGTI-298. After 18 h the cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 0.1% (w/v) sodium dodecyl sulfate, 0.5% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate in PBS, plus 1:100 (v/v) Sigma protease inhibitor mixture), and then 50 μg of cell lysate from each treatment were electrophoresed on 12% polyacrylamide-SDS gels under reducing conditions. After electrophoresis, the gels were fixed in 10% (v/v) acetic acid, 40% (v/v) methanol, 50% (v/v) distilled water, and then14C-labeled gels were dried, and labeled proteins were visualized on a Bio-Rad Personal FX Imager after exposure to a Kodak phosphorimaging screen. 3H-Labeled gels were incubated in Enhance for 30 min prior to drying. 3H-Labeled proteins were then visualized by exposing the gel to preflashed Hyperfilm-MP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 6 days at −70 °C. J774 cells were seeded at 2 × 106 cells/well in a 6-well plate and then metabolically labeled the following day with [14C]mevalonic acid as described above. Whole cell lysates were prepared in 1 ml of RIPA buffer and assayed for protein content, and then equal amounts of protein (∼500 μg) were incubated with 2 μg of rabbit polyclonal Rab6 antibody or 1 μg/ml goat polyclonal Rap1A antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) at 4 °C for 1 h. 20 μl of protein G-Sepharose were then added, and incubation was continued overnight. For immunoprecipitation of Ras, lysates were incubated at 4 °C overnight with 20 μl of Ha-Ras antibody conjugated to agarose beads (Oncogene Science, Manhasset, NY). The beads were pelleted by centrifugation at 2,500 rpm for 5 min in a microcentrifuge and washed four times in RIPA buffer. 20 μl of 2× Laemmli sample buffer were added to each Sepharose pellet and boiled for 5 min, and the entire sample was electrophoresed on 12% polyacrylamide-SDS gels. Radiolabeled bands were then visualized as described above. Purified rabbit osteoclasts and J774 macrophages were treated for 24 h and then lysed in RIPA buffer. After determining the protein content, 20 μg (J774 lysate) or 60 μg (osteoclast lysate) from each sample were electrophoresed under reducing conditions on 12% polyacrylamide-SDS gels. The proteins were transferred on to polyvinyl difluoride membrane by semi-dry transfer and blocked overnight with 5% (w/v) skimmed milk in TBS with Tween 20. Membranes were then hybridized with 0.5 μg/ml rabbit polyclonal Rab6 antibody or 1 μg/ml goat polyclonal Rap1A antibody, followed by 1 μg/ml anti-rabbit or anti-goat IgG-peroxidase conjugate. Blots were visualized after incubation with SuperSignal (Pierce), using a Bio-Rad FluorS Max imager. FPP synthase was assayed as described previously (11Dunford J.E. Thompson K. Coxon F.P. Luckman S.P. Hahn F.M. Poulter C.D. Ebetino F.H. Rogers M.J. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2001; 296: 235-242PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 40 μl of assay buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.7, 10 mm NaF, 2 mmMgCl2, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol) containing 2 nmol [1-14C]isopentenyl diphosphate (4 μCi/mmol) and 2 nmol GPP were prewarmed to 37 °C. The assay was initiated by the addition of 1 μl of recombinant human FPP synthase (with an activity of 8 pmol FPP/min) diluted to 10 μl with assay buffer. The assay was allowed to proceed for 30 min and was terminated by the addition of 200 μl of saturated NaCl. The samples were then extracted with 1 ml of water-saturated butan-1-ol, and the amount of radioactivity in the upper phase was determined by mixing 0.5 ml of the butyl alcohol with 4 ml of general purpose scintillant. This was then counted using a Packard Tricarb 1900CA scintillation counter. To determine the effects of NE10790, RIS, and NE10485 on FPP synthase activity, the compounds were diluted to 5× final concentration in assay buffer and were preincubated with the enzyme preparation for 10 min prior to initiation of the reaction. The activity of recombinant human farnesyl transferase was determined by assessing the amount of [3H]farnesyl transferred from [3H]FPP to recombinant K-Ras (22Seabra M.C. James G.L. Methods Mol. Biol. 1998; 84: 251-260PubMed Google Scholar). The final concentrations of reagents in a standard reaction mix were 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.2, 150 mm KCl, 10 mm ZnCl2, 3 mm MgCl2, 0.2% (v/v) octyl-d-glucopyranoside (NOGA detergent), 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.9 μm FPP, 0.3 μm [3H]FPP (15–30 Ci/mmol), 40 nm FTase, and 15 μm K-Ras. NE10790, NE10485, and RIS were aliquoted into siliconized microcentrifuge tubes (Fisher) at 4 °C and added to the reaction mix. The reactions were initiated by transferring the tubes to 37 °C and incubated for 15 min, and then reactions were stopped by the addition of 400 μl of ethanol:HCl (9:1 v/v). The protein was allowed to precipitate at room temperature for 30 min and was then filtered on to glass microfiber filters (GF/C, Whatman). The tubes were washed three times with 1 ml of ethanol, and then the amount of radioactivity on each filter quantified by liquid scintillation counting following the addition of 5 ml of scintillation mixture. The assays were in duplicate and were repeated three times independently to verify reproducibility. The activity of recombinant human GGTase I and Rab GGTase were determined by assessing the amount of [3H]geranylgeranyl transferred from [3H]GGPP to Rho A and Rab1a, respectively (22Seabra M.C. James G.L. Methods Mol. Biol. 1998; 84: 251-260PubMed Google Scholar). The final concentrations in the GGTase I reaction mix were 50 mmTris, pH 7.2, 150 mm KCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 0.3 mm Nonidet P-40, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 5 μm GGPP, 0.5 μm[3H]GGPP (15–30 Ci/mmol), 58 nmGGTase I, and 10 μm RhoA. Final concentrations in the Rab GGTase reaction mix were 25 mm Tris, pH 7.2, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 3.6 μm GGPP, 0.4 μm [3H]GGPP, 0.04 μm Rab GGTase, 10 μm Rab1a, and 2.5 μm REP1. The assay was carried out as outlined above for the FTase assay, including a negative control (lacking REP1) for the Rab GGTase assay. The assays were in duplicate and were repeated three times independently to verify reproducibility. Osteoclast number, F-actin “rings,” and resorptive activity of mature rabbit osteoclasts in vitro were assessed as described previously (16Coxon F.P. Helfrich M.H. Van't Hof R. Sebti S. Ralston S.H. Hamilton A. Rogers M.J. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2000; 15: 1467-1476Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). Briefly, rabbit osteoclasts were allowed to adhere for 2 h on 5-mm-diameter elephant tusk dentine discs in 96-well plates and then cultured with fresh α-minimum essential medium in the presence or absence of RIS, NE10790, or NE10485. 48 h later, intracellular F-actin was visualized by staining with tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate (TRITC)-phalloidin, and the number of actin rings, defined as a distinct and complete ring of podosomes, per disc was then counted (actin rings are an indication of osteoclast polarization, and their presence correlates highly with active resorption). The discs were then stained for tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase by incubating with naphthol-ASBI-phosphate, hexazotized pararosanilin, and 50 mm tartrate in acetate buffer, pH 5.5, at 37 °C for 30 min (25van't Hof R.J. Tuinenburg-Bol R.A. Nijweide P.J. Int. J. Exp. Pathol. 1995; 76: 205-214PubMed Google Scholar). To detect the total number of osteoclasts in the cultures, the number of multinucleated (>2 nuclei/cell), tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase-positive cells/disc was then counted. To assess osteoclastic resorption, the discs were immersed in 20% (w/v) sodium hypochlorite to remove all cells, and then resorption pits in the mineral surface were visualized by reflected light microscopy. The area of the pits/disc was then examined using a Zeiss Axiolab reflective light microscope and quantified using software developed in-house based on Aphelion (ADCIS, France) ActiveX components. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was carried out on osteoclasts that had been seeded on to dentine discs and treated as described above. After 48 h, the cells were fixed in 2.5% (v/v) glutaraldehyde and 2.5 mm MgCl2 in 0.89m phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, for 20 h at room temperature. Thereafter they were washed in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, post-fixed in osmium tetroxide for 1.5 h, then washed in distilled water, and dehydrated through a graded series of ethanol solutions. The samples were then critical point dried from CO2, glued onto aluminum stubs with colloidal silver adhesive, and sputter coated with 20 nm platinum and examined in a Jeol JSM-35CF scanning electron microscope operating at 10 kV. To quantify the results, osteoclasts throughout the whole dentine disc were identified and scored according to their morphology. “Normal” osteoclasts were defined as those that were well spread, with numerous microvilli on the basolateral surface (the membrane not apposed to the bone surface). “Retracted” osteoclasts were defined as those in which the peripheral membrane adjacent to the dentine surface was completely retracted or showed evidence of retraction fibers. “Domed” osteoclasts were defined as those in which one or more regions of the basolateral membrane were both raised and devoid of microvilli. For morphological studies, rabbit osteoclasts were cultured as above for 48 h on dentine slices without reagents or with 10–100 μm RIS or 500–1000 μmNE10790. The cultures were fixed for 10 min in a 1:1 (v:v) mixture of minimum essential medium and fixation buffer (3.5% (w/v) paraformaldehyde, 2% (w/v) sucrose in PBS). The cells were then permeablized in Triton buffer (20 mm Hepes, 300 mm sucrose, 50 mm NaCl, 3 mmMgCl2, 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100, 0.5% (w/v) sodium azide, in PBS at pH 7.0) at 4 °C and then immunostained for paxillin using a mouse monoclonal antibody (10 μg/ml) and secondary fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse Ig polyclonal antibodies (1:40 dilution) (Dako, Denmark). Resorbing osteoclasts were identified by their characteristic F-actin ring structure (described above) after staining with TRITC-phalloidin conjugate (Molecular Probes) at 5 units/ml. The dentine surface was examined by simultaneous confocal reflection microscopy where resorbed areas could be identified by their reduced reflection. Scanning laser confocal microscopy was performed on a Leica TCS NT system (Heidelberg, Germany). Fluorescent images were collected in sequential 1-μm steps through the osteoclasts for fluorescein isothiocyanate and TRITC fluorochromes and reflection at 488-, 568-, and 647-nm emission wavelengths, respectively, and displayed in the xy and zx planes. For electron microscopic analysis, rabbit osteoclasts were treated with or without 1 mm NE10790 for 48 h on dentine slices. The cells were fixed in 2.5% (v/v) glutaraldehyde in phosphate buffer (0.1 m, pH 7.4) for a minimum of 24 h and then demineralized in the same fixative with 2.5% (w/v) EDTA for ∼48 h. The samples were then washed in buffer, postfixed in osmium tetroxide, dehydrated in ethanol, and embedded in Epon. Ultrathin sections were stained using uranyl acetate and lead citrate and then examined using a Philips EM201 microscope. RIS dramatically and dose-dependently reduced the number of viable J774 cells with an IC50 of approximately 30 μm (Fig.1 B). NE10790 also reduced viable J774 cell number but was ∼40 times less potent than RIS (IC50, ∼1.2 mm). By contrast, NE10485 had no effect on cell viability at concentrations up to 3 mm. RIS potently inhibited recombinant human FPP synthase in vitro with an IC50 value of 10 nm ± 10 nm(n = 4; Fig. 1 C). By contrast, neither NE10790 nor NE10485 affected FPP synthase at concentrations up to 100 μm, although at higher concentrations up to 1 mm, both NE10790 and NE10485 partially inhibited (30–50%) FPP synthase activity in vitro. The effect of NE10790, RIS, and NE10485 on protein prenylation was investigated by examining the incorporation of [14C] mevalonic acid into prenylated proteins in J774 cells in vitro. Whereas 100 μm RIS inhibited the incorporation of [14C]mevalonic acid into all prenylated small GTPases (21–26 kDa) and higher molecular mass proteins (∼60 kDa, most likely farnesylated lamin B and prelamin A), 1.5 mm NE10790 inhibited incorporation of [14C]mevalonic acid into bands of prenylated small GTPases of higher molecular mass only (22–26 kDa proteins; most likely Rab GTPases based on molecular mass) (Fig.2 A). The effect of NE10790 was dose-dependent, with complete inhibition of incorporation of [14C]mevalonic acid into 22–26-kDa proteins at a concentration of 1 mm (Fig. 2 B). The IC50 for inhibition of Rab prenylation in J774 cells was calculated from densitometric analysis of the 22–26-kDa bands and was determined to be 560 ± 120 μm (n = 3). The intense radiolabel at the dye front, which probably represents isoprenoids such as GGPP (8Luckman S.P. Hughes D.E. Coxon F.P. Russell R.G.G. Rogers M.J. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1998; 13: 581-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (1073) Google Scholar), was unaffected by treatment with NE10790 but was completely absent in lysates of RIS-treated cells (Fig. 2 A). 1.5 mm NE10485 had no effect on either protein prenylation or the abundance of radiolabeled isoprenoids at the dye front (Fig. 2 A). The effect of NE10790 on incorporation of [14C]mevalonic acid into prenylated proteins in J774 cells was compared with the effects of peptidomimetic inhibitors of FTase and GGTase I. An FTase inhibitor, FTI-277 (10 μm), prevented incorporation of [14C]mevalonic acid into bands of around 60 kDa (farnesylated lamins), whereas 15 μm GGTI-298, an inhibitor of GGTase I, reduced incorporation of [14C]mevalonic acid into a broad band with a molecular mass of 21 kDa, most likely consisting of geranylgera"
https://openalex.org/W1981762712,"There is a need to understand the mechanisms of neural synchronization during development because correlated rhythmic activity is thought to be critical for the establishment of proper connectivity. The relative importance of chemical and electrical synapses for synchronization of electrical activity during development is unclear. We examined the activity patterns of identified spinal neurons at the onset of motor activity in zebrafish embryos. Rhythmic activity appeared early and persisted upon blocking chemical neurotransmission but was abolished by inhibitors of gap junctions. Paired recordings revealed that active spinal neurons were electrically coupled and formed a simple network of motoneurons and a subset of interneurons. Thus, the earliest spinal central pattern generator consists of synchronously active, electrically coupled neurons."

Studies using skin-originated CS-B fibroblast cells demonstrated an increased sensitivity to UV radiation, accompanied by a delay in RNA synthesis recovery (1Friedberg E.C. Bioessays. 1996; 18: 731-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 6Mayne L.V. Lehmann A.R. Cancer Res. 1982; 42: 1473-1478PubMed Google Scholar). The hypersensitivity of CS to UV radiation is attributed to a pronounced defect in the repair of DNA damage triggered by UV radiation (7Barrett S.F. Robbins J.H. Tarone R.E. Kraemer K.H. Mutat. Res. 1991; 255: 281-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The predominant DNA damage introduced by UV radiation is the generation of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers and 6-4 photoproduct adducts. These lesions are bulky and helix-distorting and can be removed by nucleotide excision repair (NER) in a transcription-coupled repair (TCR) pathway (8Balajee A.S. May A. Dianov G.L. Friedberg E.C.

A. 1986; 83: 8878-8882Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). It is generally believed that the inherited defects in TCR of NER constitute the molecular basis of CS (13van Hoffen A. Natarajan A.T. Mayne L.V. van Zeeland A.A. Mullenders L.H. Venema J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 5890-5895Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 14Venema J. Mullenders L.H.

However, the UV sensitivity alone may not explain the progressive neurodegeneration and other clinical appearances in CS because short wavelength radiation like UV cannot reach the inner organs and tissues. Thus, TCR of NER is unlikely to be the only pathway defective in CS. There are indications that CSB also plays a role in transcription and chromatin remodeling (9Balajee A.S. Bohr V.A. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 250: 15-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 15Citterio E. Van D.B., V Schnitzler G. Kanaar R. Bonte E. Kingston R.E. Hoeijmakers J.H. Vermeulen W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7643-7653Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that oxidative damage to DNA plays a vital role in the development of progeroid syndromes (16Kipling D. Faragher R.G. Mol. Pathol. 1997; 50: 234-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Living organisms are constantly exposed to oxidative stress from environmental agents, including ionizing radiation, and from endogenous metabolic processes. A significant consequence of oxidative stress is DNA base modifications, which can result in mutations and other types of genomic instability. 8-Hydroxyguanine (8-OH-Gua) is one of the principal modified bases in DNA resulting from oxidative damage, and it is repaired mainly by the process of base excision repair (BER) (17Dianov G. Bischoff C. Piotrowski J. Bohr V.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33811-33816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 18Dianov G. Bischoff C. Sunesen M. Bohr V.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 1365-1368Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Although TCR is responsible for processing some types of oxidative DNA damage in studies using CSB as a model (19Cooper P.K. Leadon S.A. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1994; 726: 330-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 20Le Page F. Klungland A. Barnes D.E. Sarasin A. Boiteux S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 1993; 90: 10499-10503Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar), alternative pathways for the function of CSB in the repair of DNA base modifications remain to be further elucidated. This laboratory reported that whole cell extract (WCE) from primary CSB cells incised 8-OH-dGuo at a reduced level in comparison with normal cell lines and that this BER deficiency in primary CS-B cells is associated with a down-regulated transcription of the human 8-hydroxyguanine glycosylase/apurinic site lyase (hOgg1) gene (18Dianov G. Bischoff C. Sunesen M. Bohr V.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 1365-1368Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). This deficiency can be complemented by transfection of the cells with the normalCSB gene (18Dianov G. Bischoff C. Sunesen M. Bohr V.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 1365-1368Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The human CSB gene encodes a protein of 1493 amino acids with a molecular mass of 168 kDa (5Troelstra C. van Gool A. de Wit J. Vermeulen W. Bootsma D. Hoeijmakers J.H. Cell. 1992; 71: 939-953Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar, 23Troelstra C. Odijk H. de Wit J. Westerveld A. Thompson L.H. Bootsma D. Hoeijmakers J.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 5806-5813Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). By sequence homology, theCSB gene product belongs to the SWI2/SNF2 family of proteins. All proteins in this family contain seven putative consecutive DNA and RNA helicase motifs (24Eisen J.A. Sweder K.S. Hanawalt P.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 2715-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1). In addition to the helicase motifs, CSB contains an acidic amino acid stretch, a glycine-rich region, and two putative nuclear localization signal sequences (5Troelstra C. van Gool A. de Wit J. Vermeulen W. Bootsma D. Hoeijmakers J.H. Cell. 1992; 71: 939-953Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1). Despite the presence of the conserved motifs, CSB has not been demonstrated to possess helicase activity as defined experimentally by an ability to unwind double-stranded DNA in a classic strand displacement assay (25Selby C.P. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1885-1890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). As are other members of the SWI/SNF subfamily, CSB is likely to be involved in a wide variety of cellular functions, including DNA repair, transcription regulation, maintenance of chromosome stability, and chromatin remodeling (9Balajee A.S. Bohr V.A. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 250: 15-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 26Pazin M.J. Kadonaga J.T. Cell. 1997; 88: 737-740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). However, limited information is available that addresses the functional significance of the individual motifs. The characterization of motif II of CSB in DNA repair has been performed by the construction of a point mutation in motif II in hamster cells (27Brosh R.M.J. Balajee A.S. Selzer R.R. Sunesen M. De Santis L.P. Bohr V.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3583-3594Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The motif II mutant lost the ability to confer cellular resistance to 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide (4-NQO) and UV exposure. Because motif II functions in ATP hydrolysis, the cellular data suggested that ATP hydrolysis by CSB was essential to certain types of DNA repair, for example the TCR of NER (27Brosh R.M.J. Balajee A.S. Selzer R.R. Sunesen M. De Santis L.P. Bohr V.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3583-3594Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Recent studies in this laboratory have shown that the BER of 8-OH-Gua was deficient inCSB null cells. However, we have found no evidence for a function of motif II in BER. 2R. Selzer, S. Nyaga, J. Tuo, A. May, M. Muftuoglu, M. Christiansen, E. Citterio, R. M. Brosh, Jr., and V. A. Bohr, submitted for publication.2R. Selzer, S. Nyaga, J. Tuo, A. May, M. Muftuoglu, M. Christiansen, E. Citterio, R. M. Brosh, Jr., and V. A. Bohr, submitted for publication. To gain further understanding of the importance of CSB protein in BER, site-specific mutations were introduced in various helicase motifs of the CSB protein in human cells. Stably transfected CS-B cell lines with altered CSB genes were established by transfecting plasmids containing a site-directed CSB mutation into CS1AN cells, a human CS-B fibroblast. The cell lines were tested for their sensitivity to oxidative stress, the ability of whole cell extract to repair modified DNA bases in vitro, and the accumulation of modified bases in genomic DNA after oxidative stress. We report here that CSB plays a role in lesion-specific BER and that helicase motifs V and VI of CSB are crucial in this function. We also find that mutations in certain motifs of CSB in human fibroblast lines lead to the accumulation of oxidative DNA base lesions in cells that have been exposed to oxidative stress. All cell lines were derived from CS1AN.S3.G2, a SV40-transformed human fibroblast cell line belonging to CS complementation group B. The characteristics of the cells have been previously described (28Mayne L.V. Priestley A. James M.R. Burke J.F. Exp. Cell Res. 1986; 162: 530-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The sensitivity of each cell line to UV was tested before use. CS1AN.S3.G2 transfected with the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.1 alone (Invitrogen; abbreviated as pc3.1) or pcDNA3.1 containing intact or constructed mutatedCSB gene are designated in Fig.1. A neomycin resistance gene in the pc3.1 plasmid was used for the selection. All cell lines were routinely grown in minimal essential medium supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum, 0.3 mg/ml l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 400 μg/ml geneticin (G418, Life Technologies, Inc.). Site-directed mutagenesis of CSB was performed by a uracil containing DNA based protocol (27Brosh R.M.J. Balajee A.S. Selzer R.R. Sunesen M. De Santis L.P. Bohr V.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3583-3594Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 29Kunkel T.A. Bebenek K. McClary J. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 204: 125-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar). The plasmid pcBLsSE6 with the entire human CSB cDNA was kindly provided by Dr. Jan Hoeijmakers. Mutations in CSBwere constructed to replace highly conserved residues in motifs Ia, III, IV, and VI of the putative helicase domain and in the second putative nucleotide-binding (NTB) domain. The design of most of the constructs is presented elsewhere. 3M. Muftuoglu, R. Selzer, J. Tuo, R. M. Robert, Jr., and V. A. Bohr, submitted for publication. The newly made CSBR946A was constructed by replacing arginine with alanine using primer 5′-CTCCATGCTGCCTCCCGGGCC-3′. After verification by sequencing, the wild type or mutated CSB genes were cloned into the mammalian expression vector pc3.1 and transfected into CS1AN.S3.G2 using SuperFect Transfection Reagent (Qiagen, Santa Clarita, CA). The cells were selected with complete medium containing geneticin (400 μg/ml). Individual colonies were screened for expression of the CSB transcript. The entire CSB transcript in the transfectant clones was verified by PCR. RNA was extracted using RNA STAT-60 (Tel-Test Inc., Friendswood, TX) followed by treatment with RNase-free DNase I (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). cDNA was synthesized by using a reverse transcription kit (RETROscript, Ambion, Austin, TX) with equal amounts of total RNA (5 μg) from various cell lines according to the manufacturer's recommendation. A high fidelity PCR master kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was used for PCR amplification of cDNA products. The CSB (4.7 kb) cDNA was amplified as six overlapping fragments using primers and annealing conditions as previously described (27Brosh R.M.J. Balajee A.S. Selzer R.R. Sunesen M. De Santis L.P. Bohr V.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3583-3594Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 30Mallery D.L. Tanganelli B. Colella S. Steingrimsdottir H. van Gool A.J. Troelstra C. Stefanini M.

PCR products were detected by electrophoresis on agarose gels with ethidium bromide staining (Fig.2 A). Relative quantitative RT-PCR was processed for comparing relative transcript abundance standardized by coamplification of CSB fragment and highly conserved fragments of 18 S rRNA from the transfected cell lines. The RNA isolation and cDNA synthesis were as described above. The primers 5′-GGTGTTAGGTGGCTGTGGGAATT-3′ and 5′-GTATCTCGTAAGACACACATGCACAC-3′ were used to produce a 671-base pair product from CSB mRNA (27Brosh R.M.J. Balajee A.S. Selzer R.R. Sunesen M.

The amplification using primers for 18 S ribosomal RNA produced a 488-base pair fragment. The linear range of PCR cycles for CSB was determined by titrating synthesized cDNA. For PCR amplification, 0.5 unit of AmpliTaq Gold (Applied Biosystems) was used according to the manufacturer's procedures. In addition to standard reaction components, PCR mixtures contained 0.2 μm ofCSB primers, 0.2 μm of 18 S RNA primer:competimer (4:6) (QuantumRNA Classic 18S, Ambion, Austin, TX) in a total volume of 50 μl. PCR hot start was 5 min at 80 °C, 5 min at 49 °C, 1 min at 94 °C, followed by 39 cycles consisting of 30 s at 94 °C, 45 s at 67 °C, 1 min at 72 °C, and one final extension cycle for 7 min at 72 °C. The ratio of CSB transcript and 18 S rRNA was determined by running 1% agarose gels and scanning with the ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). WCEs were used to evaluate the CSB protein expression. These WCEs were prepared as previously described (31Manley J.L. Fire A. Samuels M. Sharp P.A. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 568-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Equal amounts of protein (100 μg) were loaded on 3–8% polyacrylamide gels (NuPAGE) and resolved at 200 V for 1.5 h in NuPAGE Tris-acetate SDS running buffer (Invitrogen). The proteins were transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane at 100 V for 1 h at 4 °C in NuPAGE transfer buffer (Invitrogen). CSB was detected with human anti-ERCC6 IgG fraction monoclonal antibody (1:1000, Austral Biologicals, San Ramon, CA) and then hybridized with a peroxidase labeled anti-mouse IgG antibody (1:1000). The membrane was developed with a chemiluminescent substrate (ECL+ kit, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and then evaluated with a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager. Five hundred cells were seeded in 10-cm2 dishes and allowed to attach overnight. For UV and γ-radiation, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and then irradiated at the indicated doses with a UV lamp (254 nm) or with a Gammacell 40 Exactor 137Cs γ-source (Nordian International Inc., Kanata, Canada) and returned to complete medium. For 4-NQO treatment, the cells were washed and incubated with the indicated dose of 4-NQO in serum-free minimal medium for 30 min at 37 °C and then washed with phosphate-buffered saline and returned to complete medium. The cells were grown for 10 days, washed once with phosphate-buffered saline, fixed with methanol, and stained with methylene blue for colony counting. Three independent experiments were carried out with three parallel samples for each dose. The area under the curve (AUC) was used as the comprehensive survival index of each cell line and was calculated according to the trapezoid rule using software GraphPad Prism version 3.02 (32Piekoszewski W. Gubala W. Pol. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 52: 389-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The following oligonucleotides with a single lesion of 8-OH-Gua, 5-hydroxycytosine (5-OH-Cyt), or uracil at position 11 were employed (Midland Certified Reagent Co., Midland, TX): 5′-ATATACCGCG[8-OH-Gua]CCGGCCGATCAAGCTTAT-3′, 5′-ATATACCGCG[5-OH-Cyt]CCGGCCGATCAAGCTTAT-3′, and 5′-ATATACCGCG[Uracil]CCGGCCGATCAAGCTTAT-3′. All oligonucleotides were 32P-5′-end-labeled and annealed with the complementary strand as previously described (33Dianov G. Lindahl T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 3829-3833Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). An oligonucleotide with the same sequence as above but with a normal CG pair at the relevant position instead of the modified nucleotide was used as the control. Incision reactions contained 0.15 nmol of oligonucleotide duplex, 1 μg of poly(dI-dC) competimer, 20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.8, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm EDTA, 2 mm MgCl2, and 20 μg of WCE protein prepared as described (31Manley J.L. Fire A. Samuels M. Sharp P.A. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 568-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). After incubation at 37 °C for the indicated time, the reactions were terminated by the addition of 0.8 μl of 10% SDS and 0.8 μl of 5 mg/ml proteinase K and incubated for 10 min at 55 °C. In a 20-μl reaction mixture, DNA precipitation was carried out by adding 4 μl of 5 mg/ml glycogen (Ambion), 8 μl of 11 m ammonia acetate, and 135 μl of cold ethanol followed by incubation overnight at −20 °C. The samples were centrifuged for 1 h at 4 °C followed by washing with 500 μl of 70% ethanol. After centrifuging at 12,000 ×g for 10 min, the pellet was dried and resuspended in 10 μl of formamide loading dye (5% EDTA, 0.02% bromphenol blue, 0.02% xylene cyanol in 95% formamide), and the samples were separated by 20% denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (containing 7m urea, 89 mm Tris borate, pH 8.0, and 2 mm EDTA). The reaction products were visualized by autoradiography and quantified on a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics) using ImageQuant software. Liquid chromatography/isotope-dilution mass spectrometry was used to determine the accumulation of 8-OH-Gua in genomic DNA after exposure to γ-radiation. This technique measures the nucleoside form of 8-OH-Gua,i.e. 8-hydroxy-2′-deoxyguanosine (8-OH-dGuo) (34Dizdaroglu M. Jaruga P. Rodriguez H. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: E12Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). After irradiation at the indicated doses in a Gammacell 40 Exactor137Cs γ-source, the cells were incubated in the complete medium at 37 °C for 30 min. Cell pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer (0.5 m Tris, pH 8.0, 20 mm EDTA, 10 mm NaCl, 1% SDS, and 0.5 mg/ml proteinase K) and incubated at 37 °C overnight. Nuclear DNA was isolated by the salt extraction procedure (35Balajee A.S. DeSantis L.P. Brosh R.M.J. Selzer R. Bohr V.A. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 477-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 36Miller S.A. Dykes D.D. Polesky H.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 1215Crossref PubMed Scopus (17626) Google Scholar). The introduction of 8-hydroxy-2′-deoxyguanosine-8-18O, the digestion of DNA to nucleosides and the optimization of liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry parameters were performed as described (34Dizdaroglu M. Jaruga P. Rodriguez H. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: E12Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Groups were compared by means of one-way analysis of variance tests. Duncan's multiple range test was used for post hoc comparison of means. Differences were considered significant when p < 0.05. The validity of the CSB transfected cell lines was evaluated by sequencing and RT-PCR. All six overlapping segments of CSBwere detected from cDNAs of CSB transfected cell lines (Fig. 2 A, from CSBR946A). The efficiency of CSBexpression was examined by quantitative RT-PCR. The ratios of CSB transcript to 18 S internal standard were similar in all CSBtransfected cell lines (data not shown). Similar levels of the CSB protein were detected by immunoblot analysis in extracts from theCSB transfected cell lines (Fig. 2 B). No band corresponding to the CSB protein was detected in the CSBnull cell line (Fig. 2 B). These data showed that the intact CSB protein was expressed in all CSB transfected cell lines. Because UV sensitivity is a typical characteristic of CSBnull cell lines and because we have previously reported thatCSB null cell lines are also sensitive to 4-NQO (27Brosh R.M.J. Balajee A.S. Selzer R.R. Sunesen M. De Santis L.P. Bohr V.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3583-3594Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), allCSB transfected cell lines were tested for sensitivity to those two agents by clonogenic assay. The typical survival curves are presented in Fig. 3. These data are from the CSB transfected cell lines containing a point mutation in motif VI, CSBR946A. Cells with mutations in motifs V and VI of the putative helicase domain were unable to complement the UV and 4-NQO sensitivity in comparison with wild type CSB. The helicase motif Ia and III mutants demonstrated an intermediary level of UV and 4-NQO sensitivity. The second putative NTB domain mutant showed UV and 4-NQO resistances equivalent to that of wild type CS-B cell line.3 The colony forming ability of CSB transfected cell lines after γ-radiation is shown in Fig.4. CSB null cells were the most sensitive to γ-radiation. The AUC of CSB null cells was 62% of that of wild type cell. CSBQ942E and CSBR946A (motif VI mutants) were unable to complement the γ-radiation sensitivity ofCSB null cells. AUCs of motif VI mutants were ∼68% of that of wild type cells and were similar to that ofCSB null cells. CSBT912V and CSBT912/913V (motif V mutants) partially complemented the γ-radiation sensitivity of CSBnull cells. AUCs of the motif V mutants were 84% of the wild type cell. The motif Ia mutant, CSBP573A, the motif III mutant, CSBQ678E, and the second putative NTB mutant, CSBK1137Q, demonstrated γ-radiation resistance equivalent to that of wild type cells. A higher dose of γ-radiation (3 Gy) led to larger survival differences between wild type cells and motif VI mutants. The 8-OH-Gua incision activities in WCEs from various transfected CS-B cell lines are shown in Fig.5 A, and the results from 4 independent experiments are summarized in Fig. 5 B. We found reduced 8-OH-Gua incision activity in WCEs from CSB null cells (∼33% of that of CSBWT, p < 0.05), from motif VI mutants (CSBQ942E and CSBR946A, ∼50% of that of CSBWT,p < 0.05), and from motif V mutants (CSBT912V and CSBT912/913V, ∼76% of that of CSBWT, p < 0.05). The 8-OH-Gua incision activity in WCEs from the motif Ia mutant (CSBP573A), motif III mutant (CSBQ678E), and the second putative NTB mutant (CSBK1137Q) were equivalent to that of wild type CSB. A time course experiment further substantiates this difference. The relative incision activities of 8-OH-Gua among the transfected cell lines (CSB WT>mutants>CSB PC3.1) were similar at all time points. The time course curves of the most 8-OH-Gua incision-deficient cell lines are presented in Fig. 5 C. Reduced 8-OH-dGuo incision in CSBQ942E and CSB PC3.1 was observed at all time points analyzed. The largest differences were at 3 h when the reaction was close to saturation. The in vitro 8-OH-Gua incision activities of WCEs from theCSB transfected cell lines were then compared with their individual in vivo γ-radiation survival (Fig.6). This analysis showed a strong correlation between the cellular resistance to radiation (AUC from the survival curve of individual cell line) and the ability to incise 8-OH-Gua (percentage of incision). The motif contribution to 8-OH-Gua glycosylase/apurinic lyase activities paralleled the γ-radiation resistance with a good correlation (r = 0.98,p < 0.05) (Fig. 6). Thus, the defect in 8-OH-Gua incision correlates with an increased sensitivity to γ-radiation. To determine whether the BER defect was general or limited to the removal of 8-OH-Gua, we assayed for the incision of two lesions recognized by other glycosylases. There were no apparent differences among the cell lines in incision activities of either 5-OH-Cyt or uracil in oligonucleotide duplex (Figs.7 A and8 A). The cell lines with the most 8-OH-Gua incision deficiency (CSBQ942E and CSBPC3.1) appeared to have normal 5-OH-Cyt and uracil incision at all tested time points (Figs. 7 B and 8 B). Incision activities of both 5-OH-Cyt and uracil were close to saturation at 60 min. Thus, the BER deficiency in the transfected CS cell extracts appeared to be specific for certain damage(s). Incidentally, the incision activities of 5-OH-Cyt and uracil were both higher than that of 8-OH-Gua in all WCEs. Also, the identical level of the incision activities of 5-OH-Cyt and uracil in various cellular extracts suggested that the cell extracts all functioned proficiently and similarly with regards to DNA repair incision.Figure 8The glycosylase/apurinic lyase activities (incision) of uracil in WCEs from various CSBtransfected cell lines.

While Ca2+ influx through NMDARs plays a critical role in synaptic plasticity, direct actions of NMDAR-mediated Ca2+ influx on neuronal excitability have not been well established. Here we show that Ca2+ influx through NMDARs is directly coupled to activation of BK-type Ca2+-activated K+ channels in outside-out membrane patches from rat olfactory bulb granule cells. Repetitive stimulation of glutamatergic synapses in olfactory bulb slices evokes a slow inhibitory postsynaptic current (IPSC) in granule cells that requires both NMDARs and BK channels. The slow IPSC is enhanced by glutamate uptake blockers, suggesting that extrasynaptic NMDARs underlie the response. These findings reveal a novel inhibitory action of extrasynaptic NMDARs in the brain."

https://openalex.org/W1972307586,"Several effects of the proinflammatory cytokine, interleukin-1β (IL-1β), have been described in the central nervous system, and one area of the brain where marked changes have been reported is the hippocampus. Among these changes are an IL-1β-induced inhibition of long term potentiation (LTP) in perforant path-granule cell synapses and an attenuation of glutamate release in synaptosomes prepared from the hippocampus. Evidence suggests that, at least in circulating cells, the anti-inflammatory cytokine, IL-10, antagonizes certain effects of IL-1. We investigated the effect of IL-10 on IL-1β-induced inhibition of LTP and glutamate release. The evidence presented indicates that IL-1β stimulates the stress-activated protein kinase, c-Jun-activated protein kinase (JNK), and IL-1 receptor-associated kinase, which may explain its inhibitory effect on release and LTP, and that IL-10 reversed the IL-1β-induced stimulation of JNK activity and inhibition of release and LTP. We observed that IL-10 abrogated the stimulatory effect of IL-1β on superoxide dismutase activity and reactive oxygen species production, whereas the H2O2-induced inhibition of LTP was also blocked by IL-10. We present evidence that suggests that the action of IL-10 may be mediated by its ability to induce shedding of the IL-1 type I receptor.

These effects include modulation of thermoregulation, sleep, and appetite, which are perhaps consistent with the relatively high expression of the signal-generating IL-1 type 1 receptors (IL-1R1) in hypothalamus (1Lechan R.M.

The inhibitory effects of IL-1β in hippocampus have been linked with stimulation of the stress-activated kinases, p38 and JNK (14Vereker E. O'Donnell E. Lynch M.A. J.

Evidence suggests that activation of IL-1 receptor-activated kinase (IRAK) is closely linked with JNK activation (21O'Neill L.A.J. Greene C. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1998; 63: 650-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). Among the documented consequences of enhanced activity of JNK and/or p38 in some cells are growth arrest and deterioration of cell function or even cell death (22Park D.S. Stefanis L. Yan C.Y.I.

In contrast to the proinflammatory effects of IL-1β, IL-10 has been shown to possess anti-inflammatory properties. Like IL-1β, IL-10 was originally identified as a product of certain cells of the immune system, i.e. T helper cells, B cells, monocytes, and macrophages (24Fiorentino D.F. Bond M.W. Mosmann T.R. J. Exp. Med. 1989; 170: 2081-2095Crossref PubMed Scopus (2456) Google Scholar, 25Moore K.W. O'Garra A. DeWall Malefyt R. Vieira O. Mosmann T.R. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1993; 11: 165-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (2361) Google Scholar), although more recently it has been suggested that IL-10 is produced by cells in the hypothalamus and pituitary (26Rady P.L. Smith E.M. Cadet O. Opp M.R. Tyring S.K. Huges Jr., T.K. Cell. Mol. Neurobiol. 1995; 15: 289-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). IL-10 is co-released with IL-1β following injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS (27Durez P. Abramowicz D. Gerard C. Van Mechelen M. Amraoui Z. Dubois C. Leo O. Velu T. Goldman M. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 177: 551-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 28Van der Poll T. Jansen J. Levi M. Ten Cate H. Ten Cate J.W. Van Deventer J.H. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 1985-1988Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar)), but it has been shown to inhibit the production of IL-1β and TNFα in LPS-activated macrophages (24Fiorentino D.F. Bond M.W. Mosmann T.R. J. Exp. Med. 1989; 170: 2081-2095Crossref PubMed Scopus (2456) Google Scholar). IL-10 has also been shown to reverse the IL-1-induced fever that follows LPS injection (29Leon L.R. Kozak W. Kluger M.J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1998; 856: 69-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), whereas IL-1β induces slow wave sleep (30Shoham S. Davenne S. Cady A.B. Dinarello C.A. Krueger J.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1987; 253: R142-R149PubMed Google Scholar), IL-10 reduces sleep (31Opp M.R. Smith E.M. Hughes T.K. J. Neuroimmunol. 1995; 60: 165-168Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). At the level of the hippocampus, it has been shown that recovery following traumatic brain injury was improved by treatment with IL-10, and this was associated with decreased concentration of IL-1 in hippocampus (32Knoblach S.M. Faden A.I. Exp. Neurol. 1998; 153: 143-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). The evidence therefore indicates that IL-10 inhibits certain actions of IL-1β, in some cases by inhibiting IL-1β production and/or release. In an effort to examine this question further, we set out to establish whether IL-10 might antagonize the inhibitory effect of IL-1β on synaptic function in the hippocampus. The data indicate that IL-10 abrogates the IL-1β-induced inhibition of glutamate release and LTP and its stimulatory effect on JNK. We propose that this action of IL-10 may be mediated by its ability to prevent reactive oxygen species production by IL-1β. Male Wistar rats (BioResources Unit, Trinity College, Dublin, Ireland) were used in these experiments. Animals were housed in groups of 4–6 under a 12-h light schedule; ambient temperature was controlled between 22 and 23 °C, and rats were maintained under veterinary supervision. The activities of ERK (33McGahon B. Maguire C. Kelly A. Lynch M.A. Neuroscience. 1999; 90: 1167-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and JNK (16O'Donnell E. Vereker E. Lynch M.A. Eur. J Neurosci. 2000; 12: 345-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) were analyzed in P2 preparations obtained from dentate gyrus. Tissue samples were equalized for protein concentration (34Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar) and diluted so that the same concentration of protein (1 mg/ml) was loaded onto each lane. In experiments in which the effect of vasoactive intestinal protein (VIP) was assessed, P2 preparations were made in the presence of VIP (1 μm) allowing incorporation of the peptide into synaptosomes before membranes resealed. In other experiments, samples (which were/were not prepared in the presence of VIP) were preincubated for 15 min in IL-1β (1 ng/ml), IL-10 (10 ng/ml), H2O2 (200 μm), or a combination of some of these agents; in all circumstances, control samples were incubated in vehicle (Krebs solution containing 1.8 mmCaCl2) only. In a separate series of experiments, synaptosomes were prepared from dentate gyrus of rats that were injected intracerebroventricularly with saline or IL-1β (3.5 ng/ml) or H2O2 (200 μm). Aliquots (10 μl, 1 mg/ml) were added to sample buffer (10 μl; Tris-HCl, 0.5 mm, pH 6.8; glycerol 10%; SDS, 10%; β-mercaptoethanol, 5%; bromphenol blue, 0.05% w/v), boiled for 5 min, and loaded onto gels (10% SDS for ERK; 12% for JNK). Proteins were separated by application of 30 mA constant current for 25–30 min, transferred onto nitrocellulose strips (225 mA for 75 min), and immunoblotted with the appropriate antibody. To assess ERK activity, proteins were immunoblotted overnight at 4 °C with an antibody specific for the phosphorylated form of ERK (Promega; 1:4,000 in phosphate-buffered saline/Tween (0.1% Tween 20; PBS-T) containing 2% non-fat dried milk). To assess JNK activity, proteins were immunoblotted with an antibody that specifically targets phosphorylated JNK (Santa Cruz Biotechnology; 1:2,000 in PBS-T (0.1% Tween 20) containing 2% non-fat dried milk) for 2 h at room temperature. To assess IRAK, proteins were immunoblotted with a rabbit polyclonal anti-IRAK-1 antibody (1:4,000 Tris-buffered saline/Tween (0.1% Tween 20 containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin) for 2 h at room temperature. In all cases, nitrocellulose strips were washed and incubated for 2 h at room temperature with secondary antibody (horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-rabbit antibody; 1:10,000 dilution (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in the case of ERK, horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-rabbit antibody; 1:1,000 dilution (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in the case of IRAK, and peroxidase-linked anti-mouse IgG; 1:2,000 dilution (Sigma) in the case of JNK). Protein complexes were visualized by ECL detection (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in the case of ERK and JNK and Supersignal (Pierce) in the case of IRAK. Immunoblots were exposed to film for 3–4 h in the case of ERK, overnight in the case of JNK, and 10 s in the case of IRAK and processed using a Fuji x-ray processor. Protein bands were quantitated by densitometric analysis. The impure synaptosomal preparation, P2, was prepared as described previously (35McGahon B. Lynch M.A. Neuroscience. 1996; 72: 847-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) and resuspended in oxygenated Krebs solution containing 2 mm CaCl2. Synaptosomes were preincubated for 15 min at 37 °C in oxygenated Krebs solution containing 2 mm CaCl2 or Krebs solution to which 1 ng/ml IL-1β, 10 ng/ml IL-10, or both were added. In some experiments, synaptosomes were prepared in the presence of VIP (1 μm) as described above and were subsequently incubated with or without IL-1β (1 ng/ml) or H2O2 (200 μm). Tissue samples were aliquoted onto Millipore filters (0.45 mm), rinsed under vacuum, and then incubated in 250 μl of oxygenated Krebs solution at 37 °C for 3 min in the presence or absence of 40 mm KCl. The filtrate was collected and stored at −80 °C for later analysis (36Ordronneau P. Abdullah L. Petruse P. J. Immunol. Methods. 1991; 142: 169-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Triplicate samples (50 μl) or glutamate standards (50 μl; 50 nm to 10 μmprepared in 100 mm Na2HPO4 buffer, pH 8.0) were added to glutaraldehyde-coated 96-well plates, incubated, and washed. Ethanolamine (250 μl; 0.1 m in 100 mm Na2HPO4 buffer) was used to bind any unreacted aldehydes, and donkey serum was used to block nonspecific binding. Antiglutamate antibody (raised in rabbit; 100 μl; 1:5,000 in PBS-T; Sigma) was added, incubated, washed, and reacted with secondary antibody (anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-linked antibody; 100 μl; 1:10,000 in PBS-T; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). 3,3′,5,5′-Tetramethylbenzidine liquid substrate was added as chromogen; samples were incubated for exactly 60 min at room temperature, and H2SO4 (4 m; 50 μl) was added to stop the reaction. Optical densities were determined at 450 nm using a multiwell plate reader, and values were calculated with reference to the standard curve, corrected for protein (34Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar) and expressed as μmol of glutamate/mg of protein. Samples (dentate gyrus synaptosomes), which were preincubated for 20 min at 37 °C in IL-1β (1 ng/ml), IL-10 (10 ng/ml), or both, were assessed for IL-1R1 expression by gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting. Following incubation, samples underwent one freeze-thaw cycle and were centrifuged (10,000 × g for 10 min). The supernatant was used to assess soluble IL-1R1, and the pellet, which was resuspended in Krebs solution containing 2 mmCaCl2, was used to assess membrane-associated IL-1R1. In both cases, samples were equalized for protein concentration, and then proteins were separated by application of 30 mA constant current for 25–30 min, transferred onto nitrocellulose strips (225 mA for 75 min), and blocked overnight at 4 °C in PBS-T containing 6% non-fat dried milk. After appropriate washing (5 times 10-min washes in PBS-T), membranes were incubated in the primary antibody (rabbit anti-rat IL-1R1 IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology; 1:1,000 in PBS-T containing 2% non-fat dried milk)) for 45 min at room temperature and 45 min at 37 °C, washed (4 times 10-min washes in PBS-T), incubated in the secondary antibody (horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-rabbit, 1:2,000 in PBS-T containing 2% non-fat milk) for 45 min at room temperature and 45 min at 37 °C, and washed. Protein complexes were visualized by ECL detection (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) by exposing immunoblots to film for overnight at 4 °C and processed using a Fuji x-ray processor. Protein bands were quantitated by densitometric analysis. Rats were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of urethane (1.5 g/kg intraperitoneal); the absence of a pedal reflex was considered to be an indicator of deep anesthesia. LTP was induced unilaterally in perforant path-granule cell synapses as described previously (12Murray C. Lynch M.A. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 2974-2981Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Murray C. Lynch M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12161-12168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Briefly, a bipolar stimulating electrode and an unpopular recording were stereotaxically positioned in the perforant path (4.4 mm lateral to λ) and dorsal cell body region of the dentate gyrus (2.5 mm lateral and 3.9 mm posterior to Bregma), respectively. Rats were injected intracerebroventricularly (2.5 mm posterior, and 0.5 mm lateral, to Bregma) with saline, IL-1β (3.5 ng/ml) alone, or together with IL-10 (35 ng/ml or 1 μg/ml) or with H2O2 (200 μm) alone, or together with IL-10 (1 μg/ml); injection volume was 5 μl in all cases. Test shocks were given at 30-s intervals and recorded for 10 min before and 40 min after tetanic stimulation (3 trains of stimuli; 250 Hz for 200 ms; 30 s intertrain interval). Tetanic stimulation was delivered 40 min after injection. The formation of reactive oxygen species was assessed by analyzing formation of the highly fluorescent 2′,7-dichlorofluorescein from the non-fluorescent probe, 2′7′-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (Molecular Probes (37Lebel C.P. Bondy S.C. Neurochem. Int. 1990; 17: 435-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar)). The synaptosomal pellet, P2, was prepared from hippocampus and resuspended in 1 ml of ice-cold 40 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.4. Samples were incubated at 37 °C for 15 min in the presence of 2′7′-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (10 μl; final concentration 5 μm; from a stock solution of 500 μm in methanol) to which IL-1β (1 μg/ml) and/or IL-10 (10 ng/ml) was added. To terminate the reaction, the dye-loaded synaptosomes were centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 8 min. The pellet was resuspended in 3 ml of ice-cold 40 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.4. Fluorescence was monitored at a constant temperature of 37 °C immediately before stimulation with IL-1β (1 ng/ml) and 15 min post-stimulation, at 488 nm excitation (bandwidth 5 nm), and 525 nm emission (bandwidth 20 nm). Reactive oxygen species formation was quantified from a standard curve of 2′,7-dichlorofluorescein in methanol (range 0.05 to 1 μm). Protein concentration was determined (34Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar), and the results were expressed as nmol/mg protein/min. Superoxide dismutase activity was determined according to the method described previously (38Spitz D.R. Oberley L.W. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 179: 8-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar). Briefly, hippocampal slices were homogenized in Krebs solution containing CaCl2 and centrifuged at 15,000 for 10 min. Aliquots (800 μl) of incubation buffer (50 mmpotassium buffer (pH 7.8) containing 1.8 mm xanthine, 2.24 mm nitro blue tetrazolium, 40 units of catalase, 7 μl/ml xanthine oxidase, and 1.33 mm diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid) were added to samples of supernatant (100 μl) at different dilutions (1:2, 1:5, 1:10, 1:20, 1:50, and 1:100) and analyzed by UV spectroscopy at 560 nm. In some experiments, slices were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in IL-1β (100 pg/ml) in the presence/absence of IL-10 (10 ng/ml) to analyze the effect of the cytokines on superoxide dismutase activity. Enzyme activity was assessed as the rate of reduction of nitro blue tetrazolium, which was inhibited with increasing concentrations of protein. One unit of activity was defined as the amount of protein necessary to decrease the rate of the reduction of nitro blue tetrazolium by 50%. Fig. 1 A shows that IL-1β (1 ng/ml) increased JNK activity as indicated by an increase in the phosphorylated form of JNK; this effect is demonstrated in one sample immunoblot and also in the mean data obtained from seven experiments that indicate a statistically significant effect of IL-1β (p < 0.05; Student's t test for paired means). IL-10 reversed the stimulatory effect of IL-1β on JNK activity. In contrast to its effect on JNK, neither IL-1β alone nor in combination with IL-10 affected ERK phosphorylation (Fig.1 B). Data from previous experiments indicated that IL-1β inhibited KCl-stimulated [3H]glutamate release in hippocampus (7Murray C.A. McGahon B. McBennett S. Lynch M. Neurobiol. Aging. 1997; 18: 343-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) and that increased JNK activity was coupled with decreased endogenous glutamate release (14Vereker E. O'Donnell E. Lynch M.A. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 6811-6819Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16O'Donnell E. Vereker E. Lynch M.A. Eur. J Neurosci. 2000; 12: 345-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar); therefore, we analyzed the effect of IL-1β (1 ng/ml) alone and in the presence of IL-10 (10 ng/ml) on endogenous glutamate release. Fig. 1 C indicates that although incubation of hippocampal synaptosomes in the presence of 40 mm KCl significantly enhanced glutamate release (**,p < 0.01; ANOVA), this effect was blocked when IL-1β was incubated in the incubation medium. The data also indicate that unstimulated release was decreased by IL-1β (+, p < 0.05; ANOVA). IL-10 completely abrogated the effects of IL-1β so that both unstimulated and KCl-stimulated release were similar to values observed under control conditions. Because JNK activation is reported to be closely coupled with IRAK phosphorylation in certain cell types (21O'Neill L.A.J. Greene C. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1998; 63: 650-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar), we addressed the question of a similar coupling in hippocampus and reported that, although IL-1β significantly increases the 100-kDa phosphorylated form of IRAK (Fig. 1 D; p < 0.05; ANOVA), IL-10 inhibits this IL-1β-associated effect. When the 80-kDa unphosphorylated form of IRAK was assessed, no significant change with IL-1β, IL-10, or the combination of both was observed (data not shown); however, analysis of the ratio of 100-kDa IRAK to 80-kDa IRAK revealed a significant increase with IL-1β which was suppressed by IL-10 (Fig. 1 E; p < 0.05; ANOVA). The data are consistent with the idea that JNK activation by IL-1β and the inhibition of this effect by IL-10 is linked with, and may be a consequence of, IRAK activation. The inhibitory effect of IL-1β on glutamate release represents one factor that might contribute to its inhibitory effect on LTP. It might be argued that, if this is the case, the effect of IL-1β on LTP may also be suppressed by IL-10. Fig. 2indicates that, in saline-treated rats, there was an immediate increase in the population epsp slope following tetanic stimulation and that this increase persisted for the duration of the experiment. The mean percentage change (± S.E.) in the last 5 min of the experiment was 140.14 ± 2.47 (compared with the value in the 5 min prior to the tetanus). Intracerebroventricular injection of IL-1β inhibited both the early and later components of LTP; in this group, the mean percentage change in population epsp slope in the last 5 min of the experiment was 96.44 ± 1.30 (Fig. 2 B;p < 0.001; ANOVA). IL-10 attenuated the effect of IL-1β in a dose-dependent manner; thus the mean percentage changes in population epsp slope (± S.E.) in the last 5 min of the experiment were 105.5 ± 0.75 and 117.3 ± 0.91, respectively, in rats treated with IL-1β and 35 ng/ml IL-10 and in rats treated with IL-1β and 1 μg/ml IL-10; these values were significantly different from the value in IL-1β-treated rats (p < 0.001; ANOVA). However, the data also show that IL-10 exerted an inhibitory effect on LTP; the mean percentage change in the last 5 min of the experiment in IL-10-treated rats was 113.1 ± 0.37, which was significantly lower than that in saline-treated controls (p < 0.001; ANOVA). We considered that one mechanism by which IL-10 might act to inhibit the effect of IL-1β was by modulating expression of IL-1R1. Fig. 3 indicates that incubation of tissue in the presence of IL-10 significantly decreased expression of IL-1R1 in membrane fractions (p < 0.05; Student'st test for paired means) and significantly increased its expression in cytosolic fractions (p < 0.05; Student's t test for paired means). Because previous data indicated that IL-1β increased reactive oxygen species production in hippocampus (12Murray C. Lynch M.A. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 2974-2981Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Murray C. Lynch M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12161-12168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), it seemed reasonable to propose that IL-10 might antagonize this effect. Fig.4 A indicates that IL-1β significantly increased reactive oxygen species accumulation (p < 0.05; Student's t test for paired values), and this was reversed by co-incubation in the presence of IL-10 (10 ng/ml). In parallel, IL-1β significantly increased superoxide dismutase activity (p < 0.05; Student'st test for paired values; Fig. 4 B), and this effect was also reversed by IL-10, although it is acknowledged that the S.E. values in this case are rather large. We report that H2O2 mimicked the stimulatory effect of IL-1β on JNK; thus intracerebroventricular injection of IL-1β (3.5 ng/ml; Fig.5 A) or H2O2 (200 μm; Fig. 5 C) increased JNK activity as shown by the sample immunoblots; analysis of the mean values obtained from densitometric analysis indicated a significant stimulatory effect of both agents (p < 0.05; Student's t test for paired values). These effects of IL-1β and H2O2 were mimicked in vitro; thus incubation of hippocampal tissue in the presence of IL-1β (Fig. 5 B) or H2O2 (Fig.5 D) increased JNK as indicated by the sample immunoblots; densitometric analysis revealed that these effects were statistically significant (p < 0.05; Student'st test for paired values). If IL-1β mediates its effects by increasing reactive oxygen species production, and if IL-10 inhibits the effect of IL-1β by antagonizing this, then the inhibitory effect of IL-1β on LTP should be mimicked by H2O2, which generates reactive oxygen species, and IL-10 should suppress this effect of H2O2. Fig.6 A indicates that LTP was induced and sustained in saline-treated rats but blocked in rats that received an intracerebroventricular injection of H2O2; the mean percentage changes in population epsp slope (± S.E.) in the last 5 min of the experiment (compared with the value in the 5 min prior to the tetanus) were 141.2 ± 0.81 and 102.4 ± 0.83 in saline-treated and H2O2-treated rats, respectively (Fig.6 B). Intracerebroventricular injection of IL-10 (1 μg/ml) reversed the inhibitory effect of H2O2, but values were not completely restored to control values; thus the mean percentage change in population epsp slope in the last 5 min of the experiment was 129.9 ± 1.58 (Fig. 6 B). Both IL-1β and H2O2 induced parallel changes in JNK activation and glutamate release, but confirmation of a causal relationship between the two measures requires assessment of the effect of a JNK inhibitor on IL-1β-induced inhibition of glutamate release. Although not specific, VIP has been shown to inhibit JNK in some cells, and here we assessed the possibility that it might inhibit IL-1β- and H2O2-induced JNK activation in hippocampus. Fig. 7, A and C,shows sample immunoblot in which the stimulatory effect of IL-1β (Fig. 7 A) and H2O2 (Fig.7 C) on JNK phosphorylation are clearly shown (comparelanes 1 and 2; control and IL-1β- or H2O2-treated, respectively); these sample immunoblots also show that VIP inhibited the IL-1β- and H2O2-induced effects (lane 4), whereas VIP alone exerted no marked effect (lane 3)."

The visual system has provided a useful model for understanding the role of these cues in shaping the precise connections from the neural retina to the brain. Here, we demonstrate that two essential genes in the Reelin signaling pathway function during the patterning of synaptic connectivity in the retina. Physiological studies of mice deficient in either reelin or disabled-1 reveal an attenuation of rod-driven retinal responses. This defect is associated with a decrease in rod bipolar cell density and an abnormal distribution of processes in the inner plexiform layer. These results imply that, in addition to its essential role during neuronal migration, the Reelin pathway contributes to the formation of neuronal circuits in the central nervous system."
https://openalex.org/W2141776622,"Becker et al. (1) presented geochemical evidence that suggests that the largest mass extinction in Earth history, at the Permian-Triassic boundary (PTB) 250 million years ago (Ma), coincided with an extraterrestrial impact comparable in size to the one that likely caused the end-Cretaceous extinctions 65 Ma (2). Although Becker et al. analyzed material from sections in Hungary, Japan, and China, the Hungarian section yielded no extraterrestrial signature, and their identification of the PTB in the Japanese section is questioned in the accompanying comment by Isozaki (below). Thus, only their analyses of the Chinese section provide hitherto uncontested evidence for an impact at the boundary—in the form of data on the abundance and composition of fullerenes in the “boundary clay,” a volcanic ash layer called Bed 25 at Meishan, China (3). Although fullerenes may be purely terrestrial [see, e.g., (4)], Becker et al. report that the fullerenes from the Meishan ash carry extraterrestrial noble gases in the cage structure, rich in ^(3)He and with distinctive ^(3)He/^(36)Ar and ^(40)Ar/^(36)Ar ratios, and that this signature therefore derived from a bolide impact. Here, we report that we are able to detect fullerene-hosted extraterrestrial ^(3)He neither in aliquots of the same Meishan material analyzed by Beckeret al., nor any in samples of a second Chinese PTB section, and that we thus find no evidence for an impact."
https://openalex.org/W2020262557,"Activation of protein kinase C (PKC) triggers cellular signals that inhibit Fas/CD95-induced cell death in Jurkat T-cells by poorly defined mechanisms. Previously, we have shown that one effect of PKC on Fas/CD95-dependent cell death occurs through inhibition of cell shrinkage and K+ efflux (Gómez-Angelats, M., Bortner, C. D., and Cidlowski, J. A. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275, 19609–19619). Here we report that PKC alters Fas/CD95 signaling from the plasma membrane to the activation of caspases by exerting a profound action on survival/cell death decisions. Specific activation of PKC with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate or bryostatin-1 induced translocation of PKC from the cytosol to the membrane and effectively inhibited cell shrinkage and cell death triggered by anti-Fas antibody in Jurkat cells. In contrast, inhibition of classical PKC isotypes with Gö6976 exacerbated the effect of Fas activation on both apoptotic volume decrease and cell death. PKC activation/inhibition did not affect anti-Fas antibody binding to the cell surface, intracellular levels of FADD (Fas-associated protein with deathdomain), or c-FLIP (cellular FLICE-likeinhibitory protein) expression. However, processing/activation of both caspase-8 and caspase-3 and BID cleavage were markedly blocked upon PKC activation and, conversely, were augmented during PKC inhibition, suggesting a role for PKC upstream of caspase-8 processing and activation. Analysis of death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) formation was carried out to examine the influence of PKC on recruitment of both FADD and procaspase-8 to the Fas receptor. PKC activation blocked FADD recruitment and caspase-8 activation and thus DISC formation in both type I and II cells. In contrast, inhibition of classical PKCs promoted the opposite effect on the Fas pathway by rapidly increasing FADD recruitment, caspase-8 activation, and DISC formation. Together, these data show that PKC finely modulates Fas/CD95 signaling by altering the efficiency of DISC formation.

Apoptosis is a cell death process that plays a key role in the regulation of the immune system, and excessive apoptosis has been shown to occur in diseases such as AIDS, in which there is a massive removal of CD4+ helper T-cells. In contrast, defective apoptosis can have detrimental effects on the regulation of the immune response or on the emergence of hyperplasia among immune system cell lineages (1Krammer P.H. Nature. 2000; 407: 789-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (1405) Google Scholar). Fas/CD95 is a member of tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily that is highly expressed in the plasma membrane of a variety of cell types, including lymphoid cells. Apoptosis triggered by activation of members of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily is a critical process for the maintenance of T- and B-cell homeostasis and thus essential for regulation of immune responses. Specifically, removal of activated and self-reactive T- and B-lymphocytes has been shown to require activation of Fas/CD95 (1Krammer P.H. Nature. 2000; 407: 789-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (1405) Google Scholar). Activation of Fas/CD95 upon ligation with its natural ligand, the cytokine FasL (Fasligand), or by agonistic antibodies such as CH-11 initiates a rapid signaling process that induces cells to undergo apoptosis. Binding of FasL or anti-Fas antibody to Fas/CD95 results in rapid recruitment of the adaptor protein FADD (Fas-associated protein with deathdomain, also called Mort-1) to the receptor through interaction of its C-terminal death domain with the cytosolic death domain of the receptor (2Boldin M.P.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5579-5588Crossref PubMed Scopus (1787) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence have demonstrated that this recruitment plays a pivotal role in the cell death pathway. For example, FADD-deficient T-cells (5Juo P. Woo M.S. Kuo C.J. Signorelli P. Biemann H.P. Hannun Y.A. Blenis J. Cell Growth Differ. 1999; 10: 797-804PubMed Google Scholar) or lymphoid cells transfected with dominant-negative FADD have an abrogated Fas signaling cascade (6Chinnaiyan A.M. Tepper C.G. Seldin M.F.

Similarly, FADD−/− mice have been shown to display defects in apoptotic pathways in the immune system (7Zhang J. Cado D. Chen A. Kabra N.H. Winoto A. Nature. 1998; 392: 296-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar). The N terminus of FADD contains a death effector domain that, upon activation of the Fas receptor, recruits cytosolic procaspase-8 through the death effector domains located in the N-terminal domain of the proenzyme (8Muzio M. Chinnaiyan A.M. Kischkel F.C. O'Rourke K. Shevchenko A. Ni J. Scaffidi C. Bretz J.D. Zhang M. Gentz R. Mann M. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. Dixit V.M. Cell. 1996; 85: 817-827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2741) Google Scholar). The process of Fas/CD95 receptor interaction with FADD and procaspase-8 was termed death-inducing signaling complex (DISC)1 formation by Kischkelet al. (4Kischkel F.C. Hellbardt S. Behrmann I. Germer M. Pawlita M. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5579-5588Crossref PubMed Scopus (1787) Google Scholar). Immediately upon recruitment, procaspase-8 becomes autoproteolytically cleaved to an active dimer in a process presumably induced by physical proximity of procaspase-8 molecules (9Muzio M.

Active caspase-8 initiates amplification of the death cascade through cleavage and activation of both downstream caspases (10Thornberry N.A. Lazebnik Y. Science. 1998; 281: 1312-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (6159) Google Scholar) and pro-apoptotic molecules such as BID (11Li H. Zhu H. Xu C.J. Yuan J.

Cell. 1998; 94: 481-490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3080) Google Scholar). Resistance to Fas/CD95-induced cell death in immune system cells can result in the generation of severe pathologies such as autoimmunity and hematological malignancies (2Boldin M.P. Varfolomeev E.E.

In many instances, resistance to apoptosis arises from constitutive or up-regulated expression of an array of proteins and signaling molecules that counteract death signals initiated by activation of the Fas/CD95 receptor. In this context, PKC activation has been shown to inhibit Fas/CD95-induced apoptosis of Jurkat T-cells (13Mizuno K. Noda K. Araki T. Imaoka T. Kobayashi Y. Akita Y. Shimonaka M. Kishi S. Ohno S. Eur.

The PKC family is composed of at least 12 broadly expressed serine/threonine kinase isotypes that have been subdivided in three subgroups based on their regulation (17Mellor H. Parker P.J. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 281-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (1359) Google Scholar, 18Mochly-Rosen D. Gordon A.S. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 35-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). The classical PKCs include the α, βI, βII, and γ isotypes and require Ca2+ and diacylglycerol for maximal activation. The novel PKCs include the δ, ε, θ, and η isotypes and are Ca2+-independent, but require diacylglycerol mobilization for their activation. The atypical group is represented by the ζ, ι, and λ isotypes and are both Ca2+- and diacylglycerol-independent. Finally, PKCμ and protein kinase D (human and mouse isoforms, respectively) constitute their own group due to their distinct structure (19Rozengurt E. Sinnett-Smith J. Van Lint J. Valverde A.M. Mutat. Res. 1995; 333: 153-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 20Van Lint J.V. Sinnett-Smith J. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1455-1461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Each PKC isotype is the expression product of an individual gene, except for βI and βII, which arise from alternative RNA splicing. PKCs are expressed in a tissue-specific manner and become activated in response to specific hormonal and growth factor stimuli. PKC expression in T-cells includes the α, δ, ε, θ, and ζ isotypes, which exhibit different degrees of activation depending on the nature of the stimulus (21Tsutsumi A. Kubo M. Fujii H. Freire-Moar J.

Blood. 2000; 95: 3478-3482Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). FLIP contains two N-terminal death effector domain motifs and has been found to be expressed as two different spliced variants designated as short and long FLIP (FLIPSand FLIPL, respectively) (25Irmler M. Thome M. Hahne M. Schneider P. Hofmann K. Steiner V. Bodmer J.L. Schroter M. Burns K. Mattmann C. Rimoldi D. French L.E. Tschopp J.

Both molecules are structurally homologous, except that the long form of FLIP has a proteolytic caspase-8-like domain that lacks the conserved cysteine residue present in all caspases and that is required for catalytic protease activity (30Hu S. Vincenz C. Ni J. Gentz R. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17255-17257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). A number of studies support the notion that both forms of FLIP can prevent Fas/CD95-mediated apoptosis by interacting with either FADD and/or procaspase-8 (25Irmler M. Thome M. Hahne M. Schneider P.

Nature. 1997; 386: 517-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (1144) Google Scholar). Because repression of the Fas/CD95 pathway can be a source of both disease and therapeutic resistance (1Krammer P.H. Nature. 2000; 407: 789-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (1405) Google Scholar, 31Kitada S. Zapata J.M. Andreeff M. Reed J.C. Br. J. Haematol. 1999; 106: 995-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), we investigated the potential mechanism regulated by PKC that triggers resistance to Fas-induced cell death in Jurkat cells. In this study, we show a PKC-dependent molecular mechanism that controls Fas/CD95-induced apoptosis. Our results demonstrate that inhibition of Fas/CD95-induced apoptosis in Jurkat cells by PKC activation occurs through a rapid and FLIP-independent suppression of FADD recruitment to Fas/CD95 and diminished DISC formation. In contrast, inhibition of classical PKC isotypes signals rapid enhancement of DISC formation and subsequent propagation of the Fas/CD95 death cascade. Jurkat T-cells were cultured at 37 °C in a 7% CO2 atmosphere in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 4 mm glutamine, 75 units/ml streptomycin, and 100 units/ml penicillin. The phorbol esters 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (PMA) and 4α-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (Sigma), Gö6976 (Calbiochem), and bryostatin-1 (BIOMOL Research Labs Inc., Plymouth Meeting, PA) were freshly dissolved in Me2SO (final [Me2SO] never exceeded 0.1% in the culture medium) and stored at −20 °C for up to 1 month. In all cases, cells were preincubated in the presence of the different PKC modulators (20 nm PMA, 10 nm bryostatin-1, or 2.5 μm Gö6976) for 30 min, subsequently treated with anti-human Fas (anti-Fas) IgM antibody CH-11 (Kamiya Biomedical Co., Seattle, WA), and incubated until sample processing. Mouse monoclonal anti-human PKCα IgG2b antibody was purchased from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Mouse monoclonal anti-actin IgG1 antibody was from Chemicon International, Inc. (Temecula, CA). Mouse monoclonal anti-human caspase-3 and anti-human caspase-8 IgG1 antibodies were from Calbiochem. Mouse monoclonal anti-human FADD IgG1 and rabbit polyclonal anti-human BID antibodies were purchased from Transduction Laboratories and BIOSOURCE (San Diego, CA), respectively. Monoclonal anti-Fas/CD95 IgG1 antibody (B-10) was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Monoclonal anti-human c-FLIPS/L IgG2a antibody was from Apotech, and rabbit polyclonal anti-FLIPS/L antibody (H-202) was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary anti-mouse IgG and anti-rabbit IgG antibodies were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-rat IgG1 antibody was from Southern Biotechnology (Birmingham, AL). The rest of the reagents were purchased from either Sigma or Pierce unless indicated. Changes in cell volume and plasma membrane integrity were assessed by flow cytometry analysis using a Becton Dickinson FACSort. 2 ml of cell suspension were used per sample prior to addition of the vital dye propidium iodide (10 μg/ml final concentration; Sigma). For cell volume analysis, 10,000 cells were examined for each sample by excitation with a 488-nm argon laser. Changes in cell size were examined on a forward light scatterversus side light scatter dot plot using CellQuest software as previously described (32Bortner C.D. Hughes Jr., F.M. Cidlowski J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32436-32442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). Since a decrease in forward scatter concomitant with an increase in side scatter in a given cell population is indicative of cell shrinkage, gates were drawn to analyze the percent of shrunken versus normal sized cells. For cell viability, forward scatter versus propidium iodide fluorescence (FL-3) dot plot histograms were used to quantify the percentage of cells with high propidium iodide fluorescence, which is a measure of plasma membrane integrity. In the control sample, a gate was drawn around the normal population and used to compare the percentage of viable (low propidium iodide) versus nonviable (high propidium iodide) cells for each condition. Expression of surface Fas receptor was determined with an anti-Fas antibody conjugated to FITC (FITC-labeled anti-IgG1 antibody APO-1-1, Kamiya Biomedical Co.). Jurkat cells (2 × 106 cells) were incubated in the presence or absence 20 nm PMA, 10 nmbryostatin-1, or 2.5 μm Gö6976 for 3 h and collected by centrifugation at 1500 × g for 5 min. Pelleted cells were washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), resuspended in 100 μl of ice-cold PBS containing nothing or 20 nm PMA, 10 nm bryostatin-1, or 2.5 μm Gö6976. 5 μl of FITC-labeled CD95 were then added to the cells while gently mixing the suspension. Cells were kept on ice for 30 min, and 1 ml of PBS was added prior to flow cytometry analysis of cells on FL-1 (488 nm excitation and 530 nm emission). Flow cytometry histograms were used to analyze the distribution of FITC-labeled CD95 fluorescence versus cell number under the different conditions. For subcellular fractionation studies, 2 × 107 Jurkat cells per treatment were preincubated for 30 min in the presence or absence of PMA, bryostatin-1, or Gö6976 and with or without anti-Fas antibody CH-11 for 15 min. Cells were collected by centrifugation at 1500 × g for 5 min; washed with PBS; and resuspended in 1 ml of buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mm EDTA, 0.3% β-mercaptoethanol, and a mixture of protease inhibitors (CompleteTM, Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Cells were homogenized by being passed 30 times through a 25-gauge needle and centrifuged at 280 × g for 10 min to precipitate nuclei. The supernatant was then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The resultant soluble supernatant (cytosolic fraction) was stored at −80 °C, and the residual pellet was resuspended in the same buffer supplemented with 1% Triton X-100, sonicated for 1 min, and stored at −80 °C as the membrane fraction. Prior to Western blot analysis, protein concentration was assayed by the method of Bradford using the Bio-Rad system, and all cell extracts were normalized to equal protein concentration. For crude Jurkat lysate preparation, cells were collected and washed with cold PBS. The cells were immediately placed on ice and resuspended for 20 min in lysis buffer (20 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5), 2 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.5% Triton X-100) containing protease inhibitors (CompleteTM). Cells were then disrupted with a 25-gauge needle and centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 15 min, and protein concentration was determined prior to protein normalization. 20–50 μg of protein/sample were equally diluted in Laemmli loading buffer supplemented with β-mercaptoethanol and denatured at 99 °C for 5 min, followed by 2 h of electrophoresis on 12 or 4–20% Tris/glycine gels (Novex, San Diego, CA) at 120 V. Gels were then electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell) at 42 V for 1.5 h and stained with Ponceau S to verify equal amounts of protein loading. Membranes were blocked in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) containing 0.05% Tween (Sigma) and 10% nonfat dry milk for 1 h. Antibodies were diluted in TBS containing 0.05% Tween and 1% dry milk, and membranes were blotted with the corresponding antibody for 1 h at room temperature. Blots were washed three times with TBS containing 0.05% Tween and 1% dry milk and incubated for 1 h with the corresponding horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibodies diluted 1:5000 in TBS containing 0.05% Tween and 0.5% milk. After three washes with TBS, membranes were visualized with the ECL chemiluminescence detection system and exposed to Hyperfilm ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). In some cases, blots were stripped with Re-BlotTM (Chemicon International, Inc.) and reprobed for actin expression. DISC formation analysis was carried out as previously described (33Scaffidi C. Kischkel F.C. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 322: 363-373Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, 1.5 × 107 cells suspended at a density of 5 × 106 cells/ml were pretreated with PKC modulators for 30 min. Cells were treated with or without 1 μg/ml anti-Fas antibody CH-11 (mouse IgM) and incubated at 37 °C for the indicated times. Cells were collected and pelleted at 4 °C, washed with ice-cold PBS, and resuspended in 1 ml of a phosphate-based immunoprecipitation buffer (20 mm Na+phosphate, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 0.5 mm Na3VO4, and 1% Triton X-100 (pH 7.2)) supplemented with protease inhibitors (CompleteTM). Protein from post-nuclear supernatants was normalized among all samples and used for immunoprecipitation of the Fas/CD95 receptor. Extracts from all control groups (Fas-untreated cell extracts) were supplemented with 1 μg of anti-Fas antibody CH-11, and all lysates were subsequently incubated at 4 °C overnight with 40 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads coated with rabbit anti-mouse IgM antibody. Beads were washed five times with 1 ml of cold immunoprecipitation buffer and resuspended in 30 μl of Laemmli buffer containing β-mercaptoethanol, and the denatured samples were run on 4–20% Tris/glycine gels. Western analyses were carried out as described above, and the blots were probed using monoclonal anti-human Fas/CD95 antibody and horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-mouse IgG1 antibody. Blots were stripped and reprobed with a mixture containing both anti-caspase-8 and anti-FADD antibodies, followed by exposure to horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-mouse IgG1 antibody. Occasionally, re-stripped blots were reprobed with rat monoclonal anti-human c-FLIPS/L IgG2a and horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-rat IgG1 antibodies. c-FLIPS/L was immunoprecipitated using rabbit polyclonal anti-FLIPS/L antibody. Briefly, cells were plated, treated, and processed as described for DISC analysis. Post-nuclear supernatants were precleared for 1 h at 4 °C with 4 μl of rabbit antiserum and with 25 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads. Precleared supernatants were first incubated overnight at 4 °C in the presence of 1 μg of rabbit anti-human c-FLIPS/L antibody and then with 25 μl of protein A-Sepharose for an additional hour. Beads were washed five times with 1 ml of cold immunoprecipitation buffer, and samples run as described above. Blots were then probed using rat monoclonal anti-human c-FLIPS/L IgG2a antibody. A pharmacological approach was first used to evaluate the modulation of apoptosis by PKC activation and inhibition. Jurkat cells were preincubated for 30 min in the presence or absence of the specific PKC modulators PMA (20 nm), bryostatin-1 (10 nm), and Gö6976 (2.5 μm) prior to addition of 50 ng/ml anti-Fas antibody CH-11 for 3 h. PMA is a tumor promoter phorbol ester recognized to be a general activator of PKC that rapidly induces general activation and translocation of PKC isotypes to the plasma membrane (34Kvanta A. Jondal M. Fredholm B.B. FEBS Lett. 1991; 283: 321-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Bryostatin-1 is a macrocyclic lactone that potently activates the diacylglycerol-sensitive classical and novel PKC subfamilies in lymphoid cells (35Jarvis W.D. Povirk L.F. Turner A.J. Traylor R.S. Gewirtz D.A. Pettit G.R. Grant S. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1994; 47: 839-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The efficacy of both PMA and bryostatin-1 in activating PKC was determined by examination of changes in the relative amount of PKCα in both particulate and cytosolic subcellular fractions induced by these compounds. After 30 min of PMA or bryostatin-1 treatment, the membrane fraction of Jurkat cells exhibited relative enrichment of PKCα (Fig.1 A), with parallel depletion of the isotype in the cytosolic fraction. This effect occurred in the absence or presence of anti-Fas antibody, indicating that both compounds effectively stimulated PKC and that anti-Fas antibody does not interfere with PKC stimulation. Gö6976, a bisindolylmaleimide (staurosporine-derived indolocarbazole) with selectivity for binding and inhibiting the catalytic subunit of PKC (36Way K.J. Chou E. King G.L. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2000; 21: 181-187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar), was chosen as a selective PKC inhibitor on the basis of previous reported effects on Fas-induced cell death (16Gómez-Angelats M. Bortner C.D. Cidlowski J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19609-19619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). This compound did not affect the PKC translocation pattern since it interacts with the catalytic subunit of the enzyme (37Martiny-Baron G. Kazanietz M.G. Mischak H. Blumberg P.M. Kochs G. Hug H. Marme D. Schachtele C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9194-9197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and thus inhibits PKC activity rather than affecting the activation/translocation process. Actin expression (Fig.1 A, lower panels) was used as an internal control in the experiments, revealing that the observed pattern of PKCα translocation was not a result of the fractionation procedure. After preincubation of Jurkat cells with PKC modulators, cell shrinkage, which is a defining feature of apoptosis (38Kerr J.F. Wyllie A.H. Currie A.R. Br. J. Cancer. 1972; 26: 239-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (12874) Google Scholar), was analyzed at 3 h after exposure to anti-Fas antibody. As shown in Fig. 1 B, treatment of Jurkat cells with anti-Fas antibody alone (50 ng/ml) resulted in a shift of the cell population to lower values of forward scatter and side scatter light, indicative of the loss of cell volume. However, PKC activation with PMA (20 nm) or bryostatin-1 (10 nm) inhibited the loss of cell volume triggered by anti-Fas antibody, whereas PKC inhibition with Gö6976 (2.5 μm) exacerbated the effect of anti-Fas antibody on cell shrinkage. Plasma membrane integrity (viability) was examined in parallel with forward scatter analyses, revealing that with this dose of anti-Fas antibody CH-11, the cell population remained viable after 3 h (data not shown). Given that Gö6976 has been reported to be highly selective for the PKCα and PKCβ isotypes (37Martiny-Baron G. Kazanietz M.G. Mischak H. Blumberg P.M. Kochs G. Hug H. Marme D. Schachtele C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9194-9197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), these results suggest that inhibition of the α and/or β isotype may likely be involved in altering the effectiveness of anti-Fas antibody in inducing cell shrinkage in Jurkat cells. Cell death analysis was carried out at a 18-h time point by examination of the ratio of propidium iodide-positive (nonviable) cells in the cell population. As shown in Fig. 1 C, treatment of cells with PMA or bryostatin-1 induced resistance to Fas-induced cell death after 18 h, whereas PKC inhibit"

The putative substrate-binding site is located near the end of the βA-strand with Asp-26 playing a critical catalytic role. In both subunits, an elongated hydrophobic tunnel is found, surrounded by four β-strands (βA-βB-βD-βC) and two helices (α2 and α3) and lined at the bottom with large residues Ile-62, Leu-137, Val-105, and His-103. The product distributions formed by the use of the I62A, V105A, and H103A mutants are similar to those observed for wild-type UPPs. Catalysis by the L137A UPPs, on the other hand, results in predominantly the formation of the C70 polymer rather than the C55 polymer. Ala-69 and Ala-143 are located near the top of the tunnel. In contrast to the A143V reaction, the C30intermediate is formed to a greater extent and is longer lived in the process catalyzed by the A69L mutant. These findings suggest that the small side chain of Ala-69 is required for rapid elongation to the C55 product, whereas the large hydrophobic side chain of Leu-137 is required to limit the elongation to the C55product. The roles of residues located on a flexible loop were investigated. The S71A, N74A, or R77A mutants displayed 25–200-fold decrease in k cat values. W75A showed an 8-fold increase of the FPP K m value, and 22–33-fold increases in the IPP K m values were observed for E81A and S71A. The loop may function to bridge the interaction of IPP with FPP, needed to initiate the condensation reaction and serve as a hinge to control the substrate binding and product release.

Suzuki M. Nishino T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 268: 14792-14797Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). By substituting this large residue with the smaller Ser, product synthesis was shifted from the production of C20 product to C25 and C30products (14Ohnuma S. Hirooka K. Hemmi H. Ishida C. Ohto C.

Replacing the active site aromatic residues Phe-112 and Phe-113 with smaller amino acids produced FPPs mutants that synthesize C20 geranyl pyrophosphate (F112A), C25geranylfarnesyl pyrophosphate (F113S), and longer products (F112A/F113S) (16Tarshis L.C.

Analysis of the F112A/F113S structure shows that it contains an enlarged active site that is possibly related to increased product size.On the other hand, Z-type isoprenyl-pyrophosphate synthases such as undecaprenyl-pyrophosphate synthase (UPPs) and dehydrodolichyl-pyrophosphate synthase catalyze the formation of long chain products ranging from C55 to C100 (17Quellhorst Jr., G.J.

UPPs, the subject of this paper, generates a C55product by catalyzing the chain elongation of farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) via sequential condensation reactions of eight IPP, which serves as a carrier in transporting lipid II across the membrane in bacterial cell wall biosynthesis (19Allen C.M. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 110: 281-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 20Robyt J.F. Essentials of Carbohydrate Chemistry. Springer-Verlag Inc., New York1998: 305-318Google Scholar). Despite close similarities in the chemistry catalyzed, no sequence homology exists betweenZ-type and E-type enzymes (21Shimizu N. Koyama T. Ogura K. J. Biol.

Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 483-492Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To understand better the Z-type enzyme catalysis, we have studied the reaction mechanism and kinetics of Escherichia coli UPPs (23Pan J.J. Chiou S.T. Liang P.H. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 10936-10942Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), and we show that some aspartate and glutamate residues may play a structural and catalytic role and that their mutations affect the enzyme activity and/or substrate binding (24Pan J.J. Yang L.W. Liang P.H. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 13856-13861Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Recently, the three-dimensional structure of UPPs from Micrococcus luteuswas solved by Fujihashi et al. (25Fujihashi M. Zhang Y.-W. Higuchi Y. Li X.-Y. Koyama T. Miki K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4337-4342Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), and it is completely different from those of E-type prenyltransferases. We report the structure of E. coli UPPs, which is similar to the structure of M. luteus UPPs except that two protein conformers were discovered for E. coli UPPs. The large amino acid residues Ile-62, Leu-137, Val-105, and His-103, occupying the bottom portion of an elongated hydrophobic tunnel from the structure ofE. coli UPPs were replaced with Ala using site-directed mutagenesis to study the mechanism of product chain length determination. In addition, two amino acid residues, Ala-69 and Ala-143, located near the top of the hydrophobic tunnel in E. coli UPPs, were substituted with Leu and Val, respectively, as seen in the Mycobacterium tuberculosis Z-type short chain FPPs (26Schulbach M.C. Brennan P.J. Crick D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22876-22881Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) to examine the possible formation of a short chain product. Furthermore, a flexible loop without observable electron densities of residues 72–83 was found in both UPPs structures. Mutagenesis studies of the M. luteus enzyme suggest that loop residues Asn-77 and Trp-78 are important for catalysis and FPP binding (27Fujikura K. Zhang Y.-W. Yoshizki T. Koyama T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2000; 128: 917-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). To address the role of this loop in E. coli UPPs, we generated the loop mutants S71A, E73A, N74A, W75A, R77A, and E81A and measured the impact of loop residue replacement on substrate binding and catalysis.

On the other hand, Z-type isoprenyl-pyrophosphate synthases such as undecaprenyl-pyrophosphate synthase (UPPs) and dehydrodolichyl-pyrophosphate synthase catalyze the formation of long chain products ranging from C55 to C100 (17Quellhorst Jr., G.J.

UPPs, the subject of this paper, generates a C55product by catalyzing the chain elongation of farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) via sequential condensation reactions of eight IPP, which serves as a carrier in transporting lipid II across the membrane in bacterial cell wall biosynthesis (19Allen C.M.

Despite close similarities in the chemistry catalyzed, no sequence homology exists betweenZ-type and E-type enzymes (21Shimizu N. Koyama T. Ogura K. J. Biol.

To understand better the Z-type enzyme catalysis, we have studied the reaction mechanism and kinetics of Escherichia coli UPPs (23Pan J.J. Chiou S.T. Liang P.H. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 10936-10942Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), and we show that some aspartate and glutamate residues may play a structural and catalytic role and that their mutations affect the enzyme activity and/or substrate binding (24Pan J.J. Yang L.W. Liang P.H. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 13856-13861Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Recently, the three-dimensional structure of UPPs from Micrococcus luteuswas solved by Fujihashi et al. (25Fujihashi M. Zhang Y.-W. Higuchi Y. Li X.-Y. Koyama T. Miki K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

We report the structure of E. coli UPPs, which is similar to the structure of M. luteus UPPs except that two protein conformers were discovered for E. coli UPPs. The large amino acid residues Ile-62, Leu-137, Val-105, and His-103, occupying the bottom portion of an elongated hydrophobic tunnel from the structure ofE. coli UPPs were replaced with Ala using site-directed mutagenesis to study the mechanism of product chain length determination. In addition, two amino acid residues, Ala-69 and Ala-143, located near the top of the hydrophobic tunnel in E. coli UPPs, were substituted with Leu and Val, respectively, as seen in the Mycobacterium tuberculosis Z-type short chain FPPs (26Schulbach M.C. Brennan P.J. Crick D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22876-22881Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) to examine the possible formation of a short chain product. Furthermore, a flexible loop without observable electron densities of residues 72–83 was found in both UPPs structures. Mutagenesis studies of the M. luteus enzyme suggest that loop residues Asn-77 and Trp-78 are important for catalysis and FPP binding (27Fujikura K. Zhang Y.-W. Yoshizki T. Koyama T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2000; 128: 917-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). To address the role of this loop in E. coli UPPs, we generated the loop mutants S71A, E73A, N74A, W75A, R77A, and E81A and measured the impact of loop residue replacement on substrate binding and catalysis.

https://openalex.org/W1985980866,"A novel mouse Siglec (mSiglec-F) belonging to the subfamily of Siglec-3-related Siglecs has been cloned and characterized. Unlike most human Siglec-3 (hSiglec-3)-related Siglecs with promiscuous linkage specificity, mSiglec-F shows a strong preference for alpha2-3-linked sialic acids. It is predominantly expressed in immature cells of the myelomonocytic lineage and in a subset of CD11b (Mac-1)-positive cells in some tissues. As with previously cloned Siglec-3-related mSiglecs, the lack of strong sequence similarity to a singular hSiglec made identification of the human ortholog difficult. We therefore conducted a comprehensive comparison of Siglecs between the human and mouse genomes. The mouse genome contains eight Siglec genes, whereas the human genome contains 11 Siglec genes and a Siglec-like gene. Although a one-to-one orthologous correspondence between human and mouse Siglecs 1, 2, and 4 is confirmed, the Siglec-3-related Siglecs showed marked differences between human and mouse. We found only four Siglec genes and two pseudogenes in the mouse chromosome 7 region syntenic to the Siglec-3-related gene cluster on human chromosome 19, which, in contrast, contains seven Siglec genes, a Siglec-like gene, and thirteen pseudogenes. Although analysis of gene maps and exon structures allows tentative assignments of mouse-human Siglec ortholog pairs, the possibility of unequal genetic recombination makes the assignments inconclusive. We therefore support a temporary lettered nomenclature for additional mouse Siglecs. Current information suggests that mSiglec-F is likely a hSiglec-5 ortholog. The previously reported mSiglec-3/CD33 and mSiglec-E/MIS are likely orthologs of hSiglec-3 and hSiglec-9, respectively. The other Siglec-3-like gene in the cluster (mSiglec-G) is probably a hSiglec-10 ortholog. Another mouse gene (mSiglec-H), without an apparent human ortholog, lies outside of the cluster. Thus, although some duplications of Siglec-3-related genes predated separation of the primate and rodent lineages (about 80-100 million years ago), this gene cluster underwent extensive duplications in the primate lineage thereafter."

ADPKD is characterized by the formation and progressive expansion of cysts in ductal organs including both kidneys as well as by cardiovascular abnormalities. About 85% of ADPKD cases are caused by defects in polycystin-1 (2The European Polycystic Kidney Disease Consortium Cell. 1994; 77: 881-894Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (746) Google Scholar, 3The International Polycystic Kidney Disease Consortium Cell. 1995; 81: 289-298Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar), a broadly expressed and developmentally regulated multi-span transmembrane protein with a large extracellular region rich in protein-protein and protein-carbohydrate interaction modules.

Invest. 1999; 79: 1311-1323PubMed Google Scholar), and in the cytoplasm. A fraction has also been found in the Triton X-100-insoluble cell fraction, reflecting a strong association with cytoskeleton (12Peters D.J. van de Wal A. Spruit L. Saris J.J. Breuning M.H. Bruijn J.A. de Heer E. J. Pathol. 1999; 188: 439-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Recently polycystin-1 was shown to be transported through a tuberin-dependent pathway to the lateral domain of cell membranes (13Kleymenova E. Ibraghimov-Beskrovnaya O. Kugoh H. Everitt J. Xu H. Kiguchi K. Landes G. Harris P. Walker C. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 823-832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The nature of the interactions utilized by polycystin-1 to localize at cell junctions associate with cytoskeleton or traffic to the cell surface is currently unknown. In this paper, we have identified a direct and specific interaction of polycystin-1 with the intermediate filament network. This interaction is mediated by the cytoplasmic tail of polycystin-1 binding directly to the IF proteins vimentin, cytokeratins 8 and 18, and desmin. Interaction was shown initially in a yeast two-hybrid screen of an epithelial cell library and confirmed both in vitro using GST pull-down and co-sedimentation assays and in whole cells using immunofluorescence analysis of both a membrane-anchored polycystin-1 cytoplasmic tail and the endogenous native protein. The functional significance of this association is discussed.DISCUSSIONThe studies presented in this paper identify a direct interaction between polycystin-1 and the intermediate filament network. We present four independent observations that document this interaction and its specificity. First, an unbiased search of an epithelial cell library for P1CT-interacting proteins identified vimentin as a strong interactant. We extended this observation to cytokeratins 8 and 18 and desmin, specialized IF proteins of epithelium, and muscle cells, respectively. Interaction required the coiled-coil motif of each partner. Second, P1CT interacted with full-length IF proteins in GST pull-down and in in vitro filament assembly experiments. Third, membrane-anchored P1CT associated with the Triton X-100-insoluble cytoskeleton fraction through its coiled-coil segment. Finally, P1CT decorated IFs, and native polycystin-1 distributed with cytokeratins at desmosomal junctions in MDCK cells. These observations are strong evidence of a direct polycystin-1-IF interaction bothin vitro and in vivo.Membrane-anchored P1CT decorated the cytoplasmic IF network, whereas native polycystin-1 was localized in association with IF at desmosomes. This difference in subcellular distribution between a native protein and a recombinant fragment thereof has been observed previously. For example, the recombinant IF-interacting domain of desmoplakin has been shown to decorate cytoplasmic IFs, in contrast to the desmosomal localization of the intact protein (25Kouklis P.D. Hutton E. Fuchs E. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1049-1060Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). This difference in distribution may relate to the presence of additional domains in the native protein that may target it differently. Alternatively, overexpression of the recombinant fragment may saturate binding sites in IFs, which may only be available to the native protein under certain conditions.The present data also show that P1CT interacts with IF subunits (Figs.1, 2, and 3 B) as well as with assembled IFs (Figs.3 E, 5, and 6). Because assembly of IF subunits into polymers is driven by the coiled-coil domain, these data raise the logical question of how P1CT can bind to assembled IFs in vivo. The assembled IF tetramer, schematically depicted in Fig. 2 A, shows that the coiled-coil domains of IFs are exposed at the ends of the soluble tetramers; these are the expected sites of binding to P1CT. P1CT-IF interaction appears therefore to be different from other IF interactions such as those between vimentin and fimbrin (46Correia I. Chu D. Chou Y.H. Goldman R.D. Matsudaira P. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 831-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar); in the latter case the nonhelical domain of vimentin mediates the binding. An additional feature of IF that may help explain why P1CT can bind IFin vivo is the fact that IF assembly/disassembly is a dynamic process; helical domains are exposed as IFs continuously remodel in vivo. This has been clearly demonstrated with fluorescence recovery after photobleaching analysis of GFP-vimentin expressing cells where fluorescence recovery occurs rapidly in the middle of bleached vimentin filaments without the translation of the gap in fluorescence to the ends of the filament (47Yoon M. Moir R.D. Prahlad V. Goldman R.D. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 147-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). We suggest that the association of the polycystin-1 represents incorporation into the sides of the continuously remodeled intermediate filaments.The localization of polycystin-1 at desmosomal junctions revealed in the present study is further supported by the congruent distribution of desmosomes and polycystin-1 in normal adult mouse kidney. In a systematic study of the expression of junctional proteins along the nephron, Piepenhagen and Nelson (48Piepenhagen P.A. Nelson W.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: C1433-C1449Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) found that the distribution of E-cadherin and α and β catenins is uniform in all nephron segments and that E-cadherin and α and β catenins are present along the entire length of the lateral cell membranes. In contrast, expression of the desmosomal marker desmoplakin is restricted to the distal nephron (beginning with the thick ascending loop of Henle, the distal convoluted and collecting tubules and collecting ducts), with the highest expression between the distal convoluted tubule and collecting ducts. Plakoglobin and cytokeratin K8, two other components of desmosomes, were strongly expressed in the same segments. The subcellular distribution of desmosomes was also segment-specific; desmoplakin was restricted to the apical-lateral membranes, co-localizing with ZO-1 in the distal convoluted tubules. In collecting tubules, desmoplakin was distributed to both lateral and basal membranes. The expression profile of desmoplakin and cytokeratin matches that of polycystin-1, which in adult kidney is also found in the thick ascending loop of Henle, the distal convoluted tubule, and most abundantly in collecting ducts with a predominant lateral junctional distribution (8Foggensteiner L. Bevan A.P. Thomas R. Coleman N. Boulter C. Bradley J. Ibraghimov-Beskrovnaya O. Klinger K. Sandford R. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2000; 11: 814-827Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 49Ong A.C. Ward C.J.

Pathol. 1999; 154: 1721-1729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar).The desmosome is a distinctive structure that tethers IFs to the plasma membrane and is most prominent in tissues exposed to mechanical stress (reviewed in Refs. 50Kowalczyk A.P. Bornslaeger E.A. Norvell S.M. Palka H.L. Green K.J. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1999; 185: 237-302Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 51Green K.J. Gaudry C.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 208-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). It is characterized by two parallel electron dense cytoplasmic plaques lying on either side of two adjacent plasma membranes that are separated by an intercellular electron-dense zipper-like midline. The latter is formed of desmosomal cadherins from apposing cells interacting homo- or heterotypically. Desmosomal junctions are the most specialized of vertebrate junctions and arose after adherens junctions in metazoan evolution; they also form after adherens junctions both during development and in cells that are induced to make junctions (reviewed in Ref. 51Green K.J. Gaudry C.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 208-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). In epithelial cells, desmosomal cadherins are linked to IFs mainly through plakoglobin and plakophillins (which, like β-catenin, are members of the armadillo family of nuclear and junctional proteins) and desmoplakins. Interaction among these proteins occurs in series: desmosomal cadherin-plakoglobin-desmoplakin-IF, mirroring protein interactions at adherens junctions (classic cadherins-β-α-catenins-microfilaments), or laterally (e.g. cadherin-desmoplakin-IF; cadherin-plakophilin-IF). Connections also exist across junctions (e.g.E-cadherin-plakoglobin; desmosomal cadherin-β-catenin; plakoglobin-α-catenin), underscoring a close relationship between desmosomes and adherens junctions. In endothelial cells, which lack desmosomal cadherins, cadherins form hybrid junctional complexes linking to both IFs and microfilaments.Our immunolocalization of endogenous polycystin-1 to desmosomes in epithelium and the supportive electron microscopy data of Scheffers et al. (9Scheffers M.S. van der Bent P. Prins F. Spruit L. Breuning M.H. Litvinov S.V. de Heer E. Peters D.J. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 2743-2750Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) also brings the question of how polycystin-1-IF interaction is possible at desmosomes, given the relatively short length of the polycystin-1 C-tail and the potential dense barrier to cell surface provided by the plaque proteins. One possibility is that IF may penetrate the plaque en route to the plasma membrane as previously reported (50Kowalczyk A.P. Bornslaeger E.A. Norvell S.M. Palka H.L. Green K.J. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1999; 185: 237-302Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 52McNutt N.S. Weinstein R.S. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1973; 26: 45-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar, 53Kelly D.E. Kuda A.M. Anat. Rec. 1981; 199: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). It has also been shown that plakophilin, which interacts directly with IF proteins, is localized very close to the plasma membrane in the desmosomal plaque (54North A.J. Bardsley W.G. Hyam J. Bornslaeger E.A. Cordingley H.C. Trinnaman B. Hatzfeld M. Green K.J. Magee A.I. Garrod D.R. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 4325-4336Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); an analogous situation may apply to polycystin-1. Alternatively, polycystin-1 may be localized at the periphery of desmosomes; IF converge at desmosomal plaques (55Garrod D.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 30-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar), and some may loop away toward the periphery, perhaps permitting additional interactions with other proteins such as polycystin-1.The interaction of polycystin-1 with IF may serve several functions. First, expression of desmoplakin, cytokeratin K8, and polycystin-1 in normal adult kidney is high in the distal half of the nephron where the degree of lateral membrane interdigitations between tubular epithelial cells is low. In this segment, paracellular conductances are low, and therefore the osmotic stress is high. An interdigitated lateral membrane and/or a well developed IF network and desmosomal junctions would render cells more resistant to deformation and other forms of physical stress. Polycystin-1 may contribute to the strengthening of lateral junctions, particularly in tissues where desmosomes are lacking as in endothelium. It is less likely that polycystin-1 is involved in initiating the formation of desmosomes because the phenotypes of mice with homozygous disruption of polycystin-1 or the desmosomal core protein desmoplakin are different (embryonic lethality occurs earlier before kidneys begin to form, when desmoplakin is disrupted (56Gallicano G.I. Kouklis P. Bauer C. Yin M. Vasioukhin V. Degenstein L. Fuchs E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 2009-2022Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar)). Also, in calcium switch experiments, the appearance of polycystin-1 at lateral junctions follows that of desmoplakin. This observation may account for the different phenotypes in the knockout animals (reviewed in Ref. 51Green K.J. Gaudry C.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 208-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar) and suggests that polycystin-1 plays a maintenance rather than an initiation role at desmosomesSecond, localization of polycystin-1 at desmosomes may be crucial for its signaling functions.

Polycystin-1 has also been shown to assist in the transport of polycystin-2 to the cell surface (59Hanaoka K. Qian F. Boletta A. Bhunia A.K. Piontek K. Tsiokas L. Sukhatme V.P. Guggino W.B.

The IF vimentin has been reported recently to serve as a reservoir for the cell trafficking protein SNAP23 (72Faigle W. Colucci-Guyon E. Louvard D. Amigorena S. Galli T. Mol. Biol.

The presence of polycystin-1 foci that are associated with neither keratin filaments nor desmoplakin (Fig. 6) may reflect the presence of an additional intracellular polycystin-1 pool with distinct intramolecular associations. Failure to deliver polycystins to cell membranes, caused either by a malfunctioning protein (73Palsson R. Sharma C. Kim K. McLaughlin M. Brown D. Arnaout M. Mol.

Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD)1 is one of the most common genetic diseases in humans, affecting ∼1 in 400 individuals and accounting for 8–10% of end stage renal disease (1Arnaout M.A. Annu. Rev. Med. 2001; 52: 93-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). ADPKD is characterized by the formation and progressive expansion of cysts in ductal organs including both kidneys as well as by cardiovascular abnormalities. About 85% of ADPKD cases are caused by defects in polycystin-1 (2The European Polycystic Kidney Disease Consortium Cell. 1994; 77: 881-894Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (746) Google Scholar, 3The International Polycystic Kidney Disease Consortium Cell. 1995; 81: 289-298Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar), a broadly expressed and developmentally regulated multi-span transmembrane protein with a large extracellular region rich in protein-protein and protein-carbohydrate interaction modules. Although this composition is suggestive of a role in cell-cell and/or cell-matrix adhesion, the precise function(s) mediated by polycystin-1 remains unknown. Genetic, immunochemical, and biochemical studies have suggested that polycystin-1 is involved in maintaining the structural integrity of cell-cell junctions in vascular and epithelial structures. In mouse models of ADPKD, mouse embryos lacking a functional polycystin-1 are uniformly edematous (4Kim K. Drummond I. Ibraghimov-Beskrovnaya1 O. Klinger K. Arnaout M.A. Proc. Nat'l Acad. Sci. U. S.

The nature of the interactions utilized by polycystin-1 to localize at cell junctions associate with cytoskeleton or traffic to the cell surface is currently unknown. In this paper, we have identified a direct and specific interaction of polycystin-1 with the intermediate filament network. This interaction is mediated by the cytoplasmic tail of polycystin-1 binding directly to the IF proteins vimentin, cytokeratins 8 and 18, and desmin.

However, the mechanisms that target and/or anchor various types of channels within the membranes of neurons are not fully understood.

Moreover, a different complement of sodium channel isotypes are expressed in small DRG neurons with nonmyelinated fibers compared with large DRG neurons with myelinated fibers (9Black J.A.

The mechanisms underlying targeting and retention of sodium channels at the somata and axonal membrane of nonmyelinated fibers have not been studied and may be distinct from those that localize sodium channels at nodes of Ranvier in myelinated fibers. In the present study, we used a combination of biochemical and cell biological approaches to identify proteins that may play a role in the targeting of Nav1.9/NaN to the cell surface of DRG neurons, and we have identified contactin as a channel partner that binds directly to the channel and appears to function in this role. Affinity-purified polyclonal Nav1.9/NaN-specific antibodies against the C-terminal 18-amino acid peptide of this channel were described previously (40Fjell J. Hjelmstrom P. Hormuzdiar W.

Anti-GFP polyclonal antibodies were purchased from CLONTECH, and anti-human tenascin monoclonal antibodies (clnT2H5) were purchased from Exalpha Biologicals, Inc. (Boston). Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells and CHO fibroblasts were used in this study. The bacterial expression plasmid pGEX-NaNC carrying the insert for the C-terminal polypeptide of Nav1.9/NaN (amino acids 1588–1765; GenBankTM accession number AF059030) was described previously (42Liu C. Dib-Hajj S.D. Waxman S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18925-18933Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Nav1.9a/NaN cDNA was cloned into the low copy number mammalian expression plasmid pLG338/Sport (43Cunningham T.P. Montelaro R.C. Rushlow K.E. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 124: 93-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) to produce the vector pLG338/NaN. The sequence of this insert shows the following changes compared with the published Nav1.9 sequence: a serine to proline substitution at position 962 in the cytoplasmic loop joining domains 2 and 3 (L2); a deletion of 11 amino acids (1000–1010) at the C-terminal end of L2; and a leucine to proline substitution at position 1282 in transmembrane segment 6 (S6) of domain 3. Transfection of HEK293 cell line with this construct does not produce a sodium current above background 2S. D. Dib-Hajj, L. Tyrrell, T. R. Cummins, J. Greenwood, and S. G. Wayman, unpublished results. but produces a protein of the expected size of the channel when analyzed by immunoblot assay (see under “Results”). Full-length contactin cDNA (GenBankTM accession number D38492) was amplified by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction from rat brain template and cloned in-frame with GFP using the KpnI/XhoI sites of pEGFO-N1 fusion vector (CLONTECH) to produce pContactin-GFP plasmid. The constructs generated were verified by sequencing and expression assay. Sequencing was carried out at the HHMI/Keck Biotechnology Resource Laboratory at Yale University. Details of the constructs are available upon request. For expressing glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins, the appropriate plasmids pGEX3X and pGEX-NaN-C were transformed into Escherichia coli DH5α (Life Technologies, Inc.). Fusion proteins were affinity-purified on glutathione-agarose beads as described previously (44Liu C.J. Wang H. Lengyel P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2845-2854Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Purified GST fusion proteins were dialyzed against PBS (pH 7.1) at 4 °C for 24 h. Purified proteins (3 mg) were cross-linked to 1 ml of Affi-Gel 15 (Bio-Rad) in buffer A (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.6) at 4 °C overnight. GST- and GST-NaNC-Affi-Gel 15 beads were then blocked with buffer B (0.1 m ethanolamine HCl, pH 8.0) on ice for 1 h. The affinity resin was then washed sequentially with 0.5 ml each of buffer C (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 125 mm NaCl, 20% glycerol) containing 1 mm DTT, buffer C containing 1 mm DTT and 2.5 m urea, buffer C containing 1 mm DTT and 4 m urea, and finally buffer D (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 125 mmNaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA) supplemented with protease inhibitors. Bovine serum albumin (BSA)-Affi-Gel 15 beads were generated in a similar manner and were used to pre-adsorb the brain extracts prior to their application to the GST- and GST-NaNC-Affi-Gel 15 to reduce the nonspecific binding of proteins to these matrices. Full brains from 20 adult rats were homogenized in ice-cold buffer D, and Triton X-100 was added to 1%, and the proteins were solubilized for 1 h at 4 °C. The homogenate was centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C three times to clear the supernatant. Nonspecific protein binding was reduced by pre-adsorbing the supernatant with 2 ml of BSA-Affi-Gel 15 beads at 4 °C for 2 h. After the BSA beads were removed, 50 and 5 ml of the pre-adsorbed extracts were incubated overnight at 4 °C on a shaker with 0.5 ml of GST-NaNC-Affi-Gel 15 and 0.05 ml of GST-Affi-Gel 15 (serving as control), respectively. The extract/beads were extensively washed with buffer D containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1% Triton X-100, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride followed by buffer D containing 1% Triton X-100. Proteins were eluted sequentially with 2.5 ml each of buffer D containing 1% Triton X-100 and 2.5 murea, buffer D containing 1% Triton X-100 and 4 m urea, and finally buffer D containing 1% SDS. Eluted proteins were precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid and 0.05% deoxycholic acid, and the proteins were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE. The gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-Colloidal solution (Sigma) according to the vendor's recommendations. The visible protein bands of interest were excised and prepared for mass spectrometric analysis. The gel pieces were washed at room temperature in the following solutions: acetonitrile 50% for 5 min; 50% CH3CN, 50 mmNH4HCO3 for 30 min; and then in 50% CH3CN, 10 mm NH4HCO3for 30 min. The samples were dried in a SpeedVac Concentrator (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany), and a trypsin solution (0.05 μg of trypsin per 7 μl of 10 mmNH4HCO3) was added and allowed to incubate at 37 °C for 24 h. The supernatants of the trypsin digestion products were collected and analyzed using mass spectrometry. The standards used for the calibration of peptide masses are bradykinin (average M + H, 1061.23 Da) and ACTH Clip (average M + H, 2466.70 Da). One microliter of the tryptic digest was mixed with 1.0 μl of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (4.5 mg/ml in 50% CH3CN, 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid) matrix solution, and 1 μl of calibrants (100 fmol) each. The mixture was loaded onto the sample plate and then injected into the Perspective Biosystem Voyager-DE STR instrument. The spectra of the peptides were acquired in reflector/delayed extraction mode. The identity of the peptides was determined using the ProFound-Peptide Mapping search engine (www.proteometrics.com/profound_bin/WebProFound.exe) and subsequently searched against Swiss-Prot (www.expasy.ch/) or PIR site (www.nbrf.georgetown.edu/). To examine the binding of contactin to the C terminus of Nav1.9/NaN in vitro, glutathione-Sepharose beads loaded with GST (0.5 μg), serving as control, or GST-NaN-C (0.5 μg) were incubated with extract (500 μg of protein) from HEK293 cells transfected with an expression plasmid encoding either GFP alone or full-length contactin-GFP, as indicated, in 150 μl of buffer AM (45Voit R. Schafer K. Grummt I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4230-4237Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) supplemented with 100 mm KCl and 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (44Liu C.J. Wang H. Lengyel P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2845-2854Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The bound proteins were separated by 7.5% SDS-PAGE, and GFP fusion proteins were detected by immunoblotting with anti-GFP antibodies (CLONTECH). To test whether contactin is required for the binding of tenascin to Nav1.9/NaN in vitro, 1 μg of human tenascin (Life Technologies, Inc.) was incubated with glutathione-Sepharose beads loaded with GST (0.5 μg), or GST-NaN-C (0.5 μg), or GST-NaN-C (0.5 μg) which was preincubated with either GFP or contactin-GFP from HEK293 cell lysates (see above). The multiprotein components were incubated in 150 μl of buffer AM supplemented with 100 mmKCl and 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin as described above. The bound proteins were separated by 7.5% SDS-PAGE, and tenascin was detected by immunoblotting with anti-tenascin monoclonal antibodies (clnT2H5). Far Western blotting was carried out according to Lee et al. (46Lee W.S. Kao C.C. Bryant G.O. Liu X. Berk A.J. Cell. 1991; 67: 365-376Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar) with minor modification. After a 1-h incubation with anti-GFP antibodies, cell extracts prepared from HEK293 cells transfected with an expression plasmid encoding either GFP or contactin-GFP fusion protein were incubated with 50 μl of protein A-agarose at 4 °C overnight. After washing five times, the purified GFP (control) and contactin-GFP were subjected to 12% SDS-PAGE. The proteins were electrotransferred to nitrocellulose at 85 mA for 2 h. The proteins on the blot were denatured and renatured by sequential washings in 0.1 m CZ solution (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 20% glycerol, 0.1 m KCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 0.1 mm ZnCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol) plus 0.02% polyvinylpyrrolidone and 6 m guanidine HCl for 30 min one time and then 3 times in 0.1 m CZ solution plus 0.02% polyvinylpyrrolidone for 2 h. After blocking with 5% BSA, the membranes were incubated with 50 μg/ml purified GST-NaN-C followed by anti-Nav1.9/NaN (0.2 μg/ml) antibodies. HEK293 cells were grown in 100-mm dishes in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. After reaching 50% confluence, the cultures were co-transfected with the mammalian expression plasmids pContactin-GFP and pLG328-NaN. The cultures were harvested 48 h later, and cell extracts were prepared according to Liu et al. (47Liu C. Wang H. Zhao Z., Yu, S. Lu Y.B. Meyer J. Chatterjee G. Deschamps S. Roe B.A. Lengyel P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7024-7036Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). After 1 h of incubation with Nav1.9/NaN-specific antisera (20 μg/ml), aliquots (200 μl) from the cell extracts were incubated with 30 μl of protein A-agarose (Life Technologies, Inc.) at 4 °C overnight. After washing five times with IP buffer (48Wang H. Liu C. Lu Y. Chatterjee G. Ma X.Y. Eisenman R.N. Lengyel P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27377-27385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the bound proteins were released by boiling in 20 μl of 2× SDS sample buffer for 3 min. The released proteins were examined by Western blotting with anti-contactin monoclonal antibodies (from Dr. Fritz G. Rathjen (41Brummendorf T. Hubert M. Treubert U. Leuschner R. Tarnok A. Rathjen F.G. Neuron. 1993; 10: 711-727Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar)). For immunoprecipitation of Nav1.9/NaN and contactin from native tissue, DRGs were homogenized in ice-cold buffer D containing 1% Triton X-100 and protease inhibitors, and the proteins were extracted for 1 h at 4 °C. Protein extracts (500 μg) were incubated with 5 μl of control IgG (20 μg/ml), or anti-Nav1.9/NaN (20 μg/ml), or anti-contactin (1:40) (from Dr Jim Salzer (28Rios J.C. Melendez-Vasquez C.V.

The mixture was then incubated with 50 μl of protein A-agarose at 4 °C overnight. Detection of the immunoreactive proteins was carried out as described above using anti-Nav1.9/NaN antibody (0.2 μg/ml). Dishes of transfected CHO cells were washed three times with ice-cold PBS, pH 8.0, and the cells were collected by centrifugation at 500 × g for 5 min, and surface proteins were biotinylated with 0.5 mg/ml sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin (Pierce) in PBS, pH 8.0, at room temperature for 30 min according to the manufacturer's recommendation. These cultures were washed 3 times in PBS, and the cells were lysed in PBS, pH 8.0, containing 1% Triton X-100, 5 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitors at 4 °C for 1 h. Cell extracts (500 μg of proteins) were immunoprecipitated with either 5 μl of anti-Nav1.9/NaN antibodies (20 μg/ml) for 1 h at 4 °C followed by protein A-agarose or 100 μl of streptavidin-agarose (Pierce) at 4 °C overnight. The immunoprecipitated proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-Nav1.9/NaN antibodies or peroxidase-conjugated monoclonal anti-biotin antibodies (BN-34, Sigma). Cultures of DRG neurons were established as described previously (49Rizzo M.A. Kocsis J.D. Waxman S.G. J. Neurophysiol. 1994; 72: 2796-2815Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Briefly, lumbar ganglia (L4 and L5) from adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were excised, freed from their connective tissue sheaths, and incubated sequentially in enzyme solutions containing collagenase and then papain. The tissue was triturated in culture medium containing 1:1 Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and Hanks' F-12 medium and 10% fetal calf serum, 1.5 mg/ml trypsin inhibitor, 1.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin and plated on polyornithine/laminin-coated coverslips. The cells were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified 95% air, 5% CO2 incubator overnight or for 7 days. For cultures maintained for 7 days, glial-derived neurotrophic factor (50 ng/ml; human recombinant, PeproTech, Rocky Hill, NJ) was added to the culture medium, which was changed every other day (12Fjell J. Cummins T.R. Dib-Hajj S.D. Fried K. Black J.A. Waxman S.G. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1999; 67: 267-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Coverslips with DRG neurons or CHO cells were processed for immunocytochemistry as described previously (50Sleeper A.A. Cummins T.R. Dib-Hajj S.D. Hormuzdiar W. Tyrrell L. Waxman S.G. Black J.A. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 7279-7289Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, coverslips were incubated sequentially in the following: 1) complete saline solution, 2 times for 1 min each; 2) 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.14 m Sorensen's phosphate buffer, 10 min; 3) PBS, 3 times for 3 min each; 4) PBS containing 5% normal goat serum, 2% bovine serum albumin, and 0.1% Triton X-100, 15 min; 5) primary antibodies (polyclonal Nav1.9/NaN, 2 μg/ml, in blocking solution; monoclonal contactin, 1.25 μg/ml, BD Biosciences) in blocking solution overnight at 4 °C; 6) PBS, 6 times for 5 min each; 7) secondary antibodies (goat anti-rabbit IgG-Cy3, 1:3000;Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, and donkey anti-mouse IgG-Cy2, 1:250; Rockland, Inc.); and 8) PBS, 6 times for 5 min each. Thin cryosections (10 μm) of DRG from perfused rats were mounted on Fischer SuperFrost Plus glass slides. For teased nerve analysis, sciatic nerves from perfused rats were excised, incubated in a solution containing 0.5 mg/ml each of collagenase A and collagenase D (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 30 min at 37 °C, desheathed, placed on Fisher SuperFrost Plus slides, and fibers gently teased apart. The sections or teased nerves were processed for immunocytochemistry as described above with the exception of the fixation incubation. Following the immunocytochemical procedures, the coverslips or slides were mounted with Aqua-polymount (Polysciences, Warrington, PA). Control experiments included incubation without primary antibody and pre-adsorption of the antibody with 100–500 molar excess of immunizing peptide. Only background levels of fluorescence were detected in the control experiments (data not shown). Cells and sections were examined with a confocal laser scanning microscope (Nikon PCM 2000) using 20× NA 0.75 or 60× NA 1.4 objectives. Cells and tissue were optically sectioned in thexy plane with a minimum slice thickness of 0.5 μm with multiple scan averaging. Confocal images were processed with Adobe Photoshop.

These events are: covalent attachment of an isoprenoid lipid (farnesyl or geranylgeranyl) to the cysteine, proteolytic removal of the AAX tripeptide, and carboxyl methylesterification of the newly exposed COOH-terminal prenylcysteine (1Zhang F.L.

Examples of proteins that undergo CAAX processing (CAAX proteins) include small GTP-binding proteins, such as Ras and Rho, the γ subunit of some heterotrimeric G-proteins, nuclear lamins, and certain fungal mating pheromones, such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae a-factor. Genetic analyses of S. cerevisiae have identified two genes that encode candidate CAAX proteases, STE24 (also designated AFC1) and RCE1 (8Boyartchuk V.L. Ashby M.N. Rine J. Science. 1997; 275: 1796-1800Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 9Fujimura-Kamada K. Nouvet F.J. Michaelis S. J.

Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 635-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Despite the lack of protein sequence similarity between Ste24p and Rce1p, both are predicted to have multiple membrane spans and are localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)1membrane (11Schmidt W.K. Tam A. Fujimura-Kamada K. Michaelis S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11175-11180Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Consistent with its proposed role as a protease, Ste24p has a conserved zinc metalloprotease motif (HEXXH; where H is histidine, E is glutamate, and X is any amino acid). Mutation of this motif severely compromises in vivo a-factor production and thus the mating competence ofMAT a cells (9Fujimura-Kamada K. Nouvet F.J. Michaelis S. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 271-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in vitroSte24p-dependent CAAX proteolysis is sensitive to the metalloprotease inhibitor 1,10-orthophenanthroline (8Boyartchuk V.L. Ashby M.N. Rine J. Science. 1997; 275: 1796-1800Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Rce1p, on the other hand, lacks known protease motifs. Nevertheless, Rce1p-dependent CAAX proteolysis is sensitive to certain cysteine protease inhibitors (12Dolence J.M. Steward L.E. Dolence E.K. Wong D.H. Poulter C.D. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4096-4104Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The specific combination ofAAX residues influences whether proteolysis of a CAAX protein is carried out by Ste24p, Rce1p, or both (8Boyartchuk V.L. Ashby M.N. Rine J.

Either Ste24p or Rce1p can promote a-factor CAAX proteolysis, whereas Ras proteolysis in yeast and mammalian cells is strictly Rce1p-dependent (8Boyartchuk V.L. Ashby M.N. Rine J.

In addition to promoting the COOH-terminal CAAX proteolysis of the a-factor precursor, genetic studies indicate that Ste24p is involved in a separate proteolytic event duringa-factor biogenesis (9Fujimura-Kamada K. Nouvet F.J. Michaelis S. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 271-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 10Tam A. Nouvet F. Fujimura-Kamada K. Slunt H. Sisodia S.S. Michaelis S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 635-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The P1 a-factor intermediate, which is fully COOH-terminally modified (farnesylated, proteolyzed, and carboxyl methylated), contains an NH2-terminal extension that undergoes two successive proteolytic cleavages to yield first P2, and finally mature (M)a-factor. The first cleavage (P1 → P2 conversion) occurs between residues Thr7 and Ala8 of P1a-factor and is dependent on Ste24p (9Fujimura-Kamada K. Nouvet F.J. Michaelis S. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 271-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 15Chen P. Sapperstein S. Choi J.D. Michaelis S. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 251-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Because of the redundant function of the Ste24p and Rce1 in COOH-terminal CAAX proteolysis, the observed defect of a ste24mutant is inefficient cleavage at the first NH2-terminal cleavage site, which leads to the accumulation of the P1a-factor intermediate. The second NH2-terminal cleavage event during a-factor biogenesis (P2 → M conversion) removes the remainder of the NH2-terminal extension to complete the maturation of a-factor and is dependent upon Axl1p (16Adames N. Blundell K. Ashby M.N. Boone C. Science. 1995; 270: 464-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). An important question that remains to be answered is whether Ste24p and/or Rce1p act directly as proteases, or whether they function indirectly as activators of another protease(s). Recent in vitro reconstitution experiments, using membranes prepared from wild-type and mutant yeast strains or insect cells expressing recombinant protein, firmly establish that both can function in CAAX proteolysis (8Boyartchuk V.L. Ashby M.N. Rine J. Science. 1997; 275: 1796-1800Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 11Schmidt W.K. Tam A. Fujimura-Kamada K. Michaelis S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

These studies, however, cannot answer whether Ste24p or Rce1p is sufficient for proteolysis, since crude membrane preparations were used in the reconstitution experiments rather than purified components. Thus, the possibility that Ste24p and Rce1p are limiting upstream activators of an unknown protease or are part of a multicomponent protease present in these membrane preparations cannot yet be excluded. Similarly, membrane reconstitution experiments have shown that Ste24p (but not Rce1p) is necessary for NH2-terminal proteolysis of P1a-factor; however, its sufficiency has not been addressed (17Schmidt W.K. Tam A. Michaelis S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6227-6233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). To determine if Ste24p directly mediates its two proposed activities, COOH-terminal CAAX processing and NH2-terminal proteolysis of P1 a-factor, we purified a histidine-tagged version of Ste24p from yeast. We demonstrate that Ste24p is sufficient to carry out CAAX proteolysis of a synthetic, farnesylateda-factor peptide in a zinc-dependent fashion. Hence, this report establishes that Ste24p is a bona fideCAAX protease. In addition, we show that purified Ste24p possesses the ability to cleave within the NH2-terminal extension of the P1 a-factor intermediate. Thus, Ste24p can catalyze two distinct cleavage events in a-factor biogenesis. The yeast strains used in this study are listed in Table I.

The unmodified 15-mer peptide was enzymatically farnesylated in vitro using purified farnesyltransferase and farnesyl diphosphate according to published methods by Dr. J. Otto (Duke University) (14Otto J.C. Kim E. Young S.G. Casey P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8379-8382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). A stock solution of this peptide was prepared at 165 μm in MeOH and stored at −80 °C. Membrane preparations derived from WT or mutant strains serve as the source of protease. A membrane preparation derived from a yeast strain that encodes STE14 on a high-copy plasmid and lacks chromosomal copies of STE24 and RCE1(SM3614/pSM1317) serves as the source of carboxyl methyltransferase. All membrane preparations were typically prepared as previously described at 1–3 mg/ml in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, 0.2m sorbitol, 1 mm EDTA, 0.02% NaN3, pH 7.5) and stored at −80 °C until needed (17Schmidt W.K. Tam A. Michaelis S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6227-6233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The methyl donorS-adenosyl-l-methionine and other reagents were purchased from Sigma. CAAX proteolysis reactions (typically 20 μl) were assembled on ice in a 96-well polystyrene microtiter plate by mixing 10 μl of farnesylated 15-mer (2 μm (38 ng) peptide in 200 mm HEPES, 200 mm NaCl, pH 7.5) and 10 μl of yeast membranes (diluted into lysis buffer at the indicated concentrations). Where noted, reaction mixtures contained the metal chelator, 1,10-orthophenanthroline. Proteolysis was initiated by shifting the reaction mixtures to 30 °C. After 10 min, proteolysis was terminated by heating the reaction mixtures to 95 °C for 1 min. Methylation reactions were assembled on ice by adding carboxyl methyltransferase-containing membranes (0.1 mg/ml final) and S-adenosyl-l-methionine (20 μm final) to the terminated CAAX proteolysis reaction mixtures. These components were prepared as a 4 × mixture prior to addition. Methylation was initiated by shifting the reactions to 30 °C. After 60 min, methylation was terminated by heating to 95 °C for 1 min or by adding copper acetate (2 mm final). To detect bioactive a-factor generated in coupled assays, published methods were followed (18Michaelis S. Herskowitz I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 1309-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 20Nijbroek G.L. Michaelis S. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 292: 193-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Briefly, a portion of the coupled reaction mixture and serial 2-fold dilutions (into YPD media) thereof were spotted (2 μl/spot) onto a lawn of supersensitiveMATα sst2 cells (SM1086) spread on a YPD plate. Plates were incubated for 16–20 h at 30 °C to allow for growth of the lawn. The minimum concentration of a-factor that can produce a detectable halo, 12 pg/μl, is termed the a-factor end point (6Marcus S. Caldwell G.A. Miller D. Xue C.-B. Naider F. Becker J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3603-3612Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Thus, the amount of a-factor contained in a sample can be extrapolated from the highest dilution at which a halo is observed (e.g. a sample that has an end point at a dilution of 1:8 contains 192 pg of a-factor per 2 μl of spotted volume, or ∼2.5 ng per total 26-μl reaction mixture). Coupled reactions with membrane fractions were carried out as above except that14C-S-adenosyl-l-methionine (60 mCi/mmol; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was used in the methylation reaction. The amount of base-labile carboxyl methyl esters formed in the coupled assay was quantified by a vapor diffusion assay, as previously described (21Hrycyna C.A. Wait S.J. Backlund P.S. Michaelis S. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 250: 251-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Mid-log phase yeast cells (1600 A 600units) expressing Ste24p-His-HAN were harvested, washed in 10 mm NaN3, frozen at −80 °C, and subsequently converted to spheroplasts using oxalyticase as previously described (22Romano J.D. Schmidt W.K. Michaelis S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 2231-2247Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). All further steps were carried out at 4 °C. Spheroplasts were lysed by resuspension in detergent solubilization buffer (DSB; 20 mm HEPES or Tris, pH 7.4, 10% glycerol, 50 mm NaCl, 1% dodecyl maltoside) containing imidazole (20 mm) and protease inhibitors (3 μg/ml leupeptin, chymostatin, and pepstatin; 2 μg/ml aprotinin; 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) at 20 A 600 units of cells per ml. After incubation for 30 min on ice, the lysate was clarified (14,000 × g, 30 min), and incubated in batch with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA)-agarose resin (3.125 μl of resin/ml of lysate; Qiagen) that was prewashed with DSB prior to use. After a 1.5-h incubation with mixing, the resin was transferred to a disposable chromatography column, washed four times with 20 ml of Buffer A (20 mm HEPES or Tris, pH 7.4, 10% glycerol, 250 mm NaCl, 2% Triton X-100, and 40 mmimidazole), and once with 5 ml of DSB containing 40 mmimidazole. Bound Ste24p-His-HAN was released from the resin by sequential washes with elution buffer 1 (0.5 ml; DSB containing 100 mm imidazole) and elution buffer 2 (1 ml; DSB containing 250 mm imidazole). The protein concentration of each fraction (clarified total lysate (T), flow-through material (FT) washes (W1–5), and elutions containing Ste24p-His-HAn (E)) was determined by published methods (23Schaffner W. Weissman C. Anal. Biochem. 1973; 56: 502-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (1954) Google Scholar). Samples of each fraction were subjected to SDS-PAGE, silver staining, and the coupled CAAXactivity assay. Coupled assays were carried out essentially as described above except that the protease was derived from fractions of the Ni-NTA affinity chromatography purification procedure of Ste24p. For comparing the activity of fractions, CAAX proteolysis reactions were assembled on ice by mixing 10 μl of farnesylated 15-mer (2 μm), 9 μl of H2O, and 1 μl of a diluted fraction from the purification procedure. Fractions were diluted 1:17.5 into elution buffer (20 mm HEPES or Tris pH 7.4, 10% glycerol, 50 mm NaCl, 1% dodecyl maltoside, 250 mm imidazole) to normalize buffer components, particularly detergent, between samples and to bring the activity of each sample within the linear range of the proteolysis assay. The final concentration of purified Ste24p in the reaction was 250 pg/μl for the peak fraction (Fig. 3). To determine the requirement of zinc in CAAX proteolysis, purified Ste24p (500 ng/ml) was pretreated with 1,10-orthophenanthroline (1 mm) for 20 min on ice, prior to mixing with the substrate-containing solution and the indicated concentration of metal ion. Samples subjected to CAAX proteolysis (as described above) were adsorbed to ZipTip C18 beads (Millipore), washed three times with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and eluted with 75% acetonitrile before analysis by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine Synthesis & Sequencing Facility. P1 a-factor was immunoprecipitated from yeast cells radiolabeled with [35S]cysteine, as previously described (17Schmidt W.K. Tam A. Michaelis S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6227-6233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The immunoprecipitate was resuspended into 0.1 n NaOH and incubated for 30 min at 30 °C to release P1 a-factor from immune complexes. Prior to use in the proteolysis reaction, the pH of the eluted sample was neutralized by the addition of 0.1m HEPES free acid. N-terminal proteolysis reactions (25 μl final volume) were assembled on ice to contain purified radiolabeled P1 a-factor,Escherichia coli lipid (0.025%) (Avanti Polar Lipid), and either purified Ste24p (4 μg/ml) (the E2 fraction in elution buffer 2), a mock-purified E2 fraction in elution buffer 2 obtained from a lysate lacking histidine-tagged Ste24p, or elution buffer 2 only. Where indicated, the reaction mixture also contained 1,10-orthophenanthroline (1 mm). Proteolysis was initiated by shifting the reaction mixtures to 30 °C. After 1 h, proteolysis was terminated by the addition of 6 × Laemmli sample buffer. Equivalent portions from each reaction mixture were analyzed by modified SDS-PAGE and PhosphorImager along with samples of the crude lysate and immunopurified P1 a-factor (15Chen P. Sapperstein S. Choi J.D. Michaelis S. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 251-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 17Schmidt W.K. Tam A. Michaelis S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6227-6233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Proteinase K-protection experiments were performed as previously described (24Romano J.D. Michaelis S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1957-1971Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), but using spheroplasts generated as above. Briefly, reactions contained clarified yeast membranes (3.2 mg/ml final) with or without Proteinase K (0.3 mg/ml final; Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in the presence or absence of Triton X-100 (0.4% final). After allowing the reaction to proceed for 5 min on ice, digestion was terminated by the addition of trichloroacetic acid (10% final). Equivalent portions of samples were separated by SDS·PAGE and subjected to immunoblot analysis using antibodies against HA (BabCo), Kar2p (gift of J. Brodsky), and the Ste24p COOH terminus (17Schmidt W.K. Tam A. Michaelis S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6227-6233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Because proteolysis is prerequisite for the carboxyl methylation of prenylated CAAX substrates, coupled proteolysis/methylation assays can be used to follow CAAXproteolysis in vitro (14Otto J.C. Kim E. Young S.G. Casey P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8379-8382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 21Hrycyna C.A. Wait S.J. Backlund P.S. Michaelis S. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 250: 251-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 25Ashby M.N. Rine J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 250: 235-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In such assays, the presence of a base-labile methyl group serves to indirectly monitor CAAX proteolysis. Typically, methylation is followed with radioactive tracers (e.g. 14C-methyl transfer from14C-methyl-S-adenosyl-l-methionine). Here we have developed a nonradioactive coupled system, schematized in Fig. 1 A, that can be used in conjunction with a highly sensitive bioassay to indirectly monitor CAAX proteolysis. The substrate in this system is a farnesylated 15-mer peptide that contains the maturea-factor peptide sequence and the native a-factor CAAX motif. This substrate is biologically inactive. CAAX proteolysis and subsequent carboxyl methylation convert this inactive 15-mer substrate into a farnesylated and carboxyl methylated 12-mer that is identical to biosynthetically generated active a-factor, which can be detected using an established bioassay. In this bioassay, samples containing a-factor generate a zone (also termed a halo) of growth inhibition when spotted onto a lawn of MATα sst2 yeast cells (18Michaelis S. Herskowitz I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 1309-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 20Nijbroek G.L. Michaelis S. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 292: 193-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The minimum concentration of a-factor that can produce a halo is 12 pg/μl, which is termed the a-factor end point (6Marcus S. Caldwell G.A. Miller D. Xue C.-B. Naider F. Becker J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3603-3612Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Thus by determining the highest dilution at which a sample can still generate a detectable halo, the amount of maturea-factor produced in the reaction can be extrapolated. Under the conditions used here, CAAX proteolysis is rate-limiting. Thus, the amount of a-factor generated provides an indirect measurement of proteolytic activity. We compared the sensitivity of this nonradioactive coupled assay to that of a traditional radioactive coupled assay (21Hrycyna C.A. Wait S.J. Backlund P.S. Michaelis S. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 250: 251-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Overall, for both assays, we observed a clear linear correlation between the amount of protease-containing membranes added to the reaction mixture and the amount of active a-factor produced (Fig. 1, B andC, closed squares) or the amount of volatile radioactive methyl esters produced (Fig. 1 C, open diamonds). As expected, the substrate becomes limiting in the presence of high levels of enzyme, as is evident at the highest concentration of membranes examined (400 μg/ml). An important advantage of the a-factor bioassay as compared with the radioactive assay is apparent at the lowest membrane protein concentrations (Fig. 1 C, inset). The a-factor bioassay showed no background activity when membranes were absent from the reaction mixture, whereas the radioactive assay showed a relatively high level of background counts without added membranes. Since the very low levels of CAAX processing activity present in many biological samples can be obscured in the radioactive coupled system, the a-factor bioassay provides a more sensitive method of detection (26Leung G.K. Schmidt W.K. Bergo M.O. Gavino B. Wong D.H. Tam A. Ashby M.N. Michaelis S. Young S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29051-29058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Using the nonradioactive coupled assay, we compared the CAAXproteolytic activity of yeast membranes derived from wild type and mutant yeast strains (Fig. 2, solid bars). Membranes lacking both Rce1p and Ste24p (rce1Δ ste24Δ) were unable to promote CAAX processing. On the other hand, membranes that contain both Rce1p and Ste24p (WT), Rce1p only (RCE1 ste24Δ), or Ste24p only (rce1Δ STE24) were competent for CAAX processing. These results confirm previous in vivo and in vitrofindings that either Rce1p or Ste24p can suffice for CAAXproteolysis of a-factor (8Boyartchuk V.L. Ashby M.N. Rine J. Science. 1997; 275: 1796-1800Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 10Tam A. Nouvet F. Fujimura-Kamada K. Slunt H. Sisodia S.S. Michaelis S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 635-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Similar to what was seen in an earlier study, we find that CAAX processing in a strain deleted for Ste24p is not significantly impaired, possibly because Rce1p is up-regulated under these circumstances (8Boyartchuk V.L. Ashby M.N. Rine J. Science. 1997; 275: 1796-1800Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). As expected, we also found that Ste24p-dependent a-factor production is inhibited by the metalloprotease inhibitor 1,10-orthophenanthroline, whereas Rce1p-dependent production was unaffected (Fig. 2, open bars). Importantly, our results validate the coupled system in conjunction with thea-factor bioassay as a reliable method for monitoring CAAX proteolysis. Thus far, no study has unequivocally demonstrated that either Ste24p or Rce1p directly mediates CAAX proteolysis. To address this issue, we sought to purify Ste24p and determine whether it retained proteolytic activity. To facilitate purification, Ste24p was tagged at its NH2 terminus with 10 histidine residues. A triply iterated HA epitope links the His tag to Ste24p and permits immunodetection. The mating defect of a ste24Δstrain is rescued to the same extent with plasmids expressing either wild-type Ste24p or Ste24-His-HAN, indicating that the tag does not disrupt Ste24p function in vivo. 2A. Tam and S. Michaelis, unpublished data. For the purification of histidine-tagged Ste24p, a detergent-solubilized yeast extract was prepared and subjected to nickel chelate chromatography. Fractions collected during a typical purification of Ste24p-His-HAN were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and silver staining (Fig. 3 A). This purification procedure yields a single species (>95% purity) of ∼60 kDa (Fig. 3 A, lanes 6–7), which is immunoreactive with anti-HA and anti-Ste24p antibodies, is absent from a mock purification using a strain lacking Ste24p (ste24Δ), and is consistent with the calculated molecular mass of Ste24p-His-HAN (55 kDa).2 Ste24p represents ∼0.5% of the total protein in the starting lysate. 3W. K. Schmidt and S. Michaelis, unpublished data. Approximately 10–15% of the Ste24p in the starting lysate (Fig. 3 A,lane 1) was recovered in the elution fractions (Fig. 3 A, lanes 6 and 7) as determined by immunoblot analysis.3 Fractions from the purification were assayed for CAAXproteolytic activity using the bioassay described above. We observed a 40-fold increase in specific activity upon comparison of the total starting lysate (T) and the peak elution (E2) fractions (Fig. 3 B). As expected, 1,10-orthophenanthroline inhibited all of the measurable CAAX proteolytic activity in these fractions.2 Overall, these data provide stro"
https://openalex.org/W2068610116,"cGMP has long been suspected to play a role in synaptic plasticity, but the inaccessibility of nerve terminals to electrical recording has impeded tests of this hypothesis. In posterior pituitary nerve terminals, nitric oxide enhanced Ca2+-activated K+ channel activity by activating guanylate cyclase and PKG. This enhancement occured only at depolarized potentials, so the spike threshold remained unaltered but the afterhyperpolarization became larger. During spike trains, the enhanced afterhyperpolarization promoted Na+ channel recovery from inactivation, thus reducing action potential failures and allowing more Ca2+ to enter. Activating guanylate cyclase, either with applied nitric oxide, or with physiological stimulation to activate nitric oxide synthase, increased action potential firing. Thus, the cGMP/nitric oxide cascade generates a short-term, use-dependent enhancement of release."

In the absence of oxygen, FNR is in its active form and binds to specific DNA sites to either activate or repress transcription of target genes (for a review see Refs. 1Guest J.R. Green J. Irvine A.S. Spiro S. Lin E.C.C. Lynch A.S. Regulation of Gene Expression in Escherichia coli. Chapman & Hall, New York1996: 317-342Crossref Google Scholar and 2Patschkowski T. Bates D.M. Kiley P.J. Storz G. Hengee-Aronis R. Bacterial Stress Response. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.2000: 61-78Google Scholar). A novel feature of FNR is that its DNA binding activity is associated with its ability to dimerize, a property regulated by the presence of an O2-labile [4Fe-4S] cluster (3Lazazzera B. Bates D.

When the protein contains a [4Fe-4S] cluster, FNR forms homodimers in solution (4Lazazzera B.A. Beinert H. Khoroshilova N. Kennedy M.C. Kiley P.J. J. Biol.

A. 1997; 94: 6087-6092Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). However, when O2 is present, the [4Fe-4S] clusters are destroyed, and the ability of FNR to dimerize is decreased, therefore reducing its site-specific DNA binding and abolishing its ability to control transcription (5Khoroshilova N.

Thus, for FNR, DNA binding and dimerization appear to be tightly coupled processes that provide a mechanism for controlling transcription of specific genes in response to changes in O2 levels. The molecular interactions that promote dimerization of FNR are unknown because there is currently no structural information for this protein. Nevertheless, amino acid residues 140–159 of FNR have been proposed to function in subunit-subunit interactions because the position of these residues corresponds to the α-helix along which the closely relatedE. coli transcription factor, the cAMP receptor protein (CRP),1 dimerizes via a coiled coil interaction (4Lazazzera B.A. Beinert H.

Biol. 1987; 198: 311-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). Consistent with this region having a role in FNR subunit-subunit interactions, substitution of Asp-154 to Ala (Fig. 1) increases FNR dimerization in the absence of a [4Fe-4S] cluster (3Lazazzera B. Bates D. Kiley P.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1993-2005Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 8Kiley P.J. Reznikoff W.S. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 16-22Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the function of other residues within this putative dimerization domain has not been investigated. In addition, the amino acid side chains of CRP and FNR are not highly conserved in this region (9Shaw D.J. Rice D.W. Guest J.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 166: 241-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), raising the issue of whether this region of FNR will have unique features to attain regulated dimerization. The role of the [4Fe-4S] cluster in promoting subunit-subunit interactions is even less well understood. The [4Fe-4S] cluster is ligated by three Cys residues located within the N-terminal end of FNR, a region that is absent in CRP. The fourth ligand of the cluster (Cys-122) is predicted to fall within a proposed β-roll structure of FNR (10Melville S.B. Gunsalus R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18733-18736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Sharrocks A.D. Green J. Guest J.R. FEBS Lett. 1990; 270: 119-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 12Bates D. Lazzazzera B. Kiley P.J. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 3972-3978Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that precedes the putative dimerization domain (Fig. 1). Given the location of these four cysteine residues, the [4Fe-4S] cluster of FNR is not expected to be very close to the dimerization helix (13Kiley P.J. Beinert H. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1999; 22: 341-352Crossref Google Scholar). Thus, it is an open question as to how the presence of a [4Fe-4S] cluster facilitates subunit-subunit interactions within FNR. To understand the molecular interactions that promote FNR dimerization, we have examined the role of residues 140–159 of FNR. Alanine scanning mutagenesis was initially used to identify residues of this region required for FNR activity in vivo. Size exclusion chromatography and Fe-S cluster analysis was subsequently used to characterize the in vitro properties of representative mutant proteins. Our findings suggest that residues 140–159 define a dimerization domain of FNR. In addition, the properties of these mutant FNR proteins support the notion that the [4Fe-4S] cluster of FNR promotes subunit interactions by altering the monomer-dimer equilibrium. Plasmids and strains are listed in Table I. Single alanine substitutions in the dimerization helix (residues 140–159) were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis of pPK821 using oligonucleotide primers (Operon Technologies) as described previously (3Lazazzera B. Bates D. Kiley P.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1993-2005Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Alanine mutants with a second alanine substitution at Asp-154 were constructed in the same manner except using pPK822 (3Lazazzera B. Bates D. Kiley P.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1993-2005Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) as the starting template. The FNR coding sequence of the pPK821 or pPK822 derivatives was cloned into pET-11a using the NdeI and BamHI restriction sites. For some mutants, the fnr gene with the normal fnr promoter region was cloned into pACYC184 using the HindIII and BamHI restriction sites. Thefnr gene of each plasmid was sequenced using either a33P thermosequenase terminator cycle sequencing kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) or a Big Dye sequencing kit at the University of Wisconsin Biotechnology facility to verify the presence of only the introduced mutation.Table IStrains and plasmids used in this studyStrain or plasmidRelevant genotypeRef.E. coli strains RZ8480lacZΔ145 ΔfnrΩSpr/Smr3Lazazzera B.

Thus, the low levels of protein expressed from these plasmids would avoid masking of potential dimerization defects at higher protein concentrations that would result if expressed from its own promoter on this plasmid. Additionally, because FNR synthesis is not under the control of its own promoter, these constructs have the added benefit of avoiding any differences in protein concentration that might arise through a defect in negative autoregulation of FNR synthesis (14Spiro S. Guest J. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1987; 133: 3279-3288PubMed Google Scholar, 15Pascal M.-C. Bonnefoy V. Fons M. Chippaux M. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1986; 36: 35-39Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar). We also assayed the activity of some mutant proteins at higher protein concentrations by using pACYC184-derived plasmids. FNR protein produced from the pACYC184-WTfnr construct was 3–5 times higher in concentration than that produced from WT fnr on the chromosome (data not shown). FNR activity was determined by assaying β-galactosidase activity from cultures of E. coli strains (see Table I) that havelacZ under the transcriptional control of either thenarG, dmsA, or ndh promoter as described previously (3Lazazzera B. Bates D. Kiley P.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1993-2005Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Cell cultures were grown under anaerobic conditions in M9 minimal medium containing 0.2% glucose, and ampicillin (25 μg/ml) or chloramphenicol (20 μg/ml) was added to the media when the strain contained either pET-11a or pACYC184 derived plasmids, respectively. In addition, 1.4 mm potassium nitrate was added to the media when assaying expression ofnarG with the pET-11a plasmids to stimulate phosphorylation of the coactivator, NarL (16Lee A.I. Delgado A. Gunsalus R.P. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 5309-5316Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Whereas the trends observed both with and without nitrate are the same, the increased levels of β-galactosidase observed in the presence of nitrate allowed us to better distinguish those mutants that retained some activity over that found in the absence of FNR. FNR was purified from cells overexpressing mutant or WT FNR under anaerobic conditions as described previously (17Bates D.M. Popescu C.V. Khoroshilova N. Vogt K. Beinert H. Münck E. Kiley P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6234-6240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The iron and S2− occupancy of each preparation was evaluated using procedures from Kennedy et al. (18Kennedy M.C. Kent T.A. Emptage M. Merkle H. Beinert H. Münck E. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 14463-14471Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Beinert (19Beinert H. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 131: 373-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar), respectively. Size exclusion chromatography was performed on a Amersham Pharmacia Biotech HR-12 Superose column (10 × 300 mm) attached to a Beckman high pressure liquid chromatography system enclosed within a Coy anaerobic chamber with an atmosphere of 90% N2, 5% CO2, and 5% H2. The elution experiments were performed in 50 mmKPO4 (pH 6.8), 400 mm KCl, and 10% glycerol at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. The FNR samples were injected in 200-μl aliquots at a concentration of [4Fe-4S] FNR protein ranging from 5 to 40 μm. The absorption profile of the eluent was continuously monitored from 200 to 600 nm using a photodiode array detector (Beckman 168 System Gold). The column was calibrated with cytochrome c, bovine serum albumin, and carbonic anhydrase. Absorption spectra (600–200 nm) of the mutant proteins (5–10 μm) in 50 mm KPO4 (pH 6.8) and 400 mm KCl were obtained in sealed quartz cuvettes (1-cm pathlength) on a PerkinElmer Life Sciences Lambda2 spectrometer. Circular dichroism spectra over a range of 300–198 nm were taken in 1-mm sealed quartz cuvettes in an Aviv model 202SF CD spectropolarimeter. The protein samples were 5 μm FNR in a buffer of 50 mmKPO4 (pH 6.8) and 100 mm KCl. Each spectrum was recorded in 1 nm wavelength increments, and the signal was acquired for 3 s at each wavelength. Amino acid residues 140–159 of FNR are analogous to the residues of the CRP C-helix that promotes subunit interactions through formation of a coiled coil. To test if this 20-amino acid region performs an analogous function in FNR, we examined the effect of replacing each residue with Ala on FNR function in vivo. If our hypothesis is correct, we would predict that at a minimum, Ala substitution of hydrophobic residues with a spacing typical of a coiled coil interaction (3–4 residues apart) should decrease FNR activity. FNR activity was assessed by measuring the level of β-galactosidase from anaerobically grown strains containing lacZ under control of the FNR-dependent narG promoter (P narG). For this analysis, pET-11a containing fnror its mutant derivatives cloned behind the T7 promoter were utilized because in the absence of T7 RNA polymerase, we found that FNR levels produced from this plasmid do not exceed single copy levels of FNR (data not shown). The majority of the amino acid substitutions that were found to decrease FNR activity contained an Ala in place of a hydrophobic residue (FNR-M143A, FNR-M144A, FNR-L146A, FNR-M147A, FNR-I151A, FNR-M157A, and FNR-I158A; Fig.2 a). In addition, when two charged residues were replaced by Ala (FNR-R140A and FNR-R145A) FNR activity was also reduced. Many of the residues that were found to be important for FNR activity are spaced three to four residues apart (Arg-140, Met-144, Met-147, Ile-151, and Ile-158), suggesting that they fall on the same side of an α-helix (Fig. 2 b; the residues of the helix are fitted to a coiled coil model; see “Discussion”). Similar results were observed using strains containing lacZfused to another FNR-dependent promoter, PdmsA(data not shown) indicating that the phenotypes of these mutant proteins are not promoter-specific. Western blot analysis demonstrated that the mutant proteins are present at levels similar to that of wild type (data not shown), indicating that none of these defects can be simply attributed to differences in FNR levels. To test if the defects of the Ala substitution mutants resulted from altered subunit-subunit interactions, representative proteins (FNR-M147A, FNR-I151A, and FNR-I158A) were isolated anaerobically and characterized. The visible spectra (Fig.3) of the mutant proteins were shown to have an absorption band centered at 410 nm that is characteristic of a [4Fe-4S] cluster (5Khoroshilova N. Popescu C. Munck E. Beinert H. Kiley P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6087-6092Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). In addition, the amount of iron and S2− in the protein preparations was quantified to determine whether the occupancy of the [4Fe-4S] cluster in the mutant proteins was similar to that of WT-FNR. This analysis showed that 50, 70, and 80% of isolated FNR-M147A, FNR-I151A, and FNR-I158A, respectively, contained a [4Fe-4S] cluster, which is within the range of 50–85% normally observed with WT-FNR (17Bates D.M.

Taken together, these data suggest that the mutant proteins contain a [4Fe-4S] cluster at levels similar to that of WT-FNR. To access directly whether any of the mutant proteins had defects in dimerization, size exclusion chromatography of isolated proteins was carried out under anaerobic conditions. To distinguish the elution profile of the clusterless FNR (apoFNR) from the [4Fe-4S] form, the absorption profile of the column eluate was monitored on line from 200 to 600 nm. As expected for WT FNR protein (4Lazazzera B.A. Beinert H. Khoroshilova N. Kennedy M.C. Kiley P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2762-2768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar) the elution profile showed that the [4Fe-4S] cluster species (410 nm; Fig.4, solid line) had an elution time (26.8 min) expected of a dimer, whereas the species lacking any cluster was eluted in the monomeric fraction (28.7 min; compare the 222 nm (dashed line) versus 410 nm (solid line) in Fig. 4). Furthermore, at all column onput concentrations tested (5–20 μm), all of the [4Fe-4S] WT-FNR eluted as a dimer (Fig. 5 a).Figure 5Size exclusion chromatography of WT-FNR, FNR-M147A, FNR-I151A, and FNR-I158A at varying protein concentrations.

For example, at a concentration of 20 μm [4Fe-4S] FNR-I158A, the majority of the [4Fe-4S] form of FNR-I158A eluted as a dimer (Fig. 5 c, solid line) similar to WT-FNR. However, as the loading concentration of FNR-I158A was decreased to 10 (Fig. 5 c, dashed line) or 7 μm (Fig. 5 c, dotted line), the elution times broadened and shifted toward the monomeric species. A similar behavior was observed with FNR-M147A (Fig. 5 b) except that at 20 μm [4Fe-4S] FNR-M147A, the elution time of the [4Fe-4S] form was already intermediate between that of a monomer and a dimer (Fig. 5 b, solid line), indicating a slightly greater dimerization defect than FNR-I158A. The concentration dependence of the elution profiles and the non-symmetrical and broad nature of the peaks suggest that some fraction of the dimeric [4Fe-4S] mutant protein population was dissociating as it moved through the column. These data indicate that replacement of Met-147 and Ile-158 with Ala decreases but does not eliminate FNR dimer formation. In comparison, FNR-I151A had a more severe defect because the majority of I151A-FNR eluted largely as a monomer up to an onput concentration of 20 μm [4Fe-4S] protein (Fig. 5 d). This monomer species had a visible absorption spectrum characteristic of a [4Fe-4S] protein, indicating that a [4Fe-4S] cluster can be found in the FNR protein even when the protein is not a dimer. Because FNR-I151A did not appear to dimerize well at even very high concentrations of protein, we evaluated the overall structural features of this protein by comparing the CD of the protein bands of FNR-I151A and WT-FNR. As shown in Fig. 6, the CD spectra of the two proteins are almost identical, suggesting that the substitution did not cause a major change in the secondary structure of the protein. There is a small decrease in the ratio of the band at 208 nm versus the band at 220 nm, which may be attributed to the fact that the WT can form a dimer, whereas under these conditions I151A does not. Thus, taken together, the in vitro data suggest that the in vivo phenotypes of FNR-M147A, FNR-I151A, and FNR-I158A are most easily explained by specific defects in dimerization. Because thein vitro data indicated that dimerization of FNR is reduced but not abolished by some Ala substitutions of the dimerization domain, we tested whether higher cellular concentrations of the mutant proteins would increase the amount of FNR activity in vivo. Western blot analysis showed that at least 20-fold higher protein levels were achieved by expressing mutant and WT-FNR from a multicopy plasmid (pACYC184) under control of the normal fnr promoter region than by expressing the proteins from pET-11a (data not shown). The amount of β-galactosidase activity measured from anaerobically grown strains containing lacZ under control of the FNR-dependent narG promoter (P narG), with FNR supplied from a pACYC184 plasmid, showed that, at these higher protein levels, most of the FNR mutants (R140A, M143A, R145A, L146A, M147A, and I158A) activated transcription at a level similar to WT-FNR (Fig. 7 a). Such a result is most easily explained if the overall effect of the Ala substitutions is to decrease a FNR monomer-dimer equilibrium. Then, by mass action, producing FNR mutant proteins at a higher level increases the amount of dimeric FNR protein to levels sufficient to fully occupy the promoter. However, two mutants, FNR-M157A and FNR-I151A, only activated P narG to 30 and 40% of WT-FNR under comparable conditions (Fig. 7 a), respectively, suggesting that the in vivo defect cannot be totally overcome by these increased protein levels. In the case of FNR-I151A, we found that this protein was also defective in repression of P ndh (Fig. 7 b) at these FNR levels indicating that the in vivo phenotype reflected a decrease in DNA binding (20Spiro S. Roberts R.E. Guest J.R. Mol. Microbiol. 1989; 3: 601-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), an outcome expected for a dimerization defect. The partial restoration of FNR-I151A activity indicates that some dimeric FNR-I151A protein must form but not at levels sufficient to saturate the FNR sites at the respective promoters. This result is consistent with the large defect in dimerization observed by size exclusion chromatography implying that the monomer-dimer equilibrium is perturbed the most in FNR-I151A. In contrast, the properties of FNR-M157A could be most easily explained by a defect in transcription activation because FNR-M157A repressed P ndh as well as WT-FNR and the other mutants that fully activated P narG (Fig.7 b), indicating that the ability of FNR-M157A to dimerize and bind DNA is not defective. This conclusion is supported by the fact that size exclusion analysis of the isolated FNR-M157A protein showed that this mutant dimerized as well as WT-FNR at an onput concentration of 5 μm (data not shown). If FNR dimerizes via a coiled coil interaction (see “Discussion”), then Asp-154 is predicted to be on the same side of an α-helix as many of the hydrophobic residues that we found to be important for FNR activity (Fig. 2 b). However, negatively charged residues like aspartate are rarely found at a coiled coil subunit interface because the carboxylate group would make the interaction energetically unfavorable. Thus, it was possible that Asp-154 may actually weaken interactions between the hydrophobic side chains within the dimerization interface of FNR. To test this hypothesis, we determined whether removing the negative charge at 154 would improve the activity of FNR proteins that had a defect in dimerization. Indeed, we found that replacement of Asp-154 for Ala in FNR-R140A, FNR-M143A, FNR-M144A, FNR-M147A, and FNR-I158A increased β-galactosidase activity under anaerobic conditions to greater than 70% of WT FNR levels (Table II). Additionally, replacement of Asp-154 with Ala in the FNR-I151A mutant increased levels over 30-fold compared with just FNR-I151A. In contrast, replacement of Asp-154 for Ala in any of the mutants containing Ala substitutions of residues proposed to be outside of the interface (FNR-L146A-D154A, FNR-R145A-D154A, and FNR-M157A-D154A) showed 50% or less of WT FNR activity, similar to what was found when Asp was present at position 154 (Table II). This lack of recovery is similar to what was observed when the D154A substitution was assayed in combination with substitutions that cause defects in either DNA binding (3Lazazzera B. Bates D. Kiley P.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1993-2005Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) or transcription activation (21Lamberg K.E. Kiley P.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 38: 817-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In addition, the Ala substitutions that did not cause large decreases in FNR activity showed only slight increases in activity when the D154A substitution was included. Therefore, removal of the carboxyl group at position 154 preferentially improves the activity of the mutants containing Ala substitutions proposed to be at the dimer interface. A simple interpretation of this observation is that Asp-154 is also present at the dimerization interface in WT FNR but has an inhibitory role.Table IIFNR activity of single alanine mutants and their D154A counterpartsFNR substitutionnarG-lacZ expression2-aExperimental conditions are the same as in Fig. 2 a.

Rev. 1999; 22: 341-352Crossref Google Scholar), we know very little about the protein-protein interactions that promote dimerization. To begin to address this issue, we analyzed the in vivo and in vitro properties of FNR mutants containing alanine substitutions along a putative dimerization helix. Assuming residues 140–159 of FNR form an α-helix like its counterpart in CRP, our simplest interpretation of the properties of these mutants is that this region promotes subunit interactions by forming a largely hydrophobic dimerization interface. A small patch of residues located on the opposite face of this putative α-helix was also found to be important for FNR activity and may indicate a second f"

MtaN (multidrug transporter activation, N terminus), another MerR family member, is a global activator ofB. subtilis multidrug transporter genes and constitutively activates transcription of bmr and blt, another putative membrane protein gene (ydfK) and its own gene (13Baranova N.N.

BmrR binds toxic lipophilic cations, although physiologically relevant ligand(s) of BmrR have yet to be identified (10Ahmed M. Borsch C.M. Taylor S.S. Vazquez-Laslop N. Neyfakh A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28506-28513Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). TipAL covalently binds the large antibiotic thiostrepton (19Holmes D.J. Caso J.L. Thompson C.J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3183-3191Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Whereas MtaN is able to activate transcription of multidrug transporters and full-length Mta is closely related (40% sequence identity) to TipAL, Mta is not induced by thiostrepton (13Baranova N.N. Danchin A. Neyfakh A.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 1549-1559Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), and the ligand or ligands of Mta remain unknown.The N-terminal domain of each MerR subunit, the most conserved segment, contains a winged helix-turn-helix motif (20Shewchuk L.M. Helmann J.D. Ross W. Park S.J. Summers A.O. Walsh C.T. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 2340-2344Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and the dimerization region, which comprises half of an antiparallel coiled-coil (21Caguiat J.J. Watson A.L. Summers A.O. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 3462-3471Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This ∼110-residue domain is the signature of the MerR family, and it is likely to be structurally and functionally conserved. Beyond the winged helix-turn-helix motif, there appears to be no significant sequence or structural homology between MerR family members and other known gene regulators. The variable length C-terminal domain of MerR proteins contains ligand or coactivator binding elements that have been tailored to recognize their widely divergent and non-overlapping signals. Not surprisingly, the larger proteins bind larger coactivators, whereas the smaller proteins appear to be the minimum size necessary to respond to a divalent cation.The function of the C terminus is to modulate the transcriptional activation of MerR family members by keeping the protein/DNA complex in a transcriptionally inactive form until a coactivator is bound, at which time repression is relieved, and the protein is able to up-regulate transcription (13Baranova N.N. Danchin A. Neyfakh A.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 1549-1559Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 22Godsey M.H. Baranova N.N. Neyfakh A.A. Brennan R.G. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2000; 56: 1456-1458Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). MtaN is an unusual MerR family member because the protein lacks this modulation domain, which leads to its constitutive activation of cognate promoters (13Baranova N.N. Danchin A. Neyfakh A.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 1549-1559Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Because MtaN constitutively activates its own transcription, cells containingmtaN produce high levels of this protein through positive feedback. Eventually, elevated levels of MtaN overcome its lower affinities for the bmr and blt promoters, and those genes are activated (13Baranova N.N. Danchin A. Neyfakh A.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 1549-1559Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). MtaN appears to represent the smallest active form of the MerR family of transcriptional regulators.An unusual feature of the genes that are regulated by MerR family members is the 19-base pair (bp) separation of the −10 and −35 promoter elements (23Parkhill J. Brown N.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 5157-5162Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), which is 17 bp in most bacterial promoters (24Helmann J.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 2351-2360Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar,25McClure W.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 171-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar). The 19-bp spacer appears to prevent open complex formation by RNA polymerase in the absence of an activator (23Parkhill J. Brown N.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 5157-5162Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). This unusual promoter structure has led to a model of transcription regulation by these proteins in which activation is achieved by DNA distortion and untwisting (12Summers A.O. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 3097-3101Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 26Ansari A.Z. Chael M.L. O'Halloran T.V. Nature. 1992; 355: 87-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The recent crystal structure of BmrR bound to DNA and coactivator has delineated a significant portion of the activation mechanism (27Zheleznova-Heldwein E.E. Brennan R.G. Nature. 2001; 409: 378-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). The ternary complex shows that the center of the DNA-binding site is bent, untwisted, and bunched-up, shortening the effective length of the DNA and reconfiguring the RNA polymerase binding sites to resemble more closely a 17-bp spacer and allow open complex formation.The BmrR-drug-DNA complex provides insight into one facet of transcription regulation by the MerR family. However, the extent of the conformational changes of these proteins needed to effect DNA binding and transcription activation, if any, are unknown. To address this aspect of the mechanism of MerR family transcription activation, we solved the crystal structure of MtaN to 2.75 Å resolution. Comparison of the structures of MtaN and DNA/drug-bound BmrR reveals their overall structural similarity, as well as significant tertiary and quaternary differences.

Mutants lacking the SOD1 polypeptide (sod1Δ) andlys7Δ yeast show very similar phenotypes, namely poor growth in air and aerobic auxotrophies for lysine and methionine. Here, we demonstrate certain phenotypic differences between these strains: 1)lys7Δ cells are slightly less sensitive to paraquat thansod1Δ cells, 2) EPR-detectable or “free” iron is dramatically elevated in sod1Δ mutants but not inlys7Δ yeast, and 3) although sod1Δ mutants show increased sensitivity to extracellular zinc, thelys7Δ strain is as resistant as wild type. To restore the SOD catalytic activity but not the zinc-binding capability of the SOD1 polypeptide, we overexpressed Mn-SOD from Bacillus stearothermophilus in the cytoplasm of sod1Δ yeast. Paraquat resistance was restored to wild-type levels, but zinc was not. Conversely, expression of a mutant CuZn-SOD that binds zinc but has no SOD activity (H46C) restored zinc resistance but not paraquat resistance. Taken together, these results strongly suggest that CuZn-SOD, in addition to its antioxidant properties, plays a role in zinc homeostasis.

With the appearance of molecular oxygen (O2) in the earth's atmosphere, all aerobic organisms evolved methods to utilize O2 for energy production. However, reactive byproducts of O2 metabolism (also known as reactive oxygen species) can be deleterious, and aerobic life forms have developed several systems to combat metabolic and environmental sources of oxygen toxicity. One major constituent in protecting cellular components against reactive oxygen species is superoxide dismutase (SOD).1 As a part of the primary line of defense against reactive oxygen species, SODs use metal ions to catalyze the disproportionation of superoxide (O⨪2) to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and O2 (1Fridovich I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 97-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (2731) Google Scholar). Eukaryotes, including Saccharomyces cerevisiae, contain two distinct SOD enzymes. Mn-SOD, encoded by the SOD2 gene, resides in the mitochondrial matrix; CuZn-SOD, encoded by the SOD1 gene, is localized mainly in the cytoplasm and nucleus as well as in the mitochondrial intermembrane space. Mutant derivatives of S. cerevisiae that lack either of the SODs exhibit phenotypic deficiencies which are particularly extreme in the sod1Δ mutants. Even though they are viable, sod1Δ strains grow poorly in air, are extremely sensitive to redox-cycling drugs, die quickly in the stationary phase, and display aerobic lysine and methionine auxotrophies. It is generally believed that the loss of superoxide-scavenging activity, which is due to the absence ofSOD1 gene product, leads to a serious burden of oxidative stress and causes havoc in cellular metabolism and growth processes (2Gralla E.B. Kosman D.J. Adv. Genet. 1992; 30: 251-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar,3Gralla E.B. Valentine J.S. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 5918-5920Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Employing in vivo whole-cell Fe(III) EPR methodology, Keyer and Imlay (4Keyer K. Imlay J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13635-13640Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar) observed an increase in loosely bound or “free” iron 2It should be noted that there is no such chemical entity as free iron in an intracellular environment; it would most certainly exist only in complexes with other as yet undefined cellular components. We use “free” iron in quotes to indicate this fact. in sodmutants of E. coli. This iron is present in the Fe(II) state, as evidenced by the fact that it is only detectable by EPR at g = 4.3 after treatment of the cells with the iron chelator desferrioxamine, which converts EPR-silent Fe(II) to EPR-detectable Fe(III). A potential source of this increased pool of “free” iron includes a class of enzymes containing exposed [4Fe-4S] clusters, which are superoxide-sensitive (5Liochev S.I. Fridovich I. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1994; 16: 29-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). The classic example of this type of enzyme is aconitase (6Flint D.H. Allen R.M. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 2315-2334Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Attack by O⨪2 oxidizes the [4Fe-4S] cluster, resulting in the release of at least one iron ion and inactivation of the enzyme. In E. coli, this process was proposed to be the source of the “free” iron that built up in mutants lacking SOD (4Keyer K. Imlay J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13635-13640Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar). Recently, adapting the same EPR method, we demonstrated that yeast sod1Δ mutants also have greatly elevated levels of “free” or “EPR-detectable” iron (iron detectable at g = 4.3 by EPR). In yeast, unlike in E. coli, the iron is present in the Fe(III) state (7Srinivasan C. Liba A. Imlay J.A. Valentine J.S. Gralla E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29187-29192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Studies of yeast mutants lacking the SOD1 gene (sod1Δ) have revealed intriguing links connecting CuZn-SOD with transition metal metabolism. Addition of manganese or copper salts to the medium in modest amounts can improve the growth of these strains (reviewed in Ref. 8Gralla E.B. Scandalios J. Oxidative Stress and the Molecular Biology of Antioxidant Defenses. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1997: 495-525Google Scholar). More recently, we have shown thatsod1Δ yeast have an increased requirement for iron in aerobic growth, and under certain growth conditions, they display a moderate increase in iron uptake and accumulation (9De Freitas J.M.

Moreover, a variety of second site genetic suppressors of the sod1Δ phenotype have been isolated (10Liu X.F. Elashvili I. Gralla E.B. Valentine J.S. Lapinskas P. Culotta V.C. J. Biol.

Out of this scientific endeavor has also come the discovery of the copper chaperone for SOD1 (CCS). This protein is responsible for the delivery of copper to CuZn-SOD and is encoded by the LYS7gene in S. cerevisiae (14Culotta V.C. Klomp L.W. Strain J. Casareno R.L. Krems B. Gitlin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23469-23472Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar, 15Gamonet F. Lauquin G.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 251: 716-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Because the SOD1 polypeptide in lys7Δ mutants lacks copper in its active site, it is incompetent to catalyze the removal of O⨪2. lys7Δ and sod1Δ strains exhibit very similar phenotypic defects (including poor growth in air and aerobic auxotrophies for methionine and lysine), but they are not identical, as we report here. Certain differences exist between these two mutant derivatives, most notably the following two characteristics: 1) sod1Δ mutants display a 5-fold increase in the levels of EPR-detectable iron relative to lys7Δ and wild-type yeast and 2) sod1Δ mutants are sensitive to zinc while lys7Δ yeast are not. These dissimilarities strongly suggest an in vivo role forSOD1 in metal metabolism, and we have provided further evidence that the SOD1 polypeptide may play a role in cellular resistance to elevated levels of zinc ions. High purity sulfate salts of zinc, copper, and nickel were obtained from Sigma. Methyl viologen, commonly known as paraquat, and the antibiotic G418 were also purchased from Sigma. The yeast strains used in this study are described in Table I. Strains BY4741, JW202, and JW203 were purchased from Research Genetics (Huntsville, AL). The lys7Δ strain JW101 was obtained by deleting the chromosomal LYS7 locus of EG103 using thelys7::LEU2 construct pSL2527 as described previously (16Horecka J. Kinsey P.T. Sprague Jr., G.F. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 162: 87-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Using oursod1Δ::URA3 construct, JW102 (lys7Δsod1Δ) was prepared by sequential gene deletion starting with the lys7Δ strain. Southern blot analysis was performed to verify the correct deletion of theLYS7 and SOD1 genes (data not shown). The plasmids pEMBLyex4 and pSALSOD1 (referred to herein as pMn-SOD and carrying the Bacillus stearothermophilus gene for Mn-SOD) were kindly provided by Dr. C. Bowler (17Bowler C. Van Kaer L. Van Camp W. Van Montagu M. Inze D. Dhaese P. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 1539-1546Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and introduced into JW201 (the sod1 null yeast in the BY4741 background) by lithium acetate transformation (18Kaiser C. Michaelis S. Mitchell A. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994Google Scholar) to create strains JW203 and JW204. EG118 (sod1Δ) yeast cells were transformed with YEp351, YEp600, or YEp351-yH46C to yield strains HH101, HH102, or HH103, respectively. YEp351 is a yeast multicopy shuttle vector with a LEU2 selectable marker (19Hill J.E. Myers A.M. Koerner T.J. Tzagoloff A. Yeast. 1986; 2: 163-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (1082) Google Scholar). YEp600 contains a 1.1-kilobase genomic fragment containing the wild-type SOD1 gene with its own promoter and carrying an engineered NcoI site at the translation start site (20Nishida C.R. Gralla E.B. Valentine J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9906-9910Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). YEp351-yH46C was generated by inserting the yH46C fragment (NcoI-SmaI) from pGEM-3Zf(+)-yH46C (21Lu Y. Roe J.A. Bender C.J. Peisach J. Banci L. Bertini I. Gralla E.B. Valentine J.S.

Yeast with plasmids were cultured in the appropriate dropout medium (SD-Leu for HH101, HH102, and HH103 and SD-Ura or SGal-Ura for JW203 and JW204). SDC medium was composed as described (18Kaiser C. Michaelis S. Mitchell A. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994Google Scholar) except that the supplements Leu, His, Trp, Met, Ura, and Ade were increased 4-fold. Overnight startup cultures were grown from a single colony in the same type of medium that was used for further growth except when the medium contained galactose. For growth in galactose-containing medium, the startup culture in glucose was washed twice with sterile water prior to inoculation in galactose-containing medium. For EPR studies, EG103, EG118, JW101, and JW102 were seeded at an optical density at 600 nm (A600) of 0.1 in 50 ml of SDC medium and grown for 72 h at 30 °C. After growth, cells were centrifuged and then briefly treated with desferrioxamine, which binds to labile iron and converts it from Fe(II) (EPR-silent) to Fe(III) prior to washing with 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4. After washing, the pellet was resuspended in 200 μl of 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, containing 20% glycerol, and 200 μl of the resuspended cells was packed in EPR tubes. The tubes were stored at −70 °C until EPR measurements were performed. EPR spectra were recorded using a Bruker X-band spectrometer using a finger Dewar filled with liquid nitrogen attached to the cavity of the instrument to maintain low temperature. Parameters used for low temperature Fe(III) EPR were as follows: center field, 1500 G; sweep width, 500 G; microwave power, 20 milliwatts; attenuation, 10 dB; modulation amplitude, 20.2 G; modulation frequency, 100 kHz. Further details regarding sample preparation, instrument parameters, and data analysis used for the whole-cell low temperature Fe(III) EPR measurements are delineated in our previous study (7Srinivasan C. Liba A. Imlay J.A. Valentine J.S. Gralla E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29187-29192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Paraquat, zinc, copper, or nickel was added to the indicated medium at the indicated concentration. Experimental cultures in dextrose-containing medium were inoculated at an A600 of 0.03 to 0.05. Experimental cultures in medium containing galactose were seeded at an A600 of 0.05 to 0.07. To evaluate the effect of excess zinc ion, the starting pH of the growth medium was at 4 instead of 6 to prevent the precipitation of zinc as zinc hydroxide at pH 6. (This pH change had no obvious effect on growth. Data not shown.) Cultures were grown at 30 °C with shaking at 200 rpm for a maximum of 24 h. Total cell growth was determined by measuring turbidity at A600. AnA600 of 1 indicates a culture density of 1 × 107 cells/ml. Cells were grown as described above. Typically, duplicate samples containing 15 to 20 × 107 cells from 25-ml stationary phase cultures were harvested by centrifugation. The cell pellets were washed once in 5 ml of 10 mm EDTA, pH 8, followed by three washes in 5 ml of metal-free water. The final cell pellets were resuspended in 1 ml of 10% ultrapure nitric acid, and digestion was allowed to take place at 98 °C for 18 h. After complete digestion, 950 μl was diluted to 7 ml in metal-free water, and these samples were analyzed using a Thermo-Jarrel Ash Iris 1000 inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometer. lys7Δ yeast have normal SOD1 expression, but the SOD1 polypeptide lacks enzymatic activity because the copper is not incorporated into the active site (14Culotta V.C. Klomp L.W. Strain J. Casareno R.L. Krems B. Gitlin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23469-23472Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar, 15Gamonet F. Lauquin G.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 251: 716-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Therefore, one would expectlys7Δ and sod1Δ strains to possess comparable antioxidant capacity and thus to share similar phenotypes. With thelys7Δ and sod1Δ strains constructed from our laboratory wild-type yeast (EG103 background), we have observed numerous similarities between these two strains, such as slow growth, aerobic auxotrophies for lysine and methionine, poor growth in the presence of non-fermentable carbon source, and temperature sensitivity at 37 °C. However, further characterization of the lys7null strain led to the discovery of certain differences between these two yeast mutants. First, we examined the effect of paraquat, a known generator of intracellular superoxide, on wild-type,lys7Δ, sod1Δ, andlys7Δsod1Δ yeast by culturing cells in the presence of varying concentrations of paraquat for 24 h. As shown in Fig. 1 A, at 10 and 25 μm of paraquat, concentrations that are toxic for bothsod1Δ and lys7Δsod1Δ mutant strains, lys7Δ cells still grew as well as wild-type cells, but 100 μm paraquat was toxic. In contrast, wild-type EG103 can survive in 1 to 10 mm paraquat. Identical experiments were conducted in another genetic background, BY4741, with similar results (Fig. 1 B). In the BY4741 background, lys7Δ cells are resistant to the toxic effects of paraquat at concentrations as high as 100 μm(83.2 ± 2.9% control growth), whereas sod1Δ yeast exhibit significant levels of growth retardation at 25 μm(8.0 ± 4.8% control growth). Because it is postulated that an elevated superoxide level is connected to an increase in cellular “free” iron (4Keyer K. Imlay J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13635-13640Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar, 9De Freitas J.M. Liba A. Meneghini R. Valentine J.S. Gralla E.B. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 27590-27596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), we wonder whether the decreased sensitivity to paraquat for lys7Δ yeast correlated with a diminished level of “free” iron as measured by whole-cell Fe(III) EPR spectroscopy. Wild-type, lys7Δ, sod1Δ, andlys7Δsod1Δ cells were grown to stationary phase (72 h) in SDC, and EPR samples were prepared and evaluated as described under “Experimental Procedures.” As shown in Fig.2, lys7Δ cells had a basal level of EPR-detectable iron of 10.5 ± 3.2 μm, similar to that observed for wild-type yeast. However, the isogenicsod1Δ and lys7Δsod1Δ yeast had levels that were ∼5-fold higher (56.8 ± 14.3 μmand 47.9 ± 6.0 μm, respectively). We also prepared EPR samples of the aforementioned strains without desferrioxamine treatment and observed similar results (data not shown), suggesting that the “free” iron present in all strains was in the ferric state and that the intracellular redox status was similar. Interestingly, in these experiments, elevation of the “free” iron insod1Δ mutants was not accompanied by an increase in the total iron content (see below). One of the more puzzling aspects of the phenotypes of sod1Δ mutants has been their heightened sensitivity to extracellular zinc. We discovered this effect several years ago, and since then, we have sought for an explanation. Wild-type cells tolerate 5 or even 10 mm zinc in the medium (data not shown). On the other hand, cells lacking CuZn-SOD exhibit growth retardation at zinc levels as low as 1 mm. Thus, we decided to assess the ability of excess zinc ions to inhibit growth inlys7Δ yeast as well. In the experiment shown in Fig.3 A, lys7Δ,sod1Δ, lys7Δsod1Δ, and the parental wild-type strain (EG103) were cultured in the presence of increasing concentrations of ZnSO4. Unlike thesod1Δ mutant, which displayed marked growth retardation at 0.5 mm ZnSO4 (∼73% control growth),lys7Δ cells behaved like wild type at all concentrations of ZnSO4 tested (up to 10 mm, Fig. 3 and data not shown). To ascertain that this phenotypic difference betweenlys7Δ and sod1Δ null strains is not a strain-dependent phenomenon, we tested the effect of excess zinc ions on these two mutants made in the BY4741 background. As shown in Fig. 3 B, the resistance of lys7Δ to elevated levels of ZnSO4 mirrored that observed for the EG103 background. In two genetic suppressors of sod1Δ mutants,pmr1 and bsd2, increased sensitivity toward manganese and copper ions was found to correlate with the accumulation of intracellular manganese and copper, respectively (11Liu X.F. Culotta V.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7037-7045Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 12Lapinskas P.J. Cunningham K.W. Liu X.F. Fink G.R. Culotta V.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1382-1388Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, we proceeded to explore whether the sensitivity to excess zinc in thesod1Δ cells was associated with elevated levels of total cellular zinc. The total cellular level of zinc in thesod1Δ mutant was compared with those in isogeniclys7Δ and wild-type strains. In the experiment shown in Fig. 4, zinc levels were measured in cells after 72 h of growth in SDC medium. The sod1Δ, as well as the lys7Δsod1Δ, mutants accumulate ∼50% higher levels of zinc than do the wild-type andlys7Δ strains, further implicating SOD1 in the regulation of heavy metal metabolism. To evaluate the effects of other transition metal ions on wild-type,lys7Δ, and sod1Δ yeast, the growth of these strains was tested in the presence of CuSO4 and NiSO4. As shown in Fig.5 A, the extent of growth inhibition is comparable for all three strains. As has been observed previously, low concentrations of CuSO4 (0.5 mm) enhanced the growth of sod1Δ andlys7Δ mutants, but higher concentrations were equally toxic to mutant and wild-type cells. In medium supplemented with [Ni2+] ranging from 0 to 1.0 mm,lys7Δ and sod1Δ demonstrate similar growth potential (Fig. 5 B). Interestingly, low medium [Ni2+] seemed to have a more pronounced effect on the growth of wild-type (EG103) yeast. It is possible that the weakened antioxidant capacity of lys7 and sod1 null mutants have caused a constitutive up-regulation of various cellular stress genes, thus rendering these cells more resistant to other types of environmental stresses. Overall, the experimental evidence depicted in Fig. 5 suggests that the ability of both lys7Δ andsod1Δ cells to sequester other transition metal ions probably remains intact on a gross level and that the sensitivity ofsod1Δ mutants to excess metal ions is specific to zinc. To assess the relative contributions of the enzymatic superoxide dismutase activity and the zinc binding capacity of CuZn-SOD, we restored the superoxide resistance of sod1Δ yeast by overexpressing a bacterial Mn-SOD in their cytoplasm. Because Mn-SOD is expected to restore SOD activity but not zinc binding capacity in vivo, we were interested to see whether its expression would have any effect on the zinc sensitivity of the sod1Δ mutant. The sod1 null mutant in the BY4741 background was transformed with either pSALSOD (pMn-SOD), a yeast expression vector containing the B. stearothermophilus Mn-SOD gene under the control of the GAL-CYC1 promoter, or pEMBLyex4 (pEMBL), the corresponding vector control (17Bowler C. Van Kaer L. Van Camp W. Van Montagu M. Inze D. Dhaese P. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 1539-1546Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Growth of thesod1Δ/pMn-SOD strain in galactose resulted in the appearance of Mn-SOD activity and loss of the aerobic lysine auxotrophy (data not shown and Ref. 17Bowler C. Van Kaer L. Van Camp W. Van Montagu M. Inze D. Dhaese P. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 1539-1546Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We tested the paraquat sensitivity of the plasmid-containing strains and found thatsod1Δ/pMn-SOD cells behave very much like wild-type yeast, resisting paraquat concentrations as high as 1.0 mm(41.1 ± 11.4% control growth forsod1Δ/pMn-SOD compared with 52.8 ± 2.2% for wild type (WT)), whereas the sod1Δ/pEMBL strain was much more sensitive (Fig. 6 A). Possibly because of the galactose in the medium, somewhat higher levels (0.2 and 0.5 mm) of paraquat are required to cause toxicity in the sod1Δ/pEMBL as compared with the non-plasmid-containing sod1Δ strain. Nevertheless, we can conclude that the prokaryotic Mn-SOD efficiently strengthened the antioxidant capacity of the sod1Δ yeast as evidenced by greatly increased resistance to paraquat, a superoxide-generating chemical. We then tested whether the transformed strains were resistant to zinc (Fig. 6 B). For medium [Zn2+] below 2.0 mm, all four strains behaved similarly (data not shown). Thus, higher concentrations of ZnSO4 than were previously used were required to evaluate the ability of these transformants to resist zinc toxicity, again possibly because of the use of galactose-based medium. As can be seen in Fig. 6 B, expression of cytoplasmic Mn-SOD does not restore zinc resistance to wild-type levels, supporting a role for CuZn-SOD in zinc homeostasis. In a converse experiment, to provide further mechanistic insight into the zinc sensitivity observed in sod1Δ cells, we overexpressed yH46C (a mutant SOD1 protein lacking catalytic activity but capable of binding metal ions) in sod1Δyeast. Growth of the sod1Δ/yH46C strain was tested in medium supplemented with ZnSO4. As shown in Fig.7, sod1Δ/yH46C grew as well as sod1Δ/ySOD1 in the presence of 1.0 and 2.0 mm ZnSO4, but sod1Δ/YEp351 (vector control) exhibited significant growth inhibition at those concentrations. Expression of this mutant SOD had no effect on the resistance to paraquat, confirming that it is catalytically inactive. (At a concentration of 25 μm paraquat, growth ofsod1Δ/yH46C was just 2.1 ± 0.5% control growth.) In this study, we demonstrate that certain differences exist between lys7Δ and sod1Δ yeast.lys7Δ yeast are not as sensitive to the redox-cycling drug paraquat as the sod1Δ mutant, although they are still much less resistant than the isogenic wild-type cells. In addition,lys7Δ cells exhibit wild-type levels of “free” iron as measured by Fe(III) EPR, whereas sod1Δ mutants display a 5-fold increase (Fig. 2). Moreover, the lys7Δ strain grows as well as wild type in elevated zinc, while the sod1Δ strain fails to thrive (Fig. 3). The increased zinc sensitivity of thesod1Δ strain may be due to the fact that it accumulates excess zinc relative to the wild-type and lys7Δ strains (Fig. 4). To explain the phenotypic differences betweensod1Δ and lys7Δ yeast, two different (albeit not mutually exclusive) hypotheses have been considered. The first hypothesis is that the lys7Δ strain retains an extremely small amount of SOD activity, below the detection limit of currently available assays. The second is that the copper-free SOD1 protein, which is present in lys7Δ but not in thesod1Δ strain, plays a role in zinc metabolism either by acting as a depot for zinc ions or through some other mechanism. To distinguish among these possibilities, we performed experiments designed to separate SOD enzymatic activity from the zinc binding activity. We found that cytoplasmic expression of a bacterial Mn-SOD fully restored the paraquat resistance of sod1Δ strains but did not fully restore the zinc sensitivity (Fig. 6). Conversely, expression of H46C, a mutant CuZn-SOD with no enzymatic activity, fully restored zinc resistance (Fig. 7) but had no effect on paraquat resistance. The first hypothesis (that there may be a residual amount of SOD activity in lys7Δ yeast) is supported by the facts that the lys7Δ strains appear slightly more resistant to oxidative stress (e.g. paraquat resistance is a little higher in the lys7Δ mutants than in the sod1Δstrains) and that the zinc sensitivity of sod1Δ strains is only observed in aerobic growth. However, another possible explanation for these phenotypic differences is that paraquat resistance is conferred by superoxide dismutase activity plus some other antioxidant function of the SOD1 polypeptide. For example, inactive apoSOD1 polypeptide might be able to physically protect some vulnerable site(s). (If this is the case, the SOD activity is clearly the more important function because expression of active SOD in the cytoplasm increases paraquat resistance 100-fold or more, while expression of SOD1 made inactive by the absence of Lys7 only increases paraquat resistance a few fold.) The main evidence against the residual activity hypothesis is the fact that SOD activity is undetectable inlys7Δ strains by any assay we have tried. The second hypothesis, which we favor, is that the SOD1 protein plays a role in zinc metabolism or homeostasis. CuZn-SOD is an abundant enzyme, and thus it has the capacity to bind substantial amounts of copper and zinc. CuZn-SOD can help protect against copper toxicity in yeast lacking Cup1 (copper metallothionein) (23Culotta V.C. Joh H.D. Lin S.J. Slekar K.H. Strain J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29991-29997Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). That it participates in protection against zinc toxicity is supported by several pieces of evidence: 1) zinc resistance was lost only when the SOD1 polypeptide was missing (as in the sod1Δ mutant, whether or not it was expressing cytoplasmic Mn-SOD); 2) paraquat resistance was lost only when SOD activity was missing (as in the lys7Δ mutant and the sod1Δ mutant, whether or not they were expressing the inactive H46C mutant SOD; and 3) a null mutation in the yeastSOD2 gene, which encodes the mitochondrial manganese SOD, is not associated with an increased sensitivity toward zinc (data not shown). Therefore, the presence of SOD1 polypeptide, either inactive or enzymatically active, is required to confer zinc tolerance. The simplest explanation is that SOD1 acts as a “zinc sink,” and its absence causes the cell interior to be exposed to levels of zinc in excess of what can be readily tolerated. However, the data showing elevated zinc levels in the sod1Δ strain are puzzling in this regard. It may be that the lack of SOD1 somehow interferes with zinc sensing by Zap1 or with zinc transport or storage, leading to a buildup or mislocalization of zinc stores. We are currently exploring these possibilities experimentally. Another level of complexity is that zinc resistance of thesod1Δ strain was somewhat improved by cytoplasmic expression of the heterologous Mn-SOD, although it was not fully restored. This may indicate that zinc toxicity has an oxidative stress component that is exacerbated when SOD activity is missing. It is possible that this is related to the differences in “free” iron shown in Fig. 2. Alternatively, it may simply be that a SOD-competent cell is better able to defend itself against other stresses or that cellular antioxidant defenses assist in managing disturbances in metal homeostasis. Numerous studies have implicated the vacuole in metal ion storage and homeostasis (24MacDiarmid C.W. Gaither L.A. Eide D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2845-2855Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 25Nishimura K. Igarashi K. Kakinuma Y. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 1962-1964Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Pearce D.A.

A. 1997; 94: 5662-5666Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), and mutants defective in vacuole function or acidification are sensitive to various metal ions, including copper, nickel, and zinc (28Ramsay L.M. Gadd G.M. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1997; 152: 293-298Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Szczypka M.S. Zhu Z. Silar P. Thiele D.J. Yeast. 1997; 13: 1423-1435Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Because sod1Δ mutants display aberrant vacuolar morphology (22Corson L.B. Folmer J. Strain J.J. Culotta V.C. Cleveland D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27590-27596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), the possibility remained that the zinc sensitivity was caused by vacuole malfunction in thesod1Δ yeast. We reasoned that if the zinc sensitivity in our strain was due to defective vacuolar function, the ability of the cells to handle elevated levels of transition metal ions other than zinc would be affected as well. The experimental results depicted in Fig. 5 clearly demonstrate that sod1Δ cells are as resistant as wild-type cells to increased levels of Cu2+ or Ni2+. That is, their ability to detoxify metal ions other than zinc remains intact, and the defect responsible for the zinc sensitivity in sod1Δ strains is not one of general vacuolar function. Taken together, these data strongly suggest that the copper-free SOD present in lys7Δ cells as well as the normally metallated CuZn-SOD present in WT cells participate in zinc ion homeostasis. A relationship between zinc metabolism and iron metabolism is also possible. The zinc sensitivity of sod1Δ mutants may be an indirect consequence of their aberrant iron metabolism. Yeastsod1Δ mutants exhibit increased levels of “free” iron, which may also come from the destruction of vulnerable [Fe-S] clusters (7Srinivasan C. Liba A. Imlay J.A. Valentine J.S. Gralla E.B. J.

Because iron(II) and Zn(II) are similar chemically with respect to their coordination chemistry, they are transported by some of the same cellular transporters and can be bound by some of the same cellular proteins. Increased iron uptake may result in increased zinc uptake as well (30Askwith C.C. de Silva D. Kaplan J. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 27-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 31Eide D.J. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1998; 18: 441-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Thus, attempts by the sod1Δ yeast to increase iron may backfire in two ways: increased formation of hydroxyl radical due to increased Fenton chemistry (32Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M.C. Free Radicals in Biology and Medicine. Third Ed. Oxford University Press, New York1999Google Scholar) and the accumulation of toxic intracellular levels of zinc. Here we report thatlys7Δ yeast, unlike sod1Δ yeast, do not exhibit altered iron metabolism as evidenced by their wild-type-like level of EPR-detectable “free” iron (Fig. 2), and they do not accumulate increased levels of zinc inside the cells. Further work will be required to determine whether increased levels of “free” iron and of zinc are a result of the same process or of different ones, but the relationship is intriguing. In summary, our work has revealed unexpected differences betweenlys7Δ and sod1Δ mutant yeast that imply connections between superoxide toxicity, zinc metabolism, and iron metabolism. Our results indicate that the SOD1 polypeptide participates somehow in zinc homeostasis and that superoxide stress clearly involves iron metabolism. Continued investigations will shed more light on these relationships. We thank Drs. Barney L. Bales and Miroslav Peric at California State University, Northridge for the use of an EPR instrument and many helpful interactions."
https://openalex.org/W2085028600,"Rapid mRNA degradation directed by A + U-rich elements (AREs) is mediated by the interaction of specific RNA-binding proteins to these sequences. The protein chaperone Hsp70 has been identified in a cellular complex containing the ARE-binding protein AUF1 and has also been detected in direct contact with A + U-rich RNA substrates, indicating that Hsp70 may be involved in the regulation of ARE-directed mRNA turnover. By using gel mobility shift and fluorescence anisotropy assays, we have determined that Hsp70 directly and specifically associates with U-rich RNA substrates in solution. With the ARE from tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) mRNA, Hsp70 forms a dynamic complex consistent with a 1:1 association of protein:RNA but demonstrates cooperative binding behavior on polyuridylate substrates. Unlike AUF1, the RNA binding activity of Hsp70 is not regulated by ion-dependent folding of the TNFα ARE, suggesting that AUF1 and Hsp70 recognize distinct binding determinants on this RNA substrate. Binding of Hsp70 to the TNFα ARE is driven entirely by enthalpy at physiological temperatures, indicating that burial of hydrophobic surfaces is likely the principal mechanism stabilizing the Hsp70·RNA complex. Potential roles for the interaction of Hsp70 with ARE-containing mRNAs in the regulation of mRNA turnover and/or translational efficiency are discussed."

PIs serve multiple functions via the recruitment of cytosolic proteins with PI phosphate (PIP) binding domains (2Cremona O. De Camilli P. J.

Pentyala S.N. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 1291-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (831) Google Scholar). Recent work with the PI phosphatases indicates a central role for PIP2 and PIP3 in receptor-mediated endocytosis, although the precise nature of the PI kinases involved and their role have not been delineated (4Martin T.F. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 231-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar, 5Mukherjee S. Maxfield F.R. Traffic. 2000; 1: 203-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Signaling by ligand-activated receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) triggers the rapid internalization and degradation of receptor-ligand complexes (6Wells A. Welsh J.B. Lazar C.S. Wiley H.S. Gill G.N.

Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 6170-6175PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, the intracellular trafficking of receptors may allow for differential signaling according to subcellular locale (9Glading A.

Thus, receptor internalization impacts the biological responses to growth factor receptors and is a potential target for signal modulation. EGF receptor autophosphorylation is thought to result in a conformational change in the receptor revealing internalization motifs (10Sorkin A. Carpenter G. Science. 1993; 261: 612-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar) that allow the receptor to interact, directly or indirectly, with endocytic proteins, such as AP-2, clathrin, and dynamin (10Sorkin A.

Cell. 1999; 96: 677-687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Interestingly, recent work with colony-stimulating factor-1 receptor (CSF-1R) identified a possible connection between the endocytosis of activated RTKs and the type I phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase (PIPK) (12Davis J.N. Rock C.O. Cheng M. Watson J.B. Ashmun R.A. Kirk H. Kay R.J. Roussel M.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 7398-7406Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Indeed, PIP2, the product of PIPKs, has been shown to be involved in multiple steps of endocytosis, including the assembly of the clathrin coat, the regulation of adaptor proteins, and the production of endocytic vesicles via the regulation of dynamin (2Cremona O. De Camilli P. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1041-1052Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here, we demonstrate that overexpression of murine phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase type Iβ (PIPKβ) or a truncated construct, PIPKβ-truncated, but not the mouse type 1α isoform (PIPKα), causes dramatic alterations in the endocytic trafficking of the EGFR, including an effect on recruitment of dynamin and clathrin light chain. Our data indicate that PIPKβ plays a key role in mediating the recruitment of the protein machinery required for clathrin-mediated endocytosis. The mouse cDNAs of PIPKα and -β, the N-terminal truncated mutants (Δ1–197(α); Δ1–238(β)), and the PIPKβ kinase dead mutant (K179M) were subcloned into pCDNA3 or the Sindbis vector Toto1000:3′2J (13Li G.

Sindbis virions were generated by in vitro transcription with SP6 RNA polymerase (13Li G. Stahl P.D. J. Biol.

Sindbis virus, harvested from spent media 24–40 h after transfection, generally titered between 108 and 109 plaque-forming units per ml. Virus stocks were kept frozen at −80 °C before use. NR6 monolayers were either transiently transfected with pcDNA3 vector using Fugene 6 (Roche) as described (12Davis J.N. Rock C.O. Cheng M. Watson J.B. Ashmun R.A. Kirk H. Kay R.J. Roussel M.F. Mol.

Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 847-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar) were serum-starved and incubated with 100 mm EGF for the indicated times at 37 °C. Cell monolayers were washed with phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 5 mm β-glycerophosphate, and lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 50 mm Hepes, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 5 mm β-glycerophosphate, 5 mmEDTA, 1 mm NaF, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml pepstatin A, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, and 2 μg/ml aprotinin, pH 7.2). Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Protein concentration was determined using the Bio-Rad detergent-compatible protein assay. EGF receptor immunoprecipitation was carried out as described previously (15Barbieri M.A. Roberts R.L. Gumusboga A. Highfield H. Alvarez-Dominguez C. Wells A. Stahl P.D. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 539-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Mouse EGF (Life Technologies, Inc.) was iodinated with 125I (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using IODO-BEADS (Pierce), according to the manufacturer's protocol. The specific activities of labeled ligands were typically 150,000 cpm/ng (600 Ci/mmol). Quiescent NR6-EGFR cells expressing different PIPK constructs were washed in binding buffer, incubated at 4 °C for 3 h with 100 pm125I-EGF, and warmed up for different periods of time as indicated in each figure. Surface-bound and internalized ligands were discriminated essentially as described previously (15Barbieri M.A. Roberts R.L. Gumusboga A. Highfield H. Alvarez-Dominguez C. Wells A. Stahl P.D. J.

Briefly, unbound ligand was removed by washing the monolayer three times with ice-cold buffer (20 mm Hepes, 130 mmNaCl, 5 mm KCl, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mg/ml polyvinylpyrrolidone, pH 7.4). Surface-bound ligand was then collected in ice-cold acid strip buffer (50 mm glycine HCl, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mg/ml polyvinylpyrrolidone, pH 3.0) for 2 min, and internalized ligand was released in 1 n NaOH overnight at room temperature. Nonspecific binding (<2%) was assessed in the presence of 200 nm unlabeled human EGF (Sigma) and subtracted from the total. To quantitate receptor down-regulation, NR6-EGFR cells transfected as described above were incubated for various times with EGF (100 nm) at 37 °C and then rinsed with cold medium. Surface EGF was then removed by mild acid/salt treatment as described above. Remaining cell surface binding sites were then quantified by incubating the cells with 100 pm125I-EGF at 4 °C for 3 h (15Barbieri M.A. Roberts R.L. Gumusboga A. Highfield H. Alvarez-Dominguez C. Wells A. Stahl P.D. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 539-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). NR6-EGFR cells, grown on glass coverslips, were examined by confocal microscopy in the absence or presence of 100 nm EGF in (α-minimal essential medium containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin and 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.2) as described previously (15Barbieri M.A. Roberts R.L. Gumusboga A. Highfield H. Alvarez-Dominguez C. Wells A. Stahl P.D. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 539-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Confocal microscopy was carried out on a Bio-Rad MRC1024 confocal microscope using a 63 ×, 1.4 numerical aperture bright-field objective and fluorescein filter sets. Type 1 PIPKs consist of three isoforms, α, β, and γ (17Hinchliffe K.A. Ciruela A. Irvine R.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1436: 87-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar,18Fruman D.A. Meyers R.E. Cantley L.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 481-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (1323) Google Scholar). Earlier work has shown that expression of PIPK-truncated, an enzymatically inactive fragment, alters the endocytosis of the CSF-1R (12Davis J.N. Rock C.O. Cheng M. Watson J.B. Ashmun R.A. Kirk H. Kay R.J. Roussel M.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 7398-7406Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). To more fully delineate the role of PIPKβ in receptor-mediated endocytosis, we examined the effects of expressing PIPKβ and PIPKβ-truncated on the internalization of 125I-EGF. PIPK constructs (β and α), cloned into a Sindbis virus expression vector (13Li G. Stahl P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24475-24480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), were transiently expressed in NR6-EGFR cells (8Masui H. Wells A. Lazar C.S. Rosenfeld M.G. Gill G.N. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 6170-6175PubMed Google Scholar, 14Chen P. Xie H. Sekar M.C. Gupta K. Wells A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 847-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar), and EGFR endocytosis was examined by following the uptake of 125I-EGF as described in the legend to Fig. 1. In cells expressing PIPKβ, endocytosis of 125I-EGF was significantly enhanced, whereas in cells overexpressing PIPKβ-truncated, endocytosis of 125I-EGF was potently inhibited. Although intracellular accumulation of EGF in cells expressing either PIPKβ or PIPKβ-truncated approached a steady state at 15–20 min, cells expressing the wild type kinase accumulated about 5-fold more EGF than cells expressing the truncated construct. In addition, overexpression of a “kinase dead” mutant (PIPKβ-dead) also significantly inhibited 125I-EGF uptake (Fig. 1). Addition of EGF to cells results in the internalization and degradation of EGF (6Wells A. Welsh J.B. Lazar C.S. Wiley H.S. Gill G.N. Rosenfeld M.G. Science. 1990; 247: 962-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar, 7Vieira A.V. Lamaze C. Schmid S.L. Science. 1996; 274: 2086-2089Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar, 8Masui H. Wells A. Lazar C.S. Rosenfeld M.G. Gill G.N. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 6170-6175PubMed Google Scholar), and therefore we examined the effect of PIPKβ and the two inhibitory mutants on down-regulation of EGFR following exposure to ligand. NR6-EGFR cells were infected with Sindbis virus, as described above, encoding PIPKβ or the inhibitory constructs, and the rate of EGFR down-regulation was examined, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” In control cells, 64% of surface EGFR was lost following exposure to EGF within 3 h. In cells overexpressing PIPKβ, 82% of surface EGFR was lost, whereas the majority of surface EGFR remained at the cell surface in cells expressing either PIPKβ-truncated (24% lost) or PIPKβ-dead(11% lost). Failure to internalize should lead to higher levels of125I-EGF binding in cells expressing either PIPKβ-truncated or PIPKβ-dead. Indeed, the expression of the two mutants, but not the wild type kinase, substantially increased EGF cell surface binding in transfected cells (data not shown). We next set out to determine whether PIPKβ-truncatedblocked EGFR-mediated endocytosis by preventing the recruitment of the cytosolic wild type kinase to the membrane (1Anderson R.A. Boronenkov I.V. Doughman S.D. Kunz J. Loijens J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9907-9910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). A cell fractionation study (15Barbieri M.A. Roberts R.L. Gumusboga A. Highfield H. Alvarez-Dominguez C. Wells A. Stahl P.D. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 539-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), using NR6-EGFR cells expressing the PIPKβ or PIPKβ-truncated, revealed that PIPKβ is localized to both membranes and cytosol, whereas PIPKβ-truncated is localized almost exclusively to the cytosolic fraction. Addition of EGF prior to fractionation resulted in a shift in the distribution of the cytosolic wild type kinase to the membrane, whereas PIPKβ-truncated cytosolic distribution was unaffected by EGF (data not shown). The fact that PIPKβ-truncated is mostly cytosolic and enzymatically inactive (12Davis J.N. Rock C.O. Cheng M. Watson J.B. Ashmun R.A. Kirk H. Kay R.J. Roussel M.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 7398-7406Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) raises the possibility that PIPKβ-truncated may interact with the wild type enzyme such that targeting to the plasma membrane is prevented. To delineate the role of PIPKβ-truncated in inhibiting endocytosis, we examined the effect of expressing PIPKβ-truncated on the targeting of PIPKβ to the plasma membrane in living cells. A transfection/infection protocol, as described in the legend to Fig. 2A, was used to first express PIPKβ and then either GST-PIPKβ-truncated or GFP-PIPKα-truncated. Data in Fig. 2 A, panel II, show that GST-PIPKβ-truncated is localized totally to the cytoplasmic compartment. In cells expressing GST-PIPKβ-truncated, PIPKβ is also seen predominantly in the cytoplasm (panel I), suggesting that the truncated construct is blocking the targeting of PIPKβ to the plasma membrane. In control cells (panels I and IV,arrows), PIPKβ is localized to the plasma membrane. A merged image (panel III) shows the co-localization of PIPKβ and GST-PIPKβ-truncated in the cytoplasmic compartment. As an additional control, we used an N-terminal truncation of PIPKα, which is truncated from the same point in the conserved core kinase homology domain (17Hinchliffe K.A. Ciruela A. Irvine R.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1436: 87-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 18Fruman D.A. Meyers R.E. Cantley L.C. Annu. Rev.

Surprisingly, GFP-PIPKα-truncated localized to the nucleus as shown inpanel V, and the merged image (panel VI) shows the distinct localization of PIPKβ and GFP-PIPKα-truncated, indicating that the truncated PIPKα isoform does not block PIPKβ plasma membrane targeting. To determine whether PIPKβ and PIPKβ-truncated are physically associated, co-immunoprecipitation experiments were carried out using NR6-EGFR cells expressing both GFP-PIPK (α or β) and GST-PIPKβ-truncated. A second set of control experiments were carried out with cells co-expressing HA-PIPKβ and GFP-PIPKα-truncated. Fig. 2 B, panels I and II, show Western blots of total lysates indicating the approximate levels of cellular expression of the GFP, GST, and HA constructs. Cell lysates were prepared and immunoprecipitated with anti-GFP antibodies (Fig. 2 B,panels III and IV) and following SDS-PAGE, Western blotting with anti-GST antibodies (panel III,upper) indicated that immunoprecipitation of GFP-PIPKβ results in the co-immunoprecipitation of GST-PIPKβ-truncated. On the contrary, GFP-PIPKα failed to co-immunoprecipitate GST-PIPKβ-truncated. As a control (panel IV), immunoprecipitation of GFP-PIPKα-truncated failed to co-immunoprecipitate HA-PIPKβ. We speculate that the formation of a complex between the wild type enzyme and truncated construct may interfere with the correct targeting of the kinase to the plasma membrane. This speculation is further supported by gel exclusion chromatography analysis, which suggests that the PIPKβ exists as large multimeric complexes. 3N. Davis, personal communication. Previous studies indicate that one or more phosphoinositide kinase activities partially co-purify with EGFR (16Cochet C. Filhol O. Payrastre B. Hunter T. Gill G.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 637-644Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and that EGF stimulates phosphoinositide kinase activity in several cell types (23Walker D.H. Pike L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 7513-7517Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). To determine whether PIPKβ and PIPKβ-truncated are physically associated with EGFR, cells expressing PIPKβ, PIPKβ-truncated, or both constructs were stimulated with EGF, and immunoprecipitation studies were carried out as described in the legend to Fig. 2 C. Fig. 2 C, panel I, shows EGFR detected with both anti-EGFR and anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies, and Fig. 2 C, panel II, shows a co-immunoprecipitation of PIPKβ with EGFR detected with a PIPKβ-specific antibody. The data also indicate that ligand activation of the receptor results in a significant increase in EGFR-PIPKβ association. On the contrary, EGFR and PIPKβ-truncated failed to co-immunoprecipitate. Moreover, co-expression of PIPKβ-truncated with the wild type kinase blocked the co-immunoprecipitation of an EGFR·PIPKβ complex. PIPK enzymatic activity, which is regulated by phosphorylation (24Park S.J. Itoh T. Takenawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4781-4787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), was quantitated in the immunoprecipitates and, as indicated in the legend of Fig. 2 C, corresponds with the quantitation of the Western blots (i.e. the lipid kinase which is recruited to EGFR is active). Another factor that may influence the recruitment of PIPKβ is the lipid binding site described by Anderson and colleagues (1Anderson R.A. Boronenkov I.V. Doughman S.D. Kunz J. Loijens J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9907-9910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar), who have suggested that lipid kinase recruitment may include both a lipid binding site and specific protein targeting sites. Our data suggest that the expression of the PIPKβ-truncatedinhibits endocytosis of 125I-EGF by blocking the targeting of the PIPKβ to EGFR at the plasma membrane. Interestingly, Toliaset al. (19Tolias K.F. Hartwig J.H. Ishihara H. Shibasaki Y. Cantley L.C. Carpenter C.L. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 153-156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) have shown that the thrombin activation of PIPKα and β is regulated by Rac, although only PIPKα is involved in Rac-dependent actin assembly. These new data now delineate different functions associated with different isoforms of type 1 PIPKs. Our data indicate a key role for PIPKβ in the early steps of internalization. PIP2, the product of PIPKβ, has been shown to bind specific domains (25Salim K. Bottomley M.J. Querfurth E. Zvelebil J.J. Gout I. Scaife R. Margolis R.L. Gigg R. Smith C.I. Driscoll P.C. Waterfield M.D. Panayotou G. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6241-6250Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar), found in many of the proteins required for endocytosis and signaling. Dynamin and AP2, for example, bind to PIP2 and regulate EGF receptor-mediated endocytosis (26Jost M. Simpson F. Kavran J.M. Lemmon M.A. Schmid S.L. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1399-1402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate whether the expression of PIPKβ, PIPKβ-dead, or PIPKβ-truncated affects the localization of proteins controlling clathrin-coated vesicle formation, cells were transfected with Sindbis virus encoding PIPKβ or the two inhibitory mutants, and the localization of clathrin light chain (CLC) or dynamin, following EGF stimulation, was analyzed by confocal microscopy. In Fig. 3 A, we show that the expression of PIPKβ-truncated or PIPKβ-dead blocks the targeting of dynamin to the plasma membrane. GFP-PIPKβ (panel I) is found on the plasma membrane as is dynamin (panel II), where they co-localized (panel III). In addition, dynamin is also localized to intracellular structures. GFP-PIPKβ-truncated localization is cytoplasmic (panel IV),and cells expressing PIPKβ-truncated are unable to recruit dynamin to the plasma membrane (panel V); however, some dynamin in the Golgi region remained (panel V, arrowhead). GFP-PIPKβ-dead localizes to the plasma membrane (panel VII), but dynamin recruitment is still blocked (panel VIII), indicating the requirement of an active type 1 kinase for dynamin recruitment in response to EGF. Recruitment of clathrin light chain is also an index of activated endocytosis, and we examined the effect PIPKβ, PIPKβ-truncated, or PIPKβ-dead on the localization of CLC. Cells stably expressing GFP-clathrin light chain (GFP-CLC) were infected with Sindbis encoding the PIPKβ constructs, stimulated with EGF, and examined by confocal microscopy as described above. In Fig. 3 B, panel I, GFP-CLC is localized to punctate spots throughout the cytoplasm. Panel II shows the plasma membrane localization of PIPKβ, and the partial localization of the two proteins in the merged image is seen inpanel III. In cells expressing PIPKβ-truncated(panel IV), punctate localization of GFP-CLC is substantially lost, compared with the neighboring untransfected cell (panel IV, arrows), and PIPKβ-truncated is seen localized in the cytoplasm (panel V). Panel VI shows the substantially reduced co-localization of GFP-CLC and PIPKβ-truncated. Last, we examined PIPKβ-dead in cells expressing GFP-CLC. As with the truncated construct, the recruitment of CLC in response to EGF was lost (panel VII). PIPKβ-dead is localized to the plasma membrane (panel VIII), but the absence of co-localization is shown in the merged image (panel IX). These experiments show that recruitment of an active PIPKβ to the plasma membrane in response to EGF is required for the subsequent recruitment of dynamin and clathrin light chain. These observations explain the effect of the truncated kinase on receptor-mediated endocytosis. Our data indicate that PIPKβ plays a central role in receptor-mediated endocytosis via its recruitment to the EGFR and via the production of its product, PIP2, which in turn affects the binding of specific factors, required for endocytosis.

Thus, it may well be that the various type 1 PIPK isoforms have both independent and possibly sequential functions in signaling leading to endocytosis and ruffling. Expression of PIPKβ-truncated blocks the recruitment of PIPKβ, but additionally, expression of the truncated kinase or the kinase dead mutant appears to block coated vesicle formation by sequestering or preventing recruitment and/or assembly of additional limiting components essential for coated vesicle budding. It is interesting to note that endocytic proteins such as epsin and AP180, which contain ENTH domains that bind PIP2, have also been implicated in the endocytosis of the EGFR (27Itoh T. Koshiba S. Kigawa T. Kikuchi A. Yokoyama S. Takenawa T. Science. 2001; 291: 1047-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar, 28Ford M.G. Pearse B.M. Higgins M.K. Vallis Y. Owen D.J. Gibson A. Hopkins C.R. Evans P.R. McMahon H.T. Science. 2001; 291: 1051-1055Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar). An additional factor in the regulation of PIPK activity is phospholipase D (PLD). PLD has a required PH domain and is reported to be recruited via the action of PIPKα (29Divecha N. Roefs M. Halstead J.R. D'Andrea S. Fernandez-Borga M. Oomen L. Saqib K.M. Wakelam M.J. D'Santos C. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5440-5449Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The product of PLD, phosphatidic acid, is known to be an activator of PIPK activity (30Jenkins G.H. Fisette P.L. Anderson R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11547-11554Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), creating a possible positive feedback scenario for the amplified activation of PIPKβ. Studies in which synaptojanin, a PI(4,5)P2 5-phosphatase, has been deleted confirmed a central role for PIP2 in endocytosis (31McPherson P.S. Garcia E.P. Slepnev V.I. David C. Zhang X. Grabs D. Sossin W.S. Bauerfeind R. Nemoto Y. Nature. 1996; 379: 353-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). Our studies now directly demonstrate a central and fundamental role for PIPKβ in receptor-mediated endocytosis. However, many additional factors need to be identified, including those factors that are responsible for the recruitment, activation, and deactivation of the kinase. We thank Phyllis Hanson, John Heuser, Maurine Linder, and Linda Pike for many helpful discussions; Phyllis Hanson and Joshua Lauer for the CHO GFP-CLC cell line; and Marina Kisseleva for quantifying PIPK activity."

The recent discovery of DNA polymerase Y family (DinB/UmuC/RAD30/REV1 superfamily) raises a question of whether the DNA polymerase activities are modified by accessory proteins such as proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). In fact, the activity of DNA pol IV (DinB) of Escherichia coli is enhanced upon interaction with the β subunit, the processivity factor of DNA pol III. Here, we report the activity ofSso DNA pol Y1 encoded by the dbh gene of the archaeon Sulfolobus solfataricus is greatly enhanced by the presence of PCNA and replication factor C (RFC). Sso pol Y1per se was a distributive enzyme but a substantial increase in the processivity was observed on poly(dA)-oligo(dT) in the presence of PCNA (039p or 048p) and RFC. The length of the synthesized DNA product reached at least 200 nucleotides. Sso pol Y1 displayed a higher affinity for DNA compared with pol IV of E. coli, suggesting that the two DNA polymerases have distinct reason(s) to require the processivity factors for efficient DNA synthesis.

Thus, the new DNA polymerases seem to function by assisting the conventional DNA replicases to cope with faulty DNA templates by taking over the DNA synthesis at aberrant sites (for recent reviews, see Refs. 1Goodman M.F.

Common features of family Y DNA polymerases include the lack of 3′-exonuclease proofreading activity and synthesis of DNA with low fidelity in a distributive fashion. The human DNA pol ι has been shown recently to possess 5′-deoxyribose phosphate lyase activity, suggesting a role in base excision repair (13Bebenek K. Tissier A. Frank E.G. McDonald J.P. Prasad R. Wilson S.H. Woodgate R. Kunkel T.A. Science. 2001; 291: 2156-2159Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). It has been hypothesized that the very low processivity of these polymerases prevents excessive introduction of mutations because of extended error-prone DNA synthesis. This has been, however, questioned recently when DNA polymerase IV of Escherichia coli (pol IV) (7Wagner J. Gruz P. Kim S.R. Yamada M. Matsui K. Fuchs R.P. Nohmi T. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 281-286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar) was found to synthesize tracks of more than 300 nucleotides upon interaction with the β subunit of pol III (14Wagner J. Fujii S. Gruz P. Nohmi T. Fuchs R.P. EMBO Rep. 2000; 1: 484-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The β subunit and its eukaryotic counterpart, i.e. PCNA, play essential roles in processive chromosomal replication by forming a sliding platform that mediates the interaction of DNA polymerases with DNA (15Waga S. Stillman B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 721-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar). In addition, the sliding clamps also interact with a variety of proteins other than DNA polymerases involved in DNA processing and even in cell cycle control (16Warbrick E. BioEssays. 2000; 22: 997-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). It is therefore of general interest to elucidate the relationships between various members of Y family DNA polymerases and the corresponding sliding clamps. Archaea, the third domain of life, is thought to possess a DNA replication apparatus similar to that of Eukarya, although its morphology is more prokaryotic-like (17Olsen G.J. Woese C.R. Cell. 1997; 89: 991-994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). As evidenced by the genome sequencing project, many eukaryotic replication proteins have close homologues in Archaea (18Edgell D.R. Doolittle W.F. Cell. 1997; 89: 995-998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 19Leipe D.D. Aravind L. Koonin E.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 3389-3401Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the thermoacidophilic archaebacterium Sulfolobus solfataricus possesses two PCNA-like sliding clamps termed Sso 039p (244 amino acids, 27 kDa) and Sso 048p (249 amino acids, 27 kDa) (20De Felice M. Sensen C.W. Charlebois R.L. Rossi M. Pisani F.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 291: 47-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Both proteins possess a trimeric structure, which is similar to eukaryotic PCNAs, and functions as a processivity factor that stimulates the activity of monomeric family B DNA polymerases from this organism (Sso DNA polymerase B1) (21Pisani F.M. De Felice M. Manco G. Rossi M. Extremophiles. 1998; 2: 171-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 22Pisani F.M. De Felice M. Rossi M.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 2711-2716Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) by enhancing processivity. In addition, a clamp-loader apparatus was recently isolated fromS. solfataricus (25Pisani F.M. De Felice M. Carpentieri F. Rossi M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 301: 61-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). It is a complex of a homotetramer of a small subunit (37 kDa) and a large subunit (46 kDa), and thus is namedSso RFC complex. It has been shown that the amount of PCNA (either 039p or 048p) required for Sso DNA pol B1 stimulation markedly decreased in the presence of RFC complex and ATP. Here, we report the biochemical characteristics of the DinB homologue (Dbh) of S. solfataricus (26Kulaeva O.I. Koonin E.V. McDonald J.P. Randall S.K. Rabinovich N. Connaughton J.F. Levine A.S. Woodgate R. Mutat. Res. 1996; 357: 245-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), which we term SsoDNA pol Y1. Although this polymerase per se is a distributive enzyme, its activity is enhanced markedly in the presence of PCNA (either 039p or 048p) and RFC complex. Because the DNA replication apparatus of Archaea is closer to that of Eukarya than Bacteria, this finding has implications for other Y-type DNA polymerases from higher organisms including humans. Thedbh gene was amplified by polymerase chain reaction technique using the S. solfataricus genomic DNA as a template and cloned into the vector pET-21a (Novagen, Madison, WI) creating the expression plasmid pETdbh.21. Sso pol Y1 was expressed from this plasmid in E. coli strain BL21-CodonPlus™ (DE3)-RIL (Novagen) after induction with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. The induced cells were lysed by sonication, and the soluble fraction was subjected to heat precipitation at 70 °C for 30 min. After centrifugation, the protein was precipitated from the supernatant by ammonium sulfate added to 50% saturation and, after redissolving, applied to Phenyl-Sepharose HP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column. Subsequent purification steps were identical to the purification method of native DinB protein described previously (14Wagner J. Fujii S. Gruz P. Nohmi T. Fuchs R.P. EMBO Rep. 2000; 1: 484-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), except that the final sample was dialyzed against a buffer containing 150 mm NaCl. The purity of the sample was confirmed by SDS-PAGE, followed by Coomassie G250 staining. Standard polymerase reactions (10 μl) were performed in 30 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), 7.5 mm MgCl2, 1.25 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 5% glycerol, 100 μmdNTPs, 50 nm Sso pol Y1 protein, and 50 nm annealed 5′-32P-primer/template substrate at 55 °C for 10 min unless otherwise indicated. When DNA pol IV ofE. coli, Klenow exo+, or Klenow exo− was used instead of pol Y1, the concentration of the enzyme was 10 nm and the reaction was performed at 37 °C for 10 min. In some lesion bypass experiments, the concentration of pol IV was 20 or 100 nm as indicated in Fig. 4 D. Reactions were terminated by adding one volume of stop solution (95% formamide, 20 mm EDTA, 0.025% xylene cyanol, and 0.025% bromphenol blue), and the products were resolved by electrophoresis in 12% denaturing polyacrylamide gel and visualized by phosphorimaging using the Molecular Imager System GS-525 (Bio-Rad). Klenow exo+ and Klenow exo− were purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). DNA pol IV of E. coli was purified as described previously (14Wagner J. Fujii S. Gruz P. Nohmi T. Fuchs R.P. EMBO Rep. 2000; 1: 484-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The template used for all reactions was 5′-GAAGGGATCCTTAAGACNYTAACCGGTCTTCGCGCG-3′, where N represents either A, T, G, or C and Yrepresents G for dNMP incorporation assays (Figs. 1 B, 2, and3). For lesion bypass assays, N represents T, andY represents either G (no lesion) or one of the four DNA lesions, i.e. abasic site (AP site): tetrahydrofuran, 8-oxoguanine, O 6-methylguanine, and uracil (Fig. 4). The primers used were 5′-CGCGCGAAGACCGG-3′ for standard dNMP incorporation assays (Fig. 1 B) and “running start” bypass assays (Fig. 4, A and B), 5′-CGCGCGAAGACCGGTTA-3′ for “standing start” bypass assays (Fig. 4,C and D), and 5′-CGCGCGAAGACCGGTTAC-3′ for single dNMP incorporation assays (Fig. 2 A). The primer 5′-CGCGCGAAGACCGGTTACX-3′ was used for 3′-exonuclease assays (Fig. 2 B), where X represents G, and for terminal mismatch extension assays (Fig. 3), where X represents any of the four bases. The 36-mer templates containing the DNA lesions were synthesized by Nippon Gene Ltd. (Toyama, Japan). All other oligonucleotides were synthesized by BEX Corp. (Tokyo) and double-purified by high performance liquid chromatography.Figure 1Purification and DNA polymerase activity of the Dbh protein (Sso pol Y1).

The reaction was carried out for 30 min at room temperature and stopped by adding the standard Laemmli SDS-PAGE loading buffer followed by immediate denaturation at 100 °C for 5 min. Protein fragments were resolved by 15% SDS-PAGE and visualized by Coomassie G-250 staining. The N-terminal amino acid sequences of selected proteolytic fragments were determined at Takara Shuzo Co.

The Sso RFC complex, SsoPCNA 039, and Sso PCNA 048 proteins were purified as described previously (20De Felice M. Sensen C.W. Charlebois R.L. Rossi M. Pisani F.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 291: 47-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 25Pisani F.M. De Felice M. Carpentieri F. Rossi M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 301: 61-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Reactions were carried out for 10 min at 60 °C and terminated by adding stop solution as in the primer extension assay. Elongation products were separated by electrophoresis in 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gel and visualized by autoradiography. The DNA binding assay was performed using the BIAcoreX instrument (Biacore K.K., Japan). About 150 fmol of 34-mer oligonucleotide biotinylated at its 3′ end was captured on the SA chip surface and optionally annealed with complementary oligonucleotides to form either primed DNA or dsDNA. Analysis was performed by injecting the appropriate proteins at specified concentration within the range of 0.05–1 μm in the standard buffer HBS-EP (0.01 m HEPES (pH 7.4), 0.15m NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, and 0.005% polysorbate 20) over the chip surface. The equilibrium dissociation constants (K D) were calculated from the kinetic traces using the BIAevaluation software version 3.0 (Biacore AB) according to the predefined model “1:1 binding with mass transfer.” In the case of pol Y1, we assayed the interactions at two different temperatures (25 and 40 °C), but found no differences. All other proteins were tested at the standard temperature of 25 °C. Ssb was purchased from U. S. Biochemical Corp. Thedbh gene of S. solfataricus was described previously as an archaeal DinB homologue based on its sequence similarity to the DinB-like proteins (26Kulaeva O.I. Koonin E.V. McDonald J.P. Randall S.K. Rabinovich N. Connaughton J.F. Levine A.S. Woodgate R. Mutat. Res. 1996; 357: 245-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). We cloned the gene and overexpressed its product in E. coli. The protein was purified to homogeneity using four chromatographic steps as shown in Fig. 1 A, and its DNA polymerase activity was demonstrated by the primer extension assay. Fig. 1 B shows that DNA synthesis was dependent on the presence of template DNA and that the synthesis was very distributive (lanes 2 and 3). It possessed no RNA polymerase activity (lane 4). The activity was completely inhibited by the addition of EDTA (lane 5), but was resistant to inhibitors, i.e. ddTTP (lane 6) and aphidicolin (lane 7). The polymerase was most active over the range 55–70 °C with a longer template primer (52/34-mer) (data not shown). Hence, the dbh gene shares similarity with other homologues of DinB/UmuC/Rev1/Rad30 proteins at functional level. Recently, the superfamily of DinB/UmuC/Rev1/Rad30 proteins was classified as family Y of DNA polymerases next to the family X of DNA polymerases/deoxynucleotidyltransferases (2Ohmori H. Friedberg E.C. Fuchs R.P.P. Goodman M.F. Hanaoka F. Hinkle D.C. Kunkel T.A. Lawrence C.W. Livneh Z. Nohmi T. Prakash L. Prakash S. Todo T. Walker G.C. Wang Z. Woodgate R. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 7-8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar). Based on this classification, we termed the product of dbh geneSso DNA polymerase Y1 (Sso pol Y1) based on the previously introduced nomenclature system used for DNA polymerases fromSulfolobus (27Edgell D.R. Klenk H.P. Doolittle W.F. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 2632-2640Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To examine whether Sso pol Y1 is a bona fide DNA polymerase obeying Watson-Crick base pairing rules, we conducted the single dNMP incorporation assay (Fig. 2 A). Indeed, the prevalently incorporated bases by pol Y1 correctly matched the template sequence. Only the incorporation of dGMP opposite template C may seem unclear, but this is specific to this particular primer-template sequence where GC compression occurs and therefore the migration of primers extended by 1 or 2 G nucleotides do not shift as normally expected (compare the same sequence on Fig. 3 A,lane C/G template-primer). Some level of misincorporation particularly at the +2 position seen in Fig. 2 A could be because of the lack of 3′-exonuclease proofreading activity, which is demonstrated in Fig. 2 B. Certain Y-family DNA polymerases are tolerant to terminally misaligned primers in certain sequence contexts and are implicated in DNA lesion bypass (11Livneh Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25639-25642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 28Vaisman A. Tissier A. Frank E.G. Goodman M.F. Woodgate R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30615-30622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). We tested the abilities of pol Y1 to extend from all possible 12 primer-template terminal mismatches and bypass DNA lesions. As shown in Fig. 3 A, the G/G (template-primer) mismatch was extended to significant degree. It should be noted that other primers containing mismatched G at the termini, i.e. G/A and G/T, were not extended. In comparison, Watson-Crick base pairs such as T/A, G/C, C/G, and A/T were extended efficiently. To determine the base incorporated next to the mismatched G/G DNA, we conducted the single nucleotide incorporation assay (Fig. 3 B). Of the four dNMPs, only dTMP was efficiently incorporated (lane T) and the full extension product was shorter than those generated by Klenow exo+ and exo− enzymes (lanes N, 1, and 2). Thus, it is most likely that pol Y1 extends this type of mismatch in a slippage mode; the extension occurs from the correctly paired C/G (template-primer) terminus with looping out of one guanine base in the template strand. Because the optimal growth temperature of S. solfataricus is 87 °C (25Pisani F.M. De Felice M. Carpentieri F. Rossi M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 301: 61-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), and heat induces depurination and cytosine deamination in the DNA, we examined the abilities of Sso pol Y1 to bypass AP site and uracil in template DNA (Fig. 4, A and C). In addition, we tested its abilities to bypass other naturally occurring DNA lesions, i.e. 8-oxoguanine andO 6-methylguanine, which may be involved in spontaneous mutagenesis (29Lindahl T. Nature. 1993; 362: 709-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (4378) Google Scholar). For comparison, we also conducted the assay using pol IV of E. coli, a prototype of Y family DNA polymerase (Fig. 4, B and D). When AP site was located in the template DNA, pol Y1 as well as pol IV stopped one base before the lesion and no substantial bypass was observed (Fig. 4,A and B, lane 3). Bypass synthesis of uracil by pol Y1 appeared to be less efficient than that by pol IV (Fig. 4, A and B, lane 6). In contrast, bypass of 8-oxoguanine by pol Y1 seemed to be more efficient than that of 8-oxoguanine by pol IV (Fig. 4, A andB, lane 4). The primer extension by two polymerases was inhibited to a similar extent by the presence ofO 6-methylguanine (Fig. 4, A andB, lane 5). To examine the effects of sequence context, template bases 5′ next to the lesions were changed from T to A, G, or C. However, such changes did not affect the efficiencies of trans-lesion bypass synthesis by pol Y1 as well as pol IV (data not shown). Bypass efficiencies in vitro are sometimes modulated by the amounts of enzyme used and/or the incubation temperature (30Ohashi E. Ogi T. Kusumoto R. Iwai S. Masutani C. Hanaoka F. Ohmori H. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1589-1594PubMed Google Scholar, 31Zhang Y. Yuan F. Wu X. Wang M. Rechkoblit O. Taylor J.S. Geacintov N.E. Wang Z. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 4138-4146Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Zhou B. Pata J.D. Steitz T.A. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 427-437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Thus, we varied the reaction conditions for the bypass syntheses across AP site or uracil. When the protein concentrations were increased 10 times, pol Y1 inserted dNMP opposite AP site and pol IV bypassed the lesion (Fig. 4, C and D,AP site). Bypass of AP site by pol Y1 was achieved when pol Y1 concentration was increased 20 times and the incubation was carried out at 37 °C (Fig. 4 C,AP site*). Bypass synthesis of uracil by pol Y1 was still less efficient than that of pol IV even when the protein concentrations were increased twice or 10 times (Fig. 4, Cand D, Uracil). The results of these side-by-side comparison suggest that Sso pol Y1 is not more competent than pol IV of E. coli to bypass AP site and uracil in template DNA. Because of the similarities both at the primary amino acid sequence level and at functional level, we next examined whether the domain organizations of pol Y1 are similar to those of pol IV ofE. coli. For this purpose, we chose the limited proteolysis and compared the cleavage sites of pol Y1 and pol IV (Fig. 5 A). The nonspecific serine protease subtilisin cleaved both Sso pol Y1 and pol IV and produced major cleavage products of ∼30 kDa. In addition, minor products of 36 and 9 kDa were observed with pol Y1 and pol IV, respectively. Bovine serum albumin was used as a control. Bovine serum albumin was relatively resistant to limited proteolysis, and subtilisin did not produce any distinct band pattern, which is consistent with its globular and single-domain characteristics. To map the cleavage sites, we determined the N-terminal amino acid sequences of the cleaved products. The results showed that the major cleavage occurred for both pol Y1 and pol IV at the same site; just before the highly conserved SI(L)DE motif (Fig. 5 B). The determined sequence of the minor 36-kDa cleavage product of pol Y1 was A-N-Y-E-A-R-K-L-G-V-K-A-G, suggesting that the other cleavage occurred within the motif II of the protein (Fig. 5 B). Because the partial amino acid sequence of 9-kDa fragment of pol IV was M-R-K-I-I-H-V-D-M-D-(C)-F, it was probably the N-terminal 9-kDa fragment cleaved by subtilisin. These results suggest that pol Y1 and pol IV possess similar but slightly different structural organizations and the major cleaved sites,i.e. SI(L)DE motif, are exposed to the solvent. Based on the functional and structural similarities between pol Y1 and pol IV, we next examined whether PCNA of S. solfataricus could stimulate the activity of pol Y1. As described in the Introduction, this organism possesses two forms of PCNA, i.e. Sso PCNA 039 and Sso PCNA 048 (20De Felice M. Sensen C.W. Charlebois R.L. Rossi M. Pisani F.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 291: 47-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). We carried out polymerase activity assays using an oligo(dT)-primed poly(dA) template (Fig. 6). Strikingly, both Sso PCNA clamps stimulated the synthetic activity of pol Y1. Stimulation was clearly expressed in the presence ofSso RFC complex, which is reported to be able to load bothSulfolobus sliding clamps onto the DNA in an ATP-dependent reaction (25Pisani F.M. De Felice M. Carpentieri F. Rossi M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 301: 61-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Given the length of the used poly(dA) template, we estimated that the length of the synthesized DNA product at the highest pol Y1 concentration used was at least 200 nucleotides. Thus, the new pol Y1 can also synthesize longer DNA tracks upon interaction with the processivity subunits similar to the mainS. solfataricus DNA polymerase B1 and to its prokaryotic counterpart E. coli pol IV. For a better understanding of the interaction between Sso pol Y1 and DNA, we examined its interaction with DNAs (dsDNA, ssDNA, and primed DNA) using the surface plasmon resonance technique and compared the mode of DNA binding to those of reference enzymes (Fig. 7). The reference proteins included pol IV of E. coli, rat pol β, and Klenow exo+ as representatives of family X and family A DNA polymerases, respectively, and E. coli Ssb as a DNA-binding protein. Although pol Y1 substantially bound to DNA, it showed no clear preference of any type of DNA. In contrast, pol IV appeared to favor ssDNA but its binding was much weaker than pol Y1. pol β preferred fully dsDNA to primed and ssDNA, whereas pol I strongly favored primed DNA over dsDNA and exhibited no binding to ssDNA at all. As expected, the Ssb protein bound only to ssDNA or partially ssDNA, i.e. primed DNA. To provide quantitative evaluation of such interactions, we calculated the equilibrium dissociation constants (K D) from the kinetic traces. As shown in Table I, it is apparent that pol Y1 bound to DNA with similar affinities as pol I and pol β (K D range: 10–50 nm), whereas the interaction of pol IV with DNA was generally very weak (K D ran"

In the absence of LIF, ES cells are irreversibly committed to differentiate into various lineages. In this study we have set up an in vitro assay based on the anti-apoptotic activity of LIF to distinguish pluripotent from “differentiation-committed” ES cells. We have examined the phosphorylation profiles of known (STAT3 and ERKs) and identified new (ribosomal S6 kinases (RSKs) and cAMP-responsive element-binding protein (CREB)) LIF-regulated targets in ES and in ES-derived neuronal cells. We have demonstrated that although STAT3, a crucial player in the maintenance of ES cell pluripotency, is induced by LIF in all cell types tested, the LIF-dependent activation of RSKs is restricted to ES cells. We have shown that LIF-induced phosphorylation of RSKs in ES cells is dependent on ERKs, whereas STAT3 phosphorylation is not mediated by any known MAPK activities.

It is secreted by various cell types and mediates opposite effects (either proliferative or differentiative) depending on the cell lineages and stage of differentiation (1Hilton D.J. Trends Biochem.

LIF also influences the survival, differentiation, and response to injury of neuronal cell lineages and synergizes with ciliary neurotrophic factor for motoneuron cell survival (4Aloisi F. Rosa S.

The pleiotropic effects of LIF signaling are transduced by the heterodimeric gp130/gp190 (LIFRβ) receptor, which becomes phosphorylated on tyrosine residues by the constitutively associated LIF-activated JAK tyrosine kinases. Different parts of the gp130 subunits serve as docking sites for cell-type-specific complexes, leading to the activation of Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pathways (8Ernst M.

However the identity of LIF-induced proteins in different cell contexts has not been precisely characterized. One major goal in this field is to identify LIF-dependent pathways in LIF-sensitive cell lines derived from the same founder cells in which LIF may trigger various effects. The most appropriate cells to study LIF signaling (which may satisfy these criteria) are the mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells. These cells are derived from the inner cell mass of blastocysts, and they remain pluripotent in vitro when maintained in the presence of LIF (13Brook F.A. Gardner R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Upon LIF withdrawal, ES cells differentiate heterogeneously into various cell types, and some of the cells die by apoptosis during the differentiation process (15Duval D. Reinhardt B. Kedinger C. Boeuf H. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 1577-1584Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). ES cells can also be induced to differentiate homogeneously into determined cell types (16Dinsmore J. Ratliff J. Deacon T.

They are classified into three families (extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs), c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs), and p38s) involved in cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptotic processes (21Marshall C.J.

The direct targets of ERKs (ERK1, ERK2, and ERK5) include kinases such as the Ser/Thr kinases of the families of mitogen/stress kinases (MSKs) and ribosomal S6 kinases (RSKs) (24Deak M. Clifton A.D.

These kinases are regulated by growth factors, cytokine, and stress and are involved in several biological processes including cell survival and proliferation (25Frodin M. Gammeltoft S. Mol. Cell.

The cAMP-responsive element-binding (CREB) transcription factor is activated by phosphorylation on Ser-133 by different pathways such as the cAMP-dependent protein kinase A, the nerve growth factor (NGF)-dependent p38 and ERK pathways, and the epidermal growth factor (EGF)-dependent RSK2 and MSK1 pathways (30Foulkes N.S.

Phosphorylation on Tyr-705 is essential for STAT3 DNA binding activity, whereas phosphorylation on Ser-727, a residue within the transactivation domain, is rather involved in transactivation processes (42Darnell Jr., J.E.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6963-6971Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Several observations suggest that MAP kinases are involved in STAT3 phosphorylation: (i) Ser-727 lies within a consensus MAPK recognition sequence (48Ihle J.N. Bioessays. 1996; 18: 95-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), and (ii) ERK2 is activated upon LIF treatment in ES cells (38Boeuf H. Hauss C. Graeve F.D. Baran N. Kedinger C. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 1207-1217Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). In addition, activation of the Ras/ERK pathway diminishes the requirement of LIF in ES cells (49Ernst M. Oates A.

To get insight into LIF signaling in mouse ES cells, we have followed the LIF-dependent phosphorylation profiles and DNA binding activities of the STAT3 transcription factor under different ES cell growth conditions: “pluripotent,” in the continuous presence of LIF; “reversibly differentiation-committed,” without LIF for 20 h, and “irreversibly differentiation-committed,” 48 h without LIF. We have also characterized the activation profile of MAPKs and identified new LIF targets (RSKs and CREB) regulated by ERKs, whose role in the maintenance of ES cell pluripotency is discussed under “Discussion.” Also, by using Ser/Thr kinase inhibitors, we have distinguished LIF-induced-ERK and PKC-dependent pathways. In addition, activation profiles of some of these LIF-induced proteins have also been studied in an ES-derived neuronal cell line that we have characterized as being a LIF-sensitive cell line. ES cells were derived from the inner cell mass of mouse blastocysts as described (54Hogan B.L. Beddington R. Costantini F. Lacy E. A Laboratory Manual. Second Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994: 255-272Google Scholar). The ES S1 cell line, grown in LIF-containing medium without feeder cells, was used in these experiments unless indicated. The ES H1 wild type (WT) and the derived ES H1RSK2− (X/Y cells in which the X-linkedrsk2 gene has been deleted by homologous recombination) were grown on feeder cells, in the presence of LIF (55Sassone-Corsi P.

In this RSK2− cell line, shortened mRNA corresponding to the in-frame skipping of exon 2 (in which the neomycine resistance gene and the stop codons were inserted) has been detected by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis, indicating that the RSK2− cell line used in this study may express a hypomorph allele of rsk2. However, no RSK2 protein was detected in this cell line under classical Western blot conditions.

Oncogene. 2000; 19: 4221-4229Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). When indicated, quantification of the signals has been performed with the Bio-Rad GS700 imaging densitometer by using Molecular Analyst, version 2.1, software. ES cells were grown in medium without LIF (10 ml/10-cm diameter Petri dish of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 4,5 g/l glucose, 10% FCS, 862 mg/ml glutamax, 0.1 mm β2-mercaptoethanol) for various time periods extending from 6 to 72 h and reinduced with LIF (1000 units/ml) up to cell lysis, which was performed 72 h after the beginning of the experiment. Apoptosis is scored by the appearance of a DNA ladder following DNA extraction by the Hirt procedure as described previously (15Duval D. Reinhardt B. Kedinger C. Boeuf H. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 1577-1584Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). S1 cells were grown in the continuous presence of LIF, and medium was changed every other day. Cell lysates were prepared without medium change or 15 min after LIF-containing medium addition (pluripotent conditions). ES cells grown without LIF for 20 h (differentiation-committed, reversible) or 48 h (differentiation-committed, irreversible) were re-fed with LIF-containing medium 15 min before harvesting. Cell lysates were prepared from cells grown under these different conditions. Neuronal differentiation of ES cells was mainly induced as described (16Dinsmore J. Ratliff J. Deacon T. Pakzaban P. Jacoby D. Galpern W. Isacson O. Cell Transplant. 1996; 5: 131-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. The S1 ES cell line was grown as embryoid bodies (300,000 cells/ml) on bacterial Petri dishes in Dulbecco's modified minimal essential medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 15% fetal calf serum (Hyclone), 0.1 mm β2 mercaptoethanol, 0.1% non-essential amino acids (Life Technologies, Inc.), 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.) in the presence of 10−6mall-trans-retinoic acid (Sigma). After 4 days of retinoic acid treatment, the embryoid bodies were trypsinized, and the cells were resuspended in the same medium. 40,000 cells/ml were then plated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium on coated culture dishes (for biochemical studies) or glass coverslips (for immunocytochemistry). Coating was performed successively with 0.1% gelatin, 10 μg/ml poly-d-lysine, and 1 μg/ml laminine. After 2 h, the culture medium was replaced by a defined medium (16Dinsmore J. Ratliff J. Deacon T. Pakzaban P. Jacoby D. Galpern W. Isacson O. Cell Transplant. 1996; 5: 131-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). The cell medium was changed every other day. LIF induction (30 min with 250 or 500 units of LIF/ml) was performed on homogeneous neuronal cell populations 4 days after plating. Cells (plated on glass-coated coverslips, coated as described above) fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (15 min) were treated with 3% H2O2 and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 (10 min). After preincubation with 10% normal goat serum for 30 min, cells were treated with rabbit antiserum directed against Neurofilament 200 (Sigma) diluted 1:100 or mouse antiserum directed against MAP1 (Sigma) diluted 1:300. Peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit and anti-mouse antibodies were used as secondary antibody, respectively. ES cells grown without LIF for 20 h were pretreated for 1 h with 50 μm H7 or various concentrations of U0126, before reinduction with LIF in the presence of the inhibitors, at the same concentrations. Cytosolic and nuclear cell lysates were prepared as described (57Sadowski H.B. Gilman M.Z. Nature. 1993; 362: 79-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Whole cell lysates were a mixture of cytosolic and nuclear lysates at a 2:1 ratio. Band shift experiments were performed with the nuclear lysates (30 μg) on the high affinity STAT3 DNA binding site of the c-fos promoter (c-Sis-induced element (SIE)) as described (38Boeuf H. Hauss C. Graeve F.D. Baran N. Kedinger C. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 1207-1217Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Nuclear or whole cell lysates were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electrotransferred onto nitrocellulose membranes in the presence of 0.07% SDS. Proteins were reacted with the different antibodies as recommended by the manufacturers. Mouse ES cells were grown in the continuous presence of LIF and were fed with fresh medium or passaged every other day. In the absence of LIF, ES cells are committed to differentiation. Analysis of the expression profile of genes know as pluripotent (rex-1,fgf4, esp) or “differentiated” cell markers (fgf-5) indicates that by 24 h of LIF withdrawal, cells are committed to differentiate (58Scherer C.A. Chen J. Nachabeh A. Hopkins N. Ruley H.E. Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 1393-1401PubMed Google Scholar, 59Ben-Shushan E. Thompson J.R. Gudas L.J. Bergman Y. Mol. Cell.

Reinhardt, C. Kedinger, and H. Boeuf, submitted for publication. In addition, ES cells grown without LIF for 48 h have lost their pluripotency, as suggested by their inability to colonize embryos (61Burdon T. Stracey C. Chambers I. Nichols J. Smith A. Dev. Biol. 1999; 210: 30-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). We have developed a quicker test to determine the point of irreversible commitment of cell differentiation when cells are grown in the absence of LIF. Based on our previous observation that during the differentiation process 30% of the cells are dying by apoptosis (15Duval D. Reinhardt B. Kedinger C. Boeuf H. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 1577-1584Crossref PubMed Google Scholar),2 we have set up an in vitro pluripotency test: cells were grown in the absence of LIF for different time periods (between 6 and 72 h) and then re-fed with LIF-containing medium up to 72 h before harvesting. Cells were scored for apoptosis by the appearance of a DNA ladder, a qualitative test that allows rapid detection of apoptotic cells (Fig. 1). The morphology of the cells and integrity of their DNA were unaltered when LIF was withdrawn for 24 h, compared with cells maintained in the continuous presence of LIF. By contrast, from 36 h onward after LIF withdrawal, ES cell clumps start to dissociate and cells begin to spread, reflecting the differentiation process. Meanwhile, dying cells were detected, and increasing proportions of DNA were degraded, indicating that some of the cells were dying by apoptosis. Therefore, we conclude that ES cells are irreversibly committed to differentiation and/or apoptosis starting at 36 h after LIF withdrawal. Based on this in vitro test, as well as on in vivo data (14Bradley A. Zheng B. Liu P. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 1998; 42: 943-950PubMed Google Scholar, 61Burdon T. Stracey C. Chambers I. Nichols J. Smith A. Dev. Biol. 1999; 210: 30-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar), we will refer throughout the document to pluripotent, reversibly differentiation-committed, or irreversibly differentiation-committed cells. STAT3 is critical for the maintenance of pluripotent ES cells as well as in various LIF-sensitive differentiated cells (38Boeuf H. Hauss C. Graeve F.D. Baran N. Kedinger C. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 1207-1217Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar,62Megeney L.A. Perry R.L.S. Lecouter J.E. Rudnicki M.A. Dev.

Circulation. 1998; 98: 346-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of STAT3 at the Tyr-705 residue is crucial for its activity in ES cells (11Niwa H. Burdon T. Chambers I. Smith A. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2048-2060Crossref PubMed Scopus (1227) Google Scholar, 38Boeuf H. Hauss C. Graeve F.D. Baran N. Kedinger C. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 1207-1217Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). It is also phosphorylated at the Ser-727 MAPK consensus site in response to various stimuli such as EGF or interleukin 6. We were interested to follow the STAT3 activation profile under experimental conditions as defined above. In these experiments, LIF was withdrawn for 20 or 48 h as a way to determine LIF-dependent STAT3 activation at a very early stage of differentiation commitment, whereas the process is still reversible (20 h after LIF withdrawal) as well as in irreversibly differentiation-committed cells (48 h after LIF withdrawal). Western blot analyses of nuclear extracts from ES cells grown under these conditions were performed using specific antibodies that recognize the activated STAT3 proteins phosphorylated on the Tyr-705 (P-Y705-STAT3) or Ser-727 (P-S727-STAT3) residues (Fig. 2). Phosphorylated STAT3 is detected in the continuous presence of LIF with a clear enhancement of the level of phosphorylation when fresh medium with LIF is added (Fig.2, Pluripotent cell growth conditions). By contrast, no phosphorylation on Tyr-705 and Ser-727 residues is detected in ES cells grown in the absence of LIF for 20 or 48 h. However, a rapid phosphorylation at both sites is induced upon LIF addition, indicating that these cells are still LIF-responsive (Fig. 2, Dif. com. at 20 h and Dif. com. at 48 h cell growth conditions). STAT3 phosphorylation is correlated with its specific DNA binding activity, as detected on the SIE probe in the Pluripotentand Dif. com. cells (Fig. 2). Protein-DNA complex formation on a LIF-unresponsive site was constitutive and unchanged in both cell types, indicating that cell extracts were equally functional (Ref. 38Boeuf H. Hauss C. Graeve F.D. Baran N. Kedinger C. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 1207-1217Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholarand data not shown). However, we noticed a reduction in the amount of STAT3-dependent DNA binding complexes formed in Dif. com. cells at 48 h upon LIF induction. Also, we have found that the cytosolic extracts (in which phosphorylated STAT3 could be detected (44Stephens J.M. Lumpkin S.J. Fishman J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31408-31416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar)) did not exhibit specific DNA binding activity, indicating that nuclear partners may stabilize the DNA-phospho-STAT3 complexes (data not shown). These results indicate that LIF-induced STAT3-dependent complexes, which include phosphorylated STAT3 proteins, are present in ES cells grown under the pluripotent and differentiation-committed cells. We have analyzed the activation profile of members of the three MAPK families (ERK, JNK, and p38) in ES cells. Western blot analysis of total cell lysates from ES cells maintained under various conditions was performed with antibodies against MAPKs that specifically recognize the activated dually phosphorylated forms of ERK1/ERK2 (P-ERK1/P-ERK2, P-ERKs), JNK1/JNK2 (P-JNK1/P-JNK2), and p38 (P-p38). As shown in Fig.3 A, the ERK1 and ERK2 proteins are induced by LIF in cells maintained in the presence of low or high serum concentrations, which is in good agreement with previous studies (38Boeuf H. Hauss C. Graeve F.D. Baran N. Kedinger C. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 1207-1217Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 49Ernst M. Oates A. Dunn A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30136-30143Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). However, MAPKs (as well as their targets, such as the RSK proteins) are serum-induced proteins (25Frodin M. Gammeltoft S. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1999; 151: 65-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar). Therefore, it was of interest to test the direct effect of serum and LIF independently because both are required for the proper growth of ES cells. 3H. Boeuf, D. Duval, B. Reinhardt, and C.

We were also interested in determining the sensitivity of the various LIF-dependent targets in the presence of the U0126 compound, a specific MAP/ERK kinase (MEK) inhibitor that acts downstream of MEK1 and MEK2, impairing phosphorylation of ERK1 and ERK2 at the specific TEY site (65Favata M.F.

https://openalex.org/W2026100048,"The pheromone-binding proteins (PBPs) are 16-kDa abundant proteins in specialized olfactory hairs in insects. The mechanism by which the PBPs remove the pheromone from the inner surface of sensory hairs and deliver it to the sensory cell remains unclear. Existing qualitative models postulate that pheromone is released near the dendrite by a decrease in pH or by a reduced form of the PBP. This study focuses on the two PBPs from the gypsy moth and the enantiomers of the pheromone cis-2-methyl-7,8-epoxyoctadecane. The pH dependence of pheromone binding has revealed three ionizations that are important. The type of ligand influences two of these ionizations. We propose that the (−)-enantiomer of the pheromone interacts with one of the ionizable residues on the protein while the (+)-enantiomer does not. Simultaneous variation of pH and KCl concentration in the physiological range or reduction of disulfide bridges does not change the affinity of PBP for pheromone. We propose a revised model of pheromone transport from the inner surface of the sensory hair to the sensory neuron."

Region 1 of molecular mass 71 kDa, which included the 113-residue N terminus along with the eight epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like repeats and CUB domains 1 and 2, and region 2 of molecular mass 37 kDa consisting of CUB domains 6–8 bound both intrinsic factor-cobalamin (vitamin B12; Cbl) (IF-Cbl) and albumin. Within these two regions, the binding of both ligands was confined to a 110–115-residue stretch that encompassed either the 113-residue N terminus or CUB domain 7 and 8. Ca2+ dependence of ligand binding or the ability of cubilin antiserum to inhibit ligand binding to the 113-residue N terminus was 60–65%. However, a combination of CUB domains 7 and 8 or 6–8 was needed to demonstrate significant Ca2+ dependence or inhibition of ligand binding by cubilin antiserum. Antiserum to EGF inhibited albumin but not IF-Cbl binding to the N-terminal cubilin fragment that included the eight EGF-like repeats. While the presence of excess albumin had no effect on binding to IF-Cbl, IF-Cbl in excess was able to inhibit albumin binding to both regions of cubilin. Reductive alkylation of the 113-residue N terminus or CUB 6–8, CUB 7, or CUB 8 domain resulted in the abolishment of ligand binding. These results indicate that (a) cubilin contains two distinct regions that bind both IF-Cbl and albumin and that (b) binding of both IF-Cbl and albumin to each of these regions can be distinguished and is regulated by the nonassisted formation of local disulfide bonds.

Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1999; 19: 173-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). IFCR isolated from canine ileal mucosa was estimated to have a molecular mass around 220 kDa and bound IF-Cbl with high affinity (2Seetharam B. Alpers D.H. Allen R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 3785-3790Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and further proteolysis of this receptor revealed that IF-Cbl binding occurred with a number of receptor fragments of molecular masses as low as 80 kDa (3Seetharam B. Bagur S.S. Alpers D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 183-189Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to the intestinal ileal mucosa, very high levels of IFCR were also detected in mammalian kidney (4Seetharam B. Levine J.S. Ramasamy M. Alpers D.H. J. Biol.

Acta. 1993; 1146: 243-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In contrast to canine ileal mucosal IFCR, the purified rat renal IFCR demonstrated a molecular mass of 457 kDa based on its amino acid and amino sugar content. It bound 2 mol of IF-Cbl (4Seetharam B. Levine J.S. Ramasamy M. Alpers D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4443-4449Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and like the yolk sac IFCR (5Ramanujam K.S. Seetharam S. Seetharam B. Biochim.

Although the physiological significance for the high levels of IFCR expression in the kidney was not known for a number of years, using proximal tubular polarized epithelial opossum kidney cells it was demonstrated that the apically expressed IFCR was able to internalize IF-Cbl and mediate Cbl transport from the apical to basolateral medium (7Ramanujam K.S. Seetharam S. Dahms N. Seetharam B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13135-13140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A later study using a canine model with selective inherited intestinal Cbl malabsorption syndrome (8Fyfe J.C. Ramanujam K.S. Ramaswamy K. Patterson D.F. Seetharam B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4489-4494Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated that in these animals the apical brush border membrane levels of IFCR in both ileal mucosa and kidney were depleted suggesting that the IFCR expressed in both tissues was a product of the same gene. Although it was thought for the last decade that the renal IFCR may have some other function, its structure was only recently delineated (9Moestrup S.K. Kozyraki R. Kristiansen M. Kaysen J.H.

These include IF-Cbl (1–2 nm) (4Seetharam B. Levine J.S. Ramasamy M. Alpers D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4443-4449Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), albumin (0.63 μm) (10Birn H.

The presence of low and high affinity binding sites for high density lipoprotein and light chain suggested that there are at least two binding sites for these ligands. Based on the recent elucidation of its sequence, IFCR is now renamed cubilin mainly because it consists of a contiguous stretch of 27 CUB domains that represent nearly 88% of its total mass of 460 kDa and because IF-Cbl binding has been shown to be localized to a region from CUB domain 5 to CUB domain 8 (14Kristiansen M.

A CUB domain is a 110–115-amino acid module present in developmentally regulated proteins that is known to form a β-barrel. The acronym CUB is derived from proteinscomplement Clr/Cls, Uegf, and bone morphogenic protein-1 that have these domains. Upstream of these CUB domains, the rest of the cubilin molecule contains a 113-residue N-terminal region followed by eight EGF-like repeats. Consistent with these structural observations, the new name of cubilin will be used instead of IFCR throughout the rest of the manuscript. Despite these studies many aspects of the structure-function relationship of cubilin are poorly understood, particularly its ability to function as a multifunctional receptor, and the current studies were directed in addressing some of these issues. The results of the current studies show that cubilin contains two distinct ligand binding regions, one the 113-residue N terminus and the other CUB domains 7 and 8 that bind both IF-Cbl and albumin. Binding of both these ligands to each of these regions can be distinguished and is regulated by the formation of local disulfide bond(s) that form spontaneously in the absence of molecular chaperones and exogenously added oxidized glutathione. Sepharose and rat serum albumin were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. pSec Tag B vector was from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA), and canine pancreatic microsomes and the TNT quick coupled transcription/translation system were from Promega (Madison, WI). Fluoro-HanceTM used for autoradiography was obtained from Research Products International Corp. (Mount Prospect, IL). Rat gastric intrinsic factor used in the current studies was purified from the rat stomach as described previously (15Seetharam B. Bakke J.E. Alpers D.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 115: 238-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Antiserum to purified rat renal cubilin raised in rabbits was prepared as described previously (4Seetharam B. Levine J.S. Ramasamy M. Alpers D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4443-4449Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Polyclonal antiserum to human EGF raised in rabbits was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Carrier-free Na125I for iodination of rat serum albumin and35S-Express protein labeling mix from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. IODO-GEN was from Pierce. Various cubilin fragments were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The amplified products were subcloned into the expression vector pSec Tag B. The following 13 constructs were subcloned and expressed: N terminus (113 residues) (bp 3–14, bp 369–340), N-EGF (bp 3–14, bp 1404–1420), N-EGF + CUB 1–2 (bp 3–14, bp 2104–1221), CUB 1–4 (bp 4120–4136, bp 2777–2793), CUB 9–12 (bp 4171–4188, bp 5530–5556) CUB 12–17 (bp 5212–5229, bp 7338–7353), CUB 18–27 (bp 7354–7369, bp 10852–10869), CUB 5 (bp 2794–2808, bp 3124–3141), CUB 6 (bp 3142–3156, bp 3476–3492), CUB 7 (bp 3493–3507, bp 3816–3831), CUB 8 (bp 3832–3846, bp 4153–4170), CUB 7–8 (bp 3453–3507, bp 4153–4170), and CUB 6–8 (bp 3142–3156, bp 4153–4170). The sequence of each PCR product obtained was confirmed to represent the correct amplified sequence prior to its use. The plasmids were transcribed and translated in vitro by TNT quick coupled transcription and translation system from Promega. The 35S-translated products were then used for further characterization. The constructs were transcribed and translated by the TNT quick coupled system as described by the manufacturer. In some experiments canine pancreatic microsomal membranes (1 μl) were added to study the cotranslational processing and post-translational modification of 35S-labeled rat cubilin fragments. To confirm the ability of the added pancreatic microsomes to carry out core N-glycosylation, mRNA encoding α-factor and, for processing, mRNA encoding pre-β-lactamase provided by the manufacturer were used as controls. Rat serum albumin was coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose, and rat gastric IF was coupled to Cbl-Sepharose. One milliliter of a 1:1 suspension in 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, of the Sepharose-linked ligands (albumin or IF-Cbl) was capable of binding to at least 500–700 ng of purified renal cubilin. The 35S-translated cubilin fragments (50,000–75,000 dpm) were incubated with 500 μl of a 1:1 suspension of Sepharose beads in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 10 mmCaCl2 or 10 mm EDTA. In some experiments, the labeled cubilin fragments were preincubated with 2–5 μl of polyclonal antiserum to either cubilin or EGF. For experiments shown in Figs. 7 and 8 the addition of 5 μl of the polyclonal antiserum to cubilin and EGF resulted in maximum inhibition of ligand binding, and the addition of a higher amount (10–25 μl) of the antisera did not inhibit ligand binding further. Using similar amounts (50,000 dpm) of protein synthesized from constructs CUB 7, CUB 8, or CUB 6–8, 5 μl of antiserum was sufficient to precipitate >90% of all three labeled proteins. Competition of ligand binding was carried out similarly except that the labeled cubilin fragments were preincubated for 60 min at 22 °C with either rat IF-Cbl (50 ng) or rat serum albumin (100 ng) prior to their binding to Sepharose linked to albumin or rat IF-Cbl, respectively. Following binding for 60 min, the beads were exhaustively washed with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 140 mm NaCl (15–20 ml), and radioactivity bound was then released by boiling the beads with SDS sample buffer and subjected to nonreducing SDS-PAGE.Figure 8SDS-PAGE of EGF antiserum-treated, affinity-purified N terminus cubilin fraction. Prior to purification, the translated 35S-labeled 113-residue N terminus + eight EGF-like repeats was treated with 5 μl of EGF antiserum for 60 min at 22 °C and then subjected to ligand affinity chromatography as indicated. The bound radioactivity was eluted and subjected to SDS-PAGE, and the bands were visualized by fluorography.

Levine J.S. Ramasamy M. Alpers D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4443-4449Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The Ca2+-dependent binding of ligand, IF-[57Co]Cbl (100–2500 pg), or 125I-rat serum albumin (10–200 ng) (specific activity, 200,000 dpm/μg of albumin) was determined using the rat renal membranes (25–50 μg of protein). The total ligand bound in the presence of 10 mmTris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, containing 10 mm CaCl2was subtracted from that bound in the presence of the same buffer but containing 10 mm EDTA to obtain Ca2+-specific ligand binding. Sequence alignment of the N-terminal region and CUB domains 7 and 8 were performed by Jellyfish version 1.4 using matrix-Gonnet. The various regions of cubilin that were amplified by reverse transcriptase PCR are shown in Fig. 1. Initially all cubilin fragments were in vitro transcribed and translated to test for their ability to synthesize a functional protein. Earlier studies (14Kristiansen M. Kozyraki R. Jacobsen C. Nexo E. Verroust P.J. Moestrup S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20540-20544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) had revealed that when the media collected from stably transfected cells were tested for IF-Cbl binding, only the media from cells transfected with CUB domains 5–8 bound IF-Cbl, and none of the other cubilin fragments demonstrated IF-Cbl binding activity. In our studies (Fig. 2), four cubilin fragments encompassing CUB domains 1–4, 9–12, 12–17, and 18–27 were efficiently translated in vitro (lanes 1) and produced major proteins of molecular masses 45, 47, 70, and 100 kDa, respectively, consistent with the number of CUB domains present in each fragment. Each CUB domain consists of 110–115 residues with an average polypeptide mass of around 110 kDa. The [35S]methionine-labeled proteins synthesized by these cubilin fragments failed to bind either IF-Cbl (lanes 2) or albumin (lanes 3). In contrast, the ∼71-kDa cubilin fragment synthesized (Fig. 3 A,lane 1) from the N-terminal fraction, which contained the 113-residue N-terminal region along with the eight EGF-like repeats and CUB 1-2 demonstrated Ca2+-dependent binding of both IF-Cbl (Fig. 3 B, lane 1) and albumin (Fig.3 C, lane 1). Within this region, the 113-residue N-terminal region, which synthesized a protein of ∼18 kDa (Fig. 3 A, lane 2) was by itself enough and sufficient to bind both IF-Cbl and albumin (Fig. 3, B andC, lanes 2). The cell-free translation of the 113-residue N terminus resulted in the synthesis of a predominant 18-kDa band, but there were three other bands of higher molecular mass (36, 39, and 44 kDa). These higher molecular mass forms may represent the aggregated forms of the 18-kDa form, and the size difference between them could be due to different amounts of Triton X-100 bound to them. This conclusion is based on the observation that all three forms bound both ligands. Prior incubation of the translated product with Sepharose alone did not eliminate these bands from the fraction that was eluted from ligand affinity matrix (data not shown). The DNA fragment encoding the eight EGF-like repeat region synthesized a protein of 45 kDa but did not bind either of the two ligands (data not shown). Since our earlier data (Fig. 2) had demonstrated that no ligand binding activity occurred with cubilin fragments synthesized downstream of CUB domain 9 and CUB domains 1–4, attention was focused to test ligand binding with cubilin fragments synthesized by CUB domains 5–8. While all of the individual CUB domains between 5 and 8 were able to synthesize protein products of molecular masses between 17 and 20 kDa (Fig. 4 A), only the proteins synthesized with CUB 7 and CUB 8 were able to bind both IF-Cbl (Fig.4 B) and albumin (Fig. 4 C). In addition, protein products of molecular mass 28 or 37 kDa synthesized from CUB 7-8 or 6–8, respectively, also bound both the ligands (Fig. 4, Band C). Lack of ligand binding (Fig. 4, B andC) observed by protein synthesized by CUB 5 or CUB 6 was not due to low levels of protein expressed by these constructs since the amount of 35S radioactivity used for affinity ligand binding was 3–4 times higher than that used for SDS-PAGE (Fig.4 A) analysis of the translated products. The two ligand binding regions of cubilin, the 113-residue N terminus, which included the eight EGF-like repeats along with CUB domains 1 and 2, and CUB domains 6–8 region contained three and five potentialN-glycosylation sites, respectively. Thus, we wanted to test whether these sites are utilized for N-glycosylation and if so, whether glycosylation at these site(s) affects ligand binding. Thus, these constructs were translated in vitro in the presence and absence of canine pancreatic microsomes. SDS-PAGE analysis (Fig. 5) failed to detect any shift in the electrophoretic mobility (Fig. 5 A) with either region 1 representing the N terminus + eight EGF-like repeats + CUB domains 1 and 2 (Fig. 5 A, compare mobility in lanes 3 and4) or region 2 containing CUB domains 6–8 (Fig.5 A, compare mobility in lanes 1 and2). Moreover, both regions of cubilin bound the ligands whether they were synthesized in the absence (Fig. 5, B andC, lanes 1) or the presence (Fig. 5, Band C, lanes 2) of pancreatic microsomes. Taken together, these observations suggested that under the experimental conditions used in the present studies these sites are notN-glycosylated and that the ligand binding is not affected when cell-free translation was carried out with the cotranslational addition of canine pancreatic microsomes. However, a positive control incubation to test the activity of the pancreatic microsomes indicated that under similar experimental conditions, Saccharomyces cerevisiae α-factor was processed with coreN-glycosylation (Fig. 5 A, compare mobilities oflanes 5 and 6) and that Escherichia coli β-lactamase is processed with cleavage of its signal peptide (Fig. 5 A, lanes 7 and8). These observations indicated that the lack of coreN-glycosylation of the cubilin fragments was not due to the use of an inactive sample of canine pancreatic microsomes. The binding of IF-Cbl to its receptor is Ca2+-dependent, but it is not known whether the dependence on Ca2+ for ligand binding is a property of the full-length receptor or can be demonstrated with functionally active regions of cubilin. To address this issue, the binding of 35S-labeled cubilin fragments were tested for Ca2+ dependence of binding to both IF-Cbl and albumin (Fig. 6). The binding of IF-Cbl and albumin to native renal brush border membrane was inhibited by EDTA by 97 and 50%, respectively. EDTA-inhibitable binding of IF-Cbl and albumin to region 1 encompassing only the 113-residue N-terminal region of cubilin was 64 and 70%, respectively. Interestingly, the inclusion of eight EGF-like repeats with the 113-residue N terminus resulted in the abolishment of Ca2+dependence for albumin binding, but the binding of IF-Cbl was 50% Ca2+-dependent. In contrast, both CUB domains 7 and 8 bound IF-Cbl and albumin but demonstrated only 5–8% Ca2+ dependence for the binding of both ligands. Although the total ligand bound (Fig. 6, dotted line) did not significantly change, CUB 7-8 or CUB 6–8 demonstrated an increased Ca2+ dependence for both ligands. Ca2+-dependent binding of both IF-Cbl and albumin to CUB 7-8 was about 50%. While inclusion of CUB 6 further increased the Ca2+ dependence of IF-Cbl binding by an additional 40–45% to almost 95%, it had no additional effect on Ca2+ dependence of albumin binding by CUB 7-8. Polyclonal antiserum to rat renal cubilin was able to inhibit by 58–64% (Fig. 7) IF-Cbl and albumin binding to the 113-residue N terminus. However, it inhibited by 10, 25, and 60% the binding of IF-Cbl to CUB 7, CUB 8, and CUB 6–8, respectively. On the other hand, the binding of albumin to CUB 7 and CUB 8 was inhibited between 55 and 60% and reached 95% for CUB 6–8 (Fig. 7). Studies with antiserum to EGF (Fig.8), which is relevant to only region 1, revealed inhibition of albumin binding by nearly 90%, while it had very little or no effect on IF-Cbl binding to this region. To examine whether the two protein ligands compete for binding, binding of one ligand was carried out after a preincubation of the35S-labeled cubilin fragments with the other ligand. Preincubation with excess albumin did not inhibit the binding of IF-Cbl by either the 113-residue or the CUB 6–8 fragment (Fig.9). On the other hand, when similar experiments were carried out with preincubation in the presence of IF-Cbl, the binding of albumin by both regions of cubilin was inhibited by >90–95%. Sequence analysis of the 113-residue N-terminal ligand binding region of cubilin revealed two cysteine residues (Fig.10) suggesting the potential formation of only one disulfide bond in this region. On the other hand, sequence alignment of the individual CUB domains 7 and 8 revealed (Fig. 10) the presence of four cysteine residues in each one of these CUB domains present at identical positions. To test whether local disulfide bonds were formed following translation of the two functional regions of cubilin and to further examine whether the disulfide bonding is required for ligand binding, the labeled translated fragments were subjected to reductive alkylation and ligand binding. SDS-PAGE analysis (Fig. 11) revealed that following reductive alkylation, the electrophoretic mobility of the translated 113-residue N-terminal region decreased (lane 2) relative to the unreduced sample (lane 1). In addition, while the nonreduced N-terminal protein bound both IF-Cbl (lane 3) and albumin (lane 5), reduction of the only disulfide bond formed between Cys-63 and Cys-117 destroyed binding of both ligands (lanes 4 and6). Formation of a disulfide bond(s) as revealed by decreased electrophoretic mobility was also evident with the cubilin fragment encoded by CUB 6–8 (lanes 1 and 2). Reductive alkylation inactivated binding of both IF-Cbl (lane 4) and albumin (lane 6) relative to the binding obtained with the nonreduced forms (lanes 3 and5). Reductive alkylation of these two cubilin regions synthesized in the presence or absence of canine pancreatic microsomes also revealed an identical shift in the mobility of the reduced forms of cubilin fragments (data not shown). To further confirm whether the loss of ligand binding due to disruption of disulfide bonding in region 2 (CUB 6–8) is due to loss of intra- or inter-CUB domain disulfide bonds, reductive alkylation of individual CUB domains was carried out. SDS-PAGE analysis of the labeled proteins revealed (Fig. 12) that CUB domains 7 and 8, which bind the ligand, demonstrated disulfide bonding, and upon reductive alkylation, ligand binding to both these CUB domains was completely inhibited (data not shown). However, CUB domains 5 and 6, which do not bind the ligand (Fig. 4), revealed the presence of disulfide bonding in CUB 5 but not CUB 6. These observations indicated that intramolecular disulfide bonds within CUB 7 or CUB 8 are important for ligand binding. Cubilin is a 460-kDa multidomain, multifunctional endocytic receptor expressed in the apical membranes of tissue epithelial cells and functions synergistically (16Christensen E.I. Birn H. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: F562-F573Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with megalin, another endocytic receptor of molecular mass 660 kDa. For an endocytic receptor, cubilin is unique in that it has no discernable transmembrane domain (9Moestrup S.K. Kozyraki R. Kristiansen M. Kaysen J.H. Rasmussen H.H. Brault D. Pontillon F. Goda F.O.

The catalytic protein subunit of telomerase, known generically as telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT), exhibits significant homology to RTs encoded by retroviruses and retroelements. The polymerization mechanisms of telomerase may therefore be similar to those of the “conventional” RTs. In this study, we explored the extent of mechanistic conservation by analyzing mutations of conserved residues within the putative “finger” domain of TERT. Previous analysis has implicated this domain of retroviral RTs in nucleotide and RNA binding and in processivity control. Our results demonstrate that residues conserved between TERT and human immunodeficiency virus-1 RT are more likely than TERT-specific residues to be required for enzyme activity. In addition, residues presumed to make direct contact with either the RNA or nucleotide substrate appear to be functionally more important. Furthermore, distinct biochemical defects can be observed for alterations in the putative RNA- and nucleotide-binding TERT residues in a manner that can be rationalized by their postulated mechanisms of action. This study thus supports a high degree of mechanistic conservation between telomerase and retroviral RTs and underscores the roles of distinct aspects of telomerase biochemistry in telomere length maintenance.

In addition, the same tyrosine residue in conserved motif A allows both TERT and RTs to discriminate against incorporating ribonucleotides (30Miller M.C. Liu J.K. Collins K. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4412-4422Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). However, some other crucial RT residues (e.g. Gln in motif B′) appear to be less important or even dispensable in telomerase (9Lingner J. Hughes T.R. Shevchenko A. Mann M. Lundblad V. Cech T.R. Science. 1997; 276: 561-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (1040) Google Scholar). Together, these results suggest that despite the high degree of sequence divergence (<20% sequence identity), TERT and conventional RTs may possess very similar polymerization mechanisms. We have sought to clarify the extent of mechanistic conservation between TERT and conventional RTs by comparative analysis of HIV-1 RT and Saccharomyces cerevisiae TERT properties. Specifically, we mutagenized S. cerevisiae TERT residues that, according to alignment and the structure of the HIV-1 RT-substrate complex (31Huang H. Chopra R. Verdine G.L. Harrison S.C. Science. 1998; 282: 1669-1675Crossref PubMed Scopus (1358) Google Scholar), are presumed to mediate important aspects of the polymerization reaction. We then subjected the resulting telomerase to detailed biochemical and genetic analysis. Previous studies (29Peng Y. Mian I.S. Lue N.F. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1201-1211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) focused on regions of S. cerevisiae TERT equivalent to the “palm” and “thumb” domains of HIV-1 RT and revealed striking similarities between these enzymes with respect to processivity control. Specifically, conserved motifs C and E and a C-terminal extension, all previously demonstrated to be processivity determinants of HIV-1 RT, were found to govern processivity of S. cerevisiae TERT as well. In addition, a correlation was demonstrated between telomerase processivity and the equilibrium length of telomeres (29Peng Y. Mian I.S. Lue N.F. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1201-1211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), suggesting a causal relationship between the two parameters. In this study, we undertook a more detailed analysis of the putative “finger” domain of S. cerevisiae TERT, presumed to function in nucleotide and template binding. Residues believed to interact with the nucleotide substrate and the RNA template were mutated, and the resulting telomerase was subjected to biochemical and genetic analysis. Consistent with a high degree of mechanistic similarity, we show that residues conserved betweenS. cerevisiae TERT and HIV-1 RT are more likely than TERT-specific residues to be required for enzyme activity. In addition, altering residues that are presumed to make direct contact with either the RNA or nucleotide substrate caused greater physiologic defects. Clear functional differences can be observed between the RNA- and nucleotide-interacting TERT residues in a manner that can be rationalized by their postulated mechanisms of action. Our observations also underscore the importance of telomerase processivity in controlling telomere length. The construction of a Δest2 strain harboring the pSE-Est2-C874 plasmid (containing a protein A-tagged EST2 gene) has been described (32Xia J. Peng Y. Mian I.S. Lue N.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5196-5207Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). All point mutations in the finger domain ofEST2 were generated using the QuickChange protocol (Stratagene), appropriate primer oligonucleotides, and pSE-Est2-C874 as template. All point mutations were confirmed by sequencing. The oligodeoxynucleotide primers used for telomerase assays were purchased from Sigma and were purified by denaturing gel electrophoresis prior to use. Whole cell extracts and IgG-Sepharose-purified telomerase were prepared as previously described (29Peng Y. Mian I.S. Lue N.F. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1201-1211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 32Xia J. Peng Y. Mian I.S. Lue N.F. Mol. Cell.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1487-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Each primer extension assay was carried out using 20 μl of IgG-Sepharose pretreated with 4 mg of protein extract and was initiated by the addition of a 15-μl mixture containing 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 4 mmmagnesium chloride, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mmspermidine, 10 μm primer oligodeoxynucleotides, and varying combinations of labeled and unlabeled dGTP and dTTP. Primer extension products were processed and analyzed by gel electrophoresis as previously described (34Lue N.F. Peng Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1487-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 35Lue N.F. Xia J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1495-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). All assays were performed in duplicates or triplicates to allow for determination of averages and deviations. For determination of processivity, the signal for each product was determined by a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Inc.) and normalized to the amount of transcript by dividing by the number of labeled residues. Both the TEL15 and TEL66 primers were designed such that they can align to only one site along the yeast RNA template and support the addition of a specific sequence (TGTGGTG). The processivity for each position (P i) was calculated using the following formula: P i = sum(T i +1 +T i +2 + … +T n)/sum(T i +T i +1 + … +T n), where T i designates the amount of transcript calculated for the P+i position, andn designates the highest number such that a visible signal can be discerned in the PhosphorImager file for the P+nproduct. IgG-Sepharose-enriched telomerase was prepared as described above and deproteinated by SDS and proteinase K treatment and phenol extraction. The remaining nucleic acids were combined with an antisense probe (100,000 cpm) and hybridized and digested as previously described (36Lue N.F. Kornberg R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8839-8843Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). For synthesis of uniformly labeled RNA probe, the TLC1 gene (nucleotides 1–1301) (37Singer M.S. Gottschling D.E. Science. 1994; 266: 404-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar) was first amplified by polymerase chain reaction and cloned in between the BamHI and EcoRV sites of pBluescript II KS+. The resulting plasmid was linearized by digestion withHinfI, and antisense RNA encompassing residues 1097–1301 of the TLC1 gene was generated by T3 RNA polymerase in the presence of 12 μm [α-32P]GTP as described (36Lue N.F. Kornberg R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8839-8843Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). To clarify the extent of mechanistic conservation between retroviral RTs and TERT, we mutagenized residues in the finger domain of yeast TERT (Est2p) that are conserved either within the TERT family or within the larger RT family and tested the resulting polypeptides for function both in vitro and in vivo. In a published comparative sequence analysis of RTs (50Xiong Y. Eickbush T.H. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3353-3362Crossref PubMed Scopus (1128) Google Scholar), the finger domain comprises RT motifs 1 and 2, located in close proximity and each consisting of ∼3–5 highly conserved amino acid residues (Fig.1 A). In atomic resolution structural models of HIV-1 RT, motifs 1 and 2 constitute a long β-hairpin, the base of which contacts the templating and surrounding bases and the tip of which interacts with the deoxynucleotide triphosphate. Based on an alignment of HIV-1 RT and nine TERTs in this region (Fig. 1 A), we chose 5 residues in Est2p for mutagenesis and detailed biochemical analysis: Lys437(which is moderately conserved among TERTs, but not in RTs) and Ile441, Lys443, Arg450, and Ile452 (which are conserved between TERTs and RTs). Of the four “universally” conserved residues, Lys443 (the equivalent of Lys65 in HIV-1 RT) and Arg450(the equivalent of Arg72) are presumed to contact the γ- and α-phosphates of the nucleotide substrate, respectively; Ile452 (the equivalent of Leu74) is presumed to stack against the templating base; and Ile441 (the equivalent of Ile63) is to make no direct contact with the substrates (Fig. 1 B). Four of the five mutations (K437A, I441A, K443A, and I452A) are alanine substitutions, whereas one (R450K) is a conservative change, altering an invariant arginine to lysine. Each mutant was tagged at the C terminus with tandem copies of the IgG-binding domain of protein A, placed on a centromeric plasmid, and used to complement a yeast strain whose chromosomal EST2gene has been disrupted. A similarly tagged wild-type EST2gene was tested in parallel as the control. Interestingly, only the K443A and R450K mutants failed to support normal yeast growth (data not shown). Strains carrying wild-type Est2p and the other three mutants grew normally on plates and in liquid medium. Analysis of telomere lengths yielded largely congruent results, with the K443A and R450K strains exhibiting severe telomere shortening; the I452A strain exhibiting moderate shortening; and the K437A, I441A, and wild-type strains exhibiting normal telomere lengths (Fig.2 A). To determine whether altered protein expression can explain the physiologic defects observed in the finger mutants, we prepared extracts from the respective strains and performed immunoblotting studies using antibodies directed against the protein A tag. As show in Fig.2 B, approximately equivalent amounts of the wild-type protein and each of the mutant proteins were detected in the assay, indicating no defect in protein expression. Because the finger domain has been implicated in RNA binding, we also measured the level of Est2p-associated telomerase RNA (TLC1) using an RNase protection assay. As shown in Fig. 2 C, nearly identical amounts of TLC1 RNA were obtained from each extract in the IgG-Sepharose precipitate, consistent with normal ribonucleoprotein formation in both the wild-type and mutant strains. These results are in agreement with previous studies indicating that stable TERT-RNA binding is mediated primarily by N-terminal TERT-specific motifs that lie outside of the RT domain (38Lai C.K. Mitchell J.R. Collins K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 990-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 39Bryan T.M. Goodrich K.J. Cech T.R. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 493-499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 40Bachand F. Autexier C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1888-1897Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The normal levels of Est2p and Est2p-associated TLC1 RNA suggest that the functionally defective finger mutants may have enzymatic deficiency. To address this possibility, protein A-tagged telomerase from the wild-type and mutant strains was affinity-purified by specific adsorption to IgG-Sepharose and tested in primer extension assays (32Xia J. Peng Y. Mian I.S. Lue N.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5196-5207Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar,41Friedman K.L. Cech T.R. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2863-2874Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Previous studies indicate that the tag has no effect on telomerase function and that labeled products derived from this procedure are almost entirely sensitive to RNase pretreatment, a hallmark of telomerase. Two primers were utilized for the assays: TEL15 (TGTGTGGTGTGTGGG), which consists of canonical yeast telomere repeats, and TEL66 (TAGGGTAGTAGTAGGG), which consists of heterologous repeats. The heterologous primer binds telomerase less stably, but supports greater overall DNA synthesis, most likely because of higher enzyme turnover (35Lue N.F. Xia J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1495-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In addition, different combinations of labeled and unlabeled nucleotides (present at 0.2 and 33 μm, respectively) were used to differentiate between general and nucleotide-specific effects of mutations. (It was necessary to keep the labeled nucleotide at relatively low concentrations to maximize its specific activity). As shown in Figs. 3 and 4, in standard reactions, the K443A and R450K mutants exhibited the greatest reduction in overall DNA synthesis. The defects were observed regardless of the primer or combination of labeled and unlabeled nucleotides. However, the two mutations appear to have a slightly different impact on nucleotide usage. With the TEL15 oligonucleotide as primer, the K443A mutant reproducibly supported greater DNA synthesis in the presence of low dTTP concentrations, whereas the R450K mutant was slightly more active in the presence of low dGTP concentrations (Fig.4 A). A more extensive set of assays was carried out using the TEL66 primer and varying concentrations of labeled dGTP or labeled dTTP (at 0.2, 0.7, and 3.2 μm) (Fig. 4, B and C). At higher concentrations of labeled nucleotides, the K443A and R450K mutants supported significantly higher levels of DNA synthesis (by as much as 7–10-fold). However, both mutants continued to exhibit the most severe defects in overall activity and to exhibit different preferences for low concentrations of dGTP and dTTP. These results imply a critical role for Lys443 and Arg450 in yeast telomerase activity and nucleotide utilization, consistent with their putative function in contacting (and perhaps positioning) the nucleotide substrate. The loss of overall activity upon mutating these residues is also consistent with the observed telomere maintenance defects.Figure 4Effects of Est2p mutations on overall DNA synthesis in vitro. A, the overall levels of DNA synthesis mediated by the mutant enzymes relative to wild-type telomerase using the TEL15 primer are plotted. Two different combinations of labeled and unlabeled nucleotides were tested, with the labeled nucleotide being present at 0.2 μm. B, the overall levels of DNA synthesis mediated by the mutant enzymes relative to wild-type telomerase using the TEL66 primer in the presence of increasing concentrations of labeled dGTP are plotted. C, the overall levels of DNA synthesis mediated by the mutant enzymes relative to wild-type telomerase using the TEL66 primer in the presence of increasing concentrations of labeled dTTP are plotted.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In contrast to K443A and R450K, the K437A, I441A, and I452A mutants supported nearly normal levels of DNA synthesis, such that the increase or decrease was no more than 50% compared with the wild-type enzyme (Figs. 3 and 4). This observation held true regardless of the primer or combination of labeled and unlabeled nucleotides. The moderate decrease in overall activity of the I452A mutant (in assays utilizing the TEL66 primer) appears to be insufficient to account for its telomere maintenance defect, especially in light of the nearly normal telomere length of the I441A mutant, which exhibited a comparably moderate decrease in overall activity. The I452A mutant may therefore suffer from a defect that is not readily apparent in total activity measurements (see below). Several nucleotide- and RNA-binding residues in the finger domain of HIV-1 RT have been implicated in processivity control (51Sarafianos S. Pardey V. Kaushik N. Modek M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19729-19735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 52Harris D. Kaushik N. Pandey P. Yadav P. Pandey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33624-33637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). To investigate if this is applicable to telomerase, we quantitatively determined processivity of the wild-type and mutant enzymes at multiple positions along the template. Because the primer used for these assays (TEL66) ends in 3 G residues, it can align only with the RNA template in one registry, allowing the addition of a defined sequence (TGTGGTG). In turn, this enables one to determine the amount of transcripts at each extension position (by normalizing the intensity signals to the number of labeled residues) and consequently processivity at each position. Different combinations of labeled nucleotide (present at 0.2, 0.7, and 3.2 μm) and unlabeled nucleotide (present at 33 μm) were tested to differentiate between general and nucleotide-specific effects of mutations on processivity. For ease of description and visualization, only processivity at selected positions near the start of extension is plotted in Fig.5. Several general observations can be made through this quantitative analysis. First, the absolute value of processivity is dependent upon the extension position along the RNA template. Second, the effects of mutations on processivity are position-specific. Third, the nucleotide concentration dependence of processivity is position-specific. All these observations are consistent with previous studies (29Peng Y. Mian I.S. Lue N.F. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1201-1211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), 2D. Bosoy and N. Lue, submitted for publication. and with the notion that telomerase may exhibit conformational heterogeneity as its active site moves along the RNA template, resulting in different extension properties (e.g. processivity and rate constant) at different positions. Different mutations in the putative finger domains of telomerase caused distinct processivity defects. The two mutants that exhibited the shortest telomeres and the lowest levels of total activity (K443A and R450K) also had the most severe processivity defects. The defects were especially evident at the P+2 position (where P is primer; often a 2-fold or greater loss of processivity) and were present regardless of the combination of nucleotides used (Fig. 5, B andC). Increasing the concentration of the labeled nucleotide from 0.2 to 0.7 or 3.2 μm failed to improve the processivity of these two mutants. The other mutant with greatly shortened telomeres (I452A) had a milder processivity defect that was especially evident at the P+3 position in the presence of labeled dGTP and unlabeled dTTP. In contrast to the K443A and R450K mutants, the processivity of the I452A mutant could be significantly improved by increasing the concentration of the labeled nucleotide (by more than 2-fold) (Fig. 5, B and D). The two mutants with no telomere maintenance defects (K437A and I441A) also exhibited slight reductions in processivity at certain positions with some combinations of nucleotides (e.g. the I441A mutant at the P+2 position in 0.2 μm dTTP). However, neither showed significant defects when the labeled nucleotide was present at 3.2 μm. A relatively unique property of telomerase, among the family of RTs, is its ability to carry out primer cleavage. This nuclease activity appears to be conserved through evolution, although its physiologic function is not well understood. The activity is displayed by Tetrahymena telomerase reconstituted in rabbit reticulocyte lysate with just the TERT and RNA subunits and is thus likely to be mediated by one or both of these core components. In analyzing the primer extension activity of the telomerase mutants, we noticed that the R450K mutant appears to preferentially yield labeled products that can arise only from the combined action of nucleolytic cleavage and nucleotide addition. Specifically, with the combination of labeled dG and unlabeled dT, telomerase should incorporate radioactivity into the extension products starting at the P+2 position. Consistent with this expectation, the relative intensities of the P and P+1 products for wild-type telomerase and most of the telomerase mutants were quite low (Fig.6 A) (data not shown). In contrast, a significant fraction of the products for the R450K mutants migrated to the P and P+1 positions (marked by triangles), implying a relative increase in the action of the nuclease. Such an increase was not evident in the case of the K443A mutant (Fig.6 A). Quantitative analysis indicated that at low-to-moderate dGTP concentrations (0.2–3.2 μm), the fraction of the P and P+1 products was consistently higher (∼5-fold) for the R450K mutant than for the wild-type enzyme (Fig. 6 B). Indeed, with increasing dGTP concentrations, the relative intensities of the two shorter products became stronger, whereas the relative intensity of the P+3 product became weaker (marked by diamonds), suggesting a correlation between decreased processivity and increased cleavage. Preferential cleavage was not evident with the R450K mutant in the presence of labeled dT and unlabeled dG, possibly because the extremely low levels of DNA synthesis make it difficult to detect cleavage events (data not shown). Our results support the functional significance of sequence conservation between TERT and conventional RTs in the finger domain. In terms of physiologic requirement, residues absolutely conserved between TERT and other RTs are most essential (Lys443 and Arg450); residues tolerant of conservative substitutions are less important (Ile441 and Ile452); and a TERT-specific residue is more or less dispensable for telomerase function. The functional requirements are likely to be due to conserved structure and molecular mechanisms because residues believed to make direct contact with the substrates are shown to have greater importance both in vitro andin vivo (e.g. compare I441A and I452A mutants). Sequence alignment between TERT and conventional RTs thus appears to be an efficacious way of identifying important functional residues in telomerase. Because both Lys443 and Arg450 are absolutely conserved and presumed to make direct contact with the nucleotide substrate, the impact of mutations of these residues on telomerase activity is readily comprehended. The K443A and R450K mutants exhibited a severe defect in both overall DNA synthesis and a defect in processivity at selected positions. Increasing the nucleotide concentration in the assays only slightly improved overall DNA synthesis without improving processivity. These results can be interpreted in terms of reduced binding of nucleotide and failure to properly position the nucleotide for polymerase chemistry. The differential effects of low dGTP and dTTP concentrations on the activity of the two mutants (Figs. 3 and 4) suggest that the mutations may differentially impact on the binding/positioning of these two nucleotides. Studies of the corresponding HIV-1 RT residues (Lys65 and Arg72) yielded similar although not identical results (43Sluis-Cremer N. Arion D. Kaushik N. Lim H. Parniak M.A. Biochem. J. 2000; 1: 77-82Crossref Google Scholar,44Harris D. Kaushik N. Pandey P.K. Yadav P.N. Pandey V.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33624-33634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Both residues are required for optimal total DNA synthesis and enzyme processivity. The K65A mutation caused differential alterations in the enzyme's K m for different nucleotides, consistent with the mutation's having different impact on the binding of distinct nucleotides (43Sluis-Cremer N. Arion D. Kaushik N. Lim H. Parniak M.A. Biochem. J. 2000; 1: 77-82Crossref Google Scholar). However, the effect of alanine substitution at Lys65 on DNA synthesis and processivity appears to be much milder than that at Arg72 (44Harris D. Kaushik N. Pandey P.K. Yadav P.N. Pandey V.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33624-33634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Alanine substitution of Ile452 in Est2p caused a slight defect in overall DNA synthesis and a moderate defect in telomerase processivity, both of which can be rationalized in terms of the location of the corresponding residue (Leu74) in HIV-1 RT. In the covalently trapped catalytic complex of HIV-1 RT, Leu74 appears to “lock the templating base tightly in place” (Fig. 1 B) (31Huang H. Chopra R. Verdine G.L. Harrison S.C. Science. 1998; 282: 1669-1675Crossref PubMed Scopus (1358) Google Scholar). The residue also contacts other side chains that bind dNTP directly. Thus, the defects of the I452A mutation may be due to altered template or nucleotide interactions. Indeed, a somewhat more conservative L74V substitution in HIV-1 RT has been shown to result in decreased processivity and resistance to didanosine (45Sharma P.L. Crumpacker C.S. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 8448-8456Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), consistent with findings in TERT. In contrast to Lys443, Arg450, and Ile452, the residues in HIV-1 RT that correspond to Lys437 (possibly Pro59) and Ile441(Ile63) do not appear to contact either the template or nucleotide. Under some in vitro assay conditions, both the K437A and I441A mutants can exhibit a slight defect in total DNA synthesis and/or processivity. These mutations may cause defects indirectly by altering the conformation or function of surrounding residues. These mild in vitro defects have no apparent physiologic manifestations under normal growth conditions. Several conserved residues in the finger domain ofTetrahymena TERT have been analyzed by the reticulocyte lysate reconstitution system (30Miller M.C. Liu J.K. Collins K. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4412-4422Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In particular, residues corresponding to Lys437, Lys443, and Arg450 of Est2p have all been mutated and tested in thisin vitro system (Lys532, Lys538, and Arg543 in Tetrahymena TERT, respectively). Curiously, in contrast to the yeast results, total nucleotide incorporation was not greatly reduced (<3-fold) by any of theTetrahymena mutations. However, consistent with the yeast results, both the K538A and R543K mutants exhibited significant reductions in enzyme processivity, with the latter manifesting a specific inability to copy the 5′-end of the template. Overall, this study of the finger domain mutations reveals a great deal of mechanistic conservation between telomerase and retroviral RTs. Other motifs/domains of TERT and retroviral RTs are also likely to be mechanistically similar according to earlier biochemical and genetic analysis of the palm and thumb domains of Est2p and biochemical analysis of in vitro reconstituted Tetrahymenaand human telomerase (9Lingner J. Hughes T.R. Shevchenko A. Mann M. Lundblad V. Cech T.R. Science. 1997; 276: 561-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (1040) Google Scholar, 18Weinrich S.L. Pruzan R. Ma L. Ouellette M. Tesmer V.M. Holt S.E. Bodnar A.G. Lichtsteiner S. Kim N.W. Trager J.B. Taylor R.D. Carlos R. Andrews W.H. Wright W.E. Shay J.W. Harley C.B. Morin G.B. Nat.

Thus, despite the very limited sequence conservation, the molecular mechanisms of these two classes of RTs appear to be highly conserved. Because retroviral RTs and TERTs are evolutionarily distant, this conclusion further suggests that other classes of RTs (e.g. long terminal repeat retrotransposon RTs, non-long terminal repeat element RTs, and group II intron RTs) may be mechanistically quite similar as well (46Eickbush T.H. Science. 1997; 277: 911-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 47Nakamura T.M. Cech T.R. Cell. 1998; 92: 587-590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). As described above, the R450K mutant appears to preferentially yield labeled products that can arise only from the combined action of nucleolytic cleavage and nucleotide addition. Although a number of telomerase RNA mutations have been reported to alter primer cleavage, this appears to be the first example of a protein mutation with such an effect. The greatly reduced processivity of the R450K mutant suggests a potential link between enzyme processivity and aberrant cleavage, as has been proposed earlier (48Bhattacharyya A. Blackburn E.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2823-2827Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). However, the effect of the R450K mutation appears to be quite specific in that it is evident only with the combination of labeled dGTP and unlabeled dTTP nucleotides (Figs. 3 and 6). In addition, many other processivity mutants of Est2p do not manifest altered cleavage (e.g. a C-terminal truncation mutant) (29Peng Y. Mian I.S. Lue N.F. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1201-1211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Despite a great deal of analysis, the molecular basis for the cleavage activity of telomerase remains elusive. The selective effect of a nucleotide-binding residue and the effects of many RNA template mutations on cleavage property support a close physical interaction between the two activities of telomerase (42Ware T.L. Wang H. Blackburn E.H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3119-3131Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 49Prescott J. Blackburn E.H. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 528-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W2052887726,"Phosphoglycolate phosphatase (PGPase), a key enzyme of photorespiration in photosynthetic organisms, was purified from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. The enzyme was an ∼65-kDa homodimer with a pI value of 5.1 composed of ∼32-kDa subunits not connected by any S–S bridges. It was also highly specific for phosphoglycolate with a K m value of 140 μm and an optimal pH between 8 and 9. The activity was strongly inhibited by CaCl2, and it recovered competitively following the addition of MgCl2 or EGTA. A mobility shift was observed in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis by the addition of CaCl2, indicating that the enzyme binds to Ca2+. The N-terminal region of amino acid sequence deduced from cDNA sequence that was not contained in the purified PGPase had similar characteristics to those of typical stroma-targeting transit peptides in C. reinhardtii. The following region of the deduced sequence containing 302 amino acid residues was similar top-nitrophenylphosphatase-like proteins, although the purified PGPase did not hydrolyze p-nitrophenylphosphate. Genomic DNA fragments from wild type containing the sequence homologous to the cDNA for PGPase complemented the PGPase-deficient mutantpgp1. Possible regulatory mechanisms during adaptation to limiting CO2 were discussed based on the characteristics of the purified PGPase and the deduced amino acid sequence. Phosphoglycolate phosphatase (PGPase), a key enzyme of photorespiration in photosynthetic organisms, was purified from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. The enzyme was an ∼65-kDa homodimer with a pI value of 5.1 composed of ∼32-kDa subunits not connected by any S–S bridges. It was also highly specific for phosphoglycolate with a K m value of 140 μm and an optimal pH between 8 and 9. The activity was strongly inhibited by CaCl2, and it recovered competitively following the addition of MgCl2 or EGTA.

This is most likely because phosphoglycolate, which accumulates during photosynthesis under ambient air (4Suzuki K. Mamedov T.G. Ikawa T. Plant Cell Physiol. 1999; 40: 792-799Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar), strongly inhibits the enzyme triosephosphate isomerase (5Wolfenden R.

(Bethesda). 1991; 95: 693-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). PGPase has also been partially purified from components of animal tissues such as human red blood cells (15Zecher R. Schwuléra U. Wolf H.U. Int. J. Biochem. 1982; 14: 775-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The remarkable similarity in the kinetic characteristics of these animal PGPases to those of plant PGPases has been described previously (16Rose Z.B. Grove D.S. Seal S.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 10996-11002Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). No information, however, is available on the molecular structure (e.g. amino acid sequences) in eukaryotes. The regulatory mechanism of PGPase activity is still not clear in any organisms, although some observations suggest environmental regulation by such factors as CO2 concentration (3Suzuki K. Marek L.F. Spalding M.H. Plant Physiol. (Bethesda). 1990; 93: 231-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 17Marek L.F. Spalding M.H. Plant Physiol.

Photosynth. Res. 1989; 22: 147-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). PGPase also seems to have an important role in animals by affecting the phosphoglycolate level. In human red blood cells, for example, phosphoglycolate is an effective activator of the bisphosphoglycerate shunt, which is a major modifier of the oxygen affinity of hemoglobin (16Rose Z.B. Grove D.S. Seal S.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 10996-11002Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the regulatory mechanism of PGPase activity in animals is not clear. In this report, we purified PGPase from C. reinhardtii. This is the first homogeneous PGPase purified from a eukaryotic organism. We determined the complete nucleotide sequence of the PGPase cDNA and found characteristics expected to be involved in its regulatory mechanism to help elucidate the physiological importance of PGPase in plants. All purification steps were carried out at 4 °C unless otherwise specified. C. reinhardtii2137 mt+ cells were grown photoautotrophically under ambient air (aerated with air) at 25 °C as described previously (18Suzuki K. Plant Cell Physiol. 1995; 36: 95-100Google Scholar) and collected by centrifugation. The cells were disrupted by sonication in 20 mm MES-KOH buffer, pH 6.3, containing 5 mmMgCl2 and 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride and then centrifuged at 150,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was incubated at 50 °C for 5 min, and the precipitate was removed by centrifugation at 45,000 × g for 20 min. The proteins precipitated between 50–60%-saturated (NH4)2SO4 were collected and dissolved in 2.5 ml of 20 mm MOPS-KOH buffer, pH 6.3, containing 5 mm MgCl2. After being passed through a Sephadex G-25 column (PD-10, Amersham Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden) equilibrated with the same buffer, the fraction was applied to a DEAE-Sephacel column (1 × 7 cm) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with the same buffer. Proteins were eluted by changing the buffer to 20 mm Tris-maleate buffer, pH 6.3, containing 5 mm MgCl2. The fractions with PGPase activity were collected and concentrated to approximately 1 ml using a centrifugal concentrator (Ultrafree-15, Millipore, Bedford, MA) and dialyzed overnight against 1 liter of 20 mm MOPS-KOH buffer, pH 7.1, containing 1 mm MgCl2. Solid potassium chloride and EGTA were then added slowly to attain final concentrations of 1.0 m and 1 mm, respectively. After centrifugation (10,000 × g, 10 min), the supernatant was applied to a phenyl-Sepharose column (1 × 7 cm) (6FF high sub, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with 20 mm MOPS-KOH buffer, pH 7.1, containing 1 mpotassium chloride, 1 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm EGTA at 25 °C. After the column was washed with 25 ml of the same buffer, proteins were eluted with 20 mmMOPS-KOH buffer, pH 7.1, containing 0.8 m KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm EGTA, and the fractions with PGPase activity were collected. After the addition of Tween 20 (final concentration, 0.001%, v/v), the preparation was concentrated to approximately 0.5 ml using Ultrafree-15 and stored at −20 °C until use. The eluate was loaded onto a Q-Sepharose column (1 × 7 cm) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with 20 mm bistrispropane-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 1 mm MgCl2 and eluted with a 75-ml linear gradient of KCl (0–50 mm). Alternatively, the eluate from phenyl-Sepharose was applied to a 5–20% gradient-native PAGE (20Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207002) Google Scholar). PGPase was detected using activity staining (9Belanger F.C. Ogren W.L. Photosynth. Res. 1987; 14: 3-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar) as a white band after the incubation of the gels for 15 min at 25 °C in 20 mmMES-bistrispropane buffer, pH 8.3, containing 5 mmMgCl2, 5 mm CaCl2, and 4 mm phosphoglycolate. The unstained band corresponding to the white band was cut out and homogenized either in 20 mmMOPS-KOH buffer, pH 7.1, containing 5 mm MgCl2to collect the purified PGPase or in Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, containing 1% SDS, 2% mercaptoethanol, and 0.001% bromphenol blue to apply SDS-PAGE using a 12.5% polyacrylamide slab gel (20Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207002) Google Scholar). The separated proteins on SDS-PAGE gel were transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane using a semidry transfer apparatus (TransBlot SD, Bio-Rad) after washing the gel with water for 5 min. After staining the membrane with 0.025% Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 in 40% methanol, the peptide band was excised and subjected to determination of N-terminal amino acid sequence by Edman degradation using an Applied Biosystems Model 477A sequencing system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). DNA were sequenced by using the BigDye Terminator DNA Sequencing Kit and an ABI PRISM 377 DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems). C. reindardtii was transformed with plasmid DNA by electroporation (21Fukuzawa H. Miura K. Ishizaki K. Kucho K. Saito T. Kohinata T. Ohyama K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5347-5352Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) with the slight modification of HS medium being replaced with min-70 medium (4Suzuki K. Mamedov T.G. Ikawa T. Plant Cell Physiol. 1999; 40: 792-799Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Proteins in the crude extract were separated on SDS-PAGE gels and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane as described above. The blots were blocked overnight in a Tris-buffered saline buffer containing 5.5% (w/v) nonfat skim milk, 2% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20, and 0.02% (w/v) sodium azide at 4 °C, washed with Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 and 5.5% nonfat skim milk (BT), and incubated with the primary antibody for 180 min. After being washed four times with BT, the membrane was incubated for 60 min with anti-rabbit IgG biotin conjugate (1:1000 dilution in BT, Sigma). After being washed three times with BT and 1 time with Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20, the membrane was incubated with streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (1:1000 dilution in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20, Life Technologies, Inc.). After being washed five times with Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 and two times with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, the peptides that reacted with the primary antibody were visualized in 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 0.025% 3.3′-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride, 0.03% hydrogen peroxide, and 0.3% CoCl2. A synthetic peptide AS1787, corresponding to the N-terminal 17-amino acid sequence of purified PGPase subunit with cysteine substituted for the N-terminal Ser, was generated by Takara Shuzo Co., Ltd. (Kusatsu, Japan). The antibody against AS1787 was generated and purified by using rProtein A-Sepharose FF (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) coupled with AS1787 by the same company. The PGPase preparation after DEAE-Sephacel was applied to the HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 200-pg column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with 20 mmMOPS-KOH, pH 8.0, 5 mm MgCl2, 100 mm KCl, and 1 mm EDTA at the rate of 1 ml min−1 for the molecular mass determination. Isoelectric focusing analysis of PGPase was carried out in 6.5% (w/v) polyacrylamide gel (22O'Farrell P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 4007-4021Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using Anpholine® preblended pH 3.5–9.5 for isoelectric focusing analysis (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and the isoelectric focusing markers (Isoelectric Focusing Mix 3.6–9.3, Sigma). PGPase was detected by the activity-staining method described above. PGPase activity was determined by measuring the phosphoglycolate-dependent release of inorganic phosphate (23Ames B.N. Methods Enzymol. 1966; 8: 115-118Crossref Scopus (3021) Google Scholar) as described previously using the assay mixture containing 20 mm MES-bistrispropane, pH 8.0, 5 mm MgCl2, and 4 mmphosphoglycolate (18Suzuki K. Plant Cell Physiol. 1995; 36: 95-100Google Scholar). Protein was quantified by the method of Bradford (24Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (215608) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Chlorophyll content was determined after extraction with 96% (v/v) ethanol (25Wintermans J.F.G.M. De Mots A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1965; 109: 448-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (1337) Google Scholar). TableI summarizes the purification steps for PGPase from C. reinhardtii. PGPase eluted from the DEAE-Sephacel column by changing 20 mm MOPS-KOH in the buffer to 20 mm Tris-maleate had a higher specific activity than that of the final preparation reported by Husic and Tolbert (14Husic H.D. Tolbert N.E. Plant Physiol. (Bethesda). 1985; 79: 394-399Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The next step involving phenyl-Sepharose column chromatography was most effective in attaining a specific activity comparable to that from higher plants (Table I), although PGPase was still not the major protein after this step (Fig. 1,lane 1). PGPase activity was stable after the phenyl-Sepharose step for at least 6 months at −20 °C. The single peptide band with a molecular mass of 32 kDa was obtained by SDS-PAGE after the next purification step, either Q-Sepharose column chromatography or native PAGE (Fig. 1). The purified PGPase after Q-Sepharose chromatography had a specific activity of 86.5 μmol Pi (mg protein)−1 min−1, a 1300-fold increase from that of the sonicated cell suspension (TableI).Table IPurification of phosphoglycolate phosphatase from C. reinhardtiiPurification stepTotal proteinTotal activitySpecific activityPurificationRecoverymgunits 1-150One unit, 1 μmol Pi min−1.units mg −1 protein-fold%Sonicated cell suspension409271-160Total activity may be underestimated because of the difficulty of assay with the suspension of sonicated cells.0.0661.0100Crude extract (150,000 × gsupernatant)167270.162.49950 °C for 5 min89.5240.274.28950–60% sat.

Open table in a new tab The molecular mass was estimated to be ∼65 kDa for the native PGPase by Superdex 200 (Fig.2) and ∼32 kDa for the subunit by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1), suggesting PGPase to be a homodimer. The isoelectric point was estimated to be 5.1 (data not shown). TheK m value for phosphoglycolate was ∼140 μm (see Fig. 9). Consistent with the partially purified PGPases from higher plants (9Belanger F.C. Ogren W.L. Photosynth. Res. 1987; 14: 3-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar, 11Hardy P. Baldy P. Planta. 1986; 168: 245-252PubMed Google Scholar), the purified PGPase from C. reinhardtii was also highly specific for phosphoglycolate. After the Q-Sepharose step, the enzyme did not at all hydrolyze 3-phosphoglycerate, d-ribose-5-phosphate, phosphoenolpyruvate, O-phospho-l-serine, orp-nitrophenylphosphate, although it hydrolyzed ribulose-5-phosphate and fructose-1,6-bisphosphate at a rate of 1–4% of that of phosphoglycolate hydrolysis (data not shown).Figure 9Effect of CaCl2 on the double reciprocal plot of PGPase activity versusphosphoglycolate concentration. The activity in the enzyme preparation after phenyl-Sepharose chromatography (0.18 μg of protein) was assayed using our standard method with the exception of phosphoglycolate and CaCl2 concentrations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The N-terminal amino acid sequence of the purified PGPase was determined up to 21 residues, SARPIATNEQKLELLKKVESF. By searching the expressed sequence tag (EST) data base for C. reinhardtii strain C9 (26Asamizu E. Nakamura Y. Sato S. Fukuzawa H. Tabata S. DNA Res. 1999; 6: 369-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), we found an EST encoding the 21-residues amino acid sequence of PGPase with the except that the 20th residue was a cysteine, which was hardly distinguishable from serine by the amino acid sequencer. The complete nucleotide sequence (GenBankTM accession number AB052169) of the EST clone contained an open reading frame encoding a polypeptide consisting of 330 amino acids. The deduced amino acid sequence of the EST clone was similar to that of p-nitrophenylphosphatase (NPPase) in yeast and the relatives in various other organisms (Fig.3). A close similarity was observed especially to an NPPase-like protein in A. thaliana with a 52% identity for the entire sequence (Fig. 3) and 72% for the middle 250 residues. C. reinhardtii PGPase also exhibited a high similarity to the ESTs from various higher plants, such as cotton (GenBankTM accession number AI055133), Lotus japonicus (GenBankTM accession number AV423957), rice (GenBankTM accession number AA751972), soybean (GenBankTM accession number AW755938), tomato (GenBankTM accession number AI777250), pine (GenBankTM accession number AW056729), and wheat (GenBankTM accession number BE425843). On the other hand,C. reinhardtii PGPase was not so similar to prokaryote PGPases with <30% identity to those from Alcaligenes eutrophus (GenBankTM accession number M68904),Aquifex aeolicus (GenBankTM accession numberAE000735), Escherichia coli (GenBankTM accession number AE000414), Synechocystis sp. strain PCC6803 (GenBankTM accession number D90907). However, two sequence motifs, FDXDG and VGD (Fig. 3), were well conserved among PGPases in prokaryotes at the similar positions (data not shown). The first 28 N-terminal amino acid residues, which were not contained in the purified PGPase protein, have the characteristics of a transit peptide of C. reinhardtii. The amino acid sequence was rich in Arg and Ala and contained no acidic residue. Four Arg residues spaced by two or three neutral amino acids in the middle region were just within the random coil region between two amphiphilic helical motifs consisting of five or six residues (Fig.4). The amino acid sequence just upstream of the N-terminal of the purified enzyme, VAAQA, was similar to the motif VXA (27Franzén L.-G. Rochaix J.-D. Heijne G.V. FEBS Lett. 1990; 260: 165-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). These characteristics are consistent with the typical features of a stroma transit peptide (27Franzén L.-G. Rochaix J.-D. Heijne G.V. FEBS Lett. 1990; 260: 165-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 28Krimm I. Gans P. Hernadez J.-F. Arlaud G.J. Lancelin J.-M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 265: 171-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), indicating that PGPase in C. reinhardtii is a stroma protein (14Husic H.D. Tolbert N.E. Plant Physiol. (Bethesda). 1985; 79: 394-399Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as reported in higher plants (11Hardy P. Baldy P. Planta. 1986; 168: 245-252PubMed Google Scholar). The predicted molecular mass and isoelectric point of the mature subunit of 302 amino acids were approximately 33kDa and 5.6, respectively, consistent with those determined for the purified PGPase as described above. Although 425 proteins containing the motif FDXDG were found in the Swiss-Prot data base at the ExPASy site (www.expasy.org), they were mainly Ca2+-binding or phosphate-related proteins. The amino acid sequence of the PGPase contained two regions similar to EF-hand motifs of Ca2+-binding proteins such as C. reinhardtiicalmodulin (Fig. 4), although three residues did not match in both regions to the consensus pattern of EF-hand: DX-[DNS]-{ILVFYW}-[DENSTG]-[DNQGHRK]-{GP}- [LIVMC]-[DENQSTAGC]-X 2-[DE]-[LIVMFYW]. The affinity-purified antibody raised against a synthetic peptide AS1787 (see under “Experimental Procedures”) reacted strongly with the subunit of purified PGPase in the immunoblot analysis (Fig.5, lane 6). Several other bands were also detected by the antibody in crude extract of wild-type 2137 (lanes 8-10), but they were also detected by the preimmune serum (lanes 3–5). The 32-kDa peptide corresponding to the PGPase subunit seems to be the only band detected specifically by the antibody and was not detected in a PGPase-deficient mutant pgp1-18–7F, in which the activity to hydrolyzep-glycolate was marginal (3Suzuki K. Marek L.F. Spalding M.H. Plant Physiol. (Bethesda). 1990; 93: 231-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 17Marek L.F. Spalding M.H. Plant Physiol. (Bethesda). 1991; 97: 420-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 18Suzuki K. Plant Cell Physiol. 1995; 36: 95-100Google Scholar) and was not caused by the PGPase with the optimal pH of approximately 8 (18Suzuki K. Plant Cell Physiol. 1995; 36: 95-100Google Scholar). These findings suggest that the PGPase we purified is the PGPase essential for growth under ambient air from which activity is missing in the mutant. It was also reported that PGPase activity in 2137 increased by ∼60% 5 h after transfer 5% CO2-grown cells to air (17Marek L.F. Spalding M.H. Plant Physiol. (Bethesda). 1991; 97: 420-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). However, not so much difference was observed between the immunoblot profiles of 5% CO2-grown and 5-h air-adapting cells of 2137, although PGPase activity increased by ∼50% (Fig. 5). Four clones in a genomic DNA library of C. reinhardtii C9 (21Fukuzawa H. Miura K. Ishizaki K. Kucho K. Saito T. Kohinata T. Ohyama K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5347-5352Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) showed strong signals in two separate Southern blotting experiments probed with independent digoxigenin-labeled polymerase chain reaction products of the genomic DNA from a wild-type 2137 by using primers designed based on the cDNA sequence of PGP1 (data not shown). The DNA fragments from these clones were used for the transformation (21Fukuzawa H. Miura K. Ishizaki K. Kucho K. Saito T. Kohinata T. Ohyama K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5347-5352Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) of N142, a wall-less progeny of the pgp1 mutant after crossing 18-7F withcw15 strains. The genomic clones 57B9 and 60C10 successfully restored the growth of the pgp1 mutant under air. In a transformant with 57B9, the growth rate under air was approximately 40% of that of wild type, and PGPase activity was approximately 25% of that of wild type. These results support that the high CO2-requiring phenotype of pgp1 is caused by the deficiency in PGPase activity, and that the sequenced cDNA represents a physiologically functional PGPase. We observed an increase in mRNA level of PGPase 5 h after transferring the wild-type cells from 5% CO2 to air (Fig.6). Although there was not so much increase in the peptide level of PGPase (Fig. 5), the increase in the activity of PGPase 5 h after transfer to air is probably expected to be a result of a posttranscriptional regulation. Husic and Tolbert (14Husic H.D. Tolbert N.E. Plant Physiol. (Bethesda). 1985; 79: 394-399Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) reported a broad pH optimum with the maximal activity approximately pH 6.3 for partially purified PGPase from C. reinhardtii. However, this profile was uncertain, because they used a very complicated buffer system using 20 mm acetate, ∼pH 6.3. We observed a 50% inhibition of PGPase activity by 20 mm acetate (data not shown). We determined the pH profile using 20 mm3,3-dimethylglutarate-KOH as the buffer for acidic pH and 20 mm MES-bistrispropane for basic pH (Fig.7). The optimal pH was between 8 and 9, and the activity at pH 6.3 was less than half that at pH 8 in the enzyme purified with DEAE-Sephacel, which was quite similar to that reported in H. cylindracea (13Randall D.D. Aust. J. Plant Physiol. 1976; 3: 105-111Google Scholar), although the activity was relatively higher between pH 5 and 7 in the crude extract (Fig. 7). It was reported that PGPase from maize was inhibited very strongly by Ca2+, and this was reversed by Mg2+ (11Hardy P. Baldy P. Planta. 1986; 168: 245-252PubMed Google Scholar). We also observed the reversible inhibition in the purified PGPase from C. reinhardtii (data not shown). The inhibition increased with decreasing concentration of Mg2+ in the reaction mixture (Fig.8), and the IC50 value for CaCl2 was ∼50 and 175 μm with 0.5 and 1 mm MgCl2, respectively (data not shown). The addition of 5 mm EGTA also resulted in 100% recovery after inhibition by CaCl2, whereas EGTA did not affect the activity of PGPase in the absence of CaCl2 (TableII) even after preincubation with 5 mm EGTA (data not shown). Fig.9 compares the double reciprocal plots of PGPase activity at different concentrations of CaCl2. The affinity for phosphoglycolate was not affected by Ca2+, indicating it to be a non-competitive inhibition with respect to its substrate. The subunit of PGPase pretreated with Ca2+migrated faster in SDS-PAGE than PGPase pretreated only with EGTA (Fig.10), which is characteristic of Ca2+-binding proteins (29Roberts D.M. Harmon A.C.

Biophys. 1984; 229: 64-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). However, unlike in spinach, ribose-5-phospate did not inhibit but rather activated C. reinhardtii PGPase (Fig.11). Table II shows the effect of some other compounds on the activity of purified PGPase from C. reinhardtii. The activity was strongly inhibited by PMB with an IC50 of 0.45 μm, although only a slow inhibition by N-ethylmaleimide was reported in tobacco PGPase (30Christeller J.T. Tolbert N.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 1791-1798Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The activity recovered ∼90% following the addition of 10 mm DTT, whereas 10 mm DTT did not affect the activity without PMB treatment even after 2-h treatment at 30 °C. These results suggest that at least one of the SH groups of four Cys residues (Fig. 3) has a potential to modulate the activity. Treatment with 10 mm DTT at 30 °C for 2 h did not change the mobility of PGPase in the native PAGE (data not shown). Mobility was not changed in SDS-PAGE either with or without 2-mercaptoethanol (data not shown). These results indicate that there is no S–S bond between the subunits. Activity was inhibited by O-phenanthroline, a metal complex reagent, but the IC50 value of 1 mm was higher than in ordinary metaloenzymes. PGPase activity was not sensitive to sodium azide, suggesting that the enzyme does not contain heme. PGPase is essential for all autotrophic organisms and is also important for the function of human red blood cells (16Rose Z.B. Grove D.S. Seal S.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 10996-11002Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, there is little information about its regulation and no information about the molecular structure of eukaryotic PGPases. Here we present the first report on the purification of a eukaryotic PGPase with high enough purity to enable the determination of its N-terminal amino acid sequence of up to 21 residues, which allowed us to determine the complete nucleotide sequence of cDNA. We concluded that PGPase from C. reinhardtii is a homodimer with a molecular mass of ∼65 kDa consisting of two identical 32-kDa subunits whose molecular masses were predicted to be 33 kDa from the cDNA sequence. Eukaryotic PGPases were reported to be homodimers with almost the same native molecular mass among a wide variety of organisms, such as maize (11Hardy P. Baldy P. Planta. 1986; 168: 245-252PubMed Google Scholar), tobacco (9Belanger F.C. Ogren W.L. Photosynth. Res. 1987; 14: 3-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar), spinach (31Seal S.N. Rose Z.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 13496-13500Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and human (15Zecher R. Schwuléra U. Wolf H.U. Int. J. Biochem. 1982; 14: 775-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Earlier reports proposed a much higher molecular mass of PGPases from plants and algae, 92 kDa as the native molecular mass for the partially purified enzyme from C. reinhardtii (14Husic H.D. Tolbert N.E. Plant Physiol. (Bethesda). 1985; 79: 394-399Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), 93 kDa for spinach, and 81–86 kDa (tetramer) for tobacco (30Christeller J.T. Tolbert N.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 1791-1798Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, such values were shown to be quite unlikely, at least in spinach and tobacco (9Belanger F.C. Ogren W.L. Photosynth. Res. 1987; 14: 3-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar), and the inconsistency may be partly a consequence of the insufficient purity in those PGPase preparations. The pI value of 5.1 for the purified PGPase from C. reinhardtii was consistent with those reported among a wide variety of organisms, 4.9 for PGPase from maize leaves (11Hardy P. Baldy P. Planta. 1986; 168: 245-252PubMed Google Scholar), 4.4 for PGPase from pea (12Kerr M.W. Gear C.F. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1974; 2: 338-340Crossref Google Scholar), 4.2 and 5.5 for two isoforms from french bean (32Verin-Vergeau C. Baldy P. Cavalie G. Phytochemistry. 1979; 18: 1279-1282Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar), and 5.0 for PGPase from human red blood cells (15Zecher R. Schwuléra U. Wolf H.U. Int. J. Biochem. 1982; 14: 775-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the reported kinetic characteristics of PGPase vary widely among the different species. TheK m value for phosphoglycolate was reported to be 26 μm in spinach (10Husic H.D. Tolbert N.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1984; 229: 64-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and tobacco (30Christeller J.T. Tolbert N.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 1791-1798Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), 222 μmin the cyanobacteria C. peniocystis (7Norman E.G. Colman B. Plant Physiol. (Bethesda). 1991; 95: 693-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), 570 μm in maize (11Hardy P. Baldy P. Planta. 1986; 168: 245-252PubMed Google Scholar), and 800 μm in the brown algae H. cylindracea (13Randall D.D. Aust. J. Plant Physiol. 1976; 3: 105-111Google Scholar). Much larger values of 2 mm have been reported in pea (12Kerr M.W. Gear C.F. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1974; 2: 338-340Crossref Google Scholar) and bean (32Verin-Vergeau C. Baldy P. Cavalie G. Phytochemistry. 1979; 18: 1279-1282Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar). TheK m value of 140 μm determined forC. reinhardtii in our study was similar to that of C. peniocystis, intermediate to that of spinach and maize, although the value of 23 μm reported earlier for C. reinhardtii (14Husic H.D. Tolbert N.E. Plant Physiol. (Bethesda). 1985; 79: 394-399Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was as small as that in spinach and tobacco. Such diversity may be a result of some differences in experimental conditions, because the values can be affected by the concentrations of inorganic phosphate, ribose-5-phosphate, and MgCl2 (8Christeller J.T. Tolbert N.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 1780-1785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Rose Z.B. Grove D.S. Seal S.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 10996-11002Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,33Christeller J.T. Tolbert N.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 1786-1790Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Ca2+ may have an important role in the regulation of PGPase activity in vivo. Our results indicated that C. reinhardtii PGPase was a Ca2+-binding protein and was strongly but reversibly inhibited by Ca2+, although the effective concentration appeared higher than that usually observed in cells. It is very probable that at least the first EF-hand-like region in C. reinhardtii PGPase (Fig. 4) is responsible for Ca2+ binding. The region was more similar than the second one to the EF-hand motif and was observed at almost the same position from the N-terminal to that of the first EF-hand of calmodulins. However, the main role of this region is more likely to bind Mg2+, because Ca2+ was a competitive inhibitor with respect to Mg2+. Although PGPase requires a divalent cation such as Mg2+ and a monovalent anion such as Cl− for activity, the enzyme is probably saturated with these activators in vivo (7Norman E.G. Colman B. Plant Physiol. (Bethesda). 1991; 95: 693-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). However, it is still possible that the activity is regulated by the Mg2+/Ca2+ratio. On the other hand, it was proposed that maize PGPase was regulated by light through both energy charge and NADP(H) via a regulatory site(s) without modification of the protein by the ferredoxin-thioredoxin system (19Baldy P. Jacquot J.-P. Lavergne D. Champigny M.L. Photosynth. Res. 1989; 22: 147-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). C. reinhardtii PGPase may also be regulated in a similar way, as we did not detect any effect of DTT on the activity in the absence of the SH-reagent. It is still possible, however, that PGPase activity is regulated by the modification of Cys residues. The addition of DTT resulted in the recover of the activity after complete inactivation by PMB, and the two most N-terminal Cys were arranged as a CXXXXC motif, which is also observed in some thioredoxin-targeted stroma enzymes as the regulatory site (34Schürmann P. Jacquot J.-P. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 2000; 51: 371-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). The corresponding CXXXXC motif was not found among other NPPase-like gene products (Fig. 3), although Cys corresponding to the C-terminal end of the motif was conserved well. It should also be pointed out that two other stroma phosphatases, fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase, and sedoheptulose-1,7-bisphosphatase are thioredoxin-targeted enzymes with the CXXXXC motif (34Schürmann P. Jacquot J.-P. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 2000; 51: 371-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar) and are also known to be inhibited by Ca2+ (35Charles S.A. Halliwell B. Biochem. J. 1980; 188: 775-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 36Hertig C. Wolosiuk R.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1980; 97: 325-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 37Wolosiuk R.A. Hertig C.M. Busconi L. FEBS Lett. 1982; 140: 31-35Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar). It is still unclear how PGPase activity increases by 50–60% within 5 h when 5% CO2-grown cells were transferred to air. The activity does not seem to be regulated by the change in the amount of enzyme (Fig. 6). PGPase activity may be regulated during the adaptation by the change in one or some of the possible metabolites, such as phosphoglycolate, ribose 5-phosphate, and inorganic phosphate (30Christeller J.T. Tolbert N.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 1791-1798Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and/or the change(s) in Mg2+/Ca2+ ratio, energy charge, pH, NADP(H), thioredoxins, or glutathione in the stroma. Deduced amino acid sequence of C. reinhardtii PGPase exhibited significant homology to NPPase-like gene products in yeast and animals. Together with close similarities in molecular properties, such as the molecular mass, pI value, and the homodimeric composition discussed above, this finding suggests that some of the NPPase-like gene products in these organisms are also PGPases, althouth dj37E16.5 (Fig. 3) may not be a human PGPase, because the gene is located in chromosome 22. Instead, we found the sequence more similar to that of C. reinhardtii PGPase in a working draft sequence (GenBankTM accession number AC012171) from chromosome 16 in which the human PGPase gene is located (38Mulley J.C. Barton N. Callen D.F. Cytogenet. Cell Genet. 1990; 53: 175-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The NPPase-like gene product from A. thaliana is probably PGPase rather than NPPase based on the close similarity in the deduced amino acid sequence to that of C. reinhardtii PGPase. Similarly, ESTs from several other plant species are also good candidates for the genes encoding PGPase. These results suggest that eukaryotic PGPases in various organisms ranging from animals to plants share a common ancestral molecule as proposed by Rose et al. (16Rose Z.B. Grove D.S. Seal S.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 10996-11002Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although they were not similar to prokaryotic PGPases in both structure and function, our knowledge on PGPases only came from quite a limited number of organisms. Thus, a more extensive comparison is necessary on the structure and function of PGPases in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes to dissolve this missing link. In this study, it was also shown that the PGPase protein we purified is missing in the PGPase-deficient mutant pgp1-18–7F, whereas the nuclear recessive mutation in this mutant is still not clear in the molecular level (3Suzuki K. Marek L.F. Spalding M.H. Plant Physiol. (Bethesda). 1990; 93: 231-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 17Marek L.F. Spalding M.H. Plant Physiol. (Bethesda). 1991; 97: 420-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 18Suzuki K. Plant Cell Physiol. 1995; 36: 95-100Google Scholar). Further studies are in progress for this mutant. We thank Mrs. Hiroko Kondo, Dr. Koji Iwamoto, and Dr. Yoshihiro Shiraiwa in University of Tsukuba for help and suggestions to analyze N-terminal amino acid sequence of PGPase and Dr. Mark Lieffering in National Agricultural Research Center for a critical reading of the manuscript."

Although the LHCII has been extensively studied since its discovery more than 35 years ago, there are still several questions about the number of polypeptides it contains and its supramolecular organization. It is known that LHCII apoproteins are encoded by families of nuclear genes (1Dunsmuir P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 2503-2516Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 2Green B.R. Griffiths W. Pichersky E. Kloppstech K. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 181-186Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 3Jansson S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1184: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar) and over 40 nucleotide sequences encoding LHCII proteins from more than 15 different plant species have been cloned and sequenced (4Jansson S. Pichersky E. Bassi R. Green B.R. Ikeuchi M. Melis A. Simpson D.J. Spangfort M. Staehelin L.A. Thornber J.P. Plant Mol. Biol. Rep. 1992; 10: 242-253Crossref Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Moreover, a large number of protein bands can be resolved by gel electrophoresis from LHCII preparations (3Jansson S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1184: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). The precise relationship between the multiple functional roles played by LHCII, the diversity of polypeptides found in the membrane, and the complexity of the gene family that encodes the LHCII apoproteins has not yet been fully established. The observed protein heterogeneity has, in fact, a number of possible origins, thus the different protein isoforms could be: (i) products of distinct genes (5Jansson S. Selstam E. Gustafsson P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 10: 110-114Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar), (ii) post-translational modifications of one or a few primary translation products (6Bennett J. Steinback K.E. Arntzen C.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 5253-5257Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 7Bergantino E. Dainese P. Cerovic Z. Sechi S. Bassi R. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 2641-2648Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), or (iv) artifacts introduced during sample workup and analysis. The antenna system is organized into a mobile complex containing homotrimers of Lhcb1 and heterotrimers combining Lhcb1 and Lhcb2 (10Larsson U.K. Anderson J.M. Andersson B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 894: 69-75Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and an immobile complex containing trimers of Lhcb1 and Lhcb3 probably in a 2:1 ratio associated with the minor antenna proteins, which altogether surround the core complex. In most of the models proposed for the architecture of the light-harvesting complex, the minor antenna proteins form a link between the PSII core proteins and the major antenna proteins that are located in the periphery of PSII (11Bassi R. Dainese P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 204: 317-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Regarding the mobile complex, it has been recently reported that more than one trimeric form of LHCII may exist and that these are organized into different supramolecular complexes with differing aggregation tendency to PSII (“S,” “M,” and “L” types, referring to strongly, moderately, and loosely bound LHCII, respectively) (12Boekema E.J. van Roon H. van Breemen J.F.L. Dekker J.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 266: 444-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Specifically, the Lhcb1 proteins occur in several isoforms, but the functional significance of the diversity of the Lhcb1 apoproteins is still unknown. In particular, little attention has been devoted so far to the role of the subtypes of Lhcb1. It is also not clear whether different major antenna proteins assemble into homo- or heterotrimers and whether they serve different functions within the thylakoid membrane. The organizational differences observed in PSII can alter the efficiency of light-energy transfer from the major light-harvesting complexes to the photochemical reaction center and thus provide the system with a means to regulate photosynthetic efficiency under the various light or stress conditions to which green plants have to adapt (13Dekker P.J. van Roon H. Boekema E.J. FEBS Lett. 1999; 449: 211-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 14Zolla L. Rinalducci S. Timperio A.M. Pandalay S.G. Recent Reseach Developments in Bioenergetics. Transworld Research Network, Trivandrum, India2000Google Scholar). The emerging picture of the molecular organization and regulation of the photosynthetic apparatus presents one of the most interesting and challenging areas of modern plant biochemistry. However, it is becoming increasingly clear that the protein composition of the PSII antenna is complex and that there are several polypeptides with small differences in molecular mass and sequence that have to be unambiguously characterized in order to understand their function within the PSII. Various analytical techniques, including SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE), SDS-isoelectric focusing, high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) (15Sharma J. Panico M. Barber J. Morris H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33153-33157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 16Sharma J. Panico M. Barber J. Morris H.M. J. Biol.

Giacometti G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13784-13790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), are applicable to the characterization of minute differences in heterogeneous proteins. Traditionally, the protein components of the PS II major and minor antenna system are resolved by SDS-PAGE into several closely migrating protein bands (19Bassi R. Hoyer-Hansen G. Barbato R. Giacometti G.M. Simpson D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 13333-13341Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Peter G.F. Thornber J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16745-16754Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, reversed-phase HPLC (RP-HPLC) has been successfully applied to the fractionation of the various types of antenna proteins (21Zolla L. Timperio A.M. Testi M.G. Bianchetti M. Bassi R. Manera F. Corradini D. Photosynth. Res. 1999; 61: 281-290Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Although single stage chromatographic separation systems offer high resolving power, the separation selectivity may not suffice to separate all protein isoforms having very subtle structural differences (22Opiteck G.J. Lewis K.C. Jorgenson J.W. Anderegg R.J. Anal. Chem. 1997; 69: 1518-1524Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). A practical means of increasing the selectivity of an analytical system is the use of two or more separation stages, resulting in a multidimensional separation (23Cortes H.J. J. Chromatogr. 1992; 626: 3-23Crossref Scopus (75) Google Scholar). While MS is generally viewed as a spectroscopic technique yielding the molecular mass as well as structural information, it can also be viewed as a separation technique distinguishing between different mass-to-charge ratios. Consequently, conjugation of HPLC and MS represents a multidimensional separation system offering the high selectivity indispensable to distinguish closely related proteins. In the past decade, the advent of ESI and MALDI as soft ionization methods for biological macromolecules has greatly enhanced the role of protein MS in structural biochemistry (24Li J. Assmann S.M. Plant Physiol. 2000; 123: 807-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 25Hancock W. Apffel A. Chakel J. Hahnenberger K. Choudhary G. Anal. Chem. 1999; 1 (. A-748A): 742Crossref Google Scholar, 26Griffiths, W. J. (2000) EXS (Basel) 8869-8879Google Scholar) and in proteomic studies (27Peltier J.B. Friso G. Kalume D.E. Roepstorff P. Nilsson F. Adamska I. van Wijlk K.J. Plant Cell Physiol. 2000; 12: 319-341Google Scholar). By virtue of its high resolving power and the utilization of eluents that are compatible with ESI-MS (28Huber C.G. Premstaller A. J. Chromatogr. A. 1999; 849: 161-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), RP-HPLC has become the separation method of choice for direct interfacing with ESI-MS (29Zolla L. Timperio A.M. Proteins. 2000; 41: 398-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar,30Premstaller A. Oberacher H. Walcher W. Timperio A.-M. Zolla L. Chervet J.-P. Cavusoglu N. Van Dorsellaer A. Huber C.G. Anal. Chem. 2001; 73: 2390-2396Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). In this article, the strategy of RP-HPLC-ESI-MS has been used to separate and identify isomeric forms of major and minor antenna proteins in different plant species. The high reproducibility and short analysis times of the hyphenated system enabled a comparison of the antenna proteome from 14 different dicot and monocot species. This information was utilized to generalize differences in the antenna proteome between monocots and dicots and their influence on the supramolecular organization of the PSII antenna system. Reagent-grade phosphoric acid, magnesium chloride, sodium chloride, silver nitrate, sodium carbonate, trifluoroacetic acid, methanol, ethanol, formamide, HPLC-grade water, and acetonitrile were obtained from Carlo Erba (Milan, Italy). Sucrose, Tricine, Tris, N-octyl β-d-glucopyranoside, N-dodecyl β-d-maltoside, chlorophyll a and chlorophyllb, and MES were obtained from Sigma. Triton X-100 andN-octylsucrose were purchased from Calbiochem. Chloroplast thylakoid membranes (PSII membranes) were isolated from the following dicot and monocot leaves: spinach (Spinacia oleracea), petunia (Petunia hybrida), pea (Pisum sativum), tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum), tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum), cucumber (Cucumis sativus), soybean (Glicine max), Vicia faba, Populus albae, maize (Zea mays), rice (Oryza sativa), barley (Hordeum vulgare), rye (Secale cereale), and wheat (Triticum aestivum) according to the method of Berthold et al. (31Berthold D.A. Babcock G.T. Yocum C.F. FEBS Lett. 1981; 134: 231-234Crossref Scopus (1640) Google Scholar) with the modifications reported elsewhere (21Zolla L. Timperio A.M. Testi M.G. Bianchetti M. Bassi R. Manera F. Corradini D. Photosynth. Res. 1999; 61: 281-290Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The light-harvesting complex was isolated from the PSII membranes as described previously (11Bassi R. Dainese P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 204: 317-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. PSII membranes were pelleted by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 5.0 min at 4 °C, suspended in Buffer 1 (50 mm MES, pH 6.3, 15 mm sodium chloride, 5 mm magnesium chloride) containing 1.0 mg/mg chlorophyll, and then solubilized by adding 1% (w/v)N-dodecyl β-d-maltoside. Unsolubilized material was removed by centrifugation at 10,000 × gfor 10 min. The supernatant was rapidly loaded onto a 0.1–1.0m sucrose gradient containing Buffer 1 and 5.0 mm N-dodecyl β-d-maltoside. The gradient was then spun on a Kontron Model Centricon T-1080 ultracentrifuge equipped with a Model TST 41.14 rotor at 39,000 rpm for 18 h at 4 °C. Green bands were harvested with a syringe. The SDS-PAGE analysis of these green bands revealed that band 2 contained a mixture of the protein components of the major and minor PSII antenna systems, whereas band 3 essentially contained the protein components of the major PSII antenna system as reported previously (11Bassi R. Dainese P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 204: 317-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). These bands were used for HPLC analysis without any further treatment. The RP-HPLC-ESI-MS experiments were carried out with a Model Rheos 2000 low pressure gradient pump (Flux Instruments, Basel, Switzerland), a degasser (ERC 3215, Ercatech, Bern, Switzerland), a Rheodyne Model 7125 injector equipped with a 100-μl sample loop, and a Finnigan MAT TSQ 7000 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (Finnigan MAT, San Jose, CA). Details of instrumental setup and tuning are given in Ref. 32Corradini D. Huber C.G. Timperio A.-M. Zolla L. J. Chromatogr. A. 2000; 886: 111-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar. The analyses were performed using Vydac (The Separation Group, Hesperia, CA) Protein C-4 columns of either 250 × 4.6 mm or 250 × 10 mm inner diameter, both containing 5-μm porous butyl silica. Antenna proteins were eluted with linear gradients of acetonitrile in 0.05% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid at ambient temperature. Gradient profiles and flow rates are given in the figure legends. In each species examined, PSII was isolated from thylakoid membranes of leaves by Triton X-100 extraction. Then the PSII complex was extracted as described in Ref. 31Berthold D.A. Babcock G.T. Yocum C.F. FEBS Lett. 1981; 134: 231-234Crossref Scopus (1640) Google Scholar and subjected to sucrose-gradient ultracentrifugation. Fig.1 illustrates an example of the band patterns obtained upon sucrose-gradient ultracentrifugation from the monocot species maize (left tube) and the dicot species spinach (right tube). The fractionated protein components were the monomeric antenna system (in band 2) and the trimeric major antenna system (in band 3). It can be seen clearly that after loading the same amount of protein, the intensity of band 2 in the dicot species is significantly lower than in the monocot species, indicating that in dicots most of the light-harvesting proteins are organized in trimers. Additional sucrose gradients from different species revealed that in all nine dicot species studied band 2 was less intense than band 3, whereas in all four monocot species examined the two bands were of similar intensity (Fig. 1). Spectrophotometric determination of chlorophyll in each sucrose band revealed that in monocots the intensity of band 2 is about 40% less than in band 2 collected from dicots. This result suggests that the monomeric and trimeric forms are present to a similar extent in monocots, whereas the trimeric form is more prevalent in dicots. Although in a former investigation the chromatographic and mass spectrometric conditions were optimized to analyze exclusively the antenna proteins of spinach (32Corradini D. Huber C.G. Timperio A.-M. Zolla L. J. Chromatogr. A. 2000; 886: 111-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), conditions in this study were chosen to be generally applicable to the characterization of the antenna proteins in a large variety of plant species. Thus, a gradient of 39–69% acetonitrile in 0.05% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid in 45 min was utilized to elute the protein components from a 250 × 4.6 mm inner diameter C4-silica column. This not only facilitated the separation of all different types of major and minor antenna proteins in the different species but also the efficient removal of detergents from the sample, which were needed to solubilize the hydrophobic membrane proteins during sample preparation but which are known to efficiently inhibit ion formation in ESI-MS. The components of band 3 from sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation, containing only the trimeric major antenna proteins, as well as those of band 2, containing both monomeric major and minor antenna proteins, were analyzed separately. However, under the chromatographic conditions, the trimers from band 3 dissociated into the monomeric apoproteins, yielding the same molecular masses as those observed for the equivalent apoproteins present in band 2. Fig. 2 a illustrates the reconstructed ion chromatogram of antenna proteins upon injection of band 2 from petunia. A total of 15 protein masses were extracted from the chromatogram; these proteins are related to the six types of PSII light-harvesting proteins and were identified by comparison with the molecular masses deduced from the DNA sequences. From the number of found proteins, it is evident that at least some of them must be present in different isoforms. Fig. 2, b–e, reports the deconvoluted mass spectra of Lhcb1, Lhcb6, and Lhcb3 for which six, four, and two isoforms, respectively, were identified. Some of the isoforms were separable by RP-HPLC because of their differing hydrophobicity (e.g. Lhcb1.1 from Lhcb1.2 or Lhcb6.1 from Lhcb6.2/6.3/6.4), whereas some others coeluted in one HPLC peak but were distinguished by ESI-MS analysis (e.g. Lhcb1.3/1.4/1.5 or Lhcb6.216.316.4). For three of the antenna proteins, namely Lhcb2, Lhcb4, and Lhcb5, only one protein was found. A similar picture was observed for the major and minor antenna proteins of tomato in which Lhcb1 occurred in five isoforms, Lhcb3 occurred in two isoforms, and Lhcb6 occurred in two isoforms, respectively (Fig.3, a–e), whereas Lhcb2, Lhcb4, and Lhcb5 revealed only one molecular mass each. Finally, Fig. 4 reports the reconstructed ion chromatogram of antenna proteins from rice. In this monocot species, the number of isomeric proteins was significantly lower, showing only two isoforms for Lhcb1 and two for Lhcb6 (Fig. 4, b andc).Figure 3Analysis of antenna protein isoforms in tomato using RP-HPLC-ESI-MS.

In the table, the sum represents the total number of isoforms observed for the antenna proteins, whereas the individual numbers indicate the number of proteins coeluting in one HPLC peak that were, however, distinguishable by ESI-MS. From Table Iit becomes evident that the diversity of Lhcb1, Lhcb3, and Lhcb6 is significantly more pronounced in dicots as compared with monocots. Moreover, a higher number of isoforms is observed generally in species in which a higher number of genes have also been cloned. In all species examined, the other antenna proteins (Lhcb2, Lhcb4, and Lhcb5) were present in only one copy. Another aspect of the data presented in TableI is the presence of two separable HPLC peaks for Lhcb1 in nine of the 14 species examined. Only two of the species showed one peak, and three species showed more than two distinct HPLC peaks for Lhcb1.Table IIsoforms of antenna proteins revealed by RP-HPLC-ESI-MSSpeciesLhcb1Lhcb3Lhcb6No. of isoforms1-aThe sum equals the total number of isoforms observed for the antenna proteins; individual numbers indicate the number of proteins coeluting in one HPLC peak that were, however, distinguishable by ESI-MS.

Open table in a new tab To collect more information on the isomeric proteins observed, Fig. 5compares the hydropathic profiles for the Lhcb1 antenna proteins determined from the DNA sequence using the Kyte-Doolittle method (33Kyte J. Doolittle R.F.J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref Scopus (16890) Google Scholar). In Fig. 5 a, the hydropathic profiles of Lhcb1 in pea, spinach, and tomato are compared. Fig. 5, b andc, illustrates the profiles of two different gene products within the same species, giving one example for the dicot tomato (Fig.5 b) as well as one for the monocot maize (Fig. 5c). It was generally observed that the Lhcb1 hydropathic profiles show significant differences only in the amino-terminal region, which explains the diverse retention times among different species and within the same species. The dissimilarities in the transmembrane- and carboxyl-terminal region are only very subtle as a consequence of the highly conserved protein sequence both within and among species. Calculation of the retention coefficients for isomeric proteins in various species according to Browne et al. (34Browne C.A. Bennet H.P. Solomon S. Anal. Biochem. 1982; 124: 201-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar) revealed that there are two distinct groups of proteins both in dicots and monocots (Table II): one population with retention coefficients higher than 900 and another with retention coefficients lower than 900. These differences in the hydrophobicity are confirmed by the aliphatic indices (35Ikai A. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1980; 88: 1895-1998PubMed Google Scholar) (Table II) and most probably explain the fractionation of isoforms into two major HPLC peaks (Figs. 2 and 3 and Table I). The two groups of Lhcb1 proteins display differences in the amino-terminal region, which give two main peaks with different elution times within the same species. Thus, it is likely that at least two subpopulations of Lhcb1 antenna proteins exist with significant differences in amino acid composition resulting in separability by RP-HPLC.Table IITFA retention coefficients and aliphatic indices calculated for Lhcb1 proteins on the basis of their nucleotide-derived amino acid sequencesSpeciesGene Name2-aGene names according to the nomenclature reported by Jansson et al.

Open table in a new tab The presence of multigene families is common in the vegetable kingdom, in which a crucial task for the future will be to understand the biological significance of the numerous gene families with tandem gene arrangement. In particular, the antennae of photosystem I and II are encoded by several genes that show a high homology and consequently should encode proteins with similar molecular masses and molecular properties. Because of almost identical electrophoretic mobilities, such closely related proteins are difficult to separate and identify by conventional SDS-PAGE. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, currently the most powerful method for the separation of a large number of proteins, is not applicable for these hydrophobic membrane proteins because of their very similar isoelectric points and the necessity for them to be kept in solution by suitable detergents. Here we show for the first time that a multidimensional approach using RP-HPLC on-line coupled to ESI-MS is suitable to characterize even the isomeric forms of the antenna proteins of PSII in a single chromatographic run. In fact, several isomers of Lhcb1, Lhcb3, and Lhcb6 have been revealed in a variety of plants without the need for special experimental procedures such as the use of polyclonal and monospecific antibodies (36Sigrist M. Staehelin L.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1098: 191-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), dedicated electrolyte solutions, and/or extended length gels for SDS-PAGE (37Dainese P.

https://openalex.org/W2136998066,"Although DNA replication has been thought to play an important role in the silencing of mating type loci inSaccharomyces cerevisiae, recent studies indicate that silencing can be decoupled from replication. InSchizosaccharomyces pombe, mating type silencing is brought about by the trans-acting proteins, namely Swi6, Clr1-Clr4, and Rhp6, in cooperation with the cis-acting silencers. The latter contain an autonomous replication sequence, suggesting that DNA replication may be critical for silencing in S. pombe. To investigate the connection between DNA replication and silencing inS. pombe, we analyzed several temperature-sensitive mutants of DNA polymerase α. We find that one such mutant,swi7H4, exhibits silencing defects at mat, centromere, and telomere loci. This effect is independent of the checkpoint and replication defects of the mutant. Interestingly, the extent of the silencing defect in the swi7H4 mutant at the silent mat2 locus is further enhanced in absence of the cis-acting, centromere-proximal silencer. The chromodomain protein Swi6, which is required for silencing and is localized tomat and other heterochromatin loci, interacts with DNA polymerase α in vivo and in vitro in wild type cells. However, it does not interact with the mutant polα and is delocalized away from the silent mat loci in the mutant. Our results demonstrate a role of DNA polymerase α in the establishment of silencing. We propose a recruitment model for the coupling of DNA replication with the establishment of silencing by the chromodomain protein Swi6, which may be applicable to higher eukaryotes.

Although the mating type phenotype of a homothallic strain is dictated by the MAT locus depending on whether it harbors the a- orα-specific alleles, two copies of the same genetic information are located at distant sites on the same chromosome, namelyHML and HMR, which harbor α anda alleles, respectively. However, these alleles are transcriptionally silent. The silencing is achieved by the cis-acting sequences E (essential) and I (important) that flank bothHML and HMR loci (1Klar A.J.S.

In addition, several genes encode factors named mating type regulator/silent information regulator (MAR/SIR) that function in trans through the cis-acting sequences in keeping the HML and HMR loci silent. Extensive studies in S. cerevisiae have suggested that DNA replication is important for repression of the silent mating type lociHML and HMR (see Refs. 1Klar A.J.S.

Biol. 1995; 11: 519-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar for reviews). These findings include a requirement of passage through S phase, a functional autonomous replication sequence (ARS) flanking the silent locus HMR, and a functional origin recognition complex for silencing (reviewed in Ref. 2Loo S. Rine J. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 519-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). However, the requirement of DNA replication for silencing is obviated if the SIR1 silencing protein is recruited by alternative means, although passage through S phase is still essential (3Kirchmaier A.L. Rine J. Science. 2001; 291: 646-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 4Li Y-C. Cheng T-H. Gartenberg M.R. Science. 2001; 291: 650-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Thus, the exact connection between DNA replication and silencing is not clear. In the analogous system in Schizosaccharomyces pombe, the silent loci mat2P and mat3M are repressed by several trans-acting factors, namely Swi6 (5Lorentz A. Heim L. Schmidt H. Mol. Gen.

Dubey and J. Singh, unpublished data. In addition, these mutations also affect silencing at centromere and telomere loci (13Ekwall K. Nimmo E.R. Javerzat J-P. Borgstrom B. Egel R. Cranston G.

Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 218-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). Among these, Swi6 contains the conserved chromodomain motif that is associated with proteins involved in the assembly of heterochromatin in a large number of species, includingDrosophila, mice, and humans (15Lorentz A. Ostermann K. Fleck O. Schmidt H. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 143: 139-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), whereas the Clr4 protein performs an evolutionarily conserved function: it methylates the histone H3 at the Lys-9 position (16Rea S. Eisenhaber F. O'Carroll D. Strahl B.D. Sun Z.W. Schmid M. Opravil S. Mechtler K. Ponting C.P. Allis C.D. Jenuwein T.

Kouzarides T. Nature. 2001; 410: 120-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (2181) Google Scholar). Together these observations have suggested that DNA replication may play a role in mating type silencing in S. pombe. To check the possible role of DNA replication in silencing, we analyzed several temperature-sensitive (ts) mutants of DNA polymerase α, which is required for lagging strand synthesis during DNA replication in eukaryotes (18Waga S. Stillman B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 721-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar). We find that one such ts mutant, swi7H4 (19Murakami H. Okayama H. Nature. 1995; 374: 817-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar), is defective in silencing not only at mat2 and mat3 but also at centromere and telomere loci. Biochemical data show that DNA polα interacts with and regulates the localization of the evolutionarily conserved chromodomain protein Swi6 to themat loci. These results indicate a direct link between DNA replication and silencing through replication-mediated recruitment of Swi6 to heterochromatin. We believe that this mechanism of heterochromatin assembly may be conserved in all eukaryotes. Media components were purchased from Difco (Detroit, MI) or SRL (Mumbai, India).

Biol. 1998; 18: 5511-5522Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). A ChIP assay to detect Swi6 localization at the mat region was carried out as described (22Ekwall K. Partridge C.F. Bickmore W. Chromosome Structural Analysis: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, 1999: 47-57Google Scholar). The oligonucleotides used were GGGTAGGAAAAGAAGAGAGAGTAGTTGAAGG and CATACTAATAATGTAAGTAGAAGACC format1M (310 base pairs), GGTGCTCTTAATCTTGGATCC and ACTCGTTTCATAATGAATTGC for mat2P (215 base pairs), TGACAAAGCTTTTGTGG and TGTTAAAGCTTTTCTTCC for K region (700 base pairs), and GTCAGGATCCGCTGCTGAAAAGAAACC and ACTGGAATTCCTGAGGAGAAGAAGAATAC forH2B (395 base pairs). The PCR products were resolved by agarose gel electrophoresis and visualized by ethidium bromide staining or autoradiography. The localization of gfp-Swi6 was checked under Zeiss Axioplan fluorescence microscope as described (23Pidoux A.L. Ozawa S. Perry P.E. Cande W.Z. Allshire R.C. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 4177-4191Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,24Wang G. Ma A. Chow C.M. Horsley D. Brown N.R. Cowell I.G. Singh P.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6970-6983Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Multiple pictures were taken along the Z axis and merged. The swi6 gene (15Lorentz A. Ostermann K. Fleck O. Schmidt H. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 143: 139-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) was amplified from genomic DNA using forward oligonucleotide 5′-ATGCGGGATCCCAAGAAAGGAGGTGTTCG and reverse oligonucleotide 5′-ATGCGATTCATTTTCACGGAACGTTAAG. The PCR product was digested withBam HI and Eco RI and cloned at the same sites in pRSETA (Invitrogen) or pGEX1 vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). To express the MBP-Polα fusion protein, theXba I-Pst I fragment of the polα gene (25Singh J. Klar A.J.S. Nature. 1993; 361: 271-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) was cloned into the pMALp2 vector (New England Biolabs) at the same sites. For constructing the hemagglutinin-tagged Swi6, PCR was performed using forward oligonucleotide ATGCGGCCGCTAGCCATTCTGTACACC and reverse oligonucleotide CATGCGGCCGCCTTCATTTTCACGGAACGTTAAG. The PCR product was restricted with Not I and cloned atNot I site of the vector pREP1NHA. The Lacz-Polα fusion protein was expressed using the vector pUR292 inEscherichia coli. The protein was resolved by SDS-gel electrophoresis. The recombinant protein was stained with Coomassie Blue, gel-isolated, and injected into rabbits to obtain the antiserum. Polyclonal Swi6 antibody was a gift of R. Allshire. Immunodetection was carried using alkaline-phosphatase- (Promega) or horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. A crude extract (30 μg) containing MBP-Polα fusion protein was incubated with Ni-NTA (Qiagen, 100 μl of 2% suspension in binding buffer) to which recombinant (His)6-Swi6 had been immobilized. After collection of the unbound fraction and suitable washings with the binding buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl), the input, unbound flow through (FT), and bound (EL) fractions (residual beads) were subjected to immunoblotting. Ni-NTA beads (Qiagen) were equilibrated with binding buffer containing 50 mm NaH2PO4 (pH 8.0), 300 mm NaCl, and 10 mm imidazole. 300 μg of extract from cells expressing (His)6-Swi6 was allowed to bind the equilibrated Ni-NTA beads at 4 °C for 30–60 min. The beads were then washed with binding buffer containing 50 mmimidazole (30 min at 4 °C). After the washing step, 500 μg of the concentrated extract from cells of S. pombe (wild type and swi7H4) was added to the (His)6-swi6-conjugated Ni-NTA beads and mixed for 2 h at 4 °C. The mixture was centrifuged to obtain the supernatant (FT) fraction. After a single washing, the bound protein was eluted with 35 μl of elution buffer (binding buffer containing 250 mm imidazole). Elution was performed at 4 °C for 30 min. This represented the bound fraction (EL). A marker gene ura4, when placed at mat2, mat3, or cen (centromere) and telomere loci, is subject to silencing. Strains harboring such a marker grow poorly on plates lacking uracil (ura−; 6, 14). However, in silencing defective mutants such as swi6 and clr1-clr4, the expression of theura4 marker gene is enhanced, as indicated by increased growth level on ura− plates (6Thon G. Klar A.J.S. Genetics. 1993; 131: 287-296Crossref Google Scholar, 7Ekwall K. Ruusala T. Genetics. 1994; 136: 53-64Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Thon G. Cohen A. Klar A.J.S.

To check the requirement of DNA polα for silencing, several ts mutants ofpolα were generated in S. pombe, but they showed no silencing defect. However, swi7H4, an independently isolated ts mutant of polα with a replication checkpoint defect (19Murakami H. Okayama H. Nature. 1995; 374: 817-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar), elicited enhanced growth of strains carrying ura4 marker at mat2 and mat3 loci on ura− plates and reduced growth on FOA plates (FOA allows growth of ura− cells but not ura+cells; Fig. 1, a and b; see also Refs. 6Thon G. Klar A.J.S. Genetics. 1993; 131: 287-296Crossref Google Scholar and 20Moreno S. Klar A.J.S. Nurse P. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 194: 795-823Crossref Scopus (3142) Google Scholar), indicating a derepression of the ura4 gene. A heterothallic strain in which the centromere-proximal silencer element was deleted (denoted bysilencers I and II in Fig. 1 a), calledMsmto Δmat2::ura4 (8Thon G. Cohen A. Klar A.J.S. Genetics. 1994; 138: 29-38Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), also showed a higher growth level on ura− plates and no growth on FOA plates because of the swi7H4 mutation (Fig. 1 b). Heterothallic strains such as Msmto and Msmto Δmat2::ura4 do not switch and express only the minus (M) transcripts from the mat1 locus. Expression of the silent mat2P transcripts in these strains triggers meiosis, leading to sporulation in haploid cells (the phenotype is called haploid meiosis (hm)). The spores contain a starchy compound in their cell wall, which can be stained with iodine (20Moreno S. Klar A.J.S. Nurse P. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 194: 795-823Crossref Scopus (3142) Google Scholar). Thus, iodine staining as well as the hm phenotype indicates derepression of the silent mat2P locus in Msmto strain (8Thon G. Cohen A. Klar A.J.S. Genetics. 1994; 138: 29-38Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Moreno S. Klar A.J.S. Nurse P. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 194: 795-823Crossref Scopus (3142) Google Scholar). Earlier it was shown that in the Msmto background, the mutations in swi6, clr1-clr4 do not cause any increase in iodine staining although a derepression of themat-linked ura4 gene was observed (8Thon G. Cohen A. Klar A.J.S. Genetics. 1994; 138: 29-38Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, interestingly, when these mutants were analyzed in the silencer deletion background, a high level of haploid meiosis accompanied by increased iodine staining was observed, suggesting an interplay of the silencer and these trans-acting factors (8Thon G. Cohen A. Klar A.J.S. Genetics. 1994; 138: 29-38Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we checked the effect of the swi7H4 mutation in the silencer deletion background. The Msmto, swi7H4 strain does not give any iodine staining and no hm (0%; 0/400 cells; Fig.2 a). However, in the silencer deletion background (Msmto Δmat2::ura4), which itself does not cause any loss of silencing, the swi7H4 mutant colonies gave dark staining with iodine (Fig. 2 a) and a high level of hm (41%; 205/400 cells; Fig. 2 b), suggesting a loss of silencing. To check whether this increase in iodine staining and the level of haploid meiosis was due to enhanced expression of the silent transcript mat2Pc, quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR analysis was carried out. PCR under logarithmic conditions (10 cycles; see Ref. 10Singh J. Goel V. Klar A.J.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5511-5522Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) could not detect themat2Pc transcript (10Singh J. Goel V. Klar A.J.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5511-5522Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) in Msmto (Fig.2 c, lane 1) and Msmto Δmat2::ura4 strains (Fig. 2 c, lane 2). However, the Msmto, swi7H4 mutant strain expressed detectable mat2Pc transcript (Fig. 2 c, lane 3), which was elevated by ∼8-fold in the silencer deletion background (Msmto Δmat2::ura4 swi7H4; Fig.2 b, lane 4). The level of polα transcript was not affected (Fig. 2 c, lower panel), justifying its use as a control. These results indicate that DNA polα is required to establish silencing at themat2 locus, the efficiency of which is regulated by the cis-acting silencer. Because swi6 and clr1-clr4 mutants also do not give iodine staining in the Msmto background but yield dark staining in the silencer deletion background (Msmto Δmat2::ura4; Ref. 8Thon G. Cohen A. Klar A.J.S. Genetics. 1994; 138: 29-38Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), our results suggest that polα and Swi6 (and possibly Clr1-Clr4) may act at the same step in silencing. All the above assays were performed at 30 °C. It is possible that the swi7H4 mutation, which is reported to exert a checkpoint defect at 36 °C (19Murakami H. Okayama H. Nature. 1995; 374: 817-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar), may have a residual growth defect at 30 °C or may have a prolonged S phase. However, we found that the swi7H4 mutant grows at a level similar to wild type strains at 30 °C. Furthermore, both the polα and cds1 genes, which are known to suppress the ts and checkpoint defects of the swi7H4 mutant (19Murakami H. Okayama H. Nature. 1995; 374: 817-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar), allowed growth of the swi7H4 mutant at 36 °C (Fig. 3 a), confirming that both the genes suppress the growth defect of the swi7H4 mutant. Similarly, microscopic examination showed that although the mutant strain with the control vector still displayed the “cut” phenotype at 36 °C (chromosomes untimely torn; 13% of cells display cut phenotype after growth at 36 °C for 8 h), thepolα and cds1 genes suppressed this phenotype completely with 0% of cells displaying the cut phenotype (Fig.3 b). However, most interestingly, the dark staining of theswi7H4 strain in the silencer deletion background was not suppressed by either the polα and cds1 genes (Fig. 3 c). Therefore, the silencing defect in theswi7H4 mutant is not due to a prolonged S phase or replication checkpoint defect. On the other hand, the effect appears to be dominant, suggesting that the polα may participate in a silencing multimolecular complex. Because the silencing defect of the swi7H4 is dependent on the silencer, similar to Swi6 and Clr1-Clr4, we checked whether the silencing defect caused by the swi6 mutation requires DNA polα. Interestingly, we find that overexpression of swi6 gene could suppress the iodine staining of the swi6Δ strain in the silencer deletion background but not if theswi7H4 mutation was also present (Fig. 3 d). Thus, Swi6 requires wild type polα to establish silencing, and the effect of the swi7H4 mutation is dominant. Because mutations in swi6 and clr1-clr4 affect silencing at mat, centromere, and telomere loci, we also checked the effect of the swi7H4 mutation on silencing at the cen and telomere loci. The leaky expression of the ura4+ marker gene placed at three different locations within the cen1 locus (14Allshire R.C. Nimmo E.R. Ekwall K. Javerzat J-P. Cranston G. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 218-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar) was enhanced by the swi7H4 mutation, as indicated by reduced growth on FOA plates (Fig.4 a). Likewise, the expression of the his3 gene placed at the telomere locus on chromosome I, which was completely lacking in the wild type strains, was derepressed in the swi7H4 mutant, as indicated by growth on His− plates (Fig. 4 b). Thus, similar to the swi6 mutation (14Allshire R.C. Nimmo E.R. Ekwall K. Javerzat J-P. Cranston G. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 218-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar), the swi7H4 mutation also abrogates silencing at all three heterochromatin loci inS. pombe. Swi6p has been mainly localized to three heterochromatin loci, namely mat, telomere, and centromere, as revealed by fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis (22Ekwall K. Partridge C.F. Bickmore W. Chromosome Structural Analysis: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, 1999: 47-57Google Scholar), but becomes delocalized in clr4 and rik1 mutants (13Ekwall K. Nimmo E.R. Javerzat J-P. Borgstrom B. Egel R. Cranston G. Allshire R. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 2637-2648Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we checked Swi6 localization in the wild type and swi7H4 mutant by expressing a plasmid containing gfp-Swi6 fusion in place of the endogenous swi6 gene (23Pidoux A.L. Ozawa S. Perry P.E. Cande W.Z. Allshire R.C. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 4177-4191Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,24Wang G. Ma A. Chow C.M. Horsley D. Brown N.R. Cowell I.G. Singh P.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6970-6983Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Fluorescence microscopy showed that nearly 66% of nuclei contained three fluorescent foci in wild type cells with 26% of cells containing two foci and only 1% of cells having one foci; the remaining 7% of cells showed four foci. However, in swi7H4 mutant, the number of cells containing three foci was reduced by 50% with an increase in the number of cells with two or one foci by nearly 2 and 15-fold, respectively, as compared with the wild type cells (Fig.5 a). To directly assess the localization of Swi6 to the mat loci, we carried out the ChIP assay with wild type and swi7H4 mutant strains in which the hemagglutinin-tagged swi6 gene was inserted in place of the normal swi6 gene. The results of ChIP assay confirmed the Swi6 localization at mat1,mat2, and K regions in wild type cells (Fig. 5 b,lane 2) but not in the swi7H4 mutant (Fig.5 b, lane 5). Quantitative PCR showed a reduction in Swi6 localization by >10-fold in the swi7H4 mutant as compared with wild type cells, and the localization at mat1 and mat2 was 5-fold less than that at K region. 3S. Ahmed and J. Singh, unpublished results. No localization of Swi6 was detected at the control gene, histone H2B (Fig. 5 b,lane 2), even by radiolabeling.3 To check whether localization of Swi6 may be because of direct physical interaction between DNA polα and Swi6, we checked the binding of recombinant MBP-Polα fusion protein to the (His)6-tagged Swi6 protein immobilized on Ni-NTA resin. Results showed that MBP-Polα fusion protein was specifically retained by the Ni-NTA resin to which (His)6-tagged Swi6 was immobilized (Fig.6 a, compare lane 5 with lane 6) as the MBP-Polα fusion protein appeared in the bound fraction (Fig. 6 a, lane 5,EL) but not in the flow through fraction (Fig.6 a, lane 6, FT). MBP alone (Fig.6 a, lanes 11–13) did not bind as it appeared only in the flow through fraction (Fig. 6 a, lane 11, FT), not in the bound fraction (Fig. 6 a,lane 10, EL). Furthermore, MBP-Polα also did not bind to the Ni-NTA resin (Fig. 6 a) as it appeared only in the FT fraction not in the bound (EL) fraction when the binding of the MBP-Polα to the Ni-NTA resin was checked (Fig. 6 a,lanes 9 and 10). These results indicate that polα binds specifically to Swi6 in vitro. To check whether polα interacts with Swi6 in vivo, we transformed a construct carrying (His)6-taggedpolα gene in the vector pART1 (20Moreno S. Klar A.J.S. Nurse P. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 194: 795-823Crossref Scopus (3142) Google Scholar) into a strain carrying a disruption of the polα gene, as descried earlier (25Singh J. Klar A.J.S. Nature. 1993; 361: 271-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The whole cell extract prepared from these cells was fractionated by Ni-NTA chromatography to purify the (His)6-tagged polα protein by elution with 250 mm imidazole and immunoblotted. Interestingly, the bound fraction showed the presence of both polα and Swi6 as probed by the respective antibodies (Fig. 6 b,left panel). To check whether the binding of Swi6 to the Ni-NTA was because of copurification of Swi6 with polα and not due to nonspecific retention by the Ni-NTA resin, the binding of recombinant GST-Swi6 fusion protein to the Ni-NTA column was checked. Results showed that GST-Swi6 does not bind to the Ni-NTA column by itself as it appeared in the flow through (Fig. 6 b, right panel, lane 2, FT) but not in the bound (Fig. 6 b, right panel, lane 3,EL) fraction. These results strongly argue that polα also interacts with Swi6 in vivo. The delocalization of Swi6 in the swi7H4 mutant may be because of a lack of interaction between the swi7H4 mutant protein and Swi6, or it may be an indirect effect. To check this, we prepared extracts from the wild type and swi7H4 mutant cells and incubated them with Ni-NTA column to which (His)6-tagged Swi6 had been immobilized. After collecting, the FT and the bound (EL) fractions were eluted with 250 mmimidazole. The fractions were subjected to immunoblotting with anti-Polα antibody. Interestingly, we observed that although nearly 40% of the polα is bound to the Swi6 in the wild type extracts (Fig.6 c, lane 4, EL), no detectable band was observed in the bound fraction of the swi7H4 mutant extract (Fig. 6 c, lane 6, EL) as almost all of it appeared in the flow through fraction (Fig.6 c, lane 5, FT). Thus, although the wild type polα interacts with Swi6, the swi7H4 mutant polα does not give any detectable interaction with Swi6 in vitro. To find out whether mutations in certain regions of polα are required for silencing, we tested two other ts mutants of polα, namely, αts11 and αts13 (26Bhaumik D. Wang T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 2107-2123Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and the viable mutant of polα namely swi7–1 (25Singh J. Klar A.J.S. Nature. 1993; 361: 271-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Interestingly, both αts11 and αts13 mutants also exhibited iodine staining (Fig.7 a) and haploid meiosis in theMsmto background, indicating a silencing def"

Activation of cyclin E·Cdk2 through abrogation of the ability of p21WAF1/Cip1 to bind to and inhibit cyclin-CDKs is a pivotal event in this process in MCF-7 breast cancer cells. A proposed mechanism is p21 sequestration into cyclin D1·Cdk4/6 complexes driven by estrogen-induced transcriptional activation of cyclin D1 gene expression. However, we now show that some E2-induced cyclin E·Cdk2 activation occurs in the absence of increased cyclin D1 levels and requires decreased p21 protein synthesis. Both mechanisms operate in the absence of major changes in total p21 protein levels and instead target a low abundance subset of newly synthesized p21. E2-induced activation of cyclin E·Cdk2 is mimicked by targeted inhibition of nascent p21 expression by antisense p21 oligonucleotides. Cyclin E·Cdk2 activation is completely inhibited by a combination of antisense cyclin D1 oligonucleotide transfection and elimination of the decrease in nascent p21 by infection with adenoviral-p21. These findings strongly support a central role for p21 in the early phase of E2-induced mitogenesis and highlight a major functional role for newly synthesized CDK inhibitory proteins.

Increased cyclin E expression and cyclin E·Cdk2 activity have also been implicated in the development of breast cancer.

Furthermore, the levels of cyclin E and cyclin E-associated kinase activity in breast cancer cell lines are commonly elevated (3Keyomarsi K. O'Leary N. Molnar G. Lees E. Fingert H.J. Pardee A.B.

Estrogen-dependent activation of the estrogen receptor (ER)1is essential for normal breast and uterine cell proliferation (7Couse J.F. Korach K.S. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 358-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar) and approximately two-thirds of breast tumors retain estrogen sensitivity. However, the molecular mechanisms through which estrogen stimulates the proliferation of breast cancer cells have not been fully defined. Estrogens stimulate the expression of growth factor genes, which may exert indirect effects on proliferation through autocrine and paracrine mechanisms. In addition they induce the expression of several early- and intermediate-response genes with demonstrated roles in cell cycle progression, e.g. c-fos, jun-B, c-myc, and cyclin D1 (8Dickson R.B. Lippman M.E. Endocr. Rev. 1995; 16: 559-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). More recently, estrogens have been shown to stimulate the Src/Ras/MAP kinase pathway via mechanisms that require functional ER (9Migliaccio A. Di Domenico M. Castoria G. de Falco A. Bontempo P.

Although the interactions between these components of the estrogen response remain to be fully elucidated, there is now compelling evidence that activation of cyclin E·Cdk2 plays a pivotal role in linking ER signaling to S phase entry (11Foster J.S.

Considerable biochemical and genetic evidence indicates multiple levels of regulation of cyclin E·Cdk2, including transcriptional activation ofcyclin E gene expression, association with the Cip/KIP family of CDK inhibitor proteins (p21Cip1/WAF1, p27KIP1, p57KIP2) and inhibition/activation through phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of specific amino acids on Cdk2 (28Morgan D.O.

Cyclin E·Cdk2 activation in MCF-7 cells occurs 4–6 h after estradiol (E2) treatment, increases to 3-fold above control levels at 8 h, and increases to ∼7-fold at 16 h (12Prall O.W.J. Sarcevic B.

Interestingly, p21 is the major cyclin E·Cdk2 inhibitory protein during early cyclin E·Cdk2 activation in this model with little contribution from p27 (12Prall O.W.J. Sarcevic B. Musgrove E.A.

Cyclin E·Cdk2 activation coincides with a decrease in the ability of endogenous p21 to associate with cyclin E·Cdk2 in vitro, but the mechanism remains undefined (12Prall O.W.J. Sarcevic B.

Furthermore, the Cdk2 component of these active cyclin E·Cdk2 complexes is phosphorylated on threonine 160, a target of CDK-activating kinase (CAK). Because CAK activity is unaltered by estrogen treatment, Cdk2 phosphorylation is most likely due to the absence of p21, which inhibits phosphorylation of this residue by CAK (30Aprelikova O. Xiong Y. Liu E.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18195-18197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Active cyclin E·Cdk2 complexes in MCF-7 cells are associated with the pRb-related pocket protein p130 (14Prall O.W.J. Rogan E.M. Musgrove E.A. Watts C.K.W. Sutherland R.L. Mol. Cell.

These observations strongly suggest that the reduction in p21-associated cyclin E·Cdk2 is critical to cyclin E·Cdk2 activation by E2. However, there are no major changes in the levels of p21, p130, cyclin E, or Cdk2 in cyclin E complexes following E2 treatment (12Prall O.W.J. Sarcevic B. Musgrove E.A. Watts C.K.W. Sutherland R.L.

Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4059-4069Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). A p21/p27-sequestering role for cyclin D1 has also been implicated in mediating the effects of transforming growth factor β and INK4 protein inhibition on G1 phase progression (31Jiang H. Chou H.S. Zhu L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5284-5290Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Reynisdottir I. Massague J. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 492-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 33Reynisdottir I.

However, although ectopic expression of cyclin D1 causes increased cyclin D1·Cdk4·p21 association, it is not sufficient to mimic E2-dependent cyclin E·Cdk2 activation quantitatively (14Prall O.W.J. Rogan E.M. Musgrove E.A. Watts C.K.W. Sutherland R.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4499-4508Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Further evidence for the existence of a cyclin E·Cdk2-activating mechanism independent of cyclin D1·Cdk4 sequestration comes from our data demonstrating that c-Myc can induce activation of cyclin E·Cdk2 and cell cycle progression in antiestrogen-arrested MCF-7 cells without concurrent increases in cyclin D1·Cdk4·p21 complexes (14Prall O.W.J. Rogan E.M. Musgrove E.A. Watts C.K.W. Sutherland R.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4499-4508Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). We now identify a low abundance pool of p21 that readily associates with cyclin E·Cdk2 in vitro and is targeted by E2 in vivo by dual mechanisms: sequestration by cyclin D1; and decreased p21 protein synthesis secondary to decreased p21 gene transcription. The unexpected finding that substantial increases in cyclin E·Cdk2 activity were caused by decreases in this small nascent pool of p21 may have broader relevance to activation of cyclin E·Cdk2 by other mitogens. Numerous lines of evidence indicate that activation of cyclin E·Cdk2 is crucial to G1 to S phase progression. Increased cyclin E expression and cyclin E·Cdk2 activity have also been implicated in the development of breast cancer. Cyclin E overexpression induces mammary gland hyperplasia and carcinoma in mice (1Bortner D.M. Rosenberg M.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 453-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), and deregulated cyclin E·Cdk2 activity causes chromosome instability in human breast epithelial cells (2Spruck C.H. Won K.A. Reed S.I. Nature. 1999; 401: 297-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the levels of cyclin E and cyclin E-associated kinase activity in breast cancer cell lines are commonly elevated (3Keyomarsi K. O'Leary N. Molnar G. Lees E. Fingert H.J. Pardee A.B. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 380-385PubMed Google Scholar, 4Sweeney K.J. Swarbrick A. Sutherland R.L. Musgrove E.A. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 2865-2878Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) and correlate with poor outcome in breast cancer patients (5Nielsen N.H. Arnerlov C. Emdin S.O. Landberg G. Br. J.

Estrogen-dependent activation of the estrogen receptor (ER)1is essential for normal breast and uterine cell proliferation (7Couse J.F. Korach K.S. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 358-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar) and approximately two-thirds of breast tumors retain estrogen sensitivity. However, the molecular mechanisms through which estrogen stimulates the proliferation of breast cancer cells have not been fully defined. Estrogens stimulate the expression of growth factor genes, which may exert indirect effects on proliferation through autocrine and paracrine mechanisms. In addition they induce the expression of several early- and intermediate-response genes with demonstrated roles in cell cycle progression, e.g. c-fos, jun-B, c-myc, and cyclin D1 (8Dickson R.B. Lippman M.E. Endocr. Rev. 1995; 16: 559-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). More recently, estrogens have been shown to stimulate the Src/Ras/MAP kinase pathway via mechanisms that require functional ER (9Migliaccio A. Di Domenico M. Castoria G. de Falco A. Bontempo P. Nola E. Auricchio F. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1292-1300Crossref PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar, 10Migliaccio A. Piccolo D. Castoria G. Di Domenico M. Bilancio A. Lombardi M. Gong W. Beato M.

Although the interactions between these components of the estrogen response remain to be fully elucidated, there is now compelling evidence that activation of cyclin E·Cdk2 plays a pivotal role in linking ER signaling to S phase entry (11Foster J.S.

Histone deacetylases have recently been shown to play an important role in regulating gene expression. Here we investigated whether a more tightly controlled expression could be achieved by using a novel chimeric repressor that recruits histone deacetylases to a tetracycline-responsive promoter. This chimeric repressor was engineered by fusing the tetracycline repressor (TetR) with an mSin3-interacting domain of human Mad1 and was shown to bind the tetO2 element with high affinity, and its binding was efficiently abrogated by doxycycline. The chimeric repressor was shown to directly interact with mSin3 of the histone deacetylase complex. This inducible system was further simplified by using a single vector that contained both a chimeric repressor expression cassette and a tetracycline-responsive promoter. When transiently introduced into mammalian cells, the chimeric repressor system exhibited a significantly lower basal level of luciferase activity (up to 25-fold) than that of the TetR control. When stably transfected into HEK 293 cells, the chimeric repressor system was shown to exert a tight control of green fluorescent protein expression in a doxycycline dose- and time-dependent fashion. Therefore, this novel chimeric repressor provides an effective means for more tightly regulated gene expression, and the simplified inducible system may be used for a broad range of basic and clinical studies.

The Tc-inducible system is derived from the gene regulation features of Tc resistance determinants in Gram-negative bacteria (27Hillen W. Berens C. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1994; 48: 345-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). Each Tc determinant consists of a resistance protein (e.g. TetB) and a regulatory/repressor protein (i.e. TetR). The TetR protein regulates the expression of seven Tc resistance proteins. In the absence of Tc, TetR is bound to the tet operon (tetO2 ). In the presence of Tc, TetR binds to Tc allosterically and rapidly dissociates from tetO2 , allowing expression of Tc resistance proteins (28Takahashi M. Degenkolb J. Hillen W. Anal.

Rossi F.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 797-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Gene expression in eukaryotes regulated by TetR was first demonstrated in plant cells (37Gatz C. Quail P.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 1394-1397Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Subsequently, Tc-responsive promoters were developed for regulated gene expression in mammalian cells (19Gossen M. Bujard H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5547-5551Crossref PubMed Scopus (4268) Google Scholar, 38Gossen M. Freundlieb S. Bender G. Muller G. Hillen W. Bujard H.

Despite significant improvements in the Tc-inducible systems (2Rossi F.M. Blau H.M. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1998; 9: 451-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 36Blau H.M. Rossi F.M. Proc.

Cell. 2000; 6: 723-728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), two significant shortcomings have limited their use in many circumstances. First, they usually exhibit a significant level of basal expression. This “leakiness” makes it difficult to establish inducible clones expressing toxic genes, tumor suppressor genes, or genes involved in apoptosis. Second, they require two-stage transfections to establish stable inducible lines. This can be problematic because clonal variations may affect functional outcomes of a given gene. Recently, significant progress has been made in understanding eukaryotic gene regulation in the context of chromatin. Activation and repression of gene expression correlates with the acetylation state of histones (43Struhl K. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 599-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (1557) Google Scholar, 44Workman J.L. Kingston R.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 545-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (975) Google Scholar, 45Luo R.X. Dean D.C. J. Natl.

Acetylated histones are correlated with active gene expression, whereas deacetylated histones are correlated with repressed gene expression. Recently, enzymes that carry out histone acetylation (histone acetyltransferases) and deacetylation (histone deacetylases, or HDACs) have been identified. Transcription activators are often associated with histone acetyltransferases, and repressors can interact with HDACs, leading to local chromatin modification of specific genes (47Hassig C.A. Schreiber S.L. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1997; 1: 300-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar, 48Kuo M.H. Allis C.D.

Verdel A. Lemercier C. Seigneurin-Berny D. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2001; 11: 162-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). One of the most important HDACs is conferred by the mSin3 complex, which is comprised of at least seven subunits (51Ng H.H. Bird A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 121-126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar, 52Ahringer J. Trends Genet. 2000; 16: 351-356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). The Mad-Max complex has been shown to repress gene expression via an association with the mSin3 complex (53Pazin M.J. Kadonaga J.T. Cell. 1997; 89: 325-328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (772) Google Scholar). The Myc/Max/Mad network comprises a group of transcription factors whose distinct interactions result in gene-specific transcriptional activation or repression (54Grandori C. Cowley S.M. James L.P. Eisenman R.N. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 653-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (1040) Google Scholar). By forming heterodimers, the Myc-Mad complex recruits co-activators and activates E-box-containing promoters, whereas the Mad-Max heterodimer functions as a transcriptional repressor (54Grandori C. Cowley S.M. James L.P. Eisenman R.N. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 653-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (1040) Google Scholar, 55Schreiber-Agus N. DePinho R.A. Bioessays. 1998; 20: 808-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Recently, Mad1-mediated repression has been shown to require the formation of a ternary complex with Max and mSin3. The mSin3 interaction domain (SID) has been mapped to the N-terminal 35 amino acid residues of human Mad1 protein (56Ayer D.E. Laherty C.D. Lawrence Q.A. Armstrong A.P. Eisenman R.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5772-5781Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). To test whether a chimeric TetR repressor that recruits HDACs can confer a tight regulation of gene expression, we engineered a hybrid repressor, namely TRSID, by fusing the TetR with a SID derived from human Mad1 protein (56Ayer D.E. Laherty C.D. Lawrence Q.A. Armstrong A.P. Eisenman R.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5772-5781Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). TRSID was shown to retaintetO2 binding ability and Tc inducibility and was also shown to directly interact with the mSin3·HDAC complex. By using a single vector system that contained both a chimeric repressor expression cassette and a Tc-responsive promoter, we have demonstrated that the chimeric repressor exhibited significantly tighter regulation of gene expression, and its repression was efficiently relieved by doxycycline. This tightly controlled gene expression system should be valuable for a wide range of gene function studies and clinical applications. Human embryonic kidney cell line HEK 293, human colon cancer line HCT116, and human osteosarcoma line 143B were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). 293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Mediatech, Herndon, VA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Mediatech), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in 5% CO2. HCT116 cells were maintained in McCoys 5A (Mediatech) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in 5% CO2. 143B cells were maintained in Eagle's minimal essential medium (Mediatech) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2.0 mml-glutamine, 1× nonessential amino acids (Mediatech), 1.0 mm sodium pyruvate, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Mediatech) at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Unless otherwise indicated, all chemicals were purchased from Sigma. Both TetR and TRSID expression cassettes were constructed by multiple subcloning steps. Details of cloning procedures are available upon request. Briefly, the TetR coding sequence (underlined) was amplified by polymerase chain reaction with the following pair of oligonucleotides: 5′-CCGCTCGAGATGTCTAGATTAGATAAAAGTAAAG-3′ and 5′-CATGCATGCTTAGGACCCACTTTCACATTTAAGTTG-3′. The amplified fragment was cloned into pSL301 (Invitrogen) atXhoI and SphI sites, resulting in pSL-TetR. The SID was amplified with the following pair of oligonucleotides: 5′-GATCCATATGCGGATTAGAAAAACAACTTAAATGTGAAA GTGGGTCCGGACCGGGTATGGCGGCGGCGGTTCGGATG-3′ and 5′-CGCGGATCCTTAGTCCTTGTTATTGTATGGTAAC-3′ (the TetR sequence is underlined, and the SID sequence is italicized). To construct the hybrid repressor TRSID, the amplified SID fragment was subcloned into pSL-TetR at the NdeI and BamHI sites to replace the 3′-end of TetR sequence, resulting in pSL-TRSID. Subsequently, an internal ribosome entry site (IRES)-neomycin resistance cassette was added to the 3′-end of both TetR and TRSID to enable a bicistronic expression of TetR or TRSID, and a geneticin resistance selection marker in mammalian cells. The final expression cassettes for both TetR (CMV-TetR-IRES-Neo-SV40 PA) and TRSID (CMV-TRSID-IRES-Neo-SV40 PA) were flanked with MluI sites and were readily subcloned into the pCMV-TO4 vector (see below). All polymerase chain reaction-amplified DNA fragments were sequenced to verify their nucleotide sequence authenticity. To engineer a tetO2-containing CMV promoter that is responsive to TetR or the chimeric repressor TRSID, we designed two overlapping oligonucleotides that contained four copies of the tet operator sitetetO2 (underlined) and multiple cloning sites (italicized): 5′-GCAGAGCTCTCCCTATCAGT GATAGAGATCTCCCTATCAGTGATAGAGATCTCCCTATCAGTGATAGAGATCTCCCTATCAGTGATAGAGATCGAGCTGTTTAGTGAACCGTCAG-3′ and 5′-CGAGCGGCCGC TCGAGTTAACCGCGGACCGGTCGACAGGCCTGAATTCGGTGTCTTCTATGGAGGTCAAAACAGCGTGGATGGCGTCTCCAGGCGATCTGACGGTTCACTAAACAGC-3′. Two oligonucleotides were denatured, annealed, and extended with Platinum Taq (Life Technologies, Inc.) for one cycle to generate a cassette that was subsequently cloned downstream to a CMV promoter, resulting in pCMV-TO4. In this vector, the firsttetO2 site was precisely positioned 10 nucleotides downstream from the TATA box of the CMV promoter (Fig.1 B). The cloned fragment was verified by DNA sequencing. Finally, the MluI fragment containing the TetR or TRSID expression cassette (see above) was subcloned into the pCMV-TO4 vector, generating pTRE and pTHE, respectively. Other vectors were also constructed, including pTRE-GFP, pTHE-GFP, pTRE-Luc, and pTHE-Luc. DNA sequences and maps for pTRE and pTHE vectors are available at the following website: mywebpage.netscape.com/ucmolab/home.html. For the construction of GST fusion proteins with TetR or the chimeric repressor TRSID, the coding sequences of TetR or TRSID were subcloned into pGEX-3X (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at a filled-inEcoRI site, resulting in pGST-TetR and pGST-TRSID, respectively. The cloning junctions were verified by DNA sequencing. Purification of GST fusion proteins was performed essentially as described previously (57He T.C. Sparks A.B. Rago C. Hermeking H. Zawel L. da Costa L.T. Morin P.J. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Science. 1998; 281: 1509-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (4092) Google Scholar). Briefly, exponentially growing BL21 bacterial cells that contained GST fusion vectors were induced with 0.1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 4 h at 37 °C. Cells were collected and lysed by sonication. GST fusion proteins were purified by using glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and eluted with reduced glutathione (10 mm, Sigma). The purified proteins were quantified by using a BCA-200 Protein Assay kit (Pierce) and kept at −80 °C. DNA binding assays were performed essentially as described previously (57He T.C. Sparks A.B. Rago C. Hermeking H. Zawel L. da Costa L.T. Morin P.J. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Science. 1998; 281: 1509-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (4092) Google Scholar). Briefly, each DNA binding assay was supplemented with 0.1–0.2 μg of GST fusion proteins; a nonspecific competitor, poly(dI-dC) (6 μg/ml); and 0.5 ng of 32P-labeled probe (≈106 dpm). For competition assays, a 50-fold excess of unlabeled probe was added. ThetetO2 probe was formed by annealing 5′-CTCCCTATCAGTGATAGAGAT-3′ and 5′-ATCTCTATCACT GATAGGGAG-3′. To test Tc inducibility, various amounts (ranging from 0.01 to 10.0 ng) of doxycycline were added to the DNA binding assays. Exponentially growing 293 cells were collected and lysed in a cell lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40) containing protease inhibitors (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The cleared cell lysate was incubated with 0.5 mg of GST-TetR or GST-TRSID proteins at 4 °C for 60 min. Next 100 μl of a 50% slurry glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was added to the GST fusion protein mixtures. As a control, an equal volume of cleared lysate was incubated with 100 μl of a 50% slurry of glutathione-Sepharose 4B. After 30 min of incubation at 4 °C, the protein-bound glutathione-Sepharose 4B was washed with phosphate-buffered saline three times. Bound proteins were eluted by boiling the samples in Laemmli sample buffer and were loaded onto a 4–20% gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gel. After being resolved by electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to an Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore) via electroblotting. The membrane was blocked with 5% nonfat milk in TBST (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) at room temperature for 1 h and probed with a rabbit anti-mSin3A antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 60 min followed by a 30-min incubation with anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Pierce). The presence of mSin3 protein was detected by using the SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate kit (Pierce). Exponentially growing cells were seeded in 12-well cell culture plates for 4 h and transfected with 0.2 μg of a luciferase reporter plasmid and 0.2 μg of pCMV-β per well using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.). At 15 h after transfection, doxycycline (100 ng/ml) was added to the transfected cells. At 48 h after induction, cells were lysed and collected for assays of luciferase activity using the Luciferase Assay kit (Promega). Each assay condition was done in triplicate, and transfection efficiency was normalized by β-galactosidase assays. HEK 293 cells were plated in a 25-cm2 flask and transfected with 2 μg of PacI-linearized pTHE-GFP plasmid DNA by using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.). At 24 h after transfection, cells were replated into 96-well plates with various densities and selected in G418 (0.3 mg/ml) for 2 weeks. Clones derived from single cells were grown up for further analysis. Controlled gene expression is important for gene function studies and therapeutic applications. Despite improvements, current Tc-inducible systems continue to be limited by two factors: high basal level of expression and inconvenient two-stage establishment of inducible lines (2Rossi F.M. Blau H.M. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1998; 9: 451-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 36Blau H.M. Rossi F.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 797-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). In an attempt to reduce the basal level of expression, we constructed a hybrid repressor, TRSID, which contained the full-length TetR fused with a well characterized SID (amino acids 1–44) derived from human Mad1 protein (Fig. 1 A). A small linker sequence, Gly-Pro-Gly, was introduced between the two moieties. It has been demonstrated that the SID is necessary and sufficient to recruit histone deacetylases to the vicinity of the transcription start site and to repress transcription activity (56Ayer D.E. Laherty C.D. Lawrence Q.A. Armstrong A.P. Eisenman R.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5772-5781Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Proper configuration of the chimeric repressor TRSID was verified by DNA sequencing. The prototypic TetR was included as a control for our studies (Fig. 1 A). To engineer a TRSID-mediated repression system, we introduced four copies of the canonicaltetO2 site in the context of a CMV promoter. To maximize the potential suppressive effects of the repressor proteins, we placed the first copy of the tetO2 site precisely 10 base pairs downstream of the TATA box (Fig.1 B). We next tested whether the hybrid repressor TRSID retained its ability to bind the tetO2 element. To facilitate these assays, we constructed a GST fusion protein, GST-TRSID, as well as GST-TetR for a control (Fig.2 A). As indicated in electrophoretic mobility shift assays, the tetO2 binding capability of the chimeric repressor TRSID was not affected by the fusion construction (Fig. 2 B). Interestingly, the binding of TRSID to the tetO2 element was reproducibly shown to be slightly stronger than that of the control TetR protein. Reasons for the enhanced binding ability of TRSID are not known. Previous studies have indicated that although mutations in other regions also significantly affect its Tc-induced allosterical conformational changes, Tc inducibility is mostly determined by the carboxyl portion of the TetR protein (28Takahashi M. Degenkolb J. Hillen W. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 199: 197-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 29Kaszycki P. Guz A. Drwiega M. Wasylewski Z. J.

Biol. 2000; 7: 215-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). To assess whether the chimeric TRSID retained this inducibility, we included doxycycline, a water-soluble and more stable analogue of Tc, in the electrophoretic mobility shift assay reactions. As illustrated in Fig. 2 C, addition of doxycycline at a concentration as low as 1.0 ng/ml significantly reduced the tetO2 binding ability of TRSID protein, which was completely abolished when 10 ng of doxycycline was used. There was no significant difference in the inducibility between control TetR and TRSID proteins (Fig.2 C). Taken together, these observations demonstrate that the chimeric TRSID repressor exhibited similar biochemical features to those of the control TetR. We next tested whether the TRSID directly interacted with the mSin3 complex. Total cell lysate prepared from 293 cells was incubated with ∼0.5 mg of GST-TetR or GST-TRSID followed by an incubation with glutathione-Sepharose 4B. As a control for nonspecific binding to the beads, total cell lysate was also incubated with glutathione-Sepharose 4B. Bound proteins were eluted and subjected to Western blotting analysis. The presence of mSin3 was probed with an anti-mSin3A antibody. As shown in Fig. 2 D, a specific interaction between mSin3 and TRSID was readily detected. To circumvent the requirement of a two-stage transfection to establish Tc-inducible lines, we developed a single system, namely the Tc-controlled heterologousexpression (THE) system (Fig. 1 C). Specifically, in the pTHE system, a single vector contains two independent expression cassettes. The first one contains a TetR- or TRSID-responsive expression cassette, and the second cassette contains a CMV-driven bicistronic expression of a repressor protein (e.g. TetR or TRSID) and a G418 selection marker (Neor), which was mediated by an IRES. The bicistronic configuration ensures a concordant expression of the repressor protein in G418-resistant cells. To further facilitate establishment of stable cells, octanucleotide-recognizing restriction endonuclease sites ofPacI, PmeI, and AscI were engineered for construct linearization. It is expected that expression of a transgene would be suppressed by repressor TetR or TRSID and activated in the presence of Tc or doxycycline. Depending on the repressor, resultant vectors were designated as pTRE (i.e. TetR as a repressor) and pTHE (i.e. TRSID as a repressor), respectively (Fig. 1 C). To initially assess whether gene regulation was under a tight control in the pTHE vector, we constructed two reporter plasmids, pTHE-Luc and a control reporter, pTRE-Luc, both of which contained a gene encoding luciferase under the control of atetO2 -bearing CMV promoter. Upon introduction of reporter vectors into three mammalian cells (HEK 293, HCT116, and 143B), expression of luciferase was induced by doxycycline. Luciferase activity was assayed 48 h after induction. As summarized in TableI, the luciferase activity of both pTRE-Luc- and pTHE-Luc-transfected cells was significantly induced by doxycycline in all three tested cell lines. Levels of induction were higher in 293 cells for pTRE-Luc (approximately 22-fold) and 143B cells for pTHE-Luc (approximately 60-fold). Moreover, a significant decrease of basal luciferase activity was documented in all the pTHE-Luc-transfected cell lines. The greatest reduction of basal activity was found in the 143B cells (approximately 26-fold decrease) when the luciferase activity of the uninduced state in pTRE-Luc- and pTHE-Luc-transfected cells was compared. It is noteworthy that the maximum activity induced by doxycycline seemed to be lower in the pTHE-Luc-transfected cells (especially in 143B and 293 cells). This result is consistent with that observed using the pTHE-GFP inducible vector (see below). Nevertheless, these quantitative data strongly suggest that the chimeric repressor drastically reduced the basal level of expression. Interestingly, the magnitude of induction and the fold of reduction in basal activity exhibited significant variations among the three cell lines tested. Although the actual causes of these differences remain undefined, there may be two contributing factors. First, it seemed that a higher basal level of luciferase activity was directly related to higher transfection efficiency. We observed that among the three lines HEK 293 cells exhibited the highest efficiency of transfection and 143B cells exhibited the lowest. Second, the advantage of the chimeric repressor system may not be fully exploited in transient expression assays. Mechanistically, it is expected that the basal activity of pTHE system would be more significantly suppressed by the HDACs once the inducible vectors stably integrate into the host chromosomes.Table IComparison of doxycycline (Dox)-induced luciferase activity using pTRE and pTHE inducible vectorsCell lineTRE-LucTHE-Luc−Dox+Dox−Dox+Dox143B Mean (S.D.)36,265 (7,985)159,997 (47,241)1,391 (306)83,288 (15,789) -Fold induction4.459.9 -Fold decrease in basal level26.1HCT116 Mean (S.D.)133,589 (34,448)504,385 (57,917)39,551 (6,229)440,728 (29,188) -Fold induction3.811.1 -Fold decrease in basal level3.4HEK 293 Mean (S.D.)249,950 (31,907)5,534,640 (1,570,912)125,756 (13,385)441,524 (65,350) -Fold induction22.13.5 -Fold decrease in basal level2 Open table in a new tab To further test the efficacy and kinetic features of the pTHE inducible system in mammalian cells, we constructed two GFP reporter vectors: pTHE-GFP and pTRE-GFP. After the vectors were transiently introduced into HEK 293 cells, expression of GFP was induced by doxycycline (at 100 ng/ml). As shown in Fig.3 A, GFP expression was readily detectable at 48 h after induction in both pTHE-GFP- and pTRE-GFP-transfected cells. However, the basal level of GFP expression was significantly higher in the pTRE-GFP-transfected cells than in the pTHE-GFP-transfected cells, strongly suggesting that the chimeric repressor TRSID indeed enhances the repression of basal expression on the tetO2 -responsive promoter. To further assess the kinetic characteristics of gene expression in the THE inducible system, we generated multiple HEK 293 clones that were stably transfected with the pTHE-GFP vector. We observed that on average about 10–20% of the stable clones derived from single cells were tightly regulated by doxycycline, and the tightly controlled expression was well retained in the cells recovered from cryogenic preservation. As illustrated in Fig. 3 B, GFP expression was induced in a doxycycline dose-dependent manner. Apparent GFP expression was induced by doxycycline at a concentration as low as 0.5 ng/ml. Like most Tc-inducible systems, the dosage range of induction was fairly narrow (less than 10-fold) because GFP expression was induced close to the maximum level at 1.0 ng/ml doxycycline. In a time course study, we observed that appreciable GFP expression could be induced as early as 6 h but that the maximum level of induction was achieved at 24 h after induction (Fig. 3 C). Thus, our collective data have demonstrated that the pTHE inducible system can tightly regulate gene expression in a Tc-dependent fashion and that the chimeric TRSID repressor significantly reduces the basal level of expression from atetO2-containing CMV promoter. The arrival of the postgenomic era mandates the development of tightly regulated expression technologies for gene function studies as well as gene therapy. As one of the most commonly used methods, conventional Tc-inducible systems usually exhibit a significant basal level of expression and require a two-stage procedure to establish stable inducible lines (2Rossi F.M. Blau H.M. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1998; 9: 451-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 58Gschwend J.E. Fair W.R. Powell C.T. Prostate. 1997; 33: 166-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). To overcome these shortcomings, we engineered a tightly controlled gene expression (pTHE) system mediated by a chimeric repressor that recruits histone deacetylases. The development of the pTHE inducible vector has conceptually benefited from recent progress in our understanding of chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation. Recent studies have demonstrated that the acetylation status of histones is a key determinant of transcriptional activity. Transcriptional activators are often associated with histone acetyltransferases and repressors interacting with HDACs. Recruitment of HDACs to specific promoter regions plays a major role in silencing gene expression (43Struhl K. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 599-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (1557) Google Scholar, 44Workman J.L. Kingston R.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 545-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (975) Google Scholar, 45Luo R.X. Dean D.C. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1999; 91: 1288-1294Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 46Orphanides G. Reinberg D. Nature. 2000; 407: 471-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). To exploit the gene silencing function of HDACs, we created a hybrid repressor by fusing the TetR with an mSin3 interaction domain of human Mad1 repressor (56Ayer D.E. Laherty C.D. Lawrence Q.A. Armstrong A.P. Eisenman R.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5772-5781Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). As assessed by electrophoretic mobility shift assays, the chimeric repressor TRSID was shown to retain its ability to specifically bind thetetO2 element with high affinity. Furthermore, the TRSID binding to tetO2 was dramatically reduced or abolished in a doxycycline dose-dependent fashion, suggesting that the chimeric repressor retained Tc inducibility. To avoid the conventional two-step establishment of stable lines, we constructed a single vector system, namely the pTHE vector, as well as a control vector, pTRE. Quantitative analyses using luciferase as a reporter demonstrated that the chimeric TRSID repressor significantly suppressed the basal level of expression. Accordingly, GFP expression in pTHE-GFP system is tightly regulated by doxycycline in a time course- and dosage-dependent manner. It is noteworthy that the maximum level of gene expression was slightly lower in pTHE-GFP-transfected cells than that in pTRE-GFP-transfected cells. For reasons yet to be understood, this may reflect the fact that the chimeric repressor may bind tetO2 with a higher affinity as suggested by the in vitro electrophoretic mobility shift assay results. Nevertheless, the Tc-induced expression of transgenes should remain high enough for most in vitro orin vivo studies. Since Bujard et al. (19Gossen M. Bujard H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5547-5551Crossref PubMed Scopus (4268) Google Scholar, 38Gossen M. Freundlieb S. Bender G. Muller G. Hillen W. Bujard H. Science. 1995; 268: 1766-1769Crossref PubMed Scopus (2051) Google Scholar) developed the prototypic Tc-inducible system for mammalian cells by converting TetR to a Tc-controlled transactivator (tTA), several modifications have been made. For instance, Shockett et al. (59Shockett P. Difilippantonio M. Hellman N. Schatz D.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6522-6526Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar) developed an autoregulatory tTA production for a Tc-inducible system that functioned in cultured cells and transgenic mice. In a series of studies, Blau and colleagues (40Kringstein A.M. Rossi F.M. Hofmann A. Blau H.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Urlinger et al. (61Urlinger S. Baron U. Thellmann M. Hasan M.T. Bujard H. Hillen W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7963-7968Crossref PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar) conducted a comprehensive mutagenic analysis and optimized the rtTA protein with a broader range of regulation and higher sensitivity. To avoid the potential toxicity associated with the VP16 transactivation domain, Akagi et al. (62Akagi K. Kanai M. Saya H. Kozu T. Berns A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: E23Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) have recently constructed a novel Tc-dependent transactivator with an E2F4 transcriptional activation domain. On the contrary, several groups have explored the silencing potential of the TetR in mammalian cells (63Kim H.J. Gatz C. Hillen W. Jones T.R. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 2565-2573Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 64Deuschle U. Meyer W.K. Thiesen H.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1907-1914Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 65Kim H.J. Kim K.H.

Gene Ther. 1998; 9: 1939-1950Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). The development of the THE inducible system has further exploited the potent silencing function of gene expression mediated by histone deacetylases. Thus, our THE inducible system should be superior to the current Tc-inducible system in the following areas. 1) It does not alter the intrinsic biochemical function of the prototypic TetR, which is to suppress gene expression. 2) Strong exogenous transactivators (e.g. VP16), which may cause cellular toxicity due to overexpression, are not required for gene regulation. 3) It is more feasible to construct a single vector for a repressor-mediated inducible system because the close proximity of repressor and its responsive element would less likely interfere with each other and hence should not compromise the tight regulation of gene expression. Our findings have demonstrated that the THE inducible system is tightly regulated by doxycycline and exhibits significantly lower leakiness. This feature is particularly important for studies in which controlled expression of toxic genes, tumor suppressor genes, and apoptosis-inducing genes is desired. Moreover, the single vector system facilitates the establishment of inducible lines and minimizes the possible phenotypic aberrations caused by clonal variations. Thus, this inducible system should be highly valuable for a broad range of basic and clinical studies.

We purified, cloned, and functionally characterized inTrypanosoma brucei a new member of the C-terminal kinesin family, TbKIFC1. Kinetic constants of the recombinant motor domain of TbKIFC1 were estimated at 0.56 μmfor the microtubule dissociation constant (Kd) with a kcat of 0.2 s−1. Immunolocalization analysis showed an association ofTbKIFC1 with punctate structures. Because they were rapidly transported to the negative pole of the microtubule after NH4Cl treatment, these structures were considered to be associated with acidic vesicles. To determine the role of the kinesinin vivo, we produced an inducible kinesin-deficient strain by double-stranded RNA interference methodology. Mutant cells were loaded with the fluorescent reagent fura2/acetoxymethylester to measure intracellular free calcium ([Ca2+]i). The resting [Ca2+]i was unchanged in mutant cells; however, alkalinization of acidic vesicles induced by NH4Cl or nigericin was not followed by release of Ca2+. These data and the relative importance of the ionomycin-releasable and the ionomycin-plus-NH4Cl-releasable Ca2+ pools suggest a lower Ca2+ content in acidocalcisomes and dysfunctional Ca2+ release.

To survive and develop in the distinctive environment of the mammalian host and the insect vector, Trypanosoma brucei must undergo morphological, biochemical, and physiological changes to adapt to the different environmental conditions. Cell viability requires mechanisms to control pH and Ca2+ homeostasis (1Docampo R. Moreno S.N. Parasitol. Today. 1999; 15: 443-448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 2Fraser-L'Hostis C. Defrise-Quertain F. Coral D. Deshusses J. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1997; 378: 1039-1046PubMed Google Scholar). The level of endocytosis demonstrated by bloodstream forms (BF)1 is among the highest described so far for eukaryotic cells (3Overath P. Stierhof Y.-D. Wiese M. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 27-33Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Interestingly, this endocytic pathway is associated with an unusual cytoskeleton comprised of a precisely ordered subpellicular microtubule array that confers a high polarity to the cell, defined by a positive pole at its posterior end (4Gull K. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1999; 53: 629-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). The flagellum exits the cell from this positive pole at the flagellar pocket, a surface membrane invagination specialized for endocytosis and exocytosis (3Overath P. Stierhof Y.-D. Wiese M. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 27-33Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). These features make the trypanosome an interesting model for the study of vesicular biogenesis and communication. Kinesin proteins constitute a superfamily, the kinesin family proteins (KIFs), also known as kinesin-like proteins. Sequence differences between members of the family within the conserved motor domain of around 340 amino acids (5Goodson H.V. Kang S.J. Endow S.A. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 1875-1884Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) are used to classify the kinesin proteins into at least 10 families (tubulin.cb.m.u-tokyo.ac.jp/KIF/). Regions outside of the motor domain are family-specific and share little, if any, sequence homology. This diversity suggests that different kinesins have distinct roles in many different cellular processes including cell division, signal transduction, and microtubule dynamics (7Goldstein L.S. Philp A.V. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 141-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). They also participate in the trafficking of macromolecular complexes (8Sheetz M.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 262: 19-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and organelles including mitochondria (9Tanaka Y. Kanai Y. Okada Y. Nonaka S. Takeda S. Harada A. Hirokawa N. Cell. 1998; 93: 1147-1158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar), lysosomes (10Hollenbeck P.J. Swanson J.A. Nature. 1990; 346: 864-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 11Nakata T. Hirokawa N. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1039-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), and synaptic vesicles (12Hurd D.D. Stern M. Saxton W.M. Genetics. 1996; 142: 195-204Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These cargoes are moved along microtubules (13Hirokawa N. Noda Y. Okada Y. Curr. Opin. Cell. Biol. 1998; 10: 60-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar) by the action of the molecular motor domain. Kinesins are usually associated with plus-end transport, whereas minus end-directed membrane organelle transport is generally attributed to the dynein protein family (14Sloboda R.D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5447-5452Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). Because TbKIFC1 did not belong to any of the reported kinesin families with a known cellular function, we conducted a functional study designed to reveal the role of this kinesin inT. brucei and provide insight into the mode of action of C-terminal kinesins involved in minus end transport. The results from these approaches have shown the essential role of TbKIFC1 for the biogenesis of acidocalcisomes and Ca2+ homeostasis in T. brucei. T. brucei brucei monomorphic strain 427 from clone MITat 1.4 (15Cross G. Parasitology. 1975; 71: 393-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar, 16Holder A. Cross G. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1981; 2: 135-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) was used for protein purification and gene cloning. For the protein expression study procyclics derived from 427, the pleomorphic T. brucei GUTat 3.1 (17Pamer E.G. So M. Davis C.E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1989; 33: 27-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), andTrypanosoma congolense IL3000 clone 49 (provided by E. Authié) were used. The transgenic cell lines (gift from G.A.M. Cross) were created from a T. brucei 427 wild-type background (18Wirtz E. Hoek M. Cross G.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 4626-4634Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Procyclics were grown in SDM-79 (19Hamm B. Schindler A. Duszenko M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1990; 40: 13-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) with 10% calf serum at 27 °C. For IL3000 procyclic and epimastigote forms and for the isolation of metacyclic forms from epimastigote, cultures was performed as described (20Ross C.A. Acta Trop. 1987; 44: 293-301PubMed Google Scholar). Bloodstream slender forms were obtained from infected rats for MITat and infected mice for GUTat andT. congolense and from infected immunosuppressed mice for GUTat stumpy forms. These bloodstream forms were subsequently purified from blood cells by DEAE-cellulose chromatography (21Lanham S. Godfrey D. Exp. Parasitol. 1970; 28: 521-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (1124) Google Scholar). Bloodstream forms were also cultured in vitro in modified minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (22Baltz T. Baltz D. Giroud C. Crockett J. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 1273-1277Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). DEAE-Sepharose Fast flow (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was used for ion exchange chromatography.O-Phospho-l-tyrosine immobilized on cross-linked 4% beaded agarose from Sigma was used for affinity chromatography. The chromatographic system used throughout this study was the fast protein liquid chromatography work station from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. All buffers contained a protease inhibitor mixture with final concentrations of 1 μm chemostatin, 1 μmleupeptin, 1 μm pepstatin, and 10 μmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The fraction corresponding to soluble protein obtained by hypotonic lysis (23Seyfang A. Duszenko M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 214: 593-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) was equilibrated in buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 20 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitor mixture) and loaded onto the DEAE fast flow column from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech pre-equilibrated in buffer A. The column was then washed with buffer B, and the flow-through was collected. Elution was performed by the discontinuous step gradient method. Fractions were collected at 50 and 100% buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 500 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitor mixture). The 50% eluted DEAE fraction was diluted and equilibrated with pre-equilibration buffer A and adsorbed onto a buffer A pre-equilibrated O-phospho-l-tyrosine-agarose affinity column. The column was washed with buffer B, and the flow-through was collected. The enzyme was eluted by a discontinuous step gradient at 50 and 100% of buffer B in a total volume of 20 ml. The flow rate was 2 ml/min for each step. NterKIFC and MDKIFC (the recombinant proteins expressed in Escherichia coli) were purified from the Amersham Pharmacia BiotechHis·Bind® column, which was used according to the manufacturer's instructions (Novagen). Before performing the ATPase activity tests and the microtubule binding experiments, we desalted the MD-Kin recombinant purified protein in PEM buffer (200 mm Pipes/NaOH, pH 6.9, 2 mm EGTA, 2 mm MgSO4) on a PD10 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). A purification procedure was performed starting with 1.5 × 1011 bloodstream form trypanosomes. Gel slices for sequencing were obtained from Amido Black-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gels and sent for microsequencing to Dr. Dalayer (Laboratoire de Microsequençage des Proteines, Institut Pasteur, Paris, France) (24Rosenfeld J. Capdevielle J. Guillemot J.C. Ferrara P. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 203: 173-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (1132) Google Scholar). Total cell RNA and poly(A)+ RNA were prepared and purified according to Sambrook et al. (25Sambrook J. Fritsh E. Maniatis T. Ford N. Nolan C. Ferguson M. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). cDNA was obtained by random priming with hexanucleotides and reverse transcription with the Stratagene reverse transcriptase RT II. The 90P26AS (5′-TTYTGCCANCCDATNAC-3′) and 90P31AS (5′-TGYTGNGTNGCYTCYTG-3′) degenerate oligonucleotides were generated by the reverse translation of sequenced peptides, P26 (VIGWQK) and P31 (QEATQQ), respectively. A portion of the spliced leader sequence common to all T. brucei mRNAs (5′-ACAGTTTCTGTACTATATTG-3′) was also used as a 5′ primer (MEX2). The cDNA was then used as a template for PCR amplification using the primer associations MEX2/90P26AS and MEX2/90P31AS. The amplified fragments were gel-isolated, cloned into the pT7blue T-vector (Novagen), and sequenced. The amplified and cloned MEX2/90P26AS fragment was used as a probe to screen a T. brucei genomic DNA library (25Sambrook J. Fritsh E. Maniatis T. Ford N. Nolan C. Ferguson M. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) generated in the c2X75 cosmid vector (26Campbell D.A. NAR. 1989; 17: 458Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) as previously described (27Bates P. Swift R. Gene (Amst.). 1983; 26: 137-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar).BamHI/EcoRI fragments of the isolated 2.1 cosmid were subcloned into the pUC18 vector from Appligene and screened with the cDNA fragment MEX2/90P26AS. A BamHI/EcoRI fragment of 5,000 base pairs was isolated and sequenced using the AmpliTaq DNA polymerase, as described by the manufacturer (ABI PRISMTM; PerkinElmer Life Sciences). A 690-base pair fragment comprising the N-terminal region and a 1,550-base pair fragment containing the C terminus motor domain were generated by PCR. A 5-kilobase BamHI/EcoRI genomic fragment from AnTat 1 subcloned into pBlueScript (Stratagene) was used as a template for both PCR reactions. For the kinesin N-terminal construction (NterKIFC), the 5′ primer (5′-TGCAGACATATGTCTGCGGAACAACCC) contained a 12-nucleotide linker with an NdeI restriction site to facilitate subcloning and five adjacent N-terminal residues (SAEQP). The 3′ primer (5′-GCTTTCGGATCCTTAATGGTGATGGTGATGGTGGCACTTCATCTTGTGATT) included a 12-nucleotide linker with a BamHI site for cloning, a stop codon, codons for six histidine tag residues to allow binding to the His·Bind® column, and codons for six C-terminal residues (NHKMKC). The PCR product was inserted into the NdeI/BamHI sites of the pET3a plasmid (Novagen). The C-terminal region ofTbKIFC1 coding for the motor domain (MDKIFC) was obtained by using the 5′ primer (5′-GCTCAGGCTAGCCACCATCACCATCACCATCTGCGTAAGCAGTACTAC) and the 3′ primer (5′-TGGATTCGCGGCCGCTTAGCCAAGAGATACGCCACG). The PCR-amplified DNA fragment encoded a region between the amino acids Leu475 and Pro820 of TbKIFC1. This product was cloned between the NheI/NotI sites of the pET23a plasmid (Novagen). The resulting recombinant NterKIFC and MDKIFC proteins were expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) from Novagen according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cells were lysed in 1× binding buffer, containing the protease inhibitor mixture, by three steps of freezing and thawing and brief sonication. The lysate was centrifuged for 30 min at 10,000 ×g, and the resulting supernatant was applied to a Ni2+ His·Bind® column. DNA and amino acid sequences were analyzed by the DNA STRIDER software and data base searches by the BLAST algorithm. Multiple alignment of amino acid sequences and hamming distances were determined from the CLUSTAL W version 1.6 (28Thompson J. Higgins D. Gibson T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (56002) Google Scholar) and the phylogenetic tree constructed from version 3.5c of the PHYLIP program package of J. Felsenstein (BLAST, CLUSTAL W, and PHYLIP softwares were obtained through Bisance and Infobiogen facilities). The matrix of pairwise sequence distances were calculated by Dayhoff's method using PRODIST. The phylogenetic trees were constructed from the distance matrix by the Neighbor or Fitch methods and were rooted with the ScSmy1 sequence as an out-group (23Seyfang A. Duszenko M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 214: 593-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The phylogenetic tree was drawn with TREEVIEW version 1.3 (29Page R. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1996; 12: 357-358PubMed Google Scholar). The NterKIFC recombinant protein was purified by immobilized metal affinity chromatography and electroeluted from a 10% SDS-PAGE gel. A mouse was injected with 20 μg of the purified recombinant protein in complete Freund's adjuvant. A further two 20-μg samples in Freund's incomplete adjuvant were injected 15 and 30 days later. After 4 weeks, a fourth aliquot of 20 μg of protein was injected, and the hybridoma technique was begun 4 days later according to Ref. 30Fazekas de Siant Goth S. Heidegger D. J. Immunol. Methods. 1980; 35: 1-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (1172) Google Scholar. One hybridoma, H3, was selected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay screening against the recombinant NterKIFC protein. Antibodies were purified from the culture medium by a protein A affinity column according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For Western blot analysis, proteins in sample buffer (2.2% SDS, 50 mm DTT, 90 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, and 10% glycerol, mass/volume) were boiled for 5 min and subjected to 10% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (31Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). The proteins were then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (Immobilon P, Millipore) membranes by semi-dry blotting (32Kyshe-Andersen J. J Biochem. Biophys. Methods. 1984; 10: 203-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (2159) Google Scholar). Filters were blocked for 15 min with PBS-Tween-milk (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 4.3 mm Na2HPO4, 1.4 mmKH2PO4, 0,005% Tween 20, 5% milk), incubated overnight at 4 °C with a supernatant culture of the H3 hybridoma. A 1:1000 dilution in PBS-Tween-milk of goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Sanofi-Pasteur) was then added for 2 h. Immunoreactive bands were revealed by washing in 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 20 mm NaCl, and a solution containing 0.05% H2O2 and 2.8 mm4-chloro-1-naphthol or 3,3′-diaminobenzidine for the peroxidase conjugate and according to the manufacturer's instructions for ECL revelation (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Bloodstream and procyclic forms were fixed on ice for 15 min in 2% formaldehyde and permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100 for 10 min at room temperature. The formaldehyde was neutralized for 10 min with 0.1m glycine at room temperature. After centrifugation and resuspension in PBS, trypanosomes were transferred to a microscope slide and treated for 30 min at room temperature with either monoclonal antibodies or polyclonal serum diluted in PBS containing 0,1% bovine serum albumin. Secondary antibodies were conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate (Pasteur Sanofi), Alexa fluor 568 (Molecular Probes). After washing, slides containing the treated trypanosomes were mounted with anti-fade Vectashield (Vector Laboratories). The cells were examined on a Zeiss UV microscope, and the images were analyzed by the use of a camera (Photometrics) with Metaview software and Adobe Photoshop 5.1 (Adobe Systems). Acidic vesicle motility was measured according to the method of Heuser (33Heuser J. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 855-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Cultured bloodstream forms were washed three times in Ringer's solution (155 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 2 mm NaH2PO4, 10 mmHepes, pH 7.2, 10 mm glucose, and 0,5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in this buffer. For the nocodazole assay, the cells were preincubated 20 min at room temperature in Ringer's solution in presence of 10 μmnocodazole. To induce retrograde transport, NH4Cl (final concentration, 30 mm) was added to the previous buffer, and the cells were incubated for 15 min. The parasites were then either formaldehyde fixed, as described for the immunofluorescence assay, or washed three times in acetate-Ringer's solution (80 mmNaCl, 70 mm sodium acetate, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 2 mm Hepes/NaOH, pH 6.9, and 10 mm glucose), incubated for 15 min, and fixed. Protein concentrations were estimated by the method of Bradford (34Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217546) Google Scholar) and by Coomassie Blue staining after SDS-PAGE. Bovine serum albumin was used as a standard. For microtubule binding assays, the proteins were quantified by Western blotting. Gels and membranes were then scanned to produce digital images, and protein bands were quantified using NIH image. Bovine serum albumin and MDKIFC were used as standards. Bovine tubulin was kindly provided by B. Goud (Institut Curie Paris). After parasite lysis,T. brucei tubulin was purified by chromatography on DEAE Q fast flow (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and two cycles of polymerization (35Stieger J. Wyler T. Seebeck T. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 4596-4602Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36MacRae T.H. Gull K. Biochem. J. 1990; 265: 87-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). 100 μg of tubulin was polymerized in PEM buffer in the presence of glycerol 33% (v/v), 1 mm GTP, 1 mm MgCl2 for 10 min at 37 °C. Taxol was then added to a final concentration of 40 μm, and the polymerization continued for 30 min. Microtubules were centrifuged at 40,000 × g for 30 min at 22 °C. To eliminate protein aggregates, MDKIFC was centrifuged at 40,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Binding assays were performed by incubating MDKIFC protein (0.1–1.7 μm) with 1 μm microtubule in PEM buffer supplemented with 1 mm GTP, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm DTT, 20 μm taxol, and 2.5 mmATP for 15 min at room temperature. The supernatants and pellets were analyzed on SDS-PAGE and by Western blotting. ATPase activity was measured as described by Mitsui et al. (37Mitsui H. Nakatani K. Yamaguchi-Shinozaki K. Shinozaki K. Nishikawa K. Takahashi H. Plant Mol. Biol. 1994; 25: 865-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). 1 μg of MDKin protein was incubated for 5 min at 22 °C in 100 μl of PEM buffer containing 2 mm DTT, 1 mm GTP, 1 μm taxol. Then 1 mm(final concentration) of [γ-32P]ATP (0.55 × 108 cpm/μmol) was added, and the incubation continued for 15 min at 22 °C. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 1% final SDS, 100 μl of (5 m H2SO4, 10% ammonium molybdate, 0.1 m silicotungstic acid, in a volume ratio of 2:2:1) and 1 ml of xylene/isobutanol (65:35). The reaction mixture was vortexed for 15 s and centrifuged for 5 s at 5,000 × g. Released phosphate was measured by Cerenkov counting. The inductible T7 RNAP-based protein expression system developed by E. Wirtz was used in this study (18Wirtz E. Hoek M. Cross G.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 4626-4634Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The pLew 100 vector and the procyclic host cell line 29-13 coexpressing T7 RNAP and TetR were gifts from G. Cross. For double-stranded RNA expression the following construct was produced. DNA fragments corresponding to the coding regions of TbKIFC1 from nucleotides 1 to 694 and from nucleotides 1 to 645 were PCR-amplified. The 694-base pair fragment was amplified using the following set of primers: DB/KIN/01 (5′-GGCCGGAAGCTTATGTCTGCGGAACAACCC) and DB/KIN/02 (5′-GGCCGGGGATCCGCTTGAATTCGCTTTCATAGCTTCCTGA) and cloned between theBamHI/HindIII restriction sites of pLew100, giving the pLew100-SKIN construction. In a second step the 645-base pair fragment was cloned in the opposite orientation of the 694 fragment in the pLew100-SKIN construction between theEcoRI/BamHI restriction sites. This later fragment was obtained by PCR amplification using the following primers DB/KIN/03 (GGCCGGGAATTCATTCTTGCACTCCCTTGC) and DB/KIN/04 (GGCCGGGGATCCATGTCTGCGGAGCAACCC. A PCR DNA fragment containing the total TbKIFC1 coding region was also cloned into the pLew 100 vector between the HindIII/BamHI restriction sites. For stable transformation T. brucei procyclic forms (29-13 cell line) were harvested from a log phase culture (5 × 106 cells) and washed once in ZPFM (18Wirtz E. Hoek M. Cross G.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 4626-4634Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) and resuspended to a cell density of 4 × 107 cells/ml in ZPFM. 2 × 107 cells were electroporated with 10 μg of DNA in the Eurogentech Cellject machine at 1600 V, R infinite, 40 microfarad. Parasites were then transferred to SDM-79 medium containing 10 μg/ml G418 and 5 μg/ml hygromycin and cultured overnight before the addition of phleomycin 2.5 μg/ml. The [Ca2+]i and pHi were measured according to Scott et al. (38Scott D.A. Moreno S.N. Docampo R. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 789-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and Fraser-L'Hostis et al. (2Fraser-L'Hostis C. Defrise-Quertain F. Coral D. Deshusses J. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1997; 378: 1039-1046PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were loaded with either fura2/AM or BCECF/AM (Molecular Probes) and resuspended in buffer A containing 116 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 0.8 mmMgSO4, 5.5 mm glucose, 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, and 1 mm EGTA for [Ca2+]idetermination. The fura2 fluorescence response to the [Ca2+]i was calibrated from the ratio 330/380 nm fluorescence values for an emission at 510 nm. For pHi we used the wavelengths 490 and 440 nm for excitation and 535 nm for emission. The spectrofluorometer fluoromax (SPEX Instruments) and software DM 3000 (SPEX Instruments) were used for data analysis. We previously described a two-step chromatographic process for the purification of a plasma membrane phosphatase (39Bakalara N. Santarelli X. Davis C. Baltz T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8863-8871Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) and used this procedure to purify soluble phosphatase. After hypotonic lysis, the soluble fraction was applied to a DEAE fast flow column at pH 7. VSG, the most abundant protein, was removed in the flow-through, and phosphatase activity was collected in the 250 mm NaCl eluate fraction (data not shown). Purification of the DEAE-eluted fraction proteins on an O-phospho-l-tyrosine affinity column led to the partial purification of a 91-kDa protein (Fig. 1A) that eluted at 150 mm NaCl. Although only a minority of the phosphatase activity was present in that fraction (40Bakalara N. Seyfang A. Davis C. Baltz T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 234: 871-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), the 91-kDa polypeptide was microsequenced after isolation from a 10% reducing SDS-PAGE. Three peptide sequences were obtained: 1) IISTVIGWQK; 2) ESAYYSSQLTSAIASIAAAA; and 3) NAQQVMLQAQEATQQ (Fig. 1B). Oligonucleotides based on these sequences were used to identify genomic fragments corresponding to the gene, and after screening of a T. brucei cosmid library, the complete gene sequence of the 91-kDa protein (AF319546) was obtained. The single copy gene (Southern blot; data not shown) encoded a protein of 841 amino acids. The gene was entitled TbKIFC1. Its C-terminal domain (367 amino acids) was more than 60% similar to the motor domain of kinesin (tubulin.cb.m.u-tokyo.ac.jp/KIF/). The N-terminal region did not reveal overt similarity to known kinesins or other proteins in the data base; however, analysis of its composition revealed a potential globular head domain, a coiled-coil stalk domain typical of those conserved among most kinesins and the kinesin neck consensus sequence (Fig. 1B). Molecular phylogenetic analysis, supported by high bootstrap values (Fig. 1C), showed thatTbKIFC1 diverged from the four originally described C-terminal kinesin classes. Specific functions or particular cargoes have been identified for class I, II, and III C-terminal kinesins (tubulin.cb.m.u-tokyo.ac.jp/KIF/), but our phylogenetic analysis suggests a different cellular function forTbKIFC1. To determine whetherTbKIFC1 belongs to the motor protein family, we tested the recombinant C-terminal domain MDKIFC1 (Fig. 1B) (41Chandra R. Endow S.A. Salmon E.D. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 104: 899-906PubMed Google Scholar) for a variety of biochemical functions. The His6-tagged recombinant protein was purified by an immobilized metal affinity chromatography procedure. The Km value for ATP was determined as 51 μm. The dissociation constant (Kd) from microtubules in the presence of ATP was calculated by incubating different concentrations of MDKIFC1 with 2 μm microtubules and quantitating the amount of microtubule-bound motor domain (Fig.2A). The dissociation constant of MDKIFC1 from microtubules was determined to be 0.56 μm. Microtubules (2.5 μm) stimulated MDKIFC1 ATPase activity by about 8-fold to 2 pmol/s/μg of protein (Fig. 2B). The kinetic parameters,kcat, the steady state turnover number, and theK0.5MT, corresponding to the concentration of microtubules required for half-maximal stimulation of the ATPase activity, were estimated respectively at 0.1 s−1 and 0.7 μm, respectively (Fig. 2B). Relative expression level quantification ofTbKIFC1 between the mammalian host BF and the insect procyclic form of the parasite was estimated by immunoblotting with a specific monoclonal antibody (H3) directed against the N-terminal domain (amino acids 1–231). Expression in bloodstream forms was 1000-fold greater than in procyclics (Fig.3A). Furthermore Fig.3B shows that TbKIFC1 was also expressed at similar levels in the nondividing metacyclic insect form and the dividing slender trypomastigote form and that stumpies did not express the protein. The results suggested that the function ofTbKIFC1 was related to the adaptation of the parasite to its mammalian host. The nature of the specific cargo to which TbKIFC1 associates was also investigated. Immunolocalization in slender bloodstream form trypanosomes using the monoclonal antibody H3 revealed thatTbKIFC1 was confined to punctate structures. The higher density of these structures around the nucleus of the parasite (Fig.4, a and b) suggests an association with a perinuclear acidic compartment (42Brickman M.J. Cook J.M. Balber A.E. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 3611-3621Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Lysosomes and acidic ve"

In this paper, we report the expression in insect cells of full-length, fully regulatedAcanthamoeba MIHCK and further characterize the regulation of this PAK by Rac, calmodulin, and autoinhibition. We map the autoinhibitory region of MIHCK to its PAN region and show that the PAN region inhibits autophosphorylation and kinase activity of unphosphorylated full-length MIHCK and its expressed catalytic domain but has very little effect on either when they are phosphorylated. These properties are similar to those reported for mammalian PAK1. Unlike PAK1, MIHCK is activated by Rac only in the presence of phospholipid. However, peptides containing the PAN region of MIHCK bind Rac in the absence of lipid, and Rac binding reverses the inhibition of the MIHCK catalytic domain by PAN peptides.

Cell. 2000; 102: 387-397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar), the ∼80-residue autoregulatory region of mammalian PAK1 consists of an N-terminal p21-binding domain (PBD) of ∼44 residues, an overlapping inhibitory switch (IS) domain of ∼50 residues that includes the C-terminal ∼27 residues of the PBD and a C-terminal ∼14-residue kinase inhibitory domain. A CRIB (Cdc42/Rac interactive binding) motif (15Burbelo P.D. Drechsel D. Hall A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29071-29074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar) of ∼16 residues near the N terminus of the autoregulatory region is an essential component of the PBD. PAK4 (16Abo A. Qu J. Cammarano M.S. Dan C. Fritsch A. Baud V. Belisle B. Minden A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6527-6540Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar) and other PAK-II family members also have a C-terminal catalytic domain and an N-terminal PBD but lack a recognizable autoinhibitory domain (4Dan I. Watanabe N.M. Kusumi A. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 220-230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). Acanthamoeba MIHCK has a C-terminal catalytic domain, a region of sequence homology to the PAK1 PBD, including the CRIB motif, and an IS domain, but MIHCK does not have a region with sequence homology to the kinase inhibitory domain of PAK1. Therefore, by sequence alone it is difficult to determine whether MIHCK more closely resembles the PAK-I or PAK-II family. Following the region of homology with PAK1, the MIHCK sequence becomes extremely Pro-rich. We will use the terms PAN or putative autoregulatory region when referring to the segment of MIHCK that starts with the CRIB motif and ends just before the Pro-rich region. The C-terminal catalytic domain and the N-terminal PAN ofAcanthamoeba MIHCK have relatively low sequence homology to most PAKs (3Brzeska H. Young R. Knaus U. Korn E.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 394-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), and the remainder of the Acanthamoeba MIHCK sequence has no homology to either mammalian PAKs orDictyostelium MIHCK, which is also a PAK (17Lee S.-F. Egelhoff T.T. Mahasneh A. Côté G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27044-27048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). However, the substrate specificities and regulation of the activities of PAK1, the best characterized mammalian PAK, and the two MIHCKs are surprisingly similar but with interesting differences (18Brzeska H.

For example, although all three kinases are activated in vitro by autophosphorylation, Rac or lipids are required for autophosphorylation of PAK1 (20Manser E. Leung T. Salihuddin H. Zhao Z.-S. Lim L. Nature. 1994; 367: 40-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (1300) Google Scholar, 21Bokoch G.M. Reilly A.M. Daniels R.H. King C.C. Olivera A. Spiegel S. Knaus U.G. J. Biol.

Also, the lipids that activate mammalian PAK1 (21Bokoch G.M. Reilly A.M. Daniels R.H. King C.C. Olivera A. Spiegel S. Knaus U.G. J. Biol.

Thus, although the sequence homology between the two MIHCKs is no greater than the sequence homology between either MIHCK and PAK1, there are more common elements in the regulation of the activity of the two MIHCKs, i.e. the biochemical properties of at least these three PAKs are not easily predictable from their protein sequences. Therefore, it is important to identify the elements of the primary structure that are responsible for the particular properties of each member of the PAK family. In this paper we further characterize some aspects of the regulation of the activity of Acanthamoeba MIHCK using fully regulated, full-length kinase and its catalytic domain expressed in insect cells and Escherichia coli-expressed kinase peptides corresponding to regions outside of the catalytic domain. We show that Rac-induced activity of Acanthamoeba MIHCK is inhibited by Ca2+-calmodulin, as shown previously for lipid-induced activity (25Brzeska H. Kulesza-Lipka D. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23870-23875Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and localize the calmodulin-binding region to a segment N-terminal to PAN. We show also that the putative autoregulatory region inhibits the activity of unphosphorylated full-length Acanthamoeba MIHCK and its catalytic domain and that residues N-terminal to PAN are required for optimal binding of Rac. To construct a full-length cDNA clone, clones 43 (which lacks 23 bp at the 5′ end) and 45 (which has a 3-bp deletion, bp 613–615) (3Brzeska H. Young R. Knaus U. Korn E.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 394-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) were digested with KpnI and XmnI; the large digestion fragment of clone 45 (4.8 kb) was ligated to the small fragment of clone 43 (2 kb) producing plasmid pCB1 containing the complete sequence of MIHCK in pBK-CMV vector. For ease of cloning into several E. coliexpression vectors, plasmid pCB1 was than digested with NdeI and KpnI and subcloned into pET30a digested with the same enzymes producing pCB2 with several unique restriction sites after the stop codon. The NdeI/HindIII fragment of pCB2, containing the MIHCK gene, was then subcloned intoNdeI/HindIII-digested pET23a, which contains an f1 origin of replication, allowing production of single-stranded DNA for mutagenesis and a T7 promoter for E. coli expression. Site-specific mutagenesis using the Kunkel method (26Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4900) Google Scholar) and primer 5′-TAT TCT CCA TAT GTC TAA TTC A-3′ was performed to introduce anNdeI site at the initiator ATG. The resulting plasmid (pCB4), containing two NdeI sites about 700 bp apart, was digested with NdeI and the 6.2-kb fragment ligated to itself to give pCB6 with one NdeI site at the initiator methionine. pCB6 was used for protein expression in E. coli, and the MIHCK gene from pCB6 was subcloned into a variety of E. coliexpression vectors, including ones with T7lac and PLpromoters. PCB6, whose backbone is pET23a, has a unique HindIII site 25 bp before the fusion sequence of a polyhistidine tag. The MIHCK stop codon in pCB6 was mutated to a HindIII site using 5′-AAG GAA GGA AAA GCT TGA AGA ACA TC-3′ as primer. The resulting plasmid (which has twoHindIII sites) was digested with HindIII and the largest fragment, which contained the MIHCK gene, was ligated to itself (pCB14). The expressed protein will have 13 extra amino acids (KLAAALEHHHHHH) at the C terminus. pCB14 was digested withNdeI and BlpI and filled-in using the Klenow procedure according to the manufacturer's suggestion (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The fragment that contained the gene was subcloned into pBlueBac 4.5 (Invitrogen Corp., Carlsbad, CA), which was digested withSacI and filled-in by the Klenow (26Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4900) Google Scholar) procedure. The resulting plasmid, pCB15, was transfected to SF9 cells using the Bac-N-Blue transfection kit (Invitrogen). Plaque assay was done on the P0 stock, and 24 different plaques were shown by PCR to contain the recombinant viral DNA. One of the plaques was amplified (P2-stock) to a volume of 300 ml. SF9 cells in suspension culture (100 ml, cell density of 2 × 106 cells/ml) were infected with 1.5 ml of P2-stock and harvested after 3 days by centrifugation at 1,500 rpm in a Sorvall SS-34 rotor for 15 min. The cell pellet was washed once with ice-cold binding buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.9, 500 mmNaCl, 10 mm imidazole) and centrifuged at 1,500 rpm in a Sorvall SS-34 rotor for 10–15 min. The cells were then resuspended in 4 ml of binding buffer containing protease inhibitors (0.25 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml pepstatin, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol), homogenized with 20–24 strokes in a Dounce homogenizer, and spun at 15,000 rpm in Sorvall SS-34 rotor for 10–20 min. The supernatant was loaded onto an 0.5-ml Ni-NTA (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) column equilibrated with binding buffer containing 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and the column was washed with 20 column volumes of binding buffer containing 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol and eluted with elution buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.9, 500 mm NaCl, 80 mmimidazole, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol). Fractions containing MIHCK were pooled and dialyzed against kinase storage buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm2-mercaptoethanol, 50% glycerol, 0.01% NaN3). The yield varied between 0.4 and 0.6 mg of MIHCK/100 ml of culture. The catalytic domain was expressed in SF9 cells and purified as described previously (27Brzeska H. Szczepanowska J. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27056-27062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Incubation of full-length kinase and the catalytic domain with type III acid phosphatase was as described previously (28Szczepanowska J. Zhang X. Herring C.J. Qin J. Korn E.D. Brzeska H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8503-8508Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Before treatment with λ-phosphatase, 0.1–0.5 mg of MIHCK eluted from Ni-NTA column was dialyzed against 50 mmTris, pH 7.5, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 50 mmKCl. After dialysis MnCl2, to final concentration 2 mm, and 2–10 μl of λ-phosphatase (catalog number: 753S, New England Biolabs Inc., Beverley, MA) were added, and the reaction was allowed to proceed for 30 min at 30 °C. Alternatively, kinase in storage buffer was diluted twice with 80 mm Tris, pH 7.5, and phosphatase and MnCl2 were added as above. Neither longer incubation times (up to 2 h) nor higher phosphatase concentrations resulted in further dephosphorylation (as judged by kinase activity). Kinase was separated from phosphatase by chromatography on a Ni-NTA column. The same procedures were used for dephosphorylating the expressed catalytic domain. For complete phosphorylation (and, thus, complete activation) full-length kinase (50–100 μg/ml) and catalytic domain (40 μg/ml) were incubated at 30 °C in the activity assay buffer (minus PC9) for 60 and 30 min, respectively. DNAs for expression of MIHCK peptides (see Fig. 1) were produced by PCR using full-length MIHCK cDNA as template. All of the cDNAs, except N4 cDNA, had 5′-HindIII and 3′-BglII sites introduced during PCR and were cloned between these sites into pRESET B vector (Invitrogen) creating an N-terminal poly-His-tag in the expressed peptides. N4 cDNA had 5′-BglII and 3′-HindIII sites introduced during PCR and was cloned between these sites into pFLAG-2 vector (Sigma) resulting in an N-terminal FLAG sequence in the expressed N4 peptide. Expression of these cDNAs in BL-21(DE3) cells was induced with isopropylthio-β-d-galactoside. The peptides, except N4, were purified on Ni-NTA columns as described for purification of full-length kinase. The two proline-rich fragments (M1 and M2) were additionally purified by diluting Ni-NTA column eluates with 40 mm Tris, pH 7.9, to lower the NaCl concentration to 25 mm, and loading them onto S-support cation exchange columns (Bio-Rad) and eluting with an 0.05–1 m KCl gradient in 40 mm Tris, pH 7.9. N4 was purified on a FLAG-affinity column according to the manufacturer's (Sigma) protocol. Bacterial extract containing N4 in FLAG-column buffer (containing the same protease inhibitors as for MIHCK extracts) was loaded onto a FLAG-affinity column equilibrated with 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 200 mm KCl, 1% Triton. The column was washed with the same buffer, and M1 and M2 peptides were eluted with the same buffer containing 0.1 mg/ml of FLAG peptide. All peptides except N1 and N2 were dialyzed against kinase storage buffer and stored at −20 °C. N1 and N2 (which precipitated in low salt buffers) were dialyzed against 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 300 mm KCl and frozen in small aliquots at −70 °C. Unless otherwise stated, kinase activity was assayed as described previously (24Brzeska H. Lynch T.J. Martin B.M. Corigliano-Murphy A. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16138-16144Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using synthetic peptide PC9 (200 μm), which corresponds to the phosphorylation site ofAcanthamoeba myosin IC (29Brzeska H. Lynch T.J. Martin B.M. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19340-19348Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), as substrate at 20 °C in activity buffer containing 50 mm imidazole, pH 7.0, 2.5 mm [γ-32P]ATP (30,000 cpm/nmol), 3.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mm EGTA. Dephosphorylated MIHCK (1.3–3 μg/ml) and catalytic domain (1.1 μg/ml) were incubated for 6–10 min when determining the inhibitory properties of kinase peptides and for 10–120 s when characterizing the properties of the expressed enzyme (the basal activity of MIHCK increases with a time of assay, because kinase autophosphorylates during assay (22Brzeska H. Lynch T.J. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3591-3594Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Brzeska H. Lynch T.J. Martin B.M. Corigliano-Murphy A. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16138-16144Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). Phosphorylated kinase (1.3–3 μg/ml) and catalytic domain (1.1 μg/ml) were incubated for 1–3 min. To assay calmodulin binding, peptides were incubated at room temperature with calmodulin covalently bound to agarose beads in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 60 mm KCl, 25% glycerol, 0.4 mg/ml bovine serum albumin in the presence of 1 mmCaCl2 or 5 mm EGTA. Samples were pelleted and pellets were washed three times with buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 200 mm KCl, and 1 mm CaCl2 or 5 mm EGTA, resuspended in SDS sample buffer, and equivalent volumes of original supernatants and washed pellets were run and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. All restriction enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs, Inc. The pET vectors, DNA ligation kit, and competent cells were from Novagen, Inc. (Madison, WI). The pLEX expression system was from Invitrogen. M13KO7 phage and CJ 236 for mutagenesis were from New England Biolabs. The Phagemid site-specific mutagenesis kit was purchased from Bio-Rad. All materials for insect cell expression were from Invitrogen. Bovine calmodulin and calmodulin-agarose were from Calbiochem. Human GST-Rac1 was expressed in E. coli and purified on glutathione-agarose. Nucleotide exchange for Rac was performed as described previously (3Brzeska H. Young R. Knaus U. Korn E.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 394-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford assay, and molecular weights calculated from protein sequences were used for calculating molar concentrations. Protein sequence analyses were performed using gcg and Expasy analysis tools. All attempts to express full-length kinase in E. coli using different plasmids and different bacterial cell lines were unsuccessful with only very little or no protein expressed. However, MIHCK was readily expressed in and purified from SF9 insect cells by the procedures described under “Experimental Procedures.” Purified MIHCK was partially, and variably, active, and activity was substantially reduced by treatment with phosphatase (indicating that the expressed enzyme was partially phosphorylated) and fully activated by subsequent autophosphorylation (Table IA). As with native MIHCK purified from Acanthamoeba, activation of the expressed kinase was accelerated by addition of phosphatidylserine to the assay mixture (Table IB) and Ca2+-calmodulin inhibited the phosphatidylserine stimulation (Table IC). Ca2+-calmodulin does not directly affect the activity of Acanthamoeba MIHCK but, rather, inhibits lipid-stimulated activity by competing with lipid binding (25Brzeska H. Kulesza-Lipka D. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23870-23875Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Also, and in contrast to mammalian PAKs, activation ofAcanthamoeba MIHCK by Rac occurs only in the presence of lipids (3Brzeska H. Young R. Knaus U. Korn E.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 394-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Calmodulin, in a Ca2+-dependent manner, also inhibited phosphatidylserine-dependent Rac activation of MIHCK (Table IC), presumably by inhibiting lipid binding that is required for Rac activation. To our knowledge,Acanthamoeba MIHCK is the first member of the PAK family to be expressed on a preparative scale as a fully regulated enzyme with properties indistinguishable from those of the native enzyme.Table ICharacterization of the activity of expressed Acanthamoeba myosin I heavy chain kinasePretreatment of kinaseAddition to assayActivityμmol/min·mgA.

We had shown previously that Acanthamoeba MIHCK is activated by proteolytic removal of N-terminal segments (30Brzeska H. Martin B.M. Kulesza-Lipka D. Baines I.C. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4949-4956Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Brzeska H. Martin B.M. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27049-27055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). This, and the sequence homology between MIHCK residues 93–148 and the autoregulatory region of mammalian PAKs, suggested that the PAN region of MIHCK might be responsible for autoinhibition and Rac binding. We had also shown (25Brzeska H. Kulesza-Lipka D. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23870-23875Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,30Brzeska H. Martin B.M. Kulesza-Lipka D. Baines I.C. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4949-4956Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that neither calmodulin nor phosphatidylserine bind to the C-terminal 90-kDa proteolytic fragment of MIHCK, residues 101–753 (3Brzeska H. Young R. Knaus U. Korn E.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 394-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). This, and the fact that basic α-helical regions are typically the site of Ca2+-dependent calmodulin binding in other proteins (32Zhang M. Yuan T. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 76: 313-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), made the basic region, residues 53–71, of MIHCK a good candidate for the calmodulin-binding site. For these reasons, we expressed the following peptides (Fig. 1): N1, residues 1–157, which begins at the N terminus and extends through the basic region and includes the entire putative PAN autoregulatory region; N2, residues 51–157, which is 50 residues shorter than N1 but still contains the basic region and putative autoregulatory region; and N3, residues 91–157, which is limited to the putative autoregulatory region. The middle of Acanthamoeba MIHCK, residues 149–151, is Pro-rich (37%) and basic (pI = 12.1). Although similar regions occur in other proteins, for example, tyrosine kinase ACK1 (33Manser E. Leung T. Salihuddin H. Tan L. Lim L. Nature. 1993; 363: 364-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar) and WASP-interacting protein (WIP) (34Ramesh N. Anton I.M. Hartwig J.H. Geha R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14671-14676Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar), they are absent from other PAKs, and it was of interest to determine whether this region was directly involved in autoregulation of MIHCK. Therefore, we also expressed (Fig. 1): peptides N4, residues 1–198, which includes the entire basic region and the putative PAN autoregulatory region and extends into the Pro-rich region; M1, residues 198–459, which contains just the Pro-rich region not included in N4; and M2, residues 80–459, which includes the putative autoregulatory region and the entire Pro-rich region but not the basic region. Peptides N1 and N2 bound to calmodulin-agarose beads in the presence of Ca2+ but M2 did not (Fig. 2), demonstrating that residues 51–80, the basic region that precedes the PAN region (Fig. 1), are essential for calmodulin binding. The sequence of this region predicts an α-helical structure in agreement with the secondary structure of other known Ca2+-dependent binding sites and different from the structure of Ca2+-independent binding sites (for reviews, see Refs. 32Zhang M. Yuan T. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 76: 313-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar and 35Rhoads A.R. Friedberg F. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 331-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar). In contrast to mammalian PAKs, full-length Acanthamoeba MIHCK has significant activity without addition of Rac. Therefore, inhibition of MIHCK by peptides can be assayed in the absence of Rac, thus avoiding the possibility that any inhibition might be due simply to sequestering of Rac by the peptides. Peptides N1, N2, N3, and M2 but not M1 inhibited the activity of full-length dephosphorylated MIHCK (Fig. 3 A). N3 was a more effective inhibitor than either N1, N2, or M2, suggesting that residues N- and C-terminal to the autoregulatory region do not contribute to inhibition (Fig. 1). Similarly, N3 was a more effective inhibitor of the expressed MIHCK catalytic domain than either N1 or N2 (M2 was equivalent to N3) (Fig. 3 B), confirming that residues 1–80, which contain the calmodulin/lipid-binding site, do not contribute to inhibition and may slightly weaken inhibition, by the autoregulatory domain, possibly by partially blocking the inhibitory region. Furthermore, the concentrations of N3 required for 50% inhibition of full-length MIHCK and the catalytic domain were similar, 50–100 nm (Fig.A and B), indicating that the inhibitory peptides do not interact with any sites in MIHCK outside of the catalytic domain. The concentration of N3 that inhibited MIHCK was significantly lower than the concentration of a corresponding peptide required for 50% inhibition of PAK1, 1,200 nm (14Zenke F.T. King C.C. Bohl B.P. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32565-32573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Prior autophosphorylation of full-length MIHCK and the catalytic domain greatly reduced the ability of the peptides to inhibit their activity (Fig. 3 C), suggesting that the peptides inhibit MIHCK kinase activity by inhibiting autophosphorylation. In agreement with this supposition, N1, N2 and M2 substantially inhibited autophosphorylation of full-length kinase (Fig. 4) under the same conditions in which they inhibited kinase activity. Similar results were reported for peptide inhibition of PAK1 (14Zenke F.T. King C.C. Bohl B.P. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32565-32573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Because the activity of the MIHCK catalytic domain is unaffected by Rac, reversal by Rac of the inhibition of catalytic domain activity by the inhibitory peptides can be used to determine the affinity of Rac for those peptides. Because their inhibitory potency differs, different concentrations of peptides were used in the experiment described in Fig. 5 so that inhibition, in the absence of Rac, was within the range of 30–50%. Rac (1.46 μm) almost completely reversed the inhibition of catalytic domain activity by N4 (0.3 μm) and N1 (0.88 μm) but reversed only slightly inhibition by N3 (0.16 μm) and M2 (0.5 μm) (Fig. 5), indicating that Rac has a higher affinity for N1 and N4 than for N3 and M2. This suggests (Fig. 1) that residues in the region N-terminal to the CRIB motif are required for effective Rac binding but that residues C-terminal to PAN are not required. Also, binding of Rac to N1 and N4 does not require lipids, which were not present in these assays. We have shown that, despite their significant sequence differences, the mechanism of regulation of AcanthamoebaMIHCK and mammalian PAK1 are quite similar and, in this respect as well as by sequence, MIHCK more closely resembles the mammalian PAK-I family than the PAK-II family; more specifically, MIHCK has an autoinhibitory domain. The PAN region of MIHCK (residues 92–157) is sufficient for inhibition of the activity of full-length MIHCK and the catalytic domain, and inhibition is abolished by autophosphorylation just as for PAK1 (10Zhao Z.-S. Manser E. Chen X.-Q. Chong C. Leung T. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 1: 2153-2163Crossref Google Scholar, 14Zenke F.T. King C.C. Bohl B.P. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol.

Cell. 2000; 102: 387-397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar) (see Hoffman et al.(36Hoffman G.R. Cerione R.A. Cell. 2000; 102: 403-406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) for commentary) recently reported the crystal structure of a complex between peptides corresponding to the catalytic domain and the autoregulatory region of PAK1 and identified the residues of the autoregulatory region that interact directly with the catalytic domain: Phe96, Leu106, Leu107, Ile112, Leu128, and Lys141 (Fig. 6). Mutations in Leu107, Glu110, and Asp126 result in constitutively active kinase. Phe96 to Ile112 lie within the PBD, Glu116, Asp126, and Leu128 are C-terminal to the PBD in the IS domain, as defined by Lei et al. (9Lei M. Lu W. Meng W. Parrini M.C. Eck M.J. Mayer B.J. Harrison S.C. Cell. 2000; 102: 387-397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar), and Lys141 is in the kinase inhibitory domain. Acanthamoeba MIHCK has identical residues in positions corresponding to Phe96, Leu107, and Glu116 of PAK1 and conserved substitutions Met, Leu, Glu, and Met at positions corresponding to positions 106, 112, 116, and 128, respectively, of PAK1 (Fig. 6). However, MIHCK has a Pro at the position that corresponds to Lys141 of PAK1. As Lys141 in PAK1 interacts with the activating loop of the catalytic domain and blocks the active site (9Lei M. Lu W. Meng W. Parrini M.C. Eck M.J. Mayer B.J. Harrison S.C. Cell. 2000; 102: 387-397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar), the absence of this residue in MIHCK may be related to the “looser” autoinhibition of MIHCK, i.e. Acanthamoeba MIHCK can be fully autophosphorylated and fully activated in the complete absence of both Rac and lipids. It is likely that no other residue in MIHCK fulfills the role of Lys141 in PAK1, since M2 peptide, which contains the 310 amino acids C-terminal to the autoinhibitory region of MIHCK, inhibits MIHCK activity no more than N3 (Figs. 1 and6). Residues important for interaction of the PBD region of mammalian PAKs with small GTP-binding proteins were recently identified by nuclear magnetic resonance (37Morreale A. Venkatesan M. Mott H.R. Owen D. Nietlispach D. Lowe P.N. Laue E.D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 384-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 38Gizachew D. Guo W. Chohan K.K. Sutcliffe M.J. Oswald R.E. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 3963-3971Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar): Ile75, Ser76, Pro78, Phe81, His83, His86, Met99, Trp103, Leu106, and Leu107 (37. Most of these amino acids also occur at the corresponding positions inAcanthamoeba MIHCK (Fig. 6), but the generally highly conserved His83 of PAK1 is replaced by Arg101in MIHCK, and Met99 and Leu106 of PAK1 are replaced by Leu117 and Met124 in MIHCK. Possibly these differences account for the fact that the region that includes basic residues N-terminal to the autoregulatory domain of MIHCK increases the affinity of the autoregulatory region to Rac (Fig. 5); however, Lys residues N-terminal to the CRIB motif have also been shown to enhance Rac binding to and activation of PAK1(39). Both Acanthamoeba (25Brzeska H. Kulesza-Lipka D. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23870-23875Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Dictyostelium (23Lee S.-F. Mahasneh A. DeLaRoche M. Côté G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27911-27917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) MIHCK bind Ca2+-calmodulin, which inhibits lipid-stimulated activation of both kinases. However, in contrast toAcanthamoeba MIHCK (this paper), Ca2+-calmodulin does not inhibit Rac-stimulated activation of DictyosteliumMIHCK (23Lee S.-F. Mahasneh A. DeLaRoche M. Côté G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27911-27917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The probable explanation of this difference is that, unlikeAcanthamoeba MIHCK, Rac activation ofDictyostelium MIHCK does not require lipids, and calmodulin inhibits Acanthamoeba MIHCK by competing with lipid binding. Basic regions immediately N-terminal to the CRIB motif similar to that which is required for calmodulin to bind to AcanthamoebaMIHCK occur not only in Dictyostelium MIHCK but also in other members of the PAK family such as Ste20. Therefore, it would be of interest to test the effect of calmodulin on their activities."
https://openalex.org/W2089078625,"Abstract The bgl sensory system is composed of a membrane-bound sugar sensor, BglF, and a transcriptional regulator, BglG. The sensor BglF has several enzymatic activities: in its nonstimulated state, it acts as BglG phosphorylase; in the presence of β-glucoside in the growth medium, it acts as BglG dephosphorylase and as the β-glucoside phosphotransferase. The same active site on BglF, Cys-24, is responsible for the phosphorylation of both the stimulating sugar and the BglG protein. BglF is composed of three domains, two hydrophilic and one hydrophobic. Our previous results suggested that catalysis of the sugar-stimulated functions depends on specific interactions between the B domain, which contains the active site cysteine, and the integral membrane C domain. We report here that the stimulating sugar triggers the formation of a disulfide bond between the active site cysteine and another cysteine in the membrane-embedded domain of BglF. Inability of a mutant BglF protein to form the disulfide bridge between the B and C domains correlates with its inability to catalyze the sugar-stimulated functions. The ability of the cysteine residue in BglF to bind covalently either to a phosphoryl group or to another cysteine residue, depending on the protein stimulation state, suggests a novel way to control signaling by alternative bond formation."
