https://openalex.org/W2049279804,"Little is known about metabolic regulation in stem cells and how this modulates tissue regeneration or tumour suppression. We studied the Lkb1 tumour suppressor and its substrate AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), kinases that coordinate metabolism with cell growth. Deletion of the Lkb1 (also called Stk11) gene in mice caused increased haematopoietic stem cell (HSC) division, rapid HSC depletion and pancytopenia. HSCs depended more acutely on Lkb1 for cell-cycle regulation and survival than many other haematopoietic cells. HSC depletion did not depend on mTOR activation or oxidative stress. Lkb1-deficient HSCs, but not myeloid progenitors, had reduced mitochondrial membrane potential and ATP levels. HSCs deficient for two catalytic α-subunits of AMPK (AMPK-deficient HSCs) showed similar changes in mitochondrial function but remained able to reconstitute irradiated mice. Lkb1-deficient HSCs, but not AMPK-deficient HSCs, exhibited defects in centrosomes and mitotic spindles in culture, and became aneuploid. Lkb1 is therefore required for HSC maintenance through AMPK-dependent and AMPK-independent mechanisms, revealing differences in metabolic and cell-cycle regulation between HSCs and some other haematopoietic progenitors. Haematopoietic stem cells are very sensitive to energetic and oxidative stress, and modulation of the balance between their quiescence and proliferation is needed to respond to metabolic stress while preserving their long-term regenerative capacity. Three new studies show that the tumour suppressor and metabolic sensor Lkb1 has a crucial role in maintaining energy homeostasis in haematopoietic cells. Lkb1 is shown to be necessary for cell-cycle regulation as well as for energy homeostasis, and haematopoietic stem cells depend more acutely on Lkb1 than any other haematopoietic cells. Haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are very sensitive to energetic and oxidative stress, and modulation of the balance between their quiescence and proliferation is needed to respond to metabolic stress while preserving HSCs' long-term regenerative capacity. Here the tumour suppressor Lkb1 is shown to promote stem-cell maintenance and tissue regeneration by regulating energy metabolism and by preventing aneuploidy."
https://openalex.org/W2013949855,"The stellar initial mass function (IMF) describes the mass distribution of stars at the time of their formation and is of fundamental importance for many areas of astrophysics. The IMF is reasonably well constrained in the disk of the Milky Way but we have very little direct information on the form of the IMF in other galaxies and at earlier cosmic epochs. Here we investigate the stellar mass function in elliptical galaxies by measuring the strength of the Na I doublet and the Wing-Ford molecular FeH band in their spectra. These lines are strong in stars with masses <0.3 Msun and weak or absent in all other types of stars. We unambiguously detect both signatures, consistent with previous studies that were based on data of lower signal-to-noise ratio. The direct detection of the light of low mass stars implies that they are very abundant in elliptical galaxies, making up >80% of the total number of stars and contributing >60% of the total stellar mass. We infer that the IMF in massive star-forming galaxies in the early Universe produced many more low mass stars than the IMF in the Milky Way disk, and was probably slightly steeper than the Salpeter form in the mass range 0.1 - 1 Msun."
https://openalex.org/W2060319444,"In contrast to planets with masses similar to that of Jupiter and higher, the bulk compositions of planets in the so-called super-Earth regime (masses 2-10 times that of the Earth) cannot be uniquely determined from a measurement of mass and radius alone. For these planets, there is a degeneracy between the mass and composition of both the interior and a possible atmosphere in theoretical models. The recently discovered transiting super-Earth exoplanet GJ 1214b is one example of this problem. Three distinct models for the planet that are consistent with its mass and radius have been suggested. Breaking the degeneracy between these models requires obtaining constraints on the planet's atmospheric composition. Here we report a ground-based measurement of the transmission spectrum of GJ 1214b between wavelengths of 780 and 1,000 nm. The lack of features in this spectrum rules out (at 4.9σ confidence) cloud-free atmospheres composed primarily of hydrogen. If the planet's atmosphere is hydrogen-dominated, then it must contain clouds or hazes that are optically thick at the observed wavelengths at pressures less than 200 mbar. Alternatively, the featureless transmission spectrum is also consistent with the presence of a dense, water vapour atmosphere."
https://openalex.org/W2055309955,"Haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) can convert between growth states that have marked differences in bioenergetic needs. Although often quiescent in adults, these cells become proliferative upon physiological demand. Balancing HSC energetics in response to nutrient availability and growth state is poorly understood, yet essential for the dynamism of the haematopoietic system. Here we show that the Lkb1 tumour suppressor is critical for the maintenance of energy homeostasis in haematopoietic cells. Lkb1 inactivation in adult mice causes loss of HSC quiescence followed by rapid depletion of all haematopoietic subpopulations. Lkb1-deficient bone marrow cells exhibit mitochondrial defects, alterations in lipid and nucleotide metabolism, and depletion of cellular ATP. The haematopoietic effects are largely independent of Lkb1 regulation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signalling. Instead, these data define a central role for Lkb1 in restricting HSC entry into cell cycle and in broadly maintaining energy homeostasis in haematopoietic cells through a novel metabolic checkpoint."

https://openalex.org/W1968530152,"Neuroblastoma is a childhood cancer of the sympathetic nervous system that accounts for approximately 10% of all paediatric oncology deaths. To identify genetic risk factors for neuroblastoma, we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) on 2,251 patients and 6,097 control subjects of European ancestry from four case series. Here we report a significant association within LIM domain only 1 (LMO1) at 11p15.4 (rs110419, combined P = 5.2 × 10(-16), odds ratio of risk allele = 1.34 (95% confidence interval 1.25-1.44)). The signal was enriched in the subset of patients with the most aggressive form of the disease. LMO1 encodes a cysteine-rich transcriptional regulator, and its paralogues (LMO2, LMO3 and LMO4) have each been previously implicated in cancer. In parallel, we analysed genome-wide DNA copy number alterations in 701 primary tumours. We found that the LMO1 locus was aberrant in 12.4% through a duplication event, and that this event was associated with more advanced disease (P < 0.0001) and survival (P = 0.041). The germline single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) risk alleles and somatic copy number gains were associated with increased LMO1 expression in neuroblastoma cell lines and primary tumours, consistent with a gain-of-function role in tumorigenesis. Short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated depletion of LMO1 inhibited growth of neuroblastoma cells with high LMO1 expression, whereas forced expression of LMO1 in neuroblastoma cells with low LMO1 expression enhanced proliferation. These data show that common polymorphisms at the LMO1 locus are strongly associated with susceptibility to developing neuroblastoma, but also may influence the likelihood of further somatic alterations at this locus, leading to malignant progression."
https://openalex.org/W2025880272,"The role of the fibronectin receptor, α5β1-integrin, as an adhesion receptor and in angiogenesis is well established. However, its role in cancer cell invasion and metastasis is less clear. We describe a novel mechanism by which fibronectin regulates ovarian cancer cell signaling and promotes metastasis. Fibronectin binding to α5β1-integrin led to a direct association of α5-integrin with the receptor tyrosine kinase, c-Met, activating it in a hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor (HGF/SF) independent manner. Subsequently, c-Met associated with Src, and activated Src and focal adhesion kinase (FAK). Inhibition of α5β1-integrin decreased the phosphorylation of c-Met, FAK and Src, both in vitro and in vivo. Independent activation of c-Met by its native ligand, HGF/SF, or overexpression of a constitutively active FAK in HeyA8 cells could overcome the effect of α5β1-integrin inhibition on tumor cell invasion, indicating that α5β1-integrin is upstream of c-Met, Src and FAK. Inhibition of α5β1-integrin on cancer cells in two xenograft models of ovarian cancer metastasis resulted in a significant decrease of tumor burden, which was independent of the effect of α5β1-integrin on angiogenesis. These data suggest that fibronectin promotes ovarian cancer invasion and metastasis through an α5β1-integrin/c-Met/FAK/Src-dependent signaling pathway, transducing signals through c-Met in an HGF/SF-independent manner."

https://openalex.org/W2062645823,"Doped Mott insulators have been shown to have a strong propensity to form patterns of holes and spins often referred to as stripes. In copper-oxides, doping also gives rise to the pseudogap state, which transforms into a high temperature superconductor with sufficient doping or by reducing the temperature. A long standing question has been the interplay between pseudogap, which is generic to all hole-doped cuprates, and stripes, whose static form occurs in only one family of cuprates over a narrow range of the phase diagram. Here we examine the spatial reorganization of electronic states with the onset of the pseudogap state at T* in the high-temperature superconductor Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+x using spectroscopic mapping with the scanning tunneling microscope (STM). We find that the onset of the pseudogap phase coincides with the appearance of electronic patterns that have the predicted characteristics of fluctuating stripes. As expected, the stripe patterns are strongest when the hole concentration in the CuO2 planes is close to 1/8 (per Cu). While demonstrating that the fluctuating stripes emerge with the onset of the pseudogap state and occur over a large part of the cuprate phase diagram, our experiments indicate that they are a consequence of pseudogap behavior rather than its cause."

https://openalex.org/W2043730876,"Leptin is a pleiotropic hormone acting both centrally and peripherally. It participates in a variety of biological processes, including energy metabolism, reproduction, and modulation of the immune response. So far, structural elements affecting leptin binding to its receptor remain unknown. We employed random mutagenesis of leptin, followed by selection of high affinity mutants by yeast surface display and discovered that replacing residue Asp-23 with a non-negatively charged amino acid leads to dramatically enhanced affinity of leptin for its soluble receptor. Rational mutagenesis of Asp-23 revealed the D23L substitution to be most effective. Coupling the Asp-23 mutation with alanine mutagenesis of three amino acids (L39A/D40A/F41A) previously reported to convert leptin into antagonist resulted in potent antagonistic activity. These novel superactive mouse and human leptin antagonists (D23L/L39A/D40A/F41A), termed SMLA and SHLA, respectively, exhibited over 60-fold increased binding to leptin receptor and 14-fold higher antagonistic activity in vitro relative to the L39A/D40A/F41A mutants. To prolong and enhance in vivo activity, SMLA and SHLA were monopegylated mainly at the N terminus. Administration of the pegylated SMLA to mice resulted in a remarkably rapid, significant, and reversible 27-fold more potent increase in body weight (as compared with pegylated mouse leptin antagonist), because of increased food consumption. Thus, recognition and mutagenesis of Asp-23 enabled construction of novel compounds that induce potent and reversible central and peripheral leptin deficiency. In addition to enhancing our understanding of leptin interactions with its receptor, these antagonists enable in vivo study of the role of leptin in metabolic and immune processes and hold potential for future therapeutic use in disease pathologies involving leptin.

Treatment with retinoic acid (RA) results in neural differentiation of neuroblastoma cells. We wanted to elucidate whether miRNAs contribute to the gene expression changes induced by RA in neuroblastoma cells and whether miRNA regulation is involved in the transduction of the RA signal. We show here that RA treatment of SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells results in profound changes in the expression pattern of miRNAs. Up to 42 different miRNA species significantly changed their expression (26 up-regulated and 16 down-regulated). Among them, the closely related miR-10a and -10b showed the most prominent expression changes. Induction of miR-10a and -10b by RA also could be detected in LA-N-1 neuroblastoma cells. Loss of function experiments demonstrated that miR-10a and -10b are essential mediators of RA-induced neuroblastoma differentiation and of the associated changes in migration, invasion, and in vivo metastasis. In addition, we found that the SR-family splicing factor SFRS1 (SF2/ASF) is a target for miR-10a -and -10b in HeLa and SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells. We show here that changes in miR-10a and -10b expression levels may regulate SFRS1-dependent alternative splicing and translational functions. Taken together, our results give support to the idea that miRNA regulation plays a key role in RA-induced neuroblastoma cell differentiation.

These tiny regulatory elements are transcribed as primary longer transcripts, which are then processed by Dicer and Drosha complexes into 21–23-nt mature miRNAs. One strand of the mature miRNA is then incorporated into the RNA-induced silencing complex to regulate gene expression by targeting the 3′-untranslated region (3′-UTR) of mRNAs with consequent translational repression and/or target mRNA degradation. This mode of action demonstrates the great regulatory potential of miRNAs, as a unique mRNA can be targeted by diverse miRNAs, and conversely, each miRNA may have 100s of different target mRNAs (for review, see Refs. 1Bartel D.P.

Cell Biol. 2009; 21: 452-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). In vertebrates, the highest variety of miRNAs is expressed in the brain than in any other tissue, suggesting an important role in nervous system development (3Miska E.A. Alvarez-Saavedra E. Townsend M. Yoshii A. Sestan N. Rakic P. Constantine-Paton M. Horvitz H.R. Genome Biol. 2004; 5: R68Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Lau P. Hudson L.D. Brain Res. 2010; 1338: 14-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Recent studies have revealed the importance of miRNA expression in neural development and differentiation. For instance, it has been reported that Dicer-deleted mice exhibit malformations of the midbrain and cerebellum and failure of neural crest and dopaminergic differentiation (5Huang T. Liu Y. Huang M. Zhao X. Cheng L. J. Mol. Cell Biol. 2010; 2: 152-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). In addition, three brain-specific miRNAs (miR-124a, miR-9, and miR-132) have been proposed to regulate the transcription factor REST that mediates neuronal identity (6Wu J. Xie X. Genome Biol. 2006; 7: R85Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar), and miR-132 seems also to be involved in the control of neuronal morphogenesis by decreasing the GTPase-activating protein, p250GAP (7Vo N. Klein M.E. Varlamova O. Keller D.M. Yamamoto T. Goodman R.H. Impey S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 16426-16431Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar). Conversely, de-regulation of miRNA action contributes to different pathological processes, including cancer (8Shenouda S.K. Alahari S.K.

In recent years miRNAs have been established as important regulators of tumor development, progression, and metastasis and have demonstrated to be useful for tumor diagnosis and classification. Moreover, miRNA regulation might represent a new avenue for cancer treatment in a near future (10Baranwal S. Alahari S.K. Int. J. Cancer. 2010; 126: 1283-1290PubMed Google Scholar, 11Cho W.C.

Neuroblastoma is the most common extracranial solid tumor in childhood and the most common tumor in infants, which originates from aberrant development of primordial neural crest cells (15Brodeur G.M. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 203-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (1708) Google Scholar, 16Mueller S. Matthay K.K. Curr. Oncol. Rep. 2009; 11: 431-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Despite their tumor origin, neuroblastoma cell lines can be induced to differentiate in vitro by several agents, including retinoic acid (RA) (17Sidell N. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1982; 68: 589-596PubMed Google Scholar, 18Påhlman S. Ruusala A.I. Abrahamsson L. Mattsson M.E. Esscher T.

Administration of RA to neuroblastoma cells in vitro leads to proliferative arrest and neuronal differentiation as judged by their morphology and the expression of biochemical and functional neuronal markers (20Tsokos M. Scarpa S. Ross R.A. Triche T.J. Am. J. Pathol. 1987; 128: 484-496PubMed Google Scholar, 21Giannini G. Dawson M.I. Zhang X. Thiele C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26693-26701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In addition, to inhibit cell proliferation and induce differentiation, long term RA treatment reduces the biological aggressiveness of neuroblastoma cells by reducing their migratory and invasive abilities (22Voigt A.

In this study we show that RA treatment of SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells results in profound changes in the expression pattern of miRNAs. Up to 42 different miRNA species significantly change their expression levels (26 up-regulated and 16 down-regulated). Among them, the closely related miR-10a and -10b showed the most prominent expression changes. Through loss of function experiments we could show that miR-10a and -10b contribute to the regulation of RA-induced differentiation and in the associated changes in migratory and invasive activities. In addition we could determine that the SR-family splicing factor SFRS1 (SF2/ASF) is a target for miR-10a and -10b action, and we show that changes in miR-10a and -10b expression levels may influence cellular processes in which SFRS1 is involved. Our results give support to the idea that miRNA regulation plays a key role in RA-induced neuroblastoma cell differentiation and in the associated gene expression changes. SH-SY5Y (ATCC CRL-2266) and HeLa (ATCC CCL-2) cells were cultured in DMEM containing 10% heat-inactivated FBS, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. LA-N-1 cells (European Collection of Animal Cell Cultures ECACC 06041201) were grown on gelatin-coated plastic dishes in a 1:1 mixture of EMEM and Ham's F-12 medium containing 15% heat-inactivated FBS, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 1% nonessential amino acids. Cell cultures were kept at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2. The medium was replaced every 2 days, and the cells were split before they reached confluence. RA (all-trans retinoic acid, Sigma) was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide and added to the culture medium at 1 μm concentration. For miRNA expression, profiling real-time RT-PCR was performed using TaqMan Human MicroRNA Low Density Arrays Version 2.0 (Applied Biosystems). A comprehensive coverage of Sanger miRBase v10 is enabled across the two-card set of TaqMan MicroRNA arrays for a total of 667 unique assays specific to human miRNAs. In addition, each array contains four control assays, three endogenous control assays and one negative control assay. SH-SY5Y cells were treated with 1 μm RA during 0, 24, 48, and 96 h (4 replicate 100-mm dishes for each condition). Total RNA was extracted using the mirVana kit (Ambion-Applied Biosystems) and quantified by spectrophotometry and the integrity of the RNA evaluated in agarose gels. Retro-transcription, pre-amplification, and real-time PCR of miRNAs were made following the Megaplex Pools for microRNA Expression Analysis Protocol. All reagents were obtained from Applied Biosystems. Both reverse transcription and pre-amplification were made with two different pools of primers (A and B), corresponding to the miRNAs represented in the array A and B, respectively. 1 μg of total RNA was reverse-transcribed using Megaplex RT primers and the TaqMan miRNA reverse transcription kit in a total of 7.5 μl volume. Then the reverse-transcribed product (2.5 μl) was pre-amplified using Megaplex PreAmp Primers and TaqMan PreAmp Master Mix in a 25-μl reaction. The pre-amplified cDNA was diluted 1:4 with 0.1× Tris-EDTA, pH 8.0, and quantitative real-time PCR was performed using Applied Biosystems 7900HT system and a TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix with 9 μl of diluted cDNA input per plate. Data from real-time RT-PCRs were analyzed using the Applied Biosystems 7900HT Fast Real-Time PCR System Relative Quantitation Using Comparative Ct in SDS v2.2 software. The experimental data have been analyzed with the automatic base line and manual Ct set to 0.2. The amplification plots have been reviewed manually and the base-line and the threshold settings adjusted for individual assays, if necessary. Because a Ct value of 35 represents single molecule template detection, Ct values >35 were considered to be below the detection level of the assay. Therefore, only the miRNAs with a Ct ≤ 35 were included in the analyses. A moderate t test between all treated versus non-treated groups was performed and corrected using the Benjamini-Hochberg algorithm with the false discovery rate set at a value of 5%. SH-SY5Y cells were seeded at 500,000 cells/well in 6-well plates. On the next day, the cells were transfected with one of the RNA oligonucleotides (anti-miR-10a, anti-miR-10b, negative control anti-miR, pre-miR-10a, pre-miR-10b, and negative control pre-miR; Ambion-Applied Biosystems) at 50 nm final concentration using 5 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) and Opti-MEM medium. After 6 h of transfection, the medium was changed to fresh SH-SY5Y growth medium with 1 μm RA or vehicle. HeLa cells were seeded at 250,000 cells/well in 6-well plates and transfected as described above for SH-SY5Y cells. The 3′-UTRs of the putative target genes (SFRS1 and SFRS10) were amplified by PCR and cloned downstream to the luciferase reporter gene into the XbaI site of pGL3-Control vector (Promega). Reporter genes were sequenced to assess the right sequence and orientation of the fragments. HeLa cells were seeded at 50,000 cells/well, and the following day, 500 ng of luciferase reporter construct (SFRS1 3′-UTR or SFRS10 3′-UTR) and 25 ng of Renilla luciferase reporter construct as internal control were co-transfected together with one of the RNA oligonucleotides at a 50 nm final concentration using 3 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) and Opti-MEM medium as described above. After 48 h the cells were lysed, and firefly and Renilla luciferase activities from cell extracts were measured with the dual-luciferase reporter system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The effects of miRNA regulation on SFRS1-mediated translational regulation were analyzed with reporter plasmids pLCS-EDAwt and pLCS-EDAmt (34Sanford J.R. Gray N.K. Beckmann K. Cáceres J.F. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 755-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar), which were transfected as described (35Laserna E.J. Valero M.L. Sanz L. Sánchez del Pino M.M. Calvete J.J. Barettino D. Mol. Endocrinol. 2009; 23: 1799-1814Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) together with one of the RNA oligonucleotides at a 50 nm final concentration. Total RNA was extracted from SH-SY5Y, HeLa, and LA-N-1 cells using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and then quantified by spectrophotometry. For quantitative real-time PCR of miRNA, 10 ng of total RNA was reverse-transcribed in a 15-μl total reaction volume using specific stem-loop RT primers (Applied Biosystems), and 1.33 μl of cDNA was subjected to a TaqMan miRNA assay (Applied Biosystems) in 20 μl of total reaction using primers and probe specific for individual human miRNAs according to the manufacturer's protocol. Expression values were calculated using the comparative Ct method, and U6 snRNA was used as an endogenous control. For quantitative real-time PCR of mRNAs, 1 μg of total RNA was reverse-transcribed using oligo(dT)16 and Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase as described (36Martí D. Miquel R. Ziani K. Gisbert R. Ivorra M.D. Anselmi E. Moreno L. Villagrasa V. Barettino D. D'Ocon P. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2005; 289: H1923-H1932Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). 1 μl of a 10-fold cDNA dilution was subjected to SYBR Green or TaqMan gene expression assays (Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Expression values were also calculated using comparative Ct method, and GAPDH gene was used as endogenous control. Reactions were run in an Applied Biosystems 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR system. For [3H]thymidine incorporation assays, SH-SY5Y cells were seeded in 24-well plates at 50,000 cells/well and transfected the following day with anti-miR-10a, anti-miR-10b, or negative control anti-miR at 50 nm final concentration using 1 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) and Opti-MEM medium as described above. After 6 h of transfection, the medium was changed to fresh SH-SY5Y growth medium supplemented with 1 μm RA or vehicle. After 96 h of RA treatment, cells were pulse-labeled for 6 h with 1 μCi/ml of [3H]thymidine deoxyribose (5 Ci/mmol, Amersham Biosciences). The cells were then harvested with 10% TCA by shaking for 10 min and processed for liquid scintillation counting. For the determination of DNA content SH-SY5Y cells were transfected with anti-miR-10a, anti-miR-10b, or negative control anti-miR in 6-well plates as described above. After transfection, the medium was changed to fresh SH-SY5Y growth medium with 1 μm RA or vehicle. After 96 h of RA treatment the cells were washed in PBS and fixed in 80% ethanol for 60 min at 4 °C. The cells were then washed with PBS and treated with DNA extraction buffer (0.2 m Na2HPO4, 0.1 m citric acid, pH 7.8) for 5 min at 37 °C. Samples were centrifuged, and cellular DNA was stained with 20 μg/ml propidium iodide (Sigma) and 0.2 mg/ml DNase-free RNase A (Sigma) in PBS for 30 min at 37 °C in the dark. After cytometry in a FACSCanto cytometer (BD Biosciences), the cell cycle phases were determined by using the ModFit LT 3.0 package. Cells were washed with PBS and lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm HEPES pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm NaF, 0,5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 100 μm PMSF). The extract was cleared by centrifugation at 4 °C, and the protein content was determined with Bio-Rad protein assay. Western blot was performed as described (37Masiá S. Alvarez S. de Lera A.R. Barettino D. Mol. Endocrinol. 2007; 21: 2391-2402Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Antibodies against tyrosine hydroxylase were obtained from Cell Signaling Technologies, those against ID2 and SFRS1 were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, and those against β-actin and NEFM were obtained from Sigma. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were obtained from GE Healthcare. The migration and invasion capacities of SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells were tested according to published protocols (38McCarthy J.B. Palm S.L. Furcht L.T. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 97: 772-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 39Albini A. Iwamoto Y. Kleinman H.K. Martin G.R. Aaronson S.A. Kozlowski J.M. McEwan R.N. Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 3239-3245PubMed Google Scholar) with slight modifications. A modified, light-opaque Boyden chamber (Falcon HTS FluoroBlock, 8 μm pore size; BD Biosciences) was used in migration assays. SH-SY5Y cells were transfected with 50 nm negative control anti-miR, anti-miR-10a, or anti-miR-10b, respectively, and treated with 1 μm RA for 96 h. After 96 h of treatment, cells were labeled in the plate with calcein AM (5 μm; Molecular Probes-Invitrogen) for 30 min at 37 °C. Labeled cells were detached from the plate by scraping and counted. For migration assays, the lower chamber of the plate contained 10% FBS as chemo-attractant. 5 × 104 labeled cells in serum-free medium were added onto the upper chamber. After 6 h of incubation at 37 °C, the fluorescent light emitted by the cells that migrated through the opaque filter was measured with a Victor2 multilabel counter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The assays were performed in triplicate. For invasion assays SH-SY5Y cells were transfected with 50 nm negative control anti-miR, anti-miR-10a, or anti-miR-10b, respectively, and treated with 1 μm RA or vehicle for 96 h after the above protocol. After 96 h of treatment, cells were trypsinized, and 0.3 × 106 cells were transferred to transwell chambers precoated with 10 μg Matrigel® (BD Biosciences) matrix. Medium containing 10% FBS in the lower chamber served as chemo-attractant. Plates were incubated for 24 h. After 24 h of incubation, the invading cells were detached from the bottom of the membrane by placing the 24-well inserts in 24-well plates prepared with 500 μl trypsin/well and incubating them at 37 °C for 10 min. Non-invading cells from the top of the membrane were removed using 200 μl of trypsin. Invading and non-invading cells were transferred to 1.5-ml tubes and centrifuged at 1200 rpm for 5 min to remove the trypsin. Then, cells in each well were resuspended in 50 μl of Cell Titer-Glo® reagent (Promega), and lysates were plated in 96-well plate. The luminescence signal was read according to the manufacturer's instructions, and the invasion ratio from the three replicates were calculated and expressed as the mean ± S.D. The chicken chorioallantoic membrane assay was performed as described previously (40Zijlstra A. Mellor R. Panzarella G. Aimes R.T. Hooper J.D. Marchenko N.D. Quigley J.P. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 7083-7092PubMed Google Scholar, 41Mudduluru G. Vajkoczy P. Allgayer H. Mol. Cancer Res. 2010; 8: 159-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). In brief, negative control anti-miR- or anti-miR-10a-transfected cells were treated with 1 μm RA or vehicle for 96 h. Then, 1 × 106 cells were placed on the upper chorioallantoic membrane of 10-day-old chicken embryos. After 7 days the chicken embryos were dissected, and the quantification of the metastatic cells was performed on genomic DNA from embryonic lungs prepared using the Puregene DNA purification system (Qiagen). Quantification of human Alu sequences in the extracted DNA was performed by TaqMan quantitative PCR as described (42van der Horst E.H. Leupold J.H. Schubbert R. Ullrich A. Allgayer H. Biotechniques. 2004; 37 (944, 946): 940-942Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Six parallel assays were performed for each condition. Pairwise comparisons between sample groups were analyzed by the one-tailed Student's t test, with statistically significant differences between the means indicated as p < 0.05 (*), p < 0.01 (**), or p < 0.001 (***). We wanted to understand the contribution of microRNAs to the gene expression changes occurring during RA-induced differentiation of human neuroblastoma cells. With this aim we have analyzed the changes in the miRNA expression profile of SH-SY5Y cells upon treatment with 1 μm RA for 0, 24, 48, and 96 h. For this purpose, we used TaqMan Human MicroRNA Low Density Arrays v2.0 (Applied Biosystems), which provide comprehensive coverage of Sanger miRBase v10 for a total of 667 unique assays specific to human miRNAs. The data from real-time RT-PCRs were analyzed through the Relative Quantitation Using Comparative Ct method. The data were normalized against U6 snRNA, and a moderate t test and a correction using the Benjamini-Hochberg algorithm with the false discovery rate set at a value of 5% was performed between all the treated versus non-treated comparisons. On the basis of this analysis, 452 human miRNAs could be detected, whereas 215 did not reach the detection threshold. Among those, 452 miRNAs present, 42 showed a statistically significant change in expression at least in two of the three treated versus untreated comparisons (Fig. 1A). From these 42 miRNAs, a set of 26 miRNAs was up-regulated, and a group of 16 miRNAs was down-regulated during the RA treatment (Fig. 1, B and C). Among the up-regulated group we found that miR-10a, -10b, -10b*, -615–5p, -211, -212, -132, -22, -766, -135a, and -148b* had a robust pattern of induction. On the other hand we found miR-490–3p, -154*, 26a-2*, -296–3p, -422a, -486–3p, -378, -411*, -543, -801, -873, and -107 had a robust pattern of down-regulation. The expression of the 12 miRNAs with most prominent changes was validated by real-time RT-PCRs using Applied Biosystems TaqMan individual specific assays to human miRNAs (Fig. 1, D and E). All the validated miRNAs showed significant change in their expression, confirming to the pattern observed in the array data. Among the group of differentially expressed miRNAs, two members of miR-10 family, miRNA-10a and -10b, were strongly up-regulated and showed a similar pattern of induction. Induction of miR-10a and -10b by RA occurred to comparable levels in another human neuroblastoma cell line, LA-N-1 (Fig. 1, F and G). To gather information about the roles of miR-10a and -10b in RA-induced neuroblastoma differentiation, we have performed loss of function experiments with antisense miRNA antagonists (anti-miRs) and evaluated their effects on the morphology, the proliferation rate, and the expression of differentiation and neuronal markers in neuroblastoma cells. After transfection of each specific anti-miR to SH-SY5Y cells and treatment with RA, near 60% of reduction of miRNA-10a and -10b endogenous levels was achieved (Fig. 2F). Cells in which the expression of miR-10a and -10b was reduced with specific anti-miRs showed impaired differentiation. Untreated neuroblastoma cells bear short neurites and grow as high density cell clusters. Upon RA treatment, extension of neurites took place, and the cells spread on the plate surface. When anti-miR-10a/-10b were transfected and the cells treated with RA, a reduction in the length of neurites and an increase in the cell cluster number could be observed as compared with cells transfected with negative control anti-miR (Fig. 2, A–E). Quantification of neurite length using Neuron J software (43Meijering E. Jacob M. Sarria J.C. Steiner P. Hirling H. Unser M. Cytometry A. 2004; 58: 167-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (1120) Google Scholar) show that RA treatment of cells transfected with anti-miR-10a or -10b resulted in reduced neurite length, as compared with cells transfected with negative control (NC)-anti-miR (Fig. 2G). RA treatment of neuroblastoma cells also results in proliferative arrest, and the effects of miR-10a and -10b suppression on proliferation of SH-SY5Y cells have been analyzed. Treatment of neuroblastoma cells with RA for 96 h led to a strong reduction of the incorporation of [3H]thymidine to ∼30% of the control values. However, this reduction of the proliferation was equally observed in RA-treated cells transfected with anti-miR-10a or -10b (Fig. 2G). Consequently, the percentage of cells in S-phase is reduced to half as the effect of RA treatment for 96 h, evaluated after cytometry of propidium iodide-stained cells. After transfection of miR-10a or-10b, a similar reduction in the fraction of cells in S-phase could be observed (Fig. 2H). Finally, we have tested whether the suppression of miR-10a and -10b would affect apoptosis of neuroblastoma cells. By analyzing the cellular DNA content by means of cytometry in propidium iodide-stained cells, we could not detect an increase in sub-G1 cell population after transfection of anti-miR-10a or -10b, supporting the idea that miR-10a and -10b are not involved in the regulation of apoptosis (data not shown).

We sought to discover microRNAs involved in gastric cancer, and to elucidate their downstream target mechanisms. Both cultured gastric epithelial cells (HFE145 and NCI-N87) and primary human gastric tissues (31 non-neoplastic stomach (NS) and 25 gastric carcinomas (GC)) were studied. MicroRNA microarrays and quantitative RT-PCR were applied to discover and verify differentially expressed microRNAs. in vitro cell migration and invasion, cell proliferation, cell cycle and apoptosis assays were executed to elucidate biological effects of microRNA-192 and -215. Western blotting and luciferase assays were performed to confirm direct messenger RNA targeting by microRNA-192 and -215. MicroRNA microarray analyses revealed that 25 and 20 microRNAs were upregulated and downregulated in GC vs NS, respectively. Expression levels of both microRNA-192 and -215 were significantly higher in GC than in NS (P<0.05). Luciferase assays suggested that microRNA-215 inhibits activated leukocyte cell adhesion molecule (ALCAM) expression at the posttranscriptional level. In addition, expression levels of ALCAM were significantly lower in GC than in NS. Mimics and inhibitors, respectively, of microRNA-192 or -215 exerted no effect on cell cycle or apoptosis in the immortalized normal gastric cell line HFE145 or the gastric cancer cell line NCI-N87. However, mimics of microRNA-192 or -215 significantly increased growth rates in HFE145 cells, whereas inhibitors of microRNA-192 or -215 caused significant decreases in growth rates in NCI-N87 cells. ALCAM knockdown by an ALCAM-specific siRNA significantly increased cell growth in HFE145 cells. Both transfection of mimics of microRNA-192 or -215 and ALCAM knockdown by an ALCAM-specific siRNA significantly increased the migration of HFE145 cells. In conclusion, in gastric cancer, both microRNA-192 and -215 are overexpressed in vivo and exert cell growth and migration-promoting effects in vitro, thus representing potential microRNAs with a role in cancer in the human stomach."

https://openalex.org/W2094810151,"Transcriptional regulation by hormonal 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25(OH)2D3] involves occupancy of vitamin D response elements (VDREs) by the VDRE binding protein (VDRE-BP) or 1,25(OH)2D3-bound vitamin D receptor (VDR). This relationship is disrupted by elevated VDRE-BP, causing a form of hereditary vitamin D-resistant rickets (HVDRR). DNA array analysis showed that of 114 genes regulated by 1,25(OH)2D3 in control cells, almost all (113) were rendered insensitive to the hormone in VDRE-BP-overexpressing HVDRR cells. Among these was the gene for DNA-damage-inducible transcript 4 (DDIT4), an inhibitor of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling. Chromatin immunoprecipitation PCR using 1,25(OH)2D3-treated osteoblasts confirmed that VDR and VDRE-BP compete for binding to the DDIT4 gene promoter. Expression of DDIT4 mRNA in these cells was induced (1.6–6 fold) by 1,25(OH)2D3 (10–100 nM), and Western blot and flow cytometry analysis showed that this response involved suppression of phosphorylated S6K1T389 (a downstream target of mTOR) similar to rapamycin treatment. siRNA knockdown of DDIT4 completely abrogated antiproliferative responses to 1,25(OH)2D3, whereas overexpression of VDRE-BP exerted a dominant-negative effect on transcription of 1,25(OH)2D3-target genes. DDIT4, an inhibitor of mTOR signaling, is a direct target for 1,25(OH)2D3 and VDRE-BP, and functions to suppress cell proliferation in response to vitamin D.—Lisse, T.

https://openalex.org/W1993685254,"Peptaibols are a group of small peptides having a high α-aminoisobutyric acid (Aib) content and produced by filamentous fungi, especially by the members of the genus Trichoderma (anamorph Hypocrea). These antibiotics are economically important for their anti-microbial and anti-cancer properties as well as ability to induce systemic resistance in plants against microbial invasion. In this study we present sequences of two classes (11-residue and 14-residue) of peptaibols produced by the biocontrol fungus Trichoderma virens. Of the 35 11-residue peptaibols sequenced, 18 are hitherto not described, and all the 53 14-residue sequences described by us here are new. We have also identified a peptaibol synthetase (non-ribosomal peptide synthetase, NRPS) with 14 complete modules in the genome of this fungus and disruption of this single gene (designated as tex2) resulted in the loss of both the classes of peptaibols. We, thus present here an unprecedented case where a single NRPS encodes for two classes of peptaibols. The new peptaibols identified here could have applications as therapeutic agents for the management of human and plant health."
https://openalex.org/W2026250050,"Some mutations in FOXL2 result in premature ovarian failure accompanied by blepharophimosis, ptosis, epicanthus inversus syndrome type I disease, and FOXL2-null mice exhibit developmental defects in granulosa cells. Recently, FOXL2 c.402C>G, a new somatic mutation that leads to a p.C134W change, was found in the majority of adult-type ovarian granulosa cell tumors (GCTs). In this study, we investigated the possible mechanisms by which the C134W mutation contributes to the development of GCTs. Wild-type (WT) and mutant FOXL2 displayed differential apoptotic activities. Specifically, WT FOXL2 induced significant granulosa cell death, but the mutant exhibited minimal cell death. The FOXL2-induced apoptotic response was greatly dependent on caspase 8, BID and BAK because the depletion of any of these three proteins inhibited FOXL2 from eliciting the full apoptotic response. Activation of caspase 8 and subsequent increased production of truncated BID, and oligomerization of BAK, and release of cytochrome c were all associated with the apoptosis induced by WT FOXL2 expression. In contrast, the mutant FOXL2 was unable to elicit the full array of apoptotic signaling responses. In addition, we found differential TNF-R1 (tumor necrosis factor-receptor 1) and Fas (CD95/APO-1) upregulation between the WT and the mutant, and the silencing of TNF-R1 or Fas and the blockage of the death signaling mediated by TNF-R1 or Fas using TNF-Fc or Fas-Fc, respectively, resulted in significant attenuations of FOXL2-induced apoptosis. Moreover, granulosa cells that expressed either WT FOXL2 or mutant exhibited distinct cell death sensitivities on activation of death receptors and deprivation of serum. Thus, the differential activities of FOXL2 and its mutant may partially account for the pathophysiology of GCT development."

In the only prior A3G AFM reports, Chelico et al. (25Chelico L. Prochnow C. Erie D.A. Chen X.S. Goodman M.F. J. Biol.

This work suggested that A3G forms stable complexes with ssDNA. Large oligomers appeared to be involved in complex formation, and the stoichiometry of these complexes appeared to be influenced by salt concentrations and divalent cations. However, the lack of internal size standards and the inherent flexibility of ssDNA prevented the unambiguous determination of A3G-ssDNA complexes from substrate-free A3G complexes.Here, we use AFM and a hybrid DNA substrate (a molecular ruler) to clearly differentiate between free A3G and ssDNA-bound complexes. The hybrid DNA substrate is composed of a 235-bp DNA duplex spliced to a 69-nucleotide-long 5′-ssDNA tail. Both the duplex and the tail could be visualized with our instrumentation, and A3G was located exclusively within the ssDNA region of the hybrid substrate. Comparisons with the tetrameric Escherichia coli single-strand DNA-binding protein (SSB) and precise protein volume measurements enabled us to determine that A3G binds ssDNA substrates predominantly as a dimer. At the same time, unbound protein was primarily monomeric. The stoichiometry of the A3G-ssDNA complexes was unchanged in the absence of Mg2+ cations. Replacement of Mg2+ cations with Zn2+ cations slightly increased the yield of tetramers, but dimers were still more abundant overall. An H248A/H250A mutant predicted to lack a zinc-mediated intermolecular bridge observed recently in a crystal structure (Protein Data Bank code 3IR2 (19Shandilya S.M. Nalam M.N. Nalivaika E.A.

These findings suggest a mechanism for A3G assembly on ssDNA and clarify the model HIV restriction by A3G in which dimeric A3G is the form of the protein that deanimates viral cDNA and results in guanine-to-adenine hypermutations.DISCUSSIONThe combination of sensitive AFM techniques, a novel hybrid DNA ruler, and purified A3G from human cells has enabled the first images of this HIV restriction factor bound to ssDNA. A3G is predominantly dimeric when bound to ssDNA, in contrast to native protein, which appears mostly monomeric. Some higher order oligomers are also observed in ssDNA complexes, and their existence is influenced by His-248 and His-250, which coordinate zinc and form a intermolecular bridge in the A3G catalytic domain crystal lattice (19Shandilya S.M. Nalam M.N. Nalivaika E.A. Gross P.J. Valesano J.C. Shindo K. Li M. Munson M. Royer W.E. Harjes E. Kono T. Matsuo H. Harris R.S. Somasundaran M. Schiffer C.A.

Overall, our data are consistent with a model in which ssDNA-bound A3G is dimeric and enzymatically active.Our observations are concordant with prior studies demonstrating A3G oligomerization in living cells and in vitro (4Cen S.

However, although mutation of His-248 and His-250 reduces the number of higher order A3G-ssDNA oligomeric complexes observed by AFM (and diminishes the overall yield), these residues are dispensable for cytoplasmic localization, P body formation, and high molecular mass formation in living cells (supplemental Fig. S5 and data not shown). Taken together, these observations suggest that RNA binding, other A3G surfaces (independent of His-248 and His-250), and potentially heterologous protein-protein interactions may regulate A3G oligomerization in vivo.Our data help distinguish between two models for A3G-ssDNA complex formation. In the first, a dimer may form when two monomers bind adjacent to one another on ssDNA. Alternatively, dimers may first form in solution and then engage ssDNA. In the framework of the first model, monomer binding will be the primary mode at low protein concentrations, and the number of dimeric complexes will grow as the protein concentration increases. The second model predicts that the distribution of complexes depends on the binding constant for each type of the complex, so the yield of dimers will be higher than for the monomers if the dimers form more stable complexes than monomers. Our data are in line with the second model. Indeed, the data in Fig. 3B indicate that the yield of dimers is considerably higher than that of monomers. These observations were made under nonsaturating conditions, and the yield of complexes was 82%. We performed additional experiments in which the protein/DNA ratio was decreased an additional 5-fold (supplemental Fig. S6). According to these data, the major product is still a dimer with a low yield of monomers. A 4-fold drop in the yield of complexes was observed under these conditions. In experiments in which divalent cations were removed (Fig. 6), the yield of complexes dropped 3 times, but the monomeric complexes formed with the same low efficiency. Altogether, the data support the second model for A3G complex formation in which A3G dimers form much more stable complexes than monomers.Although AFM measures the sizes of the sample in three dimensions, enabling one to measure the volume of the sample, a number of variables such as the tip convolution effect and the conversion of the image volume to the sample volume and eventually to the molecular mass require careful calibration (30Lushnikov A.Y. Potaman V.N. Oussatcheva E.A. Sinden R.R. Lyubchenko Y.L. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 152-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 31Lyubchenko Y.L. Shlyakhtenko L.S. Methods. 2009; 47: 206-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). To address this issue, we used the well characterized E. coli SSB as a calibration standard. Similarly to A3G, SSB binds specifically to ssDNA. Various studies including x-ray crystallography (46Raghunathan S. Ricard C.S. Lohman T.M. Waksman G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1997; 94: 6652-6657Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar) have shown that SSB binds ssDNA as a tetramer, and it is therefore an appropriate standard for converting A3G volume data to molecular masses. Importantly, the maxima on histograms for SSB and A3G complexes almost coincide (Figs. 2B and 3B); therefore, as shown in Fig. 3, the A3G dimers are the most representative oligomeric forms. The population of trimers and tetramers is low. Importantly, unbound protein is primarily in the monomeric state, suggesting that the interaction with ssDNA changes the stoichiometry of A3G. The observed dimeric stoichiometry of A3G bound to the ssDNA substrate is concordant with two recent studies (42Huthoff H. Autore F. Gallois-Montbrun S. Fraternali F. Malim M.H. PLoS Pathog. 2009; 5: e1000330Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 43Salter J.D. Krucinska J. Raina J. Smith H.C. Wedekind J.E. Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 10685-10687Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar).However, our data contrast with the only prior AFM studies of A3G-ssDNA complexes, which indicated that dimeric A3G is a minor species (40% monomer, 14% dimer, and 46% higher order oligomers in the presence of 5 mm MgCl2) (25Chelico L. Prochnow C. Erie D.A. Chen X.S. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 16195-16205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 27Chelico L. Sacho E.J. Erie D.A. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 13780-13791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). These prior studies also suggested that salt (Mg2+ cations) facilitates the formation of the higher order oligomers. A possible explanation for this discrepancy is that Chelico et al. (25Chelico L. Prochnow C. Erie D.A. Chen X.S. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 16195-16205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 27Chelico L. Sacho E.J. Erie D.A. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 13780-13791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) used short ssDNA oligonucleotides, which may be difficult to distinguish from free protein complexes. Our hybrid DNA substrate in which ssDNA is attached to one end of a dsDNA fragment eliminates this ambiguity because A3G-bound complexes are identified as bright blobs located at the end of the DNA duplex. Importantly, the morphology of free ends is entirely different from the morphology of the complexes (Figs. 2B and 3A). Another potential variable is protein source: Chelico et al. used E. coli- or baculovirus-expressed A3G, whereas we used A3G prepared from human cells (Fig. 1).The role of divalent ions in A3G complex formation and its stoichiometry is another finding. The comparison of effects of Mg2+ and Zn2+ cations indicated that A3G stoichiometry in the ssDNA-bound complexes remains essentially the same, mostly dimeric regardless of the type of divalent cation. However, the yield of complexes depends on the cation type, so the replacement of Mg2+ cations with Zn2+ leads to an almost 20-fold decrease in complex yield. At the same time, complete removal of Mg2+ cations does not have such a dramatic effect, although a 3-fold decrease in complex yield was observed. According to a recent model for A3G dimerization (42Huthoff H. Autore F. Gallois-Montbrun S. Fraternali F. Malim M.H. PLoS Pathog. 2009; 5: e1000330Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), the charge distribution over the dimer surface is not uniform. Rather, a positive charge is clustered in a rather narrow area of the monomer-monomer interface, and this region may interact with negatively charged RNA. If electrostatics are the predominant forces that stabilize the A3G-ssDNA complexes, we should observe a decrease in the yield of the complexes at elevated ionic strengths. Mg2+ cations effectively shield electrostatic interactions decreasing the Debye radius; therefore, in the presence of Mg2+ cations, the yield of complexes should go down. Our data show the opposite effect, suggesting that the interaction of A3G with ssDNA does not have a pure strong electrostatic nature. A dramatic drop in the yield of the complexes upon the addition of Zn2+ cations (25 mm) suggests that the addition of this cation induces conformational changes in the dimer that may not be favorable for binding ssDNA.The atomic structure of the A3G-ssDNA complex has eluded efforts to date, although indirect methods have yielded considerable information about this interaction. Gel shift studies showed that at least 16 nucleotides are needed for the formation of stable complexes (26Iwatani Y. Takeuchi H. Strebel K. Levin J.G. J. Virol. 2006; 80: 5992-6002Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Biochemical studies suggested that A3G does not remain stably bound to ssDNA but that it translocates randomly by a series of jumps and slides and/or intersegmental transfers (23Chelico L. Pham P. Calabrese P. Goodman M.F. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 392-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 27Chelico L. Sacho E.J. Erie D.A. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 13780-13791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). A3G also has preferred reaction polarity favoring deamination toward the 5′-end of ssDNA substrates. The preferred target site is 5′-CCC with a strong bias toward the third cytosine, and deamination rarely occurs near the 3′-end of substrates. This leads to a so-called deamination “dead zone” (27Chelico L. Sacho E.J. Erie D.A. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 13780-13791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Given these properties and the 69-nt length of the ssDNA portion of our hybrid DNA substrate, we anticipated seeing both A3G bound to ssDNA and a visible fraction of unbound ssDNA. However, this scenario was not observed because ssDNA was apparent only in free hybrid substrates. Our observations suggest that dimeric A3G somehow occupies most of the 69-nt ssDNA region. We speculate that ssDNA wraps around the A3G dimer as it does around the SSB tetramer (46Raghunathan S. Ricard C.S. Lohman T.M. Waksman G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1997; 94: 6652-6657Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 47Roy R. Kozlov A.G. Lohman T.M. Ha T. Nature. 2009; 461: 1092-1097Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) because both complexes yielded morphologically similar AFM images.

Here, we demonstrate that a thiol-disulfide redox switch controls the interaction between heme and the ligand-binding domain of Rev-erbβ. The reduced dithiol state of Rev-erbβ binds heme 5-fold more tightly than the oxidized disulfide state. By means of site-directed mutagenesis and by UV-visible and EPR spectroscopy, we also show that the ferric heme of reduced (dithiol) Rev-erbβ can undergo a redox-triggered switch from imidazole/thiol ligation (via His-568 and Cys-384, based on a prior crystal structure) to His/neutral residue ligation upon oxidation to the disulfide form. On the other hand, we find that change in the redox state of iron has no effect on heme binding to the ligand-binding domain of the protein. The low dissociation constant for the complex between Fe3+- or Fe2+-heme and the reduced dithiol state of the protein (Kd = ∼20 nm) is in the range of the intracellular free heme concentration. We also determined that the Fe2+-heme bound to the ligand-binding domain of Rev-erbβ has high affinity for CO (Kd = 60 nm), which replaces one of the internal ligands when bound. We suggest that this thiol-disulfide redox switch is one mechanism by which oxidative stress is linked to circadian and/or metabolic imbalance. Heme dissociation from Rev-erbβ has been shown to derepress the expression of target genes in response to changes in intracellular redox conditions. We propose that oxidative stress leads to oxidation of cysteine(s), thus releasing heme from Rev-erbβ and altering its transcriptional activity.

Nuclear receptors regulate gene expression in response to small molecules, controlling key eukaryotic events such as development, differentiation, reproduction, and metabolic homeostasis (1Bain D.L. Heneghan A.F. Connaghan-Jones K.D. Miura M.T. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2007; 69: 201-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). All nuclear receptors possess a highly conserved N-terminal DNA-binding domain and a less conserved C-terminal ligand-binding domain (LBD), 2The abbreviations used are: LBD, ligand-binding domain; TCEP, tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine; HDAC, histone deacetylase; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. which recognizes small molecules (2Olefsky J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36863-36864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). The LBD in nuclear receptors is typically coupled to transcriptional activation through an activation function-2 domain, which promotes recruitment of a coactivator (1Bain D.L. Heneghan A.F. Connaghan-Jones K.D. Miura M.T. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2007; 69: 201-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Rev-erbβ (also known as RVR and BD73) and Rev-erbα are unique members of the superfamily of nuclear receptors because they lack an activation function-2 domain (3Downes M. Burke L.J. Bailey P.J.

In turn, the Rev-erb-nuclear corepressor-HDAC complex facilitates the repression of target genes involved in glucose, lipid, and bile acid metabolism, as well as in regulating the circadian cycle and the proinflammatory response (3Downes M. Burke L.J. Bailey P.J. Muscat G.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4379-4386Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 4Retnakaran R. Flock G. Giguère V. Mol.

Therefore, Rev-erbα and Rev-erbβ have been proposed to link metabolism and inflammation to the circadian clock (5Duez H. Staels B. FEBS Lett. 2008; 582: 19-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 12Ramakrishnan S.N. Muscat G.E. Nucl. Recept. Signal. 2006; 4: e009Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Kovac J. Husse J. Oster H.

Because heme controls the activity of Rev-erb, understanding the regulation of heme binding is of special significance. Tip60 and ZNHIT-1 are involved in derepression of Rev-erbβ-regulated genes (e.g. apoCIII) (15Wang J. Liu N. Liu Z. Li Y. Song C. Yuan H. Li Y.Y. Zhao X. Lu H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1783: 224-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 16Wang J. Li Y. Zhang M. Liu Z. Wu C. Yuan H. Li Y.Y. Zhao X. Lu H. FEBS J. 2007; 274: 5370-5381Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar); however, what facilitates the derepression of Rev-erbα regulated genes is not known. In addition to its activity as a repressor, Rev-erbβ can also act as a transcriptional activator (17Ramakrishnan S.N. Lau P. Crowther L.M. Cleasby M.E. Millard S. Leong G.M. Cooney G.J. Muscat G.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2009; 388: 654-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Several recent studies have focused on the relationship between heme and Rev-erbs. Heme has long been implicated to play a key role in maintaining the circadian rhythm via binding to different circadian proteins such as NPAS2 and mPer2 (18Boehning D. Snyder S.H. Science. 2002; 298: 2339-2340Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 19Yang J. Kim K.D. Lucas A. Drahos K.E. Santos C.S. Mury S.P. Capelluto D.G. Finkielstein C.V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2008; 28: 4697-4711Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Correspondingly, heme shows a circadian pattern of expression (20Kaasik K. Lee C.C. Nature. 2004; 430: 467-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Rev-erbβ also has been recently shown to bind heme, and the x-ray crystal structure reveals Cys-384 and His-568 as axial ligands for the ferric heme (11Pardee K.I. Xu X. Reinking J. Schuetz A. Dong A. Liu S. Zhang R. Tiefenbach J. Lajoie G. Plotnikov A.N. Botchkarev A. Krause H.M. Edwards A. PLoS Biol. 2009; 7: e43Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), similar to the Drosophila homolog, E75 (21de Rosny E. de Groot A. Jullian-Binard C. Gaillard J. Borel F. Pebay-Peyroula E. Fontecilla-Camps J.C. Jouve H.M. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 9727-9734Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). A ligand switch appears to occur upon reduction of the Fe3+-heme to Fe2+ with His-568 proposed to remain as one of the Fe2+ ligands (22Marvin K.A. Reinking J.L. Lee A.J. Pardee K. Krause H.M. Burstyn J.N. Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 7056-7071Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Raman and magnetic CD data indicated the presence of one or two neutral ligands in the Fe2+ state (22Marvin K.A. Reinking J.L. Lee A.J. Pardee K. Krause H.M. Burstyn J.N. Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 7056-7071Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). An important attribute of heme-dependent proteins is their ability to bind gaseous signaling molecules (CO, NO, etc.) (23Ignarro L.J. Nitric Oxide: Biology and Pathobiology. Academic Press, San Diego, CA2000: 386-387Google Scholar, 24Wu L. Wang R. Pharmacol. Rev. 2005; 57: 585-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (739) Google Scholar). Like some other heme-dependent transcriptional regulators, Rev-erbβ appears to bind diatomic (CO/NO) gases (11Pardee K.I. Xu X. Reinking J. Schuetz A. Dong A. Liu S. Zhang R. Tiefenbach J. Lajoie G. Plotnikov A.N. Botchkarev A. Krause H.M. Edwards A. PLoS Biol. 2009; 7: e43Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar); however, the affinity has not been measured. Based on Raman and magnetic CD studies, it has been proposed that NO/CO replaces Cys-384 as an axial ligand and that a neutral ligand serves as the sixth ligand in the (CO/NO)-bound form of Rev-erbβ (11Pardee K.I. Xu X. Reinking J. Schuetz A. Dong A. Liu S. Zhang R. Tiefenbach J. Lajoie G. Plotnikov A.N. Botchkarev A. Krause H.M. Edwards A. PLoS Biol. 2009; 7: e43Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 22Marvin K.A. Reinking J.L. Lee A.J. Pardee K. Krause H.M. Burstyn J.N. Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 7056-7071Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Here, we show that a thiol-disulfide redox switch regulates binding of heme to the LBD of Rev-erbβ. Heme binds more tightly to the reduced dithiol state of Rev-erbβ, forming a complex with a dissociation constant that is similar to the low nanomolar intracellular concentration of free heme. Mass spectrometric and mutational analyses reveal that formation of the disulfide bond between Cys-384 and Cys-374 upon oxidation lowers the affinity for heme by ∼5-fold. UV-visible and EPR spectroscopic studies with the purified protein and with Escherichia coli cells expressing the Rev-erbβ LBD indicate that oxidation of Rev-erbβ also triggers a ligand switch converting His/Cys ligated heme to another six-coordinated heme ligated via His and an unknown neutral residue. Based on EPR spectra, the neutral ligand could be another His, Met, or Lys. Increasing the pH above 10 also converts the His/neutral residue ligation state of the oxidized protein to His/Cys ligation. Our results indicate that the thiol/disulfide redox switch (but not the ligand switch) regulates heme affinity. Thus, the present study demonstrates a mechanism by which the redox status of Rev-erbβ can alter heme binding and may facilitate its ability to regulate the cyclic expression of metabolic and proinflammatory genes in response to changes in intracellular redox conditions. In all experiments, the LBD (residues 247–579) of human Rev-erbβ was used. The wild-type Rev-erbβ LBD clone was generously provided by Thomas P. Burris (Scripps Research Institute, Jupiter, FL). The protein was expressed in a pET-46Ek/LIC vector as an N-terminal His6-tagged protein. All of the cysteines were kept intact in the protein unless otherwise specified. E. coli cells were grown without any heme supplement, unless otherwise stated. The protein was purified using a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column (Qiagen) and was then dialyzed against a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, 300 mm NaCl, and 10% glycerol, pH 8.0 (Buffer A). No significant amount of heme remained bound to the protein after overnight dialysis as was confirmed by the pyridine hemochrome assay (25Berry E.A. Trumpower B.L. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 161: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (746) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed as described previously (26Gupta N. Ragsdale S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 28721-28728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), and all of the clones were sequenced at the DNA Sequencing Core Facility (University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI). Throughout, we refer to the disulfide and dithiol states of the Rev-erbβ LBD when we describe the “oxidized” and “reduced” protein; the redox state of the heme, i.e. Fe3+ or Fe2+, is stated explicitly. To generate the fully reduced or fully oxidized form of the protein, the following methods were employed. To obtain the fully reduced protein, the Rev-erbβ LBD was first incubated with a 30-fold molar excess of tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP) for 30 min on ice, and then TCEP was removed on a Bio-Gel P-6 (Bio-Rad) column. Therefore, no TECP was present during the experiments with the reduced protein. The number of free thiols in the reduced Rev-erbβ LBD was quantified by an assay as described earlier (27Bulaj G. Kortemme T. Goldenberg D.P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8965-8972Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, 28Ellman G.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1958; 74: 443-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (930) Google Scholar, 29Yi L. Ragsdale S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 21056-21067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The TCEP treatment, incubation, chromatography, and assay were carried out inside an anaerobic chamber (Vacuum Atmospheres Co., Hawthorne, CA). Then the protein was transferred to anaerobically closed vials/cuvettes or EPR tubes, thus maintaining the reducing environment. To fully oxidize the protein, the reduced Rev-erbβ LBD was treated with 400 μm diamide; alternatively, the air-oxidized protein was used. Complete oxidation of thiols was verified by the 5,5′-dithio-bis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) assay before performing experiments with the oxidized protein. Heme titrations were performed by difference spectroscopy in a double beam spectrometer using 0.2–0.5 μm protein, as described earlier (29Yi L. Ragsdale S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 21056-21067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), except that the buffer contained Buffer B (20 mm Tris-HCl, 300 mm NaCl, and 10% glycerol, 3% Me2SO, pH 8.0). In these titrations, the blank cuvette contained buffer, the sample cuvette had both protein and buffer, and heme from a 50 μm stock solution was added to both cuvettes. Because heme solutions are prone to dimerization and oligomerization, special precautions, as described earlier (29Yi L. Ragsdale S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 21056-21067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), were taken in preparation of the stock heme solutions, e.g. by including Me2SO, which has been shown to prevent heme aggregation (30Kuzelová K. Mrhalová M. Hrkal Z. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1336: 497-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Briefly, hemin (Fe3+-heme) stocks were prepared fresh for each use by dissolving hemin (Sigma) in 0.1 m NaOH and 5% Me2SO, filtering with a 0.2-μm syringe filter (Amicon, Beverly, MA) and diluting to 50 μm by adding an aliquot into a solution of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 5% Me2SO, and 10% glycerol. To prepare Fe2+-heme, the Fe3+ in the 50 μm hemin stock solution was reduced by adding 2.5 mm sodium dithionite in the anaerobic chamber (Vacuum Atmospheres Co., Hawthorne, CA) and was handled anaerobically in vials and cuvettes that were sealed with rubber serum stoppers. To determine the binding parameters, the data obtained from the heme (21de Rosny E. de Groot A. Jullian-Binard C. Gaillard J. Borel F. Pebay-Peyroula E. Fontecilla-Camps J.C. Jouve H.M. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 9727-9734Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) titrations were plotted and fit to an equation describing a single binding site (Equation 1), which is quadratic and is used when the Kd value is similar to the concentration of protein, because it accounts for the amount of bound ligand in the solution (29Yi L. Ragsdale S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 21056-21067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Here, ΔA refers to the absorbance difference at 416, 424, and 428 nm between the sample (containing protein and added heme) and reference (containing only protein) cuvettes; Δϵ is defined as the difference in extinction coefficient between free and bound heme, and EL is the concentration of the heme-protein complex. EL was calculated from Equation 2, where E0 refers to the total protein concentration, L0 refers to the total heme concentration, and Kd refers to the dissociation constant. Thus, the lines shown in the heme titrations are all theoretical fits of the data (the symbols) to these equations.EL=0.5(E0+L0+Kd−((E0+L0+Kd)2−4E0*L0)1/2)(Eq. 1) ΔA=Δε*EL(Eq. 2) Surprisingly, for Rev-erbβ LBD, the apparent Kd value seemed to depend on the protein concentration. When the titration was performed at increasing concentrations of the oxidized protein (from 0.4 to 5 μm), the Kd value increased from 0.12 to 2 μm, the latter value being similar to values reported earlier (see above). Likewise, variation in concentration of reduced protein from 0.3 to 5 μm resulted in an increase in the Kd from 23 nm to 0.9 μm. It is likely that aggregation of Rev-erbβ at higher protein concentrations is responsible for this nonideal behavior in heme-binding experiments. It is also possible that this behavior results in part from aggregation of heme (31de Villiers K.A. Kaschula C.H. Egan T.J. Marques H.M. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 2007; 12: 101-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar); however, we took special precautions (preparing heme solutions and performing titrations in the presence of Me2SO (30Kuzelová K. Mrhalová M. Hrkal Z. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1336: 497-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar)) to minimize heme dimerization and aggregation. Correspondingly, native gel electrophoresis experiments with the oxidized LBD show high molecular weight species that are not present with the reduced protein or with reduced protein that has been freshly treated with diamide. When the concentration of the Rev-erbβ LBD was kept below 1 μm, Kd values in the 0.20 μm range for the oxidized protein and in the 23 nm range for the reduced protein were consistently observed. Thus, the high Kd values in the 2–6 μm range are likely to be artifactual. Furthermore, free heme concentrations in the cell are below 0.1 μm (32Garrick M.D. Scott D. Kulju D. Romano M.A. Dolan K.G. Garrick L.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1449: 125-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 33Liu S.C. Zhai S. Palek J. Blood. 1988; 71: 1755-1758Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Sassa S. J. Clin. Biochem. Nutr. 2006; 38: 138-155Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar), and free heme levels above 1 μm are toxic (34Sassa S. J. Clin. Biochem. Nutr. 2006; 38: 138-155Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Thus, we continued our experiments using protein concentrations below 1 μm. EPR spectra were recorded at 15 K on an X-band Bruker EMX spectrometer (Bruker Biospin Corp., Billerica, MA) containing an Oxford ITC4 temperature controller, a Hewlett-Packard model 5340 automatic frequency counter, and a Bruker gaussmeter. All of the EPR samples were prepared in Buffer A (see above). The samples were frozen with liquid nitrogen before the experiment. For in vivo detection of the Fe3+-heme complex with Rev-erb, whole cell EPR experiments were performed. E. coli cells expressing the Rev-erbβ LBD were grown overnight at 25 °C after induction with 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, and 10 ml of culture was centrifuged at 2977 × g for 10 min. The pellet obtained was resuspended in 100 μl of Buffer B, transferred to an EPR tube, and frozen in liquid nitrogen before obtaining the EPR spectrum. Samples of oxidized and reduced (with 10 mm TCEP) Rev-erbβ LBD (2 mg/ml) were subjected to a two-step alkylation protocol, as has been described previously (29Yi L. Ragsdale S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 21056-21067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Briefly, samples were first treated with iodoacetamide in a denaturing buffer and then with 4-vinyl pyridine after reduction with 10 mm TCEP. Alkylated Rev-erbβ LBD samples were digested with trypsin and analyzed by mass spectrometry in the Protein Structure Facility at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. LC-MS/MS was performed on a NanoAqcuity/Qtof Premier Instrument (Waters Inc., Milford, MA) (see supplemental methods for details). OxICAT, a novel mass spectrometric method that couples thiol trapping with the ICAT technique to quantify oxidative thiol modifications, was performed. For trapping the redox states of purified Rev-erbβ LBD, 100 μg of oxidized Rev-erbβ LBD was applied to a two-step alkylation procedure with light/heavy ICAT reagents as described previously (35Leichert L.I. Gehrke F. Gudiseva H.V. Blackwell T. Ilbert M. Walker A.K. Strahler J.R. Andrews P.C. Jakob U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 8197-8202Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar, 36Yang J. Ishimori K. O'Brian M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 7671-7676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The alkylated protein was then digested with trypsin, and the cysteine-containing peptides, which are linked to biotin, were enriched on a cation exchange cartridge followed by an avidin affinity cartridge (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The biotin tag, which was conjugated to the cysteine-containing peptides, was removed afterward, and then samples were analyzed by nano-liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry at the Michigan Proteome Consortium to quantify the amounts of reduced (dithiol) protein containing the light ICAT and oxidized (disulfide) protein containing the heavy ICAT adduct. For determining the redox state of cysteines in Rev-erbβ LBD, different peptides were analyzed containing the cysteine(s) of interest. As expected, the high resolution mass spectra consist of envelopes of multiple peaks reflecting the presence of 0.018% 2H, 1.11% 13C, 0.45% 15N, and 0.20% 18O in each peptide. The m/z ratios for the oxidized form of these peptides are 9 (for peptides containing single cysteine) and 18 (for the peptide with two cysteines) mass units larger than those for the reduced protein (37Gygi S.P. Rist B. Gerber S.A. Turecek F. Gelb M.H. Aebersold R. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 994-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (4350) Google Scholar). The protein was first dialyzed in 50 mm acetic acid, 50 mm MES, and 100 mm triethanolamine, pH 8.0 buffer (38Ellis K.J. Morrison J.F. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 87: 405-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar), and then the pH was adjusted with 10 n NaOH before performing UV-visible and EPR spectroscopy (as described above) at the desired pH. Rev-erbβ LBD samples were prepared anaerobically, treated with sodium dithionite (final concentration, 2.5 mm), and transferred anaerobically to the reaction cuvette. Aliquots of CO were added to the assay mixture from an anaerobic stock solution consisting of Buffer A that had been bubbled with a gas mixture of N2/CO (75%/25%, providing a CO concentration of 0.25 mm). Gas cylinders (25%) were purchased from Metro Welding Supply Corporation (Detroit, MI). The final concentration of CO in the CO-saturated buffer was confirmed by titration with myoglobin, whose concentration was determined based on its published extinction coefficient (121 mm−1 cm−1) (39Antonini E. Brunori M. Hemoglobin and Myoglobin in Their Rections with Ligands. North Holland Publishing Co., London1971: 43-47Google Scholar). Heme binding studies were performed with the oxidized and reduced forms (assessed by the 5,5′-dithio-bis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) assay as described under “Experimental Procedures”) of the purified LBD of Rev-erbβ and were monitored by difference UV-visible spectroscopy. All of the heme titrations were performed in Buffer A (see “Experimental Procedures” for details), unless stated otherwise. When the oxidized Rev-erbβ LBD was titrated with Fe3+-heme, the difference spectra exhibited absorbance changes in the Soret region at 416 nm (Fig. 1A) and in the alpha (567 nm) and beta (537 nm) bands. Titration of reduced Rev-erbβ LBD (after TCEP removal) with Fe3+-heme resulted in shifts in the Soret peak to 424 nm, and the alpha and beta peaks were at 570 and 542 nm (Fig. 1C), respectively, which is characteristic of His/Cys axial ligands (21de Rosny E. de Groot A. Jullian-Binard C. Gaillard J. Borel F. Pebay-Peyroula E. Fontecilla-Camps J.C. Jouve H.M. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 9727-9734Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 40Igarashi J. Kitanishi K. Martinkova M. Murase M. Iizuka A. Shimizu T. Acta Chim. Slov. 2008; 55: 67-74Google Scholar). The UV-visible spectra of the oxidized and reduced protein-heme complexes are shown in supplemental Fig. S1 and show similar peak shifts as observed in the difference spectra. The oxidized protein with bound Fe3+-heme has its Soret band at 415 nm, whereas two long wavelength peaks are at 566 and 534 nm. However, the TCEP-reduced protein containing bound Fe3+-heme exhibits a Soret peak at 424 nm and alpha and beta peaks at 571 and 541 nm, respectively. These spectral changes between the oxidized and reduced protein in the Fe3+-heme state indicate that a ligand switch is associated with oxidation/reduction of the Rev-erbβ LBD (this conclusion is verified by the mutagenesis and EPR studies described below). By plotting the change in absorbance at 416 nm (for the oxidized LBD) or at 424 nm (for the reduced protein) versus the concentration of added Fe3+-heme, typical hyperbolic profiles were obtained, indicating saturation binding. When the data for the oxidized protein were fit to Equation 1, the Kd value was 117 nm (Fig. 1B), significantly lower than the values of ∼2 μm (8Raghuram S. Stayrook K.R. Huang P. Rogers P.M.

PLoS Biol. 2009; 7: e43Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) reported earlier. Furthermore, the reduced protein binds Fe3+-heme even more tightly, with a Kd value of 23 nm (Fig. 1D). Because the crystal structure identified His-568 and Cys-384 as heme ligands, we performed heme titrations of the H568R, H568A, and C384A variants. The heme binding affinities of these variants, both in oxidized and reduced states, were significantly lower than those of the wild-type protein (see Table 3). The Kd for the complex between heme and the H468R variant is ∼20-fold higher than that for the H568A mutant, suggesting that this substitution many have an effect on the active site other than simply removal of the heme ligand.TABLE 3Redox-dependent heme binding properties of wild type and mutantsOxidized protein-Fe3+ hemeReduced prot"
https://openalex.org/W2152815720,"CC chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5) is a G-protein-coupled receptor for the chemokines CCL3, -4, and -5 and a coreceptor for entry of R5-tropic strains of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) into CD4(+) T-cells. We investigated the mechanisms whereby nonpeptidic, low molecular weight CCR5 ligands block HIV-1 entry and infection. Displacement binding assays and dissociation kinetics demonstrated that two of these molecules, i.e. TAK779 and maraviroc (MVC), inhibit CCL3 and the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein gp120 binding to CCR5 by a noncompetitive and allosteric mechanism, supporting the view that they bind to regions of CCR5 distinct from the gp120- and CCL3-binding sites. We observed that TAK779 and MVC are full and weak inverse agonists for CCR5, respectively, indicating that they stabilize distinct CCR5 conformations with impaired abilities to activate G-proteins. Dissociation of [(125)I]CCL3 from CCR5 was accelerated by TAK779, to a lesser extent by MVC, and by GTP analogs, suggesting that inverse agonism contributes to allosteric inhibition of the chemokine binding to CCR5. TAK779 and MVC also promote dissociation of [(35)S]gp120 from CCR5 with an efficiency that correlates with their ability to act as inverse agonists. Displacement experiments revealed that affinities of MVC and TAK779 for the [(35)S]gp120-binding receptors are in the same range (IC(50) ∼6.4 versus 22 nm), although we found that MVC is 100-fold more potent than TAK779 for inhibiting HIV infection. This suggests that allosteric CCR5 inhibitors not only act by blocking gp120 binding but also alter distinct steps of CCR5 usage in the course of HIV infection."
https://openalex.org/W1974953615,"La Crosse encephalitis virus (LACV) is a mosquito-borne member of the negative-strand RNA virus family Bunyaviridae. We have previously shown that the virulence factor NSs of LACV is an efficient inhibitor of the antiviral type I interferon system. A recombinant virus unable to express NSs (rLACVdelNSs) strongly induced interferon transcription, whereas the corresponding wt virus (rLACV) suppressed it. Here, we show that interferon induction by rLACVdelNSs mainly occurs through the signaling pathway leading from the pattern recognition receptor RIG-I to the transcription factor IRF-3. NSs expressed by rLACV, however, acts downstream of IRF-3 by specifically blocking RNA polymerase II-dependent transcription. Further investigations revealed that NSs induces proteasomal degradation of the mammalian RNA polymerase II subunit RPB1. NSs thereby selectively targets RPB1 molecules of elongating RNA polymerase II complexes, the so-called IIo form. This phenotype has similarities to the cellular DNA damage response, and NSs was indeed found to transactivate the DNA damage response gene pak6. Moreover, NSs expressed by rLACV boosted serine 139 phosphorylation of histone H2A.X, one of the earliest cellular reactions to damaged DNA. However, other DNA damage response markers such as up-regulation and serine 15 phosphorylation of p53 or serine 1524 phosphorylation of BRCA1 were not triggered by LACV infection. Collectively, our data indicate that the strong suppression of interferon induction by LACV NSs is based on a shutdown of RNA polymerase II transcription and that NSs achieves this by exploiting parts of the cellular DNA damage response pathway to degrade IIo-borne RPB1 subunits."
https://openalex.org/W2028597345,"Histone deacetylase (HDAC) 7 is a member of the HDAC family of deacetylases. Although some of the HDAC proteins have been shown to regulate neuronal survival and death, whether HDAC7 has a similar role is not known. In this study, we show that HDAC7 protects neurons from apoptosis. In cerebellar granule neurons (CGNs) primed to undergo apoptosis by low potassium treatment, expression of HDAC7 protein is reduced. Reduced expression is also observed in CGNs induced to die by pharmacological inhibition of the proteasome, in cortical neurons treated with homocysteic acid, and in the striatum of R6/2 transgenic mice, a commonly used genetic model of Huntington disease. Forced expression of HDAC7 in cultured CGNs blocks low potassium-induced death, and shRNA-mediated suppression of its expression induces death in otherwise healthy neurons. HDAC7-mediated neuroprotection does not require its catalytic domain and cannot be inhibited by chemical inhibitors of HDACs. Moreover, pharmacological inhibitors of the PI3K-Akt or Raf-MEK-ERK signaling pathways or that of PKA, PKC, and Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase fail to reduce neuroprotection by HDAC7. We show that stimulation of c-jun expression, an essential feature of neuronal death, is prevented by HDAC7. shRNA-mediated suppression of HDAC7 expression leads to an increase in c-jun expression. Inhibition of c-jun expression by HDAC7 is mediated at the transcriptional level by its direct association with the c-jun gene promoter. Taken together, our results indicate that HDAC7 is a neuroprotective protein acting by a mechanism that is independent of its deacetylase activity but involving the inhibition of c-jun expression.

Histone deacetylases (HDACs) 2The abbreviations used are: HDAC, histone deacetylase; CGN, cerebellar granule neurons; HCA, homocysteic acid; HK, high potassium; LK, low potassium; boc, t-butoxycarbonyl; fmk, fluoromethyl ketone; Z, benzyloxycarbonyl; CHX, cycloheximide; TSA, trichostatin acid A; ANOVA, analysis of variance; HDRP, histone deacetylase-related protein. are the catalytic subunits of multiprotein complexes that deacetylate specific lysines in the tail residues of histones, resulting in the compaction of chromatin into a transcriptionally repressed state (reviewed in Refs. 1Yang X.J. Seto E. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9: 206-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (959) Google Scholar, 2Haberland M. Montgomery R.L. Olson E.N. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2009; 10: 32-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (1928) Google Scholar). Although best studied for their effects on histones and transcriptional activity, it is now known that HDACs regulate the acetylation status of a number of other non-histone proteins, suggesting complex functions of HDACs (1Yang X.J. Seto E. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9: 206-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (959) Google Scholar, 2Haberland M. Montgomery R.L. Olson E.N. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2009; 10: 32-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (1928) Google Scholar). The 18 HDACs expressed in mammals have been grouped into four classes. Class I HDACs (HDAC1–3 and HDAC8) are composed primarily of a catalytic domain, expressed ubiquitously, and localize to the nucleus where they serve as transcriptional repressors. Class II HDACs (HDAC4–7, HDAC9, and HDAC10) are larger proteins with an N-terminal regulatory domain involved in protein-protein interactions. These HDACs are expressed tissue-specifically and can shuttle between the nucleus and the cytoplasm in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. HDAC11 is the sole member of the class IV HDAC subfamily. Members of the third class of deacetylases are called sirtuins (Sirt1–7). In contrast to proteins in the other three classes, which are zinc-dependent deacetylases, sirtuins are NAD-dependent enzymes. There is growing consensus that HDACs regulate neuronal survival and that deregulated HDAC activity contributes to the loss of neurons in neurodegenerative disorders (reviewed in Refs. 3D'Mello S.R. Drug News Perspect. 2009; 22: 513-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 4Kazantsev A.G. Thompson L.M. Nat. Rev.

Protection afforded by nonselective pharmacological inhibitors (inhibiting all HDAC proteins efficiently) in certain in vivo models of neurodegeneration has suggested that the activation of HDACs contributes to the promotion of neuronal death. However, because the HDAC inhibitors used in these studies block most HDACs effectively, the identity of the HDAC protein(s) responsible for promoting neurodegeneration remains unclear. Moreover, contrary to the conclusions drawn from the pharmacological studies, results obtained from the analysis of individual members of the HDAC family have revealed that several HDAC proteins, including HDAC1, HDAC4, HDAC6, HDRP (a truncated form of HDAC9), and Sirt1, protect neurons rather than promote degeneration (6Majdzadeh N.

We and others have previously reported that treatment of cultured cerebellar granule neurons (CGNs) with HDAC inhibitors induces apoptosis (7Morrison B.E. Majdzadeh N. Zhang X. Lyles A.

Neurotoxicity by HDAC inhibitors has also been observed in cortical neurons, although in comparison with CGNs, where an exposure of 4–6 h was sufficient to induce toxicity, a more long term exposure is required for neurotoxicity in cortical neurons (16Langley B. D'Annibale M.A. Suh K. Ayoub I. Tolhurst A. Bastan B. Yang L. Ko B. Fisher M. Cho S. Beal M.F. Ratan R.R. J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 163-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the treatment of CGNs with either of two distinct HDAC inhibitors, TSA and MS-275, leads to reduced expression of HDAC7 and HDRP (7Morrison B.E. Majdzadeh N. Zhang X. Lyles A. Bassel-Duby R. Olson E.N. D'Mello S.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 3550-3564Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Selective down-regulation of HDAC7 expression by another broad spectrum HDAC inhibitor, SAHA, has also been observed in a variety of normal, immortalized, genetically transformed, and human cancer-derived cell lines (17Benn C.L. Butler R. Mariner L. Nixon J. Moffitt H. Mielcarek M. Woodman B. Bates G.P. PLoS One. 2009; 4: e5747Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 18Dokmanovic M. Perez G. Xu W. Ngo L. Clarke C. Parmigiani R.B. Marks P.A. Mol. Cancer Ther. 2007; 6: 2525-2534Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Furthermore, administration of SAHA to mice results in the down-regulation of HDAC7 in the brain (17Benn C.L. Butler R. Mariner L. Nixon J. Moffitt H. Mielcarek M. Woodman B. Bates G.P. PLoS One. 2009; 4: e5747Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). These observations raise the possibility that elevated levels of HDAC7 are required for neuronal survival and that the neurotoxic effect of HDAC inhibitors on CGNs results from the reduction in HDAC7 expression. We investigated this possibility in this study. We report that HDAC7 is indeed capable of preventing neuronal death and does so in a deacetylase-independent manner. We provide evidence indicating that HDAC7-mediated neuroprotection is obtained by inhibition of c-jun expression, a transcription factor that plays a pivotal role in promoting neuronal death. Unless indicated otherwise, all cell culture media and reagents were purchased from Invitrogen, and all chemicals, including homocysteic acid (HCA) and cycloheximide (CHX), were from Sigma.

Antibodies used in this study were as follows: HDAC7 (sc-11412) and c-Jun (sc-1694) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA); cleaved caspase3 (9661) was from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA); HDAC4 (H0163), HDRP (H9163), FLAG (F-1804), and tubulin (T-5168) were from Sigma. All antibodies were used at a 1:1,000 dilution for Western blots. FLAG-tagged full-length HDAC7 and JC6-Luc, a luciferase vector containing −225/+150 fragment of the mouse c-jun promoter, were purchased from Addgene (Addgene, Cambridge, MA). FLAG-tagged C-terminally truncated HDAC7, HDAC7(1–519) (corresponding to amino acids 1–519), and FLAG-tagged N-terminally truncated HDAC7, HDAC7(514–953) (corresponding to amino acids 514–953) were obtained by PCR using the full-length HDAC7 plasmid as template and were subcloned into the p3F-CMV vector (Sigma). shHdac7-1 (TRCN0000039335) and shHdac7-2 (TRCN0000039337), two shRNA vectors targeting both rat and mouse HDAC7, were purchased from Sigma. pLKO.1, which has a no-hairpin 18-bp insert and serves as shRNA control, was obtained from Addgene (Addgene, Cambridge, MA). CGNs were cultured from dissociated cerebella of 7–8-day-old Wistar rats as described previously (6Majdzadeh N. Wang L. Morrison B.E. Bassel-Duby R. Olson E.N. D'Mello S.R. Dev.

In short, processed CGNs were plated in basal Eagle's medium with Earle's salts (BME) supplemented with 10% FBS, 25 mm KCl, 2 mm glutamine (Invitrogen), and 100 μg/ml gentamicin. Cells were plated on dishes coated with poly-l-lysine at a density of 106 cells/well (24-well dishes) and 107 cells/60-mm dishes. 10 μm cytosine arabinofuranoside was added to the culture medium 18–22 h after plating to prevent proliferation of non-neuronal cells. Cells were then maintained for 4–5 days in 24-well dishes prior to transient transfection experiments. Transfection of CGNs was done as described previously (6Majdzadeh N. Wang L. Morrison B.E.

Cell culture medium of neurons was changed to DMEM without l-glutamine after one wash. Precipitated DNA was added to the cell culture medium for 30 min. Cells were then washed twice with DMEM without l-glutamine medium and placed in their original medium. A day after transfection, the cells were rinsed once and then maintained in serum-free BME medium containing either 5 mm KCl (low potassium, LK) or 25 mm KCl (high potassium, HK). Pharmacological inhibitors (dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide) were added in HK or LK conditions at the time of treating. Time of treatments are described in the figure legends. Transfected neurons were detected by immuno-staining using FLAG antibody or GFP antibody as described previously (6Majdzadeh N. Wang L. Morrison B.E. Bassel-Duby R. Olson E.N. D'Mello S.R. Dev.

For immunocytochemistry, antibodies purchased from Sigma were used at a 1:200 dilution and antibodies from Santa Cruz Biotechnology at a 1:100 dilution. Neuronal viability was quantified by staining cell nuclei with 4′,6′-diamidino-2-phenylindole hydrochloride (DAPI), which is widely used and well accepted to detect apoptosis in cerebellar granule neurons, as described previously (6Majdzadeh N.

PLoS ONE. 2008; 3: e4090Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The morphology change of chromatin condensation or nuclear fragmentation is well known as a hallmark of apoptosis. Cells with condensed or fragmented nuclei were counted as dead, and cells with rounded and less stained nuclei were counted as living. In each individual experiment, more than 100 transfected cells were counted for each treatment. Cell viability data are presented as mean values plus standard deviations from at least three separate experiments. Statistical significance was determined by using the Student's t test. p values <0.05 were deemed significant. Cortical neurons were cultured from the cerebral cortex of E17 Wistar rats as described previously (19Chen H.M. Wang L. D'Mello S.R. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 2003-2016Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). One day after plating, cells were transfected by calcium-phosphate precipitation as described above. Transfected cells were subjected to 1 mm HCA treatment for 16 h or 10 μm Aβ peptide for 48 h. Cell viability was quantified as described above. CGNs were transfected with shHdac7-1, shHdac7-2, or control vector pLKO.1. GFP was cotransfected to label transfected cells. Two days after transfection, cells were fixed and subjected to immunocytochemistry with a mouse anti-GFP and a rabbit anti-c-Jun as primary antibodies followed by goat anti-mouse conjugated with FITC (green) and goat anti-rabbit conjugated with Texas red (red) as secondary antibodies. c-Jun fluorescence images were taken by a Nikon eclipse 80i fluorescence microscope with a CCD camera using the same magnification and exposure time. Transfected cells were identified by GFP staining. The c-Jun fluorescent signals in transfected cells were quantified by calculating the mean pixels of the transfected cells on the unprocessed fluorescent images using the histogram function in Adobe Photoshop CS2 (20Kundel M. Jones K.J. Shin C.Y. Wells D.G. J. Neurosci. 2009; 29: 13630-13639Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). To correct for background fluorescence, the pixel intensity of the same size area was measured immediately adjacent to the transfected cell, and this value was subtracted. For each individual experiment, about 100 transfected cells from each group were subjected to c-Jun fluorescence quantification. Results are from three independent experiments. The mouse HT-22 neuroblastoma cell line was from ATCC (Manassas, VA) and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) with 4.5 g/liter glucose (without sodium pyruvate) supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. HT-22 cells were transfected with GFP or HDAC7 plasmid by Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) for 24 h. To induce apoptosis, HCA was added at a final concentration of 1 mm as described previously (6Majdzadeh N. Wang L. Morrison B.E. Bassel-Duby R. Olson E.N. D'Mello S.R. Dev.

Time of treatments are described in the figure legends. RNA was extracted from cultured neurons or HT-22 cells by using TRIzol (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions (6Majdzadeh N.

PLoS ONE. 2008; 3: e4090Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Three micrograms of total RNA from each sample was reverse-transcribed by ThermoScript reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) system (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. PCR was performed with PCR master mix (Promega). The primers used for PCR amplification were as follows: c-jun forward, 5′-TGGGCACATCACCACTACAC-3′, and c-jun reverse, 5′-AGTTGCTGAGGTTGGCGTA-3′; hdac7 forward, 5′-AGCCAGACACACCAGGCTCT-3′, and hdac7 reverse, 5′-GCTGCTACTACTGGGGGAGGA-3′; β-actin forward, 5′-AGGACTCCTATGTGGGTGACGA-3′, and β-actin reverse, 5′-CGTTGCCAATAGTGATGACCTG-3′. The culture medium was removed, and the cells were washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and lysed in lysis buffer (1% Triton, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm Na2EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1× protease inhibitor mixture). Protein concentrations were measured and normalized using Bradford protein assay reagent (Bio-Rad). After normalization, 60 μg of protein was subjected to Western blotting. Immunoreactivity was examined by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). c-jun promoter activity was determined by luciferase assay. HT-22 cells were transfected with JC6-Luc, the c-jun promoter luciferase vector, with or without HDAC7-FLAG by using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). One day after transfection, cells were treated with 1 mm HCA for 6 h. Cells were harvested, and c-jun promoter activity was determined by using Monolight enhanced luciferase assay kit (BD Biosciences) following the manufacturer's instructions. ChIP assays were carried out using a kit from Upstate and the protocol provided by the manufacturer as described previously (7Morrison B.E. Majdzadeh N. Zhang X. Lyles A. Bassel-Duby R. Olson E.N. D'Mello S.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 3550-3564Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Briefly, cell cultures were fixed by the addition of formaldehyde to a final concentration of 1% and incubated for 10 min at 37 °C. The medium was aspirated, and cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS. Cells were then harvested and lysed in 200 μl of SDS lysis buffer per 106 cells (1% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.1). Each 200-μl aliquot of lysate was sonicated with three pulses of 10 s at 30% power. Samples were diluted 1:10 in ChIP dilution buffer (Upstate Cell Signaling Solutions) and followed by immunoprecipitation with FLAG or HDAC7 antibody. Immunocomplex was washed and then eluted by the addition of 200 μl of elution buffer (1% SDS, 0.1 m NaHCO3). DNA-protein cross-links were reversed by adding 8 μl of 5 m NaCl and incubating at 65 °C for 4 h. Protein was degraded by the addition of 4 μl of 0.5 m EDTA, 8 μl of 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.5, and 10 μg of proteinase K followed by incubation for 1 h at 45 °C. Samples were then phenol/chloroform-extracted, and nucleic acids were precipitated with ethanol and subjected to PCR. Sequences of primer designed to detect a 174-bp fragment of c-jun promoter are as follows: forward, 5′-CTAGACAGCCAAACCAAGAC-3′; and reverse, 5′-GCTCACGGGATGAGGTAAT-3′. Breeding pairs of R6/2 mice made up of an ovarian transplant hemizygote female and a B6CBAF1/J male, both on a C57BL/6J background strain, were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). The breeding pairs were maintained and crossed at the institutional animal care facility. All animals had unlimited access to water and food and were maintained in a 12-h light/12-h dark cycle. Experimental procedures were performed in accordance with National Institutes of Health guidelines. Genotyping of litters was performed 10–14 days after birth by PCR of tail tip DNA. At 6 weeks after birth, mice homozygous for the transgene (R6/2tg/tg) and wild-type littermates were sacrificed by carbon dioxide inhalation. The brains were dissected, and the striatum was separated. The rest of the brain tissue was termed as extra-striatal tissue. RNA or protein lysates were prepared from striatal and nonstriatal tissue and used for RT-PCR or Western blotting as described above. The treatment of cultured CGNs with pharmacological inhibitors of HDACs induces apoptosis (7Morrison B.E. Majdzadeh N. Zhang X. Lyles A. Bassel-Duby R. Olson E.N. D'Mello S.R. Mol. Cell.

We previously reported (7Morrison B.E. Majdzadeh N. Zhang X. Lyles A. Bassel-Duby R. Olson E.N. D'Mello S.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 3550-3564Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) that the expression of HDAC7 is sharply down-regulated in neurons treated with HDAC inhibitors, TSA, and sodium butyrate. To examine whether HDAC7 expression was also reduced by apoptotic stimuli other than HDAC inhibitors, we treated CGNs with LK, a commonly used mode of inducing apoptosis in these neurons. LK treatment did not have any effect on the hdac7 mRNA expression (Fig. 1A). The level of HDAC7 protein, however, was dramatically reduced within 6 h of LK treatment (Fig. 1B). Multiple HDAC7 bands are observed in CGN lysates, all of which are reduced, albeit to differing extents. A similar pattern of HDAC7 immunoreactivity (multiple bands) was observed with another antibody generated against a different epitope (data not shown). It is unclear whether the multiple bands represent different isoforms of HDAC7 or whether they are proteolytic products or post-translational modifications. The dramatic reduction of HDAC7 protein in LK-treated neurons suggested that HDAC7 protein, but not hdac7 mRNA, is relatively unstable. To examine this issue further, we measured the half-life of HDAC7 protein in CGNs using CHX to block protein synthesis. HDAC7 protein level decreased ∼35% within 1 h of CHX treatment and over 50% by 3 h (Fig. 1C) confirming that HDAC7 is a relatively unstable protein, at least in neurons. Protein degradation is most commonly mediated through the ubiquitin-proteasome system. To examine if neuronal death-associated reduction of HDAC7 was due to proteasomal degradation, we treated neurons with MG132, a potent and widely used ubiquitin-proteasome system inhibitor. Interestingly, and as described by others (22Butts B.D. Hudson H.R. Linseman D.A. Le S.S. Ryan K.R. Bouchard R.J. Heidenreich K.A. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2005; 30: 279-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), treatment with MG132 by itself induced death of otherwise healthy CGNs (Fig. 2A). As shown in Fig. 2B, the level of HDAC7 protein was also reduced by MG132 treatment. This result indicates that the reduction of HDAC7 is not due to proteasomal degradation. In cells such as T lymphocytes, activation of the extrinsic cell death machinery with tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand or FasL leads to the proteolysis of HDAC7 by caspase-8 (23Scott F.L. Fuchs G.J. Boyd S.E. Denault J.B. Hawkins C.J. Dequiedt F. Salvesen G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 19499-19510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Treatment with pan-caspase inhibitors such as Z-VAD-fmk inhibits tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand or Fas-induced proteolysis of HDAC7 (23Scott F.L. Fuchs G.J. Boyd S.E.

Although death of CGNs by LK treatment is caspase-independent (24Miller T.M. Moulder K.L. Knudson C.M. Creedon D.J. Deshmukh M. Korsmeyer S.J. Johnson Jr., E.M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 205-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar, 25D'Mello S.R. Kuan C.Y. Flavell R.A. Rakic P. J. Neurosci. Res. 2000; 59: 24-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), we investigated whether the reduction of HDAC7 was due to proteolysis by caspases such as caspase-8. However, as shown in Fig. 2C, treatment with either of two separate pan-caspase inhibitors, Z-VAD-fmk and boc-Asp-fmk, had no effect on the LK-induced reduction of HDAC7 protein, although both inhibitors blocked caspase activation. This suggests that the reduction of HDAC7 protein levels is not due to caspase-mediated proteolytic degradation. Because reduced expression of HDAC7 was associated with neuronal death, we examined whether forced expression of HDAC7 could be neuroprotective. As shown in Fig. 3A, LK treatment of CGNs led to a loss of ∼50% of the neurons within 24 h. Forced expression of HDAC7 in LK-treated neurons offered almost complete protection (Fig. 3A). Although also present in the nucleus, 3C. Ma and S. R D'Mello, unpublished data. ectopically expressed HDAC7 is predominantly cytoplasmic in healthy CGNs. Upon switching from HK to LK medium, however, cytoplasmic HDAC7 translocated to the nucleus (Fig. 3B) suggesting that neuroprotection is mediated within the nucleus. To examine the versatility of HDAC7-mediated neuroprotection, we treated cortical neurons with Aβ peptide. Strong protection by HDAC7 was also observed in this commonly used cell culture model of Alzheimer disease (Fig. 3C). Furthermore, forced expression of HDAC7 protected primary cortical neurons from HCA-induced toxicity (Fig. 3D). Taken together, our results demonstrate that an elevated level of HDAC7 is protective against diverse neurotoxic stimuli. Although our results demonstrate that forced expression of HDAC7 protects CGNs, they do not show that the down-regulation of endogenous HDAC7 following LK treatment is causally involved in promoting neuronal death. To examine this issue, we suppressed HDAC7 expression using two shR"
https://openalex.org/W1989296948,"Osteoblasts and adipocytes are derived from common mesenchymal progenitor cells. The bone loss of osteoporosis is associated with altered progenitor differentiation from an osteoblastic to an adipocytic lineage. cDNA microarrays and quantitative real-time PCR (Q-PCR) were carried out in a differentiating mouse stromal osteoblastic cell line, Kusa 4b10, to identify gene targets of factors that stimulate osteoblast differentiation including parathyroid hormone (PTH) and gp130-binding cytokines, oncostatin M (OSM) and cardiotrophin-1 (CT-1). Zinc finger protein 467 (Zfp467) was rapidly down-regulated by PTH, OSM, and CT-1. Retroviral overexpression and RNA interference for Zfp467 in mouse stromal cells showed that this factor stimulated adipocyte formation and inhibited osteoblast commitment compared with controls. Regulation of adipocyte markers, including peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) γ, C/EBPα, adiponectin, and resistin, and late osteoblast/osteocyte markers (osteocalcin and sclerostin) by Zfp467 was confirmed by Q-PCR. Intra-tibial injection of calvarial cells transduced with retroviral Zfp467 doubled the number of marrow adipocytes in C57Bl/6 mice compared with vector control-transduced cells, providing in vivo confirmation of a pro-adipogenic role of Zfp467. Furthermore, Zfp467 transactivated a PPAR-response element reporter construct and recruited a histone deacetylase complex. Thus Zfp467 is a novel co-factor that promotes adipocyte differentiation and suppresses osteoblast differentiation. This has relevance to therapeutic interventions in osteoporosis, including PTH-based therapies currently available, and may be of relevance for the use of adipose-derived stem cells for tissue engineering."
https://openalex.org/W2005747478,"Palmitoylation is a lipid modification that confers diverse functions to target proteins and is a contributing factor for many neuronal diseases. In this study, we demonstrate using [(3)H]palmitic acid labeling and acyl-biotinyl exchange that native and expressed dopamine transporters (DATs) are palmitoylated, and using the palmitoyl acyltransferase inhibitor 2-bromopalmitate (2BP), we identify several associated functions. Treatment of rat striatal synaptosomes with 2BP using lower doses or shorter times caused robust inhibition of transport V(max) that occurred with no losses of DAT protein or changes in DAT surface levels, indicating that acute loss of palmitoylation leads to reduction of transport kinetics. Treatment of synaptosomes or cells with 2BP using higher doses or longer times resulted in DAT protein losses and production of transporter fragments, implicating palmitoylation in regulation of transporter degradation. Site-directed mutagenesis indicated that palmitoylation of rat DAT occurs at Cys-580 at the intracellular end of transmembrane domain 12 and at one or more additional unidentified site(s). Cys-580 mutation also led to production of transporter degradation fragments and to increased phorbol ester-induced down-regulation, further supporting palmitoylation in opposing DAT turnover and in opposing protein kinase C-mediated regulation. These results identify S-palmitoylation as a major regulator of DAT properties that could significantly impact acute and long term dopamine transport capacity."

Cytokines represent the key immune mediators that trigger a cascade of reactions that drive processes such as angiogenesis and proteolytic damage to tissues. IL-17 has now been shown to be a pivotal cytokine in many autoimmune diseases, supplanting the traditional Th1-Th2 paradigm. Also, the dual role of proinflammatory IFN-γ has unraveled new complexities in the cytokine biology of such disorders. A major hurdle in fully understanding the effector pathways in these disorders is the lack of information regarding the temporal kinetics of the cytokines during the course of the disease, as well as the interplay among the key cytokines. Using an experimental model of arthritic inflammation, we demonstrate that the temporal expression of cytokines during the incubation phase is a critical determinant of disease susceptibility. The susceptible rats raised a vigorous IL-17 response early, followed by IFN-γ and IL-27 response in that sequence, whereas the resistant rats displayed an early and concurrent response to these three cytokines. Accordingly, treatment with exogenous IFN-γ/IL-27 successfully controlled arthritic inflammation and inhibited the defined mediators of inflammation, angiogenesis, cell survival, apoptosis, and tissue damage. Furthermore, IFN-γ enhanced IL-27 secretion, revealing a cooperative interplay between the two cytokines.

Our results demonstrate a regulatory anti-inflammatory role of IL-27 and IFN-γ in AA, as well as a novel cooperative interaction between IFN-γ and IL-27 such that IFN-γ up-regulates IL-27. These cytokine-driven events in turn influence the key biochemical mediators of inflammatory arthritis. These results are of significance in advancing the mechanistic understanding of the pathogenesis of autoimmune arthritis. Lewis (LEW/Hsd, RT.11) and Wistar Kyoto (WKY/NHsd, RT.11) rats were purchased from Harlan Sprague-Dawley and housed in the vivarium of the University of Maryland School of Medicine (Baltimore, MD). Male rats (4–6 weeks old) were used in this study, and these rats were treated according to the guidelines of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Maryland School of Medicine. Lewis rats were immunized subcutaneously at the base of the tail with 1 mg/rat heat-killed Mtb H37Ra (Difco, Detroit, MI) suspended in oil (Sigma). Thereafter, these rats were observed regularly and graded for the severity of arthritis on the basis of erythema and swelling of the paws on a scale of 0–4 as described previously (19Moudgil K.D. Chang T.T. Eradat H. Chen A.M. Gupta R.S. Brahn E. Sercarz E.E. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 1307-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 41Durai M. Gupta R.S. Moudgil K.D. J. Immunol. 2004; 172: 2795-2802Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Different phases of AA were labeled as follows: incubation (Inc), onset (Ons), peak, and recovery phase. In most of the experiments, these phases corresponded to the day after Mtb immunization as follows: early incubation, day 3; late incubation, day 5; Ons, day 9; peak, day 18; and recovery, day 24. Lewis rats were immunized with Mtb, and 3 days later, subgroups of these rats received two to three injections (intraperitoneal) on alternate days of a particular cytokine, namely IL-17 (3 μg/rat; Shenandoah Biotechnology Inc.), IFN-γ (3 μg/rat; PeproTech), or IL-27 (2 μg/rat; R&D Systems). Control rats received equal amount of PBS instead of the cytokine. Mtb-immunized rats were injected with IFN-γ (3 μg/rat) or IL-27 (2 μg/rat) after the onset of arthritis. Control rats were injected with PBS. Thereafter, all rats were observed regularly for signs of arthritis, and the disease was graded as described above. Mtb-immunized Lewis rats were killed at different phases of AA, and their draining lymph nodes (para-aortic, inguinal, and popliteal) were harvested. For comparison, LNC of WKY rats immunized with Mtb were harvested at the time points corresponding to different phases of AA in Lewis rats. Thereafter, a single-cell suspension of LNC was prepared, and the cells were washed three times with Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS; Invitrogen). These LNC were cultured (2.5 × 105 cells/well) in a flat-bottomed 96-well plate in HL-1 serum-free medium (Ventrex Laboratories, Portland, ME) supplemented with 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin G sodium, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate in an atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2. The cells were restimulated with antigen for different time points (6–72 h) (supplemental Fig. S1) in the presence or absence of a cytokine. In some experiments, culture supernatants of LNC were collected for analysis by Multiplex assay (University of Maryland Baltimore Cytokine Core Facility). Spleens were harvested from arthritic Lewis rats at different phases of AA. For comparison, spleens of WKY rats immunized with Mtb were harvested at the corresponding time points. Thereafter, a single-cell suspension of spleen cells was prepared, and the cells were washed three times with HBSS. These spleen cells were cultured in 60 × 15-mm culture dishes (Corning, Inc., Corning, NY) at 37 °C in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 5% FBS, 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin G sodium, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate. After 90 min, the nonadherent cells were removed by washing with HBSS, yielding the SAC (41Durai M. Gupta R.S. Moudgil K.D. J. Immunol. 2004; 172: 2795-2802Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). These SAC (∼1.5–2.0 × 106 cells/dish) were restimulated with sonicated Mtb (10 μg/ml) for different time points (3–12 h) (supplemental Fig. S2) in the presence or absence of a cytokine. Hind paws of Mtb-immunized Lewis rats were removed at the peak phase of the disease, and SIC were collected by opening the joint using a sterile surgical blade. These SIC (total SIC) were washed three times with HBSS and then distributed equally into 60 × 15-mm culture dishes. This was followed by restimulation of SIC with antigen in serum-free HL-1 medium for 24 h. For adherent cells, the total SIC were cultured for 90 min in a 60 × 15-mm dish in RPMI 1640 medium containing 5% FBS. The nonadherent cells were removed by washing the culture dish with HBSS. The remaining cells (adherent SIC) were restimulated for 6 h with Mtb (10 μg/ml) in RPMI 1640 medium containing 5% FBS. SIC were collected from arthritic Lewis rats as described above and cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin G sodium, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate. After overnight incubation, the culture medium was replaced with fresh medium to remove nonadherent cells. Thereafter, the remaining adherent cells were split after they reached confluence, and cells in passage 2 were stimulated for 24 h with different concentrations of IFN-γ, IL-17, and IL-27 in serum-free medium. The supernatant was collected and analyzed for matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activity using a gelatin zymogram and for VEGF using an ELISA kit (University of Maryland, Baltimore Cytokine Core Facility). RNA was isolated from LNC, SAC, and SIC using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), and then cDNA was prepared from RNA using an iScript cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad). The resultant cDNA was used for analysis of mRNA expression levels of different cytokines as described below. Appropriate primers (synthesized at the University of Maryland, Baltimore Biopolymer Core Facility) were designed using the Primer Express 2.0 program (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) for the detection of mRNAs for IFN-γ, IL-6, IL-10, IL-17, IL-23p19, IL-27p28, IL-12p35, IL-12p40, TGF-β1, MMP9, and hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase. The cDNA prepared from the RNA that was obtained from cells was amplified in an ABI Prism 7900HT cycler (Applied Biosystems) by qRT-PCR using SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems). The mRNA levels of the genes of interest were normalized to the hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase gene, and the relative gene expression levels were determined. “-Fold increase” over mRNA levels of untreated cells was then determined. In our preliminary experiments using this method of cytokine testing, we had observed a clear correlation between mRNA and protein for IL-17, IFN-γ, and IL-10 (supplemental Fig. S3, A–F). Henceforth, for brevity, we will refer to cytokine mRNA expression as cytokine. LNC obtained from Mtb-immunized Lewis rats were restimulated (in a 6-well plate) for 24 h with antigen in the presence or absence of a cytokine. These cells were lysed using cell lysis buffer (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA). The supernatants were cleared by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 10 min, and their protein concentration was determined by BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). These supernatants (25 μg of protein) were used in Western blotting with rabbit anti-phospho-STAT3 and anti-ROR-γt antibodies (Cell Signaling Technology). LNC of IFN-γ- or IL-27-treated animals were restimulated with antigen for 24 h. Thereafter, RNA was collected for IL-17 mRNA expression studies. Cell lysates were used to study ROR-γt and phospho-STAT3 levels using Western blotting. FLS at passage 2 (in a 30-mm dish) were first starved for 6 h in serum-free medium and then stimulated for 30 min with different concentrations of IFN-γ, IL-17, or IL-27. Thereafter, these cells were sonicated briefly in a cell lysis buffer and protein content of the lysate was estimated. The proteins (25 μg) in the lysate were separated by 4–20% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto a PVDF membrane. The membrane was first blocked with 5% milk in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween and then probed with rabbit antibodies (anti-phospho-ERK and anti-phospho-Akt; Cell Signaling Technology) (Akt is “thymoma viral proto-oncogene”; synonymous with protein kinase B). Secondary anti-rabbit antibody (Pierce) was used at 1:1000 dilution. The membrane was reprobed with antibody against total ERK (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) or total Akt. GAPDH was used as a protein loading control. Protein bands were visualized with SuperSignal West Dura chemiluminescent detection reagents (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Rockford, IL) according to the manufacturer's directions. A zymogram assay was carried out as described previously (42Hembry R.M. Atkinson S.J. Murphy G. Methods Mol. Med. 2007; 135: 227-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Briefly, supernatant from FLS treated with IL-17, IFN-γ, or IL-27 was loaded onto a gelatin-coated, precasted polyacrylamide gel (Bio-Rad). Standard MMP9 and MMP2 (Sigma) were used as positive controls. Electrophoresis was carried out under SDS nonreducing conditions at constant voltage. The gel was incubated with 2.5% Triton X-100 at room temperature for 1–2 h to remove SDS. The gel was then washed three to four times with water to remove Triton X-100 and incubated overnight at 37 °C in developing buffer (Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) containing 5 mm CaCl2, 0.2 m NaCl, and 0.02% Brij 35. Thereafter, the gel was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. The metalloprotease activity was visualized and scanned using a scanner after destaining. FLS (25,000/well) were cultured in a black 96-well plate with a clear bottom in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS. The next day, the culture medium was replaced with DMEM without FBS, and the cells were stimulated for 12 h with IFN-γ, IL-17, or IL-27 (20 ng/ml). Thereafter, caspase-3/7 activity was assayed using the SensoLyte homogeneous AMC caspase-3/7 assay kit (AnaSpec, La Jolla, CA). Cells and assay reagents were mixed according to the manufacturer's recommendation and then incubated for an additional 24 h on a plate shaker at room temperature. The fluorescence of 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin released as a result of caspase action on N-acetyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin substrate was measured using a plate reader at excitation/emission of 360/460 nm, and results are presented as relative fluorescence units. Cytokine mRNA levels of Lewis and WKY rats at the corresponding time points (see Fig. 1) were analyzed by Student's t test. MMP9 mRNA expression, VEGF data, and cytokine mRNA (Fig. 2) were analyzed by repeated measures of analysis of variance with Dunnett's multiple comparison tests. IL-17 expression in Fig. 3 and caspase-3/7 activity were analyzed by Student's t test, whereas two-way analysis of variance with the Bonferroni post-test was carried out for in vivo experiments. A p value of <0.05 was considered to be significant. Data are presented as mean ± S.E. from at least three independent experiments.FIGURE 2Cross-regulation among cytokines.

The cDNA from these cells was used to quantify the mRNA expression of IL-17 (A–C), whereas the culture supernatant was used to determine the level of IL-17 protein by Multiplex (D and E).

In view of the importance of the draining lymph nodes in the initiation of immune responses leading to disease induction following an arthritogenic challenge (14Kim E.Y. Chi H.H. Bouziane M. Gaur A. Moudgil K.D. Clin. Immunol. 2008; 127: 98-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), we tested the whole LNC population to gain an insight into the in vivo cytokine milieu in that lymphoid tissue. In parallel, we probed the profiles of dendritic cell/macrophage cytokines (IL-27 (p28 subunit), IL-6, IL-12p35, IL-12p40, and IL-23 (p19 subunit)) in SAC stimulated with sonicated Mtb (Fig. 1C and supplemental Fig. S4). In Lewis rats, IL-17 was highest at the Inc phase, followed by a rapid decline at the onset of AA and thereafter (Fig. 1A). In contrast, IFN-γ (Fig. 1B) followed the disease profile, and its highest level was observed at the peak phase of the disease. IL-27 showed a small but gradual increase, peaking at the recovery phase (Fig. 1C). However, IL-10 (Fig. 1D) had a profile similar to that of IL-17 except for much less decline after the Inc phase. In WKY rats, the profiles of IL-17, IFN-γ, and IL-27 were almost identical, and each of these cytokines reached its peak level at the Inc phase. However, IL-10 was unchanged throughout the disease course. For the remaining SAC cytokines, in Lewis rats, IL-6 showed a gradual increase, and in WKY rats, IL-12p40 followed the pattern of IFN-γ response. However, IL-23 did not display a clear relation either with the disease course (Lewis) or with the time after Mtb injection (WKY) (supplemental Fig. S4). To examine the interplay among IL-17 and IFN-γ/IL-27, Mtb-primed LNC from Lewis rats were harvested at the Ons phase of AA and restimulated with Bhsp65 in the presence or absence of IFN-γ, anti-IFN-γ/isotype control antibody, IL-27, or IL-17. Significantly reduced IL-17 mRNA (Fig. 2A and C), as well as IL-17 protein (Fig. 2, D and E), was evident following the addition of IFN-γ or IL-27, whereas enhanced IL-17 mRNA was observed in the presence of anti-IFN-γ antibody (Fig. 2B). The suppressive action of IFN-γ and IL-27 on IL-17 expression was further validated by testing the levels of ROR-γt and phosphorylated STAT3, which are required for Th17 differentiation and IL-17 production. Interestingly, both IFN-γ and IL-27 reduced the level of ROR-γt (Fig. 2F) but had a differential effect on the phosphorylated STAT3 level, with IL-27 decreasing but IFN-γ increasing it at higher cytokine concentration (Fig. 2F). However, no significant additive or synergistic effect of IFN-γ and IL-27 on IL-17 mRNA suppression was observed (supplemental Fig. S5A). Moreover, the addition of IL-27 to LNC increased neither IFN-γ (supplemental Fig. S5B) nor IL-10 (supplemental Fig. S5C). Similarly, IL-17 failed to suppress IFN-γ expression (supplemental Fig. S5D). Thus, the cytokine cross-regulatory effect was unidirectional, with IFN-γ/IL-27 suppressing IL-17. We also examined the effect of IFN-γ and IL-17 on cytokine expression in Mtb-restimulated SAC representing antigen-presenting cells. Interestingly, IFN-γ up-regulated IL-27 significantly in the presence as well as the absence of Mtb (Fig. 2G), but it down-regulated TGF-β"

Programmed cell death and regulation of apoptosis in response to a viral infection are important factors for host or virus survival. It is not known whether Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) infection regulates the apoptosis process in vitro. This study for the first time suggests that CCHFV induces apoptosis, which may be dependent on caspase-3 activation. This study also shows that the coding sequence of the S segment of CCHFV contains a proteolytic cleavage site, DEVD, which is conserved in all CCHFV strains. By using different recombinant expression systems and site-directed mutagenesis, we demonstrated that this motif is subject to caspase cleavage. We also demonstrate that CCHFV nucleocapsid protein (NP) is cleaved into a 30-kDa fragment at the same time as caspase activity is induced during infection. Using caspase inhibitors and cells lacking caspase-3, we clearly demonstrate that the cleavage of NP is caspase-3-dependent. We also show that the inhibition of apoptosis induced progeny viral titers of ∼80–90%. Thus, caspase-3-dependent cleavage of NP may represent a host defense mechanism against lytic CCHFV infection. Taken together, these data suggest that the most abundant protein of CCHFV, which has several essential functions such as protection of viral RNA and participation in various processes in the replication cycle, can be subjected to cleavage by host cell caspases.

We determined that SP-A binds S. aureus through the extracellular adhesin Eap. Consequently, SP-A enhanced macrophage uptake of Eap-expressing (Eap+) but not Eap-deficient (Eap−) S. aureus. In a reciprocal fashion, SP-A failed to enhance uptake of Eap+ S. aureus in peritoneal Raw264.7 macrophages with a dominant negative mutation (SP-R210(DN)) blocking surface expression of SP-R210. Accordingly, WT mice cleared infection with Eap+ but succumbed to sublethal infection with Eap- S. aureus. However, SP-R210(DN) cells compensated by increasing non-opsonic phagocytosis of Eap+ S. aureus via the scavenger receptor scavenger receptor class A (SR-A), while non-opsonic uptake of Eap− S. aureus was impaired. Macrophages express two isoforms: SP-R210L and SP-R210S. The results show that WT alveolar macrophages are distinguished by expression of SP-R210L, whereas SR-A−/− alveolar macrophages are deficient in SP-R210L expressing only SP-R210S. Accordingly, SR-A−/− mice were highly susceptible to both Eap+ and Eap− S. aureus. The lungs of susceptible mice generated abnormal inflammatory responses that were associated with impaired killing and persistence of S. aureus infection in the lung.

IntroductionIn the steady state (when oxygen levels within a cell exceed bioenergetic requirements), activity of the glycolytic pathway, the TCA (tricarboxyic acid) cycle and electron transport chain combine to generate ∼38 molecules of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) per molecule of glucose metabolized. Glycolysis and the TCA cycle each generate 2 molecules of ATP with the remaining 34 molecules being produced during oxidative phosphorylation. This process provides the ATP necessary to maintain physiologic function. However, under conditions where oxygen demand exceeds supply (hypoxia), most cells retain the capacity to fundamentally shift metabolic strategy to a state where mitochondrial activity is decreased and glycolysis becomes the primary pathway for ATP generation (1Semenza G.L. Biochem. J. 2007; 405: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). Normally, this metabolic switch promotes cell survival during hypoxia and is thus adaptive in nature. In such cases, cells switch back to the predominantly oxidative metabolism when the oxygen balance is restored. This phenomenon is known as the Pasteur effect (3Seagroves T.N. Ryan H.E. Lu H. Wouters B.G. Knapp M. Thibault P. Laderoute K. Johnson R.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3436-3444Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). Alternatively, in the hypoxic compartment of a growing tumor, which has outgrown the local blood supply, the ability of cells to develop enhanced glycolytic metabolism confers a survival advantage for the tumor. Furthermore, some cancer cells develop the ability to maintain enhanced glycolysis even when sufficient oxygen supply returns, a phenomenon known as the Warburg effect (35Racker E. Am. Sci. 1972; 60: 56-63PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the ability of cells to increase the rate of glycolysis in response to hypoxia has important implications in both health and disease. The molecular mechanisms underlying these important switches in metabolic function are an area of intense investigation.One mechanism that underpins hypoxia-induced increase in flux through the glycolytic pathway involves transcriptional up-regulation of glycolytic enzymes by the hypoxia-inducible transcription factor, HIF (3Seagroves T.N.

In the current study, we provide data that, in addition to this transcriptional pathway, a non-transcriptional mechanism involving post-translational modification of key glycolytic enzymes facilitates the rapid increase in glycolysis that occurs during hypoxia.The small ubiquitin related modifier (SUMO) 2The abbreviations used are: SUMO, small ubiquitin-related modifier; MEF, mouse embryonic fibroblasts. protein family is a family of three small proteins of ∼17 kDa in mammals and one member in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which modify a wide range of target molecules (10Hay R.T.

Furthermore, a number of studies have demonstrated enhanced protein SUMO modification in hibernation and transient ischemic episodes, both of which involve significant decreases in tissue perfusion and oxygenation (22Lee Y.J.

Blood Flow Metab. 2007; 27: 950-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). However, to date, the physiological implications for SUMO modification in hypoxia have remained largely unknown.In the current study we found that even when gene transcription and translation were inhibited, hypoxia-induced flux through the glycolytic pathway, leading us to hypothesize a role for post-translational modifications in hypoxia-induced glycolysis. Because SUMO-1 modification has previously been shown to be increased in hypoxia in a range of models, we used a proteomic approach in S. cerevisiae to identify the proteins modified by Smt3 (the yeast homolog of mammalian SUMO) in hypoxia with an aim to identifying a possible general physiologic role for this modification. We found that a number of key metabolic enzymes were modified by Smt3 in hypoxic yeast. In mammalian cells, overexpression of SUMO-1 enhanced basal and hypoxia-induced glycolysis and glucose uptake. Conversely, overexpression of the SUMO isopeptidase SENP2 reversed hypoxia-induced glycolysis. We hypothesize that SUMO modification of metabolic enzymes is involved in the promotion of glycolysis in mammalian cells thus favoring a shift to glycolytic ATP generation. This compliments transcriptional up-regulation of glycolytic enzymes by HIF-dependent pathways and promotes metabolic adaptation to hypoxia, an event that may contribute to tumor cell survival.DISCUSSIONUnder steady state conditions, the primary method of ATP generation for most eukaryotic cells is aerobic respiration involving the combined activities of the glycolytic pathway, the TCA cycle, and the electron transport chain (1Semenza G.L. Biochem. J. 2007; 405: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar, 9Taylor C.T. Biochem. J. 2008; 409: 19-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Collectively, these processes allow the efficient generation of ∼38 molecules of ATP per molecule of glucose completely metabolized. When oxygen is limited, cells must change their metabolic strategy to sustain ATP generation. Because glycolysis alone generates a small net amount of ATP (2 molecules per molecule of glucose metabolized) without the requirement of oxygen, one metabolic option for cells is to enhance the rate of glycolysis such that this pathway becomes the primary source of cellular ATP generation, whereas actively decreasing oxidative phosphorylation. For this to occur, a significant elevation in the rate of glycolytic activity is required. One method by which this may be facilitated is through transcriptional up-regulation of glycolytic enzymes and glucose transporters, an event governed by the master regulator of hypoxia-dependent gene expression, HIF-1α (3Seagroves T.N. Ryan H.E. Lu H. Wouters B.G. Knapp M. Thibault P. Laderoute K. Johnson R.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3436-3444Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). Supporting this, HIF-1α-dependent alterations in critical regulators of mitochondrial respiration favor a decrease in activity of the TCA cycle and the mitochondrial electron transport chain, respectively, leading to decreased oxidative stress (4Kim J.W.

J. 2008; 409: 19-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that these transcriptional events are supported by posttranslational modification of metabolic enzymes that facilitate a rapid shift in the metabolic strategy of a cell when challenged with an acute hypoxic insult.Modification of proteins by the small ubiquitin-related modifier SUMO is critical in a range of cellular physiological processes. We and others have previously demonstrated that hypoxia alters the profile of SUMO-modified proteins (2Comerford K.M. Leonard M.O. Karhausen J. Carey R. Colgan S.P. Taylor C.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 986-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 14Nguyen H.V. Chen J.L. Zhong J. Kim K.J. Crandall E.D. Borok Z. Chen Y. Ann D.K. Am. J.

FEBS Lett. 2004; 569: 293-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 16Bae S.H. Jeong J.W. Park J.A. Kim S.H. Bae M.K. Choi S.J. Kim K.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 324: 394-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). In the current study, we have demonstrated that hypoxia increases SUMO-1 modification of metabolic enzymes, which is accompanied by enhancement of the glycolytic pathway leading us to the hypothesis that such a modification may positively regulate glycolysis and promote the generation of ATP in the absence of oxygen. Three key questions remain in the development of our understanding of the implications of this finding.First, what is the hypoxia-sensing mechanism underlying SUMO-1 modification of metabolic proteins? Although the functional importance of protein sumoylation has been described, the regulation of sumoylation is currently poorly understood. A recent publication has provided evidence for an inverse relationship between oxidative stress and activation of the cellular sumoylation machinery (17Bossis G. Melchior F. Mol. Cell. 2006; 21: 349-357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). In these studies, it is proposed that decreased oxidative stress is related to enhanced protein sumoylation. This effect is thought to be due to reactive oxygen species sensitivity of desumoylating enzymes. Because the production of reactive oxygen species is related to aerobic respiration in cells through the proton leak, it is possible that decreased reactive oxygen species production in hypoxia as a result of decreased activity of the electron transport chain leads to a subcellular microenvironment favorable to increased sumoylation of glycolytic enzymes.Second, a critical question relates to the source of SUMO-1 for protein modification in hypoxia. In the steady state, the majority of SUMO-1 is conjugated to proteins with little free SUMO-1 available (27Geiss-Friedlander R. Melchior F. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 8: 947-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (1333) Google Scholar). This leads to two possibilities: first, that de novo production of SUMO-1 in hypoxia provides the pool with which to modify the metabolic enzymes. We and others have previously demonstrated that hypoxia up-regulates expression of SUMO-1 mRNA and protein expression (2Comerford K.M. Leonard M.O. Karhausen J. Carey R. Colgan S.P. Taylor C.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 986-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 14Nguyen H.V. Chen J.L. Zhong J. Kim K.J. Crandall E.D. Borok Z. Chen Y. Ann D.K. Am. J. Pathol. 2006; 168: 1452-1463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 15Shao R. Zhang F.P. Tian F. Anders Friberg P. Wang X. Sjöland H. Billig H. FEBS Lett. 2004; 569: 293-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 16Bae S.H. Jeong J.W. Park J.A. Kim S.H. Bae M.K. Choi S.J. Kim K.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 324: 394-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). An alternative explanation for our observation of increased SUMO-1 modification in hypoxia may be a redistribution of SUMO-1 in hypoxia from substrates preferentially modified in normoxia to those preferentially modified in hypoxia. In support of this, several studies have recently reported changes in the pattern of SUMO modification in other cellular stresses including heat shock, electrophil and oxidative stress (17Bossis G. Melchior F. Mol. Cell. 2006; 21: 349-357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 30Golebiowski F. Matic I. Tatham M.H. Cole C. Yin Y. Nakamura A. Cox J. Barton G.J. Mann M. Hay R.T. Sci. Signal. 2009; 2: ra24Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar, 31Wuerzberger-Davis S.M. Nakamura Y. Seufzer B.J. Miyamoto S. Oncogene. 2007; 26: 641-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), consistent with the “preferential redistribution” hypothesis.A third key question relates to how SUMO-1 modification increases the overall cellular glycolytic activity. One possibility here is that SUMO modification of glycolytic enzymes as well as other metabolic proteins in hypoxia may directly increase enzyme activity. How SUMO-1 modification may function to increase enzyme activity remains unknown. One mechanism may be change in enzyme conformation as a result of the modification that may influence its activity as in the case with ubiquitination of the deiodinase enzyme where its modification by ubiquitin results in reversible deactivation of the enzyme (29Sagar G.D. Gereben B. Callebaut I. Mornon J.P. Zeöld A. da Silva W.S. Luongo C. Dentice M. Tente S.M. Freitas B.C. Harney J.W. Zavacki A.M. Bianco A.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 4774-4783Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Whether this is the case with GAPDH or other glycolytic enzymes remains unknown.Alternatively spatial rearrangement of SUMO-1-modified glycolytic enzymes in the cytoplasm into discreet complexes with other glycolytic enzymes may allow the generation of complexes that favor substrate channeling in the glycolytic pathway thus enhancing overall efficiency of this pathway. The relative importance of these processes remains to be determined but has been shown to be essential in the glycolytic pathways of some human protozoan parasites, trypanosomes (34Michels P.A. Bringaud F. Herman M. Hannaert V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1763: 1463-1477Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a recent study demonstrated the interaction of SUMO-1, the SUMO E3 ligase PIAS3, and the rate-limiting glycolytic enzyme, pyruvate kinase (36Spoden G.A. Morandell D. Ehehalt D. Fiedler M. Jansen-Dürr P. Hermann M. Zwerschke W. J. Cell. Biochem. 2009; 107: 293-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Whether this interaction of pyruvate kinase with SUMO has any effects on its enzyme activity or its interaction with other glycolytic enzymes is yet to be investigated.Finally, the physiological significance of this response remains to be clearly elucidated. We propose that this mechanism may have significance in the rapid adaptation to hypoxic/ischemic stress during which cells must switch to a state of enhanced flux through the glycolytic pathway for their survival as occurs during physiological processes such as hibernation and ischemia. Tumor cells on the other hand may exploit the same strategy to survive as a maladaptive mechanism. The SUMO conjugation pathway has recently been implicated in cancer development and metastasis (28Kim K.I. Baek S.H. Int. Rev. Cell Mol. Biol. 2009; 273: 265-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Several reports of functional alterations and changes in expression pattern of components of the SUMO conjugation machinery in different cancers including prostate cancers and thyroid adenomas exist (32Jacques C. Baris O. Prunier-Mirebeau D. Savagner F. Rodien P. Rohmer V. Franc B. Guyetant S. Malthiery Y. Reynier P. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2005; 90: 2314-2320Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 33Cheng J. Bawa T. Lee P. Gong L. Yeh E.T. Neoplasia. 2006; 8: 667-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). A recent study demonstrated a significant increase in protein sumoylation in two leukemic cell lines (HL60 and HL60RV) but more abundant in the vincristine-resistant HL60RV cancer cell line (39Vigodner M. Weisburg J.H. Shrivastava V. Marmor R.A. Fathy J. Skop N. Cell. Tissue Res. 2009; 336: 277-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Taken together such tumors may exploit the SUMO pathway as a metabolic advantage for their development and survival. In summary, we have demonstrated that SUMO-1 modification is associated with enhanced glycolysis indicating a possible role for this modification in mediating the fundamental shift in metabolic strategy observed when a eukaryotic cell encounters a hypoxic microenvironment. IntroductionIn the steady state (when oxygen levels within a cell exceed bioenergetic requirements), activity of the glycolytic pathway, the TCA (tricarboxyic acid) cycle and electron transport chain combine to generate ∼38 molecules of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) per molecule of glucose metabolized. Glycolysis and the TCA cycle each generate 2 molecules of ATP with the remaining 34 molecules being produced during oxidative phosphorylation. This process provides the ATP necessary to maintain physiologic function. However, under conditions where oxygen demand exceeds supply (hypoxia), most cells retain the capacity to fundamentally shift metabolic strategy to a state where mitochondrial activity is decreased and glycolysis becomes the primary pathway for ATP generation (1Semenza G.L. Biochem. J. 2007; 405: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). Normally, this metabolic switch promotes cell survival during hypoxia and is thus adaptive in nature. In such cases, cells switch back to the predominantly oxidative metabolism when the oxygen balance is restored. This phenomenon is known as the Pasteur effect (3Seagroves T.N. Ryan H.E. Lu H. Wouters B.G. Knapp M. Thibault P. Laderoute K. Johnson R.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3436-3444Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). Alternatively, in the hypoxic compartment of a growing tumor, which has outgrown the local blood supply, the ability of cells to develop enhanced glycolytic metabolism confers a survival advantage for the tumor. Furthermore, some cancer cells develop the ability to maintain enhanced glycolysis even when sufficient oxygen supply returns, a phenomenon known as the Warburg effect (35Racker E. Am. Sci. 1972; 60: 56-63PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the ability of cells to increase the rate of glycolysis in response to hypoxia has important implications in both health and disease. The molecular mechanisms underlying these important switches in metabolic function are an area of intense investigation.One mechanism that underpins hypoxia-induced increase in flux through the glycolytic pathway involves transcriptional up-regulation of glycolytic enzymes by the hypoxia-inducible transcription factor, HIF (3Seagroves T.N. Ryan H.E. Lu H. Wouters B.G. Knapp M. Thibault P. Laderoute K. Johnson R.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3436-3444Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). In the current study, we provide data that, in addition to this transcriptional pathway, a non-transcriptional mechanism involving post-translational modification of key glycolytic enzymes facilitates the rapid increase in glycolysis that occurs during hypoxia.The small ubiquitin related modifier (SUMO) 2The abbreviations used are: SUMO, small ubiquitin-related modifier; MEF, mouse embryonic fibroblasts. protein family is a family of three small proteins of ∼17 kDa in mammals and one member in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which modify a wide range of target molecules (10Hay R.T.

However, the molecular mechanisms controlling Wnt diffusion are not fully elucidated. The specific chondroitin sulfate (CS) structure synthesized by chondroitin-4-O-sulfotransferase-1 (C4ST-1) binds to Wnt-3a with high affinity (Nadanaka, S., Ishida, M., Ikegami, M., and Kitagawa, H.

In this study we tested whether Wnt signaling regulates sulfation patterns of cell-associated CS chains by suppressing expression of C4ST-1 to trigger release of Wnt molecules from Wnt-producing cells. C4ST-1 expression was dramatically reduced in L cells that stably expressed Wnt-3a (L-Wnt-3a cells) and had CS with low affinity for Wnt-3a. Forced expression of C4ST-1 in L-Wnt-3a cells inhibited diffusion of Wnt-3a due to structural alterations in CS chains mediated by C4ST-1. Furthermore, sustained Wnt signaling negatively regulated C4ST-1 expression in a cell-autonomous and non-cell autonomous fashion.

Cell. 1993; 4: 1267-1275Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 4Reichsman F. Smith L. Cumberledge S. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 819-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Thus, Wnt proteins are tightly associated with the surface of cells and the extracellular matrix and are unlikely to diffuse freely through the aqueous extracellular environment. Previous studies showed that secreted wingless (Wg), 2The abbreviations used are: Wg, wingless; BMP, bone morphogenetic protein; rWnt-3a, recombinant Wnt-3a; C4ST-1, chondroitin 4-O-sulfotransferase-1; CS, chondroitin sulfate; E disaccharide unit, GlcUA-GalNAc(4-O-sulfate,6-O-sulfate); GAG, glycosaminoglycan; GalNAc4S-6ST, N-acetylgalactosamine 4-sulfate 6-O-sulfotransferase; GlcUA, glucuronic acid; ΔHexUA, unsaturated hexuronic acid; HS, heparan sulfate; PG, proteoglycan. the Drosophila homologue of mammalian Wnt-1, could bind to glycosaminoglycan (GAG) moieties of proteoglycans (PGs) with high affinity and that the extracellular diffusion of Wg molecules was restricted by binding to the surface of cells and to extracellular matrix PGs (4Reichsman F. Smith L. Cumberledge S. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 819-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Therefore, we hypothesized that binding of Wnt to GAG chains might control Wnt release from Wnt-producing cells. GAG is attached as a side chain to PGs found on the cell surface and in the extracellular matrix, and it modulates signals that initiate differentiation during development and those that maintain homeostasis in adults. Previous studies indicate that PGs are critical modulators of wingless, hedgehog, and decapentaplegic morphogenic gradients and FGF signaling (5Bernfield M. Götte M. Park P.W. Reizes O. Fitzgerald M.L. Lincecum J. Zako M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 729-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (2332) Google Scholar, 6Haltiwanger R.S. Lowe J.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 491-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar). GAGs bind to a large variety of proteins on the cell surface and in the extracellular matrix, and the interactions between various signaling molecules and GAG moieties of PGs are one molecular basis for the function of PGs as signaling modulators. In addition, it is thought that the interactions between proteins and GAG chains are regulated by the fine structures of GAGs. Linear sulfated GAGs are classified based on structural units chondroitin sulfate (CS) and heparan sulfate (HS), which are composed of disaccharide units [-GlcUA-GalNAc-]n and [-GlcUA-GlcNAc-]n, respectively. During synthesis of the GAG backbone, sulfotransferases catalyzed various modifications such as sulfation. “Sugar codes” specified by specific sulfation patterns are thought to define specificity and affinity of protein-sugar interactions. Thus, we have been studying a sugar code to understand an intrinsic role for sugar in cell function. Our previous study showed that Wnt-3a binds to a specific structure containing E-disaccharide units (GlcUA-GalNAc(4-O-sulfate,6-O-sulfate)) with high affinity (7Nadanaka S. Ishida M. Ikegami M. Kitagawa H. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 27333-27343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In addition, CS chains containing E-disaccharide units concentrate Wnt-3a molecules on the surface of Wnt-producing cells and enhance Wnt-3a signaling (7Nadanaka S. Ishida M. Ikegami M. Kitagawa H. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 27333-27343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we demonstrated that chondroitin-4-O-sulfotransferase (C4ST-1) is involved in the biosynthesis of E-disaccharide units (8Uyama T. Ishida M. Izumikawa T. Trybala E. Tufaro F. Bergström T. Sugahara K. Kitagawa H. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 38668-38674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Based on these observations, we hypothesized that the level of C4ST-1 controls the E-disaccharide units on the cell surface and, therefore, modulates the association and dissociation of Wnt-3a and the cell surface. In this study, we found that C4ST-1 gene expression is negatively regulated by Wnt signaling. Therefore, we hypothesize that Wnt molecules secreted from the Wnt-producing cells down-regulate C4ST-1 gene expression in an autocrine manner, leading to structural changes in CS chains on the surface of the Wnt-producing cells and trigger the release of Wnt molecules from these cells. Here, we propose a model detailing how Wnt molecules diffuse from Wnt-producing cells. Purified recombinant mouse Wnt-3a (carrier-free) was obtained from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Anti-Wnt-3a antibody (#2391), the anti-β-catenin antibody (#610154), and the monoclonal anti-actin antibody (clone AC-40) (#A3853) were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Boston, MA), BD Transduction Laboratories, and Sigma, respectively.

HCT-8 (HRT-18) (catalogue no. 86040306) was obtained from the European Collection of Cell Cultures (Salisbury, England). The inhibitor of glycogen synthase kinase-3β, SB216763 (3-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-4-(1-methyl-1H-indol-3-yl)-1H-pyrrole-2,5-dione), and the inhibitor of Wnt signaling, XAV939 (3,5,7,8-tetrahydro-2-[4-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]-4H-thiopyrano[4,3-d]pyrimidin-4-one), were purchased from TOCRIS (Ellisville, MO) and Cayman (Ann Arbor, MI), respectively. Mouse Wnt-3a cDNA was obtained by reverse transcription-coupled polymerase chain reaction using total RNA isolated from L cells and the primers 5′-CCCAAGCTTGCGATGGCTCCTCTCGGATA-3′ and 5′-GGAATTCTTGCAGGTGTGCACGTCATAGACACG-3′. The resultant fragments were inserted into the HindIII and EcoRI sites of p3xFLAG CMV14 (Sigma) to express Wnt-3a protein tagged with the FLAG epitope at the C terminus. pIRESneo3-mWnt-3a-3xFLAG was constructed by inserting the NheI-NotI fragment of a PCR product amplified using p3xFLAG CMV14-mWnt-3a as a template with primers 5′-GCTAGCATGGCTCCTCTCGGATACCT-3′ and 5′-GCGGCCGCCTTGTCATCGTCATCCTTGTA-3′ into the NheI and NotI sites of pIRESneo3 (Clontech). L-Wnt-3a cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate, and 400 μg/ml G418, and maintained in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C. L, C2C12, human embryonic fibroblasts, LoVo, and HepG2 cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate, and RCM-1 and HCT-8 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate. All cells were maintained in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C. The expression plasmid (pcDNA3.1/zeo(−)-mC4ST-1) was transfected into L-Wnt-3a cells using FuGENETM 6 transfection reagent (Roche Diagnostics) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Transfectants were cultured in the presence of 400 μg/ml G418 and 400 μg/ml zeocin (Invitrogen). Zeocin-resistant clones were then picked up and propagated for experiments. C2C12 cells were transfected with pIRESneo3-mWnt-3a-3xFLAG. After selection with 700 μg/ml (clone 1) or 800 μg/ml (clone 2) G418 (Invitrogen), surviving colonies were used for experiments. On day 0, L or L-Wnt-3a cells (2.6 × 104 cells) were inoculated with HeLa cells (2.6 × 104 cells) in a 6-cm dish. On day 5, cells were passaged at a ratio of 1:20. On day 10, total RNA was isolated from the co-cultured cells after cells were washed with PBS. Human embryonic fibroblasts (passage 27) (1 × 104 cells) were inoculated with L or L-Wnt-3a cells (1.0 × 104 cells) in a 3.5-cm dish and cultured for the indicated times without passage. To evaluate the expression level of hC4ST-1 in HeLa cells and human embryonic fibroblasts, real-time PCR was carried out using primer pairs specific for the human C4ST-1 and the human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) genes (see supplemental Fig. S1A); human C4ST-1 forward primer (5′-GTGGGGAGAGGGAGAGAATCATG-3′) and reverse primer (3′-CAAGAACGACCCATCCTATTTCC-3′) and human GAPDH forward primer (5′-TGCTGGGGAGTCCCTGCCACA-3′) and (reverse primer 5′-GGTACATGACAAGGTGCGGCTC-3′). The conditioned media recovered from confluent cultures of L-Wnt-3a cells were centrifuged, sterilized by filtration through 0.2-μm filters, and mixed at 1:2 ratio with normal growth medium before addition to cells. On day 0, mouse L-Wnt-3a cells and L-Wnt-3a-C4ST-1 transfectants were seeded at a density of 0.5 × 106 cells per 3.5-cm dish and cultured in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 400 μg/ml G418, and 400 μg/ml zeocin. On day 1, the growth medium in the cultures was replaced with 1 ml of fresh growth medium without G418 and zeocin. On day 3, conditioned medium was recovered from confluent cultures, centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 5 min and sterilized by filtration through 0.2-μm filters. The conditioned medium corresponding to 250 μg of cellular proteins was used in the luciferase reporter assay using C2C12 cells. One day before transfection, C2C12 cells were seeded on a 24-well culture plate. The reporter plasmid, pTCF7wt-luc (1 μg) (9Ueda Y. Hijikata M. Takagi S. Takada R. Takada S. Chiba T. Shimotohno K. Int. J. Cancer. 2002; 99: 681-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), and the reference plasmid, pRL-TK (harboring thymidine kinase promoter just upstream of Renilla luciferase; Promega) (0.1 μg), were transfected into C2C12 cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). After 12 h, cells were treated with conditioned medium prepared from L-Wnt-3a cells for activation of Wnt signal pathway and cultured for an additional 12 h. Cells were washed with PBS and lysed in 100 μl of passive lysis buffer (Promega). Firefly luciferase and Renilla luciferase activities were measured with 5 μl of cell lysate using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega). A Lumat LB9507 (EG&G Beltold) was used in the linear range. “Relative activity” was defined as the ratio of firefly luciferase activity to Renilla luciferase activity. On day 0, L or L-Wnt-3a cells (1 × 103 cells) were seeded on a 6-cm dish and treated with 5 μm XAV939 or DMSO as a vehicle. The incubation medium was replaced with fresh growth medium containing XAV939 or DMSO at 12-h intervals for 7 days. Total RNA was extracted from cells by the guanidine phenol method using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocols. Aliquots of 1 μg of total RNA were digested with 2 IU of RQ1 RNase-free DNase (Promega) for 30 min at 37 °C and then incubated for 10 min at 65 °C with stop solution (Promega). For reverse transcription, 0.75 μg of total RNA were treated with Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) using random primers (nonadeoxyribonucleotide mixture; pd (N)9) (Takara bio Inc., Shiga, Japan). Quantitative real-time PCR was conducted using a FastStart DNA Master plus SYBR Green I in a LightCycler 1.5 (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's protocols. The housekeeping genes (GAPDH and β-actin) were used as internal controls for quantification. The expression level of C4ST-1 mRNA was normalized to that of the GAPDH or β-actin transcripts; mouse C4ST-1 forward primer (5′-ACCTCGTGGGCAAGTATGAG-3′) and reverse primer (5′-TCTGGAAGAACTCCGTGGTC-3′); mouse GAPDH forward primer (5′-CATCTGAGGGCCCACTG-3′) and reverse primer (5′-GAGGCCATGTAGGCCATGA-3′); mouse β-actin forward primer (5′-AGAGGGAAATCGTGCGTGAC-3′) and reverse primer 5′-CAATAGTGATGACCTGGCCGT-3′). Poly(A)+ RNA was purified from L and L-Wnt-3a cells using the Quick Prep Micro mRNA purification kit (GE Healthcare). Aliquots of 1 μg of poly(A)+ RNA were subjected to 1.2% agarose gel electrophoresis containing 2.2 m formaldehyde, transferred to a Hybond N+ membrane (GE Healthcare), and hybridized with radiolabeled cDNA probe specific to either mC4ST-1 or mGAPDH. A specific cDNA probe to C4ST-1 was prepared from pCMV-mC4ST-1 (8Uyama T. Ishida M. Izumikawa T. Trybala E. Tufaro F. Bergström T. Sugahara K. Kitagawa H. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 38668-38674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) by double-digestion with SacII and SalI. cDNA probes (25 ng) were labeled with Redivue [α-32P]CTP (6000 Ci/mmol) (GE Healthcare) using the RediprimeTMII Random Prime Labeling System (GE Healthcare), and poly(A)+ RNA that had been transferred to membranes were hybridized with radiolabeled cDNA probe in ULTRAhyb solution (Ambion) overnight at 42 °C according to the manufacturer's protocols. Cells grown in 60-mm dishes were treated with 2 ml of conditioned media for the indicated periods. When cells were treated with recombinant mouse Wnt-3a, cells grown in 35-mm dishes were washed twice with serum-free DMEM and incubated in 1 ml of serum-free DMEM containing recombinant mouse Wnt-3a. To measure β-catenin accumulation in the cytosol, cells were treated with Wnt-3a, washed with PBS, harvested, lysed in 200 μl of PBS containing 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 10 μm Z-Leu-Leu-Leu-H (Peptide Institute, Inc., Osaka, Japan), and protease inhibitor mixture (Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan) and incubated at 4 °C for 5 min. The lysates were centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 5 min, and the resulting supernatants were removed from the pellets and further centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 min. The supernatants resulting from the second centrifugation were mixed with 100 μl of 3× SDS loading buffer (187.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, containing 6% (w/v) SDS, 30% glycerol, and 0.03% (w/v) phenol red) and boiled for 5 min. Alternatively, cells were solubilized in 0.1% saponin lysis buffer (25 mm Hepes containing 75 mm potassium acetate) for 30 min at 4 °C (10Soriano S. Kang D.E. Fu M. Pestell R. Chevallier N. Zheng H. Koo E.H. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 785-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) and centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 5 min. To detect cellular Wnt-3a, cells were lysed in 1% Triton X-100 lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 1 mm EDTA, 0.15 m NaCl, 10% glycerol, 10 μm Z-Leu-Leu-Leu-H, and protease inhibitor mixture) for 30 min on ice and centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 5 min. The protein concentration of each sample was determined using a BCA protein assay kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc., Waltham, MA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Each sample was subjected to SDS-PAGE (7.5% gel), transferred to Hybond-ECL nitrocellulose filters (GE Healthcare), and analyzed using the procedure as described in Yoshida et al. (11Yoshida H. Matsui T. Yamamoto A. Okada T. Mori K. Cell. 2001; 107: 881-891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3014) Google Scholar) with an ECL AdvanceTM Western blotting detection kit (GE Healthcare) according to the manufacturer's protocol. To detect secreted Wnt-3a proteins, conditioned medium obtained from L-Wnt-3a cells and L-Wnt-3a-C4ST-1 transfectants was centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 5 min, and supernatants were analyzed by SDS-PAGE under non-reducing conditions. Cell lysates (8 μg of proteins) prepared using 0.1% saponin lysis buffer were digested with 1 IU of N-glycosidase F (Roche Diagnostics) at 37 °C overnight. After C2C12 cells overexpressing FLAG-tagged Wnt-3a proteins were cultured for 3 days, the conditioned medium was collected and centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 5 min. Cells were lysed in 1% Triton X-100 lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 1 mm EDTA, 0.15 m NaCl, 10% glycerol, 10 μm Z-Leu-Leu-Leu-H, and a protease inhibitor mixture) for 30 min on ice and then clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 5 min. Anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel (Sigma) was added to the medium and cell lysate and incubated overnight at 4 °C with rotating. The beads were collected by brief centrifugation and washed with the lysis buffer three times. Immunoprecipitated materials were eluted by boiling for 5 min in 1× Laemmli sample buffer in the absence of dithiothreitol and then subjected to immunoblotting using anti-FLAG rabbit polyclonal antibody (Sigma). Recombinant Wnt-3a (5 ng (0.125 pmol)) was preincubated with CS chains (50 ng as GlcUA) prepared from each cell line in 1 ml of serum-free DMEM for 30 min at room temperature and then added to L cells cultured in 6-cm dishes. L cells were washed with serum-free DMEM before adding recombinant Wnt-3a (rWnt-3a)-CS complexes. After 2 h, accumulation of β-catenin in the cytosol was quantified using immunoblotting. Similar competition assays using CS-derived tetrasaccharides with various sulfation patterns as the inhibitor were carried out. GalNAc(4-O-sulfate,6-O-sulfate)-GlcUA-GalNAc(4-O-sulfate,6-O-sulfate)-GlcUA-O-p-methoxyphenyl (E-E sequence) was chemically synthesized (12Tamura J. Neumann K.W. Kurono S. Ogawa T. Carbohydr. Res. 1997; 305: 43-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). GalNAc(4-O-sulfate)-GlcUA-GalNAc(4-O-sulfate,6-O-sulfate)-GlcUA-O-p-methoxyphenyl (A-E sequence) and GalNAc(6-O-sulfate)-GlcUA-GalNAc(6-O-sulfate)-GlcUA-O-p-methoxyphenyl (C-C sequence) were obtained by the complete digestion of E-E sequence using chondro-6-sulfatase (50 mIU) and chondro-4-sulfatase (50 mIU), respectively. Each tetrasaccharide (125 pmol) was preincubated with rWnt-3a (0.125 pmol) for 30 min at room temperature and then added to L cells. After 2 h, cytosolic β-catenin was quantified using immunoblotting. Human embryonic fibroblasts treated with or without recombinant Wnt-3a or SB216763 were homogenized by passing through a 23-gauge needle in PBS containing protease inhibitor mixture and centrifuging at 9000 rpm for 10 min. The resultant supernatants were analyzed by immunoblotting. Cells were homogenized in acetone, extracted with acetone three times, and air-dried thoroughly. The dried materials were digested with heat-activated actinase E (10% by weight of dried materials) in 0.1 m borate-sodium, pH 8.0, containing 10 mm CaCl2 at 55 °C for 48 h. The samples were adjusted to 5% v/v in trichloroacetic acid and centrifuged. The resulting supernatants were extracted with diethyl ether three times to remove the trichloroacetic acid. The aqueous phase was evaporated to dryness, dissolved in 50 mm pyridine acetate, pH 5.0, and subjected to gel filtration on a PD-10 column (GE Healthcare) using 50 mm pyridine acetate, pH 5.0, as an eluent. The flow-through fractions were collected and evaporated to dryness. The dried materials were dissolved in 300 mm phosphate buffer containing 150 mm NaCl and applied to an anion-exchange Micro SpinColumnTM (Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA). After washing with 300 mm phosphate buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, the bound GAGs were eluted by 300 mm phosphate buffer containing 1.5 m NaCl and then desalted using a PD-10 column as described above. Purified GAGs were digested with 5 mIU of chondroitinase ABC or a mixture of 0.5 mIU of heparinase and 0.5 mIU of heparitinase at 37 °C for 2 h. Reactions were terminated by boiling for 1 min. The digests were derivatized with a fluorophore 2-aminobenzamide and then analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) as reported previously (13Kitagawa H. Kinoshita A. Sugahara K. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 232: 114-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). We found that ∼80% of the Wnt-3a protein from mouse L cells expressing high amounts of Wnt-3a protein (L-Wnt-3a cells) was secreted into the culture medium, contrary to previous findings in which secreted Wnt-3a molecules tightly associated with the cell surface and extracellular matrix. Based on this observation and our previous finding that Wnt-3a could bind to GAG chains with high affinity depending on the specific sulfation patterns of the GAGs (7Nadanaka S. Ishida M. Ikegami M. Kitagawa H. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 27333-27343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that structural alterations of cellular GAG chains might occur in L-Wnt-3a cells. Thus, we analyzed the structures of GAG chains associated with L cells and L-Wnt-3a cells. As shown in Fig. 1A, disaccharide composition of HS in L-Wnt-3a cells was comparable with that of L cells. Consistent with this finding, the expression levels of the biosynthetic enzymes involved in the sulfation of HS were not significantly affected by Wnt-3a signaling (Fig. 1B). In contrast, the CS chains of L-Wnt-3a cells have less 4-O-sulfation than those of L cells (Fig. 1C and supplemental Table S1). In addition, the E-disaccharide unit (ΔDi-diSE), which may be involved in modulation of Wnt-3a signaling, was also reduced in L-Wnt-3a cells relative to L cells (Fig. 1C and supplemental Table S1). Therefore, we investigated the expression levels of sulfotransferases involved in the sulfation of CS chains. To date, three sulfotransferases, C4ST-1, C4ST-2, and D4ST, involved in the 4-O-sulfation of GalNAc residues in CS/dermatan sulfate have been reported (14Kusche-Gullberg M. Kjellén L. Curr. Opin Struct. Biol. 2003; 13: 605-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). In addition, GalNAc4S-6ST was implicated in the 6-O-sulfation of 4-O-sulfated GalNAc residues and production of E-disaccharide units (8Uyama T. Ishida M. Izumikawa T. Trybala E. Tufaro F.

Habuchi O. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1780: 687-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Therefore, we measured the expression levels of these genes using real-time PCR. There was a sharp decrease in the expression of C4ST-1 in L-Wnt-3a cells relative to the expression in L cells; in contrast, levels of D4ST-1 and GalNAc4S-6ST mRNA in L-Wnt-3a cells were indistinguishable from those in L cells (Fig. 1D). C4ST-2 mRNA was expressed at elevated levels in L-Wnt-3a cells compared with L cells (Fig. 1D). Northern blot analysis confirmed that C4ST-1 expression was depressed in L-Wnt3a cells (Fig. 1E). In addition, we established two C2C12 cell clones (clones 1 and 2) stably expressing Wnt-3a tagged with FLAG epitope to exclude the possibility that C4ST-1 expression was down-regulated in L-Wnt-3a cells due to clonal selection of cell lines. As shown in Fig. 2A, C4ST-1 expression levels were also suppressed in the two C2C12 cell clones expressing Wnt-3a, corresponding to the expression levels of Wnt-3a. Moreover, secretion of Wnt-3a molecules into the culture medium appeared to be negatively correlated with C4ST-1 expression (Fig. 2, A and B).FIGURE 2The expression of C4ST-1 gene was suppressed in C2C12 cells expressing Wnt-3a. A, two cell lines of C2C12 cells expressing FLAG-tagged Wnt-3a proteins were established and named clone 1 (panels a and b) and clone 2 (panels c and d). C4ST-1 mRNA expression levels in these clones were examined by real-time PCR as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Panels a and c and panels b and d indicate the expression levels of Wnt-3a and C4ST-1, respectively. B, cellular and secreted FLAG-tagged Wnt-3a proteins of C2C12 cells expressing FLAG-tagged Wnt-3a, clones 1 and 2, were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel and then analyzed by immunoblotting using anti-FLAG antibody. Empty indicates C2C12 cells carrying a pIRES-neo3 empty vector. The total amount of Wnt-3a protein in clone 2 was expressed relative to that in clone 1 (right panel).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We next established L-Wnt-3a cell clones stably transfected with C4ST-1 cDNA to examine whether down-regulation of C4ST-1 enhanced the release of Wnt-3a into the culture medium. Eight stably transfected clones were obtained, and the expression levels of C4ST-1, GalNAc4S-6ST, and Wnt-3a were examined by real-time PCR. C4ST-1 expression had little effect on the level of GalNAc4S-6ST or Wnt-3a expression (Fig. 3A). In addition, because Komekado et al. (16Komekado H. Yamamoto H. Chiba T. Kikuchi A. Genes Cells. 2007; 12: 521-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) reported that N-glycosylation of Wnt-3a is needed for secretion of an active Wnt-3a, we confirmed that overexpression of C4ST-1 had no effect on the N-glycosylation of Wnt-3a using two independently transfected clones, 3 and 11 (Fig. 3B). We then assayed the amount of Wnt-3a in the medium of each transfectant clone using C2C12 cells transiently transfected with pTCF7wt-luc reporter vector carrying seven repeats of the TCF binding consensus sequence (9Ueda Y. Hijikata M. Takagi S. Takada R. Takada S. Chiba T. Shimotohno K. Int. J. Cancer. 2002; 99: 681-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) (supplemental Fig. S2). Conditioned medium prepared from each transfectant clone was used to stimulate C2C12 cells carrying the reporter vector for Wnt signals. A decline in the amount of Wnt-3a secreted into the medium, as determined by stimulation of C2C12 cells, was accompanied by an increase in C4ST-1 expression levels in Wnt-3a-producing L cells (Fig. 4A and supplemental Fig. S3), whereas the amount of Wnt-3a protein bound to the Wnt-3a-producing L cells increased (Fig. 4B). As shown in Fig. 3, we confirmed that a decrease in secreted Wnt-3a protein was not caused by reduction in the expression level of the Wnt-3a gene or defects in glycosylation of Wnt-3a. In addition, the amount of E-disaccharide units increased approximately linearly with the expression level of C4ST-1 (correlation coefficient: 0.75) (Fig. 4A and supplemental Fig. S3 and Table S1).

https://openalex.org/W1998513750,"Inappropriate activation of the NOTCH signaling pathway, for example, by activating mutations, contributes to the pathogenesis of various human malignancies. Here, we demonstrate that aberrant expression of an essential NOTCH coactivator of the Mastermind-like (MAML) family provides an alternative mechanism to activate NOTCH signaling in human lymphoma cells. We detected high-level MAML2 expression in several B cell-derived lymphoma types, including classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) cells, relative to normal B cells. Inhibition of MAML-protein activity by a dominant negative form of MAML or by small hairpin RNAs targeting MAML2 in cHL cells resulted in downregulation of the NOTCH target genes HES7 and HEY1, which we identified as overexpressed in cHL cells, and in reduced proliferation. Furthermore, a NOTCH gene-expression signature in cHL cells confirmed their cell-autonomous NOTCH activity. Finally, in line with the essential role of MAML proteins for assembly and activity of the NOTCH transcriptional complex (NTC), we show that MAML-derived small-peptide constructs block NOTCH activity and disrupt NTC formation in vitro. These data strongly suggest direct targeting of the NTC as treatment strategy for NOTCH-dependent malignancies."

Ultimately a variety of in vitro and in vivo approaches were used to verify the prediction that the tyrosine phosphorylation levels of five high-ranking substrates, PLC-γ1, Gab1, SHP2, EGFR, and SHP1, are indeed specifically modulated by PTP1B. In addition, we demonstrate that the PTP1B-mediated dephosphorylation of Gab1 negatively affects its EGF-induced association with the phosphatase SHP2.

https://openalex.org/W2077906921,"The DExH protein RNA helicase A (RHA) plays numerous roles in cell physiology, and post-transcriptional activation of gene expression is a major role among them. RHA selectively activates translation of complex cellular and retroviral mRNAs. Although RHA requires interaction with structural features of the 5'-UTR of these target mRNAs, the molecular basis of their translation activation by RHA is poorly understood. RHA contains a conserved ATPase-dependent helicase core that is flanked by two α-β-β-β-α double-stranded RNA-binding domains at the N terminus and repeated arginine-glycine residues at the C terminus. The individual recombinant N-terminal, central helicase, and C-terminal domains were evaluated for their ability to specifically interact with cognate RNAs by in vitro biochemical measurements and mRNA translation assays in cells. The results demonstrate that N-terminal residues confer selective interaction with retroviral and junD target RNAs. Conserved lysine residues in the distal α-helix of the double-stranded RNA-binding domains are necessary to engage structural features of retroviral and junD 5'-UTRs. Exogenous expression of the N terminus coprecipitates junD mRNA and inhibits the translation activity of endogenous RHA. The results indicate that the molecular basis for the activation of translation by RHA is recognition of target mRNA by the N-terminal domain that tethers the ATP-dependent helicase for rearrangement of the complex 5'-UTR."

Telomere elongation by human telomerase is inhibited in cis by the telomeric protein TRF1 and its associated proteins. However, the link between TRF1 and inhibition of telomerase elongation of telomeres remains elusive because TRF1 has no direct effect on telomerase activity. We have previously identified one Pin2/TRF1-interacting protein, PinX1, that has the unique property of directly binding and inhibiting telomerase catalytic activity (Zhou, X. Z., and Lu, K. P.

By identifying functional domains and key amino acid residues in PinX1 and TRF1 responsible for the PinX1-TRF1 interaction, we show that the TRF homology domain of TRF1 interacts with a minimal 20-amino acid sequence of PinX1 via hydrophilic and hydrophobic interactions. Significantly, either disrupting this interaction by mutating the critical Leu-291 residue in PinX1 or knocking down endogenous TRF1 by RNAi abolishes the ability of PinX1 to localize to telomeres and to inhibit telomere elongation in cells even though neither has any effect on telomerase activity per se.

Recently, mutations have been identified in both miRNAs and target genes that disrupt regulatory relationships, contribute to oncogenesis and serve as biomarkers for cancer risk. KIT, an established oncogene with a multifaceted role in melanogenesis and melanoma pathogenesis, has recently been shown to be upregulated in some melanomas, and is also a target of the miRNA miR-221. Here, we describe a genetic variant in the 3′ UTR of the KIT oncogene that correlates with a greater than fourfold increased risk of acral melanoma. This KIT variant results in a mismatch in the seed region of a miR-221 complementary site and reporter data suggests that this mismatch can result in increased expression of the KIT oncogene. Consistent with the hypothesis that this is a functional variant, KIT mRNA and protein levels are both increased in the majority of samples harboring the KIT variant. This work identifies a novel genetic marker for increased heritable risk of melanoma."

Although PTKs have a well-established role in regulating breast cancer growth, contribution of PTPs remains mostly unknown. Here, we report that the tyrosine phosphatase PTPH1 stimulates breast cancer growth through regulating vitamin D receptor (VDR) expression. PTPH1 was shown to be overexpressed in 49% of primary breast cancer and levels of its protein expression positively correlate with the clinic metastasis, suggesting its oncogenic activity. Indeed, PTPH1 promotes breast cancer growth by a mechanism independent of its phosphatase activity, but dependent of its stimulatory effect on the nuclear receptor VDR protein expression and depletion of induced VDR abolishes the PTPH1 oncogenic activity. Additional analyses showed that PTPH1 binds VDR and increases its cytoplasmic accumulation, leading to their mutual stabilization and stable expression of a nuclear localization-deficient VDR abolishes the growth-inhibitory activity of the receptor independent of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3. These results reveal a new paradigm in which a PTP may stimulate breast cancer growth through increasing cytoplasmic translocation of a nuclear receptor, leading to their mutual stabilization."

Indeed, we show that wild-type mast cells are highly sensitive to apoptosis induced by granule permeabilization, whereas serglycin-deficient cells are largely resistant. The reduced sensitivity of serglycin−/− cells to apoptosis was accompanied by reduced granule damage, reduced release of proteases into the cytosol, and defective caspase-3 activation. Mechanistically, the apoptosis-promoting effect of serglycin involved serglycin-dependent proteases, as indicated by reduced sensitivity to apoptosis and reduced caspase-3 activation in cells lacking individual mast cell-specific proteases.

To examine the significance of the co-expression of FcγRIIa and FcγRIIIb on human neutrophils, we analyzed the neutrophil responses to stimuli that engage these FcγRs, namely the phagocytosis of human IgG-opsonized zymosan and the responses to heat-aggregated IgGs. Blocking antibodies to either FcγR significantly decreased the phagocytic index and the stimulated production of superoxide anions. Both receptors are required for optimal IgG-dependent responses by human neutrophils. On the other hand, only blocking antibodies to FcγRIIIb, but not to FcγRIIa, inhibited the mobilization of calcium in response to heat-aggregated IgGs. Furthermore, phagocytosis of IgG-opsonized zymosan by human neutrophils required an extracellular influx of calcium that was blocked only by antibodies against FcγRIIIb.

Here, we describe the role of LIMP-2, a lysosomal type III transmembrane glycoprotein and scavenger-like protein, in Listeria phagocytosis. LIMP-2-deficient mice display a macrophage-related defect in Listeria innate immunity. They produce less acute phase pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokines, MCP-1, TNF-α, and IL-6 but normal levels of IL-12, IL-10, and IFN-γ and a 25-fold increase in susceptibility to Listeria infection. This macrophage defect results in a low listericidal potential, poor response to TNF-α activation signals, impaired phago-lysosome transformation into antigen-processing compartments, and uncontrolled LM cytosolic growth that fails to induce normal levels of acute phase pro-inflammatory cytokines. LIMP-2 transfection of CHO cells confirmed that LIMP-2 participates in the degradation of Listeria within phagosomes, controls the late endosomal/lysosomal fusion machinery, and is linked to the activation of Rab5a. Therefore, the role of LIMP-2 appears to be connected to the TNF-α-dependent and early activation of Listeria macrophages through internal signals linking the regulation of late trafficking events with the onset of the innate Listeria immune response."

Upon an osmotic challenge, it is regulated by the immediate biochemical activation of preformed enzymes and by activation of gene expression. Whereas the transcriptional response has been investigated intensively, the mechanisms by which enzymes are activated in osmotic stress situations are still elusive. Here, we address this topic for the moderately halotolerant cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, which synthesizes glucosylglycerol as a compatible solute. The key enzyme of the glucosylglycerol pathway (GgpS) is inhibited by nucleic acids in a sequence- and length-independent manner. The protein binds DNA, RNA, and heparin via a salt-dependent electrostatic interaction with the negatively charged backbone of the polyanions. Mechanistically, DNA binding to the enzyme causes noncompetitive inhibition of GgpS activity. The interaction of the enzyme and nucleic acids under in vivo conditions is indicated by the co-purification of both after cross-linking in Synechocystis cells. We propose a novel mechanism of activity regulation by the nonspecific salt-dependent binding of an enzyme to nucleic acids."

In this study, the intrinsic RNase activity and the bacterial cell growth-arresting activity of HP0894 were established. The RNA-binding surface was identified at three residue clusters: (Lys(8) and Ser(9)), (Lys(50)-Lys(54) and Glu(58)), and (Arg(80) and His(84)-Phe(88)). In particular, the -UA- and -CA- sequences in RNA were preferentially cleaved by HP0894, and residues Lys(52), Trp(53), and Ser(85)-Lys(87) were observed to be the main contributors to sequence recognition. The action of HP0894 could be inhibited by the HP0895 protein, and the HP0894-HP0895 complex formed an oligomer with a binding stoichiometry of 1:1. The N and C termini of HP0894 constituted the binding sites to HP0895. In contrast, the unstructured C-terminal region of HP0895 was responsible for binding to HP0894 and underwent a conformational change in the process. Finally, DNA binding activity was observed for both HP0895 and the HP0894-0895 complex but not for HP0894 alone. Taken together, it is concluded that the HP0894-HP0895 protein couple is a TA system in H. pylori, where HP0894 is a toxin with an RNase function, whereas HP0895 is an antitoxin functioning by binding to both the toxin and DNA."

Our analyses suggest that Ser-707 is phosphorylated by c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK).

Two separate regions of WAVE2 are involved in WAVE2-PKA complex formation. This complex localizes to the leading edge of MDA-MB-231 cells. PKA activation results in enlargement of the membrane protrusion. WAVE2 depletion impairs PKA localization at membrane protrusions and the enlargement of membrane protrusion induced by PKA activation. Together, these results suggest that WAVE2 works as an A-kinase-anchoring protein that recruits PKA at membrane protrusions and plays a role in the enlargement of membrane protrusions induced by PKA activation."

Hence, we generated the Tolβ-NOD transgenic mice in which doxycycline-induc-ible luciferase gene is selectively expressed in β cells. A sharp reduction in bioluminescence emitted in vivo from β cells at the early stages, preceded by several weeks of a limited reduction in β-cell mass. Since this decline could be due to the ongoing inflammatory process occurring in vivo, we exposed control islets to inflammatory cytokines and observed a dramatic decrease in luciferase luminescence, which appears to be due in part to a decrease in protein levels and a drop in intracellular ATP levels.

Its role in other epithelial cancers has not been investigated, except for esophageal cancer, in which FGF8b overexpression was mainly found in tumor biopsies of male patients. These observations were consistent with previous findings in these cancer types that the male sex-hormone androgen is responsible for FGF8b expression. Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is a highly metastatic cancer of head and neck commonly found in Asia. It is etiologically associated with Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) infection, inflammatory tumor microenvironment and relatively higher male predominance. Here, we reported for the first time that FGF8b is overexpressed in this EBV-associated non-hormone-related cancer of the head and neck, NPC. More importantly, overexpression of FGF8b mRNA and protein was detected in a large majority of NPC tumors from both male and female genders, in addition to multiple NPC cell lines. We hypothesized that FGF8b overexpression may contribute to NPC tumorigenesis. Using EBV-associated NPC cell lines, we demonstrated that specific knockdown of FGF8b by small interfering RNA inhibited cell proliferation, migration and invasion, whereas exogenous FGF8b stimulated these multiple phenotypes. Further mechanistic investigation revealed that in addition to NF-κB signaling (a major inflammatory signaling pathway known to be activated in NPC), an important EBV oncoprotein, the latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1), was found to be a direct inducer of FGF8b overexpression in NPC cells, whereas androgen (testosterone) has minimal effect on FGF8b expression in EBV-associated NPC cells. In summary, our study has identified LMP1 as the first viral oncogene capable of directly inducing FGF8b (an important cellular oncogene) expression in human cancer cells. This novel mechanism of viral-mediated FGF8 upregulation may implicate a new role of oncoviruses in human carcinogenesis."

Importantly, skin papilloma development was delayed in FosAA, Fos362A and Rsk2-deficient mice, accelerated in FosDD mice and unaffected in Fos374A mutants. Furthermore, the related Fos protein and putative RSK2 target Fra1 failed to substitute for Fos in papilloma development. This indicates that phosphorylation of serines 362 and 374 exerts context-dependent roles in modulating Fos activity in vivo. Inhibition of Fos C-terminal phosphorylation on serine 362 by targeting RSK2 might be of therapeutic relevance for skin tumours."
