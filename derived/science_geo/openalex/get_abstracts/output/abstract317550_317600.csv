https://openalex.org/W2086710795,"An extensive plume of water enriched with helium-3 has been discovered in the deep Pacific Ocean at latitude 15 degrees S on the East Pacific Rise. In the core of the plume, at a depth of 2500 meters over the ridge crest, the helium-3/helium-4 ratio is 50 percent higher than the ratio in atmospheric helium, indicating a strong injection of mantle or primordial helium at the spreading center axis through local hydrothermal systems. The helium-3 plume is completely absent east of the rise, but it can be traced over 2000 kilometers to the west above a newly observed physical feature: a density discontinuity here caled the ""ridge-crest front."" The injected plume provides a unique deep-sea tracer with an asymmetric distribution which shows that the deep circulation across the rise is from east to west. The striking intensity and lateral extent of this helium-3 anomaly, compared to observations at known oceanic hydrohrmal sites, suggest that the largest hydrothermal fields in the ocean are yet to be discovered and that they will be found near 15 degrees S on the East Pacific Rise."

However, the significance of these discoveries rests entirely on the ability to determine whether these remains were modified by man. The results of experiments of elephant butchering, bone fracturing, and bone tool manufacturing support the hypothesis that these modified bones can be used to identify the presence of cultural activities."

This age correlates with the Tortonian marine stage of Europe and the Chasicoan Land Mammal Age of South America."

The photochemical aftereffects of the event have been simulated using a comprehensive model of atmospheric trace composition. Calculations indicate that up to 45 percent of the ozone in the Northern Hemisphere may have been depleted by Tunguska's nitric oxide cloud early in 1909 and large ozone reductions may have persisted until 1912. Measurements of atmospheric transparency by the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory for the years 1909 to 1911 show evidence of a steady ozone recovery from unusually low levels in early 1909, implying a total ozone deficit of 30 Â± 15 percent. The coincidence in time between the observed ozone recovery and the Tunguska meteor fall indicates that the event may provide a test of current ozone depletion theories."

https://openalex.org/W2074974730,"Critics of the idea that gas and oil price decontrol will increase conservation and renewable resource investments argue that Reagan's plans are not corroborated by any studies. The debate centers on different perceptions of the role of government and the marketplace. Conservationists feel that Reagan should have abolished all subsidies for conventional and nuclear energy as well as lifting price controls, but they also argue for government intervention. Studies by the Solar Energy Research Institute, the National Audubon Society, the Mellon Institute, the Edison Electric Institute, and others project a different future than the Administration, but conservationists hope to see money shifted from other areas of the budget, such as nuclear power, for their projects.

Experts in the petroleum industry differ in their estimates of petroleum reserves in the lower 48 states, but have greater agreement for other sites, especially Alaska. A description of how the USGS geologists make their estimates is included in this article. A history of the Permian Basin is given and a discussion of how estimates in this area were determined in 2 separate studies is presented. The differences between the geologic method and the finding-rate approach in estimating petroleum reserves are explained."
