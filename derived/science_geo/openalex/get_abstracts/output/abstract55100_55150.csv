https://openalex.org/W2099979770,"Herpesvirus hominis was isolated from the trigeminal ganglion obtained at autopsy from 1 of 22 patients with no clinical evidence of active herpetic disease, and from one patient with malignant lymphoma who died with herpes zoster on the abdomen, pulmonary cytomegalic inclusion disease, and possible oral herpes simplex. Virus was isolated by cocultivation of explants of ganglion with monolayers of Vero green monkey kidney cells and required 3 weeks of culture before viral cytopathic effects were evident. These observations support the concept that latent infection of sensory ganglia may be the source of virus in recurrent herpetic disease in man."
https://openalex.org/W1560876437,"Abstract Growth stops at confluency in mouse 3T3 cells and in MA308 human diploid fibroblasts even with frequent changes of media. Accompanying this cessation of growth is an increase in the endogenous levels of cyclic adenosine 3',5' monophosphate (cyclic AMP). In WI38 human diploid fibroblasts cyclic AMP levels do not rise as the cells grow to high densities with frequent media renewals: however, if the medium is not replenished, cyclic AMP levels rise as growth slows, presumably due to depletion of some serum factor. Initiation of DNA synthesis in confluent 3T3 cells by the addition of fresh serum is preceded by a decrease in cyclic AMP levels. The cyclic AMP levels also decrease following addition of trypsin or insulin, agents which stimulate DNA synthesis and cell growth. Prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) which inhibits cell growth in L-929 cells, raises cyclic AMP levels. Insulin alone has no effect, but when added with PGE1 it will partially prevent the elevation of cyclic AMP levels and corresponding inhibition of growth. The results give further support for the proposal that cyclic AMP regulates cell growth and mediates contact inhibition of growth."
https://openalex.org/W1546446844,"Abstract Soluble cytochrome oxidase has been prepared from the Keilin-Hartree preparation of bovine heart by sequential fragmentation of the respiratory chain. The procedure involves a prior extraction with 1% cholate which selectively solubilizes the segment containing the antimycin A-sensitive cytochrome b-c1 segment and succinate dehydrogenase. The cytochrome oxidase remaining in the particle is solubilized by 2% cholate in the presence of 0.25 saturation of ammonium sulfate and then further purified by ammonium sulfate fractionation. The procedure can be completed in 24 hours. The first order velocity constant of the purified oxidase is approximately 16 s-1 mg-1 of protein in a 3-ml system using reduced cytochrome c as the reductant at pH 5.7. The purified preparation contains approximately 11 nmoles of heme a per mg of protein and about 20% of lipid (w/w). The ratio of copper to heme a is 1.05. Amino acid composition of two preparations of oxidase indicates the protein to be slightly basic. The oxidase exhibits essentially only one sedimenting peak in ultracentrifugation experiments; its hydrodynamic data obtained in 0.1 m phosphate, containing 0.25% Emasol-1130 and 0.25% cholate, give a molecular weight of 4.3 x 105 (lipid included). However, in the sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis at least five major bands were observed. Spectra of the oxidized and the reduced oxidase and the effect of Emasol-1130 on the oxidized spectrum are presented. The oxidase preparation showed absorption maxima at 830, 598, 520, 419, and 280 nm in the oxidized form and 604, 520, 444, and 280 nm in the reduced form. The position of the Soret maximum, which varies from 418 to 425 nm in the oxidized enzyme as reported in the literature, was probably due to the effect of solvent used. The oxidase with the Soret peak at the longer wave length can be reversed to 418 nm by addition of Tween-80 or decrease of the Emasol concentration."
https://openalex.org/W1557081159,"Abstract Adenosine and 2'-deoxyadenosine at concentrations in the range of 5 to 50 µm inhibited the activation of adenylate cyclase activity in fat cell ghosts by norepinephrine. 2',5'-Dideoxyadenosine was more potent than adenosine while arabinosyl adenosine, 3'-deoxyadenosine, and 2-fluoroadenosine were equi-potent to adenosine as inhibitors of adenylate cyclase. Adenine was inactive as an inhibitor of adenylate cyclase along with nucleosides such as phenylisopropyl adenosine, inosine, 2'-deoxyinosine, guanosine, and 2'-deoxyguanosine. Adenosine, 2'-deoxyadenosine, and 2-fluoroadenosine were also inhibitors of the low Km phosphodiesterase found in the supernatant fraction obtained after centrifugation of fat cell homogenates. The large accumulation of cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP) seen in fat cells incubated for 5 min with catecholamines plus theophylline was markedly inhibited by 2',5'-dideoxyadenosine, adenosine, and 2-fluoroadenosine. The small increase in cyclic AMP due to norepinephrine or theophylline alone was also blocked by adenosine and 2',5'-dideoxyadenosine. However, there was no correlation between the effects of the nucleosides on cyclic AMP accumulation and lipolysis since 2',5'-dideoxyadenosine did not inhibit lipolysis. Adenosine inhibited the lipolytic action of theophylline or low concentrations of norepinephrine but did not inhibit the lipolytic action of higher concentrations of norepinephrine under conditions in which it virtually abolished the increase in cyclic AMP accumulation due to norepinephrine. These data indicate that marked inhibition by nucleosides of the increase in total cyclic AMP accumulation seen 5 min after the addition of theophylline, norepinephrine, or norepinephrine plus theophylline is not necessarily associated with any decrease in lipolysis. Apparently most of the increased cyclic AMP accumulation seen in the presence of lipolytic agents is unrelated to the regulation of lipolysis. The effect of adenosine and related nucleosides on cyclic AMP accumulation suggest that they may play a physiological role as feedback regulators of fat cell adenylate cyclase."
https://openalex.org/W1567714394,"The interaction of a protein inhibitor with the catalytic subunit derived from adenosine 3′,5′-monophosphate-dependent protein kinase is described. A kinetic analysis of casein phosphorylation in the presence of inhibitor reveals a noncompetitive interaction between the inhibitor and the catalytic subunit substrates, ATP and casein. The inhibitor does not function by destroying ATP nor by acting as a phosphoprotein phosphatase. The inhibitor is equally effective when protein kinase is assayed with various protein substrates. Catalytic subunit activity is inhibited to the same plateau level by the inhibitor and by regulatory subunit derived from adenosine 3′,5′-monophosphate-dependent protein kinase. The inhibitor interaction with the catalytic subunit prevents the catalytic subunit-induced release of adenosine 3′,5′-monophosphate from the regulatory subunit."
https://openalex.org/W1608221212,"A model is proposed to account for the occurrence of both slow transient kinetics and cooperativity in a monomeric, single-site enzyme. This slow transition model incorporates one reaction of the enzyme, in addition to normal catalytic steps, which is slower than other steps in the mechanism and is influenced by substrate. The slow reaction step may be an isomerization (conformation change), a dissociation-association, or binding of another ligand (modifier). Analysis of steady state kinetics and simulation studies for the slow isomerization mechanism have demonstrated that both positive and negative cooperativity can occur with either bursts or lags of enzyme activity. Examination of various combinations of rate constants have illustrated the dependence of cooperativity of the system on changes in certain rate constants. For example, a necessary condition for cooperativity in this model requires that both the binding and the isomerization steps of the mechanism be in a steady state but not at equilibrium. Modifiers could potentially shift the extent or type of cooperativity. The combination of slow transitions with homotropic, sitesite interaction could generate several types of complex, cooperative kinetics. Whenever a transient is observed in a progress curve the contribution of the slow transition model to cooperativity of the kinetics should be assessed. The results of binding studies, initial (pre-transition) velocity measurements, and the effects of factors (e.g. pH, temperature, modifiers) on the half-time of the transient should be capable of determining the extent of the contribution of the slow transition to cooperativity. A table of 10 enzymes which show both transients and cooperativity suggests that these phenomena do occur together and may be related mechanistically through the slow transition mechanism. Thus, in those cases in which a slow transition occurs, the transition may be responsible for nonlinear, double reciprocal plots of the steady state kinetics without requiring interactions between more than one site."
https://openalex.org/W1572683811,"Abstract Two phytohemagglutinins (PHA) with similar specificities for cell surface carbohydrate receptors were partially purified from the commercial mushroom Agaricus bisporus. One of the PHAs, which was greater than 90% pure, was iodinated and used in binding studies to determine the number of receptor sites on different cell types. Human erythrocytes contained 6.8 x 106 receptors per cell, whereas normal human lymphocytes contained 12.7 x 106 receptors and lymphocytes from patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia had 2.8 x 106 receptors. The ratio of A. bisporus PHA receptors to Phaseolus vulgaris E-PHA receptors was lower on lymphocytes than on erythrocytes, indicating a different surface structure of these two cell types. Although the A. bisporus PHA bound to lymphocytes, it did not act as a mitogen. Trypsin treatment of human erythrocytes resulted in a 50% decrease in the number of mushroom PHA molecules bound to the cells. The glycopeptide material released from the cells by trypsin was a potent haptene inhibitor of mushroom PHA, binding to cells. Removal of the terminal sialic acid residues from the glycopeptide increased its haptene inhibitory activity 8-fold. All of the haptene inhibitory activity of the glycopeptide was due to the O-glycosidically linked oligosaccharides having the structure galactose (β1,3)/→ N-acetylgalactosamine → serine (or threonine). Removal of the galactose by either β-galactosidase or periodate oxidation destroyed all haptene inhibitory activity. The intact glycopeptide was 15,000 times more potent as a haptene inhibitor than the simple sugars galactose and N-acetylgalactosamine, and 65 times more potent than the disaccharide galactose (β1,3)/→ N-acetylgalactosamine. The N-linked oligosaccharide chain of the trypsin-released glycopeptide, which is the receptor for the PHAs of P. vulgaris and Lens culinaris, was devoid of haptene inhibitory activity toward A. bisporus PHA."

Sodium is required by these high-affinity transports, but not by the low-affinity transports for these and other amino acids. The sodium-requiring amino acid uptake systems label unique synaptosomal fractions. Observations suggest that these amino acids serve specific synaptic functions, presumably as neurotransmitters."
https://openalex.org/W1974798427,"The chromosomal location of one of the two murine leukemia virus-inducing loci of AKR mice has been determined. The locus, which appears to be the integrated genome of the virus, is designated Akv-1, and is on linkage group 1, 12 map units from Gpi-1, with gene order c-Gpi-1-Akv-1. This identification of a closely linked gene whose phenotype is independent of virus expression should facilitate analysis of the biologic importance of the Akv-1 locus."
https://openalex.org/W1582078735,"Abstract Sulfite oxidase (EC 1.8.3.1) has been purified from chicken liver by modification of a procedure previously applied to bovine liver. The enzyme appears homogeneous as judged by its behavior in sedimentation velocity experiments and polyacrylamide disc gel electrophoresis. A new activity stain for the enzyme on acrylamide gels is described. Despite its apparent homogeneity, the enzyme consistently behaves in a heterogeneous manner in sedimentation equilibrium experiments, suggesting an associating system whose state of association depends on both enzyme concentration and anion content. The subunit molecular weight, determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate disc gel electrophoresis, is 55,000. The amino acid composition of the purified enzyme is reported. The absorption spectrum of the enzyme reveals the presence of a b5-like cytochrome, while chemical analysis and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra indicate that molybdenum functions as a second prosthetic group. The kinetics of the reaction of the enzyme with sulfite and cytochrome c are consistent with a ping-pong mechanism. The EPR signal from the molybdenum center of the enzyme displays a pH titration behavior similar to that of the bovine enzyme. In addition, the shape of the signal is extremely sensitive to the presence of anions. The heme EPR signal is very similar to that reported for cytochrome b5. The enzyme has also been partially purified from human liver, wheat germ, and Thiobacillus thioparus; each of these preparations displays a sulfite-dependent molybdenum EPR signal."
https://openalex.org/W1518494269,"Abstract Phenylalanine hydroxylase that is essentially pure contains 1 to 2 moles of iron per mole of enzyme (assuming a molecular weight of 100,000). Electron spin resonance (ESR) studies have shown that the iron is present in the high spin ferric form. The addition of substrates (i.e. phenylalanine and dimethyltetrahydropterin) causes the signal for this form to disappear. The iron, 50 to 80%, can be removed by treatment of sucrose gradient purified enzyme with o-phenanthroline and cysteine; the loss of iron leads to the loss of enzymatic activity. The enzyme activity is restored by FeCl2 with half-maximum restoration achieved at 5 x 10-5 m FeCl2. Mercurous, nickelous, cobalt, manganese, cupric, chromium, cadmium, and zinc ions are ineffective in restoring activity to the apoenzyme (o-phenanthroline-treated enzyme). As judged by gel electrophoresis, the apoenzyme has the same charge and molecular weight as the holoenzyme. The apoenzyme, however, is much less stabile at 25° than the holoenzyme; FeCl2 restored the original stability to the apoenzyme. Furthermore, the apoenzyme has only three free cysteines per 50,000 molecular weight subunit, whereas the holoenzyme has five cysteines per subunit. The amino acid composition of the enzyme was also determined."
https://openalex.org/W1611184013,"Abstract Kinetic and equilibrium data for the binding of azide, imidazole, and pyridine to horse heart ferricytochrome c have been obtained by conventional spectrophotometric and stopped flow techniques. The stability constants of the 1:1 complexes formed between ferricytochrome c and the ligands are: azide, 4.5 m-1; imidazole, 15.3 m-1; and pyridine, 2.4 m-1, at 25°, pH 7, and 1.0 m ionic strength. These measurements are consistent with a model in which the added ligands bind to the iron by displacing the coordinated methionine-80. The kinetic data indicate a rate constant of about 60 s-1 for the rupture of the iron-sulfur bond."
https://openalex.org/W1594016069,"Abstract Cyclic guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cyclic GMP) levels were determined in dog thyroid slices using the protein-binding method. [3H]Guanine incorporation into cyclic GMP was also determined by thin layer chromatography. Basal levels of cyclic GMP in dog thyroid slices were usually 10 to 30 pmoles per g wet tissue. These values were at least 10-fold lower than the cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP) levels. Cyclic GMP levels were significantly increased by acetylcholine (5.5 x 10-7 m to 5.5 x 10-5 m) and NaF (10-2 m) after a 1-min incubation. Increases (5 to 10-fold) were observed after 5- and 20-min incubations with acetylcholine (5.5 x 10-5 m) and after a 20-min incubation with NaF (10-2 m). Neither thyroid-stimulating hormone (100 milliunits per ml) nor prostaglandin E1 (2.8 x 10-5 m) increased cyclic GMP levels during 1-,5-, and 20-min incubations. Acetylcholine and NaF also increased [3H]guanine incorporation into cyclic GMP. The effect of acetylcholine was inhibited by atropine (1.6 x 10-4 m). Acetylcholine and NaF had little or no effect on cyclic AMP levels, while thyroid-stimulating hormone and prostaglandin E1 markedly increased cyclic AMP concentrations. In liver slices of the rat, acetylcholine increased cyclic GMP levels 2-fold, but NaF had no effect. These results indicate that the levels of cyclic GMP and cyclic AMP in dog thyroid slices are regulated by separate hormonal and metabolic mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W1568953854,"Abstract The neutral glycosphingolipids and the gangliosides of normal 3T3 mouse fibroblasts, one polyoma-transformed, and three SV40-transformed clonal isolates have been examined. The normal 3T3 cells contained mono- and dihexosylceramides and a complex pattern of gangliosides. The carbohydrate and fatty acid compositions of these neutral glycosphingolipids and of the principal gangliosides were determined and partial structures for these compounds are proposed. One polyoma-transformed (3T3-Py6) and one SV40-transformed derivative cell line (3T3-SV-479) were found to exhibit marked simplification of ganglioside pattern as compared with the control cells, a finding in agreement with that of a previous study (Brady, R. O., and Mora, P. T. (1970) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 218, 308). Two other clonal isolates of SV40-transformed cells (3T3-SV-A26 and 3T3-SV-CE56) exhibited complex patterns of gangliosides, generally similar to those found in the control cells, but showing a marked increase of the ganglioside GD1a. Possible explanations for these observations are discussed. No correlation was detected between the complexity of the glycosphingolipid pattern and the saturation density obtained with the cells studied. Experiments using [1-14C]-glucosamine as a precursor confirmed the ability of control and transformed cells to synthesize their complement of gangliosides. Plasma membrane fractions of 3T3 cells were found to be enriched 3-fold with respect to the various gangliosides detected in the whole cells. Certain gangliosides of the control and 3T3-Py6 cells were susceptible to the action of neuraminidase in a membrane-bound state."

https://openalex.org/W1502971488,"Abstract Rat thymocytes, isolated from 13- to 19-day-old animals, responded to insulin with an increased influx of α-aminoisobutyric acid (AIB). Insulin was effective at 1 nm; the half-maximal response was 40 nm, and a maximal response was seen at 1 µm. Biologically inactive insulin derivatives as well as adrenocorticotropic hormone and glucagon were without effect. 125I-Insulin bound specifically to rat thymocyte receptors and was displaced by unlabeled insulin at 1 nm. The insulin concentration that produced half-maximal displacement of 125I-insulin was 20 nm, and complete displacement was seen at 1 µm. Other hormones or inactive insulin derivatives had trivial effects. Insulin increased AIB influx by both raising the maximal influx capacity (Jmax) and lowering the concentration of AIB at which influx was half maximal (Km); insulin did not affect AIB fractional efflux. The full effect of insulin on influx was not immediate; rather, stimulation of influx increased linearly with time. Cycloheximide both inhibited basal AIB influx and reduced the response to insulin. Insulin had only a small effect on [14C]leucine incorporation into cellular proteins and had no effect on the uptake of 3-O-methylglucose. The data suggest that (a) insulin stimulation of AIB transport on rat thymocytes correlates in sensitivity and specificity with 125I-insulin binding to receptors, and (b) insulin stimulation of AIB influx may be mediated by changes in synthesis or degradation of the AIB transport apparatus."
https://openalex.org/W1618700385,"Abstract The interaction of Mn2+ and nucleotides with Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I has been examined by kinetic and magnetic resonance techniques. Electron paramagnetic resonance studies show that the enzyme binds Mn2+ at one tight binding active site (Kd ≤1 µm, Ka = 1.2 µm), four ± one intermediate sites (Kd = 29 µm), and 20 weak inhibitory sites (Kd = 830 µm; Ki = 600 µm). The effect of bound Mn2+ on the longitudinal relaxation rate of water protons is enhanced by factors of 9.5 (first site), 16.1 (second site), 7.1 (third to fifth sites), and 3.5 (6th to 19th sites). Comparison of kinetic and binding data suggests that the tight Mn2+ site and possibly the intermediate Mn2+ sites function in polymerization. From competition studies with EPR and proton relaxation rate, Mg2+ displaces Mn2+ from the tight and intermediate sites. dTMP and dTTP bind to the tight Mn2+ site with equal affinity (K3 = 100 µm) and decrease the enhancement by 37 and 23%, respectively. In contrast, at the intermediate Mn2+ sites, dTTP (K3 = 5 µm) binds more tightly by an order of magnitude than dTMP (K3 = 50 µm) but both nucleotides produce similar lowering (28%) of the enhancement factors. These results suggest the formation of multiple e-Mn-nucleotide bridge complexes through the α-phosphoryl group at both the tight and intermediate Mn2+ sites. Coordination of the α-phosphoryl group of dTTP by e-Mn would increase its susceptibility to nucleophilic attack, thus facilitating nucleotidyl transfer. In contrast, no evidence is obtained for a role of Mn2+ in the binding of DNA to the enzyme. The interaction of multiple molecules of dTTP with the enzyme would permit the prealignment of substrate molecules on the enzyme prior to polymerization."

The development of the intranuclear inclusions is thus an acute manifestation of lead poisoning, not a delayed one, as has been thought hitherto. Cytoplasmic structures resembling the intranuclear inclusions and situated in the vicinity of endoplasmic reticulum were regularly found in cells bearing the pathognomonic intranuclear inclusions. The latter and the cytoplasmic structures may be derived from a common precursor, perhaps a soluble protein-lead complex."

Normal chick embryo DNA was distinctly different, but contained sequences at least partially homologous to some fraction of the viral RNA."

https://openalex.org/W2031460737,"An analog of angiotensin II, [Sar(1), Ile(8)]-angiotensin II, has a potent and long-lasting competitive antagonistic effect against angiotensin II when tested for its myotropic action on the isolated rabbit aorta and for its effect on blood pressure in anesthetized cats and dogs. Compared to [Ile(8)]-angiotensin II, the new analog has equal antagonistic potency on the isolated system but a much greater potency in vivo. It is assumed that sarcosine in position 1 protects the peptide against enzymatic degradation and enhances its half-life. This study demonstrates that the modification in both positions 1 and 8 are important for the in vivo antagonistic potencies of angiotensin analogs."
https://openalex.org/W1539148667,"The effect of heparin on the activity of lipoprotein lipase from bovine milk was investigated under conditions varying with regard to ionic strength, purity of enzyme, and mode of substrate activation. A crude enzyme (dialyzed skim milk) was studied, along with a purified preparation obtained by affinity chromatography on a column of heparin-substituted agarose. Serum, high density lipoproteins (HDL3), or very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) were used as activators. The activity of the enzyme varied with the ionic strength of the incubation medium. Maximal activity occurred at physiological salt concentration (I 0.16); at higher ionic strength the activity of the enzyme was depressed. This depression, due to inhibition along with inactivation of the enzyme, was impeded in the presence of heparin. The purified enzyme preparation was activated to about the same extent by either HDL3, VLDL, or serum. The effect of heparin on the lipolytic activities thus attained was relatively small. In contrast, the activity of the crude enzyme was extensively inhibited in the presence of serum but not in the presence of HDL3 or VLDL. The inhibitory effect of serum was completely abolished by the addition of small amounts of heparin. The data obtained indicate that heparin may increase the activity of lipoprotein lipase, but only under otherwise suboptimal conditions. It is concluded that heparin stabilizes rather than stimulates the enzyme; furthermore, the effect of inhibitors is partly or completely abolished. Both enzyme preparations were shown to contain small amounts of endogenous heparin-like material. The functional significance of these components is discussed."

https://openalex.org/W2003341111,"Changes in compliance of the tympanic membrane have been detected in normal human sleep, presumably due to spontaneous contraction of the stapedius and tensor tympani muscles of the middle ear. In the waking state, these muscles generally respond to loud sound (middle ear reflex). Middle ear muscle activity typically erupts before or at the onset of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and persists throughout the REM period in a discontinuous pattern resembling that exhibited by rapid eye movements. Approximately 80 percent of all nocturnal middle ear muscle activity is contained in REM sleep. Half of the remaining 20 percent occurs in the 10-minute intervals just prior to the onset of REM sleep. Middle ear muscle activity is often associated with other phasic events such as momentary enhancement of electromyogram inhibition, apnea, and K complexes. Rapid eye movements and middle ear muscle activity, though significantly correlated in REM sleep, are not always simultaneous."
https://openalex.org/W1538561427,"Abstract The ability of rel+ cell strains of Escherichia coli to take up nucleosides and bases and convert them to the corresponding ribonucleoside 5'-triphosphates is qualitatively dependent upon amino acids, much the same as the ability to accumulate RNA. Restriction of uptake in this case occurs under the same conditions that elicit guanosine 5'-diphosphate, 2'- or 3'-diphosphate (ppGpp) accumulation and both phenomena are reversed by addition of chloramphenicol. The P-ribose-PP-dependent transport of purine nucleosides and bases into membrane vesicles is inhibited by ppGpp, as are membrane-bound purine phosphoribosyltransferase activities. The degree of inhibition differs for different substrates; for purines, inhibition approximates the uptake restrictions observed in whole cells. Enzyme and membrane preparations obtained from rel+ and rel- cells were equally inhibited by ppGpp. Purified soluble 6-hydroxy purine phosphoribosyltransferase, which mediates membranous uptake of 6-hydroxy purines, is inhibited by ppGpp. Inhibition is not strictly competitive, but appears to be less severe at high P-ribose-PP levels. Adenine phosphoribosyltransferase was only mildly inhibited by ppGpp. The inhibitory effects of ppGpp on purine transport due to inhibition of purine phosphoribosyltransferase can account for purine uptake restrictions observed under different physiological conditions in whole cells."
https://openalex.org/W1571569886,"Abstract We have studied some biochemical aspects of the differentation of chick embryonic skeletal muscle cells in cell culture. Cultures are initiated in a medium that supports cell fusion and muscle cell differentiation. After 40 to 44 hours of culture, the normal onset of cell fusion is prevented by exchanging the medium for one low in Ca++ (80 µm). After a further 24 hours, high Ca++ (880 µm) standard medium is restored and cell fusion proceeds, followed by synthesis of creatine kinase and myokinase. Before cell fusion is allowed to proceed, cultures are treated with 5-bromotubercidin or 5-fluorouridine, nucleoside inhibitors of RNA synthesis. 5-Fluorouridine is an irreversible inhibitor of ribosomal RNA synthesis but does not inhibit synthesis of heterogeneous nuclear RNA, or by inference, messenger RNA. 5-Bromotubercidin is a reversible inhibitor of the synthesis of both ribosomal RNA and heterogeneous nuclear RNA and of mRNA. In cultures treated with 5-fluorouridine cell fusion and synthesis of creatine kinase and myokinase proceed as in control cultures. In cultures treated briefly (8 hours) with 5-bromotubercidin, cell fusion and synthesis of creatine kinase and myokinase are delayed and lag about 16 hours behind control cultures. We conclude: (a) continuing synthesis of ribosomal RNA (or ribosomes) is not necessary for expression of differentiated muscle properties, i.e. cell fusion and enzyme synthesis. (b) After cultures are refed high Ca++ medium (permissive for cell fusion) there must be synthesis of one or more messenger type RNA's before differentiated properties are expressed. (c) Synthesis and translation to protein of the messenger RNA(s) needed for the expression of differentiated muscle properties does not require concomitant synthesis of ribosomal RNA (or ribosomes). Cultures of differentiating muscle cells have been infected with the RNA tumor virus Schmidt-Ruppin RSV (SR-RSV). Myotubes in infected cultures become progressively vacuolated and within 3 to 4 days after infection by SR-RSV the differentiated myotubes are destroyed. Cell fusion and synthesis of muscle enzymes continue for 2 to 3 days after cultures are infected with SR-RSV. The vacuolization and destruction of myotubes infected by SR-RSV seems to be a response analogous to the morphological transformation occurring in RSV-infected fibroblasts. The differentiated muscle cell, unlike the fibroblast, is not able to respond in a manner which would balance the deleterious effects of this tumor virus and is subsequently destroyed. Since expression of differentiated properties can begin at least 24 hours after infection by SR-RSV, it does not seem likely that transformation by SR-RSV produces an immediate effect on cell differentiation at the level of DNA."
https://openalex.org/W1551424798,"Abstract A specific, highly sensitive radioimmunoassay has been developed for human skin collagenase. The assay is based upon competition of purified collagenase, or collagenase of tissue extracts, with isotopically labeled purified enzyme for specific antibody binding sites after which a second antibody precipitation is used to separate bound 125I-labeled human skin collagenase from free enzyme. The radioimmunoassay provides a range of 2 to 40 ng for determining enzyme concentration and has permitted quantitation of collagenase in crude tissue extracts of human skin under conditions in which enzymatic activity cannot be detected. In addition, other human collagenases can also be measured with 200 to 300 times greater sensitivity than can be achieved by enzymatic techniques. In comparative studies, the ability of a variety of human and animal collagenases to compete with 125I-labeled human skin collagenase for antibody binding sites has been assessed as a measure of the similarity between these enzymes. Human synovial, gingival, and granulocytic collagenases are identical in their cross-reactivity with human skin collagenase in the immunoassay, supporting the concept that extensive homologies probably exist among collagenases from various human organs. Although collagenase from another primate, the baboon, shows marked cross-reactivity with the human enzymes, collagenases from more distantly related species cross-react only at protein concentrations which are 20 to 30 times greater than those needed to detect the human enzymes. These findings suggest that fewer similarities to the human enzymes will be found when purified preparations of these animal collagenases become available."
https://openalex.org/W1493352487,"Cell-free extracts of Pseudomonas putida, grown with syringic acid as carbon source, catalyzed the oxidation of 1 mole of gallate (3,4,5-trihydroxybenzoate) by 1 mole of oxygen to give 2 moles of pyruvate and 1 mole of carbon dioxide. Oxaloacetate, formed as an intermediate in reactions, could be reduced quantitatively when NADH and sufficient malate dehydrogenase were added, despite the presence in extracts of oxaloacetate decarboxylase. With these conditions of assay it was shown that oxaloacetate was the precursor of half of the pyruvate formed from gallate. Similarly, when 1 mole of gallate was first oxidized by protocatechuate 4,5-oxygenase purified from Pseudomonas testosteroni and was then degraded by cell-free extracts, 1 mole of oxaloacetate and 1 mole of pyruvate were again formed. Although gallate oxygenase proved too labile to isolate, it was concluded from these results that the enzyme gave the same ring fission product as that obtained by the action of protocatechuate 4,5-oxygenase on gallate, namely 4-carboxy-2-hydroxy-cis,cis-muconic acid. This compound appeared to undergo enzymic hydration to give 4-carboxy-4-hydroxy-2-oxoadipate which was then cleaved to oxaloacetate and pyruvate. Cell-free extracts oxidized 3-O-methylgallate, but protocatechuate (3,4-dihydroxybenzoate), 5-carboxy-3,4-dihydroxy benzoate and 3,4-dihydroxy-5-methylbenzoate were not attacked. Syringic acid was oxidized only in the presence of substrate amounts of NADH, when 2 moles of oxygen were taken up and 1 mole of pyruvate appeared; additional pyruvate was formed by a much slower reaction. There was no requirement for added NADH when concentrated cell extracts were used to oxidize syringate. These and other observations indicate that the C-5 methoxyl group of syringate was oxidized by an O-demethylase. The benzene nucleus of the resulting 3-O-methylgallate was then cleaved between C-3 and C-4 to give, as final products, pyruvate and a compound presumed to be a monomethyl ester of oxaloacetic acid. The substrate specificity of syringate O-demethylase was studied in experiments with intact cells."

https://openalex.org/W1601356524,"Abstract Evidence is presented for the presence of an enzyme, α-N-acetylgalactosaminyl oligosaccharase in filtrates of Clostridium perfringens. Action of this enzyme on hog submaxillary glycoprotein results in the release of a disaccharide, characterized as 3-O-β-d-galactopyranosyl-2-acetamido-2-deoxy-d-galactose. The possibility that this oligosaccharide has resulted from transgalactosylation has been eliminated. Enzymatic treatment of several glycoproteins and blood group substances from miscellaneous sources also resulted in the production of this oligosaccharide. Since in the blood group substances N-acetylgalactosamine at the reducing end of the oligosaccharide chain is α-linked to the hydroxy amino acids of the protein core, we have here a very useful α-N-acetyl-d-galactosaminyl oligosaccharase for structural studies of the carbohydrate-protein linkage in the blood group substances and in glycoproteins."
https://openalex.org/W1539874872,"Abstract Phosphorylase phosphatase from rabbit skeletal muscle, when purified 700-fold, dephosphorylated the 22,000 molecular weight subunit of troponin (TNI). The endogenous phosphate in TNI and that incorporated by phosphorylase kinase were both totally removed at identical rates. Five criteria were established to show that dephosphorylation of TNI was catalyzed by phosphorylase phosphatase and not a contaminant in the preparation: (a) co-purification of TNIand phosphorylase-phosphatase activities; (b) identical patterns of the activities on polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; (c) parallel heat denaturation and (d) fluoride inhibition of the activities; (e) competitive effects when both TNI and phosphorylase a were present. The Km for phosphorylase a was 6.8 µm, and 21.2 µm for TNI. The Vmax with TNI was approximately 4-fold greater than with phosphorylase a."

https://openalex.org/W1529720517,"Abstract Two eukaryotic cytochrome c components, ca and cb, were purified from the thermophilic fungus Humicola lanuginosa. These proteins appear to differ only in the degree of methylation of lysyl amino groups. The ca component is the first cytochrome c of fungal origin found to contain 2 residues of methylated lysine. The complete amino acid sequence of H. lanuginosa cytochrome ca, the major component, was established. The protein consists of a single polypeptide chain of 111 residues. On alignment with vertebrate cytochromes c, the peptide chain extends for 8 residues at the amino-terminal end. As with other fungal cytochromes c of known sequence, residue 104 is deleted. Considering the region of residues 1 through 103, H. lanuginosa cytochrome ca most closely resembles the primary structure of Neurospora crassa cytochrome c. The two proteins show 18 differences. H. lanuginosa cytochrome ca contains a phenylalanyl residue at position 74. Other cytochromes c of known sequence contain a constant segment from residues 70 to 80, with a tyrosyl residue situated at position 74."
https://openalex.org/W1558935136,"Abstract The oxidation of the half-reduced cyanide complex of cytochrome oxidase (a2+·Cu1+·a33+CN) by ferricyanide showed a one to one correlation between the formation of the 830-nm absorption band and the generation of the EPR Cu(II) signal at g = 2. Both required 1.0 mole of ferricyanide per mole of cytochrome oxidase of 4 oxidation equivalents. On the other hand, the titration measured at 603 nm required 2.4 moles of oxidant; the fractional ratio apparently resulted from absorbance contribution by the Cu(II) chromophore. The titration curves measured at 830 nm and by EPR for the fully reduced cyanide complex (a2+·Cu1+·a32+CN) were sigmoidal. These and other observations suggest that significant heme-copper interaction exists between the EPR-sensitive copper chromophore and cytochrome a on one hand and cytochrome a3 on the other. Structurally and functionally the EPR-sensitive copper which shows the 830-nm absorption band is most likely to be sandwiched between cytochromes a and a3, whereas the EPR-insensitive copper, which does not contribute to the 830-nm band, may serve only as an electron sink. Some of the divergent results reported in the literature may be reconciled on the basis of these observations."

Some properties of this enzyme are described. The possibility is suggested that this phosphatase and a previously described C55-isoprenoid alcohol phosphokinase represent a mechanism for regulation of cell wall synthesis in S. aureus.
https://openalex.org/W1571432956,"Abstract A procedure is described for the purification of CDP-d-glucose oxidoreductase which catalyzes formation of CDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-d-glucose and for enzymes E1 and E3 which catalyze the further reduction to CDP-4-keto-3,6-dideoxy-d-glucose. All three enzymes have been purified to homogeneity as judged by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate. CDP-d-glucose oxidoreductase has been shown to consist of two identical subunits of molecular weight of about 43,000 per subunit. Enzymes E1 and E3 consist of simple polypeptide chains of molecular weight of about 61,000 and 41,000, respectively. Preliminary studies on the mechanism of the reaction suggest that enzyme E1 binds the substrate and that pyridoxamine 5'-phosphate is essential for the binding. Enzyme E3 has been shown to possess NADH oxidase activity and may be the reductase. A mechanism involving participation of the essential cofactor, pyridoxamine-5'-phosphate, is discussed."

https://openalex.org/W1630602875,"Abstract Fructose 1,6-diphosphatase has been isolated from swine kidney extracts by a procedure which yields large quantities of homogeneous enzyme. The purified preparation has an extinction coefficient (E280nm1%) of 8.9 in 0.05 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 and a specific activity of 25 to 30 µmoles per min per mg. The molecular weight of the native protein, as determined by sedimentation velocity, sedimentation equilibrium analysis, sucrose gradient centrifugation, and gel filtration on Sephadex G-200 is 130,000 ± 2,500. Sedimentation equilibrium analysis of the enzyme denatured in 4 m guanidine hydrochloride indicated that four polypeptide chains might be present. These results were confirmed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate which showed that the native enzyme contained 4 identical subunits with molecular weights of 34,000 ± 1,500. Further evidence for the presence of 4 subunits was obtained from a determination of the number of peptides formed after digestion of the enzyme with trypsin. The COOH-terminal amino acid residues of all 4 subunits were identified as alanine by hydrozinolysis and by digestion with carboxypeptidases. The NH2-terminal amino acid was serine. Quantitative Edman degradations on oxidized denatured samples showed that the native enzyme contained 4 serine NH2-terminal residues per mole. All of the determinations gave nearly the same values for the subunit molecular weight of about 34,000, which is in good agreement with a tetrameric structure for the native enzyme with a molecular weight of 130,000. Examination of fructose 1,6-diphosphatase in the electron microscope by the negative staining technique revealed the presence of a flattened ellipsoidal particle with cross-section diameters of 60 and 120 A and a width of about 30 A."

https://openalex.org/W1501608760,"Abstract [Aspartic acid 43]-semisynthetic staphylococcal nuclease-T' is an active site analogue of native nuclease-T', the enzymically active proteolytic derivative of staphylococcal nuclease containing the noncovalently bound fragments nuclease-T-(6–48) (residues 6 through 48 of nuclease) and nuclease-T-(49–149) (residues 49 through 149). The semisynthetic analogue complex, which contains [aspartic acid 43]-synthetic-(6–47) in place of nuclease-T-(6–48), has been obtained by functional purification. This complex has an over-all folded structure similar to that of normal semisynthetic nuclease-T' but lacks enzymic activity. Nonetheless, [aspartic acid 43]-semisynthetic nuclease-T' binds the active site ligands deoxythymidine-3',5'-diphosphate (an inhibitor of nuclease and nuclease-T') and Ca++ (an ion essential for nuclease and nuclease-T' activity). Binding of ligands is interdependent, a property characteristic for native nuclease-T', but appears somewhat weaker than that for the native complex. Thus, replacement of glutamic acid 43 by aspartic acid causes limited but important steric changes in the active site region leading to the direct perturbation of the catalytic process. Based on these results, together with the prior knowledge that glutamic acid 43 is in the active site region in the crystal structure of nuclease and that nuclease and nuclease-T' have similar folded structures, it is concluded that glutamic acid 43 is critical for the proper organization of the active site in nuclease and nuclease-T'."

https://openalex.org/W1563402591,"Abstract Dibutyryl cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate(dibutyryl cyclic AMP), cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP), and prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) stimulated α-aminoisobutyric acid (AIB) influx in thymocytes from suckling rats. Dibutyryl cyclic AMP increased influx at concentrations as low as 30 µm; a maximal effect was seen at 1 mm. Cyclic AMP had 1% of the activity of its dibutyryl derivative. PGE1 increased AIB influx at concentrations as low as 30 nm. Dibutyryl cyclic AMP increased AIB influx by increasing the maximal influx capacity (Jmax) without affecting the Km. This is in contrast to the effect of insulin which, in addition to raising the Jmax, also lowers the Km. When insulin was added with either PGE1 or dibutyryl cyclic AMP, the effects were additive. PGE1 elevated thymocyte cyclic AMP levels, whereas insulin neither lowered basal cyclic AMP levels nor blocked the rise in cyclic AMP produced by PGE1. We concluded that (a) insulin increased AIB influx by a mechanism not involving changes in cyclic AMP levels, and (b) cyclic AMP and prostaglandin E1 increased AIB influx by a different mechanism than insulin."

https://openalex.org/W1493341619,"Abstract A particle-bound enzyme preparation from the fungus imperfectus, Cryptococcus laurentii, contains at least two different xylosyltransferases. One of these catalyzes the transfer of xylosyl units from UDP-xylose to endogenous cell envelope glycoproteins. The enzyme requires the disaccharide, 3-O-α-d-mannosyl-d-mannose, or the same structure at the terminal nonreducing end of an oligosaccharide as an acceptor. The xylosyl residue is transferred to the pentultimate mannosyl at the nonreducing end of the acceptor with the formation of a β-1,2 linkage. The product, 3-O-α-d-mannosyl-(2-O-β-d-xylosyl)-d-[3-14C]mannose, was synthesized, reduced with sodium borohydride, oxidized with periodate, again reduced, and then hydrolyzed. This procedure led to the formation of [14C]erythritol confirming the structure of the product. The xylosyltransferase has a pH optimum of 6.0 to 6.5. The apparent Km values for UDP-xylose and mannobiose are 1.4 mm and 19 mm, respectively. These properties, as well as the nature of the product formed, stability of the enzyme at 38°, and inhibition by nucleotides, clearly differentiate between this enzyme and a second xylosyltransferase that has been described for C. laurentii (Cohen, A., and Feingold, D. S. (1967) Biochemistry 6, 2933)."
https://openalex.org/W1986517961,"Cultures of human cells nonpermissive for mouse leukemia virus replication could not be induced to support virus replication by homologous fusion in the presence of Moloney leukemia virus. Human cells were also fused with permissive mouse cells, and the fate of the virus in heterokaryons was determined by a simultaneous autoradiography and fluorescent antibody technique. Heterokaryons containing the full chromosome complement of both cells were likewise nonpermissive for virus synthesis, but hybrids of human and mouse cells, which lacked up to half of the human chromosome complement, were permissive for virus synthesis. The results suggest that human cell genes can direct a repressive control over mouse leukemia virus replication."
https://openalex.org/W1661664464,"Abstract Glycogen phosphorylase has been studied in Rana pipiens eggs and embryos with regard to the nature of the enzyme, its control possibilites, and its involvement in preneurula development. On the basis of enzyme activity, immunological, and electrophoretic comparisons, R. pipiens egg phosphorylase is not wholly identical with the phosphorylases characteristic of skeletal muscle, liver, or kidney tissues. The possibility exists that the egg activity consists of a mixture of types or is a single type peculiar to the embryo. Amphibian egg phosphorylase possesses the same control possibilities as adult tissue forms. It can be activated by AMP. It appears to exist in active and inactive forms, the interconversion of which is catalyzed by endogenous factors having properties of a phosphorylase kinase and phosphorylase phosphatase. The egg phosphorylase kinase is capable of activating purified frog and rabbit muscle phosphorylase, and the purified rabbit muscle phosphorylase b kinase can activate the egg and frog muscle enzymes. However, the egg and rabbit muscle phosphatases are species specific. If the activity of the activated form of egg phosphorylase in the presence of AMP is assigned a value of 100%, its activity in the absence of AMP is 96%. The activity of the inactivated form in the presence of AMP is 35%. In the absence of AMP, the inactivated form has no activity. Phosphorylase in unfertilized R. pipiens eggs is mostly in the inactive form. Shortly after fertilization and at gastrulation, increases in activity and in the -AMP:+AMP activity ratio occur. A cyclic adenosine 3' ,5'-monophosphate-mediated control mechanism is possible as a cyclic AMP-activated protein kinase has been detected in the fractionated egg supernatant. This enzyme mimics the behavior of rabbit muscle phosphorylase kinase kinase."
