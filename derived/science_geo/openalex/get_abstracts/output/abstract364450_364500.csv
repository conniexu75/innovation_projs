https://openalex.org/W2123564569,"The human body is composed of diverse cell types with distinct functions. Although it is known that lineage specification depends on cell-specific gene expression, which in turn is driven by promoters, enhancers, insulators and other cis-regulatory DNA sequences for each gene, the relative roles of these regulatory elements in this process are not clear. We have previously developed a chromatin-immunoprecipitation-based microarray method (ChIP-chip) to locate promoters, enhancers and insulators in the human genome. Here we use the same approach to identify these elements in multiple cell types and investigate their roles in cell-type-specific gene expression. We observed that the chromatin state at promoters and CTCF-binding at insulators is largely invariant across diverse cell types. In contrast, enhancers are marked with highly cell-type-specific histone modification patterns, strongly correlate to cell-type-specific gene expression programs on a global scale, and are functionally active in a cell-type-specific manner. Our results define over 55,000 potential transcriptional enhancers in the human genome, significantly expanding the current catalogue of human enhancers and highlighting the role of these elements in cell-type-specific gene expression."

Here we monitored the spatiotemporal dynamics of CaMKII activation in individual dendritic spines during LTP using two-photon fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy, in combination with two-photon glutamate uncaging. Induction of LTP and associated spine enlargement in single spines triggered transient ( approximately 1 min) CaMKII activation restricted to the stimulated spines. CaMKII in spines was specifically activated by NMDA receptors and L-type voltage-sensitive calcium channels, presumably by nanodomain Ca(2+) near the channels, in response to glutamate uncaging and depolarization, respectively. The high degree of compartmentalization and channel specificity of CaMKII signalling allow stimuli-specific spatiotemporal patterns of CaMKII signalling and may be important for synapse-specificity of synaptic plasticity."

https://openalex.org/W2028966038,"Myostatin (Mstn) is a secreted growth factor expressed in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue that negatively regulates skeletal muscle mass. Mstn−/− mice have a dramatic increase in muscle mass, reduction in fat mass, and resistance to diet-induced and genetic obesity. To determine how Mstn deletion causes reduced adiposity and resistance to obesity, we analyzed substrate utilization and insulin sensitivity in Mstn−/− mice fed a standard chow. Despite reduced lipid oxidation in skeletal muscle, Mstn−/− mice had no change in the rate of whole body lipid oxidation. In contrast, Mstn−/− mice had increased glucose utilization and insulin sensitivity as measured by indirect calorimetry, glucose and insulin tolerance tests, and hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp. To determine whether these metabolic effects were due primarily to the loss of myostatin signaling in muscle or adipose tissue, we compared two transgenic mouse lines carrying a dominant negative activin IIB receptor expressed specifically in adipocytes or skeletal muscle. We found that inhibition of myostatin signaling in adipose tissue had no effect on body composition, weight gain, or glucose and insulin tolerance in mice fed a standard diet or a high-fat diet. In contrast, inhibition of myostatin signaling in skeletal muscle, like Mstn deletion, resulted in increased lean mass, decreased fat mass, improved glucose metabolism on standard and high-fat diets, and resistance to diet-induced obesity. Our results demonstrate that Mstn−/− mice have an increase in insulin sensitivity and glucose uptake, and that the reduction in adipose tissue mass in Mstn−/− mice is an indirect result of metabolic changes in skeletal muscle. These data suggest that increasing muscle mass by administration of myostatin antagonists may be a promising therapeutic target for treating patients with obesity or diabetes."

https://openalex.org/W1969660397,"The principles of natural protein engineering are obscured by overlapping functions and complexity accumulated through natural selection and evolution. Completely artificial proteins offer a clean slate on which to define and test these protein engineering principles, while recreating and extending natural functions. Here we introduce this method with the design of an oxygen transport protein, akin to human neuroglobin. Beginning with a simple and unnatural helix-forming sequence with just three different amino acids, we assembled a four-helix bundle, positioned histidines to bis-histidine ligate haems, and exploited helical rotation and glutamate burial on haem binding to introduce distal histidine strain and facilitate O2 binding. For stable oxygen binding without haem oxidation, water is excluded by simple packing of the protein interior and loops that reduce helical-interface mobility. O2 affinities and exchange timescales match natural globins with distal histidines, with the remarkable exception that O2 binds tighter than CO. In principle, the proteins that direct the heavy chemical work of the cell can be re-engineered to perform a host of other useful chemical reactions. In practice, natural proteins tend to accumulate complexity and fragility through natural selection, making it extremely difficult to re-engineer them for new purposes. Starting from a simple helix-forming sequence containing glutamate, lysine and leucine repeats, Koder et al. used de novo protein design to generate a simple unnatural oxygen transport protein, akin to human neuroglobin. The resulting four-helix bundle contains histidine residues at key positions to bind a haem cofactor, enabling the unnatural protein to bind to, and release, oxygen. The O2 on-rate, off-rate and dissociation constants are similar to those of human neuroglobin and other naturally occurring globins. The authors used de novo protein design to generate a simple unnatural oxygen transport protein, akin to human neuroglobin; the design strategy involved the assembly of a short helix-forming sequence into a four-helix bundle that contained histidine residues at key positions. The O2 on-rate, off-rate and dissociation constants are similar to those of human neuroglobin and other naturally occurring globins."
https://openalex.org/W2017126556,"Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is a prion disease affecting captive and free-ranging cervids (e.g. deer, elk, and moose). The mechanisms of CWD transmission are poorly understood, though bodily fluids are thought to play an important role. Here we report the presence of infectious prions in the urine and saliva of deer with chronic wasting disease (CWD). Prion infectivity was detected by bioassay of concentrated, dialyzed urine and saliva in transgenic mice expressing the cervid PrP gene (Tg[CerPrP] mice). In addition, PrPCWD was detected in pooled and concentrated urine by protein misfolding cyclic amplification (PMCA). The concentration of abnormal prion protein in bodily fluids was very low, as indicated by: undetectable PrPCWD levels by traditional assays (western blot, ELISA) and prolonged incubation periods and incomplete TSE attack rates in inoculated Tg(CerPrP) mice (373±3days in 2 of 9 urine-inoculated mice and 342±109 days in 8 of 9 saliva-inoculated mice). These findings help extend our understanding of CWD prion shedding and transmission and portend the detection of infectious prions in body fluids in other prion infections."

Mitochondrial abnormalities and deficiencies in oxidative phosphorylation have been reported in individuals with schizophrenia (SZ), bipolar disorder (BD), and major depressive disorder (MDD) in transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic studies. Several mutations in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequence have been reported in SZ and BD patients.Dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) from a cohort of 77 SZ, BD, and MDD subjects and age-matched controls (C) was studied for mtDNA sequence variations and heteroplasmy levels using Affymetrix mtDNA resequencing arrays. Heteroplasmy levels by microarray were compared to levels obtained with SNaPshot and allele specific real-time PCR. This study examined the association between brain pH and mtDNA alleles. The microarray resequencing of mtDNA was 100% concordant with conventional sequencing results for 103 mtDNA variants. The rate of synonymous base pair substitutions in the coding regions of the mtDNA genome was 22% higher (p = 0.0017) in DLPFC of individuals with SZ compared to controls. The association of brain pH and super haplogroup (U, K, UK) was significant (p = 0.004) and independent of postmortem interval time.Focusing on haplogroup and individual susceptibility factors in psychiatric disorders by considering mtDNA variants may lead to innovative treatments to improve mitochondrial health and brain function."
https://openalex.org/W2160933724,"The Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway plays essential roles in cell proliferation and differentiation, and deregulated β-catenin protein levels lead to many types of human cancers. On activation by Wnt, the Wnt co-receptor LDL receptor related protein 6 (LRP6) is phosphorylated at multiple conserved intracellular PPPSPXS motifs by glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) and casein kinase 1 (CK1), resulting in recruitment of the scaffolding protein Axin to LRP6. As a result, β-catenin phosphorylation by GSK3 is inhibited and β-catenin protein is stabilized. However, how LRP6 phosphorylation and the ensuing LRP6-Axin interaction lead to the inhibition of β-catenin phosphorylation by GSK3 is not fully understood. In this study, we reconstituted Axin-dependent β-catenin phosphorylation by GSK3 and CK1 in vitro using recombinant proteins, and found that the phosphorylated PPPSPXS peptides directly inhibit β-catenin phosphorylation by GSK3 in a sequence and phosphorylation-dependent manner. This inhibitory effect of phosphorylated PPPSPXS motifs is direct and specific for GSK3 phosphorylation of β-catenin at Ser33/Ser37/Thr41 but not for CK1 phosphorylation of β-catenin at Ser45, and is independent of Axin function. We also show that a phosphorylated PPPSPXS peptide is able to activate Wnt/β-catenin signaling and to induce axis duplication in Xenopus embryos, presumably by inhibition of GSK3 in vivo. Based on these observations, we propose a working model that Axin recruitment to the phosphorylated LRP6 places GSK3 in the vicinity of multiple phosphorylated PPPSPXS motifs, which directly inhibit GSK3 phosphorylation of β-catenin. This model provides a possible mechanism to account, in part, for inhibition of β-catenin phosphorylation by Wnt-activated LRP6."
https://openalex.org/W2053856289,"The genetic make-up of the host has a major influence on its response to combat pathogens. For influenza A virus, several single gene mutations have been described which contribute to survival, the immune response and clearance of the pathogen by the host organism. Here, we have studied the influence of the genetic background to influenza A H1N1 (PR8) and H7N7 (SC35M) viruses. The seven inbred laboratory strains of mice analyzed exhibited different weight loss kinetics and survival rates after infection with PR8. Two strains in particular, DBA/2J and A/J, showed very high susceptibility to viral infections compared to all other strains. The LD(50) to the influenza virus PR8 in DBA/2J mice was more than 1000-fold lower than in C57BL/6J mice. High susceptibility in DBA/2J mice was also observed after infection with influenza strain SC35M. In addition, infected DBA/2J mice showed a higher viral load in their lungs, elevated expression of cytokines and chemokines, and a more severe and extended lung pathology compared to infected C57BL/6J mice. These findings indicate a major contribution of the genetic background of the host to influenza A virus infections. The overall response in highly susceptible DBA/2J mice resembled the pathology described for infections with the highly virulent influenza H1N1-1918 and newly emerged H5N1 viruses."

https://openalex.org/W2045527675,"In the seminiferous epithelium, Eps8 is localized to actin-based cell junctions at the blood-testis barrier (BTB) and the apical ectoplasmic specialization (ES) in stage V-VI tubules but is considerably diminished in stage VIII tubules. Eps8 down-regulation coincides with the time of BTB restructuring and apical ES disassembly, implicating the role of Eps8 in cell adhesion. Its involvement in Sertoli-germ cell adhesion was substantiated in studies using an in vivo animal model by treating rats with 1-(2,4-dichlorobenzy)-1H-indazole-3-carbohydrazide (adjudin) to induce anchoring junction restructuring, during which Eps8 disappeared at the apical ES before germ cell departure. In Sertoli cell cultures with established permeability barrier mimicking the BTB in vivo, the knockdown of Eps8 by RNAi led to F-actin disorganization and the mislocalization of the tight junction proteins occludin and ZO-1, suggesting the function of Eps8 in maintaining BTB integrity. In vivo knockdown of Eps8 in the testis caused germ cell sloughing and BTB damage, concomitant with occludin mislocalization, further validating that Eps8 is a novel regulator of cell adhesion and BTB integrity in the seminiferous epithelium."
https://openalex.org/W2064774245,"Parkinson disease (PD)-associated genomic deletions and the destabilizing L166P point mutation lead to loss of the cytoprotective DJ-1 protein. The effects of other PD-associated point mutations are less clear. Here we demonstrate that the M26I mutation reduces DJ-1 expression, particularly in a null background (knockout mouse embryonic fibroblasts). Thus, homozygous M26I mutation causes loss of DJ-1 protein. To determine the cellular consequences, we measured suppression of apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) and cytotoxicity for [M26I]DJ-1, and systematically all other DJ-1 methionine and cysteine mutants. C106A mutation of the central redox site specifically abolished binding to ASK1 and the cytoprotective activity of DJ-1. DJ-1 was apparently recruited into the ASK1 signalosome via Cys-106-linked mixed disulfides. The designed higher order oxidation mimicking [C106DD]DJ-1 non-covalently bound to ASK1 even in the absence of hydrogen peroxide and conferred partial cytoprotection. Interestingly, mutations of peripheral redox sites (C46A and C53A) and M26I also led to constitutive ASK1 binding. Cytoprotective [wt]DJ-1 bound to the ASK1 N terminus (which is known to bind another negative regulator, thioredoxin 1), whereas [M26I]DJ-1 bound to aberrant C-terminal site(s). Consequently, the peripheral cysteine mutants retained cytoprotective activity, whereas the PD-associated mutant [M26I]DJ-1 failed to suppress ASK1 activity and nuclear export of the death domain-associated protein Daxx and did not promote cytoprotection. Thus, cytoprotective binding of DJ-1 to ASK1 depends on the central redox-sensitive Cys-106 and may be modulated by peripheral cysteine residues. We suggest that impairments in oxidative conformation changes of DJ-1 might contribute to PD neurodegeneration."

https://openalex.org/W2079076888,"Loss of genome-wide methylation is a common feature of cancer, and the degree of hypomethylation has been correlated with genomic instability. Global methylation of repetitive elements possibly arose as a defense mechanism against parasitic DNA elements, including retrotransposons and viral pathogens. Given the alterations of global methylation in both viral infection and cancer, we examined genome-wide methylation levels in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), a cancer causally associated with human papilloma virus (HPV). We assayed global hypomethylation levels in 26 HNSCC samples, compared with their matched normal adjacent tissue, using Pyrosequencing-based methylation assays for LINE repeats. In addition, we examined cell lines derived from a variety of solid tumors for LINE and SINE (Alu) repeats. The degree of LINE and Alu hypomethylation varied among different cancer cell lines. There was only moderate correlation between LINE and Alu methylation levels, with the range of variation in methylation levels being greater for the LINE elements. LINE hypomethylation was more pronounced in HPV-negative than in HPV-positive tumors. Moreover, genomic instability, as measured by genome-wide loss-of-heterozygosity (LOH) single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis, was greater in HNSCC samples with more pronounced LINE hypomethylation. Global hypomethylation was variable in HNSCC. Its correlation with both HPV status and degree of LOH as a surrogate for genomic instability may reflect alternative oncogenic pathways in HPV-positive versus HPV-negative tumors."
https://openalex.org/W1995550632,"In Alzheimer's disease (AD), early deficits in learning and memory are a consequence of synaptic modification induced by toxic beta-amyloid oligomers (oAbeta). To identify immediate molecular targets downstream of oAbeta binding, we prepared synaptoneurosomes from prefrontal cortex of control and incipient AD (IAD) patients, and isolated mRNAs for comparison of gene expression. This novel approach concentrates synaptic mRNA, thereby increasing the ratio of synaptic to somal mRNA and allowing discrimination of expression changes in synaptically localized genes. In IAD patients, global measures of cognition declined with increasing levels of dimeric Abeta (dAbeta). These patients also showed increased expression of neuroplasticity related genes, many encoding 3'UTR consensus sequences that regulate translation in the synapse. An increase in mRNA encoding the GluR2 subunit of the alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid receptor (AMPAR) was paralleled by elevated expression of the corresponding protein in IAD. These results imply a functional impact on synaptic transmission as GluR2, if inserted, maintains the receptors in a low conductance state. Some overexpressed genes may induce early deficits in cognition and others compensatory mechanisms, providing targets for intervention to moderate the response to dAbeta."
https://openalex.org/W2129016742,"Studies have persistently shown deficiencies in medical reporting by the mainstream media. We have been monitoring the accuracy and comprehensiveness of medical news reporting in Australia since mid 2004. This analysis of more than 1200 stories in the Australian media compares different types of media outlets and examines reporting trends over time.Between March 2004 and June 2008 1230 news stories were rated on a national medical news monitoring web site, Media Doctor Australia. These covered a variety of health interventions ranging from drugs, diagnostic tests and surgery to dietary and complementary therapies. Each story was independently assessed by two reviewers using ten criteria. Scores were expressed as percentages of total assessable items deemed satisfactory according to a coding guide. Analysis of variance was used to compare mean scores and Fishers exact test to compare proportions. Trends over time were analysed using un-weighted linear regression analysis. Broadsheet newspapers had the highest average satisfactory scores: 58% (95% CI 56-60%), compared with tabloid newspapers and online news outlets, 48% (95% CI 44-52) and 48% (95% CI 46-50) respectively. The lowest scores were assigned to stories broadcast by human interest/current affairs television programmes (average score 33% (95% CI 28-38)). While there was a non- significant increase in average scores for all outlets, a significant improvement was seen in the online news media: a rise of 5.1% (95%CI 1.32, 8.97; P 0.009). Statistically significant improvements were seen in coverage of the potential harms of interventions, the availability of treatment or diagnostic options, and accurate quantification of benefits.Although the overall quality of medical reporting in the general media remains poor, this study showed modest improvements in some areas. However, the most striking finding was the continuing very poor coverage of health news by commercial current affairs television programs."
https://openalex.org/W1983400015,"Telomere maintenance is essential to ensure proper size and function of organs with a high turnover. In particular, a dwarf phenotype as well as phenotypes associated to premature loss of tissue regeneration, including the skin (hair loss, hair graying, decreased wound healing), are found in mice deficient for telomerase, the enzyme responsible for maintaining telomere length. Coincidental with the appearance of these phenotypes, p53 is found activated in several tissues from these mice, where is thought to trigger cellular senescence and/or apoptotic responses. Here, we show that p53 abrogation rescues both the small size phenotype and restitutes the functionality of epidermal stem cells (ESC) of telomerase-deficient mice with dysfunctional telomeres. In particular, p53 ablation restores hair growth, skin renewal and wound healing responses upon mitogenic induction, as well as rescues ESCmobilization defects in vivo and defective ESC clonogenic activity in vitro. This recovery of ESC functions is accompanied by a downregulation of senescence markers and an increased proliferation in the skin and kidney of telomerase-deficient mice with critically short telomeres without changes in apoptosis rates. Together, these findings indicate the existence of a p53-dependent senescence response acting on stem/progenitor cells with dysfunctional telomeres that is actively limiting their contribution to tissue regeneration, thereby impinging on tissue fitness."
https://openalex.org/W1986459945,"Social interactions are influenced by the perception of others as similar or dissimilar to the self. Such judgements could depend on physical and semantic characteristics, such as membership in an ethnic or political group. In the present study we tested whether social representations of the self and of others could affect the perception of touch. To this aim, we assessed tactile perception on the face when subjects observed a face being touched by fingers. In different conditions we manipulated the identity of the shown face. In a first experiment, Caucasian and Maghrebian participants viewed a face belonging either to their own or to a different ethnic group; in a second experiment, Liberal and Conservative politically active participants viewed faces of politicians belonging to their own or to the opposite political party. The results showed that viewing a touched face most strongly enhanced the perception of touch on the observer's face when the observed face belonged to his/her own ethnic or political group."
https://openalex.org/W2148016530,"Mutations in filamin A (FLNa), an essential cytoskeletal protein with multiple binding partners, cause developmental anomalies in humans.We determined the structure of the 23rd Ig repeat of FLNa (IgFLNa23) that interacts with FilGAP, a Rac-specific GTPase-activating protein and regulator of cell polarity and movement, and the effect of the three disease-related mutations on this interaction. A combination of NMR structural analysis and in silico modeling revealed the structural interface details between the C and D beta-strands of the IgFLNa23 and the C-terminal 32 residues of FilGAP. Mutagenesis of the predicted key interface residues confirmed the binding constraints between the two proteins. Specific loss-of-function FLNa constructs were generated and used to analyze the importance of the FLNa-FilGAP interaction in vivo. Point mutagenesis revealed that disruption of the FLNa-FilGAP interface perturbs cell spreading. FilGAP does not bind FLNa homologs FLNb or FLNc establishing the importance of this interaction to the human FLNa mutations. Tight complex formation requires dimerization of both partners and the correct alignment of the binding surfaces, which is promoted by a flexible hinge domain between repeats 23 and 24 of FLNa. FLNa mutations associated with human developmental anomalies disrupt the binding interaction and weaken the elasticity of FLNa/F-actin network under high mechanical stress.Mutational analysis informed by structure can generate reagents for probing specific cellular interactions of FLNa. Disease-related FLNa mutations have demonstrable effects on FLNa function."
https://openalex.org/W2044751374,"Background In 2005, a new primate species from Tanzania, the kipunji, was described and recognized as a member of the mangabey genus Lophocebus. However, molecular investigations based upon a number of papionins, including a limited sample of baboons of mainly unknown geographic origin, identified the kipunji as a sister taxon to Papio and not as a member of Lophocebus. Accordingly, the kipunji was separated into its own monotypic genus, Rungwecebus. Methodology/Principal Findings We compare available mitochondrial and nuclear sequence data from the voucher specimen of Rungwecebus to other papionin lineages, including a set of geographically proximal (parapatric) baboon samples. Based on mitochondrial sequence data the kipunji clusters with baboon lineages that lie nearest to it geographically, i.e. populations of yellow and chacma baboons from south-eastern Africa, and thus does not represent a sister taxon to Papio. Nuclear data support a Papio+Rungwecebus clade, but it remains questionable whether Rungwecebus represents a sister taxon to Papio, or whether it is nested within the genus as depicted by the mitochondrial phylogeny. Conclusions/Significance Our study clearly supports a close relationship between Rungwecebus and Papio and might indicate that the kipunji is congeneric with baboon species. However, due to its morphological and ecological uniqueness Rungwecebus more likely represents a sister lineage to Papio and experienced later introgressive hybridization. Presumably, male (proto-)kipunjis reproduced with sympatric female baboons. Subsequent backcrossing of the hybrids with kipunjis would have resulted in a population with a nuclear kipunji genome, but which retained the yellow/chacma baboon mitochondrial genome. Since only one kipunji specimen was studied, it remains unclear whether all members of the new genus have been impacted by intergeneric introgression or rather only some populations. Further studies with additional Rungwecebus samples are necessary to elucidate the complete evolutionary history of this newly-described primate genus."
https://openalex.org/W2085581523,"The G protein-coupled lysophosphatidic acid 2 (LPA(2)) receptor elicits prosurvival responses to prevent and rescue cells from apoptosis. However, G protein-coupled signals are not sufficient for the full protective effect of LPA(2). LPA(2) differs from other LPA receptor subtypes in the C-terminal tail, where it contains a zinc finger-binding motif for the interactions with LIM domain-containing TRIP6 and proapoptotic Siva-1, and a PDZ-binding motif through which it complexes with the NHERF2 scaffold protein. In this report, we identify a unique CXXC motif of LPA(2) responsible for the binding to TRIP6 and Siva-1, and demonstrate that disruption of these macromolecular complexes or knockdown of TRIP6 or NHERF2 expression attenuates LPA(2)-mediated protection from chemotherapeutic agent-induced apoptosis. In contrast, knockdown of Siva-1 expression enhances this effect. Furthermore, a PDZ-mediated direct interaction between TRIP6 and NHERF2 facilitates their interaction with LPA(2). Together, these results suggest that in addition to G protein-activated signals, the cooperation embedded in the LPA(2)-TRIP6-NHERF2 ternary complex provides a novel ligand-dependent signal amplification mechanism that is required for LPA(2)-mediated full activation of antiapoptotic signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2090940318,"It was well accepted that only B-lymphocytes and plasma cells expressed immunoglobulin (Ig) gene. However, our group and others have confirmed that non-B-cells, such as epithelial cancer cells, can also express Ig. The aim of this work is to elucidate the role of non-B-cell-derived Ig by investigating the characteristics of the Ig heavy chain (IgH) gene repertoire in epithelial cancer cells. We cloned and sequenced 89 V(H)DJ(H) (V-D-J recombination of the IgH variable region) transcripts by microdissecting cells from eight different types of epithelial cancers and two cancer cell lines (HT-29 and HeLa S3). The cancer-derived Ig gene repertoire showed specific restricted patterns of V(H)DJ(H) recombination with seven sets of predominant V(H)DJ(H) sequences. Surprisingly, within a set of V(H)DJ(H) recombination, the variable (V) sequences derived from different cancer types had not only identical heavy chain variable (VH), diversity (D), and joining (JH) segments usage, but also identical junctions and mutation targets in the V(H) region. The V(Hgamma)DJ(Hgamma) (but not V(Hmicro)DJ(Hmicro)) in the cancer-derived sequences had a high mutation rate; however, it was shown that the mechanism of hypermutation was different from antigen selection in B-cell-derived V(Hgamma)DJ(Hgamma)sequences. In contrast to V(Hmicro)DJ(Hmicro), the V(Hgamma)DJ(Hgamma) sequences did not appear to originate from classical class switching. These results suggest that cancer-derived Ig genes have a distinct repertoire that may have implications for their role in carcinogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2045325107,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is characterized by chronic airway inflammation. Cigarette smoke has been considered a major player in the pathogenesis of COPD. The inflamed airways of COPD patients contain several inflammatory cells including neutrophils, macrophages,T lymphocytes, and dendritic cells (DCs). The relative contributions of these various inflammatory cells to airway injury and remodeling are not well documented. In particular, the potential role of DCs as mediators of inflammation in the smoker's airways and COPD patients is poorly understood. In the current study we analyzed the effects of cigarette smoke extract on mouse bone marrow derived DC and the production of chemokines and cytokines were studied. In addition, we assessed CSE-induced changes in cDC function in the mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR) examining CD4+ and CD8+ T cell proliferation. Cigarette smoke extract induces the release of the chemokines CCL3 and CXCL2 (but not cytokines), via the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). In a mixed-leukocyte reaction assay, cigarette smoke-primed DCs potentiate CD8(+)T cell proliferation via CCL3. In contrast, proliferation of CD4(+)T cells is suppressed via an unknown mechanism. The cigarette smoke-induced release of CCL3 and CXCL2 by DCs may contribute to the influx of CD8(+)T cells and neutrophils into the airways, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W1992389562,"In cells lacking the histone methyltransferase Set2, initiation of RNA polymerase II transcription occurs inappropriately within the protein-coding regions of genes, rather than being restricted to the proximal promoter. It was previously reported that this ""cryptic"" transcription occurs preferentially in long genes, and in genes that are infrequently transcribed. Here, we mapped the transcripts produced in an S. cerevisiae strain lacking Set2, and applied rigorous statistical methods to identify sites of cryptic transcription at high resolution. We find that suppression of cryptic transcription occurs independent of gene length or transcriptional frequency. Our conclusions differ with those reported previously because we obtained a higher-resolution dataset, we accounted for the fact that gene length and transcriptional frequency are not independent variables, and we accounted for several ascertainment biases that make cryptic transcription easier to detect in long, infrequently transcribed genes. These new results and conclusions have implications for many commonly used genomic analysis approaches, and for the evolution of high-fidelity RNA polymerase II transcriptional initiation in eukaryotes."
https://openalex.org/W2042091383,"Melanoma cells express the chemokine receptor CXCR4 that confers high invasiveness upon binding to its ligand CXCL12. Melanoma cells at initial stages of the disease show reduction or loss of E-cadherin expression, but recovery of its expression is frequently found at advanced phases. We overexpressed E-cadherin in the highly invasive BRO lung metastatic cell melanoma cell line to investigate whether it could influence CXCL12-promoted cell invasion. Overexpression of E-cadherin led to defective invasion of melanoma cells across Matrigel and type I collagen in response to CXCL12. A decrease in individual cell migration directionality toward the chemokine and reduced adhesion accounted for the impaired invasion. A p190RhoGAP-dependent inhibition of RhoA activation was responsible for the impairment in chemokine-stimulated E-cadherin melanoma transfectant invasion. Furthermore, we show that p190RhoGAP and p120ctn associated predominantly on the plasma membrane of cells overexpressing E-cadherin, and that E-cadherin-bound p120ctn contributed to RhoA inactivation by favoring p190RhoGAP-RhoA association. These results suggest that melanoma cells at advanced stages of the disease could have reduced metastatic potency in response to chemotactic stimuli compared with cells lacking E-cadherin, and the results indicate that p190RhoGAP is a central molecule controlling melanoma cell invasion."
https://openalex.org/W2021574737,"Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) is a bioactive sphingolipid implicated in diverse cellular functions including survival, proliferation, tumorigenesis, inflammation, and immunity. Sphingosine kinase (SphK) contributes to these functions by converting sphingosine to S1P. We report here that the nonstructural protein NS3 from bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV), a close relative of hepatitis C virus (HCV), binds to and inhibits the catalytic activity of SphK1 independently of its serine protease activity, whereas HCV NS3 does not affect SphK1 activity. Uncleaved NS2-3 from BVDV was also found to interact with and inhibit SphK1. We suspect that inhibition of SphK1 activity by BVDV NS3 and NS2-3 may benefit viral replication, because SphK1 inhibition by small interfering RNA, chemical inhibitor, or overexpression of catalytically inactive SphK1 results in enhanced viral replication, although the mechanisms by which SphK1 inhibition leads to enhanced viral replication remain unknown. A role of SphK1 inhibition in viral cytopathogenesis is also suggested as overexpression of SphK1 significantly attenuates the induction of apoptosis in cells infected with cytopathogenic BVDV. These findings suggest that SphK is targeted by this virus to regulate its catalytic activity.

Uncleaved NS2-3 from BVDV was also found to interact with and inhibit SphK1. We suspect that inhibition of SphK1 activity by BVDV NS3 and NS2-3 may benefit viral replication, because SphK1 inhibition by small interfering RNA, chemical inhibitor, or overexpression of catalytically inactive SphK1 results in enhanced viral replication, although the mechanisms by which SphK1 inhibition leads to enhanced viral replication remain unknown. A role of SphK1 inhibition in viral cytopathogenesis is also suggested as overexpression of SphK1 significantly attenuates the induction of apoptosis in cells infected with cytopathogenic BVDV. These findings suggest that SphK is targeted by this virus to regulate its catalytic activity.

BVDV establishes persistent infections in cattle populations worldwide. Because BVDV shares virological and molecular properties with the Flaviviridae family member hepatitis C virus (HCV), which chronically infects an estimated 200 million patients worldwide (1Shepard C.W. Finelli L. Alter M.J. Lancet Infect. Dis. 2005; 5: 558-567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2226) Google Scholar), BVDV is regarded as a surrogate model for HCV (2Buckwold V.E. Beer B.E. Donis R.O. Antiviral Res. 2003; 60: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Both HCV and BVDV encode a single large precursor polyprotein that is processed by cellular and viral proteases into mature structural and nonstructural (NS) proteins.BVDV NS3 exhibits serine protease and helicase/ATPase activities that require its cofactor NS4A (3Xu J. Mendez E. Caron P.R. Lin C. Murcko M.A. Collett M.S. Rice C.M. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 5312-5322Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). NS3/4A protease is essential for generating mature NS proteins that are required for viral replication. HCV NS3/4A is well characterized and has been shown to suppress type-I interferons by cleaving the cellular interferon mediators IPS-1 and TRIF (4Li K. Foy E. Ferreon J.C. Nakamura M. Ferreon A.C. Ikeda M. Ray S.C. Gale Jr., M. Lemon S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 2992-2997Crossref PubMed Scopus (912) Google Scholar, 5Li X.D. Sun L. Seth R.B. Pineda G. Chen Z.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 17717-17722Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar). However, neither interferon suppression nor cellular targets have been identified for the BVDV NS3/4A protease (6Chen Z. Benureau Y. Rijnbrand R. Yi J. Wang T. Warter L. Lanford R.E. Weinman S.A. Lemon S.M. Martin A. Li K. J. Virol. 2007; 81: 964-976Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar).Lytic and persistent BVDV infections depend on the virus biotype. Cytopathogenic (CP) BVDV causes cytopathic effects via apoptosis, whereas noncytopathogenic (NCP) BVDV does not induce obvious changes in cell morphology and viability. These features are distinguished by NS2-3 processing differences; free NS3 produced by NS2-3 cleavage is generated continuously following CP BVDV infections, whereas NS3 is detected only until ∼9 h postinfection (p.i.) for NCP BVDV due to down-regulation of NS2-3 cleavage by this biotype (7Lackner T. Muller A. Pankraz A. Becher P. Thiel H.J. Gorbalenya A.E. Tautz N. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 10765-10775Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The CP biotype is characterized by dramatic up-regulation of viral RNA synthesis that could be correlated with the induction of cytopathic effect (7Lackner T. Muller A. Pankraz A. Becher P. Thiel H.J. Gorbalenya A.E. Tautz N. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 10765-10775Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 8Vassilev V.B. Donis R.O. Virus Res. 2000; 69: 95-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 9Yamane D. Kato K. Tohya Y. Akashi H. J. Gen. Virol. 2006; 87: 2961-2970Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Because free NS3, but not NS2-3, can form an active viral replicase complex with other NS proteins, increased viral RNA synthesis promoted through the release of free NS3 has been suggested to be a determinant of the characteristic lytic phenotype of CP BVDV infections (10Lackner T. Muller A. Konig M. Thiel H.J. Tautz N. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 9746-9755Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). However, little is known about the regulation of cellular signaling by BVDV NS2-3, NS3, and NS3/4A, which is crucial for the control of both viral replication and biotype.Recent studies on the mechanisms of viral replication revealed that HCV RNA synthesis occurs on a lipid raft membrane structure where the active viral replicase complex is found (11Aizaki H. Lee K.J. Sung V.M. Ishiko H. Lai M.M. Virology. 2004; 324: 450-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 12Gao L. Aizaki H. He J.W. Lai M.M. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 3480-3488Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). The significance of the lipid raft as a scaffold for viral replication is further demonstrated by the identification of a novel HCV replication inhibitor, NA255, which prevents the biosynthesis of sphingolipids, the major components of lipid rafts (13Sakamoto H. Okamoto K. Aoki M. Kato H. Katsume A. Ohta A. Tsukuda T. Shimma N. Aoki Y. Arisawa M. Kohara M. Sudoh M. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2005; 1: 333-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Administration of NA255 results in disruption of the HCV replicase complexes from the lipid rafts. This report proposes that the interaction between HCV NS5B and sphingomyelin on lipid rafts plays a crucial role for HCV RNA replication. Cellular sphingolipid metabolism is regulated by a large number of converting enzymes that maintain a homeostasis (14Spiegel S. Milstien S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 397-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (1733) Google Scholar) but viral mechanisms that affect the sphingolipid metabolism to facilitate viral replication have yet to be identified.In a search for potential host proteins that interact with BVDV NS3, we identified sphingosine kinase 1 (SphK1) as a binding partner of NS3 using the yeast two-hybrid system. SphK1 is a lipid kinase that catalyzes the phosphorylation of sphingosine to form sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), a bioactive sphingolipid implicated in diverse cellular functions, including proliferation, survival, tumorigenesis, development, inflammation, and immunity (14Spiegel S. Milstien S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 397-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (1733) Google Scholar, 15Shida D. Takabe K. Kapitonov D. Milstien S. Spiegel S. Curr. Drug Targets. 2008; 9: 662-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Here, we analyze the biological significance of the SphK1 interaction with NS3, NS2-3, and NS3/4A. Using purified recombinant SphK1 and NS3, SphK activity was inhibited by NS3 in a dose-dependent manner, independently of its serine protease activity. The inhibition appears to be specific for BVDV NS3 because HCV NS3 had no effect on SphK activity. Using specific chemical inhibitors, small interfering RNA (siRNA), and a catalytically inactive mutant of SphK1, we investigated the significance of SphK inhibition in the viral replication. The present study is the first report demonstrating that SphK1 is targeted by a virus to inhibit its catalytic activity, and this mechanism may contribute to the efficient replication and pathogenesis of BVDV.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESReagents and Antibodies—d-erythro-Sphingosine and sphingosine kinase inhibitor (SKI) (16French K.J. Schrecengost R.S. Lee B.D. Zhuang Y. Smith S.N. Eberly J.L. Yun J.K. Smith C.D. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 5962-5969PubMed Google Scholar) were purchased from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). S1P was obtained from Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI). Anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (mAb; IgG1), anti-Myc mAb (IgG1), and isotype control IgG1 mAb were from Sigma. Anti-BVDV NS3 (IgG2a) and anti-GAPDH mAbs were from TropBio (Townsville, Australia) and Ambion (Austin, TX), respectively. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies (pAbs) against calnexin and SphK1 were from Stressgen (Victoria, Canada) and Exalpha (Maynard, MA), respectively. Mouse pAb against junctional adhesion molecule 1 was described previously (17Makino A. Shimojima M. Miyazawa T. Kato K. Tohya Y. Akashi H. J. Virol. 2006; 80: 4482-4490Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Goat anti-mouse IgG, IgG1, IgG2a, or anti-rabbit IgG antibodies conjugated with Alexa 488, Alexa 488, Alexa 594, or Alexa 568, respectively, were from Invitrogen. Rabbit pAb against HCV NS3 was kindly provided by Dr. Michinori Kohara (Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Medical Science, Tokyo, Japan). Protein concentrations in samples were determined with the Protein Quantification Kit-Rapid (Dojindo, Rockville, MD) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Molybdenum blue spray was from Sigma. Recombinant human SphK1 (hSphK1) was purchased from BPS Bioscience (San Diego, CA).Cells and Viruses—MDBK, LB9.K, and human embryonic kidney HEK293 cell lines were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 5, 10, and 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), respectively, at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. MDBK and LB9.K cells were confirmed to be free of BVDV by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). BVDV strains KS86-1cp, KS86-1ncp, and Nose have been described previously (18Nagai M. Sakoda Y. Mori M. Hayashi M. Kida H. Akashi H. J. Gen. Virol. 2003; 84: 447-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Unless otherwise indicated, MDBK and LB9.K cells were infected with BVDV using a multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of 5 for 1 h, washed twice with FCS-free DMEM, and incubated in DMEM containing 5 or 10% FCS, respectively. End point viral titration was performed with four replicates on MDBK cells and the 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID50) determined as described previously (7Lackner T. Muller A. Pankraz A. Becher P. Thiel H.J. Gorbalenya A.E. Tautz N. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 10765-10775Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The intracellular synthesis of virus-specific proteins at 72 h p.i. was detected by indirect immunofluorescence analysis using anti-BVDV NS3 mAb (TropBio) and a secondary fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled antibody as described below under “Immunofluorescence Microscopy.”RNA Extraction—Total RNA was extracted using the SV Total RNA Isolation System (Promega, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's protocol.Plasmids—The bovine SphK1 complementary DNA (cDNA; GenBank™ data base accession number XM_870939.1) was generated from total RNA extracted from MDBK cells by RT-PCR using primers that incorporated EcoRI and EcoRV sites at the 5′ and 3′ ends, respectively. Mammalian expression vector of N-terminal FLAG-tagged bovine SphK1, designated pFlag-SphK1, was generated by cloning the SphK1 cDNA into pFLAG-CMV2 (Sigma) using EcoRI and EcoRV sites. The fragments encoding a series of deletion mutants of SphK1 were generated by PCR-mediated site mutagenesis using pFlag-SphK1 as a template. The fragment of catalytically inactive SphK1G177D was generated by PCR-mediated mutagenesis using pFlag-SphK1 as a template with the mutagenic primer 5′-TCGTGGATCAGCCCATCATCGGACATGACCACCAG-3′ to substitute Gly177 to Asp.The mammalian expression vectors of BVDV NS proteins were generated using SRα promoter vector, pME18S. The Myc tag sequence together with the multiple cloning site from pGBKT7 was amplified by PCR using pGBKT7-NS3 as a template and cloned between XhoI and PstI sites of pME18S vector. A DNA fragment encoding BVDV NS3, NS2-3, NS3/4A, and NS5A was generated from the BVDV Nose strain (genotype 1a; GenBank data base accession number AB078951) by SuperScript III One-Step RT-PCR System with Platinum Taq High Fidelity (Invitrogen) using primers that incorporated NdeI and PstI sites at the 5′ and 3′ ends, respectively. The fragments were then cloned into pME18S-Myc using NdeI and PstI sites to generate pME-NS3, pME-NS2-3, pME-NS3/4A, and pME-NS5A. A series of N-terminal deletion mutants of NS3 was generated by PCR-mediated site mutagenesis using pME-NS3 as a template. The fragment of serine protease-negative NS3/4AS2051A was generated by PCR-mediated mutagenesis using pME-NS3/4A as a template with the mutagenic primer 5′-AATATAGGCAGGCCCGCCCATCCCTTCAAGTT-3′ to substitute Ser2051 to Ala. Hybrid cytomegalovirus enhancer/chicken β-actin (CAG) promoter-driven pME18S vectors, termed pCAG, encoding BVDV NS proteins were constructed by a replacement of the SRα promoter with the CAG promoter fragment from the pCAGGS vector using SspI and XhoI sites of pME18S vectors. pEF-HCV NS3/4A, which contains the HCV NS3/4A cDNA of the HCV HCR6 strain (genotype 1b; GenBank data base accession number AY045702) cloned into pEF-1 vector (Invitrogen), was kindly provided by Dr. Michinori Kohara. All constructs were confirmed by sequencing with an ABI PRISM 3150 genetic analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Tokyo, Japan).Yeast Two-hybrid Screening—Potential interacting partners of NS3 were sought using the yeast two-hybrid system according to the manufacturer's manual for the MATCHMAKER Library Construction and Screening Kit (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). The N-terminal domain of NS3 (amino acids 1889 to 2032) derived from the BVDV Nose strain was amplified by RT-PCR using primers that incorporated NdeI and EcoRI sites at the 5′ and 3′ ends, respectively, and cloned into NdeI and EcoRI sites of pGBKT7 in-frame with the Gal4 DNA-binding domain to express N-terminal Myc-tagged partial NS3, designated pGBKT7-NS3. For the construction of the MDBK cDNA library, first strand cDNA was synthesized using random primers from 0.6 μg of mRNA, which was purified from total RNA using the oligotex-dT30<Super> mRNA Purification Kit (TaKaRa, Shiga, Japan), and double-stranded cDNA amplified by 22 cycles long distance (LD) PCR as described in manufacturer's protocol. Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain AH109 was transformed with the bait plasmid pGBKT7-NS3, and selected in synthetic medium lacking tryptophan. A positive clone harboring pGBKT7-NS3 was confirmed to express N-terminal 142 amino acids of the NS3 protein with anti-Myc mAb by Western blot analysis (data not shown). The MDBK cell double-stranded cDNA library together with SmaI-linearized pGADT7-Rec (Clontech) was cotransformed in an AH109 clone harboring pGBKT7-NS3 to clone cDNA into the GAL4 AD expression vector pGADT7-Rec by homologous recombination. The transformed yeast cells were grown on agar plates of synthetic medium lacking histidine, leucine, and tryptophan containing 20 μg/ml 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-α-O-galactopyranoside (X-α-gal). A total of 145 clones were identified from 1 × 106 colonies screened in the library. The insert DNA fragments of isolated clones were amplified by PCR using LD-Insert Screening Amplimer Sets (Clontech) according to the manufacturer's protocol, and then determined by sequencing.Transfection and Immunoprecipitation—LB9.K cells were transiently transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) as described in the manufacturer's protocol. Transfection efficiency of LB9.K cells was typically 80–90%. LB9.K cells were seeded onto 6-well tissue culture plates 24 h before transfection. Cells were then transfected with 4 μg of plasmids per well. At 24 h post-transfection, cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and scraped into 0.2 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 20 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm Na3VO4) supplemented with Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics). The lysates equalized with the same amount of proteins were immunoprecipitated with 3 μg of anti-FLAG, anti-Myc, anti-BVDV NS3, or control mouse IgG1 mAbs for 2 h at 4 °C, respectively. The immune complexes were precipitated by incubation with protein G-Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare) for another 1 h. The agarose beads were washed four times with 1 ml of wash buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 20 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm Na3VO4). The immunoprecipitates were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad), probed with antibodies, and immunocomplexes detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL). Antibodies used were: horseradish peroxidase-conjugated mAbs against FLAG (1:1000 dilution; Sigma) and Myc (1:1000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and a rabbit pAb against NS3 (1:3000). Images were taken by LAS-4000mini image analyzer system (Fujifilm, Tokyo, Japan).Subcellular Fractionation—Cells were harvested into lysis buffer lacking Triton X-100, sonicated, and centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 10 min. Subcellular fractionation was performed by sequential centrifugation as described previously (19Maceyka M. Sankala H. Hait N.C. Le Stunff H. Liu H. Toman R. Collier C. Zhang M. Satin L.S. Merrill Jr., A.H. Milstien S. Spiegel S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 37118-37129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). In brief, postnuclear supernatants were centrifuged at 17,000 × g for 15 min to obtain the inner membrane fraction. The resulting supernatants were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h to obtain cytosolic and pelleted plasma membrane fractions. The pellet containing inner or plasma membrane was resuspended in lysis buffer (volume comparable with supernatant) and sonicated.Sphingosine Kinase Assay—Sphingosine kinase activity was determined as described previously (20Olivera A. Kohama T. Tu Z. Milstien S. Spiegel S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12576-12583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). The labeled S1P was separated by TLC on Silica Gel G-60 (Whatman) with 1-butanol/ethanol/acetic acid/water (80:20:10:20, v/v) and visualized by autoradiography. The radioactive spots corresponding to S1P were scraped and counted in a scintillation counter.Generation of Recombinant Bovine Sphingosine Kinase 1— pFlag-SphK1 was transfected into HEK293 cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) to express the Flag-SphK1, which was subsequently purified by binding to FLAG(M2)-Sepharose (Sigma), followed by elution with the FLAG peptide (0.2 mg/ml). The eluted Flag-SphK1 was concentrated using an Ultrafree-0.5 Centrifugal Filter Device (50,000 Da cutoff; Millipore, Billerica, MA) and diluted in the sphingosine kinase buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 20% glycerol, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm EDTA, 15 mm sodium fluoride, 20 mm Na3VO4, and 0.5 mm 4-deoxypyridoxine) supplemented with a Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics). This procedure was repeated five times to reduce the concentration of the FLAG peptide.Generation of Glutathione S-Transferase (GST) Fusion Proteins—NS3, NS3/4A, and NS5A sequences of BVDV Nose strain were amplified by PCR using plasmid pME-NS3/4A or pME-NS5A as a template. The PCR product of NS3, NS3/4A, or NS5A was cloned into bacterial expression vector pGEX5X-2 using SmaI and NotI sites (NS3 and NS3/4A) or EcoRI and NotI sites (NS5A). HCV NS3 and NS3/4A sequences were amplified by PCR using plasmid pEF-HCV NS3/4A as a template. The PCR products were then cloned into pGEX5X-1 using EcoRI and XhoI sites. BVDV and HCV NS proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 as GST fusion proteins at the N terminus. Overnight cultures were grown with shaking at 37 °C in Luria-Bertani broth containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin and 20 μg/ml chloramphenicol. The culture was then diluted into fresh Luria-Bertani broth containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin and 20 μg/ml chloramphenicol, and grown with shaking at 37 °C to an A600 of 0.6–1.0. Expression of the GST fusion proteins was then induced with 1.2 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, and the cultures were incubated with shaking at 37 °C for a further 3 h. The bacterial cells were then harvested by centrifugation at 6,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, resuspended in 10 ml of GST-soluble buffer (40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100), and lysed by sonication. The lysates were mixed well and centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The resultant clarified bacterial lysate was then incubated with GSH-Sepharose 4B for 2 h at 4 °C with constant mixing. Subsequently, the GSH-Sepharose beads (with bound protein) were pelleted by centrifugation at 3,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C and washed five times in GST-soluble buffer. These beads were then either used directly in a pull-down assay, or the GST fusion proteins were eluted by incubation with cold PBS containing 10 mm GSH for 30 min with constant mixing. This elution procedure was repeated three times. Eluted proteins were concentrated by using Ultrafree-0.5 Centrifugal Filter Device (10,000 Da cutoff; Millipore).Immunofluorescence Microscopy—LB9.K cells were seeded on an eight-well chamber slide (Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark) at 2 × 104 per well 24 h before transfection. Nontransfected cells or the cells transfected with Flag-SphK1 were inoculated with BVDV as described in the figure legends. At 18 h p.i., cells were washed twice with PBS, fixed with PBS containing 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with PBS containing 0.5% Triton X-100, and blocked with PBS containing 10% bovine serum albumin for 10 min. Nontransfected cells were then incubated with anti-calnexin pAb and mouse anti-BVDV NS3 mAb for 1 h followed by incubation with Alexa 568-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG and Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. Transfected cells were double-stained with mouse anti-FLAG mAb (IgG1) and mouse anti-BVDV NS3 mAb (IgG2a) followed by Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG1 and Alexa 594-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG2a antibodies, or with mouse anti-FLAG mAb and anti-calnexin pAb followed by Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG and Alexa 568-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibodies. Cells incubated with secondary antibodies were then washed three times with PBS, mounted in Dako fluorescent mounting medium (Dako Corporation, Carpinteria, CA), then sealed and observed under an LSM 510 microscope (Carl Zeiss, Tokyo, Japan).Measurement of S1P Synthesis—LB9.K cells transiently transfected with pCAG vectors encoding BVDV NS proteins or MDBK cells infected with BVDV were incubated for 4 h in phosphate-free DMEM (Invitrogen), then labeled with fresh phosphate-free DMEM containing [32P]orthophosphate (0.2 mCi/ml) and incubated for 4 h at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. Cells were then scraped on ice into 400 μl of methanol, 1 m NaCl, 5 m NaOH (100:100:3, v/v), then 200 μl of chloroform added. Samples were vortexed thoroughly and centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 5 min. The upper aqueous phase containing S1P was transferred to a new tube, and acidified through addition of 20 μl of 1 m HCl and 400 μl of chloroform/methanol/HCl (100/200/1, v/v). Samples were vortexed thoroughly and phases separated by addition of 120 μl of chloroform and 120 μl of 2 m KCl. After centrifugation, the lower organic phase was dried under vacuum and resuspended in chloroform, and resolved by TLC as described above. The radioactive spots corresponding to S1P were scraped from the plates and counted in a scintillation counter.RNA Interference—Duplex siRNAs were purchased from Invitrogen. The siRNA sequence targeting SphK1 was 5′-GCAGUGGCCGCUUCUUUGAACUAUU-3′ (sense) and 5′-AAUAGUUCAAAGAAGCGGCCACUGC-3′ (antisense), corresponding to 634–658 relative to the first nucleotide of the start codon. The sequence used for scrambled control siRNA was 5′-GCAGGCCCGUUUCUUAGCAUUGAUU-3′ (sense) and 5′-AAUCAAUGCUAAGAAACGGGCCUGC-3′ (antisense). LB9.K cells were transfected with 20 nm siRNA using siLentfect (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's protocol.Quantitative Real-time RT-PCR—cDNA synthesis was performed with the PrimeScript RT Reagent Kit (TaKaRa) according to the manufacturer's protocol. GAPDH mRNA and viral RNA were quantified using Power SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) as previously described (21Yamane D. Kato K. Tohya Y. Akashi H. Vet. Microbiol. 2008; 129: 69-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar).Apoptosis Assay—The DEVDase activity assay was performed as described previously (22Yamane D. Nagai M. Ogawa Y. Tohya Y. Akashi H. Microbes. Infect. 2005; 7: 1482-1491Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) using Ac-DEVD-AMC as a substrate.RESULTSIdentification of SphK1 as a Binding Partner of BVDV NS3 and NS2-3— To identify potential cellular binding partners of BVDV NS3, we conducted a yeast two-hybrid screen using the N-terminal 142 amino acids of NS3 as bait, and isolated a cDNA clone encoding partial SphK1 from 1 of 145 total positive colonies. The cDNA sequence encoded 164 C-terminal amino acids of SphK1 (Fig. 1A). Employing the cDNA sequence for bovine SphK1 from the GenBank data base, specific primers were designed and used to clone a bovine SphK1 by RT-PCR cloning using total RNA isolated from MDBK cells. Subsequently, a catalytically inactive form of bovine SphK1 was constructed by substituting aspartic acid (D) for glycine (G) at position 177 in the ATP-binding site of the diacylglycerol catalytic domain, according to the previous study (23Pitson S.M. Moretti P.A. Zebol J.R. Xia P. Gamble J.R. Vadas M.A. D'Andrea R.J. Wattenberg B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33945-33950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). This SphK1G177D was used for further functional studies. To investigate whether the cloned bovine SphK1 encodes a bona fide SphK, LB9.K cells were transiently transfected with expression vectors containing FLAG-tagged SphK1. Similar to the previous study (24Olivera A. Kohama T. Edsall L. Nava V. Cuvillier O. Poulton S. Spiegel S. J.

By comparison, expression of catalytically inactive SphK1G177D produced no detectable increase in SphK activity. Western blot analysis using anti-FLAG antibody revealed a specific protein band with an apparent molecular mass consistent with the predicted size (∼55 kDa) of FLAG-tagged SphK1, which was absent in vector-transfected cells (Fig. 1C).To confirm the interaction between NS3 and SphK1, we cotransfected Flag-SphK1 and Myc-NS3 in LB9.K cells, immunoprecipitated NS3 using an anti-Myc mAb, and determined whether SphK1 was coprecipitated with NS3 by Western blotting. We also cotransfected an empty vector or NS5A as a negative control and uncleaved NS2-3. Both NS3 and NS2-3, but neither NS5A nor vector control, coprecipitated with SphK1 (Fig. 1D). We attempted to express Myc-tagged NS2 in the same way as above to demonstrate that NS2 does not mediate the binding of NS2-3 to SphK1, but failed to express detectable levels of NS2 protein, most likely due to its instability in LB9.K c"
https://openalex.org/W1983526504,"The RhoGTPase Cdc42 coordinates cell morphogenesis, cell cycle, and cell polarity decisions downstream of membrane-bound receptors through distinct effector pathways. Cdc42-effector protein interactions represent important elements of cell signaling pathways that regulate cell biology in systems as diverse as yeast and humans. To derive mechanistic insights into cell signaling pathways, it is vital that we generate quantitative data from in vivo systems. We need to be able to measure parameters such as protein concentrations, rates of diffusion, and dissociation constants (K(D)) of protein-protein interactions in vivo. Here we show how single wavelength fluorescence cross-correlation spectroscopy in combination with Förster resonance energy transfer analysis can be used to determine K(D) of Cdc42-effector interactions in live mammalian cells. Constructs encoding green fluorescent protein or monomeric red fluorescent protein fusion proteins of Cdc42, an effector domain (CRIB), and two effectors, neural Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (N-WASP) and insulin receptor substrate protein (IRSp53), were expressed as pairs in Chinese hamster ovary cells, and concentrations of free protein as well as complexed protein were determined. The measured K(D) for Cdc42V12-N-WASP, Cdc42V12-CRIB, and Cdc42V12-IRSp53 was 27, 250, and 391 nm, respectively. The determination of K(D) for Cdc42-effector interactions opens the way to describe cell signaling pathways quantitatively in vivo in mammalian cells."
https://openalex.org/W2031175131,"Background Sustained outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 in avian species increase the risk of reassortment and adaptation to humans. The ability to contain its spread in chickens would reduce this threat and help maintain the capacity for egg-based vaccine production. While vaccines offer the potential to control avian disease, a major concern of current vaccines is their potency and inability to protect against evolving avian influenza viruses. Methodology / Principal Findings The ability of DNA vaccines encoding hemagglutinin (HA) proteins from different HPAI H5N1 serotypes was evaluated for its ability to elicit neutralizing antibodies and to protect against homologous and heterologous HPAI H5N1 strain challenge in mice and chickens after DNA immunization by needle and syringe or with a pressure injection device. These vaccines elicited antibodies that neutralized multiple strains of HPAI H5N1 when given in combinations containing up to 10 HAs. The response was dose-dependent, and breadth was determined by the choice of the influenza virus HA in the vaccine. Monovalent and trivalent HA vaccines were tested first in mice and conferred protection against lethal H5N1 A/Vietnam/1203/2004 challenge 68 weeks after vaccination. In chickens, protection was observed against heterologous strains of HPAI H5N1 after vaccination with a trivalent H5 serotype DNA vaccine with doses as low as 5 µg DNA given twice either by intramuscular needle injection or with a needle-free device. Conclusions/Significance DNA vaccines offer a generic approach to influenza virus immunization applicable to multiple animal species. In addition, the ability to substitute plasmids encoding different strains enables rapid adaptation of the vaccine to newly evolving field isolates."
https://openalex.org/W1972787224,"Recent studies have suggested distinctive biological properties and signaling mechanisms between human and mouse embryonic stem cells (hESCs and mESCs). Herein we report that Shp2, a protein tyrosine phosphatase with two SH2 domains, has a conserved role in orchestration of intracellular signaling cascades resulting in initiation of differentiation in both hESCs and mESCs. Homozygous deletion of Shp2 in mESCs inhibited differentiation into all three germ layers, and siRNA-mediated knockdown of Shp2 expression in hESCs led to a similar phenotype of impaired differentiation. A small molecule inhibitor of Shp2 enzyme suppressed both hESC and mESC differentiation capacity. Shp2 modulates Erk, Stat3 and Smad pathways in ES cells and, in particular, Shp2 regulates BMP4-Smad pathway bi-directionally in mESCs and hESCs. These results reveal a common signaling mechanism shared by human and mouse ESCs via Shp2 modulation of overlapping and divergent pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2023876937,"Background Cachexia is among the most debilitating and life-threatening aspects of cancer. It represents a metabolic syndrome affecting essential functional circuits involved in the regulation of homeostasis, and includes anorexia, fat and muscle tissue wasting. The anorexigenic peptide α-MSH is believed to be crucially involved in the normal and pathologic regulation of food intake. It was speculated that blockade of its central physiological target, the melanocortin (MC)-4 receptor, might provide a promising anti-cachexia treatment strategy. This idea is supported by the fact that in animal studies, agouti-related protein (AgRP), the endogenous inverse agonist at the MC-4 receptor, was found to affect two hallmark features of cachexia, i.e. to increase food intake and to reduce energy expenditure. Methodology/Principal Findings SNT207707 and SNT209858 are two recently discovered, non peptidic, chemically unrelated, orally active MC-4 receptor antagonists penetrating the blood brain barrier. Both compounds were found to distinctly increase food intake in healthy mice. Moreover, in mice subcutaneously implanted with C26 adenocarcinoma cells, repeated oral administration (starting the day after tumor implantation) of each of the two compounds almost completely prevented tumor induced weight loss, and diminished loss of lean body mass and fat mass. Conclusions/Significance In contrast to the previously reported peptidic and small molecule MC-4 antagonists, the compounds described here work by the oral administration route. Orally active compounds might offer a considerable advantage for the treatment of cachexia patients."
https://openalex.org/W2071169595,"Deregulation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases (PI3K)/Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway plays a central role in tumor formation and progression, providing validated targets for cancer therapy. S9, a hybrid of alpha-methylene-gamma-lactone and 2-phenyl indole compound, possessed potent activity against this pathway.Effects of S9 on PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway were determined by Western blot, immunofluorescence staining and in vitro kinas assay. The interactions between tubulin and S9 were investigated by polymerization assay, CD, and SPR assay. The potential binding modes between S9 and PI3K, mTOR or tubulin were analyzed by molecular modeling. Anti-tumor activity of S9 was evaluated in tumor cells and in nude mice bearing human cancer xenografts. S9 abrogated EGF-activated PI3K-Akt-mTOR signaling cascade and Akt translocation to cellular membrane in human tumor cells. S9 possessed inhibitory activity against both PI3K and mTOR with little effect on other tested 30 kinases. S9 also completely impeded hyper-phosphorylation of Akt as a feedback of inhibition of mTOR by rapamycin. S9 unexpectedly arrested cells in M phase other than G1 phase, which was distinct from compounds targeting PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway. Further study revealed that S9 inhibited tubulin polymerization via binding to colchicine-binding site of tubulin and resulted in microtubule disturbance. Molecular modeling indicated that S9 could potentially bind to the kinase domains of PI3K p110alpha subunit and mTOR, and shared similar hydrophobic interactions with colchicines in the complex with tubulin. Moreover, S9 induced rapid apoptosis in tumor cell, which might reflect a synergistic cooperation between blockade of both PI3-Akt-mTOR signaling and tubulin cytoskeleton. Finally, S9 displayed potent antiproliferative activity in a panel of tumor cells originated from different tissue types including drug-resistant cells and in nude mice bearing human tumor xenografts.Taken together, S9 targets both PI3K-Akt-mTOR signaling and microtubule cytoskeleton, which combinatorially contributes its antitumor activity and provides new clues for anticancer drug design and development."
https://openalex.org/W2017802485,"Professional soccer players have a lengthy playing season, throughout which high levels of physical stress are maintained. The following recuperation period, before starting the next pre-season training phase, is generally considered short but sufficient to allow a decrease in these stress levels and therefore a reduction in the propensity for injury or musculoskeletal tissue damage. We hypothesised that these physical extremes influence the body composition, blood flow, and endothelial/immune function, but that the recuperation may be insufficient to allow a reduction of tissue stress damage. Ten professional football players were examined at the end of the playing season, at the end of the season intermission, and after the next pre-season endurance training. Peripheral blood flow and body composition were assessed using venous occlusion plethysmography and DEXA scanning respectively. In addition, selected inflammatory and immune parameters were analysed from blood samples. Following the recuperation period a significant decrease of lean body mass from 74.4+/-4.2 kg to 72.2+/-3.9 kg was observed, but an increase of fat mass from 10.3+/-5.6 kg to 11.1+/-5.4 kg, almost completely reversed the changes seen in the pre-season training phase. Remarkably, both resting and post-ischemic blood flow (7.3+/-3.4 and 26.0+/-6.3 ml/100 ml/min) respectively, were strongly reduced during the playing and training stress phases, but both parameters increased to normal levels (9.0+/-2.7 and 33.9+/-7.6 ml/100 ml/min) during the season intermission. Recovery was also characterized by rising levels of serum creatinine, granulocytes count, total IL-8, serum nitrate, ferritin, and bilirubin. These data suggest a compensated hypo-perfusion of muscle during the playing season, followed by an intramuscular ischemia/reperfusion syndrome during the recovery phase that is associated with muscle protein turnover and inflammatory endothelial reaction, as demonstrated by iNOS and HO-1 activation, as well as IL-8 release. The data provided from this study suggest that the immune system is not able to function fully during periods of high physical stress. The implications of this study are that recuperation should be carefully monitored in athletes who undergo intensive training over extended periods, but that these parameters may also prove useful for determining an individual's risk of tissue stress and possibly their susceptibility to progressive tissue damage or injury."
https://openalex.org/W2079686515,"Background The pathogenesis of enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) O157∶H7 infection is attributed to virulence factors encoded on multiple pathogenicity islands. Previous studies have shown that EHEC O157∶H7 modulates host cell signal transduction cascades, independent of toxins and rearrangement of the cytoskeleton. However, the virulence factors and mechanisms responsible for EHEC-mediated subversion of signal transduction remain to be determined. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to first identify differentially regulated genes in response to EHEC O157∶H7 grown in the presence of epithelial cells, compared to growth in the absence of epithelial cells (that is, growth in minimal essential tissue culture medium alone, minimal essential tissue culture medium in the presence of 5% CO2, and Penassay broth alone) and, second, to identify EHEC virulence factors responsible for pathogen modulation of host cell signal transduction. Methodology/Principal Findings Overnight cultures of EHEC O157∶H7 were incubated for 6 hr at 37°C in the presence or absence of confluent epithelial (HEp-2) cells. Total RNA was then extracted and used for microarray analyses (Affymetrix E. coli Genome 2.0 gene chips). Relative to bacteria grown in each of the other conditions, EHEC O157∶H7 cultured in the presence of cultured epithelial cells displayed a distinct gene-expression profile. A 2.0-fold increase in the expression of 71 genes and a 2.0-fold decrease in expression of 60 other genes were identified in EHEC O157∶H7 grown in the presence of epithelial cells, compared to bacteria grown in media alone. Conclusion/Significance Microarray analyses and gene deletion identified a protease on O-island 50, gene Z1787, as a potential virulence factor responsible for mediating EHEC inhibition of the interferon (IFN)-γ-Jak1,2-STAT-1 signal transduction cascade. Up-regulated genes provide novel targets for use in developing strategies to interrupt the infectious process."
https://openalex.org/W2087514908,"Intermedilysin (ILY) is an unusual member of the family of cholesterol-dependent cytolysins because it binds to human CD59 (hCD59) rather than directly to cholesterol-rich membranes. Binding of ILY to hCD59 initiates a series of conformational changes within the toxin that result in the conversion of the soluble monomer into an oligomeric membrane-embedded pore complex. In this study the association of ILY with its membrane receptor has been examined throughout the assembly and formation of the pore complex. Using ILY mutants trapped at various stages of pore assembly, we show ILY remains engaged with hCD59 throughout the assembly of the prepore oligomer, but it disengages from the receptor upon the conversion to the pore complex. We further show that the assembly intermediates increase the sensitivity of the host cell to lysis by its complement membrane attack complex, apparently by blocking the hCD59-binding site for complement proteins C8alpha and C9."
https://openalex.org/W2058214009,"Background The tectorial membrane (TM) in the mammalian cochlea displays anisotropy, where mechanical or structural properties differ along varying directions. The anisotropy arises from the presence of collagen fibrils organized in fibers of ∼1 µm diameter that run radially across the TM. Mechanical coupling between the TM and the sensory epithelia is required for normal hearing. However, the lack of a suitable technique to measure mechanical anisotropy at the microscale level has hindered understanding of the TM's precise role. Methodology/Principal Findings Here we report values of the three elastic moduli that characterize the anisotropic mechanical properties of the TM. Our novel technique combined Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), modeling, and optical tracking of microspheres to determine the elastic moduli. We found that the TM's large mechanical anisotropy results in a marked transmission of deformations along the direction that maximizes sensory cell excitation, whereas in the perpendicular direction the transmission is greatly reduced. Conclusions/Significance Computational results, based on our values of elastic moduli, suggest that the TM facilitates the directional cooperativity of sensory cells in the cochlea, and that mechanical properties of the TM are tuned to guarantee that the magnitude of sound-induced tip-link stretching remains similar along the length of the cochlea. Furthermore, we anticipate our assay to be a starting point for other studies of biological tissues that require directional functionality."
https://openalex.org/W2007996939,"Background Bacillus species are spore-forming bacteria that are ubiquitous in the environment and display a range of virulent and avirulent phenotypes. This range is particularly evident in the Bacillus cereus sensu lato group; where closely related strains cause anthrax, food-borne illnesses, and pneumonia, but can also be non-pathogenic. Although much of this phenotypic range can be attributed to the presence or absence of a few key virulence factors, there are other virulence-associated loci that are conserved throughout the B. cereus group, and we hypothesized that these genes may be regulated differently in pathogenic and non-pathogenic strains. Methodology/Principal Findings Here we report transcriptional profiles of three closely related but phenotypically unique members of the Bacillus cereus group—a pneumonia-causing B. cereus strain (G9241), an attenuated strain of B. anthracis (Sterne 34F2), and an avirulent B. cereus strain (10987)—during exponential growth in two distinct atmospheric environments: 14% CO2/bicarbonate and ambient air. We show that the disease-causing Bacillus strains undergo more distinctive transcriptional changes between the two environments, and that the expression of plasmid-encoded virulence genes was increased exclusively in the CO2 environment. We observed a core of conserved metabolic genes that were differentially expressed in all three strains in both conditions. Additionally, the expression profiles of putative virulence genes in G9241 suggest that this strain, unlike Bacillus anthracis, may regulate gene expression with both PlcR and AtxA transcriptional regulators, each acting in a different environment. Conclusions/Significance We have shown that homologous and even identical genes within the genomes of three closely related members of the B. cereus sensu lato group are in some instances regulated very differently, and that these differences can have important implications for virulence. This study provides insights into the evolution of the B. cereus group, and highlights the importance of looking beyond differences in gene content in comparative genomics studies."
https://openalex.org/W2081093939,"Background Despite increasing recognition of the importance of human rights in the protection and promotion of health, formal human rights education has been lacking in schools of medicine and public health. Our objectives were: 1) to determine the nature and extent of health and human rights (HHR) education among schools of medicine (SOMs) and public health (SPHs); 2) to identify perceived barriers to implementing HHR curricula; 3) to learn about deans' interests and attitudes toward HHR education, and; 4) to identify factors associated with offering HHR education. Methods and Principal Findings We conducted a cross-sectional survey among deans of all accredited allopathic SOMs and SPHs in the United States and Puerto Rico. Seventy-one percent of U.S. SOMs and SPHs responded. Thirty-seven percent of respondents indicated that their schools offered some form of HHR education. Main barriers to offering HHR education included competition for time, lack of qualified instructors and lack of funding. Among schools not offering HHR education, 35% of deans were interested in offering HHR education. Seventy-six percent of all deans believed that it was very important or important to offer HHR education. Multiple regression analysis revealed that deans' attitudes were the most important factor associated with offering any HHR education. Conclusion Findings indicate that though a majority of deans of SOMs and SPHs believe that knowledge about human rights is important in health practice and support the inclusion of HHR studies in their schools, HHR education is lacking at most of their institutions. These results and the growing recognition of the critical interdependence between health and human rights indicate a need for SOMs and SPHs to work towards formal inclusion of HHR studies in their curricula, and that HHR competency requirements be considered to overcome barriers to its inclusion."
https://openalex.org/W1966918658,"Background Adults play an important role in regulating the social behaviour of young individuals. However, a few pioneer studies suggest that, more than the mere presence of adults, their proportions in social groups affect the social development of young. Here, we hypothesized that aggression rates and social cohesion were correlated to adult-young ratios. Our biological model was naturally-formed groups of Przewalski horses, Equus f. przewalskii, varying in composition. Methodology/Principal Findings We investigated the social interactions and spatial relationships of 12 one- and two-year-old Przewalski horses belonging to five families with adult-young ratios (AYR) ranging from 0.67 to 1.33. We found striking variations of aggression rates and spatial relationships related to the adult-young ratio: the lower this ratio, the more the young were aggressive, the more young and adults segregated and the tighter the young bonded to other young. Conclusion/Significance This is the first study demonstrating a correlation between adult-young ratios and aggression rates and social cohesion of young individuals in a naturalistic setting. The increase of aggression and the emergence of social segregation in groups with lower proportions of adults could reflect a related decrease of the influence of adults as regulators of the behaviour of young. This social regulation has both theoretical and practical implications for understanding the modalities of the influence of adults during ontogeny and for recommending optimal settings, as for instance, for schooling or animal group management."
https://openalex.org/W1983855720,"The proteins of the Bcl-2 family are important regulators of apoptosis, or programmed cell death. These proteins regulate this fundamental biological process via the formation of heterodimers involving both pro- and anti-apoptotic family members. Disruption of the balance between anti- and pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins is the cause of numerous pathologies. Bcl-xl, an anti-apoptotic protein of this family, is known to form heterodimers with multiple pro-apoptotic proteins, such as Bad, Bim, Bak, and Bid. To elucidate the molecular basis of this recognition process, we used molecular dynamics simulations coupled with the Molecular Mechanics/Poisson-Boltzmann Surface Area approach to identify the amino acids that make significant energetic contributions to the binding free energy of four complexes formed between Bcl-xl and pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 homology 3 peptides. A fifth protein-peptide complex composed of another anti-apoptotic protein, Bcl-w, in complex with the peptide from Bim was also studied. The results identified amino acids of both the anti-apoptotic proteins as well as the Bcl-2 homology 3 (BH3) domains of the pro-apoptotic proteins that make strong, recurrent interactions in the protein complexes. The calculations show that the two anti-apoptotic proteins, Bcl-xl and Bcl-w, share a similar recognition mechanism.

The protein family is made up of two classes, one that contains those proteins that suppress cell death and the other that contains those proteins that promote cell death.

Particularly prominent is the BH3 domain, which has been identified as a mediator of cell death and has led to the identification of a family of proteins that contain only this domain (see Table 1). Referred to as BH3-only proteins (BOP), these proteins are believed to be part of a regulatory network serving to integrate cell survival and death signals. The importance of BH3 domains as mediators of cell death was identified in studies aimed at determining the molecular requirements for the interaction of the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member Bak with the cell death suppressor Bcl-xl (3Reed J.C. Am. J. Pathol. 2000; 157: 1415-1430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It was found that only the BH3 domain of Bak was required for its physiological activity and, in particular, for its interaction with Bcl-xl. Subsequent sequence analysis identified homologous domains in other pro-apoptotic proteins such as Bax, Bad, and Bik. Other members of the BOP family include the proteins Bid, Bim, Bik, Bmf, Puma Noxa, and Hrk (4Huang D.C. Strasser A.

Acta. 2004; 1644: 229-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). Given that the BH3-only proteins are key modulators of survival and death signals, these proteins are important targets in the development of therapeutics for the treatment of diseases where cell-death regulation breaks down, such as cancer, certain neurodegenerative diseases, and heart disease. One goal of therapeutic design is to develop compounds that activate a BOP-like response and trigger cell death by overcoming inappropriate death suppressor function in these cells. This approach was shown to be valid by the preclinical and clinical studies of antisense strategies toward Bcl-2 anti-apoptotic proteins (6Tanabe K. Kim R. Inoue H. Emi M. Uchida Y. Toge T. Int. J.

Modified BH3 peptides seem to have more suitable pharmacological potential. In fact, BH3 peptides constrained to an α-helical conformation (9Walensky L.D. Kung A.L. Escher I. Malia T.J. Barbuto S.

Several studies have shown that small molecules that bind to the hydrophobic groove of anti-apoptotic proteins are able to induce or restore apoptosis and have the potential to be used as anticancer drugs. In one study, Oltersdorf et al. (13Oltersdorf T. Elmore S.W. Shoemaker A.R. Armstrong R.C. Augeri D.J. Belli B.A. Bruncko M. Deckwerth T.L. Dinges J. Hajduk P.J. Joseph M.K. Kitada S. Korsmeyer S.J.

Recently, it has been demonstrated that small molecules antagonizing the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins are able to overcome the drug resistance that results from the overexpression of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins (14Doshi J.M. Tian D. Xing C. J. Med. Chem. 2006; 49: 7731-7739Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The overexpression of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins is believed to be a general mechanism for the development of chemotherapy resistance. It is recognized that anti-apoptotic proteins, such as Bcl-xl, have a significant number of binding partners. To better understand the mechanism of regulation, it is important to establish the principles that govern this recognition process. A concept that has emerged over the past number of years is that of the interaction energy hot spot (15Wells J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 202: 390-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 16Clackson T. Wells J.A. Science. 1995; 267: 383-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (1778) Google Scholar). The idea is that only a handful of amino acids at the binding interface make the dominant contribution to the binding affinity. Indeed, mutation studies, mostly alanine scanning studies, have shown that only a few mutations affect the free energy of binding by more than 2 kcal·mol−1 (17Bogan A.A. Thorn K.S. J. Mol.

Computational methods have been developed to identify interaction energy hot spots, thus providing detailed insight into the energetics of protein complex formation (18Honig B. Nicholls A.

Complementary to experiments, these physically based models permit the determination of structural and energetic consequences of mutations, as well as yielding insight into the intermolecular interactions that drive binding. Here we applied the MM/PBSA method to investigate the factors that give rise to promiscuous binding by the Bcl-xl anti-apoptotic protein. We used a protocol presented earlier (24Lafont V. Schaefer M. Stote R.H. Altschuh D. Dejaegere A. Proteins. 2007; 67: 418-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) to decompose the free energy of binding into individual amino acid contributions to map out the interactions that have a dominant role in the formation of these complexes, i.e. between anti-apoptotic proteins (Bcl-xl and Bcl-w) and BH3 peptides derived from the pro-apoptotic proteins Bid (27Denisov A.Y.

We identified consensus interactions that were present in all the complexes studied, suggesting that these interactions are at the basis of the promiscuous recognition process observed in the anti-apoptotic proteins, such as Bcl-xl. Some differences were observed between the different peptides that may have consequences for specificity. Knowledge of these energetic hot spot interactions is of general interest for the development of small molecule mimics of the BH3-only peptide. In this study, we use a protocol based on the MM/PBSA method (22Gohlke H. Kiel C. Case D.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 30: 891-913Crossref Scopus (953) Google Scholar, 24Lafont V. Schaefer M. Stote R.H.

Proteins. 1998; 32: 399-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) where conformations extracted from molecular dynamics simulations are processed using a simplified description for the solvent to yield an estimate of binding free energy. Individual contributions of each amino acid to the complex formation are estimated, and important energetic amino acid “hot spots” are identified. The coordinates of five Bcl-xl/BH3 peptide complexes were obtained from the Protein Data Bank (33Berman H.M. Westbrook J. Feng Z. Gilliland G. Bhat T.N. Weissig H. Shindyalov I.N. Bourne P.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (26989) Google Scholar). These include the following two structures of Bcl-xl in complex with BH3 peptides from the BOP protein Bad (PDB codes 1G5J (28Petros A.M. Nettesheim D.G. Wang Y. Olejniczak E.T. Meadows R.P. Mack J. Swift K. Matayoshi E.D. Zhang H. Thompson C.B. Fesik S.W.

Liang H. Nettesheim D. Meadows R.P. Harlan J.E. Eberstadt M. Yoon H.S. Shuker S.B. Chang B.S. Minn A.J. Thompson C.B. Fesik S.W.

Kappler J.W. Immunity. 2003; 19: 341-352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). The structures 2BZW and 1PQ1 are of mouse Bcl-xl in complex with the BH3 peptides from mouse Bad and Bid, respectively, rather than the human analogs. Given the high sequence homology with the human isoforms, these structures were used to develop homology models of the human complex, see below. The fifth structure studied was of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-w in interaction with the BH3 peptide from Bim (PDB code 1ZY3) (27Denisov A.Y. Chen G. Sprules T. Moldoveanu T. Beauparlant P. Gehring K. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 2250-2256Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Throughout this study, the different structures, and their respective simulations, will be referred to by their PDB identifiers, see Table 2 for details.TABLE 2Details of the experimental structuresPDB codeExperimental methodOrganismBcl-2 proteinBH3 peptide1G5JNMRHumanBcl-xlBad2BZWX-ray (2.3 Å)MouseBcl-xlBad1PQ1X-ray (1.65 Å)MouseBcl-xlBim1BXLNMRHumanBcl-xlBak1ZY3NMRHumanBcl-wBid Open table in a new tab The alignment of the Bcl-xl sequence of mouse and human shows an identity rate of 97%. The difference arises from five residues, none of which are located near the BH3 peptide binding groove. This high identity rate led us to construct a model of human Bcl-xl complexed to BH3 peptides Bim and Bad. However, the mouse structures were determined in the absence of the loop between the α-helix 1 and α-helix 2 (i.e. residues 29–81 for 2BZW and residues 28–78 for 1PQ1). Human homology models were built for the 2BZW and 1PQ1 complexes using 1G5J as a template structure and version 9.2 of MODELLER program (34Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10456) Google Scholar). Fifty models were generated and refined. The lowest energy model proposed by the MODELLER energy function was used as the starting structure for the MD simulations of these two complexes. The pKa values of titratable groups were determined for both isolated proteins and complexes using continuum electrostatics as described by Schaefer et al. (35Schaefer M. van Vlijmen H.W. Karplus M. Adv. Protein Chem. 1998; 51: 1-57Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Using the University of Houston Brownian Dynamics program (36Davis M.E. Madura J.D. Luty B.A. McCammon J.A. Comput. Phys. Commun. 1991; 62: 187-197Crossref Scopus (468) Google Scholar), the titration curves were obtained using a series of c-shell scripts provided by M. Schaefer. 4M. Schaefer, personal communication. The protonation states of selected residues were determined at a physiological pH of 7.4. The dielectric constant for the solvent was 80. Four values of the dielectric constant for the protein were tested (4, 8, 12, and 20), and all gave similar results. It was found that all amino acids were in their standard protonation state, and all His were neutral. Molecular dynamic simulations were done using the CHARMM program (37Brooks B.R. Bruccoleri R.E. Olafson B.D. States D.J. Swaminathan S. Karplus M. J. Comp. Chem. 1983; 4: 187-217Crossref Scopus (13881) Google Scholar) employing the all-atom parameter set of CHARMM22 (38MacKerell A.D.

Comput. Chem. 2004; 25: 1400-1415Crossref PubMed Scopus (2818) Google Scholar). Hydrogen atoms were added to the crystal structure using the HBUILD module (40Brunger A.T. Karplus M. Proteins. 1988; 4: 148-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar) after imposing the protonation states determined by the previously described pKa calculations. The terminal residues of the proteins were built in their charged state (NH3+ and COO−), whereas the BH3 peptide termini were neutralized using the acetyl group and N-methylamide for the N and C termini, respectively. The protein-peptide complexes were solvated in pre-equilibrated box of TIP3P water (41Jorgensen W.L. Chandrasekhar J. Madura J.D. Impey R.W. Klein M.L. J. Chem. Phys. 1983; 79: 926-935Crossref Scopus (29504) Google Scholar, 42Neria E. Fischer S. Karplus M. J. Chem. Phys. 1996; 105: 1902-1921Crossref Scopus (1093) Google Scholar). The size of the water box was chosen to have a minimal distance of 10 Å between the atoms of the complex and the extremities of the water box. Water molecules closer than 2.8 Å to any of the protein or peptide heavy atoms were deleted. Molecular dynamics simulations were performed at 300 K with periodic boundary conditions. Bond lengths involving bonds between heavy atoms and hydrogen atoms were constrained using the SHAKE algorithm (43Ryckaert J.P. Ciccotti G. Berendsen H.J.C. J. Comput. Phys. 1997; 23: 327-341Crossref Scopus (16734) Google Scholar). The nonbonded van der Waals interactions were truncated at a cutoff distance of 12.5 Å using a vshift function (44Steinbach P.J. Brooks B.R. J. Comp. Chem. 1994; 15: 667-683Crossref Scopus (890) Google Scholar). Electrostatic interactions were truncated at 14.0 Å using an fswitch function (44Steinbach P.J. Brooks B.R. J. Comp. Chem. 1994; 15: 667-683Crossref Scopus (890) Google Scholar). The minimization phase was divided into two steps. During the first step, the protein was fixed, and the water was energy-minimized by 100 steps of steepest descent algorithm followed by 400 steps using the adopted basis Newton Raphson algorithm. During the second step, the water was fixed, and the protein was minimized using both the same algorithms and same number of steps as above. The constraints were then removed, and the entire system was minimized with 500 and 3000 steps of steepest descent and adopted basis Newton Raphson, respectively. The system was gradually heated over 15 ps to reach 300 K. The system was equilibrated in two 20-ps stages. In the early equilibration, velocities were assigned every 50 steps according to a Gaussian distribution function, and in the late equilibration, the velocities were scaled by a single factor only when the average temperature was lying outside the 300 ± 10 K window. A time step of 2 fs was used, and the simulation time was 2 ns for each system. The purpose of the simulations was to generate multiple structures around the experimental structure to improve the statistical sampling of the MM/PBSA analysis. To obtain a semi-quantitative estimate of the contributions of all amino acids to the binding free energy for the formation of the Bcl-xl(w)-BH3 peptide complex, a molecular free energy decomposition scheme based on the MM/PBSA analysis was performed, following the approach presented by Lafont et al. (24Lafont V. Schaefer M. Stote R.H. Altschuh D. Dejaegere A. Proteins. 2007; 67: 418-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). From this analysis, an estimation of the free energy of binding for molecular complexes can be obtained. Briefly, in the MM/PBSA approach, the free energy is estimated using a standard thermodynamic cycle of the form shown in Scheme 1, where the binding free energy is calculated according to Equation 1, Prot+PeptideΔGgasassocProt:Peptide↓ΔGproteinsolv↓ΔGpeptidesolv↓ΔGcomplaxsolvProt+Peptide→SCHEME1Prot:Peptide(eq. 1) where ΔEMMgas is the difference in the gas phase energy; ΔSMM is the change in entropy upon complex formation, and ΔGsolvation is the change in solvation free energy. The gas phase energy differences contain terms for the intermolecular electrostatic and van der Waals energies, as well as the equivalent internal energy terms. These terms are based on the CHARMM force field in the present approach. The solvation free energy is divided into two contributions, an electrostatic and a nonpolar contribution. This latter term is approximated by an empirical relationship based on solvent-accessible surface area, and the electrostatic contribution is calculated here using the Poisson-Boltzmann equation. We verified, as a function of the relevant parameters, that the Poisson-Boltzmann equation, yielded convergent results. As discussed below, the change in entropy upon binding is neglected in the current model. A study by Zoete and Michielin (45Zoete V. Michielin O. Proteins. 2007; 67: 1026-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) showed that inclusion of entropy can improve agreement with experimental ΔG values but does not necessarily change the global energy profile. We analyzed the binding free energies in terms of individual energetic contributions. Decomposition of the binding free energy to individual amino acid contributions leads to the identification of amino acids that play a dominant role in binding and can contribute to reliable predictions of the role of particular amino acids in stabilizing complexes. Several approximations are introduced in the MM/PBSA method. The first was the neglect of conformational change upon complex formation, which is dictated by the absence of experimental structures for the unbound protein and peptides. To account for the unbound species in the calculations, their respective structures were obtained from the complex generated during the molecular dynamics simulations. With this approximation, there are no changes to the internal energy terms. The second approximation is the neglect of changes in configuration entropy because of binding. Although these simplifications preclude calculations of absolute values of the binding free energies, they have been shown in previous work to be satisfactory in the context of identifying interaction energy hot spots in protein-protein and protein-ligand complexes. Similar simplifications have been employed in other studies (19Hendsch Z.S. Tidor B. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 1381-1392Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 24Lafont V. Schaefer M. Stote R.H. Altschuh D. Dejaegere A. Proteins. 2007; 67: 418-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 46Gouda H. Kuntz I.D. Case D.A. Kollman P.A. Biopolymers. 2003; 68: 16-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Via this approach, the total binding free energy can be decomposed into individual energetic contributions per residue, yielding a more detailed energetic map of the binding interface. For the MM/PBSA analysis, the structures are extracted from the molecular dynamics simulations by the clustering method described below. The electrostatic component was calculated using the University of Houston Brownian Dynamics program (36Davis M.E. Madura J.D. Luty B.A. McCammon J.A. Comput. Phys. Commun. 1991; 62: 187-197Crossref Scopus (468) Google Scholar). The atomic charges and radii used for the protein were those of the CHARMM 22 force field (38MacKerell A.D. Bashford D. Bellott M. Dunbrack R.L. Evanseck J.D. Field M.J. Fischer S. Gao J. Guo H. Ha S. Joseph-McCarthy D. Kuchnir L. Kuczera K. Lau F.T.K. Mattos C. Michnick S. Ngo T. Nguyen D.T. Prodhom B. Reiher W.E. Roux B. Schlenkrich M. Smith J.C. Stote R. Straub J. Watanabe M. Wiorkiewicz-Kuczera J. Yin D. Karplus M. J. Phys. Chem. 1998; 102: 3586-3616Crossref PubMed Scopus (11621) Google Scholar). The total free energy and its individual components for each individual system were averaged and weighted based on the cluster populations, i.e. a higher weight was given to conformations extracted from more populated clusters (i.e. the weight of a conformation is proportional to the ratio of the number of conformations with that energy to the total number of conformations extracted from the MD trajectory). Equally, the standard deviation of each amino acid contribution was calculated taking into account the statistical weight of the conformation (47Spiegel M.R. Probability and Statistics. Schaum's Outline Series, McGraw-Hill Inc., New York1975Google Scholar). As described in Lafont et al. (24Lafont V. Schaefer M. Stote R.H. Altschuh D. Dejaegere A. Proteins. 2007; 67: 418-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), the different energy terms used in the MM/PBSA method fluctuate significantly with the small structural changes linked to thermal fluctuations. It is therefore necessary to use an ensemble of structures rather than one experimental structure in free energy decompositions based"

Proper compartmentalization of proteins relies on the ability of protein localization pathways to transport proteins efficiently from their sites of synthesis to their sites of function.

Mol. Membr. Biol. 2005; 22: 3-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The targeting function of SRP relies on a conserved 54-kDa SRP subunit (SRP54; Ffh in Escherichia coli and cpSRP54 in chloroplasts) as well as a conserved SRP receptor (SRα; FtsY in E. coli and cpFtsY in chloroplasts). For cytosolic SRPs (SRP54 and Ffh), interactions with a substrate signal sequence and an SRP RNA moiety are prerequisite for interaction with the SRP receptor (SRα and FtsY) (2Bradshaw N. Neher S.B. Booth D.S. Walter P. Science. 2009; 323: 127-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). GTP binding and hydrolysis by both SRP54 and SRα coordinate substrate release from SRP to the translocon and release of SRP from SRα. In chloroplasts, cpFtsY functions along with a unique SRP (cpSRP) to post-translationally target nuclear encoded proteins to thylakoid membranes (3Henry R. Goforth R.L. Schunemann D. Tamanoi F. Dalbey R. Koehler C. The Enzymes: Molecular Machines Involved in Protein Transport across Cellular Membranes 25. Elsevier, St. Louis, MO2007: 493-521Google Scholar). Light-harvesting chlorophyll a/b-binding proteins (LHCPs) imported into the chloroplast stroma are bound by cpSRP to form a soluble targeting complex, which directs the LHCP substrate to the thylakoid membrane translocon Alb3 (Albino3) in a GTP- and cpFtsY-dependent manner (14Moore M. Goforth R.L. Mori H. Henry R. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 1245-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 36Asakura Y. Hirohashi T. Kikuchi S. Belcher S. Osborne E. Yano S. Terashima I. Barkan A. Nakai M. Plant Cell. 2004; 16: 201-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Although many general steps of SRP protein targeting seem largely conserved across evolutionary boundaries, the nature and dynamics of the receptor appear to have diverged.In eukaryotic systems, SRα is peripherally bound to the membrane through association with the integral membrane subunit SRβ. In contrast, no chloroplast or bacterial homolog of SRβ has been identified. cpFtsY and E. coli FtsY (EcFtsY) are found partitioned between the membrane and the stroma or cytosol, respectively. The membrane-binding capacity of EcFtsY serves to stimulate GTPase activity and appears critical in that only membrane-associated EcFtsY supports the release of nascent chains from SRP to the translocon (4de Leeuw E. te Kaat K.

Von Heijne G. Lentzen G. Wintermeyer W. Oudega B. Luirink J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2504-2512Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). However, the partitioning activity is not strictly required because EcFtsY tethered to the membrane is functional in vivo (37Zelazny A. Seluanov A. Cooper A. Bibi E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6025-6029Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Given the conserved nature of partitioning among bacterial and chloroplast SRP receptors, partitioning may play an, as of yet, unidentified role in protein targeting by SRP. Nevertheless, differences in lipid composition between bacterial and thylakoid membranes make it interesting to speculate that there are mechanistic differences in membrane partitioning.Like many prokaryotic FtsY homologs (e.g. Thermus aquaticus), cpFtsY lacks the N-terminal acidic domain (A domain) implicated in EcFtsY membrane binding (6Samuelsson T. Zwieb C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 169-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Although the highly conserved FtsY GTPase domain (NG domain) of EcFtsY (EcFtsYNG) fails to support protein targeting, the addition of the last A domain residue, Phe-196 of a conserved double-Phe motif (EcFtsYNG+1), restores protein targeting in vivo (7Eitan A. Bibi E. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 2492-2494Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In vitro studies also show that EcFtsYNG+1 retains the capacity to bind membranes and support integration of SRP-dependent substrates, although at significantly reduced levels compared with full-length EcFtsY (8Angelini S.

A resolved structure of EcFtsYNG+1 suggests that the amphipathic nature of the region containing Phe-196 plays a critical role in membrane association (9Parlitz R. Eitan A. Stjepanovic G. Bahari L. Bange G. Bibi E. Sinning I. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 32176-32184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that liposomes stimulate GTP hydrolysis rates of SRP with EcFtsYNG+1, but not with EcFtsYNG, supporting the idea that the A domain in its entirety is not strictly required.For cpFtsY, the necessity and functional role(s) of partitioning between a thylakoid-bound and a soluble phase, as well as the role of N-terminal residues in these functions, remain unknown. In addition, both the conformational state of membrane-bound cpFtsY and EcFtsY and the mechanism responsible for controlling membrane partitioning and altered GTPase activity remain unclear. Because of the gain of function exhibited by EcFtsYNG+1 and the conserved nature of the surrounding motif (9Parlitz R. Eitan A. Stjepanovic G. Bahari L. Bange G. Bibi E. Sinning I. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 32176-32184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), it seems likely that this conserved region is necessary to support membrane binding and corresponding functions not only in EcFtsY but also in FtsY homologs.To examine the functional role of the N-terminal region of cpFtsY, we have utilized deletion and point mutants in assays that reconstitute cpFtsY activities, including the cpSRP-dependent integration of LHCP. Together, our data indicate that the conserved lipid-binding motif identified in bacterial FtsY homologs is present in cpFtsY and is both necessary and sufficient for thylakoid binding and critical for LHCP targeting.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAll reagents and enzymes used were purchased commercially. All primers were from Integrated DNA Technologies. The plasmid used for in vitro transcription/translation of pLHCP (psAB80XD/4) has been described (10Cline K. Fulsom D.R. Viitanen P.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14225-14232Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). cpSRP43, cpFtsY, and cpSRP54 were prepared as described (38Yuan J. Kight A. Goforth R.L. Moore M. Peterson E.C. Sakon J.

PCR amplification was used to create deletion and substitution mutants with incorporation of a Kozak sequence (Met-Ala) and restriction sites for insertion into pGEM-4Z. Expression clones were created by subcloning into pET-32b. The cpSRP43 transcription/translation clone was designed to match the mature coding sequence of A. thaliana cpSRP43 starting with Ala-Ala-Val-Gln-Arg-Asn and incorporating a Kozak sequence and restriction sites for insertion into pGEM-7Z. Chimeric sequence transcription/translation clones for Tha4TM-cpFtsY, Tha4TM-F48A, and Tha4TM-F48A/F49A are exact fusions constructed by overlap extension (11Horton R.M. Hunt H.D. Ho S.N. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (2628) Google Scholar) of Pisum sativum Tha4 beginning with Ala-Phe-Phe-Gly-Leu-Gly and ending with Val-Phe-Gly-Pro-Lys-Lys and A. thaliana cpFtsY beginning with Met-Ala-Cys-Ser-Ala-Gly-Pro-Ser. Likewise, cpFtsY39–56-cp43, EcFtsY186–204-cp43, and cpFtsY39–56-RubSS constructs are exact fusions of mature A. thaliana cpFtsY construct residues 39–56 (Met-Ala-Cys-Ser-Ala-Gly-Pro-Ser-Gly-Phe-Phe-Thr-Arg-Leu-Gly-Arg-Leu-Ile) or E. coli FtsY residues 186–204 (Glu-Gln-Glu-Lys-Pro-Thr-Lys-Glu-Gly-Phe-Phe-Ala-Arg-Leu-Lys-Arg-Ser-Leu-Leu), a linker (Val-Phe-Gly-Pro-Lys-Lys), and either the predicted mature sequence of A. thaliana cpSRP43 or the P. sativum RubSS beginning Gln-Val-Trp-Pro-Pro-Ile-Gly-Lys. The RubSS transcription/translation clone includes the linker described above and the predicted mature sequence of the P. sativum RubSS. Kozak sequences and restriction sites for insertion into pGEM-4Z were included in the primer for all above-mentioned transcription/translation clones. All cloned sequences were verified by DNA sequencing (Molecular Resource Laboratory, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences).Preparation of Chloroplasts and Radiolabeled Precursors—Intact chloroplasts were isolated from 10–12-day-old pea seedlings (P. sativum cv. Laxton's Progress) and used to prepare thylakoids and stroma as described (12Cline K. Henry R. Li C. Yuan J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4105-4114Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Chlorophyll content was determined as described previously (13Arnon D.I. Plant Physiol. 1949; 24: 1-15Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thylakoids were isolated from lysed chloroplasts by centrifugation and salt-washed two times with 1 m potassium acetate in import buffer (50 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 8.0) and 0.33 m sorbitol) and two times with import buffer with 10 mm MgCl2 (IBM buffer) prior to use. For protease treatment, salt-washed thylakoids were diluted to 0.5 mg/ml chlorophyll in import buffer with 0.2 mg/ml thermolysin and 1 mm CaCl2, incubated for 40–60 min, combined with EDTA in import buffer to 20 mm EDTA, and applied to a 7.5% (v/v) Percoll gradient in import buffer containing 10 mm EDTA. Pellets were washed once with import buffer containing 10 mm EDTA and twice with IBM buffer. Protease-treated thylakoids were resuspended at 1 mg/ml chlorophyll in IBM buffer.In vitro-transcribed capped RNA was translated in the presence of [35S]methionine using a wheat germ system to produce radiolabeled proteins (12Cline K. Henry R. Li C. Yuan J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4105-4114Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Constructs were labeled with ratios of labeled and unlabeled Met such that equal 35S signal represented equimolar protein. For example, to prepare equimolar amounts of two proteins with six and seven Met residues, respectively, the first construct would be prepared with 100% [35S]Met, whereas the second construct would be prepared with 86% [35S]Met and 14% unlabeled Met. Constructs were quantified by comparing the 35S signal from a given protein band as analyzed by SDS-PAGE and phosphorimaging. Equimolar amounts of proteins were added to each experiment (supplemental Fig. S2). Precursor LHCP translation products were diluted 2-fold with 30 mm unlabeled Met in import buffer prior to use.Protein Integration Assays Using Isolated Salt-washed Thylakoids—Integration assays included salt-washed thylakoids (equal to 50 μg of chlorophyll) in IBM buffer, 5 mm ATP, 1 mm GTP, 12.5 μl of radiolabeled pLHCP translation products, and stromal extract (equivalent to 50 μg of chlorophyll) or 25 μl of radiolabeled cpFtsY translation products and recombinant cpSRP43 and cpSRP54. Stromal extract, containing cpSRP and cpFtsY, was used as a positive control. Import buffer was used to bring the final volume to 150 μl. The mixtures were incubated at 25 °C for 30 min with light. Membranes were collected by centrifugation at 3200 × g for 6 min at 4 °C and protease-treated with thermolysin. Protease-treated membranes were solubilized in SDS buffer and heated. Amounts equivalent to 10 μg of chlorophyll/assay were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and phosphorimaging.Assays for Determining Membrane Binding and Partitioning—Partitioning assays included thylakoids (equal to 75 μg of chlorophyll) in IBM buffer and radiolabeled translation products. Reactions were incubated for 30 min in light at 25 °C. Thylakoids were centrifuged at 3200 × g for 6 min at 4 °C, washed in 1 ml of IBM buffer, and transferred to clean tubes. Thylakoids were then pelleted, solubilized in SDS buffer, and heated. Amounts equivalent to 7.5 μg of chlorophyll/sample were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and phosphorimaging.cpFtsY Membrane Binding Saturation Curves—Salt-washed or protease-treated thylakoids (equal to 50 μg of chlorophyll) were incubated with 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, or 64 μg of cpFtsY in a final volume of 100 μl of IBM buffer. Thylakoids were re-isolated, washed, and resuspended to a final volume of 50 μl, and 5 μl of each sample was analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Separated samples were transferred to BioTrace™ polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Pall Life Sciences) and incubated with rabbit anti-A. thaliana cpFtsY polyclonal antibodies (14Moore M. Goforth R.L. Mori H. Henry R. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 1245-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Horseradish peroxidase-labeled mouse IgG (SouthernBiotech) was used as a secondary antibody. Proteins reacting with antibodies were revealed by incubation with SuperSignal® West Pico chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce).Imaging Acquisition—SDS-polyacrylamide gels were imaged using a Typhoon 8600 (GE Healthcare) and analyzed with IQ Solutions software (Molecular Dynamics). Western blots were imaged using a FluorChem™ 8900 (Alpha Innotech) and analyzed with the corresponding AlphaEase® FC StandAlone software.Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC)—The binding of GMP-PNP/GDP to cpFtsY or F48A was analyzed by measuring heat change during titration of nucleotide into a protein solution using a VP-ITC titration microcalorimeter (MicroCal Inc.). All solutions were degassed under vacuum and equilibrated at 25 °C prior to titration. The sample cell (1.4 ml) contained 0.1 mm protein in 10 mm Tris buffer (pH 7.0) and 50 mm KCl. The reference cell contained MilliQ water. Upon equilibration, 5 mm GMP-PNP/GDP was injected in 20 × 6-μl aliquots using the default injection rate. Titration curves were corrected for protein-free buffer and analyzed using Origin ITC software (MicroCal Inc.).Liposome Preparation and Fluorescence Quenching Experiments—Soybean total extract (Avanti Polar Lipids) lipids were dissolved at 100 mg/ml in chloroform, dried under nitrogen, and vacuum-desiccated overnight. Lipid pellets were resuspended to 10 mg/ml (13 mm) in 10 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7), 100 mm KCl, and 1 mm EDTA. The lipid solution was subjected to 15-s sonication/15-s rest cycles for 2 min. Liposomes were clarified by centrifugation at 11,700 × g for 10 min at 4 °C and stored at 4 °C for up to 1 month. Liposomes were sized (Avanti mini-extruder) by passing through polycarbonate filters seven times. Brominated lipids were obtained by bromine addition to the unsaturated carbons of the soybean phosphatidylcholine fatty acyl chain as described (15Carney J. East J.M. Mall S. Marius P. Powl A.M. Wright J.N. Lee A.G. Curr. Protocols Protein Sci. 2006; PubMed Google Scholar). The brominated lipid mixture was extruded through 80-nm polycarbonate membranes and homogenized via freeze/thaw cycles.Fluorescence quenching was measured using a SpectraMax Gemini XS spectrofluorometer (Molecular Devices) set for maximum sensitivity and 282-nm excitation/330-nm emission wavelengths. 10 μg of protein in 50 μl of 10 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 8) and 10 mm MgCl2 and 0–50 μl of liposomes were mixed and equilibrated for 20 min at 25 °C, and the fluorescence was measured. For each concentration, six measurements of five separate samples were acquired. Fluorescence quenching was estimated as the normalized value of (F0 – F)/F0, where F0 is the average fluorescence of the samples without liposomes, and F is the average fluorescence for each concentration.GTPase Assays—GTPase activity assays were conducted at 22 °C and contained 100 nm cpFtsY or F48A, 0.5 μm [α-32P]GTP (400 Ci/mmol), and liposomes in a final volume of 5 μl of buffer (50 mm HEPES (pH 8.0), 150 mm potassium acetate, 10 mm potassium chloride, 2 mm magnesium acetate, 0.01% (v/v) C12E8 (octaethylene glycol mono-N-dodecyl ether), and 2 mm dithiothreitol). Aliquots were removed at frequent time points and spotted onto polyethyleneimine-cellulose thin layer plates as described (16Connolly T. Gilmore R. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 799-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar).NMR Structural Studies—All NMR spectra were acquired at 25 °C on a Bruker AVANCE DMX-500 MHz spectrometer equipped with a 5-mm triple resonance cryoprobe. NMR samples (∼1 mm concentration) were prepared both in 90% (v/v) H2O + 10% (v/v) D2O (pH 7.0) containing 100 mm NaCl and in Me2SO-d6. Two-dimensional 1H TOCSY and NOESY (17Wuthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., Hoboken, NJ1986Crossref Google Scholar) data were acquired with 2048 data points in the f2 dimension and 512 increments in the f1 dimension over a spectral width corresponding to 12 ppm. Two-dimensional 1H TOCSY data were acquired with mixing times of 60 and 75 ms. NOE-based distance restraints were derived from two-dimensional 1H NOESY data obtained with various mixing times (200, 250, 300, and 350 ms). All NMR spectra were processed using XWIN-NMR and Sparky software (18Goddard T.D. Kneller D.G. Sparky3. University of California, San Francisco1997Google Scholar). The backbone dihedral angle restraints derived from 3JNHαH coupling constants and the χ1 dihedral angles derived from the TOCSY data were used as additional constraints for the structure calculation (19Wang Y. Nip A.M. Wishart D.S. J. Biomol. NMR. 1997; 10: 373-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar).Distance restraints were derived from the NOESY spectrum of the peptides. NOE cross-peak intensities were measured and converted into distance. Structure calculation was performed using ARIA-CNS (Version 1.2) (20Linge J.P. O'Donoghue S.I. Nilges M. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 339: 71-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Several cycles of ARIA were performed using standard protocols by varying the chemical shift tolerance between 0.04 and 0.01 ppm. Assignments and violations were analyzed after each cycle. An ensemble of 12 structures was chosen (from a pool of 50 structures) on the basis of lowest energy terms associated with violation of experimentally derived constraints. The ensemble of the best overlapping structures (with least root mean square deviation) of peptides was viewed using MOLMOL (21Koradi R. Billeter M. Wuthrich K. J. Mol. Graphics. 1996; 14: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (6468) Google Scholar).Circular Dichroism—CD spectra were recorded on a Jasco J-715 spectropolarimeter using a sandwich quartz cell of 0.1-mm path length. Spectra were acquired at 0.1-nm intervals and at scan speeds of 10 nm/min. All measurements were made after incubation of peptides (50 μm final concentration) in appropriate concentrations of liposomes for 5 min at room temperature. The results are expressed as mean residue ellipticity ([θ]), defined as [θ] = θobs/nlc, where θobs is the observed ellipticity in degrees, n is the number of amino acids in the peptide, c is peptide concentration, and l is the light path (centimeters). Spectra were averaged over 10 scans and corrected for background absorption.Sequence Alignments—Sequence alignments of A. thaliana chloroplast, E. coli, Thermotoga maritima, and T. aquaticus FtsY homologs were performed using ClustalW (22Chenna R. Sugawara H. Koike T. Lopez R. Gibson T.J. Higgins D.G. Thompson J.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3497-3500Crossref PubMed Scopus (4013) Google Scholar). Sequences were input in FASTA format, and ClustalW was run using default settings. Alignment files were viewed using Jalview Version 2.0 (23Clamp M. Cuff J. Searle S.M. Barton G.J. Bioinformatics. 2004; 20: 426-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (1208) Google Scholar).Organeller cpFtsY sequences were obtained by searching for short, nearly exact matches using protein-protein BLAST (24Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59110) Google Scholar). Residues 41–366 of A. thaliana cpFtsY were blasted against Eukaryota with a word size of two and otherwise default settings. A non-redundant set of six cpFtsY sequences was obtained and aligned for a consensus sequence using ClustalW as described. A prokaryotic FtsY consensus sequence was obtained by blasting the same cpFtsY sequence against bacteria with 500 descriptions. Sequences were shortened to contain only the NG domain plus 25 N-terminal residues. Resulting sequences were reduced to a non-redundant set of 375 and aligned using ClustalW. The percentage of each residue represented in an alignment column represents the total number of appearances of an amino acid divided by the total number of residues in that column.RESULTSThe N-terminal Region of Mature cpFtsY Is Necessary for LHCP Integration and Thylakoid Membrane Binding—To understand whether the cpFtsY N terminus is functionally important in targeting of LHCP by cpSRP, cpFtsY was replaced with N-terminal deletion mutants (Fig. 1) in assays that reconstitute LHCP integration into isolated thylakoids. Proper integration of LHCP results in a protease-resistant degradation product, as shown in Fig. 2A. Deletion of cpFtsY residues 41–46 had little effect on LHCP integration, whereas further deletions (Δ41–49, Δ41–52, and Δ41–56) decreased integration by ∼90% relative to cpFtsY.FIGURE 2cpFtsY residues 47–49 (GFF) are required for LHCP integration and efficient thylakoid partitioning. A, integration of LHCP was reconstituted with salt-washed thylakoids using stromal extract or recombinant proteins and equimolar amounts of in vitro-translated cpFtsY construct as indicated. See “Experimental Procedures” and supplemental Fig. S1 for more information regarding the production of equimolar amounts of in vitro-translated constructs. Correctly integrated LHCP migrated as a protease-resistant (thermolysin) degradation product (DP). A lane of pLHCP (translation product (TP)) is shown for comparison. LHCP integration was calculated from a minimum of three separate experiments and is shown relative to the level of integration observed for the stroma. B, the membrane binding of radiolabeled cpFtsY constructs as indicated was examined by incubation with salt-washed (SW) thylakoids. Thylakoids were re-isolated, washed, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and phosphorimaging. The level of each membrane-bound cpFtsY construct was calculated from three separate experiments and is shown relative to bound cpFtsY.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To address membrane-partitioning competency, salt-washed thylakoids were incubated with radiolabeled cpFtsY N-terminal deletion constructs and repurified to remove unbound protein. Deletion of the first six residues (Δ41–43 and Δ41–46) reduced membrane binding to 40–50% of that observed for cpFtsY (Fig. 2B). Further N-terminal deletions (Δ41–49, Δ41–52, and Δ41–56) reduced membrane binding to only 13% of that seen for cpFtsY, correlating with the precipitous drop in LHCP integration observed for the same cpFtsY deletions (Fig. 2, A and B).Phe-48 and Phe-49 Are Required for Efficient Thylakoid Membrane Binding and LHCP Integration—cpFtsYNG+1 and cpFtsYNG+2, consisting of the cpFtsY NG domain (residues 50–366) and Phe-49 (+1) or Phe-48 and Phe-49 (+2), respectively (Fig. 1), were examined for their ability to support LHCP integration and bind thylakoids. Although cpFtsYNG+2 bound membranes with ∼50% lower efficiency than cpFtsY, this construct supported efficient (∼90% relative to cpFtsY) LHCP integration in vitro (Fig. 3, A and B). cpFtsYNG+1 associated with thylakoids with 25% the efficiency of cpFtsY and exhibited integration efficiency comparable with that found in assays conducted without added cpFtsY. These data imply that the cpFtsY N terminus plays an active role in thylakoid binding and that membrane binding retained by cpFtsYNG+1 is not productive in terms of supporting the role of cpFtsY in LHCP localization.FIGURE 3cpFtsY double-Phe motif (Phe-48 and Phe-49) plays a critical role in LHCP integration and thylakoid partitioning. A, integration of radiolabeled LHCP was reconstituted as described in the legend to Fig. 2A. Integration efficiency was calculated from three separate experiments and is presented relative to integration observed in the presence of the stroma.

https://openalex.org/W2020541754,"Background Cooking and heating remain the most energy intensive activities among the world's poor, and thus improved access to clean energies for these tasks has been highlighted as a key requirement of attaining the major objectives of the UN Millennium Development Goals. A move towards clean energy technologies such as biogas systems (which produce methane from human and animal waste) has the potential to provide immediate benefits for the control of neglected tropical diseases. Here, an assessment of the parasitic disease and energy benefits of biogas systems in Sichuan Province, China, is presented, highlighting how the public health sector can leverage the proliferation of rural energy projects for infectious disease control. Methodology/Findings First, the effectiveness of biogas systems at inactivating and removing ova of the human parasite Schistosoma japonicum is experimentally evaluated. Second, the impact of biogas infrastructure on energy use and environmental quality as reported by surveyed village populations is assessed, as is the community acceptance of the technology. No viable eggs were recovered in the effluent collected weekly from biogas systems for two months following seeding with infected stool. Less than 1% of ova were recovered viable from a series of nylon bags seeded with ova, a 2-log removal attributable to biochemical inactivation. More than 90% of Ascaris lumbricoides ova (used as a proxy for S. japonicum ova) counted at the influent of two biogas systems were removed in the systems when adjusted for system residence time, an approximate 1-log removal attributable to sedimentation. Combined, these inactivation/removal processes underscore the promise of biogas infrastructure for reducing parasite contamination resulting from nightsoil use. When interviewed an average of 4 years after construction, villagers attributed large changes in fuel usage to the installation of biogas systems. Household coal usage decreased by 68%, wood by 74%, and crop waste by 6%. With reported energy savings valued at roughly 600 CNY per year, 2–3 years were required to recoup the capital costs of biogas systems. In villages without subsidies, no new biogas systems were implemented. Conclusions Sustainable strategies that integrate rural energy needs and sanitation offer tremendous promise for long-term control of parasitic diseases, while simultaneously reducing energy costs and improving quality of life. Government policies can enhance the financial viability of such strategies by introducing fiscal incentives for joint sanitation/sustainable energy projects, along with their associated public outreach and education programs."
https://openalex.org/W2062022363,"Phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase mediates multiple pathways that regulate many aspects of the cell including metabolism, survival, migration, and proliferation. Both Akt and cytokine-independent survival kinase (CISK)/SGK3 are known AGC family protein kinases that function downstream of PI 3-kinase. Although the Akt signaling pathway has been studied extensively, the specific signaling cascades that are modulated by CISK remain to be elucidated. To understand CISK function, we affinity-purified the CISK protein complex and identified Flightless-I (FLII) as a novel downstream target of CISK. Here we show that FLII is an in vivo substrate of CISK that functions downstream of PI 3-kinase. CISK can associate with FLII and phosphorylate FLII at residues Ser(436) and Thr(818). FLII has been shown to act as a co-activator for nuclear hormone receptors such as estrogen receptor (ER). We demonstrate here that CISK can enhance ER transcription, which is dependent on its kinase activity, and mutation of CISK phosphorylation sites on FLII attenuates its activity as an ER co-activator. Furthermore, FLII knockdown by RNA interference renders 32D cells more sensitive to interleukin-3 withdrawal-induced apoptosis, suggesting that FLII itself is also a survival factor. These findings support the model that CISK phosphorylates FLII and activates nuclear receptor transcription and suggest a new cell survival signaling pathway mediated by PI 3-kinase and CISK."
https://openalex.org/W2129180922,"Adenosine, prostaglandin E(2), or increased intracellular cyclic AMP concentration each elicit potent anti-inflammatory events in human neutrophils by inhibiting functions such as phagocytosis, superoxide production, adhesion and cytokine release. However, the endogenous molecular pathways mediating these actions are poorly understood. In the present study, we examined their impact on the gene expression profile of stimulated neutrophils. Purified blood neutrophils from healthy donors were stimulated with a cocktail of inflammatory agonists in the presence of at least one of the following anti-inflammatory agents: adenosine A(2A) receptor agonist CGS 21680, prostaglandin E(2), cyclic-AMP-elevating compounds forskolin and RO 20-1724. Total RNA was analyzed using gene chips and real-time PCR. Genes encoding transcription factors, enzymes and regulatory proteins, as well as secreted cytokines/chemokines showed differential expression. We identified 15 genes for which the anti-inflammatory agents altered mRNA levels. The agents affected the expression profile in remarkably similar fashion, suggesting a central mechanism limiting cell activation. We have identified a set of genes that may be part of important resolution pathways that interfere with cell activation. Identification of these pathways will improve understanding of the capacity of tissues to terminate inflammatory responses and contribute to the development of therapeutic strategies based on endogenous resolution."
https://openalex.org/W2133812336,"RecA family proteins, including bacterial RecA, archaeal RadA, and eukaryotic Dmc1 and Rad51, mediate homologous recombination, a reaction essential for maintaining genome integrity. In the presence of ATP, these proteins bind a single-strand DNA to form a right-handed nucleoprotein filament, which catalyzes pairing and strand exchange with a homologous double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), by as-yet unknown mechanisms. We recently reported a structure of RadA left-handed helical filament, and here present three new structures of RadA left-handed helical filaments. Comparative structural analysis between different RadA/Rad51 helical filaments reveals that the N-terminal domain (NTD) of RadA/Rad51, implicated in dsDNA binding, is highly flexible. We identify a hinge region between NTD and polymerization motif as responsible for rigid body movement of NTD. Mutant analysis further confirms that structural flexibility of NTD is essential for RadA's recombinase activity. These results support our previous hypothesis that ATP-dependent axial rotation of RadA nucleoprotein helical filament promotes homologous recombination."
