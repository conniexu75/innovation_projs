https://openalex.org/W1991742987,"A device capable of separating biological cells (suspended in a conducting medium) according to volume has been developed. Cell volume is measured in a Coulter aperture, and the cells are subsequently isolated in droplets of the medium which are charged according to the sensed volume. The charged droplets then enter an electrostatic field and are deflected into a collection vessel. Mixtures of mouse and human erythrocytes and a large volume component of mouse lymphoma cells were separated successfully. In tests with Chinese hamster ovary cells essentially all cells survived separation and grew at their normal rate."

These species approach condylarths and leptictid and erinaceoid insectivores in structure. Purgatorius is referred to a new subfamily, Purgatoriinae, of the Paromomyidae, but is probably not the stem primate. The fauna of Purgatory Hill indicates a late early Paleocene age."

https://openalex.org/W2082894044,"Mycoplasma pneumoniae produces a soluble hemolysin active against guinea pig erythrocytes. This hemolysin appears to be a peroxide, since catalase or peroxidase inhibits its activity. The action of catalase and peroxidase is specific, since heating the enzymes abolishes their effect on the hemolysin. In addition, 3-amino- 1,2,4-triazole, a potent inhibitor of catalase, reverses the inhibitory effect of the enzyme. The hemolysin of M. laidlawii is also a peroxide. The hemolysins of M. pneumoniae and M. laidlawii seem unique for microbial organisms since the bacterial hemolysins which have been described have been protein or lipid in nature."

https://openalex.org/W95049276,"(Received for publication, March 4, 1965) Earlier reports from this laboratory have described rapid stimulations of ribonucleic acid synthesis in the livers of adrenal- ectomised rats treated with glucocorticoids (1) and in seminal vesicles of castrates after androgen administration (2). In the liver, the effect is limited to nuclear RNA synthesis, and begins between 30 and 45 min after hormone is given. Accumulation of the induced enzyme tyrosine-ar-ketoglutarate transaminase does not begin until 60 min after treatment, and thus the results are kinetically consistent with the conclusion that increased enzyme synthesis (3) is secondary to the hormonal stimulation of RNA synthesis. In the seminal vesicle, a marked elevation in the rate of RNA synthesis can be seen as early as 20 min after testosterone administration. In both organs, RNA synthesis is increased 2- to 3-fold within 2 hours of hormone treatment. These steroid effects on RNA synthesis are thus both rapid and large, and it seems reasonably safe to assume, first, that they play a signifi- cant role in the ultimate physiological shifts that occur as a result of steroid hormone treatment, and second, that RNA syn- thesis is closely linked to the primary site of action of these hormones. In this series, we describe the results of experiments in which we have analyzed the nature of the RNA synthesized in response to hydrocortisone and testosterone. In these experiments, we have used the differential thermal extraction procedure elaborated by Georgiev, Samarina, Lerman, Smirnov, and Severtzov (4), in which extraction with phenol at various temperatures is employed to separate the different types of RNA that are labeled when tissues are exposed to isotopic RNA precursors for a limited time. Extraction of tissue prep- arat.ions with phenol at low temperature yields a fraction con- taining most of the unlabeled tissue RNA as well as the low molecular weight labeled RNA components. In this paper, we will discuss the identification of these low molecular weight components, and the effect of steroid hormone treatment on the labeling of each. The labeled RNAs extracted at low tempera- ture include transfer RNA and a poorly defined heterogeneous fraction. Labeling of transfer RNA can be traced to terminal nucleotide turnover, which is hormone-independent, and to synthesis G% novo, which is stimulated by steroid hormones. * Research supported jointly by the National Institutes of Health, and by the United States Atomic Energy Commission under contract with the Union Carbide Corporation. t Postdoctoral Fellow of the American Cancer Society. $ Public Health Service Postdoctoral Fellow of the National Cancer Institute (Grant 6F2-CA-16, 375-OlAl).

The direction of effects on ambulation depended upon offspring genotype, while those depending on conditioning were unidirectional. Both effects were mediated prenatally by the mother."

https://openalex.org/W204227082,"SUMMARY During short incubation in vitro of intact Ehrlich ascites cells, 14C-bicarbonate was incorporat,ed into carbon atom 2 of the uracil ring derived from intracellular, acid-soluble uridine nu- cleotides. The incorporation was almost completely inhibited by erotic acid added to t,he medium, with accumulation of radio- activity in carbamylaspartate, thus confirming that bicarbonate incorporation into uridine nucleotides occurs by erotic acid pathway in these cells. The incorporation was increased by glucose and glutamine or ammonia. Glutamine produced maximum incorporation at much lower external concentrations than ammonium chloride. The incorporation was inhibited by the glutamine analogues, 0-carbamyl-n-serine and 6-diazo-5-oxo-r-norleucine. The effectiveness of these analogues and azaserine in inhibit- ing pyrimidine synthesis in Ehrlich ascites cells was compared with their effectiveness in inhibiting the glutamine-dependent carbamyl phosphate synthetase of crude extracts Escherichia coli. The dat,a suggest, and are consistent with, a synthesis of carbamyl phosphate in the Ehrlich ascites cell by an enzyme requiring bicarbonate and glutamine and the subsequent incor- poration of this carbamyl phosphate into uridine nucleotides by the erotic acid pathway. dcknowledgments-The"

https://openalex.org/W154541012,"SUMMARY The protein disulfide interchange enzyme, isolated from beef liver microsomes, has been further purified by gradient elution from diethylaminoethyl-Sephadex columns and by starch gel electrophoresis. The purified enzyme catalyzed the reactivation of fully reduced soybean trypsin inhibitor in the presence of either a soluble, dialyzable, fraction of liver homogenate, or dehydroascorbic acid. However, as described previously, the enzyme appears to be concerned only with the second stage of this process, namely the rearrangement of incorrectly paired half-cystine residues introduced during the oxidative step. Randomly cross-linked soybean trypsin inhibitor, prepared by oxidation of fully reduced material in 8 M urea, is rapidly con- verted to the native protein in the presence of mM P-mercapto- ethanol at a molar ratio for enzyme to protein substrate of 1:360. The present experiments establish the enzymic nature and generality of the reaction. Thus, randomly cross-linked bovine pancreatic ribonuclease and egg white lysozyme, both animal proteins, and soybean trypsin inhibitor, a plant protein, can all serve as substrates for the enzyme. Acknowledgment-We wish to thank Dr. K. Hoerman for his kind assistance with the experiments involving the purification of the enzyme by starch gel electrophoresis. REFERENCES 1."

The compound was chromatographically identical with a conjugate of amiben isolated from soybean plants, Glycine Max (L.) Merr. The seeds of a tolerant plant, soybean, and of a susceptible one, barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), were incubated in amiben labeled with carbon-14, and the seedlings were extracted. Essentially all the radioactivity in soybean was present as a compound corresponding to N-glycosyl amiben. Only a small amount of this conjugate was present in barley; most of the radioactivity was present as free amiben or as other unidentified metabolites."

Recently, LeCocq and Ballou6 confirmed this view, but Rose7 favoured a structure isomeric to that originally proposed by Pangborn8. Conclusive evidence about the structure of cardiolipin has now been obtained by means of chemical synthesis."

https://openalex.org/W2000217741,"Homozygous (f/f) but not heterozygous (f/+) mice of the highly congenic strain, FL/ Re, manifest a severe transitory siderocytic fetal anemia. Adults of both f/f and f/+ genotype manifest decreased hepatic, splenic, and renal levels of triangle up-amino-levulinate dehydratase (ALD) activity compared to homozygous (+/+) mice of the same strain. The degree of augmentation in splenic ALD activity following phenylhydrazine administration is high in +/+, intermediate in f/+, and low in f/f mice. These findings suggest that perhaps a deficiency in the fetal level of ALD may be responsible for the transitory fetal anemia."

This pigment was shown to be xanthophyll2, and a statistically highly significant and reproducible relationship was demonstrated between plasma non-esterified fatty acid level and xanthophyll content3. The possibility was considered that xanthophyll is passively mobilized from adipose tissue during fat mobilization and it therefore appeared that a similar relationship might obtain in the cow where carotenoids are usually present in the plasma."

https://openalex.org/W2028247469,"RECENT work from a number of laboratories suggests that the acquisition of tissue-specific enzyme patterns during embryonic development, and maintenance of these patterns in the adult, probably involves control of the expression of polycistronic operons by specific regulator compounds. These compounds can be recognized hormones1, specific macromolecules2,3, or, quite possibly, metabolic end-products of controlled cistrons. The number of regulator compounds required depends on the complexity of the organism and on the number and size of its operons; it is conceivable that an individual operon may carry instructions for more than one biosynthetic sequence. In this report the role of end-products in establishing tissue phenotypes will be examined."

https://openalex.org/W1976645027,"COLORIMETRIC tests are employed routinely for estimating the deoxyribonucleie acid (DNA) content of tissues. The diphenylamine test, originally described by Dische1, or subsequent modifications of it, are the most frequently used. Other colorimetric tests include Ceriotti's indole2 and the p-nitrophenylhydrazine (PNPH) proposed by Webb and Levy3. The latter is the most sensitive, but possesses the disadvantage of rapid colour fading. In 1963 Brown et al.4 proposed a modification of the PNPH test for plant leaf tissue that is more sensitive and stabilizes the colour. This modification, applied to animal tissue, does not increase the sensitivity of the original method, but it does reduce the colour fading. Essentially this test differs from the Webb–Levy technique in the extraction procedure since iso-amyl acetate replaces the butyl acetate. This is then followed by an extraction of ethyl ether to remove residual amyl acetate. Colour is developed in n-butyl alcohol made strongly alkaline by the addition of an equal volume of 50percent sodium hydroxide."
