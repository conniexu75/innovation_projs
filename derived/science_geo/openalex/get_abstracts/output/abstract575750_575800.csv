https://openalex.org/W2564214658,"An activity lift for platinum Platinum is an excellent but expensive catalyst for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), which is critical for fuel cells. Alloying platinum with other metals can create shells of platinum on cores of less expensive metals, which increases its surface exposure, and compressive strain in the layer can also boost its activity (see the Perspective by Stephens et al. ). Bu et al. produced nanoplates—platinum-lead cores covered with platinum shells—that were in tensile strain. These nanoplates had high and stable ORR activity, which theory suggests arises from the strain optimizing the platinum-oxygen bond strength. Li et al. optimized both the amount of surface-exposed platinum and the specific activity. They made nanowires with a nickel oxide core and a platinum shell, annealed them to the metal alloy, and then leached out the nickel to form a rough surface. The mass activity was about double the best reported values from previous studies. Science , this issue p. 1410 , p. 1414 ; see also p. 1378"
https://openalex.org/W2561754210,"Genetic screens help infer gene function in mammalian cells, but it has remained difficult to assay complex phenotypes-such as transcriptional profiles-at scale. Here, we develop Perturb-seq, combining single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-based perturbations to perform many such assays in a pool. We demonstrate Perturb-seq by analyzing 200,000 cells in immune cells and cell lines, focusing on transcription factors regulating the response of dendritic cells to lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Perturb-seq accurately identifies individual gene targets, gene signatures, and cell states affected by individual perturbations and their genetic interactions. We posit new functions for regulators of differentiation, the anti-viral response, and mitochondrial function during immune activation. By decomposing many high content measurements into the effects of perturbations, their interactions, and diverse cell metadata, Perturb-seq dramatically increases the scope of pooled genomic assays."
https://openalex.org/W2562947047,"Functional genomics efforts face tradeoffs between number of perturbations examined and complexity of phenotypes measured. We bridge this gap with Perturb-seq, which combines droplet-based single-cell RNA-seq with a strategy for barcoding CRISPR-mediated perturbations, allowing many perturbations to be profiled in pooled format. We applied Perturb-seq to dissect the mammalian unfolded protein response (UPR) using single and combinatorial CRISPR perturbations. Two genome-scale CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) screens identified genes whose repression perturbs ER homeostasis. Subjecting ∼100 hits to Perturb-seq enabled high-precision functional clustering of genes. Single-cell analyses decoupled the three UPR branches, revealed bifurcated UPR branch activation among cells subject to the same perturbation, and uncovered differential activation of the branches across hits, including an isolated feedback loop between the translocon and IRE1α. These studies provide insight into how the three sensors of ER homeostasis monitor distinct types of stress and highlight the ability of Perturb-seq to dissect complex cellular responses."
https://openalex.org/W2561508962,"In multicellular organisms, dedicated regulatory circuits control cell type diversity and responses. The crosstalk and redundancies within these circuits and substantial cellular heterogeneity pose a major research challenge. Here, we present CRISP-seq, an integrated method for massively parallel single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-pooled screens. We show that profiling the genomic perturbation and transcriptome in the same cell enables us to simultaneously elucidate the function of multiple factors and their interactions. We applied CRISP-seq to probe regulatory circuits of innate immunity. By sampling tens of thousands of perturbed cells in vitro and in mice, we identified interactions and redundancies between developmental and signaling-dependent factors. These include opposing effects of Cebpb and Irf8 in regulating the monocyte/macrophage versus dendritic cell lineages and differential functions for Rela and Stat1/2 in monocyte versus dendritic cell responses to pathogens. This study establishes CRISP-seq as a broadly applicable, comprehensive, and unbiased approach for elucidating mammalian regulatory circuits."
https://openalex.org/W2560926371,"The authors show that pregnancy involves substantial and consistent structural changes in the human brain, primarily located in regions subserving social cognition. These changes overlap with areas that respond to the mothers' babies and predict measures of postpartum maternal attachment. Moreover, they endure for at least 2 years after pregnancy. Pregnancy involves radical hormone surges and biological adaptations. However, the effects of pregnancy on the human brain are virtually unknown. Here we show, using a prospective ('pre'-'post' pregnancy) study involving first-time mothers and fathers and nulliparous control groups, that pregnancy renders substantial changes in brain structure, primarily reductions in gray matter (GM) volume in regions subserving social cognition. The changes were selective for the mothers and highly consistent, correctly classifying all women as having undergone pregnancy or not in-between sessions. Interestingly, the volume reductions showed a substantial overlap with brain regions responding to the women's babies postpartum. Furthermore, the GM volume changes of pregnancy predicted measures of postpartum maternal attachment, suggestive of an adaptive process serving the transition into motherhood. Another follow-up session showed that the GM reductions endured for at least 2 years post-pregnancy. Our data provide the first evidence that pregnancy confers long-lasting changes in a woman's brain."

However, roads also damage wild areas and rapidly contribute to habitat degradation and species loss. Ibisch et al. cataloged the world's roads. Though most of the world is not covered by roads, it is fragmented by them, with only 7% of land patches created by roads being greater than 100 km 2 . Furthermore, environmental protection of roadless areas is insufficient, which could lead to further degradation of the world's remaining wildernesses. Science , this issue p. 1423"
https://openalex.org/W2561012755,"Glioblastoma, the most common and aggressive malignant brain tumor, is propagated by stem-like cancer cells refractory to existing therapies. Understanding the molecular mechanisms that control glioblastoma stem cell (GSC) proliferation and drug resistance may reveal opportunities for therapeutic interventions. Here we show that GSCs can reversibly transition to a slow-cycling, persistent state in response to targeted kinase inhibitors. In this state, GSCs upregulate primitive developmental programs and are dependent upon Notch signaling. This transition is accompanied by widespread redistribution of repressive histone methylation. Accordingly, persister GSCs upregulate, and are dependent on, the histone demethylases KDM6A/B. Slow-cycling cells with high Notch activity and histone demethylase expression are present in primary glioblastomas before treatment, potentially contributing to relapse. Our findings illustrate how cancer cells may hijack aspects of native developmental programs for deranged proliferation, adaptation, and tolerance. They also suggest strategies for eliminating refractory tumor cells by targeting epigenetic and developmental pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2561089820,"Relatively few catalytic systems are able to control the stereochemistry of electronically excited organic intermediates. Here we report the discovery that a chiral Lewis acid complex can catalyze triplet energy transfer from an electronically excited photosensitizer. We applied this strategy to asymmetric [2 + 2] photocycloadditions of 2′-hydroxychalcones, using tris(bipyridyl) ruthenium(II) as a sensitizer. A variety of electrochemical, computational, and spectroscopic data rule out substrate activation by means of photoinduced electron transfer and instead support a mechanism in which Lewis acid coordination dramatically lowers the triplet energy of the chalcone substrate. We expect that this approach will enable chemists to more broadly apply their detailed understanding of chiral Lewis acid catalysis to stereocontrol in reactions involving electronically excited states."

These diamonds now appear to be distinctive not only in their size but also in their origin. Smith et al. probed mineral inclusions from these very large diamonds and found abundant slivers of iron metal surrounded by reducing gases. This suggests that the large diamonds grew from liquid metal in Earth's mantle. The inclusions also provide direct evidence of a long-suspected metal precipitation reaction that requires a more reducing mantle. Science , this issue p. 1403"
https://openalex.org/W2567255685,"S phase and mitotic onset are brought about by the action of multiple different cyclin-CDK complexes. However, it has been suggested that changes in the total level of CDK kinase activity, rather than substrate specificity, drive the temporal ordering of S phase and mitosis. Here, we present a phosphoproteomics-based systems analysis of CDK substrates in fission yeast and demonstrate that the phosphorylation of different CDK substrates can be temporally ordered during the cell cycle by a single cyclin-CDK. This is achieved by rising CDK activity and the differential sensitivity of substrates to CDK activity over a wide dynamic range. This is combined with rapid phosphorylation turnover to generate clearly resolved substrate-specific activity thresholds, which in turn ensures the appropriate ordering of downstream cell-cycle events. Comparative analysis with wild-type cells expressing multiple cyclin-CDK complexes reveals how cyclin-substrate specificity works alongside activity thresholds to fine-tune the patterns of substrate phosphorylation."

Previous structural studies of the HIV-1 capsid have relied on recombinant, cross-linked, or mutant capsid proteins. Mattei et al. now report subnanometer-resolution cryo–electron tomography structures of the HIV-1 capsid from intact virions. These structures confirm the hollow cone shape of the capsid and allow for the specific placement of each individual capsid hexamer and pentamer within the lattice structure.

Bacteria and archaea have developed a set of defense mechanisms to protect themselves against invaders such as phages and plasmids. Central among these are the R-M (restriction-modification) and CRISPR-Cas (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats-CRISPR associated) systems, which directly target the incoming phage/plasmid DNA (Dupuis et al., 2013Dupuis M.E.

Unlike the R-M systems, which provide generalized or innate protection against any invaders not possessing countermeasures, the CRSIPR-Cas system functions as the only adaptive immune system in prokaryotes by generating records of previous infections (Hille and Charpentier, 2016Hille F.

CRISPR-Cas systems are found in almost all archaea and about half of bacteria, showing extreme diversity of Cas protein composition, as well as genomic loci architecture (Makarova et al., 2011Makarova K.S.

Based on the architecture of the interference modules, the CRISPR-Cas systems can be broadly grouped into two classes: class 1 systems (including type I, III, and IV) possess multi-subunit protein complexes, whereas class 2 systems (including type II, V, and VI) rely on single effector proteins (Makarova et al., 2015Makarova K.S.

C2c1 (Figure 1A), a newly identified class 2 type V-B effector protein containing one RuvC domain but no HNH domain, has also been shown to be active for target DNA cleavage in vivo and in vitro (Shmakov et al., 2015Shmakov S. Abudayyeh O.O. Makarova K.S. Wolf Y.I. Gootenberg J.S. Semenova E. Minakhin L. Joung J. Konermann S.

The overall domain architecture of C2c1, in particular the organization of the RuvC domain, resembles Cpf1, but is distinct from Cas9. Similar to Cpf1, C2c1 recognizes a distal 5′-T-rich PAM sequence, in contrast to the proximal 3′-G-rich PAM favored by Cas9 (Shmakov et al., 2015Shmakov S. Abudayyeh O.O. Makarova K.S. Wolf Y.I.

Cell. 2015; 60: 385-397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar). However, the cleavage activity of C2c1 requires both crRNA and tracrRNA, a feature that is in sharp contrast to Cpf1, which only requires crRNA. Similar to Cas9, an engineered sgRNA generated by covalently fusing crRNA and tracrRNA can also guide C2c1 to cleave target DNA. An evolutionary study of class 2 systems suggests that Cas9/Cpf1/C2c1 proteins originated from distinct recombination events (Shmakov et al., 2015Shmakov S. Abudayyeh O.O. Makarova K.S. Wolf Y.I. Gootenberg J.S. Semenova E. Minakhin L. Joung J. Konermann S. Severinov K. et al.Discovery and Functional Characterization of Diverse Class 2 CRISPR-Cas Systems.Mol.

Compared to the extensive structural and functional studies of the Cas9 and Cpf1 systems, little is known about the C2c1 system as regards the molecular mechanisms underlying crRNA and tracrRNA recognition, as well as the cleavage pattern of target DNA. Based on previous research on structures of binary (Dong et al., 2016Dong D. Ren K. Qiu X. Zheng J. Guo M. Guan X. Liu H. Li N. Zhang B. Yang D. et al.The crystal structure of Cpf1 in complex with CRISPR RNA.Nature. 2016; 532: 522-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar) and ternary (Gao et al., 2016Gao P. Yang H.

Yang H. Rajashankar K.R. Huang Z. Patel D.J. Type V CRISPR-Cas Cpf1 endonuclease employs a unique mechanism for crRNA-mediated target DNA recognition.Cell Res. 2016; 26: 901-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), which is distinct from that reported for Cas9 (Jiang et al., 2015Jiang F. Zhou K. Ma L. Gressel S. Doudna J.A. STRUCTURAL BIOLOGY. A Cas9-guide RNA complex preorganized for target DNA recognition.Science. 2015; 348: 1477-1481Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Whether C2c1 uses a similar strategy to Cpf1 or Cas9, or is distinct from both of them, is still unknown. To better understand how C2c1 recognizes crRNA, tracrRNA, and target DNA, as well the principles underlying cleavage of both DNA strands, we determined the crystal structures of the Alicyclobacillus acidoterrestris C2c1 (AacC2c1) bound to sgRNA as a binary complex and to added target DNA containing the 5′-TTC-3′ PAM as ternary complexes. More importantly, we observed that both target and non-target DNA strands independently insert into the RuvC catalytic pocket in ternary complexes. The structural comparison of C2c1 with Cas9 and Cpf1 reveals that C2c1 employs a unique strategy for RNA and DNA recognition and cleavage. Cleavage by C2c1 generates a staggered double-strand break resulting in seven-nucleotide 5′ overhangs distal to the PAM site. Further, biochemical results show that C2c1 is active in the physiological temperature range. The structural and biochemical characterization of the C2c1 system reported in this study provides guidelines for future applications in genome engineering and related biotechnology applications. To avoid potential cleavage of the target DNA during crystallization, we mutated three conserved C2c1 RuvC domain acidic residues (Asp570, Glu848, and Asp977) to alanine, based on previous bioinformatics analysis of catalytic residue assignments in Cpf1 and C2c1 (Shmakov et al., 2015Shmakov S.

We have successfully crystallized the ternary complex of the triple catalytic mutant of full-length AacC2c1 in complex with a 111-nt sgRNA, a 28-nt target DNA, and a 8-nt non-target DNA strand containing a 5′-TTC-3′ PAM sequence (in excess) and solved the structure at 2.9 Å resolution (X-ray statistics summarized in Table S1). The overall structure of the ternary complex is shown in two views in Figure 1B, with the protein and nucleic acid domains color-coded as shown in Figures 1A and 1C, respectively. The structure of C2c1 in the ternary complex adopts an overall “Crab Claw” fold consisting of two lobes: an α-helical recognition (REC) lobe, including Helical-I and Helical-II, and a NUC lobe, including OBD, RuvC, and Nuc domains (Figure 1B). The bridge helix (BH) motif is inserted into the Helical-II domain in close proximity to the PAM-distal region of the guide:target heteroduplex. Helical-I domain of C2c1 (Figures 1B and S1A) resembles a “dumbbell” shape and consists of 14 α helices and 2 short β strands forming a small antiparallel β sheet between helix α1 and helix α2. Helices α1–α7 and helices α9–α14 form two separate regions that are located at the PAM-proximal and PAM-distal regions of the guide:target heteroduplex, respectively. The long helix α8, which connects the two helical bundles, is located in the minor groove of PAM-proximal region and extends to the PAM-distal region. The Helical-II domain of C2c1 (Figures 1B and S1A) consists of 6 α helices and interacts with PAM-distal regions of the guide:target heteroduplex at the opposite side to Helical-I domain. Unlike the BH motif in Cpf1, which forms a separate region and connects the REC and NUC lobes from the middle of the whole complex (Gao et al., 2016Gao P. Yang H. Rajashankar K.R. Huang Z. Patel D.J.

The OBD domain of C2c1 consists of a nine-stranded β sheet and two α helices (Figure S1B), which closely resembles the core region of the OBD domain of Cpf1 (Figure S1E). The OBD and Helical-I domains contact the PAM duplex. The RuvC domain of C2c1 (Figure S1C) is composed of an 8-stranded β sheet that is surrounded by 6 α helices and a β-hairpin formed by β7 and β8, which shows a closely similar conformation to the RuvC domain in Cpf1 (Figure S1F). The Nuc domain of C2c1 contains two β sheets and six α helices (Figure S1C), showing low structural similarity to the Nuc domain in Cpf1 (Figure S1F). The 111-nt sgRNA was derived by connecting the 3′ end of 78-nt tracrRNA to the 5′ end of 42-nt crRNA based on the predicted repeat:anti-repeat (R:AR) duplex as described previously (Shmakov et al., 2015Shmakov S. Abudayyeh O.O. Makarova K.S. Wolf Y.I. Gootenberg J.S. Semenova E. Minakhin L. Joung J. Konermann S. Severinov K. et al.Discovery and Functional Characterization of Diverse Class 2 CRISPR-Cas Systems.Mol. Cell. 2015; 60: 385-397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar). The crRNA sequence (in magenta) contains a 20-nt guide region and a 14-nt repeat region, whereas the tracrRNA sequence (in cyan) contains a 16-nt anti-repeat region and three stem loops (Figure 1C). The sgRNA and target DNA (in gray) form a T-shaped architecture, consisting of the guide:target heteroduplex, the R:AR duplex, three stem loops, and the PAM duplex (Figures 1C and 1D). The nucleotides dG(20) to dG(1) segment (all sequences are labeled from 5′ to 3′ ends) of the target DNA strand and C1 to C20 segment of the crRNA form the guide:target heteroduplex. The dG(−1) to dA(−8) segment of the target DNA strand and the dT(−8∗) to dC(−1∗) segment of the non-target DNA strand (PAM in red) form the PAM duplex (Figures 1C and 1D). In the crystal structure, the R:AR duplex comprises two regions: the predicted R:AR duplex-1 formed by nucleotides U(−13) to U(−6) of crRNA and G(−25) to A(−18) of tracrRNA (Shmakov et al., 2015Shmakov S. Abudayyeh O.O. Makarova K.S. Wolf Y.I. Gootenberg J.S. Semenova E. Minakhin L. Joung J. Konermann S.

The segment of the R:AR duplex-1 formed by U(−13) to A(−11) of crRNA and U(−20) to A(−18) of tracrRNA and the tetraloop A(−17) to C(−14) cannot be traced in the structure (dotted segment in Figures 1C and 1D). In addition, we are unable to trace nucleotides U(−75) to U(−73) between stem 1 and stem 2. The sgRNA is recognized by OBD, Helical-II, RuvC, and Nuc domains via extensive interactions, including several sequence-dependent intermolecular contacts (Figures 2A–2C, S2, and S3). The R:AR duplex-2 starts from G(−5) and ends at C(−1) of crRNA, with adjacent C1 of crRNA orienting in an opposite direction so as to pair with dG1 of the target DNA strand to form the guide:target heteroduplex (Figures 1C and 2B). In addition, U(−6) of crRNA orients and pairs with G(−25) of tracrRNA to form R:AR duplex-1 (Figures 1C and 2B). The phosphates of C1 and G(−5) are stabilized by interaction with Lys4 and Arg746, respectively (Figure 2B and S2). The R:AR duplex-2 is recognized mainly by the Helical-II and OBD domains involving both non-sequence-specific interactions with the sugar-phosphate backbone and sequence-specific interactions with the nucleobases (Figures 1C, 2B, and S2). The nucleobase of G(−63) hydrogen bonds with the side chain of Ser444 and both the side chain and main-chain of Gln446 in the OBD domain. The nucleobase G(−5) stacks with Arg746 and hydrogen bonds with the main chain of Gly747 in the Helical-II domain. The N2 atom of G(−61) and O2 atom of C(−60) hydrogen bond with the side chains of Asp807 and Lys811 in the Helical-II domain, respectively (Figure 2B). In contrast to the R:AR duplex-2, which forms extensive interactions with C2c1, the R:AR duplex-1 protrudes away from the whole complex and has almost no contacts with the protein. One end of R:AR duplex-1 and the adjacent tetraloop cannot be traced in the structure, indicating that these regions may be flexible due to lack of interactions with C2c1. Similarly, no contacts were observed between the end of R:AR duplex with the protein in the Cas9 system (Deltcheva et al., 2011Deltcheva E. Chylinski K. Sharma C.M. Gonzales K. Chao Y. Pirzada Z.A.

Hydrogen bonds and salt bridges are indicated with green lines. Hydrophobic and stacking interactions are shown by dashed orange lines. The interactions between substrate DNA strand and the RuvC and Nuc domain are described below. Stem 1 of the tracrRNA interacts with Helical-II, RuvC, and Nuc domains primarily by non-sequence-specific hydrogen bonds (Figures 2C and S2). The atoms N1, N2, and O6 of the flipped-out nucleobase G(−84) hydrogen bond with the side chains of Glu819 and Arg815 in the Helical-II domain and with Tyr839 in the RuvC domain. Another unpaired nucleobase, G(−86), is sandwiched by A(−85):U(−88) base pair and the side chain of Arg904 in the Nuc domain and, in addition, forms hydrogen bonds with Arg904 (Figure 2C and S2). Stem-loop 3 is recognized by hydrogen-bonding interactions between nucleotides G(−42) to C(−46) and the Helical-II domain (Figures S2 and S3C). The nucleobases of C(−46) and C(−45) form two hydrogen bonds with the side chains of Arg724 and Trp774, respectively (Figures S2 and S3C). No interaction was observed between stem 2 and the protein in the structure. The linker region A(−58) to G(−55) between R:AR duplex-2 and stem 3 of the tracrRNA is recognized by the Helical-II domain involving both sequence-dependent and backbone-binding interactions (Figures S2 and S3B). The nucleobases A(−57) and U(−56) hydrogen bond with the main chain of Ile745 and the side chains of Arg734 and Gln767, respectively. The nucleobase A(−58) flips out and is sandwiched by the side chains of Pro743 and Val753 (Figures S2, S3A, and S3B). The 20-bp guide:target heteroduplex is recognized primarily within a channel formed by REC lobe, BH motif, OBD domain, and RuvC domain in a sequence-independent way (Figures 2D, 2E, and S4). The PAM-proximal region of the heteroduplex interacts with the OBD, Helical-I, Helical-II, and RuvC domains (Figures 2E and S2). The +1 phosphate group between dG(−1) and dG1 of the target DNA strand is stabilized by the side chain of Arg507 and the main-chain amide group of Gly478 in the OBD domain, which facilitates the unwinding of +1 phosphate group and base pairing between dG1 of target DNA and C1 of crRNA. Arg507 is conserved in some species and Gly478 is highly conserved in the C2c1 family. Such “phosphate lock” type interactions have also been observed in Cas9 (Anders et al., 2014Anders C.

Human mutations in GATA4, a cardiogenic transcription factor, cause cardiac septal defects and cardiomyopathy. Here, iPS-derived cardiomyocytes from subjects with a heterozygous GATA4-G296S missense mutation showed impaired contractility, calcium handling, and metabolic activity. In human cardiomyocytes, GATA4 broadly co-occupied cardiac enhancers with TBX5, another transcription factor that causes septal defects when mutated. The GATA4-G296S mutation disrupted TBX5 recruitment, particularly to cardiac super-enhancers, concomitant with dysregulation of genes related to the phenotypic abnormalities, including cardiac septation. Conversely, the GATA4-G296S mutation led to failure of GATA4 and TBX5-mediated repression at non-cardiac genes and enhanced open chromatin states at endothelial/endocardial promoters. These results reveal how disease-causing missense mutations can disrupt transcriptional cooperativity, leading to aberrant chromatin states and cellular dysfunction, including those related to morphogenetic defects."
https://openalex.org/W2561883112,"Naive human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) can be derived from primed hESCs or directly from blastocysts, but their X chromosome state has remained unresolved. Here, we show that the inactive X chromosome (Xi) of primed hESCs was reactivated in naive culture conditions. Like cells of the blastocyst, the resulting naive cells contained two active X chromosomes with XIST expression and chromosome-wide transcriptional dampening and initiated XIST-mediated X inactivation upon differentiation. Both establishment of and exit from the naive state (differentiation) happened via an XIST-negative XaXa intermediate. Together, these findings identify a cell culture system for functionally exploring the two X chromosome dosage compensation processes in early human development: X dampening and X inactivation. However, remaining differences between naive hESCs and embryonic cells related to mono-allelic XIST expression and non-random X inactivation highlight the need for further culture improvement. As the naive state resets Xi abnormalities seen in primed hESCs, it may provide cells better suited for downstream applications."

https://openalex.org/W2564326418,"Metformin has utility in cancer prevention and treatment, though the mechanisms for these effects remain elusive. Through genetic screening in C. elegans, we uncover two metformin response elements: the nuclear pore complex (NPC) and acyl-CoA dehydrogenase family member-10 (ACAD10). We demonstrate that biguanides inhibit growth by inhibiting mitochondrial respiratory capacity, which restrains transit of the RagA-RagC GTPase heterodimer through the NPC. Nuclear exclusion renders RagC incapable of gaining the GDP-bound state necessary to stimulate mTORC1. Biguanide-induced inactivation of mTORC1 subsequently inhibits growth through transcriptional induction of ACAD10. This ancient metformin response pathway is conserved from worms to humans. Both restricted nuclear pore transit and upregulation of ACAD10 are required for biguanides to reduce viability in melanoma and pancreatic cancer cells, and to extend C. elegans lifespan. This pathway provides a unified mechanism by which metformin kills cancer cells and extends lifespan, and illuminates potential cancer targets. PAPERCLIP."

Here we identify human-specific mechanisms regulating X chromosome activity in early embryonic development. Single-cell RNA sequencing and imaging revealed co-activation and accumulation of the long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) XACT and XIST on active X chromosomes in both early human pre-implantation embryos and naive human embryonic stem cells. In these contexts, the XIST RNA adopts an unusual, highly dispersed organization, which may explain why it does not trigger X chromosome inactivation at this stage. Functional studies in transgenic mouse cells show that XACT influences XIST accumulation in cis. Our findings therefore suggest a mechanism involving antagonistic activity of XIST and XACT in controlling X chromosome activity in early human embryos, and they highlight the contribution of rapidly evolving lncRNAs to species-specific developmental mechanisms.

Our findings therefore suggest a mechanism involving antagonistic activity of XIST and XACT in controlling X chromosome activity in early human embryos, and they highlight the contribution of rapidly evolving lncRNAs to species-specific developmental mechanisms. In mammals, the activity of the X chromosomes has to be tightly controlled to accommodate the disequilibrium of X-linked gene dosage between males and females. This is achieved through compensatory mechanisms, which serve to equalize X chromosome expression between sexes and relative to autosomes (Disteche, 2016Disteche C.M. Dosage compensation of the sex chromosomes and autosomes.Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2016; 56: 9-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). While X chromosome dosage compensation is essential for proper development, the underlying strategies vary extensively between species. In the mouse, for instance, X chromosome inactivation (XCI) is initiated rapidly after zygotic genome activation (ZGA), several divisions prior to blastocyst implantation. In contrast, human pre-implantation development proceeds in the apparent absence of XCI; instead, dosage compensation is transiently achieved by reducing the expression of both X chromosomes in females (Petropoulos et al., 2016Petropoulos S. Edsgärd D. Reinius B. Deng Q. Panula S.P. Codeluppi S. Plaza Reyes A. Linnarsson S. Sandberg R. Lanner F.

The mechanisms underlying these differences are still poorly understood. XCI is triggered by the accumulation of the long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) XIST on the chromosome, which recruits protein complexes involved in chromatin remodeling, chromosome structuration, and nuclear organization (Chu et al., 2015Chu C. Zhang Q.C. da Rocha S.T. Flynn R.A. Bharadwaj M. Calabrese J.M. Magnuson T. Heard E. Chang H.Y.

A comprehensive Xist interactome reveals cohesin repulsion and an RNA-directed chromosome conformation.Science. 2015; 349: aab2276Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Strikingly, however, in human pre-implantation embryos, XIST accumulates on every X chromosome in both males and females without inducing robust transcriptional repression or enrichment of H3K27me3, a hallmark of the inactive state (Okamoto et al., 2011Okamoto I. Patrat C. Thépot D. Peynot N. Fauque P. Daniel N. Diabangouaya P. Wolf J.P. Renard J.P. Duranthon V. Heard E. Eutherian mammals use diverse strategies to initiate X-chromosome inactivation during development.Nature. 2011; 472: 370-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). This unusual configuration suggests the existence, in embryos, of mechanisms preventing XIST-mediated XCI, which would to some extent be specific to the human, since in the mouse Xist accumulation systematically results in the inactivation of the coated chromosome. We recently have identified XACT, an X-linked lncRNA that coats active X chromosomes in human pluripotent stem cells. XACT is weakly conserved across mammals and is absent from the mouse, suggesting that it could fulfill a primate-specific function (Vallot et al., 2013Vallot C. Huret C. Lesecque Y. Resch A. Oudrhiri N. Bennaceur-Griscelli A. Duret L. Rougeulle C. XACT, a long noncoding transcript coating the active X chromosome in human pluripotent cells.Nat. Genet. 2013; 45: 239-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Insight into such function came from the analysis of XCI status and its instability in human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). XCI has indeed been established in most hESCs derived so far, but this status is unstable and hallmarks of the inactive state are spontaneously and irreversibly lost in culture. This erosion of XCI is characterized by the loss of XIST expression, loss of H3K27me3 enrichment, DNA hypomethylation, and partial gene reactivation (Mekhoubad et al., 2012Mekhoubad S.

Accumulation of XACT is also a feature of the eroded X and occurs early during the erosion process, prior to the loss of XIST and to gene reactivation (Vallot et al., 2015Vallot C. Ouimette J.F. Makhlouf M. Féraud O. Pontis J. Côme J. Martinat C. Bennaceur-Griscelli A. Lalande M. Rougeulle C.

This order of events suggests that XACT could participate in the instability of XCI in hESCs by influencing XIST expression, XIST RNA activity, or localization. Here we show that XACT is expressed in human pre-implantation embryos, where it accumulates, together with XIST, on active X chromosomes. We also report an in vitro context of naive pluripotency that recapitulates the in vivo situation, thus defining a unique pre-inactivation state in human development. Functional evidences further indicate that XACT influences XIST accumulation in cis, suggesting that dosage compensation establishment in human involves the antagonistic action of two lncRNAs. To investigate the biological relevance of XACT and its putative function in XCI, we probed its expression in vivo, in the early stages of human development. We analyzed four independent sets of single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data generated from human pre-implantation embryos, which we grouped into two datasets (Figure 1A) based on the methods used to classify embryos. In dataset 1 (Blakeley et al., 2015Blakeley P. Fogarty N.M. del Valle I. Wamaitha S.E. Hu T.X. Elder K. Snell P. Christie L. Robson P. Niakan K.K.

Single-cell RNA-seq reveals lineage and X chromosome dynamics in human preimplantation embryos.Cell. 2016; 165: 1012-1026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar), embryos (88 embryos; n = 1,529 cells) are classified according to the day of development, ranging from embryonic day E3 to E7. The major burst of zygotic XIST and XACT expression occurred concomitantly between the four-cell and the eight-cell stages (Figure 1B). XIST was undetectable prior to these stages, while there was a modest maternal contribution for XACT (average fragments per kilobase per million mapped reads [FPKM] = 0.005 from oocyte to two-cell stage). The expression of XIST and XACT was strongly correlated at early stages of development (from E3 to early E5) in both female and male embryos, suggesting that the two noncoding genes, which are located 40 Mb apart on the X, might be co-regulated (Figure 1C; Figure S1B). This correlation was likely significant and not only due to ZGA, as it was not observed for any other X-linked genes (lower panel, Figure 1C). However, XIST-XACT correlation did not persist in later-stage embryos (from E5 to E7, Figure S1D). In females, XIST and XACT were maintained co-expressed in epiblast (EPI and EPI-TE) and primitive endoderm (PE) cells. In contrast, trophectoderm (TE) cells displayed variable XACT levels (Figure 1D) while maintaining stable XIST expression. Such a pattern suggests that, once initiated, the expression of XIST and XACT can be regulated independently, in agreement with the persistence of XIST expression from the inactive X chromosome in differentiated cells where XACT is repressed (Vallot et al., 2013Vallot C. Huret C. Lesecque Y. Resch A. Oudrhiri N. Bennaceur-Griscelli A. Duret L. Rougeulle C. XACT, a long noncoding transcript coating the active X chromosome in human pluripotent cells.Nat.

DePristo M.A. The Genome Analysis Toolkit: a MapReduce framework for analyzing next-generation DNA sequencing data.Genome Res. 2010; 20: 1297-1303Crossref PubMed Scopus (14912) Google Scholar), we used the normalized number of X-linked bi-allelic positions as a marker of X chromosome activity in female cells (Figures S1E and S1F). The number of bi-allelic positions on the X decreased significantly with developmental stage in both datasets compared to several autosomes (Figure 1E; Figures S1G and S1H), indicative of a potential initiation of X chromosome silencing. Although this contrasts somewhat with a recent report that concluded an absence of XCI at these stages (Petropoulos et al., 2016Petropoulos S. Edsgärd D. Reinius B. Deng Q. Panula S.P. Codeluppi S. Plaza Reyes A. Linnarsson S. Sandberg R. Lanner F. Single-cell RNA-seq reveals lineage and X chromosome dynamics in human preimplantation embryos.Cell. 2016; 165: 1012-1026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar), the discrepancy may be due to the choice of threshold for calling bi-allelic positions (i.e., allelic ratio, Figure S1I). Altogether, these findings suggest the existence of an expression imbalance between the two X chromosomes starting at E6, which can be interpreted as an initiation of XCI. Strikingly, XACT-negative cells were the ones displaying the lowest numbers of X-linked bi-allelic positions (Figure 1F, p = 0.0066), potentially linking in time the repression of XACT to the initiation of XCI. Single-cell RNA-seq analysis thus revealed that XACT and XIST can be simultaneously expressed within a given cell and likely from a given chromosome, as extrapolated from male samples. The known ability of these two noncoding transcripts to individually coat the chromosome from which they are expressed prompted us to investigate their nuclear distributions at the single-cell level in human pre-implantation embryos. This also enabled us to refine our understanding of the timing and allelism of expression and the localization of XACT and XIST by precise developmental scoring of embryos, through the use of a blastocyst morphological classification (Gardner et al., 2000Gardner D.K. Lane M. Stevens J. Schlenker T. Schoolcraft W.B. Blastocyst score affects implantation and pregnancy outcome: towards a single blastocyst transfer.Fertil. Steril. 2000; 73: 1155-1158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1213) Google Scholar) and the assessment of total cell counts for each embryo. RNA-fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis of one female morula and eight male and 11 female blastocysts not only confirmed the expression of XACT at these developmental stages but also further demonstrated that XACT retains its ability to form an RNA cloud in vivo (Figure 2A). XACT coated the single X chromosome in males and one or both Xs in the majority of cells of female morula and early blastocysts, with a tendency to shift from bi- to mono-allelic expression as female blastocysts increased in cell number (Figure S2A). The overall proportion of cells with XACT expression decreased as development progressed (Figure 2B). Our prior RNA-seq analysis together with visual observation of labeled blastocysts suggests that XACT-negative cells are from the TE. Simultaneous RNA-FISH for XIST and XACT in male and female blastocysts showed that both transcripts were often co-expressed from the X chromosome and accumulated in large domains within the nucleus (Figure 2C). XIST and XACT RNAs were, however, differentially distributed and the two signals barely overlapped (Figure 2C, zooms, Figure 2D), indicating that XIST and XACT transcripts occupy distinct nuclear territories. While the expression of XIST remained constant from the early (B1) to late/hatching (B5) blastocyst stage (Figure 2E), the proportion of cells with co-accumulation of XACT and XIST decreased according to the blastocyst cell number (Figure S2B), in agreement with the loss of XACT expression in a subset of blastocyst cells. In addition, no recurrent pattern could be identified when the relative allelic expression of XIST and XACT were compared (Figure S2C), confirming that, once activated, XIST and XACT can be regulated independently and suggesting some degree of stochasticity in their expression in blastocysts. In vivo pre-inactivation status in human is thus characterized by the co-accumulation of XACT and XIST on active X chromosomes, in both males and females. hESCs in a pre-inactive state have been reported (Gafni et al., 2013Gafni O.

USA. 2014; 111: 4484-4489Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar), but this status appears to be difficult to generate and maintain in culture. In addition, determining the X chromosome activity status in hESCs could prove challenging, given the spontaneous propensity of the inactive X to undergo partial reactivation in cultured hESCs and the resulting confusion between pre-inactive and eroded states (Vallot et al., 2015Vallot C. Ouimette J.F. Makhlouf M. Féraud O. Pontis J. Côme J. Martinat C. Bennaceur-Griscelli A. Lalande M. Rougeulle C.

More importantly, none of the naive-state hESCs reported so far have displayed XIST expression, as would be predicted from the data presented here and from previous analysis of XIST RNA status in human embryos (Okamoto et al., 2011Okamoto I. Patrat C. Thépot D. Peynot N. Fauque P. Daniel N. Diabangouaya P. Wolf J.P. Renard J.P. Duranthon V. Heard E. Eutherian mammals use diverse strategies to initiate X-chromosome inactivation during development.Nature. 2011; 472: 370-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Additional protocols to capture naive hESCs have been described recently; in these cases, the epigenetic, metabolic, and transcriptomic signatures were strongly indicative of naive-state pluripotency (Takashima et al., 2014Takashima Y. Guo G. Loos R. Nichols J. Ficz G. Krueger F. Oxley D. Santos F. Clarke J.

We first studied in primed H9 female hESCs and in their naive derivatives (Takashima et al., 2014Takashima Y. Guo G. Loos R. Nichols J. Ficz G. Krueger F. Oxley D. Santos F. Clarke J. Mansfield W. et al.Resetting transcription factor control circuitry toward ground-state pluripotency in human.Cell. 2014; 158: 1254-1269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar) the expression of ATRX and FGD1, since these two X-linked genes resist XCI erosion (Vallot et al., 2015Vallot C. Ouimette J.F. Makhlouf M. Féraud O. Pontis J. Côme J. Martinat C. Bennaceur-Griscelli A. Lalande M. Rougeulle C.

Patrat C. Thépot D. Peynot N. Fauque P. Daniel N. Diabangouaya P. Wolf J.P. Renard J.P. Duranthon V. Heard E. Eutherian mammals use diverse strategies to initiate X-chromosome inactivation during development.Nature. 2011; 472: 370-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Both genes were indeed mono-allelically expressed in the parental, primed hESCs. In striking contrast, two pinpoints for ATRX and FGD1 were detected in 84% and 83%, respectively, of the naive cells, demonstrating that the conversion from primed to naive states was accompanied by substantial X chromosome reactivation (XCR) (Figures 3A and 3B ). The presence of two active Xs in naive cells was further confirmed by allelic analysis of RNA-seq datasets (GEO: GSE60945 of Takashima et al., 2014Takashima Y. Guo G. Loos R. Nichols J. Ficz G. Krueger F. Oxley D. Santos F. Clarke J. Mansfield W. et al.Resetting transcription factor control circuitry toward ground-state pluripotency in human.Cell. 2014; 158: 1254-1269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar), which revealed an increase in bi-allelically expressed genes in the naive state as compared to primed cells (from 55% to 76%, p = 0.0070, Figure 3C). More strikingly, while XIST was fully and uniformly repressed in the parental primed cells, indicating that these cells had undergone XCI erosion, XIST was strongly upregulated in naive hESCs, and it accumulated in the nucleus in over 80% of naive H9 on one or two Xs (Figures 3A and 3B). The expression of XIST was, however, highly unstable, and the percentage of cells with two or even one XIST RNA cloud displayed high batch-to-batch variability. This variation occurred independently of the activity status of the X chromosome, which remained remarkably constant (Figure 3D). Bi-allelic ATRX expression and XIST accumulation on one or both Xs was similarly observed in an independent naive cell line WIBR3 (Figure 3E) (Theunissen et al., 2014Theunissen T.W. Powell B.E. Wang H. Mitalipova M. Faddah D.A. Reddy J. Fan Z.P. Maetzel D. Ganz K. Shi L. et al.Systematic identification of culture conditions for induction and maintenance of naive human pluripotency.Cell Stem Cell. 2014; 15: 471-487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). We also investigated whether the commercially available RSeT-defined medium (STEMCELL Technologies) could efficiently revert XCI, but we did not detect bi-allelic expression of ATRX or XIST expression, revealing that XCR did not occur in these conditions (Figures S3A–S3D). We probed the chromatin landscape of the X chromosomes in naive female H9 hESCs. Confocal analyses of immunofluorescence (IF) profiles for various histone marks combined to XIST RNA-FISH first showed an absence of H3K27me3 and H3K9me3 within the XIST RNA domain (Figure 3F), indicating that XIST accumulation in this context was not sufficient to trigger recruitment of repressive histone marks. This was reminiscent of the situation in human embryos where no H3K27me3 enrichment was detected on the XIST-coated chromosome (Okamoto et al., 2011Okamoto I. Patrat C. Thépot D. Peynot N. Fauque P. Daniel N. Diabangouaya P. Wolf J.P. Renard J.P. Duranthon V. Heard E. Eutherian mammals use diverse strategies to initiate X-chromosome inactivation during development.Nature. 2011; 472: 370-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Analysis of published chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) datasets (Theunissen et al., 2014Theunissen T.W. Powell B.E. Wang H. Mitalipova M. Faddah D.A. Reddy J. Fan Z.P. Maetzel D.

Imbeault M. et al.Molecular criteria for defining the naive human pluripotent state.Cell Stem Cell. 2016; 19: 502-515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar) confirmed the lack of H3K27me3 and H3K9me3 enrichment on the X in naive hESCs compared to the Xi in XIST-expressing primed cells (Figure S3E). Strikingly, IF analysis of H3K4me2 and H3K27Ac further revealed that the X chromosomes in naive hESCs, although active, resided in nuclear territories relatively devoid of active histone marks (Figure 3F). We next investigated XACT expression in naive hESCs by RNA-FISH. XACT was expressed and accumulated on every X chromosome in the majority of naive H9 and WIBR3 cells (Figure 3G; Figure S3F), and this pattern was stably maintained in culture (Figure 3G). In cells in which XIST also was expressed, the two lncRNAs, although produced from the same chromosome(s), accumulated in distinct nuclear domains; as in embryos, no overlap could be detected between XIST and XACT signals (Figure 3H, median Spearman correlation score r = −0.32). Reinforcing the similarity between naive hESC and pre-implantation embryos, qualitative analysis revealed a much more dispersed XIST RNA-FISH signal in conditions where the Xs were active (embryos and naive hESCs) than in XIST-expressing primed hESCs (Wilcoxon rank test p value < 10−16 and p < 10−13, respectively), in which XIST coated an inactive X chromosome (Figure 3I). The different distribution of the XIST signal in naive versus primed pluripotent cells might underlie its limited ability to silence the chromosome in cis. The dispersed nature of the XIST RNA signal on active X chromosomes in human embryos and naive hESCs where it accumulates with XACT, together with the lack of co-localization of XIST and XACT, raises the hypothesis that XACT might perturb the tight localization of XIST across the chromosome and/or its silencing capacities. To test these hypotheses, we sought to generate a system in which XACT expression would precede XIST upregulation. For this, we inserted a BAC transgene containing a large part of XACT including its promoter region into mouse ESCs. By using first an untargeted approach, we obtained one clone (clone R1) in which insertion of the XACT BAC randomly occurred on one of the two Xs, distal to the Xist locus, as shown by DNA-FISH on metaphase spreads (Figure 4B). We next used the CRISPR/Cas9 technology to force the insertion of the BAC onto the X, by targeting the integration between the protein-coding genes Amot and Htr2c, which corresponds to the XACT syntenic region on the mouse X chromosome (Figure 4A) (Vallot et al., 2013Vallot C. Huret C. Lesecque Y. Resch A. Oudrhiri N. Bennaceur-Griscelli A. Duret L. Rougeulle C. XACT, a long noncoding transcript coating the active X chromosome in human pluripotent cells.Nat. Genet. 2013; 45: 239-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Using this strategy, we isolated several clones with transgene insertion on the X, two of which were selected for further investigation (T1 and T9). As the control we used clones in which an unrelated BAC containing the human FGD1 gene was similarly inserted on the X and clones in which XACT was inserted on autosomes (Figure S4A). XACT expression was specifically detected in the clones with XACT BAC transgenes, and in most clones XACT formed an RNA cloud in a large proportion of cells (Figure 4B; Figure S4A). The copy number of inserted BACs for each of these clones was determined by real-time qPCR (Figure S4E). Xist was appropriately upregulated, albeit to variable extents, when transgenic clones were induced to differentiate, while XACT expression tended to decrease upon differentiation, similar to what has been observed in humans (Vallot et al., 2013Vallot C. Huret C. Lesecque Y. Resch A. Oudrhiri N. Bennaceur-Griscelli A. Duret L. Rougeulle C. XACT, a long noncoding transcript coating the active X chromosome in human pluripotent cells.Nat. Genet. 2013; 45: 239-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) (Figures S4B and S4C). Within the population of cells in which XACT expression was maintained, we observed a significant bias in the choice of the Xist-coated chromosome, with Xist being preferentially upregulated from the X not carrying XACT in the R1 and T9 clones (Figure 4C; Fisher’s exact test, p < 10−4). However, in the T1 clone (as in clones in which the FGD1 BAC was integrated on the X, Figure S4D), Xist was able to accumulate similarly on the transgenic and wild-type (WT) X chro"

These results should inform the design of strategies to eradicate tumor cell communities. The acquisition of a gain-of-function mutation in the KRAS gene is a driver of malignant transformation in a wide number of tissues (Stephen et al., 2014Stephen A.G. Esposito D. Bagni R.K. McCormick F. Dragging ras back in the ring.Cancer Cell. 2014; 25: 272-281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar). Collateral damage to the emergence of such mutations is an increase in the exposure of mutant KRAS cells to stress-inducing conditions (e.g., genotoxic, proteotoxic, and metabolic stress) due to the loss of normal proliferative barriers and the disruption of tissue homeostasis (Downward, 2015Downward J.

Thus, the successful expansion of KRAS tumors is dependent on the engagement of stress-adaptive mechanisms that enable cells to grow and survive under adverse conditions (Solimini et al., 2007Solimini N.L.

These stress-adaptive mechanisms are also largely responsible for the notorious drug resistance of KRAS cancers to chemotherapeutic agents (Eberhard et al., 2005Eberhard D.A. Johnson B.E. Amler L.C.

By extension, understanding the molecular mechanisms through which mutant KRAS confers stress resistance has the potential to inform the development of new targeting strategies that may have significant therapeutic implications. Stress granules (SGs) are characterized as non-membranous cytosolic structures consisting of mRNA and protein that form upon cellular exposure to a variety of stress stimuli, including oxidative, nutritional, genotoxic, proteotoxic, and osmotic stress, UV irradiation and chemotherapeutic agents and are required for cells to cope with stress (Kedersha et al., 2013Kedersha N. Ivanov P. Anderson P. Stress granules and cell signaling: more than just a passing phase?.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2013; 38: 494-506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). The current view holds that SG assembly occurs downstream of stress-induced translational arrest, with the pool of stalled mRNAs serving as the scaffold for the recruitment of RNA-binding proteins, which, in turn, recruit a plethora of signaling molecules (Anderson et al., 2015Anderson P. Kedersha N. Ivanov P. Stress granules, P-bodies and cancer.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2015; 1849: 861-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, Buchan and Parker, 2009Buchan J.R. Parker R.

Anderson P. Stress granules and cell signaling: more than just a passing phase?.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2013; 38: 494-506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). As such, SGs are thought to operate as platforms for signal compartmentalization and regulation of pathway activity. In support of this idea, the recruitment of TORC1 and dual specificity tyrosine phosphorylation-regulated kinase (DYRK) 3 to SGs has been shown to regulate the timing of TORC1 inactivation and reactivation in stressed cells (Wippich et al., 2013Wippich F. Bodenmiller B. Trajkovska M.G. Wanka S. Aebersold R. Pelkmans L. Dual specificity kinase DYRK3 couples stress granule condensation/dissolution to mTORC1 signaling.Cell. 2013; 152: 791-805Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). In addition, it has been demonstrated that the association of RACK1 with SGs leads to the inhibition of stress-induced activation of p38/JNK signaling, thereby compromising p38/JNK-mediated apoptosis (Arimoto et al., 2008Arimoto K. Fukuda H. Imajoh-Ohmi S. Saito H. Takekawa M. Formation of stress granules inhibits apoptosis by suppressing stress-responsive MAPK pathways.Nat. Cell Biol. 2008; 10: 1324-1332Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). While the critical role of SGs in the cellular stress response is well established, their contribution to tumor cell fitness is less understood. Here, we demonstrate that SG formation is elevated in mutant KRAS cells in response to a variety of stress stimuli. The upregulation of SGs is mediated by mutant KRAS-dependent pathways that control prostaglandin metabolism and confer cytoprotection by cell autonomous and cell non-autonomous mechanisms. Intercepting these pathways leads to the sensitization of mutant KRAS cells to stress stimuli and chemotherapeutic agents. Our results define a previously unappreciated paracrine mechanism exploited by mutant KRAS tumors to counteract stress. This mechanism could serve to establish a stress-resistant environment consisting of cells with diverse genetic and lineage backgrounds, and, as such, may dictate responsiveness to therapeutic intervention. To monitor SG formation, we have used a well-documented assay in which the cellular distribution of SG resident proteins is assessed by immunofluorescence (Kedersha and Anderson, 2007Kedersha N. Anderson P. Mammalian stress granules and processing bodies.Methods Enzymol. 2007; 431: 61-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). As illustrated in Figure 1A, exposure of mutant KRAS colorectal cancer cells DLD1 (hereafter referred to as DLD1 Mut) to oxidative stress via treatment with sodium arsenate (SA) was associated with the induction of SGs as indicated by the accumulation of cytoplasmic puncta containing two well-established SG markers: endogenous endoribonuclease RAS GTPase-activating protein-binding protein 1 (G3BP) and endogenous eukaryotic initiation factor 4G (eIF4G) (Kedersha and Anderson, 2007Kedersha N. Anderson P. Mammalian stress granules and processing bodies.Methods Enzymol. 2007; 431: 61-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). To establish a quantitative readout for SG formation, we applied the ImageJ analyze-particle tool to calculate the fraction of the total area of SGs in the total cell area visualized. Using this approach, we compared the induction of SGs in response to oxidative stress across a panel of human pancreatic and colorectal adenocarcinoma cell lines (Figure 1B). This analysis revealed that the levels of SGs displayed by mutant KRAS negative (KRAS wild-type [WT]) cancer cells, including cancer cells that harbored oncogenic mutations in BRAF (HT-29) or BRAF/PI3K (NCI H747), was significantly lower compared to cancer cells that harbored KRAS mutations (KRAS Mut). Together, these observations suggest that mutant KRAS may play a regulatory role in SG formation. To determine whether mutant KRAS is a causative factor leading to elevated SG levels, we assessed SG formation under experimental conditions where mutant KRAS expression was conditionally suppressed or switched on. Inducible short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-directed knockdown of KRAS in the KRAS mutant pancreatic cancer cell lines PL45, Panc-1, MiaPaCa-2, and AsPC-1 resulted in a significant attenuation of SG formation in response to oxidative stress (Figures 1C and S1A). In addition, SG formation was reduced by approximately 5-fold in an isogenic derivative of DLD1 Mut cells where the mutant KRAS allele had been knocked out (DLD1 knockout [KO]) (Shirasawa et al., 1993Shirasawa S. Furuse M. Yokoyama N. Sasazuki T. Altered growth of human colon cancer cell lines disrupted at activated Ki-ras.Science. 1993; 260: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar), (Figures 1D and S1B). Conversely, inducible expression of mutant KRAS (KRASV12) in HeLa Tet-ON KRASV12 cells led to an approximate 5-fold elevation in SG levels following exposure to oxidative stress (Figure 1E). Upregulation of SGs by mutant KRAS was reflected in significantly larger average size and number of SGs per cell (Figure S1C). Together, these observations indicate that mutant KRAS is necessary and sufficient for SG upregulation under oxidative stress conditions. Moreover, expression of mutant HRAS (HRASV12) also enhanced SG levels, indicating that acquisition of an activating mutation in other RAS isoforms also confers SG upregulation (data not shown). To define the molecular pathways through which mutant KRAS upregulates SGs, we investigated three key Ras-effector pathways: KRAS/RAF, KRAS/RALGEF, and KRAS/PI3K. To do so, we utilized the RAS effector domain mutants KRASV12,T35S, KRASV12,E37G, or KRASV12,Y40C, which preferentially activate the RAF, RALGEF, or PI3K pathway, respectively. HeLa cells transiently expressing KRASV12,T35S upregulated SGs ∼5-fold over mock transfected cells, similar to KRASV12-expressing cells (Figure 1F). In contrast, HeLa cells expressing KRASV12,Y40C showed no upregulation, whereas expression of KRAS,V12E37G led to a modest upregulation (∼2-fold) (Figure 1F). These results implicate the RAF pathway as a major mediator for KRAS-induced SG upregulation. Consistent with this, treatment with the MEK inhibitor PD0325901 impaired the capacity of HeLa Tet-ON KRASV12 cells to form SGs (Figure S1D). In addition to oxidative stress, several other tumor-associated stresses have been shown to induce SGs (Arimoto et al., 2008Arimoto K. Fukuda H. Imajoh-Ohmi S. Saito H. Takekawa M.

To test whether mutant KRAS-dependent upregulation of SGs displays specificity for a particular type of stress, we subjected DLD1 Mut and DLD1 KO cells to various stress stimuli. As illustrated in Figure 1G, the presence of mutant KRAS was associated with elevated levels of SG induction in response to ultraviolet C (UV-C) irradiation (∼6-fold) and the chemotherapeutic agents oxaliplatin (∼6-fold) and velcade (∼5-fold), which induce DNA damage and proteotoxic stress, respectively. These results are consistent with a role for mutant KRAS in regulating fundamental aspects of SG formation that are common to diverse stress stimuli. SGs are dynamic structures that form and dissipate with kinetics that can vary depending on the type of stress (Kedersha and Anderson, 2007Kedersha N. Anderson P. Mammalian stress granules and processing bodies.Methods Enzymol. 2007; 431: 61-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar, Kedersha et al., 2008Kedersha N. Tisdale S. Hickman T. Anderson P. Real-time and quantitative imaging of mammalian stress granules and processing bodies.Methods Enzymol. 2008; 448: 521-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Time-course analysis of SG levels revealed that DLD1 Mut cells displayed more than 5-fold elevation of SG levels relative to DLD1 KO cells at the 30 min time point following exposure to sodium arsenate, and this trend was maintained until their dissolution at the 120 min time point (Figure S1E). Similarly, DLD1 Mut cells showed ∼5-fold elevated SG levels compared to DLD1 KO cells at 3 hr following UV-C irradiation, when SGs start to become apparent, and a similar trend is maintained for the 24 hr time course after which SGs dissipate (Figure S1F and data not shown). Similar results were obtained for oxaliplatin and velcade (data not shown). Together, these results indicate that mutant KRAS promotes the rate and extent of SG formation. To investigate whether the effect of mutant KRAS on SG levels observed in cell culture conditions is manifested in vivo, we evaluated SGs in the pancreata of LSL-KRasG12D/+;LSL-Trp53R172H/+;Pdx-1-Cre (KPC) mice (Hingorani et al., 2005Hingorani S.R.

As shown in Figure 2A, the SG marker G3BP showed a diffuse cytoplasmic distribution in normal pancreatic tissue. In contrast, G3BP accumulated in cytoplasmic granular structures in the majority of lesions resembling early pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanINs) and in all lesions displaying a phenotype of advanced PanINs. Importantly, SGs were readily detected in tissue sections from human pancreatic adenocarcinoma, as visualized by G3BP (Figure 2B) or poly A mRNA binding protein 1 (PABP1) (Figure S2A) staining, but not in adjacent normal pancreatic tissue (Figure 2C). Furthermore, SGs were prominent in human xenograft tumors from the KRAS mutant cell lines DLD1 Mut and PL45 (Figure S2B). In comparison, no SGs were detected in xenografts of the KRAS WT cell line BxPC3 (Figure S2B), affirming that the upregulation of SGs in vivo is associated with the presence of mutant KRAS.Figure S2Mutant KRAS Upregulates SGs In Vivo, Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A) Sections from two independent human PDAC tissues were immunostained for G3BP and PABP1.(B) Sections from subcutaneous xenograft tumors of KRAS Mut (PL45, DLD1) and KRAS WT (BxPC-3) cells were immunostained for G3BP and CK8 (epithelial marker).

Images are representative from 3 animals per cohort. High magnification of boxed areas (3x zoom-in) are shown on the right. We next sought to determine the mechanism through which mutant KRAS promotes SG upregulation. The main regulatory events that have been identified as essential for SG formation are the phosphorylation of the eukaryotic initiation factor eIF2α and the inactivation of the eukaryotic initiation factor eIF4A (Kedersha et al., 2013Kedersha N. Ivanov P. Anderson P. Stress granules and cell signaling: more than just a passing phase?.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2013; 38: 494-506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). Both events lead to a decrease in translation initiation rates, which provides the surge in non-polysomal RNA, which functions as a scaffold for SG nucleator proteins. In addition, overexpression of SG nucleating proteins can lead to SG assembly, even in the absence of stress stimuli (Kedersha and Anderson, 2007Kedersha N. Anderson P. Mammalian stress granules and processing bodies.Methods Enzymol. 2007; 431: 61-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). We first asked whether upregulated SG levels in DLD1 Mut versus DLD1 KO cells occur as a consequence of increased eIF2α phosphorylation. Both DLD1 Mut and DLD1 KO cells displayed similar levels of p-eIF2α following exposure to sodium arsenate or oxaliplatin, demonstrating that elevated SG levels in DLD1 Mut cells cannot be merely attributed to higher p-eIF2α levels (Figure 3A and data not shown). Of note, neither sodium arsenate nor oxaliplatin treatment led to an increase in the phosphorylation of eIF2α over basal levels (Figure 3A and data not shown), consistent with earlier reports demonstrating that eIF2α is constitutively phosphorylated in cancer cells (Silvera et al., 2010Silvera D. Formenti S.C. Schneider R.J. Translational control in cancer.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2010; 10: 254-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). Furthermore, DLD1 Mut and DLD1 KO cells showed similar levels of G3BP and eIF4A (Figure 3A), ruling out the possible contribution of a preferential increase in the levels of these SG nucleators. We next examined whether mutant KRAS regulates SGs through eIF4A inactivation. A characteristic property of eIF4A-regulated SGs is the presence of eIF2α and eIF5 initiation factors, which are absent from p-eIF2α-dependent SGs (Bordeleau et al., 2005Bordeleau M.E. Matthews J. Wojnar J.M. Lindqvist L. Novac O. Jankowsky E. Sonenberg N. Northcote P. Teesdale-Spittle P. Pelletier J. Stimulation of mammalian translation initiation factor eIF4A activity by a small molecule inhibitor of eukaryotic translation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2005; 102: 10460-10465Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, Silvera et al., 2010Silvera D. Formenti S.C. Schneider R.J. Translational control in cancer.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2010; 10: 254-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). Consistent with mutant KRAS-driven SG upregulation being dependent on eIF4A inactivation, but not eIF2α phosphorylation, SGs in the KRAS mutant cells DLD1 Mut and MiaPaCa2 were positive for eIF2α and eIF5 (Figures 3B and S3A). The inactivation of eIF4A and the consequential induction of SGs has been reported to occur through covalent modification of eIF4A by the bioactive lipid prostaglandins 15-deoxy-delta 12,14-prostaglandin J2 (15-d-PGJ2) and prostaglandin A1 (PGA1) (Kim et al., 2007Kim W.J. Kim J.H. Jang S.K. Anti-inflammatory lipid mediator 15d-PGJ2 inhibits translation through inactivation of eIF4A.EMBO J. 2007; 26: 5020-5032Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). We reasoned that if SG upregulation by mutant KRAS is mediated by 15-d-PGJ2-dependent inactivation of eIF4A, then the treatment of cells with 15-d-PGJ2 would obviate the requirement of mutant KRAS for the upregulation of SGs. Consistent with this postulate, incubation of DLD1 KO cells with 15-d-PGJ2 was sufficient to induce the accumulation of SGs to a similar level to that was observed in DLD1 Mut cells (Figures 3C and S3B). This effect was specific to 15-d-PGJ2, because the addition of another prostaglandin, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), did not induce SGs (Figure S3C). The capacity of 15-d-PGJ2 to enhance SG formation raises the possibility that, in mutant KRAS cells, this response might be linked to mutant KRAS-regulated changes in prostaglandin levels. The accumulation of prostaglandin in tissues is controlled by the relative rates of biosynthesis and breakdown. The rate-limiting step in prostaglandin biosynthesis is catalyzed by cyclooxygenases (COX) 1 and/or 2, whereas prostaglandin degradation is catalyzed by the NAD+-dependent 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase (HPGD). Suppression of mutant KRAS expression in colon and pancreatic cancer cells led to an attenuation of PTGS2 (COX-2) levels and an upregulation of HPGD (Figures 3D, 3E, and S3D). These results suggest that mutant KRAS can control prostaglandin accumulation by enhancing biosynthesis and/or attenuating catabolism. In support of this idea, analysis of ONCOMINE data from tissue samples from pancreatic adenocarcinomas where KRAS mutations are highly prevalent (∼90% of patients) revealed significant PTGS2 upregulation as well as HPGD downregulation compared to normal pancreatic tissue (Figure S3E). Consistent with a regulatory role for mutant KRAS in prostaglandin accumulation, we also observed a significant enrichment of PTGS2 in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) tumors with KRAS mutations compared to tumors with wild-type KRAS (Figure S3F). To investigate the significance of mutant KRAS-mediated prostaglandin accumulation in SG upregulation, we used pharmacological inhibitors of the relevant enzymatic activities. COX-1/2 inhibition attenuated SG levels in DLD1 Mut cells subjected to sodium arsenate (Figures 3F and S3G), and this effect was reversed by the addition of 15-d-PGJ2 (Figure 3G). Furthermore, in DLD1 KO cells, pharmacological inhibition of HPGD rescued the levels of oxidative stress-induced SGs (Figures 3H and S3H). Taken together, these results indicate that the increase in prostaglandin levels by upregulating prostaglandin biosynthesis and/or downregulating prostaglandin catabolism is essential for mutant KRAS-induced upregulation of SGs. Because 15-d-PGJ2 is a secreted molecule, in principle, it could regulate its targets in a cell autonomous and/or cell non-autonomous fashion. This raises the possibility that, by regulating 15-d-PGJ2 production, mutant KRAS might exert cell non-autonomous control of SG levels. To test this idea, we initially measured the extracellular amounts of 15-d-PGJ2 and its precursor PGD2 by ELISA. The levels of 15-d-PGJ2 and PGD2 detected in conditioned medium from DLD1 Mut cells (KRAS conditioned medium [KCM]) were significantly higher compared with DLD1 KO cells (Figure 4A). Furthermore, conditioned media from MiaPaCa-2 and AsPC-1 cells, in which KRAS has been knocked down, had significantly lower levels of 15-d-PGJ2 compared to MiaPaCa-2 and AsPC-1 shRNA control cells (Figure S4). These results demonstrate that mutant KRAS promotes the extracellular accumulation of 15-d-PGJ2.Figure S4KRAS Knockdown Impairs Secreted 15-d-PGJ2 Levels, Related to Figure 4Show full captionThe levels of 15-d-PGJ2 that were secreted by MiaPaCa-2 and AsPC-1 cells expressing inducible scramble (Scr) or KRAS shRNA were determined by ELISA of the respective cell culture medium.

Data are represented as mean -/+ SEM. ∗∗p < 0.05. Next, we investigated the effects of KCM on SG levels in KRAS WT cells. Incubation of DLD1 KO in KCM from DLD1 Mut cells resulted in SG upregulation in response to oxidative stress, UV-C irradiation, oxaliplatin-induced DNA damage, and velcade-induced proteotoxic stress (Figure 4B). KCM from DLD1 Mut cells also led to a significant enhancement of SG levels in RAS WT 5637 bladder cancer cells and HeLa cells, confirming that this is not a cell-type-specific effect (data not shown). To formally prove that 15-d-PGJ2 is directly responsible for the SG-enhancing activity displayed by KCM, we performed an immunodepletion experiment using a 15-d-PGJ2 antibody. The capacity of KCM from DLD1 Mut cells to upregulate SGs in DLD1 KO cells was abolished following 15-d-PGJ2 immunodepletion (Figure 4C). Moreover, KCM from DLD1 Mut cells that had been treated with a COX-1/2 inhibitor failed to exhibit the stimulatory effect on SG formation in DLD1 KO cells (Figure 4D), supporting a role for prostaglandin biosynthesis in the cell non-autonomous regulation of SGs. Altogether, these results establish 15-d-PGJ2 as a secreted molecule through which mutant KRAS cells modulate SG levels in a cell non-autonomous fashion. Because SGs have been shown to be critical for cellular survival in response to stress, we asked whether SGs could contribute to mutant KRAS-mediated resistance to stress stimuli and chemotherapeutic agents. Inhibition of SGs by emetine treatment, which stalls mRNA in polysomes and thus blocks SG assembly, enhanced oxidative stress-induced apoptosis in mutant KRAS-expressing HTO-KRASV12, but not in HTO wild-type cells (Figures S5A and S5B). In addition, treatment of DLD1 Mut cells with a COX-1/2 inhibitor, which inhibits SG formation, enhanced sensitivity to oxaliplatin (Figure 5A). Taken together, these results indicate a dependence of mutant KRAS cells on SGs for resistance to stress stimuli.Figure 5KRAS Cancer Cells Exert Cell Non-autonomous Protection from Chemotherapeutic Agents via SG UpregulationShow full caption(A) Medium obtained from DLD1 Mut cells treated with or without diclofenac sodium (COX-i) was utilized to dilute oxaliplatin at the indicated concentrations and added back to the respective conditions for 48 hr.

To understand the neural mechanisms of attention, we must discern how attentional modulation varies by cell type and across cortical layers. Here, we test whether attention acts non-selectively across cortical layers or whether it engages the laminar circuit in specific and selective ways. We find layer- and cell-class-specific differences in several different forms of attentional modulation in area V4. Broad-spiking neurons in the superficial layers exhibit attention-mediated increases in firing rate and decreases in variability. Spike count correlations are highest in the input layer and attention serves to reduce these correlations. Superficial and input layer neurons exhibit attention-dependent decreases in low-frequency (<10 Hz) coherence, but deep layer neurons exhibit increases in coherence in the beta and gamma frequency ranges. Our study provides a template for attention-mediated laminar information processing that might be applicable across sensory modalities."

To protect the body from osmotic stress, posterior pituitary-projecting, vasopressin-secreting neurons (VPpp neurons) counter osmotic perturbations by altering their release of vasopressin, which controls renal water excretion. Vasopressin levels begin to fall within minutes of water consumption, even prior to changes in blood osmolality. To ascertain the precise temporal dynamics by which water or food ingestion affect VPpp neuron activity, we directly recorded the spiking and calcium activity of genetically defined VPpp neurons. In states of elevated osmolality, water availability rapidly decreased VPpp neuron activity within seconds, beginning prior to water ingestion, upon presentation of water-predicting cues. In contrast, food availability following food restriction rapidly increased VPpp neuron activity within seconds, but only following feeding onset. These rapid and distinct changes in activity during drinking and feeding suggest diverse neural mechanisms underlying anticipatory regulation of VPpp neurons."
https://openalex.org/W2563934553,"Axonal injury is a common cause of neurological dysfunction. Unfortunately, in contrast to axons from the peripheral nervous system, the limited capacity of regeneration of central nervous system (CNS) axons is a major obstacle for functional recovery in patients suffering neurological diseases that involve the subcortical white matter. Urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) is a serine proteinase that upon binding to the urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR) catalyzes the conversion of plasminogen into plasmin on the cell surface. uPAR expression increases after an injury, and signaling through uPAR promotes tissue remodeling. However, it is yet unknown whether uPA binding to uPAR has an effect on axonal recovery in the CNS. Here, we used in vitro and in vivo models of CNS axonal injury to test the hypothesis that uPA binding to uPAR promotes axonal regeneration in the CNS. We found that newly formed growth cones from axons re-emerging from an axonal injury express uPAR and that binding of uPA to this uPAR promotes axonal recovery by a mechanism that does not require the generation of plasmin. Our data indicate that the binding of recombinant uPA or endogenous uPA to uPAR induces membrane recruitment and activation of β1 integrin via the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein-1 (LRP1), which leads to activation of the Rho family small GTPase Rac1 and Rac1-induced axonal regeneration. Our results show that the uPA/uPAR/LRP1 system is a potential target for the development of therapeutic strategies to promote axonal recovery following a CNS injury."

Thus, overlaps are not just consequences of evolutionary constraints, but rather can provide population fitness advantages. The sequencing of the first complete DNA genome, ΦX174, revealed the startling discovery that genes can overlap with one another (Barrell et al., 1976Barrell B.G. Air G.M. Hutchison 3rd, C.A.

Computational analyses of protein structure have demonstrated that overlapped proteins in all viruses tend toward intrinsic disorder (Rancurel et al., 2009Rancurel C. Khosravi M. Dunker A.K. Romero P.R. Karlin D. Overlapping genes produce proteins with unusual sequence properties and offer insight into de novo protein creation.J. Virol. 2009; 83: 10719-10736Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), but how structured and/or functional regions are divided at the amino acid level remains unknown. It is possible to envisage two extreme models for this simultaneous evolution: (1) a “segregated” model in which the amino acid/nucleotide preferences for one gene dominate and the other gene accommodates with no observable benefit to itself, or (2) a “shared” model in which both genes exert selective forces at the same site, enforcing strong conservation in both frames (Figure S1). It is unlikely that segregated or shared decisions are uniform over an entire overlap, so defining the selective forces on a per residue basis becomes critical to understanding how the functions of a pair of proteins can be properly balanced. HIV-1 provides a compelling model as it contains eight distinct areas of coding overlap (Figure S2A) constituting ∼8% of its entire genome, and extensive sequence information from many virus isolates is available (Foley et al., 2013Foley B.

Theoretical Biology and Biophysics Group, Los Alamos National Laboratory, NM2013Google Scholar) (https://www.hiv.lanl.gov/content/index). The tat and rev regulatory genes (Figure 1A) are a particularly interesting case as both are essential for virus replication and thus experience strong simultaneous selective pressure, both have well-established functions and assays, and both have partial structures available to help interpret the functional consequences of sequence variants (Figure S2B) (Daugherty et al., 2010Daugherty M.D. Liu B.

Tat activates transcriptional elongation at the HIV-1 promoter via its interactions with host transcription factors (most notably P-TEFb) and an RNA element at the 5′ end of viral transcripts known as trans-activation response element (TAR) (Ott et al., 2011Ott M.

Rev facilitates the nuclear export of partially spliced and unspliced viral RNAs that encode essential late-stage viral proteins and genomic RNA for packaging (Pollard and Malim, 1998Pollard V.W.

Rev binds as an oligomer to an RNA element present in viral introns known as the Rev response element (RRE) and guides the RNAs to the cytoplasm via interactions with the Crm1 nuclear export machinery.Figure 1Organization and Conservation of HIV-1 OverlapsShow full caption(A) Layout of the Genetic Organization of the tat/rev overlap in HIV-1.

In order to understand the consequences of the tat/rev overlap for viral evolution, we compare sequence conservation in patient isolates to comprehensive residue-by-residue functional maps of Tat and Rev generated by alanine scanning. We further compare these datasets to replication experiments in viruses in which we removed the tat/rev overlap and subsequently measured the experimental fitness of every amino acid at each position in each protein independently. We find that HIV-1 has evolved in a segregated manner—to separate functionally important amino acids for Tat and Rev—and moreover, the arrangement decreases sampling of unfit genotypes, thereby turning an apparent genetic constraint into a fitness advantage. The combination of these orthogonal datasets provides the most complete picture of an overlap to date and demonstrates another way in which HIV-1 has efficiently utilized the coding capacity of its small genome to optimally arrange its core regulatory machinery. In order to explore the constraints imposed in the tat/rev overlap, we first examined the conservation of each protein residue in the HIV-1 proteome using patient data from the Los Alamos Database (https://www.hiv.lanl.gov/content/index). These datasets comprise ∼2,000 HIV-1 sequences in high-quality alignments. We then calculated the Shannon entropy for each residue of each HIV-1 protein. We used this relatively simple metric—in which a low value indicates high amino acid conservation—as it requires no assumptions about selection or substitution rates, which are challenging to approximate in overlapped regions. Furthermore, this metric has previously been used to quantify diversity of viral sequences, to identify interaction surfaces on proteins, and analyze overlapping reading frames (Pan and Deem, 2011Pan K. Deem M.W. Quantifying selection and diversity in viruses by entropy methods, with application to the haemagglutinin of H3N2 influenza.J. R. Soc.

Independent evolution of overlapping polymerase and surface protein genes of hepatitis B virus.J. Gen. Virol. 2007; 88: 2137-2143Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). We examined each residue in every HIV-1 gene and compared the single, double, and triple reading frame regions to one another (Figure S2C) and discovered that overlapped regions were, surprisingly, not more conserved than single-frame regions. This behavior held for almost every HIV-1 gene (Figure 1B), although this may reflect inherent biases in the structural features of these proteins as opposed to the presence of dual coding. Regardless, these results demonstrate that regions of overlap do not experience high conservation, providing evidence against a shared organization (with the caveat that positive selection and variations in mutational tolerance can confound this analysis). Genome-wide selection analyses using sophisticated evolutionary rate calculations have produced results consistent with this data, although the inability to accurately estimate neutral substitution (or determine selective forces on a per-residue basis) have prevented these studies from definitively interpreting these findings (Ngandu et al., 2008Ngandu N.K.

Mapping of positive selection sites in the HIV-1 genome in the context of RNA and protein structural constraints.Retrovirology. 2011; 8: 87Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). To narrow our focus and analyze specific residues within Tat and Rev, we defined a statistic, normalized-to-mean entropy (NME), in which the entropy of each residue was normalized to the average entropy of the one-frame regions of the viral genome. We reasoned that amino acid conservation within single-frame regions reflects a simple requirement for protein function without the confounding constraints of an overlapping gene. Thus a NME <1 would be suggestive of functional importance even within overlapped regions. We calculated the NME values of all residues from Tat and Rev that share two nucleotides within a codon—for example, Y47 of Tat (tAT) shares two nucleotides with M1 of Rev (ATg)—and plotted Rev NME versus Tat NME (Figure 1C). By separating the plot into quadrants, we can speculatively classify residues according to their conservation for one protein alone (Tat or Rev), for both (Shared), or for neither. Thus, we can tentatively hypothesize that residues highly conserved in only either the Tat or Rev reading frame are segregated, devoted to a single protein while residues conserved in both frames may share functionally important positions. However, this naive classification requires detailed experimental testing as it does not attempt to estimate a neutral rate of substitution or consider the extent to which the organization of the genetic code may constrain the codon possibilities at the overlapped positions. To evaluate which amino acids in Tat and Rev are conserved for function versus those restricted by codon usage in the alternative frame, we generated complete sets of alanine point mutants for both proteins and tested their activities in separate cell-based reporter systems, effectively removing the coding constraint of the overlap. Tat activity was measured by its ability to enhance transcription of an integrated firefly luciferase gene under the control of the HIV-1 promoter (D’Orso and Frankel, 2010D’Orso I. Frankel A.D. RNA-mediated displacement of an inhibitory snRNP complex activates transcription elongation.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2010; 17: 815-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) (Figure S3A), and Rev activity was measured by co-transfecting each mutant with a CMV-driven, RRE-containing, gag-pol reporter that produces viral capsid (p24) in a Rev-dependent manner (Smith et al., 1990Smith A.J. Cho M.I. Hammarskjöld M.L. Rekosh D. Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Pr55gag and Pr160gag-pol expressed from a simian virus 40 late replacement vector are efficiently processed and assembled into viruslike particles.J. Virol. 1990; 64: 2743-2750PubMed Google Scholar) (Figure S3B). Heatmaps (Figures 2A and 2B ) and graphs (Figures S3C and S3D) show the relative activities of each mutant, normalized to a reference sequence (HXB2 and NL4-3 isolates), and highlight the functionally important residues, which correspond well to established motifs of these proteins. As expected, mutation of conserved residues among patient isolates in the single-frame region of Tat (Figure 1A) correlated well with loss of function (Figure 2C). The remainder of tat overlaps with rev, env, or vpr, whereas rev overlaps with tat or env over its entire length. Within the tat/rev overlapped region, mutation of residues conserved in either only Tat or only Rev correlated with their respective loss of function, whereas mutation of residues not conserved in either protein generally did not affect function (Figure 2C). Somewhat surprisingly, however, mutation of residues that show conservation in both frames generally correlated with loss of function of only one of the proteins (Figure 2C).Figure 2Functional Dissection of Tat and RevShow full caption(A and B) Alanine scanning of Tat (A) and Rev (B) in functional reporter assays.(C) Relationship between entropy and function.

Dark blue residues are important for Tat function (<50% activity) while dark red residues are important for Rev (<50%activity). Only Tat Y47 and Rev M1 share nucleotides. See also Figure S3. To examine more closely if residues in this overlapping region might be simultaneously important for both proteins, we plotted the activities of Tat and Rev mutants against one another and found, remarkably, that almost no sites contributed to both functions, with one exception (Figure 2D, “Shared” quadrant). This result stands in stark contrast to the naive expectation from the entropy analysis (Figure 1D versus Figure 2D). This functional segregation at the single amino acid level, despite the overlap, is readily apparent when the important functional amino acids are mapped onto their primary structures (Figure 2E). The lone exception is the overlap between Tat Y47 and the Rev initiation codon M1, where Y47 is important for Tat activity and M1 is important only for Rev protein synthesis, as mutating the Rev start codon in the context of an N-terminally tagged Rev has no effect on activity (Figure S3D). The striking segregation of functional residues suggests that Tat and Rev conform to a segregated model of evolution. Our patient dataset contained several sites that were conserved in both the tat and rev frames. Our functional data suggests that this conservation is not a consequence of simultaneous selection for the function of both proteins, but rather reflects the requirements of only a single protein with subsequent restriction imposed by the genetic code in the alternative frame. If this is true, then we would expect the conserved but non-functional sites to mutate more freely absent the constraint of the overlap. To examine this, we created viruses (NL4-3 isolate) in which the tat and rev genes were engineered into different parts of the viral genome by first mutating either the tat or rev start codon and introducing downstream stop codons, synonymous in the alternative frame, to ablate the endogenous locus. We then generated exhaustive libraries of tat or rev variants in which every individual codon was randomized and cloned the resulting codon library into the non-essential nef region of the genome (Figure S4A). This resulted in 202 virus pools (116 for rev and 86 for tat), each composed of 64 different alleles. We performed independent, competitive replication experiments with each pool and determined allele frequencies, pre- and post-selection, by deep sequencing (Figure S4B). In order to infer selection from the changes in allele frequency, we developed a Wright-Fisher based model (Feder et al., 2014Feder A.F. Kryazhimskiy S. Plotkin J.B. Identifying signatures of selection in genetic time series.Genetics. 2014; 196: 509-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, Wright, 1931Wright S. Evolution in Mendelian populations.Genetics. 1931; 16: 97-159Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using population numbers from our own replication data (Figure S4B). This model allowed us to estimate the experimental fitness for each allele and statistically test if the allele was significantly under selection (given experimental error and the possibility of neutral variation) (Figure S5A). This method has an overall high correspondence (Figure S5B) with logarithmic fitness values often calculated in deep mutational scanning experiments (McLaughlin et al., 2012McLaughlin Jr., R.N. Poelwijk F.J. Raman A. Gosal W.S. Ranganathan R. The spatial architecture of protein function and adaptation.Nature. 2012; 491: 138-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar) but has the advantage that statistical testing, rooted in population genetics principles, can be performed to assess confidence in selection values (Figure S5C). We used this model to calculate the mean selection coefficient (experimental fitness) for each amino acid allele (grouping synonymous codons) to produce non-overlapped mutational profiles of Tat and Rev (Figures 3 and 4). Amino acid experimental fitness profiles were clustered by chemical properties (Firnberg et al., 2014Firnberg E. Labonte J.W. Gray J.J. Ostermeier M. A comprehensive, high-resolution map of a gene’s fitness landscape.Mol. Biol. Evol. 2014; 31: 1581-1592Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) to help visualize side chain preferences at every position, and the resulting landscapes were compared to the overlapped patient frequencies (Figures 3 and 4).Figure 3Mutational Profiling of HIV-1 TatShow full captionLeft: experimental fitness of every residue (all synonymous codons grouped) of Tat in non-overlapped tat-in-nef viruses after approximately six generations of selection in SupT1 cells.

Therefore, the effects of MEF2C on excitatory synapse development may depend on the circuit examined and/or some effects are due to indirect or non-cell autonomous effects of Mef2c deletion. Here, we demonstrate that MEF2C in postsynaptic layer (L) 2/3 pyramidal neurons of somatosensory barrel cortex cell-autonomously and differentially regulates experience-dependent development of local and long-range excitatory input pathways. To this end, MEF2C promotes connectivity of local excitatory inputs onto L2/3 neurons, but functions to suppress the strength of inputs from long-range, contralateral neocortical regions. Our results reveal new and unexpected roles for MEF2 genes in regulation of specific synaptic inputs and provide key molecular insight into experience-dependent development of neocortical circuits. To determine the cell-autonomous role of MEF2 genes in development of neocortical circuits, we deleted the major Mef2 genes in a sparse (1%–5%) population of neocortical neurons by injecting AAV-Cre-GFP into the ventricles of mice floxed (fl/fl) for either Mef2c or Mef2a and Mef2d at postnatal day 1 (P1). Because Mef2c is the most abundant Mef2 gene expressed in neocortex, it was the initial focus of our study. AAV-Cre-GFP infection in dissociated neocortical cultures revealed a complete knock down of Mef2c mRNA after 7 days of infection as measured with qRT-PCR (% decrease in Mef2c mRNA after 4 days: 85% and 7 days: >99%). Acute slices containing the barrel cortex were prepared at P18–P25: a period of robust neocortical synapse proliferation (Stern et al., 2001Stern E.A. Maravall M. Svoboda K. Rapid development and plasticity of layer 2/3 maps in rat barrel cortex in vivo.Neuron. 2001; 31: 305-315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Simultaneous whole-cell voltage clamp recordings were performed in Cre-GFP(+); Mef2cfl/fl or “MEF2C KO” neurons and neighboring uninfected, GFP(−); Mef2cfl/fl or wild-type “WT” L2/3 pyramidal neurons (Figures 1A and 1B ). Sparse, postnatal deletion of Mef2c allowed us to determine the cell-autonomous, postsynaptic role of MEF2C on synapse development, while reducing confounds related to the effects Mef2c on migration and laminarization of neocortical neurons (Li et al., 2008Li H. Radford J.C. Ragusa M.J. Shea K.L. McKercher S.R. Zaremba J.D. Soussou W. Nie Z. Kang Y.J. Nakanishi N. et al.Transcription factor MEF2C influences neural stem/progenitor cell differentiation and maturation in vivo.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105: 9397-9402Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). First, we measured spontaneous or miniature (m) EPSCs in TTX to measure the total functional excitatory synaptic inputs onto WT and MEF2C KO neurons. Consistent with a role of Mef2c in synapse elimination, Mef2c deletion robustly increased mEPSC frequency (65%) and amplitude (10%; Figure 1C). A rank-order distribution revealed that mEPSC amplitudes in MEF2C KO neurons are increased by 1.2-fold in comparison to WT, suggesting a general scaling up of synaptic strength (Figure S1A) (Turrigiano, 2011Turrigiano G. Too many cooks? Intrinsic and synaptic homeostatic mechanisms in cortical circuit refinement.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2011; 34: 89-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar) in addition to the increased frequency of mEPSCs. L2/3 pyramidal neurons in the barrel cortex receive the strongest input from L4 axons within the same barrel column (Feldmeyer, 2012Feldmeyer D. Excitatory neuronal connectivity in the barrel cortex.Front. Neuroanat. 2012; 6: 24Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, Shepherd et al., 2003Shepherd G.M. Pologruto T.A. Svoboda K. Circuit analysis of experience-dependent plasticity in the developing rat barrel cortex.Neuron. 2003; 38: 277-289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). To assess evoked excitatory synaptic transmission on MEF2C KO neurons, we electrically stimulated L4 within the same barrel (L4 → L2/3; Figures 1D1 and 1D2). Surprisingly, and in contrast to the observed increase in mEPSCs, evoked L4 → L2/3 EPSCs were strongly decreased (>50%) on MEF2C KO neurons, in comparison to neighboring WT neurons. Short-term plasticity of L4 → L2/3 evoked EPSCs was unaffected in MEF2C KO neurons (Figure 1D3), suggesting the decrease in evoked EPSCs is not due to reduced presynaptic release probability. Heterozygous deletion of Mef2c by expressing AAV-Cre-GFP in Mef2c+/fl mice had no effect on evoked L4 → L2/3 EPSCs, revealing that one allele of Mef2c is sufficient to maintain L4 → L2/3 synaptic transmission (Figure S1B), and that AAV-Cre-GFP expression does not affect EPSCs. Inhibitory synaptic transmission, as measured by evoked and spontaneous mIPSCs, was unaffected in MEF2C KO neurons (Figures S1C and S1D), indicating that Mef2c cell-autonomously and selectively regulates excitatory synaptic transmission. In contrast to Mef2c, deletion of both Mef2a and Mef2d, by injecting AAV-Cre-GFP in MEF2a fl/fl/dfl/fl mice, did not affect the amplitude of evoked L4 → L2/3 EPSCs, short-term plasticity of evoked EPSCs, or mEPSC amplitude, while mEPSC frequency was slightly reduced (Figures S2A and S2B). Deletion of Mef2c or Mef2a/d did not affect input resistance and minimally affected resting membrane potential (Table S1). These results indicate a primary and specific role of Mef2c in development of excitatory neocortical synaptic circuits. To reconcile the opposing effects of Mef2c deletion on mEPSCs and evoked L4 → L2/3 responses, we hypothesized that Mef2c differentially regulates distinct input pathways to L2/3 neurons. To test this possibility, we evoked EPSCs onto WT and MEF2C KO neuron pairs with extracellular electrical stimulation of adjacent L2/3 through which horizontally projecting axons from both local and long-range intercortical pathways pass (Petreanu et al., 2007Petreanu L.

Neurosci. 2007; 10: 663-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar, Petrus et al., 2015Petrus E. Rodriguez G. Patterson R. Connor B. Kanold P.O. Lee H.-K. Vision loss shifts the balance of feedforward and intracortical circuits in opposite directions in mouse primary auditory and visual cortices.J. Neurosci. 2015; 35: 8790-8801Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) (Figure 1E1). In contrast to that observed with stimulation of vertical L4 inputs, EPSCs evoked from adjacent L2/3 were unaffected in MEF2C KO neurons in comparison to neighboring WT neurons (Figures 1E2 and 1E3). This result revealed an input-specific effect of Mef2c deletion. Our data suggest that Mef2c deletion differentially regulates vertical versus horizontal excitatory inputs onto individual L2/3 pyramidal neurons. In the barrel cortex, L2/3 pyramidal neurons receive major input from local synaptic pathways within and across adjacent barrel columns (Feldmeyer, 2012Feldmeyer D. Excitatory neuronal connectivity in the barrel cortex.Front. Neuroanat. 2012; 6: 24Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, Shepherd et al., 2003Shepherd G.M. Pologruto T.A. Svoboda K. Circuit analysis of experience-dependent plasticity in the developing rat barrel cortex.Neuron. 2003; 38: 277-289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). To determine if Mef2c deletion selectively regulates synaptic function from other neocortical input pathways, we performed laser scanning photostimulation (LSPS) to uncage glutamate and map the source and strength of monosynaptic connections from local synaptic input pathways onto simultaneously recorded WT and MEF2C KO L2/3 neurons (Shepherd et al., 2003Shepherd G.M. Pologruto T.A. Svoboda K. Circuit analysis of experience-dependent plasticity in the developing rat barrel cortex.Neuron. 2003; 38: 277-289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). LSPS maps spanned three barrel columns, allowing measurement of synaptic connectivity from different layers onto WT and MEF2C KO L2/3 neurons from the same and adjacent columns. LSPS-evoked EPSCs onto both WT and MEF2C KO neurons were spatially preserved and transformed into a color map where the pixel color represents the mean synaptic strength at each stimulation location (Figures 2A–2C ). Short-latency responses in which glutamate was directly uncaged onto the dendrites of the recorded neurons (i.e., direct responses) were excluded from analysis (black pixels; Figures 2B and 2D). LSPS maps acquired from individual neurons were superimposed by genotype and aligned with respect to the barrels and pia mater. Finally, average maps representing all recorded WT and MEF2C KO L2/3 neurons were constructed (Figure 2D). Vertical and horizontal profiles of synaptic input revealed a weakening of all local intracolumnar and transcolumnar excitatory input pathways onto MEF2C KO L2/3 neurons (Figures 2E and 2F), specifically: vertical L4 → L2/3, adjacent L4 → L2/3, adjacent L2/3 → L2/3, vertical L5A → L2/3, and adjacent L5A → L2/3 (Figures 2G–2K). Therefore, Mef2c promotes the development and function of multiple local excitatory synaptic input pathways onto L2/3 neurons originating from different layers and adjacent columns. LSPS mapping results revealed that all local inputs from adjacent L2/3 onto MEF2C KO neurons are weak (Figure 2I). In contrast, inputs assessed by electrical stimulation of horizontal L2/3 projecting axons were unaffected (Figure 1E), and mEPSCs were enhanced in MEF2C KO neurons (Figure 1C). Therefore, other input pathways onto L2/3 neurons that are not assayed by LSPS may be either unaffected or potentiated by Mef2c deletion. LSPS by glutamate uncaging only probes the strength of local circuits or inputs with an intact cell body and axon in the slice (Shepherd et al., 2003Shepherd G.M. Pologruto T.A. Svoboda K. Circuit analysis of experience-dependent plasticity in the developing rat barrel cortex.Neuron. 2003; 38: 277-289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Axons from long-range input pathways are severed during slice preparation and therefore are not activated by LSPS. Because severed axons from long-range input pathways in the slice reseal and can release glutamate (Petreanu et al., 2007Petreanu L. Huber D. Sobczyk A. Svoboda K. Channelrhodopsin-2-assisted circuit mapping of long-range callosal projections.Nat. Neurosci. 2007; 10: 663-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar), they likely contribute to mEPSCs and electrically evoked EPSCs. We hypothesized that long-range input pathways are potentiated with postsynaptic Mef2c deletion and may contribute to the observed enhancement of mEPSCs. To study effects of Mef2c deletion on long-range intercortical inputs in isolation, we expressed Channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) in axons projecting from the contralateral somatosensory cortex (cS1). These long-range, trans-colossal L2/3 axons project abundantly and provide reliable inputs onto L2/3 pyramidal neurons with connectivity comparable to that from local L2/3 of ipsilateral barrel cortex (Petreanu et al., 2007Petreanu L. Huber D. Sobczyk A. Svoboda K. Channelrhodopsin-2-assisted circuit mapping of long-range callosal projections.Nat. Neurosci. 2007; 10: 663-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar). At P1, the lateral ventricle of Mef2cfl/fl mice was injected with AAV-Cre-GFP, to sparsely delete Mef2c, while AAV-ChR2-mCherry was stereotaxically injected into cS1 (Figure 2L). Slices of barrel cortex contralateral to AAV-ChR2 injection were prepared at P18–P25 and expressed mCherry-positive axons and Cre-GFP+ (MEF2C KO) cell bodies (Figure 2M). EPSCs were evoked by stimulating trans-callosal, ChR2-expressing axons onto pairs of WT and MEF2C KO L2/3 neurons with a brief 2-ms pulse of blue light. To isolate monosynaptic EPSCs from ChR2-expressing axons, experiments were performed in TTX. Remarkably, the amplitude of EPSCs evoked from cS1 inputs was increased by 80% in MEF2C KO neurons compared to WT neurons (Figure 2N), demonstrating potentiation of long-range inputs from cS1. Taken together with results of LSPS experiments (Figures 2D–2K), these data suggest that Mef2c promotes the functional development of local inputs, while suppressing long-range intercortical inputs onto individual L2/3 pyramidal neurons. We sought to determine the synaptic basis of MEF2C regulation at specific input pathways. Mef2c deletion depressed L4 → L2/3 EPSCs, but did not affect short-term synaptic plasticity, suggesting this weakening is mediated by either a selective decrease in AMPA receptor (R) function or synapse number. To differentiate between these possibilities, we measured NMDA-receptor EPSCs onto WT and MEF2C KO L2/3 neurons evoked by electrical stimulation of L4. Like AMPAR-EPSCs, NMDAR-EPSCs were reduced by ∼50% in MEF2C KO neurons (Figure 3A), suggesting a decrease in L4 → L2/3 synapse number. To further test this hypothesis, we measured L4-evoked AMPAR-EPSCs onto WT and MEF2C KO L2/3 neurons in strontium (Sr+2). Sr+2 asynchronizes glutamate release and allows the resolution of quantal synaptic events (Petrus et al., 2015Petrus E. Rodriguez G. Patterson R. Connor B. Kanold P.O. Lee H.-K. Vision loss shifts the balance of feedforward and intracortical circuits in opposite directions in mouse primary auditory and visual cortices.J. Neurosci. 2015; 35: 8790-8801Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Consistent with an effect on synapse number, Mef2c deletion decreased the frequency (∼40%), but not amplitude of L4-evoked quantal events (Figure 3B). In normal ACSF, we measured the coefficient of variance (C.V.) and rate of synaptic failures of L4 → L2/3 EPSCs onto pairs of WT and MEF2C KO neurons. C.V. and failure rate are inversely proportional to release probability and synapse number, and both were strongly increased in MEF2C KO neurons (Figures 3C and 3D) in comparison to WT neurons. Taken together, the changes in NMDAR-EPSCs, Sr+2 event frequency, C.V., and synaptic failures, without changes in short-term plasticity, support a role for MEF2C in promoting the number of functional connections from L4 → L2/3 and possibly all local input pathways. In contrast to L4 → L2/3 evoked EPSCs, the C.V. of EPSCs evoked by blue light stimulation of ChR2-expressing cS1 inputs was unaffected (Figure 3F). This result suggests that the enhanced EPSCs from cS1 inputs on MEF2C KO neurons is likely not due to a change in synapse number or release probability, but may be due to an increase in the strength of individual synapses. Consistent with an increase in the strength of cS1 synaptic inputs, the amplitude of light-evoked quantal events from ChR2-expressing cS1 axons in Sr+2 (Figure 3E1) was enhanced on MEF2C KO in comparison to WT neurons (∼32%; Figure 3E2), and the frequency of events was unchanged. These results, together with the lack of a change in C.V. of cS1-mediated EPSCs, indicate that individual cS1 inputs are strengthened onto MEF2C KO neurons, while connectivity or release probability is not changed (Figure 3E3). The differential regulation of distinct input pathways onto L2/3 neurons by MEF2C may be based on the dendritic compartments contacted by these inputs. Basal dendrites of L2/3 neurons receive local inputs from L4 and L2/3 within barrel columns and from adjacent columns. Proximal apical dendrites also receive local inputs from L2/3. The distal apical “tufts” receive mostly long-range intercortical input from M1, M2, and S2 (Bosman et al., 2011Bosman L.W. Houweling A.R. Owens C.B. Tanke N. Shevchouk O.T. Rahmati N. Teunissen W.H. Ju C. Gong W. Koekkoek S.K. De Zeeuw C.I. Anatomical pathways involved in generating and sensing rhythmic whisker movements.Front. Integr. Neurosci. 2011; 5: 53Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). To determine if Mef2c alters morphology or spines on specific dendritic compartments, WT or MEF2C KO L2/3 neurons were filled with biocytin and processed for imaging. MEF2C KO neurons had normal dendritic branching and length (Figure 3G), but displayed a reduced spine density on basal, but not distal or proximal apical dendrites (Figures 3H and 3I). These findings support functional results that MEF2C KO neurons have fewer synaptic inputs from local (L4) circuits. Sensory deprivation by whisker trimming depresses L4 → L2/3 strength (Shepherd et al., 2003Shepherd G.M. Pologruto T.A. Svoboda K. Circuit analysis of experience-dependent plasticity in the developing rat barrel cortex.Neuron. 2003; 38: 277-289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, Bender et al., 2006Bender K.J. Allen C.B. Bender V.A. Feldman D.E. Synaptic basis for whisker deprivation-induced synaptic depression in rat somatosensory cortex.J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 4155-4165Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), mirroring what we observe with Mef2c deletion (Figure 2). MEF2C and sensory experience may interact in a common signaling pathway to promote synapse development onto L2/3 neurons. If so, then sensory deprivation may occlude or prevent effects of Mef2c deletion on L2/3 synaptic inputs. To test this possibility, we examined the effects of sensory deprivation (whisker trimming) on both local and long-range L2/3 synaptic inputs onto WT and MEF2C KO neurons. To probe the effects of sensory deprivation on local inputs, whiskers of AAV-Cre-GFP-injected Mef2cfl/fl mice were unilaterally trimmed daily from P9–P18 to deprive the contralateral barrel cortex of sensory experience, while the ipsilateral barrel cortex is “spared” and provides a within-animal control (Figure 4A). LSPS maps were obtained simultaneously from WT and MEF2C KO L2/3 neuron pairs in slices from either spared or deprived barrel cortices (Figure 4B). In spared barrel cortex, intracolumnar and transcolumnar L4 → L2/3 synaptic input strengths were reduced onto MEF2C KO, as observed in non-deprived (i.e., non-trimmed; Figures 2D–2F) mice. However, in deprived cortex, L4 synaptic inputs onto MEF2C KO and WT L2/3 neurons were similar and weak like that observed onto MEF2C KO neurons in the spared cortex (Figures 4C–4E). In other words, Mef2c deletion weakened synaptic inputs onto L2/3 neurons in spared, but not deprived, cortex. Thus, a functional interaction between Mef2c and sensory deprivation was observed for vertical L4 → L2/3 inputs (p < 0.05; Figure 4E). This result was not due to strengthening of L4 → L2/3 inputs onto spared WT neurons because they were similar to L4 → L2/3 inputs onto WT neurons in non-deprived mice (Figure S3A). Furthermore, the interaction of Mef2c and experience persists when comparing vertical L4 → L2/3 input onto WT and MEF2C KO neuron pairs between deprived and non-deprived (non-trimmed) barrel cortices (Figure S3B). Similarly, local horizontal L2/3 → L2/3 and vertical L5A → L2/3 inputs (Figures 4F and 4G) were reduced by Mef2c deletion in spared, but not deprived, cortex. These results suggest that MEF2C is required for and permits sensory experience to promote synapse function of local inputs onto neocortical L2/3 pyramidal neurons. To examine the role of sensory experience in Mef2c regulation of long-range inputs from cS1, Mef2cfl/fl mice were injected at P1 with AAV-Cre-GFP and AAV-ChR2-mCherry in cS1 and then subjected to daily unilateral whisker trimming from P9–P18. Light-evoked EPSCs from ChR2-expressing cS1 axons were recorded in WT and MEF2C KO L2/3 neurons in the deprived cortex receiving long-range ChR2-positive inputs from spared cS1 (Figure 4H). In contrast to non-trimmed mice (Figure 2N), cS1-evoked EPSCs in deprived WT and MEF2C KO L2/3 neurons were not different (Figure 4I), indicating that sensory experience is required for Mef2c to suppress long-range cortical inputs onto L2/3 neurons. Here, we demonstrate that postsynaptic Mef2c bidirectionally regulates distinct excitatory synaptic input pathways onto L2/3 pyramidal neurons in the developing barrel cortex in vivo in an experience-dependent manner. Postsynaptic, cell-autonomous deletion of Mef2c decreases functional and structural synaptic connections from local L4 inputs and likely other local input pathways from other layers within and across adjacent columns. In contrast, long-range inputs, from at least contralateral S1, are potentiated. These data suggest that, in response to experience, postsynaptic MEF2C regulates transcripts that differentially affect synaptic connectivity and strength from distinct input pathways (Figure S4). Transcriptional activation of MEF2 family members has been primarily implicated in elimination of excitatory synapses. Embryonic or postnatal brain wide deletion of Mef2c increases spine density and synaptic transmission onto dentate gyrus granule cells of the hippocampus (Adachi et al., 2015Adachi M. Lin P.Y.

USA. 2008; 105: 9391-9396Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), while excitatory synaptic transmission is reduced in CA1 and onto L5 neurons (Barbosa et al., 2008Barbosa A.C. Kim M.S. Ertunc M. Adachi M. Nelson E.D. McAnally J. Richardson J.A. Kavalali E.T. Monteggia L.M. Bassel-Duby R. Olson E.N.

USA. 2008; 105: 9391-9396Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Because embryonic deletion of Mef2c also affects neuronal migration and gross laminarization of neocortex, the cell-autonomous and effects of Mef2c on synapse development and connectivity were unknown (Li et al., 2008Li H. Radford J.C. Ragusa M.J. Shea K.L. McKercher S.R. Zaremba J.D. Soussou W. Nie Z. Kang Y.J. Nakanishi N. et al.Transcription factor MEF2C influences neural stem/progenitor cell differentiation and maturation in vivo.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105: 9397-9402Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). To address this question, we postnatally deleted Mef2c in a sparse population of neurons within a wild-type circuit. Based on the evidence for MEF2C in synapse elimination, the increase in mEPSCs and potentiation of distal inputs in MEF2C KO neurons may be a direct effect of Mef2c deletion, while the depressed local inputs may be a homeostatic response or competition for postsynaptic resources (Bian et al., 2015Bian W.-J. Miao W.-Y. He S.-J. Qiu Z. Yu X. Coordinated spine pruning and maturation mediated by inter-spine competition for cadherin/catenin complexes.Cell. 2015; 162: 808-822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Alternatively, Mef2c may regulate transcripts that promote development or stabilization of synapses targeted by local inputs. In support of this idea, a sumoylated transcriptional repressor form of MEF2A promotes postsynaptic maturation onto cerebellar granule neurons (Shalizi et al., 2006Shalizi A. Gaudillière B. Yuan Z. Stegmüller J. Shirogane T. Ge Q. Tan Y. Schulman B. Harper J.W. Bonni A. A calcium-regulated MEF2 sumoylation switch controls postsynaptic differentiation.Science. 2006; 311: 1012-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). In this scenario, long-range cS1 inputs may homeostatically potentiate as a consequence of weak local, excitatory drive onto MEF2C KO L2/3 neurons. Our data suggest that sensory experience, via regulation by MEF2C, differentially modifies specific L2/3 inputs. Supporting this model, the multiple and diverse effects of sparse postnatal Mef2c deletion on L2/3 circuitry parallel that of sensory deprivation. Whisker trimming decreases the strength of local input pathways onto L2/3 neurons in barrel cortex (Bender et al., 2006Bender K.J. Allen C.B. Bender V.A. Feldman D.E. Synaptic basis for whisker deprivation-induced synaptic depression in rat somatosensory cortex.J.

Circuit analysis of experience-dependent plasticity in the developing rat barrel cortex.Neuron. 2003; 38: 277-289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar) and prevents or occludes weakening by Mef2c deletion. This result suggests that Mef2c is necessary for experience to promote synapse development from local circuits onto L2/3 neurons. Whisker deprivation decreases connectivity between L2/3 neurons, while potentiating mEPSP amplitudes, suggesting differential changes in distinct input pathways (Cheetham et al., 2007Cheetham C.E. Hammond M.S. Edwards C.E. Finnerty G.T. Sensory experience alters cortical connectivity and synaptic function site specifically.J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 3456-3465Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Furthermore, visual deprivation potentiates intercortical inputs onto L2/3, while depressing vertical L4 → L2/3 inputs (Petrus et al., 2015Petrus E. Rodriguez G. Patterson R. Connor B. Kanold P.O. Lee H.-K. Vision loss shifts the balance of feedforward and intracortical circuits in opposite directions in mouse primary auditory and visual cortices.J. Neurosci. 2015; 35: 8790-8801Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). To our knowledge, the effects of sensory deprivation on the strength of interhemispheric excitatory inputs to L2/3 in barrel cortex or other primary sensory cortices have not been examined. MEF2C KO neurons exhibit a selective decrease in structural synapses onto basal dendrites: the primary target of vertical L4 inputs (Feldmeyer et al., 2006Feldmeyer D. Lübke J. Sakmann B. Efficacy and connectivity of intracolumnar pairs of layer 2/3 pyramidal cells in the barrel cortex of juvenile rats.J. Physiol. 2006; 575: 583-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Similarly, sensory experience regulates dendritic spine density onto basal, but not apical L2/3 dendrites (Bian et al., 2015Bian W.-J. Miao W.-Y. He S.-J. Qiu Z. Yu X. Coordinated spine pruning and maturation mediated by inter-spine competition for cadherin/catenin complexes.Cell. 2015; 162: 808-822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, Globus et al., 1973Globus A. Rosenzweig M.R. Bennett E.L. Diamond M.C. Effects of differential experience on dendritic spine counts in rat cerebral cortex.J. Comp. Physiol. Psychol. 1973; 82: 175-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). In contrast to the effects of Mef2c deletion, plucking a single whisker row results in decreased release probability of L4 → L2/3 inputs and no change in mEPSCs onto L2/3 neurons (Bender et al., 2006Bender K.J. Allen C.B. Bender V.A. Feldman D.E. Synaptic basis for whisker deprivation-induced synaptic depression in rat somatosensory cortex.J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 4155-4165Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The synaptic plasticity mechanisms engaged may depend on the deprivation paradigm. Like Mef2c deletion, visual deprivation increases mEPSCs in L2/3 neurons, which correlates with potentiation of evoked synaptic transmission from horizontal inputs and not the depressed vertical L4 → L2/3 inputs (Petrus et al., 2015Petrus E. Rodriguez G. Patterson R. Connor B. Kanold P.O. Lee H.-K. Vision loss shifts the balance of feedforward and intracortical circuits in opposite directions in mouse primary auditory and visual cortices.J. Neurosci. 2015; 35: 8790-8801Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Similarly, we show here that the potentiation of mEPSC frequency and amplitude in MEF2C KO neurons correlates with a strengthening of contralateral S1 inputs, despite a strong depression of all local inputs measured. The fact that EPSCs evoked by extracellular electrical stimulation of horizontally projecting axons in L2/3 were unchanged on MEF2C KO neurons is likely due to stimulation of a mix of axons from both local and long-range input pathways. Although L4 provides the strongest local input onto L2/3 neurons (Shepherd et al., 2003Shepherd G.M. Pologruto T.A. Svoboda K. Circuit analysis of experience-dependent plasticity in the developing rat barrel cortex.Neuron. 2003; 38: 277-289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar) (Figure 2), it is estimated that L4 inputs make up only 5% of the total synapses onto neocortical L2/3 neurons (Douglas and Martin, 2007Douglas R.J. Martin K.A. Mapping the matrix: the ways of neocortex.Neuron. 2007; 56: 226-238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). The enhanced amplitude of quantal events evoked from ChR2-expressing cS1 axons suggests a strengthening of these individual synaptic inputs in this pathway and correlates with the increased mEPSC amplitude. It is unclear why we observe an increase in mEPSC frequency onto L2/3 neurons, but no change in evoked quantal frequency from cS1 axons. The mEPSC frequency changes may stem from enhanced release probability or synapse connectivity of cS1 axons that we cannot detect with the C.V. analysis. Alternatively, enhanced release probability or synaptic connections from other long-range input pathways we did not measure, such as ipsilateral S2, M1, M2, or thalamus (Feldmeyer, 2012Feldmeyer D. Excitatory neuronal connectivity in the barrel cortex.Front. Neuroanat. 2012; 6: 24Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) could underlie the increased mEPSC frequency. Furthermore, we cannot rule out the possibility that MEF2C differentially regulates evoked and spontaneous synaptic transmission from the same local or long-range inputs (Kavalali, 2015Kavalali E.T. The mechanisms and functions of spontaneous neurotransmitter release.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2015; 16: 5-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Transcription factors control development of axons and dendrites, as well as formation of layer-specific synaptic inputs in part via production of gradients of guidance cues (Santiago and Bashaw, 2014Santiago C. Bashaw G.J. Transcription factors and effectors that regulate neuronal morphology.Development. 2014; 141: 4667-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Here, we demonstrate that a postsynaptic transcription factor differentially regulates distinct synaptic inputs onto an individual cortical neuron without affecting dendritic morphology. The activity-regulated transcription factor, NPAS4, differentially regulates strength of inhibitory synaptic inputs impinging on different dendritic domains of CA1 pyramidal neurons in an experience-dependent manner (Bloodgood et al., 2013Bloodgood B.L. Sharma N. Browne H.A. Trepman A.Z. Greenberg M.E. The activity-dependent transcription factor NPAS4 regulates domain-specific inhibition.Nature. 2013; 503: 121-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Thus, experience and activity may determine the connectivity and strength of specific inhibitory and excitatory circuits, respectively, via coordinated regulation of NPAS4 and MEF2C. Dendritic spine densities were reduced on basal, but not apical dendrites of MEF2C KO neurons, suggesting that MEF2C may differentially regulate inputs based on dendritic compartment. Although L4 and local L2/3 inputs synapse onto basal dendrites of L2/3 neurons, local L2/3 inputs also contact proximal apical dendrites (Feldmeyer et al., 2006Feldmeyer D. Lübke J. Sakmann B. Efficacy and connectivity of intracolumnar pairs of layer 2/3 pyramidal cells in the barrel cortex of juvenile rats.J. Physiol. 2006; 575: 583-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), where we did not detect a change in spines. In this scenario, one would expect that inputs from cS1 to primarily contact apical dendrites of L2/3 neurons in barrel cortex, which to our knowledge, is unknown. Alternatively, the origin of the presynaptic input, local versus long-range, may determine regulation by postsynaptic MEF2C. MEF2 transcription factors regulate cell adhesion molecules, such as protocadherins and semaphorins, which may stabilize or eliminate specific input pathways through trans-synaptic interactions (Flavell et al., 2008Flavell S.W. Kim T.-K. Gray J.M. Harmin D.A. Hemberg M. Hong E.J. Markenscoff-Papadimitriou E. Bear D.M. Greenberg M.E.

Interestingly, imbalances in local versus long-range functional connectivity among cortical and other regions are associated with autism and perhaps schizophrenia (Cao et al., 2016Cao H. Dixson L.

https://openalex.org/W2563555800,"Peripheral neuronal activation by inflammatory mediators is a multifaceted physiological response that involves a multitude of regulated cellular functions. One key pathway that has been shown to be involved in inflammatory pain is Gq/GPCR, whose activation by inflammatory mediators is followed by the regulated response of the cation channel transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1). However, the mechanism that underlies TRPV1 activation downstream of the Gq/GPCR pathway has yet to be fully defined. In this study, we employ pharmacological and molecular biology tools to dissect this activation mechanism via perforated-patch recordings and calcium imaging of both neurons and a heterologous system. We showed that TRPV1 activity downstream of Gq/GPCR activation only produced a subdued current, which was noticeably different from the robust current that is typical of TRPV1 activation by exogenous stimuli. Moreover, we specifically demonstrated that 2 pathways downstream of Gq/GPCR signaling, namely endovanilloid production by lipoxygenases and channel phosphorylation by PKC, converge on TRPV1 to evoke a tightly regulated response. Of importance, we show that only when both pathways are acting on TRPV1 is the inflammatory-mediated response achieved. We propose that the requirement of multiple signaling events allows subdued TRPV1 activation to evoke regulated neuronal response during inflammation.—Kumar R., Hazan, A., Geron, M., Steinberg, R., Livni, L., Matzner, H., Priel, A.

Eye movements generated by simple brainstem circuits provide a means for relating cellular plasticity to behavioral gain control. Here we show that firing rate potentiation, a form of intrinsic plasticity mediated by reductions in BK-type calcium-activated potassium currents in spontaneously firing neurons, is engaged during optokinetic reflex compensation for inner ear dysfunction.

Activity-dependent regulation of intrinsic excitability may be a general mechanism for adaptive control of behavioral output in multisensory circuits. Neural circuit function depends both on synaptic connectivity and on the concerted action of ion channels that are regulated by neuronal activity. Increasing evidence implicates plasticity of ion channel function in experience-dependent changes in the developing and mature nervous systems (Turrigiano, 2011Turrigiano G. Too many cooks?

Neurosci. 2011; 34: 89-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar, Mozzachiodi and Byrne, 2010Mozzachiodi R. Byrne J.H. More than synaptic plasticity: role of nonsynaptic plasticity in learning and memory.Trends Neurosci. 2010; 33: 17-26Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Several forms of learning and memory, including associative, trace, delay, and fear conditioning, have been associated with changes in intrinsic excitability and associated ionic currents in neurons of the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, or amygdala. Making direct connections between plasticity of intrinsic excitability and cognitive forms of behavioral learning in vivo has been hampered, however, by the complexities of neural circuits in the forebrain, in which neuronal activity is indirectly related to behavioral output. Eye movements that stabilize images on the retina provide a tractable system for linking cellular mechanisms with behavioral outcomes (Gittis and du Lac, 2006Gittis A.H. du Lac S. Intrinsic and synaptic plasticity in the vestibular system.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2006; 16: 385-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, Kodama and du Lac, 2016Kodama T. du Lac S. Adaptive acceleration of visually evoked smooth eye movements in mice.J. Neurosci. 2016; 36: 6836-6849Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Experience-dependent changes in eye movements occur throughout life, and the role of neuronal firing in eye movement performance and plasticity has been studied intensively over several decades. During self-motion, retinal image motion is minimized via compensatory eye movements mediated by defined neural circuits in the cerebellum and brainstem. Brainstem medial vestibular nucleus (MVN) neurons transform presynaptic signals encoding head movements and image motion into postsynaptic modulations of firing rate that are appropriate for generating adaptive eye movements. Cerebellum-dependent motor learning in the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) produces dramatic changes in the firing responses of MVN neurons (Lisberger, 1988Lisberger S.G.

Reconsidering the role of neuronal intrinsic properties and neuromodulation in vestibular homeostasis.Front. Neurol. 2012; 28: 3-25Google Scholar). An intriguing candidate cellular mechanism of plasticity in the oculomotor system is firing rate potentiation (FRP), in which repeated inhibition of tonically firing neurons results in long-lasting increases in intrinsic excitability via CaMKII-dependent reductions in BK calcium-activated potassium currents (Nelson et al., 2003Nelson A.B.

Neurosci. 2013; 33: 5895-5902Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). MVN neurons fire spontaneously at high rates in vivo; their firing derives from a combination of strong excitatory drive from spontaneously firing vestibular nerve afferents, synaptic inhibition from cerebellar Purkinje cells and local circuit neurons, and intrinsic pacemaking currents (Lin and Carpenter, 1993Lin Y. Carpenter D.O. Medial vestibular neurons are endogenous pacemakers whose discharge is modulated by neurotransmitters.Cell. Mol.

Firing properties of GABAergic versus non-GABAergic vestibular nucleus neurons conferred by a differential balance of potassium currents.J. Neurophysiol. 2007; 97: 3986-3996Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that after peripheral vestibular dysfunction, when excitatory synaptic drive to MVN neurons is decreased, ongoing synaptic inhibition could trigger a reduction in BK currents via firing rate potentiation. The subsequent increases in MVN neuronal excitability would amplify remaining inputs and enable intact sensory signals to substitute for the loss of vestibular self-motion information. To determine whether FRP is critical for oculomotor plasticity, we performed behavioral and electrophysiological analyses in mice subjected to unilateral vestibular deafferentation (UVD), the vestibular equivalent of monocular deprivation. Eye movements, MVN neuronal excitability, and the capacity to induce FRP were assessed in parallel after UVD to establish the temporal relationship of intrinsic and oculomotor plasticity. Our findings demonstrate that vestibular loss induces robust increases in MVN neuronal excitability, occlusion of FRP, and reduction of BK currents, concomitant with rapid visuomotor plasticity (increases in the gain of the optokinetic reflex), which compensates for impaired vestibular function. A critical role for activity-dependent regulation of BK currents in multisensory oculomotor plasticity was confirmed by the normal oculomotor performance but complete absence of optokinetic reflex plasticity in mice with global deletion of BK channels. During self-motion, the stability of images on the retina is maintained by two complementary reflexes: the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR), which is driven by head movements, and the optokinetic reflex (OKR), which is driven by image motion. In mice, as in other species, these oculomotor reflexes are differentially optimized for fast and slow motion, respectively, and their conjoint operation ensures excellent gaze stability (Stahl, 2004Stahl J.S. Using eye movements to assess brain function in mice.Vision Res. 2004; 44: 3401-3410Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, Faulstich et al., 2004Faulstich B.M. Onori K.A. du Lac S. Comparison of plasticity and development of mouse optokinetic and vestibulo-ocular reflexes suggests differential gain control mechanisms.Vision Res. 2004; 44: 3419-3427Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). As demonstrated in Figure 1A, juvenile mice (p21–p26) rotated on a turntable (1 Hz ± 5 deg) around a stationary patterned visual stimulus produced eye movements with gains (eye speed/stimulus speed) that approached unity (i.e., perfect compensation). In contrast, the same rotation in darkness evoked a VOR that compensated for about 80% of head motion (gain = 0.8; Figure 1B). The corresponding OKR, elicited by rotation of a striped drum when mice were stationary, compensated for 20%–30% of image motion (OKR gains 0.2–0.3; Figure 1C). Thus, under behaviorally relevant conditions, eye movements are optimized by combining sensory signals originating in both the inner ear and the retina. Loss of inner ear function (unilateral vestibular deprivation, or UVD; see Experimental Procedures) triggered dynamic changes in eye movement performance. 8 hr after UVD, eye movements evoked by rotation of mice in the presence of visual stimuli were reduced significantly (Figure 1A; gain: 0.68 ± 0.05, p < 0.001). Remarkably, within 24 hr of UVD, eye movement gain increased rapidly, to 0.83 ± 0.05. Within 3 weeks, eye movements evoked by rotation in the light had fully compensated for the loss of vestibular function (Figure 1A). In control experiments, sham manipulations had no effect on eye movements (Figure 1A), demonstrating that disruption of vestibular function drives plastic changes in eye movements. Adaptive changes in both the VOR and OKR contributed to the oculomotor plasticity induced by UVD. When measured in darkness, VOR gain dropped to 42% of pre-operative values 8 hr after UVD (Figure 1B; p < 0.0001). Compensatory increases in the VOR were evident within 3 days of UVD, and performance continued to improve gradually, with VOR gain reaching 80% of control values within 3 weeks. These effects on VOR performance depended on loss of vestibular function, as evidenced by the relative constancy of VOR gain in sham-operated mice (Figure 1B). Notably, unilateral vestibular loss triggered rapid adaptive plasticity in the OKR (Figure 1C). OKR gain increased within 8 hr of UVD and was 2-fold higher than control within 24 hr (p < 0.0001). Thereafter, OKR gain declined to a steady-state level that did not differ significantly from control. Sham-operated mice evaluated in parallel showed no change in OKR gain. These results indicate that in juvenile mice, as in adult mice (Faulstich et al., 2004Faulstich B.M. Onori K.A. du Lac S. Comparison of plasticity and development of mouse optokinetic and vestibulo-ocular reflexes suggests differential gain control mechanisms.Vision Res. 2004; 44: 3419-3427Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and primates (Fetter and Zee, 1988Fetter M. Zee D.S. Recovery from unilateral labyrinthectomy in rhesus monkey.J. Neurophysiol. 1988; 59: 370-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), the oculomotor system exhibits adaptive, multisensory plasticity in which increases in visually driven eye movements compensate for loss of vestibular function. To investigate whether experience-dependent changes in intrinsic neuronal excitability could account for the multisensory plasticity induced by UVD, medial vestibular nucleus (MVN) neurons were targeted for electrophysiological recordings in brainstem slices obtained from mice subjected to UVD and sham manipulations. To control for sampling biases and variability in tissue quality, neurons from both experimental and control mice were recorded by each of three investigators working in parallel. Excitability was assessed 8 hr, 1 day, 3 days, 7 days, and 21 days after UVD. For each time point and condition, recordings were made from an average of 115 neurons (range 64–161). Experiments and analyses were performed blinded to the behavioral manipulation. In slices from sham-operated mice, 55%–70% of MVN neurons recorded with whole-cell patch pipettes fired spontaneously, typically at rates between 10 and 15 spikes/s. UVD altered the proportion of spontaneously firing neurons but had no effect on the average rates of neurons that fired spontaneously (Figure S1). The proportion of neurons firing spontaneously was reduced 8 hr after UVD (p < 0.05) and was unaffected at subsequent time points. Spontaneous firing rates were not affected by UVD at any time point. To control for the possibility that changes in firing rates were masked by intracellular dialysis in the whole-cell recording configuration, extracellular electrodes were used to measure spontaneous firing rates. UVD had no effect on firing rates obtained with extracellular electrodes at any time point (p > 0.25, n > 20 neurons for each condition). To provide appropriate drive to motoneurons, spike generator mechanisms in MVN neurons must transform synaptic signals into well-calibrated modulations in firing rate. We asked whether UVD altered the sensitivity of spike generation by assessing firing responses to intracellular current injection. When MVN neurons are depolarized, they respond with proportional increases in firing rate up to several hundred Hz (Serafin et al., 1991Serafin M. de Waele C. Khateb A. Vidal P.P. Mühlethaler M.

Physiological and anatomical properties of mouse medial vestibular nucleus neurons projecting to the oculomotor nucleus.J. Neurophysiol. 2006; 95: 3012-3023Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The gain of intrinsic excitability (quantified as the slope of the firing rate to current relationship) is constant across the firing range or tends to exhibit two values with an inflection at evoked firing rates of 80 Hz (Bagnall et al., 2007Bagnall M.W. Stevens R.J. du Lac S. Transgenic mouse lines subdivide medial vestibular nucleus neurons into discrete, neurochemically distinct populations.J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 2318-2330Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Figure 2A plots mean firing rates evoked during 1 s of intracellular current injection versus stimulus amplitude for representative MVN neurons recorded 24 hr after UVD and sham operations. The gain of the neuron recorded after UVD was higher than the control neuron’s gain at firing ranges both below and above 80 Hz. These results are quantified for the population of recorded neurons in Figures 2B and 2C. 8 hr after UVD, neuronal gains did not differ between groups. In contrast, at the 24 hr time point, gains in UVD neurons were significantly higher than those in sham neurons (low range: p < 0.05, n = 134 UVD, n = 146 sham; high range: p < 0.005, n = 131 UVD, n = 142 sham). Over the next 3 weeks, neurons recorded after UVD had gains that were slightly but not significantly higher than controls (Figures 2B and 2C). Transient increases in neuronal excitability were also evident in response to temporally modulated stimuli (Figure 3), which approximate the pattern of vestibular stimulation that a mouse would experience during head rotations. Sinusoidal modulation of input current evoked sinusoidal modulations in firing rate that were larger in neurons recorded 24 hr after UVD than in control neurons (Figure 3A). Sinusoidal gains were on average 25% higher 24 hr after UVD at all frequencies tested (Figure 3B) but did not differ from control at any other time point (Figure 3C; p < 0.05). Other measures of intrinsic physiological properties were not affected by UVD, including maximum firing rates, spike frequency adaptation, input resistance, action potential width, postinhibitory rebound firing, and action potential after hyperpolarization (Table S1). These data indicate that UVD is accompanied by transient increases in intrinsic excitability that are evident within 24 hr and are restored to control values within 3 days. Synaptic inhibition or membrane hyperpolarization of MVN neurons triggers long-lasting increases in intrinsic excitability via a process termed “firing rate potentiation” (Nelson et al., 2003Nelson A.B.

After 5 min of membrane hyperpolarization with current pulses (see Experimental Procedures), the neuron’s spontaneous firing rate increased to 23 spikes/s (Figure 4A). Concomitantly, firing response gain increased by 13% (Figure 4B). The increases in excitability were sustained beyond the 30 min duration of the recording displayed. As we hypothesized that firing rate potentiation might be utilized in vivo to mediate behavioral plasticity, we next tested whether it could still be induced in slices from mice subjected to UVD at various points during vestibular compensation. Consistent with this hypothesis, we found that UVD transiently occluded firing rate potentiation. Figure 4C shows spontaneous firing rates prior to and after 5 min of membrane hyperpolarization for a population of neurons recorded from sham and UVD slices 1 day after surgery. Although sham neurons demonstrated robust firing rate potentiation (146% ± 9%, n = 8, p < 0.01), UVD neurons exhibited no change in firing rate (92% ± 7%, n = 8). Similarly, as shown in Figure 4D, firing response gains did not increase after UVD (104% ± 2%, n = 15) but did so robustly after sham surgery (126% ± 3%, n = 16, p < 0.005). Together, these results demonstrate that 1 day after vestibular deprivation, firing rate potentiation or its constituent cellular mechanisms are occluded. Figure 5 summarizes the effects of the firing rate potentiation induction protocol on excitability assessed at different time points after UVD. Potentiation of spontaneous firing was occluded 8 hr and 1 day after UVD (p = 0.006 and 0.0048, respectively) but not at later times (Figure 5A). Potentiation of firing response gain was occluded 1 day and 3 days after UVD (p = 0.0002 and 0.014, respectively) but was robust at later time points (Figure 5B). These results indicate that loss of vestibular drive to central neurons transiently disrupts the signaling pathways that mediate firing rate potentiation. The concurrence of increased excitability and occlusion of firing rate potentiation suggests the possibility that UVD triggers firing rate potentiation, with consequent increases in excitability, leading to improved oculomotor performance. It is possible, however, that UVD affects excitability via signaling pathways distinct from those critical for firing rate potentiation. The downstream consequence of the reduced [Ca2+] and CaMKII levels that trigger FRP is a marked reduction of BK currents (Nelson et al., 2005Nelson A.B. Gittis A.H. du Lac S.

Bidirectional control of BK channel open probability by CAMKII and PKC in medial vestibular nucleus neurons.J. Neurophysiol. 2011; 105: 1651-1659Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). To determine whether BK channels are affected by UVD, we assessed the actions of the specific BK channel antagonist iberiotoxin (IBTX) on MVN neuronal excitability, as described previously (Nelson et al., 2005Nelson A.B. Gittis A.H. du Lac S. Decreases in CaMKII activity trigger persistent potentiation of intrinsic excitability in spontaneously firing vestibular nucleus neurons.Neuron. 2005; 46: 623-631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Application of IBTX (150 nM) to control slices resulted in a gradual increase in spontaneous firing rate and firing response gain, as shown in a representative neuron, which more than doubled its firing rate (Figure 6A), increased its gain by 26% (Figure 6B), and decreased the amplitude of the afterhyperpolarization (AHP) by 4.6 mV after BK channel blockade. Notably, IBTX had significantly less effect on excitability in slices obtained 1 day after UVD (Figures 6C and 6D; n = 6, p < 0.05 for firing rate and gain), and the AHP was reduced less by IBTX in UVD versus sham (2.4 ± 0.52 versus 4.3 ± 0.82 mV, respectively, p < 0.05). No differences in the effects of IBTX were observed in sham slices versus lesion slices at other time points (data not shown). These findings support a model in which loss of vestibular function triggers transient increases in excitability via decreases in BK currents. The results presented thus far suggest that reduction in BK currents in MVN neurons contributes to oculomotor plasticity after UVD. To test directly whether oculomotor plasticity depends on BK channels, we examined oculomotor performance prior to and after UVD in mice with a genetic deletion of BK channels (Meredith et al., 2004Meredith A.L. Thorneloe K.S. Werner M.E. Nelson M.T. Aldrich R.W. Overactive bladder and incontinence in the absence of the BK large conductance Ca2+-activated K+ channel.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 36746-36752Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Eye movements induced by either vestibular or optokinetic stimulation alone or in combination were similar in BK-null mice and wild-type littermates (Figures 7 and S2), indicating that BK channels are not required for normal oculomotor performance. In contrast, oculomotor plasticity induced by UVD was impaired in BK-null mice (Figure 7). Eye movements evoked by rotation in the light were significantly smaller 8 hr after UVD in BK-null than in WT control mice (p < 0.001). Oculomotor gains in BK-null mice remained depressed to less than half of control values for the subsequent 3 days. Within a week of UVD, eye movements induced by rotation in the light were indistinguishable in BK-null and wild-type mice (Figure 7A). VOR gains measured in darkness were more severely affected by UVD in BK-null mice than in wild-type littermates (Figure 7B); 8 hr after UVD, VOR gain dropped by 80% ± 3% in BK-null mice versus 60% ± 1% in controls (p < 0.005, n = 5 each). VOR gain remained lower in BK-null mice than in controls for 3 days and then gradually increased to attain wild-type values. Remarkably, BK-null mice exhibited no OKR plasticity at any time point (Figure 7C), whereas control mice exhibited robust increases in OKR gain 24 hr after UVD (p < 0.005). These results demonstrate that BK channels are required for adaptive visuomotor plasticity after loss of peripheral vestibular inputs. The data presented here demonstrate a behavioral role for firing rate potentiation, a form of intrinsic plasticity in spontaneously firing neurons in which persistent hyperpolarization triggers increases in intrinsic excitability via reductions in BK-type calcium-activated potassium currents. In mice subjected to unilateral vestibular deprivation, impairments in gaze-stabilizing eye movements are rapidly compensated by adaptive increases in visuomotor drive, as quantified by the gain of the optokinetic reflex. This multisensory behavioral plasticity occurs concomitantly with potentiation of intrinsic excitability in vestibular nucleus neurons. Occlusion of hyperpolarization-induced intrinsic plasticity and reduction of BK currents indicates a mechanistic role for activity-dependent regulation of BK channels via firing rate potentiation. Consistent with this model, mice with genetic ablation of BK channels exhibit profound impairments in eye movement performance and complete loss of optokinetic reflex plasticity after vestibular deprivation. These findings indicate that experience-dependent plasticity of intrinsic excitability via reductions in BK currents contributes to adaptive reweighting of sensory signals that drive eye movements. Eye movement control systems require computations of self-motion derived from several sensory systems acting in concert, including the vestibular, visual, and proprioceptive systems (Angelaki and Cullen, 2008Angelaki D.E.

Rapid increases in OKR gain during the initial period of impaired vestibular function represent a form of sensory substitution (Brandt et al., 1997Brandt T. Strupp M. Arbusow V. Dieringer N.

MVN neurons represent a key site of convergence of self-motion signals and are essential for the performance and the adaptive plasticity of smooth eye movements (Broussard and Kassardjian, 2004Broussard D.M.

Despite more than a century of use in clinical practice, the prototypic binding site for this class of drugs within pLGICs is yet to be described. In this study, we present the first X-ray structures of barbiturates bound to GLIC, a cationic prokaryotic pLGIC with excellent structural homology to other relevant channels sensitive to general anesthetics and, as shown here, to barbiturates, at clinically relevant concentrations. Several derivatives of barbiturates containing anomalous scatterers were synthesized, and these derivatives helped us unambiguously identify a unique barbiturate binding site within the central ion channel pore in a closed conformation. In addition, docking calculations around the observed binding site for all three states of the receptor, including a model of the desensitized state, showed that barbiturates preferentially stabilize the closed state. The identification of this pore binding site sheds light on the mechanism of barbiturate inhibition of cationic pLGICs and allows the rationalization of several structural and functional features previously observed for barbiturates."

It has become increasingly appreciated that neural functions need to be understood in terms of neuronal populations and the dynamics of the circuits to which they belong (Miller and Wilson, 2008Miller E.K.

However, the field of systems neuroscience in nonhuman primates has traditionally been dominated by studies of the properties of single neurons. While we have a wealth of knowledge of single-neuron behaviors in many areas of the primate brain, this knowledge remains largely phenomenological—we know what neurons do, but not how they do it. Especially on the circuit level, the mechanisms and connectivity underlying neuronal behaviors are often obscure. Such is the case in the lateral intraparietal area (LIP), where a large body of literature has revealed that the activity of single neurons encodes visual attention and saccadic eye movements, as well as decision making variables, abstract categories, and other cognitive variables (Bisley and Goldberg, 2010Bisley J.W.

However, little is known about the circuitry inside or outside the LIP network that produces such activity, and therefore the role of LIP in many of these functions is controversial. A step in understanding this circuitry was taken by Ganguli et al., 2008Ganguli S. Bisley J.W. Roitman J.D. Shadlen M.N. Goldberg M.E. Miller K.D. One-dimensional dynamics of attention and decision making in LIP.Neuron. 2008; 58: 15-25Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, who analyzed LIP network dynamics during two different tasks: a delayed saccade task (Bisley and Goldberg, 2003Bisley J.W.

They found that the dynamics of the high-dimensional LIP network are dominated by one multi-neuronal dimension on slow timescales, which could be explained by a simple circuit model. This one-dimensionality was key to explaining an unexpected correspondence between LIP single-neuron responses and the timing of attentional shifts (examined in more detail below).

Neurosci. 2011; 31: 10627-10639Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), i.e., stimuli outside the receptive field (RF) of a cell suppress the cell’s activity. In the FK study, the population-averaged activity over time is very similar to that in the BG study, as expected given the very similar tasks. However, we find that the pattern of activity across neurons changes over time in a very different way in the FK study. In particular, the network dynamics in the FK dataset markedly deviate from the one-dimensional dynamics observed in the BG dataset, calling into question the validity of the one-dimensional LIP model of Ganguli et al. We show that the two sets of conflicting results can be reconciled and well characterized by a more general low-dimensional model: each of two local LIP networks in isolation has its own single dominant dimension, and suppressive coupling between them gives rise to two dominant dimensions. We further show that the FK data directly confirm the two-dimensional dynamics predicted by the model. Our study thus represents a step forward in discovering circuit mechanisms and connectivity from single-neuron recordings, and in understanding mechanisms behind LIP functions. We begin by describing the first of the two conflicting datasets (Bisley and Goldberg, 2003Bisley J.W. Goldberg M.E. Neuronal activity in the lateral intraparietal area and spatial attention.Science. 2003; 299: 81-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar), along with the one-dimensional model (Ganguli et al., 2008Ganguli S. Bisley J.W. Roitman J.D. Shadlen M.N. Goldberg M.E. Miller K.D. One-dimensional dynamics of attention and decision making in LIP.Neuron. 2008; 58: 15-25Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) to which it gave rise. The delayed-saccade task of BG is illustrated in Figure 1A (details in Supplemental Information [SI] section 1, available online). During this task, LIP neurons exhibit a large transient visual response to the onset of a saccade target or distractor in the RF, and sustained delay period activity (delay activity) when a saccade is planned to the RF (Figure 1C). When a distractor is flashed away from the target location during the delay period, attention is transiently attracted away from the target location to the distractor location. At the same time, the average visual response level of LIP neurons whose RFs contain the distractor location (the distractor population) rises above the average delay activity level of neurons whose RFs contain the target location (the target population). As the visual activity of the distractor population decays back to baseline, the locus of attention shifts back to the target location. This shift in attention coincides with the shift in the peak of LIP activity from the distractor population to the target population: when the decaying visual activity of the distractor population drops to a level statistically indistinguishable from the sustained delay activity of the target population (the “crossing time”—when the decaying red trace crosses the blue trace in Figure 1C), neither the target nor the distractor location has attentional advantage, whereas 100–250 ms before or after this crossing time, the distractor or target location, respectively, is the clear locus of attention. Further analyses of these results (Bisley and Goldberg, 2006Bisley J.W. Goldberg M.E. Neural correlates of attention and distractibility in the lateral intraparietal area.J. Neurophysiol. 2006; 95: 1696-1717Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) revealed that this correspondence between activity crossing and attentional switching also held at the level of single LIP neurons. The crossing time of a single neuron is defined as the time at which the neuron’s decaying response to a distractor, on trials in which a distractor is in its RF (distractor trials), crosses its own level of delay activity on trials in which a target is in its RF (target trials). These single-neuron crossing times are surprisingly invariant across neurons and closely aligned with the monkey’s attentional switching time, despite high variability across neurons in their peak visual responses, time constants of visual response decay, and delay period responses. Ganguli et al., 2008Ganguli S. Bisley J.W. Roitman J.D. Shadlen M.N. Goldberg M.E. Miller K.D. One-dimensional dynamics of attention and decision making in LIP.Neuron. 2008; 58: 15-25Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar explained this observation with the proposal that the dynamics of a local network (LN) of LIP neurons are dominated on slow timescales by one multi-neuronal activity pattern (i.e., a pattern, or vector, of relative firing rates across the cells of the network). Throughout this paper, we use the term “local network” (or LN) to mean a network of LIP neurons that share the same RF (explained more fully in the section “Simple model of coupled local networks reconciles the results”). Ganguli et al. proposed that the recurrent connectivity of an LN causes certain multi-neuronal activity patterns to persist longer in the absence of input; given steady input, these slowly decaying patterns also build up to be strongly amplified. If the network has only a single pattern that decays slowly, we refer to it as the network’s “slow mode,” where “mode” is a term borrowed from physics that describes a characteristic pattern of a system’s response. As the visual response to a distractor decays, it becomes dominated by this slow mode after all other patterns decay away. Because the slow mode is more strongly amplified than other patterns, it also dominates steady-state responses, such as delay activity and activity during the initial fixation before target onset (fixation activity). Thus, after the other patterns in the distractor response decay away, the decaying distractor activity and the ongoing delay activity are both dominated by the slow mode, meaning that the pattern of distractor activity across neurons is very nearly a scaled-up version of the delay activity pattern. Then as the distractor activity decays further, it becomes very nearly identical to the delay activity pattern, which happens at the crossing time. Thus, each individual neuron has roughly the same activity in its delay response as in its distractor response at the crossing time, so that all neurons have about the same single-neuron crossing time. This one-dimensional model predicts that multi-neuronal activity patterns that change on slow timescales are all highly correlated with one another because all are dominated by the same strongly amplified pattern. These include fixation and delay activity patterns and, to a lesser extent, slowly decaying visual activity patterns and slowly increasing activity patterns during decision-making tasks. On the other hand, during the initial transient visual response, many other activity patterns are activated, so the transient visual activity pattern is not highly correlated with the steady-state activity patterns. Ganguli et al., 2008Ganguli S. Bisley J.W. Roitman J.D. Shadlen M.N. Goldberg M.E. Miller K.D. One-dimensional dynamics of attention and decision making in LIP.Neuron. 2008; 58: 15-25Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar confirmed these predictions using the following analysis, which reveals network dynamics from the activity of a population of singly recorded neurons. At any millisecond time point t, we represent the trial-averaged activity of a population of N neurons as an N-dimensional vector, r→(t), in an N-dimensional multi-neuronal firing rate space; each of the N elements of r→(t) is the activity of one neuron at time t, averaged over trials. We also compute the N-dimensional fixation activity vector, F→, where each element is the activity of one neuron averaged over the fixation period before target onset and over target trials. Then, at each time point t over the course of the trial, a correlation coefficient is computed between F→ and r→(t). Figure 1E shows that the correlation to fixation activity is indeed high for delay activity or distractor activity after the transient visual response decays away, indicating that fixation, delay, and post-transient distractor activity patterns all lie roughly in a single dimension, corresponding to the dominant activity pattern. The drop in correlation coefficient during the visual response indicates the transient deviation of activity from this one dimension caused by the transient activation of other non-dominant patterns. We continue by describing the second of the two conflicting datasets (Falkner et al., 2010Falkner A.L. Krishna B.S. Goldberg M.E. Surround suppression sharpens the priority map in the lateral intraparietal area.J.

The task of FK (Figure 1B) is very similar to that of BG. For both tasks, we analyze data in each trial during time windows ending shortly after distractor onset (i.e., before the onset of the probe in the BG task; see Figure 1A), up to which point the two tasks are virtually identical aside from three differences. First, BG used a flashed target while FK presented a target that stayed visible during the delay. This does not result in qualitatively different delay activity levels (compare delay activity between Figures 1C and 1D), consistent with LIP encoding the attentional and saccadic priority of the target location regardless of the visibility of the target. Second, BG randomly interleaved target trials and distractor trials, while FK presented target and distractor trials in blocks. Thus, in the FK experiment, on almost every trial the monkey had an expectation of where the target and distractor would be. This is reflected in higher anticipatory firing on target trials compared to distractor trials during the fixation period before target onset. The third difference is likely to be the key difference that led to different neural responses observed during the two tasks. In the BG task, the target and distractor are in opposite visual quadrants and equidistant from the fixation spot. In the FK task, in contrast, either the target or the distractor is in the RF of the cell being recorded in a given session, and the other stimulus is at the location eliciting maximum surround suppression of the recorded neuron. With this placement of stimuli, a saccade plan to the surround significantly suppressed the visual response to the distractor, while distractor appearance in the surround transiently and weakly, but significantly, suppressed delay activity during saccade planning (Figure 1D; quantified in Falkner et al., 2010Falkner A.L. Krishna B.S. Goldberg M.E. Surround suppression sharpens the priority map in the lateral intraparietal area.J. Neurosci. 2010; 30: 12787-12797Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Surround suppression was not observed in the BG dataset (quantified in Bisley and Goldberg, 2006Bisley J.W. Goldberg M.E. Neural correlates of attention and distractibility in the lateral intraparietal area.J. Neurophysiol. 2006; 95: 1696-1717Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), in which the stimulus locations were not selected for suppression. Other than the surround suppression of response amplitudes, the FK dataset displays the same overall pattern of fixation, visual, and delay activity as the BG dataset (compare Figures 1C and 1D). However, beneath this apparent similarity in population average activity, the network dynamics are radically different; moreover, the FK dynamics appear to clearly violate the predictions of the one-dimensional model. Figure 1F shows the result of the correlation analysis on the FK data. Most strikingly, on distractor trials (red trace), even though the appearance of the target in the surround only minimally affects the mean firing rate of the population, target appearance causes a large, sustained drop in correlation, when the one-dimensional model would predict an unchanging and high level of correlation, as in Figure 1E. This indicates that the activity pattern of the population has changed dramatically while its mean firing rate has remained about the same. Furthermore, the later appearance of the distractor in the RF causes a large, transient rise in correlation that subsequently returns to the steady low level present before distractor onset, when the one-dimensional model would predict the opposite change—a large and transient drop in correlation upon distractor onset, as in Figure 1E. In target trials (blue traces), the difference is more subtle, with target onset evoking a small, sustained drop in correlation, similar to the sustained drop in the BG case, but without the initially larger transient decrease. Note that in the BG dataset, the two trial types are randomly interleaved; thus, the monkey does not know the trial type during the initial fixation, and fixation activities are the same in the two trial types. In the FK dataset, however, fixation activities are different on the two trial types due to the block design. We chose to use the fixation activity on target trials as opposed to distractor trials to calculate correlations because it reveals salient patterns in the network dynamics. Using distractor trial fixation activity is another angle from which to examine the network dynamics that give less informative results, i.e., correlations do not rise and drop saliently over time (Figure S1A). Thus, the results of BG and of FK seem incompatible. The robust one-dimensional dynamics observed in the BG data require that the local anatomical connectivity of LIP selectively amplify only one multi-neuronal activity pattern. How can this same anatomical connectivity realize dynamics that deviate so far from the one activity pattern that it so strongly amplifies? We found the answer in a simple model of the interactions between two coupled LIP LNs. This model replicates the FK findings and yet reduces to the one-dimensional dynamics that characterize the BG findings when the two LNs are not coupled. We model two LNs in LIP, each composed of excitatory (E) and inhibitory (I) neurons that share an RF, with randomly distributed neuronal time constants (Figures 2A and 2B ; see SI section 2.2 for details of the model). Connections between the neurons are sparse, and their strengths are randomly distributed. Within each LN, excitatory connections are, on average, stronger than inhibitory connections. This dominance of excitation is consistent with evidence based on dendritic structure of increased connectivity between excitatory cells in LIP compared to primary sensory cortices (Elston and Rosa, 1997Elston G.N. Rosa M.G. The occipitoparietal pathway of the macaque monkey: comparison of pyramidal cell morphology in layer III of functionally related cortical visual areas.Cereb. Cortex. 1997; 7: 432-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Such connectivity within an LN, when it’s not connected to another LN, amplifies a single pattern, one of increased activity across most cells, more strongly than all other patterns. The LIP cortical surface contains rough topological maps of visual space (Blatt et al., 1990Blatt G.J. Andersen R.A. Stoner G.R. Visual receptive field organization and cortico-cortical connections of the lateral intraparietal area (area LIP) in the macaque.J. Comp. Neurol. 1990; 299: 421-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar, Patel et al., 2010Patel G.H. Shulman G.L. Baker J.T. Akbudak E. Snyder A.Z. Snyder L.H. Corbetta M. Topographic organization of macaque area LIP.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2010; 107: 4728-4733Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Neurons sharing an RF, which are more likely to be located close to each other on the cortical surface, make up an LN in our model. We model the connections of I cells to be restricted to the LN to which they belong, for inhibitory interneurons generally only make short-range projections, whereas E cells can potentially make long-range projections to the other LN. Since no significant interaction between RFs was observed in the BG dataset (quantified in Bisley and Goldberg, 2006Bisley J.W. Goldberg M.E. Neural correlates of attention and distractibility in the lateral intraparietal area.J. Neurophysiol. 2006; 95: 1696-1717Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), we infer that for these RFs, the corresponding LNs are not directly connected (Figure 2A). In contrast, by maximizing surround suppression, FK selected for RFs that did interact. Since the interaction observed was predominantly suppressive, it’s likely that the excitatory connections from each LN are stronger to the I cells than to the E cells of the other LN. For simplicity, we model the across-network connections as being from the E cells of each LN to the other LN’s I cells only, with sparse and random connectivity (Figure 2B). Our results do not change if we include weaker across-network E-to-E connections (data not shown). We use a standard linear firing rate model (SI section 2.2; Dayan and Abbott, 2005Dayan P. Abbott L.F. Theoretical Neuroscience. The MIT Press, 2005Google Scholar) to simulate the trial-averaged activity in the experiments. We do not explicitly simulate single trials,for we have no knowledge of the single-trial population dynamics during the tasks. The experiments involve a variety of sensory, motor, and cognitive processes that likely give rise to a variety of external inputs to LIP during a trial, which we model as the following four types. (1) Fixation input, which is spontaneous firing from the external input sources when there is no stimulus in or saccade plan to the RF, such as during the fixation period. (2) Visual input, which is bottom-up input to an LN when a visual stimulus is in the RF, which is strong upon stimulus onset and becomes weak as the stimulus is sustained. Visual input arrives from areas that could include V2, V3, V3A, V4, middle temporal area (MT), and inferotemporal cortex (Baizer et al., 1991Baizer J.S. Ungerleider L.G. Desimone R.

Neurol. 2000; 428: 112-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar). (3) Delay input, which is persistent top-down input to an LN when a saccade is being planned to the RF, arriving from frontal areas such as the frontal eye field (FEF) or dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC; Blatt et al., 1990Blatt G.J. Andersen R.A. Stoner G.R. Visual receptive field organization and cortico-cortical connections of the lateral intraparietal area (area LIP) in the macaque.J. Comp.

Topography of projections to posterior cortical areas from the macaque frontal eye fields.J. Comp. Neurol. 1995; 353: 291-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar; in SI section 3, we discuss other possible mechanisms underlying delay activity and their implications for our model). (4) Expectation input, which is top-down input to one LN during the fixation period before target onset, when the animal is in a block of trials during which the target always appears in the RF of that LN (as in the blocked experiment of FK). Expectation input likely also arrives from frontal areas such as FEF or dlPFC (Coe et al., 2002Coe B. Tomihara K. Matsuzawa M. Hikosaka O. Visual and anticipatory bias in three cortical eye fields of the monkey during an adaptive decision-making task.J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 5081-5090Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, Roesch and Olson, 2003Roesch M.R. Olson C.R. Impact of expected reward on neuronal activity in prefrontal cortex, frontal and supplementary eye fields and premotor cortex.J. Neurophysiol. 2003; 90: 1766-1789Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). The total external input to the neurons at any time is the sum of one or more of these four types of input. For each of the four types of input, input to each cell is independently drawn from a uniform distribution, with ranges of the distributions chosen to fit experimentally observed neural responses. Thus, it is important that the inputs from different sources are uncorrelated. In addition, the external input contains weak, temporally correlated noise that is independent for different neurons, simply to produce small firing rate fluctuations similar to those seen in the experiments. In the experiments, different neurons are recorded from different LIP locations and have different RF positions. As in Ganguli et al., 2008Ganguli S. Bisley J.W. Roitman J.D. Shadlen M.N. Goldberg M.E. Miller K.D. One-dimensional dynamics of attention and decision making in LIP.Neuron. 2008; 58: 15-25Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, we interpret this to mean that these neurons are situated in different LNs, which share the same set of connectivity, neuronal, and input statistics. To model this, we run the simulation multiple times, each time with a different random instantiation of network connectivity, neuronal time constants, and input patterns, and “record” from a single randomly chosen cell during each simulation. Each simulation includes target and distractor trials for the recorded cell. Figures 2C and 2D show the population peristimulus time histograms (PSTHs) from such simulations of the BG (Figure 2C) and FK (Figure 2D) experiments, which reproduce the experimentally observed firing patterns, including the observed absence or presence of surround interactions. More significantly, our model reproduces the apparently conflicting network dynamics of the two experiments, as revealed from the correlation analysis: the BG model shows one-dimensional dynamics on slow timescales (Figure 2E), and the FK model shows the same higher-dimensional dynamics as experimentally observed (Figure 2F).

https://openalex.org/W2566902400,"Cell adhesion plays an important role in determining cell shape and function in a variety of physiological and pathophysiological conditions. While links between metabolism and cell adhesion were previously suggested, the exact context and molecular details of such a cross-talk remain incompletely understood. Here we show that PGC-1α, a pivotal transcriptional co-activator of metabolic gene expression, acts to inhibit expression of cell adhesion genes. Using cell lines, primary cells and mice, we show that both endogenous and exogenous PGC-1α down-regulate expression of a variety of cell adhesion molecules. Furthermore, results obtained using mRNA stability measurements as well as intronic RNA expression are consistent with a transcriptional effect of PGC-1α on cell adhesion gene expression. Interestingly, the L2/L3 motifs of PGC-1α, necessary for nuclear hormone receptor activation, are only partly required for inhibition of several cell adhesion genes by PGC-1α. Finally, PGC-1α is able to modulate adhesion of primary fibroblasts and hepatic stellate cells to extracellular matrix proteins. Our results delineate a cross talk between a central pathway controlling metabolic regulation and cell adhesion, and identify PGC-1α as a molecular link between these two major cellular networks."

Universal screening using a nonverbal test of cognitive ability increased representation of minorities and economically disadvantaged students in school programs for gifted and talented children. Card and Giuliano show that in years before and after this screening process, when students had to be referred by teachers or parents for testing into gifted programs, the programs were disproportionately populated by students who were white and from higher-income neighborhoods. These results suggest that teachers and parents commonly fail to recognize potential among minorities, the poor, or those who have limited proficiency with the English language.
