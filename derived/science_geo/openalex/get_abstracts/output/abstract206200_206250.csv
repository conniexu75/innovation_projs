Electrical stimulation of the ventromedial hypothalamus inhibited the conditioned movements and food intake in hungry goats. This also occurred in those satiated goats in which eating and conditioned movements were elicited by stimulation of the lateral hypothalamic area. Withdrawal of the stimulation of the medial hypothalamus evoked a short aftereffect in the form of a recovery or increase in the trained movements and food intake.

The dose required to produce a threshold lesion in mouse brain increases from 30,000 rad with a beam 1000 µ in diameter to 1.1 x 10 6 rad with a beam 25 µ in diameter."

It involves a staining reaction of Hfr and F+ coli, but not F- coli, when mixed with strains of Salmonella typhimurium. This reaction was used as a guide in following the transfer of the F agent to Salmonella and back to E. coli. The F agent in Salmonella seems to promote the same kinds of events that it promotes in E. coli."

The preceding paper (5) describes the rechromatography on diethylaminoethyl (DEAE) cellulose of thyrotropin preparations assaying 20 U.S.P. units per mg which resulted in fractions apparently containing only those glycoproteins with the biological activities ascribed to thyrotropin. By means of the starch-gel electrophoresis technique (6, 7) six active components designated as thyrotropins a to f were recognized to have been eluted progressively from the columns, and two of these components were obtained as what appeared to be essentially homogeneous preparations by electrophoretic criteria. The present paper reports further experiments to test the possibility that the biological activity could be separated from the glycoproteins of molecular weight of approximately 28,000 (8), and to determine if the same bands observed after anion exchange could be observed in the starch-gel patterns after cation exchange chromatography. Thyrotropin preparations which had been once chromatographed on DEAE-cellulose were rechromatographed on the cation exchanger CM-cellulose (3, 4, 9, 10) or on hydroxyl apatite (11-13). Chromatography on these media allowed a greatly improved separation of the inactive components h, i, and j (5) from what still proved to be the active components, a to f. It is of interest that the active components were found to emerge in reverse order from both CMcellulose and the hydroxyl apatite than from the anion exchanger (5), thus offering strong evidence that a principal difference between the active components is a difference of charge. The carbohydrate contents of fractions obtained both by anion exchange chromatography and by chromatography on hydroxyl apatite are presented. This paper also describes a comparative study of beef, sheep, and whale thyrotropins utilizing DEAE-cellulose chromatography (9, 14, 15), starch-gel electrophoresis (5-7, 15), and the starch-gel electrodialysis method for determination of approximate molecular weight (8)."

Preliminary findings are reported here in view of the widespread interest in the drugs from the point of view of pituitary-adrenal physiology1and in view of the current extensive use of reserpine in medicine."

Such symptoms suggested cerebellar lesions and indeed lesions have been demonstrated in the cerebellum1–3, but only occasionally. Recently, an alteration has been made in our technique of taking material from the cerebellum for the routine histological examinations. Dorso-ventral sections have been taken through the middle of the cerebellum, parallel to the long axis of the brain, instead of the usual slice from a sagittal section through the vermis. Examination of such sections from nine brains of sheep affected with natural scrapie showed in each case degeneration and vacuolation of the Purkinje cells in a number of the folia of the paraflocculus (Fig. 1), while occasionally the neurones of the dentate nucleus were also affected. In the midbrains of these animals, in addition to vacuolation of the pigmented cells of the raphe, chromatolysis of the neurones of the red nucleus was a constant finding, while vacuolation was also often present. In the pons the neurones of the nucleus of the abducens nerve were always degenerated and vacuolated, but in the cells of the reticular formation changes were present in seven cases out of nine. In the medulla, lesions were found in the nuclei of the raphe, arcuate and formatio reticularis alba. Lesions of the above nuclei of the medulla have previously been shown to be constantly present in both natural and experimental scrapie3,4."

1,2,3, its wide distribution has been expected concerning its actual meaning in polynucleotide synthesis in living body. Though it has been found to exist in several bacteria4,5, its occurrence in animal source has not been demonstrated except in human sperm reported by Hakim6. In our laboratory, the existence of this enzyme in animal cells has been examined, and the occurrence of it in atypical epithelioma (Guerin strain) was found. The results are briefly reported here."
