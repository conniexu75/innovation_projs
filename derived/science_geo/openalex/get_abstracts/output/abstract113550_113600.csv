https://openalex.org/W1983547790,"Acute promyelocytic leukemia is a clonal expansion of hematopoietic precursors blocked at the promyelocytic stage. The differentiation block can be reversed by retinoic acid, which induces blast maturation both in vitro and in vivo. Acute promyelocytic leukemia is characterized by a 15;17 chromosome translocation with breakpoints within the retinoic acid alpha receptor (RAR alpha) gene on 17 and the PML gene, which encodes a putative transcription factor, on 15. A PML-RAR alpha fusion protein is formed as a consequence of the translocation. We expressed the PML-RAR alpha protein in U937 myeloid precursor cells and showed that they lost the capacity to differentiate under the action of different stimuli (vitamin D3 and transforming growth factor beta 1), acquired enhanced sensitivity to retinoic acid, and exhibited a higher growth rate consequent to diminished apoptotic cell death. These results provide evidence of biological activity of PML-RAR alpha and recapitulate critical features of the promyelocytic leukemia phenotype."

https://openalex.org/W1978611748,"Attachment of ubiquitin to proteins is catalyzed by a family of ubiquitin-conjugating (UBC) enzymes. Although these enzymes are essential for many cellular processes, their molecular functions remain unclear because no physiological target has been identified for any of them. Here we show that four UBC proteins (UBC4, UBC5, UBC6, and UBC7) target the yeast MATα2 transcriptional regulator for intracellular degradation by two distinct ubiquitination pathways. UBC6 and UBC7 define one of the pathways and can physically associate. The complex targets the Deg1 degradation signal of α2, a conclusion underscored by the finding that UBC6 is encoded by DOA2, a gene previously implicated in Deg1-mediated degradation. These data reveal an unexpected overlap in substrate specificity among diverse UBC enzymes and suggest a combinatorial mechanism of substrate selection in which UBC enzymes partition into multiple ubiquitination complexes."
https://openalex.org/W1481519187,"Recent molecular cloning studies have identified four distinct members (NHE-1,-2,-3,-4) of the Na/H exchanger gene family that are expressed in a tissue-specific pattern. To examine some of their functional properties, full-length cDNAs for two of these isoforms, rat NHE-1 and NHE-3, were stably transfected in Na/H exchanger-deficient Chinese hamster ovary cells (AP-1) and assayed for transport activity by measuring amiloride-inhibitable H(+)-activated 22Na+ influx. Pharmacological analyses revealed that the activity of NHE-1 was substantially more sensitive to inhibition by amiloride and its analogues than NHE-3. Similarly, both isoforms were differentially sensitive to inhibition by cimetidine, clonidine, and harmaline; agents also known to inhibit the activity of the Na/H exchanger. Their rank order of potency for NHE-1 was cimetidine > harmaline > or = clonidine whereas the reverse order was observed for NHE-3. The isoforms were also distinguished by their kinetic properties. While the extracellular Na+ (Na+o) dependence of both isoforms showed simple, saturating Michaelis-Menten kinetics, NHE-1 exhibited a 2-fold lower affinity for Na+o than NHE-3, with apparent KNa values of 10.0 +/- 1.4 and 4.7 +/- 0.6 mM, respectively. In contrast to Na+o, intracellular H+ (H+i) activated both isoforms by a positive cooperative mechanism. However, NHE-1 had a 2-fold higher apparent affinity for H+i compared to NHE-3, with half-maximal activation values of pK 6.75 +/- 0.05 and 6.45 +/- 0.08, respectively. Other external cations also interacted with both exchangers. Li+o and H+o inhibited 22Na+ influx by both isoforms with similar kinetics. In contrast, K+o inhibited 22Na+ influx by NHE-1, but had no effect on NHE-3. Thus NHE-1 and -3 exhibited diverse functional properties when expressed in the same cell type. Furthermore, the functional properties associated with NHE-3 closely mimicked those described for the apical membrane Na/H exchanger of renal proximal tubules, suggesting that these proteins are molecularly identical."
https://openalex.org/W1607832506,"We have mutated a single residue, Thr373 [corrected], in the C-terminal portion of the third intracellular loop of the alpha 2C10-adrenergic receptor into five different amino acids. In analogy with the effect of similar mutations in the alpha 1B- and beta 2-adrenergic receptors, these substitutions resulted in two major biochemical modifications: 1) increased constitutive activity of the alpha 2-adrenergic receptor leading to agonist-independent inhibition of adenylyl cyclase and 2) increased affinity of the receptor for binding agonist but not antagonists. The increased constitutive activity of the mutated alpha 2-adrenergic receptors could be inhibited by pertussis toxin, clearly indicating that it results from spontaneous ligand-independent receptor coupling to Gi. In contrast, the increased affinity of the mutant receptors for binding agonists was unaffected by pertussis toxin treatment, indicating that this is an inherent property of the receptors not dependent on interaction with Gi. Coexpression of the receptor mutants with the receptor-specific kinase, beta ARK1, indicated that the constitutively alpha 2-adrenergic receptors are substrates for beta-adrenergic receptor kinase (beta ARK)-mediated phosphorylation even in the absence of agonist. These findings strengthen the idea that constitutively adrenergic receptors mimic the active state of a G protein-coupled receptor adopting conformations similar to those induced by agonist when it binds to wild type receptors. In addition, these results extend the notion that in the adrenergic receptor family the C-terminal portion of the third intracellular loop plays a general role in the processes involved in receptor activation."
https://openalex.org/W1674557579,"Receptor-like protein tyrosine phosphatases (receptor-PTPs) represent a novel family of transmembrane proteins that are thought to play important roles in cellular regulation. They consist of a cytoplasmic catalytic region, a single transmembrane segment and an extracellular, putative ligand-binding domain, but the nature of their physiological ligands is unknown. We have recently cloned a new receptor-PTP (RPTP mu), the ectodomain of which includes an Ig-like and four fibronectin type III-like domains, suggesting that RPTP mu may be involved in cell-cell or cell-matrix interactions. To test this hypothesis, we expressed RPTP mu in insect Sf9 cells using recombinant baculovirus. We demonstrate that RPTP mu dramatically promotes cell-to-cell adhesion in a homophilic, Ca(2+)-independent manner. No adhesion is observed in Sf9 cells expressing a chimeric RPTP mu molecule containing the extracellular domain of the epidermal growth factor receptor. Furthermore, cells expressing an enzymatically inactive, point-mutated RPTP mu or a truncated form of RPTP mu, lacking the entire catalytic region, show adhesive properties indistinguishable from those of wild-type RPTP mu, indicating that the catalytic domain is not essential for RPTP mu-mediated adhesion. These results assign a physiological role for RPTP mu in signaling cell-cell recognition."
https://openalex.org/W1995270566,"Endogenous and infectious mouse mammary tumor viruses (MMTVs) encode in their 3' long terminal repeat a protein that exerts superantigen activity; that is, it is able to interact with T cells via the variable domain of the T cell receptor (TCR) beta chain. We show here that transmission of an infectious MMTV is prevented when superantigen-reactive cells are absent through either clonal deletion due to the expression of an endogenous MTV with identical superantigen specificity or exclusion due to expression of a transgenic TCR beta chain that does not interact with the viral superantigen. A strict requirement for superantigen-reactive T cells is also seen for a local immune response following MMTV infection. This immune response locally amplifies the number of MMTV-infected B cells, most likely owing to their clonal expansion. Collectively, our data indicate that a superantigen-induced immune response is critical for the MMTV life cycle."
https://openalex.org/W2124281485,"Activation of protein kinase A (PKA) by cAMP results in phosphorylation of cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) and induction of specific gene expression. However, whether CREB participates directly in basal (PKA-independent) transcription is still an open question, and existing studies conflict over the identification of putative basal activation domains. In the present study, the activation domain of CREB, whether fused to the GAL4 DNA binding domain (CRG) or in native CREB, stimulated basal activity of the minimal tk promoter, but not the minimal SV40 early promoter. Cotransfection with PKI, a specific inhibitor of PKA, blocked PKA-induced expression of both promoters, but did not block CRG-mediated basal expression of the tk promoter. In addition, both CRG and a PKA phosphorylation site mutant provided comparable stimulation of basal tk promoter activity. Examination of a series of CREB deletion mutants mapped basal activity to interacting domains, located on either side of the previously identified PKA activation domain (amino acids 98-142). This PKA-independent activity mapped primarily to a bipartite COOH-terminal basal activation domain (amino acids 165-252). Its major component bears no obvious homology to previously identified activation domains, whereas a minor component is glutamine-rich. This COOH-terminal domain acts independently and provides the majority of basal activation but requires an NH2-terminal domain (amino acids 41-86) to provide full basal activity. A repressor domain (amino acids 142-165), deletion of which enhanced both basal and PKA-activated transcription, was also identified. This work establishes that CREB contains distinct basal and PKA-activated domains, that they operate independently for both loss of function and gain of function, and that they work on different promoters in different cell types."
https://openalex.org/W1517749679,"Human leukemic HL-60 cells are differentiated into granulocytic cells by retinoic acid, and this differentiation is preceded by the induction of an ecto-enzyme of NAD glycohydrolase (NADase). The NADase specifically induced by retinoic acid appeared to be encoded by human leukocyte cell surface antigen CD38 as follows. 1) There was an early expression of CD38 mRNA, together with the induction of the NADase activity, in the retinoic acid-treated HL-60 cells. 2) The time course of the expression of CD38 antigen on the cell surface was well correlated with that of the induction of NADase activity. 3) The NADase activity solubilized from the differentiated HL-60 cell membrane could be immunoprecipitated with an anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody. 4) Introduction of the CD38 cDNA into Escherichia coli cells resulted in the expression of an NADase, the activity of which was inhibited by dithiothreitol. The NADase activity in the differentiated cells was also inhibited by the reducing reagent. These results clearly indicated that the dithiothreitol-sensitive NADase activity induced by retinoic acid in HL-60 cells is attributed to the molecule of human leukocyte cell surface antigen CD38, which contains cysteine-rich cytoplasmic domain within its molecule."
https://openalex.org/W1533629889,"Cytochrome c oxidase contains a copper center, CuA, which is involved in electron transfer from cytochrome c to the oxygen-reducing active site. This center is distinct from types 1, 2, and 3 copper sites and related only to a purple copper center in nitrous oxide reductase. At present it is not clear whether this site is mononuclear or is comprised of two copper atoms in a mixed valence (Cu(I)-Cu(II)) configuration. Here we use a model of CuA, engineered into a structurally related but initially copperless protein, to study the structure of this copper center. The results from biochemical analysis, site-directed mutagenesis, and electrospray mass spectrometry support the binuclear model. Two cysteines, two histidines, and one methionine are the major ligands of two coppers. Substitution of these residues results in either a complete loss of color or dramatic changes in the absorbance spectrum. In contrast, substitution of the invariant glutamate residue, which is located between the copper-binding cysteines, leads to a minor perturbation of the optical spectrum."
https://openalex.org/W1510941613,"The Rhizobium meliloti two-component system FixL/FixJ regulates nitrogen fixation in response to oxygen during symbiosis. FixJ is a transcriptional activator of critical nif and fix promoters; its in vivo activity is enhanced by FixL in diminished oxygen (David, M., Daveran, M.-L., Batut, J., Dedieu, A., Domergue, O., Ghai, J., Hertig, C., Boistard, P., and Kahn, D. (1988) Cell 54, 671-683; Virts, E. L., Stanfield, S. W., Helinski, D. R., and Ditta, G. S. (1988) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 85, 3062-3065). FixL* is a soluble truncated version of FixL that contains heme; it catalyzes its autophosphorylation and the phosphorylation of FixJ (Gilles-Gonzalez, M.A., Ditta, G. S., and Helinski, D. R. (1991) Nature 350, 170-172). We examine the kinetics of phosphoryl transfer in this system. First, there is a slow autophosphorylation of FixL* in ATP that is accelerated in the absence of oxygen and in the presence of Mn2+. This reaction is reversible, i.e. phospho-FixL* reacts with ADP to generate ATP. Since the reverse reaction is faster, most FixL* is not phosphorylated at equilibrium. Next, there is a rapid phosphoryl transfer directly from phospho-FixL* to FixJ that is unaffected by oxygen. Finally, phospho-FixJ is hydrolyzed; this reaction is very fast and not controlled by oxygen. We propose that in addition to the oxygen signal previously noted in vivo, energy charge and manganese concentration are also indicators of symbiosis that impact on the induction of nitrogen fixation genes."
https://openalex.org/W1481860092,"Na/K-ATPase in renal epithelium is expressed at the basolateral surface and thus is critical for vectorial solute transport. One potential mode of regulation of Na/K-ATPase involves the intracellular effector protein kinase C (PKC). In kidney cell lines, activation of PKC by the phorbol ester phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PDBu) (1 microM) inhibited Na/K-ATPase transport activity in OK cells (Vmax decreased 42%; p < 0.02), but not in LLC-PK1 cells. By immunoblot, both cell types expressed detectable levels of PKC alpha and PKC sigma. In response to PDBu, PKC alpha translocated from the cytosol to the membrane fractions of both cell lines. Phorbol ester treatment increased incorporation of 32PO4 in multiple substrates in both cell types, but a approximately 109-kDa substrate with neutral pI was detected only in the OK cell. Anti-LEAVE, directed against a highly conserved sequence in the H4-H5 loop of all known alpha isoforms of Na/K-ATPase, recognized a approximately 109-kDa membrane protein from both cell lines. Anti-LEAVE also identified a protein that comigrated with the large phosphoprotein which was only present in OK cells. Following 32PO4 loading and PDBu treatment, anti-LEAVE immunoprecipitated a approximately 109-kDa phosphoprotein in OK but not LLC-PK1 cells. These data support the notion that PKC is capable of phosphorylating the alpha subunit and inhibiting Na/K-ATPase transport activity in intact renal cells. Furthermore, they suggest that some forms of Na/K-ATPase in the kidney are not susceptible to PKC phosphorylation and that this heterogeneity may contribute to response diversity."
https://openalex.org/W1927345484,"Thiol reagents have been shown to increase cytosolic Ca2+ in several cell types. In non-muscle cells, these agents induce Ca2+ spikes by increasing the sensitivity of the intracellular Ca2+ stores to D-myo-inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3). We have investigated the effects of thimerosal and oxidized glutathione on the binding properties of the InsP3 receptor in permeabilized hepatocytes and liver and cerebellar membranes. Thimerosal, at the maximal concentration of 100 microM, decreased the KD for the InsP3 binding to permeabilized hepatocytes and cerebellar membranes from 16 to 3 nM and from 25 to 8 nM, respectively, without affecting the maximal binding capacities. On liver membranes, both thimerosal and high Ca2+ concentrations increased the affinity for InsP3 binding. The Ca2+ and the thimerosal effects were differentiated by kinetic experiments. In low Ca2+ media, two kinetic components were identified and thimerosal decreased the rate of dissociation from both these components without affecting the rate of association. In the high Ca2+ medium, a single kinetic component was found with a very slow rate of dissociation. These data suggest that the InsP3 receptor exists in different states. The high-affinity inactive state induced by high Ca2+ concentrations displays slow rates of association and dissociation. The binding properties of the receptor in its active state can be regulated by thiol reagents which increase the affinity by decreasing the dissociation rate constants. At a resting concentration of 100-200 nM, Ca2+ has two effects: it increases the affinity of the active state of the receptor as thiol reagents do and transforms part of the receptors into the inactive high-affinity state."
https://openalex.org/W1508602313,"We have studied the functions of the juxtamembrane domain (941-989) of the human insulin receptor by site-directed mutagenesis. Tyrosine phosphorylation of pp185 was impaired in Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing the receptors with the alteration of Tyr960, but not of Tyr953 or Tyr972, to Phe (CHO-Y960F cells) as compared with cells expressing the normal receptors. In CHO-Y960F cells, tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1), the activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase in the anti-phosphotyrosine and anti-IRS-1 immunoprecipitates, the activation of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase, and biological actions were also impaired. In addition, although the deletion of residues 954-965 severely impaired insulin internalization, the deletion of NPXY (957-960), the internalization signal of the low density lipoprotein receptor, did not affect internalization. Moreover, neither the deletions around Tyr953 nor the alterations of the tyrosines (953, 960, or 972) significantly reduced internalization. These data suggest that: 1) Tyr960 is important for the recognition of pp185/IRS-1, the association of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase with pp185/IRS-1, and the activation of MAP kinase; 2) MAP kinase may lie downstream of pp185/IRS-1 in insulin's signal transduction; and 3) the juxtamembrane domain, but not NPXY or individual tyrosines, is important for insulin internalization."
https://openalex.org/W1568614184,"Epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor tyrosine kinase activity is down-regulated by a number of growth-modulating agents that activate protein kinase C and/or mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases. Although the mechanism is unclear, it has been hypothesized that phosphorylation of specific threonine residues leads to inhibition of the EGF receptor tyrosine kinase. Two sites phosphorylated on the EGF receptor in response to phorbol esters are possible mediators of this effect: threonine 654, the target of protein kinase C, and threonine 669, the target of MAP kinase and the major site of phosphorylation on the EGF receptor. In order to investigate the role of these residues in receptor regulation, we substituted glutamic acid to mimic the negative charge introduced by phosphorylation at these sites. The wild-type and mutant receptor cDNAs were then transfected into CHO cells that lack endogenous EGF receptor. The EGF binding properties of the mutant receptors were similar to those of the wild-type EGF receptors. EGF stimulated tyrosine kinase activity and DNA synthesis in cells expressing both mutant receptors, indicating that the mutant EGF receptors are biologically active. Treatment of cells with phorbol esters inhibited the high affinity EGF binding and tyrosine kinase activities of both mutant and wild-type EGF receptors. These results indicate that acidic residues at either the Thr-654 or Thr-669 site modulate but do not block EGF receptor signalling. Furthermore, this data demonstrates that the mutant EGF receptors are still a target for inhibition by phorbol esters. Thus, events other than phosphorylation of Thr-654 or Thr-669 appear to be required for receptor down-regulation by protein kinase C or MAP kinase."
https://openalex.org/W1600361751,"This report describes the kinetics and molecular aspects of neurotensin internalization in neurons. Incubation of alpha-125I-Bolton-Hunter neurotensin-(2-13) with cortical neurons at 37 degrees C was followed by a rapid internalization of the peptide bound to its receptors. This process was completed within 20 min and was inhibited either irreversibly by the general endocytosis inhibitor phenylarsine oxide or reversibly by incubation at low temperature (0-4 degrees C). The discrepancy of maximal binding capacities observed in the presence (150 fmol/mg of protein) or in the absence (250 fmol/mg of protein) of internalization inhibitors could be attributed to the appearance of a new pool of neurotensin binding sites on the cell surface rather than a recycling of internalized receptors. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis in denaturing conditions revealed that three different protein subunits of 50, 60, and 100 kDa were covalently labeled at 37 degrees C with a radioactive photoreactive analogue of neurotensin. The 50- and 60-kDa subunits remained labeled when internalization was blocked, whereas the specific labeling of the 100-kDa protein was abolished. These results suggest that neurotensin-induced internalization of the 50- and 60-kDa subunits initially present on the cell surface triggers insertion of the 100-kDa subunit into the membrane from an intracellular compartment. Subcellular fractionation experiments have shown that, in the absence of neurotensin, the 100-kDa protein is located in an intracellular vesicular fraction of neurons."
https://openalex.org/W1543741267,"The Escherichia coli RuvA and RuvB proteins mediate the branch migration of Holliday junctions in vitro. In the presence of stoichiometric amounts of RuvB (1 RuvB dimer/12 nucleotides), branch migration can occur without need for RuvA. However, RuvA is required when the RuvB concentration is reduced 4-fold or more. Under optimal conditions, we found the minimal protein requirement to be 1 RuvB dimer per 500-1100 nucleotides and 1 RuvA tetramer per 600-1200 nucleotides. To determine the roles of RuvA and RuvB in branch migration, we compared branch migration reactions mediated by RuvB only and by RuvA and RuvB. The time courses of the two reactions were similar, and both required ATP and Mg2+. However, RuvB-mediated branch migration occurred at lower ATP concentrations (> or = 200 microM) and higher Mg2+ concentrations (> or = 10 mM MgCl2) than the reaction mediated by RuvA and RuvB (> or = 1 mM ATP, > or = 5 mM MgCl2). The Mg2+ requirement for RuvB-mediated branch migration reflects the Mg2+ requirement of RuvB for DNA binding (Muller, B., Tsaneva, I.R., and West, S. C. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 17185-17189) and can be overcome by addition of RuvA. These results indicate that RuvA protein facilitates the interaction of RuvB with DNA."
https://openalex.org/W1576792225,"Using quantitative gel retardation assays the properties of the bovine papilloma virus (BPV) origin recognition protein E1 and the effect of the viral E2 protein on the binding of E1 to BPV origin DNA were examined. As reported previously (Seo, Y.S., Mueller, F., Lusky, M., Gibbs, E., Kim, H.-Y., Phillips, B. and J. Hurwitz (1993) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 90, 2865-2869), the E1 protein binds specifically to DNA sequences within the BPV origin (ori+) of replication. We also show that the presence of MgCl2 and ATP could stabilize the E1 ori+ DNA complex. At low levels of E1, ori+ DNA binding was greatly stimulated by the viral E2 protein when the intact E2 binding site 12 was present on the DNA. In addition DNA-protein complexes formed in the presence of both E1 and E2 were more stable than those formed with E1 alone. In the absence of an E2 binding site the E2 protein inhibited the binding of E1 to the BPV origin. Spacing of 0 or 9 base pairs between the E1 binding site and the E2 binding site 12 abolished the stimulation of E1-DNA binding by E2, whereas spacing of 6 base pairs between the two binding sites allowed for efficient stimulation. The data presented account for a direct role of E2 in BPV DNA replication. We propose that the cooperative binding of both the E1 and E2 proteins to BPV ori+ DNA is mediated by protein-protein interactions and by protein-DNA interactions, which include the formation of specific contacts of E2 with DNA."
https://openalex.org/W1569902518,"Formylated Met-Leu-Phe (fMLP), platelet-activating factor (PAF), ATP, and various nonhydrolyzable guanine nucleotides stimulated accumulation of phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4,5)P3) in intact human neutrophils. A protocol was devised to selectively inhibit the capacity of the nucleotide-sensitive receptors to elicit accumulation of PtdIns (3,4,5)P3. This enabled study of the regulation of phosphoinositide 3OH-kinase (PI3K) activities in permeabilized neutrophils free from interference due to activation of cell-surface nucleotide receptors. FMLP, PAF, and nonhydrolyzable GTP analogues stimulated an increase in the concentration, and rate of synthesis, of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 in permeabilized neutrophils by increasing the rate of a PtdIns(4,5)P2-directed PI3K-catalyzed reaction. A number of characteristics of these responses, including their relative sensitivities to inhibition by pertussis toxin and guanosine 5'-beta-(thio)diphosphate, suggested that fMLP and PAF increased this PI3K activity via the actions of heterotrimeric G-proteins. Basal and guanosine 5'-gamma-(thio)triphosphate/fMLP-stimulated increases in PI3K activity were resistant to changes in free calcium concentrations, staurosporine, acute treatment with phorbol esters, and evidently to permeabilization. This, in conjunction with other work, indicates that the PAF and fMLP-induced increase in PtdIns(4,5)P2-directed PI3K activity is not being produced via activation of a currently defined G-protein regulated effector enzyme, or a protein tyrosine kinase coordinated mechanism of a type already known to regulate PI3K activities."
https://openalex.org/W1500574190,"Expression of the human epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene is inhibited by ligand-activated thyroid hormone receptor (T3R). Binding sites for Sp1 and for the T3R.retinoid X receptor (RXR) complex overlap in a functional core of the EGFR promoter. Sp1 inhibited binding of the T3R complex to this 36-base pair (bp) EGFR element in vitro but did not affect binding of the T3R complex to a positive thyroid hormone response element (TRE). In Drosophila SL2 cells, which lack Sp1 and T3R, function of the EGFR promoter was strongly dependent on Sp1. Sp1-dependent promoter function was inhibited by ligand-activated T3R but not by mutant T3R defective in DNA or T3 binding. RXR increased the extent of inhibition. Sp1 enhanced activity of the 36-bp element placed 5‘ to a minimal TATA promoter and this enhancement was also repressed by T3R. Mutations in the 36-bp element were unable to separate Sp1 and T3R functions. However, addition of a second half-site 5‘ to the existing site in an inverted repeat configuration created a positive TRE. In the absence of ligand, T3R inhibited Sp1 stimulation from this altered element; addition of T3 reversed the inhibition. When a dimeric TRE is separated from Sp1-binding sites strong synergism was observed. The nature and location of the TRE thus strongly influence biological responses. A TRE site in the EGFR promoter that overlaps an Sp1-binding site inhibits Sp1 function but is unable to direct positive function."
https://openalex.org/W2636914,"Bacillus subtilis contains the gene for CTP:glycerol-3-phosphate cytidylyltransferase, which is involved in biosynthesis of the major teichoic acid of the B. subtilis cell wall. When this gene was expressed in Escherichia coli under the control of the T7 promoter, the glycerol-3-phosphate cytidylyltransferase accumulated to a level of about 15% of cellular protein. The expressed glycerol-3-phosphate cytidylyltransferase was purified to homogeneity by ion-exchange chromatography, gel filtration, and affinity chromatography on blue Sepharose. Approximately 47 mg of pure enzyme was obtained from a 660-ml culture. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis indicated that the subunit molecular weight of the purified enzyme was about 15,000. The molecular weight of the native enzyme was found to be 30,900 by gel filtration analysis, suggesting that the native enzyme is a homodimer. The pH optimum was very broad, from 6.5 to 9.5, and the enzyme was stable at alkaline conditions. A divalent cation, either Co2+, Mg2+, Mn2+, or Fe2+, was required for enzyme activity. Km values for CTP and glycerol 3-phosphate were 3.85 and 3.23 mM, respectively, and the Vmax was 185 units/mg of protein. Initial rate studies and product inhibition patterns indicated that the enzyme catalyzes the reaction by means of a rapid eqilibrium random order mechanism. The availability of large amounts of glycerol-3-phosphate cytidylyltransferase will facilitate enzymological and structural studies on this model cytidylyltransferase."
https://openalex.org/W1528797989,"The neurotoxicant 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) has been shown to generate reactive oxygen species during its interaction with monoamine oxidase type B (MAO-B). The kinetic parameters, Km and Vmax, for MAO-B-catalyzed oxidation of MPTP to the corresponding species MPDP+ were found to be 0.194 mM and 0.335 microM/min, respectively. The generation of superoxide (.O2-) and hydroxyl (.OH) radicals was detected as the 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide (DMPO) spin adduct by spin-trapping in combination with EPR techniques. Addition of Fe2+ (10 microM) to this system caused a 5-fold enhancement in EPR signal intensity of the DMPO-OH adduct. Catalase, a scavenger of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), inhibited the DMPO-OH spin adduct formation in a dose-dependent manner, indicating that H2O2 is produced in the MAO-B catalyzed oxidation of MPTP. Ethanol, a well known scavenger of hydroxyl radical, rapidly produced an alpha-hydroxyethyl radical signal. Superoxide dismutase inhibited the formation of DMPO-O2- and DMPO-OH spin adducts in a dose-dependent fashion. These data suggest that superoxide radicals are produced during the oxidation of MPTP by MAO-B and that the generation of H2O2 and .OH was secondary to the production of .O2-. It appears likely that the nigrostriatal toxicity of MPTP leading to Parkinson's disease-like syndrome may in part be mediated via these reactive oxygen species."
https://openalex.org/W1548277221,"Pulse-chase labeling identified incomplete maturation of the cationic amino acid transporter that serves as the receptor for ecotropic retroviruses in infected NIH 3T3 fibroblasts. The molecular basis and functional consequences of this change were studied by expressing viral and receptor proteins in Xenopus oocytes. Expression of the ecotropic, but not polytropic, envelope surface protein, gp70, interfered with N-linked glycosylation of the permissive mouse, but not the nonpermissive, human transporter. Incomplete glycosylation may be a direct consequence of gp70 binding since the glycosylated residues, Asn223 and Asn229, are present in the envelope binding domain. Receptors bearing amino acid substitutions in Asn223 and/or Asn229 that prevent glycosylation function normally in virus infection and amino acid transport. However, gp70 expression sufficient to block binding of 125I-gp70 to the receptor in the plasma membrane decreased receptor-mediated arginine uptake by 50%. Taken together, these findings suggest that newly synthesized gp70 may bind to the receptor in the endoplasmic reticulum and prevent normal glycosylation during their transit to the plasma membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1787672602,"To investigate the mechanism responsible for the inhibition of glucose transport by dibutyryl cAMP (Bt2cAMP), two different transporter isoforms (GLUT1 and GLUT4) and several GLUT1/4 chimeric transporters were expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells by using a Sindbis virus expression system. Bt2cAMP inhibited GLUT4-mediated 2-deoxy[3H]glucose (2DOG) uptake by 50% but was without effect on GLUT1-mediated uptake. When the subcellular distribution of GLUT4 was assessed by quantitative immunocytochemistry, neither the overall concentration of GLUT4 nor the regional distribution of GLUT-4 within the plasma membrane was found to be altered by Bt2cAMP. Thus, inhibition of 2DOG uptake by Bt2cAMP appears to be due to a decrease in transporter activity rather than a decrease in the number of transporters exposed at the plasma membrane. By using chimeric transporters, a region of GLUT4 necessary for the inhibitory effect of Bt2cAMP was localized to the last 29 amino acids in the COOH terminus. This intracellular region contains the site (Ser488) phosphorylated in vitro by cAMP-dependent protein kinase (cAdPK). Changing Ser488 to an Ala abolished phosphorylation of GLUT4; however, the inhibitory effect of Bt2cAMP on glucose transport was not diminished by this mutation. Therefore, phosphorylation of GLUT4 was not required for the inhibition. The effects of other nucleotides on GLUT4 transport activity were assessed to investigate the role of cAdPK. Uptake of 2DOG by GLUT4 was inhibited by 8-bromo-AMP, but not by 8-bromo-cAMP, suggesting that the inhibitory effect did not involve activation of cAdPK. Results consistent with this interpretation were obtained with CHO cells (line 10248), which express a cAdPK that is resistant to activation by cAMP. No difference in the concentrations of Bt2cAMP required to inhibit GLUT4-mediated transport was observed in normal CHO cells and 10248 cells. The results presented suggest that the inhibitory effects of Bt2cAMP could be mediated by direct binding of a nucleotide to GLUT4 at a site involving the intracellular COOH terminus of the transporter."
https://openalex.org/W1542081673,"Synthetic peptides having the sequence of the calmodulin-binding autoinhibitory domain of the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (XIP) and of the plasma membrane Ca2+ pump (C28R2) inhibited the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SERCA) and plasma membrane (PMCA) Ca2+ pumps. XIP was nearly as effective in inhibiting both systems as C28R2, which had previously been considered to be the most powerful peptide inhibitor of PMCA. In contrast, calmodulin-binding peptides from non-Ca2+ transport proteins (calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II and myosin light chain kinase) showed only weak inhibition. The relative specificity and effectiveness of the peptides from the Ca2+ transport proteins, as well as the characteristics of their actions were similar in both SERCA and PMCA, suggesting a high degree of functional relatedness between these autoinhibitory regions. Secondary structure predictions show that the calmodulin-binding autoinhibitory domains of the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger and PMCA are predicted to form a beta structure which might be necessary for the observed cross-inhibition. The results also indicate that other domains of the Ca2+ transporters have common structural elements which interact with the autoinhibitory domains."

The present study was undertaken to test whether 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25-(OH)2D3) and its noncalcemic analogue, 22-oxa-1,25-(OH)2D3 (OCT), could suppress cell proliferation and PTHRP gene expression in an HTLV-I-infected T cell line, MT-2. OCT as well as 1,25-(OH)2D3 inhibited the proliferation of MT-2 cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Cell cycle analysis revealed that OCT, like the parent compound, caused a transition delay of cells through the G1 phase. OCT and 1,25-(OH)2D3 decreased the steady state levels of PTHRP mRNA, and nuclear runoff assays demonstrated that the effect of OCT occurred at a transcription level. As a result, OCT caused a reduction in PTHRP concentrations in the conditioned medium by approximately 50%. OCT inhibited not only the basal secretion but also the stimulation of PTHRP secretion by interleukin-2 or cAMP, which we had identified as two important stimulators. Northern blot analysis and the specific uptake of [3H]1,25-(OH)2D3 revealed unexpectedly that the vitamin D receptor was abundantly expressed in MT-2 cells. These results suggest that OCT, as well as 1,25-(OH)2D3, has the potential to suppress both cell proliferation and PTHRP gene expression through binding to the vitamin D receptor overexpressed in HTLV-I-infected T cells."
https://openalex.org/W2158141822,"Purified and reconstituted sodium channels have previously been shown to be functional in voltage-dependent ion conductance and in high affinity binding of tetrodotoxin and saxitoxin at neurotoxin receptor site 1 and alpha-scorpion toxins at receptor site 3, but high affinity binding of neurotoxins at receptor sites 2, 4, and 5 has not been demonstrated. The pyrethroid insecticide RU39568 enhances the specific binding of [3H]batrachotoxinin A 20-alpha-benzoate (BTX-B) to neurotoxin receptor site 2 on purified and reconstituted sodium channels up to 500-fold, reducing the Kd to 1.5 nM. Brevetoxins and alpha-scorpion toxins cause further allosteric enhancement of BTX-B binding. The pyrethroids deltamethrin and bifenthrin and the nonpyrethroid insecticide 2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)trichloroethane can partially substitute for RU39568 in enhancing BTX-B binding, but other pyrethroids are inactive. The brevetoxin PbTx-1 binds specifically to neurotoxin receptor site 5 on purified and reconstituted sodium channels with a Kd value of approximately 30 nM. Brevetoxin binding is enhanced up to 2-fold by the combination of batrachotoxin and RU39568. The allosteric enhancement of BTX-B binding by RU39568 is voltage dependent, decreasing progressively with depolarization to 0 mV. In contrast, PbTx-1 binding is not voltage dependent and PbTx-1 reduces the voltage dependence of the effect of RU39568. The results demonstrate restoration of high affinity binding and allosteric interactions of ligands at neurotoxin receptor sites 2 and 5 on purified and reconstituted sodium channels and provide an experimental approach to covalent labeling and identification of the peptide components of those receptor sites."
https://openalex.org/W1504222076,"The type I alpha regulatory subunits of cAMP-dependent protein kinase contain an autoinhibitor site, Arg94-Arg-Gly-Ala-Ile, which serves as a pseudosubstrate. To evaluate their contribution to subunit association, Arg94 and Arg95, key determinants for peptide recognition, were replaced singly and in tandem with Ala, Glu, and His. Unlike substrate peptides in which replacement of either arginine leads to an increase in Km of approximately 3 orders of magnitude, replacement of either arginine causes only a maximal 20-fold decrease in subunit association. Replacement of both arginine residues with alanine, however, generates a regulatory subunit that can no longer recombine with the catalytic subunit under physiological conditions when the regulatory subunit is saturated with cAMP. To evaluate more fully the specific consequences of replacing these 2 arginine residues, a rapid gel filtration chromatographic method was developed so that subunit affinity could be measured independently of assaying for catalytic activity. The R94,95A mutant shows a Kd(app) = 677 nM, representing an increase of greater than 3 orders of magnitude compared with the native subunits in the presence of MgATP. In the absence of MgATP, the Kd(app) for native regulatory subunit was 125 nM, whereas the Kd(app) for the R94,R95A mutant regulatory subunit was determined to 2.87 microM. When this mutant holoenzyme is assayed at microM concentrations, no activity is observed, whereas below microM, activity is observed because of cAMP-independent subunit dissociation."
https://openalex.org/W1584214433,"Photosystem II contains two redox active species, D and Z, which in the oxidized and paramagnetic form give rise to similar EPR signals. Both signals are broadened by anisotropic interactions and show no well-resolved hyperfine splittings, even at room temperature. D+ is a dark stable radical of unknown function. Z, on the other hand, acts as the intermediate electron carrier between the primary chlorophyll donor and the manganese catalytic site. In manganese-depleted photosystem II preparations, where Z+ is the terminal electron donor, the Z+ EPR signal can be easily detected. Isotopic labeling of intact cells of Synechocystis 6803 and EPR spectroscopy were used to demonstrate that D+ is a tyrosine radical (Barry, B.A., and Babcock, G. T. (1987) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 84, 7099-7103). However, since the Z+ signal is not observable in intact cyanobacterial cells, a definitive assignment of the Z redox active species has not yet been performed. Here, we describe the use of a purified photosystem II preparation to assign the Z+ EPR signal to a neutral tyrosine radical. Further, a comparison of the Z+ and D+ EPR lineshapes in deuterated samples shows that there are slight differences between the two signals. These alterations may be caused by differences in the protein environments of the D+ and Z+ radicals."
https://openalex.org/W1548432549,"Human aminoacylase-1 (N-acyl-L-amino-acid amidohydrolase, EC 3.5.1.14; ACY1) is a homodimeric zinc-binding enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of N alpha-acylated amino acids. ACY1 has been assigned to chromosome 3p21.1, a region reduced to homozygosity in small cell lung cancer (SCLC), and has been reported to exhibit reduced or absent expression in SCLC cell lines and tumors. Two human cDNA libraries and one human genomic DNA library were screened with a previously isolated partial ACY1 cDNA to isolate a full-length transcript. Sequence analysis of clones from each of these libraries resulted in an ACY1 cDNA of 1438 base pairs with an open reading frame of 1224-base pairs coding for a putative protein of 408 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 45,882 Da. Sequence analysis revealed no homologies to previously reported cDNA or protein sequences and establishes ACY1 as the first member of a new family of zinc-binding enzymes to be so characterized. The subcellular location of ACY1 has been established as cytosolic by flow cytometry. Southern and northern analyses of ACY1 in SCLC cell lines failed to demonstrate any gross abnormalities of the ACY1 structural gene or instances of absent or aberrantly sized mRNA, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W1609043222,"Abstract Information on cation occlusion sites of renal NA,K-ATPase has been obtained by comparing the ability of competitive Na-like antagonists (David, P., Mayan, H., Cohen, H., Tal, D. M., and Karlish, S. J. D. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 1141-1149) with that of transported alkali metal cations to protect against covalent modification and structural perturbations of the protein. Sodium antagonists include p- or m-xylylenebisguanidium, guanidinium ions, and ethylenediamine. Experiments with proteoliposomes reconstituted with Na,K-ATPase demonstrate that p-xylylenebisguanidium has pronounced selectivity for the cytoplasmic surface. Tryptic digestion of Na,K-ATPase leading to membranes, a specifically truncated enzyme with intact cation occlusion sites, requires the presence of alkali metal cations. Sodium antagonists do not protect 19-kDa membranes against further digestion, and occlusion is destroyed. Incubation of 19-kDa membranes at 37 degrees C, in the absence of occluded ions, leads rapidly to loss of ability to occlude rubidium ions. Rubidium, sodium, or other alkali metal cations protect fully, whereas sodium antagonists do not protect against this thermal inactivation. Like the alkali metal cations, sodium antagonists protect Na,K-ATPase and, somewhat less effectively, 19-kDa membranes against inactivation by the carboxyl reagent N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide. Cation occlusion from the cytoplasmic surface is suggested to occur in two steps. In an initial recognition, either transported cations or sodium antagonists interact with carboxyl groups. The second step is selective for transported cations and involves occlusion of cations (either potassium or sodium ions) and a conformational change to a compact structure, which is resistant to proteolysis and thermal inactivation. Sodium antagonists are sterically hindered from becoming occluded and block Na,K-ATPase activity. Implications for the structural basis of cation specificity of the Na/K pump are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1511840999,"Abstract We characterized six novel missense mutations in mitochondrial cytochrome b (C133Y, W142R, S206L, M221K, L282F, and G340E) which impair the respiratory growth of yeast and which have differential effects on the functioning and assembly of the bc1 complex. The mutations have been mapped genetically in exons of the mitochondrial gene coding for apocytochrome b and their nucleotide sequence established. The mutants help to better define the topographical and primary sequence location of the ubiquinol oxidase (center P) and ubiquinone reductase (center N) sites on cytochrome b. Two mutants (C133Y and S206L) resulted in an active assembled complex, with selective disturbances of heme 565 and heme 562, respectively, which is consistent with the assignment of the axial ligands of these hemes; the C133Y mutation induced myxothiazol resistance, whereas the S206L did not modify the antimycin binding site, although perturbing the center N. These two amino acid replacements, along with those described elsewhere (Tron, T., and Lemesle-Meunier, D. (1990) Curr. Genet. 18, 413-419), constitute a novel class of mutants exhibiting appreciable electron transfer activity, despite their impaired ability to grow on respiratory substrates, raising the possibility that these mutants carry alleles which result in decoupling of proton translocation from electron transfer. Mutants W142R and M221K had an inactive but well assembled bc1 complex, whereas the G34OE and L282F mutations impaired the assembly of the bc1 complex."
https://openalex.org/W1509049175,"Using rabbit serum raised against a potent T cell-stimulating antigen fraction of Leishmania chagasi promastigotes, we have cloned and expressed the Leishmania type 2C serine/threonine protein phosphatase, LcPP2C. LcPP2C was shown to be present as a 42-kDa protein in both the infective promastigote and tissue amastigote stages of L. chagasi and Leishmania amazonensis. DNA hybridization studies established the close conservation of LcPP2C among eight of eight geographically diverse species of Leishmania which cause a spectrum of human diseases. To support the relationship between LcPP2C and mammalian type 2C protein phosphatases observed through predicted amino acid sequence comparisons, we expressed enzymatically active rLcPP2C in Escherichia coli. We demonstrated that purified rLcPP2C readily dephosphorylated [32P]casein, an activity dependent on Mg2+ and insensitive to okadaic acid. In agreement with studies of rat liver PP2C, activity was maintained when Mg+2 was replaced with Mn+2 but not with Ca2+. As these parameters are characteristic of the eukaryotic type 2C serine/threonine protein phosphatases, LcPP2C can be classified as a member of this protein family. We further showed that of the four major classes of eukaryotic serine/threonine protein phosphatases, PP2C-and PP1-like activities, are readily detectable in Leishmania."
https://openalex.org/W1558521552,"Three new, highly similar peptides from the skin secretion of Xenopus laevis have been purified and analyzed by mass spectrometry and Edman degradation. The 66-amino-acid peptides, termed xenoxin-1, -2, and -3, contain 8 cysteines and show similarity to snake venom cytotoxins and short neurotoxins. Assignment of two out of four disulfide bonds suggests a tertiary structure similar to that of cytotoxins and short neurotoxins. A cDNA encoding pre-xenoxin-1 was isolated from a X. laevis skin cDNA library. The nucleotide sequence predicts the synthesis of a precursor with a signal peptide followed by the sequence of the mature peptide. Xenoxin-1 and -2 lack alpha-neurotoxic activity, have apparently no antibacterial activity, are low in general toxicity as tested in mice, and have no effect on blood coagulation as measured in a Factor VIII procoagulant activity test. Potential functions of xenoxins as well as evolutionary aspects are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1537025841,"The neurokinin-1 (NK-1) and neurokinin-2 (NK-2) receptors are both members of the tachykinin receptor family. Although both receptors bind peptide ligands synthesized from common precursors and activate inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate and cAMP responses, differences between these receptors have been observed in the extent and kinetics of agonist-induced responses. Here, to test if structurally homologous domains of the NK-1 and NK-2 receptors are functionally distinct, stably transfected Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell lines expressing receptors that had either their putative third cytoplasmic loop (C3) or carboxyl tail (CT) domains replaced with the equivalent domain of the other receptor were compared with stably transfected CHO cell lines expressing wild-type receptors. Radioligand binding demonstrated that each of these chimeric receptors had agonist binding affinities indistinguishable from wild-type receptors. However, not all chimeric receptors were equivalent in their ability to stimulate inositol phospholipid turnover and cAMP production. The data suggest that the NK-1 C3 and the NK-2 CT domains play important roles in G-protein activation that cannot be replaced by the analogous domain of the other receptor. The characterization of CHO cell lines expressing truncated forms of both receptors supported the hypothesis that the CT domain of the NK-2, but not the NK-1, receptor plays a critical role in G-protein activation. The data suggest a potential mechanism for the differences observed in response characteristics in tissues expressing NK-1 and NK-2 receptors and demonstrate that the mechanisms whereby highly homologous receptors activate G-proteins can be different."
https://openalex.org/W1574964524,"Nerve growth factor-gamma (NGF-gamma) is a serine proteinase which reversibly associates with the well characterized neurotrophin NGF-beta. In this study, we demonstrated that NGF-gamma cleaves recombinant single chain urokinase-type plasminogen activator (scu-PA), converting the zymogen into a two-chain form (tcu-PA). The apparent masses of the two u-PA chains were 33 and 22 kDa, as determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). There was no evidence for secondary cleavage sites or further digestion of tcu-PA by NGF-gamma, even when conversion of scu-PA was complete. The NH2-terminal sequence of the 33-kDa band was Ile-Ile-Gly-Gly-Glu, indicating that NGF-gamma cleaved scu-PA at Lys158-Ile159, the plasmin cleavage site. Cleavage of scu-PA by NGF-gamma resulted in scu-PA activation. The kcat and Km for this reaction, as determined in a continuous assay with the tcu-PA-specific substrate L-pyroglutamyl-glycyl-arginine-p-nitroanilide hydrochloride (S-2444), were (4.1 +/- 0.6) x 10(-2) s-1 and 2.3 +/- 0.4 microM, respectively. The catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) for scu-PA activation by NGF-gamma was 1.3 x 10(4) M-1 s-1, compared with 6.2 x 10(5) M-1 s-1 for the activation of scu-PA by plasmin. NGF-gamma-cleaved scu-PA which was bound to receptors on U937 monocytoid cells. The apparent masses of the resulting u-PA cleavage products were identical to those generated in solution as determined by SDS-PAGE. Cell-associated scu-PA was activated by NGF-gamma, as determined by the generation of activity against the tcu-PA-specific fluorogenic substrate, glutamyl-glycyl-arginine-7-amino-4-methyl coumarin. By activating scu-PA, NGF-gamma may initiate the u-PA-dependent cell-surface proteinase cascade and support NGF-beta activities which involve cellular migration and/or extracellular matrix remodeling."

Transfection of this mutant v-abl into the IC2.9 cell line, generated the IC.DP subclone which was dependent on IL-3 for survival at 39 degrees C, but not at 32 degrees C. Furthermore, IC.DP cells cultured at 32 degrees C exhibited IL-3-independent thymidine incorporation, which was not apparent at 39 degrees C. Switching cells from the restrictive to the permissive temperature resulted in an increase in cellular inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate, choline phosphate and diacylglycerol levels in the IC.DP cell line. These increases were only observed after a lag period of 4 h. Within 2 h of switching IC.DP cells previously maintained at 32 to 39 degrees C, there was a significant decrease in all three metabolites. Temperature switches had no effect upon these metabolites in the parent IC2.9 cell line. Down-regulation of protein kinase C inhibited v-abl-stimulated DNA synthesis in IC.DP cells cultured at 32 degrees C. IC.DP cells cultured at 32 degrees C were found to have a constitutively activated Na+/H+ antiport, although this activation was inhibited by the down-modulation of protein kinase C. These data indicate a role for phospholipid hydrolysis and protein kinase C activation in V-ABL-mediated abrogation of IL-3 dependence."
https://openalex.org/W1558964207,"The 32-kDa topoisomerase I encoded by vaccinia virus relaxes supercoiled DNA in a manner which is mechanistically equivalent to that utilized by eucaryotic enzymes. Its amino acid sequence contains significant homology to the enzymes encoded by Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Saccharomyces pombe, human cells, and other poxviruses. The small size of the viral enzyme, and its essentiality in the viral life cycle, make it ideally suited for structural and functional analysis. In this report we present the construction and analysis of 15 mutant alleles of the topoisomerase containing amino acid substitutions in a highly conserved region. The enzymes encoded by these alleles were expressed in Escherichia coli and various parameters of their activity were examined. All of the alleles which show diminished (seven alleles) or abrogated (three alleles) DNA relaxation activity are deficient in DNA cleavage and the concomitant formation of the covalent enzyme/DNA intermediate. None are deficient in the prior step of noncovalent interaction with substrate DNA. Five of the mutant enzymes show significant temperature sensitivity in vitro. The extent of in vitro activity of the enzymes shows a good but incomplete correlation with the enzymes' abilities to lethally induce the resident lambda prophage within E. coli BL21(DE3) (via illegitimate recombination). Mutations in 1 amino acid, in particular, impair prophage induction in vivo more significantly than DNA relaxation in vitro. In sum, these studies suggest that this region of the topoisomerase (amino acids 216-225) plays a proximal role in mediating DNA cleavage and the covalent interaction between the 3'-phosphoryl of the nicked DNA and tyrosine 274 of the vaccinia topoisomerase I. The studies also provide useful reagents for the molecular genetic analysis of the role of the topoisomerase within the context of vaccinia virus infection."

The expressed wild-type (WT) and the mutant (Del 24 and Del 30) enzymes were purified to homogeneity. These enzymes were homodimers of subunit M(r) values 54,000, 51,300, and 50,600. Deletion of 1-24 and 1-30 residues resulted in over 70% loss of Fru-6-P,2-kinase activity and 2-fold increase in Fru-2,6-bisphosphatase. KmFru-6-P increased 7.5-fold, but there was no significant change in KmFru-2,6P2 of the phosphatase. These mutant enzymes were more susceptible to protein concentration-dependent dissociation and thermal inactivation. In 2 M urea the kinase and the phosphatase activities of WT increased 17 and 56%, respectively, but no activation of any of the mutant enzymes was observed. At higher urea concentrations, all the enzymes were inactivated. Unfolding in urea, followed with intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence, showed that the unfolding proceeded in at least two stages. Fluorescence intensity at 338 nm of all these enzymes decreased below 2 M urea in which the enzyme activities remained the same (Del 24) or activated (WT). The second stage of unfolding was seen as the maximum shifted to 342 nm in 2-4 M urea, presumably involving dissociation. Complete unfolding above 4 M urea resulted in further shift in fluorescence maximum to 350 nm."
https://openalex.org/W1576884682,"Lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) increases extracellularly during ischemia in vivo in both animals and man as judged by measurements from venous effluents, but more recent studies have shown little or no increase in buffer-perfused, isolated heart preparations. The appearance of LPC in blood and lymph in animals and in venous effluents in man in response to ischemia suggests a vascular site for the production of LPC. The present study was performed to assess whether thrombin could stimulate phospholipase A2 in endothelial cells and whether this would evoke an increase in and release of LPC. Endothelial cells were disassociated from canine aortas by incubating with 0.1% collagenase for 20 min. Cells were plated and allowed to grow to confluence. Measurement of LPC was performed using Bligh and Dyer extraction of lipids, high performance liquid chromatography separation, and quantification of LPC using a recently developed radiometric assay employing [3H]acetic anhydride. Incubation of endothelial cells with thrombin (0.05 unit/ml) resulted in a 2.5-fold increase in LPC to 2.3 +/- 0.1 nmol/mg of protein at 2 min (p < 0.01) and returned to control levels within 20 min. The increase in LPC induced by thrombin exhibited a concentration-dependent response with an ED50 = 0.04 unit/ml. A concentration-dependent increase in LPC was also elicited by stimulation with the peptide portion of the thrombin receptor's tethered ligand SFLLRNPNDKYEPF with an ED50 = 8 microM. The LPC produced was rapidly and completely released into the surrounding media. Hirudin completely blocked the thrombin-induced increase in LPC. Dansylarginine N-(3-ethyl-1,5-pentanediyl)amide (0.1 microM), which rapidly inactivates thrombin's proteolytic activity in situ without impairing binding, or phenyl-prolyl-arginyl-chloromethyl ketone (PPACK, 5 nM), which inactivates thrombin due to chemical alteration of the proteolytic site, each prevented the increase in LPC in response to thrombin. Stimulation of protein kinase C with phorbol 12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA, 1 microM) enhanced the response to thrombin. In contrast, staurosporine (100 nM), H7 (15 microM), or chronic treatment with PMA for 20 h to down-regulate protein kinase C completely prevented the increase in LPC in response to thrombin. Thus, thrombin stimulation of endothelial cells in vivo during ischemia may be a primary mechanism contributing to the marked increase in LPC extracellularly during ischemia."

Western blot analysis showed lower levels of the endoprotease PC1/3 in INS cells than in beta cells, as well as a 4-fold reduction in the ratio of PC1/3 to PC2, thus supporting the hypothesis that PC1/3 is the endoprotease responsible for cleavage at the B-chain/C-peptide junction."
https://openalex.org/W1607543426,"The receptors for tumor necrosis factor (TNF) are represented by two transmembrane proteins, p55TNFR and p75TNFR, which are members of a family of cell surface molecules, including the Fas antigen, CD30, CD40, OX40, a Shope fibroma virus protein, and the low affinity p75 nerve growth factor receptor. A common structural feature is a sequence of 40 amino acids that is found in adjacent repeated domains, with 6 cysteine residues in a conserved register. To assess the functional significance of this cysteine-rich domain (CRD), we have constructed chimeric receptors between each TNF receptor and the low affinity nerve growth factor receptor. The chimeric receptor cDNAs were expressed efficiently in COS-1 and 3T3 fibroblasts, as assessed by affinity cross-linking, cell surface biotinylation and immunoprecipitation, and equilibrium binding. Receptors with two CRD of either TNF receptor were incapable of binding TNF, whereas receptors with all four CRD retained the ability to bind TNF with wild type affinity. These results, in conjunction with previous deletion mutation studies, suggest that TNF binding to each receptor requires all four cysteine-rich repeats. Furthermore, analysis of chimeric receptors containing domains of p55TNFR suggests that cytoplasmic sequences directly influence the levels of receptor expression."
https://openalex.org/W1517682817,"The rate of K+ binding to fluorescein 5'-isothiocyanate-modified Na+,K(+)-ATPase has been measured by stopped-flow fluorometry and shown to depend sigmoidally on potassium concentration. By assuming two K+ ions must bind to cause a rate-limiting conformational change, analytical expressions for the rate and the amplitude were derived that fit the experimental data and correctly calculate the half-maximum K+ concentration in amplitude titrations from kinetically estimated rate and dissociation constants. This is the first time that sigmoidal dependence of the time constant for K+ reaction with Na+,K(+)-ATPase on potassium concentration has been observed. The conclusion that two K+ ions are required to cause the E1–>E2 conformational change explains discrepancies between equilibrium and kinetic estimates of the half-maximum K+ concentration in published studies of the reaction and reconciles the mechanism of the conformational change in Na+,K(+)-ATPase with the transport stoichiometry of sodium pump. It is strong, additional evidence that fluorescein reports a conformational change in dephosphoenzyme that is involved in monovalent cation transport. The ratio of the K+ dissociation constants is consistent either with ordered binding to two sites with intrinsic constants differing by a factor of 4 or with binding to two independent and identical sites."
https://openalex.org/W1581434042,"Prothrombin contains two kringle domains, a structural motif common to other plasma proteins involved in hemostasis and fibrinolysis. To determine the role of the kringle domains of prothrombin, we prepared three recombinant human prothrombin forms lacking the first kringle domain (residues 63-144; PT/delta K1), the second kringle domain (residues 144-249; PT/delta K2), or both kringle domains (63-249; PT/delta K1,2). The isolated prothrombin proteins were greater than 95% pure by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and were well carboxylated. PT/delta K1 displayed 50% of the specific coagulant activity of plasma prothrombin, PT/delta K2 had 10% of the specific coagulant activity, and PT/delta K1,2 was inactive. Polyclonal antibodies directed against the Ca(II)-specific conformer of prothrombin bound PT/delta K1 and PT/delta K2 with the same affinity as prothrombin, indicating that the Ca(II)-induced conformational transition does not involve sites on the prothrombin kringle domains. Gel filtration studies demonstrated that radiolabeled plasma prothrombin and all of the prothrombin kringle deletion mutants bound to phospholipid vesicles in the presence of Ca(II) but not in the presence of Mg(II) or EDTA. Relative dissociation constants of 1.10 +/- 0.75 and 0.49 +/- 0.18 microM were obtained by quasielastic light scattering for the interaction of phospholipid vesicles with plasma prothrombin and PT/delta K1, respectively. These data indicate that neither the first nor the second kringle domain contain unique sites for the interaction of prothrombin with phospholipid vesicles and are not required for prothrombin-phospholipid binding."

https://openalex.org/W1556235639,"New gene therapy methods are rapidly being developed to permit the expression of tumor suppressor genes, cytotoxins, anticancer antigens, and immunoregulatory proteins in the treatment of cancer. Large-scale testing in humans has been delayed by questions concerning the safety and effectiveness of preferred retroviral vectors and helper cells. These vector systems are limited by their ability to undergo homologous recombination with endogenous retroviruses or helper-viral sequences, resulting in release of replication-competent retrovirus (RCR). In addition, transcriptional inactivation of the retroviral promoter often occurs, caused in part by methylation of CpG islands in the retroviral long terminal repeats (LTRs). We report the production of highly specific retrovectors using gene amplification together with oligonucleotide building blocks. The synthetic vectors were based on mouse VL30 retrotransposon NVL3, and lacked homology to retroviral helper gene sequences. Three of four constructs made by gene amplification yielded biologically active vectors. These constructs efficiently transmitted and stably inserted a neomycin resistance marker gene into the genome of recipient cells, expressing an abundant RNA species of the expected size in the absence of detectable replication competent retrovirus. The vectors and techniques described enable widely applicable expression modes using generic helper cells, and require only approximately 1.3 kb of cis-acting vector RNA sequences for faithful transfer and expression of genetic material."
https://openalex.org/W1605711476,"A preparation of pig kidney Na+,K(+)-ATPase showed changes in fluorescence energy transfer between probes bound to the alpha-subunit. Excitation (305 nm) of an N-(p-(2-benzimidazolyl)phenyl)maleimide (BIPM) probe, which was covalently bound to Cys-964, and excitation (470 nm) of a fluorescein 5'-isothiocyanate (FITC) probe at Lys-501 gave different FITC fluorescence intensity changes at 520 nm in BIPM-FITC doubly labeled enzyme accompanying formation of reaction intermediates. Addition of acetyl phosphate to a Na(+)-bound enzyme (NaE1) to accumulate acetate-sensitive phosphoenzyme (E1P) induced a faster and greater FITC fluorescence decrease when excited at 470 nm than at 305 nm. An oligomycin-sensitive transition of E1P to K(+)-sensitive phosphoenzyme (E2P) was also accompanied by a larger FITC fluorescence decrease when excited at 470 nm. The addition of K+ to [32P]E2P to form a K(+)-bound enzyme (KE2) induced a rapid dephosphorylation (140/s) with both a slow rate of FITC fluorescence increase and a larger fluorescence increase when excited at 470 nm. The addition of Na+ to KE2 induced both a slow increase of FITC fluorescence and a larger fluorescence increase when excited at 470 nm. The data suggest that fluorescence energy transfer from the BIPM to the FITC probe accompanies the processes of migration of Na+ and K+ in the pump molecules. The dynamic fluorescence changes after phosphorylation and dephosphorylation seem to reflect changes in the binding state or the process of migration of these ions."
https://openalex.org/W1584594367,"gamma delta Resolvase is a site-specific recombinase (20.5 kDa) that catalyzes the resolution of a negatively supercoiled plasmid to a catenated pair of circular DNA products (Reed, R. R. (1981) Cell 25, 713-719). Cross-linking experiments and size exclusion high pressure liquid chromatography analysis of isolated fragments corresponding to specific proteolytic cleavage indicate that the intact enzyme and the large fragment exist in a monomer-dimer equilibrium (KDdimer = 8.0 microM, intact enzyme; KDdimer = 0.1 microM, large fragment) and that the small fragment, which displays DNA binding specificity, is a monomer. Dimerization is further supported by line width comparisons in one-dimensional NMR spectra and determinations of the correlation time of the protein. The one-dimensional proton NMR spectra spectroscopy spectra indicate that the overall structure of the two isolated fragments is highly similar to the structure present in the domains of the intact enzyme. The rotational correlation time of resolvase, determined from relaxation data obtained from each domain, indicates that the small domain has a limited degree of additional motion with respect to the large domain of the enzyme. The monomer-dimer equilibrium and small domain mobility may assist in the binding of resolvase to palindromic-type sites with variable spacers and in subunit exchange during catalysis."
https://openalex.org/W1548326995,"Phosphorylation of threonine 1336 of the human insulin receptor (HIR) is stimulated by insulin or 4 beta-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) transfectant cells expressing the wild type receptor (CHO/HIR). To examine the role of this phosphorylation in insulin signal transduction, a mutant human insulin receptor, in which threonine 1336 was replaced with asparagine, has been stably expressed in CHO cells (CHO/HIRT1336N). CHO cell lines expressing equivalent numbers of the wild type or the mutant receptor were developed, which bound 125I-insulin comparably (Kd = 0.1 nM). After stimulation of CHO/HIR or CHO/HIRT1336N cells with insulin, the wild type and mutant receptors internalized the hormone and were down-regulated with similar rates. Hormone stimulation of the receptor tyrosine kinase activity was also unaffected by the mutation. Metabolic and mitotic effects of insulin were also unimpaired by the mutation. Thus, insulin stimulated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity, glycogen synthesis, and thymidine incorporation into DNA similarly in CHO/HIR and CHO/HIRT1336N cells. These data suggest that by itself phosphorylation of threonine 1336 has no significant effect on insulin binding, regulation of insulin receptor expression, or insulin signal transduction."
https://openalex.org/W1514938557,"Abstract Previous in vivo studies have identified a prominent 4'-demethylepipodophyllotoxin-9-(4,6-O-thionylidine-beta-D-g lucopyranoside) (VM-26)-induced double-stranded topoisomerase II cleavage site at approximately +80 relative to the start of Drosophila hsp70 transcription (Kroeger, P. E., and Rowe, T. C. (1992) Biochemistry 31, 2492-2502). Topoisomerase II binding at this site correlated with the repression of hsp70 transcription suggesting that this protein-DNA interaction was important in the regulation of hsp70 gene expression. In this paper, we investigated the interaction of purified Drosophila topoisomerase II with a 271-base pair DNA fragment containing the +80 region of the hsp70 gene using the topoisomerase II-specific inhibitor VM-26. VM-26-induced topoisomerase II cleavage of the hsp70 DNA resulted in a major 4-base staggered double-stranded break at +84. In the absence of ATP the +84 site was the only significant VM-26-induced cleavage site. Addition of ATP to the reaction resulted in a stimulation of topoisomerase cleavage throughout the 271-base pair DNA fragment. Deletion analyses determined that approximately 15 to 25 bp of flanking sequence were required for efficient cleavage at most topoisomerase II sites within the hsp70 DNA. However, in the case of the +84 site, topoisomerase cleavage still occurred even when this site was split in half by the restriction enzyme PstI. Topoisomerase II cleavage of both DNA molecules occurred at the correct positions on the 4-base single-stranded DNA overhangs generated by PstI. Cleavage was reversible indicating that topoisomerase II could reseal the single-stranded DNA break formed in each half-site substrate. Denaturation of the half-site molecules abolished topoisomerase II cleavage suggesting that cleavage required the duplex region adjacent to the single-stranded cleavage site. Identification of this unusual half-site substrate provides additional evidence that double-stranded cleavage of DNA by topoisomerase II occurs via two sequential single-stranded breaks."
