Akt2/PKBβ, one of three known mammalian isoforms of Akt/PKB, has been demonstrated recently to be required for at least some of the metabolic actions of insulin (Cho, H., Mu, J., Kim, J. K., Thorvaldsen, J. L., Chu, Q., Crenshaw, E. B., Kaestner, K. H., Bartolomei, M. S., Shulman, G. I., and Birnbaum, M. J. (2001) Science292, 1728–1731). Here we show that mice deficient in another closely related isoform of the kinase, Akt1/PKBα, display a conspicuous impairment in organismal growth. Akt1−/− mice demonstrated defects in both fetal and postnatal growth, and these persisted into adulthood. However, in striking contrast to Akt2/PKBβ null mice, Akt1/PKBα-deficient mice are normal with regard to glucose tolerance and insulin-stimulated disposal of blood glucose. Thus, the characterization of the Akt1 knockout mice and its comparison to the previously reported Akt2 deficiency phenotype reveals the non-redundant functions of Akt1 andAkt2 genes with respect to organismal growth and insulin-regulated glucose metabolism.

Nonetheless, much uncertainty remains concerning how this signaling pathway diverges to allow independent regulation of such disparate biological outputs as metabolism, aging, and growth. The serine-threonine kinase Akt, also known as protein kinase B (PKB),1 represents an important mediator of insulin action in worms and flies. InCaenorhabditis elegans, mutations in Akt result in alterations in development and aging whereas in flies, Akt/PKB, as well as other components of the insulin signaling pathway, has been implicated as critical regulators of organism growth and longevity (1Bohni R.

Science. 2001; 292: 104-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (1100) Google Scholar). In rodents and humans, the three isoforms Akt1/PKBα, Akt2/PKBβ, and Akt3/PKBγ, which share a high degree of sequence homology, are encoded by distinct genes (7Coffer P.J. Jin J. Woodgett J.R. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (964) Google Scholar, 8Murthy S.S. Tosolini A. Taguchi T. Testa J.R. Cytogenet. Cell Genet. 2000; 88: 38-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Preliminary analyses of the three gene products support the notion that these isoforms have similar biochemical characteristics (7Coffer P.J. Jin J. Woodgett J.R. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (964) Google Scholar). In mice, one of these Akt/PKB family members, Akt2/PKBβ, has been shown to be required for insulin to maintain normal glucose homeostasis (9Cho H. Mu J. Kim J.K. Thorvaldsen J.L. Chu Q. Crenshaw 3rd, E.B. Kaestner K.H. Bartolomei M.S. Shulman G.I. Birnbaum M.J. Science. 2001; 292: 1728-1731Crossref PubMed Scopus (1518) Google Scholar). In the absence of Akt2/PKBβ, insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in muscle and fat was significantly reduced in association with reduction in whole body glucose disposal. However, the blockade in glucose uptake in response to insulin was incomplete, raising the possibility other PI 3-kinase-dependent effectors, including other Akt isoforms, might also signal to metabolism outputs. To determine whether the highly related Akt1/PKBα is also required for insulin-regulated glucose homeostasis in mice, we disrupted the c-Akt gene (hereafter referred as Akt1), which encodes Akt1/PKBα. To map the Akt1locus and derive DNA fragments for homologous recombination, we screened a mouse genomic BAC library by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The targeting vector was constructed by inserting a left arm fragment, which included exons 2 and 3, into KpnI andXbaI sites and a right arm fragment, which extended from within exon 8 to downstream of exon 11, into the XhoI site of pPNT (10Tybulewicz V.L. Crawford C.E. Jackson P.K. Bronson R.T. Mulligan R.C. Cell. 1991; 65: 1153-1163Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1156) Google Scholar). After transfection of the targeting vector into E14 embryonic stem (ES) cells, G418- and ganciclovir-resistant colonies were screened for homologous recombination by Southern blot analysis. ES cells carrying a recombinant allele were injected into C57BL/6 blastocysts, which were subsequently implanted into pseudopregnant CD-1 foster mothers. Resulting chimeric males were mated with C57BL/6 females to assess germ line transmission as determined by the birth ofagouti pups, which were screened for the targeted allele. For genotyping by PCR, the following primers were used in a single reaction: 851, 5′-AGCTCTTCTTCCACCTGTCTC-3′; 852, 5′-GCTCCATAAGCACACCTTCAGG-3′; 853, 5′-GTGGATGTGGAATGTGTGCGAG-3′. For genotyping by Southern blotting, a PCR-amplified fragment (∼400 base pairs) corresponding to sequence upstream of the left homologous recombination region (Fig. 1) was random labeled with [32P]dCTP. After timed matings of heterozygous Akt1 parents, embryos were harvested at 13.5 days postcoitus. Embryos were dissected to remove the head and the visceral organs and were then finely minced and trypsinized before being plated in the presence of 10% fetal bovine serum in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Glucometer Elite (Bayer) was used to determine glucose concentration from whole blood collected from the transversely sectioned tip of mouse tails. Sera were separated from whole blood for the determination of circulating insulin and free fatty acid concentration. For insulin levels, rat insulin enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was performed by the Radioimmunoassay Core Facility at the Penn Center for Diabetes. NEFA C kit (Wako) was used to determine free fatty acid levels. The targeting strategy for disruption of the Akt1 gene consisted of replacement of the coding exons 4, 5, 6, and 7 and the 5′ portion of exon 8 with the neomycin resistance gene (Fig.1a). Exon 5 encodes the lysine residue necessary for the catalytic activity of Akt1/PKBα. The genotype of the ES cells and animals were easily distinguished by Southern blotting or PCR (Fig. 1, b and c). Mouse embryonic fibroblasts heterozygous and homozygous for the targeted allele were isolated and examined for the presence of Akt1/PKBα mRNA and protein by Northern and Western blot, respectively. BothAkt1 mRNA and protein were undetectable in mouse embryonic fibroblasts in which both alleles were targeted (Fig. 1,d and e). Thus, the targeted disruption resulted in a functionally null allele. Furthermore, we could not detect any compensatory increase in the expression of Akt2 orAkt3 in the Akt1−/− mouse embryonic fibroblasts, as assessed by Northern blot analysis (not shown). When mice heterozygous for the targeted Akt1 allele were mated inter se, fewer than expectedAkt1−/− mice were observed 2–3 weeks after birth (Table I). In contrast,Akt1−/− mice appeared with the expected mendelian frequency when 13.5-day-old embryos were examined. Thus, loss of expression of Akt1 resulted in partial lethality occurring some time between midembryonic development and the time of weaning. Careful monitoring of a small number of litters revealed that a significant number of Akt1−/− pups died within the first 3 days of birth, suggesting that the lethality may have occurred during the early neonatal period (data not shown). In all cases, the surviving Akt1−/− pups continued to grow into adulthood and were fertile.Table IObserved genotypic distribution of offsprings from heterozygous matings+/++/−−/−P14-P211463308725.93%58.61%15.45%E13.522542123.68%55.67%21.65% Open table in a new tab The surviving Akt1−/− animals were distinguishable from wild-type animals because of their smaller size. Examination of mice at birth revealed an ∼20% reduction in body weight in Akt1/PKBα-deficient mice compared with wild-type mice (Fig.2a), suggesting that reduction in size occurs during embryonic development. The decrease in body weight was evident throughout postnatal development regardless of sex and persisted into adulthood (Fig. 2b). At 14 months of age, wild type male mice were 37.7 ± 2.2 g whereasAkt1−/− male mice were 27.7 ± 2.0 g. A role for Akt in the determination of cell and compartment size has been established in Drosophila melanogaster, but the present data provide the first indication as to the importance of this kinase in this regard to growth of a mammalian organism (2Verdu J. Buratovich M.A. Wilder E.L. Birnbaum M.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 500-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). In the fruit fly, the role of Akt in cell growth is relevant to its position in the insulin signal transduction pathway, as genetic manipulation of the fly insulin receptor, IRS ortholog Chico, or PI 3-kinase also results in similar alterations in growth (1Bohni R.

Biol. 1999; 9: 1019-1029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Experiments with mice in which signaling through the IGF-1 receptor has been reduced also led to reduction in body weight, although the relative contributions of cell size and cell number have not been established (13Baker J. Liu J.P. Robertson E.J. Efstratiadis A. Cell. 1993; 75: 73-82Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2019) Google Scholar, 14Liu J.P. Baker J. Perkins A.S. Robertson E.J. Efstratiadis A.

Consistent with these data, mice rendered null for IRS-1 or IRS-2, two scaffolding proteins that serve as crucial substrates for the IGF-1 and insulin receptors, also demonstrate defects in growth (16Withers D.J. Burks D.J. Towery H.H. Altamuro S.L. Flint C.L. White M.F. Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 32-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar, 17Araki E. Lipes M.A. Patti M.E. Bruning J.C. Haag 3rd., B.

Satoh S. et al.Nature. 1994; 372: 182-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (893) Google Scholar). Because a conserved signaling pathway exists in which insulin or IGF-1 stimulates Akt activity via docking of PI 3-kinase to a tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS-1 or IRS-1, it is likely that these signaling proteins also represent intermediates in a pathway regulating cell and organismal growth. Interestingly, p70 S6 kinase, which is also activated by insulin but whose precise relationship with Akt remains unclear, also appears to be important for normal growth of both flies and mice (19Shima H. Pende M. Chen Y. Fumagalli S. Thomas G. Kozma S.C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6649-6659Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,20Montagne J. Stewart M.J. Stocker H. Hafen E. Kozma S.C. Thomas G. Science. 1999; 285: 2126-2129Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar). Recently, we have shown that Akt2/PKBβ is critical to the normal control of glucose homeostasis by insulin (9Cho H. Mu J. Kim J.K. Thorvaldsen J.L. Chu Q. Crenshaw 3rd, E.B. Kaestner K.H. Bartolomei M.S. Shulman G.I. Birnbaum M.J. Science. 2001; 292: 1728-1731Crossref PubMed Scopus (1518) Google Scholar). Thus, it was important to also examine the contribution of Akt1/PKBα to metabolism in vivo. As an initial step, we assessed adult mice for an alteration in whole body glucose metabolism by measuring the concentration of blood glucose. As shown in Table II, there was no change in blood glucose under either random-fed conditions or following a 15 h-fast. As a more sensitive measure of insulin resistance, we also measured circulating insulin levels, which also were unchanged in the Akt1−/− mice (Table II). Circulating free fatty acid levels at fed or fasting states were also indistinguishable between the Akt1−/− and wild-type mice, suggesting that lipid metabolism was unaffected by removal of Akt1/PKBα.Table IIConcentrations of circulating metabolites and insulinMalesFemales+/+−/−+/+−/−Fasting glucose (mg/dl)91.7 ± 2.19 (10)91.4 ± 7.6 (9)98.1 ± 3.1 (14)90.3 ± 3.9 (14)Fed glucose (mg/dl)160.7 ± 9.7 (7)180.9 ± 8.3 (7)145.75 ± 2.6 (12)153.1 ± 6.0 (12)Fasting insulin (ng/ml)0.30 ± 0.059 (10)0.28 ± 0.048 (9)0.28 ± 0.022 (13)0.27 ± 0.019 (14)Fasting FFA (meq/liter)0.94 ± 0.076 (8)0.93 ± 0.069 (7)NDNDFed FFA (meq/liter)0.14 ± 0.034 (8)0.14 ± 0.023 (7)NDNDValues are the mean ± S.D. obtained from 4–5-month-old mice.

No comparisons between sex-matched genotypes revealed any statistically significant difference (p < 0.05) byt-test. As a further evaluation of glucose metabolism, we challenged the mice with exogenous glucose and measured circulating levels of the sugar during the ensuing 2 h. The Akt1−/− mice responded as well as the control mice to the glucose load, indicating normal glucose tolerance (Fig.3a). To more directly ascertain insulin responsiveness, the hormone was injected, and the resultant change in blood glucose was measured. Again, theAkt1−/− mice cleared glucose from circulation as efficiently as wild-type control mice (Fig. 3b). These analyses of whole body glucose metabolism indicate that Akt1/PKBα, in marked contrast to Akt2/PKBβ, is not a major effector for insulin-regulated glucose homeostasis. Although the precise distribution of the Akt isoforms among different organs remains somewhat controversial, abundant evidence exists that Akt1/PKBα is expressed in classical insulin target tissues such as liver, muscle, and adipocytes (21Cross D.A.

Chem. 1999; 274: 23858-23867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). For this reason, it is surprising that mice rendered deficient in Akt1/PKBα demonstrate normal glucose homeostasis, at least as ascertained by glucose and insulin tolerance tests. One possibility is that, despite the wide distribution for the expression of Akt1, other isoforms such as Akt2/PKBβ predominate in insulin-responsive tissues, and thus the mouse is relatively tolerant to the loss of Akt1/PKBα in terms of metabolic regulation. The alternative, and in many ways more attractive hypothesis, is that the different Akt isoforms signal to different targets, because of either intrinsic preferences in substrates or localization at distinct intracellular sites. Whatever the mechanism, these data demonstrate quite clearly that genetically Akt1and Akt2 display unique phenotypes, despite the highly conserved protein products they encode. Akt1 is an important regulator of organismal growth, whereas Akt2 is integral to metabolic regulation. It is interesting that this divergence parallels that of IGF-1 and insulin, in which the former serves to control primarily mammalian growth, whereas the latter exists as the most important regulator of metabolism. Nonetheless, in most model systems, both peptides appear quite capable of activating Akt1/PKBα, and thus there is no obvious indication that IGF-1 or insulin would selectively activate distinct Akt isoforms in vivo (25Park B.C. Kido Y. Accili D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 7517-7523Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 26Alessi D.R. Andjelkovic M. Caudwell B. Cron P. Morrice N. Cohen P. Hemmings B.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6541-6551Crossref PubMed Scopus (2476) Google Scholar). In summary, despite remarkable conservation in primary coding sequence and protein sequence, Akt1 and Akt2 serve distinct functions in the mouse as indicated by the phenotypes of mice deficient in expression of each of the two isoforms. Akt1 is most important to the growth of the organism both in uteroand after birth, whereas Akt2 is critical to insulin-dependent control of carbohydrate metabolism. TheAkt1 knockout phenotype, in which mice are reduced in size at birth and remain small throughout life, is reminiscent of rodent models with altered expression in proximal components of insulin and IGF signaling and suggest that these hormones control growth through Akt1/PKBα (14Liu J.P.

We attempted to explain how insulin resistance could be improved by two opposite PPARγ activity states, supraphysiological activation of PPARγ and moderate reduction. We did so by using heterozygous PPARγ-deficient mice and a pharmacological activator of PPARγ in wild-type mice. We show here that supraphysiological activation of PPARγ by TZD markedly increases triglyceride (TG) content of white adipose tissue (WAT), thereby decreasing TG content of liver and muscle, leading to amelioration of insulin resistance at the expense of obesity. Moderate reduction of PPARγ activity by heterozygous PPARγ deficiency decreases TG content of WAT, skeletal muscle, and liver due to increased leptin expression and increase in fatty acid combustion and decrease in lipogenesis, thereby ameliorating HF diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance. Moreover, although heterozygous PPARγ deficiency and TZD have opposite effects on total WAT mass, heterozygous PPARγ deficiency decreases lipogenesis in WAT, whereas TZD stimulate adipocyte differentiation and apoptosis, thereby both preventing adipocyte hypertrophy. This results in a decrease in molecules causing insulin resistance such as free fatty acids (FFA) (15Shulman G.I. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 171-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (2201) Google Scholar) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) α (16Hotamisligil G.S. J. Intern.

We conclude that, although by different mechanisms, both heterozygous PPARγ deficiency and PPARγ agonist improve insulin resistance, which is associated with decreased TG content of muscle/liver and prevention of adipocyte hypertrophy.

Isotonic sodium chloride solution was administered to the controls. Food intake and body weight were measured to assess the effects of leptin administration. Adipose tissue was removed from each animal, fixed in 10% formaldehyde/phosphate-buffered saline, and maintained at 4 °C until used. Fixed specimens were dehydrated, embedded in tissue-freezing medium (Tissue-Tek OCT compound; Miles), and frozen in dry ice and acetone. WAT was cut into 10-µm sections, and the sections were mounted on silanized slides. The adipose tissue was stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Mature white adipocytes were identified by their characteristic multilocular appearance. Total adipocyte areas were traced manually and analyzed with Win ROOF software (Mitani Co., Ltd., Chiba, Japan). White adipocyte areas were measured in 400 or more cells per mouse in each group according to the methods described previously (8Okuno A. Tamemoto H. Tobe K. Ueki K. Mori Y. Iwamoto K. Umesono K.

The radioactivity in each band was quantified, and the fold change in each mRNA was calculated after correction for loading differences by measuring the amount of 28 S rRNA. Very low levels (<10%) of adipocyte P2 mRNA were detected in muscle as compared with those in WAT. By contrast, CD36, SCD1, acyl-CoA oxidase, and UCP2 mRNAs were detected in muscle at levels comparable to those in WAT. These findings suggest that the results for muscle tissue essentially represent the results for the muscle cells, although the muscle was contaminated by a small amount (<10%) of inter-myocyte fat (20Vidal-Puig A.

Representative data from one of three independent experiments are shown. The measurements of [14C]CO2 production from [1-14C]palmitic acid and lipogenesis from [1-14C]acetate were performed using liver, muscle, and WAT slices, as described (18Murakami K. Tobe K. Ide T.

To explain how insulin resistance could be improved by two opposite PPARγ activity states, supraphysiological activation of PPARγ and moderate reduction, we studied the phenotypes of untreated or PPARγ agonist-treated wild-type mice and untreated heterozygous PPARγ-deficient mice. We assessed PPARγ activity in vivoby measuring expression levels of lipoprotein lipase (23Schoonjans K. Peinado-Onsurbe J. Lefebvre A.M. Heyman R.A. Briggs M. Deeb S. Staels B. Auwerx J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5336-5348Crossref PubMed Scopus (1026) Google Scholar), fatty-acid translocase (FAT)/CD36 (24Tontonoz P. Nagy L. Alvarez J.G. Thomazy V.A. Evans R.M. Cell. 1998; 93: 241-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1617) Google Scholar), and adipocyte fatty acid-binding protein/adipocyte P2 (25Tontonoz P. Hu E. Spiegelman B.M. Cell. 1994; 79: 1147-1156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3133) Google Scholar) (Fig.1A), whose promoters contain peroxisome proliferator response element, in WAT, where PPARγ is expressed most predominantly in vivo. As expected, rosiglitazone-treated wild-type mice exhibited a significant increase in PPARγ activity as compared with untreated wild-type mice (Fig.1A, lanes 1 and 2), whereas untreated heterozygous PPARγ-deficient mice showed a moderate decrease in PPARγ activity (Fig. 1A, lanes 1 and3). Untreated wild-type mice on the HF diet gained significantly more body weight than the mice on the HC diet (data not shown). Administration of rosiglitazone to wild-type mice increased significantly more body weight than vehicle on the HF diet (Fig. 1B, lanes 1 and 2). In contrast, heterozygous PPARγ deficiency reduced the increase in body weight on the HF diet (Fig. 1B, lanes 2 and 3). Treatment of wild-type mice with rosiglitazone significantly increased WAT mass (Fig. 1C,lanes 1 and 2), whereas untreated heterozygous PPARγ-deficient mice were protected from HF diet-induced increase in WAT mass (Fig. 1C, lanes 2 and 3). These data suggested that PPARγ determines the adiposity in proportion to its activity. Treatment of wild-type mice with rosiglitazone improved hyperglycemia (Fig. 1D, lanes 1) and hyperinsulinemia (Fig.1E, lane 1) on the HF diet as compared with untreated wild-type mice (Fig. 1, D and E, lane 2). Untreated heterozygous PPARγ-deficient mice were also protected from HF diet-induced hyperglycemia (Fig. 1D, lanes 2 and 3) and hyperinsulinemia (Fig. 1E, lanes 2 and 3). These findings indicate that TZD improve insulin sensitivity at the expense of obesity, whereas moderate reduction of PPARγ activity has potential as anti-obesity and anti-diabetic drugs. The rectal temperature was lower in rosiglitazone-treated wild-type mice than that in untreated wild-type mice (Fig. 2A, lanes 1 and 2); on the contrary, it was significantly higher in untreated heterozygous PPARγ-deficient mice (Fig. 2A, lanes 2 and 3). The serum leptin (26Friedman J.M. Nature. 2000; 404: 632-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar) levels were slightly but not significantly lower in rosiglitazone-treated wild-type mice than those of untreated wild-type mice (Fig. 2B,lanes 1 and 2), whereas they were significantly higher in untreated heterozygous PPARγ-deficient mice (Fig.2B, lanes 2 and 3). Thus the serum leptin levels were parallel to the rectal temperature. It was also noted that serum leptin levels were negatively correlated with PPARγ activity, suggesting that the serum leptin levels were parallel to the repression of leptin gene transcription by PPARγ/RXR (27Hollenberg A.N. Susulic V.S. Madura J.P. Zhang B. Moller D.E. Tontonoz P. Sarraf P. Spiegelman B.M. Lowell B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5283-5290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Moreover, leptin sensitivity as assessed by reductions in food intake and body weight change in response to exogenously administered leptin was significantly increased in heterozygous PPARγ-deficient mice as compared with wild-type mice on the HF diet (Fig. 2C andD, lanes 3–6). The degree of change in body weight induced by leptin treatment differed significantly (p < 0.01) between wild-type (−0.67 ± 0.09%) and heterozygous PPARγ-deficient mice (−1.38 ± 0.11%). These data raised the possibility that increased leptin effects may contribute to the effects of the heterozygous PPARγ deficiency. In WAT from untreated heterozygous PPARγ-deficient mice, expressions of lipoprotein lipase and CD36 were reduced, which may contribute to decreased TG content. In addition, expressions of lipogenic enzymes such as sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) 1c and SCD (stearoyl-CoA desaturase) 1 were reduced, and lipid synthesis was indeed significantly decreased in WAT from heterozygous PPARγ-deficient mice as compared with that in wild-type mice on the HF diet (Fig. 2F). Expression of β3-adrenergic receptor (Fig. 2E, lanes 2 and 3) was increased presumably due to their increased leptin effects (Fig. 2, B–D) (28Soukas A. Cohen P. Socci N.D. Friedman J.M. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 963-980PubMed Google Scholar) and decreased PPARγ/RXR effects (29Bakopanos E. Silva J.E. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 2108-2115Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), and fatty acid oxidation was increased (data not shown). Decreased lipid synthesis and increased fatty acid oxidation as well as presumably decreased fatty acid influx in heterozygous PPARγ-deficient mice may in concert prevent adipocyte hypertrophy (Fig. 3A), and therefore obesity (Fig. 1, B and C, lanes 2 and 3), on the HF diet. Interestingly, supraphysiological activation of PPARγ significantly reduced the average size of adipocytes under the HF diet (Fig.3A, lane 1 and 2) as a result of a marked increase in the number of newly differentiated small adipocytes and significant decrease in the number of large adipocytes with a concomitant induction of apoptosis of adipocyte (Fig. 3B, lanes 1 and 2, and Fig. 3C) (8Okuno A. Tamemoto H. Tobe K. Ueki K. Mori Y. Iwamoto K. Umesono K. Akanuma Y. Fujiwara T. Horikoshi H. Yazaki Y. Kadowaki T. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1354-1361Crossref PubMed Scopus (927) Google Scholar). On the other hand, heterozygous PPARγ deficiency appeared to prevent HF diet-induced adipocyte hypertrophy without a significant change in the total number of adipocytes (Fig. 3B, lanes 2 and3 and Fig. 3C). These data suggest that the heterozygous PPARγ deficiency decreases lipogenesis in WAT, whereas TZD stimulate adipocyte differentiation and apoptosis, thereby both preventing adipocyte hypertrophy. We next attempted to experimentally clarify the relationships between adipocyte hypertrophy and insulin resistance. To this end, we induced adipocyte hypertrophy by high fat feeding, leptin receptor deficiency, or agouti overexpression. The size of the adipose cells and the insulin resistance were increased in mice on a HF diet compared with those in mice on a HC diet (Fig. 3D). The size of the adipose cells and the insulin resistance of db/db mice were also increased compared with their wild-type controls on both the HC and HF diet (Fig. 3D). We obtained essentially similar results by using KKAy mice and their wild-type controls (KK) (Fig. 3E). These findings support a close correlation between adipocyte hypertrophy and insulin resistance, even though a cause and effect relationship is again unproven. In this context, protection from adipocyte hypertrophy due to decreased lipid synthesis in WAT from heterozygous PPARγ-deficient mice (Fig. 2F) may cause an increase in insulin sensitivity (Fig. 3F). We tried to clarify the molecular link between adipocyte hypertrophy and insulin resistance. We examined the levels of expression of molecules secreted by WAT that regulate insulin sensitivity under the following four different conditions: HC feeding, HF feeding, HF feeding with heterozygous PPARγ deficiency, and HF feeding with PPARγ agonist. The HF diet significantly increased adipocyte size and at the same time increased the molecules causing insulin resistance, such as FFA and TNFα (Fig. 3,G and H), and decreased the molecules causing insulin sensitivity, such as adiponectin (Fig. 3I), in mice that exhibited insulin resistance as compared with mice on the HC diet (Fig. 1, D and E, lanes 1 and2). (Replenishment of adiponectin in KKAy mice on the HF diet partially reverses insulin resistance even at the doses that do not significantly change adipocyte size (17Yamauchi T. Kamon J. Waki H. Terauchi Y. Kubota N. Hara K. Mori Y. Ide T. Murakami K. Tsuboyama-Kasaoka N. Ezaki O. Akanuma Y. Gavrilova O. Vinson C. Reitman M.L. Kagechika H. Shudo K. Yoda M. Nakano Y. Tobe K. Nagai R. Kimura S. Tomita M. Froguel P. Kadowaki T. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 941-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (4099) Google Scholar).) In addition, treatment of wild-type mice with the PPARγ agonist rosiglitazone or heterozygous PPARγ deficiency, both of which resulted in protection against HF diet-induced adipocyte hypertrophy, significantly decreased FFA and TNFα (Fig. 3, G and H) and increased adiponectin (Fig. 3I) and at the same time ameliorated insulin resistance (Fig. 1, D and E) on the HF diet. However, treatment of wild-type mice with a PPARγ agonist increased adipose tissue mass (Fig. 1C, lane 1) and body weight (Fig. 1B, lane 1), whereas heterozygous PPARγ deficiency significantly decreased them (Fig. 1,B and C, lane 3). These findings raised the possibility that levels of expression of molecules regulating insulin sensitivity may be more closely related to adipocyte size than PPARγ activity, adipose tissue mass, or body weightin vivo. Large adipocytes are known to be resistant to anti-lipolytic action of insulin, thereby releasing a large amount of FFA (30Askew E.W. Huston R.L. Plopper C.G. Hecker A.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1975; 56: 521-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar); however, the mechanisms underlying the correlation between larger adipocytes and up-regulation of TNFα and/or down-regulation of adiponectin remain to be elucidated. Interestingly, both supraphysiological activation of PPARγ and moderate reduction of PPARγ activity significantly reduced tissue TG content in muscle and liver (Fig.4A and Fig.5A), suggesting that insulin resistance has an excellent correlation with tissue TG content in muscle and liver (Fig. 1, D and E, Fig.4A, and Fig. 5A) (15Shulman G.I. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 171-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (2201) Google Scholar).Figure 5TZDindirectly decreases molecules involved inFFAinflux into the liver, whereas heterozygous PPARγ deficiency combusts fatty acid and decreases lipogenesis, thereby both decreasing tissueTGcontent in liver.

On the other hand, heterozygous PPARγ deficiency reduced expression of lipogenic enzymes such as SCD1 (Fig. 4E and Fig. 5B, lanes 2 and 3) and SREBP 1 (Fig.5B, lanes 2 and 3), and indeed significantly reduced lipogenesis (Fig. 5C), presumably due to increased leptin effects (Fig. 2, B–D) (28Soukas A. Cohen P. Socci N.D. Friedman J.M. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 963-980PubMed Google Scholar), may reduce tissue TG content in muscle/liver (Fig. 4A and Fig.5A, lanes 2 and 3). Moreover, in muscle/liver from heterozygous PPARγ-deficient mice, increased expression of enzymes involved in β-oxidation such as acyl-CoA oxidase and that of molecules involved in energy dissipation such as UCP2 (Fig. 4E and Fig.5B, lanes 2 and 3) were observed. Fatty acid oxidation was indeed significantly increased in muscle/liver from heterozygous PPARγ-deficient mice as compared with that in wild-type mice on the HF diet (Fig. 4F and Fig.5D). These alterations may be an additional mechanism for reduced TG content in muscle/liver of heterozygous PPARγ-deficient mice. Since these effects were recapitulated by treatment of wild-type mice with Wy-14,643, a PPARα agonist as reported (18Murakami K. Tobe K. Ide T. Mochizuki T. Ohashi M. Akanuma Y. Yazaki Y. Kadowaki T.

Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 963-980PubMed Google Scholar) and decreased PPARγ effects (29Bakopanos E. Silva J.E. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 2108-2115Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), were observed. These alterations in concert may provide the mechanism that increased energy expenditure by heterozygous PPARγ deficiency (Fig.2A). Increased tissue TG content has been reported to interfere with insulin-stimulated phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase activation and subsequent GLUT4 translocation and glucose uptake (15Shulman G.I. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 171-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (2201) Google Scholar). Next, we tried to experimentally clarify the relationships between tissue TG content and insulin resistance. To do so, we increased tissue TG content by high fat feeding, leptin receptor deficiency, or agouti overexpression. The tissue TG content of skeletal muscle and insulin resistance were increased in mice on the HF diet compared with those in mice on the HC diet (Fig. 4B). The tissue TG content of skeletal muscle and insulin resistance of db/db mice were also increased compared with their wild-type controls on both the HC and HF diets (Fig.4B). We obtained essentially similar results by using KKAy mice and their wild-type controls (KK) (Fig. 4C). These findings raise the possibility that increases in tissue TG content are associated with insulin resistance. Conversely, decreased tissue TG content due to decreased lipid synthesis and increased fatty acid oxidation in muscle/liver from heterozygous PPARγ-deficient mice (Fig. 4F and Fig. 5, C and D) may cause an increase in insulin sensitivity (Fig. 4D). Shulman and co-workers (32Abel E.D. Peroni O. Kim J.K. Kim Y.B. Boss O. Hadro E. Minnemann T. Shulman G.I. Kahn B.B. Nature. 2001; 409: 729-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (962) Google Scholar) proposed a cause and effect relationship between the accumulation of intracellular fatty acid-derived metabolites and insulin resistance. However, there are instances in which tissue TG content actually does not change in another scenario that also causes insulin resistance, i.e. adipose-selective targeting of the GLUT4 gene (32Abel E.D. Peroni O. Kim J.K. Kim Y.B. Boss O. Hadro E. Minnemann T. Shulman G.I. Kahn B.B. Nature. 2001; 409: 729-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (962) Google Scholar). Thus, interpretation should be done with caution, and decreased tissue TG content in muscle/liver is one possible mechanism for the results of increased insulin sensitivity in heterozygous PPARγ-deficient mice. Consistent with this possibility, decreased TG content in muscle of heterozygous PPARγ-deficient mice indeed improved insulin signal transduction in muscle, as demonstrated by increases in insulin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor, insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-1 and IRS-2, and insulin-stimulated PI3-kinase activity in phosphotyrosine, IRS-1 and IRS-2 immunoprecipitates, and insulin-stimulated Akt activity in skeletal muscle (Fig.4G). The reduction of TG content in liver of heterozygous PPARγ-deficient mice was associated with increased expression of glucokinase and decreased expression of enzymes involved in gluconeogenesis such as phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase and glucose-6-phosphatase (Fig. 5E), indicating increased insulin actions also in liver. We attempted to explain how insulin resistance could be improved by the following two opposite PPARγ activity states: a potent activation of PPARγ and its moderate reduction. We did so by using heterozygous PPARγ-deficient mice and a pharmacological activator of PPARγ in wild-type mice. On the basis of experimental results obtained in this study, we propose the following hypothesis on the mechanisms for the regulation of insulin sensitivity by PPARγ (Fig.7). As shown in the Fig. 7, panel 2, on the HF diet, “normal” amounts of PPARγ activity seen in wild-type mice increase TG content in WAT, skeletal muscle, and liver due to a combination of increased fatty acid influx into WAT, skeletal muscle, and liver and HF diet-induced leptin resistance, leading to insulin resistance and obesity. Moreover, hypertrophic adipocytes may increase the secretion of molecules causing insulin resistance, such as FFA (15Shulman G.I. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 171-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (2201) Google Scholar) and TNFα (16Hotamisligil G.S. J. Intern. Med. 1999; 245: 621-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar), and decrease that of an insulin-sensitizing hormone, such as adiponectin (17Yamauchi T. Kamon J. Waki H. Terauchi Y. Kubota N. Hara K. Mori Y. Ide T. Murakami K. Tsuboyama-Kasaoka N. Ezaki O. Akanuma Y. Gavrilova O. Vinson C. Reitman M.L. Kagechika H. Shudo K. Yoda M. Nakano Y. Tobe K. Nagai R. Kimura S. Tomita M. Froguel P. Kadowaki T. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 941-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (4099) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 7, panel 1, supraphysiological activation of PPARγ way beyond that by TZD stimulates adipogenesis, which promotes a flux of FFA from liver and muscle into WAT, leading to a decrease in TG content in liver and muscle and improvement of insulin sensitivity at the expense of increased WAT mass, i.e.obesity. Moreover, TZD induce adipocyte differentiation and apoptosis, thereby increasing the number of small adipocytes, which finally lead to alleviation of insulin resistance presumably via a decrease in molecules causing insulin resistance, such as FFA and TNFα, and up-regulation of insulin-sensitizing hormone adiponectin, at least in part. By contrast, as shown in the Fig. 7, panel 3, moderate reduction of PPARγ activity observed in untreated heterozygous PPARγ-deficient mice decreases TG content in WAT, skeletal muscle, and liver. This effect is due to a combination of increased leptin expression by antagonism of PPARγ-mediated suppression of the gene, thereby reducing expression of lipogenic enzymes, and consequent activation of PPARα pathway in liver, BAT, and skeletal muscle, leading to an increase in expression of UCP2 and enzymes involved in β-oxidation. These observations fit well with the recently demonstrated effects of PPARα agonists on insulin resistance (33Guerre-Millo M. Gervois P. Raspe E. Madsen L. Poulain P. Derudas B. Herbert J.M.

Gonzalez F.J. Desvergne B. Wahli W. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 1489-1498Crossref PubMed Scopus (1371) Google Scholar). Moreover, direct antagonism of PPARγ to reduce lipogenesis in WAT prevents adipocyte hypertrophy under the HF diet, thereby reducing the molecules causing insulin resistance, such as FFA and TNFα, and up-regulating the insulin-sensitizing hormone adiponectin, at least in part. These alterations lead to prevention against HF diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance. The data showing that moderate reduction of PPARγ activity resulted in increased insulin sensitivity were further confirmed by the observation that treatment of heterozygous PPARγ-deficient mice with a low dose of TZD caused the re-emergence of insulin resistance (9Kubota N. Terauchi Y. Miki H. Tamemoto H. Yamauchi T. Komeda K. Satoh S. Nakano R. Ishii C. Sugiyama T. Eto K. Tsubamoto Y. Okuno A. Murakami K. Sekihara H. Hasegawa G. Naito M. Toyoshima Y. Tanaka S.

This study has thus revealed the mechanisms whereby both PPARγ agonist and heterozygous PPARγ deficiency have a similar effect on insulin sensitivity. However, it should also be noted that PPARγ agonist and heterozygous PPARγ deficiency have an opposite effect on adiposity and energy expenditure which appear to be more directly regulated by PPARγ activity. Although both heterozygous PPARγ deficiency and PPARγ agonist finally improve insulin resistance via decreased TG content in muscle/liver and prevention of adipocyte hypertrophy, there are some important differences between them. First, although both reduced TG content in muscle/liver, heterozygous PPARγ deficiency did so via activation of fatty acid combustion and energy dissipation, whereas TZD did so via potent stimulation of adipogenesis, thereby increasing fatty acid flux from muscle/liver into WAT. Second, both prevented HF diet-induced adipocyte hypertrophy, and TZD markedly increased the number of newly differentiated small adipocytes, whereas heterozygous PPARγ deficiency appeared not to change the total number of adipocytes. Taken together, all of these differences are consistent with the notion that activation of PPARγ plays a role in energy storage and adiposity, and reduction of PPARγ causes energy dissipation and prevention of adiposity. In conclusion, although by different mechanisms, both heterozygous PPARγ deficiency and PPARγ agonist improve insulin resistance via decreased TG content in muscle/liver and prevention of adipocyte hypertrophy (Fig. 7).

We demonstrate that HOCl regulates the activity of matrix metalloproteinase-7 (MMP-7, matrilysin) in vitro, suggesting that this oxidant activates MMPs in the artery wall. Indeed, both MMP-7 and myeloperoxidase were colocalized to lipid-laden macrophages in human atherosclerotic lesions. A highly conserved domain called the cysteine switch has been proposed to regulate MMP activity. When we exposed a synthetic peptide that mimicked the cysteine switch to HOCl, HPLC analysis showed that the thiol residue reacted rapidly, generating a near-quantitative yield of products. Tandem mass spectrometric analysis identified the products as sulfinic acid, sulfonic acid, and a dimer containing a disulfide bridge. In contrast, the peptide reacted slowly with H2O2, and the only product was the disulfide. Moreover, HOCl markedly activated pro-MMP-7, an MMP expressed at high levels in lipid-laden macrophages in vivo. Tandem mass spectrometric analysis of trypsin digests revealed that the thiol residue of the enzyme's cysteine switch domain had been converted to sulfinic acid. Thiol oxidation was associated with autolytic cleavage of pro-MMP-7, strongly suggesting that oxygenation activates the latent enzyme. In contrast, H2O2 failed to oxidize the thiol residue of the protein or activate the enzyme. Thus, HOCl activates pro-MMP-7 by converting the thiol residue of the cysteine switch to sulfinic acid. This activation mechanism is distinct from the well-studied proteolytic cleavage of MMP pro-enzymes.

Nagase H. Matrix Metalloproteinases and TIMPs. Oxford University Press, New York, NY2000Google Scholar). The role of macrophage-derived matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs)1 in mediating plaque rupture in atherosclerosis provides a physiologically relevant example of this process (2Libby P.

Atherosclerotic lesions resistant to rupture are stabilized by a fibrous cap, which separates an intensely pro-coagulant lipid core from the bloodstream. Because the extracellular matrix plays a key structural role in stabilizing this cap, matrix-degrading enzymes, and MMPs, in particular, might contribute to plaque instability (1Woessner J.F.

Indeed, the lipid-laden macrophages that congregate in the shoulder regions of human atherosclerotic lesions express several MMPs: collagenase-1 (MMP-1), stromelysin-1 (MMP-3), and gelatinase B (MMP-9) (6Henney A.M.

In contrast, expression of matrilysin (MMP-7) and macrophage metalloelastase (MMP-12) is confined to lipid-laden macrophages on the border of the acellular lipid cores (9Halpert I. Roby J.D. Sires U.I. Potter-Perigo S. Wight T.N. Welgus H.G. Shapiro S.D. Wickline S.A. Parks W.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9748-9753Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Because pathology studies show that this border region is particularly prone to rupture, dysregulation of MMP activity could represent an important mechanism controlling degradation of structural matrix proteins. Because of its precise location in the artery wall and its broad degradative ability, MMP-7 might be particularly important for triggering tissue disruption and plaque rupture. MMPs are produced in a latent form, and hence the mechanisms that activate pro-MMPs are important steps in regulating matrix degradation in the artery wall (1Woessner J.F. Nagase H.

However, because most MMPs, including pro-MMP-1, -3, -7, and -9, which are expressed by macrophages in atherosclerotic lesions, are not activated by furin proteolysis, other cell-directed mechanisms must convert the latent enzymes into active form. With the exception of MMP-23 (1Woessner J.F. Nagase H. Matrix Metalloproteinases and TIMPs. Oxford University Press, New York, NY2000Google Scholar, 13Velasco G. Pendas A.M. Fueyo A. Knauper V.

The catalytic domain of all MMPs exhibits a metazincin fold that contains an active site zinc that binds to three conserved histidines in the sequence HEXXHXXGXXHS/T(X)5M (1Woessner J.F. Nagase H. Matrix Metalloproteinases and TIMPs. Oxford University Press, New York, NY2000Google Scholar). In an inactive state, the conserved cysteine residue in the pro-domain provides the fourth coordination site for the catalytic zinc ion (14Holz R.C. Salowe S.P. Smith C.K. Cuca G.C. Que L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1992; 114: 9611-9614Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 15Becker J.W. Marcy A.I. Rokosz L.L. Axel M.G. Burbaum J.J. Fitzgerald P.M. Cameron P.M. Esser C.K. Hagmann W.K. Hermes J.D. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 1966-1976Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). This so-called cysteine-switch domain has been proposed to prevent latent enzymes from becoming inappropriately active by binding to the catalytic zinc atom (16Van Wart H.E. Birkedal-Hansen H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5578-5582Crossref PubMed Scopus (1204) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the cysteine residue may act in concert with other residues to control the conformation of the pro-domain, shielding the enzyme's active site from substrate (17Chen L.C. Noelken M.E. Nagase H. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 10289-10295Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In vitro, MMPs become active when proteolytic cleavage releases the pro-domain, exposing the zinc atom and freeing the catalytic site to interact with substrate (1Woessner J.F. Nagase H. Matrix Metalloproteinases and TIMPs. Oxford University Press, New York, NY2000Google Scholar). Although proteolytic activation of MMPs has been widely studied, it is not clear whether this process occurs in vivo or if cleavage of the pro-domain is even required for activity. Many in vitro studies have shown that plasmin can activate latent MMPs, leading to the proposal that this abundant serine proteinase cleaves pro-MMPs in tissues. Indeed, neointimal formation and breakdown of medial lamellar matrix are reduced in injured arteries in plasminogen and urokinase-like plasminogen activator knockout mice crossed with apolipoprotein E-deficient mice (18Carmeliet P. Moons L. Lijnen R. Baes M. Lemaitre V. Tipping P. Drew A. Eeckhout Y. Shapiro S. Lupu F. Collen D. Nat. Genet. 1997; 17: 439-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar, 19Lijnen H.R. Van Hoef B. Lupu F. Moons L. Carmeliet P. Collen D. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1998; 18: 1035-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Because elastin is the main matrix component of aortic lamellae and because this protein polymer is not degraded by plasmin or urokinase-like plasminogen activator, the authors of these studies concluded that elastolytic MMPs, such as MMP-9, are proteolytically activated by these serine proteinases. However, only indirect in vitro evidence was provided to support this idea. Thus, other mechanisms may be involved in pro-MMP activation.

Therefore, this hypohalous acid might activate latent MMPs by covalently modifying the thiol residue of the pro-enzyme's cysteine switch. In the current studies, we demonstrate that HOCl, but not H2O2, oxygenates the thiol residue of the cysteine switch of pro-MMP-7. As the thiol is converted to a sulfinic acid, the pro-enzyme converts to an active form. These observations reveal a molecular mechanism for activating MMPs that is distinct from the generally accepted proteolytic cleavage mechanism. Our findings also suggest that HOCl production by myeloperoxidase might be a physiologically relevant pathway for triggering MMP activation and plaque rupture in the human artery wall. Sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), HEPES, trifluoroacetic acid, and HPLC grade CH3CN were obtained from Fisher Scientific (Pittsburgh, PA). Unless otherwise indicated, all other materials were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO). Human promatrilysin (pro-MMP-7), in 25 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5), 5 mm CaCl2, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.01% Brij35, 0.02% NaN3, was obtained from Chemicon International Inc. (Temecula, CA). To remove Tris (a primary amine that reacts with HOCl), we equilibrated pro-MMP-7 with buffer A (150 mm NaCl, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 5 mmCaCl2) by dialysis (Slide-A-Lyzer Mini dialysis unit, 10,000 molecular weight cutoff, Pierce, Rockford, IL) or by ultrafiltration (Microcon YM-10 centrifugal filter; Millipore, Bedford, MA) before use. Myeloperoxidase (A430/A280 ratio > 0.8) was purified from HL-60 cells by sequential lectin affinity, ion exchange, and size exclusion chromatographies (44Heinecke J.W. Li W. Daehnke 3rd, H.L.

Reactions were carried out for 30 min at 37 °C in buffer A supplemented with 1.5 µmpro-MMP-7 (50 pmol) or 10 µm cysteine switch peptide PRCGVPDVA (Protein and Nucleic Acid Chemistry Laboratory, Washington University). Reactions were initiated by adding oxidant and were terminated by adding a 10-fold molar excess (relative to oxidant) ofl-methionine. Concentrations of HOCl and H2O2 were determined spectrophotometrically (ε292 = 350 m−1cm−1 and ε240 = 39.4m−1 cm−1) (47Morris J.C. J. Phys.

Peptides were separated at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min on a reverse-phase column (Vydac C18 MS, 2.1 × 250 mm) using a Beckman HPLC system (Fullerton, CA) with UV detection at 214 nm. The peptides were eluted using a linear gradient of 15% to 30% CH3CN in 0.04% trifluoroacetic acid over 20 min. Pro-MMP-7 was incubated overnight at 37 °C with sequencing grade-modified trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI) at a ratio of 25:1 (w/w) pro-MMP-7:trypsin in buffer B (10% CH3CN, 50 mm NH4HCO3, pH 8). EDTA (10 mm) was included to block any autolysis by trypsin-activated MMP-7. Digestion was halted by freezing or acidification (pH 2–3) with formic acid or trifluoroacetic acid. LC/MS analyses were performed in the positive ion mode with a Finnigan Mat LCQ ion trap instrument (San Jose, CA) coupled to a Waters 2690 HPLC system (Milford, MA). Peptides were separated at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min on a reverse-phase column (Vydac C18 MS column; 2.1 × 25 mm) using solvent A (0.2% formic acid in water) and solvent B (0.2% formic acid in 80% CH3CN, 20% water). Peptides were eluted using the following linear gradient: 0% to 15% B over 15 min; 15% to 30% B over 25 min; then 30% to 65% B over 20 min. The electrospray needle was held at 4500 V. Nitrogen, the sheath gas, was set at 80 units. The collision gas was helium. The temperature of the heated capillary was 220 °C. The enzymatic activity of pro-MMP-7 was assayed (49Woessner Jr., J.F. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 248: 485-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) for 20 min at 37 °C using the fluorescent synthetic peptide (7-methoxycoumarin-4-acetyl-Pro-Leu-Gly-Leu-β-(2,4-dinitrophenylamino)Ala-Ala-Arg-NH2(Mca peptide, Sigma). Pro-MMP-7 (15–30 ng) was added to individual wells of a 96-well microtiter plate containing 500 µl of buffer C (0.2 m NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm CaCl2, 0.02% NaN3, 0.05% Brij35 (w/v)) and 2 µm Mca peptide. Fluorescence (λex = 328 nm, λem = 392 nm) was monitored using a microplate reader (SPECTRAmax GEMINI XS, Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Control reactions indicated that neither HOCl, methionine, nor other components of the oxidation reactions affected the Mca peptide. Specimens of atherosclerotic carotid endarterectomies (n = 5) were obtained at surgery, fixed, processed for paraffin embedding, and immunostained as described previously (9Halpert I. Roby J.D.

Anti-human matrilysin monoclonal antibody was purchased from Chemicon (MAB13414), used at 1:100 dilution, and detected using an alkaline phosphatase mouse IgG kit and Substrate Kit 3 (Vector Laboratories, Inc., Burlingame, CA).

Sections stained for myeloperoxidase were lightly counterstained with Harris hematoxylin. For negative controls, sections were processed with preimmune serum at comparable dilutions. The cysteine switch domain (PRCXXPD) is found in all known MMPs, except for MMP-23 (1Woessner J.F. Nagase H. Matrix Metalloproteinases and TIMPs. Oxford University Press, New York, NY2000Google Scholar, 13Velasco G. Pendas A.M. Fueyo A. Knauper V. Murphy G. Lopez-Otin C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4570-4576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). To explore its possible involvement in MMP activation by oxidants, we used a synthetic peptide, PRCGVPDVA, which duplicates the switch domain of pro-MMP-7. We exposed the peptide to a 5-fold molar excess of H2O2 or HOCl at 37 °C in neutral buffer containing plasma concentrations of chloride and calcium. HPLC revealed one major peak of new material after H2O2 treatment (Fig.1B, peak 3) but three prominent peaks after HOCl treatment (Fig. 1D;peaks 1, 2, and 3). Minor peaks that appeared after HOCl treatment (Fig. 1C) proved difficult to characterize and were not investigated further. We also observed three prominent peaks of material after we exposed the peptide to myeloperoxidase and H2O2 (Fig. 1C), a system that generates HOCl by oxidizing chloride. The three peptides had identical retention times to those that appeared after HOCl exposure, strongly implicating HOCl in the enzymatic reaction pathway. These observations indicate that H2O2 and HOCl react with the cysteine switch peptide by different pathways, yielding distinct patterns of oxidation products. We used LC/MS with an ion-trapping instrument to determine the molecular details of cysteine switch oxidation by HOCl or H2O2. Electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry analysis of control peptide detected a major ion at m/z913.6 (Fig. 2A), the predicted molecular mass of the protonated cysteine switch peptide ([peptide + H]+). The isotopic pattern of the ion confirmed that it had one positive charge (Fig. 2A, inset). The sequence of the cysteine switch peptide was confirmed using an ion trapping instrument and MS/MS and MS/MS/MS analysis, which selects a precursor ion for low energy gas phase collisional activation and subjects the resulting product ions to MS. Under these conditions, peptide ions fragment primarily at the amide bond, yielding a ladder of sequence ions (51Yates 3rd, J.R. J. Mass Spectrom. 1998; 33: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar). Retention of charge on the N-terminal portion of the peptide ion yields a b-type ion; retention on the C-terminal portion of the peptide ion yields a y-type ion. Subtracting the masses of adjacent ions reveals the amino acid sequence. An ion-trapping instrument allows this process to be iterated (MSn). MS/MS analysis of the m/z 913.6 ion derived from the unmodified peptide revealed a series of b-type ions (b3,m/z 357.2; b5, m/z 513.3; b7, m/z 725.5; b8, m/z824.5) consistent with the sequence of the cysteine switch peptide (Fig. 2B). When the m/z 725.5 ion (b7) in the MS/MS mass spectrum was subjected to MS3 analysis, a ladder of b-type ions corresponding to the entire sequence of the peptide was apparent (Fig. 2C). We then characterized the compounds from the three peaks that appeared after we exposed the cysteine switch peptide to HOCl or to H2O2 plus myeloperoxidase (Figs. 1C,1D, and 3A). Forpeak 1, LC/MS analysis demonstrated major ions atm/z 473.3 and 945.3 (Fig. 3B), the predicted masses of the doubly charged cysteine switch peptide plus 2 oxygens ([peptide + 32 atomic mass units + 2H]2+) and the singly charged cysteine switch peptide plus 2 oxygens ([peptide + 32 atomic mass units + H]+). Ions of m/z 757.3 and 545.2 (b7 and b5) were derived from the ion ofm/z 945.3. MS/MS analysis of the m/z 545.2 ion demonstrated that the cysteine residue had gained 32 atomic mass units, strongly suggesting that its thiol group had been oxidized to sulfinic acid (RSO2H). LC/MS analysis of the peak 2 material (Figs. 1B,1C, and 3A) revealed major ions at m/z481.3 and 961.5 (Fig. 3D), the predicted masses of the doubly charged cysteine switch peptide plus 3 oxygens ([peptide + 48 atomic mass units + 2H]2+) and the singly charged cysteine switch peptide plus 3 oxygens ([peptide + 48 atomic mass units + H]+). MS/MS analysis of the m/z 561.5 ion (Fig.3E) demonstrated that the cysteine residue had gained 48 atomic mass units, strongly suggesting that its thiol group had been oxidized to sulfonic acid (RSO3H). Collectively, these observations indicate that HOCl converts the thiol residue of the cysteine switch peptide to sulfinic acid and sulfonic acid. MS analysis of the peak 3 material (Figs. 1B and4A) revealed a major ion atm/z 912.8 (Fig. 4B), the predicted mass of a doubly charged dimer (RSSR) containing a disulfide cross-link ([peptide + peptide − 2H + 2H]2+). The isotopic pattern of the ion indicated that the dimer was doubly charged (Fig. 4B, inset). We confirmed that the material in peak 3 had the same structure as the disulfide-bonded dimer of the cysteine switch peptide by LC/MS/MS. This demonstrated an ion of m/z 724.5 (Fig. 4C), which is consistent with loss of two amino acid residues from both peptides ([peptide + peptide − 2H − VA − VA + H]+). We used HPLC to quantify the progress curves and product yields for oxidation of the cysteine switch peptide by H2O2, the myeloperoxidase-H2O2 system, and HOCl. All reactions were carried out at 37 °C in neutral buffer containing plasma concentrations of chloride and calcium. A 60-min exposure to a 2-fold molar excess of H2O2 converted about half the peptide to the disulfide-linked dimer (Fig. 5A), which was the only product. Adding nanomolar concentrations of myeloperoxidase to the mixture increased the reaction rate more than 20-fold (Fig.5B). The product yield also increased; nearly all of the peptide was converted to roughly equal amounts of dimer and the sulfinic acid derivative. HOCl reacted much more rapidly with the peptide than did H2O2 (Fig. 5C). The major oxidation product generated by HOCl was the disulfide cross-linked dimer and sulfinic acid. When the mole ratio of HOCl to peptide was 1:1, conversion of cysteine switch peptide to oxidation products was nearly quantitative (Fig. 5D). As the ratio increased, so did the yield of the sulfinic acid oxidation product (Fig. 5D). Collectively, these observations indicate that HOCl reacts much more readily than H2O2 with the thiol group of the cysteine switch peptide and that continuous, slow production of HOCl by the myeloperoxidase-H2O2 system favors oxygenation of the thiol. Because both MMP-7 and myeloperoxidase are localized to subpopulations of macrophages in human atherosclerotic lesions (9Halpert I. Roby J.D. Sires U.I. Potter-Perigo S. Wight T.N. Welgus H.G.

https://openalex.org/W2071531606,"The Akt/protein kinase B (PKB) serine/threonine kinase is well known as an important mediator of many cell survival signaling pathways. Here, we demonstrate for the first time a major role of Akt/PKB in the cell invasion properties of the highly metastatic cell line HT1080. Using confocal microscopic analyses of live samples, we found Akt/PKB to be localized in the leading edge membrane area of migrating HT1080 cells. This localization was dependent on phosphoinositide 3-kinase and required the lipid binding ability of the phosphoinositide binding pleckstrin homology domain of Akt/PKB. We examined the possible function of Akt/PKB in HT1080 invasion. Surprisingly, Akt/PKB potently promoted HT1080 invasion, by increasing cell motility and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) production, in a manner highly dependent on its kinase activity and membrane-translocating ability. The increase in MMP-9 production was mediated by activation of nuclear factor-kappaB transcriptional activity by Akt/PKB. However, Akt/PKB did not affect the cell-cell or cell-matrix adhesion properties of HT1080. Our findings thus establish Akt/PKB as a major factor in the invasive abilities of cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W1972870617,"Recent evidence suggests that many signaling molecules localize in microdomains of the plasma membrane, particularly caveolae. In this study, overexpression of adenylyl cyclase was used as a functional probe of G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) compartmentation. We found that three endogenous receptors in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes couple with different levels of efficiency to the activation of adenylyl cyclase type 6 (AC6), which localizes to caveolin-rich membrane fractions. Overexpression of AC6 enhanced the maximal cAMP response to beta(1)-adrenergic receptor (beta(1)AR)-selective activation 3.7-fold, to beta(2)AR-selective activation only 1.6-fold and to prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) not at all. Therefore, the rank order of efficacy in coupling to AC6 is beta(1)AR > beta(2)AR > prostaglandin E(2) receptor (EP(2)R). beta(2)AR coupling efficiency was greater when we overexpressed the receptor or blocked its desensitization by expressing betaARKct, an inhibitor of G protein-coupled receptor kinase activation, but was not significantly greater when cells were treated with pertussis toxin. Assessment of receptor and AC expression indicated co-localization of AC5/6, beta(1)AR, and beta(2)AR, but not EP(2)R, in caveolin-rich membranes and caveolin-3 immunoprecipitates, likely explaining the observed activation of AC6 by betaAR subtypes but lack thereof by PGE(2). When cardiomyocytes were stimulated with a betaAR agonist, beta(2)AR were no longer found in caveolin-3 immunoprecipitates; an effect that was blocked by expression of betaARKct. Thus, agonist-induced translocation of beta(2)AR out of caveolae causes a sequestration of receptor from effector and likely contributes to the lower efficacy of beta(2)AR coupling to AC6 as compared with beta(1)AR, which do not similarly translocate. Therefore, spatial co-localization is a key determinant of efficiency of coupling by particular extracellular signals to activation of GPCR-linked effectors."
https://openalex.org/W1997339395,"The seven-subunit Arp2/3 complex choreographs the formation of branched actin networks at the leading edge of migrating cells. When activated by Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome protein (WASp), the Arp2/3 complex initiates actin filament branches from the sides of existing filaments. Electron cryomicroscopy and three-dimensional reconstruction of Acanthamoeba castellanii and Saccharomyces cerevisiae Arp2/3 complexes bound to the WASp carboxy-terminal domain reveal asymmetric, oblate ellipsoids. Image analysis of actin branches indicates that the complex binds the side of the mother filament, and Arp2 and Arp3 (for actin-related protein) are the first two subunits of the daughter filament. Comparison to the actin-free, WASp-activated complexes suggests that branch initiation involves large-scale structural rearrangements within Arp2/3."

Here we describe a previously unappreciated mechanism by which β-arrestin orchestrates the process of receptor endocytosis through the activation of ADP-ribosylation factor 6 (ARF6), a small GTP-binding protein. Involvement of ARF6 in the endocytic process is demonstrated by the ability of GTP-binding defective and GTP hydrolysis-deficient mutants to inhibit internalization of the β2-adrenergic receptor. The importance of regulation of ARF6 function is shown by the ability of the ARF GTPase-activating protein GIT1 to inhibit and of the ARF nucleotide exchange factor, ARNO, to enhance receptor endocytosis. Endogenous β-arrestin is found in complex with ARNO. Upon agonist stimulation of the receptor, β-arrestin also interacts with the GDP-liganded form of ARF6, thereby facilitating ARNO-promoted GTP loading and activation of the G protein. Thus, the agonist-driven formation of a complex including β-arrestin, ARNO, and ARF6 provides a molecular mechanism that explains how the agonist-stimulated receptor recruits a small G protein necessary for the endocytic process and controls its activation. β-Arrestins are multifunctional adaptor proteins known to regulate internalization of agonist-stimulated G protein-coupled receptors by linking them to endocytic proteins such as clathrin and AP-2.

DNA constructs for Flag-β-arrestin 1 and 2 were prepared in pVL1393, and recombinant baculoviruses were obtained using the BD BaculoGold transfection kit (BD PharMingen). FLAG-tagged β-arrestins were purified from SF9 cells 96 h post-infection. Briefly, SF9 cells were harvested in lysis buffer (1 m HEPES, 10% Nonidet P-40, 4 m NaCl, 50% glycerol, 0.4 m EDTA, protease inhibitors), cell debris were pelleted, and the supernatant was incubated with M2 affinity beads for 3–4 h at 4 °C. The beads were subsequently spun and washed three times with the lysis buffer. Purified proteins were eluted with 100 mm glycine (pH 3.5) into vials containing 1 m Tris (pH 8).

Recycling experiments were done similarly except that the agonist was removed after 30 min of stimulation by washing the cells three times with warm media. The cells were placed back at 37 °C, and the percent of initial receptors present at the cell surface was assessed 15, 30, and 60 min after agonist removal. Immunoprecipitations were done as described previously (5Premont R.T. Claing A. Vitale N. Freeman J.L.R. Pitcher J.A. Patton W.A. Moss J. Vaughan M. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate) (DSP; Pierce) (25 mm) in phosphate-buffered saline was added to each dish for 20 min, and the cells were lysed in 1 ml of FLAG-radioimmune precipitation assay buffer containing protease inhibitors. The samples were incubated at 4 °C for 1 h and spun at 15,000 rpm for 20 min to pellet the particulate fraction. Twenty μl was removed for direct immunoblotting of the lysates. Affinity gel FLAG beads (15 μl) (Sigma) were added to each tube, and the samples were rotated for 6 h at 4 °C. The proteins were eluted into 40 μl of SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer containing 5% β-mercaptoethanol by heating to 95 °C for 10 min. Proteins were resolved on 14% gels and detected by immunoblot analysis. pGEX2T plasmids bearing ARNO or β-arrestin 1 carboxyl-terminal (319) DNAs were prepared, and fusion proteins were purified as described previously (4Laporte S.A.

GST fusion proteins on glutathione-Sepharose 4B were incubated in 200 μl of binding buffer B (20 mm Tris, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 25 mm NaCl, 2 mmEDTA, 0.2% Triton X-100, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ATP, pH 7.4) containing protease inhibitors for 4 h at 4 °C with purified 6xHis-β-arrestin 1 or recombinant myristoylated ARF6 protein in the absence or presence of either GDPβS or GTPγS. The beads were spun and washed three times with binding buffer followed by two washes with binding buffer without any detergent. Beads were resuspended in 2× SDS sample buffer, incubated at 95 °C for 10 min, resolved by electrophoresis on a 14% gel, transferred onto nitrocellulose, and analyzed by Western blot or stained with Coomassie Blue for GST-protein detection. Co-immunoprecipitations from whole brain extract were performed as described previously (29McDonald P.H. Chow C.W. Miller W.E. Laporte S.A. Field M.E. Lin F.T. Davis R.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 2000; 290: 1574-1577Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). β-Arrestins were immunoprecipitated from the supernatant using an antibody specific for β-arrestins (A1CT) covalently cross-linked to Reactigel beads (Pierce). Immunoprecipitated proteins were detected by immunoblot analysis using a goat anti-ARNO amino-terminal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and the β-arrestin polyclonal antibody. [35S]GTPγS loading assays were done as described previously (30Someya A. Sata M. Takeda K. Pacheco-Rodriguez G. Ferrans V.J. Moss J. Vaughan M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2413-2418Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Briefly, [35S]GTPγS binding to purified recombinant ARF6 (myristoylated and nonmyristoylated forms) was assayed in a total volume of 50 μl using a rapid filtration procedure. ARF6 (0.36 μg), [35S]GTPγS (4 μm: 1 × 106 cpm) without or with GST-ARNO (1 μg) and β-arrestin 1 (5 μg) were incubated for the indicated times at 37 °C. After the reaction was stopped by the addition of 2 ml of wash buffer and rapid filtration onto nitrocellulose, the amount of protein-bound [35S]GTPγS was quantified. Data are reported as mean ± S.E. of values from duplicate assays and expressed as the amount of GTPγS specifically bound to ARF6. The mean and standard error of the mean are expressed for values obtained from the number of separate experiments indicated performed in duplicate. Statistical analysis was performed by a two-way analysis-of-variance followed by an unpaired Student's t test or Tukey's statistical test. To directly investigate the role of ARF proteins in endocytosis of GPCRs, we first expressed wild type and mutant ARF proteins together with the β2AR and examined receptor internalization following isoproterenol stimulation. Expression of wild type ARF6 did not significantly affect β2AR sequestration from the cell surface at any time point, whereas overexpression of a mutant defective in GTP hydrolysis (ARF6Q67L) or in GTP binding (ARF6T27N) showed marked inhibitory effects (Fig. 1 a). In contrast, expression of ARF1 or ARF1 mutants, ARF1T31N or ARF1Q71L, had no effect on β2AR endocytosis (data not shown). Presumably, this is because activated ARF1 is mainly found on intracellular membranes, whereas activated ARF6 is mainly localized at the plasma membrane. Interestingly, expression of ARF6 mutants prevents constitutive recycling of the transferrin receptor, another process involving cell surface vesicle trafficking (12D'Souza-Schorey C. Li G. Colombo M.I. Stahl P.D. Science. 1995; 267: 1175-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). Although expression of wild type ARF6 had no effect on the kinetics of recycling of the β2AR, expression of the ARF6Q67L mutant totally prevented reappearance of internalized receptors at the cell surface, even after 60 min of recovery when 95% of internalized receptors are normally recycled (Fig. 1 b). These data suggest that ARF proteins, namely ARF6, regulate internalization as well as recycling of the β2AR, two processes requiring plasma membrane vesicle trafficking. Like other small GTP-binding proteins, activation of ARF by GTP loading is regulated by nucleotide exchange factors, whereas inactivation by GTP hydrolysis is facilitated by GAPs. We have previously shown that expression of the ARF GTPase-activating protein GIT1 markedly inhibits internalization of the β2AR (6Claing A. Perry S.J. Achiriloaie M. Walker J.K. Albanesi J.P. Lefkowitz R.J. Premont R.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1119-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Therefore, we hypothesized that expression of an appropriate ARF guanine nucleotide exchange factor would facilitate ARF6 activation, thereby leading to increased receptor internalization. In HEK 293 cells, we transiently expressed ARNO, an exchange factor for both ARF1 and ARF6 that is localized to the plasma membrane (26Hong J.X. Haun R.S. Tsai S.C. Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9743-9745Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Frank S. Upender S. Hansen S.H. Casanova J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23-27Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar), and examined the internalization profile of the β2AR. Increased cellular levels of ARNO led to increased agonist-stimulated internalization of receptors, whereas expression of GIT1 was inhibitory (Fig. 1 c). These results suggest that expression of ARNO facilitates receptor internalization by promoting ARF6 activation. In contrast, GIT1 expression may reduce receptor internalization by triggering immediate inactivation of ARF6. Our data on the contribution of ARF regulatory proteins support the role of ARF6 in regulating agonist-promoted receptor endocytosis. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which ARF6 regulates receptor internalization, we set out to identify proteins interacting with ARF6 and its regulatory proteins. The β–arrestins have been shown to play an important role in receptor internalization through their direct interaction with clathrin and its adaptor protein, AP-2 (2Goodman Jr., O.B. Krupnick J.G. Santini F. Gurevich V.V. Penn R.B. Gagnon A.W. Keen J.H. Benovic J.L. Nature. 1996; 383: 447-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (1172) Google Scholar, 3Laporte S.A. Oakley R.H. Zhang J. Holt J.A. Ferguson S.S. Caron M.G. Barak L.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3712-3717Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that β-arrestin, a protein recruited to GRK-phosphorylated receptors, might also play a role in the regulation of ARF6 function. Therefore, we examined whether ARF6 could interact with β-arrestin 1 and β-arrestin 2. Cells expressing HA-β2AR, Flag-β-arrestin 1, or Flag-β-arrestin 2 and ARF6 were left untreated or were stimulated with isoproterenol for 2, 5, and 10 min. Subsequently, Flag-β-arrestin proteins were immunoprecipitated, and associated ARF6 was detected by immunoblotting. Interestingly, the binding of ARF6 to β-arrestin 1 or β-arrestin 2 increased following receptor stimulation and could be detected readily after 2 min of agonist stimulation (Fig. 2 a). The interaction was found to be maximal after 5 and 10 min of receptor activation. von Zastrow and Kobilka (32von Zastrow M. Kobilka B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3530-3538Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have reported that β2AR targeting to clathrin-coated pits occurs after 2 min of agonist activation. Similarly, β-arrestin 2 can be found in complex with the β subunit of AP-2 following 2 min of β2AR stimulation (3Laporte S.A. Oakley R.H. Zhang J. Holt J.A. Ferguson S.S. Caron M.G. Barak L.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3712-3717Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). Therefore, our data suggest that ARF6 activation following receptor stimulation might regulate early events of the endocytic process. Using similar experimental conditions, we were unable to co-immunoprecipitate ARF6 with the β2AR (data not shown) suggesting that β-arrestin is required to bridge this receptor to ARF-dependent signaling pathways. Mitchell et al. (33Mitchell R. McCulloch D. Lutz E. Johnson M. MacKenzie C. Fennell M. Fink G. Zhou W. Sealfon S.C. Nature. 1998; 392: 411-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) have reported that in 1321N1 cells, ARF proteins can be found in complex with several but not all Ca2+-mobilizing G protein-coupled receptors, activation of which lead to phospholipase D stimulation. Whether these interactions are direct or mediated via an adaptor protein has not yet been examined. To confirm that the interactions between β-arrestin and ARF6 were direct, we used purified recombinant Flag-β-arrestin 1 and 2 together with ARF6 and analyzed their ability to interact in vitro. As illustrated in Fig. 2 b, ARF6 can be co-immunoprecipitated with both β-arrestin 1 and β-arrestin 2. Mutagenesis studies of β-arrestin proteins have revealed that the binding sites for both clathrin and AP-2 are present in the carboxyl-terminal portion of the protein (2Goodman Jr., O.B. Krupnick J.G. Santini F. Gurevich V.V. Penn R.B. Gagnon A.W. Keen J.H. Benovic J.L. Nature. 1996; 383: 447-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (1172) Google Scholar, 3Laporte S.A. Oakley R.H. Zhang J. Holt J.A. Ferguson S.S. Caron M.G. Barak L.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3712-3717Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar, 4Laporte S.A. Oakley R.H. Holt J.A. Barak L.S. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23120-23126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). To determine whether the interaction between β-arrestin and ARF6 is also mediated via the carboxyl-terminal part of β-arrestin , we used a GST fusion protein of the last 100 amino acids of β-arrestin 1 (GST-β-arrestin 1-(319–418)) and examined the interaction with ARF6. Pull-down assays revealed that a binding site for ARF6 is present within this region of β-arrestin 1 (Fig. 2 c). Interestingly, the interaction between GST-β-arrestin 1-(318–419) and ARF6 was found to be regulated by the nature of the nucleotide bound to the small G protein, which is purified mainly in its GDP-bound state. The addition of GDPβS did not alter the interaction, whereas addition of GTPγS completely abolished the binding of ARF6 to β-arrestin 1 (Fig. 2 c). Taken together, these results suggest that β-arrestin might act as a scaffold protein bringing together the ARF protein in complex with receptors. Furthermore, this interaction is regulated by both agonist activation of the receptor and the nature of the nucleotide bound to ARF6. Once bound to GTP, activated ARF6 dissociates from β-arrestin proteins and is available to promote the endocytic process. Next, we examined whether ARNO could also interact with β-arrestin proteins. Cells overexpressing HA-β2AR, Flag-ARNO, and His-β-arrestin 1 or His-β-arrestin 2 were left untreated or stimulated with isoproterenol for 5 min. Subsequently, ARNO was immunoprecipitated, and associated β-arrestin 1 or β-arrestin 2 were detected by Western blotting. Fig. 3 a shows that ARNO can be co-immunoprecipitated with both β-arrestins. In this regard, it is interesting that a recent study reported that ARNO can promote release of a pool of membrane-associated β-arrestin involved in the desensitization process of the luteinizing hormone/choriogonadotropin receptor (34Mukherjee S. Gurevich V.V. Jones J.C. Casanova J.E. Frank S.R. Maizels E.T. Bader M.F. Kahn R.A. Palczewski K. Aktories K. Hunzicker-Dunn M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5901-5906Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In addition, ARNO and ARF6 could also be found in a complex in cells expressing HA-β2AR, Flag-ARNO, and ARF6 (data not shown). Under these experimental conditions, the interactions between ARNO and β-arrestin, as well as ARNO and ARF6, did not appear to be regulated by agonist stimulation of the receptor. Furthermore, using a GST fusion protein of ARNO and purified recombinant Flag-β-arrestin 1 and 2, ARNO and β-arrestin proteins were found to interact directly (Fig. 3 b). These results demonstrate that β-arrestin can be found in complex with ARF6 as well as with its nucleotide exchange factor, ARNO. However, the interaction between β-arrestin and ARNO does not require agonist activation of the β2AR. Furthermore, ARNO was found to interact simultaneously with β-arrestin 1 and ARF6, suggesting that the binding of β-arrestin 1 and ARF6 to ARNO is not mutually exclusive. Indeed, increasing amounts of β-arrestin 1 did not prevent ARF6 binding to ARNO (data not shown). To verify that these molecular interactions occur with endogenous proteins, β-arrestins were immunoprecipitated from bovine brain extracts with a β-arrestin-specific antibody covalently cross-linked to beads, and associated proteins were detected by immunoblotting. ARNO was found to be present in the β-arrestin immunoprecipitates but not in the pre-immune serum immunoprecipitates (Fig. 3 c). However, under several experimental conditions, we were unable to detect ARF6 in the endogenous β-arrestin immunoprecipitates (data not shown). This is likely due to the agonist dependence of this interaction, as illustrated above. These findings demonstrate a specific interaction between ARNO and β-arrestin at endogenous levels of proteins and confirm the results obtained from cellular co-immunoprecipitations and in vitro experiments. It is well established that the binding of ARNO to ARF6 serves to catalyze the exchange of GDP for GTP to activate the ARF protein. We next wanted to determine whether β-arrestin simply acts as an adaptor protein between activated receptors and the ARF6 complex or, rather, plays a more direct role in the regulation of the ARF6 activation process. To investigate the effect of β-arrestin on ARNO-mediated GTPγS-binding to ARF6, we used recombinant β-arrestin 1, ARF6, and ARNO in an in vitro GTPγS loading assay. The rate of GTPγS binding to ARF6 was enhanced by increasing concentrations of ARNO (data not shown). Further, the amount of GTPγS bound to ARF6 in the presence of ARNO was significantly increased in a time-dependent fashion, consistent with its role as an ARF nucleotide exchange factor (Fig. 4). Using an amount of ARNO that leads to submaximal GTP loading, further addition of β-arrestin 1 led to a marked potentiation of the rate of activation of ARF6 stimulated by ARNO without affecting maximal loading of GTPγS. Therefore, the effect of β-arrestin 1 was most significant at early time points (5 and 10 min). In the absence of ARNO, β-arrestin 1 did not have any effect on the amount of GTPγS bound to ARF6. These data suggest that by interacting with both ARF6 and ARNO, β-arrestin 1 facilitates GTP loading of the ARF protein, thereby leading to a potentiation of the activation of this small GTP-binding protein. Recent reports have demonstrated that ARF proteins are involved in several intracellular trafficking processes. Here, we show that ARF6 regulates internalization of the β2AR, a prototypical G protein-coupled receptor. Expression of the GTP hydrolysis-deficient mutant (ARF6Q67L) or the GTP binding-defective mutant (ARF6T27N) results in the inhibition of the internalization process. Interestingly, expression of ARF6Q67L or ARF6T27N inhibits Fcγ receptor-mediated phagocytosis in macrophages while stimulating endocytosis at the apical surface of Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (15Zhang Q.

Brodsky F. Apodaca G. Mostov K. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 7-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Several reports have demonstrated that ARF6Q67L accumulates at the plasma membrane where it induces invaginations, whereas ARF6T27N is distributed to an internal tubulovesicular compartment (17Radhakrishna H. Donaldson J.G. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 49-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar, 18D'Souza-Schorey C. van Donselaar E. Hsu V.W. Yang C. Stahl P.D. Peters P.J. J.

Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 1003-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Although both ARF6 mutants affect internalization, they probably do so by different mechanisms (15Zhang Q. Cox D. Tseng C.C. Donaldson J.G. Greenberg S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19977-19981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 16Altschuler Y. Liu S. Katz L. Tang K. Hardy S. Brodsky F. Apodaca G. Mostov K. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 7-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Similarly, we have shown that expression of GIT1, an ARF GAP, also inhibits internalization of the β2AR. However, expression of ARNO, an ARF guanine nucleotide exchange factor, is stimulatory. By overexpressing GIT1, we might promote rapid and unregulated inactivation of ARF6, thereby leading to inhibition of vesicle formation. In contrast, expression of ARNO would result in further ARF6 activation and therefore promote vesicle formation. At endogenous levels of proteins, both ARNO and GIT probably contribute to the formation of endocytic vesicles by regulating, in a coordinated fashion, the turnover of nucleotide on ARF proteins. According to our findings, β-arrestin appears to serve as an agonist-controlled scaffold bringing together the exchange factor, ARNO, and the GDP-bound form of ARF6, thereby promoting ARF6 activation in proximity to the receptor. The agonist dependence of the ARF6 interaction with β-arrestin brings this entire process under the control of the receptor. Once bound to GTP, active ARF6 proteins dissociate from β-arrestin and are now available to promote the endocytic process. The biochemical details involved in this process remain to be determined. However, the closely related ARF1 protein is known to drive vesicle budding from donor membranes by promoting coat protein assembly through the recruitment of AP-1 and coatomers (COPI, COPII, and clathrin) (36Liang J.O.

Cell. 2000; 101: 693-696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Furthermore, ARF6 has been shown to activate phospholipase D, thereby increasing the levels of phosphatidic acid, and to activate phosphatidylinositol 4- and 5-kinase activity to increase phosphatidylinositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate levels (8Chavrier P. Goud B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 466-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar,38Cukierman E. Huber I. Rotman M. Cassel D. Science. 1995; 270: 1999-2002Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Interestingly, β-arrestin, GRK, ARNO, and GIT proteins all bind to phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate and/or phosphatidylinositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (39Vitale N. Patton W.A. Moss J. Vaughan M.

Therefore, activation of ARF6 following GPCR stimulation would presumably lead to the recruitment of vesicle coat proteins (clathrin and AP-2), reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton, and modification of the lipid content of the plasma membrane, all of which promote receptor endocytosis. Subsequently, inactivation of ARF6 by GTP hydrolysis, which is necessary for proper trafficking, is achieved by ARF GAPs such as GIT1, which as previously illustrated are recruited to the receptor through their interaction with GRKs (5Premont R.T. Claing A. Vitale N. Freeman J.L.R. Pitcher J.A. Patton W.A. Moss J. Vaughan M. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14082-14087Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). The results reported here add to the growing list of β-arrestin-regulated functions that link these molecules to endocytosis.

https://openalex.org/W1908444498,"The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha is a ligand-activated transcription factor that plays an important role in the regulation of lipid homeostasis. PPARalpha mediates the effects of fibrates, which are potent hypolipidemic drugs, on gene expression. To better understand the biological effects of fibrates and PPARalpha, we searched for genes regulated by PPARalpha using oligonucleotide microarray and subtractive hybridization. By comparing liver RNA from wild-type and PPARalpha null mice, it was found that PPARalpha decreases the mRNA expression of enzymes involved in the metabolism of amino acids. Further analysis by Northern blot revealed that PPARalpha influences the expression of several genes involved in trans- and deamination of amino acids, and urea synthesis. Direct activation of PPARalpha using the synthetic PPARalpha ligand WY14643 decreased mRNA levels of these genes, suggesting that PPARalpha is directly implicated in the regulation of their expression. Consistent with these data, plasma urea concentrations are modulated by PPARalpha in vivo. It is concluded that in addition to oxidation of fatty acids, PPARalpha also regulates metabolism of amino acids in liver, indicating that PPARalpha is a key controller of intermediary metabolism during fasting."
https://openalex.org/W2093680171,"Dehydroepiandrosterone sulfotransferase (STD) is a hydroxysteroid sulfo-conjugating enzyme with preferential substrate specificity for C-19 androgenic steroids and C-24 bile acids. STD is primarily expressed in the liver, intestine and adrenal cortex. Earlier studies have shown that androgens inhibit the rat Std promoter function through a negative androgen response region located between −235 and −310 base pair positions (Song, C. S., Jung, M. H., Kim, S. C., Hassan, T., Roy, A. K., and Chatterjee, B. (1998) J. Biol. Chem.273, 21856–21866). Here we report that the primary bile acid chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) also acts as an important regulator of the Std gene promoter. CDCA is a potent inducer of the Std gene, and its inducing effect is mediated through the bile acid-activated farnesoid X receptor (FXR), a recently characterized member of the nuclear receptor superfamily. The ligand-activated FXR acts as a heterodimer with the 9-cis-retinoic acid receptor (RXR) and regulates the Std gene by binding to an upstream region at base pair positions −169 to −193. This specific binding region was initially identified by bile acid responsiveness of the progressively deleted forms of the Std promoter in transfected HepG2 hepatoma and enterocyte-like Caco-2 cells. Subsequently, the precise RXR/FXR binding position was established by protein-DNA interaction using in vitro footprinting and electrophoretic mobility shift analyses. Unlike all other previously characterized FXR target genes, which contain an inverted repeat (IR) of the consensus hexanucleotide half-site (A/G)G(G/T)TCA with a single nucleotide spacer (IR-1), the bile acid response element of the Std promoter does not contain any spacer between the two hexanucleotide repeats (IR-0). A promoter-reporter construct carrying three tandem copies of the IR-0 containing −169/−193 element, linked to a minimal thymidine kinase promoter, can be stimulated more than 70-fold in transfected Caco-2 cells upon CDCA treatment.

These cholesterol derivatives also function as the autoregulated sensor to modulate the expression of the enzymes and proteins that are involved in bile acid and cholesterol metabolism through enterohepatic re-absorption and fecal excretion.

In this case, the activated FXR induces SHP expression that in turn inhibits CYP7A1 gene transcription through functional interference with the fetoprotein transcription factor (FTF), which acts as a competence factor in the basal and oxysterol-induced expression of the CYP7A1 gene. Unlike the ubiquitous RXR, FXR has a restricted tissue distribution (5Lu T.T. Repa J.J. Mangelsdorf D.J. J. Biol.

FXR is expressed in the liver, intestine, and kidney, the same tissues that play critical roles in bile acid metabolism and thus need to respond to changes in the bile acid flux. Additionally, FXR is expressed in the adrenal cortex (5Lu T.T. Repa J.J. Mangelsdorf D.J. J. Biol.

Interestingly, the same tissues also express FXR. Because of its bile acid sulfo-conjugating activity, STD is expected to be an important component of the cholesterol removal mechanism through fecal loss.In this article, we show that the primary bile acid chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA), a known ligand for FXR, is a potent inducer of the rat Std promoter and this induction is mediated through a response element located between −169 and −193 positions. Unlike the IR-1 arrangement of the RXR/FXR binding sites identified in the IBABP, BSEP, PLTP, and SHPgenes, the −169/−193 site in the Std promoter contains an IR-0 motif as the FXR cognate element. Thus, the rat Std promoter provides the first example of an IR-0-containing FXR target gene. We speculate that increased solubility of sulfated bile acids facilitates their intracellular transport and clearance, thereby contributing to overall cholesterol homeostasis.DISCUSSIONSulfo-conjugation of hydroxyl and amino groups by sulfotransferases is a commonly utilized metabolic pathway for detoxification of hormones, neurotransmitters, drugs, and xenobiotics (17Weinshilboum R.M.

Commun. 1999; 254: 65-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Sulfotransferases in mammalian cells constitute a large family of at least 44 similar enzymes, each containing two active sites: one for the sulfate donor PAPS and the other for the acceptor substrates (17Weinshilboum R.M. Otterness D.M. Aksoy I.A. Wood T C Her C. Raftogianis R.B. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 3-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar, 38Rikke B.A. Roy A.K. Biochim. Biophys.

Genomics. 2000; 65: 157-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Individual members of this enzyme family display distinct, albeit somewhat broad, substrate specificity. STD, which was originally thought to be involved in the metabolism of C-19 hydroxysteroids and in the inactivation of androgenic hormones (40Chan J. Song C.S. Matusik R.J. Chatterjee B. Roy A.K. Chem. Biol. Interact. 1998; 109: 267-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), is now realized to be a multifunctional enzyme with substrate affinity for both bile acids and androgens. In the rodent liver, the high expression of Std during the androgen-insensitive state of the hepatic tissue in senescent males is thought to be a result of the efficient conversion of androgens to androgen sulfates, which are receptor-inactive (19Chatterjee B. Song C.S. Kim J.M. Roy A.K. Chem. Biol. Interact. 1994; 92: 273-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar,40Chan J. Song C.S. Matusik R.J. Chatterjee B. Roy A.K. Chem. Biol. Interact. 1998; 109: 267-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Although the exact role of bile acid sulfation is presently unknown, it is reasonable to speculate that sulfo-conjugation of bile acids will reduce their detergent properties, and at the same time enhance their aqueous solubility, thereby facilitating intracellular transport of these cholesterol catabolites. Sulfation may also aid in the fecal clearance of bile acids/salts and, consequently, cholesterol elimination from the body.In the present study, we have shown that the recombinantly produced STD catalyzes sulfate conjugation of the dihydroxylated primary bile acid CDCA and the monohydroxy secondary bile acid LCA. Most importantly, we show that the promoter for the rat DHEA-sulfotransferase is induced by the primary bile acid CDCA in transfected liver and intestinal cell lines. Additionally, we observed that endogenous STD gene expression was stimulated ∼2-fold in HepG2 and Caco-2 cells after CDCA treatment (data not shown). These results favor the speculation that sulfation may be a protective mechanism to help reduce the toxicity of high levels of bile acids and facilitate their intracellular transport and urinary and fecal clearance. The CDCA-dependent induction of the Std gene promoter is reminiscent of the self-regulatory mechanisms that are operational for a number of genes concerned with the synthesis, transport, and elimination of bile acids, thereby ensuring that the bile acid flux remains within an optimum range.

Thus, in a unique regulatory scheme, two principal substrates of this sulfotransferase,i.e. androgens and bile acids, are also the activating ligands for two members of the nuclear receptor superfamily (i.e. androgen receptor and FXR) that control the expression of this enzyme. Although such auto-regulatory loops have been extensively characterized for homeostatic schemes in prokaryotes (e.g. the classical lac operon), similar pathways to self-regulation in the mammalian system have not been clearly deciphered.FXR functions as an obligate heterodimer with the 9-cis-retinoic acid receptor (RXR) and regulates target gene expression by binding to an inverted repeat of a hexanucleotide sequence motif. The optimal DNA binding element for the RXR/FXR heterodimer is an IR-1 sequence of the (A/G)G(G/T)TCA half-site, as ascertained from the analysis of the oligonucleotides that can be selectively amplified from a pool of random sequences after multiple rounds of binding to a mixture of recombinant RXR-α and FXR (15Laffitte B.A. Kast H.R. Nguyen C.M. Zavacki A.M. Moore D.D. Edwards P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10638-10647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Initial reports on four natural target genes for FXR (IBABP,PLTP, SHP, and BSEP) revealed that all of them contain the functional FXR site with a single nucleotide spacer between the inverted hexanucleotide repeat (IR-1). However, our finding with the Std gene promoter extends this view to include an IR-0 palindrome (GGGTCATGAACT) as an alternative binding modality for the RXR/FXR heterodimer. Two lines of evidence further established the role of this IR-0 motif in the bile acid response. 1) the −169/−193 element can confer CDCA-dependent induction of a heterologous promoter (thymidine kinase) in HepG2 and Caco-2 cells; 2) disruption of the IR-0 sequence by point mutations (GGGTCATGAACT → GGGTACCGAACT) completely abrogated the CDCA-induced activity of the TK promoter.Because only part of the EMSA complex at the −169/−193 element is recognized by the anti-FXR or anti-RXR-α antibody, it is likely that other transcription factors are also present in this complex. In preliminary antibody supershift analysis, we have found evidence for the presence of the orphan nuclear receptor HNF-4 in this EMSA complex. 2C. S. Song, I. Echchgadda, and B. Chatterjee, unpublished data. Furthermore, the antisense sequence 5′-CCAAGTTCA within the −169/−193 site is similar to the consensus element YCAAGGYCR for FTF (4Castillo-Olivares A. Gil G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17793-17799Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). FTF serves as a competence factor in the oxysterol-induced CYP7A1 gene expression mediated by the liver X receptor and its heterodimeric partner RXR-α; FTF is also required for the expression of CYP8b, the enzyme that directs production of cholic acid in the bile acid biosynthetic pathway. It is interesting to note that both HNF-4 and FTF are expressed in the liver and intestine (16Repa J.J. Mangelsdorf D.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 459-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar), the same two tissues that also express STD and FXR.In conclusion, our results show that STD, a bile acid sulfotransferase, is induced by the primary bile acid CDCA in liver and intestinal cell lines via an IR-0 element cognate to the FXR/RXR-α heterodimer. The physiological role of this regulatory pathway remains to be clearly delineated. The Cyp27 null mice that are deficient in sterol 27-hydroxylase, the rate-limiting enzyme in the acidic pathway to CDCA synthesis, are reported to be severely deficient in bile acid pools (44Repa J.J. Lund E.G. Horton J.D. Leitersdorf E. Russell D.W. Dietschy J.M. Turley S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39685-39692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). These animals display hypercholesterolemia and hyperlipidemia similar to the human CYP27 deficiency syndrome. It will be of interest to determine the impact of Cyp27 deficiency on Std gene expression. Because the enterohepatic metabolic loop plays a critical role in bile acid/cholesterol homeostasis, further characterization of the role of FXR signaling in Std gene expression may be of considerable physiological significance. Bile acids modulate gene expression by serving as ligands for the farnesoid X receptor (FXR),1which is a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily. They are produced in the liver as C-24 hydroxysteroid metabolites of cholesterol and serve as intestinal emulsifying agents for hydrophobic nutrients (1Bahar R.J. Stolz A. Gastroenterol. Clin. North Am. 1999; 28: 27-58Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 2Russell D.W.

Cell. 2000; 103: 1-4Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). These cholesterol derivatives also function as the autoregulated sensor to modulate the expression of the enzymes and proteins that are involved in bile acid and cholesterol metabolism through enterohepatic re-absorption and fecal excretion. For example, bile acids repress expression of the gene for CYP7A1, the rate-limiting enzyme for the neutral pathway to bile acid biosynthesis, and for CYP8B, a 12α-hydroxylase enzyme that routes the neutral pathway to cholic acid synthesis (2Russell D.W. Cell. 1999; 97: 539-542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 3Chawla A. Saez E. Evans R.M.

Bile acids also direct their own uptake by negatively regulating the hepatic expression of the sodium/taurocholate cotransporter polypeptide, a basolateral protein that imports bile acids into hepatocytes from the sinusoidal blood (6Denson L.A.

On the other hand, bile acids induce the genes for the ileal bile acid-binding protein (IBABP), the bile salt efflux pump (BSEP), the phospholipid transfer protein (PLTP), and the inhibitory orphan receptor protein, known as the small heterodimer partner (SHP) (7Grober J.

Among the likely causes of lesional macrophage death is intracellular accumulation of excess free cholesterol (FC), which is known to occur in vivo. We recently showed that FC loading of macrophages causes apoptosis, ∼50% of which is mediated by activation of cell-surface FasL and triggering of the Fas pathway (Yao, P. M., and Tabas, I. (2000)J. Biol. Chem. 275, 23807–23813). To elucidate other pathways of death in FC-loaded macrophages, we investigated mitochondrial transmembrane potential (ΔΨm) and the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway in FC-loaded mouse peritoneal macrophages. Starting between 3 and 6 h of FC loading, ΔΨm was markedly decreased in the majority of macrophages and was independent of the Fas pathway. The decrease in ΔΨmby FC loading was not prevented by GSH, thus distinguishing it from 7-ketocholesterol-induced mitochondrial dysfunction. Cytochrome c release into the cytosol was noted by 4 h of FC loading, and activation of caspase-9 and effector caspases was observed at 6 h. Finally, we found that both cellular and mitochondrial levels of the pro-apoptotic protein Bax were increased severalfold as early as 4 h after FC loading. Thus, FC loading, perhaps via increased levels of Bax and/or cholesterol overloading of mitochondria, triggers cytochrome c release and activation of caspase-9 and the effector caspases, leading to macrophage apoptosis. These findings and our previous data support a model in which FC loading of macrophages promotes a dual program of caspase-mediated death.

For example, death of macrophages may contribute to the release of plaque-destabilizing and thrombogenic molecules in more advanced lesions. In support of this idea, “necrotic” cores of advanced atheromata, which contain the debris of dead macrophages (2Ball R.Y. Stowers E.C. Burton J.H. Cary N.R. Skepper J.N. Mitchinson M.J.

Med. 1992; 326: 242-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (2909) Google Scholar). Moreover, fragments of plasma membrane shed by apoptotic lesional cells are rich in thrombogenic tissue factor activity (6Mallat Z. Hugel B. Ohan J. Leseche G. Freyssinet J.M. Tedgui A. Circulation. 1999; 99: 348-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). More directly, apoptotic macrophages, but not apoptotic smooth muscle cells or T cells, are greatly increased in ruptured plaques versusstable plaques (7Kolodgie F.D. Narula J. Burke A.P. Haider N.

To elucidate the roles of macrophage death in atherosclerosis, it is necessary to gain a thorough understanding of the inducers and cellular death pathways involved. Although many molecules and processes have been proposed to cause macrophage death in lesions, intracellular accumulation of excess unesterified or free cholesterol (FC)1 has been the focus of several investigators. Macrophages in advanced lesions are known to accumulate excess FC (8Lundberg B. Atherosclerosis. 1985; 56: 93-110Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 9Small D.M. Bond M.G.

Invest. 1979; 41: 160-167PubMed Google Scholar), and excess FC is a potent inducer of macrophage death (12Warner G.J. Stoudt G. Bamberger M. Johnson W.J. Rothblat G.H. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 22773-22781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). In this regard, recent work from our laboratory has demonstrated that FC loading of macrophages leads to caspase-dependent externalization of phosphatidylserine and to DNA fragmentation, consistent with an apoptotic process (14Yao P.M. Tabas I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23807-23813Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Most interestingly, approximately half of the apoptosis could be blocked by mutations in or inhibitors of the Fas pathway of cell death, implying a partial role for the Fas pathway in FC-induced apoptosis; the mechanism involves FC-induced activation of cell-surface FasL (Fasligand) (14Yao P.M. Tabas I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23807-23813Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). In this study, our goal was to determine the pathway(s) leading to caspase-dependent death in the substantial portion of FC-loaded macrophages that die independently of the Fas pathway. The data reported herein show that there is widespread, Fas-independent mitochondrial dysfunction in FC-loaded macrophages, as well as cytochrome c release, activation of caspase-9, and Fas-independent activation of effector caspases. Interestingly, levels of cellular and mitochondrial Bax, which is known to induce cytochrome c release and mitochondrion-dependent caspase activation (15Kroemer G. Reed J.C. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 513-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (2770) Google Scholar), are increased in FC-loaded macrophages. These findings and our previous data support a model in which FC loading of macrophages promotes a dual program of caspase-mediated death.

All other chemicals and reagents, including 7-ketocholesterol, phosphatidylserine, and GSH, were from Sigma, and all organic solvents were from Fisher. Macrophages were harvested from the peritonea of C57BL6/J or lpr mice (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.) 3 days after the intraperitoneal injection of 40 μg of concanavalin A in 0.5 ml of PBS and then cultured as described previously (17Tang W. Walsh A. Tabas I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1437: 301-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). On the day of the experiment, the cells were washed three times with warm PBS and incubated for the indicated times in DMEM and 1% (w/v) FBS alone or containing 100 μg/ml acetyl-LDL plus 10 μg/ml compound 58035 (FC-loading conditions) as previously described (18Shiratori Y. Okwu A.K. Tabas I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11337-11348Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). At the end of the incubation period, the cells were assayed for the end points described below. Cholesterol/PS liposomes were made by mixing 2.8 mg of PS and 1.5 mg of cholesterol (1:1 molar ratio) in chloroform. The solvent was completely removed by evaporation under nitrogen, followed by lyophilization. Three ml of PBS was added to the dried lipids. To prevent lipid oxidation during liposome preparation, butylated hydroxytoluene (10 μm final concentration) and diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (100 μm final concentration) were added. The suspension was sonicated under argon for 20 3-min bursts at 4 °C using a tapered microtip on a Branson 450 sonicator (setting 5). For the experiment displayed in Fig. 4, a 800 μg/ml stock solution of 7-ketocholesterol was prepared as described by Lizard et al. (19Lizard G. Miguet C. Bessede G. Monier S. Gueldry S. Neel D. Gambert P. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 28: 743-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Briefly, 800 μg of 7-ketocholesterol was dissolved in 50 μl of absolute ethanol, and 950 μl of DMEM containing 1% FBS was added. Fifty μl of this solution was then added to 1 ml of culture medium to obtain a final concentration of 40 μg/ml. A 100 mm stock solution of GSH was prepared in DMEM and 1% FBS and then diluted 1:5 in medium to obtain a final concentration of 20 mm. Macrophages were incubated under control or FC-loading conditions for various times and then stained with 5 μm rhodamine 123, 100 nm MitoTracker Red CMXRos, or 1 μg/ml JC-1 (1.9 μm) in PBS at 37 °C for 15–30 min. The fluorescent images were collected with a laser scanning confocal microscope (Model LSM 410 with a 100× numerical aperture and 1.4 Plan Apo objective; Carl Zeiss, Inc., Thornwood, NY). Confocal optical sections were estimated to be 1 μm in thickness. Cells were excited with the 488- and 568-nm lines of an argon laser, and emitted fluorescence was detected through 530- and 590-nm filters with a photomultiplier tube. To quantify the staining of rhodamine 123, we used the NIH Image Version 1.62f program. Intensity values represent the mean integrated fluorescence intensity per cell in a 1-μm optical section with the same background value subtracted from each image. Control or FC-loaded macrophages were lysed in cold radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (PBS containing 100 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1% Igepal CA-630, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS). For Western blotting, the samples (6–20 μg of protein) were subjected to electrophoresis using 10–14% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and the protein bands were electrotransferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. The blots were blocked in PBS and 0.05% Tween 20 containing 5% nonfat milk and incubated with the appropriate antibody as follows: rabbit anti-mouse Bax N20 IgG (0.5 μg/ml), monoclonal anti-mouse cytochrome c IgG (0.2 μg/ml), monoclonal anti-bovine cytochrome oxidase subunit IV IgG (0.2 μg/ml), and monoclonal anti-human caspase-9 IgG (1.0 μg/ml). The anti-Bax antibody incubation was carried out 1 h at room temperature, and the rest were overnight (16–24 h) at 4 °C. The secondary antibody, which was either a horseradish peroxidase-coupled goat anti-rabbit (1:1000 dilution) or anti-mouse (1:3000) IgG, was incubated for 1 h at room temperature. The secondary antibodies were visualized using the Super Signal enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (ECL) from Pierce. Control or FC-loaded macrophages were incubated with MitoTracker Red (100 nm) for 30 min at 37 °C to identify mitochondria. Next, the cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde for 10 min; permeabilized with 0.04% saponin; and incubated for 30 min at room temperature with blocking solution, which was PBS containing 2% normal goat serum, 1% bovine serum albumin, and Fc receptor blockers (25 μg/ml anti-mouse CD16/CD32 antibody and 50 μg/ml mouse IgG2a). The cells were then incubated with rabbit anti-mouse Bax P19 IgG (4 μg/ml) for 1 h in blocking solution. The secondary antibody (1:500 Alexa 488-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG) was applied for 1 h at room temperature in blocking solution. The cells were then visualized by confocal microscopy as described above. Control and FC-loaded macrophages were harvested by centrifugation at 600 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The cell pellets were washed once with ice-cold PBS and resuspended with 5 volumes of isolation buffer (250 mm sucrose containing 20 mmHEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm sodium EDTA, 1 mmsodium EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). After chilling on ice for 20 min, the cells were homogenized with ∼30–40 strokes of a Teflon homogenizer (70–80% cell breakage), and the homogenates were centrifuged at 750 × g for 10 min at 4 °C to remove unbroken cells and nuclei. The 750 × g supernatants were harvested and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, and the resulting 12,000 × g supernatants (cytosolic fraction) were concentrated severalfold using Centricon YM-3 concentrators (Mr 3000 cutoff); the mitochondria-enriched pellets were resuspended in isolation buffer. The cytosolic and mitochondrial fractions were subjected to electrophoresis and immunoblot analysis as described above. For alkali extraction, the cell monolayers were homogenized in 0.1 mNa2CO3, pH 11.5, instead of isolation buffer and subjected to the centrifugations described above. The 12,000 × g pellet was resuspended in the same alkaline buffer and centrifuged at 98,000 × g for 45 min. Finally, the resulting pellet (alkali-treated mitochondrial fraction) was resuspended in isolation buffer, electrophoresed, and assayed for Bax by immunoblotting. Activity of caspases was determined in extracts of control or FC-loaded macrophages using the fluorochromic caspase substrates DEVD-AFC and LEHD-AFC. In certain experiments, 40 μm Z-LEHD-fmk was added during the 6-h control or FC-loading incubations. At the end of the incubation period, the macrophages were harvested and rinsed in cold PBS and then collected in buffer consisting of 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 5 mmEDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μg/ml each pepstatin and leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.5% Triton X-100. The cellular material was chilled for 20 min on ice and then centrifuged for 30 min at 14,000 rpm to harvest the supernatant fraction (cell extract). After quantification of protein content using the DC protein assay, 10–40-μg aliquots of the cell extracts were incubated at 37 °C in buffer consisting of 100 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 15 μm LEHD-AFC or 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10% sucrose, 0.1% CHAPS, 10 mm dithiothreitol, and 15 μm DEVD-AFC. Cleavage of the substrates resulted in the emission of a fluorescent signal that was quantified in an SLM-AMINCO 8000 fluorometer (excitation, 400 nm; and emission, 505 nm). The incubations times were 30–120 min, and all values were obtained within the linear range of the assay. Macrophages were incubated under control or FC-loading conditions for 8.5 h, stained with Alexa 488-labeled annexin V, and viewed by fluorescence microscopy as previously described (14Yao P.M. Tabas I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23807-23813Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). For quantification, three to five fields of cells were counted for the number of annexin-positive cells and total cells. Results are given as means ± S.E. (n = 3 unless noted otherwise). As an initial assessment of mitochondrial function in FC-loaded macrophages, peritoneal macrophages from C57BL6 mice were incubated for 3, 6, or 9 h in medium alone or containing acetyl-LDL plus the acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase inhibitor compound 58035 to effect FC loading (13Tabas I.

Warner G.J. Stoltenborg J.K. Kearney M.A. Corjay M.H. Phillips M.C. Rothblat G.H. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1998; 18: 423-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The cells were then stained with rhodamine 123, which is a cationic fluorescent dye that is sequestered in mitochondria only if there is an intact transmembrane potential (ΔΨm) across the inner mitochondrial membrane (21Johnson L.V. Walsh M.L. Chen L.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 990-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (1287) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1(A–C), macrophages incubated under control conditions demonstrated widespread cytoplasmic staining consistent with a mitochondrial pattern of multiple punctate structures (see below). The overall intensity and pattern of the staining were similar at all three time points. Macrophages loaded with FC for 3 h demonstrated a staining similar to that seen with unloaded cells (panel D). In marked contrast, however, the staining of macrophages loaded with FC for 6 or 9 h was substantially decreased (panels E–F). The staining pattern of macrophages incubated with compound 58035 alone was indistinguishable from that of the control macrophages (panels A–C). Quantification of the data in panels A–F using fluorescence intensity measurements of individual cells (average of 100 cells/group) is shown in panel G. More detailed images of mitochondrial staining with rhodamine 123 are shown in Fig. 2 (A and B). The punctate staining pattern of unloaded macrophages is clearly seen in panel A. In macrophages loaded with FC for 6 h (panel B), there were less numerous punctate structures per cell, and the cytoplasm was diffusely stained with the dye (arrow). This cytoplasmic staining indicates that the FC-loaded cells do not have a defect in the cellular uptake of rhodamine 123 due to a defect in the plasma membrane potential; rather, it is the ability of mitochondria to sequester the dye that is compromised under FC-loading conditions. To confirm these results, macrophages incubated under control or FC-loading conditions for 6 h were stained with MitoTracker Red CMXRos, another fluorescent dye that accumulates in mitochondria only if ΔΨm is intact (22Poot M. Zhang Y.Z. Kramer J.A. Wells K.S. Jones L.J. Hanzel D.K. Lugade A.G. Singer V.L. Haugland R.P. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1996; 44: 1363-1372Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). As shown in panel C, control macrophages demonstrated bright punctate fluorescence throughout the cytoplasm. In contrast, macrophages loaded with FC for 6 h (panel D) showed markedly less fluorescence. Finally, we investigated mitochondrial membrane potential with JC-1, a dye that has been reported to be a particularly reliable probe of ΔΨm (23Salvioli S. Ardizzoni A. Franceschi C. Cossarizza A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 411: 77-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (895) Google Scholar). With normal ΔΨm, JC-1 concentrates in mitochondria, leading to aggregate formation and a high red/green fluorescence ratio. With decreasing ΔΨm, there is less aggregate formation and thus a decrease in the red/green fluorescence ratio. As shown in panels E–H, FC loading was associated with a marked decrease in red fluorescence (panel F versus panel E) and an increase in green fluorescence (panel H versus panel G), indicative of a decrease in ΔΨm. In summary, the data in Figs. 1 and 2 indicate that by 6 h of FC loading, macrophages show markedly defective ΔΨm, indicating widespread mitochondrial dysfunction. It is possible that macrophages incubated with acetyl-LDL plus an acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase inhibitor could be exposed to toxic oxysterols or other toxic components in acetyl-LDL or that the cholesterol derived from acetyl-LDL could be converted intracellularly to toxic oxysterols (24Colles S.M. Irwin K.C. Chisolm G.M. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 2018-2028Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Lizard G. Monier S. Cordelet C. Gesquiere L. Deckert V. Gueldry S. Lagrost L. Gambert P. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1999; 19: 1190-1200Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). To address these issues, we conducted two experiments. First, we determined whether mitochondrial dysfunction could be caused by incubating macrophages with cholesterol, but not the other components of acetyl-LDL. To accomplish this goal, we made cholesterol/PS liposomes in the presence of antioxidants; PS-containing liposomes enter macrophages by the type A scavenger receptor (26Nishikawa K. Arai H. Inoue K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5226-5231Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Macrophages were stained with rhodamine 123 following incubation for 6 h with medium alone (control), with cholesterol/PS liposomes plus compound 58035, or with PS liposomes without cholesterol plus compound 58035. As shown in Fig. 3 (A–C), mitochondrial staining in macrophages incubated with cholesterol/PS liposomes was markedly less than that observed in control macrophages or macrophages incubated with PS liposomes without cholesterol; quantitative data are shown in panel D. Thus, a non-lipoprotein cholesterol-carrying particle can induce mitochondrial dysfunction in macrophages; if acetyl-LDL contains other cytotoxic components, they are not necessary for mitochondrial dysfunction. Regarding the end point of apoptosis itself, we could not use the annexin assay due to the presence of PS in the liposomes. However, cell detachment correlates with apoptosis in FC-loaded macrophages, and percent cell loss was the same in macrophages treated with acetyl-LDL plus compound 58038 (42.3 ± 2.2%) versus cholesterol/PS liposomes plus compound 58035 (41.9 ± 0.6%). Next, to address the issue that cytotoxicity might be induced by toxic oxysterols, we took advantage of the observation by Lizard et al. (19Lizard G. Miguet C. Bessede G. Monier S. Gueldry S. Neel D. Gambert P. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 28: 743-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) that 7-ketocholesterol-induced death in human monocytes is partially prevented by co-incubation with the antioxidant GSH. First, we determined whether 7-ketocholesterol could cause mitochondrial dysfunction in mouse peritoneal macrophages and, if so, whether it could be prevented by GSH. As shown in Fig. 4 C, macrophages exposed to 7-ketocholesterol plus compound 58035 displayed two distinct rhodamine 123 staining patterns: overall paucity of staining (arrow) and intense diffuse staining not reflective of a normal mitochondrial pattern (arrowhead). Note that the latter pattern, which was predominant in these cells, was never observed with acetyl-LDL plus compound 58035 (see above and panel H). Importantly, the mitochondrial staining pattern was mostly normal when GSH was included during the incubation (panel D; quantification in panel E). In contrast, the decreased mitochondrial staining of macrophages incubated with acetyl-LDL plus compound 58035 was not prevented at all by co-incubation with GSH (compare panel Iwith panel H; quantification in panel J). Thus, mitochondrial dysfunction caused by acetyl-LDL plus compound 58035 can be distinguished from that caused by a toxic oxysterol both by the pattern of mitochondrial staining and by the lack of prevention by co-incubation with GSH. We also examined the effect of GSH on apoptosis itself because GSH blocks 7-ketocholesterol-induced apoptosis as well as mitochondrial dysfunction (27Lizard G. Gueldry S. Sordet O. Monier S. Athias A. Miguet C. Bessede G. Lemaire S. Solary E. Gambert P. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 1651-1663Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). In an 8.5-h incubation, the percent apoptotic cells in macrophages incubated with acetyl-LDL plus compound 58035 in the presence of 20 mm GSH was 28.1 ± 0.8, compared with 18.9 ± 1.2 in the absence of GSH and 1.0 ± 0.3 in macrophages that were not FC-loaded at all. Thus, consistent with the rhodamine 123 data, GSH treatment did not block macrophage apoptosis induced by acetyl-LDL plus an acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase inhibitor. We have previously shown that a portion of macrophages loaded with FC for 9 h show signs of apoptosis, including externalization of phosphatidylserine and DNA fragmentation (14Yao P.M. Tabas I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23807-23813Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). These events are decreased by ∼40–60% in macrophages with defective Fas (lpr (lymphoproliferative mutation)) or FasL (gld (generalized lymphoproliferative mutation)) or in wild-type macrophages in the presence of an anti-FasL antibody (14Yao P.M. Tabas I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23807-23813Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Thus, the Fas pathway of apoptosis is activated in a portion of FC-loaded macrophages. Given that activation of the Fas pathway can directly lead to mitochondrial dysfunction in certain types of cells (28Scaffidi C. Fulda S. Srinivasan A. Friesen C. Li F. Tomaselli K.J. Debatin K.M. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1675-1687Crossref PubMed Scopus (2624) Google Scholar), we determined whether FC-induced mitochondrial dysfunction was dependent upon an intact Fas pathway. Macrophages from wild-type mice or from mice with the lpr Fas mutation (29Nagata S. Suda T. Immunol. Today. 1995; 16: 39-43Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar) were incubated under control or FC-loading conditions for 6 h and then stained with MitoTracker Red CMXRos (see above). As shown in Fig. 5, the decrease in mitochondrial staining in FC-loaded versus unloaded lpr macrophages (panel D versus panel C) was similar to that observed in wild-type macrophages (panel B versus panel A). Similar results were obtained using rhodamine 123 staining (data not shown). Thus, in FC-loaded macrophages, mitochondrial dysfunction does not depend upon Fas activation. Mitochondrial dysfunction can be associated with release of cytochrome c and activation of the proximal caspase (caspase-9), followed by effector caspase activation (e.g. caspase-3, -6, and -7) (15Kroemer G. Reed J.C. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 513-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (2770) Google Scholar). To examine this pathway, we first subjected mitochondrially enriched fractions from control and FC-loaded macrophages to cytochrome c immunoblot analysis. As shown in Fig. 6 (A and B), mitochondrially associated cytochrome c was decreased in macrophages loaded with FC for 4 or 5.5 h. To verify that these data were not simply due to less mitochondrial protein in the FC lane, we showed that the mitochondrial preparations from these control and FC-loaded macrophages contain"

In this study, we analyzed the biological activity and intracellular signaling of adenosine by using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction assays to investigate mRNA expression of A(1), A(2a) and A(3) adenosine receptors in immature and mature human DCs. Functional experiments on adenosine stimulation showed chemotaxis, intracellular calcium transients, and actin polymerization, but no activation of adenylate cyclase in immature DCs. Experiments with receptor isotype-selective agonists and antagonists as well as pertussis toxin revealed that chemotaxis, calcium transients, and actin polymerization were mediated via G(i-) or G(0-)protein-coupled A(1) and A(3) receptors. Maturation of DCs induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) resulted in down-regulation of A(1) and A(3) receptor mRNAs, although A(2a) receptor mRNA was still expressed. However, in LPS-differentiated DCs, adenosine and an A(2a) receptor agonist stimulated adenylate cyclase activity, enhanced intracellular cAMP levels, and inhibited interleukin 12 (IL-12) production. These effects could be completely prevented by pretreatment with A(2) receptor antagonist. These findings strongly suggest that adenosine has important but distinct biological effects in DCs activity as a chemotaxin for immature DCs and as a modulator of IL-12 production in mature DCs. These effects can be explained by differential expression of adenosine receptor subtypes."

Although diverse pathological stimuli can provoke exocytotic release of mucin from secretory cells of the airway epithelium, mechanisms involved remain obscure. This report describes a new paradigm for the intracellular signaling mechanism regulating airway mucin secretion. Direct evidence is provided that the myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate (MARCKS) is a central regulatory molecule linking secretagogue stimulation at the cell surface to mucin granule release by differentiated normal human bronchial epithelial cells in vitro. Down-regulation of MARCKS expression or disruption of MARCKS function in these cells inhibits the secretory response to subsequent stimulation. The intracellular mechanism controlling this secretory process involves cooperative action of two separate protein kinases, protein kinase C and cGMP-dependent protein kinase. Upon stimulation, activated protein kinase C phosphorylates MARCKS, causing translocation of MARCKS from the plasma membrane to the cytoplasm, where it is then dephosphorylated by a protein phosphatase 2A that is activated by cGMP-dependent protein kinase, and associates with both actin and myosin. Dephosphorylated cytoplasmic MARCKS would also be free to interact with mucin granule membranes and thus could link granules to the contractile cytoskeleton, mediating their movement to the cell periphery and subsequent exocytosis.

These findings suggest several novel intracellular targets for pharmacological intervention in disorders involving aberrant secretion of respiratory mucin and may relate to other lesions involving exocytosis of membrane-bound granules in various cells and tissues. Mammalian airways are lined by a thin layer of mucus produced and secreted by airway epithelial (goblet) cells and submucosal glands. In diseases such as asthma, chronic bronchitis, and cystic fibrosis, hypersecretion of mucus is a common lesion. Excess mucus can contribute to obstruction, susceptibility to infection, and even to destruction of airway walls and contiguous tissues. The major components of mucus are mucin glycoproteins synthesized by secretory cells and stored within cytoplasmic membrane-bound granules. Upon appropriate stimulation, these granules are released via an exocytotic process in which the granules translocate to the cell periphery where the granule membranes fuse with the plasma membrane, allowing for luminal secretion of the contents. Despite the obvious pathophysiological importance of this process, intracellular signaling mechanisms linking stimulation at the cell surface to mucin granule release have not been elucidated. It is known that a wide variety of agents and inflammatory/humoral mediators can provoke mucin secretion. These include cholinergic agonists, lipid mediators, oxidants, cytokines, neuropeptides, ATP and UTP, bacterial products, neutrophil elastase, and inhaled pollutants (reviewed in Refs. 1Adler K.B.

Interestingly, many of these mucin secretagogues are also known to activate several protein kinases, and studies examining the regulation of excess secretion of mucin by airway epithelial cells from various species have consistently implicated involvement of either protein kinase C (PKC) 1PKC, protein kinase C; PKG, cGMP-dependent protein kinase; PKA, protein kinase A; MANS, myristoylated N-terminal sequence; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; PSD, phosphorylation site domain; 8-Br-GMP, 8-bromo-cyclic GMP; RNS, random N-terminal sequence; MARCKS, myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate; NHBE, normal human bronchial epithelial; PP2A, protein phosphatase 2A; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. 1PKC, protein kinase C; PKG, cGMP-dependent protein kinase; PKA, protein kinase A; MANS, myristoylated N-terminal sequence; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; PSD, phosphorylation site domain; 8-Br-GMP, 8-bromo-cyclic GMP; RNS, random N-terminal sequence; MARCKS, myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate; NHBE, normal human bronchial epithelial; PP2A, protein phosphatase 2A; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.(3Ko K.H.

However, coordinated interactions or “cross-talk” between these two protein kinases in regulation of mucin secretion have not been demonstrated, nor have signaling events downstream of protein kinase activation that ultimately lead to the exocytotic release of mucin granules been elucidated. Previously, we reported (8Krunkosky T.M. Fischer B.M. Martin L.D. Jones N. Akley N.J. Adler K.B. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2000; 22: 685-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) development of a procedure to culture normal human bronchial epithelial (NHBE) cells in an air/liquid interface system in which the cells differentiate to a heterogeneous population containing secretory (goblet), ciliated, and basal cells that mimic their in vivo appearance and function. These cell cultures provide an ideal in vitro model system to study mechanisms regulating mucin secretion from human airway epithelium. This report presents direct evidence demonstrating that the myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate (MARCKS), a widely distributed PKC substrate for which a specific biological function has yet to be identified, is a key regulatory molecule mediating mucin granule release by NHBE cells. Secretion of mucin from these cells is maximized by activation of both PKC and PKG, and MARCKS serves as the point of convergence for coordinating the actions of these two protein kinases to control mucin granule release. The mechanism appears to involve PKC-dependent phosphorylation of MARCKS, which releases MARCKS from the plasma membrane into the cytoplasm, where it is in turn dephosphorylated by a protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) that is activated by PKG. This dephosphorylation would allow MARCKS to regain its membrane-binding capability (9Seykora J.T. Myat M.M. Allen L.A.H. Ravetch J.V. Aderem A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18797-18802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 10Swierczynski S.L. Blackshear P.J. J. Biol.

Sci. 1995; 20: 272-276Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar), enabling its attachment to membranes of cytoplasmic mucin granules. In addition, MARCKS interacts with actin and myosin in the cytoplasm and thus could tether the granules to the cellular contractile apparatus, mediating subsequent granule movement and exocytosis. Expansion, cryopreservation, and culture of NHBE cells in the air/liquid interface were performed as described previously (8Krunkosky T.M. Fischer B.M. Martin L.D. Jones N. Akley N.J. Adler K.B. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2000; 22: 685-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Briefly, NHBE cells (Clonetics, San Diego, CA) were seeded in vented T75 tissue culture flasks (500 cells/cm2) and cultured until cells reached 75–80% confluence. Cells were then dissociated by trypsin/EDTA and frozen as passage-2. Air/liquid interface culture was initiated by seeding passage-2 cells (2 × 104 cells/cm2) in Transwell® clear culture inserts (Costar, Cambridge, MA) that were thinly coated with rat tail collagen, type I (Collaborative Biomedical, Bedford, MA). Cells were cultured submerged in medium in a humidified 95% air, 5% CO2 environment for 5–7 days until nearly confluent. At that time, the air/liquid interface was created by removing the apical medium and feeding cells basalaterally. Medium was renewed daily thereafter. Cells were cultured for an additional 14 days to allow full differentiation. Before collection of “base line” and “test” mucin samples, the accumulated mucus at the apical surface of the cells was removed by washing with phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.2. To collect the base-line secretion, cells were incubated with medium alone, and secreted mucin in the apical medium was collected and reserved. Cells were rested for 24 h and then exposed to medium containing the selected stimulatory and/or inhibitory reagents (or appropriate controls), after which secreted mucin was collected and reserved as the test sample. Incubation times for the base line and the test were the same but varied depending on the test reagent utilized. Both base line and test secretions were analyzed by ELISA using an antibody capture method described previously (12Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 570-573Google Scholar). The primary antibody for this assay was 17Q2 (Babco, Richmond, CA), a monoclonal antibody that reacts specifically with a carbohydrate epitope on human airway mucins (13Lin H. Carlson D.M. St. George J.A. Plopper C.G. Wu R. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1989; 1: 41-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The ratio of test/base-line mucin, similar to a “secretory index” reported previously (14Wright D.T. Fischer B.M. Li C. Rochelle L.G. Akley N.J. Adler K.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: L854-L861PubMed Google Scholar), was used to quantify mucin secretion, allowing each culture dish to serve as its own control and thus minimizing deviation caused by variability among culture wells. Levels of mucin secretion were reported as percentage of the medium control. When labeling with [32P]phosphate, cells were preincubated for 2 h in phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin and then labeled with 0.1 mCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate (9000 Ci/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 2 h. For labeling with [3H]myristic acid or 3H-amino acids, cells were incubated overnight in medium containing 50 µCi/ml [3H]myristic acid (49 Ci/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) or 0.2 mCi/ml [3H]leucine (159 Ci/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) plus 0.4 mCi/ml [3H]proline (100 Ci/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Following labeling, cells were exposed to stimulatory reagents for 5 min. When an inhibitor was used, cells were preincubated with the inhibitor for 15 min prior to stimulation. At the end of the treatments, cells were lysed in a buffer containing 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm benzamidine, 10 µg/ml pepstatin A, and 10 µg/ml leupeptin. The radiolabeling efficiency in each culture was determined by trichloroacetic acid precipitation and scintillation counting. Immunoprecipitation of MARCKS protein was carried out according to the method of Spizz and Blackshear (15Spizz G. Blackshear P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 553-562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) using cell lysates containing equal counts/min. Precipitated proteins were resolved by 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and visualized by autoradiography. Anti-human MARCKS antibody (2F12) and nonimmune control antibody (6F6) used in this assay were provided by Dr. Perry Blackshear (NIEHS, Research Triangle Park, NC). To assess MARCKS or MARCKS-associated protein complexes in different subcellular fractions, radiolabeled and treated cells were scraped into a homogenization buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm benzamidine, 10 µg/ml pepstatin A, 10 µg/ml leupeptin) and then disrupted by nitrogen cavitation (800 pounds/square inch for 20 min at 4 °C). Cell lysates were centrifuged at 600 × g for 10 min at 4 °C to remove nuclei and unbroken cells. Post-nuclear supernatants were separated into membrane and cytosol fractions by ultracentrifugation at 400,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The membrane pellet was solubilized in the lysis buffer by sonication. Immunoprecipitation was then carried out as described above. Both the myristoylated N-terminal sequence (MANS) and the random N-terminal sequence (RNS) peptides were synthesized at Genemed Synthesis, Inc. (San Francisco, CA), then purified by high pressure liquid chromatography (>95% pure), and confirmed by mass spectroscopy with each showing one single peak with an appropriate molecular mass. The MANS peptide consisted of sequence identical to the first 24 amino acids of MARCKS, i.e. the myristoylated N-terminal region that mediates MARCKS insertion into membranes (9Seykora J.T. Myat M.M.

The corresponding control peptide (RNS) contained the same amino acid composition as the MANS but arranged in random order, MA-GTAPAAEGAGAEVKRASAEAKQAF. The presence of the hydrophobic myristate moiety in these synthetic peptides enhances their permeability to the plasma membranes, enabling the peptides to be taken up readily by cells. To determine the effects of these peptides on mucin secretion, cells were preincubated with the peptides for 15 min prior to addition of secretagogues, and mucin secretion was then measured by ELISA. MARCKS antisense oligonucleotide and its corresponding control oligonucleotide were synthesized at Biognostik GmbH (Gottingen, Germany). NHBE cells were treated with 5 µm antisense or control oligonucleotide apically for 3 days (in the presence of 2 µg/ml lipofectin for the first 24 h). Cells were then incubated with secretagogues, and mucin secretion was measured by ELISA. Total RNA and protein were isolated from treated cells. MARCKS mRNA was assessed by Northern hybridization according to conventional procedures using human MARCKS cDNA (provided by Dr. Perry Blackshear, NIEHS, Research Triangle Park, NC) as a probe. MARCKS protein level was determined by Western blot using purified anti-MARCKS IgG1 (clone 2F12) as the primary detection antibody. The phosphorylation site domain (PSD) of MARCKS contains the PKC-dependent phosphorylation sites and the actin filament-binding site (16Hartwig J.H. Thelen M. Rosen A. Janmey P.A. Nairn A.C. Aderem A. Nature. 1992; 356: 618-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar). To construct a PSD-deleted MARCKS cDNA, two fragments flanking the PSD sequence (coding for 25 amino acids) were generated by polymerase chain reaction and then ligated through the XhoI site that was attached to the 5′-ends of oligonucleotide primers designed for the polymerase chain reaction. The resultant mutant cDNA and the wild-type MARCKS cDNA were each inserted into a mammalian expression vector pcDNA4/TO (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Isolated recombinant constructs were confirmed by restriction digests and DNA sequencing. HBE1 is a papilloma virus-transformed human bronchial epithelial cell line (17Yankaskas J.R. Haizlip J.E. Conrad M. Koval D. Lazarowski E. Paradiso A.M. Rinehart Jr., C.A. Sarkadi B. Schlegel R. Boucher R.C. Am. J.

Transfection of HBE1 cells was carried out using the Effectene transfection reagent (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, differentiated HBE1 cells grown in air/liquid interface were dissociated by trypsin/EDTA and re-seeded in 12-well culture plates at 1 × 105cells/cm2. After overnight incubation, cells were transfected with the wild-type MARCKS cDNA, the PSD-truncated MARCKS cDNA, or vector DNA. Cells were cultured for 48 h to allow gene expression and then exposed to secretagogues and mucin secretion measured by ELISA. All transfections were carried out in the presence of pcDNA4/TO/lacZ plasmid (Invitrogen) (DNA ratio 6:1, total 1 µg DNA, ratio of DNA to Effectene reagent = 1:25) to monitor variations in transfection efficiency. Results showed no significant difference in β-galactosidase activities in cell lysates isolated from the transfected cells, indicating similar transfection efficiency among different DNA constructs (data not shown). PP1 and PP2A activities were measured using a protein phosphatase assay system (Life Technologies, Inc.) as described (18Huang X.C. Sumners C. Richards E.M. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1996; 396: 209-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) with modification. Briefly, NHBE cells were treated with 8-Br-cGMP or medium alone for 5 min. Cells were then scraped into a lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.1% β-mecaptoethanol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mmbenzamidine, 10 µg/ml pepstatin A, 10 µg/ml leupeptin) and disrupted by sonication for 20 s at 4 °C. Cell lysates were centrifuged and the supernatants saved for phosphatase activity assay. The assay was performed using 32P-labeled phosphorylase A as a substrate. Released 32Pi was counted by scintillation. The protein concentration of each sample was determined by the Bradford assay. PP2A activity was expressed as the sample total phosphatase activity minus the activity remaining in the presence of 1 nm okadaic acid. PP1 activity was expressed as the difference between the activities remaining in the presence of 1 nm and 1 µm okadaic acid, respectively. Protein phosphatase activities were reported as nmol of Pireleased per min/mg total protein. All reagents used in treating NHBE cells were examined for cytotoxicity by measuring the total release of lactate dehydrogenase from the cells. The assay was carried out using the Promega Cytotox 96 Kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. All experiments were performed with reagents at non-cytotoxic concentrations. Data were analyzed for significance using one-way analysis of variance with Bonferroni post-test corrections. Differences between treatments were considered significant at p < 0.05. To determine the potential role of PKC and/or PKG in the mucin secretory process, NHBE cells were exposed to the following two specific protein kinase activators: the phorbol ester, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), for activation of PKC, and the nonhydrolyzable cGMP analogue, 8-Br-cGMP, for activation of PKG. Preliminary studies examining mucin secretion in response to PMA stimulation at various concentrations for different times (up to 1 µm for 2 h) indicated that activation of PKC alone did not induce significant mucin secretion from NHBE cells, although a moderate secretory response was repeatedly observed at PMA concentrations higher than 100 nm (0.05 <p < 0.1). Also, the cells did not respond to the cGMP analogues at concentrations as high as 500 µm for up to 2 h of exposure. However, a combination of PMA + 8-Br-cGMP, affecting dual activation of PKC and PKG, provoked a rapid increase in secretion, approximately doubling it within 15 min of exposure (Fig.1A). This secretory response induced by PMA + 8-Br-cGMP was concentration-dependent, with maximal stimulation at 100 nm PMA + 1 µm8-Br-cGMP (Fig. 1B). UTP is a well defined pathophysiologically relevant mucin secretagogue (19Lethem M.I. Dowell M.L. Van Scott M. Yankaskas J.R. Egan T. Boucher R.C. Davis C.W. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1993; 9: 315-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Our preliminary studies showed that UTP (100 µm) could induce a significant increase in mucin secretion from NHBE cells after a 2-h exposure. To determine whether PKC and PKG were involved in regulation of mucin secretion in response to a pathophysiological stimulus, effects of PKC/PKG inhibitors on UTP-induced mucin secretion were investigated. NHBE cells were preincubated with various inhibitors for 15 min and then exposed to UTP (100 µm) plus the inhibitor for 2 h, and secreted mucin was measured by ELISA. The results indicated that mucin secretion provoked by UTP similarly required both PKC and PKG activities, as the secretory response was attenuated independently by the PKC inhibitor calphostin C (500 nm), the PKG inhibitorRp-8-Br-PET-cGMP (10 µm), or the soluble guanylyl cyclase (GC-S) inhibitor LY83583 (50 µm) but not by the protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitor KT5720 (500 nm) (Fig. 1C). Apparently, mucin secretion in NHBE cells is regulated by a signaling mechanism involving both PKC and PKG. To address the signaling mechanism downstream of protein kinase activation, we turned our attention to a specific cellular substrate of PKC, MARCKS protein, that might play a role in linking kinase activation to granule release. We first confirmed the presence of MARCKS in NHBE cells by [3H]myristic acid-labeled immunoprecipitation assay. As illustrated in Fig.2A, MARCKS was expressed in NHBE cells, and the majority of this protein was membrane-associated under unstimulated conditions. Then a role for MARCKS as a key regulatory component of the mucin secretory pathway was demonstrated in three different ways. NHBE cells were preincubated with either the MANS or the RNS peptide (1–100 µm) for 15 min, and then PMA (100 nm) + 8-Br-cGMP (1 µm) or UTP (100 µm) was added, and cells were incubated for an additional 15 min or 2 h, respectively. Mucin secretion was measured by ELISA. As shown in Fig. 2B, incubation of NHBE cells with the MANS peptide resulted in a concentration-dependent suppression of mucin secretion in response to PKC/PKG activation or UTP stimulation, whereas the control peptide (RNS) did not affect secretion at these same concentrations. Effects of the MANS peptide were not related to cytotoxicity or general repression of cellular metabolic activity, as neither the MANS nor the RNS peptide affected lactate dehydrogenase release or [3H]deoxyglucose uptake by the cells (data not shown). To demonstrate further MARCKS as a key signaling component of the mucin secretory pathway, the effect of an antisense oligonucleotide directed against MARCKS on mucin secretion was examined. As illustrated in Fig.3, this antisense oligonucleotide down-regulated both mRNA and protein levels of MARCKS in NHBE cells and significantly attenuated mucin secretion induced by PMA + 8-Br-cGMP, whereas a control oligonucleotide had no effect. Transfection of HBE1 cells with the PSD-truncated MARCKS cDNA resulted in significant inhibition of mucin secretion in response to PMA + 8-Br-cGMP stimulation, whereas transfection with the wild-type MARCKS cDNA or the vector DNA had no effect (Fig. 4). To reveal molecular events by which MARCKS links kinase activation to mucin secretion, phosphorylation of MARCKS in response to PKC/PKG activation was investigated in depth. As illustrated in Fig. 5A, PMA (100 nm) induced a significant increase (3–4-fold) in MARCKS phosphorylation in NHBE cells, and this phosphorylation was attenuated by the PKC inhibitor calphostin C (500 nm). Once phosphorylated, MARCKS was translocated from the plasma membrane to the cytoplasm (Fig. 5B). Activation of PKG by 8-Br-cGMP (1 µm), another kinase activation event necessary for provoking mucin secretion, did not lead to MARCKS phosphorylation, but, in fact, the opposite effect was observed: MARCKS phosphorylation induced by PMA was reversed by 8-Br-cGMP (Fig.6A). This effect of 8-Br-cGMP was not due to suppression of PKC activity, as the PMA-induced phosphorylation could be reversed by subsequent addition of 8-Br-cGMP to the cells (Fig. 6B). Therefore, PKG activation clearly resulted in dephosphorylation of MARCKS.Figure 6PKG induces dephosphorylation of MARCKS by activating PP2A. NHBE cells were labeled with [32P]orthophosphate and then exposed to the indicated reagents. MARCKS phosphorylation in response to the treatments was evaluated by immunoprecipitation assay. A, 8-Br-cGMP reversed MARCKS phosphorylation induced by PMA, and this effect of 8-Br-cGMP could be blocked by Rp-8-Br-PET-cGMP (PKG inhibitor) or okadaic acid (PP1/2A inhibitor). B,PMA-induced phosphorylation of MARCKS was reversed by subsequent exposure of cells to 8-Br-cGMP. Lane 1, medium alone for 8 min; lane 2, 100 nm PMA for 3 min; lane 3, 100 nm PMA for 3 min and then with 1 µm 8-Br-cGMP for 5 min; lane 4, 100 nm PMA for 8 min; lane 5, medium alone for 3 min and then 100 nm PMA + 1 µm 8-Br-cGMP for 5 min. C, 8-Br-cGMP-induced MARCKS dephosphorylation was attenuated by fostriecin in a concentration-dependent manner. ◒ from left to right: 500, 100, 10, and 1 nm fostriecin; the last lane: 500 nm fostriecin alone.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Further investigation showed that PKG-induced MARCKS dephosphorylation was blocked by 500 nm okadaic acid, a protein phosphatase (type 1 and/or 2A (PP1/2A)) inhibitor (Fig. 6A, lane 6). Thus, it appeared that the dephosphorylation was mediated by PP1 and/or PP2A. To define the subtype of protein phosphatase involved, a novel and more specific inhibitor of PP2A, fostriecin (IC50 = 3.2 nm) (20Walsh A.H. Cheng A. Honkanen R.E. FEBS Lett. 1997; 416: 230-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), was utilized in additional phosphorylation studies. As illustrated in Fig.6C, fostriecin inhibited PKG-induced MARCKS dephosphorylation in a concentration-dependent manner (1–500 nm), suggesting that PKG induced the dephosphorylation via activation of PP2A. To confirm further activation of PP2A by PKG in NHBE cells, cytosolic PP1 and PP2A activities were determined after exposure of the cells to 8-Br-cGMP. PP2A activity was increased approximately 3-fold (from 0.1 to 0.3 nmol/min/mg proteins,p < 0.01) at concentrations of 8-Br-cGMP as low as 0.1 µm, whereas PP1 activity remained unchanged. These data clearly indicate that PP2A is activated by PKG and is responsible for the dephosphorylation of MARCKS. Accordingly, this PP2A activity appeared critical for mucin secretion to occur; when PKG-induced MARCKS dephosphorylation was blocked by okadaic acid or fostriecin, the secretory response to PKC/PKG activation or UTP stimulation was ameliorated (Fig. 7). Radiolabeled immunoprecipitation assay revealed that MARCKS associated with two other proteins (∼200 and ∼40 kDa) in the cytoplasm (Fig. 8). Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization/time of flight mass spectrometry/internal sequence analysis indicated that these two MARCKS-associated proteins were myosin (heavy chain, non-muscle type A) and actin, respectively. Transformed cell lines of airway epithelium tend to contain altered signaling pathways, and cell lines or nondifferentiated cells may not respond to exogenous stimuli in a manner similar to differentiated cells in vivo. The NHBE cells utilized in the present study were cultured at the air/liquid interface, resulting in fully differentiated primary cell cultures that maintained a well documented structure and function similar to the in vivo one (8Krunkosky T.M.

This syndrome is characterized by destructive autoimmune diseases of the endocrine organs, chronic candidiasis of mucous membranes, and ectodermal disorders.

The AIRE gene has recently been cloned by two independent groups of investigators (5The Finnish-German Autoimmune Polyendocrinopathy Candidiasis Ectodermal Dystrophy Consortium Nat.

TheAIRE gene consists of 14 exons coding for a 2445-base pair mRNA transcript, and the translated product is expected to have 545 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 57.5 kDa. The predicted AIRE protein has several domains indicative of a transcriptional regulator protein (6Nagamine K. Peterson P. Scott H.S. Kudoh J. Minoshima S. Heino M. Krohn K.J.

AIRE harbors two zinc fingers of plant homeodomain (PHD) type. A putative DNA binding domain named SAND as well as four nuclear receptor binding LXXLL motifs, an inverted LXXLL domain, and a variant of the latter (FXXLL) hint that this protein functions as a transcription coactivator (5The Finnish-German Autoimmune Polyendocrinopathy Candidiasis Ectodermal Dystrophy Consortium Nat.

Sci. 1998; 23: 242-244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a highly conserved N-terminal 100-amino acid domain in AIRE has a significant homology to the homogenously staining (HSR) domain of Sp100 and Sp140 proteins (7Gibson T.J. Ramu C. Gemund C. Aasland R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 242-244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). This domain has been shown to function as a dimerization domain in several Sp-100 related proteins (8Seeler J.S. Marchio A. Sitterlin D. Transy C. Dejean A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7316-7321Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). At the subcellular level, AIRE can be found in the cell nucleus in a speckled pattern in domains resembling promyelocytic leukemia nuclear bodies, also known as ND10, nuclear dots, or potential oncogenic domains, associated with the AIRE homologous nuclear proteins Sp100, Sp140, and Lysp100 (9Bjorses P. Pelto-Huikko M. Kaukonen J. Aaltonen J. Peltonen L. Ulmanen I. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 259-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Interestingly, it has recently been shown that AIRE can activate transcription from a reporter gene when fused to a heterologous DNA binding domain. This activation required the full-length protein or the presence of more than one activation domain. A glutathioneS-transferase pull-down assay showed that AIRE formed homodimers in vitro, probably through the N-terminal domain (amino acids 1–207) or through the minimal 1–100 amino acid domain resembling Sp-100. It has also been shown that AIRE interacts in vitro with CREB-binding protein (CBP) through the CH1 and CH3 conserved domains, which has led the investigators to suggest that the transcriptional activities of AIRE might be mediated through its physical interaction with the common coactivator CBP (10Pitkanen J. Doucas V. Sternsdorf T. Nakajima T. Aratani S. Jensen K. Will H. Vahamurto P. Ollila J. Vihinen M. Scott H.S. Antonarakis S.E. Kudoh J. Shimizu N. Krohn K. Peterson P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16802-16809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). CBP is a key coactivator that modulates the transcriptional regulation dependent on adenylate cyclase-signaling pathway in eukaryotes. The signal processing is mediated by a family of cyclic AMP-responsive nuclear factors, including CREB, cAMP response element modulator (CREM), and activating transcription factor 1 (ATF-1). These factors contain the basic domain/leucine zipper motifs and bind as dimers to cAMP-responsive elements (CREs). The activation function of CRE-binding proteins in turn is modulated by several kinase-dependent phosphorylations and is mediated by coactivators such as CBP and p300 (11De Cesare D. Sassone-Corsi P. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 2000; 64: 343-369Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although it is important to note that the interaction of AIRE with CBP might influence signal transduction mediated by cAMP-responsive nuclear factors, some of the structural properties of AIRE are suggestive of its function beyond the suspected transactivation. The presence of two PHD zinc fingers and a leucine zipper was the focus of our attention. The objectives of the present study were 1) to verify whether recombinant human AIRE oligomerizes in vitro and 2) to examine the possibility of AIRE possessing DNA binding properties. In this paper, we report that AIRE forms homodimers and homotetramersin vitro and that both the dimer and tetramer forms of AIRE possess DNA binding activity. We further demonstrate that AIRE exists in oligomerized forms in vivo and that phosphorylation of AIRE by cAMP-dependent PKA and/or PKC could trigger its dimerization. The full-length AIRE (amino acids 1–545) was amplified by polymerase chain reaction. The fragment was cloned into pET32 containing a thioredoxin tag (Novagen) for 6×His fusion protein expression. Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) were transformed and selected on ampicillin. Starting with a single colony, 500 ml of an overnight culture of a positive clone was set up. The expression of the AIRE gene was induced with 10 µm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and the culture was continued for 3 h. The cells were harvested, and the recombinant protein was purified using the B-PER 6× histidine fusion protein purification system (Pierce) following the manufacturer's instructions with slight modifications. Briefly, the cells harvested from fresh induction were resuspended in 20 ml of B-PER reagent by pipetting up and down until the cell suspension was homogenous. The homogenous suspension was shaken gently at room temperature for 10 min. The soluble proteins were separated from the insoluble fraction by centrifugation at 27,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was separated into two aliquots of 10 ml each and loaded onto two nickel-chelated columns equilibrated with B-PER reagent. The columns were washed three times with the wash buffers following the instructions of the manufacturer. The elution was performed on an imidazole gradient (0.1–1×), and 20 fractions of 0.5 ml each were collected. The fractions were analyzed on SDS-PAGE, the fractions containing the recombinant AIRE were pooled, and the protein concentration was adjusted to 10 µg/µl. Protein concentrations were determined by BCA protein assay reagent (Pierce) using the standard protocol. This preparation is designated as AIRE monomer. A 20-ml fraction of the eluate pool containing AIRE was resuspended in 5 volumes of ice-cold water containing 10 mm benzamidine hydrochloride. Guanidine hydrochloride and sodium phosphate (pH 7.0) were added such that the final concentrations of 6 m guanidine and 10 mmphosphate were obtained, and the mixture was allowed to stir at room temperature for 2 h. The denatured soluble fraction was then diluted 10-fold over the course of 2 h into 1 liter of ice-cold oxidation, refold buffer containing Tris-HCl (pH 9.0), 1 murea, and a redox couple (3 mml-cysteine, 0.3 mm cystamine dihydrochloride). The solution was kept at 4 °C for 20 h. The solution was then concentrated, and buffer was exchanged against 10 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.0) containing 2 m urea using Centricon centrifugal filtration device (Millipore) with a molecular weight cut-off of 10,000. This preparation was then adjusted to pH 5.2 with acetic acid and allowed to stir at 4 °C overnight. The solution was clarified by centrifugation, adjusted to pH 8.0, and concentrated, and the buffer was exchanged against Tris buffer (pH 8.5) using Millipore centrifugal filtration device. As a final refolding step, the pH of the preparation was adjusted to pH 5.0 with acetic acid, and buffer exchange was performed with 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer containing 150 mm NaCl (pH 7.2). The final volume of the preparation was adjusted so as to have a protein concentration of 10 µg/µl. This preparation is designated as refolded AIRE. Total IgG from the sera of rabbits immunized with recombinant human AIRE (rhAIRE) was purified using IgG purification kit (Pierce) with manufacturer's instructions. The IgG was oriented on a CarbolinkTM gel employing an immobilization chemistry that used sodium periodate to oxidize carbohydrates located on the Fc portion of antibody molecules, converting vicinal hydroxyl groups to reactive aldehyde groups. These aldehyde groups were allowed to react with the hydrazide groups of the resin to form hydrazone bonds. The resin is designated as immobilized anti-AIRE hereafter. IgG recovered from non-immunized animals were also immobilized in a similar fashion, which is designated as immobilized normal rabbit IgG. Thymus tissues from four immature B6 mice were excised and homogenized in radioimmune precipitation buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 0.5% sodium deoxycholate) containing 0.1% phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 ml of buffer/mg of fresh tissue weight). The tissue homogenate was cleared by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was recovered and pre-cleared with immobilized normal rabbit IgG (60 µl of hydrated beads/1 ml of lysate). The mixture was incubated for 1 h at 4 °C on a rocker. The supernatant was recovered after centrifugation at 16,000 × g (5 min) and mixed with immobilized anti-AIRE antibody. The mixture was incubated overnight at 4 °C on a rocker. After incubation, the preparation was centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 5 min to recover the beads. The beads were washed five times with 1 ml of fresh radioimmune precipitation buffer each time. Bound AIRE recovered from the immunocomplex was batch-eluted using a 100–500 mm glycine gradient and buffer-exchanged with phosphate-buffered saline. For native PAGE, the protein samples were diluted 1:4 with native gel loading buffer (63 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 10% glycerol, and 0.005% bromphenol blue). Approximately 10 µg of protein/well was loaded onto a native discontinuous gel (4% stacking gel (pH 6.8) and 12% running gel, pH 8.3). Neither the gel nor the running buffer contained SDS. For denaturing gel electrophoresis, the protein samples were diluted 1:4 with SDS reducing buffer (63 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 2% 2-mercaptoethanol, and 0.005% bromphenol blue). The samples were boiled for 5 min at 95 °C and loaded onto discontinuous SDS gels containing 8 m urea (4% stacking gel (pH 6.8) and 12% running gel (pH 8.3)). The gels were run in TGS buffer (192 mm Tris, 25 mm glycine, and 0.1% SDS) on a MiniProtean III vertical electrophoresis system (Bio-Rad) at 100 V for 3 h. The separated proteins were either stained with Coomassie Blue or were further processed for transfer onto Sequiblot PVDF (0.2 µm, Bio-Rad). For electroblotting, the gels were recovered and introduced into the transfer module. The proteins were transferred onto a PVDF membrane pre-wet in methanol and equilibrated in the transfer buffer using a Mini Transblot cell (Bio-Rad). The transfer buffer had the following composition: 40% methanol (v/v), 25 mm Tris, and 190 mm glycine (pH 8.2). The transfer was performed at 30 mA of constant current for 12–16 h, after which the PVDF membrane was recovered and air-dried. For the development of blots, the membranes were pre-wet in methanol and then incubated in the Opti-4CN blocking reagent (Bio-Rad) for 1 h at 37 °C followed by extensive washing in phosphate-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween 20 at room temperature. The membranes were incubated with appropriate primary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. After incubation, the membranes were washed with three changes of phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1% Tween 20 and then incubated with goat anti-rabbit IgG-horseradish peroxidase at a dilution of 1:5000. The membranes were washed extensively after incubation and then developed with amplified Opti-4CN reagents (Bio-Rad) following the recommendations of the manufacturer. N-terminal microsequencing of the 54-, 110-, and 220-kDa bands affinity-purified from mouse thymus on anti-AIRE columns was performed as follows. 100–300 mmglycine (pH 2.5) eluates from immobilized anti-AIRE immunocomplexes were pooled and separated on native-PAGE polymerized for 18 h after the protocol described in the earlier section. The separated proteins were transferred onto a PVDF membrane (Millipore pSQ) pre-wet in methanol and equilibrated in the transfer buffer (0.1 mMES buffer (pH 6.0) containing 40% v/v methanol). The transfer was performed at 30 mA of constant current for 12–16 h, after which the PVDF membrane was recovered and washed extensively in deionized water. The membranes were briefly stained in Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 for 1 min and de-stained in two changes of de-staining solution. The membranes were dried, and bands were excised. The excised bands were subjected to Edman degradation and the PTH derivatives were detected on a microbore liquid chromatography system. The oligonucleotides used in this study are listed in Table I. The oligonucleotides were end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP after a standard T4 polynucleotide kinase reaction. The phosphorylation reaction was continued for 30 min at 37 °C, after which the reaction was stopped by the addition of 1 µl of 0.5 m EDTA/10 µl of total reaction volume. The unincorporated label was removed using QIAQUICK nucleotide removal kit (Qiagen) following the instructions of the manufacturer. The labeled oligonucleotides were eluted in 100 µl of TE buffer. The specific activities of the labeled oligonucleotides were measured and were confirmed to be close to 20,000 cpm/100 fmol before they were used in gel-shift assays.Table IOligonucleotides used for gel shift assays detailed in this studyNameSequence of consensus oligonucleotidesMutation in nonconsensusAP-1CGCTTGATGACTCAGCCGGAACA → TGATF/CREBAGAGATTGCCTGACGTCAGAGAGCTAGAC → TGNF-E2TGGGGAACCTGTGCTGAGTCACTGGAGGA → AGSP1ATTCGATCGGGGCGGGGCGAGCGG → TTEGRGAATTCAGCGGGGGCGAGCGGGGGCGAGG → TAYY1GGTCTCCATTTTGAAGCGGAACCA → TTGGATACACTTGATAACAGAAAGTGATAACTCTGA → CTTGGTTATTAATTGGTTATATTGGTTATGTTATTAATTGGTTAGGATTGGTTATATTGGTTAGATTGGTTA Open table in a new tab Gel shift assays were performed with purified AIRE (100 pm/reaction), and radiolabeled double-stranded oligonucleotides were prepared as stated above. The oligonucleotides used in this study are listed in Table I. The protein preparations were preincubated in binding buffer (10 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mmMgCl2, 4% glycerol) in the presence of 0.05 mg/ml poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC). Competition studies were performed by the addition of 1.75 pmol of unlabeled double-stranded oligonucleotide into the preincubation step. DNA-protein complexes were formed by the addition of 0.175 pmol (40–100,000 cpm/liter) of probe and resolved by separation from unbound radiolabeled oligonucleotides through 6% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gels (acrylamide:bisacrylamide ratio, 80:1) containing 2.5% glycerol in 0.5× TBE (44.5 mm Tris, 44.5 mm boric acid, 1 mm EDTA) using a Protean II electrophoresis system (Bio-Rad). The gels were pre-run at 100 V for 30 min before loading of the binding reaction. After loading the samples, the DNA-protein complexes were separated by electrophoresis at 150 V for 3.5 h. All procedures were performed at room temperature. After electrophoresis, the gels were exposed to x-ray film (Fuji Film). Gel shift competition assays were performed by the introduction of a synthetic zinc finger peptide (ZIF 268) in the reaction. The basic reaction was set up as stated above, with a modification involving the addition of ZIF 268 at a concentration of 100 pm. This reaction was allowed to incubate for 15 min at room temperature, after which AIRE was introduced at concentrations ranging from 100 pm through 800 pm. Gel shift assays of these reactions were performed in the same fashion as discussed above. We determined the ability of purified recombinant AIRE to bind DNA employing two oligo libraries. The first library (N26 oligo library) had randomized a 26-mer stretch flanked by arms for PCR amplification. The second library (G2N7G2 library) had N9GGN7GGN6 sequence flanked by adapter sequence for PCR amplification. The libraries were PCR-amplified under standard conditions (melting at 94 °C for 2 min followed by cycling at 94 °C for 30 s, annealing at 63 °C for 30 s, and extension at 72 °C for 1 min; a final hold at 72 °C for 10 min was given for completion of chain elongation). After amplification, the PCR product was suspended in 1× binding buffer and incubated with purified and refolded rhAIRE for 1 h at room temperature with constant shaking. After this, anti-AIRE antibody (1:100 dilution) was added to the mixture, and the incubation was continued for an additional 1 h. Protein A-agarose with preblocked nonspecific binding sites (1:10 dilution) was added to the mixture, and the incubation was allowed to continue for 1 h. At the end of this final incubation, the suspension was centrifuged at 16,000 rpm on an Eppendorf centrifuge. The supernatant was carefully removed, and the pellet was washed 5 times with 1.5 ml of 1× binding buffer each time. The final pellet was resuspended in 1× TE. A 2-µl aliquot of the resuspended pellet was PCR-amplified under the settings mentioned above. The whole procedure was repeated 5 times as discussed earlier. After the last amplification, the PCR product was separated on a 3% agarose gel, and the band was eluted and cloned using pCR4-TOPO cloning kit for sequencing (Invitrogen). TOPO10 cells were transformed adopting a one-shot chemical transformation protocol. Thirty-two clones each were selected and sequenced from the AIRE-selected N26 library and the G2N7G2 library. Plasmid minipreps were made from the selected colonies and sequenced using M13 forward primer. The insert sequences were aligned. Two different controls were included in this experimentation. The first control involved the PCR amplification of G2N7G2 library (before selection by AIRE) and its cloning into pCR4-TOPO vector. Forty-four clones were sequenced, and the sequences were analyzed to evaluate the bias in the random areas of the oligonucleotides in this library (control 1). The second control involved the cloning of oligonucleotides selected by reagents excluding AIRE from the experimental reaction set-up (control 2). Relative binding affinity assays were performed in a manner similar to that outlined for gel-shift assays. In this assay, we constructed four independent sets of four reactions, each using hot oligonucleotides oligo-TGG, oligo-TG, oligo-GG, and oligo-G, respectively. Each set had a gel shift with the given oligonucleotide and competitions with the other three oligonucleotides. The concentrations of the protein, hot oligonucleotide, and competitors were the same as those in the gel-shift assays detailed earlier in this section. rhAIRE monomer was resuspended in kinase buffer containing 40 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 10 mm MgCl2, and 3 mmMnCl2. 100 µg/ml ATP was added into the suspension. The kinase reaction was initiated by the introduction of the corresponding protein kinases. We tested the phosphorylation of AIRE by Abl protein kinase (New England Biolabs), casein kinase I, casein kinase II (Promega Corp.), cAMP-dependent protein kinase A and PKC (Cell Signaling technology). The reactions were incubated for 30 min at 27 °C, after which AIRE was immunoprecipitated with anti-AIRE-agarose. The immunocomplexes were dissociated with 100 mm glycine buffer (pH 2.6), and the anti-AIRE-agarose conjugate was separated by centrifugation. The supernatant was neutralized with 100 mm Tris buffer (pH 10.0). The eluates were separated on native PAGE and transferred onto PVDF membranes. The membrane strips were probed with the corresponding anti-Tyr(P) or anti-Ser(P)/Thr(P) antibodies. One of the strips was probed with anti-AIRE antibody to verify the position of AIRE. The full-length sequence of human AIRE (GenBankTM accession number NM000383.1) was subjected to a global threading, and significant threading matches were filtered out considering high global and local Z scores. This process yielded a few templates for further use in homology modeling. The templates used include 11GSA, 1PYDA, 1OTCA, 1PRCH, 2RAMB, and 2YHX. Alignments were performed using the program package GCG, and the model was built using Insight II and Discover (Molecular Simulations Inc., San Diego, CA) and evaluated with Swissmodel program (12Schwede T. Diemand A. Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Res. Microbiol. 2000; 151: 107-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The full-length construct of human AIRE (hAIRE) in pet32 showed a very low basal level of expression of AIRE, which was augmented severalfold after induction with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (Fig.1A, lanes 2 and3). Because B-Per reagent could extract AIRE in the soluble fraction, as shown in lane 3, we discarded the pellet after confirming the efficiency of the recovery. The chelated nickel affinity chromatography followed by imidazole gradient elution produced a protein fraction at an estimated molecular size of 56 kDa, as represented in lane 4 (Fig. 1A), which shows a purified fraction of AIRE. This fraction is termed AIRE monomer for descriptive purposes. The processing of the rhAIRE under oxidation and refolding conditions brought about a major shift in the pattern of migration of this molecule (Fig. 1A, lane 5). Although a minor fraction of AIRE still appears at the 56-kDa position, the major bands appear at estimated molecular sizes of 110 and 220 kDa when the refolded rhAIRE was analyzed on native PAGE. Both these bands migrated to the 56-kDa position on SDS-PAGE in the presence of 8 murea (Fig. 1A, lane 6), suggesting the formation of dimers and tetramers of AIRE during the refolding process. Polyclonal antibodies raised in rabbit in our laboratory against the full-length rhAIRE recognized the AIRE in mouse thymus extracts on Western blots (Fig.1B, lane 1). Along with the expected 56-kDa band, we also observed the presence of anti-rhAIRE-positive bands at molecular weight positions of 110 and 220 kDa, suggesting the possible oligomerization of AIRE in vivo (Fig. 1B,lane 1). Both these high molecular weight bands were microsequenced, confirming that they are derivatives of AIRE (data not shown). A computer-based prediction (www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetPhos) of the properties of AIRE had indicated that this molecule is quite possibly phosphorylated at serine and/or at threonine at several locations, with one possible tyrosine phosphorylation site at Tyr-394. To verify this prediction, we immunoprecipitated AIRE from total protein extract of mouse thymus using anti-AIRE antibody immobilized on CarbolinkTM resin using a CarbolinkTM IgG Immobilization Kit (Pierce). Immunoprecipitated AIRE was recovered using a glycine gradient. The fractions were neutralized, separated on native PAGE, and analyzed on Western blots. Native immunoblots of the immunoprecipitated fractions probed with anti-AIRE antibody detected bands at 56, 110, and 220 kDa, indicating the presence of monomers, dimers, and tetramers of AIRE in tissue extracts (Fig. 1B, lane 1). Identical lanes were probed with anti-Ser(P)/Thr(P) (Fig. 1B,lane 2) and anti-Tyr(P) (Fig. 1B, lane 3) antibodies, which indicated that AIRE existed in a phosphorylated condition in mammalian tissues. Five different kinases (Abl protein kinase, CK1, CK2, cAMP-dependent PKA and PKC) were selected considering the predicted ability (www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetPhos) of one or all of them to phosphorylate recombinant human AIRE produced by prokaryotic expression. Abl protein kinase and the casein kinases used in this experiment could not bring about phosphorylation of rhAIRE in vitro (Fig. 1C, lanes 2–4). Interestingly, cAMP-dependent PKA brought about phosphorylation of rhAIRE (Fig. 1C, lane 5). To our surprise, we observed that the rhAIRE band shifted toward the 100-kDa position, indicating a possibility of dimerization of this molecule in response to phosphorylation. Protein kinase C also brought about phosphorylation of rhAIRE. Again, rhAIRE appeared to dimerize in response to phosphorylation although the monomer form of rhAIRE was also visible after the termination of the phosphorylation reaction (Fig. 1,lane 6). We screened seven consensus sequences known to be recognized by zinc finger/leucine zipper proteins (Table I) to examine the possibility of AIRE interacting with DNA through its zinc finger domains. In our initial attempts, we conducted gel shift assays with monomeric AIRE. None of the oligonucleotides brought about a gel shift when we used AIRE monomer in the assays (data not shown). Interestingly, the refolded recombinant protein showed a strong gel shift with EGR consensus, producing two bands corresponding to the respective dimer and tetramer positions of AIRE (Fig.2A, lane 2). The addition of a 10 m excess of cold consensus oligonucleotide brought about significant reduction in the intensity of the gel-shifted bands, signifying the specificity of the interaction (Fig.2A, lane 3). Furthermore, the use of a mutant EGR consensus with base replacements at the underlined positions (GAATTCAGCGGGGGCGAGCGGGGGCGA, GG → TA in mutant) did not bring about competitive removal of the gel-shifted bands (Fig. 2A, lane 4). Moreover, hot mutant EGR consensus also failed to show a gel-shifted band, confirming this observation (Fig. 2A, lane 5). This indicated the possible requirement of those underlined guanine residues in this oligonucleotide for its binding to AIRE. To further confirm that the zinc finge"

When using hierarchical clustering to classify breast tumors based upon variations in gene expression patterns, ∼4–5 distinct breast tumor subtypes were identified (1Perou C.M. Sørlie T.

In addition, it has been shown that these tumor subtypes were predictive of disease outcome (2Sørlie T. Perou C.M. Tibshirani R. Aas T. Geisler S. Johnsen H. Eisen M.B. van de Rijn M. Jeffrey S.S.

In the present study, we focus on one of the genes whose high expression correlated with a favorable patient outcome and whose expression pattern helped to define a breast tumor subtype that also expressed the estrogen receptor (ER).1 This gene encodes a novel member of the Ras superfamily of small GTPases that we have designated RERG. The mammalian Ras superfamily members serve as molecular switches to regulate a diverse array of cellular functions. These include control of cellular proliferation, differentiation, regulation of the actin cytoskeleton, membrane trafficking, and nuclear transport (3Macara I.G. Lounsbury K.M. Richards S.A.

Science. 1998; 280: 2074-2075Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Despite sequence differences between subfamily members, all Ras-related GTPases contain five highly conserved domains (G1-G5) and function as guanine nucleotide-dependent molecular switches. For example, the prototypic Ras proteins transduce signals for growth and differentiation by alternating between active guanosine triphosphate (GTP)-bound and inactive guanosine diphosphate (GDP)-bound conformational states (7Bourne H.R. Sanders D.A. McCormick F. Nature. 1991; 349: 117-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (2655) Google Scholar). When in their active GTP-bound state, Ras-related proteins interact through their effector domain with a variety of cellular targets to elicit their biological effects. Recently, several novel Ras-related GTPases have been identified that exhibit amino acid sequence features that distinguish them from Ras proteins (reviewed in Ref. 8Reuther G.W. Der C.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 157-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). The Rheb GTPases are conserved from human to yeast and are subject to regulated expression in response to a number of stimuli (9Urano J. Tabancay A.P. Yang W. Tamanoi F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11198-11206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 10Yamagata K. Sanders L.K. Kaufmann W.E. Yee W. Barnes C.A. Nathans D. Worley P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16333-16339Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although the function of Rheb in mammalian cells is unclear, the yeast Rheb homologue appears to have the ability to regulate cell cycle progression and arginine uptake. The strong amino acid identity of Rin and Rit proteins with Ras, particularly within their effector domains, suggest that Rit and Rin may share partially overlapping functions with Ras (11Wes P.D., Yu, M. Montell C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5839-5848Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 12Lee C.H. Della N.G. Chew C.E. Zack D.J. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 6784-6794Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Shao H. Kadono-Okuda K. Finlin B.S. Andres D.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 371: 207-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Finally,ARHI is an imprinted tumor suppressor gene in breast and ovarian carcinomas; expression of ARHI in cancer cells inhibited cell growth and was associated with down-regulation of cyclin D1 promoter activity and induction of p21WAF1/CIP1 (14Yu Y. Xu F. Peng H. Fang X. Zhao S. Li Y. Cuevas B. Kuo W.L. Gray J.W. Siciliano M. Mills G.B. Bast Jr., R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 214-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Identification of these atypical family members has expanded our understanding of the roles of Ras-superfamily GTP-binding proteins in cell physiology and suggests that they are likely to serve as functionally distinct regulators of as yet to be characterized signaling cascades. Here we report the identification of a novel member of the Ras superfamily of GTP-binding proteins that was discovered through microarray studies of human breast tumors. Because it is homologous to Ras and regulated in an estrogen-dependent manner, we have termed this gene RERG(r as-related andestrogen-regulated growth inhibitor). RERG has biochemical properties characteristic of the Ras superfamily, including an intrinsic ability to bind and hydrolyze GTP; however, overexpression of RERG results in a reduced rate of proliferation and a significant inhibition of both anchorage-dependent and anchorage-independent growth. All cDNA microarrays were produced and hybridized as described in Perou et al. (1Perou C.M. Sørlie T. Eisen M.B. van de Rijn M. Jeffrey S.S. Rees C.A. Pollack J.R. Ross D.T. Johnsen H. Akslen L.A.

For the MCF-7 estrogen “add back” experiments, the parental vector-only MCF-7 control cell line (MCF-7-pCDNA3) was grown to 50–70% confluency in RPMI + 10% fetal calf serum + penicillin/streptomycin, at which point the cells were switched to phenol red-free RPMI medium that contained 10% dextran-charcoal-stripped fetal calf serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT) plus penicillin/streptomycin for 48 h. Some of these estrogen-deprived cells were then cultured in 10−8mβ-17-estradiol (Sigma) for 4, 8, and 24 h. For the tamoxifen-treated samples, 70% confluent cultures of MCF-7-pCDNA3 in RPMI + 10% fetal calf serum + penicillin/streptomycin media containing phenol red were treated with either 1 or 6 μmtamoxifen (Sigma) for 48 h. mRNA was prepared from each sample using a FastTrack 2.0 mRNA kit (Invitrogen) and compared on 23,000-clone or 44,000-clone cDNA microarrays prepared at Stanford University (1Perou C.M. Sørlie T. Eisen M.B. van de Rijn M. Jeffrey S.S. Rees C.A. Pollack J.R. Ross D.T. Johnsen H. Akslen L.A. Fluge Ø. Pergamenschikov A. Williams C. Zhu S.X. Lønning P.E. Børresen-Dale A.-L. Brown P.O.

In the case of the tamoxifen-treated samples, the control untreated cells were labeled with Cy3 and compared with the tamoxifen-treated samples that were labeled with Cy5; for the estrogen add back experiments, the 48-h estrogen-deprived culture was labeled with Cy3 and compared with the estrogen-treated samples (Cy5). NIH 3T3 mouse fibroblasts were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% calf serum. MCF-7 human breast carcinoma cells used in RERG overexpression studies were maintained in α-modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. MCF-7 cells overexpressing wild type RERG or vector alone (designated MCF-7-Ha-RERG or MCF-7-pCDNA3) were generated by transfecting cells with either pCDNA3-Ha-RERG or pCDNA3. Stable MCF-7 transformants were selected for resistance to 0.5 mg/ml G418, and individual clones were isolated using cloning rings. All transfections were performed using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.). Human breast cell lines used in the Northern blot analyses were obtained from ATCC. The complete RERG gene cDNA sequence was determined (GenBankTM accession number AF339750). The RERG gene was amplified from IMAGE EST clone 28777 using primers that contain EcoRI-NdeI and BamHI restriction sites and was subcloned into the corresponding sites of the yeast expression vector pWHA, which contains a hemagglutinin (HA) epitope tag, to create pWHA-RERG. Next, HA-RERG was subcloned into the EcoRI-BamHI sites of the human expression vector pCDNA3, resulting in pCDNA3-HA-RERG. A full-length RERG expression construct for recombinant RERG protein production was generated using polymerase chain reaction to introduce a BamHI site immediately upstream of the initiator AUG and an XhoI site directly downstream of the 3′ stop codon. The polymerase chain reaction product was subcloned into the BamHI and XhoI sites of pET-32a (Novagen) to create pET32a-RERG. Oligonucleotide site-directed mutagenesis was used to generate the single amino acid substitution mutant RERGQ64L (pET32a-RERGQ64L). For localization studies in live cells, RERG in pKH3 was used as a polymerase chain reaction template to generate open reading frame cassettes for subcloning into pEGFP-C3 (CLONTECH). The cassettes contained 5′ EcoRI and 3′ BamHI restriction enzyme recognition sites and were directionally cloned downstream of and in-frame with the green fluorescent protein (GFP) tag of the vector to express GFP-RERG fusion protein. To analyze RERG expression in human breast derived cell lines, RNA was isolated from various cell lines by acid-phenol extraction as described (16Chirgwin J.M. Przybyla A.E. MacDonald R.J. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5294-5299Crossref PubMed Scopus (16610) Google Scholar). Total RNA (∼25 μ g) was resolved on 1.3% agarose/formaldehyde gel, denatured, and transferred to Hybond-N (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). [α-32P]dCTP-labeled RERG or GAPDH cDNA was prepared with the random prime kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), purified with Sephadex G50 NICK column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and hybridized to the RNA samples using PerfectHyb (Sigma). A similar process was used to probe a human multiple tissue Northern blot (CLONTECH). The recombinant plasmid pET32a-RERG was used for the expression of His6-thioredoxin-RERG fusion protein as described (17Shao H. Andres D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26914-26924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After purification on nickel nitrilotriacetic acid-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), RERG protein was exchanged into 50 mmTris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mmMg2+, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol using a G-25 desalting column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and stored in multiple aliquots at −70 °C. Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Recombinant RERG bound 0.12–0.18 mol of nucleotide/mol as measured by rapid filtration assay (13Shao H. Kadono-Okuda K. Finlin B.S. Andres D.A. Arch. Biochem.

RERG (1.5 μg) or heat-denatured RERG (95 °C for 5 min) (1.5 μg) was incubated in binding buffer (20 mm Tris pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 40 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 2 μm GTPγS (0.24 μCi/sample)) containing 1 mm EDTA for 1 min at 22 °C, and the free magnesium concentration was adjusted to 10 mm to initiate nucleotide binding. After incubation at 22 °C for the indicated times, aliquots were withdrawn and filtered immediately through BA85 filters (Schleicher and Schuell), and the amount of bound nucleotide was determined by scintillation counting. Assays to determine the concentration dependence and specificity of binding and monitor guanine nucleotide dissociation were performed as described (13Shao H. Kadono-Okuda K. Finlin B.S. Andres D.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 371: 207-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 18Finlin B.S. Shao H. Kadono-Okuda K. Guo N. Andres D.A. Biochem. J. 2000; 347: 223-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). GTP hydrolysis was quantitated by thin layer chromatography to resolve GDP and GTP (13Shao H. Kadono-Okuda K. Finlin B.S. Andres D.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 371: 207-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 18Finlin B.S. Shao H. Kadono-Okuda K. Guo N. Andres D.A. Biochem. J. 2000; 347: 223-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Because the recombinant RERG fusion protein was found to contain a contaminating phosphatase activity, unlabeled UTP (2 mm) was added to each reaction as described. GTP hydrolysis assays were performed in buffer containing 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 2 μg of RERG or RERGQ64L, 10 μm [α-32P]GTP (0.18 Ci/mmol), and either 4 mm UTP or 2 mm UTP and 2 mm GTP. Reactions were incubated at 22 °C for 1 min after which the Mg2+ concentration was adjusted to 10 mm. The reactions were then incubated at 37 °C for the indicated times, and 1-μl aliquots were removed and analyzed as described. The data were quantified using a STORM 850 PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). The percentage of GTP hydrolysis was calculated by dividing the amount of radioactivity in the GDP region by that of the sum of the GTP and GDP regions. Total cell lysates were prepared by first growing cells to 80% confluence on 100-mm plates. Next, the cells were washed one time with 1× phosphate-buffered saline and incubated on ice with 1 ml of radioimmune precipitation buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, and 50 mmTris, pH 7.5) for 30 min with occasional shaking. Cells were then spun for 10 min at 10,000 × g, and the protein concentration of the lysate was determined by the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). 40 μg of cell lysate was resolved on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and Ha-RERG expression was analyzed by Western blotting using the anti-HA.11 monoclonal antibody (Berkeley Antibody Co). Nuclei of MCF-7-pCDNA3 and MCF-7-Ha-RERG clones 2B6, 1C2, and 1C4 were isolated from cultures of 80% confluency cells, trypsinized, washed once with phosphate-buffered saline, and incubated in a 10× pellet volume of prechilled RSB (10 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) on ice for 10 min. Cells were then Dounce-homogenized on ice. Next, an aliquot of the cell suspension was examined under a phase contrast microscope for free nuclei. When greater than 90% of the cell suspension was free nuclei, it was centrifuged at 1000 ×g for 3 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was taken as the cytosolic fraction, and the pelleted nuclei were resuspended in 10 volumes of RSB. The nuclei were centrifuged and next resuspended in 10 volumes of RSB. Equal fractions of the nuclear fraction and cytosolic fraction were loaded onto a 12% SDS-PAGE gel, and Western analysis was performed. NIH 3T3, MCF-7, or MDA-MB-231 cells were transiently transfected with 1 μg of pEGFP or pEGFP-RERG using the LipofectAMINE PLUS Reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) in serum-free medium according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Three hours post-transfection, cells were then switched to growth medium, and 20 h post-transfection, cells were viewed in a Zeiss Axiophot fluorescence microscope (63× Plan-APOCHROMAT objective) equipped with a cooled charge-coupled device (CCD) camera, and digitized images were captured using MetaMorphTM 4.1.4 digital imaging software (Universal Imaging Corp.). GFP expression was detected from 20 μg of cell lysate by immunoblotting with anti-GFP monoclonal antibody (CLONTECH) followed by anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody and visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (Pierce). Growth curves were generated for MCF-7 cells expressing wild type RERG protein or vector controls as described (20Clark G.J. Cox A.D. Graham S.M. Der C.J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 255: 395-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). In brief, stable transfectants were seeded at 2 × 104cells/well in 6-well plates, then trypsinized and counted in triplicate at the indicated times after seeding. Soft agar growth analyses were performed as described previously (20Clark G.J. Cox A.D. Graham S.M. Der C.J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 255: 395-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Briefly, 104 MCF-7 cells stably expressing empty vector (control) or RERG overexpressing clones 1C4, 1C2, or 2B6 were seeded in duplicate into 0.3% Bacto-agar (Difco) over a 0.6% agar bottom layer, with colonies quantitated after ∼20 days. Tumorigenicity analyses were performed as described previously (20Clark G.J. Cox A.D. Graham S.M. Der C.J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 255: 395-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), except that 0.72 mg/60-day-time-release 17-β-estradiol pellets (Innovative Research of America) were implanted subcutaneously ∼24 h before the injection of cells. MCF-7 cells stably expressing empty vector or RERG medium or high expressing clones (1C4 and 2B6, respectively) were injected subcutaneously into 6–8 week athymic nude (BALB/c nu/nu) female mice at 106 cells/site at two sites per animal (dorsal flanks). Tumor formation was monitored at least twice a week and measured using calipers over the skin of the animal from 9–70 days post-injection. To further investigate the complex variations in gene expression patterns seen within primary human breast tumors, a new analytical method called statistical analysis of microarrays (SAM) (21Tusher V. Tibshirani R. Chu G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5116-5121Crossref PubMed Scopus (9648) Google Scholar) was used to analyze microarray data obtained from 78 different human breast tumors (2Sørlie T. Perou C.M. Tibshirani R. Aas T. Geisler S. Johnsen H. Eisen M.B. van de Rijn M. Jeffrey S.S. Quist H. Matese J.C. Brown P.O. Botstein D. Lønning P.E. Børresen-Dale A.-L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 19: 10869-10874Crossref Scopus (8330) Google Scholar). This analysis resulted in the identification of 264 genes whose expression correlated with overall patient survival (see Sørlie et al. (2Sørlie T. Perou C.M. Tibshirani R. Aas T. Geisler S. Johnsen H. Eisen M.B. van de Rijn M. Jeffrey S.S. Quist H. Matese J.C. Brown P.O. Botstein D. Lønning P.E. Børresen-Dale A.-L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 19: 10869-10874Crossref Scopus (8330) Google Scholar), Fig. 7 at genome-www.stanford.edu/breast_cancer/mopo_clinical for the complete 264 clone survival associated cluster diagram). Of particular interest were genes in which high expression was associated with favorable patient outcomes and the longest relapse free survival times. A single cluster of genes, which we refer to as the “luminal epithelial/ER+” cluster, contained most of the genes whose high expression was associated with long survival times (2Sørlie T. Perou C.M. Tibshirani R. Aas T. Geisler S. Johnsen H. Eisen M.B. van de Rijn M. Jeffrey S.S. Quist H. Matese J.C. Brown P.O. Botstein D. Lønning P.E. Børresen-Dale A.-L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 19: 10869-10874Crossref Scopus (8330) Google Scholar); included within this set of genes was the ER, a known estrogen-regulated gene (LIV-1), and a novel Ras-like GTPase that we call RERG forr as-related andestrogen-regulated growth-inhibitor (Fig. 1 A). The mRNA expression pattern of RERG across these 78 breast tumors was a statistically significant predictor of patient outcome in a univariate analysis (p = 0.0037); however, as would be expected by its expression pattern, it was not an independent predictor of outcome in a multivariate analysis because of its correlation with ER expression (p = 0.0001). The expression pattern of RERG was further investigated in a series of breast-derived cell lines. Northern blot analysis detected RERG mRNA in all of the estrogen receptor-positive breast-derived cell lines (MCF-7, MCF-10A, BT474, and T47D) but not in any of the ER-negative cell lines examined (SKBR3, MDA-MB-231, Hs578T, and BT-549 cells) (Fig. 1 B). The RERG gene is encoded by an ∼2.6-kilobase mRNA that contains a single open reading frame of 600 nucleotides (GenBankTM accession number AF339750). The putative 5′ untranslated region includes an in-frame stop codon 87 nucleotides 5′ to the putative translation start site, and the sequence surrounding the first ATG fits the consensus sequence for an efficient translation start site (22Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 857-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (2376) Google Scholar). The tissue distribution of RERG mRNA expression was determined by Northern blot analysis and screening of dbEST; a 2.6-kilobase transcript was detected in all 8 tissues examined (heart, brain, placenta, lung, liver, skin, kidney, and pancreas), with the highest levels of expression in heart, kidney, and pancreas (data not shown). A potentially ubiquitous pattern of expression is supported by Unigene/dbEST expression data (Hs.21594/hypothetical protein MGC15754/accession Number BC007997), which indicates that RERG is found in brain, kidney, muscle, prostate, uterus, adrenal gland, aorta, eye, lung, placenta, stomach, and testis. The RERG gene is located at 12p12, is contained within two overlapping bacterial artificial chromosome clones (AC007543 and AA022334), and is composed of four exons, the first two of which are separated by a 95-kilobase intron. Analysis of the RERG gene genomic sequence identified two potential consensus ER binding sites within the 5′ upstream region (data not shown). The location of RERG within a gene expression cluster that includes the ER, the high expression of RERG in ER-positive breast cell lines, and the presence of two potential ER binding sites within the promoter region suggested that RERG might be an estrogen-responsive gene. To evaluate this possibility, we used cDNA microarray analysis and examined RERG expression in response to β-estradiol stimulation in the estrogen-responsive MCF-7 cell line (see www4.stanford.edu/MicroArray/SMD for all microarray primary data files). MCF-7 cells grown in estrogen-free media for 2 days were supplemented with β-estradiol (1 × 10−8m) for 4, 8, or 24 h before harvesting mRNA and were compared with 48-h estrogen-deprived MCF-7 cultures. As seen in Fig. 1 C,RERG was rapidly expressed in response to β-estradiol treatment (1.9-fold stimulation after 4 h and 3-fold after 24 h), suggesting that it is a direct target of activated ER. Tamoxifen, an ER antagonist in the breast, acts as an inhibitor of estrogen-induced responses including the regulation of ER-responsive genes. Thus, the effect of tamoxifen (6 μm) in the presence of estrogen was examined on global gene expression patterns. As expected for an ER-regulated gene, RERG expression was completely repressed by tamoxifen and induced by estrogen although not as dramatically as other known estrogen-regulated genes (see cathepsin D and protein kinase H11 for examples of how known ER-responsive genes behaved in these experiments) (Fig. 1 C). The predicted amino acid sequence of the RERG protein is encoded by an open reading frame of 600 base pairs that codes for a 199-amino acid protein that is 50 and 47% identical to the Dictyostelium Ras-D and Ras-S proteins respectively, and 44 to 45% identical to human Rit, TC21/R-Ras-2, M-Ras/R-Ras-3, Rin, and Rap1b (Fig. 2). Although RERG shares significant sequence identity and organization with Ras, it also contains a number of unique features. First, RERG has an alanine at the position corresponding to the glycine at position 12 of Ki-Ras. Substitution of this residue with alanine results in the constitutive activation of Ras (23Barbacid M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 779-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (3748) Google Scholar). Another unique feature of RERG is that it lacks any known COOH-terminal prenylation motif, indicating that it is not subject to post-translational prenylation (24Casey P.J. Seabra M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5289-5292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar, 25Glomset J.A. Farnsworth C.C. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 181-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Prenylation facilitates the association of Ras with the plasma membrane, and nonprenylated mutants of Ras are rendered completely inactive. Instead, stretches of basic residues are found in the RERG COOH-terminal region. These unique COOH-terminal features of RERG are similar to those of Rit and Rin (11Wes P.D., Yu, M. Montell C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5839-5848Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 12Lee C.H. Della N.G. Chew C.E. Zack D.J. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 6784-6794Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Shao H. Kadono-Okuda K. Finlin B.S. Andres D.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 371: 207-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The GTP binding activity of recombinant RERG was assayed using [35S]GTPγS, and bound GTP was separated by rapid filtration. As seen in Fig. 3 A, native recombinant RERG but not heat-inactivated RERG binds GTPγS rapidly in a Mg2+-dependent manner upon incubation under standard nucleotide exchange conditions. As observed with other GTPases, the association of guanine nucleotides with RERG was greatly effected by the concentration of magnesium ions. Replacement of MgCl2 in the reaction with EDTA completely abolished GTPγS binding (data not shown). The binding of both GDP and GTP"

Here, for the first time, we report that it induces apoptosis in the human neuroblastoma cell line SH-SY5Y. The earliest detectable apoptotic event in this system is the rapid depolarization of mitochondrial membranes, occurring immediately upon treatment of cells with PrP-(106–126). Subsequent to this, cytochrome c release and caspase activation were observed. Caspase inhibitors demonstrated that while the peptide activates caspases they are not an absolute requirement for apoptosis. Parallel to caspase activation, PrP-(106–126) was also observed to trigger a rise in intracellular calcium through release of mitochondrial calcium stores. This leads to the activation of calpains, another family of proteases. A calpain inhibitor demonstrated that while calpains are activated by the peptide they also are not an absolute requirement for apoptosis. Interestingly a combination of caspase and calpain inhibitors significantly inhibited apoptosis. This illustrates alternative pathways leading to apoptosis via caspases and calpains and that blocking both pathways is required to inhibit apoptosis. These results implicate the mitochondrion as a primary site of action of PrP-(106–126). The synthetic peptide PrP-(106–126) has previously been shown to be neurotoxic.

They are characterized by vacuolation of the neuropil, neuronal loss, and gliosis (1Masters C.L. Richardson Jr., E.P. Brain. 1978; 101: 333-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). In many cases this is also accompanied by the extracellular accumulation of the scrapie isoform (PrPSC)1 of the normal cellular prion protein (PrPC), which can aggregate into fibrils in the extracellular matrix (2Mikol J. Biomed. Pharmacother. 1999; 53: 19-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). PrPSC is widely believed to be the infectious agent of these diseases (3Prusiner S.B. Science. 1991; 252: 1515-1522Crossref PubMed Scopus (1749) Google Scholar), and the formation of PrPSC is thought to be via a post-translational conformational change by which PrPC complexes with PrPSC to yield two molecules of PrPSC (4Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13363-13383Crossref PubMed Scopus (5167) Google Scholar). PrPC is a cell surface protein mainly expressed in the neuronal and glial cells of the central nervous system. The exact function of PrPC remains unknown, although recent studies have implicated it in copper metabolism (5Pauly P.C. Harris D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33107-33110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar, 6Ruiz F.H. Silva E. Inestrosa N.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Apoptosis is a physiologically important cellular suicide pathway, which has also been implicated in a number of pathological conditions (9Gorman A.M. McGowan A. O'Neill C. Cotter T. J. Neurol. Sci. 1996; 139: 45-52Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). There is some evidence to indicate that the mechanism of neuronal cell death in prion diseases is apoptosis as apoptotic neurons have been observed in the brain of scrapie-infected sheep (10Fairbairn D.W.

A synthetic peptide corresponding to residues 106–126 of human PrP (PrP-(106–126)) has previously been found to induce apoptosis in primary rat hippocampal cultures (13Forloni G. Angeretti N. Chiesa R. Monzani E. Salmona M. Bugiani O. Tagliavini F. Nature. 1993; 362: 543-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar), primary mouse cerebellar cultures (14Brown D.R. Schmidt B.

Chabry J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36487-36490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). PrP-(106–126) is one of a number of peptides corresponding to sequences within fragments of amyloid proteins isolated from the brains of patients suffering from Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker syndrome (17Tagliavini F. Prelli F. Ghiso J. Bugiani O. Serban D. Prusiner S.B. Farlow M.R. Ghetti B. Frangione B. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 513-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). It retains the ability of PrPSC to aggregate into amyloid-like fibrils and the tendency to adopt a mostly β-sheet structure (18Tagliavini F. Prelli F. Verga L. Giaccone G. Sarma R. Gorevic P. Ghetti B. Passerini F. Ghibaudi E. Forloni G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9678-9682Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Residues 106–126 of PrP constitute a region maintained in all the PrP isoforms that have been found to accumulate in the brains of patients suffering from prion diseases. Under normal physiological conditions a catabolic pathway also leads to cleavage of this region of the prion protein at residues 110 and 111 (19Chen S.G. Teplow D.B. Parchi P. Teller J.K. Gambetti P. Autilio-Gambetti L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19173-19180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). The importance of the 106–126 sequence of the prion protein makes it a useful model for the in vitro study of prion-induced cell death. In this study we determine, for the first time, the effect of PrP-(106–126) in human neuroblastoma cells in vitro and demonstrate its ability to induce apoptosis. Furthermore, we establish the mitochondrion as a target of PrP-(106–126) action and show that the peptide activates two distinct biochemical pathways involving caspases and calpains, which both result in apoptosis. PrP-(106–126) (KTNMKHMAGAAAAGAVVGGLG) and PrP-(106–126) scrambled (scr) (AVHTGLGAMAALNMVVGGAAGL) were synthesized and purified by MWG Biotech (Milton Keynes, UK). Peptides were dissolved in sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) to a concentration of 1 mm before use and were freshly prepared before each experiment. The inhibitors z-VAD-fmk (Enzymes Systems Products, Livermore, CA) and calpeptin (Sigma) were added to cells 15 min prior to drug/peptide treatments. The degree of peptide aggregation was measured fluorimetrically by thioflavin-T binding (20Baumann M.H. Kallijarvi J. Lankinen H. Soto C. Haltia M. Biochem. J. 2000; 349: 77-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Aged preparations of peptides in PBS were added to 50 mmglycine, pH 9, with 2 μm thioflavin-T (Sigma) to a concentration of 100 μm. Samples were incubated at room temperature for 5 min, and then fluorescence was measured on a Spectramax Gemini fluorometer with excitation and emission maxima of 435 and 485 nm, respectively. Samples were prepared in triplicate. The adherent human neuroblastoma cell line SH-SY5Y was cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.), 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.), and 1% l-glutamine (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cells were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2atmosphere. For experiments, cells were maintained in serum-free RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 1% Growth Medium Supplement-A (Life Technologies, Inc.), 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and 1%l-glutamine. When being passaged or harvested for analysis cells were lifted using trypsin/EDTA. Cytotoxicity was assessed by the conversion of MTT (Sigma) to a formazan product. After appropriate incubation of cells with peptides, MTT was added to each well to a final concentration of 0.25 mg/ml and then incubated for 4 h at 37 °C. Microtiter plates were then centrifuged at 200 ×g for 5 min. The reaction was terminated by removal of the supernatant and addition of 100 μl of Me2SO to each well. Following thorough mixing to dissolve the formazan product, the plates were read at 620 nm on a microELISA plate reader. Assays were performed in replicate of four samples. Cell viability was assessed by flow cytometry that monitored annexin V binding and propidium iodide (PI) uptake simultaneously. After appropriate incubation with drugs/peptides, cells were resuspended in annexin V binding buffer and then treated with annexin V (1×) and PI (5 μg/ml) for 5 min at room temperature. Samples were then analyzed by fluorescence on a FACScan flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson, Oxford, UK). Fluorescence was measured through a 530/30 band pass filter (FL-1) to monitor annexin V binding and through a 585/42 band pass filter (FL-2) to monitor PI uptake. An initial increase in FL-1 fluorescence is indicative of apoptosis before an increase in FL-2, indicative of secondary necrosis, is observed. DNA was isolated and electrophoresed on 10% agarose gels by the method of McGahon et al. (21McGahon A.J. Martin S.J. Bissonnette R.P. Mahboudi A. Shi Y. Mogil R.J. Nishioka W.K. Green D.R. Methods Cell Biol. 1995; 46: 153-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). Cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mmNa3VO4, 1 mm NaF, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μl of protein inhibitor mixture (1 μg/ml antipain, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml chymostatin, 0.1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin)) and put on ice for 40 min. Samples were then centrifuged at 20,800 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was then transferred into Eppendorf tubes, and protein concentrations were determined using a Bio-Rad protein assay reagent. Protein was separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (15% gel, 30 μg of protein/sample) and then transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Proteins were detected using appropriate antibodies and the ECL detection reagent (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The antibodies used were mouse monoclonal anti-human Bcl-2 (DAKO, Cambridge, UK), rabbit monoclonal anti-Bcl-XL, (Calbiochem), rabbit monoclonal anti-Bax (DAKO, Cambridge, UK), monoclonal anti-cytochrome c(DAKO), and monoclonal anti-cytochrome c oxidase (DAKO). Cells were harvested and treated with 10 μmJC-1 (Molecular Probes, Leiden, Netherlands) for 15 min at 37 °C (22Salvioli S. Ardizzoni A. Franceschi C. Cossarizza A.

Fluorescence emission was collected through FL-1 on a log scale. FL-1 measures the fluorescence of JC-1 monomers, which increase in number as the mitochondrial membrane depolarizes. Cells were washed in 2 ml of PBS, fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde on ice for 30 min, and then washed in 1 ml of IFA-Tx (4% fetal calf serum, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 0.1% sodium azide, 0.1% Triton X-100, 150 mmsaline). Samples were then resuspended in 150 μl of IFA-Tx containing primary antibody (rabbit polyclonal anti-active caspase-3, 1:600 dilution (Pharmingen, San Diego, CA)), put on ice for 1 h, centrifuged at 200 × g, and washed twice in 1 ml of IFA-Tx. IFA-Tx was aspirated off, and to the remaining drop in each sample, 2 μl of secondary antibody (fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled anti-rabbit (Sigma)) was added. Samples were left for 1 h on ice in darkness and then washed twice in 1 ml of IFA-Tx. Samples were then resuspended in 0.5 ml of PBS, and fluorescence was measured on a FACScan flow cytometer through FL-1. An increase in FL-1 fluorescence above the control is indicative of caspase activity. Samples treated with an irrelevant antibody (rabbit IgG (Sigma)) and with secondary antibody only were used as controls. Cells were washed once in PBS and then resuspended and lysed in 40 μl of 10 mm HEPES, 50 mm NaCl on ice for 40 min. After lysis the samples were centrifuged at 1000 × g for 5 min to pellet the membrane fraction. The supernatant (cytosolic fraction) was transferred to a clean Eppendorf tube, and the membrane fraction was resuspended in 40 μl of 10 mm HEPES, 50 mm NaCl. A protein determination assay was performed on both fractions, and an equal amount of protein was loaded into each well of a 96-well plate (ideally 100 μg of protein/well). To each well, 32 μl of fluorescent substrate (Suc-Leu-Tyr (AFL-117) (Enzyme Systems Products)) was added, and the total volume of each well was brought to 200 μl with imidazole buffer (100 mm imidazole, 5 mml-cysteine, 1 mm mercaptoethanol, 10 mm CaCl2, 4% Me2SO in H2O). Samples were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min after the addition of the substrate. Fluorescence was then measured on a fluorometer (Spectra Max Gemini, Molecular Devices) with excitation and emission wavelengths of 400 and 505 nm, respectively. Cells were washed once in PBS and then resuspended in 650 μl of PBS. Next 3.25 μl of 10 mmmonochlorobimane (Molecular Probes) was added to each sample. Samples were measured in triplicate, so 200 μl of each sample was aliquoted into three wells of a dark 96-well plate. Samples were incubated at room temperature for 15 min in darkness and then read on a fluorometer (Spectra Max Gemini, Molecular Devices) with excitation and emission maxima of 395 and 482 nm, respectively. The activity of catalase was measured by following the decrease in absorbance at 240 nm due to H2O2 decomposition (23Aebi H. Methods in Enzymology. 105. Academic Press, Inc., Orlando, FL1984: 121-126Google Scholar). Activity was measured as rate of change of absorbance (ΔO.D./min). Changes in intracellular calcium concentration were detected by loading cells with FLUO-3 (1×) (Molecular Probes) for 15 min prior to sample collection and measurement of fluorescence on a FACScan flow cytometer. Fluorescence emission was collected through FL-1 on a log scale, and an increase in FL-1 fluorescence is indicative of an increase in calcium levels. Cells were harvested, washed in 1 ml of homogenizing medium (1 msucrose, 1 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 50 mm EGTA, and 1% bovine serum albumin), resuspended in 80 μl of homogenizing medium, and Dounce-homogenized. Samples were centrifuged at 1000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was transferred to a clean Eppendorf tube. The supernatant was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The pellet was then washed in 100 μl of Wash 1 (1 m sucrose, 1m Tris-HCl, 1% bovine serum albumin (pH 7.4), 50 mm EGTA, and 1 m KCl), centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, and washed in 100 μl of Wash 2 (1 m mannitol, 1 m KCl, 1m Tris-HCl, 1% bovine serum albumin (pH 7.4)). Finally the sample was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C and resuspended in RIPA buffer (see “Western Blotting”). Cytochrome c was visualized by Western blot analysis using anti-cytochrome c (Pharmingen). The supernatant was retained as the cytosolic fraction. PrP-(106–126) has previously been reported to induce cell death as a result of its ability to form aggregates (13Forloni G. Angeretti N. Chiesa R. Monzani E. Salmona M. Bugiani O. Tagliavini F. Nature. 1993; 362: 543-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar, 24Hope J. Shearman M.S. Baxter H.C. Chong A. Kelly S.M. Price N.C. Neurodegeneration. 1996; 5: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The aggregation status of the peptide in this study was ascertained by means of a thioflavin-T assay (Fig.1 A). Thioflavin-T fluorescence increases in the presence of protein aggregates. PrP-(106–126) was seen to aggregate immediately at day 0 when prepared at 100 μm in PBS, and over time it gradually increases its aggregation status. The scrambled version of the peptide shows little aggregation even over time. PrP-(106–126) was observed to induce cell death in a dose-dependent manner over time as measured by MTT assay (Fig. 1 B). MTT is converted to a formazan product by mitochondrial enzymes, which become inactive as the cell dies. Measurement of this formazan product is an indicator of cell viability. The mechanism of cell death induced by PrP-(106–126) was shown to be apoptosis by annexin V binding (Fig. 1 C). Annexin V binds to phosphatidylserine, which flips from the inner to the outer leaflet of the cell membrane during apoptosis (73Martin S.J. Reutelingsperger C.P. McGahon A.J. Rader J.A. van Schie R.C. LaFace D.M. Green D.R. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 1545-1556Crossref PubMed Scopus (2570) Google Scholar). Apoptosis could be detected as early as 2 h after treatment when 22% of the cell population were annexin-positive. Cells were incubated with annexin V and PI simultaneously The population of cells in the lower left quadrant represents viable cells (Fig. 1 C). An increase in FL-1 represents annexin V-positive cells in the lower right quadrant. This is the apoptotic population. The final shift in FL-2 up to the top right quadrant represents PI-positive cells, indicative of membrane permeability and secondary necrosis. The percentage of the overall population in each quadrant is given in the circles. The mechanism of cell death was further confirmed to be via apoptosis by the observation of DNA ladder patterns upon electrophoresis of isolated DNA from peptide treated cells (Fig.1 D). The internucleosomal cleavage of DNA into ∼200-base pair fragments is a typical biochemical hallmark of apoptosis in a number of systems (74McKenna S.L. Carmody R.J. Cotter T.G. Cell Engineering. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1999Google Scholar). No effects were observed upon treatment with PrP-(106–126)scr. A number of typical apoptotic events are observed to occur after treatment of cells with 100 μmPrP-(106–126). Mitochondrial dysfunction characterized by a loss of transmembrane potential has been found to be a central event in many cases of apoptosis (25Carmody R.J. Cotter T.G. Sepsis. 1998; 2: 9-19Crossref Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Analysis of Ψm using the lipophilic fluorescent probe JC-1 demonstrates extensive loss of Ψm (represented by an increase in fluorescence of FL-1 due to increased numbers of JC-1 monomers) within 15 min of treatment with 100 μmPrP-(106–126) (Fig. 2 A). PrP-(106–126)scr (100 μm) had no significant effect. Although the response is maximal at 15 min, mitochondrial membrane depolarization is observed to commence immediately upon treatment of the cells with PrP-(106–126) when fluorescence in FL-1 is measured as a function of time on the FACScan flow cytometer (Fig. 2 B). Also within this 15-min time frame, cytochrome c is released from the mitochondria into the cytosol (Fig. 2 C), and caspase-3 activity is easily detectable by measuring the fluorescence of an anti-active caspase-3 antibody on a flow cytometer (Fig.2 D). Cytochrome cis a protein of the mitochondrial intermembrane space that is commonly released during apoptosis following membrane depolarization, which leads to caspase activation. The caspases are a family of serine threonine proteases responsible for the cleavage of a number of substrates during apoptosis (42Perkins C.L. Fang G. Kim C.N. Bhalla K.N. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 1645-1653PubMed Google Scholar). Despite these early apoptotic events, at 15 min apoptosis is not detectable by annexin binding. In view of the rapid effects of PrP-(106–126) on the mitochondria we investigated possible effects on the Bcl-2 family of proteins. These are important regulators of apoptosis, composed of both pro- and antiapoptotic members, and are known to operate at the level of the mitochondrion (26Bruce-Keller A.J. Begley J.G. Fu W.

We examined the intracellular levels of Bcl-2, an antiapoptotic protein, when cells were treated with 100 μm PrP-(106–126) (Fig. 3 A). After a 15-min treatment with 100 μm PrP-(106–126) there was a dramatic reduction of Bcl-2 protein as compared with the untreated control. PrP-(106–126)scr (100 μm) caused no change in the levels of Bcl-2. We also examined the effects of the peptide on other Bcl-2 family members, Bcl-XL(antiapoptotic) and Bax (proapoptotic) (Fig. 3 A). In contrast to what was observed with Bcl-2, we found no change in the intracellular levels of Bcl-XL or Bax in response to 100 μm PrP-(106–126). As a caspase cleavage site was previously reported to be present in Bcl-2 (29Kirsch D.G. Doseff A. Chau B.N. Lim D.S. de Souza-Pinto N.C. Hansford R. Kastan M.B. Lazebnik Y.A. Hardwick J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21155-21161Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar), the effect of z-VAD, a pan caspase inhibitor previously reported to block apoptosis, on Bcl-2 degradation was investigated (Fig. 3 B). The reduction of Bcl-2 induced by 100 μm PrP-(106–126) was found to be inhibited in cells that were pretreated with 100 or 200 μm z-VAD. Cells treated with 200 μm z-VAD or 100 μm PrP-(106–126)scr alone showed no change in their Bcl-2 levels. A concentration of 100 μm z-VAD was shown to block caspase-3 activity as measured by anti-active caspase-3 antibody on the FACScan flow cytometer (Fig. 3 C). Thus, the inhibition of caspases maintains the protein levels of the antiapoptotic Bcl-2 even in the presence of PrP-(106–126). The same treatment of cells with z-VAD did not inhibit mitochondrial depolarization (Fig. 3 D), placing this event upstream of caspase activation and Bcl-2 degradation. More importantly, z-VAD did not inhibit apoptosis despite blocking caspase-mediated Bcl-2 degradation, indicating that caspases are not necessary for PrP-(106–126) to induce cell death. With caspases found to be nonessential for apoptosis in this system, another mechanism must be at work. Maintaining focus on the mitochondrion, as this was the site of the earliest observed effect of PrP-(106–126), we investigated the possible role of oxidative stress due to disruption of mitochondrial function as this is the primary site of intracellular reactive oxygen species production. Oxidative stress has been shown to have a role in a number of apoptotic systems (30Verhaegen S. McGowan A.J. Brophy A.R. Fernandes R.S. Cotter T.G. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1995; 50: 1021-1029Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 31Slater A.F.G. Stefan C. Nobel I. van den Dobbelsteen D.J. Orrenius S. Cell Death Differ. 1996; 3: 57-62PubMed Google Scholar). We examined the intracellular levels of peroxides, superoxide anion, and nitric oxide as well as the activities of Mn-superoxide dismutase and Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase (data not shown). We also looked at glutathione levels using the fluorescent monochlorobimane probe (Fig.4 A) and the activity of catalase by following the decrease in absorbance at 240 nm due to H2O2 decomposition (Fig. 4 B) in response to PrP-(106–126). Glutathione not only acts as a reactive oxygen species scavenger but also functions in the regulation of the intracellular redox state, and catalase is the primary defense mechanism against H2O2. None of the aforementioned changed appreciably in response to PrP-(106–126). Staurosporine (0.25 μm) and valinomycin (50 nm) were used as positive controls as both these drugs induce oxidative stress in SH-SY5Y cells. The peptide was not found to predispose the cells to death by a secondary oxidative insult either (data not shown). Another function of the mitochondrion is in the regulation of intracellular calcium levels, therefore we investigated whether PrP-(106–126) could be exerting an effect through the deregulation of calcium homeostasis. Using the fluorescent probe FLUO-3 we demonstrated an intracellular rise in calcium levels (represented by an increase in FL-1 fluorescence) in response to PrP-(106–126) (Fig.5 A). The response is immediate, and calcium levels reach a sustained peak by 30 s. This experiment was repeated in the presence of EGTA, a calcium chelator, to show that the source of the calcium was intracellular (data not shown). BAPTA-AM, an intracellular calcium chelator, was found to inhibit this increase in calcium levels, confirming the intracellular nature of the source of the calcium rise (Fig. 5 B). The two major calcium stores in the cell are the endoplasmic reticulum and the mitochondria. To determine which was releasing calcium into the cytosol in this system we used thapsigargin, which causes a rapid release of endoplasmic reticulum calcium stores. Upon treatment of cells with thapsigargin, an increase in calcium levels was observed using the FLUO-3 probe. Once that response had reached its maximum, cells were treated with 100 μm PrP-(106–126), and a further increase in calcium was observed (Fig. 5 C). This indicates that PrP-(106–126) releases calcium from a site other than the endoplasmic reticulum. The mitochondria make up the only other store of calcium in the cell large enough to account for the PrP-(106–126)-induced rise in calcium levels. We next examined the activity of calpains in response to the PrP-(106–126)-induced rise in intracellular calcium. The calpains are a group of calcium-activated proteases that have also been implicated in apoptosis. They can exist in active and inactive forms associated with the cell membrane or the cytosol (32Ray S.K. Wilford G.G. Matzelle D.C. Hogan E.L. Banik N.L. Ann. N. Y. Acad.

Virol. 1999; 73: 695-701Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Within 15 min of treating cells with 100 μm PrP-(106–126) an increase in calpain activity was evident in both the cells in cytosolic and membrane fractions as measured using a fluorescent calpain substrate (Fig. 6 A). Pretreatment of cells with the calpain inhibitor calpeptin was found to inhibit the activity of the calpains induced by PrP-(106–126) but not cell death. However, when cells were pretreated with a combination of 100 μm z-VAD and 100 μm calpeptin, apoptosis induced by 100 μm PrP-(106–126) was significantly inhibited (Fig. 6 B). The toxicity of the PrP-(106–126) peptide in a human neuronal cell line has not been demonstrated previously. Host expression of PrPC has been illustrated to be a prerequisite of PrP-(106–126) toxicity (14Brown D.R. Schmidt B. Kretzschmar H.A. Nature. 1996; 380: 345-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). Accordingly we observed the presence of PrPC in the SH-SY5Y cell line upon Western blot analysis (data not shown).

In tissues with inflammation or infection, various cells in the host immune system are activated to produce various enzymes, including inducible nitric-oxide synthase, NAD(P)H oxidase, and myeloperoxidase, which generate reactive species such as nitric oxide, superoxide anion (O⨪2), and HOCl, respectively (3Ohshima H.

This study demonstrated that chlorination but not nitration occurred extensively in phagocytosed probes, whereas both nitration and chlorination were catalyzed by secreted myeloperoxidase under extracellular conditions.In the present study, we have found that various nucleosides react with HOCl to form chlorinated nucleosides, including the novel 8-chloroguanosine (8-Cl-Guo). To compare chlorination, oxidation, and nitration activities of HOCl in the presence or absence of nitrite, we carried out the reactions with guanosine and analyzed the products 8-Cl-Guo, 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanosine (8-oxo-Guo), and 8-nitro-Guo by HPLC. We found that chlorination is a major reaction mediated by HOCl, even in the presence of nitrite. Tertiary amines such as trimethylamine (TMA) and nicotine at physiologically relevant concentrations were found to enhance the chlorination dramatically. These catalytic effects of tertiary amines could be important in host defense as well as in various pathophysiological conditions associated with chronic inflammation, especially those caused by tobacco habits.DISCUSSIONWe have demonstrated that HOCl, human myeloperoxidase in the presence of H2O2 and Cl−, and activated human neutrophils in the presence of Cl− can react with various (2′-deoxy)nucleosides to form chlorinated (2′-deoxy)nucleosides.

Although the reaction of HOCl and nucleosides such as guanosine was reported in the 1970s to form unknown products (27Hayatsu H. Pan S. Ukita T. Chem. Pharm. Bull. (Tokyo). 1971; 19: 2189-2192Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), this study is the first to isolate the product and identify it as 8-Cl-(d)Guo. The yield of 8-Cl-Guo under our standard conditions (0.5 mm each of guanosine and HOCl, pH 7.4) was 1.6%, whereas about 30% of the guanosine disappeared during the reaction with HOCl. This suggests that the majority of the compounds were not detected by our HPLC-UV method. We are currently identifying other products formed by the reaction between (2′-deoxy)guanosine and HOCl.Recent studies show that nitrating and oxidizing agents such as NO2Cl, HO⋅, and singlet oxygen are formed from HOCl in the presence of nitrite, O⨪2, and metallic ions (EquationsEquation 1, Equation 2, Equation 3, Equation 4, Equation 5, Equation 6) (6Eiserich J.P.

For these reasons, we compared the relative chlorination, oxidation, and nitration activities of HOCl, myeloperoxidase, and activated neutrophils in the presence and the absence of nitrite by analyzing 8-Cl-, 8-oxo-, and 8-nitro-Guo, respectively, in the reactions with guanosine. We found that chlorination occurs more easily than oxidation or nitration in each reaction.Henderson et al. (4Henderson J.P. Byun J. Heinecke J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33440-33448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) recently reported that formation of 5-Cl-dCyd is enhanced by the presence of Cl− under acidic conditions but not under neutral conditions. On the basis of these findings, they proposed that a Cl2-like species, formed by the reaction of HOCl with Cl− and H+ (Equation1), is the chlorinating intermediate in 5-Cl-dCyd formation. In our experiments, 8-Cl-Guo formation by HOCl was similarly enhanced by the presence of Cl− under acidic conditions, suggesting that a Cl2-like species is involved in the reaction. On the other hand, the yield of 5-Cl-dCyd even in the presence of Cl−is low at neutral pH, compared with that under acidic conditions (4Henderson J.P. Byun J. Heinecke J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33440-33448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), whereas the yield of 8-Cl-Guo at pH > 7.4 is high even in the absence of Cl−. Higher yields of 8-Cl-Guo are formed under more alkaline conditions (pH > 8) (Fig. 4A). These results suggest that 8-Cl-Guo formation at neutral pH is mediated by a chlorinating intermediate that may be different from a Cl2-like species. On the basis of these findings and other published data, we propose a mechanism for the formation of 8-Cl- and 8-oxo-Guo by the reaction of guanosine with HOCl under neutral conditions (Fig. 15). In the reaction of HOCl, the Cl+ moiety (HOδ−Clδ+) has been proposed to serve as an electrophilic species (28Arnhold J. Panasenko O.M. Schiller J. Vladimirov Y. Arnold K. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1995; 78: 55-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 29Brezonik P.L. Chemical Kinetics and Process Dynamics in Aquatic Systems. Lewis Publishers, London1994Google Scholar). Like various electrophilic carcinogens that react at N-7 of guanine, the most nucleophilic position, to form N-7 adducts, Cl+ could react first with N-7 of guanine to form an N-7 chlorine adduct cation as an intermediate, which might then be converted to 8-Cl-Guo by a chlorine migration (Fig. 15). Another strong electrophile, a nitrenium ion (R− NH+) arising from hydroxylamine, has been reported to react with 2′-deoxyguanosine to form an adduct at C-8 along with several other products including 8-oxo-dGuo (30Humphreys W.G. Kadlubar F.F. Guengerich F.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8278-8282Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 31Guengerich F.P. Mundkowski R.G. Voehler M. Kadlubar F.F. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1999; 12: 906-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). These studies also suggested that an N-7 adduct cation is first formed as an intermediate by the reaction of dGuo with R−NH+, followed by arylamine migration from N-7 to C-8 to form the C-8 arylamine adduct (30Humphreys W.G. Kadlubar F.F. Guengerich F.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8278-8282Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 31Guengerich F.P. Mundkowski R.G. Voehler M. Kadlubar F.F. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1999; 12: 906-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Higher yields of 8-Cl-Guo under alkaline conditions (Fig.4A) could be attributable to deprotonation of H-8 from the N-7 chlorine adduct cation by OH− that would facilitate the migration of the chlorine atom from N-7 to C-8 (Fig. 15).In the present study, 8-oxo-Guo was also formed easily in the reaction of guanosine with HOCl under neutral conditions. The lack of effects of addition of dimethyl sulfoxide, a scavenger of HO⋅ (Fig. 8), and of D2O, an enhancer of 1O2*, upon the yield of 8-oxo-Guo (data not shown) rules out the possibility of involvement of HO⋅ and 1O2*. Thermodynamic calculations indicate that HOCl can act as either a one- or a two-electron oxidant (32Koppenol W.H. FEBS Lett. 1994; 347: 5-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). However, it is a relatively poor one-electron oxidant, having an estimated one-electron reduction potential (E°′) in the range of +0.17 to +0.26 V at pH 7 (32Koppenol W.H. FEBS Lett. 1994; 347: 5-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) and therefore would not oxidize guanosine in neutral solution, because the one-electron oxidation potential of guanosine is +1.29 V at pH 7 (33Steenken S. Jovanovik S.V. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 617-618Crossref Scopus (1264) Google Scholar). On the other hand, HOCl is a strong two-electron oxidant, having an E°′ of +1.08 V, and might oxidize guanosine, resulting in guanosine+ via a two-electron oxidation. However, it has been reported that 8-oxo-dGuo is not formed from 2′-deoxyguanosine by another two-electron oxidant, an artificial nuclease Mn-TMPyP/KHSO5 (34Viala C. Praviel G. Claparols C. Meunier B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 11548-11553Crossref Scopus (92) Google Scholar). On the basis of these biophysical data, we propose that 8-oxo-(d)Guo formation by HOCl is not mediated by a two-electron oxidation reaction but can be mediated through formation of an N-7 chlorine adduct cation from guanosine and Cl+ and a further reaction with H2O (Fig. 15). Interpretation of analyses of 8-oxo-Guo formed by the human myeloperoxidase system and activated neutrophils is complicated because 8-oxo-Guo, once formed, can be also easily converted to further oxidation products by oxidants (35Niles J.C. Burney S. Singh S.P. Wishnok J.S. Tannenbaum S.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11729-11734Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). We have recently identified diastereomers of spiroiminodihydantoin nucleoside as an oxidized product formed by reaction of 8-oxo-dGuo with HOCl or with a myeloperoxidase-H2O2-Cl− system (36Suzuki T. Masuda M. Friesen M.D. Ohshima H. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2001; 14: 1163-1169Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar).The presence of physiologically relevant concentrations (µm) of tertiary amines such as nicotine and TMA dramatically enhanced chlorination of free (2′-deoxy)nucleosides and those in RNA but not in DNA by HOCl. Oxidation and nitration of guanosine by HOCl were also enhanced by tertiary amines. Interestingly, the presence of nicotine completely inhibited the formation ofN-chlorinated 2′-deoxycytidine by HOCl, suggesting that nicotine reacted more rapidly with HOCl than the primary amino group of 2′-deoxycytidine. Prütz (26Prutz W.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 357: 265-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) recently reported that chlorination of salicylate is enhanced by several orders of magnitude by catalytic amounts of tertiary amines such as TMA and quinuclidine. It has been reported that tertiary amines react with HOCl to form reactive quaternary chlorammonium ions (R3N+−Cl) (Equation 7) that readily chlorinate secondary amines to formN-chloro secondary amines (Equation 8) (37Ellis, A. J., and Soper, F. G. (1954) J. Chem. Soc. 1750–1755.Google Scholar, 38Higuchi, T., Hussain, A., and Pltman, I. H. (1969) J. Chem. Soc. 626–631.Google Scholar). HOCl+R3N→R3N+−Cl+OH−Equation 7 R3N+−Cl+R2′NH→R3N+−H+R2′N−ClEquation 8 R3N+−Cl→R3N⋅++Cl⋅Equation 9 It is therefore possible that the quaternary chlorammonium ions may chlorinate (2′-deoxy)guanosine at the N-7 position to form first its N-7 chlorine adduct via a Cl+-like species or direct transfer of chlorine atom, followed by migration of chlorine to generate 8-Cl-Guo (Fig. 15).An alternative mechanism for chlorination of nucleosides involves free radicals. The quaternary chlorammonium ion may generate a chlorine radical (Cl⋅) together with a tertiary amine cation radical (Equation 9), as suggested for the myeloperoxidase-catalyzed oxidation of aminopyrine (39Sayo H. Saito M. Xenobiotica. 1990; 20: 957-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Cl⋅ could then react with guanosine to form a C-8 guanosine radical that might react further with Cl⋅, HO⋅, and NO⋅2 to form 8-Cl-, 8-oxo-, and 8-nitro-Guo, respectively. However, the fact that metallic ions enhanced oxidation but not chlorination (Table I) suggests that involvement of free radicals in chlorination is less likely.The presence of physiologically relevant concentrations (µm) of nicotine and TMA dramatically enhanced the chlorination damage of (2′-deoxy)nucleosides not only by HOCl but also by human myeloperoxidase and activated neutrophils. Because the nicotine content of mainstream smoke from commercial cigarettes ranges from <0.3 to 2.5 mg/cigarette (40IARC Working Group on the Evaluation of Carcinogenic Risks to Humans IARC Monographs on the Evaluation of the Carcinogenic Risk of Chemicals to Humans: Tobacco Smoking. 38. International Agency for Research on Cancer, Lyon, France1986Google Scholar), its concentration in the respiratory tract could easily reach the µm range. Cigarette smoking is a major risk factor for a number of diseases, including lung cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, arteriosclerosis, cardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, and Crohn's disease. Inflammation is common to the pathogenesis of these diseases. It has been reported that nicotine is chemotactic for neutrophils (41Totti N. McCusker K.T. Campbell E.J. Griffin G.L. Senior R.M. Science. 1984; 223: 169-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) and cigarette smoke primes neutrophils (42Koethe S.M. Kuhnmuench J.R. Becker C.G. Am. J. Pathol. 2000; 157: 1735-1743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The present study suggests that nicotine present in tobacco smoke may further enhance tissue and DNA damage through HOCl-mediated chlorination by myeloperoxidase secreted from neutrophils, contributing to lung carcinogenesis and other smoking-related diseases. It is interesting to note that the G−463A polymorphism of the MPOgene, which strongly reduces myeloperoxidase mRNA expression (43Piedrafita F.J. Molander R.B. Vansant G. Orlova E.A. Pfahl M. Reynolds W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14412-14420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar), is associated with a reduced risk of lung cancer (44London S.J. Lehman T.A. Taylor J.A. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 5001-5003PubMed Google Scholar, 45Cascorbi I. Henning S. Brockmoller J. Gephart J. Meisel C. Muller J.M. Loddenkemper R. Roots I.

Similarly, TMA is present at high concentrations in salted and dried fish products whose consumption has been associated with an increased risk of stomach cancer (47Zeisel S.H. DaCosta K.A. Cancer Res. 1986; 46: 6136-6138PubMed Google Scholar, 48IARC Working Group on the Evaluation of Carcinogenic Risks to Humans IARC Monographs on the Evaluation of Carcinogenic Risks to Humans: Some Naturally Occurring Substances: Food Items and Constituents, Heterocyclic Aromatic Amines and Mycotoxins. 56. International Agency for Research on Cancer, Lyon, France1993Google Scholar). Consumption of 100 g of fish such as haddock and cod may increase the concentration of TMA to > 20 µm in the stomach, if the volume of gastric content is assumed to be 1 liter (47Zeisel S.H. DaCosta K.A. Cancer Res. 1986; 46: 6136-6138PubMed Google Scholar). One can postulate that tissue or DNA damage induced by neutrophils in the stomach with Helicobactor pyloriinfection could be accelerated by dietary TMA, contributing to gastric carcinogenesis. In fact, feeding of fish meal markedly enhancedH. pylori-induced gastritis in Mongolian gerbils (49Tanigawa T. Kawamori T. Iimuro M. Ohta T. Higuchi K. Arakawa T. Sugimura T. Wakabayashi K. Jpn. J. Cancer Res. 2000; 91: 769-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Although 8-Cl-(d)Guo has not been studied for mutagenicity, it has been shown that incorporation of both dAMP and dCMP by human DNA polymerases occurred opposite 8-bromo-2′-deoxyguanosine present in DNA templates, possibly inducing G:C to T:A transversion mutation (50Efrati E. Tocco G. Eritja R. Wilson S.H. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15920-15926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). However, in contrast to the templates containing 8-oxo-dGuo, for which incorporation of dAMP is favored over dCMP, dCMP is favored for incorporation opposite 8-bromo-2′-deoxyguanosine (50Efrati E. Tocco G. Eritja R. Wilson S.H. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15920-15926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Further studies are needed to elucidate the genotoxicity and types of mutation induced by incorporation of 8-Cl-dGuo into DNA or those caused by formation of 8-Cl-dGuo in DNA. Chronic infection by bacteria, parasites, or viruses and tissue inflammation such as gastritis and colitis are recognized risk factors for human cancers at various sites (1Ohshima H. Bartsch H. Mutat. Res. 1994; 305: 253-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (961) Google Scholar, 2Ames B.N. Gold L.S. Willett W.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5258-5265Crossref PubMed Scopus (1123) Google Scholar). In tissues with inflammation or infection, various cells in the host immune system are activated to produce various enzymes, including inducible nitric-oxide synthase, NAD(P)H oxidase, and myeloperoxidase, which generate reactive species such as nitric oxide, superoxide anion (O⨪2), and HOCl, respectively (3Ohshima H. Chazotte-Aubert L. Li C.Q. Masuda M. Pignatelli B. Yoshikawa T. Toyokuni S. Yamamoto Y. Naito Y. Free Radicals in Chemistry, Biology and Medicine. OICA International, London2000: 92-101Google Scholar). These reactive species can react with each other to form new and more reactive species. HOCl produced by myeloperoxidase reacts with Cl−, H2O2, O⨪2, and nitrite to form Cl2,1O2*, HO⋅, and NO2Cl, respectively (4Henderson J.P. Byun J. Heinecke J.W. J. Biol.

This study demonstrated that chlorination but not nitration occurred extensively in phagocytosed probes, whereas both nitration and chlorination were catalyzed by secreted myeloperoxidase under extracellular conditions. In the present study, we have found that various nucleosides react with HOCl to form chlorinated nucleosides, including the novel 8-chloroguanosine (8-Cl-Guo). To compare chlorination, oxidation, and nitration activities of HOCl in the presence or absence of nitrite, we carried out the reactions with guanosine and analyzed the products 8-Cl-Guo, 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanosine (8-oxo-Guo), and 8-nitro-Guo by HPLC. We found that chlorination is a major reaction mediated by HOCl, even in the presence of nitrite. Tertiary amines such as trimethylamine (TMA) and nicotine at physiologically relevant concentrations were found to enhance the chlorination"

The increased sensitivity to oxidative stress was largely reversed when glutathione-depleted cells were preloaded with ascorbic acid by exposure to dehydroascorbic acid. Resistance to H2O2 treatment in cells loaded with vitamin C was accompanied by intracellular consumption of ascorbic acid, generation of dehydroascorbic acid, and a decrease in the cellular content of reactive oxygen species.

We found that vitamin C protected cells from death induced by H2O2 in GSH-depleted cells. In the course of its antioxidant action, ascorbic acid was converted to DHA intracellularly and subsequently effluxed from the cells. The efflux of DHA is mediated by the glucose transporters, and the DHA generated was related to the cellular GSH content. We also show that GSH protects HL-60 cells from oxidative stress independently of ascorbic acid. These results indicate that ascorbic acid and GSH are individually important in protecting cells from oxidative challenge.RESULTSEffect of H2O2 on Cell ViabilityDepletion of GSH prominently increased the sensitivity of HL-60 cells to the cytotoxic effect of H2O2 (Fig.1). Greater than 90% of GSH-depleted cells died after a 24-h incubation with 10 µmH2O2. With the same conditions, however, there was nearly 100% viability in cells with a normal content of GSH (Fig.1, A and B). Cellular toxicity was dependent on the concentration and time of exposure to the oxidant, as shown in Fig.1, C and D. Higher concentrations of H2O2 were required to decrease cell viability in control cells (Fig. 1C). After a 4-h incubation with 500 µm H2O2, cell viability was reduced to 50%. Lower concentrations of H2O2do not show deleterious effects on cell survival or proliferative capacity. In GSH-depleted cells, however, there was a rapid increase in cell death (Fig. 1D), and 100% cell killing was observed at concentrations of 50 µm H2O2 or higher after a 6-h incubation. These results show that GSH is a quantitatively important antioxidant, and its absence leaves the cells poorly protected from the oxidative damage induced by H2O2. The variability of the GSH content in control cells, as shown in Fig. 1E, is an aspect already described (11Guaiquil V.H. Farber C.M. Golde D.W. Vera J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9915-9921Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), but these cells are able to maintain their GSH content even when they are exposed to high doses of H2O2. In the case of GSH-depleted cells (Fig.1F), the cells are unable to recover the GSH content mainly because the H2O2 produces a rapid cell death. With lower concentrations of H2O2 these cells show recovery of their GSH content.Vitamin C Protects HL-60 Cells from Oxidative StressGlutathione-depleted and control HL-60 cells were preloaded with vitamin C, by incubation with graded concentrations of DHA, and cell viability was measured after incubating the cells with increasing concentrations of H2O2 (Fig.2). Vitamin C protected cells from killing induced by H2O2. Cells without the vitamin were substantially more sensitive to cell death than those loaded with ascorbic acid. A major role in cell protection by vitamin C was demonstrated in GSH-depleted cells because the ascorbate-loaded cells were more resistant to oxidative damage. A 5-fold higher concentration of H2O2 was required to kill half of the cells preloaded with vitamin C compared with nonloaded cells (Fig. 2A). Control (GSH-containing) cells did not show that level of difference, although it was possible to observe that vitamin C-loaded control cells were more resistant to H2O2 than nonloaded cells. About 50 µm H2O2 killed all of the GSH-depleted cells; however, when these cells were preloaded with ascorbic acid, a 10-fold higher concentration of H2O2 was unable to kill all of the cells present in the assay.Figure 2Vitamin C protects HL-60 cells from oxidative stress.Panel A, dose response for cell survival in normal and GSH-depleted cells loaded with or without 17 mmvitamin C.

Data represent the mean ± S.D. of four experiments, each performed three times.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Vitamin C was found to protect GSH-depleted cells in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2B), and increasing the dose of intracellular ascorbic acid rendered cells more resistant to oxidative damage. This effect was observed at all time points (Fig.2C) and indicates that vitamin C is able to subsume the antioxidant role of GSH in protecting the cells from H2O2. When GSH-depleted cells were exposed to high concentrations (50 µm) of H2O2, however, cell survival decreased to 50% after 4 h of incubation (data not shown). Concentrations of H2O2 higher than 100 µm induced rapid cell death, and vitamin C had little effect on cell survival (Fig. 2D). The extent of cell protection depended on the intracellular concentration of vitamin C and the degree of oxidative challenge.Oxidative Stress Induces DHA Efflux from HL-60 CellsPreliminary data indicated that in H2O2-treated cells an efflux of vitamin C occurred to the extracellular environment. To characterize the exit of vitamin C and understand its role in the mechanism of cellular protection, we performed experiments to ascertain the nature of the efflux and its relationship to the intracellular GSH content and the level of oxidative challenge.Role of GlutathioneCells with different GSH content were preloaded with a low concentration of ascorbic acid and then treated with a high concentration of H2O2. We observed a rapid efflux of vitamin C, with kinetics of efflux which were linear during the first 2 min, and at 10 min almost all of the radiolabeled vitamin C was present in the medium (Fig.3A). The efflux of vitamin C was GSH-dependent; at higher cellular GSH content, less efflux of vitamin C was observed. The rate of efflux as shown in Fig.3B was higher at a lower GSH concentration. These inverse relationships reach a plateau when the intracellular content of GSH was at mm levels. The rate of efflux decreased from 0.3 nmol/103 cells/min in the absence of GSH to 0.17 nmol/103 cell/min at 1 mm GSH. Only a minor change (to 0.12 nmol/103 cells/min) was observed when intracellular GSH was 10 mm. A similar result is shown in a plot of total efflux after a 1-h incubation with H2O2 (Fig. 3C). The data indicate that only a fraction (about 30%) of vitamin C exits the cells when the GSH content is in the mm range. In GSH-depleted cells, the rapid efflux of the vitamin likely reflects oxidation of intracellular ascorbic acid as it functions to protect the cell.Figure 3DHAefflux in H2O2-treated HL-60 cells depends on intracellular glutathione content.Panel A, time course for the efflux of DHA in cells with 10.6 (●), 7.5 (○), 1 (▿), 0.15 (▾), and 0.1 (■) mm GSH content. Cells were preloaded with [14C]DHA to reach a low intracellular concentration of around 300 µm ascorbic acid before treatment with a single dose of 500 µmH2O2. An aliquot of medium was taken out according to the time course and used to measure [14C]DHA on a scintillation counter. Panels B and C, kinetics of rate and total DHA efflux, respectively, of data frompanel A.

Data represent the mean ± S.D. of three experiments, each performed three times.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Role of H2O2The efflux kinetics of vitamin C were studied in GSH-depleted cells preloaded with a high concentration of ascorbic acid and then treated with H2O2 in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Fig. 4A shows that the efflux of vitamin C increased proportionally with the concentration of H2O2 exposure. At concentrations greater than 250 µm H2O2 almost all of the ascorbic acid was found outside the cells at 10 min, whereas only 25% exited the cell at 25 µm H2O2. Efflux was linear during the first 2 min and reached a plateau after this time. During the first min, the efflux rate of vitamin C increased with the concentration of H2O2 (Fig.4B), reaching a plateau at a concentration of 250 µm H2O2. The 50% efflux rate in these cells was seen at about 50 µmH2O2. When total efflux was measured after 1 h of incubation with H2O2 (Fig.4C), the sigmoidal shape of the curve indicated that at concentrations of H2O2 lower than 20 µm, there was less than a 20% exit of ascorbic acid from the cells. These results indicate that ascorbic acid exited the cells in a manner that was a complex function of H2O2concentration and cannot be described by a simple linear relationship.Figure 4DHAefflux in GSH-depleted HL-60 cells depends on the levels of stress induced.Panel A, time course for the efflux of DHA in GSH-depleted cells (0.1 mmGSH).

There was a direct correlation between the exit of ascorbic acid from the cells and the amount of vitamin C present in the cells (Fig.5A). The rate of efflux was slow at ascorbic acid concentrations under 10 mm but increased rapidly at higher concentrations (Fig. 5B). There was four times more efflux of ascorbic acid when 50 µmH2O2 was used compared with 10 µmH2O2; however, there was a fixed efflux of vitamin from the cell independent of the intracellular ascorbic acid concentration (Fig. 5C). At 10 µmH2O2 only a 20% efflux occurred and increased to 60% at a concentration of 50 µm. These data indicate that H2O2 induces only partial exit of the vitamin to the extracellular medium.Figure 5DHAefflux in GSH-depleted HL-60 cells depends on the intracellular content of vitamin C.Panel A, time course for the efflux of DHA in GSH-depleted cells (0.1 mm GSH) preloaded with 0.34 (●), 4.3 (▿), 17 (▾), and 68 (■) mm [14C]ascorbic acid (AA) before treatment with 50 µmH2O2.

Data represent the mean ± S.D. of three experiments, each performed three times.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Ascorbic Acid Oxidation in VitroThe proposed mechanism for the efflux of vitamin C observed in our experiments is the intracellular oxidation of ascorbic acid to DHA, which is able to exit the cell. To test this hypothesis we first studied the oxidation of ascorbic acid in a cell-free system to detect the generation of DHA induced directly by H2O2. Fig. 6A shows the initial velocity of ascorbic acid oxidation induced by H2O2. Oxidation was very slow during the 1st min of incubation at H2O2 concentrations under 100 µm. An exponential increase in oxidation occurred at H2O2 concentrations of 1 mm and above. The shape of the curve did not change when ascorbic acid was increased from 10 to 100 µm. Although the initial velocity of oxidation increased with the H2O2concentration, the efficiency of oxidation of ascorbic acid in vitro was very low compared with the effect of H2O2 on the HL-60 cells. At 50 µmH2O2, the rate of oxidation of 100 µm ascorbic acid is 0.160 nmol/µl/min, which is almost 2 orders of magnitude lower that the rate observed in the HL-60 cells under similar conditions (∼4.5 nmol/106 cells/min, which translate in 13 nmol/µl/min). Total oxidation depends on the ascorbic acid and H2O2 concentrations in solution (Fig.6B). 50% oxidation of ascorbic acid required an increase of 2 orders of magnitude for H2O2 (0.1–10 mm) when ascorbic acid increased from 10 to 100 µm. Total oxidation of 30 µm or lower ascorbic acid occurs only if 10 mmH2O2 is present in the assay. If ascorbic acid increases to 100 µm, about 60% oxidation occurs at the higher dose of H2O2 shown (10 mm). The requirement of high levels of H2O2, which are 2–3 orders of magnitude in excess of the ascorbic acid concentrations, implies that the intracellular efflux of ascorbic acid cannot be explained by a direct chemical reaction between H2O2 and ascorbic acid. The efflux of ascorbic acid shown then could depend on its interaction with intermediate molecules, ROS produced by H2O2.Figure 6Ascorbic acid oxidation induced by H2O2 in a cell-free system. Oxidation of ascorbic acid (AA) in solutions containing variable concentrations of H2O2 was measured at 266 nm at 37 °C.

In the oxidized form, DHA, vitamin C is able to exit the cell through the facilitative glucose transporters. Cytochalasin B is a specific inhibitor of the transport of glucose and DHA through the facilitative transporters. Fig. 7shows that the efflux of vitamin C in GSH-depleted cells treated with H2O2 occurs as described above. With cytochalasin B treatment, 80% of the efflux was blocked. Control experiments using the analog cytochalasin E, which does not inhibit the glucose transporter functionally, shows no inhibition of vitamin C efflux. Cells not treated with H2O2 do not shown any efflux when treated with both cytochalasins. These data demonstrate that the efflux of vitamin C occurs through the glucose transporter.Figure 7Efflux ofDHAis blocked by cytochalasin B. Time course for DHA efflux in GSH-depleted cells (0.2 mm) preloaded with 500 µm[14C]DHA for 30 min at 37 °C, to reach an intracellular ascorbic acid concentration of more than 10 mm. After washing with PBS, cells were incubated with untreated (○), 20 µm cytochalasin B (CytB) and 500 µm H2O2 (●), 20 µm cytochalasin E (CytE) and 500 µm H2O2 (▿), or 500 µm H2O2 (■). Cells were incubated at 37 °C and centrifuged at high speed for 1 min. The supernatant was separated, and [14C]DHA in the pellet and supernatant was evaluated by scintillation counter. Data represent the mean ± S.D. of three experiments, each performed three times.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Antioxidant Enzymatic Activities in HL-60 CellsHydrogen peroxide is quite stable and has a high diffusion rate in solution. To avoid oxidative damage induced by H2O2, the cells must have mechanisms that block the influx of H2O2 into the cells or produce antioxidants that neutralize its deleterious effects. We studied how depletion of GSH changes the enzymatic activities involved with the removal of oxidants. Control and GSH-depleted HL-60 cells decomposed extracellular H2O2 rapidly. By 5 min of incubation with 1 mm H2O2, 80% of the oxidant was removed from the medium (Fig.8A). More than 90% H2O2 was decomposed by cells after a 10-min incubation. These data show that catalase activity is fully active and independent of intracellular GSH. GSH-depleted cells remove H2O2 from the medium at the same rate as cells with a normal GSH content. Sensitivity to oxidative stress in GSH-depleted cells therefore is not directly related to a catalase deficiency. Furthermore, data obtained using a specific inhibitor of catalase (3-amino-1,2,4-triazole) show that cell survival after treatment with H2O2 is the same in control and catalase-inhibited cells (data not shown).Figure 8Antioxidant enzymatic activities in HL-60 cells.Panel A, time course for the removal of 1 mm H2O2 by catalase activity of control without cells (▿), normal cells (○), and GSH-depleted cells (●). H2O2 decomposition was measured using a chemiluminescence assay as described. Panel B, glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities in normal and GSH-depleted cells. The assay was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Glutathione-depleted cells had an internal concentration of 0.1 mm GSH. Data represent the mean ± S.D. of three experiments, each performed twice.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Depletion of GSH does not change the activities of GSH peroxidase or superoxide dismutase (Fig. 8B). Control and GSH-depleted cells show similar enzymatic levels, indicating that they are not involved in the changes observed in cell survival when GSH-depleted cells were exposed to oxidative stress. GSH function in cell protection could then be related largely to the neutralization of reactive oxygen intermediates produced from H2O2. These potentially more destructive molecules could induce cellular damage rapidly if an antioxidant is not present in sufficient concentration in the cells. GSH and vitamin C have the ability to quench ROS and prevent damage.Vitamin C Inhibits the Formation of Reactive Oxygen SpeciesCells undergoing oxidative stress generate ROS as a mechanism of detoxification and cell defense. The use of nonfluorescent compounds that turn fluorescent upon oxidation by ROS is a convenient tool to measure ROS in cells. We used two compounds, DCFH-DA and HE, which measure intracellular H2O2 and O 2−, respectively. Fig.9shows the oxidation in DCFH-DA in cells treated with H2O2. Vitamin C inhibits the formation of ROS in both normal and GSH-depleted cells. As expected, cells with low GSH content produce higher amounts of ROS than control cells. When GSH and vitamin C are present, the generation of ROS is reduced significantly, showing that both antioxidants are involved in the inhibition of ROS formation. The data obtained using HE show the same pattern, although this compound was more sensitive to the conditions of the assay (data not shown).Figure 9Vitamin C inhibits the intracellular generation ofROSin HL-60 cells. The dose response for ROS generation in normal (○), GSH-depleted (●), normal plus ascorbic acid (AA) preloading (▿), and GSH-depleted plus ascorbic acid preloading (▾) HL-60 cells incubated with increasing concentrations of H2O2. Ascorbic acid preloading was obtained by incubating the cells with 500 µm DHA for 30 min at 37 °C. Cells were resuspended in PBS and stained with 5 µm DCFH-DA for 5 min. Oxidation of this fluorescent compound was measured by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis. Data represent the mean ± S.D. of two experiments, each performed twice.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)DISCUSSIONThe precise role of vitamin C in protecting normal and neoplastic cells against oxidative challenge is unclear. In vitrostudies have been confounded by the pro-oxidant effects of ascorbic acid in vitro and the overlapping antioxidant activities of glutathione. DHA enters cells through the glucose transporters and is reduced to ascorbic acid intracellularly (12Vera J.C. Rivas C.I. Fischbarg J. Golde D.W.

Extracellular oxidative events lead to the generation of DHA from ascorbic acid, which can then enter cells rapidly and be reduced back to ascorbic acid (20Wang Y. Russo T.A. Kwon O. Chanock S.

Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 4555-4558PubMed Google Scholar). We have used ascorbic acid loading of HL-60 cells to assess directly the role of vitamin C in protecting these cells from an oxidative challenge induced by H2O2. Glutathione is an important antioxidant and has been associated with the cellular recycling of vitamin C and the maintenance of the vitamin in its reduced state (23Meister A. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 1969S-1975SPubMed Google Scholar, 24Meister A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9397-9400Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Mendiratta S. Qu Z.C. May J.M. Free Radic.

We found previously that when HL-60 cells were depleted of GSH there was no change in their ability to transport DHA and accumulate ascorbic acid (11Guaiquil V.H. Farber C.M. Golde D.W. Vera J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9915-9921Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). We therefore selected this cell line as a model to determine the independent effects of vitamin C and glutathione in antioxidant defense. A clear understanding of the cellular protective mechanisms against oxidants has wide ranging importance because ROS are strongly implicated in human disease as well as in normal cell signaling and the action of certain chemotherapeutic agents and radiation (1Halliwell B.G.J.

Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1717-1726Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) identify two sequences of 10–20 amino acids responsible for the polyphosphoinositide binding activity of intact gelsolin. Peptides based on sequences from either segment 1 of gelsolin (GS135–142) (16Yu F.X. Sun H.Q. Janmey P.A. Yin H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14616-14621Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or segment 2 (GS150–169)) (17Janmey P.A. Lamb J. Allen P.G. Matsudaira P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11818-11823Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) bind avidly to polyphosphoinositides and compete with the parent protein for binding to PI(4)P and PIP2 (17Janmey P.A. Lamb J. Allen P.G. Matsudaira P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11818-11823Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both peptides are polyvalent cations with several hydrophobic residues. Their binding to PPIs is not exclusively electrostatic, because it is much stronger than that of similar peptides that have larger positive charges (17Janmey P.A. Lamb J. Allen P.G. Matsudaira P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11818-11823Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similar sequences are found in other phosphoinositide binding proteins, including phospholipase Cβ (18Simoes A.P.

FEBS Lett. 1995; 365: 155-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Synthetic peptides based on the residues essential for PPI binding in gelsolin retain much of the affinity for PPIs compared with the parent protein but are less selective among different classes of PPIs (17Janmey P.A. Lamb J. Allen P.G. Matsudaira P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11818-11823Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The sequence QRLFQVKGRR competes well with intact gelsolin for binding PPIs and, when added to permeabilized cells, exerts effects consistent with a potent inhibition of the production or presentation of PPIs required to uncap actin filament ends and desequester actin monomers as required for stimulation of actin assembly at the cytoskeleton/membrane interface (23Glogauer M. Hartwig J. Stossel T. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 785-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 24Hartwig J.H. Bokoch G.M. Carpenter C.L. Janmey P.A. Taylor L.A. Toker A. Stossel T.P. Cell. 1995; 82: 643-653Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). In an attempt to construct a fluorescent derivative of QRLFQVKGRR that could be used to stabilize and localize intracellular PPIs after microinjection, one such peptide derivative, rhodamine B-QRLFQVKGRR (PBP10), exhibited properties not observed with the unlabeled peptide or derivatives based on fluorescein, pyrene, or tetramethylrhodamine (25Cunningham C.C. Janmey P.A. Vegners R. Ramage R. Epton R. Peptides 1996. Mayflower, London1998: 317-318Google Scholar). When PBP10 was released into the culture medium from a micropipette outside of the surface of a fibroblast, the cell interior became fluorescent within seconds. Subsequent studies showed that PBP10 at 1–5 μm concentrations was able to block the motility of PIP2-containing phospholipid vesicles within Xenopus extracts in which they otherwise assembled an actin-rich tail similar to that constructed by Listeriamonocytogenes and other pathogens (26Ma L. Cantley L.C. Janmey P.A. Kirschner M.W. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1125-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). PBP10 also strongly stimulates the enzymatic activity of PI3K in vitro (27Hübner S. Couvillon A.D. Kas J.A. Bankaitis V.A. Vegners R. Carpenter C.L. Janmey P.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 258: 846-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and promotes ATP-dependent transport in canalicular membrane vesicles (28Misra S. Ujhazy P. Varticovski L. Arias I.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5814-5819Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) and in permeabilized cells that require PI3K activity, even under conditions where external signals to stimulate PI3K activity were lacking (29Sai Y. Nies A.T. Arias I.M. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 4535-4545Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although the direct binding of this class of peptide on PPIs in vitro and its effect on PPI-dependent cellular processes in intact cells has been reported, the biochemical properties of this peptide are largely unknown, and its effect on cell motility and actin assembly is not reported. In this study we show the biochemical specificity of this class of peptides, explore the generality of its ability to enter live cells, and examine its effects on the actin system in vivo. QRLFQVKGRR (gelsolin residues 160–169) and other peptides were prepared by solid phase peptide synthesis on p-benzyloxybenzyl alcohol/polystyrene resin (30Wang S.S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1973; 95: 1328-1332Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using α-N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl (α-Fmoc) protection chemistry and carbodiimide/N-hydroxybenzotriazole coupling. The side chains were protected as follows: Arg (Pmc), Gln (Trt), Lys (Boc). To couple fluorophores on these peptides, ester derivatives of each fluorophore were created and linked directly to the N terminus of the peptides on the solid phase support. After coupling, the peptides were cleaved from the solid support with trifluoroacetic acid and phenol (95:5, v/w). All peptides were purified by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography on a Silica Gel C18 column using a 20–60% acetonitrile gradient in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and dried. Solution fluorescence of the peptides dissolved in PBS was measured with an LS-5B spectrofluorometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using an excitation wavelength of 565 and measuring emission at 590 nm. In experiments where fluorescent peptides were mixed with phospholipids, micelles of PIP2 or bilayer vesicles composed of other lipids were prepared by a combination of sonication and extrusion as described elsewhere (27Hübner S. Couvillon A.D. Kas J.A. Bankaitis V.A. Vegners R. Carpenter C.L. Janmey P.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 258: 846-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The surface activity of peptides was measured using a Kibron (Helsinki, Finland) monolayer trough as described elsewhere (31Medina O.P. Soderlund T. Laakkonen L.J. Tuominen E.K. Koivunen E. Kinnunen P.K. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 3978-3985PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly 1-ml samples of peptide, dissolved in PBS (7.5 mm sodium phosphate, 140 mm NaCl, pH 7.0), were placed in each of 15 wells in a multiple trough, and the surface pressure was measured 10 min after position of the probe at the air/liquid interface. Kinetic measurements of surface pressure starting 5 s after dilution of peptide from a 20 mmstock solution showed that a stable reading was obtained after 5 min and that this reading remained constant within 5% for at least 30 min for all pressure reported (data not shown). The human melanoma line A7 was grown at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in minimum essential medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 8% newborn calf serum and 2% fetal calf serum. NIH3T3 cells were grown under the same conditions in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% calf serum. A plasmid encoding EGFP fused to the N terminus of human β-actin (pEGFP-actin) was purchased from CLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA) and was transfected into NIH3T3 fibroblasts using a liposomal method (Lipofectin, Life Technologies, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. A cell line that stably expresses EGFP-actin was established by treating the cell with 400 μg/ml G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.). In some cases, where indicated, cells were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde after rhodamine B-labeled peptide treatment. Human blood was collected by venipuncture in a tube containing 0.1 volume of ACD (111 mm dextrose, 85 mm trisodium citrate, 71 mm citric acid) as an anticoagulant from several healthy donors. Platelet-rich plasma was prepared by centrifugation of the blood for 15 min at 110 × g at room temperature. Apyrase (0.5 unit/ml) was added, and contaminating erythrocytes were removed by centrifugation at 300 × g for 5 min. The platelets were sedimented by centrifugation at 1000 ×g at room temperature for 10 min. Then they were carefully suspended in buffer A (139 mm NaCl, 2.8 mm KCl, 8.9 mm NaHCO3, 0.8 mmMgCl2, 0.8 mm KH2PO4, 10 mm HEPES, 5.6 mm glucose, 0.3% albumin at pH 7.35) and filtered on a column of Sepharose 2B equilibrated with the same buffer. A cell count was obtained using a Coulter Z2 particle count and size analyzer. Platelet suspensions in buffer A (3 × 108/ml) were introduced in the prewarmed cuvette (37 °C) of a Chronolog Lumi-Aggregometer (Chrono-Log Corp. Havertown, PA), preincubated 5 min with different concentrations of RhoB-QRLFQVKGRR (PBP10) or RhoB-QRL peptide and stirred at 1000 rpm, before addition of the thrombin (0.5 unit/ml). The aggregometer was calibrated with a platelet suspension for zero light transmission and with a buffer for 100% transmission. Changes in light transmission were recorded for 5–10 min, using a PowerLab/200 instrument and a MacLab Chart program (version 3.2). Platelet suspensions in buffer A (3 × 108/ml) were incubated with 10–50 μmRhoB-QRLFQVKGRR peptide or RhoB-QRL as control peptides at 37 °C for 5 min, without stirring. At appropriate times (0, 15, 30, 60, 120, and 300 min) during platelet aggregation induced with thrombin (0.5 unit/ml) the platelets were lysed by addition of equal volume of lysis solution containing 1.5% Triton X-100, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 120 mm PIPES, 50 mm HEPES, 20 mm EGTA, 4 mmMgCl2, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mmglucose, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 156 μg/ml benzamidine, and 80 μg/ml aprotinin, pH 7.2. The lysate was kept at 4 °C for 5 min and then centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min. The actin content of the Triton-insoluble cytoskeleton was determined by removing the supernatant fluid from the pellet and adding 20 μl of gel sample buffer. After boiling, the entire cytoskeleton was subjected to electrophoresis on 10% polyacrylamide gels in the presence of SDS. The relative amount of actin in each lane was determined by gel densitometry. After electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Immobilon-NC, Millipore) that were blocked by incubation in 4% (w/v) nonfat dry milk dissolved in TTBS (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, 0.05% Tween 20, pH 7.4). After transfer to the membrane, proteins were probed with a monoclonal anti-β-actin antibody (Sigma A5451) used at 1:5000 dilution in TTBS. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were used at 1:5000 dilution in TTBS and 4% nonfat dry milk. Immunoblots were developed with Kodak BioMax MR film using a horseradish peroxidase-targeted chemiluminescent substrate. To isolate human neutrophils, 10 ml of peripheral blood was withdrawn from healthy volunteers into heparinized tubes. The white blood cells were isolated by discontinuous gradient centrifugation and residual erythrocytes lysed by a 5-min exposure to pure water. The remaining neutrophils were collected and resuspended in Hanks' buffered saline solution (HBSS, Life Technologies, Inc.) with 0.5% dextrose. Actin assembly after addition of fMLP at 10−7m was determined by densitometry of actin sedimented by centrifugation essentially as described above for platelets. Fluorescence microscopy was performed on a Zeiss Axiovert 405M inverted microscope (Carl Zeiss, Inc., Thornwood, NY) with various lenses: a 40×, 0.9 numerical aperture (N.A.) Plan-neofluor; a 63×, 1.4 N.A. Planapochromatic; or a 100×, 1.4 N.A. Planapochromatic. For deconvolution microscopy, images were acquired by a DeltaVision system (Applied Precision, Issaquah, WA) and a Zeiss Axiovert S100 2TV inverted microscope (Carl Zeiss, Inc.) with a 63×/1.4 N.A. Plan-Apochromat objective lens and then processed by SoftWoRx software (Applied Precision). Motility assays were performed in a modified Boyden chamber. In each assay, 105 cells suspended in buffer were loaded into the top wells of a 48-well, two compartment chamber (Nucleopore, Pleasanton, CA) separated from the bottom wells by a polycarbonate membrane with uniform pore sizes. Some aliquots of cells were incubated at room temperature with varying concentrations of peptide for 3 min prior to loading. The bottom wells had been filled with buffer containing either fMLP at 10−7mfor neutrophils, 10% calf serum for NIH3T3 cells, or conditioned media for A7 cells. The pore size of the polycarbonate filters was 3 μm for the neutrophils and 5 μm for the NIH3T3 and A7 cells. After a 2-h incubation at 37 °C, the membranes were removed from the chambers, stained, and examined with a Nikon inverted microscope with a 40× objective. The number of cells that had migrated through the membrane was counted for each well. For wash-out experiments, the cells were pelleted, resuspended in 10 volumes of HBSS, and left for varying periods of time at 4 °C before pelleting and resuspending in serum-free media or HBSS at cell concentrations of 2 × 106 for loading into the chamber. The rate of neutrophil motility was also measured by video tracking of randomly migrating human neutrophils stimulated by 10−7m fMLP. Ca2+ release by neutrophils was measured by monitoring the change in fluorescence after excitations at 340 and 380 nm in human neutrophils loaded with 5 μm Fura 2-AM in response to 10−7mf-Met-Leu-Phe (fMLP) as previously described (32Marks P. Maxfield F. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 43-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Platelets were loaded with Fura 2-AM by the method of Heemskerk et al.(33Heemskerk J.W. Feijge M.A. Henneman L. Rosing J. Hemker H.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 249: 547-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Platelets suspended in buffer A (3 × 108cells/ml) were incubated for 45 min at room temperature, in the dark, with Fura 2-AM (2 μm), centrifuged (10 min, 1000 ×g), washed in the same buffer, and resuspended in buffer A containing 2 mm CaCl2. After introduction of platelets in a cuvette of an SLM-Aminco MC 200 fluorometer and addition of agonists, the suspension was stirred (1000 rpm) for 20 s and transient Fura 2-AM fluorescence was recorded for 10 min (Iex = 340 nm, Iem = 510 nm). For intracellular enzyme release measurements, human neutrophils were suspended in phosphate buffer with 2 μm cytochalasin D in either the presence or absence of 10−712-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate. Aliquots of the supernatant were then assayed for the presence of each enzyme by standard techniques (34Absolom D. Sabato G. Everse J. Phagocytosis and Cell-Mediated Cytotoxicity. Academic Press, Boston1986: 95-183Google Scholar). Briefly, lysozyme activity was quantified by measuring the rate of lysis of Micrococcus lysodeikticus(Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO) by a turbidometric method. Lactate dehydrogenase was assayed based on the spectrophotometric measurement of NADPH consumption. Glucuronidase activity was assayed by spectrophotometrically measuring the release ofp-nitrophenol fromp-nitrophenyl-β-d-glucuronide by hydrolysis. Myeloperoxidase activity was assayed by measuring the absorbance change produced by the oxidation of tetramethylbenzidine (35Suzuki K. Ota H. Sasagawa S. Sakatani T. Fujikura T. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 132: 345-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (771) Google Scholar). Platelet secretion was monitored using [5-14C]hydroxytryptamine ([5-14C]HT) release assay, as described by Rogerset al. (36Rogers K.L. Grice I.D. Griffiths L.R. Eur. J. Pharm. Sci. 2000; 9: 355-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Purified platelets were preincubated with [5-14C]HT (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, specific activity 50–62 mCi/mmol) at 0.05 mCi/ml platelet suspension (3 × 108 c/ml) for 60 min at 37 °C. Platelet activation with 0.5 unit/ml of human thrombin was performed in Eppendorf tubes, during 5 min without stirring. Platelets were preincubated with various concentrations of labeled peptides (5–40 μm), during 5 min at room temperature before activation. During the platelet secretion assay a sample of platelet was incubated without the addition of thrombin to measure the amount of [5-14C]HT that was not taken up by the platelets and may have been spontaneously released during the procedure (blank). Platelet activation was stopped by the addition of acetylsalicylic acid (15 mm), and samples were placed on ice for ∼5 min and spun at 12,000 × g for 5 min. 50-μl aliquots were taken from the supernatant and counted for analysis of [5-14C]HT release with an LS-6500 scintillation counter (Beckman). The percentage of 5-HT release was calculated as follows: (amount of [14C]HT − blank/total counts − blank) × 100%. Peptide-lipid binding depends on both the nature of the acidic lipid and the sequence of the cationic peptide. The fluorescence of rhodamine B-QRLFQVKGRR (PBP10) is strongly decreased by addition of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate. Fig.1 a shows that the fluorescence intensity of PBP10 is decreased by 90% at an equimolar ratio of PIP2 to PBP10, whereas PS and PC have little or no effect on fluorescence even at molar ratios greater than 4 PS to 1 PBP10 (Fig.1 a and data not shown). Phosphatidylinositol and PI(4)P are less potent than PIP2 in decreasing fluorescence of PBP10, and the order of their effect on PBP10 is similar to their ability to inhibit gelsolin activity (37Janmey P.A. Stossel T.P. Nature. 1987; 325: 362-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). PBP10 does not appear to distinguish between phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate and PIP2, because the effects of these two isomers on PBP10 fluorescence are not significantly different (data not shown). PBP10 fluorescence is also strongly quenched by lysophosphatidic acid, the only other known inhibitor of gelsolin (38Meerschaert K. De Corte V. De Ville Y. Vandekerckhove J. Gettemans J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5923-5932Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The plot of PBP10 fluorescence versus [lysophosphatidic acid] overlies the data shown for PI(4)P and is omitted for clarity. Interaction of rhodamine B-labeled cationic peptides with PIP2 depends strongly on the peptide sequence. Fig.1 b shows that substitution of Leu for Arg at position 161 abolishes the binding, as does truncation of the peptide at either the N terminus or the C terminus, because neither RhoB-QRLFQ nor RhoB-QVKGRR bound PIP2 with high affinity. As with other rhodamine derivatives, but not unconjugated rhodamine B, the fluorescence of PBP10 is strongly dependent on pH as shown in Fig.1 c. Fluorescence is slightly increased by monovalent salt at constant pH, but no specific effect of divalent cations was observed. The very strong dependence of rhodamine-peptide fluorescence was also seen with most cationic peptide derivatives without regard for affinity for PIP2. However, the fluorescence of rhodamine B itself was nearly constant over the entire pH range of Fig.1 c (data not shown) and higher than that of the peptide derivatives even at low pH. To determine if the membrane permeation activity of PBP10 is associated with an amphipathic character that promotes partitioning to hydrophobic interfaces, measurements of surface tension at the air/water interface were made in the presence of various concentrations of PBP10 and related compounds. In addition to its specific binding to inositol lipids, the amphipathic PBP10 peptide and other rhodamine derivatives also show strong surface activity at micromolar concentrations. Fig. 1 d shows how the surface pressure at the liquid/air interface changes when increasing amounts of PBP10 are added to a solution of phosphate-buffered saline. A significant increase in surface pressure occurs at peptide concentrations between 1 and 10 μm. The dependence of pressure on concentration is not linear, and the abrupt onset suggests a coordinated effect on surface tension common to surface-active compounds. The surface activity of PBP10 is stronger than that of either the unlabeled peptide of the same sequence or the rhodamine B label by itself. RhoB-QRL also shows enhanced surface activity relative to rhodamine B, but this activity is significantly weaker than that of PBP10. However, a strongly membrane-destabilizing peptide such as the antibiotic peptide LL37 is active at one order of magnitude lower concentration. 2R. Bucki, C. Moser, and D. Weiner, unpublished data. The effect of PBP10 is slightly (<30%) stronger at pH 9 and slightly lower at pH 5 (data not shown) suggesting that the effect is only weakly dependent on pH changes that are likely to alter the net charge on the peptide. RhoB-GS160–169 (PBP10) entered several cell types directly without microinjection. Internalization of the peptide, as determined, for example in NIH3T3 fibroblasts, by the emergence of a specific fluorescence-labeling pattern resistant to washing, occurred within 20 s of exposure. This rapid uptake occurred both at 37 °C and 4 °C and was not affected by preincubating the cells with 5 μmcytochalasin D, which inhibited actin-dependent endocytosis (data not shown). Uptake also occurred in melanoma M2 and A7 cells either maintained in culture medium or fixed for 15 min in 3.7% paraformaldehyde (data not shown). Because PBP10 entered cells when added to the medium, the subcellular localization of PBP10 was investigated in NIH3T3 fibroblasts. As a negative control, cells were treated for 5 min with 25 μmRhoB-QRL control peptide, which is cell-permeable but does not bind to PIP2. These cells displayed a punctuate pattern within the cytoplasm, suggesting that this peptide localized in vesicles (Fig.2 A). In contrast, when cells were incubated with 25 μm PBP10, fluorescence localized in cytoplasmic structures morphologically different from RhoB-QRL positive vesicles (Fig. 2 B). PBP10 was particularly dense in the perinuclear region. In addition, PBP10 was also observed on the nuclear envelope, in the nucleoli, and on the plasma membrane. The distribution of PBP10 on the plasma membrane was not uniform but focal. Neutrophils also efficiently took up PBP10, exhibiting a bright staining of the cortical region of cells a few minutes after addition of PBP10 to the medium (Fig. 2, C and D). Because PPI-regulated actin polymerization is implicated in cell motility, PPI-binding peptides would be expected to alter this function when present in the cytoplasm. PBP10 exerted a concentration-dependent inhibitory effect on the directed migration of cultured fibroblasts, melanoma cells, and human blood neutrophils (Fig. 3, a–c). Maximal inhibition occurred at concentrations of 25 μmand above, but motility was impaired at peptide concen"

To better understand apoE-lipid interactions on lipoprotein surfaces, we determined the thermodynamic parameters for binding of apoE4 and its 22- and 10-kDa fragments to triolein-egg phosphatidylcholine emulsions using a centrifugation assay and titration calorimetry. In both large (120 nm) and small (35 nm) emulsion particles, the binding affinities decreased in the order 10-kDa fragment ≈ 34-kDa intact apoE4 > 22-kDa fragment, whereas the maximal binding capacity of intact apoE4 was much larger than those of the 22- and 10-kDa fragments. These results suggest that at maximal binding, the binding behavior of intact apoE4 is different from that of each fragment and that the N-terminal domain of intact apoE4 does not contact lipid. Isothermal titration calorimetry measurements showed that apoE binding to emulsions was an exothermic process. Binding to large particles is enthalpically driven, and binding to small particles is entropically driven. At a low surface concentration of protein, the binding enthalpy of intact apoE4 (−69 kcal/mol) was approximately equal to the sum of the enthalpies for the 22- and 10-kDa fragments, indicating that both the 22- and 10-kDa fragments interact with lipids. In a saturated condition, however, the binding enthalpy of intact apoE4 (−39 kcal/mol) was less exothermic and rather similar to that of each fragment, supporting the hypothesis that only the C-terminal domain of intact apoE4 binds to lipid. We conclude that the N-terminal four-helix bundle can adopt either open or closed conformations, depending upon the surface concentration of emulsion-bound apoE.

Chem. 1979; 254: 4186-4190Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the molecular details of the apoE-lipid interaction remain unclear. ApoE is composed of two major structural and functional domains. The 22-kDa N-terminal domain contains the receptor-binding region, whereas the 10-kDa C-terminal domain has a high affinity for lipid and is responsible for lipoprotein binding (5Weisgraber K.H. Adv. Protein Chem. 1994; 45: 249-302Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Weisgraber K.H. Mahley R.W. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1485-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structure of the N-terminal domain has been shown by x-ray crystallographic studies to be an elongated globular four-helix bundle (7Wilson C. Wardell M.R. Weisgraber K.H. Mahley R.W. Agard D.A. Science. 1991; 252: 1817-1822Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar, 8Segelke B.W. Forstner M. Knapp M. Trakhanov S.D. Parkin S. Newhouse Y.M. Bellamy H.D. Weisgraber K.H. Rupp B. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 886-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Molecular area measurements at an air-water interface suggest that the four-helix bundle can undergo a conformational change exposing the hydrophobic faces to interact with lipid (9Weisgraber K.H. Lund-Katz S. Phillips M.C. Miller N.E. Tall A.R. High Density Lipoproteins and Atherosclerosis III. Elsevier, Amsterdam1992: 175-181Google Scholar). Indeed, recent studies with infrared spectroscopy (10Raussens V. Fisher C.A. Goormaghtigh E. Ryan R.O. Ruysschaert J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25825-25830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), fluorescence resonance energy transfer (11Fisher C.A. Ryan R.O. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 93-99Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and interhelical disulfide mutants of apoE N-terminal domain (12Lu B. Morrow J.A. Weisgraber K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20775-20781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) indicate that the four-helix bundle undergoes conformational opening on phospholipid discs. Although these studies show α-helical reorganization upon lipid binding, the final organization of the helices with respect to one another is unknown (12Lu B. Morrow J.A. Weisgraber K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20775-20781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar,13Fisher C.A. Narayanaswami V. Ryan R.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33601-33606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The conformational reorganization of the N-terminal domain upon interaction with lipid is associated with enhanced receptor binding activity. NMR measurements showed that, when apoE was complexed with dimyristoyl phosphatidylcholine (DMPC), lysines 143 and 146 in the N-terminal domain (both in the LDL receptor-binding region) have unusually low pKa values, reflecting local increases in positive electrostatic potential caused by reorganization of the α-helices (14Lund-Katz S.

The increased electrostatic potential, coupled with enhanced exposure to the aqueous phase of the polar face of the amphipathic-helix containing residues 136–150, seems to explain why lipid association is required for the high affinity binding of apoE for the LDL receptor (14Lund-Katz S.

However, certain apoE-containing lipoprotein particles, such as intact chylomicrons, seem to be receptor-inactive (16Gianturco S.H. Gotto Jr., A.M. Hwang S.L. Karlin J.B. Lin A.H. Prasad S.C.

Lipid Res. 1988; 29: 1087-1096Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it has been proposed that the conformation of lipoprotein-bound apoE can be modulated by lipoprotein lipid composition (20Sehayek E.

Based on the observation that lipoprotein-associated apoE displays variable receptor binding ability, Narayanaswami and Ryan (24Narayanaswami V. Ryan R.O. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1483: 15-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) have proposed two lipid-bound states model of apoE. The C-terminal domain anchors apoE to the lipoprotein surfaces, whereas the N-terminal domain undergoes reversible conformational changes that modulate receptor binding activity. In the present study, we determined the quantitative contributions of the N-terminal and the C-terminal domains of apoE to lipid binding on lipoprotein-like emulsion particles with engineered apoE4 and its 22-kDa (residues 1–191) and 10-kDa (residues 223–299) fragments. Egg yolk phosphatidylcholine (PC) and triolein were purchased from Sigma, and stock solutions were stored in chloroform/methanol (2:1) under nitrogen at −20 °C. [14C]Formaldehyde (40–60 Ci/mol) in distilled water was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. NaCNBH3 (Aldrich) was recrystallized from methylene chloride before use (25Jentoft N. Dearborn D.G. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 91: 570-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). All other salts and reagents were analytical grade. Bacteriological media were obtained from Fisher. The prokaryotic expression vector pET32a was from Novagen (Madison, WI), and the competent Escherichia coli strain BL21 star (DE3) was from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA). The competent E. coli strain DH5α was from Life Technologies, Inc. Polymerase chain reaction supplies were from Qiagen (Chatsworth, CA). Restriction enzymes were purchased from Promega (Madison, WI). Isopropyl-β-d-galactopyranoside, β-mercaptoethanol, aprotinin, and ampicillin were from Sigma. Ultrapure guanidine HCl was from ICN Pharmaceuticals (Costa Mesa, CA). Oligonucleotides were from Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA), and DNA purification kits were from Qiagen. The full-length human apoE4 and its 22- and 10-kDa fragments were expressed and purified as described (26Morrow J.A. Arnold K.S. Weisgraber K.H. Protein Expression Purif. 1999; 16: 224-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) with some modification. The cDNA for full-length human apoE4, the 22-kDa fragment, or the 10-kDa fragment were ligated into a thioredoxin fusion expression vector pET32a and transformed into the E. coli strain BL21 star (DE3). The transformed E. coli were cultured in LB medium at 37 °C, and thioredoxin-apoE expression was induced with isopropyl-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h. After the bacterial pellet was sonicated and the lysate was centrifuged to remove debris, the fusion protein was cleaved with thrombin to remove thioredoxin from full-length apoE4 or the 22- or 10-kDa fragment. For the full-length apoE4, the fusion protein was complexed with DMPC before it was cleaved with thrombin to protect the protease susceptible internal hinge region (this step was not necessary for the 22- and 10-kDa fragments). After inactivation of the thrombin with β-mercaptoethanol, the mixture was lyophilized and delipidated, and the apoE pellet was dissolved in 6 m guanidine HCl, pH 7.4, containing 1% β-mercaptoethanol. The apoE was isolated by gel filtration chromatography on a Sephacryl S-300 column. If further purification (>95%) was needed, the proteins were subjected to gel filtration with a Superdex 75 column or anion exchange chromatography with a HiTrap Q column. Emulsion particles were prepared by sonication and purified by ultracentrifugation as described (27Schwiegelshohn B. Presley J.F. Gorecki M. Vogel T. Carpentier Y.A. Maxfield F.R. Deckelbaum R.J. J.

Appropriate aliquots of stock solutions of triolein and egg PC (weight ratios of triolein/PC were 3.5:1 for large emulsions and 1:1 for small emulsions) were mixed in a glass tube and dried under a stream of nitrogen, and the tube was placed into a vacuum desiccator overnight. For large emulsions, the dry lipids were suspended in Tris buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 0.02% NaN3, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4) and sonicated at 80 watts with a Branson sonifier model 350 and flat tip for 30 min at 50–60 °C under a stream of nitrogen. The crude emulsions were centrifuged at 3,000 rpm in a Beckman GPR centrifuge for 15 min to remove titanium. The emulsions were then centrifuged in a Beckman L7 ultracentrifuge with a SW40Ti rotor at 15,000 rpm for 15 min at 20 °C to remove large particles (creamy layer) and then washed twice with the buffer by resuspending the emulsion and spinning at 17,000 rpm for 1 h at 20 °C to remove any contaminating liposomes. The resulting creamy top layer was collected as large emulsion particles. For small emulsions, the dry lipids were suspended in Tris buffer containing 10% (w/v) sucrose. After sonication under the conditions described above, the emulsions were centrifuged as described above to remove titanium and dialyzed against buffer overnight to remove free sucrose. The emulsions were then centrifuged at 40,000 rpm at 20 °C for 20 min to separate large particles (top layer) and small particles (middle layer). The cloudy middle fraction was collected and respun at 28,000 rpm, 20 °C, for 12 h. The resulting creamy top layer was collected as small emulsion particles. The weight ratio of triolein to PC in the emulsions was 6:1–7:1 for large emulsions or 2:1–2.5:1 for small emulsions. The average particle diameter determined by quasi-elastic light scattering measurements was 120 ± 10 nm for large emulsions or 35 ± 5 nm for small emulsions, respectively. Binding of apoE4 and its 22- and 10-kDa fragments to emulsion particles was assayed with a centrifugation method (29Tajima S. Yokoyama S. Yamamoto A. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 10073-10082Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Saito H. Miyako Y. Handa T. Miyajima K. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 287-294Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The 14C label was introduced into the proteins to a specific activity of ∼1 µCi/mg protein by reductive methylation of lysines with [14C]formaldehyde as described (14Lund-Katz S. Zaiou M. Wehrli S.

Chem. 1993; 268: 23008-23015Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This trace labeling of apoE leads to modification of less than one lysine residue/apoE molecule, and there is no detectable change in the physical properties of the protein. Previously, we have established that reductive methylation of all lysine residues has no effect on the interaction of apoE with lipid (31Lund-Katz S. Weisgraber K.H. Mahley R.W. Phillips M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23008-23015Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 14C-Labeled apoE4 or the 22- or 10-kDa fragment (freshly dialyzed from 1% β-mercaptoethanol and 6 m guanidine HCl solution into Tris buffer, pH 7.4) and emulsions (0.3 mg phospholipid/ml) were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with gentle shaking in 1.4 ml of Tris buffer (pH 7.4) containing 0.25 m sucrose. After incubation, the mixtures were centrifuged in a Beckman L7 ultracentrifuge with a 50Ti rotor at 30,000 rpm (for large emulsions) or 50,000 rpm (for small emulsions) for 30 min. All of the lipids were found in the top fraction, and the radioactivity in 200-µl aliquots of the top and bottom fractions was quantitated in a liquid scintillation counter. The bound apoE concentration was calculated by subtracting the background free apoE concentration in the top fraction; the latter was obtained from the results of centrifugation of lipid-free apoE solutions. Binding data were fitted by nonlinear regression to a one binding site model with the GraphPad Prizm program. Heats of apoE binding to emulsions were measured with a MicroCal MCS isothermal titration calorimeter (MicroCal Inc., Northampton, MA) at 25 °C. All solutions were degassed under vacuum before use. The reactant was placed in the sample cell (1.33 ml) and titrated with 8–10-µl aliquots of the injectant with continual stirring at 400 rpm. Heats of dilution were determined in control experiments by injecting either protein solution or emulsion suspension into buffer, and these heats were subtracted from the heats determined in the corresponding protein-emulsion binding experiments to give the enthalpy of binding. Protein concentrations were determined by the procedure of Lowry et al. (32Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Lipid concentrations were determined with a phospholipid (Wako Chemicals, Richmond, VA) and triglyceride (Sigma) assay kits. 14C radioactivity was assessed by standard liquid scintillation procedures. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (8–25% gradient) in the presence of SDS was performed with an Amersham Pharmacia Biotech Phast electrophoresis system to monitor the purity of the proteins. To assess the lipid binding properties of full-length apoE4 and its 22- and 10-kDa fragments, the 14C-labeled proteins were incubated with small (average diameter of 35 nm) and large (120 nm) emulsion particles at various protein concentrations at room temperature. Emulsion-bound protein was separated from unbound protein by ultracentrifugation. All proteins appeared to bind to the emulsion surface in a saturable manner regardless of particle size (Fig. 1). The dissociation constant (Kd) and the maximal binding capacity (Bmax) are listed in TableI. Full-length apoE4 and the 10-kDa fragment bound with greater affinity than the 22-kDa fragment to both small and large emulsions, indicating that the C-terminal domain has a dominant effect on the lipid binding affinity of full-length apoE4. It should be noted that although a previous study of the distribution of the 22-kDa fragments of apoE among plasma lipoproteins demonstrated that the 22-kDa fragment does not bind to any triglyceride-rich lipoprotein particles (33Weisgraber K.H. J. Lipid Res. 1990; 31: 1503-1511Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), our results clearly showed that the apoE4 22-kDa fragment can bind to some extent to the surface of emulsion particles.Table IBinding parameters of apoE4 and its fragments to emulsion particlesEmulsion particle sizeKdBmaxµg/mlµmAmino acids/mol PCSurface1-aPercentages of emulsion surface area covered with protein assuming that area/amino acid residue in an α-helix is 0.15 nm2.Protein molecules/particle1-bNumber of protein molecules/particle was calculated from particle diameter assuming that the cross-sectional area of a PC molecule is 0.7 nm2.nmapoE4354.2 ± 0.60.12 ± 0.020.82 ± 0.0317.6151208.1 ± 1.41-cp < 0.05 compared to small emulsions (35 nm).0.24 ± 0.041-cp < 0.05 compared to small emulsions (35 nm).0.77 ± 0.0316.5166apoE4 22-kDa3539.2 ± 12.91.80 ± 0.590.32 ± 0.056.8912028.2 ± 7.11.30 ± 0.960.27 ± 0.035.891apoE 10-kDa352.5 ± 0.60.28 ± 0.070.31 ± 0.026.4211201.7 ± 0.40.19 ± 0.050.26 ± 0.025.52171-a Percentages of emulsion surface area covered with protein assuming that area/amino acid residue in an α-helix is 0.15 nm2.1-b Number of protein molecules/particle was calculated from particle diameter assuming that the cross-sectional area of a PC molecule is 0.7 nm2.1-c p < 0.05 compared to small emulsions (35 nm). Open table in a new tab The four-helix bundle of the 22-kDa fragment is thought to open on lipid binding (9Weisgraber K.H. Lund-Katz S. Phillips M.C. Miller N.E. Tall A.R.

Chem. 2000; 275: 20775-20781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). However, a recent study using a disulfide bond engineering approach demonstrated that the initial interaction of the apoE4 22-kDa fragment with DMPC vesicles does not require the complete opening of the four-helix bundle (12Lu B. Morrow J.A. Weisgraber K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20775-20781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). To confirm the bundle opening of the 22-kDa fragment on the emulsion surface, we tested the emulsion binding of the triple interhelical disulfide-linked apoE4 22-kDa mutant (12Lu B. Morrow J.A. Weisgraber K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20775-20781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) in which the opening of the four-helix bundle is completely restricted. This mutant in fact did not bind to either of the emulsion particles (data not shown), indicating that the 22-kDa fragment binds to the emulsion surface with the four-helix bundle in an open conformation, as occurs in the formation of apoE-phospholipid discoidal particles (10Raussens V.

Chem. 2000; 275: 34459-34464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The binding capacity of full-length apoE4 (around 0.8 amino acid/PC molecule) was comparable with the previous data of human apoE3 binding to emulsion particles (34Yokoyama S. Kawai Y. Tajima S. Yamamoto A. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 16375-16382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Derksen A. Small D.M. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 900-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Assuming that all of the amphipathic α-helices in the apoE molecule interact similarly with lipid, theBmax values in terms of amino acids/PC molecule of all proteins should be identical. However, theBmax of full-length apoE4 was much larger than the Bmax values of the 22- and 10-kDa fragments, suggesting that the protein-lipid interaction of full-length apoE4 on the emulsion surface is different from that of each fragment. These results, together with the finding that the emulsion binding affinity of the C-terminal fragment is much higher than the N-terminal fragment, suggest that, at maximal binding, the N-terminal four-helix bundle in full-length apoE4 does not have an open conformation on the emulsion surface. This concept has been proposed by Narayanaswami and Ryan (24Narayanaswami V. Ryan R.O. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1483: 15-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) for the situation in which other apolipoproteins, such as apoCs, induce alteration in the conformation of the N-terminal domain of apoE on spherical lipoprotein particles. To further compare the interactions of both domains with lipid, we used ITC to measure the heats of apoE binding to emulsions. The heat change on apolipoprotein binding to lipid contains contributions from the protein-lipid interaction and from any resulting changes in the α-helix content of the protein (36Derksen A. Gantz D. Small D.M. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: 330-338Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 37Gazzara J.A. Phillips M.C. Lund-Katz S. Palgunachari M.N. Segrest J.P. Anantharamaiah G.M. Snow J.W. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 2134-2146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the heat used or released during the binding process reflects the overall process of protein-lipid interaction. We determined the enthalpies of emulsion binding of full-length apoE4 and its 22- and 10-kDa fragments by injecting small amounts of protein solution into an emulsion suspension of defined lipid concentration (38Seelig J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1331: 103-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Fig. 2shows the results of injecting 10-µl aliquots of full-length apoE4 solution into small and large emulsions, together with a control injection in which apoE4 was injected into buffer only. Because of the large lipid-to-protein ratio, the injected apoE4 is likely to be almost completely bound to the emulsion surface, and in fact the heats of consecutive injections were virtually identical. Subtracting the heats of dilution yielded the binding enthalpies. Using the binding constants given in Table I, a comprehensive set of thermodynamic parameters in apoE4 binding to emulsions was obtained. Table IIsummarizes the enthalpies, free energies, and entropies of binding of full-length apoE4 and its fragments to small and large emulsions. Although the binding to both emulsions was found to be an exothermic process, the binding to large particles was distinctly more exothermic than binding to small particles for all proteins. As a result, the binding to large particles is enthalpically driven, whereas that to small particles is entropically driven. Interestingly, such an effect of emulsion particle size on the thermodynamic properties of apoE-lipid interaction is quite opposite to those found in apolipoprotein A-I model peptide-vesicle (39Gazzara J.A. Phillips M.C. Lund-Katz S. Palgunachari M.N. Segrest J.P. Anantharamaiah G.M. Rodrigueza W.V. Snow J.W. J.

https://openalex.org/W2077516532,"To evaluate the mechanisms involved in macrophage proliferation and activation, we studied the regulation of the nucleoside transport systems. In murine bone marrow-derived macrophages, the nucleosides required for DNA and RNA synthesis are recruited from the extracellular medium. M-CSF induced macrophage proliferation and DNA and RNA synthesis, whereas interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) led to activation, blocked proliferation, and induced only RNA synthesis. Macrophages express at least the concentrative systems N1 and N2 (CNT2 and CNT1 genes, respectively) and the equilibrative systems es and ei (ENT1 and ENT2 genes, respectively). Incubation with M-CSF only up-regulated the equilibrative system es. Inhibition of this transport system blocked M-CSF-dependent proliferation. Treatment with IFN-gamma only induced the concentrative N1 and N2 systems. IFN-gamma also down-regulated the increased expression of the es equilibrative system induced by M-CSF. Thus, macrophage proliferation and activation require selective regulation of nucleoside transporters and may respond to specific requirements for DNA and RNA synthesis. This report also shows that the nucleoside transporters are critical for macrophage proliferation and activation."

Their interactions with the human glutathione transferase P1-1 may reveal an additional physiological role for this enzyme. In the absence of GSH,S-nitrosoglutathione causes rapid and stable S-nitrosylation of both the Cys47 and Cys101 residues. Ion spray ionization-mass spectrometry ruled out the possibility of S-glutathionylation and confirms the occurrence of a poly-S-nitrosylation in GST P1-1. S-Nitrosylation of Cys47 lowers the affinity 10-fold for GSH, but this negative effect is minimized by a half-site reactivity mechanism that protects one Cys47/dimer from nitrosylation. Thus, glutathione transferase P1-1, retaining most of its original activity, may act as a NO carrier protein when GSH depletion occurs in the cell. The dinitrosyl-diglutathionyl iron complex, which is formed by S-nitrosoglutathione decomposition in the presence of physiological concentrations of GSH and traces of ferrous ions, binds with extraordinary affinity to one active site of this dimeric enzyme (Ki < 10−12m) and triggers negative cooperativity in the vacant subunit (Ki = 10−9m). The complex bound to the enzyme is stable for hours, whereas in the free form and at low concentrations, its life time is only a few minutes. ESR and molecular modeling studies provide a reasonable explanation of this strong interaction, suggesting that Tyr7 and enzyme-bound GSH could be involved in the coordination of the iron atom. All of the observed findings suggest that glutathione transferase P1-1, by means of an intersubunit communication, may act as a NO carrier under different cellular conditions while maintaining its well known detoxificating activity toward dangerous compounds.

A well known function of GSTs is to promote the conjugation of the sulfur atom of glutathione to an electrophilic center of endogenous and exogenous toxic compounds, thereby increasing their solubility and excretion (1Jakoby W.B. Habig W.H. Jakoby W.B. Enzymatic Basis of Detoxification. 2. Academic Press, New York1980: 63-94Google Scholar). The Alpha class also displays a peroxidase activity with organic peroxides (14Mannervik B. Chem. Scripta. 1986; 26: 281-284Google Scholar). Because of the considerable level of expression of GSTs in many tissues and their property to bind a number of large hydrophobic compounds, a possible role of “ligandins” (ligand carriers) has been also proposed (15Litwach G. Ketterer B. Arias I.M. Nature. 1971; 234: 466-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar).

Thus, GSTs can be considered as multi-functional enzymes devoted to various aspects of cell defense.Notwithstanding this versatility, GSTs have never been considered to be involved in the complex mechanisms of detoxification or storage of nitric oxide.

Specifically, the α4cytoplasmic domain binds tightly to paxillin, a signaling adaptor protein, leading to increased cell migration and an altered cytoskeletal organization that results in reduced cell spreading. The α4 tail contains potential phosphorylation sites clustered in its core paxillin binding region. We now report that the α4 tail is phosphorylated in vitro andin vivo. Furthermore, Ser988 is a major phosphorylation site. Using antibodies specific for Ser988-phosphorylated α4, we found the stoichiometry of α4 phosphorylation varied in different cells. However, >60% of α4 was phosphorylated in Jurkat T cells. Phosphorylation at Ser988 blocked paxillin binding to the α4 tail. A phosphorylation-mimicking mutant of α4 (α4S988D) blocked paxillin binding and reversed the inhibitory effect of α4 on cell spreading. Consequently, α4 phosphorylation is a biochemical mechanism to modulate paxillin binding to α4 integrins with consequent regulation of α4integrin-dependent cellular functions. α4 integrins are essential for embryogenesis, hematopoiesis, inflammation, and immune response possibly because α4 integrins have distinct signaling properties from other integrins.

The α4 integrin subunit regulates cell migration, cytoskeletal organization, and gene expression in a distinct manner from other integrin α subunits (8Chan B.M.C. Kassner P.D. Schiro J.A. Byers H.R. Kupper T.S. Hemler M.E. Cell. 1992; 68: 1051-1060Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). α4 integrins promote cell migration and antagonize cell spreading and contractility. These biological activities depend on the α4 cytoplasmic domain (8Chan B.M.C. Kassner P.D. Schiro J.A. Byers H.R. Kupper T.S. Hemler M.E. Cell. 1992; 68: 1051-1060Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Indeed, this α4tail markedly stimulates cell migration and opposes cell spreading and focal adhesion formation when joined to other integrin α subunits (8Chan B.M.C. Kassner P.D. Schiro J.A. Byers H.R. Kupper T.S. Hemler M.E. Cell. 1992; 68: 1051-1060Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). We previously used model proteins to mimic clustered integrin cytoplasmic domains (9Pfaff M. Liu S. Erle D.J. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6104-6109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Integrin tails are tethered at their N terminus to membranes spanning presumptive α-helices. More importantly, they have vertical constraints, since they are initially parallel to each other and are in a specific vertical stagger as they exit the membrane. In the model proteins, clustering was mimicked by use of covalent homodimers of these domains. Helical coiled coil architecture provided the desired parallel topology and vertical stagger of the tails. Using these model proteins, we found that paxillin, a cytoplasmic signaling adaptor protein, bound tightly to the α4 cytoplasmic domain (10Liu S. Thomas S.M. Woodside D.G. Rose D.M. Kiosses W.B. Pfaff M. Ginsberg M.H. Nature. 1999; 402: 676-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Mutations in a core nanopeptide paxillin binding sequence disrupt paxillin binding and block the ability of the α4 tail to promote migration, oppose cell spreading, and alter cytoskeletal organization (10Liu S.

Chem. 2000; 275: 22736-22742Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Furthermore, α4β1-dependent adhesion to one of its ligands, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), led to spreading of mouse embryonic fibroblasts derived from paxillin-null but not from wild-type mice (10Liu S.

Consequently, the α4-paxillin interaction plays an important role in the unusual signaling properties of α4 integrins. Cell migration requires rapid temporal and positional modulation of integrin-dependent cellular functions (12Schmidt C.E. Horwitz A.F. Lauffenburger D.A. Sheetz M.P. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 977-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar, 13Palecek S.P. Schmidt C.E. Lauffenburger D.A. Horwitz A.F. J.

Therefore, the importance of the α4-paxillin interaction in cell migration suggested that it might be subject to regulation by cellular signaling events. Phosphorylation-dephosphorylation reactions are among the most widely used signaling mechanisms. Furthermore, the core paxillin binding sequence of the α4 tail contains several potential phosphorylation sites (see Fig. 1A), leading us to assess its potential phosphorylation. In the present study, we identified phosphorylation of the α4 tail in vitro and in vivo, mapped a major phosphorylation site to Ser988, and prepared antibodies specific for phosphorylated α4. Stoichiometries of phosphorylation varied widely in different cell types. However, in Jurkat T cells >60% of surface α4 was phosphorylated as assessed with the phospho-specific anti-α4 antibody. Phosphorylation at α4 Ser988 inhibited paxillin binding to the α4 tail and its physical association with the α4β1 integrin. A phosphorylation-mimicking mutant of α4 (α4S988D) blocked paxillin binding and reversed the inhibitory effect of α4 on cell spreading. Consequently, phosphorylation of the α4 tail at Ser988 is a novel biochemical mechanism to modify α4 integrin-dependent cellular events. ATP and protein kinase A were purchased from Sigma.

For construction of mutant α4, aHindIII-BamHI fragment of the α4integrin cytoplasmic tail was mutagenized in pBluescript vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). The presence of the desired mutation was verified by sequencing, and the HindIII-BamHI fragment was then subcloned into the modified pET15b (9Pfaff M. Liu S. Erle D.J. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol.

Briefly, each recombinant protein was expressed in BL21(DE3)pLysS cells (Novagen, Madison, WI), isolated by Ni2+-charged resins, and further purified to >90% homogeneity using a reverse-phase C18 HPLC column (Vydac, Hesperia, CA). α4·β1A heterodimer tail mimic protein was prepared by oxidization of equimolar mixture of α4 and β1A tail mimic proteins and isolated by reverse phase C18 HPLC. The masses of all recombinant proteins were determined by electrospray ionization mass spectroscopy (APIII, PE SCIEX, Toronto, Canada) and varied by less than 0.1% from that predicted by the desired sequence. Human T cell lines (Jurkat, CCRF CEM, and HuT78) and monocytic cell lines (U-937 and THP-1) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). K562 cells expressing α4β1 were generously provided by Dr. M. Hemler (Dana Farber Cancer Center, Boston, MA). Cells were grown in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 50 units of penicillin/ml, 50 µg of streptomycin sulfate/ml, 2 mml-glutamine, and 1% nonessential amino acids. Human lymphocytes were purified from peripheral blood from normal donors by centrifugation through a Ficoll-Paque gradient (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as previously described (18Rose D.M. Cardarelli P.M. Cobb R.R. Ginsberg M.H. Blood. 2000; 95: 602-609Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Chinese hamster ovary cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% nonessential amino acid (Sigma), penicillin, and streptomycin and transiently transfected with the wild-type or mutant human α4 constructs described above along with human β1 construct using LipofectAMINE reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). 1 µg of recombinant tail model proteins bound to Ni2+-agarose were incubated with cell lysate from Jurkat cells (50 µg of total protein) in HBB (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.7, 50 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.05% Triton X-100) with protease inhibitor mixture (2 µg/ml aprotinin, 40 µg/ml bestatin, 0.5 µg/ml leupeptin, 0.7 µg/ml pepstatin, 0.5 mm Pefabloc) and phosphatase inhibitors (20 mm glycerophosphate, 50 µm sodium vanadate, 1 mm NaF, and 10 mmp-nitrophenol phosphate) for 3 h and washed several times in HBB with protease inhibitors and phosphatase inhibitors. Twenty-minute kinase reactions at 30 °C were initiated by the addition of 35 µl of kinase buffer containing [γ-32P]ATP (6000 Ci/mmol) and 40 µm ATP. The bead-bound recombinant tail was then washed several times with ice-cold HBB, boiled in SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and resolved by 4–20% SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions.32P-labeled recombinant tail mimic proteins were visualized after autoradiography. After washing with phosphate-free medium, cells were incubated for 4 h at 37 °C in phosphate-free medium containing 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum and 0.3 mCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Cells were washed several times with ice-cold phosphate-free medium. Cell lysates and α4 immunoprecipitates were prepared as described below and analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography and Western blotting. Cell lysates were routinely prepared with Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (20 mmHEPES, pH 7.9, 25% (v/v) glycerol, 420 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 2 µg/ml aprotinin, 40 µg/ml bestatin, 0.5 µg/ml leupeptin, 0.7 µg/ml pepstatin, 0.5 mm Pefabloc, 20 mm glycerophosphate, 50 µm sodium vanadate, 1 mm NaF, 10 mmp-nitrophenol phosphate). For co-immunoprecipitation experiments, SL lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.05% Tween 20, 2 µg/ml aprotinin, 40 µg/ml bestatin, 0.5 µg/ml leupeptin, 0.7 µg/ml pepstatin, 0.5 mm Pefabloc, 20 mm glycerophosphate, 50 µm sodium vanadate, 1 mm NaF, 10 mmp-nitrophenol phosphate) was used. Lysates were held in melting ice for 30 min, and insoluble material was pelleted by centrifugation at 16,000 ×g for 15 min at 4 °C. Clarified lysates were precleared with protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 1 h at 4 °C. α4 was then immunoprecipitated by the incubation of lysate from 2 × 107 cells with 1 µg of anti-α4 monoclonal antibody (HP2/1, Immunotech) for 2 h at 4 °C followed by incubation with goat anti-mouse IgG-Sepharose for at least 2 h at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were washed several times in the same lysis buffer, boiled in 1× SDS-PAGE sample buffer, then separated by 4–20% SDS-PAGE (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Proteins were electrophoretically transferred to either nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad) (100 V, 1 h 30 min) or polyvinylidene fluoride membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Membranes were washed twice in Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST), blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in TBST, and incubated with antibodies for 2 h. Antibody binding was detected using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or goat anti-mouse IgG antibodies and visualized with ECL chemiluminescence reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For re-probing with other antibodies, blots were stripped with stripping buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 100 µmβ-mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS) at 65 °C for 30 min. After washing several times in TBST, the membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk containing TBST and reprobed as described above. To label surface molecules, cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline and then incubated with 0.5 mg/2 × 107 cells/ml of sulfo-NHS-biotin (Pierce) for 30 min at room temperature. Unreacted biotin was quenched and washed from the cells with TBS (0.1m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl). Biotinylated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE gel, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and detected using Vectastain ABC kit and ECL chemiluminescence. Phosphoproteins extracted from SDS-PAGE gels were hydrolyzed in 6 n HCl for 1 h at 110 °C. After lyophilization, phosphoamino acids were separated by two-dimensional thin layer electrophoresis (HTLE 7000, CBS Scientific) along with a phosphoamino acid standards mixture on glass-backed cellulose thin layer chromatography plates (EM Science) using 0.58 mformic acid and 1.36 m glacial acetic acid, pH 1.9, in the first dimension and 0.87 m glacial acetic acid, 0.5%(v/v) pyridine, and 0.5 m EDTA, pH 3.5, in the second dimension. After visualization of the markers by ninhydrin spraying, the plate was exposed to film (19Boyle W.J. van der G.P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1272) Google Scholar). Phospho-peptide mapping was performed as described by Boyle et al. (19Boyle W.J. van der G.P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1272) Google Scholar) and Luo et al.(20Luo K. Hurley T.R. Sefton B.M. Oncogene. 1990; 5: 921-923PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, labeled α4 was immunoprecipitated from32P-labeled cells and separated in SDS-PAGE as described above and electro-transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was then exposed to film to localize α4. The band corresponding to α4 was then cut out and incubated with 0.5% polyvinylpyrrolidone 360 (PVP360, Sigma) dissolved in 0.1m acetic acid for 30 min at 37 °C. Membrane fragments were washed five times with water and finally with freshly made 50 mm NH4HCO3, pH 8.0, and treated with 10 µg of TPCK-trypsin (in 0.1 mm HCl) in 200 µl of 50 mm NH4HCO3 overnight at 37 °C. For complete digestion, an additional 10 µg of TPCK-trypsin was added, and the tube was incubated for another 3 h. After the incubation, the remaining NH4HCO3 was removed by repeated lyophilization in a SpeedVac, and the peptides were oxidized by incubation in performic acid. Phospho-peptides dissolved in a small volume of distilled water were spotted on a glass-backed cellulose plate and then separated in the first dimension by electrophoresis, pH 1.9, and separated in the second dimension by ascending chromatography in phospho-chromatography buffer (21Hunter T. Sefton B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 1311-1315Crossref PubMed Scopus (1540) Google Scholar). The phospho-peptides were visualized by exposing plates to Kodak XAR MS film for ∼3 days at −80 °C with intensifying screens. The peptide RDS988WSYINSK was synthesized with or without a phosphorylation at Ser988. Both peptides were purified by reversed-phase HPLC, and their identities were confirmed by mass spectrometry. The synthetic peptides were coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin with glutaraldehyde as the coupling reagent. Rabbits were immunized by intracutaneous injection of the conjugate and were bled at bi-weekly intervals. Antibodies were rendered phospho-specific by absorption with the α4 tail model protein immobilized on Ni2+ chelate resin. Specificities of the final antibodies were verified by immunoblotting. Jurkat cells were surface-biotinylated by sulfo-NHS-biotin as described above, and phosphorylated α4 was quantitatively precipitated from the Jurkat cell lysate in a preclearing step either with PSα4 antibody or with rabbit IgG. Afterward, the remaining α4 in the cell lysate was immunoprecipitated with HP2/1. Immunoprecipitated α4 was separated in a SDS-PAGE gel (4–20%) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and visualized by chemiluminescence after staining with Vectastain ABC. Densitometry (AlphaImager 2000, Alpha Innotech Corp.) was used for quantitative comparisons. Cell spreading was performed as described (10Liu S. Thomas S.M. Woodside D.G. Rose D.M. Kiosses W.B. Pfaff M. Ginsberg M.H. Nature. 1999; 402: 676-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 11Liu S. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22736-22742Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Briefly, Chinese hamster ovary cells were transiently transfected with wild type or S988D mutant human integrin α4 in combination with human β1. Equal expression of mutant and wild-type α4 integrins was observed by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis. Cells resuspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 1% bovine serum albumin were plated on coverslips coated with 5 µg/ml recombinant CS-1, an α4 integrin binding fragment of fibronectin, in 12-well plates and, after spreading for 2 h at 37 °C, were assessed by phase contrast microscopy. Cells that exhibited flattening and the presence of lamellipodia were scored as spreading cells. Digital images were acquired with an Olympus IX70 microscope equipped with CoolSnap digital color camera. The α4 integrin cytoplasmic domain contains multiple potential phosphorylation sites. To investigate possible α4 phosphorylation, we first assessed the capacity of cell extracts to phosphorylate the α4 tail in vitro. A Jurkat T cell extract phosphorylated the α4 cytoplasmic domain but not those of integrins αIIb or β1A (Fig.1B). Because integrins are heterodimers, the α4 tail is paired with that of the β subunit (for example, integrin β1A). However, the α4 tail was phosphorylated by Jurkat T cell lysate when in a heterodimer formed with the β1A tail. Thus, the α4 tail is phosphorylated in vitro by a T cell extract in the presence or absence of the β1A tail. To assess in vivo phosphorylation of α4, we metabolically labeled Jurkat T cells with [32P]orthophosphate. Immunoprecipitated α4was biosynthetically phosphorylated in these cells (Fig.1C). We examined several T cell lines and observed constitutive α4 phosphorylation in Jurkat and CEM (Fig.1C). α4 was also phosphorylated in all of the monocytic cells that we examined (U937 and THP-1) and in peripheral blood T cells as well (data not shown). Furthermore, treatment of Jurkat cells with agonists such as anti-CD3+ anti-CD28 or phorbol myristate acetate did not increase α4 phosphorylation (data not shown). However, several cell lines exhibited little or no α4 phosphorylation. These included HuT78, rat basophilic leukemia, and α4-transfected K562 cells. Nevertheless, the α4 cytoplasmic domain was present in α4 immunoprecipitates formed from these cells (Fig.1C). Thus, the α4 tail is constitutively phosphorylated in vivo in some cells but not in others. To map the phosphorylation site(s) of α4, we first carried out phosphoamino acid analysis of metabolically labeled α4 immunoprecipitated from Jurkat T cells (Fig.2A, left panel) and of recombinant α4 tail labeled by an in vitro kinase reaction (Fig. 2A, right panel). In both preparations, only phosophoserine was detected (Fig. 2A). Thus, the α4 tail is phosphorylated on serine residues in vitro and in vivo. The α4 tail contains 5 serine and 2 tyrosine potential phosphorylation sites (Fig. 1A). A search of the data base of consensus sequence motifs for the potential phosphorylation sites in the α4 tail using PBASE (www.cbs.dtu.dk/htbin/pbasepredict.pl) identified an exact recognition site for protein kinase A (PKA) (XRRXSΦ, where Xindicates any amino acid, Φ indicates a hydrophobic residue, and underlining indicates the site of phosphorylation) around Ser988 (RRDSWS) (22Pearson R.B. Kemp B.E. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 200: 62-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar). To learn whether α4 was a PKA substrate, we assessed the capacity of PKA to phosphorylate the α4 tail in vitro. Both α4 and the α4β1 heterodimer cytoplasmic domains were phosphorylated by purified recombinant PKA (Fig. 2B). To determine whether Ser988 is phosphorylated in vivo, α4 was metabolically labeled by32P in Jurkat T cells. The α4 subunit was isolated by immunoprecipitation followed by SDS-PAGE. Tryptic digests of the isolated subunit were then subjected to two-dimensional phospho-peptide mapping. The phospho-peptide patterns were compared, with those observed with the α4 tail phosphorylated by PKA in vitro. A major co-migrating phospho-peptide spot, labeled 1 in Fig. 2C, was observed (PKA phosphorylated α4 in the left panel and metabolically labeled α4 in the right panel). Thus, the major tryptic α4 phospho-peptide isolated from Jurkat T cells is also present in PKA-phosphorylated α4. As noted above, α4 Ser988 is a predicted PKA phosphorylation site, and the major α4 phospho-peptide from Jurkat cells co-migrates with one from PKA-phosphorylated α4. These data suggest that α4Ser988 is a major phosphorylation site in vivo. To test the importance of Ser988 in phosphorylation, we assessed in vitro phosphorylation of an α4/S988A mutant by both PKA and a Jurkat cell lysate (Fig. 2D). This substitution completely abolished α4 phosphorylation by PKA and eliminated ∼90% of the α4 phosphorylation by the Jurkat cell lysate. Taken together, these results indicate that Ser988 is a major phosphorylation site in the α4 tail. Ser988 resides in the middle of the paxillin binding sequence of the α4tail (Fig. 1A). Consequently, we asked whether phosphorylation of Ser988 could regulate paxillin binding. We examined the binding of recombinant paxillin to α4tail model proteins that had been phosphorylated in vitrowith PKA to stoichiometries of 0.95 mol of PO 43−/mol of α4 tail. Phosphorylation of α4 abolished paxillin binding. Furthermore, paxillin binding could be reconstituted by dephosphorylation with alkaline phosphatase (Fig.3A). Thus, PKA phosphorylationin vitro blocks the binding of the α4 tail to paxillin. As noted above, α4 Ser988, the PKA phosphorylation site, is a major target of phosphorylation in Jurkat T cells. To determine whether phosphorylation of intact α4 regulated paxillin binding, we assessed the co-precipitation of α4 with paxillin. In previous studies (10Liu S. Thomas S.M. Woodside D.G. Rose D.M. Kiosses W.B. Pfaff M. Ginsberg M.H. Nature. 1999; 402: 676-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar), we found that nearly 100% α4β1 in Jurkat T cells could associate with paxillin when the cell lysates were prepared in the absence of phosphatase inhibitors. However, inclusion of phosphatase inhibitors resulted in a 2–3-fold decrease in α4 co-precipitated with paxillin (Fig. 3B). This decrease correlated with a 2–3-fold increase in α4phosphorylation under these conditions (Fig. 3C). Thus paxillin binding to the α4 tail is regulated by phosphorylation of Ser988. The previous results suggested that α4 phosphorylation at Ser988 could regulate paxillin binding. To evaluate the potential biological relevance of this observation, we assessed the stoichiometry of α4phosphorylation. To quantitatively assay α4phosphorylation, we raised a polyclonal antibody against an α4 synthetic peptide containing phosphoserine at Ser988. This antibody was rendered phospho-specific by absorption with nonphosphorylated α4 tail. The absorbed antibody (PSα4) failed to react with α4tail but did so when the α4 tail was phosphorylated with PKA (Fig. 4A). To further assess the specificity of this antibody for phospho-α4, we also examined whether PSα4 recognizes a phosphorylated serine residue in the context of a similar flanking sequence. As shown in Fig. 4A (right panel), this antibody did not cross-react with a GST fusion protein phosphorylated in its PKA recognition site (RRASV). Furthermore, PSα4 reacted with phospho-α4 isolated from Jurkat T-cells (Fig.4B). Reactivity was abolished by dephosphorylation of the isolated α4 with alkaline phosphatase (Fig.4B). Thus, the PSα4 specifically reacts with phosphorylated but not with non-phosphorylated α4 in a sequence-specific manner. We used the PSα4 antibody to assess the stoichiometry of α4 phosphorylation. Preclearing cell lysates with PSα4 removed 60% of the total α4 from Jurkat T cells (Fig. 4C). In sharp contrast, when α4 was dephosphorylated by omission of phosphatase inhibitors, preclearing with PSα4 antibody did not deplete α4 (Fig. 4C). Phosphorylation of ∼60% of α4 in Jurkat cells can account for the 2–3-fold reduction in paxillin-associated α4 when phosphatase inhibitors are present (see Fig. 3B). Consequently, at least 60% of α4 is constitutively phosphorylated in these Jurkat T cells, and phosphorylated α4 manifests reduced association with paxillin. To further address the functional role of α4 phosphorylation at Ser988, we generated an α4 mutant that mimics constitutively phosphorylated status (S988D). To confirm that the aspartic acid substitution mimicked the biochemical effects of α4 phosphorylation, we examined the binding of recombinant paxillin to wild-type and mutant α4 tail model proteins. Aspartic acid substitution at Ser988markedly reduced paxillin binding (Fig.5A). To assess a biological consequence of α4 phosphorylation, we examined the effect of this mutation on α4-dependent cell spreading. Paxillin binding to α4 cytoplasmic domain inhibits cell spreading, and therefore, disruption of this interaction results in increased cell spreading (10Liu S. Thomas S.M. Woodside D.G. Rose D.M. Kiosses W.B. Pfaff M. Ginsberg M.H. Nature. 1999; 402: 676-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 11Liu S. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22736-22742Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). To examine the effect of the S988D mutation on cell spreading, we transiently transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells with either α4 or α4(S988D). Cells transfected with α4(S988D) spread promptly on the CS-1 fragment of fibronectin, a ligand of integrin α4β1 (Fig. 5, B andC). In sharp contrast, cell spreading was markedly retarded in cells expressing the wild type α4 (Fig. 5,B and C). Thus, phosphorylation of α4S988 leads to loss of paxillin binding with consequent alterations in cellular response to α4β1-mediated adhesion. In this study, we found that integrin α4 is phosphorylated on a serine residue(s) and that Ser988 is a major target of phosphorylation. Phospho-peptide mapping showed that the major α4 phospho-peptide was that containing Ser988. Furthermore, the S988A mutation abolished ∼90% of α4 phosphorylation by Jurkat cell lysate. The tryptic phospho-peptide contains two other potential phosphorylation sites (Ser990 and Ser994). However, immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting with PSα4 antibody verified the phosphorylation on Ser988. Consequently, Ser988 is a major site of phosphorylation. Our data show that this site is used by PKA in vitro. However, we emphasize that this site could be a target of other kinases (e.g. Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II, protein kinase G) in vivo. The development of the Ser988 phospho-specific antibody should facilitate the identification of the relevant kinases. Our studies identify α4 phosphorylation at Ser988 as a potential regulator of α4integrin signaling. In particular, the interaction of α4with paxillin (or one of its paralogs) is required for α4 specific promotion of cell migration, enhanced phosphorylation of pp125FAK (focal adhesion kinase (FAK)) and reduction of cell spreading (10Liu S.

Consequently, the phosphorylation will modulate all of the responses dependent on the α4-paxillin interaction. Previous studies report regulatory phosphorylation of integrin tails. For example, Tyr phosphorylation of β3 and β1A tails regulates integrin signaling and migration (23Sakai T. Zhang Q. Fassler R. Mosher D.F. J.

Furthermore, α3 and α6 Ser phosphorylation may regulate cell shape and cell migration (32Zhang X.A. Bontrager A.L. Stipp C.S. Kraeft S.K. Bazzoni G. Chen L.B. Hemler M.E. Mol. Biol.

However, the effects of these α subunit phosphorylations on specific biochemical interactions of the α tails have not been defined. In the present study, we have identified a high stoichiometry phosphorylation of an integrin α tail that regulates a protein-protein interaction that controls biological responses. Temporal and spatial regulation of α4 phosphorylation may thus be an important biochemical mechanism for the control of α4-mediated cell functions."

The molecular mechanism of the HGF-induced growth inhibition of tumor cells remains obscure. We have investigated the intracellular signaling pathway involved in the antiproliferative effect of HGF on the human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line HepG2. HGF induced strong activation of ERK in HepG2 cells. Although the serum-dependent proliferation of HepG2 cells was inhibited by the MEK inhibitor PD98059 in a dose-dependent manner, 10 µmPD98059 reduced the HGF-induced strong activation of ERK to a weak activation; and as a result, the proliferation inhibited by HGF was completely restored. Above or below this specific concentration, the restoration was incomplete. Expression of constitutively activated Ha-Ras, which induces strong activation of ERK, led to the proliferation inhibition of HepG2 cells, as was observed in HGF-treated HepG2 cells. This inhibition was suppressed by the MEK inhibitor. Furthermore, HGF treatment and expression of constitutively activated Ha-Ras changed the hyperphosphorylated form of the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor gene product pRb to the hypophosphorylated form. This change was inhibited by the same concentration of MEK inhibitor needed to suppress the proliferation inhibition. These results suggest that ERK activity is required for both the stimulation and inhibition of proliferation of HepG2 cells; that the level of ERK activity determines the opposing proliferation responses; and that HGF-induced proliferation inhibition is caused by cell cycle arrest, which results from pRb being maintained in its active hypophosphorylated form via a high-intensity ERK signal in HepG2 cells.

The diverse biological effects of HGF are transduced through the activation of its high-affinity receptor, the c-metproto-oncogene product (the c-Met receptor) (34Bottaro D.P. Rubin J.S. Faletto D.L.

The mature form of the c-Met receptor is a heterodimeric protein consisting of a 50-kDa extracellular α-subunit and a transmembrane 145-kDa β-subunit containing a tyrosine kinase domain in the cytoplasmic region (38Park M. Dean M. Kaul K. Braun M.J. Gonda M. Vande Woude G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 6379-6383Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar, 39Giordano S. Ponzetto C. Di Renzo M.F. Cooper C.S. Comoglio P.M. Nature. 1989; 339: 155-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). Binding of HGF to the c-Met receptor induces activation of the tyrosine kinase. The tyrosine kinase domain is highly phosphorylated at two tyrosine residues (Tyr1234 and Tyr1235) that are essential for the catalytic activity of the enzyme (40Komada M. Kitamura N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16131-16136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 41Longati P. Bardelli A. Ponzetto C. Naldini L. Comoglio P.M. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 49-57PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, two tyrosine residues located in the carboxyl-terminal region of the β-subunit (Tyr1349 and Tyr1356) are phosphorylated (42Ponzetto C. Bardelli A. Zhen Z. Maina F. Zonca P.D. Giordano S. Graziani A. Panayotou G. Comoglio P.M. Cell. 1994; 77: 261-271Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar). These phosphorylated tyrosine residues provide binding sites for the Src homology 2 domain of the p85 regulatory subunit of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), pp60c-src, phospholipase Cγ, and Shc (42Ponzetto C.

The Src homology 2 domain of Grb2 binds to Tyr1356 (43Zhu H. Naujokas M.A. Fixman E.D. Torossian K. Park M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29943-29948Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As a result of these interactions, HGF stimulates the activation of PI3K, pp60c-src, phospholipase Cγ, and Ras-ERK signaling pathways. The molecular mechanism of the HGF-induced growth inhibition of tumor cells remains obscure. In this study, we analyzed the HGF signaling pathways downstream of the c-Met receptor in the human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line HepG2, the proliferation of which is markedly inhibited by HGF. We found that both serum-dependent proliferation and HGF-induced proliferation inhibition of HepG2 cells were inhibited by blocking the MEK-ERK pathway, that HGF induced a strong activation of ERK, and that reduction of this activation to a weak activation restored the proliferation of HepG2 cells. We also found that HGF induced the hypophosphorylated form of pRb and that inhibition of ERK activation suppressed this induction. These findings suggest that stimulation and inhibition of proliferation of HepG2 cells are determined by the level of ERK activity and that the proliferation inhibition of HepG2 cells triggered by HGF results from cell cycle arrest caused by pRb being maintained in an active hypophosphorylated form through high-intensity ERK signaling. Reagents were obtained as follows: anti-Ha-Ras antibody from Santa Cruz Biotechnology; anti-ERK2 antibody from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.; anti-pRb antibody from Pharmingen; horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse and anti-rabbit immunoglobulins fromAmersham Pharmacia Biotech; recombinant human HGF from the Research Center of Mitsubishi Chemical Corp.; PD98059 and LY294002 from Calbiochem; and U0126 from Promega. Plasmid constructs pOPRSVI-Ha-Ras(G12V) and p3′ss were provided by Dr. Y. Kaziro (Tokyo Institute of Technology. The plasmid pTK-SEAP, which contains the secreted alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) gene under the control of the thymidine kinase basal promoter of the herpes simplex virus, was obtained fromCLONTECH. pRRE (collagenase-1)-SEAP and pSRE(c-fos)-SEAP were constructed by inserting the Ras-responsive element (RRE) in the collagenase-1 promoter or the serum response element (SRE) in the c-fos promoter, respectively, into pTK-SEAP. pRRE(collagenase-1)-SEAP contains the SEAP reporter gene under the control of RREs, (AGAGGATGTTATAAAGCATGAGTCAG)4, with essential Ets-binding sites. pSRE(c-fos)-SEAP contains the SEAP reporter gene under the control of SREs, (CCCTTACACAGGATGTCCATATTAGGACATCTGCGTCAGC)4, with Ets-binding sites to which the Ets subfamily ternary complex factors bind. Parenchymal hepatocytes were isolated from an adult mouse by the modified in situperfusion method as described (44Morita M. Watanabe Y. Akaike T. Hepatology. 1994; 19: 426-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). HepG2 cells, MKN74 cells, and hepatocytes were cultured in DMEM, RPMI 1640 medium, and William's medium E, respectively, containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 µg/ml streptomycin in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 °C. The plasmid (2.2 µg) was transfected into the cells using the FuGENE-6 reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and the transfected cells were cultured for 2 days. The cells were then cultured in selective medium containing hygromycin B (400 µg/ml) or G418 (1 mg/ml). Cells were seeded at a proper density of cells/well in 12-well plates and cultured with DMEM or RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% FBS for 1 day. Cells were subsequently treated with reagents and cultured further. The cells were harvested after trypsinization, and the number of cells were counted using a hemocytometer. DNA synthesis was analyzed by measuring the incorporation of the pyrimidine analog 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine (BrdUrd) during DNA synthesis. Cells were seeded at a proper density of cells/well in 96-well plates and cultured in DMEM (HepG2 cells), RPMI 1640 medium (MKN74 cells), or William's medium E (hepatocytes) containing 10% FBS. After the proper time, the medium was replaced with fresh medium, and cells were cultured in the presence or absence of HGF. BrdUrd was added to the cells 24 h before measuring DNA synthesis. After 24 h, the BrdUrd incorporation during DNA synthesis was measured using a cell proliferation enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Cells were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.01% EDTA and 0.2 mmNa3VO4 before being lysed with cold lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm Na3VO4, 50 mm NaF, and 30 mm tetrasodium pyrophosphate) containing 5 µg/ml leupeptin, 1 µg/ml pepstatin A, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The lysates were cleared by centrifugation, and the protein concentration in the lysates was determined using the BCA protein assay reagent (Pierce). Laemmli sample buffer (125 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 4% SDS, 20% glycerol, 0.002% bromphenol blue, and 10% 2-mercaptoethanol) or sample buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 0.1% bromphenol blue, and 2% 2-mercaptoethanol) was added to each sample before it was boiled. The samples were then separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes or polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The membranes were incubated with the first antibody for 1 h and then with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h. Immunoreactive proteins were visualized with an enhanced chemiluminescence Western blotting detection system (ECL,Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). 80 µg of protein from the cell lysates were separated on SDS-12.5% polyacrylamide gel containing myelin basic protein (0.5 mg/ml; Sigma) as an ERK substrate. Gels were washed with 20% (v/v) 2-propanol and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, to remove SDS and then with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol. Proteins were further denatured by washing the gels with 6 m guanidine HCl and 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and then renatured with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 0.04% (v/v) Tween 40 and 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol at 4 °C overnight. The gels were equilibrated at room temperature for 30 min in 40 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 15 mm MgCl2, 1 mm MnCl2, 300 µm Na3VO4, and 100 µm EGTA. The in-gel kinase assay was performed in 40 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 15 mm MgCl2, 1 mm MnCl2, 300 µm Na3VO4, 100 µm EGTA, 25 µm ATP, and 8 µCi/ml [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at room temperature for 1 h. After extensive washing with 5% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid and 1% (w/v) tetrasodium pyrophosphate, the gels were dried, and phosphorylation of myelin basic protein was detected by autoradiography. Cells were seeded at a density of 1.25 × 105 cells/well in six-well plates containing DMEM. After 24 h, the medium was replaced with fresh medium, and plasmid pTK-SEAP, pRRE(collagenase-1)-SEAP, or pSRE(c-fos)-SEAP (2.2 µg) was transfected into the cells using the FuGENE-6 reagent. At 24 h after transfection, the cells were pretreated with PD98059 (0–50 µm) for 1 h. The cells were subsequently treated with HGF (50 ng/ml) or isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG; 5 mm) for 2 days. The culture medium was then harvested, and detached cells were removed by centrifugation. The SEAP assay was performed using the SEAP reporter assay kit (Toyobo), and chemiluminescence was quantitated on a Wallac 1420 ARVOsx multi-label counter. It has been shown that the proliferation of the human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line HepG2 is markedly inhibited by HGF (26Miyazaki M. Gohda E. Tsuboi S. Tsubouchi H. Daikuhara Y. Namba M. Yamamoto I. Cell Biol. Int. Rep. 1992; 16: 145-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 27Tajima H. Matsumoto K. Nakamura T.

A. 1992; 89: 373-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Thus, we used this cell line in this study to examine the mechanism of growth inhibition of tumor cells by HGF. For comparison, we also used the human gastric carcinoma cell line MKN74, the proliferation of which is enhanced by HGF (45Shibamoto S. Hayakawa M. Hori T. Oku N. Miyazawa K. Kitamura N. Ito F. Cell Struct. Funct. 1992; 17: 185-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), because nontransformed primary cultured hepatocytes are not suitable for counting cell numbers, which is thought to be a proper method for evaluating cell proliferation. To confirm the opposing proliferation responses of HepG2 and MKN74 cells to HGF, these cells were cultured in medium containing 10% FBS in the presence or absence of HGF, and the cell numbers were counted. Fig. 1A shows a time course of the effect of HGF (50 ng/ml) on the proliferation of HepG2 and MKN74 cells. The proliferation of HepG2 cells was inhibited by HGF. The inhibitory effect first appeared at 3 days and became marked at 4 days. The number of cells was ∼0.45-fold less compared with HGF-untreated control cells at 4 days. On the other hand, the proliferation of MKN74 cells was stimulated by HGF. The stimulatory effect first appeared at 2 days and became marked at 3 and 4 days. The number of cells was ∼2-fold greater compared with HGF-untreated control cells at 4 days. These results confirmed the opposing proliferation responses of HepG2 and MKN74 cells to HGF. In addition to affecting proliferation, HGF induced scattering of cell colonies in HepG2 and MKN74 cells and hepatocytes (data not shown). Next, we examined the effect of HGF on DNA synthesis of HepG2 and MKN74 cells by measuring BrdUrd incorporation during DNA synthesis. The DNA synthesis of HepG2 cells was inhibited by HGF (Fig. 1B). On the other hand, similar to primary cultured hepatocytes, the DNA synthesis of MKN74 cells was stimulated by HGF (Fig. 1B). These results indicate that the effect of HGF on the proliferation (counting cell numbers) of HepG2 and MKN74 cells correlates well with the effect on DNA synthesis (measuring BrdUrd incorporation). Thus, HepG2 and MKN74 cells were used to investigate the intracellular signaling pathway involved in the opposing effects of HGF on cell proliferation. Since the MEK-ERK pathway plays a central role in signaling cell growth (46Seger R. Krebs E.G. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 726-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (3173) Google Scholar, 47Dhanasekaran N. Premkumar Reddy E. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1447-1455Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar), it may be involved in the proliferation inhibition of HepG2 cells triggered by HGF. To examine whether the MEK protein is involved in the HGF-induced proliferation inhibition of HepG2 cells, the effects of specific inhibitors (PD98059 and U0126) (48Dudley D.T. Pang L. Decker S.J.

Chem. 1998; 273: 18623-18632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2728) Google Scholar) of MEK, an upstream kinase of ERK, were tested. Cells were pretreated with the MEK-specific inhibitors and then cultured in medium containing 10% FBS in the presence or absence of HGF. The proliferation of MKN74 cells observed in both the presence and absence of HGF was inhibited by PD98059 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.2B). The proliferation of HepG2 cells cultured in the absence of HGF was inhibited by PD98059, similar to MKN74 cells, whereas the proliferation of HepG2 cells inhibited by HGF was restored by PD98059 (Fig. 2A). It should be noted that PD98059 completely restored the proliferation inhibited by HGF at a concentration of 10 µm, whereas above or below 10 µm, the restoration was incomplete. The growth curve for cells cultured in the presence of PD98059 (10 µm) and HGF was similar to that for untreated cells (data not shown). A similar restoration of HepG2 cell proliferation was observed with U0126, and a concentration of 2 µmcompletely restored the proliferation inhibited by HGF (Fig.2C). These results suggest that MEK activity is essential for the serum-induced proliferation stimulation of HepG2 cells and the serum- and HGF-induced proliferation stimulation of MKN74 cells and, in addition, that it is also required for the HGF-induced proliferation inhibition of HepG2 cells. It has been shown that the PI3K pathway is involved in cell proliferation (51Rahimi N. Tremblay E. Elliott B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24850-24855Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 52Gille H. Downward J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22033-22040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Thus, to examine whether the PI3K pathway participates in the HGF-induced proliferation inhibition of HepG2 cells, the effect of a PI3K-specific inhibitor (LY294002) was tested. The proliferation of HepG2 cells cultured in both the presence and absence of HGF was inhibited by LY294002 in a dose-dependent manner. The proliferation inhibition induced by HGF was not affected by LY294002 (Fig. 2D). These results suggest that PI3K is not necessary for the HGF-induced proliferation inhibition of HepG2 cells, although it is required for the serum-induced proliferation stimulation. In addition, we also examined whether the stress MAPK pathway is involved in the HGF-induced proliferation inhibition, using a p38-specific inhibitor (SB203580) (53Cuenda A. Rouse J. Doza Y.N. Meier R. Cohen P. Gallagher T.F. Young P.R. Lee J.C. FEBS Lett. 1995; 364: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (1971) Google Scholar). The proliferation inhibition induced by HGF was not affected by SB203580 (data not shown). ERK is the main downstream target of MEK (46Seger R. Krebs E.G. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 726-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (3173) Google Scholar, 47Dhanasekaran N. Premkumar Reddy E. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1447-1455Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar), which phosphorylates and activates ERK. Thus, to determine whether ERK participates in the HGF-induced proliferation inhibition of HepG2 cells, we examined the phosphorylation and activity of ERK2 in HepG2 and MKN74 cells treated with HGF by immunoblot analysis and in-gel kinase assay, respectively. ERK2 was phosphorylated by treatment with HGF, and this phosphorylation lasted for 12 h (Fig.3, panels a,−PD98059) and reached almost the basal level after 48 h (data not shown) in both HepG2 and MKN74 cells. ERK2 activity was more strongly stimulated in HepG2 cells treated with HGF than in MKN74 cells (Fig. 3, panels b, −PD98059). PD98059 at a concentration of 10 µm, which completely restored the proliferation of HepG2 cells inhibited by HGF, also reduced the phosphorylation and activity of ERK2 in HepG2 cells stimulated with HGF, but low levels of ERK2 phosphorylation and activity were still detected (Fig. 3). In addition, 10 µm PD98059 reduced the phosphorylation and activity of ERK2 in MKN74 cells treated with HGF, although the reduction in activity was not as prominent (Fig. 3). The phosphorylation and activity of ERK2 were reduced by PD98059 in a"

We examined the ability of HDLs to mediate a functional anti-inflammatory effect by measuring their ability to prevent neutrophil adhesion and transmigration in vitro. Treatment of human endothelial cell cultures with physiologic concentrations of HDLs inhibited neutrophil binding by 68 +/- 5.9% (mean and se, n=6, P<0.05) and neutrophil transmigration by 48.7 +/- 6.7% (n=8, P<0.05). We then examined the effect of HDLs on inflammatory infiltration and subsequent multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), associated with trauma in a rat model of hemorrhagic shock. Rats given human HDLs (80 mg apo A-I/kg, i.v.) 90 min after hemorrhage (which reduced mean arterial pressure to 50 mmHg) and 1 min before resuscitation showed attenuation of the increases in the serum levels of markers of MODS normally observed in this model. Severe disruption of the architecture of tissues and the extensive cellular infiltration into those tissues were also largely inhibited in animals that received HDLs. Human HDLs attenuate the MODS associated with ischemia and reperfusion injury after hemorrhagic shock in rats."

Forgac M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 779-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar, 2Finbow M.E. Harrison M.A. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 697-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 3Nelson N. Harvey W.R. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 361-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). The vacuolar ATPase contains a large cytoplasmic ATPase domain (V1) and a membrane-embedded proton channel, V0. The two parts are connected via a stalk structure that functions to transmit the energy released during ATP hydrolysis taking place on the V1 to drive proton translocation across the membrane-bound V0. The eucaryotic V-ATPase is composed of 13 different polypeptides, with molecular masses ranging from 13 to 100 kDa. Eight of these, subunits A-H, form the cytoplasmic ATPase domain, while the membrane-embedded proton channel is made of the remaining five, subunits a, c, c′, c“ and d. A 14th subunit, Ac45, which is associated with the membrane-bound domain, is present in the mammalian enzyme in some tissues (4Supek F. Supekova L. Mandiyan S. Pan Y-C. Nelson H. Nelson N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24102-24106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).The V-ATPase is structurally and functionally related to the F1F0-ATPsynthase, and it is believed that both enzymes have evolved from a common ancestor (5Gogarten J.P. Kibak H. Dittrich P. Taiz L. Bowman E.J. Bowman B.J. Manolson M.F. Poole R.J. Date T. Oshima T. Konishi J. Denda K. Yoshida M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6661-6665Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). In case of the F-ATPase, a high resolution crystal structure exists for the cytoplasmic domain (6Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2733) Google Scholar), and based on the degree of sequence identity between the catalytic subunits of the F- and V-ATPase, it is likely that the V1-ATPase catalytic core has a similar three-dimensional-fold. The functional element proton channel is less well understood mainly because there is no detailed structure available for the intact membrane domain of either V- or F-ATPase. It is generally assumed that the c subunits are arranged in a ring-like fashion with the a subunit bound at the outside of the ring, and there is evidence for such an arrangement from electron microscopic images of both enzymes (7Wilkens S. Capaldi R.A. Nature. 1998; 393: 29Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 8Wilkens S. Vasilyeva E. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31804-31810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it is believed that the proton channel is formed at the interface of the aand c subunits and that a rotation of the csubunit ring against the a subunit is an integral part of the mechanism of ATP hydrolysis-coupled proton translocation (9Junge W. Lill H. Engelbrecht S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 420-423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar).The structure of the proton channel-forming c subunit of the F-ATPase from Escherichia coli has been determined by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy (10Girvin M.E. Rastogi V.K. Abildgaard F. Markley J.L. Fillingame R.H. Biochemistry. 1998; 25: 8817-8824Crossref Scopus (271) Google Scholar), and it is known from low resolution x-ray (11Stock D. Leslie A.G.W. Walker J.E. Science. 1999; 286: 1700-1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (1077) Google Scholar), atomic force microscopy, (12Seelert H. Poetsch A. Dencher N.A. Engel A. Stahlberg H. Muller D.J. Nature. 2000; 405: 418-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar) and electron microscopy studies (13Stahlberg H. Müller D.J. Suda K. Fotiadis D. Engel A. Meier T. Matthey U. Dimroth P. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) that isolated F-ATPase proteolipids from different species are able to form symmetric oligomeric rings of between 20 and 28 transmembrane α helices. The same is true for isolated V-ATPase proteolipids in that they are able to form symmetric six-membered rings as seen in ordered gap junction sheets from Nephrops norvegicus, which are entirely formed by a protein identical to the V-ATPase c subunit (14Páli T. Finbow M.E. Holzenburg A. Findlay J.B. Marsh D. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9211-9218Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar).The situation in the V-ATPase membrane domain is somewhat more complex in that its c subunit ring contains three different proteolipid isoforms, namely c, c′, and c“. This means that the proteolipid ring in the V0, in contrast to its F-ATPase counterpart, is most likely asymmetric depending on whether all three proteolipid isoforms are part of the ring and what their stoichiometry is. While the ring-like arrangement of the isolated proteolipids is now well established, there is essentially no structural information available with regard to the intact, subunit a-containing proton channel. Here we report the three-dimensional structure of the V0 domain determined at a resolution of 21 Å by angular reconstitution from electron microscopic images of a negatively stained specimen. The model is discussed in the context of the conventional proton pumping function of the V0 but also with respect to a recent report that the free V0 domain may play an important role in vacuolar membrane fusion (15Peters C. Bayer M. Bühler S. Andersen J. Mann M. Mayer A. Nature. 2001; 409: 581-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar).RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONFree V-ATPase membrane domain can be found in endosomal membranes including the membranes of bovine brain clathrin-coated vesicles where it exists in excess over the intact V-ATPase complex (16Zhang J. Myers M. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9773-9778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to the F-ATPase proton channel, the free V0 complex does not function as a passive proton pore (16Zhang J. Myers M. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9773-9778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Schneider E. Altendorf K. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 515-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) and it can be purified as a stable complex containing subunits a,c, c′, c“, d, and Ac45 (16Zhang J. Myers M. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9773-9778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 1 A shows SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of coated vesicle V0domain used in this study. Glycoprotein Ac45 tends to run as a rather diffused band on polyacrylamide gels (4Supek F. Supekova L. Mandiyan S. Pan Y-C. Nelson H. Nelson N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24102-24106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and is best visualized in the gel by prolonged development of the silver stain (right lanein Fig. 1 A). Fig. 1 B gives a graphic representation of the subunits contained in the coated vesicle V0. The a subunit is a two-domain protein with a hydrophilic N-terminal and a membrane-bound C-terminal domain. Studies conducted with the yeast enzyme indicate that the C terminus contains nine transmembrane α helices while the N-terminal half forms a domain exposed to the cytoplasm (21Leng X.H. Nishi T. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14655-14661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The c and c′ subunits contain four predicted membrane-spanning α helices, and it is assumed that the corresponding gene has evolved through a fusion of an ancestral two-transmembrane α helix proteolipid preserved in the F-ATPase (5Gogarten J.P. Kibak H. Dittrich P. Taiz L. Bowman E.J. Bowman B.J. Manolson M.F. Poole R.J. Date T. Oshima T. Konishi J. Denda K. Yoshida M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6661-6665Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). The larger c” isoform displays about 30% sequence identity to the c isoform and contains five predicted transmembrane α helices. All three isoforms contain lipid-exposed glutamate residues (c“ contains two, but only one is essential; (22Umemoto N. Ohya Y. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24526-245232Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) and these glutamates together with polar residues in the C-terminal domain of the a subunit are essential for proton pumping (22Umemoto N. Ohya Y. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24526-245232Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Leng X.H. Manolson M.F. Liu Q. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22487-22493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), suggesting that all three isoforms are part of the proteolipid ring. Subunit d is not membrane-anchored and may be connected to the V0 by interaction with the a subunit cytoplasmic domain (24Graham L.A. Powell B. Stevens T.H. J. Exp. Biol. 2000; 203: 61-70Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Glycoprotein Ac45 is predicted to be oriented toward the luminal side of the complex anchored to the membrane by a single α helix in the C terminus of the polypeptide (4Supek F. Supekova L. Mandiyan S. Pan Y-C. Nelson H. Nelson N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24102-24106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).The stoichiometry of the V0 subunits has been determined by quantitative amino acid analysis for the coated vesicle V0to a1(c,c′)5–6 c“1 and d1, respectively, assuming that the polypeptide migrating with an apparent molecular mass of 19,000 is subunit c” (25Arai H.

Chem. 1999; 274: 28909-28915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Consistent with this assumption are studies in yeast that indicate that both the c′ and c“ isoforms are present in each one copy per complex (27Powell B. Graham L.A. Stevens T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23654-23660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Ac45 was found to be present in varying amounts (26Xu T. Vasilyeva E. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28909-28915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), possibly a result of the fact that clathrin-coated vesicles are derived from both the plasma membrane and the Golgi and that Ac45 might be present only in one of these membranes.Fig. 2 summarizes electron microscopy and image analysis of the V0. Fig. 2 Ashows electron microscopy of the negatively stained V0domain. In the images, the complex appears as a rather featureless globular object. Close inspection of the projections showed that the majority of the molecules had the appearance of a small disc with small globular densities on each side while others seemed to be more or less circular with no discernible features (see arrows in Fig.2 A). A data-set of 10,259 V0 images was collected and subjected to single particle image analysis with the IMAGIC 5 package of programs (17van Heel M. Harauz G. Orlova E.V Schmidt R. Schatz M. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 17-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (1044) Google Scholar). Fig. 2 B shows two averages that were obtained by the bias-free “alignment by classification” protocol (28Dube P. Tavares P. Lurz R. van Heel M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1303-1309Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Members of the class whose average is shown in image 2 of Fig. 2 B are oriented on the carbon film to produce the so-called side-view projection in which the complex is seen parallel to the membrane bilayer. This projection of the V0 corresponds to the projection of the V0 in the intact V-ATPase (see Fig. 2 C; taken from Ref. 8Wilkens S. Vasilyeva E. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31804-31810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), allowing assignment of the cytoplasmic and luminal side of the V0 complex. The other projections are from complexes seen more or less normal to the bilayer (image 1 in Fig. 2 B). The data set was then treated by several rounds of multireference alignment and MSA/classification to extract all the characteristic views of the complex, some of which are shown in Fig. 2 D.Figure 2Electron microscopy and image analysis of the V0 domain.

The structure was refined with an increasing number of input projections leading to a model that was calculated from 97 class averages. The model was then forward-projected along 50 directions distributed uniformly over the entire Euler sphere, and the projections were used as references in a multireference alignment step leading to new input projections. The procedure was iterated until in the end 288 forward projections were used as references resulting in a total of 220 input averages from which the final three-dimensional model was calculated. Fig.3 A shows that the viewing directions are distributed fairly well over the entire Euler sphere indicating essentially isotropic information content in the structure. The resolution of the final model was estimated via the Fourier shell correlation computed between two reconstructions calculated from randomly selected subsets of the input images (Fig. 3 B). At 0.5 correlation (18Böttcher B. Wynne S.A. Crowther R.A. Nature. 1997; 386: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar), the spatial frequency was 0.47 nm−1corresponding to a resolution of 21 Å, while the 3ς criterion (19Schatz M. Orlova E.V. Dube P. Jager J. van Heel M. J. Struct. Biology. 1995; 114: 28-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) indicated that the model contains information down to 18 Å resolution.Figure 3Three-dimensional reconstruction.

Overall, the structure can be described as an asymmetric protein ring with dimensions 11 × 14 × 6 nm (including detergent and lipid), which is capped by protein densities on both sides. One side (see arrow in image 1, Fig. 4 A) is covered by a globular density with a diameter of ∼4 nm. The other side is covered by two elongated proteins, ∼7 × 3 and 6 × 3 nm, respectively, that are arranged as two half-circles (see arrows in image 2, Fig.4 A). One of these two densities is in contact with the asymmetric protein ring while the other is above the ring, connected to the first through a small bridge in the center. The orientation of the V0 in the membrane is such that the single globular density is directed toward the lumen of the vesicle (see Fig. 2 C) suggesting that this density is Ac45 for which a luminal orientation had been predicted (4Supek F. Supekova L. Mandiyan S. Pan Y-C. Nelson H. Nelson N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24102-24106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The narrow connection between the luminal density and the proteolipid ring would be consistent with a single membrane anchoring α helix in the C terminus of the polypeptide (4Supek F. Supekova L. Mandiyan S. Pan Y-C. Nelson H. Nelson N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24102-24106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Additional evidence that supports this assignment comes from electron microscopy of the yeast V-ATPase complex, which does not contain a homologue to Ac45 and which does not show as such a luminal density. 2S. Wilkens and M. Forgac, unpublished results. As mentioned above, Ac45 might be present in less than one copy per complex (between 0.3 and 0.7) as revealed by quantitative amino acid analysis performed with the holo enzyme (26Xu T. Vasilyeva E. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28909-28915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The ratio might be somewhat closer to one for the free V0 found in clathrin-coated vesicles as no class-sums of the side-view projection have been obtained in which the luminal density is missing. It can, of course, not be ruled out that some of the other projections do not have the luminal density bound; the clear presence of the luminal protein in the three-dimensional reconstruction, however, suggests that this is probably not the case to a significant degree. Assignment of Ac45 leaves the N-terminal domain of subunit a and subunit d for the proteins covering the cytoplasmic opening of the channel, again consistent with their predicted orientation.Figure 4Three-dimensional structure of the V0 domain. A, surface views of the V0 domain. The volume used to represent the surface is 470 nm3 corresponding to a relative molecular mass of ∼400,000 (300,000 for the protein and an estimated 100,000 for a stain-excluding layer of detergent and tightly bound lipid). Images 2, 3, and 4 are generated from image 1 by a 90° rotation around the horizontal, a −120° rotation around the vertical, and a −90° rotation around the horizontal, respectively. The arrows in images 1 and 2 indicate the positions of the luminal density and the two cytoplasmic proteins, respectively. B, the inside of the channel as seen toward the lumen (image 1) and the cytoplasm (image 2). The two arrowheads in image 1 indicate the luminal openings of the channel.

The bottom half, looking down toward the lumen, contains two openings roughly 2 nm in diameter, one of which is covered by the single globular protein (see arrowheads in Fig.4 B, image 1). The cytoplasmic opening, which is covered by the two elongated proteins (see arrows in Fig.4 A, image 2), has a diameter of ∼6 nm (Fig. 4 B, image 2). This would imply that the ring forming proteolipids is not arranged strictly perpendicular to the bilayer so they would form a cylinder but rather at an angle to one another to produce a funnel-shaped structure with a smaller luminal and a larger cytoplasmic opening. Channel openings of unequal size, ∼2.5 and 3.5 nm in diameter, respectively, have been seen in atomic force microscopy images of the chloroplast ATPsynthase subunit III (proteolipid) oligomer (12Seelert H. Poetsch A. Dencher N.A. Engel A. Stahlberg H. Muller D.J. Nature. 2000; 405: 418-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar).Fig. 4 C shows contoured cross-sections of the three-dimensional model of the V0 at the positions indicated on the left in Fig. 4 A, image 1. Starting on the luminal side (bottom row, second image from the right) a peripheral density can be seen next to a ring-like structure (see arrow), which can be seen in the cross-sections going from the luminal to the cytoplasmic side. The density is ∼4 × 3 nm and could therefore accommodate a bundle of nine transmembrane α helices, consistent with this density being the membrane-bound C terminus of the a subunit. Although some densities within the proteolipid ring can be followed all the way through from the luminal to the cytoplasmic side (see arrowheads in Fig.4 C), the resolution of the model is not sufficient to define the number and arrangement of all the c subunit-like polypeptides in the proteolipid ring. An asymmetric protein ring comparable with the one shown here for the V-ATPase proton channel can be seen in electron microscopic images of the E. coli ATP synthase (29Böttcher B. Bertsche I. Reuter R. Gräber P. J. Mol. Bio. 2000; 296: 449-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), again confirming that both enzymes share a similar overall architecture in their membrane domains.As mentioned above, the luminal side of the V0 channel shows two openings. The one that is covered on the luminal side by the spherical density seems to lead into the central channel formed by the proteolipids, while the other opening might lead into a cavity formed at the interface of the C-terminal domain of the a subunit and the outside of the c subunit ring. Such a solvent-accessible half-channel had been postulated for the interface of the F-ATPase a and c subunits (30Vik S.B. d'Antonio B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30364-30369Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Higher up in the structure, the two channel openings combine into one large cavity without a clear indication for a boundary between proteolipids and the membrane-bound part of subunit a. It is conceivable that the resolution of the model is not sufficient to show all the details of the structure inside the channel, but it is also possible that the ring-like arrangement of the proteolipids is somewhat perturbed by the interaction with the membrane-bound domain of the a subunit. Proton translocation through the V0occurs via a protonation/deprotonation of lipid-exposed carboxyls in the C-terminal α helices of the c subunits (helix 3 of c“), most likely at the site of interaction with the a subunit. It has been shown by NMR spectroscopy that the E. coli F-ATPase proteolipid undergoes a large structural change when going from the protonated to the deprotonated state (31Rastogi V.K. Girvin M.E. Nature. 1999; 401: 200Google Scholar). The resulting structural asymmetry in the proteolipid ring might allow an intercalation of part of the a subunit transmembrane α helices into the ring as suggested by the cross-sections shown in Fig. 4 C.An additional cellular function for the V-ATPase membrane domain besides proton translocation has recently been reported based on a study with the yeast system. The data show that the free V0domain is involved in the late stage of membrane fusion and that this event involves a close contact between the cytoplasmic loops of the proteolipids of free V0 domains in the fusing vesicles (15Peters C. Bayer M. Bühler S. Andersen J. Mann M. Mayer A. Nature. 2001; 409: 581-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). Calmodulin is then believed to interact with the proteolipids leading to a radial expansion of the proteolipid ring thus allowing the two bilayers to mix and fusion to occur. The structure here presented of the V0 shows that the cytoplasmic side of the proteolipid ring is covered by protein densities, most likely formed by the N-terminal domain of the a subunit and subunit d. This implies that in order for the c subunits of the opposing V0 domains to come in contact, a large structural change would have to occur. Such a conformational rearrangement might be induced by the interaction with calmodulin and/or other co-factors required for fusion. A large conformational change in the proteins covering the cytoplasmic domain of the V0 would also have to occur during binding of the V1 to enable the reported interaction of the N-terminal domain of a with the catalytic A subunits of the ATPase domain (32Landolt-Marticorena C. Williams K.M. Correa J. Chen W. Manolson M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15449-15457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar).While the structure presented here gives a first picture of the subunit arrangement in the V-ATPase membrane domain, studies at much higher resolution will be needed to be able to more fully understand the molecular mechanism of proton translocation in this class of enzymes. In eucaryotic cells, acidification and energization of organelles such as Golgi-derived vesicles, clathrin coated vesicles, synaptic vesicles, lysosomes, and the plant vacuole are accomplished by a vacuolar type ATPase (V-ATPase)1, and its proton pumping action plays a vital role in processes like protein trafficking, receptor-mediated endocytosis, neurotransmitter release, intracellular pH regulation, and waste management (1Stevens T.H. Forgac M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 779-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar, 2Finbow M.E. Harrison M.A. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 697-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 3Nelson N. Harvey W.R. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 361-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). The vacuolar ATPase contains a large cytoplasmic ATPase domain (V1) and a membrane-embedded proton channel, V0. The two parts are connected via a stalk structure that functions to transmit the energy released during ATP hydrolysis taking place on the V1 to drive proton translocation across the membrane-bound V0. The eucaryotic V-ATPase is composed of 13 different polypeptides, with molecular masses ranging from 13 to 100 kDa. Eight of these, subunits A-H, form the cytoplasmic ATPase domain, while the membrane-embedded proton channel is made of the remaining five, subunits a, c, c′, c“ and d. A 14th subunit, Ac45, which is associated with the membrane-bound domain, is present in the mammalian enzyme in some tissues (4Supek F. Supekova L. Mandiyan S. Pan Y-C. Nelson H. Nelson N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24102-24106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The V-ATPase is structurally and functionally related to the F1F0-ATPsynthase, and it is believed that both enzymes have evolved from a common ancestor (5Gogarten J.P. Kibak H. Dittrich P. Taiz L. Bowman E.J. Bowman B.J. Manolson M.F. Poole R.J. Date T. Oshima T. Konishi J. Denda K. Yoshida M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6661-6665Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). In case of the F-ATPase, a high resolution crystal structure exists for the cytoplasmic domain (6Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2733) Google Scholar), and based on the degree of sequence identity between the catalytic subunits of the F- and V-ATPase, it is likely that the V1-ATPase catalytic core has a similar three-dimensional-fold. The functional element proton channel is less well understood mainly because there is no detailed structure available for the intact membrane domain of either V- or F-ATPase. It is generally assumed that the c subunits are arranged in a ring-like fashion with the a subunit bound at the outside of the ring, and there is evidence for such an arrangement from electron microscopic images of both enzymes (7Wilkens"
https://openalex.org/W2059920730,"The molecular basis of atherosclerosis is associated with excessive proliferation of vascular cells. Previous studies have suggested an inverse correlation between the expression of the growth suppressor p27(Kip1) (p27) and cellular proliferation within human atherosclerotic tissue. However, no causal link between diminished p27 expression and atherogenesis has been established. We investigated the effect of p27 inactivation on diet-induced atherogenesis. We find that p27-deficient mice challenged with a high-fat diet for 1 month remain normocholesterolemic and have essentially no visible atheromas. However, when generated in an apolipoprotein E-null genetic background that leads to severe hypercholesterolemia in response to the atherogenic diet, deletion of p27 enhances arterial cell proliferation (approximately fourfold) and accelerates atherogenesis (approximately sixfold) compared with apolipoprotein E-deficient mice with an intact p27 gene. Analysis of apolipoprotein E-null mice bearing only one p27 allele inactivated reveals that a moderate decrease in p27 protein expression in the setting of hypercholesterolemia is sufficient to predispose to atherogenesis. Thus, our study establishes a molecular link between decreased p27 protein expression and atherogenesis in hypercholesterolemic animals."

Previously, we demonstrated the dependence on heparin for the activation/tetramer formation of a recombinant tryptase.

The ability of heparin-related saccharides to activate a recombinant murine tryptase, mouse mast cell protease-6 (mMCP-6), was strongly dependent on anionic charge density and size. The dose-response curve for heparin-induced mMCP-6 activation displayed a bell-shaped appearance, indicating that heparin acts by binding to more than one tryptase monomer simultaneously.

Gel filtration analyses showed that such short oligosaccharides were unable to generate tryptase tetramers, but instead gave rise to active mMCP-6 monomers. The active monomers were inhibited by bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor, whereas the tetramers were resistant. Furthermore, monomeric (but not tetrameric) mMCP-6 degraded fibronectin. Our results suggest a model for tryptase tetramer formation that involves bridging of tryptase monomers by heparin or other highly sulfated polysaccharides of sufficient chain length.

They also play an important role in our innate immune defense against bacterial infections (1Galli S.J. Curr. Opin. Hematol. 2000; 7: 32-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 2Wedemeyer J.

Activation of mast cells (e.g. by cross-linking of IgE bound to Fcε receptor-1 on the mast cell surface) leads to the release of a variety of pro-inflammatory mediators. Cytokines, prostaglandins, and leukotrienes are synthesized and released together with preformed mediators such as histamine, heparin proteoglycan, and various proteases from the secretory granules. The three major classes of mast cell proteases include tryptases (trypsin-like substrate specificity), chymases (chymotrypsin-like substrate specificity), and carboxypeptidase A (3Huang C. Sali A. Stevens R.L. J. Clin. Immunol. 1998; 18: 169-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar,4Stevens R.L. Austen K.F. Immunol. Today. 1989; 10: 381-386Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). All mast cell proteases are stored in their active form,i.e. with their activation peptides removed. Earlier studies indicated that tryptase, in its active form, is a tetramer (5Schwartz L.B. Lewis R.A. Austen K.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 11939-11943Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, determination of the crystal structure of human β-tryptase clarified that the four active sites in the tryptase tetramer are facing a narrow central pore (6Pereira P.J. Bergner A.

Bergner A. Fritz H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1477: 75-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). This results in limited accessibility of the active sites to macromolecular compounds and explains the unusual resistance of tryptase to large protease inhibitors, e.g. those present in plasma (9Alter S.C. Kramps J.A. Janoff A. Schwartz L.B. Arch Biochem. Biophys. 1990; 276: 26-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Although several studies have identified tryptase as a potent pro-inflammatory mediator, its mechanism of action has not been defined, i.e.its in vivo target protein or peptide has not been identified (10Hallgren J. Karlson U. Poorafshar M. Hellman L. Pejler G. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 13068-13077Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 11Huang C. Friend D.S. Qiu W.T. Wong G.W. Morales G. Hunt J. Stevens R.L.

Care Med. 1996; 154: 649-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). One possibility is that tryptase acts by cleaving proteinase-activated receptor-2, which is thereby activated (15Steinhoff M. Vergnolle N. Young S.H. Tognetto M. Amadesi S. Ennes H.S. Trevisani M. Hollenberg M.D. Wallace J.L. Caughey G.H. Mitchell S.E. Williams L.M. Geppetti P. Mayer E.A. Bunnett N.W. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 151-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (784) Google Scholar). In the secretory vesicles, the active tryptases are associated with heparin proteoglycan. Heparin is a glycosaminoglycan composed of repeating disaccharide units of the general structure ((GlcUA/IdoUA)-GlcNAc) n. In its proteoglycan form, the heparin chains are attached to a serglycin protein core (16Kjellen L. Pettersson I. Lillhager P. Steen M.L. Pettersson U. Lehtonen P. Karlsson T. Ruoslahti E. Hellman L. Biochem. J. 1989; 263: 105-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Structural diversity is introduced into the heparin chains byN-deacetylation/N-sulfation of GlcNAc residues and C-5 epimerization of glucuronic acid residues to iduronic acid, followed by C-2 O-sulfation of selected uronic acid residues as well as C-3 and C-6 O-sulfation of glucosamine residues (17Lindahl U. Haemostasis. 1999; 29 Suppl. S1: 38-47PubMed Google Scholar). Because of its high degree of sulfation, heparin displays a high negative charge density and is thus able to interact with the various positively charged compounds in the mast cell. The association of tryptase with heparin has been shown to influence tryptase at various levels. First, it has been shown that heparin is essential to obtain proper storage of tryptase without affecting mRNA expression levels (18Forsberg E. Pejler G. Ringvall M. Lunderius C. Tomasini-Johansson B. Kusche-Gullberg M. Eriksson I. Ledin J. Hellman L. Kjellen L. Nature. 1999; 400: 773-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar, 19Humphries D.E. Wong G.W. Friend D.S. Gurish M.F. Qiu W.T. Huang C. Sharpe A.H. Stevens R.L. Nature. 1999; 400: 769-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). Second, the association of tryptase with heparin is known to be required for stabilization of tryptase after exocytosis (20Schwartz L.B. Bradford T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 7372-7379Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Schechter N.M. Eng G.Y. Selwood T. McCaslin D.R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10628-10638Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 22Addington A.K. Johnson D.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13511-13518Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In this context, it is noteworthy that heparin-binding compounds (e.g. polycations) are strongly inhibitory for mast cell tryptase, apparently by competing with tryptase for binding to heparin (23Hallgren J. Estrada S. Karlson U. Alving K. Pejler G. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 7342-7349Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 24Elrod K.C. Moore W.R. Abraham W.M. Tanaka R.D. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 1997; 156: 375-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). It has also been suggested that the presence of heparin is required in the autocatalytic processing of protryptase to mature tryptase monomer (25Sakai K. Ren S. Schwartz L.B. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 988-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Following cleavage of the activation peptide, tryptase monomers are assembled into tetramers and thereby acquire enzymatic activity. In a previous study, we investigated the possible role of heparin in tryptase tetramerization (10Hallgren J. Karlson U. Poorafshar M. Hellman L. Pejler G. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 13068-13077Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). A recombinant mouse tryptase, mouse mast cell protease-6 (mMCP-6),1was expressed with an N-terminal His tag followed by an enterokinase cleavage site replacing the native activation peptide. Enterokinase cleavage of this fusion protein thus yielded the mature tryptase monomer. Using this recombinant tryptase, we showed that heparin is required for the assembly of monomeric inactive tryptase to active tetramers and that tetramerization only occurs at acidic pH (below ∼6.5) (10Hallgren J. Karlson U. Poorafshar M. Hellman L. Pejler G. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 13068-13077Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The strong pH dependence of the tetramerization process indicated that histidine residues, which are positively charged at pH <6.5, but uncharged at neutral pH, may be involved in the interaction with heparin. In this study, we have investigated the mechanism and structural requirements (in terms of heparin) for the assembly of inactive tryptase monomers into active tetramers. Our results indicate that tryptase tetramerization involves bridging of tryptase monomers by heparin or similar highly sulfated polysaccharides of sufficient chain length. When heparin oligosaccharides of shorter length are used, active tryptase monomers are instead formed. All studies were performed using mMCP-6. The expression, purification, and activation of mMCP-6 have been previously described (10Hallgren J. Karlson U. Poorafshar M. Hellman L. Pejler G. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 13068-13077Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Briefly, a mMCP-6 construct inserted in the pCEP-Pu2 vector was transfected into human 293 cells. This vector also contained the BM40 signal peptide, which ensures secretion of the protein into the culture medium. The recombinant protein was constructed with an N-terminal 6-histidine tag followed by an enterokinase (EK) cleavage site, which replaced the natural activation peptide. His6-EK-mMCP-6 was purified on Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (QIAGEN GmbH, Hilden, Germany) according to instructions provided by the manufacturer. To obtain mature mMCP-6 monomers, the His6-EK-mMCP-6 fusion protein was digested overnight (37 °C) with enterokinase at an enterokinase/mMCP-6 ratio of 1:500 (w/w) in PBS (10 mm phosphate, 0.14 m NaCl, and 2.7 mm KCl, pH 6). Active mMCP-6 was obtained after incubating the protein with heparin at pH 6 as described (10Hallgren J. Karlson U. Poorafshar M. Hellman L. Pejler G. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 13068-13077Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) (see also below). Unlabeled pig mucosal heparin (Mr∼15,000), heparan sulfate from whale lung, dermatan sulfate, and3H-labeled heparin (25,000 cpm/μg) were gifts from Ulf Lindahl (Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden).

The chromogenic substrate S-2288 (H-d-Ile-Pro-Argp-nitroanilide) was from Chromogenix (Mölndal, Sweden). Bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI) was purchased from Sigma. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in a Laemmli system was performed with 12% polyacrylamide gels under nonreducing conditions. Gels were stained with Coomassie Blue. Enzymatic assays were performed in 96-well microtiter plates. mMCP-6 (100–200 ng) was incubated with different saccharides (445 pm to 44.5 μm) in PBS (total volume of 130–260 μl), pH 6, for 30 min. In one set of experiments, the standard PBS buffer (0.14 m NaCl) was replaced by phosphate buffers containing 0–0.5 m NaCl. Subsequently, mMCP-6 activity was recorded using a Titertek Multiscan spectrophotometer (Flow Laboratories) after addition of 20 μl of a 2 mm solution of S-2288 in H2O. The binding of mMCP-6 to heparin was studied using the nitrocellulose filter disc assay of Pejler (30Pejler G. Biochem. J. 1996; 320: 897-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) with modifications. 3 μg of enterokinase-digested His6-EK-mMCP-6 was incubated with [3H]heparin (intact; 0.48–360 pmol, 180–136,000 cpm) or [3H]heparin oligosaccharides of various sizes (80 pmol; 4500 cpm) in a total volume of 400 μl of PBS, pH 6, for 30 min. The incubation mixtures were rapidly passed through prewashed (with PBS, pH 6) nitrocellulose filters (25-mm diameter, 0.45-μm pore size; Sartorius Corp.) using a vacuum suction apparatus. Subsequently, the filters were washed with PBS, pH 6 (2 × 5 ml), and transferred into scintillation vials. Bound radioactivity was eluted from the filters by addition of 2 ml of 100 mm NaOH and 2m NaCl. After 30 min, 5 ml of scintillation fluid (OptiPhase HiPhase 3, Wallac) was added, and radioactivity was quantified with a β-scintillation counter. Size-exclusion gel chromatography was performed in a fast protein liquid chromatography system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using a Superdex 200 column (10 × 300 mm). The column was equilibrated and eluted with PBS, pH 6, and run at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Calibration was performed with the following standards (all from Sigma): carbonic anhydrase (29 kDa), bovine serum albumin (66 kDa), alcohol dehydrogenase (150 kDa), α-amylase (200 kDa), and blue dextran (2000 kDa). Enterokinase-digested His6-EK-mMCP-6 (10–20 μg, 0.33–0.66 nmol) was analyzed either alone or after preincubation with 3.3 nmol of either intact heparin or various heparin oligosaccharides of 20, 10, or 4 saccharide units. Absorbance was recorded at 280 nm. 0.5-ml fractions were collected from which 200-μl samples were analyzed for tryptase activity after addition of 20 μl of 2 mm S-2288. In the inhibition studies, 100 μl of the fractions was transferred to 96-well plates and either not treated further or mixed with 2 μg of protease inhibitor (BPTI, α1-antitrypsin, soybean trypsin inhibitor) in 10 μl of PBS. After an incubation time of 30 min, residual tryptase activity was determined as described above. In a previous study, we showed that the activation and tetramer formation of a recombinant tryptase, mMCP-6, is dependent on heparin and acidic pH (10Hallgren J. Karlson U. Poorafshar M. Hellman L. Pejler G. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 13068-13077Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In this study, we examined the mechanism and structural requirements for the heparin-induced tryptase activation. First, we investigated whether other structurally related saccharides were capable of replacing heparin as tryptase activators. Monomeric mMCP-6 was incubated with heparin, heparin proteoglycan, heparan sulfate, dermatan sulfate, chondroitin sulfate (A, C, or E), or dextran sulfate at increasing concentrations and was then assayed with the chromogenic substrate S-2288 for tryptase activity (Fig.1). As expected, both heparin and heparin proteoglycan produced active tryptase. In addition, dextran sulfate proved to be an effective tryptase activator. In fact, dextran sulfate was even more effective than heparin. In contrast, heparan sulfate, dermatan sulfate, and chondroitin sulfates A and C did not give any detectable activation of mMCP-6. Chondroitin sulfate E at high concentrations produced measurable tryptase activation, although the levels of activity were much lower than those obtained with heparin or dextran sulfate. To investigate the heparin size requirements for mMCP-6 activation, we used heparin oligosaccharides of increasing chain lengths (4–26 saccharide units). None of these oligosaccharides were as effective as intact heparin in production of active tryptase (Fig.2). However, clearly measurable levels of tryptase activity were seen after incubation with several of the various oligosaccharides, and an increased ability to activate mMCP-6 with increasing chain length was observed. A possible explanation for the limited ability of the heparin oligosaccharides to produce active tryptase could be that shorter heparin chains require longer incubation times to achieve tryptase activation. To test this, we compared heparin and 20-unit saccharides at three different concentrations for their ability to activate mMCP-6 over time. The results shown in Fig. 3demonstrate that the 20-unit saccharides gave a lower level of maximal activity compared with intact heparin, in agreement with the results shown in Fig. 2. Furthermore, the maximal levels of activities were reached at equal rates both for the 20-unit saccharides and intact heparin. Heparin contains sulfate groups at various positions: the uronic acid residues (both GlcUA and IdoUA) can be 2-O-sulfated, and the glucosamine residues can carry 6-O-sulfate and/orN-sulfate groups. In addition, in rare cases, the glucosamine residues may contain 3-O-sulfate groups. To determine whether tryptase activation shows a requirement for sulfate groups located at any of these specific positions, we tested whether various chemically modified heparins were able to activate mMCP-6 (Fig.4). However, preferentially 2-O-desulfated, 6-O-desulfated, andN-desulfated heparins were approximately equally effective as activators of tryptase, indicating that none of the various sulfate groups are of critical importance. Although all of these modified heparins were capable of activating mMCP-6, none were as effective as intact heparin. It has been reported previously (22Addington A.K. Johnson D.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13511-13518Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 31Kozik A. Potempa J. Travis J. Biochim. Biophys.

J. 1987; 248: 821-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) that high NaCl concentrations (∼1 m) stabilize the activity of human lung tryptase by preventing dissociation of the tryptase tetramer. Here we investigated whether also the mMCP-6 activation process was influenced by the concentration of NaCl. In contrast to the beneficial effect of high [NaCl] on tryptase stabilization, we found that mMCP-6 activation was most efficient at low NaCl concentrations, up to ∼0.14 m (Fig. 5). At higher NaCl concentrations, the possibility to obtain active tryptase after addition of heparin fell drastically, with complete inhibition of the activation process at NaCl concentrations above ∼0.3m (Fig. 5). To investigate if tryptase activation is dependent on the concentrations of tryptase and heparin, three concentrations of mMCP-6 were incubated with increasing concentrations of heparin (Fig.6). The results show that the specific activity of mMCP-6 increased markedly with increasing mMCP-6 concentration. Furthermore, at all mMCP-6 concentrations, we noted bell-shaped dose-response curves for heparin, where the tryptase activity levels first reached a maximal plateau, but then decreased markedly at excess heparin concentrations (Fig. 6). Binding studies were performed in which monomeric mMCP-6 was incubated with 3H-labeled heparin. Tryptase-bound radioactivity was then determined using the nitrocellulose filter disc assay (see “Experimental Procedures”). The same samples were also assayed for tryptase activity to directly correlate binding and activation (Fig.7). Saturation of the binding occurred at a heparin/tryptase ratio of ∼1:1. However, the activity continued to increase at higher heparin concentrations than those required for maximal binding. Next, binding studies were performed in which3H-labeled oligosaccharides (4–24 saccharide units) were incubated with mMCP-6, followed by the nitrocellulose filter disc assay. The results shown in Fig. 8indicate that the minimal heparin chain size required for binding was 8–10 saccharide units.Figure 8Binding of heparin oligosaccharides to mMCP-6. Enterokinase-digested His6-EK-mMCP-6 (3 μg in 400 μl of PBS, pH 6; 250 nm) was incubated with 200 nm [3H]heparin oligosaccharides of the indicated sizes. After 30 min, binding of 3H-labeled oligosaccharides to mMCP-6 was analyzed by the nitrocellulose filter disc assay (see “Experimental Procedures”). The results shown represent the means ± S.D. of triplicate determinations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) In a previous report, we showed that addition of intact heparin to mMCP-6 monomers results in the formation of active tetramers (10Hallgren J. Karlson U. Poorafshar M. Hellman L. Pejler G. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 13068-13077Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Here we used size-exclusion gel chromatography to study the effect of heparin oligosaccharides on mMCP-6 tetramerization. Mature monomeric mMCP-6 was incubated either alone or together with heparin 4-, 10-, or 20-unit saccharides or intact heparin and analyzed on a Superdex 200 column (Fig.9). In the absence of added heparin, no tetramer formation was seen, and no enzymatic activity was detected (Fig. 9 A). Addition of intact heparin transferred approximately half of the material into tetramers and resulted in generation of enzymatic activity, of which essentially all was found in the tetramer fraction (Fig. 9 B). Previous studies showed that if heparin is added at a larger molar excess, complete tetramerization is obtained (10Hallgren J. Karlson U. Poorafshar M. Hellman L. Pejler G. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 13068-13077Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Incubation of monomeric mMCP-6 with heparin 4-unit saccharides did not result in any detectable tetramerization or activation (Fig. 9 C). No tetramerization was obtained with the 10-unit saccharide. However, clearly detectable activity was found in the monomer peak after addition of heparin 10-unit saccharides to mMCP-6 (Fig. 9 D). Incubation of monomeric mMCP-6 with 20-unit saccharides produced a detectable tetramer peak (∼15% of the protein), although the majority of the protein eluted in the monomer fraction. Again, the monomer fractions displayed enzymatic activity. However, comparison of the height of the protein (A280) and activity peaks indicated that the specific activity was considerably higher for the tryptase recovered in the tetramer fraction compared with the monomer fraction. To make sure that the activity found in the monomer fraction was due to monomers and not tetramers that had been assembled after the chromatography step, monomer fractions were pooled and rerun on the Superdex 200 column. Again, the activity was found in the monomer position (data not shown). To obtain further proof for the formation of active monomers, we compared the susceptibility of the tetramer and monomer fractions of mMCP-6 to various protease inhibitors. Neither soybean trypsin inhibitor nor α1-antitrypsin inhibited tryptase activities eluted in the tetramer or monomer fractions (data not shown). In contrast, BPTI inhibited the tryptase activity in the monomer (but not tetramer) fractions (Fig.10). Both the monomeric and tetrameric tryptases were inhibited by protamine, a polycationic heparin antagonist (data not shown). Earlier studies have indicated that fibronectin is a substrate for tryptase (33Lohi J. Harvima I. Keski-Oja J. J. Cell. Biochem. 1992; 50: 337-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 34Kaminska R. Helisalmi P. Harvima R.J. Naukkarinen A. Horsmanheimo M. Harvima I.T. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1999; 113: 567-573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Further experiments were conducted to assess whether fibronectin is a substrate for both tetrameric and monomeric tryptases. Monomeric active tryptase was obtained after incubation of monomeric mMCP-6 with 20-unit saccharides, followed by separation of active tetramers and monomers by size-exclusion gel chromatography (Fig.9 E). The results shown in Fig.11 demonstrate that fibronectin was degraded by monomeric mMCP-6, but not by mMCP-6 in tetrameric form. This study was undertaken to investigate the mechanism and structural requirements in the heparin-induced activation/tetramerization of tryptase. Mature mouse tryptase monomers were obtained by enterokinase digestion of a fusion protein containing mature monomeric mMCP-6 expressed with an N-terminal His6tag followed by an enterokinase site replacing the natural activation peptide. The structural requirements in the activation of tryptase were studied by comparing the potency of heparin and various other structurally related compounds. Both intact heparin chains and heparin in its proteoglycan form were efficient activators. In contrast, heparan sulfate, dermatan sulfate, and chondroitin sulfates (A, C, and E) were not efficient tryptase activators. Since these compounds are all less sulfated than heparin, our results indicate that efficient tryptase activation requires binding of tryptase to highly sulfated compounds. It is interesting to note that, of these latter polysaccharides, only chondroitin sulfate E gave any detectable activation of mMCP-6. Chondroitin sulfate E has a higher sulfate content than both chondroitin sulfates A and C, in agreement with a dependence of tryptase activation on the high anionic charge of its ligand. Dextran sulfate, a synthetic polysaccharide with a high sulfate content, activated tryptase with an even higher efficiency than heparin. Since dextran sulfate has a carbohydrate backbone structure that differs drastically from that of heparin, this finding further supports that the major factor for tryptase activation is anionic charge density rather than more specific structural requirements. This was also supported by experiments with structurally modified heparins in which the N-sulfate, 2-O-sulfate, or 6-O-sulfate groups had been selectively removed. All of these modified heparins were approximately equally effective tryptase activators, suggesting that the interaction of tryptase with heparin is not dependent on sulfate groups at any particular position. Heparin oligosaccharides composed of up to 26 monosaccharides were much less efficient in producing active tryptase than was intact heparin, indicating that tryptase activation is strongly size-dependent regarding heparin chain length. Studies were undertaken to investigate if the ability to activate tryptase is a direct function of tryptase-binding properties. Such experiments showed that oligosaccharides (e.g. 8–10 saccharide units) that were relatively inefficient in producing tryptase activation could bind to tryptase. This raises the possibility that tryptase binding does not necessarily lead to tetramerization and activation. A possible explanation would be that tetramerization requires that at least two monomers are bound alongside the same heparin molecule, whereby heparin thus “bridges” these monomers to facilitate intermolecular contact (Fig. 12). This would explain why heparin oligosaccharides of sufficient size for binding (e.g. 10 saccharide units) are relatively unable to cause efficient tryptase tetramerization. According to such a mechanism, bridging would require that at least two tryptase monomers interact with the same heparin molecule, i.e. forming a ternary complex. If this is the case, tryptase activation would be expected to be most efficient at heparin concentrations that are optimal for promoting formation of ternary complexes between heparin and at least two tryptase monomers. At higher heparin concentrations, there should be a reduced probability that monomers are bound to the same heparin chain since the excess of heparin should favor formation of binary complexes between heparin and solitary tryptase monomers. Indeed, our results illustrate that tryptase activation shows a bell-shaped dose-response curve, with reduced tryptase activation at excess heparin concentrations, in agreement with such a mechanism. It should be noted that similar bell-shaped dose-response curves have been observed in other processes in which heparin acts by bridging two heparin-binding protein molecules, e.g. the acceleration of antithrombin-mediated thrombin inactivation (35Jordan R.E. Oosta G.M. Gardner W.T. Rosenberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 10081-10090Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and chymase-catalyzed thrombin degradation (36Pejler G. Sadler J.E. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 12187-12195Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). When we compared the capability of heparin to bind to and activate tryptase, we observed that, although the binding was saturated at an ∼1:1 molar ratio of heparin to tryptase monomer, tryptase activity continued to increase at higher heparin concentrations. In fact, optimal tryptase activation was seen at a molar ratio of ∼200:1. The explanation for this apparent discrepancy is not certain. One possibility could be that tryptase contains both high and low affinity binding sites for heparin and, if this is the case, that optimal tryptase activation requires binding of heparin to both high and low affinity binding sites. Since the nitrocellulose filter disc assay we used for studying binding of heparin to tryptase involves a washing step, this assay represents a non-equilibrium system. The assay is therefore likely to detect high affinity interactions, whereas loosely bound heparin molecules may detach during the washing step and thus escape detection. In contrast, the equilibrium between heparin and tryptase is not disturbed in the activity assay. This assay should therefore allow detection of both high and low affinity interactions. It is well established that high concentrations of NaCl stabilize human tryptase (22Addington A.K. Johnson D.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13511-13518Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 32Alter S.C. Metcalfe D.D. Bradford T.R. Schwartz L.B. Biochem. J. 1987; 248: 821-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). A likely interpretation for this observation would be that hydrophobic interactions are important in tryptase tetramer stabilization. However, we have shown here that there is an opposite relation between NaCl concentration and ability to form active tryptase. Optimal tryptase activation occurred at NaCl concentrations up to ∼0.14 m, whereas tryptase activation was completely abrogated at NaCl concentrations above ∼0.3 m. Since NaCl would interfere with electrostatic interactions, but strengthen hydrophobic interactions, we conclude that electrostatic interactions are of higher importance than the hydrophobic counterparts during tryptase activation, at least during the initial phases of tetramer assembly. Once heparin has bound to tryptase, it is quite likely that additional hydrophobic interactions between different monomers contribute to stabilizing the tetramer structure, as indicated from the crystal structure of human tryptase (6Pereira P.J. Bergner A. Macedo-Ribeiro S. Huber R. Matschiner G. Fritz H. Sommerhoff C.P. Bode W. Nature. 1998; 392: 306-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). We have shown here, using size-exclusion gel chromatography, that short heparin oligosaccharides (e.g. 10 saccharide units) are capable of producing active tryptase monomers rather than tetramers. Further proof that the compounds present in the monomer position actually corresponded to active monomers (and not to tetramers that had been assembled after the chromatography step) came from inhibition studies in which BPTI was shown to inhibit tryptase in the monomer (but not tetramer) fraction. Resistance to macromolecular protease inhibitors is a classical feature of the mast cell tryptase tetramer (9Alter S.C. Kramps J.A. Janoff A. Schwartz L.B. Arch Biochem. Biophys. 1990; 276: 26-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) and is explained by its molecular organization, where the active sites that are located in the central pore are inaccessible to large protease inhibitors due to steric reasons (6Pereira P.J. Bergner A. Macedo-Ribeiro S. Huber R. Matschiner G. Fritz H. Sommerhoff C.P. Bode W. Nature. 1998; 392: 306-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 7Sommerhoff C.P. Bode W. Pereira P.J.

The access to the active site in an active monomer would obviously be less restricted, which would facilitate interaction with macromolecular protease inhibitors. The inhibition of the tryptase activity that was eluted from the Superdex 200 column in the position of monomers (but not tetramers) thus provides strong evidence that the active material eluting in the monomer fraction corresponds to true active tryptase monomers. Tryptase has been reported to degrade several large proteins,e.g. fibronectin, fibrinogen, and collagen type VI (33Lohi J. Harvima I. Keski-Oja J. J. Cell. Biochem. 1992; 50: 337-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 37Kielty C.M. Lees M. Shuttleworth C.A. Woolley D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 191: 1230-1236Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). However, as discussed in a recent review (8Sommerhoff C.P. Bode W. Matschiner G. Bergner A. Fritz H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1477: 75-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), many of these proteins appear to be too large to fit into the central pore of the tryptase tetramer, thus questioning the relevance of many such findings. We have shown here, in accordance with such a notion, that fibronectin is not a substrate for tetrameric tryptase, but is readily degraded by monomeric active mMCP-6. These findings thus raise the possibility that at least some of the reported activities of tryptase toward macromolecular substrates may be due to small amounts of active monomers that are present in the tryptase preparations. However, the presence of active tryptase monomers in vivo remains to be investigated. Active monomers of human tryptase have been reported previously, although the mechanism for their formation was not studied, and functional differences between tetramers and monomers were not identified (22Addington A.K. Johnson D.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13511-13518Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). To our knowledge, this is the first report in which the existence of tryptase monomers, functionally distinct from the respective tetramers, is demonstrated. The mechanism for the formation of active tryptase monomers apparently involves interaction with heparin, similar to the generation of tetrameric tryptase. The continuous presence of heparin is known to be essential for maintaining the activity of tetrameric tryptase, and interfering with the interaction of tryptase with heparin leads to tetramer dissociation along with enzymatic inactivation (23Hallgren J. Estrada S. Karlson U. Alving K. Pejler G. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 7342-7349Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). A possible explanation for this would be that heparin is needed for bridging the tryptase subunits (see above and Fig. 12 A), although not necessarily affecting the actual active sites. Here we observed that also the monomeric active tryptase is inhibited by heparin antagonists and is thus dependent on the continuous presence of heparin for activity. The exact mechanism by which heparin activates the monomers is not clear, but may involve conformational changes that are induced upon heparin binding. When heparin is dissociated from the active tryptase monomer, its conformation could be distorted, which may lead to loss of enzymatic activity. The formation of active monomers in the presence of short heparin oligosaccharides clearly supports the suggested mechanism for heparin-induced tryptase activation/tetramerization (Fig. 12). Examination of the crystal structure for human β-tryptase revealed that a positively charged patch is present along two neighboring tryptase units in the tetramer and that this patch may accommodate a heparin chain of ∼20 monosaccharides in length (6Pereira P.J. Bergner A. Macedo-Ribeiro S. Huber R. Matschiner G. Fritz H. Sommerhoff C.P. Bode W. Nature. 1998; 392: 306-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Possibly, this chain length corresponds to the minimal size required for the bridging of two tryptase monomers and thus for tetramerization. Accordingly, an oligosaccharide chain length of ∼10 monosaccharide units would be expected to be required for interaction with each tryptase monomer. Oligosaccharides of this size should consequently be able to interact only with one tryptase molecule and would therefore be capable of producing active monomers only (Fig. 12). Our results indicate that 8–10 saccharide units indeed represent the minimal oligosaccharides required for tryptase binding, in close agreement with such a notion. Furthermore, our data indeed indicate that these smaller oligosaccharides are relatively unable to cause tetramerization, but instead preferentially promote formation of active monomers. In summary, we suggest a model for the formation of active tryptase tetramers in which tryptase monomers are bridged by heparin, or similar highly charged polysaccharides, of sufficient chain length (Fig.12).

Little is known on the mechanisms that gate the dislocation channels and determine the directionality of transport across the ER membrane (13Mayer T.U. Braun T. Jentsch S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3251-3257Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 14Mancini R. Fagioli C. Fra A.M. Maggioni C. Sitia R.

An important issue is to what extent substrates must be unfolded to negotiate dislocation. While the Sec61 channel can undergo some lateral expansion (16Menetret J. Neuhof A. Morgan D.G. Plath K. Radermacher M. Rapoport T.A. Akey C.W. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1219-1232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), it is unlikely that large oligomeric proteins can be transported across the ER membrane without perturbing the ionic gradients that exist between the ER lumen and the cytosol. We have chosen immunoglobulins (Igs) as model systems to investigate how the quality control machinery handles oligomeric complexes in which individual subunits have different half-lives. Ig light (L) chains can be secreted also when not paired to heavy (H) chains (17Reddy P. Sparvoli A. Fagioli C. Fassina G. Sitia R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2077-2085Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). In contrast, unassembled H chains are retained in the ER because of the fact that their CH1 domains bind tightly to BiP (18Hendershot L.M. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 829-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Proteasomes are involved in the degradation of unassembled H chains in myeloma cells (14Mancini R. Fagioli C. Fra A.M. Maggioni C. Sitia R. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 769-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 15Chillaron J. Haas I.G. Mol. Biol.

Immunol. 2000; 164: 4713-4719Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). An interesting feature of secretory IgM is that their quality control varies during B cell development, determining the ultimate fate of the molecule (for review, see Ref. 20Reddy P.S. Corley R.B. Immunol. Today. 1999; 20: 582-588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). IgM is secreted by plasma cells only as pentamers containing a J chain or hexamers (20Reddy P.S. Corley R.B. Immunol. Today. 1999; 20: 582-588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). This is due to the fact that the carboxyl-terminal cysteine of secretory µ (µs) chains (Cys-575) serves as a three-way switch mediating the assembly, retention, and degradation of unpolymerized IgM subunits (21Sitia R. Neuberger M. Alberini C. Bet P. Fra A. Valetti C. Williams G. Milstein C. Cell. 1990; 60: 781-790Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 22Fra A.M. Fagioli C. Finazzi D. Sitia R.

Immunol. 1994; 24: 2477-2482Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). For reasons that are still unclear, IgM polymerization is inefficient in B cells (24Carelli S. Ceriotti A. Sitia R. Eur. J. Immunol. 1997; 27: 1283-1291Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Therefore, most µs chains are retained and eventually degraded despite assembling with L chains to form µs2·L2complexes (25Sidman C. Cell. 1981; 23: 379-389Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 26Rabinovich E. Bar-Nun S. Amitay R. Shachar I. Gur B. Taya M. Haimovich J. J. Biol.

In contrast, analogous complexes containing membrane µ chains (µm2·L2) negotiate assembly with signaling components (Ig-α and Ig-β) and are transported to the cell surface of B lymphocytes (29Neuberger M.S.

Trends Immunol. 2001; 22: 356-360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) where they act as antigen receptors. Because of the intrinsic complexity of IgM intracellular traffic in B cells and the unavailability of antibodies efficiently discriminating µm and µs, we decided to first investigate the handling of covalent complexes containing subunits with different half-lives in a simpler model system. Suitably engineered Ig H and L chains were thus expressed in myeloma cells lacking endogenous Igs. A chimeric µ chain carboxyl-terminally extended with the transmembrane region of the T cell receptor α chain (µ-TCRα) was selected because it is degraded by proteasomes even when assembled with λ light chains (22Fra A.M. Fagioli C. Finazzi D. Sitia R. Alberini C.M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4755-4761Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Since normal and malignant plasma cells synthesize L chains in excess, it has been difficult to analyze the fate of λ chains that partner up with short-lived µ-TCRα in J558L cells. To circumvent this problem, we generated myeloma transfectants expressing more µ-TCRα than λ chains. In this line, almost all “innocent” λ chains are assembled with short-lived µ. Our results demonstrate that covalent H·L and H2·L2 complexes are dissociated prior to the dislocation of µ-TCRα chains to the cytosol. Most freed λ chains reassemble with µ-TCRα, and only a few are secreted. Secretory IgM in B cells shares a similar fate. These results suggest that interchain disulfide bonds are reduced in a site from which short- and long-lived subunits can be efficiently sorted. The former proceed to dislocation, while the latter are reinserted into the assembly line or exported to the Golgi to be secreted. NSO myeloma cells were stably transfected as described previously (8Fagioli C. Sitia R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12885-12892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 22Fra A.M. Fagioli C. Finazzi D. Sitia R. Alberini C.M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4755-4761Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) with plasmids driving the expression of µ-TCRα. The entire murine λ1 light chain coding sequence was excised from pREP10λ1 (20Reddy P.S. Corley R.B. Immunol. Today. 1999; 20: 582-588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and inserted into pCDNA3.1A. Transfectants were selected on hygromycin. Upon assembly, µ-TCRα and λ chains generate binding sites specific for the hapten NP (22Fra A.M. Fagioli C. Finazzi D. Sitia R. Alberini C.M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4755-4761Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 31Valetti C. Grossi C.E. Milstein C. Sitia R. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 983-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The B lymphoma WEHI-231 or its variant WEHI-231-J3E5 (28Brewer, J. W., and Corley, R. B. (1997) Mol. Immunol. 323–31.Google Scholar) expressing murine J chains (W.231-J) were kind gifts of Dr. Ron Corley (Boston University). Transfectants were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium or RPMI medium supplemented with the appropriate selection drug as described previously (14Mancini R. Fagioli C. Fra A.M. Maggioni C. Sitia R. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 769-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 22Fra A.M. Fagioli C. Finazzi D. Sitia R. Alberini C.M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4755-4761Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The antibodies and reagents used have been described previously (8Fagioli C. Sitia R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12885-12892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Pulse-chase assays, immunoprecipitations, and Western blotting were performed as described previously (8Fagioli C. Sitia R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12885-12892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 22Fra A.M. Fagioli C. Finazzi D. Sitia R. Alberini C.M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4755-4761Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). For sequential immunoprecipitation, samples were first incubated with either rabbit anti-mouse µ antibodies followed by protein A-Sepharose or NP-Sepharose. Immunoprecipitation was repeated once with the first reagent to ensure complete capture of the reactive proteins. The supernatants were then incubated with the second reagent (anti-L or anti-µ, respectively). Protein G-Sepharose beads were used with goat anti-λ. Immunoprecipitates were treated with or without endoglycosidase H (Endo H, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) or PNGase F (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) as recommended by the suppliers. Fluorograms were scanned, and the relevant bands were quantified by the ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Assembly of H with L chains normally results in Ig secretion (Ref. 20Reddy P.S. Corley R.B. Immunol. Today. 1999; 20: 582-588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar and references therein). However, chimeric µ chains extended with the transmembrane region of the TCRα chain, which contains a dominant ER-associated degradation targeting signal (32Bonifacino J.S. Suzuki C.K. Klausner R.D. Science. 1990; 247: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), are rapidly degraded even when covalently assembled with λ (Refs. 8Fagioli C. Sitia R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12885-12892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar and 22Fra A.M. Fagioli C. Finazzi D. Sitia R. Alberini C.M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4755-4761Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar and see below). To analyze the fate of transport-competent λ chains that form covalent complexes with these short-lived chimeric µ chains, we generated NSO transfectants expressing µ-TCRα, λ, or both chains in different amounts (Fig. 1). A clone producing µ-TCRα in excess (N[µ>λ], Fig. 1, lane 1) was selected. In these cells, bands corresponding to monomeric and dimeric µ-TCRα but very few free λ chains were detectable under nonreducing conditions (Fig. 1, lane 5). Most λ chains are part of covalent µ-TCRα·λ and µ-TCRα2·λ2 complexes. While unassembled µ-TCRα chains were not secreted (Fig. 2, lanes 1–3), about half of the λ chains synthesized during a 5-min pulse could be detected after 4 h of chase in the supernatants of NSO transfectants lacking H chains (Fig. 2, λ, lanes 4–6). The synthesis of µ-TCRα chains dramatically reduced λ secretion by the N[µ>λ] transfectant (Fig. 2, lanes 7–9), and less than 10% of λ were detected extracellularly at the end of the chase. Also in these cells, µ-TCRα chains were not secreted (Fig.2, lane 9). However, while µ-TCRα was extensively degraded, the majority of λ chains was recovered in the lysates of cells chased for 4 h (Fig. 2, lane 8). Thus, although in this transfectant most λ chains are covalently assembled with µ-TCRα (see Fig. 1), the two subunits appeared to have different fates. More detailed pulse-chase assays were performed to investigate the fate of individual Ig subunits in NSO[µ>λ] cells (Fig. 3). Lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-µ antibodies to capture all µ-TCRα and the fraction of λ chains associated to them (Fig. 3A). After a lag, µ-TCRα chains were degraded. On the contrary, the intensity of the λ chain band increased during the initial chase period, reflecting progressive assembly of newly synthesized λ with µ-TCRα, and remained almost constant later in the chase when the degradation of radioactive µ-TCRα became evident (Fig. 3,A and B). Analysis of the samples under nonreducing conditions (not shown) confirmed that assembly between λ and µ-TCRα was stabilized by interchain disulfide bonds (Fig. 1). These results suggested that λ chains that were initially disulfide-bonded to radioactive µ-TCRα reassociated with cold µ-TCRα chains synthesized during the chase, implying that interchain disulfide bonds are continuously reduced and reformed in the ER. We have previously shown that the degradation of two transport-incompetent µ chains, µm and µΔCH1, is slower in J558L (which produces λ chains in excess) than in NSO cells (31Valetti C. Grossi C.E. Milstein C. Sitia R. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 983-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 33Sitia R. Neuberger M.S. Milstein C. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 3969-3977Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), suggesting that assembly with L chains can protect H chains from degradation. The N[µ>λ] transfectant synthesizing λ chains in defect allowed us to compare the fate of free and assembled µ-TCRα chains in the same cell. To this end, lysates of pulse-chased cells were first incubated with NP-Sepharose beads, which bind only properly assembled VH-VL (31Valetti C. Grossi C.E. Milstein C. Sitia R. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 983-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The leftovers were then incubated with anti-µ antibodies to precipitate unassembled µ-TCRα chains. As described above for λ chains (Fig.3A), the fraction of radioactive µ chains precipitating with NP-Sepharose increased in the first chase point, reflecting assembly of newly made H chains into hapten-binding complexes (Fig.3C, upper panel). After 1 h of chase, equal amounts of radioactive µ-TCRα chains were present in the assembled and free pools (Fig. 3C, lane 3). During further chase, the intensity of the NP-precipitable band decreased more slowly, suggesting that assembly with λ retarded their degradation (Fig.3D). Next we asked whether the reduction of interchain disulfide bonds in the ER lumen is coupled to dislocation. We have previously shown that the dislocation of unassembled µschains is coupled to degradation (14Mancini R. Fagioli C. Fra A.M. Maggioni C. Sitia R. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 769-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Likewise, µ-TCRα chains were found in the microsomal pellet after incubation with proteasome inhibitors (Fig. 4A) when deglycosylated J chains were detectable in the cytosol (14Mancini R. Fagioli C. Fra A.M. Maggioni C. Sitia R. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 769-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Therefore, although the degradation of µ-TCRα chains is insensitive to ER mannosidase I inhibitors (8Fagioli C. Sitia R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12885-12892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) their dislocation requires active proteasomes. As expected (8Fagioli C. Sitia R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12885-12892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), proteasome inhibitors prevented the degradation of µ-TCRα chains in N[µ>λ] cells (Fig. 4B, comparelanes 2 and 3 in the top panel). Some λ chains were stabilized as well (Fig. 4B, middle panel) but to a much smaller extent than µ-TCRα. The stabilization was observed also in cells expressing only λ chains (Fig. 4B, bottom panel), suggesting that some unassembled wild type λ chains are degraded by proteasomes (17Reddy P. Sparvoli A. Fagioli C. Fassina G. Sitia R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2077-2085Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 34Gardner A.M. Aviel S. Argon Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25940-25947Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,35O'Hare T. Wiens G.D. Whitcomb E.A. Enns C.A. Rittenberg M.B. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 11-14PubMed Google Scholar). The increase in the intracellular λ pool was not due to inhibition of secretion by ZL3H since similar amounts of λ could be recovered in the supernatants (not shown). It is noteworthy that, when the dislocation of µ-TCRα was prevented by blocking proteasome activity, the amount of unassembled λ did not increase significantly and covalent µ-TCRα2·λ2 complexes accumulated (Fig.4C, lanes 3 and 6). Taken together, these findings suggested that the reduction of the interchain disulfide bonds is coupled with dislocation. Having shown that L chains are dissociated in the ER lumen prior to the dislocation of µ-TCRα chains in myeloma transfectants, we analyzed whether this mechanism is important also in B lymphocytes. These cells retain most µs chains in the ER but express µm chains on the surface as antigen receptors (21Sitia R. Neuberger M. Alberini C. Bet P. Fra A. Valetti C. Williams G. Milstein C. Cell. 1990; 60: 781-790Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 25Sidman C. Cell. 1981; 23: 379-389Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar,29Neuberger M.S.

The differential trafficking of µm or µscan be studied in W.231-J B lymphoma cells, which produce similar amounts of the two isoforms (Fig. 5). Despite µm being 22 residues longer than µs(36Kehry M. Ewald S. Douglas R. Sibley C. Raschke W. Fambrough D. Hood L. Cell. 1980; 21: 393-406Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), the presence of an additional N-glycan in the µs carboxyl-terminal tailpiece makes it difficult to distinguish the two chains electrophoretically (Fig. 5A,lane 1). To allow unambiguous identification of µm and µs, samples were thus treated with PNGase F, an enzyme that removes all N-glycans irrespective from their processing state. Following glycan cleavage, µm and µs migrated as a doublet with µs being the fastest species (Fig. 5A,lane 2). Most µs chains were degraded during a 4-h chase (Fig. 5A, lanes 5–6). Degradation was inhibited by ZL3H (Fig. 5A, lanes 7–8), indicating the involvement of proteasomes in the disposal of µs chains. W.231-J cells secrete small amounts of µs (28Brewer, J. W., and Corley, R. B. (1997) Mol. Immunol. 323–31.Google Scholar). Proteasome inhibitors did not significantly affect IgM secretion. Lactacystin, ZL3H, andN-acetyl-Leu-Leu-norleucinal prevented µs degradation in other cell lines such as I.29 µ+ (Ref. 21Sitia R. Neuberger M. Alberini C. Bet P. Fra A. Valetti C. Williams G. Milstein C. Cell. 1990; 60: 781-790Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar and data not shown) or 38.C (26Rabinovich E. Bar-Nun S. Amitay R. Shachar I. Gur B. Taya M. Haimovich J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24145-24148Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), 2J. Haimovich and E. Rabinovich, personal communication. confirming that proteasomes are responsible for the degradation of secretory IgM in B lymphomas. To investigate whether N-glycan processing is important for timing the degradation of µs chains also in B lymphoma cells, W.231-J cells were chased in the presence of kifunensine, a specific inhibitor of ER mannosidase I (8Fagioli C. Sitia R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12885-12892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.5B, kifunensine was almost as effective as ZL3H in preventing the degradation of µs chains. In agreement with the notion that IgM quality control occurs in a pre-Golgi compartment (20Reddy P.S. Corley R.B. Immunol. Today. 1999; 20: 582-588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 37Valetti C. Sitia R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 1311-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) treatment with proteasome inhibitors induced the accumulation of Endo H-sensitive chains (Fig.5C, compare lanes 4 and 6). It is not easy to establish the relative amounts of µm and µs present in this band; however, the results obtained with PNGase F suggest that µs predominated. Mature µm chains were easily detectable after 4 h of chase as an Endo H-resistant band of about 82 kDa (Fig. 5, A–C,tailed arrows). The abundance of this species was not altered by proteasome inhibitors (Fig. 5, A, lanes 5 and 7; B, lanes 2 and3; and C, lanes 3–6). However, we often detected more µm in cells chased with proteasome inhibitors, indicating that some µm are degraded by proteasomes as well probably due to their inefficient assembly with Ig-α and/or Ig-β. Electrophoresis under nonreducing conditions (Fig. 5C, lanes 7–9) revealed that, while some free µ chains were detectable at the end of a 5-min pulse, both µm and µs were associated covalently with K chains at the end of the chase. The presence of proteasome inhibitors induced the accumulation of a band of about 200 kDa, likely consisting of µs2·L2 complexes. Some high molecular weight aggregates were also seen (Fig. 5C,arrows). Noteworthy is that the intensity of the K chain band was only slightly increased in cells treated with proteasome inhibitors (Fig.5C, compare lanes 3–6). This observation suggested that, like in the NSO transfectants, radioactive K chains that were part of covalent complexes with short-lived µschains were dissociated and recycled also in B cells. To confirm this, the anti-µ immunoprecipitates from a pulse-chase assay were resolved under reducing conditions, and the intensity of µ and K chain bands was quantified by densitometry (Fig. 5D). Clearly, radioactive K chains appeared to be more stable than Endo H-sensitive µs chains. Western blot and immunoprecipitation assays (not shown) confirmed that in W.231-J cells used in these studies the vast majority of K chains was covalently assembled to µ chains. Translocating a polypeptide across a membrane without perturbing ionic gradients is a formidable task for living cells. It has been clearly established that proteins must be unfolded to penetrate mitochondrial membrane (38Schatz G. Dobberstein B. Science. 1996; 271: 1519-1526Crossref PubMed Scopus (922) Google Scholar). Similarly the posttranslational entry of polypeptides into the ER of yeast cells requires unfolding (39Rapoport T.A. Matlack K.E. Plath K. Misselwitz B. Staeck O. Biol. Chem. 1999; 380: 1143-1150Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). So far little is known about whether, and to what extent, unfolding is necessary for luminal proteins to be dislocated across the ER membrane for proteasomal destruction. We have exploited Ig subunits with different half-lives to determine whether disulfide bonds are reduced in the ER lumen before dislocation. In the two experimental systems used, nonsecreting B cell lymphomas and suitably engineered myeloma transfectants, transport-competent L chains assemble covalently with short-lived µ chains. Our results allow the following main conclusions to be drawn. First, in B lymphoma cells µs chains are degraded by cytosolic proteasomes. Second, H-L interchain disulfide bonds are reduced prior to the dislocation of short-lived µ chains. Third, most released L chains reassemble with newly made µ chains, while some are secreted. Thus, covalent interactions with doomed µ chains cause retention but not destruction of otherwise transport-competent L chains. Because of the inefficiency of IgM polymerization in B cells, the µsCys-575 residues exert their function mainly as a retention and degradation targeting element (22Fra A.M. Fagioli C. Finazzi D. Sitia R. Alberini C.M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4755-4761Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). As a result, µsL “hemimers” and µs2L2 “monomers” accumulate in the ER and are eventually degraded. The observation that lactacystin, ZL3H, carboxybenzyl-Leu-Leu-Leu-vinylsulfone, andN-acetyl-Leu-Leu-norleucinal (40Bogyo M. McMaster J.S. Gaczynska M. Tortorella D. Goldberg A.L. Ploegh H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6629-6634Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar) prevent the degradation of µs chains indicates the involvement of cytosolic proteasomes. µs chains are degraded also in a W.231 transfectant expressing J chains. Few IgM pentamers and hexamers are secreted by these cells (28Brewer, J. W., and Corley, R. B. (1997) Mol. Immunol. 323–31.Google Scholar) 3C. Fagioli, A. Mezghrani, and R. Sitia, unpublished observations. confirming that, while allowing the production of pentamers, the synthesis of J chains is not sufficient to initiate efficient IgM polymerization (20Reddy P.S. Corley R.B. Immunol. Today. 1999; 20: 582-588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Also some µm chains are degraded by proteasomes, probably reflecting inefficient assembly with Ig-α and Ig-β. Deglycosylated J chains become clearly detectable when proteasomes are inhibited, implying that a few J chains are dislocated to be processed by cytosolic N-glycanases (Ref. 14Mancini R. Fagioli C. Fra A.M. Maggioni C. Sitia R. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 769-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar and references therein). In contrast, deglycosylated µs chains are not detectable under the same conditions, suggesting that as myeloma cells degradation and dislocation are coupled events. As described previously for unassembled µs and µm chains in myeloma cells (8Fagioli C. Sitia R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12885-12892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), kifunensine inhibited µs degradation in W231-J cells indicating thatN-glycan processing is important for timing IgM quality control also in B lymphomas. During the time allocated before expulsion from the ER, both µm and µs fold and assemble with L chains, forming intra- and interchain disulfide bonds. Once the µsN-glycans undergo processing by kifunensine-sensitive mannosidases, the µspresent in monomers and hemimers are targeted for dislocation. How are these covalent complexes handled? Our findings indicate that the interchain disulfide bonds that link L chains to short-lived H chains are reduced prior to the dislocation of the latter, that is in the ER lumen. In myeloma cells engineered to produce short-lived µ-TCRα chains in excess, most λ are assembled covalently to µ-TCRα. Yet λ chains are stable, implying that they are dissociated from µ-TCRα before these are degraded by proteasomes. Our pulse-chase assays indicate that dissociation occurs before, and seems to be coupled to, the dislocation step. The majority of freed λ chains reassemble with cold µ-TCRα chains synthesized during the chase. Thus, the dissociation of H and L chains occurs in a site from which released L chains can rapidly gain access to the assembly line. Only a few L chains can escape this Sisyphean effort to make antibodies with the wrong partner chain and are secreted (Fig.6). The ER seems to be the best candidate to host this chain of events. However, it is also possible that the H-L dissociation that precedes µ dislocation occurs, at least in part, in the intermediate compartment, which has been shown to contain some Sec61 channels (41Kamhi-Nesher S. Shenkman M. Tolchinsky S. Fromm S.V. Ehrlich R. Lederkremer G.Z. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1711-1723Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). L chains released in the ER-to-Golgi intermediate compartment might be secreted. The results shown in Fig. 5 suggest that L chains are sorted from short-lived µs chains and recycled also in B lymphoma cells. In agreement with previous findings in both myeloma and B lymphoma transfectants (26Rabinovich E. Bar-Nun S. Amitay R. Shachar I. Gur B. Taya M. Haimovich J. J. Biol.

In the “tug of war” model of protein dislocation across the ER membrane (14Mancini R. Fagioli C. Fra A.M. Maggioni C. Sitia R. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 769-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), L chains can be viewed as additional players in the luminal team. H-L assembly would thus compete with the dislocation machinery. Blocking proteasomal activity caused the accumulation of covalent µ-TCRα2·λ2 complexes, suggesting that reduction of interchain disulfide bonds and H-L dissociation are coupled to dislocation (Fig. 4). The fact that H-L disassembly requires energy might explain why the degradation of assembled µswas facilitated by cytosolic factors and reducing agents to a greater extent than free µ chains (26Rabinovich E.

Our data do not allow us to establish whether also intrachain disulfides are reduced before dislocation of Ig subunits as suggested for major histocompatibility complex class I heavy chains (42Tortorella D.

It is generally accepted that the redox conditions in the ER are more oxidizing than those in the cytosol (3Bader M. Winther J.R. Bardwell J.C. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: E57-E58Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 4Frand A.R. Cuozzo J.W. Kaiser C.A.

Science. 1992; 257: 1496-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (1608) Google Scholar). The observation that interchain disulfide bonds are reduced before dislocation of short-lived µ chains implies that molecules endowed with reductase activity be present in the vicinity of active dislocons. The identity of these molecules and the mechanisms that maintain them in the reduced state within the oxidizing milieu of the ER are unknown. Reduced protein disulfide isomerase has been recently shown capable of dissociating cholera toxin, releasing A chains that can parasitize the ER-associated degradation dislocation pathways to reach their targets in the cytosol (44Tsai B. Rodighiero C. Lencer W.I. Rapoport T.A. Cell. 2001; 104: 937-948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). As oxidized protein disulfide isomerase is known to bind nascent proteins to facilitate disulfide bond formation (45Molinari M. Helenius A. Nature. 1999; 402: 90-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar), 4Mezghrani, A., Fassio, A., Benham, A., Simmen, T., Braakman, I., and Sitia, R. (2001) EMBO J., in press. the question arises of if and how reduced protein disulfide isomerase can be generated in the vicinity of active dislocons. In mammalian cells, Ero1-L α and β oxidize protein disulfide isomerase4 and may therefore play a key role in controlling the balance between formation and reduction of disulfide bonds in the ER. It is also possible that other ER oxidoreductases, such as ERp72, ERp57, or p5, whose redox state does not seem to depend on the activity of Ero1-L α and β4are involved in breaking the H-L interchain bonds for µ chain degradation. Whatever the molecular mechanism involved, our data imply that the redox state in the ER must be specifically and precisely controlled to allow the concomitant formation and reduction of disulfide bonds within the same compartment (3Bader M. Winther J.R. Bardwell J.C. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: E57-E58Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 4Frand A.R. Cuozzo J.W. Kaiser C.A.

In this process, a reductive dehalogenase (CprA), couples the oxidation of an electron donor to the reductive elimination of chloride. We have characterized the B12 and iron-sulfur cluster-containing 3-chloro-4-hydroxybenzoate reductive dehalogenase from Desulfitobacterium chlororespirans.

The carboxyl group can be replaced by other functionalities, e.g. acetyl or halide groups, ortho or meta to the chloride to be eliminated. The purified D. chlororespirans enzyme could dechlorinate an hydroxylated PCB (3,3′,5,5′-tetrachloro-4,4′-biphenyldiol) at a rate about 1% of that with 3-chloro-4-hydroxybenzoate.

Eleven of the twelve targeted compounds are chlorinated organic compounds. A U.S. Environmental Protection Agency list of its 12 priority Persistent, Bioaccumulative, and Toxic pollutants includes nine chlorinated organics, five of which are chlorinated aromatics. Bioremediation represents one possible strategy for removing these environmental toxins. A variety of microbes can catalyze the removal of the halogen substituent (1Copley S.D. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1998; 2: 613-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 2Holliger C. Wohlfarth G. Diekert G. FEMS Rev. 1999; 22: 383-398Crossref Google Scholar). These organisms and the dehalogenation reactions they catalyze are interesting from the standpoint of biochemistry, genetics, and biotechnological applications. Dehalogenation reactions are also intriguing from an evolutionary perspective since chlorinated xenobiotics were introduced within the last century. There are at least three distinct enzyme classes that can remove the halogen substituent from organic compounds: the hydrolases, the methyltransferases, and the reductive dehalogenases. In this report we focus on an enzyme in the reductive dehalogenase class. The hydrolytic dehalogenases, which replace the chloro group with an hydroxyl functionality, are by far the best studied. Hallmarks of this enzyme class are the use of an aspartate residue as a nucleophile to form a covalent enzyme-substrate adduct and a general base residue to facilitate the hydrolysis step. High resolution structures are available for the 4-chlorobenzoyl-CoA (3Benning M.M. Taylor K.L. Liu R.Q. Yang G. Xiang H. Wesenberg G. Dunaway-Mariano D. Holden H.M.

The methyltransferase class uses vitamin B12 as a cofactor in a group transfer reaction (6Meβmer M. Reinhardt S. Wohlfarth G. Diekert G. Arch. Microbiol. 1996; 165: 18-25Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The reductive dehalogenases replace the chloro functionality with a hydride equivalent. Two types of reductive dehalogenases include dehalorespiration-linked metalloenzymes that couple the reduction of the chlorinated hydrocarbons to ATP synthesis via a chemiosmotic mechanism (2Holliger C. Wohlfarth G. Diekert G. FEMS Rev. 1999; 22: 383-398Crossref Google Scholar, 7Wohlfarth G. Diekert G. Curr. Opin.

Leisinger T. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 164-171Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This report focuses on a dehalorespiration-linked reductive dehalogenase. Members of the dehalorespiratory class of reductive dehalogenases have several interesting features. Enzymes have been described that can dehalogenate a discrete set of aliphatic and aromatic compounds. Perhaps the most interesting and potentially important reactions are the microbial reductive dechlorination of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs)1 and their oxygenated metabolites, the hydroxylated PCBs (OH-PCBs), by anaerobes (9Quensen J.F. Boyd S.A. Tiedje J.M. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1990; 56: 2360Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Morris P.J. Mohn W.W. Quensen J.F. d. Tiedje J.M. Boyd S.A. Appl. Environ.

Microbiol. 1999; 65: 2217-2221Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Microbes have been isolated from contaminated soils and sediments that can catalyze removal of meta, para, and orthochlorines of PCB mixtures by reductive dehalogenation (12Wiegel J. Wu Q.Z. FEMS Microbiol. Ecol. 2000; 32: 1-15Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, some microbes have evolved the capacity to gain energy from the reductive dehalogenation reaction (13Dolfing J. Tiedje J.M. Arch. Microbiol. 1987; 149: 102-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 14Mohn W.W. Tiedje J.M. Arch. Microbiol. 1991; 157: 1-6Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar). For example,Dehalospirillum multivorans generates a membrane potential and/or a pH gradient associated with the transfer of electrons from the electron donor (H2 or pyruvate) to the chlorinated organic (15Miller E. Wohlfarth G. Diekert G. Arch. Microbiol. 1997; 166: 379-387Crossref Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In all but one case, the enzymes, encoded by the cprAgene, that catalyze the reductive dehalogenation are vitamin B12- (or cobamide-) and iron-sulfur-containing enzymes. In at least some desulfitobacteria, the cprA gene is found within a cluster of genes that includes a membrane anchor (CprB), a membrane-associated regulatory protein (CprC), a DNA binding protein (CprK), and several chaperones (CprT, CprD, and CprB) (16Smidt H. van Leest M. vander Oost J. de Vos W.M. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 5683-5691Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In this report we will typically refer to the dehalogenase as CprA. Two general mechanisms have been proposed for the dehalorespiring reductive dehalogenases (modified from Ref. 2Holliger C. Wohlfarth G. Diekert G. FEMS Rev. 1999; 22: 383-398Crossref Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1). In one (shown as path A), an organocobalt adduct is formed as in the methyltransferases; whereas, in the other (path B), the corrinoid serves as an electron donor. In path A, the halide is eliminated as the aryl-Co(III) intermediate is formed. Path B resembles the Birch reduction of hydroxylated aromatics in which a radical anion is formed. Because the chlorine is the most electron-withdrawing substituent on the ring, the carbon to which it is bonded would bear the highest charge density in the radical anion. This position, therefore, would be most activated toward protonation, assuming that the proton transfer occurs before or concerted with chloride elimination, as shown in theupper transition state diagram in Fig.1. Yet one could imagine proton addition from solvent occurring after chloride departure, as in the lower transition state structure. Because dehalorespiring bacteria were discovered only recently, many questions about the dehalogenation mechanism remain unanswered. Are organocobalt adducts analogous to those in B12-dependent methyltransferases formed during the reaction mechanism? How is the chlorine replaced by a hydride equivalent? Does the reaction involve radical intermediates? What are the structural requirements for the substrate of the dehalogenase reaction? Here we describe studies focused mainly on characterizing the substrate specificity and mechanism of the aromatic dehalogenase fromDesulfitobacterium chlororespirans, an organism that was enriched and isolated based on its ability to grow on 3-chloro-4-hydroxybenzoate (17Sanford R. Cole J. Loffler F. Tiedje J. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1996; 62: 3800-3808Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These studies are important in understanding the dehalogenation mechanism and in developing strategies for bioremediation of sites contaminated with chlorinated aromatics, like PCBs. D. chlororespirans (ATCC 700175) was grown with agitation on reduced anaerobic medium (ATCC 2035), containing 20 mm pyruvate, 2 mm 3-chloro-4-hydroxybenzoate, and 1 g of yeast extract per liter (17Sanford R. Cole J. Loffler F. Tiedje J. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1996; 62: 3800-3808Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The 13-liter cultures were incubated in a 14-liter fermentor at 37 °C for 4 days using an 80% N2/20% CO2 headspace gas. Addition of 20 mm pyruvate and 2 mm 3-chloro-4-hydroxybenzoate on the second day of incubation increased the optical density at 600 nm (A600) to 0.7–0.8. D. chlororespirans cells were harvested with a continuous flow CEPA centrifuge at 16,000 × g, yielding 1.4 g/liter wet weight of cells, which were stored at −80 °C. 14.6 g of cells was suspended in 35 ml of buffer A (100 mm potassium Pi, pH 7.2, 2 mm dithiothreitol) plus 40 units/ml DNase I and sonicated (30 min, 30 s pulse on, 30 s pulse off) under anaerobic conditions (95% N2/5% H2). The cell-free extract was separated into a membrane fraction and a soluble fraction by centrifugation for 4 h at 105,000 × g and 4 °C. The membrane fraction was resuspended in 20 ml of buffer A supplemented with 3% (w/v) Triton X-100 and 20% glycerol and incubated at 4 °C for 2 h under anaerobic conditions. The insoluble fraction was removed from this preparation by centrifugation for 2 h at 105,000 × g and 4 °C. The supernatant contained CprA, which was further processed. All chromatographic steps were performed in an anaerobic chamber with a N2/H2 (95%/5%) gas phase. The membrane fraction was diluted with an equal volume of buffer B (50 mm potassium Pi, 0.1% Triton X-100, 20% glycerol, and 2 mm dithiothreitol) at pH 6.2 and loaded on a 5 × 7 cm Q-Sepharose column (Bio-Rad) equilibrated with the same buffer. The column was eluted with a 600-ml linear gradient from 0 to 500 mm NaCl in buffer B at a flow of 3 ml/min. Fractions containing the highest dechlorination activity were pooled and diluted with an equal volume of buffer B (same as buffer A, but at pH 8.0) and applied to a High Q-Sepharose column (2.5 × 7 cm) (Bio-Rad) equilibrated with buffer B. The enzyme was eluted with a 120-ml linear gradient from 0 to 500 mm NaCl in buffer B at a flow rate of 1.3 ml/min. Fractions containing dehalogenase activity were pooled and mixed with an equal volume of buffer B, pH 8.0, and applied to a High Q-Sepharose column (Econo-Pac cartridges, 5 ml) (Bio-Rad) equilibrated with the same buffer. The enzyme was eluted with a 60-ml linear gradient from 0 to 600 mm NaCl in buffer B at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The protein concentration was determined according to Bradford (18Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (215560) Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. The pH and temperature optima were determined in buffer B at pH values ranging from 5.1 to 8.7 and temperatures from 25 to 70 °C. Dehalogenase activity in every fraction was assayed by TLC, as described below. Dehalogenase activity in the combined fractions after each step of purification was estimated spectrophotometrically, as described below. The assay mixture, which contained 0.3 ml of buffer B (pH 7.6), 40 µl of 15 mm methyl viologen, 50 µl of 0.2m titanium citrate, 10 µl of 50 mm3-chloro-4-hydroxybenzoate, and 10–100 µl of sample, was anaerobically incubated for 30 min at 57 °C and then quenched by adding 50 µl of 0.2 m perchloric acid and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 1 min. The clear supernatant was extracted with 0.5 ml of diethyl ether, and the organic phase was spotted on Silica Gel AL SIL G/UV plates (Whatman Ltd.). The mobile phase consisted of toluene:acetic acid:water (6:7:3, v/v). The separated products were visualized by use of a UV lamp and identified by their relative mobility (Rf) values, which are 0.46 and 0.32 for 3-chloro-4-hydroxybenzoate and 4-hydroxybenzoate, respectively. Dehalogenation of 3-chloro-4-hydroxybenzoate and other chlorinated substrates was measured spectrophotometrically at 578 nm and 37 °C by following the oxidation of reduced methyl viologen (ε578 = 9.7 mm−1cm−1) (19Schumacher W. Holliger C. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 2328-2333Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The 0.5-ml assay mixture contained 0.5 mm chlorinated compound and 0.3 mm methyl viologen in buffer B at pH 7.6. The methyl viologen was reduced by adding titanium(III) citrate until the absorbance at 578 nm reached 2.6. The linearity of the absorbance value to 2.6 OD units at 578 nm was confirmed. The reaction was initiated by adding 5–50 µl of dehalogenase (the final enzyme concentration was 20–150 nm). One unit of activity is defined as the amount of enzyme that catalyzes the reduction of 1 µmol of chlorinated substrate, which equals the oxidation of 2 µmol of reduced methyl viologen, per minute. Steady-state kinetic parameters were determined from plots of the initial rates of dehalogenation versussubstrate concentration (5 µm to 10 mm), which were fit to the Michaelis-Menten equation using SigmaPlot. The inhibition constant (Ki) was determined by fitting experimental data to the following equation: v =Vmax*S/(S +Km*(1 + i/Ki)), whereVmax and Km correspond to the parameters for 3-chloro-4-hydroxybenzoate dechlorination without inhibitor, and i stands for inhibitor concentration. In studies of the dehalogenation of hydroxy-PCBs, the 0.5-ml assay mixture contained 20 mm titanium(III) citrate, 0.6 mm3,3′,5,5′-tetrachloro-4,4′-biphenyldiol, and 22–28 µg/ml dehalogenase in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.6. After incubating at 57 °C for various times, the reaction was quenched by exposing to air and extracting with dichloromethane. The organic phase was analyzed for the parent compound (3,3′,5,5′-tetrachloro-4,4′-biphenyldiol) and dechlorination products by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Injections (1 µl) were made in the splitless mode on a Varian 3400CX GC coupled to a Saturn 3 ion trap mass spectrometer using an 8200 Autosampler and helium as the carrier gas. A fused silica GC column (30 ml × 0.25 mm i.d.) coated with 0.25-µm DB-XLB (Agilent Technologies/J&W Scientific Division, Folsom, CA) was used to separate compounds of interest. The GC was programmed as follows: 70 °C (2-min hold); ramp to 280 °C at 6 °C/min (3-min hold); total run time of 40 min. The injector was initially held at 70 °C and then ramped ballistically to 280 °C at 200 °C/min. The MS transfer line and manifold temperature were held isothermal at 280 °C and 240 °C, respectively. The ion trap was operated in the electron impact full scan mode (m/z 50–350) at 1.0 cycles/s and was turned on 8 min after sample injection. Repeated injections of a 100 µg/ml solution of the parent 3,3′,5,5′-tetrachloro-4,4′-biphenyldiol (m/z 223, 322, 324) were made to determine the electron impact mass spectrum and to assess the response and the change in GC-MS sensitivity, if any, through the analytical run. No variability in relative response and/or mass spectra of parent/daughter compounds was observed. Two additional GC peaks that appeared to be related to the parent compound were detectable in all extracts, including a trichloro-biphenyldiol (m/z 189, 288, 290) and a dichloro-biphenylol (m/z 139, 238, 240). The relative abundances and molar concentrations of these dichloro- to tetrachloro- compounds were estimated assuming a uniform MS response equal to that determined for the parent compound and the appropriate molecular masses. The purity of the parent 3,3′,5,5′-tetrachloro-4,4′-biphenyldiol was reported by the supplier to be 95%. We estimated the purity at 92%, with as much as 7% trichloro-biphenyldiol as impurity. Less than 1% of the dichloro-biphenyl-ol and no dichloro-biphenyldiol was found in the original solution. The mean relative amounts of the parent/dechlorination products were 50%/50% for incubations containing the dehalogenase compared with 77%/23% for duplicate control incubations lacking the enzyme. The apparent molecular mass of the purified enzyme was determined by 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis according to Laemmli (20Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1971; 227: 680-685Crossref Scopus (206983) Google Scholar). A low molecular weight marker kit (Bio-Rad) was used as a reference. The gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250. The corrinoid content of CprA was estimated from the absorption spectrum of the dicyano derivative using an extinction coefficient, ε580, of 10.13 mm−1 cm−1 (21Ljungdahl L.G. LeGall J. Lee J.-P. Biochemistry. 1973; 12: 1802-1808Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). A 48-element metal analysis was performed using the Jarrel-Ash 965 Atomcomp Plasma Emission Spectrograph at the Chemical Analysis Laboratory, University of Georgia (Athens, GA). Acid-labile sulfide was determined according to a previous study (22Rabinowitz J.C. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 53: 275-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). To determine the N-terminal amino acid sequence, purified enzyme was transferred from a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon polyvinylidene difluoride, Millipore Corp.) by blotting with a Trans-Blot SD semidry transferring cell (Bio-Rad). Blotting was carried out at 36 V for 1.5 h using a transfer buffer containing 20 mm Tris, 150 mmglycine, and 20% methanol, pH 9.1. The transferred protein band was stained with 0.1% Amido black, excised, and sequenced by automated N-terminal Edman degradation using an ABI-494 Procise sequencer. The 3-chloro-4-hydroxybenzoate reductive dehalogenase (CprA) was purified from D. chlororespiranscells that were grown on pyruvate as a carbon and electron source and 3-chloro-4-hydroxybenzoate as an electron acceptor. More than 90% of the enzyme activity was found in the membrane fraction and was extracted with the nonionic detergent Triton X-100 (3% v/v) (TableI).

During purification, the specific activity increased 181-fold to a final value of 15.4 units/mg of protein. SDS-gel electrophoresis analysis of purified dehalogenase revealed a single band of ∼50-kDa molecular mass (Fig.2). The requirement for detergent to stabilize the protein prevents an accurate determination of the native molecular mass. For example, the size of the monomeric PCE reductive dehalogenase from D. strain PCE-S was determined by gel filtration to be 198 kDa, which is more than three times higher than the apparent mass estimated by SDS-page electrophoresis (65 kDa) (24Miller E. Wohlfarth G. Diekert G. Arch. Microbiol. 1998; 169: 497-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Similar results were obtained for the PCE reductive dehalogenase from Dehalobacter restrictus (25Schumacher W. Holliger C. Zehnder A.J.B. Hagen W.R. FEBS Lett. 1997; 409: 421-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). As shown by gel filtration and ultracentrifugation studies of heterodisulfide reductase, which is also isolated in the presence of Triton, much of the molecular mass is contributed by tightly associated detergent (26Simianu M. Murakami E. Brewer J.M. Ragsdale S.W. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10027-10039Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The N-terminal amino acid sequence of CprA is AATDTLNYVPGRKKQNSKLL. This sequence is similar to those of dehalogenases from other Desulfitobacteria, e.g. D. hafniense (55%), D. dehalogenans (45%),D. viet-1 (45%), and D. PCE-1 (45%) (Fig.3). Because the first amino acid is Ala, the protein probably has been post-translationally processed as have the other dehalogenases, which contain a 40-amino acid signal sequence that is removed as the protein matures and binds to the bacterial membrane (27Berks B.C. Sargent F. Palmer T. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 35: 260-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). All the published sequences of the reductive dehalogenases that correspond to an active protein fromDesulfitobacterium strains contain a conserved NYVPG sequence (Fig. 3). After treating the 3-chloro-4-hydroxybenzoate reductive dehalogenase with potassium cyanide at 90 °C and removing the protein precipitate, the typical visible light absorption spectrum of dicyano-cob(III)alamin (21Ljungdahl L.G. LeGall J. Lee J.-P. Biochemistry. 1973; 12: 1802-1808Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) is observed (inset in Fig.4). Using an extinction coefficient at 580 nm of 10.13 mm−1 cm−1 (21Ljungdahl L.G. LeGall J. Lee J.-P. Biochemistry. 1973; 12: 1802-1808Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), the corrinoid content is 0.84 ± 0.05 mol corrinoid/mol of subunit. Besides cobalamin, a monomeric unit of the enzyme contains 7.6 g-atm iron and 1.0 g-atm Co, based on metal analysis, and 8.1 mol of acid-labile sulfide. These results sugest that the dehalogenase fromD. chlororespirans contains one corrinoid and two iron-sulfur clusters per monomeric unit. Except for the enzyme fromDesulfomonile tiedjei, which is apparently a heme enzyme (28Ni S. Fredrickson J.K. Xun L. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 5135-5139Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), the reductive dehalogenases so far purified from dehalorespiring organisms contain cobamide and iron-sulfur clusters. The D. chlororespirans enzyme is completely inhibited when the enzyme is incubated with 450 µm propyl iodide. Approximately 50% of its initial activity is regained when the enzyme is exposed to light. This characteristic of many cobamide-containing proteins provides evidence for an important role of the corrinoid in the dehalogenation reaction. The dehalogenase activity is 90% inhibited by incubation with 45 mm KCN and completely inhibited by 4 mm sodium sulfite or 7 mm EDTA. Sodium citrate had no influence on the dehalogenation activity at concentrations up to 170 mm. The UV-visible spectrum of the native enzyme has a broad absorption maximum between 410 and 450 nm and a shoulder at 310 nm (Fig. 4). This spectrum is reminiscent of the corrinoid iron-sulfur protein from acetogens (29Ragsdale S.W. Lindahl P.A. Münck E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 14289-14297Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and methanogens (30Jablonski P.E. Lu W.-P. Ragsdale S.W. Ferry J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 325-329Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The absorption maximum at 410 nm, which is assigned to the iron-sulfur clusters, is superimposed on the absorbance in the 450- to 470-nm region, which is characteristic of cobalamin in the 2+ oxidation state. The lack of absorption peaks at 385–390 nm or at 360 nm indicates that there is little cob(I)alamin or cob(III)alamin, respectively, in the as-isolated dehalogenase, which is a characteristic of many corrinoid proteins (31Ragsdale S.W. Banerjee R. Chemistry and Biochemistry of B12. John Wiley and Sons, New York1999: 633-654Google Scholar). Because the Co(II)/(I) couple is generally between −500 and −600 mV and the Co(III)/(II) couple is approximately +200 mV (32Krautler B. Banerjee R. Chemistry and Biochemistry of B12. John Wiley and Sons, New York1999: 315-339Google Scholar), most corrinoid proteins isolated in the presence of mild reductants, like dithiothreitol, are found in the Co(II) state. In contrast to the PCE reductive dehalogenase from D. multivorans, which can be effectively reduced with titanium(III) citrate (33Neumann A. Wohlfarth G. Diekert G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16515-16519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), a redox mediator is required to observe catalysis by theD. chlororespirans enzyme. No dehalogenation was observed with dithionite (up to 110 mm) or titanium(III) citrate (up to 13 mm) alone as electron donors. Methyl viologen serves as an effective redox dye. Dehalogenase activity is observed in crude extracts of D. chlororespirans with or even without titanium(III) citrate presumably due to the physiological electron donor that is present in the extract (34Loffler F.E. Sanford R.A. Tiedje J.M. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1996; 62: 3809-3813Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The pH optimum of the dehalogenase is ∼6.8 (not shown, Supplemental Fig. 1S). The highest enzymatic activity was obtained at 59 °C (not shown, Supplemental Fig. 2S), which is similar to the property of a partially purified dehalogenase from D. chlororespirans(34Loffler F.E. Sanford R.A. Tiedje J.M. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1996; 62: 3809-3813Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The oxygen sensitivity of the CprA (t 12 = 77 min) is similar to those of the enzymes from D. dehalogenans(t 12 = 90 min (35van de Pas B.A. Smidt H. Hagen W.R. van der Oost J. Schraa G. Stams A.J. de Vos W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20287-20292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar)), D. strain PCE-S (t 12 = 50 min (24Miller E. Wohlfarth G. Diekert G. Arch. Microbiol. 1998; 169: 497-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar)) and the membrane fraction of D. hafniense (t 12 = 100 (23Christiansen N. Ahring B.K. Wohlfarth G. Diekert G. FEBS Lett. 1998; 436: 159-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar)). The only known oxygen-stable reductive dehalogenase is the heme-containing enzyme from D. tiedjei (28Ni S. Fredrickson J.K. Xun L. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 5135-5139Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Given the potential use of reductive dehalogenases in environmental bioremediation, it is important to establish their substrate specificity. CprA exhibits Michaelis-Menten kinetics with a variety of chlorinated phenols (Fig. 5and TableII). The substrate range of the purified dehalogenase (Table II) agrees well with that reported for theD. chlororespirans cells (17Sanford R. Cole J. Loffler F. Tiedje J. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1996; 62: 3800-3808Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and its membrane fraction (34Loffler F.E. Sanford R.A. Tiedje J.M. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1996; 62: 3809-3813Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that a single enzyme is involved in dehalogenation of chlorinated phenols by this bacterium. We compared the specificity parameters (kcat/Km) for different chlorinated aromatics that can undergo dehalogenation, including 3-chloro-4-hydroxybenzoate, 3,5-chloro-4-hydroxybenzoate, 3-chloro-4-hydroxyphenylacetate, 2,3-dichlorophenol, 2.6-dichlorophenol, 2,4,6-trichlorophenol, and pentachlorophenol (TableII).

Tenca P. Frittoli E. Tocchetti A. Innocenti M. Giardina G. Fiore P.P. D EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2393-2398Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). They are best characterized for their role in regulating the actin cytoskeleton but also partake in other activities, such as cell proliferation, gene expression, and apoptosis (2Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5184) Google Scholar, 3Symons M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 178-181Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Like other small GTPases, they exhibit both GDP/GTP binding and GTPase activities, and their active states are mediated by cycling between GTP-bound active and GDP-bound inactive forms. Regulation of the cycle is achieved through the opposing effects of three different classes of protein: 1) GTPase-activating proteins, 2) guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs),1 and 3) guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitors. Determination of GDP-bound or GTP-bound forms of Rho proteins is linked to other pathways by interactions of regulatory proteins with other components in the cell.RhoGEFs activate Rho GTPases by catalyzing the exchange of GDP with GTP at the nucleotide binding site. More than 35 RhoGEFs have been identified (1Scita G. Tenca P. Frittoli E. Tocchetti A. Innocenti M. Giardina G. Fiore P.P. D EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2393-2398Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), all containing the signature tandem array of Dbl homology and pleckstrin homology domains responsible for nucleotide exchange activity. RhoGEFs are large proteins with additional functional domains that modulate nucleotide exchange activities or link the RhoGEFs to other pathways in the cell (4Kozasa T. Jiang X. Kozasa T. Roscoe W.

Diverse domains on RhoGEFs have evolved in support of varying Rho GTPase activities in different tissues and cells.p190RhoGEF is a neuron-enriched Rho-specific GDP/GTP exchange factor that activates RhoA in vitro as well as in neuronal cells (9Gebbink M.F. Kranenburg O. Poland M. van Horck F.P. Houssa B. Moolenaar W.H. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1603-1613Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 10van Horck F.P. Ahmadian M.R. Haeusler L.C. Moolenaar W.H. Kranenburg O. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4948-4956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Upstream of its Dbl homology/pleckstrin homology domain, p190RhoGEF contains a leucine-rich domain and a cysteine-rich zinc finger-like motif, which are dispensable for the catalytic activity of RhoGEF in vivo (9Gebbink M.F. Kranenburg O. Poland M. van Horck F.P. Houssa B. Moolenaar W.H. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1603-1613Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). In addition, p190RhoGEF contains a predicted α-helical coiled-coil motif in the C-terminal region of the molecule. This C-terminal region was recently shown to interact directly with microtubules (10van Horck F.P. Ahmadian M.R. Haeusler L.C. Moolenaar W.H. Kranenburg O. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4948-4956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase-interacting protein-1 (11Meyer D. Liu A. Margolis B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35113-35118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) as well as with a destabilizing element in the 3′-untranslated region of the light neurofilament (NF-L) mRNA (12Canete-Soler R. Wu J.H. Zhai J.B. Shamim M. Schlaepfer W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32046-32050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The highly interactive properties of the C-terminal region of p190RhoGEF are of particular interest in view of their potential involvement in different regulatory processes in the cell.In this study, we have further explored the interactive properties of C-terminal domain of p190RhoGEF using a two-hybrid screen. We now report the specific binding of 14-3-3 to the C-terminal region of p190RhoGEF. We further show that binding of 14-3-3 is isoform-specific and that the binding site in p190RhoGEF does not conform to previously reported 14-3-3 binding motifs. We also demonstrate interaction between p190RhoGEF and 14-3-3 when fused to fluorescent proteins and transfected in neuronal cells. Interactions with 14-3-3 link p190RhoGEF with multiple pathways in the neuron and may be instrumental in modulating signal transduction phenomena in differentiated neurons.DISCUSSIONThis study has identified novel interactions between the 14-3-3 adapter protein and the C-terminal domain of p190RhoGEF. The interactions were initially observed using the yeast two-hybrid system and subsequently confirmed by in vitro studies using biochemical methods and by in vivo studies using fluorescent protein-tagged fusion proteins. Biochemical studies also characterized the specificity of p190RhoGEF-C binding to different 14-3-3 isoforms, including η, ε, β, and γ but not ζ or τ isoforms. Isoform binding specificities could modify binding affinities to a particular substrate upon dimerization of isoforms or facilitate interactions between diverse substrates upon heterodimerization of isoforms with differing binding properties (15Rosenquist M. Sehnke P. Ferl R.J. Sommarin M. Larsson C. J. Mol. Evol. 2000; 51: 446-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Such interactions may be particularly relevant in the nervous system where almost all 14-3-3 isoforms are expressed. In most cases, isoform specificities of the different ligands have not been examined. In the few reported instances, the patterns of binding and non-binding isoforms differ from those reported here (16McKinsey T.A. Zhang C.L. Olson E.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14400-14405Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar, 17Hsu S.Y. Kaipia A. Zhu L. Hsueh A.J.W. Mol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 33654-33660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar).The unique pattern of 14-3-3 isoform binding to p190RhoGEF may relate to the novel 14-3-3 binding site in the C-terminal domain of p190RhoGEF. Whereas most 14-3-3 binding sites are dependent upon a specific phosphoserine residue within a serine-rich consensus binding motif (13Muslin A.J. Tanner J.W. Allen P.M. Shaw A.S. Cell. 1996; 84: 889-897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1181) Google Scholar, 14Liu Y.C. Liu Y. Elly C. Yoshida H. Lipkowitz S. Altman A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9979-9985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), the binding site in p190RhoGEF (I1370QAIQNL) does not contain a target residue for phosphorylation, and its binding properties are not affected by treatment with nonspecific phosphatase. Both phosphorylation-dependent and -independent binding of ligands to 14-3-3 are believed to occur at a conserved amphipathic groove, with apposing hydrophobic and charged surfaces in all 14-3-3 isoforms (19Masters S.C. Pederson K.J. Zhang L. Barbieri J.T. Fu H. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5216-5221Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 20Wang B. Yang H. Liu Y.C. Jelinek T. Zhang L. Ruoslahti E. Fu H. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 12499-12504Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). It seems likely that the polar and nonpolar residues in the p190RhoGEF binding site may be instrumental in binding to the charged and uncharged surfaces in the amphipathic groove, as disposed in the different isoforms.Whereas deletion of the binding site in p190RhoGEF was able to abolish interaction with 14-3-3 in a GST pull-down assay and abrogated 14-3-3 effects on self-aggregation of EGFP/p190RhoGEF fusion proteins, deletion of the binding site did not prevent colocalization of DsRed1/14-3-3η fusion protein in the cytoplasmic aggregates. The latter findings could be interpreted as indicating additional interactive sites on p190RhoGEF in vivo or the presence of wild-type endogenous p190RhoGEF in the cytoplasmic aggregates. Alternatively, the colocalization of DsRed1/14-3-3η with EGFP/p190RhoGEF-C(Δ1370–1376) could reflect the highly interactive properties of the respective fusion protein and their binding to common components in the cell. The latter interpretation would favor the presence of 14-3-3 and p190RhoGEF in a multimolecular complex and could potentiate their respective interactions with the multiple binding partners already defined.The ability of DsRed1/14-3-3η to reduce the aggregation of EGFP/p190RhoGEF-C and EGFP/p190RhoGEF indicates that binding of 14-3-3 is able to interfere with self-aggregation sites in the C-terminal domain of p190RhoGEF. The presence of endogenous 14-3-3 may therefore serve to maintain the exchange factor in a non-aggregative state. Indeed, the self-aggregative properties of C-terminal domain of p190RhoGEF are reduced in the context of the full-length protein. In cotransfected cells, the full-length EGFP/p190RhoGEF has a diffuse cytoplasmic distribution with focal submembranous accumulations, not unlike the immunofluorescence localization of endogenous p190RhoGEF (10van Horck F.P. Ahmadian M.R. Haeusler L.C. Moolenaar W.H. Kranenburg O. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4948-4956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar).It is noteworthy that the interactions between 14-3-3 and p190RhoGEF caused a redistribution of fusion proteins in the cytoplasm but did not alter the exclusion of EGFP/p190RhoGEF-C and EGFP/p190RhoGEF from the nucleus. The findings indicate that binding to 14-3-3 does not affect sites in p190RhoGEF governing its lack of nuclear transport, as noted with other 14-3-3 ligands (21Xing H. Kornfeld K. Muslin A.J. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 294-300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 22Cacace A.M. Michaud N.R. Therrien M. Mathes K. Copeland T. Rubin G.M. Morrison D.K. Mol. Cell.

This may be relevant in view of the likely considerable excess of endogenous 14-3-3, compared with p190RhoGEF, in neuronal cytoplasm (24Skoulakis E.M.C. Davis R.L. Mol. Neurobiol. 1998; 16: 269-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar).Recent studies have uncovered some novel and unique features of p190RhoGEF which suggest that interactions between 14-3-3 and p190RhoGEF may have a potentially important role in modulating p190RhoGEF function in diverse neuronal pathways. First, p190RhoGEF has been identified as an RNA-binding protein that binds to a destabilizing element and regulates the stability of light neurofilament (NF-L) mRNA (12Canete-Soler R. Wu J.H. Zhai J.B. Shamim M. Schlaepfer W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32046-32050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Second, p190RhoGEF is interconnected to the c-Jun N-terminal kinase pathway by virtue of its binding to c-Jun N-terminal kinase-interacting protein-1 (11Meyer D. Liu A. Margolis B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35113-35118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) and by the anti-apoptotic activity conferred by transfecting EGFP/p190RhoGEF-C in neuronal cells.2 Third, the activity of p190RhoGEF as an exchange factor is reported to require the binding of an unknown factor in vivo (10van Horck F.P. Ahmadian M.R. Haeusler L.C. Moolenaar W.H. Kranenburg O. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4948-4956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Finally, the pattern of p190RhoGEF expression,2 like that of c-Jun N-terminal kinase-interacting protein-1 (25Dickens M. Rogers J.S. Cavanagh J. Raitano A. Xia Z. Halpern J.R. Greenberg M.E. Sawyers C.L. Davis R.J. Science. 1997; 277: 693-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar) and 14-3-3 (26Watanabe M. Isobe T. Ichimura T. Kuwano R. Takahashi Y. Kondo H. Inoue Y. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1994; 25: 113-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 27Watanabe M. Isobe T. Ichimura T. Kuwano R. Takahashi Y. Kondo H. Brain Res. Dev.

Brain Res. 1991; 10: 151-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), suggests a functional activity in differentiated neurons. Interactions between 14-3-3 and p190RhoGEF could serve to interface the varying activities of the exchange factor with other pathways in the cell. Integration of signals from diverse pathways may be important in maintaining the homeostasis of differentiated neurons. The extensive binding of 14-3-3 to multiple substrates could be viewed as a buffer-like activity for transitioning neurons to a differentiated state and limiting interactions that might be disruptive in a fully differentiated state. Rho GTPases are a subgroup of Ras GTPases and include at least 14 different members (1Scita G. Tenca P. Frittoli E. Tocchetti A. Innocenti M. Giardina G. Fiore P.P.

They are best characterized for their role in regulating the actin cytoskeleton but also partake in other activities, such as cell proliferation, gene expression, and apoptosis (2Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5184) Google Scholar, 3Symons M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 178-181Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Like other small GTPases, they exhibit both GDP/GTP binding and GTPase activities, and their active states are mediated by cycling between GTP-bound active and GDP-bound inactive forms. Regulation of the cycle is achieved through the opposing effects of three different classes of protein: 1) GTPase-activating proteins, 2) guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs),1 and 3) guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitors. Determination of GDP-bound or GTP-bound forms of Rho proteins is linked to other pathways by interactions of regulatory proteins with other components in the cell. RhoGEFs activate Rho GTPases by catalyzing the exchange of GDP with GTP at the nucleotide binding site. More than 35 RhoGEFs have been identified (1Scita G. Tenca P. Frittoli E. Tocchetti A. Innocenti M. Giardina G. Fiore P.P. D EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2393-2398Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), all containing the signature tandem array of Dbl homology and pleckstrin homology domains responsible for nucleotide exchange activity. RhoGEFs are large proteins with additional functional domains that modulate nucleotide exchange activities or link the RhoGEFs to other pathways in the cell (4Kozasa T. Jiang X. Kozasa T. Roscoe W.

Diverse domains on RhoGEFs have evolved in support of varying Rho GTPase activities in different tissues and cells. p190RhoGEF is a neuron-enriched Rho-specific GDP/GTP exchange factor that activates RhoA in vitro as well as in neuronal cells (9Gebbink M.F. Kranenburg O. Poland M. van Horck F.P. Houssa B. Moolenaar W.H. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1603-1613Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 10van Horck F.P. Ahmadian M.R. Haeusler L.C. Moolenaar W.H. Kranenburg O. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4948-4956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Upstream of its Dbl homology/pleckstrin homology domain, p190RhoGEF contains a leucine-rich domain and a cysteine-rich zinc finger-like motif, which are dispensable for the catalytic activity of RhoGEF in vivo (9Gebbink M.F. Kranenburg O. Poland M. van Horck F.P. Houssa B. Moolenaar W.H. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1603-1613Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). In addition, p190RhoGEF contains a predicted α-helical coiled-coil motif in the C-terminal region of the molecule. This C-terminal region was recently shown to interact directly with microtubules (10van Horck F.P. Ahmadian M.R. Haeusler L.C. Moolenaar W.H. Kranenburg O. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4948-4956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase-interacting protein-1 (11Meyer D. Liu A. Margolis B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35113-35118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) as well as with a destabilizing element in the 3′-untranslated region of the light neurofilament (NF-L) mRNA (12Canete-Soler R. Wu J.H. Zhai J.B. Shamim M. Schlaepfer W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32046-32050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The highly interactive properties of the C-terminal region of p190RhoGEF are of particular interest in view of their potential involvement in different regulatory processes in the cell. In this study, we have further explored the interactive properties of C-terminal domain of p190RhoGEF using a two-hybrid screen. We now report the specific binding of 14-3-3 to the C-terminal region of p190RhoGEF. We further show that binding of 14-3-3 is isoform-specific and that the binding site in p190RhoGEF does not conform to previously reported 14-3-3 binding motifs. We also demonstrate interaction between p190RhoGEF and 14-3-3 when fused to fluorescent proteins and transfected in neuronal cells. Interactions with 14-3-3 link p190RhoGEF with multiple pathways in the neuron and may be instrumental in modulating signal transduction phenomena in differentiated neurons. DISCUSSIONThis study has identified novel interactions between the 14-3-3 adapter protein and the C-terminal domain of p190RhoGEF. The interactions were initially observed using the yeast two-hybrid system and subsequently confirmed by in vitro studies using biochemical methods and by in vivo studies using fluorescent protein-tagged fusion proteins. Biochemical studies also characterized the specificity of p190RhoGEF-C binding to different 14-3-3 isoforms, including η, ε, β, and γ but not ζ or τ isoforms. Isoform binding specificities could modify binding affinities to a particular substrate upon dimerization of isoforms or facilitate interactions between diverse substrates upon heterodimerization of isoforms with differing binding properties (15Rosenquist M. Sehnke P. Ferl R.J. Sommarin M. Larsson C. J. Mol. Evol. 2000; 51: 446-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Such interactions may be particularly relevant in the nervous system where almost all 14-3-3 isoforms are expressed. In most cases, isoform specificities of the different ligands have not been examined. In the few reported instances, the patterns of binding and non-binding isoforms differ from those reported here (16McKinsey T.A. Zhang C.L. Olson E.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14400-14405Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar, 17Hsu S.Y. Kaipia A. Zhu L. Hsueh A.J.W. Mol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 33654-33660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar).The unique pattern of 14-3-3 isoform binding to p190RhoGEF may relate to the novel 14-3-3 binding site in the C-terminal domain of p190RhoGEF. Whereas most 14-3-3 binding sites are dependent upon a specific phosphoserine residue within a serine-rich consensus binding motif (13Muslin A.J. Tanner J.W. Allen P.M. Shaw A.S. Cell. 1996; 84: 889-897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1181) Google Scholar, 14Liu Y.C. Liu Y. Elly C. Yoshida H. Lipkowitz S. Altman A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9979-9985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), the binding site in p190RhoGEF (I1370QAIQNL) does not contain a target residue for phosphorylation, and its binding properties are not affected by treatment with nonspecific phosphatase. Both phosphorylation-dependent and -independent binding of ligands to 14-3-3 are believed to occur at a conserved amphipathic groove, with apposing hydrophobic and charged surfaces in all 14-3-3 isoforms (19Masters S.C. Pederson K.J. Zhang L. Barbieri J.T. Fu H. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5216-5221Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 20Wang B. Yang H. Liu Y.C. Jelinek T. Zhang L. Ruoslahti E. Fu H. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 12499-12504Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). It seems likely that the polar and nonpolar residues in the p190RhoGEF binding site may be instrumental in binding to the charged and uncharged surfaces in the amphipathic groove, as disposed in the different isoforms.Whereas deletion of the binding site in p190RhoGEF was able to abolish interaction with 14-3-3 in a GST pull-down assay and abrogated 14-3-3 effects on self-aggregation of EGFP/p190RhoGEF fusion proteins, deletion of the binding site did not prevent colocalization of DsRed1/14-3-3η fusion protein in the cytoplasmic aggregates. The latter findings could be interpreted as indicating additional interactive sites on p190RhoGEF in vivo or the presence of wild-type endogenous p190RhoGEF in the cytoplasmic aggregates. Alternatively, the colocalization of DsRed1/14-3-3η with EGFP/p190RhoGEF-C(Δ1370–1376) could reflect the highly interactive properties of the respective fusion protein and their binding to common components in the cell. The latter interpretation would favor the presence of 14-3-3 and p190RhoGEF in a multimolecular complex and could potentiate their respective interactions with the multiple binding partners already defined.The ability of DsRed1/14-3-3η to reduce the aggregation of EGFP/p190RhoGEF-C and EGFP/p190RhoGEF indicates that binding of 14-3-3 is able to interfere with self-aggregation sites in the C-terminal domain of p190RhoGEF. The presence of endogenous 14-3-3 may therefore serve to maintain the exchange factor in a non-aggregative state. Indeed, the self-aggregative properties of C-terminal domain of p190RhoGEF are reduced in the context of the full-length protein. In cotransfected cells, the full-length EGFP/p190RhoGEF has a diffuse cytoplasmic distribution with focal submembranous accumulations, not unlike the immunofluorescence localization of endogenous p190RhoGEF (10van Horck F.P.

Chem. 2001; 276: 4948-4956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar).It is noteworthy that the interactions between 14-3-3 and p190RhoGEF caused a redistribution of fusion proteins in the cytoplasm but did not alter the exclusion of EGFP/p190RhoGEF-C and EGFP/p190RhoGEF from the nucleus. The findings indicate that binding to 14-3-3 does not affect sites in p190RhoGEF governing its lack of nuclear transport, as noted with other 14-3-3 ligands (21Xing H. Kornfeld K. Muslin A.J. Curr.

This may be relevant in view of the likely considerable excess of endogenous 14-3-3, compared with p190RhoGEF, in neuronal cytoplasm (24Skoulakis E.M.C. Davis R.L. Mol. Neurobiol. 1998; 16: 269-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar).Recent studies have uncovered some novel and unique features of p190RhoGEF which suggest that interactions between 14-3-3 and p190RhoGEF may have a potentially important role in modulating p190RhoGEF function in diverse neuronal pathways. First, p190RhoGEF has been identified as an RNA-binding protein that binds to a destabilizing element and regulates the stability of light neurofilament (NF-L) mRNA (12Canete-Soler R. Wu J.H. Zhai J.B. Shamim M. Schlaepfer W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32046-32050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Second, p190RhoGEF is interconnected to the c-Jun N-terminal kinase pathway by virtue of its binding to c-Jun N-terminal kinase-interacting protein-1 (11Meyer D. Liu A. Margolis B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35113-35118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) and by the anti-apoptotic activity conferred by transfecting EGFP/p190RhoGEF-C in neuronal cells.2 Third, the activity of p190RhoGEF as an exchange factor is reported to require the binding of an unknown factor in vivo (10van Horck F.P.

Finally, the pattern of p190RhoGEF expression,2 like that of c-Jun N-terminal kinase-interacting protein-1 (25Dickens M. Rogers J.S. Cavanagh J. Raitano A. Xia Z. Halpern J.R. Greenberg M.E.

Interactions between 14-3-3 and p190RhoGEF could serve to interface the varying activities of the exchange factor with other pathways in the cell. Integration of signals from diverse pathways may be important in maintaining the homeostasis of differentiated neurons. The extensive binding of 14-3-3 to multiple substrates could be viewed as a buffer-like activity for transitioning neurons to a differentiated state and limiting interactions that might be disruptive in a fully differentiated state.

Chem. 1999; 380: 945-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar).Although InsP5 and InsP6 are the most abundant inositol polyphosphates in cells, their functions in vertebrate cells have begun to be elucidated only recently. InsP6 has been reported to inhibit Golgi coatomer K+ channels (6Fleischer B. Xie J. Mayrleitner M. Shears S.B. Palmer D.J. Fleischer S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17826-17832Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and to inhibit clathrin cage assembly by binding to the clathrin assembly proteins AP-2 (7Beck K.A. Keen J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4442-4447Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and AP-3 (8Norris F.A. Ungewickell E. Majerus P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 214-217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 9Ye W. Ali N. Bembenek M.E. Shears S.B. Lafer E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1564-1568Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Both InsP5 and InsP6 have also been shown to inhibit several serine-threonine protein phosphatases, resulting in stimulation of whole-cell Ca2+ currents in pancreatic cells (10Larsson O. Barker C.J. Sjoholm A. Carlqvist H. Michell R.H. Bertorello A. Nilsson T. Honkanen R.E. Mayr G.W. Zwiller J. Berggren P.-O. Science. 1997; 278: 471-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Depletion of InsP5 and InsP6 in 293 cells by overexpression of the Salmonella inositol phosphatase SopB results in the inhibition of nuclear mRNA export (11Feng Y. Wente S.R. Majerus P.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 875-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar).5/6-Kinase is conserved from plants to humans and is found even inEntamoeba histolytica (12Field J. Wilson M.P. Mai Z. Majerus P.W. Samuelson J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2000; 108: 119-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The human and calf brain enzymes produce more Ins(1,3,4,6)P4 than Ins(1,3,4,5)P4, whereas the ratio of products produced by the plant enzyme is reversed (13Wilson M.P. Majerus P.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 232: 678-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In E. histolytica, the enzyme utilizes both Ins(1,3,4)P3 and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (Ins(1,4,5)P3) as substrates. The two tetrakisphosphate products are produced in equal amounts from Ins(1,3,4)P3, but when Ins(1,4,5)P3 is the substrate only Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 is a product. The activity of the amoebae enzyme is very low compared with that of the human and plant enzymes, which may be because of the fact that the inositol polyphosphates found in E. histolytica are notmyo-derivatives but are neo-derivatives (14Martin J.-B. Laussmann T. Bakker-Grunwald T. Vogel G., K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10134-10140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In addition to producing two distinct isomers of InsP4 from a single substrate, it has been shown recently that 5/6-kinase can utilize inositol 3,4,5,6-tetrakisphosphate (Ins(3,4,5,6)P4) as a substrate for 1-kinase activity to produce InsP5(15Yang X. Shears S.B. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 551-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar).Regulation of the activity of 5/6-kinase by cells is not well understood. In adrenal glomerulosa cells, stimulation with angiotensin causes a rise in the level of Ins(1,3,4,6)P4 (16Balla T. Guillemette G. Baukal A.J. Catt K.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 148: 199-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). A rapid rise in this tetrakisphosphate isomer is also seen after platelet stimulation by thrombin (17King W.G. Downes C.P. Prestwich G.D. Rittenhouse S.E. Biochem. J. 1990; 270: 125-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In both cases, the levels of the 5/6-kinase substrate Ins(1,3,4)P3 are elevated prior to a rise in Ins(1,3,4,6)P4, and therefore the activity of 5/6-kinase under these conditions may not be changing.We therefore sought to identify several proteins that copurified with calf brain 5/6-kinase, assuming that copurification may reflect an interaction between these proteins within the cell. We identify these proteins as subunits of a large protein complex called the COP9 signalosome. This complex was described originally inArabidopsis seedlings in which a COP (constitutive photomorphogenesis) mutant was identified. The mutant, termedcop9, exhibited light-grown morphology when seedlings were grown in the dark. The protein responsible for the cop9mutation, COP9, was cloned and shown to be a component of a large protein complex, the COP9 signalosome complex (18Wei N. Chamovitz D.A. Deng X.-W. Cell. 1994; 78: 117-124Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). The complex consists of eight subunits designated Sgn1 through Sgn8 and is conserved in mammals (19Wei N. Deng X.-W. Trends Genet. 1999; 15: 98-103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). The only known function of the mammalian complex is the in vitro phosphorylation of IκBα, p105, and c-Jun (20Seeger M. Kraft R. Ferrell K. Bech-Otschir D. Dumdey R. Schade R. Gordon C. Naumann M. Dubiel W. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 469-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Overexpression of the COP9 signalosome subunit Sgn2 in HeLa cells results in an increase in complex assembly and an elevation in the cellular levels of c-Jun, which results in increased AP1 transactivation (21Naumann M. Bech-Otschir D. Huang X. Ferrell K. Dubiel W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35297-35300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The COP9 signalosome has been shown recently to play a role in the ubiquitin pathway in plants and in fission yeast. The Arabidopsis COP9 signalosome associates with the E3 ubiquitin ligase SCFTIR1 and is required for auxin-responsive protein degradation (22Schwechheimer C. Serino G. Callis J. Crosby W.M. Lyapina S. Deshaies R.J. Gray W.M. Estelle M. Deng X.-W. Science. 2001; 292: 1379-1382Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). In Schizosaccharomyces pombe, the complex associates with several cullins, ubiquitin ligases that are post-translationally modified by the ubiquitin-like protein NEDD8. COP9 mutants lacking one of the subunits of the complex accumulate NEDD8-modified proteins, indicating that the COP9 complex is required for deneddylation (23Lyapina S. Cope G. Shevchenko A. Serino G. Tsuge T. Zhou C. Wolf D.A. Wei N. Shevchenko A. Deshaies R.J. Science. 2001; 292: 1382-1385Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar).We show here that the calf brain COP9 signalosome complex phosphorylates c-Jun and ATF-2, another transcription factor known to be phosphorylated by stress-activated protein kinases. The calf brain complex contains a small amount of 5/6-kinase, which also phosphorylates c-Jun and ATF-2 in the absence of complex. 5/6-Kinase may represent the as yet unidentified protein kinase activity of the COP9 signalosome complex, which has been referred to as an associated kinase activity (21Naumann M. Bech-Otschir D. Huang X. Ferrell K. Dubiel W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35297-35300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of ATF-2 by 5/6-kinase is concentration dependent, enhanced by Mn2+, and unaffected by Ins(3,4,5,6)P4, a potent inhibitor of Ins(1,3,4)P3 phosphorylation and an alternative substrate for 5/6-kinase. Phosphorylation by 5/6-kinase occurs on serine/threonine residues. Fractionation of cytosolic extract from HEK 293 cells stably expressing human 5/6-kinase demonstrates a correlation between the inositol and protein kinase activities of 5/6-kinase. Depletion of 5/6-kinase using a polyclonal antiserum also partially removes the protein kinase activity. Purified, flag-tagged human 5/6-kinase expressed in Sf21 cells phosphorylates ATF-2, indicating that these two activities reside within 5/6-kinase or that the two kinases associate very tightly. In either case, this work establishes a link between the inositol polyphosphate signaling pathway and two of the transcription factors of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway.DISCUSSIONThe first member of the COP9 signalosome complex was identified originally in a genetic screen of Arabidopsis seedlings. The complex subsequently has been found in many organisms, with the exception of S. cerevisiae (19Wei N. Deng X.-W. Trends Genet. 1999; 15: 98-103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). We show here that the calf brain COP9 signalosome complex co-purifies with Ins(1,3,4)P3 5/6-kinase, an enzyme conserved from such diverse sources as plants (13Wilson M.P. Majerus P.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 232: 678-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), E. histolytica (12Field J. Wilson M.P. Mai Z. Majerus P.W. Samuelson J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2000; 108: 119-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), and humans (24Wilson M.P. Majerus P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11904-11910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Similar to the COP9 signalosome complex, there is no 5/6-kinase homologue in S. cerevisiae. The purification scheme of 5/6-kinase used repeated chromatography on heparin agarose (24Wilson M.P. Majerus P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11904-11910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The cauliflower COP9 complex also binds heparin (37Chamovitz D.A. Wei N. Osterlund M.T. von Arnim A.G. Staub J.M. Matsui M. Deng X.-W. Cell. 1996; 86: 115-121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Heparin binding alone is unlikely to account for the co-purification, because differential binding in the presence and absence of magnesium as well as affinity elution with InsP6 were used. Even after the final purification step, some 5/6-kinase was detected in the fractions containing complex. It is therefore likely that 5/6-kinase associates with the COP9 signalosome complex.The function of the mammalian COP9 signalosome complex is unknown, although it has been shown to phosphorylate several proteins including c-Jun (20Seeger M. Kraft R. Ferrell K. Bech-Otschir D. Dumdey R. Schade R. Gordon C. Naumann M. Dubiel W. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 469-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). In this report, we show that the complex and 5/6-kinase purified from calf brain phosphorylate c-Jun as well as ATF-2. All preparations of complex used here contain some 5/6-kinase, which may represent the COP9 signalosome-associated kinase activity that to date has not yet been identified. In samples prepared for phospho amino acid analysis, the relative amount of 32P incorporated into ATF-2 was significantly greater than that of c-Jun. This could indicate that ATF-2 is a better in vitro substrate for 5/6-kinase or that there may be multiple sites of phosphorylation on ATF-2.Phosphorylation of ATF-2 by 5/6 kinase occurs predominantly on serine residues, with a minor amount of threonine phosphorylation. There is no evidence of tyrosine phosphorylation of ATF-2 by 5/6-kinase. Phosphorylation of ATF-2 by p38 occurs on threonine residues 69 and 71 (33), which results in increased stability of ATF-2 by protection from ubiquitination and subsequent degradation (38Fuchs S.Y. Tappin I. Ronai Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12560-12564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). ATF-2 has also been shown to be phosphorylated on threonine residues 69 and 71 as well as Ser-90 by stress-activated protein kinases, with phosphorylation depending on UV treatment of the cells (32Livingstone C. Patel G. Jones N. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1785-1797Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). Protein kinase Cα has been reported to phosphorylate ATF-2 on Ser-121 in response to retinoic acid or induction with E1A (39Kawasaki H. Song J. Eckner R. Ugai H. Chiu R. Taira K. Shi Y. Jones N. Yokoyama K.K. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 233-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The consequences of phosphorylation of ATF-2 by 5/6-kinase remain to be determined.Phosphorylation of a protein substrate by an inositol kinase has been demonstrated by several lipid kinases. PI3-kinase has been shown to phosphorylate the insulin receptor substrate IRS-1 (40Lam K. Carpenter C.L. Ruderman N.B. Friel J.C. Kelly K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20648-20652Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the adapter protein p101 and the protein kinase MEK-1 (41Bondev A. Rubio I. Wetzker R. Biol. Chem. 1999; 380: 1337-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Autophosphorylation has been reported to occur by PI3-kinase (reviewed in Ref. 46Hunter T. Cell. 1995; 83: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar), type I phosphatidylinositol phosphate 5-kinase isozymes (42Itoh T. Ishihara H. Shibasaki Y. Oka Y. Takenawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19389-19394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), and phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase β (43Zhao X.-H. Bondeva T. Balla T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14642-14648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of the transcription factors c-Jun and ATF-2 by 5/6-kinase represents the first example of protein phosphorylation by an inositol kinase that utilizes a soluble, as opposed to a lipid, inositol polyphosphate as a substrate.Ins(3,4,5,6)P4 is not only a potent inhibitor of Ins(1,3,4)P3 phosphorylation by 5/6-kinase, but has been reported recently to be a substrate of this enzyme as well (15Yang X. Shears S.B. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 551-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). While inhibiting the inositol kinase activity of 5/6-kinase, this IP4 isomer has no effect on phosphorylation of ATF-2 by 5/6-kinase. We also show that MnCl2 inhibits Ins(1,3,4)P3 phosphorylation by 5/6-kinase but activates ATF-2 phosphorylation. Therefore, the inositol kinase and the protein kinase activities of 5/6-kinase seem to be regulated differently. Differential regulation of protein kinase activity and inositol kinase activity has been reported for PI3-kinase γ. A phosphatidylinositol lipid kinase-negative mutant of PI3-kinase γ retains the ability to autophosphorylate (44Bondeva T. Pirola L. Bulgarelli-Leva G. Rubio I. Wetzker R. Wymann M.P. Science. 1998; 282: 293-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). In addition, increasing concentrations of the βγ subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins increase the lipid kinase activity of PI3-kinase γ, whereas autophosphorylation and phosphorylation of MEK1 are reduced markedly by Gβγ (41Bondev A. Rubio I. Wetzker R. Biol. Chem. 1999; 380: 1337-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar).Human 5/6-kinase expressed in 293 cells and Sf21 cells exhibits both inositol kinase and protein kinase activity. The possibility of a protein kinase responsible for phosphorylation of c-Jun and ATF-2 contaminating the 5/6-kinase preparations used cannot be ruled out completely. This is unlikely, however, because it would require an interaction between the two kinases throughout the calf brain purification in addition to co-immunoprecipitation in the partially purified 293 cell extract. Additionally, the minimal amount of purified calf brain 5/6-kinase sufficient to phosphorylate ATF-2 is 0.4 ng. If a contaminant were responsible for the protein phosphorylation, it would be present in an extremely low concentration.There are no conventional protein kinase domains in 5/6-kinase, such as the ATP binding domain G-X-G-X-X-G (reviewed in Ref. 45Hanks S.K. Quinn A.M. Hunter T. Science. 1988; 241: 42-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (3782) Google Scholar). This is also the case for PI3-kinase, although a short stretch of amino acids distantly conserved between PI3-kinase and the protein kinase super family is found in the catalytic subdomains VIB and VII of protein kinases (46Hunter T. Cell. 1995; 83: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Shown in Fig.7is an alignment of the residues in human PI3-kinase (p110α), which have been reported to be conserved with protein kinases. The two aspartic acid residues (indicated inbold) are conserved amino acids in the protein kinase superfamily. These two residues, along with an arginine (bold), are also conserved in human phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase α and human 5/6-kinase. The first aspartic acid (5/6-kinase amino acid 105), found in subdomain VIB of protein kinases, is proposed to hydrogen-bond with the acceptor amino acid. The second aspartic acid (5/6-kinase amino acid 123), is involved in the chelation of Mg2+. The third conserved amino acid is an arginine found in the inositol lipid kinases and 5/6-kinase but not in protein kinases. Mutation of this arginine (5/6-kinase amino acid 106) has been shown to abolish both inositol lipid and protein kinase activity by PI3-kinase (47Dhand R. Hiles I. Panayotou G. Roche S. Fry M.J. Gout I. Totty N.F. Truong O. Vicendo P. Yonezawa K. Kasuga M. Courtneidge S.A. Waterfield M.D. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 522-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis of these residues of 5/6-kinase should establish whether they are critical to the inositol and/or protein kinase activities of this enzyme. The only protein kinase to which 5/6-kinase has any sequence similarity is the ε isoform of protein kinase C (24Wilson M.P. Majerus P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11904-11910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Of the three short stretches of sequence similarity between the two proteins, none of the conserved residues have been implicated in the catalytic activity of the protein kinase C isozymes (reviewed in Ref. 48Hug H. Sarre T.F. Biochem. J. 1993; 291: 329-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (1217) Google Scholar). Protein kinase Cε has been shown to be activated by phosphatidylinositol (3,4)P2 and phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)P3 (49Toker A. Meyer M. Reddy K.K. Falck J.R. Aneja R. Aneja S. Parra A. Burns D.J. Ballas L.M. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32358-32367Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and thus the regions of identity noted between protein kinase Cε and 5/6-kinase are more likely to be involved in inositol head group binding than in protein kinase activity. Mutagenesis of amino acid residues conserved between 5/6-kinase homologues from different species may shed light upon the structural requirements for inositol versus protein kinase activity.Phosphorylation of the transcription factors c-Jun and ATF-2 by 5/6-kinase implicates this inositol kinase in the stress response pathway. The 5/6-kinase homologue in E. histolytica was identified in a differential display polymerase chain reaction from control versus heat-shocked amoebae, whereby 5/6-kinase mRNA was increased in extracts of heat-shocked parasites (12Field J. Wilson M.P. Mai Z. Majerus P.W. Samuelson J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2000; 108: 119-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), lending additional support for the role of 5/6-kinase in the response of cells to stress. The trigger(s) responsible for the activation of 5/6-kinase in cells, and the cellular events following this activation remain to be determined. In addition, the role of the inositol polyphosphate products of 5/6-kinase in the stress response pathway have yet to be elucidated. The two functions of 5/6-kinase could represent a divergence of signals resulting from the activation of a single kinase by different stimuli having multiple cellular consequences. Signaling through the inositol phosphate pathway involves a series of kinases and phosphatases that phosphorylate and dephosphorylate the large number of soluble inositol polyphosphates known to exist in eukaryotic cells (1Shears S.B. Pharmacol. Ther. 1991; 49: 79-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). A branch point in this pathway occurs with the production of inositol 1,3,4-trisphosphate (Ins(1,3,4)P3)1, resulting from the hydrolysis of inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate (Ins(1,3,4,5)P4) by one of the numerous inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatase isozymes (2Majerus P.W. Kisseleva M.V. Norris F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10669-10672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Ins(1,3,4)P3 can be dephosphorylated by specific phosphatases, resulting ultimately in the generation of myo-inositol, or it can be phosphorylated further, resulting in the formation of higher phosphorylated forms of inositol. Inositol 1,3,4-trisphosphate 5/6-kinase (5/6-kinase) phosphorylates Ins(1,3,4)P3 to form both inositol 1,3,4,6-tetrakisphosphate (Ins(1,3,4,6)P4) and Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 (3Balla T. Guillemette G. Baukal A.J. Catt K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9952-9955Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Shears S.B. Parry J.B. Tang E.K.Y. Irvine R.F. Michell R.H. Kirk C.J. Biochem. J. 1987; 246: 139-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Ins(1,3,4,6)P4 is the first intermediate in the pathway leading to the formation of the higher phosphorylated inositols including other inositol tetrakisphosphate isomers, inositol 1,3,4,5,6-pentakisphosphate (InsP5), inositol hexakisphosphate (InsP6), and the pyrophosphate forms of inositol (5Safrany S.T. Caffrey J.J. Yang X. Shears S.B. Biol. Chem. 1999; 380: 945-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Although InsP5 and InsP6 are the most abundant inositol polyphosphates in cells, their functions in vertebrate cells have begun to be elucidated only recently. InsP6 has been reported to inhibit Golgi coatomer K+ channels (6Fleischer B. Xie J. Mayrleitner M. Shears S.B. Palmer D.J. Fleischer S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17826-17832Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and to inhibit clathrin cage assembly by binding to the clathrin assembly proteins AP-2 (7Beck K.A. Keen J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4442-4447Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and AP-3 (8Norris F.A. Ungewickell E. Majerus P.W. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 1564-1568Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Both InsP5 and InsP6 have also been shown to inhibit several serine-threonine protein phosphatases, resulting in stimulation of whole-cell Ca2+ currents in pancreatic cells (10Larsson O. Barker C.J. Sjoholm A. Carlqvist H. Michell R.H. Bertorello A. Nilsson T. Honkanen R.E. Mayr G.W. Zwiller J. Berggren P.-O. Science. 1997; 278: 471-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Depletion of InsP5 and InsP6 in 293 cells by overexpression of the Salmonella inositol phosphatase SopB results in the inhibition of nuclear mRNA export (11Feng Y. Wente S.R. Majerus P.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 875-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). 5/6-Kinase is conserved from plants to humans and is found even inEntamoeba histolytica (12Field J. Wilson M.P. Mai Z. Majerus P.W. Samuelson J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2000; 108: 119-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The human and calf brain enzymes produce more Ins(1,3,4,6)P4 than Ins(1,3,4,5)P4, whereas the ratio of products produced by the plant enzyme is reversed (13Wilson M.P. Majerus P.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 232: 678-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In E. histolytica, the enzyme utilizes both Ins(1,3,4)P3 and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (Ins(1,4,5)P3) as substrates. The two tetrakisphosphate products are produced in equal amounts from Ins(1,3,4)P3, but when Ins(1,4,5)P3 is the substrate only Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 is a product. The activity of the amoebae enzyme is very low compared with that of the human and plant enzymes, which may be because of the fact that the inositol polyphosphates found in E. histolytica are notmyo-derivatives but are neo-derivatives (14Martin J.-B. Laussmann T. Bakker-Grunwald T. Vogel G., K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10134-10140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In addition to producing two distinct isomers of InsP4 from a single substrate, it has been shown recently that 5/6-kinase can utilize inositol 3,4,5,6-tetrakisphosphate (Ins(3,4,5,6)P4) as a substrate for 1-kinase activity to produce InsP5(15Yang X. Shears S.B. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 551-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Regulation of the activity of 5/6-kinase by cells is not well understood. In adrenal glomerulosa cells, stimulation with angiotensin causes a rise in the level of Ins(1,3,4,6)P4 (16Balla T. Guillemette G. Baukal A.J. Catt K.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 148: 199-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). A rapid rise in this tetrakisphosphate isomer is also seen after platelet stimulation by thrombin (17King W.G. Downes C.P. Prestwich G.D. Rittenhouse S.E. Biochem. J. 1990; 270: 125-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In both cases, the levels of the 5/6-kinase substrate Ins(1,3,4)P3 are elevated prior to a rise in Ins(1,3,4,6)P4, and therefore the activity of 5/6-kinase under these conditions may not be changing. We therefore sought to identify several proteins that copurified with calf brain 5/6-kinase, assuming that copurification may reflect an interaction between these proteins within the cell. We identify these proteins as subunits of a large protein complex called the COP9 signalosome. This complex was described originally inArabidopsis seedlings in which a COP (constitutive photomorphogenesis) mutant was identified. The mutant, termedcop9, exhibited light-grown morphology when seedlings were grown in the dark. The protein responsible for the cop9mutation, COP9, was cloned and shown to be a component of a large protein complex, the COP9 signalosome complex (18Wei N. Chamovitz D.A. Deng X.-W. Cell. 1994; 78: 117-124Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). The complex consists of eight subunits designated Sgn1 through Sgn8 and is conserved in mammals (19Wei N. Deng X.-W. Trends Genet. 1999; 15: 98-103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). The only known function of the mammalian complex is the in vitro phosphorylation of IκBα, p105, and c-Jun (20Seeger M. Kraft R. Ferrell K. Bech-Otschir D. Dumdey R. Schade R. Gordon C. Naumann M.

Overexpression of the COP9 signalosome subunit Sgn2 in HeLa cells results in an increase in complex assembly and an elevation in the cellular levels of c-Jun, which results in increased AP1 transactivation (21Naumann M.

Insulin activation of glycogen synthesis is mediated in part by the inhibitory phosphorylation of glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3). In this study, catecholamine regulation of GSK-3β was investigated in Rat-1 fibroblasts stably expressing the α1A-adrenergic receptor. Treatment of these cells with either insulin or phenylephrine (PE), an α1-adrenergic receptor agonist, induced Ser-9 phosphorylation of GSK-3β and inhibited GSK-3β activity. Insulin-induced GSK-3β phosphorylation is mediated by the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt signaling pathway. PE treatment does not activate phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase or Akt (Ballou, L. M., Cross, M. E., Huang, S., McReynolds, E. M., Zhang, B. X., and Lin, R. Z. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275, 4803–4809), but instead inhibits insulin-induced Akt activation and GSK-3β phosphorylation. Experiments using protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitors suggest that phorbol ester-sensitive novel PKC and Gö6983-sensitive atypical PKC isoforms are involved in the PE-induced phosphorylation of GSK-3β. Indeed, PE treatment of Rat-1 cells increased the activity of atypical PKCζ, and expression of PKCζ in COS-7 cells stimulated GSK-3β Ser-9 phosphorylation. In addition, PE-induced GSK-3β phosphorylation was reduced in Rat-1 cells treated with a cell-permeable PKCζ pseudosubstrate peptide inhibitor. These results suggest that the α1A-adrenergic receptor regulates GSK-3β through two signaling pathways. One pathway inhibits insulin-induced GSK-3β phosphorylation by blocking insulin activation of Akt. The second pathway stimulates Ser-9 phosphorylation of GSK-3β, probably via PKC.

GSK-3 was initially identified as a kinase that phosphorylates glycogen synthase and has been found to play a key role in the regulation of glycogen metabolism in insulin-responsive cells (reviewed in Ref. 1Cohen P. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1999; 354: 485-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). GSK-3 also regulates cell fate determination inDictyostelium and has been intensively studied as a component of the Wg/Wnt signaling pathway in invertebrates and vertebrates that controls development (2Weeks G. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2000; 3: 625-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 3Kim L. Kimmel A.R. Curr. Opin. Genet.

Biol. 2000; 225: 471-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar).The activity of glycogen synthase, the rate-limiting enzyme in glycogen synthesis, is increased by dephosphorylation of at least four serine residues in response to insulin treatment (5Lawrence Jr., J.C. Roach P.J. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 541-547Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Activation of PP1G, a protein phosphatase that can dephosphorylate all the sites in glycogen synthase, is one mechanism used by insulin to increase the activity of the enzyme (6Hubbard M.J. Cohen P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 172-177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar). In addition, a protein kinase cascade has also been identified that appears to play an important role in insulin regulation of glycogen synthase (reviewed in Ref. 1Cohen P. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1999; 354: 485-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Two pharmacological inhibitors of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), wortmannin and LY 294002, block insulin stimulation of glycogen synthase (7Yamamoto-Honda R. Tobe K. Kaburagi Y. Ueki K. Asai S. Yachi M. Shirouzu M. Yodoi J. Akanuma Y. Yokoyama S. Yazaki Y. Kadowaki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2729-2734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), suggesting that PI3K is required for this response. Insulin activation of PI3K and its downstream effector, the protein kinase Akt, induces the phosphorylation and inhibition of GSK-3. GSK-3 phosphorylates glycogen synthase at four sites (3a, 3b, 3c, and 4), provided that site 5 has already been phosphorylated by casein kinase II (1Cohen P. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1999; 354: 485-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 5Lawrence Jr., J.C. Roach P.J. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 541-547Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of sites 3a and 3b has been shown to potently inactivate the enzyme. Labeling studies with 32P have shown that phosphate turnover is relatively rapid in glycogen synthase, so inhibition of GSK-3 activity by the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway could lead to net dephosphorylation of sites 3a and 3b, resulting in increased glycogen synthase activity.Two isoforms of GSK-3 (GSK-3α and GSK-3β) have been identified in mammalian tissues, and both are negatively regulated by insulin (1Cohen P. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1999; 354: 485-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Both isoforms were found to be phosphorylated at a single tyrosine residue in unstimulated cells, and dephosphorylation of GSK-3β with a protein tyrosine phosphatase in vitro inactivates the enzyme (8Hughes K. Nikolakaki E. Plyte S.E. Totty N.F. Woodgett J.R. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 803-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). These results led to the suggestion that insulin inactivates GSK-3 through tyrosine dephosphorylation. However, subsequent studies showed that insulin-induced inhibition of GSK-3 is due to an increase in phosphorylation of Ser-21 in GSK-3α and Ser-9 in GSK-3β (9Cross D.A. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Andjelkovich M. Hemmings B.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 785-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (4326) Google Scholar, 10Shaw M. Cohen P. Alessi D.R.

FEBS Lett. 2000; 469: 111-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), but Akt is thought to be the physiologically relevant kinase in vivo that inactivates GSK-3 in response to insulin. This conclusion is based on the observations that insulin-induced inhibition of GSK-3 is blocked in cells treated with wortmannin or LY 294002 (9Cross D.A. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Andjelkovich M. Hemmings B.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 785-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (4326) Google Scholar, 17Welsh G.I. Foulstone E.J. Young S.W. Tavare J.M. Proud C.G. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 15-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar); coexpression of GSK-3β with wild-type or constitutively active Akt results in the inhibition of GSK-3 activity (10Shaw M. Cohen P. Alessi D.R. FEBS Lett. 1997; 416: 307-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar); expression of a dominant-negative mutant of Akt blocks the effect of insulin on GSK-3β (18van Weeren P.C. de Bruyn K.M. de Vries-Smits A.M. van Lint J. Burgering B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13150-13156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar); and Akt phosphorylates and inactivates both GSK-3 isoforms in vitro(9Cross D.A. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Andjelkovich M. Hemmings B.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 785-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (4326) Google Scholar). In addition, expression of a constitutively active Akt mutant leads to increased glycogen synthase activity only in cells that contain GSK-3 (19Ueki K. Yamamoto-Honda R. Kaburagi Y. Yamauchi T. Tobe K. Burgering B.M. Coffer P.J. Komuro I. Akanuma Y. Yazaki Y. Kadowaki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5315-5322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar).It is well known that catecholamines act through both α- and β-adrenergic receptors to modulate the effects of insulin on glucose metabolism. For example, stimulation of α1-adrenergic receptors in the livers of fed rats inhibits glycogen synthase and promotes gluconeogenesis (20Exton J.H. Harper S.C. Adv. Cyclic Nucleotide Res. 1975; 5: 519-532PubMed Google Scholar). Adrenergic receptors are members of the G protein-coupled receptor family, and three subtypes of the α1-adrenergic receptor (α1A, α1B, and α1D) have been identified by molecular cloning (21Schwinn D.A. Johnston G.I. Page S.O. Mosley M.J. Wilson K.H. Worman N.P. Campbell S. Fidock M.D. Furness L.M. Parry-Smith D.J. Peter B. Bailey D.S. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1995; 272: 134-142PubMed Google Scholar). All three subtypes are widely expressed in a number of tissues and are coupled to α-subunits in the Gq/11 family that are insensitive to inhibition by pertussis toxin (21Schwinn D.A. Johnston G.I. Page S.O. Mosley M.J. Wilson K.H. Worman N.P. Campbell S. Fidock M.D. Furness L.M. Parry-Smith D.J. Peter B. Bailey D.S. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1995; 272: 134-142PubMed Google Scholar, 22Wu D.

Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 784-795PubMed Google Scholar). It is important to note that, in addition to α1-adrenergic receptors, other receptors that couple to Gq/11, including vasopressin, purinergic, and angiotensin II receptors, also inhibit glycogen synthase (24Bouscarel B. Exton J.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 888: 126-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 25Bouscarel B. Meurer K. Decker C. Exton J.H. Biochem. J. 1988; 251: 47-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar).In contrast to what is known about how insulin affects GSK-3 activity, relatively little is known about how Gq-coupled receptors regulate GSK-3 in mammalian cells. In this study, we investigated the regulation of GSK-3β by the α1A-adrenergic receptor stably expressed in Rat-1 fibroblasts. We found that activation of the α1A-adrenergic receptor leads to a modest increase in phosphorylation of GSK-3β at Ser-9 and inhibition of its catalytic activity. However, activation of the α1A-adrenergic receptor does not activate PI3K or Akt (26Ballou L.M. Cross M.E. Huang S. McReynolds E.M. Zhang B.X. Lin R.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4803-4809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), but instead attenuates insulin-induced GSK-3β phosphorylation by inhibiting Akt. These results may explain how catecholamines modulate insulin activation of glycogen synthase.DISCUSSIONThe results presented here demonstrate that the α1A-adrenergic receptor can modulate GSK-3β activity in Rat-1 cells in two ways. One mechanism antagonizes insulin-induced Ser-9 phosphorylation to cause an increase in GSK-3β activity, and the second promotes the phosphorylation of GSK-3β at Ser-9 to cause a decrease in GSK-3β activity.Recent experiments strongly suggest that Akt is the kinase that phosphorylates and inhibits GSK-3 in response to insulin (1Cohen P. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1999; 354: 485-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). We show here that stimulation of the α1A-adrenergic receptor with PE antagonizes insulin activation of Akt (Fig. 1). As a consequence, insulin-induced Ser-9 phosphorylation and inhibition of GSK-3β are also reduced (Figs. 1 and 2). The inhibitory effect of the α1A-adrenergic receptor on insulin signaling to GSK-3β is overcome by expression of constitutively active Akt (Fig.1C) or by mutation of Ser-9 in GSK-3β to Ala (Fig. 2). These results indicate that the effect of the α1A-adrenergic receptor on insulin regulation of GSK-3β is most likely due to inhibition of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. This mechanism could explain the counter-regulatory effect of catecholamines on insulin activation of glycogen synthase. We showed previously that treatment of Rat-1 cells with PE inhibits the activation of PI3K and Akt induced by insulin-like growth factor I and platelet-derived growth factor (26Ballou L.M. Cross M.E. Huang S. McReynolds E.M. Zhang B.X. Lin R.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4803-4809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). We have found that PE also inhibits insulin-induced PI3K activation (data not shown). The mechanism by which the α1A-adrenergic receptor inhibits PI3K activation by these diverse tyrosine kinase receptors is under investigation.Surprisingly, treatment of Rat-1 cells with PE alone induced a modest increase in phosphorylation of GSK-3β and inhibition of its activity (Fig. 3). We suspect that this effect of the α1A-adrenergic receptor on GSK-3 would not result in the activation of glycogen synthase, as catecholamines have been shown to decrease the activity of glycogen synthase in hepatocytes from fasted rats (38Hutson N.J. Brumley F.T. Assimacopoulos F.D. Harper S.C. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 5200-5208Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Presumably, dephosphorylation of glycogen synthase by PP1G could counteract the effect of GSK-3 under these conditions. On the other hand, we cannot rule out the possibility that inhibition of GSK-3 by the α1A-adrenergic receptor could play a role in a cellular process not related to glucose metabolism, such as development. The inhibitory effect of the α1A-adrenergic receptor on GSK-3β activity in Rat-1 cells was abolished using the S9A mutant (Fig. 2), indicating that inhibition is dependent on Ser-9 phosphorylation. Unlike insulin, increased Ser-9 phosphorylation of GSK-3β in response to PE is independent of PI3K/Akt signaling since PE did not activate PI3K or Akt (Fig. 1) (26Ballou L.M. Cross M.E. Huang S. McReynolds E.M. Zhang B.X. Lin R.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4803-4809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), and the effect of PE on GSK-3β phosphorylation was not blocked by LY 294002 (Fig.4A). These results indicate that the signaling pathways used by the tyrosine kinase receptor and the Gq-coupled receptor to regulate GSK-3β activity are distinct.We found that PE-induced phosphorylation of GSK-3β was blocked in the presence of a general PKC inhibitor (Fig. 4B), suggesting that the α1A-adrenergic receptor uses a PKC-dependent pathway to regulate the enzyme. It was shown previously that acute treatment of mouse fibroblasts or A431 cells with PMA inactivates GSK-3 by 40–50% (39Yang S., Yu, J. Wen Z. J. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 56: 550-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 40Cook D. Fry M.J. Hughes K. Sumathipala R. Woodgett J.R. Dale T.C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4526-4536Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar), suggesting that mammalian cells contain a PKC-dependent pathway that can regulate GSK-3. Indeed, several purified recombinant Ca2+-dependent PKCs have been reported to phosphorylate and inhibit GSK-3β in vitro (PKCα = PKCβ1 = PKCγ > PKCβ2) (15Goode N. Hughes K. Woodgett J.R. Parker P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16878-16882Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and transgenic mice that express elevated levels of PKCβ2 in the intestinal epithelium also exhibit decreased GSK-3β activity (41Murray N.R. Davidson L.A. Chapkin R.S. Gustafson W.C. Schattenberg D.G. Fields A.P. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 699-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The PMA-sensitive novel PKCδ has also been reported to phosphorylate GSK-3 (16Tsujio I. Tanaka T. Kudo T. Nishikawa T. Shinozaki K. Grundke-Iqbal I. Iqbal K. Takeda M. FEBS Lett. 2000; 469: 111-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). We found that PMA treatment by itself promoted the phosphorylation of GSK-3β in Rat-1 cells, but Ca2+-dependent PKC isoforms do not appear to be involved in GSK-3β phosphorylation induced by the α1A-adrenergic receptor (Fig. 4, C andD). Instead, our results suggest that activation of a PMA-sensitive novel PKC (Fig. 4C) and the atypical PKCζ (Fig. 5) by the α1A-adrenergic receptor may play a role in signaling to GSK-3β. PKCζ may act directly on GSK-3β in cells, as incubation of GSK-3β (but not the S9A mutant) with PKCζ in vitro has been demonstrated to inhibit GSK-3 kinase activity (42Isagawa T. Mukai H. Oishi K. Taniguchi T. Hasegawa H. Kawamata T. Tanaka C. Ono Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 273: 209-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar).Our results indicate that the signaling pathways used by the insulin and α1A-adrenergic receptors to induce GSK-3β phosphorylation are clearly distinct, as the former depends on PI3K and Akt, whereas the latter does not. The pathways used by some other G protein-coupled receptors to regulate GSK-3 are also different from the one described here for the α1A-adrenergic receptor. For example, agonist binding to the CB1 cannabinoid receptor activates Akt and increases GSK-3α Ser-21 phosphorylation. Treatment of the cells with pertussis toxin or wortmannin blocks the activation of Akt (43Gomez del Pulgar T. Velasco G. Guzman M. Biochem. J. 2000; 347: 369-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar), indicating that signaling is through Gi/Go and PI3K. Other receptors coupled to Gi/Go have also been shown to activate the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway (44Lopez-Ilasaca M. Crespo P. Pellici P.G. Gutkind J.S. Wetzker R. Science. 1997; 275: 394-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar, 45Tilton B. Andjelkovic M. Didichenko S.A. Hemmings B.A. Thelen M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28096-28101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), and one would expect that they would also induce the wortmannin-sensitive phosphorylation of GSK-3. Treatment of Rat-1 cells with isoproterenol, a β-adrenergic receptor agonist, increases the phosphorylation and decreases the activity of both isoforms of GSK-3. Unlike our findings with the α1A-adrenergic receptor (data not shown), the effect of isoproterenol is reversed in the presence of a PKA inhibitor, and PKA has been proposed to directly phosphorylate and inactivate GSK-3 in response to β-adrenergic receptor stimulation (13Fang X., Yu, S.X. Lu Y. Bast R.C. Woodgett J.R. Mills G.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11960-11965Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). By contrast, activation of β3-adrenergic receptors in rat fat cells increases Akt activity and decreases GSK-3 activity in a manner that is independent of cAMP and insensitive to wortmannin or LY 294002 (46Moule S.K.

In the Wg/Wnt signaling pathway in Drosophila and vertebrates, the extracellular Wg/Wnt signal is transduced from the membrane receptor Frizzled through Dsh/Dvl to inactivate GSK-3 (3Kim L.

Dev. 2000; 10: 508-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Stimulation of CAR4 inhibits GSK-3 by an unknown mechanism to promote the pre-stalk cell fate, whereas cAMP binding to CAR3 activates GSK-3 to allow the formation of pre-spore cells. In the latter pathway, CAR3 activates the tyrosine kinase ZAK1, which is thought to phosphorylate and activate GSK-3 (31Kim L. Liu J. Kimmel A.R. Cell. 1999; 99: 399-408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar).Our understanding of the physiological role of GSK-3 has evolved significantly since its identification as an insulin-regulated glycogen synthase kinase. Additional studies to elucidate the signaling pathways used by the α1A-adrenergic receptor and other G protein-coupled receptors to regulate the function of this enzyme will add to our understanding of the complexity of GSK-3 regulation. Glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3)1 is an evolutionarily conserved signaling molecule that plays an important role in diverse biological processes, including metabolism, differentiation, and development. GSK-3 was initially identified as a kinase that phosphorylates glycogen synthase and has been found to play a key role in the regulation of glycogen metabolism in insulin-responsive cells (reviewed in Ref. 1Cohen P. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1999; 354: 485-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). GSK-3 also regulates cell fate determination inDictyostelium and has been intensively studied as a component of the Wg/Wnt signaling pathway in invertebrates and vertebrates that controls development (2Weeks G. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2000; 3: 625-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 3Kim L. Kimmel A.R. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2000; 10: 508-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 4Ferkey D.M. Kimelman D. Dev. Biol. 2000; 225: 471-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The activity of glycogen synthase, the rate-limiting enzyme in glycogen synthesis, is increased by dephosphorylation of at least four serine residues in response to insulin treatment (5Lawrence Jr., J.C. Roach P.J. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 541-547Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Activation of PP1G, a protein phosphatase that can dephosphorylate all the sites in glycogen synthase, is one mechanism used by insulin to increase the activity of the enzyme (6Hubbard M.J. Cohen P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 172-177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar). In addition, a protein kinase cascade has also been identified that appears to play an important role in insulin regulation of glycogen synthase (reviewed in Ref. 1Cohen P. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1999; 354: 485-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Two pharmacological inhibitors of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), wortmannin and LY 294002, block insulin stimulation of glycogen synthase (7Yamamoto-Honda R. Tobe K. Kaburagi Y. Ueki K. Asai S. Yachi M. Shirouzu M. Yodoi J. Akanuma Y. Yokoyama S. Yazaki Y. Kadowaki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2729-2734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), suggesting that PI3K is required for this response. Insulin activation of PI3K and its downstream effector, the protein kinase Akt, induces the phosphorylation and inhibition of GSK-3. GSK-3 phosphorylates glycogen synthase at four sites (3a, 3b, 3c, and 4), provided that site 5 has already been phosphorylated by casein kinase II (1Cohen P. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1999; 354: 485-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 5Lawrence Jr., J.C. Roach P.J. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 541-547Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of sites 3a and 3b has been shown to potently inactivate the enzyme. Labeling studies with 32P have shown that phosphate turnover is relatively rapid in glycogen synthase, so inhibition of GSK-3 activity by the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway could lead to net dephosphorylation of sites 3a and 3b, resulting in increased glycogen synthase activity. Two isoforms of GSK-3 (GSK-3α and GSK-3β) have been identified in mammalian tissues, and both are negatively regulated by insulin (1Cohen P. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1999; 354: 485-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Both isoforms were found to be phosphorylated at a single tyrosine residue in unstimulated cells, and dephosphorylation of GSK-3β with a protein tyrosine phosphatase in vitro inactivates the enzyme (8Hughes K. Nikolakaki E. Plyte S.E. Totty N.F. Woodgett J.R. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 803-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). These results led to the suggestion that insulin inactivates GSK-3 through tyrosine dephosphorylation. However, subsequent studies showed that insulin-induced inhibition of GSK-3 is due to an increase in phosphorylation of Ser-21 in GSK-3α and Ser-9 in GSK-3β (9Cross D.A. Alessi D.R. Cohen P.

We report here that the phosphorylation state of NHERF-1 is profoundly regulated by the cell cycle: NHERF-1 in HeLa cells is hyperphosphorylated in mitosis phase and much less phosphorylated at other points of the cell cycle. This mitosis phase-dependent phosphorylation of NHERF-1 could be blocked by roscovitine, consistent with phosphorylation by cyclin-dependent kinases. In vitro studies with purified NHERF-1 fusion proteins and purified kinases revealed that NHERF-1 was robustly phosphorylated by the cyclin-dependent kinase Cdc2. In contrast, the NHERF-1 relative NHERF-2 was not phosphorylated at all by Cdc2. NHERF-1 possesses two serines (Ser279 and Ser301) that conform to the SP X(K/R) motif preferred for phosphorylation by Cdc2. Mutation of either of these serines reduced Cdc2-mediated phosphorylation of NHERF-1 in vitro, and mutation of both residues together completely abolished Cdc2-mediated phosphorylation. When the S279A/S301A NHERF-1 mutant was expressed in cells, it failed to exhibit the mitosis phase-dependent phosphorylation observed with wild-type NHERF-1. Mutation of both Ser279and Ser301 to aspartate, to mimic Cdc2 phosphorylation of NHERF-1, resulted in a NHERF-1 mutant with a markedly impaired ability to oligomerize in vitro. Similarly, endogenous NHERF-1 from lysates of mitosis phase HeLa cells exhibited a markedly reduced ability to oligomerize relative to endogenous NHERF-1 from lysates of interphase HeLa cells. Mitosis phase NHERF-1 furthermore exhibited the ability to associate with Pin1, a WW domain-containing peptidylprolyl isomerase that does not detectably bind to NHERF-1 in interphase lysates. The association of NHERF-1 with Pin1 facilitated dephosphorylation of NHERF-1, as shown in experiments in which cellular Pin1 activity was blocked by the selective inhibitor juglone. These data reveal that cellular NHERF-1 is phosphorylated during mitosis phase by Cdc2 at Ser279 and Ser301 and that this phosphorylation regulates NHERF-1 oligomerization and association with Pin1.

Most adaptor proteins contain a number of modular interaction domains to facilitate the associations of multiple target proteins (1Pawson T. Scott J.D. Science. 1997; 278: 2075-2080Crossref PubMed Scopus (1881) Google Scholar). One common example of such a module is the PDZ1 domain. PDZ domains can associate with specific carboxyl-terminal motifs on target proteins, and many PDZ domains can also oligomerize with other PDZ domains to enhance the scaffolding or adaptor function of PDZ domain-containing proteins (2Sheng M. Sala C. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 24: 1-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (1029) Google Scholar). Na+/H+ exchanger regulatory factor-1 (NHERF-1) is a PDZ domain-containing protein that was first identified as a cofactor necessary for regulation of Na+/H+exchanger-3 (NHE3) function by phosphorylation (3Weinman E.J. Steplock D. Wang Y. Shenolikar S. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 2143-2149Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Subsequently, NHERF-1 was identified as a binding partner for the actin-associated ERM proteins (ezrin, radixin, moesin, and merlin) and thus is also known as the ERM-binding phosphoprotein of 50 kDa (EBP50) (4Reczek D.

The DNA sequence encoding for amino acids 1–355 of human MAGI-2 (encoding both of the MAGI-2 WW domains) was amplified and inserted into the vector pGEX-4T1 for expression as a GST-tagged fusion protein. All tissue culture media and related reagents were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. HEK-293, HeLa, and ES2 cells were maintained in complete medium (Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium plus 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin) in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C. To express FLAG- and/or hemagglutinin-tagged versions of NHERF-1 or NHERF-1 mutants, 2 μg of total DNA (in a modified version of the vector pBK-CMV from Stratagene) was mixed with LipofectAMINE (15 μl) and Plus reagent (20 μl) (Life Technologies, Inc.) and added to 5 ml of complete medium in 10-cm tissue cultures plates containing cells at ∼50–80% confluency. Following a 4-h incubation, the medium was removed, and 10 ml of fresh complete medium was added. After another 12–16 h, the medium was changed again, and the cells were harvested 24 h later. HeLa cells were synchronized at the G1/S phase boundary using the thymidine-aphidicolin double block method as previously described (33Heintz N. Sive H.L. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1983; 3: 539-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Cells in S phase were obtained 3 h after release from the G1/S phase block. Mitosis and G2 phase cells were obtained following a 14–18 h treatment with nocodazole (50 ng/ml; Sigma) as previously described (34Patel R. Holt M. Philipova R. Moss S. Schulman H. Hidaka H. Whitaker M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7958-7968Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The cell cycle state of the cells harvested following these various protocols was confirmed using flow cytometry. Samples (5 μg/lane) were run on 4–20% SDS-polyacrylamide gels (Novex) for 1 h at 150 V and then transferred to nitrocellulose. The blots were blocked in blot buffer (2% nonfat dry milk, 0.1% Tween 20, 50 mm NaCl, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) for at least 30 min and then incubated with primary antibody in blot buffer for 1 h at room temperature. The blots were washed three times with 10 ml of blot buffer and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in blot buffer. Finally, the blots were washed three more times with 10 ml of blot buffer and visualized via enzyme-linked chemiluminescence using the ECL kit from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. In vitro phosphorylation experiments were carried out at room temperature in a final volume of 25 μl with 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mmMgCl2, and 2 mm EDTA. In this buffer, purified fusion proteins, either His-NHERF-1 (2 μg) or a mutant version of His-NHERF-1, were incubated with purified recombinant human Cdc2/cyclin B (10 units; Calbiochem). Reactions were initiated via the addition of [γ-32P]ATP (1 μCi; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and were allowed to proceed for 30 min at room temperature before being stopped with SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Phosphorylated samples were run on 4–20% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, fixed, dried, and exposed to film. The extent of phosphorylation was quantified by scanning of films and densitometric analysis of bands. GST-NHERF-1 and GST alone were expressed as described above and purified on glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma). The GST fusion proteins were then eluted from the beads using 250 mm reduced glutathione (Sigma) in harvest buffer (10 mm HEPES, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals)). The excess glutathione was removed via multiple rounds of concentration and dilution with fresh harvest buffer. The eluted GST fusion proteins were used to coat the wells of 96-well high affinity binding dishes (Fisher). Each well was coated overnight at 4 °C with 1 μg of fusion protein in a 100-μl final volume of harvest buffer. After the coating solution was removed, the wells were washed twice with harvest buffer and then blocked with blot buffer for 30 min at room temperature. His/S-tagged NHERF-1 fusion proteins diluted in blot buffer were added to the precoated wells at the indicated concentrations and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. The wells were then washed five times with 200 μl of blot buffer. For detection, S protein-alkaline phosphatase conjugate (Novagen) diluted 1:4000 in blot buffer was added to the wells (100 μl/well) and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. The wells were then washed four times with blot buffer and twice with harvest buffer. Following the final wash, each well was incubated with 100 μl of alkaline phosphatase substrate (Bio-Rad), and the absorbance at 405 nm was determined using a Thermomax microplate reader (Molecular Devices) to provide quantitative values for the amount of His-NHERF fusion protein bound to each well. Specific binding is defined as the binding to wells coated with a GST-NHERF-1 fusion protein minus the binding to wells coated with GST alone on the same plate. For GST-NHERF-1 pull-down assays of purified fusion proteins, GST-NHERF-1 fusion proteins and GST alone were purified on glutathione-agarose beads as described above. Aliquots of the fusion protein/bead mixture (50 μl) in 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes were blocked for 30 min with 1 ml of 3% bovine serum albumin blocking buffer (also containing 10 mm HEPES, 50 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20). Equal concentrations of various His-tagged fusion proteins were then incubated with the beads in 1 ml of 3% bovine serum albumin blocking buffer at 4 °C with end-over-end rotation for 1 h. The beads were washed four times with ice-cold 3% bovine serum albumin blocking buffer and twice with harvest buffer. The proteins were eluted from the beads with 1× SDS-PAGE sample buffer, resolved via SDS-PAGE, and transferred to nitrocellulose. The His-tagged fusion proteins were detected via Western blotting with S protein-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (1:4000 dilution; Novagen), and bands were visualized via chemiluminescence as described above. For GST, GST-NHERF-1, GST-Pin1, and GST-MAGI-WW pull-down assays of cell lysates, cells were harvested from 10-cm plates and lysed in 500 μl of ice-cold lysis buffer (10 mm HEPES, 50 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 5 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitor mixture). The lysate was solubilized via end-over-end rotation at 4 °C for 30 min and clarified via centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 15 min. A small fraction of the supernatant was taken at this point and incubated with SDS-PAGE sample buffer to examine expression of proteins in the whole cell extract. The remaining supernatant was incubated with 50 μl of GST, GST-NHERF-1, or GST-Pin1 fusion protein adsorbed onto glutathione-agarose. These incubations were carried out for 2 h with end-over-end rotation at 4 °C. After five washes with 1.0 ml of lysis buffer, the pulled-down proteins were eluted from the beads with 1× SDS-PAGE sample buffer, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and subjected to Western blot analysis with an anti-NHERF-1 (anti-EBP50) antibody (BD Transduction Laboratories). In some cases, the amount of NHERF-1 remaining in the lysate was also quantified using the anti-NHERF-1 antibody to assess the percentage of total cellular NHERF-1 that had been pulled down by the fusion protein. Cells were harvested and lysed in 500 μl of ice-cold lysis buffer. The lysate was solubilized via end-over-end rotation at 4 °C for 30 min and clarified via centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 15 min. A small fraction of the supernatant was taken at this point and incubated with SDS-PAGE sample buffer to examine expression of proteins in the whole cell extract. The remaining supernatant was incubated with 10 μl of anti-Cdc2 antibody (Oncogene Research Products) and 30 μl of protein A/G-agarose (Calbiochem) for 2 h with end-over-end rotation at 4 °C. After five washes with 1.0 ml of lysis buffer, the immunoprecipitated proteins were eluted from the beads with 1× SDS-PAGE sample buffer, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and subjected to Western blot analysis with the anti-NHERF-1 (anti-EBP50) antibody. To examine if the phosphorylation state of NHERF-1 might be regulated during the cell cycle, HeLa cells were synchronized and harvested at different cell cycle time points. Previous studies have shown that phosphorylation of NHERF-1 can significantly increase the apparent size of the NHERF-1 polypeptide on SDS-polyacrylamide gels (4Reczek D. Berryman M. Bretscher A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 169-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar,22Hall R.A. Spurney R.F. Premont R.T. Rahman N. Blitzer J.T. Pitcher J.A. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol.

Thus, NHERF-1 phosphorylation was assessed in these initial studies via Western blotting with the anti-NHERF-1 antibody. As shown in Fig. 1 A, NHERF-1 from mitosis phase cells exhibited an ∼4-kDa increase in apparent size upon SDS-PAGE relative to NHERF-1 from cells in any other stage of the cell cycle. This mitosis phase-dependent shift in NHERF-1 mobility upon SDS-PAGE was completely blocked by treatment of mitosis phase cells with roscovitine, a selective inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinase activity (Fig. 1 B). These findings reveal that endogenous NHERF-1 is phosphorylated by cyclin-dependent kinases during mitosis phase in HeLa cells. Cyclin-dependent kinases typically bind to their substrates with high affinity (35Endicott J.A. Noble M.E.M. Tucker J.A. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1999; 9: 738-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Thus, we next examined whether we could detect a physical complex in cells between NHERF-1 and the cyclin-dependent kinase Cdc2. Cell lysates were prepared from three different cell types (HEK-293, ES2, and HeLa), and endogenous Cdc2 was immunoprecipitated from each lysate using the anti-Cdc2 antibody. Anti-NHERF-1 Western blots of the immunoprecipitates revealed robust co-immunoprecipitation of endogenous NHERF-1 with Cdc2 from all three of the cell lysates examined (Fig.2). These data demonstrate that endogenous NHERF-1 and endogenous Cdc2 physically associate in a variety of cell types. We next performed in vitro phosphorylation assays to examine whether Cdc2 might be able to directly phosphorylate NHERF-1. As shown in Fig. 3 A, incubation of purified Cdc2/cyclin B with purified His-NHERF-1 or His-NHERF-2 fusion proteins in the presence of [32P]ATP resulted in specific phosphorylation of NHERF-1, but not NHERF-2. The normalized levels of the fusion proteins are shown in Fig.3 B. NHERF-1 contains two serine residues (Ser279and Ser301) that roughly conform to the consensus motif (SP X(R/K)) for phosphorylation by Cdc2 (35Endicott J.A. Noble M.E.M. Tucker J.A. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1999; 9: 738-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 36Holmes J.K. Solomon M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25240-25246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). These two serines are not conserved in NHERF-2, and their relative positions within the NHERF-1 polypeptide are schematically illustrated in Fig.3 C. Mutation of Ser279 to an amino acid that cannot be phosphorylated, either alanine or aspartate, resulted in a significant decrease in Cdc2-mediated in vitrophosphorylation of NHERF-1 (Fig. 3, A and B,third lanes). Similarly, mutation of Ser301 also reduced Cdc2-mediated phosphorylation of NHERF-1 (Fig. 3, Aand B, fourth lanes). Mutation of both residues together completely abolished Cdc2-mediated phosphorylation of NHERF-1 (Fig. 3, A and B, fifth lanes), indicating that these two serines are the primary sites at which NHERF-1 is phosphorylated by Cdc2. In addition to preparing the NHERF-1 Ser279/Ser301 mutants as purified fusion proteins, we also prepared these mutants for expression in mammalian cells. As shown in Fig. 4 A, the mitosis phase-induced shift in SDS-PAGE mobility observed with wild-type NHERF-1 was completely blocked by mutation of Ser279 and Ser301 to alanine. This finding suggests that Ser279 and Ser301 are the sites of the mitosis phase-dependent NHERF-1"

The aminopeptidase was partially purified by DEAE-cellulose chromatography and found to be heat stable. The apparent molecular mass of the enzyme was ∼56 kDa; hence, it was designated AP56. Heating (70 °C) of the partially purified aminopeptidase preparations led to the conversion of AP56 to a ∼28-kDa protein (AP28) that retained enzyme activity, a reaction that depended on elastase (LasB). The pH optimum for Leu-pNA hydrolysis by AP28 was 8.5. This activity was inhibited by Zn chelators but not by inhibitors of serine- or thiol-proteases, suggesting that AP28 is a Zn-dependent enzyme. Of several amino acid p-nitroanilide derivatives examined, Leu-pNA was the preferred substrate. The sequences of the first 20 residues of AP56 and AP28 were determined. A search of the P. aeruginosa genomic data base revealed a perfect match of these sequences with positions 39–58 and 273–291, respectively, in a 536-amino acid residue open reading frame predicted to encode an aminopeptidase. A search for sequence similarities with other proteins revealed 52% identity with Streptomyces griseusaminopeptidase, ∼35% identity with Saccharomyces cerevisiae aminopeptidase Y and a hypothetical aminopeptidase from Bacillus subtilis, and 29–32% with Aeromonas caviae, Vibrio proteolyticus, and Vibrio cholerae aminopeptidases. The residues potentially involved in zinc coordination were conserved in all these proteins. Thus, P. aeruginosa aminopeptidase may belong to the same family (M28) of metalloproteases.

Vibrio proteolyticus aminopeptidase Streptomyces griseus Aeromonas caviae Pseudomonas aeruginosa polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis yeast aminopeptidase Y Vibrio cholerae benzyl-oxycarbonyl Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen commonly associated with infections in patients suffering from cystic fibrosis, extensive skin burns, or suppressed immunity (1Pollack M. Gorbach S.L. Blacklow N.R. Infectious Diseases. W. B. Saunders, Co., Philadelphia, PA1998: 1824-1837Google Scholar). Virulence of P. aeruginosa is largely related to its ability to secrete into the environment a variety of toxic and degradative enzymes. Most notable in this regard are several proteases that can cause extensive tissue damage, interfere with host defenses, and promote bacterial propagation and invasion during infection. Of the four endopeptidases known to be secreted by P. aeruginosa, elastase (also termed pseudolysin; encoded by lasB) is a leading virulence factor (2Kessler E. Ohman D.E. Barrett A.J. Rawlings N.D. Woessner J.F. Handbook of Proteolytic Enzymes. Academic Press, London1998: 1058-1064Google Scholar, 3Morihara K.

It cleaves preferentially peptide bonds on the amino side of hydrophobic residues and can degrade numerous host proteins in addition to elastin (3Morihara K. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 248: 242-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In many P. aeruginosa strains, elastase is also the major secreted protein. Alkaline proteinase (aeruginolysin) (5Morihara K. Barrett A.J. Rawlings N.D. Woessner J.F. Handbook of Proteolytic Enzymes. Academic Press, London1998: 1150-1152Google Scholar), another endopeptidase secreted by P. aeruginosa, can cleave a wide range of peptide bonds but its specific activity against proteins such as casein is 10-fold lower than that of elastase, and it has no elastinolytic activity (4Morihara K.

The fourth endopeptidase secreted by P. aeruginosa (lysine-specific endopeptidase; protease IV) cleaves peptide bonds on the carboxyl side of lysine residues in peptides and proteins and can act on a number of host proteins including complement components, IgG, and fibrinogen (13Elliot B.W.

Microbiol. 1995; 16: 263-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), is apparently not a protease but may function as a chitin-binding protein (17Folders J. Tommassen J. van Loon L.C. Bitter W. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 1257-1263Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). One of the roles of bacterial extracellular proteases is provision of readily available nutrients required for rapid bacterial growth (18Maeda H. Yamamoto T. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1996; 377: 217-226PubMed Google Scholar). Small peptides and free amino acids released by the proteases from proteins in the environment can be taken up by the bacteria and utilized as a source of both carbon and nitrogen (19Van Delden C. Pesci E.C. Pearson J.P. Iglewski B.H. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 4499-4502Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The action of secreted endopeptidases, proteases that cleave internal peptide bonds, is complemented by exopeptidases such as amino- or carboxypeptidases that can release single amino acids from the respective ends of peptides and proteins. Bacterial aminopeptidases may be located in the cytoplasm, periplasm, on membranes, associated with the cell envelope, or secreted into the environment (for review see Ref. 20Gonzales T. Robert-Baudouy J. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1996; 18: 319-344Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Of the secreted aminopeptidases, those produced by Vibrio proteolyticus (formerly Aeromonas proteolytica) and Streptomyces griseus (designated below as VpAP1 and SgAP, respectively), have been studied thoroughly (21Awad Jr., W.M. Barrett A.J. Rawlings N.D. Woessner J.F. Handbook of Proteolytic Enzymes. Academic Press, London1998: 1431-1432Google Scholar, 22Chevrier B. D'Orchymont H. Barrett A.J Rawlings N.D. Woessner J.F.

Both belong to the same family (M28) of Zn-dependent proteolytic enzymes with co-catalytic metal centers (23Rawlings N.D. Barrett A.J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 248: 183-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar). Unlike most intracellular aminopeptidases which form oligomeric structures (20Gonzales T. Robert-Baudouy J. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1996; 18: 319-344Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Taylor A. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 290-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar), VpAP and SgAP appear to act as monomers of about 30 kDa molecular mass. VpAP and SgAP are also distinguished by their heat (70 °C) stability (25Prescott J.M. Wilkes S.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1966; 117: 328-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 26Spungin A.

The substrate specificity of VpAP and SgAP is similar, both cleaving preferentially hydrophobic amino acids especially leucine occupying the N-terminal position of proteins or peptides (25Prescott J.M. Wilkes S.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1966; 117: 328-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 28Ben-Meir D. Spungin A. Ashkenazi R. Blumberg S. Eur. J.

Although the amino acid sequences of VpAP and SgAP show relatively low homology (∼29% identity) their three-dimensional structures are almost superimposable (30Greenblatt H.M. Almog O. Maras B,. Spungin-Bialik A. Barra D. Blumberg S. Shoham G. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 265: 620-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Both contain two adjacent zinc atoms in their active sites that are required for activity, and the five amino acid residues involved in coordination of the two active site zinc atoms (two His, two Asp, and one Glu) are identical in the two enzymes and overlap closely (30Greenblatt H.M.

The gene coding for VpAP (but not SgAP) has been cloned (31Guenet C. Lepage P. Harris B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8390-8395Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Van Heeke G. Denslow S. Watkins J.R. Wilson K.J. Wagner F.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1131: 337-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The deduced amino acid sequence indicated that VpAP is produced as a pre-proenzyme containing a signal peptide (21 amino acid residues), an N-terminal propeptide (81 residues), a mature domain of 299 residues, and a C-terminal propeptide (100 residues) (32Van Heeke G. Denslow S. Watkins J.R. Wilson K.J. Wagner F.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1131: 337-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Expression studies suggested that VpAP is secreted as an active thermosensitive 43-kDa protein that is readily transformed to two thermostable forms, each of ∼30 kDa in size (31Guenet C. Lepage P. Harris B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8390-8395Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, genes coding for aminopeptidases secreted by Vibrio cholerae(33Toma C. Honma Y. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 4495-4500Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and Aeromonas caviae (34Izawa N. Hayashi K. J. Ferment. Bioengineer. 1996; 82: 544-548Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar) have also been cloned, and their deduced amino acid sequences revealed that both are translated as preproenzymes and show high homology to VpAP. Unlike VpAP, however, the A. caviae aminopeptidase (AcAP) lacks a C-terminal propeptide domain. The N-terminal propeptides of both AcAP and VpAP were found to be required for correct folding of their respective enzymes, and they also possess inhibitory activity (35Nirasawa S. Nakajima Y.

Biochem. 2001; 65: 420-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). The aminopeptidase of AcAP has been isolated (38Izawa N. Ishikawa S. Tanokura T. Ohta K. Hayashi K. J. Agr. Food Chem. 1997; 45: 4897-4902Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and found to share many of its properties with VpAP and SgAP. Here we describe for the first time an extracellular aminopeptidase of P. aeruginosa (PaAP) and show that an active 56-kDa form of the enzyme (designated AP56) can be converted to an active form of ∼28 kDa molecular mass (AP28) with properties similar to those of SgAP, VpAP, and AcAP. Based on the N-terminal sequences determined for AP56 and AP28 we identified the gene coding for PaAP. The deduced amino acid sequence of the respective translation product revealed that the active 28-kDa domain corresponds to the C-terminal portion of AP56 and shares high homology with those of SgAP and related aminopeptidases, placing PaAP in the same family of co-catalytic Zn-dependent metallopeptidases. P. aeruginosa strains used in this study include wild type strains Habs serotype 1, FRD2, and PAO1 and mutant derivatives of the latter two strains, FRD2128 (lasAΔ) (39Goldberg J.B. Ohman D.E. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 4532-4539Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), FRD740 (lasBΔ) (40McIver K.S. Kessler E. Olson J.C. Ohman D.E. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 18: 877-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), and PAO-E64 (lasA1), a temperature-sensitive lasA mutant of strain PAO1 (41Ohman D.E. Cryz S.J. Iglewski B.H. J. Bacteriol. 1980; 142: 836-842Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were grown at 37 °C with aeration for 18 h in tryptic soy broth without dextrose (Difco). The aminopeptidase was purified from 400 to 800 ml of the bacterial culture filtrate. The cells were removed by centrifugation, and proteins in the supernatant were precipitated with ammonium sulfate (Ultrapure, SchwartzMann; 80% saturation). The precipitate was collected by centrifugation (20,000 g; 1 h), dissolved in 0.02 mTris-HCl, 0.5 mm CaCl2, pH 8.3 (Buffer A), and dialyzed extensively against the same buffer. The dialyzed solutions (40–75 ml) were further concentrated with Aquacide II (Calbiochem), and 10–15-ml samples containing ∼100 mg of protein were subjected to DEAE-cellulose (Whatman DE 52) chromatography. The column (2.1 × 27 cm) was equilibrated and washed with buffer A at a flow rate of 20 ml/h. 3-ml fractions were collected. Adsorbed proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of NaCl (0–0.6 m; 540 ml) in buffer A. All procedures were conducted at 4 °C. Aminopeptidase activity was determined spectrophotometrically with Leu-p-nitroanilide (Sigma; 0.6 mm in 1 ml of 0.05 m Tris-HCl, 1 mmCaCl2, pH 8.3) by continuously following the increase in absorbance at 405 nm due to the release of p-nitroaniline. In assays with inhibitors, the enzyme was preincubated with the inhibitor for 30 or 90 min, as indicated in the legend to Table I. One unit of activity is the amount of enzyme that causes an increase in optical density at 405 nm of 1 unit/h. Enzyme input was in the range of 0.1–3 units.Table IInhibitors of AP28InhibitorConcentrationActivitymm%none1001,10-phenanthroline0.504,7-phenanthroline0.5951,7-phenanthroline0.593TEP10EDTA1-aPreincubation time was 90 min.1060EGTA1-aPreincubation time was 90 min.1048DTT0.50Phosphoramidon0.1100TLCK5100DFP5100PMSF0.4100DCI0.5107NEM595AP28 (1.5 μg) was preincubated with the inhibitor for 30 min at room temperature, and the activity was then determined with Leu-p-nitroanilide as detailed under “Experiment Procedures.” TEP, tetraethylene pentamine; DTT, dithiothreitol; EDTA, ethylenediamine tetraacetate; TLCK, tosyl-lysine chloromethylketone; DFP, diisopropylfluorophosphate; PMSF, phenylmethyl-sulfonyl fluoride; DCI, 3,4-dichloroisocoumarin; NEM, N-ethylmaleimide.1-a Preincubation time was 90 min.

Elastinolytic activity was determined with elastin-Congo Red (Sigma) as the substrate. Reaction suspensions containing 5 mg of elastin-Congo Red in 1.1 ml of 0.05 m Tris-HCl, 0.5 mmCaCl2, pH 7.5, (buffer B) and 0.03–0.45 enzyme units, were incubated with shaking at 37 °C for 2 h. The reactions were stopped by adding 0.1 ml of 0.12 m EDTA, followed by centrifugation and measurement of absorbance at 495 nm of the clear supernatants. One unit of activity is the amount of enzyme that causes an optical density increase at 495 nm of 1 unit/h. Proteolytic activity was determined by an azocasein assay (42Kessler E. Safrin M. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 1215-1219Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Enzyme (0.0005–0.03 units) was added to 1 ml of 0.3% azocasein (Sigma) in buffer B and incubated at 37 °C for 15 to 30 min. Reactions were stopped by adding trichloroacetic acid (10%, 0.5 ml), followed by centrifugation and measurement of absorbance at 400 nm of the clear supernatants. One unit of activity is the amount of enzyme that causes an increase in optical density at 400 nm of 1 unit/min. SDS-PAGE was performed according to Laemmli (43Laemmli U.K. Nature (London). 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) with 4% stacking gels and 12% separating gels. All samples were incubated with 1,10-phenanthroline before exposure to SDS (42Kessler E. Safrin M. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 1215-1219Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Protein bands were detected by silver staining (44Oakley B.R. Kirsch D.R. Morris N.R. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 105: 361-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (2450) Google Scholar). Electrophoretic transfer of proteins from the gels to nitrocellulose was performed in 48 mm Tris, 39 mm glycine, 20% methanol, and 1.3 mm SDS, pH 9.2. The membranes were blocked with 5% skimmed milk (Difco), followed by incubation with rabbit serum (diluted 1:50) against the 28-kDa form of the enzyme (AP28). Aminopeptidase-related protein bands were visualized with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Sigma) (45Blake M.S. Johnston K.H. Russel-Jones G.J. Gotschlich E.C. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 136: 175-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (1631) Google Scholar). AP28 was generated by heating (70 °C; 1 h) a DEAE-cellulose-purified AP56fraction from strain FRD2128 (Fig. 2). The heated fraction was subjected to SDS-PAGE, and regions containing AP28 were excised from the gel and suspended in phosphate-buffered saline. Rabbits were immunized by sub-cutaneous injections of the suspension. Approximately 40 μg of AP28 were administered in the first injection, followed by repeated injections (5 times, 20–30 μg each) given at 10-day intervals. Rabbits were bled ∼10 days after the last injection. Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Bradford (46Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). The Bradford reagent was from Bio-Rad, and bovine serum albumin served as a standard. Proteins were separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and electrotransferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon-P; Millipore Corp.) as previously described (9Kessler E. Safrin M,. Abrams W.R. Rosenbloom J. Ohman D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9884-9889Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). After staining with Coomassie Blue, protein bands of interest were excised from the membrane, and N-terminal sequences were determined by automated Edman degradation on an Applied Biosystems 490 protein sequencing system. Examination of culture filtrates of P. aeruginosa wild type strains Habs serotype 1, FRD2, and PA01 for aminopeptidase activity revealed that all culture filtrates contained Leu-p-nitroanilide hydrolyzing activity. This suggested that all three strains secrete an aminopeptidase(s) into their environment. The specific activity of the putative aminopeptidase (1.5–4 units/mg protein) was comparable among these strains. Similar specific activity values (2.2–3 units/mg protein) were obtained for culture filtrates from the mutant strains FRD2128, FRD740, and PAO-E64, indicating that aminopeptidase production is independent of either elastase or LasA protease production. To examine whether the aminopeptidase is thermostable, the concentrated culture filtrates from strains FRD2, FRD740, and FRD2128 (wild type, ΔlasB and ΔlasA, respectively) were each incubated at 70 °C for 1–3 h, conditions that have been used in the past to demonstrate the heat stability of enzymes such as SgAP and VpAP (25Prescott J.M. Wilkes S.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1966; 117: 328-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 26Spungin A. Blumberg S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 183: 471-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Heating for up to 3 h had virtually no effect on the aminopeptidase activity, indicating that PaAP is resistant to heat. As a first step toward identification of the aminopeptidase, the concentrated culture filtrate of the elastase-negative P. aeruginosa strain FRD740 and that of strain FRD2128 that does not express LasA protease were each chromatographed on a DEAE-cellulose column, equilibrated, and washed with 0.02 m Tris-HCl, 0.5 mm CaCl2, pH 8.3, (buffer A). Adsorbed proteins were eluted from the column with a linear gradient of NaCl (0–0.6 m) in the same buffer (see “Experimental Procedures”). All fractions were examined for aminopeptidase as well as elastinolytic and proteolytic activities. Fig. 1 shows that, with both strains, the aminopeptidase activity adsorbed to the column and was eluted from it as a single peak between 0.2 and 0.3 m NaCl (7–11 mmho). The active peak was followed by a peak of absorbance at 280 nm (fractions 275–325) that contained brown material but, as revealed by SDS-PAGE analysis, showed no detectable protein bands (data not shown). Elastase in the culture filtrate of strain FRD2128 adsorbed to the column and was eluted from it between 0.1 and 0.2 m NaCl (3–6 mmho), in a peak preceding that of the aminopeptidase (Fig.1 A). The recovery of the aminopeptidase activity after chromatography was 60–70%. SDS-PAGE analysis of the aminopeptidase containing fractions from strains FRD2128 and FRD740 revealed that both contained a protein with an apparent molecular mass of ∼56 kDa (designated AP56) as the major constituent (Fig. 2,left panel, lanes 2 and 5). The aminopeptidase fraction from strain FRD2128 (but not FRD740) also contained a small amount of elastase (Fig. 2, left panel, compare lanes 2 and 5). This was also reflected in assays of elastinolytic activity showing basal levels of elastinolytic activity in the ascending part of the aminopeptidase peak (Fig. 1 A). Heating (70 °C, 1 h) of the DEAE-cellulose-purified aminopeptidase fraction from strain FRD2128 but not FRD740 led to the disappearance of AP56 (as well as elastase and other contaminating proteins) and a concomitant appearance of a new band migrating as a protein of about 28 kDa (AP28; Fig. 2, compare lanes 2 and 3 with 5 and 6 in left panel). While heating had virtually no effect on the aminopeptidase activity, it reduced the elastinolytic and proteolytic activities (strain FRD2128) by at least 90%. Immunoblotting analysis revealed that antibodies to AP28 recognized both AP28 and AP56(Fig. 2, right panel). This immunological cross-reactivity and the finding that the heated enzyme fraction from strain FRD2128 (which contained AP28 as the only component) was as active as the unheated fraction, both suggested that AP56 and AP28 represent two active forms of PaAP. Apparently, AP56 corresponds to the secreted form of the enzyme, whereas AP28 is generated from it upon heating, a process that appears to depend on elastase. Observations made with the culture filtrate from the wild type strain, FRD2, were consistent with this conclusion. By immunoblotting analysis (data not shown), the crude culture filtrate from strain FRD2 as well as the aminopeptidase-enriched fraction obtained from it after DEAE-cellulose chromatography contained AP56 but not AP28. Furthermore, heating of the partially purified fraction led to a complete disappearance of AP56 and concomitant appearance of AP28 without effect on the aminopeptidase activity. To demonstrate that elastase indeed plays a role in the conversion of AP56 to AP28, a sample of the DEAE-cellulose-purified aminopeptidase fraction from strain FRD2128, which contained some elastase, was heated to 70 °C with or without addition of the elastase inhibitor phosphoramidon. Immunoblotting analyses of the incubation solutions revealed that phosphoramidon completely blocked the conversion of AP56 to AP28 (Fig. 3 A, compare lanes 2 and 3), supporting a role for elastase in the conversion of AP56 to its 28-kDa form. In another experiment, the DEAE-cellulose-purified aminopeptidase fraction from strain FRD740 (lacking elastase) was heated in the absence or presence of exogenously added elastase, and the reaction solutions were analyzed by immunoblotting. As shown in Fig. 3 B, at 70 °C the addition of 0.15 μg of elastase was sufficient to fully convert AP56 to AP28 (lane 7). The same result was obtained when heating was performed in the presence of 3 μg of elastase (Fig. 3 B, lane 6). Heating in the absence of elastase had no effect on either intensity or migration position of AP56 (Fig. 3 B, lane 5). When incubated at 37 °C with either 0.15 or 3 μg of elastase, however, conversion of AP56 to its smaller form did not take place (Fig. 3 B, lanes 4 and 3, respectively). This suggested that partial proteolysis of AP56 by elastase might depend on a conformational change within AP56, likely to occur at elevated temperatures. Consistent with this, when the partially purified AP56fraction from strain FRD740 was incubated with elastase at various temperatures ranging from 37 °C to 70 °C, we found that the lowest temperature at which the conversion of AP56 to AP28 took place was 55 °C (data not shown). To gain some insight on the enzymatic properties of PaAP, we studied the pH dependence, sensitivity to inhibitors, and cleavage preference of AP28. The effect of pH and those of various protease inhibitors on the activity of AP28 were examined with Leu-p-nitroanilide as the substrate. Hydrolysis was evident in the pH range of 7–9.5 with maximal activity observed at pH 8.5 (data not shown). As shown in TableI, the activity of AP28 was completely inhibited in the presence of dithiothreitol and Zn chelators such as tetraethylene pentamine and 1,10-phenanthroline. 4,7- and 1,7-phenanthroline, two non-chelating isomers of 1,10-phenanthroline, were not inhibitory. AP28 was also inhibited by EDTA and EGTA, but as opposed to 1,10-phenanthroline inhibition was partial and required both higher inhibitor concentrations and longer exposure times. Thus, at 10 mm 50–60% inhibition was exerted by these chelators after 90 min of incubation. AP28 was insensitive to serine-proteases inhibitors such as diisopropyl fluorophosphate, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 3,4-dichloroisocoumarin, and tosyl-lysine chloromethylketone.N-ethylmaleimide, an inhibitor of cysteine proteinases, and the elastase specific inhibitor, phosphoramidon, had no effect on the activity of AP28. Together, these results strongly suggest that P. aeruginosa aminopeptidase is a Zn-dependent metallopeptidase. To ascertain that the activity of PaAP requires a free N-terminal amino group, a property that defines aminopeptidases, we"

Several proteins have been identified that play critical roles in guiding axons along their stereotypical pathways, including members of the ephrin, Netrin, Semaphorin, and Slit protein families. Several classes of transmembrane receptors for these various guidance cues have been identified and characterized (see Refs. 1Tessier-Lavigne M. Goodman C.S. Science. 1996; 274: 1123-1133Crossref PubMed Scopus (2674) Google Scholar and 2Mueller B.K. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1999; 22: 351-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar for reviews). In the case of the netrins, there are two known classes of receptors, the deleted in colorectal cancer (DCC)1 and UNC-5 families. The DCC family receptors (UNC-40, Frazzled, or DCC inCaenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila, and mammals, respectively) are required for the attraction of growth cones by netrins in vitro. Loss of function mutations in the corresponding genes result in misrouting of axons that are normally attracted to a netrin source in vivo (3Chan S.S. Zheng H. Su M.W. Wilk R. Killeen M.T.

The UNC-5 family receptors, regarded as co-receptors of DCC, are required for the repulsive effect of the netrins. In C. elegans, the loss of UNC-5 function in neurons that normally project away from an UNC-6/netrin source results in misrouting similar to that observed inunc-6 mutants. Ectopic expression of UNC-5 in neurons that normally fail to respond to UNC-6 netrin causes their axons to be directed away from the source in an UNC-40 dependent manner (7Leung-Hagesteijn C.

InXenopus spinal cord neurons, DCC mediated attraction to netrin was converted to repulsion by expression of UNC-5 in these cells (12Hong K. Hinck L. Nishiyama M. Poo M.M. Tessier-Lavigne M. Stein E. Cell. 1999; 97: 927-941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). However, some evidence suggests that the relationship of netrin mediated attraction and repulsion might be more complex. For example,unc-40 loss of function mutations in C. elegansimpair neurite migrations away from the UNC-6/netrin source to a lesser extent than loss of function mutations in unc-5, indicating UNC-5 receptors may mediate their own UNC-40 independent repulsive response to UNC-6/netrin (9Hedgecock E.M. Culotti J.G. Hall D.H. Neuron. 1990; 4: 61-85Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Frazzled (the UNC-40/DCCDrosophila ortholog) is required for netrin mediated attraction, but not repulsion, suggesting the possible existence of additional netrin receptors in Drosophila (13Winberg M.L.

Their extracellular regions contain two immunoglobulin (Ig) and two thrombospondin type 1 domains, followed by a single transmembrane segment. Within their cytoplasmic regions they possess a juxtamembrane sequence, followed by a conserved ZU-5 domain (homologous to a portion of zona occludens-1; (16Itoh M. Nagafuchi A. Moroi S. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 181-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar)) and a C-terminal death domain (DD) (17Hofmann K. Tschopp J. FEBS Lett. 1995; 371: 321-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). A DCC binding motif was recently located between the ZU-5 and DD domain of UNC5H2 (12Hong K. Hinck L. Nishiyama M. Poo M.M.

Poo M.M. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1999; 9: 355-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). So far, the immediate downstream signaling molecules for the DCC and UNC-5 receptors are unknown. In C. elegans, suppressors of growth cone steering induced by ectopic UNC-5 include four new genes as well as four genes previously known to be required for axon guidance,unc-6, unc40, unc-44, and unc-34 (11Colavita A. Culotti J.G. Dev. Biol. 1998; 194: 72-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Interestingly, unc-44 encodes an ankyrin-related protein, thus providing a possible physical link between UNC-5 and the cytoskeleton. Homologs of UNC-34, Mena and ena, are profilin-binding proteins required for axon guidance in mice and Drosophila, respectively (20Lanier L.M. Gates M.A. Witke W. Menzies A.S. Wehman A.M.

We demonstrate that UNC-5 receptors are tyrosine phosphorylated in vivo and this tyrosine phosphorylation can be enhanced by netrin ligand. One phosphorylation site in the ZU-5 domain is identified and shown to bind with the Shp2 tyrosine phosphatase in vitro and in vivo.DISCUSSIONTyrosine kinases were originally identified through their ability to affect cell growth and differentiation, but more recent data have also implicated phosphotyrosine signaling in the control of guided cell movements and thus in the formation of complex tissues such as the nervous system (2Mueller B.K. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1999; 22: 351-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar, 31Holland S.J. Peles E. Pawson T. Schlessinger J. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1998; 8: 117-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 35Pawson T. Nash P. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1027-1047PubMed Google Scholar). Notably, Eph receptors, which form the largest family of vertebrate receptor tyrosine kinases, control events such as axon guidance and topographic map formation in the mammalian central nervous system, as well as guiding the movements of neural crest cells and the interactions of cells that form the cardiovascular system (36Klein R. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: R691-694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 37Wilkinson D.G. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 155-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the C. elegans Eph receptor VAB-1 regulates morphogenetic cell movements (38George S.E. Simokat K. Hardin J. Chisholm A.D. Cell. 1998; 92: 633-643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 39Wang X. Roy P.J. Holland S.J. Zhang L.W. Culotti J.G. Pawson T. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 903-913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Eph receptor signaling re-organizes the actin cytoskeleton, and can result in the collapse of axonal growth cones, and thus in the repulsion of Eph receptor-expressing cells from cells that display relevant ligands (ephrins) on their surface. Although the physiological cytoplasmic targets of Eph receptors remain uncertain, activated Eph receptors, in common with other receptor tyrosine kinases, can directly bind specific SH2 domain proteins and can also phosphorylate the p62dok-1 scaffolding protein, which in turn binds SH2 proteins such as p120-RasGAP, Nck, and Shp2 (26Holland S.J. Gale N.W. Gish G.D. Roth R.A. Songyang Z. Cantley L.C. Henkemeyer M. Yancopoulos G.D. Pawson T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3877-3888Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 40Miao H. Burnett E. Kinch M.

Chem. 1998; 273: 1303-1308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Such data have strongly implicated tyrosine phosphorylation as playing a significant role in directed cell movements and axon guidance.In addition to receptors with intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity, a large number of receptors lack covalently linked catalytic domains, but nonetheless associate with tyrosine kinases and require tyrosine phosphorylation to engage SH2 domain proteins and transmit intracellular signals. Cytokine receptors, for example, interact with cytoplasmic Jak tyrosine kinases, which phosphorylate the activated receptor, thereby creating binding sites for the SH2 domains of Stat transcription factors (42Imada K. Leonard W.J. Mol. Immunol. 2000; 37: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). Recent data indicate that a number of guidance receptors, although lacking any intrinsic kinase activity, may nonetheless serve as substrates for tyrosine kinases and be regulated by tyrosine phosphorylation. The Drosophila Roundabout (Robo) receptor, which mediates the repulsive effects of the Slit ligand on axonal crossing of the mid-line, can be phosphorylated on multiple tyrosine residues by the Abl tyrosine kinase (18Bashaw G.J. Goodman C.S. Cell. 1999; 97: 917-926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Substitution of one of the conserved tyrosine phosphorylation sites (in the CC1 Robo motif) creates a hyperactive Robo receptor (18Bashaw G.J. Goodman C.S. Cell. 1999; 97: 917-926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), suggesting that one role of tyrosine phosphorylation is to attenuate the strength of Robo signaling. In a similar vein, theDrosophila Dscam receptor is tyrosine phosphorylated and binds the SH2 domain of the Nck (Dock) SH2/SH3 adaptor in a fashion that appears important for the pathfinding of Bolwig's nerve (43Schmucker D. Clemens J.C. Shu H. Worby C.A. Xiao J. Muda M. Dixon J.E. Zipursky S.L. Cell. 2000; 101: 671-684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar). In addition, plexins, receptors which mediate the effects of the semaphorin guidance cues, become tyrosine phosphorylated in cells (32Tamagnone L. Artigiani S. Chen H. He Z. Ming G.I. Song H. Chedotal A. Winberg M.L. Goodman C.S. Poo M. Tessier-Lavigne M. Comoglio P.M. Cell. 1999; 99: 71-80Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (932) Google Scholar). Although the semaphorins contain an extended and conserved “SP” cytoplasmic signaling domain, they lack intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity, suggesting that their phosphorylation results from an associated tyrosine kinase.The importance of tyrosine phosphorylation in axon guidance in vertebrates is underscored by the finding that receptor-like tyrosine phosphatases are important in several aspects of neuronal development, ranging from cell fate determination to axon guidance and fasciculation (31Holland S.J. Peles E. Pawson T. Schlessinger J. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1998; 8: 117-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 44Van Vactor D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 174-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 45Van Vactor D. O'Reilly A.M. Neel B.G. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 112-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Thus, genetic analysis in Drosophila has revealed that two receptor-like tyrosine phosphatases (DPTP10d and DPTP69D) are positive regulators of Slit/Robo repulsive signaling (46Sun Q. Bahri S. Schmid A. Chia W. Zinn K. Development. 2000; 127: 801-812PubMed Google Scholar). Our results show that members of the UNC-5 family of guidance receptors are also targets for tyrosine phosphorylation in vivo.Tyrosine Phosphorylation of UNC-5/RCM in Vivo and in VitroAlthough they have been intensively studied at the genetic level, little is known about the biochemical signaling pathways activated by the netrin receptors UNC-40/DCC and UNC-5, nor is there any information concerning their phosphorylation beyond the fact that they lack obvious kinase domains. We find that the netrin-1 receptors, UNC-5 and UNC-40, are both phosphorylated on tyrosine in C. elegans and that the tyrosine phosphorylation of UNC-5 in vivo is partially dependent on UNC-6/netrin. Intriguingly, UNC-5 appears to have multiple tyrosine phosphorylation sites and it is therefore possible that the partial tyrosine phosphorylation of UNC-5 observed in an unc-6 null mutant of C. elegans(Fig. 2A) is due to different phosphorylation sites having a variable dependence on netrin stimulation. Although, as far as is known, all the functions of UNC-5 depend on UNC-6, it is also possible that other ligands exist for UNC-5 that regulate its ability to respond to UNC-6. A possible candidate for another UNC-5 ligand is UNC-129, (47Colavita A. Krishna S. Zheng H. Padgett R.W. Culotti J.G. Science. 1998; 281: 706-709Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a family member of TGF-β that is also required to guide pioneer motor axons along the dorsoventral axis of C. elegans. Mutations in unc-129 suppress ectopicunc-5-induced growth cone guidance (11Colavita A. Culotti J.G. Dev. Biol. 1998; 194: 72-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). UNC-129 does not appear to act through a conventional transforming growth factor-β receptor (47Colavita A. Krishna S. Zheng H. Padgett R.W. Culotti J.G. Science. 1998; 281: 706-709Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and is therefore a potential ligand for UNC-5. As such, UNC-129 could modulate UNC-5 phosphorylation, possibly by altering its sensitivity to UNC-6. These ideas are now being examined experimentally.Of relevance to the function of UNC-5 tyrosine phosphorylation, work by Killeen et al.2 indicates that deletion mutants with decreased tyrosine phosphorylation show a corresponding reduced ability to rescue unc-5 null mutants of C. elegans. These results suggest that tyrosine phosphorylation is a hallmark of fully active UNC-5 and raise the possibility that tyrosine phosphorylation is important for UNC-5 function in vivo. Another indication that UNC-5 tyrosine phosphorylation may be physiologically relevant is the finding that mammalian RCM is tyrosine phosphorylated in the embryonic mouse brain, suggesting that this UNC-5 modification is conserved in evolution. In HEK-293 transfected cells, RCM is weakly phosphorylated after netrin stimulation (Fig.2B), although both the basal and netrin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation is greatly enhanced by the co-expression of an activated Src tyrosine kinase. There are several possible explanations for the rather modest RCM tyrosine phosphorylation in HEK-293 cells prior to v-Src expression. Netrin function may be regulated in vivo by a co-activator (48Kennedy T.E. Serafini T. de la Torre J.R. Tessier-Lavigne M. Cell. 1994; 78: 425-435Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1121) Google Scholar) such as netrin synergizing activity (49Galko M.J. Tessier-Lavigne M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7832-7838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) (or even an UNC-129 homologue), which may not be present in our cell culture experiments or RCM phosphorylation may normally be regulated by a tyrosine kinase which is not fully expressed or activated in HEK-293 cells. The identity of the tyrosine kinase that phosphorylates UNC-5 in vivo remains to be established. Regardless, the finding that UNC-5 and RCM contain phosphotyrosine inC. elegans and the mouse embryo, respectively, shows that their phosphorylation is a physiological event.To identify specific UNC-5 phosphorylation sites, we screened several tyrosine point mutations and carried out phosphopeptide mapping of bacterially expressed proteins using nano-ESI-MS/MS. These approaches revealed that a conserved tyrosine within the ZU-5 domain (Tyr568) is one of the potential tyrosine phosphorylation sites in RCM.Phosphorylation of RCM Tyr568 Creates an SH2 Domain Docking SiteBoth PLCγ1 and Shp2 SH2 domains bind a phosphorylated Tyr568 RCM peptide in vitro. Subsequent analysis of PLCγ1 has not identified a netrin-dependent interaction with intact RCM, raising doubt as to whether this interaction is relevant to RCM signaling. In contrast, the results of in vitro peptide pull downs, receptor immunoprecipitations, and point mutation experiments all indicate that Shp2 is recruited to the phosphorylated RCM receptor after netrin stimulation, in a fashion that requires binding of the Shp2 SH2 domains to the Tyr568 phosphorylated motif. Since a Y568F substitution increased RCM tyrosine phosphorylation under some circumstances, it is possible that RCM is itself a direct substrate for Shp2 and that one function of Shp2-binding to RCM is to modulate the phosphorylation of other tyrosine sites on RCM. It is also possible that Shp2 may directly contribute to signaling downstream of RCM. For example, Shp2 can regulate the activity of the RhoA GTPase (50Schoenwaelder S.M. Petch L.A. Williamson D. Shen R. Feng G. Burridge K. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 1523-1526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) and Shp2 is known to be important for cell migration and the normal organization of focal adhesions during mammalian embryogenesis and in cultured murine cells (51Saxton T.M. Pawson T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3790-3795Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 52Yu D.H. Qu C.K. Henegariu O. Lu X. Feng G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21125-21131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). Consistent with these results, Rho family GTPases can be activated by chemorepellants or chemoattractants leading to either localized actin-based protrusion or retraction of the growth cone in different cell types (53Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5185) Google Scholar). Increasing Shp2 activity can potentially reduce RhoA activity and focal adhesions and thereby increase cell motility through an effect on cell adhesion. By modulating RhoA activity, Shp2 could also have a localized effect on actin dynamics within the growth cone and thus contribute to polarized movements in response to netrin. The recuitment of Shp2 to RCM may therefore have a direct influence on the control of cell movement in response to netrin stimulation.The functional relevance of Tyr568 phosphorylation in vivo is presently being tested in C. elegans. For this purpose, the equivalent of the RCM Y568F mutation was introduced intoC. elegans UNC-5 (Y538F). UNC-5 Y538F has a slightly reduced ability to rescue the uncoordination phenotype of unc-5 null animals relative to rescue experiments using wild type UNC-5; however, visual examination of dorsal/ventral axons revealed no significant difference in axonal pathfinding between the animals containing UNC-5 Y538F and those containing wild type UNC-5. This result indicates that the loss of one signaling pathway may not result in a strong defectin vivo. This is not uncommon in receptor signal transduction. For example, mice lacking either the β-platelet-derived growth factor receptor or platelet-derived growth factor-B exhibit pericyte defects, which result in perinatal lethality (54Leveen P. Pekny M. Gebre-Medhin S. Swolin B. Larsson E. Betsholtz C. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1875-1887Crossref PubMed Scopus (861) Google Scholar, 55Lindahl P. Johansson B.R. Leveen P. Betsholtz C. Science. 1997; 277: 242-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (1716) Google Scholar, 56Lindahl P. Karlsson L. Hellstrom M. Gebre-Medhin S. Willetts K. Heath J.K. Betsholtz C.

However, mice homozygous for β-platelet-derived growth factor receptor mutants that no longer activate phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase or PLCγ or both, were phenotypically normal (58Tallquist M.D. Klinghoffer R.A. Heuchel R. Mueting-Nelsen P.F. Corrin P.D. Heldin C.H. Johnson R.J. Soriano P. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 3179-3190Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), and defects were only identified upon analysis of mutant cells in culture or experimental manipulation of mutant animals. These results support the idea that receptor signals may be redundant or complementary in vivo, such that the loss of multiple signaling pathways may be required for observable defects. We are in the process of introducing multiple tyrosine to phenylalanine mutations into UNC-5 to test the ability of UNC-5 lacking multiple phosphorylation sites to rescue theunc-5 null phenotype. Preliminary results show that, relative to the single-site mutants, the multiple-site mutants have a severely reduced ability to rescue the uncoordination of anunc-5 null mutant.In summary, our results show that the UNC-5 netrin receptor and its mammalian homologue RCM are tyrosine phosphorylated in vivoin a fashion that is partially dependent on netrin stimulation. Phosphorylation of a specific tyrosine motif in RCM creates a binding site for the SH2 domains of the Shp2 tyrosine phosphatase. These data indicate that tyrosine phosphorylation is involved in UNC-5 signaling and the control of cell movement. Neuronal growth cones in the developing nervous system are guided to their targets by attractive and repulsive guidance cues. Several proteins have been identified that play critical roles in guiding axons along their stereotypical pathways, including members of the ephrin, Netrin, Semaphorin, and Slit protein families. Several classes of transmembrane receptors for these various guidance cues have been identified and characterized (see Refs. 1Tessier-Lavigne M. Goodman C.S. Science. 1996; 274: 1123-1133Crossref PubMed Scopus (2674) Google Scholar and 2Mueller B.K. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1999; 22: 351-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar for reviews). In the case of the netrins, there are two known classes of receptors, the deleted in colorectal cancer (DCC)1 and UNC-5 families. The DCC family receptors (UNC-40, Frazzled, or DCC inCaenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila, and mammals, respectively) are required for the attraction of growth cones by netrins in vitro. Loss of function mutations in the corresponding genes result in misrouting of axons that are normally attracted to a netrin source in vivo (3Chan S.S. Zheng H. Su M.W. Wilk R. Killeen M.T.

The UNC-5 family receptors, regarded as co-receptors of DCC, are required for the repulsive effect of the netrins. In C. elegans, the loss of UNC-5 function in neurons that normally project away from an UNC-6/netrin source results in misrouting similar to that observed inunc-6 mutants. Ectopic expression of UNC-5 in neurons that normally fail to respond to UNC-6 netrin causes their axons to be directed away from the source in an UNC-40 dependent manner (7Leung-Hagesteijn C.

It has been shown to mediate the activation of complement upon binding to specific microbial carbohydrate motifs, to directly opsonize organisms, and to enhance the phagocytosis of targets suboptimally opsonized with IgG or complement components C3b or C4b. This enhancement of phagocytic activity induced by MBL and other molecules that contain a collagen-like region contiguous with a pattern recognition domain is mediated by a 126,000 M r surface glycoprotein, designated C1qRP.

Although effective individually, the complement system and phagocytic cells also interact with each other synergistically to facilitate the innate (first-line) immune defense system. Mannan-binding lectin (MBL),1 a serum protein of hepatic origin belonging to a family of Ca2+-dependent collagenous lectins, is an important component of the innate immune system (1Holmskov U. Malhotra R. Sim R.B. Jensenius J.C. Immunol. Today. 1994; 15: 67-74Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar, 2Kawasaki N. Kawasaki T. Yamashina I. J. Biochem. 1983; 94: 937-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). MBL is a multichain molecule of up to six subunits; each subunit consists of three identical 32-kDa polypeptide chains that contain a cysteine rich NH2-terminal domain, which stabilizes the collagen α-helix of the second domain and a third COOH-terminal carbohydrate-binding domain (3Drickamer K. Dordal M.S. Reynolds L. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 6878-6887Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The collagen-like domain consists of 18–20 repeats of the triplet sequence GXY (whereY is often Pro or Hyp) (3Drickamer K. Dordal M.S. Reynolds L. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 6878-6887Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Human MBL is present in blood as a mixture of oligomers of its subunit with trimers/tetramers and pentamers/hexamers, constituting ∼80 and 15% of the pool, respectively. MBL activates the complement system via two serum proteases, MASP-1 and MASP-2 (4Takada F. Takayama Y. Hatsuse H. Kawakami M. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

This lectin pathway of complement activation leads to complement-dependent lysis by a process that requires C4, C2, C3, and the macromolecular attack complex (7Ji Y.H. Matsushita M. Okada H.

Acton S. Ashkenas J. Pearson A. Penman M. Resnick D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4569-4572Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).

Thus, it has been hypothesized that common structural features of the collagen-like domains may provide a basis for this biological function of MBL, C1q, and SP-A. In addition, it was known that C1q in complex with C1r and C1s had no ability to enhance phagocytosis, suggesting that the regions above or below the kink region (where C1r and C1s associate with C1q) would be likely candidates for the receptor interaction domain.This study was undertaken to determine the exact interaction site in the collagen-like domain of these defense collagens that mediates the enhancement of phagocytosis. A region containing a common amino acid sequence was noted when sequences of MBL and C1q near the kink region were examined. We used the baculovirus expression system for generating recombinant MBL and various mutants of MBL. The effect of the purified rMBL and mutant MBL on the FcR and CR1-mediated phagocytosis by monocytes was then assessed. Two of the mutants constructed with a common deletion of two GXY triplets below the kink did not enhance phagocytosis, whereas wild type rMBL and other mutants retained activity. These data provide evidence that this sequence is necessary for the C1qRp-mediated enhancement of phagocytosis.DISCUSSIONThe generation of rMBL and its mutants provided the reagents for defining the critical interaction site necessary for C1qRP-mediated enhancement of phagocytosis. In this study we have shown that rMBL generated in the baculovirus expression system is functionally active in enhancing FcR- and CR1-mediated phagocytosis. Using the recombinant mutant proteins, we have demonstrated that the removal of the sequence GEKGEP (amino acids 37–42) from the collagen-like domain of MBL abolishes the ability of MBL to enhance phagocytosis. These data suggest that these two GXYtriplets are critical for the interaction of MBL with cells leading to the enhancement of phagocytosis.MBL, SP-A, and C1q, all of which have been shown to increase the phagocytic activity of cells of myeloid lineage via C1qRP, have similar macromolecular structures with a globular COOH-terminal “recognition” domain that mediates binding to specific sugar or lipid moieties or, in the case of C1q, the Fc domain of specific immunoglobulin molecules and select pathogens (30Cooper N.R. Advances in Immunology. 1985; 37: 151-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). The contiguous collagen-like domain has a characteristic interruption in the GXY repeat pattern and hydroxylated amino acids. Previously reported studies have shown that the C1q cell interaction site that mediates enhanced phagocytic capacity is located in the collagen-like portion of the C1q molecule (18Bobak D.A. Gaither T.G. Frank M.M. Tenner A.J. J. Immunol. 1987; 138: 1150-1156PubMed Google Scholar, 31Tenner A.J. Cooper N.R. J. Immunol. 1980; 125: 1658-1664PubMed Google Scholar). However, because intact C1q has not been successfully recombinantly expressed in any system, further localization of the site in the collagen-like domain of defense collagens that enhances phagocytosis with C1q was not possible. Because functional MBL has been generated in recombinant expression systems, we chose to use MBL as the model C1qRP ligand and to construct various mutants using the baculovirus expression system.Phagocytosis assays performed using these mutants revealed that wild type MBL, mutant A, and mutant Del enhanced both FcR- and CR1-mediated phagocytosis in a manner similar to C1q, whereas the −5 mutant, which had five GXY triplets deleted below the “kink,” did not. Construction of two mutants, one with a deletion of three of those five GXY triplets (mutant −3) and the second with the two other triplets deleted (mutant −2), allowed the localization of the critical interaction region in that the −3 mutant retained the wild type MBL ability to enhance phagocytosis, whereas the −2 mutant showed no ability to enhance phagocytosis. In contrast, a mutant with two different GXY triplets deleted above the kink (Del) showed no loss of activity. In addition, deletion of the coding sequence for the two amino acids responsible for the kink in the collagen-like structure of MBL adjacent to the implicated sequence (GEKGEP) also showed no loss of activity. These data together suggest that: 1) the deletion of any two GXY triplets does not interrupt the functional activity (mutant Del); 2) deletion of triplets below the kink does not necessarily nonspecifically destabilize the collagen-like structure necessary for functional cell interaction (mutant −3); and 3) changes at or near the kink region are not particularly more likely to induce loss of function (mutant A). Thus, the sequence GEKGEP in the MBL molecule appears to be critical for the enhancement of phagocytosis.SDS-PAGE analysis of rMBL and its various mutants showed that all of the mutants have a similar macromolecular structure, which was confirmed by similar sucrose density gradient centrifugation profiles. In addition, CD analysis demonstrated that mutants have similar secondary structure, and thus loss of phagocytic activity of −2 and −5 mutants is not due to the loss of secondary structure of the molecule. Furthermore, no statistical difference among the coating efficiencies of native and mutant MBL proteins was detected, suggesting that the failure of mutants −2 and −5 to enhance phagocytosis is not due to a decreased density of protein on the plates.As reported previously, a monoclonal anti-C1qRP inhibited the stimulation of phagocytic activity by the active MBL mutants (Fig.7), indicating that the assessed activity is mediated through C1qRP. The antibody had no effect on the base-line phagocytosis when cells were assayed in the presence of human albumin or when mutants −2 and −5 were the proteins coated on the well. Examination of the amino acid sequence of other defense collagens that have been shown previously to enhance phagocytosis via C1qRP revealed that human SP-A and rat and mouse MBL had the identical sequence, GEKGEP (Fig. 8), although the sequence in SP-A was found at a considerable distance above the kink rather than below it. In contrast, the A chain of human and mouse C1q contains a sequence that is similar but not identical to the MBL sequence in that the lysine (K) in the GEKGEP is substituted with a glutamine or an arginine residue, respectively. That is, the human C1q sequence is GEQGEP, and the mouse C1q A chain sequence is GERGEP. We postulate that these relatively conservative amino acid substitutions would have hydrogen-bonding capabilities similar to the lysine in the MBL and SP-A molecules and would fulfill a role in the C1qRP-mediated enhancement of phagocytosis similar to that of the GEKGEP sequence in MBL. In addition, because C1q is a hexamer of trimers with three distinct polypeptide chains, A, B, and C, in contrast to the homotrimers of MBL and SP-A, it appears that only one such motif per trimer is required for induction of function.Interestingly, five of the six MBL molecules studied, including the inactive −2 and −5 mutants, have the sequence GQKGDP within their collagen-like domains. Thus, four of the amino acids (G X KG X P) in this motif are not sufficient for activity, suggesting that the two negatively charged amino acids (GEKGEP) are critical for the functional interaction. In addition, the presence of this motif with the conservative substitutions of Gln and Asp for the glutamic acid residues suggests that the two acidic residues in the middle of the triplets in this identified active motif are critical for induction of this function, although location within the protein structure has not be eliminated as a contributing factor. (It should also be noted that there is no evidence that this similar 6-amino acid sequence contributes to activity, because mutant Del lacks the GQK and yet retains full activity.) As shown in Fig. 8, the murine and human C1q molecules have the conservative substitutions Gln and Arg for the Lys in position 3 of the motif, and thus the lysine residue has some flexibility. Taken together, the data implicate the negatively charged residues (Glu) at positions 2 and 5 of the identified motif as critical in some way for the functional interaction of MBL with the cell. Although it is established that these six amino acids are required for activity, it remains to be established whether only one or both glutamic acid residues are required, whether the requirement is only for an acidic amino acid in both positions, and whether any of the remaining amino acids contribute to the enhancement of phagocytosis. A model of this region of MBL based on the known crystal structure of a synthetic collagen peptide (32Bella J. Eaton M. Brodsky B. Berman H.M. Science. 1994; 266: 75-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (874) Google Scholar) presented in Fig.9 demonstrates a possible orientation of the residues in this motif.Figure 9Molecular model of residues 37–42 of MBL.

This is consistent with other observations supporting the hypothesis that the cell surface structures involved in the interaction of C1q that leads to enhancement of phagocytic activity is somehow critically different from that which leads to the induction of neutrophil NADPH oxidase activity and thus superoxide generation (35Tenner A.J. Immunobiology. 1998; 199: 250-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 36Tenner A.J. Behring Inst. Mitt. 1989; 84: 220-235Google Scholar).C1qRP was first detected on professional phagocytic cells such as peripheral blood monocytes, neutrophils, umbilical cord endothelial cells, microglia, and myeloid cell lines (35Tenner A.J.

However, recent reports investigating the tissue expression of this receptor suggest that other cell types such as endothelial cells (39Fonseca, M. I., Carpenter, P.

As the role of C1qRP in these other cell types is defined, it will be important to determine whether this consensus motif for enhancement of phagocytosis is also required for the functional responses of these distinct cell types.In summary, our results demonstrate that a conserved amino acid motif of the collagen-like domains of the defense collagens, GE(K/Q/R)GEP, is necessary for C1qRP-induced enhancement of FcR- and CR1-mediated phagocytosis in human monocytes. Future studies involving both site-specific mutagenesis and the synthesis of specific peptides that form a collagen-like triple helix would allow further resolution of the molecular interaction mechanism, as well as the determination of whether this peptide motif is sufficient to induce enhancement of phagocytosis. The ability to modulate phagocytosis, a powerful effector mechanism of the innate immune system, could be particularly beneficial in the early stage of infection. This capacity might limit disease from infection, while allowing the adaptive response to be induced for future rapid and specific protective immunity. Vertebrates have developed very complicated defense mechanisms, including innate and adaptive immune systems to prevent infection by pathogenic microorganisms. Although effective individually, the complement system and phagocytic cells also interact with each other synergistically to facilitate the innate (first-line) immune defense system. Mannan-binding lectin (MBL),1 a serum protein of hepatic origin belonging to a family of Ca2+-dependent collagenous lectins, is an important component of the innate immune system (1Holmskov U. Malhotra R. Sim R.B. Jensenius J.C. Immunol. Today. 1994; 15: 67-74Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar, 2Kawasaki N. Kawasaki T. Yamashina I. J. Biochem. 1983; 94: 937-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). MBL is a multichain molecule of up to six subunits; each subunit consists of three identical 32-kDa polypeptide chains that contain a cysteine rich NH2-terminal domain, which stabilizes the collagen α-helix of the second domain and a third COOH-terminal carbohydrate-binding domain (3Drickamer K. Dordal M.S. Reynolds L. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 6878-6887Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The collagen-like domain consists of 18–20 repeats of the triplet sequence GXY (whereY is often Pro or Hyp) (3Drickamer K. Dordal M.S. Reynolds L. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 6878-6887Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Human MBL is present in blood as a mixture of oligomers of its subunit with trimers/tetramers and pentamers/hexamers, constituting ∼80 and 15% of the pool, respectively. MBL activates the complement system via two serum proteases, MASP-1 and MASP-2 (4Takada F. Takayama Y. Hatsuse H. Kawakami M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 196: 1003-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 5Sato T. Endo Y. Matsushita M. Fujita T. Int. Immunol. 1994; 6: 665-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 6Thiel S.

Nature. 1997; 386: 506-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar). This lectin pathway of complement activation leads to complement-dependent lysis by a process that requires C4, C2, C3, and the macromolecular attack complex (7Ji Y.H. Matsushita M. Okada H.

In addition to providing protection to the host through triggering complement activation, MBL is a member of a family of proteins called the defense collagens (9Krieger M. Acton S. Ashkenas J. Pearson A. Penman M. Resnick D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4569-4572Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This group of proteins contains a characteristic NH2-terminal collagen-like domain as well as a globular carboxyl-terminal domain that includes recognition sites for what Medzhitov and Janeway (10Medzhitov R.

Immunity. 1995; 3: 485-493Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar); this enhancement is mediated via a 126,000 M r surface glycoprotein designated C1qRP (16Tenner A.J. Robinson S.L.

This suggests that Gsa9 binds to the peroxisomes independent of the vacuole.

Chem. 1988; 263: 2506-2512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We will use the term pexophagy (micro and macro pathways) in reference to the autophagy of peroxisomes because of its selectivity for degrading these organelles (3Kim J. Klionsky D.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 303-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, 22Klionsky D.J. J. Membr. Biol. 1997; 157: 105-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 23Klionsky D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10807-10810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In addition to pexophagy, P. pastoris also displays nonselective autophagy upon nutrient starvation whereby portions of the cytosol are sequestered into autophagosomes (macroautophagy) or directly into the vacuole (microautophagy). We have identified a number of GSA1 genes that are necessary for glucose-induced selectiveautophagy of peroxisomes (micropexophagy) in P. pastoris. The S. cerevisiae homologues of many of these genes have been shown to be required for both selective and nonselective autophagy (Table I). The studies from a number of laboratories have resulted in many S. cerevisiae genes having multiple names. For our purposes, we will conform to the names used by the Saccharomyces Genome Database. We have shown that two genes, GSA1 and GSA9, are required for early events of glucose-induced pexophagy but not starvation-induced nonselective autophagy. GSA1 encodes phosphofructokinase 1, but we found that its enzymatic activity is not required for micropexophagy. Gsa9 is a protein that during glucose-induced pexophagy relocates from a structure at the vacuole surface, which we have referred to as the Gsa9 compartment, to the vacuolar arms that sequester the peroxisomes. Our data suggest that peroxisome recognition by the vacuole is likely mediated by Gsa9 and that this protein may act to tether the vacuole to the peroxisomes (24Kim J. Kamada Y. Strømhaug P.E.

In addition, we have shown that Cvt9, the S. cerevisiae homologue of Gsa9, is necessary for selective autophagy of aminopeptidase I and peroxisomes but not starvation-induced autophagy. Cvt9 is a member of a protein complex that includes proteins required for selective and nonselective autophagy, Apg1, Apg13, and Apg17, and a vacuolar membrane protein required for vacuole inheritance and selective autophagy, Vac8 (25Scott S.V.

We have found that Gsa10, a protein homologous to the serine/threonine protein kinase Apg1, is required for pexophagy and autophagy in P. pastoris. 2P. E. Strømhaug and W. A. Dunn, Jr., unpublished results. Gsa19, also known as PpVps15, is a serine/threonine protein kinase that is required for an early event of pexophagy in P. pastoris (27Stasyk O.V. van der Klei I.J.

Open table in a new tab A key enzyme in both selective and nonselective autophagy in P. pastoris and S. cerevisiae is Gsa7 and Apg7, respectively (31Tanida I. Mizushima N. Kiyooka M. Ohsumi M.

In S. cerevisiae Apg7 together with Apg10 catalyze an amide linkage between the carboxyl group of the C-terminal glycine of Apg12 to an ε-amino group of a lysine moiety in Apg5 (34Mizushima N.

Ohsumi Y. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5234-5241Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). This conjugate then promotes the lipidation of Aut7, a reaction that is catalyzed by Apg7 and Aut1 (36Ichimura Y. Kirisako T. Takao T. Satomi Y. Shimonishi Y. Ishihara N. Mizushima N. Tanida I. Kominami E. Ohsumi M. Noda T. Ohsumi Y.

Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 263-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar). It is believed that the conjugation of Apg12 to Apg5 is essential for the formation of the autophagosome in S. cerevisiae. However, it has been shown that Aut7 is not required for formation, but for expansion of the autophagosome thereby increasing the amount of sequestered cellular components (38Abeliovich H. Dunn W.A. Kim J. Klionsky D.J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1025-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Our studies in P. pastoris suggest that Gsa7 acts at a late step in the sequestration of peroxisomes, possibly by bringing the opposing vacuolar membranes together for homotypic fusion to take place (32Yuan W. Strømhaug P.E. Dunn Jr., W.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1353-1366Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Studies have shown that microautophagy and macroautophagy are morphologically distinct pathways for the selective and nonselective degradation of cellular proteins. However, data from both S. cerevisiae and P. pastoris models suggest that the sequestration events clearly require many of the same proteins. For example, many of the CVT genes required for selective macroautophagy of aminopeptidase I are analogous to APG and AUT genes required for nonselective macroautophagy (Table I). In addition, data from Mayer's laboratory (39Muller O. Sattler T. Flotenmeyer M. Schwarz H. Plattner H. Mayer A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 519-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 40Sattler T. Mayer A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 529-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) reveal that nonselective microautophagy in S. cerevisiae is reduced without Apg1, Apg7, Aut1, or Aut7. We have reported that Gsa7 is required for both micropexophagy and macroautophagy in P. pastoris (32Yuan W. Strømhaug P.E. Dunn Jr., W.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1353-1366Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). In addition, we have observed that many of our GSA genes required for micropexophagy (selective microautophagy) are also necessary for macroautophagy.2 Finally, these degradative pathways converge at the vacuole and require vacuolar hydrolytic enzymes such as Pep4, Prb1, and Cvt17 (6Takeshige K. Baba M. Tsuboi S. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 301-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (959) Google Scholar, 9Tuttle D.L. Dunn Jr., W.A. J.

Chem. 2001; 276: 2083-2087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The data indicate that there exist many molecular events common to micro- and macroautophagy. In the present work, we describe a novel protein required for micropexophagy, macropexophagy, and starvation-induced autophagy in P. pastoris. Gsa11 is a 208-kDa protein with homologues in many eukaryotes. The data suggest that Gsa11 is not required for Gsa9 to interact with the peroxisomes but for later event in the sequestration process. However, unlike Gsa9 we have no evidence to suggest that Gsa11 acts at the site of sequestration. Indeed, when cells adapt from methanol to glucose, Gsa11 relocates from the cytosol to structures that are juxtaposed to the vacuole surface opposite to the site of sequestration. These structures may be analogous to the Apg9 compartment that we have described in S. cerevisiae and that contains Apg2, the S. cerevisiae homologue of Gsa11 (42Wang C.W. Kim J. Huang W.P. Abeliovich H. Strømhaug P.E. Dunn Jr., W.A. Klionsky D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30442-30451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The localization of Gsa11 to this compartment requires Gsa10, Gsa12, PpVps15, and Gsa14, the P. pastoris homologue of Apg9 but not Gsa9 or Gsa7. We propose that the association of Gsa11 with this compartment is essential for vacuole sequestration of peroxisomes. The yeast strains used in this study are listed in Table II and were routinely cultured at 30 °C in YPD (1% Bacto yeast extract, 2% Bacto peptone, and 2% dextrose). P. pastoris was grown in YNM (0.67% yeast nitrogen base, 0.4 mg/liter biotin, and 0.5% methanol) to induce peroxisome biogenesis. The degradation of peroxisomes was induced when cells grown in YNM were transferred to YND (0.67% yeast nitrogen base, 0.4 mg/liter biotin, and 2% glucose). Nitrogen starvation medium contained 0.17% yeast nitrogen base (without amino acids and NH4SO4) and 2% glucose. All media contained 2% agar when made as plates. Histidine or arginine or both were added at 0.4 mg/liter when needed. Zeocin was added at 25 μg/ml when culturing Escherichia coli (DH5α) and 100 μg/ml when culturing P. pastoris.Table IIYeast strains used in this studyStrainGenotypeSourceGS115his471SMD1163his4 pep4 prb19PPF1his4 arg446WDKO1PPF1 gsa1Δ∷ARG446DMM1GS115∷pDM1 (PAOX1BFP-SKL, Zeocin)24STW1PPF1 his4∷pTW51(PAOX1GFP-SKL, HIS4)16WDY7his4 gsa732WDKO7PPF1 gsa7Δ∷ARG432Pp vps15Dhis4 arg4 vps15∷ARG427R2GS115 gsa12∷ZeocinThis studyR8/R5GS115 gsa9–2∷Zeocin24R12GS115 gsa10∷ZeocinThis studyR11/R15GS115 gsa11–1∷ZeocinThis studyR22GS115 gsa11–2∷ZeocinThis studyWDKO11GS115 gsa11Δ∷ZeocinThis studyR19GS115 gsa14∷ZeocinThis studyWDY22STW1∷pR11 (gsa11–1∷Zeocin)This studyWDY36R22 his4∷pPS67 (PGAP GFP/HA-GSA11 (NT), HIS4)This studyWDY37R22 his4∷pPS69 (PGAPGFP/HA-GSA11, HIS4)This studyWDY38R22 his4∷pWD12 (PGAP GFP/HA-GSA11 (CT), HIS4)This studyWDY45DMM1 his4∷pPS69 (PGAPGFP/HA-GSA11, HIS4)This studyWDY46R2 his4∷pPS69 (PGAP GFP/HA-GSA11, HIS4)This studyWDY47R8 his4∷pPS69 (PGAP GFP/HA-GSA11, HIS4)This studyWDY48R19 his4∷pPS69 (PGAP GFP/HA-GSA11, HIS4)This studyWDY49R12 his4∷pPS69 (PGAP GFP/HA-GSA11, HIS4)This studyWDY50WDY7 his4∷pPS69 (PGAP GFP/HA-GSA11, HIS4)This studyWDY51Pp vps15D his4∷pPS69 (PGAP GFP/HA-GSA11, HIS4)This studyANB6WDY7 his4∷pPS64 (PGAP GFP/HA-GSA9, HIS4)This studyANB7R2 his4∷pPS64 (PGAP GFP/HA-GSA9, HIS4)Guan et al. 3ANB9R11 his4∷pPS64 (PGAP GFP/HA-GSA9, HIS4)This studyANB12WDK09 his4∷pPS64 (PGAPGFP/HA-GSA9, HIS4)Guan et al. 3 Open table in a new tab Cells grown overnight in YPD to a density of A600 = 1.0 were harvested and treated with 10 mm dithiothreitol in YPD containing 25 mm HEPES, pH 8, for 15 min at 30 °C. The cells were washed twice in ice-cold water and once in 1 m sorbitol and then resuspended into 1 m sorbitol. Cells (40 μl) were mixed with 0.2–1 μg of DNA and transferred to a 0.2-cm gap cuvette (Bio-Rad), and the DNA was introduced by electroporation at 1.5 kV, 25 microfarads, 400 ohms (Gene Pulser, Bio-Rad Corp.). The cells were transferred to plates containing 0.67% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, 2% glucose, 1 m sorbitol, 0.4 mg/liter biotin, and 2% agar and incubated at 30 °C for 3–5 days before colonies appeared. The theory behind our mutagenesis approach is to randomly insert a vector with a selectable marker into the genome of P. pastoris and then screen for gsa mutants caused by disruption of gene expression. Vector integration is assisted by the presence of BamHI or DpnII, which will randomly cleave the genomic DNA in vivo leaving 4-base overhangs that are compatible to the overhangs of a BamHI-linearized vector. pREMI (provided by Dr. Ben Glick, University of Chicago) is a plasmid, which contains a Zeocin resistance gene behind TEF and EM7 promoters allowing for selection in both yeast and E. coli. BamHI-linearized pREMI and 1 unit of BamHI or 0.5 units of DpnII were incorporated into GS115 cells by electroporation (see above). Zeocin-resistant transformants were selected for growth on YPD plates containing 1 m sorbitol and 100 μg/ml Zeocin and then screened by direct colony assays for defects in glucose-induced peroxisome degradation (see below). Purple colonies were picked, and the mutant phenotype was verified by liquid medium assay (see below). The site of insertion of the pREMI and identification of the disrupted gene were done as follows. Genomic DNA was isolated by ethanol precipitation from extracts that had been generated by vortexing cells with glass beads and equal volumes of 2% Triton X-100, 1% SDS, 1 mm EDTA, and 100 mmNaCl in 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, and phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1). The genomic DNA was digested with either EcoRI or HindIII and religated, and the pREMI vector with flanking genomic DNA was amplified in E. coli. Plasmids were isolated and sequenced using primers that flanked the BamHI site in pREMI. By sequencing the genomic DNA fragments that were isolated along with the pREMI vectors from the R11, R15, and R22 mutants, we were able to completely assemble the GSA11 gene (NCBI accession number AF309871) and to show that pREMI disruption occurred between valine 1197 and proline 1198 in the R11 and R15 mutants and aspartic acid 757 and isoleucine 758 in the R22 mutant. By using this approach, we have also isolated R2, R8, R10, and R19 mutants. The R2 (his4 gsa12::Zeocin) mutant will be described elsewhere. 3Guan, J., Strømhaug, P. E., George, M. D., Habibzadegah-Tari, P., Bevan, A., Dunn, W. A., Jr., and Klionsky, D. J. (2001) Mol. Biol. Cell, in press. The R8 (his4 gsa9-2::Zeocin) mutant has been characterized previously, and the GSA9 gene has been shown to encode a protein homologous to S. cerevisiae Cvt9 (24Kim J. Kamada Y. Strømhaug P.E. Guan J.

R10 and R19 mutants had the pREMI inserted into the GSA10and GSA14 genes, respectively. GSA10 encoded a protein with sequence homology to S. cerevisiae Apg1 (43Straub M. Bredschneider M. Thumm M. J.

Forward (5′ TCCACTTCGAGCCTGCACTATCAACGATCAGGGCAAGCGATACAAGTATTCAATACACTCCTCTTCAGAGTACAGAAGA 3′) and reverse (5′ GCTCCCAACAAAAAAGTCTTGAAAGCCTTTAACATGAAAGTTACAATTAATAGACTGAAAGGCGGACAGGTATCCGGTAA 3′) primers were used to PCR-amplify the Zeocin resistance gene with the TEF promoter from pPICz (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) flanked by 55 base pairs of sequence analogous to −84 through −29 base pairs and 2849 through 2903 base pairs of GSA11. The PCR product was gel-purified and used to transform GS115 cells. The transformants were selected on YPD plates containing 1 m sorbitol and 100 μg/ml zeocin and replica-plated to YNM plates. Possible null mutants were identified by direct colony assay (see below). The gsa11Δ mutant was then verified by liquid assay (see below) and by PCR using primers flanking GSA11 and within the Zeocin resistance gene. The direct colony assay to detect peroxisomal AOX was performed as described previously with some modifications (9Tuttle D.L. Dunn Jr., W.A. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 25-35Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,46Yuan W. Tuttle D.L. Shi Y.J. Ralph G.S. Dunn Jr., W.A. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1935-1945Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, colonies were replica-plated from Zeocin selection plates onto YNM plates and allowed to grow for 3–4 days. At this time, replicas on nitrocellulose were placed onto YND plates for 12 h. The colonies on the nitrocellulose were frozen in liquid nitrogen for 20 s to lyse the cells. AOX activity was then visualized by placing the nitrocellulose on Whatman paper soaked with 33 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, containing 0.13% methanol, 3.4 units/ml horseradish peroxidase, and 0.53 mg/ml 2,2′-azinobis(3-ethylbenzthazoline-6-sulfonic acid) at room temperature for 60–90 min. Cells were grown in 20 ml of YNM with methanol as the sole carbon and energy source. At 40 h, 0.4 g of glucose or 100 μl of ethanol was added. Aliquots (2 ml) of cells (8.0 A600) at 0 and 6 h of glucose or ethanol adaptation were pelleted and resuspended in 1 ml of 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, containing 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin. The cells were then lysed by vortexing in the presence of 500 μl of glass beads (425–600 μm). The glass beads and cellular debris were removed by centrifugation, and AOX was measured by adding 50 μl of this extract to 3 ml of reaction mix containing 3.4 units/ml horseradish peroxidase and 0.53 mg/ml 2,2′-azinobis(3-ethylbenzthazoline-6-sulfonic acid) in 33 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5 (8Tuttle D.L.

The reaction was started by adding 10 μl of methanol and continued at room temperature for 30–60 min. Subsequently, the assay was stopped by adding 200 μl of 4 n HCl and the absorbance read at 410 nm. The degradation of cellular proteins during nitrogen starvation was performed as described previously (9Tuttle D.L. Dunn Jr., W.A. J.

Endogenous proteins were radiolabeled with 1 μCi/ml [14C]valine for 16 h in 0.67% yeast nitrogen base, 2% glucose, 0.4 mg/liter biotin, and 4 mg % histidine (if needed). The cells were then washed and switched to nitrogen starvation medium containing 0.17% yeast nitrogen base (without amino acids and NH4SO4) and 2% glucose and supplemented with 10 mm valine.

Apparently, convergent evolution by recruitment of several unique enzymes has resulted in the unique Pyrococcus glycolysis. glucokinase phosphofructokinase phosphoglucose isomerase polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid The hyperthermophilic archaeon Pyrococcus furiosus is capable of metabolizing sugars via a modified Embden-Meyerhof pathway (1Kengen S.W.M. de Bok F.A.M.

A first variation of the pyrococcal glycolysis concerns the unique ADP-dependent sugar kinases, i.e.ADP-dependent glucokinase (ADP-GLK)1 and ADP-dependent phosphofructokinase (ADP-PFK) have been characterized biochemically, and the paralogous genes were identified on the P. furiosus genome (2Kengen S.W.M.

The recently determined crystal structure of the ADP-GLK from the related archaeonThermococcus litoralis revealed that the ADP-dependent sugar kinase family (ADP-GLK and most likely ADP-PFK) belong to the ribokinase family (6Ito S. Fushinobu S. Yoshioka I. Koga S. Matsuzawa H. Wakagi T. Structure. 2001; 9: 205-214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), whereas their bacterial and eukaryal counterparts belong to the hexokinase and PFK family, respectively (7Siebers B.

A second variation concerns the glycolytic conversion of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate to 3-phosphoglycerate in P. furiosus that was found to be catalyzed by the unique glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate ferredoxin oxidoreductase enzyme (4Mukund S.

This ferredoxin-dependent, single-step conversion of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate was shown to represent a novel site of glycolytic regulation in P. furiosus (5Van der Oost J. Schut G. Kengen S.W.M.

With the increasing number of available sequence data from different species, including bacteria, eucarya, and archaea, and functional characterization of the gene products, most of the genes encoding the other P. furiosus glycolytic enzymes (fructose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase, triose-phosphate isomerase, phosphoglycerate mutase, enolase, and pyruvate kinase) encoding genes could readily be identified in its genome (9Dandekar T. Schutser S. Snel B. Huynen M. Bork P. Biochem. J. 1999; 343: 115-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Attempts to identify the gene encoding phosphoglucose isomerase (PGI) by a bioinformatics approach have hitherto been unsuccessful. Although significant PGI activity has previously been detected (0.2 units/mg) in a P. furiosus cell-free extract (1Kengen S.W.M. de Bok F.A.M. Van Loo N.D. Dijkema C. Stams A.J.M. de Vos W.M. J.

This suggested that P. furiosus might possess a distinct type of PGI. To complete the P. furiosusglycolytic pathway and to obtain insight in the anticipated novel type of PGI, we here report on the purification of the PGI enzyme fromP. furiosus, its characterization, and the isolation of the corresponding pgiA gene. This is the first molecular and biochemical characterization of an archaeal PGI, that indeed represents a novel type of this enzyme. All chemicals and enzymes were purchased from Sigma, Merck, or Roche Molecular Diagnostics in analytical grade.Aspergillus nidulans mannitol-1-phosphate dehydrogenase was purified from an overproducing A. nidulans strain as described previously (12Ruijter G.J.G. Visser J. Biochimie. 1999; 81: 267-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). P. furiosus was cultivated in artificial seawater medium as described before (3Tuininga J.E. Verhees C.H.

Chem. 1999; 274: 21023-21028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar).Escherichia coli XL1 Blue was used as a host for the construction of pET24d derivatives. E. coli BL21(DE3) was used as an expression host. Both strains were grown in Luria Bertani medium with kanamycin (50 µg/ml) in a rotary shaker at 37 °C. P. furiosus cells from a 200-liter culture were harvested by continuous centrifugation (Sharples, Rueil, France) and stored at −20 °C until use. Cell-free extract was prepared by suspending a cell paste in 2 volumes (w/v) of 50 mm Tris/HCl buffer, pH 7.5, and treatment in a French press at 100 megapascals. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation for 1 h at 100,000 ×g at 10 °C. To prevent microbial contamination, all buffers contained 0.02% sodium azide. Cell-free extract (27 ml) was filtered (0.45 µm), brought to 1.7 m ammonium sulfate saturation and loaded onto a Phenyl-Sepharose fast flow column (69 ml, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), equilibrated in 50 mm Tris/HCl buffer, pH 7.8, containing 1.7 m ammonium sulfate. During a 350-ml linear gradient (1.7–0.0 m ammonium sulfate) PGI activity eluted at 1.0 m ammonium sulfate. Active fractions were pooled and desalted by filtration (Macrosep, 10-kDa cutoff), using a 50 mm Tris/HCl buffer, pH 8.5. The desalted PGI pool was applied to a Q-Sepharose fast flow column (25 ml, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) that was equilibrated in the same buffer. The PGI eluted in a 125-ml linear gradient (0.0–0.7 m NaCl) at 0.27m NaCl. Active fractions were pooled and dialyzed against 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. The desalted PGI pool was applied to a hydroxyapatite column (20 ml, Bio-Rad) that was equilibrated in the same buffer. PGI activity eluted in a 200-ml linear gradient (20–500 mm potassium phosphate) at 140 mm potassium phosphate. Active fractions were pooled, the buffer was changed for a 50 mm Tris/HCl buffer, pH 7.6, by dialysis and the pool was loaded onto a Mono-Q HR 5/5 column (1 ml,Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) that was equilibrated in the same buffer. PGI activity eluted in a 30-ml linear gradient (0.0–0.7 mNaCl) at 0.18 m NaCl. Fractions showing PGI activity were pooled and concentrated 10-fold to a final volume of 100 µl. This concentrated pool was applied to a Superdex 200 HR 10/30 gel filtration column (24 ml, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) that was equilibrated with a 50 mm Tris/HCl buffer, pH 7.8, containing 100 mm NaCl, from which the protein eluted after 14.5 ml. The purified PGI was desalted in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.8, using a Microsep filter with a 10-kDa cutoff. The N-terminal sequence of the purified PGI was determined by the Edman degradation method. The sample was subjected to SDS-PAGE and electroblotted on a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane prior to analysis. The N-terminal amino acid sequence was used for BLAST search of the P. furiosus data base (www.genome.utah.edu), and identification of the PGI gene (pgiA, accession number AF381250, NCBI GenBankTM). The following primer set was designed to amplify this open reading frame by PCR: BG902 (5′- GCGCGTCATGATGTATAAGGAACCTTTTGGAGTG, sense) and BG903 (5′-GCGCGAAGCTTCTACTTTTTCCACCTGGGATTAT, antisense), withBspHI and HindIII restriction sites in bold. The 100-µl PCR mixture contained 100 ng of P. furiosusDNA, isolated as described before (13Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), 100 ng each of primer BG902 and BG903, 0.2 mm dNTPs, Pfu polymerase buffer, and 5 units of Pfu DNA polymerase and was subjected to 35 cycles of amplification (1 min at 94 °C, 1 min at 56 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C) on a DNA Thermal Cycler (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The PCR product was digested (BspHI/HindIII) and cloned into an NcoI/HindIII-digested pET24d vector, resulting in pLUW557, which was transformed into E. coli XL1 Blue and BL21(DE3). Sequence analysis on pLUW557 was done by the dideoxynucleotide chain termination method with a Li-Cor automatic sequencing system (model 4000L). Sequencing data were analyzed using the computer program DNASTAR. An overnight culture of E. coli BL21(DE3) containing pLUW557 was used as a 1% inoculum in 1 liter of Luria Bertani medium with 50 µg/ml kanamycin. Gene expression was induced by adding 0.1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at theA600 of 0.5. Growth was continued for 10 h at 37 °C, and cells were harvested by centrifugation (2,200 ×g for 20 min) and resuspended in 10 ml of 50 mmTris/HCl buffer, pH 7.6. The suspension was passed twice through a French press (100 megapascals), and cell debris was removed by centrifugation (10,000 × g for 20 min). The resulting supernatant was used for purification of the recombinant PGI. The E. colicell-free extract containing pLUW557 was heat-treated for 30 min at 80 °C, and precipitated proteins were removed by centrifugation. The heat-treated cell-free extract was filtered through a 0.45-µm filter and applied to a Mono-Q HR 5/5 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), equilibrated with 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.6. The PGI activity eluted at 0.18 m NaCl during a linear gradient of 0.0–1.0m NaCl. Active fractions were pooled and concentrated 10-fold to a final volume of 100 µl using a Microsep filter with a 10-kDa cutoff. The concentrated pool was loaded onto a Superdex 200 HR 10/30 gel filtration column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), equilibrated with 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.8, containing 100 mmNaCl. The recombinant PGI eluted at 14.5 ml. The purified enzyme was desalted in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.8, using a Microsep filter with a 10-kDa cutoff. Protein concentrations were determined with Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250 as described before (14Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. The purity of the enzyme was checked by SDS-PAGE as described (15Kengen S.W.M. Luesink E.J. Stams A.J.M. Zehnder A.J.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 213: 305-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Protein samples for SDS-PAGE were heated for 5 min at 100 °C in an equal volume of sample buffer (0.1 m citrate-phosphate buffer, 5% SDS, 0.9% 2-mercaptoethanol, 20% glycerol, pH 6.8). PGI activity was determined in 100 mm MOPS buffer, pH 7.0 (50 °C). Enzyme preparations were added in 5–50 µl. Enzyme activity on fructose 6-phosphate was determined by measuring the formation of NADPH in a coupled assay with yeast glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. The assay mixture contained 0.5 mm NADP, 5 mm fructose 6-phosphate, and 0.35 units of d-glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. The activity of the PGI on glucose 6-phosphate was determined by measuring the decrease of NADH in a coupled assay withA. nidulans mannitol-1-phosphate dehydrogenase (12Ruijter G.J.G. Visser J. Biochimie. 1999; 81: 267-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The assay mixture contained 0.2 mm NADH, 5 mmglucose 6-phosphate, and 1.4 units of mannitol-1-phosphate dehydrogenase. One unit was defined as the amount of enzyme required to convert 1 µmol of fructose 6-phosphate or glucose 6-phosphate per min. All enzyme assays were performed at 50 °C. At this temperature the yeast and A. nidulans enzyme remained active, and theP. furiosus enzyme was sufficiently active to measure its activity. The auxiliary enzymes were present in excess, to ensure that the detected NADPH and NADH absorbance at 340 nm (ε = 6.3 mm−1 cm−1) corresponded to the PGI activity. Substrate specificity was investigated using purified PGI. The use of fructose 6-phosphate and glucose 6-phosphate as possible substrates for the PGI was tested using the standard enzyme assay. For the determination of mannose 6-phosphate as a possible substrate the standard enzyme assay for glucose 6-phosphate was used. Glucose, fructose, galactose, and mannose were tested as possible substrates by incubating an appropriate amount of PGI with 5 mm substrate for 30–60 min at 50 °C in 100 mm MOPS, pH 7.0. The reactions were stopped on ice/ethanol and the products were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography. The effect of cations (MgCl2 and MnCl2, 10 mm) and cofactors (ATP, NAD+, arsenate, and phosphate, 10 mm) on the isomerization of non-phosphorylated monosaccharides was investigated by the standard high performance liquid chromatography assay. Possible inhibitors (mannose 6-phosphate, fructose 1-phosphate, fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, fructose, glucose, mannose, galactose, pyruvate, phosphoenolpyruvate, AMP, ADP, or ATP) were tested on the activity of the P. furiosus PGI both in the direction of glucose 6-phosphate and fructose 6-phosphate formation by adding (1.25–10 mm) to the standard enzyme assays at 50 °C. Kinetic parameters were determined at 50 °C, in 100 mm MOPS buffer, pH 7.0, by varying the concentration of fructose 6-phosphate (0.05–3.50 mm) or glucose 6-phosphate (0.47–10.0 mm), respectively. 2.0 µg of purified PGI was used for these determinations. Data were analyzed by computer-aided (Program Tablecurve) fit to the Michaelis-Menten curve. The temperature optimum was determined in the direction of glucose 6-phosphate formation. Purified PGI (0.0064 mg/ml) was incubated in 1-ml crimp-sealed vials containing 100 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. The vials were submerged in an oil bath at temperatures varying from 30 to 120 °C, pre-heated for 2 min, and the enzyme reaction was started by injecting 20 mm fructose 6-phosphate. After 1, 2, and 3 min the reaction was stopped by transferring the vials on ice/ethanol, and the amount of glucose 6-phosphate formed was determined spectrophotometrically at room temperature by measuring the reduction of NADP (340 nm) in an assay with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. Corrections were made for the chemical isomerization of fructose 6-phosphate in the absence of PGI. Thermal inactivation of PGI was determined by incubating the enzyme (1.28 µg) in 200 µl of a pre-heated 100 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, at 60, 70, 80, and 90 °C in crimp-sealed vials, submerged in an oil bath. At certain time intervals, 200-µl aliquots were withdrawn and analyzed for activity in the standard assay. Studies were performed under Vmaxconditions, since substrate concentrations in the assays are ∼30-fold higher than the Km. The pH optimum was determined at 50 °C in 200 mm Tris maleate buffer over the pH range 6.0–9.5. Buffer pH values were adjusted at this temperature. Except for buffer and temperature, assay conditions were identical to analyze the enzyme's temperature optimum. In the case of fructose 6-phosphate conversion, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase was used as following enzyme. When glucose 6-phosphate was used as substrate, mannitol-1-phosphate dehydrogenase was used as following enzyme. RNA was isolated from maltose (10 mm) and pyruvate (40 mm) grown P. furiosus cells as described previously (16Ward D.E. Kengen S.W.M. Van der Oost J. de Vos W.M. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 2559-2566Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). For Northern blot analysis 15 µg of total RNA was separated on a 1.5% formaldehyde-agarose gel and transferred to a Hybond N+membrane. Probes were generated by PCR with the primers BG902 and BG903. The PCR product was purified by Qiaquick (Qiagen) and labeled by nick translation with [α-32P]dATP. The transcription start was determined with a fluorescence (IRD800)-labeled antisense oligonucleotide (5′-CTTTCCATGCCCTTTCATCAAC-3′, position 103–124 of thepgiA gene). Primer extension reactions were performed using the Reverse Transcription System (Promega) according to the instructions of the manufacturer with the following modifications. Hybridization of total RNA (15 µg) and oligonucleotide (5 pmol) was performed for 10 min at 68 °C before allowing to cool to room temperature. The reaction (20 µl final volume) was started by addition of dNTPs (1 mm), MgCl2 (5 mm), RNasin (20 units), and avian myeloblastosis virus-reverse transcriptase (22.5 units). After incubation for 30 min at 45 °C the reaction volume was diluted to 50 µl with 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.5, 1 µl of RNase A (5 mg/ml) was added and the sample was incubated for 10 min at 37 °C. cDNA was precipitated with ethanol, dissolved in 3 µl of loading buffer, and 1 µl was applied to a sequencing gel in parallel with the sequencing reactions obtained with the same oligonucleotide. The sequence alignment of homologs of the P. furious PGI was generated with T-coffee (17Notredame C. Higgins D.G. Heringa J. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 8: 205-217Crossref Scopus (5337) Google Scholar) followed by small, manual refinements. A neighbor joining (18Saitou N. Nei M. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1987; 4: 406-425PubMed Google Scholar) tree of the aligned sequences was generated with clustalX (19Jeanmougin F. Thompson J.D. Gouy M. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 403-405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2360) Google Scholar). Bootstrap values above 60 out of 100 are indicated. A secondary structure prediction was generated with Profile-based neural network system from HeiDelberg (20Rost B. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 226: 525-539Crossref Google Scholar). Purification of theP. furiosus PGI was performed aerobically at ambient temperature. PGI was purified from a P. furiosus cell-free extract using a number of conventional chromatographic steps (TableI). Anion exchange chromatography (Q-Sepharose Fast Flow) and gel filtration (Superdex 200 HR 10/30) resulted in PGI purification to apparent homogeneity as judged from SDS-PAGE analysis (Fig. 1). Additional native PAGE analysis resulted in a single protein band (not shown). The enzyme was purified 52.5-fold from the cell-free extract, suggesting that the PGI accounts for ∼2% of the soluble cellular protein inP. furiosus. The amino-terminal sequence has been identified by Edman degradation: MYKEPFGVKVNFETGIIEGA. This sequence had a perfect match with the N-terminal part of a 21-kDa hypothetical protein fromP. furiosus as identified from the genome sequence (www.genome.utah.edu).Table IPurification of PGI from P. furiosusPurification stepTotal activityProteinSpecific activity1-aSpecific activities were determined at 50 °C, with fructose 6-phosphate as substrate.Purification factorRecoveryunitsmg ml−1units mg−1-fold%Cell-free extract295.839.70.2761.0100Phenyl-Sepharose93.63.540.5882.131.6Q-Sepharose90.20.6702.9910.830.5Hydroxyapatite38.10.4263.5813.012.9Mono-Q25.89.923.8614.08.7Superdex20010.10.19614.552.53.41-a Specific activities were determined at 50 °C, with fructose 6-phosphate as substrate. Open table in a new tab The putative 570-base pair PGI-encoding gene (pgiA) was PCR amplified and cloned into pET24d, resulting in plasmid pLUW557. DNA sequence analysis of pLUW557 confirmed that the cloned pgiA gene showed the expected sequence. SDS-PAGE analysis of a heat-treated cell-free extract of E. coli BL21(DE3) harboring pLUW557 revealed an additional band of 23 kDa which was in good agreement with the calculated molecular mass (21.6 kDa) of the gene product. This band was absent in a heat-treated cell-free extract of E. coli BL21(DE3) carrying the pET24d vector without insert, in which no PGI activity was detected (not shown). In a heat-treated cell-free extract of E. coli BL21(DE3) harboring pLUW557, a PGI activity of 8.3 units/mg was measured at 50 °C, confirming that the cloned P. furiosus pgiA gene indeed encoded a PGI. The recombinant PGI was easily purified by two successive chromatographic steps, i.e. anion exchange chromatography and gel filtration. The recombinant enzyme eluted as the native enzyme, and was purified to apparent homogeneity as judged by SDS-PAGE analysis (Fig.1). The molecular mass of both the native and recombinant PGI as determined by gel filtration was 49.6 ± 0.3 kDa. SDS-PAGE analysis of the two enzymes resulted in identical bands of 23.5 ± 0.2 kDa, suggesting that the PGI is a homodimer. This homodimeric composition has been observed also for bacterial and eukaryal PGIs, although homotetrameric compositions occur as well. Furthermore, the P. furiosus PGI differs from all known PGIs by its subunit molecular mass, which is about half of its canonical counterparts (TableII). Moreover, the P. furiosusPGI, the first archaeal PGI described to date, exhibits the lowest pH optimum and highest temperature optimum of all known PGIs (TableII).Table IIComparison of PGI from P. furiosus with other PGIsDomainSpeciesT-opt.2-aT optimum determined for purified PGI.pH-opt.Molecular massKmRef.NativeSubunitFru-6-PGlu-6-P°CkDammArchaeaP. furiosus907.049.3 (α2)2-bThe proposed subunit composition of the native enzyme is shown in parentheses.23.50.711.57This workBacteriaB. caldotenax778–9202 (α4)50.6ND2.4621E. coli(I)ND2-bThe proposed subunit composition of the native enzyme is shown in parentheses.8.0125 (α2)590.2ND22E. coli(II)ND8.0230 (α4)590.2ND22EucaryaA. nigerND7.5–10118 (α2)600.320.4812T. bruceiND7.5–9.5ND640.12ND23YeastND7.5–9.5119 (α2)610.17ND23, 24RabbitND7.5–9.5125 (α2)640.12ND23, 252-a T optimum determined for purified PGI.2-b The proposed subunit composition of the native enzyme is shown in parentheses. Open table in a new tab The specific activities of the native and the recombinant PGI exhibited similar temperature or pH optima. The P. furiosus PGI showed reversible isomerization activity with fructose 6-phosphate and glucose 6-phosphate between pH 6.0 and 8.5, with an optimum at pH 7.0 (not shown). PGI showed maximal activity around 90 °C (Fig.2). From the Arrhenius plot between 30 and 90 °C, an inactivation energy of 41 kJ/mol was calculated. Thermal inactivation was determined at 60, 70, 80, and 90 °C and followed first-order kinetics (Fig. 3). With a half-life of ∼2.4 h at 90 °C it is the most thermostable PGI presently known. The second most thermostable PGI is the one fromBacillus caldotenax, that exhibits a half-life of ∼2 h at 65 °C (21Takama M. Nosoh Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1980; 87: 1821-1827Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar).Figure 3Thermal stability ofPGI. The native enzyme (0.0064 mg/ml) was preincubated at 90 °C in 100 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. Residual activity was measured at 50 °C using fructose 6-phosphate as substrate. The 100% activity corresponds to 18.6 units/mg for the native PGI. Thermal inactivation is plotted on logarithmic scale to demonstrate first-order kinetics. The recombinant PGI showed similar inactivation profiles at the respective temperatures as the native PGI (not shown). Half-lifes of 1500, 300, 230, and 143 min were calculated at 60 (♦), 70 (▪), 80 (▴), and 90 °C (●), respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The purified enzyme only showed activity in the isomerization of fructose 6-phosphate and glucose 6-phosphate (5 mm), with specific activities at 50 °C of 14.5 and 29.1 units/mg, respectively, pH 7.0. The PGI activity was not affected by addition of cations (Mg2+ or Mn2+), nor by addition of 10 mm EDTA to the assay mixture. Under the tested conditions the enzyme did not convert mannose 6-phosphate to fructose 6-phosphate. The PGI from Escherichia intermedia has been reported to catalyze the isomerization of non-phosphorylated sugars, like fructose and glucose, but only in the presence of arsenate (26Nataka M. Yoshimura S. Agric. Biol. Chem. 1964; 28: 510-516Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The purified enzyme from P. furiosus was unable to isomerize non-phosphorylated sugars like glucose, fructose, mannose, and galactose both in the absence or presence of cofactors like arsenate and phosphate. This suggests that the phosphoryl group at the C-6 position of fructose 6-phosphate and glucose 6-phosphate plays an important role in substrate recognition of the P. furiosusPGI. The native P. furiosus PGI showed Michaelis-Menten kinetics at 50 °C, Km values of 0.63 ± 0.07 and 1.99 ± 0.11 mm for fructose 6-phosphate and glucose 6-phosphate, respectively, and Vmax values of 20.1 ± 0.73 and 34.3 ± 0.71 units/mg for fructose 6-phosphate and glucose 6-phosphate, respectively.Km values and Vmax values determined for the recombinant PGI were in the same order of magnitude, with Km values of 0.42 ± 0.03 and 2.00 ± 0.17 mm for fructose 6-phosphate and glucose 6-phosphate, respectively, and Vmax values of 19.2 ± 0.37 and 47.7 ± 1.40 units/mg for fructose 6-phosphate and gl"
https://openalex.org/W2036735884,"SNARE proteins are required for intracellular membrane fusion. In the neuron, the plasma membrane SNAREs syntaxin 1a and SNAP25 bind to VAMP2 found on neurotransmitter-containing vesicles. These three proteins contain “SNARE regions” that mediate their association into stable tetrameric coiled-coil structures. Syntaxin 1a contributes one such region, designated H3, and SNAP25 contributes two SNARE regions to the fusogenic complex with VAMP2. Syntaxin 1a H3 (syn1aH3) and SNAP25 can form a stable assembly, which can then be bound by VAMP2 to form the full SNARE complex. Here we show that syn1aH3 can also form a stable but kinetically trapped complex with the N-terminal SNARE region of SNAP25 (S25N). The crystal structure of this complex reveals an extended parallel four-helix bundle similar to that of the core SNARE and the syn1aH3·SNAP25 complexes. The inherent ability of syn1aH3 and S25N to associate stably in vitro implies that the intracellular fusion machinery must prevent formation of, or remove, any non-productive complexes. Comparison with the syn1aH3·SNAP25 complex suggests that the linkage of the N- and C-terminal SNAP25 SNARE regions is kinetically advantageous in preventing formation of the non-productive syn1aH3·S25N complex. We also demonstrate that the syn1aH3·S25N complex can be disassembled by α-SNAP and N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor. SNARE proteins are required for intracellular membrane fusion.

Communication between these membrane compartments is essential to ensure that proteins and other molecules are transported and segregated into appropriate organelles within the cell. This is achieved through cargo-containing vesicles that bud from donor membranes and are transported to acceptor membranes where they fuse. Such a process allows local rearrangement of lipid bilayers while maintaining the overall structural integrity of the membrane compartment. Membrane fusion is mediated in part by a large family of compartment-specific proteins known as SNAREs1 (soluble NSF attachment protein receptors) that are localized on vesicle or target membranes (1Rothman J.E. Warren G. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 220-233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar, 2Jahn R. Südhof T.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 863-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar). In neurons, the SNAREs syntaxin 1a (syn1a), SNAP25, and VAMP2 participate in fusing neurotransmitter-filled vesicles with the plasma membrane of the cell, allowing neurotransmitter molecules to be released into the synaptic cleft. VAMP2 (also known as synaptobrevin) is found on the vesicle membrane and contains a characteristic “SNARE region” heptad repeat sequence followed by a single C-terminal membrane-spanning segment (3Bennett M.K. Calakos N. Scheller R.H. Science. 1992; 257: 255-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (1060) Google Scholar). Syntaxin 1a and SNAP25 are localized to the presynaptic membrane. The primary structure of syntaxin 1a consists of an N-terminal domain termed Habc, a SNARE region termed H3, and a single C-terminal membrane-spanning anchor (4Bennett M.K. Garcı́a-Arrarás J.E.

SNAP25 contains two SNARE regions, designated S25N and S25C, that are separated by a linker region containing four palmitoylated cysteines that tether the protein to the membrane (6Oyler G.A.

The coiled-coil structure formed by the four kinds of SNARE motif is referred to as the “core” SNARE complex. It is hypothesized that the energy associated with SNARE complex assembly serves to drive membranes into close apposition, which may then directly or indirectly lead to fusion (9Fasshauer D. Otto H. Eliason W.K. Jahn R. Brünger A.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28036-28041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar,14Weber T. Zemelman B.V. McNew J.A. Westermann B. Gmachl M. Parlati F. Söllner T.H. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1998; 92: 759-772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1989) Google Scholar). Because of their high stabilities, energy is required to disassemble the SNARE complexes for future rounds of fusion (15Mayer A. Wickner W. Haas A. Cell. 1996; 85: 83-94Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). The ATPase NSF (N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor) and the mediator protein α-SNAP (soluble NSF attachment protein) are responsible for SNARE disassembly. Homologues of the neuronal SNARE proteins are associated with various intracellular compartments, where they presumably mediate fusion during vesicle trafficking between organelles (1Rothman J.E. Warren G. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 220-233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar, 16Rothman J.E.

Nature. 1993; 362: 318-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (2589) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of the neuronal core SNARE complex revealed 16 layers of interactions, of which 15 are hydrophobic-packing interactions (13Sutton R.B. Fasshauer D. Jahn R. Brünger A.T. Nature. 1998; 395: 347-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (1881) Google Scholar). The central layer, however, features the interaction of Arg56 from VAMP2 with glutamines from syn1a, S25N, and S25C. This layer, known as the “zero” or “polar” layer, is highly conserved among SNARE proteins. The presence of Arg or Gln at this position, as well as other characteristic residues, serves to classify SNAREs into one of the four families (VAMP, syntaxin, S25N, or S25C). VAMP homologues all contain a SNARE region followed by a single C-terminal transmembrane-spanning segment, and in some cases they also have a small N-terminal domain (18Gonzalez L.C.J. Weis W.I. Scheller R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24203-24211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 19Tochio H. Tsui M.M.K. Banfield D.K. Zhang M. Science. 2001; 293: 698-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The syntaxin proteins are characterized by an N-terminal Habc domain, the H3 SNARE region, and a C-terminal membrane-spanning anchor (4Bennett M.K. Garcı́a-Arrarás J.E. Elferink L.A. Peterson K. Fleming A.M. Hazuka C.D. Scheller R.H. Cell. 1993; 74: 863-873Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar, 5Fernandez I. Ubach J. Bulubova I. Zhang X. Südhof T.C. Rizo J. Cell. 1998; 94: 841-849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). The SNAP25 family of proteins contains two SNARE regions, with homology to either the N (S25N)- or C (S25C)-terminal SNARE region of neuronal SNAP25 (20Bock J.B. Matern H.T. Peden A.A. Scheller R.H. Nature. 2001; 409: 839-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). In some cases, for example SNAP25, the S25N and S25C SNARE regions are fused into a single polypeptide chain separated by a linker region, whereas in others the N- and C-terminal SNARE regions are located on separate proteins and may contain domains in addition to the SNARE region (20Bock J.B. Matern H.T. Peden A.A. Scheller R.H. Nature. 2001; 409: 839-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). Assembly of SNARE complexes appears to be tightly regulated in neuronal exocytosis and perhaps in other transport steps as well. For example, the N-terminal region of syn1a interacts with its own H3 domain (8Calakos N. Bennett M.K. Peterson K.E. Scheller R.H. Science. 1994; 263: 1146-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar, 21Fiebig K.M. Rice L.M. Pollock E. Brünger A.T. Nat. Struct.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4372-4382Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar), generating a conformation that binds tightly to the regulatory factor neuronal Sec1 (nSec1) (22Dulubova I. Sugita S. Hill S.

The details of the events that occur downstream of the syn1a·nSec1 interaction remain obscure. However, several lines of evidence suggest a temporal order of association between the SNAREs that precedes fusion (25Chen Y.A. Scales S.J. Patel S.M. Doung Y.-C. Scheller R.H. Cell. 1999; 97: 165-174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar, 26Nicholson K.L. Munson M. Miller R.B. Filip T.J. Fairman R. Hughson F.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 793-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that intermediates exist at several stages along the pathway to full SNARE complex assembly. The characterization of potential intermediates in SNARE complex assembly thus provides important information for understanding the processes involved in SNARE-mediated membrane fusion. A complex composed of syn1aH3 and SNAP25 in a 2:1 ratio has been characterized and found to assemble into a parallel four-stranded coiled coil resembling the core SNARE complex (27Fasshauer D. Bruns D. Shen B. Jahn R. Brünger A.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4582-4590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 28Xiao W. Poirier M.A. Bennett M.K. Shin Y.-K. Nat.

Chem. 2001; 276: 13169-13177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). In an in vitro study of the yeast proteins Sso1p, Sec9p, and Snc2p (syn1a, SNAP25, and VAMP2 homologues, respectively) involved in Golgi-to-plasma membrane transport, formation of the Sso1p·Sec9p complex relieved the kinetic inhibition of core SNARE complex assembly due to the Sso1p N-terminal domain (Habc) (26Nicholson K.L. Munson M. Miller R.B. Filip T.J. Fairman R. Hughson F.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 793-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). These data, in conjunction with the observation in vitro that VAMP2 can be rapidly incorporated into the neuronal syn1a·SNAP25 complex to generate the higher stability core complex, suggests that a syn1a·SNAP25 complex might lie on the pathway to full SNARE complex formation (9Fasshauer D. Otto H. Eliason W.K. Jahn R. Brünger A.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28036-28041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 21Fiebig K.M. Rice L.M. Pollock E. Brünger A.T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 117-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). However, biochemical studies of the pathway of SNARE assembly in a Ca2+-regulated cellular context suggest that VAMP2 and SNAP25 associate followed by syntaxin 1a binding (30Chen Y.A. Scales S.J. Scheller R.H. Neuron. 2001; 30: 161-170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Thus, the physiologically relevant pathway of SNARE assembly remains unclear at present. In this report, we demonstrate that syn1aH3 and the N-terminal half of SNAP25 (S25N) are sufficient to form an independent complex (also observed by Fasshauer et al. (27Fasshauer D. Bruns D. Shen B. Jahn R. Brünger A.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4582-4590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar)). The syn1aH3·S25N complex is mostly α-helical and of higher thermal stability than the syn1aH3·SNAP25 complex. The rate of syn1a·S25N complex assembly is unusually slow, but once the complex is formed it is kinetically restricted from forming the more stable core SNARE complex. The crystal structure of the syn1aH3·S25N complex consists of a parallel, four-stranded coiled coil, containing two copies each of syn1aH3 and S25N. The structure displays similarities to the core SNARE complex, and both complexes are substrates for NSF and α-SNAP. These results suggest that unproductive interactions among SNARE family members can occur and emphasize the importance of strict regulation of SNARE interactions in the cell.

Cell. 1990; 61: 709-721Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). Expression of GST-VAMP2 and His6-NSF was maximized by using BL21(DE3) RIL Codon Plus cells (Stratagene) and M15/pREP4 cells (Qiagen), respectively. Cells were grown in LB medium at 37 °C in the presence of 100 mg/liter ampicillin and induced with 1 mmisopropylthiogalactoside when the culture reached an optical density at 600 nm of 0.8–1.0. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in lysis buffer (250 mm NaCl, 20 mmTris, pH 7.9, 2 mm 2-mercaptoethanol (β-Me)), except for cells expressing His6-NSF. Cells were lysed in a French press after the addition of 1–2 mg DNase I (Sigma), and cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 90,100 × g (average value) for 30 min. GST fusion proteins were purified by affinity chromatography on glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma) in lysis buffer and then cleaved with thrombin (Sigma) for 1 h at 25 °C. GST-syn1a (residues 1–266) was eluted from glutathione beads with 10 mm reduced glutathione without prior cleavage by thrombin. Cell lysates containing His6-tagged-proteins (except for His6-NSF) were loaded onto Ni-NTA-agarose columns (Qiagen), washed with 10 column volumes of lysis buffer, and eluted with increasing concentrations of imidazole. Proteins used for binding assays were further purified on an S200 gel filtration column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in a buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm β-Me, and 20 mm Tris, pH 7.9, and proteins used for CD studies were purified by gel filtration in phosphate-buffered saline. For purification of His6-NSF, cells were resuspended in NSF lysis buffer (100 mm Hepes/KOH, pH 7.1, 500 mmKCl, 10 mm ATP, 10% glycerol, 2 mm β-Me, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and one Complete-EDTA free (Roche Diagnostics) protease inhibitor mixture tablet per 50 ml of cell lysate). Cells were lysed in a French press after the addition of 1–2 mg of DNase I (Sigma), and cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 90,100 × g (average value) for 30 min. The cell lysate was bound to Ni-NTA-agarose and washed with 10 column volumes of NSF lysis buffer, 5 column volumes of NSF wash buffer (25 mm Hepes, pH 7.1, 200 mm KCl, 2 mm ATP, 2 mm β-Me, 10% glycerol, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) containing 25 mm imidazole, and 5 column volumes NSF wash buffer containing 60 mm imidazole. NSF was eluted from Ni-NTA-agarose with 10 ml of NSF wash buffer containing 300 mm imidazole. The eluted protein was then loaded on a gel filtration column (S200 HR 26/60, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated in 25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 300 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, 5 mm β-Me, 1 mm ATP, and 1 mm EDTA. Fractions containing pure NSF (as determined by SDS-PAGE, data not shown) were pooled and concentrated. To prepare selenomethionine-substituted syn1aH3 (Se-syn1aH3) and S25N (Se-S25N) proteins, plasmids were transformed into B834 (Novagen) methionine auxotroph E. coli cells. The cells were grown in selective media (35Leahy D.J. Hendrickson W.A. Aukhil I. Erickson H.P. Science. 1992; 258: 987-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar) to allow for incorporation of selenomethionine. Protein expression and purification proceeded in the same way as the wild-type proteins. Both the Se·syn1aH3·S25N and syn1aH3·Se·S25N complexes formed and crystallized in the same way as the wild-type proteins. Purified syn1aH3 and S25N, syn1aH3 and SNAP23-N, syn4H3 and SNAP23-N, or syn7H3 and Vti1b were mixed in equimolar amounts at ∼100 µm and incubated for 3 h at 21 °C. The protein mixtures were then separated by gel filtration chromatography (Superdex S200 HR 26/60, Pharmacia) at 4 °C. Only the syn1aH3 and S25N proteins co-fractionated and eluted at a molecular weight consistent with a tetrameric assembly. Fractions containing pure syn1aH3·S25N complex (as determined by SDS-PAGE, data not shown) were concentrated to ∼15 mg/ml for crystallization. Crystals of the syn1aH3·S25N complex were obtained by vapor diffusion at 21 °C. Purified protein in a buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm β-Me, and 25 mm Tris, pH 8.0, was mixed with an equal volume of reservoir solution containing 1.6 m ammonium sulfate, 100 mm MES, pH 6.5, and 10 mm β-Me. Crystals appeared within 2 days and grew to approximately (150 µm3) in size. Prior to data collection, the crystals were flash-frozen at 100 K in Paratone-N (Exxon) oil. The native crystal used for refinement belongs to space group C2, with unit cell dimensions a = 59.4 Å, b = 65.8 Å,c = 80.1 Å, and β = 99.5°. Slight differences were observed in unit cell dimensions for different native crystals as well as for selenomethionine-substituted crystals. Native and multiwavelength anomalous dispersion (MAD) diffraction data were measured at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory using beamline 9-2 on a Quantum 4 charge-coupled device detector (Area Detector Systems Corp.). All data were measured at 100 K, and processed and scaled with Denzo/Scalepack (36Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38253) Google Scholar). MAD data were systematically measured from syn1aH3·Se·S25N crystals in 30° wedges using inverse beam geometry at three wavelengths. Data collection statistics are presented in Table I. All Patterson and phasing calculations were performed with the program CNS (37Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.-S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J.

Each copy of the S25N peptide contains 7 methionine residues (including the start methionine). Six selenium sites were located using difference Patterson techniques, and three additional sites were located from a difference Fourier map using phases from the initial six sites. Phases from nine sites were calculated using the Philips-Hodgson method and maximum-likelihood refinement (39Phillips J.C. Hodgson K.O. Acta Crystallogr. Sect.

Prior to refinement, a random subset (10.7%) of the data was removed and used as the test set for cross-validation. The model was initially refined by simulated annealing using the MLHL target in CNS against the high energy remote data (λ1), with the density-modified phases used as prior phase information. Subsequent refinement was carried out against the native data set. Subsequent rounds of model building using ςA-weighted 2Fo −Fc maps, positional minimization, and individual thermal factor refinement were then carried out to produce the final model. An overall anisotropic temperature factor correction was applied to the data throughout refinement, but the high degree of anisotropy in the data made tracing the ends of the helices difficult. An attempt was made to reduce the effects of the anisotropy by truncating the data at 2.4 Å. This reduced the number of reflections with measured intensities < 0 and improved the quality of Fo− Fc difference maps but did not significantly change the anisotropic temperature factor tensor.Table IIIRefinement statistics for syn1aH3·S25NR values and temperature factorsModel geometryNo. reflectionsBond length r.m.s.d.3-cr.m.s.d., root mean square deviation. from ideal0.007 (Å)Working set3-aThe Test set comprises a randomly selected subset of the data (10.7%) that was not included in the refinement of the model.

A 1 μg/ml volume of Stx1 or Stx2 in PBS was inoculated on MaxiSorp enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plates (Nunc) and incubated at 4 °C for 1 day. The wells were then washed with 1% BSA-PBS and blocked with 3% BSA-PBS at 37 °C for 1 h. After removing the blocking buffer, HuSAP serially diluted with 3% BSA-PBS was added to the wells, and the plates were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. After washing with 1% BSA-PBS, the wells were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h with rabbit anti-HuSAP serum (Biogenesis) diluted 4000-fold with 3% BSA-PBS. The wells were then washed with 1% BSA-PBS and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h with peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories) diluted 1:2000 with 3% BSA-PBS. After washing with 1% BSA-PBS, peroxidase activity was detected colorimetrically by adding TMB (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories). A 100-μl volume of a 1 × 105 cells/ml suspension of human renal adenocarcinoma ACHN cells in growth medium (Eagle’s minimum essential medium-10% fetal calf serum) was inoculated into 96-well flat-bottomed plates and incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO2 for 1 day. After removing the growth medium and adding 50 μl of fresh growth medium to the wells, 50 μl of the pre-incubated mixture of test sample and Stx2 (5–10 CD50) was added to each well. The neutralizing assay for the fractions from each purification step was performed according to method 1 below and for commercial HuSAP by methods 1 and 2 below. After incubation at 37 °C with 5% CO2 for 1 h, the mixture was removed, and the wells were washed once with growth medium. Next, 100 μl of growth medium was added, and the plates were incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO2 for 4 days. A 100-μl volume of 0.028% (w/v) neutral red (Merck) in growth medium was added, and incubation at 37 °C with 5% CO2 was continued for 1 h to stain the living cells. After washing the wells with PBS, 100 μl of 50% ethanol, 1% acetic acid solution was added to extract the dye, and the absorbance at 550 nm was measured. After incubation at 37 °C with 5% CO2 for 4 days, living cells were stained with neutral red and quantified as described above. Neutralizing activity was calculated according to the following formula: neutralization (%) = (A550(Stx2 + test sample) −A550(Stx2))/(A550(medium)− A550(Stx2)) × 100. SDS-PAGE was performed according to Laemmli, using 4–20% polyacrylamide gradient slab gel (Daiichi Pure Chemicals), and the separated proteins were silver-stained (Wako Pure Chemicals). Throughout the purification procedures, the protein concentration was estimated by BCA protein assay or micro BCA protein assay (Pierce) with BSA as a standard. Spectrophotometric determinations were made in a Shimadzu UV-160A spectrophotometer. Protein sequencing was performed using an Applied Biosystems 494 protein sequencer. Bitzan et al. (1Bitzan M.

However, we were unable to detect any Stx2-neutralizing activity by human HDL (data not shown). Because analysis of this Stx2-neutralizing factor is important to understanding the pathology of STEC, we purified this factor from human plasma and identified it. Plasma obtained from one healthy male donor was used as the starting material. Purification was serially carried out by Con A-Sepharose, DEAE-Sepharose, hydroxyapatite, and gel-filtration HPLC. Chromatography on Con A-Sepharose—The human plasma was applied to a Con A-Sepharose column (column bed volume, 40 ml) equilibrated with PBS, and the column was thoroughly washed with PBS and then serially eluted with 0.1 md-mannose in PBS and 0.5 m α-methyl-d-mannoside in PBS. As shown in Fig. 1 a, Stx2-neutralizing activity was observed in the eluate from 0.1md-mannose in PBS. This eluate was applied to a PD-10 column equilibrated with 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) to equilibrate the same buffer. Chromatography on DEAE-Sepharose—The eluate from the PD-10 column was applied to a DEAE-Sepharose column (column bed volume, 5 ml) equilibrated with 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), and the column was serially washed with 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 0.1 m NaCl in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), then developed with a linear salt gradient from 0.1 to 0.3 mNaCl in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), and finally washed with 2m NaCl in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). As shown in Fig. 1 b, Stx2-neutralizing activity was observed in the eluate at about 0.2–0.24 m NaCl in 10 mmTris-HCl (pH 8.0). These fractions were collected and applied to a PD-10 column equilibrated with 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 6.8) to equilibrate the same buffer. Chromatography on Hydroxyapatite—The eluate was applied to a hydroxyapatite column (column bed volume, 3 ml) equilibrated with 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 6.8). The column was washed with 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 6.8), then developed with a linear gradient of 50–250 mm sodium phosphate (pH 6.8), and finally washed with 250 mm sodium phosphate (pH 6.8). As shown in Fig. 1 c, Stx2-neutralizing activity was observed mainly in the eluate at ∼125–250 mm sodium phosphate (pH 6.8). Fractions of the eluate at ∼200–250 mm sodium phosphate (pH 6.8) were collected, frozen, and dried in a rotary evaporator. The dried sample was dissolved in distilled water. Chromatography by Gel-filtration HPLC—The pool of the eluate from Step 3 was applied to a gel-filtration HPLC (Superose 6 HR 10/30) using PBS as the elution buffer. As shown in Fig. 1 d, Stx2-neutralizing activity was observed in the peak fractions, and the peak fractions (fractions 27–29) were pooled. SDS-PAGE analysis of the peak fractions obtained by gel-filtration HPLC indicated a single staining band of 25 kDa (Fig. 2). This Stx2-neutralizing factor was purified about 1270-fold and the yield of the purified protein was 2.5% (Table I).Table ISummary of the purification of Stx2-neutralizing factor in human plasmaStepVolumeActivitya1 unit = the dilution of the sample that showed 50% neutralizing activity.ProteinSpecific activityPurificationYieldmlunitsμgunits/μg-fold%Human plasma3529,4001,860,0000.01581100Con A7219,800168,0000.1187.567.3DEAE8.612,9003,2403.9825243.9Hydroxyapatite229,06461714.793030.8Gel-filtration474037201,2702.5a 1 unit = the dilution of the sample that showed 50% neutralizing activity.

Twenty N-terminal amino acid residues could be analyzed, and the sequence obtained (HTDLSGKVFVFPRESVTDHV) corresponded completely to the human serum amyloid P component, which is a member of the human plasma pentraxin family consisting of a complex of 10 identical 25-kDa subunits non-covalently associated in two pentameric rings interacting face-to-face (15Emsley J.

To confirm that the Stx2-neutralizing factor in human blood is HuSAP, we tested the Stx2-binding activity and the Stx2-neutralizing activity of commercially available HuSAP in vitro. The binding capacity of HuSAP to Stxs was estimated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. As shown in Fig. 3, HuSAP bound to Stx2 but not to Stx1. The Stx2-neutralizing activity of HuSAP was also tested by a cell cytotoxicity assay. As shown in Fig. 4, HuSAP was found to neutralize Stx2 cytotoxicity. Because commercial HuSAP showed Stx2 binding and neutralizing activity, we ultimately concluded that the Stx2-neutralizing factor in human blood was HuSAP.Figure 4In vitro Stx2-neutralizing activity of commercial HuSAP. The in vitro neutralizing assay was performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The black circles represent the results for incubation of HuSAP and Stx2 with the target cells for 1 h.

HuSAP shows no polymorphism or heterogeneity, and no deficiency of HuSAP has been reported, suggesting that it has important functions. However, there has been no report on the function of HuSAP in STEC infections. Surveillance studies have shown a strong statistical association between the Stx2 gene and severity of disease (8Ostroff S.M. Tarr P.I. Neill M.A. Lewis J.H. Hargrett-Bean N. Kobayashi J.M. J.

On the other hand, anti-Stx1 monoclonal antibodies could not rescue them (10Wadolkowski E.A. Sung L.M. Burris J.A. Samuel J.E. O'Brien A.D. Infect.

It is unclear why only some STEC-infected patients develop HUS despite the presence of Stx2-neutralizing factor (HuSAP) in their blood. This phenomenon can be explained by hypothesizing that HuSAP acts as a carrier protein of Stx2 as well as a Stx2-neutralizing factor in humans as described below. Caprioli et al. (2Caprioli A. Luzzi I. Seganti L. Marchetti M. Karmali M. Clarke I. Boyd B. Karmali M.A. Goglio A.G. Recent Advances in Verocytotoxin-producing Escherichia coli Infections. Elsvier Science Publishing, Amsterdam1994: 353-356Google Scholar) have reported that the Stx2-neutralizing activity in serum is unique to humans. We tested mouse, rat, hamster, guinea pig, rabbit, chicken, dog, pig, sheep, deer, goat, horse, bovine, and monkey sera and confirmed that they were negative for in vitro Stx2-neutralizing activity (data not shown). Mice challenged with STEC had a higher mortality rate (29Lindgren S.W. Melton A.R. O'Brien A.D. Infect. Immun. 1993; 61: 3832-3842Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Kurioka T. Yunou Y. Kita E. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 1726-1734Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas the rate of occurrence of HUS in STEC-infected patients is 8–14% (31Tarr P.I. Infect. Dis. 1995; 20: 1-10Crossref Scopus (343) Google Scholar,32Bell B.P. Griffin P.M. Lozano P. Christie D.L. Kobayashi L.M. Tarr P.I. Pediatrics. 1997; 100: E12Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), and the mortality rate is much lower. HuSAP probably neutralizes Stx2 cytotoxicity in human blood, thus decreasing the frequency of progression to HUS. As shown in Fig. 4, the in vitro Stx2-neutralizing activity of HuSAP was much lower when the incubation time of HuSAP and Stx2 with the target cells was changed to 4 days instead of 1 h, suggesting that the binding between HuSAP and Stx2 is relatively weak and that Stx2 was gradually released from HuSAP day after day and finally killed the target cells. HuSAP may act as a carrier protein of Stx2 to the target cells. Another possibility is that HuSAP is a factor that reduces the immunogenicity of Stx2 by binding to the antigenic site of Stx2, for the following reasons. First, no Stx2-neutralizing antibodies were produced in humans infected with STEC (33Caprioli A. Luzzi I. Rosmini F. Pasquini P. Cirrincione R. Gianviti A. Matteucci M.C. Rizzoni G. J. Infect. Dis. 1992; 166: 154-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Second, in vitroneutralizing activity against Stx1, but not Stx2, has been detected in intravenous immunoglobulins (34Ashkenazi S. Cleary T.G. Lopez E. Pickering L.K. J. Pediatr. 1988; 113: 1008-1014Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 35Morooka T. Umeda A. Winkler M. Karmali M.A. Amako K. Oda T. Acta Paediatr. Jpn. 1996; 38: 294-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Third, studies on serum amyloid P component knockout mice have suggested that serum amyloid P component has an important physiological role in inhibiting the formation of pathogenic autoantibodies against chromatin and DNA (36Bickerstaff M.C.M. Botto M. Hutchinson W.L. Herbert J. Tennent G.A. Bybee A. Mitchell D.A. Cook H.T. Butler P.J.G. Walport M.J. Pepys M.B. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 694-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). In summary, this study has confirmed that HuSAP is the factor in human plasma that binds to Stx2 and neutralizes it in vitro. HuSAP may function not only as a Stx2-neutralizing factor in STEC infections but as a carrier of Stx2 as well. However, further studies will be necessary to clarify more precisely the physiological role of HuSAP in STEC pathology."

The signaling mechanisms utilized by chemoattractants to activate NF-κB in human peripheral blood monocytes are poorly defined. We previously demonstrated that fMet-Leu-Phe (fMLP) stimulates NF-κB activation, and this function of fMLP requires phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K). Here we present evidence that fMLP activates RhoA and that fMLP-induced NF-κB activation requires this small GTPase. Stimulation of monocytes with fMLP rapidly activated RhoA as well as NF-κB, and their activation was markedly reduced by pertussis toxin treatment. Pretreatment of monocyte with a RhoA inhibitor, C3 transferase fromClostridium botulinum, effectively blocked fMLP-induced NF-κB activation as well as interleukin-1β gene expression. A dominant negative form of RhoA (T19N) also inhibited fMLP-stimulated reporter gene expression in a κB-dependent manner. Cotransfection of the monocytic THP1 cells with a constitutively active form of RhoA (Q63L) with the promoter reporter plasmid results in a marked increase in NF-κB-mediated reporter gene expression. Furthermore, the PI3K inhibitors wortmannin and LY294002 block RhoA activation induced by fMLP.

When exposed to chemoattractants, such as formyl peptide, leukocytes become rapidly activated. The bacterial tripeptide fMet-Leu-Phe (fMLP)1 is able to activate all major functions of neutrophils and is a prototypical ligand for the N-formyl peptide receptor (FPR), which contains seven putative transmembrane domains characteristic of the G protein-coupled receptor of the rhodopsin family (1Boulay F.

Pretreatment of the peripheral blood mononuclear cells with pertussis toxin abolishes fMLP-stimulated cytokine synthesis, suggesting that a Gαicontaining heterotrimeric G protein may mediate the process (3Arbour N.

Invest. 1996; 98: 2042-2049Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). NF-κB is of paramount importance to immune cell function because of its ability to activate the transcription of many proinflammatory immediate-early genes (9Sen R. Baltimore D. Cell. 1986; 46: 705-716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1924) Google Scholar, 10Baeuerle P.A. Henkel T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 32: 141-179Crossref Scopus (4584) Google Scholar). NF-κB is a multiprotein transcription activator originally found to bind a decameric enhancer sequence in the gene for the immunoglobulin κ light chains. In leukocytes, NF-κB activation results in the transcription of immediate-early genes that encode IL-2, IL-6, IL-8, TNFα, MCP-1, GM-CSF, as well as several adhesion molecules (10Baeuerle P.A. Henkel T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 32: 141-179Crossref Scopus (4584) Google Scholar). Numerous stimuli can activate NF-κB, including the bacterial components lipopolysaccharide, as well as other proinflammatory factors including IL-1 and TNFα. We recently reported that chemoattractants (fMLP, PAF, C3a, and C5a) can activate the transcription factor NF-κB (7Pan Z.K. Kravchenko V.V. Ye R.D. J. Biol.

Acta. 1998; 1443: 90-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and provided the evidence that fMLP-induced NF-κB activation is essential for proinflammatory cytokine synthesis in human peripheral blood monocytes (13Pan Z.K. Chen L.-Y. Cochrane C.G. Zuraw B.L. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 404-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). We further showed that fMLP-induced NF-κB activation required PI3K activity, and this activation in monocytes is mediated by p85/p110 heterdimeric PI3K (13Pan Z.K. Chen L.-Y. Cochrane C.G. Zuraw B.L. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 404-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). GTPases of the Rho family exist in both GDP-bound inactive (GDP-Rho) and GTP-bound active (GTP-Rho) forms. When cells are stimulated with different ligands, GDP-Rho is converted to GTP-Rho, which binds to specific targets and then exerts its biological functions. Low molecular weight G proteins of the Rho family (consisting of Cdc42, Rac, and RhoA) have been shown to regulate actin cytoskeletons, focal adhesion complex formation, cell aggregation, and cell motility (14Tominaga T. Sugie K. Hirata M. Morii N. Fukata J. Uchida A. Imura H. Narumiya S. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1529-1537Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 15Ridley A.J. Hall A.

The function of these small G proteins in leukocyte cytokine gene transcription, however, has not been previously addressed. Recent reports indicate that Rho GTPases regulate c-fostranscription activation (17Hill C.S. Wynne J. Treisman R. Cell. 1995; 81: 1159-1170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1202) Google Scholar), that constitutively active Rho proteins can activate NF-κB, and that TNFα-induced activation of NF-κB in NIH-3T3 cells is dependent on Cdc42 and RhoA (18Perona R. Montaner S. Saniger L. Sanchez-Perez I. Bravo R. Lacal J.C. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 463-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). Chang et al. (19Chang J.H. Pratt J.C. Sawasdikosol S. Kapeller R. Burakoff S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4986-4993Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) demonstrated that Rho activation is also involved in AP-1-mediated transcription in Jurkat cells.Clostridium difficile toxin B, which inactivates Rho family proteins including RhoA, Rac, and Cdc42, has been reported to reduce the lipopolysaccharide-induced IL-8 expression in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (20Hippenstiel S. Soeth S. Kellas B. Fuhrmann O. Seybold J. Krull M. Eichel-Streiber C. Goebeler M. Ludwig S. Suttorp N. Blood. 2000; 95: 3044-3051Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Despite an apparent role of the Rho GTPases in gene expression, relatively little is known about the molecular mechanisms of Rho signaling in gene transcription. In this study we therefore investigated the role of Rho GTPase in the signaling events that lead to NF-κB activation in fMLP-stimulated human peripheral blood monocytes. We found that stimulation of monocytes with fMLP rapidly activated RhoA as well as NF-κB in a pertussis toxin-sensitive manner. Furthermore, inhibition of RhoA activity blocked fMLP-induced NF-κB activation. These results indicate that fMLP stimulates RhoA and NF-κB activation and that the RhoA activity is required to mediate this effect in human peripheral blood monocytes. fMLP and recombinant human C5a were obtained from Sigma. PAF was obtained from Calbiochem. Human C3a was obtained from Advanced Research Technologies (San Diego, CA). Pertussis and cholera toxins were purchased from Calbiochem. Recombinant murine TNFα was kindly provided by V. Kravchencko (Scripps Research Institute). A monoclonal antibody against RhoA was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Oligonucleotides and their complementary strands for electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) were from Promega (Madison, WI), with the sequence of (underlined), 5′-AGTTGAGGGGACTTTCCCAGGC-3′ (NF-κB) (21Pan Z.K. Ye R.D. Christiansen S.C. Jagels M.K. Bokoch G.M. Zuraw B.L. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 3038-3045PubMed Google Scholar). The NF-κB oligonucleotide has been shown to represent a consensus κB sequence (9Sen R. Baltimore D. Cell. 1986; 46: 705-716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1924) Google Scholar, 23Lenardo M.J. Baltimore D. Cell. 1989; 58: 227-229Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1255) Google Scholar). Double-stranded oligonucleotide (5 pmol) was32P-labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase. [γ-32P]ATP (>5000 Ci/mmol) was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. The RhoA dominant negative (T19N), constitutively active (Q63L) pCMV plasmids, and recombinant Clostridium botulinumC3 transferase were obtained as described previously (21Pan Z.K. Ye R.D. Christiansen S.C. Jagels M.K. Bokoch G.M. Zuraw B.L. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 3038-3045PubMed Google Scholar). Heparinized human peripheral blood from health donors was fractionated on Percoll (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) density gradients. Mononuclear cells and neutrophils were initially separated by centrifugation through a 55%/74% discontinuous Percoll gradient. Monocytes were further prepared from the mononuclear cell population with gelatin/plasma-coated flasks as described previuosly (7Pan Z.K. Kravchenko V.V. Ye R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7787-7790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The purity of monocytes was greater than 85–90% as determined by staining with an anti-CD14 monoclonal antibody (Coulter Immunology, Miami, FL), and cell viability was greater than 95% as measured by trypan blue exclusion. Monocytes were resuspended in RPMI 1640 medium (Irvine Scienfic, Santa Ana, CA) with 10%(V/V) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 µg/ml), andl-glutamine (2 mm; Irvine Scienfic, Santa Ana, CA). When activated, Rho undergoes GDP-GTP exchange, and activated Rho can thus be detected by analyzing GTP-bound Rho. RhoA activity was detected by the method recently described by Ren et al. (24Ren X.D. Kiosses W.B. Schwartz M.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 578-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (1359) Google Scholar). This assay utilizes the Rho-binding domain (RBD) from the effector protein Rhotekin as a probe to specifically isolate the active forms of RhoA. Human peripheral blood monocytes (5 × 106) were stimulated with fMLP or control media and then lysed (lysis buffer: 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 500 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 µg/ml each of leupeptin and aprotinin). Equal volumes of lysates were incubated with GST-RBD (20 µg) beads at 4 °C for 45 min. The beads were washed three times with a Tris buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 10 mm MgCl2, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 µg/ml each of leupeptin and aprotinin. Bound Rho proteins were detected by Western blotting using a monoclonal antibody against RhoA (Santa Cruz, Inc.). The amount of RBD-bound Rho was normalized to the total amount of Rho in cell lysates for comparison of Rho activity in different samples. Nuclear extracts were prepared from human peripheral blood monocytes using a modified method of Dignam et al.(25Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9150) Google Scholar), and EMSA were performed using 2.5 µg of the nuclear extract as described previously (7Pan Z.K. Kravchenko V.V. Ye R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7787-7790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The promoter:reporter plasmid pIκB-CAT (WT-IκB-CAT) contains a κB-like enhancer from the promoter region of the IκB gene. This enhancer was deleted in the plasmid MU-IκB-CAT. Both constructs were described previously in Refs. 21Pan Z.K. Ye R.D. Christiansen S.C. Jagels M.K. Bokoch G.M. Zuraw B.L. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 3038-3045PubMed Google Scholar and 26Chiao P.J. Miyamoto S. Verma I.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 28-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar. The plasmid pBLCAT2 was the parent vector for the IκB constructs. The plasmid pCMVβ (CLONTECH) was used as a control for monitoring the transfection efficiency by the expression of β-galactosidase. The plasmid DNA was transiently transfected into THP1 cells by electroporation. After 6 h, the DNA-containing medium was removed and the cells were washed with PBS and incubated with normal medium for 16 h. The cells were then stimulated with agonists for the indicated time and harvested by scraping. Crude cell extracts were prepared for the measurement of CAT activity with the use of [14C]chloramphenicol (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as the substrate and thin layer chromatography (TLC) for the separation of the native from the acetylated forms as described previously (21Pan Z.K. Ye R.D. Christiansen S.C. Jagels M.K. Bokoch G.M. Zuraw B.L. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 3038-3045PubMed Google Scholar,27Gorman C.M. Moffat L.F. Howard B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 1044-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (5292) Google Scholar). After development, the extent of CAT activity was measured using the ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics). To assess the role of Rho GTPase in fMLP-induced NF-κB activation, we examined the consequences of preincubating cells with a specific Rho inhibitor. The C3 transferase is an exotoxin produced byClostridium botulinum that specifically inhibits the Rho small GTP-binding proteins (Rho A, B, and C) but does not inhibit Rac or Cdc42 (28Aktorirs K. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 827-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Following pretreatment with 10 µg/ml of recombinant C3 transferase or media control for 16 h, human monocytes were stimulated with fMLP or TNFα for 60 min and NF-κB activation assessed by EMSA. The DNA binding activity of NF-κB was potently induced by fMLP and TNFα (Fig.1A, lanes 2 and3), fMLP-induced NF-κB activation was completely inhibited in monocytes pretreated with C3 transferase (Fig. 1A,lane 5); however, the C3 transferase only marginally affected TNFα-induced NF-κB activation (Fig. 1A,lane 6). These results suggest that RhoA is required for fMLP-induced but not TNFα-induced NF-κB activation. We next examined the dose response of the inhibitory effect of C3 transferase on fMLP-induced NF-κB activation. As shown in Fig. 1B, C3 transferase at doses greater than or equal to 5 µg/ml significantly inhibited fMLP-induced NF-κB activation. NF-κB is known to stimulate the transcription of many inflammatory genes, including a large number of cytokines (9Sen R. Baltimore D. Cell. 1986; 46: 705-716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1924) Google Scholar). Preincubation with recombinant C3 transferase also inhibited fMLP-stimulated IL-1β synthesis (Fig.1C), but only marginally affected TNFα-induced IL-1β synthesis (Fig. 1C, lane 5 versus lane 3). The results presented above demonstrate that inhibition of RhoA activity abrogates fMLP-induced NF-κB activation. We next examined whether fMLP would induce increased RhoA activity in human peripheral blood monocytes. At various times following stimulation, monocytes were lysed and total cell lysates incubated with GST or GST-RBD beads. Immunoblotting of the bound proteins was performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Both fMLP and other tested leukocyte chemoattractants (PAF, C3a, and C5a) stimulated increased RhoA activity (Fig. 2A). fMLP stimulated a time-dependent increase in RhoA activity (Fig.2B). The fMLP-induced increase of RhoA activity was seen within 5 min of stimulation and peaked at 5–10 min. The kinetics of fMLP-induced RhoA activity preceded that of fMLP-induced NF-κB activation (13Pan Z.K. Chen L.-Y. Cochrane C.G. Zuraw B.L. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 404-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), consistent with a role for RhoA in the activation of NF-κB. We previously demonstrated that fMLP-induced NF-κB activation in peripheral blood mononuclear cells is mediated through the fMLP receptor (11Browning D.D. Pan Z.K. Prossnitz E.R. Ye R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7995-8001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), a member of the seven transmembrane G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. The identity of the heterotrimeric G proteins coupling the fMLP receptor to RhoA activity and NF-κB activation in monocytes has not been elucidated. We therefore examined the effect of pertussis toxin and cholera toxin on fMLP-induced NF-κB activation and RhoA GTPase. Monocytes were pretreated with pertussis and cholera toxins separately, then stimulated with fMLP. Pertussis toxin (0.5 µg/ml) markedly reduced fMLP-stimulated NF-κB activation (Fig. 3A, lane 5), while cholera toxin had no such inhibitory effect in monocytes (Fig.3A, lane 8). Neither of the toxins inhibited TNFα-induced NF-κB activation in the same cells (Fig.3A, lanes 6 and 9). fMLP-induced RhoA activity was also blocked by pertussis toxin (Fig. 3B,lane 5) but not cholera toxin (Fig. 3B,lane 7), while neither toxin inhibited TNFα-induced RhoA activity (Fig. 3B, lanes 6 and 8). Thus, our results indicate that fMLP stimulates both RhoA and NF-κB activation through fMLP receptors that are coupled to pertussis toxin-sensitive heterotrimeric G proteins. Further demonstration of the necessity for RhoA activity in fMLP-induced NF-κB activation was obtained by overexpressing a dominant negative form of RhoA (RhoA-T19N). THP1 cells were cotransfected with an expression vector encoding a dominant negative form of RhoA (RhoA-T19N) together with an IκB promoter-CAT reporter plasmid prior to fMLP stimulation. Fig.4shows the effect of the dominant negative RhoA mutant protein on fMLP-stimulated CAT activity in THP1 cells transfected with the chimeric IκB-CAT plasmid. fMLP stimulated increased CAT activity in THP1 cells transfected with the WT-IκB-CAT plasmid (Fig. 4A, lane 2). Cotransfection of the dominant negative RhoA plasmid (2 µg) with the WT-IκB-CAT plasmid completely blocked fMLP-stimulated CAT activity (Fig. 4A,lane 4). These results confirm that RhoA activity is required for fMLP-induced NF-κB activation. The relationship between RhoA activity and subsequent NF-κB activation was further explored using RhoA-Q63L, a constitutively active form of RhoA. Transfection of THP1 cells with RhoA-Q63L resulted in increased CAT activity when the cells were cotransfected with a WT-IκB-CAT reporter plasmid containing a functional κB site (Fig.4B, lane 2). Thus, we have shown that RhoA activity alone is sufficient to induce NF-κB activity. Taken together with the previous results, this strongly suggests that fMLP-mediated NF-κB activation results at least in part from RhoA activity. We have previously demonstrated that fMLP stimulated PI3K activity, and this activity is required for fMLP-induced NF-κB activity in human monocytes (13Pan Z.K. Chen L.-Y. Cochrane C.G. Zuraw B.L. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 404-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Based on our current results and our previous report, the relationship between PI3K activation and activation of the RhoA appears to be an important issue. To investigate the role of PI3K in RhoA activity induced by fMLP, we used wortmannin and LY294002, that specifically inhibit PI3K by distinct mechanisms. As shown in Fig. 5, fMLP-induced RhoA activation was dose-dependently inhibited by wortmannin and LY294002, indicating that PI3K activity is required for the Gi-mediated activation of RhoA. Although the activation of NF-κB has been extensively studied in cultured cell lines of hematopoietic lineage, the signal transduction pathways for this activation process are still incompletely understood. The Rho GTPases are known to regulate actin cytoskeletons, focal adhesion complex formation, cell aggregation, and cell motility (14Tominaga T. Sugie K. Hirata M. Morii N. Fukata J. Uchida A.

To explore the mechanism by which fMLP promotes inflammatory disorders, we examined the ability of fMLP to regulate gene transcription and the signal transduction pathways that lead to NF-κB activation in human peripheral blood monocytes. We demonstrated that fMLP induced a time-dependent increase in RhoA activity, suggesting that RhoA plays a role in downstream signaling. These results were supported by the ability of C3 transferase, an inhibitor of Rho, to abolish fMLP-induced NF-κB activation. The role of Rho in fMLP-induced NF-κB activation was then confirmed by cotransfecting THP1 cells with a dominant negative RhoA plasmid as well as the chimeric IκB-CAT reporter plasmid. The dominant negative RhoA plasmid significantly abrogated the fMLP-stimulated CAT activity. These results suggest that fMLP-induced NF-κB activation requires activation of RhoA. The relationship between RhoA activity and subsequent NF-κB activation was further explored using a constitutively active form of RhoA (RhoA-Q63L), which increased NF-κB activity in the absence of additional stimulation. Taken together with the previous results, these data suggest that fMLP-induced NF-κB activation results from RhoA activity. The FPR is a member of the G protein-coupled receptor family (1Boulay F. Tardif M. Brouchon L. Vignais P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 168: 1103-1109Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 2Boulay F. Tardif M. Brouchon L. Vignais P. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 11123-11133Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). This class of receptors is typified by the presence of seven membrane-spanning domains. The G protein known to play a major role in FPR signal transduction is a pertussis toxin substrate, since treatment of neutrophils with the pertussis toxin blocks the majority of FPR-mediated responses (29Snyderman R. Smith C.D. Verghese M.W. J. Leukoc. Biol. 1986; 40: 785-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 30Bommakanti R.K. Bokoch G.M. Tolley J.O. Schreiber R.E. Siemsen D.W. Klotz K.N. Jesaitis A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7576-7581Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To assess the type of heterotrimeric G protein coupling the FPR to RhoA and NF-κB, we analyzed the effects of pertussis and cholera toxins. Pertussis toxin ADP-ribosylates Gαi and Gαo proteins, while cholera toxin ADP-ribosylates Gαs proteins (31Burnette W.N. Structure (Lond.). 1994; 2: 151-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). fMLP-stimulated RhoA activity and NF-κB activation were both inhibited by pertussis toxin but not by cholera toxin, indicating that both responses are transduced through Gαi or Gαo class of heterotrimeric G proteins. The mechanism for the potentiation of fMLP-induced RhoA activity by cholera toxin is currently unknown. It is possible that Gs and adenylyl cyclase might also function in the signaling mechanism governing RhoA activity in these system, but this will require further investigation. We previously demonstrated that fMLP-induced NF-κB activation required PI3K activity in human monocytes (13Pan Z.K. Chen L.-Y. Cochrane C.G. Zuraw B.L. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 404-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), and here we present evidence that RhoA activity is essential for fMLP-induced NF-κB activation. To test the possibility that PI3K is a component of the fMLP-stimulated signaling pathway leading to RhoA activation, we assessed the effect of inhibiting PI3K activity on subsequent fMLP-induced RhoA activation. Wortmannin and LY294002 have been shown to be specific PI3K inhibitors. Wortmannin irreversibly inactivates PI3K by binding to its p110 catalytic subunit (32Nakanishi S. Yano H. Matsuda Y. Cell. Signal. 1995; 7: 545-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar); LY294002 is a competitive inhibitor, binding to the ATP-binding site of the PI3K (33Vlahos C.J. Matter W.F. Hui K.Y. Brown R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5241-5248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Preincubation of human monocytes with either wortmannin or LY294002 significantly abrogated fMLP- induced RhoA activity. Our results indicate that PI3K likely functions upstream of RhoA in the fMLP-induced signaling pathway. The mechanisms linking PI3K activation to RhoA activity are unknown. D3-phosphorylated phosphatidylinositols are known to play important roles in cell growth and survival, although the exact role and immediate downstream molecular targets of PtdIns(3)P, PtdIns(3,4)P2, and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 are only now emerging (34Toker A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 254-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 35Duronio V. Scheid M.P. Ettinger S. Cell. Signal. 1998; 10: 233-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Several studies have demonstrated that PI3K may be activated downstream of the small Rho GTPases (36Keely P.J. Westwick J.K. Whitehead I.P. Der C.J. Parise L.V. Nature. 1997; 390: 632-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar, 37Ren X.D. Schwartz M.A. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 63-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 38Gomez J.

GTP-loaded Rac was shown to directly bind PI3K (39Bokoch G.M. Vlahos C.J. Wang Y. Knaus U.G. Traynor-Kaplan A.E. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 775-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Furthermore, inactivation of Rho using bacterial toxin C3 inhibited lysophosphatidic acid-induced PI3K activation in Swiss 3T3 cells (40Kumagai N. Morii N. Fujisawa K. Nemoto Y. Narumiya S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24535-24538Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A more recent study suggests that Toll-like receptor-2-mediated NF-κB activation requires Rac1 and PI3K is involved as a downstream effector (41Arbibe L. Mira J.-P. Teusch N. Kline L. Guha M. Mackman N. Godowski P.J. Ulevitch R.J. Knaus U.G. Nat. Immunol. 2000; 1: 533-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar). Other studies, however, have suggested that PI3K may activate the small Rho GTPases. Expression of a constitutively active PI3K mutant in Swiss 3T3 cells induced a subset of Rac- and Rho-mediated cellular responses (42Reif K. Nobes C.D. Thomas G. Hall A. Cantrell D.A. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1445-1455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The PI3K product PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 has been shown to bind the pleckstrin homology domain of guanine nucleotide exchange factors, providing a potential mechanism for PI3K-mediated regulation of Rho activation (42Reif K. Nobes C.D. Thomas G. Hall A. Cantrell D.A. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1445-1455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 43Han J. Luby-Phelps K. Das B. Shu X. Xia Y. Mosteller R.D. Krishna U.M. Falck J.R. White M.A. Broek D. Science. 1998; 279: 558-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). Additionally, the p85 regulatory subunit of PI3K contains a breakpoint cluster region-homology domain (BH) that has been shown to have GTPase-activating protein activity (22Musacchio A. Cantley L.C. Harrison S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14373-14378Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In summary, we have shown that fMLP rapidly activates the RhoA GTPase in human peripheral blood monocytes. fMLP-stimulated RhoA activity and NF-κB activation were both inhibited by pertussis toxin but not cholera toxin, suggesting that both FPR-mediated responses are the results of coupling to the Gi/Go class of Gα proteins. Utilizing both a specific inhibitor and transient expression of a dominant negative RhoA mutant, we further showed that fMLP-induced NF-κB activation required RhoA activity. We have previously reported that RhoA is also involved in NF-κB activation through the Gq-coupled B2 bradykinin receptor (21Pan Z.K. Ye R.D. Christiansen S.C. Jagels M.K. Bokoch G.M. Zuraw B.L. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 3038-3045PubMed Google Scholar), but it was not clear at that time whether bradykinin stimulation could activate RhoA in fibroblasts. Although the mechanism by which Gq and Gi activates RhoA may not be the same, these findings combined suggest that the signaling pathways initiated by Gi and Gq may converge at a point prior to RhoA activation. Although TNFα also stimulated RhoA activity, TNFα-stimulated NF-κB activation was not affected by inhibition of RhoA activity. These findings provide evidence that fMLP-induced NF-κB activation utilizes a signaling pathway that requires both PI3K and low molecular weight GTPase RhoA and is distinct from the signaling pathway utilized by TNFα. The signaling molecules linking FPR-associated Gi/Go proteins and the PI3K, small GTPase RhoA, however, remain to be determined. We thank Drs. G. M. Bokoch, M. A. Schwartz, and P. J. Chiao for providing DNA constructs."

Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 230-262Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, how changes in external osmolality are detected is still under investigation. We follow this question by studying the stimulus for EnvZ, a postulated osmosensor of E. coli. The membrane-bound histidine kinase EnvZ modulates in interplay with the soluble response regulator OmpR expression of ompC and ompF, encoding porins of the outer membrane. OmpF and OmpC differ in their pore diameter, which is 1.16 nm in the case of OmpF and 1.08 nm in the case of OmpC, leading to a diffusion rate 10 times higher for OmpF compared with OmpC (2Nikaido H. Vaara M. Microbiol. Rev. 1985; 49: 1-32Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Csonka L.N. Microbiol. Rev. 1989; 53: 121-147Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although the sum of OmpF and OmpC remains constant, the relative levels change in a reciprocal manner depending on the osmolality of the medium, whereby low osmolality favors the synthesis of OmpF, and high osmolality leads to preferential synthesis of OmpC (4Pratt L.A. Silhavy T.J. Hoch J.A. Silhavy T.J. Two-component Signal Transduction. ASM Press, Washington, D.C.1995: 105-127Google Scholar).EnvZ is autophosphorylated by the use of ATP at a highly conserved His residue (His-243), and subsequently, the phosphoryl group is transferred to a highly conserved Asp residue of the response regulator OmpR (Asp-55). EnvZ also has phosphatase activity to dephosphorylate OmpR∼P (see Ref. 5Egger L.A. Park H. Inouye M. Genes Cells. 1997; 2: 167-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar for review). Phosphorylated OmpR is a transcriptional factor that binds upstream of the promoter regions ofompC and ompF to modulate their expression (6Forst S.A. Delgado J. Inouye M. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 2949-2955Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Head C.G. Tardy A. Kenney L.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 281: 857-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 8Harlocker S.L. Bergstrom L. Inouye M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26849-26856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). In vitro, the equilibrium between phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated OmpR is drastically shifted toward the phosphorylated form in the presence of DNA fragments comprising OmpR binding sites (9Qin L. Yoshida T. Inouye M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 908-913PubMed Google Scholar,10Ames S.K. Frankema N. Kenney L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11792-11797Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar).EnvZ is localized in the inner membrane. Based on sequence analysis and β-lactamase hybrid proteins, it consists of a N-terminal cytoplasmic tail (residues 1–15), two membrane-spanning domains (residues 16–47 and 163–179), a periplasmic domain (residues 48–162), and a cytoplasmic C-terminal domain (11Forst S. Comeau D. Norioka S. Inouye M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16433-16438Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Structural data are available for the C-terminal domain of EnvZ. The catalytic ATP-binding domain (residues 290–450) forms an α/β-sandwich fold (12Tanaka T. Saha S.K. Tomomori C. Ishima R. Liu D. Tong K.I. Park H. Dutta R. Qin L. Swindells M.B. Yamazaki T. Ono A.M. Kainosho M. Inouye M. Ikura M. Nature. 1998; 396: 88-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), and the dimerization histidine phosphotransfer domain (residues 223–289) comprises a four-helix bundle formed by two identical helix-turn-helix subunits (13Tomomori C. Tanaka T. Dutta R. Park H. Saha S.K. Zhu Y. Ishima R. Liu D. Tong K.I. Kurokawa H. Qian H. Inouye M. Ikura M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 729-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar).Mutational analyses of EnvZ have identified amino acid regions that are critical for signaling. The most critical domains are centered in the linker region, the region between the second transmembrane and the cytoplasmic transmitter domain (14Park H. Inouye M. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 4382-4390Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and around the site of autophosphorylation including the X-region (15Hsing W. Russo F.D. Bernd K.K. Silhavy T.J. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 4538-4546Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Periplasmic deletions result in a constitutive OmpF− OmpC+ phenotype (16Igo M.M. Silhavy T.J. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 5971-5973Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) or have no effect at all (17Leonardo M.R. Forst S. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 22: 405-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). A truncation of 38 amino acids prevents proper localization of EnvZ into the cytoplasmic membrane; the protein can be phosphorylated, but the response to osmolality is lost (16Igo M.M. Silhavy T.J. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 5971-5973Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), indicating the necessity of membrane binding. Amino acid replacements in the transmembrane domains result in various phenotypes (15Hsing W. Russo F.D. Bernd K.K. Silhavy T.J. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 4538-4546Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Waukau J. Forst S. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 5534-5538Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Amino acid replacements of the conserved asparagine residue Asn-347 lead to an OmpF+ OmpC− phenotype probably as a result of the shift in the enzymatic activities of EnvZ (19Dutta R. Inouye M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1424-1429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Thr-237 plays a critical role for EnvZ phosphatase activity (20Dutta R. Yoshida T. Inouye M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38645-38653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). A number of kinase− phosphatase+ or kinase+ phosphatase− mutants were identified; most of them are EnvZ derivatives with amino acid replacements in a structural motif, called the X-region, following His-234 (15Hsing W. Russo F.D. Bernd K.K. Silhavy T.J. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 4538-4546Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).The primary signal to which EnvZ responds is still unclear. In contrast to other sensor processes where ligand binding is involved (e.g. nitrate binds to the sensor kinase NarX (21Lee A.I. Delgado A. Gunsalus R.P. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 5309-5316Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and citrate binds to the sensor kinase CitA (22Kaspar S. Perozzo R. Reinelt S. Meyer M. Pfister K. Scapozza L. Bott M. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 33: 858-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar)), sensing of changes in osmolality is difficult to attribute to a specific ligand. Because EnvZ responds both to polar and nonpolar solutes, it is proposed that EnvZ is activated by changes in the cytoplasmic, periplasmic, or extracellular water activity (aW) (23Csonka L.N. Hanson A.D. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1991; 45: 569-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar). However, the picture is even more complex. It is known that glycine betaine antagonizes the osmotic repression of ompF (24Barron A. May G. Bremer E. Villarejo M. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 167: 433-438Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and that procaine represses ompF and induces ompC at low osmolality (25Tokishita S. Yamada H. Aiba H. Mizuno T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1990; 108: 488-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 26Jung K. Krabusch M. Altendorf K. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 3800-3803Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar).Most of the in vitro analyses for EnvZ were done with a soluble truncated form (EnvZc), because of the lack of a method for solubilization and reconstitution of EnvZ. Here we describe the influence of various solutes on the activities of purified and reconstituted full-length EnvZ. The results obtained with two differentin vitro test systems reveal a stimulation of the autokinase activity of EnvZ by monovalent cations, especially K+.DISCUSSIONHere we described a procedure for the purification and reconstitution of full-length EnvZ. All known activities were detectable for the purified and reconstituted EnvZ under standard phosphorylation conditions, although rates were different compared with a truncated EnvZ (EnvZc). In case of full-length EnvZ, transfer of the phosphoryl group to OmpR was slow and not completed within 5 min. Earlier, similar results were obtained with EnvZ enriched in membrane vesicles (15Hsing W. Russo F.D. Bernd K.K. Silhavy T.J. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 4538-4546Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For EnvZc a very rapid transfer of the phosphoryl group was shown (9Qin L. Yoshida T. Inouye M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 908-913PubMed Google Scholar). EnvZ-mediated OmpR∼P dephosphorylation was also slower compared with the results described for EnvZc (9Qin L. Yoshida T. Inouye M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 908-913PubMed Google Scholar). These examples illustrate that interactions of the domains of the sensor kinase probably fine tune the enzymatic activities. This is in accord with the findings of Inouye and co-workers in regard to the importance of an interaction between domains A and B for the phosphatase activity (43Zhu Y. Qin L. Yoshida T. Inouye M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7808-7813Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar).The availability of purified components allowed the reconstruction of the whole signal transduction cascade in vitro. As shown before (9Qin L. Yoshida T. Inouye M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 908-913PubMed Google Scholar), the amount of phosphorylated OmpR was drastically increased in the presence of DNA fragments comprising the OmpR-binding site. Our studies have shown that the addition of increasing concentrations of KCl raised tremendously the initial rate of OmpR phosphorylation as well as the steady state accumulation of OmpR∼P. An activation of the signal transduction cascade, as detected by the increased accumulation of OmpR∼P, was also achieved in the presence of other monovalent cations such as Rb+, Na+, or NH 4+, although to a lower extent compared with KCl. Because increasing concentrations of a Tris/MES buffer did not stimulate the signal transduction cascade, it is unlikely that changes of the ionic strength influence EnvZ activity. The data also imply that the stimulation is not due to an increase of the osmolality, because sucrose or trehalose did not show any effect. Osmotic upshifted cells are able to take up substantial amounts of proline or glycine betaine, but none of these compounds exhibited a stimulatory effect on EnvZ autokinase activity. Recently, it was shown that chloride ions are important for the osmoregulation of the halophilic bacterium Halobacillus halophilus (44Roessler M. Muller V. FEBS Lett. 2001; 489: 125-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). To ascertain that the determined effects are due to the cation and not to the anion, we tested the influence of different salts. We found that the presence of KNO3, K2SO4, or KBr had the same stimulatory effects as KCl. Thus, K+ and related monovalent ions specifically enhance the production of OmpR∼P. Earlier, Mizuno and co-workers (25Tokishita S. Yamada H. Aiba H. Mizuno T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1990; 108: 488-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) characterized EnvZ in membrane vesicles, and they found also an increased accumulation of phosphorylated OmpR depending on an increase of K+, Na+, or Li+. They attributed this effect to a decrease of the EnvZ phosphatase activity; however, they did not measure phosphatase activity directly. Our studies of the single enzymatic activities of EnvZ revealed that K+ and other monovalent cations specifically stimulate the autokinase activity, whereas the rates of phosphotransfer and phosphatase activities of EnvZ are unchanged. Therefore, we conclude that accumulation of OmpR∼P in the presence of K+ is due to an increased autokinase activity of EnvZ.The K+-specific effect on EnvZ autokinase activity was confirmed when we used another in vitro test system, which is based on RSO-MV. When the K+ concentration in the lumen was increased, autokinase activity of EnvZ was stimulated. This effect was not observed in the presence of NaCl or when outside of the vesicles the concentration of KCl, NaCl, sucrose, glucose, or sorbitol was increased. Thus, domains of EnvZ exposed to the luminal side, which are the cytoplasmic domains, are sensitive toward K+.It is known that expression of both ompF and ompCrequires phosphorylated OmpR; preferential expression of one of these genes depends on the amount of phosphorylated OmpR (4Pratt L.A. Silhavy T.J. Hoch J.A. Silhavy T.J. Two-component Signal Transduction. ASM Press, Washington, D.C.1995: 105-127Google Scholar). Here we demonstrated that the amount of OmpR∼P is substantially increased by stimulating the autokinase activity of EnvZ with increasing concentrations of K+ ions. Uptake of K+ appears to be the earliest response of E. coli after an osmotic upshift (45Rhoads D.B. Epstein W. J. Gen. Physiol. 1978; 72: 283-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is suggested that the increased K+ concentration in osmotic stressed cells raises the autokinase activity of EnvZ, thereby increasing the amount of OmpR∼P and leading to ompC expression. Earlier, Epstein and co-workers (46McLaggan D. Naprstek J. Buurman E.T. Epstein W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1911-1917Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) had shown the interdependence of K+ and glutamate accumulation in cells exposed to an osmotic upshift. In accord with a stimulation of EnvZ autokinase activity by K+is the finding that ompC is not induced when the osmotic upshift is done in the presence of betaine, a condition that reduces the rate and the extent of K+ accumulation (24Barron A. May G. Bremer E. Villarejo M. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 167: 433-438Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Regulation of one of the enzymatic activities of EnvZ is in agreement with the numerous EnvZ derivatives with altered enzymatic properties that lead to altered ompF/ompC expression patterns. Furthermore, the sensitivity of the cytoplasmic domains toward K+ fits well with EnvZ mutants with altered sensing properties, which have single amino acid replacements within the linker or the X domain, which are both cytoplasmic (14Park H. Inouye M. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 4382-4390Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Hsing W. Russo F.D. Bernd K.K. Silhavy T.J. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 4538-4546Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Despite these agreements, the correlation between the accumulation of K+and the stimulation of EnvZ autokinase in vivo still has to be shown. In addition, in vitro studies indicated that maximal amounts of phosphorylated OmpR were already detected at physiological K+ concentrations. Therefore, an increase of the intracellular K+ concentration seems to be one primary stimulus perceived by EnvZ but not the only one. Integration host factor and DNA bending have already been shown to be involved in the transcriptional regulation of ompF (47Slauch J.M. Silhavy T.J. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 4039-4048Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 48Slauch J.M. Russo F.D. Silhavy T.J. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 7501-7510Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 49Huang K.J. Schieberl J.L. Igo M.M. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 1309-1315Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).The obtained results are clearly distinct from the activation mechanism of the osmosensor and transporter ProP of E. coli. Transport activity of purified ProP in proteoliposomes (50Racher K.I. Voegele R.T. Marshall E.V. Culham D.E. Wood J.M. Jung H. Bacon M. Cairns M.T. Ferguson S.M. Liang W.J. Henderson P.J. White G. Hallett F.R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1676-1684Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) or RSO-MV (42Milner J.L. Grothe S. Wood J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 14900-14905Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was significantly increased upon an osmotic upshift imposed by NaCl or sucrose. In addition, the results obtained for EnvZ are different to KdpD, a sensor kinase, which responds to K+ limitation or an osmotic upshift imposed by salts. In the RSO-MV test system, KdpD autokinase activity was activated by an increase of the NaCl concentration and inhibited by K+ ions in the lumen of the vesicles (37Jung K. Veen M. Altendorf K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40142-40147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). When the salt concentration outside of the vesicles was raised, a small but significant stimulation of autokinase activity of KdpD was observed, whereas no effects were seen for EnvZ under these conditions.In summary, EnvZ catalyzes several reactions: its autophosphorylation, the transfer of the phosphoryl group to OmpR, and the dephosphorylation of OmpR∼P. Our results reveal that the autokinase activity of EnvZ is stimulated by monovalent cations, specifically K+ ions. The logical consequence of these results is the search for EnvZ mutants that lost the sensitivity toward K+. The adaptation of Escherichia coli to varying osmolalities is studied thoroughly (1Wood J.M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 230-262Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, how changes in external osmolality are detected is still under investigation. We follow this question by studying the stimulus for EnvZ, a postulated osmosensor of E. coli. The membrane-bound histidine kinase EnvZ modulates in interplay with the soluble response regulator OmpR expression of ompC and ompF, encoding porins of the outer membrane. OmpF and OmpC differ in their pore diameter, which is 1.16 nm in the case of OmpF and 1.08 nm in the case of OmpC, leading to a diffusion rate 10 times higher for OmpF compared with OmpC (2Nikaido H. Vaara M. Microbiol. Rev. 1985; 49: 1-32Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Csonka L.N. Microbiol. Rev. 1989; 53: 121-147Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although the sum of OmpF and OmpC remains constant, the relative levels change in a reciprocal manner depending on the osmolality of the medium, whereby low osmolality favors the synthesis of OmpF, and high osmolality leads to preferential synthesis of OmpC (4Pratt L.A. Silhavy T.J. Hoch J.A. Silhavy T.J. Two-component Signal Transduction. ASM Press, Washington, D.C.1995: 105-127Google Scholar). EnvZ is autophosphorylated by the use of ATP at a highly conserved His residue (His-243), and subsequently, the phosphoryl group is transferred to a highly conserved Asp residue of the response regulator OmpR (Asp-55). EnvZ also has phosphatase activity to dephosphorylate OmpR∼P (see Ref. 5Egger L.A. Park H. Inouye M. Genes Cells. 1997; 2: 167-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar for review). Phosphorylated OmpR is a transcriptional factor that binds upstream of the promoter regions ofompC and ompF to modulate their expression (6Forst S.A. Delgado J. Inouye M. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 2949-2955Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Head C.G. Tardy A. Kenney L.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 281: 857-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 8Harlocker S.L. Bergstrom L. Inouye M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26849-26856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). In vitro, the equilibrium between phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated OmpR is drastically shifted toward the phosphorylated form in the presence of DNA fragments comprising OmpR binding sites (9Qin L. Yoshida T. Inouye M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 908-913PubMed Google Scholar,10Ames S.K. Frankema N. Kenney L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11792-11797Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). EnvZ is localized in the inner membrane. Based on sequence analysis and β-lactamase hybrid proteins, it consists of a N-terminal cytoplasmic tail (residues 1–15), two membrane-spanning domains (residues 16–47 and 163–179), a periplasmic domain (residues 48–162), and a cytoplasmic C-terminal domain (11Forst S. Comeau D. Norioka S. Inouye M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16433-16438Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Structural data are available for the C-terminal domain of EnvZ. The catalytic ATP-binding domain (residues 290–450) forms an α/β-sandwich fold (12Tanaka T. Saha S.K. Tomomori C. Ishima R. Liu D. Tong K.I. Park H. Dutta R. Qin L. Swindells M.B. Yamazaki T. Ono A.M. Kainosho M. Inouye M. Ikura M. Nature. 1998; 396: 88-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), and the dimerization histidine phosphotransfer domain (residues 223–289) comprises a four-helix bundle formed by two identical helix-turn-helix subunits (13Tomomori C. Tanaka T. Dutta R. Park H. Saha S.K. Zhu Y. Ishima R. Liu D. Tong K.I. Kurokawa H. Qian H. Inouye M. Ikura M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 729-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Mutational analyses of EnvZ have identified amino acid regions that are critical for signaling. The most critical domains are centered in the linker region, the region between the second transmembrane and the cytoplasmic transmitter domain (14Park H. Inouye M. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 4382-4390Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and around the site of autophosphorylation including the X-region (15Hsing W. Russo F.D. Bernd K.K. Silhavy T.J. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 4538-4546Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Periplasmic deletions result in a constitutive OmpF− OmpC+ phenotype (16Igo M.M. Silhavy T.J. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 5971-5973Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) or have no effect at all (17Leonardo M.R. Forst S. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 22: 405-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). A truncation of 38 amino acids prevents proper localization of EnvZ into the cytoplasmic membrane; the protein can be phosphorylated, but the response to osmolality is lost (16Igo M.M. Silhavy T.J. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 5971-5973Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), indicating the necessity of membrane binding. Amino acid replacements in the transmembrane domains result in various phenotypes (15Hsing W. Russo F.D. Bernd K.K. Silhavy T.J. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 4538-4546Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Waukau J. Forst S. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 5534-5538Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Amino acid replacements of the conserved asparagine residue Asn-347 lead to an OmpF+ OmpC− phenotype probably as a result of the shift in the enzymatic activities of EnvZ (19Dutta R. Inouye M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1424-1429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Thr-237 plays a critical role for EnvZ phosphatase activity (20Dutta R. Yoshida T. Inouye M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38645-38653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). A number of kinase− phosphatase+ or kinase+ phosphatase− mutants were identified; most of them are EnvZ derivatives with amino acid replacements in a structural motif, called the X-region, following His-234 (15Hsing W. Russo F.D. Bernd K.K. Silhavy T.J. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 4538-4546Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The primary signal to which EnvZ responds is still unclear. In contrast to other sensor processes where ligand binding is involved (e.g. nitrate binds to the sensor kinase NarX (21Lee A.I. Delgado A. Gunsalus R.P. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 5309-5316Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and citrate binds to the sensor kinase CitA (22Kaspar S. Perozzo R. Reinelt S. Meyer M. Pfister K. Scapozza L. Bott M. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 33: 858-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar)), sensing of changes in osmolality is difficult to attribute to a specific ligand. Because EnvZ responds both to polar and nonpolar solutes, it is proposed that EnvZ is activated by changes in the cytoplasmic, periplasmic, or extracellular water activity (aW) (23Csonka L.N. Hanson A.D. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1991; 45: 569-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar). However, the picture is even more complex. It is known that glycine betaine antagonizes the osmotic repression of ompF (24Barron A. May G. Bremer E. Villarejo M. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 167: 433-438Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and that procaine represses ompF and induces ompC at low osmolality (25Tokishita S. Yamada H. Aiba H. Mizuno T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1990; 108: 488-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 26Jung K. Krabusch M. Altendorf K. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 3800-3803Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Most of the in vitro analyses for EnvZ were done with a soluble truncated form (EnvZc), because of the lack of a method for solubilization and reconstitution of EnvZ. Here we describe the influence of various solutes on the activities of purified and reconstituted full-length EnvZ. The results obtained with two differentin vitro test systems reveal a stimulation of the autokinase activity of EnvZ by monovalent cations, especially K+. DISCUSSIONHere we described a procedure for the purification and reconstitution of full-length EnvZ. All known activities were detectable for the purified and reconstituted EnvZ under standard phosphorylation conditions, although rates were different compared with a truncated EnvZ (EnvZc). In case of full-length EnvZ, transfer of the phosphoryl group to OmpR was slow and not completed within 5 min. Earlier, similar results were obtained with EnvZ enriched in membrane vesicles (15Hsing W. Russo F.D. Bernd K.K. Silhavy T.J. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 4538-4546Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For EnvZc a very rapid transfer of the phosphoryl group was shown (9Qin L. Yoshida T. Inouye M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 908-913PubMed Google Scholar). EnvZ-mediated OmpR∼P dephosphorylation was also slower compared with the results described for EnvZc (9Qin L. Yoshida T. Inouye M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 908-913PubMed Google Scholar). These examples illustrate that interactions of the domains of the sensor kinase probably fine tune the enzymatic activities. This is in accord with the findings of Inouye and co-workers in regard to the importance of an interaction between domains A and B for the phosphatase activity (43Zhu Y. Qin L. Yoshida T. Inouye M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7808-7813Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar).The availability of purified components allowed the reconstruction of the whole signal transduction cascade in vitro. As shown before (9Qin L. Yoshida T. Inouye M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 908-913PubMed Google Scholar), the amount of phosphorylated OmpR was drastically increased in the presence of DNA fragments comprising the OmpR-binding site. Our studies have shown that the addition of increasing concentrations of KCl raised tremendously the initial rate of OmpR phosphorylation as well as the steady state accumulation of OmpR∼P. An activation of the signal transduction cascade, as detected by the increased accumulation of OmpR∼P, was also achieved in the presence of other monovalent cations such as Rb+, Na+, or NH 4+, although to a lower extent compared with KCl. Because increasing concentrations of a Tris/MES buffer did not stimulate the signal transduction cascade, it is unlikely that changes of the ionic strength influence EnvZ activity. The data also imply that the stimulation is not due to an increase of the osmolality, because sucrose or trehalose did not show any effect. Osmotic upshifted cells are able to take up substantial amounts of proline or glycine betaine, but none of these compounds exhibited a stimulatory effect on EnvZ autokinase activity. Recently, it was shown that chloride ions are important for the osmoregulation of the halophilic bacterium Halobacillus halophilus (44Roessler M. Muller V. FEBS Lett. 2001; 489: 125-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). To ascertain that the determined effects are due to the cation and not to the anion, we tested the influence of different salts. We found that the presence of KNO3, K2SO4, or KBr had the same stimulatory effects as KCl. Thus, K+ and related monovalent ions specifically enhance the production of OmpR∼P. Earlier, Mizuno and co-workers (25Tokishita S. Yamada H. Aiba H. Mizuno T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1990; 108: 488-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) characterized EnvZ in membrane vesicles, and they found also an increased accumulation of phosphorylated OmpR depending on an increase of K+, Na+, or Li+. They attributed this effect to a decrease of the EnvZ phosphatase activity; however, they did not measure phosphatase activity directly. Our studies of the single enzymatic activities of EnvZ revealed that K+ and other monovalent cations specifically stimulate the autokinase activity, whereas the rates of phosphotransfer and phosphatase activities of EnvZ are unchanged. Therefore, we conclude that accumulation of OmpR∼P in the presence of K+ is due to an increased autokinase activity of EnvZ.The K+-specific effect on EnvZ autokinase activity was confirmed when we used another in vitro test system, which is based on RSO-MV. When the K+ concentration in the lumen was increased, autokinase activity of EnvZ was stimulated. This effect was not observed in the presence of NaCl or when outside of the vesicles the concentration of KCl, NaCl, sucrose, glucose, or sorbitol was increased. Thus, domains of EnvZ exposed to the luminal side, which are the cytoplasmic domains, are sensitive toward K+.It is known that expression of both ompF and ompCrequires phosphorylated OmpR; preferential expression of one of these genes depends on the amount of phosphorylated OmpR (4Pratt L.A. Silhavy T.J. Hoch J.A. Silhavy T.J. Two-component Signal Transduction. ASM Press, Washington, D.C.1995: 105-127Google Scholar). Here we demonstrated that the amount of OmpR∼P is substantially increased by stimulating the autokinase activity of EnvZ with increasing concentrations of K+ ions. Uptake of K+ appears to be the earliest response of E. coli after an osmotic upshift (45Rhoads D.B. Epstein W. J. Gen. Physiol. 1978; 72: 283-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is suggested that the increased K+ concentration in osmotic stressed cells raises the autokinase activity of EnvZ, thereby increasing the amount of OmpR∼P and leading to ompC expression. Earlier, Epstein and co-workers (46McLaggan D. Naprstek J. Buurman E.T. Epstein W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1911-1917Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) had shown the interdependence of K+ and glutamate accumulation in cells exposed to an osmotic upshift. In accord with a stimulation of EnvZ autokinase activity by K+is the finding that ompC is not induced when the osmotic upshift is done in the presence of betaine, a condition that reduces the rate and the extent of K+ accumulation (24Barron A. May G. Bremer E. Villarejo M. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 167: 433-438Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Regulation of one of the enzymatic activities of EnvZ is in agreement with the numerous EnvZ derivatives with altered enzymatic properties that lead to altered ompF/ompC expression patterns. Furthermore, the sensitivity of the cytoplasmic domains toward K+ fits well with EnvZ mutants with altered sensing properties, which have single amino acid replacements within the linker or the X domain, which are both cytoplasmic (14Park H.

Despite these agreements, the correlation between the accumulation of K+and the stimulation of EnvZ autokinase in vivo still has to be shown. In addition, in vitro studies indicated that maximal amounts of phosphorylated OmpR were already detected at physiological K+ concentrations. Therefore, an increase of the intracellular K+ concentration seems to be one primary stimulus perceived by EnvZ but not the only one. Integration host factor and DNA bending have already been shown to be involved in the transcriptional regulation of ompF (47Slauch J.M. Silhavy T.J. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 4039-4048Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 48Slauch J.M. Russo F.D. Silhavy T.J. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 7501-7510Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 49Huang K.J. Schieberl J.L.

Chem. 1988; 263: 14900-14905Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was significantly increased upon an osmotic upshift imposed by NaCl or sucrose.

In addition, the results obtained for EnvZ are different to KdpD, a sensor kinase, which responds to K+ limitation or an osmotic upshift imposed by salts. In the RSO-MV test system, KdpD autokinase activity was activated by an increase of the NaCl concentration and inhibited by K+ ions in the lumen of the vesicles (37Jung K. Veen M. Altendorf K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40142-40147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). When the salt concentration outside of the vesicles was raised, a small but significant stimulation of autokinase activity of KdpD was observed, whereas no effects were seen for EnvZ under these conditions. In summary, EnvZ catalyzes several reactions: its autophosphorylation, the transfer of the phosphoryl group to OmpR, and the dephosphorylation of OmpR∼P. Our results reveal that the autokinase activity of EnvZ is stimulated by monovalent cations, specifically K+ ions. The logical consequence of these results is the search for EnvZ mutants that lost the sensitivity toward K+. We thank Dr. T. J. Silhavy (Princeton University) for providing strains and plasmid pFR29."
https://openalex.org/W1994192600,"Myxococcus xanthus transcriptional factor CarD participates in carotenogenesis and fruiting body formation. It is the only reported prokaryotic protein having adjacent “AT-hook” DNA-binding and acidic regions characteristic of eukaryotic high mobility group A (HMGA) proteins. The latter are small, unstructured, nonhistone nuclear proteins that function as architectural factors to remodel DNA and chromatin structure and modulate various DNA binding activities. We find CarD to be predominantly dimeric with two stable domains: (a) an N-terminal domain of defined secondary and tertiary structure which is absent in eukaryotic HMGA proteins; (b) a C-terminal domain formed by the acidic and AT-hook segments and lacking defined structure. CarD, like HMGA proteins, binds specifically to the minor-groove of AT-rich DNA present in two appropriately spaced tracts. As in HMGA proteins, casein kinase II can phosphorylate the CarD acidic region, and this dramatically decreases the DNA binding affinity of CarD. The acidic region, in addition to modulating DNA binding, confers structural stability to CarD. We discuss how the structural and functional plasticity arising from domain organization in CarD could be linked to its role as a general transcriptional factor in M. xanthus.

Accordingly, HMGI is referred to as HMGA1a Transcription, replication, recombination, and repair are mediated by the assembly of specific nucleoprotein complexes. One essential consequence of this nucleoprotein complex formation is to confer local flexibility to the inherently stiff DNA molecule (1Shore D. Baldwin R.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 170: 957-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Various factors guide the specific assembly of these complexes including proteins referred to as architectural factors because they remodel DNA by specific or nonspecific DNA binding (2Werner M.H. Burley S.K. Cell. 1997; 88: 733-736Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Given their fundamental importance, architectural proteins are found in phages, prokaryotes, and eukaryotes. Examples in phages and bacteria include the proteins HU, H-NS, IHF, and phage ϕ29 p6 (see Ref. 3Elías-Arnanz M. Salas M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2502-2513Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar and references therein). In eukaryotes, in addition to histones, the abundant nonhistone chromosomal proteins of the HMG1 family constitute an important group of architectural transcription factors that regulate gene expression and are implicated in a variety of cellular functions (4Grosschedl R.K. Giese K. Pagel J. Trends Genet. 1994; 10: 94-100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (733) Google Scholar, 5Bustin M. Reeves R. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol.

The subfamily of HMGA proteins (previously HMGI(Y) (7Bustin M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 152-153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) is characterized by the presence of multiple repeats of a conserved RGRP sequence (the “AT-hook” motif) embedded in a less conserved cluster of basic and proline residues (8Aravind L. Landsman D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 4413-4421Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). The most extensively studied, the mammalian HMGA isoforms, are small proteins (≤107 residues; ∼12 kDa) with three AT-hooks lying between a highly acidic C-terminal stretch of about 15 residues and a short N-terminal region of less than 25 residues of variable sequence (Ref. 9Bustin M. Lehn D.A. Landsman D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1049: 231-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar; Fig.1 A). The AT-hooks bind specifically to the narrow minor groove of AT-rich sequences 4–8 base pairs in length occurring in at least two or three appropriately spaced tracts (10Solomon M.J. Strauss F. Varshavsky A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 1276-1280Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 11Maher J.F. Nathans D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6716-6720Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The unstructured AT-hooks adopt a defined conformation on binding DNA (12Huth J.R. Bewley C.A. Nissen M.S. Evans J.N.S. Reeves R. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 657-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar), and their DNA binding specificity is modulated by the acidic domain (13Yie J. Liang S. Merika M. Thanos D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3649-3662Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Protein conformational changes and decreases in DNA binding affinity are also brought about by phosphorylation by a number of kinases including CKII, Cdc2 kinase, mitogen-activated protein kinase, and protein kinase C (14Palvimo J.

This provokes fluctuations in intracellular protein stability and in DNA binding, thereby fine-tuning their regulatory functions in vivo (16Reeves R. Langan T.A. Nissen M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

The first and, to our knowledge, only prokaryotic protein with multiple AT-hooks and a flanking highly acidic region is the 316-amino acid (34 kDa) product of gene carD in the bacterium Myxococcus xanthus (19Nicolás F.J. Cayuela M.L. Martínez-Argudo I.M. Ruiz-Vázquez R.M. Murillo F.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6881-6885Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Protein CarD is involved in regulating at least two distinct processes in M. xanthus (20Nicolás F.J. Ruiz-Vázquez R.M. Murillo F.J. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2375-2387Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). It is required for the expression of two different sets of genes that form part of a complex network regulating light-induced carotenogenesis, “the light regulon” (reviewed in Ref. 21Hodgson D.A. Murillo F.J. Dworkin M. Kaiser D. Myxobacteria II. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1993: 157-181Google Scholar). In addition, CarD also participates in the starvation-induced formation of fruiting bodies where thousands of cells cluster and subsequently undergo cellular differentiation to myxospores (reviewed in Ref. 22Kaiser D. Losick R. Shapiro L. Microbial Development. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1984: 197-218Google Scholar). Mutations in carD prevent fruiting body formation and block the expression of several developmentally activated genes (20Nicolás F.J. Ruiz-Vázquez R.M. Murillo F.J. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2375-2387Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Thus CarD, like mammalian HMGA proteins, is recruited by distinct gene regulatory circuits in vivo. In contrast to mammalian HMGA proteins, CarD has one more AT-hook, and its significantly longer acidic region is situated to the N rather than to the C terminus of the AT-hook region (Fig. 1 B). Moreover, the segment containing the acidic and AT-hook portions of CarD is preceded by a considerably larger N-terminal stretch of around 180 amino acids, whose equivalent is absent in eukaryotic HMGA proteins. This N-terminal segment of unknown function includes in its sequence a stretch of heptad repeats of the type found in leucine zipper coiled-coils (19Nicolás F.J. Cayuela M.L. Martínez-Argudo I.M. Ruiz-Vázquez R.M. Murillo F.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6881-6885Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Several CKII phosphorylation sites are predicted in the acidic and N-terminal regions of CarD, as also some protein kinase C sites (Fig. 1). Equivalent kinases have not thus far been specifically assigned in M. xanthus, but it does contain several eukaryotic-like serine/threonine protein kinases (23Jain R. Inouye S. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 6544-6550Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and at least one functionally linked phosphatase which have been proposed to act in concert in the developmental cycle of the bacterium (24Treuner-Lange A. Ward M.J. Zusman D.R. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 40: 126-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The focus of the present study is to characterize the structural and functional domain organization in CarD. We have mapped out the domain architecture in CarD by means of biochemical and spectroscopic analyses of the pure protein and several specifically designed fragments, and have probed these for oligomerization, DNA binding, and phosphorylation. The properties thus dissected in CarD are discussed using the reported properties of the considerably smaller mammalian HMGA1a as a benchmark. Based on our findings we hypothesize on how the modular organization in CarD affords the structural stability and malleability that may underlie its regulatory roles in M. xanthus. Several constructs were generated for the production of CarD and the following truncated versions: CD-(1–104), CD-(183–316), CD-(225–316), CD-(247–316), CD-(Δ181–223), and CD-(1–215), the numbers referring to amino acid positions in CarD. The expression vector pET11b was used for production of untagged proteins and pET15b for production of His6-tagged ones (25Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (6003) Google Scholar). CarD and the indicated fragments, with the exception of CD-(1–215), were obtained by polymerase chain reaction amplification and cloned into the NdeI-BamHI sites of the vectors. The NdeI site introduces a non-native Met for bacterial expression of fragments CD-(183–316), CD-(225–316), and CD-(247–316). The procedure to obtain a construct expressing CD-(1–215) was as follows. pET11-carD was cut with BglII-BamHI, the fragment containing carD was digested with HinfI (which cuts at a position corresponding to the codons for residues 215 and 216), filled with Klenow and cut with NdeI. This fragment was cloned into pET11b, first cut with BamHI, filled with Klenow, then cut with NdeI. The resulting ligation results in a TGA stop codon immediately following the codon for CarD residue 215. pET11b-HMGA1a (human) was constructed from plasmid pET15b-HMGA1a (generously provided by Prof. T. Maniatis, Harvard University; Ref.26Thanos D. Maniatis T. Cell. 1992; 71: 777-789Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells freshly transformed with each construct were cultured overnight in LB-ampicillin medium. After dilution into fresh LB-ampicillin, the cultures were grown at 37 °C to A600 of 0.6–0.8 and induced with 0.4 mmisopropyl-d-thiogalactoside for 5 h at 37 °C or overnight at 25 °C. Protein expression in whole cell extracts was checked by centrifuging 1 ml of induced culture (14,000 rpm in a Microfuge), and the cell pellet was lysed by boiling in SDS-loading buffer for analysis by SDS-PAGE (27Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207129) Google Scholar) and Western blotting using anti-CarD polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies (see below). To check solubility of the expressed protein, the cell pellet (obtained as above) was suspended in buffer A (50 mm Tris, 2 mm EDTA, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, pH 7.5) and 200 mm NaCl, sonicated and centrifuged, and the supernatant and pellet were separately analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Proteins were purified in ice-cold conditions. Pelleted cells from 1-liter induced cultures (4–5 g of cell wet weight) were lysed by grinding with alumina (2 g/g of cell pellet) in the presence of 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and benzamidine. Alumina and cell debris were eliminated by centrifugation of the ground cell paste after suspension in 25–30 ml of buffer A containing 1m NaCl and 1 mm each of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and benzamidine. The resulting supernatant was mixed with polyethyleneimine to 0.3% final concentration to precipitate out DNA. Expressed proteins were recovered from the polyethyleneimine supernatant by ammonium sulfate precipitation at levels determined in pilot experiments: 50% for CarD, His6-CD-(1–104), and CD-(1–215), and 65% for CD-(183–316). CarD, CD-(183–316), and HMGA1a were purified off phosphocellulose and then by HPLC off a MonoS ion-exchange column (AKTA, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). CD-(1–215) was purified off DEAE-Sephadex and then by HPLC off a MonoQ column. CD-(1–104) was expressed with the His6 metal-affinity tag and purified from inclusion bodies employing TALON metal affinity resin and the accompanying purification protocol (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). Protein and fragment identities were confirmed by N-terminal amino acid sequencing (Applied Biosystems Procise-494 Protein Sequencer) and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry. Concentrations of CarD, CD-(1–104), and CD-(1–215) were determined from the 280-nm absorbance arising from Trp and Tyr present with ε280(m−1 cm −1) = 8,480 for CarD and CD-(1–215), and 6,990 for CD-(1–104) (28Pace C.N. Vajdos F. Fee L. Grimsley G. Gray T. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2411-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (3442) Google Scholar). The absorbance at 205 nm (29Scopes R.K. Anal. Biochem. 1974; 59: 277-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar) was used for CD-(183–316), and that at 220 nm for HMGA1a (ε220 = 74,000 m−1 cm−1; Ref. 30Reeves R. Nissen M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 265: 8573-8582Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Anti-CarD rabbit polyclonal and mouse monoclonal antibodies were obtained using standard procedures (31Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Supplement 13. Wiley, New York1995: 2.4.1-2.4.9Google Scholar). Immunization was performed with CarD excised off SDS-PAGE gels reversibly stained with Zn-imidazole negative staining (32Ortiz M.L. Calero M. Patron C.F. Castellanos L. Mendez E. FEBS Lett. 1992; 296: 300-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Epitope mapping of the polyclonal and monoclonal anti-CarD antibodies was done by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western blotting (ECLTM kit from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Subtilisin Carlsberg, proteinase K, papain, chymotrypsin, and trypsin (Sigma) protease stocks were stored at −70 °C as aliquots of 5 μg/μl in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm dithiothreitol. In pilot experiments at 28, 30, and 37 °C, protease was added to 240 μl of purified protein (50 μg/μl) in buffer A containing 0.2 m NaCl at 1:500 or 1:1000 (w/w) protein:protease. 40-μl aliquots were removed at 0, 5-, 10-, 15-, 20-, 30-, 45-, 60-, and 90-min intervals, the proteolysis quenched with 1 μl each of 1 m phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and benzamidine, and then analyzed by SDS-PAGE. For fragment identification, aliquots of a 15- or 45-min subtilisin digest at 28 °C were run on separate SDS-PAGE gels for Coomassie Blue staining, and for electrotransfer to nitrocellulose for Western analysis using anti-CarD antibodies or to an Immobilon PSQmembrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA) for N-terminal sequencing. Proteolytic fragments for mass spectrometry were purified by reverse-phase HPLC, or by identifying the band in SDS-PAGE gel by reversible Zn-imidazole negative staining (32Ortiz M.L. Calero M. Patron C.F. Castellanos L. Mendez E. FEBS Lett. 1992; 296: 300-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), excising it, and then leaching it off as described by Cohen and Chait (33Cohen S.L. Chait B.T. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 247: 257-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Intrinsic subtilisin activities at given salt concentrations were estimated from the hydrolysis of 1 mm TAME by subtilisin at 12.5 μg/ml in 3 ml of total reaction volumes (34Strzelecka-Golaszewska H. Moraczewska J. Khaitlina S.Y. Mossakowska M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 211: 731-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Hydrolysis rates were calculated from the initial linear increase in absorbance at 247 nm (ΔA247/min) monitored in a Kontron UVIKON 940 spectrophotometer equipped with a stirrer unit and a constant-temperature circulating water bath. Analytical HPLC size-exclusion data were obtained at room temperature using a Superdex-200 column equilibrated with buffer A with 200 mmNaCl, sufficient to minimize nonspecific interactions with the column matrix. Column calibration was done using vitamin B12(1.355 kDa), cytochrome c (12.4 kDa), carbonic anhydrase (29 kDa), ovalbumin (43 kDa), bovine serum albumin (66 kDa), yeast alcohol dehydrogenase (150 kDa), and β-amylase (200 kDa) (all from Sigma). 100-μl samples of CarD or each of its fragments at 10–100 μm were injected at 0.4 ml/min, and the elution was tracked by absorbance at 280, 235, and 220 nm. Void (Vo) and total (Vt) bed volumes were determined using blue dextran (2000 kDa; Sigma) and vitamin B12, respectively. Elution volumes, Ve, were assigned for CarD and each fragment in distinct runs by verifying peak identities by Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Stokes radii, RS (in nm) for the standards were obtained from Potschka (35Potschka M. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 47-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The following calibration curves were generated from the data for the standards employing SigmaPlot (Jandel Scientific) with correlation coefficients ≥0.99 in each case: log Mr = 7.91–0.23 Ve and Kav = 1.06–1.33 log RS, with Kav = (Ve −Vo)/(Vt −Vo). These were then used to estimate the apparent Mr and RS for CarD and each fragment (36Ackers G. Adv. Protein Chem. 1970; 24: 343-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Chemical cross-linking was examined with glutaraldehyde, DSS (Pierce Chemical Co.), or Ni-GGH (37Brown K.C. Yang S.-H. Kodadek T. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4733-4739Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). 2–5 μm pure protein in 200 mm NaCl, 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, was treated with a freshly prepared 5 mm glutaraldehyde (in water) or 25 mm DSS (in Me2SO) or 2 mm Ni-GGH to final concentrations of 1, 2.5, and 1 mm, respectively, and incubated for 1 h at 30 °C. Total reaction volumes were 100 μl. Cross-linking was quenched with SDS-PAGE gel-loading buffer (150 mm Tris final concentration) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Sedimentation equilibrium measurements were done in a Beckman Optima XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge, a Ti60 rotor and six-sector Epon charcoal centerpieces with 12-mm optical path length. 70-μl samples in 100 mmphosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 200 mm NaCl and 0.1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, were centrifuged to equilibrium at 13,000, 15,000, 18,000, or 25,000 rpm at 20 °C. Radial scans were acquired at 2-h intervals by monitoring at wavelengths between 220 and 280 nm, until successive scans were superimposable indicating equilibrium. 10 μm CarD, 25 μm CD-(1–215), and 200–300 μm for CD-(183–316) and HMGA1a were used, and a 50 μm CarD sample in buffer containing 1m NaCl was also examined. The apparent weight-average molecular masses (Mr) were determined by fitting data (using the programs EQASSOC, Beckman) to the equation for an ideal solution containing a single species as described elsewhere (38Minton A.P. Schuster T.M. Laue T.M. Modern Analytical Ultracentrifugation. Birkhauser, Boston, MA1994: 81-93Crossref Google Scholar, 39Hansen J.C. Lebowitz J. Demeler B. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 13155-13163Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Partial specific volumes, v¯ (in ml/g), calculated from the amino acid compositions (40Laue T.M. Shak B.D. Ridgeway T.M. Pelletier S.L. Harding S.E. Rowe A.J. Horton J.C. Analytical Ultracentrifugation in Biochemistry and Polymer Science. Royal Society of Chemistry, Cambridge, United Kingdom1992: 90-125Google Scholar), were set to 0.732 for CarD, 0.720 for CD- (183), 0.733 for CD-(1–215), and 0.718 for HMGA1a. CD spectra were recorded in a Jasco-810 spectropolarimeter coupled to a Neslab temperature control unit, using 0.2-nm steps at a scan speed of 20 nm/min and a 4-s time constant and averaged over 5 scans. A Hitachi F-4500 spectrofluorimeter equipped with a stirrer unit and a constant temperature circulating water bath was used for fluorescence spectra. Sample excitation was at 295 or 280 nm for a slit width of 2.5 nm, and the emission spectra, averaged over 2 scans, were recorded between 300 and 400 nm for a slit width of 10 nm at 240 nm/min and a 2-s response time. 10–30 μm protein and a 1-mm path length cuvette were employed for far-UV CD, while for fluorescence these were, respectively, 1–2.5 μm and 1 cm. All spectra were recorded at 25 °C in 200 mm NaCl, 100 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. Fluorescence spectra in denatured conditions were obtained in buffer containing 6 mguanidinium hydrochloride (Ultrapure from ICN Biomedicals, OH). EMSA for DNA binding employed the following synthetic DNA oligonucleotides and their respective complementary strands. (i) IRE, 5′-GAGAAGTGAAAGTGGGAAATTCCTCTGAATAGAGAGAGGAC-3′ (HMGA1a-binding sites underlined (26Thanos D. Maniatis T.

One of the probe strands was 32P-end-labeled and annealed with cold complementary strand. EMSA were carried out in 20 μl of total reaction volumes which contained: 1–3 pm end-labeled double-stranded probe (∼13,000 cpm); 50–300 nm CD-(183–316) or HMGA1a, or 300–1000 nm CarD; and 1 μg of double-stranded poly(dA-dT), poly(dG-dC) (Sigma), or poly(dI-dC) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The DNA-binding buffer was 50 mm NaCl, 15 mm HEPES, 4 mm Tris, pH 7.9, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40. After a 30-min equilibration at 4 °C, DNA binding was analyzed in nondenaturing 6% polyacrylamide gels (37.5:1 acrylamide:bis-acrylamide) pre-run at 200 V/4 °C for 30 min in 0.5 × TBE buffer (45 mm Tris base, 45 mmboric acid, 1 mm EDTA). Samples were electrophoresed for 1–1.5 h, and the gels dried and analyzed by autoradiography. In competition assays, unlabeled double-stranded IRE or QRS probe was also included at concentrations ranging from 1 to 20 pm. For comparing DNA binding of pure protein with its CKII-phosphorylated form, CarD, CD-(183–316), or HMGA1a at concentrations as above was first incubated at 30 °C for 2 h with or without 0.375 units of CKII and/or 125 mm ATP in 10 μl of 2 × DNA-binding buffer (see below) in separate 1.5-ml tubes. Labeled probe and 1 μg of poly(dG-dC) was then added to each tube to a total reaction volume of 20 μl, left to equilibrate for 30 min at 4 °C and analyzed by EMSA as before. CKII phosphorylation of purified CarD or fragments was examined using rat liver (Promega) or recombinant human CKII (New England BioLabs). 0.3–1 μmprotein was treated with 0.375 units of CKII and 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP or [γ-32P]GTP in CKII buffer (200 mm NaCl, 25 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 100 μm ATP) or DNA-binding buffer for at least 30 min at 30 °C. Unincorporated [γ-32P]NTP was removed by passing through a Sephadex G-50, and then examined by SDS-PAGE gel followed by autoradiography. Unstructured or partially structured regions of native proteins are more accessible and so more susceptible to protease action than compact structured domains. The latter are revealed on limited proteolysis of purified protein as the relatively resistant fragments visualized in SDS-PAGE gels (41Carey J. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 328: 499-514Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Domain organization of CarD was assessed by treatment of the protein with broad specificity proteases such as subtilisin and proteinase K. Fig.2 A shows the proteolytic cleavage pattern from limited proteolysis using subtilisin. (A similar pattern was observed with proteinase K.) Three discrete bands (numbered 1–3 in Fig. 2 A) and a group of bands (4 and 5 in Fig.2 A) were detectable 15 min after the initiation of proteolysis. Fragments corresponding to the group 4/5 persisted even after 45 min. Bands 1–5 were characterized by N-terminal sequencing, mass spectrometry, and Western blot analysis using anti-CarD polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies of known epitope specificities (see below). The analysis, summarized in Fig. 2 B, indicated the following. Four fragments could be identified from bands 4 and 5 which are the ones most resistant to proteolysis: a fragment corresponding to approximately the first 100 N-terminal residues, a fragment beginning at residue 157 and including the entire acidic region, and fragments which contain all or most of the AT-hook region. Bands 2 and 3 are two discrete, intense bands generated in the early steps of proteolysis. The fragments corresponding to these begin around residues 151 (band 2) or 185 (band 3) and span all of the C terminus of CarD. Thus the complete acidic AT-hook segment appears to constitute a relatively stable domain. The segment from residues 100 to 151 is highly susceptible to proteolysis and could constitute a loosely structured part of the protein. Structural stability is an important determinant of proteolytic susceptibility and so of intracellular degradation in E. coli (42Parsell D.A. Sauer R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7590-7595Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Consequently, fragments corresponding to stably folded domains are usually expressed to higher levels than those with little or no defined structure. This provides a means to assess whether a given protein segment constitutes an independently folded domain, and can be used to corroborate limited proteolysis data. We have done so for CarD by checking the expression of the following fragments: (i) the N-terminal region spanning residues 1–104, CD-(1–104); (ii) the acidic and basic AT-hook regions alone, CD-(183–316); (iii) the segment containing all four AT-hooks, CD-(225–316), or just the last three C-terminal ones, CD-(247–316). These fragments were chosen taking into account the results of the limited proteolysis experiments described above. All these fragments were expressed off plasmids constructed as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and none have as the penultimate N-terminal amino acid one that would confer a short half-life in bacteria (43Tobias J.W. Shrader T.E. Rocap G. Varshavsky A. Science. 1991; 254: 1374-1377Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). Fig. 3 shows the protein expression patterns for total extracts from cells in which expression of CarD (lane 3) or one of its fragments (lanes 4–9) was induced under equivalent conditions of growth and induction times. Like CarD, CD-(1–104) and CD-(183–316) were expressed at levels visually detectable by Coomassie Blue staining (shown boxed in lanes 4 and 7, respectively, in Fig. 3 A), but not CD-(225–316) or CD-(247–316) (lanes 5 and 6, respectively). An unambiguous identification of the above overexpressed bands was obtained from Western blots using polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies generated against purified CarD. The results obtained with polyclonal anti-CarD antibodies and with one of the two monoclonal antibodies generated are shown in Fig. 3, B and C, respectively. Polyclonal anti-CarD antibodies detected every one of the above fragments, including CD-(225–31"

We recently showed that deletion of the short C terminus (17 amino acids) of Syt IV prevented the Golgi localization of Syt IV proteins in PC12 cells and induced granular structures of various sizes in the cell body by an unknown mechanism (Fukuda, M., Ibata, K., and Mikoshiba, K. (2001) J. Neurochem. 77, 730–740). In this study we showed by electron microscopy that these structures are crystalloid endoplasmic reticulum (ER), analyzed the mechanism of its induction, and demonstrated that: (a) mutation or deletion of the evolutionarily conserved WHXL motif in the C terminus of the synaptotagmin family (Syt ΔC) destabilizes the C2B domain structure (i.e. causes misfolding of the protein), probably by disrupting the formation of stable anti-parallel β-sheets between the β-1 and β-8 strands of the C2B domain; (b) the resulting malfolded proteins accumulate in the ER rather than being transported to other membrane structures (e.g. the Golgi apparatus), with the malfolded proteins also inducing the expression of BiP (immunoglobulin binding protein), one of the ER stress proteins; and (c) the ERs in which the Syt ΔC proteins have accumulated associate with each other as a result of oligomerization capacity of the synaptotagmin family, because the Syt IΔC mutant, which lacks oligomerization activity, cannot induce crystalloid ER.

It consists of a short intravesicular N terminus, a single transmembrane domain, a spacer domain, a C2A domain, a C2B domain, and a short C terminus (reviewed in Refs. 1Marquèze B. Berton F.

Each domain of Syt I has been shown to be crucial to expression of its functions and to have a distinct role in the synaptic vesicle cycle. For instance, the short C terminus (WHXL motif) of Syt I is involved in synaptic vesicle docking to the presynaptic plasma membrane, probably by binding to certain plasma membrane receptors, such as neurexins (5Fukuda M.

The Ca2+ binding activity of the C2A domain is crucial for synaptic vesicle fusion to the presynaptic plasma membrane, because antibodies to the C2A domain that inhibits Ca2+/phospholipid or Ca2+/syntaxin binding to it interfere with the fusion step of secretory vesicles (6Mikoshiba K.

One of these domains, the N-terminal region of the C terminus, is highly conserved across phyla as well as different isoforms (Syts I–XIII), and it has been suggested to have functions common to the synaptotagmin family (5Fukuda M.

In this study we report a novel role of the WHXL motif of the synaptotagmin family in proper folding of the molecules. We have shown by deletion and mutation analyses that the WHXL motif is essential for correct folding of the C2B domain (i.e. the WHXL motif is located in the β-8 strand of the C2B domain rather than being an independent domain; see Fig. 3A). Expression of synaptotagmin mutants lacking the WHXL motif in cultured cells induced crystalloid endoplasmic reticulum (ER) structures (Refs. 36Pathak R.K. Luskey K.L. Anderson R.G. W J.

PC12 cells cultured on collagen-coated plastic coverslips (Sumitomo Bakelite, Tokyo, Japan) were fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) for 2 h. After washing in the buffer, cells were post-fixed in 1% OsO4 in 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) for 1 h. The cells were then washed in distilled water, incubated with 50% ethanol for 10 min, and stained with 2% uranyl acetate in 70% ethanol for 2 h. The cells were further dehydrated with a graded series of ethanol and embedded in epoxy resin. Ultra-thin sections were doubly stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate and then examined under a Hitachi H7000 electron microscope. pEF-T7-Syts and pEF-FLAG-Syts were cotransfected into COS-7 cells (5 × 105 cells the day before transfection/10-cm dish) as described previously (45Fukuda M. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27670-27676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Three days after transfection, cells were harvested and homogenized in 50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.2, 250 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 µm leupeptin, and 10 µm pepstatin A. The proteins expressed were solubilized with 1% Triton X-100, immunoprecipitated with anti-T7 tag antibody-conjugated agarose, and analyzed by 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) as previously described (38Fukuda M.

Co-immunoprecipitated FLAG-Syts were first detected with HRP-conjugated anti-FLAG antibody (1/10,000 dilution). The same blots were stripped and reprobed with HRP-conjugated anti-T7 tag antibody to ensure loading of the same amounts of T7-Syt proteins (1/10,000 dilution). PC12 cells (4 × 106 cells, the day before transfection) were cultured on 10-cm collagen type I-coated dishes (Becton Dickinson) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% horse serum and 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C under 5% CO2. Transfection was achieved by using the LipofectAMINE Plus reagent as described above. Immunoprecipitation of T7-Syts by anti-T7 tag antibody-conjugated agarose was performed as described previously (38Fukuda M. Kanno E. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31421-31427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar,39Fukuda M. Mikoshiba K. J. Biochem.

The beads were resuspended in 30 µl of the buffer (50 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.3, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% IGEPAL CA-630 (Sigma Chemical Co.), 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 µm leupeptin, and 10 µmpepstatin A) and then divided into two microtubes. After denaturation by boiling for 3 min and cooling to 37 °C, 5 milliunits of endoglycosidase H (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) was added to one tube, and the mixtures were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C (41Fukuda M. Ibata K. Mikoshiba K. J. Neurochem. 2001; 77: 730-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Reactions were stopped by adding SDS sample buffer and boiling for 3 min. Proteins were subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with HRP-conjugated anti-T7 tag antibody as described previously (38Fukuda M. Kanno E. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31421-31427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 39Fukuda M. Mikoshiba K. J. Biochem.

Syt IV-C2BΔ423–425 and mutant Syt IV-C2BΔ423–425(AAA) fused to glutathione S-transferase (GST) were prepared by a standard method (24Fukuda M. Aruga J. Niinobe M. Aimoto S. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29206-29211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 46Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene. 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5047) Google Scholar), and after incubating 4 µg of GST fusion proteins in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 100 mmNaCl with 1 ng/µl trypsin (Sigma Chemical Co.) for 0–30 min at 25 °C, the reactions were stopped by addition of SDS sample buffer and boiling for 3 min. Samples were then analyzed by 12.5% SDS-PAGE and staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. In the course of determining the Golgi localization signal of Syt IV in PC12 cells, we found that the deletion of the short C terminus (amino acid residues 409–425) prevented the Golgi localization of Syt IV and induced large granular structures of various sizes (Ref. 41Fukuda M. Ibata K. Mikoshiba K. J. Neurochem. 2001; 77: 730-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar and Fig. 1,A and C). Interestingly, these granular structures in which Syt IVΔC proteins had accumulated were easily identified on light-field micrographs (arrowheads in Fig.1D). Because they were also positive with anti-BiP antibody, a marker for the ER, we suspected that they represented crystalloid ER (36, 37; see also Fig. 1, E–G, arrows). Electron microscopic observation of the cells expressing Syt IVΔC revealed a unique membranous structure characteristic to “crystalloid ER” (36Pathak R.K. Luskey K.L. Anderson R.G. W J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 2158-2168Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar,37Yamamoto A. Masaki R. Tashiro Y. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1727-1738Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which is composed of tightly packed smooth ER cisternae (Fig.3H, arrowheads) or tubules (Fig. 3H,arrows). The crystalloid ER was occasionally continuous to rough ER cisternae (Fig. 3H, small arrows). To identify the amino acid residues responsible for the induction of crystalloid ER by expression of Syt IVΔC, we constructed various additional C-terminal deletion mutants (Fig.2A). After deletion of more than seven amino acids from the C terminus (FLAG-Syt IVΔ419–425), we observed mis-sorting of Syt IV mutant proteins and formation of crystalloid ER of various sizes within the cell body (Fig.2C, Δ414–425, Δ419–425 in green and TGN38 in red), but deletion of three amino acids did not affect the Golgi localization of Syt IV (Fig. 2C, Δ423–425,arrowheads). When the conserved WHML (amino acids 419–422) sequences were mutated to AAMA, expression of FLAG-Syt IVΔ423–425(AAA) induced granule formation similar to that of Syt IVΔC (Fig. 2C). Thus, the WHXL sequences are in some way related to the formation of crystalloid ER and the Golgi localization of Syt IV. Because deletion of the whole C2B domain (FLAG-Syt IVΔC2B) attenuated the crystalloid ER formation induced by deletion of the C terminus (ΔC) and Syt IVΔC2B proteins were localized in the Golgi (Fig. 2C, arrowhead incenter panel), the C2B domain was further systematically deleted from the C terminus, and the putative effector domain of the C2B domain was deleted or mutated to clarify the relationship between the C2B domain and the WHXL sequences (Fig. 2C) (25Fukuda M.

These mutations and deletions, however, failed to restore the Golgi localization of Syt IVΔC proteins (Fig. 2C, Δ329–425, Δ361–425, ΔC(341–347), and ΔC(KA) ingreen and TGN38 in red). The WHXL motif is highly conserved among the C-terminal type tandem C2 proteins, including the synaptotagmin family, rabphilin-3A, the Doc2 family, and the Slp family (synaptotagmin-likeprotein) (35Krasnov P.A. Enikolopov G. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1389-1404PubMed Google Scholar, 49Fukuda M. Mikoshiba K. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

However, recent demonstration of the three-dimensional structure of the C2B domain of Syt III (55Sutton R.B. Ernst J.A. Brunger A.T. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 589-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) and rabphilin-3A (56Ubach J. Garcia J. Nittler M.P. Südhof T.C. Rizo J. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 106-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) has provided strong evidence against this notion, and the WHXL motif must be a part of the C2B domain rather than an independent domain. The C2B domain of Syt III is composed of an eight-stranded anti-parallel β-sandwich structure consisting of four-stranded β-sheets (anti-parallel pairing of β-1 and β-8, β-2 and β-5, β-3 and β-4, and β-6 and β-7 strands), the same as the Syt I C2A domain (reviewed in Ref. 57Nalefski E.A. Falke J.J. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 2375-2390Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar; see also Fig.3A). The major difference between the C2A and C2B domains is that the C2B domain contains an additional α-helix region between the β-7 and β-8 strands (Fig.3A). It should be noted that this α-helix region was previously thought to be a β-8 strand of the C2B domain (Fig.3B, broken arrow) (55Sutton R.B. Ernst J.A. Brunger A.T. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 589-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 56Ubach J. Garcia J. Nittler M.P. Südhof T.C. Rizo J. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 106-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Based on these findings, together with the fact that crystalloid ER is induced by expression of malfolded proteins (58Ishihara N. Yamashina S. Sakaguchi M. Mihara K. Omura T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1995; 118: 397-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that deletion of a portion of the β-8 strand (the WHXL motif) of the C2B domain destabilizes the C2B domain structure (i.e. the C2B domain lacking the WHXL motif cannot fold correctly) and induces the crystalloid ER structures. If this hypothesis were true, deletion"

The cDNA sequence of the new protein encodes 541 amino acid residues. This cDNA sequence is identical to EHD4, a recently described member of the EH domain family of proteins. Two mRNAs of 4.4 and 3.0 kilobases were present in human skin fibroblasts and most tissues tested but were most prevalent in the heart. The chromosomal localization of the gene for this new protein was determined to be at 15q14-q15. Three polyclonal peptide antibodies were made against synthetic EHD4 peptides. The affinity-purified antibodies were used in immunofluorescent staining of developing limbs and matrices produced by human skin fibroblasts and mouse NIH3T3 fibroblasts in culture. Embryonic rat limb cartilage was strongly stained throughout development, and cultured fibroblasts deposited an extracellular filamentous network containing EHD4. In non-denaturing extracts of fetal bovine cartilage and in human skin fibroblast culture media, two components of ∼220 and 158 kDa were observed, which, after reduction, migrated as a 56-kDa component on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.

EHD4 is the first extracellular matrix protein described that contains an EH domain. Eps15 homology Eps15 homology domain 1 polymerase chain reaction open reading frame base pair(s) untranslated region polyclonal antibody polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis The EH domain (Eps15Homology)1 was first defined by Wong et al. (1Wong W.T. Schumacher C. Salcini A.E. Romano A. Castangnino P. Pelicci P.G. di Fiore P.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9530-9534Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) when characterizing Eps15, a substrate for the epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase. Subsequently, screening a human fibroblast expression library with EH domains identified several proteins that contained one or more copies of this motif (2Salcini A.E. Confalonieri S. Doria M. Santolini E. Tassi E. Minenkova O. Cesareni G. Pelicci P.G. Di Fiore P. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2239-2249Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). The EH domain contains 80–100 amino acid residues with 60 residues of consensus sequence and over 50% identity to one another. This domain usually contains a predicted calcium binding EF hand motif. A combinatorial phage display library was used to determine the target sequences that bind to the EH domains of Eps15 and Eps15R, which led to the identification of the tripeptide Asn-Pro-Phe as the optimal ligand (2Salcini A.E.

Some EH domains in other proteins recognized other motifs containing aromatic and hydrophobic amino acids such as Phe-Trp and Trp-Trp (3Paoluzi S. Castagnoli L. Lauro I. Salcini A.E. Coda L. Fre' S.

Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 488-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar) and signaling pathways (7Salcini A.E. Chen H. Iannolo G. De Camilli P. Di Fiore P.P. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 31: 805-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). To date, more than 40 EH domain-containing proteins have been reported (8Santolini E. Salcini A.E. Kay B.K. Yamabhai M. Di Fiore P.P. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 186-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). They are intracellular proteins found in organisms ranging from yeast to mammals, most of which have multiple EH domains located in their amino termini, adjacent to a coiled-coil domain. Recently, an EH protein family member called EHD1 (Eps15Homology Domain 1) was described (9Mintz L. Galperin E. Pasmanik-Chor M. Tulzinsky S. Bromberg Y. Kozak C.A. Joyner A. Fein A. Horowitz M. Genomics. 1999; 59: 66-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). This protein was originally called Hpast (GenBank™ accession number AF001434), because it was the human analogue of aDrosophila protein called PAST (putative achaete scute target, GenBank™ accession number U70135). EHD1 is a slightly atypical family member, because it contains a single EH domain at the carboxyl-terminal end of a coiled-coil domain and is the only coiled-coil-containing member with a single EH domain. Other than a calcium binding EF hand within the EH domain, no other recognizable domains were found in this 62-kDa protein. From Northern blot analysis it was highly expressed in testis, intestine, spleen, and kidney. Immunochemical analysis of mouse embryos showed that EHD1 was expressed in cartilage of the ribs and spinal column at day 15.5 postcoitus. Whole mount in situ hybridization showed thatEDH1 expression could be detected in limb buds and pharyngeal arches by day 9.5, in limb buds, sclerotomes, branchial arches, and occipital regions at day 10.5, but at day 17.5 there was no expression in the bones. Cellular localization experiments found EHD1 in several cytoplasmic vesicular structures, including the Golgi apparatus and endocytic vesicles. It is expressed by mesenchymal-derived cells or germ cells that are known to be induced by IGF1. Because of the structural similarities of EHD1 and Eps15, it was speculated that EHD1 is an insulin-like growth factor receptor substrate that mediates the endocytosis of the IGF1 receptor (9Mintz L. Galperin E. Pasmanik-Chor M. Tulzinsky S. Bromberg Y. Kozak C.A. Joyner A. Fein A. Horowitz M. Genomics. 1999; 59: 66-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Exon-trapping experiments identified three new human genes designatedEHD2, EHD3, and EHD4 because of their strong similarity to EHD1 (10Pohl U.T. Smith J.S. Tachibana I. Ueki K. Lee H.K. Ramaswamy S. Wu Q. Mohrenweiser H.W. Jenkins R.B. Louis D.N. Genomics. 2000; 63: 255-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The sequence of EHD3 was subsequently corrected in an EMBL/GenBank™ submission (accession number NM014600). The levels of amino acid identity between EHD1 and EHD2, EHD1 and EHD3, and EHD1 and EHD4 are 71%, 86%, and 76%, respectively. They show distinct expression patterns on multiple-tissue Northern blot analysis. Comparison of the amino acid sequences of EHD1–4 revealed almost identical single EH domains containing a predicted calcium binding EF hand. In addition, a bipartite nuclear localization signal and an ATP/GTP binding motif were identified. Surprisingly, no mention was made of the putative coiled-coil region previously identified in EHD1. We identified EHD4 during a search for proteins potentially involved in type VI collagen filament formation. Type VI collagen filaments are formed by end-to-end association of tetramers (11Kielty C.M. Whittaker S.P. Grant M.E. Shuttleworth C.A. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 979-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 12Kuo H.J. Keene D.R. Glanville R.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 232: 364-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Attempts to reconstitute filaments in vitro from purified type VI collagen tetramers failed, so we proposed that other ligands might be required for type VI collagen fibrillogenesis (12Kuo H.J. Keene D.R. Glanville R.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 232: 364-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). To find proteins that are potentially involved in type VI collagen filament assembly, the yeast two-hybrid system was used with selected amino- and carboxyl-terminal domains of each α(VI) chain to screen a human placenta library (13Kuo H.-J.

EHD4 was found using a bait peptide composed of most of C1 and C2–C5 domains of the α3(VI) carboxyl terminus (14Chu M.-L. Zhang R.-Z. Pan T.-C. Stokes D. Conway D. Kuo H.-J. Glanville R.W. Mayer U.

A Superscript preamplification system for first-strand cDNA synthesis and the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) kits were from Life Technologies. The Micropoly(A) Pure kit and the Northern Max-Gly kits were from Ambion. The Multiple tissue Northern blot and Protein Medleys (human heart, skeletal muscle, liver, lung, and placenta) were purchased from CLONTECH Laboratories, Inc.

The Supersignal substrate for Western blot,N-hydroxysuccinimide-long chain-biotin, Extravidin, the Imject activated immunogen conjugation kits, and the SulfoLink kit were purchased from Pierce Co. The human chondrocyte library was a gift from Dr. K. Doege (Shriners Hospital, Tampa, Fl). The human heart library was purchased from Origene Co. The primer sets and polypeptides for antibody preparations were synthesize by the core facility of Shriners Hospital in Portland. Normal human skin fibroblasts and mouse NIH3T3 cells were from the American Type Culture Collection. The isolation of an EHD4 clone (3C-110), containing a 5′-ORF of 294 bp and 3′-UTR without the poly(A) tail, from a two-hybrid screen of a human placenta library has been previously described (13Kuo H.-J.

The 5′-end of the sequence was extended by an additional 877 bp by screening a human heart library using the 3′-UTR as a probe and a human chondrocyte library using PCR amplification (94 °C, 10 min → 40 cycles (94 °C, 30 s; 55 °C, 30 s; 72 °C, 60 s) → 72 °C, 7 min → 4 °C) with the primer set designed from λgt11 phage (sense: AAGGCACATGGCTGAATATCGACG) and the known sequence (antisense: TCTAGTTTCCAGTGTCCACCCTCCCCAT; Fig. 1, position 1753–1780). The 459 bp of cDNA at the 5′-end, which included the initiation codon, was retrieved from the High Throughput Gene Sequences data bank by using the Advanced BLAST Search (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST). This sequence was checked by sequencing the product from a PCR amplification of human fibroblast cDNA using the primer set as follows: sense: ATGTTCAGCTGGATGGGGCG, position 1–20; and antisense: CCAGTGTCCACCCTCCCCATTCTACAG, position 1755–1772 (Fig. 1). Chromosomal localization of EHD4 was performed using the GeneBridge 4 radiation hybrid panel (Research Genetics, Inc.) according to the protocol provided with the panel. The PCR primer sets used in the screening were designed from the open reading frame (sense: GGCCAAGCACCTCATCAAGATCAAGCTC, position 1518–1545) and the 3′-UTR (antisense: ATCGGGGCACTGGGATGGAGGCACGC, position 2261–2286). This pair of primers generated a cDNA fragment of 767 bp. The results from screening all 93 templates in the hybrid panel were analyzed by the White Head Institute (www.genome.wi.mit.edu/cgi-bin/contig/rhmapper.pl). Three peptides for antibody preparation, selected from the translated amino acid sequence of EHD4 were synthesized with an addition cysteine residue at the carboxyl terminus. The polyclonal antibodies were prepared in New Zealand White rabbits. The peptide sequences are QDLFRDIQSLPQKAAVRKLNDC (Fig. 1, 279–299 for pAb 1050), GTTEGPFNQGYGEGAKEGADEEEWVVAKDKPVYDEC (Fig. 1, 418–453 for pAb 1051), and GKISGVNAKKEMVTSKLC (Fig. 1, 463–479 for pAb 1306). All the peptides were purified by high performance liquid chromatography on a C18 reverse phase support in 0.01% trifluoroacetic acid using an acetonitrile gradient, and their sequences and purity were checked by direct amino acid sequencing (Applied Biosystems 492) before use for antibody preparations. The peptides were linked to keyhole limpet hemocyanin via their carboxyl-terminal cysteine using the Imject activated immunogen kit. Each injection contained 100–200 μg of purified peptide mixed with an equal volume of Titemax classic adjuvant according to the manufacturer's instruction. A test bleed from each rabbit was collected after the initial injection and two consecutive boosts at 2-week intervals. The sera were purified over an antigen-linked agarose column, which was prepared according to the SulfoLink kit description. The titer of each antibody was checked using peptide-coated enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plates, and their ability to recognize native protein by indirect immunofluorescent staining of human or mouse frozen skin sections. Bovine fetal femur cartilage pieces were collected, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and ground to powder at −20 °C. They were extracted overnight with 3 volumes (v/w) of ice-cold 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 0.2m NaCl and the protease inhibitors 10 mm N-ethylmaleimide, 5 mm benzamidine, 10 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 0.2 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride. The tissue residue was collected by low speed centrifugation and then washed twice with the same buffer containing inhibitors and 1.0m NaCl, followed by overnight extraction with the same buffer containing inhibitors, 1.0 m NaCl, and 20 mm EDTA. The clarified EDTA extract was dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.3, containing 0.05 mNaCl and 2 m urea. The proteoglycan in the EDTA extract was removed using DEAE anion-exchange column chromatography. The column was equilibrated in the dialysis buffer and eluted with a 1-liter NaCl gradient from 0.1 to 0.3 m at room temperature. The EHD4-containing eluate from the anion-exchange column was further purified over a Sephacryl S-400 column (2.6 × 110 cm) equilibrated in 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, buffer containing 2m urea and 0.2 m sodium sulfate. Normal human skin fibroblasts and mouse NIH3T3 fibroblasts were grown in eight-well chamber slides (103cells/chamber) with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and 50 μg of ascorbate for 3–5 days. The chamber slides with confluent human skin fibroblasts or mouse NIH3T3 cells were treated with the ice-cold acetone for 2 min, air dried, and washed with phosphate-buffered saline before immunofluorescent staining with antibodies using standard procedures. The frozen tissue sections (5 μm) from different stages of rat embryo forelimb development were treated with acetone for 10 min and washed with phosphate-buffered saline before staining. Primary antibodies used were polyclonal antibodies against EHD4, type VI collagen, and type X collagen and monoclonal antibody against type II collagen. Negative controls used were the IgG fraction isolated from pre-immune rabbit sera and immune sera pre-treated with the peptide (1 mm) used for immunizing the rabbit. Multiple tissue Northern blots were done as described in the protocol fromCLONTECH using 32P-labeled 3C-110 as a probe, which consisted of 294 bp of EHD4 ORF and the entire 3′-UTR without the poly(A) tail. The mRNA of human skin fibroblasts and the fibroblast Northern blot were prepared according to protocols from the Micropoly(A) Pure kit and the Northern Max-Gly kit, respectively. The affinity blot procedure, using biotinylated type VI collagen as a soluble ligand, has been previously described (17Dietz H.C. Pyeritz R.E. Puffenberger E.G. Kendzior R.J. Corson G.M. Maslen C.L. Sakai L.Y. Francomano C.A. Cutting G.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 89: 1674-1680Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The entire assembled cDNA sequence of EHD4 and peptide translation, including the complete 3′-UTR is illustrated in Fig.1 A. Sequence analysis of clone 3C-110 revealed a short coding region of 294 bp which encodes 98 amino acid residues containing an EF hand calcium binding motif, followed by a 3′-untranslated region (Fig. 1, 1339–2872). Most of the 5′-ORF sequence was found in the human cartilage library (644–1338), and the sequence from positions 322 to 643 was from the human heart library. The 5′-UTR, including the first 321 bases of coding sequence, was first obtained from a genomic clone in the High Throughput Gene Sequences data bank (accession number AC039056); however, upon checking, the sequence was found to have one codon missing and two incorrect bases. The poly(A)-tail was from the Expressed Sequence Tag data bank (AI341440, reverse). During the course of these investigations, a new group of EH domain-containing protein sequences were entered into the EMBL/GenBank™ data base that were highly similar to EHD1 and were consequently named EHD2, EHD3, and EHD4 (lacking part of the ORF and UTR) (10Pohl U.T. Smith J.S. Tachibana I. Ueki K. Lee H.K. Ramaswamy S. Wu Q. Mohrenweiser H.W. Jenkins R.B. Louis D.N. Genomics. 2000; 63: 255-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). EHD4 was identical to the protein described here; therefore, the name EHD4 was adopted. The completed EHD4 cDNA sequence reported here consists of an open reading frame of 1620 bp with the proposed translation-initiating methionine in the strong Kozak consensus sequence context RNNatgY (18Kozak M. Mamm. Genome. 1996; 7: 563-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar). Chromosomal localization of the EDH4 gene on the physical map of chromosome 15 is illustrated in Fig. 2. Nearby markers WI-13757 and WI-11636 have been positioned on the radiation hybrid map enabling EDH4 to be assigned to 15q14-q15. The domain analysis of the EHD4 protein amino acid sequence using the Simple Modular Architecture Research Tool (SMART; smart.embl-heidelberg.de) revealed a unique amino-terminal domain, a potential coiled-coil domain, and an EH domain with an embedded EF hand calcium binding motif (Fig. 1 B). EHD4 contains four cysteine residues, two in the amino-terminal region and two in the calcium binding EF hand motif. Compared with the other EHD proteins, EDH4 has a low score for coiled-coil domain formation using the programs COILS (www.ch.embnet.org/software/COILS_form.html) and Multicoil (nightingale.lcs.mit.edu/cgi-bin/multicoil). There is a predicted ATP/GTP binding site at the amino terminus and a possible bipartite nuclear recognition site in the center of a coiled-coil domain (PSORT program analysis psort.nibb.ac.jp). No signal peptide at the amino terminus was detected (SignalP program, www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/SignalP). To determine the tissue distribution of the gene, a multiple tissue Northern blot and human skin fibroblast mRNA were probed using the cDNA insert of clone 3C-110. Two messages of 4.4 and 3.0 kb were detected, the smaller of the two being more abundant in all tested tissues and fibroblasts (Fig. 3). Heart had the highest message level followed by pancreas, kidney, placenta, and lung. Fibroblasts also expressed high levels of message. To identify and characterize EDH4 protein in tissues, three polyclonal peptide antibodies were made against peptides selected from the coiled-coil domain (pAb 1050), the junction of coiled-coil and EH domains (pAb 1051), and from the EH domain (pAb 1306). The epitope positions are indicated in Fig.1 A. All antibodies recognize the same bands in Western blots of bovine cartilage extracts and fibroblast culture medium (see below). Immunofluorescent staining of fibroblasts culture matrix and tissues was also identical with each antibody (not shown). In 18-day-old rat embryo limb sections, EHD4 is confined to the cartilage matrix and co-distributed with type II collagen in the extracellular matrix except at the articular surface. Fig.4 (A and D) shows the similar distributions of EHD4 and type II, respectively, in the elbow. Fig. 4 B shows an enlargement of the ulna/humerus stained with EHD4, and Fig. 4 C shows the same view stained with EHD4 antibodies preincubated with the peptide used to make the antibody. This negative control demonstrates the specificity of the observed staining. At the articular surface, there is a narrow zone that contains type II collagen, but EHD4 is absent. Enlargements of the ulner/humerus interface are shown in Fig. 4, E andF. In Fig. 4 E, EHD4 is stained greenand the cell nuclei red, and at the surface of the cartilage there is a region delineated by the presence of cell nuclei that does not contain EHD4. However, this same region is stained for type II collagen (Fig. 4 F). Earlier in development at day 14, when EHD4 first appears, EHD4 and type II collagen do not co-distribute. In the clavicle, type II staining delineates the whole bone (Fig.4 H), whereas EHD4 is restricted more to the mid-diaphysis where chondrocytes differentiation is more advanced and where primary endochondral ossification will ultimately initiate (Fig.4 G). It appears while type II collagen is produced early in the differentiation of the condensing mesenchyme to chondroblasts, and EHD4 is produced slightly later in development by more differentiated chondrocytes. The next change in distribution observed occurs just prior to the formation of the secondary centers of ossification. Fig. 4 I shows a bone epiphysis 5 days postpartum in which EHD4 labeling is diminished in the center but type II collagen staining is still uniform (Fig. 4 L). Type X collagen, which is a marker for hypertrophic chondrocytes and endochondral ossification, is not expressed in this region (Fig. 4 J), only in the metaphyseal growth plates. At this stage type VI collagen is concentrated at the articular surface of the epiphysial cartilage (Fig.4 K). Two days later, type X collagen appears in the secondary center of ossification (Fig. 4 N). A large area devoid of EHD4 (Fig. 4 M) still labels for type II collagen (Fig. 4 P). It has a course appearance indicating a physical change in the structure of the cartilage matrix caused by the hypertrophy of chondrocytes and degradation of cartilage prior to calcification. Type VI collagen remains concentrated at the epiphysial surface (Fig. 4 O) while EHD4 continues to be excluded from the developing articular cartilage. Because the Northern blot analysis indicated that EHD4 was expressed by fibroblasts, cultures of normal human skin fibroblasts and mouse NIH3T3 fibroblasts were grown to confluence and immunofluorescently labeled to better determine whether EHD4 is an extracellular or an intracellular protein. The proteins in the fibroblast culture medium and cell/matrix extracts were analyzed by Western blot analysis, and the distribution of EHD4 was examined by indirect immunofluorescent staining of fibroblasts grown on chamber slides. The results demonstrated that fibroblasts secreted EHD4 into the media (Fig. 5 A). Western blot analysis with an affinity-purified antibody showed disulfide-linked EHD4 oligomers of 158 and 220 kDa were present in unreduced media and a monomer of 56 kDa after reduction. From the apparent molecular masses it would appear that the oligomers are trimers and tetramers, but, owing to the anomalous behavior of these proteins in SDS-PAGE, this is not certain. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis revealed that both high molecular mass bands are reduced to a 56-kDa band recognized by an EHD4 antibody (data not shown). Therefore, it was concluded that both components are oligomers of EHD4. Furthermore, both mouse and human fibroblast cell cultures deposited an extracellular fibrillar network containing EHD4 (Fig.5 B). To chemically confirm the presence of EHD4 in cartilage, fetal bovine femoral cartilage was extracted with a series of buffers with increasing matrix-solubilizing properties. It was found that most EHD4 was extracted in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 1m NaCl and 20 mm EDTA (Fig.6). The bands recognized by EHD4 antibodies in low salt and high salt-containing Tris buffer without EDTA were thought to be degradation products of EHD4, because they varied in pattern and intensity from one preparation to the next (Fig.6 B). EHD4 protein was purified from the EDTA extract by separation on DEAE-cellulose. Bound material was further chromatographed over a Sephacryl S-400 column (Fig.7). The apparent sizes of EHD4 protein isolated from culture media and cartilage are identical.Figure 7Purification of EHD4. The EDTA extract shown in Fig. 6, lane 3 was applied to a DEAE anion-exchange column, and the bound fraction was collected. The chromatographic profile shown is from the separation of the EHD4 containing DEAE fraction on a Sephacryl S-400 molecular sieve column (2.6 × 110 cm) equilibrated with 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, containing 2m urea and 0.2 m sodium sulfate. Theinset shows the Western blot (pAb 1306) on theleft, and the Coomassie Blue-stained 7.5% polyacrylamide gel is on the right. The numbers of thelanes on the gel correspond to the numbered fractions on the profile. All samples were unreduced.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The affinity of EHD4 for type VI collagen was confirmed by affinity blots of fetal bovine cartilage extract with biotinylated type VI collagen tetramers (Fig.8). The results showed that the type VI collagen tetramers and EHD4 polyclonal antibody (pAb 1050) recognized the same 158- and 220-kDa components in the gel. Further binding studies (not shown) using EHD4 immobilized on enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plates and fragments of type VI collagen demonstrated that the binding site was localized in the globular domain of type VI collagen and that the native domain is capable of binding EHD4. Similar assays showed that collagens I, II, III, and V had no affinity for EHD4. Thus, type VI collagen and EHD4 have an affinity for each other in vitro, which confirms the interaction detected in the two-hybrid screen. As type VI collagen filaments formed in cultures of WI38, HT1080, and MG63 cells in the absence of EHD4 (not shown), EHD4 is not required for type VI collagen formation. Furthermore, the distributions of EHD4 and type VI collagen in cartilage are quite distinct, type VI collagen being concentrated at the periphery of epiphysial cartilage where EHD4 is at its weakest or absent. However, there is a low concentration of type VI collagen in the inter-territorial cartilage matrix (19Keene D.R. Engvall E. Glanville R.W. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 1995-2006Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar) where EHD4 is also found, and so an interaction is possible there. EHD4 is a unique extracellular matrix protein in that it contains an EH domain with an embedded calcium binding EF hand. These are characteristics of a family of EH domain-containing proteins related to Eps15 that were previously thought to be exclusively intracellular. The four EHD proteins are a subset of this family with high sequence similarity. EHD4 was previously assumed to be an intracellular protein because of its structural similarit"
https://openalex.org/W2071670180,"In ATP synthase (F(O)F(1)-ATPase) ion flow through the membrane-intrinsic portion, F(O), drives the central rotor, subunits c(10)epsilongamma, relative to the ab(2)delta(alphabeta)(3). This converts ADP and P(i) into ATP. Vice versa, ATP hydrolysis drives the rotation backwards. Covalent cross-links between rotor and stator subunits have been shown to inhibit these activities. Aiming at the rotary compliance of subunit gamma we introduced disulfide bridges between gamma (rotor) and alpha or beta (stator). We engineered cysteine residues into positions located roughly at the top, center, and parts of the coiled-coil portion of gamma and suitable residues on alpha or beta. This part of gamma is located at the center of the (alphabeta)(3) domain with its C-terminal part at the top of F(1) and the bottom part close to the F(O) complex. Disulfide bridge formation under oxidizing conditions was quantitative as shown by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting. As expected both the ATPase activities and the yield of rotating subunits gamma dropped to zero when the cross-link was formed at the center (gammaL262C alphaA334C) and bottom (gammaCys(87) betaD380C) positions. But much to our surprise disulfide bridging impaired neither ATP hydrolysis activity nor the full rotation of gamma and the enzyme-generated torque of oxidized F(1), which had been engineered at the top position (gammaA285C alphaP280C). Apparently the high torque of this rotary engine uncoiled the alpha-helix and forced amino acids at the C-terminal portion of gamma into full rotation around their dihedral (Ramachandran) angles. This conclusion was supported by molecular dynamics simulations: If gammaCys(285)-Val(286) are attached covalently to (alphabeta)(3) and gammaAla(1)-Ser(281) is forced to rotate, gammaGly(282)-Ala(284) can serve as cardan shaft."
https://openalex.org/W2014865586,"Hyperhomocysteinemia represents an independent risk factor for atherosclerosis, but the mechanisms leading to cellular dysfunctions remain unknown. Using ECV304 cells, we found that homocysteine (Hcy) plus copper (Cu2+) induced cytotoxic effects: loss of cell adhesion, increased permeability to PI, and the occurrence of morphologically apoptotic cells. This form of apoptosis, inhibited by Z-VAD-fmk, was associated with a loss of mitochondrial potential, a cytosolic release of cytochrome c, activation of caspase-3, degradation of poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase, and internucleosomal DNA fragmentation. However, the ability of Hcy plus Cu2+ to induce apoptosis decreased when the pretreatment culture time increased. As a positive correlation was found between the length of time of culture before treatment and the enhancement of gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (gamma-GT) activity, we asked whether gamma-GT was involved in the control of Hcy plus Cu2+-induced apoptosis. Therefore, ECV304 cells were treated with either acivicin or dexamethasone, inhibiting and stimulating gamma-GT, respectively. In ECV304 cells and human umbilical venous endothelial cells, acivicin favored Hcy plus Cu2+-induced apoptosis whereas dexamethasone counteracted the apoptotic process. As acivicin and dexamethasone were also capable of modulating cell death in ECV304 cells treated with antitumoral drugs, our data emphasize that the involvement of gamma-GT in the control of apoptosis is not restricted to Hcy but also concerns other chemical compounds."

In this study the potential for genomics to reveal unanticipated pharmacological properties of phenolic antioxidants is explored. It was found that two anti-atherogenic compounds, BO-653 and probucol, inhibited the expression of three α-type proteasome subunits, PMSA2, PMSA3, and PMSA4 in human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Here we report that both BO-653 and probucol caused not only inhibition of the mRNA levels of these three subunits but also inhibition of both the gene expression and protein synthesis of the α-type subunit, PMSA1. Other subunit components of the proteasome such as the β-type subunits (PMSB1, PMSB7), the ATPase subunit of 19 S (PMSC6), the non-ATPase subunit of 19 S (PMSD1), and PA28 (PMSE2) were not significantly affected by treatment with these compounds. The specific inhibition of α-type subunit expression in response to these antioxidants resulted in functional alterations of the proteasome with suppression of degradation of multiubiquitinated proteins and IκBα.

For example, these methods enable comparison of the levels of gene and protein expression between diseased and normal cells or cells treated with pharmacological agents. Atherosclerosis is an interesting example in this respect because it is a complex chronic inflammatory condition resulting from the interaction between modified lipoproteins, monocyte-derived macrophages, and other cellular elements of artery wall in which numerous pharmacological agents have been tested for efficacy (1Lusis A.J. Nature. 2000; 407: 233-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (4735) Google Scholar, 2Glass C.K. Witztum J.L. Cell. 2001; 104: 503-516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2654) Google Scholar). Indeed, one important class of molecules assessed in these models are generically classified as antioxidants, and the anti-atherogenic effects of these compounds have contributed to the evolution of the LDL1oxidation hypothesis of atherosclerosis. However, the detailed mechanisms of antioxidant compounds, such as probucol, remain complex and elusive with a number of biological responses identified, which are not easily reconciled with a unique mechanism depending solely on free radical scavenging. Recently, we have applied the oligonucleotide microarrays analysis (HuGene human FL array, Affimetrix, Inc., Santa Clara, California) to determine the effects of two anti-atherogenic phenolic compounds, 2,3-dihydro-5-hydroxy-2,2-dipentyl-4,6-di-tert-butylbenzofuran (BO- 653)and 4,4′-isopropylidenedithio-bis-(2,6-di-tert-butylphenol) (probucol) on gene expression in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). Probucol has been used clinically as an anti-atherogenic compound due to its lipid-lowering properties, while its antioxidant properties subsequently emerged from a combination of in vitro (3Kuzuya M Kuzuya F. Free Rad. Biol. Med. 1993; 14: 67-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 4Gotoh N. Shimizu K. Komuro E. Tsuchiya J. Noguchi N. Niki E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1128: 147-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) and in vivo models of the atherosclerotic processes (5Carew T.E. Schwenke D.C. Steinberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

However, the mechanisms underlying probucol action remain important. For example, recent studies have shown that probucol is effective in reducing the incidence of restenosis after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) (7Tardif J.C. Cote G.

It has been also reported that probucol inhibits expression of adhesion molecules such as vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) both in animal models (9Fruebis J. Gonzalez V. Silvestre M.

Not withstanding the continuing interest in probucol molecular mechanisms remain obscure with several controversial results with probucol observed in different animal models. For example, probucol effectively inhibited development of atherosclerosis in Watanabe heritable hyperlipidemia (WHHL) rabbits (5Carew T.E. Schwenke D.C. Steinberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 7725-7729Crossref PubMed Scopus (940) Google Scholar, 6Kita T. Nagano Y. Yokode M. Ishii K. Kume N. Ooshima A. Yoshida H. Kawai C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Avdievich E. Surles L.K. Jones R.G. Reynolds J.B. Quarfordt S.H. Maeda N. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 2858-2866Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) and LDL receptor knockout mice (14Cynshi O. Kawabe Y. Suzuki T. Takashima Y. Kaise H. Nakamura M. Ohba Y. Kato Y. Tamura K. Hayasaka A. Higashida A. Sakaguchi H. Takeya M. Takahashi K. Inoue K. Noguchi N. Niki E. Kodama T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10123-10128Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The responses in apoE knockout mice were particularly interesting with a recent report showing that lesion development was increased by probucol in the aortic root yet decreased in the aortic arch (15Witting P.K. Pettersson K. Letters J. Stocker R. Arterioscler. Thronb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: e26-e33Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These studies implicate mechanisms that are more complex than simple scavenging of lipid peroxyl radicals and encompass processes that involve site-specific modulation of gene transcription in the endothelium. It remains uncertain whether the antioxidant properties of probucol and its lipid-lowering effects are related or critical for the anti-atherogenic effects in humans. The LDL oxidation hypothesis of atherosclerosis also prompted a series of initiatives to elaborate and improve on the antioxidant component of probucol. The compound, BO-653, is such an example and shares the structural motif for scavenging peroxyl radicals, the phenol group, while the rest of the molecule is structurally distinct from probucol (Fig. 1). It was found that BO-653 exerted a potent antioxidant activity against lipid peroxidation (16Noguchi N. Iwaki Y. Takahashi M. Komuro E. Kato Y. Tamura K. Cynshi O. Kodama T. Niki E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 342: 236-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and oxidative modification of LDL (17Noguchi N. Okimoto Y. Tsuchiya J. Cynshi O. Kodama T. Niki E. Arch. Biochem.

Surprisingly, it is about 10 times more effective than probucol as an antioxidant yet still requires similar concentrations to exert anti-atherogenic properties. We hypothesized that properties other than the antioxidant activity of these compounds could contribute to inhibition of atherosclerosis. The use of genomic analysis to elucidate the mechanisms of pharmacological agents is an important application of this emerging technology. Indeed, a novel and unexpected finding derived from gene chip analysis (18Takabe W. Mataki C. Wada Y. Ishii M. Izumi A. Aburatani H. Hamakubo T. Niki E. Kodama T. J. Atheroscl. Thromb. 2001; 7: 223-230Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar) indicated that regulation of proteasome function could occur on exposure of HUVEC to phenolic antioxidants. The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway has been shown to be involved in various biologically important processes, such as the cell cycle, cellular metabolism, apoptosis, signal transduction, immune response, and protein quality control (19Coux O. Tanaka K. Goldberg A.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 801-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (2239) Google Scholar, 20Rechsteiner M. Ubiquitin and the Biology of the Cell.

Struct. 1999; 28: 295-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). Consequently, this proteolytic machinery is capable of catalyzing the turnover of proteins in a regulated fashion. The potential of a pharmacological agent to modulate proteasome function through transcriptional regulation has not been reported previously. The complete catalytic complex, the 20 S proteasome, is a barrel-like particle appearing as a stack of four rings made up of two outer α-rings and two inner β-rings. The α- and β-rings are each made up of seven structurally similar α- and β-subunits, respectively (23Bochtler M. Ditzel L. Groll M. Hartmann C. Huber R. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1999; 28: 295-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). The regulatory complex termed PA700 (also called the 19 S complex) associates with 20 S proteasome to form the 26 S proteasome with a molecular mass of ∼2500 kDa (24Baumeister W. Walz J. Zuhl F. Seemuller E. Cell. 1998; 92: 367-380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1310) Google Scholar). Moreover, another proteasome activator PA28 (11 S REG), consisting of α and β subunits, is known to bind to the α-ring of the 20 S proteasome (19Coux O. Tanaka K. Goldberg A.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 801-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (2239) Google Scholar). In this report we show that the selective inhibition of the α-type subunits of the 20 S proteasome in HUVEC treated with either probucol or BO-653 results in suppression of proteasome activity. 2,3-Dihydro-5-hydroxy-2,2-dipentyl-4,6-di-tert-butylbenzofuran (BO-653) was a kind gift from the Chugai Pharmaceutical Co (Shizuoka, Japan). 4,4′-Isopropylidenedithio-bis-(2,6-di-tert-butylphenol) (Probucol) was kindly supplied by the Daiichi Pharmaceutical Co (Tokyo, Japan). Fetal bovine serum was obtained from JRH Biosciences (Lenexa, KA). Monoclonal antibody against multiubiquitinated chains and polyclonal antibody against IκBα were obtained from MBL (Nagoya, Japan) and ROCKLAND (Gilbertsville, PA), respectively. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC s) were obtained from a commercial source (Clonetics Corp, Walkersville, MD) and grown in endothelial cell growth factor containing medium-2 (EGM-2, Clonetics Corp) with 2% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. All experiments were completed within four passages. After reaching confluency, the medium was replaced by endothelial basement medium (EBM) 2 h before the addition of the antioxidants. The final concentration of BO-653 and probucol was 50 µm, except for the concentration-dependent experiments and selected on the basis of the plasma levels in animals and humans (25Touitou R. Richardson J. Bose S. Nakanishi M. Rivett J. Allday M.J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2367-2375Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Antioxidants were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO, SIGMA), which was diluted with EBM resulting in a final Me2SO concentration of 0.01%. The control cells were cultured in EBM containing 0.01% Me2SO in the absence of antioxidant. Oligonucleotide microarray analysis was performed by using gene chip, the HuGene human FL array (Affymetrix Inc., Santa Clara, CA) as described (18Takabe W. Mataki C. Wada Y. Ishii M. Izumi A. Aburatani H. Hamakubo T. Niki E. Kodama T. J. Atheroscl. Thromb. 2001; 7: 223-230Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Total RNA was extracted by the method of Chomczynski et al. (26Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar). Samples of 5 µg of total RNA were denatured and separated by electrophoresis on a 1% agarose gel containing 2.2 mformaldehyde. Total RNA was then transferred to Hybond-XL nylon membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and hybridized with32P-labeled probes as described previously (27Fujiwara T. Tanaka K. Kumatori A. Shin S. Yoshimura T. Ichihara A. Tokunaga F. Aruga R. Iwanaga S. Kakizuka A. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 7332-7340Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). For the Northern blot analysis of proteasomes, the cDNAs for the subunits PMSA1 (HC2), PMSA2 (HC3), PMSA3 (HC8), and PMSA4 (HC9) of human proteasomes were constructed according to the literature (28Feinberg A.P. Vogelstein B. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 137: 266-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (5190) Google Scholar) and the cDNA of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was used as a standard. These probes were labeled with a random primer labeling kit, the BCA BESTTM Labeling kit (Takara, Shizuoka, Japan), using [α-32P]dCTP. The membranes were washed as described previously (29Kumatori A. Tanaka K. Inamura N. Sone S. Ogura T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 7071-7075Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar) and autoradiographed with a BAS-1800 (Fuji Photo Film Co., Tokyo, Japan). To measure the stability of the proteasome subunit mRNA, cells were treated with actinomycin D (5 µg/ml), an inhibitor of transcription of mRNA as well as an antioxidant treatment as described (30Umetani M. Nakao H. Doi T. Iwasaki A. Ohtaka M. Nagoya T. Mataki C. Hamakubo T. Kodama T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 272: 370-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested and pelleted at 200 × g for 3 min. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and disrupted by sonication in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4) containing 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.25 m sucrose, and 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The homogenates were centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, and the resulting supernatants were used for analysis. Samples (5 µg) separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in 10% gel were transferred electrophoretically to HybondTM ECLTM nylon membranes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 2 h at 80 V. The membranes were pretreated with Block Ace (Yukijirushi Co., Sapporo, Japan) and then treated with monoclonal antibodies, which were raised against human PMSA1 (HC2), PMSB7 (Z), PMSC6 (p42), PMSD1 (p112), and PMSE2 (PA28β) (28Feinberg A.P. Vogelstein B. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 137: 266-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (5190) Google Scholar). After treatment with peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG monoclonal antibody (SIGMA) or anti-rabbit IgG monoclonal antibody (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), labeled bands from washed blots were detected by Super Signal West Dura Extended Duration Substrate (Pierce, Rockford, IL). Membranes were exposed to FUJI MEDICAL X-RAY FILM (Fuji Photo Film Co., Tokyo, Japan) at room temperature. To detect the multiubiquitinated proteins and IκBα, after treatment of cells with 100 µg/ml cycloheximide dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline for 2 h the cells were treated with either 50 µm BO-653 or probucol for 12 h. Control cells were treated with vehicle (Me2SO, 0.01%). After electrophoresis under the same conditions to detect the proteasome subunits, the membrane was treated with monoclonal antibody against the multiubiquitinated proteins or polyclonal antibody against IκBα. Protein concentrations were measured with a BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). Gene chip analysis revealed a decrease in the levels of mRNA encoding proteasome α-type subunits, PMSA2(HC3), PMSA3(HC8), and PMSA4(HC9) in HUVEC exposed to the phenolic antioxidants, probucol (50 µm) and BO-653 (50 µm) for 6 h (TableI). These concentrations are equivalent to those achieved in both human and animal studies (14Cynshi O. Kawabe Y. Suzuki T. Takashima Y. Kaise H. Nakamura M. Ohba Y. Kato Y. Tamura K. Hayasaka A. Higashida A. Sakaguchi H. Takeya M. Takahashi K. Inoue K. Noguchi N. Niki E. Kodama T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10123-10128Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 25Touitou R. Richardson J. Bose S. Nakanishi M. Rivett J. Allday M.J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2367-2375Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). The gene chip analysis can result in false positives, and thus the responses were carefully validated and extended in the first series of experiments using Northern blot analysis. It is clear that treatment of HUVEC with either BO-653 or probucol results in a decreased expression of these three genes at 6 h (Fig. 2,A, B, and C). The gene chip used in the present study contains only a subset of the proteasome subunits (Table I). To test for changes in the mRNA for other α-type subunits not included on this analysis the message for PMSA1 (HC2) was determined. In this case, the mRNA level decreased to its minimum over 3–6 h on exposure to BO-653 or probucol and recovered by 12 h (Fig. 2, D and E). To test for the possibility that the antioxidants may enhance degradation of mRNA, we investigated the effect of BO-653 and probucol on mRNA levels observed in cells treated with actinomycin D, an inhibitor of transcription. Neither BO-653 nor probucol affected the rate of mRNA degradation as shown for PMSA2 (Fig. 2F). The decreased mRNA for PMSA1 on exposure to the antioxidants was also found to result in decreased protein levels of PMSA1 after a 12-h exposure, with levels making a partial recovery to control values at 24 h (Fig. 3). To determine the concentration dependence of the antioxidants, mRNA levels and protein levels of PMSA1 in cells treated with different concentrations (1, 10, 50 µm) of either BO-653 or probucol were measured. These antioxidants inhibited both levels of message and protein of PMSA1 in a dose-dependent manner with maximal effects achieved with the 1 µm BO-653 and 50 µm probucol (Table II).Table IEffect of BO-653 and probucol on proteasome subunits studied by gene chipSubunits of proteasomal complexesGene No.NameAverage differenceFoldchange (ranking no.)Me2SOBO-653probucolBO-653probucolα-type subunitsD00762PSMA3 (HC8)1-aThe effects of BO-653 and probucol were investigated by Northern and/or Western blot analysis.557314112492−4.5 (1)1-bThe fold change was calculated as previously described (18), and ranking no. was given to significantly down-regulated genes.−2.2 (4)1-bThe fold change was calculated as previously described (18), and ranking no. was given to significantly down-regulated genes.D00763PSMA4 (BC9)1-aThe effects of BO-653 and probucol were investigated by Northern and/or Western blot analysis.742519733619−3.8 (2)1-bThe fold change was calculated as previously described (18), and ranking no. was given to significantly down-regulated genes.−2.1 (5)1-bThe fold change was calculated as previously described (18), and ranking no. was given to significantly down-regulated genes.D00760PSMA2 (HC3)1-aThe effects of BO-653 and probucol were investigated by Northern and/or Western blot analysis.656817923396−3.2 (4)1-bThe fold change was calculated as previously described (18), and ranking no. was given to significantly down-regulated genes.−1.7 (17)1-bThe fold change was calculated as previously described (18), and ranking no. was given to significantly down-regulated genes.β-type subunitsD00761PMSB1 (HC5)1-aThe effects of BO-653 and probucol were investigated by Northern and/or Western blot analysis.999653787274−1.9−1.4D26599PMSB2 (HC7)813673168006−1.0−1.0D26598PMSB3 (HC10)729677297136−1.0−1.0D26600PMSB4590762466215−1.0−1.0D29012PMSB6 (Y)16463931012064−1.8−1.4D38048PMSB7 (Z)1-aThe effects of BO-653 and probucol were investigated by Northern and/or Western blot analysis.958663658009−1.5−1.2Z14982PMSB8−159115−192——ATPase subunits of 19 SD78275PMSC61-aThe effects of BO-653 and probucol were investigated by Northern and/or Western blot analysis.1242568920−1.9−1.4non-ATPase subunits of 19 SD44466PMSD11-aThe effects of BO-653 and probucol were investigated by Northern and/or Western blot analysis.425220802140−1.9−1.6D78151PMSD25774743069001.21.2D50063PMSD7434628263554−1.5−1.2D38047PMSD812384913310604−1.4−1.2AB003177PMSD9225916371715−1.4−1.3AB003102PMSD111611174015871.1−1.0AB003103PMSD12263202244−1.3−1.1PA28 (11 S regulator)D45248PMSE21-aThe effects of BO-653 and probucol were investigated by Northern and/or Western blot analysis.430930553200−1.4−1.31-a The effects of BO-653 and probucol were investigated by Northern and/or Western blot analysis.1-b The fold change was calculated as previously described (18Takabe W.

Open table in a new tab From the data obtained from the gene analysis (Table I) it was evident that only the α-type proteasome subunits were down-regulated significantly in HUVEC treated with BO-653 or probucol. To further assess the specificity of this response, we investigated changes in the β-type subunits (PMSB1 (HC5) and PMSB7 (Z)) in response to BO-653 and probucol by means of Northern and Western blotting. Neither subunit exhibited significant changes. The data of mRNA and protein levels for PMSB7 are shown after exposure to either BO-653 or probucol for 6 and 12 h, respectively (Fig.4, A and B). In addition, the effects of BO-653 and probucol on protein levels of PMSC6 (ATPase subunit of 19 S), PMSD1 (non-ATPase subunit of 19 S), and PMSE2 (PA28) were determined and found to be unchanged by treatment of cells with these antioxidants over a period of 12 h (Fig. 4,C, D, and E). These results are consistent with those of the gene chip experiment (Table I). These data support the hypothesis that both BO-653 and probucol show selectivity in modulating the expression of the α-type subunits. These data suggest that BO-653 and probucol have a functional impact on proteasome activity. We investigated this further by determining the accumulation of multiubiquitinated proteins and IκBα, well known target proteins of the proteasome. HUVECs were preincubated with the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide for 2 h, followed by additional incubation with or without either BO-653 or probucol to determine whether the stability of ubiquitinated proteins and IκBα was increased. Incubation of HUVEC with cycloheximide alone significantly decreased levels of both multiubiquitinated proteins and IκBα compared with non-treated cells (Fig. 5, lane 2 versus lane 1). This decrease is thought to be due to degradation of these proteins in the absence of new protein synthesis. In contrast, co-incubation of the cells with either BO-653 or probucol in the presence of cycloheximide maintained the levels of multiubiquitinated proteins and IκBα at control levels. (Fig. 5,lanes 3 and 4 versus lane 1). This increase is consistent with inhibition of degradation of these proteins by these antioxidants, but cannot be due to increased protein synthesis. Taken together these data provide a novel and interesting perspective on the biological properties of phenolic lipid peroxyl radical scavengers. The two compounds selected for study have both been shown to be anti-atherogenic in animal models, yet differ markedly in radical scavenging ability, with probucol being about 10 times less effective than BO-653 (4Gotoh N. Shimizu K. Komuro E. Tsuchiya J. Noguchi N. Niki E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1128: 147-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 14Cynshi O. Kawabe Y. Suzuki T. Takashima Y. Kaise H.

Biophys. 1997; 342: 236-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The unforeseen property revealed by genomic analysis was an apparent modulatory effect on the transcriptional regulation of subunits of the proteasome. Such an effect would be particularly significant in atherosclerosis, because nuclear factor κB (NFκB) expression is increased in human atherosclerotic lesions (31Mao S.J.T. Yates M.T. Jackson R.L. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 234: 505-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and is thought to make a significant contribution to the development of the inflammatory process. The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway degrades the inhibitory binding protein, IκBα, which ordinarily keeps NFκB sequestered in the cytoplasm. The degradation of IκBα by proteasomes allows nuclear translocation of NFκB in cells treated with various external stimuli including tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α. Inhibition of IκBα degradation by a proteasome inhibitor blocks NFκB activation. Accordingly, the expression of the endothelial cell adhesion molecules (ECAMs) such as vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and E-selectin induced by TNF-α (32Thurberg B.L. Collins T. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1998; 9: 387-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 33Kalogeris T.J. Kevil C.G. Laroux F.S. Coe L.L. Phifer T.J. Alexander J.S. Am. J.

It is generally accepted that these adhesion molecules play important roles in the development of atherosclerotic lesions (1Lusis A.J.

Atherosclerosis. 2001; 155: 123-130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Our findings provide the key elements for a molecular mechanism that contributes to the inhibition of VCAM-1 expression and contributes to the anti-atherosclerotic properties of phenolic antioxidants such as probucol and BO-653. With respect to the implications for the role of the proteasome in endothelial cell responses to atherosclerosis, these data are intriguing. Thus far most reports have focused on the biological importance of the 26 S proteasome that selectively degrades a multitude of ubiquitinated cellular proteins. In contrast, little is known of the direct role of the 20 S proteasome in regulating cellular processes. However, it was recently reported that interactions with the 20 S proteasome was a critical determinant in p21WAF1/CIP1turnover (35Morigi M. Angioletti S. Imberti B. Donadelli R. Micheletti G. Figliuzzi M. Remuzzi A. Zoja C. Remuzzi G. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1905-1915Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). The inhibitory effect of probucol and BO-653 on 20 S proteasome activity demonstrated herein is the first example of a pharmacological agent mediating its effects through this mechanism. The mechanisms by which these phenolic compounds regulate gene expression of proteasome subunits are not clear. Several possibilities exist with perhaps the most likely involving the effects on the cell signaling mediated by low level reactive oxygen and nitrogen species that are now known to control transcriptional events through activation of proteins such as the MAP kinases. If so then the effects of phenolic compounds may have some interesting implications for the role of low levels of lipid mediators acting as intermediaries in these cell signaling cascades. Interesting examples include 4-hydroxynonenal (36Parola M. Bellomo G. Robino G. Barrera G. Dianzani M, U. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 1999; 1: 255-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar) or acrolein as we have recently demonstrated in mouse embryo fibroblast cells (37Takabe W. Niki E. Uchida K. Yamada S. Satoh K. Noguchi N. Carcinogenesis. 2001; 22: 935-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Other possibilities include antioxidant independent mechanism in which these compounds may act as direct modulators of transcription factors or ligands for nuclear receptors. Current investigations are directed at analysis for the promoter for the proteasome subunits, which should reveal deeper insights into these interesting responses."

In transfection studies, deletion of exonic sequences downstream of the promoter resulted in reporter gene activity that was no longer neural cell-specific. When placed downstream of the GRIK5 promoter, a 77-bp sequence from the deleted fragment completely silenced reporter expression in NIH3T3 fibroblasts while attenuating activity in CG-4 cells. Analysis of the 77-bp sequence revealed a functional SP1-binding site and a sequence resembling a neuron-restrictive silencer element. The latter sequence, however, did not display cell-specific binding of REST-like proteins.

Two kainate receptor gene subfamilies encode the subunits GluR5–7 and KA1/2, which bind kainate and domoate with high affinity (2Hollman M. Heinemann S. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1994; 17: 31-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (3668) Google Scholar, 3Dingledine R. Borges K. Bowie D. Traynelis S.F. Pharmacol. Rev. 1999; 51: 7-61PubMed Google Scholar, 4Seeburg P.H.

When expressed in Xenopus oocytes or heterologous mammalian cells, only GluR5–7 form functional homomeric channels (5Bettler B. Boulter J. Hermans-Borgmeyer I. O'Shea-Greenfield A. Deneris E.S.

KA1 and KA2 are inactive as homomeric ion channels, but associate with members of the GluR5–7 family to form functional heteromeric kainate-preferring receptors with biophysical properties and agonist selectivity distinct from those of homomeric GluR5–7 channels (8Werner P. Voigt M. Keinanen K. Wisden W. Seeburg P.H. Nature. 1991; 351: 741-744Crossref Scopus (386) Google Scholar, 9Herb A. Burnashev N. Werner P. Sakmann B. Wisden W. Seeburg P.H.

Neuron. 1997; 19: 913-926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). In situ hybridization and immunohistochemical studies have demonstrated that, in different brain regions, specific combinations of members of the KA1/2 and GluR5–7 gene subfamilies are coexpressed (11Wisden W. Seeburg P.H. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 3582-3596Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Bahn S. Volk B. Wisden W. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 5525-5547Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Bischoff S. Barhanin J. Bettler B. Mulle C. Heinemann S. J. Comp. Neurol. 1997; 379: 541-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). This indicates that, similar to α-amino-3-hydroxymethylisoxazole-4-propionic acid and N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors, kainate receptor subunits assemble to form diverse subtypes of heteromeric channels. For example, co-immunoprecipitation experiments with anti-GluR6 and anti-KA2 antibodies have shown that these subunit proteins associate to form receptor channel complexes in brain cell membranes (14Wenthold R.J. Trumpy V.A. Zhu W.-S. Petralia R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1332-1339Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These molecular studies are consistent with the finding that functional homomeric and hetero-oligomeric kainate-preferring receptors are expressed in cultured neurons and glia (15Lerma J.

Despite the widespread expression of kainate receptor subunits in the mammalian nervous system, their function has remained elusive. Kainate receptor-mediated synaptic currents have been found in various areas of the central nervous system (18Castillo P.E. Malenka R.C. Nicoll R.A. Nature. 1997; 388: 182-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar, 19Vignes M. Collingridge G.I. Nature. 1997; 388: 179-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar, 20Frerking M. Malenka R.C.

Ballyk B.A. Hoo K.H. Mandelzys A. Pellizzari A. Bath C.P. Thomas J. Sharpe E.F. Davies C.H. Ornstein P.L. Schoepp D.D. Kamboj R.K. Collingridge G.L. Lodge D. Bleakman D.

Recently, however, some light has finally been shed on a role for kainate receptors at thalamocortical synapses by the work of Kidd and Isaac (29Kidd F.L. Isaac J.T.R. Nature. 1999; 400: 569-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), showing a decrease in kainate modulation of synaptic plasticity during development. The kainate receptor subunit KA2 is encoded by the GRIK5gene (30Szpirer C. Molne M. Antonacci R. Jenkins N.A. Finelli P. Sziperer J. Riviere M. Rocchi M. Gilbert D.J. Copeland N.G. Gallo V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11849-11853Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 31Huang F. Gallo V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8618-8627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). KA2 transcripts can be detected in the rat as early as embryonic day 10 (E10) in the neural tube (32Scherer S. Gallo V. J. Neurosci. Res. 1998; 52: 356-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and at E12 in the cortical plate (9Herb A. Burnashev N. Werner P. Sakmann B. Wisden W. Seeburg P.H. Neuron. 1992; 8: 775-785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that KA2 may play a developmental role prior to synapse formation (33Gallo V. Pende M. Scherer S. Molne M. Wright P. Neurochem. Res. 1995; 20: 549-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). At birth, the GRIK5 gene is expressed throughout the central nervous system, although its level of expression varies considerably between different brain areas and distinct cell types (11Wisden W. Seeburg P.H. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 3582-3596Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Bahn S. Volk B. Wisden W. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 5525-5547Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Since KA2 associates with other kainate receptor subunits, it follows that different functional receptor subtypes can be formed as a result of a stringent qualitative and quantitative control of GRIK5expression (34Sahara Y. Noro N. Iida Y. Soma K. Nakamura Y. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 6611-6620Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To gain an understanding of how kainate receptor subunit expression is regulated, we have previously cloned the GRIK5 gene and characterized its structure (31Huang F. Gallo V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8618-8627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). We have also identified an intronic element of this gene, which displays functional features of a silencer (31Huang F. Gallo V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8618-8627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). More recently, we described the binding of nuclear orphan receptor proteins to this sequence to down-regulate GRIK5transcription (35Chew L.-J. Huang F. Boutin J.-M. Gallo V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29366-29375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In this study, we analyzed the GRIK5 promoter and regulatory regions sufficient for tissue-specific transcription of the gene in both cultured cells and transgenic mice. We also found that GRIK5, like other glutamate receptor genes of the α-amino-3-hydroxymethylisoxazole-4-propionic acid and N-methyl-d-aspartate classes (36Myers S.J. Dingledine R. Borges K. Annu. Rev. Phrmacol. Toxicol. 1999; 39: 221-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), possesses a TATA-less and initiator (Inr)-containing promoter region that is GC-rich. This promoter is regulated by elements located within its first exon, and its selective expression in neural cells may involve a mechanism of preferential repression in non-neural cells. Restriction enzymes and DNA-modifying enzymes were from New England Biolabs Inc. (Beverly, MA). Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis-purified oligonucleotides were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Radionuclides were from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Large-scale plasmid DNA preparations were carried out using a QIAGEN Plasmid Maxi kit. All animal procedures were in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Animal Welfare Guidelines. CG-4, HeLa, and NIH3T3 cells were cultured as previously described (31Huang F. Gallo V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8618-8627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 37Louis J.C. Magal E. Muir D. Manthrope M. Varon S. J. Neurosci. Res. 1992; 31: 193-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). Cortical astrocytes were prepared as previously described (38McCarthy K.D. De Vellis J. J. Cell Biol. 1980; 85: 890-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (3398) Google Scholar, 39Gallo V. Armstrong R.C. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 394-406Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The isolation and characterization of GRIK5 genomic clones from a rat Sprague-Dawley genomic library (λDASH II; Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) have been described previously (31Huang F. Gallo V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8618-8627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The nucleotide sequence reported in this paper has been previously submitted to the GenBank™/EBI Data Bank with accession number U81010. The BamHI site in the 2-kb EcoRI-BamHI fragment defines the exon 1/intron 1 boundary (see Fig. 3 A). The GRIK5 2Kb-CAT construct was generated as previously described (31Huang F. Gallo V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8618-8627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). GRIK5-CAT deletion constructs were generated by restriction enzyme digestion and religation of GRIK52Kb-CAT (see Fig. 2). Apa5-CAT was generated by subcloning an 800-bp ApaI fragment from 2Kb-CAT into pLITMUS39 (New England Biolabs Inc.) to form pLITApa5 and subsequently inserting into pCATBasic (Promega, Madison WI) which will be subsequently referred to as Basic-CAT. Apa5A-, Apa5B-, Eag-, Sph-Apa-, and 2KbΔEag-CAT constructs were derived by digestion and religation of Apa5-CAT. Deletion constructs of Apa5A-CAT such as Apa5AΔSP1(a)Inr(a), Apa5AΔInr(a)(b), and Apa5AΔInr(b) were made by site-directed mutagenesis to generate appropriate restriction enzyme sites at the positions of Inr(a) (+1) and/or Inr(b) (+130) (see Fig. 3 Aand Table I). Apa5A-KCSE-CAT was formed by ligating a double-stranded oligonucleotide between the XbaI and XbaI sites of Apa5-CAT from which the XbaI-XbaI fragment had previously been removed.Table IOligonucleotides used for gel mobility shift assays and mutagenesisNameUseNucleotide sequenceInr(a)Gel shiftTCCCTGCCTCCCTCCCTTCATCTCTCCCCACCAInr(b)Gel shiftCCACAACCACCACCCTACCCACTCCCCInr(c)Gel shiftATCCTCTCCTCCCACCTCATCTCTCCACCTCGTmAMutagenesisGCCCGCCCTCCTCCCTGCCTGgagccCgTcgACTCTCCCCACCACCACCmBMutagenesisCACAACCACCACCCTAgatAtcaaCCCACCCCCCCGCGC600InrGel shiftGCCCTCCCCCACTTCCCCCGATGSP1(a)Gel shiftTCCTCCTGCCCGCCCTCCTCCCTGCCTConsensus SP1Gel shiftATTCGATCGGGGCGGGGCGAGCAP2Gel shiftGATCGAACTGACCGCCCGCGGCCCGCK(u)Gel shiftCTTTTCTCCACCCAGTCCTCACCCCCAGTGCCCCCCCCConsensus NRSEGel shiftCGCGCTGTCCGCGGTGCTGAAK(d)Gel shiftGGCCGGCCCGGCTAGGGGAGGGGGCGGGGGCCCmK(d)Gel shiftGGCCGGCCCGGCTAGGGGAaaaaataaGGGCCC62Gel shiftTCCTTTCTGTGGCCTCTGACCTTTCCTOne strand of each complementary pair is shown.

Transient transfections were performed in all cells in serum-free medium by lipofection (2 μl of LipofectAMINE/μg of DNA; Life Technologies, Inc.) as previously described (31Huang F. Gallo V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8618-8627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Cells were plated in 100-mm dishes, transfected with 10 μg of plasmid DNA for each GRIK5 construct, and cotransfected with 2 μg of pPolIIplacF.gal (Grant MacGregor, Emory University) to normalize for transfection efficiency. Cells were harvested 40 h after transfection, and cell extracts were prepared in 0.25 mTris buffer (pH 8.0) and assayed for CAT activity after heat inactivation of endogenous deacetylase for 10 min at 60 °C. CAT assays were carried out using n-butyryl-CoA as specified by the manufacturer (Promega). CAT activity results were obtained by liquid scintillation counting of xylene extracts. β-Galactosidase assays were performed as described by Nielsen et al. (40Nielsen D.A. Chou J. Mackrell A.J. Casadaban M.J. Steiner D.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 5198-5202Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). For all cell types, at least three independent transfection experiments were performed for each CAT construct. Statistical analysis was performed using Statview Version 5.0. Total RNA was prepared from tissues, CG-4 cells and astrocytes. Poly(A)+ RNAs were purified by an Oligotex kit (QIAGEN Inc.). RNA samples (2 μg/lane) were resolved by electrophoresis through a formaldehyde-containing 1% denaturing agarose gel, electrotransferred to Nytran membranes (Schleicher & Schüll), cross-linked to the membranes by UV irradiation (Stratalinker, Stratagene), and hybridized with a random-primed [α-32P]dCTP-labeled EcoRI-StuI KA2 cDNA fragment (595 bp). The specific activity of the probe was 108 cpm/μg of DNA. The blot was hybridized in 50% formamide at 42 °C and washed at high stringency with 0.1× SSC at 60 °C. To generate the pSP72Apa5A template plasmid, a HindIII-XbaI fragment from the subclone pLITApa5 was inserted into the corresponding sites of pSP72 (Promega). The insert was subsequently shortened at the 3′-end by digestion with EagI and EcoRI, filled in with Klenow enzyme, and religated. The template pSP72Apa5B was constructed by inserting an XbaI-StuI fragment from pLITApa5 into the SmaI and EcoRV sites of pSP72. Both templates were linearized with HindIII, and antisense [α-32P]UTP-labeled RNA probes were generated by transcription with T7 RNA polymerase (Maxiscript kit, Ambion Inc., Austin, TX). Total RNA was isolated by a single-step method using RNAzol (41Chomzynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Following gel purification of probes, RNase protection assays were performed with 30 μg of total RNA using the RPAIII kit from Ambion Inc. Hybridization was performed overnight at 55 °C. Reaction products were digested with a 1:100 dilution of RNase A/T1 mixture at 37 °C for 30 min, precipitated, and resolved on a 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gel alongside an M13 sequencing ladder. The ladder was generated with 35S-ATP using the −40 sequencing primer supplied with the U. S. Biochemical Corp. sequencing kit. Nuclear extracts from CG-4 cells were made and DNase I footprinting was performed as described by Huang and Gallo (31Huang F. Gallo V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8618-8627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) and Chew et al. (35Chew L.-J. Huang F. Boutin J.-M. Gallo V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29366-29375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Footprinting probes were generated by polymerase chain reaction and are shown in Fig. 8. The sequences of gel-shift probes, competitors, and mutagenic primers are given in TableI. For gel-shift assays, the probes were end-labeled by T4 polynucleotide kinase with [γ-32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and purified on Sephadex G-50 columns. The reactions were carried out in a total volume of 20 μl of binding buffer containing 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 60 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, and 50 ng/μl poly(dI-dC) or poly(dG-dC) for Inr competitions. The binding reactions were incubated on ice for 30 min with 6–15 μg of nuclear proteins. For experiments with recombinant TFIID (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), binding reactions containing up to 160 ng of protein were incubated at room temperature for 15 min in the absence of poly(dI-dC). Unlabeled competitors were mixed with probe prior to addition of binding protein(s). For antibody supershift assays, reactions were preincubated with specific antisera against SP1, SP3, SP4, AP2, TFIIB, and TFIID (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.) and YY1 (Geneka, Montreal, Canada) at room temperature for 30 min prior to addition of the probe. After adding 2 μl of 0.1% bromphenol blue loading dye, samples were loaded onto a 5% TGE (1× TGE: 0.05 m Tris, 0.4m glycine, and 0.002 m EDTA)- or 5% Tris borate/EDTA-polyacrylamide gel and electrophoresed at 100 V at 4 °C. The gels were then dried and autoradiographed. The 4.3-kb BamHI GRIK5 fragment was cloned upstream of the bacterial lacZ coding region (31Huang F. Gallo V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8618-8627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Following restriction digestion and purification from agarose gel, the DNA fragment containing 4.3-β-gal was purified by three consecutive ethanol precipitations, a chloroform extraction, and a final ethanol precipitation. The DNA was finally filtered through a Millex GV4 0.22-μm filter (Millipore Corp., Marlborough, MA) before microinjection into fertilized eggs and implantation into pseudo-pregnant foster mothers, after injected eggs developed into blastocysts (42Brinster R.L. Chen H.Y. Trumbauer M.E. Yagle M.K. Palmiter R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 471-487Crossref Scopus (784) Google Scholar). Putative founders were screened for transgene integration by both polymerase chain reaction and Southern blotting of genomic tail DNA. Two stable transgenic lines were obtained for 4.3-β-gal. Expression of the bacterial lacZ gene in transgenic mice was detected using the luminescence assay (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). Tissue homogenate was prepared by sonication in lysis solution containing 100 mmKHPO4, 0.2% Triton X-100, and 1 mmdithiothreitol. After centrifugation for 5 min, 25 μl of the supernatant was assayed by incubation with 200 μl of reaction buffer at room temperature for 60 min, and luminescence was measured in a luminometer according to the manufacturer’s instructions (CLONTECH). Luminescence was normalized to protein concentration in each sample. Histochemical staining was performed as follows. Mice were anesthetized and perfused transcardially with 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1m phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). Tissues were removed, immersed in the same fixative for 2 h at 4 °C, and stored in phosphate-buffered saline + 0.05% sodium azide. Tissue sections (100 μm) were cut using a Vibratome (Technical Products International Inc., St. Louis, MO). β-Galactosidase expression was analyzed by overnight incubation at 37 °C in X-gal staining solution (5 mm K3Fe(CN)6, 5 mmK4Fe(CN)6, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.02% Nonidet P-40, 0.01% sodium deoxycholate and 1 mg/ml X-gal). For whole embryo tissue sections, pregnant mice were perfused with phosphate-buffered saline, and the embryos (E15) were removed, immersion-fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), and stained as described above for brain tissue sections. After staining, frozen sections (100 μm) were then obtained on a freezing microtome (Microm International GmbH, Walldorf, Germany). In situhybridization protocols using 20- and 50-μm fresh frozen cryostat tissue sections were performed as described by Hayes and Loh (43Hayes W.P. Loh Y.P. Development. 1990; 110: 747-757PubMed Google Scholar) and Gallo et al. (44Gallo V. Upson L.M. Hayes W.P. Vyklicky L. Winters C.A. Buonanno A. J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 1010-1023Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The probe used was derived from the BamHI-SacI fragment (bp +452 to +1463) of KA2 cDNA (9Herb A. Burnashev N. Werner P. Sakmann B. Wisden W. Seeburg P.H. Neuron. 1992; 8: 775-785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar) inserted between the BamHI and SacI sites of pSP72. Antisense riboprobes were generated by in vitro transcription with T7 RNA polymerase following linearization of the template with HindIII. To delineate the genomic sequences responsible for tissue-specific GRIK5 expression in vivo, transgenic mouse lines were generated using 4.3 kb of 5′-flanking region. According to the numbering system used in this study (see Figs.2 and 3), this flanking region spans −3231 to +1100. Fusion genes were constructed that contained the promoter fragment and the bacterial lacZ coding region. Of 14 4.3-kb construct founders analyzed, two were found to carry the transgene by both polymerase chain reaction and Southern blotting of tail DNA (data not shown). These animals were bred to produce two independent lines, which displayed germ-line transmission of the transgene. In both lines, the pattern of β-galactosidase activity was clearly restricted to the central nervous system (Fig. 1 C) (data not shown), demonstrating that the 4.3-kb GRIK5 fragment containing the promoter is sufficient to direct expression to the rodent central nervous system. In addition, transgenic mice were also generated with the 2Kb-CAT and 4Kb-CAT constructs (31Huang F. Gallo V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8618-8627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) with very similar results (data not shown). Expression of the 4.3-β-gal transgene was analyzed in different areas of the mouse brain (Fig. 1, D–I) and compared with expression of endogenous KA2 transcripts (Fig. 1, A and B). The distribution of β-galactosidase activity detected in the embryonic brain at E16 was similar to that of the endogenous GRIK5 mRNAs (Fig. 1, A and D). Both transgenic lines showed similar transgene expression patterns. In the adult brain, high levels of β-galactosidase activity were found in areas with abundant GRIK5 mRNA (Fig. 1, compare B and E). The hippocampus (Fig. 1 H) and pyriform cortex (Fig. 1 I) were among the areas that displayed the highest levels of GRIK5 mRNA and β-galactosidase activity. A series of GRIK5 promoter constructs (31Huang F. Gallo V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8618-8627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) was assayed in cells of neural origin (central glia and CG-4 cells) and non-neural origin (NIH3T3 and HeLa cells). CG-4 cells are central glia with properties of oligodendrocyte progenitors and were shown to support high levels of GRIK5 promoter activity (31Huang F. Gallo V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8618-8627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 35Chew L.-J. Huang F. Boutin J.-M. Gallo V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29366-29375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). As reported previously (31Huang F. Gallo V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8618-8627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), CAT activity driven by 2 kb of the GRIK5promoter was significant in CG-4 cells and undetectable in NIH3T3 and HeLa cells (Fig. 2) (data not shown). Inclusion of an additional 2.3 kb of 5′-flanking sequence to generate a 4.3-kb construct did not significantly modify GRIK5 promoter activity (31Huang F. Gallo V. J. Biol.

Deletion analysis of 2Kb-CAT indicated that there is a negative regulatory element(s) between the EcoRI (−931) and ApaI (−112) sites and that the core promoter(s) lies within the 1200-bp fragment (Fig. 2). (Reference numbers assigned to restriction enzyme sites are based on physical mapping of the transcription initiation cluster shown in Fig. 3, with +1 indicating the start of the first exon.) A large ApaI deletion in the 2Kb-CAT construct (2KbΔApa5-CAT) completely abolished transcriptional activity (Fig. 2), thus providing evidence that minimal promoter sequences lie between −112 and +723. Indeed, this ApaI fragment (Apa5-CAT) was found to maintain cell type-specific transcriptional activity in CG-4 cells (Fig. 2). Interestingly, removal of sequences 3′ of XbaI from Apa5-CAT (Apa5A-CAT) resulted in a significant 2–3-fold increase in CAT activity compared with 1200-CAT, whereas the 3′-segment (Apa5B-CAT) was found to be inactive, demonstrating a core promoter element within Apa5A-CAT (−112 to +331) and repressor activity of Apa5B-CAT. Further analysis of these upstream sequences showed that sequences between −112 and +223 (Eag-CAT) could function as a minimal promoter (Fig. 2). In support of this observation, further 5′-deletion to the EagI site (2KbΔEag-CAT) dramatically attenuated activity. Importantly, the emergence of significant CAT activity in non-neural cells, NIH3T3 (Fig. 2) and HeLa (data not shown), with Apa5A-CAT, Apa-Sph-CAT, and Eag-CAT supports the notion that transcription could initiate within the EagI fragment, and neural cell specificity was determined by sequences located downstream of SphI (+503) (Fig. 2).

However, reduced stability or expression levels pose a major problem with many engineered antibodies. As a model for understanding functional consequences of variable region mutation, we have studied the assembly and trafficking of anti-phenylphosphocholine antibodies. Previously, we identified severe secretion defects because of mutations in the heavy chain second complementarity determining region, which is involved in antigen binding. Here we demonstrate that immunoglobulin secretion is increased up to 27-fold by incubating stably transfected PCG1–1 cells with cognate hapten p-nitrophenylphosphocholine. Secretion was unaffected by nonbinding analogs. Radiotracer and metabolic labeling experiments demonstrated specific cellular uptake ofp-nitrophenylphosphocholine and increased intracellular heavy and light chain assembly. Brefeldin A inhibited hapten-mediated immunoglobulin secretion but not assembly, indicating that assembly occurs early within the biosynthetic pathway. Recovery of secretion correlated with antigen binding capacity, suggesting that the rescue mechanism involves stabilization of heavy and light chain variable domains. This model system provides the first demonstration that cognate ligands can increase intracellular assembly of functional anti-hapten antibody within mammalian cells and suggests that small molecules of appropriate specificity and affinity acting as chemical chaperones may find application for increasing or regulating immunoglobulin expression.

Previously, we demonstrated that 16 mutants in the H chain framework region 2 and CDR2 region of the T15 and PCG1–1 anti-phenylphosphocholine antibodies have severe defects in secretion (6Chen C.

Immunol. 1997; 159: 1293-1302PubMed Google Scholar). The molecular basis of the secretion defect in several mutants was traced to a single substitution (Ile51 to Arg or Lys) in the H chain of the PCG1–1 antibody (8Wiens G.D. Lekkerkerker A. Veltman I. Rittenberg M.B. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 2179-2186Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Mutant H chains co-immunoprecipitate with chaperones BiP and GRP94 and remain endoglycosidase H-sensitive, consistent with retention in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Mutant H chains rapidly assemble into intracellular H2 intermediates but exhibit impaired L chain association and undergo intracellular degradation (8Wiens G.D. Lekkerkerker A. Veltman I. Rittenberg M.B. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 2179-2186Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been demonstrated that defective maturation of mutant proteins from the ER can be partially or fully corrected by incubation with low molecular weight compounds termed chemical chaperones (9Tatzelt J.

High concentrations of chemical chaperones, often in the millimolar range, are generally required to reverse trafficking defects. The mechanism(s) by which chemical chaperones function are not fully understood but are thought to include stabilization of improperly folded proteins (10Sato S. Ward C.L. Krouse M.E. Wine J.J.

Chem. 1999; 274: 12883-12889Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Chemical chaperones such as glycerol and trimethylamine N-oxide appear to be nonspecific as they are able to rescue diverse types of proteins (16Brown C.R. Hong-Brown L.Q. Welch W.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 1432-1444Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), whereas other chemical chaperones only function with a narrower set of proteins (13Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 709-712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 17Fan J.Q. Ishii S. Asano N. Suzuki Y. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 112-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar). Until now chemical chaperones have not been shown to restore secretion of heteropolymers such as Ig. Here we used anti-phenyphosphocholine antibodies as a model system to determine whether a defect in Ig secretion could be corrected by the use of the cognate hapten ligand acting as a chemical chaperone. Incubation of stable transfectants with the cognate hapten,p-nitrophenylphosphocholine (NPPC), led to rescue of secretion in five of six low secreting PCG1–1 mutants. NPPC was specifically taken up by cells and resulted in increased intracellular heavy and light chain assembly. In contrast, NPPC did not affect the amount of secretion of wild type (WT) Ig nor did it nonspecifically induce the release of incompletely assembled Ig chains, indicating that the interaction is highly specific. The capacity of trafficking-impaired Ig to bind antigen correlated with ligand-mediated rescue of secretion. These data indicate that the mechanism of rescue involves the intracellular stabilization of VH-VL pairing. Hapten ligands may find application for regulating or increasing assembly and secretion of anti-hapten Ig from hybridomas. The PCG1–1 heavy chain loss variant (PCG1–1 H−), and cell culture conditions were described previously (7Wiens G.D. Heldwein K.A. Stenzel-Poore M.P. Rittenberg M.B. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 1293-1302PubMed Google Scholar). For antibody purification, cells were cultured in HyQ-CCM1 serum-free medium (HyClone Laboratories, Logan, UT) for 4 days in the presence of 5 mmp-nitrophenylphosphocholine (NPPC). Antibody was purified from sterile filtered supernatants using protein A-Sepharose. Stable transfectants were plated in triplicate at 1 × 106 cells ml−1 of tissue culture medium in a 12-well plate. After designated incubation periods, culture supernatants and cell lysates were collected as described (6Chen C. Martin T.M. Stevens S. Rittenberg M.B. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 577-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Haptens NPPC andp-aminophenylphosphocholine (APPC) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich and dissolved in tissue culture medium prior to use. Phosphocholine (PC, Sigma-Aldrich) was dissolved in 0.1m EDTA (pH 8.0) and diluted 1:10 in 0.1 msodium phosphate buffer (pH 8.0). The solution was adjusted to pH 8.0 with 1 m KOH, precipitated salt was removed by centrifugation, and supernatant stored at −20 °C. All reagents were from Sigma-Aldrich except [methyl-3H]choline chloride (specific activity = 75.00 Ci mmol−1), which was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. The procedure for the synthesis of [3H]NPPC was based on a modification of the method of Chesebro et al. (18Chesebro B. Metzger H. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 766-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar) for the synthesis ofp-nitrophenyl-3-N,N,N-trimethylpropylammonium phosphate, as described by Moulton (19Moulton H.M. Environmental Sciences and Resources: ChemistryPh.D. thesis. Portland State University, Portland, OR1996Google Scholar). Ethanol solutions of unlabeled choline chloride (0.32 mmol) and [methyl-3H]choline chloride (800 µCi) were combined and evaporated to dryness (final specific activity = 2.5 mCi mmol−1). In a separate tube,p-nitrophenylphosphorodichloridate (0.35 mmol) and quinoline (101 µl; 0.85 mmol) were dissolved in dry CH3CN (372 µl) and mixed with radiolabeled choline on ice. The tube containing the reaction mixture was rotated end-over-end at 4 °C for 8 h. Pyridine (300 µl) and H2O (50 µl) were then added, and the solution was agitated at 25 °C for 30 min. Solvent was removed, and the resulting oil was dissolved in H2O (1.0 ml), then passed through a TMD-8 mixed bed ion exchange column (2 cm × 12 cm) with H2O as the elution solvent. The first 45 ml of flow-through was lyophilized, yielding [3H]NPPC as a white solid (0.11 mmol; 2.5 mCi mmol−1; 34% isolated yield). The product was analyzed by cellulose thin layer chromatography (isopropanol/ammonium hydroxide/water, 7:2:1 (v/v/v);RF = 0.56 for NPPC). Product obtained from a side-by-side synthesis in which the radiolabeled choline chloride was replaced by the unlabeled choline was examined by 1H NMR,13C NMR, and 31P NMR. Each NMR spectrum was identical to the corresponding spectrum of authentic NPPC. The final [3H]NPPC was tested alongside authentic NPPC in an inhibition ELISA and 24-h secretion assay and found to be indistinguishable from the unlabeled hapten. Transfected cells were cultured and labeled with 150 µCi of [35S]Express protein labeling mix for 20 min as described (20Martin T.M. Wiens G.D. Rittenberg M.B. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 5963-5970PubMed Google Scholar) either in the presence or absence of NPPC. Unincorporated label was removed by washing cells two times and resuspending in complete tissue culture medium containing Met/Cys for the indicated chase time periods. Ig was immunoprecipitated from clarified cell lysates or supernatants by incubation with protein A-Sepharose CL-4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For assembly experiments the immunoprecipitates were washed with buffers as described previously (20Martin T.M. Wiens G.D. Rittenberg M.B. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 5963-5970PubMed Google Scholar). All labeling experiments were quantified using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA) and IP lab gel software (version 1.5; Analytics, Vienna, VA). In some experiments, cells were cultured in 5 µg ml−1 brefeldin A (BFA; Sigma) to block secretion. Cells were treated for 1 h with brefeldin A prior to pulse labeling and during chase time points. The concentration of Ig proteins in supernatants and cell lysates was determined by sandwich ELISA as described previously (7Wiens G.D. Heldwein K.A. Stenzel-Poore M.P. Rittenberg M.B. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 1293-1302PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, to determine H+L in the supernatant or lysate, ELISA plates were coated with rabbit anti-mouse IgG2b(Zymed Laboratories Inc., San Francisco, CA), and the amount of bound Ig from the lysate or supernatant was determined by a secondary alkaline phosphatase-conjugated, goat anti-mouse κ antibody (Southern Biotechnology Associates, Birmingham, AL). All antisera were used at a 1:1000 dilution. Standard curves were generated using affinity-purified antibody from WT transfectant PCG1–1 (γ2b, κ) or hybridoma PCG2b-2 (γ2b, κ). Antibody binding to PC-histone was determined by a direct ELISA as described previously (7Wiens G.D. Heldwein K.A. Stenzel-Poore M.P. Rittenberg M.B. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 1293-1302PubMed Google Scholar). Trypsinized cells were washed twice and resusupended in tissue culture medium containing 20% fetal bovine serum, then allowed to adhere to 12-well tissue culture plates. For dose-response experiments, 1.0 × 106cells were plated, whereas 0.8 × 106 cells were used for the time-course and inhibition experiments. In all experiments, after 12 h of incubation, nonadherent cells were removed with four washes of 1 ml of serum-free CCM-1 medium (HyClone) and dilutions of [3H]NPPC were added to cells in 0.5 ml of CCM-1 medium. As a negative control, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde solution in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) for 15 min prior to the addition of labeled hapten. For the dose-response and inhibition experiments, cells were incubated for an additional 14 h at 37 °C prior to harvest. At harvest, free [3H]NPPC was removed by washing cells four times with 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline, and cells were solubilized in 0.5 ml of 0.5% SDS in 0.2m NaOH solution as described (21Rajan D.P. Huang W. Kekuda R. George R.L. Wang J. Conway S.J. Devoe L.D. Leibach F.H. Prasad P.D. Ganapathy V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14331-14335Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Lysates were transferred to vials, diluted in 10 ml of ScintiVerse (Fisher Scientific, Fair Lawn, NJ), and the radioactivity associated with the cells was quantified by liquid scintillation counting (Beckman model LS 3801). Previously we proposed that VH mutations may impair Ig assembly and/or destabilize the H-L complex (20Martin T.M. Wiens G.D. Rittenberg M.B. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 5963-5970PubMed Google Scholar). A single mutation at position 51 appears sufficient to prevent stable H-L complex formation; we predicted that compounds stabilizing H-L interaction should increase secretion of this antibody. Because ligand binding can stabilize recombinant VH-VL pairing in vitro (22Ueda H. Tsumoto K. Kubota K. Suzuki E. Nagamune T. Nishimura H. Schueler P.A. Winter G. Kumagai I. Mohoney W.C. Nat. Biotechnol. 1996; 14: 1714-1718Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 23Jager M. Pluckthun A. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 2005-2019Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), we tested whether addition of the hapten NPPC (5 mm) to cultured cells would increase the secretion of Ig into the surrounding medium. Incubation of PCG1–1 Ile51 → Arg transfectant cells in NPPC significantly increased the amount of Ig in culture supernatant as determined by ELISA (15-fold ± 3 (mean ± S.E.); n = 7 independent experiments, TableI). Similar results were obtained with three independently created PCG1–1 Ile51 → Arg transfectants, indicating this is not a transfectant-specific effect (Data not shown). The addition of NPPC also augmented secretion of another Ile51 single-site secretion mutant, PCG1–1 Ile51 → Lys (9-fold ± 3; n = 4 independent experiments). The increase of Ig in the supernatant was dose-dependent, and the effect was specific to NPPC (Fig.1A). Addition of the structurally related hapten PC, which does not bind to PCG1–1 WT antibody, did not increase the amount of Ig in culture supernatants. Similarly, the addition of 5 mm choline or 0.05 mmp-nitrophenol had no effect on secretion (data not shown). The addition of 5 mm APPC resulted in a modest, 2.4-fold increase in secretion. APPC binds with ∼12-fold lower affinity as compared with NPPC (24Bruderer U. Stenzel-Poore M.P. Bachinger H.P. Fellman J.H. Rittenberg M.B. Mol. Immunol. 1989; 26: 63-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), suggesting that binding affinity may correlate with efficiency of rescue. Increased supernatant Ig could not be attributed to toxicity as cell viability was greater than 95% in medium alone or medium with NPPC (Fig. 1B). To examine whether the hapten nonspecifically increased Ig chain secretion, the secretion of PCG1–1 L chains was measured as a control as it is produced in excess over transfected H chains (7Wiens G.D. Heldwein K.A. Stenzel-Poore M.P. Rittenberg M.B. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 1293-1302PubMed Google Scholar). NPPC addition did not increase free PCG1–1 L chain secretion (Fig.1C). Furthermore, NPPC did not increase secretion of H2L2 from WT PCG1–1 or T15 cells (data not shown).Table IImmunoglobulin concentration in culture supernatants or cell lysates after incubation in the presence or absence of 5 mm NPPCCell lineSampleELISA assay1-aStable transfectants were cultured for 24 h, and the concentrations of secreted and intracellular immunoglobulin chains were determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Data are expressed as an average ± standard error of triplicate cultures from one experiment.

Open table in a new tab Although NPPC did not affect the amount of secretion of WT Ig, the presence of this compound might nonspecifically induce the release of intracellularly retained, incompletely assembled Ig chains. This possibility was tested in two ways. First, we incubated NPPC with stable transfectant cell lines that only express either the T15 H chain or the T15 L chain (Vκ22 gene). We have previously demonstrated that both the T15 H chain and the T15 L chain, when expressed alone, are retained in the ER and that the T15 L chain is degraded via a proteasome-dependent pathway (25O'Hare T. Wiens G.D. Whitcomb E.A. Enns C.A. Rittenberg M.B. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 11-14PubMed Google Scholar). The addition of 5 mm NPPC did not increase the amount of either T15 H chain or T15 L chain in supernatants, as measured by ELISA (Table I). These data indicate that NPPC does not nonspecifically disrupt the retention of unassembled Ig H or L chains in transfected cells. The presence of NPPC also did not alter the steady state balance between synthesis and degradation of the nonsecreted T15 H and T15 L chain (data not shown) or the intracellular amount of the mutant PCG1–1 H chain (Table I). Second, we examined the binding activity of Ig secreted in the presence of hapten (Fig. 1D). If NPPC increased secretion of partially assembled or nonfunctional antibody, then antigen binding activity would be reduced. However, protein A-purified WT and mutant antibody exhibited similar binding activity for PC protein, indicating that functional antibody was secreted into supernatant. Thus, these data indicate that NPPC increases the amount of mutant Ig in the supernatant and this secreted Ig is stable with respect to antigen binding. Because NPPC would not be expected to enter cells passively, we tested its capacity to be taken up by cells in culture. Specific uptake of [3H]NPPC was determined by incubation with viable cells, whereas nonspecific uptake was determined by incubation with paraformaldehyde inactivated cells. Results of uptake assays indicate [3H]NPPC is taken up in a dose-dependent manner by stably transfected PCG1–1 cells (Fig. 2A). Uptake was not unique to PCG1–1 Ile51 → Arg transfectants, as the parental cell line PCG1–1 H- and T15 H-expressing cells also incorporated [3H]NPPC over 14 h (data not shown). Uptake was inhibited by excess nonradiolabeled NPPC (Fig.2B) and choline (data not shown), indicating that the uptake was specific and not the result of passive diffusion. Although not formally demonstrated, these data suggest that NPPC may be taken up by a mechanism similar to that of choline. Choline is known to be taken up by lymphocytes (26Sauers L.J. Wierda D. Walker E.R. Reasor M.J. J. Immunopharmacol. 1986; 8: 611-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) and transported into neurons via a choline transporter (27Okuda T. Haga T. Kanai Y. Endou H. Ishihara T. Katsura I. Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3: 120-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 28Okuda T. Haga T. FEBS Lett. 2000; 484: 92-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Measurement of NPPC uptake in cells cultured with 1 mm [3H]NPPC demonstrated a linear rate of 60 pmol h−1/106 cells over 24 h (Fig.2C, inset). In comparison, [3H]choline is taken up by PCG1–1 Ile51 → Arg cells at a rate approximately 1–2 orders of magnitude faster than NPPC (data not shown), indicating that differences between choline and NPPC uptake exist. Assuming a transport-mediated process, the apparentKm of NPPC uptake calculated from the inhibition experiments was 14.5 ± 0.7 mm. Because uptake of [3H]NPPC is via a slow, low affinity process, we examined whether the time course of uptake paralleled the biological activity of Ig secretion rescue (Fig. 2D). A 4-fold increase in Ig was detected in supernatant by 4 h, whereas a 27-fold increase was detected by 10 h. These results demonstrate that, after a delay, increased secretion parallels the uptake of labeled NPPC. Because NPPC is taken up by PCG1–1 cells, we investigated whether rescue of secretion occurred via increased intracellular assembly and whether the secreted Ig consisted of fully assembled H2L2heterodimers. The kinetics and pathway of assembly were examined by subjecting cells to [35S]Met/Cys-labeled pulse-chase analysis either in the presence or absence of 5 mm NPPC. Heavy chains were immunoprecipitated with protein A-Sepharose and separated by nonreducing SDS-PAGE. Ig assembly was followed at 0-, 2-, and 10-h time points after a 20-min pulse. In the absence of NPPC, the majority of the single Ile51 → Arg H chain was arrested at the H2 step in Ig assembly (Fig.3A). As expected, secretion-impaired mutant H chains co-immunoprecipitated with BiP (29Haas I.G. Wabl M. Nature. 1983; 306: 387-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar,30Bole D.G. Hendershot L.M. Kearney J.F. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 1558-1566Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). A small amount of intracellular H2L was formed at 0 and 2 h, and then levels decreased by 10 h. In contrast, assembly of H2L2 in WT cells was essentially complete by 2 h and co-immunoprecipitated BiP was not detectable (Fig. 3C). In agreement with ELISA data (Table I), a small amount of the mutant Ig was visible in the supernatant at the 2- and 10-h chase time points in the absence of NPPC (Fig. 3A). The small amount of secreted mutant Ig was fully assembled H2L2, as judged by two-dimensional electrophoresis (data not shown). The addition of NPPC markedly increased the amount of H2L2 in the mutant supernatant. By 2 h there was a 2.2-fold increase in fully assembled Ig, and by 10 h there was a 6.4-fold increase in supernatant Ig (Fig. 3B). Importantly, NPPC stimulated an increase in the amount of intracellular H2L in the Ile51 → Arg transfectant, indicating an intracellular mechanism of rescue. The relative amount of H2L assembly intermediate was increased by 1.7-fold at 2 h and 2.9-fold at 10 h in comparison to control cultures. In agreement with ELISA data, the effect was specific to the mutated antibody, as NPPC did not increase secretion of WT antibody nor was there an increase in WT assembly intermediates (Fig. 3D). To independently confirm that NPPC augments intracellular assembly, we inhibited secretion by preincubation with brefeldin A (Fig.4A). In the presence of BFA, NPPC caused a modest increase in intracellular H2L (2.0-fold) and a substantial increase (4.1-fold) in H2L2 by 10 h (Fig. 4C). The formation of H2 was not altered by the presence of the hapten and BFA, indicating that increased assembly is targeted to H and L chain assembly. These data indicate that assembly occurs early within the biosynthetic pathway. No H2L2 was detected in the supernatant, indicating that secretion was completely blocked by BFA treatment (Fig. 4A). This was independently confirmed by a subsequent immunoprecipitation of free supernatant L chain (2-h chase time point) from either BFA-treated or vehicle (methanol)-treated PCG1–1 Ile51 → Arg culture supernatants (Fig.4B). The addition of BFA completely blocked L chain secretion at both the 2-h (Fig. 4B) and 10-h chase time points (data not shown). PCG1–1 L chains are secreted as both apparent monomers and covalent dimers similar to other murine L chains (31Dul J.L. Aviel S. Melnick J. Argon Y. J.

As observed for the WT antibody, NPPC had no effect on L chain secretion or on the assembly of L chain into covalent dimers (Fig.4B, data not shown). Taken together, these data indicate that NPPC specifically rescues secretion of the mutant Ig by increasing intracellular H2 → H2L and H2L → H2L2 assembly early within the biosynthetic pathway, presumably in the ER.Figure 4Hapten-mediated intracellular assembly occurs in the presence of brefeldin A. In the presence of brefeldin A, no Ig or L chain is secreted into the supernatant, but the addition of NPPC causes the assembly of H2L2, which is detectable in the lysate. A, cells stably transfected with Ile51 → Arg H chains were cultured in the presence of brefeldin A 1 h prior to a 20-min 35S pulse label, followed by cold chase either in the absence (−NPPC) or presence of 5 mm NPPC (+NPPC) for 0, 2, and 10 h. H chains were immmunoprecipitated and separated using electrophoretic conditions described in Fig. 3. B, supernatants from control or BFA-treated Ile51 → Arg cells were re-immunoprecipitated for κ light chain. Secreted L chain resolves under nonreducing conditions as a covalent dimer and monomer. Data shown are representative of three experiments. C, densitometry of H2, H2L, and H2L2 present in the lysate at 10-h chase time point. -Fold increase caused by NPPC treatment (black bars; + NPPC) was determined by standardization to control (white bars; − NPPC). The amount of H2L2 is increased significantly (Student's t test; p = 0.016).
