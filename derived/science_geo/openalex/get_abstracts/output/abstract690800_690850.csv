https://openalex.org/W4220747412,"All cereal crops, particularly rice are perpetually affected due to drastic climatic changes which triggers different stressors resulting in food shortage scenarios across the globe. In modern era, application of nanotechnology holds the pledge in combating the climate change mediated environmental stressors through nanomaterials such as pesticides, nano-biosensors, nano-clays and nano-seed priming technologies. Current study is a part of experiment conducted to comprehend the behaviour of rice plants raised from Zinc Oxide nanoparticles (ZnONPs) primed seeds under the water shortage environment. The seed priming treatment concentrations included 0, 5, 10, 15, 25 and 50 ppm. In the experimental results an increase in plant height, total chlorophyll contents, plant fresh and dry weights was obtained by use of seed priming with ZnONPs. The study results proved that seed priming with 25ppm of ZnONPs increased seed and straw yield with value of 85.333 and 123.333, respectively under water deficit environment. The analysis depicted that 25 ppm has been found more suitable for increasing the 1000 paddy weight of rice plants under both well irrigated and water shortage conditions. Seed priming with ZnONPs results in 53% reduction in MDA contents of water stressed rice plants Drought stress leads to reduction in plant height by 31%, plant fresh weight by 22% and plant dry weight by 28%. Seed priming treatments imparted in current study show significance increase in plant biomass. Priming with ZnONPs further enhances the levels of proline amino acid facilitating the plant to combat water shortage stress. A further elevation in activities of SOD, CAT and POD takes place in rice plants raised from ZnONPs primed seeds by 11%, 13% and 38%, respectively. An elevation in activities of antioxidant enzymes was found and the levels of oxidative stress indicators decreased upon seed priming with ZnONPs. Furthermore the yield characteristics such as panicle length, number of tillers, paddy yield and straw yield of the rice plants raised through ZnONPs primed seeds enhanced. The ZnONPs at concentration of 25 ppm proved optimum in alleviating drought induced damages. It can be inferred that seed pre conditioning with ZnONPs is helpful in increasing yield attributes under the water shortage environment."
https://openalex.org/W4220767325,"The current worldwide COVID-19 pandemic has elicited widespread concerns and stress. Arguably, healthcare workers are especially vulnerable to experience burnout during these times due to the nature of their work. Indeed, high prevalence of burnout was found among healthcare workers during the outbreak. However, the individual differences predicting burnout among healthcare workers during the pandemic have been understudied. The aim of the current study was, therefore, to identify risk and protective factors contributing to the severity of burnout among healthcare workers, above and beyond levels of current psychological distress. The survey was distributed online during the period April 13-28, 2020, approximately two months after the first COVID-19 case was identified in Israel. Ninety-eight healthcare workers completed an online survey administered cross-sectionally via the Qualtrics platform that included questionnaires assessing habitual emotion regulation strategies (i.e., trait worry, reappraisal, and suppression), psychological distress, COVID-19 related concerns, and burnout. A hierarchical linear regression analysis revealed that only trait worry and psychological distress were significant predictors of job burnout among healthcare workers. These findings highlight the role of maladaptive emotion regulation tendencies, specifically trait worry, in job burnout among healthcare workers. These findings have implications for both the assessment and treatment of healthcare workers. We discuss potential mechanisms and implications for practice."
https://openalex.org/W4220881656,"This research sought to ascertain the relationship between hematocrit (HCT) and mortality in patients with sepsis. Methods: A retrospective analysis was conducted on the clinical data of septic patients who were hospitalized between 2008 and 2019 in an advanced academic medical center in Boston, Massachusetts, registered in the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database, We analyzed basic information including gender, age, race, and types of the first admission, laboratory indicators including HCT, platelets, white blood cells, albumin, bilirubin, hemoglobin, and serum creatinine, and 30-day mortality. A Cox proportional hazards regression model was utilized to analyze the relationship between HCT and 30-day mortality in patients with sepsis. Results: This research recruited 2057 patients who met the research requirements from 2008 to 2019. According to the HCT level, it was classified into the low HCT level, the regular HCT level, and the high HCT level. The 30-day mortality rate was 62.6%, 27.5%, and 9.9% for patients with the low HCT level, the regular HCT level, and the high HCT level, respectively ( p &lt; 0.05). The multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression model analysis displayed that compared with patients with the regular HCT level, the 30-day mortality of patients with the low HCT level increased by 58.9% (hazard ratio = 1.589, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.009–2.979, p &lt; 0.05). Conclusion: The low HCT level is an independent risk factor for the increase of the 30-day mortality in patients with sepsis and can be used as a significant predictor of the clinical outcome of sepsis."
https://openalex.org/W4221001036,"The ability of microorganisms to generate resistance outcompetes with the generation of new and efficient antibiotics. Therefore, it is critically required to develop novel antibiotic agents and treatments to control bacterial infections. Green synthesized metallic and metal oxide nanoparticles are considered as the potential means to target bacteria as an alternative to antibiotics. Nanoconjugates have also attracted attention because of their increased biological activity as compared to free antibiotics. In the present investigation, silver nanoparticles (AgNPs), zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO NPs), copper oxide nanoparticles (CuO NPs), and iron oxide nanoparticles (FeO NPs) have been synthesized by using leaf extract of Ricinus communis . Characterization of nanoparticles was done by using UV–Vis Spectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy, Scanning Electron Microscopy, Energy Dispersive X-Ray Analyzer, X-ray Diffraction Analysis, and Dynamic Light Scattering Particle Size Analyzer. Interestingly, Streptomycin when combined with AgNPs, ZnO NPs, CuO NPs, and FeO NPs showed enhanced antibacterial activity against clinical isolates of S . aureus which suggested synergism between the nanoparticles and antibiotics. The highest enhanced antibacterial potential of Streptomycin was observed in conjugation with ZnO NPs (11 ± 0.5 mm) against S . aureus . Minimum inhibitory concentration of conjugates of AgNPs, ZnO NPs, CuO NPs, and FeO NPs with streptomycin against S . aureus was found to be 3.12, 2.5,10, and 12.5 μg/mL respectively. The considerable point of the present investigation is that S . aureus , which was resistant to streptomycin becomes highly susceptible to the same antibiotic when combined with nanoparticles. This particular observation opens up windows to mitigate the current crisis due to antibiotic resistance to combat antimicrobial infections efficiently."
https://openalex.org/W4221063569,"During a crisis, society calls for individuals to take prosocial actions that promote crisis management. Indeed, individuals show higher willingness to help after a disaster. However, the COVID-19 pandemic presents significant differences as it is an ongoing crisis that affects all individuals and has the potential to pose a direct health threat to anyone. Therefore, we propose that the pandemic may also negatively affect willingness to help, specifically blood donation intentions. It requires a high level of willingness to donate blood beyond the crisis outbreak, as more blood will be needed when postponed surgeries resume. When comparing blood donation intentions from a pre-pandemic study to results from a six-wave (bi-weekly) panel study conducted in Germany during the first pandemic phase (April to June 2020), we find lower medium and long-term blood donation intentions. While active donors show increased awareness of ability and eligibility to donate at the beginning of the pandemic compared to pre-pandemic, they feel significantly less able to donate as the pandemic progresses. Furthermore, inactive donors' perceived ability to donate significantly decreases in the pandemic phase compared to the pre-pandemic phase. Crucially, both active and inactive donors feel less responsible and less morally obliged to donate, resulting in an overall negative pandemic effect on blood donation intentions. The COVID-19 pandemic compromises blood donations endangering the life-saving blood supply. These alarming results offer evidence-based grounds for practical implications for driving donations in the event of a pandemic."
https://openalex.org/W4221028366,"Coronaviruses (CoVs) are positive-stranded RNA viruses with short clubs on their edges. CoVs are pathogenic viruses that infect several animals and plant organisms, as well as humans (lethal respiratory dysfunctions). A noval strain of CoV has been reported and named as SARS-CoV-2. Numerous COVID-19 cases were being reported all over the World. COVID-19 and has a high mortality rate. In the present study, immunoinformatics techniques were utilized to predict the antigenic epitopes against 3C like protein. B-cell epitopes and Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) were designed computationally against SARS-CoV-2. Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA) of seven complete strains (HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2) was performed to elucidate the binding domain and interacting residues. MHC-I binding epitopes were evaluated by analyzing the binding affinity of the top-ranked peptides having HLA molecule. By utilizing the docked complexes of CTL epitopes with antigenic sites, the binding relationship and affinity of top-ranked predicted peptides with the MHC-I HLA protein were investigated. The molecular docking analyses were conducted on the ZINC database library and twelve compounds having least binding energy were scrutinized. In conclusion, twelve CTL epitopes (GTDLEGNFY, TVNVLAWLY, GSVGFNIDY, SEDMLNPNY, LSQTGIAV, VLDMCASLK, LTQDHVDIL, TTLNDFNLV, CTSEDMLNP, TTITVNVLA, YNGSPSGVY, and SMQNCVLKL) were identified against SARS-CoV-2."
https://openalex.org/W4221056582,"The Yellow River Basin (YRB) is China's substantial energy consumption base. The issue of carbon emission efficiency directly affects the ecological protection and high-quality development of the YRB. It is the key to achieving carbon peak in 2030 and carbon neutralization in 2060 (""30.60"") double carbon emission reduction targets. Therefore, taking YRB as the research object, this paper first calculates the carbon emission and the decoupling state in the YRB. Secondly, the super-efficiency slacks-based measurement (SE-SBM) model is combined with the Malmquist index to analyze the temporal and spatial evolution characteristics of YRB's carbon emission efficiency from static and dynamic perspectives. Thirdly, the dynamic evolution characteristics of carbon emission efficiency are analyzed with the help of the Kernel density function. Finally, the Tobit model analyzes the influencing factors of YRB's and China's carbon emission efficiency. The results show that: (1) Among the nine provinces of YRB, the decoupling state between carbon emissions and economic growth in most provinces changes from weak decoupling to strong decoupling, and the decoupling elasticity index shows a fluctuating downward trend. (2) There are significant differences in carbon emission efficiency among provinces, but on the whole, it shows a stable growth trend. The high-value area of carbon emission efficiency is increasing, and the phenomenon of two-level differentiation is improving. The decline of the technological progress index causes the Malmquist index in Qinghai and Ningxia. On the contrary, the rise of the Malmquist index in the other seven provinces is caused by improving the technical efficiency index. (3) Industrial structure, economic development, and industrialization are the main positive factors affecting YRB's carbon emission efficiency. Urbanization level, green development level, and energy consumption level are the leading negative indicators hindering YRB's improvement of carbon emission efficiency. Therefore, targeted emission reduction suggestions should be formulated according to YRB's resource endowment and development stage characteristics."
https://openalex.org/W4221072447,"Numerous human conditions are associated with the microbiome, yet studies are inconsistent as to the magnitude of the associations and the bacteria involved, likely reflecting insufficiently employed sample sizes. Here, we collected diverse phenotypes and gut microbiota from 34,057 individuals from Israel and the U.S.. Analyzing these data using a much-expanded microbial genomes set, we derive an atlas of robust and numerous unreported associations between bacteria and physiological human traits, which we show to replicate in cohorts from both continents. Using machine learning models trained on microbiome data, we show prediction accuracy of human traits across two continents. Subsampling our cohort to smaller cohort sizes yielded highly variable models and thus sensitivity to the selected cohort, underscoring the utility of large cohorts and possibly explaining the source of discrepancies across studies. Finally, many of our prediction models saturate at these numbers of individuals, suggesting that similar analyses on larger cohorts may not further improve these predictions."
https://openalex.org/W4220700630,"The objective of this study was to develop and validate a state-of-the-art, deep learning (DL)-based model for detecting breast cancers on mammography.Mammograms in a hospital development dataset, a hospital test dataset, and a clinic test dataset were retrospectively collected from January 2006 through December 2017 in Osaka City University Hospital and Medcity21 Clinic. The hospital development dataset and a publicly available digital database for screening mammography (DDSM) dataset were used to train and to validate the RetinaNet, one type of DL-based model, with five-fold cross-validation. The model's sensitivity and mean false positive indications per image (mFPI) and partial area under the curve (AUC) with 1.0 mFPI for both test datasets were externally assessed with the test datasets.The hospital development dataset, hospital test dataset, clinic test dataset, and DDSM development dataset included a total of 3179 images (1448 malignant images), 491 images (225 malignant images), 2821 images (37 malignant images), and 1457 malignant images, respectively. The proposed model detected all cancers with a 0.45-0.47 mFPI and had partial AUCs of 0.93 in both test datasets.The DL-based model developed for this study was able to detect all breast cancers with a very low mFPI. Our DL-based model achieved the highest performance to date, which might lead to improved diagnosis for breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W4220763803,"The interaction of CD155 with its ligand, the T cell immunoreceptor with Ig and ITIM domains (TIGIT), is being studied owing to its potential to act as a target in the treatment of various solid tumors. However, the relationship between CD155 and TIGIT in colorectal cancer (CRC) prognosis is not known. We hypothesized that the TIGIT-CD155 pathway suppresses the attack of T cells on tumors, thereby affecting CRC prognosis.We examined the expression of CD155 and TIGIT using immunohistochemical staining in 100 consecutive patients with CRC who underwent complete resection of ≤Stage III tumors at Wakayama Medical University Hospital between January and December 2013. We assessed the correlation between CD155 and TIGIT expressions and prognosis as well as the clinicopathological background of CD155 and TIGIT.Patients with high CD155 and TIGIT expressions showed worse prognosis than those with other levels of expression (p = 0.026). In multivariate analysis that also included the existing prognostic markers, high CD155 and TIGIT expressions were identified as independent poor prognostic factors.The interaction between CD155 and TIGIT possibly plays an important role in the immunological mechanism of CRC. Therefore, it may be possible to effectively predict the postoperative prognosis of CRC by evaluating the combined expression of CD155 and TIGIT. The study findings suggest that CD155 and TIGIT can predict clinical outcomes, thereby contributing to the personalized care of CRC."
https://openalex.org/W4220847457,"Background The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has impacted health services and healthcare systems worldwide. Studies have shown that hospital admissions for causes related to chronic non-communicable diseases (NCDs) have decreased significantly during peak pandemic periods. An analysis of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on hospital admissions for NCDs is essential to implement disability and mortality mitigation strategies for these groups. Therefore, this study aimed to analyze the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on hospital admissions for NCDs in Brazil according to the type of NCD, sex, age group, and region of Brazil. Methods This is an ecological study conducted in Brazil. Data on hospital admissions from January 1, 2017 to May 31, 2021 were extracted from the Unified Health System’s Hospital Admissions Information System. The hospital admission rates per 100,000 thousand inhabitants were calculated monthly according to the type of NCD, sex, age group, and region of Brazil. Poisson regression models were used to analyze the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the number of hospital admissions. In this study, the pre-pandemic period was set from January 1, 2017 to February 29, 2020 and the during-pandemic from March 1, 2020 to May 31, 2021. Results There was a 27.0% (95.0%CI: -29.0; -25.0%) decrease in hospital admissions for NCDs after the onset of the pandemic compared to that during the pre-pandemic period. Decreases were found for all types of NCDs—cancer (-23.0%; 95.0%CI: -26.0; -21.0%), diabetes mellitus (-24.0%; 95.0%CI: -25.0%; -22.0%), cardiovascular diseases (-30.0%; 95.0%CI: -31.0%; -28.0%), and chronic respiratory diseases (-29.0%; 95.0%CI: -30.0%; -27.0%). In addition, there was a decrease in the number of admissions, regardless of the age group, sex, and region of Brazil. The Northern and Southern regions demonstrated the largest decrease in the percentage of hospital admissions during the pandemic period. Conclusions There was a decrease in the hospitalization rate for NCDs in Brazil during the COVID-19 pandemic in a scenario of social distancing measures and overload of health services."
https://openalex.org/W4220682258,"Under the context of global warming, compound dry and hot events (CDHEs) will increase and bring serious losses to society and the economy. The projection of CDHEs is of great significance for policy-making and risk assessment. In this paper, two large ensemble simulations, CanESM2-LE and CESM-LE, are used to estimate the risk of extreme CDHEs under different warming scenarios in China. First, the biases of the model in the simulation of the temperature and precipitation over the China region are corrected, and the index of CDHEs is established based on a copula function. The results show that extreme CDHEs will occur more often in China with the increase in global warming and the more severe extreme CDHEs are, the greater the risk will be in the future with higher uncertainties. Events that would be attained once every 50 and 100 years in the current climate from CESM-LE (CAanESM2-LE) will be 1.2/1.6 (1.1/1.5) times and 1.3/2.3 (1.5/2.0) times more likely to occur in a 1.5°C/2.0°C warmer climate, respectively. Northwestern China will experience the greatest increase in the risk of extreme CDHEs. Extreme CDHEs expected once every 100 years in the current period over NW China are expected to occur approximately every 5 and 4 years under a 4.0°C warmer world in CanESM2-LE and CESM-LE, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W4220676309,"The impact of omega-3 nutritional manipulation on semen cryosurvival and quality post thawing is controversial. Our aim was to examine how feeding bulls with omega-3 supplementation from different sources affects the spermatozoa quality parameters. Fifteen Israeli Holstein bulls were fed for 13 weeks with a standard ration top-dressed with encapsulated-fat supplementation: fish or flaxseed oil or saturated fatty acids (control). Ejaculates were collected before, during, and after the feeding trial. Frozen-thawed samples were evaluated by a flow cytometer for spermatozoa viability, mitochondrial membrane potential, the level of reactive oxygen species (ROS), acrosome membrane integrity, DNA fragmentation, phosphatidylserine translocation, and membrane fluidity. Both fish and flaxseed oil treatment resulted in lower ROS levels vs. control groups, during and after the feeding trial. Fewer spermatozoa with damaged acrosomes were observed in the fish oil group after the feeding trial. The spermatozoa membrane fluidity was altered in both the fish and flaxseed oil groups throughout the feeding trial, but only in the flaxseed oil group after the feeding trial. The proportion of spermatozoa with fragmented DNA was lower in the flaxseed oil group after the feeding trial. The spermatozoa fertilization competence did not differ between groups however, blastocyst formation rate was higher in the fish and flaxseed oil groups relative to the control. This was associated with differential gene expression in the blastocysts. Overall, the omega-3-enriched food improved the spermatozoa characteristics; this was further expressed in the developing blastocysts, suggesting a carryover effect from the spermatozoa to the embryos."
https://openalex.org/W4220872503,"Epigenetic alterations occur during aging, but it remains unclear what epigenetic features are associated with the onset of physiological decline in animals. Nuclear lamin-B forms the filamentous meshwork underneath the nuclear envelope, providing the structural scaffold necessary for genome organization and gene regulation. We found that reduced level of nuclear lamin-B protein coincides with the decline in locomotor activity and stress resistance in young adult male Drosophila . Ubiquitous lamin-B expression improves locomotor activity of the male flies at the expense of lower stress resistance and shorten lifespan. This observation suggests that tissue-specific expression of lamin-B may regulate different aspects of animal physiology during aging. To test this hypothesis, specific GAL-4 lines were used to drive the expression of lamin-B in specific neuronal populations and muscle tissues in male flies. Ectopic expression of lamin-B in the dopaminergic neurons within the protocerebral anterior medial region of the brain improves the locomotor activity of the male flies with little impact on their stress responses and lifespan. Interestingly, age-dependent decrease in the level of lamin-B protein is independent of its mRNA expression. Instead, cellular thermal shift assay showed that lamin-B and CP190 insulator protein undergo significant change in their solubility during aging. This suggests that the increased solubility of lamin-B protein may contribute to its reduced stability and degradation during aging."

We aimed to clarify the efficiency of Muse cells in a larger animal AMI model of mini-pigs using a semi-clinical grade human Muse cell product.Mini-pigs underwent 30 min of coronary artery occlusion followed by 2 weeks of reperfusion. Semi-clinical grade human Muse cell product (1x107, Muse group, n = 5) or saline (Vehicle group, n = 7) were intravenously administered at 24 h after reperfusion. The infarct size, LV function and remodeling were evaluated by echocardiography. Arrhythmias were evaluated by an implantable loop recorder. The infarct size was significantly smaller in the Muse group (10.5±3.3%) than in the Vehicle group (21.0±2.0%). Both the LV ejection fraction and fractional shortening were significantly greater in the Muse group than in the Vehicle group. The LV end-systolic and end-diastolic dimensions were significantly smaller in the Muse group than in the Vehicle group. Human Muse cells homed into the infarct border area and expressed cardiac troponin I and vascular endothelial CD31. No arrhythmias and no blood test abnormality were observed.Muse cell product might be promising for AMI therapy based on the efficiency and safety in a mini-pig AMI."
https://openalex.org/W4221018128,"A combination of machine learning and expert analyst review was used to detect odontocete echolocation clicks, identify dominant click types, and classify clicks in 32 years of acoustic data collected at 11 autonomous monitoring sites in the western North Atlantic between 2016 and 2019. Previously-described click types for eight known odontocete species or genera were identified in this data set: Blainville's beaked whales (Mesoplodon densirostris), Cuvier's beaked whales (Ziphius cavirostris), Gervais' beaked whales (Mesoplodon europaeus), Sowerby's beaked whales (Mesoplodon bidens), and True's beaked whales (Mesoplodon mirus), Kogia spp., Risso's dolphin (Grampus griseus), and sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus). Six novel delphinid echolocation click types were identified and named according to their median peak frequencies. Consideration of the spatiotemporal distribution of these unidentified click types, and comparison to historical sighting data, enabled assignment of the probable species identity to three of the six types, and group identity to a fourth type. UD36, UD26, and UD28 were attributed to Risso's dolphin (G. griseus), short-finned pilot whale (G. macrorhynchus), and short-beaked common dolphin (D. delphis), respectively, based on similar regional distributions and seasonal presence patterns. UD19 was attributed to one or more species in the subfamily Globicephalinae based on spectral content and signal timing. UD47 and UD38 represent distinct types for which no clear spatiotemporal match was apparent. This approach leveraged the power of big acoustic and big visual data to add to the catalog of known species-specific acoustic signals and yield new inferences about odontocete spatiotemporal distribution patterns. The tools and call types described here can be used for efficient analysis of other existing and future passive acoustic data sets from this region."
https://openalex.org/W4221062488,"The uptake of Nucleic Acid Sequence-Based Amplification (NASBA) for point of care testing may be hindered by a complexity in the workflow due the requirement of a thermal denaturation step to initiate the cyclic isothermal amplification before the addition of the amplification enzymes. Despite reports of successful enhancement of other DNA and RNA amplification methods using DNA and RNA binding proteins, this has not been reported for NASBA. Here, three single-stranded binding proteins, RecA, Extreme Thermostable Single-stranded binding protein (ET SSB) and T4 gene gp32 protein (gp32), were incorporated in NASBA protocol and used for single pot, one-step NASBA at 41 °C. Indeed, all SSBs showed significantly improved amplifications compared with the 2-step process, but only gp32 showed no non-specific aberrant amplification, and slightly improved the time-to-positivity in comparison with the conventional NASBA. For synthetic HIV-1 RNA, gp32 was found to improve the time-to-positivity (ttp) by average of 13.6% of one-step NASBA and 6.7% of conventional NASBA for the detection of HIV-1 RNA, showing its potential for simplifying the workflow as desirable for point of care applications of NASBA."

Post cesarean early neonatal outcomes are associated with preoperative and intraoperative fetomaternal factors which are preventable in the majority of cases.To identify determinants of early neonatal outcomes after emergency cesarean delivery at Hawassa University Comprehensive Specialized Hospital, Hawassa, Southern Ethiopia.Institution based cross sectional study was conducted on 270 emergency cesarean deliveries. Data were collected by using a pretested questionnaire by trained data collectors. Descriptive analysis was used to see the nature of the characteristics of interests. Pearson chi-square-test was used to check presence of association between independent and outcome variables. Bivariate analysis was used to sort out variables at p values less than 0.05 for multivariate logistic regression. Significance level was obtained using odds ratio with 95% CI and p value < 0.05.The prevalence of adverse early neonatal outcome after emergency cesarean delivery was 26.7%. Around 11% of newborns had low (<7) fifth minute Apgar score and more than one-third (34.8%) of them admitted to neonatal intensive care unit for more than 24 hours. Fifteen (5.6%) newborns died within their first seven days of life. Neonates with a preoperative meconium-stained amniotic fluid and low birth weight (< 2500 grams) had greater odds of having adverse early neonatal outcome with (AOR = 6.37; 95% CI: 2.64, 15.34) and (AOR = 14.00; 95% CI: 3.64, 53.84) respectively.The prevalence of adverse early neonatal outcome is high in this study and meconium-stained amniotic fluid during labor as well as low birth weight were the leading predictors of adverse early neonatal outcome during emergency cesarean delivery."

Levels of 92 inflammation-related proteins were simultaneously measured using Target 96 Inflammation ® assay (Olink Proteomics, Uppsala, Sweden) based on Proximity Extension Assay (PEA) technology. Twenty-eight proteins were excluded from further analysis due to lack of >50% of measurable values. Temporal patterns of the remaining 64 proteins were analyzed. Repeated measures ANOVA and its nonparametric equivalent Friedman's ANOVA were used for comparisons of means between time points.Four different patterns (Groups A-D) were visually observed with an early peak and gradually decreasing trend (11 proteins), a middle peak (10 proteins), a late peak after a gradually increasing trend (30 proteins) and no specific pattern (13 proteins). Statistically significant early peaks defined as Day 1 > Day 4 values were noticed in 4 proteins; no significant decreasing trends defined as Day 1 > Day 4 > Day 10 values were observed. Two proteins showed significant middle peaks (i.e. Day 1 < Day 4 > Day 10 values). Statistically significant late peaks (i.e. Day 4 < Day 10 values) and increasing trends (i.e. Day 1 < Day 4 < Day 10 values) were observed in 14 and 10 proteins, respectively. Four of Group D proteins showed biphasic peaks and the rest showed stable levels during the observation period.The comprehensive data set provided in this explorative study may act as an illustration of an inflammatory profile of the acute phase of SAH showing groups of potential protein biomarkers with similar temporal patterns of activation, thus facilitating further research on their role in the pathophysiology of the disease."
https://openalex.org/W4220865293,"Attraction to artificial light at night (ALAN) poses a threat to many fledgling seabirds leaving their nests for the first time. In Hawai'i, fledgling wedge-tailed shearwaters disoriented by lights may become grounded due to exhaustion or collision, exposing them to additional threats from road traffic and predation. While the timing and magnitude of shearwater fallout varies from year to year, little is known about how changing lighting and environmental conditions influence the risk of grounding for this species. We analyzed 8 years (2012-2019) of observations of road-killed shearwaters along the Kalaniana'ole Highway on O'ahu to quantify the timing and magnitude of fallout during the fledging season (November-December). Our goal was to compare fallout before (2012-15) and after (2016-19) a transition in highway lighting from unshielded high-pressure sodium (HPS) to full-cutoff light-emitting diode (LED) streetlights. To detect the shearwater response to the lighting regime, we also accounted for three potential environmental drivers of interannual variability in fallout: moon illumination, wind speed, and wind direction. The effects of these environmental drivers varied across years, with moon illumination, wind speed and wind direction significantly affecting fallout in at least one year. Altogether, the interaction between moon illumination and wind speed was the most important predictor, suggesting that fallout increases during nights with low moon and strong winds. The lack of an increase in fallout after the change from HPS to shielded 3000K - 4000K LED streetlights suggests the new streetlights did not worsen the light pollution impacts on wedge-tailed shearwaters on Southeast O'ahu. However, due to potential species-specific disparities in the behavior and light attraction of petrels, similar studies are needed before energy saving LED lights are implemented throughout the Hawaiian archipelago."
https://openalex.org/W4220960099,"COVID-19 remains a serious disruption to human health, social, and economic existence. Reinfection with the virus intensifies fears and raises more questions among countries, with few documented reports. This study investigated cases of COVID-19 reinfection using patients' laboratory test results between March 2020 and July 2021 in Liberia. Data obtained from Liberia's Ministry of Health COVID-19 surveillance was analyzed in Excel 365 and ArcGIS Pro 2.8.2. Results showed that with a median interval of 200 days (Range: 99-415), 13 out of 5,459 cases were identified and characterized as reinfection in three counties during the country's third wave of the outbreak. Eighty-six percent of the COVID-19 reinfection cases occurred in Montserrado County within high clusters, which accounted for over 80% of the randomly distributed cases in Liberia. More cases of reinfection occurred among international travelers within populations with high community transmissions. This study suggests the need for continued public education and surveillance to encourage longer-term COVID-19 preventive practices even after recovery."
https://openalex.org/W4220964312,"High coverage of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in people living with HIV (PLHIV) increases viral suppression at population level and may reduce incidence. Médecins sans Frontières, in collaboration with the South African Department of Health, has been working in Eshowe/Mbongolwane (KwaZulu Natal) since 2011 to increase access to quality HIV services. Five years after an initial survey, we conducted a second survey to measure progress in HIV diagnosis and viral suppression and to identify remaining gaps.A cross-sectional, population-based, stratified two-stage cluster survey was implemented in 2018, using the same design as in 2013. Consenting participants aged 15-59 years were interviewed and tested for HIV at home. Those HIV-positive were tested for HIV viral load (viral suppression defined as <1000 copies/mL).Overall, 3,278 individuals were included. The proportion of HIV-positive participants virally suppressed was 83.8% in 2018 compared to 57.1% in 2013 (p<0.001), with increases in all subpopulations. The largest gap remained in men aged 15-29 years, among whom viral suppression was 51.5%. Nevertheless, of the total unsuppressed participants, 60.3% were women, and 57.4% were individuals aged 30-59 years. Between 2013 and 2018, HIV-positive status awareness progressed from 75.2% to 89.9% and ART coverage among those aware from 70.4% to 93.8%, respectively. Among those on ART, 94.5% were virally suppressed in 2018.Viral suppression improved significantly from 2013 to 2018, in all age and gender groups of PLHIV. However, almost half of HIV-positive young men remained unsuppressed, while the majority of virally unsuppressed PLHIV were women and older adults. To continue lowering HIV transmission, specific strategies are needed to increase viral suppression in those groups."

However, applications of soft X-ray tomography (SXT), an important approach for characterizing organelle organization, are limited by labor-intensive manual segmentation. Here we report a pipeline for automated segmentation and systematic analysis of SXT tomograms. Our approach combines semantic and first-applied instance segmentation to produce separate organelle masks with high Dice and Recall indexes, followed by analysis of organelle localization based on the radial distribution function. We demonstrated this technique by investigating the organization of INS-1E pancreatic β-cell organization under different treatments at multiple time points. Consistent with a previous analysis of a similar dataset, our results revealed the impact of glucose stimulation on the localization and molecular density of insulin vesicles and mitochondria. This pipeline can be extended to SXT tomograms of any cell type to shed light on the subcellular rearrangements under different drug treatments."
https://openalex.org/W4221132486,"Nearly two years after vitamin E acetate (VEA) was identified as the potential cause of the 2019-2020 outbreak of e-cigarette, or vaping product-associated lung injuries (EVALI), the toxicity mechanisms of VEA vaping are still yet to be fully understood. Studies since the outbreak have found that e-liquids such as VEA undergo thermal degradation during the vaping process to produce various degradation products, which may pose a greater risk of toxicity than exposure to unvaped VEA. Additionally, a wide range of customizable parameters-including the model of e-cigarette used, puffing topography, or the applied power/temperature used to generate aerosols-have been found to influence the physical properties and chemical compositions of vaping emissions. However, the impact of heating coil temperature on the chemical composition of VEA vaping emissions has not been fully assessed. In this study, we investigated the emission product distribution of VEA vaping emissions produced at temperatures ranging from 176 to 356°C, corresponding to a variable voltage vape pen set at 3.3 to 4.8V. VEA degradation was found to be greatly enhanced with increasing temperature, resulting in a shift towards the production of lower molecular weight compounds, such as the redox active duroquinone (DQ) and short-chain alkenes. Low temperature vaping of VEA resulted in the production of long-chain molecules, such as phytol, exposure to which has been suggested to induce lung damage in previous studies. Furthermore, differential product distribution was observed in VEA degradation products generated from vaping and from pyrolysis using a tube furnace in the absence of the heating coil at equivalent temperatures, suggesting the presence of external factors such as metals or oxidation that may enhance VEA degradation during vaping. Overall, our findings indicate that vaping behavior may significantly impact the risk of exposure to toxic vaping products and potential for vaping-related health concerns."
https://openalex.org/W4220664758,"Two theoretical perspectives have been proffered to explain changes in alcohol use during the pandemic: the 'affordability-availability' mechanism (i.e., drinking decreases due to changes in physical availability and/or reduced disposable income) and the 'psychological-coping' mechanism (i.e., drinking increases as adults attempt to cope with pandemic-related distress). We tested these alternative perspectives via longitudinal analyses of the COVID-19 Psychological Consortium (C19PRC) Study data (spanning three timepoints during March to July 2020). Respondents provided data on psychological measures (e.g., anxiety, depression, posttraumatic stress, paranoia, extraversion, neuroticism, death anxiety, COVID-19 anxiety, intolerance of uncertainty, resilience), changes in socio-economic circumstances (e.g., income loss, reduced working hours), drinking motives, solitary drinking, and 'at-risk' drinking (assessed using a modified version of the AUDIT-C). Structural equation modelling was used to determine (i) whether 'at-risk' drinking during the pandemic differed from that recalled before the pandemic, (ii) dimensions of drinking motives and the psychosocial correlates of these dimensions, (iii) if increased alcohol consumption was predicted by drinking motives, solitary drinking, and socio-economic changes. The proportion of adults who recalled engaging in 'at-risk' drinking decreased significantly from 35.9% pre-pandemic to 32.0% during the pandemic. Drinking to cope was uniquely predicted by experiences of anxiety and/or depression and low resilience levels. Income loss or reduced working hours were not associated with coping, social enhancement, or conformity drinking motives, nor changes in drinking during lockdown. In the earliest stage of the pandemic, psychological-coping mechanisms may have been a stronger driver to changes in adults' alcohol use than 'affordability-availability' alone."
https://openalex.org/W4220850553,"In this work, the Longissimus thoracis pig skeletal muscle was used as a model to investigate the impact of two different diets, supplemented with n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids from extruded linseed (L) and polyphenols from grape skin and oregano extracts (L+P), on the lipidomic profile of meat. A standard diet for growing-finishing pigs (CTRL) was used as a control. Changes in lipids profile were investigated through an untargeted lipidomics and transcriptomics combined investigation. The lipidomics identified 1507 compounds, with 195 compounds fitting with the MS/MS spectra of LipidBlast database. When compared with the CTRL group, the L+P diet significantly increased 15 glycerophospholipids and 8 sphingolipids, while the L diet determined a marked up-accumulation of glycerolipids. According to the correlations outlined between discriminant lipids and genes, the L diet may act preventing adipogenesis and the related inflammation processes, while the L+P diet promoted the expression of genes involved in lipids' biosynthesis and adipogenic extracellular matrix formation and functioning."

This study investigated relationship selection and social influence of early adolescents' close friends and admired peers with regard to academic behavioral engagement. A stochastic actor-based model of social network analysis was used to examine classroom social networks across 2 waves (Mage = 11.46; N = 542) based on peer nominations. Adolescents were asked to nominate their ""close friends they hang around with and talk to the most"" and peers that they ""admire, respect, and want to be like"" Results indicated that adolescents who were similar in academic engagement more often became friends. Also, close friends' and admired peers' academic engagement contributed to adolescents' own academic engagement over time. The results suggest that both close friends and admired peers are important channels for social contagion of academic behavior and that examining social relations beyond friends are important for advancing our understanding of peer social influence during adolescence."
https://openalex.org/W4220924220,"Visceral leishmaniasis in humans is a chronic and fatal disease if left untreated. Canine leishmaniasis (CanL) is a severe public health problem because infected animals are powerful transmitters of the parasite to humans via phlebotomine vectors. Therefore, dogs are an essential target for control measures. Progression of canine infection is accompanied by failure of cellular immunity with reduction of circulating lymphocytes and increased cytokines that suppress macrophage function. Studies showed that the regulation of the effector function of macrophages and T cells appears to depend on miRNAs; miRNA-21 (miR-21) shows increased expression in splenic leukocytes of dogs with CanL and targets genes related to the immune response. Mimics and inhibitors of miR-21 were used in vitro to transfect splenic leukocytes from dogs with CanL. After transfection, expression levels of the proteins FAS, FASL, CD69, CCR7, TNF-α, IL-17, IFN-γ, and IL-10 were measured. FAS, FASL, CD69, and CCR7 expression levels decreased in splenic leukocytes from dogs with CanL. The miR-21 mimic decreased CD69 expression in splenic leukocytes from CanL and healthy groups. The miR-21 inhibitor decreased IL-10 levels in culture supernatants from splenic leukocytes in the CanL group. These findings suggest that miR-21 alters the immune response in CanL; therefore, miR-21 could be used as a possible therapeutic target for CanL."
https://openalex.org/W4221061078,"The Comprehensive Case Management Project (CCMP), was a collaborative implementation research initiative to strengthen malaria early detection and complete treatment in Odisha State, India.A two-arm quasi-experimental design was deployed across four districts in Odisha, representing a range of malaria endemicity: Bolangir (low), Dhenkanal (moderate), Angul (high), and Kandhamal (hyper). In each district, a control block received routine malaria control measures, whereas a CCMP block received a range of interventions to intensify surveillance, diagnosis, and case management. Impact was evaluated by difference-in-difference (DID) analysis and interrupted time-series (ITS) analysis of monthly blood examination rate (MBER) and monthly parasite index (MPI) over three phases: phase 1 pre-CCMP (2009-2012) phase 2 CCMP intervention (2013-2015), and phase 3 post-CCMP (2016-2017).During CCMP implementation, adjusting for control blocks, DID and ITS analysis indicated a 25% increase in MBER and a 96% increase in MPI, followed by a -47% decline in MPI post-CCMP, though MBER was maintained. Level changes in MPI between phases 1 and 2 were most marked in Dhenkanal and Angul with increases of 976% and 287%, respectively, but declines in Bolangir (-57%) and Kandhamal (-22%). Between phase 2 and phase 3, despite the MBER remaining relatively constant, substantial decreases in MPI were observed in Dhenkanal (-78%), and Angul (-59%), with a more modest decline in Bolangir (-13%), and an increase in Kandhamal (14%).Overall, CCMP improved malaria early detection and treatment through the enhancement of the existing network of malaria services which positively impacted case incidence in three districts. In Kandhamal, which is hyperendemic, the impact was not evident. However, in Dhenkanal and Angul, areas of moderate-to-high malaria endemicity, CCMP interventions precipitated a dramatic increase in case detection and a subsequent decline in malaria incidence, particularly in previously difficult-to-reach communities."

From the facilitators perspective, each member's subjective well-being plays a crucial role in sharing intention. On the other hand, from the barriers point of view, social network site exhaustion would negatively affect. The survey was conducted on two online support groups, including parents of children with autism spectrum disorder and caregivers of dementia disease. This study collected 330 questionnaires from social network sites to examine the research model. The results showed that social support positively affects members' self-efficacy; in turn, self-efficacy has a positive effect on subjective well-being. Overload has an impact on psychological distress. Moreover, members' subjective well-being determined their knowledge sharing intention."

We operationalized seven entropy-based metrics including character, wordform unigram, wordform bigram and wordform trigram, POS (Part-of-speech) unigram, POS bigram and POS trigram entropy from two balanced Chinese comparable corpora (translated vs non-translated) for data mining and analysis. We then applied four data mining techniques including Support Vector Machines (SVMs), Linear discriminant analysis (LDA), Random Forest (RF) and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) to distinguish translated Chinese from original Chinese based on these seven features. Our results show that SVMs is the most robust and effective classifier, yielding an AUC of 90.5% and an accuracy rate of 84.3%. Our results have affirmed the hypothesis that translational language is categorically different from original language. Our research demonstrates that combining information-theoretic indicator of Shannon's entropy together with machine learning techniques can provide a novel approach for studying translation as a unique communicative activity. This study has yielded new insights for corpus-based studies on the translationese phenomenon in the field of translation studies."
https://openalex.org/W4220859136,"CD4+ cell count recovery after effective antiretroviral therapy (ART) is an important determinant of both AIDS and non-AIDS morbidity and mortality. Data on CD4+ cell count recovery after initiation of ART are still limited in Sub-Saharan Africa. The aim of this study was to assess CD4+ cell count recovery among HIV-infected adults initiating ART in an Ethiopian setting.A retrospective cohort study of HIV-infected adults initiating ART between September 2008 and June 2019 was carried out. CD4+ cell count recovery was defined as an increase in CD4+ cell count of >100 cells/mm3 from baseline or achievement of a CD4+ cell count >500 cells/mm3 at 12 months after ART initiation. Factors associated with CD4+ cell count recovery were evaluated using logistic regression analysis.Of the 566 patients included in this study, the median baseline CD4+ cell count was 264 cells/mm3 (IQR: 192-500). At 12 months after ART initiation, the median CD4+ cell count increased to 472 cells/mm3, and the proportion of patients with CD4+ cell count < 200 cells/mm3 declined from 28.3 to 15.0%. A total of 58.0% of patients had an increase in CD4+ cell count of >100 cells/mm3 from baseline and 48.6% achieved a CD4+ cell count >500 cells/mm3 at 12 months. Among patients with CD4+ cell counts < 200, 200-350 and >350 cells/mm3 at baseline, respectively, 30%, 43.9% and 61.7% achieved a CD4+ cell count >500 cells/mm3 at 12 months. In multivariable analysis, poor CD4+ cell count recovery (an increase of ≤100 cells/mm3 from baseline) was associated with older age, male sex, higher baseline CD4+ cell count and zidovudine-containing initial regimen. Factors associated with poor CD4+ cell count recovery to reach the level >500 cells/mm3 included older age, male sex and lower baseline CD4+ cell count.CD4+ cell count failed to recover in a substantial proportion of adults initiating ART in this resource-limited setting. Older age, male sex and baseline CD4+ cell count are the dominant factors for poor CD4+ cell count recovery. Novel therapeutic approaches are needed focusing on high risk patients to maximize CD4+ cell count recovery and improve outcomes during therapy."
https://openalex.org/W4220946791,"Cleft lip and palate (cleft L/P) is one of the most common congenital anomalies and its etiology is assumed to be multifactorial. Recent epidemiological data involving a small number of participants suggested an association between perinatal exposure to heavy metals and cleft L/P in affected children. However, this association requires further investigation in a large cohort.This nested case-control study used a dataset of The Japan Environment and Children's Study, which is an ongoing research project to investigate the association between environmental factors and mother-child health. Participants were enrolled between 2011 and 2014. From the records of fetuses/children, we extracted data of isolated cleft L/P cases and matched children without cleft L/P at a ratio of 1:10. The exposures of interest were in utero exposure to four metals (mercury [Hg], lead [Pb], cadmium [Cd], and manganese [Mn]), which were sampled from mothers in the second/third trimester. Conditional logistic regression was used to assess the association between heavy metal exposure and isolated cleft L/P. Three sensitivity analyses were conducted to test the robustness of the findings, including the change in case definition and statistical methods.Of 104,062 fetal records involving both live-birth and stillbirth, we identified 192 children with isolated cleft L/P and 1,920 matched controls. Overall, the blood metal levels were low (for example, median Pb level was 5.85, 6.22, and 5.75 μg/L in the total cohort, cases, and controls, respectively). Univariate and multivariate analyses showed that levels of none of the four heavy metals in the mother's blood during pregnancy were associated with the risk of cleft L/P in offspring; the adjusted odds ratios (per 1 μg/L increase) with 95% intervals were 0.96 (0.91-1.03), 1.01 (0.94-1.08), 1.00 (0.61-1.63) and 1.00 (0.97-1.03) for Hg, Pb, Cd and Mn, respectively. The results were consistent in all sensitivity analyses.Exposure to these four metals during pregnancy was not associated with isolated cleft L/P at the low exposure level in our cohort."

This paper introduces fractional-order into a mathematical model of HIV infection combining with stem cell therapy and control the infection by the immune system cells (CD8+ T cells). The paper introduced the numerical solutions for the mathematical model. The results show that the stem cell therapy with the activation of immune system cells might causes the cure for a HIV patient. This results are consistent with medical studies.

https://openalex.org/W4221010947,"In humans, celiac disease (CeD) is a T-cell-driven gluten-sensitive enteropathy (GSE) localized to the small bowel (duodenum). The presence of antibodies specific for gluten- and self-antigens are commonly used diagnostic biomarkers of CeD and are considered to play a role in GSE pathogenesis. Previously, we have described an apparent T-cell-mediated GSE in CD19 -/- mice, which develop weak and abnormal B cell responses. Here, we expand on this observation and use a mouse model of complete B cell deficiency (J H -/- mice), to show that absence of a humoral immune response also promotes development of a GSE. Furthermore, 16S analysis of microbial communities in the small intestine demonstrates that a gluten-free diet suppresses the expansion of anaerobic bacteria in the small intestine and colonization of the small intestine by a specific pathobiont. Finally, we also observe that SI enteropathy in mice fed a gluten-rich diet is positively correlated with the abundance of several microbial peptidase genes, which supports that bacterial metabolism of gluten may be an important driver of GSE in our model. Collectively, results from our experiments indicate that J H -/- mice will be a useful resource to investigators seeking to empirically delineate the contribution of humoral immunity on GSE pathogenesis, and support the hypothesis that humoral immunity promotes tolerance to gluten."

The urgent need for COVID-19 research created new ethical, regulatory, and practical challenges. The next public health emergency could be worse than COVID-19. We must learn about these challenges from the experiences of researchers and Research Ethics Committee professionals responsible for these COVID-19 studies to prepare for the next emergency.We conducted an online survey to identify the ethical, oversight, and regulatory challenges of conducting COVID-19 research during the early pandemic, and proposed solutions for overcoming these barriers. Using criterion-based, convenience sampling, we invited researchers who proposed or conducted COVID-19 research to complete an anonymous, online survey about their experiences. We administered a separate but related survey to Institutional Review Board (IRB) professionals who reviewed COVID-19 research studies. The surveys included open-ended and demographic items. We performed inductive content analysis on responses to open-ended survey questions.IRB professionals (n = 143) and researchers (n = 211) described 19 types of barriers to COVID-19 research, related to 5 overarching categories: policy and regulatory, biases and misperceptions, institutional and inter-institutional conflicts, risks of harm, and pressure of the pandemic. Researchers and IRB professionals described 8 categories of adaptations and solutions to these challenges: enacting technological solutions; developing protocol-based solutions; disposition and team management; establishing and communicating appropriate standards; national guidance and leadership; maintaining high standards; prioritizing studies before IRB review; and identifying and incorporating experts.This inventory of challenges represents ongoing barriers to studying the current pandemic, and they represent a risk to research during future public health emergencies. Delays in studies of a pandemic during a pandemic threatens the health and safety of the public. We urge the development of a national working group to address these issues before the next public health emergency arises."

In this work, a scenario is presented where a robot has limited energy, and the only way to survive is to access the energy from an unregulated power source. With no wires or resistors available, the robot heuristically learns to maximize the input voltage on its system while avoiding potential obstacles during the connection. CircuitBot is a 6 DOF manipulator capable of drawing circuit patterns with graphene-based conductive ink, and it uses a state-of-the-art continuous/categorical Bayesian Optimization to optimize the placement of conductive shapes and maximize the energy it receives. Our comparative results with traditional Bayesian Optimization and Genetic algorithms show that the robot learns to maximize the voltage within the smallest number of trials, even when we introduce obstacles to ground the circuit and steal energy from the robot. As autonomous robots become more present, in our houses and other planets, our proposed method brings a novel way for machines to keep themselves functional by optimizing their own electric circuits."
https://openalex.org/W4220779385,"The incidence of oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) is increasing globally, reflecting an increase in human papillomavirus (HPV)-related lesions. Indigenous populations are disproportionately affected by OPSCCs. Currently, testing for oral HPV is not recommended as a screening tool to permit early detection of OPSCCs due to the high population prevalence of HPV infection. Periodontitis may be a marker of oral HPV infection, but previous research evaluating this association has been inconclusive. Here we report a large population-based study examining the association between high-risk oral HPV infection and periodontitis among Indigenous South Australians.We utilised a large convenience sample of Indigenous South Australians aged 18+ years recruited between February 2018 and February 2020. Of the original cohort (n = 1011), 748 (73.9%) participants participated in the 12 month follow-up. Detailed information on sociodemographic characteristics, health-related behaviours, and sexual history were collected at enrolment. Saliva samples were collected at 12 months and tested for the presence of oral HPV DNA using the optimized general primer (GP) + PCR system. The primary outcomes were the prevalence of any high-risk oral HPV DNA, and separately, HPV 16 and/or 18. Periodontitis was assessed at follow-up by using validated self-reported periodontitis screening questions. Logistic regression analyses were undertaken to assess the association between self-reported periodontitis and oral HPV infection with adjustment for potential sociodemographic and behavioural confounders, with estimates presented as odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI).Data on 673 participants (89.9% of the follow-up cohort) were available. Participants ranged in age from 18 to 80 (mean age 42.2, SD 14.7) and 31.5% were male. Overall, 115 (17.1%) participants had self-reported periodontitis, 40 (5.9%) had any high-risk oral HPV and 14 (2.1%) had HPV 16 and/or 18. Any high-risk HPV was detected among seven (17.5%) participants and HPV 16 and/or 18 was detected in three (21.4%) who self-reported periodontitis. In the regression analyses no significant association was found between self-reported periodontitis and high-risk oral HPV (adjusted OR: 1.10; 95% CI: 0.45-2.70) or HPV 16 and/or 18 (adjusted OR: 1.27; 95% CI: 0.32-5.03).This study did not find any association between self-reported periodontitis and high-risk oral HPV among Indigenous South Australians. Further targeted studies with standardized clinical measures of periodontal disease are needed to clarify the link between high-risk oral HPV and periodontal disease. If confirmed this would add further weight to the importance of recommendations about the utility of periodontitis screening to identify individuals at risk of carrying high-risk oral HPV, who may benefit from more intensive screening and ongoing monitoring."
https://openalex.org/W4220811032,"Fasciolosis is a severe zoonosis responsible for major economic losses in livestock. The enhanced MM3-COPRO test (eMM3-COPRO) and the commercial version BIO K 201 (Bio-X Diagnostics, Rochefort, Belgium) are widely used as immunodiagnostic tools for the specific detection of coproantigens released by Fasciola during the late prepatent and patent stages of infection. However, performance of the eMM3-COPRO has never been evaluated under field conditions. To address this gap, a large number of ovine faecal samples, collected in a region where fasciolosis is endemic (Galicia, NW Spain), were analyzed. Two groups of sheep flocks were selected according to the Fasciola infection status: 'Fasciola-free' and 'Fasciola-infected' flocks. 'Fasciola-free' flocks were seronegative flocks with no history of fasciolosis detected by either coproscopy or necropsy in the last 5 years. Faecal samples from these sheep were used to calculate a cut-off value for infection (OD = 0.021). The cut-off was calculated using a bootstrap resampling method that enables estimation of the sampling distribution of the statistical parameters without making assumptions about the underlying data distribution. 'Fasciola-infected' flocks were characterized by high seroprevalence, a history of fasciolosis and periodical treatment with flukicides. Samples from these flocks were used to estimate the diagnostic accuracy of the eMM3-COPRO relative to coproscopy, which although limited by poor sensitivity is the only reference test available for diagnosing fasciolosis in vivo. To overcome this limitation, all animals classified positive by eMM3-COPRO were treated with triclabendazole and then retested. The eMM3-COPRO displayed higher sensitivity than coproscopy, as it detected coproantigens in all samples with positive coproscopy and in 12% of samples with negative coproscopy. The test also proved highly specific as coproantigens disappeared after the treatment. The eMM3-COPRO was less time consuming than coproscopy, particularly when the procedure involved numerous samples, and showed promise as a tool for monitoring flukicide efficacy."

Pulmonary NTM infections lead to TB-like disease called NTM pulmonary disease (NTM-PD). Due to variation in treatment options among NTM species, it is necessary to identify the species and determine drug susceptibility profiles to inform the choice of appropriate regimen for the disease.A total of 188 culture-positive isolates from patients diagnosed with TB were screened for NTM at the Central Tuberculosis Reference Laboratory. All NTM were further speciated using GenoType® Mycobacterium-Common Mycobacterium and Additional species (GenoType® CM/AS) kit. Mycobacteria avium complex (MAC) and Mycobacteria abscessus complex (MABC) which could not be identified with the test to species were subjected to GenoType® Mycobacteria NTM-DR for further speciation. Using the same test, identified MAC and MABC were genotyped to determine the drug susceptibility profile for each isolate to macrolide and aminoglycosides.Of all isolates identified as mycobacteria, 24 (13%) were NTM. Fifteen isolates could be identified to species level of which prevalent species was M. avium sub. intracellulare 4 (27%). A total of 10 isolates were MAC (n = 6) and MABC (n = 4) were subjected to GenoType® Mycobacteria NTM-DR for determination of macrolide and aminoglycoside susceptibility. Three of the four MABC had a mutation at the T28 position of the erm (41). All MAC were susceptible to both drugs.In this study, MAC was the most frequently isolated NTM species followed by MABC. While all MAC and MABC identified, were susceptible to aminoglycosides, three MABC were resistant to the macrolides due to mutation at position 28 of the erm (41) gene. For this, it is important for clinicians need to rule out NTM, understand species and their drug susceptibility for optimal case management."
https://openalex.org/W4221012508,"South Africa has many fenced reserves harbouring small to medium sized populations of African elephant ( Loxodonta africana ), most of which have been translocated. Elephants on fenced reserves may be exposed to various management interventions and practices (translocation, hunting, darting, high tourism impact, contraception programs, disruption due to infrastructure maintenance, etc.). These factors may impact the welfare of elephants. Poor elephant welfare may have serious consequences such as increased inter- and intra-species aggression that could result in fatalities. This is the first study to attempt to define behavioural and physiological welfare parameters for free-ranging elephants on small to medium sized reserves. The eight study sites incorporated reserves with different social structure combinations, elephant life-histories, reserve sizes, habitat, management, and tourism intensity. Data collection consisted of behavioural observations (10-minute videos) as well as faecal samples. By incorporating both behavioural and physiological (faecal glucocorticoid metabolite (fGCM) concentration) parameters, we aimed to investigate whether the two parameters showed similar trends. Five behavioural categories were identified (Arousal, Assessing, Ambivalent, Ambivalent/ Body care, and Frustrated behaviour), with various detailed behaviours demonstrated by the elephants that may indicate the influence of anthropogenic disturbance and possibly impact on animal welfare. The study showed significant differences between the selected detailed behaviours, behavioural categories and fGCM concentrations of elephants across the eight reserves. History seemed to be a decisive factor, as reserves with predominantly ex-captive elephants showed higher frequencies of certain behaviours as well as higher fGCM concentrations. Age, sex, reserve size and season were also found to contribute to our defined welfare indices and fGCM concentrations. This indicates that behavioural parameters, indicative of certain behavioural states, are valuable indicators of welfare, as supported by the physiological response of the elephants. The results also highlight the importance of taking multiple specified behaviours from a category into consideration when evaluating the welfare of elephants, to account for individual variation."

To investigate the role of semiconductor sequencing for detection of predictive biomarkers in routine glioblastoma samples we have undertaken analysis of test trending data generated by a clinically validated next generation sequencing platform designed to capture actionable genomic variants distributed across 505 genes. Analysis was performed across a cohort of 55 glioblastoma patients. Analysis of trending data has revealed a complex and rich actionable mutational landscape in which 166 actionable mutations were detected across 36 genes linked to 17 off label targeted therapy protocols and 111 clinical trials. The majority of patients harboured three or more actionable mutations affecting key cancer related regulatory networks including the PI3K/AKT/MTOR and RAS/RAF/MEK/MAPK signalling pathways, DNA-damage repair pathways and cell cycle checkpoints. Linkage with immunotherapy and PARP inhibitors was identified in 44% of glioblastoma patients as a consequence of alterations in DNA-damage repair genes. Taken together our data indicates that precision oncology testing utilising semiconductor sequencing can be used to identify a broad therapeutic armamentarium of targeted therapies and immunotherapies that can be potentially employed for the improved clinical management of glioblastoma patients."
https://openalex.org/W4221091419,"Healthcare-associated adverse events represent a heavy burden of symptoms for pediatric oncology patients. Their description allows knowing the safety and quality of the care processes in countries with limited resources. This study aimed to describe the incidence, types, severity, and preventability of adverse events occurring in pediatric patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia during the induction phase in a tertiary care pediatric hospital in Mexico. This study analyzed a cohort based on medical records of between 2015 and 2017. Initially, information on patients and adverse events was collected; subsequently, two pediatric oncologist reviewers independently classified adverse events, severity and preventability. Agreement between reviewers was evaluated. Adverse events incidence rates were estimated by type, severity, and preventability. One-hundred and eighty-one pediatric patients pediatric patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia were studied. An overall adverse events rate of 51.8 per 1000 patient-days was estimated, involving 81.2% of patients during induction. Most adverse events were severe or higher (52.6%). Infectious processes were the most common severe or higher adverse event (30.5%). The presence of adverse events caused 80.2% of hospital readmissions. Of the adverse events, 10.5% were considered preventable and 53.6% could be ameliorable in severity. Improving the safety and quality of the care processes of children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia is possible, and this should contribute to the mitigation and prevention of adverse events associated morbidity and mortality during the remission induction phase."
https://openalex.org/W4220742771,"The importance of gender norms in agricultural innovation processes has been recognized. However, the operational integration of these normative issues into the innovation strategies of agricultural interventions remains challenging. This article advances a replicable, integrative research approach that captures key local conditions to inform the design and targeting of gender-inclusive interventions. We focus on the gender climate across multiple contexts to add to the limited indicators available for assessing gender norms at scale. The notion of gender climate refers to the socially constituted rules that prescribe men's and women's behaviour in a specific geographic location-with some being more restrictive and others more relaxed. We examine the gender climate of 70 villages across 13 countries where agriculture is an important livelihood. Based on data from the GENNOVATE initiative we use multivariate methods to identify three principal components: 'Gender Climate', 'Opportunity' and 'Connectivity'. Pairwise correlation and variance partitioning analyses investigate the linkages between components. Our findings evidence that favourable economic or infrastructure conditions do not necessarily correlate with favourable gender normative conditions. Drawing from two case-study villages from Nepal, we highlight opportunities for agricultural research for development interventions. Overall, our approach allows to integrate local knowledge about gender norms and other local conditions into the planning and targeting strategies for agricultural innovation."
https://openalex.org/W4220842372,"Predatory fishes on coral reefs continue to decline globally despite playing key roles in ecosystem functioning. Remote atolls and platform reefs provide potential refugia for predator populations, but quantitative information on their spatial distribution is required to establish accurate baselines for ongoing monitoring and conservation management. Current knowledge of predatory fish populations has been derived from targeted shallow diver-based surveys (<15 m). However, the spatial distribution and extent of predatory fishes on outer mesophotic shelf environments has remained under described. Middleton Reef is a remote, high-latitude, oceanic platform reef that is located within a no-take area in the Lord Howe Marine Park off eastern Australia. Here we used baited remote underwater stereo video to sample predatory fishes across lagoon and outer shelf habitats from depths 0-100 m, extending knowledge on use of mesophotic depths and habitats. Many predatory fish demonstrated clear depth and habitat associations over this depth range. Carcharhinid sharks and Carangid fishes were the most abundant predators sampled on Middleton Reef, with five predatory fishes accounting for over 90% of the predator fish biomass. Notably, Galapagos shark (Carcharhinus galapagensis) and the protected black rockcod (Epinephelus daemelii) dominated the predator fish assemblage. A higher richness of predator fish species was sampled on reef areas north and south of the lagoon. The more exposed southern aspect of the reef supported a different suite of predator fish across mesophotic habitats relative to the assemblage recorded in the north and lagoonal habitats, a pattern potentially driven by differences in hard coral cover. Biomass of predatory fishes in the more sheltered north habitats was twice that of other areas, predominantly driven by high abundances of Galapagos shark. This work adds to the growing body of literature highlighting the conservation value of isolated oceanic reefs and the need to ensure that lagoon, shallow and mesophotic habitats in these systems are adequately protected, as they support vulnerable ecologically and economically important predator fish assemblages."
https://openalex.org/W4220916118,"Stroke is a major cause of mortality and disability worldwide. People with stroke have a number of options available to treat post-stroke related symptoms and challenges. The aim of this study was to assess the use of healthcare services, self-care practices and out-of-pocket expenses associated with post-stroke healthcare.We retrospectively analysed data collected between April and October 2017 from a survey of 576 participants aged 55 to 96 from the 45 and Up Study, NSW (Australia), who had earlier reported a clinical diagnosis of stroke. Participants were asked about their use of health care services, including conventional medicine practitioners and medications, complementary medicine practitioners, practices and products and the respective associated out-of-pocket expenditure for each.Amongst the total of 576 individuals who participated in the study, 39% consulted a doctor, 18% consulted an allied health practitioner, and 8% consulted a complementary medicine practitioner in the previous year for their stroke. Participants' average combined out-of-pocket expenditure for post-stroke related healthcare was AU$386.4 per annum. Extrapolated to all Australians with stroke, aged 55 years and over, the total out-of-pocket expenditure for post-stroke related healthcare is estimated to be AU$42 million per annum.Post-stroke individuals used a wide range of health services and various self-care practices for stroke rehabilitation. Such healthcare utilisation is associated with significant annual out-of-pocket expenditure. Given the socioeconomic burden of stroke, further research is required to identify the barriers and facilitators of self-care among patients with stroke and explore the cost-effectiveness of the wide range of treatments(s) utilised for post-stroke care."
https://openalex.org/W4220919269,"Nearly two-thirds of psychiatric patients are reluctant to seek help from healthcare professionals due to stigma, discrimination, and negligence that evolve around the community, including healthcare providers. Future health professionals should have a positive attitude toward psychiatry and patients with mental health problems. Thus, it is vital to identify medical students' attitudes toward psychiatry as future healthcare providers. The authors conducted a cross-sectional study by using online questionnaires of ""Perceptions of Psychiatry"" in Faculty of Medicine Universitas Indonesia, with first- and fourth-year students (before psychiatric rotation), as well as fifth-year students and alumni (after psychiatric rotation). Out of 250 questionnaires distributed, 224 subjects responded, with a response rate 89.6%. Chi-square or fisher analysis was conducted to know the correlation between gender and attitudes towards psychiatry. The frequency distribution method was applied to identify the degree of stigmatization from respondents. A mix of positive and negative perceptions towards psychiatry was identified. The overall response was favorable to both before and after psychiatric rotation groups. Differences in perceptions between male and female psychiatry students as a discipline and career were statistically significant. Correcting misapprehension and removing the stigma on psychiatry during medical education might decrease the stigma in the psychiatric field and patients."
https://openalex.org/W4220930794,"The flexibility afforded by online education may provide opportunities for learners with disability who require absence from traditional learning environments. This study sought to describe how a subset of learners with disability, those with hospital-homebound designation, perform in K-12 online classes, particularly as compared to non-hospital homebound counterparts. A cross-sectional analysis was performed of all Florida Virtual School course enrollments from August 1, 2012 to July 31, 2018. Researchers analyzed 2,534 course enrollments associated with K-12 students who, at the time of their course enrollment, had hospital-homebound designation, and a comparison group of 5,470,591 enrollments from K-12 students without hospital-homebound status. Data analysis showed three important outcomes. First, hospital-homebound designated student academic performance was equivalent to their non-hospital homebound counterparts. Second, however, hospital-homebound course enrollments were 26% more likely to result in a withdrawal prior to grade generation. Third, these withdrawals were potentially mitigated when H/H designated students were enrolled in five or more classes or in classes with five or more students. The results of this study provided evidence that when they can remain enrolled, hospital-homebound learners experience equivalent academic outcomes in online learning environments. These findings suggest that healthcare professionals should be made aware of the potentially equivalent outcomes for their patients. Moreover, virtual schools should seek to identify and create supports for these students."
https://openalex.org/W4221069572,"In 2019, 2.4 million neonates died globally, with most deaths occurring in low-resource settings. Despite the introduction of neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) in these settings, neonatal mortality remains high, and caring for sick neonates around the clock can be challenging due to limited staff and resources.To evaluate whether neonatal intensive care admissions during daytime and overnight hours affects in-hospital neonatal mortality.A retrospective case-control study was conducted using 2016 chart data at a University hospital in Ethiopia. Cases were defined as neonates who died in the NICU, and controls were defined as neonates who survived. Overnight hours were defined as 17:00 to 07:59, and day hours were defined as 08:00 to 16:59. Univariate and multivariate logistic regressions were used to investigate the relationship between time of admission and mortality, along with perinatal characteristics.A total of 812 neonates, 207 cases and 605 controls, met inclusion criteria. There were 342 admissions during the day and 470 overnight. Neonatal mortality (aOR 1.02, 95% CI [0.64-1.62], p = 0.93) was not associated with overnight admissions after controlling for maternal age, parity, C-section, birthweight, and gestational age, respiratory distress, and admission level of consciousness. Admission heart rate >160 (aOR 0.52, 95% CI [0.30-0.91], p = 0.02) was the only variable significantly associated with overnight admissions.Being admitted overnight to the NICU in Gondar, Ethiopia was not associated with increased mortality, consistent with a constant level of care, regardless of the time of admission. Further qualitative and implementation research are needed to understand contextual factors that have affected these data."
https://openalex.org/W4221090368,"Images of original pupae of Zeugodacus cucurbitae (Coquillett) were normalized, grayed, and segmented to identify male and female pupae of this species via machine vision. The image of each pupa was divided into 25 small areas. The differences in surface texture features in each small area within 11 days were compared. The texture characteristics of both male and female pupae were screened by combining the eclosion of both sexes of Z. cucurbitae (Coquillett). Results indicated that the pectinate setae on the abdominal backplane could be used as a basis for the identification of the male and female pupa of Z. cucurbitae (Coquillett). Moreover, machine vision correctly identified these characteristics with an accuracy of 96.0%. This study lays a foundation for the identification of male and female pupae using machine vision and also for the comprehensive control of Z. cucurbitae (Coquillett)."
