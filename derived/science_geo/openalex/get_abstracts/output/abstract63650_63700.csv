https://openalex.org/W2070900790,Nerve cells in the monkey's prefrontal cortex and nucleus medialis dorsalis of the thalamus show changes of firing frequency associated with the performance of a delayed response test. Most cells increase firing during the cue presentation period or at the beginning of the ensuing delay; spike discharge highler than that in intertrial periods is present in some cells throughout the delay. These changes are interpreted as suggestive evidence of a role of frontothalamic circuits in the attentive process involved in short-term memory
https://openalex.org/W1514432626,"The stability of postlogarithmic mRNA has been assessed in Bacillus subtilis during sporulation time periods. The appearance of refractile bodies, alkaline phosphatase synthesis, and total protein synthesis is controlled by mRNA which has an estimated half-life of less than 10 min. Inhibition of RNA synthesis at various times by rifampin addition or temperature shift with a temperature-sensitive RNA polymerase mutant demonstrates that postlogarithmic mRNA is unstable and that continuous RNA synthesis is necessary for expression of the developmental sequence. The addition of chloramphenicol also inhibits the appearance of refractile bodies and alkaline phosphatase synthesis, suggesting that these processes require de novo protein synthesis."

https://openalex.org/W1972670736,"The production of cerebrospinal fluid and the transport of (24)Na from the blood to the cerebrospinal fluid were studied simultaneously in normal and choroid plexectomized rhesus monkeys. Choroid plexectomy reduced the production of cerebrospinal fluid by an average of 33 to 40 percent and the rate of appearance of (24)Na in the cerebrospinal fluid and its final concentration were proportionately reduced. In both normal and plexectomized animals, (24)Na levels were found to be markedly greater in the gray matter surrounding the ventricles and in the gray matter bordering the subarachnoid space. That sodium exchanges in these two general areas of the brain may be linked to the formation of the cerebrospinal fluid is discussed here."

https://openalex.org/W2032272674,"To summarize, data on the course of development of mother-infant relations in rhesus monkeys have been presented; a method for teasing apart the relative roles of mother and infant in causing changes or differences in the interaction described; and the complexity of the social nexus, within which the relationship is set, stressed. When the mother is removed for a few days, the infant calls a great deal at first and then shows depressed locomotor and play activity. These symptoms may last for a month after the mother's return. Simple tests given 6 months and even 2 years later strongly suggest that the differences (between infants that have had such a separation experience and infants that have not) are persistent."
https://openalex.org/W2008826268,"Under normal conditions of DNA renaturation, about 60 percent of mouse DNA fragments renature at a rate consistent with their being present only once per sperm. These nonrepeated sequences (also called single-copy or unique) may be used in RNA-DNA hybridization experiments to provide quantitative estimates of RNA diversity. About 10 percent of the mouse single-copy sequences are transcribed in mouse brain tissue. Estimates of about 3 percent were obtained for mouse liver and kidney RNA's. If only one of the complementary DNA strands is transcribed, this hybridization value implies that the equivalent of at least 300,000 different sequences of 1000 nucleotides are expressed in mouse brain tissue. It is suggested that the large amount of DNA in mammals is functionally important, and that a substantial proportion of the genome is expressed in the brain."
https://openalex.org/W1637709258,"Mild digestion of isolated adipose tissue cells with Clostridium perfringens neuraminidase (10 to 20 mµg of purified enzyme per ml, 15 min at 37°) results in enhanced glucose transport by these cells. This effect appears to mimic closely the physiological effect of insulin on glucose transport by normal cells, and there is evidence to suggest that these two apparently different stimuli may affect similar membrane structures. Digestion of fat cells with higher concentrations of neuraminidase (about 1 µg of purified enzyme per ml, 15 min, 37°) causes a fall in the enhanced basal rate of glucose transport described above and abolishes the effects of insulin on glucose transport and on lipolysis. Such enzymatic digestion, however, has no effect on the total quantity of specific cell membrane receptor for insulin or in the affinity of the insulin-receptor complex. The biological and the receptor-binding properties of insulin are thus dissociated. The loss of insulin-stimulated glucose transport caused by neuraminidase digestion does not reverse spontaneously by prolonged incubation of the cells after digestion. Neuraminidases from C. perfringens, Vibrio cholerae and influenza virus were purified by affinity chromatography using selective agarose adsorbents containing an oxamic acid derivative. The three enzymes, at low concentration, can destroy the glucose transport effects of insulin on fat cells. However, the specific patterns of digestion observed with the three different enzymes are not identical, probably as a result of the differences in substrate specificity of the enzymes. Differently linked sialic acid residues at the cell surface may participate differently in various membrane functions. The effects of digesting fat cells with various combinations of C. perfringens neuraminidase and trypsin on glucose oxidation and the patterns of release of sialic acid and sialyl peptides suggest that the biological effects resulting from digesting cells with these enzymes are a consequence of cleavage of similar portions of the same or closely related membrane structures. Sialic acid at the cell surface is intimately involved in the processes concerned with transmitting the effects of insulin on membrane glucose transport and lipolysis, but it is not involved in the recognition of insulin by the receptor. Despite the unessential role of sialic acid in the function of insulinrecognition by the receptor, this moiety may nonetheless be a constituent of a glycoprotein insulin receptor."

The infusion was given either continuously over 24 hours or divided into discrete meals programed to simulate the rats' natural eating pattern. The same diet was also available for consumption by mouth. In neither case did the animals completely stop eating. During slow infusions excessive consumption ranged from 30 to 50 percent. During simulated meal infusion of the same total quantity of diet, they compensated far better, overeating by only 2 to 18 percent. Periodic filling of the stomach between scheduled meals was no more effective than a continuous slow infusion. Therefore, factors related to the natural feeding cycle make a significant contribution to the effectiveness of food in maintaining satiety and controlling food intake."
https://openalex.org/W1544882381,"Human red blood cell membranes contain at least 17 polypeptides of differing molecular weight ranging from 27,000 to 220,000. Previous publications have reported higher values for the largest molecular weight species, but are in error owing to incorrect calibration of sodium dodecylsulfate-polyacrylamide gels with unreduced proteins. The two highest molecular weight species which constitute approximately 40% of the total membrane protein have molecular weights of 200,000 and 220,000. It is shown that these polypeptides are not aggregates of a lower molecular weight species, and analysis of the entire membrane by gel filtration in 6 m guanidine hydrochloride reveals no significant amount of protein with molecular weight less than that of hemoglobin. Solubilization of a fraction of the membrane protein in EDTA according to the method of Marchesi et al. (Marchesi, S. L., Steers, E., Marchesi, V. T., and Tillack, T. W., Biochemistry, 9, 50 (1970)) produced a heterogeneous mixture of polypeptide chains. Prolonged exposure to this solvent leads to dissolution of over 90% of the membrane protein."
https://openalex.org/W1938082510,"Abstract An effective technique has been developed for isolating and purifying the tyrosinases of mouse melanoma. The soluble tyrosinases normally present in the crude homogenate of melanoma tissue have been separated from the other proteins of the homogenate by repeated electrophoresis in urea-containing polyacrylamide gel systems. The amount of purified, soluble enzyme recovered by this technique is essentially equal to that initially present in the supernatant of an homogenate of freshly excised or fresh frozen mouse melanoma tissue. Three distinct forms of active tyrosinase (EC 1.10.3.1) were found: two soluble and one insoluble. T11 and T2 were obtained from the supernatant of homogenized tissue and purified by the technique described here. T3, bound to particulate material, was separated from the supernatant of the homogenate; it can be partially solubilized with detergent, as described elsewhere. The final preparations of T1 and T2 were judged to be free from contamination with other proteins because their elution profiles from preparative polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis were symmetrical; the specific activity of their elution fractions was consistently high; the pattern of enzymic bands corresponded to that of protein bands after analytical polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under at least three different conditions of running pH or in gels of varied acrylamide content; and, in equilibrium ultracentrifugation experiments, the plot of the logarithm of the net fringe displacement versus the comparator x-coordinate was a straight line. T1 and T2 were found to have similar molecular weights (66,000 and 56,700, respectively) as determined by equilibrium ultracentrifugation, they differed in amino acid composition, and they did not appear to undergo interconversion. As determined from optical rotatory dispersion and circular dichroism spectra, the apparent α-helical content of T1 and T2 was approximately 28% and the helical configuration was resistant to changes of temperature. Concurrent studies revealed that enzymic activity was much more sensitive than helical configuration to temperature change. When T1 and T2 were treated with dithiothreitol and the excess dithiothreitol was removed, their enzymic activity was reduced or entirely lost; it was partially restored or augmented by placing the enzyme preparation in an environment favorable to oxidation. During reduction and reoxidation, T1 and T2 appeared to retain their characteristic, initial electrophoretic mobility. As determined spectrophotometrically and manometrically, neither form of soluble, purified tyrosinase was activated by chlorpromazine. Small quantities of active tyrosinases with a molecular weight of approximately 30,000 were obtained from melanoma by Sephadex column chromatography. Also, the amino acid content of the enzymes prepared in this way was about half that of the T1 and T2 prepared by preparative polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The more abundant and possibly more stable forms, T1 and T2, may, therefore, be dimers. The enzymes prepared by Sephadex column chromatography were judged to be free from contamination both because the specific activity of the fractions of each elution profile was high and did not change as the result of additional physical and chemical treatment, and because the sedimentation pattern showed a single, symmetrical peak."

The toxins are essentially homogeneous by free boundary electrophoresis and amino acid analyses. Toxins α and β have electrophoretic mobilities (ascending) of 3.58 x 10-5 and 5.95 x 10-5 at pH 8.4 and 5.34 x 10-5 and 9.49 x 10-5 cm2 s-1 volt-1 at pH 5.0, respectively. The formula weights of these three toxins are 7897, 6973, and 6834, respectively. Toxin α consists of 71 amino acid residues and is cross-linked by five disulfide bridges, while toxins β and δ contain 61 amino acid residues with four disulfide bridges each. Toxin α is immunochemically distinct from toxins β and δ while the latter two toxins are immunochemically related. Toxin δ was found to have the same amino acid sequence as toxin α from Naja haje haje venom."

https://openalex.org/W1562637415,"Abstract O antigen 122 in Salmonella is determined by short branches of the O side chain portion of the cell wall lipopolysaccharide. These branches consist of nonreducing terminal α-d-glucose residues linked to the C-4 position of the d-galactose residues of the main chain (Tinelli and Staub, Bull. Soc. Chim. Biol., 42, 601 (1960)). Particulate fractions from permanently 122-positive strains of Salmonella typhimurium incorporated d-glucose residues from UDP-glucose into endogenous lipopolysaccharide, and most of the incorporated d-glucose residues appeared to be linked to the O side chain d-galactose through the α(1→4) linkage. Particulate fractions from permanently 122-negative strains incorporated much less d-glucose. Examination of the time course of the reaction showed that the reaction involved two steps. UDP-glucose + lipid ⇄ glucose-lipid + UDP glucose-lipid + lipopolysaccharide glucosyllipopolysaccharide + (lipid) The first reaction was studied by use of a mutant (isolated from a permanently 122-positive strain) which synthesized an incomplete lipopolysaccharide and therefore could not carry out the second reaction. It required Mn++ or Mg++, and the use of 32P, 3H-doubly labeled UDP-glucose established that only the d-glucose moiety was transferred to the endogenous lipid. The reaction was reversible, and the formation of UDP-glucose-14C from partially purified 14C-glucose-lipid and UDP has been demonstrated. The forward reaction was inhibited by UDP, but not by UMP. The second reaction was exhibited by incubating the extracted 14C-glucose-lipid with a particulate fraction from a permanently 122-positive strain. In contrast to the first reaction, this reaction did not require the presence of divalent cations."
https://openalex.org/W2011906789,"Biosynthesis of thyrotropin-releasing hormone (L-pyroglutamyl-L-histidyl-L-proline amide) in vitro was studied. Rat hypothalamic fragments were incubated in Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer that contained either (14)C-labeled proline, histidine, or glutamic acid (the three probable precursor amino acids,) and for control purposes each of 16 other naturally occurring amino acids. A number of labeled peptides were synthesized. With the use of synthetic thyrotropin-releasing hormone, detected by the Pauly reagent or with (125)1-labeled thyrotropin-releasing hormone as a marker, thin-layer chromatograms, paper electrophoresis, and carboxymethyl cellulose ion exchange chromatography revealed that only proline, histidine, and glutamic acid were consistently incorporated into peptides associated with the thyrotropin-releasing hormone region. This synthesizing activity was found in stalk median eminence, ventral hypothalamus. and dorsal hypothalamus but not in neural lobe or cerebral cortex. Because the biosynthetic peptide has identical properties with L-pyroglutamyl-L-histidyl-L-proline amide, it is probable that rat thyrotropin-releasing hormone is similar or identical to both bovine and porcine thyrotropin-releasing hormone and that the native material is present in the pyroglutamyl form in tissues."
https://openalex.org/W1504555897,"Homogeneous carbonic anhydrase has been prepared from erythrocytes of the bull and tiger shark. Molecular and equivalence weight determinations indicate molecular weights in the range of 36,000 to 40,000 depending on the method employed. Amino acid compositions are similar to those reported for mammalian carbonic anhydrases with several notable exceptions. The bull and tiger shark enzymes contain ∼25 and 18 half-cystine residues per molecule, respectively. These residues are apparently present as disulfide cross-links, since neither the native nor denatured molecules react with sulfhydryl reagents, but do react after reduction with mercaptoethanol. There are high contents of glutamic and aspartic acid compatible with the very acidic nature of these proteins. The isoelectric point of the bull shark enzyme is ∼pH 4.5. The shark enzymes catalyze both the hydration of CO2 and the hydrolysis of certain aromatic esters. Maximal catalytic rates are comparable to the high activity forms of mammalian carbonic anhydrases. Aromatic sulfonamides are powerful inhibitors. Circular dichroic spectra in the ultraviolet region indicate the presence of many structural features similar to those found in the mammalian enzymes. The shark enzymes contain 1 g atom of zinc per mole of enzyme. A stable metal-free, inactive apoenzyme can be prepared which is completely reactivated by Zn(II) or Co(II) ions. The Co(II) derivatives have intense visible absorption maxima at 510, 555, 618, and 645 nm. These spectra, as well as the spectra of sulfonamide complexes of the Co(II) enzymes, are almost identical with those of the Co(II) derivatives of mammalian carbonic anhydrases, and suggest that similar coordination geometries exist at the active centers of the elasmobranch and mammalian enzymes. Since fossil morphological evidence suggests that present day shark species have not evolved much since the Devonian period, this particular type of metal complex would appear to have been a constant feature of carbonic anhydrase over 400 million years of animal evolution."
https://openalex.org/W1518772252,"Abstract A method is described by which liquid isoelectric focusing over a pH range 5 to 8 has been used on a preparative scale for the further purification of specifically purified antibodies directed against the positively charged p-azophenyltrimethylammonium hapten (anti-Ap antibodies). The anti-Ap antibodies separated into 4 to 8 major fractions and 10 to 16 minor fractions. More than 95% of the antibodies directed against the positively charged hapten had isoelectric points between pH 5 and 8. The charge, structural, and functional homogeneity of several of the major fractions was assessed by a number of independent criteria. The charge homogeneity of three of the electrofocused antibody fractions was demonstrated by the presence of monodisperse zones in electrophoresis, by focusing the major fractions over a narrow pH range, and also by acrylamide disc electrophoresis of fully reduced and alkylated light chains in alkaline urea gels. The structural homogeneity of two of the electrofocused antibody fractions was demonstrated by the finding of single NH2-terminal residues on the isolated, fully reduced and alkylated light chains. Sequence studies on the isolated light chains of these fractions showed each to have a single coherent sequence compared with the parent antibody which was typically heterogeneous. These antibody fractions showed only the b4 allotypic marker on their light chains and 95 to 96% of the heavy chains contained the a1 allotypic marker, although the unfractionated antibodies were heterozygous (a1, a3) with respect to the heavy chain allotypic markers. The functional homogeneity of these electrofocused antibody fractions was determined by equilibrium dialysis using the 125I-labelled p-iodophenyltrimethylammonium hapten. The results of the binding plots, using both the Scatchard and Sips analyses, demonstrated that the specifically purified anti-Ap antibodies had a heterogeneity index of 0.6 and contained 2 moles of combining sites per mole protein, while each of the electrofocused anti-Ap antibody fractions had a heterogeneity index of 1.0 and contained 2 moles of combining sites per mole protein."

https://openalex.org/W1485892674,"Abstract The activity of chorismate mutase plays a strategic role in mediating the flow of chorismate between the synthesis of tyrosine and phenylalanine on the one hand, and of tryptophan and a number of aromatic vitamins on the other hand. A gene specifying chorismate mutase in strain 23 of Bacillus subtilis was introduced into the genetic background of strain 168 by deoxyribonucleate transformation. The newly introduced chorismate mutase has a specific activity which is 10 times greater than that of strain 168. This hybrid strain was used to study the effect of the altered activity of chorismate mutase upon the routing of common pathway precursors into the divergent terminal branches of the aromatic amino acid pathway of biosynthesis. 1. Compared to strain 168, the hybrid strain (carrying chorismate mutase-H) was more resistant to growth inhibition by low concentrations of d-tyrosine and less resistant to growth inhibition by low concentrations of 5-methyltryptophan. The hybrid strain was resistant to a weak inhibition of growth which may occur in derivatives of strain 168 in the presence of the combination of tryptophan and tyrosine. The hybrid strain also possesses an increased capacity for incorporation of exogenous shikimate. 2. Chorismate mutase was product-inhibited by prephenate, a finding which we suggest is physiologically significant—a part of the pattern of sequential feedback inhibition which regulates the aromatic pathway in B. subtilis. 3. The considerable ability of the hybrid strain to adjust to the unbalancing influence of chorismate mutase-H is attributed to the compensatory capabilities of allosteric and repressive controls existing in the pathway. Accordingly, when these regulatory controls in the terminal branches of the pathway were lost by mutation, the full potential of an alteration in level of chorismate mutase to unbalance the flow of common precursors to the terminal branches of the pathway was unmasked. The dependence of the aromatic pathway in B. subtilis upon the regulatory enzymes in its terminal branches for the appropriate function of chorismate mutase leads us to describe this chorismate mutase as an example of a subordinate enzyme. 4. Hybrid strains of B. subtilis are widely distributed, often inadvertently. The properties of hybrid strains explain a number of findings in the literature."

Physical properties and amino acid composition have been determined indicating the enzyme to have a molecular weight of 65,000 ± 2,000 with a high content of aspartic and glutamic acid. Kinetic constants for the hydrolysis of a series of substituted phenyl sulfate esters at pH 4.0 and 7.5 have been determined. Plots of log Vmax/Km and log Vmax against pKa show that, as the electron-withdrawing ability of the substituent increases, log Vmax/Km increases with decreasing pKa, while log Vmax is independent of pKa. These results are interpreted in terms of a covalent sulfuryl enzyme intermediate or a rate-determining conformational change."

Cells previously incubated in sugar-free medium containing cycloheximide subsequently produced System II when transferred to a medium containing repressive concentrations of glucose. The presence of glucose during prior incubation in cycloheximide prevented synthesis of System II during the recovery phase. Synthesis was insensitive to actinomycin D during recovery. Both the rate of synthesis and the amount of System II synthesized increased with the duration (for 40 min) of cycloheximide previous treatment. The capacity of the cell to synthesize System II decreased with a half-life of 50 min during incubation of the cells in cycloheximide and glucose. During translation, the capacity to synthesize System II decayed with a half-life of 8.4 min. The data are consistent with the notion that mRNA specific for System II was synthesized and accumulated during starvation in cycloheximide. Accumulation of mRNA can be explained by the increased half-life of the message observed when translation was blocked by cycloheximide treatment."

https://openalex.org/W1550776041,"Abstract During sporulation, the processes of septation and envelopment create a double membraned structure (the forespore) which is destined to become the spore. In this paper we present biochemical data to support the hypothesis that septation and envelopment result from the continued synthesis of plasma membrane in the absence of cell wall synthesis. Using a double auxotroph of Bacillus megaterium requiring both diaminopimelic acid and lysine, it has been possible to follow mucopeptide formation unambiguously by measuring incorporation of radioactive diaminopimelic acid. Membrane synthesis has been determined by measuring the incorporation of (14C)-ethanolamine or (14C)-acetate into phospholipid. Upon glucose exhaustion and the initiation of sporulation, vegetative cell mucopeptide synthesis ceased for a period of 3 hours. Approximately 1 hour after the cessation of mucopeptide synthesis, an accelerated rate of phospholipid synthesis was observed that continued for about 3 hours. This biochemical data was correlated with morphological changes observed during the initial stages of sporulation."

Bug infestation in the low standard dwellings which are characteristic of urban and rural foci of the disease is usually discovered by daytime search for bugs in the cracks and crevices of walls and other indoor surfaces where the insects hide during the day. Pyrethrum powder is often blown into such fissures to irritate the bugs and cause them to emerge1, and some workers also sample by attaching perforated boxes containing crumpled paper to walls, when the chance lodgment of bugs in the boxes may indicate infestation2. The economic management of vector control requires more reliable and less time-consuming sampling methods3 and there is also a need for better quantitative data on bug densities in relation to clinical and epidemiological aspects of the disease."

https://openalex.org/W1486210813,"Abstract A study has been made of factors which alter the activities of bovine liver aconitase. Activities studied were the conversion of isocitrate to cis-aconitate, isocitrate to citrate, and citrate to cis-aconitate. The maximum rates of these reactions are increased approximately 150, 50, and 0%, respectively, if the enzyme preparation, containing no detectable citrate, is aged for 18 to 20 hours at 4°. The same changes in the rates of reaction are observed in the presence of Cu++, 10-6 m, in 4 hours. When the enzyme preparation contained 3.0 µm citrate or 4 mm 1,2,3-propane tricarboxylic acid, activation by aging of the conversion of isocitrate to cis-aconitate did not occur. No change in the polyacrylamide gel electrophoretic pattern was observed upon aging of the enzyme even though activity of the preparation increased markedly. The degree of activation of aconitase has been found to be important in relation to observed inhibition of its activities. Prior to activation, the activities of aconitase were inhibited specifically by preliminary incubation with bicarbonate or fructose-6-P. The conversion of isocitrate to cis-aconitate was inhibited 58% in the presence of 47 mm bicarbonate while the conversion of citrate to cis-aconitate was inhibited more than 90%. Fructose-6-P inhibited the conversion of isocitrate to cis-aconitate by aconitase in a manner similar to bicarbonate. After activation, the conversion of isocitrate to cis-aconitate was not inhibited by bicarbonate or fructose-6-P. These results show the differential activation and inhibition of the activities of aconitase and provide evidence for the inhibition of aconitase specifically by bicarbonate and fructose-6-P."
