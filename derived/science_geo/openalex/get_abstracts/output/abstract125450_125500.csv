https://openalex.org/W2113585222,"Field observations and satellite geodesy indicate that little crustal shortening has occurred along the central to southern margin of the eastern Tibetan plateau since about 4 million years ago. Instead, central eastern Tibet has been nearly stationary relative to southeastern China, southeastern Tibet has rotated clockwise without major crustal shortening, and the crust along portions of the eastern plateau margin has been extended. Modeling suggests that these phenomena are the result of continental convergence where the lower crust is so weak that upper crustal deformation is decoupled from the motion of the underlying mantle. This model also predicts east-west extension on the high plateau without convective removal of Tibetan lithosphere and without eastward movement of the crust east of the plateau."
https://openalex.org/W2011925577,"Ceramide is a sphingolipid that is generated in the signaling of inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF), which exerts many functional roles depending on the cell type where it is produced. Since TNF cytotoxicity is mediated by overproduction of reactive oxygen species from mitochondria, we have examined the role of ceramide in generation of oxidative stress in isolated rat liver mitochondria. The present studies demonstrate that addition of N-acetylsphingosine (C2-ceramide) to mitochondria led to an increase of fluorescence of dihydrorhodamine 123 or dichlorofluorescein-stained mitochondria, indicating formation of hydrogen peroxide. Such effect was significant at 0.25 μM and maximal at 1-5 μM C2, decreasing at greater concentrations. This inductive effect of ceramide was mimicked by N-hexanoylsphingosine at the same concentration range, whereas the immediate precursor of C2, C2-dihydroceramide increased hydrogen peroxide at 1-5 μM. Sphingosine generated hydrogen peroxide at concentrations ≥10 μM, whereas diacylglycerol failed to increase hydrogen peroxide. The increase in hydrogen peroxide induced by C2 was not triggered by mitochondrial permeability transition as C2 did not induce mitochondrial swelling. Blocking electron transport chain at complex I and II prevented the increase in hydrogen peroxide induced by C2; however, interruption of electron flow at complex III by antimycin A potentiated the inductive effect of C2. Depletion of matrix GSH prior to exposure to ceramide resulted in a potentiated increase (2-fold) of hydrogen peroxide generation, leading to lipid peroxidation and loss of activity of respiratory chain complex IV compared with GSH-repleted mitochondria. Mitochondria isolated from TNF-treated cells showed an increase (2-3-fold) in the amount of ceramide compared with mitochondria from untreated cells. These results suggest that mitochondria are a target of ceramide produced in the signaling of TNF whose effect on mitochondrial electron transport chain leads to overproduction of hydrogen peroxide and consequently this phenomena may account for the generation of reactive oxygen species during TNF cytotoxicity.

TNF exerts a pleiotropic mode of action on multiple cell functions including regulation of immune responses, host defense reactions, and gene regulation. In addition, its role as a mediator of cytotoxicity on certain susceptible transformed cell lines has been well documented (4Brach M.A. Gruss H.J. Asano Y. DeVos S. Ludwig W.D. Mertelsmann R.

Kronke M. Brach M.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1156-1165Google Scholar). Upon binding to its receptor subtypes, TNF evokes a complicated array of intracellular signals, including G-coupled activation of phospholipase A2, release of arachidonic acid, DAG production, and activation of protein kinase C, some of which may participate in the chain of reactions that result in cell killing (5Elbaz O.

An overproduction of ROS has been proposed as an important mechanism to mediate the cytotoxic and gene regulating effects that TNF exerts on tumor cells (8Jones A.L. Selby P. Cancer Surv. 1989; 8: 817-836Google Scholar,9Schulze-Ostholl K. Beyaert R. Vandevoorde V. Haegeman G. Fiers W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5317-5323Google Scholar, 10Schulze-Oshoff K. Bakker A.C.

Biophys. 1992; 294: 223-229Google Scholar).Ceramide has attracted considerable attention due to its role as an intracellular effector molecule that mimics some of the biological effects exerted by inflammatory cytokines such as TNF (13Kolesnick R. Golde D.W. Cell. 1994; 77: 325-328Google Scholar, 14Kolesnick R. Fuks Z. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 1949-1952Google Scholar, 15Hannun Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3125-3128Google Scholar, 16Zhang Y. Kolesnick R. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 4157-4160Google Scholar, 17Hannun Y.A. Bell R.M. Science. 1989; 243: 500-507Google Scholar, 18Spiegel S. Merrill A.H. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 188-1397Google Scholar). In addition to its de novo biosynthesis, which is initiated by the condensation of serine and palmitoyl-CoA, ceramide can also be generated by sphingomyelin hydrolysis. Thus, enzymes that hydrolyze sphingomyelin such as sphingomyelinases stand as regulators of intracellular ceramide levels and consequently ceramide-mediated functions. These enzymes are key components of the so-called sphingomyelin pathway, an ubiquitous system that functions in transducing the signals of cytokines to the cell interior (13Kolesnick R. Golde D.W. Cell. 1994; 77: 325-328Google Scholar, 14Kolesnick R. Fuks Z. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 1949-1952Google Scholar, 15Hannun Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3125-3128Google Scholar).Sphingomyelinase is known to exist in two forms depending on their intracellular localization and pH optima (13Kolesnick R. Golde D.W. Cell. 1994; 77: 325-328Google Scholar, 14Kolesnick R. Fuks Z. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 1949-1952Google Scholar, 15Hannun Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3125-3128Google Scholar, 16Zhang Y. Kolesnick R. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 4157-4160Google Scholar). A Mg2+-dependent membrane-bound with a neutral pH optima initiates signaling by generating ceramide at or near the vicinity of the plasma membrane. In addition to the membrane-associated enzyme, another cytosolic neutral SMase independent of Mg2+ has been identified and partially purified, which appears to hydrolyze intracellular sphingomyelin stores to initiate signaling (19Okazaki T. Bielawska A. Domal N. Bell R.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4070-4077Google Scholar). The signal initiated by these enzymes is then transmitted further down in the signaling cascade by activation of ceramide-activated protein phosphatases and ceramide-dependent protein kinases (13Kolesnick R. Golde D.W. Cell. 1994; 77: 325-328Google Scholar, 14Kolesnick R. Fuks Z. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 1949-1952Google Scholar, 15Hannun Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3125-3128Google Scholar). In addition to the neutral SMase forms, an acidic SMase form has also been identified, displaying an pH optima around 5, the bulk of which seems to be located at the lysosomes/endosomal compartment. Although it appears that acidic SMase plays a role in signaling, the molecular mechanism of its activation and recruitment during signaling is unclear. Indirect evidence have suggested that DAG generated by PC-PLC activates the acidic enzyme at or near the plasma membrane since inhibitors of PC-PLC prevent activation of the acidic SMase. This hypothesis, which implies a redistribution of the enzyme from the lysosomal compartment to or near the plasma membrane, requires further verification (20Schütze S. Potthoff K. Machleidt T. Berkovic D. Wiegmann K. Kronke M. Cell. 1992; 71: 756-776Google Scholar,21Wiegmann K. Schütze S. Machleidt T. Witte D. Kronke M. Cell. 1994; 78: 1005-1015Google Scholar). Despite the existence of the neutral and acidic SMases, an alkaline form of the enzyme has been described recently, although its role in signaling remains to be defined (22Nyberg L. Duan R.D. Axelson J. Nilsson A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1300: 42-48Google Scholar).There is compelling evidence to propose ceramide as a second messenger in the sphingomyelin pathway similar to DAG in the glycerophospholipid pathway. The role that ceramide fulfills within the cell are numerous and of varied nature (13Kolesnick R. Golde D.W. Cell. 1994; 77: 325-328Google Scholar, 14Kolesnick R. Fuks Z. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 1949-1952Google Scholar, 15Hannun Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3125-3128Google Scholar, 16Zhang Y. Kolesnick R. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 4157-4160Google Scholar). It has been shown that ceramide plays a critical role in apoptosis, proliferation, cellular senescence, and gene regulation through activation of transcription factors such as NF-κB (20Schütze S. Potthoff K. Machleidt T. Berkovic D. Wiegmann K. Kronke M. Cell. 1992; 71: 756-776Google Scholar,21Wiegmann K. Schütze S. Machleidt T. Witte D. Kronke M. Cell. 1994; 78: 1005-1015Google Scholar). However, the possibility that ceramide may interact with mitochondria leading to production of ROS has not been documented to our knowledge, and constitutes the basis of the present report.Mitochondria are one of the most important cellular sources of ROS due to its quantitative consumption of molecular oxygen. Since ceramide appears as an important mediator of the effects elicited by TNF and due to the participation of mitochondria in the TNF-induced ROS production (9Schulze-Ostholl K. Beyaert R. Vandevoorde V. Haegeman G. Fiers W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5317-5323Google Scholar, 10Schulze-Oshoff K. Bakker A.C. Vanhaesebroeck B. Beyaert R. Jacob W.A. Fiers W. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3095-3104Google Scholar, 11Goosens V. Grooten J. De Vos K. Fiers W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8115-8119Google Scholar, 12Adamson G.M. Billings R.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 294: 223-229Google Scholar), the purpose of the present work was to analyze the effects of ceramide and other sphingolipids, on the production of hydrogen peroxide in isolated mitochondria from rat liver. Furthermore, since reduced GSH is the only defense provided to metabolize peroxides generated from the electron transport chain through GSH redox cycle (23Kaplowitz N. Aw T.Y. Ookhtens M. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1985; 25: 715-744Google Scholar), we determined the role of mitochondrial GSH in modulating the production of hydrogen peroxide and its consequences upon incubation of mitochondria with ceramide. Our studies demonstrate for the first time that addition of ceramide to mitochondria results in a dose-dependent increase in hydrogen peroxide, which is prevented when complex I and II of respiration are inhibited. Furthermore, mitochondria from TNF-treated hepatocytes displayed an increased level of ceramide supporting the role of ceramide as an intermediate in the TNF-induced ROS generation from mitochondria. Depletion of matrix GSH prior to exposure to ceramide results in an additional increase of hydrogen peroxide, which peroxidizes lipids from mitochondria resulting in loss of mitochondrial function. These results suggest that ceramide produced in the signaling of TNF is responsible, at least in part, for some of the TNF-induced cytotoxic effects.MATERIALS AND METHODSGSH, GSSG, ethacrynic acid, DAG, BSO, DEM, AA, rotenone, atractyloside, TTFA, SMase (Bacillus cereus), ceramide III, and sphinganine were obtained from Sigma. ATP, myxothiazol, and dithiothreitol were from Boehringer Mannheim. N-acetylsphingosine (C2-ceramide), N-hexanoylsphingosine (C6-ceramide), N-palmitoylsphingosine (C16-ceramide), sphingosine, and C2-dihydroceramide were purchased from Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA). DCFDA, DHR and cis-parinaric acid were obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) was purchased from Amersham. Escherichia coli diacylglycerol kinase was from Calbiochem. Recombinant human TNF-α (specific activity 2.7 × 107 units/mg of protein) was obtained from Promega.Isolation and Culture of HepatocytesHepatocytes were isolated as described previously, plated on rat tail collagen, and cultured in DMEM/F12 (24Fernández-Checa J.C. García-Ruiz C. Ookhtens M. Kaplowitz N. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 87: 397-405Google Scholar,25García-Ruiz C. Morales A. Ballesta A. Rodes J. Kaplowitz N. Fernández-Checa J.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 193-201Google Scholar). Cell numbers were determined using a Coulter counter, model multisizer II (Coulter Electronics) and verified by hemocytometer. Cell viability was determined by trypan blue exclusion and by the measurement in the medium of glutathione S-transferase.Fluorescence MicroscopyCultured hepatocytes in the presence or absence of TNF or ceramide were incubated with fluorescence probes DCFDA or DHR (2 μM) for 1 h, followed by washing to remove excess probes. To quantify the generation of peroxides by fluorescence microscopy, a Nikon Diaphot 300 (Tokyo, Japan) inverted microscope equipped with a CF Fluor 40× objective was used. Fluorescence intensity was detected using a 3CCD camera (model DXC-930P, Sony, Tokyo, Japan) with an attached MPU-F100P intensifier (Sony). Images were recorded on a SR-SS368E (JVC, Tokyo, Japan) video cassette recorder and analyzed with a PC computer equipped with 24-bit Movie Machine II graphics. The limits of the hepatocyte monolayer in the area of observation were traced by a clear field transillumination image. Thereafter, the mean fluorescence intensity of the delimited area was measured in the corresponding fluorescence image. Five random images were analyzed for every experimental condition. Values of fluorescence are the result of subtracting background fluorescence (measured in cultures in the absence of fluorescent probes) from the values obtained in each image referred to a grayscale (0-255).Preparation of Mitochondria and Incubation with CeramidesRat liver mitochondria were isolated by differential centrifugation (26Schnaitman C.A. Greenawalt J.W. J. Cell Biol. 1968; 33: 158-175Google Scholar). Enrichment of mitochondria was ascertained by the specific activity of succinic dehydrogenase found in mitochondria relative to that of homogenate. Mitochondrial integrity was determined by the acceptor control ratio as oxygen consumption in states 3 and 4 of respiration using a Clark oxygen electrode with glutamate/malate or succinate as substrates for respiratory sites for complex I or II as described previously (25García-Ruiz C. Morales A. Ballesta A. Rodes J. Kaplowitz N. Fernández-Checa J.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 193-201Google Scholar,27García-Ruiz C. Colell A. Morales A. Kaplowitz N. Fernández-Checa J.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 48: 825-834Google Scholar).Mitochondria were incubated in a shaker bath a 25°C under ambient air in the presence of mediators of TNF or inhibitors of respiratory complexes for up to 1 h as detailed in the figures. When fluorescence probes were present, incubation was carried out in the dark.Stock solutions of sphingolipids were made up in dimethyl sulfoxide and stored at −80°C under nitrogen; when added to aqueous reaction mixtures containing mitochondria, the final concentration of the carrier solvent did not exceed 0.5%. Control mitochondria contained only carrier solvent whose presence did not affect the fluorescence of DCF.Flow Cytometry Analysis of MitochondriaAll measurements of mitochondria fluorescence and side light scatter (SSC, 90° angle) were made for at least 10,000 events/test using a FACStar flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA). Data on mitochondrial fluorescence and light scatter were obtained using a 5-watt argon ion laser tuned at 488 nm and 250 milliwatts. Fluorescence of DCF from oxidation of DCFDA was measured through a 530-nm bandpass filter placed in front of the green photomultiplier tube using a four-decade log amplifier. The mean intensity of the green fluorescence caused by mitochondria incubated with DCF in the presence or absence of ceramide was determined using the Cell Quest software program and expressed as fluorescence channels (scale from 0 to 10,000 arbitrary units). Graphics were plotted using the Cell Quest software program (Becton Dickinson).Depletion of Mitochondrial GSHGSH was depleted in vitro by preincubation of mitochondria with DEM (0.2-0.8 mM) or ethacrynic acid (250 μM) for 10-15 min, followed by removal of the agent by washing (2-3 times). Alternatively, mitochondria depleted of GSH from rat liver were prepared by in vivo treatment with BSO (3 mmol/kg/day, intraperitoneal) for 4 days or chronically feeding ethanol in liquid diet for 4 weeks as described (25García-Ruiz C. Morales A. Ballesta A. Rodes J. Kaplowitz N. Fernández-Checa J.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 193-201Google Scholar,28Fernández-Checa J.C. Ookhtens M. Kaplowitz N. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 83: 1247-1252Google Scholar). These treatments decrease mitochondrial GSH to about 50% of control (data not shown). Reduced and oxidized GSH were determined by high performance liquid chromatography as described (24Fernández-Checa J.C. García-Ruiz C. Ookhtens M. Kaplowitz N. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 87: 397-405Google Scholar,25García-Ruiz C. Morales A. Ballesta A. Rodes J. Kaplowitz N. Fernández-Checa J.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 193-201Google Scholar).Determination of Hydrogen Peroxide and Lipid PeroxidationHydrogen peroxide measurement was determined spectrofluorometrically using DCFDA. Mitochondria were incubated with the fluorescent probe, 2 μM, in the absence or presence of ceramide or other electron transport inhibitors (see figure legends). Fluorescence was determined at 529 nm for emission and 503 nm for excitation, with slit widths of 10 and 5 nm, respectively (27García-Ruiz C. Colell A. Morales A. Kaplowitz N. Fernández-Checa J.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 48: 825-834Google Scholar,29Cathcart R. Schwiers E. Ames B.N. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 134: 111-116Google Scholar). Fluorescence of DCF was correlated with increasing concentrations of hydrogen peroxide allowing determination of hydrogen peroxide as described (27García-Ruiz C. Colell A. Morales A. Kaplowitz N. Fernández-Checa J.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 48: 825-834Google Scholar).Lipid peroxidation was determined by quenching of fluorescence of cis-parinaric acid as described previously (30Hedley E. Chow S. Cytometry. 1992; 13: 686-692Google Scholar). Mitochondria treated with C2 were incubated with parinaric acid (5 μg/ml) and fluorescence reading determined at 318 nm for excitation and 410 nm for emission, respectively.Measurement of Mitochondrial Membrane Permeability TransitionLarge amplitude swelling was measured spectrophotometrically by recording absorbance at 540 nm. An increase in mitochondrial swelling results in a decrease in optical density. Isolated rat liver mitochondria were suspended in a buffer consisting of 200 mM sucrose, 10 mM Tris-MOPS, 5 mM succinate, 1 mM potassium phosphate, 2 μM rotenone, 1 μg/ml oligomycin, 10 μM EGTA, pH 7.4, at 25°C. Ceramides (C2, C6, or C2DH) were added to mitochondrial suspension at 1-5 μM, and absorbance at 540 nm was determined at 25°C over time. Opening of the pore was induced by the adenine nucleotide translocator ligand atractyloside or by incubation of mitochondria with tert-butylhydroperoxide and Ca2+ and prevented by preincubation with cyclosporin A (5 μM) and trifluoperazine (100 μM).Determination of CeramideMitochondria from TNF-treated hepatocytes were isolated by Percoll gradient as described (25García-Ruiz C. Morales A. Ballesta A. Rodes J. Kaplowitz N. Fernández-Checa J.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 193-201Google Scholar). Ceramide was quantified by the diacylglycerol kinase assay as described previously (31Dressler K.A. Kolesnick R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14917-14921Google Scholar,32Van Veldhoven P.P. Bishop W.R. Bell R.M. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 183: 177-189Google Scholar). Lipids from mitochondria were extracted and dried under nitrogen and resuspended in 100 μl of 150 μg of cardiolipin, 280 μM diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid, 51 mM octyl-β-glucopyranoside, 50 mM NaCl, 51 mM imidazole, 1 mM EDTA, 12.5 mM MgCl2, 2 mM dithiothreitol, 0.7% glycerol, 70 μMβ-mercaptoethanol, 1 mM ATP, 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and 35 μg/ml E. coli diacylglycerol kinase at pH 6.5. After 30 min at room temperature, the reaction was stopped by extraction of lipids with 1 ml of chloroform:methanol:1 N HCl (100:100:1) and 170 μl of PBS. Major lipid products of the phosphorylation reaction, phosphatidic acid (from diacylglycerol) and ceramide 1-phosphate (from ceramide) were resolved by thin-layer chromatography on Silica Gel 60 plates (Whatman) using chloroform:acetone:methanol:acetic acid:water (10:4:2:2:1, v/v) as solvent and detected by autoradiography. Incorporated 32P was quantitated by liquid scintillation counting. The level of ceramide was calculated by comparison with a standard curve generated using known amounts of ceramide type III.Statistical AnalysesStatistical analyses for comparison of mean values for multiple comparisons between mitochondrial preparations were made by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Fisher's test.

Golde D.W. Cell. 1994; 77: 325-328Google Scholar, 14Kolesnick R. Fuks Z. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 1949-1952Google Scholar, 15Hannun Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3125-3128Google Scholar, 16Zhang Y.

FASEB J. 1996; 10: 188-1397Google Scholar). In addition to its de novo biosynthesis, which is initiated by the condensation of serine and palmitoyl-CoA, ceramide can also be generated by sphingomyelin hydrolysis. Thus, enzymes that hydrolyze sphingomyelin such as sphingomyelinases stand as regulators of intracellular ceramide levels and consequently ceramide-mediated functions. These enzymes are key components of the so-called sphingomyelin pathway, an ubiquitous system that functions in transducing the signals of cytokines to the cell interior (13Kolesnick R. Golde D.W. Cell. 1994; 77: 325-328Google Scholar, 14Kolesnick R. Fuks Z. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 1949-1952Google Scholar, 15Hannun Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3125-3128Google Scholar).Sphingomyelinase is known to exist in two forms depending on their intracellular localization and pH optima (13Kolesnick R. Golde D.W. Cell. 1994; 77: 325-328Google Scholar, 14Kolesnick R. Fuks Z. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 1949-1952Google Scholar, 15Hannun Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3125-3128Google Scholar, 16Zhang Y. Kolesnick R. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 4157-4160Google Scholar). A Mg2+-dependent membrane-bound with a neutral pH optima initiates signaling by generating ceramide at or near the vicinity of the plasma membrane. In addition to the membrane-associated enzyme, another cytosolic neutral SMase independent of Mg2+ has been identified and partially purified, which appears to hydrolyze intracellular sphingomyelin stores to initiate signaling (19Okazaki T. Bielawska A. Domal N. Bell R.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4070-4077Google Scholar). The signal initiated by these enzymes is then transmitted further down in the signaling cascade by activation of ceramide-activated protein phosphatases and ceramide-dependent protein kinases (13Kolesnick R. Golde D.W. Cell. 1994; 77: 325-328Google Scholar, 14Kolesnick R. Fuks Z. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 1949-1952Google Scholar, 15Hannun Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3125-3128Google Scholar). In addition to the neutral SMase forms, an acidic SMase form has also been identified, displaying an pH optima around 5, the bulk of which seems to be located at the lysosomes/endosomal compartment."
https://openalex.org/W2036424054,"Cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure caused by high blood pressure were studied in single myocytes taken from hypertensive rats (Dahl SS/Jr) and SH-HF rats in heart failure. Confocal microscopy and patch-clamp methods were used to examine excitation-contraction (EC) coupling, and the relation between the plasma membrane calcium current (ICa) and evoked calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), which was visualized as ""calcium sparks."" The ability of ICa to trigger calcium release from the SR in both hypertrophied and failing hearts was reduced. Because ICa density and SR calcium-release channels were normal, the defect appears to reside in a change in the relation between SR calcium-release channels and sarcolemmal calcium channels. beta-Adrenergic stimulation largely overcame the defect in hypertrophic but not failing heart cells. Thus, the same defect in EC coupling that develops during hypertrophy may contribute to heart failure when compensatory mechanisms fail."
https://openalex.org/W1978027717,"Microfluidic networks (μFNs) were used to pattern biomolecules with high resolution on a variety of substrates (gold, glass, or polystyrene). Elastomeric μFNs localized chemical reactions between the biomolecules and the surface, requiring only microliters of reagent to cover square millimeter–sized areas. The networks were designed to ensure stability and filling of the μFN and allowed a homogeneous distribution and robust attachment of material to the substrate along the conduits in the μFN. Immunoglobulins patterned on substrates by means of μFNs remained strictly confined to areas enclosed by the network with submicron resolution and were viable for subsequent use in assays. The approach is simple and general enough to suggest a practical way to incorporate biological material on technological substrates."
https://openalex.org/W2042068133,"Circadian rhythmicity is universally associated with the ability to perceive light, and the oscillators (“clocks”) giving rise to these rhythms, which are feedback loops based on transcription and translation, are reset by light. Although such loops must contain elements of positive and negative regulation, the clock genes analyzed to date— frq in Neurospora and per and tim in Drosophila —are associated only with negative feedback and their biochemical functions are largely inferred. The white collar–1 and white collar–2 genes, both global regulators of photoresponses in Neurospora , encode DNA binding proteins that contain PAS domains and are believed to act as transcriptional activators. Data shown here suggest that wc-1 is a clock-associated gene and wc-2 is a clock component; both play essential roles in the assembly or operation of the Neurospora circadian oscillator. Thus DNA binding and transcriptional activation can now be associated with a clock gene that may provide a positive element in the feedback loop. In addition, similarities between the PAS-domain regions of molecules involved in light perception and circadian rhythmicity in several organisms suggest an evolutionary link between ancient photoreceptor proteins and more modern proteins required for circadian oscillation."

https://openalex.org/W1487661416,"The neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) tumor suppressor protein is thought to restrict cell proliferation by functioning as a Ras-specific guanosine triphosphatase–activating protein. However, Drosophila homozygous for null mutations of an NF1 homolog showed no obvious signs of perturbed Ras1-mediated signaling. Loss of NF1 resulted in a reduction in size of larvae, pupae, and adults. This size defect was not modified by manipulating Ras1 signaling but was restored by expression of activated adenosine 3′,5′-monophosphate–dependent protein kinase (PKA). Thus, NF1 and PKA appear to interact in a pathway that controls the overall growth of Drosophila."

Results from a process-based vegetation model show how montane vegetation in East Africa shifts with changes in both carbon dioxide concentration and climate. For the last glacial maximum, the change in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration alone could explain the observed replacement of tropical montane forest by a scrub biome. This result implies that estimates of the last glacial maximum tropical cooling based on tree- line shifts must be revised."
https://openalex.org/W2038561872,"The human neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) tumor suppressor protein functions as a Ras-specific guanosine triphosphatase-activating protein, but the identity of Ras- mediated pathways modulated by NF1 remains unknown. A study of Drosophila NF1 mutants revealed that NF1 is essential for the cellular response to the neuropeptide PACAP38 (pituitary adenylyl cyclase-activating polypeptide) at the neuromuscular junction. The peptide induced a 100-fold enhancement of potassium currents by activating the Ras-Raf and adenylyl cyclase-adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cAMP) pathways. This response was eliminated in NF1 mutants. NF1 appears to regulate the rutabaga-encoded adenylyl cyclase rather than the Ras-Raf pathway. Moreover, the NF1 defect was rescued by the exposure of cells to pharmacological treatment that increased concentrations of cAMP."
https://openalex.org/W2143786004,"The 14-3-3 proteins have been implicated as potential regulators of diverse signaling pathways. Here, using two-hybrid assays and in vitro assays of protein interaction, we show that the ϵ isoform of 14-3-3 interacts with the insulin-like growth factor I receptor (IGFIR) and with insulin receptor substrate I (IRS-1), but not with the insulin receptor (IR). Coprecipitation studies demonstrated an IGFI-dependent in vitro interaction between 14-3-3-glutathione S-transferase proteins and the IGFIR. In similar studies no interaction of 14-3-3 with the IR was observed. We present evidence to suggest that 14-3-3 interacts with phosphoserine residues within the COOH terminus of the IGFIR. Specifically, peptide competition studies combined with mutational analysis suggested that the 14-3-3 interaction was dependent upon phosphorylation of IGFIR serine residues 1272 and/or 1283, a region which has been implicated in IGFIR-dependent transformation. Phosphorylation of these serines appears to be dependent upon prior IGFIR activation since no interaction of 14-3-3 was observed with a kinase-inactive IGFIR in the two-hybrid assay nor was any in vitro interaction with unstimulated IGFIR derived from mammalian cells. We show that the interaction of 14-3-3 with IRS-1 also appears to be phosphoserine-dependent. Interestingly, 14-3-3 appears to interact with IRS-1 before and after hormonal stimulation. In summary, our data suggest that 14-3-3 interacts with phosphoserine residues within the COOH terminus of the IGFIR and within the central domain of IRS-1.

Despite the apparently identical signaling events which are initiated by the IR and IGFIR via these signaling proteins, the primary physiological role of insulin is to regulate metabolic events, while IGFI primarily regulates cellular growth, differentiation, and transformation (7Rubin R. Baserga R. Lab. Invest. 1995; 73: 311-331Google Scholar). It is therefore likely that divergent signaling pathways exist that are responsible for mediating these different cellular effects. Several studies have suggested the existence of such divergent pathways. First, receptor chimeras in which the cytoplasmic domain of the IGFIR was fused to the IR, were reported to have significantly increased mitogenic potential compared with the IR (8Lammers R. Gray A. Schlessinger J. Ullrich A. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1369-1375Google Scholar). Another study showed that the IR was incapable of mediating cellular transformation when expressed in cells derived from IGFIR-deficient mouse embryos, whereas the IGFIR was capable of mediating this response (9Miura M. Li S. Baserga R. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 663-667Google Scholar). Studies on signal divergence have largely focused on the COOH-terminal region of the receptors, since this region is the most disparate (10Faria T.N. Blakesley V.A. Kato H. Stannard B. LeRoith D.

These studies concluded that the COOH terminus of the IR was important for regulation of a variety of cellular effects but few conclusions regarding the role of the COOH terminus of the IGFIR were proposed. However, several studies have suggested a role for the COOH terminus of the IGFIR. For example, the region of the IGFIR between residues 1245 and 1310 has been implicated in transforming activity of the IGFIR (16Hongo A. D'Ambrosio C. Miura M. Morrione A. Baserga R. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1231-1238Google Scholar), and some studies have suggested that residues 1293-1294 and the tyrosine at position 1251 are involved in the transforming response (16Hongo A. D'Ambrosio C. Miura M. Morrione A. Baserga R. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1231-1238Google Scholar). A recent study showed that four serines within the COOH-terminal region of the IGFIR (1280-1283) were necessary for the transforming activity of the IGFIR, since a mutant IGFIR in which these serines were mutated to alanine was unable to transform cells (termed R− cells) which do not contain any endogenous IGFIR due to gene knockout via homologous recombination (17Li S. Resnicoff M. Baserga R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12254-12260Google Scholar). Since the IRS-1 and SHC signaling pathways were unaffected by these serine mutations it was proposed that this region of the IGFIR COOH terminus may activate an uncharacterized signaling pathway required for cellular transformation. insulin-like growth factor I receptor insulin receptor substrate 1 Src homology and collagen phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase Src homology 2 insulin receptor glutathione S-transferase polymerase chain reaction polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.

Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 498-501Google Scholar).

Together, these findings suggest a potential for 14-3-3 proteins in the regulation of mitogenesis or cellular transformation. The structure of the ζ and τ isoforms of 14-3-3 have recently been reported (29Xiao B. Smerdon S.J. Jones J.H. Dodson G.G. Soneji Y. Aitken A. Gamblin S.J. Nature. 1995; 376: 188-191Google Scholar, 30Liu D. Bienkowska J. Petosa C. Collier R.J. Fu H. Liddington R. Nature. 1995; 376: 191-194Google Scholar) revealing a number of interesting findings. First, as expected from previous biochemical studies, the 14-3-3 proteins form a dimer via interactions at the extreme NH2 terminus. Second, each monomer of 14-3-3 was found to have a large negatively charged channel which theoretically could serve to bind phosphorylated peptides. In support of this idea, it has been shown that 14-3-3 binds specifically to serine 621 within the Raf molecule in a phosphorylation-dependent manner (31Muslin A.J. Tanner J.W. Allen P.M. Shaw A.S. Cell. 1996; 84: 889-897Google Scholar). In this report, we examined the interaction between 14-3-3 and the insulin and IGFI receptors and IRS-1 using the yeast two-hybrid system and assays of in vitro protein interaction. We show that 14-3-3 interacts with the IGFIR, but not the insulin receptor, and that 14-3-3 also interacts with IRS-1. We demonstrate that serine-phosphorylated peptides corresponding either to the COOH-terminal region of the IGFIR or to the 14-3-3-binding site within Raf were able to compete the interaction of 14-3-3 with the IGFIR and IRS-1, whereas phosphotyrosine-containing peptides corresponding to known sites of tyrosine phosphorylation within the IGFIR had no effect upon either interaction. We show that an IGFIR mutant in which serines 1272 and 1280-1283 within the COOH terminus were mutated to alanine showed no interaction with 14-3-3 in the two-hybrid assay, but had no effect upon IGFIR interaction with IRS1, SHC, or p85. Taken together, these data suggest that 14-3-3 interacts with phosphoserine residues within the IGFIR COOH terminus. Since this region of the IGFIR has been shown to be necessary for IGFIR-dependent cellular transformation (17Li S. Resnicoff M. Baserga R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12254-12260Google Scholar, 32Surmacz E. Sell C. Swantek J. Kato H. Roberts C.T.J. LeRoith D. Baserga R. Exp. Cell. Res. 1995; 218: 370-380Google Scholar), it is possible that 14-3-3 is involved in mediating the transforming activity of the IGFIR. The yeast strain EGY40 and all yeast expression plasmids were provided by the laboratory of Roger Brent and have been previously described (33Golemis E.A. Brent R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3006-3014Google Scholar, 34Gyuris J. Golemis E. Chertkov H. Brent R. Cell. 1993; 75: 791-803Google Scholar, 35Zervos A.S. Gyuris J. Brent R. Cell. 1993; 72: 223-232Google Scholar). All routine growth and maintenance of yeast strains was as described (36Guthrie C. Fink G.R. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 194: 1-774Google Scholar). Plasmid transformation of yeast was by the lithium acetate method (37Schiestl R.H. Gietz R.D. Curr. Genet. 1989; 16: 339-346Google Scholar). The IR and IGFIR two-hybrid fusions and IGFIR K1003A mutant have been previously reported (38Craparo A. O'Neill T.J. Gustafson T.A. J. Biol.

Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6433-6442Google Scholar). The IGFIR receptor mutants (4S, S1272A, and 4S/S1272A) were made by site-directed mutagenesis according to the method of Kunkel (41Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Google Scholar). The chimeric receptors joined within the kinase domain were constructed using a conserved XmnI site within the amino terminus of the kinase domains. The COOH-terminal chimera was generated from the previously reported construct (10Faria T.N. Blakesley V.A. Kato H. Stannard B. LeRoith D. Roberts Jr., C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13922-13928Google Scholar) which was a gift from Derek LeRoith. To obtain the final 14-3-3 clone, we utilized PCR and amplified cDNA derived from RNA obtained from a cell line derived from a polyoma virus-induced mammary tumor. We used a 5′ PCR primer containing an EcoRI site and a 3′ primer with a BamHI site. The PCR primers were as follows: 5′-CCGGAATTCATGGATGATCGGGAGGATCTG-3′ and 5′-CGGGATCCCGTGATTCTCATCTTCCAC-3′. Note that the final amino acid (Gln-256) was inadvertently left off of this PCR-derived cDNA and thus our 14-3-3 protein contains only amino acids 1-255. The PCR product was first cloned into the pGBT9 vector (CLONTECH) as an EcoRI/BamHI fragment and subsequently transferred to the pJG4-5 interaction trap plasmid as an EcoRI/SalI fragment by cloning into the EcoRI/XhoI sites within the pJG4-5 plasmid. The 14-3-3 deletion constructs were generated by insertion of linkers into the following restriction sites: 1-203 (MunI), 1-184 (ApoI), 1-118 (StyI), and 118-255 (StyI). All two-hybrid and GST constructs were produced by standard methods and detailed cloning strategies are available upon request. The solution β-galactosidase assays were performed as described (42Breeden L. Nasmyth K. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1985; 50: 643-650Google Scholar) and the units of β-galactosidase activity were calculated by the method of Miller (43Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar). The values shown for the positive colonies represent the average of 3 assays (each assay representing an independent colony). GST fusion proteins were generated with 14-3-3 and an IRS-2 fragment which we have previously demonstrated to interact with the IR (44He W. Craparo A. Zhu Y. O'Neill T.J. Wang L.-M. Pierce J.H.

The lysates were then incubated with the immobilized GST proteins at 4°C overnight. After washing four times with 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.6), 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, the proteins that coprecipitated with 14-3-3 were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies (PY20, Transduction Labs), anti-IGFIR (IGFIR 1-2, a gift from Ken Siddle), or anti-IRS1 (UBI). Peptides were made which correspond either to the region of Raf which interacts with 14-3-3 or to the various regions of the IGFIR, both with or without serine or tyrosine phosphorylation. The peptides were added to both the immobilized 14-3-3 GST protein and the cellular lysates at concentrations of 0, 1, 5, 10, 50, and 100 μM for the Raf peptide competition, and at 100 μM for the IGFIR peptide competitions. Incubation of the GST with the cellular lysates and analysis of precipitated proteins are as outlined above. In addition to the serine-phosphorylated peptides shown in the figures herein, the following peptides which correspond to regions of the IGFIR were also tested (data not shown) either with or without phosphorylated tyrosine residues: juxtamembrane, GVLpYASVNPEpYFSAA; catalytic loop, NTRDIpYETDpYpYRKGG; and COOH terminus, RASFDERQPpYAHMNG.

We initially set out to examine the interaction of 14-3-3 with the polyoma middle T antigen (25Pallas D.C. Fu H. Haehel L.C. Weler W. Collier R.J. Roberts T.M. Science. 1994; 265: 535-537Google Scholar) using the two-hybrid system. Although we were unable to demonstrate an interaction between these proteins, 2R. Freund and T. A. Gustafson, unpublished data.we did note a strong interaction of 14-3-3 with the IGFIR in the yeast two-hybrid system. The results of our initial experiments are shown in Fig. 1A. In an attempt to identify the minimal domain of 14-3-3 which was sufficient to interact with the receptor, we made five constructs of the ϵ isoform of 14-3-3 and tested them for interaction with the insulin receptor or IGFIR in the two-hybrid system. We saw high levels of activity in both the colony color and solution assays with both full-length 14-3-3 and the 1-203 activation domain hybrids when tested against the IGFIR-LexA bait. Conversely, 14-3-3 showed no interaction with the insulin receptor in the two-hybrid system. A much lower amount of activity was seen with the 14-3-3 (1-184) activation domain hybrid and the IGFIR compared with full-length 14-3-3, and no interaction was detected with either the 1-118 or 118-255 constructs. We conclude that an important element for 14-3-3 binding to the IGFIR is located between amino acids 184 and 203 of 14-3-3, although this region by itself is insufficient for interaction. The inability of the COOH-terminally truncated 14-3-3 to interact with the receptor is consistent with the structure of 14-3-3, in which the COOH terminus of each of the protein monomers forms a binding groove which has been proposed to function as a protein-binding domain (29Xiao B. Smerdon S.J. Jones J.H. Dodson G.G. Soneji Y. Aitken A. Gamblin S.J. Nature. 1995; 376: 188-191Google Scholar, 30Liu D. Bienkowska J. Petosa C. Collier R.J. Fu H. Liddington R. Nature. 1995; 376: 191-194Google Scholar). We examined whether the interaction between 14-3-3 and IGFIR was dependent upon the kinase activity of the IGFIR by testing interaction with a kinase-inactive IGFIR in which the critical lysine (Lys-1003) has been mutated to alanine (denoted K1003A). We detected no interaction between any of the 14-3-3 activation domain hybrids and the kinase-dead mutant in the two-hybrid system. Since 14-3-3 interacts with the IGFIR, but not the insulin receptor, we constructed three chimeric receptors with regions of the insulin and IGFI receptor cytoplasmic domains and tested them for interaction with 14-3-3 in the two-hybrid system. We were able to detect interaction of 14-3-3 only with the chimeras which contained the COOH terminus of the IGFIR (Fig. 1B). We saw no interaction between 14-3-3 and either of two chimeras which contained the COOH-terminal region of the insulin receptor. Since the COOH-terminal chimera replaces the 107 carboxyl residues of the IGFIR with 99 amino acids derived from the IR (10Faria T.N. Blakesley V.A. Kato H. Stannard B. LeRoith D. Roberts Jr., C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13922-13928Google Scholar), we conclude that 14-3-3 requires the COOH-terminal 107 amino acids of the IGFIR for interaction. The COOH-terminal region of the IGFIR contains two tyrosines at position 1250 and 1251 which are not present on the insulin receptor and have been implicated in IGFIR signaling. Specifically, mutation of tyrosine 1251 to phenylalanine results in an IGFIR which is mitogenic, but unable to transform R− cells (16Hongo A. D'Ambrosio C. Miura M. Morrione A. Baserga R. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1231-1238Google Scholar). Although it is unclear whether or not these tyrosines are in fact phosphorylated in vivo, we hypothesized that 14-3-3 could be interacting with these tyrosines in a phosphorylation-dependent manner, since 14-3-3 did not interact with the kinase-inactive IGFIR. To test this, we made site-directed mutants in which either of these tyrosines was mutated to phenylalanine and tested them for interaction with 14-3-3 in the two-hybrid system. We saw undiminished levels of activity for interaction of both mutants with 14-3-3 (Fig. 1B), indicating that these tyrosines are not required for interaction with 14-3-3. To further examine the interaction between the IGFIR and 14-3-3, we generated a 14-3-3-GST fusion protein and used it to precipitate proteins from lysates derived from IGFI-stimulated or unstimulated IGFIR-overexpressing cells (47Peterson J.E. Jelinek T. Kaleko M. Siddle K. Weber M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27315-27321Google Scholar). The 14-3-3-GST fusion protein was able to precipitate phosphorylated IGFIR from rat1-IGFIR cells, as well as a second phosphorylated band of approximately 180 kDa (Fig. 2A, top panel, lane 4). As expected, the IRS-2 GST fusion protein was also able to precipitate the phosphorylated IGFIR from the rat1-IGFIR cell lysates (Fig. 2A, top panel, lane 2). In contrast, the 14-3-3-GST fusion protein was unable to precipitate any detectable IR from insulin-stimulated CHO-IR cell lysates, although it did interact with the higher molecular weight band seen in the rat1-IGFIR precipitates (Fig. 2A, bottom panel, lane 4). To determine whether the 95-kDa phosphoprotein precipitated from the rat1-IGFIR cellular lysates was the IGFIR, we probed an identical blot with antibodies to the IGFIR. The phosphorylated protein precipitated from rat1-IGFIR cells by both the IRS-2 and 14-3-3-GST proteins was indeed the IGFIR (Fig. 2B, lanes 2 and 4). The identity of the higher molecular weight band in the IGFIR immunoblots is unclear. We also probed an identical blot with antibodies to IRS-1, and determined that the larger phosphoprotein was at least in part IRS-1 (Fig. 2C). Interestingly, a larger amount of IRS-1 coprecipitated with the 14-3-3-GST fusion prior to stimulation of the cells with IGFI (Fig. 2C, compare lanes 5 and 6). No IRS-1 was detected in precipitates using GST alone (Fig. 2C, lanes 8 and 9). We also demonstrated a direct interaction between 14-3-3 and IRS-1 in the two-hybrid assay (Table I). Using human IRS-1-LexA fusion proteins as bait, we were able to detect significant interaction with 14-3-3. We were unable to utilize a full-length IRS-1 bait hybrid because of intrinsic activation of the reporter genes which caused expression of lacZ in the absence of an activation domain hybrid (not shown). However, the two IRS-1 bait fusions shown (45-516 and 516-865) did not autoactivate and were therefore useful for the two-hybrid assay. Both of these constructs showed some interaction with 14-3-3 in the colony color assay although the strongest interaction occurred with the hybrid protein containing amino acids 516-865.Table ITwo-hybrid interaction of 14-3-3 with IGFIR hybrids containing serine mutations and with IRS-1 domainsPreyColony colorA.

Collier R.J. Roberts T.M. Science. 1994; 266: 126-129Google Scholar), although the physiological role of this interaction remains unclear (50Morrison D. Science. 1994; 266: 56-57Google Scholar). Recently, one domain of Raf which interacts with 14-3-3 has been identified, and has been shown to be dependent upon serine phosphorylation of Raf (31Muslin A.J. Tanner J.W. Allen P.M. Shaw A.S. Cell. 1996; 84: 889-897Google Scholar). The recently reported crystallographic structure of 14-3-3 suggests the presence of a groove within 14-3-3 which forms a possible binding pocket for phosphorylated amino acids (29Xiao B. Smerdon S.J. Jones J.H. Dodson G.G. Soneji Y. Aitken A. Gamblin S.J. Nature. 1995; 376: 188-191Google Scholar, 30Liu D. Bienkowska J. Petosa C. Collier R.J. Fu H. Liddington R. Nature. 1995; 376: 191-194Google Scholar). We tested whether this same region of 14-3-3 might be responsible for the interaction of 14-3-3 with the IGFIR and/or IRS-1 by asking whether the interaction between 14-3-3 and either the IGFIR or IRS-1 could be blocked using phosphopeptides corresponding to the Raf-binding site (Fig. 3A). As shown in Fig. 3B, 14-3-3 interaction with both the IGFIR and IRS-1 was reduced by addition of the phosphorylated peptides in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 3B, left panel). No competition was seen when increasing amounts of unphosphorylated peptide were utilized (Fig. 3B, right panel). These data indicate that the IGFIR and IRS-1 interact with 14-3-3 at the same site as does Raf and also suggest that phosphoserine residues within the IGFIR and IRS-1 may also be necessary for interaction of 14-3-3. We next examined the possibility that 14-3-3 may interact with phosphoserine residues within the IGFIR COOH terminus. Using the Raf sequence as a guide"

It is limited principally by the breakdown of zero-resistive current due to thermally activated flux flow at high temperatures and high magnetic fields. One promising method to overcome this limitation is to introduce efficient pinning centers into crystals that can suppress the flux flow. A marked increase in Jc was observed in Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+delta (Bi-2212) single crystals doped with a large amount of Pb. By electron microscopy, characteristic microstructures were revealed that probably underlie the observed enhancement in Jc: thin (10 to 50 nanometers), platelike domains having a modulation-free structure appeared with spacings of 50 to 100 nanometers along the b axis."

In the present study, we not only demonstrated that human fetal mixed glial cultures, as well as enriched microglial cultures, synthesize iNOS and nitric oxide (NO) in response to cytokine stimulation, but also assessed the kinetics of iNOS and NO synthesis in human fetal mixed glial cultures. The iNOS mRNA was expressed within 2 h after stimulation and decreased to base line by 2 days. Significant levels of iNOS protein appeared within 24 h after stimulation and remained elevated during the culture period. A dramatic increase in NO production and NO-mediated events, such as the induction of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), NADPH diaphorase activity, and nitrotyrosine occurred 3 days after stimulation, a delay of 48 h from the time of the first expression of iNOS enzyme. This delay of NO production was altered by the addition of tetrahydrobiopterin, but not by the addition of L-arginine, heme, flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), flavin mononucleotide (FMN), or NADPH. These findings suggest that a post-translational regulatory event might be involved in iNOS-mediated NO production in human glia.

It is, however, controversial whether various ER ligands affect the receptor's ability to bind its specific DNA element (ERE).By using real time interaction analysis we have investigated the kinetics of human (h)ER binding to DNA in the absence and presence of 17β-estradiol, 17α-ethynyl estradiol, analogs of tamoxifen, raloxifene, and ICI-182,780. We show that ligand binding dramatically influences the kinetics of hER interaction with specific DNA. We have found that binding of estradiol induces the rapid formation of a relatively unstable ER·ERE complex, and binding of ICI-182,780 leads to slow formation (ka is approximately 10 times lower) of a stable receptor-DNA complex (kd is almost 2 orders of magnitude lower). Therefore, binding of estradiol accelerates the frequency of receptor-DNA complex formation more than 50-fold, compared with unliganded ER, and more than 1000-fold compared with ER liganded with ICI-182,780.

The regulation of programmed cell death is important for proper development and homeostasis in multicellular organisms (1Thompson C.B. Science. 1995; 267: 1456-1462Google Scholar, 2Steller H. Science. 1995; 267: 1445-1449Google Scholar). Genetic studies have demonstrated that programmed cell death is controlled by a cell death pathway, and several key genes in this pathway have been identified (3Hengartner M.O. Ellis R.E.

The bcl-2 family also encodes the proteins Bax and Bak that promote cell death and can antagonize the cell protective functions of Bcl-2 (14Oltvai Z.N. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J.

These Bcl-2 family members share significant sequence homology, particularly in regions known as BH1, BH2, and BH3 domains (18Chittenden T. Flemington C. Houghton A.B. Ebb R.G. Gallo G.J.

Bcl-2 family proteins have been shown to form a variety of protein-protein interactions, both homodimers and heterodimers. For example, Bcl-2 can homodimerize with itself as well as form heterodimers with Bax (20Yin X.-M. Oltvai Z.N. Korsmeyer S.J. Nature. 1994; 369: 321-333Google Scholar).

Mutagenesis studies have suggested that Bcl-2 family dimerization may be important for function. For example, the G145A mutation in the BH1 domain of Bcl-2 fails to heterodimerize with Bax and no longer can suppress apoptosis (20Yin X.-M. Oltvai Z.N. Korsmeyer S.J. Nature. 1994; 369: 321-333Google Scholar); similar results were observed with the homologous mutation in Bcl-xL (22Sedlak T.W. Oltvai Z.N. Yang E. Wang K. Boise L.H. Thompson C.B. Korsmeyer S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7834-7838Google Scholar). Interestingly, while several BH1 and BH2 mutants of Bcl-2 failed to heterodimerize with Bax, these mutations did not abrogate their ability to dimerize with wild-type Bcl-2 (20Yin X.-M. Oltvai Z.N. Korsmeyer S.J. Nature. 1994; 369: 321-333Google Scholar). This data, together with additional yeast two-hybrid data (19Zha H. Aime-Sempe C. Sato T. Reed J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7440-7444Google Scholar), has suggested that homodimer and heterodimer formation may reflect distinct binding processes utilizing distinct binding sites on the various molecules. In the present report, however, we use quantitative binding assays to demonstrate that homodimers and heterodimers are formed by interactions at the same sites. Two expression vectors were used to express human Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Bax in bacteria. In all cases, the C-terminal membrane spanning domain in these proteins was deleted. pGEX-4T-1 (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) was used for expression with N-terminal GST 1The abbreviations used are: GSTglutathione S-transferase6H6-histidinePBSphosphate-buffered salinePBS-TPBS + Tween 20BSAbovine serum albumin. tags. The construct for expression of GST-Bcl-2 coding for amino acids 1-218 of human Bcl-2 was a generous gift from John Reed (Burnham Institute). For the expression of GST-Bcl-xL, a fragment coding for amino acids 1-211 was obtained from a full-length Bcl-xL cDNA template by PCR with Pfu polymerase (Stratagene). The primer sequences were: 5′ AGT ATC GAA TTC ATG TCT CAG AGC AAC CGG 3′ and 5′ TAC AGT CTC GAG CTA GTT GAA GCG TTC CTG GCC CT 3′, with EcoRI as a 5′ cloning site and XhoI as a 3′ cloning site. pET-15b (Novagen) was used for the expression of proteins with N-terminal 6-histidine tags. For the expression of 6-histidine-Bcl-xL, a fragment coding for amino acids 1-211 was obtained by PCR. The fragment contains a 5′ NdeI site and 3′ XhoI site, as well as an additional C-terminal Glu-Glu-Phe epitope tag. The primer sequences were: 5′ ATC CGT CAT ATG TCT CAG AGC AAC CGG 3′ and 5′ TAC AGT CTC GAG TCA AAA TTC CTC GTT GAA GCG TTC CTG GCC 3′. 6-histidine-Bax (amino acids 1-170) was constructed in an analogous fashion but without a Glu-Glu-Phe tag with the following primers: 5′ ACG TAC CAT ATG GAC GGG TCC GGG GAG 3′ and 5′ TAC AGT CTC GAG CTA CCA CGT GGG CGT CCC AAA 3′. glutathione S-transferase 6-histidine phosphate-buffered saline PBS + Tween 20 bovine serum albumin. Bacteria were grown in 3 liter batches in shaker flasks. Protein expression was induced by addition of isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside. Expressed proteins were purified by one-step affinity chromatography using His-Bind® metal chelation resin (Novagen) or glutathione-Sepharose (Pharmacia) columns on a fast protein liquid chromatography system (Pharmacia) essentially following the manufacturer instructions. The purity of proteins expressed by these methods was assesed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (see Fig. 1). Protein concentrations were determined routinely using a bicinchoninic acid method (Pierce) with a bovine serum albumin (BSA) standard. Peptides were synthesized by standard solid phase methodology. Molecular weight was confirmed by mass spectrometry. Purity was considered acceptable when greater than 70% by high pressure liquid chromatography analysis. Peptides not meeting this criterion were high pressure liquid chromatography purified. The following peptides were synthesized: human Bax 21-mer (52-72) QDASTKKLSECLKRIGDELDS (TO4); peptides of 20, 19, 18, 17, 16, 15, and 14 amino acids in length corresponding to amino acids 53-72, 54-72, 55-72, 56-72, 57-72, 58-72, and 59-72 of the human Bax sequence; human Bak 16-mer (72-87) biotinylated on the N terminus GQVGRQLAIIGDDINR (TO16); human Bax (G67R) 21-mer (52-72) QDASTKKLSECLKRIRDELDS (TO9); mouse Bad 16-mer (138-153) biotinylated on the N terminus PPNLWAAQRYGRELRR (TO18). Purified 6H-Bax, 6H-Bcl-2 or 6H-Bcl-xL was diluted to 4 μg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and coated onto 96-well microtiter plates (50 μl/well; Immunosorb, Nunc) for 18 h at 4°C. All other incubations were performed at room temperature. The plates were washed 2 times with PBS containing 0.05% (v/v) Tween-20 (PBS-T) and then blocked with 150 μl of 2% (w/v) BSA in PBS for 2 h. Subsequently, the plates were washed 2 times with PBS-T and incubated with a range of concentrations (20-0.0001 μM) of GST-Bcl-2 or GST- Bcl-xL in PBS-T containing 0.5% (w/v) BSA (50 μl/well), and the interaction was allowed to proceed for 2 h before washing the plates 5 times with PBS-T. The wells were incubated for 1 h with 50 μl of the primary antibody, a mouse anti-GST monoclonal antibody (7E5A6) (a kind gift of John Reed) used at 1 ng/ml in PBS-T plus BSA, before being washed 5 times with PBS-T. An alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (ImmunoResearch Laboratories) was added (50 μl/well) and incubated for 1 h, and the plates were then washed 5 times. p-Nitrophenyl phosphate (Kirkegaard and Perry) at 4 mg/ml in 10 mM diethanolamine (pH 9.5) containing 0.5 mM MgCl2 was used as the enzyme substrate; the reaction was allowed to progress for 15 min and then stopped by the addition of 0.4 M NaOH (50 μl/well). The optical density at 405 nm was determined in a spectrophotometer (Molecular Devices). For the protein inhibition studies, the binding assay was carried out as above except for the following modifications. After the 96-well plates were coated with the appropriate proteins, the wells were then pre-incubated with increasing concentrations of 6H-Bcl-2, 6H-Bax, or 6H-Fadd (0.007-3.5 μM) before addition of the GST-tagged protein at a constant concentration (80 nM) throughout. This concentration was determined in preliminary experiments to be on the rate-limiting part of the binding curves. Similarly, peptide inhibition studies were carried out, as above, using increasing concentrations of the appropriate peptide (0.156-80 μM) for the pre-incubation. Quantitative solid-phase binding assays were created to measure the formation of Bcl-2/Bax and Bcl-xL/Bax heterodimers and Bcl-2/Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL/Bcl-xL homodimers. The requisite proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli as 6-histidine- or GST-fusion proteins and purified by affinity chromatography using Ni2+ chelation resin or glutathione-Sepharose, respectively. When analyzed by SDS-gel electrophoresis, these protein preparations yielded essentially single Coomassie Blue-stained bands (Fig. 1). For each specific interaction, saturable binding was observed, whereas only low levels of background binding were seen when the control protein BSA was used as the solid phase binding partner (Fig. 2 A and B). To confirm that these in vitro interactions reflect the interactions observed in cells, we assessed the ability of the G145A and G138A point mutants of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, respectively, to bind to Bax; it has previously been shown by immunoprecipitation that these mutants fail to heterodimerize with Bax in cells. Recapitulating the cellular result, the mutants demonstrated a much reduced binding to Bax in the plate-binding assay (Fig. 2A). Further control experiments demonstrate that the observed binding properties are not dependent upon the nature of N-terminal tags (data not shown). Interestingly, while Bcl-xL forms homodimers in the plate-binding assay (Fig. 2B), Bcl-xL homodimers form weakly if at all by yeast two-hybrid analysis (21Sato T. Hanada M. Bodrug S. Irie S. Iwama N.

The concentration of liquid-phase protein necessary for half-maximal binding for each reaction is presented in Table I.Table IEC50 values for heterodimer and homodimer formationSolid phaseLiquid phaseEC50NnM6H-BaxGST-Bcl-226.1 ± 10.4196H-BaxGST-Bcl-xL14.7 ± 5.3176H-Bcl-2GST-Bcl-266.2 ± 36.096H-Bcl-xLGST-Bcl-xL109.7 ± 26.011 Open table in a new tab If heterodimers and homodimers are formed by different sets of binding sites, then one would expect that Bax would only block heterodimer formation but would have no effect on formation of the homodimer. Alternatively, if both hetero- and homodimerization reflect binding at a common site on Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL, then Bax would be expected to block both interactions. To test this, we assessed the ability of 6H-Bcl-2, or 6H-Bax, to inhibit interactions in the plate binding assays. As expected, both Bcl-2 and Bax demonstrated dose-dependent inhibition of Bcl-2/Bax heterodimer formation (Fig. 3A) while control proteins (6H-mouse Fadd and casein) were inert. Similar results were obtained with the Bcl-xL/Bax heterodimer (Fig. 3B), demonstrating that Bcl-2 can cross-inhibit the related heterodimer interaction. Strikingly, Bax and Bcl-2 each inhibited the formation of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL homodimers (Fig. 3 C and D). These results indicate that Bax contains the structural motif necessary for inhibition of homodimerization and further demonstrates the cross-competition between Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL. Quantitatively, the inhibition of heterodimer and homodimer formation by Bcl-2 and Bax showed similar concentration dependences (Table II).Table II.IC50 values (μM) for inhibition of dimerization reactions by Bcl-2, Bax, and BH3-derived and control peptidesInhibitorBax/Bcl-2Bcl-2/Bcl-2Bax/Bcl-xLBcl-xL/Bcl-xL6H-Bcl-20.32 ± 0.060.99 ± 0.070.26 ± 0.020.46 ± 0.026H-Bax0.49 ± 0.060.68 ± 0.250.71 ± 0.021.3 ± 0.3Bax (amino acids 52-72)18.7 ± 1.129.6 ± 0.65.2 ± 0.54.4 ± 0.6Bak (amino acids 72-87)9.4 ± 0.66.4 ± 1.70.08 ± 0.020.08 ± 0.00a, value ± range for two determinations.Bax (amino acids 52-72) (G67R)>250>250>250>250Bad (amino acids 138-153)>250>250>250>250a , value ± range for two determinations. Open table in a new tab Mapping studies have indicated that Bax and Bak contain specific domains (BH3 domains) that are critical for their respective binding to Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL (18Chittenden T.

Chem. 1996; 271: 7440-7444Google Scholar). Based on the 7 helices observed within the crystal structure of Bcl-xL (24Muchmore S.W. Sattler M. Liang H. Meadows R.P. Harlan J.E. Yoon H.S. Nettesheim D. Chang B.S. Thompson C.B. Wong S.-L. Ng S.-C. Fesik S.W. Nature. 1996; 381: 335-341Google Scholar), these homologous BH3 regions are predicted to encompass the α2 helices within Bax and Bak (24Muchmore S.W. Sattler M. Liang H. Meadows R.P. Harlan J.E. Yoon H.S. Nettesheim D. Chang B.S. Thompson C.B. Wong S.-L. Ng S.-C. Fesik S.W. Nature. 1996; 381: 335-341Google Scholar). To determine if disruption of BH3 binding is sufficient to disrupt the formation of the full protein-protein heterodimers, BH3-derived peptides were used as competitors in the plate-binding assays. A 16-mer peptide derived from the BH3 domain of Bak (amino acids 72-87), and encompassing its predicted α2 helix, inhibited the formation of Bcl-2/Bax and Bcl-xL/Bax heterodimers, and similar inhibition was observed with a 21-mer peptide encompassing the homologous region in Bax (amino acids 52-72) (Fig. 4 A and B). In contrast, a control peptide derived from the sequence of mouse Bad and a BH3-derived peptide from Bax, but which contained a G67R substitution, failed to compete, demonstrating sequence specificity of the peptide inhibition. The Bax G67R substitution was observed as a naturally occurring mutation in the cell line HPB-ALL, derived from a patient with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (25Meijerink J.P.P. Smetsers T.F.C.M. Slöetjes A.W. Linders E.H.P. Mensink E.J.B.M. Leukemia. 1995; 9: 1828-1832Google Scholar). Having demonstrated that BH3-derived peptides were capable of preventing heterodimerization, we next examined their effect on homodimerization. The Bak- and Bax-derived peptides were capable of inhibiting Bcl-2/Bcl-2 as well as Bcl-xL/Bcl-xL homodimer formation while control peptides were not (Fig. 4 C and D). These results demonstrate that homodimers, like heterodimers, form through BH3-dependent interactions. Quantitatively, the Bcl-2 interactions (Bcl-2/Bcl-2 and Bax/Bcl-2) showed similar IC50 values for a given peptide inhibitor (Table II). The pair of Bcl-xL interactions (Bcl-xL/Bcl-xL and Bax/Bcl-xL) had IC50 values that were similar to each other for a given peptide but that differed from the IC50 values for the Bcl-2 interactions; the Bcl-xL interactions were more potently inhibited (Table II). The conclusion that similar BH3-dependent interactions underly both homo- and heterodimer formation was further supported by analyzing the effects of a set of 8 nested Bax-derived BH3 peptides (Bax, amino acids 52-72, through Bax, amino acids 59-72) on Bcl-xL/Bcl-xL and Bax/Bcl-xL interactions. While the peptides with a length of 15 amino acids or greater retained significant inhibitory activity in both assays, activity abruptly fell off against heterodimer and homodimer when the length fell to 14 amino acids (Fig. 5). Thus, the length dependence of peptide inhibition is identical for both types of interaction, in accord with the existence of a common binding site responsible for both hetero- and homodimerization. In the present study, we have investigated the binding properties of Bcl-2 family members with regard to homodimer and heterodimer formation. To perform these studies, we used recombinant Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Bax to construct reproducible solid-phase binding assays. We further validated the assays by demonstrating that BH1 mutants of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL lose their ability to bind to Bax in these assays as has previously been demonstrated in cells. Our data also provide the first estimate for the strength of these protein-protein interactions, although further efforts will be needed to obtain true Kd values. Interestingly, Bcl-xL readily formed homodimers in our assay, whereas attempts by others to observe this interaction in cells or with isolated protein have failed. While we do not understand the basis for these differences, it is possible that a specific conformation of Bcl-xL is favored when bound to plastic and that this conformation facilitates homodimerization. For example, this conformation may alter the positioning of the α2 helix, facilitating its interaction with a second molecule of Bcl-xL. The major objective of the present study was to determine if homodimers and heterodimers of Bcl-2 family members are formed by interactions at a common site or at different sites. Earlier data demonstrated that point mutants of Bcl-2 that lose their ability to heterodimerize with Bax can still form homodimerizers with wild-type Bcl-2, suggesting the possibility that distinct binding sites existed. Yeast two-hybrid analysis further suggested that homodimer and heterodimer formation utilized distinct binding domains, with the former occurring in an anti-parallel fashion and the latter in a parallel fashion (19Zha H. Aime-Sempe C. Sato T. Reed J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7440-7444Google Scholar, 20Yin X.-M. Oltvai Z.N. Korsmeyer S.J. Nature. 1994; 369: 321-333Google Scholar, 21Sato T. Hanada M. Bodrug S.

Sato T. Reed J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11962-11969Google Scholar). However, our new data argues strongly that a common binding site is responsible for both interactions. First, Bax inhibited not only heterodimer formation but also formation of homodimers. If unique binding sites were responsible for the two types of interaction, then Bax would not be expected to inhibit the homodimer. Second, peptides derived from the BH3 domains of Bax and Bak inhibit both homodimer and heterodimer formation, demonstrating that this domain is responsible for both interactions. And third, the inhibitory peptides showed the same length dependence against both interactions, further indicating that they inhibit heterodimers and homodimers by binding to a single binding site. The interactions involving Bcl-xL were more potently inhibited by each peptide than were the Bcl-2 containing interactions. However, for a given peptide, the IC50 for inhibiting Bcl-xL/Bcl-xL was very close to that for inhibition of Bax/Bcl-xL (Table II). Similarly, for a given peptide, the IC50 values for inhibiting Bcl-2/Bcl-2 and Bax/Bcl-2 were comparable (Table II). These quantitative relationships are in accord with the hypothesis that the peptides interact with a single site on Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL that prevents the subsequent binding of a BH3 domain provided by either Bax or another molecule of itself. Thus, our data support a model in which Bax, Bcl-2, or Bcl-xL provides a ligand consisting of its predicted α2 helix and which is bound by a single site in Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL. We cannot rigorously rule out the possibility that Bax contains a binding site for the BH3 domain of Bcl-2 and that this interaction contributes significantly to heterodimer formation. However, several observations render this possibility unlikely. First, the quantitative relationships described above do not support the idea of a peptide binding site on Bax. If the inhibitory peptides bound to a site on Bax, we would expect that a given peptide would have similar IC50 values for inhibition of the two Bax heterodimers, but this was not observed. Second, if Bax contained a binding site for the BH3 domains of Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL, we would expect that BH1 point mutations (G145A and G138A, respectively) would still bind avidly to Bax. However, it is possible that the residual weak interaction observed between Bax and Bcl-2 (G145A) (Fig. 2A) does in fact reflect such binding. Last, although it has been reported that mouse Bax can form homodimers (14Oltvai Z.N. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1993; 74: 609-619Google Scholar, 15Farrow S.N. White J.H.M. Martinou I.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7834-7838Google Scholar), published studies indicate that human Bax fails to homodimerize in a yeast two-hybrid assay (27Zhang H. Saeed B. Ng S.-C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 208: 950-956Google Scholar). This further supports the idea that the human Bax used in our studies has poor affinity as a receptor for BH3 domains of Bcl-2 family proteins. It is possible that Bax adopts a conformation distinct from the three-dimensional structure observed for Bcl-xL (24Muchmore S.W. Sattler M. Liang H. Meadows R.P. Harlan J.E. Yoon H.S. Nettesheim D. Chang B.S. Thompson C.B. Wong S.-L. Ng S.-C. Fesik S.W. Nature. 1996; 381: 335-341Google Scholar) and which favors the ability of it to act as a BH3 donor. While our data indicate that Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL both have sites that bind BH3 domains, the quantitative inhibitory data further indicate that these binding sites are pharmacologically distinct. The BH3-derived peptides, especially the Bak-derived peptide TO16, were significantly more potent in blocking the Bcl-xL interactions compared with the Bcl-2 interactions. This observation suggests that the binding sites in Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL may differ in functionally important ways. These data are also in accord with yeast two-hybrid binding data that demonstrate strong binding of Bak to Bcl-xL but not to Bcl-2 (15Farrow S.N. White J.H.M. Martinou I. Raven T. Pun K.-T. Grinham C.J. Martinou J.-C. Brown R. Nature. 1995; 374: 731-733Google Scholar). Given our data demonstrating a common site on Bcl-2 that is responsible for both homodimerization and heterodimerization, there are two possible explanations for the observation that Bcl-2 (G145A) retains an ability to dimerize with wild-type Bcl-2 but fails to bind Bax (20Yin X.-M. Oltvai Z.N. Korsmeyer S.J. Nature. 1994; 369: 321-333Google Scholar). It is possible that the G145A mutation in the BH1 domain destroys the binding site but that the BH3 domain in this mutant simply binds to the intact binding site in the wild-type Bcl-2 molecule. However, it is also possible that the G145A mutation modifies the binding site, preventing the BH3 domain of Bax from binding but still allowing the binding of the BH3 domain of Bcl-2. Experiments are in progress to distinguish between these models. The recently published three-dimensional structure of Bcl-xL demonstrates the presence of a hydrophobic cleft on the surface of the molecule, and it was suggested that this groove may represent the binding site for Bax and Bak (24Muchmore S.W. Sattler M. Liang H. Meadows R.P. Harlan J.E. Yoon H.S. Nettesheim D. Chang B.S. Thompson C.B. Wong S.-L. Ng S.-C. Fesik S.W. Nature. 1996; 381: 335-341Google Scholar). If so, our data further suggest that this groove also represents the binding site responsible for the observed Bcl-xL homodimerization.

Down-regulation of protein kinase C also blocked about 50% of PDGF-stimulated chemotaxis but did not block [Ca2+]o-stimulated chemotaxis. Thus, unlike PDGF-mediated chemotaxis, chemotaxis stimulated by [Ca2+]o does not appear to require protein kinase C activation. This finding suggests events downstream of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate production rather than diacylglycerol production are critical to [Ca2+]o-promoted chemotaxis of MC3T3-E1 cells. The signal transduction mechanism underlying PDGF-induced chemotaxis involves the activation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase, as judged by the in vivo production of phosphatidylinositol 3,4-diphosphate and 3,4,5-trisphosphate and the partial sensitivity of chemotaxis to wortmannin, an inhibitor of phosphoinositide 3-kinase.

News Physiol. Sci. 1994; 10: 1-5Google Scholar). Cellular responses to alterations in external calcium are diverse and cell-specific. Elevations in extracellular calcium signal parathyroid cells to reduce parathyroid hormone secretion (2Brown E.M. Physiol. Rev. 1991; 71: 371-411Google Scholar). Renin production by kidney cells is inhibited by high [Ca2+]o (3Fray J.C.S. Park C.S. Valentine N.D. Endocrinol. Rev. 1987; 8: 53-93Google Scholar). During bone remodeling, osteoclasts (bone-resorbing cells) and osteoblasts (bone-forming cells) function in local environments characterized by dramatic fluctuations in [Ca2+]o concentrations (4Silver I.A. Murrills R.J. Etherington D.J. Exp. Cell Res. 1988; 175: 266-276Google Scholar). Elevated external calcium in the resorption lucunae acts as a negative feedback on osteoclasts, inhibiting their resorptive capacity (5Zaidi M. Datta H.K. Patchell A. Moonga B. MacIntyre I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 163: 1461-1465Google Scholar). In contrast, high [Ca2+]o concentrations enhances DNA synthesis and promotes chemotaxis of osteoblasts (6Sugimoto T. Kanatani M. Kano J. Kaji H. Tsukamoto T. Yamaguchi T. Fukase M. Chihara K. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1993; 8: 1445-1452Google Scholar,7Quarles L.D. Hartle II, J.E. Middleton J.Z. Arthur J.M. Raymond J.R. J. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 56: 106-117Google Scholar). The signal transduction mechanisms underlying [Ca2+]o-stimulated mitogenesis and chemotaxis have yet to be defined; however, [Ca2+]o is capable of producing a transient elevation of intracellular calcium in osteoblasts at concentrations that initiate these two physiological processes (8Leis H.J. Zach D. Huber E. Ziermann L. Gleispach H. Windischhofer W. Cell Calcium. 1994; 15: 447-456Google Scholar). Since the transient rise in intracellular calcium was not a result of a [Ca2+]o influx, the existence of a cation-sensing receptor on the surface of osteoblasts was suggested, similar to that reported earlier in parathyroid cells (9Nemeth E.F. Wallace J. Scarpa A. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 2668-2674Google Scholar). Recently, calcium receptor cDNA has been cloned and transcripts of this gene were recovered from bovine and human parathyroid, kidney, thyroid and brain cells (10Brown E.M. Gamba G. Riccardi D. Lombardi M. Butters R. Kifor O. Sun A. Hediger M.A. Lytton J. Hebert S.C. Nature. 1993; 366: 575-580Google Scholar). This 120-kDa polyvalent receptor, BoPCaR1, consists of a seven-transmembrane region and belongs to the G-protein-linked receptor superfamily (10Brown E.M. Gamba G. Riccardi D. Lombardi M. Butters R. Kifor O. Sun A. Hediger M.A. Lytton J. Hebert S.C. Nature. 1993; 366: 575-580Google Scholar). Recent reports indicate that MC3T3-E1 osteoblast-like cells may have a [Ca2+]o-sensing receptor that is homologous, yet different, to the BoPCaR1 (11Quarles L.D. Hinson T.K. Seldin M.F. Siddhanti S.R. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1996; 11: S141Google Scholar). The aim of this report is to define the initial post-receptor signal transduction events in [Ca2+]o-stimulated chemotaxis of the murine osteoblast clonal cell line MC3T3-E1.

In previous studies of other cells, the signaling mechanisms underlying PDGF-induced chemotaxis were examined by mutating specific PDGF receptor tyrosine residues, and it was observed that PDGF-stimulated chemotaxis relies on both phospholipase C and the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (12Kundra V. Escobedo J.A. Kazlauskas A. Kim H.K. Rhee S.G. Williams L.T. Zetter B.R. Nature. 1994; 367: 474-476Google Scholar). Hepatocyte growth factor also activates both PI 3-kinase and PLC, and both signaling events are necessary for hepatocyte growth factor-promoted chemotaxis (13Derman M.P. Chen J.Y. Spokes K.C. Songyang Z. Cantley L.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4251-4255Google Scholar,14Derman M.P. Cunha M.J. Barros E.J.G. Nigam S.K. Cantley L.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: F1211-F1217Google Scholar). However, not all chemoattractants use this dual pathway paradigm. For example, basic fibroblast growth factor mediates chemotaxis without activating PLC (15Clyman R.I. Peters K.G. Chen Y.Q. Escobedo J. Williams L.T. Ives H.E. Wilson E. Cell Adhes. Commun. 1994; 1: 333-342Google Scholar). Therefore, the signal transduction mechanism utilized among chemoattractants is not universal. platelet-derived growth factor phospholipase C protein kinase C phosphatidylinositol 3,4-diphosphate phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate phosphoinositide 3-kinase α-modified Eagle's medium high pressure liquid chromatography phosphatidylinositol 4,5-diphosphate inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate diacylglycerol phorbol 12-myristate 13acetate anti-phosphotyrosine. We report that PDGF-mediated chemotaxis of MC3T3-E1 osteoblast-like cells is dependent on both PLC and PI 3-kinase. In contrast, extracellular calcium-stimulated chemotaxis requires PLC activation but not PI 3-kinase activation. Our results suggest that a G-protein-linked [Ca2+]o-sensing receptor is present on osteoblasts. The presence of such a receptor would allow extracellular calcium to act as a coupling agent, linking the bone resorptive phase of bone remodeling to bone formation. All chemicals were reagent grade or better. α-modified Eagle's medium (α-MEM), fetal calf serum, penicillin/streptomycin, and wortmannin were purchased from Sigma. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, amphotericin B (Fungizone), and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. Human PDGF-BB was acquired from Upstate Biochemicals Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). U-73122 and U-73433 were purchased from Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA).

[32P]ATP (specific activity, 3,000 Ci/mmol) and ortho-[32P]phosphate (specific activity, 8500-9120 Ci/mmol) was obtained from DuPont NEN. The anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (anti-Tyr(P)), a murine monoclonal antibody, was generously contributed by Dr. Thomas Roberts (Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA). MC3T3-E1 cells (16Kodama H. Amagai Y. Sudo H. Kasai S. Yamamoto S. Jpn. J. Oral Biol. 1981; 23: 899-901Google Scholar), a clonal line of normal murine osteoblasts, were kindly provided by Peter Hauscka (The Children's Hospital, Boston, MA). The cells were grown in a 95% air, 5% CO2 atmosphere in 100-mm diameter dishes containing α-MEM plus 10% fetal calf serum, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 0.025 μg/ml amphotericin B at 37°C. All experiments were conducted with cells at or near confluency. Where noted, serum-starvation of the MC3T3-E1 cells was accomplished through exposure to low serum medium (α-MEM plus 0.1% fetal calf serum) 12 h prior to stimulation. Protein kinase C down-regulated cells were generated by 12-h incubation of cells in low serum α-MEM containing 1 μM PMA. G-protein inhibition was accomplished by 12-h exposure of cells to low serum α-MEM containing 100 ng/ml pertussis toxin. Strict cell culture parameters were maintained, and cells were used early in their passage to avoid phenotypic maturation that might accompany long term cell culture. For example, we observed that U-73122 had an enhanced inhibitory effect on chemotaxis of late passage osteoblasts (data not shown). α-MEM has a basal calcium concentration of 1.8 mM. In all experiments, alterations in the extracellular calcium concentration from basal (1.8 mM) levels were produced by the addition of CaCl2 (Sigma) to the final concentration specified. A 48-well modified Boyden chemotaxis chamber (NeuroProbe Inc., Baltimore, MD) and polyvinylpyrrolidone-free polycarbonate filters (8-μm pore size) (Poretics Corp., Livermore, CA) were utilized as described previously (17Hughes F.J. Aubin J.E. Heersche J.N.M. Bone Miner. 1992; 19: 63-74Google Scholar) with the following alterations. The filters were coated with 50 μg/ml rat type I collagen (Collaborative Biomedical Products, Bedford, MA). Chemotactic agent ± inhibitor were diluted in low serum α-MEM, which was then added to the lower wells of the chamber. When dimethyl sulfoxide was used as a vehicle for an inhibitor, the final concentration of dimethyl sulfoxide was less than 0.01%. A coated filter was fixed atop the bottom wells. Cells were diluted in low serum α-MEM to a final concentration of 4 × 105 cells/ml. Inhibitors were added to the cell suspension where noted, and 50 μl of this suspension were loaded into each of the upper wells. In each experiment, at least 6 of the chamber's 48 wells were used for each condition examined. The chamber was incubated for 4 h at 37°C in a 95% air, 5% CO2 atmosphere. Following incubation, the chamber was disassembled, and the cells on the upper surface of the filter were removed. The cells on the lower surface were fixed and stained with Diff-Quik (Baxter Healthcare Corp., Miami, FL). Chemotaxis was quantified by counting the number of cells on the lower surface of the filter in each well using 100 nonoverlapping fields (× 200 magnification). For the purpose of comparison between multiple assays, the data were normalized by expressing it as the fold increase in cell chemotaxis relative to that of the control. Growth factors and inhibitors were exposed to serum-starved cells for the indicated time at 37°C. The cells were washed twice with 4 ml of cold phosphate buffered saline (137 mM NaCl, 15.7 mM NaH2PO4, 1.47 mM KH2PO4, 2.68 mM KCl (pH 7.4)) and were lysed in 1 ml lysis buffer (137 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris, 1 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM vanadate, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 4.5 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 mM ZnCl2, 48 mM NaF, 9 mMβ-glycerophosphate). The lysates were vortexed and centrifuged at 16,000 × g (Eppendorf 5414 microcentrifuge). The cleared supernatants were transferred to new Eppendorf tubes and incubated with anti-phosphotyrosine (6.6 μg/ml) for 1 h at 4°C, followed by the addition of protein A-Sepharose (4 mg/ml lysate) for an additional 2 h at 4°C. The immunoprecipitates were pelleted, washed three times in phosphate-buffered saline, 1% Nonidet P-40, twice in 0.1 M Tris (pH 7.5), 0.5 M LiCl, and twice in TNE (10 mM Tris, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA (pH 7.5)). All three wash solutions contained 200 μM vanadate. To assay the phosphoinositide 3-kinase activity of the immunoprecipitates, sonicated phosphatidylinositol (PI) (0.2 mg/ml final concentration, in 10 mM HEPES, 1 mM EGTA (pH 7.5)) and [γ-32P]ATP (10-20 μCi/sample) were added to the immunoprecipitates for 10 min at room temperature. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 80 μl of HCl and 160 μl of methanol:chloroform (1:1 (v/v) mixture). The lipid-containing organic phase was separated on oxalate-coated thin-layer chromatography (Silica Gel 60; MCB Reagents, Merck) and developed in chloroform:methanol:water:ammonium hydroxide (60:47:11.3:2, v/v). Radiolabeled spots corresponding to phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate were quantified using a phosphoimager (Bio-Rad). MC3T3-E1 cells were serum-starved for 24 h in α-MEM containing 0.1% (v/v) fetal calf serum. The cells were incubated in 5 ml of phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 45 min, followed by exposure to 2 ml of the same medium plus carrier-free ortho-[32P]phosphate (0.5-2 mCi/ml). The cells were allowed to incorporate the radioisotope at 37°C for 3 h in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. PDGF (10 ng/ml) or calcium (5 mM final concentration) was subsequently added to the dishes for 1-5 min. Cells were washed twice with 20 mM Tris (pH 7.5), followed by addition of 750 μl of 1 M HCl:methanol (1:1, v/v). The cells were scraped with a cell scraper, and the mixture was vortexed in a 2-ml microcentrifuge tube. Chloroform (380 μl) was added to the lysates and vortexed vigorously. The samples were centrifuged briefly at 16,000 × g. The lower chloroform phase was extracted twice with 400 μl of methanol:EDTA (0.1 M, pH 7.5) in a 1:0.9 (v/v) mixture. The organic (lower) was transferred to glass scintillation vials and dried under N2. Deacylation of the lipids was performed using methylamine reagent as described previously (18Soltoff S.P. Kaplan D.R. Cantley L.C. Methods Neurosci. 1993; 18: 100-112Google Scholar). The glycerophosphoinositides were resuspended in 120 μl of distilled water and filtered using a 0.2-μm filter. The glycerophosphoinositides were then separated by HPLC using a 12.5-cm Partisphere 5-μm strong anion exchange column (SAX, Whatman) and a salt gradient from 0 to 1.0 M (NH4)2HPO4 (pH 3.8), as described previously (18Soltoff S.P. Kaplan D.R. Cantley L.C. Methods Neurosci. 1993; 18: 100-112Google Scholar). The HPLC system was connected to an on-line continuous flow liquid scintillation detector (Flow-One/Beta CT; Beckman Instruments). Data given as the means ± the S.E. of the means, with the number of determinations (n) representing separate experiments. There was a dose-dependent relationship between the extracellular calcium concentration and the rate of chemotaxis of the MC3T3-E1 osteoblast-like cells. The maximum chemotactic effect was attained at a calcium concentration of 5 mM (Fig. 1). A substantial enhancement of chemotaxis was also seen at 3 mM calcium, a concentration less than twice the basal concentration (1.8 mM). At 10 mM calcium, the rate of chemotaxis was greater than the basal rate, but was less than the peak rate. Chemotaxis of the MC3T3-E1 cells was not increased when sodium chloride was used to produce osmolar increases equivalent to the CaCl2 additions, suggesting that slight increases in medium osmolality were not responsible for the initiation of chemotaxis by increases in [Ca2+]o (data not shown). Using the Zigmond-Hirsch (19Zigmond S.H. Hirsch J.G. J. Exp. Med. 1973; 137: 387-410Google Scholar) checkerboard analysis, the [Ca2+]o-induced cell movement was found to be directed chemotaxis rather than random chemokinesis (data not shown). PDGF-BB also promoted an increase in chemotaxis of the MC3T3-E1 osteoblasts. In 12 experiments in which the effects of PDGF and [Ca2+]o were compared directly, PDGF (10 ng/ml) increased chemotaxis to 20.3 ± 1.2 times basal (no stimulus) levels, and [Ca2+]o (5 mM) increased chemotaxis to 7.9 ± 0.4 times basal levels. Previous studies in this cell line have described a dose-dependent relationship between PDGF concentration and chemotaxis, and PDGF-promoted chemotaxis has been observed in other cell lines (20Tsukamoto T. Matsui T. Fukase M. Fujita T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 175: 745-751Google Scholar, 21Seppä H. Grotendorst G. Seppä S. Schiffmann E. Martin G.R. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 92: 584-588Google Scholar, 22Siegbahn A. Hammacher A. Westermark B. Heldin C. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 85: 916-920Google Scholar). In contrast, the chemotactic effect of extracellular calcium appears to be cell type specific. [Ca2+]o-induced increases in chemotaxis were not seen using NIH-3T3 fibroblasts exposed to 5 or 10 mM calcium, although PDGF (10 ng/ml) stimulated chemotaxis of these cells to 9 times the basal level (data not shown). Previous studies have reported that several cell types have a G-protein-coupled calcium receptor (1Nemeth E.F. News Physiol. Sci. 1994; 10: 1-5Google Scholar). Since the stimulatory effect of extracellular calcium on chemotaxis suggests that MC3T3-E1 cells have calcium receptors, we investigated whether the chemotaxis response in MC3T3-E1 cells was sensitive to pertussis toxin. Pertussis toxin prevents receptor activation of some G-proteins by catalyzing ADP-ribosylation of the G-protein α-subunits (23Locht C. Antoine R. Biochimie. 1995; 77: 333-340Google Scholar). Following 12-h exposure to 100 ng/ml pertussis toxin, [Ca2+]o-directed chemotaxis of the MC3T3-E1 cells was almost completely inhibited (Table I). In contrast, pertussis toxin had hardly any effect on PDGF-induced chemotaxis of these cells (Table I). These data suggest that a G-protein-linked calcium receptor plays a critical role in [Ca2+]o-stimulated chemotaxis, whereas a pertussis toxin-sensitive G-protein activation is not involved in PDGF-directed chemotaxis.Table I.The role of various signaling molecules in PDGF- and [Ca2+]o-stimulated chemotaxis of MC3T3-E1 cellsChemoattractantInhibition of chemotaxisPertussis toxinU-73122PKC down-regulationWortmannin%PDGF (10 ng/ml)11 ± 1ap < 0.001 versus no inhibitory effect.48 ± 7ap < 0.001 versus no inhibitory effect.54 ± 5ap < 0.001 versus no inhibitory effect.60 ± 7ap < 0.001 versus no inhibitory effect.[Ca2+]o (5 mM)90 ± 5ap < 0.001 versus no inhibitory effect.88 ± 4ap < 0.001 versus no inhibitory effect.5 ± 413 ± 10(n = 3)(n = 4)(n = 4)(n = 3)a p < 0.001 versus no inhibitory effect. Open table in a new tab U-73122 inhibits the activation of phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC) (24Bleasdale J.E. Thakur N.R. Gremban R.S. Bundy G.L. Fitzpatrick F.A. Smith R.J. Bunting S. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1990; 255: 756-768Google Scholar). Although the precise mechanism of inhibition has yet to be defined, U-73122 probably disrupts the link between G-proteins and PLC (25Yule D.I. Williams J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13830-13835Google Scholar). [Ca2+]o-directed chemotaxis was almost completely inhibited by this compound, whereas PDGF-stimulated chemotaxis was reduced by only about 50% (Table I). U-73433, an inactive analog of U-73122, had no effect on either [Ca2+]o or PDGF-stimulated chemotaxis (data not shown). Previous studies have shown that PLC activation is involved in PDGF-directed chemotaxis (12Kundra V. Escobedo J.A. Kazlauskas A. Kim H.K. Rhee S.G. Williams L.T. Zetter B.R. Nature. 1994; 367: 474-476Google Scholar). Our results indicate that PLC activation may be responsible for about half of the PDGF-directed chemotaxis response in MC3T3-E1 cells. However, the role of PI-PLC is even more critical in [Ca2+]o-directed chemotaxis of MC3T3-E1 cells, and accounts for nearly the entire response. Consistent with the data obtained using pertussis toxin, these findings suggest the chemotactic effect of [Ca2+]o is mediated by a calcium receptor linked to PLC. Activation of PLC leads to hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-P2, generating inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG) (26Nishizuka Y. Science. 1986; 233: 305-312Google Scholar). IP3 enhances calcium release from intracellular stores, and DAG recruits and activates protein kinase C (PKC), a serine/threonine kinase (26Nishizuka Y. Science. 1986; 233: 305-312Google Scholar). After PKC was down-regulated by a 12-h exposure of the cells to 1 μM PMA, about half of the PDGF-stimulated chemotaxis was blocked (Table I). In contrast, [Ca2+]o-directed chemotaxis of the MC3T3-E1 cells was not reduced by PKC down-regulation (Table I). Thus, while the U-73122 studies indicate that both [Ca2+]o- and PDGF-stimulated chemotaxis utilize PLC activation, only PDGF-directed chemotaxis involved PKC. When added to low serum media in the bottom wells of the modified Boyden chamber, PMA (100 nM) did not stimulate chemotaxis of MC3T3-E1 relative to basal (0.8 times relative to basal, n = 2). Therefore, phorbol ester-mediated PKC activation alone is not sufficient to induce chemotaxis in this cell line, even though PKC plays an important role in PDGF-stimulated chemotaxis. In other cell lines, phorbol ester does function as a chemoattractant capable of producing a robust chemotactic effect (27Laskin D.L. Laskin J.D. Weinstein B. Carchman R.A. Cancer Res. 1981; 41: 1923-1928Google Scholar,28Rosen E.M. Goldberg I.D. Liu D. Setter E. Donovan M.A. Bhargava M. Reiss M. Kacinski B.M. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 5315-5321Google Scholar). The absence of PMA-directed chemotaxis in MC3T3-E1 cells may be indicative of the unique nature of the signal transduction mechanism that drives chemotaxis of these osteoblast-like cells. Wortmannin, a fungal metabolite, acts as a specific irreversible inhibitor of the catalytic p110 subunit of PI 3-kinase (29Powis G. Bonjouklian R. Berggren M.M. Gallegos A. Abraham R. Ashendel C. Zalkow L. Matter W.F. Dodge J. Grindey G. Vlahow C.J. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 2419-2423Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that wortmannin will inhibit both PDGF- and hepatocyte growth factor-stimulated chemotaxis, linking PI 3-kinase activation to chemotaxis (13Derman M.P. Chen J.Y. Spokes K.C. Songyang Z. Cantley L.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4251-4255Google Scholar,14Derman M.P. Cunha M.J. Barros E.J.G. Nigam S.K. Cantley L.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: F1211-F1217Google Scholar,30Thelen M. Uguccioni M. Bosiger J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 217: 1255-1262Google Scholar). Consistent with these findings, PDGF-stimulated chemotaxis of MC3T3-E1 cells was inhibited by at least 50% when 100 nM wortmannin was present in both the upper and lower chambers of the Boyden apparatus (Table I). In contrast, wortmannin did not significantly alter the chemotactic effect of extracellular calcium in MC3T3-E1 cells (Table I). These results suggest that the promotion of chemotaxis by extracellular calcium differs from that promoted by PDGF, since PI 3-kinase does not appear to be involved in the signal transduction pathway for [Ca2+]o-stimulated chemotaxis of MC3T3-E1 cells. In anti-phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitates from MC3T3-E1 cells exposed to 10 ng/ml PDGF, there was an elevation of PI 3-kinase activity to 12.1 ± 2.2 (n = 8) times that found under basal conditions (Fig. 2). In contrast, there was no increase (1.1 ± 0.1, n = 3) in PI 3-kinase activity above basal levels in anti-phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitates from calcium (5 mM)-treated cells. This suggests that elevation in external calcium does not affect PI 3-kinase activity. To examine the in vivo production of phosphoinositides phosphorylated on the D-3 position of the inositol ring, the lipid products of PI 3-kinase, the osteoblasts were loaded with inorganic ortho-[32P]phosphate and then exposed to PDGF (10 ng/ml) or increases in extracellular calcium (5 mM final concentration). PDGF produced substantial increases in D-3 lipids. There was a 3-fold elevation in PI-3,4-P2 and a 13-fold increase in PI-3,4,5-P3 levels after a 1-min exposure to PDGF (Fig. 3). A 5-min exposure to PDGF produced a 5- and 13.5-fold elevation in PI-3,4-P2 and PI-3,4,5,-P3, respectively. In contrast, extracellular calcium (1 or 5 min) did not enhance production of either PI-3,4-P2 or PI-3,4,5,-P3 in MC3T3-E1 cells (Fig. 3). These results are consistent with the in vitro immunoprecipitation data in that extracellular calcium did not activate PI 3-kinase in MC3T3-E1 cells, whereas PDGF-BB significantly increased PI 3-kinase activity.Fig. 3PDGF, but not extracellular calcium, stimulated the in vivo production of D-3 phosphorylated phosphoinositides in MC3T3-E1 cells. MC3T3-E1 cells were loaded with organic ortho-[32P]phosphate for 3 h, then exposed to either PDGF (10 ng/ml) or calcium (5 mM) for 1-5 min. The D-3 phosphorylated lipids were extracted and deacylated as described under “Materials and Methods.” HPLC analysis was performed to separate the lipids and quantify their production based on disintegrations/min. The PI-4-phosphate and PI-4,5-P2 levels were summed and used to represent total phospholipids. The PI-3,4-P2 and PI-3,4,5-P3 levels were then expressed as a percentage of total phospholipids. There were significant increases in PI-3,4-P2 and PI-3,4,5-P3 levels in cells exposed to PDGF for 1 and 5 min. In contrast, neither a 1- or 5-min exposure to 5 mM calcium produced a significant elevation in PI-3,4-P2 or PI-3,4,5-P3. Pretreatment of the organic ortho-[32P]phosphate-loaded cells with 100 nM wortmannin (20 min) resulted in a complete inhibition of the PDGF-stimulated (5 min) elevation in the PI-3,4-P2 level, and the PDGF-mediated increase in PI-3,4,5-P3 was reduced by 60% after wortmannin pretreatment. Wortmannin had no substantial effect on [Ca2+]o-stimulated PI 3-kinase activity. Values with error bars represent the mean ± S.E. of four experiments performed in duplicate determinations for each experiment. Values without error bars represent the average of duplicate determinations from one experiment. *p < 0.05 versus basal; **p < 0.01 versus basal.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Pretreatment of 32P-labeled cells with 100 nM wortmannin (20 min) produced a complete inhibition of 5-min PDGF-stimulated PI-3,4-P2 production and a 60% reduction in PDGF-induced PI-3,4,5-P3 production (Fig. 3). Wortmannin had a negligible effect on the D-3 lipids produced in cells exposed to 5 mM extracellular calcium, consistent with the lack of effect of calcium on PI 3-kinase activity in vivo (Fig. 3). These results support the wortmannin-sensitivity of the chemotaxis assay which indicated a requirement for PI 3-kinase activation in PDGF-stimulated, but not [Ca2+]o-directed, chemotaxis of MC3T3-E1 cells (Table I). The results of the present study suggest that different chemoattractants can stimulate chemotaxis of the same cell type through chemoattractant-specific signal transduction mechanisms. PDGF produced large increases in PI 3-kinase activity, and the activation of PI 3-kinase and PLC appeared to contribute equally to PDGF-promoted chemotaxis (Table I). In contrast, while elevation in extracellular calcium promoted the chemotaxis of MC3T3-E1 cells, this response appeared to be dependent on the activation of PLC. Extracellular calcium did not activate PI 3-kinase in MC3T3-E1 cells, and [Ca2+]o-stimulated chemotaxis was not sensitive to wortmannin, an inhibitor of PI 3-kinase activity. Our results strongly suggest that MC3T3-E1 cells have a pertussis toxin-sensitive G-protein-linked calcium receptor, and that activation of this receptor stimulates chemotaxis utilizing a PLC-dependent mechanism. Brown et al. (10Brown E.M. Gamba G. Riccardi D. Lombardi M. Butters R. Kifor O. Sun A. Hediger M.A. Lytton J. Hebert S.C. Nature. 1993; 366: 575-580Google Scholar) recently cloned a calcium-sensing receptor from bovine parathyroid cells. In addition to parathyroid cells, BoPCaR1 mRNA transcripts were found in kidney, brain, and thyroid cells (10Brown E.M. Gamba G. Riccardi D. Lombardi M. Butters R. Kifor O. Sun A. Hediger M.A. Lytton J. Hebert S.C. Nature. 1993; 366: 575-580Google Scholar). The BoPCaR1 belongs to the seven-transmembrane receptor family and is linked via a G-protein to PLC (10Brown E.M. Gamba G. Riccardi D. Lombardi M. Butters R. Kifor O. Sun A. Hediger M.A. Lytton J. Hebert S.C. Nature. 1993; 366: 575-580Google Scholar). Activation of this receptor by extracellular calcium leads to elevation in IP3 with subsequent increases in the intracellular calcium concentration (1Nemeth E.F. News Physiol. Sci. 1994; 10: 1-5Google Scholar). A recent report suggests that MC3T3-E1 osteoblast-like cells do not express the BoPCaR1, at least not in great abundance, but may produce a calcium-sensing receptor that is similar, yet distinct, to BoPCaR1 (11Quarles L.D. Hinson T.K. Seldin M.F. Siddhanti S.R. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1996; 11: S141Google Scholar). Evidence for receptor-mediated signaling by extracellular calcium in MC3T3-E1 cells was indicated by the results obtained using two inhibitors, pertussis toxin and U-73122. Pertussis toxin, an inhibitor of G-protein activation, blocked almost all of the [Ca2+]o-stimulated chemotaxis (Table I). This result suggests that a G-protein-linked receptor must be involved in [Ca2+]o-mediated chemotaxis. In some cells, including osteoblasts (31Lieberherr M. Grosse B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7217-7223Google Scholar), pertussis toxin has been shown to inhibit agonist-stimulated transient elevations in intracellular calcium. Pertussis toxin also effects the activation of adenylate cyclase through inhibition of Gi. The role that adenylate cyclase and cAMP play in [Ca2+]o-stimulated chemotaxis of MC3T3-E1 cells has yet to be examined. Several other chemoattractants activate G-protein-linked receptors. For example, neutrophil chemotaxis in response to leukotriene B4 and formyl-methionyl-lucyl-phenylalanine is inhibited by pertussis toxin (32Goldman D.W. Chang F.-H. Gifford L.A. Goetzl E.J. Bourne H.R. J. Exp. Med. 1985; 162: 145-156Google Scholar,33Molski T.F. Naccache P.H. Marsh M.L. Kermode J. Becker E.L. Sha'fai R.I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1984; 124: 644-650Google Scholar). The limited effect of pertussis toxin on PDGF-mediated chemotaxis (Table I) was expected, since PDGF acts through a tyrosine kinase receptor rather than a G-protein-linked receptor (34Wang C. Gerard N.P. Nicholson-Weller A. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 786-792Google Scholar). Signaling events downstream of both G-protein-linked receptors and receptor tyrosine kinases activation include the stimulation of PLC activity. In the presence of U-73122, which blocks the activation of PI-PLC, [Ca2+]o-directed chemotaxis was almost completed inhibited (Table I). This result indicates that [Ca2+]o-mediated chemotaxis of MC3T3-E1 cells requires PLC. U-73122 had a substantial, but less complete, inhibitory effect on PDGF-directed chemotaxis of these cells, confirming previous evidence suggesting that PLC is one of two signal transduction pathways that are critical for PDGF-directed chemotaxis (12Kundra V. Escobedo J.A. Kazlauskas A. Kim H.K. Rhee S.G. Williams L.T. Zetter B.R. Nature. 1994; 367: 474-476Google Scholar). The fact that PDGF promotes a substantial chemotaxis response in U-73122-treated cells suggests that the near complete inhibition of [Ca2+]o-directed chemotaxis by U-73122 was not due to a nonspecific toxic effect of this inhibitor on MC3T3-E1 cells. Activation of PLC leads to hydrolysis of PI-4,5-P2 to form DAG and IP3 (26Nishizuka Y. Science. 1986; 233: 305-312Google Scholar). DAG activates PKC, a serine/threonine kinase that is involved in multiple signaling events (26Nishizuka Y. Science. 1986; 233: 305-312Google Scholar). In studies in which cells were exposed to phorbol ester to down-regulate PKC, we found that PKC is critical to PDGF-stimulated chemotaxis of MC3T3-E1 cells (Table I). In contrast, [Ca2+]o-stimulated chemotaxis did not appear to require PKC activation, even though PLC activation was necessary. Alternatively, it is possible that a PKC isoform(s) which is relatively slowly down-regulated or is insensitive to PMA (e.g. PKC ζ) contributes to [Ca2+]o-promoted chemotaxis. When PMA (100 nM) was added to the bottom wells of the Boyden chamber, direct migration of MC3T3-E1 cells was not observed, suggesting that PMA alone is not a chemoattractant for these cells. Hemolytically inactive complement component complex C5b67 induces chemotaxis of neutrophils through a G-protein-linked receptor which activates PLC, but not PKC (34Wang C. Gerard N.P. Nicholson-Weller A. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 786-792Google Scholar). Our data suggests that the IP3 pathway rather than the DAG pathway is important in [Ca2+]o-initiated chemotaxis of MC3T3-E1 cells. Since extracellular calcium and PDGF both have been reported to elevate the intracellular calcium concentration, it is possible that a rise in intracellular calcium contributes to chemotaxis in MC3T3-E1 cells. Consistent with this, both PDGF- and extracellular calcium-stimulated chemotaxis were reduced in cells loaded with the calcium-chelator BAPTA (data not shown). However, this may have been due to an effect on regulatory components in cell migration/chemotaxis that are far downstream from receptor activation. PDGF increased PI 3-kinase activity and the production of PI-3,4-P2 and PI-3,4,5-P3 in MC3T3-E1 cells (Fig. 2, Fig. 3). Wortmannin, a PI 3-kinase inhibitor, significantly reduced both the in vivo and in vitro PDGF-mediated elevations of the D-3 phosphorylated lipids. Furthermore, PDGF-directed chemotaxis of the MC3T3-E1 cells was significantly inhibited by wortmannin (Table I). Thus, PDGF-stimulated chemotaxis requires PI 3-kinase activity in addition to PLC activation, as others have reported in other cells (12Kundra V. Escobedo J.A. Kazlauskas A. Kim H.K. Rhee S.G. Williams L.T. Zetter B.R. Nature. 1994; 367: 474-476Google Scholar). In contrast, cells exposed to increases in [Ca2+]o did not display an increase in PI 3-kinase activity in the in vitro assays of anti-phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitates (Fig. 2). To rule out activation of PI 3-kinase via a G-protein-linked receptor (35Stoyanov B. Volinia S. Hanck T. Rubio I. Loubtchenkov M. Malek D. Stoyanova S. Vanhaesebroeck B. Dhand R. Nürnberg B. Gierschik P. Seedorf K. Hsuan J.J. Waterfield M.D. Wetzker R. Science. 1995; 269: 690-693Google Scholar), which may not recruit PI 3-kinase to a tyrosine phosphorylated protein, we measured the D-3 lipid production in vivo. PI-3,4-P2 and PI-3,4,5-P3 levels were not elevated by an increase in extracellular calcium (Fig. 3). In addition, wortmannin had an insignificant effect on [Ca2+]o-stimulated chemotaxis of MC3T3-E1 cells (Table I). These data suggest that PI 3-kinase is not involved in extracellular calcium-stimulated chemotaxis. In neutrophils, similar findings demonstrated that PI 3-kinase was essential for PDGF-mediated chemotaxis but was not necessary for chemotaxis directed by chemoattractants that act through G-protein-linked receptors (30Thelen M. Uguccioni M. Bosiger J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 217: 1255-1262Google Scholar). Previous studies have described a dose-dependent relationship between extracellular calcium concentration and chemotaxis in MC3T3-E1 osteoblast-like cells (6Sugimoto T. Kanatani M. Kano J. Kaji H. Tsukamoto T. Yamaguchi T. Fukase M. Chihara K. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1993; 8: 1445-1452Google Scholar). Our results are consistent with these studies in that concentration-dependent increases in chemotaxis were observed between 1.8 and 5 mM calcium. In contrast to our results shown in Fig. 1 Sugimoto et al. (6Sugimoto T. Kanatani M. Kano J. Kaji H. Tsukamoto T. Yamaguchi T. Fukase M. Chihara K. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1993; 8: 1445-1452Google Scholar) reported that the chemotactic effect of [Ca2+]o was further enhanced at a 10 mM concentration. We found that the stimulation of chemotaxis of MC3T3-E1 cells at this calcium concentration was less than that found at 5 mM. Other investigators have described a reduction of chemotaxis in the presence of high concentrations of chemoattractant and have attributed this effect to a more rapid dissolution of the chemoattractant gradient responsible for directed cell movement (36Vaziri C. Faller D.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13642-13648Google Scholar). Increases in extracellular calcium may act as a physiological stimulus for bone cells. Bone remodeling consists of two components, a resorptive phase followed by a reparative phase (37Parfitt A.M. Clin. Obstet. Gynecol. 1987; 30: 789-811Google Scholar). Osteoclasts resorb bone by creating a local environment capable of demineralizing bone and proteolyzing bone matrix proteins (38Baron R. Neff L. Louvard D. Courtoy P.J. J. Cell. Biol. 1985; 101: 2210-2222Google Scholar). The initiation of the reparative phase, known as reversal, requires the recruitment and activation of osteoblasts (37Parfitt A.M. Clin. Obstet. Gynecol. 1987; 30: 789-811Google Scholar). Several cytokines and growth factors, including PDGF, have been implicated as coupling agents, capable of inducing reversal (39Hauschka P.V. Mavrakos A.E. Iafrati M.D. Doleman S.E. Klagsbrun M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 12665-12674Google Scholar,40Canalis E. McCarthy T. Centrella M. J. Clin. Invest. 1988; 81: 277-281Google Scholar). Osteoblasts incorporate the growth factors into the bone matrix during the reparative phase of bone remodeling (39Hauschka P.V. Mavrakos A.E. Iafrati M.D. Doleman S.E. Klagsbrun M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 12665-12674Google Scholar). These coupling agents are then released from the bone matrix throughout the resorptive phase (39Hauschka P.V. Mavrakos A.E. Iafrati M.D. Doleman S.E. Klagsbrun M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 12665-12674Google Scholar, 40Canalis E. McCarthy T. Centrella M. J. Clin. Invest. 1988; 81: 277-281Google Scholar, 41Oreffo R.O.C. Mundy G.R. Seyedin S.M. Bonewald L.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 158: 817-823Google Scholar). In addition to liberating growth factors, osteoclasts dramatically alter extracellular calcium concentration at local sites of resorption. The extracellular calcium concentration can reach 40 mM within the resorption lucunae (4Silver I.A. Murrills R.J. Etherington D.J. Exp. Cell Res. 1988; 175: 266-276Google Scholar). By inhibiting osteoclastic activity while stimulating chemotaxis and mitogenesis of osteoblasts, extracellular calcium may serve as a key coupling agent between bone formation and resorption (5Zaidi M. Datta H.K. Patchell A. Moonga B. MacIntyre I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 163: 1461-1465Google Scholar,6Sugimoto T. Kanatani M. Kano J. Kaji H. Tsukamoto T. Yamaguchi T. Fukase M. Chihara K.

https://openalex.org/W2094706459,"SATB1 is a cell type-specific nuclear matrix attachment region (MAR) DNA-binding protein, predominantly expressed in thymocytes. We identified an atypical homeodomain and two Cut-like repeats in SATB1, in addition to the known MAR-binding domain. The isolated MAR-binding domain recognizes a certain DNA sequence context within MARs that is highly potentiated for base unpairing. Unlike the MAR-binding domain, the homeodomain when isolated binds poorly and with low specificity to DNA. However, the combined action of the MAR-binding domain and the homeodomain allows SATB1 to specifically recognize the core unwinding element within the base-unpairing region. The core unwinding element is critical for MAR structure, since point mutations within this core abolish the unwinding propensity of the MAR. The contribution of the homeodomain is abolished by alanine substitutions of arginine 3 and arginine 5 in the N-terminal arm of the homeodomain. Site-directed mutagenesis of the core unwinding element in the 3′ MAR of the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene enhancer revealed the sequence 5′-(C/A)TAATA-3′ to be essential for the increase in affinity mediated by the homeodomain.

SATB1 may regulate T-cell development and function at the level of higher order chromatin structure through the critical DNA structural elements within MARs. Eukaryotic chromosomes are thought to be separated into topologically independent loop domains by periodic attachment onto an intranuclear frame known as the nuclear matrix or skeleton, defined as the insoluble material left in the nucleus after a series of biochemical extraction steps (1Nelson W.G. Pienta K.J. Barrack E.R. Coffey D.S. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1986; 15: 457-475Google Scholar). Specific DNA sequences that bind to the nuclear matrix in vitro are called matrix attachment regions (MARs), 1The abbreviations used are: MARmatrix attachment regionGSTglutathione S-transferasewtwild typemutmutantbpbase pair(s)PCRpolymerase chain reaction. and these sequences have been postulated to form the base of chromosomal loops (reviewed in Refs. 2Earnshaw W.C. BioEssays. 1988; 9: 147-150Google Scholar and 3Gasser S.M. Laemmli U.K. Trends Genet. 1987; 3: 16-22Google Scholar). MARs may be important to organize chromosomes and regulate DNA transcription and replication within the nucleus. In support of this notion, MARs often colocalize or are located in close proximity to regulatory sequences including enhancers (4Cockerill P.N. Yuen M.-H. Garrard W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 5394-5397Google Scholar, 5Klehr D. Maass K. Bode J. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1264-1270Google Scholar, 6Mielke C. Kohwi Y. Kohwi-Shigematsu T. Bode J.

Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1264-1270Google Scholar, 6Mielke C. Kohwi Y. Kohwi-Shigematsu T. Bode J. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 7475-7485Google Scholar, 7Poljak L. Seum C. Mattioni T.

Kay V. Schlake T. Landsmann J. Bode J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 2744-2751Google Scholar). Recent evidence shows that MARs play a role in tissue-specific gene expression. The MARs associated with the immunoglobulin μ heavy chain locus are essential for transcription of a rearranged μ gene in transgenic B lymphocytes (12Forrester W.C. van Genderen C. Jenuwein T. Grosschedl R. Science. 1994; 265: 1221-1225Google Scholar). Identification of the cell type-specific MAR-binding protein SATB1, which is predominantly expressed in thymocytes, shows that MARs can be specific targets for a cell type-specific factor (13Dickinson L.A. Joh T. Kohwi Y. Kohwi-Shigematsu T. Cell. 1992; 70: 631-645Google Scholar). matrix attachment region glutathione S-transferase wild type mutant base pair(s) polymerase chain reaction. SATB1 defines a novel class of DNA-binding proteins that recognize a specific sequence context that exhibits a high base unpairing or unwinding propensity. MARs are generally AT-rich and typically contain a subregion(s) that exhibits a strong potential to base-unpair under negative superhelical strain (10Bode J. Kohwi Y. Dickinson L. Joh T. Klehr D. Mielke C. Kohwi-Shigematsu T. Science. 1992; 255: 195-197Google Scholar, 14Kohwi-Shigematsu T. Kohwi Y. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 9551-9560Google Scholar). A high AT content, however, is not sufficient to confer high affinity binding to SATB1; specific mutations within MARs, which maintain the AT-richness but eradicate the unwinding capability, substantially reduce or abolish SATB1 binding (13Dickinson L.A. Joh T. Kohwi Y. Kohwi-Shigematsu T. Cell. 1992; 70: 631-645Google Scholar). Analysis of SATB1 binding sites in MARs revealed that binding is restricted to the subregion of MARs that has a high unwinding propensity. This base-unpairing region consists of a cluster of sequence stretches with a special AT-rich DNA sequence context, in which Cs are sequestered exclusively on one strand and Gs on the other (ATC sequences) (13Dickinson L.A. Joh T. Kohwi Y. Kohwi-Shigematsu T. Cell. 1992; 70: 631-645Google Scholar). A short core unwinding element can be present within one of these ATC sequences, which can be detected by virtue of its most persistent base unpairing even under conditions that favor the double-stranded DNA configuration; mutation of this element abolishes the base-unpairing propensity of MARs (14Kohwi-Shigematsu T. Kohwi Y. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 9551-9560Google Scholar). The unpairing potential was demonstrated to be essential for MAR function; a concatemer, wild-type (25Sturrock S.S. Collins J.F. MPsrch. Biocomputing Research Unit, University of Edinburgh, UK1993Google Scholar)7, of the core unwinding element of the 3′ MAR of the immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) enhancer displays high binding affinity to the nuclear matrix, unwinds under superhelical strain, and enhances transcription from a linked reporter gene. A corresponding mutated version, mutated (24Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Google Scholar)8, has lost all of these properties (10Bode J. Kohwi Y. Dickinson L. Joh T. Klehr D. Mielke C. Kohwi-Shigematsu T. Science. 1992; 255: 195-197Google Scholar). To date, three proteins with similar binding specificity have been identified in addition to SATB1: nucleolin, a major nucleolar protein with multiple functions (15Dickinson L.A. Kohwi-Shigematsu T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 456-465Google Scholar), p114, isolated from breast carcinoma (16Yanagisawa J. Ando J. Nakayama J. Kohwi Y. Kohwi-Shigematsu T. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 457-462Google Scholar), and Bright, a protein that is predominantly expressed in B-cells (17Herrscher R.F. Kaplan M.H. Lelsz D.L. Das C. Sheuermann R. Tucker P.W. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 3067-3082Google Scholar). These proteins bind with high affinity to MARs, and we showed that nucleolin and p114 can distinguish wild-type (25Sturrock S.S. Collins J.F. MPsrch. Biocomputing Research Unit, University of Edinburgh, UK1993Google Scholar)5 from mutated (24Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Google Scholar)8. Unlike other proteins known to bind MARs such as lamin B1 (18Ludérus M.E.E. de Graaf A. Mattia E. den Blaauwen J.L. Grande M.A. de Jong L. van Driel R. Cell. 1992; 70: 949-959Google Scholar) and topoisomerase II (19Adachi Y. Käs E. Laemmli U.K. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3997-4006Google Scholar), SATB1 binds MARs with very high affinity, exhibiting dissociation constants (Kd) in the range of 10−9 to 10−10M, comparable to many sequence-specific transcription factors. To understand the biological role of SATB1, it is important to delineate the functional domains in this protein. A minimum 150-amino acid MAR-binding domain that contains novel DNA-binding motifs was previously identified (20Nakagomi K. Kohwi Y. Dickinson L.A. Kohwi-Shigematsu T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1852-1860Google Scholar). We report here that SATB1 contains an additional domain that shares homology with known homeodomains. Homeodomains are 60-amino acid DNA-binding domains, and their amino acid sequence is highly conserved, as well as their three-dimensional structure. Homeodomain proteins function in vitro and in vivo as sequence-specific transcription factors, and they are important developmental regulators that determine position or cell-type specificity (reviewed in Refs. 21Gehring W.J. Science. 1987; 236: 1245-1252Google Scholar and 22Treisman J. Harris E. Wilson D. Desplan C. BioEssays. 1992; : 145-150Google Scholar). Unlike known homeodomains that directly and independently bind DNA, the homeodomain in SATB1 does not bind to the MAR probes analyzed here nor does it bind to a dimerized sequence (RP2) that resembles the homeodomain consensus sequence (23Desplan C. Theis J. O'Farrell P.H. Cell. 1988; 54: 1081-1090Google Scholar). When associated with the MAR-binding domain, however, the SATB1 homeodomain enhances binding specificity toward the core unwinding element of a MAR. We performed searches of the SWISS-PROT data base (release 26.0, August, 1993) using the program Blast (24Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Google Scholar) and Blitz (25Sturrock S.S. Collins J.F. MPsrch. Biocomputing Research Unit, University of Edinburgh, UK1993Google Scholar). Computations were performed using the Blast server at NCBI and the Blitz server at EMBL. Best results were obtained with Blitz searches using the PAM 120 matrix and a gap penalty of 13. To lower the background of nonsignificant matches, it was necessary to remove a segment rich in glutamines and prolines from the query sequence (residues 593-619 of SATB1). The MAR-binding domain was previously delineated by the successive deletion mapping combined with gel mobility shift analysis, and the repeated regions (boxes I and II) were detected by computer-aided sequence comparisons (20Nakagomi K. Kohwi Y. Dickinson L.A. Kohwi-Shigematsu T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1852-1860Google Scholar). Plasmids for the fusion protein expression were constructed as follows. The desired SATB1 fragments were amplified from the human cDNA clone pAT1146 (13Dickinson L.A. Joh T. Kohwi Y. Kohwi-Shigematsu T. Cell. 1992; 70: 631-645Google Scholar) by the polymerase chain reaction using Taq DNA polymerase and the appropriate primers containing a BamHI or EcoRI site. The fragments were isolated from agarose gels, purified by Elutip D columns (Schleicher & Schuell), and cloned in frame in the BamHI or BamHI/EcoRI site of the vector pGEX2T (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). Deletion of the homeodomain was achieved by first synthesizing a fragment ranging from the N-terminal residue of the MAR domain (position 346) to the N-terminal residue of the homeodomain (position 641) and cloning it into BamHI/EcoRI-digested pGEX2T. In a second step, a fragment ranging from the C-terminal residue of the homeodomain (position 702) to the end of the cDNA was amplified and ligated in frame in the EcoRI site downstream of the insert made in the first step. Glutathione S-transferase (GST)-fusion proteins were overexpressed in Escherichia coli (XL1 Blue) and purified on glutathione-Sepharose according to standard procedures (26Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 31-40Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined using a Bradford protein assay kit (Bio-Rad), which was followed by quantitation of the fusion proteins by Coomassie Blue staining of SDS-polyacrylamide gels. To obtain precise comparisons, the different fusion proteins were run side by side on the same gel, and the band intensities were compared by laser densitometer scanning. Gel mobility shift assays were carried out as described (13Dickinson L.A. Joh T. Kohwi Y. Kohwi-Shigematsu T. Cell. 1992; 70: 631-645Google Scholar), with no poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC) added or with 0.5 μg/20 μl. The 3′ MAR is identical to the IgH 3′-En fragment described previously (13Dickinson L.A. Joh T. Kohwi Y. Kohwi-Shigematsu T. Cell. 1992; 70: 631-645Google Scholar). The wild-type 3′ MAR and the mutated fragments were subcloned in the EcoRI site of Bluescript (Stratagene), and the fragments were isolated by EcoRI restriction enzyme digestion and purification from an agarose gel. Pentamer repeats of binding sites V and VI were made exactly as described for wt(25)5 (13Dickinson L.A. Joh T. Kohwi Y. Kohwi-Shigematsu T. Cell. 1992; 70: 631-645Google Scholar), using the following oligonucleotides: 5′-CTTAAAATTACTCTATTATTCGAAttc-3′ with its complementary strand 5′-TTCGAATAATAGAGTAATTTTAAGgaa-3′ for wt(V)5, and 5′-TTCCCTCTGATTATTGGTCTCCATGAAttc-3′ with 5′-TTCATGGAGACCAATAATCAGAGGGAAgaa-3′ for wt(VI)5. The lowercase letters indicate single-stranded overhangs used for end to end ligation of the double-stranded oligonucleotides. Probes for gel mobility shift analysis were prepared by labeling isolated restriction fragments at both ends using Klenow polymerase and [32P]dATP. Under conditions of protein excess, the concentration required for half-maximal binding may be considered an estimate of the equilibrium binding coefficient (27Ekker S.C. Young K.E. von Kessler D. Beachy P.A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1179-1186Google Scholar). Autoradiographs of the gel mobility shift experiments were scanned by laser densitometry, and the percentage of free probe remaining was plotted against the protein concentration in nM. DNA titration experiments were performed as described (28Clemens K.R. Zhang P. Liao X. McBryant S.J. Wright P.E. Gottesfeld J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 244: 23-35Google Scholar) with some modifications. The concentration of the DNA fragment to be labeled was determined using a TKO 100 minifluorometer (Hoefer Scientific Instruments), followed by agarose gel electrophoresis and ethidium bromide staining using a plasmid of known concentration as a standard. The concentration of protein that gave rise to a 40-70% shift at the lowest DNA concentration was determined empirically. All the DNA titrations were done in the presence of 0.5 μg/20 μl of poly(dI-dC). The binding reaction was incubated for 30 min at room temperature to ensure that equilibrium was reached. After electrophoresis the gels were dried and analyzed by a PhosphorImager (Bio-Rad). The single point mutations mut 2 to mut 7, and mut IV of the 3′ MAR were previously described (14Kohwi-Shigematsu T. Kohwi Y. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 9551-9560Google Scholar). Mut V, mut VI, and mut 8 were made by a PCR-based approach using four primer sets (29Higuchi R. Krummel B. Saiki R.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 7351-7367Google Scholar). Briefly, complementary oligonucleotides containing the desired mutations were synthesized, and they were used separately as primers in two PCR reactions with either KS or SK primer from the pBluescript polylinker region flanking the 300-bp 3′ MAR. The two PCR products, one containing the desired mutation at its 5′-end and the other at its 3′-end, were mixed at an equimolar ratio, annealed, and amplified by PCR with both KS and SK primers. The amplified fragments containing the mutation were purified with a Wizard PCR preps system (Promega), digested with EcoRI, and subcloned in the EcoRI site of the vector Bluescript. Mut 8 was confirmed by Sanger sequencing. Mut V and mut VI were confirmed by the presence of an XhoI site in mut V or an SpeI site in mut VI, which were introduced by the multiple point mutations (see Fig. 3A). Alanine substitutions were introduced in the homeodomain following the Exsite PCR-based mutagenesis protocol (Stratagene), with TaqPlus and Pfu polymerase (both from Stratagene) and the pGEX2T plasmid containing the (MD + HD)-encoding insert as template. The mutations were designed to introduce a novel restriction site and were confirmed by restriction enzyme digestion and protein expression. In addition to the MAR-binding domain (residues 346-495) previously reported (20Nakagomi K. Kohwi Y. Dickinson L.A. Kohwi-Shigematsu T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1852-1860Google Scholar), computer-aided homology searches of the Swiss-Prot data base (30Bairoch A. Boeckmann B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3578-3580Google Scholar) identified a homeodomain homology at the C terminus of SATB1 (residues 641-702) (Fig. 1A). Many of the residues that are most conserved among homeodomains are also found in the SATB1 homeodomain, which shares 33% identity with the engrailed class of homeodomains (reviewed in Ref. 31Scott M.P. Tamkun J.W. Hartzell III, G.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 989: 25-48Google Scholar, Fig. 1B). Identities are found with residues that in the x-ray structure of other homeodomains contribute to the hydrophobic core and residues that directly interact with DNA (32Kissinger C.R. Liu B. Martin-Blanco E. Kornberg T.B. Pabo C.O. Cell. 1990; 63: 579-590Google Scholar). This putative homeodomain is, however, divergent. Major differences include a single amino acid insertion at the end of the first helix and a substitution of the highly conserved WFQ motif in the third helix of known homeodomains by FFQ in both human and mouse SATB1. In addition to the homeodomain homology, a set of two repeats was found near the center of SATB1 (residues 370-445 and 493-568), similar to the Cut repeats of the Cut- and Clox-homeo-proteins of Drosophila and mammals, respectively. Cut proteins contain a homeodomain and three additional DNA-binding domains of 73 amino acids, called Cut repeats (33Andrés V. Chiara M.D. Mahdavi V. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 245-257Google Scholar, 34Blochlinger K. Bodmer R. Jack J. Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Nature. 1988; 333: 629-635Google Scholar, 35Harada R. Dufort D. Denis-Larose C. Nepveu A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2062-2067Google Scholar, 36Neufeld E.J. Skalnik D.G. Lievens P.M. Orkin S.H. Nat. Genet. 1992; 1: 50-55Google Scholar). The two Cut-like repeats in SATB1 (named here A and B) contain the previously documented repeats box I (residues 382-415 and 505-538) and box II (429-445 and 552-568), respectively (20Nakagomi K. Kohwi Y. Dickinson L.A. Kohwi-Shigematsu T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1852-1860Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 A and C). Repeat A occurs at the center of the MAR-binding domain of SATB1, but it does not include the N- and C-terminal amino acids that are mandatory for MAR binding (20Nakagomi K. Kohwi Y. Dickinson L.A. Kohwi-Shigematsu T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1852-1860Google Scholar). The two repeats of SATB1 are 45% identical over 75 residues with each other and display 27-35% identity with the Cut repeats. This similarity is considered to be significant, since no gaps were required for optimal alignment (Fig. 1C). Most homeodomain proteins contain a homeodomain as the sole DNA-binding domain. A group of homeodomain proteins have additional domains that assist the homeodomain in DNA binding specificity (reviewed in Refs. 37Gehring W.J. Qian Y.Q. Billeter M. Furukubo-Tokunaga K. Schier A.F. Resendez-Perez D. Affolter M. Otting G. Wüthrich K. Cell. 1994; 78: 211-223Google Scholar and 22Treisman J. Harris E. Wilson D. Desplan C. BioEssays. 1992; : 145-150Google Scholar). In the case of SATB1, the MAR-binding domain by itself is sufficient to recognize and bind a specific region (base-unpairing region) within MARs that has a high propensity for base unpairing, and the homeodomain may have a new role in DNA recognition. To explore this possibility, glutathione S-transferase (GST)-SATB1 fusion proteins were constructed; one protein contained the MAR domain and homeodomain linked together in their natural protein context (GST(MD + HD)); one protein had the 60-amino acid homeodomain specifically deleted (GST(MDΔHD)), and one fusion protein contained the homeodomain separately (GST(HD)) (Fig. 2A). These purified fusion proteins were used in quantitative gel mobility shift experiments with a fixed concentration of a synthetic MAR probe, wild-type (25Sturrock S.S. Collins J.F. MPsrch. Biocomputing Research Unit, University of Edinburgh, UK1993Google Scholar)5, and increasing protein concentrations. This probe was derived from the core unwinding element of the MAR located 3′ of the IgH enhancer, and it has the same properties as a natural MAR (10Bode J. Kohwi Y. Dickinson L. Joh T. Klehr D. Mielke C. Kohwi-Shigematsu T. Science. 1992; 255: 195-197Google Scholar). Fig. 2B shows the gel mobility shift experiments and the binding curves that were derived from these autoradiographs. Each of these and the following gel shift experiments were repeated at least three times giving similar results. The isolated HD showed virtually no binding activity for the wt(25)5 probe; however, when HD was associated with MD (MD + HD), the binding affinity was approximately 10 times higher (Kd = 0.1 nM) than for MDΔHD (Kd = 1.0 nM). The affinity of MDΔ HD toward wt(25)5 was virtually identical to that of the isolated MD alone (GST(MD)), indicating that the C-terminal animo acids from 496 to 763 besides HD have no additional contribution toward binding to wt(25)5 (data not shown). HD weakly bound to longer MAR fragments, but this activity was mainly nonspecific, since it could be competed by nonspecific competitors (data not shown). This effect of the homeodomain on binding affinity was confirmed by additional DNA titration experiments, in which the dissociation constants were determined using a fixed protein concentration and increasing concentrations of the DNA probe (Fig. 2C). Dissociation constants determined in this manner are independent of minor variations in the protein concentration determination or the amount of active protein in the protein preparation. The results obtained from gel mobility shift experiments were quantitated using a PhosphorImager, and the Kd values were calculated from the least squares fit of a Scatchard plot of bound/free DNA as a function of bound DNA. The approximate Kd values were estimated from the negative reciprocal of the slope, and the Kd for MD + HD (0.06 nM) was approximately 7 times lower than for MDΔHD (0.4 nM) (Fig. 2C). The dissociation constants determined by protein titration or DNA titration were similar, indicating that nearly all the protein in the protein sample was in an active form. SATB1 binds a variety of MARs from different species and selectively recognizes sites within MARs that are prone to become stably base-unpaired under negative superhelical strain (13Dickinson L.A. Joh T. Kohwi Y. Kohwi-Shigematsu T. Cell. 1992; 70: 631-645Google Scholar). 2L. A. Dickinson and T. Kohwi-Shigematsu, unpublished results. The structural properties and the SATB1 binding sites of the 5′ MAR and the 3′ MAR, which flank the IgH enhancer, were previously characterized (13Dickinson L.A. Joh T. Kohwi Y. Kohwi-Shigematsu T. Cell. 1992; 70: 631-645Google Scholar, 14Kohwi-Shigematsu T. Kohwi Y. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 9551-9560Google Scholar) (Fig. 3A). These natural MARs were used as probes in quantitative gel mobility shift experiments to determine whether HD can increase binding affinity to MARs in general. When the 5′ MAR fragment was used as probe, HD had no effect on the binding affinity, both MD + HD and MDΔHD exhibited nearly equal affinity to the 5′ MAR (Kd = 7 and 10 nM, respectively) (Fig. 3B). In the case of the 3′ MAR, however, the association of HD with MD increased the affinity by 6-fold compared with MD alone; the dissociation constants (Kd) for MD + HD and MDΔHD were 2.5 and 15 nM, respectively (Fig. 3B). This differential effect of the homeodomain could be due to the different structural properties that distinguish these two MARs. Both MARs contain a base-unpairing region, but only the IgH 3′ MAR has a core unwinding element. The unwinding propensity is much greater for the 3′ MAR than the 5′ MAR; in a supercoiled plasmid, significant unwinding can be detected in the 5′ MAR only when the 3′ MAR is deleted (14Kohwi-Shigematsu T. Kohwi Y. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 9551-9560Google Scholar). The core unwinding element is defined as a short discrete site that resists base pairing even under conditions that greatly favor a double-stranded configuration, and mutation of these sites results in a complete loss of the unwinding propensity of the MAR. Previous missing nucleoside experiments (13Dickinson L.A. Joh T. Kohwi Y. Kohwi-Shigematsu T. Cell. 1992; 70: 631-645Google Scholar) showed that SATB1 directly contacts three sites in the 5′ MAR (sites I, II, and III) when the isolated 5′ MAR was used as a substrate. Using the 3′ MAR as a substrate, three adjacent ATC sequence stretches (sites IV, V, and VI) were detected as the SATB1 contact sites (Fig. 3A). Binding site IV overlaps with the core unwinding element and is the major binding site, since SATB1 makes contacts with sites V and VI only when site IV is mutated and is no longer bound (13Dickinson L.A. Joh T. Kohwi Y. Kohwi-Shigematsu T. Cell. 1992; 70: 631-645Google Scholar). To determine whether the homeodomain in SATB1 contributes to this preferential recognition of site IV, we used mutated MAR fragments as probes in gel mobility shift experiments with GST(MD + HD) and GST(MDΔHD). Each of these mutated MARs had one of the three sites destroyed by mutation and two sites intact (Fig. 3A). The affinity of the MAR-binding domain alone (MDΔHD) to each of the three mutated fragments was nearly the same as to wild-type 3′ MAR with estimated Kd values of 15, 20, 22, and 12 nM for 3′ MAR, mut IV, mutV, and mut VI, respectively (Fig. 3B, only the results for wild-type 5′- and 3′ MARs and mut IV are shown). This result indicates that the MAR domain, in the absence of the homeodomain, cannot effectively distinguish among the three sites in the ATC sequence cluster. Regardless of which site was mutated, binding by (MDΔHD) was unaffected. On the other hand, the presence of the homeodomain together with the MAR-binding domain (MD + HD) exhibited a significantly reduced binding affinity to mut IV (Kd = 14 nM) compared with wild-type 3′ MAR (Kd = 2.5 nM) (Fig. 3B). No significant decrease in binding affinity was detected for MD + HD to mut V or mut VI compared with wild type, as long as site IV remained intact (data not shown). These results also show that the HD-mediated increase in affinity to the 3′ MAR does not merely reflect a cooperativity of binding, caused by the presence of adjacent binding sites. If this were the case, any one of the three mutations would be expected to abolish the effect of the homeodomain and not just mutation of site IV. In fact, binding of (MD + HD) is virtually noncooperative, since a Hill coefficient of 1.2 was determined. On the contrary, the weaker binding of (MDΔHD) to 3′ MAR appears to be cooperative, with a Hill coefficient of 2.2 (data not shown). The contribution of the homeodomain in directing SATB1 to the core unwinding element was further confirmed by employing concatemers of each site with short surrounding sequences as probes in gel mobility shift experiments (data not shown). The concatemer wt(IV)5 is identical to the previously described synthetic MAR wild type (25Sturrock S.S. Collins J.F. MPsrch. Biocomputing Research Unit, University of Edinburgh, UK1993Google Scholar)5 (10Bode J. Kohwi Y. Dickinson L. Joh T. Klehr D. Mielke C. Kohwi-Shigematsu T. Science. 1992; 255: 195-197Google Scholar). If the homeodomain does assist the MAR-binding domain to preferentially recognize the core unwinding element, it should specifically increase affinity to wt(IV)5 but not to wt(V)5 or wt(VI)5. Indeed, the increase in binding affinity observed with (MD + HD) compared with (MDΔHD) was 10-fold for wt(IV)5 but less than 2-fold for wt(V)5 and wt(VI)5 (data not shown). Thus, the homeodomain of SATB1 contributes to binding specificity by selectively increasing the affinity to site IV that contains the wild-type core unwinding element. It should be noted that, although the MAR-binding domain alone cannot distinguish among the three sites in the natural context of the 3′ MAR, when each binding site was concatemerized and used separately as probe, (MDΔHD) showed moderate preference for site IV over site V and site VI. This preference for site IV, how"

Recombinant NDH II unwound both DNA and RNA. Limited tryptic digestion produced active helicases with molecular masses of 130 and 100 kDa. The 130-kDa helicase missed a glycine-rich domain (RGG-box) at the carboxyl terminus, while the 100-kDa form missed both its double-stranded RNA binding domains (dsRBDs) at the amino terminus and its RGG-box.

Grosse F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20483-20490Google Scholar). Subsequently, it was shown that NDH II also contains RNA helicase activity (2Zhang S. Grosse F. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3906-3912Google Scholar). The cDNA sequence of NDH II (3Zhang S. Maacke H. Grosse F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16422-16427Google Scholar) revealed a high homology to two previously known proteins, namely human RNA helicase A (4Lee C.-G. Hurwitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16822-16830Google Scholar) and the Drosophila “maleless” protein (MLE) (5Kuroda M.I. Kernan M.J. Kreber R. Ganetzky B. Baker B.S. Cell. 1991; 66: 935-947Google Scholar). From the cDNA sequences it was also deduced that the three proteins belong to the superfamily of DEXH helicases, all members of which possess seven conserved helicase motifs in the putative catalytically active core. The presence of the DEXH helicase core domain suggests a function in RNA and/or DNA unwinding for all three members of this superfamily. The core contains an ATP binding site with the consensus sequence GCGKT (A site) and FILDD (B site) in motif I as well as a putative nucleic acid binding region QRKGRAGR in motif VI. In addition to the core, all three helicases have further nucleic acid binding motifs localized at either end of the molecule. human nuclear DNA helicase II heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein polymerase chain reaction amino acid(s) base pair(s) nitrolotriacetic acid glutathione S-transferase polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis single-stranded DNA single-stranded RNA double-stranded DNA double-stranded RNA binding domain.

The carboxyl-terminal 100 amino acids of NDH II consist of a consecutive stretch of glycines that is regularly interrupted by either aromatic amino acids or arginine. Similar RGG-rich sequences (RGG-boxes) have been found as part of many nucleic acid-binding proteins, such as the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins hnRNP A1 (13Cobianchi F. SenGupta D.N.

A. 1993; 90: 9300-9304Google Scholar). Except hnRNP U, where the RGG-box is the only nucleic acid binding domain (14Kiledjian M. Dreyfuss G. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2655-2664Google Scholar), RGG-boxes cooperate with other domains to achieve an increased affinity for nucleic acids. Here, we have designed and produced various mutants of NDH II to delineate the modular structure of this enzyme with particular emphasis on the amino- and carboxyl-terminally localized nucleic acid binding domains. Our results confirm the importance of the dsRNA binding domains by showing that they influence both ATPase and helicase activities. Furthermore, the RGG-box at the COOH terminus enhances nucleic acid binding and may be required for an increased unwinding efficiency of the helicase core domain. A Bluescript plasmid vector containing full-length cDNA of human NDH II was obtained from a λ-Zap cDNA library of human T-cells primed with oligo(dT) or primed randomly (Stratagene). The library was screened with a cDNA probe for bovine NDH II (3Zhang S. Maacke H. Grosse F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16422-16427Google Scholar) that was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP (Amersham Corp.). Hybridization was performed under conditions of low stringency (24Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1989: 8.47Google Scholar). Subcloning and DNA sequencing was essentially as described earlier for bovine NDH II (3Zhang S. Maacke H. Grosse F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16422-16427Google Scholar). The sequence data have been deposited at the GenBank™/EMBL Data Bank under accession number Y10658. Full-length NDH II as well as several deletion mutants were constructed with bacmid vectors (Life Technologies, Inc.). For this, NH2- and COOH-terminal parts of the cDNA were amplified by PCR and then combined (see Fig. 9). The translation initiation codon ATG and the sequence information for six histidine residues were introduced into the NH2-terminal forward primers; the COOH-terminal reverse primers were provided with stop codons. PCR primers at both ends also contained a unique BamHI restriction site. The following PCR primers were used: F-1, starting at the initiating codon ATG (5′-CGTATCCAGCACCCATGGGCCATCATCATCATCATCATATGGGTGACGTTAAAAATTTTCTG-3′); F-2, corresponding to a start at amino acid residue (aa) 131 (5′-CGTATCCAGCACCCATGGGCCATCATCATCATCATCATGGCTATGGTGTTCCTGGG-3′); and F-3, corresponding to a start at aa 313 (5′- CGTATCCAGCACCCATGGGCCATCATCATCATCATCATGGCAAATTGGCTCAGTTC-3′). The three reverse primers for the COOH terminus were R-1, corresponding to a start at aa 952 (5′-CCTTAGTCGA); R-2, corresponding to a start at aa 1160 (5′-CCTTAGTCGATCAACGTGGACCATCTCCATA-3′); and R-3, starting from the natural stop codon TAA at codon 1270 (5′-CCTTAGTCGATCAATAGCCGCCACCTCCTCT-3′). The NH2-terminal PCR fragments were synthesized with primers F-1 and F-2 and a cDNA primer that was situated downstream from the unique restriction site HindIII at nucleotide position 770. The PCR product beginning with F-3 was built-up with another internal primer that bypassed the restriction site ScaI at nucleotide position 1575 (see Fig. 9). At the COOH terminus, the reverse primers R-1 and R-2 were combined with an upstream cDNA primer yielding PCR products that contained the SacI site at nucleotide position 2336. R-3 was used with another internal primer to pass the PstI site at nucleotide position 3193 (see Fig. 9). For subcloning, PCR products encoding the NH2 terminus could be digested with HindIII or ScaI, while PCR products encoding the COOH terminus could be cleaved by SacI or PstI. The NH2- and COOH-terminal PCR fragments were ligated to the central cDNA fragments bordered by HindIII and SacI (1566 bp), HindIII-PstI (2423 bp), ScaI-SacI (761 bp), and ScaI-PstI (1618 bp). All PCR products were digested with BamHI and ligated into the donor plasmid pFastBAC1 by using the BamHI restriction site downstream of the polyhedrin promotor. The directionality of the inserts was determined by PCR using the forward primer 5′-AAAATGATAACCATCTCGCAAA-3′ and insert-specific internal primers for the retrograde strand. Recombinant bacmids were produced according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Life Technologies, Inc.). Recombinant bacmids were transfected into Sf9 insect cells in the presence of Cellfectin (Life Technologies, Inc.); supernatants from transfected cells were collected after 48-72 h. Virus stocks were prepared with a multiplicity of infection of 0.01-0.1. Baculovirus stocks from human NDH II vectors were used to infect 1-2.5 · 108Sf9 cells in 10-25 culture dishes (140 mm in diameter) at a multiplicity of infection of 1-5. Cells were harvested 40-48 h postinfection and washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (10 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 140 mM NaCl, 3 mM KCl). Whole cell extracts were prepared at 4°C by homogenizing the cells in 2 ml of hypotonic buffer A (25 mM HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 10 mM NaCl, 10 mM Na2S2O5, 5 mM MgCl2, 7 mMβ-mercaptoethanol, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 0.1% (v/v) Trasylol (Bayer-Leverkusen, Germany)) followed by a 30-min incubation with the same volume of high salt buffer B (25 mM HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 1 M NaCl, 10 mM Na2S2O5, 5 mM MgCl2, 1.6 mM imidazole, 7 mMβ-mercaptoethanol, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1% Trasylol, and 30% glycerol). The extracts were centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 15 min. The supernatants were carefully removed and mixed with 250-500 μl of Ni2+-NTA-agarose (Qiagen) under gentle agitation for 45 min. Recombinant proteins, which bound to the nickel column, were purified by centrifugation at 1500 × g for 3 min followed by a series of wash steps with 0.8, 5, 20, and 40 mM imidazole present in 5 ml of buffer C (25 mM HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 0.5 M NaCl, 10 mM Na2S2O5, 5 mM MgCl2, 7 mMβ-mercaptoethanol, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1% Trasylol, and 15% glycerol). Proteins were eluted at 80 mM and at 300 mM imidazole with three bed volumes of buffer C. The imidazole-eluted fractions with a complete NH2 terminus (including full-length NDH II) were dialyzed overnight at 4°C against buffer D (20 mM HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 50 mM NaCl, 10 mM Na2S2O5, 7 mMβ-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol) and then loaded onto poly(rI·rC)-agarose (500 μl) preequilibrated with buffer D. The columns were washed with 1.5 ml of buffer D, and the proteins were eluted by increasing the NaCl concentration stepwise with 100 mM increments from 0.1 to 1 M and a subsequent wash with 2 M NaCl in buffer D. NDH II constructs containing a complete NH2 terminus eluted between 0.6 and 2 M NaCl. These fractions were combined, dialyzed against buffer E (20 mM HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 10 mM Na2S2O5, 7 mMβ-mercaptoethanol), concentrated, and stored at −70°C in the presence of 50% glycerol. The fragment containing the DEXH core domain alone was purified on Ni2+-NTA-agarose. For further purification this protein was dialyzed against buffer D at 4°C; then it was applied to 250 μl of phosphocellulose P-11 (Whatman) equilibrated with buffer D. The protein in the flow-through was dialyzed against buffer C (25 mM HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 0.5 M NaCl, 10 mM Na2S2O5, 5 mM MgCl2, 7 mMβ-mercaptoethanol, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1% Trasylol, and 15% glycerol) and loaded onto a second Ni2+-NTA-agarose column (250 μl). Loading was repeated three times, and then the protein was eluted with 300 mM imidazole in buffer C. Protein of the second nickel column was dialyzed against buffer E containing 50% glycerol and stored at −70°C. Amino- and carboxyl-terminal domains of human NDH II were expressed in E. coli as GST fusion proteins (see Figs. 7A and 8A) by using pGEX-2T as plasmid vector (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). The corresponding gene fragments were synthesized by PCR from a cDNA encoding full-length human NDH II. The following primers were used: 5′-CGTATCCAGCATGGGTGACGTTAAAAATTTTCTG-3′ (sense) and 5′-CTTAGGATCTAGAGGCCCCTACCTCAGAATTATT-3′ (antisense) for aa 1-130, corresponding to dsRBD I; 5′-CGTATCCAGCATGGGTGACGTTAAAAATTTTCTG-3′ (sense) and 5′-CTTAGGATCTGAACTGAGCCAATTTGCC-3′ (antisense) for aa 1-318, corresponding to dsRBD I and II; 5′-CGTATCCAGCGGCTATGGTGTTCCTGGG-3′ (sense) and 5′-CTTAGGATCTGAACTGAGCCAATTTGCC-3′ (antisense) for aa 131-318, corresponding to dsRBD II; 5′-CGTATCCAGCACCTGGGAAGCCAAAGTTCAG-3′ (sense) and 5′-CTTAGGATCTACGTGGACCATCTCCATA-3′ (antisense) for aa 953-1160, corresponding to the carboxyl-terminal extension of the DEXH core; 5′-CGTATCCAGCACCTGGGAAGCCAAAGTTCAG-3′ (sense) and 5′-CTTAGGATCTATAGCCGCCACCTCCTCT-3′ (antisense) for aa 953-1269, corresponding to the DEXH core extension plus the RGG-box; and finally 5′-CGTATCCAGCCCTCCCAAGATGGCCCGA-3′ (sense), and 5′-CTTAGGATCTATAGCCGCCACCTCCTCT-3′ (antisense) for aa 1161-1269, corresponding to the RGG-box alone. All sense primers contained a BamHI restriction site, and the antisense primers contained an EcoRI restriction site, both underlined. The PCR products were digested with BamHI and EcoRI, gel-purified, and ligated with the correspondingly treated pGEX-2T vector. Recombinant pGEX-2T plasmids were transformed into the E. coli strain TG-1; the plasmid inserts were sequenced. Transfected E. coli TG-1 bacteria were grown in 200 ml of LB culture in the presence of 50 μg/ml ampicillin to an A600value of 0.6-0.8. The expression of recombinant proteins was induced by adding 0.5 mM isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside. Three hours after induction, the bacteria were collected by centrifugation, resuspended in 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline, and finally lysed by sonication on ice. The lysate was centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 10 min, and the supernatant was mixed with a 1-ml bed volume of glutathione Sepharose 4B (Pharmacia) that had been preequilibrated with phosphate-buffered saline. GST fusion proteins were batch-purified according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Purified fusion proteins were stored at −70°C. Northwestern blot assays were performed as described (11St. Johnston D. Brown N.H. Gall J.G. Jantsch M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10979-10983Google Scholar). Bacterial lysates from each mutant protein were prepared by suspending bacteria from 2 ml of LB medium into 500 μl of SDS-PAGE loading buffer followed by sonication. Five-μl fractions of the supernatants were electrophoresed through a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and electrotransferred to a Hybond-C nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham). The membrane was incubated with 8 M urea in Tris-buffered saline (25 mM Tris, 140 mM NaCl, and 3 mM KCl). To achieve protein renaturation, there followed 10 steps of 2:3 dilutions with Tris-buffered saline. Nonspecific binding sites were blocked by treating the membrane with 5% (w/v) milk powder in probing buffer (25 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 10 mM HEPES, pH 8.0, 0.1 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol) for 1 h at room temperature. Then one of the 32P-labeled RNA probes, poly(rI·rC), poly(rI), or poly(rC) (Pharmacia), was added in probing buffer. The membrane was incubated for another 30 min at room temperature. Washes were performed by three changes of probing buffer within 15 min. The membranes were exposed to x-ray film overnight at −80°C. About 250-500 μg of human NDH II-derived NH2- and COOH-terminal GST fusion products were purified by chromatography on glutathione-Sepharose 4B and then loaded onto 250 μl of either poly(rI·rC)-agarose or ssDNA-agarose (Pharmacia). The columns were equilibrated with binding buffer containing HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM dithiothreitol, and 1 mM EDTA. The columns were washed with 0.75 ml of binding buffer and then eluted with 100 mM, 200 mM, 300 mM, 500 mM, 1 M, and 2 M NaCl in binding buffer. 500-μl fractions were taken at each NaCl concentration, and 25 μl thereof were further processed for 10% SDS-PAGE. After electrophoresis, the proteins were visualized by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Alternatively, 0.5-10 μl of the baculovirus-expressed proteins were purified on Ni2+-NTA-agarose and mixed with 30 μl of either poly(rI·rC)-agarose or ssDNA-agarose that was preequilibrated with 50 mM, 100 mM, 200 mM, 300 mM, 500 mM, and 1 M NaCl in binding buffer. After incubation for 30 min at room temperature, the agarose beads were spun down at 15,000 rpm for 5 min, washed extensively with 20-25 bed volumes of binding buffer with the corresponding NaCl concentration, and finally resuspended in 30 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer for protein elution. Ten μl of each of the supernatant fractions were heated to 95°C for 3 min, centrifuged, and then electrophoresed through an 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. After transfer to a Hybond-C nitrocellulose membrane, proteins were detected with a 1:1000 dilution of rabbit antiserum against human RNA helicase A in an enhanced chemoluminescence procedure (ECL, Amersham). Recombinant full-length human NDH II (500 ng) was digested with trypsin at a weight ratio of trypsin to NDH II of 1:5, 1:50, and 1:500, respectively, in 10 μl of 20 mM HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 50 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, and 1 mM dithiothreitol. Digestions were performed at 37°C for 30 and 60 min. Then the digestion mixtures were mixed with 5 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer and heated to 95°C for 5 min. Tryptic products were analyzed by electrophoresis on an 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Preparation of RNA helicase and DNA helicase substrates as well as enzyme assays for nucleic acid-dependent NTPase activity, RNA helicase activity, and DNA helicase activity were performed as described (2Zhang S. Grosse F. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3906-3912Google Scholar). Nuclear DNA helicase II was previously isolated from bovine tissue according to its DNA unwinding property and later shown to unwind RNA as well (1Zhang S. Grosse F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20483-20490Google Scholar, 2Zhang S. Grosse F. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3906-3912Google Scholar). Molecular cloning of the NDH II-encoding gene revealed a high homology to human RNA helicase A (3Zhang S. Maacke H. Grosse F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16422-16427Google Scholar, 4Lee C.-G. Hurwitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16822-16830Google Scholar), which was described to unwind only RNA but not DNA (25Lee C.-G. Hurwitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4398-4407Google Scholar). To redetermine the substrate specificity of human NDH II, the gene was cloned. This independently cloned cDNA sequence was very similar to the recently modified sequence of human RNA helicase A (PIR accession number Q08211), with the exception of two missense exchanges (Q970E and K1036N) and a slightly altered COOH terminus (Fig. 1). The cDNA of human NDH II was provided with the sequence information for six NH2-terminal histidine residues and expressed in insect cells by using a baculovirus-based expression system. Recombinant NDH II was purified on a Ni2+-NTA-agarose column and subsequent chromatography on poly(rI·rC) agarose. The purified enzyme had the expected molecular mass of 140 kDa, i.e. it was clearly bigger than the previously isolated forms of bovine NDH II (Fig. 2). As its bovine homologue, the recombinant human enzyme unwound both dsRNA and double-stranded DNA in an ATP-dependent manner (Fig. 3). Bovine NDH II preparations usually consisted of two distinct protein bands with apparent molecular masses of 130 and 100 kDa that were active in both DNA and RNA unwinding (1Zhang S. Grosse F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20483-20490Google Scholar, 2Zhang S. Grosse F. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3906-3912Google Scholar). To define a smaller form of the protein that still contains its unwinding activity, we attempted to digest recombinant NDH II in a controlled manner. A digestion pattern comparable with that of bovine NDH II could be produced by limited tryptic digestion. When the weight ratio of trypsin to NDH II was adjusted to 1:500, only the 130-kDa form of the enzyme was generated (Fig. 2, lanes 6 and 7), while a ratio of 1:50 produced both the 130- and the 100-kDa forms of the protein (Fig. 2, lanes 8 and 9). Proteolyzed human NDH II bound to poly(rI·rC), comparable with the bovine homologue, with the 100-kDa form eluting at 0.2-0.3 M NaCl and the 130-kDa form eluting at about 0.5 M NaCl (Fig. 4). These differences in the chromatographic behavior allowed a separation of the tryptic digestion products from each other. Both tryptic forms of human NDH II were active in DNA and RNA unwinding (data not shown). The course of digestion was further analyzed by probing the products with an anti-histidine antibody that specifically recognized the NH2 terminus. The 130-kDa form reacted well with anti-histidine antibody (Fig. 5), indicating that it contained an intact amino terminus. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that the carboxyl-terminal amino acids representing the RGG-box were removed first. In contrast, the 100-kDa product did not react with this antibody, revealing the deletion of at least the NH2-terminal histidine tag. At most, 30 kDa (∼270 amino acids) might have been removed from the NH2 terminus as the second tryptic cutting event. This region would contain both dsRBDs that have been attributed to the amino acid residues 3-72 and 180-253, respectively (Fig. 7) (6Gibson T.J. Thompson J.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 2552-2556Google Scholar). It was surprising that full-length NDH II reacted more weakly with the anti-histidine antibody than the COOH-terminally deleted form (Fig. 5). A more quantitative treatment of the influence of COOH- and NH2-terminal deletions on the unwinding properties of NDH II was difficult to accomplish, mainly because minor differences in nucleic acid unwinding were hard to quantify. Therefore, the nucleic acid-dependent ATPase activity was taken as an indicator for the unwinding activity of NDH II. The ATPase activities of the 130- and 100-kDa forms were stimulated by poly(rI·rC) and by ssDNA (Fig. 6). With these effectors, the turnover rate of ATP hydrolysis was about 1.5-2-fold higher for the 100-kDa tryptic product than for the 130-kDa form (Fig. 6). Hence, once the RGG-box has been removed, the subsequent removal of parts of the NH2 terminus stimulated ATP hydrolysis. To study the relative contribution of either of the potential dsRNA binding domains at the amino terminus to nucleic acid binding, dsRBDs I and II were expressed in E. coli as three GST fusion proteins comprising the amino acid residues 1-130 (dsRBD I), 131-318 (dsRBD II), and 1-318 (dsRBD I + II) (Fig. 7A). The RNA binding abilities of all three polypeptides were determined by chromatography on a poly(rI·rC)-agarose column. All three constructs bound well to the dsRNA column. GST-dsRBD I and dsRBD II began to elute at 0.5 M NaCl, while the elution of the construct with both dsRBDs started at 1 M NaCl (Fig. 7B). All three constructs bound also to a single-stranded DNA cellulose column, where GST-dsRBD I and GST-dsRBD II became eluted between 0.2 and 0.3 M NaCl, whereas the GST-dsRBD I + II construct came off between 0.3 and 1 M (data not shown). The higher salt resistance of binding of dsRBD I + II in comparison to dsRBD I and dsRBD II suggests a cooperation of the two domains for nucleic acid binding. A cooperation was also deduced from Northwestern blot experiments, where the individual domains gave much weaker binding signals with poly(rI)·(rC) than the construct having both domains present (data not shown). To study the nucleic acid binding properties of the carboxyl terminus, three C-terminal fragments of NDH II were expressed as GST fusion proteins (Fig. 8A). Binding of these fusion products to dsRNA and ssRNA was analyzed by Northwestern assays. Both RGG-box-containing fusion proteins bound to poly(rI) and poly(rI·rC), while the fragment comprising aa 953-1160 (without an RGG-box) did not display binding to either nucleic acid (Fig. 8B). The RGG-box-containing fusion proteins were eluted with 50-100 mM salt from a poly(rI·rC)-agarose column (data not shown). Hence, this type of binding was highly salt-sensitive and may have been caused by electrostatic interactions. In striking contrast, the RGG-box-containing fragments bound strongly to ssDNA-agarose, even in the presence of 1-2 M NaCl (data not shown). Full-length human NDH II comprising aa 1-1269 as well as the truncated fragments shown in Fig. 9A were all expressed in insect cells by using recombinant baculoviruses. Each of the recombinant proteins carried an N-terminal histidine tag to allow an easy purification on nickel columns. The yield of the purified proteins varied considerably between the different recombinants, most likely because some of the proteins were rapidly degraded. All recombinant proteins were analyzed by Western blotting with serum against human RNA helicase A. The observed molecular weights were in accordance with the calculated ones (Fig. 9B). The nucleic acid binding affinities of the recombinant proteins, were probed by binding to poly(rI·rC)-agarose (Fig. 10). Full-length NDH II (data not shown) as well as the DEXH helicase core domain (aa 313-952) bound dsRNA even in the presence of 1 M NaCl (Fig. 10, left). Comparable binding was observed when the complete NH2 terminus was fused to the core domain (Fig. 10, middle). However, when only the dsRBD II domain was fused to the core, a reduced binding to dsRNA resulted (Fig. 10, right). Binding could not be further increased when the amino acids 953-1160 were fused to the dsRBD II-core construct (data not shown). All these constructs bound comparably well to ssDNA-cellulose. While the RGG-box hardly had an influence on RNA binding, binding to ssDNA was best with all constructs that contained an RGG-box (data not shown). Baculovirus-expressed NDH II as well as the NDH II fragments consisting of aa 1-952, 313-952, and 313-1269, were purified on nickel-agarose and poly(rI·rC)-agarose (Fig. 6A). With these proteins as well as the tryptic products, shown in Fig. 4, ATPase assays were performed in the presence of poly(rI·rC), MS-2 phage ssRNA, and M13mp18 ssDNA (Fig. 6B). The ATPase activity of full-length NDH II was most stimulated by poly(rI·rC), followed by ssRNA from the bacteriophage MS2, followed by ssDNA from the bacteriophage M13. Furthermore, both tryptic products, p100 and p130, displayed nucleic acid-dependent ATPase activities, which however seemed to be less well stimulated by MS-2 RNA. In contrast, the amino-terminal part of NDH II, including the DEXH core, and the DEXH core alone were devoid of nucleic acid-stimulated ATPase activity, although all these constructs were able to bind RNA and DNA and all contained a Walker-type ATP binding site. In agreement with the failure to observe nucleic acid-stimulated ATPase activity, neither of the truncated products could unwind RNA or DNA (data not shown). Nuclear DNA helicase II was originally purified"

When R3 protein was dissociated from DNA with isopropyl beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside, the R3-induced nucleosome positions remained unchanged for at least 60 minutes in the absence of ATP but rearranged within 15 minutes in the presence of ATP. These results suggest that nucleosomes are dynamic and mobile rather than static and that a DNA binding factor is continuously required for the maintenance of nucleosome positioning."
https://openalex.org/W2077857663,"We previously showed that consensus sequences exist at the chromosomal breakpoints in lymphoid malignancies and that these sequences are specifically recognized by a novel DNA binding protein, Translin. In the present study, the native form of Translin was established to be a ring-shaped structure by electron microscopy and crystallographic studies. It was also determined that this multimeric Translin formed by the subunits is responsible for its binding to target sequences situated only at single-stranded DNA ends. Furthermore, DNA-damaging reagents were found to initiate a signaling pathway for the active nuclear transport of Translin. The results support the hypothesis that staggered breaks occur at recombination hot spots and Translin has a pivotal function in recognition of the generated single-stranded DNA ends."

Fields B.N. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Virology. 3rd Ed. Lippincott-Raven Press, Philadelphia1996: 2901-2950Google Scholar). These disorders are characterized clinically by dementia and motor dysfunction and neuropathologically by spongiform degeneration of the brain and in some cases by the presence of cerebral amyloid plaques. Prion diseases can have an infectious, familial, or sporadic origin. The infectious etiology is exemplified by kuru, which was spread among members of an aboriginal tribe by ritual cannibalism (2Gajdusek D.C. Fields B.N. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Virology. 3rd Ed. Lippincott-Raven Press, Philadelphia1996: 2851-2900Google Scholar), and by “new variant” CJD which may have arisen by consumption of beef from cows afflicted with bovine spongiform encephalopathy (3Will R.G. Ironside J.W. Zeidler M. Cousens S.N. Estibeiro K. Alperovitch A. Poser S. Pocchiari M. Hofman A. Smith P.G. Lancet. 1996; 347: 921-925Google Scholar). Familial forms, which include Gerstmann-Sträussler syndrome, fatal familial insomnia, and 10% of the cases of CJD, show an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance linked to insertional and point mutations in the gene encoding the prion protein (PrP) (4Parchi P.

The central pathogenic event in prion diseases is thought to be a conformational transition that changes PrPC, a normal cell surface protein of unknown function, into PrPSc, the principal component of infectious prion particles (1Prusiner S.B.

Ernst D. Hayes S.F. Caughey W.S. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 7672-7680Google Scholar, 7Safar J. Roller P.P. Gajdusek D.C. Gibbs C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20276-20284Google Scholar, 8Pan K.M.

However, many mechanistic details of the conversion process remain obscure. First, the nature of the interaction between PrPSc and PrPC is poorly understood. A physical association between the two isoforms during the infectious process is suggested by the exquisite primary sequence specificity of prion transmission (9Prusiner S.B. Scott M. Foster D. Pan K.M. Groth D. Mirenda C. Torchia M. Yang S.L. Serban D. Carlson G.A. Hoppe P.C. Westaway D. DeArmond S.J. Cell. 1990; 63: 673-686Google Scholar, 10Scott M. Groth D. Foster D. Torchia M.

Virol. 1995; 69: 7754-7758Google Scholar) and by the recent demonstration that PrPSc-like molecules can be generated in vitro by mixing purified PrPC with PrPSc or with synthetic PrP peptides (12Kocisko D.A.

Cohen F.E. Baldwin M.A. Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11160-11164Google Scholar). However, a PrPC-PrPSc conversion intermediate has never been isolated from cells, and there is considerable debate about the whether the conversion process is best modeled as a nucleated polymerization (12Kocisko D.A. Come J.H. Priola S.A. Chesebro B. Raymond G.J. Landsbury P.T. Caughey B. Nature. 1994; 370: 471-474Google Scholar, 14Jarrett J.T. Landsbury P.T.

Immunol. 1996; 207: 49-67Google Scholar), or some combination of the two mechanisms. Second, it is unclear how the hypothesized change in PrP conformation alters the experimentally observed properties of the protein. Whether the conversion of PrPC to infectious PrPSc occurs in an all-or-nothing fashion or proceeds via a series of identifiable molecular intermediates is unknown. Third, there is uncertainty about the cellular compartments involved in generation of PrPSc. Evidence from scrapie-infected cells in culture implicates the plasma membrane, endocytic organelles, as well as cholesterol-rich microdomains as relevant sites (18Caughey B. Raymond G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18217-18223Google Scholar, 19Borchelt D.R. Taraboulos A. Prusiner S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16188-16199Google Scholar, 20Taraboulos A. Scott M. Semenov A. Avraham D. Laszlo L.

A. 1996; 93: 14945-14949Google Scholar), but it is unclear which of these is most important and whether compartments along the secretory pathway might also be involved. Finally, it remains to be determined what molecules other than PrP itself might be important in the conversion process. Although structural features intrinsic to PrP probably play a critical role in the prion phenomenon, cellular cofactors may function to enhance or modulate PrPSc formation, as suggested by the inefficiency of existing in vitro conversion systems (12Kocisko D.A.

Torchia M. Cohen F.E. DeArmond S.J. Prusiner S.B. Cell. 1995; 83: 79-90Google Scholar). To address these mechanistic issues, it is necessary to analyze prion formation in cultured cells that are amenable to experimental manipulations such as pulse labeling, microscopy, and subcellular fractionation. Scrapie-infected neuroblastoma cells and immortalized hamster brain cells have been invaluable in elucidating some of the cellular and biochemical events underlying the infectious manifestation of prion diseases (18Caughey B.

Richardson S.L. Urig C.B. Gambetti P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12661-12668Google Scholar) have now developed such a model. Our system utilizes transfected lines of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells that stably express mouse PrP (moPrP) molecules carrying mutations homologous to those linked to inherited prion diseases of humans. We find that mutant PrPs synthesized in these cells display many of the biochemical properties of PrPSc, including detergent insolubility, protease resistance, slow metabolic generation and turnover, abnormally tight membrane attachment, and strain-like variations in glycosylation pattern and protease-cleavage site. We have now used this model system to examine the kinetics with which mutant PrP molecules acquire PrPSc-like properties and to draw inferences from this about the nature of the intermediates in the conversion process and the identity of the cellular compartments in which they are generated.

Confluent cultures of CHO cells were labeled in methionine-free minimal essential medium containing [35S]methionine (Pro-mix, 250-500 μCi/ml) and were chased in Opti-MEM (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cells were then lysed in a buffer that contained 150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.5% Triton X-100, and 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, supplemented with protease inhibitors (pepstatin and leupeptin, 1 μg/ml; phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mM; EDTA, 2 mM). Lysates were first centrifuged for 5 min at 16,000 × g in a microcentrifuge, a procedure that removes debris but does not pellet significant amounts of PrP. The cleared lysates were then centrifuged at 265,000 × g for 40 min in the TLA 100.3 rotor of a Beckman Optima TL ultracentrifuge to separate detergent-soluble and detergent-insoluble protein. Immunoprecipitation of moPrP in pellet and supernatant fractions from the second centrifugation was performed using monoclonal antibody 3F4 antibody as described previously (26Lehmann S. Harris D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24589-24597Google Scholar). In some experiments lysates were treated with N-glycosidase F (0.01 units/ml) for 16 h at 37°C prior to immunoprecipitation to produce a single band of deglycosylated PrP that could be more easily quantitated (32Harris D.A. Huber M.T. van Dijken P. Shyng S.-L. Chait B.T. Wang R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1009-1016Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitated proteins were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE), and radioactive gels were quantitated using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). Cells were metabolically labeled and chased as above. Proteins were methanol-precipitated from cell lysates, digested with proteinase K (3.3 μg/ml for 10 min at 37°C) in Sarkosyl, methanol-precipitated a second time, and then dispersed in detergent-lipid-protein complexes for immunoprecipitation of moPrP using anti-ME7 antibody, all as described (19Borchelt D.R. Taraboulos A. Prusiner S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16188-16199Google Scholar, 27Lehmann S. Harris D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1633-1637Google Scholar, 28Lehmann S. Harris D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5610-5614Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitated proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. For the experiment shown in Fig. 1C, lysates of unlabeled cells were centrifuged to assay detergent insolubility, after which proteins were methanol-precipitated from the pellet and supernatant fractions and subjected to proteinase K digestion as described above. Following digestion, proteins were concentrated by methanol precipitation and analyzed for moPrP by immunoblotting using 3F4 antibody. Metabolically labeled cells were solubilized for 20 min at 4°C in 1% Triton X-114 in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing protease inhibitors; the detergent was diluted from a 12% stock solution that had been precondensed according to Bordier (33Bordier C. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 1604-1607Google Scholar). After incubation at 37°C for 10 min, aqueous and detergent phases were separated by centrifugation. The detergent phase was diluted to the initial volume with PBS, incubated with or without PIPLC for 2 h at 4°C, and the phase separation repeated. PrP in each phase was immunoprecipitated with antibody 3F4 and separated on SDS-PAGE. Metabolically labeled cells were lysed and subjected to an initial phase partitioning in Triton X-114 as described above, except that the final detergent concentration was 0.5%. The detergent phase was diluted to the original volume with PBS, incubated with or without PIPLC for 2 h at 4°C, and then phenyl-Sepharose CL-4B (40 μl of beads, equilibrated in PBS plus 0.5% Triton X-114, per ml of sample) was added for 30 min at 4°C. The phenyl-Sepharose beads were then collected by centrifugation and bound protein released by boiling in Triton X-100/deoxycholate lysis buffer containing 0.5% SDS. MoPrP in the bound and unbound fractions was analyzed by immunoprecipitation with 3F4 antibody. For the experiments shown in Fig. 1, A-B, cells were biotinylated with sulfo-biotin-X-NHS as described by Shyng et al. (30Shyng S.-L. Moulder K.L. Lesko A. Harris D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14793-14800Google Scholar) and were then incubated with PIPLC (1 unit/ml in Opti-MEM) at 4°C for 2 h. MoPrP in incubation media and cell lysates was then assayed for detergent insolubility or phase partitioning in Triton X-114, as described above. Immunoprecipitates collected using antibody P45-66 were separated by SDS-PAGE, and biotinylated moPrP was visualized by developing blots of the gels with horseradish peroxidase-streptavidin and enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL). Lysates of metabolically labeled cells were cleared by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 2 min and were then loaded on a 10-ml linear gradient of 15-40% sucrose in lysis buffer. After centrifugation at 4°C for 16 h at 274,000 × g, 1-ml fractions of the gradient as well as the entire pellet were collected, and moPrP was immunoprecipitated with 3F4 antibody. We have previously shown that moPrP molecules carrying disease-related mutations display several biochemical properties characteristic of PrPSc when expressed in CHO cells (26Lehmann S. Harris D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24589-24597Google Scholar, 27Lehmann S. Harris D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1633-1637Google Scholar, 28Lehmann S. Harris D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5610-5614Google Scholar). These properties include (a) detergent insolubility, (b) protease resistance, (c) aberrant membrane attachment, as manifested by retention of the mutant protein on the cell surface after treatment with the enzyme phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PIPLC), and (d) hydrophobicity, as revealed by partial retention of the PIPLC-treated protein in the detergent phase of Triton X-114 lysates. Our objective was to use pulse-chase metabolic labeling to analyze the kinetics with which each of these properties was acquired following synthesis of the protein. In this way, we hoped to define a sequence of steps in the transformation of mutant PrPs to a PrPSc-like state. An important assumption underlying this strategy is that the same population of molecules eventually acquires all four properties. To test this assumption, we assayed the properties in pair-wise fashion using biotinylation or Western blotting to visualize the steady-state population of PrP molecules. For these experiments we utilized CHO cell lines expressing two different moPrP mutants whose human homologues are associated with familial CJD (4Parchi P. Gambetti P. Curr. Opin. Neurol. 1995; 8: 286-293Google Scholar): PG11, which contains six additional copies of the N-terminal octapeptide repeat which is found in five copies in the wild-type protein, and E199K which contains a single amino acid substitution. E199K moPrP was particularly useful for experiments involving PIPLC treatment, since ∼50% of this protein is releasable by the phospholipase (compared with <10% for the other mutants), allowing us to analyze both released and non-released fractions (27Lehmann S. Harris D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1633-1637Google Scholar). We have previously shown that the pool of E199K moPrP that is retained on the cell surface after PIPLC treatment is protease-resistant, whereas the released pool is protease-sensitive (27Lehmann S. Harris D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1633-1637Google Scholar). To test the correlation between PIPLC releasability and detergent insolubility, we treated surface-biotinylated cells with the phospholipase and then subjected the released and cell-associated fractions to centrifugation at 265,000 × g. We found that the PIPLC-released fraction was found in the supernatant after centrifugation, whereas the retained fraction was primarily in the pellet (Fig. 1A, lanes 5 and 8). To correlate PIPLC releasability and hydrophobicity, we subjected the released and cell-associated fractions of E199K moPrP to Triton X-114 phase partitioning. We found that the released pool partitioned into the aqueous phase, and the cell-associated pool was found in the detergent phase (Fig. 1B, lanes 5 and 8). In contrast to E199K moPrP, wild-type moPrP was completely PIPLC releasable, detergent-soluble, and hydrophilic in Triton X-114 (Fig. 1, A-B, lanes 1-4). We used PG11 moPrP to test the correlation between detergent insolubility and protease resistance. This mutant protein partitions about equally into pellet and supernatant fractions after centrifugation at 265,000 × g, but it is only the pellet fraction that yields a Mr 27-30 fragment after proteinase K treatment (Fig. 1C, lanes 7 and 8). As expected, wild-type moPrP was found entirely in the supernatant and was protease-sensitive (Fig. 1C, lanes 1-4). We conclude from these experiments that mutant PrP molecules that are protease-resistant, detergent-insoluble, and hydrophobic are also PIPLC non-releasable. In addition, molecules that are protease-resistant are also detergent-insoluble. Although we have not assayed all four properties simultaneously in the same experiment, our pairwise correlations indicate that at steady-state the same population of mutant moPrP molecules possesses the four biochemical properties of PrPSc. The centrifugation conditions we have used to assay detergent insolubility would pellet PrP aggregates having a sedimentation coefficient >40 S. To more accurately characterize the size distribution of mutant PrP, we pulse-labeled cells expressing PG11 moPrP and then fractionated detergent lysates by velocity sedimentation on 15-40% sucrose gradients. Consistent with earlier results showing that acquisition of detergent insolubility is primarily a posttranslational process (28Lehmann S. Harris D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5610-5614Google Scholar), PG11 moPrP sedimented as a single peak at ∼4 S (corresponding to the size of monomeric protein) immediately following pulse labeling for 20 min (Fig. 2, C-D). After a 2-h chase, the majority of the protein was found in two peaks at 4 S and >16.6 S but a substantial amount was also broadly distributed throughout the gradient (fractions 5-10). Wild-type moPrP sedimented near 4 S at both time points (Fig. 2, A-B). The broad size distribution of the PG11 protein at the 2-h chase point indicates that intermediate stages of aggregation of mutant PrP exist and suggests that acquisition of detergent insolubility may be a gradual process in which PrP aggregates grow in size over time. Based on a comparison with molecular size standards, the smallest aggregates consist of only a few molecules of PrP, whereas the largest contain over 10. In a previous study we showed that following pulse labeling PG11 moPrP becomes maximally detergent-insoluble at 1 h and maximally protease-resistant at 6 h (28Lehmann S. Harris D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5610-5614Google Scholar). This result suggests that acquisition of detergent insolubility may precede acquisition of protease resistance and raises the possibility that a detergent-insoluble but protease-sensitive form of PrP might be detectable at early times after pulse labeling. To test this possibility, we labeled cells expressing PG11 moPrP for 30 min, chased them for either 0 or 3 h, and then tested the protease resistance of pellet and supernatant fractions derived from a 265,000 × g centrifugation (Fig. 3). Immediately after labeling, 33% of the mutant PrP pelleted (lanes 1 and 3), and this amount increased to 65% after a 3-h chase (lanes 5 and 7). Of note, the insoluble PrP present immediately after labeling was protease-sensitive, with <1% of the pelleted protein remaining after proteinase K digestion (lane 4). In contrast, 15% of the insoluble protein was protease-resistant following a 3-h chase (lane 8). We conclude from this result that following synthesis mutant PrP is initially converted into a form that is detergent-insoluble and protease-sensitive and only later acquires protease resistance. To define the cellular compartments in which mutant PrPs become detergent-insoluble and protease-resistant, we utilized two treatments that inhibit the trafficking of proteins along the secretory pathway. First, we incubated cells expressing PG11 moPrP with the fungal metabolite brefeldin A (BFA) which causes fusion of the ER with the cis/medial-Golgi and thereby inhibits movement of proteins out of these compartments (34Lippincott-Schwartz J. Yuan L.C. Bonifacino J.S. Klausner R.D. Cell. 1989; 56: 801-813Google Scholar). Second, we incubated cells at 18°C, a treatment that blocks movement of proteins from the trans-Golgi network to the cell surface (35Matlin K.S. Simons K. Cell. 1983; 34: 233-243Google Scholar, 36Kuismanen E. Saraste J. Methods Cell Biol. 1989; 32: 257-274Google Scholar). We found that both of these manipulations caused a marked inhibition of the acquisition of both detergent insolubility (Fig. 4) and protease resistance (Fig. 5). The efficacy of BFA and 18°C incubation in blocking movement of protein along the biosynthetic pathway was confirmed by the fact that these treatments inhibited maturation of PrP oligosaccharide chains (note the lower molecular weight of the two glycosylated PrP species in Figs. 5, B-C, compared with Fig. 5A, lanes 1, 3, and 5); in addition, these treatments prevented delivery of wild-type moPrP to the cell surface as assayed by PIPLC accessibility (data not shown). We conclude from our results that transformation of PG11 moPrP to a detergent-insoluble and protease-resistant form occurs primarily in a post-Golgi compartment.Fig. 5BFA and 18°C incubation inhibit formation of the protease-resistant form of PG11 moPrP. CHO cells expressing PG11 moPrP were labeled with [35S]methionine for 1 h and then chased for 0, 2, or 4 h. Cells were incubated during the pulse and chase periods at either 37°C (A) or 18°C (B) in the absence of any drug or at 37°C in the presence of 1 μg/ml BFA (C). Proteins in cell lysates were then either untreated (− lanes) or were digested with proteinase K (PK) (+ lanes), and moPrP was analyzed by immunoprecipitation and SDS-PAGE. Five times as many cell equivalents were loaded in the + lanes as in the − lanes. Brackets beside lane 6 indicate the position of the protease-resistant fragment (27-30 kDa in A and 23-27 kDa in C). D, the amount of protease-resistant fragment from three experiments was quantitated using a PhosphorImager and plotted as a percentage of the amount PrP present in the absence of protease digestion. Each bar represents the mean ± S.D.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We observed that in the presence of BFA a small amount of protease-resistant PrP was detectable after 4 h of chase (Fig. 5, C-D). This result was not likely to be a consequence of escape from the BFA block, since the protease-resistant protein was underg"

PdG was site-specifically incorporated at position 6256 of M13MB102 DNA, and the adducted viral genome was electroporated into repair-proficient and repair-deficient Escherichia coli strains. Comparable frequencies of PdG → T and PdG → A mutations at position 6256 were detected following replication of the adducted genomes in wild-type E. coli strains. A 4-fold increase in the frequencies of transversions and transitions was observed in E. coli strains deficient in Uvr(A)BC-dependent nucleotide excision repair. A similar increase in the replication of the adduct containing strand was observed in the repair-deficient strains. No change in the frequency of targeted mutations was observed in strains deficient in one or both of the genes coding for 3-methyladenine glycosylase. Incubation of purified E. coli Uvr(A)BC proteins with a duplex 156-mer containing a single PdG adduct resulted in removal of a 12-base oligonucleotide containing the adduct. Incubation of the same adducted duplex with Chinese hamster ovary cell-free extracts also resulted in removal of the adduct. PdG was a better substrate for repair by the mammalian nucleotide excision repair complex than the bacterial repair complex and was approximately equal to a thymine-thymine dimer as a substrate for the former. The results of these in vivo and in vitro experiments indicate that PdG, a homolog of several endogenously produced DNA adducts, is repaired by the nucleotide excision repair pathway.

Exocyclic adducts that block the Watson-Crick base pairing region of DNA bases are produced from a range of exogenous and endogenous chemicals (1Singer B. Bartsch H. The Role of Cyclic Nucleic Acid Adducts in Carcinogenesis and Mutagenesis. International Agency for Research on Cancer, Lyon, France1986Google Scholar). Numerous exocyclic adducts have been identified including etheno and substituted ethano adducts to deoxyadenosine, deoxyguanosine, and deoxycytidine, propeno and substituted propano adducts to deoxyguanosine, and complex bicyclic adducts to deoxyguanosine (1Singer B.

Propanodeoxyguanosine (PdG), which is a model for the chemically unstable M1G and hydroxy-PdG adducts, is not a substrate for these glycosylases (18Singer B. Hang B. Chenna A. Proc. Am. Assoc. Cancer Res. 1996; 37 (abstr.): 645-646Google Scholar). We have undertaken an investigation of the repair of the prototypical exocyclic deoxyguanosine adduct, PdG, in vivo and in vitro. PdG was used as a model for the M1G and hydroxy-PdG adducts because of its stability during oligonucleotide synthesis and during the construction of large duplex oligonucleotides, which are necessary for in vitro repair assays. The removal of PdG was assessed in vivo by determining the mutation frequency and strand bias observed upon replication of M13 genomes containing this adduct in wild-type and repair-deficient strains of Escherichia coli. An increase in mutation frequency and adducted template replication in a repair-deficient strain was taken as an indication of the involvement of the deleted gene in repair. These experiments indicated that PdG residues are repaired by nucleotide excision repair. The in vivo results were confirmed by using an in vitro assay for the excision of the PdG adduct by both the E. coli and hamster excinucleases. Thus, PdG, a surrogate for endogenous adducts present in healthy humans, is a substrate for both bacterial and mammalian nucleotide excision repair proteins.

As controls, unmodified (140-mer) or psoralen monoadducted DNA (45-mer) were prepared in a similar manner. UvrA, UvrB, and UvrC were purified as described (23Thomas D.C. Levy M. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 9875-9883Google Scholar) and kindly provided by Dr. M.-S. Tang. The reaction mixtures contained 1.5 fmol of radiolabeled DNA, 15 nM UvrA, 15 nM UvrB, 15 nM UvrC, and 100 ng of ϕX174 DNA in 25 μl of buffer that was 50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mM KCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM dithiothreitol, and 1 mM ATP. Incubation was at 37°C with the reaction being stopped by the addition of 2 μl of a 1:1 mixture of 0.25 M EDTA and 5 mg/ml oyster glycogen, followed by ethanol precipitation. Recovered DNA was resuspended in formamide/dye mixture and resolved on an 8% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. Following autoradiography to visualize the repair products, the level of excision was quantitated by PhosphorImager analysis. For unmodified DNA, 5-μl aliquots were withdrawn from the 25-μl reaction mixture such that each time point was represented by ∼0.3 fmol of DNA. A repair-proficient (wild-type) Chinese hamster ovary cell line, K1, was used to assay excision in a mammalian system. Cells were grown to exponential phase as a suspension culture in Eagle's minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were harvested and cell-free extract (CFE) was prepared as described (24Manley J.L. Fire A. Cano A. Sharp P.A. Gefter M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 3855-3859Google Scholar) and stored at −80°C in buffer that was 25 mM Hepes, pH 7.9, 100 mM KCl, 12 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM EDTA, 2 mM dithiothreitol, and 12.5% glycerol (v/v). The CFE concentration was 12.1 mg/ml, and the extract was stable for at least two cycles of thawing and refreezing. Using an internally labeled DNA substrate (at the fifth phosphodiester bond 5′ to the PdG residue or at the eleventh bond 5′ to T<>T), this assay detects the excised fragment resulting from both 5′ and 3′ incisions. The reaction mixtures contained 25 fmol of radiolabeled DNA, 121 μg of CFE, and 70 ng of pBR322 in 50 μl of buffer that was 35 mM Hepes, pH 7.9, 10 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 60 mM KCl, 40 mM NaCl, 5.6 mM MgCl2, 0.4 mM EDTA, 0.8 mM dithiothreitol, 2 mM ATP, and 3.2% glycerol with 20 μM each of dATP, dCTP, dGTP, and TTP, and bovine serum albumin at 0.2 mg/ml. The reaction was carried out at 30°C for 90 min with 10 μl of the mixture (∼5 fmol DNA) being removed at 15, 30, 60, and 90 min. DNA was deproteinized with proteinase K (0.2 mg/ml for 15 min at 37°C) followed by phenol, phenol:chloroform, and ether extractions then precipitated with ethanol in the presence of 20 μg of oyster glycogen. Recovered DNA was resuspended in formamide/dye mixture and resolved on a 10% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. Following autoradiography to visualize the repair products, the level of excision (oligomers in the 23-30-nt range) was quantitated by scanning the dried gel with an AMBIS systems scanner. Recombinant M13 genomes containing a site-specifically positioned PdG adduct were constructed by ligation of the PdG 8-mer (5′-GGT(PdG)TCCG-3′) into a gapped duplex DNA molecule containing uracil in the (+)-strand and an 8-base gap in the (−)-strand (7Burcham P.C. Marnett L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28844-28850Google Scholar). Control genomes were constructed by ligation of the unmodified 8-mer. The oligonucleotides used for genome construction were purified by reversed phase HPLC and were judged greater than 99.3% pure by HPLC and denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of 32P-labeled material. The structures of the oligonucleotides were verified by high field NMR analysis and by HPLC analysis of the deoxynucleosides released by nuclease digestion. The fully ligated genomes were isolated from the remaining starting material and incompletely ligated duplexes by agarose gel electrophoresis in the presence of 0.5 μg/ml ethidium bromide (6Benamira M. Singh U.S. Marnett L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22392-22400Google Scholar). Purified, fully ligated recombinant M13MB102 DNA was electroporated into the SOS-induced competent E. coli strains. Following overnight growth and elution of the entire plaque population from primary transformations, the eluate was diluted and replated on X-gal/isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactoside indicator plates to give approximately 1,500 plaques/plate (6Benamira M. Singh U.S. Marnett L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22392-22400Google Scholar). These secondary plates were used in the hybridization assay (7Burcham P.C. Marnett L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28844-28850Google Scholar). Elution of the primary plates enabled us to standardize the number of plaques/plate for the hybridization assay, as well as allowed screening of a large number of the transformants that were produced during electroporation. The mutation frequency was not significantly different when the DNA was screened for mutations after either the primary or secondary plating (data not shown). The base pair substitution mutation frequency was determined by screening for transitions and transversions at position 6256 by differential hybridization with 13-mer probes (7Burcham P.C. Marnett L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28844-28850Google Scholar). Recombinant single-stranded M13MB102 DNAs containing each of the four possible bases at the adduct site were hybridized in parallel as assay standards (7Burcham P.C. Marnett L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28844-28850Google Scholar). Table I lists the mutation frequencies determined following electroporation of PdG-containing M13 genomes into strains deficient in nucleotide excision repair or one or both of the 3-methyladenine glycosylase genes. The base pair substitution mutation frequencies induced by the PdG adduct in M13MB102 replicated in LM102 and LM101 were similar to the mutation frequency previously reported in JM105 (7Burcham P.C. Marnett L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28844-28850Google Scholar). LM102 and LM101 are wild-type for DNA repair. When PdG-adducted M13MB102 was transformed into LM103, there was approximately a 4-fold increase in both PdG → A transitions as well as the PdG → C and PdG → T transversions at position 6256 (Table I). The total mutation frequency induced in this strain was 11.6% as compared with the overall mutation frequency of 3.1% in the wild-type strain LM102. In contrast, no differences in mutation frequencies were detected when PdG-containing genomes were electroporated into strains deficient in one or both of the two genes that code for 3-methyladenine glycosylase activity (LM108, LM109, and LM110).Table IPercentages of base pair substitutions induced by PdG in repair-deficient strainsStrainG → AG → CG → TLM102 (wild type)1.5 ± 0.40.1 ± 0.11.5 ± 0.3LM103 (uvrA−)5.0 ± 1.00.5 ± 0.36.0 ± 0.4LM101 (wild type)1.7 ± 0.60.07 ± 0.051.7 ± 0.4LM108 (alkA−)1.5 ± 0.60.15 ± 0.051.8 ± 0.4LM109 (tagA−)1.8 ± 0.80.04 ± 0.011.9 ± 0.9LM110 (alkA−tagA−)1.6 ± 0.70.15 ± 0.011.3 ± 0.3 Open table in a new tab In these initial in vivo experiments, uracil residues were randomly incorporated into the (+)-strand of the recombinant M13 genomes to minimize replication of the nonadducted strand. However, we have recently found that a significant amount of replication of the adducted genomes occurs in which the (+)-strand is used as the template (20Fink S.P. Reddy G.R. Marnett L.J. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1996; 9: 277-283Google Scholar). This accounts for the high percentage of progeny phage that contain G at position 6256 because the (+)-strand contained a C residue at this position. It is possible to estimate the percentages of replication that occur from the (−)- and (+)-strands by placing T residues opposite the adduct in the recombinant genomes. Utilization of the (+)-strand as template leads to the incorporation of A residues at position 6256, whereas utilization of the (−)-strand as template leads to incorporation of whatever bases are inserted opposite PdG. For the experiments described below, recombinant M13 genomes were constructed that did not contain uracil residues in the (+)-strand. This reduces the apparent mutation frequency at position 6256 by approximately 50% (20Fink S.P. Reddy G.R. Marnett L.J. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1996; 9: 277-283Google Scholar). M13MB102 genomes that contained G:T or PdG:T at position 6256 were electroporated into a wild-type strain (JM105), a recA− strain (LM104), and two nucleotide excision repair-deficient strains (LM103 and NR10148), and the identities of the bases incorporated were probed by hybridization analysis (Table II). For nonadducted genomes, the (−)-strand was used as template approximately 90% of the time, and no G → T transversions were detected within the limit of sensitivity of the assay (∼0.1%). When PdG was present in the (−)-strand, most of the replication occurred from the nonadducted (+)-strand. The total amount of replication from the (−)-strand was estimated by summing the frequencies of incorporation of G, T, and C and assuming that A was incorporated at the same frequency as T. The assumption of equal frequencies of PdG → A and PdG → T mutations was based on the results obtained with M13MB102 containing PdG:C at position 6256 (Table I). The remainder of the incorporation of A during replication of M13MB102 containing PdG:T at position 6256 was from utilization of the (+)-strand as template, and this clearly represented the majority of the replication events.Table II.Replication of M13MB102 genomes containing G:T or PdG:T on the (−)-strand at position 6256 in repair-deficient E. coli strainsstrain(+)-strandaThe values for the replication of the (+)-strand contain a small contribution from mutagenic replication (PdG → A) of the (−)-strand.

Open table in a new tab The PdG-containing (−)-strand was used as template approximately 6% of the time in JM105 and 4% of the time in LM104. The concordance of these results indicates that the shift in template utilization induced by PdG was not the result of recA-mediated strand switching. Rather, it arose from complete replication of the (+)-strand or synthesis using the (+)-strand as template following repair of PdG. The significant reduction in mutation frequency observed in LM104 supports prior findings that mutagenesis by PdG is enhanced by induction of the SOS response (7Burcham P.C. Marnett L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28844-28850Google Scholar,20Fink S.P. Reddy G.R. Marnett L.J. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1996; 9: 277-283Google Scholar). The contribution of nucleotide excision repair to replication of the (+)-strand was estimated by comparing JM105 with LM103 and NR10148. The PdG-adducted strand was used as template 21% of the time in the uvrA− strain LM103. The relative frequency of (−)-strand utilization in JM105 and LM103 (3.5-fold) was comparable with the ratio of mutation frequencies measured with LM102 and LM103 (3.7-fold) (Table I). Because JM105 is a wild-type strain with regard to nucleotide excision repair, whereas LM103 is uvrA−, these results are consistent with a role for nucleotide excision repair in removing PdG residues. Removal of PdG in JM105 and LM102 by nucleotide excision repair would lead to increased incorporation of A residues during repair synthesis because of the presence of T at position 6256 on the (+)-strand. Although the frequency of replication of PdG was higher in the uvrA− cells, the mutation frequency was similar to that observed in wild-type cells when corrected for template utilization. 26% of the (−)-strand replication events led to mutations in JM105, and 38% led to mutations in LM103. Electroporation of PdG-containing M13MB102 into NR10148, which is uvrB−, produced frequencies of template utilization (18%) and mutations (39%) comparable with those observed in LM103. Thus, mutations in two different genes of nucleotide excision repair led to similar effects on replication of PdG-containing M13 genomes in vivo. 2Comparable results also were obtained in a second uvrA− strain that carries a Tn10 insertion in the uvrA gene. (S. P. Fink, unpublished results). Results from the in vivo mutagenesis studies suggested that the Uvr(A)BC excinuclease is involved in the repair of the PdG adduct in E. coli because the absence of the uvrA or uvrB genes increased the frequency of mutations induced by PdG. Repair of the PdG adduct by Uvr(A)BC excinuclease was further investigated by use of an in vitro assay in which duplex DNA containing the PdG adduct was incubated with purified Uvr(A)BC repair enzymes to determine if excision occurred. The substrate for these in vitro experiments was a 156-mer duplex DNA bearing PdG near the center of the duplex. It was constructed by ligating a 5′-labeled 12-mer containing the PdG adduct at position 4, with seven other oligomers to obtain a 156-mer duplex (21Huang J.-C. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19034-19040Google Scholar). The 12-mers were purified by HPLC as described above for the 8-mers used for recombinant genome construction. The fully ligated DNA was purified from the partially ligated product by running the ligation mixture on a polyacrylamide gel and excising the band corresponding to the 156-mer. The Uvr(A)BC excinuclease repairs damaged DNA by excision of a 12-nucleotide fragment of DNA by hydrolysis of the eighth phosphodiester bond 5′ and the fourth phosphodiester bond 3′ to the adducted nucleotide (25Myles G.M. Sancar A. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1989; 2: 197-226Google Scholar,26Grossman L. Thiagalingam S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16871-16874Google Scholar). By phosphorylating the oligonucleotide containing the adduct with 32P prior to ligation, we were able to determine the extent of excision by the appearance of a 12-nucleotide band on an autoradiogram of a polyacrylamide gel following incubation with the repair enzymes. A 12-nucleotide fragment of DNA was excised when the 156-mer substrate adducted with PdG was incubated with the Uvr(A)BC excinuclease. The extent of excision increased linearly up to 40 min, at which point it plateaued (Fig. 2). In addition to the 12-mer product, a band corresponding to a 74-mer was detected, which represents uncoupled excision at only the 3′ end of the duplex. There was no excision in the samples incubated with boiled enzyme or the samples terminated immediately after addition of the enzyme. DNA that did not contain an adduct was also not excised by these enzymes (27Huang J.-C. Hsu D.S. Kazantsev A. Sancar A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12213-12217Google Scholar). Approximately 1% of the PdG-containing 156-mer substrate was cut by the excinuclease. A 45-mer substrate containing a psoralen mono adduct was used as a positive control for these experiments, because psoralen is excised very efficiently by the Uvr(A)BC excinuclease (27Huang J.-C. Hsu D.S. Kazantsev A. Sancar A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12213-12217Google Scholar). Approximately 50% of the psoralen-adducted DNA was cut. Thus, by comparison with psoralen, PdG appears to be a relatively poor substrate for the E. coli Uvr(A)BC excinuclease. The ability of a mammalian nucleotide excinuclease to excise the PdG adduct was also determined. The mammalian excinuclease hydrolyzes the fifth phosphodiester bond 3′ and twenty-second to twenty-fourth phosphodiester bond 5′ to the lesion, releasing a 27-29-nucleotide fragment containing the adduct (28Huang J.-C. Svoboda D.L. Reardon J.T. Sancar A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3664-3668Google Scholar). When the PdG-modified 156-mer was incubated with a Chinese hamster ovary CFE, 23-28-mer fragments were released (Fig. 3 lane 2-4) that shortened with time due to nuclease action. Parallel experiments were conducted with a 140-mer containing a thymine-thymine cyclobutane dimer (Fig. 3 lanes 3-8). The extent of cleavage of the cyclobutane dimer-containing duplex was approximately the same as the PdG-containing duplex. Thus, PdG appears to be a much better substrate for the mammalian excinuclease than for the bacterial excinuclease. Three separate lines of evidence suggest that PdG is a substrate for nucleotide excision repair. First, the frequency of targeted base pair substitution mutations induced by PdG is higher in nucleotide excision repair-deficient strains than in wild-type strains in vivo. Second, the extent of PdG-containing template utilization is higher in nucleotide excision repair-deficient strains than in wild-type strains in vivo. Third, oligonucleotides of the expected size are removed from a PdG-containing 156-mer following incubation with reconstituted E. coli or hamster excinuclease complexes in vitro. The studies of template utilization summarized in Table II are particularly informative in that they reveal a dramatic switch in template utilization when PdG is incorporated into M13 genomes. The low percentage of (−)-strand replication indicates that PdG is either a strong block to replication or is very efficiently repaired. Moriya et al. have shown that PdG is an effective block to replication when incorporated into single-stranded vectors (8Moriya M. Zhang W. Johnson F. Grollman A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11899-11903Google Scholar). Incorporation of adducts that are strong blocks to replication into the (−)-strand of M13MB102 could lead to an apparent shift in template utilization because of the consecutive rather than bidirectional mechanism of strand replication employed by M13 genomes (29Baas P.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 825: 111-139Google Scholar). Once the lesion is bypassed during the initial stage of DNA replication, the (+)-strand released can be rapidly copied to a duplex. The (−)-strand of this newly synthesized duplex will dominate viral DNA synthesis because the duplex produced in the initial phase of genome replication still contains the adduct in the (−)-strand. The data in Table II indicate that a portion of the utilization of the (+)-strand as template occurs during DNA synthesis subsequent to nucleotide excision repair because replication of the adducted (−)-strand increases in cells that are deficient in either the uvrA or uvrB genes. This shift in template utilization masks the mutagenic potency displayed by PdG in duplex vectors. For example, the percentage of mutations induced by PdG in M13MB102 increases from approximately 1.5 to 28% when correction is made for the strand that is actually used as the template. The magnitude of the increase in the use of the adduct-containing strand as template is approximately the same as the magnitude of the increase in the mutation frequency. However, even in nucleotide excision repair-deficient cells, the nonadducted strand is still the preferred template for M13MB102 replication. This is likely due to replication blockade by the PdG residue on the (−)-strand, but we cannot rule out the possibility that another repair pathway such as base excision repair contributes to the utilization of the (+)-strand as template. Interestingly, deletion of the 3-methyladenine glycosylase gene (alkA), which has been reported to participate in the repair of etheno adducts to deoxyguanosine and deoxyadenosine residues (12Singer B. Antoccia A. Basu A.K. Dosanjh M.K. Fraenkel-Conrat H. Gallagher P.E. Kusmierek J.T. Qiu Z.-H. Rydberg B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9386-9390Google Scholar–15Saparbaev M. Kleibl K. Laval J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 3750-3755Google Scholar), does not increase the mutation frequency measured following in vivo replication of PdG-adducted M13MB102. Repair of PdG was further studied in an in vitro excision assay in which a 156-base pair substrate containing PdG was incubated with either the purified E. coli enzymes or a mammalian CFE. Removal of the adduct was detected by the appearance of the excised oligonucleotide fragments when reaction mixtures were analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The E. coli enzymes excised approximately 1% of the adducted substrate. This low level of in vitro excision is similar to the amounts detected with other small adducts such as O6-methylguanine and DNA mismatches (27Huang J.-C. Hsu D.S. Kazantsev A. Sancar A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12213-12217Google Scholar). This is considerably less than the extent of excision of larger adducts such as psoralen- or aflatoxin-derived adducts or thymine dimers (27Huang J.-C. Hsu D.S. Kazantsev A. Sancar A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12213-12217Google Scholar,30Svoboda D.L. Smith C.A. Taylor J.-S.A. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10694-10700Google Scholar,31Oleykowski C.A. Mayernik J.A. Lim S.E. Groopman J.D. Grossman L. Wogan G.N. Yeung A.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7990-8002Google Scholar). However, in contrast to excision by the E. coli excinuclease, PdG is a good substrate for removal by a mammalian excinuclease complex. The extent of excision of PdG-containing oligonucleotides by a hamster CFE is approximately the same as the extent of excision of thymine dimer-containing oligonucleotides, which are classic substrates for mammalian nucleotide excision repair. The present findings establish that PdG is repaired by bacterial and mammalian nucleotide excision repair complexes. Although PdG is a relatively poor substrate for the bacterial excinuclease in vitro, the higher frequency of PdG-induced mutations in excision repair-deficient strains of E. coli indicates that repair by Uvr(A)BC is important in vivo. PdG appears to be a good substrate for repair by the mammalian excinuclease. This is interesting because several exocyclic deoxyguanosine adducts, including some hydroxy-PdGs, have been detected in DNA from healthy human beings (3Chaudhary A.K. Nokubo M. Reddy G.R. Yeola S.N. Morrow J.D. Blair I.A. Marnett L.J. Science. 1994; 265: 1580-1582Google Scholar,4Nath R.G. Chung F.-L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7491-7495Google Scholar,32O'Nair J. Barbin A. Guichard Y. Bartsch H. Carcinogenesis. 1995; 16: 613-617Google Scholar). The levels of adducts detected in DNA reflect the steady-state balance between adduct generation and adduct removal, so if these exocyclic adducts are removed as efficiently as PdG by nucleotide excision repair, their contribution to endogenous DNA damage is significantly higher than one would estimate by determination of absolute adduct levels. We are grateful to D. S. Hsu, D. Mu, J. T. Reardon, and A. Sancar for assistance in the execution of the in vitro repair assays and for helpful discussions."

https://openalex.org/W2036297883,"Newly synthesized apolipoprotein B (apoB) undergoes rapid degradation in a pre-Golgi compartment in HepG2 cells. A major site of this early degradation seems to be on the cytosolic side of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane and is sensitive to N-acetyl-leucinyl-leucinyl-norleucinal (ALLN), which can inhibit neutral cysteine proteases and/or proteasome activity. Oleate (OA) treatment, which facilitates translocation of nascent apoB across the ER membrane, also reduces early degradation. In the present studies, we have used brefeldin A (BFA), which inhibits vesicular transport from the ER to the Golgi, to demonstrate that apoB can also be degraded by an ER luminal proteolytic activity that is distinct from the ALLN-sensitive proteases. Thus, when BFA-treated HepG2 cells were co-treated with ALLN, which protects apoB but does not facilitate its translocation into the ER lumen, degradation of newly synthesized apoB was significantly reduced compared with cells incubated with BFA alone. However, apoB degradation was rapid and complete when OA was added to media containing either BFA or ALLN/BFA. These results suggested that OA, by increasing translocation of nascent apoB into the ER lumen, exposed apoB to an ALLN-resistant proteolytic pathway. When we incubated HepG2 cells with dithiothreitol (DTT)/OA/BFA or DTT/OA/ALLN/BFA, degradation of apoB was inhibited. Furthermore, addition of DTT resulted in the accumulation of a 70-kDa amino-terminal fragment of apoB. Both full-length and amino-terminal apoB were degraded if DTT was removed from the incubation media; both were secreted if only BFA was removed. Thus, even after apoB is translocated into the ER lumen (thereby avoiding the initial proteolytic pathway), it can potentially be degraded by a lumenal proteolytic process that is ALLN-resistant but DTT-sensitive. The present results, together with previous studies, suggest that at least two distinct steps may be involved in the posttranslational degradation of apoB: 1) the first occurs while apoB is partially translocated and is ALLN-sensitive; and 2) the second occurs in the ER lumen and is DTT-sensitive. Finally, our results support the hypothesis that degradation of partially translocated apoB generates a 70-kDa amino-terminal fragment that is mainly degraded in the ER lumen by a DTT-sensitive pathway. Newly synthesized apolipoprotein B (apoB) undergoes rapid degradation in a pre-Golgi compartment in HepG2 cells. A major site of this early degradation seems to be on the cytosolic side of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane and is sensitive to N-acetyl-leucinyl-leucinyl-norleucinal (ALLN), which can inhibit neutral cysteine proteases and/or proteasome activity. Oleate (OA) treatment, which facilitates translocation of nascent apoB across the ER membrane, also reduces early degradation.

From these two kinetic parameters, affinity was determined to be similar to that of the intact membrane-associated receptor expressed on COS cells. sBMPR inhibited the alkaline phosphatase activity in BMP responsive cell lines such as mouse osteoblastic cell MC3T3-E1 and bone marrow stromal cell ST2. These data indicate that the extracellular domain of type I receptor for BMP-2 and BMP-4 is sufficient for high-affinity binding to its ligands and should prove useful in understanding the role of BMP-2/4 in vivo, because a suitable high-affinity anti-BMP antibody has yet to be developed.

We report here that extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)-1 and −2 are constitutively activated in v-Ras- and PC-PLC-transformed cells in the absence of added growth factors. Interestingly, the activated ERKs were exclusively localized to the cell nucleus. Consistently, the transactivating potential of the C-terminal domain of Elk-1, which is activated upon ERK-mediated phosphorylation, was strongly induced in serum-starved cells expressing v-Ras or PC-PLC. Reversion of v-Ras- or PC-PLC-induced transformation by expression of dominant negative λPKC abolished the nuclear ERK activation suggesting λPKC as a novel, direct or indirect, activator of mitogen-activated protein kinase/ERK kinase in response to activated Ras or elevated levels of phosphatidylcholine-derived diacylglycerol. Transient transfection experiments confirmed that λPKC acts downstream of Ras but upstream of mitogen-activated protein kinase/ERK kinase. We found both the v-Ras- and PC-PLC-transformed cells to be insensitive to stimulation with platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF). No detectable receptor level, autophosphorylation, or superinduction of DNA synthesis could be observed in response to treatment with PDGF. Reversion of the transformed cell lines by expression of dominant negative λPKC restored the receptor level and the ability to respond to PDGF in terms of receptor autophosphorylation, ERK activation, and induction of DNA synthesis."

The concentrations and rates of clearance and production of extracellular glutamate were measured in the medium of primary cultures from mouse neocortex containing neurons, astrocytes, or both cell types. Measurements were performed in the presence and absence of 2 mM glutamine with or without neuronal injury caused by 5-h exposure to hypoxia or 500 μM N-methyl-D-aspartate or a freeze-thaw cycle. High rates of glutamate generation (0.5-0.8 μM/min in the 0.4-ml culture well) occurred if neurons were both damaged and exposed to glutamine. Intact neurons or glia exposed to glutamine generated only small amounts of glutamate (0.03 μM/min). Glutamate generation by damaged neurons was dependent on the presence of glutamine, activated by phosphate, and inhibited by 6-diazo-5-oxo-L-norleucine and p-chloromercuriphenylsulfonic acid (pCMPS), strongly implicating the mitochondrial glutaminase. Following 5-h exposure to 500 μM N-methyl-D-aspartate, the glutaminase was localized to fragments of damaged neurons and was accessible to inhibition by the membrane-impermeant pCMPS. The glutaminase activity from damaged neurons is sufficient to account for the neurotoxic concentrations of glutamate in hypoxic mixed neuronal-glial cultures exposed to 2 mM glutamine. Finally, pCMPS is neuroprotective and also prevents the increased rate of generation of glutamate observed in neuronal cultures after prolonged exposure to glutamine. The cumulative data indicate the following: 1) excitotoxic neuronal death activates the hydrolysis of extracellular glutamine by the mitochondrial glutaminase, and 2) the glutaminase in damaged neurons is sufficient to cause neuronal death in in vitro models of neuronal injury.

https://openalex.org/W2018096655,"Neutrophil elastase (NE) and cathepsin G are two serine proteinases released concomitantly by stimulated polymorphonuclear neutrophils. We previously demonstrated that while NE by itself does not activate human platelets, it strongly enhances the weak aggregation induced by a threshold concentration of cathepsin G (threshold of cathepsin G) (Renesto, P., and Chignard, M. (1993) Blood 82, 139-144). The aim of this study was to delineate the molecular mechanisms involved in this potentiation process. Two main pieces of data prompted us to focus on the activation of the platelet fibrinogen receptor, the αIIbβ3 integrin. First, previous studies have shown this integrin to be particularly prone to proteolytic regulation of its function. Second, we found that the potentiating activity of NE on the threshold of cathepsin G-induced platelet aggregation was strictly dependent on the presence of exogenous fibrinogen. Using flow cytometry analysis, NE was shown to trigger a time-dependent binding of PAC-1 and AP-5, two monoclonal antibodies specific for the activated and ligand-occupied conformers of αIIbβ3. Furthermore, the potentiated aggregation was shown to result from an increased capacity of platelets to bind fibrinogen. Indeed, the combination of NE and threshold of cathepsin G increased the binding of PAC-1 ≈5.5-fold over basal values measured on nontreated platelets, whereas this binding raised only by ≈3-fold in threshold of cathepsin G-stimulated platelets (p < 0.05). By contrast, phosphatidic acid accumulation, pleckstrin phosphorylation, and calcium mobilization produced by the combination of NE and threshold of cathepsin G were not significantly different from those measured with threshold of cathepsin G alone (p > 0.05), indicating that the phospholipase C/protein kinase C pathway is not involved in the potentiation of aggregation. The foregoing data, as well as the requirement of catalytically active NE to trigger αIIbβ3 activation and potentiate threshold of cathepsin G-initiated platelet aggregation, led us to examine whether the structure of this integrin was affected by NE. Immunoblot and flow cytometry analysis revealed a limited proteolysis of the carboxyl terminus of the αIIb subunit heavy chain (αIIbH), as judged by the disappearance of the epitope for the monoclonal antibody PMI-1. Mass spectrometry studies performed on a synthetic peptide mapping over the cleavage domain of αIIbH predicted the site of proteolysis as located between Val837 and Asp838. Treatment by NE of ATP-depleted platelets or Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing human recombinant αIIbβ3 clearly established that activation of the integrin was independent of signal transduction events and was concomitant with the proteolysis of αIIbH. In support of this latter observation, a close correlation was observed between the kinetics of proteolysis of αIIbH on platelets and that of expression of the ligand binding activity of αIIbβ3 (r2 = 0.902, p ≤ 0.005). However, only a subpopulation (≈25%) of the proteolyzed αIIbβ3 appeared to fully express the ligand binding capacity. Altogether, these results demonstrate that NE up-regulates the fibrinogen binding activity of αIIbβ3 through a restricted proteolysis of the αIIb subunit, and that this process is relevant for the potentiation of platelet aggregation."

In the present study, we used a constitutively active MAPK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) kinase 1 (MEK1) mutant to investigate the function of the highly conserved MEK1-ERK2 signaling module in renal epithelial cell differentiation and proliferation. Stable expression of constitutively active MEK1 (CA-MEK1) in epithelial MDCK-C7 cells led to an increased basal and serum-stimulated ERK1 and ERK2 phosphorylation as well as ERK2 activation when compared with mock-transfected cells. In both mock-transfected and CA-MEK1-transfected MDCK-C7 cells, basal and serum-stimulated ERK1 and ERK2 phosphorylation was almost abolished by the synthetic MEK inhibitor PD098059. Increased ERK2 activation due to stable expression of CA-MEK1 in MDCK-C7 cells was associated with epithelial dedifferentiation as shown by both a dramatic alteration in cell morphology and an abolished cytokeratin expression but increased vimentin expression. In addition, we obtained a delayed and reduced serum-stimulated cell proliferation in CA-MEK1-transfected cells (4.6-fold increase in cell number/cm2 after 5 days of serum stimulation) as compared with mock-transfected controls (12.9-fold increase in cell number/cm2 after 5 days). This result was confirmed by flow cytometric DNA analysis showing that stable expression of CA-MEK1 decreased the proportion of MDCK-C7 cells moving from G0/G1 to G2/M as compared with both untransfected and mock-transfected cells. Taken together, our data demonstrate an association of increased basal and serum-stimulated activity of the MEK1-ERK2 signaling module with epithelial dedifferentiation and growth inhibition in MDCK-C7 cells.

They have the unique feature of being activated by phosphorylation on threonine and tyrosine residues by an upstream dual-specificity kinase called MAPK kinase (MAPKK or MKK) or MAPK/ERK kinase (MEK) (reviewed in Refs. 1Cobb M.H.

However, although different MEK isoforms were previously shown to be differentially regulated, they appear to elicit similar transcriptional as well as morphological responses and to share ERK2 as a downstream effector (12Mansour S.J.

Constitutively active as well as dominant negative MEK mutants have been utilized by different laboratories to study the function of the highly conserved MEK-ERK module in cell proliferation and differentiation. Expression of constitutively active MEK mutants, generated by substitution of the Raf1-dependent regulatory phosphorylation sites serine 218 and serine 222 by aspartic acid or glutamic acid, has been reported to transform fibroblasts and to induce tumor formation in nude mice (18Brunet A. Pagès G. Pouysségur J. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3379-3387Google Scholar, 19Cowley S. Paterson H. Kemp P. Marshall C.J. Cell. 1994; 77: 841-852Google Scholar, 20Mansour S.J. Matten W.T. Hermann A.S.

Moreover, overexpression of a S222E mutant of MEK, which showed enhanced MEK activity as well as stimulation of ERK and p90rsk, increased proliferation and altered morphology of NIH 3T3 fibroblasts but failed to induce their growth in soft agar (21Seger R. Seger D. Reszka A.A. Munar E.S. Eldar-Finkelman H. Dobrowolska G. Jensen A.M. Campbell J.S. Fischer E.H. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25699-25709Google Scholar). In contrast to these experiments performed in fibroblasts, a constitutively active MEK1 mutant stimulated PC12 cell differentiation, while interfering mutants of MEK1 inhibited ligand-induced neurite outgrowth (19Cowley S. Paterson H. Kemp P. Marshall C.J. Cell. 1994; 77: 841-852Google Scholar). Thus, constitutive activation of the only known ERK activator MEK leads to transformation of fibroblasts but differentiation of PC12 cells, suggesting that cell type-specific differences in the function of the MEK-ERK signaling module might exist. Despite these results, comparable studies in renal epithelial cells are not available to date. We have recently reported a differential regulation of ERK1, ERK2, and c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase 1 (JNK1) activity in dedifferentiated MDCK-C7Focus (MDCK-C7F) cells as compared with their parental epithelial MDCK-C7 cells (22Schramek H. Schumacher M. Wilflingseder D. Oberleithner H. Pfaller W. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; (in press)Google Scholar). Cloned MDCK-C7 cells, when grown for 2 weeks in alkaline (pH 7.7) culture medium, dedifferentiate, exhibit a spindle-shaped morphology with long dendrite-like protrusions, and lack contact inhibition as well as monolayer formation (22Schramek H. Schumacher M. Wilflingseder D. Oberleithner H. Pfaller W. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; (in press)Google Scholar,23Wünsch S. Gekle M. Kersting U. Schuricht B. Oberleithner H. J. Cell. Physiol. 1995; 164: 164-171Google Scholar). When subsequently cultured in standard medium (pH 7.4) MDCK-C7F cells maintained their altered phenotype (22Schramek H. Schumacher M. Wilflingseder D. Oberleithner H. Pfaller W. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; (in press)Google Scholar,23Wünsch S. Gekle M. Kersting U. Schuricht B. Oberleithner H. J. Cell. Physiol. 1995; 164: 164-171Google Scholar). Utilizing this renal epithelial cell model, we obtained a substantially increased ERK2 activity in quiescent and serum-treated dedifferentiated MDCK-C7F cells as compared with their parental epithelial MDCK-C7 cells (22Schramek H. Schumacher M. Wilflingseder D. Oberleithner H. Pfaller W. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; (in press)Google Scholar). In contrast, JNK1 activity, which represents one member of the stress-activated protein kinase family of MAPKs, was slightly but consistently decreased in both quiescent and anisomycin-stimulated MDCK-C7F cells (22Schramek H. Schumacher M. Wilflingseder D. Oberleithner H. Pfaller W. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; (in press)Google Scholar). Furthermore, differential activation of ERK2 and JNK1 was accompanied by an inhibition of serum-induced MDCK-C7F cell proliferation (22Schramek H. Schumacher M. Wilflingseder D. Oberleithner H. Pfaller W. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; (in press)Google Scholar). Thus, transient exposure of epithelial MDCK-C7 cells to alkaline stress leads to cell dedifferentiation and growth inhibition associated with increased basal and serum-stimulated ERK2 activation but decreased JNK1 activity. Based on our findings in dedifferentiated MDCK-C7F cells as compared with their parental epithelial MDCK-C7 cells, we hypothesized a negative regulatory function of MEK1 in renal epithelial cell differentiation and proliferation. To verify this hypothesis we utilized a constitutively active MEK1 construct (18Brunet A. Pagès G. Pouysségur J. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3379-3387Google Scholar) and studied its effects on cell differentiation and proliferation in epithelial MDCK-C7 cells. Here we report that stable expression of a hemagglutinin epitope-tagged constitutively active MEK1 mutant (S218D/S222D mutant) in MDCK-C7 cells leads to epithelial dedifferentiation as well as to a reduction of cell proliferation. This report provides evidence for a MEK1-ERK2-induced epithelial to mesenchymal transition of MDCK-C7 cell differentiation, associated with an attenuation of cell proliferation.

Cells were grown at 37°C in 5% CO2, 95% air, humidified atmosphere, and split in a ratio 1:10, twice a week (untransfected and mock-transfected MDCK-C7 cells) or 1:6, once a week (MDCK-C7 cells stably transfected with constitutively active MEK1). After growth to a subconfluent state, cells were washed once, made quiescent by 24 h of incubation in FCS-free medium, and were then used for experiments. MDCK-C7 cells (106 cells/10-cm plate) were cotransfected by the Lipofectin technique with 2.5 μg of pREP4 expression vector (Invitrogen) together with either 12.5 μg of the empty pECE expression vector (mock-transfected cells) or 12.5 μg of the pECE expression vector containing a hemagglutinin (HA) epitope-tagged constitutively active MEK1 mutant (18Brunet A. Pagès G. Pouysségur J. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3379-3387Google Scholar). The constitutively active mutant of MEK1 (CA-MEK1) was designed by substitution of the regulatory phosphorylation sites, Ser218 and Ser222, with aspartic acid (S218D/S222D mutant) as described previously (18Brunet A. Pagès G. Pouysségur J. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3379-3387Google Scholar). 48 h after transfection, cells were subjected to hygromycin B selection (50 μg/ml) that killed nontransfected cells. Stable clones were picked up for analysis and passaged once a week. For stimulation protocols, quiescent MDCK cell clones C7 transfected with either CA-MEK1 or the empty vectors were incubated in the presence of 10% FCS for the respective periods of time and compared with unstimulated controls. Transfected MDCK-C7 cells were washed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and lysed in ice-cold Triton X-100 lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 50 mM NaF, 5 mM EDTA, 40 mMβ-glycerophosphate, 200 μM sodium orthovanadate, 0.1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μM pepstatin A, 1% Triton X-100) for 25 min at 4°C. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 15 min at 4°C. For the examination of cytokeratin and vimentin protein expression only, cells were harvested into 1 × Laemmli buffer, and total cell homogenates were analyzed. The protein content was determined using a microbicinchoninic acid assay (Pierce) with BSA as the standard. Cell lysates were matched for protein, separated on 12% gel SDS-PAGE, and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride microporous membrane. Subsequently membranes were blotted with one of the following specific antibodies: anti-P-ERK1,2, which detects phosphorylated tyrosine 204 of both ERK1 and ERK2 (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA), anti-MEK1 (generous gift of J. Pouysségur, Nice), anti-HA.11 (Babco, Richmond, CA), anti-cytokeratin (Progen, Heidelberg, Germany), or anti-vimentin (Sigma). The primary antibodies were detected using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (for ERK, MEK, and HA.11 antibodies) or horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (for cytokeratin and vimentin antibodies) visualized by Amersham Corp. ECL system after intensive washing of the sheets or, when anti-P-ERK1,2 antibodies were applied, using alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG visualized by Phototope™ chemiluminescent Western detection system (New England Biolabs). Transfected MDCK-C7 cells were washed three times with ice-cold PBS and lysed in ice-cold Triton X-100 lysis buffer for 25 min at 4°C. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 15 min at 4°C. The protein content was determined using a microbicinchoninic acid assay (Pierce) with BSA as a standard. Cell lysates were matched for protein and precleared with 2 μl of preimmune serum preadsorbed to 50 μl of protein A-Sepharose-coated beads for 1 h at 4°C. The precleared supernatants were further incubated overnight either with 2 μl of a polyclonal antibody recognizing only ERK2 (generous gift of M. J. Dunn, Milwaukee) (24Wang Y. Simonson M.S. Pouysségur J. Dunn M.J. Biochem. J. 1992; 287: 589-594Google Scholar, 25Schramek H. Sorokin A. Watson R.D. Dunn M.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: C40-C48Google Scholar) or with 4 μl of a polyclonal antibody recognizing p45 MEK1 (generous gift of J. Pouysségur, Nice) (13Pagès G. Brunet A. L'Allemain G. Pouysségur J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3003-3010Google Scholar) preadsorbed to protein A-Sepharose. Immunocomplexes were then used to measure ERK2 or MEK1 activity. For measurement of ERK2 activity the respective immunocomplexes were collected by centrifugation, washed four times with a washing buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 5 mM EGTA, 0.5% Triton X-100) and once with kinase buffer (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM dithiothreitol, and 10 mM p-nitrophenylphosphate) and were resuspended in a final volume of 40 μl of kinase buffer containing 0.25 mg/ml MBP, 50 μM ATP, and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. The reaction was initiated by incubation at 30°C and continued for 10 min. Thereafter, 40 μl of 2 × Laemmli sample buffer was added to terminate the reaction. Samples were then boiled for 3 min and subjected to 12% gel SDS-PAGE. The gels were stained in Coomassie Brilliant Blue, dried, and exposed for 1-2 h to Amersham Hyperfilm MP at −70°C with intensifying screens. In addition, kinase activity was determined by cutting the MBP bands and measuring the radioactivity in a liquid scintillation counter. MEK1 activity was determined by its ability to activate recombinant ERK2 (generous gift of D. Templeton, Cleveland) and hence phosphorylate MBP. The immunocomplexes were first incubated in kinase buffer containing 10 μg/ml recombinant ERK2 and 50 μM ATP at 30°C for 30 min. Thereafter, MBP (0.25 mg/ml) was added together with 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and incubated for another 15 min at 30°C. The reaction was terminated by addition of an equal volume of 2 × Laemmli buffer. Samples were boiled for 3 min at 90°C and subjected to 12% gel SDS-PAGE. The gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue, fixed, and dried for 3 h at 70°C. Finally the dried gels were exposed for 1-2 h to Amersham Hyperfilm MP at −70°C with intensifying screens. Furthermore, kinase activity was determined by cutting the MBP bands and measuring the radioactivity in a liquid scintillation counter. Untransfected, mock-transfected, and CA-MEK1-transfected MDCK-C7 cells were plated onto Flexiperm-slides (Heraeus, Hanau, Germany) and were rinsed twice in PBS before being fixed for 15 min at room temperature in a freshly prepared solution of 4% paraformaldehyde, PBS. Thereafter, slides were rinsed twice in PBS, and cells were permeabilized by exposure to 0.5% Triton X-100, PBS at room temperature for 10 min. After two further washing steps in PBS, the slides were incubated in the presence of 0.5% BSA, PBS. Antibody incubations were carried out for 30 min at room temperature in 0.1% BSA, PBS. To visualize cytokeratin a monoclonal mouse anti-panepithelial cytokeratin antibody was used, which recognizes type II cytokeratins 5 and 8 at a dilution of 1:100. A monoclonal mouse anti-vimentin antibody was used to visualize vimentin. Thereafter the slides were again washed twice in PBS and transferred to the secondary antibody solution (0.1% BSA, PBS) for 30 min containing Cy™-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG at a dilution of 1:1000. After two final washes in PBS, the slides were drained of excess liquid and covered by coverslips. The slides were examined on a Zeiss axiophot microscope using a Zeiss 20× objective. The number of cells per cm2 of culture dish was evaluated by light microscopy utilizing an inverted microscope equipped with a camera (Phillips LDH 0670/00) connected to a video graphic printer (Sony UP-850) and a superimposed test frame as described previously (22Schramek H. Schumacher M. Wilflingseder D. Oberleithner H. Pfaller W. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; (in press)Google Scholar). For measurement of cell number, quiescent MDCK-C7 cells, either mock-transfected or transfected with constitutively active MEK1, were stimulated with 10% FCS for 1, 2, 3, and 5 days and were compared at each time point to quiescent, unstimulated controls. One measurement (n = 1) represents the mean of cells/cm2 determined from 10 video prints randomly taken from one Petri dish at days 0, 1, 2, 3, and 5 each. The number of cells in Sub-G0/G1, G0/G1, S, and G2/M phase of the cell cycle was determined by flow cytometric DNA analysis. Single cell suspensions were prepared by treating the cells with a trypsin/EDTA mixture in PBS. Cell suspensions (1 × 106) were pelleted, resuspended in 200 μl of PBS, and fixed for at least 30 min at 4°C in 2 ml of 70% ice-cold ethanol, PBS. Cells were washed twice in PBS, resuspended in 800 μl of PBS to which was added 100 μl of 1 mg/ml RNase A (Sigma) and 100 μl of 400 μg/ml propidium iodide and allowed to incubate for 30 min at 37°C. Cells were analyzed on a FACStar Plus flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson, Aalst, Europe) with laser excitation at 488 nm using a 639-nm band pass filter to collect the red propidium iodide fluorescence. Forward and side light scatter were also recorded as indices of cell size and granularity, respectively. Analysis was carried out using the CELL QUEST™ analysis program. Statistical analyses were performed using the statistical program INSTAT 2.01 for the Apple Macintosh computer. An unpaired Student's t test was used to test for statistical significance. Results were expressed as the mean ± S.D. (n = 5 independent experiments). A probability of 0.05 or less was deemed statistically significant. When grown for 2 weeks in alkaline (pH 7.7) culture medium, cloned MDCK-C7 cells dedifferentiate, exhibit spindle-shaped morphology, and lack contact inhibition as well as monolayer formation (22Schramek H. Schumacher M. Wilflingseder D. Oberleithner H. Pfaller W. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; (in press)Google Scholar, 23Wünsch S. Gekle M. Kersting U. Schuricht B. Oberleithner H. J. Cell. Physiol. 1995; 164: 164-171Google Scholar). They maintain their altered phenotype when subsequently cultured in standard medium (pH 7.4) (22Schramek H. Schumacher M. Wilflingseder D. Oberleithner H. Pfaller W. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; (in press)Google Scholar, 23Wünsch S. Gekle M. Kersting U. Schuricht B. Oberleithner H. J. Cell. Physiol. 1995; 164: 164-171Google Scholar). With respect to the activation of different members of the MAPK family of protein kinases, we have recently reported that these dedifferentiated MDCK-C7Focus (MDCK-C7F) cells show increased basal and serum-stimulated ERK2 stimulation but slightly decreased basal and anisomycin-induced JNK1 activity (22Schramek H. Schumacher M. Wilflingseder D. Oberleithner H. Pfaller W. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; (in press)Google Scholar). To evaluate the role of the MEK1-ERK2 signaling module in epithelial differentiation/dedifferentiation of MDCK-C7 cells, we performed stable transfections of MDCK-C7 cells utilizing a HA epitope-tagged constitutively active MEK1 mutant (S218D/S222D mutant) (18Brunet A. Pagès G. Pouysségur J. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3379-3387Google Scholar), which is recognized by the polyclonal rabbit antibody HA.11. In addition, a polyclonal antibody raised against the MEK1 Xenopus NH2-terminal peptide was used to compare the level of expression of the ectopically expressed kinase with that of the endogenous one. Fig. 1 (left) shows that the polyclonal HA.11 antibody recognizes a 47-kDa protein only in MDCK-C7 cells transfected with constitutively active MEK1 (CA-MEK1/clone 1). In contrast, the polyclonal MEK1 antibody recognizes a single protein of 45 kDa in cells transfected with the empty vectors (mock-transfected cells) and a doublet of 45 and 47 kDa in transfected MDCK-C7 cells (Fig. 1 right). Altogether we obtained three MDCK-C7 clones (clones 1, 4, and 5) carrying the HA-tagged constitutively active MEK1 construct (CA-MEK1/1, 1/4, 1/5) out of a total of six hygromycin B-selected clones (CA-MEK1/1 to 6). Utilizing a polyclonal phosphospecific ERK antibody, which detects phosphorylated tyrosine 204 of both ERK1 and ERK2, we found that especially ERK2 phosphorylation was substantially augmented in the three CA-MEK1-positive MDCK-C7 cell clones when compared with mock-transfected cells (Fig. 2A). In addition, and in contrast to quiescent mock-transfected MDCK-C7 cells, ERK2 activity was increased 5.5-fold in quiescent MDCK-C7 cells stably transfected with HA-tagged CA-MEK1 (Fig. 2B). When grown for 24 h in the presence of 0.5% or 10% FCS, ERK2 activity was stimulated 2.4- and 1.5-fold in MDCK-C7 cells expressing the CA-MEK1 construct as compared with mock-transfected cells (Fig. 2B). Thus, stable transfection of MDCK-C7 cells with a constitutively active MEK1 mutant results in an increased phosphorylation of ERK1 and ERK2, which coincided with increased basal and serum-stimulated enzymatic ERK2 activity. Measurements of MEK1 activity by determining the ability of immunoprecipitated MEK1 to activate recombinant ERK2 and hence phosphorylate MBP confirmed these results. As depicted in Fig. 2C, MEK1 activity was 3.0-fold higher in quiescent CA-MEK1-transfected cells as compared with their mock-transfected counterparts.Fig. 2ERK1,2 phosphorylation and ERK2 and MEK1 activation in CA-MEK1-transfected MDCK-C7 cells. A, six hygromycin B-selected, CA-MEK1-transfected cell clones (CA-MEK1/1 to 1/6) and one out of four hygromycin B-selected, mock-transfected control clones were grown in the presence of 10% FCS, analyzed by Western blotting, and probed with an anti-phospho-ERK antibody, which detects phosphorylated tyrosine 204 of both ERK1 and ERK2, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Unphosphorylated ERK2 protein served as a negative control, and phosphorylated ERK2 protein was utilized as a positive control (data not shown). Asterisks indicate the phosphorylated ERK isoforms (ERK1* and ERK2*, respectively). One representative Western blot of three separate experiments is depicted. B, subconfluent mock-transfected MDCK-C7 cells (Mock) and cell clone 1 of CA-MEK1-transfected MDCK-C7 cells (CA-MEK1/1) were made quiescent for 24 h (∅ FCS) or grown for 24 h in the presence of either 0.5% FCS or 10% FCS. ERK2 activity was determined in these cell lysates by immunoprecipitating ERK2 and measuring its ability to phosphorylate MBP as a substrate. In lane 1 the experiment was performed in the absence of cell lysate (∅ Lysate). The results from one representative ERK2 activity assay of four separate experiments are depicted. C, MEK1 activity was measured in lysates from quiescent mock- and CA-MEK1-transfected MDCK-C7 cells immunoprecipitated with anti-p45 MEK1 antiserum. Recombinant ERK2 was used as a substrate for immunoprecipitated MEK1. MEK1 activity was determined by its ability to phosphorylate and activate recombinant ERK2 and hence to phosphorylate MBP. Lane 3 shows MEK1 activity assay of an unstimulated MDCK-C7 lysate without any addition of recombinant ERK2 (∅ recomb. ERK2), and in lane 4 MBP was omitted (∅ MBP). One representative MEK1 activity assay of three separate experiments is depicted.View Large"

Extracts of the human cell line 46BR.1G1, in which DNA ligase I is mutationally altered, supported aberrant in vitro SV40 DNA replication; the joining of Okazaki fragments was defective, and unligated intermediates were unstable. Human DNA ligase I, but not DNA ligase III or bacteriophage T4 DNA ligase, complemented both defects in 46BR.1G1 extracts. The catalytic domain of DNA ligase I was 10-fold less effective in complementation experiments than the full-length protein, indicating that the amino-terminal region of the enzyme is required for efficient lagging strand DNA replication. Moreover, in vitro SV40 DNA replication in normal human cell extracts was inhibited by an excess of either full-length DNA ligase I or the amino-terminal region of the protein, but not by the catalytic domain.

We have cloned the 5′-flanking region of the human TPO gene and analyzed its promoter activity. The human TPO gene promoter lacks a TATA box and directs transcription initiation at multiple sites over a 50-nucleotide region. Transient expression in a human liver cell line (PLC) of promoter fragment-luciferase reporter gene constructs containing a series of 5′-truncated sequences or site-directed mutations identified a sequence 5′-ACTTCCG-3′ from −69 to −63 as a positive cis-acting element for high level expression of TPO gene. This sequence contains a core motif (C/A)GGA(A/T) for Ets family proteins in the noncoding strand. Gel mobility shift assays performed with nuclear protein from PLC cells identified a DNA binding protein(s) specific for the element. Anti-E4TF1-60(GABPα) or anti-E4TF1-53/47(GABPβ) antibodies supershifted the complex in gel shift assay. Furthermore, co-expression of E4TF1-60 and E4TF1-53/47 squelched TPO gene expression in PLC and HepG2 cells.

Rosenberg R.D. Blood. 1995; 85: 2720-2730Google Scholar). More recently, Fiedler et al. (6Fielder P.J. Gurney A.L. Stefanich E. Marian M. Moore M.W. Carver-Moore K. de Sauvage F.J. Blood. 1996; 87: 2154-2161Google Scholar) reported that the level of TPO gene expression remains constant, but the level of TPO in circulation was determined by the rate of Mpl-mediated uptake and destruction of TPO by platelets in both normal and mutant mice (c-mpl−/−). On the other hand, TPO mRNA levels in bone marrow cells were inversely related to platelet count while hepatic or renal TPO message were unaltered (7McCarty J.M. Sprugel K.H. Fox N.E. Sabath D.E. Kaushansky K. Blood. 1995; 86: 3668-3675Google Scholar). Bone marrow cells rather than liver or kidney were considered to be a more physiologically relevant source of TPO (7McCarty J.M. Sprugel K.H. Fox N.E. Sabath D.E. Kaushansky K. Blood. 1995; 86: 3668-3675Google Scholar). However, Northern blot and reverse transcriptase-PCR analysis indicated that TPO was expressed mainly in liver and also slightly in many tissues such as kidney, smooth muscle, spleen, and bone marrow. Thus, further work is required to assess the significance of TPO gene expression in various tissues, including liver, for regulating the circulating level of TPO. The human TPO gene locus has been mapped to chromosome 3q26 or q27, a site where a number of chromosomal abnormalities associated with elevated platelet counts and increased bone marrow megakaryocytes were reported in patients with acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (8Pintado T.

Thus, the structure of 5′-flanking region of the human TPO gene, especially that of the promoter region, is still controversial. In this article, we report the structure and functional characterization of the human TPO gene promoter. Our data demonstrate that the human TPO gene has multiple transcription initiation sites and lacks a putative TATA box near the initiation sites. We identified a strong cis-acting ets motif, ACTTCCG, at −69 to −63 from the first initiation site for an optimal expression of the human TPO gene. Furthermore, E4TF1/GABP/NRF-2 (16Gugneja S.

The functional significance of the element and its trans-acting factor in TPO gene expression is discussed. The two human hepatocarcinoma cells, PLC and HepG2, and the human cervical carcinoma cell HeLa cell line used in this study were originally obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. These cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Iscove medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml) at 37°C in a 5% CO2 incubator. A human TPO cDNA from 651 to 1070 nucleotides (2Bartley T.D. Bogenberger I. Hunt P. Li Y.- S. Lu H.S. Martin F. Chang M.- S. Samal B. Nichol J.L. Swift S. Johnson M.J. Hsu R.- Y. Parkeer V.P.

Cell. 1994; 77: 1117-1124Google Scholar) was amplified by reverse transcriptase-PCR using a total RNA of human adult liver with a sense primer (5′-AATGCCATCTTCCTGAGCTT-3′) and an antisense primer (5′-CCTGTGTCTGATGTTCCTGA-3′), and used as a probe. Approximately 1 × 105 plaques of the human genomic library in the EMBL3 vector, a gift from Dr. Fukumaki in Kyushu University, were screened using an ECL labeling and detection kit (Amersham Corp.). One positive clone containing the 5′-flanking region of TPO gene was obtained, subcloned into the pUC19 plasmid, and sequenced by the dideoxy sequence method (19Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Google Scholar) using a SQ-5500 DNA sequencer (Hitachi). Poly(A)+ RNAs from PLC, HepG2, and HeLa cells were obtained using a micro mRNA purification kit (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). 10 μg of poly(A)+RNA were separated on a 1% formaldehyde-agarose gel and transferred to a Hybond N+ membrane (Amersham Corp.). The membrane was hybridized with a TPO cDNA probe in 5 × SSC, 1% SDS, 50% formamide at 42°C overnight. The membrane was washed twice with 1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at room temperature for 15 min, twice with 0.1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at 65°C for 5 min and then subjected to autoradiography at −80°C for 24 h. The cDNA fragment from 651 to 1070 was radiolabeled with [α-32P]dCTP (6000 Ci/mmol), using a megaprime labeling kit (Amersham Corp.), and was used as a probe. Poly(A)+ RNAs from human adult liver, PLC cells, and HepG2 cells were analyzed to determine the transcription initiation sites using a rapid amplification of 5′-cDNA end (5′-RACE) method and an RNase protection assay. The 5′-RACE analysis was performed using a Marathon cDNA amplification kit (CLONTECH). After the first-strand cDNA was synthesized by incubating 1 μg of mRNA with an oligo(dT) primer and Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase at 45°C for 60 min, the second-strand cDNA was synthesized with a mixture of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I, RNase H, and E. coli DNA ligase (20Gubler U. Hoffman B.J. Gene (Amst.). 1983; 25: 263-269Google Scholar). After blunt-ending with T4 DNA polymerase, the double-stranded cDNA was ligated to the Marathon cDNA adaptor. A PCR reaction was then performed with a gene-specific internal antisense primer T1 (5′-TGTGAAGGACATGGGAGTCA-3′), which was complementary to nucleotides 329-348 of the TPO cDNA in exon 3 (1de Sauvage F.J.

FEBS Lett. 1994; 353: 57-61Google Scholar), and the nested adaptor primer, AP2 (5′-ACTCACTATAGGGCTCGAGCGGC-3′). The amplified products were then subcloned into the pGEM-T vector (Promega), and a total of 31 independent clones were sequenced. For the RNase protection assay, the genomic fragment from −239 to +100 was amplified by PCR and subcloned into the plasmid pGEM4Z (Promega). The plasmid was linearized by EcoRI digestion, and the antisense cRNA probe was generated with T7 RNA polymerase using a mixture of 1 mM each ATP, CTP, and UTP, and 10 μM [α-32P]GTP (3000 Ci/mmol). After 1 μg of cRNA product and 20 μg of poly(A)+ RNAs were mixed, heated at 80°C for 10 min, and hybridized in 30 μl of hybridization buffer of 40 mM PIPES, pH 6.4, 400 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, and 80% formamide at 45°C overnight, the mixture was digested by RNase A (10 μg/ml) and RNase T1 (0.5 μg/ml, Sigma) at 30°C for 30 min. The protected RNA fragments were recovered, resolved on a 6% sequencing gel, and subjected to autoradiography at −80°C for 24 h. Human TPO promoter-luciferase reporter plasmids were constructed by cloning various lengths of the 5′-flanking sequence of the TPO gene into the multicloning sites of pLUC-Basic (Promega). The plasmid pUC19-T5500, containing a 5.5-kb fragment of the 5′-flanking region, was used as a template for PCR to generate fragments containing from −1318 to +100, from −107 to +100, from −88 to +100, and from −58 to +100 of the TPO gene, respectively. Briefly, the required fragments of the human TPO gene were amplified by using primer sets containing KpnI and BglII sites at each end, and the resulting fragments were subcloned into KpnI and BglII sites of the pLUC-Basic to obtain pLUC-T1318, pLUC-T107, pLUC-T88, and pLUC-T58, respectively. pLUC-T39 containing −39 to +100 fragment was obtained by subcloning SacI/BglII fragment of pUC19-T5500 into the SacI/BglII sites of pLUC-Basic. For the plasmids obtained by using PCR, the sequence of each clone was confirmed. The plasmid pLUC-T735 was obtained after self-ligation of the large fragment generated by digestion of pLUC-T1318 with SmaI and PvuII, and pLUC-T397 was obtained by self-ligation of the large fragment after pLUC-T1318 was digested with SmaI and AvrII and treated by the Klenow fragment to make the AvrII site blunt-ended. pLUC-T158 was constructed by subcloning a 258-bp fragment of BamHI and HindIII digestion of pLUC-T1318 into BglII/HindIII sites of pLUC-Basic. Plasmid pLUC-T4063 was constructed as follows. First, a 5500-bp HindIII/EcoRI fragment from pUC19-T5500 was subcloned into the HindIII and EcoRI sites of pLUC-Basic, and the resulting pLUC-T5500 was completely digested by EcoRI and then partially digested by AvrII to obtain a 8800-bp fragment. pLUC-T735 described above was also digested with EcoRI and AvrII to obtain a 800-bp fragment. Finally, both 8800- and 800-bp fragments were ligated to produce pLUC-T4063. Plasmids containing the mutations, as defined in the figure legends, were constructed using the plasmid pLUC-T158 as the matrix by an overlap extension PCR protocol (21Pan J. McEver R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22600-22608Google Scholar). Briefly, two separate PCR products, one for each half of the hybrid product, were generated with either an antisense- or a sense-mutated oligonucleotide and one outside primer. The two products were mixed, and a second PCR was then performed using the two outside primers. The product was digested with BamHI and HindIII and ligated into BglII/HindIII sites of pLUC-Basic. The inserts were sequenced to confirm the intended mutations. All the plasmids of pLUC-TPO fusion genes and pCI-β-galactosidase gene that was used for internal control of transfection were purified using the QIAGEN plasmid purification kit (QIAGEN, Inc.) and at least two different batches of plasmids for each construct were tested for transfections. Cells were plated on a 35-mm dish at a density adjusted so that they reached 70-80% confluence (approximately 3 × 105 cells) prior to transfection. 4 μg of each plasmid DNA in 100 μl of 0.3 M NaCl and 20 μg of cationic liposome (Promega) in 100 μl of H2O were mixed and added to the cells. After 60 min of incubation at 37°C, the transfection medium was replaced by 2 ml of complete medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. After an additional 40-h culture, the cells were lysed by 150 μl of Picagene reporter lysis buffer LCβ (Toyoinki) and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min to remove cell debris. The supernatants were assayed for luciferase and β-galactosidase activities using the luciferase assay and β-galactosidase assay systems (Promega), respectively. The luciferase activities were normalized to those of β-galactosidase and expressed as the percentage of that of a plasmid as described in the figure legends. PLC and HeLa cell nuclear extracts were prepared from 1 × 108 cells according to the method of Dignam et al. (22Dignam J.D. Levovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Google Scholar). In vitro translated proteins were prepared by using 1 μg of pET3d plasmids containing each cDNA for E4TF1-60, E4TF1-53, or E4TF1-47 (23Sawada J. Goto M. Sawa C. Watanabe H. Handa H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1396-1402Google Scholar) in the TNT T7-coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega). For gel mobility shift assay, oligonucleotides were labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (6000 Ci/mmol) and T4 polynucleotide kinase. Approximately 1 ng of the labeled oligonucleotide (10000 cpm) was mixed with 2 μl (5 μg of protein) of nuclear extract or 1 μl of in vitro translated proteins in a total of 20 μl of binding buffer (15 mM HEPES, pH 7.9, 50 mM KCl, 15 mM NaCl, 4 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 10 units/ml Trasylol) containing 1 μg of poly(dI·dC). After incubation at room temperature for 20 min, the reaction mixture was separated on a 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel with 0.5 × TBE buffer (40 mM Tris borate, 1 mM EDTA). The gel was dried and subjected to autoradiography at −80°C for 24 h. For supershift experiments, 1 μl of control antibody or 0.5 μl of polyclonal rabbit antibody against either E4TF1-60 or E4TF1-53/47 was added to the reaction mixture 20 min after the addition of probe, and the mixture was further incubated for 20 min at room temperature. The human TPO genomic clone EMBL3-T1 was isolated as described under “Materials and Methods.” The clone contained a 15-kb insert containing 5 kb of the 5′-flanking region (Fig. 1A). Southern blot analysis of human genomic DNA with a DNA fragment from this clone revealed that restriction fragments obtained by HindIII and BamHI digests were identical in size to those in the clone, indicating that no major DNA rearrangements occurred during isolation of the clone (data not shown). The 4876 nucleotides of the 5′-flanking region and the first exon were sequenced on both strands, and a portion of the sequence that encompasses transcription initiation site(s) is shown in Fig. 1B (see also Fig. 2).Fig. 2Identification of the transcription initiation sites of the human TPO gene. A, 5′-RACE analysis of mRNA from human adult liver. The products obtained by 5′-RACE reaction were subcloned into pGEM-T vector, and a total of 31 clones were sequenced as described under “Materials and Methods.” Sequences of fusion with adaptor of four independent clones were shown. Arrows indicate the positions of the 5′ ends of the cDNA obtained. B, RNase protection analysis. 20 μg of poly(A)+ RNAs from human adult liver, HepG2 cells, PLC cells, or yeast tRNA were hybridized with a cRNA probe spanning the nucleotides from −239 to +100. After treatment with RNase, the protected products were separated on a 6% sequencing gel. Arrows at +24, +25, and +51 indicate the protected products. Arrow at −189 represents the position of expected band when the TPO gene transcription initiated at exon 0 of Chang et al. (14Chang M.-S. McNinch J. Basu R. Shutter J. Hsu R.-Y. Perkins C. Mar V. Suggs S. Welcher A. Li L. Lu H. Bartley T. Hunt P. Martin F. Samal B. Bogenberger J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 511-514Google Scholar). C, summary of the transcription initiation sites. Arrowheads and arrows indicate the positions of the initiation sites determined by 5′-RACE and RNase protection analysis, respectively. The number of clones obtained by 5′-RACE analysis were also shown below each arrowhead.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Northern blot analysis of 5 μg of poly(A)+ RNA from PLC, HepG2, and HeLa cells showed the presence of a 1.8-kb single band in both PLC and HepG2 mRNAs, but no band was detectable in HeLa mRNA, even after a 3-fold longer exposure (data not shown). To determine the transcription initiation sites of the human TPO gene, both 5′-RACE and RNase protection assays were performed as described under “Materials and Methods.” As shown in Fig. 2 A and C, 5′-RACE assay of human adult liver cDNA revealed a total of six initiation sites from +1 to +51 nucleotides relative to the first initiation site. Among 31 clones analyzed, five clones began at +1, one clone at +8, two clones at +11, 14 clones at +24, seven clones at +25, and the other two clones at +51. Thus, the initiation sites are clustered between at +1 and +51, with the major sites at +24 and +25. RNase protection assays were also performed using a cRNA probe from −239 to +100 nucleotides of the human TPO gene. The results showed three major RNase-protected bands at +24, +25, and +51 (Fig. 2 B and C), and their positions matched those of the most prominent sites determined by 5′-RACE assay. Similar results were obtained when mRNAs from HepG2 or PLC cells were analyzed, indicating that the same transcription initiation sites as in adult liver are employed in these two cell lines (data not shown). A putative TATA box was not observed in any promoter region of the multi-initiation sites (see Fig. 1B). Chang et al. (14Chang M.-S. McNinch J. Basu R. Shutter J. Hsu R.-Y. Perkins C. Mar V. Suggs S. Welcher A. Li L. Lu H. Bartley T. Hunt P. Martin F. Samal B. Bogenberger J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 511-514Google Scholar) recently reported the existence of exon 0 at a more 5′-upstream region than shown in Fig. 1. If that were the case, a protected band at −189 must be detected in our RNase protection assay, since their exon 2, which is from −189 to +114, should be protected by our cRNA probe of −239 to +100. However, as shown in Fig. 2B, no such protected band at the −189 position (indicated by an arrow) was observed. Thus, the significance of exon 0 described by Chang et al. could not be assessed in our assay. To localize the region essential for human TPO gene expression, a series of 5′- to 3′-deletion mutants were generated and transiently expressed in PLC cells (Fig. 3A). Since PLC cells expressed the TPO gene and employed the same transcription initiation sites as adult human liver (Fig. 2), we used the PLC cell line to assay the promoter activity. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that the transcription of the reporter gene also initiated from several start sites that were essentially the same as in endogenous TPO gene (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 3B, all the plasmids containing 5′ deletions of various lengths from −4063 to −88 promoted high level expression of luciferase activity that was approximately 14-25 times higher than the background of pLUC-Basic. This indicated the motifs observed in the region from −4063 to −88 had no significant regulatory effect, while pLUC-T158 reproducibly showed a 1.3-2-fold higher activity than the other constructs. This might suggest the existence of an inhibitory element(s) from −397 to −158 and an enhancing element(s) from −158 to −107. In contrast, a further deletion to −58 resulted in an extreme reduction of activity to about 13% of that of pLUC-T88. The results clearly indicate that a positive regulatory element(s) is located from −88 to −58, and this region is essential for optimal transcription of the TPO gene. The pLUC-T39 plasmid still showed as much activity as pLUC-T58, 2.6 times higher than pLUC-Basic. We next transfected the deletion mutants into HeLa cells, which do not express the TPO gene. Fig. 3C shows that HeLa cells did express the pLUC-T58 reporter gene to an equivalent level to that in PLC cells, indicating that the 3′-sequence from −58 functions as a minimal promoter in both PLC and HeLa cells. However, the proximal cis-element(s) from −88 to −58 increased the expression only 1.8-fold in HeLa cells compared with a significant activation in PLC cells (6.2-fold). This result suggests that the promoter of the TPO gene can function in HeLa cells but that the cis-element from −88 to −58 supports tissue-specific activation only in PLC cells. We next introduced clustered mutations into the plasmid pLUC-T158. As shown in Fig. 4 the activities of mutants, M5, 6, 8, 9, and 10, all showed 75-80% reduction as compared with that of pLUC-T158, and M3, 7, and 11 exhibited small deviations or changes from the control, while M4 showed a slightly enhanced activity (50%). The M5 mutations introduced into the longer 5′ sequence, pLUC-T1318-M5 and pLUC-T4063-M5, also reduced the activities. The data clearly indicate that the sequence ACTTCCG from −69 to −63 functions as a major positive cis-element for the efficient expression of the TPO gene. It was also noted that ACTTCCG contains a core sequence of ets motif (C/A)GGA(A/T) in the noncoding"

In this study we have characterized the specificity of 54CP, a chloroplast homologue of SRP54 which is located in the chloroplast stroma. We have used a nascent chain cross-linking approach to detect the interactions of 54CP with heterologous endoplasmic reticulum-targeting signals. 54CP functions as a bona fide signal recognition factor which can discriminate between functional and non-functional targeting signals. Using a range of authentic thylakoid precursor proteins we found that 54CP discriminates between thylakoid-targeting signals, interacting with only a subset of protein precursors. Thus, the light-harvesting chlorophyll a/b-binding protein, cytochrome f, and the Rieske FeS protein all showed strong cross-linking products with 54CP. In contrast, no cross-linking to the 23- and 33-kDa proteins of the oxygen-evolving complex were detected. The selectivity of 54CP correlates with the hydrophobicity of the thylakoid-targeting signal and, in the case of light-harvesting chlorophyll a/b-binding protein, with previously determined transport/integration requirements.

https://openalex.org/W1993374805,"We examine the generality of transcription factor-mediated chromatin remodeling by monitoring changes in chromatin structure in a yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) episome outside of the context of a natural promoter. The episome has a well defined chromatin structure and a binding site for the transcription factor GAL4 but lacks a nearby functional TATA element or transcription start site, so that changes in chromatin structure are unlikely to be caused by transcription. To separate changes caused by binding and by activation domains, we use both GAL4 and a chimeric, hormone-dependent activator consisting of the GAL4 DNA-binding domain, an estrogen receptor (ER) hormone-binding domain, and a VP16 activation domain (Louvion, J.-F., Havaux-Copf, B. and Picard, D. (1993) Gene (Amst.) 131, 129-134). Both GAL4 and GAL4·ER·VP16 show very little perturbation of chromatin structure in their nonactivating configurations. Substantial additional perturbation occurs upon activation. This additional perturbation is marked by changes in micrococcal nuclease cleavage patterns, restriction endonuclease accessibility, and DNA topology and is not seen with the nonactivating derivative GAL4·ER. Remodeling by GAL4·ER·VP16 is detectable within 15 min following hormone addition and is complete within 45 min, suggesting that replication is not required. We conclude that activation domains can exert a major influence on chromatin remodeling by increasing binding affinity and/or by recruitment of other chromatin remodeling activities and that this remodeling can occur outside the context of a bona fide promoter.

Transcriptional induction in eukaryotes requires binding of activators to promoter elements termed enhancers (called upstream activator sequences (UASs) 1The abbreviations used are: UASupstream activator sequenceMNasemicrococcal nucleaseERestrogen receptor. in yeast). Binding of a transcriptional activator in its activating form results in recruitment or reconfiguration of a preinitiation complex in a form competent to allow initiation and elongation by RNA polymerase II. These events occur in the context of chromatin, which means that histone proteins are available to compete with activators and components of the preinitiation complex for binding to DNA. One function of transcriptional activators may be to help overcome nucleosomal repression of transcription, particularly at the site of preinitiation complex formation (1Workman J.L. Taylor I.C.A. Kingston R.E. Cell. 1991; 64: 533-544Google Scholar). upstream activator sequence micrococcal nuclease estrogen receptor. Gene activation is often accompanied by perturbations in chromatin structure. For some genes, this perturbation appears to be essential for proper transcriptional regulation (2Axelrod J.D. Reagan M.S. Majors J. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 857-869Google Scholar, 3Hirschhorn J.N. Brown S.A. Clark C.D. Winston F. Genes & Dev. 1992; 6: 2288-2298Google Scholar, 4Straka C. Horz W. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 361-368Google Scholar). In some instances, specific effects of activation domains have been observed. The yeast activator GAL4 can bind to promoter sites in both activating and nonactivating forms; this has allowed the detection of subtle effects on chromatin structure in the GAL1-10 promoter that require an unmasked activation domain (2Axelrod J.D. Reagan M.S. Majors J. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 857-869Google Scholar, 5Fedor M.J. Kornberg R.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 1721-1732Google Scholar, 6Lohr D. Lopez J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27671-27678Google Scholar). Another transcriptional activator, PHO4, perturbs chromatin structure at the PHO5 promoter in an activation domain-dependent manner (7Svaren J. Schmitz J. Horz W. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4856-4862Google Scholar). The thyroid hormone receptor-retinoid X receptor heterodimer binds without perturbing chromatin structure in its unliganded state; the addition of hormone results in a local perturbation of chromatin structure in the TRβA gene promoter (8Wong J. Shi Y.-B. Wolffe A.P. Genes & Dev. 1995; 9: 2696-2711Google Scholar). The above examples of chromatin remodeling by transcription factors occur at natural promoters. Although chromatin remodeling under activating conditions can occur in nonfunctional promoters having mutated TATA boxes (3Hirschhorn J.N. Brown S.A. Clark C.D. Winston F. Genes & Dev. 1992; 6: 2288-2298Google Scholar, 9Fascher K.D. Schmitz J. Horz W. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 231: 658-667Google Scholar), other cis-acting promoter elements could still be involved in this process. Perturbation of a positioned nucleosome by GAL4 has been examined outside of the context of a natural promoter in a plasmid episome in yeast (10Morse R.H. Science. 1993; 262: 1563-1566Google Scholar). In this study, the GAL4 site was near the center of a positioned nucleosome (when GAL4 was absent); GAL4 expression resulted in micrococcal nuclease (MNase) cleavage sites, indicative of nucleosome perturbation. This perturbation appeared stronger, as assessed by the intensities of the MNase cleavages, under activating conditions. The mechanism by which an activation domain causes chromatin remodeling remains unknown. To examine the generality of transcription factor-mediated chromatin remodeling and to increase our understanding of this important step in transcriptional activation, we have examined the ability of GAL4 and a chimeric activator, GAL4·ER·VP16, to perturb chromatin structure in the yeast episome TALS, which has an exceptionally well defined chromatin structure. In yeast haploid α cells, the repressor complex α2·MCM1 helps to incorporate TALS into strongly positioned nucleosomes (11Roth S.Y. Dean A. Simpson R.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 2247-2260Google Scholar). One of these nucleosomes contains a GAL4 binding site, which derives from the GAL3 promoter (12Bajwa W. Torchia T.E. Hopper J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 3439-3447Google Scholar). We show that both GAL4 and GAL4·ER·VP16 perturb TALS chromatin most strongly in their activating configurations, and we discuss possible mechanisms by which an unmasked transcriptional activation domain could remodel chromatin in vivo. Introduction of TA17Δ80 into yeast has been described (10Morse R.H. Science. 1993; 262: 1563-1566Google Scholar). TALS (11Roth S.Y. Dean A. Simpson R.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 2247-2260Google Scholar) and TALS4 (13Kladde M.P. Xu M. Simpson R.T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6290-6300Google Scholar), in which the UASGAL has been removed by mutagenesis (generous gift of M. Kladde), were excised from pUC19 sequences by digestion with HindIII and religated before introduction into yeast. GAL4·ER·VP16 was expressed from the plasmid pHCA, here referred to as pRS313GAL4·ER·VP16 (Ref. 14Louvion J.-F. Havaux-Copf B. Picard D. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 131: 129-134Google Scholar; generously provided by D. Picard) or from pRS416GAL4·ER·VP16, which was constructed by ligation of the ClaI-SpeI fragment encompassing the GAL4·ER·VP16 gene from pRS313GAL4·ER·VP16 into pRS416 (Ref. 15Christianson T.W. Sikorski R.S. Dante M. Shero J.H. Hieter P. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 110: 119-122Google Scholar). The expression vector for GAL4·ER was constructed by deletion of the SacI fragment bearing the VP16 coding sequence from the expression vector for GAL4·ER·VP16. For experiments in which perturbation of chromatin by GAL4 was monitored, yeast cells contained the multicopy GAL4 expression vector pRS425GAL4 (10Morse R.H. Science. 1993; 262: 1563-1566Google Scholar). The plasmid pCL1 (16Fields S. Song O. Nature. 1989; 340: 245-246Google Scholar) was used to express GAL4 from the ADH1 promoter. The reporter construct used for β-galactosidase assays was pRS314-17Δ80lacZ (10Morse R.H. Science. 1993; 262: 1563-1566Google Scholar).

Cells were grown in dropout media (Bio 101) in the presence of 2% glucose, 1.5% raffinose, or 2% galactose. β-Estradiol (Sigma) was added from a 5 mM stock in ethanol to 0.1 μM 3-4 h before harvesting cells or assaying for β-galactosidase activity. β-Galactosidase activity was assayed as described (20Miller J.H.

Yeast cells (0.4-1.0 liter) were grown at 30°C to an optical density at 600 nm between 0.6 and 1.6. Yeast nuclei (22Shimizu M. Roth S.Y. Szent-Gyorgyi C. Simpson R.T. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3033-3041Google Scholar) or spheroplast lysates (23Fedor M.J. Lue N.F. Kornberg R.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 204: 109-127Google Scholar) were prepared and digested as described previously with micrococcal nuclease for 10 min at 37°C at concentrations varying from 0 to 50 units/ml. Cleavage patterns did not vary within this range of concentrations. For SstI digestion, the same buffer was used with the addition of 1/10 volume of 10 × enzyme buffer supplied by the manufacturer. Control samples were incubated for 30 min without enzyme; these did not show the specific SstI cleavage seen when enzyme was added. TALS chromatin prepared under identical conditions from FY24 and YNN282 strains showed identical MNase cleavage patterns and topoisomer distributions. For digestion of naked DNA, samples were first treated with proteinase K, extracted with phenol and chloroform, and then taken up in 300 μl of 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 1 mM EDTA, 20 mM Tris·HCl, pH 8.0, 2 mM CaCl2, 5 mM MgCl2, or in 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 2 mM CaCl2, 5 mM MgCl2 and digested as above. Digestions were stopped by the addition of 55 μl of 5% SDS, 5 mg/ml proteinase K to 300-μl reactions, and after >2 h at 37°C, samples were extracted with phenol and chloroform and the DNA was precipitated. Pellets were taken up in 100 μl of 10 mM Tris·HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA, and treated with RNase A (40 μg); samples from spheroplast lysates were cleaned over 1-ml G50 spin columns (24Sambrook J.

Nature. 1980; 286: 854-860Google Scholar), aliquots of 25-40 μl were digested with EcoRV for 3-4 h, and the DNA was precipitated and then electrophoresed on 1.2% agarose gels at 4 V/cm for 5-6 h. SstI-cut samples were analyzed similarly but on smaller gels run for shorter times. Bromphenol blue was omitted from sample buffers. DNA was transferred to nylon membranes (Duralon UV; Stratagene) by capillary action and hybridized with random primer-labeled probes as described (24Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Hybridization and washing were as described (27Church G. Gilbert W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 1991-1995Google Scholar). Probes used were the 200-bp EcoRV-XbaI fragment (see Figs. 2, 3, 5, and 6) and the 231-bp EcoRV-HindIII fragment (Fig. 1) from TRP1ARS1 or identical fragments prepared by polymerase chain reaction. Marker lanes contained 0.5 ng of a ϕX/HaeIII digest, and labeled ϕX/HaeIII DNA was included with the hybridization probe. Chromatin was prepared from at least two independent clones for all MNase analyses in at least three independent preparations (total). SstI digestion experiments were done with at least three independent chromatin preparations for all conditions examined.Fig. 3Nucleosome perturbation in the yeast episome TALS by GAL4 under activating and nonactivating conditions.

Upper panel, nuclei were prepared from yeast cells (strain FY24) harboring TA17Δ80 and either pRS425GAL4 (left part, lanes 1-4) or pRS416GAL4·ER·VP16 (right part, lanes 5-9) and digested with micrococcal nuclease. Cells were grown in glucose (lanes 1-2 and 5-9) or galactose (lanes 3-4) in the absence (lanes 1-7) or presence (lanes 8-9) of β-estradiol, as indicated. Micrococcal nuclease cleavage sites were mapped clockwise relative to the EcoRV site as indicated. Samples were digested with increasing amounts of micrococcal nuclease from the outer lanes of each panel toward the centers. Bands indicated by stars are cleaved in naked DNA (data not shown and Ref. 10Morse R.H. Science. 1993; 262: 1563-1566Google Scholar) and protected by nucleosomes I and II (lanes 1 and 2); the filled stars correspond to bands that are cleaved more strongly than the empty star. Cleavage at these sites indicates that nucleosome positioning has been perturbed. The cleavage site corresponding to the distal border of nucleosome II is marked with a filled circle. Locations of nucleosomes I and II in cells grown in glucose are indicated; the box attached to nucleosome I represents the GAL4 binding site. Lane 8 was taken from a different exposure than lanes 5-7 and 9.

J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 222: 133-137Google Scholar) from 10-ml cultures grown to an A600 of 0.6-1.2 by rapid glass bead lysis. Purified DNA was electrophoresed on 1.5% agarose gels containing 40 μg/ml chloroquine diphosphate (Sigma) at 2 V/cm for 18-20 h, transferred to nylon membranes, and hybridized using probes specific for TRP1ARS1 sequences as described above. Gaussian centers of the topoisomer distributions were calculated as described previously (28Morse R.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 222: 133-137Google Scholar), using images scanned on a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager. To determine whether GAL4·ER·VP16 binds to chromatin in vivo in the absence of hormone, we compared transcriptional activation of a UASGAL-lacZ reporter by GAL4 in the presence and absence of the GAL4·ER·VP16 expression vector. β-Galactosidase activity induced by GAL4 (via growth of cells in galactose) was decreased in the presence of GAL4·ER·VP16 (Table I), suggesting that GAL4·ER·VP16 could compete with GAL4 for site occupancy in the absence of hormone. To determine whether GAL4·ER·VP16 could bind to a nucleosomal site in the absence of hormone, we examined its effect on the chromatin structure of TA17Δ80 (10Morse R.H. Science. 1993; 262: 1563-1566Google Scholar). TA17Δ80 is a TRP1ARS1-based plasmid in which a single strong GAL4 binding site has been introduced such that the site is incorporated near the center (i.e. near the pseudodyad) of a positioned nucleosome in cells grown in glucose, conditions under which GAL4 is expressed at extremely low levels (29Griggs D.W. Johnston M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8597-8601Google Scholar). Yeast cells harboring TA17Δ80 were grown in the presence of GAL4·ER·VP16 with and without hormone and in the absence of GAL4·ER·VP16 in glucose (GAL4 nearly absent) and in galactose (GAL4 present in its activating configuration). Nuclei were prepared and treated with micrococcal nuclease (MNase), and the cleavage sites were mapped relative to an EcoRV restriction site (25Nedospasov S.A. Georgiev G.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1980; 92: 532-539Google Scholar, 26Wu C. Nature. 1980; 286: 854-860Google Scholar). Regions of about 150 base pairs that are protected from MNase digestion in chromatin but are cleaved as naked DNA are diagnostic of positioned nucleosomes (30Simpson R.T. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1991; 40: 143-184Google Scholar, 31Thoma F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1130: 1-19Google Scholar); in the case of TA17Δ80 and its progenitor TRP1ARS1, the assignment of positioned nucleosomes I and II (Fig. 1) is also based on a substantial body of earlier work (10Morse R.H. Science. 1993; 262: 1563-1566Google Scholar, 30Simpson R.T. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1991; 40: 143-184Google Scholar, 31Thoma F. Biochim. Biophys.

In galactose medium, GAL4 expression is induced, and MNase cleavage sites are generated in the regions of both nucleosomes I and II, as observed previously (Fig. 1, lanes 3-4; Ref. 10Morse R.H. Science. 1993; 262: 1563-1566Google Scholar). These new cleavages are also seen in naked DNA treated with MNase (10Morse R.H. Science. 1993; 262: 1563-1566Google Scholar) and indicate that GAL4 is binding to its site and perturbing nucleosome positioning. The same cleavage sites are seen, albeit more weakly, when GAL4·ER·VP16 is expressed in cells grown in glucose medium and hormone is not added (Fig. 1, lanes 5-7), indicating that GAL4·ER·VP16 can bind under nonactivating conditions. Interestingly, the addition of 0.1 μMβ-estradiol caused enhanced cleavage in the regions of nucleosomes I and II in TA17Δ80 (compare the relative intensities of cleavage sites marked by stars with the site marked by a filled circle, lanes 5-9), suggesting that binding of GAL4·ER·VP16 was increased or altered by the addition of hormone. These results are consistent with previous findings that binding of GAL4 to TA17Δ80 under activating conditions (in galactose) allowed strong MNase cleavage in the regions of nucleosomes I and II, whereas ectopic expression of GAL4 in glucose, in which it is repressed by GAL80, or expression of the very weakly activating derivative, GAL4(1-147)H, allowed only weak MNase cleavage (10Morse R.H. Science. 1993; 262: 1563-1566Google Scholar). We wondered whether a GAL4 binding site embedded in chromatin in a different context would show a similar effect of an unmasked activation domain, so we examined another yeast episome having a GAL4 binding site in a positioned nucleosome, TALS. The TALS episome is packaged into strongly positioned nucleosomes in yeast α cells by the α2·MCM1 complex in conjunction with SSN6 and TUP1 (Refs. 11Roth S.Y. Dean A. Simpson R.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 2247-2260Google Scholar and 32Cooper J.P. Roth S.Y. Simpson R.T. Genes & Dev. 1994; 8: 1400-1410Google Scholar; see Fig. 2). Nucleosome IV of TALS, immediately adjacent to the α2·MCM1 operator, contains a strong binding site for GAL4, which derives from the GAL3 promoter (12Bajwa W. Torchia T.E. Hopper J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 3439-3447Google Scholar) and is in a region of nucleosome IV inaccessible to Escherichia coli Dam methyltransferase expressed in yeast (33Kladde M.P. Simpson R.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1361-1365Google Scholar). As in TA17Δ80, the GAL4 binding site in this plasmid is removed from its natural context (because the 3′ portion of the GAL3 promoter, including the TATA box, is not present in TALS, and sequences farther than 60 base pairs upstream of the UASGAL do not contribute to GAL3 expression (12Bajwa W. Torchia T.E. Hopper J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 3439-3447Google Scholar)). Nearly the entire TALS plasmid is packaged into strongly positioned nucleosomes in yeast α cells, so we thought it would provide a potentially interesting template to examine the effects of GAL4 binding and activation domain unmasking on chromatin structure. Nuclei from yeast cells harboring TALS were prepared and digested with MNase, and cleavage sites were mapped counterclockwise from the EcoRV site (Fig. 2). Comparison of the digestion patterns of chromatin from cells lacking the GAL4·ER·VP16 expression vector and grown in glucose (lane 9) with naked DNA (lane 11) shows that TALS is packaged into strongly positioned nucleosomes, as observed previously (11Roth S.Y. Dean A. Simpson R.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 2247-2260Google Scholar). (Although the sample in lane 9 is heavily digested, the cleavage sites are identical to those seen in lighter digests (Ref. 11Roth S.Y. Dean A. Simpson R.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 2247-2260Google Scholar and data not shown).) When GAL4·ER·VP16 is expressed, a new cleavage site is generated in the region of nucleosome IV, close to the GAL4 binding site, suggesting that GAL4·ER·VP16 can bind and perturb nucleosome positioning in TALS even in its nonactivating form (Fig. 2, lanes 2-4; see the band marked by an arrowhead, which is absent from lane 9). A parallel culture incubated for 4 hours in the presence of 0.1 μMβ-estradiol showed further changes in chromatin structure (Fig. 2, lanes 5-7); the cleavage indicated by the arrowhead is enhanced relative to the site below it, and a new site is generated in the vicinity of nucleosome III (filled circle). A weak cleavage site is also generated near the center of the region protected by nucleosome IV, which is also cut only weakly in naked DNA (lane 11). GAL4 in galactose perturbs the MNase cleavage pattern of TALS chromatin similarly to GAL4·ER·VP16 in the presence of hormone. GAL4 can also bind to DNA in a nonactivating configuration in the absence of galactose, when its activation domain is masked by the repressor protein GAL80 (34Johnston S.A. Salmeron Jr., J.M. Dincher S.S. Cell. 1987; 50: 143-146Google Scholar, 35Ma J. Ptashne M. Cell. 1987; 50: 137-142Google Scholar). Binding of nonactivating GAL4 in vivo has been detected by dimethyl sulfate footprinting (36Giniger E. Varnum S.M. Ptashne M. Cell. 1985; 40: 767-774Google Scholar), photofootprinting (37Selleck S.B. Majors J. Nature. 1987; 325: 173-177Google Scholar), and perturbation of positioned nucleosomes (10Morse R.H. Science. 1993; 262: 1563-1566Google Scholar). When galactose is present, a conformational change unmasks the GAL4 activation domain (38Leuther K.K. Johnston S.A. Science. 1992; 256: 1333-1335Google Scholar). To determine whether GAL4, like GAL4·ER· VP16, would perturb TALS chromatin differently in its activating and nonactivating configurations, we performed MNase digests of TALS chromatin from cells grown in glucose (GAL4 nearly absent), raffinose (GAL4 present in its nonactivating configuration), and galactose (GAL4 present in its activating configuration). We also analyzed chromatin from cells in which GAL4 was ectopically expressed from the strong ADH1 promoter in glucose. The high levels of GAL4 expressed from the ADH1 promoter titrate GAL80 (35Ma J. Ptashne M. Cell. 1987; 50: 137-142Google Scholar), but most (>75%; data not shown) of the GAL4 molecules are still repressed by GAL80 under these conditions. Fig. 3 shows changes in the MNase cleavage pattern of TALS in galactose compared with glucose (lanes 2 and 3; see bands marked by dots) which are similar to those seen in the presence of ligand-activated GAL4·ER·VP16 compared with in its absence (Fig. 2, compare lanes 5-7 with lane 9; see bands marked by arrowhead and dot). When GAL4 is expressed in its nonactivating configuration by growth of cells in raffinose (Fig. 3, lane 1) or under conditions where activation is weak by ectopic expression in glucose (lanes 6 and 7), the MNase"

Recently, it has been shown that L-CanAg is a novel glycoform of CD43, a surface sialoglycoprotein normally found only on hematopoietic cells. Immunoprecipitation with α-GPEP18, a novel antiserum against the cytoplasmic domain of CD43, detected a transmembrane form of L-CanAg carrying sialyl-Lewis a.

Interestingly, both surface- and phosphate-labeled L-CanAg were eluted earlier from a gel filtration column than their unlabeled counterparts, indicating that this method could separate membrane-bound L-CanAg from its soluble form. Immunoprecipitations of pulse-chase-labeled COLO 205 lysates fractionated by gel filtration showed that decrease in membrane-bound L-CanAg was concomitant with an increase in the intracellular soluble form.

The common denominator of these molecules is the mucin domain, a more or less repetitive sequence rich in proline and serine and/or threonine, the two latter amino acids being extensively O-glycosylated (1Forstner J.F. Forstner G.G. Johnson L.R. Physiology of the Gastrointestinal Tract. 3rd Ed. Raven Press, New York1994: 1255-1283Google Scholar, 2Strous G.J. Dekker J. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1992; 27: 57-92Google Scholar). The high abundance of proline and carbohydrate chains makes the mucin domain a very extended, hydrophilic and protease-resistant structure. Mucins are thought to protect mucosae from chemical, mechanical, and microbial damage by restricting the mobility of water in the vicinity of the apical membrane. Glycoproteins containing mucin domains have also been found in non-epithelial cells such as endothelial cells and leukocytes, where they are involved in both adhesive and anti-adhesive events (3Sánchez-Mateos P.

Using the colon adenocarcinoma cell line COLO 205 as a model system, previous studies have identified two mucin-like glycoproteins called H-CanAg and L-CanAg, which are the major Si-Lea-carrying glycoproteins in these cells (8Baeckström D. Hansson G.C. Nilsson O. Johansson C. Gendler S.J. Lindholm L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21537-21547Google Scholar). H-CanAg, which has an apparent molecular mass of 600-800 kDa, was shown to be a MUC1 mucin, i.e. the apoprotein part of the molecule is the product of the MUC1 gene. MUC1 mucins are transmembrane glycoproteins common to apical membranes of secretory epithelia, and overexpression and/or abnormal glycoforms of MUC1 are often found in carcinomas (9Hilkens J. Ligtenberg M.J.L. Vos H.L. Litvinov S.V. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 359-363Google Scholar). L-CanAg (apparent molecular mass = 150-300 kDa), which is secreted from COLO 205 cells at a significantly higher rate than H-CanAg, was recently shown to have an apoprotein that is identical to that of CD43 (leukosialin) (10Baeckström D. Zhang K. Asker N. Rüetschi U. Ek M. Hansson G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13688-13692Google Scholar), normally a major membrane sialoglycoprotein of leukocytes and platelets (11Fukuda M.

Ligtenberg M.J.L. Vos H.L. Litvinov S.V. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 359-363Google Scholar) that carcinoma cells may gain a selective advantage, such as immune evasion or facilitated dissemination, by the expression of mucin-like glycoproteins, either by overexpressing normally present mucins such as MUC1 or by the anomalous expression of foreign glycoproteins such as CD43. Since the identification of L-CanAg as a CD43 glycoform, expression of CD43 in other non-hematopoietic tumors has also been reported (13Santamaría M. López-Beltrán A. Toro M. Peña J. Molina I.J. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 3526-3529Google Scholar). 2R. Sikut, K. Zhang, D. Baeckström, and G. C. Hansson, manuscript in preparation. When addressing the question of the possible pathological significance of these glycoproteins, knowledge of their metabolism is important. In the present study, I have investigated events in the post-translational modifications of L-CanAg, which are shown to follow a sequence of glycosylation, phosphorylation, and creation of a soluble mucin-like proteolytic fragment which is retained inside the cell and then released into the medium. The colon adenocarcinoma cell line COLO 205 and the promyelocytic cell line HL-60 were cultured as described previously (10Baeckström D. Zhang K. Asker N. Rüetschi U. Ek M. Hansson G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13688-13692Google Scholar). The Si-Lea-reactive mAbs C241 (IgG1) and C50 IgM were gifts generously provided by CanAg Diagnostics AB, Göteborg, Sweden. The mAb Leu-22, which recognizes leukocyte glycoforms of CD43, was purchased from Becton Dickinson, San José, CA. The peptide GPEP18 (CGRRKSRQGSLAMEELKS), corresponding to amino acids 327-344 in the CD43 peptide sequence (except for the N-terminal cysteine) was synthesized and coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin by Scandinavian Peptide Synthesis, Köping, Sweden. The conjugated peptide was used to generate the antiserum α-GPEP18 by immunizing a New Zealand White rabbit as described earlier (14Hansson G.C. Baeckström D. Carlstedt I. Klinga-Levan K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 198: 181-190Google Scholar). COLO 205 cells grown to approximately 75% confluence in 35-mm Petri dishes or 5 × 106HL-60 cells were used in each experiment. For methionine incorporation experiments, cells were starved for 1 h in minimal essential medium without methionine (Life Technologies, Paisley, Scotland) containing 5% fetal calf serum and 2 mM glutamine before labeling with Pro-Mix (Amersham, United Kingdom) corresponding to 150 μCi of [35S]methionine per dish. In pulse-chase experiments, chase was initiated by changing the medium to regular culture medium (see above). For phosphate labeling experiments, cells were starved for 1 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without phosphate (Life Technologies) containing 5% fetal calf serum and 25 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, before labeling with 200 μCi of [32P]orthophosphate (Amersham) per dish. Cells were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline before being lysed in 1 ml of the lysis buffer described in Ref. 10Baeckström D. Zhang K. Asker N. Rüetschi U. Ek M. Hansson G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13688-13692Google Scholar. In phosphate labeling experiments, the lysis buffer was supplemented with 10 mM sodium fluoride. Before surface biotinylation, COLO 205 cells were detached from the substratum using 0.02% EDTA in phosphate-buffered saline. Biotinylation with sulfosuccinimidoyl 6-(biotinamido)hexanoate (NHS-LC-biotin, Pierce, Oud Beijerland, Netherlands) was performed as described by Litvinov and Hilkens (15Litvinov S.V. Hilkens J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21364-21371Google Scholar). Biotinylation of cell-surface glycoconjugates using sodium metaperiodate oxidation followed by treatment with biotin hydrazide (Sigma) was performed according to Orr (16Orr G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 761-766Google Scholar) with the following modifications: the concentration of sodium metaperiodate was 5 mM, biotin hydrazide rather than 2-iminobiotin hydrazide was used at a concentration of 5 mM, and the biotinylation was performed overnight on ice. Biotinylated cells were lysed as described (10Baeckström D. Zhang K. Asker N. Rüetschi U. Ek M. Hansson G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13688-13692Google Scholar). Gel filtration was performed in a Superose 6 HR 10/30 column (Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden) using 0.1 M ammonium acetate or 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 4 M guanidinium chloride as eluant at a flow rate of 0.25 ml/min. Immunoprecipitations were performed as described (10Baeckström D. Zhang K. Asker N. Rüetschi U. Ek M. Hansson G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13688-13692Google Scholar). Eluates from gel filtration were immunoprecipitated afer addition of 0.25 volumes of a 5 × lysis buffer concentrate (lysis buffer, see Ref. 10Baeckström D. Zhang K. Asker N. Rüetschi U. Ek M. Hansson G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13688-13692Google Scholar). Eluted immunoprecipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE with 2.75-15% gradient separation gels and 2.75% stacking gels. Radiolabeled immunoprecipitates were visualized by autoradiography of dried gels after fixation in 30% ethanol, 10% acetic acid for ≥3 h followed by 30 min treatment with Amplify solution (Amersham) containing 5% glycerol. Biotinylated and unlabeled samples were transferred from SDS-PAGE to nitrocellulose (Sartorius, Göttingen, Germany) using a semi-dry Sartoblot cell (Sartorius) and a transfer buffer consisting of 48 mM Tris, 39 mM glycin, 1.3 mM SDS, and 20% (v/v) methanol. Transfer was performed at 2-4 mA/cm2of membrane for 1-2 h. Membranes were subsequently rinsed with water and blocked with 50 mM Tris-HCl, 0.15 M NaCl, pH 7.5 (TBS), containing 3% bovine serum albumin overnight at room temperature. The membrane was incubated with primary antibody diluted to 1-2 μg/ml in TBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 (TBST) for 4 h. After 3 washes with TBST, the membrane was incubated for 3 h with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse antiserum (DAKO immunoglobulins, Glostrup, Denmark) diluted 1/2000 in TBST, or with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated streptavidin diluted in TBST containing 0.5 M NaCl. After 3 washes with TBST and one wash with TBS, the membrane was developed using 0.3 mg/ml nitro blue tetrazolium and 0.15 mg/ml 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate in 0.1 M Tris-HCl, pH 9.5, 0.1 M NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2. Rabbits were immunized with a keyhole limpet hemocyanin-conjugate of GPEP18, a 17-mer peptide identical in sequence to amino acids 327-344 in the cytoplasmic domain of CD43. The resulting antiserum, called α-GPEP18, was tested for reactivity in immunoprecipitation experiments with lysates of pulse-chase labeled cells. In the promyelocytic cell line HL-60, known to express one of the major leukocyte-associated glycoforms of CD43 (17Carlsson S.R. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 12779-12786Google Scholar), α-GPEP18 immunoprecipitated one band of apparent molecular mass of 55 kDa immediately after the pulse labeling (Fig. 1). After 20 and 60 min of chase, another band of 120 kDa gained in intensity concomitant with the fading of the 55-kDa band. The apparent molecular sizes and pulse-chase kinetics of the 55-kDa and 120-kDa bands were in agreement with those reported for the CD43 primary precursor and fully glycosylated forms, respectively (17Carlsson S.R. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 12779-12786Google Scholar). In the colon adenocarcinoma cell line COLO 205, α-GPEP18 immunoprecipitated a precursor band with the same electrophoretic mobility as in HL-60 cells. However, in contrast to the sharp 120-kDa band seen in HL-60 cells, the glycosylated CD43 in COLO 205 appeared as a broad and diffuse smear straddling the 200-kDa marker position. This electrophoretic mobility is typical for that of L-CanAg, the Si-Lea-carrying mucin-like molecule which has been biochemically purified from COLO 205 cells (8Baeckström D. Hansson G.C. Nilsson O. Johansson C. Gendler S.J. Lindholm L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21537-21547Google Scholar) and subsequently shown to be a novel CD43 glycoform (10Baeckström D. Zhang K. Asker N. Rüetschi U. Ek M. Hansson G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13688-13692Google Scholar). It could therefore be concluded that α-GPEP18 can be used as a reagent for glycosylation-independent detection of transmembrane CD43. CD43 glycosylated with Si-Leacan be recovered from secretions of COLO 205 cells in the form of the L-CanAg glycoprotein (10Baeckström D. Zhang K. Asker N. Rüetschi U. Ek M. Hansson G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13688-13692Google Scholar). As the secretion of L-CanAg most likely entails the proteolytic detachment of the CD43 extracellular domain (or a part of it), it was of interest to determine whether L-CanAg is still a transmembrane CD43 molecule at the late biosynthetic stage when formation of the Si-Leaepitope occurs. Lysates and media of COLO 205 cells were therefore immunoprecipitated either with the α-GPEP18 antiserum or the mAb C241 directed against the Si-Leaepitope. The immunoprecipitates were then subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot followed by probing with the mAb C50 which also recognizes Si-Lea. As can be seen in Fig. 2, α-GPEP18 precipitated a Si-Lea-containing band in the L-CanAg size range from COLO 205 cell lysate but not from spent medium. In contrast, L-CanAg and also the Si-Lea-carrying MUC1 mucin H-CanAg were found in COLO 205 cell lysates when immunoprecipitated with the anti-Si-LeamAb C241. Spent medium immunoprecipitated with mAb C241 contained both L-CanAg and traces of H-CanAg (barely visible in Fig. 2); materials of lower apparent Mr than is usually seen for L-CanAg were also detected. These results show that CD43 in COLO 205 cells acquires the Si-Leaepitope before the putative cleavage event that generates secreted L-CanAg. The results also confirm the absence of the CD43 cytoplasmic domain in secreted L-CanAg. To investigate whether membrane-bound L-CanAg only exists as an intracellular intermediate or if it is also exposed at the plasma membrane, surface-bound carbohydrates on COLO 205 cells were labeled by mild periodate oxidation followed by derivatization of generated aldehyde groups with biotin hydrazide. Lysates of the labeled cells were immunoprecipitated with the α-GPEP18 antiserum or with mAb C241. After SDS-PAGE and Western blot, biotinylated immunoprecipitates were detected with alkaline phosphatase-labeled streptavidin. As shown in Fig. 3A, immunoprecipitation with α-GPEP18 yielded a readily distinguishable band in the L-CanAg size range, indicating that at least some of the membrane-bound CD43 in this cell line is present at the plasma membrane. In contrast, the Si-Lea-reactive mAb C241 could not immunoprecipitate any detectable amount of biotinylated L-CanAg. This latter finding suggested that the periodate oxidation-biotinylation procedure had rendered all the cell surface-exposed Si-Leaepitopes unrecognizable to the C241 mAb. Periodate oxidation of Si-Leais known to reduce the binding of C241 (18Johansson C. Nilsson O. Baeckström D. Jansson E.-L. Lindholm L. Tumor Biol. 1991; 12: 159-170Google Scholar), an effect which apparently was enhanced by the biotinylation of oxidized moieties. This phenomenon was exploited in an attempt to establish whether or not all the mature CD43 in COLO 205 cells is found on the cell surface. Lysates of biotinylated and non-biotinylated cells were immunoprecipitated with the C241 mAb and detected with C50, another mAb against Si-Lea, after SDS-PAGE and Western blot. As shown in Fig. 3B, L-CanAg (and also H-CanAg) are readily detected in untreated cells as well as in oxidized-biotinylated cells. Taken together, the data in Fig. 3, A and B, indicate that a significant proportion of the CD43 present in COLO 205 cells is inaccessible to inactivation of their Si-Leaepitopes by oxidation-biotinylation and therefore most likely represent a pool of intracellularly stored CD43. Oxidation-biotinylation was also performed with HL-60 cells. As in COLO 205 cells, immunoprecipitation with α-GPEP18 yielded a biotinylated band of the size expected for glycosylated CD43 (Fig. 3A). When whole cell lysates of untreated and oxidized-biotinylated HL-60 cells were compared in a Western blot probed with the glycosylation-dependent anti-CD43 mAb Leu-22, only the untreated cells showed reactivity (Fig. 3C). As the Leu-22 epitope is known to be sensitive to periodate oxidation, the complete disappearance of Leu-22-reactive CD43 in oxidized-biotinylated HL-60 cells indicates that the majority of CD43 in this cell line is present on the plasma membrane, in contrast to the situation in COLO 205 cells. As CD43 is known to be a phosphoprotein in leukocytes (19Piller V. Piller F. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18824-18831Google Scholar), it was of interest to determine whether phosphorylated CD43 could be detected also in COLO 205 cells. COLO 205 and HL-60 cells were therefore metabolically labeled with [32P]orthophosphate and the lysates were immunoprecipitated with the α-GPEP18 antiserum and, in the case of COLO 205, also with mAb C241. As shown in Fig. 4A, phosphorylated L-CanAg could be detected in immunoprecipitations both with α-GPEP18 and mAb C241. The intensity of the staining was comparable to that obtained in the control immunoprecipitation of HL-60 cells with α-GPEP18. As a parallel immunopreciptation of [35S]methionine-labeled cells with α-GPEP18 indicated that the CD43 synthesis rates were similar in COLO 205 and HL-60 (Fig. 4B), it can be assumed that the degree of CD43 phosphorylation in COLO 205 is roughly comparable to that seen in HL-60. As the GPEP18 peptide contains the putative main phosphorylation site (Ser-332) of leukocyte CD43 (19Piller V. Piller F. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18824-18831Google Scholar), it could be suspected that phosphorylation at this site might influence the reactivity of the α-GPEP18 antiserum. To test this hypothesis, lysates of [32P]orthophosphate-labeled COLO 205 and HL-60 cells were repeatedly immunoprecipitated with α-GPEP18. After the depletion of α-GPEP18-reactive CD43, the remaining CD43 was precipitated using mAb C241 (for COLO 205 lysates) or mAb Leu-22 (for HL-60 lysates). Fig. 4, C and D, shows that both in COLO 205 and HL-60 cells, a significant amount of phosphorylated CD43 could be recovered from the lysates after depletion with α-GPEP18. These results show that all phosphorylated (and thus transmembrane) CD43 is not recognized by α-GPEP18. To characterize the size distribution of cell surface-bound Si-Lea-carrying glycoproteins, COLO 205 cells were surface-labeled with NHS-LC-biotin, a reagent that couples biotin to amino groups of polypeptide chains on the cell surface and thus does not modify carbohydrate structures like Si-Lea. A lysate of the labeled cells was separated by gel filtration on a Superose 6 column using 4 M guanidinium chloride as eluant. The fractions were analyzed with immunofluorometric assays which used the Si-Lea-reactive mAb C50 as solid phase-bound catching antibody and either C50 or streptavidin as europium-labeled tracer. The chromatogram obtained with the homologous C50/Eu-C50 assay (Fig. 5) showed the characteristic biphasic distribution of Si-Lea-carrying glycoproteins observed previously in COLO 205 (8Baeckström D. Hansson G.C. Nilsson O. Johansson C. Gendler S.J. Lindholm L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21537-21547Google Scholar). The early eluting peak, called the E peak, is known to contain the MUC1 mucin H-CanAg, whereas the late eluting L peak has biochemical properties closely similar to those of the secreted CD43 glycoform L-CanAg isolated from spent COLO 205 medium (8Baeckström D. Hansson G.C. Nilsson O. Johansson C. Gendler S.J. Lindholm L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21537-21547Google Scholar). The curve obtained with the C50/Eu-streptavidin assay showed a markedly different shape (Fig. 5) with the main peak appearing at a position between the E and L peaks. The low C50/Eu-streptavidin reactivity at the position of the L peak suggested that the L peak consists of predominantly intracellular (and thus non-biotinylated) material. This raised the question whether the main C50/Eu-streptavidin-reactive peak represented the position at which transmembrane L-CanAg elutes in gel filtration. To adress that question, fractions from Superose 6 gel filtration of a COLO 205 lysate were combined into pools E1, E2, and L as shown in Fig. 6A and subjected to immunoprecipitation with the α-GPEP18 antiserum. The immunoprecipitates were then probed on a Western blot with the anti-Si-LeamAb C50. As shown in Fig. 6B, only the E1 and E2 pools showed detectable amounts of α-GPEP18-reactive L-CanAg, suggesting that the L pool does not contain transmembrane L-CanAg. To further test this conclusion, the distribution of phosphorylated (and thus transmembrane) L-CanAg in gel filtration was also analyzed. A lysate of [32P]orthophosphate-labeled COLO 205 cells was subjected to Superose 6 gel filtration and the E1, E2, and L pools were collected and immunoprecipitated with the Si-Lea-reactive mAb C241. As shown in Fig. 6C, the majority of the phosphorylated L-CanAg was found in the E2 pool with only weak staining in the E1 and L pools. This result strengthens the conclusion that the L peak represents an intracellular supply of soluble L-CanAg that can be separated from its membrane-bound counterpart by means of gel filtration. The capacity of gel filtration to separate membrane-bound and soluble L-CanAg was exploited to analyze the sequence of biosynthetic events leading to L-CanAg secretion. Si-Lea-carrying glycoproteins from lysates of pulse-chase labeled COLO 205 cells were subjected to Superose 6 gel filtration and collected in pools E and L (cf. Fig. 6A; pool E = pool E1 + pool E2). These pools, as well as the spent media obtained from the pulse-chase experiment, were subjected to immunoprecipitation with mAb C241. As can be seen in Fig. 7, the appearance and disappearance of labeled L-CanAg in the E and L pools followed distinctly different time courses. In the E pool, the L-CanAg staining was most intense after 1 h with slight fading after 2 h and significant fading after 5 h. In contrast, the L-CanAg staining in the L pool increased steadily up to 5 h. After 24 h, most of the staining in both the E and L pools had disappeared, concomitant with a significant increase in L-CanAg staining in the spent medium (data not shown). As the immunoprecipitation was performed using a Si-Lea-reactive mAb, the kinetics of the Si-Lea-carrying MUC1 mucin H-CanAg appearing in the E pool could also be followed. In striking contrast to the kinetics of membrane-bound (i.e. pool E) L-CanAg, labeled H-CanAg was virtually absent after 1 h, maximal at 5 h, and still showing residual staining after 24 h. In a recent study (10Baeckström D. Zhang K. Asker N. Rüetschi U. Ek M. Hansson G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13688-13692Google Scholar) it was demonstrated that the colon adenocarcinoma cell line COLO 205 expresses CD43, a surface molecule normally only seen on cells of the hematopoietic lineage. The CD43 glycoform expressed in COLO 205 cells, L-CanAg, was originally isolated as a secreted mucin-like molecule carrying Si-Lea, a marker for carcinomas of the intestinal tract (8Baeckström D. Hansson G.C. Nilsson O. Johansson C. Gendler S.J. Lindholm L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21537-21547Google Scholar). The glycans of L-CanAg are strikingly different from those of leukocyte CD43: whereas the latter generally contain only 4-6 sugars per chain (11Fukuda M. Glycobiology. 1991; 1: 347-356Google Scholar), the former contain 17 on the average (8Baeckström D. Hansson G.C. Nilsson O. Johansson C. Gendler S.J. Lindholm L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21537-21547Google Scholar). It is therefore no surprise that antibodies that bind the extracellular domain of leukocyte CD43 fail to recognize L-CanAg (10Baeckström D. Zhang K. Asker N. Rüetschi U. Ek M. Hansson G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13688-13692Google Scholar).2To facilitate detection of CD43 in a glycosylation-independent manner, an antiserum was raised against the synthetic peptide GPEP18 corresponding to a part of the cytoplasmic domain of CD43. This antiserum, α-GPEP18, was indeed capable of detecting both leukocyte-type CD43 from the promyelocytic cell line HL-60 and L-CanAg from COLO 205 cells (Fig. 1). The data presented in Fig. 1, Fig. 2 also show that α-GPEP18 can immunoprecipitate CD43 molecules from COLO 205 cells that have acquired a high (150-250 kDa) and polydisperse apparent molecular mass as well as the Si-Leaepitope, i.e. features typical of the mature L-CanAg mucin. The secretion of L-CanAg almost certainly entails the proteolytic detachment of the extracellular region from the transmembrane and intracellular domains, as confirmed by the inability of α-GPEP18 to immunoprecipitate any Si-Lea-containing materials from COLO 205 culture supernatant, and on the basis of the data from Fig. 1, Fig. 2, it can be assumed that this cleavage occurs at a late biosynthetic stage when most or all of the glycosylation has taken place. The demonstration of co-expression of Si-Leawith CD43 peptide epitopes (Fig. 2) also provides additional evidence that L-CanAg is indeed a CD43 glycoform. The post-translational modifications of L-CanAg also include phosphorylation, as demonstrated by the metabolic phosphate labeling experiments (Fig. 4). Leukocytes and cell lines derived from hematopoietic cells also phosphorylate CD43 to varying extents (19Piller V. Piller F. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18824-18831Google Scholar, 20Axelsson B. Perlmann P. Scand. J. Immunol. 1989; 30: 539-547Google Scholar). The degree of CD43 phosphorylation in COLO 205 cells seemed roughly comparable to that in HL-60, which in turn phosphorylates CD43 to relatively high extent compared with other leukocyte cell lines and to peripheral blood lymphocytes (19Piller V. Piller F. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18824-18831Google Scholar). The significance of CD43 phosphorylation is not known, but it may control proteolytic cleavage of the CD43 extracellular domain as both phosphorylation and proteolysis occur upon activation of leukocytes (21Bazil V. Strominger J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3792-3796Google Scholar, 22Silverman L.B. Wong R.C.K. Remold-O'Donnell E. Vercelli D. Sancho J. Terhorst C. Rosen F. Geha R. Chatila T. J. Immunol. 1989; 142: 4194-4200Google Scholar, 23Wong R.C.K. Remold-O'Donnell E. Vercelli D. Sancho J. Terhorst C. Rosen F. Geha R. Chatila T. J. Immunol. 1990; 144: 1455-1460Google Scholar, 24Rieu P. Porteu F. Bessou G. Lesavre P. Halbwachs-Mecarelli L. Eur. J. Immunol. 1992; 22: 3021-3026Google Scholar). The finding that L-CanAg is phosphorylated as well as proteolytically cleaved at a high rate in COLO 205 cells strengthens the hypothesis that there may be a causal relationship between phosphorylation and proteolysis of CD43. One might also speculate that the extensive phosphorylation and proteolysis of L-CanAg are the results of the activated state of these carcinoma cells, which could mimic the situation in activated leukocytes. As was shown by the sequential immunoprecipitation experiments, α-GPEP18 failed to bind a significant subpopulation of phosphorylated CD43 in both COLO 205 and HL-60 cells. Phosphorylation itself is probably the cause of α-GPEP18's inability to bind this subpopulation, as treatment of HL-60 lysates with alkaline phosphatase has been observed 3J. Haraldsson and S. R. Carlsson, personal communication. to increase the amount of CD43 recoverable by α-GPEP18. The heterogeneity in α-GPEP18 reactivity toward phosphorylated CD43 suggests that several different phosphorylation sites may be used to a significant degree in COLO 205 and HL-60; alternatively, phosphorylation at a single site may cause the surrounding region to assume a number of alternative conformations, some of which are unrecognizable to the antiserum. Although the cell-surface biotinylation experiments clearly demonstrated that membrane-bound L-CanAg is present at the plasma membrane (Fig. 3A), they also indicated that there is a significant amount of L-CanAg that is stored inside the COLO 205 cells, as shown by the presence of a pool of molecules that are protected from the Si-Leainactivation caused by periodate oxidation and biotinylation (Fig. 3B). This was in contrast to the situation in HL-60 cells, where no detectable amount of the Leu-22 epitope remained after oxidation-biotinylation. This difference may be explained by the respective origins of COLO 205 and HL-60 cells: whereas HL-60 is of the hematopoietic cell lineage, COLO 205 is derived from the intestinal epithelium. One class of intestinal epithelial cells, the goblet cells, are known to be capable of storing mucins in intacellular granules from which they can be released by a process of regulated secretion (1Forstner J.F. Forstner G.G. Johnson L.R. Physiology of the Gastrointestinal Tract. 3rd Ed. Raven Press, New York1994: 1255-1283Google Scholar). It is therefore possible that COLO 205 cells treat L-CanAg as if it were an intestinal mucin, not only with respect to glycosylation but also with respect to intracellular trafficking. The almost exclusive localization of CD43 to the surface of the hematopoietic cells has been observed before (17Carlsson S.R. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 12779-12786Google Scholar). The finding that membrane-bound and soluble L-CanAg could be separated from each other by gel filtration (Fig. 5, Fig. 6) is quite surprising, as removal of the intracellular and transmembrane domains of L-CanAg would decrease its size by only around 10%. One might speculate that membrane-bound L-CanAg forms noncovalently bound oligomers which are dissociated upon release of the extracellular domain. As the experiment described in Fig. 6, A and B, gives similar results when conducted in the presence of the denaturing solvent 4 M guanidinium chloride (data not shown), such hypothetical oligomers would have to be held together with considerable strength (although being sensitive to SDS). By separating Si-Lea-carrying glycoproteins from lysates of pulse-chase labeled COLO 205 cells by gel filtration, the kinetics of membrane-bound and soluble L-CanAg could be studied (Fig. 7). From the finding that membrane-bound L-CanAg appeared and disappeared more rapidly than the soluble form, two conclusions may be drawn. First, it shows that the soluble L-CanAg detected in lysates in this and previous experiments is not an artifact created during lysate preparation (this is also indicated by the difference between membrane-bound and soluble L-CanAg in accessibility to surface biotinylation (Fig. 5)). Second, this result indicates that the relatively rapid synthesis of fully glycosylated, membrane-bound L-CanAg (1-2 h) is followed by a slower process involving the conversion to the soluble form, which is retained inside the cell until more than 5 h after synthesis. It is conceivable that membrane-bound L-CanAg cycles between the surface and the interior of the cell in a manner similar to what has been demonstrated earlier for the MUC1 mucin (15Litvinov S.V. Hilkens J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21364-21371Google Scholar). However, experiments aimed at elucidating this question have been inconclusive (data not shown). In summary, the results presented here suggest the following pathway for the modification and transport of the CD43 anomalously expressed in COLO 205 cells. The primary translation product, following a process of extensive glycosylation (including synthesis of the Si-Leaepitope), is transported to the cell surface where a proportion of the molecules are phosphorylated. Transmembrane L-CanAg is then converted to a soluble form by proteolysis. As a significant amount of soluble L-CanAg is found inside the cells, this proteolytic step presumably follows upon endocytosis of the cell surface-bound molecule. The soluble form of L-CanAg is then stored inside the cell for some time before being secreted. During this storage additional glycosylation may take place, as L-CanAg from COLO 205 cell extracts and from spent medium differ somewhat in carbohydrate composition (8Baeckström D. Hansson G.C. Nilsson O. Johansson C. Gendler S.J. Lindholm L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21537-21547Google Scholar). The present conclusions thus underscore the complexity of mucin expression in carcinomas and illustrate how a single mucin apoprotein species may assume a variety of different biochemical forms with a rich potential for distinct biological functions.

To study the role of phosphorylation in CD45, in vivo phosphorylation sites of CD45 from 70Z/3.12 cells were identified using 32P labeling, trypsin digestion, two-dimensional peptide mapping, high performance liquid chromatography, phosphoamino acid analysis, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry, and specific enzymatic degradation. Eight phosphopeptides, a through h, were isolated and four phosphorylation sites were identified. All four phosphorylation sites were in the membrane-distal PTPase domain (D2) and the C-terminal tail and none were in the membrane-proximal PTPase domain (D1). One site, Ser(P)939 peptide h, was in the D2 domain and, by comparison to the three-dimensional structure of PTP1B, is predicted to lie at the apex of the substrate binding loop. Ser939 was the only in vitro phosphorylation site for protein kinase C among the phosphorylation sites identified. Four of the C-terminal peptides identified (d, e, f, and g) spanned the same sequence and were derived from the same phosphorylation site in the C-terminal tail, Ser1204.

CD45 (T200, B220, L-CA) is a transmembrane PTPase of hematopoietic cells of 1268 total amino acids, with a cytoplasmic domain of 702 amino acids containing tandem repeated PTPase homology domains (designated D1 and D2). The membrane-proximal PTPase domain (D1) is considered to be constitutively active, and the second PTPase domain (D2) is usually considered to be inactive. CD45 has been intensely studied because of its well documented role in the antigen-specific activation of B and T cells (1Trowbridge I.S. Thomas M.L. Annu. Rev.

Cambier J.C. Science. 1991; 252: 1839-1842Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). It is believed that CD45 activates the Src family PTKs by dephosphorylating the regulatory Tyr(P) near the C terminus of T cell receptor or B cell receptor-associated Src family kinases (12Ostergaard H.L.

Since CD45 is abundantly expressed on all nonerythroid hematopoietic cells, it has also been hypothesized that CD45 may be involved in the regulation of other fundamental cell processes such as cell growth and cell cycle (1Trowbridge I.S.

Phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic domain of CD45 has been described, and this phosphorylation has been proposed to play a role in the regulation of biological function by providing docking sites (18Autero M. Saharinen J. Pessa-Morikawa T. Soula-Rothhut M. Oetken C. Gassmann M. Bergman M. Alitalo K. Burn P. Gahmberg C.G. Mustelin T. Mol. Cell.

Science. 1991; 253: 1423-1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The modulation of CD45 PTPase activity has been found to correlate with phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic domain in several studies. 1) Treatment of T cell clones with a Ca2+ ionophore decreased the Ser phosphorylation of CD45 and simultaneously decreased the PTPase activity of the molecule (20Ostergaard H.L. Trowbridge I.S. Science. 1991; 253: 1423-1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). 2) Phosphorylation of human CD45 (by overexpression of CD45 in Cos cells with p50csk PTK) increased the PTPase activity of CD45 and increased the association of CD45 with a putative substrate, p56lck (18Autero M. Saharinen J. Pessa-Morikawa T. Soula-Rothhut M. Oetken C. Gassmann M. Bergman M. Alitalo K. Burn P. Gahmberg C.G. Mustelin T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1308-1321Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The p50csk PTK phosphorylation site was identified as Tyr1193. 3) The sequential in vitro phosphorylation of human CD45 by Abl PTK and casein kinase II increased the activity of CD45 for certain substrates (19Stover D.R. Walsh K.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5523-5532Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). 4) The increase in CD45 phosphorylation due to phorbol ester treatment of cells was associated with a decrease in PTPase activity (21Yamada A. Streuli M. Saito H. Rothstein D.M. Schlossman S.F. Morimoto C. Eur. J. Immunol. 1990; 20: 1655-1660Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Other reports indicate that the phosphorylation of CD45 increased after stimulation by phorbol esters (22Autero M. Gahmberg C.G. Eur. J. Immunol. 1987; 17: 1503-1506Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) or interleukin-2 (23Valentine M.A. Widmer M.B. Ledbetter J.A. Pinault F. Voice R. Clark E.A. Gallis B. Brautigan D.L. Eur. J. Immunol. 1991; 21: 913-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) without apparent change in CD45 activity. The elucidation of the role of CD45 phosphorylation in PTPase activity and in signaling has been hampered by the lack of precise knowledge of naturally occurring CD45 phosphorylation sites. The large number of potential phosphorylation sites in the CD45 cytoplasmic domain make identification by sequencing or mutagenesis extremely difficult. To resolve this problem, we have identified the in vivo phosphorylation sites of CD45 in 70Z/3.12 cells (a mouse pre-B cell line) by two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping, reverse-phase HPLC, phosphoamino acid analysis, enzymatic degradation, and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS). The mouse pre-B lymphocyte cell line 70Z/3.12 was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and grown at 37°C in 90% RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 10% heat inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Life Technologies), 25 mM HEPES, 50 μM 2-mercaptoethanol, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 units/ml streptomycin (complete RPMI 1640 medium) in 5% CO2. Cells were counted using a Coulter Cell Counter (Coulter Electronics, Hialeah, FL) and maintained in an exponential growth state (0.1-4.0 × 105 cells/ml). Cultures were harvested at 8 × 105 cells/ml with viability in excess of 97%. 70Z/3.12 cells (1 × 107) were washed three times with phosphate-free RPMI 1640 medium (supplemented to 10% with dialyzed FBS; Life Technologies), then resuspended in 1 ml of phosphate-free RPMI 1640 medium, followed by incubation for 1 h at 37°C. After centrifugation, cells were resuspended in 1 ml of fresh, phosphate-free RPMI 1640 medium. One mCi of [32P]orthophosphate (DuPont NEN Research, Boston, MA) was added and cells were incubated for 4 h at 37°C. 70Z/3.12 cells were pelleted, washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (8 mM Na2HPO4, 1 mM KH2PO4, 137 mM NaCl, 3 mM KCl, pH 7.4), and then lysed (2 × 107 cells/ml lysis buffer) in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer containing 20 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 137 mM NaCl, 1.0% (v/v) Nonidet P-40 (Pierce), 2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.3 μM aprotinin, 1 μM leupeptin, 5 mM EDTA, 1 μM pepstatin A, 50 μg/ml DNase I and RNase A, 1 μM okadaic acid (Life Technologies, Inc.), and 6 mM NaF for 30 min in ice. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm at 4°C for 20 min and precleared with 25 μl of packed Gammabind Plus Sepharose (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). Anti-CD45 M1/9.3.4 monoclonal antibody (2 μg, ATCC) was conjugated to 25 μl of Gammabind Plus Sepharose for 1 h at 4°C in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4), followed by incubation with 0.5 ml of cell lysate (from 107 cells) for 1 h at 4°C under constant shaking. For SDS-PAGE, immunoprecipitates were washed once with Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer, twice with phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4, containing 1 μM okadaic acid, 6 mM NaF), once with 0.5 M LiCl (pH 7.4, containing 1 μM okadaic acid, 6 mM NaF), and twice with 50 mM Tris buffer (pH 8.0, containing 1 μM okadaic acid, 6 mM NaF). Immunoprecipitates were suspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer and boiled for 3 min. CD45 immunoprecipitate samples were subjected to electrophoresis on 4-15% SDS-PAGE gels for 1.5 h at 120 V. Silver staining was performed to determine the amount of CD45 proteins. CD45 bands were quantitated by optical scanning using an Ambis scanner (Ambis, Inc., San Diego, CA). For 32P-labeled samples, CD45 proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane (0.2 μm) (Bio-Rad) by electroblotting in 25 mM Tris, 192 mM glycine, 20% (v/v) methanol, pH 8.3, for 4 h at 400 mA. CD45 bands were visualized by autoradiography. 32P-Labeled CD45 bands from the PVDF membrane were excised, washed three times with methanol, blocked in 1 ml of 0.5% PVP-360 (Sigma) in 100 mM acetic acid for 30 min at 37°C, and washed five times with water. Tryptic digestion was performed with 10 μg of trypsin (sequencing grade) (Promega, Madison, WI) for 2 h in 200 μl of 50 mM NH4HCO3, pH 8.3, at 37°C, and an additional 10 μg of trypsin was added and incubated for another 2 h at 37°C. Tryptic peptides were recovered in the supernatant and concentrated in a SpeedVac (Savant Instruments, Inc., Farmingdale, NY). The samples were separated by thin layer electrophoresis (TLE) on 20 × 20-cm Kodak cellulose thin layer chromatography (TLC) plates (Eastman Kodak Co.) in the first dimension in pH 1.9 buffer (formic acid (88% w/v)/glacial acetic acid/water, 25:78:897, v/v/v) at 0°C at 1000 V for 30 min, dried in air, and separated in the second dimension in chromatography buffer (n-butanol/pyridine/glacial acetic acid/water, 15:10:3:12, v/v/v/v) (24van der Geer P. Luo K. Sefton B.W. Hunter T. Celis J.E. Cell Biology: A Laboratory Handbook. Vol. 3. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1994: 422-447Crossref Google Scholar, 25Hunter T. Sefton B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 1311-1315Crossref PubMed Scopus (1535) Google Scholar). The phosphopeptides were visualized by using a Betascope 603 blot analyzer (Betagen, Waltham, MA). 32P-Labeled tryptic phosphopeptides eluted from TLC plates or collected from reverse-phase HPLC were hydrolyzed in 100 μl of 5.7 N HCl for 1 h at 100°C. The recovered phosphoamino acids were dried in a SpeedVac. Unlabeled phosphoamino acids were added to each sample as standard markers. The samples were analyzed by one-dimensional electrophoresis in pH 2.5 buffer (66.7% pH 3.5 buffer (glacial acetic acid/pyridine/water, 50:5:945, v/v/v, containing 0.5 mM EDTA) and 33.3% pH 1.9 buffer (glacial acetic acid/88% formic acid/water, 78:25:897, v/v/v)) on 20 × 20-cm cellulose TLC plates (Kodak) for 1 h at 0°C and 500 V. The markers were visualized by ninhydrin and the 32P-labeled phosphoamino acids were visualized by Betascope (Betagen) analysis. 70Z/3.12 cells (5 × 109 at 8 × 105 cells/ml) were collected, lysed, and immunoprecipitated with anti-CD45 M1/9.3.4 monoclonal antibody to yield approximately 40 μg of CD45 protein. This large scale, unlabeled CD45 immunoprecipitate was then mixed with a smaller amount of a radioactive marker consisting of 32P-labeled CD45 immunoprecipitate from cells grown at the same density as described above. After SDS-PAGE, Western transfer, and tryptic digestion, the digested mixture was fractionated using a microbore reverse-phase HPLC system (Michrom BioResources, Inc.) with a 0-86% gradient of acetonitrile in 0.1% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid and a flow rate of 50 μl/min on a Reliasil C18 column (5 mm, 300 A, 1.0 × 150 mm, Michrom BioResources). The solvent gradient started at 0% solvent B, then increased to 20% solvent B at 15 min, 60% solvent B at 20 min, and 95% solvent B at 21 min, where solvent A was 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water and solvent B was a mixture of acetonitrile/0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water (9:1). The eluant was monitored by a UV absorbance at 214 nm, and fractions were collected every 30 s. A 1-μl sample of each HPLC fraction was spotted on a TLC plate, followed by detection of 32P radioactivity by Betascope (Betagen) analysis. All MALDI-MS spectra were obtained on a Voyager Elite time-of-flight mass spectrometer (PerSeptive Biosystems, Framingham, MA), used in linear mode, equipped with a nitrogen laser (337 nm, 3-ns pulse). The accelerating voltage in the ion source was 26 kV. Data were acquired with a transient recorder with 2-ns resolution. The matrix used in this work was α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid, dissolved in water/acetonitrile (1:1, v/v) to give a saturated solution at room temperature. To prepare the sample for analysis, 1 μl of the peptide solution (1-10 pmol/μl 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) was added to 1 μl of the matrix solution and applied to a stainless steel sample plate. The mixture was then allowed to air dry on the sample plate before being introduced into the mass spectrometer. Each spectrum was produced by accumulating data from 50-256 laser pulses. Time-to-mass conversion was achieved by external or internal calibration using bradykinin (MH+ at m/z 1061.2) and insulin (MH+ at m/z 5734.6). The accuracy of mass assignments was approximately ± 0.1% (± 1 Da/1000 Da). A computer program, MSU MassMap (26Liao P.C. Leykam J. Andrews P.C. Gage D.A. Allison J. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 219: 9-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) was used to calculate the average masses of all possible peptide and phosphopeptide fragments from CD45, and the m/z value of the mass spectral peak for the corresponding MH+ ion. Dephosphorylation of 5 μl of the HPLC fractions containing phosphopeptide was achieved by incubation of the peptide with 1∼2 units of calf intestine alkaline phosphatase in 50 mM NH4HCO3 buffer (pH 8.0) at 37°C for 4 h. Digestion of TLC isolated peptide a with hydroxylamine was performed in 2 M guanidine·HCl, 2 M NH2OH·HCl, 0.2 M K2CO3 (Sigma), pH 9, for 4 h at 45°C (24van der Geer P. Luo K. Sefton B.W. Hunter T. Celis J.E. Cell Biology: A Laboratory Handbook. Vol. 3. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1994: 422-447Crossref Google Scholar). After NH2OH digestion the peptide was purified by HPLC using conditions described above to remove salts (yielding a single radioactive peak at 21 min, retention time) and was analyzed by one-dimensional TLC using the conditions described above. The NH2OH-digested peptide was then digested with 1 μg of endoproteinase Glu-C (Boehringer Mannheim) in 50 mM NH4HCO3, pH 7.8, 18 h at 25°C. The NH2OH- and endoproteinase Glu-C-digested peptide a was then analyzed by one-dimensional TLC as described above. Radioactivity was detected using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager. Purified rat brain PKC was provided by Dr. A. Nairn (Rockefeller University, New York, NY), and the purified, bacterially expressed cytoplasmic domain of murine CD45 was provided by Dr. P. Johnson (University of British Columbia, Canada) (27Ng D.H. Maiti A. Johnson P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 206: 302-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation of 1 μg of cytoplasmic CD45 was carried out with 1 μg of PKC at 30°C for 30 min in 20 mM Tris·HCl (pH 7.4), 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 50 μg/ml phosphatidylserine, 100 nM PMA, 2 mM CaCl2, and 0.01 mCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol, DuPont NEN). The reaction was terminated by the addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer. The sample was then boiled and resolved on a 4-15% SDS-PAGE gradient gel and transferred to a PVDF membrane, followed by autoradiography. The CD45 band was excised, digested with trypsin, and analyzed as described above. In an effort to map the in vivo phosphorylation sites of CD45, we first prepared a two-dimensional map of tryptic phosphopeptides from 70Z/3.12 cells cultured at high density (8 × 105 cells/ml). Cells were labeled with [32P]orthophosphate for 4 h and immunoprecipitated CD45 was separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF for autoradiography (Fig. 1A). The CD45 band was excised, digested with trypsin, and subjected to two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping (Fig. 1B). Tryptic phosphopeptides were designated a-h (Fig. 1B). Phosphoamino acid analysis of each of the radioactive peptides eluted from the TLC plate (Fig. 2) revealed that each contained only Ser phosphorylation, except for phosphopeptide a, which contained both Ser and Thr phosphorylation in about a 1:1 ratio (Fig. 2, lane 2). No tyrosine phosphorylation of CD45 was detected. Betascope and phosphorimage analysis was used in this work, because it was quantitative and it allowed the detection of very low levels of radioactivity. Reverse-phase HPLC was performed to isolate larger quantities of the tryptic phosphopeptides for detailed analysis of the phosphorylation sites of CD45. Approximately 40 μg of CD45 (about 200 pmol) was purified from 5 × 109 70Z/3.12 cells (8 × 105 cells/ml) by immunoprecipitation with M1/9.3.4 monoclonal antibody. A radioactive tracer was prepared by immunoprecipitating CD45 from 4 × 107 70Z/3.12 cells (8 × 105 cells/ml) labeled with 4 mCi of 32Pi for 4 h, and added to the nonradioactive preparation. After tryptic digestion, the CD45 peptide mixture was subjected to fractionation by HPLC. Fractions were collected every 30 s and numbered according to HPLC retention time (Fig. 3A). The radioactive fractions were identified by application of 1 μl of each fraction to a TLC plate, followed by Betascope detection (Fig. 3B). Fractions at the following times were found to be radioactive and are hereafter designated by their retention time: 4, 18, 18.5, 20.5, 21, 21.5, 22, and 23. Each radioactive HPLC fraction was aligned with each phosphopeptide from two-dimensional phosphopeptide map by subjecting each HPLC fraction to one-dimensional TLE and one-dimensional TLC (Fig. 4, A and B). The unique mobility in one dimension of each spot allowed us to correlate the HPLC fraction with the two-dimensional phosphopeptide map. TLE analysis indicated that each HPLC fraction contained primarily one radioactive peptide, except for fraction 4, which contained two peptides (designated peptide b/c on the two-dimensional phosphopeptide map). TLC analysis indicated that each HPLC fraction contained primarily one radioactive peptide, except for fraction 21.5 which was separated into two phosphopeptides on TLC (designated peptide e,f). The TLE and TLC results matched the HPLC results in which both fraction 4 and 21.5 eluted as doublets. The HPLC chromatographic pattern was consistent with TLE (each consecutive fraction (except part of 4 and 18.5) generally became less charged; Fig. 4A) and TLC (each consecutive fraction became more hydrophobic; Fig. 4B). The results from one dimensional analysis allowed the correlation of each radioactive HPLC peptide fraction with each two-dimensional phosphopeptide spot (peptide designation shown at the bottom of Fig. 4). The analysis of fractions 18 and 20.5 is not shown since these were found to be the same as peptides 18.5 and 21, respectively. Phosphoamino acid analysis of each radioactive HPLC fraction indicated the presence of Ser(P), except for fraction 18.5, which also contained Thr(P) (data not shown), thus confirming that this fraction was the two-dimensional phosphopeptide spot a. MALDI-MS analysis was performed on each radioactive HPLC fraction to determine the identity of the CD45 phosphopeptides. The observed mass values obtained for each radioactive HPLC fraction were compared with a table of predicted masses of all possible tryptic peptides of CD45 cytoplasmic domain below 3000 Da (including partially digested, unphosphorylated, and phosphorylated peptides). Each sample was then treated with alkaline phosphatase and subjected to re-analysis by MALDI-MS to observe loss of phosphate (−80 Da or multiples of −80 Da shifts in the spectra). The results of MALDI-MS analysis for each radioactive HPLC fraction are described below. The MALDI-MS spectrum of HPLC fraction 18.5 contained a single peak at m/z 2960.2 (Fig. 5A). Comparison with a table of calculated mass values of all possible tryptic peptides of CD45 cytoplasmic domain (724 possible peptides) indicated a close match to the predicted peak at 2958.9, corresponding to the monophosphorylated peptide 1239-1268 (Table I., Table II.). Dephosphorylation of the sample followed by MALDI-MS clearly showed a loss of only one phosphate (−80 Da) to m/z 2880.0. Because phosphoamino acid analysis showed peptide a was phosphorylated equally on Ser and Thr, it must therefore consist of a mixture of phosphopeptides with the same sequence: one with a single Ser(P) and one with a single Thr(P). The Ser(P) and Thr(P) sites were localized using the following strategy. Digestion of peptide a with NH2OH at Asn-Gly resulted in a single 32P-phosphopeptide, which eluted at 21 min from HPLC, compared with undigested peptide a, which eluted at 18.5 min (data not shown). This HPLC-purified peptide contained both Ser(P) and Thr(P) (data not shown) and had a slightly slower mobility by TLC than peptide a (Fig. 5B, lanes 2 and 3). (HPLC purification was required to remove salts before TLC or enzymatic digestion.). Thorough digestion of the HPLC purified radioactive peptide with endoproteinase Glu-C resulted in only one 32P-phosphopeptide with altered TLC mobility (Fig. 5B, lane 4), which contained both Ser(P) and Thr(P) (data not shown). Thus we conclude that the phosphorylation sites of peptide a were Thr1246 and Ser1248. This conclusion is based on the observation that only the N-terminal portion of peptide a, after digestion at Asn-Gly, contains Glu. Furthermore, extensive digestion of this peptide with endoproteinase Glu-C results in only one product with a single Ser and a single Thr. Fraction 4 contained two extremely hydrophilic Ser(P)-containing phosphopeptides, b and c, which were found in the non-retained fraction from the HPLC column. Mass spectral signals for this fraction were not obtained. Their signals were probably suppressed by co-eluting salt contaminants, and efforts to remove the peptides from these contaminants were not successful. MALDI-MS analysis of fraction 21, peptide d (Fig. 6A), exhibited one phosphorylated peak and one non-phosphorylated CD45 peptide. The mass spectral peak at m/z 2127.4 shifted to m/z 2048.3 (−80 Da) after treatment with alkaline phosphatase (Table I). Ser1204 was identified as the phosphorylation site, since there is only one Ser in this peptide and Thr(P) was not detected by phosphoamino acid analysis. The other major peak at m/z 1548.0 did not move after phosphatase treatment and was identified as an unphosphorylated CD45 peptide (573-585) from the membrane-proximal region of the cytoplasmic domain. MALDI-MS analysis of fraction 21.5 showed three major peaks that correspond to CD45 peptides in the fraction (Fig. 6B). One at m/z 1548.0 represented the same unphosphorylated fragment identified in the previous fraction. The other two peaks, m/z 1886.2 and 1999.6, were found to shift by −80 Da after dephosphorylation: m/z 1999.6 to m/z 1921.6 and m/z 1886.2 to m/z 1807.5 (Fig. 6B). Two phosphopeptides were also found in this fraction by one-dimensional TLC (Fig. 4B). The peak at m/z 1999.6 was compared with the calculated mass values and identified as peptide e with a calculated m/z of 1999.0 (Table I). The only possible phosphorylation site, Ser1204, was the same phosphorylation site of peptide d, and the difference between phosphopeptide d and e is one N-terminal Lys. The observed mass of peptide f, m/z 1886.2 (Fig. 6B), did not match any tryptic phosphopeptide of CD45 but instead matched a product of peptide d involving loss of the C-terminal GGK from peptide d (loss of 242.4 Da (calculated)). Instability of the Asp-X (D-X) peptide bond at low pH is well known and likely resulted in backbone cleavage of the D-G bond in our peptides (28Oliyai C. Borchardt R.T. Pharm.

https://openalex.org/W2034020444,"Human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) Tat, a nuclear transcription factor, has been shown to function extracellularly, implying that some Tat molecules escape nuclear import and are secreted. This raises the question of what regulates, in HIV-1-infected cells, the nuclear targeting of the polypeptide. Here we show that cytosolic components activated by Ca2+ ions are required to reveal the karyophilic properties of Tat: in vitro translated Tat molecules do not associate with isolated nuclei unless preincubated with Ca2+. Moreover, Ca2+ ions induce karyophilicity of chemically synthesized Tat molecules only upon addition of cytosolic extracts. The Ca2+-induced karyophilicity is prevented by inhibitors of either tyrosine kinases (herbimycin A and genistein) or tyrosine phosphatases (vanadate), suggesting the involvement of Ca2+-dependent phosphorylation/dephosphorylation events. In line with these observations, the transcriptional activity of Tat is inhibited by treatment with either vanadate or genistein. The same occurs with Tat mutants lacking either one or both the two tyrosine residues (positions 26 and 47). Hence, Ca2+-dependent tyrosine kinase(s) and phosphatase(s) act on accessory cellular protein(s), which in turn are responsible of Tat karyophilicity.

Moreover, Ca2+ ions induce karyophilicity of chemically synthesized Tat molecules only upon addition of cytosolic extracts. The Ca2+-induced karyophilicity is prevented by inhibitors of either tyrosine kinases (herbimycin A and genistein) or tyrosine phosphatases (vanadate), suggesting the involvement of Ca2+-dependent phosphorylation/dephosphorylation events. In line with these observations, the transcriptional activity of Tat is inhibited by treatment with either vanadate or genistein. The same occurs with Tat mutants lacking either one or both the two tyrosine residues (positions 26 and 47). Hence, Ca2+-dependent tyrosine kinase(s) and phosphatase(s) act on accessory cellular protein(s), which in turn are responsible of Tat karyophilicity. INTRODUCTIONIn eukaryotic cells, gene expression is often regulated by post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation (1Hunter T. Karin M. Cell. 1992; 70: 375-387Google Scholar) of the relevant transcription factors or associated proteins. These modifications may modulate the cellular localization of the transcription factors, their DNA binding capacity, or their transactivating activity. Examples of transcription factors able to undergo inducible nuclear import include steroid receptors (2Picard D. Khursheed B. Garabedian M.J. Fortin M.G. Lindquist S. Yamamoto K.R. Nature. 1990; 348: 166-168Google Scholar), the v-jun oncogenic counterpart of the AP-1 complex member c-jun (3Tagawa T. Kuroki T. Vogt P.K. Chida K. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 255-263Google Scholar), the yeast SW15 (4Moll T. Tebb G. Surana U. Robitsch H. Nasmyth K. Cell. 1991; 66: 743-758Google Scholar), and NF-κB, which is imported to the nucleus following dissociation from the cytosolic anchoring protein IκB-a (5Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore D. Science. 1988; 242: 540-546Google Scholar, 6Gosh S. Baltimore D. Nature. 1990; 344: 678-682Google Scholar).In addition to this group of transcription factors, which have a different intracellular localization depending on their functional state, many examples of proteins with dual intracellular targeting have been reported (7Danpure C.J. Trends Cell Biol. 1995; 5: 230-238Google Scholar).

Myristoylation is the dominant signal. However, a small subset of MA molecules undergo tyrosine phosphorylation, and this modification is sufficient to reveal their karyophilic properties (8Gallay P. Swingler S. Aiken C. Trono D. Cell. 1995; 80: 379-388Google Scholar). The case of human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) Tat is still more complex, as in addition to its transactivating function, necessary for viral replication (9Wright C.M. Felber B.K. Paskalis H. Pavlakis G.N. Science. 1986; 234: 988-992Google Scholar, 10Jones K.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 461-468Google Scholar), it can also be secreted by transfected or virus-infected cells (11Ensoli B. Barillari G. Salahuddin S.Z. Gallo R.C. Wong-Staal F. Nature. 1990; 345: 84-86Google Scholar) and exert several extracellular activities that interfere with growth regulation of different cells (12Albini A. Benelli R. Presta M. Rusnati M. Ziche M.

Nature. 1995; 375: 497-500Google Scholar). While much effort has been spent on elucidating the molecular details of transactivation of HIV-1, the mechanisms regulating nuclear import versus secretion of Tat protein are largely unknown.In a previous study, we have shown that Tat molecules, synthesized in vitro in wheat germ extracts, do not associate with nuclei when added to lysed cells (14Bonifaci N. Sitia R. Rubartelli A. AIDS. 1995; 9: 995-1000Google Scholar); however, we noted that after a period of incubation in culture medium, some Tat molecules became capable of associating postlytically with the nuclear fraction, suggesting that some components of the culture medium might induce modification(s) on Tat molecules that reveal its karyophilicity.Here we exploit in vitro and in vivo assays to investigate the effects of Ca2+ and of cytosolic factors on the nuclear targeting of Tat.DISCUSSIONIn this paper we describe a novel mechanism of control of HIV-1 Tat activity, involving tyrosine phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of cytosolic component(s), whose activation, dependent on Ca2+, unveils the karyophilicity of Tat.The kinetics and the irreversibility of the Ca2+-induced karyophilicity (Fig. 1) suggest that Ca2+ ions do not act directly on Tat itself; this notion is further supported by the observation that chemically synthesized Tat does not associate to nuclei after treatement with Ca2+ unless cytosolic factors are added.

Today. 1992; 13: 136-142Google Scholar); in contrast, while the importance of TKs and PTPases in the early steps of signal transduction is well established, their direct involvement in regulating the activity of transcription factors is less defined. Tyrosine phosphorylation of the three subunits of the interferon-stimulated gene factor 3 appears to be responsible for their translocation into the nucleus and hence their activation (22Fu X.-Y. Cell. 1992; 70: 323-335Google Scholar); the regulatory enzyme involved is TYK-2, a cytoplasmic, Ca2+-independent TK induced by interferon-α (23Velazquez L. Fellous M. Stark G.R. Pellegrini S. Cell. 1992; 70: 313-322Google Scholar). Another example of differential targeting modulated by tyrosine phosphorylation is HIV-1 MA protein (8Gallay P. Swingler S. Aiken C. Trono D. Cell. 1995; 80: 379-388Google Scholar).In the case of Tat, substitution of either one or both Tyr-26 or Tyr-47 results in mutant Tat molecules that undergo the same control of nuclear association as wild type Tat. These observations confirm that the Ca2+-activated TK/PTPases involved do not act directly on Tat molecules. Rather, these data suggest that the target of the phosphorylation is accessory protein(s), perhaps involved in chaperoning Tat molecules to the nucleus. In agreement with this, the functional activity is only slightly inhibited when Tyr-26 and/or Tyr-47 are replaced: these mutants are able to transactivate a reporter gene at approximately the same extent as wild type Tat. Three Tat mutants bearing single substitution of Tyr-26 with Ala or Tyr-47 with Ala or histidine have been reported previously (24Kuppuswamy M. Subramanian T. Srinivasan A. Chinnadurai G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 6: 331-357Google Scholar, 25Rice A.P. Carlotti F. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 1864-1868Google Scholar); in these mutants substitution of either tyrosine did not abolish Tat transcriptional activity, although Ala-26 had a weaker activity in HeLa cells. The maintainance of the full activity by the Tat mutants described here may be due to the more conservative substitution of Tyr with Phe.The TK/PTPases-mediated induction of Tat karyophilicity has a functional correspondence in the finding that genistein and vanadate ihibit HIV-1 LTR transactivation in transfected cells, of either lymphoid or non-lymphoid origin. Genistein and vanadate also inhibit transactivating activity of the three Tyr mutants, confirming that the TK/PTPases involved in Tat nuclear targeting and transcriptional activity act on accessory protein(s).Our observations of a more effective transactivation of LTR-β galactosidase in stimulated rather than in resting Jurkat T cells are in line with previous reports (26Siekevitz M. Josephs S.F. Ducovich M. Peffer N. Wong-Staal F. Greene W.C. Science. 1987; 238: 1575-1578Google Scholar, 27Tong-Starksen S.E. Luciw P.A. Peterlin B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 6845-6849Google Scholar) and support the hypothesis of a role for intracellular [Ca2+] in regulating Tat activity. The immunosuppressive drug CsA was shown to block the Tat-mediated increase of IL-2 promoter activity in activated T cells (28Westendorp M.O. Li-Weber M. Frank R.W. Krammer P.H. J. Virol. 1994; 67: 4177-4185Google Scholar). Similarly, we show that CsA inhibits LTR transactivation in stimulated, but not resting, T cells, suggesting that, in activated cells, additional, CsA-sensitive, cellular factors act in concert with Tat with resulting activation of HIV-1 gene expression.Altogether, these findings suggest that, depending on their activation state, HIV-1-infected cells have the possibility of modifying the intracellular fate and the transcriptional activity of Tat by modulating its karyophilicity through activation of TK/PTPase, with obvious influence on viral replication and on the development of HIV-associated syndromes. Compounds that block the activity of these enzymes may lead to novel strategies to slow the spread of the virus in HIV-infected individuals.

Today. 1992; 13: 136-142Google Scholar); in contrast, while the importance of TKs and PTPases in the early steps of signal transduction is well established, their direct involvement in regulating the activity of transcription factors is less defined. Tyrosine phosphorylation of the three subunits of the interferon-stimulated gene factor 3 appears to be responsible for their translocation into the nucleus and hence their activation (22Fu X.-Y. Cell. 1992; 70: 323-335Google Scholar); the regulatory enzyme involved is TYK-2, a cytoplasmic, Ca2+-independent TK induced by interferon-α (23Velazquez L. Fellous M. Stark G.R. Pellegrini S. Cell. 1992; 70: 313-322Google Scholar). Another example of differential targeting modulated by tyrosine phosphorylation is HIV-1 MA protein (8Gallay P. Swingler S. Aiken C. Trono D. Cell. 1995; 80: 379-388Google Scholar).In the case of Tat, substitution of either one or both Tyr-26 or Tyr-47 results in mutant Tat molecules that undergo the same control of nuclear association as wild type Tat. These observations confirm that the Ca2+-activated TK/PTPases involved do not act directly on Tat molecules. Rather, these data suggest that the target of the phosphorylation is accessory protein(s), perhaps involved in chaperoning Tat molecules to the nucleus. In agreement with this, the functional activity is only slightly inhibited when Tyr-26 and/or Tyr-47 are replaced: these mutants are able to transactivate a reporter gene at approximately the same extent as wild type Tat. Three Tat mutants bearing single substitution of Tyr-26 with Ala or Tyr-47 with Ala or histidine have been reported previously (24Kuppuswamy M. Subramanian T. Srinivasan A. Chinnadurai G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 6: 331-357Google Scholar, 25Rice A.P. Carlotti F. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 1864-1868Google Scholar); in these mutants substitution of either tyrosine did not abolish Tat transcriptional activity, although Ala-26 had a weaker activity in HeLa cells. The maintainance of the full activity by the Tat mutants described here may be due to the more conservative substitution of Tyr with Phe.The TK/PTPases-mediated induction of Tat karyophilicity has a functional correspondence in the finding that genistein and vanadate ihibit HIV-1 LTR transactivation in transfected cells, of either lymphoid or non-lymphoid origin. Genistein and vanadate also inhibit transactivating activity of the three Tyr mutants, confirming that the TK/PTPases involved in Tat nuclear targeting and transcriptional activity act on accessory protein(s).Our observations of a more effective transactivation of LTR-β galactosidase in stimulated rather than in resting Jurkat T cells are in line with previous reports (26Siekevitz M. Josephs S.F. Ducovich M. Peffer N. Wong-Staal F. Greene W.C. Science. 1987; 238: 1575-1578Google Scholar, 27Tong-Starksen S.E. Luciw P.A. Peterlin B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 6845-6849Google Scholar) and support the hypothesis of a role for intracellular [Ca2+] in regulating Tat activity. The immunosuppressive drug CsA was shown to block the Tat-mediated increase of IL-2 promoter activity in activated T cells (28Westendorp M.O. Li-Weber M. Frank R.W. Krammer P.H. J. Virol. 1994; 67: 4177-4185Google Scholar). Similarly, we show that CsA inhibits LTR transactivation in stimulated, but not resting, T cells, suggesting that, in activated cells, additional, CsA-sensitive, cellular factors act in concert with Tat with resulting activation of HIV-1 gene expression.Altogether, these findings suggest that, depending on their activation state, HIV-1-infected cells have the possibility of modifying the intracellular fate and the transcriptional activity of Tat by modulating its karyophilicity through activation of TK/PTPase, with obvious influence on viral replication and on the development of HIV-associated syndromes. Compounds that block the activity of these enzymes may lead to novel strategies to slow the spread of the virus in HIV-infected individuals. In this paper we describe a novel mechanism of control of HIV-1 Tat activity, involving tyrosine phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of cytosolic component(s), whose activation, dependent on Ca2+, unveils the karyophilicity of Tat. The kinetics and the irreversibility of the Ca2+-induced karyophilicity (Fig. 1) suggest that Ca2+ ions do not act directly on Tat itself; this notion is further supported by the observation that chemically synthesized Tat does not associate to nuclei after treatement with Ca2+ unless cytosolic factors are added. Ca2+ may thus activate cellular protein(s) which in turn confer karyophilicity to Tat. As drugs blocking either TK or PTPase inhibit karyophilicity, Ca2+-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation/dephosphorylation events seem to be involved in controlling the nuclear association of Tat. The similar inhibitory effects of drugs acting on targets with opposite functions (TK and PTPase) is not surprising as kinases may be activated by dephosphorylation and vice versa (1Hunter T.
