https://openalex.org/W2023545713,"When expression of more than one gene is required in cells, bicistronic or multicistronic expression vectors have been used. Among various strategies employed to construct bicistronic or multicistronic vectors, an internal ribosomal entry site (IRES) has been widely used. Due to the large size and difference in expression levels between genes before and after IRES, however, a new strategy was required to replace IRES. A self-cleaving 2A peptide could be a good candidate to replace IRES because of its small size and high cleavage efficiency between genes upstream and downstream of the 2A peptide. Despite the advantages of the 2A peptides, its use is not widespread because (i) there are no publicly available cloning vectors harboring a 2A peptide gene and (ii) comprehensive comparison of cleavage efficiency among various 2A peptides reported to date has not been performed in different contexts. Here, we generated four expression plasmids each harboring different 2A peptides derived from the foot-and-mouth disease virus, equine rhinitis A virus, Thosea asigna virus and porcine teschovirus-1, respectively, and evaluated their cleavage efficiency in three commonly used human cell lines, zebrafish embryos and adult mice. Western blotting and confocal microscopic analyses revealed that among the four 2As, the one derived from porcine teschovirus-1 (P2A) has the highest cleavage efficiency in all the contexts examined. We anticipate that the 2A-harboring cloning vectors we generated and the highest efficiency of the P2A peptide we demonstrated would help biomedical researchers easily adopt the 2A technology when bicistronic or multicistronic expression is required."

https://openalex.org/W2136144150,"Nucleosomes are the basic packaging units of chromatin, modulating accessibility of regulatory proteins to DNA and thus influencing eukaryotic gene regulation. Elaborate chromatin remodelling mechanisms have evolved that govern nucleosome organization at promoters, regulatory elements, and other functional regions in the genome. Analyses of chromatin landscape have uncovered a variety of mechanisms, including DNA sequence preferences, that can influence nucleosome positions. To identify major determinants of nucleosome organization in the human genome, we used deep sequencing to map nucleosome positions in three primary human cell types and in vitro. A majority of the genome showed substantial flexibility of nucleosome positions, whereas a small fraction showed reproducibly positioned nucleosomes. Certain sites that position in vitro can anchor the formation of nucleosomal arrays that have cell type-specific spacing in vivo. Our results unveil an interplay of sequence-based nucleosome preferences and non-nucleosomal factors in determining nucleosome organization within mammalian cells."
https://openalex.org/W1968578345,"Endocytic sorting of signalling receptors between recycling and degradative pathways is a key cellular process controlling the surface complement of receptors and, accordingly, the cell's ability to respond to specific extracellular stimuli. The β2 adrenergic receptor (β2AR) is a prototypical seven-transmembrane signalling receptor that recycles rapidly and efficiently to the plasma membrane after ligand-induced endocytosis. β2AR recycling is dependent on the receptor's carboxy-terminal PDZ ligand and Rab4. This active sorting process is required for functional resensitization of β2AR-mediated signalling. Here we show that sequence-directed sorting occurs at the level of entry into retromer tubules and that retromer tubules are associated with Rab4. Furthermore, we show that sorting nexin 27 (SNX27) serves as an essential adaptor protein linking β2ARs to the retromer tubule. SNX27 does not seem to directly interact with the retromer core complex, but does interact with the retromer-associated Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein and SCAR homologue (WASH) complex. The present results identify a role for retromer in endocytic trafficking of signalling receptors, in regulating a receptor-linked signalling pathway, and in mediating direct endosome-to-plasma membrane traffic."
https://openalex.org/W2140544512,"Mutations in the Wnt co-receptor, LRP5, lead to skeletal diseases in humans. Matthew Warman and his colleagues have now developed mutant mice with tissue-specific alterations of Lrp5 expression and found that these mice phenocopy the human skeletal diseases. They also found that Lrp5 acts locally to affect bone homeostasis. Their data suggest that increasing LRP5 signaling in mature bone cells may be a strategy to treat osteoporosis. The human skeleton is affected by mutations in low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 5 (LRP5). To understand how LRP5 influences bone properties, we generated mice with osteocyte-specific expression of inducible Lrp5 mutations that cause high and low bone mass phenotypes in humans. We found that bone properties in these mice were comparable to bone properties in mice with inherited mutations. We also induced an Lrp5 mutation in cells that form the appendicular skeleton but not in cells that form the axial skeleton; we observed that bone properties were altered in the limb but not in the spine. These data indicate that Lrp5 signaling functions locally, and they suggest that increasing LRP5 signaling in mature bone cells may be a strategy for treating human disorders associated with low bone mass, such as osteoporosis."
https://openalex.org/W2166180044,"Current approaches for analyzing the functional heterogeneity of immune cells include ELISPOT and flow cytometry. Chao Ma et al. have introduced an antibody-barcode microchip platform that enables the measurement of a large panel of secreted proteins from several hundred single cells or small cell colonies in parallel. The platform offers advantages over existing technologies in terms of cost, multiplexing capacity, types of proteins that can be measured and experiments performed. Cellular immunity has an inherent high level of functional heterogeneity. Capturing the full spectrum of these functions requires analysis of large numbers of effector molecules from single cells. We report a microfluidic platform designed for highly multiplexed (more than ten proteins), reliable, sample-efficient (∼1 × 104 cells) and quantitative measurements of secreted proteins from single cells. We validated the platform by assessment of multiple inflammatory cytokines from lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated human macrophages and comparison to standard immunotechnologies. We applied the platform toward the ex vivo quantification of T cell polyfunctional diversity via the simultaneous measurement of a dozen effector molecules secreted from tumor antigen–specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) that were actively responding to tumor and compared against a cohort of healthy donor controls. We observed profound, yet focused, functional heterogeneity in active tumor antigen–specific CTLs, with the major functional phenotypes quantitatively identified. The platform represents a new and informative tool for immune monitoring and clinical assessment."
https://openalex.org/W2097072854,"The innate immune system targets PAMPs (pathogen-associated molecular patterns) — invariant molecules crucial to the composition of microbial cells but absent from host tissues — to discriminate self from non-self structures. Now, a similar mechanism has been implicated in determining the differences in the immune response to viable and dead pathogens. Sander et al. identify stimulatory messenger RNA, present in live but not dead bacteria, as a viability-associated PAMP, or vita-PAMP. By incorporating vita-PAMPs in vaccines, it might be possible to combine the efficacy of a live vaccine with the safety associated with dead vaccines. Live vaccines have long been known to trigger far more vigorous immune responses than their killed counterparts1,2,3,4,5,6. This has been attributed to the ability of live microorganisms to replicate and express specialized virulence factors that facilitate invasion and infection of their hosts7. However, protective immunization can often be achieved with a single injection of live, but not dead, attenuated microorganisms stripped of their virulence factors. Pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), which are detected by the immune system8,9, are present in both live and killed vaccines, indicating that certain poorly characterized aspects of live microorganisms, not incorporated in dead vaccines, are particularly effective at inducing protective immunity. Here we show that the mammalian innate immune system can directly sense microbial viability through detection of a special class of viability-associated PAMPs (vita-PAMPs). We identify prokaryotic messenger RNA as a vita-PAMP present only in viable bacteria, the recognition of which elicits a unique innate response and a robust adaptive antibody response. Notably, the innate response evoked by viability and prokaryotic mRNA was thus far considered to be reserved for pathogenic bacteria, but we show that even non-pathogenic bacteria in sterile tissues can trigger similar responses, provided that they are alive. Thus, the immune system actively gauges the infectious risk by searching PAMPs for signatures of microbial life and thus infectivity. Detection of vita-PAMPs triggers a state of alert not warranted for dead bacteria. Vaccine formulations that incorporate vita-PAMPs could thus combine the superior protection of live vaccines with the safety of dead vaccines."
https://openalex.org/W2144750363,"Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) have been differentiated efficiently to neuronal cell types. However, directed differentiation of hPSCs to astrocytes and astroglial subtypes remains elusive. In this study, hPSCs were directed to nearly uniform populations of immature astrocytes (>90% S100β(+) and GFAP(+)) in large quantities. The immature human astrocytes exhibit similar gene expression patterns as primary astrocytes, display functional properties such as glutamate uptake and promotion of synaptogenesis, and become mature astrocytes by forming connections with blood vessels after transplantation into the mouse brain. Furthermore, hPSC-derived neuroepithelia, patterned to rostral-caudal and dorsal-ventral identities with the same morphogens used for neuronal subtype specification, generate immature astrocytes that express distinct homeodomain transcription factors and display phenotypic differences of different astroglial subtypes. These human astroglial progenitors and immature astrocytes will be useful for studying astrocytes in brain development and function, understanding the roles of astrocytes in disease processes and developing novel treatments for neurological disorders."

https://openalex.org/W1985921653,"Immune responses targeting self-proteins (autoantigens) can lead to a variety of autoimmune diseases. Identification of these antigens is important for both diagnostic and therapeutic reasons. However, current approaches to characterize autoantigens have, in most cases, met only with limited success. Here we present a synthetic representation of the complete human proteome, the T7 peptidome phage display library (T7-Pep), and demonstrate its application to autoantigen discovery. T7-Pep is composed of >413,000 36-residue, overlapping peptides that cover all open reading frames in the human genome, and can be analyzed using high-throughput DNA sequencing. We developed a phage immunoprecipitation sequencing (PhIP-Seq) methodology to identify known and previously unreported autoantibodies contained in the spinal fluid of three individuals with paraneoplastic neurological syndromes. We also show how T7-Pep can be used more generally to identify peptide-protein interactions, suggesting the broader utility of our approach for proteomic research."

Heat-maps have proven very useful for the representation of biological data. Here we present Gitools (http://www.gitools.org), an open-source tool to perform analyses and visualize data and results as interactive heat-maps. Gitools contains data import systems from several sources (i.e. IntOGen, Biomart, KEGG, Gene Ontology), which facilitate the integration of novel data with previous knowledge."
https://openalex.org/W2012918968,"The differentiation of patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) to committed fates such as neurons, muscle and liver is a powerful approach for understanding key parameters of human development and disease. Whether undifferentiated iPSCs themselves can be used to probe disease mechanisms is uncertain. Dyskeratosis congenita is characterized by defective maintenance of blood, pulmonary tissue and epidermal tissues and is caused by mutations in genes controlling telomere homeostasis. Short telomeres, a hallmark of dyskeratosis congenita, impair tissue stem cell function in mouse models, indicating that a tissue stem cell defect may underlie the pathophysiology of dyskeratosis congenita. Here we show that even in the undifferentiated state, iPSCs from dyskeratosis congenita patients harbour the precise biochemical defects characteristic of each form of the disease and that the magnitude of the telomere maintenance defect in iPSCs correlates with clinical severity. In iPSCs from patients with heterozygous mutations in TERT, the telomerase reverse transcriptase, a 50% reduction in telomerase levels blunts the natural telomere elongation that accompanies reprogramming. In contrast, mutation of dyskerin (DKC1) in X-linked dyskeratosis congenita severely impairs telomerase activity by blocking telomerase assembly and disrupts telomere elongation during reprogramming. In iPSCs from a form of dyskeratosis congenita caused by mutations in TCAB1 (also known as WRAP53), telomerase catalytic activity is unperturbed, yet the ability of telomerase to lengthen telomeres is abrogated, because telomerase mislocalizes from Cajal bodies to nucleoli within the iPSCs. Extended culture of DKC1-mutant iPSCs leads to progressive telomere shortening and eventual loss of self-renewal, indicating that a similar process occurs in tissue stem cells in dyskeratosis congenita patients. These findings in iPSCs from dyskeratosis congenita patients reveal that undifferentiated iPSCs accurately recapitulate features of a human stem cell disease and may serve as a cell-culture-based system for the development of targeted therapeutics."
https://openalex.org/W1992816628,"Mechanisms of signal transduction regulation remain a fundamental question in a variety of biological processes and diseases. Previous evidence indicates that the primary cilium can act as a signalling hub, but its exact role in many of the described pathways has remained elusive. Here, we investigate the mechanism of cilia-mediated regulation of the canonical Wnt pathway. We found that primary cilia dampen canonical Wnt signalling through a spatial mechanism involving compartmentalization of signalling components. The cilium, through regulated intraflagellar transport, diverts Jouberin (Jbn), a ciliopathy protein and context-specific Wnt pathway regulator, away from the nucleus and limits β-catenin nuclear entry. This repressive regulation does not silence the pathway, but instead maintains a discrete range of Wnt responsiveness; cells without cilia have potentiated Wnt responses, whereas cells with multiple cilia have inhibited responses. Furthermore, we show that this regulation occurs during embryonic development and is disrupted in cancer cell proliferation. Together these data explain a spatial mechanism of Wnt signalling regulation that may provide insight into ciliary regulation of other signalling pathways."

https://openalex.org/W2131328125,"Garry Cutting and colleagues report a genome-wide association and linkage study for loci that affect lung disease severity in cystic fibrosis. They identify two loci that influence lung function in individuals with cystic fibrosis. A combined genome-wide association and linkage study was used to identify loci causing variation in cystic fibrosis lung disease severity. We identified a significant association (P = 3.34 × 10−8) near EHF and APIP (chr11p13) in p.Phe508del homozygotes (n = 1,978). The association replicated in p.Phe508del homozygotes (P = 0.006) from a separate family based study (n = 557), with P = 1.49 × 10−9 for the three-study joint meta-analysis. Linkage analysis of 486 sibling pairs from the family based study identified a significant quantitative trait locus on chromosome 20q13.2 (log10 odds = 5.03). Our findings provide insight into the causes of variation in lung disease severity in cystic fibrosis and suggest new therapeutic targets for this life-limiting disorder."
https://openalex.org/W2048883388,"Christopher Haiman and colleagues report a genome-wide association study for prostate cancer in African-American males drawn from 11 epidemiological studies of prostate cancer, with replication including individuals of African ancestry from 10 additional studies worldwide. They identify a new susceptibility locus on chromosome 17q21, for which the risk allele shows a higher frequency in men of African ancestry than in other populations. This may explain some of the increased incidence of prostate cancer in men of African ancestry. In search of common risk alleles for prostate cancer that could contribute to high rates of the disease in men of African ancestry, we conducted a genome-wide association study, with 1,047,986 SNP markers examined in 3,425 African-Americans with prostate cancer (cases) and 3,290 African-American male controls. We followed up the most significant 17 new associations from stage 1 in 1,844 cases and 3,269 controls of African ancestry. We identified a new risk variant on chromosome 17q21 (rs7210100, odds ratio per allele = 1.51, P = 3.4 × 10−13). The frequency of the risk allele is ∼5% in men of African descent, whereas it is rare in other populations (<1%). Further studies are needed to investigate the biological contribution of this allele to prostate cancer risk. These findings emphasize the importance of conducting genome-wide association studies in diverse populations."
https://openalex.org/W1995005155,"Glutamate acting on N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors induces neuronal injury following stroke, through activation of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) and generation of the death molecule poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR) polymer. Here we identify Iduna, a previously undescribed NMDA receptor–induced survival protein that is neuroprotective against glutamate NMDA receptor–mediated excitotoxicity both in vitro and in vivo and against stroke through interfering with PAR polymer–induced cell death (parthanatos). Iduna's protective effects are independent and downstream of PARP-1 activity. Iduna is a PAR polymer–binding protein, and mutation at the PAR polymer binding site abolishes the PAR binding activity of Iduna and attenuates its protective actions. Iduna is protective in vivo against NMDA-induced excitotoxicity and middle cerebral artery occlusion–induced stroke in mice. To our knowledge, these results define Iduna as the first known endogenous inhibitor of parthanatos. Interfering with PAR polymer signaling could be a new therapeutic strategy for the treatment of neurologic disorders."

https://openalex.org/W2140061722,"The ear is a remarkably sensitive pressure fluctuation detector. In guinea pigs, behavioral measurements indicate a minimum detectable sound pressure of ∼20 μPa at 16 kHz. Such faint sounds produce 0.1-nm basilar membrane displacements, a distance smaller than conformational transitions in ion channels. It seems that noise within the auditory system would swamp such tiny motions, making weak sounds imperceptible. Here we propose a new mechanism contributing to a resolution of this problem and validate it through direct measurement. We hypothesized that vibration at the apical side of hair cells is enhanced compared with that at the commonly measured basilar membrane side. Using in vivo optical coherence tomography, we demonstrated that apical-side vibrations peaked at a higher frequency, had different timing and were enhanced compared with those at the basilar membrane. These effects depend nonlinearly on the stimulus sound pressure level. The timing difference and enhancement of vibrations are important for explaining how the noise problem is circumvented."
https://openalex.org/W2067519579,"Two crystal structures of a three-domain class II diterpene cyclase with substrate and product analogs provide new insights into the mechanistic pathway of this enzyme and illuminate evolutionary and functional relationships within terpenoid biosynthesis more generally. The structure of ent-copalyl diphosphate synthase reveals three α-helical domains (α, β and γ), as also observed in the related diterpene cyclase taxadiene synthase. However, active sites are located at the interface of the βγ domains in ent-copalyl diphosphate synthase but exclusively in the α domain of taxadiene synthase. Modular domain architecture in plant diterpene cyclases enables the evolution of alternative active sites and chemical strategies for catalyzing isoprenoid cyclization reactions."
https://openalex.org/W2162123959,"Mammalian peptidoglycan recognition proteins (PGRPs) are innate immune effectors that kill bacteria by unclear mechanisms. Kashyap et al. now provide insight into this question and report that PGRPs activate the bacterial two-component system that normally rids the cell of unfolded proteins. PGRP activation of this system abrogates metabolic functions, leading to accumulation of hydroxyl radicals and bacterial cell death. Mammalian peptidoglycan recognition proteins (PGRPs), similar to antimicrobial lectins, bind the bacterial cell wall and kill bacteria through an unknown mechanism. We show that PGRPs enter the Gram-positive cell wall at the site of daughter cell separation during cell division. In Bacillus subtilis, PGRPs activate the CssR-CssS two-component system that detects and disposes of misfolded proteins that are usually exported out of bacterial cells. This activation results in membrane depolarization, cessation of intracellular peptidoglycan, protein, RNA and DNA synthesis, and production of hydroxyl radicals, which are responsible for bacterial death. PGRPs also bind the outer membrane of Escherichia coli and activate the functionally homologous CpxA-CpxR two-component system, which kills the bacteria. We exclude other potential bactericidal mechanisms, including inhibition of extracellular peptidoglycan synthesis, hydrolysis of peptidoglycan and membrane permeabilization. Thus, we reveal a previously unknown mechanism by which innate immunity proteins that bind the cell wall or outer membrane exploit the bacterial stress defense response to kill bacteria."

https://openalex.org/W2155899435,"The molecular events in chordoma pathogenesis have not been fully delineated, particularly with respect to copy number changes. Understanding copy number alterations in chordoma may reveal critical disease mechanisms that could be exploited for tumor classification and therapy. We report the copy number analysis of 21 sporadic chordomas using array comparative genomic hybridization (CGH). Recurrent copy changes were further evaluated with immunohistochemistry, methylation specific PCR, and quantitative real-time PCR. Similar to previous findings, large copy number losses, involving chromosomes 1p, 3, 4, 9, 10, 13, 14, and 18, were more common than copy number gains. Loss of CDKN2A with or without loss of CDKN2B on 9p21.3 was observed in 16/20 (80%) unique cases of which six (30%) showed homozygous deletions ranging from 76 kilobases to 4.7 megabases. One copy loss of the 10q23.31 region which encodes PTEN was found in 16/20 (80%) cases. Loss of CDKN2A and PTEN expression in the majority of cases was not attributed to promoter methylation. Our sporadic chordoma cases did not show hotspot point mutations in some common cancer gene targets. Moreover, most of these sporadic tumors are not associated with T (brachyury) duplication or amplification. Deficiency of CDKN2A and PTEN expression, although shared across many other different types of tumors, likely represents a key aspect of chordoma pathogenesis. Sporadic chordomas may rely on mechanisms other than copy number gain if they indeed exploit T/brachyury for proliferation."
https://openalex.org/W2135419325,"Honeybee foragers frequently fly several kilometres to and from vital resources, and communicate those locations to their nest mates by a symbolic dance language. Research has shown that they achieve this feat by memorizing landmarks and the skyline panorama, using the sun and polarized skylight as compasses and by integrating their outbound flight paths. In order to investigate the capacity of the honeybees' homing abilities, we artificially displaced foragers to novel release spots at various distances up to 13 km in the four cardinal directions. Returning bees were individually registered by a radio frequency identification (RFID) system at the hive entrance. We found that homing rate, homing speed and the maximum homing distance depend on the release direction. Bees released in the east were more likely to find their way back home, and returned faster than bees released in any other direction, due to the familiarity of global landmarks seen from the hive. Our findings suggest that such large scale homing is facilitated by global landmarks acting as beacons, and possibly the entire skyline panorama."

https://openalex.org/W1979427988,"Ionizing radiation is a genotoxic agent and human carcinogen. Recent work has questioned long-held dogmas by showing that cancer-associated genetic alterations occur in cells and tissues not directly exposed to radiation, questioning the robustness of the current system of radiation risk assessment. In vitro, diverse mechanisms involving secreted soluble factors, gap junction intercellular communication (GJIC) and oxidative metabolism are proposed to mediate these indirect effects. In vivo, the mechanisms behind long-range ‘bystander’ responses remain largely unknown. Here, we investigate the role of GJIC in propagating radiation stress signals in vivo, and in mediating radiation-associated bystander tumorigenesis in mouse central nervous system using a mouse model in which intercellular communication is downregulated by targeted deletion of the connexin43 (Cx43) gene. We show that GJIC is critical for transmission of oncogenic radiation damage to the non-targeted cerebellum, and that a mechanism involving adenosine triphosphate release and upregulation of Cx43, the major GJIC constituent, regulates transduction of oncogenic damage to unirradiated tissues in vivo. Our data provide a novel hypothesis for transduction of distant bystander effects and suggest that the highly branched nervous system, similar to the vascular network, has an important role."
https://openalex.org/W1997837717,"The retinoblastoma protein (RB)-E2F1 pathway has a central role in regulating the cell cycle. Several PAX proteins (tissue-specific developmental regulators), including PAX8, interact with the RB protein, and thus regulate the cell cycle directly or indirectly. Here, we report that PAX8 expression is frequent in renal cell carcinoma, bladder, ovarian and thyroid cancer cell lines, and that silencing of PAX8 in cancer cell lines leads to a striking reduction in the expression of E2F1 and its target genes, as well as a proteasome-dependent destabilization of RB protein, with the RB1 mRNA level remaining unaffected. Cancer cells expressing PAX8 undergo a G(1)/S arrest and eventually senesce following PAX8 silencing. We demonstrate that PAX8 transcriptionally regulates the E2F1 promoter directly, and E2F1 transcription is enhanced after RB depletion. RB is recruited to the PAX8-binding site, and is involved in PAX8-mediated E2F1 transcription in cancer cells. Therefore, our results suggest that, in cancer, frequent and persistent expression of PAX8 is required for cell growth control through transcriptional activation of E2F1 expression and upregulation of the RB-E2F1 pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2051131006,"The overexpression of IRX1 gene correlates with the growth arrest in gastric cancer. Furthermore, overexpression of IRX1 gene suppresses peritoneal spreading and long distance metastasis. To explore the precise mechanisms, we investigated whether restoring IRX1 expression affects the angiogenesis or vasculogenic mimicry (VM). Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and chick embryo and SGC-7901 gastric cancer cells were used for angiogenesis and VM analysis. Small interfering RNA was used for analyzing the function of BDKRB2, a downstream target gene of IRX1. As results, the remarkable suppression on peritoneal spreading and pulmonary metastasis of SGC-7901 cells by IRX1 transfectant correlates to reduced angiogenesis as well as VM formation. Using the supernatant from SGC-7901/IRX1 cells, we found a strong inhibiting effect on angiogenesis both in vitro and in chick embryo. SGC-7901/IRX1 cells revealed strong inhibiting effect on VM formation too. By gene-specific RNA interference for BDKRB2, or its effector PAK1, we got an effective inhibition on tube formation, cell proliferation, cell migration and invasion in vitro. In conclusion, enforcing IRX1 expression effectively suppresses peritoneal spreading and pulmonary metastasis via anti-angiogenesis and anti-VM mechanisms, in addition to previously found cell growth and invasion. BDKRB2 and its downstream effector might be potential targets for anti-cancer strategy."
https://openalex.org/W2091619739,"The detection of sound begins when energy derived from acoustic stimuli deflects the hair bundles atop hair cells. As hair bundles move, the viscous friction between stereocilia and the surrounding liquid poses a fundamental challenge to the ear's high sensitivity and sharp frequency selectivity. Part of the solution to this problem lies in the active process that uses energy for frequency-selective sound amplification. Here we demonstrate that a complementary part involves the fluid-structure interaction between the liquid within the hair bundle and the stereocilia. Using force measurement on a dynamically scaled model, finite-element analysis, analytical estimation of hydrodynamic forces, stochastic simulation and high-resolution interferometric measurement of hair bundles, we characterize the origin and magnitude of the forces between individual stereocilia during small hair-bundle deflections. We find that the close apposition of stereocilia effectively immobilizes the liquid between them, which reduces the drag and suppresses the relative squeezing but not the sliding mode of stereociliary motion. The obliquely oriented tip links couple the mechanotransduction channels to this least dissipative coherent mode, whereas the elastic horizontal top connectors stabilize the structure, further reducing the drag. As measured from the distortion products associated with channel gating at physiological stimulation amplitudes of tens of nanometres, the balance of forces in a hair bundle permits a relative mode of motion between adjacent stereocilia that encompasses only a fraction of a nanometre. A combination of high-resolution experiments and detailed numerical modelling of fluid-structure interactions reveals the physical principles behind the basic structural features of hair bundles and shows quantitatively how these organelles are adapted to the needs of sensitive mechanotransduction."
https://openalex.org/W2068872819,"SK2-containing channels are expressed on dendritic spines of mouse CA1 pyramidal neurons and influence synaptic responses, plasticity and learning. Allen et al. find that the long isoform of SK2 directs synaptic SK2-containing channel expression, mediating synaptic and behavioral effects. SK2-containing channels are expressed in the postsynaptic density (PSD) of dendritic spines on mouse hippocampal area CA1 pyramidal neurons and influence synaptic responses, plasticity and learning. The Sk2 gene (also known as Kcnn2) encodes two isoforms that differ only in the length of their N-terminal domains. SK2-long (SK2-L) and SK2-short (SK2-S) are coexpressed in CA1 pyramidal neurons and likely form heteromeric channels. In mice lacking SK2-L (SK2-S only mice), SK2-S–containing channels were expressed in the extrasynaptic membrane, but were excluded from the PSD. The SK channel contribution to excitatory postsynaptic potentials was absent in SK2-S only mice and was restored by SK2-L re-expression. Blocking SK channels increased the amount of long-term potentiation induced in area CA1 in slices from wild-type mice but had no effect in slices from SK2-S only mice. Furthermore, SK2-S only mice outperformed wild-type mice in the novel object recognition task. These results indicate that SK2-L directs synaptic SK2-containing channel expression and is important for normal synaptic signaling, plasticity and learning."
https://openalex.org/W2098532632,"A human endogenous retrovirus type E (HERV-E) was recently found to be selectively expressed in most renal cell carcinomas (RCCs). Importantly, antigens derived from this provirus are immunogenic, stimulating cytotoxic T cells that kill RCC cells in vitro and in vivo. Here, we show HERV-E expression is restricted to the clear cell subtype of RCC (ccRCC) characterized by an inactivation of the von Hippel–Lindau (VHL) tumor-suppressor gene with subsequent stabilization of hypoxia-inducible transcription factors (HIFs)-1α and -2α. HERV-E expression in ccRCC linearly correlated with HIF-2α levels and could be silenced in tumor cells by either transfection of normal VHL or small interfering RNA inhibition of HIF-2α. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation, we demonstrated that HIF-2α can serve as transcriptional factor for HERV-E by binding with HIF response element (HRE) localized in the proviral 5′ long terminal repeat (LTR). Remarkably, the LTR was found to be hypomethylated only in HERV-E-expressing ccRCC while other tumors and normal tissues possessed a hypermethylated LTR preventing proviral expression. Taken altogether, these findings provide the first evidence that inactivation of a tumor suppressor gene can result in aberrant proviral expression in a human tumor and give insights needed for translational research aimed at boosting human immunity against antigenic components of this HERV-E."
https://openalex.org/W1988047265,"Limited data exist on the molecular mechanisms that govern skeletal muscle regeneration in humans. This study characterized the early molecular alterations in humans to eccentric contractions (ECs), a stimulus known to induce a muscle regenerative response. Thirty-five subjects completed 100 ECs of the knee extensors with 1 leg, and muscle biopsies were taken from both legs 3 h post-EC. The sample from the non-EC leg served as the control. We first conducted a well-powered transcriptomic screen and network analysis. Our screen identified significant changes in several transcripts with functions relating to inflammation, cell growth, and proliferation. Network analysis then identified the transcription factor NF-κB as a key molecular element affected by ECs. A transcription factor ELISA, using nuclear extracts from EC and control muscle samples, showed a 1.6-fold increase in NF-κB DNA binding activity following ECs. Immunohistochemical experiments localized the majority of NF-κB-positive nuclei to cells in the interstitium, which stained positive for the pericyte markers NG2 proteoglycan and alkaline phosphatase. Our results provide the first evidence of NF-κB activation in human muscle following ECs and suggest a novel role for muscle residing pericytes in the early adaptive response to ECs."
https://openalex.org/W2016910890,"Mel-18 has been implicated in several processes in tumor progression, in which the Akt pathway is involved as an important key molecular event. However, the function of Mel-18 in human cancers has not been fully established yet.

Mel-18 negatively regulated the HIF-1α expression and its target gene VEGF transcription during both normoxia and hypoxia. We demonstrated that Mel-18 regulated the HIF-1α expression and activity via the PI3K/Akt pathway. Loss of Mel-18 downregulated Phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) expression, consequently activating the PI3K/Akt/MDM2 pathway, and leading to an increase of HIF-1α protein level. Mel-18 modulated the HIF-1α transcriptional activity via regulating the cytoplasmic retention of FOXO3a, a downstream effector of Akt, and recruitment of HIF-1α/CBP complex to the VEGF promoter. Furthermore, our data shows that Mel-18 blocked tumor angiogenesis both in vitro and in vivo. Mel-18 overexpression inhibited in vitro tube formation in human umbilical endothelial cells (HUVECs). Xenografts in NOD/SCID mice derived from stably Mel-18 knocked down MCF7 human breast cancer cells showed increased tumor volume, microvessel density, and phospho-Akt and HIF-1α expression levels. In conclusion, our findings provide that Mel-18 is a novel regulator of tumor angiogenesis through regulating HIF-1α and its target VEGF expressions mediated by the PTEN/PI3K/Akt pathway, suggesting a new tumor-suppressive role of Mel-18 in human breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2171569159,"Brain parenchymal arterioles (PAs), but not pial arteries, undergo hypotrophic outward remodeling during pregnancy that involves peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ) activation. Relaxin, a peptide hormone produced during pregnancy, is involved in systemic and renal artery remodeling and activates PPARγ in vitro. Thus, we hypothesized that relaxin is involved in the selective outward remodeling of PAs through a PPARγ-dependent mechanism. Nonpregnant rats were treated with relaxin (4 μg/h, osmotic minipump), relaxin plus PPARγ inhibitor GW9662 (10 mg/kg/d), or vehicle for 10 d. Vascular function and structure were compared in isolated and pressurized middle cerebral arteries (MCAs) and PAs taken from the same animals. Relaxin treatment increased serum relaxin to the level of pregnancy (54 ng/ml) and increased passive wall thickness (hypertrophy; 70±5 vs. 54±4 μm in vehicle; P<0.05) and inner diameter (outward remodeling; 10.6±0.5 vs. 8.0±0.6 μm in vehicle; P<0.05) in PAs, but not in MCAs. This hypertrophic outward remodeling was prevented by GW9662 that had diameters (57±3 μm) and wall thickness (8.6±1.0 μm) similar to vehicle. GW9662 also prevented relaxin-induced changes in PPARγ target gene expression. These results suggest that relaxin produced during pregnancy may be partly responsible for selective remodeling of PAs during pregnancy through a mechanism involving PPARγ.—Chan, S.-L., Cipolla, M.

https://openalex.org/W1980870904,"Background Replication of mammalian genomes requires the activation of thousands of origins which are both spatially and temporally regulated by as yet unknown mechanisms. At the most fundamental level, our knowledge about the distribution pattern of origins in each of the chromosomes, among different cell types, and whether the physiological state of the cells alters this distribution is at present very limited. Methodology/Principal Findings We have used standard λ-exonuclease resistant nascent DNA preparations in the size range of 0.7–1.5 kb obtained from the breast cancer cell line MCF–7 hybridized to a custom tiling array containing 50–60 nt probes evenly distributed among genic and non-genic regions covering about 1% of the human genome. A similar DNA preparation was used for high-throughput DNA sequencing. Array experiments were also performed with DNA obtained from BT-474 and H520 cell lines. By determining the sites showing nascent DNA enrichment, we have localized several thousand origins of DNA replication. Our major findings are: (a) both array and DNA sequencing assay methods produced essentially the same origin distribution profile; (b) origin distribution is largely conserved (>70%) in all cell lines tested; (c) origins are enriched at the 5′ends of expressed genes and at evolutionarily conserved intergenic sequences; and (d) ChIP on chip experiments in MCF-7 showed an enrichment of H3K4Me3 and RNA Polymerase II chromatin binding sites at origins of DNA replication. Conclusions/Significance Our results suggest that the program for origin activation is largely conserved among different cell types. Also, our work supports recent studies connecting transcription initiation with replication, and in addition suggests that evolutionarily conserved intergenic sequences have the potential to participate in origin selection. Overall, our observations suggest that replication origin selection is a stochastic process significantly dependent upon local accessibility to replication factors."
https://openalex.org/W2090309575,"Polarized neurites (axons and dendrites) form the functional circuitry of the nervous system. Secreted guidance cues often control the polarity of neuron migration and neurite outgrowth by regulating ion channels. Here, we show that secreted semaphorin 3A (Sema3A) induces the neurite identity of Xenopus spinal commissural interneurons (xSCINs) by activating CaV2.3 channels (CaV2.3). Sema3A treatment converted the identity of axons of cultured xSCINs to that of dendrites by recruiting functional CaV2.3. Inhibition of Sema3A signalling prevented both the expression of CaV2.3 and acquisition of the dendrite identity, and inhibition of CaV2.3 function resulted in multiple axon-like neurites of xSCINs in the spinal cord. Furthermore, Sema3A-triggered cGMP production and PKG activity induced, respectively, the expression of functional CaV2.3 and the dendrite identity. These results reveal a mechanism by which a guidance cue controls the identity of neurites during nervous system development. Semaphorin 3A (Sema3A) is a key guidance cue for neuronal growth. Sema3A is now shown to facilitate the conversion of axons to dendrites by stimulating signalling through CaV2.3 calcium channels."
https://openalex.org/W1989718925,"Homeodomain-interacting protein kinase 2 (HIPK2) is an emerging player in cell response to genotoxic agents that senses damage intensity and contributes to the cell's choice between cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Phosphorylation of p53 at S46, an apoptosis-specific p53 posttranslational modification, is the most characterized HIPK2 function in response to lethal doses of ultraviolet (UV), ionizing radiation or different anticancer drugs, such as cisplatin, roscovitine and doxorubicin (DOX). Indeed, like p53, HIPK2 has been shown to contribute to the effectiveness of these treatments. Interestingly, p53-independent mechanisms of HIPK2-induced apoptosis were described for UV and tumor growth factor-β treatments; however, it is unknown whether these mechanisms are relevant for the responses to anticancer drugs. Because of the importance of the so-called 'p53-independent apoptosis and drug response' in human cancer chemotherapy, we asked whether p53-independent factor(s) might be involved in HIPK2-mediated chemosensitivity. Here, we show that HIPK2 depletion by RNA interference induces resistance to different anticancer drugs even in p53-null cells, suggesting the involvement of HIPK2 targets other than p53 in response to chemotherapy. In particular, we found that HIPK2 phosphorylates and promotes proteasomal degradation of ΔNp63α, a prosurvival ΔN isoform of the p53 family member, p63. Indeed, effective cell response to different genotoxic agents was shown to require phosphorylation-induced proteasomal degradation of ΔNp63α. In DOX-treated cells, we show that HIPK2 depletion interferes with ΔNp63α degradation, and expression of a HIPK2-resistant ΔNp63α-Δ390 mutant induces chemoresistance. We identify T397 as the ΔNp63α residue phosphorylated by HIPK2, and show that the non-phosphorylatable ΔNp63α-T397A mutant is not degraded in the face of either HIPK2 overexpression or DOX treatment. These results indicate ΔNp63α as a novel target of HIPK2 in response to genotoxic drugs."
https://openalex.org/W2153360248,"We studied the molecular forms of the GPI-anchored urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR-mEGFP) in the human embryo kidney (HEK293) cell membrane and demonstrated that the binding of the amino-terminal fragment (ATF) of urokinase plasminogen activator is sufficient to induce the dimerization of the receptor. We followed the association kinetics and determined precisely the dimeric stoichiometry of uPAR-mEGFP complexes by applying number and brightness (N&B) image analysis. N&B is a novel fluctuation-based approach for measuring the molecular brightness of fluorophores in an image time sequence in live cells. Because N&B is very sensitive to long-term temporal fluctuations and photobleaching, we have introduced a filtering protocol that corrects for these important sources of error. Critical experimental parameters in N&B analysis are illustrated and analyzed by simulation studies. Control experiments are based on mEGFP-GPI, mEGFP-mEGFP-GPI, and mCherry-GPI, expressed in HEK293. This work provides a first direct demonstration of the dimerization of uPAR in live cells. We also provide the first methodological guide on N&B to discern minor changes in molecular composition such as those due to dimerization events, which are involved in fundamental cell signaling mechanisms.—Hellriegel, C., Caiolfa, V.

https://openalex.org/W2055275116,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene that cause loss of function of the CFTR channel on the apical surface of epithelial cells. The major CF-causing mutation, F508del-CFTR, is misfolded, retained in the endoplasmic reticulum, and degraded. Small molecule corrector compounds have been identified using high throughput screens, which partially rescue the trafficking defect of F508del-CFTR, allowing a fraction of the mutant protein to escape endoplasmic reticulum retention and traffic to the plasma membrane, where it exhibits partial function as a cAMP-regulated chloride channel. A subset of such corrector compounds binds directly to the mutant protein, prompting the hypothesis that they rescue the biosynthetic defect by inducing improved protein conformation. We tested this hypothesis directly by evaluating the consequences of a corrector compound on the conformation of each nucleotide binding domain (NBD) in the context of the full-length mutant protein in limited proteolytic digest studies. Interestingly, we found that VRT-325 was capable of partially restoring compactness in NBD1. However, VRT-325 had no detectable effect on the conformation of the second half of the molecule. In comparison, ablation of the di-arginine sequence, R(553)XR(555) (F508del-KXK-CFTR), modified protease susceptibility of NBD1, NBD2, and the full-length protein. Singly, each intervention led to a partial correction of the processing defect. Together, these interventions restored processing of F508del-CFTR to near wild type. Importantly, however, a defect in NBD1 conformation persisted, as did a defect in channel activation after the combined interventions. Importantly, this defect in channel activation can be fully corrected by the addition of the potentiator, VX-770."
https://openalex.org/W2134834739,"RasGRP3, an activator for H-Ras, R-Ras and Ras-associated protein-1/2, has emerged as an important mediator of signaling downstream from receptor coupled phosphoinositide turnover in B and T cells. Here, we report that RasGRP3 showed a high level of expression in multiple human melanoma cell lines as well as in a subset of human melanoma tissue samples. Suppression of endogenous RasGRP3 expression in these melanoma cell lines reduced Ras-GTP formation as well as c-Met expression and Akt phosphorylation downstream from hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) or epidermal growth factor (EGF) stimulation. RasGRP3 suppression also inhibited cell proliferation and reduced both colony formation in soft agar and xenograft tumor growth in immunodeficient mice, demonstrating the importance of RasGRP3 for the transformed phenotype of the melanoma cells. Reciprocally, overexpression of RasGRP3 in human primary melanocytes altered cellular morphology, markedly enhanced cell proliferation and rendered the cells tumorigenic in a mouse xenograft model. Suppression of RasGRP3 expression in these cells inhibited downstream RasGRP3 responses and suppressed cell growth, confirming the functional role of RasGRP3 in the altered behavior of these cells. The identification of the role of RasGRP3 in melanoma highlights its importance, as a Ras activator, in the phosphoinositide signaling pathway in human melanoma and provides a new potential therapeutic target."
https://openalex.org/W2002656606,"Aging is thought to negatively affect multiple cellular processes including the ability to maintain chromosome stability. Chromosome instability (CIN) is a common property of cancer cells and may be a contributing factor to cellular transformation. The types of DNA aberrations that arise during aging before tumor development and that contribute to tumorigenesis are currently unclear. Mdm2, a key regulator of the p53 tumor suppressor and modulator of DNA break repair, is frequently overexpressed in malignancies and contributes to CIN. To determine the relationship between aging and CIN and the role of Mdm2, precancerous wild-type C57Bl/6 and littermate-matched Mdm2 transgenic mice at various ages were evaluated. Metaphase analyses of wild-type cells showed a direct correlation between age and increased chromosome and chromatid breaks, chromosome fusions and aneuploidy, but the frequency of polyploidy remained stable over time. Elevated levels of Mdm2 in precancerous mice increased both the numerical and the structural chromosomal abnormalities observed. Chromosome and chromatid breaks, chromosome fusions, aneuploidy and polyploidy were increased in older Mdm2 transgenic mice compared with wild-type littermates. Unexpectedly, chromosome fusions, aneuploidy and polyploidy rates in Mdm2 transgenic mice, but not chromosome and chromatid breaks, showed cooperation between Mdm2 overexpression and age. Notably, Mdm2 overexpression promoted gains in one or more chromosomes with age, while it did not affect the rate of chromosome loss. Therefore, aging increased specific forms of genomic instability, and elevated Mdm2 expression cooperated with aging to increase the likelihood of gaining certain chromosomal abnormalities of the kind thought to lead to cancer development."
https://openalex.org/W2070085807,"Among ion channels, only the nicotinic-receptor superfamily has evolved to generate both cation- and anion-selective members. Although other, structurally unrelated, neurotransmitter-gated cation channels exist, no other type of neurotransmitter-gated anion channel, and thus no other source of fast synaptic inhibitory signals, has been described so far. In addition to the seemingly straightforward electrostatic effect of the presence (in the cation-selective members) or absence (in the anion-selective ones) of a ring of pore-facing carboxylates, mutational studies have identified other features of the amino-acid sequence near the intracellular end of the pore-lining transmembrane segments (M2) that are also required to achieve the high charge selectivity shown by native channels. However, the mechanism underlying this more subtle effect has remained elusive and a subject of speculation. Here we show, using single-channel electrophysiological recordings to estimate the protonation state of native ionizable side chains, that anion-selective-type sequences favour whereas cation-selective-type sequences prevent the protonation of the conserved, buried basic residues at the intracellular entrance of the pore (the M2 0' position). We conclude that the previously unrecognized tunable charge state of the 0' ring of buried basic side chains is an essential feature of these channels' versatile charge-selectivity filter."
https://openalex.org/W1997378257,"Embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma (ERMS) is a tumor of the skeletal muscle in children and is frequently initiated by heterozygous germline mutations in the Hedgehog (Hh) receptor Patched1 (Ptch), both in humans and mice. Using a conditional knock-out strategy in Ptchflox/+ mice, we demonstrate that early embryonic stages are more susceptible to ERMS development than later stages and that cells normally not committed to undergo myogenesis at this stage represent the major source of ERMS. We found that deletion of a single copy of the Ptch allele at E9.5 using the ubiquitously active Rosa26CreERT2 resulted in a tumor incidence of 88% but reached only 44% and 12% when the Ptch allele was inactivated at E11.5 and E13.5, respectively. Induction of the Ptch mutation at E9.5 did also significantly shorten ERMS-free survival and increased tumor multiplicity compared with tumor induction at E11.5 and E13.5. Interestingly, we observed a more that 10-fold reduction of ERMS incidence when the Ptch mutation was specifically introduced in Myf5-expressing cells, which is the myogenic factor expressed in all muscle cells at E9.5. We conclude that Myf5-negative cells are more susceptible to ERMS development than Myf5-positive embryonic precursors. As the propensity to undergo tumorigenic transformation declined with age, concomitant with the increase of stably committed muscle cells, it seems likely that the Ptch mutation favors tumor formation in progenitor cells, which have not yet acquired a muscle cell fate."
https://openalex.org/W2088452786,"Here, we report the identification and characterization of a novel tyrosine phosphorylation site in the carboxy-terminal Src Homology 3 (SH3) (SH3C) domain of the Crk adaptor protein. Y251 is located in the highly conserved RT loop structure of the SH3C, a region of Crk involved in the allosteric regulation of the Abl kinase. Exploiting kinase assays to show that Y251 is phosphorylated by Abl in vitro, we generated affinity-purified antisera against phosphorylated Y251 in Crk and showed that Abl induces phosphorylation at Y251 in vivo, and that the kinetics of phosphorylation at Y251 and the negative regulatory Y221 site in vitro are similar. Y251 on endogenous Crk was robustly phosphorylated in chronic myelogenous leukemia cell lines and in A431 and MDA-MB-468 cells stimulated with epidermal growth factor. Using streptavidin-biotin pull downs and unbiased high-throughput Src Homology 2 (SH2) profiling approaches, we found that a pY251 phosphopeptide binds specifically to a subset of SH2 domains, including Abl and Arg SH2, and that binding of pY251 to Abl SH2 induces transactivation of Abl 1b. Finally, the Y251F Crk mutant significantly abrogates Abl transactivation in vitro and in vivo. These studies point to a yet unrealized positive regulatory role resulting from tyrosine phosphorylation of Crk, and identify a novel mechanism by which an adaptor protein activates a non-receptor tyrosine kinase by SH2 domain displacement."
https://openalex.org/W2079690313,"It is well known that the mu-opioid receptor (MOR) plays an important role in the rewarding properties of ethanol. However, it is less clear how chronic ethanol consumption affects MOR signaling. Here, we demonstrate that rats with prolonged voluntary ethanol consumption develop antinociceptive tolerance to opioids. Signaling through the MOR is controlled at many levels, including via the process of endocytosis. Importantly, agonists at the MOR that promote receptor endocytosis, such as the endogenous peptides enkephalin and β-endorphin, show a reduced propensity to promote antinociceptive tolerance than do agonists, like morphine, which do not promote receptor endocytosis. These observations led us to examine whether chronic ethanol consumption produced opioid tolerance by interfering with MOR endocytosis. Indeed, here we show that chronic ethanol consumption inhibits the endocytosis of MOR in response to opioid peptide. This loss of endocytosis was accompanied by a dramatic decrease in G protein coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2) protein levels after chronic drinking, suggesting that loss of this component of the trafficking machinery could be a mechanism by which endocytosis is lost. We also found that MOR coupling to G-protein was decreased in ethanol-drinking rats, providing a functional explanation for loss of opioid antinociception. Together, these results suggest that chronic ethanol drinking alters the ability of MOR to endocytose in response to opioid peptides, and consequently, promotes tolerance to the effects of opioids."
https://openalex.org/W2155065527,"Medulloblastoma is the most common malignant brain tumor in childhood, and development of targeted therapies is highly desired. Although the molecular mechanisms of malignant transformation are not fully understood, it is known that medulloblastomas may arise from cerebellar granule neuron precursors. The homeodomain transcription factor Barhl1 is known to regulate migration and survival of granule cell precursors, but its functional role in medulloblastoma is unknown. We show here that the expression of BARHL1 is significantly upregulated during human cerebellar development and in human medulloblastoma samples as compared with the normal adult cerebellum. We also detected high levels of Barhl1 expression in medulloblastomas of Math1-cre:SmoM2 mice, a mouse model for Sonic hedgehog-associated medulloblastomas that we developed previously. To investigate Barhl1 function in vivo during tumor development, we generated Barhl1(-/-)Math1-cre:SmoM2 mice. Interestingly, tumors that developed in these mice displayed increased mitotic activity and decreased neuronal differentiation. Moreover, survival of these mice was significantly decreased. Similarly, low expression of BARHL1 in human medulloblastoma cases was associated with a less favorable prognosis for patients. These results suggest that the expression of Barhl1 decelerates tumor growth both in human and in murine medulloblastomas and should be further investigated with respect to potential implications for individualized therapeutic strategies."

Non-receptor Syk tyrosine kinases are an important class among eukaryotic signaling enzymes (1van Oers N.S. Weiss A. Semin. Immunol. 1995; 7: 227-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The family consists of ZAP-70 and Syk, which are mostly found in T- and B-cells, respectively. These kinases help to propagate antigen-recognition signals initiated at the cell membrane. To do so, they first associate with the antigen-receptor complex and then phosphorylate downstream signaling and scaffolding proteins (2Au-Yeung B.B. Deindl S. Hsu L.Y. Palacios E.H. Levin S.E. Kuriyan J. Weiss A. Immunol. Rev. 2009; 228: 41-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Syk kinases are autoinhibited when isolated; activation follows their engagement of so-called ITAM motifs on the intracellular side of the antigen-receptor complex, through a molecular mechanism that is only partially understood. Consistent with their important cellular role, malfunction of Syk kinases underlies a range of immune system disorders (2Au-Yeung B.B. Deindl S. Hsu L.Y. Palacios E.H. Levin S.E. Kuriyan J. Weiss A.

Both ZAP-70 and Syk contain a tandem of SH2 modules, which inhibit the catalytic activity of the enzyme by assembling onto the kinase domain. The SH2 tandem (tSH2) 3The abbreviations used are: tSH2SH2 tandemnSH2N-terminal SH2cSH2C-terminal SH2r.m.s.d.root mean square deviation. also serves as the docking platform for ITAM motifs. These motifs consist of two repeats of sequence YXX(L/I) connected by a spacer of variable length; doubly phosphorylated ITAM motifs are thus suitable targets for SH2 tandems. Moreover, this dual interaction results in greater affinity, typically in the nanomolar range; that of individual SH2 domains is 2 orders of magnitude weaker (4Ottinger E.A. Botfield M.C.

Despite the high sequence identity of Syk and ZAP-70 (∼60%), they differ noticeably in the thermodynamics of ITAM recognition (5Bu J.Y. Shaw A.S. Chan A.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1995; 92: 5106-5110Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 6Folmer R.H. Geschwindner S. Xue Y. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 14176-14184Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 7Grucza R.A.

From a functional standpoint, this differentiation is likely related to the fact that Syk is more widely expressed, including in non-immune cells; the diversity of its ligands is therefore necessarily broader (3Mócsai A. Ruland J. Tybulewicz V.L. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2010; 10: 387-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar). However, in view of the similarity of the available tSH2 structures (9Hatada M.H. Lu X.

Chan A.C. Waksman G. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 281: 523-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), the molecular basis for this differentiation is not immediately clear. The molecular mechanism by which ITAM recognition induces kinase activation also remains to be clarified. The atomic structure of the ZAP-70 tSH2 assembled onto the kinase domain (Fig. 1A) reveals few structural differences when compared with the tSH2 alone (6Folmer R.H. Geschwindner S. Xue Y. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 14176-14184Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 11Deindl S. Kadlecek T.A. Brdicka T. Cao X. Weiss A. Kuriyan J. Cell. 2007; 129: 735-746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). By contrast, ITAM engagement entails a noticeable reorientation of the SH2 modules in isolated tandems (Fig. 1B) (9Hatada M.H. Lu X. Laird E.R. Green J. Morgenstern J.P. Lou M. Marr C.S. Phillips T.B. Ram M.K. Theriault K. et al.Nature. 1995; 377: 32-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). However, this rearrangement is not evidently incompatible with the tSH2-kinase interface as seen in the autoinhibited complex. Nevertheless, it has been hypothesized that catalytic activation is initiated by the disassembly of the tSH2 unit, in analogy with Src and Abl kinases (11Deindl S. Kadlecek T.A. Brdicka T. Cao X. Weiss A. Kuriyan J. Cell. 2007; 129: 735-746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Full activation is believed to entail subsequent phosphorylation (e.g. by Lck or ZAP-70 itself) of specific sites in the tSH2-kinase linker and the catalytic domain (2Au-Yeung B.B. Deindl S. Hsu L.Y. Palacios E.H. Levin S.E. Kuriyan J. Weiss A. Immunol. Rev. 2009; 228: 41-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Here, we present a detailed theoretical study of the mechanism of regulation of Syk kinases by tSH2 and ITAM motifs. Atomic resolution molecular dynamics simulations and large-scale free-energy calculations of a comprehensive set of molecular constructs (Fig. 2) have been employed to dissect the microscopic mechanism of ITAM recognition by the tSH2 and to discern the impact of this event on the stability of the autoinhibited complex. We begin with a comparative analysis of the SH2 domains in Syk and ZAP-70, individually and in tandem, and rationalize the greater specificity of the latter in terms of their distinct structural dynamics, resulting from key differences in their sequence. Building on these insights, and focusing on ZAP-70, we assess how the conformational free-energy landscape of the tSH2 is reshaped either by the stepwise engagement of ITAM or by docking onto the kinase domain. From this analysis, we conclude that a subtle competition exists between these two events, in reflection of a differential conformational flexibility of the inter-SH2 domain region. Thus, we provide direct evidence in support of the notion that ITAM motifs contribute to the propagation of ZAP-70-mediated signals by selectively recruiting disassembled, and hence uninhibited, tandem-kinase complexes. All simulation models (Fig. 2) were constructed on the basis of available crystal structures of Syk (1A81) or ZAP-70 (2OQ1, 1M61, and 2OZO). All ionizable groups were assigned their most probable protonation state at neutral pH. Crystallographic water molecules within 5 Å of protein atoms were preserved in each simulation system. Missing atoms and N/C-terminal residues were modeled in, resulting in the full 256-residue tSH2 structure of ZAP-70 or Syk. For the tSH2-kinase system, Phe315 and Phe319 (mutated to obtain stable crystals of the autoinhibited state (11Deindl S. Kadlecek T.A. Brdicka T. Cao X. Weiss A. Kuriyan J. Cell. 2007; 129: 735-746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar)) were replaced by wild-type Tyr315 and Tyr319, whereas missing regions of the core kinase domain were modeled on the basis of a complete crystal structure of the isolated domain. The tSH2ZAPITAM construct includes the co-crystallized 19-residue ITAM peptide; this corresponds to residues 69–87 of the T-cell receptor CD3-ζ chain. The analogous tSH2SykITAM construct includes the co-crystallized 18-residue ITAM peptide, which corresponds to residues 168–185 of the T-cell receptor CD3-∈ chain. Both ITAM peptides are doubly phosphorylated. In the tSH2ZAPΔITAM and tSH2SykΔITAM simulations, the ITAM peptide was removed from the complex and replaced by solvent. These simulations, however, start in the bound conformation of the tandem, in contrast to tSH2ZAPApo, which starts in the unbound state. In the tSH2ZAPcITAM and tSH2ZAPnITAM constructs, either the C-terminal or the N-terminal half of the ITAM peptide was retained, respectively, deleting the other half. In the tSH2ZAPApo+cITAM construct, the C-terminal half of the ITAM peptide was modeled into the N-terminal SH2 (nSH2) domain of the apo state crystal structure, through least-squares fitting the nSH2 domains in the ITAM-bound and apo structures. For the cSH2ZAP and cSH2Syk simulations, the ITAM peptide along with the first ∼150 residues of the tSH2 structure (i.e. the nSH2 and I-linker domains) were removed, resulting in a C-terminal SH2 construct including residues 158–256. Each of the tSH2 constructs was placed in a box of dimensions 9 × 9 × 9 nm3 and solvated with ∼22,000 water molecules (∼70,000 atoms in total). The tSH2-kinase system was placed in a box of dimensions 12 × 10 × 7 nm3 and solvated with ∼22,000 water molecules (∼80,000 atoms in total). The linker-helix constructs were placed in a box of dimensions 3 × 3 × 3 nm3 and solvated with ∼1,000 water molecules (∼3,000 atoms in total). The isolated cSH2 domains were placed in a truncated octahedral box of length ∼6.7 nm and solvated with ∼7,000 water molecules (∼22,000 atoms in total). Counter ions were added to neutralize each simulation box and to achieve a final salt concentration of 0.1 m NaCl. Each system was equilibrated over 2 ns, during which position restraints, applied to all non-hydrogen protein atoms, were gradually removed to relax the protein structure and solvent. The N and C termini of the linker, helical in both apo and ITAM-bound crystal structures, were subjected to weak helical restraints throughout the linker simulations to prevent unfolding. For the cSH2 constructs, additional 20-ns, restraint-free equilibrations were carried out. For every tSH2 and tSH2-kinase system, the solvation and equilibration steps were independently repeated 10 times to improve sampling. The final production simulations (25–35 ns) were also repeated ten times (Fig. 2). All simulations were carried out with NAMD 2.6 (12Phillips J.C. Braun R. Wang W. Gumbart J. Tajkhorshid E. Villa E. Chipot C. Skeel R.D. Kalé L. Schulten K. J. Comput. Chem. 2005; 26: 1781-1802Crossref PubMed Scopus (13178) Google Scholar), using the all-atom CHARMM22/CMAP force field (13MacKerell A.D. Bashford D. Bellott M. Dunbrack R.L. Evanseck J.D. Field M.J. Fischer S. Gao J. Guo H. Ha S. Joseph-McCarthy D. Kuchnir L. Kuczera K. Lau F.T.K. Mattos C. Michnick S. Ngo T. Nguyen D.T. Prodhom B. Reiher W.E.

The simulations were performed at constant temperature (298 K) and pressure (1 atm), using a Langevin thermostat and a Nosé-Hoover Langevin barostat, under periodic boundary conditions. Electrostatic interactions were computed using the particle-mesh-Ewald algorithm; the real-space electrostatic and van der Waals interactions were cut off at 14 Å. The free energy of gating of the cSH2 domain specificity pocket was calculated using the thermodynamic integration method. (A complete theoretical derivation is provided in the supplemental material.) That is,ΔGo→c≅∫01dλ〈U(λ)dλ〉λEq. 1 The potential energy function U(λ) was defined in terms of the r.m.s.d. of the N-peptide bond dihedral angles ϕi that describe the conformational change of the loop. That is,U(λ)=U+k2[r.m.s.d.(λ)]2Eq. 2 r.m.s.d.(λ)=1N∑i=1N[ϕi-ϕiλ]2Eq. 3 Here, ϕiλ denotes the set of intermediate values that each dihedral adopts in between the two end points, ϕi,o and ϕi,c. That is,ϕiλ=(1-λ)ϕi,o+λϕi,cEq. 4 The free-energy simulations were carried out following a stepwise protocol, initially including 21 intermediate λ steps, or windows; to resolve the energy barriers more precisely, 2–5 intermediate steps were added as necessary. The sampling time for each window was 4 ns following a preliminary 1-ns equilibration period. The initial configurations of the molecular system for each λ-window were either extracted from unbiased simulations of the cSH2 domains or produced from biased simulations targeting a specific value of λ. A force constant (k) of 2,400 kcal mol−1 radian−2 was used. Calculations with values of k between 600 and 5,000 kcal mol−1 radian−2 show that the results do not significantly depend on this choice. To better resolve the energetics of the open-to-closed gating transition, the calculation was actually carried out in two stages. First, the phi (ϕ) and psi (ψ) angles of residue 226 were varied to yield ΔG(ϕ226, ψ226). Subsequently, ψ224 and ϕ225 and were varied, whereas ϕ226 and ψ226 were constant, to obtain ΔG(ϕ225, ψ224). These stages correspond to supplemental Fig. S1, Transition #1 and Transition #2, respectively. The reference angles for the closed state EF-loop are those in the ZAP-70 apo crystal structure (ϕ225 = −84.8°, ψ224 = −24.1°, ϕ226 = 95.1°, ψ226 = −0.9°). The reference angles for the open state are those in the ITAM-bound crystal structure of ZAP-70 (ϕ225 = 67.2°, ψ224 = 121.0°, ϕ226 = −103.7°, ψ226 = −170.2°) or Syk (ϕ225 = 67.4°, ψ224 = 124.4°, ϕ226 = −107.0°, ψ226 = −169.4°). Two-dimensional umbrella-sampling simulations and the weighted histogram analysis method (as in Ref. 14Faraldo-Gómez J.D. Roux B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 13643-13648Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) were employed to calculate the free-energy landscape or potential of mean force underlying the transition from the apo to the ITAM-bound conformations of the ZAP-70 SH2 tandem. The bias potentials ξ1 and ξ2 were defined in terms of a difference of r.m.s.d. values, relative to the structure of either state of the tandem. That is,ξ=r.m.s.d.apo-r.m.s.d.boundEq. 5 The r.m.s.d. functions in ξ1 and ξ2 thus refer to two different sets of atoms; it is assumed that, collectively, these two sets are representative of the conformational change. The first set describes the relative arrangement of the SH2 domains, represented by their core secondary structure regions (supplemental Fig. S2); this includes the backbone atoms of residues 33–38, 45–51, 56–62, and 69–70 (nSH2 domain); residues 121–142 (inter-SH2 linker); and residues 186–191, 197–203, 208–214, and 221–222 (cSH2 domain). The second set describes the fold of the α-helix connecting the inter-SH2 domain to the cSH2 domain, namely the backbone atoms of residues 142–160. The bias potential is thereforeuj=k12(ξ1-ξ1,j0)2+k22(ξ2-ξ2,j0)2Eq. 6 The index j represents each of the umbrella-sampling simulations, or windows, in which the two-dimensional landscape is partitioned. ξ1,j0 and ξ2,j0 denote the reference values of the difference r.m.s.d. potentials in each of these windows. These were spaced in each dimension by 0.5 Å. Each window was simulated for 5 ns, from 3 to 5 times, using independent initial configurations of the simulation system. These configurations were extracted from unbiased sampling (initiated from both apo and ITAM-bound states) or generated from intervening 1-ns targeted simulations from adjacent umbrella-sampling windows. Three complete free-energy landscapes were derived and compared to estimate the statistical error (supplemental Fig. S5). It has been shown that the cSH2 domain of ZAP-70 has a weaker affinity for ITAM phosphopeptides than that of Syk (8Narula S.S. Yuan R.W. Adams S.E. Green O.M. Green J. Philips T.B. Zydowsky L.D. Botfield M.C. Hatada M. Laird E.R. et al.Structure. 1995; 3: 1061-1073Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). However, ZAP-70 cSH2 binds plain Tyr(P) (6Folmer R.H. Geschwindner S. Xue Y. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 14176-14184Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), indicating that its reduced affinity for ITAM is not related to Tyr(P) coordination. Instead, it appears to be due to the so-called specificity pocket, which is tuned to recognize a Leu or Ile three residues C-terminal of Tyr(P). Indeed, the crystal structure of the cSH2 domain in the apo tSH2 from ZAP-70 (6Folmer R.H. Geschwindner S. Xue Y. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 14176-14184Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) reveals a subtle conformational change in the EF-loop (residues 223–227, between the βE and βF strand) that seems to close this pocket when compared with the ITAM-bound state (Fig. 3, A and B). We noted that in many SH2 domains (15Lee C.H. Kominos D. Jacques S. Margolis B. Schlessinger J. Shoelson S.E. Kuriyan J. Structure. 1994; 2: 423-438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar), including the cSH2 of Syk, this pocket contains a tyrosine (Tyr239 in Syk) (Fig. 3C) that is replaced by Leu in ZAP-70 (Fig. 3B). We reasoned that this substitution might be important in determining the plasticity of the binding site, and hence, might influence ITAM recognition. To assess this hypothesis, we carried out free-energy simulations of the proposed gating process in the cSH2 domains of ZAP-70 and Syk (cSH2ZAP and cSH2Syk) (Fig. 3D). In ZAP-70, closure of the cSH2 specificity pocket appears to entail no significant energy cost (ΔG = 0.2 ± 0.3 kcal mol−1), suggesting that both open and closed states are populated in solution and at room temperature. These are separated by small kinetic barriers in the order of a few kBT, consistent with NMR measurements (6Folmer R.H. Geschwindner S. Xue Y. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 14176-14184Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Significantly, two structural water molecules that form a hydrogen-bonding network with main-chain atoms (9Hatada M.H. Lu X. Laird E.R. Green J. Morgenstern J.P. Lou M. Marr C.S. Phillips T.B. Ram M.K. Theriault K. et al.Nature. 1995; 377: 32-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar) are readily expelled upon pocket closure (Fig. 3B). In contrast, closure of the EF-loop in the canonical cSH2 domain of Syk is energetically disfavored (ΔG = 4.2 ± 0.7 kcal mol−1) (Fig. 3D). In the open state, the conserved Tyr239 mediates a protein-water hydrogen-bonding network not unlike that in ZAP-70 (Fig. 3C). However, the seemingly greater stability of this interaction network, conferred by the Tyr hydroxyl group, hinders the closure of the pocket (supplemental Fig. S1). The corresponding ratio of closed to open states, about 1:1,000, implies that the Syk cSH2 is likely to be constitutively open, in contrast to that of ZAP-70, which is much more prone to adopt a closed state. This conformational gating provides a rationale for the observation that the cSH2 domain of ZAP-70 binds phosphorylated ITAM fragments with significantly lower affinity than the nSH2 domain, in contrast to Syk, for which the affinity of either domain is comparable (6Folmer R.H. Geschwindner S. Xue Y. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 14176-14184Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Having established that the regulatory units in Syk and ZAP-70 differ at the single-domain level, we now compare the structural flexibility of the SH2 tandems. A differentiation in this regard has been proposed to explain their distinct specificity in regulatory stimuli (6Folmer R.H. Geschwindner S. Xue Y. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 14176-14184Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 7Grucza R.A. Fütterer K. Chan A.C. Waksman G. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5024-5033Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 9Hatada M.H. Lu X. Laird E.R. Green J. Morgenstern J.P. Lou M. Marr C.S. Phillips T.B. Ram M.K. Theriault K. et al.Nature. 1995; 377: 32-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar), but its molecular basis is presently unclear. A large reorientation of the SH2 domains is indeed associated with ITAM binding in ZAP-70 (6Folmer R.H. Geschwindner S. Xue Y. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 14176-14184Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 9Hatada M.H. Lu X. Laird E.R. Green J. Morgenstern J.P. Lou M. Marr C.S. Phillips T.B. Ram M.K. Theriault K. et al.Nature. 1995; 377: 32-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B), but for Syk, only the bound-state structure is known (10Fütterer K. Wong J. Grucza R.A. Chan A.C. Waksman G. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 281: 523-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). To assess whether the inherent plasticity of the Syk and ZAP-70 SH2 tandems differ, we carried out a series of molecular dynamics simulations of these tandems, both in the ITAM-bound state (tSH2ZAPITAM and tSH2SykITAM) and upon release of the ITAM peptide (tSH2ZAPΔITAM and tSH2SykΔITAM). For the bound-state simulations, the ∼20-residue ITAM peptides derive from the T-cell receptor CD3-ζ and -∈ chain, respectively. A total of 250 ns of simulation time were computed for each construct, split into 10 trajectories to diversify the exploration of conformational space. Taken individually, the nSH2, cSH2, and inter-SH2 domains were structurally constant in this time scale, in both Syk and ZAP-70 and for both bound and unbound states. For example, the r.m.s.d. of their core secondary structure regions remained within ∼0.5 Å of the corresponding crystal structures (supplemental Fig. S2). In tandem, the ITAM-bound constructs were also markedly stable (Fig. 4, a and c, and supplemental Fig. S2); we observed only small concerted motions of the SH2 domains, comparable with those seen in the unit cell of the Syk crystal, which contains four copies of the tandem (10Fütterer K. Wong J. Grucza R.A. Chan A.C. Waksman G. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 281: 523-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) (supplemental Fig. S3B). This stability correlates with the persistence of the Tyr(P) coordination network, which involves conserved side chains from both SH2 domains (Fig. 5A and supplemental Fig. S4A). Of particular interest is a lysine residue (Lys242 in ZAP-70, Lys227 in Syk) from the cSH2 domain, which provides a coordination contact for the nSH2-bound Tyr(P) at the SH2-SH2 interface (9Hatada M.H. Lu X. Laird E.R. Green J. Morgenstern J.P. Lou M. Marr C.S. Phillips T.B. Ram M.K. Theriault K. et al.Nature. 1995; 377: 32-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). According to our simulations, this interaction is unequivocally stable in both Syk and ZAP-70 (Fig. 5A and supplemental Fig. S4A). Therefore, we cannot concur with the notion that differences in Tyr(P) coordination at the SH2-SH2 interface underlie the more promiscuous regulation of Syk (10Fütterer K. Wong J. Grucza R.A. Chan A.C. Waksman G. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 281: 523-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar).FIGURE 5Representative simulation snapshots illustrating key interactions between ITAM and the SH2 tandem and between the SH2 domains (see also supplemental Fig. S4).

Upon disengagement of ITAM, the SH2 domains in the ZAP-70 tandem became rapidly uncoupled, leading to a concerted rearrangement toward the apo state (Fig. 4, a and b, and supplemental Fig. S3C). This is consistently observed in independent simulations, indicating that the conformational changes associated with ITAM binding and release likely follow a narrowly defined pathway. In contrast, the SH2 domains of Syk show a clear propensity to remain associated (Fig. 4, c and d, and supplemental Fig. S3D), driven by interdomain salt bridges and H-bonds (e.g. Arg40-Glu237 and Glu18-Lys242/Tyr241), not available in ZAP-70 because of polar-to-hydrophobic substitutions (Glu18 → Ala, Arg40 → Leu, and Tyr241 → Leu) (Fig. 5, A and C). Previous thermodynamic studies have indeed suggested that the unbound Syk tandem exists in equilibrium between two states, both competent for binding ITAM (7Grucza R.A. Fütterer K. Chan A.C. Waksman G. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5024-5033Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), and recent NMR data indicate that the ensemble of unliganded conformations is rather compact (16Zhang Y. Oh H. Burton R.A. Burgner J.W. Geahlen R.L. Post C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 11760-11765Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Our simulations show that this ensemble does indeed comprise a range of conformations in which the Syk SH2 domains remain associated, which may facilitate the recognition of a greater variety of ligands. This, combined with a constitutively open specificity pocket, likely contributes to a greater promiscuity in the regulation of the Syk kinase when compared with ZAP-70. That the structure and dynamics of the ZAP-70 SH2 tandem are influenced by ITAM binding is not unexpected; more informative, however, is the role of the individual Tyr(P) motifs in ITAM. To address this question, we calculated two series of simulations, amounting to 250 ns each, in which the ZAP-70 tandem starts in the ITAM-bound conformation, in complex with either an N-terminal (tSH2ZAPnITAM) or a C-terminal (tSH2ZAPcITAM) ITAM fragment. We observed a striking contrast in the tandem dynamics between these systems (Fig. 4, e and f). The tSH2ZAPnITAM construct, in which an ITAM fragment is bound to the cSH2 domain, exhibited a concerted shift toward the apo state (Fig. 4e) despite the fact that the nITAM fragment remains stably bound (supplemental Fig. S4C). Indeed, this conformational trend is very much comparable with that seen in the tSH2ZAPΔITAM simulations discussed above (Fig. 4b and Table 1). This observation suggests that partial binding of ITAM to the cSH2 domain is unlikely to affect the collective dynamics of the tandem, relative to the apo state. In contrast, the conformational sampling of tSH2ZAPcITAM construct (Fig. 4f) closely resembled that of the ITAM-bound state (Fig. 4a and Table 1), indicating that the interactions mediated by the C-terminal Tyr(P) at the interface between the SH2 domains (supplemental Fig. S4C) are sufficient to stabilize the ITAM-bound conformation.TABLE 1Correlation coefficients of the probability-density data in Fig. 4tSH2ZAPITAMtSH2ZAPApo+KintSH2ZAPApo0.020.56tSH2ZAPΔITAMtSH2SykITAMtSH2ZAPITAM0.030.45tSH2SykΔITAM0.220.50tSH2ZAPcITAMtSH2ZAPnITAMtSH2ZAPITAM0.960.16tSH2ZAPΔITAM0.100.88 Open table in a new tab Interestingly, the network of C-terminal Tyr(P) interactions in the ITAM and cITAM constructs is identical (Arg17, Arg37, Lys242, Tyr238), except that in the latter, Arg41 (from nSH2ZAP) competes with Lys242 and Tyr238 (from cSH2ZAP) for interactions with the ligand (Fig. 5A and supplemental Fig. S4C). This suggests that Arg41 may form a transient interaction with the Tyr(P) motif in a state in which the C-terminal half of ITAM binds to the N-terminal SH2 domain prior to any conformational change in the tandem.

https://openalex.org/W2093382374,"We have previously reported that the expression of antioxidative stress enzymes is upregulated by trans-hydroxytamoxifen (TOT) in breast epithelial cell lines providing protection against estrogen-induced DNA damage. This regulation involves Estrogen Receptor β (ERβ) recruitment to the Electrophile Response Element (EpRE) and a novel protein, human homolog of Xenopus gene which Prevents Mitotic Catastrophe (hPMC2). We have also demonstrated that ERβ and hPMC2 are required for TOT-dependent recruitment of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP-1) and Topoisomerase IIβ (Topo IIβ) to the EpRE. Sequence analysis reveals that the C-terminus of hPMC2 encodes a putative exonuclease domain. Using in vitro kinetic assays, we found that hPMC2 is a 3'-5' non-processive exonuclease that degrades both single-stranded and double-stranded substrates. Mutation of two conserved carboxylate residues drastically reduced the exonuclease activity of hPMC2, indicating the relative importance of the catalytic residues. Western blot analysis of breast cancer cell lines for Quinone Reductase (QR) levels revealed that the intrinsic exonuclease activity of hPMC2 was required for TOT-induced QR upregulation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays also indicated that hPMC2 was involved in the formation of strand breaks observed with TOT treatment and is specific for the EpRE-containing region of the QR gene. We also determined that the transcription factor NF-E2-related factor-2 (Nrf2) is involved in the specificity of hPMC2 for the EpRE. In addition, we determined that the catalytic activity of hPMC2 is required for repair of abasic sites that result from estrogen-induced DNA damage. Thus, our study provides a mechanistic basis for transcriptional regulation by hPMC2 and provides novel insights into its role in cancer prevention."
https://openalex.org/W2123375447,"Genes under the control of the cyclooxygenase-2 (Cox-2), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (Her-2), and survivin promoters were constructed and delivered to murine and human carcinoma cells. It was found that (P)Cox-2-driven reporter expression was strong and correlated well with endogenous Cox-2 levels, while (P)Her-2 and (P)survivin yielded poor results, consistent with the three distinct expression mechanisms used by cancer cells to overexpress the endogenous versions of the selected genes. The (P)Cox-2 was then used to drive the expression of caspase genes both in vitro and in vivo to bring about targeted apoptosis of carcinoma cells successfully. The results led to the following conclusions. 1) When selecting a promoter/enhancer for expression-targeted gene delivery, it is not enough to perform a microarray on some tumor tissue and select the control element associated with the greatest amount of gene up-regulation vs. normal controls. The mechanism of expression for the particular gene should be taken into account to prevent lengthy and costly research trials. 2) When overexpression is due to activator binding, a predictive model based on endogenous gene expression levels, overall cell transfectability, and cell doubling rates can be used to predict expression-targeted gene delivery outcomes with significant accuracy."
