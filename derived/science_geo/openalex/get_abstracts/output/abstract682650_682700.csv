https://openalex.org/W3205257469,"During the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic, there was an unusually high submission rate of scholarly articles. Given that most academics were forced to work from home, the competing demands for familial duties may have penalized the scientific productivity of women. To test this hypothesis, we looked at submitted manuscripts and peer review activities for all Elsevier journals between February and May 2018-2020, including data on over 5 million authors and referees. Results showed that during the first wave of the pandemic, women submitted proportionally fewer manuscripts than men. This deficit was especially pronounced among more junior cohorts of women academics. The rate of the peer-review invitation acceptance showed a less pronounced gender pattern with women taking on a greater service responsibility for journals, except for health & medicine, the field where the impact of COVID-19 research has been more prominent. Our findings suggest that the first wave of the pandemic has created potentially cumulative advantages for men."
https://openalex.org/W3205135778,"The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically shaped higher education and seen the distinct rise of e-learning as a compulsory element of the modern educational landscape. Accordingly, this study highlights the factors which have influenced how students perceive their academic performance during this emergency changeover to e-learning. The empirical analysis is performed on a sample of 10,092 higher education students from 10 countries across 4 continents during the pandemic's first wave through an online survey. A structural equation model revealed the quality of e-learning was mainly derived from service quality, the teacher's active role in the process of online education, and the overall system quality, while the students' digital competencies and online interactions with their colleagues and teachers were considered to be slightly less important factors. The impact of e-learning quality on the students' performance was strongly mediated by their satisfaction with e-learning. In general, the model gave quite consistent results across countries, gender, study fields, and levels of study. The findings provide a basis for policy recommendations to support decision-makers incorporate e-learning issues in the current and any new similar circumstances."
https://openalex.org/W3207655159,"Background As war and famine are population level stressors that have been historically linked to menstrual cycle abnormalities, we hypothesized that the COVID-19 pandemic could similarly affect ovulation and menstruation among women. Methodology We conducted a retrospective cohort study examining changes in ovulation and menstruation among women using the Natural Cycles mobile tracking app. We compared de-identified cycle data from March-September 2019 (pre-pandemic) versus March-September 2020 (during pandemic) to determine differences in the proportion of users experiencing anovulation, abnormal cycle length, and prolonged menses, as well as population level changes in these parameters, while controlling for user-reported stress during the pandemic. Findings We analyzed data from 214,426 cycles from 18,076 app users, primarily from Great Britain (29.3%) and the United States (22.6%). The average user was 33 years of age; most held at least a university degree (79.9%). Nearly half (45.4%) reported more pandemic-related stress. Changes in average cycle and menstruation lengths were not clinically significant, remaining at 29 and 4 days, respectively. Approximately 7.7% and 19.5% of users recorded more anovulatory cycles and abnormal cycle lengths during the pandemic, respectively. Contrary to expectation, 9.6% and 19.6% recorded fewer anovulatory cycles and abnormal cycle lengths, respectively. Women self-reporting more (32.0%) and markedly more (13.6%) stress during the pandemic were not more likely to experience cycle abnormalities. Conclusions The COVD-19 pandemic did not induce population-level changes to ovulation and menstruation among women using a mobile app to track menstrual cycles and predict ovulation. While some women experienced abnormalities during the pandemic, this proportion was smaller than that observed prior to the pandemic. As most app users in this study were well-educated women over the age of 30 years, and from high-income countries, their experience of the COVID-19 pandemic might differ in ways that limit the generalizability of these findings."
https://openalex.org/W3207235368,"During the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, U.S. conservative politicians and the media downplayed the risk of both contracting COVID-19 and the effectiveness of recommended health behaviors. Health behavior theories suggest perceived vulnerability to a health threat and perceived effectiveness of recommended health-protective behaviors determine motivation to follow recommendations. Accordingly, we predicted that-as a result of politicization of the pandemic-politically conservative Americans would be less likely to enact recommended health-protective behaviors. In two longitudinal studies of U.S. residents, political conservatism was inversely associated with perceived health risk and adoption of health-protective behaviors over time. The effects of political orientation on health-protective behaviors were mediated by perceived risk of infection, perceived severity of infection, and perceived effectiveness of the health-protective behaviors. In a global cross-national analysis, effects were stronger in the U.S. (N = 10,923) than in an international sample (total N = 51,986), highlighting the increased and overt politicization of health behaviors in the U.S."
https://openalex.org/W3207540548,"Understanding and monitoring the epidemiological time delay dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 infection provides insights that are key to discerning changes in the phenotype of the virus, the demographics impacted, the efficacy of treatment, and the ability of the health service to manage large volumes of patients. This paper analyses how the pandemic has evolved in the United Kingdom through the temporal changes to the epidemiological time delay distributions for clinical outcomes. Using the most complete clinical data presently available, we have analysed, through a doubly interval censored Bayesian modelling approach, the time from infection to a clinical outcome. Across the pandemic, for the periods that were defined as epidemiologically distinct, the modelled mean ranges from 8.0 to 9.7 days for infection to hospitalisation, 10.3 to 15.0 days for hospitalisation to death, and 17.4 to 24.7 days for infection to death. The time delay from infection to hospitalisation has increased since the first wave of the pandemic. A marked decrease was observed in the time from hospitalisation to death and infection to death at times of high incidence when hospitals and ICUs were under the most pressure. There is a clear relationship between age groups that is indicative of the youngest and oldest demographics having the shortest time delay distributions before a clinical outcome. A statistically significant difference was found between genders for the time delay from infection to hospitalisation, which was not found for hospitalisation to death. The results by age group indicate that younger demographics that require clinical intervention for SARS-CoV-2 infection are more likely to require earlier hospitalisation that leads to a shorter time to death, which is suggestive of the largely more vulnerable nature of these individuals that succumb to infection. The distinction found between genders for exposure to hospitalisation is revealing of gender healthcare seeking behaviours."

Previous estimates indicated global preterm birth rate of 10.6% (14.8 million neonates) in 2014. We aim to update preterm birth estimates at global, regional, and national levels for the period 2010 to 2019.Preterm birth is defined as a live birth occurring before 37 completed gestational weeks, or <259 days since a woman's last menstrual period. National administrative data sources for WHO Member States with facility birth rates of ≥80% in the most recent year for which data is available will be searched. Administrative data identified for these countries will be considered if ≥80% of UN estimated live births include gestational age information to define preterm birth. For countries without eligible administrative data, a systematic review of studies will be conducted. Research studies will be eligible if the reported outcome is derived from an observational or intervention study conducted at national or sub-national level in population- or facility-based settings. Risk of bias assessments will focus on gestational age measurement method and coverage, and inclusion of special subgroups in published estimates. Covariates for inclusion will be selected a priori based on a conceptual framework of plausible associations with preterm birth, data availability, and quality of covariate data across many countries and years. Global, regional and national preterm birth rates will be estimated using a Bayesian multilevel-mixed regression model.Accurate measurement of preterm birth is challenging in many countries given incomplete or unavailable data from national administrative sources, compounded by limited gestational age assessment during pregnancy to define preterm birth. Up-to-date modelled estimates will be an important resource to measure the global burden of preterm birth and to inform policies and programs especially in settings with a high burden of neonatal mortality.PROSPERO registration: CRD42021237861."
https://openalex.org/W3206972514,"Music listening can be an effective strategy for regulating affect, leading to positive well-being. However, it is unclear how differences in disposition and personality can impact music's affective benefits in response to acute and major real-world stressful events. The COVID-19 pandemic provides a unique opportunity to study how music is used to cope with stress, loss, and unease across the world. During the first month of the spread of the COVID pandemic, we used an online survey to test if people from four different countries used music to manage their emotions during quarantine and if the functions of music depended on empathy, anxiety, depression, or country of residence. We found a positive relationship between the use of music listening for affect regulation and current well-being, particularly for participants from India. While people with stronger symptoms of depression and anxiety used music differently, the end result was still a positive change in affect. Our findings highlight the universality of music's affective potency and its ability to help people manage an unprecedented life stressor."
https://openalex.org/W3207075209,"What have been the causes and consequences of technological evolution in world history? In particular, what propels innovation and diffusion of military technologies, details of which are comparatively well preserved and which are often seen as drivers of broad socio-cultural processes? Here we analyze the evolution of key military technologies in a sample of pre-industrial societies world-wide covering almost 10,000 years of history using Seshat: Global History Databank. We empirically test previously speculative theories that proposed world population size, connectivity between geographical areas of innovation and adoption, and critical enabling technological advances, such as iron metallurgy and horse riding, as central drivers of military technological evolution. We find that all of these factors are strong predictors of change in military technology, whereas state-level factors such as polity population, territorial size, or governance sophistication play no major role. We discuss how our approach can be extended to explore technological change more generally, and how our results carry important ramifications for understanding major drivers of evolution of social complexity."
https://openalex.org/W3206659012,"This paper empirically studies the relationship among inclusive finance, industrial structure upgrading and farmers' income, using the panel data of 28 provinces in China from 2006 to 2016.The research finds that inclusive finance can significantly promote the increase of farmers' income. Moreover, the Upgrading of Industry Structure (UIS) is the intermediary mechanism of inclusive finance to promote the increase of farmers' income, and this intermediary mechanism is heterogeneous among farmers with different income levels. Finally, the promotion effect of the UIS on farmers' income is affected by the threshold effect of inclusive finance. Compared with the development level of low inclusive finance, the promotion effect of the UIS on farmers' income is stronger under the development level of high inclusive finance. According to the results of empirical analysis, we suggest that the development strategy of inclusive finance should aim at the industrial development in rural areas, promote the organic connection between farmers and modern agricultural industry, and drive farmers to increase their income through the transformation and upgrading of rural industries."
https://openalex.org/W3205164130,"The General Organization of the Veterinary Services in Egypt has adopted a sheeppox vaccination policy to control lumpy skin disease (LSD) in cattle. Over the course of the last two years, recurrent outbreaks were reported, with animals showing severe clinical signs and consequentially higher fatalities than that of cases reported in previous LSD outbreaks. A total of 1050 cattle showing typical clinical signs suggestive of LSD were clinically and pathologically investigated during 2017-2018. Skin nodules were collected and lumpy skin disease virus (LSDV) was screened in collected skin samples using PCR for the RPO-30 gene. Furthermore, the entire P32 protein coding gene was sequenced. Histopathology and immunohistochemistry of the skin nodules were also conducted. The obtained results showed an overall mortality rate of 6.86%. LSDV was confirmed in all the examined nodules as evidenced by immunohistochemistry and positive PCR amplification of the RPO30 gene. Sequencing analysis of the P32 gene revealed a highly conserved nature and genetic stability of the LSDV. The results of the present study show that the current vaccination protocol was not effective for a multitude of reasons. These results also serve as evidence for a strong recommendation of an amendment of homologous vaccine use aside from a complete coverage of cattle populations in order to reduce the incidence of LSD among cattle population in Egypt."
https://openalex.org/W3206800966,"Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease. Pathophysiological similarities between chronic infections and atherosclerosis triggered interests between these conditions. The seroepidemiological study showed that Helicobacter pylori strains that express cytotoxin-associated gene A (CagA), an oncoprotein and a major virulence factor, was positively correlated with atherosclerosis and related clinical events. Nevertheless, the underlying mechanism is poorly understood. In this study, the seroprevalence of infection by H. pylori and by strains express CagA assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) showed that the prevalence of CagA strains rather than H. pylori in patients was positively correlated with atherogenesis. Correspondingly, we found that CagA augmented the growth of plaque of ApoE-/- mice in the early stage of atherosclerosis and promoted the expression of adhesion molecules and inflammatory cytokines in mouse aortic endothelial cells (MAECs). Mechanistically, both si-NLRP3 and si-IL-1β mitigated the promoting effect of CagA on the inflammatory activation of HAECs. In vivo, the inhibition of NLRP3 by MCC950 significantly attenuated the promoting effect of CagA on plaque growth of ApoE-/- mice. We also propose NLRP3 as a potential therapeutic target for CagA-positive H. pylori infection-related atherosclerosis and emphasize the importance of inflammation in atherosclerosis pathology."
https://openalex.org/W3206703008,"Rapid advances in machine learning and related techniques have increased optimism about self-driving cars, autonomous surgery, and other uses of artificial intelligence (AI). But adoption of these technologies is not simply a matter of breakthroughs in the design and training of algorithms. Regulators around the world will have to make a litany of choices about law and policy surrounding AI. To advance knowledge of how they will make these choices, we draw on a unique survey pool-690 local officials in the United States-a representative sample of U.S. local officials. These officials will make many of the decisions about AI adoption, from government use to regulation, given the decentralized structure of the United States. The results show larger levels of support for autonomous vehicles than autonomous surgery. Moreover, those that used ridesharing apps prior to the COVID-19 pandemic are significantly more supportive of autonomous vehicles. We also find that self-reported familiarity with AI is correlated with increased approval of AI uses in a variety of areas, including facial recognition, natural disaster impact planning, and even military surveillance. Related, those who expressed greater opposition to AI adoption also appear more concerned about trade-offs between privacy and information and bias in algorithms. Finally, the explanatory logic used by respondents varies based on gender and prior experience with AI, which we demonstrate with quantitative text analysis."
https://openalex.org/W3126433517,"Restrictions during the COVID-19 pandemic may affect the lives of pet animals. We aimed to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the welfare of pet cats across countries, as well as the owners' experience in relation to their cat(s). An online survey containing 21 questions was distributed internationally. Questions were related to information about the cat and its behaviour and health, changes in the household due to the pandemic, and how the owner related to the cat. The survey was completed by 324 respondents from 25 different countries. The survey showed that keeping pet cats during the COVID-19 pandemic did not create problems for the owners, except some difficulties in acquiring veterinary care. The majority (67.3%) of respondents reported no changes in their cats' behaviour. When behavioural changes were reported, they were mostly of a positive nature. Owners who took more measures in relation to the cat to prevent the spread of the virus, e.g., reduced contact, were 1.8 times more likely to report changes in the behaviour of their cats but also 3.8 times more likely to report difficulties related to the care of the cat during the pandemic. Two-third of the respondents indicated a reduction of their own psychological tensions due to having a cat during the pandemic. We concluded that the welfare of pet cats, as reported by the owners, was not adversely affected by the pandemic and the human-cat interaction had positive effects on the owners during the lockdown."
https://openalex.org/W3206724271,"This paper analyses the female gender as a one of the factors that may influence product and process innovativeness of small enterprises. The data discussed come from an empirical study of 1017 small enterprises from the Kujawsko-pomorskie region in central-northern Poland. The theoretical framework suggests three areas of factors that may influence small enterprises innovativeness: the entrepreneur’s gender, innovation management capability, and firm characteristics. The results of the study suggest that the female gender of the entrepreneur has a positive impact on the product and process innovativeness of small enterprises. In the group of small enterprises managed by female entrepreneurs the chances of introducing product innovation are higher by 83.7%, process innovation by 56%, and product and process innovation together by 82.1%."
https://openalex.org/W3206043271,"Obesity and metabolic disorders caused by energy surplus pose an increasing concern within the global population. Brown adipose tissue (BAT) dissipates energy through mitochondrial non-shivering thermogenesis, thus representing a powerful agent against obesity. Here we explore the novel role of a mitochondrial outer membrane protein, LETM1-domain containing 1 (LETMD1), in BAT. We generated a knockout (Letmd1KO ) mouse model and analyzed BAT morphology, function and gene expression under various physiological conditions. While the Letmd1KO mice are born normally and have normal morphology and body weight, they lose multilocular brown adipocytes completely and have diminished mitochondrial abundance, DNA copy number, cristae structure, and thermogenic gene expression in the intrascapular BAT, associated with elevated reactive oxidative stress. In consequence, the Letmd1KO mice fail to maintain body temperature in response to acute cold exposure without food and become hypothermic within 4 h. Although the cold-exposed Letmd1KO mice can maintain body temperature in the presence of food, they cannot upregulate expression of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) and convert white to beige adipocytes, nor can they respond to adrenergic stimulation. These results demonstrate that LETMD1 is essential for mitochondrial structure and function, and thermogenesis of brown adipocytes."

In this study, we describe the clinical characteristics of obese children and adolescents with elevated morning serum cortisol levels and the relationship between the cortisol levels and components of the metabolic syndrome.Retrospective medical record review study of children aged 4 to 18 years with overweight or obesity seen for obesity management in the Pediatric Obesity Clinic of the UZ Brussel between 2013 and 2015.A total of 234 children (99 boys and 135 girls) with overweight (BMI z-score > 1.3) without underlying endocrine or genetic conditions were included. Mean (SD) age was 10.1 (2.8) years, BMI SD-score 2.5 (0.6), and body fat percentage 37% (7.9). Serum fasting cortisol levels were elevated (>180 μg/L) in 49 children, normal (62-180 μg/L) in 168, and decreased (<62 μg/L) in 12. Serum fasting cortisol was not significantly correlated with gender, age, or degree of adiposity. But correlated significantly with fasting glucose (Rs = 0.193; p < 0.005), triglycerides (Rs = 0. 143; p < 0.05), fibrinogen (Rs = 0.144; p < 0.05) and leptin levels (Rs = 0.145; p < 0.05). After adjustment for serum insulin and leptin, the correlation between serum cortisol and fasting glucose remained significant.Elevated morning serum cortisol levels were found in 20% of overweight or obese children and adolescents, irrespective of the degree of adiposity, and were associated with higher fasting glucose, irrespective of underlying insulin resistance. The long-term cardiometabolic consequences of hypercortisolemia in childhood obesity needs further study."
https://openalex.org/W3206496513,"High accuracy has been reported in deep learning classification for amyloid brain scans, an important factor in Alzheimer's disease diagnosis. However, the possibility of overfitting should be considered, as this model is fitted with sample data. Therefore, we created and evaluated an [18F]Florbetaben amyloid brain positron emission tomography (PET) scan classification model with a Dong-A University Hospital (DAUH) dataset based on a convolutional neural network (CNN), and performed external validation with the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative dataset. Spatial normalization, count normalization, and skull stripping preprocessing were performed on the DAUH and external datasets. However, smoothing was only performed on the external dataset. Three types of models were used, depending on their structure: Inception3D, ResNet3D, and VGG3D. After training with 80% of the DAUH dataset, an appropriate model was selected, and the rest of the DAUH dataset was used for model evaluation. The generalization potential of the selected model was then validated using the external dataset. The accuracy of the model evaluation for Inception3D, ResNet3D, and VGG3D was 95.4%, 92.0%, and 97.7%, and the accuracy of the external validation was 76.7%, 67.1%, and 85.3%, respectively. Inception3D and ResNet3D were retrained with the external dataset; then, the area under the curve was compared to determine the binary classification performance with a significance level of less than 0.05. When external validation was performed again after fine tuning, the performance improved to 15.3%p for Inception3D and 16.9%p for ResNet3D. In [18F]Florbetaben amyloid brain PET scan classification using CNN, the generalization potential can be seen through external validation. When there is a significant difference between the model classification performance and the external validation, changing the model structure or fine tuning the model can help improve the classification performance, and the optimal model can also be found by collaborating through a web-based open platform."
https://openalex.org/W3207882030,"Hemorrhagic shock (HS) is common in clinical emergencies, leading to millions of deaths each year globally. CD226 is a costimulatory adhesion molecule expressed on both immune cells and endothelial cells (ECs) to regulate their metabolic activity and function. As endothelial dysfunction occurs after HS, the roles CD226 plays in vascular EC metabolism were investigated. CD226fl/fl Tekcre mice were adopted to achieve vascular EC-specific knockout of CD226, and subjected to HS modelling. Serum levels of crucial intermediate metabolites were evaluated through liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis. Human umbilical vein ECs (HUVECs) were used to study the effects of CD226 under hypoxia in vitro. Seahorse analysis evaluated the cellular glycolysis and mitochondria bioenergetics. Results showed that CD226 deficiency in vascular ECs alleviated HS-induced intestinal damage and inflammatory response in mice. Animal studies indicated an improved energy metabolism when CD226 was knocked out in ECs after HS, as evidenced by enhanced glutamine-glutamate metabolism and decreased lactic acid levels. Glut-1 was upregulated in mouse vascular ECs after HS and HUVECs under hypoxia, combined with decreased CD226. Moreover, HUVECs with CD226 knockdown exhibited relieved mitochondrial damage and early apoptosis under hypoxia, whereas CD226 overexpression showed opposite effects. Seahorse analysis showed that downregulated CD226 significantly increased mitochondrial ATP production and glucose uptake in HUVECs under hypoxia. Additionally, Erk/PHD2 signaling-mediated HIF-1α/Glut-1 and HIF-2α/ASCT2 pathways were involved in CD226 regulation on HUVEC glutaminolysis after hypoxia. Hence, CD226 deficiency promotes bypass energy supply to vascular ECs under ischemic or hypoxic stress, to ameliorate the stress-mediated metabolic disturbance."
https://openalex.org/W3206227481,"Antibiotic resistance is one of the biggest threats to global public health. Misuse of antibiotics has never been investigated on a nationwide scale among the general public in Malaysia. This study aimed to identify sociodemographic and knowledge factors associated with inappropriate use of antibiotics in the Malaysian context to inform the development of interventions to mitigate inappropriate antibiotic use. We conducted computer-assisted telephone interviews (CATI) between June 2019 and December 2019. The telephone numbers were randomly generated from the electronic residential telephone directory of all 13 states and 3 Federal Territories in Malaysia. The survey consisted of questions on demographics, knowledge about antibiotics and antibiotic resistance (53 items), and practices of antibiotic use (16 questions). A total of 864 complete responses were received. Pronounced erroneous beliefs that antibiotics are effective against infections caused by viruses and that antibiotics can speed up recovery from coughs and colds were evident. The proportions that were aware of the terms ‘drug resistance’, ‘antimicrobial resistance’, and ‘superbugs’ were low. The mean and standard deviation (SD) for the antibiotic knowledge score was 23.7 (SD ±9.25; range 0 to 50) out of a possible score of 52. Regarding antibiotic practices, a considerable proportion reported non-adherence to recommended doses. The mean and SD for the antibiotic practices score was 37.9 (SD ± 6.5; range 17 to 47) out of a possible score of 48. Participants who earned an average monthly household income of MYR1001-3000 (OR 1.61, 95% CI 1.04–2.50) were more likely to report higher antibiotic practice scores than those with &lt;MYR1000. Participants with tertiary education attainment reported higher antibiotic practice scores (OR 1.99; 95%CI 1.02–3.91) than those with primary school and below. High antibiotic knowledge scores (OR 3.94; 95% CI 2.71–5.73) were associated with higher antibiotic practice scores. Inappropriate antibiotic use is influenced by demographics and antibiotic knowledge. This study calls for education interventions focused on the lower socio-economic status population to increase awareness and to promote appropriate antibiotic use."

We compared the diagnostic yield of EUS and ERCP-based tissue sampling in intrinsic biliary strictures without extrinsic mass outside the bile duct.A total of 85 patients who underwent ERCP and EUS for diagnosis of suspected biliary strictures confined to the bile duct were analyzed retrospectively at Samsung Medical Center, Seoul, Korea, between 2010 and 2018.Seventy-one patients were diagnosed with malignancy and 14 patients were diagnosed with benign strictures. EUS-based tissue sampling was more sensitive and accurate than ERCP-based tissue sampling (p = 0.038). The overall sensitivity and accuracy were 67.6% (95% confidence interval (CI) 56.1-77.3) and 72.9% (95% CI 62.7-81.2) for ERCP-based sampling, and 80.3% (95% CI 69.6-87.9) and 83.5% (95% CI 74.2-89.9) for EUS-based sampling, respectively. EUS-based sampling was superior to ERCP-based sampling in distal bile duct strictures (accuracy: 87.0% vs. 72.5%, p = 0.007), but not in perihilar strictures. In cases without intraductal mass, EUS-based tissue sampling was also superior to ERCP-based sampling (accuracy: 83.3% vs. 69.7%, p = 0.029), but not in cases with mass.EUS-based tissue sampling was superior to ERCP-based method in intrinsic biliary stricture with no mass outside the bile duct, particularly in those without intraductal mass or those with strictures located in distal bile duct. Therefore, EUS-based sampling should be considered for making a pathological diagnosis of suspected distal bile duct strictures even in lesions without definite mass."
https://openalex.org/W3207928532,"Although genes carry information, proteins are the main role player in providing all the functionalities of a living organism. Massive amounts of different proteins involve in every function that occurs in a cell. These amino acid sequences can be hierarchically classified into a set of families and subfamilies depending on their evolutionary relatedness and similarities in their structure or function. Protein characterization to identify protein structure and function is done accurately using laboratory experiments. With the rapidly increasing huge amount of novel protein sequences, these experiments have become difficult to carry out since they are expensive, time-consuming, and laborious. Therefore, many computational classification methods are introduced to classify proteins and predict their functional properties. With the progress of the performance of the computational techniques, deep learning plays a key role in many areas. Novel deep learning models such as DeepFam, ProtCNN have been presented to classify proteins into their families recently. However, these deep learning models have been used to carry out the non-hierarchical classification of proteins. In this research, we propose a deep learning neural network model named DeepHiFam with high accuracy to classify proteins hierarchically into different levels simultaneously. The model achieved an accuracy of 98.38% for protein family classification and more than 80% accuracy for the classification of protein subfamilies and sub-subfamilies. Further, DeepHiFam performed well in the non-hierarchical classification of protein families and achieved an accuracy of 98.62% and 96.14% for the popular Pfam dataset and COG dataset respectively."
https://openalex.org/W3205882059,"Understanding the rates and patterns of tidal wetland elevation changes relative to sea-level is essential for understanding the extent of potential wetland loss over the coming years. Using an enhanced and more flexible modeling framework of an ecosystem model (WARMER-2), we explored sea-level rise (SLR) impacts on wetland elevations and carbon sequestration rates through 2100 by considering plant community transitions, salinity effects on productivity, and changes in sediment availability. We incorporated local experimental results for plant productivity relative to inundation and salinity into a species transition model, as well as site-level estimates of organic matter decomposition. The revised modeling framework includes an improved calibration scheme that more accurately reconstructs soil profiles and incorporates parameter uncertainty through Monte Carlo simulations. Using WARMER-2, we evaluated elevation change in three tidal wetlands in the San Francisco Bay Estuary, CA, USA along an estuarine tidal and salinity gradient with varying scenarios of SLR, salinization, and changes in sediment availability. We also tested the sensitivity of marsh elevation and carbon accumulation rates to different plant productivity functions. Wetland elevation at all three sites was sensitive to changes in sediment availability, but sites with greater initial elevations or space for upland transgression persisted longer under higher SLR rates than sites at lower elevations. Using a multi-species wetland vegetation transition model for organic matter contribution to accretion, WARMER-2 projected increased elevations relative to sea levels (resilience) and higher rates of carbon accumulation when compared with projections assuming no future change in vegetation with SLR. A threshold analysis revealed that all three wetland sites were likely to eventually transition to an unvegetated state with SLR rates above 7 mm/yr. Our results show the utility in incorporating additional estuary-specific parameters to bolster confidence in model projections. The new WARMER-2 modeling framework is widely applicable to other tidal wetland ecosystems and can assist in teasing apart important drivers of wetland elevation change under SLR."
https://openalex.org/W3206158647,"Somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) can reprogram differentiated somatic cells to produce individual animals, thus having advantages in animal breeding and chromatin reprogramming. Interspecies SCNT (iSCNT) provides extreme cases of reprogramming failure that can be used to understand the basic biological mechanism of genome reprogramming. It is important to understand the possible mechanisms for the failure of zygotic genome activation (ZGA) in iSCNT embryos in order to improve the efficiency of SCNT embryos. In the present study, we compared the development of bovine-bovine (B-B), ovine-ovine (O-O) SCNT, and ovine-bovine (O-B) iSCNT embryos and found that a developmental block existed in the 8-cell stage in O-B iSCNT embryos. RNA sequencing and q-PCR analysis revealed that the large ribosomal subunit genes (RPL) or the small ribosomal subunit genes (RPS) were expressed at lower levels in the O-B iSCNT embryos. The nucleolin (C23) gene that regulates the ribosomal subunit generation was transcribed at a lower level during embryonic development in O-B iSCNT embryos. In addition, the nucleolin exhibited a clear circular-ring structure in B-B 8-cell stage embryos, whereas this was shell-like or dot-like in the O-B embryos. Furthermore, overexpression of C23 could increase the blastocyst rate of both SCNT and iSCNT embryos and partly rectify the ring-like nucleolin structure and the expression of ribosomal subunit related genes were upregulation, while knockdown of C23 increased the shell-like nucleolin-structure in B-B cloned embryos and downregulated the expression of ribosomal subunit related genes. These results implied that abnormal C23 and ribosome subunit gene expression would lead to the developmental block of iSCNT embryos and ZGA failure. Overexpression of the C23 gene could partly improve the blastocyst development and facilitate the nucleolin structure in bovine preimplantation SCNT embryos."
https://openalex.org/W3206700432,"Individuals are dependent on institutions (e.g., universities, governments, healthcare systems) to protect their safety and advocate for their needs. When institutions harm the individuals who depend on them, they commit institutional betrayal , which has been associated with numerous negative outcomes in prior research. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, students have entrusted universities to protect both their health and their educational opportunities. However, many universities have failed to meet these expectations, and it is likely that many students experience COVID-19-related institutional betrayal. In two similar studies, we examined the prevalence and correlates of institutional betrayal among undergraduate students at a large, public university in the Northwest United States during the fall 2020 and winter 2021quarters. In both studies, more than half of students endorsed at least one type of COVID-19-related institutional betrayal, and higher institutional betrayal ratings were significantly correlated with both current trauma symptoms and COVID-19-related avoidance and intrusion cognitions. In Study 2, the relationship between COVID-19-related institutional betrayal and current trauma symptoms remained significant, even when controlling for gender, personal and familial COVID-19 infection, and past trauma history. These results indicate that COVID-19 institutional betrayal is common and may be uniquely associated with distress among undergraduate students. We suggest it would behoove university institutions to reduce COVID-19-related institutional betrayal."

This cross-sectional analysis describes the adverse event (AE) profile of a large-scale, routine VMMC program and identifies factors associated with the development, severity, and timing of AEs to provide recommendations for program quality improvement.From 2015-2018 there were 28,990 circumcisions performed in International Training and Education Center for Health (I-TECH) supported regions of Namibia in collaboration with the Ministry of Health and Social Services. Two routine follow-up visits after VMMC were scheduled to identify clients with AEs. Summary statistics were used to describe characteristics of all VMMC clients and the subset who experienced an AE. We used chi-square tests to evaluate associations between AE timing, patient age, and other patient and AE characteristics. We used a logistic regression model to explore associations between patient characteristics and AE severity.Of the 498 clients with AEs (AE rate of 1.7%), 40 (8%) occurred ≤2 days, 262 (53%) occurred 3-7 days, 161 (32%) between day 8 and 14, and 35 (7%) were ≥15 days post-VMMC. Early AEs (on or before day 2) tended to be severe and categorized as bleeding, while infections were the most common AEs occurring later (p<0.001). Younger clients (aged 10-14 years) experienced more infections, whereas older clients experienced more bleeding (p<0.001).Almost 40% of AEs occurred after the second follow-up visit, of which 179 (91%) were infections. Improvements in pre-surgical and post-surgical counselling and post-operative educational materials encouraging clients to seek care at any time, adoption of alternative follow-up methods, and the addition of a third follow-up visit may improve outcomes for patients. Enhancing post-surgical counselling and emphasizing wound care for younger VMMC clients and their caregivers could help mitigate elevated risk of infection."
https://openalex.org/W3206961252,"Understating how antibiotic tolerance impacts subsequent resistance development in the clinical setting is important to identifying effective therapeutic interventions and prevention measures. This study describes a patient case of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bacteremia which rapidly developed resistance to three primary MRSA therapies and identifies genetic and metabolic changes selected in vivo that are associated with rapid resistance evolution. Index blood cultures displayed susceptibility to all (non-beta-lactam) antibiotics with the exception of trimethoprim/ sulfamethoxazole. One month after initial presentation, during the same encounter, blood cultures were again positive for MRSA, now displaying intermediate resistance to vancomycin and ceftaroline and resistance to daptomycin. Two weeks later, blood cultures were positive for a third time, still intermediate resistant to vancomycin and ceftaroline and resistant to daptomycin. Mutations in mprF and vraT were common to all multidrug resistant isolates whereas mutations in tagH, agrB and saeR and secondary mprF mutation emerged sequentially and transiently resulting in distinct in vitro phenotypes. The baseline mutation rate of the patient isolates was unremarkable ruling out the hypermutator phenotype as a contributor to the rapid emergence of resistance. However, the index isolate demonstrated pronounced tolerance to the antibiotic daptomycin, a phenotype that facilitates the subsequent development of resistance during antibiotic exposure. This study exemplifies the capacity of antibiotic-tolerant pathogens to rapidly develop both stable and transient genetic and phenotypic changes, over the course of a single patient encounter."
https://openalex.org/W3205446808,"Asymptomatic parasite carriers represent a ""silent"" infective reservoir for malaria transmission and contributes to malaria persistence. However, limited data are available on asymptomatic malaria in Vietnam. Between November 2018 and March 2019, we conducted a malaria epidemiological survey of asymptomatic people (children ≥ 10 years old and adults ≥18 years old, n = 2,809) residing in three communes in Tuy Duc district, Dak Nong province in the Central Highlands of Vietnam. Based on the national stratification of malaria risk, Dak Buk So, Dak Ngo and Quang Truc communes were classified by the National Malaria Control Programme as low, moderate and high malaria endemic areas, respectively. Using participants' finger prick blood samples, malaria parasites were detected by one-step reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). The median age (Interquartile Range) for adults and children were 35 years (26-50) and 12 years (11-14), respectively. The prevalence of asymptomatic malaria was 1.7% (22/1,328), 3.5% (31/890) and 12.2% (72/591) for participants from Dak Buk So, Dak Ngo and Quang Truc, respectively. The prevalence of asymptomatic malaria was lower in children compared to adults: 2.6% (9/352) versus 4.7% (116/2,457) (Odds Ratio 0.53, 95% Confidence Interval 0.28 to1.02). Ownership of long-lasting insecticide-treated bed nets and hammocks was 97.1%, 99.0% and 94.7% for participants in Dak Buk So, Dak Ngo and Quang Truc, respectively, however, only 66.0%, 57.3% and 42.8% of the participants reported using bed nets every night. Of the several risk factors examined, going to the forest two weeks prior to enrolment into the study and sleeping in the forest had a significant association with participants being infected with asymptomatic malaria in Quang Truc, but not in the other two communes. Knowledge of the prevalence and distribution of asymptomatic malaria will help design and evaluate future intervention strategies for malaria elimination in Vietnam."
https://openalex.org/W3207511107,"Fish ecosystems perform ecological functions that are critically important for the sustainability of marine ecosystems, such as global food security and carbon stock. During the 21st century, significant global warming caused by climate change has created pressing challenges for fish ecosystems that threaten species existence and global ecosystem health. Here, we study a coastal fish community in Maizuru Bay, Japan, and investigate the relationships between fluctuations of ST, abundance-based species interactions and salient fish biodiversity. Observations show that a local 20% increase in temperature from 2002 to 2014 underpins a long-term reduction in fish diversity (∼25%) played out by some native and invasive species (e.g. Chinese wrasse) becoming exceedingly abundant; this causes a large decay in commercially valuable species (e.g. Japanese anchovy) coupled to an increase in ecological productivity. The fish community is analyzed considering five temperature ranges to understand its atemporal seasonal sensitivity to ST changes, and long-term trends. An optimal information flow model is used to reconstruct species interaction networks that emerge as topologically different for distinct temperature ranges and species dynamics. Networks for low temperatures are more scale-free compared to ones for intermediate (15-20°C) temperatures in which the fish ecosystem experiences a first-order phase transition in interactions from locally stable to metastable and globally unstable for high temperatures states as suggested by abundance-spectrum transitions. The dynamic dominant eigenvalue of species interactions shows increasing instability for competitive species (spiking in summer due to intermediate-season critical transitions) leading to enhanced community variability and critical slowing down despite higher time-point resilience. Native competitive species whose abundance is distributed more exponentially have the highest total directed interactions and are keystone species (e.g. Wrasse and Horse mackerel ) for the most salient links with cooperative decaying species. Competitive species, with higher eco-climatic memory and synchronization, are the most affected by temperature and play an important role in maintaining fish ecosystem stability via multitrophic cascades (via cooperative-competitive species imbalance), and as bioindicators of change. More climate-fitted species follow temperature increase causing larger divergence divergence between competitive and cooperative species. Decreasing dominant eigenvalues and lower relative network optimality for warmer oceans indicate fishery more attracted toward persistent oscillatory states, yet unpredictable, with lower cooperation, diversity and fish stock despite the increase in community abundance due to non-commercial and venomous species. We emphasize how changes in species interaction organization, primarily affected by temperature fluctuations, are the backbone of biodiversity dynamics and yet for functional diversity in contrast to taxonomic richness. Abundance and richness manifest gradual shifts while interactions show sudden shift. The work provides data-driven tools for analyzing and monitoring fish ecosystems under the pressure of global warming or other stressors. Abundance and interaction patterns derived by network-based analyses proved useful to assess ecosystem susceptibility and effective change, and formulate predictive dynamic information for science-based fishery policy aimed to maintain marine ecosystems stable and sustainable."
https://openalex.org/W3207876046,"Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a major risk factor to cardiovascular diseases. In this study, we investigate the prevalence and associated risky behaviour of MetS in resource-poor urban communities in Accra, Ghana. We analysed data on 111 persons with hypertension, screened and recruited for a therapeutic lifestyle intervention program in August 2015. MetS was measured using the International Diabetes Federation (IDF) and the World Health Organization definitions. The prevalence of MetS was 58.4% and 16.8% by the IDF and WHO definitions respectively. More women (61.8%) compared to men (31.8%) had MetS (p = 0.011). Approximately 31% of the hypertensive patients were engaged in moderate-intensity physical activity; 9.0% were current smokers, 42.0% consumed excess alcohol over the past month prior to the interview and 41.0% discontinued taking their antihypertensive medications without consulting with a doctor. About 42.0% and 37.0% of respondents always consumed fruits and vegetables respectively at least two times a day. The binary logistic regression showed that compared to women, men had lower odds of consuming two or more servings of vegetable in a day (OR: 0.2; 95% CI; 0.1, 0.8). Increase in age was associated with higher odds of consuming fruits at least twice a day (1.0; 1.0, 1.1) but with lower odds of engaging in moderate intensity physical activity (0.9; 0.8, 1.0). Being married was associated with higher odds of engaging in moderate physical activity (2.8; 1.0, 8.2). Therapeutic methods essential for the management of patients with hypertension and MetS should include non-pharmacological remedies targeting the promotion of medication adherence, Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) and physical activities; these are vital to changing unhealthy lifestyle which worsens the underlying pathology."
https://openalex.org/W3207901069,"Although conflict, war, violence, and terrorism affect tourism, research that identifies possible channels of these effects is scarce. We explore if the adverse effects are channelled through proximity to conflict areas. We use the conflict in Kosovo in 1999 and the country Croatia as a quasi-natural experiment and take advantage of the specific north-west to south-east orientation of Croatian Adriatic counties to identify the effect of NATO bombing in Kosovo on tourism outcomes as well as the potential proximity channel. Using data on the population of Croatian firms and the difference-in-differences identification strategy we find that tourism companies' revenues decreased significantly due to NATO bombing, especially in accommodation services and in companies with 50 or more employees. However, using a synthetic control approach we find that the adverse effect is only transitory. Analysing heterogeneous effects with respect to the distance of the firm from Kosovo-using a linear and a more flexible model-we find compelling evidence that within-country proximity to conflict is not a significant channel through which the negative effect propagates."
https://openalex.org/W3205692827,"Secretory IgA (SIgA) is released into mucosal surfaces where its function extends beyond that of host defense to include the shaping of resident microbial communities by mediating exclusion/inclusion of respective microbes and regulating bacterial gene expression. In this capacity, SIgA acts as the fulcrum on which host immunity and the health of the microbiota are balanced. We recently completed an analysis of the gut and salivary IgA-Biomes (16S rDNA sequencing of SIgA-coated/uncoated bacteria) in Mexican-American adults that identified IgA-Biome differences across the glycemic spectrum. As Th17:Treg ratio imbalances are associated with gut microbiome dysbiosis and chronic inflammatory conditions such as type 2 diabetes, the present study extends our prior work by examining the impact of Th17:Treg ratios (pro-inflammatory:anti-inflammatory T-cell ratios) and the SIgA response (Th17:Treg-SIgA axis) in shaping microbial communities. Examining the impact of Th17:Treg ratios (determined by epigenetic qPCR lymphocyte subset quantification) on the IgA-Biome across diabetes phenotypes identified a proportional relationship between Th17:Treg ratios and alpha diversity in the stool IgA-Biome of those with dysglycemia, significant changes in community composition of the stool and salivary microbiomes across glycemic profiles, and genera preferentially abundant by T-cell inflammatory phenotype. This is the first study to associate epigenetically quantified Th17:Treg ratios with both the larger and SIgA-fractionated microbiome, assess these associations in the context of a chronic inflammatory disease, and offers a novel frame through which to evaluate mucosal microbiomes in the context of host responses and inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W3206168482,"Previous studies have reported qualitative characteristics of myelopathy hand, but few studies have reported quantitative kinematic parameters of this condition. Our purpose of this study was to quantitatively evaluate the abnormal finger movements in patients with cervical compressive myelopathy (CCM) (termed myelopathy hand) and to understand the characteristics of myelopathy hand during the grip and release test (GRT) using gyro sensors. Sixty patients with CCM (severe: n = 30; mild-to-moderate: n = 30) and sixty healthy adults (age-matched control: n = 30; young control: n = 30) were included in this study. All participants performed the GRT. The index and little fingers’ and the wrist’s movements during the GRT were recorded using three gyro sensors. The number of cycles, switching time-delay, time per cycle, and peak angular velocity were calculated and compared between groups. Patients with severe CCM had the lowest number of cycles and longest switching time-delays, followed by patients with mild-to-moderate CCM, the age-matched control group, and the young control group. The time per cycle and the peak angular velocities of fingers in participants with severe CCM were significantly lower than those in participants with mild-to-moderate CCM; however, there were no significant differences between the control groups. The peak angular velocities of fingers were significantly lower during extension motions than during flexion motions in participants with CCM. Participants with CCM have lower peak angular velocities during finger movement. Finger extension also is impaired in participants with CCM. Abnormal finger movements and the severity of myelopathy in participants with CCM can be assessed using gyro sensors."
https://openalex.org/W3207149835,"Despite the major threat of leptospirosis to public health in the Philippines, its epidemiologic data remain scarce. Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) is a method often used for identification of circulating Leptospira species and disease surveillance. Unfortunately, molecular typing of Leptospira isolates is not routinely done in most hospital settings. A simplified MLST scheme targeting three loci (adk, lipL41, mreA) was performed for rapid direct typing of Leptospira in clinical specimens. Blood samples from suspected or clinically diagnosed cases (n = 50) were initially screened via polymerase chain reaction (PCR) targeting 23S rRNA, 16S rRNA (rrs2), and lipL32 genes. From the nine positives, seven had interpretable data from MLST. Allelic profiles identified L. interrogans in all positive samples. Six were assigned to ST12 of serovar Manilae (serogroup Pyrogenes) while one sample cannot be clearly differentiated between two serovars/serogroups, Bataviae/Losbanos (serogroup Bataviae) or Australis (serogroup Australis), indicating possibility of a new ST. Phylogenetic analysis confirmed that the application of simplified MLST scheme produces consistent results with the seven-loci genetic profile of published Leptospira MLST schemes. Reduced scheme addressed the challenges often encountered in the amplification of full MLST genetic profile of Leptospira. The approach is a potential alternative to serological tests for rapid typing of clinical specimens and can also aid in investigations on disease epidemiology specifically to monitor occurrence, pathogen transmission, host specificity and susceptibility, and other factors that could lead to potential outbreaks."
https://openalex.org/W3207611526,"Coronary heart disease (CHD) is a prevalent complication of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The atherogenic low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol is an established risk factor of cardiovascular disease, and evidence also suggests that postprandial plasma glucose (PPG) levels closely delineate CHD mortality in diabetes. The investigators hypothesized that postprandial plasma glucose excursion (PPGE), defined as the difference between 2-hour PPG and fasting plasma glucose (FPG), may be associated with plasma LDL cholesterol levels in patients with T2DM. This study enrolled diabetic participants for whom FPG and lipid profile were sampled after a 12-hour fast, followed by PPG sampling two hours after consuming a standard meal with 75 grams of carbohydrates. The study enrolled 379 participants who were divided into PPGE tertiles according to the difference between their 2-hour PPG and FPG. Participants in the highest PPGE tertile had considerably greater plasma LDL cholesterol levels than patients in the lowest tertile (126.7 mg/dL vs. 99.5 mg/dL, P <0.001). Linear regression analysis also demonstrated that the PPGE was positively correlated with plasma LDL cholesterol levels (β coefficient: 0.165, P < 0.001). Postprandial glucose excursion positively correlated with plasma LDL cholesterol levels in individuals with T2DM. Participants with raised PPGE harbored greater LDL cholesterol levels than those with lower postprandial glucose fluctuations. Therefore, postprandial glucose excursion is associated with an atherogenic lipid profile and may be a modifiable risk factor of diabetic CHD."
https://openalex.org/W3207674804,"Species distribution modelling (SDM) gained importance on biodiversity distribution and conservation studies worldwide, including prioritizing areas for public policies and international treaties. Useful for large-scale approaches and species distribution estimates, it is a plus considering that a minor fraction of the planet is adequately sampled. However, minimizing errors is challenging, but essential, considering the uses and consequences of such models. In situ validation of the SDM outputs should be a key-step-in some cases, urgent. Bioacoustics can be used to validate and refine those outputs, especially if the focal species' vocalizations are conspicuous and species-specific. This is the case of echolocating bats. Here, we used extensive acoustic monitoring (>120 validation points over an area of >758,000 km2, and producing >300,000 sound files) to validate MaxEnt outputs for six neotropical bat species in a poorly-sampled region of Brazil. Based on in situ validation, we evaluated four threshold-dependent theoretical evaluation metrics' ability in predicting models' performance. We also assessed the performance of three widely used thresholds to convert continuous SDMs into presence/absence maps. We demonstrated that MaxEnt produces very different outputs, requiring a careful choice on thresholds and modeling parameters. Although all theoretical evaluation metrics studied were positively correlated with accuracy, we empirically demonstrated that metrics based on specificity-sensitivity and sensitivity-precision are better for testing models, considering that most SDMs are based on unbalanced data. Without independent field validation, we found that using an arbitrary threshold for modelling can be a precarious approach with many possible outcomes, even after getting good evaluation scores. Bioacoustics proved to be important for validating SDMs for the six bat species analyzed, allowing a better refinement of SDMs in large and under-sampled regions, with relatively low sampling effort. Regardless of the species assessing method used, our research highlighted the vital necessity of in situ validation for SDMs."
https://openalex.org/W3206159215,"To grow, survive and reproduce under anthropogenic-induced changes, individuals must respond quickly and favourably to the surrounding environment. A species that feeds on a wide variety of prey types (i.e. generalist diet) may be comprised of generalist individuals, specialist individuals that feed on different prey types, or a combination of the two. If individuals within a population respond differently to an environmental change, population-level responses may not be detectable. By tracking foraging movements of great black-backed gulls ( Larus marinus ), a generalist species, we compared group-level and individual-level responses to an increase in prey biomass (capelin; Mallotus villosus ) during the breeding season in coastal Newfoundland, Canada. As hypothesized, shifts in prey availability resulted in significantly different individual responses in foraging behaviour and space use, which was not detectable when data from individuals were combined. Some individuals maintained similar foraging areas, foraging trip characteristics (e.g., trip length, duration) and habitat use with increased capelin availability, while others shifted foraging areas and habitats resulting in either increased or decreased trip characteristics. We show that individual specialization can be non-contextual in some gulls, whereby these individuals continuously use the same feeding strategy despite significant change in prey availability conditions. Findings also indicate high response diversity among individuals to shifting prey conditions that a population- or group-level study would not have detected, emphasizing the importance of examining individual-level strategies for future diet and foraging studies on generalist species."

Genetic heterogeneity of EKV has already been suggested. We investigated at the clinical and genetic level a consanguineous Tunisian family with 2 sisters presenting an autosomal recessive form of EKV to better characterize this disease. Mutational analysis initially screened the connexin genes and Whole-exome sequencing (WES) was performed to identify the molecular aetiology of the particular EKV phenotype in the proband. Migratory shaped erythematous areas are the initial presenting sign followed by relatively stable hyperkeratotic plaques are the two predominates characteristics in both patients. However, remarkable variability of morphological and dominating features of the disease were observed between patients. In particular, the younger sister (proband) exhibited ichthyosiform-like appearance suggesting Autosomal Recessive Congenital Ichthyosis (ARCI) condition. No causative mutations were detected in the GJB3 and GJB4 genes. WES results revealed a novel missense homozygous mutation in NIPAL4 gene (c.835C&gt;G, p.Pro279Ala) in both patients. This variant is predicted to be likely pathogenic. In addition, in silico analysis of the mutated 3D domain structure predicted that this variant would result in NIPA4 protein destabilization and Mg 2+ transport perturbation, pointing out the potential role of NIPAL4 gene in the development and maintenance of the barrier function of the epidermis. Taken togheter, these results expand the clinical phenotype associated with NIPAL4 mutation and reinforce our hypothesis of NIPAL4 as the main candidate gene for the EKV-like ARCI phenotype."

A population derived from 10, 500 M1 plants and their descendants were phenotyped for a wide range of traits leading to the identification of 124 mutants having variations in key agro-morphological traits, and 106 mutants exhibiting variation for physiological traits. Higher yield is the ultimate goal of crop improvement and we identified 574 mutants having higher yield compared to wild type by having better yield attributing traits. Further, a total of 50 mutants showed better panicle exertion phenotypes as compared to Samba Mahsuri leading to enhancement of yield. Upon rigorous screening for three major biotic stresses, 8 mutants showed enhanced tolerance for yellow stem borer (YSB), and 13 different mutants each showed enhanced tolerance for sheath blight (ShB) and bacterial leaf blight (BLB), respectively. In addition, screening at multiple locations that have diverse field isolates identified 3, 3, and 5 lines for tolerance to ShB, YSB and BLB, respectively. On the whole, 1231 desired mutant lines identified at M2 were forwarded to an advanced generation (M5). PCR based allele mining indicated that the BLB tolerant mutants have a different allele than the reported alleles for well-known genes affecting bacterial blight resistance. Whole genome re-sequencing revealed substantial variation in comparison to Samba Mahsuri. The lines showing enhanced tolerance to important biotic stresses (YSB, ShB and BLB) as well as several economically important traits are unique genetic resources which can be utilized for the identification of novel genes/alleles for different traits. The lines which have better agronomic features can be used as pre-breeding lines. The entire mutant population is maintained as a national resource for genetic improvement of the rice crop."

The diagnostic value of WBC count for AL was evaluated and compared with those of neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio, platelet-lymphocyte ratio, lymphocyte-monocyte ratio and platelet count × C-reactive protein level multiplier (P-CRP) value; optimal cut-off values were derived from receiver operating characteristic curves. AL was observed in 11 of the 208 patients (5.3%). Compared with the no-AL group, the AL group had a significantly higher mean WBC count and smoking rate. In multivariate analysis, WBC count and smoking were independent risk factors for AL. Compared with the other tested inflammatory indicators, the cut-off value for WBC (6,200/μL) had the highest sensitivity (81.8%) and negative predictive value (98.4%), as well as the lowest likelihood ratio (0.289). Preoperative WBC count could therefore be a convenient predictor of AL in patients with left-sided CRC."

We enrolled patients who underwent coronary angiography (contrast agent: iohexol). The CI-AKI group included 4 cases, and the non-CI-AKI group included 20 cases. We mixed the 4 CI-AKI samples and 20 non-CI-AKI samples. Then, a 0.6 ml urine sample was used for proteome analysis with LC-MS/MS approach. Metascape, ExPASy, and the Human Protein Atlas were utilized for bioinformatics analysis. We obtained 724 and 830 urine proteins from the CI-AKI and non-CI-AKI groups, respectively. The distribution of the pI values and molecular weights (MWs) of postoperative urine proteins showed no significant difference between the CI-AKI group and the non-CI-AKI group. A total of 99differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were detected, among which 18 proteins were detected only in tubule cells, and 19 proteins were detected in both tubule cells and glomeruli. With GO analysis, the GEPs were mainly associated with immune response and inflammation.

Reverse-transcription quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) is a primary molecular technology that is used to quantify gene expression. Choosing a stable reference gene is significantly important for precisely clarifying the expression level of the target gene. Actin and 18S have been recommended as stable compounds for real-time RT-qPCR in M. persicae under the tested biotic and abiotic conditions. In this study, we checked the stability of Actin and 18S by analyzing the relative expression levels of the cytochrome 450 monooxygenase family member genes CYP6CY3 and CYP6-1, carboxylesterase gene E4 and vacuolar protein sorting gene VPS11 via RT-qPCR under various conditions. The expression levels of these four target genes were normalized using both Actin and 18S individually and the combination of these two genes. Our results confirmed that Actin and 18S can be used as reference genes to normalize the expression of target genes under insecticide treatment and starvation in M. persicae. However, at the developmental stages of M. persicae, the expression of the four tested target genes was normalized stably by Actin but not 18S, with the latter presenting a problematic change with the developmental stages. Thus, the stability of reference genes in response to diverse biotic and abiotic factors should be evaluated before each RT-qPCR experiment."

A study was conducted to identify perceptions of farmers about FMD and ND disease risks and perceptions about vaccination practices by using the modified health belief model. The majority of livestock farmers (>70%) reported that they were aware of the risk and impact of FMD and ND and were willing to vaccinate their livestock (>60%). Focusing on three main livestock farmer groups, about 17.0% of cattle, 15.4% of village chicken, but only 2.3% of small ruminant owners, indicated that the non-availability of vaccinations in the villages was the major constraint to vaccinations (p<0.001), while in contrast twice as many small ruminant farmers compared to cattle and village chicken farmers indicated they had no knowledge about vaccinations and no funds to conduct vaccinations. Limited accessibility to vaccines and vaccinators was related to size of villages (p = 0.001 for cattle; p = 0.027 for small ruminants; p = 0.005 for village chicken). Willingness to vaccinate small ruminants against FMD was associated with the perceived impact of the disease on sales and accessibility of information about vaccination. Accessibility to information about ND vaccination influenced the willingness of village chicken farmers to conduct vaccinations. In addition, beliefs in the effectiveness of vaccinations played a major role in the willingness to carry out vaccinations on both, cattle (β = 0.3, p = 0.018) and village chicken farms (β = 0.5, p<0.001). Our study highlights that policies that increase the accessibility of vaccines and the dissemination of information about disease prevention and vaccination practices in villages of all sizes, have the potential to increase FMD and ND vaccination rates and thereby reduce outbreak occurrence in Myanmar. On the other hand, indirect factors, such as village size strongly influenced the availability of vaccinations."

The model is intended for clinical, operational, financial and supply chain leaders and executives of a comprehensive healthcare system responsible for making decisions that depend on epidemiological contingencies. This paper describes the model that was implemented at NorthShore University HealthSystem and is applicable to any communicable disease whose risk of reinfection for the duration of the pandemic is negligible."
https://openalex.org/W3206282975,"Examining the spread of macroeconomic phenomena between countries has become increasingly popular after the 2008 economic crisis, but the recent COVID-19 pandemic rendered this issue much more relevant as it shed more light on the risks arising from strongly interconnected economies. This paper intends to extend previous studies in this line by examining the relationship between trade openness and business cycle synchronization. It extends the scope of previous analyses in three areas. First, we use a Granger-causality approach to identify synchronization. Second, trade is broken down to the sector level and third, we distinguish between upstream and downstream connections. These developments allow for a directed approach in the analysis. We use conditional logit regressions to estimate the effect of trade openness on the probability of shock-transmission. The results presented in this study contribute to the literature in two ways. First, in addition to revealing a positive effect of aggregate two-way trade on shock-contagion, it also points out that this overall effect hides diverse behavior in specific trading sectors as well as upstream and downstream channels. Second, while some sectors are not significant channels of shock-transmission in either directions, upstream channels seem to be important in agriculture while downstream channels dominate machinery and other manufactures. Also, there are sectors (chemicals and related products) trade in which affects shock-transmission negatively."

We assessed capacity of LLPHFs to manage malaria, pneumonia, diarrhea, and, possible severe bacterial infections (PSBIs) in under-five-year-olds.We conducted a cross-sectional survey in 110 LLPHFs and 129 health workers in Mbarara District, Uganda between May and December 2019. Structured questionnaires and observation forms were used to collect data on availability of treatment guidelines, vital medicines, diagnostics, and equipment; health worker qualifications; and knowledge of management of common childhood infections.Amoxicillin was available in 97%, parental ampicillin and gentamicin in 77%, zinc tablets and oral rehydration salts in >90% while artemether-lumefantrine was available in 96% of LLPHF. About 66% of facilities stocked loperamide, a drug contraindicated in the management of diarrhoea in children. Malaria rapid diagnostic tests and microscopes were available in 86% of the facilities, timers/clocks in 57% but only 19% of the facilities had weighing scales and 6% stocked oxygen. Only 4% of the LLPHF had integrated management of childhood illness (IMCI) booklets and algorithm charts for management of common childhood illnesses. Of the 129 health workers, 52% were certificate nurses/midwives and (26% diploma nurses/clinical officers; 57% scored averagely for knowledge on management of common childhood illnesses. More than a quarter (38%) of nursing assistants had low knowledge scores. No notable significant differences existed between rural and urban LLPHFs in most parameters assessed.Vital first-line medicines for treatment of common childhood illnesses were available in most of the LLPHFs but majority lacked clinical guidelines and very few had oxygen. Majority of health workers had low to average knowledge on management of the common childhood illnesses. There is need for innovative knowledge raising interventions in LLPHFs including refresher trainings, peer support supervision and provision of job aides."

This study investigated the impact of diet and oral anti-diabetic medication on cardio-metabolic health in human-sized diabetic pigs.After a growing pre-phase from ~30 to ~69 kg during which domestic pigs were fed either a low fat, low sucrose diet (group A) or a fast food-type diet elevated in lard (15%) and sucrose (40%) (group B), the pigs were subdivided in 5 groups (n = 7-8 pigs per group). Group 1, normal pigs from group A on a low fat, low sugar (L) pig diet and group 2, normal pigs from group B on a high lard (25%), sucrose-fructose (40%), cholesterol (1%) fast food-type (F) diet. Diabetes (D) was induced in group B pigs by streptozotocin and group 3 received the F diet (DF), group 4 received the F diet with Anti-diabetic medication metformin (2 g.day-1)-pioglitazone (40 mg.day-1) (DFA) and group 5 switched to a Plant-Fish oil (25%), Slowly digestible starch (40%) diet (DPFS). The F and PFS diets were identical for fat, carbohydrate and protein content but only differed in fat and carbohydrate composition. The 5 pig groups were followed up for 7 weeks until reaching ~120 kg.In normal pigs, the F diet predisposed to several abnormalities related to metabolic syndrome. Diabetes amplified the inflammatory and cardiometabolic abnormalities of the F diet, but both oral FA medication and the PFS diet partially corrected these abnormalities (mean±SEM) as follows: Fasting plasma TNF-ɑ (pg.ml-1) and NEFA (mmol.l-1) concentrations were high (p<0.02) in DF (193±55 and 0.79±0.16), intermediate in DFA (136±40 and 0.57±012) and low in DPFS pigs (107±31 and 0.48±0.19). Meal intolerance (response over fasting) for glucose and triglycerides (area under the curve, mmol.h-1) and for lactate (3-h postprandial, mmol.l-1) was high (p<0.03) in DF (489±131, 8.6±4.8 and 2.2±0.6), intermediate in DFA (276±145, 1.4±1.1 and 1.6±0.4) and low in DPFS (184±62, 0.7±1.8 and 0.1±0.1). Insulin-mediated glucose disposal (mg.kg-1.min-1) showed a numerical trend (p = NS): low in DF (6.9±2.2), intermediate in DFA (8.2±1.3) and high in DPFS pigs (10.4±2.7). Liver weight (g.kg-1 body weight) and liver triglyceride concentration (g.kg-1 liver) were high (p<0.001) in DF (23.8±2.0 and 69±14), intermediate in DFA (21.1±2.0 and 49±15) and low in DPFS pigs (16.4±0.7 and 13±2.0). Aorta fatty streaks were high (p<0.01) in DF (16.4±5.7%), intermediate in DFA (7.4±4.5%) and low in DPFS pigs (0.05±0.02%).This translational study using pigs with induced type 2 diabetes provides evidence that a change in nutritional life style from fast food to a plant-fish oil, slowly digestible starch diet can be more effective than sole anti-diabetic medication."
https://openalex.org/W3205344794,"Vitamin D3 (VD3) induces intestinal CYP3A that metabolizes orally administered anti-leukemic chemotherapeutic substrates dexamethasone (DEX) and dasatinib potentially causing a vitamin-drug interaction. To determine the impact of VD3 status on systemic exposure and efficacy of these chemotherapeutic agents, we used VD3 sufficient and deficient mice and performed pharmacokinetic and anti-leukemic efficacy studies. Female C57BL/6J and hCYP3A4 transgenic VD3 deficient mice had significantly lower duodenal (but not hepatic) mouse Cyp3a11 and hCYP3A4 expression compared to VD3 sufficient mice, while duodenal expression of Mdr1a, Bcrp and Mrp4 were significantly higher in deficient mice. When the effect of VD3 status on DEX systemic exposure was compared following a discontinuous oral DEX regimen, similar to that used to treat pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients, male VD3 deficient mice had significantly higher mean plasma DEX levels (31.7 nM) compared to sufficient mice (12.43 nM) at days 3.5 but not at any later timepoints. Following a single oral gavage of DEX, there was a statistically, but not practically, significant decrease in DEX systemic exposure in VD3 deficient vs. sufficient mice. While VD3 status had no effect on oral dasatinib's area under the plasma drug concentration-time curve, VD3 deficient male mice had significantly higher dasatinib plasma levels at t = 0.25 hr. Dexamethasone was unable to reverse the poorer survival of VD3 sufficient vs. deficient mice to BCR-ABL leukemia. In conclusion, although VD3 levels significantly altered intestinal mouse Cyp3a in female mice, DEX plasma exposure was only transiently different for orally administered DEX and dasatinib in male mice. Likewise, the small effect size of VD3 deficiency on single oral dose DEX clearance suggests that the clinical significance of VD3 levels on DEX systemic exposure are likely to be limited."
https://openalex.org/W3205358209,"Evidence on the link between starch intake and caries incidence is conflicting, therefore the cariogenicity of starch compared with sucrose was explored using a dual Constant Depth Film Fermenter (dCDFF) biotic model system. Bovine enamel discs were used as a substrate and the dCDFF was inoculated using human saliva. CDFF units were supplemented with artificial saliva growth media at a constant rate to mimic resting salivary flow rate over 14 days. The CDFF units were exposed to different conditions, 2% sucrose or 2% starch 8 times daily and either no additional fluoride or 1450 ppm F- twice daily. Bovine enamel discs were removed at intervals (days 3, 7, 10 and 14) for bacterial enumeration and enamel analysis using Quantitative Light Induced Fluorescence (QLF) and Transverse Microradiography (TMR). Results showed that in the absence of fluoride there was generally no difference in mineral loss between enamel exposed to either sucrose or starch when analysed using TMR and QLF (P > 0.05). In the presence of fluoride by day 14 there was significantly more mineral loss under starch than sucrose when analysed with TMR (P < 0.05). It was confirmed that starch and sucrose are similarly cariogenic within the dCDFF in the absence of fluoride. With the aid of salivary amylase, the bacteria utilise starch to produce an acidic environment similar to that of bacteria exposed to sucrose only. In the presence of fluoride, starch was more cariogenic which may be due to the bacteria producing a more hydrophobic intercellular matrix lowering the penetration of fluoride through the biofilm. This is significant as it indicates that the focus on sugars being the primary cause of caries may need re-evaluating and an increase in focus on carbohydrates is needed as they may be similarly cariogenic as sugars if not more so."
https://openalex.org/W3207528370,"Rigorous healthcare design research is critical to inform design decisions that improve human experience. Current limitations in the field include a lack of consistent and valid measures that provide feedback about the role of the built environment in producing desirable outcomes. Research findings about nurses' efficiency, quality of care, and satisfaction related to inpatient unit designs have been mixed, and there was previously no validated instrument available to quantitatively measure nurses' ability to work efficiently and effectively in their environment. The objective of this study was to develop, refine, and validate a survey instrument to measure affordance of the care environment to nurse practice, based on various aspects of their work in inpatient units. The HDR Clinical Activities Related to the Environment (CARE) Scale Inpatient Version was developed using item design, refinement, and reliability and validity testing. Psychometric methods from classical test theory and item response theory, along with statistical analyses involving correlations and factor analysis, and thematic summaries of qualitative data were conducted. The four-phase process included (1) an initial pilot study, (2) a content validation survey, (3) cognitive interviews, and (4) a final pilot study. Results from the first three phases of analysis were combined to inform survey scale revisions before the second pilot survey, such as a reduction in the number and rewording of response options, and refinement of scale items. The updated 9-item scale showed excellent internal consistency and improved response distribution and discrimination. The factor analysis revealed a unidimensional measure of nurse practice, as well as potential subscales related to integration, efficiency, and patient care. Within the healthcare design industry, this scale is much needed to generate quantitative and standardized data and will facilitate greater understanding about the aspects of an inpatient healthcare facility that best support nurses' ability to provide quality patient care."
