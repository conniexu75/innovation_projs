https://openalex.org/W1997491947,"Brill, a vice president of Agracetus, a biotechnology firm, and adjunct professor of bacteriology, focuses on the safety issues raised by the use of genetically engineered plants and microorganisms in agriculture. He also discusses ways of predicting the risk level of an organism that has received foreign genes. He concludes that organisms created by genetic engineering techniques are unlikely to be greater sources of environmental problems than those produced by more traditional agricultural breeding practices."

https://openalex.org/W1983001584,"An overview is presented of the growing trend toward industrial investment in scientific research at universities throughout the United States. Examples of various types of collaborative arrangements are cited, and the potential ethical and social implications of this collaboration are considered."
https://openalex.org/W1989465554,"As the number of cooperative research programs between universities and industries grows, the potential for problems that stem from the inherent differences between the two types of organizations increases as well. The key to success in such relationships lies in anticipating problems and developing guidelines for averting them or dealing effectively with them. Ten guidelines for successful university ties with industry are discussed. The topics covered include publication rights, patent ownership, copyrights, confidentiality agreements, research units, faculty consultants, faculty entrepreneurs, international agreements, the sharing of personnel and equipment, and model research agreements."

But the work raises numerous questions as well: Can such promise be true? What is the ethical cost of such developments? Who will fund the necessary R&D?

This special issue takes a look at these questions. The Reviews begin with Watt and Hogan's (p. [1427][1]) description of what's currently known about stem cells. As the authors note, some stem cells are pluripotent: essentially blank slates that are ready when called on to differentiate into any cell type. But, as described by Slack (p. [1431][2]), stem cells of certain tissues, such as epithelial structures, must fit in with existing tissue architecture. In a related Report, Meng et al. (p. [1489][3]) describe progress in the search for stem cells that give rise to sperm.

A particular surprise has been the discovery of stem cells in unexpected places. As reviewed by Gage (p. [1433][4]), the adult central nervous system, long thought not to contain cells capable of dividing, in fact harbors stem cells. Such cells may help treat Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. In addition, as discussed by Weissman (p. [1442][5]), hematopoietic stem cells from bone marrow may one day provide transplants to replace blood and immune cells.

The very blankness of stem cells has turned out to be a surprise as well: The right signals can send some adult stem cells down unexpected paths of differentiation. Van der Kooy and Weiss (p. [1439][6]) discuss theories about the origins and development of this remarkable plasticity.

With these developments come great ethical challenges. Certain stem cells that show therapeutic potential are derived from early embryos or from fetal germ cells. As shown in a series of Viewpoints, opinions vary widely about whether the potential benefits outweigh the ethical costs of using such cells. To Young (p. [1424][7]), the answer is clearly yes. But, as Perry notes (p. [1423][8]), the use of such cells involves ethical issues that must be considered with great respect for the sanctity of human life. Reflecting the issue's complexity, policies of various governing bodies also vary. Lenoir (p. [1425][9]) presents a European perspective.

Finally, the News component of this special issue includes three stories. One addresses the issue of whether adult stem cells can provide cells for all kinds of tissues, thereby relieving the ethical quandary posed by the use of embryonic or fetal cells. The second looks at the companies now going into the stem cell business, and the third deals with the lessons that 10 years of fetal cell transplants for treatment of Parkinson's disease might provide for the stem cell work.

Whatever the scientific and ethical uncertainties, as Frankel notes in the Editorial (p. [1397][10]), we must move with all due consideration, but without unnecessary delay, toward the answers so that the promises and benefits of stem cells can be effectively explored.

Problems explored included the protection of academic freedom and values in collaborative research, the sums of money involved, faculty roles, and patents. Representative Albert Gore, previewing his House subcommittee's report, called for a national guideline-writing conference.

The conferees agreed that such collaboration must not promote secrecy that will retard scientific progress, interfere with the choice of faculty and student research projects, divert faculty and university resources from their primary obligations to teaching and research, or impair the university's credibility. They considered alternative approaches to contract disclosure, control of patents, and conflict of interest problems, but left resolution of the issues to individual universities."

In a 1956 trial, a federal judge denied compensation to the sheep owners. Evidence of the deception came to light in 1979 and 1980 and, on 24 August 1982, the same judge ordered a new trial, ruling that several AEC attorneys and scientists had indeed misrepresented the facts. His ruling has been appealed by the Department of Justice."

The paper dismisses population growth in developing countries as a cause of unemployment, illegal migration, or famine, and asserts that population programs are no substitute for ending government controls that stifle economic growth. It also contains a strong statement against abortion, states the U.S. position against coercion in family planning, and declares the Reagan administration's resolve not to fund programs advocating abortion. The U.S. stance is expected to antagonize developing countries and isolate the United States at the U.N. conference."

The authors present a personal account of the research that led to Dolly the cloned sheep.
