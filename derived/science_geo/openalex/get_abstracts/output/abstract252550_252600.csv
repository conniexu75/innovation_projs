https://openalex.org/W2104004065,"A continuum description of granular flows would be of considerable help in predicting natural geophysical hazards or in designing industrial processes. However, the constitutive equations for dry granular flows, which govern how the material moves under shear, are still a matter of debate. One difficulty is that grains can behave like a solid (in a sand pile), a liquid (when poured from a silo) or a gas (when strongly agitated). For the two extreme regimes, constitutive equations have been proposed based on kinetic theory for collisional rapid flows, and soil mechanics for slow plastic flows. However, the intermediate dense regime, where the granular material flows like a liquid, still lacks a unified view and has motivated many studies over the past decade. The main characteristics of granular liquids are: a yield criterion (a critical shear stress below which flow is not possible) and a complex dependence on shear rate when flowing. In this sense, granular matter shares similarities with classical visco-plastic fluids such as Bingham fluids. Here we propose a new constitutive relation for dense granular flows, inspired by this analogy and recent numerical and experimental work. We then test our three-dimensional (3D) model through experiments on granular flows on a pile between rough sidewalls, in which a complex 3D flow pattern develops. We show that, without any fitting parameter, the model gives quantitative predictions for the flow shape and velocity profiles. Our results support the idea that a simple visco-plastic approach can quantitatively capture granular flow properties, and could serve as a basic tool for modelling more complex flows in geophysical or industrial applications."

https://openalex.org/W2124740263,"Aftershocks, the most common type of earthquake, were thought to be triggered by static stresses induced by an earlier ‘mainshock’. Recent work suggested that dynamic stresses, or shaking, may also be a factor, and a study based on analysis of the earthquake locations in the 1984–2002 Southern California catalogue confirms that view. Precise measurements of the decay of aftershock density with distance show that the probability of an aftershock is consistent with a maximum amplitude of seismic shaking at distances of 0.2 to 50 km from a mainshock. The majority of earthquakes are aftershocks1, yet aftershock physics is not well understood. Many studies suggest that static stress changes2,3 trigger aftershocks, but recent work suggests that shaking (dynamic stresses) may also play a role4,5. Here we measure the decay of aftershocks as a function of distance from magnitude 2–6 mainshocks in order to clarify the aftershock triggering process. We find that for short times after the mainshock, when low background seismicity rates allow for good aftershock detection, the decay is well fitted by a single inverse power law over distances of 0.2–50 km. The consistency of the trend indicates that the same triggering mechanism is working over the entire range. As static stress changes at the more distant aftershocks are negligible, this suggests that dynamic stresses may be triggering all of these aftershocks. We infer that the observed aftershock density is consistent with the probability of triggering aftershocks being nearly proportional to seismic wave amplitude. The data are not fitted well by models that combine static stress change with the evolution of frictionally locked faults3."

https://openalex.org/W1976835478,"Many organs are composed of tubular networks that arise by branching morphogenesis in which cells bud from an epithelium and organize into a tube. Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) and other signalling molecules have been shown to guide branch budding and outgrowth, but it is not known how epithelial cells coordinate their movements and morphogenesis. Here we use genetic mosaic analysis in Drosophila melanogaster to show that there are two functionally distinct classes of cells in budding tracheal branches: cells at the tip that respond directly to Branchless FGF and lead branch outgrowth, and trailing cells that receive a secondary signal to follow the lead cells and form a tube. These roles are not pre-specified; rather, there is competition between cells such that those with the highest FGF receptor activity take the lead positions, whereas those with less FGF receptor activity assume subsidiary positions and form the branch stalk. Competition appears to involve Notch-mediated lateral inhibition that prevents extra cells from assuming the lead. There may also be cooperation between budding cells, because in a mosaic epithelium, cells that cannot respond to the chemoattractant, or respond only poorly, allow other cells in the epithelium to move ahead of them."

https://openalex.org/W2070254655,"The hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1α and HIF-2α are closely related, key transcriptional regulators of the hypoxic response, countering a low oxygen situation with the up-regulation of target genes associated with numerous processes, including vascularization and glycolysis. This involves a dual mechanism of control through both stabilization and transactivation, regulated via prolyl and asparaginyl hydroxylation. Despite high similarity with respect to protein sequence and activation pathway, a growing number of physiological and mechanistic differences between HIF-1α and HIF-2α are being reported. To further characterize this nonredundancy, the stabilization of endogenous proteins and regulation of the transactivation domains were compared in a graded oxygen environment across a series of cell lines. Although generally similar results were found, interesting and specific differences between the HIF-α proteins were observed within certain cell lines, such as rat adrenal PC12s, emphasizing the cell-specific nature of HIF-α regulation. We characterize a conserved amino acid substitution between HIF-1α and HIF-2α that contributes to the intrinsically higher FIH-1-mediated asparaginyl hydroxylation of HIF-1α and, hence, lower HIF-1α activity. In addition, our data demonstrate that the different cell lines can be classified into two distinct groups: those in which stabilization and transactivation proceed in conjunction (HeLa, 293T, and COS-1) and those cells in which HIF-α is stabilized prior to transactivation (PC12, HepG2, and CACO2). Interestingly, the initial stabilization of HIF-α prior to transactivation up-regulation predicted from in vitro derived hydroxylation data is only true for a subset of cells.

In a state of hypoxia, where the demand for oxygen exceeds supply, physiological responses are mounted, including increasing the capacity for blood to carry oxygen to tissues and facilitating the production of ATP by anaerobic glycolysis. The hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) 4The abbreviations used are: HIF, hypoxia-inducible factor; hHIF, human HIF; PHD, HIF prolyl hydroxylase; CAD, C-terminal transactivation domain; DBD, DNA binding domain; DP, dipyridyl; CBP, CREB-binding protein; CREB, cAMP-response element-binding protein.4The abbreviations used are: HIF, hypoxia-inducible factor; hHIF, human HIF; PHD, HIF prolyl hydroxylase; CAD, C-terminal transactivation domain; DBD, DNA binding domain; DP, dipyridyl; CBP, CREB-binding protein; CREB, cAMP-response element-binding protein. are key transcriptional regulators of this genomic response to hypoxia in essentially all mammalian cells. HIF is composed of an oxygen-regulated HIF-α subunit (HIF-1α or HIF-2α) and the ubiquitous aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator (or HIF-1β) partner protein. HIF-α protein turnover in normoxia is very rapid due to the inhibitory action of the HIF-α prolyl hydroxylases (PHDs). These oxygen-dependent enzymes hydroxylate two conserved prolyl residues within a central oxygen-dependent degradation domain of the HIF-α proteins, promoting binding of the Von Hippel-Lindau protein, ubiquitylation, and proteasomal degradation (1Maxwell P.H. Wiesener M.S. Chang G.W. Clifford S.C. Vaux E.C. Cockman M.E. Wykoff C.C. Pugh C.W. Maher E.R. Ratcliffe P.J. Nature. 1999; 399: 271-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (4025) Google Scholar, 2Ohh M. Park C.W.

Any HIF-α escaping this normoxic degradation is also subject to hydroxylation of a conserved asparagine within the C-terminal transactivation domain (CAD) that represses activity via abrogation of CBP/p300 recruitment (4Lando D. Peet D.J. Whelan D.A. Gorman J.J. Whitelaw M.L. Science. 2002; 295: 858-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (1248) Google Scholar, 5Sang N. Fang J. Srinivas V. Leshchinsky I. Caro J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 2984-2992Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Under hypoxic conditions, the activity of the prolyl and asparaginyl hydroxylases is inhibited, and the HIF-α proteins are stabilized and transcriptionally activated, leading to potent induction of target genes. Despite high conservation in overall amino acid sequence, domain structure, and hypoxia-dependent mechanisms of activation, HIF-1α and HIF-2α have distinct physiological roles. This is demonstrated by deficient mouse phenotypes and immunohistochemical analyses of whole rodents, where hypoxia induces either HIF-1α or HIF-2α stabilization in distinct cell populations, even within the same tissue (6Stroka D.M.

Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2002; 7: 1721-1732Crossref Scopus (457) Google Scholar). Multiple examples of tissue-specific differences in regulation have also been reported. For example, HIF-1α is induced by more moderate hypoxia in the brain for a longer period of time, compared with the liver or kidney, which require more severe hypoxia to stabilize HIF-1α in a more transient manner (6Stroka D.M. Burkhardt T. Desbaillets I. Wenger R.H. Neil D.A. Bauer C. Gassmann M. Candinas D. FASEB J. 2001; 13: 2445-2453Crossref Scopus (540) Google Scholar). Similarly, HIF-2α is strongly induced by hypoxia in the liver, but only weakly in the brain and kidney, although in each organ HIF-2α protein was maintained over a longer time course than HIF-1α (7Wiesener M.S. Jurgensen J.S. Rosenberger C. Scholze C.K. Horstrup J.H. Warnecke C. Mandriota S. Bechmann I. Frei U.A. Pugh C.W. Ratcliffe P.J. Bachmann S. Maxwell P.H. Eckardt K.U. FASEB J. 2003; 2: 271-273Crossref Scopus (541) Google Scholar). These observations demonstrate physiological specificity between HIF-1α and HIF-2α, as do a growing number of differences noted with respect to nonhypoxic stimuli, target genes, and interaction partners, which may underlie differences in deficient mouse phenotypes and tumorigenicity. This has been recently demonstrated in renal clear cell carcinoma cells, in which HIF-1α and HIF-2α were shown to have differences in target gene specificity and tumorigenic activity (9Raval R.R. Lau K.W. Tran M.G. Sowter H.M. Mandriota S.J. Li J.L. Pugh C.W. Maxwell P.H. Harris A.L. Ratcliffe P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 5675-5686Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar). In accordance, the major focus of this work was to compare and contrast the hypoxia-dependent regulation of HIF-1α and HIF-2α in a defined cellular system, characterizing both protein stabilization and CAD activation. To this end, six different cell types were grown in defined levels of hypoxia, and the stabilization of endogenous HIF-1α and HIF-2α, as well as the transcriptional activity of transfected CAD fusion proteins, were analyzed. Overall, both HIF-α proteins were regulated in a similar manner, although some specific differences were observed in basal or normoxic HIF-1α versus HIF-2α activity and also between different cell lines. One potential factor underlying these HIF-α differences is the presence of a single conserved amino acid substitution within the CAD, immediately C-terminal to the hydroxyasparagine. Swapping the identity of this residue between HIF-1α and HIF-2α revealed a converse effect on hydroxylation by FIH-1 (factor inhibiting HIF) and consequently transactivation; hence, this single residue is likely to contribute to their distinct functions in vivo. In addition, significant differences in oxygen-dependent HIF-α stabilization and transactivation were observed within and between the different cell lines.

In order to directly compare the activities of HIF-1α and HIF-2α and to test the relative thresholds of HIF-α stabilization and transactivation, a varied panel of six cell lines was chosen, with four of human origin (293T, HeLa, HepG2, and CACO-2) in addition to cells derived from monkeys (COS-1) and rats (PC12), to facilitate the analysis of cell-specific HIF-α regulatory effects. Levels of endogenous HIF-1α and HIF-2α protein were analyzed by Western blotting, and transcriptional activity of the CAD was analyzed in the same cells under similar conditions using CADs fused to the heterologous Gal4 DNA-binding domain (Gal-DBD) in a reporter gene assay. Cells were transfected for 6 h and then incubated for 14 h in an atmosphere containing 20% (normoxia), 10%, 5%, 2%, or less than 1% oxygen. In addition, cells at normoxia were also treated for 14 h witha 1 mm concentration of the hypoxia mimetic dipyridyl (DP). Endogenous HIF-1α protein was induced by hypoxia in all cell lines analyzed, with maximal protein induction at <1% O2. Hypoxic induction of endogenous HIF-1α has been previously demonstrated in response to 4–24 h of exposure to hypoxia in many of these cell lines, although only HIF-1α protein induction in HeLa cells has been analyzed in any detail in graded O2 environments (10Jiang B.H. Semenza G.L. Bauer C. Marti H.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C1172-C1180Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In agreement with Jiang et al. (10Jiang B.H. Semenza G.L. Bauer C. Marti H.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C1172-C1180Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), HIF-1α protein in the HeLa cells was barely detectable at ≥5% O2 but was up-regulated at 2% O2 and further induced by <1% O2 or DP (Fig. 1A). Importantly, significant differences in induction of HIF-1α protein were observed between cell types. For example, in 293T cells (Fig. 1B), HIF-1α protein is detectable in 5% O2 and strongly expressed in 2% O2, yet PC12 and CACO-2 cells require much more severe hypoxia (<1% O2) for significant stabilization (Fig. 1, D and E). These differences may reflect different sensitivities of the cell to hypoxia or simply be a consequence of different metabolic rates and hence absolute oxygen levels within different cell types. In the majority of cell lines, stabilization of HIF-2α paralleled that of HIF-1α, with maximal protein induction at <1% O2. The one major exception was in PC12 cells, where a 4-h hypoxic incubation in <1% O2, although sufficient to strongly stabilize HIF-1α, was not sufficient to stabilize detectable levels of HIF-2α (Fig. 1D). However, extending the incubation to 16 h led to a robust induction of HIF-2α protein. This difference in the kinetics of induction of HIF-2α compared with HIF-1α is also observed to a lesser extent in HeLa cells but not any of the other cell types. Also in contrast to the other cell lines, DP only weakly stabilized HIF-2α in PC12 and HeLa cells compared with severe hypoxia (Fig. 1, D and A). The functionality of DP in these cells is demonstrated by strong up-regulation of HIF-1α protein and CAD induction in reporter assays (see below). These data suggest that the mechanism of HIF-2α degradation in PC12 and to a lesser extent HeLa cells is distinct from HIF-1α and the other cell types analyzed. The absence of detectable HIF-2α protein in 293T cells (Fig. 1B) also agrees with a previous report (11Wiesener M.S. Turley H. Allen W.E. Willam C. Eckardt K.U. Talks K.L. Wood S.M. Gatter K.C. Harris A.L. Pugh C.W. Ratcliffe P.J. Maxwell P.H. Blood. 1998; 92: 2260-2268Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, overall, HIF-1α and HIF-2α stabilization occur under similar O2 levels, and differences are cell-specific rather than general in nature. The carotid body protects against hypoxia by measuring arterial oxygen tension and regulating such processes as breathing and heart rate (via catecholamine secretion) accordingly. PC12 cells are derived from a rat pheochromocytoma and are commonly used to investigate oxygen sensing as they share a number of characteristics with those of the type I carotid body. It was therefore of interest that PC12 cells displayed a unique property of differential HIF-α protein induction kinetics (Fig. 1D). To analyze this further, a hypoxic time course was performed that confirmed maximal HIF-1α protein stabilization within 2 h, yet full HIF-2α induction required 8–16 h (Fig. 2A). This confirms an obvious difference in kinetics and not just lower levels of HIF-2α compared with the other cell types. Furthermore, treatment with desferroxamine, another hypoxia-mimicking iron chelator, also only stabilized HIF-1α but not HIF-2α (Fig. 2B). This further demonstrates that in PC12 cells, the pathways by which hypoxiamimicking chemicals and physiological hypoxia regulate the HIF-α proteins differ between HIF-1α and HIF-2α. Analyses of transfected CADs in the same cell types showed no obvious differences in O2-dependent regulation of HIF-1α and HIF-2α; the CADs from both proteins were activated in a similar manner by graded hypoxia within a given cell line. However, the different cell lines are separable into two distinct groups based upon CAD activation: those in which the HIF-α CADs are progressively activated from 10% down to <1% O2 (HeLa, 293T, COS-1) and those in which the CADs only activated in severe hypoxia (<1% O2) (PC12, CACO-2, and HepG2). This difference between cell lines in hypoxia-induced transactivation is not simply attributable to FIH-1 protein levels, since these did not vary widely between cell lines, and the cells with the highest level of FIH-1 expression, 293T and HepG2 cells, represented different classes of CAD activity (Fig. 2C). This cell-specific difference is also largely in contrast to protein stabilization, where most cell lines displayed very similar profiles of HIF-1α and HIF-2α, being stabilized at O2 levels of between 5 and 2% and reaching maximal up-regulation at <1% O2. Similar to the regulation of the CAD, more severe levels of hypoxia were required to stabilize the HIF-α proteins in PC12 and CACO2 cells. In contrast, HepG2 cells strongly stabilized HIF-α at oxygen levels of between 5 and 2% yet clearly still required <1% oxygen for CAD function. Thus, these results demonstrate that in many cells oxygen-dependent stabilization and transactivation are not linked, and the profile of one can vary without the profile of the other changing. It also demonstrates that as oxygen levels decrease, protein stabilization does not necessarily precede transactivation, but is dependent upon cellular context. Interestingly, consistent differences were observed in normoxic or basal CAD activity. For all cell lines, the HIF-2α CAD had higher normoxic activity than HIF-1α, with the exception of HeLa cells. These differences varied from around 2-fold in COS-1 cells, up to at least 10-fold in HepG2 cells (Fig. 1F), and do not appear to reflect a difference in CAD expression levels as determined by α-GalDBD Western blotting (Fig. 1, A, B, and D, lower panels). Due to transfection efficiencies, the GalDBD CADs were only visualized in HeLa, 293T, and PC12 cells. These results agree with the higher normoxic activity of full-length HIF-2α commonly reported (4Lando D. Peet D.J. Whelan D.A. Gorman J.J. Whitelaw M.L.

https://openalex.org/W2044045143,"The edge-on disk surrounding the nearby young star beta Pictoris is the archetype of 'debris disks', which are composed of dust and gas produced by collisions between--and evaporation of--planetesimals, analogues of Solar System comets and asteroids. These disks may provide insight into the formation and early evolution of terrestrial planets. Previous work on beta Pic concluded that the disk gas has roughly solar abundances of elements, but this poses a problem because such gas should rapidly be blown away from the star, contrary to observations showing a stable gas disk in keplerian rotation. Here we report the detection of singly and doubly ionized carbon (C II, C III) and neutral atomic oxygen (O I) gas in the beta Pic disk. Carbon is extremely overabundant relative to every other measured element. This appears to solve the problem of the stable gas disk, because the carbon overabundance should keep the gas disk in keplerian rotation. The overabundance may indicate that the gas is produced from material more carbon-rich than expected of Solar System analogues."

We also demonstrate that Nox1 activation requires membrane recruitment of Noxa1, which is normally mediated via Noxa1 binding to Noxo1, a protein tethered to the Nox1 partner p22phox: the Noxa1-Noxo1 and Noxo1-p22phox interactions are both essential for Nox1 activity.

Activation of gp91phox/Nox2 requires the small GTPase Rac and the two specific adaptor proteins p47phox and p67phox, each containing two SH3 domains. These proteins, albeit existing in the cytoplasm of resting phagocytes, are targeted upon cell stimulation to the membrane to interact with the gp91phox-p22phox complex, which allows gp91phox to transport electrons for superoxide production (10Koshkin V.

Noxo1 is known to bind to p22phox via its tandem SH3 domains, whereas Noxa1 interacts with Noxo1 by binding of the Noxa1 SH3 domain to the Noxo1 C terminus (Refs. 40Matsuno K. Yamada H. Iwata K.

The roles of these interactions in Nox1 activation, however, have remained to be elucidated. Rac is considered to be involved in ROS production also in non-phagocytic cells (1Bokoch G.M. Knaus U.G.

This small GTPase, however, does not seem to be directly involved in activation of non-phagocytic oxidases such as Nox3 (50Ueno N. Takeya R. Miyano K. Kikuchi H. Sumimoto H. J. Biol.

On the other hand, it has been reported that blockade of molecules acting upstream of Rac activation decreases superoxide production in Nox1-expressing cells, suggesting the involvement of Rac (53Park H.S.

However, it has remained unknown how Rac functions in Nox1 activation. We have previously demonstrated that GTP-loaded Rac directly interacts with the N-terminal TPR domain of Noxa1 as well as that of p67phox; the interaction is abolished by substitution of Glu for Arg-103 (Ref. 42Takeya R.

In the present study, we show that electropermeabilized HeLa cells, which ectopically express Nox1, Noxo1, and Noxa1, produce superoxide in a GTP-dependent manner. The production is decreased when a mutant Noxa1(R103E) is expressed instead of the wild-type one, indicative of the role for Rac. Consistent with this, Nox1-dependent superoxide production by intact HeLa cells is decreased by depletion or sequestration of Rac, but enhanced by expression of the constitutively active Rac1(Q61L). We also demonstrate that Nox1 activation requires membrane recruitment of Noxa1, which is normally mediated via Noxa1 binding to Noxo1, a protein tethered to the Nox1 partner p22phox: the Noxa1-Noxo1 and Noxo1-p22phox interactions are both required for the superoxide producing activity of Nox1. Rac functions in Nox1 activation via its interaction with Noxa1: this GTPase likely acts by inducing a conformational change of the activation domain of Noxa1; it also facilitates membrane localization of Noxa1 in the absence of sufficient interaction between Noxa1 and Noxo1. Plasmid Construction—The human cDNAs encoding Nox1, gp91phox/Nox2, p22phox, Noxo1, Noxa1, p47phox, p67phox, Rac1, and the p21-binding domain of the protein kinase Pak (Pak-PBD; amino acids 66-147) were prepared as previously described (27Koga H.

Mutations leading to the indicated amino acid substitutions were introduced by PCR-mediated site-directed mutagenesis. The DNA fragments were ligated to the indicated expression vectors. All the constructs were sequenced for confirmation of their identities. Transfection of cDNAs Encoding Nox1, gp91phox, p22phox, and Cytosolic Regulatory Proteins in HeLa, Caco-2, and CHO Cells—The cDNAs for Nox1 and gp91phox were ligated to the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.0 (Invitrogen).

Transfection of the human colon cancer Caco-2 cells with cDNAs for Noxo1 and Noxa1 was performed with Cell Line Nucleofector® Kit T (Amaxa) using the Nucleofector® apparatus (Amaxa), according to the manufacturer's instruction. Estimation of Oxidase Proteins Expressed in HeLa, Caco-2, and CHO Cells—Total cell lysates of HeLa, Caco-2, and CHO cells were used for estimation of expression of Noxo1, Noxa1, p47phox, and p67phox.

https://openalex.org/W2020288988,"The ""class E"" vacuolar protein sorting (VPS) pathway mediates sorting of ubiquitinated cargo into the forming vesicles of the multivesicular bodies (MVB), and it is essential for down-regulation of signaling by growth factors and budding of enveloped viruses such as Ebola and HIV-1. Work in yeast has identified DOA4 as a gene that is recruited by the class E machinery to remove ubiquitin from the endosomal cargo before it is incorporated into MVB vesicles, but the identity of the mammalian counterpart is unclear. Here we report the interaction of AMSH (associated molecule with the SH3 domain of STAM), an endosomal deubiquitinating enzyme, with the endodomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT-III) subunits CHMP1A, CHMP1B, CHMP2A, and CHMP3. We also show that a catalytically inactive AMSH inhibits retroviral budding in a dominant-negative manner and induces the accumulation of ubiquitinated forms of an endosomal cargo, namely murine leukemia virus Gag. Finally, VPS4 and AMSH compete for binding to the C-terminal regions of CHMP1A and CHMP1B, revealing a coordinated interaction with ESCRT-III. Taken together, these results are consistent with a role of AMSH in the deubiquitination of the endosomal cargo preceding lysosomal degradation."

To date, IRE motifs have been found in a relatively small number of mRNAs.

Cell Culture and Treatments—Cells were grown in 5% CO2 at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% l-glutamine, 1% penicillin, and 1% streptomycin (HeLa, MCF7, HepG2, and 293 cell lines), or in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin, and 1% streptomycin (K562, THP1, and 786-O cell lines). Cells were treated with 100 μm desferrioxamine (DFO, Sigma), 100 μm hemin (Leiras Oy, Finland), or 100 μm ferric ammonium citrate (Sigma) for 10 h. Mice—Animals were housed under a constant light/dark cycle in the EMBL SPF Mouse Barrier Unit. C57BL6/J females at weaning age were fed with a low iron (<10 mg/kg) diet (C1000, Altromin, Lage, Germany) for 3 weeks. Iron deficiency was assessed by decreased hematocrit (0.12 ± 0.03 liters/liter, n = 3, for mice fed with the iron-deficient diet compared with 0.31 ± 0.04 liters/liter, n = 3, for animals fed with the control diet) and hemoglobin values (7.6 ± 0.8 g/dl, n = 3, for mice fed with the iron-deficient diet compared with 12.8 ± 0.6 g/dl, n = 3, for animals fed with the control diet). Mice were sacrificed by CO2 inhalation, and tissues were collected in RNAlater (Ambion) for subsequent RNA extraction. Animal handling was in accordance with institutional guidelines. Plasmid Construction—Wild-type and mutant FTH1 constructions for generating EMSA probes have been described previously (21Gray N.K. Quick S. Goossen B. Constable A. Hirling H. Kuhn L.C. Hentze M.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 218: 657-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). A human CDC14A IRE probe was generated by replacing the FTH1 IRE sequence of the I-12. CAT plasmid (21Gray N.K. Quick S. Goossen B. Constable A. Hirling H. Kuhn L.C. Hentze M.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 218: 657-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) with synthetic oligonucleotides (Table S1) comprising the CDC14A IRE sequence. DNA templates were linearized with XbaI and used for in vitro transcription with T7 RNA polymerase. RNA Extraction, Immunopurification of mRNPs, and Northern Blotting—Total RNA was extracted from cultured cells or mouse tissues using TRIzol (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For immunopurifications, 50 μg of total RNA was denatured at 95 °C for 5 min and incubated with 2 μg of recombinant His-tagged IRP1 protein (21Gray N.K. Quick S. Goossen B. Constable A. Hirling H. Kuhn L.C. Hentze M.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 218: 657-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) for 10 min at 25 °C in immunopurification buffer IPP150 (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40) supplemented with 1% β-mercaptoethanol, 200 units of RNasin (Promega), and 200 units of Protector RNase Inhibitor (Roche Applied Science). Subsequently, 100 μl of 50% Protein A-Sepharose bead slurry (Merck) was added together with an affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal anti-IRP1 antibody raised against recombinant full-length human IRP1 (5Galy B. Ferring D. Hentze M.W. Genesis. 2005; 43: 181-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), and the reactions were incubated for 30 min at 10 °C. Beads were washed twice in IPP150 buffer and treated with proteinase K prior to RNA extraction. RNA from the supernatant and the bead fractions was phenol-chloroform-extracted, ethanol-precipitated, and resuspended in water. Mouse liver and duodenal samples were studied by Northern blot analysis. One-fifth of the immunopurified RNA and one-third of the RNA present in the supernatant fraction were resolved on 1.2% formaldehyde-agarose gels and blotted onto nylon membranes (Nytran N, Schleicher and Schuell, Dassel, Germany). The membranes were then hybridized to 32P-labeled DNA probes in Church Buffer (0.5 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, 7% w/v SDS, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0) (22Church G.M. Gilbert W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 1991-1995Crossref PubMed Scopus (7266) Google Scholar). Radiolabeled DNA probes were generated by random primer labeling (High Prime, Roche Applied Science) of purified PCR products obtained from cDNA clones of the following mouse genes: Tfrc, Slc40a1 or Ireg1, Ftl, Fth1, β-actin, and Gapdh. The signals obtained were quantified using a PhosphorImager (Fujifilm FLA-2000, Amersham Biosciences). Computer-assisted Identification of Putative IREs—Human, mouse, and rodent sections of the EMBL data base (version 77) were screened for the presence of IRE-like motifs combining sequence and RNA fold energy criteria, as described previously (14Bengert P. Dandekar T. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3441-3445Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). For 5′-UTR IRE motifs, the search was restricted to sequences located within the first 200 nucleotides of the mRNA leader; for 3′-UTR IRE motifs, only sequences conserved in at least two species were selected. Additionally, we screened a list of 230 IRE-like sequences that were retrieved from the UTR data base (version from October, 2004, available at www.ba.itb.cnr.it/UTR/) (23Mignone F. Grillo G. Licciulli F. Iacono M. Liuni S. Kersey P.J. Duarte J. Saccone C. Pesole G. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: D141-D146Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). These putative IRE sequences match the PatSearch Pattern defined for the ferritin or TFRC IRE model sequences (23Mignone F. Grillo G. Licciulli F. Iacono M. Liuni S. Kersey P.J. Duarte J. Saccone C. Pesole G. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: D141-D146Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). After subtracting known IRE mRNAs, 141 putative IRE sequences remained. From these, we selected those that closely resemble an IRE structure with a lower stem containing at least six out of seven paired nucleotides. Only six IRE-like motifs remained after imposing this criterion (Table 1).TABLE 1Summary of IRE-like motifs identified biocomputationallyGene nameRef. sequenceSpecieIRE atIRE sequenceIRE in other speciesE IREaE, predicted IRE structure energy (14)ADARNM_001111H. sapiens5′GCCCCGGGGC.

Richter A. Gunkel N. Riedel D. Polycarpou-Schwarz M. Hentze S. Falkenhahn M. Stremmel W. Ansorge W. Hentze M.W. Blood. 2003; 101: 3690-3698Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar)), and 39 mouse EST sequences corresponding to 16 genes (out of 21) were spotted onto the murine IronChip microarray platform (versions 5.0, 6.0, and 7.0 (24Muckenthaler M. Roy C.N. Custodio A.O. Minana B. deGraaf J. Montross L.K. Andrews N.C. Hentze M.W. Nat. Genet. 2003; 34: 102-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar); see www.embl.de/iron-systems/IronChip_genes.html for updated versions of the Iron-Chip). For IronChip analyses, 5 μg of total RNA was reverse-transcribed, amplified, and labeled as described previously (20Muckenthaler M. Richter A. Gunkel N. Riedel D. Polycarpou-Schwarz M. Hentze S. Falkenhahn M. Stremmel W. Ansorge W. Hentze M.W. Blood. 2003; 101: 3690-3698Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). RT-PCR Experiments (qRT-PCR and Semiquantitative RT-PCR)—Total RNA was extracted from 293 cells, and 2 μg was used for first strand cDNAs synthesis with random primers and Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) was performed using SYBR green and an ABI 7500 sequence detection system instrument and software from Applied Biosystems. The data represent the average of three independent tissue culture experiments for which qRT-PCR analyses were performed in duplicate. mRNA expression ratios in DFO-treated versus control cells (untreated) were calculated using the comparative Ct method with correction for amplification efficiencies as described previously (25Pfaffl M.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: e45Crossref PubMed Scopus (25872) Google Scholar); values were normalized to β-actin mRNA levels. For qRT-PCR analysis of IRP/IRE mRNPs, 65 ng of immunopurified RNA from 786-O cells was reverse transcribed. mRNA levels were determined for three independent immunopurified experiments for which each qRT-PCR analysis was done in triplicate. For semiquantitative RT-PCR one-fifth or three-fifths of the RT sample, depending on mRNA abundance, was used for PCR amplification with Taq Platinum (Invitrogen) after RNase H treatment. The amplification was performed at 95 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 2.5 min for 16, 23, or 35 cycles depending on the concentration of the cDNA (β-actin, TFRC, or CDC14A, respectively). The PCR products were resolved on 1% ethidium bromide-stained gels where the predicted amplification product size was observed. For each set of primers, the number of PCR cycles was optimized for linearity of the reaction. Primers spanning the four different isoforms of CDC14A mRNA (1A-IRE, 1B-IRE, 1A-non-IRE, and 1B-non-IRE) were used under C, control (no treatment); H, hemin; D, DFO; or -RT, no RT enzyme added conditions. β-Actin and TFRC mRNAs were amplified as negative and positive controls for iron regulation, respectively. The primers used for the analysis are listed in supplemental Table S1. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—Gel-retardation analyses were performed as described previously (26Pantopoulos K. Hentze M.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1267-1271Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Briefly, a [32P]UTP-labeled human FTH1 IRE probe (600,000 cpm) was incubated with 10 ng of purified recombinant His-tagged IRP1 or IRP2 protein (21Gray N.K. Quick S. Goossen B. Constable A. Hirling H. Kuhn L.C. Hentze M.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 218: 657-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) for 15 min at 25 °C in the presence of increasing molar excess of unlabeled competitor probes. Non-specific RNA-protein interactions were displaced by the addition of 50 μg of sodium heparin for 10 min. Supershift experiments were performed by adding immunopurified rabbit polyclonal anti-IRP1 or anti-IRP2 antibodies (5Galy B. Ferring D. Hentze M.W. Genesis. 2005; 43: 181-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) for 10 min. RNA-protein complexes were resolved by nondenaturing PAGE and visualized using a PhosphorImager (Fujifilm FLA-2000, Amersham Biosciences). Strategy to Identify Novel IRE-containing mRNAs—To identify novel IRE-containing mRNAs we combined biochemical and biocomputational approaches coupled with microarray analysis (Fig. 1A). In this approach, IRP/IRE mRNPs were immunoselected, and their mRNA composition was analyzed using microarrays. The experimental strategy was validated using the IronChip (16Gray N.K. Pantopoulos K. Dandekar T. Ackrell B.A. Hentze M.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4925-4930Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), a specialized cDNA microarray platform established to study iron metabolism-related genes. The IronChip contains all known IRE genes and was complemented here specifically with cDNAs predicted to bear IRE-like sequences (see below). Immunopurification of IRP/IRE mRNPs—Total RNA from different sources was incubated with recombinant human IRP1 followed by immunoselection of IRP1/IRE mRNPs with an affinity-purified polyclonal rabbit anti-IRP1 antibody raised against full-length human IRP1 (5Galy B. Ferring D. Hentze M.W. Genesis. 2005; 43: 181-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar); in control reactions, the addition of recombinant IRP1 protein was omitted (Fig. 1A). In preliminary experiments, we had optimized the specificity and the yield of the procedure in terms of incubation conditions and amount of added recombinant IRP1, using radiolabeled in vitro transcribed reporter mRNAs bearing wild-type (positive control) and mutant (negative control) FTH1 IRE (data not shown). The input RNA was extracted from different human cell lines (HepG2: hepatoma, Caco-2: colon adenocarcinoma, HeLa: cervix adenocarcinoma, MCF7: breast adenocarcinoma, K562: erythroleukemia, TPH1: myeloid leukemia, 293: embryonic kidney cells, and 786-O: renal adenocarcinoma) and mouse tissues (liver, spleen, brain, duodenum, heart, lung, and kidney). Prior to RNA extraction, mice and cell lines were made iron-deficient to increase the abundance of IRE-containing mRNAs like the TFRC and SLC11A2 (DMT1) mRNAs. Following optimization, the efficiency and the specificity of the immunoselection procedure were confirmed by testing the levels of four known IRE-containing mRNAs (Tfrc, Slc40a1 or Ireg1, Ftl or ferritin light polypeptide, and Fth1 or ferritin heavy polypeptide 1) as positive controls together with negative controls in the immunoprecipitated (IP) and in the supernatant (SN) fractions by Northern blotting. As shown in Fig. 1B, all four positive control mRNAs were significantly enriched in the IP fraction (compare lanes 3 and 5) and depleted from the SN fraction (compare lanes 2 and 4) in an IRP1-dependent, specific manner. The degree of depletion from the SN varied among the four mRNAs, with a more effective depletion of the Tfrc and the Fth1 and Ftl mRNAs than the Slc40a1 mRNA. This difference may arise from the hierarchy of affinities of the IRE-containing mRNAs for IRP1. Importantly, negative control mRNAs devoid of IRE motifs (β-actin and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) were neither enriched in the IP fraction nor depleted from the SN (see lanes 2 and 3, Fig. 1B). Because SLC11A2 isoforms (IRE versus non-IRE) cannot be distinguished by Northern blotting, we also analyzed the IP fractions from three independent experiments by qRT-PCR. In agreement with the Northern blot data (Fig. 1B) the FTH1 and FTL mRNAs, as well as the TFRC mRNA, were strongly enriched in the IP fraction (46.9 ± 5-fold, 22.7 ± 5-fold, and 22.6 ± 15-fold, respectively) (Fig. 1C). In addition, the SLC11A2-IRE mRNA isoforms were selectively enriched in the IP fraction (21.0 ± 12-fold), whereas the non-IRE isoforms expectedly behaved as negative control (0.4 ± 0.4-fold) confirming the high selectivity and specificity of the procedure. Taken together, these data show that the immunoselection strategy efficiently and selectively isolates IRE-containing mRNAs. Biocomputational Identification of Novel IRE-like Motifs— IRE-like motifs were identified from genomic nucleic acid databases by an algorithm combining primary nucleic acid sequence and RNA structural criteria (14Bengert P. Dandekar T. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3441-3445Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 23Mignone F. Grillo G. Licciulli F. Iacono M. Liuni S. Kersey P.J. Duarte J. Saccone C. Pesole G. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: D141-D146Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Depending on the choice of constraining criteria, such computational screens tend to generate a large number of false positives. To refine the search and reduce the number of false positive hits, additional constraints were introduced. First, we restricted the positive hits to those whose IRE folding energy was consistent with the energy of known IREs (at least -3 kcal/mol or below). In addition, putative 5′-IRE motifs had to be located within the first 200 nucleotides of the mRNA leader, because the distance between functional 5′-IREs and the cap structure has been shown to be critical for efficient translational repression in mammals (27Goossen B. Hentze M.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1959-1966Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Such criteria identify all known 5′-IREs, including the experimentally confirmed IRE in SLC40A1 (28Lymboussaki A. Pignatti E. Montosi G. Garuti C. Haile D.J. Pietrangelo A. J. Hepatol. 2003; 39: 710-715Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). For 3′-IRE motifs, only those conserved in at least two different species were selected. This refined screen yielded 15 IRE motifs (4 within the 5′-UTR and 11 within the 3′-UTR) (Table 1). A second approach made use of a reported list of 230 IRE-like sequences obtained from screening UTR databases (23Mignone F. Grillo G. Licciulli F. Iacono M. Liuni S. Kersey P.J. Duarte J. Saccone C. Pesole G. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: D141-D146Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). We selected 6 out of these 230 entries based on the ability of the lower IRE stem to form at least 6 out of 7 bp (Table 1). Thus, 21 mRNAs with IRE-like motifs were selected in total. Corresponding ESTs were spotted onto the human or mouse versions of the IronChip, a sensitive cDNA microarray platform covering ∼500 genes involved in iron metabolism and connected metabolic pathways (e.g. copper and oxygen metabolism) (20Muckenthaler M. Richter A. Gunkel N. Riedel D. Polycarpou-Schwarz M. Hentze S. Falkenhahn M. Stremmel W. Ansorge W. Hentze M.W. Blood. 2003; 101: 3690-3698Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W2117627937,"Research into the evolution of giant sperm has uncovered a paradox within the foundations of sexual selection theory. Postcopulatory sexual selection on males (that is, sperm competition and cryptic female choice) can lead to decreased sperm numbers by favouring the production of larger sperm. However, a decline in sperm numbers is predicted to weaken selection on males and increase selection on females. As isogamy is approached (that is, as investment per gamete by males approaches that by females), sperm become less abundant, ova become relatively less rare, and competition between males for fertilization success is predicted to weaken. Sexual selection for longer sperm, therefore, is expected to be self limiting. Here we examine this paradox in Drosophila along the anisogamy-isogamy continuum using intraspecific experimental evolution techniques and interspecific comparative techniques. Our results confirm the big-sperm paradox by showing that the sex difference in sexual selection gradients decreases as sperm size increases. However, a resolution to the paradox is provided when this finding is interpreted in concert with the 'opportunity for selection' and the 'opportunity for sexual selection'. Furthermore, we show that most of the variation in measures of selection intensity is explained by sperm length and relative investment in sperm production."
https://openalex.org/W2033758544,"The mitochondrial outer membrane contains two distinct machineries for protein import and protein sorting that function in a sequential manner: the general translocase of the outer membrane (TOM complex) and the sorting and assembly machinery (SAM complex), which is dedicated to β-barrel proteins. The SAMcore complex consists of three subunits, Sam35, Sam37, and Sam50, that can associate with a fourth subunit, the morphology component Mdm10, to form the SAMholo complex. Whereas the SAMcore complex is required for the biogenesis of all β-barrel proteins, Mdm10 and the SAMholo complex play a selective role in β-barrel biogenesis by promoting assembly of Tom40 but not of porin. We report that Tom7, a conserved subunit of the TOM complex, functions in an antagonistic manner to Mdm10 in biogenesis of Tom40 and porin. We show that Tom7 promotes segregation of Mdm10 from the SAMholo complex into a low molecular mass form. Upon deletion of Tom7, the fraction of Mdm10 in the SAMholo complex is significantly increased, explaining the opposing functions of Tom7 and Mdm10 in β-barrel sorting. Thus the role of Tom7 is not limited to the TOM complex.

Preproteins carrying cleavable amino-terminal targeting signals (presequences) are transferred from the TOM complex to the presequence translocase of the inner membrane (TIM23 complex) and then sorted to matrix and inner membrane. Many mitochondrial proteins, however, are synthesized without cleavable presequences, including all outer membrane proteins and the majority of intermembrane space and inner membrane proteins. These proteins use distinct import and sorting machineries. Thus, in addition to the presequence pathway, three sorting pathways for non-cleavable mitochondrial precursor proteins have been identified, each of them starting at the TOM complex. Many hydrophobic inner membrane proteins, including the abundant metabolite carriers, are imported via small Tim proteins of the intermembrane space and the twin pore translocase of the inner membrane (TIM22 complex) (8Koehler C.M.

Small proteins of the intermembrane space use a special import and assembly machinery that includes Mia40 and the sulfhydryl oxidase Erv1 (13Chacinska A. Pfannschmidt S. Wiedemann N. Kozjak V.

Outer membrane proteins are also initially transported via the TOM complex; however, the TOM complex is not able to integrate β-barrel proteins into the membrane. Therefore, the outer membrane contains a separate sorting and assembly machinery (SAM complex) that directs membrane integration and assembly of β-barrel proteins, including the abundant proteins porin and Tom40 (8Koehler C.M.

The precursors of β-barrel proteins are first imported by the TOM complex to the intermembrane space side of the outer membrane.

Whereas the SAMcore complex is required for sorting of all β-barrel outer membrane proteins analyzed, the SAMholo complex is dedicated to assembly of the TOM complex, i.e. Mdm10 is selectively required for the final steps of assembly of Tom40 but not porin (34Meisinger C.

The TOM complex consists of seven different subunits, three receptor proteins, the central channel-forming protein Tom40, and three small Tom proteins (7Stojanovski D. Johnston A.J. Streimann I.

In particular, the function of Tom7, which is well conserved in evolution, is unclear as various findings with pleiotropic and in part contradictory results have been reported. Tom7 was found to function at the trans side of the TOM complex by increasing the efficiency of protein transport to internal mitochondrial compartments (42Hönlinger A. Bömer U. Alconada A.

A conceptual problem arose, however, when the role of Tom7 in biogenesis of Tom40 was analyzed. Although Tom40 and porin are both imported via TOM and SAM, the efficiency of Tom40 assembly was even enhanced by the absence of Tom7 (18Wiedemann N. Kozjak V. Chacinska A. Schönfisch B. Rospert S.

Moreover, yeast cells lacking Tom7 showed altered mitochondrial morphology (34Meisinger C. Rissler M. Chacinska A. Sanjuán Szklarz L.K. Milenkovic D. Kozjak V. Schönfisch B. Lohaus C. Meyer H.E.

In this report we have addressed the apparently conflicting results on the function of Tom7. We observed that cells lacking Tom7 displayed significantly stronger defects in mitochondrial morphology than cells lacking the other small Tom proteins, Tom5 and Tom6, pointing to a possible relation of Tom7 to morphology components. A direct comparison of the assembly pathways of Tom40 and porin in tom7Δ and mdm10Δ mitochondria revealed antagonistic effects of Tom7 and Mdm10. We show that Tom7 exerts an inhibitory effect on Mdm10 by promoting its segregation from the SAMholo complex into a low molecular mass form, implying a new mechanism for mitochondrial protein sorting.

Images of cells with representative phenotypes were taken using an upright confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss AG) equipped with a differential interference contrast optic, a ×63 objective (Plan Apochromat, numeric aperture 1.4, Carl Zeiss AG), and LSM 510 Meta software. Fluorescent mitochondria were illuminated by an argon laser (Lasos GmbH) using an HFT 488 filter and an LP 505 filter.

We directly compared the mitochondrial morphology of yeast mutants of each of the small Tom proteins by confocal laser scanning microscopy. When yeast cells were grown at 28 °C, the majority of tom7Δ cells displayed aberrant (aggregated/giant) mitochondrial shapes, whereas most tom5Δ and tom6Δ cells showed a normal tubular mitochondrial morphology like wild-type cells (Fig. 1 and Table 1). Upon growth of the cells at elevated temperature (37 °C), aggregated/giant mitochondrial shapes were observed in the majority of cells from deletion mutants of all three small Tom proteins (Table 1). We compared the tom mutants to deletion mutants of the SAMcore and SAMholo complexes. The morphology defect of sam37Δ cells (34Meisinger C. Rissler M. Chacinska A. Sanjuán Szklarz L.K. Milenkovic D.

Thus, the expression of morphological phenotypes (alteration of mitochondrial shape) in tom7Δ cells showed more similarity to that in mdm10Δ cells than to those in mutants of the other small Tom proteins or Sam37. These findings raised the possibility that Tom7 exerts a function with relation to mitochondrial morphology components.TABLE 1Mitochondrial morphology of Saccharomyces cerevisiae mutant cells Yeast cells were grown overnight at 28 or 37 °C to mid-log phase.

For human membrane-bound cytochromes P450, the oxy complex is believed to be the primary source of cytotoxic superoxide and peroxide, although information on the properties and stability of this intermediate is lacking. Here we document stopped-flow spectroscopic studies of the formation and decay of the oxy-ferrous complex in the most abundant human cytochrome P450 (CYP3A4) as a function of temperature in the substrate-free and substrate-bound form. CYP3A4 solubilized in purified monomeric form in nanoscale POPC bilayers is functionally and kinetically homogeneous. In substrate-free CYP3A4, the oxy complex is extremely unstable with a half-life of ∼30 ms at 5 °C. Saturation with testosterone or bromocriptine stabilizes the oxy-ferrous intermediate. Comparison of the autoxidation rates with the available data on CYP3A4 turnover kinetics suggests that the oxy complex may be an important route for uncoupling.

Cytochrome P450 CYP3A4 is the most prevalent P450 monooxygenase in human liver and is responsible for the metabolism of almost half of xenobiotics encountered by man (1Guengerich F.P. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Cytochrome P450: Structure, Mechanism, and Biochemistry. 3rd Ed. Kluwer Academic Publishers/Plenum Publishing Corp., New York2005: 377-530Crossref Scopus (282) Google Scholar). This isozyme has a large and flexible active site and is able to bind and catalytically convert multiple substrates, often displaying homotropic and heterotropic cooperativity in substrate binding and product formation. As a central player in human drug metabolism, CYP3A4 is one of the most intensely studied P450s, either in isolated human liver microsomes (2Guengerich F.P. Johnson W.W.

Despite this structural information, precise chemical and biophysical characterization of the human P450s has lagged that of the monomeric, soluble P450 isozymes isolated from bacteria. In particular, the critical intermediates in the reaction cycle of human P450s have not been precisely documented, due in part to the inability to form a robust, monomeric, and soluble entity that is amenable to the rapid reaction and spectroscopic methodologies successfully applied to the bacterial P450s. This lacuna is significant, as CYP3A4 and other human P450s display complex aspects of substrate recognition and catalytic mechanism that are not present in the simpler P450s such as CYP101 from Pseudomonas. The current version of the catalytic reaction cycle of cytochrome P450 monooxygenases involves intermediate reduction states of heme iron and atmospheric dioxygen and represents the result of over 30 years of intensive research (11Makris T.M. Davydov R. Denisov I.G. Hoffman B.M. Sligar S.G. Drug Metab. Rev. 2002; 34: 691-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 12Denisov I.G. Makris T.M. Sligar S.G. Schlichting I. Chem. Rev. 2005; 105: 2253-2278Crossref PubMed Scopus (1566) Google Scholar). Traditionally, the cyclic process begins with the ferric low spin species and a water molecule occupying the sixth coordination site of the heme. In many cases the complementary fit of the native substrate into the pocket displaces this water ligand allowing the system to assume a predominantly high spin electronic configuration, although in some instances substrates may induce only partial spin shift (13Fisher M.T. Sligar S.G. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 4797-4803Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 14Loida P.J. Sligar S.G. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11530-11538Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Electron transfer from a redox partner reduces the iron to the ferrous form which then can bind atmospheric dioxygen. The resultant ferrous-oxy complex in the P450 cytochromes is analogous to that of oxygenated hemoglobin and myoglobin. However, in the case of the P450s, the axial thiolate ligand and the facile interaction with redox partners allows a second electron input to elicit dioxygen bond scission, the production of water, and generation of an active heme-oxidant capable of substrate functionalization. Thus, the ferrous dioxygen intermediate is the key juncture between reversible dioxygen transport and oxygenase metabolism. A major step in the understanding of the P450 mechanism came in the early 1970s when two groups observed the ferrousoxy state in the P450 CYP101 camphor hydroxylase from Pseudomonas putida (15Peterson J.A. Ishimura Y. Griffin B.W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1972; 149: 197-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 16Lipscomb J.D. Sligar S.G. Namtvedt M.J. Gunsalus I.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 1116-1124Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similar experiments carried out by Coon and co-workers (17Oprian D.D. Gorsky L.D. Coon M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 8684-8691Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with P450LM2 and P450LM4 were less successful, because of the relative instability of this state and the aggregate nature of these purified preparations. In the ensuing 30 years, despite the importance of this intermediate in P450 catalysis, the observation and characterization of the oxy-ferrous intermediate in mammalian cytochromes P450 have been problematic. In several cases the oxy complex was reported with heterogeneous kinetic properties, which were variously attributed to an essential complex behavior of the enzyme, to the presence of multiple populations of aggregated forms of P450, or both. This ambiguity leaves many unanswered mechanistic questions about the specific roles of different substrates as determinants of cytochrome P450 kinetics and in the degree of coupling of redox equivalent consumption to product formation. Guengerich and co-workers (2Guengerich F.P. Johnson W.W. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14741-14750Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 18Guengerich F.P. Biol. Chem. 2002; 383: 1553-1564Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) have published several important works in the initial characterization of the rate-limiting steps of CYP3A4 catalysis, together with detailed kinetic modeling. In this study, we make use of a self-assembled nanoscale phospholipid bilayer to stabilize human CYP3A4 as a soluble, robust, and monomeric entity. In this system, the cytochrome is present in its native membrane-bound configuration, and the robustness of the monodisperse preparation allows rapid mix stopped-flow measurements. We report here the isolation and detailed spectral characterization of the oxy-ferrous state of CYP3A4, document the dependence of the autoxidation rate on the substrate presence, and analyze these kinetics in terms of a model of redox coupled dioxygen and superoxide interaction with the ferric/ferrous hemoprotein. Expression and Purification of CYP3A4—Cytochrome P450 3A4 was expressed from the NF-14 construct in the PCWori+ vector with a C-terminal pentahistidine tag generously provided by Guengerich and co-workers (19Gillam E.M.J. Baba T. Kim B.R. Ohmori S. Guengerich F.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 305: 123-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). The presence of the His tag does not perturb turnover parameters of CYP3A4 (20Domanski T.L. Liu J. Harlow G.R. Halpert J.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 350: 223-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Heterologous expression and purification from Escherichia coli were carried out using a modified procedure (21Baas B.J. Denisov I.G. Sligar S.G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2004; 430: 218-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) as described in the supplemental material. CYP3A4-Nanodiscs were prepared in a substrate-free form and kept at 4 °C. The application of the Nanodisc system for solubilization of integral membrane proteins incorporated into nanoscale bilayers has been described in detail in several publications (21Baas B.J. Denisov I.G. Sligar S.G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2004; 430: 218-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 22Bayburt T.H. Grinkova Y.V. Sligar S.G.

Sligar S.G. Schuler M.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2004; 424: 141-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Assembly of human CYP3A4 in Nanodiscs was accomplished using the scaffold protein MSP1D1 with the poly(histidine) tag (26Denisov I.G. Grinkova Y.V. Lazarides A.A. Sligar S.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004; 126: 3477-3487Crossref PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar) removed as described previously (21Baas B.J. Denisov I.G. Sligar S.G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2004; 430: 218-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Briefly, purified CYP3A4 from the E. coli expression system was solubilized by 0.1% Emulgen 913 and mixed with a disk reconstitution mixture containing MSP1D1, POPC, 2The abbreviations used are: POPC, 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine; BC, bromocriptine; SVD, singular value decomposition; TS, testosterone. and sodium cholate present in 1:65:130 molar ratios. Detergents were removed by treatment with Biobeads (Bio-Rad), which initiates self-assembly. The result of this self-assembly reaction is a monomer of CYP3A4 contained in a discoidal POPC bilayer ∼10 nm in diameter stabilized by the encircling amphipathic membrane scaffold protein belt (see Supplemental Material). Substrate Binding—Formation and decay of the oxy-ferrous complex was studied for CYP3A4 saturated with testosterone (TS, 200 μm) or bromocriptine (BC, 3 μm) and in the substrate-free form. Substrates were added using stock solutions in methanol with the final concentration of methanol always less than 1%. Representative examples of spectral titration of CYP3A4 Nanodiscs with TS were published earlier (21Baas B.J. Denisov I.G. Sligar S.G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2004; 430: 218-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) and with BC are shown in supplemental Fig. 2S. For both substrates, a spin conversion higher than 90% was reached at saturating concentrations, confirming the structural and functional homogeneity of CYP3A4 in Nanodiscs (21Baas B.J. Denisov I.G. Sligar S.G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2004; 430: 218-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), and in agreement with the recent study of reduction kinetics of CYP3A4 (27Davydov D.R. Fernando H. Baas B.J. Sligar S.G. Halpert J.R. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 13902-13913Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Solutions of CYP3A4 in Nanodiscs were deaerated under the flow of argon gas and reduced by addition of a small excess of anaerobically prepared dithionite solution with the concentration determined using a molar absorption coefficient ϵ315 = 8.05 mm–1 cm–1 (28McKenna C.E. Gutheil W.G. Song W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1075: 109-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Complete reduction was confirmed by anaerobic absorption spectroscopy. Stopped-flow Experiments—All stopped-flow experiments utilized an Applied Photophysics SX.18MV stopped-flow spectrophotometer using typical mixing volumes of 150 μl in each syringe with a dead time of 1.5 ms. Anaerobic solutions of reduced CYP3A4 Nanodiscs (with or without substrate) in one syringe were mixed in 1:1 ratio with buffer saturated with pure oxygen gas containing the same concentration of substrate, if present. The resulting high oxygen concentration (∼690 μm after mixing) was chosen in order to accelerate formation of the oxy complex. Replicate experiments were completed at different temperatures from 5 to 37 °C. In each experiment from 400 to 800 spectra were collected on a logarithmic time scale for the slow reactions (total collection time 50 s) or linear time scale for faster processes (collection time up to 1 s). The integrity of CYP3A4 Nanodisc after stopped-flow mixing was tested in separate experiments by size-exclusion high pressure liquid chromatography, and the samples appeared indistinguishable from those before the stopped-flow experiments. Data Analysis—The resulting data were analyzed according to Equation 1, Fe2++O2→k1Fe2+O2→k2Fe3++O2·(Eq. 1) where Fe2+ and Fe3+ denote the reduced (ferrous) and oxidized (ferric) state of CYP3A4 heme iron; k1 is the apparent pseudo first-order rate constant of oxygen binding to ferrous cytochrome P450, and k2 is the rate constant for autoxidation, i.e. formation of ferric CYP3A4 and release of superoxide. In most experiments oxygen binding was complete within the dead time of the instrument, and k1 could only be approximated. In case of CYP3A4 saturated with BC at low temperatures, however, formation of the oxy complex was slow enough to resolve as a separate process completed during the first 30–40 ms after mixing. Spectra collected in each kinetic experiment were arranged into a matrix with each column vector representing the spectra, and rows representing the absorption at each wavelength as a function of time. The number of independent spectrally distinguishable components and their time-dependent concentrations were determined using singular value decomposition (SVD) (29Henry E.R. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 652-673Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). For substrate-free CYP3A4 as well as for the experiments conducted in the presence of TS, only two spectral components corresponding to the spectra of oxy-ferrous and the final ferric P450 were derived from the spectral data sets. In the case of CYP3A4 saturated with BC, the initial oxygen binding was slower than in other samples, and in the third component, the initial spectrum of deoxy-ferrous CYP3A4 was also possible to discern. The spectra of pure species and rate constants were also calculated using the program SPECFIT (Spectrum Software Associates, Marlborough, MA). The ferrous-oxy complex of the cytochromes P450 is at the critical bifurcation point between a commitment to oxygenase catalysis and simple reversible dissociation of atmospheric dioxygen. This transient intermediate was isolated and characterized in the microbial P450 CYP101 from Pseudomonas by spectroscopic methods (30Dawson J.H. Kau L.S. Penner-Hahn J.E. Sono M. Eble K.S. Bruce G.S.

Sligar G. Science. 2000; 287: 1615-1622Crossref PubMed Scopus (1204) Google Scholar). Similar structural and functional characterization of the ferrous-oxy complex in mammalian cytochromes P450 has met with significant frustrations due to the membrane-bound nature of these monooxygenases and the difficulty in generating a monomeric and monodisperse solution preparation for biophysical investigations. Using the Nanodisc self-assembled phospholipid bilayer system (22Bayburt T.H. Grinkova Y.V. Sligar S.G. Nano Lett. 2002; 2: 853-856Crossref Scopus (556) Google Scholar), we incorporated human CYP3A4 into a homogeneous preparation and characterized the fundamental substrate-binding isotherms. With both substrates used in this work, the spin conversion upon saturation was higher than 90%, indicating functional homogeneity in equilibrium titration experiments. Fig. 1A shows spectra and decay kinetics of the oxy complex of CYP3A4 in Nanodiscs without substrate present. The spectrum of the oxy complex shows a Soret band at 418 nm and a single broad maximum at 552 nm in the visible region. This spectrum looks very similar to the spectra of bacterial oxygenated cytochromes P450 (15Peterson J.A. Ishimura Y. Griffin B.W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1972; 149: 197-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 35Eisenstein L. Debey P. Douzou P. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

The rate of autoxidation of substrate-free CYP3A4 in Nanodiscs is very high, k = 20 s–1 at 5 °C and ∼140 s–1 at 29 °C. Because of extremely fast decomposition of the oxy complex, it was impossible to measure the rate of this reaction at the physiological temperature of 37 °C. This means that, even if reduction of the substrate-free CYP3A4 is possible in vivo, the oxy complex, once formed, would decompose much faster than the subsequent steps of enzymatic catalysis. Such fast autoxidation reactions have not been reported previously for other cytochromes P450 (Table 1).TABLE 1Observed autoxidation rates for cytochromes P450P450SubstrateTemperatureRateSourceKs-1CYP101+Sub278-2930.0003-0.004349+Cam2930.005-0.0116MutantsT252A or T252V+Cam2830.003-0.00559CYP102-Sub2880.02-0.4651+Sub2880.013-0.37+Sub277-2930.025-0.2249CYP108+Sub277-2930.0007-0.01749CYP119-Sub2780.0860CYP158+Sub2960.042-0.0961CYP1A2NR2770.2-0.862CYP2A6+Sub2960.363CYP2B4+Sub2880.0964CYP3A4No substrate278-30220-140This workTestosterone279-3100.37-20Bromocriptine279-3100.12-2.5CYP11A1+Sub2770.0147 Open table in a new tab The results of stopped-flow experiments with CYP3A4 saturated with TS are shown in Fig. 1B. The oxy complex is formed within several milliseconds after mixing a deoxygenated solution of reduced CYP3A4 with oxygen. Even at low temperatures, e.g. 6 °C, the apparent first-order rate of oxygen binding could only be estimated as 350–400 s–1, corresponding to a second-order rate of 5 × 105 m–1 s–1. At higher temperatures, oxygen binding is completed even faster and could not be measured with the current experimental methodologies. The spectra of the oxy complex of CYP3A4 saturated with TS shows a broad Soret band with a Soret maximum at 424–425 nm, which is red-shifted as compared with the 418–420 nm values observed for the oxy complex of other cytochromes P450 and resembles the spectra of oxygenated nitric-oxide synthase and chloroperoxidase, which also have thiolate as a proximal ligand to the heme iron. This shift may be caused by the specific perturbation of the heme and/or dioxygen ligand by substrate molecule bound in the active site of CYP3A4, as was suggested recently for nitric-oxide synthase (37Berka V. Yeh H.C. Gao D. Kiran F. Tsai A.L. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 13137-13148Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 38Wei C.C. Wang Z.Q. Durra D. Hemann C. Hille R. Garcin E.D. Getzoff E.D. Stuehr D.J.

Chem. 2006; 281: 9623-9632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The shape of absorption spectra of the CYP3A4 oxy complex with TS bound and the positions of the main absorption bands do not depend on temperature in the range from 6 to 37 °C. Similar results were obtained with CYP3A4 saturated with BC. Representative spectra of the CYP3A4 oxy complex with BC bound are shown in Fig. 1C. For these samples oxygen binding was slower by an order of magnitude, with the apparent first-order binding rates ranging from 24 s–1 at 6 °C to ∼300 s–1 at 32 °C (data not shown). At all temperatures the spectra of the oxy complex look very similar, with the Soret maximum at 420 nm. Once formed, the oxygenated CYP3A4 quickly autoxidizes via a single exponential process with no spectrally distinguishable intermediates. SVD analysis of experimental data shows that all data sets can be described with high precision with only two basis spectra corresponding to oxygenated and high spin ferric CYP3A4. At the lowest temperatures, several spectra measured at the first 10 ms with TS and within the first 20–120 ms with BC were omitted from such analyses, because they revealed the presence of ferrous CYP3A4 before oxygenation was completed. Kinetics of autoxidation of substrate-free CYP3A4 and of CYP3A4 in the presence of substrates at different temperatures is shown in Fig. 2 together with the corresponding fits to the single-exponential decay. Careful analysis of the data obtained for CYP3A4 in the presence of 3 μm BC reveals the presence of the second process with a typical amplitude of 15–20% at all temperatures. This second process can be tentatively attributed to the presence of several conformers of CYP3A4 and/or multiple BC binding modes, which are in slow equilibrium on the time scale of our experiments. Because the major fraction of autoxidation kinetics could be approximated reasonably well with a single-exponential decay, we used the same simple model to fit the data obtained with BC to compare the influence of two different substrates on the autoxidation rates and to calculate the activation parameters of this reaction. Both substrates were found to significantly stabilize the oxy complex against autoxidation. With BC this effect is more pronounced, the rates of spontaneous decomposition of oxygenated CYP3A4 vary from 0.12 s–1 at 6 °C to 2.6 s–1 at 37 °C. With TS the rates at the same temperatures are 0.37 and 20 s–1, i.e. 3–8 times higher. The stabilizing effect of the substrate on the oxy complex in CYP3A4 is slightly more pronounced with BC and is the same with TS as compared with that in CYP101 with camphor (16Lipscomb J.D. Sligar S.G. Namtvedt M.J. Gunsalus I.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 1116-1124Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The kinetics of autoxidation of heme proteins at high oxygen concentration is determined mostly by the rate of direct escape of superoxide or hydroperoxyl radical from the binding pocket (40Brantley Jr., R.E.

Rev. 1998; 98: 1357-1374Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar), although the experimentally observed rate of decay of the oxy-ferrous complex may also depend on possible nucleophilic ligand displacement (42Shikama K. Chem. Rev. 1998; 98: 1357-1374Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 43Shikama K. Biol. Rev. Camb. Philos. Soc. 1990; 65: 517-527Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 44Shikama K. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 2006; 91: 83-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The differences observed between the autoxidation rates measured in CYP3A4 saturated with BC versus TS imply that the presence of substrates could modulate the escape of superoxide from the distal binding pocket of the protein. The rates of autoxidation measured at 24 °C, 3.6 s–1 for TS and 0.84 s–1 for BC, are of the same order as the dissociation rates of these substrates, 20 s–1 and 0.25 s–1 at 23 °C (45Isin E.M. Guengerich F.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 9127-9136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). For substrate-free protein, autoxidation at 6 °C is 60 times faster than with TS, and more than 150 times faster than with BC. However, autoxidation is very fast, even in case of substrate-saturated CYP3A4, and is much faster than in other cytochromes P450. This suggests that autoxidation may be a key factor that determines the uncoupling behavior and production of toxic superoxide by cytochromes P450 in humans. The temperature dependences of autoxidation rates were analyzed according to the Eyring equation in order to derive the activation enthalpies and entropies of this reaction in the absence and in the presence of substrates (46Franke A. Stochel G. Jung C. Van Eldik R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004; 126: 4181-4191Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). For CYP3A4, we obtained similar free energies of activation (Fig. 3) to those measured for CYP101 (16Lipscomb J.D. Sligar S.G. Namtvedt M.J. Gunsalus I.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 1116-1124Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and CYP11A1 (47Hume R. Kelly R.W. Taylor P.L. Boyd G.S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1984; 140: 583-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 48Tuckey R.C. Kamin H. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 9309-9314Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanism of autoxidation in CYP3A4 is likely the same, but the rates are faster by 2–3 orders of magnitude both with and without substrate. Analysis shows that the activation entropy provides a more significant contribution to the temperature dependence of autoxidation rate measured for TS-saturated CYP3A4 than for the BC-CYP3A4 complex. This may indicate the difference in the active site volume available to the superoxide prior to its escape from the interior of the protein molecule. In well characterized systems such as CYP101 (16Lipscomb J.D. Sligar S.G. Namtvedt M.J. Gunsalus I.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 1116-1124Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Eisenstein L.

Biochem. 2006; 100: 1075-1090Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), the overall stability of the oxy complex is known to depend on the presence of the substrate. However, in these bacterial cytochromes P450, the consumption of pyridine nucleotide is effectively coupled with product formation, and this first branch point does not contribute significantly to the overall uncoupling because the overall turnover rates are typically 10–40 s–1, i.e. much faster than the autoxidation rates of the oxy complex, which are in the range of 0.002–0.05 s–1 in these enzymes. On the contrary, product formation in human cytochromes P450 is usually much slower, 0.02–0.25 s–1, and significantly lower than the rates of spontaneous decomposition of the oxy complex in CYP3A4 measured in this work. The essential feature of these P450s is the overall high degree of uncoupling, which though well established in general, but usually is not assigned to any specific step of P450 cycle (for review see Ref. 52Zangar R.C. Davydov D.R. Verma S. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 2004; 199: 316-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). Our results provide new information on the properties of oxygenated CYP3A4 solubilized in monomeric form in a POPC bilayer. We show that CYP3A4 in Nanodiscs is monodisperse and kinetically homogeneous with respect to formation and oxidative decomposition of oxy-ferrous complex. Without substrate, the oxy complex in CYP3A4 autoxidizes very quickly and returns to the ferric low spin state. Saturation of CYP3A4 with TS or BC significantly stabilizes this oxy-ferrous state. This effect is similar to the pronounced stabilization of other cytochromes P450 by their substrates against autoxidation, and together with the dramatic acceleration of reduction rate by the same substrates, it may be attributed to a positive shift of redox potential caused by substrate binding to cytochromes P450. The possibility of essential uncoupling of NADPH consumption by microsomal cytochrome P450 through the direct decomposition of oxy-ferrous complex and the dependence of this process on the enzyme saturation by substrate has been suggested previously (53Ullrich V. Kuthan H. Dev. Biochem. 1980; 13: 267-272Google Scholar). For most of the well characterized cytochromes P450, the autoxidation rates are lower than the total rate of pyridine nucleotide consumption and the rate of catalytic turnover. For the case of CYP3A4 in the absence of substrate, however, the oxy complex decomposes extremely quickly and likely is not stable enough to be effectively reduced to the peroxo level as required for monooxygenase catalysis. The latter kinetic selection may serve as an additional mechanism of regulation of NADPH consumption through coupling with the substrate binding, together with the known thermodynamic trigger, spin shift, and acceleration of the first reduction rate (54Sligar S.G. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 5399-5406Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Further experimental studies focused on other reaction steps are needed to complete the kinetic characterization of the full enzymatic cycle of CYP3A4 and to elucidate the relative roles in total uncoupling at three branching intermediates, namely the oxy-ferrous, peroxo- and hydroperoxo-ferric, and ferryl-oxo heme complexes. The kinetic partitioning between the productive pathway and abortive decay of these intermediates critically depends on their stability as well as on the efficiency of the electron transfer from cytochrome P450 reductase and possibly other components, for example cytochrome b5. The overall results of such in vitro studies depend on the stoichiometry of all proteins in the reconstituted system as well as on other factors. To our knowledge there are no available data on the rate of the reduction of oxy-ferrous intermediate for CYP3A4 or any other mammalian membrane-bound cytochrome P450. However, the rate of spontaneous oxidative decomposition documented in this study for the oxygenated CYP3A4 saturated with TS, 20 s–1 at the physiological temperature of 37 °C, can be used as the reference value for the estimation of the efficiency of the second electron transfer and for the uncoupling ratio at the first branch point. If the reduction of the oxygenated CYP3A4 is also 20 s–1 at the same conditions, the uncoupling due to autoxidation will be at least 50%. If it is slower, the major fraction of redox equivalents from reductase will be consumed through this autoxidation pathway with concomitant release of superoxide. This latter option is in agreement with the direct comparison of NADPH oxidation rate and superoxide production by human microsomes enriched in CYP3A4 (4Puntarulo S. Cederbaum A.I. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1998; 24: 1324-1330Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). In summary, we report the formation and decay of the oxy complex in CYP3A4 with and without bound substrates. The use of Nanodiscs for solubilization and isolation of monomeric functional CYP3A4 incorporated in POPC bilayer provides a stable and homogeneous enzyme preparation. Previous work (21Baas B.J. Denisov I.G. Sligar S.G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2004; 430: 218-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) noted that CYP3A4 in Nanodiscs undergoes almost 100% conversion upon saturation with TS at 293 K. In this work the same complete conversion to the high spin state was obtained upon saturation with TS and BC at the physiological temperature range. Oxygen binding to the reduced CYP3A4 in stopped-flow experiments generates a transient oxy complex, also with 100% yield, and autoxidation of CYP3A4 with and without substrate is well described by single exponential decay. In all cases the final reoxidized protein remains fully functional. These results suggest that the autoxidation is a very important process for the overall uncoupling reactions of human liver cytochromes P450. The lifetime of the oxy complex in the absence of substrate is negligible as compared with the NADPH consumption rate measured for substrate-free CYP3A4 (2Guengerich F.P. Johnson W.W.

For the substrate-bound CYP3A4 autoxidation is also fast, and with TS bound at 310 K, it is much faster than turnover measured in vitro (55Daiber A. Schoneich C. Schmidt P. Jung C. Ullrich V. J. Inorg. Biochem. 2000; 81: 213-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 56Hosea N.A. Miller G.P. Guengerich F.P.

Our results suggest that the oxy-ferrous intermediate of the P450 cycle may be the most important natural determinant of CYP3A4 activity and human drug metabolism. It represents the first branching point between the productive pathway of the substrate turnover and the abortive decay with the formation of superoxide. The coupling of redox equivalent consumption with the substrate turnover at this step of the P450 catalytic cycle is determined by the lifetime of the oxy complex, which must be sufficiently stable to permit the second electron transfer from P450 reductase. The presence of substrate at this step is critically important for stabilization of oxygenated CYP3A4, for the efficient use of redox equivalents, and for minimization of the side reaction generating toxic superoxide and peroxide. These observations help to understand the multiple regulatory roles of substrates in the physiological functioning of CYP3A4. We thank Dr. F. P. Guengerich (Vanderbilt University) for the CYP3A4 expression system and Dr. R. B. Gennis (University of Illinois) for use of the stopped-flow instrument. Download .pdf (.18 MB) Help with pdf files"

The repression and activation activity of nuclear receptors are determined by their association with corepressors and coactivators, respectively. Among the coactivators, the steroid receptor coactivator (SRC) 2The abbreviations used are: SRC, steroid receptor coactivator; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; SUMO, small ubiquitin-like modifier; CREB, cAMP-response element-binding protein; E1, ubiquitin-activating enzyme; E2, ubiquitin carrier protein; E3, ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase; DBD, DNA-binding domain; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; HA, hemagglutinin; E2, 17β-estradiol; wt, wild type; aa, amino acid(s).2The abbreviations used are: SRC, steroid receptor coactivator; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; SUMO, small ubiquitin-like modifier; CREB, cAMP-response element-binding protein; E1, ubiquitin-activating enzyme; E2, ubiquitin carrier protein; E3, ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase; DBD, DNA-binding domain; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; HA, hemagglutinin; E2, 17β-estradiol; wt, wild type; aa, amino acid(s). family is both necessary and sufficient for nuclear receptor-mediated gene activation as we previously demonstrated (2Shang Y.

They share 40% overall sequence similarity, and they all contain, in the N terminus, a basic helix-loop-helix domain that is known for protein dimerization-DNA interaction as well as a Per-Arnt-Sim domain, which is known to be involved in protein-protein interaction. Three LXXLL motifs, also known as nuclear receptor boxes (for nuclear receptor binding), are centrally located in all three proteins (7Heery D.M. Kalkhoven E. Hoare S. Parker M.G. Nature. 1997; 387: 733-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (1768) Google Scholar, 8Darimont B.D. Wagner R.L. Apriletti J.W. Stallcup M.R. Kushner P.J. Baxter J.D. Fletterick R.J. Yamamoto K.R.

In the C terminus, the SRC proteins contain two activation domains, AD1 and AD2, which are associated with histone acetyltransferases (CREB-binding protein/p300 and pCAF) and coactivator-associated arginine methyltransferase 1, respectively, and function to modify the configuration of the chromatin structure (10Sheppard H.M.

Despite the structural similarities among the members of the SRC family of coactivators, evidence has been accumulated to suggest different physiological functions for SRC-1, GRIP1, and AIB1. Genetic studies with gene ablation showed that, although both male and female SRC1-null mice are viable and fertile, they exhibit partial resistance to several hormones, including estrogen, progestin, androgen, and thyroid hormones (12Xu J.

Chambon P. Mol. Cell.

It has been documented that, unlike SRC-1 and GRIP1, AIB1 is more promiscuous; it can enhance the transcriptional activity of a number of different activators (16Wu R.C. Qin J. Yi P. Wong J.

Indeed, AIB1-null mice are not only abnormal in reproductive function but also small in animal size (18Xu J. Liao L. Ning G. Yoshida-Komiya H. Deng C. O'Malley B.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

At the molecular level, we recently demonstrated SRC-1, GRIP1, and AIB1 are differentially implicated in steroid receptor-mediated gene transcription (20Zhang H. Yi X. Sun X. Yin N. Shi B. Wu H. Wang D. Wu G. Shang Y. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1753-1765Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 21Shang Y. Brown M. Science. 2002; 295: 2465-2468Crossref PubMed Scopus (990) Google Scholar, 22Wu H.

The differential activity for SRC-1, GRIP1, and AIB1 is probably determined primarily by their intrinsic protein structures. Ultimately, the function of a protein is also regulated by additional mechanisms particularly post-translational modifications. It has been reported that the activity of the SRC proteins is regulated by phosphorylation. For example, SRC-1 has been shown to be phosphorylated by mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) at Thr-1179 and Ser-1185. Mutations of these sites attenuated SRC-1 ability to coactivate progesterone receptor-dependent transcription (23Rowan B.G. Weigel N.L. O'Malley B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4475-4483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar); MAPK also phosphorylates GRIP1 but at Ser-736, the integrity of which is required for a full GRIP1 transcriptional activation function (24Lopez G.N. Turck C.W. Schaufele F. Stallcup M.R. Kushner P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22177-22182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Interestingly, these phosphorylation sites are not conserved in AIB1. AIB1 was shown to be phosphorylated by several different kinases, including MAPK, IκB kinase, and receptor tyrosine kinase HER2/neu (16Wu R.C. Qin J. Yi P. Wong J. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 937-949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 25Font de Mora J. Brown M. Mol. Cell.

Cancer Inst. 2004; 96: 926-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (985) Google Scholar), with Ser-505, Ser-543, Ser-860, and Ser-867 being identified as potential MAPK sites (16Wu R.C. Qin J. Yi P. Wong J. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 937-949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Sequence alignments for the SRC coactivators revealed that, whereas Ser-505 and Ser-543 of AIB1 are conserved in SRC-1 and GRIP1, Ser-860 and Ser-867 are unique for AIB1. Thus, different phosphorylation profiles may contribute, in part, to the differential activity of AIB1, GRIP1, and SRC-1. In addition to phosphorylation, recent studies have identified sumoylation as another important post-translational modification that regulates the biological functions of a protein. In sumoylation, SUMO (small ubiquitin-like modifier) is covalently attached to a lysine residue in a ψKXE sequence (where ψ is a large hydrophobic residue and X represents any amino acid) on the substrate protein, especially nuclear proteins, via a pathway similar to ubiquitination in which a battery of activating (E1), conjugating (E2), and ligating (E3) enzymes participate (27Gill G. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2046-2059Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar). Similar to phosphorylation, sumoylation is a reversible process, and desumoylation is the primary function of four SUMO-specific proteases: SENP1 is a nuclear protease that appears to deconjugate a large number of sumoylated proteins (28Nishida T. Tanaka H. Yasuda H. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6423-6427Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 29Cheng J. Wang D. Wang Z. Yeh E.T. Mol. Cell.

In this report, we demonstrated that SUMO-1 is conjugated to AIB1 protein, and in contrast to GRIP1 and SRC-1, SUMO modification attenuates, rather than enhances, the transactivation activity of AIB1. In addition, sumoylation of AIB1 coincided with a decreased level of AIB1 phosphorylation by MAPK, whereas AIB1 phosphorylation by MAPK was concomitant with a loss of the SUMO moiety. Therefore, phosphorylation and sumoylation appear to coordinately regulate the transcriptional activity of AIB1. Plasmids and Antibodies—AIB1 mutants (K723R, K786R, K1194R, K723R/K786R/K1194R, and S505A/S543A/S860A/S867A) were generated using site-directed mutagenesis according to the manufacturer's instructions (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Full-length AIB1 and the mutants were PCR-amplified and subcloned into pcDNA3.1-Gal4-DNA binding domain (DBD) to generate Gal4-DBD-AIB1 fusion constructs. pcDNA3-HA-SUMO-1 and pcDNA3-Ubc9-SV5 and dominant negative mutant DN-Ubc9 (C93S) were from Dr. Ronald Hay (University of St. Andrews, St. Andrews, UK). FLAG-SENP1, FLAG-SENP1 mutant (R630L/K631M), FLAG-SENP2, His-SENP3 were provided by Dr. Edward Yeh (The University of Texas, M.D. Anderson Cancer Center). Polyclonal anti-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 and anti-phosphor-ERK1/2, polyclonal antibodies against Gal4-DBD, mouse monoclonal anti-HA antibody, and anti-SUMO-1 were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG was from Sigma. Rabbit polyclonal anti-phosphoserine was from Zymed Laboratories (South San Francisco, CA). Cell Culture and Reporter Assays—MCF-7 human breast cancer cells and COS-7 African green monkey kidney cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Transient transfections were performed with Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) according to the company's specification. For luciferase assays, MCF-7 or COS-7 cells were seeded onto 24-well plates for 18 h and transfected with appropriate plasmid constructs. Five hours after transfection, cells were switched to phenol red-free medium containing 10% charcoal-dextran-treated fetal bovine serum for 48 h followed by treatment with or without 10 nm 17β-estradiol (E2) or 5 μm ICI-182,780 for 16 h. The cells then were harvested, and luciferase and Renilla activities were measured using a dual luciferase kit (Promega, Madison, WI). Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—MCF-7 or COS-7 cells were collected in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and cell extracts were prepared in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 0.5% sodium deoxycholate) with 1:100 diluted protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN). The cytosolic and nuclear protein extracts were prepared as previously described (43Tsai E. Jain J. Pesavento P. Rao A. Goldfeld A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 459-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). The cell extracts was pre-cleared using protein-A-Sepharose at 4 °C for 2 h. Following centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 10 min, the supernatant was incubated with appropriate antibodies for 16 h at 4 °C. Immune complexes were then captured using protein A-Sepharose. Following centrifugation at 6,000 × g for 10 min, the protein-A-Sepharose was washed four times in washing buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 500 or 800 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and 0.05% sodium deoxycholate). Bound proteins were released from the protein-A-Sepharose by boiling for 5 min in 2 × SDS loading buffer, resolved on 6–8% SDS-PAGE, and transferred onto Pure Nitrocellulose Blotting Membrane (Pall Corp.). The membrane was then probed using a secondary antibody and visualized using the enhanced chemiluminescence detection reagents (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. AIB1 Is Modified by SUMO-1—Sumoylation has recently been identified as an important mechanism that regulates protein functions in essential biological processes, such as gene transcription, subnuclear structure organization, and cell cycle progression. Within the SRC family of coactivators, both GRIP1 (41Kotaja N. Karvonen U. Janne O.A. Palvimo J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30283-30288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) and SRC-1 (38Chauchereau A. Amazit L. Quesne M. Guiochon-Mantel A. Milgrom E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12335-12343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) have been reported to be sumoylated. To understand the basis for diverse activities of AIB1 and the mechanism of the regulation of AIB1 activity, we wanted to know if AIB1 is also a sumoylated protein in vivo. For this purpose, we performed immunoprecipitation analysis of cellular extracts from breast cancer cells MCF-7 using anti-AIB1 antibodies, followed by immunoblotting with anti-SUMO-1. As shown in Fig. 1A, immunoprecipitated AIB1 could also be detected with an anti-SUMO-1 antibody, indicating that AIB1 is a sumoylated protein. Interestingly, AIB1 sumoylation quickly disappeared upon treatment of MCF-7 cells with 17β-estradiol (E2); 5 min after E2 treatment, sumoylated AIB1 was no longer detectable, although the total AIB1 level was unchanged (Fig. 1A, lower panel). Most SUMO conjugates are nuclear proteins, and it is likely that most of the major functions of SUMO take place in the nucleus. In addition, AIB1 functions as a cofactor that coactivates estrogen receptor-mediated transcription in the nucleus under the treatment of E2. In light of the observation that sumoylated AIB1 was only detected in the absence of E2 stimulation, we wished to know whether the sumoylation of AIB1 occurred in cytoplasm or in the nucleus. For this purpose, we prepared cytosolic and nuclear protein extracts separately from MCF-7 cells cultured in the absence of E2. Immunoprecipitation was performed with these two cellular protein fractions using the anti-AIB1 antibodies, and immunoprecipitates were then probed with the anti-SUMO-1 by Western blotting. As shown in Fig. 1B, sumoylated AIB1 was only detected in nuclear fraction of the cellular protein extracts, indicating that sumoylated AIB1 localizes in the nucleus. The efficiency for preparation of nuclear extracts and cytosolic extracts was monitored by measuring a nuclear protein marker, fibrillarin, and a cytosolic protein marker, β-actin (Fig. 1B). Identification of Sumoylation Sites in AIB1 Sequence—SUMO attachment to target proteins occurs at specific lysine residues, which are in most cases embedded in a consensus sequence ψKXE. In searching the amino acid stretch for the consensus SUMO modification motifs, we found three potential SUMO-1 attachment sites, lysines 723, 786, and 1194, in the AIB1 sequence. The lysines 723 and 786 locate in the first nuclear receptor interaction domain. The Lys-1194 locates in the Q-rich region downstream to the CREB-binding protein/p300 interaction domain. Interestingly, the Lys-723 and Lys-786 sites are conserved residues that are sumoylated in the two other members of the SRC family, SRC-1 (Lys-732 and Lys-774) and GRIP1 (Lys-731 and Lys-788) (38Chauchereau A. Amazit L. Quesne M. Guiochon-Mantel A. Milgrom E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12335-12343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 41Kotaja N. Karvonen U. Janne O.A. Palvimo J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30283-30288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). To examine whether these sites indeed serve as SUMO-1 acceptors in AIB1 as well as to test the effect of AIB1 sumoylation on its transactivation activity, we first generated AIB1 mutants in which these lysine residues were individually (K723R, K786R, or K1194R) or collectively (K723R/K786R/K1194R) changed to arginine residues. Wild-type (wt) and the mutated AIB1 were then fused to Gal4-DNA binding domain (Gal4-DBD). The Gal4-DBD AIB1 fusions were then expressed in COS-7 cells with or without cotransfection of a HA-tagged SUMO-1 plasmid. The cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with an anti-Gal4-DBD antibody followed by immunoprobing with an anti-HA antibody. As shown in Fig. 2A, HA tag could be detected in all three single lysine-mutated AIB1, K723R, K786R, or K1194R, whereas in AIB1 carrying K723R/K786R/K1194R, HA tag was no longer detected, suggesting that lysines 723, 786, and 1194 could all be the acceptors for SUMO conjugation in AIB1. The level of Gal4-DBD expression was similar in all experimental conditions (Fig. 2A, lower panel). To further define the sumoylation site(s) in AIB1, we next constructed the following Gal4-DBD-fused AIB1 fragments: N-terminal fragments (aa 1–740) containing Lys-723 or K723R, N-terminal fragments (aa 1–792) containing K723R and Lys-786 or K723R and K786R, and C-terminal fragments (aa 793–1424) containing Lys-1194 or K1194R (Fig. 2B). These constructs were transfected into COS-7 cells together with the HA-tagged SUMO-1 plasmid. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cellular extracts were immunoprecipitated with the antibody against Gal4-DBD, and the immunoprecipitates were immunoblotted using the antibody against HA. As shown in Fig. 2B, SUMO conjugation was detected in the N-terminal fragments containing Lys-723 or containing K723R and Lys-786 but not in the N-terminal fragments containing K723R or containing K723R and K786R. In the C-terminal fragments, SUMO conjugation was detected in the AIB1 fragment containing Lys-1194 but not that containing K1194R. In addition, corresponding C-terminal fragments of SRC-1 (aa 780–1441) or GRIP1 (aa 790–1462) did not show any SUMO conjugations. These experiments clearly showed that Lys-723, Lys-786, and Lys-1194 are all sumoylation sites in AIB1 and an additional sumoylation site exists in AIB1 compared with SRC-1 and GRIP1. Sumoylation of AIB1 Attenuates Its Transcriptional Activity—To examine the effect of AIB1 sumoylation on the transactivation activity of AIB1, we next transfected COS-7 cells with a Gal4 promoter-driven luciferase (Gal4-luc) construct together with the Gal4-DBD-AIB1 (wt or mutants), and the reporter activity was measured. As shown in Fig. 3, whereas AIB1 carrying K1194R had a similar effect as wt AIB1 on Gal4-luc activity, Gal4-luc activity was significantly increased in cells that were transfected with AIB1 carrying either K723R, K786R, or K723R/K786R/K1194R mutations (Fig. 3, upper panel). The maximal Gal4-luc activity was observed in cells that were transfected with AIB1 carrying K723R/K786R/K1194R mutations. In addition, the enhancement effect of these transfections on the Gal4-luc activity was dose-dependent. Similar results were obtained in COS-7 cells transfected with a luciferase expression construct driven by estrogen receptor-responsive element (Fig. 3, lower panel). These data suggest that the sumoylation of AIB1 attenuated its transactivation potential. Sumoylation is a reversible chemical modification, and deconjugation of SUMO is believed to be a function of one of four SUMO-specific proteases: SENP1, SENP2, SENP3, or SENP6. Of these, SENP1, SENP2, and SENP3 function in the nucleus, whereas SENP6 is a cytoplasmic enzyme. To further support the notion that sumoylation of AIB1 attenuated its transactivation activity and to investigate which de-sumoylating enzyme might be involved in regulating AIB1 activity, we next cotransfected de-sumoylating enzyme SENP1, SENP2, or SENP3 with Gal4-DBD-fused wt AIB1 and AIB1 mutant 3K/3R. As shown in Fig. 4, while cotransfection of SENP2 or SENP3 had minimal effects on Gal4-luc activity in COS-7 cells, cotransfection of SENP1 resulted in dramatic increases in the Gal4-luc activity in cells transfected with wt AIB1 (Fig. 4A). In AIB1 mutant 3K/3R-transfected cells, although the base level of the Gal4-luc was higher than that of wt AIB1-transfected cells, transfection of SENP1 did not increase the Gal4-luc activity. In addition, the effect of SENP1 on Gal4-luc in wt AIB1-transfected cells was dose-dependent (Fig. 4B). Moreover, cotransfection of an SENP1 mutant, which carries mutated residues (R630L/K631M) that are crucial to its catalytic activity, did not significantly alter Gal4-DBD-AIB1-mediated transcription. Collectively, these data indicated that SENP1 functions to de-sumoylate AIB1. The expression of the Gal4-DBD-fused wt AIB1 and SENP1 was confirmed by Western blotting (Fig. 4C). Moreover, cotransfection of a mutant of the E2 SUMO-conjugating enzyme Ubc9, Ubc9/C93S, which had a dominant negative effect on its wild type (29Cheng J. Wang D. Wang Z. Yeh E.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 6021-6028Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), enhanced Gal4-DNA-AIB1-mediated transcription (data not shown). All these data strongly supported the notion that sumoylation of AIB1 attenuates its transcriptional activity, and SENP1 is responsible for deconjugating the SUMO mark from AIB1 protein. AIB1 Modifications by Sumoylation and Phosphorylation—It has been documented that AIB1 is regulated by phosphorylation, and the transcriptional activity of AIB1 is enhanced by MAPK activation (16Wu R.C. Qin J. Yi P. Wong J. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 937-949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 25Font de Mora J. Brown M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5041-5047Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). MAPK can specifically phosphorylate AIB1 on Ser-505, Ser-543, Ser-860, and Ser-867 (16Wu R.C. Qin J. Yi P. Wong J. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 937-949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). To investigate the mechanism of sumoylation and phosphorylation in relation to AIB1 transcriptional activity, we first confirmed MAPK activation and AIB1 phosphorylation in our system. MCF-7 cells were treated with E2 for different periods of time, and cellular protein extracts were prepared for Western blotting analysis of p42/p44 MAPK activation and AIB1 phosphorylation. As shown in Fig. 5A, E2 treatment resulted in increased levels of phosphorylated ERK1/2 in MCF-7 cells; the effect was more evident after 15 min of E2 treatment. Reprobing the immunoblots with antibodies against ERK1/2 showed that the total level of ERK1/2 was not changed (Fig. 5A, lower panel). In the meantime, immunoprecipitation with anti-AIB1 antibodies followed by immunoblotting with an anti-phosphorserine antibody showed E2-induced phosphorylation of AIB1 (Fig. 5B). To examine the relationship between phosphorylation and sumoylation of AIB1, MCF-7 cells were treated with E2, a pure E2 antagonist ICI-182,780, or an ERK1/2-specific inhibitor U0126, and the cellular proteins were extracted and immunoprecipitated with AIB1 antibodies followed by Western blotting analysis of the immunoprecipitates with anti-SUMO-1 or anti-phosphor-serine. As shown in Fig. 5C, E2 treatment was associated with an increased AIB1 phosphorylation and decreased AIB1 sumoylation, whereas both ICI-182,780 and U0126 induced increased AIB1 sumoylation but decreased AIB1 phosphorylation, indicating that the sumoylation and phosphorylation of AIB1 may occur in a coordinated fashion. Coordinated Regulation of AIB1 Activity by Sumoylation and Phosphorylation—To explore a functional correlation between the coordinated sumoylation and phosphorylation of AIB1, we next examined the effects of SUMO and MAPK pathways on the transactivation potential of AIB1. The SUMO target-mutated AIB1 (K723R, K786R, K1194R, and K723R/K786R/K1194R) as well as phosphorylation target-mutated AIB1 (S505A/S543A/S860A/S867A) were used in experiments to analyze the effect of these AIB1 mutants on the coactivation of the Gal4-luc activity under various experimental conditions, including treatment with E2, ICI-182,780, or U0126 or cotransfection with SENP1 in COS-7 cells. As shown in Fig. 6, treatment with ICI-182,780 or U0126, which was associated with an increased sumoylation and a decreased phosphorylation of AIB1 as demonstrated above, resulted in decreased Gal4-luc activities. Meanwhile, treatment with E2 or cotransfection of SENP1 led to an increased Gal4-luc activity. The highest Gal4-luc activity was detected with AIB1 mutant carrying all sumoylation site mutations (K723R/K786R/K1194R), whereas the lowest Gal4-luc activity was detected with AIB1 mutant carrying all phosphorylation site mutations (S505A/S543A/S860A/S867A). All these data suggest a coordinated pattern of sumoylation and phosphorylation in regulating AIB1 transcriptional activity. To further support the coordinated pattern of sumoylation and phosphorylation of AIB1, MCF-7 cells were transfected with the Gal4-DBD-fused wt AIB1 or the AIB1 mutant carrying all sumoylation site mutations (K723R/K786R/K1194R) under no treatment or treatment with E2, and coimmunoprecipitation experiments were performed with the antibody against Gal4-DBD and then immunoblotted with anti-phosphor-serine. The results of the experiments indicated that phosphorylation was detected in sumoylation site-mutated AIB1 even under no treatment of E2 (Fig. 6D, left panel). Similar experiments were performed with Gal4-DBD-fused wt AIB1 or the AIB1 mutant carrying all phosphorylation site mutations (S505A/S543A/S860A/S867A). The results of these experiments revealed the retention of sumoylation in phosphorylation site-mutated AIB1 even after the treatment of E2 (Fig. 6D, right panel). These data strongly support a coordinated pattern between phosphorylation and sumoylation in regulating AIB1 activity. Moreover, these data may also help to explain the higher base levels of Gal4-luc activity in 3K/3R transfections and the overall lower activation of the Gal4-luc activity in 4S/4A transfections described in Figs. 4A, 6A, 6B, and 6C. AIB1 is highly expressed in the mammary gland, uterus, testis, pituitary gland, and muscle (44Suen C.S. Berrodin T.J. Mastroeni R. Cheskis B.J. Lyttle C.R. Frail D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27645-27653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) and is strongly amplified/overexpressed in 64% of primary breast cancers as well as in some of primary ovarian tumors (3Anzick S.L. Kononen J. Walker R.L. Azorsa D.O. Tanner M.M. Guan X.Y. Sauter G. Kallioniemi O.P. Trent J.M. Meltzer P.S. Science. 1997; 277: 965-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (1430) Google Scholar, 45Bautista S. Valles H. Walker R.L. Anzick S. Zeillinger R. Meltzer P. Theillet C. Clin. Cancer Res. 1998; 4: 2925-2929PubMed Google Scholar); thus, AIB1 has important physiological and pathological roles. At the molecular level, AIB1, together with the other two members of the SRC family of coactivators, GRIP1 and SRC-1, coactivates gene transcription mediated by nuclear receptors as well as by other unrelated transcription factors, such as NF-κB, AP-1, signal transducers and activators of transcriptions, ETS, p53, and E2F (46Wu R.C. Smith C.L. O'Malley B.W. Endocr. Rev. 2005; 26: 393-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 47Yin N. Wang D. Zhang H. Yi X. Sun X. Shi B. Wu H. Wu G. Wang X. Shang Y. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 5870-5875Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Although closely related, AIB1, GRIP1, and SRC-1 exhibit differential functions that are manifested in animal phenotypes as well as in transcriptional outputs. Recently, we demonstrated that SRC coactivator proteins function in heterodimers in which AIB1 is the common dimerization partner for GRIP1 and SRC-1 (20Zhang H. Yi X. Sun X. Yin N. Shi B. Wu H. Wang D. Wu G. Shang Y. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1753-1765Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The basic mechanisms underlying ligand-dependent transcription initiation by nuclear receptors indicate a sequential recruitment of an assortment of coactivators. Increasing numbers of coactivators have been identified in recent years, and both biochemical and genetic studies have demonstrated that these coactivators are differentially used by transcription factors, including nuclear receptors, in a cell/tissue type- and promoter-specific manner. However, the molecular basis underlying this specificity remains largely unknown. In the past years, both nuclear receptors and cofactors have been shown to be targeted for post-translational modifications by diverse cellular signaling pathways. It is proposed that post-translational modifications of these cofactor proteins provide the basis for a combinatorial code required for specific gene activation by nuclear receptors and coactivators and that this code also enables coactivators to efficiently stimulate the activity of other classes of transcription factors (46Wu R.C. Smith C.L. O'Malley B.W. Endocr. Rev. 2005; 26: 393-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation is a fundamental mechanism of post-translational modifications implicated in signal transduction. Phosphorylation of AIB1 has been shown to involve different kinases, such as MAPK, IκB kinase, and receptor tyrosine kinase HER2/neu (16Wu R.C. Qin J. Yi P. Wong J. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W.

Biol. 2002; 22: 3549-3561Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). It has been shown that different signals differentially phosphorylate AIB1 at different combinations of sites and that these phosphorylated profiles of AIB1 encode for distinct physiological functions (16Wu R.C. Qin J. Yi P. Wong J. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 937-949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). In addition, studies in recent years have identified another important post-translational modification, sumoylation. SUMO has been shown to covalently modify a large number of proteins with important roles in many cellular processes, including gene expression, chromatin structure, signal transduction, and maintenance of the genome. Relevant to this report, two members of the SRC family of coactivators, GRIP1 and SRC-1, have been shown to be modified by SUMO (38Chauchereau A. Amazit L. Quesne M. Guiochon-Mantel A. Milgrom E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12335-12343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 41Kotaja N. Karvonen U. Janne O.A. Palvimo J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30283-30288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). In addition, sumoylated GRIP1 and SRC-1 are associated with their enhanced transactivation activity. In this report, we showed that the AIB1 is also a sumoylated protein. But surprisingly, sumoylation attenuated AIB1 transactivation activity. Currently, there are no clear molecular explanations for the mechanism by which SUMO addition regulates transcription factor activity. Clearly, modification with SUMO alters the surface of the target protein and might cause either general conformational changes or specific changes at critical interfaces, thereby influencing the ability of the protein to interact with its partners. One possibility is that sumoylation promotes or inhibits protein-protein interactions and thereby regulates the assembly of transcriptional complexes. Alternatively, sumoylation might block other lysine-targeted modifications such as acetylation, methylation, or ubiquitination. Other possibilities include subnuclear redistribution of sumoylated transcription regulators. Sumoylation of transcription regulators could serve to organize specific protein complexes into nuclear matrix sites within nuclear bodies, thus regulating their activities either negatively or positively. In any event, how sumoylation affects the transcription activity of its target protein remains an intriguing question for further investigation. Our observation that sumoylation renders AIB1 functionally opposite to its close cousins GRIP1 and SRC-1 is even more intriguing; after all, these proteins are so much alike. We reported a sumoylation site in AIB1 (Lys-1194) outside of the nuclear receptor box, which has not been reported for GRIP1 and SRC-1. Interestingly, AIB1 was also shown to harbor unique MAPK phosphorylation sites that are not conserved in SRC-1 and GRIP1; among MAPK-targeted Ser-505, Ser-543, Ser-860, and Ser-867 of AIB1, Ser-505 and Ser-543 are conserved in SRC-1 and GRIP1, and Ser-860 and Ser-867 are unique for AIB1 (16Wu R.C.

Whether or not these unique modifications in AIB1 contribute in anyway to specific AIB1 activities will be a subject of future investigations. Nevertheless, it is clear that functional specificity of a protein is partly determined by the specificity of the regulation/modification of the protein, and, as mentioned above, AIB1, GRIP1, and SRC-1 exhibit differential activities that may be consequences of differential post-translational modifications. Dynamic interplays by different post-translational modifications are important for functional dynamics of proteins. The antagonistic relationship between phosphorylation and sumoylation has also been reported for transcription factor EIk-1 (49Yang S.H. Jaffray E. Hay R.T. Sharrocks A.D. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 63-74Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Our results indicated that a dynamic phosphorylation and sumoylation may play important roles in regulating AIB1 activity. The overall transactivation potential of AIB1 could be enhanced by activation of the MAPK pathway accompanying a loss of SUMO mark in AIB1. On the other hand, the transcription activation potential of AIB1 is dampened upon its sumoylation, which is concomitant with its dephosphorylation. Thus, it is logical to assume that a balance between phosphorylation and sumoylation is critical in the final readout of the AIB1 activity. In addition, it is not clear how E2 treatment leads to desumoylation of AIB1. Clearly, the fast effect of E2 treatment on the sumoylation status of AIB1 suggests a non-genomic action for estrogen. It is conceivable that, similar to the activation of MAPK pathway, estrogen treatment emanates stimuli that activate signaling pathways responsible for SUMO de-conjugation. Future studies will focus on the delineation of the molecular details that influence the switch between phosphorylation and sumoylation."

However, it is still unclear how complex I couples electron transfer from NADH to ubiquinone with the vectorial translocation of four protons across the bioenergetic membrane (4Wikström M.K.F.

The Fe4S4 cluster N2 is the last component in a “wire” of seven iron-sulfur clusters connecting FMN, the immediate oxidant for NADH, and substrate ubiquinone (3Sazanov L.A. Hinchliffe P.

While all other clusters in this chain have a redox midpoint potential of around −250 mV, iron-sulfur cluster N2 has a significantly more positive Em7 of typically −150 mV (12Ingledew W.J. Ohnishi T.

FEBS Lett. 1972; 23: 3-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) and the comparably more positive potential, cluster N2 has been implicated as a key component of the proton pump (6Brandt U.

Science. 2006; 311: 1430-1436Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). Like the proximal iron-sulfur cluster of hydrogenase, iron-sulfur cluster N2 is at the interface between two subunits, the PSST subunit and the 49-kDa subunit (Fig. 1). In water-soluble [NiFe] hydrogenases a conserved histidine of the large subunit forms a hydrogen bond to the iron-sulfur cluster ligated to the small subunit (19Volbeda A. Charon M.H. Piras C. Hatchikian E.C. Frey M. Fontecilla-Camps J.C. Nature. 1995; 373: 580-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (1362) Google Scholar). Remarkably, a fully conserved histidine is also found at the corresponding position in the 49-kDa subunit of complex I. Mutating this histidine (His226)to methionine in the 49-kDa subunit of complex I from the strictly aerobic yeast Yarrowia lipolytica shifts the EPR spectrum of reduced iron sulfur cluster N2 to slightly lower field values but does not significantly affect the catalytic activity of complex I (20Grgic L.

Isolation of Intact Mitochondria—Intact mitochondria from Y. lipolytica were prepared essentially by the enzymatic digestion method described in Ref. 23Zvyagilskaya R. Parchomenko O. Abramova N.

Y. lipolytica cells were harvested at early logarithmic stage (OD ∼3-4), washed twice in ice-cold water, resuspended (0.1 g wet cells/ml) at room temperature in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.6) supplemented with 5 mm dithiothreitol and incubated for 10 min, diluted with water, and washed twice again. After the last centrifugation the weakened cells were resuspended (0.1 g wet cells/ml) in 1.2 m sorbitol and 10 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.5) and 3-4 mg/ml zymolyase 20T (from Arthrobacter luteus, ICN Biomedicals) was added to digest the cell wall. The formation of spheroplasts was monitored spectrophotometrically, and usually 10-15 min of incubation at 30 °C was enough to complete the digestion. After that, 0.2 mm Pefablock SC was added, the spheroplast suspension was rapidly cooled and centrifuged at 500-600 × g for 10 min, and the pellet was resuspended and washed twice in the same buffer containing 4 mg/ml fatty acid-free BSA. 3The abbreviations used are: BSA, bovine serum albumin; Mes, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; Mops, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid. The pellet of the last centrifugation was resuspended in grinding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.3), 0.4 m mannitol, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 4 mg/ml BSA, fatty acid-free). Spheroplasts were disrupted by 20 gentle strokes in a loosely fitting Dounce homogenizer. The suspension was diluted twice with isolation buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.3), 0.6 m mannitol, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 4 mg/ml BSA) and centrifuged at 2000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was collected and centrifuged once more at 7000 × g for 20 min, and the pellet was resuspended with a smaller volume of isolation buffer and centrifuged again. The mitochondria were resuspended in 500-700 μl of isolation buffer and used immediately. Redox Titration of Iron-Sulfur Cluster N2—Redox titrations of mitochondrial membranes from parental strain and mutant H226M were performed under anaerobic conditions in the presence of redox mediators essentially as described previously (13Garofano A. Zwicker K. Kerscher S. Okun P. Brandt U. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 42435-42440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Membranes were diluted in buffer containing sodium acetate, Mes, Mops, Tris, glycine each at 30 mm, 100 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA. The solution was adjusted to the desired pH value at a protein concentration of 25-30 mg/ml. The following redox mediator dyes were added at final concentrations of 50 μm, N,N,N′,N′-tetramethylphenylene diamine, phenazine methosulfate, methylene blue, menadione, resorufin, indigo-trisulfonate, 1,2-naphthoquinone, 2-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone, phenosafranine, benzyl viologen, and methyl viologen. The membrane suspension was poised at appropriate potential values by addition of small amounts of 50 mm dithionite solution. Aliquots were anaerobically transferred into EPR tubes, shock frozen in cold isopentane/methyl cyclohexane (5:1) and stored in liquid nitrogen until measurement. The degree of cluster N2 reduction was monitored by EPR spectroscopy at 12 K. N2 signal intensities were determined after baseline correction and subtraction of high potential components (subtraction of an EPR spectrum obtained at higher redox potential without any detectable N2 signal). Fitting N2 signal intensities to the standard Nernst equation resulted in the given Em values. To check reversibility, after some titrations the membrane suspension was incubated in the presence of oxygen, and the slow autoxidation process was followed by taking several EPR samples. The cluster N2 EPR intensities of these samples at a given potential closely matched those obtained during reductive titration of the solution. Determination of Proton-pumping Stoichiometries—Proton pumping of different segments of the respiratory chain in intact mitochondria from Y. lipolytica was measured at 30 °C as intramitochondrial alkalization using the pH indicator neutral red (80 μm, 529-475 nm). The buffer was as follows: 0.6 m mannitol, 0.5 mm EDTA, 4 mg/ml BSA, 60 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6). Consecutively, appropriate substrates, 40 mm KCl, 1 μm valinomycin, and 2 mm cyanide were added, and oxidant pulses were applied by the addition of small amounts of electron acceptors to initiate redox-dependent proton translocation from the matrix. Matrix NADH was generated through reduction by malate dehydrogenase and the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex by adding malate/pyruvate to the mitochondria. The Midpoint Potential of Iron-Sulfur Cluster N2 Is pH-dependent—Similar to complex I from other sources (24Sled V.D. Friedrich T. Leif H. Weiss H. Fukumori Y. Calhoun M.W. Gennis R.B. Ohnishi T. Meinhardt S.W. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1993; 25: 347-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) the N2 midpoint potential of Y. lipolytica complex I at pH 7 is −140 mV (Fig. 2; Ref. 13Garofano A. Zwicker K. Kerscher S. Okun P. Brandt U. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 42435-42440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). To determine the redox-Bohr effect of iron-sulfur cluster N2 in Y. lipolytica mitochondrial membranes we measured its midpoint potential in the range between pH 5 and 9 (Fig. 2B). Due to some instability of the cluster at extreme pH values, it was difficult to reliably quantify the degree of reduction in particular at more positive redox potentials. Therefore, the Em values determined at pH 5 and 9 were not used for calculating the pH profile of iron-sulfur cluster N2. The pH dependence of the midpoint potential of iron-sulfur cluster N2 could be described by assuming a single protonated group. The fitted curve had a maximal slope of −36 mV/pH, and pK values of 5.7 for the oxidized state and 7.3 for the reduced state were calculated (Fig. 2B). These pK values fit well to a histidine side chain as the protonated group involved. His226 Is the Redox-Bohr Group Associated with Iron-Sulfur Cluster N2—We have shown previously that the mutation of histidine 226 in the 49-kDa subunit to methionine has little effect on steady-state activity and inhibitor sensitivity of complex I (20Grgic L. Zwicker K. Kashani-Poor N. Kerscher S. Brandt U. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21193-21199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). However, when we determined the redox midpoint potential of complex I from mutant H226M at pH 7, we found that it was shifted to the negative from −140 mV to −220 mV (Fig. 2A). More importantly, the Em value did not change significantly from pH 6 to 8, indicating that the mutation had completely abolished the pH dependence of this redox group (Fig. 2B). This indicated that the redox-Bohr group associated with iron-sulfur cluster N2 of complex I is the conserved histidine at position 226 of the 49-kDa subunit. It should be noted that complex I from the mutant was somewhat more sensitive to extreme pH values limiting the range where the redox-midpoint potential could be determined. His226 Is Not Part of the Proton Pump—If the redox-Bohr effect of cluster N2 was part of the proton-translocating machinery of complex I, abolishing the pH dependence of the midpoint potential should impair proton pumping. Therefore, we determined the H+/e− stoichiometry for complex I in intact mitochondria from the parental strain and from mutant H226M using the oxidant pulse technique (25Mitchell P. Moyle J. Mitchell R.M. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 55: 627-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar): pulses of oxidant were added to coupled mitochondria in the presence of excess reductant. Proton extrusion was monitored using the pH indicator neutral red. By choosing appropriate reductants and oxidants, the proton pumping activity of individual complexes or a larger segment of the respiratory chain could be monitored (Fig. 3). The response was calibrated internally (4Wikström M.K.F. FEBS Lett. 1984; 169: 300-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) by measuring proton pumping of respiratory complex III (cytochrome bc1 complex) that has a well established pumping stoichiometry of 1 H+/e−. When we probed the segment comprising complexes I and III in the parental strain by malate/pyruvate and ferricyanide, proton pumping per added oxidation equivalent was about three times higher than for complex III alone that was probed separately using ubiquinol and ferrycyanide (Fig. 3A). With five different batches of mitochondria an overall stoichiometry of 2.8 ± 0.1 H+/e− for complexes I + III was determined. When complex I alone was probed with malate/pyruvate and ubiquinone the measured stoichiometry was 1.7 ± 0.1 H+/e− (n = 3). This indicated that, like its counterpart from bovine heart (5Galkin A.S. Grivennikova V.G. Vinogradov A.D. FEBS Lett. 1999; 451: 157-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), complex I from Y. lipolytica pumped four H+ per NADH oxidized (2 e−) across the inner mitochondrial membrane. With mutant H226M we determined stoichiometries of 2.8 ± 0.1 H+/e− (n = 5) for complexes I + III and 1.9 ± 0.1 H+/e− (n = 2) for complex I alone (Fig. 3B). Moreover, mitochondria from parental and mutant strain exhibited almost identical respiration rates and synthesized the same amount of ATP per oxygen consumed. This also indicated that proton pumping was not at all affected by the mutation. Our data indicate that residue His226 of the 49-kDa subunit of Y. lipolytica complex I is the protonated group that is responsible for the pH dependence of the redox midpoint potential of iron-sulfur cluster N2. This is consistent with the fact that in the structure of the peripheral arm of T. thermophilus complex I the corresponding histidine is found within 4 Å of iron-sulfur cluster N2 (3Sazanov L.A. Hinchliffe P. Science. 2006; 311: 1430-1436Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). In earlier studies, we had changed this histidine to alanine, glutamine, or cysteine. These mutations also had only moderate effects on the catalytic activity of complex I, but the EPR signal of iron-sulfur cluster N2 was markedly reduced (16Kashani-Poor N. Zwicker K. Kerscher S. Brandt U. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24082-24087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 20Grgic L. Zwicker K. Kashani-Poor N. Kerscher S. Brandt U. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21193-21199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). It is quite remarkable that removing the redox-Bohr group of iron-sulfur cluster N2 and thereby abolishing the pH dependence of its redox midpoint potential and shifting Em7 by −80 mV had no effect on the proton pumping capacity of complex I. Because such dramatic changes in the physicochemical properties of iron-sulfur cluster N2 had no functional consequences, one can effectively rule out any specific role for this redox center within the energy converting mechanism of complex I other than serving as the electron donor for ubiquinone. In mutant H226M, electrons that are fed into complex I from NADH stay on a very negative potential until they reach ubiquinone. The unexpected observation that this does not affect proton pumping by complex I strongly suggests that the energy conversion driving proton translocation across the membrane is immediately linked to the redox chemistry of ubiquinone but is not associated to one of the electron transfers upstream. As implicated in several proposed mechanisms for complex I (6Brandt U. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1318: 79-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 7Ohnishi T. Salerno J.C. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 4555-4561Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 26Brandt U. Biofactors. 1999; 9: 95-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), redox-linked protonations and deprotonations of ubiquinone intermediates could be directly employed to drive vectorial proton translocation. In more recent models combinations of direct and conformational coupling mechanisms have been suggested to account for the observed pumping stoichimetry of complex I (7Ohnishi T. Salerno J.C. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 4555-4561Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 8Friedrich T. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2001; 33: 169-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). In fact, biochemical (28Belogrudov G. Hatefi Y. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4571-4576Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) and structural evidence (29Mamedova A.A. Holt P.J. Carroll J. Sazanov L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 23830-23836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) for redox-linked conformational changes of complex I has been presented. However, the spatial separation of all redox centers from the membrane domain (3Sazanov L.A. Hinchliffe P. Science. 2006; 311: 1430-1436Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar) seems to exclude any direct link between redox chemistry and vectorial proton translocation as defined by Peter Mitchell's “redox-loop” concept (30Mitchell P. Biol. Rev. 1966; 41: 445-502Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Instead, coupling exclusively by long range conformational changes seems likely. Therefore, we propose that, although the redox transitions of ubiquinone do generate the driving force for proton pumping, protonation of the substrate upon reduction is a purely scalar reaction. Thus, the protons involved in quinone chemistry are not those that are translocated across the membrane. Rather we suggest that stepwise reduction of ubiquinone at the interface between the 49-kDa and PSST subunit triggers conformational changes that are transmitted to subunits of the membrane arm acting as the actual proton-pumping devices. The most likely candidates for this task are the mitochondrially encoded subunits ND2, ND4, and ND5 because they exhibit homology to bacterial Na+/H+ antiporters (27Mathiesen C. Hägerhäll C.

Gene structure, amino acid sequence, and the modular structure of FVII reveal that the protein is organized into several discrete domains (3Hagen F.S. Gray C.L. O'Hara P. Grant F.J. Saari G.C.

FVII consists of an N-terminal γ-carboxyglutamic acid domain (Gla), a short hydrophobic segment, two epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domains, and a C-terminal serine protease module, which consists of two β-barrel subdomains (3Hagen F.S.

In each case, the activation of FVII involves the cleavage of a single peptide bond between Arg152 and Ile153, located in the connecting region between the EGF2 and the protease domains. This results in the formation of a two-chain FVIIa molecule that consists of a 152-residue light chain and a 254-residue heavy chain held together by a single disulfide bridge. Characteristic of trypsin-like serine proteases (10Huber R. Bode W. Acc. Chem. Res. 1978; 11: 114-122Crossref Google Scholar), the heavy chain of FVIIa contains the catalytic triad, namely His57, Asp102, and Ser195, with Asp189 (chymotrypsin numbering) at the bottom of the S1 specificity pocket (3Hagen F.S.

Tissue factor (TF) (CD142) is a transmembrane protein belonging to the class 2 cytokine receptor family (11Bazan J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6934-6938Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Human TF consists of the following three regions: an N-terminal extracellular region of 219 residues, a transmembrane region of 23 residues, and a C-terminal cystoplasmic region of 19 residues. The extracellular region of TF consists of two fibronectin type III repeats. The crystal structure of the extracellular domain pair termed soluble TF (sTF, residues 1-219) is known (12Harlos K.

Similar to full-length TF, sTF binds FVIIa with high affinity and potentiates its enzymatic activity (16Ruf W. Rehemtulla A. Morrissey J.H. Edgington T.S. J. Biol.

Recent evidence indicates that the TF pathway (or the extrinsic pathway) plays a primary role in initiating blood coagulation during normal hemostasis as well as during many pathologic situations, including arteriosclerosis and septicemia (5Davie E.W. Fujikawa K. Kisiel W. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10363-10370Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This pathway begins by exposure of blood to TF in the extravascular space at an injury site and formation of the complex between TF and plasma factor FVII/VIIa. The FVIIa/TF complex then activates FIX, FX, and FVII. The FXa thus formed with FVa, Ca2+, and phospholipid (PL) then activates prothrombin to thrombin, which cleaves fibrinogen to fibrin, which polymerizes to form a clot (5Davie E.W. Fujikawa K. Kisiel W. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10363-10370Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Banner et al. (19Banner D.W. D'Arcy A. Chene C. Winkler F.K. Guha A. Koningberg W.H. Nemerson Y. Kirchhofer D.

The crystals were grown in the presence of Ca2+ using chloromethyl ketone-inhibited active site FVIIa and two fragments of sTF obtained by subtilisin treatment. The structure revealed that part of the helix composed of residues 30-40 of the Gla domain makes van der Waals contacts with sTF, and the EGF1 domain makes extensive contacts with sTF. The EGF2 and the protease domain also make contacts with sTF, which appears to be a complex interface region. Consistent with biochemical data (20Sabharwal A.K. Birktoft J.J. Gorka J. Wildgoose P.

Recently, it has been reported that Mg2+ plays an important role in physiologic coagulation (23Sekiya F. Yoshida M. Yamashita T. Morita T. J. Biol.

Furthermore, it has been proposed that FVIIa contains a Na+ site (27Dang Q.D. Di Cera E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Notably, FVIIa also contains two Zn2+ sites in its protease domain (34Petersen L.C. Olsen O.H. Nielsen L.S. Freskgard P.O. Persson E. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 859-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Occupancy of the Zn2+ sites inhibits FVIIa catalytic activity in the absence but poorly in the presence of Ca2+. This observation led to the hypothesis that Zn2+ binds to the protease domain Ca2+ loop and attenuates the activity of FVIIa (34Petersen L.C. Olsen O.H. Nielsen L.S. Freskgard P.O. Persson E. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 859-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 35Pedersen A.H. Lund-Hansen T. Komiyama Y. Petersen L.C. Oestergard P.B. Kisiel W. Thromb.

Here we report a 1.8 Å crystal structure of p-aminobenzamidine-FVIIa/sTF (pAB-VIIa/sTF), solved from crystals grown in the presence of Ca2+,Mg2+,Na+, and Zn2+. The Gla domain has four Ca2+ and three Mg2+ sites, and the protease domain has two Zn2+ sites unique to FVIIa. The Na+ site is structurally similar to the Na+ site in FXa (36Padmanabhan K.

Moreover, the main chain NH of 193 (chymotrypsin numbering) in FVIIa points away from the oxyanion hole in the pAB-VIIa/sTF and benzamidine-VIIa/sTF structures. This is an uncharacteristic feature of serine proteases (10Huber R. Bode W. Acc. Chem. Res. 1978; 11: 114-122Crossref Google Scholar), and inclusion of pAB (42Hopfner K.P. Lang A. Karcher A.

Interestingly, soaking benzamidine-VIIa/sTF crystals with d-Phe-Pro-Arg-chloromethyl ketone (d-FPR-ck) resulted in benzamidine displacement, d-FPR incorporation, and induction of the oxyanion hole. From these data, we infer that TF binding restructures the activation domains in FVIIa (47Higashi S. Matsumoto N. Iwanaga S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26569-26574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), but it does not induce formation of the oxyanion hole. Instead, it is the binding of the substrate/inhibitor at the active site that induces oxyanion hole formation required for catalysis. The importance of this mechanism in attaining unique selectivity of the molecular substrates to initiate physiologic coagulation by FVIIa/TF is discussed. Reagents—Magnesium chloride, calcium chloride, and PEG 4000 were purchased from Hampton Research. 45CaCl2 was obtained from ICN Biochemicals. Phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylserine, Trizma (Tris base), choline chloride (ChCl), zinc chloride, benzamidine, p-aminobenzamidine (pAB), and all other chemicals of the highest grade available were obtained from Sigma. d-FPR-ck was obtained from Calbiochem. Proteins—Human FVII was expressed using pMon3360b expression vector in BHK/VP16 cells as described by Hippenmeyer and Highkin (48Hippenmeyer P. Highkin M. Bio/Technology. 1993; 11: 1037-1041PubMed Google Scholar) and Zhong et al. (49Zhong D. Bajaj M.S. Schmidt A.E. Bajaj S.P. J. Biol.

The FVII was purified using a Ca2+-dependent monoclonal antibody and FPLC Mono Q column chromatography (49Zhong D. Bajaj M.S. Schmidt A.E. Bajaj S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3622-3631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Gla analysis was performed by Commonwealth Biotechnologies, Inc. (Richmond, VA), using alkaline hydrolysis followed by high pressure liquid chromatography analysis. The amount of Gla was quantitated based upon Asp and Asn present per mol of FVII. Purified FVII contained nine Gla residues per mol. FVIIa was obtained using FXa-Sepharose as described previously, and the resin was removed by gentle centrifugation (2Bajaj S.P. Rapaport S.I.

The purified protein was concentrated to ∼20 mg/ml and stored at -80 °C until used. sTF (residues 1-219) was obtained from E. G. Tuddenham (Imperial College, London) and from Tom Girard Monsanto/Pharmacia. sTF was concentrated to ∼10 mg/ml and stored at -80 °C. Both proteins were ∼98% pure as judged by SDS-gel electrophoresis (50Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (200565) Google Scholar). Human FX was purchased from ERL (South Bend, IN). Recombinant human TF containing the transmembrane domain (residues 1-243) was a gift from Genentech (San Francisco, CA). Preparation of Relipidated (r)TF—Phospholipid (PL) vesicles (75% phosphatidylcholine, 25% phosphatidylserine) were prepared by a slight modification of the method of Husten et al.(51Husten E.J. Esmon C.T. Johnson A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12953-12961Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Human TF was diluted to 30 μg/ml in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl (TBS), pH 7.5, containing 10 mm CHAPS and mixed with an equal volume of 2 mm PL vesicles. The mixture was incubated for 2 h at 37 °C. The rTF was extensively dialyzed at 4 °C against TBS, pH 7.5, to remove CHAPS. The functional TF concentration was determined as described previously (52Warn-Cramer B.J. Bajaj S.P. Biochem. J. 1986; 239: 757-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) using FX as a substrate. Approximately 60% of TF (calculated from the starting concentration) was available on the outside of the vesicles assuming a stoichiometry of 1:1 between FVIIa and TF. Crystallization—The pAB-VIIa/sTF or the benzamidine-VIIa/sTF complex was crystallized using the sitting drop or the hanging drop vapor diffusion method. Specifically, the protein drop contained 4 mg/ml VIIa/sTF complex, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 10 mm CaCl2 ± 20 μm ZnCl2, and 10 mm pAB or 10 mm benzamidine, whereas the reservoir solution contained 16-22% PEG 4000, 100 mm MgCl2, and 20 mm BisTris, pH 6.5. Drops were prepared by mixing 2 μl of protein solution with 2 μl of reservoir solution at 20 °C. Crystals appeared within 7 days and were allowed to grow up to 14-20 days before being flash-frozen without additional cryoprotectant. For soaking experiments, 50 μl of 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 20 μm ZnCl2, and 10 mm CaCl2 was mixed with 50 μl of the reservoir solution (22% PEG 4000, 100 mm MgCl2, pH 6.5). The above mixture was allowed to equilibrate with 1 ml of the reservoir solution for 1 week. Five-μl volume of d-FPR-ck was added to the drop to achieve a final concentration of 250 μm inhibitor. Two benzamidine-VIIa/sTF crystals grown in the presence of 20 μm ZnCl2 were then soaked in the drop for 48 h. During soaking, the drop was allowed to equilibrate with the reservoir solution. The crystals were flash-frozen without additional cryoprotectant. X-ray Data Collection—The pAB-VIIa/sTF data set was collected at beamline X12C of the National Synchrotron Light Source in Upton, NY, using a Brandeis 4 CCD detector. One crystal containing 20 μm ZnCl2 diffracted to a resolution of 1.8 Å, the details of which are presented here. Three different data sets were collected for the benzamidine-VIIa/sTF crystals. One crystal had 20 μm Zn2+, and the other two did not contain any added Zn2+. One of the crystals without added Zn2+ diffracted to 1.87 Å, which is presented here. This data set was collected at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility beam 14-2 at 0.93 λ. The other two benzamidine crystals, one with additional ZnCl2 and one without additional ZnCl2, each diffracted to 2.2 Å, and the crystal (which contained ZnCl2) soaked with d-FPR (subsequently referred to as d-FPR-VIIa/sTF) diffracted to 2.0 Å. These three data sets were collected at beamline X12C of the National Synchrotron Light Source. All crystals belonged to the orthorhombic space group P212121 with one molecule of the pAB-VIIa/sTF or benzamidine-VIIa/sTF or d-FPR-VIIa/sTF complex in the asymmetric unit. The data were processed and scaled using the programs DENZO and SCALEPACK (53Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (36025) Google Scholar). Structure Determination and Refinement—First, the structure of pAB-VIIa/sTF was determined. Initial phases were calculated using the structure of Banner et al. (19Banner D.W. D'Arcy A. Chene C. Winkler F.K. Guha A. Koningberg W.H. Nemerson Y. Kirchhofer D. Nature. 1996; 380: 41-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar) (PDB code 1DAN), as a starting model. This was followed by several rounds of positional, B-factor, and simulated annealing protocols using the program XPLOR (54Brünger A.T. A System for X-ray Crystallography and NMR, X-PLOR, Version 3.1. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1992Google Scholar). Ten percent of the data was kept out of refinement for cross-validation (55Kleywegt G.J. Brunger A.T. Structure (Lond.). 1996; 4: 897-904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). During initial refinement stages, it became obvious that the Gla domain is tilted ∼6° toward the TF2 domain, and that the ω loop has a slightly different conformation in comparison to the Ca2+ only structure (19Banner D.W.

The EGF1 domain Ca2+ is numbered 8, and the protease domain Ca2+ is numbered 9. and Ca2+ ions were placed at the 2-, 3-, 5-, and 6-positions based upon previous structures of Gla domains (19Banner D.W.

The positions of these metals were refined and subsequently solvent molecules surrounding these metals as well as other metal ions (EGF1 and protease domain Ca2+, Na+, and Zn2+) were added to the model.

https://openalex.org/W2001695617,"G-protein-coupled receptors play a key role in signal transduction processes. Despite G-protein-coupled receptors being transmembrane proteins, the notion that they exhibit voltage sensitivity is rather novel. Here we examine whether two metabotropic glutamate receptors, mGluR3 and mGluR1a, both involved in fundamental physiological processes, exhibit, by themselves, voltage sensitivity. Measuring mGluR3-induced K+ currents and mGluR1a-induced Ca2+-activated Cl– currents in Xenopus oocytes, we show that the apparent affinity toward glutamate decreases (mGluR3) or increases (mGluR1a) upon depolarization. Measurements of binding of [3H]glutamate to oocytes expressing either mGluR3 or mGluR1a corroborated the electrophysiological results. Using the chimeric Gα subunit, we further show that the voltage sensitivity does not reside in the G-protein. To locate sites within the receptors that are involved in the voltage sensitivity, we used chimeric mGluR1a, where the intracellular loops that couple to the G-protein were replaced by those of mGluR3. The voltage sensitivity of the chimeric mGluR1a resembled that of mGluR3 and not that of the parental mGluR1a. The cumulative results indicate that the voltage sensitivity does not reside downstream to the activation of the receptors but rather in the mGluR3 and mGluR1a themselves. Furthermore, the intracellular loops play a crucial role in relaying changes in membrane potential to changes in the affinity of the receptors toward glutamate.

Pin J.P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1723-1729Crossref PubMed Scopus (1215) Google Scholar) and are involved in most signal transduction processes. GPCRs are activated by binding specific agonists, but, being transmembrane proteins, their activity could potentially be modulated also by membrane potential, and this in turn would enlarge the scope of their activity. Indeed, membrane potential was reported to regulate various processes that are mediated by a variety of different subtypes of GPCRs. For example, Ca2+ release from intracellular stores induced by a muscarinic receptor (2Ganitkevich V. Isenberg G. J. Physiol. 1993; 470: 35-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), a purinergic receptor P2Y (3Martinez-Pinna J. Gurung I.S. Vial C. Leon C. Gachet C. Evans R.J. Mahaut-Smith M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 1490-1498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), or by an adrenergic receptor (4Itoh T. Seki N. Suzuki S. Ito S. Kajikuri J. Kuriyama H. J. Physiol. 1992; 451: 307-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) were all reported to be voltage-dependent. Also, it was reported that the inhibition of P/Q-type Ca2+ channels by the metabotropic glutamate receptor of subtype 7 is affected by membrane potential (5Perroy J. Richard S. Nargeot J. Bockaert J. Fagni L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1223-1228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In all studies mentioned above, as well as in other studies demonstrating a regulatory effect of membrane potential on GPCR-mediated processes (6Mason M.J. Hussain J.F. Mahaut-Smith M.P. J. Physiol. 2000; 524: 437-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 7Slutsky I. Parnas H. Parnas I. J. Physiol. 1999; 514: 769-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 8Slutsky I. Wess J. Gomeza J. Dudel J. Parnas I. Parnas H. J. Neurophysiol. 2003; 89: 1954-1967Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), the step at which the voltage sensitivity resides was not directly discerned. In particular, it was not established whether the voltage sensitivity resides in the GPCR itself or in other components and/or steps involved in the overall process. Recently, however, using the Xenopus oocytes expression system, Ben-Chaim et al. (9Ben-Chaim Y. Tour O. Dascal N. Parnas I. Parnas H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22482-22491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) showed that both the M2 and the M1-muscarinic receptors are by themselves voltage-sensitive; their affinity toward ACh depends on membrane potential. The question that we address here is whether also GPCRs belonging to the mGluRs family exhibit by themselves voltage sensitivity. We selected the mGluRs, because members of this family are involved in most fundamental processes in the central nervous system (10Pin J.P. Duvoisin R. Neuropharmacology. 1995; 34: 1-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (1228) Google Scholar) (i.e. control of release of various neurotransmitters (11Schoepp D.D. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2001; 299: 12-20PubMed Google Scholar), neurotoxicity, and synaptic plasticity (12Conn P.J. Pin J.P. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1997; 37: 205-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (2691) Google Scholar)). We specifically selected mGluRs that are coupled to different G-proteins: mGluR3 that is coupled to Gi/Go class (12Conn P.J. Pin J.P. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1997; 37: 205-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (2691) Google Scholar) and mGluR1a that is coupled to Gq (13Houamed K.M. Kuijper J.L. Gilbert T.L. Haldeman B.A. O'Hara P.J. Mulvihill E.R. Almers W. Hagen F.S. Science. 1991; 252: 1318-1321Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). Using Xenopus oocytes, we show that both mGluR3 and mGluR1a are voltage-sensitive. Preparation of Oocytes and cRNA—Xenopus laevis oocytes were isolated and incubated in NDE96 solution composed of ND96 (96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.5), with the addition of 2.5 mm Na+ pyruvate, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (14Dascal N. Lotan I. Longstaff A. Revest P. Methods in Molecular Neurobiology. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1992: 205-225Google Scholar). A day after their isolation, the oocytes were injected (Picoshpritzer, PLI-100; Medical Systems Corp.) with the relevant cRNAs. In vitro synthesis of RNA transcripts from the cloned cDNA was performed using standard procedures (14Dascal N. Lotan I. Longstaff A. Revest P. Methods in Molecular Neurobiology. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1992: 205-225Google Scholar). The chimeric receptors R1a/3(i1,i2) and R1a/3(i2,i3), a gift from J. P. Pin (Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique), were described in detail by Gomeza et al. (15Gomeza J. Joly C. Kuhn R. Knopfel T. Bockaert J. Pin J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2199-2205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Both chimeras were subcloned into the pGEMHE vector (16Liman E.R. Tytgat J. Hess P. Neuron. 1992; 9: 861-871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar). The chimeric Gαi3/q was a gift from N. Dascal (Tel-Aviv University, Israel). The amounts of cRNA injected per oocyte were as follows: GIRK1 and GIRK2, 0.2 ng; Gαi3 and Gαi3/q, 2 ng; mGluR3, 5 ng; mGluR1a, 0.4 ng, and R1a/3(i1,i2) and R1a/3(i2,i3), 4.5 ng. For the [3H]Glu binding experiments, both mGluR1a and mGluR3 were subcloned into the pGEMHE vector, which provides 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions of the Xenopus β-globin RNA, ensuring a high level of protein expression in the oocytes (16Liman E.R. Tytgat J. Hess P. Neuron. 1992; 9: 861-871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar). The amounts of cRNA injected per oocyte were the same as for the current measurements except for the mGluR1a, which was 5 ng. Current Measurements—The currents were measured 3–5 days after cRNA injection and were recorded using the standard two-electrode voltage clamp technique (Axoclamp 2B amplifier, Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). The oocyte was impaled with two electrodes pulled from 1.5-mm Clark capillaries (CEI, Pangbourne, UK). Both electrodes were filled with 100 mm KCl solution in order to prevent elevation of [K+]in. The recording and the current-passing electrode resistances were 15 and 1 megaohms, respectively. pCLAMP8 software (Axon Instruments) was used for data acquisition and analysis. mGluR3-induced GIRK Currents—For measurements of mGluR3-induced GIRK currents (17Sharon D. Vorobiov D. Dascal N. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 109: 477-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), oocytes injected with cRNA of GIRK1, GIRK2, Gαi3, and mGluR3 were voltage-clamped at either –80 mV or +40 mV in ND96 solution (see example in Fig. 1B). cRNA of Gαi3 was injected in order to decrease the basal GIRK current (IK) that is produced by free endogenous Gβγ (18Dascal N. Cell. Signal. 1997; 9: 551-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar) and hence to improve the relative activation of the GIRK channels by the agonist (19Peleg S. Varon D. Ivanina T. Dessauer C.W. Dascal N. Neuron. 2002; 33: 87-99Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). To measure K+ currents, ND96 was replaced by 24 mm K+ solution (similar to ND96 but with 72 mm NaCl, 24 mm KCl, and pH adjusted with KOH), and IK appeared (20Vorobiov D. Levin G. Lotan I. Dascal N. Pflugers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1998; 436: 56-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Then four Glu concentrations were applied in an increasing order, without washout between applications, and the mGluR3-induced GIRK currents (IGlu) appeared. IGlu was terminated upon Glu washout (see example in Fig. 1A). After a 10-min washout in ND96, the oocyte was voltage-clamped to the next holding potential, and the procedure was repeated. The order of the holding potentials was randomly selected. Such a continuous exposure to Glu (∼3 min) may distort the true DR curve if the receptor undergoes desensitization. mGluR3 does not exhibit desensitization in a time scale of seconds (17Sharon D. Vorobiov D. Dascal N. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 109: 477-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1B), yet it might undergo desensitization with a slow time constant in the range of minutes. To check for this possibility, the following experiment was conducted (see one example in Fig. 1A). Four concentrations of Glu (30, 80, 300, and 20,000 nm) were applied sequentially. After 10 min of washout, only 30 and 20,000 nm Glu were reapplied. The ratio between IGlu induced by 30 nm and IGlu induced by 20,000 nm was measured under the two experimental protocols. The ratio of IGlu (30 nM)/IGlu (20,000 nM) was found to be 0.21 at the first application and 0.23 at the second application. In a total of five experiments, the average ratio was found to be 0.25 ± 0.59 when four concentrations of Glu were applied and 0.25 ± 0.77 when only 30 and 20,000 nm were applied. These results indicate that the mGluR3 did not desensitize in the course of the 3-min experiment. The results further show that the 10-min washout between the measurements in the two holding potentials does not affect the reliability of the DR curves. Chimeric R1a/3(i1,i2)- and R1a/3(i2,i3)-induced GIRK Currents—The activity of R1a/3(i1,i2) and R1a/3(i2,i3) was measured as described above for the mGluR3 in oocytes injected with cRNA of GIRK1, GIRK2, Gαi3, and R1a/3(i1,i2), or R1a/3(i2,i3). A control experiment similar to that described in Fig. 1A was repeated for the chimeric receptors, with similar results (data not shown). mGluR1a-mediated Cl– Currents—For measurements of mGluR1a-induced Ca2+-activated Cl– currents (ICl(Ca)), oocytes injected with cRNA of mGluR1a were placed in ND96 solution and voltage-clamped to either –80 or +40 mV. Then a specific Glu concentration was applied, and ICl(Ca) appeared (see example in Fig. 3A). The Cl– channel undergoes inactivation (see Fig. 3A), and tens of minutes are required for full recovery (21Boton R. Singer D. Dascal N. Pflugers. Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1990; 416: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). We thus examined the duration of washout needed under our experimental conditions for full recovery of the ICl(Ca). To do so, a saturating concentration of Glu (200 μm) was applied, and the induced ICl(Ca) was measured. Then, after various times of Glu washout, the same Glu concentration was reapplied, and the ratio of ICl(Ca) before and after the washout was determined. We found that the shortest time required for full recovery of ICl(Ca) is 20 min. In a total of three experiments, the average ratio between ICl(Ca) before and after the 20-min washout was 1.06 ± 0.05 (data not shown). mGluR1a-mediated GIRK Currents via Coupling to Chimeric Gαi3/q—The mGluR1a-induced GIRK currents were measured in oocytes injected with cRNAs of GIRK1, GIRK2, mGluR1a, and chimeric Gαi3/q. 30 minutes before the recordings, the oocytes were injected with 25 nl of 50 mm 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid and 600 μm U-73122 (an inhibitor of phosphlipase C) and incubated in 10 μm U-73122 (17Sharon D. Vorobiov D. Dascal N. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 109: 477-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). IGlu was measured as described for mGluR3. Radioligand Binding Experiments—Binding of radiolabeled ligand was performed by a procedure developed specifically for single Xenopus oocytes (9Ben-Chaim Y. Tour O. Dascal N. Parnas I. Parnas H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22482-22491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). We measured binding of l-[G-3H]glutamic acid (50 Ci/mmol; Amersham Biosciences) or [3H]LY341495 (34.61 Ci/mmol; Tockris Cookson, Bristol, UK) to oocytes injected with cRNA of mGluR3 or mGluR1a or R1a/3(i2,i3), at two membrane potentials. Oocytes were also injected with cRNA of GIRK1 and GIRK2 and also with Gαi3 in the case of mGluR3 and R1a/3(i2,i3). Variations in membrane potential were achieved by changing the [K+]out while osmolarity and ionic strength were kept constant by replacing NaCl with KCl. GIRK channels were expressed in order to amplify the difference between the membrane potentials thus achieved. The membrane potential of the oocytes at the different K+ solutions was measured with a standard intracellular electrode. Oocytes not injected with the GIRK channel exhibited at ND96 solution a resting potential of –31.8 ± 3 mV (n = 6), whereas the resting potential of oocytes injected with the GIRK channel shifted to –82 ± 2.6 mV (n = 9). In high K+ solution (similar to 24 mm K+ solution but with 2 mm NaCl and 96 mm KCl), the oocytes, either injected or uninjected with GIRK channels, were depolarized to +3 ± 0.75 mV (n = 6). Single oocytes were incubated for 90 s with the indicated concentrations of radioligand, in either ND96 or high K+ solution. Each oocyte was rapidly dropped into a washing chamber filled with 4 ml of ice-cold ligand-free ND96 or high K+ solution. In less than 1 s, the oocyte reached the bottom of the washing chamber and was collected by a pipette into a vial containing 3 ml of scintillation liquid. Nonspecific binding was measured similarly but in the presence of saturating concentrations of a selective nonradioactive ligand in the incubation solution: 5 μm LY-379268 (a generous gift of Lilly Research Laboratories) for mGluR3 and 0.3 mm quisqualate (Tockris Cookson) for mGluR1a and R1a/3(i2,i3). It should be noted that nonspecific binding varied between oocytes from different donors. Specific binding was calculated for each experiment by subtraction of the average nonspecific binding at each radioligand concentration and each membrane potential (5–10 oocytes), from the total binding to individual oocytes. Binding of [3H]Glu, as described above, was also measured in control oocytes injected only with GIRK subunits. Binding of [3H]Glu was also measured, as above, in perforated oocytes. The oocytes were gently impaled with a standard recording electrode several times (but remained intact), and their resting potential was measured to be –26 ± 1.6 mV at ND96 and +2 ± 0.9 mV (n = 36) at high K+ solution. Data Analysis—The electrophysiological DR curves as well as the radioligand binding data were fitted with Equation 1, a Michaelis-Menten type equation assuming two agonist binding sites. Y=Bmax×X2/(Kd+X)2(Eq. 1) In the case of the DR curves, Y is the fractional amplitude of the current at any agonist concentration, Bmax is the response to saturating concentration of agonist defined as 100%, X is the concentration of the agonist (Glu), and Kd denotes the dissociation constant. In the case of the binding data, Y is the specific binding, Bmax is the maximal binding, and X and Kd are as above. The DR curves of mGluR3-induced GIRK currents were also fitted with Equation 2, a Michaelis-Menten type equation that assumes the existence of two populations of receptors and two agonist binding sites. Y=BmaxH×X2/(KdH+X)2+BmaxL×X2/(KdL+X)2(Eq. 2) KHd denotes the Kd of the high affinity population, KLd denotes the Kd of the low affinity population, BHmax is the fraction of the high affinity population, and BLmax is the fraction of the low affinity population. The sum of the two fractions is set to be 100%. Y and X are the same as in Equation 1. For all of the curves, the data were best fitted with the assumption of two agonist binding sites, in particular in the low Glu concentrations. This is in agreement with the dimerization of mGluRs and with the reports that full activation requires binding of Glu to both subunits in the homodimer (22Kammermeier P.J. Yun J. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2005; 312: 502-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 23Kniazeff J. Bessis A.S. Maurel D. Ansanay H. Prezeau L. Pin J.P. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 706-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). The decay time constants of GIRK currents (Figs. 4D and 6) were analyzed by fitting a single exponent to the falling phase of the current trace. In all fittings, the least-square method was employed. Least-square fitting and t test statistical analysis were performed with Prism software (GraphPad). Statistical results are presented as mean ± S.E. Chemicals were purchased from Sigma Israel (Rehovot, Israel), unless otherwise stated.FIGURE 6Depolarization affects the off-rates of mGluR3 and mGluR1a.

Vorobiov D. Dascal N. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 109: 477-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The GIRK channel undergoes inward rectification that occurs at potentials more positive than –50 mV (24Perier F. Coulter K.L. Radeke C.M. Vandenberg C.A. J. Neurochem. 1992; 59: 1971-1974Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 2A). In order to unravel whether membrane potential exerts, in addition to its effect on the GIRK channel, also an effect on mGluR3 itself, we compared the dependence of IGlu on Glu concentration, DR, at two holding potentials of –80 and +40 mV. The protocol for the DR curves construction is described in the legend to Fig. 1B and under “Experimental Procedures.” To evaluate IGlu, we notice that the amplitude of IK declines with time (broken line in Fig. 1A; see Ref. 20Vorobiov D. Levin G. Lotan I. Dascal N. Pflugers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1998; 436: 56-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Therefore, the magnitude of IGlu (dotted line) was calculated by subtraction of the extrapolated IK from the total current. The DR curves were constructed by normalizing IGlu to the response obtained with the saturating concentration of Glu (20,000 nm) at the same holding potential. Normalization is required to compensate for the intrinsically different IK obtained at the two holding potentials of –80 and +40 mV in a single oocyte and to be able to compare between oocytes varying in their I-V relation. Fig. 1C shows a clear shift to the right of the DR curve at +40 mV. Fitting the data with Equation 1 (solid lines) indicates that depolarization shifted the apparent Kd from 38 ± 2.4 nm at –80 mV to 136 ± 9 nm at +40 mV (p < 0.001, n = 28) (i.e. a 3.5-fold increase). Concerning GPCRs, it was shown that they exist in two affinity states toward their agonist: high affinity when coupled to the G-protein and low affinity while free (25De Lean A. Stadel J.M. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 7108-7117Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests that the data of Fig. 1C may also be fitted by an equation assuming the existence of two populations of receptors. Indeed, the data could be fitted with Equation 2 (broken lines), showing that at –80 mV a high affinity population prevails (Kd = 38 nm, 98%), whereas at +40 mV the high affinity population accounts for only 10% of the receptors, and 90% of the receptors are at a low affinity state (Kd = 160 nm). However, since both equations fit the data equally well, we cannot conclude at this stage whether depolarization affects the Kd itself or reduces the high affinity population. The observed shift in the DR curve may be caused by cellular changes due to the long depolarization rather than by a reversible specific effect of depolarization on the mGluR3. To check for this possibility, after measuring a DR curve at –80 mV, the holding potential was switched to +40 mV for a period of 10 min and then switched back to –80 mV, and a DR curve was remeasured. Fig. 1D rules out this possibility, since the DR curves established at –80 mV before and after the depolarization period were practically identical. Some of the oocytes contain voltage-dependent Na+ channels (26Baud C. Kado R.T. J. Physiol. 1984; 356: 275-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) that could potentially distort the DR curves. This possibility can be ruled out, since the results obtained in oocytes that did not contain voltage-dependent Na+ channels (Fig. 1C, empty symbols) are indistinguishable from the rest of the data. Application of Glu may activate endogenous Glu receptors or channels other than GIRK. This possibility is ruled out, since uninjected oocytes, as well as oocytes injected with cRNA of mGluR3 but without the GIRK channels, did not show any current in response to Glu application at both holding potentials of –80 and +40 mV (data not shown). The Voltage Sensitivity Does Not Reside in the Activation of the GIRK Channel—The shift in the DR curve seen in Fig. 1C could be due to voltage sensitivity in steps that are downstream to the activation of the mGluR3. For example, Hommers et al. (27Hommers L.G. Lohse M.J. Bunemann M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1037-1043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) suggested that Gβγ subunits not only activate the GIRK channel but also, at high concentrations, directly affect the rectification properties of the channel. To check for this possibility, we compared the I-V relation of the basal GIRK current, IK-V, to the I-V relation of mGluR3-induced GIRK current, IGlu(20 μM)-V, obtained with saturating Glu concentration. At a saturating Glu concentration, any putative effect of membrane potential on the receptor affinity is abolished. Hence, if the IGlu(20 μM)-V differs from IK-V, it will support the suggestion of Hommers et al. (27Hommers L.G. Lohse M.J. Bunemann M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1037-1043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The results of such experiments are depicted in Fig. 2A. It is seen that the two curves practically overlap. In particular, in a total of 20 experiments, the ratio I+40 mV/I–80 mV was 0.042 ± 0.003 for IK and 0.045 ± 0.004 for IGlu(20 μM), implying that the voltage sensitivity seen in Fig. 1C does not reside in the step of activation of the GIRK channel. The Binding of [3H]Glu to Oocytes Expressing mGluR3 Is Voltage-dependent—To check directly whether the voltage sensitivity seen in Fig. 1C resides in the activation of mGluR3, we measured binding of [3H]Glu to individual oocytes expressing mGluR3 at two membrane potentials. Variations in membrane potential were induced by changing the [K+]out, using ND96 and high K+ solutions. An example of one experiment is depicted in Fig. 2B, presenting the average total, nonspecific, and specific binding of 100 nm [3H]Glu to individual oocytes. The nonspecific binding was measured in the presence of the selective mGluR3 agonist LY-379268 (28Monn J.A. Valli M.J. Massey S.M. Hansen M.M. Kress T.J. Wepsiec J.P. Harkness A.R. Grutsch Jr., J.L. Wright R.A. Johnson B.G. Andis S.L. Kingston A. Tomlinson R. Lewis R. Griffey K.R. Tizzano J.P. Schoepp D.D. J. Med. Chem. 1999; 42: 1027-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). It is seen that the specific binding of [3H]Glu is voltage-dependent; it is significantly higher at ND96 solution than at high K+ (p = 0.0183, n = 6–14). In a similar experiment, but with control oocytes that do not express mGluR3, no specific binding was observed. In particular, in high K+, the total binding was 2573 ± 123 dpm, and the nonspecific binding was 2434 ± 227 dpm (p = 0.6, n = 6). At ND96, the total binding was 2245 ± 157 dpm, and the nonspecific binding was 2386 ± 180 dpm (p = 0.57, n = 7). These results indicate that the specific binding obtained with LY-379268 reflects binding only to the mGluR3 and not to other putative endogenous receptors. Fig. 2C depicts results of experiments similar to the experiment described in Fig. 2B, obtained with various [3H]Glu concentrations. The average specific binding of [3H]Glu was significantly higher at ND96 solution than at high K+ at all Glu concentrations. To examine whether it is the K+-induced depolarization or the actual K+ concentration that produces the results of Fig. 2A, we measured the binding of one concentration of [3H]Glu to perforated oocytes that are depolarized also at ND96 (see “Experimental Procedures”). The binding of 75 nm [3H]Glu to perforated oocytes was similar at ND96 and high K+ solution (5.4 ± 1.1 and 6.1 ± 1.4 fmol of [3H]Glu/oocyte, respectively; p = 0.7, n = 8–10) and was not significantly different from the binding to unperforated oocytes at high K+ (7.8 ± 0.36 fmol of [3H]Glu/oocyte; p = 0.42). This result indicates that it is indeed the voltage, and not K+ concentration, that affects [3H]Glu binding to mGluR3. The binding results corroborate the electrophysiological ones. As mentioned, the electrophysiological results could not discern whether depolarization reduces the fraction of the high affinity receptors or affects the Kd itself. The binding experiments, conducted in low [3H]Glu concentrations at which [3H]Glu is expected to bind mainly to the high affinity population, allow the distinction between thes"

Yke4p was localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane using Yke4p-specific antiserum. YKE4 is not an essential gene; however, deletion of YKE4 resulted in a sensitivity to calcofluor white and poor growth at 36 °C on respiratory substrates containing high zinc. Overexpression of transition metal transporters Zrc1p and Cot1p or the mouse orthologue mKe4 in Δyke4 suppressed the poor growth at 36 °C on respiratory substrates. We found that the role of Yke4p depends on the zinc status of the cells. In a zinc-adequate environment, Yke4p transports zinc into the secretory pathway, and the deletion of YKE4 leads to a zinc-suppressible cell wall defect. In high zinc medium, transport of zinc into the secretory pathway through Yke4p is a way to eliminate zinc from the cytosol, and deletion of YKE4 leads to toxic zinc accumulation in the cytosol. Under low cytosolic zinc conditions, however, Yke4p removes zinc from the secretory pathway, and deletion of YKE4 partially compensates for the loss of Msc2p, an ER zinc importer, and therefore helps to alleviate ER stress. In our model, Yke4p balances zinc levels between the cytosol and the secretory pathway, whereas the previously described Msc2p-Zrg17p ER zinc importer complex functions mainly in zinc-depleted conditions to ensure a ready supply of zinc essential for ER functions, such as phospholipid biosynthesis and unfolded protein response.

Zinc is not redox-active; however, its ability to form multiple bonds has made it an important structural component in hundreds of different enzymes; about 3% of human genes are thought to encode zinc-binding proteins (1Eide D.J. J. Nutr. 2003; 133: 1532S-1535SCrossref PubMed Google Scholar). Eukaryotic zinc transporters are grouped into two families, the cation diffusion family (CDF or SLC30) and the ZRT, IRT-like protein (ZIP or SLC39) family (2Eide D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 573-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 3Kambe T. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Sasaki R. Nagao M. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2004; 61: 49-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Members of the CDF family include the yeast Zrc1p, Cot1p, Msc2p, and Zrg17p proteins and the human and mouse ZNT1–8. These transporters are thought to be proton-metal antiporters. Based on sequence similarity, there are now hundreds of proteins in the current sequence data bases belonging to the ZIP family. The ZIP family can be divided into four large families. One of these families, the LIV1/KE4 family, contains several transporters, such as the human and mouse ZIP4, the fruit fly FOI, and the zebrafish LIV1 (4Taylor K.M. Nicholson R.I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1611: 16-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). These transporters (ZIP4, FOI, and LIV1) form a subfamily, usually named after LIV1, which was the first gene of this group to be identified. Although the Ke4-like proteins share many features with the LIV1 group, they form a separate subfamily that is present in all investigated eukaryotes. The human, mouse, zebrafish, Drosophila melanogaster, Arabidopsis thaliana, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae KE4-like genes are orthologous. It is of interest that the mammalian KE4 gene is located in the major histocompatibility complex. It is generally thought that the CDF and ZIP families play opposing roles in eukaryotic zinc transport; CDF proteins lower the cytosolic zinc content by transporting zinc out of the cell or into intracellular organelles, whereas the ZIP proteins increase cytosolic zinc by transporting zinc into the cells or out of intracellular organelles. Consistent with this view, a recent study has suggested that the mouse Ke4 is a Golgi zinc exporter (5Huang L. Kirschke C.P. Zhang Y. Yu Y.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 15456-15463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). We have investigated the function of the yeast Ke4 protein. Here we provide genetic and biochemical evidence that shows that Yke4p is capable of transporting zinc in both directions. Since the mouse Ke4 gene can substitute for the yeast and A. thaliana genes, we suggest that bidirectional transport may be conserved in all eukaryotes. Yeast Strains, Growth Media, and Plasmids—Yeast strains used in this study are shown in Table 1. YKE4 and PSD1 (phosphatidylserine decarboxylase 1) were deleted in W303 wild type cells (DY150), utilizing the KanMX4 cassette. KanMX4 cassette-disrupted open reading frames were PCR-amplified from the genome-wide deletion collection (Invitrogen) using the following primers: YKE4 PR1032, 5′-AGT AGA ATT TCT GCG GAG AAC-3′ and PR1033 5′-TCC AGT TAT CGA ATT CTC CTG-3′; PSD1 PR1235, 5′-GG TAC GTA GCG CTT TAA GGA-3′; and PR1236, 5′-AAG GGG TAC ATG ACA TGG CT-3′. The PCR-amplified yke4::KanMX4 cassette was transformed into DY150 cells. psd1::KanMX4 cassette was transformed into both DY1457 (MATα) and DY150 (MATa) strains. DY1457Δpsd1 was used to mate the DY150-based strains to create double and triple mutant cells. The double and triple deletion strains were confirmed by PCR analysis.TABLE 1Cell lines used in this studyStrainGenotypeSourceDY150MATa, ura3-52, leu2-3, 112, trp1-1, his3-11, ade2-1, can1-100(oc)W303 wild typeDY1457MATα, ura3-52, leu2-3, 112, trp1-1, his3-11, ade6-1, can1-100(oc)W303 wild typeΔyke4DY150 yke4::KanMX4This studyΔmsc2DY150 msc2::HIS3Li and Kaplan (11Li L.

ADH1 promoter-driven expression of YKE4 was achieved by cloning the open reading frame into p415ADH1 plasmid with primers PR1050 (5′-ATT GGA TCC ATG AAG GCG TCG CAC ATT TGC-3′) and PR1051 (5′-TAA CTC GAG GAT CTG ATC TGA TTA TCG CCT G-3′). The mouse Ke4 cDNA was amplified from National Institutes of Health Swiss mouse thymus RNA using PR1053 (5′-ATG ACC ATG GGC CTG CGG GC-3′) and PR1054 (5′-CTA CGT AGA TAA ATC CGC CTG CA-3′) and cloned using the TA-cloning Kit from Invitrogen. To express the mouse Ke4 gene in yeast, the mouse promoter and putative leader (first 25 amino acids) sequence were replaced with the yeast promoter (−1000 bp) and putative leader sequences (first 20 amino acids); the leader sequenceless mKe4 was amplified with PR1237 (5′-TAA GCC GGC CAC GAG GGT CAT GGT GAC CT-3′) and PR1238 (5′-TAA TCT CGA GTC ACT CAA GAT GGG CAA TCA GT-3′), and the yeast promoter and leader sequences were amplified using PR1241 (5′-TAA GAA TTC AGG CCT CAG ACT CGC CTA AC-3′) and PR1240 (5′-CA CCC CTA GTG GTG TCC CAT GCC GGC TTA-3′). These primers introduce a silent NaeI site; they replace the original Ala-Gly (amino acids 26–27) codons of mouse Ke4 with GCC GGC that also encode Ala-Gly but create a NaeI site. The engineered fragments were cloned into pTF63 plasmid. Plasmids containing ZRC1 or COT1 were obtained from Dr. D. Conklin (6Conklin D.S. McMaster J.A. Culbertson M.R. Kung C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3678-3688Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). The KEX2-HA and pZRG17 plasmids were obtained from Dr. David Eide (University of Wisconsin). pMET3-MSC2 was published (11Li L. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5036-5043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). PCL1 was PCR-amplified and cloned into pTF63 using PR1065 (5′-TCC CCC GGG TCT GGC TCT AGT GTT CTG CG-3′) and PR1066 (5′-TCC CCC GGG CAC CCG AAT GGA AGT TAT AAC G-3′). RPL23A was identified by subcloning of the original library clone isolated from the screen. Cells were grown in rich media, YPD (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% dextrose) and YPGE (yeast extract, peptone, 2% glycerol, 2% ethanol), or in synthetic complete medium (CM; 0.67% yeast nitrogen base, 0.12% drop-out amino acid mix, and carbon source: 2% glucose, 2% galactose, or 2% glycerol plus 2% ethanol). Low zinc media were made from Bio 101 divalent cation-free yeast nitrogen base (Bio 101) by fully supplementing calcium, magnesium, iron, manganese, and copper and providing the specified amount of zinc. High Copy Suppressor Screen—To identify high copy supressors of the high zinc sensitivity of Δyke4 cells, a genomic library cloned into YEp13 was transformed into Δyke4. About 18,000 colonies were replica-plated onto YPGE plates containing 5.5 mm zinc. The plates were incubated at 36 °C for 6 days. Twenty-seven colonies were identified. After repeated testing of these colonies, nine were found to grow on high zinc plates. The plasmids were rescued and transformed into Escherichia coli (DH10B; Invitrogen) by electroporation. The genomic inserts in the plasmids were sequenced using PR0324 (5′-CCA CTA TCG ACT ACG CGA-3′) and PR0325 (5′-ATG TCG GCG ATA TAG GCG-3′) and then subcloned to determine the specific genes responsible for the suppression. Antibody Generation and Western Blotting—To make anti-bodies against Yke4p and mouse Ke4, we generated synthetic peptides of NRDHGHEANHES (amino acids 25–36 of Yke4p) and GAVDSDVAGG of mKe4 (amino acids 411–420) that are in hydrophilic regions of Ke4 proteins. The peptides were conjugated to bovine serum albumin using gluteraldehyde, and the conjugate was injected into rabbits using complete Freund's adjuvant (Calbiochem). The anti-Ke4p antibodies were affinity-purified using ovalbumin-conjugated peptide linked to an AminoLink Plus resin according to the manufacturer's protocol (Pierce). Immunofluorescence—Yeast cells were processed for immunofluorescence as previously described (7Felice M.R. De Domenico I. Li L. Ward D.M. Bartok B. Musci G. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 22181-22190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The affinity-purified rabbit anti-Yke4p antibody was used at a 1:20 dilution followed by a 1:750 dilution of Alexa594-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Molecular Probes). To detect Kex2p-HA, cells were incubated with a 1:100 dilution of mouse anti-HA (Covance) followed by a 1:750 dilution of Alexa594-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Molecular Probes). Anti-Dpm1 antibody (Molecular Probes) was used at a 1:50 dilution followed by a 1:750 dilution of Alexa594- or Alexa488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Molecular Probes). Images were captured on an Olympus epifluorescent microscope. C57BL/6 mouse fibroblasts were grown on coverslips in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and processed for immunofluorescence as described previously (8Ward D.M. Shiflett S.L. Huynh D. Vaughn M.B. Prestwich G. Kaplan J. Traffic. 2003; 4: 403-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The rabbit anti-mKe4 serum was used at a 1:100 dilution followed by an Alexa488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:750) (Molecular Probes). Subcellular Fractionation—Cells were spheroplasted and homogenized, and organelles were separated by fractionation on iodixanol (OptiPrep) gradients (0–25%), and the fractions were analyzed by Western blotting. Western blots were probed with antibodies to Kex2p-HA, a Golgi marker (1:1000; mouse anti-HA (Covance)), Dpm1p, an ER 2The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; CM, complete synthetic medium; IAA, indole-3-acetic acid; UPR, unfolded protein response; UPRE, unfolded protein response element; YPD, yeast extract-peptone-dextrose; YPGE, yeast extract-peptone-glycerol-ethanol; ZRE, zinc response element; GE, glycerol and ethanol. marker (1:500; mouse anti-Dpm1p (Molecular Probes)), Porin, a mitochondrial marker (1:1000; mouse anti-porin (Molecular Probes)), and alkaline phosphatase, a vacuole membrane marker (1:1000; mouse anti-alkaline phosphatase (Molecular Probes)) followed by peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG or goat anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch). Western Lightning Chemiluminescence Reagent (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was used for visualization. β-Galactosidase Enzyme Assay—We used β-galactosidase reporter gene constructs to indirectly estimate the ER and cytoplasmic zinc concentrations. The unfolded protein response element (UPRE) containing the upstream activation element from the promoter of the KAR2 gene (UPRE-lacZ; pMCZY or pMCZY-L) (9Ellis C.D. Wang F. MacDiarmid C.W. Clark S.

The β-galactosidase enzymatic activity was measured as previously described (11Li L. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5036-5043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Localization of Ke4 Protein to the ER/Golgi Apparatus—To identify the cellular localization of Ke4, we generated anti-peptide antibodies against both mouse and yeast Ke4 proteins. Western blotting and immunofluorescence microscopy were used to test the affinity-purified antisera (Fig. 1). The specificity of anti-Yke4p antiserum was tested on lysates from wild type, Δyke4, and Δyke4 cells in which YKE4 was provided on a plasmid. Lysates from Δyke4 cells transformed with a plasmid containing YKE4 expressed under the control of its endogenous promoter showed a novel band migrating at ∼33 kDa that was not seen in lysates from Δyke4 cells (Fig. 1A). The addition of the immunogenic peptide to the antiserum blocked the detection of the Yke4p band. The predicted mass of the protein, based on the amino acid composition of YIL023C, is 33.7 kDa. The localization of Yke4p was examined by subcellular fractionation. Cells were spheroplasted and homogenized and organelles were separated by fractionation on iodixanol gradients, and the fractions were analyzed by Western blotting using the anti-peptide antibody. Organelles were identified by specific markers. The Golgi was identified in cells transformed with a plasmid expressing Kex2p-HA, which was then immunostained with an anti-HA antibody. The ER was identified by antibodies directed against Dpm1p and mitochondria identified using antibodies directed against Porin. The Yke4p fractions also contain Dpm1p (Fig. 1B), indicating that Yke4p is present in fractions enriched in ER membranes. The localization of Yke4p was confirmed using immunofluorescence. Wild type cells, expressing KEX2-HA on a plasmid, were stained with the affinity-purified rabbit anti-Yke4p antiserum followed by an Alexa594-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG or mouse anti-HA (Covance) antibody to detect Kex2p-HA followed by Alexa594-conjugated goat-anti-mouse IgG. The images showed a perinuclear localization typical of the ER in S. cerevisiae for Yke4p and a punctate staining for the Golgi-localized Kex2-HA (Fig. 1C). There was, however, co-localization of Yke4p and the ER protein Dpm1p (Fig. 1D). These results suggest that Yke4p is localized to the ER. The localization of Yke4p was investigated under both high and low zinc conditions and was unaffected by media zinc concentration. The mouse Ke4 protein was localized by immunofluorescence. Mouse fibroblasts stained with a mouse-specific anti-Ke4 antibody showed a robust staining of the Golgi apparatus (Fig. 1E). In addition to the Golgi stacks, large numbers of vesicles, probably secretory vesicles, also stained positive for mKe4. Huang et al. (5Huang L. Kirschke C.P. Zhang Y. Yu Y.Y. J. Biol.

Ke4p localization in mouse cells was unaltered in zinc limiting or zinc replete conditions (data not shown). We conclude, therefore, that the Ke4 protein is mainly localized to the Golgi apparatus in mouse cells, whereas it mainly localizes to the ER in yeast. Δyke4 Cells Are Sensitive to High Zinc—The YKE4 gene was disrupted in a W303 strain using a KanMX4 deletion cassette, and the gene deletion was confirmed by PCR. The Δyke4 strain was tested for common phenotypes, such as growth on various carbon sources, as well as sensitivities to temperature, osmotic changes, cell wall-damaging agents, and high and low transition metals. We found that Δyke4 cells did not grow at elevated temperatures (36–38 °C) on high zinc (3.5–5.5 mm ZnSO4) on media containing the respiratory substrates glycerol and ethanol (GE) as carbon sources. The high zinc sensitivity phenotype of Δyke4 cells was suppressed by providing the YKE4 gene on either a low or high copy plasmid using either its own promoter (Fig. 2) or the constitutively active ADH1 promoter (not shown). We also demonstrated that expression of mouse Ke4 in Δyke4 cells could suppress the high zinc-sensitive phenotype of these cells, suggesting that the function of yeast and mouse proteins is conserved (Fig. 2). Extragenic Suppression of the Zinc-sensitive Phenotype of Δyke4 Cells—We took advantage of the zinc-sensitive phenotype of Δyke4 cells grown on YPGE medium at 36 °C to identify genes that could suppress that phenotype (Fig. 3A). A yeast genomic library cloned into a high copy plasmid vector (YEp13) was used to transform Δyke4 cells (18,000 colonies), resulting in nine colonies that were resistant to high zinc (5.5 mm) on GE medium at 36 °C. Five plasmids contained ZRC1, three contained PCL1, and one contained RPL23A. PCL1 encodes a cell cycle-regulated cyclin gene that is expressed in the G1 phase (12Espinoza F.H. Ogas J. Herskowitz I. Morgan D.O. Science. 1994; 266: 1388-1391Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), RPL23A encodes a ribosomal protein that is part of the 60 S large subunit (13Suzuki K. Wool I.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2755-2761Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and ZRC1 encodes a vacuolar zinc transporter that mediates the uptake of zinc from cytosol (14MacDiarmid C.W. Gaither L.A. Eide D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2845-2855Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Zrc1p is a vacuolar zinc importer. Overexpression of Zrc1p decreases cytosolic zinc (14MacDiarmid C.W. Gaither L.A. Eide D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2845-2855Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar), suggesting that the cause of the high zinc sensitivity of the Δyke4 cell is increased cytosolic zinc. This hypothesis is further supported by overexpressing a second vacuolar zinc importer, Cot1p (14MacDiarmid C.W. Gaither L.A. Eide D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2845-2855Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar), in Δyke4 cells. COT1 on a high copy plasmid also suppressed the zinc sensitivity of the deletion strain (Fig. 3B). We tested the ability of Pcl1p and Rpl23p to suppress the zinc sensitivity of Δzrc1 cells and found that the high copy expression of PCL1 improved the growth of Δzrc1 cells on high zinc plates (3–4 mm zinc in CM) but the expression of RPL23A did not (data not shown). Overexpression of RPL23A and PCL1 Delays the Cell Cycle Arrest Caused by High Metal Concentrations—Pcl1p is a cell cycle-regulated cyclin that binds to Pho85p. The Pho85 cyclin families are defined by sequence similarity and include 10 members, most of which are not regulated by the cell cycle but instead participate in the homeostasis of various metabolites (15Huang D. Moffat J. Andrews B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 5076-5088Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Evidence suggests that high levels of metals can cause cell cycle arrest. Cells expressing the constitutively active allele of the iron-sensitive Aft1p transcription factor, Aft1-1up, accumulate iron due to inappropriately high induction of the elemental iron uptake system. Incubation of aft1-1up cells in iron-containing medium leads to arrest of the cell cycle at the G1 phase. The iron-induced arrest can be bypassed by the overexpression of a mutant G1 cyclin, cln3-2 (16Philpott C.C. Rashford J. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Rouault T.A. Dancis A. Klausner R.D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5026-5036Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). To investigate if Pcl1p is specific to zinc toxicity, we transformed the PCL1-containing high copy plasmid into Δccc1 cells. Ccc1p is a vacuolar iron importer, and Δccc1 cells are sensitive to high iron, since they are unable to store cytosolic iron in their vacuoles (17Li L. Chen O.S. McVey Ward D. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29515-29519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Overexpression of PCL1 was able to rescue the growth arrest of Δccc1 cells, as shown on Fig. 4A, suggesting that Pcl1p is not specific to zinc but protects cells from high cytosolic metal. The connection between zinc and Rpl23ap is not known. Rpl23ap is a component of the large (60 S) ribosomal subunit and similar to the E. coli L14 and rat L23 ribosomal proteins (13Suzuki K. Wool I.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2755-2761Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Many ribosomal proteins contain zinc, but Rpl23ap is not thought to be one of them, since it contains no predicted zinc ribbon motif. In order to determine if Rpl23ap suppresses growth defects due to high cytosolic metals, we examined whether overexpression of Rpl23ap could also affect the high iron growth arrest of the Δccc1 strain. The effect of overexpression of RPL23A was not specific to zinc, since RPL23A was able to able rescue the growth arrest of Δccc1 cells (Fig. 4B). Although the mechanism is unclear, both Pcl1p and Rpl23ap can delay the cell cycle arrest caused by high cytosolic metal concentrations, further suggesting that the cause of cell growth defect of Δyke4 cells on high zinc GE plates is caused by zinc accumulation in the cytosol. Deletion of YKE4 Is Synthetically Lethal with Deletion of MSC2 That Encodes an ER Zinc Importer—The above results indicate that Yke4p can lower cytosolic zinc by transporting zinc into the ER/Golgi system. To investigate the contribution of Yke4p to the secretory pathway zinc content, we generated cells with deletions in both MSC2 and YKE4. Msc2p is an ER zinc importer, and cells with a deletion in MSC2 show an increased ER stress response that can be suppressed by growth in high zinc medium (9Ellis C.D. Wang F. MacDiarmid C.W. Clark S. Lyons T. Eide D.J. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 325-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Cells with a deletion in Δmsc2 or Δyke4 or with a deletion in both genes (Δyke4Δmsc2) have no growth deficit in YPD at 30 °C (Fig. 5A). At elevated temperatures, Δyke4 cells grow like wild type cells, but there is growth retardation for Δmsc2. The double deletion strain does not grow at 38 °C, showing that there is a synthetic lethal effect when both YKE4 and MSC2 are deleted. The addition of zinc (2.0 mm) suppresses the growth defect of the Δmsc2; however, the Δyke4Δmsc2 strain requires higher concentrations of zinc to suppress the growth defect. The synthetic lethality resulting from deletion of YKE4 and MSC2 under these conditions suggests that these transporters are importing zinc into the ER. To test this possibility, we examined the effect of overexpression of the Msc2p-Zrg17p complex on the growth of Δyke4 cells. We hypothesized that overexpression of the ER zinc-importer complex Msc2p-Zrg17p should improve the growth of Δyke4 cells on high zinc plates if Yke4p is an ER zinc importer. Wild type and Δyke4 cells were transformed with a plasmid containing ZRG17 under its own promoter (21Ellis C.D. Macdiarmid C.W. Eide D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 28811-28818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) and a plasmid containing MSC2 under a methionine-regulated MET3 promoter (11Li L. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5036-5043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The cells were grown at 37 °C on zinc-containing CM + GE plates lacking methionine to induce the expression of both ZRG17 and MSC2. Overexpression of ZRG17 or MSC2 alone resulted in no change in the growth of the wild type and Δyke4 strains (Fig. 5B). Overexpression of ZRG17 and MSC2 together, however, led to growth arrest of wild type cells at 37 °C, and this growth arrest was not rescued by high zinc. Overexpression of ZRG17 and MSC2 together rescued the growth defect of Δyke4 cells on high zinc plates (Fig. 5B), supporting the idea that Yke4p may function as an ER zinc importer. Yke4p Is Required for Normal Cell Wall Synthesis—We found that Δyke4 are cells are sensitive to calcofluor white, a dye that binds to cell wall chitin, perturbing cell wall structure and inhibiting cell growth (Fig. 6A). Although it is a chitin-specific dye, mutations affecting other cell wall components can exacerbate the effect of calcofluor white (18Ram A.F. Wolters A. Ten Hoopen R. Klis F.M. Yeast. 1994; 10: 1019-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). The calcofluor white phenotype is complemented by expression of plasmid-encoded YKE4 or mouse Ke4 (data not shown). We tested whether the sensitivity of Δyke4 to calcofluor white can be overcome by the addition of zinc. We used Δgas1 cells as a control to make sure that extracellular zinc does not interfere with the toxicity of calcofluor white. Gas1p is an enzyme, β-1,3-glucanosyltransferase, which is required for proper cell wall synthesis, and deletion of GAS1 leads to calcofluor white sensitivity (19Ram A.F. Brekelmans S.S. Oehlen L.J. Klis F.M. FEBS Lett. 1995; 358: 165-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The missing enzymatic activity cannot be recovered by zinc. Whereas the calcofluor white sensitivity of Δyke4 can be suppressed by excess zinc, zinc did not suppress the calcofluor white sensitivity of Δgas1 cells. We hypothesized that if zinc is required for proper cell wall synthesis in the secretory pathway, then Δmsc2 cells should also have a cell wall defect. We found that Δmsc2 cells are even more sensitive to calcofluor white than Δyke4 cells. As observed for Δyke4 cells, the calcofluor white sensitivity was suppressed by excess zinc in the medium, although the zinc suppression was only partial (Fig. 6B). Zinc Requiring Biosynthetic Processes in the Secretory Pathway—There are no known zinc-requiring proteins or enzymes in the yeast secretory pathway. However, Iwanyshyn et al. (20Iwanyshyn W.M. Han G.S. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21976-21983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) showed that under low zinc conditions, the activities of the phospholipid biosynthetic enzymes are decreased by 25–50%. With the exception of phosphatidylserine decarboxylase 1 (Psd1p), which is a mitochondrial protein, the enzymes required for phospholipid biosynthesis are in the secretory pathway (Fig. 7). We generated a series of mutant strains in which PSD1 is deleted. PSD1 encodes about 95% of the cellular phosphatidylserine decarboxylase activity, and the remaining 5% is provided by the Golgi-localized Psd2p. Δpsd1 cells are viable on rich fermentable media, such as YPD, since Psd2p provi"
https://openalex.org/W2076354599,"Arsenic trioxide (As2O3) is a potent inducer of apoptosis of leukemic cells in vitro and in vivo, but the precise mechanisms by which it mediates such effects are not well defined. We provide evidence that As2O3 induces activation of the mitogen- and stress-activated kinase 1 (MSK1) and downstream phosphorylation of its substrate, histone H3, in leukemia cell lines. Such activation requires upstream engagement of p38 MAPK, as demonstrated by experiments using pharmacological inhibitors of p38 or p38alpha knock-out cells. Arsenic-induced apoptosis was enhanced in cells in which MSK1 expression was decreased using small interfering RNA and in Msk1 knock-out mouse embryonic fibroblasts, suggesting that this kinase is activated in a negative feedback regulatory manner to regulate As2O3 responses. Consistent with this, pharmacological inhibition of MSK1 enhanced the suppressive effects of As2O3 on the growth of primary leukemic progenitors from chronic myelogenous leukemia patients. Altogether, these findings indicate an important role for MSK1 downstream of p38 in the regulation of As2O3 responses."
https://openalex.org/W2079935983,"Production of NADP and NADPH depends on activity of NAD and NADH kinases. Here we characterized all combinations of mutants in yeast NAD and NADH kinases to determine their physiological roles. We constructed a diploid strain heterozygous for disruption of POS5, encoding mitochondrial NADH kinase, UTR1, cytosolic NAD kinase, and YEF1, a UTR1-homologous gene we characterized as encoding a low specific activity cytosolic NAD kinase. pos5 utr1 is a synthetic lethal combination rescued by plasmid-borne copies of the POS5 or UTR1 genes or by YEF1 driven by the ADH1 promoter. Respiratory-deficient and oxidative damage-sensitive defects in pos5 mutants were not made more deleterious by yef1 deletion, and a quantitative growth phenotype of pos5 and its arginine auxotrophy were repaired by plasmid-borne POS5 but not UTR1 or ADH1-driven YEF1. utr1 haploids have a slow growth phenotype on glucose not exacerbated by yef1 deletion but reversed by either plasmid-borne UTR1 or ADH1-driven YEF1. The defect in fermentative growth of utr1 mutants renders POS5 but not POS5-dependent mitochondrial genome maintenance essential because rho–utr1 derivatives are viable. Purified Yef1 has similar nucleoside triphosphate specificity but substantially lower specific activity and less discrimination in favor of NAD versus NADH phosphorylation than Utr1. Low expression and low intrinsic NAD kinase activity of Yef1 and the lack of phenotype associated with yef1 suggest that Utr1 and Pos5 are responsible for essentially all NAD/NADH kinase activity in vivo. The data are compatible with a model in which there is no exchange of NADP, NADPH, or cytoplasmic NAD/NADH kinase between nucleocytoplasmic and mitochondrial compartments, but the cytoplasm is exposed to mitochondrial NAD/NADH kinase during the transit of the molecule. Production of NADP and NADPH depends on activity of NAD and NADH kinases. Here we characterized all combinations of mutants in yeast NAD and NADH kinases to determine their physiological roles.

The data are compatible with a model in which there is no exchange of NADP, NADPH, or cytoplasmic NAD/NADH kinase between nucleocytoplasmic and mitochondrial compartments, but the cytoplasm is exposed to mitochondrial NAD/NADH kinase during the transit of the molecule. NADP is required by the pentose phosphate pathway, and NADPH is required for resistance to oxidative stresses. Deletion mutants in the gene encoding mitochondrial matrix NADH kinase, POS5, are sensitive to growth in hyperoxia, H2O2, and methyl viologen and are also respiratory-deficient (1Outten C.E. Culotta V.C. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2015-2024Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 2Strand M.K. Stuart G.R. Longley M.J. Graziewicz M.A. Dominick O.C. Copeland W.C. Eukaryot. Cell. 2003; 2: 809-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Interestingly, transforming freshly prepared pos5 mutants with a POS5 plasmid restores resistance to reactive oxygen species and growth on nonfermentable carbon sources, but older pos5 mutants lose the ability to have their respiratory defect restored by Pos5 expression. These data suggest that mitochondrial NADPH-dependent antioxidant reductases are required to protect mitochondria from reactive oxygen species damage and that this damage can lead to irreparable lesions to the mitochondrial genome (1Outten C.E. Culotta V.C. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2015-2024Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 2Strand M.K. Stuart G.R. Longley M.J. Graziewicz M.A. Dominick O.C. Copeland W.C. Eukaryot. Cell. 2003; 2: 809-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In the cytosol, NADP is used by pentose phosphate pathway enzymes glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase Zwf1 and 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase Gnd1 and -2 to produce ribulose-5-phosphate and NADPH (3Grabowska D. Chelstowska A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13984-13988Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The yeast glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase mutant zwf1 is consequently sensitive to oxidizing agents that deplete cytosolic pools of reduced glutathione and thioredoxin, which depend on cytosolic NADPH (4Nogae I. Johnston M. Gene (Amst.). 1990; 96: 161-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 5Slekar K.H. Kosman D.J. Culotta V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28831-28836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). In addition, the zwf1 mutant requires sulfur to be supplied in organic form (6Thomas D. Cherest H. Surdin-Kerjan Y. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 547-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Beyond the requirement of Zwf1 and Gnd1 and -2 for NADP, cytosolic NADP is required by NADP-specific isocitrate dehydrogenase Ipd2, glutamate dehydrogenase Gdh1, and aldehyde dehydrogenase Ald6 (7Butcher R.A. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 7868-7873Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Thus, a cytosolic NAD kinase mutant would be expected to produce pleiotropic phenotypes consistent with deficiencies in multiple enzymes. In yeast, Utr1 was originally reported as a transcript of unknown function (8Barry K. Stiles J.I. Pietras D.F. Melnick L. Sherman F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 632-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) and then shown to encode a component of ferrireductase (9Lesuisse E. Casteras-Simon M. Labbe P. J. Biol.

FEBS J. 2005; 272: 3337-3349Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) consistent with the function of Utr1 within ferrireductase (9Lesuisse E. Casteras-Simon M. Labbe P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13578-13583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), a more general phenotype has not been reported. In many eukaryotes, NAD is synthesized from a de novo pathway from tryptophan (12Krehl W.A. Trepley L.J. Sarma P.S. Elvehjem C.A. Science. 1945; 101: 489-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 13Schutz G. Feigelson P. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 5327-5332Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), an import pathway from nicotinic acid (14Preiss J. Handler P. J. Biol.

Chem. 1958; 233: 493-500Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and a salvage pathway from nicotinamide riboside (16Bieganowski P. Brenner C. Cell. 2004; 117: 495-502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). NAD is not only a co-enzyme for enzymes such as inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase, which use NAD as a hydride acceptor, producing NADH (17Kerr K.M. Digits J.A. Kuperwasser N. Hedstrom L. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9804-9810Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), but also a substrate of NAD glycohydrolases. Although NAD glycohydrolases were once considered mysterious enzymes that cleave NAD to a nicotinamide and an ADP-ribosyl product for no obvious reason (18Maayan M.L. Nature. 1964; 204: 1169-1170Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar), we now understand that a class of protein lysine deacetylases related to yeast Sir2 (Sirtuins) (19Imai S. Armstrong C.M.

Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 1550-1564Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar) are NAD-dependent enzymes. Because these enzymes convert copious amounts of NAD to nicotinamide, organisms benefit from enzymes that salvage nicotinamide to either nicotinic acid or nicotinamide mononucleotide for reentry into NAD biosynthetic pathways. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that the former enzyme, nicotinamidase, found in fungi (23Ghislain M. Talla E. Francois J.M. Yeast. 2002; 19: 215-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), and the latter enzyme, nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase, found in vertebrates (24Rongvaux A. Shea R.J. Mulks M.H. Gigot D. Urbain J. Leo O. Andris F. Eur. J. Immunol. 2002; 32: 3225-3234Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar), entered eukaryotic lineages via horizontal gene transfer. 2F. Gazzaniga and C. Brenner, submitted for publication. The final steps in eukaryotic NAD synthesis are catalyzed either by glutamine-dependent NAD synthetase (26Bieganowski P. Pace H.C. Brenner C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33049-33055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) for the de novo nicotinic acid import and nicotinic acid salvage pathways that go through nicotinic acid mononucleotide (NaMN) or by nicotinic acid mononuleotide/NMN adenylyltransferase (27Emanuelli M. Amici A. Carnevali F. Pierella F. Raffaelli N. Magni G. Protein Expression Purif. 2003; 27: 357-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) for the nicotinamide riboside kinase and nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase pathways that go through an NMN intermediate. In the nucleus and cytosol, NAD-dependent hydride transfer enzymes such as inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase, alcohol dehydrogenase, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase reduce NAD to NADH. NADH is imported into mitochondria by the voltage-dependent anion channel (porin isoform 1) (28Colombini M. Nature. 1979; 279: 643-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar, 29Benz R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1197: 167-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar) and possibly by the translocase of the outer membrane complex (30Kmita H. Budzinska M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1509: 86-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). NAD is imported into mitochondria by the products of the YIA6 (NDT1) and YEA6 (NDT2) genes, which have essentially no transport activity on NADP or NADPH (31Todisco S. Agrimi G. Castegna A. Palmieri F. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 1524-1531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Thus, unless NADP or NADPH is imported into mitochondria by a process that has not been described, mitochondrial NADP and NADPH should depend entirely on a mitochondrial NAD/NADH kinase activity. Similarly, unless NADP or NADPH can flow back from mitochondria to the cytosol, cytosolic NADP and NADPH are expected to depend on a cytosolic NAD/NADH kinase or mislocalization of the corresponding mitochondrial enzyme. Because two of three NAD/NADH kinase genes had been analyzed with respect to phenotypes and biochemical characteristics, we wished to perform a genetic and biochemical analysis of the remaining NAD/NADH kinase gene in yeast and to analyze phenotypes of double and triple mutants. Recently, Shi et al. (11Shi F. Kawai S. Mori S. Kono E. Murata K. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 3337-3349Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) purified the third yeast NAD/NADH kinase, Yef1, and concluded, as we do, that Yef1 is a cytosolic NAD kinase. However, they claim to produce viable cells deleted for pos5, utr1, and yef1 and suggested the existence of an additional NAD kinase unrelated to the sequence of NAD/NADH kinases (11Shi F. Kawai S. Mori S. Kono E. Murata K. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 3337-3349Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In contrast, we report that pos5 utr1 is a synthetic lethal combination, with or without the deletion of yef1. Our analysis confirms that pos5 mutants have mitochondrial (i.e. respiratory) defects (1Outten C.E. Culotta V.C. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2015-2024Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 2Strand M.K. Stuart G.R. Longley M.J. Graziewicz M.A. Dominick O.C. Copeland W.C. Eukaryot. Cell. 2003; 2: 809-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) and establishes that Utr1 has cytoplasmic (i.e. fermentative) defects, indicating that neither enzyme is significantly mislocalized and that triphosphopyridine nucleotides do not exchange between nucleocytoplasmic and mitochondrial compartments. We also demonstrate that pos5 and utr1 produce a synthetic lethal combination. Moreover, our analysis shows that Yef1, encoded by the YEL041W gene, is a low specific activity NAD kinase. Although the deletion of the yef1 gene did not exacerbate either the pos5 or the utr1 phenotypes, the pos5 utr1 double mutant was synthetically lethal, indicating that there is not enough NADP produced by Yef1 to support the fermentation that must occur in pos5 mutants. Finally, although the pos5 utr1 mutant is inviable, we find that rho–utr1 mutants are viable, suggesting that the viability of utr1 mutants depends on cytosolic Pos5 NAD/NADH kinase activity prior to or during the transport of this molecule to the mitochondrion. Enzyme Expression and Purification—Expression plasmids were designed for purification of His-tagged versions of Utr1 and Yef1 from Escherichia coli. Primer sequences are provided in Supplementary Table 1. The UTR1 open reading frame was amplified from Saccharomyces cerevisiae genomic DNA with primers 7125 and 7126 and cloned into vector pMR103 (32Munson M. Predki P.F. Regan L.

An N-terminal His tag was added by annealing oligonucleotides 7300 and 7301 and ligating to NcoI-digested plasmid pB414 to produce plasmid pB421. The YEF1 coding sequence was amplified with primers 7318 and 7319, digested with NdeI and BglII, and cloned into vector pSGA04 (33Ghosh S. Lowenstein J.M. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 176: 249-255Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar) cleaved with NdeI and BamHI to create plasmid pB430. E. coli BL21 cells transformed with either plasmid pB421 or pB430 were used to express the His-tagged NAD kinases. Bacterial cells were lysed by sonication in Buffer A (20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8, 100 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10 mm imidazole and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)). Clarified lysates were loaded on cobalt chelate affinity columns. Columns were washed with 15 volumes of Buffer A, and enzymes were eluted with Buffer A supplemented with 100 mm imidazole. Purified enzymes were concentrated and dialyzed against Buffer A without imidazole. Enzymatic Assays—To determine the specific activities of the Utr1 and Yef1 kinases, 100-μl pre-mixes containing 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.1, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm NTP or dNTP, and 1 mm NAD, NADH, or NaAD were incubated with either Utr1 or Yef1 enzyme (0–5 μg) for 20 min at 37 °C. EDTA (10 μl of 0.5 m) was added to stop the reactions, and NADP, NADPH, or NaADP products were separated and quantified by high pressure liquid chromatography using a strong anion exchange column in a 10–750 mm gradient of sodium phosphate, pH 2.6. Mean specific activities of three separate experiments, expressed as μmol of NADP, NADPH, or NaADP min−1 mg−1, were calculated from reactions in which no more than 10% of substrates were converted into products. Yeast Strains—DNA fragments for disruption of UTR1, POS5, and YEF1 genes were constructed as described (34Brachmann C.B. Davies A. Cost G.J. Caputo E. Li J. Hieter P. Boeke J.D. Yeast. 1998; 14: 115-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (2646) Google Scholar). For UTR1, primers 7127 and 7128 were used to amplify the HIS3 marker of plasmid pRS413 (35Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Correct integration of HIS3 at the UTR1 locus was verified by PCR using primers 7125 and 7126. For POS5, primers 7343 and 7345 were used to amplify the Geneticin resistance marker of plasmid pRS401 (35Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Correct integration was verified with primers 7342 and 7344. For YEF1, primers 7312 and 7313 were used to amplify the TRP1 marker of plasmid pRS414 (35Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Correct integration was verified with primers 7314 and 7315. Diploid yeast strain SEY6210.5 was subjected to three consecutive steps of gene replacement and verification using these disruption cassettes. The resulting strain, BY274, triply heterozygous for the deletion of pos5, utr1, and yef1, was incubated on sporulation medium. Following tetrad formation, spores were separated by micromanipulation, and the genotypes of the resulting haploid isolates were tested by growth on appropriate selective media (see Table 1). UTR1, YEF1, and POS5 were amplified from the S. cerevisiae genome using primers 776 and 777, 778 and 779, and 780 and 781, respectively. The UTR1 gene PCR product and plasmid pRS416 (35Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were digested with EcoRI and SpeI and ligated to produce pB534. The YEF1 open reading frame PCR product was similarly digested and ligated into p416ADH1 (36Mumberg D. Muller R. Funk M. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 156: 119-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (1603) Google Scholar) to produce pB535. The POS5 gene PCR product and pRS416 were digested with BamHI and XhoI and ligated to produce pB532. Diploid strain BY274 heterozygous for pos5, utr1, and yef1 disruption was transformed with pB532, pB534, and pB535 and, after sporulation and tetrad dissection, haploids were isolated with each plasmid present in each combination of NAD/NADH kinase gene disruption. Strains were then plated on 5-fluororotic acid media to recover and characterize viable haploid genotypes. Media used to grow yeast cultures and protocols for transformations and tetrad dissection have been described (37Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K.

Sequence analysis of YEF1 (YEL041W) indicates the presence of an NAD kinase signature (39Raffaelli N. Finaurini L. Mazzola F. Pucci L. Sorci L. Amici A. Magni G.

As shown in Fig. 2, at the level of primary sequence, Yef1 is more similar to the NAD kinase Utr1 than to NADH kinase Pos5. To compare their biochemical activities, we purified Utr1 and Yef1 proteins expressed in E. coli as N-terminally His-tagged fusions. Because yeast NAD kinase is a relatively unstable enzyme (44Apps D.K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1970; 13: 223-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), our rapid, one-step purification produced higher specific activities than those previously reported (10Kawai S. Suzuki S.

Utr1 phosphorylates NADH with ∼2% of the specific activity of its NAD kinase activity, preferring ATP as the phosphoryl donor for formation of NADPH. The maximal activity for Yef1 is with NAD and ATP, although it possesses ∼33% of this activity with NADH and ATP. In terms of NAD-ATP kinase activity, Yef1 exhibits only about 6% of the specific activity of Utr1. However, with the low activity of Utr1 on NADH and the relative nonspecificity of Yef1 for phosphoacceptors, Yef1 has about as much NADH kinase specific activity as does Utr1. To test whether either NAD kinase might have a role in formation of the calcium-mobilizing second messenger, NaADP (46Rutter G.A. Biochem. J. 2003; 373: e3-e4Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we examined Utr1 and Yef1 as ATP-dependent NaAD kinases (Table 1). The specific activity of Utr1 was 0.4 ± 0.01 μmol NaADP min−1 mg−1, and that of Yef1 was 0.5 ± 0.02 μmol NaADP min−1 mg−1. These values represent less than 1% of the specific activity of Utr1 as an ATP-dependent NAD kinase. Enzyme activity in vivo is a function of enzyme localization, enzyme concentration, and intrinsic activity. Global analysis of protein expression indicates that Yef1 is expressed at a level of only about 300 molecules per cell, as compared with ∼5000 molecules of Utr1 and Pos5 (47Ghaemmaghami S. Huh W.K. Bower K. Howson R.W. Belle A. Dephoure N. O'Shea E.K. Weissman J.S. Nature. 2003; 425: 737-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (3008) Google Scholar). Thus, with the important caveat that our recombinant preparations might have missed a factor that contributes to the activity of Utr1 or Yef1 in vivo, our data suggest that Yef1 contributes very slightly to total NAD and NADH kinase activities in vivo. To determine the roles of NAD and NADH kinase genes in living cells, we created diploid yeast strain BY274 with confirmed heterozygous deletions of the POS5, UTR1, and YEF1 genes. Following sporulation and dissection, the resulting haploids were analyzed. As shown in Table 2, of the eight possible genotypes that could potentially be recovered from the triheterozygous diploid, we recovered six genotypes 10–19 times. No strain was recovered with utr1 and pos5 deleted or with all three genes deleted. Synthetic lethality of utr1 and pos5 has not been reported previously. Because UTR1 and POS5 are not genetically linked, the nonrecovery of the double mutant is the first indication that either genetic loss renders the second gene to be essential.TABLE 2Synthetic lethality of utr1 and pos5GenotypeNumber of independent isolatesPOS5 UTR1 YEF114pos5 UTR1 YEF116POS5 utr1 YEF112POS5 UTR1 yef115pos5 UTR1 yef110POS5 utr1 yef119pos5 utr1 YEF10pos5 utr1 yef10 Open table in a new tab To further characterize the viability and growth characteristics of NAD/NADH kinase deletion mutants, strain BY274 was transformed with pB532 (POS5), pB534 (UTR1), or pB535 (ADH1 promoter driving YEF1), and haploids containing each of these plasmids in the triple delete background were recovered. Although the pos5 utr1 double mutant and the pos5 utr1 yef1 triple mutant could not be recovered by simple dissection of strain BY274 or BY274 carrying the empty vector pRS416, we recovered both of these genotypes in the presence of each of the NAD/NADH kinase plasmids, pB532, pB534, and pB535. Although pB532 and pB534 transformants would be expected to confer a viable utr1 yef1 phenotype and a pos5 yef1 phenotype to the pos5 utr1 yef1 chromosomal genotype, the viability of pB535 transformants indicates that overexpression of YEF1 suppresses the lethal phenotype of pos5 utr1. As shown in Fig. 3, upon plating each of the transformants on 5-fluororotic acid medium, none of the strains could be recovered as plasmid-free pos5 utr1 yef1 triple mutant strains. Taken together, Table 2 and Fig. 3 indicate that pos5 utr1 and pos5 utr1 yef1 are synthetically lethal mutant combinations that can be suppressed by overexpression of Yef1. Pos5 has been characterized as a mitochondrial NADH kinase that phosphorylates NAD to a lesser extent (1Outten C.E. Culotta V.C. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2015-2024Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 2Strand M.K. Stuart G.R. Longley M.J. Graziewicz M.A. Dominick O.C. Copeland W.C. Eukaryot. Cell. 2003; 2: 809-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), whereas Utr1 has been characterized as a cytoplasmic NAD kinase that phosphorylates NADH to a lesser extent (10Kawai S. Suzuki S. Mori S. Murata K. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2001; 200: 181-184Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mutants within these genes display distinct phenotypes. Mutants lacking Pos5 exhibit a near normal rate of growth on glucose (Fig. 4, A and C) but are unable to grow on nonfermentable carbon sources, such as glycerol (Fig. 4B). Since NADPH is used as a cofactor by enzymes involved in the detoxification of peroxide, superoxide, and hydroxyl radicals that are generated in mitochondria (48Kirkman H.N. Gaetani G.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 4343-4347Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar, 49Holmgren A. Bjornstedt M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 252: 199-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar, 50Tamura T. McMicken H.W. Smith C.V. Hansen T.N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 237: 419-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), depletion of the mitochondrial NADPH pool would be expected to lead to an increased level of oxidative damage to mitochondrial proteins and DNA, consistent with the mitochondrial genome instability that results from pos5 mutation (2Strand M.K. Stuart G.R. Longley M.J. Graziewicz M.A. Dominick O.C. Copeland W.C. Eukaryot. Cell. 2003; 2: 809-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In contrast to the respiratory incompetence of pos5 mutants, utr1 mutants displayed wild-type growth on glycerol (Fig. 4B) and slow growth on glucose (Fig. 4, A and C). As shown in Fig. 4, growth of yef1 mutant strains on glucose and glycerol was indistinguishable from that of wild-type strains. Unlike mutants in glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase that are deficient in NADP, yef1 mutants exhibited no increased sensitivity to methyl viologen and H2O2 (4Nogae I. Johnston M. Gene (Amst.). 1990; 96: 161-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 5Slekar K.H. Kosman D.J. Culotta V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28831-28836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) and did not exhibit methionine and/or cysteine auxotrophy (6Thomas D. Cherest H. Surdin-Kerjan Y. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 547-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The double mutants, pos5 yef1 and utr1 yef1, did not demonstrate any additional growth defects on glucose or glycerol, relative to single pos5 and utr1 mutants. Similarly, yef1 deletion did not enhance reactive oxygen sensitivity or auxotrophic requirements of pos5 or utr1 (data not shown). These results indicate that the Yef1 protein does not have a major role in production of triphosphopyridine nucleotides in vivo. Based on the synthetic lethality of utr1 and pos5, it is apparent that Yef1 activity under its own promoter is insufficient to support the UTR1 requirement of pos5 mutants or the POS5 requirement of utr1 mutants. These experiments established three facts that could be interpreted through at least two mutually exclusive mechanisms. First, a cell cannot live if it is devoid of the mitochondrial NAD/NADH kinase Pos5 and the cytosolic NAD/NADH kinase Utr1. Second, ADH1-driven Yef1 suppresses the Pos5 dependence of utr1 mutants. Third, ADH1-driven Yef1 suppresses the Utr1 dependence of pos5 mutants. The most distinctive explanations for these facts are that 1) the poorly fermenting utr1 mutant is totally dependent on Pos5-dependent respiration or some specific mitochondrial function of Pos5 or 2) the poorly fermenting utr1 mutant is dependent on at least transient cytosolic NADP/NADPH production by Pos5. Based on experiments with plasmid-borne copies of POS5, UTR1, and YEF1 in pos5 and utr1 backgrounds and experiments in which rho–derivatives of utr1 were prepared and characterized, we were able to eliminate the first mechanism and gather evidence for the second. Plasmid pB535, encoding YEF1 driven by the ADH1 promoter, has the property of an overexpression-based suppressor of one phenotype of pos5, namely synthetic lethality with utr1. To test whether plasmid-borne copies of POS5, UTR1, or YEF1 would suppress specific mitochondrial phenotypes of pos5, we tested BY274-derived haploids of genotype pos5 UTR1 YEF1 carrying pB532, pB534, and pB535 for growth on a nonfermentable carbon source and arginine prototrophy. As reported earlier (1Outten C.E. Culotta V.C. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2015-2024Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), the pos5 mutant is arginine auxotrophic, due to lack of NADPH needed for the NADPH-dependent step of arginine biosynthesis catalyzed by mitochondrial N-acetyl-γ-glutamylphosphate reductase (25Jauniaux J.C. Urrestarazu L.A. Wiame J.M. J. Bacteriol. 1978; 133: 1096-1107Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5, the glycerol and arg− phenotypes of pos5 were only rescued by POS5 expression and not by plasmid-borne copies of UTR1 or YEF1. Because the ADH1-driven YEF1 construct allows a pos5 deletion strain to survive utr1 disruption but does not improve its respiratory or mitochondrial function, the mechanism of ADH1-driven YEF1 as a suppressor of synthetic lethality with utr1 appears to be production of cytoplasmic rather than mitochondrial NADP/NADPH. As shown in Fig. 4, pos5 mutants are incapable of growth on glycerol, whereas utr1 mutants have a slow growth phenotype on glucose, and pos5 mutants have a modest slow growth phenotype. To test whether the slow growth phenotypes of pos5 or utr1 might be suppressed by any of the NAD/NADH kinase genes, we compared the growth of pos5 and utr1 haploid isolates carrying empty vector pRS416 with those carrying plasmids pB532, pB534, and pB535. As shown in Fig. 6A, normal growth of a pos5 strain can be restored by a plasmid-borne copy of POS5 but not by either of the genes encoding cytosolic NAD/NADH kinases. In contrast, as shown in Fig. 6B, the slow growth phenotype of utr1 can be fully reversed by plasmid-borne UTR1 and by ADH1-driven YEF1 and can be improved by plasmid expression of POS5. Thus, although expression of cytosolic NAD/NADH kinases have no effect on the phenotype of the mitochondrial NAD/NADH kinase mutant, expression of mitochondrial NAD/NADH kinase appears to reduce the phenotype of a deficiency in cytosolic NADP/NADPH. Because ADH1-driven YEF1 suppresses the pos5 dependence on UTR1 without restoring the mitochondrial function to pos5, we considered the possibility that utr1 is not synthetically lethal with the respiratory defect of pos5 but rather with the lack of at least a transient exposure of the Pos5 active site to the cytosol. As a test of this hypothesis, we set out to obtain rho–derivatives of utr1 by growing cells overnight in YPD medium containing 10 μg/ml ethidium bromide and streaking the resulting cells on glucose medium (38Slonimski P.P. Perrodin G. Croft J.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1968; 30: 232-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 7, such mutants were easily obtained and proved to be respiration-incompetent by failure to grow on glycerol medium. However, as judged by plate assays, the rho–utr1 mutants grown on glucose possessed the same growth rate as rho+ utr1 mutants. Because there is not a respiratory component to the growth of utr1 mutants but utr1 mutants depend on POS5, we conclude that the viability of utr1 mutants depends on cytosolic Pos5 enzymatic activity expressed during Pos5 transit to the mitochondria. In conclusion, Utr1 is responsible for essentially all of the NAD/NADH kinase activity resident in the cytoplasm, whereas Pos5 is responsible for all mitochondrial NAD/NADH kinase activity and consequent mitochondrial genome maintenance. Yef1 can substitute for Utr1 when overexpressed. Because utr1 is synthetically lethal with pos5 but not with loss of respiration, the data indicate that transitory exposure of Pos5 to the cytoplasm is required for the viability of utr1 mutants.

https://openalex.org/W2059420020,"Tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) is a potent pleiotropic cytokine produced by many cells in response to inflammatory stress. The molecular mechanisms responsible for the multiple biological activities of TNFα are due to its ability to activate multiple signal transduction pathways, including nuclear factor κB (NFκB), which plays critical roles in cell proliferation and survival. TNFα displays both apoptotic and antiapoptotic properties, depending on the nature of the stimulus and the activation status of certain signaling pathways. Here we show that TNFα can lead to the induction of NFκB signaling with a concomitant increase in spermidine/spermine N1-acetyltransferase (SSAT) expression in A549 and H157 non-small cell lung cancer cells. Induction of SSAT, a stress-inducible gene that encodes a rate-limiting polyamine catabolic enzyme, leads to lower intracellular polyamine contents and has been associated with decreased cell growth and increased apoptosis. Stable overexpression of a mutant, dominant negative IκBα protein led to the suppression of SSAT induction by TNFα in these cells, thereby substantiating a role of NFκB in the induction of SSAT by TNFα. SSAT promoter deletion constructs led to the identification of three potential NFκB response elements in the SSAT gene. Electromobility shift assays, chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments and mutational studies confirmed that two of the three NFκB response elements play an important role in the regulation of SSAT in response to TNFα. The results of these studies indicate that a common mediator of inflammation can lead to the induction of SSAT expression by activating the NFκB signaling pathway in non-small cell lung cancer cells.

Therefore, although polyamines are required for cell growth and differentiation, SSAT is thought to prevent overaccumulation of the higher polyamines from becoming toxic to the cell and may play a role in reducing the growth rate by decreasing intracellular polyamines. Recently, considerable attention has been paid to SSAT as a target for cancer chemotherapy. SSAT activity is highly regulated and is induced rapidly in response to a number of stimuli, including polyamines, polyamine analogues, hormones, physiological stimuli, drugs, and toxic agents (1Casero Jr., R.A. Pegg A.E. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 653-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). It has been shown that the regulation of SSAT by the natural polyamines and the anti-tumor polyamine analogues is through the polyamine response element (7Wang Y. Xiao L. Thiagalingam A. Nelkin B.D.

Further, the superinduction of SSAT by polyamine analogues has been implicated in the cell type-specific cytotoxic response of several important human tumors (8Casero Jr., R.A. Celano P. Ervin S.J.

Various nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs like aspirin, sulindac, and indomethacin and chemotherapy drugs like 5-flurouracil and oxaliplatin have been shown to induce SSAT expression in various cancer cell types (14Hector S.

Sulindac induces SSAT by inducing peroxisomal proliferator-activated receptors, which, once activated, can bind to the peroxisomal proliferator-activated receptor response elements in the SSAT 5′ promoter region (18Babbar N. Ignatenko N.A. Casero Jr., R.A. Gerner E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47762-47775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Recently, we have shown that aspirin can also induce SSAT expression in colon cancer cells, partly by activating the NFκB signaling pathway, which leads to the binding of NFκB complexes to the NFκB response elements in the SSAT 5′ promoter region (19Babbar N. Gerner E.W. Casero Jr., R.A. Biochem. J. 2005; Google Scholar). Tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) is a potent pleiotropic cytokine and is a major mediator of inflammation with multiple biological functions (20Beutler B.A. J. Rheumatol. Suppl. 1999; 57: 16-21PubMed Google Scholar). One of the molecular mechanisms responsible for the biological activities of TNFα is the ability to activate nuclear factor κB (NFκB), which plays critical roles in cell proliferation and survival (21Chang L. Karin M. Nature. 2001; 410: 37-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (4359) Google Scholar, 22Baldwin Jr., A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (5553) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, five members of the NFκB/Rel family are known: NFκB1 (p50 or its precursor p105), NFκB2 (p52 or its precursor p100), c-Rel, RelA (p65), and RelB (23Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore D. Cell. 1996; 87: 13-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2919) Google Scholar, 24Baud V. Karin M. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 372-377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1369) Google Scholar). Heterodimers composed of p65-p50 are the most abundant active form of NFκB in most cell types. However, NFκB can consist of other homo- and heterodimers that have different abilities to activate target genes (25Attar R.M. Caamano J. Carrasco D. Iotsova V. Ishikawa H. Ryseck R.P. Weih F. Bravo R. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1997; 8: 93-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 26Kopp E.B. Ghosh S. Adv. Immunol. 1995; 58: 1-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). In quiescent cells, NFκB resides in the cytosol in a latent form bound to IκBα. Stimulation of the cell with TNFα triggers a series of signaling events that ultimately leads to the phosphorylation and the proteolytic degradation of IκBα and activation of NFκB. The phosphorylation of IκBα is elicited by an IκBα kinase (IKK), which can be activated by mitogen-activated protein kinase (27Schulze-Osthoff K. Ferrari D. Riehemann K. Wesselborg S. Immunobiology. 1997; 198: 35-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar, 28Zhao Q. Lee F.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8355-8358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar), whereas the proteolysis of IκBα is mediated by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway of protein degradation. The degradation of IκBα triggers the translocation of NFκB from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, where it regulates the expression of multiple genes. In this study, we examined the effects of TNFα treatment on SSAT expression in representative human non-small cell lung cancer cells and identified the specific NFκB response elements responsible for the regulation of SSAT by TNFα. Materials—All cell culture reagents, DNA-modifying enzymes, TRIzol® reagent (total RNA isolation reagent), and Lipofectamine reagent were purchased from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA). All primers and oligonucleotides were custom made by Invitrogen. Recombinant human TNFα was obtained from R&D Systems, Inc. (Minneapolis, MN). IκBα antibody is from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA), and p65 antibody is from Upstate (Waltham, MA). Paclitaxel (Taxol®) was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Cell Culture—The non-small cell cancer lines NCI-A549 (adenocarcinoma) and NCI-H157 (squamous) were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% (v/v) bovine calf serum and 100 units/ml each of penicillin and streptomycin. Cultures were maintained at 37 °C in humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. Plasmids—Full-SSAT-luc, having a 3.493-kb-long 5′-flanking sequence of the human SSAT gene, was cloned into a promoterless pGL2-basic (Promega, Madison, WI) as previously reported (29Xiao L. Celano P. Mank A.R. Griffin C. Jabs E.W. Hawkins A.L. Casero Jr., R.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 187: 1493-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). A series of smaller SSAT promoter constructs were made from Full-SSAT-luc, using PCR and subcloned into pGL2-basic vector. 197-SSAT-luc, having 283 nucleotides of the 5′-flanking region of the SSAT promoter; 358-SSAT-luc, having 441 nucleotides of the 5′-flanking region of the SSAT promoter; and 659-SSAT-luc, having 740 nucleotides of the 5′-flanking region of the SSAT promoter, were made from Full-SSAT-luc using PCR and subcloned into pGL2-basic vector. NFκB2-Luc reporter, having two NFκB response elements; dNFκB2-Luc reporter, in which both the NFκB response elements have been deleted; and dominant negative-IκBα (DN/IκB) and its control (Ctrl/IκB) plasmids were obtained from Dr. Nancy Davidson (Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD). The DN/IκB plasmid has a deletion of 36 NH2-terminal amino acids containing Ser32 and Ser36 phosphorylation sites, which was cloned into the pcDNA3.1 mammalian expression plasmid vector (Invitrogen). mNFκB1-SSAT-luc, mNFκB3-SSAT-luc, and dmNFκB1/3-SSAT-luc were made by mutating the NFκB-1, NFκB-3, and both the NFκB-1 and -3 sites, respectively, in the Full-SSAT-luc using the QuikChange® site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Mutations were done by placing four base substitutions in the respective NFκB sites to achieve the same mutated sequences as the probes used for the electromobility shift assays. Stable Transfection—Exponentially growing cells were plated at 1 × 106 cells/100-mm plate and cultured in normal medium for 24 h and then transfected using 50 μl of Lipofectamine reagent with 10 μg of the DNA plasmid. After 6 h of incubation, with Lipofectamine-DNA complex, cells were supplemented with complete medium having 20% bovine calf serum and 2% penicillin and streptomycin and grown overnight, after which the medium was removed, cells were refed complete medium, and cells were allowed to recover for 24 h prior to selection in 0.4 mg/ml G418. Cells were maintained in selection medium until a stable population was achieved. Individual colonies were then isolated, expanded, and used for screening and experiments. Transient Transfections—Transient transfections were performed using Lipofectamine reagent according to the supplied protocol. Briefly, 5 × 105 cells were seeded in a 6-well plate and cultured in normal medium for 24 h. Cells in each well were transfected with 1 μg of firefly luciferase reporter construct along with 0.2 μg of pCMV-β-galalactosidase expression plasmid, used as a control for transfectional efficiency. After 6 h, cells were supplemented with complete medium having 20% bovine calf serum and 2% penicillin and streptomycin and grown overnight. 15 h later, the medium was removed, and cells were refed with the medium containing 10 ng/ml TNFα for the indicated amount of time. All transfections were performed in triplicates unless otherwise indicated. Transfected cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed, and luciferase activities were measured using 10 μl of cell extract and 50 μl of luciferase reagent (Promega). β-Galactosidase activity was measured using the β-galalactosidase assay kit (Invitrogen) according to the supplied protocol. Quantitative Real Time PCR—Cells were seeded, grown overnight, and then treated as indicated. Total cellular RNA was extracted using TRIzol® reagent and RNA isolation according to the method developed by Chomczynski and Sacchi (30Chromczynski P.S.N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63088) Google Scholar). 3 μg of total RNA was treated with RNase-free DNase I (Roche Applied Science) for 30 min at 37 °C before reverse transcription with Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Promega, Madison, WI) as described by the manufacturer. The forward and reverse primers were used at 10 μm. The resulting cDNA was subjected to quantitative real time PCR. The DNA-intercalating SyBr green reagent (Quantitect; Qiagen) and melting temperature profiles were used for detection of the PCR product. Agarose gel electrophoresis confirmed the presence of a single PCR product. The glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was used as an internal standard. The experimental and GAPDH PCRs were done in separate tubes in triplicates in the MyiQ single color real-time PCR machine (Bio-Rad), and the average threshold cycle (CT) for the triplicate was used in subsequent calculations. SSAT cDNA (180 base pairs) was amplified using the following primers (Invitrogen): forward, 5′-GGATCAAAATTCTGAAGAAT-3′; reverse, 5′-ACCCTCTTCACTGGACAGATC-3′. As a loading control, GAPDH cDNA (188 base pairs) was also amplified using the following primers: forward, 5′-GAAGGTGAAGGTCGGAGTC-3′; reverse, 5′-GAAGATGGTGATGGGATTTC-3′. Immunoblotting—Total cell extracts were obtained by lysing cells on ice in radioimmune precipitation buffer (phosphate-buffered saline, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 30 μg/ml aprotinin, 100 μm sodium orthovanadate, 10 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and centrifuging for 20 min at 4 °C. 30 μg of total protein was loaded per lane and separated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels for IκBα immunoblotting. Nuclear protein was isolated, using the NE-PER nuclear extraction reagents (Pierce). 50 μg of nuclear protein was loaded per lane and separated on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels for p65 immunoblot. The proteins were transferred electrophoretically to immunoblot polyvinylidene difluoride membrane for 1 h. Blots were blocked in Blotto A (5% w/v nonfat dry milk in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 137 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) and probed for IκBα and p65 proteins. Blots were stripped and redetected with β-actin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) antibody as a loading control. Western blot analyses were repeated at least three times, and a representative blot was chosen for presentation. In Taxol experiments, Western blot results were quantified using the LICOR immunofluorescence system (LI-COR Biosciences, Lincoln, NE). Briefly, membranes were blocked for 1 h in Odyssey blocking buffer, per the manufacturer's instructions. Rabbit anti-IκBα and mouse anti-actin (loading control) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) primary antibodies were then added together at dilutions of 1:1000 and 1:1500, respectively, with 0.1% Tween 20 in blocking buffer for 1 h at room temperature. Following washes with PBS-Tween, blots were incubated with appropriate fluorescent dye-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:4000 each, 0.1% Tween 20, in blocking buffer, protected from light, for 45 min), which allowed detection and quantification of each protein using an Odyssey infrared detection system and software (LI-COR). Gel Electromobility Shift Assays—Nuclear extracts were prepared from A549 cells as described previously (31Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9150) Google Scholar). To study the binding of NFκB complexes to the putative NFκB sites, double-stranded oligonucleotides for each of the three putative NFκB sites in the SSAT 5′ sequence were 32P-labeled with polynucleotide kinase (Promega, Madison, WI). The oligonucleotide containing the first putative NFκB site spanned from –304 to –280 of the SSAT 5′ sequence and had the sequence NFκB-wild-1 (w) (5′-GCTGCAGAGGGAATTACCTTCTTT-3′), whereas the corresponding mutant NFκB-mut-1 (m) had the sequence 5′-GCTGCAGAtaGAATgcCCTTCTTT-3′. The oligonucleotide spanning the third putative NFκB site spanned from –1751 to –1728 of the SSAT 5′ sequence and had the sequence NFκB-wild-3 (w3) (5′-CCTAGGGGGATTCCACGGATCCT-3′, whereas the corresponding mutant NFκB-mut-3 (m3) had the sequence 5′-CCTAGGtGATTCagCGGATCCT-3′. The putative NFκB sequence is underlined, and the mutated bases are shown in lowercase letters. A 10-μl reaction containing 10 μg of nuclear extract was incubated for 15 min at room temperature in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm EDTA, 250 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm dithiothreitol, 20% glycerol, and 1 μg of poly(dI-dC). Following this, 30,000 cpm of the labeled probe was added, and the reaction mixture was incubated for 30 min at room temperature. The DNA-protein complexes were resolved from the free probe by electrophoresis at 4 °C on a 5% polyacrylamide gel in 0.75× TBE buffer, pH 8. Band density was quantified using the Typhoon 8600 PhosphorImager and ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP)—Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays were performed using the commercially available ChIP kit (Upstate Cell Signaling) with some modifications. A549 cells were seeded at 2 × 106/culture dish and grown overnight. On the following day, they were treated with 10 ng/ml TNFα for increasing times. After treatment, the cells were treated with 1% formaldehyde by adding 0.4 ml of 37% formaldehyde directly to 15 ml of culture medium for 15 min at 37 °C. The cells were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline containing protease inhibitors (leupeptin, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and aprotinin) and then suspended in 0.7 ml of SDS-lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.1, containing 1% SDS and 10 mm EDTA) plus protease inhibitors. Twenty 10-s sonication pulses with 30-s intervals were done using the Branson Sonifier 250 (cycle 40%, output = 1.5/2) to shear chromatin to <1000-bp fragments. The effectiveness of shearing was confirmed by incubating a 100-μl aliquot of the extract with 10 μl of 5 m NaCl at 65 °C for 4 h (to reverse cross-links) and subsequently subjecting it to electrophoresis on a 1% agarose gel. The sonicated sample was centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 10 min. 0.2 ml of the cell supernatant was diluted by adding 1.8 ml of ChIP dilution buffer (16.7 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.1, containing 0.01% SDS, 1.1% Triton X-100, 167 mm NaCl, and 1.2 mm EDTA) plus protease inhibitors. 50 μl of this sample was stored for later PCR analysis as the input sample control. To reduce nonspecific background, the remaining amount (1950 μl) was precleared with 75 μl of salmon sperm DNA/protein-agarose 50% slurry (Upstate Cell Signaling, NY) for 1 h at 4°C with agitation. The cleared supernatant was divided into 0.4-ml aliquots and incubated with either no antibody, a nonspecific antibody (rabbit IgG), 4 μl of anti-p50, or 4 μl of anti-p65 and incubated overnight at 4 °C with rotation, followed by the addition of 30 μl of salmon sperm DNA/protein-agarose 50% slurry and incubated for an additional 3 h. The agarose was pelleted by centrifugation, and the pellets were washed consecutively with 0.5 ml of low salt buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.1, containing 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, and 2 mm EDTA), 0.5 ml of high salt buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.1, containing 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 500 mm NaCl, and 2 mm EDTA), 0.5 ml of LiCl wash buffer (10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.1, containing 0.25 m LiCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% deoxycholate, and 1 mm EDTA), and 0.5 ml of 1× Tris/EDTA (10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.1 containing 1 mm EDTA). DNA and protein were eluted from the pellets by incubating the pellets twice in 0.25 ml of elution buffer (0.1 m NaHCO3 with 1% SDS), and protein-DNA cross-links were reversed by incubating with 20 μl of 5 m NaCl at 65 °C for 4 h. Proteins were then degraded by incubating the eluant with 10 μl of 0.5 m EDTA, 20 μl of 1 m Tris-Cl, pH 6.5, and 2 μl of 10 mg/ml Proteinase K for 1 h at 45 °C. DNA was recovered by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol-precipitated overnight at –20 °C. Samples were pelleted, washed with 70% ethanol, and dissolved in 100 μl of sterile water. 2-μl aliquots were used for each PCR to determine binding of either p65 or p50 to the co-immunoprecipitated promoter fragments. The primers used to probe for the NFκB-1 site are forward (5′-TCCTGAGTTGCTTCCCACT-3′) and reverse (5′-GGTGTGTCCCAGTAACAT-3′), primers for the NFκB-2 site are forward (5′-GGGCAGAAGGAAAAGTGTCA-3′) and reverse (5′-CCAAAGGAATGTGAGCTCGT-3′), and primers for the NFκB-3 site are forward (5′-GACCACCCCTCACATTCAAC-3′) and reverse (5′-TGGCAGTTGAGAATCAGTGG-3′). SSAT Enzyme Activity Determination—For enzyme activities, cells were grown overnight and then treated with TNFα for different times. Cells were harvested after treatment and washed in cold phosphate-buffered saline. The radiochemical assay of the N1-SSAT activity was performed by estimation of labeled N1-acetylspermidine synthesized from [14C]acetyl-coenzyme A and unlabeled spermidine, as previously described (8Casero Jr., R.A. Celano P. Ervin S.J. Porter C.W. Bergeron R.J. Libby P.R. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 3829-3833PubMed Google Scholar). Fold change was calculated by dividing the enzyme activity for the sample by the vehicle. The enzyme assays were performed in triplicate. Polyamine Analysis—Cell extracts were prepared in 0.1 n HCl (4 × 107 cells/900 μl). After sonication, the preparation was adjusted to 0.2 n HClO4, and the supernatant was analyzed by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography with 1,7-diaminoheptane as an internal standard (32Kabra P.M. Lee H.K. Lubich W.P. Marton L.J. J. Chromatogr. 1986; 380: 19-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Protein was determined by the BCA assay (33Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18514) Google Scholar). Statistical Analysis—All transient transfection experiments were performed in triplicates and were repeated at least three times. Quantitative real time PCR and ChIP assays were done at least three times. Representative experiments or mean values ± S.D. are shown. Statistical differences were determined by Student's t test. A p value of <0.05 was considered significant. TNFα Induces SSAT mRNA and SSAT Enzyme Activity and Decreases Intracellular Polyamine Contents in Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) Cells—We have previously demonstrated the presence of functional NFκB response elements in the SSAT gene (34Babbar N. Gerner E.W. Casero Jr., R.A. Biochem. J. 2006; 394: 317-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Since SSAT has been implicated as a stress response gene (1Casero Jr., R.A. Pegg A.E. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 653-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar), we sought to determine whether TNFα, acting through NFκB, altered the expression of SSAT in the NSCLC cells. TNFα, at 10 ng/ml, induces SSAT mRNA expression in both A549 and H157 NSCLC cells within 30 min of treatment (Fig. 1A). SSAT is an enzyme that acetylates both spermidine and spermine. The acetylated products can then be either exported or degraded by the action of polyamine oxidase, thereby leading to a decrease in intracellular polyamine content. Therefore, we next determined whether the increase in SSAT mRNA by TNFα treatment was accompanied by an increase in SSAT enzyme activity and a decrease in the polyamine content. TNFα treatment led to an increase in SSAT enzyme activity in these NSCLC cells (Fig. 1B) and a modest reduction in the intracellular polyamine content (Fig. 2). The decrease in polyamine content is consistent with the -fold induction in the SSAT enzyme activity by TNFα in the NSCLC cells.FIGURE 2TNFα decreases intracellular polyamines in NSCLC cells. A549 and H157 cells were seeded and grown for 24 h, after which they were treated with either vehicle (white bars) or TNFα (black and gray bars) for 1 h. Putrescine (A), spermidine (B), and spermine (C) were detected by high pressure liquid chromatography. The polyamine levels were normalized to the protein in the samples and plotted. The result is the mean of two different experiments performed in duplicate ± S.D.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) TNFα Activates NFκB Signaling in NSCLC Cells—One of the major signaling pathways by which TNFα is known to work is by activating NFκB signaling in the cell. In unstimulated cells, NFκB resides in the cytosol in a latent form bound to IκBα. Stimulation of the cell with TNFα triggers a series of signaling events that ultimately leads to the phosphorylation of IκBα by IKK, which then becomes a target of ubiquitin-proteosomal degradation. The phosphorylation and subsequent degradation of IκBα triggers the translocation of NFκB complex (p65-p50) protein from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, where it regulates the expression of multiple genes. The finding that TNFα induces SSAT expression and the fact that TNFα functions predominantly via NFκB signaling led us to determine the functionality of the NFκB signaling in these NSCLC cells. Treatment of A549 cells with TNFα produced a rapid reduction in the IκBα protein (Fig. 3A), with a concomitant rapid increase in nuclear translocation of the p65 protein in the A549 cells (Fig. 3B). Similar effects on IκBα and p65 protein were observed in the H157 cells (data not shown). Transient transfection experiments were performed with an NFκB reporter construct to determine whether translocation of p65 into the cell nucleus was accompanied by a functional increase in the NFκB-responsive genes. As shown in Fig. 3C, TNFα treatment led t"

Although the structure of the free hormone has been extensively characterized, a variety of evidence suggests that a conformational change occurs upon receptor binding. Here, we employ chiral mutagenesis, comparison of corresponding d and l amino acid substitutions, to investigate a possible switch in the B-chain. To investigate the interrelation of structure, function, and stability, isomeric analogs have been synthesized in which an invariant glycine in a β-turn (GlyB8) is replaced by d- or l-Ser. The d substitution enhances stability (ΔΔGu 0.9 kcal/mol) but impairs receptor binding by 100-fold; by contrast, the l substitution markedly impairs stability (ΔΔGu -3.0 kcal/mol) with only 2-fold reduction in receptor binding. Although the isomeric structures each retain a native-like overall fold, the l-SerB8 analog exhibits fewer helix-related and long range nuclear Overhauser effects than does the d-SerB8 analog or native monomer. Evidence for enhanced conformational fluctuations in the unstable analog is provided by its attenuated CD spectrum. The inverse relationship between stereospecific stabilization and receptor binding strongly suggests that the B7-B10 β-turn changes conformation on receptor binding.

Weiss M.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5858-5866Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). What sites in the insulin molecule might function as a structural switch? Here, we employ chiral mutagenesis, comparison of corresponding d and l amino acid substitutions (6Nakagawa S.H. Zhao M. Hua Q.X. Hu S.Q. Wan Z.L. Jia W. Weiss M.A. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 4984-4999Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), to uncover non-standard structure-function relationships. Our studies focus on the B7-B10 β-turn, the hinge between the N-terminal β-strand and central α-helix of the B-chain. An inverse relationship between protein stability and activity provides a stereospecific signature of induced fit. Our strategy exploits the right hand side of the Ramachandran plane: substitution of a glycine with positive φ angle (and hence residing in a region ordinarily “forbidden” to l amino acids) by a d amino acid (7Zhao M. Nakagawa S.H. Hua Q.X. Weiss M.A. Proc. Am. Peptide Symp. 1998; : 369-371Google Scholar, 8Anil B. Song B. Tang Y. Raleigh D.P. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004; 126: 13194-13195Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The site of substitution (GlyB8; arrow in Fig. 1A and red balls in Fig. 1B) is invariant among mammalian insulins and insulin-like growth factors (9Blundell T.L. Humbel R.E. Nature. 1980; 287: 781-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). GlyB8 lies on the surface of a type II β-turn comprising residues B7-B10 (Fig. 1, C and D). This turn contains CysB7 (part of the canonical A7-B7 disulfide bridge; highlighted in gold in Fig. 1, C and D) and so provides a link between the central B-chain α-helix and the A-chain. Substitution of GlyB8 by l amino acids impairs the folding of a single chain insulin precursor (10Guo Z.Y. Zhang Z. Jia X.Y. Tang Y.H. Feng Y.M. Acta Biochim. Biophys. Sin (Shanghai). 2005; 37: 673-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) and impedes disulfide pairing in insulin chain combination (6Nakagawa S.H. Zhao M. Hua Q.X. Hu S.Q. Wan Z.L. Jia W. Weiss M.A. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 4984-4999Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Substitution of a turn-specific d-glycine by a d amino acid would by contrast be expected to enhance the stability of the native fold (7Zhao M. Nakagawa S.H. Hua Q.X. Weiss M.A. Proc. Am. Peptide Symp. 1998; : 369-371Google Scholar, 8Anil B. Song B. Tang Y. Raleigh D.P. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004; 126: 13194-13195Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Respective sites of l and d substituents are indicated in blue (the pro-l Hα of GlyB8; Fig. 1D) or magenta (pro-d Hα). Whereas previous studies of d- and l-AlaB8 insulin analogs established such reciprocal effects on stability, the l analog was observed to misfold; aberrant aggregation prevented structural studies and confounded interpretation of its biological activity (6Nakagawa S.H. Zhao M. Hua Q.X. Hu S.Q. Wan Z.L. Jia W. Weiss M.A. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 4984-4999Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Fortuitously, these limitations may be circumvented through the use of d- and l-Ser. In this article we describe the solution structures of d- and l-SerB8 analogs of an engineered insulin monomer. Such engineering is required to avoid dimerization and higher order protein assembly (11Brange J. Ribel U. Hansen J.F. Dodson G. Hansen M.T. Havelund S. Melberg S.G. Norris F. Norris K. Snel L. Nature. 1988; 333: 679-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar), which would otherwise limit the feasibility of NMR analysis (12Weiss M.A. Hua Q.X. Lynch C.S. Frank B.H. Shoelson S.E. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 7373-7389Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). A monomeric template is provided by DKP-insulin, 2The abbreviations used are: DKP-insulin, insulin analog containing three substitutions in B-chain (AspB10, LysB28 and ProB29); DG, distance geometry; DQF-COSY, double-quantum-filtered correlated spectroscopy; NOEs, nuclear Overhauser enhancements; NOESY, NOE spectroscopy; RMD, restrained molecular dynamics; RMSD, root-mean-square deviation; TOCSY, total correlation spectroscopy. which contains three amino acid substitutions in the B-chain (AspB10, LysB28, and ProB29; magenta in Fig. 1A and Ref. 13Shoelson S.E. Lu Z.X. Parlautan L. Lynch C.S. Weiss M.A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 1757-1767Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The structure of DKP-insulin and its use as a template for study of mutations of interest have previously been described (14Hua Q.X. Hu S.Q. Frank B.H. Jia W. Chu Y.C. Wang S.H. Burke G.T. Katsoyannis P.G. Weiss M.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 390-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 15Xu B. Hua Q.X. Nakagawa S.H. Jia W. Chu Y.C. Katsoyannis P.G. Weiss M.A. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 104-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Our results demonstrate that whereas both d- and l-SerB8-DKP-insulin retain native-like overall folds, the l analog exhibits a profound decrease in thermodynamic stability associated with attenuation of CD-derivedα-helix content. Further, whereas the NOESY spectrum of d-SerB8-DKP-insulin is similar to that of DKP-insulin, the spectrum of l-SerB8-DKP-insulin exhibits fewer helix-related and long range contacts, presumably because of enhanced nonlocal conformational fluctuations. Such modulation of protein dynamics suggests that stereospecific frustration of the B8 φ angle is coupled to a global change in the free energy landscape (16Nymeyer H. Garcia A.E. Onuchic J.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5921-5928Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Despite such perturbations, l-SerB8-DKP-insulin retains near-native receptor binding affinity whereas the affinity of d-Ser-DKP-insulin is reduced by 100-fold. This inverse relationship between stereospecific stabilization and receptor binding strongly suggests that GlyB8, and in turn the B7-B10 β-turn, changes conformation on receptor binding. Materials—Human insulin was kindly provided by Eli Lilly and Co. (Indianapolis, IN). All other chemicals were of analytical grade (Fisher Chemicals). Synthesis of Insulin Analogs—The tetra-S-sulfonate derivative of the human A-chain was obtained by oxidative sulfitolysis (17Hu S.Q. Burke G.T. Schwartz G.P. Ferderigos N. Ross J.B. Katsoyannis P.G. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2631-2635Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). B-chain analogs were prepared by solid phase chemical synthesis as described (17Hu S.Q. Burke G.T. Schwartz G.P. Ferderigos N. Ross J.B. Katsoyannis P.G. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2631-2635Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In brief (N-tert-butoxycarbonyl, O-benzyl)-Thr-PAM resin (0.56 mmol/g; Bachem, Inc.) was used as solid support for synthesis of B-chain analogs. The d-SerB8-DKP B-chain was prepared by automated solid-phase synthesis using F-moc chemistry (18Nakagawa S.H. Tager H.S. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 3204-3214Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). For synthesis of the l-SerB8-DKP B-chain, a manual double-coupling t-BOC protocol was followed (17Hu S.Q. Burke G.T. Schwartz G.P. Ferderigos N. Ross J.B. Katsoyannis P.G.

Analogs were purified by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) as described (17Hu S.Q. Burke G.T. Schwartz G.P. Ferderigos N. Ross J.B. Katsoyannis P.G. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2631-2635Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Whereas the yield of the d analog was at least as high as that of DKP-insulin, the yield of the l analog was reduced by >10-fold. Predicted molecular masses were confirmed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry (MS). Receptor Binding Assays—Relative activity is defined as the ratio of analog to wild-type human insulin required to displace 50% of specifically bound 125I-human insulin. A human placental membrane preparation containing the insulin receptor (IR) was employed as described (21Weiss M.A. Hua Q.-X. Jia W. Nakagawa S.H. Chu Y.-C. Hu S.-Q. Katsoyannis P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40018-40024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In all assays the percentage of tracer bound in the absence of competing ligand was <15% to avoid ligand-depletion artifacts. Circular Dichroism—Far-ultraviolet (UV) CD spectra were obtained as described (22Hua Q.-X. Nakagawa S.H. Jia W. Hu S.Q. Chu Y.-C. Katsoyannis P.G. Weiss M.A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 12299-12311Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Spectra, acquired with an Aviv spectropolarimeter (Aviv Biomedical, Inc., Lakewood, NJ), were normalized by mean residue ellipticity. Estimates of secondary structure were obtained by deconvolution using an iterative singular value decomposition algorithm as described (23Sreerama N. Woody R.W. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 209: 32-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (946) Google Scholar). Samples were dissolved in 10 mm phosphate and 50 mm KCl (pH 7.4) at a protein concentration of ∼25 μm. For equilibrium denaturation studies, samples were diluted to 5 μm; guanidine-HCl was employed as denaturant (24Hua Q.X. Chu Y.C. Jia W. Wang R.Y. Katsoyannis P.G. Weiss M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43443-43453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Data were obtained at 4 °C and fitted by non-linear least squares to a two-state model (25Sosnick T.R. Fang X. Shelton V.M. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 317: 393-409Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). NMR Spectroscopy—DKP-insulin, employed as a template for study of B8 analogs, contains substitutions HisB10→ Asp, ProB28→ Lys, and LysB29→ Pro. Spectra were obtained at 700 MHz as described (14Hua Q.X. Hu S.Q. Frank B.H. Jia W. Chu Y.C. Wang S.H. Burke G.T. Katsoyannis P.G. Weiss M.A. J. Mol.

Resonance assignment was based on homonuclear two-dimensional NOESY (mixing times 80 and 200 ms), total correlation spectroscopy (TOCSY; mixing time 55 ms), and double-quantum filtered correlated spectroscopy (DQF-COSY). Helix-related hydrogen bonds were inferred from the pattern of protected amide resonances as observed in D2O solution containing 20% deuteroacetic acid (27Hua Q.X. Jia W. Frank B.H. Weiss M.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 230: 387-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Molecular Modeling—Structures were calculated by distance geometry/simulated annealing (DG/SA) using program DG-II (15Xu B. Hua Q.X. Nakagawa S.H. Jia W. Chu Y.C. Katsoyannis P.G. Weiss M.A. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 104-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar); restrained molecular dynamics (RMD) calculations were performed using X-PLOR (28Brunger A.T. XPLOR Manual. Version 3.1. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1993Google Scholar). d- and l-SerB8-DKP-insulin exhibit receptor-binding affinities of 1.1 ± 0.1 and 90 ± 6% relative to native human insulin (column 2 in Table 1). Because the relative affinity of DKP-insulin is 161 ± 19 under these conditions (enhanced binding is caused by the AspB10 substitution (29Schwartz G.P. Burke G.T. Katsoyannis P.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 6408-6411Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar)), specific effects of the d and l B8 substitutions on affinity relative to the parent monomer are ca. 0.7 and 55%, respectively. The far-UV CD spectrum of d-SerB8-DKP-insulin exhibits a slight accentuation of helix-specific features at 196, 208, and 222 nm relative to the spectrum of DKP-insulin (filled circles and solid line, respectively, in Fig. 2A). Conversely, the CD spectrum of l-SerB8-DKP-insulin is attenuated at helix-sensitive wavelengths (open circles in Fig. 2A). Because the precision of the measured ellipticities in the range 200-250 nm is ±1%, these stereospecific differences are significant. Respective values of mean residue ellipticity at 196, 208, and 222 nm are given in Table 2, A. Deconvolution suggests d-specific enhancement, and complementary l-specific attenuation, of mean α-helix content (Table 2, B). Such changes may in principle reflect either static structural changes or stereospecific modulation of conformational fluctuations within helical elements (see below).TABLE 1Activities and stabilities of insulin analogsAnalogBindingaBinding activity is defined by affinity for the human placental insulin receptor relative to human insulin (100%); under these conditions the Kd for native insulin is 0.48 ± 0.06 nm.

Open table in a new tab d- and l-SerB8-DKP-insulin exhibit marked differences in thermodynamic stability. Whereas the d-SerB8 analog is more resistant to denaturation in concentrated solutions of guanidine hydrochloride than is DKP-insulin, the l analog is more sensitive (Fig. 2B). Fitting of these CD-detected denaturation curves by a two-state model yields ΔΔGu values of 0.9 ± 0.2 kcal/mol (d analog) and -3.0 ± 0.2 kcal/mol (l) relative to DKP-insulin (Table 1). The difference in stability between stereoisomers is thus 3.9 ± 0.3 kcal/mol. This difference is significantly greater than would be expected based on chiral inversion within an isolated β-strand and so implies non-local effects of the substitution in one or both analogs. 1H NMR spectra of l- and d-SerB8-DKP-insulin at pH 7.4 (spectra a and b in Fig. 2C) exhibit a pattern of resonance line widths and chemical shift dispersion similar to that of DKP-insulin (spectrum c in Fig. 2C). Although differences are apparent in details of these spectra, similar (but not identical) patterns of upfield-shifted methyl resonances (0.00-0.70 ppm) and downfield-shifted Hα resonances (4.8-5.3 ppm) are observed. The spectra are in each case tractable by standard homonuclear NMR methods (30Wuthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. John Wiley & Sons, New York, NY1986Crossref Google Scholar), permitting near-complete resonance assignment (see supplemental materials). Because analysis of exchangeable amide resonances is incomplete at neutral pH due to base-catalyzed solvent exchange and conformational broadening, additional data were obtained in 20% deuteroacetic acid; in this co-solvent insulin retains a native-like monomeric fold (31Hua Q.X. Weiss M.A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 5505-5515Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). In accord with estimates of ΔGu based on guanidine denaturation, the rate of amide proton exchange in 20% deuteroacetic acid and 80% D2O is markedly accelerated in the l-SerB8 analog and retarded in the d-SerB8 analog (see supplemental material). Quantitative interpretation of protection factors is limited by the absence of baseline exchange rates in this co-solvent. NMR Studies of the d Isomer—Chemical shifts are essentially identical to those observed in DKP-insulin; significant changes (magnitude >0.1 ppm) are observed only at neighboring residues CysB7 and SerB9 (supplemental material). The novel d-SerB8 spin system is well resolved (Fig. 3A). Analysis of secondary structure, based on diagnostic strings of dNN, dαN, d(i, i+3), and d(i, i+4) NOEs, is identical to that of DKP-insulin (supplemental material). The pattern of long range inter-residue NOEs is likewise similar, in each case consistent with structures of T-state crystallographic protomers. Key native-like long range NOEs are observed, for example, between aromatic and aliphatic side chains (Fig. 4, A and B). These include contacts between the side chains of PheB24/LeuB15 and TyrB26/ValB12, indicative of native-like B-chain supersecondary structure; between TyrA19/IleA2, indicative of native-like A-chain supersecondary structure; and between PheB1/LeuA13, HisB5/IleA10, TyrA19/LeuB15, and TyrB26/ValA3, indicative of a native-like orientation between chains. The upfield chemical shifts of the LeuB15 methyl resonances, sensitive to the ring current of PheB24, are essentially identical in the spectrum of the d-SerB8 analog (0.13 and 0.54 ppm) and in the spectrum of DKP-insulin (0.15 and 0.54 ppm). The upfield chemical shift of the ValB12 Hα resonance, sensitive to the ring currents of PheB24 and TyrB26, is also not significantly perturbed (3.12 ppm in the d-SerB8 analog versus 3.18 ppm in DKP-insulin; random-coil value 4.18 ppm). Such correspondence of secondary shifts provides evidence of structural similarity given the steep dependence of upfield ring currents on the relative distance and orientation between these side chains.FIGURE 4Long range NOEs in B8 analogs. NOESY spectra of DKP-insulin (A), d-SerB8-DKP-insulin (B), and l-SerB8-DKP-insulin (C) in region containing NOEs between aromatic protons (vertical axis; ω1) and aliphatic protons (horizontal axis; ω2). Assignments are as indicated; no non-native NOEs are observed. Conditions were as in Fig. 3; the mixing time was 200 ms.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) A summary of inter-residue NOEs is given as a diagonal plot (Fig. 3C). Maintenance of T-state-specific long range interactions by the N-terminal arm of the B-chain is demonstrated by retention of native-like inter-chain NOEs between the B1-A13 and B5-A10 side chains; examples are provided by contacts between the side chain of IleA10 and main chain atoms of AsnB3, GlnB4, and HisB5 (labeled a in Fig. 3C) and between the side chains of HisB5 and ThrA8 (labeled b). These contacts are extended by a network of interchain NOEs involving neighboring main chain and side chain protons in segments A6-A11 and B3-B7. The orientation of the B9-B19 α-helix relative to the A-chain, as probed by a network of long range NOEs in the hydrophobic core (supplemental material), is also unaffected. NOEs are observed from B8 HN to the methyl resonances of LeuB11 and from B8 Hα toγ1-CH3 resonance of ValB12; these contacts are in accord with corresponding NOEs in DKP-insulin. A novel side chain-specific NOE is observed from the β-CH2 group of d-SerB8 to the aromatic meta resonance of TyrB26 (but not to the methyl groups of ValA3, ValB12, and LeuB11, which might also be plausible based on wild-type crystal structures). NMR Studies of the l Isomer—The l-SerB8 spin system is likewise well resolved (Fig. 3B), and essentially complete resonance assignment was obtained (supplemental material). Inversion of B8 Cα chirality introduces non-local perturbations in NOEs and chemical shifts. Although the overall pattern of interresidue NOEs is native-like, helix-related strings of dNN, dαN, d(i, i+3), and d(i, i+4) contacts are less complete than those observed in spectra of DKP-insulin or d-SerB8-DKP-insulin. In total 51 fewer helix-related NOEs are observed; their attenuation seems consistent with the attenuated CD spectrum of the L analog. Chemical shifts are similar to but distinct from those in d-SerB8-DKP-insulin; significant changes (magnitude >0.1 ppm) are summarized in Table 3. Stereospecific perturbations are observed at adjoining residues CysB7 and SerB9, within contiguous structural elements (Δδ 0.22 ppm at GlnB4 Hα and 0.16 ppm at AspB10 Hβ), and at transmitted sites (0.19 ppm at CysB7 Hβ and 0.15 ppm at the meta resonances of PheB24). Significant chemical-shift differences between d and l analogs occur at residues A7, A10, B4, B5, B9, and B11 at pH 8; a corresponding set of perturbations is seen in 20% deuteroacetic acid (residues A2, A7, A10, B4-B6, and B10-B13).TABLE 3Stereospecific 1H NMR chemical shift differences (>0.1 ppm in magnitude)ResidueCαHCβHOthersA4 Glu0.10CγH2 0.10A6 Cys0.110.12A7 Cys0.19A10 Ile−0.10CγH2 −0.20, CδH3 −0.17B4 Gln0.220.18aB5 His−0.100.16B6 Leu0.15−0.10B7 Cys0.19B9 Ser−0.19B10 Asp0.16B11 Leu−0.120.13CγH −0.27B12 Val−0.16B15 Leu−0.15B24 Phemeta −0.16 Open table in a new tab Despite perturbations in chemical shifts and partial attenuation of helix-related NOEs, l-SerB8-DKP-insulin retains key native-like long range contacts (Fig. 4C). As in the d-SerB8 analog, native-like contacts between the side chains of PheB24/LeuB15 and TyrB26/ValB12 are maintained. However, the most upfield methyl chemical shift of LeuB15 (0.22 ppm) is less shifted relative to the random coil value (0.90 ppm) than the corresponding methyl resonance in DKP-insulin (0.15 ppm) or d-SerB8-DKP-insulin (0.13 ppm). Likewise, the upfield chemical shift of the ValB12 Hα resonance (3.28 ppm) is less shifted relative to the random coil value (4.18 ppm) than in DKP-insulin (3.18 ppm) or d-SerB8-DKP-insulin (3.12 ppm). This subtle trend in secondary shifts correlates with the order of thermodynamic stabilities (ΔGu; Table 1) and CD-derived helix contents (Table 2, B). We speculate that attenuation of 1H NMR secondary shifts in the l-SerB8 analog and attenuation of helixspecific mean residue ellipticities have a common physical origin: conformational fluctuations leading to averaging of ring current shifts in one case and optical chirality in the other. Despite such subtle 1H NMR features, a subset of native-like long range NOEs are retained between A- and B-chains. As in DKP-insulin and d-SerB8-DKP-insulin, strong contacts are observed between the side chains of TyrA19 and LeuB15. Although NOEs involving the N-terminal arm of the B-chain are less prominent than in the spectrum of the D analog (see below), T-like positioning of the N-terminal segment is retained as indicated by long range NOEs between the side chains of PheB1/LeuA13 and HisB5/IleA10. The orientation of the canonical B9-B19 α-helix relative to the A-chain is likewise defined by an analogous netwo"
https://openalex.org/W2053377460,"The AKAP gravin is a scaffold for protein kinases, phosphatases, and adaptor molecules obligate for resensitization and recycling of β2-adrenergic receptors. Gravin binds to the receptor through well characterized protein-protein interactions. These interactions are facilitated ∼1000-fold when gravin is anchored to the cytoplasmic leaflet of the plasma membrane. Although the N-terminal region (∼550 residues) is highly negatively charged and probably natively unfolded, it could anchor gravin to the inner leaflet through hydrophobic insertion of its N-terminal myristate and electrostatic binding of three short positively charged domains (PCDs). Loss of the site of N-myristoylation was found to affect neither AKAP macro-scopic localization nor AKAP function. Synthetic peptides corresponding to PCD1-3 bound in vitro to unilamellar phospholipid vesicles with high affinity, a binding reversed by calmodulin in the presence of Ca2+. In vivo gravin localization is regulated by intracellular Ca2+, a function mapping to the N terminus of the protein harboring PCD1, PCD2, and PCD3. Mutation of any two PCDs eliminates membrane association of the non-myristoylated gravin, the sensitivity to Ca2+/calmodulin, and the ability of this scaffold to catalyze receptor resensitization and recycling.

Scott J.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 959-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar). Gravin (a.k.a. AKAP250, AKAP12, SSeCKS) is a large AKAP with multivalency for cAMP-dependent kinase (PKA) and C (PKC), phosphoprotein phosphatases (such as PP2B), adaptor molecules, as well as for the G protein-coupled β2-adrenergic receptor (β2AR) (2Malbon C.C. Tao J. Wang H.Y. Biochem. J. 2004; 379: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Gravin interacts with the β2AR through a conserved receptor-binding domain (RBD) and is essential for resensitization and recycling of β2AR following agonist-induced desensitization/internalization (3Tao J. Wang H.Y. Malbon C.C. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 6419-6429Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Gravin has four regions that could help anchor it to cell membrane (4Gelman I.H. Front. Biosci. 2002; 7: d1782-d1797Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), i.e. a putative N-myristoylation site (5Farazi T.A. Waksman G. Gordon J.I. J. Biol.

The three PCDs in gravin are reminiscent of the basic/hydrophobic clusters in the effector domain of the myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate (MARCKS) (7Gambhir A. Hangyas-Mihalyne G.

Although not identical or homologous in sequence, these basic/hydrophobic regions in the other proteins (e.g. MARCKS) are all capable of binding to membranes and Ca2+/CaM with significant affinity. We explore herein how the myristate and three N-terminal PCDs contribute to membrane binding, and thus to the function of gravin. Why is membrane binding important? It localizes gravin to the plasma membrane, where it experiences ∼1000-fold higher effective concentration of membrane bound β2AR because of the well established “local concentration” or “reduction of dimensionality” effect (12McLaughlin S. Aderem A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 272-276Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). Membrane binding could be important for function, as it is for many other signaling molecules such as Src, protein kinase C (PKC), etc. Using an N-terminal-tagged gravin that cannot be myristoylated, we show that two PCDs are required for functioning of gravin in resensitization and recycling. We also show membrane binding, and thus function, can be reversed by Ca2+/CaM, which binds to each of the PCD with a sufficient affinity to compete with the membrane and cause translocation of gravin from membrane to cytoplasm. HA Tag and CFP Fusion Proteins—The HA-tagged fusion proteins of gravin, N-terminal-truncated HA-gravin, and C-terminal-truncated HA-gravin mutants were constructed as previously described (3Tao J. Wang H.Y. Malbon C.C. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 6419-6429Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) and inserted into an expression vector. To generate HA-tagged short, positively charged calmodulin-binding domains (PCD), the sense primers contained 5′-NheI site, and nucleotides encoding the HA tag (YPYDVPDYALV) followed by nucleotides corresponding to 171-177 (for PCD1) and amino acids 297-303 (for PCD2), and amino acids 510-516 (for PCD3). The antisense primers that were synthesized corresponded to amino acids 191-197 (for PCD1) and amino acids 314-320 (for PCD2), and amino acids 531-537 (for PCD3) of human gravin, with the addition of a BamH1 restriction site, following the stop code. The PCR products were cloned into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) between NheI and BamHI restriction sites. To generate HA tag gravin in which PCD1 and PCD2 regions were deleted (Gravin ΔPCD1,2), the sense primer contained a 5′-NheI site and nucleotides encoding the HA tag (YPYDVP-DYALV) in the front of the N terminus of gravin. The antisense primer corresponding to the sequence of gravin from 488-510 followed by ACC1 site (CCGGTCGACAATATCATTAGCCTGGGACTCAG). For the second fragment, the sense primer contain the ACC1 site corresponding to the sequence of gravin (CCGGTCGACACAGAAGAAGACGGAAAGGC), the anti-sense primer contain a BamHI site corresponding to the sequence of gravin (AGCAAGGATCCCGTCTGTCCCCGTCTC). The PCR products were cloned into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) between NheI and BamHI sites to generate a mutant form of gravin in which PCD1 and PCD2 are deleted. A similar approach was employed to delete the other pairs of PCDs in gravin. Briefly, to generate HA-tagged gravin with deletions of PCD1 and PCD3, primers were designed to delete amino acids 172-190. A restriction enzyme cutting site XhoI was inserted to delete PCD1. For the deletions of PCD3, amino acids 510-536, a restriction enzyme cutting site EcoRI was introduced by PCR. To generate HA-tagged gravin in which PCD2 and PCD3 are deleted, primers were designed to delete amino acids 296-317 by engineering a restriction enzyme cutting site XhoI to delete PCD2, followed by use of primers to delete PCD3, amino acids 510-536, to introduce a restriction enzyme cutting site EcoRI by PCR. The glycine-to-alanine substitution mutant G2A of gravin-GFP was engineered by standard protocol for PCR-mediated mutagenesis. All of the polymerase chain reactions were performed using Pfu polymerase (Stratagene). The identity of the amplified sequences was confirmed by direct DNA sequencing. Gravin-CFP and gravin ΔPCD1,2-CFP were constructed in a technical manner very similar to that employed for HA-tagged gravin and HA-tagged gravin ΔPCD1,2, except that the vector used in this case was CFP-N1 (Clontech) and the C-terminal of gravin (lacking a stop code) was followed by the CFP moiety as a fusion protein. PCD1-CFP and PCD2-CFP were generated similar to that employed for HA-PCD1 and HA-PCD2, except that CFP-N1 (Clontech) was used as vector and the C-terminal of each peptide (without stop code) were followed by CFP moiety to create a fusion protein. All of the polymerase chain reactions were performed using Pfu polymerase (Stratagene). The identity of the amplified sequences was confirmed by direct DNA sequencing. Cell Culture—Human epidermoid carcinoma cells (A431) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone, Logan, UT), penicillin (60 μg/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml) and grown in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air at 37 °C. Expression of HA- and Fluorophore-tagged Mutant and Wild-type Versions of Gravin—A431 cells were transfected with expression vectors harboring either gravin-GFP or a truncated version of gravin-CFP using Lipofectamine® (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's protocol. The viable clones were selected in the presence of 400 μg/ml of the neomycin analogue G418. Resistant colonies were subcloned and screened for GFP or CFP fusion protein expression by fluorescence microscopy. Cells transfected with HA-tagged gravin were selected in 200 μg/ml of the hygromycin and screened for expression of an HA-tagged fusion protein by SDS-PAGE of whole cell lysates followed by immunoblotting, using anti-HA antibodies. Calmodulin Binding Assay—HA-tagged gravin and HA-tagged truncated gravin, or the HA-tagged, suspected CaM-binding regions were expressed in A431 cells by transient transfection. Cells were harvested and lysed in a lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm CaCl2, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% Nonidet-40, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 100 μg/ml bacitracin, 100 μg/ml benzamidine). Cell lysates were subject to filtration though a column packed with Sepharose-4B to which CaM was covalently attached. The column chromatography was performed according to the instruction of the manufacturer (Amersham Biosciences). Proteins and/or peptides retained by the immobilized CaM were eluted from the matrix by stripping the Ca2+ from the matrix using a 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl buffer containing 2 mm EDTA. The eluted proteins were dialyzed against 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 buffer and the resultant-dialyzed proteins were concentrated by a vacuum centrifugation. The purified proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE on 10-20% acrylamide gels and the separated proteins were transferred electrophoretically from the gel to the nitrocellulose membrane. The HA-tagged proteins and/or peptides were stained in the blots by making use of an anti-HA antibody. The immune complexes were detected using a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody, in combination with the chemiluminescence reagent, and a brief autoradiography of Kodak X-Omat film. Binding of PCD Synthetic Peptides to Vesicles and to Calmodulin—Peptides corresponding to the three PCDs shown in Fig. 2 were synthesized with a Cys residue added to the N terminus; the ends were blocked with acetyl and amide groups. The peptides were labeled with radioactive N-[3H]ethylmaleimide (NEM) as described previously (7Gambhir A. Hangyas-Mihalyne G. Zaitseva I. Cafiso D.S. Wang J. Murray D. Pentyala S.N. Smith S.O.

We measured the binding of these [3H]NEM-labeled peptides to sucrose-loaded PC/PS 100 nm diameter large unila-mellar vesicles (LUVs) using a centrifugation technique described previously (7Gambhir A. Hangyas-Mihalyne G. Zaitseva I. Cafiso D.S. Wang J. Murray D. Pentyala S.N. Smith S.O. McLaughlin S. Biophys.

Briefly, sucrose-loaded PC/PS LUVs were mixed with labeled peptide (2-10 nm) and the mixture centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h to spin down the vesicles and bound peptide. The percentage of bound peptide was calculated from the radioactivity of the peptide in both the supernatant and in the pellet using Equation 1. As considered in detail elsewhere (14Peitzsch R.M.

A, the sequence of human gravin was scanned for two motifs, the effector domain of the MARCKS protein and for CaM binding sites. Two other landmarks of gravin are displayed: the AKAP sites that constitute the β2-adrenergic receptor binding domain; and the binding site for the RII subunit of PKA. These data were obtained using ProSite software. B, full-length HA-tagged, C-terminal and N-terminal truncated gravin mutants were generated for analysis of their ability to bind to CaM immobilized to Sepharose-4B in the presence of Ca2+. Upper panel C, HA-tagged gravin and mutant forms were expressed in A431 cells, whole cell lysates of the cells were subjected to SDS-PAGE, immunoblotted, and stained with anti-HA antibodies. Lower panel C, fragments of gravin that were retained by immobilized CaM matrix, released from the matrix using buffer containing EDTA, subjected to SDS-PAGE, immunoblotted and stained with anti-HA antibodies. The data presented are representative of at least three separate determinations, each performed with separate cell lysates.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) where [P]mem/[P]tot is fraction of peptide bound to membranes, [L]acc is the accessible lipid concentration (one-half the total lipid concentration because we add the peptide to preformed vesicles), and K is the molar partition coefficient. (An identical equation results if one assumes, incorrectly, that the peptide forms a 1:1 complex with a lipid.) We used a modified version of Equation 1 to describe the effect of Ca2+/CaM on the membrane binding of the PCD peptides, incorporating the assumption that Ca2+/CaM and the membrane compete for the peptide (8McLaughlin S. Smith S.O. Hayman M.J. Murray D. J. Gen. Physiol. 2005; 126: 41-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) in Equation 2, Pmem/Ptot=KLacc1+KLacc+KCa/CaMCa2+/CaM(Eq. 2) where KCaCaM is the association constant of the peptide with Ca2+/CaM. Special conditions were required to estimate the binding of the PCD1 peptide to membranes and to calmodulin. It is apparent from Fig. 2 that the PCD1 region has fewer basic (blue) and more hydrophobic (green) residues than either the PCD2 or PCD3 regions. Thus a peptide corresponding to PCD1 will have the greatest tendency to aggregate in solution. Although the PCD1 peptide, gravin (171-187), appeared to dissolve in solution by visual inspection, it clearly formed aggregates because this peptide (unlike the PCD2 and PCD3 peptides) was significantly removed from solution by centrifugation. Thus measurements corresponding to Fig. 3A with PCD1 peptide (not shown), and those shown in Fig. 3C were conducted with 0.01% Triton X-100 added to the solutions to solubilize the peptide. Addition of detergent will decrease the affinity of the peptide for the membrane (and probably Ca2+/CaM), so the affinity values reported in Table 1 for gravin (171-187) should be regarded as underestimates. As a control, we studied the effect of Triton X-100 on the membrane binding of the (apparently soluble) gravin (297-317) peptide. In experiments similar to those illustrated in Fig. 3A with 2:1 PC/PS vesicles, we found that the K value decreased exponentially (binding energy decreased linearly) with the % detergent over the range from 0 to 0.025%. Fortunately, the value extrapolated from the measurements with detergent agreed well with the actual value measured in the absence of detergent for gravin (297-317), suggesting the peptide is present as a monomer in the absence of detergent. The observation that a 2-fold increase in peptide concentration did not affect the value of K is also consistent with the assumption the peptides are binding as monomers to the membrane.TABLE 1Binding of gravin PCDs to artificial lipid vesiclesPeptideKKCa/CaMM−1M−1Gravin-(171-187)1 × 1045 × 107Gravin-(297-317)8 × 1042 × 108Gravin-(510-536)1 × 1049 × 107 Open table in a new tab Confocal Microscopy—A431 cells stably expressing gravin-GFP, truncated gravin-CFP, or HA-tagged gravin and propagated on glass slides were either left untreated or stimulated with 10 μm isoproterenol for 30 min, 10 μm A23187 for 30 min, or 20 μm BAPTA-AM for 6 h and then washed twice with Hank's balanced salt solution, fixed (2% paraformaldehyde, pH 7.2). For immunostaining studies, cells were permeabilized and stained with anti-HA antigen rabbit antibodies used in combination with anti-rabbit Texas Red antibodies (Molecular Probes). Stained objects were imbedded in ProLong (Molecular Probes) anti-fade reagent. Images were acquired on the Zeiss LCM510 microscope using argon and helium-neon lasers (oilimmersion, ×63 objective). Serial sections were acquired as a Z-stack. Z-stacks of images were exported as TIFF files and processed in Adobe Photoshop 5.5. FPLC Calmodulin Binding Assay—HA-tagged PCD1, -PCD2, and -PCD3 fragments, each were expressed via transient transfection into A431 cells. Cells were harvested and lysed in a lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm CaCl2, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 100 μg/ml bacitracin, 100 μg/ml benzamidine). Cell lysates were subjected to column chromatography on CaM-immobilized Sepharose-4B matrix. Bound peptides were eluted from the medium by stripping the matrix of Ca2+ using a gradient of EDTA (0-3 mm). The eluted fractions were collected at 1-ml intervals. The eluted proteins were dialyzed in 10 mm Tris buffer pH 7.4 to remove salt and concentrated in a vacuum centrifugation. The purified proteins were separated by 10-20% SDS-PAGE, transferred electro-phoretically to nitrocellulose blots, and the resolved proteins stained by immunoblotting using anti-HA antigen primary antibodies. Knockdown Studies of Gravin—Antisense morpholino oligonucleotides (morpholins) were synthesized and purified to cell culture grade (Gene Tools, LLC). Before addition to A431 cells, morpholinos were mixed at a ratio of 1:1 (w/w) with EPEI special delivery solution (Gene Tools, LLC). Cells were treated with morpholinos (5 μg/ml) for 3 days. An additional treatment with morpholinos was performed prior to transfection of the cells with either wild-type or mutant forms of gravin. Following this protocol, cells were analyzed for β-adrenergic agonist-induced (i.e. isoproterenol, 10 μm) desensitization and recovery (i.e. resensitization) after washout of agonist. The suppression of gravin expression was confirmed by SDS-PAGE of whole cell lysates followed by immunoblotting. Similarly, loading controls were established by immunoblotting of actin. Identical treatment of the cultures with “scrambled” sequence morpholinos (designed by the commercial supplier) were employed as a control. Protocols for Desensitization and Resensitization of β2AR—Two days prior to the analysis of agonist-induced desensitization, the A431 cells were seeded in 96-well microtiter plates at a density of 25,000-50,000 cells/well. Routinely cells were serum-starved overnight, prior to analysis. Desensitization was accomplished by pretreating the cells with the β-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol (10 μm) for 30 min. Under these conditions, subsequent β-adrenergic stimulation of cyclic AMP accumulation is severely blunted and the number of cell-surface receptors declines precipitously as the receptors are sequestered and internalized (17Morris A.J. Malbon C.C. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 1373-1430Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). Details of the desensitization protocol are described elsewhere (18Shih M. Lin F. Scott J.D. Wang H.Y. Malbon C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1588-1595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Analysis of β2AR Internalization and Recovery of β2AR to the Cell Membrane—The internalization of β2AR correlates well with the extent of agonist-induced desensitization. Using the binding of a cell-impermeant, radiolabeled antagonist for the determination of cell surface β2ARs, the functional status of the recovery of internalized β2AR could be assayed with great accuracy. Cultures of A431 cells were treated with isoproterenol for 30 min (i.e.“desensitized”) or treated with isoproterenol for 30 min then washed free of agonist for 60 min (i.e.“resensitized”). The cells then were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in DMEM containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4) and the hydrophilic, membrane-impermeant β2-adrenergic antagonist [3H]CGP-12177 (70 nm). Binding was performed at 4 °C for 6 h. The cells were diluted, collected on GF/C membranes at reduced pressure, and washed rapidly. The radioligand bound to the washed cell mass on the filter represents a direct assay of the cell surface complement of receptors. The amount of bound ligand was quantified by liquid scintillation spectrometry (18Shih M. Lin F. Scott J.D. Wang H.Y. Malbon C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1588-1595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 19Shih M. Malbon C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21478-21483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). N-Myristoylation of Gravin Is Not Required for Function—Human gravin possesses the N-terminal sequence N-MGAGSSTEQR, a well known signal recognition sequence for N-myristoylation (5Farazi T.A. Waksman G. Gordon J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39501-39504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar, 20Gordon J.I. Duronio R.J. Rudnick D.A. Adams S.P. Gokel G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8647-8650Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a co-translational modification affording weak protein-membrane interactions. Gravin (Mr ∼250,000) was engineered either with the hemagglutinin tag (HA-gravin) at the N terminus (effectively precluding N-myristoylation) or as a fusion protein with the enhanced green fluorescent protein at the C terminus (gravin-GFP, Mr ∼275,000), and stably expressed in human epidermoid carcinoma A431 cells (Fig. 1A). Confocal microscopy of cells shows HA-tagged gravin and gravin-GFP throughout the cell, except in the nucleus, and prominent at the cell membrane (Fig. 1B). Membrane-associated gravin is labeled with white arrows, whereas the cytosolic gravin is labeled with yellow arrowheads. The macroscopic pattern of localization for gravin was unaffected by the loss of the N-myristoylation (Fig. 1B). To test the functional role of N-myristoylation itself on gravin function, we compared the functional capabilities of wild-type (WT) gravin to that of a gravin-GFP (G2A) mutant. To assess function, we first treated cells with isoproterenol (10 μm, 30 min; +ISO) to promote agonist-induced desensitization and internalization of β2AR (Fig. 1C). Cells made deficient of gravin (knockdown, KD) through treatment with antisense morpholinos fail to display recycling of agonist-stimulated internalized β2AR (gravin KD), as measured by radioligand binding experiments with the cell-impermeant β-adrenergic antagonist [3H]CGP-12177 that can only access cell surface β2AR. At 60-min postwashout of the isoproterenol (W60), knockdown of gravin attenuates the recycling of internalized β2AR. β2AR internalized in response to agonist treatment do not recycle in the gravin-KD cells (Fig. 1C). We compared the ability of expression of wild-type (myristoylated) gravin versus that of the G2A mutant of gravin (non-myristoylated) to rescue the recycling of internalized β2AR in cells in which endogenous gravin was suppressed. Expression of either the wild-type gravin or the G2A gravin mutant reconstituted the ability of the cells to rescue the recycling of the internalized β2AR. These observations demonstrate that N-myristoylation itself is not required for gravin function. Similarly, gravin tagged on the N terminus with the HA antigen has been shown to function normally (3Tao J. Wang H.Y. Malbon C.C. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 6419-6429Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Thus wild-type gravin, unlike Src and MARCKS (which use myristate and a single PCD), does not require the myristate for membrane localization and function, although we cannot rule out that N-mysritoylation might facilitate some other subtle albeit important aspect of membrane localization for the AKAP. In view of these data, we adopted the use of the HA-tagged gravin which cannot be myristoylated in some of these studies. Identification of Three MARCKS Effector Domain-like Regions in Gravin—We and others have identified three positively charged domains (PCDs) in gravin (4Gelman I.H. Front.

Nature. 2005; 438: 605-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar). These PCDs all contain both basic (blue: Lys, Arg) and hydrophobic (green; Phe, Met, Leu, Val, Cys, Trp) residues, but lack acidic residues: PCD1 (171GFKKVFKFVGFKFTVKK187); PCD2 (297KKFFTQGWAGWRKKTSFRKPK317); and, PCD3 (510KVQGSPLKKLFTSTGLKKLSGKKQKGK536). These PCDs are found in the N terminus of gravin and in the mouse SSeCKS (4Gelman I.H. Front. Biosci. 2002; 7: d1782-d1797Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 2A). We hypothesize each of these regions can act in a manner similar to the effector domain of MARCKS protein, i.e. bind electrostatically to acidic lipids on the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane and have this binding reversed by Ca2+/CaM (21McLaughlin S. Murray D. Nature. 2005; 438: 605-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar). Analysis of the N-terminal domain of gravin using the programs PONDR (22Romero P. Obradovic Z. Dunker A.K. Appl.

Insulin granules are kept acidic by luminal pumping of protons with simultaneous Cl− uptake to maintain electroneutrality. Experiments using patched, dialyzed β-cells prompted the suggestion that acute granule acidification by glucose underlies amplification of insulin secretion. However, others found glucose to increase granular pH in intact islets. In this study, we measured islet granular pH with Lysosensor DND-160, a fluorescent dye that permits ratiometric determination of pH < 6in acidic compartments. Stimulation of mouse islets with glucose reversibly decreased granular pH by mechanisms that are dependent on metabolism and Cl− ions but independent of changes in [Ca2+]c and protein kinase A or C activity. Granular pH was increased by concanamycin (blocker of the vesicular type H+-ATPase) > methylamine (weak base) > Cl− omission. Concanamycin and methylamine did not alter glucose-induced [Ca2+]c increase in islets but strongly inhibited the two phases of insulin secretion. Omission of Cl− did not affect the first phase but decreased the second phase of both [Ca2+]c and insulin responses. Neither experimental condition affected the [Ca2+]c rise induced by 30 mm KCl, but the insulin responses were inhibited by concanamycin > methylamine and not affected by Cl− omission. The amplification of insulin secretion by glucose was not suppressed. We conclude that an acidic granular pH is important for insulin secretion but that the acute further acidification produced by glucose is not essential for the augmentation of secretion via the amplifying pathway.

We conclude that an acidic granular pH is important for insulin secretion but that the acute further acidification produced by glucose is not essential for the augmentation of secretion via the amplifying pathway. Insulin secretion by pancreatic β-cells is finely regulated by the interaction of nutrients, hormones, and neurotransmitters. The influence of glucose is paramount and exerted via two hierarchical signaling pathways, which both depend on glucose metabolism in β-cells (1Henquin J.C. Ravier M.A. Nenquin M. Jonas J.C. Gilon P. Eur. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 33: 742-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The triggering pathway involves changes in cytosolic adenine nucleotide concentration (2Detimary P.

Simultaneously, glucose sets in motion an amplifying pathway that does not involve a further rise in [Ca2+]c but an augmentation of the Ca2+ efficacy on secretion (7Gembal M. Gilon P. Henquin J.C. J.

The mechanisms of the metabolic amplification are distinct from those by which hormones and neurotransmitters augment insulin secretion (1Henquin J.C. Ravier M.A. Nenquin M. Jonas J.C. Gilon P. Eur.

After exclusion of many potential mediators (10Sato Y. Henquin J.C.

A. 1999; 96: 760-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). How these potential mediators could exert their effect has not been resolved, but an interesting hypothesis suggests that the increase in ATP/ADP ratio primes insulin granules to release by decreasing their pH (16Barg S. Huang P. Eliasson L. Nelson D.J. Obermuller S. Rorsman P. Thevenod F. Renstrom E. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2145-2154Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).The pH of insulin granules is acidic (17Abrahamsson H. Gylfe E. Acta Physiol.

Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 2273-2281Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). It was estimated to be between 5 and 6 in preparations of isolated granules (19Hutton J.C. Biochem. J. 1982; 204: 171-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), and morphological approaches showed it to decrease from ∼6.5 to ∼5 with maturation of secretory vesicles in rat β-cells (20Orci L. Ravazzola M. Amherdt M. Madsen O. Perrelet A. Vassalli J.D. Anderson R.G. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 2273-2281Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 21Orci L. Halban P. Perrelet A. Amherdt M. Ravazzola M. Anderson R.G. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1149-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). This acidification is thought to permit sequential action of pH-dependent prohormone convertases in the proteolytic processing of proinsulin (20Orci L. Ravazzola M. Amherdt M. Madsen O. Perrelet A.

Diabetologia. 1992; 35: S41-S48Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and to favor storage of insoluble Zn2+-insulin hexamers (19Hutton J.C. Biochem. J. 1982; 204: 171-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar).The first suggestion that glucose promotes H+ uptake by insulin granules stemmed from observations of acridine orange accumulation in clusters of rat islet cells (18Pace C.S. Sachs G. Am. J. Physiol. 1982; 242: C382-C387Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, attempts to measure changes of granular pH in real time have been reported. They were based on the expression of a pH-sensitive green fluorescent protein targeted to insulin granules (24Tompkins L.S. Nullmeyer K.D. Murphy S.M. Weber C.S. Lynch R.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: C429-C437Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar) or on cell loading with a non-ratiometric fluorescent pH probe, Lysosensor DND-189 (16Barg S. Huang P. Eliasson L. Nelson D.J. Obermuller S. Rorsman P. Thevenod F. Renstrom E. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2145-2154Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Eto K. Yamashita T. Hirose K. Tsubamoto Y. Ainscow E.K. Rutter G.A. Kimura S. Noda M. Iino M. Kadowaki T. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: E262-E271Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The results of these studies are contradictory. Glucose slightly increased pH of secretory vesicles in normal mouse islets (25Eto K. Yamashita T. Hirose K. Tsubamoto Y. Ainscow E.K. Rutter G.A. Kimura S. Noda M. Iino M. Kadowaki T. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: E262-E271Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) but acidified insulin granules in RIN insulinoma cells (24Tompkins L.S. Nullmeyer K.D. Murphy S.M. Weber C.S. Lynch R.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: C429-C437Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In mouse β-cells dialyzed in the whole-cell patch configuration, cytosolic ATP was found to promote granule acidification (16Barg S. Huang P. Eliasson L. Nelson D.J. Obermuller S. Rorsman P. Thevenod F. Renstrom E. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2145-2154Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). From experiments using tolbutamide, inhibitors of the vesicular H+-ATPase (v-H+-ATPase), and blockers of Cl− channels, the following model was proposed to explain granule acidification by glucose. By acting on a sulfonylurea-like protein in the granule membrane, ATP (formed from glucose metabolism) could promote Cl− influx into the granule, thereby providing counterions for H+ pumping by the v-H+-ATPase (16Barg S. Huang P. Eliasson L. Nelson D.J. Obermuller S. Rorsman P. Thevenod F. Renstrom E. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2145-2154Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).In the present study, we have used Lysosensor DND-160, a fluorescent probe that, unlike Lysosensor DND-189 used previously, permits ratioing measurement of pH and therefore, decreases potential problems linked to differences in loading or redistribution between cellular compartments (26Lin H.J. Herman P. Kang J.S. Lakowicz J.R. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 294: 118-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). This probe has previously been instrumental to measure stimulus-induced pH changes in lysosomes (27Holopainen J.M. Saarikoski J. Kinnunen P.K. Jarvela I. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 5851-5856Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), in intracellular canaliculi of parietal gastric cells (28Perez J.F. Ruiz M.C. Michelangeli F. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2001; 537: 735-745Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 29Gerbino A. Hofer A.M. McKay B. Lan B.W. Soybel D.I. Gastroenterology. 2004; 126: 182-195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), and in eosinophil granules (30Bankers-Fulbright J.L. Kephart G.M. Bartemes K.R. Kita H. O'Grady S.M. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 5749-5757Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Our aims were to characterize the acute effects of glucose on granular pH in normal mouse islets, to establish the mechanisms of these effects, and to determine whether they are important for insulin secretion, in particular for its regulation via the amplifying pathway. To address the last question, the islets were subjected to experimental maneuvers expected to increase granular pH by distinct mechanisms.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESSolutions and Reagents—The control medium was a bicarbonate-buffered solution containing 120 mm NaCl, 4.8 mm KCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 24 mm NaHCO3, 10 mm glucose, and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. It was gassed with O2/CO2 (94/6) to maintain a pH of 7.4. A similar solution was used as test medium in most experiments after adjustment of the glucose concentration and the addition of the studied substances. When the concentration of KCl was increased to 30 mm, that of NaCl was decreased accordingly. Ca2+-free solutions were prepared by substituting CaCl2 with MgCl2 and the addition of 200 μm EGTA. Cl−-free solutions contained 124.8 mm sodium isethionate, 4.8 mm KHCO3, 3.5 mm calcium acetate, 1.2 mm magnesium acetate, and 19.2 mm NaHCO3. Total CaCl2 was increased to 3.5 mm to maintain the same concentration of ionized Ca2+ as in Cl−-containing solutions (31Hermans M.P. Gerard M. Henquin J.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 889: 262-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The Cl−-free medium with 30 mm K+ contained 118.8 mm sodium isethionate, 24 mm KHCO3, 6 mm potassium gluconate, 3.5 mm calcium acetate, and 1.2 mm magnesium acetate.Diazoxide was a gift from Schering-Plough. Fura PE3-AM, BCECF-AM, and Lysosensor Yellow/Blue DND-160 were obtained from Molecular Probes. Forskolin and PMA were from Calbiochem. All other reagents were from Sigma.Preparations—Islets were aseptically isolated by collagenase digestion of the pancreas of female Naval Medical Research Institute mice (local colony) or, for one experiment, of Sur1 knock-out mice (32Seghers V. Nakazaki M. DeMayo F. Aguilar-Bryan L. Bryan J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9270-9277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar) (provided by J. Bryan, Houston, TX). After hand selection, the islets were cultured for about 18 h at 37 °C in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10 mm glucose, 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (33Jonas J.C. Gilon P. Henquin J.C. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 1266-1273PubMed Google Scholar). Clusters of islet cells were prepared by dispersing islets in a Ca2+-free medium (34Jonkers F.C. Jonas J.C. Gilon P. Henquin J.C. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1999; 520: 839-849Crossref Scopus (98) Google Scholar) and cultured on circular coverslips for 2 days before use. On average, these clusters contain 9-13% of non-β-cells (35Jonkers F.C. Guiot Y. Rahier J. Henquin J.C. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2001; 133: 575-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Control experiments were also performed with insulin-secreting MIN6 cells forming monolayers on glass coverslips or aggregating in pseudoislets (36Hauge-Evans A.C. Squires P.E. Persaud S.J. Jones P.M. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 1402-1408Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar) after culture for 7-8 days in bacteriological Petri dishes (Falcon 351029) that prevent attachment of the cells. The medium was Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing fetal bovine serum, penicillin, and streptomycin as above and was supplemented with 50 μm β-mercaptoethanol.Measurements of [Ca2+]c, pHc, and NAD(P)H—For [Ca2+]c measurements, islets were loaded with the Ca2+ indicator fura-PE3 (2 μm, 2 h at 37°C) in 1 ml of control medium (except where otherwise specified). After loading, the islets were transferred into a chamber mounted on the stage of a microscope and maintained at 37 °C. The fura-PE3 probe was excited at 340 and 380 nm, and emission was captured at 510 nm with a CCD camera. From the ratio of fluorescence (at 340 and 380 nm), [Ca2+]c was calculated by comparison with a calibration curve. Details of the method have been reported elsewhere (4Gilon P. Henquin J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20713-20720Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For measurements of cytosolic pH (pHc), islets were loaded with the pH indicator BCECF (0.5 μm, 2 h at 37 °C) in 1 ml of control medium (except where otherwise specified). They were then examined in the same system as that used for Ca2+, but the probe was excited at 440 and 490 nm, and emission was captured at 535 nm. pHc was calculated by comparison with a calibration curve (37Shepherd R.M. Henquin J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7915-7921Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). For NAD(P)H measurements, islets were preincubated for 2 h at 37°C in 1 ml of control medium (except where otherwise specified) without probe. They were then examined with the same system as above and excited at 360 nm with recording of emitted fluorescence at 470 nm (4Gilon P. Henquin J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20713-20720Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Characteristics and Localization of Lysosensor DND-160—An in vitro calibration curve was constructed by dissolving the probe in 50 mm pyridine buffer with a pH ranging from 4 to 5.5 (steps of 0.1 unit) and measuring the fluorescence emitted at 535 nm upon excitation at 340 and 380 nm. In intact cells, the probe is expected to accumulate in acidic compartments (26Lin H.J. Herman P. Kang J.S. Lakowicz J.R. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 294: 118-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). To assess the intracellular localization of Lysosensor DND-160, secretory vesicles were labeled by expressing a green fluorescent protein fused within the C peptide of proinsulin (Ins-C-GFP) (38Watkins S. Geng X. Li L. Papworth G. Robbins P.D. Drain P. Traffic. 2002; 3: 461-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The Ins-C-GFP virus was prepared and kindly provided by P. Drain (Pittsburgh, PA). Clusters of islet or MIN6 cells on coverslips were infected for 3 h in serum-free RPMI medium, with the virus at a multiplicity of infection of 10 and 2, respectively. After careful washing, they were cultured for 3 days in serum-containing medium. The cells attached to coverslips were then incubated for 2 h at 37°C in 1 ml of control medium containing 2 μm Lysosensor DND-160. After quick rinsing, the preparations were examined on a Zeiss Axioplan microscope equipped with a ×63/1.4 NA oil objective. The DND-160 fluorescence was excited at 365 nm, and the signal emitted above 400 nm was recorded by an Axiocam HRc camera (Zeiss). The GFP fluorescence was excited at 470 nm, and emission was recorded at 540 nm. Because superimposition of blue and green does not yield another color, the DND-160 signal was first digitized, and the blue fluorescence was converted in red. Merging red (converted DND-160) and green (Ins-C-GFP) images then permitted us to identify colocalization by the orange/yellow color.A second approach was also used to measure the uptake of DND-160 in islet cells. Uninfected islet cell clusters were loaded with Lysosensor DND-160 as above. The analysis was then performed on 6-10 clusters of 10-20 cells each and then averaged for each sample. The preparations were excited as above, but the acquisition time by the camera was either preset or variable until the same preset amount of light was recorded, thereby permitting estimation of the amount of probe accumulated by the clusters.Measurements of Granular pH in Islets—Intact islets were loaded with Lysosensor DND-160 (2 μm, 2 h, 37°C) in 1mlof control medium (except where otherwise specified). They were then examined with the same system as that used for [Ca2+]c or pHc measurements. The preparation was excited at 340 and 380 nm, and emission was recorded at 535 nm. Successive images (ratios) were obtained over 0.74 s every 5.5 s. Results are presented as changes in fluorescence (ratio 340/380 nm).Measurements of Insulin Secretion—Cultured islets were preincubated for 2 h at 37 °C in 1 ml of control medium (except where otherwise specified) without probe. Batches of 20 islets were then transferred into chambers of a perifusion system (39Henquin J.C. Nenquin M. Stiernet P. Ahren B. Diabetes. 2006; 55: 441-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The effluent medium was collected at 2-min intervals, and insulin was measured by radioimmunoassay, using rat insulin as a standard and ethanol to precipitate bound insulin (40Heding L.G. Diabetologia. 1972; 8: 260-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar).Presentation of Results—Results are presented as means ± S.E. of the indicated number of experiments (obtained from at least three different cultures). Statistical significance of differences was evaluated by unpaired Student's t test. Multiple comparisons were done by analysis of variance followed by the Student-Newman-Keuls test. p ≤ 0.05 was considered to indicate a significant difference.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONCharacteristics of the pH-sensitive Probe Lysosensor DND-160—The fluorescence of Lysosensor DND-160 was measured in pyridine buffer. When pH was increased from 4.0 to 5.5, the emitted fluorescence (at 535 nm) remained fairly stable upon excitation at 340 nm but progressively decreased upon excitation at 380 nm (Fig. 1A). The calibration curve obtained by ratioing the 340/380 nm signals shows that pH changes can be measured between 4.5 and 5.5 (Fig. 1B). The 380-535 nm signal was very faint above pH 5.5 and not detectable above pH 6.0, indicating that Lysosensor DND-160 cannot report cytosolic pH changes. The intensity of the signal increased with the probe concentration in buffer, but the 340/380 nm ratio was not affected (Fig. 1B, inset). This method of granular pH measurement is thus much more independent of loading differences or probe redistribution, which limit the reliability of non-ratiometric probes such as Lysosensor DND-189.Localization of Lysosensor DND-160 in β-Cells—The localization of Lysosensor DND-160 in β-cells and MIN6 cells was determined by comparison with Ins-C-GFP, a reporter of insulin secretory granules (38Watkins S. Geng X. Li L. Papworth G. Robbins P.D. Drain P. Traffic. 2002; 3: 461-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The two signals exhibited a similar localization in both β-cells (Fig. 2, A and B) and MIN6 cells (Fig. 2, C and D). The punctated distribution of Lysosensor DND-160 (Fig. 2A, inset) was usually more difficult to evidence than that of the green Ins-C-GFP fluorescence, but the areas of high and low signal intensity were similar. Colocalization of Lysosensor DND-160-positive and Ins-C-GFP-positive granules was demonstrated by the orange/yellow color in merged images of a MIN6 cell (Fig. 2, E-H).FIGURE 2Localization of Lysosensor DND-160 in insulin granules of mouse β-cells and MIN6 cells. GFP was expressed in clusters of mouse islet cells and MIN6 cells and targeted to insulin secretory granules by fusion with the C peptide of proinsulin (Ins-C-GFP). The preparations were loaded with 2 μm DND-160 for 2 h before examination (×63 objective). A and B, mouse β-cells. Inset, punctate distribution of DND-160 in a β-cell not expressing GFP (×100 objective). C and D, MIN6 cells.

This was verified by measuring (excitation, 365 nm; emission, >400 nm) the intensity of Lysosensor DND-160 fluorescence in clusters of similar sizes. Fig. 3A shows the fluorescence of a control cluster captured by the camera after 0.6 s of recording. The heterogeneity of cell loading was not exceptional, some cells of a cluster being more or less strongly labeled than the majority (Fig. 3B). This may reflect superimposition of cells or true differences in dye accumulation. When loading with Lysosensor DND-160 was carried out in the presence of concanamycin, an inhibitor of the v-H+-ATPase (41Drose S. Altendorf K. J. Exp. Biol. 1997; 200: 1-8Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), virtually no signal was detected when the recording time of the camera was preset to 0.6 s as for controls (Fig. 3C). With longer recording times (6 s), a diffuse signal could, however, be obtained that was equivalent in intensity to the control signal (Fig. 3D versus Fig. 3A). This is compatible with the dissipation of the pH gradient between acidic organelles and cytoplasm. The intensity of the fluorescence was then automatically measured by the camera in several clusters of a similar size in each preparation and normalized to the signal in control clusters loaded with Lysosensor DND-160 (Fig. 3G). The autofluorescence of non-loaded clusters was only ∼10%, and the specific fluorescence of the probe was decreased by more than 80% by concanamycin and 30 mm NH4Cl (used to alkalinize intracellular vesicles). Importantly, cluster degranulation (by overnight stimulation of insulin secretion with 0.01 μm PMA and 0.5 μm forskolin) also decreased the amount of accumulated probe (Fig. 3, E-G).FIGURE 3Quantification of Lysosensor DND-160 accumulation in islet cell clusters and intact islets. A and B, fluorescence microscopy (×63 objective) of control islet cell clusters loaded with 2 μm Lysosensor DND-160. The images were obtained after the indicated time of recording by the camera.

Conca, concanamycin; Degra, degranulation. H, fluorescence intensity of islets loaded (or not: no dye) with Lysosensor DND-160 and treated as indicated. The fluorescence (excitation, 340 nm; emission, 535 nm) was measured with the same system as in Fig. 1 and subsequently used for all experiments with islets. Values, expressed relative to control islets, are means ± S.E. for nine islets from three preparations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Similar experiments were then performed with intact islets loaded with Lysosensor DND-160 and examined (excitation, 340 nm; emission, 535 nm) with the system that will be used in subsequent experiments. The fluorescence intensity was not significantly affected by 30 min of treatment with 100 nm concanamycin but was decreased by 2 h of treatment with 20 or 100 nm concanamycin (Fig. 3H). A similar time- and concentration-dependent inhibition of fluorescence accumulation was observed with bafilomycin, another inhibitor of the v-H+-ATPase (not shown). Degranulation of the islets, by overnight stimulation of insulin secretion with forskolin and PMA as above, decreased the fluorescence intensity of Lysosensor DND-160 by 72% (Fig. 3H). Under these conditions, the insulin content of the islets was decreased by 88%, from 103 ± 4 to 13 ± 1 ng/islet (20 batches of 10 islets from three experiments). Both changes compare well since a fraction of the residual fluorescence is intrinsic to the islets and seen without dye loading (16% of total). Therefore, the fraction of Lysosensor DND-160 fluorescence originating from compartments other than insulin secretory granules is not a major one. Lysosomes, which also take up Lysosensor DND-"

Here we report the x-ray structures of the transcriptional activator DhaS and the coactivator DhaQ and characterize their function. DhaQ is a paralog of the Dha binding Dha kinase subunit; DhaS belongs to the family of TetR repressors although, unlike all known members of this family, it is a transcriptional activator. DhaQ and DhaS form a stable complex that in the presence of Dha activates transcription of the Lactococcus lactis dha operon. Dha covalently binds to DhaQ through a hemiaminal bond with a histidine and thereby induces a conformational change, which is propagated to the surface via a cantilever-like structure. DhaS binding protects an inverted repeat whose sequence is GGACACATN6ATTTGTCC and renders two GC base pairs of the operator DNA hypersensitive to DNase I cleavage. The proximal half-site of the inverted repeat partially overlaps with the predicted -35 consensus sequence of the dha promoter.

The enzymes of metabolic pathways have by and large been conserved in all kingdoms of life where they occur. In contrast, the mechanisms of pathway control are diverse. This is most obvious at the level of gene expression. The different size, structure, and sequence organization of eukaryotic and prokaryotic genomes necessitate the different control mechanisms. But even between bacteria with similar genome organizations the differences can be striking. The transcription control of dihydroxyacetone kinases is one example for such diversity, as it will be shown below. Dihydroxyacetone (Dha) 4The abbreviations used are: Dha, dihydroxyacetone; PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate; PTS, PEP-dependent carbohydrate: phosphotransferase system; DhaS, transcription activator of the dha operon; DhaQ, coactivator of DhaS; DhaQH6 and DhaSH6, subunits with C-terminal histidine tag; DhaK, Dha binding subunit of the E. coli Dha kinase; DhaL, nucleotide binding subunit; DhaM, phosphotransferase subunit (Dha kinase-specific phosphoryltransfer protein of the PTS); NTA, nitrilotriacetic acid; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; RMS, root mean squared.4The abbreviations used are: Dha, dihydroxyacetone; PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate; PTS, PEP-dependent carbohydrate: phosphotransferase system; DhaS, transcription activator of the dha operon; DhaQ, coactivator of DhaS; DhaQH6 and DhaSH6, subunits with C-terminal histidine tag; DhaK, Dha binding subunit of the E. coli Dha kinase; DhaL, nucleotide binding subunit; DhaM, phosphotransferase subunit (Dha kinase-specific phosphoryltransfer protein of the PTS); NTA, nitrilotriacetic acid; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; RMS, root mean squared. kinases occur in eubacteria, animals, and plants. They can be divided into two families according to the source of high energy phosphate they utilize, ATP and phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) (for a review see Ref. 1Erni B. Siebold C. Christen S. Srinivas A. Oberholzer A. Baumann U. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2006; 63: 890-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The ATP-dependent kinases from animals, plants, and eubacteria consist of a Dha binding and an ATP binding domain. The PEP-dependent forms consist of three protein subunits DhaK, DhaL, and DhaM (2Gutknecht R. Beutler R. Garcia Alles L.F. Baumann U. Erni B. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2480-2486Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). DhaK and DhaL are homologous to the Dha and ATP binding domains and DhaM is homologous to the IIAMan-subunits of the PEP: sugar phosphotransferase system (PTS) (3Nunn R.S. Markovic-Housley Z. Génovésio-Taverne J.C. Flükiger K. Rizkallah P.J. Jansonius J.N. Schirmer T. Erni B. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 259: 502-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 4Siebold C. Flükiger K. Beutler R. Erni B. FEBS Lett. 2001; 504: 104-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). DhaK is a stable homodimer of 35-kDa subunit molecular mass that binds Dha covalently by a hemiaminal linkage between the imidazole nitrogen of a histidine (His-230 in Escherichia coli) and the carbonyl carbon of Dha (5Garcia-Alles L.F. Siebold C. Nyffeler T.L. Flukiger-Bruhwiler K. Schneider P. Burgi H.B. Baumann U. Erni B. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 13037-13045Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 6Siebold C. Garcia-Alles L.F. Erni B. Baumann U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8188-8192Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). DhaL contains a molecule of ADP, which in contrast to the nucleotide of the ATP-dependent kinases is not exchanged but is rephosphorylated in situ by DhaM (7Bachler C. Flukiger-Bruhwiler K. Schneider P. Bahler P. Erni B. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 18321-18325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). DhaM shuttles phosphate from the phosphorylcarrier protein HPr of the PTS to DhaL (2Gutknecht R. Beutler R. Garcia Alles L.F. Baumann U. Erni B. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2480-2486Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). A BLAST analysis with DhaK and DhaL as query revealed genes for DhaK and DhaL homologs, which were associated in operons with the genes for putative transcription factors (1Erni B. Siebold C. Christen S. Srinivas A. Oberholzer A. Baumann U. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2006; 63: 890-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). These genes occur adjacent to the Dha kinase operons suggesting that they control Dha kinase expression. How this works has so far been elucidated only for E. coli (8Bachler C. Schneider P. Bahler P. Lustig A. Erni B. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 283-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Here, the dha operon is controlled by DhaR, a transcription activator from the family of AAA+ enhancer-binding proteins (EBP, Ref. 9Buck M. Gallegos M.T. Studholme D.J. Guo Y. Gralla J.D. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 4129-4136Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). The Dha kinase subunits, DhaK and DhaL are corepressor and coactivator of DhaR. When Dha is present and phosphorylated, DhaL-ADP is formed, which by binding to the DhaR receiver domain stimulates DhaR activity. In the absence of Dha, the ligand-free DhaK subunit (apoDhaK) displaces DhaL from the receiver domain but unlike DhaL does not activate DhaR (8Bachler C. Schneider P. Bahler P. Lustig A. Erni B. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 283-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The transcription control of the dha operon is thus coupled to the enzymatic turnover of the inducer rather than to binding of the inducer alone. This is one example to show how Dha kinase subunits sense Dha and induce their own expression. A second example is provided by the dha operon of Lactococcus lactis IL1403 that has not been characterized before. 5The amino acid sequence of the proteins can be accessed through Swiss Protein Database Swiss-Prot Q9CIW0 (DhaQ), Swiss-Prot Q9CIV9 (DhaS), Swiss-Prot Q9CIV8 (DhaK), Swiss-Prot Q9CIV7 (DhaL), and Swiss-Prot Q9CIV6 (DhaM).5The amino acid sequence of the proteins can be accessed through Swiss Protein Database Swiss-Prot Q9CIW0 (DhaQ), Swiss-Prot Q9CIV9 (DhaS), Swiss-Prot Q9CIV8 (DhaK), Swiss-Prot Q9CIV7 (DhaL), and Swiss-Prot Q9CIV6 (DhaM). This operon (Fig. 1A) for a putatively PEP-dependent Dha kinase and a glycerol-type facilitator is flanked by two genes dhaS and dhaQ. Here we present the x-ray structures of the two subunits DhaS and DhaQ and characterize their function. DhaS belongs to the TetR family of transcription regulators (6Siebold C. Garcia-Alles L.F. Erni B. Baumann U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8188-8192Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). But unlike all known members of this family DhaS of L. lactis functions as an activator and not as a repressor of transcription. DhaQ is a paralog of the DhaK subunit, which in complex with Dha acts as the coactivator of DhaS. Crystallization, Structure Determination, and Refinement of DhaS—For details of protein expression and purification see the supplemental text. Crystals of DhaSH6, a variant of DhaS with a C-terminal histidine tag, were obtained by sitting drop vapor diffusion at 20 °C. The concentrated protein (20 mg/ml) was mixed with buffer containing 50 mm sodium cacodylate pH 6.0, 1.7 m ammonium sulfate, 0.015 m magnesium acetate in a 1:1 ratio. For cryoprotection, 25% glycerol was added in a serial manner. Crystals were frozen in liquid nitrogen. Mercury derivatives with different occupancies were obtained by soaking in 1 mm HgCl2 for three months (derivative 1) and in 0.1 mm HgCl2 for 12 h (derivative 2). To increase the phasing power the selenomethionyl L171M mutant of DhaSH6 was used as an additional derivative. The datasets for the mercury derivatives 1 and 2 and the L171M selenomethionyl derivative were collected at 110 K using a RAXIS-IV imaging plate detector mounted on a Rigaku RU-300 rotating anode x-ray generator (wavelength 1.5418 Å). High resolution diffraction data for the native crystal were collected at the BM14 beamline (wavelength 0.976 Å) of the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (Grenoble, France) employing a MAR Mosaic225 detector (Mar Research, Hamburg, Germany). All datasets were integrated and scaled by XDS (14Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (12999) Google Scholar, 15Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Lebedev A. Wilson K.S. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1999; 55: 247-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1004) Google Scholar). The structure was determined by the MIRAS method. Heavy atom (mercury and selenium) sites were located by SHELXD (10Schneider T.R. Sheldrick G.M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 1772-1779Crossref PubMed Scopus (1570) Google Scholar) and difference Fourier methods. Phasing and solvent flipping were effected using SHARP (11de La Fortelle E. Bricogne G. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 472-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (1796) Google Scholar) and SOLOMON (12Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 1996; 52: 30-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (1138) Google Scholar) resulting in a figure of merit of 0.66 to 2.31 Å resolution for the unmodified map. Automatic model building was achieved using the program ARP/WARP version 6.1.1 (13Perrakis A. Morris R. Lamzin V.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 458-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (2561) Google Scholar). The model was further adjusted and completed using the program O (14Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (12999) Google Scholar) version 9.0.3. Refinement was effected by the program REFMAC (15Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Lebedev A. Wilson K.S. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1999; 55: 247-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1004) Google Scholar). The quality of the model was checked by PROCHECK (16Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). The results of the data collection and processing statistics are given in Table 1. The asymmetric unit of the crystal contains two DhaS monomers (one physiological dimer). The final refined coordinates consist of 178 and 179 residues in the two subunits. More than 95.7% of the residues of the final model fall within the core region and 4.3% of the residues in the allowed region of the Ramachandran plot. Atomic coordinates and structure factor amplitudes have been deposited with the RCSB, with accession codes 2IU4, and 2IU5. Comparison of the three-dimensional structures was done using the DALI server (17Holm L. Sander C.

To prepare DhaQ for cocrystallization with Dha, 2 mm Dha was included in all the buffers used during the purification process. Crystals of the Dha·DhaQ complex were obtained in 0.1 m sodium acetate trihydrate, pH 4.5, 2 m ammonium sulfate. Crystals were cryoprotected by adding glycerol to 25%. The complete datasets of apoDhaQ were collected in-house (wavelength 1.5418 Å) and of the Dha·DhaQ complex at the Swiss Light Source (wavelength 1.2154 Å), PSI, Villigen. The structure of apoDhaQ was solved by molecular replacement using the DhaK structure from E. coli (PDB code 1OI2) and employing the program PHASER (18McCoy A.J. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Storoni L.C.

Open table in a new tab Determination of β-Galactosidase (LacZ) Activity—L. lactis IL1403 transformed with pDKQS, pDKS, and pDK (Fig. 1B) were used for the reporter gene assay. β-Galactosidase activity was determined by the method of Miller (19Griffith K.L. Wolf Jr., R.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 290: 397-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 20Miller J.F. A Short Course in Bacterial Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1992: 72-74Google Scholar). Cultures were grown in M17 medium (Difco) (supplemented with 0.5% glucose, 5 μg/ml chloramphenicol, and 5 mm Dha where indicated) to an A550 of 0.4-0.6 and permeabilized with one drop of toluene and 30 s vortexing. The toluene was evaporated, the permeabilized cells incubated for 5 min at 28 °C, o-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (30 μl of 4 mg/ml in buffer Z to 110 μl of cells) was added to start the reaction, absorbance at 420 nm was monitored continuously in a Spectramax 250 Plate reader and converted into Miller units (MU = 1.81 (−0.015 + 1.86 × A420; this formula includes a correction for omitted alkalization with Na2CO3 and the optical path length in the microtiter plate). The listed LacZ activities are the averaged measurements of at least three independent cultures and assays. DNase I Footprinting, Primer Extension, and Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—For DNase I footprinting the 93-bp intergenic region between dhaS and dhaKLM (Fig. 1) was PCR-amplified as described under supplementary methods. 40,000 cpm of the labeled PCR product were mixed with 3 μm purified wild-type DhaS without a histidine tag in a final volume of 40 μl buffer C (10 mm Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 5 mm MgCl2, 50 mm NaCl, 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) incubated for 20 min at 25 °C. 0.05 units of DNase I (Roche) was added for 30 s at room temperature, and the reaction stopped by the addition of 100 μl of phenol and 200 μl of 0.4 m NaOAc pH 5.0 containing 10 μg/ml herring sperm DNA. Samples were phenol-extracted, ethanol-precipitated, and analyzed on a 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. The same PCR product used for footprinting was also used for EMSA. 10,000 cpm of the end-labeled PCR product were incubated with 50 nm (50% saturation) and 500 nm (100% saturation) of purified DhaS without a histidine tag in 20 μl of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm MgCl2, 50 mm NaCl, and 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. Where indicated 500 nm purified DhaQ and 1 μm Dha were added. After 20 min of incubation at 25 °C, the protein-bound DNA was separated from free DNA by native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (4% polyacrylamide; acrylamide-bisacrylamide 19:1, 150 V, 0.7 h) and visualized by exposure on a phosphor screen. For primer extension total RNA was isolated from L. lactis IL1403 with the Nucleo Spin RNA II Kit (BD Biosciences). The primer P13 annealing to the codons 13-19 of dhaK was 32P end-labeled, and the extension reaction was performed according to the primer extension system protocol of Promega. The primer extension product was analyzed on a 6% denaturing acrylamide gel. Structure Determination and Overall Architecture of DhaS—DhaS with a C-terminal hexahistidine tag was expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) and purified by metal affinity and gel filtration chromatography. The final yield was 35 mg of DhaS per liter of culture (for details, see supplemental information). Details of structure determination and refinement statistics at 1.6 Å resolution are given in Table 1. The asymmetric unit contains two monomers of DhaS forming a wedge-shaped physiological dimer. Both DhaS monomers are well ordered (residues 1-179) except for the first three amino acids in the second and the last amino acid in the first monomer. The DhaS monomer folds into nine α-helices (α1-α9) (Fig. 2A). The DhaS monomer can be divided into an N-terminal DNA binding domain (α1-α3) and a core domain involved in dimerization (α4-α9). The N-terminal helices α2 (residues 25-35) and α3 (residues 40-45), which are almost perpendicular to each other, form the helix-turn-helix DNA binding motif. Helices 5 and 6 (residues 75-99) are separated by a prominent kink of ∼117° between the fifth α-helical turn of helix 5 and the first of helix 6. The C-terminal helices α8 (residues 132 to 156) and α9 (residues 161-178) provide a dimerization interface of 1090 Å2 per monomer, which covers 11% of the subunit surface. It contains 65% hydrophobic, 22% polar and 13% charged amino acids. As indicated by its fold, DhaS belongs to the TetR family of transcriptional regulators (21Ramos J.L. Martinez-Bueno M. Molina-Henares A.J. Teran W. Watanabe K. Zhang X. Gallegos M.T. Brennan R. Tobes R. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2005; 69: 326-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar). A sequence alignment of DhaS with the Staphylococcus aureus multidrug regulator QacR (22Schumacher M.A. Miller M.C. Grkovic S. Brown M.H. Skurray R.A. Brennan R.G.

Biol. 2000; 7: 215-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar) shows invariant residues predominantly in the DNA binding domain (α1-α3) whereas no sequence conservation was found in the core domain. In particular, the residues in positions critical for inducer recognition by the TetR family members (21Ramos J.L. Martinez-Bueno M. Molina-Henares A.J. Teran W. Watanabe K. Zhang X. Gallegos M.T. Brennan R. Tobes R. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2005; 69: 326-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar) are not conserved in DhaS. Overlay of the DhaS and QacR monomers yields an RMS deviation of 4.0 Å for 161 out of 186 Cα, overlay with TetR a rms deviation of 4.2 Å for 134 of 198 Cα (17Holm L. Sander C. Science. 1996; 273: 595-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (1281) Google Scholar). An overlay of the physiological dimers is shown in Fig. 2B. DhaS has a more open core fold and as a consequence the helix-turnhelix motifs are further apart in DhaS than in QacR. The distances between the Cα and Cα′ of Tyr-44 is 63 Å in the DhaS dimer, whereas it is 45 Å in QacR and 37 Å in TetR (not shown). The increased distance between the DNA binding domains of DhaS is caused by the following differences (relative to QacR) (i) different orientations of the core helices, (ii) different orientation of the DNA binding domain relative to the core helix 4, (iii) different angles between the helix axis of α1 (DNA binding domain) and α4 (core), namely −120° in DhaS but only −90° in QacR. Structure Determination of ApoDhaQ and the Dha·DhaQ Complex—DhaQ with a C-terminal hexahistidine tag was expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) and purified by metal affinity and gel filtration chromatography. The final yield was 60 mg of DhaQ per liter of culture (for details, see supplemental information). The structures of the apo-form of DhaQ and the Dha·DhaQ complex were solved by molecular replacement, the apo-form employing the DhaK subunit of E. coli as a search model (6Siebold C. Garcia-Alles L.F. Erni B. Baumann U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8188-8192Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), and the complex using the refined apo-model. Refinement and data collection statistics are given in Table 2. The asymmetric units of both crystal forms contain one physiological dimer. The Cα backbone of the Dha·DhaQ complex is well ordered over its entire length (residues 8-332 and 2′-332′). In the apo-form, however, residues 190-206 and 193′-205′ are disordered (Fig. 3B). The DhaQ monomer can be divided into two domains (Fig. 3A) each composed of a six-stranded sheet (yellow), which is covered by -helices (blue for the first domain, red and green for the second domain). Helices 1 of the first and 9 of the second domain form the dimer interface. An area of 2400 Å2 (27%) of the accessible monomer surface is buried upon dimer formation. Inserted in the second domain is a cantilever like structure consisting of two short β-strands (red, β10 and β11) from which a loop bearing the active site His-215 is suspended (Fig. 3A). In the structure of apoDhaQ, extra electron density in the active site could be assigned to a molecule of glycerol (Fig. 3C), which is present in the crystallization buffer. The OH groups at C1, C2, and C3 are hydrogen-bonded to the side chain of Asp-107, Nϵ2 of His-54, and the main chain amide-hydrogen of Gly-51, respectively (Fig. 3C). In the Dha·DhaQ complex electron density can be assigned to Dha (Fig. 3D). The OH groups at C1 and C3 are hydrogen-bonded to the side chain of Asp-107 and the main-chain amide-hydrogen of Gly-51, respectively. The geminal amino alcohol group at C2 is hydrogen bonded to Nϵ2 of His-54. The carbon backbones of the non-covalently bound glycerol and the covalently bound Dha backbone as well as the hydrogen bonding residues at the topological switch points of the first domain are perfectly superimposable (Fig. 3E). Dha binding initiates a series of movements and conformational rearrangements in and around the active site (Fig. 3, B and E): (i) His-215 is pulled by 1.37 Å toward Gly-51 and by 2.33 Å toward Asp-107. (ii) The imidazole ring of His-215 is rotated around the Cβ-Cγ bond, and as a consequence of this movement the hydrogen bond between Nδ1 and the carboxyl Oϵ1 of Glu-217 is broken. The side chain of Glu-217 is rotated away and the free space is occupied by a sulfate ion, which is present in the crystallization buffer (Fig. 3E). (iii) Following the movement of His-215, the cantilever (red, β10 and β11) is pulled toward the N-terminal domain (blue helices in Fig. 3, A and B). (iv) The residues 190-206 and 193′-205′ that are disordered in apoDhaQ become well ordered upon Dha binding. An extra β-sheet appears as a result of this ordering (β8 and β9, Fig. 3, A and B). (v) The residues 134-140 of the N-terminal domain change their conformation from aperiodic to α-helical (Fig. 3B). All structural alterations appear to critically depend on the covalent binding of Dha, because the non-covalently bound glycerol has no effect. Soaking with Dha makes apoDhaK crystals crack, suggesting that conformational changes are induced by the ligand and that the different space groups assumed are a consequence of the different conformations and not vice versa. For comparison, none of these differences has been noticed with E. coli DhaK (33% sequence identity). In both forms (compare PDB ID 1OI2 and 1OI3, Refs. 6Siebold C. Garcia-Alles L.F. Erni B. Baumann U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8188-8192Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar and 26Siebold C. Arnold I. Garcia-Alles L.F. Baumann U. Erni B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48236-48244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) the residues corresponding to 190-206 remained disordered, the Glu-232 side chain is not rotated away from His-230 and the His-230-Glu-232 pair did not change its orientation. Glu-232 has been proposed to serve as a general base, which by abstracting a proton from Nδ1 of His-230 increases the nucleophilicity of Nϵ3 toward the carbonyl carbon of Dha. The turning away of the carboxylate once Dha is bound may delay reprotonation of Nδ1 and consequently also the (reversible) release of Dha. This delayed release may be important for maintenance of the DhaQ·DhaS·DNA ternary complex in a stable state during transcription initiation. The catalytic efficiency of the DhaK subunit, in contrast, depends on the fast exchange of substrate and product at the Dha binding site. The rigid structure of E. coli DhaK may accelerate the acid/base-catalyzed product dissociation. DhaS and DhaQ Are Positive Regulators of the dha Operon—The dha operon and the dhaS gene are divergently transcribed from a 93-base pair long intergenic region (Fig. 1). To characterize the regulation of the dha operon by DhaS, low copy number plasmids containing the Pdha promoter in front of the lacZ reporter gene and dhaQ and/or dhaS were constructed (Fig. 1B). L. lactis IL1403 transformed with these plasmids were grown in GM17 medium to which Dha was added as the inducer. Dha induced LacZ activity 10-fold (Fig. 4A). Deletion of either the dhaS or the dhaQ gene resulted in the complete disappearance of PdhaK-lacZ reporter gene activity, and the dha operon could no longer be induced with Dha (Fig. 4B). d,l-Glyceraldehyde induced reporter gene activity only 3-fold whereas glycerol, a structural analog of Dha, had no effect (results not shown). Given that DhaS has the fold of a well known transcription factor (TetR) (Fig. 2), and DhaQ is a paralog of the Dha binding subunit of the Dha kinase (Fig. 3) DhaS and DhaQ are activator and coactivator, respectively, of the dha operon. Characterization of the DhaS·DhaQ Complex—The observation that only DhaQ and DhaS together activate transcription suggested that the two subunits might form a complex. And indeed, a stable complex between DhaS and DhaQ could be isolated when two cytoplasmic extracts containing DhaQ with a histidine tag and DhaS without a histidine tag, respectively, were mixed and purified by Ni2+-NTA chromatography (Fig. 5A, inset). The DhaS·DhaQ complex was then separate"

Ib-IX-V complex mediates the initial tethering and rolling of platelets on von Willebrand factor (vWF) localized at the vascular injury site (1Lopez J.A. Blood Coagul.

Haemost. 2001; 86: 178-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Upon ligation with the A1 domain of vWF, the GP Ib-IX-V complex transmits inward a signal that leads to activation of integrin αIIbβ3 and eventual platelet activation and aggregation (3Andrews R.K.

Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2003; 35: 1170-1174Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Although the GP Ib-IX-V complex is widely considered to comprise GP Ibα, GPIbβ, GP IX, and GP V with a 2:2:2:1 stoichiometry (5Berndt M.C. Gregory C. Kabral A. Zola H. Fournier D. Castaldi P.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 151: 637-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 6Du X. Beutler L. Ruan C. Castaldi P.A. Berndt M.C.

Chem. 1992; 267: 364-369Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it is not clear how these subunits assemble into a functional receptor complex in the membrane, partly because intersubunit interactions are largely unknown. Abnormally low expression of the GP Ib-IX-V complex in human platelets can result from mutations in either GP Ibα, GP Ibβ, or GP IX, but not GP V (8Lopez J.A. Andrews R.K. Afshar-Kharghan V. Berndt M.C. Blood. 1998; 91: 4397-4418Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Such phenomena can be reproduced in transfected Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells; missing any of the three subunits leads to no or significantly lowered surface expression of the GP Ib-IX complex (9Lopez J.A. Leung B. Reynolds C.C. Li C.Q. Fox J.E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12851-12859Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Lopez J.A. Weisman S. Sanan D.A. Sih T. Chambers M. Li C.Q. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23716-23721Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, GP V is not required for efficient expression of the GP Ib-IX complex, although there are mixed reports on whether it enhances the complex expression (11Li C.Q. Dong J.F. Lanza F. Sanan D.A. Sae-Tung G. Lopez J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16302-16307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 12Calverley D.C. Yagi M. Stray S.M. Roth G.J. Blood. 1995; 86: 1361-1367Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been shown in transfected cells that the GP Ib-IX complex assembles in the endoplasmic reticulum before being transported as a single entity to the plasma membrane. Failure of proper complex assembly results in prompt degradation of GP Ibα in the lysosome and accumulation of nonnative GP IX inside the cell (13Lopez J.A. Li C.Q. Weisman S. Chambers M. Blood. 1995; 85: 1254-1258Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Dong J.F. Gao S. Lopez J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31449-31454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Although the interdependence among the subunits in the GP Ib-IX complex is well documented, the underlying reasons are not clear. The requirement of all three subunits to efficient surface expression of the complex posits the importance of intersubunit interactions to the proper assembly and therefore stability of the receptor complex. Based on the effects of mutations in GP Ibβ on the expression level of GP IX, the N-terminal cysteine knot region in GP Ibβ was suggested to mediate the interaction with GP IX (15Kenny D. Morateck P.A. Montgomery R.R. Blood. 2002; 99: 4428-4433Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). It helps to explain the dependence of GP IX expression on GP Ibβ. Why the expression of GP Ibα is dependent on GP Ibβ and/or IX nonetheless remains unclear. The transmembrane (TM) domains of GP Ibα and IX may be important to efficient surface expression of the GP Ib-IX complex. Deletion of either the extracellular or cytoplasmic domain of GP Ibα does not significantly affect complex expression in transfected cells (16Li C.Q. Dong J.F. Lopez J.A. Thromb. Haemost. 2002; 88: 673-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 17Dong J.F. Li C.Q. Sae-Tung G. Hyun W. Afshar-Kharghan V. Lopez J.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12421-12427Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Consistently, the Ibα extracellular domain, but not the combined extracellular and TM domains, can be replaced with counterparts from the interleukin-4 receptor while maintaining reasonable expression level of the receptor complex (18Kanaji T. Russell S. Ware J. Blood. 2002; 100: 2102-2107Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). In addition, a single-site mutation in the IX TM domain was recently identified to cause decreased expression of the GP Ib-IX-V complex in a patient (19Wang Z. Zhao X. Duan W. Fu J. Lu M. Wang G. Bai X. Ruan C. Thromb. Haemost. 2004; 92: 606-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). It is not evident, however, whether the Ibβ TM domain is as important as its counterparts in GP Ibα and IX. No mutations within the Ibβ TM domain have been reported to prevent surface expression of the receptor complex, although a nonsense mutation effectively removing the entire TM and cytoplasmic domains of GP Ibβ has (20Kunishima S. Matsushita T. Ito T. Kamiya T. Saito H. Am. J. Hematol. 2002; 71: 279-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). We report in this paper a study focusing on the TM domains of the GP Ib-IX complex. We found that replacing the Ibβ TM domain with unrelated sequences produced the largest effect, in comparison with TM replacements in GP Ibα and GP IX, on surface expression of the GP Ib-IX complex in transfected CHO cells. We have also identified single-site mutations in the Ibβ TM domain that significantly decrease the complex expression by affecting the stability of GP Ibα, suggesting that these mutations affect the interaction between GP Ibβ and Ibα. In particular, our data suggest an interaction between residue Ser503 in the Ibα TM domain and His139 in the Ibβ TM domain, which helps to explain the requirement of GP Ibβ for efficient expression of GP Ibα. Materials—The vector pDX was used in earlier studies on expression of the GP Ib-IX complex in CHO cells (9Lopez J.A. Leung B. Reynolds C.C. Li C.Q. Fox J.E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12851-12859Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Lopez J.A. Weisman S. Sanan D.A. Sih T. Chambers M. Li C.Q. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23716-23721Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The CHO K1 cell line was obtained from ATCC. WM23, an anti-Ibα monoclonal antibody, was kindly provided by Dr. M. Berndt. Other antibodies against individual subunits of the GP Ib-IX complex, including FMC25, SZ1, SZ2, AK2, and Gi27, were purchased from Axxora (San Diego, CA), Beckman Coulter, Chemicon, or Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-actin antibody was purchased from Sigma. Domain Replacement and Mutagenesis of TM Domains of the GP Ib-IX Complex—The mammalian expression vectors pDX containing Ibα, Ibβ, or IX cDNAs (9Lopez J.A. Leung B. Reynolds C.C. Li C.Q. Fox J.E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12851-12859Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Lopez J.A. Weisman S. Sanan D.A. Sih T. Chambers M. Li C.Q. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23716-23721Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were used in this study. To replace the predicted TM domain in each subunit with poly-leucine (pL) or poly-leucine-alanine (pLA) sequences (Fig. 1), unique restriction sites on both sides of the TM domain in the target cDNA were established by silent mutations using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene). In pDX-Ibα, the pDX vector containing the Ibα cDNA, a BspEI restriction site was introduced to a site around residue Pro481 (upstream of the TM domain) with primer 5′-AATGACCCTTTTCTCCATCCGGACTTTTGCTGCCTCC-3′ and its complementary primer. After two endogenous XbaI sites were removed sequentially with the primers 5′-GGAGAGCGTCTAGGCCGATGCCCTTGAG-3′ (for the site in the pDX vector) and 5′-TGGTCCACTGCTTCTCTGGACAGCCAAATGCCC-3′ (for the site in the Ibα gene around residue Leu318) and their respective complementary primers, the unique XbaI site was created around residue Leu521 (downstream of the TM domain) with primer 5′-CATGTGAAACCACAGGCTCTAGACTCTGGCCAAGGTGC-3′ and its complementary primer. In pDX-Ibβ, a SacI site was introduced at residues Glu111-Leu112 with primer 5′-TATCTGGCCGAGGACGAGCTCCGCGCCGCTTGC-3′ and its complementary primer. After the endogenous SalI site at residues Val30-Asp31 was removed with primer 5′-CCGCCTTCCCTGTAGACACAACCGAGCTGG-3′ and its complementary primer, the unique SalI site was created around residue Arg149 with primer 5′-GGTGCTGCTGCTGTGTCGACTGCGGAGGCTGCG-3′ and its complementary primer. Due to the high GC content of the Ibβ cDNA, mutagenesis was carried out in buffers containing 5% dimethyl sulfoxide. In pDX-IX, an XmaI site around residue Pro52 was removed with primer 5′-CCTTCAGTCCGTGCCCCCTGGAGCCTTTGACCACC-3′ and its complementary primer, making the remaining XmaI site around residue Pro130 unique. After the endogenous XbaI site in the pDX vector was removed with primer 5′-GGAGAGCGTCTAGGCCGATGCCCTTGAG-3′ and its complementary primer, a unique XbaI site was created around residue Leu160 with primer 5′-GCCACCACAGAGGCTCTAGATTGAGCCAGGCC-3′ and its complementary primer. Transfection of the resulting pDX vectors into CHO cells produced the GP Ib-IX complex at a level that is indistinguishable from the original vectors (data not shown). To replace the TM domain, the gene fragment encoding the pL or pLA sequence was synthesized, digested with suitable restriction enzymes, and ligated into the target vector that had been predigested and devoid of the endogenous TM-encoding sequence. Similarly, site-specific mutations were generated first in the TM-encoding DNA fragment by PCR, which was then digested with suitable restriction enzymes and ligated into the target vector. All of the gene sequences were confirmed by DNA sequencing (SeqWright, Houston, TX). Transient Transfection of CHO Cells—Transient transfection of CHO cells with pDX vectors containing GP Ibα, GPIbβ, and GP IX genes was carried out using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) as described earlier (10Lopez J.A. Weisman S. Sanan D.A. Sih T. Chambers M. Li C.Q. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23716-23721Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, CHO K1 cells were evenly split into 12 wells of the cell culture plate (Corning) and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) with 10% fetal bovine serum to 90% confluence prior to transfection. The cells in each well were washed gently, treated with 1 ml of reduced serum medium (Invitrogen), and transfected with a total of 1.5 μg of vectors (0.5 μg of each vector) that had been incubated in suspension with Lipofectamine in reduced serum medium for 20 min at room temperature. When only one or two subunit genes were to be transfected, empty pDX vector was included to keep the total amount of DNA a constant. The transfection lasted for 6 h under standard culture conditions before the medium containing the DNA/Lipofectamine mixture was replaced by 1 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. The cells were then grown for 2-3 days before being harvested and analyzed for protein expression. SDS-Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis and Western Blot—Transiently transfected cells were harvested and washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin (BSA). Approximately 5 × 105 cells from each transfection were mixed thoroughly with 60 μl of cell lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 5 mm CaCl2, 5 mm N-ethylmaleimide, 58 mm sodium borate, pH 8.0) containing 10% (v/v) protease inhibitor mixture for mammalian tissues (Sigma) and incubated at room temperature for 10 min. Supernatant from the cell lysate was separated from the insolubles by centrifugation at 15,600 × g for 4 min at room temperature. To ensure equal loading, the total protein concentration in each supernatant was also checked using the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). Supernatant containing ∼10 μg of total protein was mixed with standard Tris-glycine SDS sample buffer (pH 6.8), separated in a 4-12% Bis-Tris NuPAGE SDS gel (Invitrogen), transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and immunoblotted with appropriate antibodies. Antibody binding was detected by adding peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and chemiluminescence substrates (PerkinElmer). Finally, the membrane was either exposed to BioMax XAR film (Eastman Kodak Co.) or quantitated using a ChemiGenius2 Bio-Imaging system (Syngene, Frederick, MD). To quantify the relative intensity of the blotted bands, the density of each Ibα or Ibβ band was measured with automatic background correction, divided by the density of the corresponding actin band, and finally normalized against the value of the wild type bands from αβIX cells. Flow Cytometry—Surface expression levels of GP Ibα and IX were analyzed by flow cytometry as described recently (21Peng Y. Berndt M.C. Cruz M.A. Lopez J.A. Blood. 2004; 104: 3971-3978Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Briefly, the transfected cells were detached with 0.48 mm EDTA and washed with ice-cold PBS. Resuspended in the PBS/BSA buffer, the cells were incubated with 2 μg/ml primary antibody for 1 h at room temperature, washed twice with PBS/BSA, and stained with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated rabbit antimouse IgG (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) for 1 h at room temperature. After a final wash with PBS/BSA to remove unbound antibody, the cells were examined in a Beckman-Coulter Epics XL flow cytometer. To quantitate the data, the mean fluorescence value of the entire cell population (10,000 cells) was normalized, with the value of αβIX cells being 100% and that of pDX cells 0%. Since this study addresses mostly the mutational effects on surface expression of the GP Ib-IX complex in transfected CHO cells, it is critical that changes in expression be attributed only to the mutations. To minimize bearings of extrinsic factors such as antibiotic selection pressure on protein synthesis in the cell, transient transfection was employed throughout this study. After transfection, the cells were grown for an additional 2-3 days, and expression levels of GP Ibα as well as GP IX were measured with two methods: Western blot of the transfected cell lysate for overall expression and flow cytometry analysis for surface expression. Furthermore, uniform transfection efficiency in a given experiment was achieved by the transfection of wild type or mutant Ibα, Ibβ, and IX cDNAs in equal amounts and at the same time to cultured CHO cells evenly split in 6-12 wells of a culture plate (see “Experimental Procedures” for details). When one subunit was omitted from the transfection, the sham vector was included to keep the total DNA amount a constant. Finally, in Western blot experiments, lysates derived from equal number of transfected cells (as evidenced by actin blotting) were always from the same transfection experiment, thereby correlating the band intensity of blotted target protein within a single gel with only the mutations in the GP Ib-IX complex. Although the transfection efficiency is the same in any given experiment, it could vary from experiment to experiment. To enable a meaningful comparison of surface expression levels obtained from different experiments, CHO cells transfected with sham pDX vectors (pDX cells) and those transfected with wild type Ibα, Ibβ, and IX subunits (αβIX cells) were included in each transfection experiment. The surface expression levels of mutant complex were then quantified by the mean fluorescence value of the entire cell population (10,000 cells) and normalized, with the value of αβIX cells being 100% and that of pDX cells 0%. Therefore, the normalized surface expression level can be attributed to only the mutations in the target subunit. It is important to note that although the normalized mean fluorescence value correlates positively with the surface expression level, such correlation is not necessarily a linear one. In other words, a 30% normalized value does not necessarily mean that the number of mutant receptors on the cell surface is 30% of that of wild type. Replacing the TM Domains of GP Ibα and GP Ibβ, but Not That of GP IX, with an Unrelated Sequence Decreases Complex Expression in CHO Cells—Since a TM domain is physically restricted to the membrane bilayer, it can interact only with other TM domains in a complex. If in the target TM domain there is a sequence motif that mediates TM-TM interaction and contributes to complex assembly and eventual surface expression, then replacing the entire TM domain with an irrelevant sequence, such as the pL or pLA sequence, should remove the motif. Both pL- and pLA-containing peptides form a stable TM α-helix in the lipid bilayer (22de Planque M.R. Goormaghtigh E. Greathouse D.V. Koeppe 2nd, R.E. Kruijtzer J.A. Liskamp R.M. de Kruijff B. Killian J.A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 5000-5010Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Considered generic and “featureless” TM sequences, they have been used to replace the TM region in various studies (23Gurezka R. Laage R. Brosig B. Langosch D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9265-9270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 24Choma C. Gratkowski H. Lear J.D. DeGrado W.F. Nat. Struct.

Biol. 2000; 7: 154-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). Given the intrinsic difference between the pL and pLA sequences, at least one of them, if not both, should remove the interaction motif in the target TM domain. To test which TM domain in the GP Ib-IX complex is necessary for its efficient surface expression, we replaced the TM domains, one at a time, with the pL and pLA sequences and measured their effects on complex expression in transfected CHO cells. Residues Leu487-Leu510 in GP Ibα except for Pro488 near the N-terminal end of the TM domain were replaced by either the pL or pLA sequence (Fig. 1A). Residues Gly124-Leu147 in GP Ibβ and Val136-Leu153 in GP IX were likewise replaced. The TM-replaced cDNA were then transiently transfected into CHO cells together with cDNA encoding the other two wild type subunits. In this paper, CHO cells are designated by the transfected subunits, with the subscript of each subunit describing the mutation within. Lack of subscript indicates the wild type subunit. For example, αpLβIX cells denote the CHO cells transfected by the Ibα subunit with the pL TM domain along with wild type Ibβ and IX subunits. The effects of TM replacement mutations on complex expression in the cell were first characterized through immunoblotting of GP Ibα and IX from cell lysates (Fig. 1B). GP Ibα was blotted with two monoclonal antibodies that target different regions; both produced the same results. In comparison with wild type αβIX cells, the Ibα expression levels were notably reduced in αpLβIX and αpLAβIX cells. They were even lower in αβpLIX and αβpLAIX cells. In contrast, no significant change in Ibα expression was observed in αβIXpL and αβIXpLA cells. GP IX was blotted with a polyclonal antibody, and the IX expression levels in various transfected cells were consistent with those of GP Ibα. The surface expression levels of GP Ibα and IX in CHO cells containing TM-replacement mutations were measured by flow cytometry and further quantitated with the mean fluorescence values (Fig. 2). Partly transfected cells (αβ, αIX, and βIX cells) were included as controls, and they produced GP Ibα or GP IX on the cell surface at a level significantly lower than αβIX cells, consistent with the finding that all three subunits are required for efficient surface expression of the GP Ib-IX complex (9Lopez J.A. Leung B. Reynolds C.C. Li C.Q. Fox J.E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12851-12859Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Lopez J.A. Weisman S. Sanan D.A. Sih T. Chambers M. Li C.Q. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23716-23721Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that the surface expression level of GP Ibα or GP IX is not the same in these partly transfected cells; αβ cells expressed significantly more GP Ibα than αIX cells, and βIX cells expressed more GP IX than αIX cells. Of all of the TM replacement mutant cells, αβpLIX and αβpLAIX cells had the lowest surface expression levels of GP Ibα and IX, with ∼6% of the mean fluorescence value of αβIX cells. The expression levels in αpLβIX and αpLAβIX cells were slightly higher than αβpLIX cells but remained much lower than αβIX cells. In contrast, surface expression in αβIXpL cells was indistinguishable from the wild type. The expression levels in αβIXpLA cells were significantly lower, with the mean fluorescence value being ∼45% of the wild type value. Overall, surface expression of the Ibα and IX subunits was remarkably consistent with their overall expression in the cell. These results showed that replacing the TM domains of GP Ibα or GP Ibβ, but not that of GP IX, with an unrelated sequence led to a marked decrease in expression of the GP Ib-IX complex, suggesting the importance of the Ibα and Ibβ TM domains in the complex assembly. TM-replacing Mutations Affect Formation of the Disulfide Bond between GP Ibα and GP Ibβ—The disulfide bond between GP Ibα and Ibβ is located very close to the TM domains. To test whether TM replacement mutations affect formation of this intersubunit disulfide, cell lysates were resolved in a SDS gel under nonreducing conditions and subsequently blotted for GP Ibα (Fig. 3). In αβIX cells, the dominant band corresponded to GP Ib (i.e. Ibα-Ibβ), revealing the intersubunit disulfide. Little or no GP Ib band was observed in αpLβIX, αpLAβIX, αβpLIX, and αβpLAIX cells, indicating that formation of the intersubunit disulfide was affected when either the Ibα or Ibβ TM domain was replaced with an unrelated sequence. It is interesting to note that the Ib band was wild type-like in αβIXpL cells but was notably diminished in αβIXpLA cells. This suggested that replacing the IX TM domain with the pLA sequence, but not the pL sequence, may interfere with the Ibα-Ibβ disulfide formation. Moreover, in some mutant cells in which the Ibα-Ibβ disulfide was largely absent, most of GP Ibα formed intermolecular disulfide(s) with unidentified protein(s) in a complex with an apparent molecular mass larger than 220 kDa (Fig. 3). Its molecular weight is consistent with that of a Ibα homodimer, which was reported in CHO cells expressing only GP Ibα (26Kanaji T. Hamasaki N. Izuhara K. Ware J. Blood. 2004; 104: 434aCrossref Google Scholar). In short, our results indicated that the Ibα and Ibβ TM domains are important to formation of the membrane-proximal disulfide between the two subunits. Replacing either TM domain with an unrelated sequence may disrupt the interaction between the two domains, resulting in removal of the disulfide and formation of new disulfides involving GP Ibα. The role of the IX TM domain in formation of the Ibα-Ibβ disulfide remained a question, since ambiguous results were obtained when it was replaced with unrelated sequences. Site-specific Mutations in the Ibβ TM Domain Affect Stability of GP Ibα and the Complex Expression—To guard against the caveat that decrease in the GP Ib-IX complex expression by TM replacement is due to the input of the pL or pLA sequence rather than disruption of the intrinsic property of the native TM domains, we proceeded to identify site-specific mutations within the TM domains that affect surface expression of GP Ib-IX complex. Given its largest effect by TM replacement, we focused on the Ibβ TM domain. Since the replacement of TM domain with the pL sequence is essentially the replacement of all of the non-Leu residues with Leu residues, certain non-Leu residues should be important to the interaction with GP Ibα and efficient surface expression of the receptor complex. The α-helical structure of a TM domain dictates that its residues interacting with another TM α-helix be located on the same helical interface. To screen quickly for the site-specific mutations, we divided the residues in the Ibβ TM domain into seven “sides,” each of which represents one side of the TM α-helix and was assigned arbitrarily as side a-g (Fig. 4A). All of the non-Leu residues on each side, one at a time, were changed to Leu (Fig. 4B). Each of the seven corresponding mutant subunits, denoted as βpLa to βpLg, was then co-transfected transiently with wild type Ibα and IX subunits into CHO cells. The expression levels of individual subunits in mutant cells were measured and expressed as a percentage of those of the wild type counterparts in αβIX cells. Of the seven side mutations, three (sides a, b, and f) resulted in significantly lowered expression of GP Ibα in the cell (Fig. 4C). The side b mutation, in particular, resulted in the lowest expression level of GP Ibα. The relative expression levels of GP Ibβ and IX in some mutant cells were also affected, but they did not correlate with the Ibα expression levels. Although αβpLcIX and αβpLdIX cells produced similar amounts of GP Ibβ in the cell (59 and 61% of the expression level in αβIX cells, respectively), a marked difference in their expression of GP Ibα was evident (69 and 96% of the Ibα expression level in αβIX cells, respectively) (Fig. 4C). In the three mutant cells in which GP Ibα expression was decreased, the Ibβ expression level, relative to the wild type, was substantially higher than the Ibα level. For instance, the levels of GP Ibα and GP Ibβ in αβpLbIX cells were 15 and 81%, respectively, of those in αβIX cells. This indicated that the Ibα expression was not limited by the decreased expression of GP Ibβ. Rather, the decrease in Ibα expression was probably due to the decrease in Ibα stability as a result of the destabilized interaction between GP Ibα and GP Ibβ. In contrast to t"

SHP-1 and SHP-2 share over 55% sequence identity and are regulated by similar mechanisms. However, their biological functions are quite different (1Neel B.G. Gu H. Pao L. Trends Biochem.

SHP-1 also dephosphorylates receptors of growth factors, cytokines, and antigens, and tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins associated with these receptors, and therefore, it is often defined as a negative signal transducer. SHP-2, on the other hand, is generally considered as a positive signal transducer. Functional knock-out of the Shp-2 gene in the mouse causes death of embryos at mid-gestation (13Saxton T.M.

However, there are data suggesting a positive role of SHP-1 in growth signaling as revealed by overexpression of a catalytically inactive Cys-to-Ser mutant of SHP-1 (16Su L. Zhao Z. Bouchard P.

In this study, we employed small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) to knock down the expression of SHP-1 and SHP-2 in a single cell system, and we analyzed the effects on EGF-induced cell signaling.

Cell Culture, Transient Transfection, Stimulation, and Lysis— We used colorectal adenocarcinoma Caco-2 cells to study the role of SHP-1 and SHP-2 in growth factor signaling. These cells express both of the phosphatases and respond well to EGF stimulation. The cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal bovine serum. The cells were transiently transfected with SHP-1 and SHP-2 siRNAs (Ambion) or pSuper RNA interference constructs in the presence of Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's protocol. After transfection, the cells were cultured for 48 h in a complete medium and then in a serum-free medium for 16 h before stimulation with 50 ng/ml EGF for various periods of time. After washing with cold phosphate-buffered saline three times, the cells were lysed in a cell lysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 50 mm NaF, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm p-aminophenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, and 1% (w/v) Non-idet P-40 buffer. The lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—For immunoprecipitation, cell lysates (1.5 mg of protein/ml) were pre-cleaned by protein A/G-Sepharose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and then incubated with primary antibodies bound to protein A/G-Sepharose at 4 °C. After extensive washing with the aforementioned cell extraction buffer, proteins in the immunoprecipitates were separated on SDS gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The membranes were blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin and then probed with specific primary antibodies followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat secondary antibodies. Detection was made by using the ECL system (Amersham Biosciences). Expression of a GST Fusion Protein Carrying the SHP-2-binding Motifs of Gab1—Tyr-657 and Tyr-689 of Gab1 are known to be the binding sites for SHP2 (24Cunnick J.M. Mei L. Doupnik C.A. Wu J. J. Biol.

A C-terminal fragment (amino acids 635-724) of Gab1 that carries these two sites was expressed in Escherichia coli cells as a GST fusion by using the pGex-2T vector. Tyrosine phosphorylation of the fusion protein was achieved by co-expressing an active form of c-Src in E. coli cells as we described for PZR in our earlier studies (25Zhao R. Fu X. Teng L. Li Q. Zhao Z.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 42893-42898Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The protein was purified by using glutathione-Sepharose. The nonphosphorylated and phosphorylated fusion proteins were designated GST-Gab1CT and GST-pGab1CT, respectively. GST Fusion Protein Pulldown Assays—To study the interaction of SHP-1 with SHP-2, GST and GST-SHP-2 immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose were incubated with purified MBP and MBP-SHP-1 at 4 °C for 1 h in a binding buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.1 mm EDTA, and 100 mm NaCl. To investigate the interaction of Gab1 with SHP-1 or SHP-2, GST-Gab1CT and GST-pGab1CT were immobilized on glutathi-one-Sepharose and incubated with purified SHP-1 or SHP-2 in the above buffer system. After extensive washing with the binding buffer, bound and unbound materials were separated on SDS gels and visualized by Coomassie Blue staining or Western blotting analyses. Suppression of SHP-1 and SHP-2 Expressions by siRNAs— Many previous studies on the role of SHP-1 and SHP-2 in cell signaling have employed overexpressing dominant negative mutants and fibroblast cells derived from knock-out mice. Although overexpression of dominant negative mutants may have nonspecific effects, the knock-out cells express truncated forms of the enzymes (1Neel B.G. Gu H. Pao L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 284-293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (971) Google Scholar). The RNA interference technique has been widely used to study the loss-of-function phenotype of genes. In this study, we first employed commercially available double strand RNAs to knock down the expression of SHP-1 and SHP-2 in Caco2 cells. Results are shown in Fig. 1. SHP-1 siRNA specifically suppressed the expression of SHP-1 by 80% but had no effect on that of SHP-2. Conversely, the siRNA of SHP-2 specifically knocked down the expression of SHP-2 by 70% but left SHP-1 intact. We also examined the protein levels of GAPDH and ERK1/2 to confirm that they were not affected by the siRNAs. The data suggest that these siRNAs worked very efficiently to suppress the expression of SHP-1 and SHP-2. This provides an excellent system to study the function of these enzymes in parallel. Knockdown of SHP-1 or SHP-2 Reduces EGF-induced Activation of ERK1/2 but Not of Akt—We treated the cells with EGF and analyzed the activation of downstream signaling pathways. We employed phospho-specific antibodies to determine the activation of ERK1/2 and Akt. As shown in Fig. 2, knockdown of either SHP-1 or SHP-2 significantly reduced the activation of ERK1/2. The magnitude of ERK1/2 activation was reduced by about 60%. These data are very similar to those observed with cells overexpressing dominant negative mutants of SHP-1 or SHP-2 (16Su L. Zhao Z.

Thus, it furthers the positive role of both enzymes in EGF-induced ERK activation. We also analyzed the activation of Akt by using phospho-specific Akt antibodies. Interestingly, knockdown of either enzyme showed no significant effects on Akt. This suggests that SHP-1 and SHP-2 specifically regulate EGF activation of the ERK1/2 pathway but not that of Akt. To rule out possible nonspecific effects of the siRNA oligonucleotides, we also employed vector-based siRNAs to knock down the expression of SHP-1 and SHP-2. The data shown in Fig. 3 demonstrated that the siRNA constructs also caused specific suppression of SHP-1 or SHP-2 expression and decreases in the EGF-induced activation of ERK1/2.FIGURE 3Verification of the specific effects of SHP-1 and SHP-2 knockdowns on EGF-induced activation of ERK1/2 by using vector-based siRNAs. Caco2 cells were transfected with empty pSure-neo vector or constructs carrying SHP-1 or SHP-2 siRNAs as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Cells were serum-starved and then stimulated with 50 ng/ml EGF for the indicated periods of time.

This is particularly true for SHP-1 and SHP-2 because both enzymes stay largely inactive in cytosol because of their internal suppressed structures (27Hof P. Pluskey S. Dhe-Paganon S. Eck M.J. Shoelson S.E. Cell. 1998; 92: 441-450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar, 28Yang J. Liu L. He D. Song X. Liang X. Zhao Z.J. Zhou G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6516-6520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). It is believed that they are activated by binding to tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins (1Neel B.G. Gu H. Pao L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 284-293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (971) Google Scholar). A major binding protein of SHP-2 involved in growth signaling is Gab1, an adaptor protein that undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation upon EGF stimulation (29Nishida K. Hirano T. Cancer Sci. 2003; 94: 1029-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Binding of SHP-2 to Gab1 has been well documented. However, whether SHP-1 has a similar property is not clear. We thus performed immunoprecipitation to examine the interaction of SHP-1 and SHP-2 with Gab1. As shown in Fig. 4, SHP-2 was indeed co-immunoprecipitated with Gab1. Interestingly, SHP-1 was also found in the immunocomplex. The association of both SHP-1 and SHP-2 with Gab1 was markedly enhanced upon EGF stimulation. As with the activation of other signaling events, this association is transient. It peaked at 3 min and declined thereafter. Taken together, these biochemical analyses suggest that both SHP-1 and SHP-2 are linked to the EGF signaling pathway through Gab1. SHP-2 Directly Interacts with SHP-1 and Mediates the Interaction of SHP-1 with Gab1—As an SH2 domain-containing protein, it is not surprising that SHP-1 also binds Gab1. The question is whether SHP-1 and SHP-2 affect each other in binding to Gab1. To address this issue, we repeated the above immunoprecipitation experiments with cells that had either SHP-1 or SHP-2 knocked down. Intriguing results emerged that showed distinct functions of SHP-1 and SHP-2. Although knockdown of SHP-1 had no effect on the association of SHP-2 with Gab1, knockdown of SHP-2 totally blocked the interaction of SHP-1 with Gab1 (Fig. 5). This suggests that SHP-2 likely mediates the interaction of SHP-1 with Gab1. The C-terminal portion of Gab1 contains two SHP-2-binding sites that resemble the so-called immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motifs found in many inhibitory receptors (29Nishida K. Hirano T. Cancer Sci. 2003; 94: 1029-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). It has been known that both SHP-1 and SHP-2 can bind to these motifs through their SH2 domains (1Neel B.G. Gu H. Pao L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 284-293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (971) Google Scholar). To verify that the association of SHP-1 with Gab1 is not through their direct interaction, we performed binding assays with purified proteins. For this purpose, a C-terminal fragment of Gab1 (amino acids 635-724) that carries the two SHP-2-binding sites was expressed in E. coli cells as a GST fusion protein. When co-expressed in E. coli cells with c-Src as described for PZR in our earlier studies (25Zhao R. Fu X. Teng L. Li Q. Zhao Z.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 42893-42898Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), the fusion protein was heavily phosphorylated on tyrosine. The phosphorylation presumably occurs on the SHP-2-binding sites because the Gab1 part of the fusion protein contains only two tyrosyl residues, and GST per se could not be phosphorylated (25Zhao R. Fu X. Teng L. Li Q. Zhao Z.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 42893-42898Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). After immobilization on glutathione-Sepharose beads, the phosphorylated fusion protein GST-pGab1CT, but not the nonphosphorylated GST-Gab1CT, readily pulled down purified SHP-2. In contrast, neither could pull down SHP-1 (Fig. 6). These data indicate that SHP-1 does not directly bind to Gab1 through the mechanism used by SHP-2. One natural question then is whether SHP-2 carries SHP-1 to Gab1. We thus analyzed the co-immunoprecipitation of SHP-1 and SHP-2. Indeed, SHP-1 and SHP-2 formed a constitutive complex that was not affected by EGF stimulation (Fig. 7A). To prove a direct interaction between these two enzymes, we also performed in vitro pulldown assays with purified enzymes. As shown in Fig. 7B, a GST fusion protein of SHP-2 specifically pulled down an MBP fusion protein of SHP-1. In control experiments with GST or MBP alone, no binding was found. Additional experiments showed that GST-SHP-2 also effectively pulled down SHP-1 expressed as a nonfusion protein (data not shown). This provides evidence that SHP-1 and SHP-2 directly interact with each other. Because the SHP-1 and SHP-2 fusion proteins purified from E. coli cells were not phosphorylated, this interaction of SHP-1 and SHP-2 apparently does not involve tyrosine phosphorylation.FIGURE 6Direct binding of SHP-2 but not SHP-1 to tyrosine-phosphorylated Gab1. Nonphosphorylated GST-Gab1CT and phosphorylated GST-pGab1CT were immobilized onto glutathione-Sepharose beads and then incubated with purified SHP-1 and SHP-2. Proteins bound to the beads were analyzed by Western blotting with antibodies against SHP-1, SHP-2, phosphotyrosine, and GST.

An irrelevant rabbit IgG was used as controls. B, GST and GST-SHP-2 immobilized onto glutathione-Sepharose beads were incubated with purified MBP or MBP-SHP-1. Proteins bound to the beads and remained in supernatants were analyzed by Western blotting with an anti-SHP-1 antibody.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) SHP-1 has been generally considered as a negative signal transducer, essentially as an antagonist of SHP-2. This study suggests that this is a misconception. One of the reasons for such a misconception may be because studies on SHP-1 and SHP-2 to date were performed separately without due attention to their interaction. Our present results obtained with cells (Caco 2) expressing both SHP-1 and -2 demonstrate that like SHP-2 SHP-1 is also required for growth factor-induced activation of ERK1/2. Most importantly, we have demonstrated a direct interaction of SHP-1 and SHP-2, implying that SHP-1 plays a complicated role in regulating the function of SHP-2. In Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila, there is only one SH2 domain-containing tyrosine phosphatase that has an essential role in embryonic development (30Gutch M.J. Flint A.J. Keller J. Tonks N.K. Hengartner M.O. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 571-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 31Perkins L.A. Larsen I. Perrimon N. Cell. 1992; 70: 225-236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Mammals have two such enzymes. It should not be surprising that they have complementary roles in cell signaling. Although SHP-1 is highly expressed in hematopoietic cells, it is also widely expressed in other cell types. In fact, the expression of SHP-1 is controlled by two mutually exclusive cis promoters in the Shp-1 gene that give rise to either hematopoietic or nonhematopoietic form of SHP-1 (32Banville D. Stocco R. Shen S.H. Genomics. 1995; 27: 165-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). These two forms differ only in the first three amino acid residues at the N terminus, and they presumably have similar activity and functions. In many nonhematopoietic cells (e.g. Caco 2 cells), the level of SHP-1 and SHP-2 appears to be comparable. The role of SHP-1 in immuno-response has been clearly demonstrated by the phenotype of motheaten and viable motheaten mice, which bears natural mutation of SHP-1. At the biological function level, the concept of SHP-1 as a negative regulator mainly comes from the fact that the SHP-1 deficient mice have enhanced proliferation of hematopoietic cells (except for the red cell lineage) and that their lymphocytic cells exhibit hyper-response to antigens (1Neel B.G. Gu H. Pao L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 284-293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (971) Google Scholar, 2Tsui H.W. Siminovitch K.A. Souza L. Tsui F.W.L. Nat. Genet. 1993; 4: 124-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar, 3Shultz L.D. Schweitzer P.A. Rajan T.V. Yi T. Ihle J.N. Matthews R.J. Thomas M.L. Beier D.R. Cell. 1993; 73: 1445-1454Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). At the cell signaling level, the negative role of SHP-1 is attributable to its ability to cause dephosphorylation of growth factor and cytokine receptors and associated tyrosine kinases. However, it should be noted that SHP-2 also dephosphorylates growth factor receptors, but it enhances rather than inhibits the downstream signal transduction (33Zhao R.J. Zhao Z.J. Biochem. J. 1999; 338: 35-39Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We believe that the intensity of signal transduction activation may not be proportional to the level of tyrosine phosphorylation of upstream receptors at a steady state but to the dynamics of the phosphorylation. Of course, the site of phosphorylation also matters. Therefore, SHP-1 should not be viewed as a negative signal transducer simply because it dephosphorylates growth factor receptors. Our present study suggests SHP-1 and SHP-2 have a similar function in EGF signaling and that their roles are not redundant. They rely on each other to regulate cell signaling. In this regard the present results may also have therapeutic implications because diseases associated with loss-of-function of one enzyme can be treated by inhibiting the other enzyme. By knocking down the expression of SHP-1 and SHP-2, our study also suggests that SHP-1 and SHP-2 specifically regulate the ERK1/2 pathway but not the Akt pathway. The detailed mechanism by which SHP-1 and SHP-2 regulate EGF-induced ERK activation remains unknown. It may not be a simple dephosphorylation of phosphorylated EGF receptor by SHP-1 or SHP-2. The ERK activation signaling pathway consists of upstream components Grb2, SOS, Ras, Raf, and MEK. Grb2 functions by directly binding to growth factor receptors or other associated adaptor proteins (e.g. Gab1 and SHC) thereby recruiting SOS. In turn, SOS activates Ras, which leads to activation of the downstream cascade Raf/MEK/ERK1/2. SHP-2 is known to be required for maintaining normal levels of Ras activation. Ras is activated by guanine nucleotide exchange factor SOS but inactivated by GTPase-activating protein GAP. One scenario that SHP-2 promotes the ERK activation pathway is to prevent activation of GAP by dephosphorylating the phosphorylation site responsible for recruitment and activation of GAP. As a phosphatase, SHP-1 may play a similar role. In all, SHP-1 and SHP-2 presumably function by dephosphorylating some key components of the signaling pathways thereby facilitating signal transduction. However, their physiological substrates have not been clearly defined. This may be due to the transient nature of phosphorylation of these substrates that makes its detection and quantification difficult. Signal transduction is carried through formation of multiple signaling complexes involving adaptors and scaffold proteins. The Gab family adaptor proteins are scaffolding adaptor molecules that display sequence similarity with Drosophila DOS (daughter of sevenless), which is initially identified as a substrate for Corkscrew, the SHP-2 homolog in Drosophila, and they contain a pleckstrin homology domain and binding sites for SH2 and SH3 domains, thereby recruiting various signaling proteins (29Nishida K. Hirano T. Cancer Sci. 2003; 94: 1029-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Studies in multiple systems have implicated that Gab1 has a critical role in signaling via many growth factors and cytokine receptors. Gab1-deficient mouse embryos die in utero with multiple defects in placental, heart, skin, and muscle development similar to phenotypes observed in mice lacking signals of EGF, platelet-derived growth factor, and hepatocyte growth factor pathways (34Holgado-Madruga M. Emlet D.R. Moscatello D.K. Godwin A.K. Wong A.J. Nature. 1996; 379: 560-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar). Binding of SHP-2 with Gab1 has been well defined and is believed to be critical for Gab1-mediated signal transduction, and Gab1 mutants lacking SHP-2-binding sites are unable to activate ERK1/2 and downstream transcription factors (24Cunnick J.M. Mei L. Doupnik C.A. Wu J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24380-24387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 29Nishida K. Hirano T. Cancer Sci. 2003; 94: 1029-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). In fact, a major function of SHP-2 is to dephosphorylate the GAP-binding sites on Gab1 thereby disengaging GAP and sustaining Ras activation (35Montagner A. Yart A. Dance M. Perret B. Salles J.P. Raynal P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 5350-5360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Our study suggests that SHP-1 also binds to Gab1 but through SHP-2. Participation of both SHP-1 and SHP-2 in the Gab1 signaling complex presumably provides more versatility and flexibility for cells to control signal transduction. First, interactions of SHP-1 and SHP-2 may affect each other's catalytic activity. Second, SHP-1 and SHP-2 may have different substrate specificity and thus preferentially act on different proteins. Even with shared substrates, they may have different catalytic efficiencies (19Zhao Z. Bouchard P. Diltz C.D. Shen S.H. Fischer E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2816-2820Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Zhao Z. Larocque R. Ho W.T. Fischer E.H. Shen S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8780-8785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together, a fine-tuning of cell signaling can be achieved by increasing or decreasing the activity of either SHP-1 or SHP-2."
https://openalex.org/W2024952058,"c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) is a member of the mitogenactivated protein kinase family. It has become clear that JNK does not only have a role in induction of stress responses but also in processes such as cell movement. In this report we demonstrate that JNK activity is necessary for platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-BB-induced chemotaxis of primary foreskin fibroblasts and in other cell types. PDGF-BB stimulation was found to lead to activation of JNK with a maximum after 30 min. Inhibition of JNK reduced Ser178 phosphorylation of the focal adhesion component paxillin. Paxillin phosphorylation at this site has been shown to be involved in the dynamics of focal adhesions and consequently cell migration. Moreover, we observed localization of JNK to the actin-dense membrane ruffles induced by PDGF-BB stimulation both using immunofluorescence staining and green fluorescent protein-tagged JNK. This suggests a role for JNK at the leading edge of the cell compatible with a function in cell migration. Furthermore, we show that phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase), which has an established role in PDGF-stimulated cell migration, is necessary for PDGF-induced activation of JNK. In conclusion, JNK is a critical component downstream of PI 3-kinase that may be involved in PDGF-stimulated chemotaxis presumably by modulating the integrity of focal adhesions by phosphorylating its components. c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) is a member of the mitogenactivated protein kinase family.

The PDGF family consists of four protein chains that form five biologically active dimers (PDGF-AA, -AB, -BB, -CC, and -DD) (1Fredriksson L. Li H. Eriksson U. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2004; 15: 197-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar). PDGF isoforms exert their cellular effects via binding to two tyrosine kinase receptors, i.e. PDGFRα that binds PDGF-A, -B, and -C chains, and PDGFRβ that binds PDGF-B and -D chains. Ligand binding induces dimerization and autophosphorylation of PDGFRs. Phosphorylated tyrosine residues function as docking sites for signal transduction proteins with SH2 domains (2Pawson T. Nature. 1995; 373: 573-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (2229) Google Scholar). Proteins interacting with PDGFRs include SHP2, PI 3-kinase, Src family kinases, Grb2, and Shc (3Heldin C.H. Westermark B. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 1283-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (1978) Google Scholar). PDGF stimulates cell proliferation and has also been shown to be a chemoattractant for several cell types including fibroblasts, smooth muscle cells, neutrophils, and monocytes (reviewed in Ref. 4Ronnstrand L. Heldin C.H. Int. J. Cancer. 2001; 91: 757-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Cell migration is a complex process that in a simplified view can be broken down into four major parts; first the cell extends a protrusion in the direction of movement (lamellipodium), second the lamellipodium attaches to the substratum by forming focal adhesions, third the contractile force of the actin cytoskeleton moves the cell body, and finally the rear of the cell detaches from the surface. Perturbations in any of these processes will result in defective cell migration. The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family is evolutionary conserved and all eukaryotic cells possess multiple MAPK pathways. The MAPK family can be subdivided into three major groups, i.e. extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk), p38, and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). JNK is activated by many different factors, including epidermal growth factor, PDGF, transforming growth factor-β, tumor necrosis factor, in addition to cellular stress (5Kyosseva S.V. Int. Rev. Neurobiol. 2004; 59: 201-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). There is an increasing amount of evidence placing MAPKs in a central position for cell migration (6Huang C. Jacobson K. Schaller M.D. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 4619-4628Crossref PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar). However, the requirement for specific MAPKs appears to vary depending on cellular system and chemoattractant used. One possibility is that coordinated spatial and temporal activities of different types of MAPK are needed for correct migration, but the relative contributions may differ between cell types. JNK has frequently been suggested to have essential roles in inflammation, differentiation, and apoptosis (7Barr R.K. Bogoyevitch M.A. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2001; 33: 1047-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 8Ip Y.T. Davis R.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 205-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (1382) Google Scholar). Moreover, there is accumulating data indicating a role for JNK in cell migration. In fact, inhibition of JNK reduces migration in several cell types (9Kavurma M.M. Khachigian L.M. J. Cell Biochem. 2003; 89: 289-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 10Huang C. Rajfur Z. Borchers C. Schaller M.D. Jacobson K. Nature. 2003; 424: 219-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that JNK regulates migration by phosphorylating paxillin, which is a component of the focal adhesions (10Huang C. Rajfur Z. Borchers C. Schaller M.D. Jacobson K. Nature. 2003; 424: 219-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). Expression of a mutant form of paxillin (S178A) that cannot be phosphorylated by JNK significantly reduced the ability of the cell to migrate in a cell culture wound healing assay. There are data indicating a role for JNK in PDGF-mediated migration of vascular smooth muscle cells (11Ioroi T. Yamamori M. Yagi K. Hirai M. Zhan Y. Kim S. Iwao H. J. Pharmacol. Sci. 2003; 91: 145-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), human adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells (12Kang Y.J. Jeon E.S. Song H.Y. Woo J.S. Jung J.S. Kim Y.K. Kim J.H. J. Cell Biochem. 2005; 95: 1135-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), and osteoblastic cells (13Mehrotra M. Krane S.M. Walters K. Pilbeam C. J. Cell Biochem. 2004; 93: 741-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanism by which JNK mediates chemotaxis has not been described. In the present study, we investigated the role of JNK in PDGF-BB-mediated chemotaxis using primary foreskin fibroblasts (AG01523) but also PDGFRβ transfected porcine aortic endothelial (PAE) cells and two glioblastoma cell lines (T98G and A172). Our results show that JNK is activated by PDGF-BB in a PI 3-kinase-dependent manner and is essential for chemotaxis. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that PDGF-BB stimulation results in Ser178 phosphorylation of paxillin in a JNK-dependent manner. In addition, we could detect JNK in the actin-dense membrane ruffles at the leading edge of the cell. We propose that JNK may be a down-stream effector of PI 3-kinase important for PDGF-induced cell migration, possibly through paxillin Ser178 phosphorylation.

Primary antibodies were used at concentrations and buffers recommended by the suppliers and incubated overnight in the cold. After washing, the membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG antibodies (both from Amersham Biosciences), and proteins were visualized using ECL Western blotting detection systems from either Roche Applied Science on a cooled charge-coupled device (CCD) camera (Fuji, Minami-Ashigata, Japan). For detection of total amount of proteins after analysis of phosphorylation status, membranes were stripped with 0.4 m NaOH for 10 min at room temperature, blocked, and incubated with the corresponding antibodies. Chemotaxis—A chemotactic response was assayed using a 96-well microchemotaxis chamber (NeuroProbe, Gaithersburg, MD). A polycarbonate membrane (polyvinylpyrrolidone-free, pore size, 8.0 μm) was coated with 50 μg/ml fibronectin (BD Biosciences) before use. PDGF-BB was added to the lower chamber, and cells were added to the upper chamber at 3 × 104 cells/well. After 4 h, non-migratory cells on the upper membrane surface were mechanically removed, and the cells that had traversed and spread on the lower surface of the filter were fixed and stained with Giemsa. The migrated cells were quantified with cooled CCD camera (Fuji, Minami-Ashigata, Japan). Experiments were performed in quadruplicate. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—AG01523 foreskin fibroblasts grown on glass coverslips were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde and then permeabilized in 0.2% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline for 5 min. Cells were then blocked by incubation for 1 h in 10 mm glycine, pH 7.4, at room temperature, and then incubated with 5% fetal bovine serum and JNK antibody overnight at 4 °C. The slides were then washed three times, incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated phalloidin (Sigma) and either TRITC-conjugated swine anti-rabbit IgG antibody or TRITC-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG antibody for 1 h at room temperature, and then washed again three times. GFP was detected by its autofluorescence. Coverslips were mounted on glass slides using Fluoromount-G (Immunkemi, Sweden), and to visualize the fluorescence, a Zeiss microscope was used. Effect of Low Molecular Weight Inhibitors on PDGF-mediated Chemotaxis—To elucidate the mechanism(s) by which PDGF induces chemotaxis, we investigated the involvement of various kinases in this process employing a panel of low molecular weight kinase inhibitors. Analysis of PAE/PDGFRβ cells using a 96-well microchemotaxis chamber revealed that inhibition of the Erk pathway (PD98059), Src family kinases (SU6656), or protein kinase C (Calphostin C) had no significant effect on chemotaxis (Fig. 1A). In contrast, inhibition of PI 3-kinase (LY294002), p38 (SB203580), or JNK (L-JNKI1) MAP kinases displayed an efficient inhibition (Fig. 1A). PI 3-kinase and p38 have been reported to have important roles in chemotaxis (16Wennstrom S. Siegbahn A. Yokote K. Arvidsson A.K. Heldin C.H. Mori S. Claesson-Welsh L. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 651-660PubMed Google Scholar, 17Wennstrom S. Hawkins P. Cooke F. Hara K. Yonezawa K. Kasuga M. Jackson T. Claesson-Welsh L. Stephens L. Curr.

Chem. 1999; 274: 13954-13960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Notably, if PDGF was placed in both the upper and lower chamber at equal concentration there was no cell migration through the membrane, suggesting that we indeed measured chemotaxis and not chemokinesis (data not shown). To assess whether the effect of MAP kinase inhibition was cell type specific, we performed a similar experiment using primary human fibroblasts (AG01523). Also in these cells, inhibition of p38 or JNK (l-JNKI1 and SP600125) resulted in complete loss of chemotaxis, whereas interference with the Erk MAP kinase pathway did not have as dramatic effect (Fig. 1B). Also in primary fibroblasts, inhibition of PI 3-kinase inhibited chemotaxis. It is interesting to note that for the AG01523 fibroblasts, 10% fetal calf serum was not chemotactic. In conclusion, our data suggest that also JNK has an important role in PDGF-induced chemotaxis. JNK Inhibitors as Well as Dominant-negative JNK Reduce PDGF-BB-induced Chemotaxis—To strengthen our finding that JNK plays a central role in PDGF-mediated chemotaxis, we performed a dose-response study using SP600125, which is a competitive ATP inhibitor selective for JNK on primary human AG01523 fibroblasts. Fig. 2A shows that this inhibitor interferes with chemotaxis in a dose-dependent manner. Similar results were obtained using another JNK inhibitor denoted l-JNKI1 (Fig. 2B), which is an inhibitory peptide that interferes with the interaction between JNK and substrates. Thus, using two inhibitors that target JNK through distinct mechanisms, i.e. blocking kinase activity or interfering with the substrate interaction, we could demonstrate dose-dependent reductions in chemotaxis. Neither of these inhibitors had any significant effect on the low level of migration observed in the absence of ligand (data not shown). Because chemical inhibitor may have nonspecific effects we also investigated the role of JNK in PDGF-mediated cell migration using adenoviral constructs expressing a dominant-negative form of JNK. We infected AG01523 fibroblasts with adenoviruses encoding GFP-tagged wild-type JNK (Ad-JNK), dominant-negative JNK (Ad-JNK-DN), or GFP (Ad-GFP). All constructs were readily expressed, and we observed a significant inhibition of PDGF-induced chemotaxis in the presence of Ad-JNK-DN but not in the presence of Ad-JNK or Ad-GFP (Fig. 2C), supporting our findings with the chemical inhibitors. PDGF-BB Activates the JNK Pathway in a PI 3-Kinase-dependent Manner—To further investigate the role of JNK in PDGF-mediated chemotaxis, we next sought to define how PDGF induces JNK activation. We first characterized the time course of JNK activation following PDGF-BB stimulation. As shown in Fig. 3, JNK phosphorylation increased with time and peaked at 30 min of PDGF-BB stimulation. Since we and others (16Wennstrom S. Siegbahn A. Yokote K. Arvidsson A.K. Heldin C.H. Mori S. Claesson-Welsh L. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 651-660PubMed Google Scholar, 17Wennstrom S. Hawkins P. Cooke F.

Indeed, inhibition of PI 3-kinase interfered with PDGF-BB-mediated JNK activation (Fig. 4). In summary, activation of JNK downstream of PDGFRβ occurs with relatively slow kinetics and requires, at least in part, PI 3-kinase activity.FIGURE 4PI 3-kinase is essential for PDGF-BB-stimulated JNK activation. AG01523 fibroblasts were serum-starved overnight and treated with SP600125, L-JNK-I1, LY294002, or wortmannin at the concentrations indicated for 1 h before stimulation with 20 ng/ml PDGF-BB for 30 min at 37 °C. Total cell lysates (TCL) were prepared and separated on SDS-PAGE and transferred onto Immobilon-P membranes. Immunoblotting was performed using phospho-JNK1/2, total JNK1/2 as indicated. The intensities of the bands were measured and the ratio between phospho-JNK (p-JNK), and total JNK is indicated.

(10Huang C. Rajfur Z. Borchers C. Schaller M.D. Jacobson K. Nature. 2003; 424: 219-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar) have indicated a role for JNK-mediated paxillin phosphorylation in regulation of focal adhesion dynamics and hence cell migration. Therefore, we investigated the effect of JNK inhibition on PDGF-induced paxillin phosphorylation. Indeed, we observed a dose-dependent reduction in PDGF-BB-induced paxillin Ser178 phosphorylation after treatment with SP600125 (Fig. 5). In conclusion, PDGF-BB stimulation regulates JNK-dependent Ser178 phosphorylation of paxillin. JNK Co-localizes with Actin-dense Membrane Ruffles in PDGF-BB-stimulated Cells—To shed further light on the function of JNK in PDGF-mediated chemotaxis, we performed immunofluorescence staining for JNK in AG01523 fibroblasts. We observed a general staining of JNK throughout the resting cells (Fig. 6D). After PDGF-BB stimulation JNK staining was seen in the actin dense membrane ruffles (Fig. 6B, C, E, and F). In addition, we observed an increased nuclear JNK staining, as expected (Fig. 6E). Moreover, we infected AG01523 fibroblasts with adenoviruses encoding GFP-tagged JNK (Ad-JNK) or GFP (Ad-GFP) and analyzed the subcellular localization of these proteins after PDGF-BB stimulation. We found that GFP-JNK was localized to the membrane ruffles after PDGF-BB stimulation (Fig. 7, B, C, E, and F). In contrast, GFP alone where distributed throughout the cell irrespectively of PDGF-BB stimulation (Fig. 7, G-L).FIGURE 7GFP-tagged JNK co-localizes with actin-dense membrane ruffles induced by PDGF-BB. AG01523 fibroblasts were infected with adenoviruses encoding GFP-JNK or GFP 48 h prior to the experiment. Cells were stimulated with 20 ng/ml PDGF-BB for 30 min before staining for filamentous actin (A, B, G, and H) and visualization of the GFP autofluorescence (D, E, J, and K). C, F, I, and L are enlargements of B, E, H, and K, respectively. One representative experiment is shown out of two performed.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) JNK Is Required for Migration of Glioblastoma Cell Lines—To investigate the generality of our finding, we determined whether JNK activity is also essential for migration of glioblastoma cells. Therefore, we analyzed the migration of T98G and A172 cells toward PDGF-BB in the presence or absence of SP600125. As shown in Fig. 8, both cell lines migrated toward PDGF-BB, and we could detect robust inhibition of migration in the presence of SP600125. Both glioblastoma cell lines had a tendency to migrate in the absence of PDGF-BB in the lower chamber. This migration could be blocked by STI-571 or SP600125 (Fig. 8) and is possibly due to the presence of an autocrine loop involving PDGF isoforms. Hence, JNK activity is critical for PDGF-BB-induced chemotaxis also in two glioblastoma cell lines. The pathways that mediate the chemotactic response of PDGFRs are complex and not fully understood at the molecular level. Several studies have implicated phospholipase Cγ1, PI 3-kinase and p38 MAP kinase (reviewed in Ref. 4Ronnstrand L. Heldin C.H. Int. J. Cancer. 2001; 91: 757-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have identified JNK MAP kinase as an important component in the machinery regulating chemotaxis in AG01523 fibroblasts and two glioblastoma cell lines in response to PDGF-BB. In agreement with earlier results, we could show that PI 3-kinase and p38 are also involved in this process. Using two distinct types of JNK inhibitors, SP600125, a competitive ATP inhibitor, and L-JNKI1, a peptide inhibitor blocking binding between JNK and substrates, we could demonstrate a dose-dependent inhibition of chemotaxis. In an in vitro kinase assay using SP600125, the IC50 for MKK4 was reported to be ten times greater than that of JNK (0.4 and 0.04 μm, respectively), whereas other kinases had a significantly larger IC50 values (>25-fold) (20Bennett B.L. Sasaki D.T. Murray B.W. O'Leary E.C. Sakata S.T. Xu W. Leisten J.C. Motiwala A. Pierce S. Satoh Y. Bhagwat S.S. Manning A.M. Anderson D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13681-13686Crossref PubMed Scopus (2228) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that SP600125 also to some degree inhibits MKK4 which is an upstream activator of JNK. As is the case with all inhibitor studies there is also a possibility that other pathways are affected. Therefore, we confirmed our results by expressing an adenoviral construct encoding a dominant-negative form of JNK in AG01523 fibroblasts. Persistent activation of JNK has been correlated with the induction of apoptosis, whereas transient activation may have other functions depending on which other pathways are activated in the cell (7Barr R.K. Bogoyevitch M.A. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2001; 33: 1047-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). In line with this notion, we observed a transient phosphorylation of JNK in response to PDGF-BB. The kinetics of JNK phosphorylation was relatively slow with a peak phosphorylation after 30 min; in comparison, the other MAP kinases Erk and p38 are maximally activated within 2-5 min after PDGF-BB stimulation (21Kallin A. Demoulin J.B. Nishida K. Hirano T. Ronnstrand L. Heldin C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 17897-17904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Interestingly, we detected the strongest immunostaining of JNK in the actin-dense membrane ruffles after 30 min of PDGF-BB stimulation, which coincides with the peak activation of JNK. Similar results were obtained using adenoviral mediated expression GFP-tagged JNK. These results suggest that active JNK is localized to the actin ruffles at the cell edge. Next we attempted to define the molecular mechanism by which JNK is activated downstream of PDGFRβ. In a recent study from Marinissen et al. (22Marinissen M.J. Chiariello M. Tanos T. Bernard O. Narumiya S. Gutkind J.S. Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 29-41Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), RhoA was demonstrated to activate JNK through the action of ROCK. However, this pathway appears not to be involved in PDGF-BB-mediated JNK activation, since a ROCK inhibitor did not block JNK activation (data not shown). It has been reported that for some receptor systems PI 3-kinase is important for JNK activation, possibly through activation of Rac or Cdc42 (23Kam A.Y. Chan A.S. Wong Y.H. J. Neurochem. 2004; 89: 391-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 24Timokhina I. Kissel H. Stella G. Besmer P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6250-6262Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated the role of PI 3-kinase in the PDGF-BB-induced JNK activation. Indeed, inhibition of PI 3-kinase, using two different chemical inhibitors, i.e. LY294002 and wortmannin, abolished the PDGF-BB-mediated JNK phosphorylation. Thus, JNK may be an important component downstream of PI 3-kinase involved in chemotactic signaling. The role of JNK in cell migration is not clear, but one suggestion is that JNK phosphorylates the focal adhesion component paxillin and thereby controls cell movement (10Huang C. Rajfur Z. Borchers C. Schaller M.D. Jacobson K. Nature. 2003; 424: 219-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). In agreement with the study from Huang et al. (10Huang C. Rajfur Z. Borchers C. Schaller M.D. Jacobson K. Nature. 2003; 424: 219-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar), we observed that also PDGF-BB-mediated phosphorylation of Ser178 in paxillin was dependent of JNK activity. In addition, we observed localization of JNK in actin-dense membrane ruffles, suggesting a role for JNK at the leading edge of the cell, which is rich in focal contacts necessary for forward propulsion. It is likely that perturbation of the focal adhesion dynamics will have severe affects on the ability of the cell to migrate. Therefore one may speculate that JNK may exert it role in cell migration by modulating focal adhesion integrity, e.g. by phosphorylating key components such as paxillin. Moreover, it has been suggested that c-Jun is necessary for PDGF-induced migration of vascular smooth muscle cells (11Ioroi T. Yamamori M. Yagi K. Hirai M. Zhan Y. Kim S. Iwao H. J. Pharmacol. Sci. 2003; 91: 145-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Similarly, c-Jun is also involved in the migration of keratinocytes (25Li G. Gustafson-Brown C. Hanks S.K. Nason K. Arbeit J.M. Pogliano K. Wisdom R.M. Johnson R.S. Dev. Cell. 2003; 4: 865-877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). In the latter case it was shown that c-Jun was required to establish an autocrine loop of epidermal growth factor stimulation needed for cell migration. It is possible that JNK contributes to PDGF-induced cell migration through regulation of gene expression, since we found that blocking protein synthesis using cycloheximide inhibited chemotaxis of AG01523 fibroblasts toward PDGF-BB (data not shown). Hence, it appears that JNK have functions required for cell migration in actin ruffles, and possibly also in the production of new proteins, either by controlling gene transcription or translation of preexisting mRNA. Glioblastoma multiforme is an aggressive human brain tumor for which currently no efficient treatment exists. One characteristic of the glioblastoma tumor is that it invades surrounding brain tissue (26Demuth T. Berens M.E. J. Neurooncol. 2004; 70: 217-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). Moreover, glioblastomas often have autocrine loops involving PDGF isoforms (27Betsholtz C. Nister M. Rorsman F. Heldin C.H. Westermark B. Mol. Chem. Neuropathol. 1989; 10: 27-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), which may contribute to the invasive phenotype. Interestingly, we observed an inhibition of the PDGF-BB-stimulated chemotaxis in two glioblastoma cell lines after inhibition of JNK. Thus, inhibition of JNK activity might be a strategy to reduce the invasive properties of glioblastoma tumors. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that JNK is a critical component in the cell migration machinery employed by PDGFRβ in several cell types. We show that PI 3-kinase activity is necessary for PDGF-BB-mediated JNK activation leading to its translocation to the nucleus but also to actin-dense membrane ruffles. In addition, the focal adhesion component paxillin is phosphorylated on Ser178 in a JNK-dependent manner after PDGF-BB stimulation. Thus JNK may directly modulate the integrity of focal adhesions and in this way affect cell migration. We thank Dr. Lars Rönnstrand and Dr. Ann-Sofi Johansson for critically reading this manuscript.

Based on computer analysis, Tom40 is predicted to exist as a β-barrel within the mitochondrial outer membrane (31Court D.A. Lill R. Neupert W. Can. J.

However, computer predictions differ regarding the number and position of the β-strands. Furthermore, there are conflicting reports about the proportion of the protein that exists as β-sheet as well as the position of the β-strands within the protein. When yeast or rat Tom40 was expressed in Escherichia coli, purified, and refolded from inclusion bodies (26Hill K. Modell K. Ryan M. Dietmeier K. Martin F. Wagner R. Pfanner N. Nature. 1998; 395: 516-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar, 35Suzuki H. Kadowaki T. Maeda M. Sasaki H. Nabekura J. Sakaguchi M. Mihara K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 50619-50629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), measurements of β-sheet content by circular dichroism studies were in the range of 60%. In contrast, when Tom40 was purified directly from N. crassa mitochondria, only about 30% β-sheet content was detected (9Ahting U. Thieffry M. Engelhardt H. Hegerl R. Neupert W. Nussberger S. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1151-1160Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). More recently, computer predictions of transmembrane β-strands and circular dichroism spectra of renatured Tom40 from both yeast and N. crassa suggested a β-sheet content of 36 and 40%, respectively, for the two proteins (34Becker L. Bannwarth M. Meisinger C. Hill K. Model K. Krimmer T. Casadio R. Truscott K.N. Schulz G.E. Pfanner N. Wagner R. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 353: 1011-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Although computer predictions of the location of β-strand in Tom40 suggest that the transmembrane domains are generally distributed throughout the protein, a comparison of preprotein binding to full-length rat Tom40 and a truncated version of the protein led to the suggestion that the β-barrel preprotein conducting pore was formed only by the C-terminal half of Tom40 (35Suzuki H.

In addition to its structural role as the pore-forming component of the TOM complex, Tom40 has been shown to have several other functions that are important for the process of importing mitochondrial preproteins. Cross-linking studies have suggested that Tom40 is involved in the binding of preproteins on both the cytosolic (cis) and inter-membrane space (trans) sides of the outer membrane (36Rapaport D. Neupert W. Lill R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18725-18731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The protein also has a chaperone-like function that prevents aggregation of non-native preproteins to facilitate their movement through the translocation pore (37Esaki M. Kanamori T. Nishikawa S. Shin I. Schultz P.G. Endo T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 988-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Furthermore, isolated TOM complex is capable of transferring a mitochondrial presequence into the translocation pore. Tom40 is probably responsible for this process because the same transfer can be achieved by a protease-treated version of the complex, which consists mainly of Tom40 (38Stan T. Ahting U. Dembowski M. Künkele K.-P. Nussberger S. Neupert W. Rapaport D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4895-4902Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In addition to its roles in the function of the TOM complex, Tom40 must also contain information for its own specific targeting to mitochondria and for its assembly into the TOM complex. Tom40 follows a complex pattern of assembly into the TOM complex (30Taylor R. McHale B. Nargang F.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 765-775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 39Model K. Meisinger C. Prinz T. Wiedemann N. Truscott K.N. Pfanner N. Ryan M.T. Nat. Struct.

The incoming monomer binds to the cytosolic side of the TOM complex and is then translocated to the intermembrane space side of the outer membrane where it associates with the Tim8/Tim13 and/or Tim9/Tim10 complexes (41Hoppins S.C. Nargang F.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 12396-12405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 42Wiedemann N. Truscott K.N. Pfannschmidt S. Guiard B. Meisinger C. Pfanner N. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 18188-18194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The monomer then progresses to association with the TOB/SAM complex resulting in a 250-kDa intermediate (43Wiedemann N. Kozjak V. Chacinska A. Schönfisch B. Rospert S. Ryan M.T. Pfanner N. Meisinger C. Nature. 2003; 424: 565-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). The TOB/SAM complex inserts Tom40 into the outer membrane where it associates with another molecule of Tom40 and Tom5 to form a 100-kDa assembly intermediate. Further association with Tom6, Tom7, Tom22, and additional molecules of Tom40 give rise to the fully assembled 400-kDa TOM core complex. This pathway of assembly first described in fungal systems seems to be generally conserved in human mitochondria (33Humphries A.D. Streimann I.C. Stojanovski D. Johnston A.J. Yano M. Hoogenraad N.J.

Cell. 2004; 7: 61-71Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar), play a role in assembly of Tom40 following interaction with the TOB/SAM complex. Thus, efficient assembly of Tom40 requires interaction with several assembly factors as well as different subunits of the TOM complex. It is clear that Tom40 fulfills many functions and has interactions with several proteins. Past investigations have shown that it may be possible to assign roles to various residues or regions of the protein that are responsible for one or more of these functions. The observation that a single amino acid change in the primary sequence of Tom40 affected only transfer of preproteins to the TIM23 complex, but not to the TIM22 complex, suggested that Tom40 plays an active role in sorting proteins to the next mitochondrial translocase (47Gabriel K. Egan B. Lithgow T. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2386-2390Crossref Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a series of conserved residues near the N and C termini of the protein have been shown to be required for Tom40 assembly but not for receptor recognition (30Taylor R. McHale B. Nargang F.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 765-775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 33Humphries A.D. Streimann I.C. Stojanovski D. Johnston A.J. Yano M. Hoogenraad N.J.

In this study we describe the effects of changing several regions containing conserved residues of Tom40 on the assembly, stability, and function of the TOM complex.

These were linearized and used to transform conidia from the RIP40het strain by electroporation (30Taylor R. McHale B. Nargang F.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 765-775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). RIP40het is a heterokaryon containing two distinct nuclei. The first carries a wild type copy of tom40, an inositol requirement, and a leucine requirement. The second contains a null allele of tom40 created by repeat-induced point mutation (RIP), leucine and lysine requirements, and cycloheximide resistance. Mutant tom40 alleles that maintain sufficient Tom40 function should rescue the nucleus containing the nonfunctional tom40RIP allele. Selection and purification of transformants was as described (30Taylor R. McHale B. Nargang F.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 765-775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Nutritional testing for the lysine and leucine requirements of the original tom40RIP-containing nucleus was performed to confirm the rescue of the RIPed nucleus with the mutant tom40 gene. Conformation that the desired mutant allele was present in the rescued homokaryon was obtained by sequencing the PCR-amplified ectopic tom40 gene from isolated genomic DNA. Mutant alleles of tom40 cDNAs for in vitro transcription/translation were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis as described (30Taylor R. McHale B. Nargang F.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 765-775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Blue Native Gel Electrophoresis (BNGE)—Mitochondria (50 μg) were solubilized in 50 μl of buffer containing detergent (either 1% digitonin (DIG) or 1% n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside (DDM) in 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 0.1 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaCl, 1% glycerol (v/v), 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). After gentle rocking at 4 °C for 15 min and a clarifying spin (30 min, 4 °C, 13,000 rpm), the supernatant was added to 5 μl of sample buffer (5% Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250 in 100 mm BisTris, 500 mm 6-aminocaproic acid, pH 7.0) and gently mixed at 4 °C. Samples were analyzed on a 6–13% gradient blue native gel as described previously (50Schägger H. Cramer W.A. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 217: 220-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (1043) Google Scholar, 51Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 199: 223-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (1918) Google Scholar) except that electrophoresis was performed overnight (about 16 to 20 h) at 4 °C between 40 and 60 V before the excess Coomassie Blue was electrophoresed out of the gel for 1 to 1½ 500 V. In Vitro Import of Radiolabeled Proteins into Isolated Mitochondria—For in vitro import studies, mitochondria were isolated as described (52Mayer A. Lill R. Neupert W. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 1233-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), and import of mitochondrial preproteins was basically as described (53Harkness T.A.A. Nargang F.E. Van der Klei I. Neupert W. Lill R. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 637-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The preproteins of porin and Tom40 were imported at 15 °C, and all other preproteins were imported at 25 °C. Preproteins were produced by coupled transcription and translation in rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Promega TnT reticulocyte lysate system, Madison WI) in the presence of [35S]methionine (ICN Biomedicals, Costa Mesa CA). Incubation time points were as indicated in figure legends. Import reactions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and viewed by autoradiography or a PhosphorImager system. Quantification of the image from the latter was done using the ImageQuant program (version 5.2; Amersham Biosciences). In some cases, Tom40 import reactions were examined by BNGE and autoradiography. For these experiments, in vitro import of Tom40 proteins labeled with [35S]methionine was as described (48Rapaport D. Taylor R. Käser M. Langer T. Neupert W. Nargang F.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1189-1198Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Time Course Pulse Import of Tom40 Variant Preproteins—For pulse imports with mutant Tom40 preproteins, an import mixture consisting of 50 μg of isolated mitochondria in 50 μl of mitochondrial suspension buffer (250 mm sucrose, 10 mm MOPS-KOH, pH 7.2), 2 μl of a lysate containing the desired variant of Tom40 labeled with [35S]methionine, and 100 μl of import buffer (0.5% bovine serum albumin (w/v), 250 mm sucrose, 80 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm ATP, 10 mm MOPS-KOH, pH 7.2) was assembled. The amount of each component of the import mixture was multiplied by the number of time points to be analyzed. The reaction was incubated at 25 °C for 2 min. Mitochondria were re-isolated by centrifugation at 2 °C for 15 min at 15,000 rpm. The mitochondria were then resuspended in 100 μl of fresh import buffer, without Tom40 lysate, and incubated at 25 °C. Aliquots were taken at each time point and added to 500 μl of ice-cold mitochondrial suspension buffer. Samples were centrifuged at 2 °C for 15 min at 15,000 rpm, and the pellets were kept on ice until all time points could be processed for BNGE. Other Techniques—Agarose gel electrophoresis, transformation of E. coli, isolation of bacterial plasmid DNA, cloning, restriction digests of plasmid DNA, and PCR were carried out using standard protocols (54Ausubel R.A.

The following techniques were performed as described previously: separation of mitochondrial proteins by PAGE (56Lämmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar), Western blotting (57Good A.G.

Genetics. 2005; 169: 123-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The following procedures were performed as recommended by the supplier: Western blot detection using LumiGLO chemiluminescent substrate (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories), protein determination by the Coomassie dye binding assay (Bio-Rad), automated sequencing using a BigDye Terminator Cycle sequencing kit (version 3.1) with a model 373 stretch sequencer separation system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), and bacterial DNA plasmid isolation with Qiagen mini-prep spin kits (Qiagen Inc., Santa Clarita, CA). Nonrelevant regions/lanes of autoradiographs were digitally removed. Creation of Tom40 Mutant Strains—The specific regions in the Tom40 protein that are important for its targeting to mitochondria, assembly into the TOM complex, interactions with other subunits, and its activity as a pore are not well defined. We reasoned that the residues responsible for some or all of these activities might be localized by functional analysis of specific mutations affecting the protein. Alignments of Tom40 proteins from various species show several regions with a high degree of conservation that may be important to the structure and function of the protein (30Taylor R. McHale B. Nargang F.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 765-775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 47Gabriel K. Egan B. Lithgow T. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2386-2390Crossref Scopus (76) Google Scholar). We chose 10 of these regions for site-directed mutagenesis of a cloned genomic version of tom40. Mutations (shown in Fig. 1 and listed in Table 2) were made in pairs with the targeted residues either deleted or changed to Ala residues. The deletion mutations were named “Δ” followed by the number of the first residue of the region that was deleted. The Ala substitutions were named “A” followed by the number of the first residue of the region that was changed to an Ala residue. We also made one additional mutation by deleting the Pro residue at position 185 (Δ185) to give a total of 21 tom40 mutant alleles (Table 2). Plasmids encoding these variants were transformed into the sheltered heterokaryon RIP40het (Table 1). The lysine-leucine-requiring nucleus of this heterokaryon carries a null allele of tom40 (30Taylor R. McHale B. Nargang F.E. J. Biol.

In this work, we present mechanistic, spectroscopic, and structural evidence for peroxide- and ligand-induced conformational mobility of the distal histidine residue (His-42) in a site-directed variant of ascorbate peroxidase (W41A). In this variant, His-42 binds “on” to the heme in the oxidized form, duplicating the active site structure of the cytochromes b but, in contrast to the cytochromes b, is able to swing “off” the iron during catalysis. This conformational flexibility between the on and off forms is fully reversible and is used as a means to overcome the inherently unreactive nature of the on form toward peroxide, so that essentially complete catalytic activity is maintained. Contrary to the widely adopted view of heme enzyme catalysis, these data indicate that strong coordination of the distal histidine to the heme iron does not automatically undermine catalytic activity. The data add a new dimension to our wider appreciation of structure/activity correlations in other heme enzymes.

The data add a new dimension to our wider appreciation of structure/activity correlations in other heme enzymes. The heme peroxidase enzymes catalyze H2O2-dependent oxidation of a range of substrates through a mechanism that, in all cases, involves formation of an oxidized ferryl intermediate (known as Compound I; see Equation 1) that is subsequently reduced by substrate (Equations 2 and 3) (1Everse J. Everse K.E. Grishham M.B. Peroxidases in Chemistry and Biology. Vol. 1 and 2. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1991Google Scholar, 2Dunford H.B. Heme Peroxidases. John Wiley, Chichester, United Kingdom1999Google Scholar). In the majority of cases, reduction of Compound I occurs by two successive single-electron transfer steps, as follows (where P = peroxidase, HS = substrate, S· = 1-electron oxidized form of substrate). P+H2O2k1→Compound I+H2O(Eq. 1) Compound I+HSk2→Compound II+S⋅ (Eq. 2) Compound II+HSk3→P+S⋅+H2O(Eq. 3) Structural information is available for a number of heme peroxidase enzymes, and in all cases the heme iron is poised in a 5- or 6-coordinate environment with the sixth ligand provided by a weakly coordinated water molecule. This differs from the heme coordination geometry in other noncatalytic heme proteins that do not require binding of an exogenous ligand at the metal site. The classic example is the cytochromes, which typically have a strong endogenous protein ligand at the sixth site (usually His or Met) and no vacant coordination site for iron-catalyzed chemistry to occur. The prevailing view that has emerged, therefore, is that the catalytic enzymes (which include the heme peroxidases but also embraces other, more complex heme enzymes such as heme oxygenase, the cytochrome P450s, and cytochrome c oxidase) usually contain 5-coordinate or weakly 6-coordinate heme groups that allow facile reaction with substrate, whereas the electron transfer proteins, for example the cytochromes, have no vacant site at the metal ion for catalysis to occur. In line with the above considerations, there are no known examples of a genuine heme peroxidase with bis-histidine ligation, but there are a few examples in the literature of different heme peroxidases, or site-directed variants thereof, in which coordination of the distal histidine residue has been proposed on the basis of spectroscopic studies (3Cheek J.

Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 11524-11535Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) variants of cytochrome c peroxidase; thermally inactivated manganese peroxidase (4Sutherland G.R.J. Zapanta S. Tien M. Aust S.D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3654-3662Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar); and manganese peroxidase at alkaline pH (8Youngs H.L. Moenne-Loccoz P. Loehr T.M. Gold M.H. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9994-10000Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Removal of the ligands coordinating to the bound K+-site in ascorbate peroxidase also leads to formation of a low-spin species (3Cheek J. Mandelman D. Poulos T.L. Dawson J.H. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 1999; 4: 64-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In none of these cases has unambiguous structural information been obtained, however. In this work, we present the first crystallographically defined example of a functional peroxidase enzyme with bis-histidine ligation in the W41A variant of ascorbate peroxidase. This variant duplicates the heme coordination geometry of the cytochromes b in the oxidized form but remains fully competent for formation of the catalytic Compound I and Compound II intermediates, as well as for substrate oxidation, by means of a reaction mechanism in which a conformationally mobile ligand (His-42) binds “on” and then swings “off” the iron during catalysis. This switch between the on and off forms is triggered by reaction with hydrogen peroxide (or other ligands) and, under catalytic conditions, is fully reversible, allowing essentially complete activity to be maintained. These data indicate that strong coordination of the distal histidine residue to the heme iron does not automatically undermine peroxidase activity. Materials—l-Ascorbic acid (Aldrich), guaiacol (Sigma), and the chemicals used for buffers (Fisher) were of the highest analytical grade (more than 99% pure) and were used without further purification. Hydrogen peroxide solutions were freshly prepared by dilution of a 30% (v/v) solution (BDH Chemicals); exact concentrations were determined using the published absorption coefficient (ϵ240 = 39.4 m1- cm-1 (9Nelson D.P. Kiesow L.A. Anal. Biochem. 1972; 49: 474-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar)). Aqueous solutions were prepared using water purified through an Elgastat Option 2 water purifier, which itself was fed with deionized water. All pH measurements were made using a Russell pH-electrode attached to a digital pH-meter (Radiometer Copenhagen, model PHM 93). Mutagenesis and Protein Purification—Site-directed mutagenesis on recombinant soybean cytosolic APX (rsAPX) 2The abbreviations used are: APX, ascorbate peroxidase; rsAPX, recombinant soybean cytosolic ascorbate peroxidase; sh, shoulder; MALDI, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization; TOF, time-of-flight. was performed according to the QuikChange™ protocol (Stratagene Ltd., Cambridge, UK). Two oligonucleotides encoding the desired mutation were synthesized and purified (Invitrogen). For W41A, the primers were: 5′-GCTCCGTTTGGCAGCGCACTCTGCTGGAACC-3′ (forward primer) and 3′-GGTTCCAGCAGAGTGCGCTGCCAAACGGAGC-5′ (reverse primer). DNA sequencing of the entire coding region using an Applied Biosystems 3730 DNA analyzer was used to confirm the desired mutation and the absence of spurious mutations. Bacterial fermentation of cells and purification of rsAPX and W41A was carried out according to published procedures (10Metcalfe C.L. Ott M. Patel N. Singh K. Mistry S.C. Goff H.M. Raven E.L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004; 126: 16242-16248Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 11Lad L. Mewies M. Raven E.L. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 13774-13781Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Enzyme purity was assessed by examination of the Asoret/A280 value; in all cases an Asoret/A280 value of >1.7 for rsAPX and W41A was considered pure. Enzyme purity was also assessed using SDS-PAGE, and the preparations were judged to be homogeneous by the observation of a single band on a Coomassie Blue-stained reducing SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Enzyme concentrations for the W41A mutant were determined using the pyridine hemochromagen method (12Antonini M. Brunori E. Hemoglobin and Myoglobin and Their Reactions with Ligands. North Holland Publishers, Amsterdam1971Google Scholar); an absorption coefficient of ϵ405 = 125 mm-1 cm-1 was determined for W41A. Enzyme concentrations of rsAPX were determined using the ϵ407 = 107 mm-1 cm-1 (13Jones D.K. Dalton D.A. Rosell F.I. Lloyd Raven E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 360: 173-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Mass Spectrometry—The integrity of the tryptophan mutant was confirmed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. A 10 pmol/μl stock of the W41A mutant was made up in water and 0.5 μl of the 1:1 protein/matrix mixture (sinapinic acid (5 mg/ml) in 1:1 acetonitrile/water, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) was spotted onto a MALDI target plate using the drying droplet method. The MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems) was calibrated in the range of 5000 to 35,000 Da with a protein mass standard kit (Sequazyme, Applied Biosystems). Spectra were accumulated in the same mass range using an average of at least 250 laser shots. The spectra were analyzed using Data Explorer software (Applied Biosystems). The MALDI-TOF mass spectrum of W41A gives a mass of 28,209.36 ± 0.05% Da (calculated mass for W41A = 28,203.74 Da), indicating that no posttranslational modification has occurred. Steady-state Kinetics—Steady-state measurements (sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, μ = 0.1 m, [enzyme] = 25 nm, 25 °C) were carried out according to published protocols (14Mittler R. Zilinskas B.A. Plant Physiol. 1991; 97: 962-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Oxidation of ascorbate was monitored at 290 nm (ϵ290 = 2.8 mm-1 cm-1) (15Asada K. Methods Enzymol. 1984; 105: 422-427Crossref Scopus (285) Google Scholar) and initial rates were multiplied by a factor of 2 to account for the fast disproportionation (k ≈ 106m-1 s-1) of the mono-dehydroascorbate radical to ascorbate and dehydroascorbate (16Kelly G.J. Latzko E. Naturewissenschaften. 1979; 66: 617-618PubMed Google Scholar). For oxidation of guaiacol, stock solutions (100 mm) were prepared in sodium phosphate buffer containing 30% ethanol (17Santimone M. Can. J. Biochem. 1975; 53: 649-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), and oxidation to tetraguaiacol was monitored at 470 nm (ϵ470 = 22.6 mm-1 cm-1 (17Santimone M. Can. J. Biochem. 1975; 53: 649-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar)). Values for kcat were calculated by dividing the maximum rate of activity (μm-1 s-1) by the micromolar concentration of the enzyme. Values for Km were determined by a fit of the data to the Michaelis-Menten equation using a nonlinear regression analysis program (Kalieda-Graph, version 3.09, Synergy Software). All reported values are the mean of three independent assays. Transient-state Kinetics—Transient-state measurements were performed using an SX.18MV microvolume stopped-flow spectrophotometer (Applied Photophysics) fitted with a Neslab RTE-200 circulating water bath (±0.1 °C). Reported values of kobs are an average of at least five measurements. Individual traces were monophasic in all cases. All kinetic data were analyzed using nonlinear least squares regression analysis on an Archimedes 410-1 microcomputer (Applied Photophysics) using Spectrakinetics software. All curve fitting was performed using the Grafit 5 software package (Grafit version 5.0.3, Erithacus Software Ltd.). Pseudo-first-order rate constants for the formation of Compound I (k1,obs) were monitored by a decrease in absorbance (corresponding to the formation of Compound I) at 407 nm for rsAPX and 405 nm for W41A in single mixing mode by mixing enzyme (1 μm) with various concentrations of H2O2. Multiple wavelength absorption studies were carried out using a photodiode array detector and X-SCAN software (Applied Photophysics). Spectral deconvolution was performed by global analysis and numerical integration methods using PROKIN software (Applied Photophysics). EPR Spectroscopy—EPR spectra ([W41A] = 300 μm) were recorded in sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0, μ = 0.10 m) and glycerol (50% v/v). X-Band EPR spectra were recorded on a Bruker ER-300D series electromagnet and microwave source interfaced to a Bruker EMX control unit and fitted with an ESR-9 liquid helium flow cryostat from Oxford Instruments and a dual mode microwave cavity from Bruker (ER-4116DM). Crystal Growth and Structure Determination—Crystals of rsAPX and the W41A mutant were obtained using the previously published procedures (18Sharp K.H. Mewies M. Moody P.C.E. Raven E.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 303-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Crystals of the cyanide-bound forms of rsAPX and the W41A mutant were obtained by dissolving a few crystals of potassium cyanide in 10 ml of mother liquor (0.1 m Hepes, pH 8.3, and 2.25 m lithium sulfate). Crystals of the NO-bound heme complexes were obtained by soaking crystals in sodium dithionite in the mother liquor followed by the addition of crystals of potassium nitrite, which reacts with excess dithionite to produce nitric oxide (19Leys D. Backers K. Meyer T.E. Hagen W.R. Cusanovich M.A. Van Beeumen J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16050-16056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). For H2O2 soaks of W41A, crystals were soaked in 0.1 m H2O2, left for 5 min, and then frozen in liquid nitrogen. The heme coordination geometry in cytochrome c peroxidase is known to be sensitive to the presence of noncoordinating anions (e.g. phosphate, nitrate; see for example, Refs. 6Vitello L.B. Erman J.E.

Glycerol also was not used in the crystallization studies. Diffraction data for W41A and the NO- and cyanide-bound forms were collected at beamline ID23-EH1 using an ADSC Quantum-315 detector, whereas data for the W41A-H2O2 soak was collected at beamline ID14-EH4 using an ADSC Quantum-4 detector all at the ESRF, Grenoble. Data for the rsAPX-NO and rsAPX-CN complexes were collected at DESY (Hamburg) at beamline X-11 using a MAR 165 mm CCD detector. All synchrotron data were collected at 100 K. Data collected at the ESRF was indexed and scaled using MOSFLM (24Leslie A.G.W. Joint CCP4 + ESF-EAMCB Newsletter on Protein Crystallography, No. 26. 1992; Google Scholar) and SCALA (25Collaborative Computational ProjectActa Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19762) Google Scholar), and data collected at DESY was indexed and scaled using the HKL programs DENZO and SCALEPACK (26Otwinoski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 227: 366-396Google Scholar). Data collection and processing statistics are shown in Table 1; 5% of the data were flagged for the calculation of Rfree and excluded from subsequent refinement. The structures were refined from a model derived from the 1.45-Å rsAPX-ascorbate complex (Protein Data Bank accession code 1OAF) by the removal of bound ligand and water molecules. Several cycles of refinement using REFMAC5 (27Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13865) Google Scholar) from the CCP4 suite (25Collaborative Computational ProjectActa Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23349) Google Scholar) followed by the addition of water molecules were carried out until the Rfree and Rfactor values converged. In total, six crystal structures and diffraction data have been deposited with the following identifiers: Protein Data Bank codes 2GGN (ferric W41A), 2GHC (W41A-NO complex), 2GHD (W41A-CN complex), 2GHE (W41A-H2O2 soak), 2GHH (rsAPX-NO complex), and 2GHK (rsAPX-CN complex).

The spectrum (λmax/nm (ϵ/mm-1 cm-1 = 405 (125), 525, 564, 630) differs from that of the wild type enzyme (λmax/nm (ϵ/mm-1 = 407 (107), 525, ≈630 (11Lad L. Mewies M. Raven E.L. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 13774-13781Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar); Fig. 1) and shows a peak in the visible region (564) that is consistent with the presence of low-spin heme. (The corresponding W41A variant in pea cytosolic APX was also examined (data not shown); in this variant similar wavelength maxima are observed but the Soret band is shifted to 412 nm.) The high-spin peak at ≈630 nm in the wild type enzyme is still visible in the variant (Fig. 1). No evidence for the formation of (low-spin) hydroxide-bound heme was observed at alkaline pH (data not shown); hence, the low-spin species was tentatively assigned as arising from coordination of an (internal) protein ligand. Reaction of ferric W41A with various noncatalytic ligands is informative because it allows us to assess whether the proposed protein ligand is reversibly or irreversibly bound to the metal. Addition of potassium cyanide to the ferric derivative of W41A leads to a spectrum in which complete formation of low-spin heme is now observed (λmax/nm = 418, 540, 561sh; Fig. 1). This suggests that addition of a strong exogenous ligand leads to displacement of the existing (internal) ligand. As shown below, the crystal structure of the cyanide-bound derivative of W41A confirms this observation. Additionally, we have observed that NO binds to the reduced heme (λmax = 417, 541, 574 nm); the crystal structure of the NO-bound derivative also confirms that His-42 is displaced (see below). EPR spectroscopy provides further evidence in support of a low-spin heme species (Fig. 2). The EPR spectrum of ferric W41A is dominated by a rhombic low-spin species with observed g-values of 3.22 and 2.05 (the third feature is too broad to be observed). A second, minor component with g-values of 5.67 and 1.99 is consistent with an axial, high-spin species. The low-spin species is the majority species at 10 K and is consistent with bis-histidine ligation; the g-values are consistent with an orientation in which the imidazole planes are not parallel to each other. Neither species resembles those observed in the EPR spectrum of the wild type enzyme, which has a rhombic high-spin species (g = 6.04, 5.27, and 1.98) and a small amount of rhombic low-spin heme (g = 2.69, 2.21, and 1.79) (13Jones D.K. Dalton D.A. Rosell F.I. Lloyd Raven E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 360: 173-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 29Gadsby P.M. Thomson A.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1990; 112: 5003-5011Crossref Scopus (144) Google Scholar). A minor low-spin rhombic species (gz = 2.95, as a shoulder on the g = 3.22 feature) and the positive lobe of gy feature (gy = 2.30) in W41A are likely to arise from a histidine/histidine-ligated heme in which the imidazole planes are parallel to each other (note that there is also evidence for multiple conformations of the proximal histidine in the crystal structure of the cyanidebound form of W41A; see above). X-ray Crystallography of W41A and Its Cyanide- and NO-bound Derivatives—The crystal structure of the cyanide-bound derivative of W41A (Fig. 3 and Table 1) confirms the observations made in solution. In this structure (Fig. 3B), which closely maps onto that for the cyanide-bound form of rsAPX (Fig. 3A), the iron is ligated by the cyanide ligand and the nitrogen of the bound ligand is hydrogen-bonded (2.8 Å) to Nϵ of His-42 (2.5 Å in rsAPX). For the W41A-CN complex, the electron density observed for the proximal His-163 residue is consistent with two orientations of this side chain (Fig. 3B). One orientation has His-163 hydrogen-bonded to Asp-208 (3.3 Å) as for rsAPX (3.1 Å); the other orientation has His-163 hydrogen-bonded (2.8 Å) to the backbone carbonyl of Ser-160 (3.8 Å in rsAPX). In the rsAPX-CN structure a single conformation of His-163 is observed; however, the data are to lower resolution (2.0 Å compared with 1.4 Å), and a second orientation of the proximal histidine may not be observed because of the large effect of the heme electron density. The crystal structure of the NO-bound derivative of W41A also confirm that His-42 is displaced (Fig. 3D). In this case, and in contrast to rsAPX-NO (Fig. 3C), removal of the hydrogen bond to Trp-41 means that the NO ligand now adopts two conformations. To clarify the nature of the low-spin heme in ferric W41A, diffraction data to 1.75 Å were obtained (Fig. 4 and Table 1). W41A is very similar in its overall structure to the wild type protein; the root-mean-square deviation between Cα positions (residues 2-249) for this structure and ferric rsAPX is 0.260 Å (determined using LSQKAB (30Kabsch W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1976; 32: 922-923Crossref Scopus (2351) Google Scholar)). The structure of W41A shows that space previously occupied by the Trp side chain is now filled by two water molecules (labeled 1 and 2 in Fig. 4A). Although the overall structure and most of the active site structure is similar to rsAPX, there are local changes in protein conformation around His-42 (Fig. 4B). Hence, the main chain of His-42 moves toward the heme in W41A such that Nϵ of His-42 is now within bonding distance (2.3 Å, compared with 5.5 Å in rsAPX) of the iron. We refer to this as the “on” form. A further water molecule (labeled 3 in Fig. 4A) is located in the region that was previously occupied by His-42. The Fe-Nϵ(His-163) distance is essentially identical in both W41A and rsAPX (2.1 and 2.0 Å, respectively). This new histidine ligand replaces a water molecule that is bonded to the iron in the wild type protein (2.1 Å). This movement of the main chain of His-42 toward the heme in the on form and the subsequent alteration in heme geometry are the consequences of the removal of the bulky Trp-41 residue, which allows the His-42 side chain to ligate to the iron. Examination of the electron density for W41A around His-42 indicates that there is positive Fo - Fc density above His-42 and also close to the main chain of His-42 (carbonyl oxygen; Fig. 4). This density overlays with the orientation of His-42 in rsAPX and is consistent with the presence of a minority (presumed high-spin) heme species in which His-42 is not ligated. There are two explanations of this observation. First, the spectroscopic data presented above are also consistent with some high-spin heme in the ferric form; in this case, the residual electron density would arise from a mixed population of high- and low-spin iron in the crystal. Second, although we used ferric enzyme in our experiments, we recognize that partial reduction of heme is possible during data collection (31Berglund G.I. Carlsson G.H. Smith A.T. Szoke H. Henriksen A. Hajdu J. Nature. 2002; 417: 463-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar). The electronic spectrum of ferrous W41A shows maxima (λmax/nm = 428, 556, 581) that are similar to those for rsAPX (λmax/nm = 431, 555, 585) and are not consistent with bis-histidine ligation, indicating that dissociation of His-42 probably occurs on reduction. In this case, the residual electron density would arise from partial reduction of the heme during data collection. We were not able to obtain crystallographic data for the ferrous W41A derivative. Whatever the origin of the residual density, the important feature is that the data clearly indicate that His-42 is flexible and can adopt more than one conformation. Reactivity toward H2O2—The data presented above indicated that, although the heme is largely 6-coordinate and low-spin in ferric W41A (with two strong histidine ligands), His-42 is not irreversibly bound to the heme and may dissociate under certain conditions. We refer to this dissociated form as the “off” form. If this is the case, then reaction with H2O2 and turnover of substrate may still be possible. Because there is, to our knowledge, no unambiguous example of a crystallographically defined bis-histidine-ligated peroxidase in the literature, it was of critical interest to establish whether strong axial ligation, analogous to that observed for example in the cytochromes b, would preclude reaction with H2O2. Rate constants for Compound I formation in W41A were determined under pseudo-first-order conditions ([H2O2] = 10-125 × [W41A]). The W41A variant was shown to be competent for formation of Compound I under these conditions, albeit at a lower rate, as evidenced by a decrease in absorbance at 405 nm. These changes in absorbance duplicate those observed for rsAPX (11Lad L. Mewies M. Raven E.L. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 13774-13781Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Observed rate constants for this process, k1,obs, showed a clearly nonlinear dependence on the concentration of hydrogen peroxide (Fig. 5A). This is in contrast to the data for rsAPX, in which a linear dependence on [H2O2] is observed in the experimentally accessible concentration range (k1 = (3.3 ± 0.1) × 107m-1 s-1 (11Lad L. Mewies M. Raven E.L. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 13774-13781Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar)). The nonlinear dependence is consistent with a mechanism that requires a conformational change of the protein, proposed to be conversion between the on and off forms, prior to reaction with H2O2, as shown in Equations 4 and 5 (CI = Compound I). W41Aonk1⇌k−1W41Aoff(Eq. 4) W41Aoff+H2O2k2→Cl+H2O(Eq. 5) In the presence of excess H2O2, the observed rate constant, k1,obs, can be expressed as follows (Equation 6). k1,obs=k1k2[H2O2]k−1+k2[H2O2](Eq. 6) A fit of these data for W41A to Equation 6 (Fig. 5A) yields values for the limiting first-order rate constant, k1, of 2370 s-1 and the composite second order rate constant, k1k2/k-1, of 6.6 × 106m-1 s-1. In separate experiments, the reaction of W41A with H2O2 was studied using photodiode array detection (Fig. 5B). Data collected over a period of 500 ms were best-fitted to a two-step model (A → B → C, as shown previously for rsAPX (11Lad L. Mewies M. Raven E.L. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 13774-13781Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar)), where A is ferric W41A, B is Compound I, and C is Compound II. Spectra for the Compound I (λmax/nm = 410, 530, 569"
https://openalex.org/W2094241191,"Herpesvirus saimiri (HVS) is a lymphotropic virus that causes T-cell lymphomas in New World primates. It encodes a structural homolog of complement control proteins named complement control protein homolog (CCPH). Previously, CCPH has been shown to inhibit C3d deposition on target cells exposed to complement. Here we have studied the mechanism by which it inactivates complement. We have expressed the soluble form of CCPH in Escherichia coli, purified to homogeneity and compared its activity to vaccinia virus complement control protein (VCP) and human complement regulators factor H and soluble complement receptor 1. The expressed soluble form of CCPH bound to C3b (KD = 19.2 μm) as well as to C4b (KD = 0.8 μm) and accelerated the decay of the classical/lectin as well as alternative pathway C3-convertases. In addition, it also served as factor I cofactor and supported factor I-mediated inactivation of both C3b and C4b. Time course analysis indicated that although its rate of inactivation of C4b is comparable with VCP, it is 14-fold more potent than VCP in inactivating C3b. Site-directed mutagenesis revealed that Arg-118, which corresponds to Lys-120 of variola virus complement regulator SPICE (a residue critical for its enhanced C3b cofactor activity), contributes significantly in enhancing this activity. Thus, our data indicate that HVS encodes a potent complement inhibitor that allows HVS to evade the host complement attack. Herpesvirus saimiri (HVS) is a lymphotropic virus that causes T-cell lymphomas in New World primates. It encodes a structural homolog of complement control proteins named complement control protein homolog (CCPH). Previously, CCPH has been shown to inhibit C3d deposition on target cells exposed to complement. Here we have studied the mechanism by which it inactivates complement. We have expressed the soluble form of CCPH in Escherichia coli, purified to homogeneity and compared its activity to vaccinia virus complement control protein (VCP) and human complement regulators factor H and soluble complement receptor 1. The expressed soluble form of CCPH bound to C3b (KD = 19.2 μm) as well as to C4b (KD = 0.8 μm) and accelerated the decay of the classical/lectin as well as alternative pathway C3-convertases. In addition, it also served as factor I cofactor and supported factor I-mediated inactivation of both C3b and C4b.

Site-directed mutagenesis revealed that Arg-118, which corresponds to Lys-120 of variola virus complement regulator SPICE (a residue critical for its enhanced C3b cofactor activity), contributes significantly in enhancing this activity. Thus, our data indicate that HVS encodes a potent complement inhibitor that allows HVS to evade the host complement attack. The complement system is an integral participant in the innate mechanisms of immunity and, thus, has a burden of performing surveillance in the host and protecting it from all the pathogens including viruses (1Cooper N.R.

Earlier studies have decisively demonstrated that both acute and latent viruses are susceptible to complement-mediated neutralization (3Bernet J. Mullick J. Singh A.K. Sahu A. J.

Thus, complement exerts a strong selective pressure on viruses during infection. These data suggest that for their successful survival, viruses must have developed mechanisms to subvert this system. Consistent with this premise, genome sequencing of poxviruses and herpesviruses have shown that members of these families encode for structural homologs of human regulators of the complement activation (RCA) 3The abbreviations used are: RCA, regulators of complement activation; AP, alternative pathway; CP, classical pathway; HVS, herpesvirus saimiri; CCP, complement control protein; vCCP, viral CCP; CCPH, complement control protein homolog; sCCPH, soluble CCPH of herpesvirus saimiri; VCP, vaccinia virus complement control protein; SPICE, smallpox inhibitor of complement enzymes; MOPICE, monkeypox inhibitor of complement enzymes; Kaposica, Kaposis's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus inhibitor of complement activation; sCR1, soluble complement receptor 1; EA, antibody coated sheep erythrocytes; ORF, open reading frame; RU, response unit.3The abbreviations used are: RCA, regulators of complement activation; AP, alternative pathway; CP, classical pathway; HVS, herpesvirus saimiri; CCP, complement control protein; vCCP, viral CCP; CCPH, complement control protein homolog; sCCPH, soluble CCPH of herpesvirus saimiri; VCP, vaccinia virus complement control protein; SPICE, smallpox inhibitor of complement enzymes; MOPICE, monkeypox inhibitor of complement enzymes; Kaposica, Kaposis's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus inhibitor of complement activation; sCR1, soluble complement receptor 1; EA, antibody coated sheep erythrocytes; ORF, open reading frame; RU, response unit. family (5Seet B.T.

The RCA family members are formed by tandemly repeating complement control protein (CCP) domains or short consensus repeats, which fold into a bead-like structure, and multiple CCPs are separated by linkers of 2-7 residues (10Hourcade D.

These proteins regulate complement by two distinct mechanisms (i) by accelerating the irreversible dissociation of the classical/lectin (C4b,2a) and alternative (C3b,Bb) pathway C3-convertases and (ii) by serving as cofactors in serine protease factor I-mediated inactivation of C3b and C4b (the subunits of C3-convertases) (13Pangburn M.K.

Sequence comparison of the viral homologs of RCA (vCCPs) show that the sequence similarity between the poxvirus homologs exceeds 91%, whereas that among the herpesvirus homologs varies from 43 to 89%. These data suggest that the herpesvirus homologs are more diverse in structure compared with the poxvirus homologs. Whether this structural diversity in herpesvirus homologs is also reflected in their function is not clear, as among the herpesvirus homologs, detailed functional characterization has been performed only for the Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus homolog (Kaposica/KCP) (19Mullick J.

Herpesvirus saimiri (HVS), the prototype of rhadinoviruses, is regularly found in its natural host, the squirrel monkey. Although it does not cause any disease in its natural host, infection in other New World primates such as tamarins, common marmosets, and owl monkey causes acute peripheral T cell lymphoma within less than 2 months (23Desrosiers R.C. Falk L.A. J. Virol. 1982; 43: 352-356Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Desrosiers R.C. Bakker A. Kamine J. Falk L.A. Hunt R.D. King N.W. Science. 1985; 228: 184-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In addition, the virus is also capable of transforming simian and human T cells in vitro (25Biesinger B. Trimble J.J. Desrosiers R.C. Fleckenstein B. Virology. 1990; 176: 505-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 26Cabanillas J.A. Cambronero R. Pacheco-Castro A. Garcia-Rodriguez M.C. Martin-Fernandez J.M. Fontan G. Regueiro J.R. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 2002; 127: 366-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Interestingly, unlike any other viruses, the HVS harbors two homologs of complement regulatory proteins, (i) a homolog of RCA encoded by ORF4 and (ii) a homolog of the terminal complement inhibitor CD59 encoded by ORF15 (27Albrecht J.C. Nicholas J. Biller D. Cameron K.R. Biesinger B. Newman C. Wittmann S. Craxton M.A. Coleman H. Fleckenstein B. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 5047-5058Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Means R.E. Choi J.K. Nakamura H. Chung Y.H. Ishido S. Jung J.U. Curr. Top Microbiol. Immunol. 2002; 269: 187-201PubMed Google Scholar). The ORF4 was predicted to encode a protein containing four CCP modules followed by a transmembrane domain. Analysis of posttranscriptional processing indicated that ORF4 transcript occurs as unspliced as well as single-spliced mRNA. The unspliced mRNA codes for a membrane-bound glycoprotein containing four extracellular CCPs along with a transmembrane region, whereas the spliced mRNA codes for a soluble protein that lacks transmembrane region (29Albrecht J.C. Fleckenstein B. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 3937-3940Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Initial characterization of the RCA homolog of HVS (named complement control protein homolog, CCPH) showed that expression of the membrane form of this protein on BALB/3T3 cells inhibited C3d deposition on these cells when they were incubated with whole human serum (30Fodor W.L. Rollins S.A. Biancocaron S. Rother R.P. Guilmette E.R. Burton W.V. Albrecht J.C. Fleckenstein B. Squinto S.P. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 3889-3892Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although this study demonstrated the complement inhibiting activity of this protein, the mechanism by which it inactivates complement activation was not elucidated. In the present study we describe the mechanism of complement regulation by the RCA homolog of HVS. Our results show that the soluble form of the RCA homolog (sCCPH; CCP1-4 without the transmembrane domain) interacts with complement proteins C3b as well as C4b and accelerates decay of the classical/lectin and alternative pathway C3-convertases. In addition, the protein also has the ability to serve as factor I cofactor and support factor I-mediated inactivation of C3b and C4b. Importantly, we show that its factor I cofactor activity for C3b is 14-fold higher in comparison to VCP, the most completely characterized vCCP, and that Arg-118 plays a critical role in enhancing this activity. Reagents and Buffers—Antibody-coated sheep erythrocytes (EA) were made by incubating sheep erythrocytes with anti-sheep erythrocyte antibodies procured from ICN Biomedical Inc. (Irvine, CA). Veronal-buffered saline (VBS) contained 5 mm barbital, 145 mm NaCl, and 0.02% sodium azide, pH 7.4. GVB was VBS containing 0.1% gelatin, GVB2+ was GVB containing 0.5 mm MgCl2 and 0.15 mm CaCl2, and GVBE was GVB with 10 mm EDTA. MgEGTA contained 0.1 m MgCl2 and 0.1 m EGTA, and phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, contained 10 mm sodium phosphate and 145 mm NaCl. Complement Proteins and Their Proteolytically Activated Products—The human complement protein C3 was purified according to Hammer et al. (31Hammer C.H. Wirtz G.H. Renfer L. Gresham H.D. Tack B.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 3995-4006Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with minor modifications as previously described (17Mullick J. Bernet J. Panse Y. Hallihosur S. Singh A.K. Sahu A. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 12382-12393Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), and native C3 was separated from C3 (H2O) by running on a Mono S column (32Pangburn M.K. J. Immunol. Methods. 1987; 102: 7-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The complement factors H and I were kindly provided by Prof. Michael K. Pangburn (University of Texas Health Centre, Tyler, TX.). Human factor B was purified as follows. Human plasma was subjected to a stepwise precipitation with 11 and 26% polyethylene glycol. The 26% polyethylene glycol precipitate was dissolved in 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, run on Source Q column (Amersham Biosciences) in the same buffer, and eluted with a linear gradient of 0-0.5 m NaCl. Fractions containing factor B were identified by Ouchterlony analysis, pooled, and loaded onto a Mono S 5/5 column (Amersham Biosciences) in 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.0. Bound proteins were eluted with a linear salt gradient of 0-0.5 m NaCl and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Homogeneous factor B fractions were pooled and concentrated. The recombinant human soluble form of complement receptor type 1 (sCR1) was a generous gift from Dr. Henry Marsh (AVANT Immunotherapeutics, Inc., Needham, MA.). C3b, the proteolytically activated form of C3, was generated by limited tryptic cleavage of C3 and purified on a Mono Q 5/5 (Amersham Biosciences) column as previously described (16Sahu A. Isaacs S.N. Soulika A.M. Lambris J.D. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 5596-5604PubMed Google Scholar). C4b, the proteolytically activated form of C4, was purchased from Calbiochem. Purity of all the proteins exceeded 95%, as judged by SDS-PAGE analysis. Cloning, Expression, Purification, and Refolding of the Soluble Form of Herpesvirus Saimiri Complement Control Protein Homolog (sCCPH) and the R118A Mutant—The herpesvirus saimiri CCPH gene (CCP domains 1-4) was PCR-amplified from the CCPH clone pCEX-1 (a kind gift of Drs. John Lambris, Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA and Jens-Christian Albrecht, Institut für Klinische und Molekulare Virologie, Erlangen, Germany) with specific primers 5′-GGAATTCAGCTGTCCTACACGTAACCAG-3′ (the EcoRI site is underlined) and 5′-CCGCTCGAGCATACATTCAGGAATAGCTGG-3′ (the XhoI site is underlined) and cloned into the bacterial expression vector pET29 at the EcoRI and XhoI sites. The R118A mutant was constructed from this clone by using the QuikChange II site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). After verifying the fidelity of both the clones by DNA sequencing, they were transformed into Escherichia coli BL21 cells for expression. Expression of sCCPH and R118A mutant (numbering according to the mature protein sequence (29Albrecht J.C. Fleckenstein B. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 3937-3940Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)) was performed as described below. A single colony of the bacterial clone expressing sCCPH or the mutant protein was inoculated into 5 ml of LB-kanamycin media (LB media containing 30 μg/ml kanamycin) and grown overnight at 37 °C, and 2 ml of this culture was transferred into 100 ml of LB-kanamycin. The culture was grown for 2 h at 37°C, and thereafter 10 ml of the culture was transferred to 600 ml of LB-kanamycin and grown at 37 °C until the optical density reached 0.6 at A600. Protein expression was induced by the addition of 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and the induced culture was further grown for 4 h. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 8000 rpm at 4 °C. For purification of the expressed proteins, frozen cell pellets (∼16 g) were gently resuspended in 48 ml of 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The cell suspension was then treated with lysozyme (0.3 mg/ml), stirred for 20 min, mixed with deoxycholic acid (1.3 mg/g), and stored at 37 °C for 30 min. After incubation, the lysate was sonicated with 15 pulses of 15 s each and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The pellet containing the inclusion bodies was washed twice with 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 10 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, and 0.5% Triton X-100 and solubilized in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, and 8 m urea. The sample was then centrifuged at 4 °C for 30 min at 11,000 rpm, and the supernatant obtained was loaded onto a nickel nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose column (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) pre-equilibrated with 100 mm NaH2PO4, 10 mm Tris, 8 m urea, pH 8.0. The column was washed with the binding buffer containing 10 mm imidazole, and the bound protein was eluted with 400 mm imidazole. The purified proteins were refolded by using a rapid dilution method (1:50) described previously (33White J. Lukacik P. Esser D. Steward M. Giddings N. Bright J.R. Fritchley S.J. Morgan B.P. Lea S.M. Smith G.P. Smith R.A. Protein Sci. 2004; 13: 2406-2415Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In brief, the purified protein was added dropwise with continuous stirring into a refolding buffer containing 0.02 m ethanolamine, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 m l-arginine, 1 mm reduced glutathione, and 1 mm oxidized glutathione, pH 11.0. The sample was then left static for 36 h. The refolded sample was concentrated, dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline, and subjected to SDS-PAGE, circular dichroism, and sequencing and mass analysis by mass spectrometry (17Mullick J. Bernet J. Panse Y. Hallihosur S. Singh A.K. Sahu A. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 12382-12393Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Measurement of Factor I Cofactor Activity—Analysis of factor I cofactor activities of sCCPH and the mutant was essentially performed as described (34Bernet J. Mullick J. Panse Y. Parab P.B. Sahu A. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 9446-9457Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). These assays were performed in physiological ionic strength buffer (phosphate-buffered saline). Measurement of Decay-accelerating Activity—The classical pathway (CP) decay-accelerating activity of sCCPH and the R118A mutant were determined by forming EAC142 (35Pan Q. Ebanks R.O. Isenman D.E. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 2518-2527Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), and the alternative pathway (AP) C3-convertase decay-accelerating activity was measured by forming C3b,Bb on sheep (ES) as well as rabbit (ER) erythrocytes. The details of these methods have been described previously (17Mullick J. Bernet J. Panse Y. Hallihosur S. Singh A.K. Sahu A. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 12382-12393Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 36Pryzdial E.L. Isenman D.E. Mol. Immunol. 1986; 23: 87-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Circular Dichroism (CD)—The sCCPH and its mutant R118A were subjected to CD spectra in the far UV region (190-360 nm) using a Jasco J18 spectropolarimeter with a cylindrical quartz cell with a path length of 0.01 cm. The resolution was 1 nm, the sensitivity was 20 millidegrees, and the speed was 10 nm/min. Each presented spectrum is the measure of eight measurements. The concentration of both the proteins was 200 μg/ml in 10 mm phosphate containing 145 mm NaCl, pH 7.4. All the data were subtracted against the background data using the spectral analysis software. Flow Cytometry for Measurement of Inhibition of C3b Deposition—Inhibition of the classical and alternative pathway-mediated C3b deposition on erythrocytes by sCCPH and VCP was measured by flow cytometry (19Mullick J. Bernet J. Singh A.K. Lambris J.D. Sahu A. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 3878-3881Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). For measurement of the classical pathway-mediated C3b deposition, 5 μl of EA(109/ml in GVB2+) was mixed with 2 μl of C8-deficient human serum (Calbiochem) and 2 μm sCCPH or VCP in a total volume of 44 μl and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. The cells were washed with GVB2+, centrifuged, mixed with 100 μl of 1/100-diluted fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated F(ab′)2 anti-C3 goat IgG (Cappel Laboratories, Warrington, PA), and further incubated on ice for 1 h. After incubation, the cells were washed twice with 400 μl of GVB, resuspended in 1.0 ml of the same buffer, and analyzed on a FACS Vantage (BD Biosciences). For measurement of alternative pathway-mediated deposition of C3b, 5 μl of rabbit erythrocytes (109/ml in GVB) was mixed with 2 μl of 0.1 m MgEGTA, 3 μl of C8-deficient human serum (Calbiochem), and 30 μl of GVB or GVB containing 2 μm sCCPH or VCP and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. The cells were washed with GVB, and deposition of C3b was detected as described above. Results are expressed as mean channel fluorescence of 10,000 cells. Surface Plasmon Resonance Measurements—The kinetics of sCCPH and the R118A mutant binding to C3b and C4b was determined on the surface plasmon resonance-based biosensor BIACORE 2000 (Biacore AB, Uppsala, Sweden). The experiments were performed in phosphate-buffered saline-Tween (10 mm sodium phosphate, 145 mm NaCl, pH 7.4, containing 0.05% Tween 20) at 25 °C. For proper orientation of these proteins, the free SH groups of both C3b and C4b were biotinylated and then immobilized on the streptavidin chip (Sensor Chip SA, Biacore AB) (34Bernet J. Mullick J. Panse Y. Parab P.B. Sahu A. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 9446-9457Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). FC-2 was immobilized with C3b (1592 RU), FC-3 was immobilized with C4b (1197 RUs), and FC-1 (blank flow cell) served as the control flow cell. Because sCCPH showed very little binding to C3b, more C3b molecules were deposited onto FC-2 by forming C3-convertase (37Jokiranta T.S. Hellwage J. Koistinen V. Zipfel P.F. Meri S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27657-27662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 38Harris C.L. Abbott R.J. Smith R.A. Morgan B.P. Lea S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 2569-2578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In brief, ∼6000 RUs of C3b were deposited using three cycles of C3b deposition. In each cycle, the C3-convertase was formed by injecting a mixture of factors B and D (5 μg of B and 0.35 μg of D) and then 45 μg of native C3 was injected using the co-inject option. Deposition of C3b onto the chip was performed in veronal-buffered saline containing 1 mm NiCl2. For measurement of binding of sCCPH and the mutant protein to C3b and C4b, various concentrations of these proteins were injected for 120 s at 50 μl/min. Dissociation was measured for 180 s. The sensor chips were regenerated with 30-s pulses of 0.2 m sodium carbonate, pH 9.5. Sensograms obtained for the control flow cell (FC-1) were subtracted from the data for the flow cell immobilized with C3b or C4b, and the surface plasmon resonance data obtained were evaluated by BIAevaluation software version 4.1 using global fitting. Expression and Characterization of sCCPH—Because a large quantity of protein was required for conducting multiple assays, we chose to express HVS sCCPH in E. coli using the pET expression system. The soluble form of HVS CCPH was amplified from the HVS clone pCEX-1 and cloned into the expression vector pET29. The expressed protein was purified to homogeneity using histidine affinity (Fig. 1), and the identity of the expressed protein was confirmed by sequencing using mass spectrometry. The amino acid sequence of the expressed protein was consistent with the predicted sequence confirming the identity; the sequence coverage obtained was 86%. The expressed protein was refolded according to the method described by R. A. Smith and co-workers (33White J. Lukacik P. Esser D. Steward M. Giddings N. Bright J.R. Fritchley S.J. Morgan B.P. Lea S.M. Smith G.P. Smith R.A. Protein Sci. 2004; 13: 2406-2415Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). This method typically provided a 20% yield. Analysis of the refolded protein by circular dichroism yielded a peak around 230 nm, which is a characteristic of CCP domains (39Kirkitadze M.D. Krych M. Uhrin D. Dryden D.T. Smith B.O. Cooper A. Wang X. Hauhart R. Atkinson J.P. Barlow P.N. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 7019-7031Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). These data confirmed proper folding of the protein. The expressed protein was >95% pure as judged by SDS-PAGE analysis, and it migrated as a single band of 32,000 Da on the gel. Further mass analysis by mass spectrometry confirmed that its molecular mass was similar to its calculated mass (within error <1%) (Fig. 1). Previously it has been shown that the membrane form of CCPH inhibits C3d deposition on the target cells (30Fodor W.L. Rollins S.A. Biancocaron S. Rother R.P. Guilmette E.R. Burton W.V. Albrecht J.C.

To verify if the refolded protein is biologically active, we tested its ability to inhibit C3b deposition on erythrocytes during complement activation. As depicted in Fig. 2, sCCPH inhibited both the classical as well as alternative pathway-mediated deposition of C3b on erythrocytes. Importantly, the data indicated that sCCPH was more active than VCP in inhibiting the alternative pathway-mediated deposition of C3b. Kinetic Analysis of Interaction of sCCPH with Complement Proteins C3b and C4b—The human complement control proteins inactivate complement by targeting C3b and/or C4b. Because sCCPH inhibited C3b deposition mediated by both the classical and alternative pathways, we sought to analyze its interaction with C3b and C4b by surface plasmon resonance technology. In this assay, C3b and C4b were immobilized in their physiological orientation on a streptavidin chip by labeling their free SH groups with biotin (34Bernet J. Mullick J. Panse Y. Parab P.B. Sahu A. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 9446-9457Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), and sCCPH was injected over the chip to measure binding. The sCCPH showed good binding to C4b but very weak binding to C3b (Fig. 3, upper left panel). Binding data obtained by injecting various concentrations of sCCPH fitted well to 1:1 binding model (ka = 158; kd = 5.32 × 10−3; KD = 3.35 × 10−5 ; χ2 = 0.273). Because the binding response was very low, we further deposited C3b on the sensor chip to increase the response and reevaluate affinity. More C3b was deposited by forming AP C3-convertase on the chip and flowing native C3 (37Jokiranta T.S. Hellwage J. Koistinen V. Zipfel P.F. Meri S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27657-27662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 38Harris C.L. Abbott R.J. Smith R.A. Morgan B.P. Lea S.M. J. Biol.

Three cycles of AP amplification resulted in deposition of ∼6000 RUs of C3b (Fig. 3, upper right panel); non-covalently associated Bb and C3b were removed by injection of brief pulses of 0.2 m sodium carbonate, pH 9.5. As expected, deposition of C3b using this approach resulted in a decaying surface, suggesting that C3b was attached to the surface by forming ester linkages (40Sahu A. Pangburn M.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28997-29002Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When sCCPH was flown over the enzyme-coupled C3b, it showed good binding response (Fig. 3, lower left panel). To calculate affinities for C3b and C4b, various concentrations of sCCPH were injected over the chip. The sCCPH bound to both C3b and C4b in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3). Global fitting analysis of the sensograms showed a good fit of sCCPH-C3b data to the 1:1 binding model with a drifting base line (χ2 = 1.83), but sCCPH-C4b data could not be fitted to 1:1 model, and therefore, it was evaluated by steady-state analysis. These data indicated that sCCPH-C3b interaction follows a simple 1:1 binding model, whereas sCCPH-C4b interaction is complex. A comparison of the affinities showed that sCCPH has a 24-fold higher affinity for C4b than C3b (Table 1).TABLE 1Kinetic and affinity data for the interactions of sCCPH,"

In the present study, we have extensively tested the relationship between the intranuclear mobility of the NF-κB subunit p65 and binding to its consensus target sequence. The affinity of p65 for this binding site is altered by mutation of specific acetylation sites, so these mutants provide a model system to study the relationship between specific DNA binding affinity and intranuclear mobility. DNA binding affinity was measured in vitro using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay-based method, and intranuclear mobility was measured using the fluorescence recovery after photobleaching technique on yellow fluorescent protein-tagged p65 constructs. A negative correlation was observed between DNA binding affinity and intranuclear mobility of p65 acetylation site mutants. However, moving the yellow fluorescent protein tag from the C terminus of p65 to the N terminus resulted in an increased mobility but did not significantly affect DNA binding affinity. Thus, all changes in DNA binding affinity produce alterations in mobility, but not vice versa. Finally, a positive correlation was observed between mobility and the randomness of the intranuclear distribution of p65.

The first reports on the dynamics of nuclear proteins revealed a remarkably high mobility for a variety of nuclear proteins, such as the endonuclease ERCC1/XPF (1Houtsmuller A.B. Rademakers S.

Science. 1999; 284: 958-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar), the nucleosomal binding protein HMG-17, the pre-mRNA splicing factor SF2/ASF, and the rRNA processing protein fibrillarin (2Phair R.D. Misteli T. Nature. 2000; 404: 604-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (953) Google Scholar). More information on the regulation of the mobility of nuclear proteins has come from studies on steroid receptors, which act as transcription factors upon activation by their ligand. It was shown for estrogen receptor α (3Stenoien D.L. Patel K. Mancini M.G. Dutertre M. Smith C.L. O'Malley B.W. Mancini M.A. Nat.

Houtsmuller A.B. J. Struct. Biol. 2004; 147: 50-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) that activation by ligand decreases the mobility of the receptor and that the ligand-binding domain and DNA-binding domain are important for this effect. In addition, for GR, it was shown that regional differences in mobility occur, with the lowest mobility found in regions with the highest concentration of receptors (9Schaaf M.J. Lewis-Tuffin L.J. Cidlowski J.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 2005; 19: 1501-1515Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar).It is commonly believed that transcription factors in the nucleus freely diffuse between sites to which they transiently bind (7Sprague B.L. Pego R.L. Stavreva D.A. McNally J.G. Biophys. J. 2004; 86: 3473-3495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar, 10Phair R.D. Scaffidi P. Elbi C. Vecerova J. Dey A. Ozato K. Brown D.T. Hager G. Bustin M. Misteli T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 6393-6402Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). The association with these binding sites is suggested to be the most important determinant of the average transcription factor mobility in the nucleus as measured by FRAP. The nature of these sites has not yet been elucidated, but it has been suggested that DNA binding is the main determinant of transcription factor mobility in the nucleus (7Sprague B.L. Pego R.L. Stavreva D.A. McNally J.G. Biophys. J. 2004; 86: 3473-3495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar, 10Phair R.D. Scaffidi P. Elbi C. Vecerova J. Dey A. Ozato K. Brown D.T. Hager G. Bustin M. Misteli T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 6393-6402Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Recent studies using the ChIP-chip technology have revealed a surprisingly high number of p65 DNA-binding sites in the human genome (∼20,000) (11Martone R. Euskirchen G. Bertone P. Hartman S. Royce T.E. Luscombe N.M. Rinn J.L. Nelson F.K. Miller P. Gerstein M. Weissman S. Snyder M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 12247-12252Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Of these sites, 35% contain a canonical p65 target sequence, whereas the other 65% probably reflect sites at which p65 binds through interaction with other proteins that associate with specific DNA sites. Only one-third of the p65 binding sites were found within 5 kb upstream of a transcription start site, and 38% of the binding sites lie near or within genes that are not regulated after activation of p65 by tumor necrosis factor α (11Martone R. Euskirchen G. Bertone P. Hartman S. Royce T.E. Luscombe N.M. Rinn J.L. Nelson F.K. Miller P. Gerstein M. Weissman S. Snyder M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 12247-12252Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Thus, the function of a majority of p65 binding sites remains to be elucidated. Similarly high numbers of binding sites have been found for SP-1, c-Myc, CREB, and E2F1, also by application of the ChIP-chip technology (12Euskirchen G. Royce T.E. Bertone P. Martone R. Rinn J.L.

Cell. 2004; 116: 499-509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (930) Google Scholar).Because of this high number of transcription factor DNA-binding sites, we hypothesize that association with DNA determines the intranuclear mobility of transcription factors. Indeed, deletion of the DNA-binding domain of GR (6Schaaf M.J. Cidlowski J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 1922-1934Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) and the yeast transcription factor Ace1p (15Karpova T.S. Chen T.Y. Sprague B.L. McNally J.G. EMBO Rep. 2004; 5: 1064-1070Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and a point mutation in the androgen receptor DNA-binding domain (8Farla P. Hersmus R. Geverts B. Mari P.O. Nigg A.L. Dubbink H.J. Trapman J. Houtsmuller A.B. J. Struct. Biol. 2004; 147: 50-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) result in increased mobility of the protein. These deletions, however, were relatively large, which could result in alterations in the conformation of other domains of the protein or misfolding. For example, for GR, it was found that deletion of the DNA-binding domain results in a protein that forms aggregates in the nucleus and cytoplasm, which probably reflects accumulations of misfolded proteins (9Schaaf M.J. Lewis-Tuffin L.J. Cidlowski J.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 2005; 19: 1501-1515Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the mutation described above resulted in loss of DNA binding, and the effect of increasing the DNA binding affinity has not been studied.In the present study, we have extensively tested the relationship between intranuclear mobility and specific DNA binding, using the NF-κB subunit p65 as a model system. NF-κB plays a central role in induction of genes that are involved in immune and inflammatory responses (16Baldwin Jr., A.S. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: 3-6Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Baldwin Jr., A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (5542) Google Scholar). The prototypical NF-κB is a p50/p65 heterodimer, but p65 homodimers occur and are functional as well (18Ganchi P.A. Sun S.C. Greene W.C. Ballard D.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7826-7835Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). NF-κB is sequestered in the cytoplasm by its inhibitor IκB, which in response to inflammatory stimuli is phosphorylated and targeted for degradation by the proteasome in response to inflammatory stimuli (17Baldwin Jr., A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (5542) Google Scholar). NF-κB subsequently translocates to the nucleus and transactivates target genes.Acetylation of p65 in vivo appears to be a mechanism for regulation of its transcriptional activity (19Chen L.F. Greene W.C. J. Mol. Med. 2003; 81: 549-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 20Greene W.C. Chen L.F. Novartis Found. Symp. 2004; 259: 208-217Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Five lysine residues can be targeted for acetylation: Lys-122, Lys-123, Lys-218, Lys-221, and Lys-310. The crystal structure of a p65/p50 heterodimer bound to the κB site of the immunoglobulin light chain gene promoter demonstrates that the first four residues contact the DNA backbone, whereas Lys-310 is not involved in DNA binding (21Chen F.E. Huang D.B. Chen Y.Q. Ghosh G. Nature. 1998; 391: 410-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar, 22Chen Y.Q. Ghosh S. Ghosh G. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 67-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Residues Lys-122 and Lys-123 can be acetylated by p300 and p300/CBP-associated factor, which decreases the DNA binding affinity of p65 as demonstrated by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) (23Kiernan R. Bres V. Ng R.W. Coudart M.P. El Messaoudi S. Sardet C. Jin D.Y. Emiliani S. Benkirane M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2758-2766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). Acetylation of Lys-218 and Lys-221 can occur through p300 and CREB-binding protein (but not p300/CBP-associated factor), resulting in increased DNA binding affinity, also demonstrated by EMSA (24Chen L.F. Mu Y. Greene W.C. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6539-6548Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar, 25Chen L. Fischle W. Verdin E. Greene W.C. Science. 2001; 293: 1653-1657Crossref PubMed Scopus (1038) Google Scholar). Acetylation of Lys-310 does not alter DNA binding but does increase the transcriptional activity of p65, probably by increasing the affinity for a transcriptional coactivator (24Chen L.F. Mu Y. Greene W.C. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6539-6548Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar, 25Chen L. Fischle W. Verdin E. Greene W.C. Science. 2001; 293: 1653-1657Crossref PubMed Scopus (1038) Google Scholar). Mutating these lysine residues to arginine prevents acetylation of the amino acid but retains the positive charge of this residue. In contrast, mutation to alanine neutralizes the positive charge, thereby mimicking this effect of acetylation.It has been shown that by introducing these mutations into p65, it is possible to either increase or decrease its binding affinity for the κB consensus sites (23Kiernan R. Bres V. Ng R.W. Coudart M.P. El Messaoudi S. Sardet C. Jin D.Y. Emiliani S. Benkirane M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2758-2766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar, 24Chen L.F. Mu Y. Greene W.C.

These mutants then provide a model system that can be exploited to test the relationship between specific DNA binding affinity and intranuclear mobility. Using this approach, in the present study, a clear relationship was observed between DNA binding and intranuclear mobility. However, comparison between p65 that was N-terminally tagged with yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) and p65 C-terminally tagged with YFP demonstrates that DNA binding affinity is not the sole determinant of intranuclear mobility of transcription factors and that additional factors like interaction with other nuclear proteins may also alter mobility.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmids—Synthesis of the expression plasmid pp65-EYFP, encoding p65 with YFP tagged at its C terminus, was described previously (26Garside H. Stevens A. Farrow S. Normand C. Houle B. Berry A. Maschera B. Ray D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 50050-50059Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Briefly, the p65 coding sequence was subcloned from plasmid pp65-EGFP (construction described by Nelson et al. (27Nelson G. Wilde G.J. Spiller D.G. Kennedy S.M. Ray D.W. Sullivan E. Unitt J.F. White M.R. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 2495-2503Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar)) into pEYFP-N1 (Clontech) using HindIII and BamHI restriction sites.The expression plasmid pEYFP-p65, encoding p65 with YFP tagged at its N terminus, was constructed by PCR amplification of the p65 coding sequence from the expression vector pCMV4-p65 (28Ruben S.M. Dillon P.J. Schreck R. Henkel T. Chen C.H. Maher M. Baeuerle P.A. Rosen C.A. Science. 1991; 251: 1490-1493Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). The primer sequences used were GATTAGGATCCGACGAACTGTTCCCC CTCATC (containing the BamHI site and removing the ATG from p65) and CTATAGAATAGGGCCCTCTAGATGCATGCTCG (containing the XbaI site). The PCR product was cloned into the vector pEYFP-C1 (BD Biosciences Clontech) by using BamHI and XbaI restriction sites.Mutated versions of this vector were made by site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For expression of non-tagged p65, a stop codon was introduced into the plasmid pp65-EYFP immediately behind the p65 coding sequence using site-directed mutagenesis. All plasmids were verified by sequence analysis. Wild type p65 sequence was identical to the previously described sequence (29Schmid R.M. Perkins N.D. Duckett C.S. Andrews P.C. Nabel G.J. Nature. 1991; 352: 733-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar).For reporter assays, pNF-κB-Luc (Stratagene) was used, which contains five repeats of an NF-κB-sensitive enhancer element (TGGGGACTTTCCGC) upstream of the TATA box, controlling the expression of luciferase. The empty expression vector pcDNA3 (containing a cytomegalovirus promoter like pp65-EYFP and pEYFP-p65) was used as a control for the amount of DNA.Cell Culture and Transfection—COS-1 cells were grown as described previously (9Schaaf M.J. Lewis-Tuffin L.J. Cidlowski J.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 2005; 19: 1501-1515Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Transfections were performed using Fugene 6 (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. A Fugene/DNA mixture was made in Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) as indicated for each experiment. Cells were incubated with this mixture for 5 h at 37 °C and refed with supplemented Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium.Luciferase Reporter Assays—Cells were plated in 9.6-cm2 wells (1.5 × 105 cells/well) 1 day before transfection. Each well was transfected using 3 μl of Fugene 6, 0.5 μg of the reporter plasmid pκB-luc, and the indicated amounts of p65 or YFP-tagged p65 expression vector or a mutated version of one of these vectors. The total amount of transfected DNA was kept at 1.5 μg by adding pcDNA3. Twenty-four hours after the start of the transfection, cells were trypsinized and plated in 96-well plates (50 × 103 cells/well). Each individual transfection was plated in duplicate. After incubation at 37 °C for 6 h, luminescence was measured using the Firelite dual luminescence reporter gene assay system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Luminescence was read on a Wallac 1450 Microbeta Trilux luminescence counter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). In each experiment, duplicates were averaged. Data shown are average ± S.E. of at least three individual experiments.Western Blots—Aliquots of each nuclear extract were analyzed by Western blotting. Using 8% polyacrylamide gels (Invitrogen), 5 μg of protein was resolved by electrophoresis, and samples were subsequently transferred electrophoretically to nitrocellulose membranes (Invitrogen). Membranes were blocked at room temperature for 30 min in Tris-buffered saline with Tween 20 (TBST; 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20) containing 5% nonfat dry milk. Subsequently, the membrane was incubated overnight at 4 °C with either the p65 antibody (C-20 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA)) or the green fluorescent protein antibody (FL (Santa Cruz Biotechnology)) at a dilution of 1:1000 or 1:200, respectively in TBST containing 5% nonfat dry milk. After three 15-min washes in TBST containing 5% nonfat dry milk, the membrane was incubated with a horseradish peroxidase-labeled goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Amersham Bio-sciences; 1:2000 dilution in TBST containing 5% nonfat dry milk) for 1.5 h at room temperature. Finally, after three 15-min washes in TBST, immunoreactivity was visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL; Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions.NF-κB DNA Binding Assay—Cells were plated in 78.5-cm2 dishes (7.5 × 105 cells/dish) 1 day before transfection. For transfection, 15 μl of Fugene and 5 μg of pp65-YFP or a mutated version of this vector was used per dish. One day later, nuclear extracts were prepared using a method established by Andrews and Faller (30Andrews N.C. Faller D.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (2209) Google Scholar). Cells were scraped off in 1 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, spun down (1 min, 13,000 rpm, 4 °C), and resuspended in 200 μl of buffer A (10 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.9, at 4 °C, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, Protease Inhibitor Mixture Set III (1:1000; Calbiochem)). Cells were incubated on ice for 10 min, vortexed for 10 s, and spun down (1 min, 13,000 rpm, 4 °C). The pellet was resuspended in 200 μl of buffer C (20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.9, 25% glycerol, 420 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, Protease Inhibitor Mixture Set III (1:1000; Calbiochem)) and incubated on ice for 20 min. After centrifugation (2 min, 13,000 rpm, 4 °C), supernatants were collected and stored at −20 °C.DNA binding affinity was measured using the TransAM NF-κB Chemi kit (Active Motif) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Serial dilutions (1:2) were made of the nuclear extracts, and 20 μl of each dilution and 30 μl of binding buffer were added to a microtiter plate coated with an oligonucleotide containing the κB site of the immunoglobulin light chain gene promoter (GGGACTTTCC). After incubation at room temperature for 1 h, wells were washed three times in 200 μl of washing buffer. Subsequently, wells were incubated with NF-κB antibody (1:1000) for 1 h and were washed three times in washing buffer. After a 1-h incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:10,000), wells were washed four times, chemiluminescent substrate was added, and luminescence was measured using a Wallac 1450 Microbeta Trilux luminescence counter (PerkinElmer).In order to measure relative p65-YFP protein levels in the nuclear extracts, the yellow fluorescence in the nuclear extracts was measured using a Wallac 1420 multilabel counter, using excitation at 485 nm and a 535-nm long pass filter for the emission (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). In a control experiment, it was verified that the YFP concentration in the sample was proportional to the measured fluorescence level. Fluorescence levels were corrected for total protein concentration in the sample, and subsequently the luminescence levels from the DNA binding assay were plotted against the fluorescence level. From these curves, the EC50 values were calculated for each mutant. In each experiment, EC50 values were corrected for the EC50 of p65-YFP, which was set at 100%. Data shown are average ± S.E. of at least three individual experiments. Statistical analysis of these experiments was performed on log-transformed data.Interleukin-8 (IL-8) Immunoassay—Quantitative determination of IL-8 concentrations in cell culture supernatants was performed using the Quantikine IL-8 immunoassay (R&D Systems) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were treated as described for the luciferase reporter assay. Before harvesting the cells for the luciferase assay, supernatants (each treatment in triplicate) were frozen and kept at −20 °C until the assay was performed. Thawed samples and IL-8 standard dilutions (50 μl) were added to the provided IL-8 monoclonal antibody-coated microtiter plate containing 100 μl of assay diluent buffer. An enzyme-linked polyclonal antibody was added, and the plates were incubated at room temperature for 2.5 h. After six washes, a substrate solution was added, plates were incubated for 30 min, a stop solution was added, and optical densities were determined by measuring absorbance at 450 nm using a Thermo Max Microplate Reader using Softmax software (Molecular Devices). Using an IL-8 standard curve, IL-8 concentrations in the supernatants were calculated. Data shown are average ± S.E. of triplicate measurements.Confocal Microscopy—COS-1 cells were plated in 9.6-cm2 dishes containing glass bottoms (MatTek Corp., 1.5 × 105 cells/dish). One day later, 1 μg of DNA was transfected using the Fugene method, and the next day cells were studied by confocal microscopy. Cells were observed using a Leica TCS-4D confocal laser-scanning microscope, equipped with a Uniphase argon gas laser, using a Plan-Apochromat ×63 water immersion objective (1.4 numeric aperture). Cells expressing YFP-tagged proteins were excited at 488 nm, and emission was collected using a 525 ± 25-nm band pass filter.FRAP—For determining the mobility of YFP-tagged proteins, FRAP was performed as described previously (6Schaaf M.J. Cidlowski J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 1922-1934Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Images were taken every 290.3 ms at a resolution of 128 × 128 pixels. After the first image, two consecutive images were taken of a selected square region of fixed size in the nucleus using maximal laser power (0.8 milliwatt, measured at the objective), resulting in bleaching of the fluorescent molecules in this region. Average fluorescence intensity per pixel in the bleached region and in the total nucleus was determined at every time point using Leica Confocal Software (available on the World Wide Web at www.leica-microsystems.com/Confocal_Microscopes). In each experiment, at least 10 cells per condition were analyzed (see Fig. 4B). To correct for differences in expression level between individual cells, fluorescence data for the bleached region and the total nucleus were normalized to the prebleaching level. At all time points, data were normalized to the fluorescence in the total nucleus in order to correct for the loss in fluorescence due to the bleach pulse and the imaging (see Fig. 4C). Using these data, the t½ of maximal recovery was determined, which is defined as the time point after bleaching at which the normalized fluorescence has increased to half the amount of the maximal recovery. Every t½ shown is an average ± S.E. of at least three experiments.Analysis of Intranuclear Protein Distribution—A previously described method for quantitating the randomness of protein distribution in the nucleus was used (9Schaaf M.J. Lewis-Tuffin L.J. Cidlowski J.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 2005; 19: 1501-1515Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Images of transfected cells were taken at a resolution of 512 × 512 pixels and analyzed using the program ImageJ (developed at the National Institutes of Health and available on the World Wide Web at rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/). Fluorescence intensity levels were measured on individual points along a line through the nucleus (maximal in length without touching a nucleolus). From all individual measurements along this line, an S.D. and average could be calculated. The quotient of these numbers (the coefficient of variation (CV)) was used as a measure for the degree of randomness of nuclear distribution. In each experiment, at least 10 cells were chosen randomly, and the results were averaged.Statistical Analysis—Statistical analysis was performed by one-way or two-way ANOVA. Where ANOVA indicated statistical significance, the Bonferroni post hoc test was used to compare individual groups. This test was done using the GraphPad online calculator (available on the World Wide Web at www.graphpad.com/quickcalcs/posttest1.cfm) (see also Ref. 31Hsu J.C. Multiple Comparisons: Theory and Methods. Chapman and Hall, London, UK1996: 13Google Scholar). Statistical significance was accepted at p < 0.05.RESULTSCharacterization of p65-YFPIn the present study, a fusion protein was used consisting of the NF-κB subunit p65 C-terminally tagged with YFP. Construction of this p65-YFP fusion protein has previously been described (26Garside H. Stevens A. Farrow S. Normand C. Houle B. Berry A. Maschera B. Ray D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 50050-50059Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). First, the activity of this construct on an NF-κB-responsive promoter was studied. The results are shown in Fig. 1A. Endogenous p65 does not significantly induce transactivation of this promoter (due to inactivation by endogenous IκB), but overexpression of p65 results in considerable induction. Maximum induction (approximately 15-fold) is reached with transfection of 0.1 μg of plasmid. Induction by the tagged protein is comparable, but the maximum is slightly lower. Subsequently, protein samples were extracted from the nuclei, and Western blots were performed using antibodies against p65 or YFP (Fig. 1B). Using the p65 antibody, single bands of the expected size were detected for both p65 and p65-YFP-transfected cells. The YFP antibody stained one major band in p65-YFP transfected cells, indicating that virtually all yellow fluorescence observed in the nucleus is emitted from the full-length intact p65-YFP.FIGURE 1Characterization of p65-YFP.

To understand the mechanisms underlying the function of this family of transcriptional regulators, we have identified the tobacco 14-3-3 isoform G as the first protein interacting with a DBP factor. 14-3-3 recognition involves the N-terminal region of DBP1, which also supports the DNA binding activity attributed to DBP1. The relevance of this interaction is reinforced by its conservation in Arabidopsis plants, where the closest relative of DBP1 in this species also interacts with a homologous 14-3-3 protein through its N-terminal region. Furthermore, we show that in planta 14-3-3 G is directly involved in regulating DBP1 function by promoting nuclear export and subsequent cytoplasmic retention of DBP1 under conditions that in turn alleviate DBP1-mediated repression of target gene expression.

To cope with adverse environmental growth conditions, plants have evolved efficient defense mechanisms that imply changes in the expression of numerous genes that are mostly controlled at the transcriptional level (1Malek K. Levine A. Eulgem T. Morgan A. Schmid J. Lawton K.A. Dangl J.L. Dietrich R.A. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar, 2Mahalingam R. Gómez-Buitrago A. Eckardt N. Shah N. Guevara-García A. Day P. Raina R. Fedoroff N.V. Genome Biol. 2003; 4: R20Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transcription factors are key components of these signaling processes as they are responsible for ultimately executing the transcriptional outputs necessary to mount the pursued adaptation. Upon signal perception, the earliest changes in transcription must be the result of the activity of preexisting transcription factors that are functionally modulated in response to the corresponding signal. Post-translational modifications, particularly protein phosphorylation-dephosphorylation and protein-protein interactions largely account for the regulation of transcription factor function and affect their subcellular localization, stability, DNA binding activity, and/or interactions with additional protein partners. DBP1 (DNA-binding protein phosphatase 1) was recently identified in tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) as the first representative of a novel class of transcription factors endowed with protein phosphatase activity (3Carrasco J.L. Ancillo G. Mayda E. Vera P. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3376-3384Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). DBP1 was shown to be involved in the transcriptional modulation of a plant defense gene, the CEVI1 gene, whose transcription is activated in response to detachment (in excised leaf sections) as well as during the course of a compatible plant-virus interaction (4Mayda E. Marqués C. Conejero V. Vera P. Mol. Plant-Microbe Interact. 2000; 13: 23-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). DBP1-related proteins have been found only in plants, in both monocot and dicot species, and within each species different family members can be identified (5Carrasco J.L. Ancillo G. Castelló M.J. Vera P. Plant Physiol. 2005; 137: 602-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In all cases, the protein phosphatase 2C catalytic domain resides in the C-terminal part of the protein, whereas the N-terminal region supports the sequence-specific DNA binding activity of DBP factors (5Carrasco J.L. Ancillo G. Castelló M.J. Vera P. Plant Physiol. 2005; 137: 602-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Within this latter region a highly conserved DNC 3The abbreviations used are: DNC, DBP N-terminal core: MBP, maltose-binding protein; GFP, green fluorescent protein; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid.3The abbreviations used are: DNC, DBP N-terminal core: MBP, maltose-binding protein; GFP, green fluorescent protein; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. motif (for DBP N-terminal Core) was identified. This motif recognizes the previously identified 3a4 cis-acting element present in the promoter region of the CEVI-1 gene and might represent a structural element critical for the function of DBP proteins as transcriptional repressors (3Carrasco J.L. Ancillo G. Mayda E. Vera P. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3376-3384Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 5Carrasco J.L. Ancillo G. Castelló M.J. Vera P. Plant Physiol. 2005; 137: 602-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Toward the elucidation of the mechanistic basis underlying the regulatory function of DBP factors we report on the identification of the specific interaction of tobacco DBP1 with 14-3-3 isoform G and demonstrate that this interaction mediates a nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of DBP1. Yeast Two-hybrid Screening—The coding sequence of tobacco DBP1 was cloned into the yeast shuttle vector pAS2-1 (Clontech) in-frame with the GAL4 DNA-binding domain (GAL4BD). The resulting construct was used to transform the yeast strain PJ69-4A (6James P. Halladay J. Craig E.A. Genetics. 1996; 144: 1425-1436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A tobacco cDNA library constructed in the vector pAD-GAL4-2.1 (Stratagene) was screened following the polyethylene glycol/LiAc/single-stranded DNA protocol developed by Gietz et al. (7Gietz R.D. Triggs-Raine B. Robbins A. Graham K.C. Woods R.A. Mol. Cell Biochem. 1997; 172: 67-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Positive interacting clones were selected on histidine-lacking medium supplemented with 4 mm 3-amino-triazol (a competitive inhibitor of the HIS3 reporter gene product) and analyzed for activation of the second reporter gene, the lacZ gene, by β-galactosidase filter lift assays. Veracity and specificity of the interaction were confirmed by retransformation of the library plasmids into the original bait strain used in the screening and additional control strains. β-galactosidase activity was then measured by a quantitative liquid culture assay. An Arabidopsis thaliana two-hybrid cDNA library in the vector pACTII (Clontech) was transformed into PJ69-4α and screened following the interaction mating protocol developed by Söllick and Uhrig (8Soellick T.R. Uhrig J.F. Genome Biol. 2001; 2: 00521-00527Crossref Google Scholar), using as bait the N-terminal region of AtDBP1 expressed in PJ69-4A as a GAL4BD fusion from the pAS2-1 vector. Reporter gene expression was measured and verified as described above. In Vitro Pulldown Assay—Tobacco DBP1 was expressed in Escherichia coli as a maltose-binding protein (MBP) fusion protein and purified by affinity chromatography on amylose resin (New England Biolabs) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 14-3-3 G was expressed bearing a hexahistidine tag and purified by affinity chromatography on nickel-agarose (Qiagen). Purified proteins were combined in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.2% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, incubated for 1 h at 4 °C under gentle shaking, and sedimented with amylose resin. After extensive washing, resin-bound proteins were eluted with loading buffer and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. A tobacco crude protein extract was prepared by grinding tobacco leaves under liquid nitrogen, suspending the ground powder in the aforementioned buffer, and removing cell debris by centrifugation. Subsequent incubations were as above. The eluted fraction was subjected to Western blot detection with a polyclonal antiserum raised against Arabidopsis 14-3-3 kindly provided by Robert J. Ferl (University of Florida). Yeast Nuclear Import Assay—Nuclear targeting was analyzed in vivo using the yeast system developed by Rhee et al. (9Rhee Y. Gurel F. Gafni Y. Dingwall C. Citovsky V. Nat. Biotechnol. 2000; 18: 433-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Briefly, the protein of interest is translationally fused to a chimeric transcriptional activator, devoid of any nuclear localization signal and consisting of the DNA-binding domain of the bacterial repressor LexA and the activation domain of the yeast transcriptional activator GAL4. Thus, nuclear import will rely on the presence of a functional nuclear localization signal in the protein under study and will result in the transcriptional activation of the HIS3 and lacZ reporter genes. Plant Transient Expression Assay by Leaf Infiltration of Agrobacterium tumefaciens—The cDNA sequences encoding the full-length DBP1 protein and the C-terminal region were cloned in-frame with the smGFP4 coding sequence into the pVR-GFP-Ct Gateway vector. The 14-3-3 isoform G coding sequence was cloned into a binary vector under the control of the CaMV 35S promoter. Tobacco plants (Nicotiana benthamiana) were grown in a phytochamber under short day conditions at 23 °C/19 °C. Mid, almost fully expanded leaves were infiltrated with a suspension of A. tumefaciens C58 bearing the relevant construct in 10 mm MES, pH 5.6, 10 mm MgCl2, 150 μm acetosyringone at an A600 of 0.5. After 3-4 days, GFP fluorescence was analyzed in infiltrated leaves by confocal microscopy. For co-infiltration, Agrobacterium cultures grown separately and adjusted to an A600 of 0.5 were mixed. Identification of DBP1-interacting Proteins—To identify proteins involved in the regulatory mechanism mediated by DBP1, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen of a tobacco GAL4AD-cDNA library using full-length tobacco DBP1 as bait. From 1.5 × 106 transformants analyzed, one clone was identified that activated transcription of the HIS3 and lacZ reporter genes in a DBP1-dependent manner. As shown in Fig. 1, reporter gene activation was assayed in combination with three different baits, the original GAL4BD-DBP1 fusion, the GAL4BD alone, and a fusion of this domain to an unrelated tobacco protein of unknown function (LRP) (10Tornero P. Mayda M. Gomez M.D. Cañas L. Conejero V. Vera P. Plant J. 1996; 10: 315-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The identified cDNA clone supported growth on histidine-lacking medium (Fig. 1A) and deployment of β-galactosidase activity (Fig. 1B) only in the presence of DBP1. The isolated clone was sequenced and found to encode the 14-3-3 isoform G (GenBank™ accession number AF299256) (11Boernke F. J. Plant Physiol. 2005; 162: 161-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). 14-3-3′s are ubiquitous and conserved eukaryotic proteins encoded by multigene families, and they are recognized as important mediators in the regulation of diverse biological processes, in particular signal transduction and transcription, through direct protein-protein interactions (12Fu H. Subramanian R.R. Masters S.C. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2000; 40: 617-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (1300) Google Scholar, 13Aitken A. Baxter H. Dubois T. Clokie S. Mackie S. Mitchell K. Peden A.

Plant 14-3-3 proteins were first identified as components of sequence-specific DNA-protein complexes in Arabidopsis and maize (16de Vetten N.C. Lu G. Ferl R.J. Plant Cell. 1992; 4: 1295-1307Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 17Lu G. DeLisle A.J. de Vetten N.C. Ferl R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11490-11494Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). More recently they have been found to bind components of the general transcription machinery like TATA-binding protein and TFIIB (18Pan S. Sehnke P.C. Ferl R.J. Gurley W.B. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 1591-1602Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), as well as specific transcription factors and other regulatory proteins with a role in signaling processes related to both developmental and stress response pathways (14Roberts M.R. Trends Plant Sci. 2003; 8: 218-223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Interaction of DBP1 with 14-3-3 isoform G was confirmed in vitro in a pulldown assay using purified recombinant proteins. DBP1 was expressed in E. coli as a translational fusion to the maltose-binding protein, and 14-3-3 G was expressed bearing a hexahistidine tag (14-3-3 G-His6). As shown in Fig. 1C, purified MBP-DBP1 was able to pull along 14-3-3 G-His6 when bound to amylose resin (lane 4), whereas MBP alone was not (lane 5). Furthermore, using a crude protein extract from tobacco leaves, a polyclonal antiserum raised against Arabidopsis 14-3-3 recognized in a Western blot a band of the correct size in the fraction sedimented with amylose resin after incubation with MBP-DBP1 (Fig. 1D, lane 1), but not with MBP alone (lane 2). Identification of 14-3-3 G-interacting Domains within DBP1— 14-3-3 target recognition largely involves conserved phosphoserine-containing binding sites, and phosphopeptide motifs providing optimal 14-3-3 binding have been identified from peptide libraries (19Yaffe M.B. Rittinger K. Volinia S. Caron P.R. Aitken A. Leffers H. Gamblin S.J. Smerdon S.J. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1997; 91: 961-971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1323) Google Scholar). Although no sequence motif was found in the DBP1 amino acid sequence conforming to these consensus sites, some 14-3-3-binding proteins interact through phosphorylated motifs that diverge from these consensus sites, and even non-phosphorylated motifs may also provide high affinity binding by 14-3-3 proteins (13Aitken A. Baxter H. Dubois T. Clokie S. Mackie S. Mitchell K. Peden A. Zemlickova E. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2002; 30: 351-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). To locate those regions in DBP1 involved in the interaction with 14-3-3 G, reporter gene activation was assayed in the two-hybrid system using as baits different deletions of DBP1, as depicted in Fig. 2A. When in combination with 14-3-3 G, growth on histidine-lacking medium was observed for full-length DBP1 and the truncated proteins del1 and del2 (Fig. 2B). del1 comprises the first 87 amino acid residues that roughly encompass the N-terminal region of DBP1 previously shown to directly mediate sequence-specific DNA binding (5Carrasco J.L. Ancillo G. Castelló M.J. Vera P. Plant Physiol. 2005; 137: 602-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In contrast, del3 and del4, which both lack this region, failed to sustain the interaction. Therefore, the N-terminal region of DBP1 is necessary and sufficient for recognition of 14-3-3 G. To further delineate the motifs involved in the interaction, one additional deletion construct (del5) was assayed in the two-hybrid system for its capacity to bind 14-3-3 G. As shown in Fig. 2C, deletion of the N-terminal region up to position 64 in the context of the full-length DBP1 protein did not prevent 14-3-3 G recognition, narrowing the interaction site to the region encompassing amino acid residues from 64 to 87. We had previously shown that the highly conserved DNC motif at the end of the N-terminal region is engaged in DNA binding (5Carrasco J.L. Ancillo G. Castelló M.J. Vera P. Plant Physiol. 2005; 137: 602-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). It would be possible to envision a mechanism by which DNA binding could contribute to retaining DBP1 in the nucleus. Then, 14-3-3 G interaction might displace DBP1 from its target DNA sequence by binding to DBP1 at an overlapping site, thereby promoting DBP1 nuclear export. del1 construct lacks the C-terminal half of the DNC motif and still binds 14-3-3 G. To definitely exclude the implication of the DNC motif in the interaction with 14-3-3 G, we tested the effect of point mutations in conserved positions of the remaining part of this motif, again in the context of the full-length DBP1 protein. Simultaneously introducing alanine substitutions P83A, R86A, and S87A was previously shown to interfere with DNA recognition in vitro (5Carrasco J.L. Ancillo G. Castelló M.J. Vera P. Plant Physiol. 2005; 137: 602-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). However, these point mutations did not affect 14-3-3 G binding in the two-hybrid system (Fig. 2C, DBP1-mut1). Altogether, these results delimitate the interaction site to a 19-amino acid stretch comprised between positions 64 and 82. 14-3-3 Modulates DBP1 Nucleocytoplasmic Shuttling in Vivo— DBP1 was shown to be targeted to the nucleus in yeast using an in vivo nuclear import assay (3Carrasco J.L. Ancillo G. Mayda E. Vera P. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3376-3384Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The C-terminal half of the protein was also efficiently imported into the nucleus, consistent with the location in this region of a putative bipartite nuclear localization signal. Nuclear targeting was studied in planta by analyzing the subcellular localization of translational fusions to GFP in transient expression assays as driven by the 35S constitutive promoter upon infiltration of tobacco leaves with A. tumefaciens carrying the relevant gene construct (agroinfiltration) and subsequent detection of green fluorescence by confocal laser scanning microscopy. Both the full-length protein (GFP-DBP1) and the C-terminal half of DBP1 (GFP-DBP1Ct) were found distributed both in the cytosol and in the nucleus (Fig. 3A, left panels). This dual localization was also observed for GFP when expressed alone and is in agreement with previous observations (20Coego A. Ramírez V. Gil M.J. Flors V. Mauch-Mani B. Vera P. Plant Cell. 2005; 17: 2123-2137Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). However, whereas GFP nucleocytoplasmic distribution may be explained by diffusion of such a small protein as GFP through the nuclear membrane, the presence of the GFP-DBP1 and GFP-DBP1Ct fusions in the nucleus of transformed plant cells suggests an active nuclear import mechanism, because the size of the fusion protein is beyond the size exclusion limit of the nuclear pore complex (21Kaffman A. O'Shea E.K. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 291-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). This would be consistent with a possible dual function of DBP1 in different subcellular compartments. One of the reported functions of 14-3-3 proteins is the modulation of subcellular localization of their target proteins (22Eckardt N.A. Plant Cell. 2001; 13: 2385-2389Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3A (right panels), co-expression of 14-3-3 G clearly excluded full-length DBP1 (GFP-DBP1) from the nucleus, whereas the subcellular localization of GFP alone remained unaltered under the same conditions. As expected, a truncated DBP1 protein lacking the N-terminal region (GFP-DBP1Ct), and therefore unable to interact with 14-3-3 G, retains its nucleocytoplasmic distribution even when co-expressed with 14-3-3 G (Fig. 3A, right bottom panel). These results provide strong evidence for modulation of DBP1 nucleocytoplasmic partitioning via a direct interaction with 14-3-3 G through the N-terminal region. As discussed above, because this region is also involved in DNA recognition, 14-3-3 G might promote DBP1 nuclear export by interfering with DNA binding. Although we have excluded the direct implication of the DNC DBP1 DNA binding motif in the interaction with 14-3-3 G, the site for this interaction lies adjacent to the DNC motif, making it still possible to compromise binding to DNA. However, DNA binding seems not to directly contribute to DBP1 nuclear localization because the aforementioned mutations in DBP-mut1, which abolished DNA binding in vitro (5Carrasco J.L. Ancillo G. Castelló M.J. Vera P. Plant Physiol. 2005; 137: 602-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), did not affect DBP1 nuclear accumulation in transient expression assays (data not shown). 14-3-3′s have been shown to regulate the nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of human histone deacetylases (23Grozinger C.M. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7835-7840Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar, 24Zhao X. Ito A. Kane C.D. Liao T.S. Bolger T.A. Lemrow S.M. Means A.R. Yao T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35042-35048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), of Xenopus protein phosphatase Cdc25, (25Kumagai A. Dunphy W.G. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1067-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar), and of p27, a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor (26Sekimoto T. Fukumoto M. Yoneda Y. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1934-1942Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). 14-3-3 proteins often promote the cytoplasmic accumulation of their partners, but also nuclear targeting in others (27Tang S.J. Suen T.C. McInnes R.R. Buchwald M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25356-25363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 28Seimiya H. Sawada H. Muramatsu Y. Shimizu M. Ohko K. Yamane K. Tsuruo T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2652-2661Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). In plants, direct evidence for such a role of 14-3-3 proteins is scant. For example, the tobacco transcription factor RSG is in charge of controlling the biosynthetic pathway of gibberellic acid (GA) and shows a GA-regulated nucleocytoplasmic shuttling. A mutant version of RSG not able to interact with its 14-3-3 ligand fails to shuttle and accumulates predominantly in the nucleus even in the presence of gibberellic acid (29Igarashi D. Ishida S. Fukazawa J. Takahashi Y. Plant Cell. 2001; 13: 2483-2497Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 30Ishida S. Fukazawa J. Yuasa T. Takahashi Y. Plant Cell. 2004; 16: 2641-2651Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). In this regard, we offer further direct evidence, based on both loss- and gain-of-function experiments, that a 14-3-3 protein also regulates the nucleocytoplasmic distribution of DBP1. To complement these studies, and by means of using a yeast nuclear import system (9Rhee Y. Gurel F. Gafni Y. Dingwall C. Citovsky V. Nat. Biotechnol. 2000; 18: 433-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), we set out to test whether the tobacco 14-3-3 isoform G was intrinsically competent to enter the nucleus as a prerequisite to function in the observed shuttling of the client DBP1 protein. As shown in Fig. 3B, 14-3-3 isoform G is very efficiently imported into the yeast nucleus. VirE2, a protein from A. tumefaciens, is here used as a negative control based on its reported cytosolic localization (9Rhee Y. Gurel F. Gafni Y. Dingwall C. Citovsky V. Nat. Biotechnol. 2000; 18: 433-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The C-terminal half of DBP1, previously shown to be targeted to the nucleus with high efficiency (3Carrasco J.L. Ancillo G. Mayda E. Vera P. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3376-3384Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), was included in the assay as a positive control. This result is in agreement with the work by Paul et al. (31Paul A.L. Sehnke P.C. Ferl R.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 1735-1743Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), who have very recently found 14-3-3 κ and λ, the closest Arabidopsis relatives of 14-3-3 G, to be predominantly localized in the nucleus. 14-3-3 G Expression Is Induced in Detached Leaf Sectors and Precedes CEVI1 Gene Activation—Under resting conditions DBP1 represses transcription of CEVI1 by binding to a 3a4 cis element located in the 5′-promoter region of CEVI1 (3Carrasco J.L. Ancillo G. Mayda E. Vera P. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3376-3384Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Excision of leaf sectors from the plant results in loss of DBP1 binding to the 3a4 element and the concomitant induction of CEVI1 gene expression in the detached leaf tissue (3Carrasco J.L. Ancillo G. Mayda E. Vera P. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3376-3384Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Thus, we reasoned that if 14-3-3 G is involved in relieving CEVI1 transcriptional repression mediated by DBP1, inductive stimuli should prime the interaction of these two proteins and thereby the export and exclusion of DBP1 from the nucleus. A simple model would imply a rapid induction of 14-3-3 G gene expression under inductive conditions, preceding that of the CEVI1 gene. As discussed above, de novo synthesized 14-3-3 G would be targeted to the nucleus, where it would interact with DBP1, leading to nuclear export. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed the expression of CEVI1, DBP1, and 14-3-3 G genes by Northern hybridization (Fig. 4A). Tobacco leaf disks were excised and allowed to float on Hepes buffer as already described (4Mayda E. Marqués C. Conejero V. Vera P. Mol. Plant-Microbe Interact. 2000; 13: 23-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Both CEVI1 and 14-3-3 G were induced after leaf detachment but with different kinetics. Whereas 14-3-3 G mRNA showed a maximal level of accumulation as early as 6 h after detachment, CEVI1 mRNA continued to accumulate until 24 h. DBP1 expression was low and intriguingly was up-regulated at late times during detachment, after being slightly reduced at short times. A plausible explanation for this late induction might be the need for resetting the DBP1-mediated regulatory mechanism, although we cannot rule out the possibility that DBP1 plays additional roles in the detachment response. To validate the proposed model in vivo, we detached leaf tissue and monitored the effect on the subcellular partitioning of a GFP-DBP1 fusion compared with a GFP control. The percentage of cells showing nuclear localization of the GFP-derived fluorescence with respect to the total number of cells expressing the fusion protein was estimated at 0, 6, and 24 h directly in the detached leaf disks. As shown in Fig. 4B, detachment results in a progressive and significant reduction in the number of cells where GFP-DBP1 protein is detected in the nucleus, clearly indicating a shift in the nucleocytoplasmic balance of the protein in response to detachment, concomitant with CEVI1 gene activation. In contrast, distribution of GFP alone was not affected under the same conditions as the nucleocytoplasmic fluorescence ratio was maintained constant throughout the course of the experiment (data not shown). Interestingly, the observed subcellular relocalization of DBP1 tightly correlates with a progressive impairment of the DNA binding activity in crude protein extracts toward the 3a4 DNA probe as measured by gel shift assays (Fig. 4C). Thus, upon induction, the retention of DBP1 in the cytoplasm prevents the protein from exerting its associated DNA binding activity. Arabidopsis AtDBP1 Also Interacts with a 14-3-3 Protein— Interestingly, four genes encoding DBP1-related proteins have been identified in Arabidopsis (5Carrasco J.L. Ancillo G. Castelló M.J. Vera P. Plant Physiol. 2005; 137: 602-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), with AtDBP1 (At2g25620; GenBank™ accession number NM_128120) showing the highest similarity to tobacco DBP1. Thus, we wondered whether AtDBP1 might also interact with a similar protein as that reported above for tobacco. To answer this question, we screened an Arabidopsis GAL4AD-cDNA library with the two-hybrid system using AtDBP1 as bait. This screen resulted in the identification of several clones encoding 14-3-3 λ (At5g10450, also referred to as GRF6; accession number NM_121083; Fig. 4D). 14-3-3 λ, as already mentioned, is one of the closest Arabidopsis relatives of 14-3-3 G and may thus represent the functional ortholog from Arabidopsis. In this case the interaction was also mediated through the N-terminal region of AtDBP1, which appears again to be necessary and sufficient for the interaction to take place (Fig. 4C). These results thus reinforce the biological significance of the interaction found between DBP1 and 14-3-3. Whether the different members of these two gene families are interchangeable and able to interact remains to be demonstrated. In sum, all these observations favor the interpretation that 14-3-3 isoform G positively regulates CEVI1 gene induction in tobacco by a direct interaction with DBP1 and a subsequent nuclear export of the complex to the cytoplasm. Thus, we propose a model, depicted in Fig. 5, in which in healthy leaves DBP1 is bound to the CEVI1 promoter to repress transcription (3Carrasco J.L. Ancillo G. Mayda E. Vera P. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3376-3384Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Upon excision/detachment of leaf sectors, and very likely also in response to infection by a compatible viral pathogen, expression of 14-3-3 G would be primed with the corresponding accumulation of the protein in the nucleus, where it interacts with DBP1. As a result of this interaction, the protein complex would be exported from the nucleus and sequester DBP1 in the cytoplasm, thereby preventing binding to the CEVI1 promoter and eventually relieving CEVI1 repression. Whether the sole interaction of DBP1 with 14-3-3 is sufficient to trigger this mechanism or alternatively requires additional partners, and also what other defense-related genes may be regulated in the same way, remain our challenges for the future.

https://openalex.org/W2093744993,"Tick carboxypeptidase inhibitor (TCI) is a small, disulfide-rich protein that selectively inhibits metallocarboxypeptidases and strongly accelerates the fibrinolysis of blood clots. TCI consists of two domains that are structurally very similar, each containing three disulfide bonds arranged in an almost identical fashion. The oxidative folding and reductive unfolding pathways of TCI and its separated domains have been characterized by kinetic and structural analysis of the acid-trapped folding intermediates. TCI folding proceeds through a sequential formation of 1-, 2-, 3-, 4-, 5-, and 6-disulfide species to reach the native form. Folding intermediates of TCI comprise two predominant 3-disulfide species (named IIIa and IIIb) and a major 6-disulfide scrambled isomer (Xa) that consecutively accumulate along the reaction and are strongly prevented by the presence of protein disulfide isomerase. This study demonstrates that IIIa and IIIb are 3-disulfide species containing the native disulfide pairings of the N- and C-terminal domains of TCI, respectively, and explains why the two domains of TCI fold sequentially and independently. Also, we show that the reductive unfolding of TCI undergoes two main independent unfolding events through the formation of IIIa and IIIb intermediates. Together, the comparison of the folding, stability, and inhibitory activity of TCI with those of the isolated domains reveals the reasons behind the two-domain nature of this protein: both domains contribute to the specificity and high affinity of its double-headed binding to carboxypeptidases. The results obtained herein provide valuable information for the design of more potent and selective TCI molecules.

The results obtained herein provide valuable information for the design of more potent and selective TCI molecules. The mechanism by which an unfolded protein achieves its native state is one of the most complex problems in structural biology. Understanding the sequence of folding events in proteins may not only help to predict protein structures from amino acid sequences but also provide invaluable information to a variety of related fields, such as protein design or protein misfolding associated with pathological diseases (1Onuchic J.N. Wolynes P.G. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2004; 14: 70-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (1004) Google Scholar, 2Ross C.A. Poirier M.A. Nat. Med. 2004; 10: S10-S17Crossref PubMed Scopus (2504) Google Scholar). A number of studies concerning folding have been focused on small, disulfide-rich proteins, given that the chemistry of disulfide bond formation allows the trapping and subsequent characterization of the folding intermediates that accumulate, something difficult to attain with disulfide-free proteins (3Arolas J.L. Aviles F.X. Chang J.Y. Ventura S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2006; 31: 292-301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 4Creighton T.E. Biol. Chem. 1997; 378: 731-744PubMed Google Scholar). In oxidative folding, reduced and denatured proteins are allowed to recover both its native disulfide bonds and native structures in the absence or presence of redox agents. Bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor, ribonuclease A, lysozyme, α-lactalbumin, and hirudin have been extensively investigated using this methodology (5Chang J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 120-126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 6Chatrenet B. Chang J.Y. J. Biol.

A. 2001; 98: 2312-2316Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The heterogeneity and structures of the intermediates that occur during the process define their respective folding landscapes (10Chang J.Y. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 4522-4529Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Although most of the analyzed proteins comprise a small, single-domain fold containing three or four disulfide bonds, a great diversity of folding mechanisms is observed among them. Bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor-like proteins fold through a few disulfide intermediates that adopt native disulfide pairings and native-like (sub)structures (11Creighton T.E. Darby N.J. Kemmink J. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 110-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 12Weissman J.S. Kim P.S. Science. 1991; 253: 1386-1393Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). These intermediates seem to funnel protein conformations toward the native state and prevent the accumulation of non-native disulfide (scrambled) isomers. In contrast, the folding of hirudin-like proteins (e.g. tick anticoagulant peptide and potato carboxypeptidase inhibitor) displays a far more heterogeneous population of intermediates (at least 20 out of 74 possible) that includes scrambled isomers (13Chang J.Y. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11702-11709Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 14Venhudova G. Canals F. Querol E. Aviles F.X. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11683-11690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Conversion of these latter species into the native protein usually represents the rate-limiting step of the folding reaction. Finally, other disulfide-rich proteins such as epidermal growth factor or leech carboxypeptidase inhibitor are characterized by the presence of both native-like intermediates and scrambled isomers, showing similarities to both the folding of bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor and hirudin (15Chang J.Y.

TCI strongly inhibits plasma CPB (known also as thrombin-activable fibrinolysis inhibitor, TAFI), a well known attenuator of fibrinolysis (18Marx P.F. Curr. Med. Chem. 2004; 11: 2335-2348Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). It is therefore likely to be involved in the maintenance of the liquid state of blood during the feeding and digestion. Accordingly, we have recently shown that TCI stimulates fibrinolysis in vitro and thus may have potential for applications to prevent or treat thrombotic disorders (17Arolas J.L. Lorenzo J. Rovira A. Castella J. Aviles F.X. Sommerhoff C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 3441-3448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). This 75-residue cysteine-rich protein constitutes a very interesting model of multidomain proteins, with two compact domains of similar size that display the same topology, but only share 27% of sequence identity (19Arolas J.L. Popowicz G.M. Lorenzo J. Sommerhoff C.P. Huber R. Aviles F.X. Holak T.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 350: 489-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Each domain consists of a short α-helix followed by a small twisted antiparallel β-sheet and is cross-linked by three disulfide bonds (Fig. 1). All six disulfide bonds seem to contribute to the high stability of the protein against temperature and denaturing agents. The crystal structures of TCI in complex with either bovine CPA or human CPB have revealed a double-headed binding mode not previously seen for the other CP inhibitors (20Rees D.C. Lipscomb W.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 160: 475-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 21Reverter D. Fernandez-Catalan C. Baumgartner R. Pfander R. Huber R. Bode W. Vendrell J. Holak T.A. Aviles F.X. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 322-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar): the C-terminal tail of TCI interacts with the active site of the enzyme in a way that mimics substrate binding, whereas the N-terminal domain binds to an exosite distinct from the active site groove. Only the folding of single-domain disulfide-rich proteins has been characterized in depth to date. Therefore, TCI represents an attractive model system for understanding the folding and unfolding of both, multidomain and disulfide-rich proteins. The present work describes a detailed study of the oxidative folding and reductive unfolding of TCI. Kinetic, thermodynamic, structural, and functional analyses of the two isolated domains, in comparison with the native protein, provide the biochemical basis for the two-domain nature of this inhibitor. Protein Expression and Purification—The synthetic gene cloned into the pBAT4-OmpA plasmid (17Arolas J.L. Lorenzo J. Rovira A. Castella J. Aviles F.X. Sommerhoff C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 3441-3448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) was used as template to generate by PCR the constructs corresponding to the two protein domains of TCI. The N- (residues 1-36) and C-terminal (residues 37-75) domain constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. Complete TCI, and the two domains were obtained by heterologous expression in Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) using M9 minimal medium containing 0.5% glycerol and 0.2% casamino acids and inducing with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (final concentration). The proteins were subsequently purified from the extracellular medium by three chromatographic steps. Briefly, first the protein was applied into a Sep-Pak C18 cartridge (Waters) activated with 100% acetonitrile. The bound protein was washed with water followed by 10% acetonitrile, eluted with 30% 2-propanol, and then concentrated in a Rotavapor to remove the organic solvent. This initial step of purification was followed by a cation-exchange chromatography in a Sep-Pack CM cartridge (Waters), applying a gradient of 1 m NaCl in MES buffer (50 mm, pH 5.5). A final step of reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) in a 4.6-mm Protein C4 column (Vydac), using a linear gradient from 10-40% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid for 30 min, was performed to achieve maximal purity (>98%). Protein identity was confirmed by mass spectrometry (MS). Oxidative Folding—Proteins (1 mg) were dissolved in Tris-HCl buffer (0.1 m, pH 8.4) containing 8 m guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl) and 100 mm dithiothreitol (DTT) and kept at 23 °C for 2 h. To initiate folding, the reduced and denatured sample was passed through a PD-10 column (Amersham Biosciences), previously equilibrated with Tris-HCl buffer (0.1 m, pH 7.4 or 8.4). The protein was then recovered in 1.2 ml and immediately diluted to a final protein concentration of 0.5 mg/ml in the same Tris-HCl buffer, both in the absence (Control-) and presence of redox agents: 0.25 mm 2-mercaptoethanol (Control +), 0.5 mm oxidized glutathione, or 0.5 mm/1 mm oxidized/reduced glutathione (GSSG/GSH). For some experiments, 4 μm protein disulfide isomerase (PDI, Sigma) or selected concentrations of denaturants (0.5-5 m GdnHCl or 1-8 m urea) were added to the reaction. Folding intermediates were trapped in a time-course manner by mixing aliquots of the sample with 2% trifluoroacetic acid and analyzed by RP-HPLC as follows. A linear 10-40% gradient of acetonitrile containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid was applied during 50 min into a 4.6-mm Jupiter C4 column (Phenomenex) at a flow rate of 0.75 ml/min. Alternatively, folding intermediates were trapped by derivatization with vinylpyridine (0.2 m) in Tris-HCl buffer (0.1 m, pH 8.4) at 23 °C for 45 min, further diluted in 10 volumes of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and analyzed by MS. Stop/Go Folding—Acid-trapped intermediates were isolated by RP-HPLC as described under “Oxidative Folding,” freeze-dried, and allowed to continue the folding (at 23 °C) by dissolving the sample (0.5 mg/ml) in Tris-HCl buffer (0.1 m, pH 8.4), both in the absence (Control-) and presence (Control +) of 0.25 mm 2-mercaptoethanol. Folding intermediates were then similarly trapped by acidification and analyzed by RP-HPLC. Denaturation and Reductive Unfolding—Native proteins were dissolved to a final concentration of 0.5 mg/ml in Tris-HCl buffer (0.1 m, pH 8.4) containing 0.25 mm 2-mercaptoethanol and selected concentrations of denaturants (0-8 m urea, 0-8 m GdnHCl, or 0-6 m guanidine thiocyanate (GdnSCN)). The reaction was allowed to reach equilibrium typically for 20 h at 23 °C. The samples were then quenched with 2% trifluoroacetic acid and analyzed by RP-HPLC using the conditions detailed under “Oxidative Folding.” For reductive unfolding experiments, native proteins (0.5 mg) were dissolved in 1 ml of Tris-HCl buffer (0.1 m, pH 8.4) with different concentrations of DTT (0.1-100 mm) at 23 °C. To monitor the kinetics of unfolding, time-course aliquots of the samples were likewise trapped with 2% trifluoroacetic acid and analyzed by RP-HPLC. Characterization of Peptide Ions Containing SH Groups and Disulfide Bonds—The acid-trapped intermediates were purified by RP-HPLC and freeze-dried. Each sample (20 μg) was alkylated with 50 μl of vinylpyridine (0.2 m) in Tris-HCl buffer (0.1 m, pH 8.4) at room temperature (23 °C) for 45 min. The derivatized sample was then freed from reagents using a C18 Zip-Tip pipette tip (Millipore) activated with 70% acetonitrile and equilibrated in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Following protein adsorption and washing with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, the proteins were eluted with 3 μl of 70% acetonitrile containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, dried, and treated with either trypsin or endoproteinase Lys-C (both sequencing grade, Roche Applied Science), at 1:20 (w/w) enzyme:substrate ratio, in Tris-HCl buffer (0.1 m, pH 8.4). Digestions were carried out at 37 °C for 15 h, and afterward the products were analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) MS in a Voyager-DE Pro (Applied Biosystems). For disulfide bond assignments, digestion mixtures of non-reduced polypeptides were dissolved in 5 μl of HEPES buffer (10 mm, pH 9.0), reduced by addition of DTT (100 mm), and incubated at 65 °C for 15 min. For mass fingerprinting analysis, the reduced digestion mixtures were then freed from reagents using a C18 Zip-Tip pipette tip as detailed above. 0.85 μl of the digests was spotted onto a MALDI-TOF sample holder, mixed with an equal volume of a saturated solution of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (Sigma) in 50% acetonitrile containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, dried, and analyzed with a MALDI-TOF MS operated in delayed extraction and reflector modes. The peptide mass fingerprint obtained was compared with the expected proteolytic digest of amino acids 23-97 (mature protein) of the UniProtKB/TrEMBL entry Q5EPH2_9ACAR (available at ca.expasy.org/uniprot) using the program PAWS (Proteometrics, available at prowl.rockefeller.edu/). All searches were constrained to a mass tolerance of 100 ppm. A tryptic peptide mixture of Cratylia floribunda seed lectin (SwissProt accession code P81517) prepared and previously characterized in our laboratory was used as mass calibration standard (mass range, 450-3300 Da) and used for mass fingerprinting. The sequence of selected peptides was determined by collision-induced dissociation by electrospray ionization tandem MS (MS/MS) using a QTrap instrument (Applied Biosystems) equipped with a nanoelectrospray source (Protana, Denmark). Double-charged ions selected after Enhanced Resolution MS analysis were fragmented using the Enhanced Product Ion with the Q0 trapping option at 250 amu/s across the entire mass range. For MS/MS experiments, Q1 was operated at unit resolution, the Q1-to-Q2 collision energy was set to 35 eV, the Q3 entry barrier was 8 V, the linear ion trap Q3 fill time was 250 ms, and the scan rate in Q3 was 1000 amu/s. Product ion spectra were interpreted manually or using the on-line form of the MASCOT program at www.matrixscience.com. Mass Spectrometry and NMR Spectroscopy—The molecular masses of the recombinant proteins and the vinylpyridine-derivatized intermediates were determined by MALDI-TOF MS using a Bruker Ultraflex. Samples were prepared by mixing equal volumes of the protein solution and matrix solution: either α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (Sigma) or sinapic acid (Bruker) in 30% acetonitrile with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. For one-dimensional and two-dimensional NMR experiments, lyophilized proteins were dissolved to a final concentration of 3 mg/ml in H2O/D2O (9:1 ratio, v/v) containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (pH 2.0). NMR spectra were acquired at different temperatures (25-90 °C) either on a Bruker ARX 400-MHz spectrometer or on a Bruker Avance 500-MHz spectrometer equipped with a CryoProbe. The collected spectra were processed and analyzed using the TopSpinv1.3 software packages from Bruker Biospin. one-dimensional and two-dimensional 1H spectra were recorded using solvent-suppression WATER-GATE techniques. The mixing times in TOCSY and NOESY experiments were set at 80 and 200 ms, respectively. CP Inhibitory Activity—The inhibitory activity of folding intermediates and TCI domains was assayed by measuring the inhibition of the hydrolysis of the chromogenic substrate N-(4-methoxyphenylazoformyl)-Phe-OH by CPA and N-(4-methoxyphenylazoformyl)-Arg-OH by CPB at 350 nm. The assay was performed dissolving the substrates (both from Bachem) at a concentration of 0.1 mm in Tris-HCl buffer (50 mm, pH 7.5) containing 100 mm NaCl. The enzyme concentration was kept constant at ∼2 nm, and increasing amounts of inhibitor were added. The equilibrium dissociation constants (Ki) for the complexes were determined at the pre-steady state as described for tight binding inhibitors (22Bieth J.G. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 248: 59-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Bovine CPA was purchased from Sigma, and human CPB was produced in the Pichia pastoris strain KM71 as published elsewhere in detail (23Reverter D. Ventura S. Villegas V. Vendrell J. Aviles F.X. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3535-3541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The protein concentration of TCI and its two domains was determined based on the A280 of the solution (calculated extinction coefficient of TCI: E0.1% = 0.97; C-terminal domain E0.1% = 1.45; and N-terminal domain E0.1% = 0.43). Oxidative Folding of TCI—Oxidative folding of reduced and denatured TCI was carried out in Tris-HCl buffer at pH 8.4 in the absence (Control -) or presence of different catalyst agents, namely, 2-mercaptoethanol (Control +), GSSG, or a mixture of GSSG and GSH. The intermediates that accumulate along the folding process were trapped by acidification in a time-course manner and subsequently analyzed by RP-HPLC. The chromatographic profiles of the refolding reactions are shown in Fig. 2. A high number of intermediates populate the early stages of TCI folding (up to 3 h), with similar RP-HPLC profiles regardless of the presence of 2-mercaptoethanol (see Control - and Control +). Importantly, two predominant fractions of intermediates, named IIIa and IIIb, accumulate significantly during these initial phases. The last stages of TCI folding are also characterized by a highly heterogeneous amount of intermediates; however, these intermediates accumulate to a lesser extent in the presence of a reducing agent (Control +). The addition of GSSG and GSSG/GSH strongly accelerates the formation of intermediates and the recovery of native protein. In contrast, and unlike in other model proteins like leech carboxypeptidase inhibitor (24Arolas J.L. Bronsoms S. Lorenzo J. Aviles F.X. Chang J.Y. Ventura S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 37261-37270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), the addition of selected concentrations of denaturant (0-2 m urea, 0-1 m GdnHCl) does not significantly affect the folding reaction through the destabilization of intermediates (data not shown). To evaluate the disulfide bond content of the folding intermediates, the reactions were trapped by alkylation with vinylpyridine at selected time points and further analyzed by MS. The results show a sequential formation of 1-, 2-, 3-, 4-, 5-, and 6-disulfide intermediates that lead to the native structure (Fig. 3). The folding of TCI cannot reach completion in the absence of catalysts, indicated by the fact that only ∼15% of the protein is recovered as native form after 48 h of reaction (Fig. 2, Control-). The rest of the protein remains trapped as a mixture of non-native 6-disulfide (scrambled) isomers that need the presence of redox agents to reshuffle their disulfide bonds and reach the native state. Thus, the conversion of these isomers to the native protein constitutes the major rate-limiting step of the folding process. The presence of catalysts not only promotes the recovery of native TCI (∼85% in Control + and GSH/GSSG) but also the accumulation of another species at the end of the folding reaction. This species, named Xa, is a 6-disulfide scrambled isomer, based on vinylpyridine derivatization coupled to MS analysis, and represents ∼10% of the total protein. IIIa and IIIb intermediates were separated from other species by treatment with vinylpyridine and RP-HPLC, which allowed us to determine that they contain three disulfide bonds. Their disulfide pairings were determined by digestion with trypsin and Lys-C, followed by mass fingerprint analysis and peptide sequencing (for details, see “Experimental Procedures”). These studies revealed that both species comprise three native disulfide bonds in one domain and no disulfide bonds in the other domain. IIIa: Cys3-Cys31, Cys10-Cys27, and Cys16-Cys32; IIIb: Cys40-Cys70, Cys47-Cys64, and Cys54-Cys71. The list of peptides used for disulfide assignments is given in Table 1 and the MS spectra in the supplemental materials.TABLE 1Assignment of peptide fragments from IIIa and IIIb intermediates Peptides were generated by incubation with vinylpyridine in non-reducing (A) and reducing (B) conditions and subsequent digestion with sequencing grade bovine trypsin and endoproteinase Lys-C. Fragments containing pyridylethyl (PE-) cysteines, sulfhydryl groups (SH), and disulfide bonds (S–S) were analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS. Fragment limits refer to the amino acid sequence numbering of the mature protein (UniProtKB/TrEMBL entry Q5EPH2_9ACAR).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Open table in a new tab Because it was unlikely that the pathway of TCI to its functional conformation within the cell was as inefficient as reported above, the influence of the protein folding catalyst PDI was also investigated at pH 7.4 to mimic physiological conditions. As shown in Fig. 4, the addition of PDI has a dramatic effect on the final recovery of native TCI: 70% versus 6% in the presence and absence of PDI, respectively (Control-). Remarkably, the presence of PDI combined with GSH/GSSG strongly prevents the accumulation of the Xa scrambled isomer. Oxidative Folding of TCI Domains—To dissect the contribution of each individual domain in the folding of TCI, the oxidative folding of both isolated domains (N- and C-terminal domains, abbreviated here as Nt and Ct, respectively) was performed in Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.4) in the absence (Control-) or presence of catalyst agents. For the two domains, the RP-HPLC analysis of the acid-trapped intermediates showed a lower accumulation of intermediates along the folding reaction, as compared with that of the complete TCI (Fig. 2). The folding of Nt and Ct TCI undergoes a sequential conversion of 1-, 2-, and 3-disulfide intermediates to reach the native form, based on vinylpyridine alkylation and MS analysis (data not shown). In the case of Nt TCI, at the beginning of the folding process (up to 3 h) the RP-HPLC profiles were similar both in Control - and Control + experiments. It is at the last stages of folding when 3-disulfide (scrambled) isomers accumulate strongly hindering the recovery of native protein (∼20% at 48 h in Control-). Similar to TCI, the addition of redox agents greatly facilitated the conversion to the native structure, allowing a recovery of >80% in the presence of GSSG/GSH. It is worth mentioning that another species (a scrambled isomer) significantly accumulated at the end of the folding reaction together with the native form of Nt TCI (Fig. 2). Ct TCI refolds rapidly through a limited number of disulfide intermediates. Nevertheless, the folding reaction cannot reach completion and only ∼10% of the protein attains the native conformation in the absence of redox agents (Control-). Like in the cases of TCI and Nt TCI, most of the protein remained trapped as scrambled isomers; therefore the addition of a reducing agent strongly favors the recovery of the native protein. Remarkably, under these redox conditions all Ct TCI reached the native state (Fig. 2, Control + and GSSG/GSH). The oxidative folding of Nt and Ct TCI correlates with the results obtained from the stop/go experiments of IIIa and IIIb intermediates. These two species were isolated and allowed to resume their folding in the absence (Control-) and presence (Control +) of 2-mercaptoethanol (Fig. 5). In both conditions, IIIa, containing the same disulfide bonds as Nt TCI, folds through a few intermediates that lead to the formation of the other domain. The presence of reducing agent accounts for an almost complete recovery of native protein by promoting reshuffling of scrambled isomers. IIIb, containing the same disulfide bonds as Ct TCI, displays a more heterogeneous population of intermediates along its folding reaction. A final accumulation of scrambled isomers, strongly prevented by the addition of 2-mercaptoethanol, was observed as in the case of IIIa. However, the recovery of native protein was limited by the formation of a stable scrambled intermediate, which is analog to that found in the oxidative folding of TCI and Nt TCI. Reductive Unfolding of TCI and TCI Domains—Reductive unfolding of native TCI was carried out in Tris-HCl buffer at pH 8.4 using increasing concentrations of DTT as reducing agent. The unfolding intermediates were quenched by acidification in a time-course manner and analyzed by RP-HPLC. Different fractions of intermediates were detected along the process (Fig. 6); among them, two fractions with an HPLC elution time equivalent to that of the IIIa and IIIb intermediates were found to accumulate strongly. Subsequent disulfide assignment of these two species confirmed that they are indeed identical to the predominant 3-disulfide intermediates of TCI oxidative folding (data not shown). Similar RP-HPLC profiles were observed when the unfolding reaction was performed in the presence of different concentrations of DTT (from 0.5 to 100 mm). Reductive unfolding of purified IIIa and IIIb intermediates was also carried out at pH 8.4 using various concentrations of DTT (in supplemental materials). In all conditions, the reduction of their three native disulfide bonds undergoes an apparent “all-or-none” mechanism in which only low amounts of partially reduced intermediates accumulate (25Chang J.Y.

We and others have used genetic and biochemical approaches to find proteins interacting with αGMR, and several proteins were identified with different functional implications (13Ebner K. Bandion A.

The α2GMR has a different cytoplasmic domain but generally exhibits similar properties to αGMR in the cooperation with βGMR (17Crosier K.E. Wong G.G. Mathey-Prevot B. Nathan D.G. Sieff C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7744-7748Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Unlike the αGMR, the α2GMR is not up-regulated in granulocyte/macrophage (G/M) lineages, and the α2GMR appears to be more relevant in undifferentiated hematopoietic progenitor cells (18Slater N.J.

The intracellular region of c-Kit has two kinase domains separated by a kinase insert (23Tanaka S. Yanagisawa N. Tojo H. Kim Y.J. Tsujimura T. Kitamura Y. Sawasaki T. Tachi C. Biochim. Biophys.

SCF binding to c-Kit induces receptor dimerization and auto-phosphorylation, leading to activation of downstream signaling pathways (25Linnekin D. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 31: 1053-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). In mice, c-Kit is encoded at the white spotting (W) locus, its ligand SCF is encoded at the steel (Sl) locus, and mutations at the W or the Sl locus lead to sterility, pigment cell deficiency, and macrocytic anemia (26Besmer P. Manova K. Duttlinger R. Huang E.J. Packer A. Gyssler C. Bachvarova R.F. Dev. Suppl. 1993; : 125-137PubMed Google Scholar). c-Kit and αGMR are well known markers of differentiation, especially in hematopoietic cells. Starting with a high level of c-Kit and negligible amount of αGMR, hematopoietic stem or progenitor cells down-regulate c-Kit and up-regulate αGMR when they enter into the G/M lineage (22Domen J.

The receptor subunits are generally deemed as passively regulated adaptor molecules, and a direct interaction between αGMR and c-Kit has not been reported. Using our preliminary computational method for predicting protein interactions, we identified c-Kit as a possible interacting protein for αGMR. Here we describe how the αGMR/c-Kit physical interaction regulates signal initiation of the receptors and how α2GMR is different from αGMR on modulating c-Kit signaling. Vectors for 293T Cell Expression—Cells (293T) were maintained in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% bovine calf serum, 1% sodium pyruvate, 1% l-glutamine, and antibiotics. Human αGMR (in pMX) and mouse c-Kit (in pcDM8) were subcloned into HindIII and NotI sites of pcDNA4/His-V5c (Invitrogen). The 5′ primer for human αGMR is GCCGCAAGCTTAGCACCATGCTTCTCCTGGTGACA. The 3′ primer for full-length αGMR is GATAGTTTAGCGGCCGCGGTAATTTCCTTCACGGT. Mouse c-Kit was subcloned using 3′ GATAGTTTAGCGGCCGCGGCATCTTCGTGCACGAG. The 5′ primer for full-length c-Kit is GCCGCAAGCTTACCGCGATGAGAGGCGCTCGCGGC, and the 5′ primer for 256 amino acids at C terminus of c-Kit (kit256) is GCCGCAAGCTTGCGATGGACATGAAGCCTGGC. Immunoprecipitation—The cDNAs encoding αGMR (pcDNA4/His-V5c, 5 μg) and c-Kit (in pcDNA4/His-V5c, 5 μg) were transfected into 293T cells by calcium phosphate precipitation (28Pear W.S. Nolan G.P. Scott M.L. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8392-8396Crossref PubMed Scopus (2301) Google Scholar). Antibodies M-14 and C-18 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) were used for immunoprecipitation of c-Kit and αGMR, respectively, in lysis buffer (modified phosphate-buffered saline with 135 mm K+, 5 mm Na+, and 1.0% Triton X-100, protease, and phosphatase inhibitor cocktails from Sigma). Protein A (Sigma) was used to capture the antibodies. αGMR and c-Kit were detected with anti-V5-HRP (Invitrogen). The αGMR and kit256 (C terminus part of c-Kit) interaction experiments used αGMR in the pMX vector and kit256 in the pcDNA4/His-V5c vector. αGMR was immunoprecipitated and detected with C-18 antibody. The kit256 protein was detected with anti-V5-HRP. Detection of Phosphorylated c-Kit—Cells (293T) were transfected with mouse c-Kit (0.7 μg in pcDM8 vector) alone or in combination with αGMR (4 μg in pMX vector) for 16 h. Cells were harvested and treated with 100 ng/ml mouse SCF (R&D Systems Inc., Minneapolis, MN) for 10 or 20 min at room temperature. The cells were then lysed in lysis buffer (0.1% Triton X-100), and c-Kit was immunoprecipitated with the M-14 antibody. Protein A was used for capturing the antibody. Phosphorylated c-Kit was detected with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody clone 4G10 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. Lake Placid, NY), and c-Kit was detected with the M-14 antibody. Retroviral Vector Expression of αGMR Isoforms and Mutants—TF-1 and K562 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). TF-1 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium with 2 mm l-glutamine adjusted to contain 1.5 g/liter sodium bicarbonate, 4.5 g/liter glucose, 10 mm HEPES, and 1.0 mm sodium pyruvate, 10% fetal bovine serum, and 10 ng/ml human SCF (29Kitamura T.

Plasmids encoding the αGMR isoforms and mutants 5 μg each), the gag-pol vector (3.5 μg), and the vector for vesicular stomatitis virus G protein (VSV-G) (1.5 μg) were transfected into 293T cells in a 10-cm plate using the calcium phosphate precipitation method for 24 h. Transfected 293T cells were switched to cytokine-free TF-1 cell medium for 24 h, and the medium containing retroviruses was stored at −80 °C after 5 min of 1500 rpm centrifugation. The stored retroviruses (1 ml) were mixed with TF-1 cells (1 ml) or K562 cells (1 ml) with 4 μg/ml polybrene (Sigma). Flow Cytometry Analysis of αGMR Expression—TF-1 cells or K562 cells were infected with retroviruses encoding the αGMR isoforms and mutants. For flow cytometry analysis, cells were suspended in pH 7.4 phosphate-buffered saline with 1% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum and 0.1% sodium azide (Sigma) containing FITC-conjugated anti-αGMR antibody S-20 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) for 30 min at 4 °C. Cells were then washed with the staining buffer and analyzed with FACScalibur (BD Biosciences). The results were analyzed with FlowJo software. aGMR Interacts with c-Kit—The short intracellular domain of αGMR is required for GM-CSF signaling, and the membrane-proximal proline-rich region is especially important (9Polotskaya A.

An 18-amino acid peptide of αGMR (KRFLRIQRLFPPVPQIKD) from this region (347-364) was used in the application of our computational protein interaction prediction method. 4J. Chen and J. M. Cárcamo, manuscript in preparation. A peptide from caprine c-Kit (731-747, YVVPTKAADKRRSARIG, in the kinase insert domain) was found to be a likely interaction partner with the αGMR peptide in reverse orientation (Fig. 1A). Since the sequences of human, mouse, and caprine c-Kit have a very high degree of similarity (Fig. 1B), we tested the interaction between human αGMR and mouse c-Kit in co-immunoprecipitation experiments. When co-expressed in 293T cells, human αGMR was co-immunoprecipitated with mouse c-Kit (Fig. 1C). We also made a construct with 256 amino acids (kit256) from the C terminus of mouse c-Kit that contains the putative αGMR-interacting domain and found that kit256 was co-immunoprecipitated with αGMR when co-expressed in 293T cells (Fig. 1D). Therefore the αGMR and c-Kit appeared to interact through their intracellular domains. aGMR Inhibits c-Kit Auto-phosphorylation Induced by SCF—The physical interaction between c-Kit and αGMR suggested cooperation or cross-inhibition between SCF/c-Kit and GM-CSF/αβGMR signaling. Binding of αGMR to c-Kit, most likely to the kinase insert domain, implied that αGMR could modulate c-Kit kinase activity, and therefore we investigated whether αGMR influenced c-Kit kinase activity in 293T cells expressing mouse c-Kit and human αGMR. Mouse SCF stimulated time- and dose-dependent phosphorylation of c-Kit in 293T cells transfected only with c-Kit as detected by anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (Fig. 2). When cells were co-transfected with αGMR and c-Kit, the phosphorylation of c-Kit induced by SCF was clearly inhibited (Fig. 2). This result suggested an inhibitory function of the αGMR/c-Kit interaction. SCF/c-Kit-maintained Cells Restrict αGMR Expression—We asked whether αGMR could inhibit c-Kit signaling in the human hematopoietic cell line TF-1 that responds to growth factors such as SCF, GM-CSF, interleukin-3, or erythropoietin (29Kitamura T. Tange T. Terasawa T. Chiba S. Kuwaki T. Miyagawa K. Piao Y.F. Miyazono K. Urabe A. Takaku F. J. Cell. Physiol. 1989; 140: 323-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar). SCF stimulation through human c-Kit maintains the viability and proliferation of TF-1 cells, providing a good model of human c-Kit signaling for testing the αGMR inhibitory activity. We generated retroviral expression vectors for αGMR, α2GMR (the αGMR isoform with a variant cytoplasmic tail), αGMR-375 (the common portion of αGMR and α2GMR with 25 amino acids deleted from αGMR C terminus), and αGMR-356 (44 amino acids deleted from αGMR C terminus) (Fig. 3A). The four αGMR-related proteins have an identical extracellular domain that can be detected by flow cytometry using the same FITC-conjugated anti-αGMR antibody, conveniently allowing comparison of expression levels. The retroviruses produced in 293T cells were tested in the erythroleukemia cell line K562 that proliferates without requirement for growth factor supplements (31Marks D.C. Davey M.W. Davey R.A.

The four αGMR-related proteins were expressed by retrovirus infection of K562 cells with variations in expression levels and infection percentages, possibly reflecting different amounts of retroviruses delivered (Fig. 3B). When a retroviral vector expresses an inhibitor for SCF/c-Kit signaling in TF-1 cells maintained by SCF, the viability and proliferation of the infected cells should be decreased when compared with cells expressing a non-inhibitory protein. The results showed that in TF-1 cells, αGMR-356 (the intracellular domain deletion mutant) and α2GMR were expressed at high levels, whereas αGMR expression level was low as measured by fluorescence intensity (Fig. 3C). αGMR-375 was expressed at an intermediate level (Fig. 3C), suggesting that the two domains sequentially deleted from the intracellular portion of αGMR are both involved in the interaction with c-Kit. We also normalized the percentages of the TF-1 cells expressing the four αGMR-related proteins to those of K562 cells (Fig. 3B), in which we used the same doses of retroviruses. The normalized percentages also supported that αGMR inhibited c-Kit and αGMR-375 partially inhibited c-Kit (Fig. 3C). Exogenous αGMR Expression in TF-1 Cells Inhibits Endogenous SCF/c-Kit Signaling—We further attempted to achieve the expression of αGMR and α2GMR in TF-1 cells and test whether exogenously expressed αGMR could inhibit endogenous c-Kit signaling. To allow expression of αGMR in TF-1 cells, another growth factor, GM-CSF, was included in addition to SCF, relieving the viability dependence on SCF/c-Kit signaling. We noticed under a microscope that the addition of GM-CSF to SCF caused a significant TF-1 cell size increase and that the bigger cells could be driven back to smaller size in culture with SCF alone, quantifiable in the flow cytometry forward scatter/side scatter (FSC/SSC) plot (Fig. 4A). If TF-1 cells express a protein inhibitor of SCF/c-Kit signaling, SCF should be unable to drive enlarged cells to smaller cells. Therefore we used the cell population ratio of the lower left quadrant (LL, smaller cells) to the lower right quadrant (LR, bigger cells) from the FSC/SSC plot of TF-1 cells treated first with GM-CSF and SCF and then with SCF alone to measure the SCF response. A bigger LL/LR ratio would indicate a higher response. We identified cells positive with αGMR, αGMR-375, αGMR-356, and α2GMR with an anti-αGMR antibody in flow cytometry (Fig. 4B) and analyzed their FSC/SSC plots (Fig. 4C). α2GMR- and αGMR-356-positive cells had an LL/LR ratio similar to non-infected cells (low fluorescence population) (Fig. 4, C and D), indicating that α2GMR and αGMR-356 did not inhibit SCF/c-Kit signaling. αGMR-375 partially inhibited SCF response, and αGMR had the strongest inhibition (Fig. 4, C and D). The results demonstrated that the expression of human αGMR but not α2GMR inhibited human c-Kit signaling and that the inhibition was dependent on the intracellular domain of αGMR. Our results supported that the membrane-proximal region of the αGMR intracellular domain (used in our protein-interaction prediction) was involved in the interaction with c-Kit. It appeared that the membrane-distal region of αGMR intracellular domain enhanced the interaction with c-Kit and that the membrane-distal cytoplasmic tail of α2GMR prevented the protein-protein interaction with c-Kit. Our present study defines a molecular interaction between the αGMR and c-Kit, which is quite unique in that it involves a receptor tyrosine kinase and a non-kinase receptor subunit. The c-Kit kinase insert domain is known to bind phosphatidyl-inositol 3-kinase (24Lev S. Givol D. Yarden Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 678-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), suggesting that it is a domain accessible for interaction with other proteins, and therefore it is understandable that the αGMR/c-Kit interaction utilizes their intracellular domains. Our findings suggest that the inhibition of c-Kit signaling by αGMR is a result of direct receptor-receptor modulation. Not only could we roughly confirm the predicted interaction domains, we also demonstrated that αGMR inhibited c-Kit auto-phosphorylation in 293T cells with protein overexpression. Auto-phosphorylation is an early step in c-Kit signaling pathways, indicating that the inhibition is at the receptor level. If the inhibition occurred indirectly, i.e. through a third party mediator, the would-be mediator also needs to reach overexpression level to overtake c-Kit. It is very unlikely that 293T cells would happen to have such a mediator at that high level induced by αGMR; therefore the αGMR and c-Kit interaction appears to be direct. Our data do not exclude the possibility that αGMR binding to c-Kit affects SCF binding. Direct receptor-receptor trans-modulations are probably not rare as there are other examples including the hepatocyte growth factor receptor Met inhibition of Fas signaling and the 67-kDa laminin receptor inhibition of GM-CSF receptor signaling (15Chen J. Carcamo J.M. Borquez-Ojeda O. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Golde D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 14000-14005Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 32Wang X. DeFrances M.C.

As a measurement for SCF-induced cellular responses, we utilized an observation that SCF-supplemented TF-1 cells were smaller than GM-CSF-supplemented cells. The reduction of TF-1 cell size with SCF/c-Kit signaling is consistent with previous reports that c-Kit signaling-deficient mice had severe macrocytic anemia, in which the average size of erythrocytes was larger than normal (21Chabot B. Stephenson D.A. Chapman V.M. Besmer P. Bernstein A. Nature. 1988; 335: 88-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (1109) Google Scholar, 26Besmer P. Manova K. Duttlinger R. Huang E.J. Packer A. Gyssler C. Bachvarova R.F. Dev. Suppl. 1993; : 125-137PubMed Google Scholar). The expressions of αGMR and α2GMR at the mRNA level were studied during CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cell differentiation, and it was found that the ratio of α2GMR to αGMR was about 30-60-fold higher in undifferentiated hematopoietic cells (c-Kit positive) than in cells of G/M lineages (c-Kit negative) (18Slater N.J. Yamaguchi M. Rothwell D.G. Baker P. Heyworth C.M. Chopra R. Br. J. Haematol. 2003; 122: 150-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). This implies that the biological function of the alternatively spliced α2 isoform is to transduce GM-CSF signal in the presence of c-Kit. Both αGMR and α2GMR can cooperate with βGMR to transduce GM-CSF signals, and thus, their differential effects on c-Kit signaling might be an important biological reason for the existence of the receptor isoforms. As an inhibitor for c-Kit signaling, αGMR would be expected to interfere with biological processes in which c-Kit is known to be important, such as erythropoiesis. It was found that expression of human αGMR, but not βGMR or interleukin-3 receptor α subunit, in avian primary erythroblasts actively inhibited their outgrowth and erythroid differentiation, in which erythropoietin receptor and c-Kit are involved (33Wessely O. Bauer A. Quang C.T. Deiner E.M. von Lindern M. Mellitzer G. Steinlein P. Ghysdael J. Beug H. Biol. Chem. 1999; 380: 187-202Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). αGMR in those erythroblasts appeared to have induced changes reflective of the anemic phenotype in c-Kit-deficient mice, substantiating that αGMR is a c-Kit inhibitor. Another finding indicated that the signaling of GM-CSF through α2GMR/βGMR leads to more erythroid differentiation and less G/M differentiation than through αGMR/βGMR in FDCP-Mix cells (18Slater N.J. Yamaguchi M. Rothwell D.G. Baker P. Heyworth C.M. Chopra R. Br. J. Haematol. 2003; 122: 150-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Our theory could potentially account for the observed differences in that α2GMR allows c-Kit signaling and permits both erythroid and G/M differentiations, whereas αGMR inhibits c-Kit signaling and permits predominantly G/M differentiation. Using αGMR in the G/M lineage and c-Kit in the erythroid lineage, hematopoietic cells could ensure lineage divisions because the αGMR and c-Kit signaling pathways are intrinsically non-coexistent. The regulation of hematopoiesis has been extensively studied, and there are other known hematopoietic lineage regulators such as transcription factors PU.1 and CCAAT/enhancer binding protein α (C/EBPα) (34Scott E.W. Simon M.C. Anastasi J. Singh H. Science. 1994; 265: 1573-1577Crossref PubMed Scopus (1279) Google Scholar, 35Zhang D.E. Zhang P. Wang N.D. Hetherington C.J. Darlington G.J. Tenen D.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 569-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar). αGMR and c-Kit are quite special because these receptors were not previously known to coordinate their own signaling patterns. We attempted to use the retroviral vectors to express αGMR and its variants in purified human bone marrow CD34+ cells and investigate whether αGMR could influence lineage differentiation in colony formation assays. The CD34+ cells supplemented with SCF, GM-CSF, interleukin-3, and erythropoietin could express α2GMR, αGMR-375, and αGMR-356 but not αGMR in 24 h, similar to SCF-supplemented TF-1 cells (data not shown). The incompatibility of αGMR expression in CD34+ cells probably reflects the importance of c-Kit signaling for the maintenance of CD34+ cells (22Domen J. Weissman I.L. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 1707-1718Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). The suppression of αGMR expression in c-Kit signaling-dependent cells suggested that some differentiation markers can be naturally incompatible in hematopoietic stem cells, providing the stem cells a possible maintenance mechanism. Although the αGMR-expressing G/M lineage cells come from the c-Kit-expressing hematopoietic stem or progenitor cells, intermediate cells with both c-Kit and αGMR are rare (27de Jong M.O. Westerman Y. Wagemaker G. Wognum A.W. Stem Cells (Durham). 1997; 15: 275-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), suggesting that the intermediate cells only exist for a short duration during differentiation. Therefore a natural cell system with both αGMR and c-Kit was mechanistically not readily available for us to demonstrate the endogenous αGMR/c-Kit association. Nevertheless, it can be inferred from our results that overexpression of αGMR is not required for inhibiting endogenous c-Kit signaling since SCF-supplemented TF-1 cells could only allow very little αGMR expression, suggesting that the amount of αGMR needed for inhibiting TF-1 endogenous c-Kit signaling is very low. In summary, our studies showed that the αGMR could interact with c-Kit and inhibit c-Kit signaling, but α2GMR could not inhibit c-Kit signaling. The receptors αGMR and c-Kit are more than regulated adaptor molecules for transducing cytokine signals; rather, they are signal regulators in their own right.

Although forced expression of MBP-1 displays several intriguing properties, the function of endogenous MBP-1 has not yet been defined.Progression of the cell cycle in eukaryotic cells is controlled by a series of protein complexes composed of cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) 2The abbreviations used are: CDK, cyclin-dependent kinase; shRNA, short hairpin RNA; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorter; siRNA, small interfering RNA. 2The abbreviations used are: CDK, cyclin-dependent kinase; shRNA, short hairpin RNA; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorter; siRNA, small interfering RNA. (9Murray A.W. Cell. 2004; 116: 221-234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar). Cyclins are central regulators of the cell division cycle. D-type cyclins interact with CDK4 and CDK6 to drive the progression through early/mid-G1 in response to mitogen stimulation. Cyclin E·CDK2 is active in mid-G1 close to the restriction point and cyclin A·CDK2 from the beginning of S to M, whereas cyclin B·CDC2 is active at the G2/M transition. RNA interference has emerged as a powerful tool to precisely define mammalian gene function. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) is a double-stranded form of RNA containing 21–23 bp and can silence endogenous genes in a sequence-specific manner and reduce the production of specific proteins (10Elbashir S.M. Lendeckel W. Tuschl T. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 188-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (2678) Google Scholar, 11McManus M.T. Sharp P.A. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2002; 3: 737-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (1207) Google Scholar). In this study, we have used MBP-1-targeted siRNA to inhibit the expression of endogenous MBP-1 in androgen-independent human prostate cancer cells and determined its effect on prostate cancer cell growth. We have observed that depletion of MBP-1 in human prostate cancer cells resulted in inhibition of cyclin A and cyclin B1 expression and delayed cell cycle progression.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture—Androgen-independent human prostate cancer cells (PC3) and human embryonic kidney cells (293) were procured from ATCC and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen).Construction of MBP-1-specific siRNA in Plasmid Vector—We have identified two potent siRNA sequences targeted to MBP-1 mRNA (6Ghosh A.K. Steele R. Ray R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 14325-14330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Here, we have cloned small hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) targeting MBP-1 mRNA containing the sense target sequences (MBPsi-3, 5′-GAAGTATGACCTGGACTTC-3′; and MBPsi-4, 5′-GGAGACTGAAGATACCTTC-3′) followed by a 9-nucleotide hairpin loop, complementary target sequence, and a poly(A) termination signal in pRNAH1.1/neo plasmid vector (Genscript) under the control of the H1 promoter. The resulting constructs pRNAH1.1-MBPsi-3 and pRNAH1.1-MBPsi-4 were used to transfect mammalian cells. Control scrambled oligonucleotide were used similarly.Transfection of Cells—293 cells were cotransfected with cyto-megalovirus FLAG-MBP-1 and pRNAH1.1-MBPsi-3 or pRNAH1.1-MBPsi-4 using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) for validation of the efficiency of MBP-1 targeted shRNA. For the generation of stable transfectants, PC3 cells were transfected with pRNAH1.1-MBPsi-4. After 48 h of transfection, cells were split and treated with 800 μg/ml G418 for selection of antibiotic-resistant colonies over a period of 3 weeks. Individual colonies (PC3-4.2, PC3-4.3, and PC3-4P) or pooled colonies (PC3-4HP) were picked up and examined for the expression of endogenous MBP-1. One clone (PC3-4.2) was identified and used for subsequent studies. For supplementation of MBP-1, PC3-4.2 cells were infected with replication-deficient recombinant adenovirus expressing MBP-1 (AdMBP-1) (5Ghosh A.K. Majumder M. Steele R. Liu T.J. Ray R.B. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 2775-2784Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) or control adenovirus (dl312). After 48 h of infection, cell lysates were analyzed for cyclins by Western blot analysis using specific antibodies.Cell Proliferation Assay—PC3 control and PC3-4.2, PC3-4.3, PC3-4P, and PC3-4HP experimental cells were seeded at a density of 1.0 × 105. Cell viability was determined by trypan blue exclusion at various time intervals. Doubling time was calculated using the formula, Nt = N0 x 2f/t, where Nt represents number of cells at time t, N0 represents initial number of cells, and f is the frequency of cell cycles per unit of time.FACS Analysis and Preparation of Cell Lysates—Cells were plated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and grown overnight. Cells were serum-starved (0.2%) for 48 h and stimulated by adding complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. After 24 h, cells were trypsinized and fixed in ice-cold 70% ethanol overnight at 4 °C. Cells were washed, stained with propidium iodide for 2 h, and subjected to FACS analysis on a FACScan flow cytometer (BD Pharmingen). Data were analyzed using the CellQuest and ModFit software. For the analysis of cell cycle regulatory cyclins, cells were lysed in 2× SDS-sample buffer following serum stimulation at 0, 6, 12, 18, 24, and 36 h. Cell lysates were then subjected to Western blot analyses using specific antibodies. Antibodies to cyclins D1, E, A, and B1 were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology.Immunofluorescence—Cells were seeded in a dual-chamber slide (Nunc) at equal density. After 24 h, cells were fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde solution and permeabilized in 0.2% Triton X-100. The cells were then immunostained with a mouse monoclonal antibody to α-tubulin (Amersham Biosciences), followed by secondary antibody conjugated with Alexa 568 (Molecular Probes). The cells were counterstained with TO-PRO-3 iodide (Molecular Probes) and subjected to confocal microscopy (Bio-Rad 1024) to visualize emitted fluorescence.RESULTSInhibition of MBP-1 by RNA Interference—We have identified two potent siRNAs to transiently knock down endogenous MBP-1 in prostate cancer cells (6Ghosh A.K. Steele R. Ray R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 14325-14330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and cloned these shRNAs targeted to MBP-1 mRNA into a plasmid vector under the control of the H1 promoter (MBPsi-3 and MBPsi-4). To test the ability of these clones to inhibit MBP-1 expression, we cotransfected 293 cells with cytomegalovirus FLAG-MBP-1 and the MBP-1-specific siRNA plasmid DNA. After 48 h of transfection, cells were analyzed for expression of exogenous MBP-1 by Western blot using an antibody to FLAG epitope. Cells transfected with MBPsi-4 displayed >90% inhibition of MBP-1 expression (data not shown). Scrambled cloned shRNA was used as a negative control in parallel. For the generation of a stable cell line, PC3 cells were transfected with pRNAH1.1-MBPsi-4 and treated with G418 for selection of antibiotic-resistant colonies. Antibiotic-resistant colonies were expanded for analysis of MBP-1 expression. A differential expression of MBP-1 was observed at both mRNA and protein levels (Fig. 1). mRNA expression level of MBP-1 was analyzed by semiquantitative reverse transcription-PCR using specific primers, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was used as an internal control. We observed 94% (PC3-4.2), 92% (PC3-4.3), and 78% (PC3-4P) inhibition of MBP-1 mRNA as compared with that of the control PC3 mock clone (Fig. 1A). Cell lysates from these clones were analyzed for the detection of endogenous MBP-1 by Western blot using a specific monoclonal antibody. Similar results were observed at the protein level (Fig. 1B). Densitometric scanning suggested a 96% (PC3-4.2), 90% (PC3-4.3), and 65% (PC3-4P) inhibition of MBP-1 protein expression in comparison with the control PC3 mock clone. PC3-4.2 cells displayed the strongest knockdown of MBP-1 expression and were used for subsequent studies.Depletion of MBP-1 Results in Decreased Cell Proliferation—We next examined whether depletion of MBP-1 had an effect on cell proliferation. An equal number of control PC3 and MBP-1-depleted PC3 clones (PC3-4.2, PC3-4.3, PC3-4P, and PC3-4HP) were plated, and cell viability was counted every 48 h by trypan blue exclusion (Fig. 1C). MBP-1-targeted siRNA stably expressing PC3 clones exhibited a significantly slower rate of proliferation as compared with the control cells suggesting that depletion of MBP-1 inhibited cell proliferation. Interestingly, one clonal cell line (PC3-4P) displayed ∼65% MBP-1 inhibition and moderate inhibition of cell growth. The doubling time of PC3 control cells was ∼30 h, whereas the PC3-4.2 or PC3-4HP cells exhibited a doubling time of ∼57 h. Based on this observation, we primarily focused our study on control PC3 cells and PC3-4.2 clone.Next, we examined whether MBP-1 depletion modulated cell cycle progression in PC3-4.2 cells by FACS analysis. PC3 or PC3-4.2 cells were synchronized by serum starvation for 48 h. Cells were then stimulated with serum and stained with propidium iodide followed by FACS analysis. A significant increase in G2/M peak (27%) was observed in PC3-4.2 cells, compared with only a 10% increase in the control cells (Fig. 2), suggesting an accumulation at the G2/M phase of cell cycle. Therefore, these results suggested that depletion of MBP-1 in PC3 cells affected their normal regulation of cell cycle progression.FIGURE 2Depletion of MBP-1 resulted in accumulation of cells at the G2/M phase. PC3 and PC3-4.2 cells were synchronized, and 24 h after serum stimulation, cells were stained with propidium iodide. DNA content was analyzed by flow cytometry. Results are represented as percent of cell population in G1, S, and G2/M phases of the cell cycle.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Depletion of MBP-1 Is Associated with Inhibition of Cyclins A and Cyclin B1—To unravel the mechanism of cell growth inhibition induced by MBP-1 depletion, we examined the expression of cyclins specific for G1, S, and G2/M phases of the cell cycle. For this, PC3 control and PC3-4.2 cells were serum-starved, and cell lysates were prepared at 0, 6, 12, 18, 24, and 36 h following serum stimulation. Cell lysates were analyzed for cyclin D1, cyclin E, cyclin A, and cyclin B1 by Western blot using specific antibodies (Fig. 3). Our results indicated no significant alteration in the expression levels of cyclin D1 in PC3-4.2 cells as compared with the PC3 control cells (Fig. 3A). Induction of cyclin E in PC3 cells was observed after serum stimulation (Fig. 3B). The expression level of cyclin E in PC3 cells peaked at 12 h and gradually decreased at 18 h. On the other hand, the cyclin E expression level in PC3-4.2 cells was induced and remained similar between 6 and 18 h suggesting a long S phase. A significantly lower expression level of cyclin A and cyclin B1 was observed in PC3-4.2 cells as compared with that in the control PC3 cells at 0 h of serum stimulation (Fig. 3, C and D). Induction of cyclin A and cyclin B1 expression in control cells was observed as early as 12–18 h following serum stimulation, which was detected in PC3-4.2 cells after 24 h, albeit at a much lower level. Densitometric analysis after normalization of the protein load demonstrated an ∼7-fold reduction of the cyclin A expression at the basal level in the PC3-4.2 cells as compared with the mock-transfected control PC3 cells. Similarly, an ∼12-fold decrease in the basal expression level of the cyclin B1 was observed in PC3-4.2 cells when compared with that of PC3 cells. Together, these results suggested that depletion of MBP-1 results in reduced expression of cyclin A and cyclin B1 in PC3-4.2 cells, which may delay the progression and exit from the S-G2/M phases of the cell cycle. We have also examined the status of cyclin B1 in other PC3 clones after synchronization by serum starvation. A significant reduction of cyclin B1 was observed in PC3-4.3 and PC3-4P clones, as well as in a pooled PC3-4HP cell line (Fig. 4). This result suggested that the observed effect in PC3-4.2 cells was not because of clonal variation, and depletion of MBP-1 in PC3 cells indeed resulted in an inhibition of cyclin B1 expression and cell proliferation.FIGURE 3Cyclin A and cyclin B1 expression is inhibited upon MBP-1 depletion in prostate cancer cells. PC3 and PC3-4.2 cells were synchronized, and cell lysates were prepared at indicated time intervals following serum stimulation. The cell lysates were analyzed for the expression of cyclins of different phases of the cell cycle by Western blot using specific antibodies to cyclin D1 (A), cyclin E (B), cyclin A (C), and cyclin B1 (D). The blots were reprobed with an antibody to β-tubulin for comparison of protein levels. Expression level of the cyclins was quantified by densitometric analyses and presented by bar diagram after normalization of the protein load relative to the β-tubulin expression. The x-axis represents the number of hours following serum stimulation, and y-axis represents the expression levels of the specific cyclin.

After 48 h of transduction, cell lysates were analyzed for the expression of cyclin A and cyclin B1 by Western blot using specific antibodies. A dose-dependent increase in cyclin A and cyclin B1 expression level was observed in PC3-4.2 cells supplemented with exogenous MBP-1 as compared with that in PC3-4.2 cells (Fig. 5). Thus, these results confirm that MBP-1 expression is associated with the regulation of cyclin A and cyclin B1 expression in PC3 cells.FIGURE 5Supplementation of MBP-1 restores expression of the cyclin A and cyclin B1. PC3-4.2 cells were supplemented with MBP-1 by transduction with different doses of AdMBP-1 or control dl312 adenovirus. After 48 h of transduction, cell lysates were analyzed by Western blot for the expression of MBP-1, cyclin A, and cyclin B1 using specific antibodies. The blots were reprobed with an antibody to β-tubulin for comparison of protein load.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Depletion of MBP-1 Increases Cell Size—We observed that PC3-4.2 cells grow at a much slower rate than the control PC3 cells, and when PC3-4.2 cells reached confluency, the total number of cells counted was at least two times lower than that of control cells. This prompted us to examine whether morphology or size was altered following depletion of MBP-1 in PC3 cells. We determined the cell morphology by immunostaining with an antibody to α-tubulin followed by nuclear staining with TO-PRO-3 iodide and then performed confocal microscopy. Our results suggested that the control PC3 cells exhibited a population of homogeneous cell size (Fig. 6A). Interestingly, a larger size of PC3-4.2 cell population was observed under the same magnification and similar experimental conditions (Fig. 6B). However, both cell lines exhibited an intact tubule network (red staining). This result suggests that MBP-1 depletion caused the cells to grow to a larger size without affecting the architecture of the cells.FIGURE 6MBP-1 depletion results in increased cell size. PC3 (A) and PC3-4.2 (B) cells grown at confluency were fixed with formaldehyde solution. Cells were immunostained with an antibody to α-tubulin followed by labeling with an Alexa 568-conjugated secondary antibody. The cells were then counter-stained with a nuclear staining dye, TO-PRO-3 iodide. Emitted fluorescence was observed under a confocal microscope (same magnification for both panels, ×600).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)DISCUSSIONIn this study, we examined the function of endogenous MBP-1 in prostate cancer cell growth regulation. For this, we depleted the expression of MBP-1 in PC3 cells using RNA interference and observed delayed cell proliferation. Our previous reports demonstrated that forced expression of MBP-1 suppresses cancer cell growth (5Ghosh A.K. Majumder M. Steele R. Liu T.J. Ray R.B. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 2775-2784Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 7Ray R.B. Steele R. Seftor E. Hendrix M. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 3747-3751PubMed Google Scholar, 8Ghosh A.K. Steele R. Ray R.B. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 718-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). It was therefore surprising to find that depletion of MBP-1 reduced PC3 cell growth. Depletion of endogenous MBP-1 in PC3 cells (PC3-4.2) exhibited a longer doubling time (30 versus 57 h) and accumulated at the G2/M phase (2.7-fold higher as compared with the control PC3 cells), suggesting an inhibition or delay to exit from the G2/M phase. We have observed that a threshold level expression of MBP-1 is necessary for normal proliferation of PC3 cells. As shown in Fig. 1, cell proliferation is related with the level of MBP-1 expression. We examined the expression of different cyclins in PC3-4.2 cells. Cyclin D1 expression was similar between control PC3 and PC3-4.2 cells. Cyclin E expression peaked at 12 h in control PC3 cells after serum stimulation however, in PC3-4.2 cells, cyclin E expression remained unaltered from 6–18 h after serum stimulation suggesting an extended S phase. Subsequent studies demonstrated a significant reduction of cyclin A and cyclin B1 expression at the basal level in PC3-4.2 cells. Although PC3-4.2 cells exhibited a delayed induction of cyclin A and cyclin B1 expression in response to serum stimulation, the level of expression of the cyclins could not attain the same levels when compared with the control cells.Cells must have properly regulated DNA damage checkpoints to maintain the integrity of the genome. Entry into mitosis is perhaps the most critical juncture for maintaining genetic integrity in eukaryotic cells. The proper regulation of cyclin B1, the regulatory subunit of Ser/Thr kinase CDC2 (CDK1), and the cyclin B1·CDC2 complex are essential for the entry into mitosis (12Machida Y.J. Dutta A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 6253-6256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Cyclin B1 is involved in checkpoint control, and its deregulated expression can contribute to the chromosomal instability observed in human cancer (12Machida Y.J. Dutta A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 6253-6256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 13Jin P. Hardy S. Morgan D.O. J.

Flaman J.M. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 2051-2057Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). On the other hand, cyclin A·CDK2 complex has been shown as a key regulator of CDC2 activation in human cells through effects on CDC25B and CDC25C activity (18Mitra J. Enders G.H. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 3361-3367Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Cyclin A is the major activating subunit of CDK2 during S and G2 phases. Therefore, a lower level of expression of both cyclin A and cyclin B1 may reduce the kinase activities of cyclin A·CDK2 and cyclin B1·CDC2 complexes in PC3-4.2 cells, thereby delaying G2/M exit phase. Reduction in cyclin A and cyclin B1 expression at the basal levels by the depletion of endogenous MBP-1 in PC3-4.2 cells suggests that MBP-1 may take an active part in cell cycle regulation. Exogenous supplementation of MBP-1 in PC3-4.2 cells significantly enhanced the endogenous levels of the cyclin A and cyclin B1, further suggesting that MBP-1 modulated cell cycle progression by regulating the expression of cyclin A and cyclin B1. Whether MBP-1-mediated regulation of cyclin A and cyclin B1 is direct or through other transcription factors remains unknown at this time. Further studies are needed to unravel MBP-1-mediated regulation of the cyclins.We have observed that depletion of MBP-1 resulted in a larger size of MBP-1-depleted PC3 cells as compared with the control PC3 cells without altering the microtubular network. Cell proliferation is a coordinated process, whereby cells duplicate their contents and increase their mass and size (cell growth) before initiating cell division. Constitutive expression ofac-myc transgene results in an increase in cell size of normal pretransformed B-lymphocytes at all stages of B cell development without affecting cell cycle progression (19Iritani B.M. Eisenman R.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13180-13185Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). In the liver, hepatocytes can augment cell size by increasing cell ploidy through an altered cell cycle without cytokinesis (20Gupta S. Semin. Cancer Biol. 2000; 10: 161-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). It could be possible that lower expression of the cyclin A and cyclin B1 does not allow the cells to divide initially, rather leaving the cells at an increased size.In summary, a correlation between MBP-1 expression and cell proliferation was observed in PC3 cells. MBP-1 plays an important part in the cell cycle by regulating the expression of cyclin A and cyclin B1, two essential components for proper regulation of the S-G2/M phases, and endogenous expression of MBP-1 is needed for proper execution of cell cycle progression and proliferation in prostate cancer cells. We therefore suggest the dual signal role for MBP-1. Dual function was observed in tumor suppressor von Hippel-Lindau. Recently, Mack et al. (21Mack F.A. Patel J.H. Biju M.P. Haase V.H. Simon M.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 4565-4678Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) have shown that von Hippel-Lindau protein loss can be detrimental to specific cell types through the induction of growth arrest. Opposing roles in cell growth were observed with several other genes such as KLF4, E2F, Ras, and TGF-β (22Rowland B.D. Peeper D.S. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2006; 6: 11-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). Profiling of proteins and identification of in vivo targets of MBP-1 upon overexpression and depletion will be needed to more precisely elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which MBP-1 regulates the prostate cancer cell growth. MBP-1, an ∼37-kDa cellular protein, is ubiquitously expressed in different human tissues and located at human chromosome 1p35-pter (1Ray R. Miller D.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2154-2161Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 2Ray R.B. Sheikh M.S. Fontana J.F. Miller D.M. Int. J. Oncol. 1994; 5: 1433-1436PubMed Google Scholar, 3White R.A. Adkison L.R. Dowler L.L. Ray R.B. Genomics. 1997; 39: 406-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). MBP-1 acts as a general transcriptional repressor (4Ghosh A.K. Steele R. Ray R.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2880-2886Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Structure/function analysis of MBP-1 mutants revealed that the transcriptional repressor domains were located in the amino-terminal and carboxyl-terminal regions. Ectopic expression of MBP-1 induces cell death in a number of cancer cells (5Ghosh A.K. Majumder M. Steele R. Liu T.J. Ray R.B. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 2775-2784Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 6Ghosh A.K. Steele R. Ray R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 14325-14330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and regresses human breast and prostate tumor growth in nude mice (7Ray R.B. Steele R. Seftor E.

Although forced expression of MBP-1 displays several intriguing properties, the function of endogenous MBP-1 has not yet been defined. Progression of the cell cycle in eukaryotic cells is controlled by a series of protein complexes composed of cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) 2The abbrev"
https://openalex.org/W2074468064,"Previous studies in Trypanosoma brucei have shown that intracellular pH homeostasis is affected by inhibitors of H+-ATPases, suggesting a major role for these pumps in this process (Vander-Heyden, N., Wong, J., and Docampo, R., (2000) Biochem. J. 346, 53-62). Here, we report the cloning and sequencing of three genes (TbHA1, TbHA2, and TbHA3) present in the genome of T. brucei that encode proteins with homology to fungal and plant P-type proton-pumping ATPases. Northern and Western blot analyses revealed that these genes are up-regulated in procyclic trypomastigotes. TbHA1, TbHA2, and TbHA3 complemented a Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain deficient in P-type H+-ATPase activity, providing genetic evidence for their function. Indirect immunofluorescence analysis showed that TbHA proteins are localized mainly in the plasma membrane of procyclic forms and in the plasma membrane and flagellum of bloodstream forms. T. brucei H+-ATPase genes were functionally characterized using double-stranded RNA interference methodology. The induction of double-stranded RNA (RNA interference) caused growth inhibition, which was more accentuated in procyclic forms and when expression of all TbHA proteins was decreased. Knockdown of TbHA1 and TbHA3, but not of TbHA2, resulted in cells with a lower steady-state pHi and a slower rate of pHi recovery from acidification. No evidence was found of an intracellular P-type H+-ATPase activity. These results establish that T. brucei H+-ATPases are plasma membrane enzymes essential for parasite viability. Previous studies in Trypanosoma brucei have shown that intracellular pH homeostasis is affected by inhibitors of H+-ATPases, suggesting a major role for these pumps in this process (Vander-Heyden, N., Wong, J., and Docampo, R., (2000) Biochem. J. 346, 53-62).

No evidence was found of an intracellular P-type H+-ATPase activity. These results establish that T. brucei H+-ATPases are plasma membrane enzymes essential for parasite viability. Sleeping sickness, also known as human African trypanosomiasis, is caused by protozoan parasites within the Trypanosoma brucei complex. These parasites have a digenetic life cycle with two main stages: the bloodstream form, which lives in the bloodstream of its mammalian host, and the procyclic form, which lives in the insect vector. The procyclic form replicates within the alimentary tract of the tsetse fly, where the environmental (extracellular) pH is acidic (1Wigglesworth V.B. Parasitology. 1929; 21: 288-321Crossref Scopus (92) Google Scholar), whereas the bloodstream form propagates in the host's blood, where the extracellular pH is consistently 7.4. Marked differences in metabolism and in intracellular pH (pHi) regulation between the two stages have evolved as a result of the very different environments in which they reside (2VanderHeyden N. Wong J. Docampo R. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 53-62Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The ability of T. brucei to regulate its pHi throughout its life cycle is critical to its survival, as most intracellular enzymes function optimally within a narrow pH range. In most higher eukaryotic cells whose environment is neutral, metabolically generated protons are exchanged for Na+ via an Na+/H+ antiporter (3Barnard J.P. Pedersen P.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 313: 77-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The sodium gradient generated by the Na+/K+-ATPase drives this exchange. However, at low extracellular pH, Na+/H+ exchange is unfavorable, and cells that maintain a pHi that is more alkaline than their environment therefore frequently utilize ATP-driven proton pumps to regulate their pHi. Proton pumping is electrogenic and is usually supported by one or more anion or cation conductive pathways that serve to partially dissipate the membrane potential, thereby increasing the efficiency of the pump. In addition, the protonmotive force generated by these pumps frequently drives nutrient uptake in these cells (2VanderHeyden N. Wong J. Docampo R. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 53-62Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). On the basis of studies performed with inhibitors of proton pumps, it has been suggested that, although a plasma membrane H+-ATPase is a major regulator of pHi (2VanderHeyden N. Wong J. Docampo R. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 53-62Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and membrane potential (ΔΨ) (4VanderHeyden N. Docampo R. J. Eukaryot. Microbiol. 2002; 49: 407-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) in procyclic forms, it plays a minor role in blood-stream forms, where pyruvate efflux is more important for pHi regulation, and an ouabain-sensitive sodium pump is more relevant for ΔΨ regulation. In this regard, bloodstream forms live in the neutral pH, constant ion environment of the mammalian bloodstream, where the need to maintain ΔΨ could be satisfied by an Na+/K+-ATPase that causes K+ uptake and Na+ efflux. Because the ion concentrations in blood are held constant, the plasma membrane of bloodstream forms of T. brucei, like that of most mammalian cells, can be relatively permeable to cations (2VanderHeyden N. Wong J. Docampo R. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 53-62Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, in a neutral pH environment, a passive rather than an active mechanism of regulation of pHi is likely to dominate, lessening the need for a plasma membrane H+-ATPase (2VanderHeyden N. Wong J. Docampo R. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 53-62Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4VanderHeyden N. Docampo R. J. Eukaryot. Microbiol. 2002; 49: 407-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Similarly, a Na+/K+-ATPase appears to play an important role in regulating the membrane potential of Trypanosoma cruzi bloodstream forms, which are also more permeable to cations than are the other life stage forms (5Vanderheyden N. Docampo R. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2002; 120: 127-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). As with yeast (6Serrano R. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1989; 40: 61-94Crossref Google Scholar), the lack of inhibitors specific enough for in vivo experiments makes it necessary to perform molecular studies of the T. brucei plasma membrane H+-ATPases to elucidate their importance. H+-ATPases within the P-type ATPase family are proton pumps driven by the hydrolysis of ATP. These pumps were found initially only in the plasma membrane of plants and fungi (7Palmgren M.G. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 2001; 52: 817-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar). A sequence analysis of conserved core sequences of all P-type ATPases has grouped them into five subfamilies designated types I-V (8Axelsen K.B. Palmgren M.G. J. Mol. Evol. 1998; 46: 84-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (735) Google Scholar). Type III covers H+-ATPases (type IIIA) and a small group of Mg2+-ATPases from bacteria (type IIIB). All fungal P-type H+-ATPases compose one subcluster within type IIIA; the plant enzymes compose a second subcluster; and sequences found in Leishmania donovani made up a third subcluster (8Axelsen K.B. Palmgren M.G. J. Mol. Evol. 1998; 46: 84-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (735) Google Scholar). In previous work, we reported that the sequences of T. cruzi P-type H+-ATPase-1 and -2 (TcHA1 and TcHA2, respectively) belong to the same subcluster as the L. donovani sequences and provided genetic and biochemical evidence of the role of their protein products in H+ transport (9Luo S. Scott D.A. Docampo R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44497-44506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The presence of several genes encoding H+-ATPases is frequent in plants as well as in microorganisms, where several isoforms with distinct catalytic or regulatory properties may coexist in the same cell (10Møller J.V. Juul B. le Maire M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1286: 1-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar, 11Morsomme P. Boutry M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1465: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). For example, the PMA2 gene product in yeast shows 89% identity to the PMA1 gene product (12Schlesser A. Ulaszewski S. Ghislain M. Goffeau A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 19480-19487Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), although PMA2 is expressed at very low levels and is not essential for growth (13Supply P. Wach A. Goffeau A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19753-19759Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The absence of P-type H+-ATPases in mammalian cells (8Axelsen K.B. Palmgren M.G. J. Mol. Evol. 1998; 46: 84-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (735) Google Scholar, 10Møller J.V. Juul B. le Maire M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1286: 1-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar) and their presence in fungi has led to the proposal that these pumps are promising targets for antifungal therapy (14Monk B.C. Perlin D.S. Crit. Rev. Microbiol. 1994; 20: 209-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), and a similar proposal could be made regarding trypanosomatids (15Vieira M. Rohloff P. Luo S. Cunha-e-Silva N. de Souza W. Docampo R. Biochem. J. 2005; 392: 467-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In this regard, only electroneutral P-type H+/K+-ATPases belonging to the same family as the Na+/K+-ATPases are present in the plasma membrane of some mammalian cells (16Jaisser F. Beggah A.T. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: F812-F824Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, we report the cloning and sequencing of three T. brucei genes that encode proteins with homology to the T. cruzi and L. donovani P-type H+-ATPases. T. brucei H+-ATPases are more abundant in procyclic than in bloodstream stages. The function of these ATPases was studied using RNA interference (RNAi) 3The abbreviations used are: RNAi, RNA interference; DPBS, Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline; contigs, groups of overlapping clones; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; Mops, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid.3The abbreviations used are: RNAi, RNA interference; DPBS, Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline; contigs, groups of overlapping clones; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; Mops, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid. and a yeast strain deficient in P-type H+-ATPase (RS-72). The subcellular localization of the H+-ATPases in T. brucei was also investigated. Culture Methods for T. brucei—The procyclic form 29-13 cell line and the bloodstream form BF cell line (114hyg5′-328, also known as the “single-marker” cell line), coexpressing T7 RNA polymerase and the tetracycline repressor were gifts from Dr. George A.

Procyclic forms were grown in SDM-79 (18Brun R. Jenni L. Schönenberger M. Schell K.F.

Blood-stream forms were grown in HMI-9 (19Hirumi H. Hirumi K. J.

Cell densities were determined using a Neubauer chamber. Procyclic forms were diluted to 1 × 106 cell/ml and bloodstream forms to 0.5 × 105 cell/ml and cultured in the appropriate media. Growth curves were plotted using the product of the cell density and the dilution factor.

The new strains (bearing the respective plasmids) were named MP625 (pMP625), RS1002 (pRS890), RD0511 (pRD051), RD0522 (pRD052), and RD0533 (pRD053). Transformants were maintained in SGAH medium or transferred to medium containing 2% (w/v) glucose (dextrose) in place of galactose (SDAH medium). The media were buffered with 50 mm succinic acid adjusted to pH 5.5. Solid media contained 2% agar (Difco).

Chem. 2002; 277: 44497-44506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) identified three contigs in the T. brucei genome data base in chromosome 10 (TRYP10.0.001893, 52,000 bp; contig 12146, 52,000 bp; TRYP10.0.001690, 4070 bp; available at www.sanger.ac.uk/Projects/T_brucei/) and a partial sequence called the protonmotive P-type ATPase TBH1 (GenBank™ accession number AF145721; 773 bp) in the NCBI Database (available at www.ncbi.nlm.nih.goventrez/viewer.fcgi?val=AF145721.1). Sequence analysis showed that the three contigs encode three putative P-type ATPases designated TbHA1, TbHA2, and TbHA3. Based on this information, a 1.2-kb cDNA fragment, which is identical in the central regions of TbHA1, TbHA2, and TbHA3, was cloned and sequenced using the reverse transcription-PCR technique with gene-specific primers TbP51 (5′-TCACGATCTGCGTTCACTGC-3′) and TbP31 (5′-TTGCCAAACCAAGAGTTGGG-3′). To obtain the full-length cDNA, the rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) technique (23Frohman M.A. Dush M.K. Martin G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8998-9002Crossref PubMed Scopus (4314) Google Scholar) was performed using a Marathon cDNA amplification kit and primer Tb-5′-SL (5′-AACGCTATTATTAGAACAGTTTCTG-3′) and specific primers TbP31, TbP32 (5′-CTGCAAGGCATCACGGAACT-3′), and TbP33 (5′-TGAGTATCGTCGCAGTTCTC-3′) for 5′-RACE and an oligo(dT) primer (5′-ATGGATGCCTACAGCGCTCTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT-3′) and specific primers TbP51, TbP52 (5′-GCTAAGTCGTCTAAGGAACC-3′), and TbP53 (5′-TGCTCACATGCTAATGGAGG-3′) for 3′-RACE. PCR products were cloned into the pCR2.1TA vector and sequenced using an ABI PRISM® BigDye™ Terminator Version 3.0 Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction kit. Sequence Analysis—DNA sequence data were generated at the High Throughput Sequencing and Genotyping Unit of the Keck Center for Comparative and Functional Genomics at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Sequence analysis was done using Biology WorkBench Version 3.2 (available at workbench.sdsc.edu) and Wisconsin Package Version 10.0-UNIX (Genetics Computer Group, Inc., Madison, WI). The PSORT program was from Kenta Nakai (University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan). The complete gene sequences for TbHA1, TbHA2, and TbHA3 were submitted to the GenBank™ Data Bank with accession numbers AF507072, AY115557, and AY263211, respectively. Southern and Northern Blot Analyses—DNA was isolated by standard procedures (24Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Total RNA was isolated with TRIzol reagent following the manufacturer's recommendations. The polyadenylated RNA was obtained using the PolyAtract® mRNA isolation system. DNA was run on 1.0% agarose gels with 40 mm Tris, 20 mm acetic acid, and 1 mm EDTA (pH 8.0) and transferred to Zeta-Probe GT nylon membranes. RNA was electrophoresed on 1.0% agarose gels with 2.2 m formaldehyde, 20 mm Mops (pH 7.0), 8 mm sodium acetate, and 1 mm EDTA and transferred to Zeta-Probe GT nylon membranes. DNA probes were prepared using random hexanucleotide primers, Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I (Prime-a-Gene® labeling system), and [α-32P]dCTP. The hybridized filters were washed under high stringency conditions (0.1% standard saline citrate and 0.1% SDS at 65 °C) unless indicated otherwise. The α-tubulin (TUB1) fragment, used as a control in Northern blot analyses, was obtained from pZJM (25Wang Z. Morris J.C. Drew M.E. Englund P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40174-40179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar), kindly provided by Dr. Paul T. Englund (Johns Hopkins University). Comparison of the levels of TbHA1 and TbHA2 transcripts in procyclic and bloodstream forms was done, taking as a reference the densitometric values obtained with the TUB1 transcripts and assuming a similar level of expression of this gene in both stages. SDS Electrophoresis and Preparation of Western Blots—Samples of total lysates from T. brucei procyclic and bloodstream stages (20 μg of protein in 10 μl) were mixed with 10 μl of 125 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7), 10% (w/v) mercaptoethanol, 20% (w/v) glycerol, 4.0% (w/v) SDS, and 4.0% (w/v) bromphenol blue as tracking dye and boiled for 5 min before application to 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Electrophoresed proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose with a Bio-Rad Trans-Blot apparatus. After transfer, the nitrocellulose was blocked overnight in 5% nonfat dry milk in 0.1% Tween 20/DPBS (Tween/DPBS) at 4 °C. A 1:10,000 dilution of polyclonal rabbit serum against TcHAf in Tween/DPBS was then applied at room temperature for 60 min. The nitrocellulose was washed three times for 15 min each with Tween/DPBS and incubated with secondary antibody (1:20,000) at room temperature for 60 min. Immunoblots were visualized on radiographic film using the ECL enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit (Amersham Biosciences) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Parasites fixed with 4% formaldehyde were allowed to adhere to poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips, permeabilized with 0.3% Triton X-100 for 5 min, blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin in DPBS, and incubated with a 1:100 dilution of anti-TcHAf antibody (9Luo S. Scott D.A. Docampo R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44497-44506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) and a 1:160 dilution of fluorescein isothiocyanate-coupled goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody. Control preparations were incubated with preimmune serum (1:100) or without the primary antibody. After being washed, slides containing the treated trypanosomes were mounted with anti-fade VECTASHIELD medium (Vector Laboratories). Immunofluorescence images were obtained with an Olympus BX-60 fluorescence microscope. The images were collected with a system consisting of a CCD camera (Model CH 250), an electronic unit (Model CE 200A, equipped with a 50-Hz 16-bit A/D converter), and a controller board (Model NU 200) (all from Photometrics Ltd., Tucson, AZ). Images were acquired and evaluated using Adobe Photoshop on a Macintosh Quadra 840AV computer. Deconvolution Fluorescence Microscopy—Fluorescence microscopy and digital image collection were performed on an Olympus IX-71 inverted fluorescence microscope with a Photometrics CoolSNAPHQ CCD camera driven by DeltaVision software (Applied Precision, Seattle, WA). Differential interference contrast and fluorescent optical images were taken through cells, and DeltaVision software (softWoRx) was used to deconvolve these images. Double-stranded RNA Expression and Trypanosome Transfection—DNA fragments corresponding to the N-terminal flanking and coding regions of TbHA1 and TbHA3 from nucleotides 43 to 294 and TbHA2 from nucleotides 62 to 349 were amplified by reverse transcription-PCR from T. brucei procyclic stage cDNA using primers P15 (5′-CTCGAGCATCTAAGGTAGTAAAGGC-3′) and P13 (5′-TCTAGAGAAGCTCGTTACGACCGTAT-3′) and primers P25 (5′-CTCGAGAGGCACCTTATAGGACACAG-3′) and P23 (5′-TCTAGATGAGTATCGTCGCAGTTCTC-3′ with the XhoI and XbaI linkers underlined), respectively. To inhibit the expression of TbHA1, TbHA2, and TbHA3 simultaneously, DNA fragments corresponding to the central coding regions of TbHA1, TbHA2, and TbHA3, which are identical, from nucleotides 1176 to 1880 of TbHA1 and TbHA3 and from nucleotides 1271 to 1976 of TbHA2 were amplified by reverse transcription-PCR from T. brucei procyclic stage cDNA using primers TbRNAiP5 (5′-GCTCGAGATGCACGATCTGCGTTCACTGCT-3′) and TbRNAiP3 (5′-TCTAGAGTCGTTCACACCATCACCAGC-3′, with the XhoI and XbaI linkers underlined). The PCR fragments were cloned into the pCR2.1TA vector and sequenced using the ABI PRISM® BigDye™ Terminator Version 3.0 Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction kit and ligated into the XhoI and XbaI sites of the RNAi vector p2T7 (26LaCount D. Barrett B. Donelson J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17580-17588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). For stable transfection of the procyclic form host strain 29-13, the protocol was performed as described by LaCount et al. (26LaCount D. Barrett B. Donelson J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17580-17588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Briefly, procyclic forms (1 × 107) were washed once with 5 ml of cytomix buffer (27Van den Hoff M.J. Moorman A.F. Lamers W.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 2902Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar) and resuspended in 0.5 ml of cytomix buffer containing 10 μg of plasmid that had been linearized by NotI digestion so that it could target the rDNA spacer region (28Wirtz E. Clayton C. Science. 1995; 268: 1179-1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Transfections were carried out in 4-mm cuvettes using a BTX electroporator with peak discharge at 1.5 kV and 25 microfarads. Immediately following transfection, parasites were transferred into 10 ml of SDM-79 supplemented with G418 and hygromycin. After 24 h, selection was applied by culturing in the presence of 2.5 μg/ml phleomycin, and the parasites were grown for 2 or 3 weeks to form stable lines. Clonal lines were obtained by limiting dilution. For induction of double-stranded RNA, parasites were cultured in the same medium containing 1.0 μg/ml tetracycline. Parasites were diluted 10-fold when densities reached a minimum of 1 × 106 cells/ml. They were not allowed to grow beyond 5 × 106 cells/ml before diluting again. In the case of the bloodstream host strain BF cell line, the protocol was as described by Morris et al. (29Morris J.C. Wang Z. Drew M.E. Paul K.S. Englund P.T. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2001; 117: 111-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Briefly, for each transfection, bloodstream forms of the parasites were grown to mid-log phase (5 × 105 cells/ml), and 2.5 × 107 cells were collected and washed once with 5 ml of cytomix buffer (27Van den Hoff M.J. Moorman A.F. Lamers W.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 2902Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar) and resuspended in 0.5 ml of cytomix buffer containing 10 μg of plasmid that had been linearized with NotI. Electroporations were carried out at room temperature in 4-mm cuvettes using a BTX electroporator (peak discharge at 1.5 kV and 25 microfarads). Immediately following transfection, parasites were transferred into 24 ml of HMI-9 supplemented with G418, and 1-ml aliquots were plated onto 24-well tissue culture plates. After 24 h, selection was applied by addition of 2.5 μg/ml phleomycin, and the medium was changed everyday for 3 days. Stable clones were evident after 7-10 days. RNAi was induced by addition of 1 μg/ml tetracycline to the medium. Expression of TbHA1, TbHA2, and TbHA3 in Yeast—The full-length coding regions of TbHA1, TbHA2, and TbHA3 were amplified from T. brucei procyclic form genomic DNA using primers YA1P51 (5′-CTCGAGAACATGGGGGATACTGGA-3′, with the XhoI site underlined) and YA1P31 (5′-ACTAGTTTAAATAGGTTCCTTAGAC-3′, with the SpeI site underlined), primers YA2P51 (5′-CTCGAGAAAATGGCATATGGGTTGCC-3′) and YA2P31 (5′-ACTAGTTTATAGTGTAGGTTCTTTAG-3′), and primers YA3P51 (5′-CTCGAGAACATGGGGGATACTGGA-3′) and YA3P31 (5′-ACTAGTTTATAGTGTAGGTTCTTTAG-3′), respectively. The PCR products were subcloned into the XhoI and SpeI sites of pMP625 to generate plasmids pRD051 (pMP625/TbHA1), pRD052 (pMP625/TbHA2), and pRD053 (pMP625/TbHA3). All PCR amplifications were carried out using Pfu DNA polymerase, which exhibits the lowest error rate of any thermostable DNA polymerase. The PCRs were performed in a total reaction volume of 50 μl for 25 cycles at 96 °C for 1 min, 55-60 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 2 min using a thermal cycler. All constructs were sequenced to confirm their identity. Proton Pump Activity—Acidification of internal compartments was followed by measurement of changes in the absorbance of acridine orange at the wavelength pair 493-530 nm in an SLM-Aminco DW2000 dual-wavelength spectrophotometer. Procyclic forms were incubated at 30 °C in 2.5 ml of standard reaction medium containing 125 mm sucrose, 65 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.4) with or without 1.5 μm digitonin before addition of 3 μm acridine orange. The results shown are representative of at least three experiments. pHi Measurements—pHi was measured fluorometrically using 2′,7′-bis(2-carboxyethyl)-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein and the methods described previously (2VanderHeyden N. Wong J. Docampo R. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 53-62Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The fluorescence ratios, with wavelengths for excitation set at 505/440 nm and for emission at 530 nm, were recorded and translated into pH values on the basis of the ratios obtained at various pH values as described previously (2VanderHeyden N. Wong J. Docampo R. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 53-62Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Acid loading was accomplished by preincubating 1.5 × 107 cells in 60 μl of standard buffer (135 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 5 mm glucose, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgSO4, and 10 mm Hepes/Tris (pH 7.4)) containing 40 mm NH4Cl at room temperature (24 °C) for 15 min (NH4+ prepulse technique). Parasites were then centrifuged and resuspended in standard buffer. The traces shown are representative of at least three independent experiments conducted on two separate cell preparations. Cloning and Sequence Analysis of T. brucei H+-ATPases—To screen for genes encoding P-type H+-ATPases in T. brucei, the amino acid sequences of P-type H+-ATPases from T. cruzi (9Luo S. Scott D.A. Docampo R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44497-44506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) were used to search all available sequence data bases using TBLASTN. This search yielded three putative open reading frames designated TbHA1, TbHA2, and TbHA3, which have a high identity to T. cruzi P-type H+-ATPases (76%). On the basis of this information, we cloned TbHA1, TbHA2, and TbHA3 by reverse transcription-PCR. A 1.2-kb cDNA fragment was used to design appropriate gene-specific primers for the generation"
https://openalex.org/W1965998885,"Activation of the MAPK cascade during mitosis is critical for spindle assembly and normal mitotic progression. The underlying regulatory mechanisms that control activation of the MEK/MAPK cascade during mitosis are poorly understood. Here we purified and characterized the MEK kinase activity present in Xenopus M phase-arrested egg extracts. Our results show that B-Raf was the critical MEK kinase required for M phase activation of the MAPK pathway. Consistent with this, B-Raf was activated and underwent hyperphosphorylation in an M phase-dependent manner. Interestingly B-Raf hyperphosphorylation at mitosis occurred, at least in part, as a consequence of a feedback loop involving MAPK-mediated phosphorylation within a conserved C-terminal SPKTP motif. The kinase activity of a B-Raf mutant defective at both phosphorylation sites was substantially greater than its wild type counterpart when incubated in Xenopus M phase egg extracts. Furthermore suppression of MAPK feedback at mitosis enhanced B-Raf activity, whereas constitutive activation of MAPK at mitosis strongly suppressed B-Raf activity. These results suggest that feedback phosphorylation by MAPK negatively regulates B-Raf activity at mitosis. Collectively our data demonstrate for the first time a role for B-Raf at mitosis and provide new insight into understanding the regulation and function of B-Raf during cell proliferation.

Activation of the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK (MAPK) pathway by mitogen stimulation promotes entry into the cell cycle and G1/S cell cycle progression (for reviews, see Refs. 1Kolch W. Biochem.

Rev. 2001; 22: 153-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (3501) Google Scholar). MAPK signaling is also important for the G2/M transition (3Liu X. Yan S. Zhou T. Terada Y. Erikson R.L. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 763-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 4Wright J.H. Munar E. Jameson D.R. Andreassen P.R. Margolis R.L. Seger R. Krebs E.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

During mitosis, active phosphorylated forms of MEK1/2 and ERK1/2 localize to discrete structures of the mitotic spindle apparatus (7Shapiro P.S. Vaisberg E. Hunt A.J. Tolwinski N.S. Whalen A.M.

Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 1547-1558Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Previously we reported that MAPK activation during mitosis is absolutely required for the assembly and stability of the mitotic spindle in both Xenopus egg extracts and mammalian cells (9Horne M.M. Guadagno T.M. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 1021-1028Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Inhibition or depletion of MAPK from Xenopus egg extracts results in defective spindle structures and an alteration to microtubule dynamics (9Horne M.M. Guadagno T.M. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 1021-1028Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Therefore, regulation of cell proliferation by the MAPK pathway extends to the key events of M phase. The underlying biochemical mechanisms that control transient activation of the MEK/MAPK cascade during mitosis are poorly understood. Raf-1 has been implicated at mitosis because it is activated in nocodazole-arrested fibroblast cells (10Hayne C. Tzivion G. Luo Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31876-31882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 11Laird A.D. Taylor S.J. Oberst M. Shalloway D. J. Biol.

Zhou T. Terada Y. Erikson R.L. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 763-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). However, mitotic activated Raf-1 was shown to be uncoupled to MEK/ERK activation (10Hayne C. Tzivion G. Luo Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31876-31882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 12Ziogas A. Lorenz I.C. Moelling K. Radziwill G. J. Biol.

Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1109-1116PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that perhaps another MEK kinase is required for activation of the MAPK pathway at mitosis. A study by Yue and Ferrell (15Yue J. Ferrell Jr., J.E. Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: 1581-1586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) detected small amounts of germ cell-specific MEK kinase, c-Mos, in Xenopus egg extracts and provided evidence that c-Mos was important for activating the MAPK pathway at mitosis. However, c-Mos protein is in general undetectable in most somatic tissues, and earlier studies show that c-Mos protein is efficiently degraded and undetectable after egg fertilization (16Watanabe N. Hunt T. Ikawa Y. Sagata N. Nature. 1991; 352: 247-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 17Watanabe N. Vande Woude G.F. Ikawa Y. Sagata N. Nature. 1989; 342: 505-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Thus, the MEK kinase responsible for activating MEK during mitosis remains uncertain. In this study we purified a MEK kinase activity from Xenopus M phase-arrested egg extracts and identified B-Raf as its major component. We demonstrated for the first time that B-Raf is essential for activating the MAPK pathway at M phase. Further analysis showed that B-Raf becomes activated during mitosis and undergoes negative feedback regulation via phosphorylation at its C-terminal SPKTP motif by MAPK. Preparation of Xenopus Egg Extracts—S phase extracts were prepared essentially as described previously (18Chen R.H. Shevchenko A. Mann M. Murray A.W. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 283-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar) except that dejellied Xenopus eggs were parthenogenetically activated with the Ca2+ ionophore A23187 (0.2 μg/ml) for 2.5 min. After Ca2+ ionophore withdrawal, the activated eggs were incubated for another 50–60 min at room temperature before processing into extracts. This method closely mimics the degradation of c-Mos that is observed following fertilization (see supplemental data S1). M phase-arrested extracts were prepared by supplementing crude S phase egg extracts with recombinant nondegradable sea urchin Δ90 cyclin B1 (75–100 nm final concentration) and incubating at room temperature for 60 min. Expression and purification of GST-Δ90 cyclin B was performed as described previously (9Horne M.M. Guadagno T.M. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 1021-1028Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Note that all preparations of M phase extracts were checked for the activation of MAPK and the absence of c-Mos protein by immunoblot analysis. Cycling extracts were prepared essentially as described previously (18Chen R.H. Shevchenko A. Mann M. Murray A.W. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 283-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar) except that eggs were activated by incubation with calcium ionophore A23187 as described above. Immunoblot Analysis—Primary antibodies used include the following. Mouse monoclonal anti-phospho (Thr-202/Tyr-204)-ERK (1:2000), rabbit polyclonal anti-phospho (Ser-217/Ser-221)-MEK (1:1000), and mouse monoclonal myc tag (1:1000) were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.; rabbit polyclonal anti-B-Raf (sc9002; 0.02 μg/ml), anti-Raf-1 (0.4 μg/ml), and anti-ERK2 (0.2 μg/ml) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.; and rabbit polyclonal MEK peptide antiserum (1:1000) was prepared by Zymed Laboratories Inc. (South San Francisco, CA) against an N-terminal 16-amino acid sequence of Xenopus MEK1 plus a cysteine residue coupled to bovine serum albumin (CPKKKPTPIQLNPNPEG). Secondary antibodies included species-specific alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-mouse (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories) and anti-rabbit (Sigma) IgG that were detected with the CDP-Star chemiluminescence substrate (Roche Diagnostics). Purification of Mitotic MEK Kinase Activity from Xenopus Egg Extracts—All purification steps were performed at 4 °C and assayed for MEK kinase activity. Mature Xenopus oocytes laid from 16 female frogs were processed into crude M phase-arrested extracts as described above. 24 ml of crude M phase-arrested extracts (∼1.2 g of protein) were ultracentrifuged twice at 100,000 × g for 1.5 h to isolate the cytosolic fraction. MEK kinase activity was precipitated by 20% ammonium sulfate saturation. The pellet was dissolved in buffer A (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2) supplemented with 25 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml chymostatin and applied to a 10-ml HiTrap Q Sepharose high performance column (GE Healthcare). The proteins were eluted with a stepwise NaCl gradient in buffer A: 0–0.3 m (40 ml) and 0.3–1 m (10 ml). Fractions that contained MEK kinase activity (0.17–0.25 m NaCl) were pooled and applied to a Mono Q high resolution 5/5 column (GE Healthcare). The proteins were eluted with a stepwise NaCl gradient in buffer A: 0–0.35 m (3 ml), 0.35–0.50 m (15 ml), and 0.5–1 m (3 ml). Fractions containing MEK kinase activity (0.37–0.42 m NaCl) were collected and analyzed for protein composition by Western analysis and silver staining with GelCode SilverSNAP stain kit (Pierce). MEK Kinase Assays—To measure MEK kinase activity, samples were incubated in 30 μl of kinase buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm ATP, 25 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm DTT) containing 0.5 μg of recombinant unactive GST-MEK1 protein (Upstate) for 20 min at 25 °C. The kinase reaction was stopped with SDS sample buffer, and reaction products were separated by SDS-PAGE. Phosphorylation of recombinant GST-MEK1 at serine residues 217 and 221 was analyzed by immunoblotting with phospho-Ser-217/Ser-221 MEK antibodies (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.). Alternatively MEK kinase activity was measured in an in vitro linked kinase assay as described previously (19Roy S. Lane A. Yan J. McPherson R. Hancock J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20139-20145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Briefly samples were incubated with 0.5 μg of recombinant unactive MEK1 and 2 μg of recombinant unactive ERK2 (Upstate) for 30 min in 30 μl of kinase buffer at 25 °C. Then the reaction was incubated an additional 10 min in the presence of 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and 20 μg of myelin basic protein (MBP) as a substrate for ERK. The kinase reaction was stopped with SDS sample buffer, separated by 15% SDS-PAGE, and transferred to a poly(vinylidene difluoride) membrane. Radioactivity incorporated into MBP was detected by autoradiography and quantified by ImageQuant software. Immunodepletion and Immunoprecipitation—To immunodeplete B-Raf from S phase extracts, 50 μl of extracts were incubated under gently rotation for 1–1.5 h at 4 °C with 15 μgof rabbit polyclonal B-Raf antibodies (sc9002) prebound to 5 μl of protein A-Sepharose 4B Fast Flow beads (Sigma). B-Raf immunocomplexes were pelleted by a quick centrifugation, and a second round of immunodepletion was performed. As a control, extracts were mock-depleted in parallel using an equivalent amount of rabbit IgG (Sigma). In a similar procedure, Raf-1 was immunodepleted from S phase extracts with 5 μg of rabbit polyclonal Raf-1 antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). B-Raf immunoprecipitations (IPs) were performed by adding 0.5–2 μg of rabbit polyclonal B-Raf antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) to 1–10 μl of Xenopus egg extracts diluted in 10–50 μl of IP buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 25 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4). Following a 1.5-h incubation on ice, B-Raf immunocomplexes were recovered on protein A-agarose beads (Sigma), washed twice with IP buffer containing 0.1% Triton X-100, and washed three times with IP buffer alone. Washed B-Raf immune complexes were used directly in an in vitro linked kinase assay or resuspended in SDS sample buffer and analyzed by immunoblotting. Phosphatase Treatment—B-Raf IPs from S and M phase-arrested extracts were incubated with 50 units of recombinant λ protein phosphatase (Upstate) in 50 μl of phosphatase buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 100 μm EDTA, 2 mm MnCl2, 5 mm DTT) for 30 min at 37 °C. To stop reactions, precipitates were washed with a copious amount of buffer containing phosphatase inhibitors (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 25 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4). In Vitro ERK2 Kinase Assay—B-Raf IPs were incubated with 20 units of recombinant active ERK2 (New England Biolabs) in 30 μl of kinase buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 2 mm DTT, 0.1 mm ATP, 0.01% Brij 35, pH 7.5) with or without radioactive [γ-32P]ATP (5 μCi/reaction) for 30 min at 30 °C. Reactions were stopped by the addition of SDS sample buffer and heating at 95 °C for 5 min. In Vitro H1 Histone Kinase Assay—To measure Cdk1 activity, 1-μl aliquots of Xenopus egg extracts were incubated in 30 μl of kinase buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 2 mm DTT, 0.1 mm ATP, 10 μm cAMP-dependent protein kinase inhibitor, 0.01% Brij 35, pH 7.5) containing 20 μgof H1 protein (Upstate) and 2 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP for 20 min at 30 °C. Reactions were stopped by the addition of SDS sample buffer and heating at 95 °C for 5 min. Reaction products were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE, and levels of histone H1 phosphorylation were determined by autoradiography. Generation of Wild Type (WT) and C-terminal APKAP Mutant Xenopus B-Raf Constructs—A Xenopus B-Raf cDNA clone was obtained from ATCC (Image Clone I.D. 6860469). DNA sequencing analysis confirmed a full-length Xenopus cDNA containing an open reading frame of 803 amino acids (see supplemental Fig. S2). The sequence data of Xenopus B-Raf have been submitted to GenBank™ under accession number DQ097958. The B-Raf coding region was excised at HindIII sites and subcloned into a modified pGEM transcription vector (kindly provided by Dr. Rey-Huei Chen from the University of Cornell) downstream of an N-terminal myc tag. The C-terminal APKAP mutant was generated by changing both serine 784 and threonine 787 to alanines in the conserved C-terminal MAPK phosphorylation site using a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Expression of WT and C-terminal APKAP Mutant myc-B-Raf Proteins—Expression of WT and C-terminal APKAP mutant B-Raf proteins was performed similarly to that described previously (20Sharp-Baker H. Chen R.H. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1239-1250Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Briefly wild type and mutant myc-B-raf transcripts were generated using the mMESSAGE mMACHINE T7 transcription kit (Ambion). 4 μg of purified mRNA transcripts were introduced into 21 μl of Xenopus CSF-arrested egg extracts that were supplemented with 2.5 μl of rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Ambion). Protein expression was carried out for 5 h with gentle mixing every 15 min at 23 °C. Expression of recombinant proteins was confirmed by Western blotting with myc epitope antibodies. To reproduce the S phase phosphorylation status of the recombinant B-Raf proteins, aliquots of translated WT or mutant myc-B-Raf proteins were introduced into S phase-arrested extracts in a 1:10 ratio and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. To induce M phase hyperphosphorylation of the recombinant proteins, aliquots of S phase extracts containing myc-B-Raf protein were driven into M phase by adding recombinant non-degradable cyclin B. Western blot analysis revealed that recombinant myc-B-Raf proteins undergo dephosphorylation during incubation in S phase extracts and acquire hyperphosphorylation during incubation in M phase extracts. Purification of Recombinant myc-B-Raf Proteins from Xenopus Egg Extracts—myc-B-Raf recombinant proteins were purified by immunoprecipitation using myc tag antibodies. Aliquots of egg extracts containing myc-B-Raf were diluted 1:10 in EB buffer (80 mm β-glycerol phosphate, pH 7.3, 20 mm EGTA, 15 mm MgCl2, 25 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 0.1% Triton X-100) and incubated on ice with myc tag monoclonal antibodies (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.) for 1 h. Protein A-Sepharose beads were added, and incubation was continued for 12–16 h with gentle inversion at 4 °C. The IP complexes were washed twice with EB buffer and twice with kinase buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 2 mm DTT, 0.01% Brij 35 or Brij 58) before applying to in vitro kinase assays. Purification of B-Raf as an M Phase MEK Kinase from Xenopus Egg Extracts—Xenopus egg extracts represent an ideal model system for purifying and identifying the MEK kinase responsible for mitotic activation of the MEK/MAPK cascade. First, Xenopus eggs provide a rich source of components of the MAPK cascade. Second, activation of the MAPK cascade is restricted to mitosis in Xenopus egg extracts that undergo synchronous cell cycles of S and M phases (5Guadagno T.M. Ferrell Jr., J.E. Science. 1998; 282: 1312-1315Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 21Gotoh Y. Moriyama K. Matsuda S. Okumura E. Kishimoto T. Kawasaki H. Suzuki K. Yahara I. Sakai H. Nishida E.

Finally the Xenopus egg extract system is amendable to biochemical manipulations not feasible with tissue culture cells. We used an in vitro kinase assay to detect MEK kinase activity in Xenopus egg extracts. Phosphorylation of recombinant GST-MEK at Ser-217/Ser-221 was detected strongly in M phase egg extracts compared with S phase egg extracts (Fig. 1A). Several MEK kinases have been shown to directly activate MEK1/2 including Raf family members (23Hagemann C. Rapp U.R. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 34-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar), mixed lineage kinase 3 (24Hartkamp J. Troppmair J. Rapp U.R. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 2195-2202PubMed Google Scholar), MEKKs (MAPK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase kinases) 1–3, c-Mos, and Tpl-2 (25Lewis T.S. Shapiro P.S. Ahn N.G. Adv. Cancer Res. 1998; 74: 49-139Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To ascertain the MEK kinase associated with the kinase activity in Xenopus M phase egg extracts, we developed a four-step purification scheme (Fig. 1B). Crude S phase extracts prepared from parthenogenetically activated Xenopus eggs were cycled into a stable M phase by the addition of non-degradable Δ90 cyclin B. By Western analysis we showed that the extracts were devoid of c-Mos (see “Experimental Procedures”). The crude M phase extracts were separated into cytosolic and membrane fractions by ultracentrifugation. The cytosolic fraction, containing nearly all of the MEK kinase activity (Table 1), was separated by ammonium sulfate precipitation. Approximately 90% of the MEK kinase activity was precipitated in the 0–20% ammonium sulfate cut and used for further purification by anion exchange chromatography on HiTrap Q Sepharose and Mono Q columns. Collectively these purification steps enriched MEK kinase activity by ∼260-fold (Table 1). At the final purification step, a single protein peak eluted from the Mono Q column (Fig. 1C) that contained MEK kinase activity as assessed by both phosphorylation of recombinant MEK (Fig. 1D) and activation of the MAPK cascade in an in vitro linked kinase assay (data not shown). Therefore, our results suggest that the kinase activity purified from M phase-arrested Xenopus egg extracts represents a bona fide MEK kinase.TABLE 1Purification of MEK kinase activityTotal proteinTotal activityaa.u., arbitrary units.

Open table in a new tab Silver staining analysis of the final MEK kinase active fractions revealed several protein bands. An example of one of the active fractions is shown (Fig. 1E, lane 1). A prominent protein band between 90 and 100 kDa correlated with M phase MEK kinase activity and migrated at a molecular mass range similar to that of B-Raf. Therefore, we used a polyclonal antibody raised against a highly conserved N-terminal domain of human B-Raf (supplemental Fig. S2) that was able to detect Xenopus B-Raf in crude S and M phase egg extracts as a 95-kDa doublet (Fig. 1E, lanes 5 and 6). Indeed when a purified fraction containing mitotic MEK kinase activity was immunoblotted with the B-Raf antibody, B-Raf was strongly detected (Fig. 1E, lane 2 versus lane 6). In contrast, neither c-Mos nor Raf-1 were detected in the MEK kinase active fraction (lanes 3 and 4). Similar results were observed for other fractions containing partially purified MEK kinase activity. Thus, we conclude that B-Raf, not Raf-1 or c-Mos, is enriched during purification of the mitotic MEK kinase activity. B-Raf, but Not Raf-1, Is Required for Activation of the MAPK Cascade at Mitosis in Xenopus Egg Extracts—Based on the purification results, we postulated that B-Raf might be required for activation of the MEK/MAPK pathway at mitosis. To test this directly, endogenous B-Raf was quantitatively removed (∼99%) from S phase extracts by two rounds of immunodepletion (Fig. 2A), and the depleted extracts were cycled into mitosis by the addition of recombinant non-degradable cyclin B. At the indicated times, aliquots of egg extract were collected to assess MAPK activation. Entry into mitosis was monitored by nuclear envelope breakdown and chromatin condensation, which in control and B-Raf-depleted extracts occurred at 20 min after cyclin B addition. Following mitotic entry, MAPK became activated at 30 min in control extracts (Fig. 2B). In contrast, mitotic MAPK activation was strongly inhibited in B-Raf-depleted extracts (Fig. 2B). The addition of recombinant B-Raf protein to B-Raf-depleted extracts was sufficient to restore MAPK activation at levels similar to that in control extracts (Fig. 2B). Thus, we conclude that B-Raf is essential for activation of the MAPK pathway during mitosis in Xenopus egg extracts. Studies in mammalian cells have implicated a possible role for Raf-1 in G2/M progression (3Liu X. Yan S. Zhou T. Terada Y. Erikson R.L. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 763-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 11Laird A.D. Taylor S.J. Oberst M. Shalloway D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26742-26745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 14Lovric J. Moelling K. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1109-1116PubMed Google Scholar). However depletion of endogenous Raf-1 protein had no effect on mitotic activation of MAPK in Xenopus egg extracts (Fig. 2, C and D). Taken together, our data show that B-Raf, but not Raf-1, is required for mitotic activation of the MAPK cascade in Xenopus egg extracts. B-Raf Activity Is Cell Cycle-regulated in Xenopus Egg Extracts—Next we characterized B-Raf activity in Xenopus egg extracts. We predicted that B-Raf activity would be highest in M phase egg extracts based on its requirement for activating the MAPK cascade during mitosis. To measure B-Raf activity, equivalent amounts of B-Raf were immunoprecipitated from S and M phase-arrested egg extracts and subjected to an in vitro linked kinase assay. Our data show that B-Raf activity was markedly elevated (4–6-fold) in M phase-arrested extracts compared with S phase extracts (Fig. 3A). A modest amount of B-Raf activity detected in S phase extracts likely represents its high basal activity due to both constitutive phosphorylation and the presence of a phospho-mimicking aspartic acid residue in the positive regulatory N-region (26Mason C.S. Springer C.J. Cooper R.G. Superti-Furga G. Marshall C.J. Marais R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2137-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). Controls that either lack recombinant MEK and ERK or measure background kinase activity associated with rabbit IgG complexes demonstrated the specificity of the in vitro cascade reaction. To rule out the possibility that an MEK kinase associated to B-Raf might contribute to the activation of MAPK in the linked kinase assay reaction, we immunoprecipitated a catalytically inactive B-Raf mutant from M phase egg extracts. Our results show that the catalytically inactive B-Raf mutant contained no MEK kinase activity in a linked kinase assay compared with wild type B-Raf (supplemental Fig. S3) demonstrating that the activation of the MAPK cascade in the in vitro linked assay reflects B-Raf activity. Finally we examined B-Raf activity in Xenopus cycling egg extracts that naturally oscillate between S and M phases. Our results show that the activity of B-Raf fluctuates throughout the cell cycle and peaks highest during M phase (Fig. 3B). Thus, we conclude that B-Raf is activated in an M phase-dependent manner in Xenopus egg extracts. In a recent report, high amounts of B-Raf activity were detected in Xenopus egg extracts, but the authors were unable to measure differences between S and M phase egg extracts (27Yue J. Xiong W. Ferrell J.E. Oncogene. 2006; 25: 3307-3315Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). We speculate that the negative data could be caused by functional limitations of the two-component in vitro MEK kinase assay used to measure B-Raf activity. In our studies, we utilized an in vitro B-Raf/MEK/ERK/MBP-linked kinase assay, which allows greater signal amplification, and used at least 5-fold more MEK. Thus, saturation of the reaction by purified active B-Raf complexes is less likely to occur under our assay conditions. Therefore, we conclude that our cascade kinase reaction is more sensitive and reliable for detecting changes in B-Raf activity. Next we examined whether M phase activation of B-Raf correlated with its ability to associate with MEK, the direct target of B-Raf. B-Raf or MEK complexes were immunoprecipitated from S and M phase Xenopus egg extracts and subjected to Western analysis for detection of MEK or B-Raf, respectively. As shown in Fig. 3C, MEK and B-Raf were found in a complex together in both S and M phase egg extracts suggesting that their association with each other is independent of B-Raf activation at mitosis. M Phase Hypershift of B-Raf Is Due to Phosphorylation—As revealed by Western blotting, B-Raf, particularly the upper band of the doublet, undergoes a prominent electrophoretic shift at mitosis in M phase-arrested egg extracts (Fig. 4A) and in cycling egg extracts (Fig. 4B, 60–70 and 140 min).

https://openalex.org/W2081482806,"The effect of spermine on the inhibition of peptide-bond formation by clindamycin, an antibiotic of the Macrolide-Lincosamide-StreptograminsB family, was investigated in a cell-free system derived from Escherichia coli. In this system peptide bond is formed between puromycin, a pseudo-substrate of the A-site, and acetylphenylalanyl-tRNA, bound at the P-site of poly(U)-programmed 70 S ribosomes. Biphasic kinetics revealed that one molecule of clindamycin, after a transient interference with the A-site of ribosomes, is slowly accommodated near the P-site and perturbs the 70 S/acetylphenylalanyl-tRNA complex so that a peptide bond is still formed but with a lower velocity compared with that observed in the absence of the drug. The above mechanism requires a high temperature (25 °C as opposed to 5 °C). If this is not met, the inhibition is simple competitive. It was found that at 25 °C spermine favors the clindamycin binding to ribosomes; the affinity of clindamycin for the A-site becomes 5 times higher, whereas the overall inhibition constant undergoes a 3-fold decrease. Similar results were obtained when ribosomes labeled with N1-azidobenzamidinospermine, a photo-reactive analogue of spermine, were used or when a mixture of spermine and spermidine was added in the reaction mixture instead of spermine alone. Polyamines cannot compensate for the loss of biphasic kinetics at 5 °C nor can they stimulate the clindamycin binding to ribosomes. Our kinetic results correlate well with photoaffinity labeling data, suggesting that at 25 °C polyamines bound at the vicinity of the drug binding pocket affect the tertiary structure of ribosomes and influence their interaction with clindamycin.

Lincomycin and clindamycin (Fig. 1) are lincosamides, still used as therapeutic agents in human diseases and some animal infections. Clindamycin, a semisynthetic derivative of lincomycin (7(S)-chloro-7-deoxylincomycin), is usually more active than the parent compound in the treatment of bacterial infections, in particular those caused by anaerobic species (1Spižek J. Řezanka T. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2004; 64: 455-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Lincosamides act on the large ribosomal subunit and share an overlapping binding site with macrolides, streptogramins B, chloramphenicol, and other antibiotics affecting the PTase 2The abbreviations used are: PTase, peptidyltransferase; ABA, N1-azidobenzamidino; AcPhe, acetylphenylalanyl; DR, double reciprocal. center, as deduced from competition experiments and cross-resistance data (for review, see Ref. 2Roberts M.C.

Gharbi-Benarous J. Girault J.-P. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 2000; 8: 1225-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In agreement with most of these observations, chemical footprinting analysis (4Douthwaite S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 4717-4720Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 5Kehrenberg C.

Cell. 2005; 121: 257-270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar) have revealed that lincosamides interact with both the A-site and the P-site on the 50 S ribosomal subunit and would be expected to hamper the positioning of aminoacyl moieties of tRNAs at both sites. This last view is consistent with earlier binding studies investigating the competition for binding to ribosomes between lincomycin and 3′-terminus pentanucleotide fragments from N-AcLeu-tRNALeu, Leu-tRNALeu, and Phe-tRNAPhe (8Celma M.L. Monro R.E. Vázquez D. FEBS Lett. 1971; 13: 247-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 9Cěrná J. Rychlík I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 287: 292-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) as well as with the finding that lincosamides stimulate oligopeptidyl-tRNA dissociation from ribosomes (10Menninger J.R. Coleman R.A. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1993; 37: 2027-2029Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Tenson et al. (11Tenson T. Lovmar M. Ehrenberg M. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 330: 1005-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar) suggested that lincosamides bind to ribosomes allowing a space of ∼4.6 Å for nascent peptide progression toward the exit tunnel. Further peptidyl-transfer is inhibited by steric hindrance, and this inhibition eventually leads to peptidyl-tRNA dissociation. Therefore, an increased probability of ribosome drop-off can be caused by enhanced peptidyl-tRNA dissociation, decreased PTase activity, or a combination of both. In consequence, termination is also affected by both lincomycin and clindamycin (12Polacek N. Gomez M.J. Ito K. Xiong L. Nakamura Y. Mankin A. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 103-112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In addition to the inhibitory effect on protein synthesis, each lincosamide exhibits a specific inhibitory effect on the 50 S-subunit formation, an activity shared with 16-membered macrolide and streptogramin B antibiotics (13Champney W.S. Tober C.L. Curr. Microbiol. 2000; 41: 126-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Molecular modeling approaches have been used in at least three previous attempts to establish structural relationships between lincosamides and residues in the 3′-terminus of aminoacyl-tRNAs or hypothetic transition states and intermediates in protein biosynthesis (14Harris R.J. Symons R.H. Bioorg. Chem. 1973; 2: 266-285Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 15Cheney B.V. J. Med. Chem. 1974; 17: 590-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 16Fitzhugh A.L. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 1998; 8: 87-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). These hypotheses were later either contradicted by crystallographic evidence or never verified. Despite considerable interest for elucidation of the lincosamide binding site in ribosomes, kinetic studies concerning the inhibitory effect of these drugs on PTase activity are scant and exclusively focused on lincomycin. This drug cannot affect peptidyl-puromycin synthesis on native polyribosomes but inhibits transpeptidation with washed ribosomes and diverse synthetic peptidyl donors (17Pestka S. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 4669-4678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Besides competitive kinetics (18Hausner T.-P. Geigenmüller U. Nierhaus K.H. J. Biol.

Biophys. 1992; 298: 332-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), there is also evidence for a mixed-noncompetitive mode of action (20Kallia-Raftopoulos S. Kalpaxis D.L. Coutsogeorgopoulos C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 1009-1014PubMed Google Scholar) depending on the inhibitor concentration and the buffer system used. From kinetic and binding studies, it has been demonstrated that both monovalent and Mg2+ ions are essential components for the PTase activity and the binding of lincomycin to ribosomes (20Kallia-Raftopoulos S. Kalpaxis D.L. Coutsogeorgopoulos C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 1009-1014PubMed Google Scholar, 21Chang F.N. Weisblum B.

This is in agreement with the finding that lincomycin forms metal complexes in solution (23Gaggelli E. Gaggelli N. Valensin D. Valensin G. Jezowska-Bojczuk M. Kozlowski H. Inorg. Chem. 2002; 41: 1518-1522Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In fact, recent crystallographic studies (6Schlünzen F. Zarivach R. Harms J. Bashan A. Tocilj A. Albrecht R. Yonath A.

In addition to monovalent and divalent ions, polyamines are also essential for establishing an optimum ionic environment for ribosomal activity (24Bartetzko A. Nierhaus K.H.

Consequently, a prerequisite when performing in vitro experiments is to take into account the physiological conditions and to try as closely as possible to imitate them. Unfortunately, most of the kinetic studies concerning the binding of lincosamides to ribosomes and the inhibition of PTase by these drugs have been performed exclusively in the presence of conventional buffers. Moreover, they have been analyzed on the assumption that the equilibria involved in the interaction of the drug with the ribosome are attained instantaneously. In fact, there is experimental evidence that the lincosamide-ribosome interactions display biphasic kinetics (3Verdier L. Bertho G. Gharbi-Benarous J. Girault J.-P. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 2000; 8: 1225-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 19Kallia-Raftopoulos S. Kalpaxis D.L. Coutsogeorgopoulos C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 298: 332-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Contradicting observations have been published concerning the inhibitory power of clindamycin. NMR studies revealed that this antibiotic compared with lincomycin exhibits higher affinity for the ribosome (3Verdier L. Bertho G. Gharbi-Benarous J. Girault J.-P. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 2000; 8: 1225-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), in agreement with in vivo studies carried out in common pathogenic bacteria including Escherichia coli (1Spižek J. Řezanka T. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2004; 64: 455-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). In another study, however, the in vitro affinity of lincomycin to E. coli ribosomes was reported to be higher than that of clindamycin (4Douthwaite S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 4717-4720Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Kinetic studies of clindamycin interaction with functional ribosomal complexes have never been performed in the past nor has the effect of polyamines on this interaction been investigated. In the present study we examine the interaction of clindamycin with a post-translocation complex of poly(U)-programmed ribosomes isolated from E. coli cells. We employ an experimental approach by utilizing a series of polyamine buffers and by analyzing the peptide bond formation in the presence of clindamycin as a pseudo-first-order reaction. This approach allows us to have a picture of the entire course of the reaction. The use of polyamine buffers not only better resembles the physiological ionic environment but also gives us the opportunity to kinetically reveal the contribution of polyamines in the interaction of clindamycin with ribosomes. Materials—Puromycin dihydrochloride (disodium salt), clindamycin, spermine tetrahydrochloride, and heterogeneous tRNA from E. coli were supplied by Sigma. l-[2,3,4,5,6-3H]Phenylalanine and [γ-32P]ATP were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase was from Roche Diagnostics. dNTPs and dideoxy-NTPs were from Roche Applied Science. ABA-spermine was synthesized and purified according to Clark et al. (26Clark C.T. Swank R.A. Morgan J.E. Basu H. Matthews H.R. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 4009-4020Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Cellulose nitrate filters (type HA; 24-mm diameter, 0.45-μm pore size) were from Millipore Corp. (Bedford, MA). Biochemical Preparations—Salt-washed (0.5 m NH4Cl), polyamine-depleted 70 S ribosomes and partially purified translation factors were prepared from E. coli K12 cells as reported previously (27Amarantos I. Xaplanteri M.A. Choli-Papadopoulou T. Kalpaxis D.L. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 7641-7650Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Before their use, ribosomes were activated in buffer containing 20 mm magnesium acetate and 150 mm NH4Cl by incubation for 20 min at 42 °C. Samples were then cooled to 0 °C, and the Mg2+ concentration was normalized to 4.5 mm. Ac-[3H]Phe-tRNAPhe was prepared from heterogeneous E. coli tRNA, as described by Xaplanteri et al. (28Xaplanteri M.A. Petropoulos A.D. Dinos G.P. Kalpaxis D.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 2792-2805Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). It was charged to 77%, 100% being 28 pmol of Phe per A260 unit (Sigma). Post-translocation complex of poly(U)-programmed ribosomes, complex C, bearing tRNAPhe at the E-site and AcPhe[3H]tRNAPhe at the P-site was prepared in buffer A (100 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.2, 4.5 mm magnesium acetate, 150 mm NH4Cl, and 6 mm 2-mercaptoethanol) and purified as shown in the same study. Whenever desired, 100 μm spermine or 50 μm spermine and 2 mm spermidine were also included in buffer A. In the presence of polyamines, more than 50% of the used ribosomes was converted to complex C. This fraction was almost fully reactive toward puromycin. Photoaffinity Labeling, Mapping of ABA-Spermine Cross-linking Sites in 23 S rRNA, and Chemical Modification—Complex C was photolabeled with 100 μm ABA-spermine in HEPES buffer containing 4.5 mm Mg2+ and 150 mm NH+4, and the photolabeled product was purified as described elsewhere (28Xaplanteri M.A. Petropoulos A.D. Dinos G.P. Kalpaxis D.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 2792-2805Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The sites in 23 S rRNA to which ABA-spermine was crosslinked were identified by primer extension analysis, as described by Stern et al. (29Stern S. Moazed D. Noller H.F. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 164: 481-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). Binding of Ac[3H]Phe-tRNA to the P and A sites of Poly(U)-programmed Ribosomes—70 S ribosomes programmed with poly(U) were incubated for 30 min at 25 °C in buffer A containing 0.4 mm GTP and uncharged tRNAPhe at a molar ratio to ribosomes 1.5:1 to pre-fill the P-site. Subsequently, Ac[3H]Phe-tRNA was added and incubated for up to 30 min at 25 °C to allow A-site binding. Whenever required, 30 μm clindamycin was included in the binding buffer. The level of the A-site bound Ac[3H]Phe-tRNA was measured by nitrocellulose filtration. Bound at this site, Ac[3H]Phe-tRNA was almost no reactive toward puromycin. Total binding was measured by using poly(U)-programmed 70 S ribosomes with no prefilled P-sites. The P-site bound Ac[3H]Phe-tRNA was estimated from the total binding by titration with puromycin (2 mm, 2 min at 25 °C). Kinetics of the Puromycin Reaction—The reaction between untreated or photolabeled complex C and puromycin (S) (Scheme 1) was performed at 5 or 25 °C in buffer A containing 5nm ribosomes in the form of complex C and puromycin at concentrations varying from 0.1 to 2 mm (30Petropoulos A.D.

Whenever required, 100 μm spermine or 50 μm spermine and 2 mm spermidine were also included in the reaction mixture. The product (P), Ac[3H]Phe-puromycin, was extracted in ethyl acetate, and its radioactivity was measured in a liquid scintillation spectrometer. Background controls (minus puromycin) were subtracted. The product was expressed as percentage (x) of the radioactivity contained in complex C. The values of x, appropriately corrected (30Petropoulos A.D. Xaplanteri M.A. Dinos G.P. Wilson D.N. Kalpaxis D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 26518-26525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), were fitted into Equation 1,ln100100-x=kobs·t(Eq. 1) where t is the reaction time, and kobs is the pseudo-first-order rate constant. As previously justified (31Synetos D. Coutsogeorgopoulos C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 923: 275-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 32Katunin V.I. Muth G.W. Strobel S.A. Wintermeyer W. Rodnina M.V. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 339-346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), the kobs value is related to the puromycin concentration by Equation 2,kobs=k3[S]Ks+[S](Eq. 2) where k3 represents the catalytic rate constant of PTase, and Ks is the dissociation constant of the encounter complex between puromycin and complex C. The k3 and Ks values were calculated from DR plots (1/kobs versus 1/[S]) derived from Equation 2. Kinetics of the Puromycin Reaction Inhibition by Clindamycin—In this series of experiments, complex C in buffer A was added to a mixture containing puromycin and clindamycin. At 25 °C, biphasic time-plots (ln[100/(100 - x)] versus t) were obtained. The initial slope of each curve was taken as a measure of the apparent rate constant (kobs)o at the early phase of the reaction. Similarly, the slope of the slow-onset straight line was taken as the value of the apparent rate constant (kobs)s at the late phase of the reaction. Alternatively, the (kobs)o and (kobs)s values were estimated by fitting the data to a two-exponential function. Both methods of data processing resulted in the same rateconstant values. At 5 °C, single-phase time plots were obtained, and one value for kobs was calculated. Statistics—One-way of variance was used to estimate the mean value and data variability. Statistically significant differences were determined using the unpaired Student's t test. Effect of Clindamycin on the Binding of Ac[3H]Phe-tRNA to the A and P sites of Poly(U)-programmed Ribosomes—Binding experiments were performed at 25 °C under several ionic conditions in the presence or in the absence of clindamycin. To estimate the maximum level of binding, we followed the entire course of the reaction. As shown in Fig. 2, clindamycin hardly affects the binding of AcPhe-tRNA to both sites of poly(U)-programmed ribosomes if the binding is performed in the absence of polyamines; although a small increase in binding is visible in the presence of clindamycin, the differences from the control values are not statistically significant (p < 0.05). In accordance with previous results (24Bartetzko A. Nierhaus K.H. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 164: 650-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 33Karahalios P. Mamos P. Karigiannis G. Kalpaxis D.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 258: 437-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar), spermine or a mixture of spermine and spermidine stimulates the AcPhe-tRNA binding and enhances the stability of the formed 70 S initiation complex. The addition of clindamycin into the polyamine buffer improves further the AcPhe-tRNA binding to both sites but impairs the stability of the initiation ribosomal complex formed. Inhibition of AcPhe-Puromycin Synthesis by Clindamycin—The reaction shown in Scheme 1 represents the synthesis of AcPhe-puromycin from complex C and puromycin in excess. It proceeds as an irreversible pseudo-first-order reaction in which C is converted to C′, a species of complex C stripped of Ac[3H]Phe-tRNA and, thus, unable to react with puromycin for a second cycle. The integrated kinetic law expressed by Equation 1 predicts that the progress curve of AcPhe-puromycin synthesis is expressed by a straight line at each concentration of puromycin. The predicted linearity is indeed observed experimentally. A representative plot obtained at 200 μm puromycin and 25 °C is shown in Fig. 3A, upper line. However, when complex C reacts with a mixture of puromycin and clindamycin at 25 °C, the reaction displays biphasic kinetics, characterized by an initial phase followed by a late phase (Fig. 3A, lower line). The deviation from linearity is of vital importance in our analysis because it suggests a delay in the onset of inhibition. Analysis of the initial slopes by DR plotting and slope replotting (Figs. 3, B and C) leads to the identification of an initial phase of simple competitive inhibition, with one molecule of clindamycin participating in the mechanism of inhibition. This type of inhibition survives over a narrow range of inhibitor concentrations ([I] < 10 μm). The Κi value of 5.5 μm found at 4.5 mm Mg2+ and 150 mm NH+4 agrees well with the value of 8 μm for clindamycin affinity measured by footprinting analysis (4Douthwaite S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 4717-4720Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). However, it does not markedly differ from the Κi value for lincomycin so as to justify the superiority of the in vivo clindamycin potency. It should be mentioned that this inhibition constant determines only the initial encounter of clindamycin with complex C, ignoring late events of the drug-ribosome interaction. On the other hand, comparisons between in vivo and in vitro processes should be made cautiously, given that several factors in vivo may render one drug more potent than another. With increasing concentrations of clindamycin the competition at 25 °C becomes stronger (Fig. 3C). We suppose that at high concentrations of clindamycin a new relation of the drug to the puromycin binding site is established. This alteration becomes more pronounced when the late phase of puromycin reaction is analyzed. As shown in Fig. 4A, with increasing concentrations of clindamycin the DR plots meet the negative 1/[S] axis at the same point, whereas the slopes of the lines increase, approaching a plateau (Fig. 4B). Such a behavior characterizes inhibitors of the partial-noncompetitive type. Nevertheless, analysis of the Fig. 4A data by Hill-plotting (not shown) reveals that again, only one molecule of clindamycin participates in the mechanism of inhibition. Combined, these results suggest that clindamycin (I) reacts transiently with complex C to form the encounter complex CI, which is then isomerized slowly to a more stable complex, termed C*I. The partial-noncompetitive inhibition established at the late phase also implies that complex C*I, contrary to complex CI, is capable of accommodating the substrate and producing AcPhe-puromycin albeit with a lower catalytic rate constant than k3. The two phases of inhibition obtained at 25 °C are compatible with a model shown in Scheme 2.SCHEME 2View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We assume that at the late phase of the puromycin reaction, the unimolecular change of CI to C*I is at equilibrium. Consequently, k7[C*I] = k6[CI]. This also implies that P is produced via both the k3 and k3* steps. The Ks*, k3*, k6, and k7 values estimated as described previously (Refs. 30Petropoulos A.D.

According to these values, the overall association constant at 4.5 mm Mg2+ and 150 mm NH+4, kassoc, concerning both steps of the clindamycin interaction with complex C, is equal to 3.81 μm−1 min−1. As a consequence, the overall dissociation constant, k7/kassoc, becomes 13-fold lower than Ki, a fact suggesting that the affinity of complex C for the drug is much higher than that expressed just by the Ki alone.TABLE 1Equilibrium and kinetic constants derived from analysis of the inhibition of AcPhe-puromycin synthesis by clindamycinPuromycin reaction conditionsConstant (unit)4.5 mm Mg2+, 150 mm NH+44.5 mm Mg2+, 150 mm NH+4, 100 μm spermine4.5 mm Mg2+, 150 mm NH+4, 50 μm spermine, 2 mm spermidine4.5 mm Mg2+, 150 mm NH+4, complex C photolabeled by ABA-sperminek3 (min−1)2.00 ± 0.022.86 ± 0.05*2.50 ± 0.05*2.63 ± 0.05*KS (μm)486 ± 28510 ± 22505 ± 25496 ± 24Ki (μm)5.50 ± 0.301.04 ± 0.06*1.29 ± 0.07*1.50 ± 0.09*K6 (min−1)19.40 ± 1.2010.20 ± 0.70*10.26 ± 0.60*8.70 ± 0.60*k7 (min−1)1.55 ± 0.121.46 ± 0.101.34 ± 0.081.21 ± 0.09*k3* (min−1)0.049 ± 0.0220.052 ± 0.0280.044 ± 0.0270.049 ± 0.028Ks* (μm)404 ± 90445 ± 95403 ± 87412 ± 90kassoc (μm−1 min−1)3.81 ± 1.2011.20 ± 0.90*9.00 ± 0.77*6.60 ± 0.72*k7/kassoc (μm)0.41 ± 0.130.13 ± 0.01*0.15 ± 0.01*0.18 ± 0.02* Open table in a new tab In contrast to the results seen at 25 °C, single-phase time plots were obtained at 5 °C. A representative plot obtained at 200 μm puromycin and 1 μm clindamycin is shown in Fig. 3A (midline). As revealed by detailed kinetic analysis, increasing the concentration of the drug does not alter the type of inhibition, which remains simple-competitive (Ki = 5.6 μm) throughout the time course of the reaction. Polyamines Enhance the Inhibitory Effect of Clindamycin—To reveal the effect of spermine on the clindamycin potency, we re-analyzed the mechanism of inhibition using complex C, which was prepared in buffer A containing 100 μm spermine and then interacted at 25 °C with puromycin in the same buffer. In agreement with previous results obtained at 6 mm Mg2+ (30Petropoulos A.D. Xaplanteri M.A. Dinos G.P. Wilson D.N. Kalpaxis D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 26518-26525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 33Karahalios P. Mamos P. Karigiannis G. Kalpaxis D.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 258: 437-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar), the addition of spermine at this concentration increases the k3 value of PTase without affecting the Ks dissociation constant (Table 1). Consequently, the ratio k3/Ks expressing the activity status of PTase is enhanced by 43%. It should be noticed here that the k3 values estimated in the present study agree with previous literature values (31Synetos D. Coutsogeorgopoulos C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 923: 275-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 36Polacek N. Swaney S. Shinabarger D. Mankin A.S.

A. 2004; 101: 12893-12898Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar), but they are lower than those measured by fast kinetics (32Katunin V.I. Muth G.W. Strobel S.A. Wintermeyer W. Rodnina M.V. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 339-346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). This discrepancy seems to be due to the different experimental conditions and substrates used and, more probably, to a different accommodation of puromycin into the catalytic center. Nevertheless, the thermodynamic behavior of both systems is similar (38Dinos G. Kalpaxis D.L. Wilson D.N. Nierhaus K.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 5291-5296Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Despite the stimulatory effect on PTase, spermine does not change the type of inhibition by clindamycin. Thus, clindamycin again inhibits peptide-bond formation at 25 °C by binding initially to complex C in competition with puromycin. Subsequently, a slow isomerization occurs, resulting in a tighter complex C*I that accepts puromycin but produces AcPhe-puromycin with a much lower catalytic rate constant. Nevertheless, the values of certain kinetic parameters differ from those obtained in the absence of spermine (Table 1). Namely, the Ki value becomes 5-fold smaller. In addition, the k6 value is reduced by 52%, whereas the k7 value remains essentially constant. As a consequence, the overall association rate constant, (k6 + k7)/Ki, becomes three times higher, a fact that favors the formation of complex C*I. Similar changes in the kinetic p"
