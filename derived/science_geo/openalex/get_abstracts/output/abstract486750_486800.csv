https://openalex.org/W2045314069,"In most mammals, neurons are added throughout life in the hippocampus and olfactory bulb. One area where neuroblasts that give rise to adult-born neurons are generated is the lateral ventricle wall of the brain. We show, using histological and carbon-14 dating approaches, that in adult humans new neurons integrate in the striatum, which is adjacent to this neurogenic niche. The neuronal turnover in the striatum appears restricted to interneurons, and postnatally generated striatal neurons are preferentially depleted in patients with Huntington's disease. Our findings demonstrate a unique pattern of neurogenesis in the adult human brain."

This nomenclature is intended to serve as a standard of reference for the study of the brain of Drosophila and other insects. Thanks to their size, their relevance to medicine and agriculture, and their use for the development of novel molecular genetic techniques, insect brains have provided important insights in neuroscience research (Burne et al., 2011Burne T. Scott E. van Swinderen B. Hilliard M. Reinhard J. Claudianos C. Eyles D. McGrath J. Big ideas for small brains: what can psychiatry learn from worms, flies, bees and fish?.Mol. Psychiatry. 2011; 16: 7-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Like those of vertebrates, the brains of insects consist of various regions that synergistically cooperate to achieve computational tasks. These regions are given names that facilitate descriptions of neural circuits, the projections of specific neurons, and the distribution of molecules associated with neural functions. Existing nomenclatures for describing insect brains have, however, suffered from the following crucial deficiencies: (1) comparable brain regions have been given different names depending on the species and the researcher studying them, (2) the same terms and words have been used to refer to different structures, (3) the boundaries of many brain regions have not been defined clearly, and (4) some volumes of the brain have no established names and thus, by definition, have no defined boundaries. As in other sciences, neuroscience requires systematic and consistent nomenclature. Descriptions of brain and central nervous system are no exception, and many demand cartographic discipline. Linguistic inconsistencies detract from published studies or, worse, provide descriptions that are intelligible to only a few. Historically, insect neuroscience has focused on just a few well-known brain regions, such as those loosely defined as the “optic lobes,” “antennal lobes,” “mushroom bodies,” and “central complex.” However, comprehensive analyses of the development and connections of what are now recognized as elaborate and complex brains assume greater importance as whole-brain network analyses and behavioral genetics promise to link organization to function (Cachero et al., 2010Cachero S.

A systematic and consistent nomenclature that can be applied across insect brains in general is a prerequisite for such studies. Researchers of avian brains have faced similar problems and have solved them by agreeing to a unified nomenclature (Jarvis et al., 2005Jarvis E.D. Güntürkün O. Bruce L. Csillag A. Karten H. Kuenzel W. Medina L. Paxinos G. Perkel D.J. Shimizu T. et al.Avian Brain Nomenclature ConsortiumAvian brains and a new understanding of vertebrate brain evolution.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2005; 6: 151-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar). The present paper describes the results of a comparable nomenclature effort by a broad representation of neuroscientists working on the central nervous systems of insects and related arthropods. In 2007, requests from two independent bodies associated with the Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) resulted in the formation of a working group that discussed proposals for a systematic nomenclature of the insect brain. The Insect Neuroanatomy Meeting, held in March 2007 at the HHMI Janelia Farm Research Campus in Virginia, USA, brought together insect neuroscientists to discuss ongoing studies and problems in mapping neurons and their networks. This meeting acknowledged that a systematic nomenclature was urgently required, and an initial working group of seven individuals was formed. In the same year, the NIH Neuroscience Blueprint for Neuroscience Research, headed by Daniel Gardner and coordinated with the Society for Neuroscience Neuroinformatics Committee, invited a group of several neurobiologists working on the Drosophila brain to discuss a blueprint for a systematic nomenclature. These two groups subsequently merged to form the Insect Brain Name Working Group. However, because its members mostly worked on the Drosophila nervous system, invitations to join the working group were extended to scientists studying the brains of other insects (e.g., locust, cockroach, moth, and honey bee) as well as crustaceans, the sister group of insects. The aim of the working group was expanded to evolve a nomenclature that could be used across arthropod species. The fly Drosophila melanogaster is the most commonly used species in insect neurobiology and has an acknowledged impact in neuroscience research in the broadest sense. It is a proving ground for developing a range of genetics-based techniques for structural and functional analyses, and it serves as a test bed for the development of methods and algorithms for brain connectomics. For these reasons, the group agreed to use the brain of Drosophila melanogaster as the basis taxon for developing a nomenclature system. However, because it was recognized that the brains of different insect species are a consequence of more than 400 million years of divergent evolution, other taxa had to be taken into consideration if the nomenclature would apply across Insecta and reflect, as far as possible, a ground pattern organization that is common to all. Due to the working group’s geographical dispersion, discussions were carried out via an online mailing list initiated in early 2007. In addition to the NIH Neuroscience Blueprint meeting that was held in New York in 2008, the group twice held 2-day face-to-face meetings in 2008 and 2010 at the Janelia Farm Research Campus. Online discussions throughout the process further fine-tuned the present nomenclature. During the entire time course of this project, the developing nomenclature was presented at international meetings attended by a broad representation of arthropod neuroscientists. This enabled opinions and comments from the wider community. Such events included the Janelia Farm Insect Neuroanatomy Meeting in 2008; the Janelia Farm Meetings held between 2008 and 2011 on the mushroom body, visual system, brain evolution, and central complex; the Neurofly European Drosophila neurobiology meeting in 2008 (Würzburg) and in 2010 (Manchester); the Gordon Research Conference of Neuroethology in 2008 (Oxford); the European Symposium for Insect Taste and Olfaction (ESITO) in 2009 (Sardinia) and in 2011 (St. Petersburg); the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (CSHL) Banbury Conference on Evolution in 2009, Neuronal Circuits Meeting in 2010, and Neurobiology of Drosophila Course in 2012 (Cold Spring Harbor); the Japan Drosophila Research Conference in 2009 (Kakegawa) and Molecular Ethology Workshop in 2010 (Tokyo); the EMBO/ESF Minibrain Symposium in 2010 (Sant Feliu de Guixols); the EvoDevo Meeting in 2010 (Paris); the Max Planck Institute’s Neuro-Evo Meeting in 2010 (Jena), the German Science Foundation’s (DFG) focus working group meeting on “Metazoan Deep Phylogeny” in 2010 (Munich); the NCBS Maggot Meeting in 2010 (Bangalore); Fly Group Meetings at Edinburgh, London, Leicester, and Cambridge in 2011; the Cold Spring Harbor Asia Arthropod Neuroscience Meeting in 2012 (Suzhou); the SICSA/INCF Workshop on Atlas Informatics in 2012 (Madison); and the Nervous System of Drosophila melanogaster conference in 2013 (Freiburg). Throughout, the proposed nomenclature received strong support from the research community and benefited from many constructive suggestions that were incorporated into the nomenclature proposal. Establishment of a systematic nomenclature requires two steps: (1) a clear definition of the objects to be named and (2) finding the most appropriate names for them. To develop a nomenclature for the insect brain, its synapse-rich neuropils—where neuronal processes contact and form synaptic connections—needed to be distinguished as clearly defined volumes. However, except for a few neuropils, such as the antennal and optic lobes, mushroom bodies, and those of the central complex, many other brain regions have historically been referred to as “unstructured” or “diffuse,” with different regions distinguished only by approximate cartographic terms such as, for example, “superior lateral” in the case of the protocerebrum (Strausfeld, 1976Strausfeld N.J. Atlas of an Insect Brain. Springer-Verlag, Berlin, Heidelberg, New York, Tokyo1976Crossref Google Scholar). Though boundaries between neuropil volumes had been provisionally established using neighbor-defining landmarks (Otsuna and Ito, 2006Otsuna H. Ito K. Systematic analysis of the visual projection neurons of Drosophila melanogaster. I. Lobula-specific pathways.J. Comp. Neurol. 2006; 497: 928-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), those boundaries did not necessarily correspond to the organization of underlying neural architectures. To establish distinct boundaries throughout the brain, we first prepared confocal as well as paraffin serial section images that visualize various aspects of neurons and glia. These provided an initial framework for analysis. Simultaneous pan-neuronal expression of cytoplasmic dsRed (Verkhusha et al., 2001Verkhusha V.V. Otsuna H. Awasaki T. Oda H. Tsukita S. Ito K.

Reduced-silver-stained paraffin sections (Blest, 1961Blest A.D. Some modifications of Holmes’s silver method for insect central nervous system.Q. J. Microsc. Sci. 1961; 102: 413-417Google Scholar) have traditionally been used for constructing brain atlases and were useful here for resolving the fibrous architecture (Figure 1B). The anti-Bruchpilot antibody (nc82), which visualizes neuropils according to the density of an active-zone-specific protein (Wagh et al., 2006Wagh D.A. Rasse T.M. Asan E. Hofbauer A. Schwenkert I.

Anti-β-tubulin antibody was used to visualize fibrous structures of both neurons and glial cells (Chu and Klymkowsky, 1989Chu D.T. Klymkowsky M.W.

To satisfy diverse needs, we defined neuropils in a hierarchical manner (Table 1; Figures 2A and 2B). Large neuropil blocks (level 1 supercategories) and unit neuropils (level 2) are defined such that together they comprehensively partition the entire brain in a mutually exclusive fashion. Considering that synaptic markers like anti-Bruchpilot nc82 antibody are used as de facto standards to label neuropils, structures visible with these markers have been used to demarcate the level 1 and level 2 boundaries. In addition, wherever necessary, we have defined smaller substructures (level 3) within neuropils. Together, we defined 12 supercategories (level 1), 47 unit neuropils (level 2; 43 in case of Drosophila, because the other four are presumed absent in this species), and more than 40 subregions (level 3) with further subdivisions in some cases (see Supplemental Information for details).Table 1Summary of the Nomenclature System of the Insect Brain StructuresTop panel: Hierarchical list of the synapse-rich neuropil names. Bottom panel: List of the landmark fiber bundle names. See Supplemental Information for detail. Open table in a new tab Top panel: Hierarchical list of the synapse-rich neuropil names. Bottom panel: List of the landmark fiber bundle names. See Supplemental Information for detail. Taking into account all the information obtained with various labeling methods, as well as previous studies reporting various types of neurons, identified neuropil boundaries were imposed onto serial section images of a representative brain labeled with elav-driven cytoplasmic dsRed, presynaptic sites-targeted n-syb-GFP, and postsynaptic sites-targeted Rdl-HA using the Amira software painting function. By comparing a pool of preparations of 5- to 10-day-old adult female brains, the most representative sample was selected. Images obtained from a single brain rather than averaged images from many brains were used, because image averaging results in the loss of fine resolution. This tricolor-labeled series resolves all the landmarks required for demarcating level 1 and level 2 neuropils, because synaptic labeling of elav-driven n-syb-GFP closely mimics that of the nc82 antibody. Labeling of neuronal fibers and their presumed postsynaptic sites provided additional information for locating structural features suggested by other labeling methods. To meet the diverse needs of researchers, the Supplementary Information demonstrate several ways for understanding and synthesizing information about neuropils: (1) the 84-page Supplemental Information provides detailed overviews of neuropils and landmark fiber bundles, together with how to name and abbreviate them, as well as discussion about conflicting terms and solutions; (2) serial section movies (Movies S1, S2, S3, and S4) provide dynamic images of synaptic labeling and maps of neuropils and fiber bundles; (3) Movies S5 and S6 provide interactive clickable 3D maps, with which users can visualize any combination of defined neuropils (with Movies S5 and S6) and fiber bundles (with Movie S5) from any desired angle. This assists understanding of the spatial relationships among neuropils. With these guidelines and tools, researchers will be able to locate neuropils in their own specimens of interest when these are counterlabeled with synaptic markers such as nc82. In addition to these documents and movies, raw confocal image data files showing identified neuropils and underlying synaptic labeling are downloadable via FlyBase (http://flybase.org). They will be useful for spatially matching the provided neuropil images with the images of other brain samples using 3D registration software such as Computational Morphometry ToolKit (Jefferis et al., 2007Jefferis G.S.

https://openalex.org/W2151012511,"In sepsis, systemic inflammation leads to multiple organ failure and death. Now, Luis Ulloa and colleagues show that electroacupuncture can rescue mice from sepsis by causing the adrenal medulla to produce dopamine. Previous anti-inflammatory strategies against sepsis, a leading cause of death in hospitals, had limited efficacy in clinical trials, in part because they targeted single cytokines and the experimental models failed to mimic clinical settings1,2,3. Neuronal networks represent physiological mechanisms, selected by evolution to control inflammation, that can be exploited for the treatment of inflammatory and infectious disorders3. Here, we report that sciatic nerve activation with electroacupuncture controls systemic inflammation and rescues mice from polymicrobial peritonitis. Electroacupuncture at the sciatic nerve controls systemic inflammation by inducing vagal activation of aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase, leading to the production of dopamine in the adrenal medulla. Experimental models with adrenolectomized mice mimic clinical adrenal insufficiency4, increase the susceptibility to sepsis and prevent the anti-inflammatory effects of electroacupuncture. Dopamine inhibits cytokine production via dopamine type 1 (D1) receptors. D1 receptor agonists suppress systemic inflammation and rescue mice with adrenal insufficiency from polymicrobial peritonitis. Our results suggest a new anti-inflammatory mechanism mediated by the sciatic and vagus nerves that modulates the production of catecholamines in the adrenal glands. From a pharmacological perspective, the effects of selective dopamine agonists mimic the anti-inflammatory effects of electroacupuncture and can provide therapeutic advantages to control inflammation in infectious and inflammatory disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2112728955,"Recent studies have revealed that ARID1A, encoding AT-rich interactive domain 1A (SWI-like), is frequently mutated across a variety of human cancers and also has bona fide tumor suppressor properties. Consequently, identification of vulnerabilities conferred by ARID1A mutation would have major relevance for human cancer. Here, using a broad screening approach, we identify ARID1B, an ARID1A homolog whose gene product is mutually exclusive with ARID1A in SWI/SNF complexes, as the number 1 gene preferentially required for the survival of ARID1A-mutant cancer cell lines. We show that loss of ARID1B in ARID1A-deficient backgrounds destabilizes SWI/SNF and impairs proliferation in both cancer cells and primary cells. We also find that ARID1A and ARID1B are frequently co-mutated in cancer but that ARID1A-deficient cancers retain at least one functional ARID1B allele. These results suggest that loss of ARID1A and ARID1B alleles cooperatively promotes cancer formation but also results in a unique functional dependence. The results further identify ARID1B as a potential therapeutic target for ARID1A-mutant cancers."

Topical antibody administration in 25 patients with Crohn's disease led to detection of intestinal mTNF(+) immune cells during confocal laser endomicroscopy. Patients with high numbers of mTNF(+) cells showed significantly higher short-term response rates (92%) at week 12 upon subsequent anti-TNF therapy as compared to patients with low amounts of mTNF(+) cells (15%). This clinical response in the former patients was sustained over a follow-up period of 1 year and was associated with mucosal healing observed in follow-up endoscopy. These data indicate that molecular imaging with fluorescent antibodies has the potential to predict therapeutic responses to biological treatment and can be used for personalized medicine in Crohn's disease and autoimmune or inflammatory disorders."

https://openalex.org/W2057130382,"To maintain genome function and stability, DNA sequence and its organization into chromatin must be duplicated during cell division. Understanding how entire chromosomes are copied remains a major challenge. Here, we use nascent chromatin capture (NCC) to profile chromatin proteome dynamics during replication in human cells. NCC relies on biotin-dUTP labelling of replicating DNA, affinity purification and quantitative proteomics. Comparing nascent chromatin with mature post-replicative chromatin, we provide association dynamics for 3,995 proteins. The replication machinery and 485 chromatin factors such as CAF-1, DNMT1 and SUV39h1 are enriched in nascent chromatin, whereas 170 factors including histone H1, DNMT3, MBD1-3 and PRC1 show delayed association. This correlates with H4K5K12diAc removal and H3K9me1 accumulation, whereas H3K27me3 and H3K9me3 remain unchanged. Finally, we combine NCC enrichment with experimentally derived chromatin probabilities to predict a function in nascent chromatin for 93 uncharacterized proteins, and identify FAM111A as a replication factor required for PCNA loading. Together, this provides an extensive resource to understand genome and epigenome maintenance."

This study has uncovered an important property of HSPCs that enables them to convert danger signals into versatile cytokine signals for the regulation of stress hematopoiesis. Immune cells of the myeloid lineage are often considered the first responders of host defense against bacterial infection; meanwhile, hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) may respond in a delayed fashion to ensure sufficient production of myeloid cells consumed during an infection. The response by HSPCs was originally thought to be of a passive response to the depletion of downstream immune cells, but more recent evidence suggests that HSPCs may participate directly by sensing systemically elevated cytokines through cytokine receptors and bacterial and viral components through Toll-like receptors (TLRs) (King and Goodell, 2011King K.Y.

It is well known that immune cells are potent cytokine producers upon encountering bacteria and viruses. When cytokines produced by immune cells and nonhematopoietic tissues accumulate to sufficient quantity, they circulate back to the bone marrow (BM) niche via blood circulation to activate HSPCs. Numerous cytokines, including IL-6, TNF-α, IFN-α, IFN-γ, TGF-β, and M-CSF, with the ability to regulate proliferation and differentiation of HSPCs have been identified (Baldridge et al., 2010Baldridge M.T.

Med. 2011; 208: 1563-1570Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). On the other hand, it is clear now that HSPCs can also respond to TLR stimulation directly, leading to accelerated myeloid cell production in vitro (Nagai et al., 2006Nagai Y. Garrett K.P. Ohta S. Bahrun U. Kouro T. Akira S. Takatsu K. Kincade P.W. Toll-like receptors on hematopoietic progenitor cells stimulate innate immune system replenishment.Immunity. 2006; 24: 801-812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar) and most likely in vivo as well (Megías et al., 2012Megías J. Yáñez A. Moriano S. O’Connor J.E. Gozalbo D. Gil M.L. Direct Toll-like receptor-mediated stimulation of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells occurs in vivo and promotes differentiation toward macrophages.Stem Cells. 2012; 30: 1486-1495Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). However, it remains unclear how direct pathogen sensing by HSPCs translates into signals directing myeloid differentiation under the stressed conditions. Conventional wisdom would suggest that TLR signaling activates lineage-specific transcriptional factors that can directly regulate differentiation within HSPCs. Currently, little is known about what transcription factors downstream of TLR activation might mediate this process. An alternative, but not mutually exclusive, hypothesis is that TLR stimulation activates a general proinflammatory program within HSPCs in order to induce cytokine production, which can act in an autocrine or paracrine manner to regulate differentiation. In this study, we have combined extensive mouse genetics and a microfluidic single-cell proteomics platform to show that HSPCs can directly respond to bacterial components via the TLR/necrosis nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) axis, and, in response, HSPCs, specifically short-term HSCs (ST-HSCs) and multipotent progenitor cells (MPPs), produce copious amounts of cytokines. In addition, single-cell analysis shows that HSPCs contain heterogeneous subsets based on their different cytokine production profiles. The cytokine production ability of HSPCs is shown to be regulated by NF-κB activity, given that p50-deficient HSPCs have significantly attenuated cytokine production, whereas miR-146a-deficient HSPCs display significantly enhanced cytokine production. Interestingly, HSPCs are significantly more potent cytokine producers in both breadth and quantity than the conventional known cytokine producers of the immune system, such as myeloid cells and lymphocytes. Furthermore, we have shown that HSPCs possess TLRs, functional NF-κB signaling, and cytokine receptors—an entire cascade of molecules necessary for translating danger signals into cytokine signals. Lastly, we have demonstrated the functional significance of HSPC-produced cytokines, especially IL-6, in promoting myelopoiesis in vitro and in vivo in neutropenic mice after chemotherapeutic treatment or BM transplant. We believe that this represents a previously underappreciated mechanism by which HSPCs convert danger signals encountered during an infection into a range of versatile cytokine signals in order to ensure efficient stress-induced hematopoiesis. This circumvents both the delay associated with having to wait for systemic cytokine accumulation and the need to “reinvent” the molecular circuitry within HSPCs in order to convert TLR activation into specific differentiation signals. To test whether any of the HSPC populations have the capability of cytokine production, we adapted a high-throughput, microfluidic-based technology to quantify a panel of up to 15 secreted proteins at the single-cell level (Ma et al., 2011Ma C. Fan R. Ahmad H. Shi Q. Comin-Anduix B. Chodon T. Koya R.C. Liu C.C. Kwong G.A. Radu C.G. et al.A clinical microchip for evaluation of single immune cells reveals high functional heterogeneity in phenotypically similar T cells.Nat. Med. 2011; 17: 738-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). HSPCs are rare cells in BM, with LSK cells (defined as Lin−Sca1+cKit+), a mixed population of long-term HSCs (LT-HSCs), ST-HSCs, MPPs, and lymphoid-biased MPPs (LMPPs) accounting for less than 1% and LT-HSCs accounting for less than 0.1% of the total nucleated BM cells. This microfluidic platform allowed us to simultaneously measure a large number of secreted proteins at the single-cell level from thousands of phenotypically defined cells. After sorting LSK cells and LT-HSCs (defined as LSK CD150+CD48−) with stringent gating criteria and reanalyzing the sorted fraction for purity (Figure S1A available online), we loaded the cells onto chips containing several thousand microchambers. After 12 hr of incubation with culture medium containing either lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a TLR-4 ligand, alone or with Pam3CSK4, a TLR-2 ligand, secreted proteins were quantified by an ELISA-based method (Ma et al., 2011Ma C. Fan R. Ahmad H. Shi Q. Comin-Anduix B. Chodon T. Koya R.C. Liu C.C. Kwong G.A. Radu C.G. et al.A clinical microchip for evaluation of single immune cells reveals high functional heterogeneity in phenotypically similar T cells.Nat. Med. 2011; 17: 738-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). At this time, nearly all LSK cells remained undifferentiated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis (Figure S2). Interestingly, although very few stimulated LT-HSCs produced cytokines, a significant fraction of LSK cells produced a wide range of cytokines upon TLR stimulation (Figures 1A–1C and S3). Cytokine production by LSK cells was stimulation dependent, given that few LSK cells had detectable secretion in the absence of stimulation. Furthermore, although LPS alone was sufficient to stimulate 12.9% of LSK cells to produce cytokines, a combination of LPS and Pam3CSK4 boosted the percentage to 37.9%, and many more cells secreted multiple cytokines, suggesting an additive effect of simultaneously stimulating multiple TLRs (Figures 1A–1C). Among the 12 cytokines studied, IL-6 was the most prominently induced and was secreted by 21.9% of LPS and Pam3CSK4-stimulated LSK cells, whereas the production of the other cytokines ranged from 7%–15% (Figures 1B and 1C). Among the 12 cytokines in the panel, most are produced by multiple immune cell types. However, some cytokines, such as IL-2, IL-4, IL-17, and IFN-γ are mainly produced by lymphocytes, whereas IL-1β, IL-6, IL-12, TNF-α, and GM-CSF are more abundantly produced by cells of the myeloid lineage (Janeway et al., 2001Janeway Jr., C.A. Travers P. Walport M. Shlomchik M.J. Immunobiology: The Immune System in Health and Disease. Appendix III. Cytokines and Their Receptors.Fifth Edition. Garland Science, New York2001Google Scholar). Interestingly, when unsupervised clustering analysis was performed on LSK cells, it identified two main cytokine clusters: a cytokine cluster (group i) including IL-6, TNF-α, IL-12, and GM-CSF that resembles the production profile of myeloid cells, and a cytokine cluster (group ii) including IL-2, IL-4, IL-10, and IFN-γ that resembles the production profile of lymphocytes (Figure 1D). LSK cells were divided into multiple functional subsets differing in their ability to produce group i and group ii cytokines, ranging from nonproducers (Figure 1D, subset 1), group i producers (Figure 1D, subset 2), group ii producers (Figure 1D, subset 3), to superproducers of all cytokines (Figure 1D, subset 4). When the cells from the four subsets were plotted onto the 2D principal component plane with the two vectors representing the two cytokine groups, subset 2 cells fell into the group i direction, and subset 3 cells fell into the group ii direction, whereas subset 4 cells fell between the two vector directions (Figure 1D, bottom), demonstrating once again the differential cytokine secretion profiles among LSK cells. LSK cells represent a heterogeneous population comprising LT-HSCs, ST-HSCs, MPPs, and LMPPs. They represent cells along a differentiation tree with successive loss of self-renewal ability while still retaining the full potential to replenish most, if not all, hematopoietic cells (Adolfsson et al., 2005Adolfsson J. Månsson R. Buza-Vidas N. Hultquist A. Liuba K. Jensen C.T. Bryder D. Yang L. Borge O.J. Thoren L.A. et al.Identification of Flt3+ lympho-myeloid stem cells lacking erythro-megakaryocytic potential a revised road map for adult blood lineage commitment.Cell. 2005; 121: 295-306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (919) Google Scholar, Forsberg et al., 2006Forsberg E.C.

New evidence supporting megakaryocyte-erythrocyte potential of flk2/flt3+ multipotent hematopoietic progenitors.Cell. 2006; 126: 415-426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Next, we asked whether the LSK heterogeneity based on cytokine production profile correlates with known HSPC subsets. To study this, we separately purified LT-HSCs (LSK Flt3−CD34−), ST-HSCs (LSK Flt3−CD34+), MPPs (LSK Flt3intCD34+), and LMPPs (LSK Flt3hiCD34+) from the LSK population and analyzed their cytokine secretion with the single-cell microfluidic chips (Figures 2 and S4). We confirmed that LT-HSCs lacked cytokine production with the use of a set of stem cell markers different from those used in Figure 1 because of controversy over what set of markers best defines HSCs. In comparison, ST-HSCs and MPPs were potent cytokine producers, whereas more differentiated LMPPs produced rather modest levels of cytokines (Figures 2A–2C and S4). Furthermore, similar to unfractionated LSK cells, ST-HSCs and MPPs remained heterogeneous in terms of cytokine production profile (Figure S4A). These results were succinctly summarized with principal component analysis in order to reduce the 12-dimentional cytokine intensity data set from six different BM subsets down to two principal components (Figures 2D and 2E). Principal component 1 (PC1) represents a measure of the overall cytokine secretion ability of a cell and is positively correlated with the intensity of each of the 12 cytokines (Figure S4C). When LT-HSCs, ST-HSCs, MPPs, and LMPPs along with unfractionated LSK cells and total BM were compared along PC1, a majority of LT-HSCs and LMPPs were clustered at the lower end of PC1, indicating very low overall cytokine secretions, whereas ST-HSCs and MPPs contained a large fraction of high cytokine secretors (Figure 2D). Principal component 2 (PC2) is a measure of cytokine secretion bias and is positively correlated with lymphoid cytokines (Figure S4D) but negatively correlated with myeloid cytokines (Figure S4E). When the six cell types were compared along PC2, LSK cells, ST-HSCs, and MPPs were heterogeneous with relatively even distribution across PC2, indicating that they contained a mixture of nonproducers, myeloid cytokine-biased, lymphoid cytokine-biased, and balanced producers. In comparison, unfractionated BM cells showed moderate myeloid-cytokine bias, and LMPPs showed moderate lymphoid-cytokine bias (Figure 2E). It is known that HSCs defined by current best cell-surface markers represent a heterogeneous population with biased myeloid or lymphoid lineage potential (Beerman et al., 2010Beerman I. Bhattacharya D. Zandi S. Sigvardsson M. Weissman I.L. Bryder D. Rossi D.J.

Beer P.A. Eaves C.J. Hematopoietic stem cell heterogeneity takes center stage.Cell Stem Cell. 2012; 10: 690-697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). A recent study using a single-cell barcode technology also demonstrated the highly heterogeneous nature of the LMPP population (Naik et al., 2013Naik S.H. Perié L. Swart E. Gerlach C. van Rooij N. de Boer R.J. Schumacher T.N. Diverse and heritable lineage imprinting of early haematopoietic progenitors.Nature. 2013; 496: 229-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). To add to the complexity, we have now shown that ST-HSCs and MPPs contain heterogeneous subsets based on their cytokine secretion profile. It is reasonable to speculate that the skewed cytokine production ability of ST-HSCs and MPPs may also reflect a biased lineage potential. Unfortunately, the current chip design does not allow us to recover the various cell subsets on the basis of their cytokine secretion profile for functional and lineage potential analysis. The possible relationship between the heterogeneous cytokine production ability and their lineage potential and functional capacity represents a future direction for research. NF-κB is a family of transcription factors central to the regulation of inflammation and immune cell activation. Almost three decades of research has elucidated many key physiological functions of NF-κB in innate and adaptive immune cells as well as its involvement in the pathogenesis of many immunological diseases (Baltimore, 2011Baltimore D. NF-κB is 25.Nat. Immunol. 2011; 12: 683-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). However, much less is known about the physiological function of NF-κB in HSPCs during inflammation. Because both LPS and Pam3CSK4 can activate NF-κB, which in turn can upregulate the transcription of many inflammatory cytokines in mature immune cells, we suspected that NF-κB might also regulate cytokine production in HSPCs. To test this, we first determined whether the important components of the TLR/NF-κB pathway were expressed at the protein level in HSPCs. Using a transgenic mouse that has a knockin of a RELA-GFP fusion protein at the endogenous locus (De Lorenzi et al., 2009De Lorenzi R. Gareus R. Fengler S. Pasparakis M. GFP-p65 knock-in mice as a tool to study NF-kappaB dynamics in vivo.Genesis. 2009; 47: 323-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), we found that all LT-HSCs and LSK cells were GFP+, indicating that all HSPCs express RELA (also known as p65) protein, a key subunit of NF-κB (Figure 3A). Then, we showed that both TLR-2 and TLR-4 receptors were expressed on the surface of LSK cells, and a subset of them express both receptors (Figure 3B), a finding consistent with previous reports (Nagai et al., 2006Nagai Y. Garrett K.P. Ohta S. Bahrun U. Kouro T. Akira S. Takatsu K. Kincade P.W. Toll-like receptors on hematopoietic progenitor cells stimulate innate immune system replenishment.Immunity. 2006; 24: 801-812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar). Next, we asked whether HSPCs have functional NF-κB activity upon TLR stimulation. To study this, we took advantage of a different transgenic NF-κB-GFP reporter mouse, one with GFP expression under the control of the NF-κB regulatory elements (Magness et al., 2004Magness S.T. Jijon H. Van Houten Fisher N. Sharpless N.E. Brenner D.A. Jobin C. In vivo pattern of lipopolysaccharide and anti-CD3-induced NF-kappa B activation using a novel gene-targeted enhanced GFP reporter gene mouse.J. Immunol. 2004; 173: 1561-1570Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). LPS stimulation in vivo upregulated GFP expression from 8% basally to 35%–40% in both LSK cells and LT-HSCs (Figures 3C and 3D). More directly, when purified LSK cells and LT-HSCs were stimulated with LPS and Pam3CSK4 in vitro, NF-κB activation was again evident by both the percent of GFP+ cells and mean fluorescence intensity (Figures 3E and 3F). These results demonstrate that both LSK cells and LT-HSCs contain functional TLR/NF-κB signaling that can be directly activated by TLR-4 and TLR-2 ligands. To determine whether NF-κB regulates cytokine production in LSK cells, we took advantage of mice deleted for genes important to the NF-κB pathway. NFKB1 (also known as p50) is one of the main subunits of the NF-κB family of transcription factors, and p50 deficiency results in defective NF-κB activity in various immune cells (Sha et al., 1995Sha W.C. Liou H.C. Tuomanen E.I. Baltimore D. Targeted disruption of the p50 subunit of NF-kappa B leads to multifocal defects in immune responses.Cell. 1995; 80: 321-330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1057) Google Scholar). In contrast, miR-146a is an important negative regulator of NF-κB activation by targeting its upstream signaling transducers TRAF6 and IRAK1. Thus, deficiency in miR-146a leads to enhanced NF-κB activity (Boldin et al., 2011Boldin M.P. Taganov K.D. Rao D.S. Yang L. Zhao J.L. Kalwani M. Garcia-Flores Y. Luong M. Devrekanli A. Xu J. et al.miR-146a is a significant brake on autoimmunity, myeloproliferation, and cancer in mice.J. Exp. Med. 2011; 208: 1189-1201Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar, Zhao et al., 2011Zhao J.L. Rao D.S. Boldin M.P. Taganov K.D. O’Connell R.M. Baltimore D. NF-kappaB dysregulation in microRNA-146a-deficient mice drives the development of myeloid malignancies.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2011; 108: 9184-9189Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar, Zhao et al., 2013Zhao J.L. Rao D.S. O’Connell R.M. Garcia-Flores Y. Baltimore D. MicroRNA-146a acts as a guardian of the quality and longevity of hematopoietic stem cells in mice.Elife. 2013; 2: e00537Google Scholar). When we subjected LSK cells from Nfkb1−/− mice (p50 knockout [KO]) and Mir146a−/− mice (miR KO) to the single-cell chip analysis, we found that production of all 12 cytokines was significantly attenuated in p50 KO LSK cells and enhanced in miR KO LSK cells in comparison to wild-type (WT) LSK cells (Figures 4A–4C and S3). Although 37.9% of WT LSK cells produced cytokines under costimulation, the percentage rose to an impressive 69.7% in miR KO and dropped to a mere 2.4% in p50 KO LSK cells (Figure 4A). Furthermore, the percentage of cytokine-producing LSK cells in Mir146a−/− Nfkb1−/− (miR/p50 double knockout [DKO]) mice was less than in WT mice, indicating that the lack of p50 is dominant over miR-146a deficiency (Figures 4A–4C and S3). In addition to the percentage of responding cells, the amount of cytokines produced on a per-cell basis was also enhanced in miR KO LSK cells and reduced in p50 LSK cells for all the proinflammatory cytokines (Figure 4B). These data demonstrate that cytokine production in LSK cells is regulated by the level of NF-κB activity. Tuning the NF-κB activity up or down is sufficient to increase or decrease the cytokine production of LSK cells in response to TLR stimulation. We also measured the coproduction of any two cytokines at the single-cell level (Figures 4D and 4E). Correlation coefficients (R values) were calculated for all cytokine pairs for WT, p50 KO, and miR KO LSK cells, higher R values indicating tighter coregulation. In general, WT LSK cells showed higher correlation coefficients than either p50 KO or miR KO LSK cells, indicating a better coregulation of these cytokines (Figure 4E, green blocks). This may be functionally important, given that many of these cytokines are often produced together by a single cell; e.g., myeloid cells produce TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-12 during an inflammatory response, and CD4 TH1 cells produce IL-2 and IFN-γ. Imbalance in cytokine levels could lead to undesired effects and pathologies. When we performed a principal component analysis on LSK cells of all genotypes, a myeloid cytokine group including IL-6, TNF-α, IL-1β, and GM-CSF and a lymphoid cytokine group including IL-2, IL-4, and IL-17a were again identified (Figure 4F). Plotting the measurements onto the dominant 2D principal component space revealed diminished production of both groups of cytokines in p50 KO LSK cells and enhanced production in miR KO LSK cells. Interestingly, enhancement in the myeloid component was even more prominent in miR KO LSK cells, suggesting miR-146a-deficient LSK cells have especially enhanced myeloid cytokine production. Overall, these results demonstrate that TLR-stimulation-mediated cytokine production in HSPCs is exquisitely regulated by the level of NF-κB activity. Cytokines produced by HSPCs are also produced by mature immune cells in the BM and periphery. However, we hypothesize that the location of HSPCs in the stem cell niche may represent an inherent advantage, allowing HSPC-produced cytokines to efficiently regulate their own fate in a more timely fashion during an infection or inflammatory challenge. To assess the functional significance of HSPC-produced cytokines, we first compared the cytokine production capacity of LSK cells with that of more differentiated progenitor cells and mature immune cells. To this end, purified LSK cells and lineage-committed progenitor cells (Lin−cKit+Sca1− and Lin−cKit−Sca1+) from BM as well as CD11b+ myeloid, CD4+ T, CD8+ T, and B220+ B cells from spleen were stimulated with LPS plus Pam3CSK4 for 24 hr. Then, culture medium was collected for multiplexed ELISA in order to measure a panel of 15 cytokines. Surprisingly, in the absence of survival and proliferative advantage after stimulation (Figure S5A), LSK cells produced far more cytokines in both quantity and breadth than mature myeloid and lymphoid cells in 24 hr with LPS and Pam3CSK4 stimulation. More impressively, even with much stronger stimuli, such as CpG, anti-CD3 and anti-CD28, or 100-fold more LPS, T, B, and myeloid cells were still significantly less potent cytokine producers than LSK cells (Figure 5A). In addition, LSK cells produced a wide range of myeloid and lymphoid cytokines, whereas mature myeloid cells and lymphocytes showed narrower cytokine production profile. Next, we determined whether the cytokines produced by HSPCs are able to influence hematopoiesis in vitro. First, we showed that a fraction of LT-HSCs, LSK cells, and myeloid progenitor cells expressed various cytokine receptors, including IL-6Rα, IFN-γR, TNF-R1, and TNF-R2, on their surfaces (Figure S6A). This is consistent with previous studies that provided direct and indirect evidence of cytokine receptor expression in HSPCs (Baldridge et al., 2010Baldridge M.T. King K.Y. Boles N.C. Weksberg D.C.

Using an IL-6 neutralizing antibody, we were able to determine the effect of taking away IL-6 produced by LSK cells on myelopoiesis (Figures 5B and 5C). Interestingly, in comparison to the isotype antibody control, the neutralization of IL-6 had a significant effect on myeloid differentiation. Specifically, the percent of CD11b+ cells produced from LSK cells decreased by about 50%, and the number of CD11b+ cells showed a 2-fold reduction over a 4-day period (Figures 5B and 5C). To extend the study to include several other abundantly produced cytokines, we found that the neutralization of TNF-α or GM-CSF, but not IFN-γ, also had an inhibitory effect on the generation of myeloid cells (Figures 5D and 5E). Interestingly, neutralization of IL-6, IFN-γ, or GM-CSF all decreased the number of LSK cells, suggesting that these cytokines produced"

Although the reciprocal balance of dopamine and acetylcholine in the striatum is well known, how dopamine neurons control cholinergic neurons has not been elucidated. Here, we show that dopamine neurons make direct fast dopaminergic and glutamatergic connections with cholinergic interneurons, with regional heterogeneity. Dopamine neurons drive a burst-pause firing sequence in cholinergic interneurons in the medial shell of the nucleus accumbens, mixed actions in the accumbens core, and a pause in the dorsal striatum. This heterogeneity is due mainly to regional variation in dopamine-neuron glutamate cotransmission. A single dose of amphetamine attenuates dopamine neuron connections to cholinergic interneurons with dose-dependent regional specificity. Overall, the present data indicate that dopamine neurons control striatal circuit function via discrete, plastic connections with cholinergic interneurons."

Exactly how such neurons receive and distribute mechanical signals during touch sensation remains mysterious. Here, we show that sensation of mechanical forces depends on a continuous, pre-stressed spectrin cytoskeleton inside neurons. Mutations in the tetramerization domain of Caenorhabditis elegans β-spectrin (UNC-70), an actin-membrane crosslinker, cause defects in sensory neuron morphology under compressive stress in moving animals. Through atomic force spectroscopy experiments on isolated neurons, in vivo laser axotomy and fluorescence resonance energy transfer imaging to measure force across single cells and molecules, we show that spectrin is held under constitutive tension in living animals, which contributes to elevated pre-stress in touch receptor neurons. Genetic manipulations that decrease such spectrin-dependent tension also selectively impair touch sensation, suggesting that such pre-tension is essential for efficient responses to external mechanical stimuli."

https://openalex.org/W2003538143,"Cytotoxic CD8(+) T cells (CTLs) play a major role in host defense against intracellular pathogens, but a complete clearance of pathogens and return to homeostasis requires the regulated interplay of the innate and acquired immune systems. Here, we show that interferon γ (IFNγ) secreted by effector CTLs stimulates hematopoiesis at the level of early multipotent hematopoietic progenitor cells and induces myeloid differentiation. IFNγ did not primarily affect hematopoietic stem or progenitor cells directly. Instead, it promoted the release of hematopoietic cytokines, including interleukin 6 from bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) in the hematopoietic stem cell niche, which in turn reduced the expression of the transcription factors Runx-1 and Cebpα in early hematopoietic progenitor cells and increased myeloid differentiation. Therefore, our study indicates that, during an acute viral infection, CTLs indirectly modulate early multipotent hematopoietic progenitors via MSCs in order to trigger the temporary activation of emergency myelopoiesis and promote clearance of the infection."

Although Brg1-null IPMN-PDA develops rapidly, it possesses a distinct transcriptional profile compared with PanIN-PDA driven by mutant Kras and hemizygous p53 deletion. IPMN-PDA also is less lethal, mirroring prognostic trends in PDA patients. In addition, Brg1 deletion inhibits Kras-dependent PanIN development from adult acinar cells, but promotes Kras-driven preneoplastic transformation in adult duct cells.

These data provide direct electrophysiological evidence that an astrocyte-dependent glutamate-glutamine cycle is required to maintain active neurotransmission at excitatory terminals. Synaptic transmission requires a continuous supply of neurotransmitter for release. Although most types of neurons use direct reuptake to recycle released neurotransmitters, evidence indicates that glutamatergic synapses rely predominantly on astrocytes for generation and recycling of glutamate (Hertz, 1979Hertz L. Functional interactions between neurons and astrocytes I. Turnover and metabolism of putative amino acid transmitters.Prog. Neurobiol. 1979; 13: 277-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). Biochemical studies demonstrate that astrocytes take up glutamate and convert it to glutamine, which is released into the extracellular space and taken up by neurons as a glutamate precursor in what is known as the glutamate-glutamine cycle. The cycle is generated by a segregated expression pattern for key molecular components. Astrocytes express high-affinity excitatory amino acid transporters that clear released glutamate from the synapse, along with glutamine synthetase (GS) that converts glutamate to glutamine, and transporters that release glutamine into the extracellular space. In a reciprocal fashion, neurons express transporters that mediate uptake of glutamine, phosphate-activated glutaminase that converts glutamine back to glutamate, and the machinery necessary for packaging and releasing glutamate through vesicle exocytosis (Danbolt, 2001Danbolt N.C. Glutamate uptake.Prog. Neurobiol. 2001; 65: 1-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (3762) Google Scholar). This model of cellular cooperation and compartmentalization predicts that efficacy at glutamatergic synapses is coupled to both astrocytic and neuronal metabolism. However, attempts to define a role for the glutamate-glutamine cycle in regulating excitatory synaptic transmission with standard electrophysiological analysis have met with limited success (Kam and Nicoll, 2007Kam K.

In fact, a requirement for the cycle has only been demonstrated during epileptiform activity, a disease setting in which glutamate release is greatly increased (Bacci et al., 2002Bacci A. Sancini G.

How can these in vivo studies be reconciled with electrophysiological analyses of isolated brain slices that suggest that glutamatergic neurotransmission can be sustained in the absence of the glutamate-glutamine cycle (Kam and Nicoll, 2007Kam K. Nicoll R. Excitatory synaptic transmission persists independently of the glutamate-glutamine cycle.J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 9192-9200Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, Masson et al., 2006Masson J. Darmon M. Conjard A. Chuhma N. Ropert N. Thoby-Brisson M. Foutz A.S. Parrot S. Miller G.M.

Neurosci. 2006; 26: 4660-4671Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar)? We reasoned that the lack of direct evidence for its requirement reflects the absence of an appropriate system in which to test this. For excitatory neurons with long axonal projections, the physical distance between the neuronal cell body and the presynaptic terminal limits the contribution of somatic sources to the pool of glutamate available for synaptic release. This suggests that a perisynaptic localization of the glutamate-glutamine cycle would be required for maintaining high-frequency neurotransmitter release from these neurons. We therefore investigated glutamate release from isolated nerve terminals by taking advantage of the anatomy of two well-defined projection neuron tracts in the hippocampus and the cortex. By acutely transecting the axons, we separated excitatory nerve terminals from their cell bodies while retaining the relationship of presynaptic structures with postsynaptic neurons and surrounding astrocytes. We found that these isolated terminals provide a reliable system for electrophysiological analysis of the role of the glutamate-glutamine cycle in excitatory neurotransmission. During moderate activity, we found that glutamate release could be sustained in the absence of the glutamate-glutamine cycle, but not indefinitely, suggesting that there is a reservoir of glutamate and/or glutamine. Using a stimulation paradigm with alternating periods of robust activity and rest, we identified an activity-dependent reduction in synaptic efficacy that correlated with a reduction in glutamate release. The reduced efficacy was greater with inhibition of astrocytic GS and fully reversed or prevented by addition of glutamine. Surprisingly, the rate of recovery did not differ in untransected slices, suggesting that in an intact brain, a local glutamate-glutamine cycle is the predominant pathway for excitatory neurotransmitter recycling. Furthermore, natural stimulation patterns derived from in vivo recordings resulted in a similar glutamine-responsive activity-dependent reduction in synaptic efficacy. This was observed at the level of individual synapses with minimal stimulation while recording intracellularly from CA1 neurons. Together, these findings demonstrate a role for a synaptically localized glutamate-glutamine cycle in maintaining excitatory neurotransmitter synthesis and vesicle release during periods of robust activity. To study the role of the glutamate-glutamine cycle in the release of neurotransmitter from axotomized terminals, we first focused on the Schaffer collateral pathway in the hippocampus. Synapses of the Schaffer collateral pathway are among the most extensively studied in the mammalian brain, and the well-delineated structure of the hippocampus permits simple isolation of the presynaptic Schaffer collateral axons from their CA3 cell bodies while retaining the structural relationship of the presynaptic bouton with the postsynaptic structures and perisynaptic astrocytes. Furthermore, bursts of 20–30 Hz activity lasting more than a minute have been observed in the mouse hippocampus during novel environment exploration (Berke et al., 2008Berke J.D. Hetrick V. Breck J. Greene R.W. Transient 23-30 Hz oscillations in mouse hippocampus during exploration of novel environments.Hippocampus. 2008; 18: 519-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Thus, Schaffer collateral fibers release and must recycle or synthesize large amounts of glutamate to sustain such activities. Studies in vitro have also demonstrated that stimulation of Schaffer collateral fibers at 20 Hz drives excitatory neurotransmission at a maximal rate and exhausts the readily releasable pool of vesicles in ∼3 s (Dobrunz and Stevens, 1997Dobrunz L.E.

Lo D.C. Limit on the role of activity in controlling the release-ready supply of synaptic vesicles.J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 9708-9720Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Beyond this time point, a steady state of vesicle recycling is established, and the rate of neurotransmitter replenishment can define the sustained rate of release. With addition of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonists to block long-lasting plasticity, this experimental system allows for a direct electrophysiological analysis of the role of neurotransmitter synthesis in excitatory neurotransmission. In hippocampal slices with Schaffer collateral fibers transected and perfused with standard artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF), we established a stable baseline of evoked field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs) in the stratum radiatum with 0.2 Hz stimulation. A baseline was typically obtained within 10–15 min, and the fEPSPs remained stable for more than 60 min (Figure 1A, left panel). To test whether the capacity to release glutamate for extended periods of time depends upon the glutamate-glutamine cycle, we preincubated slices with methionine sulfoximine (MSO), an irreversible inhibitor of the astrocytic enzyme GS. GS is required for both the glutamate-glutamine cycle and synthesis of glutamine derived de novo through anaplerosis (Schousboe et al., 1993Schousboe A. Westergaard N. Sonnewald U. Petersen S.B. Huang R. Peng L. Hertz L. Glutamate and glutamine metabolism and compartmentation in astrocytes.Dev. Neurosci. 1993; 15: 359-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). With a stimulation frequency of 0.2 Hz, the fEPSPs in the MSO-pretreated slices remained stable for 60 min (Figure 1A, right panel), consistent with previous findings (Kam and Nicoll, 2007Kam K. Nicoll R. Excitatory synaptic transmission persists independently of the glutamate-glutamine cycle.J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 9192-9200Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, Masson et al., 2006Masson J. Darmon M. Conjard A. Chuhma N. Ropert N. Thoby-Brisson M. Foutz A.S. Parrot S. Miller G.M.

Neurosci. 2006; 26: 4660-4671Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). However, with the stimulation frequency increased to 2 Hz, after about 1,000 stimuli, there was a progressive reduction in fEPSP amplitudes in MSO-treated slices (Figure 1B, black trace). To confirm that this effect was due to inhibition of GS, we added 500 μM glutamine, a concentration in the physiological range (Moore et al., 1978Moore J.J. Sax S.M. Blackburn Jr., A.B. Determination of spinal fluid glutamine with the Du Pont aca.Clin. Chem. 1978; 24: 2213-2214PubMed Google Scholar). This mitigated the effect of MSO (Figure 1B, green trace and right panels), indicating that there is a reservoir of glutamate and/or metabolic precursors that can sustain activity during prolonged periods of low-frequency activity but can be depleted by periods of more robust activity. The experiments with MSO-treated slices indicated that the glutamate-glutamine cycle is necessary for sustained excitatory neurotransmission during prolonged periods of activity. We wondered whether the demand on an intact glutamate-glutamine cycle might be exceeded by its capacity during robust activity. Assaying slices not treated with MSO and increasing the stimulation rate to 20 Hz, we found that the fEPSP amplitudes initially increased and then rapidly decreased to the point of being nearly undetectable (Figure 1C, black tracing). If this was due to loss of glutamate and/or its metabolic precursor glutamine in the effluate, then supplementation with glutamine should attenuate the loss of synaptic transmission. With addition of 500 μM glutamine, the initial increases and decreases in fEPSP amplitudes were similar to those in control slices during the first ∼1,000 pulses (50 s), but after that, the relative fEPSP amplitudes were greater than those in control slices and remained stable for the duration of the experiment (Figure 1C, green tracing). This indicates that, in the presence of glutamine, synaptic transmission at isolated Schaffer collateral terminals can be maintained during prolonged periods of high-frequency stimulation. The rapid decline in postsynaptic responses seen with 20 Hz stimulation in the presence of glutamine likely reflects high-frequency-induced short-term synaptic depression caused by a limited availability of release-ready vesicles (Dobrunz and Stevens, 1997Dobrunz L.E.

Identification of a novel process limiting the rate of synaptic vesicle cycling at hippocampal synapses.Neuron. 1999; 24: 1017-1028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). We reasoned that a pattern of high-frequency stimulation alternating with periods of low-frequency stimulation might allow readily releasable vesicle pools to be replenished without necessarily allowing neurotransmitter levels to recover fully. This could lead to more neurotransmitter release over time and place a greater demand on glutamate supply sources. Therefore, we used a stimulation protocol interleaving high-frequency stimuli (HFS; 20 Hz) for 50 s (1,000 pulses) with low-frequency stimuli (LFS; 0.2 Hz) for 200 s (40 pulses), hereafter referred to as intermittent high-frequency stimulation (iHFS) protocol. We chose 50 s for the HFS interval both because this is the point at which we started to see an effect with glutamine in the continuous HFS paradigm, and because this is within the range of physiological bursts of high-frequency activity in the hippocampus (Berke et al., 2008Berke J.D. Hetrick V. Breck J. Greene R.W. Transient 23-30 Hz oscillations in mouse hippocampus during exploration of novel environments.Hippocampus. 2008; 18: 519-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). With the iHFS protocol, we are also able to analyze synaptic activity during the periods of LFS, without confounding factors associated with high-frequency stimulation such as changes in releasable vesicle pool size (Dobrunz and Stevens, 1997Dobrunz L.E.

Identification of a novel process limiting the rate of synaptic vesicle cycling at hippocampal synapses.Neuron. 1999; 24: 1017-1028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). With iHFS, we again found a decrease in the evoked fEPSP amplitudes during 20 Hz stimulation but also a further progressive decrease with subsequent HFS iterations (Figure 2A, left panel). When slices were treated with glutamine, there was also a decrease in the fEPSP amplitudes during 20 Hz stimulation train but full recovery between HFS iterations (Figure 2A, right panel). The time course of fEPSPs demonstrates a robust cumulative glutamine-sensitive reduction in fEPSPs with iHFS that persisted for more than 5 min after termination of the final 20 Hz iteration (Figure 2B, left panel upper tracings and right panel). In the glutamine-treated slices, the fEPSPs rapidly recovered to baseline at 0.2 Hz after HFSs. This suggests that vesicle pools are replenished quickly during LFS and that in the absence of glutamine, the incomplete recovery was due to depletion of glutamate available for neurotransmission. Interestingly, the reduction in fEPSP amplitudes with iHFS and subsequent recovery during low-frequency stimulation were similar in transected and intact hippocampal slices (Figure S1 available online). The fEPSP amplitudes remained reduced by more than half in both groups even 5 min after iHFS was completed. Although we suspected that limited neurotransmitter supply was the primary cause for the reduced fEPSPs after prolonged high-frequency activity, another possible explanation was that the efficacy with which electrical stimulation elicited an action potential waned. To determine whether this contributed to the reduced synaptic signaling, we examined fiber volleys (FVs) during the periods of 0.2 Hz stimulation. Aside from transient suppression during HFSs, FVs were stable over the course of the experiment and were not affected by glutamine (Figure 2B, left panel lower tracings; Figure S2), indicating that there were no long-term changes in intrinsic excitability of the stimulated fibers by iHFS or by glutamine. We next sought to ensure that the glutamine-responsive reduction in fEPSP amplitude did not reflect diffuse metabolic changes in the slice. To assess this, we compared input-output (I/O) curves from two laterally displaced stimulating electrodes, with one site stimulated as above with the iHFS protocol and the other (control) assessed continuously at 0.2 Hz, while recording from a single central recording electrode. With the iHFS protocol, there was a significant depression (rightward shift) of the I/O curve, especially for small-to-moderate FV amplitudes. This shift was not noted for the control electrode (Figure 2C, left panel) or for either electrode with slices incubated with glutamine (Figure 2C, right panel), suggesting that the effects of iHFS and glutamine are limited to the synapses that have been activated. To determine how long this effect of high-frequency activity on synaptic efficacy would last, we monitored fEPSPs during an extended recovery period. We found that after the iHFS protocol in aCSF, there was a slow recovery of fEPSP amplitudes that was still incomplete after 20 min (Figures 3A and 3B ). With subsequent addition of glutamine, the recovery of fEPSP amplitude appeared to be hastened and near complete within 20 min. We next compared recovery during an extended LFS period after completion of iHFS without and with glutamine. Without glutamine, there was little increase in the average relative fEPSP amplitude between 30 and 60 min after iHFS (0.53 ± 0.30 and 0.59 ± 0.29, respectively; p = 0.239, paired two-tailed t test). There was, however, a significant recovery when glutamine was added at the start of the extended LFS period (0.58 ± 0.22 and 0.82 ± 0.34, respectively; p = 0.0128, paired two-tailed t test). The addition of glutamine did not affect the FV but caused normalization of the I/O curve (Figure 3C), consistent with its specific effect on the stimulated pathway. The extent to which endogenous glutamine synthesized by astrocytes is required for the sustained periods of high-frequency excitatory synaptic transmission in our system is unclear, but the reduction in synaptic efficacy caused by the gliotoxins fluoroacetate and fluorocitrate suggests that astrocytes are required for the maintenance of excitatory neurotransmission (Bacci et al., 2002Bacci A. Sancini G. Verderio C. Armano S. Pravettoni E. Fesce R. Franceschetti S. Matteoli M. Block of glutamate-glutamine cycle between astrocytes and neurons inhibits epileptiform activity in hippocampus.J.

Synaptic transmission in the hippocampus: critical role for glial cells.Glia. 1994; 10: 237-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). To test this, we preincubated slices with MSO to inhibit the astrocytic enzyme GS. We expected that MSO would cause a more rapid reduction in fEPSP amplitude and that this effect would be attenuated by the addition of glutamine. We found that pretreatment of slices with MSO had little effect on the evoked fEPSP amplitudes during the first epoch of 20 Hz stimulation in the iHFS protocol, but with subsequent iterations, the recovery between HFS trains was much less complete than in untreated slices—ultimately, fEPSPs were abolished (Figure 4A, left panel). Even after 20 min of LFS, the fEPSP amplitudes did not recover in the MSO-treated slices (Figure 4B). With addition of glutamine to the MSO-treated slices, there was complete and persistent recovery between iterations of the high-frequency stimulation and no discernable difference between MSO-treated slices rescued with glutamine and slices to which glutamine alone was added (cf. Figure 4A right panel to Figure 2A right panel). Furthermore, when glutamine was added to MSO-treated slices after iHFS, there was a complete recovery of fEPSP amplitudes and normalization of I/O curves, again with no discernable difference with slices to which glutamine was added (cf. Figures 4B and 4C to Figures 2B and 2C). The effect of MSO and its reversal with glutamine support the hypothesis that astrocyte-derived glutamine is required for maintaining synaptic transmission during prolonged periods of intermittent high-frequency activity. Reductions in synaptic efficacy can occur through a number of different mechanisms, including changes in postsynaptic responsiveness (Collingridge et al., 2010Collingridge G.L. Peineau S. Howland J.G. Wang Y.T. Long-term depression in the CNS.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2010; 11: 459-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar). To confirm that our results reflect changes in glutamate release, we used two independent approaches. First, we used Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based glutamate biosensor imaging to measure extracellular glutamate transients (Figure 5A). This biosensor is a chimeric protein composed of cyan fluorescent protein (CFP) and the yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) variant Venus inserted into the N-terminal and C-terminal regions of the bacterial glutamate binding protein YbeJ, respectively. Glutamate binding causes a conformational change in the protein, which results in a decrease in FRET efficiency between the CFP and Venus. The biosensor allows for qualitative measurement of glutamate release in brain slices throughout an optic field with temporal resolution in the millisecond scale (Dulla et al., 2008Dulla C. Tani H. Okumoto S. Frommer W.B. Reimer R.J. Huguenard J.R. Imaging of glutamate in brain slices using FRET sensors.J. Neurosci.

Glutamate biosensor imaging reveals dysregulation of glutamatergic pathways in a model of developmental cortical malformation.Neurobiol. Dis. 2012; 49C: 232-246PubMed Google Scholar). As expected, we found a decrease in glutamate biosensor signal with evoked release following iHFS, and this was prevented by glutamine (Figure 5B). As a second approach, we used the competitive AMPA receptor antagonist γ-D-glutamylglycine (γ-DGG) to assess synaptic glutamate levels (Christie and Jahr, 2006Christie J.M. Jahr C.E. Multivesicular release at Schaffer collateral-CA1 hippocampal synapses.J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 210-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, Liu et al., 1999Liu G. Choi S. Tsien R.W. Variability of neurotransmitter concentration and nonsaturation of postsynaptic AMPA receptors at synapses in hippocampal cultures and slices.Neuron. 1999; 22: 395-409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). This low-affinity antagonist has rapid equilibration kinetics with AMPA receptors and competes with glutamate for receptor binding during the glutamate transient associated with exocytosis. As a result, lower concentrations of glutamate are more effectively blocked by γ-DGG. We found that the effect of γ-DGG was enhanced even after only two iterations of HFSs (Figure 5C). In slices pretreated with MSO, the effect of γ-DGG was again enhanced by iHFS, whereas with addition of glutamine to MSO-pretreated slices, the efficacy of γ-DGG was unchanged by iHFS (Figures 5D and 5E). Together, the findings with the biosensor and γ-DGG support the conclusion that iHFS leads to a reduction in glutamate release and reduced synaptic concentrations of glutamate. Although unfilled synaptic vesicles can undergo exocytosis, it has been suggested that presynaptic cytosolic transmitter content influences vesicle release in cholinergic (Poulain et al., 1986Poulain B. Baux G. Tauc L. Presynaptic transmitter content controls the number of quanta released at a neuro-neuronal cholinergic synapse.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Here, we report a chemical photoswitch named DENAQ that restores retinal responses to white light of intensity similar to ordinary daylight. A single intraocular injection of DENAQ photosensitizes the blind retina for days, restoring electrophysiological and behavioral responses with no toxicity. Experiments on mouse strains with functional, nonfunctional, or degenerated rods and cones show that DENAQ is effective only in retinas with degenerated photoreceptors. DENAQ confers light sensitivity on a hyperpolarization-activated inward current that is enhanced in degenerated retina, enabling optical control of retinal ganglion cell firing. The acceptable light sensitivity, favorable spectral sensitivity, and selective targeting to diseased tissue make DENAQ a prime drug candidate for vision restoration in patients with end-stage RP and AMD."

Cognitive control requires a balance between two incompatible demands: flexibly updating goals versus robustly maintaining them. One solution to this dilemma is to separate the neural mechanisms for working memory (WM) maintenance from those that update the information that is to be maintained, i.e., a WM “gate.” This computational division of labor is thought to have anatomical correlates, with prefrontal cortex (PFC) supporting maintenance and basal ganglia (BG) supporting gating (Braver and Cohen, 2000Braver T.S.

From this perspective, disinhibition of cortico-striato-thalamic loops enables the selective updating of task-relevant information into WM. Once maintained, information supported by PFC is available to exert a top-down bias on posterior neocortex (Desimone and Duncan, 1995Desimone R. Duncan J. Neural mechanisms of selective visual attention.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1995; 18: 193-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (5982) Google Scholar). This type of selective control over the input to WM, termed “input gating,” relies on dopaminergic corticostriatal systems (Frank and O’Reilly, 2006Frank M.J. O’Reilly R.C.

However, not everything in WM will be relevant for behavior at any one point in time. Rather, it is also adaptive to control which representations within WM can influence attention and behavior and when. Such selection from within WM or “singling out” of WM representations (Oberauer and Hein, 2012Oberauer K. Hein L. Attention to information in working memory.Curr. Dir. Psychol. Sci. 2012; 21: 164-169Crossref Scopus (175) Google Scholar) is resource demanding and PFC dependent (e.g., Rowe et al., 2000Rowe J.B. Toni I. Josephs O. Frackowiak R.S. Passingham R.E.

Neurosci. 2011; 23: 2905-2919Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, relative to control over the input to WM, little evidence exists regarding this type of selection process and its relationship to cognitive control. One hypothesis is that selection from within WM can be conceived of as a gating function analogous to that described above for WM updating. From this perspective, an “output gate” may control the flow of information within WM between an actively maintained but inert state to one that is capable of exerting a top-down influence on behavior. In other words, for any given WM representation, when the output gate is closed, that representation would be maintained but would not have a top-down influence. Conversely, when the output gate is opened, the maintained representation provides a top-down contextual signal. Output gating is a shared solution to the problem of selection from within WM across many computational models (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997Hochreiter S. Schmidhuber J.

Like input gating, output gating may be hypothesized to arise from cortico-striato-thalamic loops, wherein candidate contextual representations maintained in PFC act as input to dorsal striatum, which in turn amplifies one of these representations via its pallado-thalamic disinhibitory loop (Hazy et al., 2007Hazy T.E.

USA. 2013; 110: 16390-16395Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). This putative output gating dynamic for selection of a WM representation is an extension of more established interactions between the cortex and dorsal striatum during selection of a candidate motor plan (e.g., Mink, 1996Mink J.W.

According to this general class of accounts, some potential stimulus-response action plan represented by the premotor cortex is “gated out” by striatum and thereby becomes the motor plan executed by the primary motor cortex. However, the hypothesis that similar frontostriatal interactions could support selection of a WM representation currently lacks support. The present study seeks to fill this gap. To test output gating of WM, we focus on hierarchical control tasks requiring the use of conditional rules (e.g., the shape of a stimulus cues whether to attend to the size or color of a stimulus, and size or color then determines which response must be made). In the brain, simpler rules that directly map a stimulus to a response tend to recruit more caudal frontal cortex than rules involving higher-order contingencies (Koechlin et al., 2003Koechlin E.

Turner R. Friederici A.D. An anterior-posterior gradient of cognitive control within the dorsomedial striatum.Neuroimage. 2012; 62: 41-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Of note, such conditional rules rely on higher order contexts (e.g., shape) to select which lower order context (e.g., the color or size) should drive action. Thus, following such rules might rely on output gating, if these lower order representations must be selected from within WM. Indeed, a recent computational model predicts that performance advantages arise from rostrocaudal frontostriatal organization specifically if rostral frontal areas modulate the output gating of more caudal frontostriatal circuits (Frank and Badre, 2012Frank M.J. Badre D. Mechanisms of hierarchical reinforcement learning in corticostriatal circuits 1: computational analysis.Cereb. Cortex. 2012; 22: 509-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Although this model fits behavioral and fMRI data during hierarchical rule learning (Badre and Frank, 2012Badre D. Frank M.J. Mechanisms of hierarchical reinforcement learning in cortico-striatal circuits 2: evidence from fMRI.Cereb. Cortex. 2012; 22: 527-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), its predictions regarding the priority of output gating dynamics for hierarchical frontostriatal interactions are untested. To this end, we used a second-order control task to separately manipulate demands on output or input gating, while also controlling for differences in WM load. Subjects based their responses on one of two possible letters and/or two possible “wingding” characters depending on the identity of a number cue (Figure 1). The number acted as a higher-level context by specifying which set of lower-level items (letters, wingdings, or both) would be relevant to the response for that trial. The final stimulus event for each trial also included a set of response mappings. Subjects pressed a button corresponding to the side of the response mappings (left versus right) on which the relevant item(s) appeared (Figure 1A). Of note, each stimulus was presented in an unpredictable serial order on each trial. Thus, higher order context was presented either before (context first [CF]) or after (context last [CL]) the lower order contexts had appeared. Under CF conditions, subjects could use the number to select which of the subsequent items to update into WM. Thus, the CF conditions allow subjects to use an “input gating” strategy. Conversely, during CL conditions, subjects would need to input each lower order item as it was presented, because they could not know which was going to be relevant. Then, on presentation of the context in the last position, subjects would need to select from among the items maintained in WM that which would be allowed to influence the response. Hence, the CL condition requires subjects to use an “output gating” strategy. Because the successful use of an input gating strategy would also serve to reduce WM load when the context was presented first and only the letter or wingding was relevant (termed the CF, selective [CF-S] condition), we included a “global” context cue (e.g., the digit “3” in Figure 1A) that specified that both lower-level items were relevant for determining the correct response. Thus, in contrast to the “selective” context cues (e.g., the digits “1” or “2” in Figure 1A) that marked only a subset of lower-level items as relevant, a “global” context cue required subjects to utilize two items in memory, regardless of whether it was presented first (CF, global [CF-G]) or last (CL, global [CL-G]). These global trials therefore acted as a strong load-matched control condition for the CL, selective (CL-S) condition, wherein only one of the two items in memory was relevant for behavior and therefore had to be selectively output gated. This design allowed us to test the hypothesis that corticostriatal output gating mechanisms support selection from within WM. Specifically, by contrasting load-matched CL with “item last” conditions, we could test the prediction that corticostriatal systems support selection from within WM. Moreover, contrasting CL with CF conditions, we can assess whether regions previously identified with second-order hierarchical control are indeed preferentially activated and coupled with the striatum during second-order control over output relative to input gating. We focus here both on regional differences in BOLD activation between these conditions and changes in functional connectivity across frontostriatal circuits. Furthermore, this design allows us to test the maintenance versus gating division of labor between frontal cortex and striatum hypothesized to underlie output gating. In particular, the impact of each component to output gating should be distinguishable in separable behavioral correlates that can, in turn, be related to our brain measures. To illustrate this logic, we draw an analogy to the effects on driving duration of how direct a route is versus how frequently one encounters red lights along the way (Figure 2). Consider each trial in our task as a trip driven along a route from stimulus to response via representations in WM. Taking a more direct route to a location reduces all transit times along that route equally, relative to less direct routes. Similarly, maintaining a good rule or “policy” in WM—e.g., one that most directly and effectively maps a stimulus to the response—will also yield more efficient performance. Thus, during CL conditions, to the degree that strong prefrontal representations of context support more efficient responses, activation in the frontal cortex should predict speeded response times (RTs), and this speeding should be reflected by a constant shift across the entire RT distribution. In contrast, stochastic influences like traffic will fundamentally reshape, rather than simply shift, the distribution. Consider that traffic lights can, at best, impose no delay to the fastest transit time (i.e., when all lights are green) and otherwise impose delays proportional to the total number of lights (i.e., when all lights are red). Thus, the gating of traffic by red lights will directly correlate with the rate by which transit times increase when trips are rank-ordered from fastest to slowest—that is, the slope of latency across ranks. Similarly, to the degree that the striatum relates to gating of a particular stimulus-response mapping, striatal activation and/or corticostriatal interactions should relate to this slope estimate during conditions that put greater demands on selective output gating (e.g., CL-S). Our results show evidence consistent with the dynamics of a corticostriatal output gating mechanism for selection from within WM. Specifically, we observed (1) that demands on output gating (whether global or selective) are associated with differential recruitment of the dorsal anterior premotor cortex (PrePMd), the cortical area most strongly identified with second-order control in prior work (Koechlin et al., 2003Koechlin E.

Cortex. 2012; 22: 527-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar); (2) that coupling between PrePMd and striatum increases specifically when output gating is required; and (3) that PrePMd, the striatum, and their functional coupling correlate with separate behavioral signatures of output gating that are potentially consistent with a maintenance versus gating division of labor within this circuit. That is, PrePMd BOLD specifically and uniquely predicts mean shifts in RT during selective output gating, whereas BOLD in caudate and its coupling with PrePMd uniquely predict the slope of the RT distribution during selective output gating. The behavioral results revealed that the CL conditions were associated with characteristic performance costs distinguishing them both from the CF conditions and from costs related to WM load. Figure 2B plots the effect of experimental conditions on mean RT; similar condition effects were evident in terms of error rates although performance was satisfactory on the task overall (12% errors; Figure S1 available online). Specifically, the CL conditions yielded increased RT relative to the CF conditions overall, F(1, 21) = 250.54, p < 0.001. This difference is important, as subjects could conceivably have always waited until the final stimulus to decide which lower order item to select. To the contrary, the behavioral facilitation on CF relative to CL trials suggests that subjects took advantage of the input gating strategy available to them on CF trials and that CL trial imposed a cost associated with selection from WM. These mean RT costs were particularly evident in the CL-S condition, F(1, 21) = 6.02, p = 0.02, even when comparing this to the CF-G and CL-G conditions with equivalent WM loads (Figure 2A; t values > 4.07, and p values 9 0.001). These effects were not due to insufficient practice with each contextual token, as the differences were stable with experience (see Figures S1A–S1C). Thus, a robust performance decrement is associated with the CL-S condition relative to CF conditions and is dissociable from costs related to greater WM load. Only partial information about the nature of this difference is conveyed by mean RT. Indeed, and as implied by gating effects in our traffic analogy, separable effects of condition were evident in the RT distribution’s shape (Figure 2C; Balota and Yap, 2011Balota D.A. Yap M.J.

Sci. 2011; 20: 160-166Crossref Scopus (209) Google Scholar; see also Ratcliff and Frank, 2012Ratcliff R. Frank M.J. Reinforcement-based decision making in corticostriatal circuits: mutual constraints by neurocomputational and diffusion models.Neural Comput. 2012; 24: 1186-1229Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Relative to the CF-S condition, the greater WM load in the CF-G condition was disproportionately apparent in the tail of the RT distribution. Relative to the CF-G condition, however, the load-matched CL conditions yielded dissociable effects on the shape of the distribution. Whereas the CL-G condition increased RT equally across the entire distribution relative to CF-G—akin to a mean shift due to demand on selecting information from WM—only the CL-S condition yielded an additional elongation of the distribution. This elongation is hypothesized to relate to inefficiencies in selection from WM due to output gating (akin to the effect of traffic lights on the distribution of trip durations), an assumption we relate to fMRI data later. These changes in shape were quantified as the rate at which RTs increased across deciles of the distribution (Figure 2E, “RT Slope”). The CL-S condition yielded a larger increase in RT slope than both the CL-G and the CF-G conditions, t(21) = 6.54, p < 0.001; t(21) = 4.20, p < 0.001; and both of these differences were greater than that observed between the CL-G and CF-G conditions, t(21) = 3.24, p < 0.005; t(21) = 6.54, p < 0.001. Thus, and in contrast to the combined effect of WM load on both the mean and shape of the RT distribution, the CL conditions yielded a change in the mean of the RT distribution, with an additional elongation of the distribution only in the CL-S condition. In contrast to the mean shift evident between CF-G and CL-G, the effect of CL-S on RT slope is presumably attributable to the unique, load-independent demands on selective output gating required by this condition. Performance was comparable in the scanned version of the experiment, where we imposed a delay between the final stimulus event and the response mappings (discussed above Figure 1A). This delay was imposed to ensure that BOLD responses to stimuli appearing last were unrelated to any demands imposed by the active selection and execution of a motor response, which may involve mechanisms similar to output gating. Despite this change, accuracy remained high across all conditions (means of 90.9%–93.2%). The only reliable performance effect of condition was increased RT in the global conditions relative to both selective conditions, F(1, 21) = 22.7, p < 0.001, perhaps reflecting the increased WM load in the global conditions. See Figures S1E–S1H for behavioral results from the scanned session. Widespread regions in the PFC were recruited during task performance, both on presentation of higher-level context (red regions in Figure 3) and lower-level items (Figure 3, blue regions; overlap in purple) relative to baseline, averaging across presentation orders (first versus last). A contrast of these effects revealed that a subset of lateral frontal cortex exhibited a stronger response to context information (i.e., numbers) relative to items (i.e., letters or wingdings; black outlined regions in Figure 3). The frontal peak of this response fell within the previously identified locus of second-order control, the left dorsal pre-premotor cortex (Montreal Neurological Institute [MNI] coordinates: −50, 8, 30; Badre and D’Esposito, 2007Badre D.

Neurosci. 2007; 19: 2082-2099Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). To assess whether frontal cortex might be differentially involved in second-order control over output gating relative to input gating, we contrasted the BOLD responses to contexts appearing last versus first relative to the analogous contrast of items appearing last versus first.

Such bursts were detected in hippocampal neurons of various species, including cats (Kandel and Spencer, 1961Kandel E.R. Spencer W.A. Electrophysiology of hippocampal neurons. II.

While single APs can fail to reach connected downstream neurons, bursts are often transmitted more reliably (Izhikevich et al., 2003Izhikevich E.M. Desai N.S. Walcott E.C. Hoppensteadt F.C.

Thus, they can accelerate transmission of information (Kepecs et al., 2002Kepecs A. Wang X.J. Lisman J. Bursting neurons signal input slope.J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 9053-9062Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Remarkably, bursts are highly effective in the induction of synaptic plasticity (Paulsen and Sejnowski, 2000Paulsen O. Sejnowski T.J. Natural patterns of activity and long-term synaptic plasticity.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2000; 10: 172-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar) and in the formation of hippocampus-dependent memories (Xu et al., 2012Xu W. Morishita W. Buckmaster P.S. Pang Z.P.

Experimental evidence, obtained mostly in rats, indicates that under in vivo conditions, bursts in the hippocampus occur with a high incidence during specific behaviors, such as goal identification and approach (Ranck, 1973Ranck Jr., J.B. Studies on single neurons in dorsal hippocampal formation and septum in unrestrained rats. I. Behavioral correlates and firing repertoires.Exp.

Single-cell activity and synchronous bursting in the rat hippocampus during waking behavior and sleep.Exp. Neurol. 1985; 89: 71-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In the hippocampus, prolonged bursts of APs, referred to also as complex spike bursts (CSs), are detected during nontheta states as conditional synchrony detectors, mostly present after a period of neuronal silence (Harris et al., 2001Harris K.D.

Temporal interaction between single spikes and complex spike bursts in hippocampal pyramidal cells.Neuron. 2001; 32: 141-149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Two more recent studies demonstrated, using whole-cell recordings in head-fixed mice on a spherical treadmill or in freely moving rats exploring a maze, that hippocampal place cells exhibit spatially tuned CSs (Epsztein et al., 2011Epsztein J.

Collman F. Dombeck D.A. Tank D.W. Intracellular dynamics of hippocampal place cells during virtual navigation.Nature. 2009; 461: 941-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). The cellular mechanisms underlying bursting in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons were studied previously almost exclusively in in vitro rat brain slices. A major focus of this research was the study of intrinsic mechanisms underlying the burst-generating spike afterdepolarization (e.g., Azouz et al., 1996Azouz R. Jensen M.S. Yaari Y. Ionic basis of spike after-depolarization and burst generation in adult rat hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells.J. Physiol. 1996; 492: 211-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, Metz et al., 2005Metz A.E. Jarsky T. Martina M. Spruston N. R-type calcium channels contribute to afterdepolarization and bursting in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons.J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 5763-5773Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). This work showed that the afterdepolarization involves K+ channels (Jensen et al., 1994Jensen M.S. Azouz R. Yaari Y. Variant firing patterns in rat hippocampal pyramidal cells modulated by extracellular potassium.J. Neurophysiol. 1994; 71: 831-839PubMed Google Scholar), Na+ channels (Azouz et al., 1996Azouz R. Jensen M.S. Yaari Y. Ionic basis of spike after-depolarization and burst generation in adult rat hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells.J. Physiol. 1996; 492: 211-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), and Ca2+ channels (Metz et al., 2005Metz A.E. Jarsky T. Martina M. Spruston N. R-type calcium channels contribute to afterdepolarization and bursting in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons.J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 5763-5773Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). In line with these observations, the contribution of Ca2+ currents is augmented when K+ channels are concomitantly blocked by pharmacological means (Magee and Carruth, 1999Magee J.C. Carruth M. Dendritic voltage-gated ion channels regulate the action potential firing mode of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons.J. Neurophysiol. 1999; 82: 1895-1901Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, Sanabria et al., 2001Sanabria E.R. Su H. Yaari Y. Initiation of network bursts by Ca2+-dependent intrinsic bursting in the rat pilocarpine model of temporal lobe epilepsy.J. Physiol. 2001; 532: 205-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). The propensity for intrinsic bursting can vary between different CA1 pyramidal neurons. Thus, in addition to reliable bursters, there is also a subpopulation of “regular” spiking neurons (Jarsky et al., 2008Jarsky T. Mady R. Kennedy B. Spruston N. Distribution of bursting neurons in the CA1 region and the subiculum of the rat hippocampus.J. Comp. Neurol. 2008; 506: 535-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, Jensen et al., 1994Jensen M.S. Azouz R. Yaari Y. Variant firing patterns in rat hippocampal pyramidal cells modulated by extracellular potassium.J. Neurophysiol. 1994; 71: 831-839PubMed Google Scholar) and there is evidence that regular spiking and bursting CA1 neurons have distinct morphological features (Graves et al., 2012Graves A.R. Moore S.J. Bloss E.B. Mensh B.D. Kath W.L. Spruston N. Hippocampal pyramidal neurons comprise two distinct cell types that are countermodulated by metabotropic receptors.Neuron. 2012; 76: 776-789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Furthermore, theta-like repeated coincident stimulation of Schaffer collaterals (from the CA3 region) and the perforant path (from the entorhinal cortex) can produce plateau potentials in disinhibited hippocampal slices (Takahashi and Magee, 2009Takahashi H. Magee J.C. Pathway interactions and synaptic plasticity in the dendritic tuft regions of CA1 pyramidal neurons.Neuron. 2009; 62: 102-111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). These plateau potentials, which are initiated in the apical trunk and tuft region, can produce dendritically initiated APs. At present, it is unclear how plateau potential-mediated bursting relates to the CSs observed in vivo, as these are clearly detectable during nontheta states (Harris et al., 2001Harris K.D. Hirase H. Leinekugel X. Henze D.A. Buzsáki G. Temporal interaction between single spikes and complex spike bursts in hippocampal pyramidal cells.Neuron. 2001; 32: 141-149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). This may indicate that additional or perhaps different synaptic mechanisms can drive spontaneous bursting in the intact hippocampus. Here, we devised an approach to investigate the cellular mechanisms underlying CSs in mouse CA1 pyramidal neurons in vivo. For this purpose, we combined whole-cell recordings and two-photon dendritic Ca2+ imaging with various intra- and extracellular pharmacological manipulations. Our results demonstrate that CS firing in vivo is a feature that is in principle shared by all CA1 pyramidal neurons and that it requires N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-dependent synaptic transmission. We provide evidence that CSs require the activation of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels. The dendritic two-photon imaging experiments demonstrate large and widespread Ca2+ transients throughout basal and apical dendrites. Thus, our results identify NMDA receptor-dependent dendritic Ca2+ spikes as essential determinants for CS generation in CA1 pyramidal neurons in vivo. Targeted in vivo whole-cell recordings of mouse hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons were obtained by applying the “shadow patching” approach (Kitamura et al., 2008Kitamura K. Judkewitz B. Kano M. Denk W. Häusser M. Targeted patch-clamp recordings and single-cell electroporation of unlabeled neurons in vivo.Nat. Methods. 2008; 5: 61-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Direct visualization of the hippocampal neurons by means of two-photon imaging (Figure 1A; see Experimental Procedures) required the removal of a small portion (1–1.5 mm diameter) of the cortical tissue covering the hippocampus (Busche et al., 2012Busche M.A. Chen X. Henning H.A. Reichwald J. Staufenbiel M. Sakmann B. Konnerth A. Critical role of soluble amyloid-β for early hippocampal hyperactivity in a mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

High-resolution in vivo imaging of hippocampal dendrites and spines.J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 3147-3151Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Figure 1B shows that under these conditions the electrical activity consisted of standard APs and characteristically shaped bursts of APs, which we refer to as CSs (Buzsáki et al., 1996Buzsáki G. Penttonen M. Nádasdy Z. Bragin A. Pattern and inhibition-dependent invasion of pyramidal cell dendrites by fast spikes in the hippocampus in vivo.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1996; 93: 9921-9925Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). This pattern was similar to what has been found in the intact brain (Buzsáki et al., 1996Buzsáki G. Penttonen M. Nádasdy Z. Bragin A. Pattern and inhibition-dependent invasion of pyramidal cell dendrites by fast spikes in the hippocampus in vivo.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Collman F. Dombeck D.A. Tank D.W. Intracellular dynamics of hippocampal place cells during virtual navigation.Nature. 2009; 461: 941-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). Our results are not surprising in view of recent work (Dombeck et al., 2010Dombeck D.A. Harvey C.D. Tian L. Looger L.L. Tank D.W. Functional imaging of hippocampal place cells at cellular resolution during virtual navigation.Nat. Neurosci. 2010; 13: 1433-1440Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar) that reported unaltered hippocampal dynamics and place cell properties in awake mice with even larger cortical windows (2.7–2.8 mm diameter). Furthermore, the overall firing rate was 0.6 ± 0.11 Hz (mean ± SEM, n = 29 neurons) and, thus, similar to what has been found in intact brains of anesthetized mice (Hahn et al., 2007Hahn T.T. Sakmann B. Mehta M.R. Differential responses of hippocampal subfields to cortical up-down states.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2007; 104: 5169-5174Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Similarly, the fraction of bursts (Figure S1A available online) was comparable to that observed in rats during slow-wave sleep (Mizuseki and Buzsáki, 2013Mizuseki K. Buzsáki G. Preconfigured, skewed distribution of firing rates in the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex.Cell Rep. 2013; 4: 1010-1021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Under our experimental conditions, CSs consisted of high-frequency trains (100–250 Hz) of mostly four to five APs of decreasing amplitude that were riding on a large depolarizing envelope or “wave.” Figure 1C illustrates such a CS, in which the depolarizing wave (blue trace) had an amplitude of 35 mV and lasted at half-maximal amplitude for 27 ms. On average (n = 993 CSs from 30 neurons), the half-max duration of the depolarizing waves was 25 ± 7 ms and the amplitude was 31 ± 7 mV (mean ± SD) (Figure 1D). At resting potential (zero current through the patch pipette), CSs were observed in 73% of all the recorded neurons (Figure 1E). Overall, we conclude that our preparation is well suited for a detailed analysis of CSs, including two-photon Ca2+ imaging in combination with whole-cell recordings. Figures 1F–1H illustrate an example of such recordings, demonstrating that both single APs and CSs produced Ca2+ transients that invaded virtually all branches within the dendritic field. However, the CS-associated dendritic Ca2+ signals in the basal and proximal apical dendrites were clearly larger than those encountered with single APs (Figures 1G and 1H) as well as AP number-matched trains with similar AP frequency (Figure S1B). A distinct feature of CSs, which was not anticipated by previous in vitro work but consistent with earlier extracellular in vivo recordings (Harris et al., 2001Harris K.D. Hirase H. Leinekugel X. Henze D.A. Buzsáki G. Temporal interaction between single spikes and complex spike bursts in hippocampal pyramidal cells.Neuron. 2001; 32: 141-149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar), was the observation that their frequency increased strongly with depolarization. In the example illustrated in Figures 2A1–2A3 , the depolarization of the baseline voltage from −59 mV to −50 mV caused a more than 4-fold increase in CS frequency (Figure 2C). Interestingly, apparent nonbursters, which are neurons that did not fire CSs at resting potential, started to burst as soon as these neurons were depolarized above −58/−60 mV by current injection through the patch pipette (Figures 2B1–2B3). Above this “bursting threshold,” both bursters and nonbursters exhibited a similarly steep dependence of the CS frequency on the membrane voltage (Figures 2C and 2D; Figure S2A). This voltage dependence was observed in 31/31 tested neurons (Figure 2E, n = 8 were nonbursters at rest). Similarly, in all neurons tested (n = 7), brief depolarizing current injections (50 ms, 150 pA) could induce CSs with a probability of approximately 50% (Figure S2C). Together, these experiments demonstrate that CSs can be evoked in all CA1 hippocampal neurons in vivo and that voltage-dependent processes contribute, at least partially, to CS generation. Spontaneous firing of CA1 pyramidal neurons in vivo, including CSs, is completely blocked by the combined application of the α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptor antagonist CNQX and the NMDA receptor antagonist APV (Busche et al., 2012Busche M.A. Chen X. Henning H.A. Reichwald J. Staufenbiel M. Sakmann B. Konnerth A. Critical role of soluble amyloid-β for early hippocampal hyperactivity in a mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2012; 109: 8740-8745Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). Figures 3A–3D show that the intracellular application of MK-801, a use-dependent antagonist of NMDA receptors that works also from the inside, blocked CSs while AP firing persisted at a lower frequency (see also Figure S2C). This result demonstrates the synaptic origin of CSs and the critical role of NMDA receptors in their generation. In order to characterize the synaptic depolarization underlying CS firing, we blocked APs intracellularly by using QX-314 (Kamondi et al., 1998bKamondi A. Acsády L. Wang X.J. Buzsáki G. Theta oscillations in somata and dendrites of hippocampal pyramidal cells in vivo: activity-dependent phase-precession of action potentials.Hippocampus. 1998; 8: 244-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar, Strichartz, 1973Strichartz G.R. The inhibition of sodium currents in myelinated nerve by quaternary derivatives of lidocaine.J. Gen. Physiol. 1973; 62: 37-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). In these conditions, we observed slow spike-like potentials (Figures 3E–3J). These slow spikes were in many ways similar to the CS-associated depolarizing waves (Figure 3H). Thus, the slow spike frequency was similarly dependent on the membrane potential (Figures 3F and 3G; Figure S2B), the time courses and amplitudes were similar (Figures 3I and 3J), and, as in the case of CSs (Figure 2E), they were a common feature of all neurons (18/18; Figure S3A1). As expected, the NMDA antagonists APV (Figures 3K and 3L) and MK-801 (Figure S3A2) effectively suppressed the slow spikes. To exclude that the slow spikes were just an artifact produced by the intracellular use of QX-314, we inactivated APs by a sustained increase of the baseline membrane potential to about −35 mV. In these conditions, in the absence of any pharmacological treatment, we also recorded slow spikes that were similar to the CS-associated depolarizing waves (Figure S3B). Together, these results identify the slow spikes as critical determinants of CS firing in vivo. Next, we used two-photon imaging to study the dendritic Ca2+ signals associated with the slow spikes. As CSs, slow spikes were associated with large Ca2+ transients in basal (Figures 4A1–4A3 ) and proximal apical dendrites (Figures S4A and S4C), as well as in the somata (Figures S4B and S4D). In addition, we identified smaller-amplitude Ca2+ transients in highly confined dendritic hot spots (Figures 4A1–4A3 and S4A), representing presumably asynchronous synaptic input sites (Jia et al., 2010Jia H. Rochefort N.L. Chen X. Konnerth A. Dendritic organization of sensory input to cortical neurons in vivo.Nature. 2010; 464: 1307-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). Importantly, the slow spike-associated large dendritic, but not the hot spot, Ca2+ transients were abolished by D-890 (Figures 4B1–4B3), an intracellular broad-range antagonist of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels in hippocampal (Conti and Lisman, 2002Conti R.

NMDA spikes in basal dendrites of cortical pyramidal neurons.Nature. 2000; 404: 285-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). In parallel to the large dendritic Ca2+ transients, the slow spikes were also abolished by D-890 (Figures 4C–4E). Due to the limited access of functional two-photon Ca2+ imaging, we were not able to determine whether the asynchronous hot spot Ca2+ signals represented local dendritic spikes (Schiller et al., 2000Schiller J. Major G. Koester H.J. Schiller Y. NMDA spikes in basal dendrites of cortical pyramidal neurons.Nature. 2000; 404: 285-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar) or single spine responses (Chen et al., 2011Chen X. Leischner U. Rochefort N.L. Nelken I. Konnerth A. Functional mapping of single spines in cortical neurons in vivo.Nature. 2011; 475: 501-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). In line with the NMDA receptor sensitivity of the CSs (Figures 3A–3D; Figure S2C) and of that of synaptic input sites (Jia et al., 2010Jia H. Rochefort N.L. Chen X. Konnerth A. Dendritic organization of sensory input to cortical neurons in vivo.Nature. 2010; 464: 1307-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar), we found that APV blocked effectively both the large dendritic as well as the hot spot Ca2+ transients (Figures 4F and 4G). The large dendritic Ca2+ transients were never observed in isolation in single dendritic branches. Instead, they were reliably detected in all branches within the field of view (Figures 4H and 4I) and corresponded strictly with all slow spikes, without failures in all 14/14 neurons tested. Our results provide critical mechanistic insights into the generation of CSs in CA1 pyramidal neurons in vivo. By combining targeted whole-cell recordings, two-photon imaging of dendritic Ca2+ signals, and pharmacological manipulations in vivo, we show that CSs can occur in all CA1 pyramidal neurons, provided that they are sufficiently depolarized. CSs are induced by synaptic excitation and require the combined activation of NMDA receptors and voltage-gated Ca2+ channels, which together produce a nonlinear regenerative spike-like response engaging basal and apical dendrites. While previous in vitro work has focused on the role of intrinsic membrane properties for burst firing (Azouz et al., 1996Azouz R. Jensen M.S. Yaari Y.

Neurosci. 2005; 25: 5763-5773Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), we now establish that in vivo CSs have in addition a pronounced synaptic component (see also Abraham and Kairiss, 1988Abraham W.C.

Differential effects of phencyclidine upon hippocampal complex-spike and theta neurons.Neurosci. Lett. 1984; 45: 141-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). This may explain why CSs in vivo consist typically of five, and sometimes even more, APs rather than the usual two APs detected in the subset of bursting CA1 pyramidal neurons in vitro. Since these are the first dendritic Ca2+ recordings in CA1 pyramidal neurons in vivo, we would like to mention several technical considerations that are relevant for such experiments. First, the surgical removal of a small portion of cortical tissue is a possible point of concern for the study of cognitive processes. However, on the cellular level, the basic patterns of hippocampal activity are highly similar in intact brains (Harvey et al., 2009Harvey C.D. Collman F. Dombeck D.A. Tank D.W.

For example, there is a close similarity of CS frequencies in both preparations (Hahn et al., 2007Hahn T.T. Sakmann B. Mehta M.R. Differential responses of hippocampal subfields to cortical up-down states.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2007; 104: 5169-5174Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Furthermore, even theta oscillations and place cell activity, requiring an intact hippocampal circuitry, were not affected by such cortical windows (Dombeck et al., 2010Dombeck D.A. Harvey C.D.

Neurosci. 2010; 13: 1433-1440Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). Second, the mechanical stabilization of the hippocampal tissue with agarose was an essential factor for good dendritic Ca2+ recordings in hippocampal neurons. Third, as for dendritic recordings in cortical neurons (Chen et al., 2011Chen X. Leischner U. Rochefort N.L. Nelken I. Konnerth A.

https://openalex.org/W2067925445,"Transcription factors mediate gene regulation by site-specific binding to chromosomal operators. It is commonly assumed that the level of repression is determined solely by the equilibrium binding of a repressor to its operator. However, this assumption has not been possible to test in living cells. Here we have developed a single-molecule chase assay to measure how long an individual transcription factor molecule remains bound at a specific chromosomal operator site. We find that the lac repressor dimer stays bound on average 5 min at the native lac operator in Escherichia coli and that a stronger operator results in a slower dissociation rate but a similar association rate. Our findings do not support the simple equilibrium model. The discrepancy with this model can, for example, be accounted for by considering that transcription initiation drives the system out of equilibrium. Such effects need to be considered when predicting gene activity from transcription factor binding strengths."

These newly generated neurons immediately move to the intermediate zone (IZ), where they become multipolar cells with multiple immature neurite extensions (Barnes and Polleux, 2009Barnes A.P.

Subsequently, the neurons initiate leading and trailing processes (nascent axons) and eventually transform into bipolar cells (Hatanaka and Yamauchi, 2013Hatanaka Y. Yamauchi K.

Signal. 2011; 4: ra76Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The bipolar cells are fully polarized and migrate toward the cortical plate (CP). The IZ is divided into two parts, the upper radial migration zone and the lower multipolar migration zone (Jossin and Cooper, 2011Jossin Y. Cooper J.A. Reelin, Rap1 and N-cadherin orient the migration of multipolar neurons in the developing neocortex.Nat. Neurosci. 2011; 14: 697-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). The majority of cells in the radial migration zone are bipolar cells, and those in the multipolar migration zone are multipolar cells; therefore, the multipolar-to-bipolar transition might occur at the border between the multipolar and radial migration zones and/or within the multipolar migration zone in the lower part of the IZ. Although environmental cues are required for unpolarized neurons to establish polarity and elongate axons (Zolessi et al., 2006Zolessi F.R. Poggi L. Wilkinson C.J. Chien C.B. Harris W.A. Polarization and orientation of retinal ganglion cells in vivo.Neural Dev. 2006; 1: 2Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), the extracellular cues that exist in the lower IZ and how these cues regulate the neuronal polarization (multipolar-to-bipolar transition and axon formation) have not been determined. Here, we show that multipolar cells closely interact with the preexisting axons of early-born neurons, and this interaction is important for neuronal polarization. In addition, the TAG-1 knockdown in multipolar cells impairs neuronal polarization. Our results suggest that the TAG-1-dependent interaction between multipolar cells and preexisting axons enables multipolar cells to specify axons and develop into bipolar cells. Newly generated neurons in the embryonic cerebral cortex establish their polarity during the multipolar-to-bipolar cell transition (Calderon de Anda et al., 2008Calderon de Anda F. Gärtner A.

Neurosci. 2008; 28: 5710-5720Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), during which neurons extend leading (future dendrite) and trailing (nascent axon) processes (Hatanaka and Yamauchi, 2013Hatanaka Y.

Cortex. 2013; 23: 105-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). To precisely analyze neuronal polarization in vivo, we first examined the temporal regulation of neuronal polarization in cultured slices using time-lapse imaging (Figure 1A; Movie S1 available online). To visualize individual multipolar cells, we transfected Tα-Cre and Tα-LPL-LynEGFP into progenitor cells at E13 using in utero electroporation, and we sacrificed the embryos at E15 for time-lapse imaging as described previously (Nakamuta et al., 2011Nakamuta S. Funahashi Y. Namba T. Arimura N. Picciotto M.R. Tokumitsu H. Soderling T.R. Sakakibara A. Miyata T. Kamiguchi H. Kaibuchi K. Local application of neurotrophins specifies axons through inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, calcium, and Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases.Sci. Signal. 2011; 4: ra76Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Using this system, we observed cells that expressed membrane-targeted EGFP (LynEGFP) under the control of the Tα neuron-specific promoter and Cre recombinase. The multipolar cells in the IZ repeatedly extended and retracted neurites during the multipolar-to-bipolar transition (Figure 1B). The majority of the multipolar cells extended trailing processes (nascent axons) prior to leading processes (60.0%, n = 80 cells; Figure 1C), which suggests that the multipolar cells initially form axons and then undergo multipolar-to-bipolar transition. Therefore, the first step of neuronal polarization in vivo is axon formation, which is the same as that in dissociated neurons (Dotti et al., 1988Dotti C.G. Sullivan C.A. Banker G.A.

In the following experiment, we focused on axon formation to study neuronal polarization. Notably, the length of the minor process did not exceed 50 μm (Figure 1D). Next, we analyzed the spatial regulation of neuronal polarization. Previous studies have suggested that neuronal polarization occurs in the IZ (Hatanaka and Yamauchi, 2013Hatanaka Y. Yamauchi K.

Signal. 2011; 4: ra76Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar); therefore, we focused our analysis on this region. The IZ is primarily defined on the basis of its architecture and running efferent and afferent axons. Both efferent and afferent axons, which were labeled with anti-neurofilament antibody (SMI-312), were observed throughout the IZ (Figure 1E). In contrast, the expression of TAG-1, an efferent axon marker, was primarily restricted to the lower section of the IZ (Figure 1E), as described in previous studies (Fukuda et al., 1997Fukuda T. Kawano H. Ohyama K. Li H.P. Takeda Y. Oohira A. Kawamura K. Immunohistochemical localization of neurocan and L1 in the formation of thalamocortical pathway of developing rats.J. Comp.

Distinct roles of neuropilin 1 signaling for radial and tangential extension of callosal axons.J. Comp. Neurol. 2009; 514: 215-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Thus, the IZ was divided into two distinct regions: a TAG-1-negative upper region (IZ-U) and a TAG-1-positive lower region (IZ-L) (Figure 1E). To analyze neuronal polarization in fixed brain slices, we categorized the newly generated neurons in the IZ based on their morphology as follows: multipolar cells without axons, multipolar cells with axons, bipolar cells without axons, or bipolar cells with axons (Figure 1F). Multipolar cells without axons are considered unpolarized cells, and multipolar cells with axons and bipolar cells with or without axons are polarized cells. The time-lapse imaging showed that processes greater than 50 μm in length should be defined as axons, because almost all of the neurites that exceeded 50 μm in length developed into axons, and the length of the minor processes did not exceed 50 μm (Figures 1B and 1D). We electroporated at E13 and fixed the mice for immunohistochemistry at E15. In the VZ and SVZ, almost all of the GFP-labeled cells were multipolar cells without axons (Figure 1G). There were no cells with extended axons in the VZ/SVZ. In contrast, more than 70% of the GFP-labeled cells in the IZ-L possessed axons (n = 112 cells from four embryos). Half of these axon-extending cells were multipolar cells with axons. The remaining GFP-labeled cells in the IZ-L were multipolar cells without axons. In the IZ-U, most of the GFP-labeled cells were bipolar cells with axons. The population of bipolar cells without axons was extremely small throughout each layer. Taken together, these results raise the possibility that neuronal polarization (axon formation and the multipolar-to-bipolar transition) primarily occurs in the IZ-L. The majority of multipolar cells extend their axons tangentially in the IZ; however, the initial orientation of the axons varies between studies (de Anda et al., 2010de Anda F.C. Meletis K. Ge X.

Dynamics of centrosome translocation and microtubule organization in neocortical neurons during distinct modes of polarization.Cereb. Cortex. 2013; Google Scholar). We therefore quantified the initial orientation of the axons using time-lapse imaging analysis. As shown in Figures 1A, 2A and 6C, the nascent axons originated from a variety of angles at the initial phase of axon formation (Figure S1). This result suggests that the nascent axon was generated not only parallel to but also perpendicular to the tangential axis. However, regardless of the initial orientation of the axon, almost all of the nascent axons possessed the “immobile region,” in which axons remained in the same area (inset in Figure 2A; Movie S2). Given that there are many tangentially oriented axons of early-born neurons in the IZ (Del Río et al., 2000Del Río J.A. Martínez A. Auladell C. Soriano E. Developmental history of the subplate and developing white matter in the murine neocortex. Neuronal organization and relationship with the main afferent systems at embryonic and perinatal stages.Cereb. Cortex. 2000; 10: 784-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), we speculated that the nascent axons of multipolar cells interact with preexisting axons and that this interaction results in immobility. We therefore examined the interactions between TAG-1- and SMI-312-positive axons and nascent axons of multipolar cells. Most of the nascent axons of the multipolar cells closely contacted TAG-1- or SMI-312-positive fibers (86.1% ± 3.5% or 88.8% ± 4.3%, respectively) (Figures 2B and 2C). In addition, the immunoelectron microscopic analysis revealed that the tangential processes of the multipolar cells closely contacted axon-like processes (Figure 2D). Furthermore, scanning electron microscopic analysis showed that the tangentially oriented processes of multipolar cells twined around the axon bundle in the IZ (Figure S2). To determine whether the preexisting axons were derived from early-born neurons, we performed a double electroporation analysis. The early-born neurons were labeled with EGFP in the first electroporation, and the late-born multipolar cells were labeled with Kusabira Orange in the second electroporation; both cell types were analyzed 2 days after the second electroporation. The 3D reconstruction analysis showed that the nascent axons of the Kusabira-Orange-labeled multipolar cells closely contacted the axons of the GFP-labeled early-born neurons (Figures 2E and 2F; Movie S3). These results raise the possibility that the interaction between the neurites of multipolar cells and the axons of early-born neurons stimulates the neuronal polarization of multipolar cells. To examine whether the axon-multipolar cell interaction stimulates neuronal polarization, we conducted overlay cultures (Wang and Marquardt, 2012Wang L. Marquardt T. Direct live monitoring of heterotypic axon-axon interactions in vitro.Nat. Protoc. 2012; 7: 351-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) (Figure 3A). Dissociated cortical neurons from a wild-type mouse were plated at low density (first neurons). These neurons formed axons within 3 days. The first neurons were overlaid with newly dissociated cortical neurons (second neurons) prepared from a ROSA26-LynVenus mouse (Abe et al., 2011Abe T. Kiyonari H. Shioi G. Inoue K. Nakao K. Aizawa S. Fujimori T. Establishment of conditional reporter mouse lines at ROSA26 locus for live cell imaging.Genesis. 2011; 49: 579-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) and were cultured for 3 days. For the quantitative analysis of axon-neurite interactions, the angles between the preexisting axons and the neurites of unpolarized cells were characterized as described previously (Bagnard et al., 2001Bagnard D. Chounlamountri N. Püschel A.W. Bolz J. Axonal surface molecules act in combination with semaphorin 3a during the establishment of corticothalamic projections.Cereb. Cortex. 2001; 11: 278-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). If the second neurons formed axons through interactions with preexisting axons (axons of the first neurons), then the angle between the two axons was nearly parallel (Figure 3A). If the second neurons formed axons independently from preexisting axons, then the angle between the two axons was nearly perpendicular (Figure 3A). Most of the LynVenus-expressing second neurons formed axons at angles of 0° to 30° (86.6% ± 2.5%) (Figure 3B and 3C), suggesting that the second neurons formed axons through interactions with the preexisting axons. To examine the causal relationships between axon formation and preexisting axons, we observed the interactions using time-lapse imaging (Figure 3D; Movie S4). Most of the second neurons contacted preexisting axons before axon formation. In most cases, the axons emerged from the contacted site and elongated while in contact with the preexisting axons (89.8%; n = 49 cells). Next, we performed double electroporation analysis to analyze the interaction between the multipolar cells and preexisting axons in vivo. The preexisting axons of the early-born neurons were labeled with EGFP in the first electroporation, and the late-born neurons were labeled with Kusabira Orange in the second electroporation. Two days after the second electroporation, the interactions were analyzed using dual-color time-lapse imaging. The neurites of late-born neurons maintained contact with EGFP-labeled axons during their polarization (Figures 3E and 3F; Movie S5). In most cases, the contacting neurites eventually developed into nascent axons (6/8 cases). To rule out the possibility that other cell-cell interactions regulate neuronal polarization, we cocultured neurons with nestin-positive cells and analyzed the role of the nestin-positive cells in neuronal polarization. The nestin-positive cells dissociated from embryonic mouse neocortex were overlaid with newly dissociated cortical neurons and were cultured for 2 days. More than half of neurons extended axons away from the nestin-positive cells (58.1%; n = 43 cells) (Figure S3). Another half of the neurons extended axons toward the nestin-positive cells (41.9%; n = 43 cells) (Figure S3). These results indicate that the interaction between neurons and nestin-positive cells is not involved in the neuronal polarization. Thus, it is likely that the interaction between unpolarized neurons and pioneering neurons, rather than the interaction between neurons and nestin-positive cells, is important for neuronal polarization. Axon-axon interactions are primarily mediated through immunoglobulin superfamily cell adhesion molecules (IgCAMs) (Panicker et al., 2003Panicker A.K. Buhusi M. Thelen K. Maness P.F. Cellular signalling mechanisms of neural cell adhesion molecules.Front.Biosci. 2003; 8: d900-d911Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); thus, we hypothesized that IgCAMs are involved in the interaction between the neurites of multipolar cells and the axons of early-born neurons and that these interactions regulate neuronal polarization. To analyze the expression of IgCAMs in the multipolar cells, the EGFP-labeled multipolar cells at E14 were harvested using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) when almost all of the electroporated cells exhibited the features of multipolar cells (Nakamuta et al., 2011Nakamuta S.

We show that serotonergic (5HT) axons originating from a small group of neurons in the raphe form an extensive plexus on most of the ventricular walls. Electron microscopy revealed intimate contacts between 5HT axons and NSCs (B1) or ependymal cells (E1) and these cells were labeled by a transsynaptic viral tracer injected into the raphe. B1 cells express the 5HT receptors 2C and 5A. Electrophysiology showed that activation of these receptors in B1 cells induced small inward currents. Intraventricular infusion of 5HT2C agonist or antagonist increased or decreased V-SVZ proliferation, respectively. These results indicate that supraependymal 5HT axons directly interact with NSCs to regulate neurogenesis via 5HT2C."

Recently, it was shown that zinc could compromise manganese uptake and that zinc levels increased during infection by S. pneumoniae in all the niches that it colonized. Here we show, by quantitative means, that extracellular zinc acts in a dose dependent manner to competitively inhibit manganese uptake by S. pneumoniae, with an EC50 of 30.2 µM for zinc in cation-defined media. By exploiting the ability to directly manipulate S. pneumoniae accumulation of manganese, we analyzed the connection between manganese and superoxide dismutase (SodA), a primary source of protection for S. pneumoniae against oxidative stress. We show that manganese starvation led to a decrease in sodA transcription indicating that expression of sodA was regulated through an unknown manganese responsive pathway. Intriguingly, examination of recombinant SodA revealed that the enzyme was potentially a cambialistic superoxide dismutase with an iron/manganese cofactor. SodA was also shown to provide the majority of protection against oxidative stress as a S. pneumoniae ΔsodA mutant strain was found to be hypersensitive to oxidative stress, despite having wild-type manganese levels, indicating that the metal ion alone was not sufficiently protective. Collectively, these results provide a quantitative assessment of the competitive effect of zinc upon manganese uptake and provide a molecular basis for how extracellular zinc exerts a ‘toxic’ effect on bacterial pathogens, such as S. pneumoniae."

However, the molecular mechanisms that coordinate activity-induced modifications in cadherin localization and adhesion and the subsequent changes in synapse morphology and efficacy remain unknown. We demonstrate that the intracellular cadherin binding protein δ-catenin is transiently palmitoylated by DHHC5 after enhanced synaptic activity and that palmitoylation increases δ-catenin-cadherin interactions at synapses. Both the palmitoylation of δ-catenin and its binding to cadherin are required for activity-induced stabilization of N-cadherin at synapses and the enlargement of postsynaptic spines, as well as the insertion of GluA1 and GluA2 subunits into the synaptic membrane and the concomitant increase in miniature excitatory postsynaptic current amplitude. Notably, context-dependent fear conditioning in mice resulted in increased δ-catenin palmitoylation, as well as increased δ-catenin-cadherin associations at hippocampal synapses. Together these findings suggest a role for palmitoylated δ-catenin in coordinating activity-dependent changes in synaptic adhesion molecules, synapse structure and receptor localization that are involved in memory formation."
https://openalex.org/W2083844864,"In this study, the authors show that there are multiple forms of opioid-induced long-term depression (OP-LTD) in the dorsal striatum, each mediated by the mu, delta or kappa opioid receptor. The mu and delta OP-LTD are presynaptic and can summate, but only mu OP-LTD occludes endocannabinoid-induced LTD. Furthermore, mu OP-LTP, but not kappa or delta OP-LTP, is blocked by the analgesic oxycodone. As prescription opioid analgesic abuse rates rise, so does the need to understand the long-term effects of opioid exposure on brain function. The dorsal striatum is an important site for drug-induced neuronal plasticity. We found that exogenously applied and endogenously released opioids induced long-term depression (OP-LTD) of excitatory inputs to the dorsal striatum in mice and rats. Mu and delta OP-LTD, although both being presynaptically expressed, were dissociable in that they summated, differentially occluded endocannabinoid-LTD and inhibited different striatal inputs. Kappa OP-LTD showed a unique subregional expression in striatum. A single in vivo exposure to the opioid analgesic oxycodone disrupted mu OP-LTD and endocannabinoid-LTD, but not delta or kappa OP-LTD. These data reveal previously unknown opioid-mediated forms of long-term striatal plasticity that are differentially affected by opioid analgesic exposure and are likely important mediators of striatum-dependent learning and behavior."

Both networks contain clustered motifs and show specific overlap between them. Chemical connections exhibit a preference for transitive patterns, such as feedforward triplet motifs. This structured connectivity is supported by a characteristic spatial organization: transitivity of chemical connectivity is directed vertically in the sagittal plane, and electrical synapses appear strictly confined to the sagittal plane. The specific, highly structured connectivity rules suggest that these motifs are essential for the function of the cerebellar network."

NHPs were fed a WSD (36% fat) supplemented with 0.37% resveratrol throughout pregnancy. Outcomes were compared with cohorts fed WSD alone and control chow (14% fat) to distinguish between WSD and resveratrol-specific effects in these animals. In the early third trimester, uterine blood flow was measured by Doppler ultrasound before fetal delivery and tissue collection. Resveratrol resulted in 30% maternal weight loss and improved glucose tolerance, increased uterine artery volume blood flow, and decreased placental inflammation and liver triglyceride deposition. In addition, fetal pancreatic mass was enlarged by 42%, with a 12-fold increase in proliferation by Ki67 immunohistochemistry. These results demonstrate that resveratrol use during pregnancy yields improvements in maternal and placental phenotype with beneficial effects in the fetal liver but an unexplained and concerning alteration in fetal pancreatic development, which strongly cautions against the use of resveratrol by pregnant women."

Here, we show that ANG expression in human tissues is strongly correlated with an invasive cancer phenotype. We also show that ANG induces cellular survival, proliferation, endothelial tube formation and xenograft angiogenesis and growth. Novel mechanistic investigations revealed that ANG expression stimulated matrix metallopeptidase-2 (MMP2) expression through the phosphorylation of ERK1/2. Targeting ANG in vivo with N65828, a small-molecule inhibitor of the ribonucleolytic activity of human ANG, resulted in the diminution of xenograft tumoral growth through the inhibition of angiogenesis.

https://openalex.org/W2061380383,"Energy sensing by the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is of fundamental importance in cell biology. In the pancreatic β-cell, AMPK is a central regulator of insulin secretion. The capacity of the β-cell to increase insulin output is a critical compensatory mechanism in prediabetes, yet its molecular underpinnings are unclear. Here we delineate a complex consisting of the AMPK-related kinase SIK2, the CDK5 activator CDK5R1 (also known as p35) and the E3 ligase PJA2 essential for β-cell functional compensation. Following glucose stimulation, SIK2 phosphorylates p35 at Ser 91, to trigger its ubiquitylation by PJA2 and promote insulin secretion. Furthermore, SIK2 accumulates in β-cells in models of metabolic syndrome to permit compensatory secretion; in contrast, β-cell knockout of SIK2 leads to accumulation of p35 and impaired secretion. This work demonstrates that the SIK2-p35-PJA2 complex is essential for glucose homeostasis and provides a link between p35-CDK5 and the AMPK family in excitable cells."
https://openalex.org/W2009094782,"A tethered ligand approach reveals that four ligand molecules are required for full desensitization of tetrameric iGluR (glutamate receptor) channels. When fewer ligands are bound, which might be the case during synaptic transmission, desensitization is incomplete or non-existent. Cell signaling is often mediated by the binding of multiple ligands to multisubunit receptors. The probabilistic nature and sometimes slow rate of binding encountered with diffusible ligands can impede attempts to determine how the ligand occupancy controls signaling in such protein complexes. We describe a solution to this problem that uses a photoswitched tethered ligand as a 'ligand clamp' to induce rapid and stable binding and unbinding at defined subsets of subunits. We applied the approach to study gating in ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGluRs), ligand-gated ion channels that mediate excitatory neurotransmission and plasticity at glutamatergic synapses in the brain. We probed gating in two kainate-type iGluRs, GluK2 homotetramers and GluK2–GluK5 heterotetramers. Ultrafast (submillisecond) photoswitching of an azobenzene-based ligand on specific subunits provided a real-time measure of gating and revealed that partially occupied receptors can activate without desensitizing. The findings have implications for signaling by locally released and spillover glutamate."

To explore how the thalamus transforms the retinal image, we built a model of the retinothalamic circuit using experimental data and simple wiring rules. The model shows how the thalamus might form a resampled map of visual space with the potential to facilitate detection of stimulus position in the presence of sensor noise. Bayesian decoding conducted with the model provides support for this scenario. Despite its benefits, however, resampling introduces image blur, thus impairing edge perception. Whole-cell recordings obtained in vivo suggest that this problem is mitigated by arrangements of excitation and inhibition within the receptive field that effectively boost contrast borders, much like strategies used in digital image processing."

The signal transduction mechanism subserving odorant receptor gene silencing remains obscure, however. Here, we demonstrate in the zebrafish that odorant receptor gene silencing is dependent on receptor activity. Moreover, we show that signaling through G protein βγ subunits is both necessary and sufficient to suppress the expression of odorant receptor genes and likely acts through histone methylation to maintain the silenced odorant receptor genes in transcriptionally inactive heterochromatin. These results link receptor activity with the epigenetic mechanisms responsible for ensuring the expression of one odorant receptor per olfactory sensory neuron."

This is partly because the molecules and the molecular mechanisms that contribute to PDAC are not well understood. Our goal is to understand the role of p21-activated kinase 1 (Pak1) signaling axis in the progression of PDAC. Pak1, a serine/threonine kinase, is a well-known regulator of cytoskeletal remodeling, cell motility, cell proliferation and cell survival. Recent reports suggest that Pak1 by itself can have an oncogenic role in a wide variety of cancers. In this study, we analyzed the expression of Pak1 in human pancreatic cancer tissues and found that Pak1 levels are significantly upregulated in PDAC samples as compared with adjacent normals. Further, to study the functional role of Pak1 in pancreatic cancer model systems, we developed stable overexpression and lentiviral short hairpin RNA-mediated knockdown (KD) clones of Pak1 and studied the changes in transforming properties of the cells. We also observed that Pak1 KD clones failed to form tumors in nude mice. By adopting a quantitative PCR array-based approach, we identified fibronectin, a component of the extracellular matrix and a mesenchymal marker, as a transcriptional target of Pak1 signaling. The underlying molecular mechanism of Pak1-mediated transformation includes its nuclear import and recruitment to the fibronectin promoter via interaction with nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB)-p65 complex. To our knowledge, this is the first study illustrating Pak1-NF-κB-p65-mediated fibronectin regulation as a potent tumor-promoting mechanism in KRAS intact model."
https://openalex.org/W1973303450,"In the process of mate selection by female songbirds, male suitors advertise their quality through reproductive displays in which song plays an important role. Females evaluate the quality of each signal and the associated male, and the results of that evaluation guide expression of selective courtship displays. Some studies reveal broad agreement among females in their preferences for specific signal characteristics, indicating that those features are especially salient in female mate choice. Other studies reveal that females differ in their preference for specific characteristics, indicating that in those cases female evaluation of signal quality is influenced by factors other than simply the physical properties of the signal. Thus, both the physical properties of male signals and specific traits of female signal evaluation can impact female mate choice. Here, we characterized the mate preferences of female Bengalese finches. We found that calls and copulation solicitation displays are equally reliable indicators of female preference. In response to songs from an array of males, each female expressed an individual-specific song preference, and those preferences were consistent across tests spanning many months. Across a population of females, songs of some males were more commonly preferred than others, and females preferred female-directed songs more than undirected songs, suggesting that some song features are broadly attractive. Preferences were indistinguishable for females that did or did not have social experience with the singers, indicating that female preference is strongly directed by song features rather than experiences associated with the singer. Analysis of song properties revealed several candidate parameters that may influence female evaluation. In an initial investigation of those parameters, females could be very selective for one song feature yet not selective for another. Therefore, multiple song parameters are evaluated independently. Together these findings reveal the nature of signal evaluation and mate choice in this species."

The GCL includes retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and displaced amacrine cells (dACs) that temporarily reside in the inner neuroblastic layer (INbL) but then migrate early postnatally through the INbL to form a single-cell GCL (Reese, 2011Reese B.E.

Polarization and orientation of retinal ganglion cells in vivo.Neural Dev. 2006; 1: 2Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). While progress has been made toward understanding how processes emanating from retinal neurons become stratified, the molecular mechanisms that direct RGC and dAC migration to form the single-cell GCL remain to be elucidated. Secreted extracellular matrix (ECM) laminin proteins guide GCL progenitors as they migrate to their final position in the retina (Randlett et al., 2011Randlett O. Poggi L. Zolessi F.R. Harris W.A. The oriented emergence of axons from retinal ganglion cells is directed by laminin contact in vivo.Neuron. 2011; 70: 266-280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Laminins are highly enriched in the basal lamina of the inner-limiting membrane (ILM) and serve as non-cell-autonomous instructive signals that orient RGC axon emergence and initial guidance during GCL cell migration (Libby et al., 1997Libby R.T.

Laminins are required for the establishment of the single-cell GCL; null mutations in the genes encoding β2 or γ3 laminin chains produce ectopic multilayered GCL cell aggregates that form beyond the ILM (Edwards et al., 2010Edwards M.M.

Although accumulating evidence supports an instructive role for laminins in GCL establishment, how differential laminin distribution is sensed and interpreted by migrating neurons is not known. Integrins are laminin receptors essential for neural migration and stratification in regions of the nervous system other than the retina, acting both neuron autonomously and nonautonomously (Anton et al., 1999Anton E.S.

One of these pathways involves phosphorylation of Crk-associated substrate (Cas) cytosolic adaptor proteins by activated focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and Src tyrosine phosphorylation; this results in the recruitment of Crk, activation of Rac, and actin cytoskeleton remodeling (Bouton et al., 2001Bouton A.H.

However, evidence supporting a role for Cas proteins downstream of integrins during vertebrate neural development comes from in vitro tissue culture studies (Bargon et al., 2005Bargon S.D. Gunning P.W. O’Neill G.M. The Cas family docking protein, HEF1, promotes the formation of neurite-like membrane extensions.Biochim. Biophys.

Functions of the adapter protein Cas: signal convergence and the determination of cellular responses.Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6448-6458Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Here, we show that β1-Integrin and Cas adaptor proteins are highly expressed in the inner neuroblastic layer (INbL) of the mouse retina and that β1-Integrin is required for proper GCL organization. We also provide in vivo evidence that Cas signaling adaptor proteins are essential for β1-Integrin function during vertebrate neural development by investigating their role in the establishment of the GCL. These results provide insight into how migrating retinal neurons respond to the laminin-rich ILM, resulting in the characteristic single-cell layer organization of the GCL. To explore the instructive role played by laminin in establishing the GCL, we first asked whether the laminin receptor β1-Integrin is expressed during retinal development. We performed β1-Integrin immunohistological analyses and found that during embryonic development expression of β1-Integrin is enriched in the INbL, with higher levels of expression close to the ILM (Figures 1A and 1B ). This expression continues during the first week after birth (postnatal day 4 [P4]; Figure 1C); however, at P14 β1-Integrin expression in the retina is downregulated and becomes restricted to vascular tissue (Figure 1D). This expression pattern suggests that β1-Integrin participates in GCL progenitor migration and organization. To investigate the requirement for β1-Integrin during retinal development, we used mouse lines that express panretinal Cre recombinase expression (Six3Cre) (Furuta et al., 2000Furuta Y. Lagutin O. Hogan B.L. Oliver G.C. Retina- and ventral forebrain-specific Cre recombinase activity in transgenic mice.Genesis. 2000; 26: 130-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) or neural retina-specific Cre (Pax6αCre) (Marquardt et al., 2001Marquardt T. Ashery-Padan R. Andrejewski N. Scardigli R. Guillemot F. Gruss P. Pax6 is required for the multipotent state of retinal progenitor cells.Cell. 2001; 105: 43-55Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar), together with a conditional β1-Integrin allele (Itgb1f) (Raghavan et al., 2000Raghavan S. Bauer C. Mundschau G. Li Q. Fuchs E. Conditional ablation of beta1 integrin in skin. Severe defects in epidermal proliferation, basement membrane formation, and hair follicle invagination.J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 1149-1160Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar), to selectively remove β1-Integrin (Itgb1) in the retina. In P14 control animals, GCL cells are organized into a single-cell layer adjacent to the ILM (Figures 1E and 1G). In Six3Cre;Itgb1f/f or Pax6αCre;Itgb1f/f retinas, the GCL fails to resolve into a single-cell layer (Figures 1F and 1H). In these mutant retinas, ectopic aggregates that include GCL cells form multilayered “rosette” structures beyond the ILM, which is disrupted at the sites where these aggregates form (Figures 1F and 1H). These rosette structures include displaced ACs (anti-ChAT+: starburst ACs; Figures S1A and S1B available online) and RGCs (anti-Brn3b+; Figures S1C and S1D). Ectopically localized ACs and RGCs in these mutant retinas recruit at least some of their presynaptic partners since rod bipolar neurites (PKCα+; Figures S1E and S1F) invade the rosettes. These results show that β1-Integrin is required for the formation of the single-cell GCL during retina development. During cortical development, β1-Integrin regulates Cajal-Retzius cell organization and maintains basal lamina integrity (Graus-Porta et al., 2001Graus-Porta D. Blaess S. Senften M. Littlewood-Evans A. Damsky C. Huang Z. Orban P. Klein R. Schittny J.C. Müller U. Beta1-class integrins regulate the development of laminae and folia in the cerebral and cerebellar cortex.Neuron. 2001; 31: 367-379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). To determine whether β1-Integrin is required for formation of the ILM basal lamina, we analyzed ILM integrity at different developmental stages in Six3Cre;Itgb1f/f animals. At embryonic day 14.5 (E14.5) formation of the ILM appears normal, as revealed by anti-laminin immunohistochemistry in both control and Six3Cre;Itgb1f/f retinas (Figures 1I and 1J). Furthermore, the ILM is mostly intact in Six3Cre;Itgb1f/f retinas at E18.5, even at sites where aggregates have started to form (Figures 1K, 1L, S1G, and S1H). Later in retinal development ectopic aggregates continue to grow, and the ILM in Six3Cre;Itgb1f/f mutant retinas becomes highly disorganized (P7; Figures 1M and 1N). This suggests that ILM disruption arises as a secondary consequence of RGC positioning defects. Phosphorylation of Cas adaptor proteins is thought to mediate integrin signaling during neural development (Bourgin et al., 2007Bourgin C. Murai K.K. Richter M. Pasquale E.B. The EphA4 receptor regulates dendritic spine remodeling by affecting beta1-integrin signaling pathways.J. Cell Biol. 2007; 178: 1295-1307Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, Huang et al., 2007Huang Z. Yazdani U. Thompson-Peer K.L. Kolodkin A.L. Terman J.R. Crk-associated substrate (Cas) signaling protein functions with integrins to specify axon guidance during development.Development. 2007; 134: 2337-2347Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Does β1-Integrin signaling during RGC and AC positioning proceed through Cas, and is Cas phosphorylation relevant for GCL elaboration in the vertebrate retina? To address these issues, we first asked whether Cas phosphorylation is affected by loss of β1-Integrin. In control animals at E18.5, phosphotyrosine-p130Cas (PY-Cas) is highly enriched in the INbL, particularly in close proximity to the ILM (Figure 1O). In contrast, PY-Cas is almost completely absent in Six3Cre;Itgb1f/f retinas (Figure 1P), although total p130Cas protein expression is not apparently affected (Figures S1G and S1H). The antibody we used to detect PY-Cas is specific for p130Cas since the protein band it detects in western analysis of embryo lystates is dramatically reduced when exon 2 of p130Cas is removed in our p130Cas targeted mutant (Figure S2). These results show that Itgb1 is required for p130Cas phosphorylation during GCL formation. We next undertook detailed histological analyses of p130Cas expression in the developing retina, utilizing a GENSAT BAC transgenic mouse line that expresses enhanced GFP (EGFP) under the control of p130Cas regulatory sequences (Gong et al., 2003Gong S. Zheng C. Doughty M.L. Losos K. Didkovsky N. Schambra U.B. Nowak N.J. Joyner A. Leblanc G. Hatten M.E. Heintz N. A gene expression atlas of the central nervous system based on bacterial artificial chromosomes.Nature. 2003; 425: 917-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (1599) Google Scholar, Heintz, 2004Heintz N. Gene expression nervous system atlas (GENSAT).Nat. Neurosci. 2004; 7: 483Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). This line allows detection of cells expressing p130Cas and phosphorylated p130Cas in the same section. The p130Cas-EGFP-Bac retinal EGFP expression pattern is consistent with that of endogenous p130Cas in wild-type (WT) animals (Figures 2A–2D and Figures S2A–S2D; data not shown). Although p130Cas is expressed broadly in the INbL during embryonic development, phosphorylated p130Cas is highly enriched in the cells that are in close proximity to the ILM (Figures 2A and Figure S2E). Soon after birth (P0 and P7), high levels of phosphorylated Cas are mainly present in close proximity to the ILM and also in the incipient IPL (Figures 2B and 2C). As development progresses, p130Cas phosphorylation becomes restricted to the GCL and a small subset of cells in the INL (P14 and adult; Figure 2D and Figure S2F). Therefore, p130Cas and phospho-tyrosine-p130Cas expression patterns are consistent with Cas involvement in GCL organization. Since p130Cas is expressed during retinal development and Cas phosphorylation is regulated by β1-Integrin, we next asked whether p130Cas is required during RGC and AC migration. Since p130Cas−/− mice die early in embryogenesis (Honda et al., 1998Honda H. Oda H. Nakamoto T. Honda Z. Sakai R. Suzuki T. Saito T. Nakamura K. Nakao K. Ishikawa T. et al.Cardiovascular anomaly, impaired actin bundling and resistance to Src-induced transformation in mice lacking p130Cas.Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 361-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar), we generated a conditional p130Cas allele (p130Casf; Figure S2). p130Cas alone is not required for GCL development since Six3Cre; p130Casf/Δ and Pax6αCre; p130Casf/Δ retinas develop normally and are indistinguishable from WT (Figures S3A–S3C; data not shown). The expression patterns during retina development of the two other mouse Cas family members, CasL and Sin, highly overlap with p130Cas (Figures S3D–S3L), suggesting that CasL and Sin compensate for the lack of p130Cas in Six3Cre; p130Casf/Δ and Pax6αCre; p130Casf/Δ mice and that Cas adaptor proteins might act redundantly. Therefore, we performed retina-specific p130Cas ablation in a CasL−/−;Sin−/− double null mutant genetic background (we refer to p130Casf/Δ;CasL−/−;Sin−/− mice as triple conditional knockouts [TcKOs]) (Donlin et al., 2005Donlin L.T. Danzl N.M. Wanjalla C. Alexandropoulos K. Deficiency in expression of the signaling protein Sin/Efs leads to T-lymphocyte activation and mucosal inflammation.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 11035-11046Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, Seo et al., 2005Seo S. Asai T. Saito T. Suzuki T. Morishita Y. Nakamoto T. Ichikawa M. Yamamoto G. Kawazu M. Yamagata T. et al.Crk-associated substrate lymphocyte type is required for lymphocyte trafficking and marginal zone B cell maintenance.J. Immunol. 2005; 175: 3492-3501Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). When examined at P14, both Six3Cre;TcKO and Pax6αCre;TcKO retinas exhibit, with full penetrance and expressivity, severe disorganization of the GCL and formation of ectopic rosette structures beyond the INbL, phenotypes not observed in control retinas (Figures 2E–2H; n = 5 for each genotype; 3 ± 1.3 aggregates/mm of sectioned retina). Similar phenotypes are also observed in Six3Cre; p130Casf/Δ;CasL−/−;Sin+/− animals, but not in any other combination of Cas family alleles (Figures S3M–S3O). Ectopic cell clusters are found throughout the Six3Cre;TcKO retina, and they can be visualized using retina whole-mount staining with anti-calbindin, a marker for subsets of RGCs and ACs. This is in sharp contrast to the even distribution of unclustered calbindin+ cells in control animals (Figures 2I and 2J). What are the identities of cells in these ectopic rosette structures? Using a battery of RGC and AC markers, we found that many cells present in the ectopic aggregates express calretinin (subsets of ACs and RGCs; Figures 3A and 3B ), ChAT (starburst ACs; Figures 3C and 3D), and Brn3a (RGCs; Figures 3E and 3F), showing that ectopic aggregates include both RGCs and ACs. Bipolar cells send projections into these aggregates since we observe neurites expressing the rod bipolar cell marker PKCα in the rosettes (Figures 3G and 3H). Further, small ectopic presynaptic terminals appear in and around the ectopic aggregates, indicated by the presence of neurites labeled with excitatory (vGlut1; Figures 3I and 3J) and inhibitory (vGAT; Figures 3K and 3L) presynaptic markers. No obvious phenotypes were observed in RGC axon projection orientation when Six3Cre;TcKO embryonic retinas were stained using neurofilament antibodies (data not shown). We next assessed the integrity of the ILM in Six3Cre;TcKO retinas using antibodies raised against laminin and the proteoglycan perlecan (Figures 3M–3P). Although the ILM is well organized in control animals at P14 (Figures 3M and 3O), it is completely disrupted in Six3Cre;TcKO animals at sites where aggregates form (Figures 3N and 3P). These phenotypes closely resemble Six3Cre;Itgb1f/f mutant retinas (Figure 1) and demonstrate a requirement for Cas adaptor proteins during RGC and AC positioning and formation of the single-cell GCL. Though severe ILM defects are observed in Six3Cre;TcKO retinas, is ILM integrity compromised throughout retinal development in these mutant retinas? The ILM forms normally in Six3Cre;TcKO retinas and is indistinguishable in mutants and controls at E14.5 (Figures 4A and 4B ). In E17.5 Six3Cre;TcKO retinas, ectopic cell aggregates form prior to the complete disruption of the ILM (Figures 4C and 4D), similar to Six3Cre;Itgb1f/f mutants (Figure 1L). Thus, retinal neuron positioning defects in these mutants arise in the presence of a nearly intact ILM. By P0, the ILM becomes more disorganized in Six3Cre;TcKO retinas relative to controls, and this occurs only at sites where aggregates have formed (Figures 4E and 4F and Figures S4F and S4G); no obvert disruption of the ILM is observed where aggregates do not form (Figure S4G). The severity of ILM disruption in mutant retinas increases as development progresses and as ectopic aggregates increase in size (P4; Figures 4G and 4H). Aggregate formation and ILM disruption result in the secondary recruitment of vascular tissue into these rosettes (Figures S4H–S4K) and also mild to moderate defects in Müller glia (MG) organization (Figures S4L and S4M). These data strongly suggest that ILM defects at sites where ectopic aggregates form are a secondary consequence of initial migration defects and ectopic rosette growth. A large number of RGCs are mislocalized in Six3Cre;TcKO retinas. Does the final RGC location affect central projection targeting by Six3Cre;TcKO RGC axons? We performed injections of cholera toxin subunit B (CTB) conjugated to fluorescent Alexa dyes into the retinas of control and Six3Cre;TcKO animals and found no obvious differences in the central axonal projections of control or Six3Cre;TcKO animals (Figures S4A–S4D′). This suggests that retinorecipient targeting of RGC axons is not affected even though many RGCs end up in an ectopic location. To ask whether RGCs in ectopic rosette structures project to retinorecipient areas, we performed retrograde labeling by injecting CTB Alexa 546 into the LGN in Six3Cre;TcKO and control mice (Figures 4I and 4J and Figures S4E and S4E′). All ectopic aggregates that we observed in Six3Cre;TcKO retinas included CTB+ cells (Figure 4J; n = 3 animals, 6 retinas, and 5–10 aggregates per retina). Therefore, RGCs in Six3Cre;TcKO retina rosettes are indeed able to project to retinorecipient areas in the thalamus. Although Six3Cre;TcKO and Pax6αCre;TcKO retinas exhibit similar phenotypes (Figures 2E–2H; data not shown), the Pax6αCre transgene has the added advantage of driving coexpression of Cre recombinase and EGFP (Marquardt et al., 2001Marquardt T. Ashery-Padan R. Andrejewski N. Scardigli R. Guillemot F. Gruss P. Pax6 is required for the multipotent state of retinal progenitor cells.Cell. 2001; 105: 43-55Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar). The Pax6αCre transgene is expressed broadly in neural progenitors for only a limited developmental period, after which expression becomes restricted to subpopulations of ACs and RGCs (Marquardt et al., 2001Marquardt T. Ashery-Padan R. Andrejewski N. Scardigli R. Guillemot F. Gruss P. Pax6 is required for the multipotent state of retinal progenitor cells.Cell. 2001; 105: 43-55Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar). We took advantage of these Pax6αCre transgene properties to assess whether cells that form ectopic rosettes are ACs and RGCs in which Cre recombinase expression was maintained during development. Most of the cells that compose ectopic aggregates in Pax6αCre;TcKO P4 retinas are EGFP+ (Figures 4K and 4L), and all rosettes cosegregate with EGFP+ cells, suggesting that cells in which efficient recombination of the conditional allele occurs contribute to the rosettes. To test whether inefficient recombination of the conditional p130Casf allele might account for the formation of rosettes, we stained control and Six3Cre;TcKO retinas with the phosphotyrosine-Cas antibody (PY-Cas; Figures 4M and 4N). Though reduced, some PY-Cas staining remains in the Six3Cre;TcKO retinas compared to control retinas, suggesting that disruption of Cas expression does not occur in some retinal cells. Importantly, all of the cells that form ectopic aggregates show strong abrogation of PY-Cas expression (Figures 4M and 4N). Since Six3Cre and Pax6αCre transgenes do not drive expression of Cre recombinase in the neuroepithelial cells that form the ILM (Figures S4N and S4N′; Marquardt et al., 2001Marquardt T. Ashery-Padan R. Andrejewski N. Scardigli R. Guillemot F. Gruss P. Pax6 is required for the multipotent state of retinal progenitor cells.Cell. 2001; 105: 43-55Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar), our findings suggest that Integrin-Cas signaling plays a neuron-autonomous role in the INbL during the positioning of RGCs and ACs required for organizing the GCL. To investigate whether Integrin-Cas signaling functions cell autonomously during GCL organization, we used in utero electroporation to introduce a plasmid expressing both Cre recombinase and EGFP under the strong CAGGs promoter (CRE-IRES-EGFP) into WT or TcKO retinas at E13.5 (Figures 4O and 4P). At this stage of retina development, GCL progenitors are already born and migrating through the INbL (Garcia-Frigola et al., 2007Garcia-Frigola C. Carreres M.I. Vegar C. Herrera E. Gene delivery into mouse retinal ganglion cells by in utero electroporation.BMC Dev. Biol. 2007; 7: 103Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, Petros et al., 2009Petros T.J. Rebsam A. Mason C.A.

In WT retinas, RGC and AC migration proceeds normally, and no electroporated (EGFP+) cells are detected beyond the laminin-rich ILM (Figure 4O; n = 3 animals). However, Cre/EGFP-electroporated TcKO retinas exhibit ectopic cell aggregates beyond the ILM (Figure 4P). Some of the cells in every aggregate that we observe are EGFP+ (n = 5 aggregates from 3 independent animals). These observations show a rosette-autonomous requirement for Cas proteins during GCL organization. Taken together with the phenotypes that we observe in the neural retina-specific conditional knockouts (Pax6αCre; TcKO and Pax6αCre; Itgb1f/f; Figures 1H, 2H, and 4L; data not shown), our results strongly suggest a role for Integrin-Cas signaling in regulating GCL progenitor positioning and organization into a single-cell layer. Importantly, although all ectopic rosettes contain Cre-EGFP+ cells, we find that the average rosette is composed of 51% ± 21% GFP+ cells (mean ± SD), and some cells in every rosette in mutant retinas are EGFP− (Figure 4P). This is consistent with secondary, non-cell-autonomous defects caused by the initial disruption of the ILM by aberrant migration of EGFP+/Ca"
https://openalex.org/W2024395876,"Tropical agro-forest landscapes are global priority areas for biodiversity conservation. Little is known about the ability of these landscapes to sustain large late successional forest trees upon which much forest biodiversity depends. These landscapes are subject to fragmentation and additional habitat degradation which may limit tree recruitment and thus compromise numerous ecosystem services including carbon storage and timber production. Dysoxylum malabaricum is a large canopy tree species in the Meliaceae, a family including many important tropical timber trees. This species is found in highly fragmented forest patches within a complex agro-forest landscape of the Western Ghats biodiversity hot spot, South India. In this paper we combined a molecular assessment of inbreeding with ecological and demographic data to explore the multiple threats to recruitment of this tree species. An evaluation of inbreeding, using eleven microsatellite loci in 297 nursery-reared seedlings collected form low and high density forest patches embedded in an agro-forest matrix, shows that mating between related individuals in low density patches leads to reduced seedling performance. By quantifying habitat degradation and tree recruitment within these forest patches we show that increasing canopy openness and the increased abundance of pioneer tree species lead to a general decline in the suitability of forest patches for the recruitment of D. malabaricum. We conclude that elevated inbreeding due to reduced adult tree density coupled with increased degradation of forest patches, limit the recruitment of this rare late successional tree species. Management strategies which maintain canopy cover and enhance local densities of adult trees in agro-forest mosaics will be required to ensure D. malabaricum persists in these landscapes. Our study highlights the need for a holistic understanding of the incipient processes that threaten populations of many important and rare tropical tree species in human dominated agro-forest landscapes."

Using mRNA profiling, we identified the complement of membrane molecules regulated by the homeobox TF Even-skipped (Eve), the major determinant of dorsal motor neuron (dMN) identity in Drosophila. Combinatorial loss- and gain-of-function genetic analyses of Eve target genes indicate that the integrated actions of attractive, repulsive, and adhesive molecules direct eve-dependent dMN axon guidance. Furthermore, combined misexpression of Eve target genes is sufficient to partially restore CNS exit and can convert the guidance behavior of interneurons to that of dMNs. Finally, we show that a network of TFs, comprised of eve, zfh1, and grain, induces the expression of the Unc5 and Beaten-path guidance receptors and the Fasciclin 2 and Neuroglian adhesion molecules to guide individual dMN axons."
https://openalex.org/W2084819063,"During development and progression of malignant melanoma, an important role has been attributed to alterations of cell-cell adhesions, in particular, to a “cadherin switch” from E- to N-cadherin. We have previously shown that a subtype of melanoma cells express the desmosomal cadherin desmoglein 2 as non-junction-bound cell surface protein in addition to classical cadherins. To study the role of desmoglein 2 in melanoma cells, melanoma lines containing high endogenous amounts of desmoglein 2 were depleted of the protein by RNA interference. Transwell migration and scratch wounding assays showed markedly increased migration upon desmoglein 2 suppression whereas proliferation and viability remained unaltered. In gene expression profiles, desmoglein 2 depletion was associated with overexpression of migration-related genes. Strongest overexpression was found for secretogranin II which has not been reported in melanoma cells before. The bioactive peptide derived from secretogranin II, secretoneurin, is known to exert chemoattractive functions and was demonstrated here to stimulate melanoma cell migration. In summary, we show that desmoglein 2 expression attenuates migration of melanoma cells. The mechanism of desmoglein 2 impaired cell migration is mediated by downregulation of secretogranin II. Loss of desmoglein 2 increases expression of secretogranin II, followed by an enhanced migratory activity of melanoma cells. Our data add a new pathway of regulating melanoma cell migration related to a desmoglein 2 – secretogranin II axis."
https://openalex.org/W2086357172,"The winter moth, Nyssiodes lefuarius, has a unique life history in that adults appear during early spring after a long pupal diapause from summer to winter. The moth exhibits striking sexual dimorphism in wing form; males have functional wings of normal size, whereas females lack wings. We previously found that cell death of the pupal epithelium of females appears to display condensed chromatin within phagocytes. To provide additional detailed data for interpreting the role of cell death, we performed light microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and TUNEL assay. We consequently detected two modes of cell death, i.e., dying cells showed both DNA fragmentation derived from epithelial nuclei and autophagic vacuole formation. To elucidate the switching mechanism of sex-specific wing degeneration in females of N. lefuarius, we tested the effects of the steroid hormone 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) on pupal diapause termination and wing morphogenesis in both sexes. When 20E (5.4 µg) was injected into both sexes within 2 days of pupation, wing degeneration started 4 days after 20E injection in females, whereas wing morphogenesis and scale formation started 6 days after 20E injection in males. We discuss two important findings: (1) degeneration of the pupal wing epithelium of females was not only due to apoptosis and phagocytotic activation but also to autophagy and epithelial cell shrinkage; and (2) 20E terminated the summer diapause of pupae, and triggered selective programmed cell death only of the female-pupal wing epithelium in the wingless female winter moth."
https://openalex.org/W1975681223,"The chromosomal passenger complex (CPC) is a key regulator of eukaryotic cell division, consisting of the protein kinase Aurora B/Ipl1 in association with its activator (INCENP/Sli15) and two additional proteins (Survivin/Bir1 and Borealin/Nbl1). Here we have identified multiple sites of CPC autophosphorylation on yeast Sli15 that are located within its central microtubule-binding domain and examined the functional significance of their phosphorylation by Ipl1 through mutation of these sites, either to non-phosphorylatable alanine (sli15-20A) or to acidic residues to mimic constitutive phosphorylation (sli15-20D). Both mutant sli15 alleles confer chromosome instability, but this is mediated neither by changes in the capacity of Sli15 to activate Ipl1 kinase nor by decreased efficiency of chromosome biorientation, a key process in cell division that requires CPC function. Instead, we find that mimicking constitutive phosphorylation of Sli15 on the Ipl1 phosphorylation sites causes delocalization of the CPC in metaphase, whereas blocking phosphorylation of Sli15 on the Ipl1 sites drives excessive localization of Sli15 to the mitotic spindle in pre-anaphase cells. Consistent with these results, direct interaction of Sli15 with microtubules in vitro is greatly reduced either following phosphorylation by Ipl1 or when constitutive phosphorylation at the Ipl1-dependent phosphorylation sites is mimicked by aspartate or glutamate substitutions. Furthermore, we find that mimicking Ipl1 phosphorylation of Sli15 interferes with the 'tension checkpoint'--the CPC-dependent mechanism through which cells activate the spindle assembly checkpoint to delay anaphase in the absence of tension on kinetochore-microtubule attachments. Ipl1-dependent phosphorylation of Sli15 therefore inhibits its association with microtubules both in vivo and in vitro and may negatively regulate the tension checkpoint mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2005537088,"Fibrous papules of the face are hamartomas characterized by stellate-shaped stromal cells, multinucleated giant cells, and proliferative blood vessels in the dermis. The pathogenesis of fibrous papules remains unclear. There is a striking microscopic resemblance between fibrous papules and tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC)-associated angiofibromas. A germline mutation of the TSC1 or TSC2 gene, leading to activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, accounts for the pathogenesis of TSC-associated angiofibromas. Activated mTOR subsequently activates p70 ribosomal protein S6 kinase (p70S6K) and ribosomal protein S6 (S6) by phosphorylation. Rapamycin, a mTOR inhibitor, is effective in treating TSC-associated angiofibromas. The aim of this study was to understand whether the mTOR pathway is activated in fibrous papules. We studied immunoexpressions of phosphorylated (p-) mTOR effectors in fibrous papules, TSC-associated angiofibromas, and normal skin controls. P-mTOR, p-p70S6K and p-S6 were highly expressed in dermal stromal cells and epidermal keratinocytes in fibrous papules and TSC-associated angiofibromas but not in fibroblasts and epidermal keratinocytes of normal skin controls (p<0.001). The results suggest topical rapamycin may be a novel treatment option for fibrous papules."
