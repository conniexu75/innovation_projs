Introduction Postoperative AKI is associated with an increase in short and long-term mortality. Using IGFBP7 and TIMP-2 for early detection of cellular kidney injury, thus allowing the early initiation of renal protection measures, may represent a new concept of evaluating renal function. Methods In this prospective study, urinary [TIMP-2]×[IGFBP7] was measured in surgical patients at high risk for AKI. A predefined cut-off value of [TIMP-2]×[IGFBP7] >0.3 was used for assessing diagnostic accuracy. Perioperative characteristics were evaluated, and ROC analyses as well as logistic regression models of risk assessment were calculated with and without a [TIMP-2]×[IGFBP7] test. Results 107 patients were included in the study, of whom 45 (42%) developed AKI. The highest median values of biomarker were detected in septic, transplant and patients after hepatic surgery (1.24 vs 0.45 vs 0.47 ng/l2/1000). The area under receiving operating characteristic curve (AUC) for the risk of any AKI was 0.85, for early use of RRT 0.83 and for 28-day mortality 0.77. In a multivariable model with established perioperative risk factors, the [TIMP-2]×[IGFBP7] test was the strongest predictor of AKI and significantly improved the risk assessment (p<0.001). Conclusions Urinary [TIMP-2]×[IGFBP7] test sufficiently detect patients with risk of AKI after major non-cardiac surgery. Due to its rapid responsiveness it extends the time frame for intervention to prevent development of AKI."
https://openalex.org/W2145096223,"In situ hybridization (ISH) is an extremely useful tool for localizing gene expression and changes in expression to specific cell populations in tissue samples across numerous research fields. Typically, a research group will put forth significant effort to design, generate, validate and then utilize in situ probes in thin or ultrathin paraffin embedded tissue sections. While combining ISH and IHC is an established technique, the combination of RNAscope ISH, a commercially available ISH assay with single transcript sensitivity, and IHC in thick free-floating tissue sections has not been described. Here, we provide a protocol that combines RNAscope ISH with IHC in thick free-floating tissue sections from the brain and allows simultaneous co-localization of genes and proteins in individual cells. This approach works well with a number of ISH probes (e.g. small proline-rich repeat 1a, βIII-tubulin, tau, and β-actin) and IHC antibody stains (e.g. tyrosine hydroxylase, βIII-tubulin, NeuN, and glial fibrillary acidic protein) in rat brain sections. In addition, we provide examples of combining ISH-IHC dual staining in primary neuron cultures and double-ISH labeling in thick free-floating tissue sections from the brain. Finally, we highlight the ability of RNAscope to detect ectopic DNA in neurons transduced with viral vectors. RNAscope ISH is a commercially available technology that utilizes a branched or ""tree"" in situ method to obtain ultrasensitive, single transcript detection. Immunohistochemistry is a tried and true method for identifying specific protein in cell populations. The combination of a sensitive and versatile oligonucleotide detection method with an established and versatile protein assay is a significant advancement in studies using free-floating tissue sections."

Objectives The purpose of this study was to assess the prevalence and associated factors of mental distress among undergraduate students of University of Gondar, Northwest Ethiopia. Methods Institution based cross sectional study was conducted among 836 students from April 9–11/2014. Stratified multistage sampling technique was used to select the study participants. Data were collected using pretested and structured self-administered questionnaire. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression model was fitted to identify factors associated with mental distress among students. An adjusted odds ratio with 95% confidence interval was computed to determine the level of significance. Results Prevalence of mental distress among students was found to be 40.9%. Female sex (AOR = 1.65; 95% CI 1.17–2.30), lack of interest towards their field of study (AOR = 2.28; 95% CI 1.49–3.50), not having close friends (AOR = 1.48; 95% CI 1.03–2.14), never attend religious programs (AOR = 1.58; 95% CI 1.02–2.46), conflict with friends (AOR = 1.93; 95% CI 1.41–2.65), having financial distress (AOR1.49 = 95% CI 1.05, 2.10), family history of mental illness (AOR = 2.12; 95% CI 1.31–3.45), Ever use of Khat (AOR = 1.71; 95% CI 1.12–2.59), lower grade than anticipated(AOR = 2.07; 95% CI 1.51–2.83), lack of vacation or break (AOR = 1.46; 95% CI 1.06–2.02), and low social support(AOR = 2.58; 95% CI 1.58–4.22) were significantly associated with mental distress. Conclusion The overall prevalence of mental distress among students was found to be high. Therefore, it is recommended that mental distress needs due attention and remedial action from policy makers, college officials, non-governmental organizations, parents, students and other concerned bodies."
https://openalex.org/W1988371431,"Proenzyme maturation is a general mechanism to control the activation of enzymes. Catalytically active members of the A Disintegrin And Metalloprotease (ADAM) family of membrane-anchored metalloproteases are synthesized as proenzymes, in which the latency is maintained by their autoinhibitory pro-domains. A proteolytic processing then transforms the proenzyme into a catalytically active form. The removal of the pro-domain of ADAMs is currently thought to depend on processing at a canonical consensus site for the proprotein convertase Furin (RXXR) between the pro- and the catalytic domain. Here, we demonstrate that this previously described canonical site is a secondary cleavage site to a prerequisite cleavage in a newly characterized upstream PC site embedded within the pro-domain sequence. The novel upstream regulatory site is important for the maturation of several ADAM proenzymes. Mutations in the upstream regulatory site of ADAM17, ADAM10, and ADAM9 do not prevent pro-domain processing between the pro- and metalloprotease domain, but nevertheless, cause significantly reduced catalytic activity. Thus, our results have uncovered a novel functionally relevant PC processing site in the N-terminal part of the pro-domain that is important for the activation of these ADAMs. These results suggest that the novel PC site is part of a general mechanism underlying proenzyme maturation of ADAMs that is independent of processing at the previously identified canonical Furin cleavage site.Background: Proprotein convertases (PCs) control the maturation of several A Disintegrin and Metalloprotease (ADAM) proteases.Results: Mutating a newly identified upstream PC site interferes with activation of ADAMs 9, 10, and 17.Conclusion: Processing at the upstream PC site is important for the activation of these ADAMs.Significance: The upstream PC site in several ADAMs suggests a novel general mechanism for their maturation.

The term proenzyme refers to an inactive precursor of an enzyme, in which the N-terminal portion of the protein acts as an autoinhibitor to keep the protein in its latent form.

Despite their importance as major proteases responsible for the secretion and maturation of vital membrane proteins in vivo, the activation mechanism of ADAMs by processing of their pro-domains is not fully understood.

Catalytically active ADAMs are generated as inactive proenzymes, in which the N-terminal pro-domain is responsible for inhibiting the activity via the “cysteine switch” mechanism (11.Van Wart H.E. Birkedal-Hansen H. The cysteine switch: a principle of regulation of metalloproteinase activity with potential applicability to the entire matrix metalloproteinase gene family.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1990; 87: 5578-5582Crossref PubMed Scopus (1201) Google Scholar), where a cysteine residue in the pro-domain coordinates the zinc ion in the catalytic site, preventing proteolytic activity. One of the most important post-translational modifications of ADAMs is thought to be their pro-domain removal in the trans-Golgi network, a process that results in the mature form of the enzyme. The role of the pro-domain in the biosynthesis of the enzyme has been demonstrated to be more than keeping the enzyme in its latent form. In fact, the presence of the pro-domain was also shown to be required for proper intracellular trafficking of ADAM10 and -17 (12.Anders A. Gilbert S. Garten W. Postina R. Fahrenholz F.

Most members of the ADAM family of metalloproteases contain a proprotein convertase (PC) consensus cleavage site, characterized by a dibasic motif (16.Molloy S.S. Bresnahan P.A. Leppla S.H.

The involvement of PC or Furin, a member of the PC family, in the activation of ADAMs has been demonstrated in several studies. For example, mutations in the putative Furin site located between the pro-domain and the catalytic domain of ADAM10, ADAM12, and ADAM19 prevent the release of the pro-domain, thus keeping the enzyme latent (12.Anders A.

In addition, inhibitors of the early secretory pathway, brefeldin A and monensin, have been shown to block the processing of ADAM9 and ADAM15 in the Golgi apparatus (14.Roghani M. Becherer J.D.

This intracellular location where the maturation of ADAMs takes place is consistent with the localization of Furin and other PCs (17.Nakayama K. Furin: a mammalian subtilisin/Kex2p-like endoprotease involved in processing of a wide variety of precursor proteins.Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 625-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar). However, autocatalytic removal of the pro-domain has been shown for maturation of ADAM8 and ADAM28 (21.Howard L. Maciewicz R.A. Blobel C.P.

These enzymes recognize dibasic motifs and cleave the peptide bond on the carboxyl side (16.Molloy S.S. Bresnahan P.A. Leppla S.H. Klimpel K.R. Thomas G. Human furin is a calcium-dependent serine endoprotease that recognizes the sequence Arg-X-X-Arg and efficiently cleaves anthrax toxin protective antigen.J. Biol.

Furin: a mammalian subtilisin/Kex2p-like endoprotease involved in processing of a wide variety of precursor proteins.Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 625-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar). As a major PC, Furin is concentrated in the trans-Golgi network and cycles between this compartment and the cell surface through the endocytic pathway. Numerous studies have shown that Furin activates a large number of proproteins in multiple compartments (23.Steiner D.F. The proprotein convertases.Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1998; 2: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar). The minimal recognition sequence for Furin requires basic residues at P1 and P4, but the consensus sequence for efficient cleavage by Furin is RXXR, although an amino acid with a hydrophobic aliphatic side chain is not suitable at the P1′ position (17.Nakayama K. Furin: a mammalian subtilisin/Kex2p-like endoprotease involved in processing of a wide variety of precursor proteins.Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 625-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar). In this report we show that the removal of the ADAM pro-domain occurs via cleavage of two different sites, in which, the boundary canonical sites are secondary to upstream and unstructured regions, bearing regulatory cleavage sites embedded within the enzyme pro-domain. Processing at the upstream regulatory site in the pro-domain is mandatory for proenzyme maturation and full enzyme activation. Mutations in the unstructured upstream regulatory site did not prevent pro-domain processing at the canonical site, but nevertheless, gave rise to ADAMs in a pseudo mature form on the cell surface with significantly reduced activity compared with controls. Thus, our results present a novel and potentially general mechanism underlying the maturation of pro-ADAMs that deviates from the current canonical model of activation by processing at the boundary between the pro- and metalloprotease domains. Sequence alignment of all the pro-domains of members of the ADAM family of membrane-anchored metalloproteases (including the signal peptide) were computed by using the ClustalW2 server. The alignment was cross-referenced with the propeptide cleavage potential predicted by the ProP server (24.Duckert P. Brunak S. Blom N. Prediction of proprotein convertase cleavage sites.Protein Eng. Des. Sel. 2004; 17: 107-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar), and the ADAM members, which have been identified to have an upstream PC site around the same region, were picked for further analysis. The following ADAM members were found to possess an upstream PC site: ADAM8-RVRR44/A45, ADAM9-RERR56/E57 ADAM10-RAKR51/E52, ADAM11-RLVR55/E56, and ADAM17-RKR58/D59. The pro-domains of these ADAMs were analyzed for their potential to be disordered using the Disopred server (25.Ward J.J. Sodhi J.S. McGuffin L.J. Buxton B.F. Jones D.T. Prediction and functional analysis of native disorder in proteins from the three kingdoms of life.J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 337: 635-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (1608) Google Scholar) with a threshold of 5%. Mutations of the PC sites were incorporated in the following constructs: mouse full-length ADAM17 WT cDNA (with a C-terminal Myc tag (EQKLISEEDL)) was cloned into pSECtag. Mutagenic primers were incorporated into the mouse full-length ADAM17 WT with restriction-free PCR cloning (26.van den Ent F. Löwe J. RF cloning: a restriction-free method for inserting target genes into plasmids.J. Biochem. Biophys. Methods. 2006; 67: 67-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). Mutations in ADAM9 as well as in ADAM10 (with a C-terminal HA tag (YPYDVPDYA)) were incorporated by Transfer PCR as previously described (27.Erijman A. Dantes A. Bernheim R. Shifman J.M. Peleg Y. Transfer-PCR (TPCR): a highway for DNA cloning and protein engineering.J. Struct. Biol. 2011; 175: 171-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). All sequences were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Shedding experiments were performed in Adam17−/− MEFs or Adam10/17−/− MEFs generated from knock-out mice, as previously described (28.Sahin U. Weskamp G. Kelly K. Zhou H.M. Higashiyama S. Peschon J.

Double knock out Adam10/17−/− MEFs were derived from E9.5 embryos. Plasmids encoding AP-tagged substrates were constructed by inserting partial cDNAs for human transforming growth factor (TGF) α, betacellulin (BTC), or EphB4 into the 3′ end of human placental AP cDNA on a pRc/CMV-based expression vector pAlPh. AP-TGFα was co-transfected with ADAM17 WT or mutants into Adam17−/− MEFs. AP-BTC was co-transfected with ADAM10 WT or mutants into Adam10/17−/− MEFs. AP-EphB4 was co-transfected with ADAM9 WT or mutants into Adam10/17−/− MEFs. All cells were transfected with LipofectamineTM (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer's instructions. Fresh Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) was added after 12 h, incubated for 1 h, and then replaced with Opti-MEM containing either 20 ng/ml of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate or 2.5 μm ionomycin, which was collected after 1 h. Evaluation of AP activity by colorimetric assays was performed as described previously (29.Zheng Y. Schlondorff J. Blobel C.P.

HEK293 cells were grown in Nunc six-well plates and cultured in DMEM containing penicillin-streptomycin and 10% FBS, 37 °C, and 5% CO2 to ∼80% confluence. Mouse full-length ADAM17 WT and mutants, mouse full-length ADAM10 WT and mutants, and mouse full-length ADAM9 WT and mutants were transfected with jetPEI® reagent (PolyPlus) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were harvested after overnight incubation and cell surface biotinylation was performed with a Cell Surface Protein Isolation Kit (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions with minor adjustments. For cell lysis, MMP inhibitors (1 μm marimastat and 10 mm 1,10-phenanthroline) and EDTA-free complete Protease Inhibitor Mixture (Roche) were added to the lysis buffer to prevent autodegradation of the mature form of ADAM17 (30.Schlöndorff J.

ADAM10 samples were probed with rabbit anti-HA (Santa Cruz) and ADAM9 samples were probed with rabbit anti-ADAM9 antibodies (32.Weskamp G. Krätzschmar J. Reid M.S. Blobel C.P.

A horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (Santa Cruz) was used as a secondary antibody. Signal was detected with ECL (Pierce). The cell surface fraction blots were quantified using ImageJ to calculate the ratio between the pro- and mature forms. The codon usage of WT human ADAM17 proenzyme DNA (pro-domain and catalytic domain Δ-signal sequence- Asp23–Val477) was optimized for expression in E. coli by GeneArt. The ADAM17 proenzyme was cloned into pET28 with an N-terminal His tag followed by the tobacco etch virus cleavage site SAGENLYFQGT. Mutations in the upstream site mutant (US), the boundary site mutant (BS), the double US/BS mutant (2M), and the inactivating EA mutant in the catalytic site together with the BS mutant (EA/BS) were introduced by PCR mutagenesis with the pET28 WT ADAM17 proenzyme as a template. Sequences were confirmed by DNA sequencing. ADAM17 proenzyme WT and mutants were expressed and purified according to the following procedure. Electrocompetent bacteria (E. coli BL21(DE3)) were transformed with the corresponding ADAM17 proenzyme plasmid and plated on LB plates containing 30 μg/ml of kanamycin. After overnight incubation at 37 °C, single colonies were selected and cultured in 10 ml of LB medium with 30 μg/ml of kanamycin overnight at 37 °C. These cultures were added to 1 liter of LB medium containing 30 μg/ml of kanamycin, and protein expression was induced with 200 μm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside when the optical density of the culture reached 0.6. Immediately after induction, cells continued to grow at 15 °C overnight. Cells were harvested by centrifugation for 20 min at 5000 rpm. The pellets were resuspended with 100 ml of 50 mm Tris, 300 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, 0.1 mg/ml of lysozyme, 1 μg/ml of DNase, and one tablet of protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics), pH 8. The resuspended pellets were sonicated and centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 45 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was applied to a 5-ml Ni2+ column (GE Healthcare). The column was washed with 10 times bed volume of buffer containing 50 mm Tris, 300 mm NaCl, and 20 mm imidazole, pH 8. The protein was eluted with buffer containing 50 mm Tris, 300 mm NaCl, and 250 mm imidazole, pH 8. The eluted protein was dialyzed against 50 mm Tris, pH 8, at 4 °C overnight. Following dialysis, the protein was applied to a HiTrap Q HP column (GE Healthcare). The column was washed with 10 times bed volume of 50 mm Tris, pH 8, and eluted with a salt gradient starting from 0 m NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 8, to 1 m NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 8, in 5 ml/min for 10 min. Fractions were collected and analyzed by 15% SDS-PAGE. The fractions containing the ADAM17 proenzyme WT or mutants were collected and concentrated using a Vivaspin concentrator with a molecular mass cutoff of 10 kDa to 1 mg/ml concentration. The protein concentration was determined using the extinction coefficient of 51760 cm−1 m−1. CD measurements were performed using an Aviv 202 spectropolarimeter with a 1-mm path length quartz cuvette at 25 °C. Wavelength scans were done in the 190–260-nm far-ultraviolet range. The CD spectra of ADAM17 proenzyme WT and mutants were recorded at a concentration of 0.1 mg/ml in 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris buffer, pH 8, at 2 s/nm. Data sets were averaged and then normalized to the baseline at 255 nm. Purified ADAM17 proenzymes including WT, US, BS, 2M, and EA/BS mutants (0.2 mg/ml final concentration) were incubated with Furin (2 enzyme units, New England Biolab) in Furin assay buffer (100 mm HEPES, pH 7.5), 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol) at 37 °C for 3 h. 10 μl of each reaction was separated on a 12% SDS-PAGE and stained with 12% basic native gel stain Coomassie Blue solution. In addition, the catalytic activity of ADAM17 (10 nm) was measured by hydrolytic processing of the fluorogenic substrate Mca-PLAGAV-Dpa-RSSSR by monitoring the increasing fluorescence intensity at λex = 340 nm and λem = 380 nm for 40 min at 37 °C with a SynergyTM HT plate reader (BioTek). All reactions were performed in a fluorogenic buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.05% Brij-35. Purified ADAM17 proenzyme WT and mutants were treated with Furin as described above and products were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a PVDF membrane. The different bands were excised from the membrane and N-terminal sequence analysis was performed using a Procise 492 Protein Sequencer (Applied Biosystems, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Data were assumed to meet normal distribution. The variance between groups that were statistically compared was similar. All data were expressed as mean ± S.D. p values were generated using two-tailed Student's t test (*, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01; ***, p < 0.001). All statistical analyses were performed with Microsoft Excel software. Many enzymes, including ADAMs, are synthesized as inactive proenzymes that undergo post-translational processing to become biologically active. In mammals, the PC family and specifically Furin has been shown to be responsible for the maturation of members of the ADAM family by processing at a PC consensus site at the boundary between the catalytic domain and the autoinhibitory pro-domain. To identify additional potential cleavage sites for PCs in the pro-domains of ADAMs, we subjected the sequences of different ADAMs to a proprotein convertase cleavage site prediction program (ProP server (24.Duckert P. Brunak S. Blom N. Prediction of proprotein convertase cleavage sites.Protein Eng. Des. Sel. 2004; 17: 107-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar)), which predicts PC cleavage sites based on artificial neural networks. In addition, the sequences were analyzed with disorder prediction by the Disopred server (25.Ward J.J. Sodhi J.S. McGuffin L.J. Buxton B.F. Jones D.T. Prediction and functional analysis of native disorder in proteins from the three kingdoms of life.J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 337: 635-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (1608) Google Scholar) to provide information regarding the sequence properties of the PC cleavage sites. This analysis predicted two distinct PC sites in the pro-domains of ADAM8, -9, -10, -11, and -17 (Fig. 1, A–E). The first predicted site was the classical putative boundary PC site between the pro- and the catalytic domain (Fig. 1F): ADAM8-RETR196/Y197, ADAM9-RRRR205/A206, ADAM10-RKKR214/T215, ADAM11-RRKR229/Q230, and ADAM17-RVKR214/R215. Although ADAM pro-domains share low sequence homology, the second predicted site was located in the same region upstream to the boundary site (Fig. 1F): ADAM8-RVRR42/A43, ADAM9-RERR56/E57, ADAM10-RAKR51/A52, ADAM11-RLVR55/Q56, and ADAM17-RKR58/D59. In addition, the putative upstream PC cleavage site appeared to be located in a disorder"

Fusing intestinal lamina propria lymphocytes from mice monocolonized with Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron to a myeloma fusion partner allowed us to recover hybridomas that captured naturally primed, antigen-specific antibody responses representing multiple isotypes, including IgA. One of these hybridomas, 260.8, produced a monoclonal antibody that recognizes an epitope specific for B. thetaiotaomicron isolates in a large panel of hospital- and community-acquired Bacteroides. Whole genome transposon mutagenesis revealed a 19-gene locus, involved in LPS O-antigen polysaccharide synthesis and conserved among multiple B. thetaiotaomicron isolates, that is required for 260.8 epitope expression. Mutants in this locus exhibited marked fitness defects in vitro during growth in rich medium and in gnotobiotic mice colonized with defined communities of human gut symbionts. Expression of the 260.8 epitope was sustained during 10 months of daily passage in vitro and during 14 months of monocolonization of gnotobiotic wild-type, Rag1−/−, or Myd88−/− mice. Comparison of gnotobiotic Rag1−/− mice with and without subcutaneous 260.8 hybridomas disclosed that this IgA did not affect B. thetaiotaomicron population density or suppress 260.8 epitope production but did affect bacterial gene expression in ways emblematic of a diminished host innate immune response. Our study illustrates an approach for (i) generating diagnostic antibodies, (ii) characterizing IgA responses along a continuum of specificity/degeneracy that defines the IgA repertoire to gut symbionts, and (iii) identifying immunogenic epitopes that affect competitiveness and help maintain host-microbe mutualism.

https://openalex.org/W2140422735,"Seasonally dry tropical plant formations (SDTF) are likely to exhibit phylogenetic clustering owing to niche conservatism driven by a strong environmental filter (water stress), but heterogeneous edaphic environments and life histories may result in heterogeneity in degree of phylogenetic clustering. We investigated phylogenetic patterns across ecological gradients related to water availability (edaphic environment and climate) in the Caatinga, a SDTF in Brazil. Caatinga is characterized by semiarid climate and three distinct edaphic environments – sedimentary, crystalline, and inselberg –representing a decreasing gradient in soil water availability. We used two measures of phylogenetic diversity: Net Relatedness Index based on the entire phylogeny among species present in a site, reflecting long-term diversification; and Nearest Taxon Index based on the tips of the phylogeny, reflecting more recent diversification. We also evaluated woody species in contrast to herbaceous species. The main climatic variable influencing phylogenetic pattern was precipitation in the driest quarter, particularly for herbaceous species, suggesting that environmental filtering related to minimal periods of precipitation is an important driver of Caatinga biodiversity, as one might expect for a SDTF. Woody species tended to show phylogenetic clustering whereas herbaceous species tended towards phylogenetic overdispersion. We also found phylogenetic clustering in two edaphic environments (sedimentary and crystalline) in contrast to phylogenetic overdispersion in the third (inselberg). We conclude that while niche conservatism is evident in phylogenetic clustering in the Caatinga, this is not a universal pattern likely due to heterogeneity in the degree of realized environmental filtering across edaphic environments. Thus, SDTF, in spite of a strong shared environmental filter, are potentially heterogeneous in phylogenetic structuring. Our results support the need for scientifically informed conservation strategies in the Caatinga and other SDTF regions that have not previously been prioritized for conservation in order to take into account this heterogeneity."

Conclusion: Prostacyclin therapy diminishes demyelination and neuronal deficits in pathophysiological conditions. Significance: This study provides the first evidence that pericyte protection contributes to attenuate disease progression in adult CNS. Vascular barrier dysfunction is a major anatomical feature in central nervous system (CNS) diseases, including multiple sclerosis, stroke, epilepsy, familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (1.Obermeier B. Daneman R. Ransohoff R.M. Development, maintenance and disruption of the blood-brain barrier.Nat. Med. 2013; 19: 1584-1596Crossref PubMed Scopus (1345) Google Scholar), and brain tumors (2.Fortin D. The blood-brain barrier: its influence in the treatment of brain tumors metastases.Curr. Cancer Drug Targets. 2012; 12: 247-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Because of an increase in vascular permeability, the CNS receives an influx of neurotoxic hemoglobin-derived products (3.Rosenberg G.A. Neurological diseases in relation to the blood-brain barrier.J. Cerebral. Blood Flow Metab. 2012; 32: 1139-1151Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Maintaining the integrity of the vascular barrier is therefore considered necessary for protection against expanding and exacerbating damage in CNS diseases (4.Shlosberg D. Benifla M. Kaufer D. Friedman A. Blood-brain barrier breakdown as a therapeutic target in traumatic brain injury.Nat. Rev. Neurol. 2010; 6: 393-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar). Although interendothelial contact is the principal cellular element of the vascular barrier, the formation and regulation of vascular barrier integrity appear to require cell-cell interactions in the vasculature. Vascular mural cells, or pericytes, make specific focal contacts with the endothelium within the microvasculature and have been recently highlighted as potentially contributing to vascular barrier integrity (5.Winkler E.A. Bell R.D. Zlokovic B.V. Central nervous system pericytes in health and disease.Nat. Neurosci. 2011; 14: 1398-1405Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). Studies using mice with genetically deficient pericytes demonstrate that they are the major cell type that forms and maintains the vascular barrier during development (6.Daneman R. Zhou L. Kebede A.A. Barres B.A. Pericytes are required for blood-brain barrier integrity during embryogenesis.Nature. 2010; 468: 562-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (1360) Google Scholar) and adulthood (7.Armulik A. Genové G. Mäe M. Nisancioglu M.H. Wallgard E. Niaudet C. He L. Norlin J. Lindblom P. Strittmatter K. Johansson B.R. Betsholtz C. Pericytes regulate the blood-brain barrier.Nature. 2010; 468: 557-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (1752) Google Scholar). Moreover, age-related pericyte loss is closely associated with the progression of neurodegeneration and neuronal dysfunction (8.Bell R.D. Winkler E.A. Sagare A.P. Singh I. LaRue B. Deane R. Zlokovic B.V. Pericytes control key neurovascular functions and neuronal phenotype in the adult brain and during brain aging.Neuron. 2010; 68: 409-427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (994) Google Scholar). These observations raise an interesting hypothesis that pericytes protect the CNS from damage resulting from disruption of the vascular barrier. However, direct evidence supporting or disputing this is lacking. Prostacyclin (prostaglandin I2) is a metabolite of arachidonic acid or prostaglandin endoperoxides and is released from vascular endothelial cells (9.Vane J.R. Botting R.M. Pharmacodynamic profile of prostacyclin.Am. J. Cardiol. 1995; 75: 3A-10AAbstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). The I-type prostaglandin receptor (IP 3The abbreviations used are: IPI type prostacyclinBBBblood-brain barrierLPClysophosphatidylcholinePDGFRplatelet-derived growth factor receptorRPMIRoswell park memorial institutePFAparaformaldehydeTuj1class III β-tubulinMBPmyelin basic proteinTEERtrans-endothelial electric resistanceLFBluxol fast blueGPRG protein-coupled receptorNSnot significant. receptor) is a G protein-coupled receptor that is primarily coupled to the activation of adenylate cyclase, which catalyzes the formation of 3′,5′ cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) (9.Vane J.R. Botting R.M. Pharmacodynamic profile of prostacyclin.Am. J. Cardiol. 1995; 75: 3A-10AAbstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar), an enhancer of vascular barrier integrity (10.Huber J.D. Egleton R.D. Davis T.P. Molecular physiology and pathophysiology of tight junctions in the blood-brain barrier.Trends Neurosci. 2001; 24: 719-725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar). Expression of the IP receptor is reported on vascular smooth muscle and platelets and is involved in both vasorelaxants on smooth muscle and inhibition of platelet aggregation. Some drugs that target prostacyclin signaling have been approved for treatment of peripheral vascular diseases, including pulmonary arterial hypertension and arterial thrombosis. Concerning the role of prostacyclin in vascular barrier integrity, there have been no reports that disrupting either prostacyclin or the IP receptor gene in mice leads to an abnormal vascular barrier. However, studies under pathological conditions reveal that after occlusion of the middle cerebral artery, a stable analog of prostacyclin inhibits brain edema that increases vascular permeability (11.Terawaki T. Takakuwa T. Iguchi S. Wakitani K. Kira H. Okegawa T. Kawasaki A. Masuda Y. Effect of a prostacyclin analog OP-2507 on acute ischemic cerebral edema in cats.Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1988; 152: 63-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). One possible hypothesis for reducing edema formation with a prostacyclin analog is that prostacyclin signaling directly acts on endothelial cells and enhances endothelial barrier function (12.Birukova A.A. Wu T. Tian Y. Meliton A. Sarich N. Tian X. Leff A. Birukov K.G. Iloprost improves endothelial barrier function in lipopolysaccharide-induced lung injury.Eur. Respir. J. 2013; 41: 165-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Moreover, it is known that vasodilatation is the result of relaxation of perivascular cells (e.g. vascular smooth muscle cells) wrapped around the endothelium. Therefore, perivascular cell activation by prostacyclin may also be involved in reducing edema formation. These observations prompted us to hypothesize that prostacyclin signaling in perivascular cells, such as pericytes, contributes to reducing capillary hydraulic permeability under pathological conditions in the adult CNS.

Lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) is a bioactive proinflammatory lipid generated by hydrolysis of phosphatidylcholine via the action of phospholipase A2. The majority of LPC formed in tissue is normally metabolized or reacetylated; however, overstimulation of phospholipase A2 results in phosphatidylcholine breakdown and subsequent accumulation of LPC in the damaged tissue (13.Sevastou I. Kaffe E. Mouratis M.A. Aidinis V. Lysoglycerophospholipids in chronic inflammatory disorders: the PLA2/LPC and ATX/LPA axes.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2013; 1831: 42-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Thus, accumulation of LPC is a recognized hallmark of pathological conditions and exacerbates pathological features. In the pathologically affected CNS, LPC production has been revealed by imaging mass spectrometry of experimental ischemic brain injury (14.Koizumi S. Yamamoto S. Hayasaka T. Konishi Y. Yamaguchi-Okada M. Goto-Inoue N. Sugiura Y. Setou M. Namba H. Imaging mass spectrometry revealed the production of lyso-phosphatidylcholine in the injured ischemic rat brain.Neuroscience. 2010; 168: 219-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Experimental accumulation of LPC into the CNS is known to cause neurodegeneration, which is characterized by demyelination (15.Aguirre A. Dupree J.L. Mangin J.M. Gallo V. A functional role for EGFR signaling in myelination and remyelination.Nat. Neurosci. 2007; 10: 990-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 16.Bai L. Lennon D.P. Caplan A.I. DeChant A.

Neurosci. 2012; 15: 862-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Demyelination by LPC is understood to occur by phagocytosis (17.Ousman S.S. David S. Lysophosphatidylcholine induces rapid recruitment and activation of macrophages in the adult mouse spinal cord.Glia. 2000; 30: 92-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) and direct changes of myelin-associated protein expression (18.Mozafari S. Sherafat M.A. Javan M. Mirnajafi-Zadeh J. Tiraihi T. Visual evoked potentials and MBP gene expression imply endogenous myelin repair in adult rat optic nerve and chiasm following local lysolecithin induced demyelination.Brain Res. 2010; 1351: 50-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar); however, other possible mechanisms have not been fully elucidated. By studying the mouse spinal cord, we show that prostacyclin protects against LPC-mediated pericyte damage following vascular barrier dysfunction in the adult CNS. Intrathecal administration of a prostacyclin analog attenuates demyelination and motor deficits induced by LPC. C57BL/6J mice and Wistar rats were obtained from Charles River Japan or Japan SLC. All experimental procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Osaka University. Brain pericytes were prepared from cerebral cortices obtained from female rats 3 weeks postnatally as described previously with modifications (19.Tigges U. Welser-Alves J.V. Boroujerdi A. Milner R. A novel and simple method for culturing pericytes from mouse brain.Microvasc. Res. 2012; 84: 74-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The cerebral cortices were digested in a mixture of 1 mg/ml collagenase type 2 (Worthington) and 6.7 μg/ml DNase (Sigma) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) for 90 min at 37 °C. The cell pellet was separated by centrifugation in 20% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (BSA)/DMEM (1000 × g, 10 min) and then incubated for another 45 min at 37 °C with a mixture of 1 mg/ml collagenase-dispase (Roche Applied Science) and 6.7 μg/ml DNase in DMEM at 37 °C. Brain capillaries were centrifuged on a 33% continuous Percoll gradient (GE Healthcare) (1000 × g, 10 min) and plated on culture dishes coated with 0.1 mg/ml collagen type IV and 0.1 mg/ml fibronectin. Cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS). To purify vascular endothelial cells from a mixed cell population, cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS and 4 μg/ml puromycin (Sigma). Attached cells were identified as vascular endothelial cells. To purify pericytes from a mixed cell population, cells were detached with 0.25% trypsin solution and transferred to noncoated culture dishes. Attached cells were immunocytochemically identified as pericytes. The purity of the pericytes was calculated as the ratio of the number of platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) β and 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, Sigma) double-positive cells to the total number of DAPI+ cells in culture (91.2 ± 0.09%). Cortical neurons were prepared from cerebral cortices of postnatal day 1 Wistar rats. The cerebral cortices were digested in a mixture of 0.25% trypsin (Gibco) and DNase in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 15 min at 37 °C followed by resuspension in DMEM containing 10% FBS. The cells were passed through 70-μm nylon mesh and were collected by centrifugation (300 × g, 5 min). The cells were resuspended with DMEM containing 10% FBS and were plated on poly-l-lysine (Sigma)- precoated Lab-Tek 4-well chamber slides (Nalge Nunc International) at a density of 1 × 106 cells/well. Microglia and oligodendrocytes were obtained from the brain of the postnatal day 1 rat or mouse. The tissues were digested in a mixture of 0.25% trypsin in PBS for 15 min at 37 °C followed by resuspension in DMEM containing 10% FBS. The isolated cells were plated on poly-l-lysine-precoated culture dishes in DMEM containing 10% FBS. One week after culturing, the dishes were rotated 20 times, and microglia were detached from the cell layer following centrifugation (300 × g, 5 min). Cell suspension was diluted with DMEM containing 10% FBS and plated on poly-l-lysine-precoated Lab-Tek 4-well chamber slides at a density of 5 × 104 cells/well. To prepare oligodendrocytes, the remnant cells on the dishes were treated with 0.05% trypsin in PBS for 3 min at 36 °C followed by resuspension in DMEM containing 10% FBS. Detached cells were collected and passed through 40-μm nylon mesh and were collected by centrifugation (300 × g, 5 min). Cells were plated a density of precoated Lab-Tek 4-well chamber slides at a density of 1 × 105 cells/well in DMEM containing 4 mm l-glutamine (MP Biomedicals), 1 mm sodium pyruvate (Sigma), 0.1% BSA, 50 mg/ml apo-transferrin (Sigma), 5 mg/ml insulin (Sigma), 30 nm sodium selenite (Sigma), 10 nm biotin (Sigma), 10 nm hydrocortisone (Sigma), 10 ng/ml platelet-derived growth factor-AA (PeproTech), and 10 ng/ml basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF) (PeproTech). After 72 h of culturing, one-half of the medium was changed to DMEM containing 4 mm l-glutamine, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 0.1% BSA, 50 mg/ml apo-transferrin, 5 mg/ml insulin, 30 nm sodium selenite, 10 nm biotin, 10 nm hydrocortisone, and 30 ng/ml T3 (Sigma). Cells were additionally cultured for 48 h. Macrophages were prepared from bone marrow of adult mice (female, 8 weeks). Collected bone marrow cells were cultured in Roswell Park Memorial Institute 1640 medium containing 10% FBS and 50 ng/ml macrophage colony-stimulating factor (Sigma). After 1 day of cultivation, we used the cells for phagocytosis assay. After 24 h of culturing, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS for 30 min at room temperature. After washing in PBS, cells were incubated with PBS containing 1% Triton X-100 and 5% BSA for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were incubated with primary antibodies for 2 h at room temperature and then incubated with fluorescently labeled secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature. The primary antibodies used were as follows: rabbit anti-mouse IP receptor (Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI, catalog no. 160070, RRID, AB_10079417); goat anti-mouse CD13 (pericyte marker, 1:100, R&D Systems, catalog no.

Cells were incubated in the following secondary antibodies: Alexa Fluor 488 and Alexa Fluor 568 conjugated to isotype-specific antibodies (1:500, Invitrogen); streptavidin-conjugated Alexa Fluor 488 (1:500, Invitrogen). Nuclei were stained with a solution of DAPI at a final concentration of 1 μg/ml in PBS for 30 min at room temperature. We used an in vitro BBB kit (PharmaCo-cell, catalog no. RBT-12), which is composed of rat brain vascular endothelial cells, pericytes, and astrocytes (20.Nakagawa S. Deli M.A. Kawaguchi H. Shimizudani T. Shimono T. Kittel A. Tanaka K. Niwa M. A new blood-brain barrier model using primary rat brain endothelial cells, pericytes and astrocytes.Neurochem. Int. 2009; 54: 253-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar). To assess the vascular integrity, we measured the transendothelial electric resistance (TEER) across the upper and lower transwell chambers using ERS-2 (Millipore). Values are expressed as ω × cm2 and were calculated by the formula: average resistance of experimental wells − average resistance of blank wells × 0.33 (area of the transwell membrane). Relative values were calculated relative to the TEER of the control at 0 h. To assess the effect of endothelial cells on the TEER value, we seeded vascular endothelial cells at a density of 1 × 105 cells/insert on the polyethylene terephthalate membrane Millicell® insert (pore size 3 μm). Cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS and 4 μg/ml puromycin. Cultures were fixed with 4% PFA in PBS for 30 min at room temperature. Nuclei were stained with a solution of DAPI at a final concentration of 1 μg/ml in PBS for 30 min at room temperature. For observation, cells on the opposite surface of transwell filters were removed by wiping with cotton swabs. Images were captured with an upright microscope using a ×20 objective (Olympus) and analyzed using a DP-controller image system (Olympus). We determined the number of DAPI+ cells on the upper surface of transwell (endothelial cell), the lower surface of transwell (pericyte), or the bottom of the culture plates (astrocyte). We calculated the average cell number from six fields per sample. Anesthetized mice were subjected to laminectomy at thoracic level Th8 and injected with 2 μl of 1% (w/v) LPC (Sigma) dissolved in PBS over a 1-min period (0.5 mm, depth at the midline) into the dorsal column of the thoracic spinal cord. Pharmacological treatment started immediately after LPC injection. For administration of pharmacological reagents, an osmotic pump (model no. 1007D; ALZET Corp) was filled with vehicle solution (saline) or iloprost (20 mg/kg/day, Cayman Chemical). The delivery tube connected to an osmotic pump was placed close to the lesion just after LPC injection. The pump was implanted subcutaneously in the dorsal skin. One day after operation, mice were transcardially perfused with 4% PFA in PBS, and the spinal cords were postfixed for 24 h at 4 °C, followed by immersion in 30% sucrose/PBS for 24 h at 4 °C. Because the pericyte coverage varies depending on the level of the spinal cord (21.Winkler E.A. Sengillo J.D. Bell R.D. Wang J. Zlokovic B.V. Blood-spinal cord barrier pericyte reductions contribute to increased capillary permeability.J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 2012; 32: 1841-1852Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), we carefully dissected the spinal cord from one segment rostral to one segment caudal to the lesion center (Th7-9). Spinal cord tissue was embedded in Tissue-Tek OCT compound (Sakura Finetek) and stored at −80 °C. We prepared cryosections of 30-μm in thickness and mounted them on adhesive silane-coated slides (Matsunami Glass). Sections were dried in air at room temperature for 1 h. After washing in PBS, sections were incubated with PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and 10% swine serum (Vector Laboratories) for 1 h at room temperature. The sections were incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C and then incubated with fluorescent secondary antibodies for 2 h at room temperature. Th following antibodies were used: goat anti-mouse CD13 antibody (1:100; R&D Systems, catalog no. AF2335); rabbit anti-mouse CD31 (vascular endothelial cell marker, 1:100, Abcam, catalog no. ab28364); Alexa Fluor 488 and Alexa Fluor 568 conjugated to isotype-specific antibodies (1:500, Invitrogen); and streptavidin-conjugated Alexa Fluor 488 (1:500, Invitrogen). In a separate set of studies, cryosections of 30 μm in thickness were blocked and permeabilized with 10% swine serum containing 0.1% Triton X-100. Sections were incubated with antibodies against rabbit anti-mouse cleaved caspase-3 and biotinylated anti-mouse PDGDRβ overnight at 4 °C and then incubated with Alexa Fluor 568 conjugated to anti-rabbit IgG (1:500, Invitrogen) and streptavidin-conjugated Alexa Fluor 488 (1:500, Invitrogen). To visualize vascular endothelial cells using lectin, sections were incubated with DyLight 594-labeled Lycopersicon esculentum (tomato) lectin (vascular endothelial cell marker, 1:100; Vector Laboratories, catalog no. DL-1177) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The length of lectin+ vasculature in the dorsal column of the spinal cord was measured using ImageJ software. The average length was calculated from three sections per sample. To evaluate the pericyte coverage of endothelial cells, the CD13- or PDGFRβ-positive area in the dorsal column of spinal cord was determined using the ImageJ area measurement tool and divided by the lectin-positive capillary area (20.Nakagawa S. Deli M.A. Kawaguchi H. Shimizudani T. Shimono T. Kittel A. Tanaka K. Niwa M. A new blood-brain barrier model using primary rat brain endothelial cells, pericytes and astrocytes.Neurochem. Int. 2009; 54: 253-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar). The average ratio was calculated from three sections per sample. To evaluate the pericyte damage, the number of cleaved caspase-3/PDGFRβ double-positive cells was counted and divided by the number of PDGFRβ-positive cells. We calculated the average length from three sections per sample. The tissues or cells were homogenized in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS) containing protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). The lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 13,000 × g at 4 °C for 20 min, and the supernatants were collected and normalized for protein concentration. Proteins were separated by 8% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon-P, Millipore). After blocking with PBS containing 5% skim milk and 0.05% Tween 20, the membranes were incubated with primary antibodies. For detection, a fluorescence-conjugated secondary antibody and an electrogenerated chemiluminescence system (GE Healthcare) were used. The membrane was exposed to an imaging system (LAS-3000, Fujifilm) according to the manufacturer's specifications. The protein bands were quantified using ImageJ 1.44p software. The following antibodies were used: mouse anti-α-tubulin (1:1000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, catalog no. sc-5286); rabbit anti-occludin (1:1000, Invitrogen, catalog no. 71-1500); mouse anti-ZO-1 (1:1000, Invitrogen, catalog no. 33-9100); and mouse anti-claudin-5 (1:1000, Invitrogen, catalog no. 35-2500). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated mouse IgG-specific (1:5000, Cell Signaling Technology, catalog no.7076S) and rabbit IgG-specific (1:5000, Cell Signaling Technology, catalog no.7074S) were used for secondary antibodies. Evans blue dye (2% in saline, 4 ml/kg; Sigma) was injected intravenously into the tail vein in adult mice under anesthesia. One hour after the injection, mice were transcardially perfused with saline to remove the intravascular dye. The spinal cord tissues (Th7-9) was removed and weighed for quantitative measurement of Evans blue extravasation. Evans blue dye was extracted by incubating tissues in 1 ml of formamide (Sigma) for 48 h at room temperature. The level of Evans blue was quantified using a light absorbance at a wavelength of 620 nm. Mice were transcardially perfused with 4% PFA/PBS. Spinal cord tissues were immersed in 30% sucrose/PBS overnight at 4 °C. Cryosections (30-μm thickness) were mounted on slides and permeabilized in PBS containing 1% Triton X-100 and 5% BSA for 1 h at room temperature. Sections were incubated with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:500, Invitrogen, catalog no. A-11001) and DyLight 594-labeled L. esculentum (tomato) lectin (1:100) for 1 h at room temperature. Mice were intravenously injected with 0.1 ml of Alexa Fluor 555-conjugated cadaverine at a concentration of 0.5 mg/ml (Life Technologies, Inc.) under anesthesia. Two hours after the injection, mice were transcardially perfused with saline to remove the intravascular dye. Mice were subsequently perfused with 4% PFA in PBS, and the spinal cords were postfixed for 24 h at 4 °C. Low magnification images of cadaverine leakage were obtained using fluorescent microscopy (SZX-16, Olympus). To observe cadaverin leakages under high magnification, tissues were immersed in 30% sucrose/PBS for 24 h at 4 °C and embedded in Tissue-Tek OCT compound. We prepared cryosections with a thickness of 30 μm and performed immunohistochemical analysis using a rabbit anti-mouse CD31 antibody (1:100, Abcam, catalog no. ab28364). One day after the operation, mice were perfused with Bouin fixture containing 9% PFA and 7% picric acid. The spinal cord tissues were removed and postfixed with Bouin solution for 2 h. The samples were washed in 70% ethanol, followed by decolorization with 70% ethanol containing lithium carbonate. Subsequently, the samples were dehydrated in an ascending ethanol series and then embedded in paraffin (tissue preparation, T580, FALMA) through Clear Plus (FALMA). The paraffin-embedded tissues were cut into 7-μm-thick sections using a microtome (RM2145, Leica), and sections were mounted on glass slides. After deparaffinization using Clear Plus, the slides were stained with 0.1% luxol fast blue (LFB) in distilled water at 60 °C overnight. The slides were decolorized using both 0.05% lithium carbonate in distilled water and 70% ethanol, followed by Nissl staining with 0.1% LFB in distilled water. After dehydration, coverslips were placed on slides and sealed with Entellan (Merck). All samples were analyzed using a light microscope (BX61; Olympus). The demyelinated area was calculated by subtracting the blue area from the total area in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord using ImageJ 1.44p software. The average demyelinated area was calculated from five samples per groups. Recovery of hindlimb motor function was scored by the Basso Mouse Scale open-field locomotor rating scale, which was developed specifically for mice, and it results in scores ranging from 0 (complete paralysis) to 9 (normal mobility) (22.Basso D.M. Fisher L.C. Anderson A.J. Jakeman L.B. McTigue D.M. Popovich P.G. Basso Mouse Scale for locomotion detects differences in recovery after spinal cord injury in five common mouse strains.J. Neurotrauma. 2006; 23: 635-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (1031) Google Scholar). The number of errors at each footstep was measured during 100 steps. Mice were observed individually for 2 min in an open field. Mice were allowed to freely explore the open field. In total, 50 steps were video recorded for each hindlimb (23.Jeffery N.D. Blakemore W.F. Locomotor deficits induced by experimental spinal cord demyelination are abolished by spontaneous remyelination.Brain. 1997; 120: 27-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Scores were given to every step according to the flowing scheme: 0, normal step; 1, minor error (slight insecurity of foot placement); 2, major error (foot slipped completely from beam surface). The behavioral score is defined as the sum of the score of 50 steps. Phagocytosis activity was evaluated using a phagocytosis assa"
https://openalex.org/W1983495573,"We sought to determine the mechanisms by which influenza infection of human epithelial cells decreases cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) expression and function. We infected human bronchial epithelial (NHBE) cells and murine nasal epithelial (MNE) cells with various strains of influenza A virus. Influenza infection significantly reduced CFTR short circuit currents (Isc) and protein levels at 8 hours postinfection. We then infected CFTR expressing human embryonic kidney (HEK)-293 cells (HEK-293 CFTRwt) with influenza virus encoding a green fluorescent protein (GFP) tag and performed whole-cell and cell-attached patch clamp recordings. Forskolin-stimulated, GlyH-101-sensitive CFTR conductances, and CFTR open probabilities were reduced by 80% in GFP-positive cells; Western blots also showed significant reduction in total and plasma membrane CFTR levels. Knockdown of the influenza matrix protein 2 (M2) with siRNA, or inhibition of its activity by amantadine, prevented the decrease in CFTR expression and function. Lysosome inhibition (bafilomycin-A1), but not proteasome inhibition (lactacystin), prevented the reduction in CFTR levels. Western blots of immunoprecipitated CFTR from influenza-infected cells, treated with BafA1, and probed with antibodies against lysine 63-linked (K-63) or lysine 48-linked (K-48) polyubiquitin chains supported lysosomal targeting. These results highlight CFTR damage, leading to early degradation as an important contributing factor to influenza infection-associated ion transport defects.—Londino, J. D., Lazrak, A., Noah, J.

https://openalex.org/W1995564977,"Abstract The RET proto-oncogene, a tyrosine kinase receptor, is widely known for its essential role in cell survival. Germ line missense mutations, which give rise to constitutively active oncogenic RET, were found to cause multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2, a dominant inherited cancer syndrome that affects neuroendocrine organs. However, the mechanisms by which RET promotes cell survival and prevents cell death remain elusive. We demonstrate that in addition to cytoplasmic localization, RET is localized in the nucleus and functions as a tyrosine-threonine dual specificity kinase. Knockdown of RET by shRNA in medullary thyroid cancer-derived cells stimulated expression of activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4), a master transcription factor for stress-induced apoptosis, through activation of its target proapoptotic genes NOXA and PUMA. RET knockdown also increased sensitivity to cisplatin-induced apoptosis. We observed that RET physically interacted with and phosphorylated ATF4 at tyrosine and threonine residues. Indeed, RET kinase activity was required to inhibit the ATF4-dependent activation of the NOXA gene because the site-specific substitution mutations that block threonine phosphorylation increased ATF4 stability and activated its targets NOXA and PUMA. Moreover, chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed that ATF4 occupancy increased at the NOXA promoter in TT cells treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors or the ATF4 inducer eeyarestatin as well as in RET-depleted TT cells. Together these findings reveal RET as a novel dual kinase with nuclear localization and provide mechanisms by which RET represses the proapoptotic genes through direct interaction with and phosphorylation-dependent inactivation of ATF4 during the pathogenesis of medullary thyroid cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2076760445,"Breastfeeding has been linked to a reduction in the prevalence of allergy and asthma. However, studies on this relationship vary in outcome, which may partly be related to differences in breast milk composition. In particular breast milk composition may differ between allergic and non-allergic mothers. Important components that may be involved are breast milk proteins, as these are known to regulate immune development in the newborn. The objective of this study was therefore to explore differences in the proteins of breast milk from 20 allergic and non-allergic mothers. The results from this comparison may then be used to generate hypotheses on proteins associated with allergy in their offspring.Milk samples from allergic and non-allergic mothers were obtained from the PIAMA project, a prospective birth cohort study on incidence, risk factors, and prevention of asthma and inhalant allergy. Non-targeted proteomics technology, based on liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry, was used to compare breast milk from allergic and non-allergic mothers.Nineteen proteins, out of a total of 364 proteins identified in both groups, differed significantly in concentration between the breast milk of allergic and non-allergic mothers. Protease inhibitors and apolipoproteins were present in much higher concentrations in breast milk of allergic than non-allergic mothers. These proteins have been suggested to be linked to allergy and asthma.The non-targeted milk proteomic analysis employed has provided new targets for future studies on the relation between breast milk composition and allergy."
https://openalex.org/W2091443188,"In vertebrates, hyaluronan is produced in the plasma membrane from cytosolic UDP-sugar substrates by hyaluronan synthase 1–3 (HAS1–3) isoenzymes that transfer N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) and glucuronic acid (GlcUA) in alternative positions in the growing polysaccharide chain during its simultaneous extrusion into the extracellular space. It has been shown that HAS2 immunoprecipitates contain functional HAS2 homomers and also heteromers with HAS3 (Karousou, E., Kamiryo, M., Skandalis, S.

Significance: Different HAS complexes may have specific effects on hyaluronan synthesis. Hyaluronan is a ubiquitous glycosaminoglycan present in the pericellular and extracellular matrix of most vertebrate tissues. It is a hydrophilic polysaccharide, which tends to form gels even at low concentrations (1.Laurent T.C. Laurent U.B. Fraser J.R. The structure and function of hyaluronan: an overview.Immunol. Cell Biol. 1996; 74: A1-A7Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). It serves as a space filler, providing elasticity for soft connective tissues, lubrication for synovial joints, transparency for the vitreous body, and extracellular diffusion routes for cellular nutrients and waste products (2.Tammi M.I. Day A.J. Turley E.A. Hyaluronan and homeostasis: a balancing act.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4581-4584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). Hyaluronan can also be considered as a kind of cushion, buffering cells from physical and chemical impacts, as reflected by its rapidly increasing synthesis in inflammation and tissue injury. Hyaluronan is very abundant during embryonic development, where it is associated with cell migration and proliferation during organogenesis (3.Bakkers J. Kramer C. Pothof J. Quaedvlieg N.E.

Has2 is required upstream of Rac1 to govern dorsal migration of lateral cells during zebrafish gastrulation.Development. 2004; 131: 525-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). A genetic defect in hyaluronan synthesis leads to a lethal failure in heart development (4.Camenisch T.D. Schroeder J.A. Bradley J. Klewer S.E. McDonald J.A. Heart-valve mesenchyme formation is dependent on hyaluronan-augmented activation of ErbB2-ErbB3 receptors.Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 850-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Recent research has also assigned a number of critical signaling functions to hyaluronan, mediated by its cell surface receptors (CD44 and RHAMM) (5.Tolg C. Hamilton S.R. Zalinska E. McCulloch L.

These enzymes have two different glycosyltransferase activities in a single polypeptide. Using cytosolic UDP-glucuronic acid and UDP-N-acetylglucosamine as donor substrates (15.Weigel P.H.

This results in alternating positions of these monosaccharides and the formation of a repeated disaccharide structure (-GlcNAc-GlcUA-) in a linear glycosaminoglycan chain, usually of a molecular mass in the range of 106 to 107 Da (16.Tammi R.H. Passi A.G. Rilla K. Karousou E. Vigetti D. Makkonen K. Tammi M.I. Transcriptional and post-translational regulation of hyaluronan synthesis.FEBS J. 2011; 278: 1419-1428Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Unlike other vertebrate glycoconjugates, hyaluronan is not known to be built on any protein or lipid core. For Streptococcus equisimilis hyaluronan synthase (seHAS) the possibility of lipid or protein carriers that could initiate hyaluronan synthesis, has been excluded (17.Hubbard C. McNamara J.T. Azumaya C. Patel M.S. Zimmer J. The hyaluronan synthase catalyzes the synthesis and membrane translocation of hyaluronan.J. Mol. Biol. 2012; 418: 21-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Moreover, while HAS polypeptides are co-translationally inserted in the ER membrane and transported to the Golgi apparatus, they become activated only after reaching the plasma membrane (18.Prehm P. Hyaluronate is synthesized at plasma membranes.Biochem. J. 1984; 220: 597-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). The mechanisms that turn on hyaluronan synthesis at the plasma membrane, but prevent the premature activation in intracellular membranes, remain obscure. However, substrate supply and HAS localization are dynamically coupled as depletion of UDP-GlcUA (19.Rilla K. Siiskonen H. Spicer A.P. Hyttinen J.M. Tammi M.I. Tammi R.H.

Translocation of HAS between the plasma membrane and intracellular membranes involves vesicular trafficking factors like Rab10 (21.Deen A.J. Rilla K. Oikari S. Kärnä R. Bart G. Häyrinen J.

Active hyaluronan synthesis at plasma membrane also requires a pore for simultaneous extrusion of the growing polysaccharide chain into the extracellular space. Streptococcal HAS itself forms the pore together with phospholipids, (17.Hubbard C. McNamara J.T. Azumaya C. Patel M.S. Zimmer J. The hyaluronan synthase catalyzes the synthesis and membrane translocation of hyaluronan.J. Mol. Biol. 2012; 418: 21-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 22.Medina A.P. Lin J. Weigel P.H. Hyaluronan synthase mediates dye translocation across liposomal membranes.BMC Biochem. 2012; 13: 2Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), although this has not been firmly demonstrated for vertebrate HASs. Modulation of multidrug-resistant transporter activity affects hyaluronan synthesis in mammalian cells, and multidrug resistant proteins have been suggested to mediate hyaluronan transport (23.Hagenfeld D. Borkenhagen B. Schulz T. Schillers H. Schumacher U. Prehm P. Hyaluronan export through plasma membranes depends on concurrent K+ efflux by K(ir) channels.PLoS One. 2012; 7: e39096Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). However, the evidence of hyaluronan extrusion through separate transporters has remained circumstantial, and their role has been disputed (24.Thomas N.K. Brown T.J. ABC transporters do not contribute to extracellular translocation of hyaluronan in human breast cancer in vitro.Exp. Cell Res. 2010; 316: 1241-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The fact that hyaluronan is not generally detected in the cytosolic side of the plasma membrane (25.Siiskonen H. Rilla K. Kärnä R. Bart G. Jing W. Haller M.F. DeAngelis P.L. Tammi R.H. Tammi M.I. Hyaluronan in cytosol-microinjection-based probing of its existence and suggested functions.Glycobiology. 2013; 23: 222-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), where it should be found if entering a separate extrusion channel, speaks against the existence of a separate pore for hyaluronan export. This is also consistent with the findings that streptococcal (26.Tlapak-Simmons V.L. Kempner E.S. Baggenstoss B.A. Weigel P.H. The active streptococcal hyaluronan synthases (HASs) contain a single HAS monomer and multiple cardiolipin molecules.J. Biol.

Bacterial exopolysaccharide synthesis also involves membrane-associated glycosyltransferases that presumably form a translocation pore for the transfer of their product into the periplasm. For example, the extrusion pore of the poly-β-1,6-N-acetylglucosamine synthesis machinery of Yersinia pestis (28.Bobrov A.G. Kirillina O. Forman S. Mack D. Perry R.D.

Allosteric activation of exopolysaccharide synthesis through cyclic di-GMP-stimulated protein-protein interaction.EMBO J. 2013; 32: 354-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) is suggested to require the formation of a heterodimer with altogether 6 transmembrane domains. On the other hand, channels such as lactose permease contain 12 transmembrane α-helices (30.Smirnova I. Kasho V. Kaback H.R. Lactose permease and the alternating access mechanism.Biochemistry. 2011; 50: 9684-9693Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), whereas the two protein subunits of bacterial cellulose synthase contain altogether 9 transmembrane domains and couple polymerization with membrane penetration (31.Morgan J.L. Strumillo J. Zimmer J. Crystallographic snapshot of cellulose synthesis and membrane translocation.Nature. 2013; 493: 181-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). The closest relatives of the HASs, the insect chitin synthases, contain up to 16 membrane-spanning α-helices and are likely functional as dimers or oligomers (32.Merzendorfer H. Insect chitin synthases: a review.J. Comp. Physiol. B. 2006; 176: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). For HAS enzymes, the previously proposed schematic structures (15.Weigel P.H. DeAngelis P.L. Hyaluronan synthases: a decade-plus of novel glycosyltransferases.J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 36777-36781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar) have not considered the possibility of homo- or heteromeric HAS complexes. Indeed, this possibility was raised for the first time in a recent study in which co-immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that HAS2 forms homomeric complexes and even heteromeric complexes with HAS3 (33.Karousou E. Kamiryo M. Skandalis S.S. Ruusala A. Asteriou T. Passi A. Yamashita H. Hellman U. Heldin C.H. Heldin P. The activity of hyaluronan synthase 2 is regulated by dimerization and ubiquitination.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 23647-23654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The functional importance of the homomeric interactions of HAS2 was demonstrated when an enzymatically inactive HAS2 mutant showed a dominant negative effect on hyaluronan synthesis when co-transfected with an enzymatically active HAS2 (33.Karousou E. Kamiryo M. Skandalis S.S. Ruusala A. Asteriou T. Passi A. Yamashita H. Hellman U. Heldin C.H. Heldin P. The activity of hyaluronan synthase 2 is regulated by dimerization and ubiquitination.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 23647-23654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). In the present work, we have explored potential homo- and heteromeric interactions among mammalian HAS isoforms in cells in situ using fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) and proximity ligation assays (PLA). The results establish that all three human HAS isoforms can interact with each other. The data also suggest that the different HAS isoenzyme combinations expressed in various cells and cellular environments may have specific effects on hyaluronan biosynthesis. The plasmids for flow cytometric FRET analyses were made as follows. The functional open reading frames (ORF) of human hyaluronan synthase genes, Has1 (NCBI nucleotide accession number NM_001523), Has2 (NM_005328), and Has3 (NM_005329) were amplified from human cDNA and first ligated in-frame with the pDendra2-C vector (Evrogen, Moscow). The HAS cDNAs in Dendra2 plasmids were subcloned by 25 cycles of PCR with pfu polymerase (Fermentas) into either the pcDNA3-Myc tag vector (HAS1 and HAS3) or the pcDNA3-HA tag vector (HAS2) using the HindIII and XhoI restriction sites and the following primers: 5′-HAS1, ATTAAAGCTTATGAGACAGCAGGACGCGC, and 3′-HAS1, ATTACTCGAGCACCTGGACGCGGTAGC; 5′-HAS2, ATTAAAGCTTATGCATTGTGAGAGGTTTCTATGTATC, and 3′-HAS2, ATTACTCGAGTACATCAAGCACCATGTCATATTGT; and 5′-HAS3, ATTAAAGCTTATGCCGGTGCAGCTG, and 3′-HAS3, ATTACTCGAGCACCTCAGCAAAAGCCAAG. All of the constructs were sequenced to verify that no mutations had arisen. Primers for pcDNA3 forward and reverse (Fwd, ACGACTCACTATAGGGAGAC; Rev, AATGCTAGAGCTCGCTGATC) were used for the sequencing together with new ones (designed to sequence from about 500 bp inside each gene (HAS1, GGGAGGTGGAGGCG; HAS2, TGCAAAAATGGGGTGG; and HAS3, CGTGCATCATGCAGAAGT) to allow complete sequencing of the constructs. Each HAS cDNA was PCR-amplified, and the product was inserted into the pcDNA3 vector (Clontech) using HindIII and XhoI restriction sites and the sequences verified. The vector also contained sequences encoding a C-terminal 5-amino acid linker region (RSIAT) followed by either the monomeric Cerulean (mCer), monomeric Venus (mVen), HA (YPYDVPDYA), or Myc (EQKLISEEDL) tag (34.Hassinen A. Pujol F.M. Kokkonen N. Pieters C. Kihlström M. Korhonen K. Kellokumpu S.

Chem. 2011; 286: 38329-38340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Thus, the constructs for flow cytometric FRET had the tags in the C terminus of the HASs. EGFP-HAS1 was created by inserting the XhoI-EcoRI fragment from the Dendra2-HAS1 plasmid into the pEGFP-C1 vector. mCherry-HAS1 was created by ligating together mCherry with NheI-BglII, HAS1 BglII-EcoRI, and pCI-Neo NheI-EcoRI. mCherry-Has2 was created by ligating together mCherry NheI-BglII, HAS2 BglII-SalI, and pCI-Neo NheI-SalI. The construction of EGFP-HAS2, EGFP-HAS3, and mRFP-HAS3 have been described elsewhere (21.Deen A.J. Rilla K. Oikari S. Kärnä R. Bart G. Häyrinen J. Bathina A.R. Ropponen A. Makkonen K. Tammi R.H.

Chem. 2014; 289: 8375-8389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). mCherry-HAS3 was created by ligating together mCherry NheI-XhoI, HAS3 XhoI-EcoRI, and pCI-Neo with XhoI-EcoRI. C-terminally truncated EGFP-HAS1 (143 residues) was created by the digestion of EGFP-HAS1 with SalI followed by religation. C-terminally truncated mCherry-HAS3 (220 residues) and EGFP-HAS3 (166 residues) were made by digestion with BamHI and PstI, respectively, before religation. C-terminally truncated EGFP-HAS3–86 was produced by digesting EGFP-HAS3 (86 residues) with SacII and religation. N-terminally truncated HAS3 was produced by ligating together the HAS3 C-terminal fragments SacII-EcoRI, EGFP-C3 NheI-SacII, and PCIneo NheI-EcoRI. C-terminally mCherry-tagged HAS3 was created by replacing Cerulean with mCherry in pcDNA3-HAS3-Cer in XhoI-NotI restriction sites. COS1 cells were co-transfected with EGFP-HAS1, -2, or -3 and mCherry-HAS1 or -2 or mRFP-HAS3 in a 1:1 ratio. The efficiency of transfection and the presence of both fluorophores in cells were verified by microscopy. 24–30 h after transfection the cells were scraped from the plates, and membrane proteins were prepared as described elsewhere (33.Karousou E.

Co-precipitation was tested in Western blots with anti-GFP antibody (Invitrogen) and imaged with an Odyssey infrared system (LI-COR, Lincoln, NE). COS7, COS1, HeLa, and MCF7 cells were cultivated in DMEM as described elsewhere (34.Hassinen A. Pujol F.M. Kokkonen N. Pieters C. Kihlström M. Korhonen K. Kellokumpu S.

One day after plating, the cells were transfected using 0.5 μg of each plasmid cDNA and the FuGENE 6TM transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science). After cultivation for 24 h at 37 or 30 °C, the cells were used for fluorescence microscopy, flow cytometric FRET, or enzyme activity measurements (hyaluronan synthesis). Cells were processed for indirect immunofluorescence as described previously (36.Kokkonen N. Rivinoja A. Kauppila A. Suokas M. Kellokumpu I. Kellokumpu S.

After fixation, the cells were permeabilized with 1 ml of 0.1% saponin in 1% BSA-PBS, pH 7.4, and stained with the Golgi marker antibody (anti-GM130 610822, BD Biosciences) and Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated secondary antibodies (Invitrogen). After staining, the cells were imaged using a Zeiss Observer Z1 equipped with a LSM 700 confocal unit, 63 × PlanApo oil immersion objective, the appropriate filter sets for CFP, YFP, and Alexa Fluor 594, and ZEN 2009 software (Carl Zeiss AG, Oberkochen, Germany). FRET measurements were done as described (35.Hassinen A. Rivinoja A. Kauppila A. Kellokumpu S. Golgi N-glycosyltransferases form both homo- and heterodimeric enzyme complexes in live cells.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 17771-17777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 day after plating, the cells were transfected with the FRET plasmid constructs that encoded selected enzymes tagged with either mCer or mVen. After 24 h, the cells were detached from the plates with 2× trypsin-EDTA (Sigma-Aldrich), diluted, and analyzed on a flow cytometer (CyFlow, Partec GmbH, Münster, Germany) equipped with the appropriate filter sets for mCer (405 ex and 425–475 em) and mVen (488 ex, 515–540 em). In each measurement, 2–5 × 103 cells expressing both mCer and mVen were selected by gating (for setting and validation of the gates, see Ref. 34.Hassinen A. Pujol F.M. Kokkonen N. Pieters C.

The FRET filter set (405 ex and 515–540 em) and FloMax software were used for quantification. The FRET signal is presented as the percentage of FRET positive (FRET+) cells of those that express both the mCer and mVen constructs (mean ± S.D.). A value higher than 5% was considered relevant. COS1 cells were routinely cultivated in DMEM, high glucose (Invitrogen), 10% FBS (HyClone), 2 mm glutamine, and 50 units/ml penicillin (EuroClone). For experiments, cells were plated on 8-well Ibidi® chamber slides for 24 h before transfection at 15,000 cells/well. The medium level was adjusted to 200 μl just prior to transfection. Per well, 12.5 μl of 150 mm NaCl, 0.1 μg of DNA (EGFP/mCherry plasmid ratio, 1/1), and 0.5 μl of Exgen 500 Fermentas, Helsinki, Finland) were mixed. The cells were fixed 48 h after transfection in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min and then washed for 5 min in 50 mm Tris and 100 mm NaCl, pH 8.0, and kept in PBS at 4 °C before analysis. A Zeiss LSM700 confocal microscope with a Plan-Apochromat 40×/1.3 oil DIC M27 objective was used. Cells expressing both EGFP- and mCherry-tagged HAS constructs were examined. Images from EGFP (ex 488 nm and em 555 nm with a short pass filter) and mCherry (ex 555 nm) were taken separately. To measure FRET efficiency, mCherry was photobleached using a 555-nm laser at the maximum setting for 10–30 s, and then second pictures of both fluorophores were taken. Images were analyzed using an image-processing software package (Fiji) with ImageJ and several other plugins organized into a coherent menu structure. FRET efficiency (E) was calculated for each pixel in the bleached area as follows: E = (Idonor post-bleach − Idonor pre-bleach)/Idonor post-bleach × 100, where Idonor is the intensity of EGFP fluorescence. The microscopic FRET setup was essentially as described previously (37.Bastiaens P.I. Majoul I.V. Verveer P.J. Söling H.D. Jovin T.M.

This and the observation that SETMAR is not active on nucleosomes suggest that H3K36 methylation is not a physiologically relevant activity. To identify potential non-histone substrates, we utilized a strategy on the basis of quantitative proteomic analysis of methylated lysine.

However, it is critical to ascertain whether edited iPSCs harbor unfavorable genomic variations before their clinical application. To examine the mutation status of the edited iPSC genome and trace the origin of possible mutations at different steps, we have generated virus-free iPSCs from amniotic cells carrying homozygous point mutations in β-hemoglobin gene (HBB) that cause severe β-thalassemia (β-Thal), corrected the mutations in both HBB alleles by zinc finger nuclease-aided gene targeting, and obtained the final HBB gene-corrected iPSCs by excising the exogenous drug resistance gene with Cre recombinase. Through comparative genomic hybridization and whole-exome sequencing, we uncovered seven copy number variations, five small insertions/deletions, and 64 single nucleotide variations (SNVs) in β-Thal iPSCs before the gene targeting step and found a single small copy number variation, 19 insertions/deletions, and 340 single nucleotide variations in the final gene-corrected β-Thal iPSCs.

For example, it was reported that iPSCs carried more frequent CNVs than other cell lines, such as ES cells and somatic cells (9.Ma H. Morey R. O'Neil R.C. He Y. Daughtry B. Schultz M.D. Hariharan M.

Some of these CNVs were certainly attributed to the reprogramming process (11.Abyzov A. Mariani J. Palejev D. Zhang Y. Haney M.S. Tomasini L. Ferrandino A.F. Rosenberg Belmaker L.A. Szekely A.

However, in another report, very few nucleotide level variations, such as non-synonymous single nucleotide variations (SNVs) and insertions/deletions (Indels), were found in iPSCs generated through a non-viral approach (15.Cheng L.

Similarly, the impact on genome stability of genome-editing tools, such as transcriptional activator-like effector nucleases or clustered regulatory interspaced short palindromic repeat/Cas9, has also been analyzed (16.Tsai S.Q. Joung J.K. What's changed with genome editing?.Cell Stem Cell. 2014; 15: 3-4Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In general, these genome-editing tools seemed not to induce much genome variation based on the whole-genome sequencing data (17.Veres A. Gosis B.S. Ding Q. Collins R. Ragavendran A. Brand H. Erdin S.

The current study was designed to examine the genome variations generated throughout the process of producing gene-corrected β-Thal iPSCs, including iPSC generation through a non-viral approach, clonal selection, expansion, genome editing, and exogenous gene excision. We first generated an integration-free β-Thal iPSC line from amniocytes that carried homozygous point mutations in the second intron of HBB (site 654). We then corrected both mutated HBB alleles by ZFN-aided gene targeting and excised exogenous drug resistance genes to obtain the final HBB-corrected iPSCs. Next, we performed sequential CGHs and exome sequencing on parental cells used for iPSC derivation, iPSCs before gene correction, and the final gene-corrected β-Thal iPSCs. Our results showed that iPSC derivation even with a non-viral approach could generate a certain number of variations, including both CNVs and SNVs. Meanwhile, the subsequent ZFN-aided gene targeting caused negligible CNVs but a lot more SNVs. Our analysis indicated that factor-induced somatic cell reprogramming and ZFN-aided gene targeting tend to generate different genomic variations. These variations need to be carefully analyzed and evaluated before the clinical application of personalized gene-corrected iPSCs for cellular therapy. The methods of isolating amniotic fluid cells and iPSC generation from a β-thalassemia patient were performed as described previously (2.Ma N. Liao B. Zhang H. Wang L. Shan Y. Xue Y. Huang K. Chen S. Zhou X. Chen Y. Pei D. Pan G. Transcription activator-like effector nuclease (TALEN)-mediated gene correction in integration-free beta-thalassemia induced pluripotent stem cells.J. Biol.

The amniotic fluid cells were cultured in Amniogrow PLUS (Cytogen), and the iPS cells were maintained in mTeSR1 (Stemcell Technologies). All cell types were maintained at 5% CO2. ZFNs were designed by Sigma-Aldrich. The ZFN pair was designed to target the 3′-side region that was ∼600 bp downstream of the last exon of HBB gene (see Fig. 1D, underlined). The HBB-ZFN pair recognition sequences were 5′-CACTCTTTCACAGTCTGC and 5′-CTAAGCCCAGTCCTT. They were expressed from two plasmids under the control of the CMV promoter. The left and right homology arms were amplified from genomic DNA of a healthy individual. The primer sets HBBL-F/R amplified the 2.3-kb left arm, and HBBR-F/R amplified the 1.5-kb right arm. A loxP-flanked PGK-neomycin cassette or loxP-flanked PGK-puromycin cassette were inserted between two homology arms into the pMD-18T vector (Takara). For targeting, 1 × 106 iPSCs were electroporated with 2 μg of donor DNA and 4.5 μg of each ZFN plasmid. Then the electroporated iPS cells were plated onto Matrigel-coated 6-well plates in the presence of Y-27632 (10 nm; Sigma) for 1 day. Positive clones were selected by puromycin (0.5 μg/ml) or G418 (100 μg/ml; Sigma) in mTeSR1.

The primer set including P1 and P2 was used to amplify a 2.8-kb product of the 5′-junction of a targeted integration (see Fig. 1D). The primer set including P3 and P4 was used to amplify a 2-kb product or a 500-bp product to identify whether random integration occurred. The primer pair IVS-654-F/R was used to amplify a 600-bp product containing the mutant region of HBB, and then PCR products were sequenced to identify the corrected clones. All primers sequences are listed in Table 1. A 502-bp HBB-specific probe in the 5′-side of the left homology arm was synthesized by PCR amplification using the primer pair 5′probe-F/R and DIG-dUTP labeling kit (Roche Applied Science). Genomic DNA was digested by BglII, and then standard Southern blotting was performed following the instructions of DIG High Prime DNA Labeling and Detection Starter kit II (Roche Applied Science). Cells were digested by 0.25% trypsin (Invitrogen) and fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at 37 °C. After washing with 2% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Excell) in PBS, cells were permeabilized with 90% methanol for 30 min on ice. After washing, cells were incubated with primary antibodies for 30 min at 37 °C. Meanwhile, control samples were incubated with isotype control antibodies for 30 min at 37 °C. After washing, cells were incubated with secondary antibodies for 30 min at 37 °C. The cells were washed and resuspended in PBS and then analyzed on an Accuri C6 (BD Biosciences) (21.Xue Y. Cai X.

Generating a non-integrating human induced pluripotent stem cell bank from urine-derived cells.PLoS One. 2013; 8: e70573Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The antibodies used were OCT3/4 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-5279), SSEA4 antibody (Abcam, AB16287), and HBB antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-21757). Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol (Invitrogen) and reverse transcribed using oligo(dT) (Takara), and then quantitative PCR was performed with a CFX96 machine (Bio-Rad) and a SYBR Green Premix EX TaqTM kit (Takara) following the manufacturers' instruction manuals. β-Actin was used for quantitative RT-PCR normalization, and all data were measured in triplicate. Primer sequences are listed in Table 1. βThal654_iPSCre16 cells cultured on a Matrigel-coated 10-cm plate were digested by Dispase (Invitrogen), resuspended in Matrigel (BD Biosciences), and then injected subcutaneously into immunodeficient mice. Teratomas were dissected after 8 weeks, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, and then processed for hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining. βThal654_iPS and βThal654_iPSCre16 cells were harvested by Dispase (Invitrogen) digestion and co-cultured with OP9 stromal cells for 8 days at 2.5 × 106 cells/10-cm dish in 20 ml of α-minimum Eagle's medium (Gibco) supplemented with 10% FBS (HyClone), 100 μm monothioglycerol (Sigma), and 100 μm vitamin C. Half of the culture medium was changed at days 4 and 6. CD34+ cells were directly sorted out using a CD34 Progenitor Cell Isolation kit (Miltenyi Biotec) at day 8. Hematopoietic colony-forming unit (cfu) assays were performed using 2 ml/dish MethoCult GF+ H4435 semisolid medium (Stemcell Technologies) following the manufacturer's instruction manuals on 35-mm low adherence plastic dishes (Monroe). The number of CD34+ cells sorted by magnetic activated cell sorting for cfu assays was about 5 × 105 cells. Colonies were counted after 12–14 days. Genomic DNAs extracted from donor cells (amniotic fluid cells), βThal654_iPS cells, and βThal654_iPSCre16 cells were digested using AluI and RsaI enzymes. A SureTag DNA labeling kit (Agilent) was applied for DNA labeling. First, different fluorescence dyes were used for DNA labeling of βThal654_iPS cells (Cy5-dUTP) and the donor amniotic fluid cells (Cy3-dUTP). Labeled βThal654_iPS cell DNA was hybridized with the labeled donor cell DNA following the instruction manuals of the SurePrint G3 human CGH microarray kit (1 × 1 M, Agilent). Second, different fluorescence dyes were used for DNA labeling of βThal654_iPSCre16 cells (Cy5-dUTP) and βThal654_iPS cells (Cy3-dUTP). Labeled βThal654_iPSCre16 cell DNA was hybridized with the labeled βThal654_iPS cell DNA following the instruction manuals of the SurePrint G3 human CGH microarray kit (1 × 1 M, Agilent). We followed oligonucleotide array-based CGH protocol version 6.0 (Agilent) to process DNA samples and handle and scan microarray profiles. Then the microarray scanning profiles were processed and analyzed by Feature Extraction 10.7.3.1 (Agilent) and Workbench 7.0 (Agilent). The threshold of the Aberration Detection Method-2 algorithm was set to 6.0 with Fuzzy Zero. CNVs were named by at least four consecutive probes with log2 ratio (samples were labeled with a ratio of fluorescent Cy5 and Cy3) consistent with duplication or deletion (duplication and deletion are larger than 1 kb). Genomic DNAs were extracted from donor amniotic fluid cells, βThal654_iPS cells, and βThal654_iPSCre16 cells. We used SeqCap EZ Exome 64M (Roche NimbleGen) and a TruSeq DNA sample preparation kit (Illumina) to capture the exome and establish the exome sequencing library following the manufacturers' instruction manuals. All sequencing was carried out on an Illumina HiSeq 2000 sequencer with a paired end 2 × 100-nucleotide multiplex. Human genome build GRCh37 (hg19) was selected as the reference human genome in these analyses. The 2 × 100-nucleotide paired-end reads were mapped onto the human reference genome using Burrows-Wheeler Alignment version 0.5.9. Potential PCR repetitions were removed using Samtools (version 0.1.18), and mapping profiles were analyzed using flagstat. Targeted genomic regions had at least 30× coverage. Candidate βThal654_iPS mutations were defined as variants that were present in a given βThal654_iPS exome but not in the donor amniotic cells, and candidate βThal654_iPSCre16 mutations were defined as variants that were present in a given βThal654_iPSCre16 exome but not in βThal654_iPS. To exclude the false positives caused by insufficient depths of exome sequencing, we first filtered out the Indels and SNVs with coverage of sequencing depth less than 10×. For Indel analysis, we also filtered out the direct repeats, homopolymers, and repetitive sequences that were caused by the technical limitation of high throughput, short read sequencing technologies (16.Tsai S.Q. Joung J.K. What's changed with genome editing?.Cell Stem Cell. 2014; 15: 3-4Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Selected SNVs and Indels were validated by Sanger sequencing. All primers sequences are listed in Table 1. We have previously derived an iPSC line from the amniotic cells of a fetus that was diagnosed with β-Thal major (IVS2-654), which was named βThal654_iPS. The cell line carries two homozygous C→T mutations at the second intron of HBB gene (2.Ma N. Liao B. Zhang H. Wang L. Shan Y. Xue Y. Huang K. Chen S. Zhou X. Chen Y. Pei D. Pan G.

Chem. 2013; 288: 34671-34679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). A reporter assay showed that our ZFNs designed for HBB targeting exhibited satisfactory activity and specificity (2.Ma N. Liao B. Zhang H. Wang L. Shan Y. Xue Y. Huang K. Chen S. Zhou X. Chen Y. Pei D. Pan G. Transcription activator-like effector nuclease (TALEN)-mediated gene correction in integration-free beta-thalassemia induced pluripotent stem cells.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 34671-34679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1, A, B, and C). We failed to obtain an iPSC line with both HBB alleles corrected through one round of gene targeting. Thus, we used a two-step strategy to correct mutated HBB alleles sequentially with HBB-specific ZFNs (Fig. 1D). Then we constructed two targeting vectors containing different drug resistance genes, one for neomycin and the other for puromycin, to achieve homologous recombination for gene targeting (Fig. 1D). We first introduced the neomycin-resistant donor template together with ZFNs into the βThal654_iPSCs. After selected by G418, we obtained the iPSCs with a single HBB allele targeted, which were named βThal654_iPSG2 (Fig. 1E). The correction was further confirmed by genomic PCR, Southern blotting, and Sanger sequencing (Fig. 1, F, G, and H). Similarly, we introduced the second donor template with the puromycin resistance gene and ZFNs into βThal654_iPSG2 and obtained an iPSC line with both HBB alleles targeted, which was named βThal654_iPSG2Pu11 (Fig. 1E). Both drug resistance genes were then excised by Cre recombinase to generate the final gene-corrected iPSCs, which were named βThal654_iPSCre16 (Fig. 1E). The iPS clone was validated by genomic PCR and Southern blotting (Fig. 1, F and G). Lastly, by Sanger sequencing, we confirmed that the C→T mutations of both alleles were both corrected in βThal654_iPSCre16 (Fig. 1H). G binding analysis showed that both uncorrected (2.Ma N. Liao B.

The gene-corrected βThal654_iPSCre16 exhibited typical human embryonic stem cell morphology (Fig. 1E) and expressed pluripotent markers, such as OCT4, SOX2, NANOG, and SSEA4, as detected by FACS and quantitative RT-PCR (Fig. 2, A and B). Upon injection into immunodeficient mice, the corrected βThal654_iPSCre16 cells could form teratomas containing all three germ layers (Fig. 2C). These data demonstrate that the pluripotency of iPSCs was maintained after ZFN-mediated gene targeting. To further examine whether the correction of disease-causing mutations could restore the normal expression of HBB, we performed hematopoietic differentiation of uncorrected and corrected β-Thal iPS cells based on an OP9 co-culture protocol described previously (2.Ma N. Liao B. Zhang H. Wang L. Shan Y. Xue Y. Huang K. Chen S. Zhou X. Chen Y. Pei D. Pan G.

Here, we present evidence for the influence of phospholipid bilayers on complex formation between rabbit P450 2B4 (CYP2B4) and rabbit cytb5 at the atomic level, utilizing NMR techniques. General line broadening and modest chemical shift perturbations of cytb5 resonances characterize CYP2B4-cytb5 interactions on the intermediate time scale. More significant intensity attenuation and a more specific protein-protein binding interface are observed in bicelles as compared with lipid-free solution, highlighting the importance of the lipid bilayer in stabilizing stronger and more specific interactions between CYP2B4 and cytb5, which may lead to a more efficient electron transfer. Similar results observed for the interactions between CYP2B4 lacking the transmembrane domain (tr-CYP2B4) and cytb5 imply interactions between tr-CYP2B4 and the membrane surface, which might assist in CYP2B4-cytb5 complex formation by orienting tr-CYP2B4 for efficient contact with cytb5.

Polymorphisms in this gene have been associated with variation in skin and hair color and with elevated risk for the development of melanoma. Here we used 11 computational tools based on different approaches to predict the damage-associated non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (nsSNPs) in the coding region of the human MC1R gene. Among the 92 nsSNPs arranged according to the predictions 62% were classified as damaging in more than five tools. The classification was significantly correlated with the scores of two consensus programs. Alleles associated with the red hair color (RHC) phenotype and with the risk of melanoma were examined. The R variants D84E, R142H, R151C, I155T, R160W and D294H were classified as damaging by the majority of the tools while the r variants V60L, V92M and R163Q have been predicted as neutral in most of the programs The combination of the prediction tools results in 14 nsSNPs indicated as the most damaging mutations in MC1R (L48P, R67W, H70Y, P72L, S83P, R151H, S172I, L206P, T242I, G255R, P256S, C273Y, C289R and R306H); C273Y showed to be highly damaging in SIFT, Polyphen-2, MutPred, PANTHER and PROVEAN scores.

https://openalex.org/W2045957039,"The identification of suitable reference genes is critical for obtaining reliable results from gene expression studies using quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) because the expression of reference genes may vary considerably under different experimental conditions. In most cases, however, commonly used reference genes are employed in data normalization without proper validation, which may lead to incorrect data interpretation. Here, we aim to select a set of optimal reference genes for the accurate normalization of gene expression associated with intramuscular fat (IMF) deposition during development. In the present study, eight reference genes (PPIB, HMBS, RPLP0, B2M, YWHAZ, 18S, GAPDH and ACTB) were evaluated by three different algorithms (geNorm, NormFinder and BestKeeper) in two types of muscle tissues (longissimus dorsi muscle and biceps femoris muscle) across different developmental stages. All three algorithms gave similar results. PPIB and HMBS were identified as the most stable reference genes, while the commonly used reference genes 18S and GAPDH were the most variably expressed, with expression varying dramatically across different developmental stages. Furthermore, to reveal the crucial role of appropriate reference genes in obtaining a reliable result, analysis of PPARG expression was performed by normalization to the most and the least stable reference genes. The relative expression levels of PPARG normalized to the most stable reference genes greatly differed from those normalized to the least stable one. Therefore, evaluation of reference genes must be performed for a given experimental condition before the reference genes are used. PPIB and HMBS are the optimal reference genes for analysis of gene expression associated with IMF deposition in skeletal muscle during development."

The molecular mechanism of ChR2 has been extensively studied by a variety of spectroscopic methods, including light-induced difference Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, which is sensitive to structural changes in the protein upon light activation. An atomic structure of channelrhodopsin was recently determined by x-ray crystallography using a chimera of channelrhodopsin-1 (ChR1) and ChR2. Electrophysiological studies have shown that ChR1/ChR2 chimeras are less desensitized upon continuous illumination than native ChR2, implying that there are some structural differences between ChR2 and chimeras. In this study, we applied light-induced difference FTIR spectroscopy to ChR2 and ChR1/ChR2 chimeras to determine the molecular basis underlying these functional differences. Upon continuous illumination, ChR1/ChR2 chimeras exhibited structural changes distinct from those in ChR2. In particular, the protonation state of a glutamate residue, Glu-129 (Glu-90 in ChR2 numbering), in the ChR chimeras is not changed as dramatically as in ChR2. Moreover, using mutants stabilizing particular photointermediates as well as time-resolved measurements, we identified some differences between the major photointermediates of ChR2 and ChR1/ChR2 chimeras. Taken together, our data indicate that the gating and desensitizing processes in ChR1/ChR2 chimeras are different from those in ChR2 and that these differences should be considered in the rational design of new optogenetic tools based on channelrhodopsins.Background: Channelrhodopsins, light-gated cation channels, are widely used for optogenetics.Results: Channelrhodopsin-1/2 chimeras exhibit light-induced conformational changes with reduced Glu-129 deprotonation (Glu-90 in channelrhodopsin-2).Conclusion: First and second channelrhodopsin-1 transmembrane helices are prerequisite for converting photostationary state of channelrhodopsin-2 into reduced desensitized state.Significance: Channelrhodopsin-2 has some structural differences from a channelrhodopsin chimera whose x-ray crystal structure has been solved.

We have shown that His-389 → Gln disrupts the binding of NCF2 to the ZF domain of VAV1, resulting in decreased NADPH oxidase activity. With respect to Arg-395 → Trp, using protein docking and structure analyses, we provide a model for the involvement of this mutation in the structure and function of the NADPH oxidase complex. This model assigns a central role to Arg-395 in the structure and stability of the quaternary NCF2/NCF4/VAV1/RAC1 NADPH oxidase complex. Arg-395 stabilizes the C-terminal tail of NCF4 and the conformation of NCF2 loop 395–402, which in turn stabilize the evolutionarily conserved interactions of NCF2/NCF4 with the DH domain of VAV1 and RAC1 region 120–137. Our findings are consistent with the high levels of conservation of all of the residues involved in these interactions."

https://openalex.org/W1976916493,"Muscle loading is important for maintaining muscle mass; when load is removed, atrophy is inevitable. However, in clinical situations such as critical care myopathy, masticatory muscles do not lose mass. Thus, their properties may be harnessed to preserve mass. We compared masticatory and appendicular muscles responses to microgravity, using mice aboard the space shuttle Space Transportation System-135. Age- and sex-matched controls remained on the ground. After 13 days of space flight, 1 masseter (MA) and tibialis anterior (TA) were frozen rapidly for biochemical and functional measurements, and the contralateral MA was processed for morphologic measurements. Flight TA muscles exhibited 20 ± 3% decreased muscle mass, 2-fold decreased phosphorylated (P)-Akt, and 4- to 12-fold increased atrogene expression. In contrast, MAs had no significant change in mass but a 3-fold increase in P-focal adhesion kinase, 1.5-fold increase in P-Akt, and 50-90% lower atrogene expression compared with limb muscles, which were unaltered in microgravity. Myofibril force measurements revealed that microgravity caused a 3-fold decrease in specific force and maximal shortening velocity in TA muscles. It is surprising that myofibril-specific force from both control and flight MAs were similar to flight TA muscles, yet power was compromised by 40% following flight. Continued loading in microgravity prevents atrophy, but masticatory muscles have a different set point that mimics disuse atrophy in the appendicular muscle.— Philippou, A., Minozzo, F.

https://openalex.org/W1977508709,"High species diversity and endemism within Madagascar is mainly the result of species radiations following colonization from nearby continents or islands. Most of the endemic taxa are thought to be descendants of a single or small number of colonizers that arrived from Africa sometime during the Cenozoic and gave rise to highly diverse groups. This pattern is largely based on vertebrates and a small number of invertebrate groups. Knowledge of the evolutionary history of aquatic beetles on Madagascar is lacking, even though this species-rich group is often a dominant part of invertebrate freshwater communities in both standing and running water. Here we focus on large bodied diving beetles of the tribes Hydaticini and Cybistrini. Our aims with this study were to answer the following questions 1) How many colonization events does the present Malagasy fauna originate from? 2) Did any colonization event lead to a species radiation? 3) Where did the colonizers come from—Africa or Asia—and has there been any out-of-Madagascar event? 4) When did these events occur and were they concentrated to any particular time interval? Our results suggest that neither in Hydaticini nor in Cybistrini was there a single case of two or more endemic species forming a monophyletic group. The biogeographical analysis indicated different colonization histories for the two tribes. Cybistrini required at least eight separate colonization events, including the non-endemic species, all comparatively recent except the only lotic (running water) living Cybister operosus with an inferred colonization at 29 Ma. In Hydaticini the Madagascan endemics were spread out across the tree, often occupying basal positions in different species groups. The biogeographical analyses therefore postulated the very bold hypothesis of a Madagascan origin at a very deep basal node within Hydaticus and multiple out-of-Madagascar dispersal events. This hypothesis needs to be tested with equally intense taxon sampling of mainland Africa as for Madagascar."

Current elastic net model utilized a sure independence screening to select relevant genomic features with drug response, but it may neglect the combination effect of some marginally weak features. In this work, we applied an iterative sure independence screening scheme to select drug response relevant features from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) dataset. For each drug in CCLE, we selected up to 40 features including gene expressions, mutation and copy number alterations of cancer-related genes, and some of them are significantly strong features but showing weak marginal correlation with drug response vector. Lasso regression based on the selected features showed that our prediction accuracies are higher than those by elastic net regression for most drugs."

Our goal was to determine how Tlr7 dose influences selection of the autoreactive B cell repertoire in NZW/BXSB. Yaa mice bearing the site-directed heavy chain transgene 3H9 that encodes for the TLR7 regulated anti-CL response. To create a physiologic setting in which autoreactive B cells compete for survival with non-autoreactive B cells, we generated bone marrow chimeras in which disease onset occurred with similar kinetics and the transferred 3H9+ female non-Yaa, male Yaa or male TLR7-/Yaa cells could be easily identified by positivity for GFP. Deletion of 3H9 B cells occurred in the bone marrow and the remaining 3H9 follicular B cells manifested a decrease in surface IgM. Although there were differences in the naïve repertoire between the chimeras it was not possible to distinguish a clear pattern of selection against lupus related autoreactivity in TLR7-/Yaa or female chimeras. By contrast, preferential expansion of 3H9+ B cells occurred in the germinal centers of male Yaa chimeras. In addition, although all chimeras preferentially selected 3H9/Vκ5 encoded B cells into the germinal center and plasma cell compartments, 3H9 male Yaa chimeras had a more diverse repertoire and positively selected the 3H9/Vκ5-48/Jκ4 pair that confers high affinity anti-cardiolipin activity. We were unable to demonstrate a consistent effect of Tlr7 dose or Yaa on somatic mutations. Our data show that TLR7 excess influences the selection, expansion and diversification of B cells in the germinal center, independent of other genes in the Yaa locus."

Objective This study aimed at assessing the impact of training with a virtual patient on confidence in providing clinical care for traumatized refugee patients. Methods The authors developed an educational tool based on virtual patient methodology portraying the case of “Mrs. K”, a traumatized refugee woman with symptoms of PTSD and depression. A group (N=32) of resident psychiatrists tested the system and their confidence in different aspects of providing clinical care for this patient group was evaluated pre- and post-test by using a validated confidence questionnaire. Cronbach’s α was calculated for all clusters. Changes between pre- and post-test were compared by using the matched-pair t-test, binomial distribution for exact significance test and a calculation of effect sizes (Cohen’s d). Results A statistically significant improvement was exhibited in overall confidence (mean Δ: 0.34; p<0.0001; d: 0.89) as well as in four more specific domains of clinical care, with the area of identifying and evaluating trauma-related diagnoses and disability showing the most prominent improvement (mean Δ: 0.47; p<0.0001; d: 1.00). Conclusions This VP-system can lead to physicians’ improvement of confidence in providing transcultural clinical care for traumatized refugee patients. Further research is required to investigate improvement in actual performance and cognitive outcomes with several VPs and in a long-term effect perspective."
https://openalex.org/W2088649125,"The enteric nervous system arises from neural crest-derived cells (ENCCs) that migrate caudally along the embryonic gut. The expression of ion channels by ENCCs in embryonic mice was investigated using a PCR-based array, RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry. Many ion channels, including chloride, calcium, potassium and sodium channels were already expressed by ENCCs at E11.5. There was an increase in the expression of numerous ion channel genes between E11.5 and E14.5, which coincides with ENCC migration and the first extension of neurites by enteric neurons. Previous studies have shown that a variety of ion channels regulates neurite extension and migration of many cell types. Pharmacological inhibition of a range of chloride or calcium channels had no effect on ENCC migration in cultured explants or neuritogenesis in vitro. The non-selective potassium channel inhibitors, TEA and 4-AP, retarded ENCC migration and neuritogenesis, but only at concentrations that also resulted in cell death. In summary, a large range of ion channels is expressed while ENCCs are colonizing the gut, but we found no evidence that ENCC migration or neuritogenesis requires chloride, calcium or potassium channel activity. Many of the ion channels are likely to be involved in the development of electrical excitability of enteric neurons."

MGUS patients showed great variability in serum thermogram characteristics, which depended on the IgG, IgA or IgM isotypes and/or the κ or λ light chains. Thermogram feature parameters distinguished patients with MGUS from healthy people. Serum samples, named as non-MGUS, were also collected from patients with subjacent immunological pathologies who were discarded of having MGUS through serum immunofixation.

This retrospective study examined Veterans Health Administration (VHA) beneficiaries with HIV (ICD-9-CM codes 042 or V08) receiving expert care (defined as HIV-1 RNA viral load and CD4 cell count tests occurring within one week of each other) at VHA facilities from October 1, 2006, to September 30, 2008. Patients were ≥18 years old and continuous VHA users for at least 24 months after entry into expert care. Retention measures included: Annual Appointments (≥2 appointments annually at least 60 days apart), Missed Appointments (missed ≥25% of appointments), Infrequent Appointments (>6 months without an appointment), and Missed or Infrequent Appointments (missed ≥25% of appointments or >6 months without an appointment). Multivariable nominal logistic regression models were used to determine associations between retention measures and outcomes. Overall, 8,845 patients met study criteria. At baseline, 64% of patients were virologically suppressed and 37% had a CD4 cell count >500 cells/mm3. At 24 months, 82% were virologically suppressed and 46% had a CD4 cell count >500 cells/mm3. During follow-up, 13% progressed to AIDS, 48% visited the emergency department (ED), 28% were hospitalized, and 0.3% died. All four retention measures were associated with virologic suppression and antiretroviral therapy initiation at 24 months follow-up. Annual Appointments correlated positively with CD4 cell count >500 cells/mm3. Missed Appointments was predictive of all primary and secondary outcomes, including CD4 cell count ≤500 cells/mm3, progression to AIDS, ED visit, and hospitalization. Missed Appointments was the only measure to predict all primary and secondary outcomes.

In contrast to this view, we show that, in the polyglutamine disease spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy, proteolysis of the mutant androgen receptor (AR) is a late event.

Moreover, transgenic mice expressing a mutant N-terminal AR fragment (18Abel A. Walcott J. Woods J. Duda J. Merry D.E. Expression of expanded repeat androgen receptor produces neurologic disease in transgenic mice.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 107-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) show substantially greater severity of disease symptoms than mice expressing full-length AR protein from the same promoter (7Chevalier-Larsen E.S.

Neurosci. 2004; 24: 4778-4786Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), suggesting a model in which cleavage of the AR promotes the adoption of a misfolded, toxic, aggregation-prone conformation. However, the role of cleavage and the protease responsible for mutant AR proteolysis are still undetermined. Substantial evidence suggests that soluble, aggregated species of misfolded polyglutamine-expanded proteins are likely responsible for neuronal dysfunction and toxicity, whereas nuclear inclusions represent the sequestration of such species into non-toxic, neuroprotective entities (19Arrasate M.

Motoneuronal cell death is not correlated with aggregate formation of androgen receptors containing an elongated polyglutamine tract.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 133-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the presence of inclusions containing aggregated polyglutamine species reveals the inability of the cell to efficiently degrade the misfolded protein and is indicative of a pathological process. Given this background, we hypothesized that the mutant AR is cleaved to form a toxic, soluble, N-terminal AR fragment and set out to understand the timing and location of mutant AR proteolysis. Such an understanding would likely reveal a new target for therapeutic intervention. In our studies described here, we used a combination of imaging and biochemical approaches to reveal a novel view of the aggregation process in SBMA, one in which inclusions are formed from full-length AR protein and cleavage of the mutant AR occurs only after it is integrated into an inclusion. Our results also indicate that soluble aggregation species consist of full-length AR protein. Proteolysis of the mutant AR to produce the N-terminal fragments observed in nuclear inclusions is a late event, occurring after the mutant AR has already become SDS-insoluble. We show that ubiquitin is present on the same aggregated AR species that become proteolyzed, a process that we show requires proteasomal activity. Finally, the conformation-specific antibody 3B5H10, previously shown to predict risk of death in models of Huntington disease (22Miller J. Arrasate M. Brooks E. Libeu C.P. Legleiter J. Hatters D.

DNA sequences encoding CFP-AR25Q-YFP, CFP-AR65Q-YFP, and CFP-AR121Q-YFP (a kind gift from Marc Diamond, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO) were excised with NheI/FspI and ligated into the pTRE2 plasmid (Clontech) cut with NheI/EcoRV. To create single labeled YFP-tagged AR-encoding plasmids, the CFP/YFP-pTRE2-AR plasmids created above along with untagged pTRE2-AR plasmid were digested with NheI and BstBI, and the 5′- or 3′-AR-containing fragments were swapped. Transfection of Tet-On PC12 cells (Clontech) was executed with each CFP/YFP-pTRE2-AR or YFP-pTRE2-AR plasmid and a plasmid conferring hygromycin resistance (pTK-Hygro) using Lipofectamine with Plus Reagent (Invitrogen). Transfected cells were selected in the presence of 200 μg/ml hygromycin (Invitrogen), and single colonies were isolated and screened for AR protein expression by induction with 0.5 μg/ml doxycycline (Clontech). Positive clones were verified by Western blotting (using AR(H280) antibody) and by direct observation of fluorescence produced by the CFP and YFP tags. Genomic DNA was extracted from positive clones, and the CAG repeat length was verified by PCR and sequencing analysis. The concentration of doxycycline required to induce equivalent levels of AR protein between cell lines was determined. PC12 cells inducibly expressing human AR were maintained as described (13Walcott J.L. Merry D.E. Ligand promotes intranuclear inclusions in a novel cell model of spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50855-50859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). AR expression was induced in cells containing double fluorescently labeled AR with 121 glutamines (DLAR121Q) or DLAR25Q with 10 ng/ml doxycycline or in cells containing unlabeled AR with 112 glutamines (AR112Q) or AR10Q with 500 ng/ml doxycycline. 5α-Dihydrotestosterone (DHT; Sigma) was resuspended in ethanol, and cells were treated with a final concentration of 10 nm DHT. Cells were treated with epoxomicin (Sigma-Aldrich) at 10, 25, or 50 nm (in dimethyl sulfoxide) for 48 h. AR expression was induced in PC12 cells (AR112Q and AR10Q), and cells were treated with DHT (10 nm) for 7 days. Cells were lysed with radioimmune precipitation assay lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.15 m NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, and protease inhibitors), and 750 μg of protein from each cell line was incubated overnight at 4 °C with or without 1.5 μg of antibody (AR(H280) or AR(C19)). Capture of the immunoprecipitated AR was carried out using Protein G Dynabeads (Invitrogen) for 30–60 min at room temperature followed by separation from the unbound sample using a Dynal magnet. Each sample was split into 250- and 500-μg-equivalent portions (1:2 ratio). The 500-μg portion was treated with 100% formic acid while rotating for 15 min at 37 °C. The eluate was separated from the Dynabeads, evaporated overnight in a vacuum centrifuge, and resuspended in 2× Laemmli buffer. Sample pH was neutralized by adding 1–5 μl of 1.5 m Tris buffer, pH 8. The 250-μg portion was eluted from the Dynabeads with 2× Laemmli buffer, and samples were boiled for 5 min. Samples were evaluated by SDS-PAGE and Western blot using AR-318 (1:500). Following AR-318 detection, membranes were probed for rabbit IgG (using anti-rabbit secondary antibody) to identify the IgG heavy chain of the antibody used for immunoprecipitation. PC12 cells expressing AR112Q, AR with 111 glutamines fused with YFP at the C terminus (AR111Q-YFP), or AR25Q-YFP were grown for 10 days in the presence of 750 ng/ml doxycycline and 10 nm DHT and for an additional 2 days in the presence of 10 nm DHT. Cells were harvested and lysed with 2% SDS lysis buffer. AR inclusions were isolated by ultracentrifugation at 60,000 rpm for 2 h 45 min in a 70.1 Ti rotor at room temperature. Pellets were washed with 2% SDS lysis buffer and centrifuged again at 60,000 rpm for 2h 45 min. Pellets were either dissolved in 2× Laemmli buffer or treated with a 1:1 mixture of trifluoroacetic acid (Thermo Scientific) and 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoro-2-propanol (Sigma-Aldrich) (TFA:HFIP) for 2 h at room temperature. TFA:HFIP was evaporated from the samples using a SpeedVac, the sample was dissolved in 2× Laemmli buffer, and the pH was adjusted with 1.5 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.8. Samples were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membrane. The membrane was probed with anti-GFP (1:1000) (Clontech), AR(N-20) (1:1000) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or AR(441) (1:500) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) antibody. PC12 cells, primary neuronal cultures, and mouse tissue sections were fixed and stained as described previously (11Montie H.L. Cho M.S. Holder L. Liu Y. Tsvetkov A.S. Finkbeiner S. Merry D.E.

Briefly, protein lysates were electrophoresed on a 12-cm-long, 8-mm-thick 1% agarose gel containing 0.1% SDS (in 375 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.8) at 100 V at 4 °C. Proteins were transferred to a PVDF membrane at 200 mA for 1.5 h using a semidry transfer apparatus (Owl HEP Semidry Electroblotting Systems, Thermo Scientific) followed by Western analysis using antibody AR(441) (1:100), 3B5H10 (1:10,000), or AR(H280) (1:1000). DLAR121Q PC12 cells were plated on poly-d-lysine-coated glass bottom dishes (MatTek Corp., Ashland, MA) and maintained as described (13Walcott J.L. Merry D.E.

After 72 h, medium was replaced with Opti-MEM I (Gibco) containing 12.5 mm additional HEPES (Sigma), 5% horse serum, 2.5% fetal bovine serum (Gibco), 10 ng/ml doxycycline, and 10 nm DHT. Each plate was then mounted on the Zeiss Axiovert 200M inverted microscope (Carl Zeiss Microimaging, Inc.), and each field was imaged in four 1-μm increments every 2 h for 20 h. Both YFP and CFP fluorescence emissions as well as differential interference contrast images were captured at each time point using MetaMorph image acquisition and analysis software (Molecular Devices, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). 2-μm z-stacks were compiled as maximum intensity projection images for each time point and for each channel. Adeno-associated viruses containing C-terminal FLAG-tagged human AR (111-CAG or 25-CAG) were created as described (27Montie H.L. Pestell R.G. Merry D.E. SIRT1 modulates aggregation and toxicity through deacetylation of the androgen receptor in cell models of SBMA.J. Neurosci. 2011; 31: 17425-17436Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Briefly, adeno-associated virus (AAV) cis plasmids carrying AR with 111 or 25 CAGs and containing N-terminal nuclear localization signal (NLS; ×3) to ensure nuclear localization were co-transfected with Trans (H21) and Adenovirus Helper (δ6) into HEK293T cells using calcium/phosphate transfection. After 5 days, cells were lysed by repeated freeze/thaw cycles to release viral particles followed by centrifugation to remove cellular debris. The optimum volume of cell lysate to attain effective and equivalent infection of motor neurons in primary dissociated spinal cord cultures was determined by serial dilution infections of primary cultures and immunostaining for AR (AR-318) and neurofilament heavy chain (SMI32) to identify motor neurons. Dissociated spinal cord cultures were established according to Roy et al. (28Roy J. Minotti S. Dong L. Figlewicz D.A. Durham H.D.

Briefly, spinal cords from non-transgenic 13.5-day-old mouse embryos were dissected on ice in dissection medium (0.1% dextrose, 2% sucrose, 6.8 mm NaCl, 0.27 mm KCl, 8.4 μm Na2HPO4, 11 μm KH2PO4, and 9.9 mm HEPES), pooled, dissociated with trypsin, plated on poly-d-lysine (Sigma)-coated German glass coverslips (Chemglass Life Sciences), and cultured for 3 weeks in glial conditioned medium (minimum essential medium, 3% charcoal-stripped horse serum, 35 mm NaHCO3, 0.5% dextrose, 1% N3, 10 nm 2.5S nerve growth factor). After 3 weeks, cultures were transduced with AAV-NLS-AR111Q-FLAG or AAV-NLS-AR25Q-FLAG for 5 days followed by treatment with 10 μm DHT for 3–18 days. Cultures were then immunostained as described, and motor neurons were identified by size and morphology as well as immunoreactivity with an antibody (SMI32) detecting unphosphorylated neurofilament heavy chain. Experimental procedures utilizing mice were conducted according to the guidelines of the Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare and with the approval of the Thomas Jefferson University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. AR-containing PC12 cells were simultaneously treated with doxycycline to induce AR expression with 10, 25, or 50 nm epoxomicin (Sigma-Aldrich) (in dimethyl sulfoxide) and 10 nm DHT for 48 h. Cells were then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and immunostained for AR epitopes as described above. Spinal cords were dissected from male transgenic mice expressing human AR with either 24 CAGs or 112 CAGs from the prion protein (PrP) promoter at 7.5 weeks (n = 4) and 11 months (n = 4) of age. Nuclear extractions were performed through homogenization of freshly dissected tissue in a hypotonic lysis buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9 at 4 °C, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, and 0.5 mm DTT). Duplicate spinal cords were pooled, and the pooled lysates were centrifuged at 3000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The pellets containing the nuclear extract were then resuspended in 2% SDS lysis buffer (2% SDS, 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, and 150 mm NaCl). 9 mg of spinal cord lysate was concentrated using 30,000-kDa-cutoff Millipore Centricon filters (EMD Millipore) and resolved by SDS-AGE. Western analysis was performed using AR(H280) (1:1000). We and others had previously reported that the intranuclear inclusions found within SBMA tissue and SBMA cell and animal models contain only N-terminal portions of the AR (4Li M. Miwa S. Kobayashi Y.

A cluster randomized controlled trial took place in Guantanamo city, east Cuba. Twelve neighborhoods (about 500 households each) were selected among the ones with the highest Aedes infestation levels in the previous two years, and were randomly allocated to the intervention and control arms. Long lasting ITC (PermaNet) were distributed in the intervention clusters in March 2009. Routine control activities were continued in the whole study area. In both study arms, we monitored monthly pre- and post-intervention House Index (HI, number of houses with at least 1 container with Aedes immature stages/100 houses inspected), during 12 and 18 months respectively. We evaluated the effect of ITC deployment on HI by fitting a generalized linear regression model with a negative binomial link function to these data.At distribution, the ITC coverage (% of households using ≥1 ITC) reached 98.4%, with a median of 3 ITC distributed/household. After 18 months, the coverage remained 97.4%. The local Aedes species was susceptible to deltamethrin (mosquito mortality rate of 99.7%) and the residual deltamethrin activity in the ITC was within acceptable levels (mosquito mortality rate of 73.1%) after one year of curtain use. Over the 18 month observation period after ITC distribution, the adjusted HI rate ratio, intervention versus control clusters, was 1.15 (95% CI 0.57 to 2.34). The annualized cost per household of ITC implementation was 3.8 USD, against 16.8 USD for all routine ACP activities.Deployment of ITC in a setting with already intensive routine Aedes control actions does not lead to reductions in Aedes infestation levels."

Neither growth nor the organ weight or tissue weight to body weight ratio was affected by CO treatment. CO significantly lowered peripheral levels of tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-18, interferon-γ, and nitric oxide and inhibited the expression of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), myeloid differentiation primary response gene (88), myeloid differentiation factor 2, apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase-recruitment domain (ASC), caspase-1, and Nod-like receptor family, pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3). CO also inhibited the activation of nuclear factor-ĸB, inhibited the activity of caspase-1 in small intestine, and ameliorated intestinal edema.

https://openalex.org/W1978328927,"Sustained carrying could result in muscular fatigue of the upper limb. Ten male and ten female subjects were recruited for measurements of isometric arm strength before and during carrying a load for a period of 4 minutes. Two levels of load of carrying were tested for each of the male and female subjects. Exponential function based predictive equations for the isometric arm strength were established. The mean absolute deviations of these models in predicting the isometric arm strength were in the range of 3.24 to 17.34 N. Regression analyses between the subjective ratings of upper limb fatigue and force change index (FCI) for the carrying were also performed. The results indicated that the subjective rating of muscular fatigue may be estimated by multiplying the FCI with a constant. The FCI may, therefore, be adopted as an index to assess muscular fatigue for two-handed carrying tasks."

The mitochondrial genome of S. maritima is a circular molecule of 14,938 base pairs, within which we could identify the typical mitochondrial genome complement of 13 protein-coding genes and 2 ribosomal RNA genes. Sequences resembling 16 of the 22 transfer RNA genes typical of metazoan mitochondrial genomes could be identified, many of which have clear deviations from the standard 'cloverleaf' secondary structures of tRNA. Phylogenetic trees derived from the concatenated alignment of protein-coding genes of S. maritima and >50 other metazoans were unable to resolve the Myriapoda as monophyletic, but did support a monophyletic group of chilopods: Strigamia was resolved as the sister group of the scolopendromorph Scolopocryptos sp. and these two (Geophilomorpha and Scolopendromorpha), along with the Lithobiomorpha, formed a monophyletic group the Pleurostigmomorpha. Gene order within the S. maritima mitochondrial genome is unique compared to any other arthropod or metazoan mitochondrial genome to which it has been compared. The highly unusual organisation of the mitochondrial genome of Strigamia maritima is in striking contrast with the conservatively evolving nuclear genome: sampling of more members of this order of centipedes will be required to see whether this unusual organization is typical of the Geophilomorpha or results from a more recent reorganisation in the lineage leading to Strigamia."
https://openalex.org/W2062713637,"There has been a growing recognition that the narrow linear strips of uncultivated vegetation that lie between roads and agricultural crops, referred to as roadside right-of-ways or verges, can serve as areas for the conservation of wildlife. The features of right-of-ways that should influence the composition of wildlife communities vary considerably. Our goal was to determine what features of right-of-ways increased the conservation potential of right-of-ways for wildlife in a grassland system dominated by agricultural production. We sampled 100 right-of-ways for birds and 92 right-of-ways for small mammals in McDonough and Warren Counties in west-central Illinois. We found that the sizes of right-of-ways and the amount of traffic on the adjacent roads synergistically worked to influence wildlife communities. On roads with low traffic, avian species richness increased rapidly with increased right-of-way width, while on roads with high traffic, avian richness increased only slightly with increasing right-of-way widths. We found that wider roadside right-of-ways (preferably across the road from equally wide right-of-ways) with thicker and taller vegetation had the greatest conservation value for birds and small mammals. The features that enhanced the conservation value of right-of-ways in our study area were uncommon. Efforts to create or enhance these features for the benefit of wildlife would likely face numerous obstacles. Nonetheless, from a grassland conservation perspective, working with stakeholders to implement specific strategies to enhance these often neglected areas may be an effective complement to purchasing and restoring conservation lands away from roads."
https://openalex.org/W1997027207,"Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometers are simple and robust mass spectrometers used for analysis of biologically relevant molecules in diverse fields including pathogen identification, imaging mass spectrometry, and natural products chemistry. Despite high nominal resolution and accuracy, we have observed significant variability where 30–50% of individual replicate measurements have errors in excess of 5 parts-per-million, even when using 5-point internal calibration. Increasing the number of laser shots for each spectrum did not resolve this observed variability. What is responsible for our observed variation? Using a modern MALDI-TOF/TOF instrument, we evaluated contributions to variability. Our data suggest a major component of variability is binning of the raw flight time data by the electronics and clock speed of the analog-to-digital (AD) detection system, which requires interpolation by automated peak fitting algorithms and impacts both calibration and the observed mass spectrum. Importantly, the variation observed is predominantly normal in distribution, which implies multiple components contribute to the observed variation and suggests a method to mitigate this variability through spectrum averaging. Restarting the acquisition impacts each spectrum within the electronic error of the AD detector system and defines a new calibration function. Therefore, averaging multiple independent spectra and not a larger number of laser shots leverages this inherent binning error to mitigate variability in accurate MALDI-TOF mass measurements."
https://openalex.org/W1967990338,"Sociality emerges when the benefits of group living outweigh its costs. While both males and females are capable of strong social ties, the evolutionary drivers for sociality and the benefits accrued maybe different for each sex. In this study, we investigate the differential reproductive success benefits of group membership that males and females might obtain in the promiscuous fruit bat Cynopterus sphinx. Individuals of this species live in flexible social groups called colonies. These colonies are labile and there is high turnover of individuals. However, colony males sire more offspring within the colony suggesting that being part of a colony may result in reproductive benefits for males. This also raises the possibility that long-term loyalty towards the colony may confer additional advantage in terms of higher reproductive success. We used ten seasons of genetic parentage data to estimate reproductive success and relatedness of individuals in the colony. We used recapture data to identify long and short-term residents in the colony as well as to obtain rates of recapture for males and females. Our results reveal that males have a significantly higher chance of becoming long-term residents (than females), and these long-term resident males gain twice the reproductive success compared to short-term resident males. We also observed that long-term resident females are related to each other and also achieve higher reproductive success than short-term resident females. In contrast, long-term resident males do not differ from short-term resident males in their levels of relatedness. Our results re-iterate the benefits of sociality even in species that are promiscuous and socially labile and possible benefits of maintaining a colony."
https://openalex.org/W2047480716,"The contribution of specific factors to bacterial virulence is generally investigated through creation of genetic ""knockouts"" that are then compared to wild-type strains or complemented mutants. This paradigm is useful to understand the effect of presence vs. absence of a specific gene product but cannot account for concentration-dependent effects, such as may occur with some bacterial toxins. In order to assess threshold and dose-response effects of virulence factors, robust systems for tunable expression are required. Recent evidence suggests that the folding free energy (ΔG) of the 5' end of mRNA transcripts can have a significant effect on translation efficiency and overall protein abundance. Here we demonstrate that rational alteration of 5' mRNA folding free energy by introduction of synonymous mutations allows for predictable changes in pneumolysin (PLY) expression by Streptococcus pneumoniae without the need for chemical inducers or heterologous promoters. We created a panel of isogenic S. pneumoniae strains, differing only in synonymous (silent) mutations at the 5' end of the PLY mRNA that are predicted to alter ΔG. Such manipulation allows rheostat-like control of PLY production and alters the cytotoxicity of whole S. pneumoniae on primary and immortalized human cells. These studies provide proof-of-principle for further investigation of mRNA ΔG manipulation as a tool in studies of bacterial pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2329567486,"Contralateral masking is the phenomenon where a masker presented to one ear affects the ability to detect a signal in the opposite ear. For normal hearing listeners, contralateral masking results in masking patterns that are both sharper and dramatically smaller in magnitude than ipsilateral masking. The goal of this study was to investigate whether medial olivocochlear (MOC) efferents are needed for the sharpness and relatively small magnitude of the contralateral masking function. To do this, bilateral cochlear implant patients were tested because, by directly stimulating the auditory nerve, cochlear implants circumvent the effects of the MOC efferents. The results indicated that, as with normal hearing listeners, the contralateral masking function was sharper than the ipsilateral masking function. However, although there was a reduction in the magnitude of the contralateral masking function compared to the ipsilateral masking function, it was relatively modest. This is in sharp contrast to the results of normal hearing listeners where the magnitude of the contralateral masking function is greatly reduced. These results suggest that MOC function may not play a large role in the sharpness of the contralateral masking function but may play a considerable role in the magnitude of the contralateral masking function."
https://openalex.org/W2051383971,"Detection of the JAK2V617F mutation is essential for diagnosing patients with classical myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs). However, detection of the low-frequency JAK2V617F mutation is a challenging task due to the necessity of discriminating between true-positive and false-positive results. Here, we have developed a highly sensitive and accurate assay for the detection of JAK2V617F and named it melting curve analysis after T allele enrichment (MelcaTle). MelcaTle comprises three steps: 1) two cycles of JAK2V617F allele enrichment by PCR amplification followed by BsaXI digestion, 2) selective amplification of the JAK2V617F allele in the presence of a bridged nucleic acid (BNA) probe, and 3) a melting curve assay using a BODIPY-FL-labeled oligonucleotide. Using this assay, we successfully detected nearly a single copy of the JAK2V617F allele, without false-positive signals, using 10 ng of genomic DNA standard. Furthermore, MelcaTle showed no positive signals in 90 assays screening healthy individuals for JAK2V617F. When applying MelcaTle to 27 patients who were initially classified as JAK2V617F-positive on the basis of allele-specific PCR analysis and were thus suspected as having MPNs, we found that two of the patients were actually JAK2V617F-negative. A more careful clinical data analysis revealed that these two patients had developed transient erythrocytosis of unknown etiology but not polycythemia vera, a subtype of MPNs. These findings indicate that the newly developed MelcaTle assay should markedly improve the diagnosis of JAK2V617F-positive MPNs."

In this paper, an extension-based feature modeling approach towards semantically sensitive text clustering is proposed along with the corresponding feature space construction and similarity computation method. By combining the similarity in traditional feature space and that in extension space, the adverse effects of the complexity and diversity of natural language can be addressed and clustering semantic sensitivity can be improved correspondingly. The generated clusters can be organized using different granularities. The experimental evaluations on well-known clustering algorithms and datasets have verified the effectiveness of our approach."
https://openalex.org/W2139647010,"It's known that the members of the TP53 family are involved in the regulation of female reproduction. Studies in mice showed that the TP73 gene (member of this family) plays a role in the size of follicular pool, ovulation rate and maintenance of genomic stability. In the present study we analyzed data from 605 patients with ≤ 37 years attending their first intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). The association between the TP73 polymorphism (rs4648551, A>G) and the following parameters related to ovarian reserve, like age, antral follicular count (AFC), anti-Mullerian hormone levels (AMH) and ovarian response prediction index (ORPI) was evaluated. Our results showed an association of the AA genotype with diminished ovarian reserve (AMH <1, AFC ≤9). Women presenting the AA genotype had a 2.0-fold increased risk for having AMH <1 and AFC ≤9 (OR 2.0, 95% CI 1.23-3.31, P = 0.005). Patients presenting AA genotype had the lowest levels of AMH (P = 0.02), the lowest number of antral follicles (P = 0.01) and the lowest ORPI (P = 0.007). Analyzing the alleles, we can see an enrichment of the A allele in the group of diminished ovarian reserve (OR 1.4, 95%CI 1.02-1.83, P = 0.04). To the best of our knowledge, the present study is the first to analyze this polymorphism in humans for assessing the numbers of ovarian follicles and AMH levels and, therefore, the ovarian reserve. Our findings can contribute to the use of this polymorphism as a potential marker of diminished ovarian reserve."

https://openalex.org/W2073239456,"Maternal gestational weight gain (GWG) is associated with birth weight, obesity, and possibly blood pressure (BP) and hypertension in the offspring. These associations may however be confounded by genetic and/or shared environmental factors. In contrast to previous studies based on non-siblings and self-reported data, we investigated whether GWG is associated with offspring BP and hypertension, in a register-based cohort of full brothers while controlling for fixed shared effects.By using Swedish nation-wide record-linkage data, we identified women with at least two male children (full brothers) born 1982-1989. Their BP was obtained from the mandatory military conscription induction tests. We adopted linear and Poisson regression models with robust variance, using generalized estimating equations to analyze associations between GWG and BP, as well as with hypertension, within and between offspring sibling-pairs.Complete data on the mothers' GWG and offspring BP was obtained for 9,816 brothers (4,908 brother-pairs). Adjusted regression models showed no significant associations between GWG and SBP (β = 0.03 mmHg per 1-kg GWG difference, [95% CI -0.08, 0.14], or DBP (β = -0.03 mmHg per 1-kg GWG difference [95% CI -0.11, 0.05]), or between GWG and offspring's risk of hypertension (relative risk = 1.0 [95% CI 0.99, 1.02], neither within nor between siblings.In this large sibling-pair study, we did not find any significant association between GWG and offspring BP or the risk of hypertension at 18y, when taking genetic and environmental factors shared within sibling pairs into account. Further large sibling studies are required to confirm a null association between GWG and other cardiovascular risk factors."
https://openalex.org/W1966751999,"Background A growing literature suggests underutilization of the primary prevention implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD); thus, factors influencing utilization need to be understood. We performed a comprehensive assessment of patient characteristics and health insurance status among subjects eligible for primary prevention ICD in a tertiary care center. Methods From among a group of patients who met criteria for primary prevention ICD based on left ventricular dysfunction (LVEF ≤ 35%), ICD recipients (n = 110) were compared to ICD non-recipients (n = 110) to identify determinants of ICD implantation. We evaluated demographics, clinical profile including Charlson Comorbidity Index [CCI, categorized as low (≤3) or high (>3)] and health insurance status. Results ICD recipients were younger (62.1±15.0 vs. 68.0±18.2; P = 0.01), with more males (80% vs. 65.5%; P = 0.01), higher NYHA class (II/III: 75.5% vs. 40.2%; P<0.001) and more likely to have supplemental private health insurance (61.8% vs. 46.4%; P = 0.02). CCI was not significantly different between the two groups (low CCI 61.8% vs. 62.7%; P = 0.89). In multivariable analysis, factors independently associated with ICD implantation were male sex (OR, 2.77, [1.31-5.85]; P = 0.01), age<75 (OR, 2.68, [1.30-5.50]; P = 0.01), private insurance (OR, 2.17, [1.08-4.36], P = 0.03) and NYHA Class II/III (OR, 5.91, [2.91-12.01]; P<0.001). Documentation of discussion about primary prevention ICD was absent in the majority (57.2%) of non-recipients. Conclusion In a contemporary urban tertiary care setting, age, sex and heart failure symptom class were associated with ICD utilization, with socioeconomic/insurance status also potentially playing a role. These findings have implications for optimizing appropriate utilization of the prophylactic ICD and warrant follow-up in larger, more diverse populations."
https://openalex.org/W1963730490,"Potassium channels allow the selective flux of K⁺ excluding the smaller, and more abundant in the extracellular solution, Na⁺ ions. Here we show that Shab is a typical K⁺ channel that excludes Na⁺ under bi-ionic, Na(o)/K(i) or Na(o)/Rb(i), conditions. However, when internal K⁺ is replaced by Cs⁺ (Na(o)/Cs(i)), stable inward Na⁺ and outward Cs⁺ currents are observed. These currents show that Shab selectivity is not accounted for by protein structural elements alone, as implicit in the snug-fit model of selectivity. Additionally, here we report the block of Shab channels by external Ca²⁺ ions, and compare the effect that internal K⁺ replacement exerts on both Ca²⁺ and TEA block. Our observations indicate that Ca²⁺ blocks the channels at a site located near the external TEA binding site, and that this pore region changes conformation under conditions that allow Na⁺ permeation. In contrast, the latter ion conditions do not significantly affect the binding of quinidine to the pore central cavity. Based on our observations and the structural information derived from the NaK bacterial channel, we hypothesize that Ca²⁺ is probably coordinated by main chain carbonyls of the pore's first K⁺-binding site."
https://openalex.org/W1993633577,"Functional context for biological sequence is provided in the form of annotations. However, within a group of similar sequences there can be annotation heterogeneity in terms of coverage and specificity. This in turn can introduce issues regarding the interpretation of actual functional similarity and overall functional coherence of such a group. One way to mitigate such issues is through the use of visualization and statistical techniques. Therefore, in order to help interpret this annotation heterogeneity we created a web application that generates Gene Ontology annotation graphs for protein sets and their associated statistics from simple frequencies to enrichment values and Information Content based metrics. The publicly accessible website http://xldb.di.fc.ul.pt/gryfun/ currently accepts lists of UniProt accession numbers in order to create user-defined protein sets for subsequent annotation visualization and statistical assessment. GRYFUN is a freely available web application that allows GO annotation visualization of protein sets and which can be used for annotation coherence and cohesiveness analysis and annotation extension assessments within under-annotated protein sets."
https://openalex.org/W2015868717,"The segregation and maintenance of eye-specific inputs in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) during early postnatal development requires the patterned spontaneous activity of retinal waves. In contrast to the development of the mouse, ferret eye-specific segregation is not complete at the start of stage III glutamatergic retinal waves, and the remaining overlap is limited to the C/C1 lamina of the dLGN. To investigate the role of patterned spontaneous activity in this late segregation, we disrupted retinal waves pharmacologically for 5 day windows from postnatal day (P) 10 to P25. Multi-electrode array recordings of the retina in vitro reveal that the cholinergic agonist epibatidine disrupts correlated retinal activity during stage III waves. Epibatidine also prevents the segregation of eye-specific inputs in vivo during that period. Our results reveal a novel role for cholinergic influence on stage III retinal waves as an instructive signal for the continued segregation of eye-specific inputs in the ferret dLGN."
https://openalex.org/W2070215132,"High-precision radiometric calibration and synchronization compensation must be provided for distributed radar system due to separate transmitters and receivers. This paper proposes a transponder-aided joint radiometric calibration, motion compensation and synchronization for distributed radar remote sensing. As the transponder signal can be separated from the normal radar returns, it is used to calibrate the distributed radar for radiometry. Meanwhile, the distributed radar motion compensation and synchronization compensation algorithms are presented by utilizing the transponder signals. This method requires no hardware modifications to both the normal radar transmitter and receiver and no change to the operating pulse repetition frequency (PRF). The distributed radar radiometric calibration and synchronization compensation require only one transponder, but the motion compensation requires six transponders because there are six independent variables in the distributed radar geometry. Furthermore, a maximum likelihood method is used to estimate the transponder signal parameters. The proposed methods are verified by simulation results."
https://openalex.org/W2092727610,"Networks with dependency links are more vulnerable when facing the attacks. Recent research also has demonstrated that the interdependent groups support the spreading of cooperation. We study the prisoner's dilemma games on spatial networks with dependency links, in which a fraction of individual pairs is selected to depend on each other. The dependency individuals can gain an extra payoff whose value is between the payoff of mutual cooperation and the value of temptation to defect. Thus, this mechanism reflects that the dependency relation is stronger than the relation of ordinary mutual cooperation, but it is not large enough to cause the defection of the dependency pair. We show that the dependence of individuals hinders, promotes and never affects the cooperation on regular ring networks, square lattice, random and scale-free networks, respectively. The results for the square lattice and regular ring networks are demonstrated by the pair approximation."
