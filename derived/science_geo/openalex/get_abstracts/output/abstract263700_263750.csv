https://openalex.org/W1987948271,Anthracene that has been dispersed into atmospheric particulate matter is photooxidized to an array of products reminiscent of oxidation by singlet oxygen in the solution phase. Photooxidation is a more important degradative pathway under ambient conditions than ozonation. Significant disappearance of anthracene also occurs by pathways not involving oxygenation.
https://openalex.org/W1978248492,"Rates of hypolimnetic oxygen depletion can be predictedfrom a knowledge of a lake's phosphorus retention, the average hypolimnetic temperature, and the mean thickness of the hypolimnion. Areal oxygen deficits cannot be used to index lake trophic status because areal calculations do not eliminate the influence of hypo-limnetic morphometry."
https://openalex.org/W2083577646,Green leaves of mature sugar beets infected with Pythium aphanidermatum and cotton infected with Phymatotrichum omnivorum had midday radiant leaf temperatures 3 degrees to 5 degrees warmer than adjacent plants with no sign of disease. The temperature difference persisted under varying conditions of soil moisture and could be used to detect biological stress imposed by these soilborne root-rotting fungi.

https://openalex.org/W1999889518,"Optical patterns in polarized light and x-ray reflections in the low-angle region were used to detect a shift from one liquid crystalline structure to another during polymerization. The polymerization took place in a Iotropic liquid crystal of water and sodium undecenoate, with a structure consisting of cylinders in a two-dimensional hexagonal close packing. After polymerization, a lamellar liquid crystalline structure was obtained."
https://openalex.org/W2044081800,"On 24 January 1978 the Russian satellite Cosmos-954 reentered the atmosphere over northern Canada. By use of high-altitude balloons, the atmosphere was sampled during 1978 up to an altitude of 39 kilometers to detect particulate debris from the reactor on board the satellite. Enriched uranium-bearing aerosols at concentrations and particle sizes compatible with partial burnup of the Cosmos-954 reactor were detected only in the high polar stratosphere."

https://openalex.org/W2016008802,"The Strategic Petroleum Reserve, if filled, will consist of at least 750 million barrels of crude oil stored in Gulf Coast salt domes. It could be the only buffer between the United States and an economic disaster in the event a large part of US oil imports were cut off. Congress has appropriated $7 billion for the reserve since early 1975. It is estimated a total cost of the oil needed to fill the reserve at $19 billion. With a full reserve, the immediate response to a severe shortage would be to start moving crude from the salt dome storage facilities into the pipelines and fleets of coastal tankers that regularly deliver oil to most of the nation's refineries. The vital infusion of oil could be maintained for a half year or longer, thus giving the President a better chance to bring about a resumption of the flow of imports by careful diplomacy or other means. There is less than 90 million barrels of oil in storage today and the flow of oil into the reserve has been drying up. Because of US foreign policy commitments and the possible difficulty of filling the reserve with reducing supplies of petroleum productsmore » demanded by consumers, the reserve may go begging. No oil has been purchased for the reserve since late last year. For the reserve to be filled to its planned capacity by the end of 1986, 250,000 barrels of oil a day must begin flowing into it by November, with this rate to be maintained day in and day out for the next 7 years.President Carter has not mentioned the strategic reserve in any of his energy statements since July. The future of the reserve program looks bad. The best chance that the reserve will be filled may lie in the gradual increase in the price of gasoline and other petroleum products resulting from the rising cost of imported oil and the phased decontrol of domestic crude oil prices.
