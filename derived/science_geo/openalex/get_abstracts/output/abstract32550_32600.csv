https://openalex.org/W2066124462,"A specific assay has been developed for a blood-borne non-A, non-B hepatitis (NANBH) virus in which a polypeptide synthesized in recombinant yeast clones of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) is used to capture circulating viral antibodies. HCV antibodies were detected in six of seven human sera that were shown previously to transmit NANBH to chimpanzees. Assays of ten blood transfusions in the United States that resulted in chronic NANBH revealed that there was at least one positive blood donor in nine of these cases and that all ten recipients seroconverted during their illnesses. About 80 percent of chronic, post-transfusion NANBH (PT-NANBH) patients from Italy and Japan had circulating HCV antibody; a much lower frequency (15 percent) was observed in acute, resolving infections. In addition, 58 percent of NANBH patients from the United States with no identifiable source of parenteral exposure to the virus were also positive for HCV antibody. These data indicate that HCV is a major cause of NANBH throughout the world."
https://openalex.org/W2055257235,"The discovery that the AP-1 family of enhancer binding factors includes a complex of the cellular Fos (cFos) and cellular Jun (cJun) proteins established a direct and important link between oncogenesis and transcriptional regulation. Homodimeric cJun protein synthesized in vitro is capable of binding selectively to AP-1 recognition sites, whereas the cFos polypeptide is not. When cotranslated, the cFos and cJun proteins can form a stable, heterodimeric complex with the DNA binding properties of AP-1/cJun. The related proteins Jun B and vJun are also able to form DNA binding complexes with cFos. Directed mutagenesis of the cFos protein reveals that a leucine repeat structure is required for binding to cJun, in a manner consistent with the proposed function of the ""leucine zipper."" A novel domain adjacent to, but distinct from, the leucine repeat of cFos is required for DNA binding by cFos-cJun heterodimers. Thus experimental evidence is presented that leucine repeats can mediate complex formation between heterologous proteins and that promotes further understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the function of two proto-oncogene products."
https://openalex.org/W2045412127,"The protein products of the fos and jun proto-oncogenes form a heterodimeric complex that participates in a stable high affinity interaction with DNA elements containing AP-1 binding sites. The effects of deletions and point mutations in Fos and Jun on protein complex formation and DNA binding have been examined. The data suggest that Fos and Jun dimerize via a parallel interaction of helical domains containing a heptad repeat of leucine residues (the leucine zipper). Dimerization is required for DNA binding and results in the appropriate juxtaposition of basic amino acid regions from Fos and Jun, both of which are required for association with DNA."
https://openalex.org/W1513979636,"We reported previously that the ADP-ribosyltransferase in C1 and D botulinum toxins specifically catalyzes ADP-ribosylation of an Mr 22,000 guanine nucleotide-binding protein and that this substrate named Gb (b = botulinum) has an amino acid sequence homologous to that deduced from the rho gene (Narumiya, S., Sekine, A., and Fujiwara, M. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 17255-17257). In this study we have determined the amino acid sequence at its ADP-ribosylation site. Purified substrate was [32P]ADP-ribosylated by C1 botulinum toxin and digested with trypsin. The radioactive peptides were isolated by reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography and digested further either with protease V8, with proteases V8 and thermolysin, or with proline endopeptidase and thermolysin. By this procedure three radioactive peptides were obtained, and their amino acid sequences were X-Tyr-Val-Ala-Asp-Ile-Glu, X-Tyr, and Val-Phe-Glu-X-Tyr in which no amino acid peak was found in X. During the sequencing the radioactivity quantitatively adhered to the sequencing filter and was not eluted with either of the identified amino acid residues. Analysis of the protein without the ADP-ribosylation yielded the corresponding sequence as Thr-Val-Phe-Glu-Asn-Tyr which corresponds to Thr37-Tyr42 in the amino acid sequence deduced from the Aplysia rho gene. These results strongly suggest that the asparagine residue is the ADP-ribosylation site in the rho gene product. This ADP-ribose protein bond was stable in 0.5 M hydroxylamine at pH 7.5 at 37 degrees C for at least 5 h. The ADP-ribosylation of this protein affected neither its GTPase- nor its [35S]guanosine 5'-O-thiotriphosphate-binding activity."
https://openalex.org/W1532539996,"Glucocorticoid hormones kill immature thymocytes by activating a self-destructive process that involves extensive DNA fragmentation. It has been demonstrated that thymocyte suicide is dependent on an early, sustained increase in cytosolic Ca2+ concentration, and new protein synthesis, but the biochemical lesion that leads to cell death has not been established. To determine whether endonuclease activation or activation of another Ca2+-dependent process could mediate cell killing, we treated thymocytes with the glucocorticoid methylprednisolone in the presence of inhibitors of various Ca2+-dependent degradative enzymes. The role of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, an enzyme known to be activated by DNA damage, was also assessed. Glucocorticoid-induced chromatin cleavage and cell killing were blocked by the endonuclease inhibitor aurintricarboxylic acid, whereas inhibitors of other Ca2+-dependent degradative processes or of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase did not abrogate cell death. In addition, stimulation of thymocyte DNA fragmentation by the Ca2+ ionophore A23187 resulted in cell killing that could be blocked by the endonuclease inhibitor. Together, our results suggest that thymocyte suicide is caused by extensive Ca2+-stimulated DNA fragmentation."
https://openalex.org/W2069659862,"The DNA binding protein NF-kappa B has been implicated in gene regulation in B and T lymphocytes. We have found that NF-kappa B also has a central role in virus induction of human beta-interferon (beta-IFN) gene expression. A critical virus-inducible element of this gene, PRDII, behaves interchangeably with the NF-kappa B binding site from the Ig kappa enhancer in both B lymphocytes and virus-infected fibroblasts. Single base substitutions that impair inducibility of the beta-IFN gene in vivo also reduce the binding of NF-kappa B to PRDII in vitro. Virus infection potently activates the binding and nuclear localization of NF-kappa B and, in pre-B lymphocytes, results in the expression of both the beta-IFN gene and the Ig kappa gene. The wide variety of cell types in which beta-interferon can be induced and the divergent set of gene induction processes involving NF-kappa B suggest that this transcription factor plays a broad role in gene regulation as a mediator of inducible signal transduction."
https://openalex.org/W2082103215,A strategy was devised for identifying regions of the mouse genome that are transcriptionally active in a temporally and spatially restricted manner during development. The approach is based on the introduction into embryonic stem cells of two types of lacZ reporter constructs that can be activated by flanking mouse genomic sequences. Embryonic stem cells containing the lacZ constructs were used to produce chimaeric mice. Developmental regulation of lacZ expression occurred at a high frequency. Molecular cloning of the flanking endogenous genes and introduction of these potential insertional mutations into the mouse germ line should provide an efficient means of identifying and mutating novel genes important for the control of mammalian development.
https://openalex.org/W2093939923,"Transcriptional activation of the human interleukin-2 (IL-2) gene, like induction of the IL-2 receptor alpha (IL-2R alpha) gene and the type 1 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1), is shown to be modulated by a kappa B-like enhancer element. Mutation of a kappa B core sequence identified in the IL-2 promoter (-206 to -195) partially inhibits both mitogen- and HTLV-I Tax-mediated activation of this transcription unit and blocks the specific binding of two inducible cellular factors. These kappa B-specific proteins (80 to 90 and 50 to 55 kilodaltons) similarly interact with the functional kappa B enhancer present in the IL-2R alpha promoter. These data suggest that these kappa B-specific proteins have a role in the coordinate regulation of this growth factor-growth factor receptor gene system that controls T cell proliferation."
https://openalex.org/W1748510480,"We have studied binding to collagen of the 59-kDa protein present in most connective tissues. Collagen fibril formation, measured as increasing turbidity, was markedly retarded and reduced by the presence of small amounts of this protein. This was true for both collagen I and collagen II. The effect was also observed when pepsin-treated collagens were used, indicating that interaction with the telopeptides is not involved. The proportion of collagen precipitated in the assay was not or only marginally reduced. Thus, the altered optical properties indicate that structurally different fibrils are formed in the presence of the 59-kDa protein. The 59-kDa protein bound to collagen I or collagen II that had been insolubilized on polystyrene 96-well microtiter plates, as measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Analogously, binding to the collagens was demonstrated for the PG-S2 low Mr proteoglycan, previously shown only to inhibit collagen fibrillogenesis. The two matrix components showed similar strength of binding, i.e. Kd 35 nM for the 59-kDa protein and 16 nM for PG-S2 at 20 degrees C. The results do not reveal if the collagen interaction site of the 59-kDa protein is different from that of PG-S2. Our observations do, however, suggest that the 59-kDa protein, as well as PG-S2, have functions related to the regulation of collagen organization in tissues."
https://openalex.org/W1552121147,"The distribution of apolipoprotein A-I, apolipoprotein D, lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase, and cholesteryl ester transfer protein in fasting normal human plasma was determined by two-dimensional electrophoresis followed by immunoblotting. The synthesis and transfer of labeled cholesteryl esters generated in plasma briefly incubated with [3H]cholesterol-labeled fibroblasts was followed in terms of the lipoprotein species containing these antigens. Following the early appearance of labeled free cholesterol in two pre beta-migrating apolipoprotein A-I species (Castro, G. R., and Fielding, C. J. (1988) Biochemistry 27, 25-29), labeled esters were first detected, after a 2-min delay, in a third pre beta-migrating species which also contained apolipoprotein D, lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase, and cholesteryl ester transfer protein. Pulse-chase experiments determined that label generated in this fraction was the precursor of at least a major part of labeled cholesteryl esters in the bulk of alpha-migrating high density lipoprotein. Over the maximum time course of these experiments (15 min, 37 degrees C), less than 10% of labeled cholesteryl esters were recovered in low or very low density lipoproteins separated by electrophoresis, immunoaffinity, or heparin-agarose chromatography. These data suggest channeling of cell-derived cholesterol and cholesteryl esters derived from it through a preferred pathway involving several minor pre beta-migrating lipoproteins to alpha-migrating high density lipoprotein."
https://openalex.org/W1897146683,"Abstract Five lines of transgenic mice, which had integrated the human apolipoprotein (apo) A-I gene and various amounts of flanking sequences, were established. Normally, apoA-I is expressed mainly in liver and intestine, but all of the transgenic lines only expressed apoA-I mRNA in liver, strongly suggesting that 256 base pairs of 5'-flanking sequence was sufficient for liver apoA-I gene expression but that 5.5 kilobase pairs was not sufficient for intestinal expression. Mean plasma levels of human apoA-I varied in different lines from approximately 0.1 to 200% of normal mouse levels. This was not dependent on the amount of flanking sequence. Lipoprotein levels were studied in detail in one of the lines with a significantly increased apoA-I pool size. In one study, the total plasma apoA-I level (mouse plus human) was 381 +/- 43 mg/dl in six animals from this line, compared to 153 +/- 17 mg/dl in matched controls. Total and high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels were increased 60% in transgenic animals, compared to controls (total cholesterol: 125 +/- 12 versus 78 +/- 13 mg/dl, p = 0.0001; HDL-C 90 +/- 7 versus 55 +/- 11 mg/dl, p = 0.0001). The molar ratio of HDL-C/apoA-I was significantly lower in transgenic animals, 17 +/- 1 versus 25 +/- 2 (p = 0.0001), suggesting the increase was in smaller HDL particles. This was confirmed by native gradient gel electrophoresis. This was not due to aberrant metabolism of human apoA-I in the mouse, since human apoA-I was distributed throughout the HDL particle size range and was catabolized at the same rate as mouse apoA-I. In another study of 23 transgenic mice, HDL-C and human apoA-I levels were highly correlated (r = 0.87, p less than 0.001). The slope of the correlation line also indicated the additional HDL particles were in the smaller size range. We conclude that human apoA-I can be incorporated into mouse HDL, and excessive amounts increase HDL-C levels primarily by increasing smaller HDL particles, comparable to human HDL3 (HDL-C/apoA-I molar ratio = 18)."
https://openalex.org/W2062921517,"An injection of aphidicolin into early Drosophila embryos inhibits DNA synthesis and nuclear division, while centrosome replication and many other aspects of the mitotic cycle continue. If aphidicolin is injected at nuclear cycle 7–8, the normal migration of nuclei to the embryo cortex is completely inhibited. In most of these embryos, however, centrosomes continue to migrate in a coordinated manner to the cortex, where they reorganize tubulin, actin, and the overlying plasma membrane. Remarkably, the centrosomes that migrate to the posterior pole of such embryos initiate pole cell formation in the absence of nuclei. These observations demonstrate that centrosomes alone are able to direct a major reorganization of the cortical cytoskeleton when they arrive at the surface of the embryo. They also suggest that the coordinated movement of nuclei to the embryo cortex is mediated by forces acting on the centrosome rather than on the nucleus itself."
https://openalex.org/W2065955997,"Drosophila polytene chromosomes contain a surprisingly large amount of terminal N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) residues along their lengths, as determined by staining with a fluorescently tagged lectin, wheat germ agglutinin (FITC-WGA) and by specific radio-labeling with bovine galactosyltransferase and UDP-[3H]galactose. FITC-WGA intensely stains polytene chromosomes in a distinctive banding pattern in which condensed chromatin is brightly labeled and transcriptionally active ""puff"" regions are less intensely stained. Biochemical analyses of galactosyltransferase-radiolabeled chromatin indicates that nearly all of the chromatin-associated GlcNAc moieties exist as single monosaccharide residues attached to protein by an O-linkage (O-GlcNAc). Chromatin is enriched in O-GlcNAc (over 400 pmol/micrograms of chromatin protein) as compared with total nuclei and other cellular compartments. O-GlcNAc moieties are found on a myriad of chromatin proteins that have diverse types of intermolecular associations with other nuclear components."

https://openalex.org/W1571501258,"Abstract Our studies, which are aimed at understanding the catalytic mechanism of the beta subunit of tryptophan synthase from Salmonella typhimurium, use site-directed mutagenesis to clarify the functional roles of several putative active site residues. Although previous chemical modification studies have suggested that histidine 86, arginine 148, and cysteine 230 are essential residues in the beta subunit, our present findings that beta subunits with single amino acid replacements at these positions have partial activity show that these 3 residues are not essential for catalysis or substrate binding. These conclusions are consistent with the recently determined three-dimensional structure of the tryptophan synthase alpha 2 beta 2 complex. Amino acid substitution of lysine 87, which forms a Schiff base with pyridoxal phosphate in the wild type beta subunit, yields an inactive form of the beta subunit which binds alpha subunit, pyridoxal phosphate, and L-serine. We also report a rapid and efficient method for purifying wild type and mutant forms of the alpha 2 beta 2 complex from S. typhimurium from an improved enzyme source. The enzyme, which is produced by a multicopy plasmid encoding the trpA and trpB genes of S. typhimurium expressed in Escherichia coli, is crystallized from crude extracts by the addition of 6% poly(ethylene glycol) 8000 and 5 mM spermine. This new method is also used in the accompanying paper to purify nine alpha 2 beta 2 complexes containing mutant forms of the alpha subunit."
https://openalex.org/W1600965850,"In order to ascertain the role of phospholipase A2 (PLA2) in the release of arachidonic acid for eicosanoid biosynthesis, we have characterized a Ca2+-dependent PLA2 from P388D1 cells, evaluated inhibitors of its activity, and correlated the effects of these inhibitors on prostaglandin (PG) E2 production in the intact cell. The Ca2+-dependent PLA2 has little preference for the polar head group or sn-2 fatty acid of phospholipids, and we have now found that it will hydrolyze 1-alkyl,2-acyl phospholipids, but it does not show a preference for this substrate over other phospholipids. Inhibitor studies with the Ca2+-dependent PLA2 have shown that arachidonic acid is an effective inhibitor. The analogs of natural fatty acids, eicosatetraynoic acid and octadecyleicosaynoic acid, were ineffective as inhibitors of the P388D1 PLA2. However, 7,7-dimethyl-5,8-eicosadienoic acid was as effective an inhibitor (IC50 = 16 microM) as arachidonic acid. Manoalide and its analog, manoalogue, were found to be good inhibitors of the P388D1 PLA2 (IC50 = 16 and 26 microM, respectively). The irreversible inhibitor of the extracellular PLA2, p-bromophenacyl bromide, was a very poor inhibitor of the P388D1 PLA2, apparent IC50 = 500-600 microM. Quinacrine was also ineffective as an inhibitor as was the cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin. On the cellular level, the P388D1 cells respond to various stimuli to produce PGD2 and PGE2 as the major cyclooxygenase products with minor production of PGI2 and thromboxane A2. Similar arachidonic acid metabolite profiles were seen for calcium ionophore A23187, melittin, and platelet-activating factor. Manoalide, manoalogue, and 7,7-dimethyl-5,8-eicosadienoic acid, effective inhibitors of the isolated PLA2, inhibited PGE2 production in intact P388D1 cells 40-85% in the concentration range studied. In contrast, p-bromophenacyl bromide, which is ineffective as an inhibitor of the P388D1 PLA2, did not significantly effect PGE2 production in the concentration ranges used. These results demonstrate that there may be important differences between the intracellular P388D1 PLA2 and the more commonly studied extracellular forms of PLA2. These differences are also observed in the intact cell studies and emphasize the need for the evaluation of inhibitors both in vitro and in vivo using the isolated enzyme and intact cell. This is the first example of studies aimed at correlating the inhibition of a purified intracellular PLA2 with inhibition of prostaglandin production in the intact cell from which it is derived."
https://openalex.org/W1590711006,"Abstract Analogs of ATP and ADP produce a guanine nucleotide-dependent activation of phospholipase C in turkey erythrocyte membranes with pharmacological properties consistent with those of a P2y-purinergic receptor (Boyer, J. L., Downes, C. P., and Harden, T.K. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 884-890). This study describes the interaction of adenosine-5'-O-2-thio[35S] diphosphate ([35S]ADP beta S) with this putative P2y-purinergic receptor on purified plasma membranes prepared from turkey erythrocytes. In binding assays performed at 30 degrees C, the association rate constant of [35S] was 1.1 x 10(7) M-1 min-1 and the dissociation rate constant was 3.8 x 10(-2) min-1. [35S]ADP beta S bound with high affinity (Kd = 6-10 nM) to an apparently homogeneous population of sites (Bmax = 2-4 pmol/mg protein). ATP and ADP analogs (2-methylthio ATP, ADP beta S, ATP, ADP, 5'-adenylyl imidodiphosphate, alpha, beta-methylene adenosine-5'-triphosphate, and beta, gamma-methylene adenosine 5'-triphosphate) inhibited the binding of [35S]ADP beta S with properties consistent with ligand interaction by simple law of mass action kinetics at a single site. The rank order of potency for inhibition of [35S]ADP beta S binding was identical to the potency order observed for these same agonists for stimulation of phospholipase C in turkey erythrocyte ghosts. Guanine nucleotides inhibited [35S]ADP beta S binding in a noncompetitive manner with the following potency order: guanosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) greater than 5'-guanylyl imidodiphosphate greater than GTP = GDP greater than guanosine 5'-O-2-(thiodiphosphate). The data are consistent with the idea that [35S]ADP beta S may be used to radiolabel the P2y-purinergic receptor linked to activation of phospholipase C in turkey erythrocyte membranes. In addition, interaction of radiolabeled agonist with the receptor is modified by guanine nucleotides, providing evidence that an agonist-induced receptor/guanine nucleotide regulatory protein complex may be involved in P2y-receptor action."

https://openalex.org/W2077995348,"Inappropriate expression of the Drosophila pair-rule gene, fushi tarazu (ftz), causes cuticular pattern deletions apparently complementary to those in ftz larvae. We show that the two patterns actually originate similarly, in both cases affecting the even-numbered parasegmental boundaries. The reciprocal cuticular patterns derive from differing patterns of selector gene expression (homoeotic transformations). The primary effect of ectopic ftz activity is to broaden ftz domains by autocatalytic activation of endogenous ftz expression in an additional anterior cell. This activates engrailed (en) and represses wingless (wg) expression, consistent with their proposed combinatorial control by ftz (and other pair-rule genes) to define parasegmental primordia. We propose that the anterior margin of each ftz stripe is normally defined by the posterior even-skipped (eve) boundary."
https://openalex.org/W1570998000,"Human umbilical vein endothelial cells convert linoleic acid to two monohydroxyoctadecadienoic (HODE) acids, 9- and 13-HODE. More 9-HODE than 13-HODE is formed under most conditions. The production of these metabolites is reduced substantially by acetylsalicylic acid, ibuprofen, or arachidonic acid, suggesting that cyclooxygenase may be involved in endothelial HODE synthesis. Incubations lasting up to 4 h indicate that the endothelial cells can convert [U-14C] linoleic acid into at least four additional products, some of which may be derived from the HODE that is formed initially. Radioactive 9- and 13-HODE are produced when the endothelial cells are labeled with linoleic acid and then exposed to thrombin, suggesting that these metabolites also may be formed when the endothelium is activated. If endothelial monolayers grown on micropore filters are incubated with linoleic acid, a substantial amount of the HODE formed accumulates in the basolateral fluid. This suggests that HODE may have extracellular effects, especially within the vascular wall. Furthermore, when 9- or 13-HODE are added, endothelial cultures produce less prostaglandin I2 and convert less 12-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid to its main metabolite, 8-hydroxyhexadecatrienoic acid. Therefore, in addition to extracellular actions, HODE also may have functional effects within the endothelium."
https://openalex.org/W1658557299,"The psbA multigene family in Synechococcus sp. strain PCC 7942 encodes two forms of the D1 protein; Form I, the product of psbAI, differs from Form II, the product of psbAII and psbAIII, at 25 of 360 amino acid positions. D1 is essential for photosynthesis as a protein component of the photosystem II reaction center. Antisera were raised against purified hybrid proteins encoded by psbAI-lacZ and psbAIII-lacZ translational gene fusions that contain the unique amino termini of Form I and Form II, respectively. Form specificity of each antiserum was verified by Western analysis using thylakoid membranes from mutant strains containing only Form I or Form II. Western analysis of thylakoid membranes from wild-type cells cultured at different light intensities detected both forms of D1 in the membrane and showed changes in the ratio of the two forms. The D1 composition of the membrane matched predicted ratios of the forms based on differential gene expression: psbAI is expressed highest at low light, and both psbAII and psbAIII are expressed highest at high light. Along a gradient of light intensity from 5 µE· m−2·s−1 to 482 µE·m−2·s−1, the relative amount of Form I in thylakoid membranes decreased 58%, while the relative amount of Form II increased 60%. Maximum detection of Form I coupled with minimum detection of Form II in membranes from cells harvested at light intensities below 390 µE·m−2·s−1 suggests a central role for Form I in photosystem II. Increased incorporation of Form II into the thylakoid membrane occurred at light intensities reported by others to be photoinhibitory, suggesting that Form II serves a role in adaptation to high light."
https://openalex.org/W1498104101,"A glucose dehydrogenase gene was isolated from Bacillus megaterium IWG3, and its nucleotide sequence was identified. The amino acid sequence of the enzyme deduced from the nucleotide sequence is very similar to the protein sequence of the enzyme from B. megaterium M1286 reported by Jany et al. (Jany, K.-D., Ulmer, W., Froschle, M., and Pfleiderer, G. (1984) FEBS Lett. 165, 6–10). The isolated gene was mutagenized with hydrazine, formic acid, or sodium nitrite, and 12 clones (H35, H39, F18, F20, F191, F192, N1, N13, N14, N28, N71, and N72) containing mutant genes for thermostable glucose dehydrogenase were obtained. The nucleotide sequences of the 12 genes show that they include 8 kinds of mutants having the following amino acid substitutions: H35 and H39, Glu-96 to Gly; F18 and F191, Glu-96 to Ala; F20, Gln-252 to Leu; F192, Gln-252 to Leu and Ala-258 to Gly; N1, Glu-96 to Lys and Val-183 to Ile; N13 and N14, Glu-96 to Lys, Val-112 to Ala, Glu-133 to Lys, and Tyr-217 to His; N28, Glu-96 to Lys, Asp-108 to Asn, Pro-194 to Gin, and Glu-210 to Lys; and N71 and N72, Tyr-253 to Cys. These mutant enzymes have higher stability at 60 °C than the wild-type enzyme. The results of this study indicate that the tetrameric structure of glucose dehydrogenase is stabilized by several kinds of mutation, and at least one of the following amino acid substitutions stabilizes the enzyme: Glu-96 to Gly, Glu-96 to Ala, Gln-252 to Leu, and Tyr-253 to Cys."
https://openalex.org/W1587745196,"Abstract Activation of the neutrophil respiratory burst is thought to involve a translocation and activation of protein kinase C. We report that the presence of Ca2+ during the disruption of unstimulated human neutrophils and cytoplasts resulted in an increase in protein kinase C activity (histone phosphorylation) and immunoreactive protein kinase C species in the particulate (membrane) fraction and a reduction in such activities in the cytosol. This Ca2+-induced translocation of activity was concentration-dependent and occurred at physiologically relevant concentrations of Ca2+ (30-500 nM). The Ca2+-induced membrane association of protein kinase C could be reversed by removal of Ca2+. These findings indicate that the Ca2+ concentration of the extraction buffer can determine the subcellular distribution of protein kinase C in disrupted cells and suggest that the observed location of this enzyme activity in cell fractions may not necessarily reflect the localization in intact cells. These results also raise the possibility that the distribution of protein kinase C between cytosol and membrane is a dynamic equilibrium controlled by levels of free Ca2+. Thus, Ca2+ might regulate distribution as well as activation of protein kinase C."
https://openalex.org/W1639013603,"Abstract Cecropin D was synthesized by solid-phase methods and shown to be homogeneous and of correct composition and molecular weight. It was indistinguishable from natural cecropin D and constitutes a structure proof for this peptide. Several analogs of cecropin D were synthesized and used to draw conclusions about the structural features contributing to antibacterial activity. They included [Lys1]cecropin D, [Gln3, Leu4] cecropin D, and cecropin D-(9-37). It was concluded that a strongly basic NH2-terminal segment is a prerequisite for antibacterial activity. A hybrid analog cecropin A-(1-11) D-(12-37) was designed and predicted to have enhanced potency. It was found to be 5 to 55 times as active as cecropin D against six of the bacteria tested and was slightly more active than cecropin A. However, against Bacillus subtilis Bs11 the analog was 6 times more active than cecropin A."
https://openalex.org/W1480425469,"The effect of substrate on LM2 reduction was examined using a reconstituted system containing dilauroylphosphatidylcholine, NADPH-cytochrome P-450 reductase, and cytochrome P-450 LM2 in a 160:1.5:1 molar ratio. In general, most substrates increased the rate constants of both the first and second phases of reduction as well as the fraction of LM2 reduced in the first phase. The correlation between the high spin content of the cytochrome and each of these kinetic parameters was weaker than expected if spin state controlled LM2 reduction. Further, substrate was shown to exert a rapid effect on both the high spin content and stimulation of reduction indicating that the low spin to high spin shift cannot be responsible for the slow phase of reduction for this particular isoform. Cytochrome P-450 reduction was also examined in both phospholipid-containing and soluble systems where the LM2 and reductase were not present as a preformed complex. In these systems the reactions were substantially slower than with the standard reconstituted system. Addition of substrate enhanced the rate of reduction, indicating that the rate of association between LM2 and the reductase was increased by substrate addition. The strong correlation between the rate of LM2 reduction in a preformed complex and the logarithm of the rate of LM2 and reductase association implicates the rate of functional complex formation as the factor controlling the slow phase of reduction."
https://openalex.org/W1535109335,"Bacillus subtilis glutamine P-Rib-PP amidotransferase contains a [4Fe-4S] cluster which is essential for activity. The enzyme also undergoes removal of 11 NH2-terminal residues from the primary translation product in vivo to form the active enzyme. It has been proposed that oxidative inactivation of the FeS cluster in vivo is the first step in degradation of the enzyme in starving cells. Four mutants of amidotransferases that alter cysteinyl ligands to the FeS cluster or residues adjacent to them have been prepared by site-directed mutagenesis, expressed in Escherichia coli, and characterized (Makaroff, C. A., Paluh, J. L., and Zalkin, H. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 11416-11423). These mutations were integrated into the B. subtilis chromosome in place of the normal purF gene. Inactivation and degradation in vivo of wild type and mutant amidotransferases were characterized in these integrants. Mutants FeS1 (C448S) and FeS2 (C451S) failed to form active enzyme, assemble FeS clusters, or undergo NH2-terminal processing. The immunochemically cross-reactive protein produced by both mutants was degraded rapidly (t1/2 = 16 min) in exponentially growing cells. In contrast the wild type enzyme was stable in growing cells, and activity and cross-reactive protein were lost from glucose-starved cells with a t1/2 of 57 min. Mutant FeS3 (F394V) contained an FeS cluster and was processed normally, but had only about 40% of normal specific activity. The FeS3 enzyme was also inactivated by reaction with O2 in vitro about twice as fast as the wild type. The amidotransferase produced by the FeS3 integrant was stable in growing cells but was inactivated and degraded in glucose-starved cells more rapidly (t1/2 = 35 min) than the wild type enzyme. Mutant FeS4 (C451S, D442C) also contained an FeS cluster and was processed; the enzyme had about 50% of wild type-specific activity and reacted with O2 in vitro at the same rate as the wild type. Inactivation and degradation of the FeS4 mutant in vivo in glucose-starved cells proceeded at a rate (t1/2 = 45 min) that was somewhat faster than normal. The correlation between absence of an FeS cluster or enhanced lability of the cluster to O2 and increased degradation rates in vivo supports the conclusions that stability of the enzyme in vivo requires an intact FeS cluster and that O2-dependent inactivation is the rate-determining step in degradation of the enzyme. The fact that mutant FeS3 was processed normally but degraded rapidly argues against a role for NH2-terminal processing in controlling degradation rates."
https://openalex.org/W1479968418,"A protein in the sarcoplasmic reticulum of rabbit skeletal and cardiac muscle was identified because of its ability to bind 125I-labeled low density lipoprotein (LDL) with high affinity after sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. This protein, referred to as the 165-kDa protein, is restricted to striated muscle. It was not detected in 14 other tissues, including several that contain smooth muscle, but it appears in rat L6 myoblasts when they differentiate into myocytes. Immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopic studies revealed that the protein is present throughout the sarcoplasmic reticulum and the terminal cisternae. It binds 45Ca2+ on nitrocellulose blots and stains metachromatically with Stains-all, a cationic dye that stains Ca2+-binding proteins. It does not appear to be a glycoprotein, and it appears slightly larger than the 160-kDa glycoprotein previously described in sarcoplasmic reticulum. The 165-kDa protein binds LDL, beta-migrating very low density lipoprotein, and a cholesterol-induced high density lipoprotein particle that contains apoprotein E as its sole apoprotein with much higher affinity than it binds high density lipoprotein. The protein is stable to boiling and to treatment with sodium dodecyl sulfate, but it becomes sensitive to these treatments when its cystine residues are reduced and alkylated. The protein was purified 1300-foldmore » to apparent homogeneity from rabbit skeletal muscle membranes. It differs from the cell surface LDL receptor in that (1) its apparent molecular weight is not changed by reduction and alkylation; (2) it is present in Watanabe-heritable hyperlipidemic rabbits, which lack functional LDL receptors; (3) binding of lipoproteins is not inhibited by EDTA; and (4) it is located within the lumen of the sarcoplasmic reticulum where it has no access to plasma lipoproteins.« less"
https://openalex.org/W2058766393,"Mature B cells that express surface immunoglobulin (Ig) are usually committed to their original Ig product. It was shown that such a cell can replace its light chain by rearranging and expressing a new light chain from the other allele. Anti-idiotype antibodies were used to isolate idiotypic variants from a surface IgM+lambda+ human B cell tumor line. The variants expressed a new lambda light chain. Both the original and the new lambda transcripts were present in the variant cells, but only the new one was expressed as a protein on the cell surface. Therefore, although the cell exhibited allelic exclusion and had only one Ig receptor at a time, the commitment to a particular light chain gene was reversible."

The data suggest that these lysyl residues are situated within or in close proximity to the hirudin-binding site of human alpha-thrombin."
https://openalex.org/W1491007578,"Abstract The receptors for insulin and epidermal growth factor undergo tyrosine autophosphorylation in response to ligand stimulation, while pp60v-src is an unregulated tyrosine kinase. In this report we show that each of the kinases phosphorylates an exogenous peptide that corresponds to the insulin proreceptor sequence 1142-1153. When the kinases were pre-phosphorylated, saturable Michaelis-Menten kinetics were observed. However, when the kinases had not been pre-phosphorylated biphasic kinetics were observed; at progressively higher substrate concentrations (greater than Km) less substrate phosphorylation was seen. Furthermore, when the kinases had not been pre-phosphorylated kinase autophosphorylation was inhibited at high substrate concentrations. On this basis we postulated that the substrate inhibition of substrate phosphorylation resulted directly from substrate inhibition of kinase autophosphorylation. To test this we designed additional peptides to function specifically as inhibitors of the kinases. Each of the 3 tyrosine residues within the substrate sequence were replaced either by 4-methoxyphenylalanine or phenylalanine, residues structurally similar to tyrosine but unable to accept phosphoryl transfer. Both analogs inhibited insulin and epidermal growth factor receptor autophosphorylation, whereas only the Phe-substituted analog inhibited pp60v-src phosphorylation. These data suggest that autophosphorylation of tyrosine residues near the kinase active site is a generalized mechanism for tyrosine kinase activation and that activation can be selectively blocked by substrates and nonphosphorylatable analogs."
https://openalex.org/W1591861570,"Abstract We have studied the effects of specific amino acid replacements in EF-Tu upon the protein's interactions with guanine nucleotides and elongation factor Ts (EFTs). We found that alterations at the lysine residue of the Asn-Lys-Cys-Asp sequence, the guanine ring-binding sequence, differentially affect the protein's ability to bind guanine nucleotides. Wild type EF-Tu (Lys-136) binds GDP and GTP much more tightly than do many of the altered proteins. Replacing lysine by arginine lowers the protein's affinity for GDP by about 20-fold relative to the change in its affinity for EF-Ts. Substitutions at residue 136 by glutamine (K136Q) and glutamic acid (K136E) further lower the protein relative affinity for GDP by factors of about 4 and 10, respectively. In contrast, replacement of the residue by isoleucine (K136I) eliminates guanine nucleotide binding as well as EF-Ts binding. Apparently, the distortion of this loop by substitution at residue 136 of a bulky hydrophobic residue can hamper the binding for both substrates or disrupt the folding of the protein. All altered proteins except EF-Tu(K136I) are able to bind tRNA(Phe); however, they require much higher concentrations of GTP than wild type EF-Tu. In minimal media, Escherichia coli cells harboring plasmids encoding EF-Tu(K136E) or EF-Tu(K136Q) suffer growth retardation relative to cells bearing the same plasmid encoding wild type EF-Tu. Co-transformation of these cells with a compatible plasmid bearing the EF-Ts gene reverses this growth problem. The growth retardation effect of some of the altered proteins can be explained by their sequestering EF-Ts. These results indicate that EF-Ts is essential to the growth of E. coli and suggest a technique for studying EF-Ts mutants as well as for identifying other guanine nucleotide exchange enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W1550868025,"In vitro phosphorylation of purified human plasma apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) by a recently characterized Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase (Beg, Z. H., Stonik, J. A., and Brewer, H. B., Jr. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 13228-13240) was time-, Ca2+-, and calmodulin-dependent. Maximal phosphorylation of human apoA-I revealed a stoichiometry of approximately 1 mol of PO4/mol of apoA-I. Phosphorylation of apoA-I resulted in an increase of two negative charges and consequently a shift to a more acidic pI for each apoA-I isoform following isoelectrofocusing. Dephosphorylation of 32P-apoA-I with either phosphatase I or a Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent phosphatase was associated with a virtually complete loss of 1 mol of 32PO4/mol of apoA-I. Phosphoamino acid analysis of a purified 32P-peptide established that the phosphorylation occurred on a single serine residue. Automated Edman degradation of the purified 32P-peptide revealed a single amino acid sequence and indicated that phosphorylation occurred on the serine at residue 201 in the apoA-I sequence. ApoA-I was shown to be secreted as a phosphoapolipoprotein by HepG-2 cells as well as primary human hepatocytes. Analysis of HepG-2 cells established that intracellular apoA-I, like secreted apoA-I, is phosphorylated. Dephosphorylation of both secreted and intracellular 32P-apoA-I revealed the loss of radioactivity in the apoA-I protein bands. These data provide the initial description of a post-translational modification involving reversible phosphorylation of extracellular as well as intracellular apoA-I on a serine residue. These combined results suggest that synthesis and secretion of apoA-I as a phosphoapolipoprotein in HepG-2 cells as well as primary human hepatocytes may play an important role in lipoprotein assembly, intracellular transport as well as processing, and lipoprotein secretion."
https://openalex.org/W2162974200,"Administration of different steroid hormones in vivo has distinct and specific effects on the MAO activity of the adrenal medulla. In an effort to reconstitute these effects in defined cells, we have isolated endothelial cells and chromaffin cells from the bovine adrenal medulla and tested each cell type for sensitivity to these steroids. As in the intact animal, we found that endothelial cell MAO activity was stimulated 1.5- to 2.5-fold by 10 μM progesterone, hydrocortisone, and dexamethasone, inhibited by ca. 50% by 17-α-estradiol, but unaffected by testosterone. The type of MAO in the endothelial cells was found to be exclusively of the A type. The chromaffin cells had MAO B exclusively and were inert to treatment with dexamethasone. The mode of action of the various steroids on MAO A activity in endothelial cells seemed to be that of affecting the number of MAO molecules, as binding of [3H]pargyline, an MAO inhibitor, changed in proportion to changes in enzyme activity. Consistently, the kinetic parameters for MAO A showed changes in Vmax but not Km under all conditions. The specificity of steroid action on MAO A activity was also supported by the fact that steroid-induced changes in total cell division ([14C]thy-midine incorporation) and total protein synthesis ([14C]leucine incorporation) were seen after changes in MAO A. We conclude that the differential effects of steroids on MAO activity in the intact adrenal medulla can be reproduced in cultured adrenal medullary endothelial cells but not in chromaffin cells. Therefore we suggest that the action of these steroid hormones on the intact adrenal medulla may be restricted to the endothelial cell component of this tissue.—Youdim, M. B. H.; Banerjee, D. K.; Kelner, K.; Offutt, L.; Pollard, H. B. Steroid regulation of MAO activity in the adrenal medulla. FASEB J. 3: 1753-1759; 1989."
https://openalex.org/W1603094039,"The enzyme content and mRNA level for both urokinase-type and tissue-type plasminogen activators have been explored during the life cycle of the adult mouse mammary gland. Both enzymes were detected, and urokinase-type plasminogen activator was the predominant form. A marked decrease in enzyme content occurred in late gestation and was maintained throughout lactation; upon weaning, the enzyme content returned to the levels found in virgin mice. These effects were entirely accounted for by changes in the respective mRNA concentrations, which were determined with respect to both total tissue RNA and poly(A+) mRNA. Thus, plasminogen activator-catalyzed proteolysis may occur at high levels throughout the life cycle of the mouse mammary gland, except during lactation."
https://openalex.org/W2030238175,"Mixed isotype (E alpha A beta and A alpha E beta) dimers are not found on Ia+ hematopoietic cells, although some pairs (e.g., E alpha A beta d) reach the membrane of transfected cells expressing only the two relevant class II genes. To examine the basis for this difference in potential versus actual Ia molecule expression, we utilized an L cell transfection model more closely resembling the normal condition of multiple class II alpha and beta chain synthesis within a single cell, such that competition among alpha and beta chains could occur. The surface expression of individual Ia dimers was compared with the available class II chains in such cells. Our data indicate that 3- to 5-fold preferences in assembly or transport of the predominant A alpha A beta and E alpha E beta species preclude expression of the mixed isotype E alpha A beta pair under physiologic conditions of balanced chain synthesis, but that asymmetric chain synthesis can lead to the expression of such mixed dimers on the cell surface in biologically significant amounts."
https://openalex.org/W1505536992,"Abstract The reaction of human oxyhemoglobin with mono(3,5-dibromosalicyl)fumarate, produces a derivative specifically acylated at the two lysines beta 82, which can be purified with a 70% yield. The oxygen affinity of this derivative at 37 degrees C at pH 7.4, 0.1 M Cl- is of 12 mm Hg, and is not affected by organic phosphate. In the presence of 5% CO2, the oxygen affinity decreases to 25 mm Hg. In all cases the cooperativity is lowered, with a value of n in the Hill plots near 2. Sedimentation velocity measurements indicate that, contrary to normal hemoglobin, this derivative fails to dissociate into dimers upon exposure to pH 5.5. The stability of the tetrameric structure is probably due to a modification of the beta-beta interface, resulting from electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions introduced in the beta cleft by the fumaryl residues. These new interactions are probably the origin of a new reverse Bohr effect group at alkaline pH. Consistent with the stabilization of the tetrameric structure, the half-time of retention of this compound in the rat is increased 4-fold with respect to that of normal hemoglobin. These characteristics cast a favorable light on the usage of this compound as an oxygen carrier in transfusional and perfusional fluids."
https://openalex.org/W1541794688,"Abstract In Drosophila melanogaster the population of proteasome particles consists of three distinct subclasses. By fractionation of a 40,000 x g supernatant of Drosophila homogenate on a DEAE-Sephacel column, proteasome particles which elute at salt concentrations of 200, 300, and 500 mM KAc can be separated. The proteasomes of all three subfractions sediment at 19 S in sucrose gradients and are shown by two-dimensional gel electrophoretic analysis to possess the same protein content. They differ, however, with respect to their specific proteolytic activity against the substrates benzoyl-Val-Gly-Arg-4-methylcoumaryl-7-amide, succinyl-Leu-Leu-Val-Tyr-4-methylcoumaryl-7-amide, and succinyl-Ala-Ala-Phe-4-methylcoumaryl-7-amide and the degree to which their hydrolytic activity can be enhanced by the addition of 30-110 microM sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). Our data show that the 200 mM proteasome fraction exhibits the lowest basal specific proteolytic activity but can be stimulated most by SDS. The 300 and 500 mM proteasome subfractions, on the other hand possess considerably higher but similar basal specific proteolytic activity. Of these only the proteolytic activity of the 300 mM subfraction against the substrates benzoyl-Val-Gly-Arg-4-methylcoumaryl-7-amide and succinyl-Leu-Leu-Val-Tyr-4-methylcoumaryl-7-amide can be enhanced by SDS. Our data raise the possibility that the different subpopulations reflect structural differences between the proteasome particles, which in turn may result in different in vivo substrate specificities of the proteasome subpopulations."
https://openalex.org/W1544528691,"The B subunit of cholera toxin, a protein which binds specifically to ganglioside GM1 on the cell surface, stimulates DNA synthesis in quiescent Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts as measured by an increase in [3H]thymidine incorporation. Pertussis toxin pretreatment markedly inhibits B subunit-induced DNA synthesis. The inhibitory effects of pertussis toxin were observed even in the presence of insulin which greatly potentiates the mitogenic response to the B subunit. Treatment with either pertussis toxin or insulin did not alter the binding of the B subunit to the cells. The dose-response for pertussis toxin-induced inhibition of DNA synthesis correlated closely with the dose-response for ADP-ribosylation of a 41-kDa membrane protein, suggesting the involvement of a GTP-binding protein that is a substrate for pertussis toxin (Gi) in mitogenesis induced via cross-linking of endogenous gangliosides. Pertussis toxin, in a similar concentration-dependent manner, also inhibited the mitogenic response to unfractionated fetal calf serum and to bombesin in the absence or presence of insulin. The inhibitory effect of pertussis toxin was clearly unrelated to any effects on known G proteins coupled to adenylate cyclase or phospholipase C. In addition, pertussis toxin did not impair the early increase in cytosolic free Ca2+ induced by the B subunit or bombesin. Pertussis toxin-induced inhibition of DNA synthesis could still be observed even when the toxin was added as late as 6 h after addition of the growth-promoting agents. This suggests the involvement of a GTP-binding protein in a late step of the B subunit- and bombesin-mediated pathways of mitogenesis. The possibility that other growth factors bypass this pathway is shown by their lack of sensitivity to pertussis toxin."
https://openalex.org/W1630864454,"The cDNA encoding the 50-kDa subunit of Ca2+/calmodulin (CaM)-dependent protein kinase II from adult rat brain was cloned into the bacterial expression vector pK223-2 and produced in bacteria. Extensive modification of the cDNA was required to express detectable levels of enzyme. The activity of the bacterially expressed kinase was stringently dependent on Ca2+/CaM but did not exhibit cooperative activation kinetics characteristic of the forebrain enzyme and required 10-fold greater amounts of CaM for half-maximal activation. The bacterially expressed enzyme displayed an apparent Km for a synthetic peptide substrate similar to that of the forebrain enzyme (12 and 10 microM, respectively). Limited proteolysis maps of autophosphorylated peptides, and Western blot analysis demonstrated that the bacterially expressed enzyme was structurally and immunologically indistinguishable from the 50-kDa subunit of the rat forebrain holoenzyme. The bacterially expressed enzyme became Ca2+/CaM-independent after Ca2+/CaM-dependent autophosphorylation in a fashion identical to the forebrain enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1502045856,"The structure of the UDP-glucuronyltransferases in microsomes from guinea pig and rat liver was examined in situ by radiation inactivation analysis. The p-nitrophenol conjugating activity of guinea pig microsomes increased at lower doses of radiation; at higher doses (greater than or equal to 36 megarads), activity showed a first order decline yielding a target size of 71 +/- 9 kDa. Treating microsomes with Triton X-100 eliminated the activation seen at lower doses of radiation and yielded a simple exponential decrease in activity which gave a larger target size (95 +/- 18 kDa). A monoexponential decrease in activity was seen in sonicated microsomes, at greater than or equal to 36 megarads. The same response was obtained when the reaction was assayed in the reverse direction. The estrone conjugating activity of guinea pig microsomes was similarly activated at lower doses of radiation and declined at higher doses (greater than or equal to 36 megarads), with a target size of 57 +/- 11 kDa. Allosteric activation of the enzyme by UDP-N-acetylglucosamine was eliminated by lower doses of radiation. Thus, activation of the enzyme by radiation, detergent, sonication, and UDP-N-acetylglucosamine appear to be interdependent. These activations are postulated to be due to the existence of the enzyme in an oligomeric form which can be dissociated into monomers with higher activity. The same biphasic activation-inactivation curves were obtained for p-nitrophenol conjugation in rat liver microsomes. The target sizes were 54 +/- 8 kDa (p-nitrophenol in the forward direction) and 66 +/- 10 kDa (p-nitrophenol in the reverse direction). Thus, the enzyme appears to be smaller in rat liver as compared with guinea pig liver. Lithocholate glucuronidating activity in rat liver microsomes (at greater than 36 megarads) gave a target size of 74 +/- 1 kDa."
https://openalex.org/W1487510935,"Abstract In this study we report that pretreatment of human amniotic (WISH) cells with interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) in the presence of 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA) resulted in the down-modulation of epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptors with respect to both receptor number and affinity. Scatchard analysis of EGF binding in the absence of both IFN-gamma and TPA indicated biphasic binding whereas addition of TPA resulted in the loss of the higher affinity class of sites. Pretreatment with IFN-gamma for 24 h enhanced the TPA-induced inhibition of EGF binding whereas IFN-gamma alone had no effect on binding. Protein kinase C (Ca2+/phospholipid-dependent enzyme) was examined as a possible mediator of IFN-induced EGF-receptor modulation; pretreatment of cells with IFN-gamma affected neither the binding of [3H]phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate to membrane or cytosolic fractions nor the protein kinase C activity, suggesting that IFN-gamma pretreatment did not result in translocation or activation of protein kinase C."

https://openalex.org/W1542976313,"Apoprotein (apo) A-1 binding to large triolein-rich emulsion particles saturated with cholesterol has been examined as a function of the oleic acid content. Six emulsion systems were formed containing 0.3–1.0% (by weight) oleic acid, 82.9–86.3% triolein, 10.6–7.2% egg yolk phosphatidylcholine, and 6.7–5.5% cholesterol. The average emulsion particle diameters calculated from these lipid compositions ranged between 84 and 116 nm. Negative stain electron microscopy of an emulsion containing 1% oleic acid showed a polydisperse population of only large spherical particles with a mean diameter of 116 ± 54 nm. The calculated cholesterol concentrations of the particles surface and core for the six emulsions were 43.3 ± 1.1 and 5.6 ± 0.2 mol%, respectively, and were rather constant. Therefore, when the surface oleic acid concentrations increased from 2.6 to 10.1 mol%, the phospholipid concentration decreased from 55.1 to 45.9 mol%. In the core, oleic acid increased at the expense of triolein. In the range studied a nearly 4-fold increase in the surface oleic acid content produces a similar increase in the binding capacity (N) and reduces the dissociation constant (Kd). The changes in the Kd and N values were linearly dependent on the surface oleic acid concentration. These data show that oleic acid allows more apoA-1 to bind with higher affinity to large emulsion particles saturated with cholesterol."
