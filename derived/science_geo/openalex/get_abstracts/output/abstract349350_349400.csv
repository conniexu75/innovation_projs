A convenient fluorometric procedure is described which permits separate measurement of riboflavin, riboflavin monophosphate, and ribo- flavin dinucleotide. The measurement of the dinucleotide is based on the fact that it has much less fluorescence than riboflavin, and that it can be readily converted into riboflavin monophosphate which exhibits the same fluorescence as riboflavin. Riboflavin is distinguished from its two deriva- tives by its very much greater partition coefficient between beneyl alcohol and water. 2. Data are presented concerning some of the properties of riboflavin dinucleotide, particularly its rate of hydrolysis in acid and the influence of pH and solvent on its fluorescence. 3. Evidence is given that riboflavin monophosphate and dinucleotide account for practically all of the riboflavin of rat kidney. 4. The riboflavin dinucleotide content of liver, kidney, and heart was measured both fluorometrically and enzymatically with concurring re- sults. 5. The data are given for the concentration of the three riboflavin frac- tions in five major rat tissues, both normal and riboflavin-deficient, and for the total riboflavin and dinucleotide concentrations in sixteen others. Free riboflavin was found to be present in quantitatively insignificant amounts. The dinucleotide accounted in general for 70 to 90 per cent of the total riboflavin."

https://openalex.org/W1948916364,"SUMMARY The fermentation of glucose in quickly dried brewers’ yeast proceeds without a break in the rate of fermentation until as much CO1 is produced (in excess of the blank) as corresponds to the complete fermentation of the sugar. At the same time no phosphate esters accumulate; on the contrary, the inorganic phosphate increases somewhat by the breakdown of the stored organic esters. If the ATPase inhibitors are applied to this yeast, the Harden-Young effect appears; the break in the fermentation curve occurs if either free phosphate or the free sugar is exhausted. At the same time, hexose esters, mostly hexose diphosphate, accumulate. The adsorbed ATPase in the quickly dried yeast is inhibited by higher members of the narcotic series: octyl alcohol, phenylurethane, and toluene. If the adsorbed yeast ATPase is brought into solution and partially purified, inhibition no longer occurs. In the presence of arsenate no break in the fermentation rate of the dry yeast is caused by these ATPase inhibitors, because here the ATPase is not needed for dephosphorylation. After sonic vibration of the quickly dried yeast the supernatant solution shows the Harden-Young effect, although it is still not quite complete. Even in this case the narcotics cause a sharper break in the curve, and the accumulation of phosphate esters becomes more pronounced. These facts prove that a removal, destruction, or inhibition of ATPase is responsible for the Harden-Young effect in yeast preparations."

https://openalex.org/W2066112000,"THERE is a growing biological interest in derivatives of pteridine (I: R1, R2, R3, R4 = H) as a source of antagonists for folic acid (I: R1 = OH; R2 = NH2 ; R4 = H; R3 = CH2.NH.C6H4.CO.NHCH(COOH): CH2CH2COOH-p), since this vitamin plays an important part in the growth of certain bacteria and normal and malignant tissue. Thus, Hertz1 has reported that abnormal growth in the chick genital tract evoked by stilbÅ""strol was inhibited by methyl folio acid (I: R1 = OH; R2 = NH2; R4 = CH3; R3 = CH2.NH.C6H4.CO.NHCH(COOH).CH2CH2-COOH-p), which is a powerful antagonist (Martin et al.2), an effect which was reversed by giving folic acid. Little et al.3 and Woll4 have reported inhibition of growth of the Rous chicken sarcoma by means of antagonists, and Bass and Freeman5 found that the inhibition of a lymphoma (lymphoma 6C3HED) in the mouse by mustard gas was to some extent prevented by giving folic acid. Meyer6 claims a favourable clinical effect in acute leukæmia with methylpteroic acid (I: R1 = OH; R2 = NH2; R4 = H; R3 = CH2.N(CH3)C6H4COOH-p). Other antagonists of simple structure are reported by Daniel et al.7."

https://openalex.org/W2077032676,"MUCH work has been done during the last few years by Mirsky and Ris1,2 and by Claude arid Potter3 on thread-like bodies isolated from cell nuclei, such as those of carp erythrocytes and calf thymus. These bodies are sometimes called chromatin threads3 and sometimes, as by Mirsky and Ris, more boldly and specifically “isolated chromosomes"". In this Laboratory we have repeated so far as possible from the published data the work described by these authors. We have not been concerned in the first instance with biochemical studies4 of these threads, but have tried to find if they can properly be regarded as chromosomes. The purpose of this note is to summarize the work leading to our conclusion that the threads are not isolated chromosomes, but are complex fragments of drawn-out nuclei."

https://openalex.org/W1970148842,"FRAZER1 has reported the presence of large globules of stainable fat in the epithelium of the intestinal villi of rats killed three hours after they had received olive oil and water by mouth ; but in the cores of the intestinal villi he could demonstrate very-little fat. However, three hours after the oral adirimistration of comparable amounts of olive oil with added choline, masses of fat were now found in the cores of the villi, whereas the epithelial cells had been more rapidly cleared. The fat which remained in the epithelium was more finely dispersed. We have re-investigated this problem using various procedures, including that described by Frazer. In a small number of animals the pictures which he has described were seen, but our findings in general have not supported his conclusions."

https://openalex.org/W1969546988,"FROM time to time during the last twenty years, articles have been published dealing with the teaching of elementary biology, usually with particular reference to the medical curriculum at the First M.B. (or equivalent) stage. It is true to say, however, that, generally, little change in the teaching syllabus has been brought about ; the plant studies may be of a more physiological nature than twenty years ago and minor changes in the types of animals to be studied may have been made, and yet no change has been really fundamental. In fact, reference to the prospectus of Guy's Hospital Medical School of 1895 shows that little change in the main structure of the course has taken place since then."
