https://openalex.org/W2540090384,"Intermediary metabolism generates substrates for chromatin modification, enabling the potential coupling of metabolic and epigenetic states. Here we identify a network linking metabolic and epigenetic alterations that is central to oncogenic transformation downstream of the liver kinase B1 (LKB1, also known as STK11) tumour suppressor, an integrator of nutrient availability, metabolism and growth. By developing genetically engineered mouse models and primary pancreatic epithelial cells, and employing transcriptional, proteomics, and metabolic analyses, we find that oncogenic cooperation between LKB1 loss and KRAS activation is fuelled by pronounced mTOR-dependent induction of the serine–glycine–one-carbon pathway coupled to S-adenosylmethionine generation. At the same time, DNA methyltransferases are upregulated, leading to elevation in DNA methylation with particular enrichment at retrotransposon elements associated with their transcriptional silencing. Correspondingly, LKB1 deficiency sensitizes cells and tumours to inhibition of serine biosynthesis and DNA methylation. Thus, we define a hypermetabolic state that incites changes in the epigenetic landscape to support tumorigenic growth of LKB1-mutant cells, while resulting in potential therapeutic vulnerabilities. Human tumours with mutations in LKB1 and Kras have a specific hypermetabolic state associated with increased DNA methylation, pointing to potential metabolic and epigenetic vulnerabilities of specific tumours. This paper describes a hypermetabolic state associated with human tumours that carry alterations in the LKB1 (or STK11) tumour suppressor and in KRAS. The oncogenic metabolic activity is associated with increased DNA methylation, which results in, among other things, retrotransposon silencing. The findings provide a link between metabolism and the epigenetic landscape of tumours, and identify potential metabolic and epigenetic vulnerabilities of specific oncogenic alterations."

Renal renin-angiotensin system (RAS) activation is one of the important pathogenic mechanisms in the development of diabetic nephropathy in type 2 diabetes. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of a sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT-2) inhibitor, dapagliflozin, on renal RAS in an animal model with type 2 diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W2546282821,"The optimal foraging strategy in a given environment depends on the number of competing individuals and their behavioural strategies. Little is known about the genes and neural circuits that integrate social information into foraging decisions. Here we show that ascaroside pheromones, small glycolipids that signal population density, suppress exploratory foraging in Caenorhabditis elegans, and that heritable variation in this behaviour generates alternative foraging strategies. We find that natural C. elegans isolates differ in their sensitivity to the potent ascaroside icas#9 (IC-asc-C5). A quantitative trait locus (QTL) regulating icas#9 sensitivity includes srx-43, a G-protein-coupled icas#9 receptor that acts in the ASI class of sensory neurons to suppress exploration. Two ancient haplotypes associated with this QTL confer competitive growth advantages that depend on ascaroside secretion, its detection by srx-43 and the distribution of food. These results suggest that balancing selection at the srx-43 locus generates alternative density-dependent behaviours, fulfilling a prediction of foraging game theory."
https://openalex.org/W2548268704,"South Brazilian organic propolis (OP), which has never been studied before, was assessed and its chemical composition, scavenging potential of reactive oxygen species, antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory activities are herein presented. Based on the chemical profile obtained using HPLC, OP was grouped into seven variants (OP1–OP7) and all of them exhibited high scavenging activity, mainly against superoxide and hypochlorous acid species. OP1, OP2, and OP3 had the smallest minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) against Gram-positive bacteria Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus oralis, and Streptococcus aureus (12.5–100 μg/mL). OP1, OP2, OP3, and OP4 were more effective against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Gram-negative), with MIC values ranging from 100 to 200 μg/mL. OP6 showed anti-inflammatory activity by decreasing NF-kB activation and TNF-α release in RAW 264.7 macrophages, and expressing the NF-κB-luciferase reporter stable gene. Therefore, south Brazilian OP can be considered an excellent source of bioactive compounds with great potential of application in the pharmaceutical and food industry."
https://openalex.org/W2547942656,"Importance The rapid uptake of mobile phones in low and middle-income countries over the past decade has provided public health programs unprecedented access to patients. While programs have used text messages to improve medication adherence, there have been no high-powered trials evaluating their impact on tuberculosis treatment outcomes. Objective To measure the impact of Zindagi SMS, a two-way SMS reminder system, on treatment success of people with drug-sensitive tuberculosis. Design We conducted a two-arm, parallel design, effectiveness randomized controlled trial in Karachi, Pakistan. Individual participants were randomized to either Zindagi SMS or the control group. Zindagi SMS sent daily SMS reminders to participants and asked them to respond through SMS or missed (unbilled) calls after taking their medication. Non-respondents were sent up to three reminders a day. Setting Public and private sector tuberculosis clinics in Karachi, Pakistan. Participants Newly-diagnosed patients with smear or bacteriologically positive pulmonary tuberculosis who were on treatment for less than two weeks; 15 years of age or older; reported having access to a mobile phone; and intended to live in Karachi throughout treatment were eligible to participate. We enrolled 2,207 participants, with 1,110 randomized to Zindagi SMS and 1,097 to the control group. Main Outcome The primary outcome was clinically recorded treatment success based upon intention-to-treat. Results We found no significant difference between the Zindagi SMS or control groups for treatment success (719 or 83% vs. 903 or 83%, respectively, p = 0·782). There was no significant program effect on self-reported medication adherence reported during unannounced visits during treatment. Conclusion In this large-scale randomized controlled effectiveness trial of SMS medication reminders for tuberculosis treatment, we found no significant impact. Trial Registration The trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01690754."
https://openalex.org/W2547591013,"Exosomes are nanometer-scale, cell-derived vesicles that contain various molecules including nucleic acids, proteins, and lipids. These vesicles can release their cargo into adjacent or distant cells and mediate intercellular communication and cellular function. Here we examined the regulation of epithelial sodium channels in mpkCCD cells and distal tubule Xenopus 2F3 cells by exosomes isolated from proximal tubule LLC-PK1 cells. Cultured mpkCCD cells were stained with CTX coupled to a green fluorophore in order to label the cell membranes and freshly isolated exosomes from LLC-PK1 cells were labeled with the red lipophilic dye PKH26 in order to visualize uptake of exosomes into the cells. Single-channel patch clamp recordings showed the open probability of ENaC in Xenopus 2F3 cells and in freshly isolated split-open tubules decreased in response to exogenous application of exosomes derived from LLC-PK1 proximal tubule cells. Active GAPDH was identified within exosomes derived from proximal tubule LLC-PK1 cells. The effect on ENaC activity in Xenopus 2F3 cells was blunted after application of exosomes transfected with the GAPDH inhibitor heptelidic acid. Also, we show GAPDH and ENaC subunits associate in mpkCCD cells. These studies examine a potential role for exosomes in the regulation of ENaC activity and examine a possible mechanism for communication from proximal tubule cells to distal tubule and collecting duct cells."
https://openalex.org/W2542627378,"Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are the major cause of medication-related hospital admissions in older patients living in the community. This study aimed to develop and validate a score to predict ADR-related hospitalization in people aged ≥65 years.ADR-related hospitalization and its risk factors were determined using a prospective, cross-sectional study in patients aged ≥65 years admitted to two hospitals. A predictive model was developed in the derivation cohort (n = 768) and the model was applied in the validation cohort (n = 240). ADR-related hospital admission was determined through expert consensus from comprehensive reviews of medical records and patient interviews. The causality and preventability of the ADR were assessed based on the Naranjo algorithm and modified Schumock and Thornton criteria, respectively.In the derivation sample (mean [±SD] age, 80.1±7.7 years), 115 (15%) patients were admitted due to a definite or probable ADR; 92.2% of these admissions were deemed preventable. The number of antihypertensives was the strongest predictor of an ADR followed by presence of dementia, renal failure, drug changes in the preceding 3 months and use of anticholinergic medications; these variables were used to derive the ADR prediction score. The predictive ability of the score, assessed from calculation of the area under the receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve, was 0.70 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.65-0.75). In the validation sample (mean [±SD] age, 79.6±7.6 years), 30 (12.5%) patients' admissions were related to definite or probable ADRs; 80% of these admissions were deemed preventable. The area under the ROC curve in this sample was 0.67 (95% CI 0.56-0.78).This study proposes a practical and simple tool to identify elderly patients who are at an increased risk of preventable ADR-related hospital admission. Further refinement and testing of this tool is necessary to implement the score in clinical practice."
https://openalex.org/W2546905330,"Clinical application of cyclophosphamide (CP) as an anticancer drug is often limited due to its toxicity. CP is metabolized mainly in the liver by cytochrome P450 system into acrolein which is the proximate toxic metabolite. Many different natural antioxidants were found to alleviate the toxic effects of various toxic agents via different mechanisms. Therefore, the present study aimed at investigating the role of essential oils extracted from fennel, cumin and clove as natural antioxidants in the alleviation of hepatotoxicity induced by CP through assessment of hepatotoxicity biomarkers (AST, ALT, ALP), histopathology of liver tissues as well as other biochemical parameters involved in the metabolism of CP. The data of the present study showed that treatment of male mice with cyclophosphamide (2.5 mg/Kg BW) as repeated dose for 28 consecutive days was found to induce hepatotoxicity through the elevation in the activities of AST, ALT, and ALP. Combined administration of any of these oils with CP to mice partially normalized the altered hepatic biochemical markers caused by CP, whereas administration of fennel, clove or cumin essential oils alone couldn't change liver function indices. Moreover, CP caused histological changes in livers of mice including swelling and dilation in sinusoidal space, inflammation in portal tract and hepatocytes, as well as, hyperplasia in Kuppfer cells. However, co-administration of any of the essential oils with CP alleviated to some extent the changes caused by CP but not as the normal liver. CP was also found to induce free radical levels (measured as thiobarbituric acid reactive substances) and inhibited the activities of superoxide dismutase, glutathione reductase, and catalase as well as activities and protein expressions of both glutathione S-transferase (GSTπ) and glutathione peroxidase. Essential oils restored changes in activities of antioxidant enzymes (SOD, CAT, GR, GST, and GPx) caused by CP to their normal levels compared to control group. In addition, treatment of mice with CP was found to induce the protein expression of CYP 3A4, 2B1/2, 2C6, 2C23. Moreover, the present study showed that essential oils reduced the expression of CYPs 2E1, 3A4 but could not restore the expression of CYP 2C6 and 2C23 compared to CP-treated mice. Interestingly, pretreatment of mice with essential oil of clove was found to restore activities of DMN-dI, AHH, and ECOD which were induced by CP to their normal control levels. It is concluded that EOs showed a marked hepatoprotective effect against hepatotoxicity induced by CP. In addition, co-administration of CP with any of these oils might be used as a new strategy for cancer treatment to alleviate the hepatotoxicity induced by CP."
https://openalex.org/W2542601180,"Background In 2012 there were around 85 million unintended pregnancies globally. Unintended pregnancies unnecessarily expose women to the risks associated with pregnancy, unsafe abortion and childbirth, thereby contributing to maternal mortality and morbidity. Studies have identified a range of potential determinants of unplanned pregnancy but have used varying methodologies, measures of pregnancy intention and analysis techniques. Consequently there are many contradictions in their findings. Identifying women at risk of unplanned pregnancy is important as this information can be used to help with designing and targeting interventions and developing preventative policies. Methods 4,244 pregnant women from Mchinji District, Malawi were interviewed at home between March and December 2013. They were asked about their pregnancy intention using the validated Chichewa version of the London Measure of Unplanned Pregnancy, as well as their socio-demographics and obstetric and psychiatric history. A conceptual hierarchical model of the determinants of pregnancy intention was developed and used to inform the analysis. Multiple random effects linear regression was used to explore the ways in which factors determine pregnancy intention leading to the identification of women at risk of unplanned pregnancies. Results 44.4% of pregnancies were planned. On univariate analyses pregnancy intention was associated with mother and father’s age and education, marital status, number of live children, birth interval, socio-economic status, intimate partner violence and previous depression all at p<0.001. Multiple linear regression analysis found that increasing socio-economic status is associated with increasing pregnancy intention but its effect is mediated through other factors in the model. Socio-demographic factors of importance were marital status, which was the factor in the model that had the largest effect on pregnancy intention, partner’s age and mother’s education level. The effect of mother’s education level was mediated by maternal reproductive characteristics. Previous depression, abuse in the last year or sexual abuse, younger age, increasing number of children and short birth intervals were all associated with lower pregnancy intention having controlled for all other factors in the model. This suggests that women in Mchinji District who are either young, unmarried women having their first pregnancy, or older, married women who have completed their desired family size or recently given birth, or women who have experienced depression, abuse in the last year or sexual abuse are at higher risk of unintended pregnancies. Conclusion A simple measure of pregnancy intention with well-established psychometric properties was used to show the distribution of pregnancy planning among women from a poor rural population and to identify those women at higher risk of unintended pregnancy. An analysis informed by a conceptual hierarchical model shed light on the pathways that lead from socio-demographic determinants to pregnancy intention. This information can be used to target family planning services to those most at risk of unplanned pregnancies, particularly women with a history of depression or who are experiencing intimate partner violence."
https://openalex.org/W2547021782,"Objectives To assess the value of single and serial fetal biometry for the prediction of small- (SGA) and large-for-gestational-age (LGA) neonates delivered preterm or at term. Methods A cohort study of 3,971 women with singleton pregnancies was conducted from the first trimester until delivery with 3,440 pregnancies (17,334 scans) meeting the following inclusion criteria: 1) delivery of a live neonate after 33 gestational weeks and 2) two or more ultrasound examinations with fetal biometry parameters obtained at ≤36 weeks. Primary outcomes were SGA (<5th centile) and LGA (>95th centile) at birth based on INTERGROWTH-21st gender-specific standards. Fetus-specific estimated fetal weight (EFW) trajectories were calculated by linear mixed-effects models using data up to a fixed gestational age (GA) cutoff (28, 32, or 36 weeks) for fetuses having two or more measurements before the GA cutoff and not already delivered. A screen test positive for single biometry was based on Z-scores of EFW at the last scan before each GA cut-off so that the false positive rate (FPR) was 10%. Similarly, a screen test positive for the longitudinal analysis was based on the projected (extrapolated) EFW at 40 weeks from all available measurements before each cutoff for each fetus. Results Fetal abdominal and head circumference measurements, as well as birth weights in the Detroit population, matched well to the INTERGROWTH-21st standards, yet this was not the case for biparietal diameter (BPD) and femur length (FL) (up to 9% and 10% discrepancy for mean and confidence intervals, respectively), mainly due to differences in the measurement technique. Single biometry based on EFW at the last scan at ≤32 weeks (GA IQR: 27.4–30.9 weeks) had a sensitivity of 50% and 53% (FPR = 10%) to detect preterm and term SGA and LGA neonates, respectively (AUC of 82% both). For the detection of LGA using data up to 32- and 36-week cutoffs, single biometry analysis had higher sensitivity than longitudinal analysis (52% vs 46% and 62% vs 52%, respectively; both p<0.05). Restricting the analysis to subjects with the last observation taken within two weeks from the cutoff, the sensitivity for detection of LGA, but not SGA, increased to 65% and 72% for single biometry at the 32- and 36-week cutoffs, respectively. SGA screening performance was higher for preterm (<37 weeks) than for term cases (73% vs 46% sensitivity; p<0.05) for single biometry at ≤32 weeks. Conclusions When growth abnormalities are defined based on birth weight, growth velocity (captured in the longitudinal analysis) does not provide additional information when compared to the last measurement for predicting SGA and LGA neonates, with both approaches detecting one-half of the neonates (FPR = 10%) from data collected at ≤32 weeks. Unlike for SGA, LGA detection can be improved if ultrasound scans are scheduled as close as possible to the gestational-age cutoff when a decision regarding the clinical management of the patient needs to be made. Screening performance for SGA is higher for neonates that will be delivered preterm."
https://openalex.org/W2547983606,"Water and nitrogen supply are the two primary factors limiting productivity of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). In our study, two winter wheat varieties, Xinong 979 and large-spike wheat, were evaluated for their physiological responses to different levels of nitrogen and water status during their seedling stage grown in a phytotron. Our results indicated that drought stress greatly reduced the net photosynthetic rate (Pn), transpiration rate (E), and stomatal conductance (Gs), but with a greater increase in instantaneous water use efficiency (WUE). At the meantime, the nitrogen (N) supply improved photosynthetic efficiency under water deficit. Parameters inferred from chlorophyll a measurements, i.e., photochemical quenching coefficient (qP), the maximum photochemical efficiency (Fv/Fm), the quantum yield of photosystemII(ΦPSII), and the apparent photosynthetic electron transport rate (ETR) decreased under water stress at all nitrogen levels and declined in N-deficient plants. The root-shoot ratio (R/S) increased slightly with water stress at a low N level; the smallest root-shoot ratio was found at a high N level and moderate drought stress treatment. These results suggest that an appropriate nitrogen supply may be necessary to enhance drought resistance in wheat by improving photosynthetic efficiency and relieving photoinhibition under drought stress. However, an excessive N supply had no effect on drought resistance, which even showed an adverse effect on plant growth. Comparing the two cultivars, Xinong 979 has a stronger drought resistance compared with large-spike wheat under N deficiency."
https://openalex.org/W2547458779,"This study aimed to evaluate bacterial and host factors causing a fever in cows with metritis. For that, we investigated uterine microbiota using a metagenomic sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene (Study 1), and immune response parameters (Study 2) in metritic cows with and without a fever.Bacterial communities were similar between the MNoFever and MFever groups based on distance metrics of relative abundance of bacteria. Metritic cows showed a greater prevalence of Bacteroidetes, and Bacteroides and Porphyromonas were the largest contributors to that difference. A comparison of relative abundance at the species level pointed to Bacteroides pyogenes as a fever-related species which was significantly abundant in the MFever than the MNoFever and Healthy groups; however, absolute abundance of Bacteroides pyogenes determined by droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) was similar between MFever and MNoFever groups, but higher than the Healthy group. The same trend was observed in the total number of bacteria.The activity of polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) and the production of TNFα, PGE2 metabolite, and PGE2 were evaluated in serum, before disease onset, at 0 and 3 DPP. Cows in the MNoFever had decreased proportion of PMN undergoing phagocytosis and oxidative burst compared with the MFever. The low PMN activity in the MNoFever was coupled with the low production of TNFα, but similar PGE2 metabolite and circulating PGE2.Our study is the first to show a similar microbiome between metritic cows with and without a fever, which indicates that the host response may be more important for fever development than the microbiome. Bacteroides pyogenes was identified as an important pathogen for the development of metritis but not fever. The decreased inflammatory response may explain the lack of a febrile response in the MNoFever group."
https://openalex.org/W2514369072,"Evidence is growing that forms of incivility–e.g. aggressive and disrespectful behaviors, harassment, hate speech and outrageous claims–are spreading in the population of social networking sites’ (SNS) users. Online social networks such as Facebook allow users to regularly interact with known and unknown others, who can behave either politely or rudely. This leads individuals not only to learn and adopt successful strategies for using the site, but also to condition their own behavior on that of others. Using a mean field approach, we define anevolutionary game framework to analyse the dynamics of civil and uncivil ways of interaction in online social networks and their consequences for collective welfare. Agents can choose to interact with others–politely or rudely–in SNS, or to opt out from online social networks to protect themselves from incivility. We find that, when the initial share of the population of polite users reaches a critical level, civility becomes generalized if its payoff increases more than that of incivility with the spreading of politeness in online interactions. Otherwise, the spreading of self-protective behaviors to cope with online incivility can lead the economyto non-socially optimal stationary states. JEL Codes: C61, C73, D85, O33, Z13.

Understanding gender differences in sustained attentional control, and their potential sources, is an important goal of psychology and neuroscience and of great relevance to society. We used a large web-based sample (n = 21,484, from testmybrain.org) to examine gender differences in sustained attentional control. Our sample included participants from 41 countries, allowing us to examine how gender differences in each country relate to national indices of gender equality. We found significant gender differences in certain aspects of sustained attentional control. Using indices of gender equality, we found that overall sustained attentional control performance was lower in countries with less equality and that there were greater gender differences in performance in countries with less equality. These findings suggest that creating sociocultural conditions which value women and men equally can improve a component of sustained attention and reduce gender disparities in cognition."
https://openalex.org/W2546514473,"Background Neuroendocrine lung cancer (NELC) represents 25% of all lung cancer cases and large patient collectives exist as formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue only. FFPE is controversially discussed as source for molecular biological analyses and reference genes for NELC are poorly establishes. Material and methods Forty-three representative FFPE-specimens were used for mRNA expression analysis using the digital nCounter technology (NanoString). Based on recent literature, a total of 91 mRNA targets were investigated as potential tumor markers or reference genes. The geNorm, NormFinder algorithms and coefficient of correlation were used to identify the most stable reference genes. Statistical analysis was performed by using the R programming environment (version 3.1.1) Results RNA integrity (RIN) ranged from 1.8 to 2.6 and concentrations from 34 to 2,109 ng/μl. However, the nCounter technology gave evaluable results for all samples tested. ACTB, CDKN1B, GAPDH, GRB2, RHOA and SDCBP were identified as constantly expressed genes with high stability (M-)values according to geNorm, NormFinder and coefficients of correlation. Conclusion FFPE-derived mRNA is suitable for molecular biological investigations via the nCounter technology, although it is highly degraded. ACTB, CDKN1B, GAPDH, GRB2, RHOA and SDCBP are potent reference genes in neuroendocrine tumors of the lung."
https://openalex.org/W2546864466,"Water soluble carbohydrates (WSC) in stems play an important role in buffering grain yield in wheat against biotic and abiotic stresses; however, knowledge of genes controlling WSC is very limited. We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) using a high-density 90K SNP array to better understand the genetic basis underlying WSC, and to explore marker-based breeding approaches. WSC was evaluated in an association panel comprising 166 Chinese bread wheat cultivars planted in four environments. Fifty two marker-trait associations (MTAs) distributed across 23 loci were identified for phenotypic best linear unbiased estimates (BLUEs), and 11 MTAs were identified in two or more environments. Liner regression showed a clear dependence of WSC BLUE scores on numbers of favorable (increasing WSC content) and unfavorable alleles (decreasing WSC), indicating that genotypes with higher numbers of favorable or lower numbers of unfavorable alleles had higher WSC content. In silico analysis of flanking sequences of trait-associated SNPs revealed eight candidate genes related to WSC content grouped into two categories based on the type of encoding proteins, namely, defense response proteins and proteins triggered by environmental stresses. The identified SNPs and candidate genes related to WSC provide opportunities for breeding higher WSC wheat cultivars."
https://openalex.org/W2547835471,"Environmental stewardship requires timely, accurate information related to the status of a given ecosystem and the species that occupy it. Recent advances in the application of the highly sensitive real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) towards identification of constituents within environmental DNA (eDNA) now allow targeted detection of the presence of species-specific biological material within a localized geographic region. However, as with all molecular techniques predicated on the specificity and sensitivity of the PCR assay, careful validation of each eDNA qPCR assay in development must be performed both under controlled laboratory conditions and when challenged with field-derived eDNA samples. Such a step-wise approach forms the basis for incorporation of innovative qPCR design features that strengthen the implementation and interpretation of the eDNA assay. This includes empirical determination that the qPCR assay is refractory to the presence of human DNA and the use of a tripartite assay approach comprised of 1) a primer set targeting plant chloroplast that evaluates the presence of amplifiable DNA from field samples to increase confidence in a negative result, 2) an animal group primer set to increase confidence in the assay result, and 3) a species-specific primer set to assess presence of DNA from the target species. To demonstrate this methodology, we generated eDNA assays specific for the North American bullfrog (Lithobates (Rana) catesbeiana) and the Rocky Mountain tailed frog (Ascaphus montanus) and characterized each with respect to detection sensitivity and specificity with demonstrated performance in a field survey scenario. The qPCR design features presented herein address specific challenges of eDNA assays thereby increasing their interpretative power."
https://openalex.org/W2543455446,"The phagocyte NADPH oxidase 2 (Nox2) is an enzymatic complex that is involved in innate immunity, notably via its capacity to produce toxic reactive oxygen species. Recently, a proteomic analysis of the constitutively active Nox2 complex, isolated from neutrophil fractions, highlighted the presence of 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase (PFK-2). The purpose of this work was to study the relationship between PFK-2 and NADPH oxidase in neutrophils. Data have underlined a specific association of the active phosphorylated form of PFK-2 with Nox2 complex in stimulated neutrophils. In its active form, PFK-2 catalyzes the production of fructose-2,6-bisphosphate, which is the main allosteric activator of phosphofructo-1-kinase, the limiting enzyme in glycolysis. Pharmacologic inhibition of PFK-2 phosphorylation and cell depletion in PFK-2 by a small interfering RNA strategy led to a decrease in the glycolysis rate and a reduction in NADPH oxidase activity in stimulated cells. Surprisingly, alteration of Nox2 activity impacted the glycolysis rate, which indicated that Nox2 in neutrophils was not only required for reactive oxygen species production but was also involved in supporting the energetic metabolism increase that was induced by inflammatory conditions. PFK-2 seems to be a strategic element that links NADPH oxidase activation and glycolysis modulation, and, as such, is proposed as a potential therapeutic target in inflammatory diseases.-Baillet, A., Hograindleur, M.-A., El Benna, J., Grichine, A., Berthier, S., Morel, F., Paclet, M.-H.

https://openalex.org/W2547261419,"This study was conceived to detect skin mites in social mammals through real-time qPCR, and to estimate taxonomic Demodex and further Prostigmata mite relationships in different host species by comparing sequences from two genes: mitochondrial 16S rRNA and nuclear 18S rRNA. We determined the mite prevalence in the hair follicles of marmots (13%) and bats (17%). The high prevalence found in marmots and bats by sampling only one site on the body may indicate that mites are common inhabitants of their skin. Since we found three different mites (Neuchelacheles sp, Myobia sp and Penthaleus sp) in three bat species (Miotis yumanensis, Miotis californicus and Corynorhinus townsendii) and two different mites (both inferred to be members of the Prostigmata order) in one marmot species (Marmota flaviventris), we tentatively concluded that these skin mites 1) cannot be assigned to the same genus based only on a common host, and 2) seem to evolve according to the specific habitat and/or specific hair and sebaceous gland of the mammalian host. Moreover, two M. yumanensis bats harbored identical Neuchelacheles mites, indicating the possibility of interspecific cross-infection within a colony. However, some skin mites species are less restricted by host species than previously thought. Specifically, Demodex canis seems to be more transmissible across species than other skin mites. D. canis have been found mostly in dogs but also in cats and captive bats. In addition, we report the first case of D. canis infestation in a domestic ferret (Mustela putorius). All these mammalian hosts are related to human activities, and D. canis evolution may be a consequence of this relationship. The monophyletic Demodex clade showing closely related dog and human Demodex sequences also supports this likely hypothesis."
https://openalex.org/W2547701495,"We explored how experimentally induced psychological stress affects the production and recognition of vocal emotions. In Study 1a, we demonstrate that sentences spoken by stressed speakers are judged by naïve listeners as sounding more stressed than sentences uttered by non-stressed speakers. In Study 1b, negative emotions produced by stressed speakers are generally less well recognized than the same emotions produced by non-stressed speakers. Multiple mediation analyses suggest this poorer recognition of negative stimuli was due to a mismatch between the variation of volume voiced by speakers and the range of volume expected by listeners. Together, this suggests that the stress level of the speaker affects judgments made by the receiver. In Study 2, we demonstrate that participants who were induced with a feeling of stress before carrying out an emotional prosody recognition task performed worse than non-stressed participants. Overall, findings suggest detrimental effects of induced stress on interpersonal sensitivity."
https://openalex.org/W2542461291,"Antigen-stimulated T cells require elevated importation of essential and non-essential amino acids to generate large numbers of daughter cells necessary for effective immunity to pathogens. When amino acids are limiting, T cells arrest in the G1 phase of the cell cycle, suggesting that they have specific sensing mechanisms to ensure sufficient amino acids are available for multiple rounds of daughter generation. We found that activation of mTORC1, which is regulated by amino acid amounts, was uncoupled from limiting amino acids in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. Instead, we found that Rictor/mTORC2 has an essential role in T cell amino acid sensing. In the absence of Rictor, CD4+ T cells proliferate normally in limiting arginine or leucine. Our data suggest that Rictor/mTORC2 controls an amino acid-sensitive checkpoint that allows T cells to determine whether the microenvironment contains sufficient resources for daughter cell generation."
https://openalex.org/W2546316959,"Accessory cholera enterotoxin (Ace) of Vibrio cholerae has been shown to contribute to diarrhea. However, the signaling mechanism and specific type of Cl− channel activated by Ace are still unknown. We have shown here that the recombinant Ace protein induced ICl of apical plasma membrane, which was inhibited by classical CaCC blockers. Surprisingly, an Ace-elicited rise of current was neither affected by ANO1 (TMEM16A)-specific inhibitor T16A(inh)-AO1(TAO1) nor by the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) blocker, CFTR inh-172. Ace stimulated whole-cell current in Caco-2 cells. However, the apical ICl was attenuated by knockdown of ANO6 (TMEM16F). This impaired phenotype was restored by re-expression of ANO6 in Caco-2 cells. Whole-cell patch clamp recordings of ANO currents in HEK293 cells transiently expressing mouse ANO1-mCherry or ANO6-GFP confirmed that Ace induced Cl− secretion. Application of Ace produced ANO6 but not the ANO1 currents. Ace was not able to induce a [Ca2+]i rise in Caco-2 cells, but cellular abundance of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) increased. Identification of the PIP2-binding motif at the N-terminal sequence among human and mouse ANO6 variants along with binding of PIP2 directly to ANO6 in HEK293 cells indicate likely PIP2 regulation of ANO6. The biophysical and pharmacological properties of Ace stimulated Cl− current along with intestinal fluid accumulation, and binding of PIP2 to the proximal KR motif of channel proteins, whose mutagenesis correlates with altered binding of PIP2, is comparable with ANO6 stimulation. We conclude that ANO6 is predominantly expressed in intestinal epithelia, where it contributes secretory diarrhea by Ace stimulation in a calcium-independent mechanism of RhoA-ROCK-PIP2 signaling. Accessory cholera enterotoxin (Ace) of Vibrio cholerae has been shown to contribute to diarrhea. However, the signaling mechanism and specific type of Cl− channel activated by Ace are still unknown. We have shown here that the recombinant Ace protein induced ICl of apical plasma membrane, which was inhibited by classical CaCC blockers. Surprisingly, an Ace-elicited rise of current was neither affected by ANO1 (TMEM16A)-specific inhibitor T16A(inh)-AO1(TAO1) nor by the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) blocker, CFTR inh-172. Ace stimulated whole-cell current in Caco-2 cells. However, the apical ICl was attenuated by knockdown of ANO6 (TMEM16F). This impaired phenotype was restored by re-expression of ANO6 in Caco-2 cells.

https://openalex.org/W2541282779,"The persistence of HIV in resting memory CD4+ T cells at a latent state is considered as the major barrier on the path to achieve a cure for HIV. Proteasome inhibitors (PIs) were previously reported as latency reversing agents (LRAs) but the mechanism underlying this function is yet unclear. Here we demonstrate that PIs reactivate latent HIV ex vivo without global T cell activation, and may facilitate host innate immune responses. Mechanistically, latent HIV reactivation induced by PIs is mediated by heat shock factor 1 (HSF1) via the recruitment of the heat shock protein (HSP) 90-positive transcriptional elongation factor b (p-TEFb) complex. Specifically, HSP90 downstream HSF1 gives positive feedback to the reactivation process through binding to cyclin-dependent kinase 9 (CDK9) and preventing it from undergoing degradation by the proteasome. Overall, these findings suggest proteasome inhibitors as potential latency reversing agents. In addition, HSF1/HSP90 involved in HIV transcription elongation, may serve as therapeutic targets in HIV eradication."
https://openalex.org/W2542995627,"In this exploratory study we examined the associations between several social network characteristics and lifestyle behaviours in adults at increased risk of diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. In addition, we explored whether similarities in lifestyle between individuals and their network members, or the level of social support perceived by these individuals, could explain these associations.From the control group of the Hoorn Prevention Study, participants with high and low educational attainment were approached for a structured interview between April and August 2010. Inclusion was stopped when fifty adults agreed to participate. Participants and a selection of their network members (e.g. spouses, best friends, neighbours, colleagues) completed a questionnaire on healthy lifestyle that included questions on fruit and vegetable intake, daily physical activity and leisure-time sedentary behaviour. We first examined associations between network characteristics and lifestyle using regression analyses. Second, we assessed associations between network characteristics and social support, social support and lifestyle, and compared the participants' lifestyles to those of their network members using concordance correlation coefficients.Fifty adults (50/83 x 100 = 62% response) and 170 of their network members (170/192 x 100 = 89% response) participated in the study. Individuals with more close-knit relationships, more friends who live nearby, and a larger and denser network showed higher levels of vegetable consumption and physical activity, and lower levels of sedentary behaviour. Perceived social norms or perceived support for behavioural change were not related to healthy lifestyle. Except for spousal concordance for vegetable intake, the lifestyle of individuals and their network members were not alike.Study results suggest that adults with a larger and denser social network have a healthier lifestyle. Underlying mechanisms for these associations should be further explored, as the current results suggest a minimal role for social support and modelling by network members."
https://openalex.org/W2547590599,"Rapidly Mutating Y-STRs (RM Y-STRs) were recently introduced in forensics in order to increase the differentiation of Y-chromosomal profiles even in case of close relatives. We estimate RM Y-STRs mutation rates and their power to discriminate between related individuals by using samples extracted from a wide set of paternal pedigrees and by comparing RM Y-STRs results with those obtained from the Y-filer set. In addition, we tested the ability of RM Y-STRs to discriminate between unrelated individuals carrying the same Y-filer haplotype, using the haplogroup R-M269 (reportedly characterised by a strong resemblance in Y-STR profiles) as a case study. Our results, despite confirming the high mutability of RM Y-STRs, show significantly lower mutation rates than reference germline ones. Consequently, their power to discriminate between related individuals, despite being higher than the one of Y-filer, does not seem to improve significantly the performance of the latter. On the contrary, when considering R-M269 unrelated individuals, RM Y-STRs reveal significant discriminatory power and retain some phylogenetic signal, allowing the correct classification of individuals for some R-M269-derived sub-lineages. These results have important implications not only for forensics, but also for molecular anthropology, suggesting that RM Y-STRs are useful tools for exploring subtle genetic variability within Y-chromosomal haplogroups."
https://openalex.org/W2547286747,"Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide in children aged <5 years and older adults with acute lower respiratory infections (ALRIs). However, few studies regarding the epidemiology of hospitalizations for RSV infection have been performed previously in China. Here, we aimed to describe the clinical and epidemiologic characteristics of hospitalized patients with laboratory-confirmed RSV infection in eastern China. Active surveillance for hospitalized ALRI patients using a broad case definition based on symptoms was performed from 2009-2013 in 12 sentinel hospitals in eastern China. Clinical and epidemiologic data pertaining to hospitalized patients of all ages with laboratory-confirmed RSV infection by PCR assay were collected and analyzed in this study. From 2009 to 2013, 1046 hospitalized patients with laboratory-confirmed RSV infection were enrolled in this study, and 14.7% of patients had subtype A, 24.2% of patients had subtype B, 23.8% of patients with subtype not performed, and 37.3% of patients had RSV coinfections with other viruses. RSV and influenza coinfections (33.3%) were the most common coinfections noted in this study. Moreover, young children aged <5 years (89.1%, 932/1046), particularly young infants aged <1 year (43.3%, 453/1046), represented the highest proportion of patients with RSV infections. In contrast, older adults aged ≥60 years (1.1%, 12/1046) represented the lowest proportion of patients with RSV infections among enrolled patients. The peak RSV infection period occurred mainly during autumn and winter, and 57% and 66% of patients exhibited symptoms such as fever (body temperature ≥38°C) and cough separately. Additionally, only a small number of patients were treated with broad-spectrum antiviral drugs, and most of patients were treated with antimicrobial drugs that were not appropriate for RSV infection. RSV is a leading viral pathogen and a common cause of viral infection in young children aged <5 years with ALRIs in eastern China. Effective vaccines and antiviral agents targeting RSV are needed to mitigate its large public health impact."
https://openalex.org/W2547470394,"Altered levels of naturally occurring autoantibodies (nAbs) against disease-associated neuronal proteins have been reported for neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). Recent histopathologic studies suggest a contribution of both Lewy body- and AD-related pathology to Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD). Therefore, we explored nAbs against alpha-synuclein (αS), tau and β-amyloid (Aβ) in PDD compared to cognitively normal PD patients.We established three different ELISAs to quantify the nAbs-tau, nAbs-αS, and nAbs-Aβ levels and avidity towards their specific antigen in serum samples of 18 non-demented (PDND) and 18 demented PD patients (PDD), which were taken from an ongoing multi-center cohort study (DEMPARK/LANDSCAPE).PDD patients had significantly decreased nAbs-tau serum levels compared to PDND patients (p = 0.007), whereas the serum titers of nAbs-αS and nAbs-Aβ were unchanged. For all three nAbs, no significant differences in avidity were found between PDD and PDND cohorts. However, within both patient groups, nAbs-tau showed lowest avidity to their antigen, followed by nAbs-αS, and nAbs-Aβ. Though, due to a high interassay coefficient of variability and the exclusion of many samples below the limit of detection, conclusions for nAbs-Aβ are only conditionally possible.We detected a significantly decreased nAbs-tau serum level in PDD patients, indicating a potential linkage between nAbs-tau serum titer and cognitive deficits in PD. Thus, further investigation in larger samples is justified to confirm our findings."

Newly-diagnosed GC cases (n = 454) and control patients (n = 628) were matched by age (+/- 5 years) and the year of hospitalization. Information on smoking and alcohol drinking habits and diet including salty food intake and fruits/vegetables consumption were obtained by the interview. Maximum likelihood estimates of odds ratios (ORs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (Cis) were obtained using conditional logistic regression models.The group with the highest consumption of citrus fruits showed a significantly low GC risk (OR = 0.6, 95%CI = 0.4-0.8, P for trend = 0.002). However, there was no association of raw vegetable consumption with GC risk. Referring to never smokers, GC risk was significantly higher in current WPT smokers (OR = 1.8, 95%CI = 1.3-2.4), and it was more evident in exclusively WPT smokers (OR = 2.7, 95%CI = 1.2-6.5). GC risk tended to be higher with daily frequency and longer duration of WPT smoking but these trends were not statistically significant (P for trend: 0.144 and 0.154, respectively). GC risk of those who started smoking WPT before the age of 25 was also significantly high (OR = 3.7, 95%CI = 1.2-11.3). Neither cigarette smoking nor alcohol drinking was related to GC risk.The present findings revealed that WPT smoking was positively associated with GC risk in Vietnamese men."
https://openalex.org/W2547137890,"Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) migrate to damaged tissues, where they participate in tissue repair. Human fetal MSCs (hfMSCs), compared with adult MSCs, have higher proliferation rates, a greater differentiation capacity and longer telomeres with reduced senescence. Therefore, transplantation of quality controlled hfMSCs is a promising therapeutic intervention. Previous studies have shown that intravenous or intracortical injections of MSCs result in the emergence of binucleated cerebellar Purkinje cells (PCs) containing an MSC-derived marker protein in mice, thus suggesting a fusion event. However, transdifferentiation of MSCs into PCs or transfer of a marker protein from an MSC to a PC cannot be ruled out. In this study, we unequivocally demonstrated the fusion of hfMSCs with murine PCs through a tetracycline-regulated (Tet-off) system with or without a Cre-dependent genetic inversion switch (flip-excision; FLEx). In the FLEx-Tet system, we performed intra-cerebellar injection of viral vectors expressing tetracycline transactivator (tTA) and Cre recombinase into either non-symptomatic (4-week-old) or clearly symptomatic (6-8-month-old) spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) mice. Then, the mice received an injection of 50,000 genetically engineered hfMSCs that expressed GFP only in the presence of Cre recombinase and tTA. We observed a significant emergence of GFP-expressing PCs and interneurons in symptomatic, but not non-symptomatic, SCA1 mice 2 weeks after the MSC injection. These results, together with the results obtained using age-matched wild-type mice, led us to conclude that hfMSCs have the potential to preferentially fuse with degenerating PCs and interneurons but not with healthy neurons."
https://openalex.org/W2547703411,"Cell division and cell wall synthesis mechanisms are similarly conserved among bacteria. Consequently some bacterial species have comparable sets of genes organized in the dcw (division and cell wall) gene cluster. Dcw genes, their regulation and their relative order within the cluster are outstandingly conserved among rod shaped and gram negative bacteria to ensure an efficient coordination of growth and division. A well studied representative is the dcw gene cluster of E. coli. The first promoter of the gene cluster (mraZ1p) gives rise to polycistronic transcripts containing a 38 nt long 5' UTR followed by the first gene mraZ. Despite reported conservation we present evidence for a much longer 5' UTR in the gram negative and rod shaped bacterium Rhodobacter sphaeroides and in the family of Rhodobacteraceae. This extended 268 nt long 5' UTR comprises a Rho independent terminator, which in case of termination gives rise to a non-coding RNA (UpsM). This sRNA is conditionally cleaved by RNase E under stress conditions in an Hfq- and very likely target mRNA-dependent manner, implying its function in trans. These results raise the question for the regulatory function of this extended 5' UTR. It might represent the rarely described case of a trans acting sRNA derived from a riboswitch with exclusive presence in the family of Rhodobacteraceae."

Most proteins that interact with collagen bind only to the native triple-helical form, whereas Fn is unusual in binding strongly to denatured collagen and more weakly to native collagen. The consequences of replacing a Gly by Ser at each position in the required (Gly-Xaa-Yaa)6 Fn-binding sequence are probed here, using model peptides and a recombinant bacterial collagen system. Fluorescence polarization and solid-state assays indicated that Gly replacements at four sites within the Fn-binding sequence led to decreased Fn binding to denatured collagen. Molecular dynamics simulations showed these Gly replacements interfered with the interaction of a collagen β-strand with the β-sheet structure of Fn modules seen in the high resolution crystal structure. Whereas previous studies showed that Gly to Ser mutations within an integrin-binding site caused no major structural perturbations, mutations within the Fn-binding site caused the triple helix to become highly sensitive to trypsin digestion. This trypsin susceptibility is consistent with the significant local unfolding and loss of hydrogen bonding seen in molecular dynamics simulations. Protease sensitivity resulting from mutations in the Fn-binding sequence could lead to degradation of type I collagen, early embryonic lethality, and the scarcity of reported osteogenesis imperfecta mutations in this region.

https://openalex.org/W2547479962,"Background Carboxyl-ester lipase (CEL) contributes to fatty acid ethyl ester metabolism, which is implicated in alcoholic pancreatitis. The CEL gene harbours a variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR) region in exon 11. Variation in this VNTR has been linked to monogenic pancreatic disease, while conflicting results were reported for chronic pancreatitis (CP). Here, we aimed to investigate a potential association of CEL VNTR lengths with alcoholic CP. Methods Overall, 395 alcoholic CP patients, 218 patients with alcoholic liver cirrhosis (ALC) serving as controls with a comparable amount of alcohol consumed, and 327 healthy controls from Germany and the United Kingdom (UK) were analysed by determination of fragment lengths by capillary electrophoresis. Allele frequencies and genotypes of different VNTR categories were compared between the groups. Results Twelve repeats were overrepresented in UK ACP patients (P = 0.04) compared to controls, whereas twelve repeats were enriched in German ALC compared to alcoholic CP patients (P = 0.03). Frequencies of CEL VNTR lengths of 14 and 15 repeats differed between German ALC patients and healthy controls (P = 0.03 and 0.008, respectively). However, in the genotype and pooled analysis of VNTR lengths no statistical significant association was depicted. Additionally, the 16–16 genotype as well as 16 repeats were more frequent in UK ALC than in alcoholic CP patients (P = 0.034 and 0.02, respectively). In all other calculations, including pooled German and UK data, allele frequencies and genotype distributions did not differ significantly between patients and controls or between alcoholic CP and ALC. Conclusions We did not obtain evidence that CEL VNTR lengths are associated with alcoholic CP. However, our results suggest that CEL VNTR lengths might associate with ALC, a finding that needs to be clarified in larger cohorts."
https://openalex.org/W2548309896,"Introduction Anesthesia induces insulin resistance, which may contribute to elevated blood glucose and adverse post-operative outcomes in critically ill patients, and impair glycemic control in surgical patients with diabetes. However, little is known about the mechanisms by which anesthesia impairs insulin sensitivity. Here we investigate the effects of anesthesia on insulin sensitivity in metabolic tissues. Methods Hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps were performed in 32 lean (control diet; n = 16 conscious versus n = 16 anesthetized) and 24 fat-fed (6 weeks fat-feeding; n = 16 conscious versus n = 8 anesthetized) adult male mongrel dogs in conjunction with tracer methodology to differentiate hepatic versus peripheral insulin sensitivity. Propofol was administered as an intravenous bolus (3mg/kg) to initiate anesthesia, which was then maintained with inhaled sevoflurane or isoflurane (2–3%) for the duration of the procedure. Results Anesthesia reduced peripheral insulin sensitivity by approximately 50% in both lean and fat-fed animals as compared to conscious animals, and insulin action at the liver was almost completely suppressed during anesthesia such that hepatic insulin sensitivity was decreased by 75.5% and; 116.2% in lean and fat-fed groups, respectively. Conclusion Inhaled anesthesia induces severe hepatic insulin resistance in a canine model. Countermeasures that preserve hepatic insulin sensitivity may represent a therapeutic target that could improve surgical outcomes in both diabetic and healthy patients."

Furthermore, short hairpin-mediated knockdown of Dcx in cultured rat neurons led to reduction of dendrite complexity (15.Cohen D. Segal M. Reiner O.

These knock-out phenotypes are attributed to the required regulation of MTs by Dcx. The converse is also true; overexpression of Dcx increases dendrite complexity (15.Cohen D. Segal M. Reiner O. Doublecortin supports the development of dendritic arbors in primary hippocampal neurons.Dev. Neurosci. 2008; 30: 187-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), further supporting a role for Dcx in modulating dendrite elaboration. Similarly, overexpression of Dclk1 increases dendrite complexity (20.Shin E. Kashiwagi Y. Kuriu T. Iwasaki H. Tanaka T. Koizumi H. Gleeson J.G. Okabe S. Doublecortin-like kinase enhances dendritic remodelling and negatively regulates synapse maturation.Nat. Commun. 2013; 4: 1440Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Dcx is also found in complexes with other proteins, including the actin-associated protein spinophilin (spn) (21.Tsukada M. Prokscha A. Oldekamp J. Eichele G.

Dev. 2003; 120: 1033-1043Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), the clathrin adaptors AP-1 and AP-2 (22.Friocourt G. Chafey P. Billuart P. Koulakoff A. Vinet M.C. Schaar B.T. McConnell S.K.

Neurosci. 2002; 22: 7948-7958Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting additional roles for Dcx. These interactions were mapped to regions C-terminal to the MT-binding sites (Fig. 1A). In fact, we previously discovered that Dcx promotes the endocytosis of neurofascin independent of MT binding (24.Yap C.C. Vakulenko M. Kruczek K. Motamedi B. Digilio L. Liu J.S. Winckler B. Doublecortin (DCX) mediates endocytosis of neurofascin independently of microtubule binding.J.

Winckler., manuscript in preparation. Among the known DCX patient alleles, some have mutations in the N-terminal MT-binding domain and lack MT binding, whereas others have truncated C termini and thus retain MT binding (Fig. 1A). It is not known whether both classes of DCX patient alleles impair dendrite growth equally. The available knock-out mouse model for Dcx presents considerable challenges in terms of molecular characterization of DCX alleles. In particular, the phenotypes reported for Dcx KO mice are very subtle and often transient, presumably because of redundancy with Dclk1 and Dclk2 (8.Deuel T.A. Liu J.S. Corbo J.C. Yoo S.-Y.

Neurosci. 2013; 33: 709-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), making them a challenging and expensive model for carrying out Dcx mutant analysis. For these technical reasons, very little analysis is currently available about how DCX patient mutants behave in neurons. To circumvent these technical barriers, we decided to take advantage experimentally of the observation that Dcx can enhance dendrite growth when overexpressed (15.Cohen D. Segal M. Reiner O. Doublecortin supports the development of dendritic arbors in primary hippocampal neurons.Dev. Neurosci. 2008; 30: 187-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). We thus used dendrite enhancement by Dcx expression as an assay for wild type Dcx function, using previously described MT binding-competent and MT binding-deficient mutants (25.Kim M.H. Cierpicki T.

Berkovic S. et al.Characterization of mutations in the gene doublecortin in patients with double cortex syndrome.Ann. Neurol. 1999; 45: 146-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). We found that Dcx alleles that retain MT binding but lack the C-terminal regions (required for spn and AP adaptor binding) are defective for dendrite growth promotion (i.e. loss-of-function alleles) but to differing degrees. In particular, truncation mutants that retained MT and spn binding and lacked only the extreme C termini were less impaired than shorter truncation mutants that retained only MT binding. In addition, we found, surprisingly, that one of the mutations caused a cellular stress response in neurons through aggregate formation. These aggregates were ubiquitinated and were included in autophagosomes. Neurons thus likely up-regulated degradative responses to clear the aggregates. Failure to efficiently clear the aggregates may lead to eventual cellular dysfunction and even death. This allele thus engaged an “off-pathway” response that was not usually activated by Dcx and could be classified as “neomorph” by this criterion. We report here an ex vivo overexpression approach as an experimentally efficient way for a first-pass screening of multiple DCX alleles in neurons. In particular, we dissected the cellular phenotypes of several DCX patient mutations in neurons and discovered that distinct DCX patient alleles caused dysfunction by different cellular mechanisms. This approach resulted in generating new hypotheses. The next step will be to take the insights generated and test their implications in a more physiological in vivo context in the future. In addition, more of the published alleles need to be screened in neuronal cultures to further delineate other possible cellular pathways in which DCX alleles are deficient or in which off-pathway events occur for some alleles. The functions of Dcx have been investigated on multiple levels, from biophysical (using purified proteins) to cellular (mostly in non-neuronal cells) to tissue level (using knock-out models). Taking mechanistic discoveries from an in vitro binding assay straight into the whole animal is, more often than not, impossible or not informative, especially for DCX, a human disease gene for which the KO mouse does not fully phenocopy the human pathology. One reason for this lack of phenocopy is likely the small size of the murine cortex, coupled to redundancy with other genes in the same family. Furthermore, because the DCX gene is on the X-chromosome, it cannot be determined from the inheritance pattern whether or not any given human DCX patient allele is loss-of-function. Therefore, important new insights might be gained by expression analysis of Dcx mutants in cultured neurons as an initial step. We thus decided to initiate an investigation of neuronal effects for a number of Dcx alleles that had previously only been studied in non-neuronal cells or in vitro. We chose to investigate a cellular process that was known to be affected by Dcx in cultured neurons, namely dendrite growth. Because we can read out the activity of WT Dcx with this assay by increased dendrite growth, we can ask which patient alleles are loss-of-function alleles and then correlate their molecular binding activities with their lack of or altered function. WT Dcx was previously shown to increase dendrite complexity in cultured neurons (15.Cohen D. Segal M. Reiner O. Doublecortin supports the development of dendritic arbors in primary hippocampal neurons.Dev. Neurosci. 2008; 30: 187-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Freshly dissociated rat cortical neurons from E18 embryos were electroporated prior to plating with plasmids encoding GFP (as control) or WT Dcx, and the number of dendrites intersecting a concentric circle (diameter of 30 μm) was counted at 5 days in vitro (DIV5) (Fig. 1B). This measurement corresponds to a simplified Scholl analysis because dendrites are still short at these times in culture. In agreement with previous reports, we found that expression of WT Dcx led to a significant increase in dendrite complexity compared with expressing GFP as a control (Fig. 1, C and D). The traced examples shown in Fig. 1C were chosen to represent the 50th percentile of each data set. We next asked whether the C terminus was necessary for Dcx-mediated dendrite complexity using the Dcx truncations Dcx-303X and Dcx-272X (Fig. 1A), which corresponded to published patient alleles. Dcx-272X expression did not increase dendrite complexity, in contrast to expression of WT-Dcx (Fig. 1, C and D). Dcx-303X was still partially active and increased dendrite complexity compared with Dcx-272X, but it was less potent than WT Dcx (Fig. 1, C and D). The Dcx C terminus was thus necessary for promoting dendrite growth. The MT-binding domain of Dcx has been mapped by multiple laboratories and resides in the DC repeat regions of the N terminus of Dcx (see Fig. 1A). A truncated Dcx (DC repeats 1 and 2: Dcx1–247) still bound to microtubules in vitro (27.Taylor K.R. Holzer A.K. Bazan J.F. Walsh C.A. Gleeson J.G. Patient mutations in doublecortin define a repeated tubulin-binding domain.J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34442-34450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), and both Dcx-303X and Dcx-272X contain all of the DC repeats. To confirm in our own hands the ability of the Dcx C-terminal truncations to associate with microtubules inside cells, we used a cell-based detergent extraction assay, previously established by others (26.Sapir T. Horesh D. Caspi M. Atlas R. Burgess H.A. Wolf S.G. Francis F. Chelly J. Elbaum M. Pietrokovski S. Reiner O. Doublecortin mutations cluster in evolutionarily conserved functional domains.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 703-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 27.Taylor K.R. Holzer A.K. Bazan J.F. Walsh C.A. Gleeson J.G. Patient mutations in doublecortin define a repeated tubulin-binding domain.J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34442-34450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). WT Dcx has been established by multiple laboratories (including ours) to remain associated with MTs by this stringent cell-based assay. This assay is thus well suited to determine whether Dcx mutants are still principally able to associate with microtubules in cells (see “Experimental Procedures”). We quantified the ability of the two truncation mutants to remain associated with microtubules in transfected cells as follows: compared with GFP as a negative control and WT Dcx as a positive control. COS cells were transfected with GFP, WT Dcx, Dcx-303X, or Dcx-272X. Lamin-cherry was co-transfected to mark transfected cells after detergent extraction. After 24 h, one coverslip was fixed directly (“unextracted”), and one coverslip was extracted in detergent in microtubule-stabilizing buffer BRB-80 (“extracted”) for each construct. The mean intensity of Dcx in transfected cells was then quantified. For GFP, ∼90% of the GFP signal was extractable (Fig. 2, A, B, and F), whereas WT Dcx intensity was barely diminished by detergent extraction, demonstrating that WT Dcx remained bound to microtubule networks under these extraction conditions (Fig. 2, C and F). Similarly to WT Dcx, Dcx-303X (Fig. 2D) and Dcx-272X (Fig. 2E) were still clearly able to associate with MTs (Fig. 2F), again in agreement with previous observations that the microtubule-binding domain is entirely contained within the DC repeats (26.Sapir T. Horesh D. Caspi M. Atlas R. Burgess H.A. Wolf S.G. Francis F. Chelly J. Elbaum M. Pietrokovski S. Reiner O. Doublecortin mutations cluster in evolutionarily conserved functional domains.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 703-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 27.Taylor K.R. Holzer A.K. Bazan J.F. Walsh C.A. Gleeson J.G. Patient mutations in doublecortin define a repeated tubulin-binding domain.J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34442-34450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Because Dcx-272X was not active in dendrite growth promotion even though it still associated with microtubules, we wondered whether binding to another protein via the more C-terminal domain (missing in the truncated Dcx-272X) might be required for full activity. The actin-binding protein spn had been identified as a binding partner of Dcx, and co-expression with spn reportedly recruited Dcx increasingly onto the F-actin network (21.Tsukada M. Prokscha A. Oldekamp J. Eichele G. Identification of neurabin II as a novel doublecortin interacting protein.Mech. Dev. 2003; 120: 1033-1043Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In our hands, WT-Dcx was also recovered in anti-Myc immunoprecipitations when Myc-spn was co-expressed in COS cells but not in controls lacking Myc-spn (Fig. 3A). When Dcx was expressed in COS cells, it co-localized strikingly with MTs but not with F-actin (phalloidin stain) (Fig. 3B). In contrast, when Dcx was co-expressed with spn in COS cells, Dcx was distributed on both MTs and F-actin (Fig. 3C). The boxed region of these quadruple-stained cells is shown in combinations of three channels in Fig. 3D to make the dual co-localization with distinct MTs (arrowhead) and F-actin (arrows) easier to appreciate. Because MTs and F-actin occupy largely overlapping spaces in COS cells, visualizing Dcx pools on spn-containing F-actin structures was challenging. We thus determined whether Dcx was able to co-localize with spn in neurons where spn was greatly enriched in the actin-rich filopodia off the sides of dendrites and could thus be clearly distinguished from the MT-rich dendritic shaft. When Dcx was expressed with spn, Dcx strongly stained the dendrite shaft, but Dcx staining could also be observed in MT-poor, actin/spn-rich dendritic filopodia (Fig. 3E), suggesting that a subpopulation of Dcx was able to enter actin-rich surface structures. Dcx-272X also entered spn-rich dendritic filopodia (Fig. 3F). We were unable to clearly quantify whether it occurred to a similar extent as WT Dcx because expression levels varied from cell to cell after the transient transfections. We thus turned to a more quantifiable assay to determine the spn binding capacity of Dcx and the Dcx truncations, namely co-immunoprecipitations. The binding site for spn on Dcx had been coarsely mapped previously. One paper reported no spn binding of Dcx-246X (21.Tsukada M. Prokscha A. Oldekamp J. Eichele G. Identification of neurabin II as a novel doublecortin interacting protein.Mech. Dev. 2003; 120: 1033-1043Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and another reported that the second DC repeat (amino acids 170–260) is sufficient for binding (6.Bielas S.L. Serneo F.F.

Optimally the oligomerization requires (i) a temperature of 80°C, (ii) a neutral to alkaline environment and (iii) a time on the order of weeks.

Polymerization of 3’,5’ cyclic nucleotides, whose paramount relevance in a prebiotic chemistry context has been widely accepted for decades, supports the possibility that the origin of extant genetic materials might have followed a direct uninterrupted path since its very beginning, starting from non-elaborately pre-activated monomer compounds and simple reactions."

The nervous system is recognized as one of the key regulators of bone mass, thereby suggesting a role for neuronal pathways in bone homeostasis. However, in the context of bone injury and repair, little is known on the interplay between the nervous system and bone. Here, we addressed the neuropeptide Y (NPY) neuronal arm during the initial stages of bone repair encompassing the inflammatory response and ossification phases in femoral-defect mouse model. Spatial and temporal analysis of transcriptional and protein levels of NPY and its receptors, Y1R and Y2R, reported to be involved in bone homeostasis, was performed in bone, dorsal root ganglia (DRG) and hypothalamus after femoral injury. The results showed that NPY system activity is increased in a time- and space-dependent manner during bone repair. Y1R expression was trigged in both bone and DRG throughout the inflammatory phase, while a Y2R response was restricted to the hypothalamus and at a later stage, during the ossification step. Our results provide new insights into the involvement of NPY neuronal pathways in bone repair."
https://openalex.org/W2546525035,"Purpose This study investigated whether alcoholic intoxication (AI) increases the risk of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) by using a population-based database in Taiwan. Methods This retrospective matched-cohort study included 57 611 inpatients with new-onset AI (AI cohort) and 230 444 randomly selected controls (non-AI cohort). Each patient was monitored for 10 years to individually identify those who were subsequently diagnosed with Crohn disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) during the follow-up period. Cox proportional hazard regression analysis was conducted to determine the risk of IBD in patients with AI compared with controls without AI. Results The incidence rate of IBD during the 10-year follow-up period was 2.69 per 1 000 person-years and 0.49 per 1 000 person-years in the AI and non-AI cohorts, respectively. After adjustment for age, sex, and comorbidity, the AI cohort exhibited a 3.17-fold increased risk of IBD compared with the non-AI cohort (hazard ratio [HR] = 3.17, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.19–4.58). Compared with the non-AI cohort, the HRs of CD and UC were 4.40 and 2.33 for the AI cohort, respectively. After stratification for the severity of AI according to the duration of hospital stay, the adjusted HRs exhibited a significant correlation with the severity; the HRs of IBD were 1.76, 6.83, and 19.9 for patients with mild, moderate, and severe AI, respectively (p for the trend < .0001). Conclusion The risk of IBD was higher in patients with AI and increased with the length of hospital stay."
https://openalex.org/W2546733747,"Objective Multiple sclerosis (MS) develops as a result of environmental influences on the genetically susceptible. Siblings of people with MS have an increased risk of both MS and demonstrating asymptomatic changes in keeping with MS. We set out to develop an MS risk score integrating both genetic and environmental risk factors. We used this score to identify siblings at extremes of MS risk and attempted to validate the score using brain MRI. Methods 78 probands with MS, 121 of their unaffected siblings and 103 healthy controls were studied. Personal history was taken, and serological and genetic analysis using the illumina immunochip was performed. Odds ratios for MS associated with each risk factor were derived from existing literature, and the log values of the odds ratios from each of the risk factors were combined in an additive model to provide an overall score. Scores were initially calculated using log odds ratio from the HLA-DRB1*1501 allele only, secondly using data from all MS-associated SNPs identified in the 2011 GWAS. Subjects with extreme risk scores underwent validation studies. MRI was performed on selected individuals. Results There was a significant difference in the both risk scores between people with MS, their unaffected siblings and healthy controls (p<0.0005). Unaffected siblings had a risk score intermediate to people with MS and controls (p<0.0005). The best performing risk score generated an AUC of 0.82 (95%CI 0.75–0.88). Interpretations The risk score demonstrates an AUC on the threshold for clinical utility. Our score enables the identification of a high-risk sibling group to inform pre-symptomatic longitudinal studies."

While the vestibular system is known to contribute to balance and fall prevention, it is unclear whether it contributes to detecting slip or trip onset. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of slipping and tripping on head acceleration during walking. This information would help determine whether individuals with vestibular dysfunction are likely to be at a greater risk of falls due to slipping or tripping, and would inform the potential development of assistive devices providing augmented sensory feedback for vestibular dysfunction. Twelve young men were exposed to an unexpected slip or trip. Head acceleration was measured and transformed to an approximate location of the vestibular system. Peak linear acceleration in anterior, posterior, rightward, leftward, superior, and inferior directions were compared between slipping, tripping, and walking. Compared to walking, peak accelerations were up to 4.68 m/s2 higher after slipping, and up to 10.64 m/s2 higher after tripping. Head acceleration first deviated from walking 100-150ms after slip onset and 0-50ms after trip onset. The temporal characteristics of head acceleration support a possible contribution of the vestibular system to detecting trip onset, but not slip onset. Head acceleration after slipping and tripping also appeared to be sufficiently large to contribute to the balance recovery response."

Three patients had normally functioning valves, 12 had regurgitation alone, eight had regurgitation and stenosis and one had only stenosis. Patients had bicuspid and tricuspid aortic valves (9/15). Serum samples were taken preoperatively, and the aortic wall specimen collected during surgical aortic repair.Pro-MMP-2 was identified in all serum and tissue samples. Pro-MMP-2 was detected in all tissue and serum samples from patients with ascending aortic/aortic root aneurysms, irrespective of valve morphology or other clinical parameters and in serum from healthy controls. We also identified active MMP-2 in all tissue samples from patients with ascending aortic/aortic root aneurysms. None of the analyzed serum samples revealed signals relatable to active MMP-2. No correlation between aortic tissue total MMP-2 or tissue pro-MMP-2 or tissue active MMP-2 and serum MMP-2 was found and tissue MMP-2/pro-MMP-2/active MMP-2 did not correlate with aortic diameter. This evidence shows that pro-MMP-2 is the predominant MMP-2 species in serum of patients and healthy individuals and in aneurysmatic aortic tissue, irrespective of aortic valve configuration. Active MMP-2 species are either not released into systemic circulation or not detectable in serum. There is no reliable connection between aortic tissue-and serum MMP-2 isoforms, nor any indication that pro-MMP-2 functions as a common marker of high aortic wall stress."

Thus, in this study involving a large Chinese cohort, we developed and validated a risk model for surgery-related AKI using preoperative risk factors.This retrospective cohort study included 24,451 hypertensive patients aged ≥18 years who underwent general surgery between 2007 and 2015. The endpoints for AKI classification utilized by the KDIGO (Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes) system were assessed. The most discriminative predictor was selected using Fisher scores and was subsequently used to construct a stepwise multivariate logistic regression model, whose performance was evaluated via comparisons with models used in other published works using the net reclassification index (NRI) and integrated discrimination improvement (IDI) index.Surgery-related AKI developed in 1994 hospitalized patients (8.2%). The predictors identified by our Xiang-ya Model were age, gender, eGFR, NLR, pulmonary infection, prothrombin time, thrombin time, hemoglobin, uric acid, serum potassium, serum albumin, total cholesterol, and aspartate amino transferase. The area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC) for the validation set and cross validation set were 0.87 (95% CI 0.86-0.89) and (0.89; 95% CI 0.88-0.90), respectively, and was therefore similar to the AUC for the training set (0.89; 95% CI 0.88-0.90). The optimal cutoff value was 0.09. Our model outperformed that developed by Kate et al., which exhibited an NRI of 31.38% (95% CI 25.7%-37.1%) and an IDI of 8% (95% CI 5.52%-10.50%) for patients who underwent cardiac surgery (n = 2101).We developed an AKI risk model based on preoperative risk factors and biomarkers that demonstrated good performance when predicting events in a large cohort of hypertensive patients who underwent general surgery."
https://openalex.org/W2546496989,"Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) genetic predisposition is partially known.This study aimed at assessing the functional impact of nine ADAMTS13 single nucleotide variants (SNVs) previously reported to be associated as a group with DVT in a burden test and the individual association of selected variants with DVT risk in two replication studies.Wild-type and mutant recombinant ADAMTS13 were transiently expressed in HEK293 cells. Antigen and activity of recombinant ADAMTS13 were measured by ELISA and FRETS-VWF73 assays, respectively. The replication studies were performed in an Italian case-control study (Milan study; 298/298 patients/controls) using a next-generation sequencing approach and in a Dutch case-control study (MEGA study; 4306/4887 patients/controls) by TaqMan assays.In vitro results showed reduced ADAMTS13 activity for three SNVs (p.Val154Ile [15%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 14-16], p.Asp187His [19%; 95%[CI] 17-21], p.Arg421Cys [24%; 95%[CI] 22-26]) similar to reduced plasma ADAMTS13 levels of patients carriers for these SNVs. Therefore these three SNVs were interrogated for risk association. The first replication study identified 3 heterozygous carriers (2 cases, 1 control) of p.Arg421Cys (odds ratio [OR] 2, 95%[CI] 0.18-22.25). The second replication study identified 2 heterozygous carriers (1 case, 1 control) of p.Asp187His ([OR] 1.14, 95%[CI] 0.07-18.15) and 10 heterozygous carriers (4 cases, 6 controls) of p.Arg421Cys ([OR] 0.76, 95%[CI] 0.21-2.68).Three SNVs (p.Val154Ile, p.Asp187His and p.Arg421Cys) showed reduced ex vivo and in vitro ADAMTS13 levels. However, the low frequency of these variants makes it difficult to confirm their association with DVT."
https://openalex.org/W2546897762,"The aim of this study was to determine whether transgenic birch (Betula platyphylla) ectopic overexpressing a late embryogenesis abundant (LEA) gene and a basic leucine zipper (bZIP) gene from the salt-tolerant genus Tamarix (salt cedar) show increased tolerance to salt (NaCl) stress. Co-transfer of TaLEA and ThbZIP in birch under the control of two independent CaMV 35S promoters significantly enhanced salt stress. PCR and northern blot analyses indicated that the two genes were ectopically overexpressed in several dual-gene transgenic birch lines. We compared the effects of salt stress among three transgenic birch lines (L-4, L-5, and L-8) and wild type (WT). In all lines, the net photosynthesis values were higher before salt stress treatment than afterwards. After the salt stress treatment, the transgenic lines L-4 and L-8 showed higher values for photosynthetic traits, chlorophyll fluorescence, peroxidase and superoxide dismutase activities, and lower malondialdehyde and Na+ contents, compared with those in WT and L-5. These different responses to salt stress suggested that the transcriptional level of the TaLEA and ThbZIP genes differed among the transgenic lines, resulting in a variety of genetic and phenotypic effects. The results of this research can provide a theoretical basis for the genetic engineering of salt-tolerant trees."
https://openalex.org/W2548790579,"Copper is a crucial ion in cells, but needs to be closely controlled due to its toxic potential and ability to catalyse the formation of radicals. In chloroplasts, an important step for the proper functioning of the photosynthetic electron transfer chain is the delivery of copper to plastocyanin in the thylakoid lumen. The main route for copper transport to the thylakoid lumen is driven by two PIB-type ATPases, Heavy Metal ATPase 6 (HMA6) and HMA8, located in the inner membrane of the chloroplast envelope and in the thylakoid membrane, respectively. Here, the crystal structures of the nucleotide binding domain of HMA6 and HMA8 from Arabidopsis thaliana are reported at 1.5Å and 1.75Å resolution, respectively, providing the first structural information on plants Cu+-ATPases. The structures reveal a compact domain, with two short helices on both sides of a twisted beta-sheet. A double mutant, aiding in the crystallization, provides a new crystal contact, but also avoids an internal clash highlighting the benefits of construct modifications. Finally, the histidine in the HP motif of the isolated domains, unable to bind ATP, shows a side chain conformation distinct from nucleotide bound structures."
https://openalex.org/W2546815376,"Habitat complexity can influence predation rates (e.g. by providing refuge) but other ecosystem processes and species interactions might also be modulated by the properties of habitat structure. Here, we focussed on how complexity of artificial habitat (plastic plants), in microcosms, influenced short-term processes driven by three aquatic detritivores. The effects of habitat complexity on leaf decomposition, production of fine organic matter and pH levels were explored by measuring complexity in three ways: 1. as the presence vs. absence of habitat structure; 2. as the amount of structure (3 or 4.5 g of plastic plants); and 3. as the spatial configuration of structures (measured as fractal dimension). The experiment also addressed potential interactions among the consumers by running all possible species combinations. In the experimental microcosms, habitat complexity influenced how species performed, especially when comparing structure present vs. structure absent. Treatments with structure showed higher fine particulate matter production and lower pH compared to treatments without structures and this was probably due to higher digestion and respiration when structures were present. When we explored the effects of the different complexity levels, we found that the amount of structure added explained more than the fractal dimension of the structures. We give a detailed overview of the experimental design, statistical models and R codes, because our statistical analysis can be applied to other study systems (and disciplines such as restoration ecology). We further make suggestions of how to optimise statistical power when artificially assembling, and analysing, ‘habitat complexity’ by not confounding complexity with the amount of structure added. In summary, this study highlights the importance of habitat complexity for energy flow and the maintenance of ecosystem processes in aquatic ecosystems."
https://openalex.org/W2547196022,"We previously isolated AF20, a murine monoclonal antibody that recognizes a cell surface glycoprotein of approximately 90–110 kDa. The AF20 antigen is specifically expressed in human hepatoma and colon cancer cell lines, and thus could serve as a cancer biomarker. To uncover the molecular identity of the AF20 antigen, a combination of ion-exchange chromatography, immunoprecipitation, and SDS—polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was employed to purify the AF20 antigen followed by trypsin digestion and mass spectrometry. Surprisingly, three host proteins were thus purified from human hepatoma and colon cancer cell lines: transferrin receptor 1 (TFR1), heat shock protein 90 (HSP90), and Na+/K+ ATPase or Mg++ ATPase. Co-immunoprecipitation followed by Western blot analysis confirmed interaction among the three proteins. However, only the cDNA encoding TFR1 conferred strong cell surface staining by the AF20 antibody following its transient transfection into a cell line lacking endogenous AF20. In support of the molecular identity of AF20 as TFR1, diferric but not iron-free transferrin could prevent AF20 antigen-antibody interaction during immunoprecipitation. Moreover, very similar patterns of AF20 and TFR1 overexpression was documented in colon cancer tissues. In conclusion, AF20 is glycosylated TFR1. This finding could explain the molecular structure of AF20, its cell surface localization, as well as overexpression in cancer cells. Glycosylated TFR1 should serve as a usefulness target for anti-cancer therapy, or a vehicle for delivery of anti-tumor drugs with high affinity and specificity. The biological significance of the complex formation between TFR1, HSP90, and/or transporting ATPase warrants further investigation."
https://openalex.org/W2533741673,"Background Total hip replacement for end stage arthritis of the hip is currently the most common elective surgical procedure. In 2007 about 7.5% of UK implants were metal-on-metal joint resurfacing (MoM RS) procedures. Due to poor revision performance and concerns about metal debris, the use of RS had declined by 2012 to about a 1% share of UK hip procedures. This study estimated the lifetime cost-effectiveness of metal-on-metal resurfacing (RS) procedures versus commonly employed total hip replacement (THR) methods. Methodology/Principal Findings We performed a cost-utility analysis using a well-established multi-state semi-Markov model from an NHS and personal and social services perspective. We used individual patient data (IPD) from the National Joint Registry (NJR) for England and Wales on RS and THR surgery for osteoarthritis recorded from April 2003 to December 2012. We used flexible parametric modelling of NJR RS data to guide identification of patient subgroups and RS devices which delivered revision rates within the NICE 5% revision rate benchmark at 10 years. RS procedures overall have an estimated revision rate of 13% at 10 years, compared to <4% for most THR devices. New NICE guidance now recommends a revision rate benchmark of <5% at 10 years. 60% of RS implants in men and 2% in women were predicted to be within the revision benchmark. RS devices satisfying the 5% benchmark were unlikely to be cost-effective compared to THR at a standard UK willingness to pay of £20,000 per quality-adjusted life-year. However, the probability of cost effectiveness was sensitive to small changes in the costs of devices or in quality of life or revision rate estimates. Conclusion/Significance Our results imply that in most cases RS has not been a cost-effective resource and should probably not be adopted by decision makers concerned with the cost effectiveness of hip replacement, or by patients concerned about the likelihood of revision, regardless of patient age or gender."
