https://openalex.org/W1583767403,"Hepatic gluconeogenesis is absolutely required for survival during prolonged fasting or starvation, but is inappropriately activated in diabetes mellitus. Glucocorticoids and glucagon have strong gluconeogenic actions on the liver. In contrast, insulin suppresses hepatic gluconeogenesis. Two components known to have important physiological roles in this process are the forkhead transcription factor FOXO1 (also known as FKHR) and peroxisome proliferative activated receptor-gamma co-activator 1 (PGC-1alpha; also known as PPARGC1), a transcriptional co-activator; whether and how these factors collaborate has not been clear. Using wild-type and mutant alleles of FOXO1, here we show that PGC-1alpha binds and co-activates FOXO1 in a manner inhibited by Akt-mediated phosphorylation. Furthermore, FOXO1 function is required for the robust activation of gluconeogenic gene expression in hepatic cells and in mouse liver by PGC-1alpha. Insulin suppresses gluconeogenesis stimulated by PGC-1alpha but co-expression of a mutant allele of FOXO1 insensitive to insulin completely reverses this suppression in hepatocytes or transgenic mice. We conclude that FOXO1 and PGC-1alpha interact in the execution of a programme of powerful, insulin-regulated gluconeogenesis."

https://openalex.org/W2002837591,"Atopic or immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated diseases include the common disorders of asthma, atopic dermatitis and allergic rhinitis. Chromosome 13q14 shows consistent linkage to atopy and the total serum IgE concentration. We previously identified association between total serum IgE levels and a novel 13q14 microsatellite (USAT24G1; ref. 7) and have now localized the underlying quantitative-trait locus (QTL) in a comprehensive single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) map. We found replicated association to IgE levels that was attributed to several alleles in a single gene, PHF11. We also found association with these variants to severe clinical asthma. The gene product (PHF11) contains two PHD zinc fingers and probably regulates transcription. Distinctive splice variants were expressed in immune tissues and cells."

https://openalex.org/W2107117748,"M-type (KCNQ2/3) potassium channels are suppressed by activation of G(q/11)-coupled receptors, thereby increasing neuronal excitability. We show here that rat KCNQ2 can bind directly to the multivalent A-kinase-anchoring protein AKAP150. Peptides that block AKAP150 binding to the KCNQ2 channel complex antagonize the muscarinic inhibition of the currents. A mutant form of AKAP150, AKAP(DeltaA), which is unable to bind protein kinase C (PKC), also attenuates the agonist-induced current suppression. Analysis of recombinant KCNQ2 channels suggests that targeting of PKC through association with AKAP150 is important for the inhibition. Phosphorylation of KCNQ2 channels was increased by muscarinic stimulation; this was prevented either by coexpression with AKAP(DeltaA) or pretreatment with PKC inhibitors that compete with diacylglycerol. These inhibitors also reduced muscarinic inhibition of M-current. Our data indicate that AKAP150-bound PKC participates in receptor-induced inhibition of the M-current."

Overexpression studies have identified Cbl-mediated ubiquitinylation of EGFR as a mechanism of ligand-induced EGFR down-regulation. However, the role of endogenous Cbl in EGFR down-regulation and the precise step in the endocytic pathway regulated by Cbl remain unclear. Using Cbl–/– mouse embryonic fibroblast cell lines, we demonstrate that endogenous Cbl is essential for ligand-induced ubiquitinylation and efficient degradation of EGFR. Further analyses using Chinese hamster ovary cells with a temperature-sensitive defect in ubiquitinylation confirm a crucial role of the ubiquitin machinery in Cbl-mediated EGFR degradation. However, internalization into early endosomes did not require Cbl function or an intact ubiquitin pathway. Confocal immunolocalization studies indicated that Cbl-dependent ubiquitinylation plays a critical role at the early endosome to late endosome/lysosome sorting step of EGFR down-regulation. These findings establish Cbl as the major endogenous ubiquitin ligase responsible for EGFR degradation, and show that the critical role of Cbl-mediated ubiquitinylation is at the level of endosomal sorting, rather than at the level of internalization.

Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR/ErbB1) is a member of the ErbB family (ErbB1–4) of RTKs, which play crucial homeostatic roles and are implicated in oncogenesis. Ligand-induced activation of RTKs leads to the assembly of signaling protein complexes and subsequent activation of downstream signaling pathways. The ligand-activated RTKs also undergo rapid endocytosis (1Vieira A.V. Lamaze C. Schmid S.L. Science. 1996; 274: 2086-2089Crossref PubMed Scopus (818) Google Scholar). The endocytosed receptors then undergo a sorting process, which determines receptor fate and signal intensity. The receptors can be targeted to the lysosome for degradation, which terminates receptor signals. Alternatively, the internalized receptors can be recycled back to the cell surface for continued ligand binding and signaling (2Herbst J.J. Opresko L.K. Walsh B.J. Lauffenburger D.A. Wiley H.S. J.

The relative efficiency of lysosomal sorting versus recycling is a key determinant of the signaling potency of RTKs (6Waterman H. Sabanai I. Geiger B. Yarden Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13819-13827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). For example, EGFR is predominantly delivered to lysosomes when activated by EGF. In contrast, heregulin-activated ErbB2 is primarily recycled. The greater efficiency of the recycling process is thought to be a major determinant of the signaling superiority of ErbB2 over EGFR (7Lenferink A.E. Pinkas-Kramarski R. van de Poll M.L. van Vugt M.J. Klapper L.N. Tzahar E. Waterman H. Sela M. van Zoelen E.J. Yarden Y.

Despite a critical role of endocytic sorting as a determinant of ErbB receptor down-regulation, the biochemical mechanisms that regulate this process have only recently begun to be elucidated. We, and others, have identified Cbl as one such regulator (10Waterman H. Yarden Y. FEBS Lett. 2001; 490: 142-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 11Rao N. Dodge I. Band H. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2002; 71: 753-763PubMed Google Scholar, 12Thien C.B. Langdon W.Y. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 294-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). Cbl is recruited to the activated EGFR through both direct and indirect binding. Direct Cbl-EGFR interaction is mediated through the N-terminal tyrosine kinase-binding domain of Cbl, which binds to phosphorylated Tyr-1045 on EGFR (13Levkowitz G. Waterman H. Ettenberg S.A. Katz M. Tsygankov A.Y. Alroy I. Lavi S. Iwai K. Reiss Y. Ciechanover A. Lipkowitz S. Yarden Y. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 1029-1040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar). Indirect Cbl-EGFR interaction is primarily mediated through Grb2: the SH3 domain of Grb2 binds to proline-rich sequences in Cbl, whereas the SH2 domain binds to auto-phosphorylated EGFR (14Fukazawa T. Miyake S. Band V. Band H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14554-14559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The RING finger domain in Cbl binds to ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (E2s), allowing Cbl to function as a ubiquitin ligase (E3) toward activated EGFR (15Joazeiro C.A. Wing S.S. Huang H. Leverson J.D. Hunter T. Liu Y.C. Science. 1999; 286: 309-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (907) Google Scholar, 16Zheng N. Wang P. Jeffrey P.D. Pavletich N.P. Cell. 2000; 102: 533-539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar). Overexpression studies have demonstrated that Cbl-mediated ubiquitinylation promotes down-regulation of EGFR, whereas Cbl proteins with mutations in the RING finger domain, or in a conserved helix connecting the RING finger and tyrosine kinase-binding domains, reduce the extent of EGFR ubiquitinylation and down-regulation (17Lill N.L. Douillard P. Awwad R.A. Ota S. Lupher Jr., M.L. Miyake S. Meissner-Lula N. Hsu V.W. Band H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 367-377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 18Thien C.B. Walker F. Langdon W.Y. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 355-365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 19Longva K.E. Blystad F.D. Stang E. Larsen A.M. Johannessen L.E. Madshus I.H. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 843-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). It has not been established, however, whether endogenous Cbl-mediated ubiquitinylation plays an essential role in EGFR degradation. Two potential mechanisms for Cbl-mediated, and ubiquitinylation-dependent, EGFR down-regulation have been proposed. First, a role for Cbl-mediated ubiquitinylation in EGFR endocytosis has been postulated based on the well established role of ubiquitinylation in the endocytosis of yeast pheromone receptors (20Hicke L. Riezman H. Cell. 1996; 84: 277-287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar, 21Dunn R. Hicke L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25974-25981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), and the apparent requirement for the ubiquitin pathway in mammalian growth hormone receptor internalization (22Govers R. ten Broeke T. van Kerkhof P. Schwartz A.L. Strous G.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 28-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Consistent with this possibility, Cbl was also recently found to associate with a CIN85-endophilin complex and to facilitate the monoubiquitinylation of CIN85 (23Haglund K. Shimokawa N. Szymkiewicz I. Dikic I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 12191-12196Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Because a truncated CIN85 mutant that did not associate with Cbl impaired the rate of EGFR internalization, the investigators concluded that Cbl played a role in EGFR endocytosis by serving as an adaptor to link EGFR with CIN85 and endophilin (24Soubeyran P. Kowanetz K. Szymkiewicz I. Langdon W.Y. Dikic I. Nature. 2002; 416: 183-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). Another study arrived at a similar conclusion in the context of the RTK c-MET (25Petrelli A. Gilestro G.F. Lanzardo S. Comoglio P.M. Migone N. Giordano S. Nature. 2002; 416: 187-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). More recently, the EGFR Y1068F/Y1086F mutant, which is unable to bind Grb2, was also found to be impaired for endocytosis (26Jiang X. Huang F. Marusyk A. Sorkin A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 858-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Interestingly, this mutant was also unable to efficiently recruit Cbl to EGFR, and showed impaired ubiquitinylation. Collectively, these studies suggest a role for Cbl, and Cbl-regulated ubiquitinylation, in EGFR endocytosis. Other studies, however, argue against a role for Cbl-mediated ubiquitinylation in the initial internalization of EGFR. For example, even though EGFR ubiquitinylation occurs at the cell surface, it did not appear to be required for endocytosis (19Longva K.E. Blystad F.D. Stang E. Larsen A.M. Johannessen L.E. Madshus I.H. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 843-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 27de Melker A.A. van der Horst G. Calafat J. Jansen H. Borst J. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2167-2178Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, both ubiquitinylation and proteasome activity were needed for transferring EGFR into internal vesicles of the multivesicular body (19Longva K.E. Blystad F.D. Stang E. Larsen A.M. Johannessen L.E. Madshus I.H. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 843-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). In other studies, dominant-negative Cbl mutants were found to prevent down-regulation of EGFR, but EGFR was seen to undergo ligand-induced localization to intracellular vesicular structures (17Lill N.L. Douillard P. Awwad R.A. Ota S. Lupher Jr., M.L. Miyake S. Meissner-Lula N. Hsu V.W. Band H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 367-377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the rate of initial internalization did not correlate with the ability of overexpressed Cbl mutants to inhibit EGFR down-regulation (18Thien C.B. Walker F. Langdon W.Y. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 355-365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). These results support a role for Cbl and ubiquitinylation at a late step in the endocytic pathway, rather than at the initial internalization step. The relative contribution of these alternate mechanisms in Cbl-mediated down-regulation of EGFR has not been clarified. In the present study, we used Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells conditionally defective in ubiquitinylation, and Cbl-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells, to address the role of Cbl and Cbl-mediated ubiquitinylation in the internalization, endosomal sorting, and degradation of EGFR. We demonstrate that Cbl-mediated EGFR ubiquitinylation is required for efficient sorting of activated EGFR into the lysosome for its degradation. In contrast, neither Cbl nor Cbl-mediated ubiquitinylation are required for initial EGFR endocytosis.

Transfections—Transient or stable transfectants of CHO-Ts20, CHO-E36 expressing human EGFR (or its mutants), were generated by FuGENE-6-mediated transfection of pcDNA3-EGFR, according to the manufacturer's instructions. Transfectants were selected in media containing 0.5 mg/ml G418 (Invitrogen) and clones were analyzed for EGFR expression by immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting (described below). Stable transfectants of Cbl+/+ and Cbl–/– MEFs expressing human EGFR were established by retroviral infection as described previously (39Bonita D.P. Miyake S. Lupher Jr., M.L. Langdon W.Y. Band H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4597-4610Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were selected in puromycin (Sigma; 2.5 μg/ml) and bulk transfectants were analyzed for EGFR expression using fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) analysis with mAb 528 and immunoblotting with sc-03 anti-EGFR antibody. Transfections were carried out with the FuGENE-6 reagent. The amounts of input DNA are indicated in the figure legends. Cells were harvested at 48 h after the addition of DNA precipitates. EGF Stimulation and Preparation of Cell Lysates—For EGF stimulation, cells were placed in starvation medium (growth medium containing 0.5% fetal bovine serum) for 4–6 h and then incubated with purified murine EGF (catalog number E-4127, Sigma) for various lengths of time and at concentrations indicated in figure legends. Cells were rinsed with ice-cold PBS and lysed in 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mm sodium chloride, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.07 trypsin inhibitor units/ml of aprotinin, and 1 μg/ml each of leupeptin, pepstatin, antipain, and chymostatin (Sigma) (40Lupher Jr., M.L.

Lysate protein concentration was determined using the Bradford method (Bio-Rad). Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—These procedures have been described previously (14Fukazawa T. Miyake S.

Cells were stained with the appropriate primary antibody (4 μg/ml anti-EGFR mAb 528 or 1:500 anti-LAMP-1 pAb in blocking buffer) and followed with 1:300 dilution of goat anti-mouse IgG (H+L) F(ab′)2-Cy3 and anti-rabbit IgG F(ab′)2-Cy2. Coverslips were mounted on glass slides using Fluoromount-G. Confocal microscopy was carried out using a Leica TCS-NT confocal laser scanning microscope fitted with krypton and argon lasers, as previously described (41Rogers R.A. Jack R.M. Furlong S.T. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 106: 485-491PubMed Google Scholar). Assessment of EGFR Internalization—Cells were grown on 10-cm tissue culture dishes to 70–80% confluence. Following serum starvation for 4–6 h, the cells were incubated with 25 ng/ml Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated EGF at 4 °C for 30 min, washed 3 times with cold PBS, and incubated at normal cell growth temperature for the indicated time points to allow internalization. The cells were placed on ice to stop internalization, rinsed 3 times with cold PBS, and subjected to an acid wash (0.2 m acetic acid and 0.5 m NaCl, pH 2.8) for 5 min. Non-internalized EGF was removed by 3 washes with PBS, and the cells were detached from tissue culture dishes using a rubber scraper. Cells were washed and suspended in FACS buffer (2% fetal bovine serum and 0.01% sodium azide in PBS), and fixed by adding an equal volume of 4% formaldehyde/PBS. Fluorescence emission because of internalized EGF was detected by flow cytometry. Mean fluorescence intensity of cells after EGF binding but without the acid wash was set to 100%, percentage internalization was calculated after subtracting background (fluorescence of cells subjected to acid wash without allowing internalization). Flow cytometry, data collection, and analysis were performed on a FACSort machine using CellQuest software (BD Biosciences). Each experiment was done in triplicate 3 times. Values are expressed as a percentage of initial EGF binding. The data was analyzed statistically with Prism (Graphpad Software, Inc.) by using Student's t test and one-way analysis of variance. All of the values from a representative experiment are plotted. The median is connected by a line, and the range from maximum to minimum is expressed as an error bar. Down-regulation of Cell Surface EGFR—Down-regulation of EGFR from the cell surface was assessed as previously described (17Lill N.L. Douillard P. Awwad R.A. Ota S. Lupher Jr., M.L. Miyake S.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15547-15552Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar); these cell lines are designated Cbl+/+(DB) and Cbl–/–(DB), and Cbl+/+(HG) and Cbl–/–(HG), respectively. Western blotting of whole cell lysates confirmed the Cbl protein expression in the Cbl+/+ MEFs but not in either of the Cbl–/– MEFs (Fig. 1A). The Cbl–/–(DB) MEFs express low levels of a truncated Cbl protein (data not shown) representing a nonfunctional splice product, as previously reported (34Murphy M.A. Schnall R.G. Venter D.J.

Ota S. Bowtell D.D. Scaife R.M. Langdon W.Y. Band H. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 851-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Because other Cbl family members, such as Cbl-b and Cbl-c, may also play a role in EGFR down-regulation (43Ettenberg S.A. Rubinstein Y.R. Banerjee P. Nau M.M. Keane M.M. Lipkowitz S. Mol. Cell. Biol. Res. Commun. 1999; 2: 111-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 44Ettenberg S.A. Magnifico A. Cuello M. Nau M.M. Rubinstein Y.R. Yarden Y. Weissman A.M. Lipkowitz S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27677-27684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), we wished to determine the level of expression of Cbl-b and Cbl-c in these MEFs. To assess the expression of Cbl-b, we used an antibody (H454) that recognizes both Cbl and Cbl-b (determined using HA-tagged Cbl and Cbl-b proteins; data not shown). We found that Cbl-b protein was detectable in the lysates of Cbl+/+ and Cbl–/– MEFs from which all Cbl protein had been immunodepleted using a Cbl-specific antibody (Fig. 1B , lanes 5–8); notably, the level of Cbl-b protein was substantially lower in the Cbl–/–(HG) MEFs. We also assayed for the presence of Cbl-c by Northern blot, as no antibody is currently available; the Cbl-c mRNA levels were nearly undetectable in all MEFs and there was no compensatory increase in Cbl–/– cells (data not shown). Whereas the reasons for reduced Cbl-b expression in the Cbl–/–(HG) MEFs are unknown, this trait was advantageous to assess the contribution of endogenous Cbl to EGFR down-regulation. To analyze the impact of Cbl deficiency on EGFR down-regulation, we used retroviral infection to derive stable transfectants of the Cbl+/+ and Cbl–/– MEFs expressing human EGFR on the cell surface (Fig. 1, C and D). As Cbl is an EGFR-directed ubiquitin ligase (10Waterman H. Yarden Y. FEBS Lett. 2001; 490: 142-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 11Rao N. Dodge I. Band H. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2002; 71: 753-763PubMed Google Scholar, 12Thien C.B. Langdon W.Y. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 294-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar), we first assessed the ligand-induced EGFR ubiquitinylation in EGFR-expressing Cbl+/+ and Cbl–/– MEFs. Serum-starved cells were stimulated with EGF for various times, and anti-EGFR immunoprecipitates (IPs) were subjected to immunoblotting (IB) with an anti-ubiquitin antibody. As anticipated, ligand-dependent ubiquitinylation of EGFR was readily detected in both Cbl+/+ MEF lines (DB and HG; Fig. 2A). Notably, ligand-induced EGFR ubiquitinylation in both Cbl–/– MEF lines was greatly reduced, indicating that endogenous Cbl is the major ubiquitin ligase involved in EGFR ubiquitinylation in MEFs. Importantly, anti-EGFR blotting of anti-EGFR IPs (Fig. 2A , second panel) or whole cell lysates (Fig. 2B) revealed that the ligand-induced loss of EGFR protein was substantially slower in both Cbl–/– MEFs; concomitantly, we observed a slower and less pronounced loss of phosphotyrosine (Tyr(P)) signals on EGFR (Fig. 2A , bottom panel). The pattern of EGFR phosphorylation also indicates that impaired EGFR ubiquitinylation in Cbl–/– cells is not because of defective EGFR activation. To establish that defective EGFR ubiquitinylation and degradation in Cbl–/– MEFs was because of the lack of Cbl expression, and not an artifact of cell line derivation, we reconstituted Cbl expression in the EGFR-expressing Cbl–/–(HG) MEFs. IB of whole cell lysates demonstrated that retrovirus-mediated introduction of HA-tagged Cbl led to reconstitution of Cbl expression in Cbl–/–(HG) MEFs (Fig. 2C). Comparison of the HA-Cbl-transfected versus the vector-transfected cells demonstrated that reconstitution with Cbl fully restored the EGF-induced ubiquitinylation and degradation of EGFR (Fig. 2, D and E). Thus, the defect in EGFR ubiquitinylation and degradation in Cbl–/–(HG) MEFs is solely because of lack of Cbl expression. Overall, the results with Cbl–/– MEFs and their Cbl-reconstituted derivatives establish a clear role for endogenous Cbl in ligand-induced EGFR ubiquitinylation and degradation. EGFR Internalization Is Unaltered in Cbl –/– MEFs—The precise site(s) of Cbl action in the endocytic trafficking of EGFR has not been clarified. Based on the formation of a Cbl-CIN85-endophilin complex, a recent set of studies concluded that Cbl plays an important role in the initial internalization of EGFR (24Soubeyran P. Kowanetz K. Szymkiewicz I. Langdon W.Y. Dikic I. Nature. 2002; 416: 183-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar, 25Petrelli A. Gilestro G.F. Lanzardo S. Comoglio P.M. Migone N. Giordano S. Nature. 2002; 416: 187-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). In addition, an EGFR mutant unable to bind Grb2 was impaired in its ability to form an EGFR-Grb2-Cbl complex, and to undergo ligand-induced ubiquitinylation, and internalization, further suggesting a role for Cbl-mediated ubiquitinylation in EGFR internalization (26Jiang X. Huang F. Marusyk A. Sorkin A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 858-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). However, whether the effects of the CIN85 mutant are because of the loss of a Cbl-CIN85 interaction or of other protein-protein interactions, or whether Cbl-EGFR interaction through Grb2 is required for EGFR internalization, have not been established. In fact, the N-terminal half of Cbl, which included only the tyrosine kinase-binding and RING finger domains and lacked both the CIN85 and Grb2 interaction sites, was sufficient to enhance the ubiquitinylation and degradation of EGFR (13Levkowitz G. Waterman H. Ettenberg S.A. Katz M. Tsygankov A.Y. Alroy I. Lavi S. Iwai K. Reiss Y. Ciechanover A. Lipkowitz S. Yarden Y. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 1029-104"
https://openalex.org/W1992758160,"The transcription factors Aft1p and Aft2p from Saccharomyces cerevisiae regulate the expression of genes that are involved in iron homeostasis. In vitro studies have shown that both transcription factors bind to an iron-responsive element (FeRE) that is present in the upstream region of genes in the iron regulon. We have used DNA microarrays to distinguish the genes that are activated by Aft1p and Aft2p and to establish for the first time that each factor gives rise to a unique transcriptional profile due to the differential expression of individual iron-regulated genes. We also show that both Aft1p and Aft2p mediate the in vivo expression of FET3 and FIT3 through a consensus FeRE. In addition, both proteins regulate MRS4 via a variant FeRE with Aft2p being the stronger activator from this particular element. Like other paralogous pairs of transcription factors within S. cerevisiae, Aft1p and Aft2p are able to interact with the same promoter elements while maintaining specificity of gene activation. The transcription factors Aft1p and Aft2p from Saccharomyces cerevisiae regulate the expression of genes that are involved in iron homeostasis.

Like other paralogous pairs of transcription factors within S. cerevisiae, Aft1p and Aft2p are able to interact with the same promoter elements while maintaining specificity of gene activation. Saccharomyces cerevisiae contains paralogous gene pairs that code for transcription factors that can have both overlapping and distinct functions. These transcription factors bind to the same promoter elements but generate distinct transcriptional profiles. Included in this group are Ace2p/Swi5p, Pdr1p/Pdr3p, and Yap1/Yap2p. Ace2p and Swi5p regulate the expression of cell cycle-specific genes, are 83% identical in their zinc finger DNA-binding domains and recognize the same DNA binding site in vitro (1Dohrmann P.R. Butler G. Tamai K. Dorland S. Greene J.R. Thiele D.J. Stillman D.J. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 93-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 2Dohrmann P.R. Voth W.P. Stillman D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1746-1758Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). However, Ace2p and Swi5p can regulate separate genes, where discrimination between promoter elements is achieved through the interaction of these factors with other DNA-binding proteins (2Dohrmann P.R. Voth W.P. Stillman D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1746-1758Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Alternatively, in cases where both transcription factors can induce the expression of the same gene, one is often the more potent activator (3Toone W.M. Johnson A.L. Banks G.R. Toyn J.H. Stuart D. Wittenberg C. Johnston L.H. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5824-5832Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). There are genes that require both Ace2p and Swi5p for maximal expression and others that are antagonistically regulated by these factors (4Doolin M.T. Johnson A.L. Johnston L.H. Butler G. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 40: 422-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Pdr1p and Pdr3p share 36% identity and regulate the expression of genes that are involved in pleiotropic drug resistance. Both these factors are able to bind to the same DNA element (PDRE) in vivo as either hetero- or homodimers (5Mamnun Y.M. Pandjaitan R. Mahe Y. Delahodde A. Kuchler K. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 46: 1429-1440Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Differential expression of Pdr1p/Pdr3p target genes may therefore involve different combinations of Pdr1p/Pdr3p at different PDREs (5Mamnun Y.M. Pandjaitan R. Mahe Y. Delahodde A. Kuchler K. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 46: 1429-1440Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Yap1p and Yap2p are 88% identical in their DNA binding regions and bind to the same consensus site (6Fernandes L. Rodrigues-Pousada C. Struhl K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 17: 6982-6993Crossref Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Analysis of global gene expression using microarrays has shown that although Yap1p and Yap2p are both involved in the response to cellular stresses, they regulate different regulons (7Cohen B.A. Pilpel Y. Mitra R.D. Church G.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 1608-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The mechanism(s) of Yap1p/Yap2p gene selectivity are not understood but may include variations in the base pairs flanking the consensus Yap binding site (7Cohen B.A. Pilpel Y. Mitra R.D. Church G.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 1608-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The iron regulon of S. cerevisiae is well characterized and includes genes that are involved in the uptake, compartmentalization and use of iron. These include genes that encode siderophore transporters (ARN1–4), iron reductases (FRE1–6), iron permeases (FTR1, FET4), and multicopper oxidases that are involved in the coordinated oxidation and transport of iron across membranes (FET3, FET5) (8Martins L.

In addition, three related genes (FIT1-FIT3) encode proteins that localize within the yeast cell wall and whose function is partially related to siderophore uptake (13Protchenko O. Ferea T.

Genes within the iron regulon are induced under low iron conditions and are regulated by the transcription factors, Aft1p and Aft2p (14Yamaguchi-iwai Y. Stearman R. Dancis A. Klausner D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3377-3384Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar, 15Rutherford J.C. Jaron S. Ray E. Brown P.O. Winge D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Aft1p and Aft2p are 39% identical within their N-terminal regions, which contain the DNA binding domain of each protein (15Rutherford J.C. Jaron S. Ray E. Brown P.O. Winge D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14322-14327Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The activation domain of Aft1p is within its C-terminal 413–572 amino acid residues which, when fused to the Gal4p DNA binding domain, activates transcription in an iron-independent manner (16Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Ueta R. Fukunaka A. Sasaki R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18914-18918Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). In addition, the N-terminal region of Aft1p contains a nuclear export signal that mediates differential cellular localization of Aft1p in response to iron (16Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Ueta R. Fukunaka A. Sasaki R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18914-18918Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Aft1p is localized to the cytosol under iron-replete conditions, but is nuclear and active in iron-deficient conditions. Mutant alleles of AFT1 and AFT2 (AFT1-1up and AFT2-1up respectively) have been identified that result in the iron-independent activation of the iron regulon (14Yamaguchi-iwai Y. Stearman R. Dancis A. Klausner D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3377-3384Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar, 15Rutherford J.C. Jaron S. Ray E. Brown P.O. Winge D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14322-14327Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). These gain of function mutations result from a single cysteine to phenylalanine substitution in identical regions of Aft1p and Aft2p. A strain that lacks a functional Aft1p (aft1Δ) grows poorly in iron-limiting conditions and exhibits reduced iron uptake and cell surface iron-reductase activity (14Yamaguchi-iwai Y. Stearman R. Dancis A. Klausner D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3377-3384Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar, 17Casas C. Aldea M. Espinet C. Gallego C. Gil R. Herero E. Yeast. 1997; 13: 621-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The vector-borne AFT2-1up allele is able to partially restore iron uptake in the aft1Δ strain (15Rutherford J.C. Jaron S. Ray E. Brown P.O. Winge D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14322-14327Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The aft2Δ strain has no growth phenotype on iron-limiting medium (15Rutherford J.C. Jaron S. Ray E. Brown P.O. Winge D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14322-14327Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). However, the aft1Δ aft2Δ strain is more sensitive to iron-limiting conditions than the single aft1Δ strain (15Rutherford J.C. Jaron S. Ray E. Brown P.O. Winge D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14322-14327Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 18Blaiseau P.-L. Lesuisse E. Camadro J.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34221-34226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The aft1Δ strain also fails to grow with glycerol as a respiratory carbon source, and this phenotype is partially restored by complementation with low copy plasmids containing the AFT2 or AFT2-1up alleles (15Rutherford J.C. Jaron S. Ray E. Brown P.O. Winge D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14322-14327Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Analysis of global gene expression has shown that the AFT2-1up allele activates the expression of a subset of the iron regulon (15Rutherford J.C. Jaron S. Ray E. Brown P.O. Winge D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14322-14327Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). However, our previous microarray analysis did not compare transcript profiles for both AFT2-1up and AFT1-1up cells. Additionally, the AFT1-1up and the AFT2-1up alleles differentially regulate the expression of two iron-regulated genes (MRS4 and FIT2) (15Rutherford J.C. Jaron S. Ray E. Brown P.O. Winge D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14322-14327Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Aft1p mediates transcriptional regulation through an iron-responsive element (FeRE) 1The abbreviations used are: FeRE, iron-responsive element; ORF, open reading frame; CMD, complete-synthetic medium; UAS, upstream activation sequence. that has the consensus sequence PyPuCACCCPu (14Yamaguchi-iwai Y. Stearman R. Dancis A. Klausner D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3377-3384Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). The FeRE was identified by the in vivo analysis of the FET3 promoter region using lacZ fusion constructs and DNA footprinting (14Yamaguchi-iwai Y. Stearman R. Dancis A. Klausner D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3377-3384Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Aft1p binds to the FET3 FeRE in vivo in an iron-dependent manner. Sequences similar to the FET3 FeRE were identified in the promoter regions of five other known iron-regulated genes. In vitro assays confirmed the binding of Aft1p to these particular sequences, from which the consensus FeRE sequence was derived (14Yamaguchi-iwai Y. Stearman R. Dancis A. Klausner D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3377-3384Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). SMF3, that encodes a metal transporter, is also iron-regulated in an Aft1p/Aft2p-dependent manner through a consensus FeRE (19Portnoy M.E. Jensen L.T. Culotta V.C. Biochem. J. 2002; 362: 119-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). N-terminal truncates of Aft1p and Aft2p bind to the FET3 FeRE in vitro, consistent with both factors regulating the iron regulon through the consensus FeRE (15Rutherford J.C. Jaron S. Ray E. Brown P.O. Winge D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14322-14327Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Expression of AFT2 from a high copy plasmid, but not the chromosomal copy of AFT2, activates the expression of a lacZ reporter under the control of the FET3 FeRE in an iron-dependent manner (18Blaiseau P.-L. Lesuisse E. Camadro J.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34221-34226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). However, the high expression of one of a pair of transcription factors can result in the aberrant activation of genes that are specifically regulated by the other factor (2Dohrmann P.R. Voth W.P. Stillman D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1746-1758Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). It is therefore not clear to what extent Aft1p and Aft2p interact with the same responsive element in vivo. The evidence is therefore consistent with Aft1p and Aft2p having overlapping but non-redundant roles in the transcriptional regulation of the iron regulon in S. cerevisiae. We are interested in understanding the selective advantage of this organism having two iron-responsive transcription factors. In this study, microarray experiments have been used to further define the activities of the gain of function mutants and demonstrate that they give rise to different global transcriptional profiles. We have also analyzed the ability of Aft1p and Aft2p to activate transcription through the same consensus FeRE. In vivo lacZ reporter constructs show clearly that Aft1p and Aft2p activate gene expression through the consensus FeREs in the FET3 and FIT3 promoter regions. Both Aft1p and Aft2p also induce the activation of MRS4 through a variant FeRE. An extended FeRE has been identified that is overrepresented in the genes that are most highly induced by the AFT1-1up and AFT2-1up alleles. Yeast Strains and Culture Conditions—Haploid aft1Δaft2Δ strains were isolated following the mating of the strains, BY4741aft2Δ (MATa his3Δ1 leu2Δ0 met15Δ0 ura3Δ0 aft2::kanMX4) and BY4742aft1Δ (MATα his3Δ1 leu2Δ0 lys2Δ0 ura3Δ0 aft1::kanMX4), which were purchased from Research Genetics. A strain containing a copy of the AFT2-1up allele integrated at the HIS3 locus was generated by transforming a haploid aft1Δaft2Δ strain (MATα his3Δ1 leu2Δ0 ura3Δ0 aft1::kanMX4 aft2::kanMX4) with plasmid pAFT2-1upINT that had been linearized using MscI and selecting for growth on agar plates lacking histidine. The allele status of the aft1Δaft2Δ strains and the integration of the AFT2-1up allele at the HIS3 locus were verified using PCR and DNA sequencing. Cells were grown with 2% glucose as a carbon source, in 1% yeast extract, 2% peptone medium (YPD), complete-synthetic medium (CMD) or, when appropriate, complete-synthetic medium lacking uracil and/or histidine (CMD-Ura, CMD-His, CMD-Ura/His). Vectors and Fusion Genes—The YCp plasmids, pAFT1-1up and pAFT2-1up are HIS3 derivatives of pAFT1-1up and pAFT2-1up (15Rutherford J.C. Jaron S. Ray E. Brown P.O. Winge D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14322-14327Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) from which the AFT1 (XhoI/SacI) and AFT2 (BamHI/XbaI) sequences have been subcloned into the YCp plasmid, pRS413. Consequently, the gain of function mutant alleles of AFT1 and AFT2 within pAFT1-1up and pAFT2-1up are under the control of their own promoters (15Rutherford J.C. Jaron S. Ray E. Brown P.O. Winge D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14322-14327Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The integrative vector pAFT2-1upINT was generated by subcloning the AFT2 sequences (XhoI/XbaI) from pAFT2-1up into the YIp plasmid, pRS403. The lacZ reporter constructs, pFC-W and pFC-LM2 were a gift from Andrew Dancis (14Yamaguchi-iwai Y. Stearman R. Dancis A. Klausner D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3377-3384Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). These contain, respectively, a functional and non-functional copy of the FET3 FeRE in a minimal promoter. The plasmid pFET3-lacZ (0.5 kb of the 5′-region of FET3, inclusive of the start codon, fused to the lacZ gene in YEp354, Ref. 20Myers A.M. Tzagoloff A. Kinney D.M. Lusty C.J. Gene. 1986; 45: 299-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar) was a gift from Jerry Kaplan (21Li L. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5036-5043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). To generate a version of pFET3-lacZ in which the same FeRE that is present in pFC-W was mutated to a non-functional FeRE (CACCC to CAGGG), pFET3-lacZ was used as template for QuikChange mutagenesis (Stratagene) using the primer 5′-GGCAAGGCCCATCTTCAAAAGTGCAGGGATTTGCAGGTGCTCTTATTCTCGCC-3′ and its complement to generate pFET3-lacZ (mut). The 0.5-kb fragment containing the FET3 sequences from pFET3-lacZ and pFET3-lacZ (mut) were excised and ligated into the PstI/SmaI sites of Yep354 to generate pFET3-lacZ and pFET3-lacZ (mut) respectively. To generate pFIT3-lacZ (1 kb of 5′-region of FIT3, inclusive of the start codon, fused to the lacZ gene in YEp354) yeast-genomic DNA from strain BY4741 was isolated and used as template for PCR using the primers 5′-CGGGATCCTCCATAAACATTTCCTTTGTC-3′ and 5′-CCAAGCTTTCATTTTAGGGATTATTGTTATTAG-3′. The resulting 1-kb fragment was ligated into the BamHI/HindIII sites of Yep354 to generate pSJDW36. Plasmid pSJDW36 was used as template for QuikChange mutagenesis using the primer 5′-CATCAAAAAATATGGGATAGCGCCCTGCGCAACAAACACCCTGCAAAAAAAAATCTAGGACATAGG-3′ and its complement to mutate two potential FeREs to non-functional FeREs (CACCC to CAGGG) and thereby generate pSJDW36 (mut). The FIT3 sequences from both pSJDW36 and pSJDW36 (mut) were excised and ligated to the BamHI/HindIII sites of Yep354 to generate pFIT3-lacZ and pFIT3-lacZ (mut), respectively. To generate plasmid pMRS4a-lacZ (1 kb of 5′-region of MRS4, inclusive of the start codon, fused to the lacZ gene in YEp354) yeast-genomic DNA from strain BY4741 was used as template for PCR using the primers 5′-CGCACAGGATCCTCGAAGATAGCGTAGCGTTC-3′ and 5′-GGGAGCAAGCTTCATAATATTAACTGATATTTCGGTTG-3′ (primer Mrs4a). The resulting 1-kb fragment was ligated into the BamHI/HindIII sites of pHOLLY to generate pJRDW25. Plasmid pJRDW25 was used as template for PCR using primer Mrs4a with, individually, primers 5′-CGCACAGGATCCCATATTTGGAATTCAGC-3′, 5′-CGCACAGGATCCCCCACAGGAATCGCTAC-3′, 5′-CGCACAGGATCCCGTGTCTCTTTTCGGTA-3′, 5′-CGCACAGGATCCGAATGAGAGCATGGCGA-3′, and 5′-CGCACAGGATCCCTTTTGCCTACCATTGG-3′ to generate sequential truncations of the MRS4 promoter region. The resulting fragments, and the 1-kb BamHI/HindIII fragment from pJRDW25, were ligated into the BamHI/HindIII sites of Yep354 to generate plasmids pMRS4lacZ(a-f). Plasmid pMRS4-lacZd was used as template for QuikChange mutagenesis using the primer 5′-CGAAGACTGAAAGGCAAGAACAGGGTGCTATCTTTTGCCTACCATTG-3′ and its complement and primer 5′-GTCTCTTTTCGGTATTTTGGCAGGGTTTCTTGAATGAGAGCATGGC -3′ and its complement to generate, respectively, plasmids, pMRS4-lacZd (mut1) and pMRS4-lacZd (mut2) that contain CACCC to CAGGG mutations in individual FeRE-like sequences. To generate a reporter construct that contains the FeRE of MRS4 within the ΔUAS CYC1 promoter fused to the lacZ gene, 200 pmol of each of the partial overlapping oligos 5′-tcgaAAGAAAGGGTGCCAAAA-3′ and 5′-ctagTTTTGGCACCCTTTCTT-3′ were mixed in SSC (final 0.32×), boiled for 15 min, and then incubated overnight at 55 °C. The annealed products were then ligated into the XhoI/XbaI sites of pNB404 (22Bachhawat N. Ouyang Q. Henry S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25087-25095Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) to generate pMRS4-FeRE. All PCR-generated sequences were confirmed by DNA sequencing. All yeast transformations were performed using the lithium acetate procedure. In the case of transformations using aft1Δaft2Δ strains, cells were pregrown in YPD under nitrogen and agar plates supplemented with FeCl2 (100 μm). mRNA Quantification by S1 Nuclease Analysis—Strain aft1Δaft2Δ (MAT α his3Δ1 leu2Δ0 ura3Δ0 aft1::kanMX4 aft2::kanMX4) was used for transformation of all lacZ reporter constructs with separately pAFT1-1up , pAFT2-1up or pRS413. Cells were harvested at mid-log phase, and total RNA was extracted using the hot acidic phenol method (31Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. 2. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1997: 13.0.1Google Scholar). DNA oligonucleotides, with sequences complementary to lacZ, FIT3 and CMD1 mRNA (calmodulin as an internal loading control), were end-labeled with 32P using T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs). S1 analysis was carried out as previously described (1Dohrmann P.R. Butler G. Tamai K. Dorland S. Greene J.R. Thiele D.J. Stillman D.J. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 93-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Briefly, the 32P-labeled oligonucleotides were hybridized with 12 μg of total RNA in HEPES buffer (38 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 0.3 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100) at 55 °C overnight. The reactions were then treated with 35 units of S1 nuclease (Promega), and the resulting DNA:RNA double-stranded duplexes were ethanol-precipitated and heat-denatured in formamide buffer. The samples were then separated using an 8% polyacrylamide/8.3 m urea gel. Microarray Analysis—Strain aft1Δaft2Δ (MATa his3Δ1 leu2Δ0 lys2Δ0 met15Δ0 ura3Δ0 aft1::kanMX4 aft2::kanMX4) was transformed with separately, pAFT1-1up , pAFT2-1up and their corresponding parental vectors as controls (pRS316, pRS416). Cells were grown in 300 ml of CMD-Ura medium and harvested at an OD600 nm of 0.4. Total RNA was isolated by the hot acidic phenol method and mRNA was isolated from total RNA using the PolyATtract mRNA Isolation System IV kit (Promega) following the manufacturer's instructions. mRNA (1.2 μg) was used to generate cDNA probes by reverse transcription (Superscript II, GIBCO) with incorporation of Cy3-dCTP or Cy5-dCTP (Amersham Biosciences). The arrayed slides were produced as follows. The PCR amplification products of all the S. cerevisiae open reading frames (ORFs) were purchased from Research Genetics. Each PCR product was reamplified and purified on glass fiber filter plates (Millipore). The reamplified products representing ∼6000 ORFs (4% not represented) were diluted to 50% Me2SO and spotted in duplicate on 3-aminopropyl-methyldiethoxy silane-coated slides using a Generation III Microarray Spotter (Amersham Biosciences). The cDNA-labeled probes were then hybridized onto an arrayed slide and fluorescence was captured with a GEN III dual-laser confocal scanner (Molecular Dynamics). Fluorescent intensities were quantified using Arrayvision 6.0 (Imaging Research). The ratios of signal intensities (Cy5/Cy3) were normalized by the median output signal intensity for all genes, and the normalized data for three independent experiments were averaged. The data were filtered to remove those measurements that were not higher than the slides' background fluorescence and assembled into EXCEL spreadsheets. Analysis of the potential regulatory sequences within the most highly induced genes was carried out using the program GeneSpring 3.2 (Silicon Genetics). The EXCEL spreadsheets containing the normalized, filtered, and averaged data are available as Supplemental Material. Microarray Analysis of Aft1p and Aft2p Regulons—Previous studies have shown that Aft1p and Aft2p differentially activate the expression of a subset of the iron-regulated genes in S. cerevisiae (15Rutherford J.C. Jaron S. Ray E. Brown P.O. Winge D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14322-14327Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). We were interested to learn the effect of Aft1p and Aft2p on global gene expression in cells of the same genetic background. DNA microarray analysis was initiated to compare the expression profile resulting from the AFT1-1up allele and, separately, the AFT2-1up allele. The aft1Δaft2Δ strain was used into which pAFT1-1up , pAFT2-1up and control vectors had been separately transformed. The AFT1-1up /AFT2-1up alleles were expressed from their own promoters in low copy plasmids, so as to minimize the overexpression of the gain of function alleles. The transcriptional profiles of the pAFT1-1up - and the pAFT2-1up -containing strains were separately compared with that of control strains. Each experiment was carried out independently on three occasions. The average induction ratio for each gene was calculated, and the genes that were most highly induced in cells containing the AFT1-1up and AFT2-1up alleles were identified (Tables I and II, Fig. 1). These data will include genes that are the direct targets of Aft1p and/or Aft2p or genes that are activated as the result of the indirect effects of Aft1p/Aft2p.

Open table in a new tab Many of the genes identified as being induced as the result of the AFT1-1up /AFT2-1up alleles are known to code for proteins that are involved in iron metabolism. Some of these genes are induced to a similar extent as the result of either Aft1p or Aft2p (e.g. FRE6, ATX1, COT1). However, the more highly induced genes tend to be activated to a greater extent when Aft1p is present (e.g. FIT3, FIT2, FTR1). There are examples of genes that contain a consensus FeRE but which are only induced as the result of one of the Aft1p/Aft2p factors. These genes include the Aft1p-specific FRE2 and ARN2 and the Aft2p-specific BNA2 and ECM4. BNA2 codes for a protein with similarity to indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenases and Ecm4p is involved in cell wall biosynthesis, although its precise function is not known. Included in the group of genes that are preferentially induced as the result of Aft1p is YOR387C. Interestingly, YOR387C is located within a region of chromosome XV that contains a group of genes (FIT2, FIT3, FRE3) that are highly induced in cells containing either AFT1-1up or AFT2-1up. YOR387C codes for a 206-amino acid protein that shares 93% identity with the mitochondrial Vel1p from S. cerevisiae (23Kumar A. Agarwal S. Heyman J.A. Matson S. Heidtman M. Piccirillo S. Umansky L. Drawid A. Jansen R. Liu Y. Cheung K.H. Miller P. Gerstein M. Roeder G.S. Snyder M. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 707-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar). Common to both experiments are OYE3 and YHL035C, which have not previously been identified as targets of the Aft1p/Aft2p factors. OYE3 codes for a NADPH dehydrogenase and does not contain a consensus FeRE within its 5′-upstream region and consequently may be induced as an indirect result of the Aft1p/Aft2p factors. YHL035C has one consensus FeRE within its 5′-upstream region and codes for a member of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) family of transporters, however its localization and function are unknown. Integration of AFT2-1up Allele—To confirm that the use of plasmid-borne constitutive alleles for the microarray experiments was an appropriate strategy, the AFT2-1up locus, under the control of its own promoter and terminator, was integrated into the HIS3 locus of the aft1Δaft2Δ strain. S1 nuclease protection assays were used to analyze the expression of FIT3 in the aft1Δaft2Δ strain containing a control plasmid or pAFT2-1up , the aft1Δaft2Δ strain with the integrated AFT2-1up allele and the aft1Δ strain. The expression of FIT3 that resulted from the plasmid-borne AFT2-1up allele was only slightly greater than that of the integrated AFT2-1up allele (Fig. 2). Consequently, it is unlikely that the microarray data include genes that have been artificially induced through overexpression of the AFT1-1up and AFT2-1up alleles. Interestingly, the AFT2-1up allele still responds to iron to some extent when it is present in the chromosome, but that response is lost in the strain containing the plasmid-borne AFT2-1up allele. In Vivo Analysis of FET3 FeRE—Truncated Aft1p and Aft2p that contain the N-terminal basic regions of each protein, are able to bind to the FET3 FeRE in vitro (15Rutherford J.C. Jaron S. Ray E.

In addition, oxidative stress and certain environmental factors, including metals, are believed to play an important role in Parkinson's disease. Previously, we have shown that methionine-oxidized human α-synuclein does not fibrillate and also inhibits fibrillation of unmodified α-synuclein (Uversky, V. N., Yamin, G., Souillac, P. O., Goers, J., Glaser, C. B., and Fink, A. L. (2002) FEBS Lett. 517, 239–244). Using dynamic light scattering, we show that the inhibition results from stabilization of the monomeric form of Met-oxidized α-synuclein. We have now examined the effect of several metals on the structural properties of methionine-oxidized human α-synuclein and its propensity to fibrillate. The presence of metals induced partial folding of both oxidized and non-oxidized α-synucleins, which are intrinsically unstructured under conditions of neutral pH. Although the fibrillation of α-synuclein was completely inhibited by methionine oxidation, the presence of certain metals (Ti3+, Zn2+, Al3+, and Pb2+) overcame this inhibition. These findings indicate that a combination of oxidative stress and environmental metal pollution could play an important role in triggering the fibrillation of α-synuclein and thus possibly Parkinson's disease.

Parkinson's disease (PD) 1The abbreviations used are: PD, Parkinson's disease; ThT, thioflavin T. is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder after Alzheimer's disease. Clinical symptoms of PD (tremor, rigidity, and bradykinesia) are attributed to the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons from the substantia nigra. Some surviving nigral dopaminergic neurons contain cytosolic filamentous inclusions known as Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites (1Lewy F.H. Lewandowski M. Handbuch der Neurologie.

The cause of PD is unknown, but considerable evidence suggests a multifactorial etiology involving genetic susceptibility and environmental factors.

The methionine side chain is the most readily oxidized amino acid in α-synuclein, and the four methionines, Met-1, Met-5, Met-116, and Met-127, are easily oxidized in vitro in the presence of H2O2.

Yamin G. Souillac P.O. Goers J. Glaser C.B. Fink A.L. FEBS Lett. 2002; 517: 239-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Given the potential role of metals in the pathological aggregation of α-synuclein and the known strong coordination of some metals to sulfoxides, we decided to investigate the structural and fibrillation properties of Met-oxidized α-synuclein in the presence of several metals to shed more light on the combined effect of environmental factors (metals) and oxidative damage (methionine oxidation to the sulfoxide) on α-synuclein. Expression and Purification of Human α-Synuclein—Human recombinant α-synuclein was expressed in the Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cell line transfected with pRK172/α-synuclein wild-type plasmid (kind gift of M. Goedert, MRC Cambridge) and purified as described previously (33Uversky V.N. Yamin G. Souillac P.O. Goers J. Glaser C.B. Fink A.L. FEBS Lett. 2002; 517: 239-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Purity of the α-synuclein was determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, UV absorbance spectroscopy, and mass spectrometry. Supplies and Chemicals—Thioflavin T (ThT) was obtained from Sigma. ZnSO4 and CaCl2 (analytical grade) were from Fisher. Analytical grade Ti2(SO4)3, CuCl2, and Hg(CH3CO2)2 were from Aldrich, whereas AlCl3 and PbO2 were from Mallinckrodt Chemical Works and Matheson Coleman & Bell, respectively. All other chemicals were of analytical grade from Fisher. All buffers and solutions were prepared with nanopure water and stored in plastic vials. Oxidation of α-Synuclein by Hydrogen Peroxide—Oxidation of α-synuclein by H2O2 was performed as described previously (33Uversky V.N. Yamin G. Souillac P.O. Goers J. Glaser C.B. Fink A.L. FEBS Lett. 2002; 517: 239-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Circular Dichroism (CD) Measurements—CD spectra were recorded on an AVIV 60DS spectrophotometer (Lakewood, NJ) using α-synuclein concentrations of 1.0 mg/ml and a 0.1-mm path length cell. Spectra were recorded from 250–190 nm with a step size of 1.0 nm, with a bandwidth of 1.5 nm and an averaging time of 10 s. For all spectra, an average of five scans was obtained. CD spectra of the appropriate buffers were recorded and subtracted from the protein spectra. Electron Microscopy—Transmission electron micrographs were collected using a JEOL JEM-100B microscope operating with an accelerating voltage of 80 kV. Typical nominal magnifications were ×75,000. Samples were deposited on Formavar-coated 300-mesh copper grids and negatively stained with 1% aqueous uranyl acetate. Fibril Formation Assay—Fibril formation of oxidized and non-oxidized α-synuclein in the presence of various metals was monitored using the ThT assay in a fluorescence plate reader (Fluoroskan Ascent) as described previously (33Uversky V.N. Yamin G. Souillac P.O. Goers J. Glaser C.B. Fink A.L. FEBS Lett. 2002; 517: 239-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Standard conditions were 35 μm α-synuclein, pH 7.5, 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, 37 °C, with agitation. ThT fluorescence was excited at 450 nm, and the emission wavelength was 482 nm. Estimation of Hydrodynamic Dimensions—Dynamic light scattering was used to determine the Stokes radii with a DynaPro Molecular Sizing Instrument (Protein Solutions, Lakewood, NJ) using a 1.5-mm path length 12-μl quartz cuvette. Prior to measurement, solutions were filtered with a 0.1-μm Whatman Anodisc-13 filter. The Effect of Methionine Oxidation and Metal Binding on α-Synuclein Conformation—We first examined the effect of methionine oxidation on the conformation of α-synuclein and then the effects of selected metals on the conformation of unmodified and Met-oxidized α-synuclein. Fig. 1 compares far-UV CD spectra measured for the non-oxidized (Fig. 1A) and Metoxidized (Fig. 1B) forms of human α-synuclein in the absence or presence of several polyvalent cations. The spectra show that oxidized α-synuclein is slightly more unfolded than non-oxidized α-synuclein in the absence of cations. This is manifested by a small increase in negative ellipticity in the vicinity of 198 nm and somewhat lower intensity in the vicinity of 222 nm. This increased degree of disorder has been attributed to the decreased hydrophobicity of the oxidized methionines, leading to a decrease in the overall hydrophobicity of the protein (33Uversky V.N. Yamin G. Souillac P.O. Goers J. Glaser C.B. Fink A.L. FEBS Lett. 2002; 517: 239-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Previously, we demonstrated that the interaction of metal cations with natively unfolded α-synuclein induced a partially folded conformation (21Uversky V.N. Li J. Fink A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44284-44296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (926) Google Scholar). This transition was attributed to the counter ion-induced neutralization of the coulombic charge-charge repulsion within the very negatively charged protein at neutral pH (21Uversky V.N. Li J. Fink A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44284-44296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (926) Google Scholar). In agreement with this observation, Fig. 1 shows that in the presence of metals, definite changes occur in the far-UV CD spectra of both non-oxidized and oxidized forms of α-synuclein. In particular, a decrease in the minimum at 196 nm was accompanied by an increase in negative intensity around 222 nm, reflecting metal binding-induced formation of secondary structure (Fig. 1). Significantly, Fig. 1 shows that binding of the metals induced comparable structural changes in both oxidized and unmodified proteins, most probably reflecting the stabilization of identical partially folded conformations. Thus, Met-oxidized α-synuclein is slightly more unfolded than non-oxidized protein, but in the presence of metal ions, it adopts a similar partially folded conformation. Our previous studies have shown that formation of such a partially folded conformation correlates with accelerated fibrillation, as is seen with the effect of metals on non-oxidized α-synuclein (21Uversky V.N. Li J. Fink A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44284-44296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (926) Google Scholar). The Effect of Metal Binding on Fibrillation of Methionine-oxidized α-Synuclein—Next, we determined the effect of the metals on the fibrillation of Met-oxidized α-synuclein. ThT is a fluorescent dye that interacts with amyloid fibrils, leading to an increase in the fluorescence intensity in the vicinity of 480 nm (34Naiki H. Higuchi K. Matsushima K. Shimada A. Chen W.H. Hosokawa M. Takeda T. Lab. Invest. 1990; 62: 768-773PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 2 compares fibrillation patterns of non-oxidized (Fig. 2A) and oxidized α-synuclein (Fig. 2B) in the absence and presence of several metal cations monitored by ThT fluorescence. Fibril formation for the non-oxidized α-synuclein at neutral pH was characterized by a typical sigmoidal curve. In agreement with earlier studies (24Uversky V.N. Li J. Bower K. Fink A.L. Neurotoxicology. 2002; 23: 527-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), the fibrillation rate increased dramatically in the presence of all metal cations investigated (Fig. 2A). The list of the previously analyzed cations (Li+, K+, Na+, Cs+, Ca2+, Co2+, Cd2+, Cu2+, Fe2+, Mg2+, Mn2+, Zn2+, Co3+, Al3+, and Fe3+) has been extended to consider the effect of Hg2+, Pb2+, and Ti3+. Interestingly, Hg2+ and Pb2+, which are of particular relevance to environment-induced Parkinsonism, are among the most effective accelerators of α-synuclein fibrillation. This underlines, once again, a potential link between heavy metal exposure, enhanced α-synuclein fibrillation, and Parkinson's disease. In contrast, there was no evidence of fibril formation by methionine-oxidized α-synuclein at neutral pH (Fig. 2B). Previously, we showed that the inhibitory effect of methionine oxidation on α-synuclein fibrillation can be eliminated under conditions of low pH, due to the formation of a partially folded intermediate reflecting protonation of the carboxylate groups (33Uversky V.N. Yamin G. Souillac P.O. Goers J. Glaser C.B. Fink A.L. FEBS Lett. 2002; 517: 239-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). In view of this observation, and the observation that metal cations induce partial folding of oxidized α-synuclein (Fig. 1), one might expect that fibrillation of the methionine-oxidized protein would occur in the presence of metals. In accord with this hypothesis, methionine-oxidized α-synuclein readily formed fibrils in the presence of certain metal ions, such as Ti3+, Al3+, Zn2+, and Pb2+ (Fig. 2B and Table I). However, not all metals were able to accelerate the fibrillation of methionine-oxidized α-synuclein: for example, Hg2+, Cu2+, and Ca2+, although able to induce the partially folded conformation in the oxidized protein, did not induce its fibril formation (at least not within the time scale examined). Moreover, Fig. 2 and Table I show that in the presence of Zn2+ and Pb2+, fibrillation of the oxidized α-synuclein was as accelerated as for the non-oxidized protein, whereas Al3+ and Ti3+ showed a less pronounced effect. The morphology of the fibrillar material formed by the non-oxidized and oxidized α-synuclein in the presence of several metal cations was analyzed by transmission electron microscopy, and both forms of α-synuclein formed typical amyloid fibrils, as shown in Fig. 3.Table IThe effect of metal cations on the fibrillation of methionine-oxidized α-synucleinConditionsNon-oxidized α-synucleinOxidized α-synucleinLag timeKappt½Lag timeKappt½hh-1hhh-1hControlaAll solutions contained 50 mm NaCl.18.80.05455.7>200NDbND, not determined.0.1 mm Ti2(SO4)311.10.09232.874.80.08199.65 mm ZnSO41.50.2210.52.20.289.45 mm PbO20.30.464.60.90.415.85 mm Hg(CH3CO2)23.60.1715.2>200NDND5 mm CuCl212.50.1328.1>200NDND5 mm CaCl221.30.09542.2>200NDND5 mm AlCl310.20.2318.824.60.1736.3a All solutions contained 50 mm NaCl.b ND, not determined. Open table in a new tab Dynamic Light Scattering Experiments to Monitor Hydrodynamic Size—There are a number of possible mechanisms whereby methionine oxidation could inhibit α-synuclein fibrillation. One of these would be through stabilization of off-pathway oligomers, and another would be through the capping nascent fibrils. To investigate these possibilities, we monitored the association state of Met-oxidized α-synuclein during its incubation, in the absence and presence of metal ions, using dynamic light scattering (Fig. 4). Given the nature of the experimental measurements, populations of oligomers of less than 5–10% are not considered significant. Since the data shown in Fig. 4 are only for soluble protein, the total concentrations may be different in the different panels of the figure. Met-oxidized α-synuclein remained monomeric for >100 h under standard incubation conditions (35 μm α-synuclein, pH 7.5, 37 °C, with agitation), as shown in Fig. 4D, indicating that neither oligomers nor fibrils were formed in statistically significant amounts. In contrast, unmodified α-synuclein remained predominantly monomeric for the first 20 h (corresponding to the lag time) but then showed dimers and higher oligomers at longer times (in addition to fibrils), as shown in Fig. 4A. Thus, the conversion of methionine to its sulfoxide must, in some way, prevent formation of the critical partially folded intermediate conformation and subsequent association into fibrils. In the presence of Zn2+, which leads to fibril formation from the Met-oxidized α-synuclein, the monomer is the only species initially present. However, at later times, in addition to fibrils, soluble oligomers were detected, amounting to as much as 30% of the total protein and having an R s of ∼40 nm, similar to the size of the oligomers observed with the unmodified protein. In contrast, in the presence of Ca2+, which does not lead to fibrils with Met-oxidized α-synuclein, only the monomer was detected during the incubation. Since these two metals reflect the observed behavior of the two types of metal ion-induced effects in the other properties investigated, their behavior is considered representative of other metal ions. Oxidative stress is believed to be a factor in the etiology of Parkinson's disease, and the methionine residues of α-synuclein are the most easily oxidized side chains in the protein. Therefore, our previous discovery that methionine-oxidized α-synuclein, which is expected to represent one of the most common products of oxidative damage to α-synuclein, fails to form fibrils and inhibits fibrillation of unmodified α-synuclein was rather surprising, although oxidation of the single methionine residue in Aβ has also been shown to attenuate fibrillation of Aβ (35Butterfield D.A. Kanski J. Peptides (Elmsford). 2002; 23: 1299-1309Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Previously, we have shown that formation of a partially folded intermediate is a critical initial step of the α-synuclein fibrillogenesis (11Uversky V.N. Li J. Fink A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10737-10744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (936) Google Scholar) and that α-synuclein fibrillation is accelerated under conditions that stabilize such an intermediate state, e.g. at acidic pH or high temperature (11Uversky V.N. Li J. Fink A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10737-10744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (936) Google Scholar, 36Uversky V.N. Lee H.J. Li J. Fink A.L. Lee S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43495-43498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) or in the presence of metal cations (21Uversky V.N. Li J. Fink A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44284-44296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (926) Google Scholar). A contributing factor to the inhibition of methionine-oxidized α-synuclein fibrillation is believed to be the slightly increased stabilization of the natively unfolded conformation (33Uversky V.N. Yamin G. Souillac P.O. Goers J. Glaser C.B. Fink A.L. FEBS Lett. 2002; 517: 239-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). The data presented here are consistent with the conclusion that interaction of methionine-oxidized α-synuclein with certain metals modulates its conformational properties and propensity for fibrillation. Whereas all the metals studied are able to induce partial folding in this intrinsically unstructured (natively unfolded) protein, not all cations are equal in their abilities to eliminate the inhibitory effect of methionine oxidation on α-synuclein fibrillation. In particular, the fibrillation rates were very close for oxidized and non-oxidized α-synuclein in the presence of Zn2+ and Pb2+; however, fibrillation was still inhibited in the presence of Hg2+, Cu2+, and Ca2+. This observation indicates that factors other than electrostatic interactions must play an important role in overcoming the inhibition of α-synuclein fibrillation caused by methionine oxidation. One such factor is undoubtedly the known propensity for certain metals to strongly coordinate with sulfoxides, leading to very stable complexes (37Cotton F.A. Francis R. J. Amer. Chem. Soc. 1960; 82: 2986-2991Crossref Scopus (296) Google Scholar). In particular, for some metal ions, bridging between two sulfoxides is favored. Such intermolecular or intramolecular coordination of two (or more) methionine sulfoxides could significantly affect the fibrillation. In particular, we propose that stable intermolecular bridging metal complexes would significantly promote fibrillation: thus, the presence of Zn2+ or Pb2+ leads to intermolecular cross-bridging, which facilitates the association of Met-oxidized α-synuclein and leads to its subsequent fibrillation. Metals such as Hg2+ and Cu2+, which may also form sulfoxide bridges, may be limited to intramolecular coordination due to different ligand bonding. The results show that in those conditions where fibrillation occurs, large soluble oligomers are present at the latter stages of the lag time and during the fibril growth stage of the aggregation process. With regard to the biological relevance of these observations, it is becoming clear that many factors can affect the rate of α-synuclein fibrillation, suggesting that in dopaminergic neurons, there is a balance between factors that can accelerate fibrillation and those that inhibit or prevent it. It is likely that there are chaperones or chaperone-like species that are important in minimizing α-synuclein aggregation under normal conditions. In our earlier study, showing that the addition of Met-oxidized α-synuclein inhibited fibrillation of the non-oxidized form (33Uversky V.N. Yamin G. Souillac P.O. Goers J. Glaser C.B. Fink A.L. FEBS Lett. 2002; 517: 239-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), we suggested that the methionine residues in α-synuclein may be used by the cells as a natural scavenger of reactive oxygen species, since (a) methionine can react with essentially all of the known oxidants found in normal and pathological tissues; (b) α-synuclein is a very abundant brain protein; (c) it has recently been shown that the concentration of α-synuclein could be increased significantly as a result of the neuronal response to toxic insult (23Manning-Bog A.B. McCormack A.L. Li J. Uversky V.N. Fink A.L. Di Monte D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1641-1644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar); and (d) methionine sulfoxide residues in proteins can be cycled back to their native methionines by methionine sulfoxide reductase (38Levine R.L. Mosoni L. Berlett B.S. Stadtman E.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15036-15040Crossref PubMed Scopus (887) Google Scholar), a process that might protect other functionally essential residues from oxidative damage (39Reddy P.S. Bhagyalakshmi A. Ecotoxicol. Environ. Saf. 1994; 29: 255-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). It should be noted, however, that the efficiency of this regeneration system must take into account the finding that methionine oxidation forms the sulfoxide in two diastereoisomer forms and that stereoselective oxidation can sometimes occur, dependent on both the structural restraints in the region of the methionine molecule and on the oxidant itself (40Sharov V.S. Ferrington D.A. Squier T.C. Schoneich C. FEBS Lett. 1999; 455: 247-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Each methionine sulfoxide isomer can be reduced back to its original methionine state, provided that the corresponding complementary reductase is present and active (41Sharov V.S. Schoneich C. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 29: 986-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The balance between the protective antioxidant role of the methionine residues that is enhanced by this recycling and the protective antifibrillation effect of oxidized methionine residues in α-synuclein may fail under conditions of environmental pollution due to exposure of a person to lead, aluminum, zinc, titanium, and other metals. We assume that in the presence of the enhanced concentrations of such industrial pollutants, toxic insult-induced up-regulation of α-synuclein may no longer play a protective role; rather, it may represent a risk factor, leading to metal-triggered fibrillation of the methionine-oxidized protein."

In the gangliosidoses, gangliosides accumulate because of defective activity of the lysosomal proteins responsible for their degradation, usually resulting in a rapidly progressive neurodegenerative disease. However, the molecular mechanism(s) leading from ganglioside accumulation to neurodegeneration is not known. We now examine the effect of ganglioside GM2 accumulation in a mouse model of Sandhoff disease (one of the GM2 gangliosidoses), the Hexb–/– mouse. Microsomes from Hexb–/– mouse brain showed a significant reduction in the rate of Ca2+-uptake via the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA), which was prevented by feeding Hexb–/– mice with N-butyldeoxynojirimycin (NB-DNJ), an inhibitor of glycolipid synthesis that reduces GM2 storage. Changes in SERCA activity were not due to transcriptional regulation but rather because of a decrease in V max. Moreover, exogenously added GM2 had a similar effect on SERCA activity. The functional significance of these findings was established by the enhanced sensitivity of neurons cultured from embryonic Hexb–/– mice to cell death induced by thapsigargin, a specific SERCA inhibitor, and by the enhanced sensitivity of Hexb–/– microsomes to calcium-induced calcium release. This study suggests a mechanistic link among GM2 accumulation, reduced SERCA activity, and neuronal cell death, which may be of significance for delineating the neuropathophysiology of Sandhoff disease.

The GM2 gangliosidoses are a group of inherited metabolic disorders caused by mutations in any of three genes, the HEXA gene, resulting in Tay-Sachs disease, the HEXB gene, resulting in Sandhoff disease, and the GM2A gene, resulting in GM2 activator deficiency (1Gravel R.A.

The HEXA and HEXB genes code for the β-hexosaminidase α-and β-subunits, respectively, which dimerize to produce two forms of the enzyme, A (αβ)andB(ββ), and a minor form, S (αα). In both Tay-Sachs and Sandhoff disease (α- and β-subunit deficiency, respectively), there is a deficit of hexosaminidase A (αβ) and, as a consequence, massive accumulation of ganglioside GM2 in the brain (3Mahuran D.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1455: 105-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). As in all lysosomal storage diseases, significant clinical heterogeneity is observed, varying from infantile-onset, rapidly progressive neurological disease culminating in death before 4 years of age to late-onset, sub-acute or chronic progressive neurological disease (4Jeyakumar M.

The genotype of the mice was determined by PCR using genomic DNA extracted from mouse tails (13Sango K. Yamanaka S. Ajiki K. Takashikim A. Watabe K. Neuropathol. Appl. Neurobiol. 2002; 28: 23-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). A similar Hexb colony, maintained in the Glycobiology Institute at the University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom, was used for the studies in which Hexb–/– mice were fed with NB-DNJ. Mice were treated from weaning at 3 weeks with 1200 mg/kg/day of NB-DNJ. Lipid Analysis—GM2 levels were determined in Hexb–/– mouse brains at various ages after birth and compared with Hexb+/+ mice (11Platt F.M. Neises G.R. Reinkensmeier G. Townsend M.J. Perry V.H.

Ganglioside GM2 was identified using an authentic standard. Hexb Brain Microsomes—Hexb mice were sacrificed after 3–4 months, and their brains were removed, separated into cerebral cortex and cerebellum, rapidly frozen in liquid N2, and stored at –80 °C; in one set of experiments, microsomes were prepared from embryonic day 17 (E17) mouse cortices. Cortical microsomes (from 12–25 mice) were prepared essentially as described (16Betto R. Teresi A. Turcato F. Salviati G. Sabbadini R.A. Krown K. Glembotski C.C. Kindman L.A. Dettbarn C. Pereon Y.

Tissue was suspended at a ratio of 1:4 (w/v) in ice-cold Buffer A (0.32 m sucrose, 20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.0, containing 0.4 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, leupeptin (0.8 μg/ml), and aprotinin (1.4 trypsin inhibitory units)), and homogenized at 4 °C using eight up and down strokes of a rotating Potter-Elvehjem homogenizer. After centrifugation (700 × g av, 10 min), the resulting pellet (P1) was gently resuspended in ¼ of the original volume of Buffer A and centrifuged (700 × g av, 10 min), and the two supernatants were pooled (S1). Mitochondria were removed by centrifugation (8,000 × g av, 45 min) of S1, and the resulting supernatant (S2) was centrifuged (115,000 × g av, 90 min) to obtain a microsomal pellet (P3), which was resuspended in 0.4–0.8 ml of Buffer A. Protein was determined (17Bradford M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216412) Google Scholar), and the microsomes were subsequently flash-frozen in liquid N2. Microsomes were stored at –80 °C and used for up to several weeks after their preparation, during which time there was no change in their activity with respect to Ca2+-release and -uptake. Spectrophotometric Assay of Ca2 + -Uptake—Ca2+-Uptake was measured by a spectrophotometric assay using the Ca2+-sensitive dye, antipyrylazo III (16Betto R. Teresi A. Turcato F. Salviati G.

Mouse brain microsomes (330 μg in 8–15 μl of Buffer A) were added to 0.95 ml of 8 mm NaMOPS, pH 7.0, 40 mm KCl, 62.5 mm K2HPO4, and 250 μm antipyrylazo III in a plastic cuvette containing a magnetic stir bar, to which 1 mm MgATP, 40 μg/ml creatine phosphokinase, and 5 mm phosphocreatine, pH 7.0, were added. Ca2+-Uptake and -release were measured in a Cary spectrophotometer (Varian Australia Pty Ltd.) at 37 °C by subtracting A 790 from A 710 at 2-s intervals. The effect of exogenously added GM3, GM2, and GM1, dissolved in absolute ethanol, was tested by their addition 5 min before Ca2+-loading. The rate of Ca2+-uptake into microsomes was calculated by measuring the linear portion of the slope after addition of Ca2+. Kinetic Assay of SERCA—Ca2+-Uptake by SERCA was determined radiometrically using a rapid filtration technique (21Ji Y. Loukianov E. Periasamy M. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 269: 236-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Mouse cortical microsomes (350 μg protein) were incubated at 37 °C in 1.5 ml of Buffer B (40 mm imidazole, pH 7.0, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm NaN3, 5 mm potassium oxalate, 0.5 mm EGTA, 1 μm ruthenium red (21Ji Y.

Fabiato F. J. Physiol. (Paris). 1979; 75: 463-505PubMed Google Scholar) and software available at www.stanford.edu/~cpatton/maxc.html). Ca2+-Uptake was initiated by addition of ATP and terminated after 1, 3, and 5 s by addition of 3 ml of ice-cold washing solution (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm KCl, 1.4 mm MgCl2, and 2 mm KH2PO4) (24Wells K.M. Abercrombie R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5020-5025Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), followed by filtration through a HAWP 0.45-μm Millipore filter in a Millipore filtration device. The initial rate of Ca2+-uptake (v o) was calculated by linear regression analysis. The kinetic coefficients of Ca2+-uptake were calculated according to Equation 1 (25Cornea R.L. Autry J.M. Chen Z. Jones L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41487-41494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), using non-linear regression analysis (Origin 5.0; MicroCal Software, Inc.). ν=VmaxKCan[Cai]n+KCan(Eq. 1) In Equation 1, V max is maximum velocity, K Ca is the concentration required for half-maximal activation, and n is the equivalent of the Hill coefficient. The K ATP was obtained by Michaelis-Menten analysis. RT-PCR—Total cellular RNA was prepared from individual cortices using the TRI reagent (MRC, Cincinnati, OH) or from ∼0.5 × 106 neurons (see below) grown on 24-mm coverslips using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The RT-PCR was performed as described (26Bodennec J. Pelled D. Riebeling C. Trajkovic S. Futerman A.H. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 1814-1816Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) using the Qiagen OneStep RT-PCR kit. Primers (SERCA2a: 5′-ACTTCTTGATCCTCTACGTG and 5′-AAATGGTTTAGGAAGCGGTT, 33 cycles, annealing temperature 53 °C; SERCA2b: 5′-ACTTCTTGATCCTCTACGTG (same as SERCA2a) and 5′-AGACCAGAACATATCGCTAA, 25 cycles, annealing temperature 53 °C; glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase: 5′-TTAGCACCCCTGGCCAAGG and 5′-CTTACTCCTTGGAGGCCATG, 23 cycles, annealing temperature 50 °C) were designed using the MacMolly Tetra program (Softgene, Berlin, Germany), and conditions were adjusted to be within the linear phase of PCR. For sequencing, bands were excised from gels and purified using the QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen) and subsequently sequenced by the DNA sequencing unit of the Weizmann Institute of Science using the respective primers. SDS-PAGE and Western blotting—SDS-PAGE and Western blotting were performed as described (27Riebeling C. Forsea A.M. Raisova M. Orfanos C.E. Geilen C.C. Br. J. Cancer. 2002; 87: 366-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) using a 6% separating gel. After transfer to nitrocellulose membranes, the blot was incubated with blocking buffer (Tris-buffered saline containing 3% (w/v) non-fat dried milk, 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, and 0.1% Tween 20) for 20 min and then incubated with an anti-SERCA2 antibody at a dilution of 1/100 in blocking buffer for 2 h. Bound antibodies were detected after washing using 25 ng/ml horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-goat secondary antibodies in blocking buffer for 1 h and the SuperSignal chemiluminescent detection reagent (Pierce). Neuronal Ca2 + -Uptake—Embryos (embryonic day 17) were isolated, the hippocampi were removed, and hippocampal pyramidal neurons were cultured as described (7Pelled, D., Riebeling, C., van Echten-Deckert, G., Sandhoff, K., and Futerman, A. H. (2003) Neuropathol. Appl. Neurobiol., in pressGoogle Scholar). The dissected hippocampi were dissociated by trypsinization (0.25% w/v, for 15 min at 37 °C), and the tissue was washed in Mg2+/Ca2+-free Hanks' balanced salt solution and dissociated by repeated passage through a constricted Pasteur pipette. Neurons were maintained in Neurobasal serum-free medium containing B27 supplements and l-glutamine (28Brewer G.J. Torricelli J.R. Evege E.K. Price P.J. J. Neurosci. Res. 1993; 35: 567-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (1910) Google Scholar) (Invitrogen). For analysis of Ca2+-uptake (29Korkotian E. Schwarz A. Pelled D. Schwarzmann G. Segal M. Futerman A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21673-21678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), neurons were plated at a density of 1.1 × 106 cells per 60-mm culture dish that contained three 24-mm polylysine-coated coverslips. Coverslips were washed in Ca2+-free medium (minimal essential medium containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.3, 4 mm NaHCO3, 11 mg/ml pyruvic acid, 1 mm glutamine, and 0.6% (w/v) glucose (30Sofer A. Schwarzmann G. Futerman A.H. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 2111-2119Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)) and transferred to a new dish containing the same medium. After 25 min at 37 °C, neurons were incubated with the calcium ionophore A23187 (1 μm) (31Deber C.M. Hsu L.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 134: 731-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) for 5 min, prior to addition of 1 μCi of 45Ca2+ for 30 s at 37 °C (32Fields A. Gafni Y. Oron Y. Sarne Y. Brain Res. 1995; 687: 94-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The reaction was terminated by removing coverslips from the wells and washed by dipping five times in Ca2+-free medium and then placing in 0.65 ml of NaOH (0.5 m)for3h. 45Ca2+ was further extracted by adding NaOH for 16 h and then for another 2 h. NaOH extracts were pooled, and 45Ca2+ was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Neuronal Cell Death—Neurons were plated at a density of 25,000 cells per 13-mm coverslip in a 24-multiwell dish. Live and dead cells were distinguished using 2 μm calcein acetoxymethyl ester and 4 μm ethidium homodimer-1, respectively, as described in a Live/Dead® viability/cytotoxicity kit (Molecular Probes Inc.). At least 700–800 cells were counted per coverslip. Neurons were examined using a Plan 25×/0.45 numerical aperture objective of a Zeiss Axiovert 35 microscope. Previous studies have shown that GM2 accumulates in adult Hexb–/– mouse brains (5Sango K. Yamanaka S. Hoffmann A. Okuda Y. Grinberg A. Westphal H. McDonald M.P. Crawley J.N. Sandhoff K. Suzuki K. Proia R.L. Nat. Genet. 1995; 11: 170-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). We now examine GM2 accumulation throughout brain development. Even at the earliest age measured, embryonic day 10, small but significant levels of GM2 were detected (7.6 ± 0.4 μg/10 mg dry weight), which increased to levels of 140 ± 7 μg/10 mg dry weight in 3-month-old mice (Fig. 1A), whereas no GM2 could be detected at any stage in Hexb+/+ brains. Significant amounts of GM2 were also detected in microsomes prepared from 3–4-month-old Hexb–/– mice, but essentially no GM2 was detected in microsomes from Hexb+/+ mice (Fig. 1B). A significant decrease in GM2 accumulation (Fig. 1B) was observed in microsomes from 120-day-old Hexb–/– mice that had been fed with NB-DNJ, similar to that reported previously for whole brain (12Jeyakumar M. Butters T.D. Cortina-Borja M. Hunnam V. Proia R.L. Perry V.H. Dwek R.A. Platt F.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. (U. S. A.). 1999; 96: 6388-6393Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). We proposed recently that changes in Ca2+-homeostasis, and specifically changes in Ca2+-release from intracellular stores via the ryanodine receptor (29Korkotian E. Schwarz A. Pelled D. Schwarzmann G. Segal M. Futerman A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21673-21678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 33Lloyd-Evans E. Pelled D. Riebeling C.

Chem. 2003; 278: 23594-23599Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), may be responsible, at least in part, for the neuropathophysiology observed in neuronopathic forms of Gaucher disease, in which glucosylceramide accumulates in lysosomes. To determine whether Ca2+-homeostasis is also affected in Sandhoff disease mice, we examined Ca2+-release and -uptake in Hexb microsomes, by a spectrophotometric assay using the Ca2+-sensitive dye, antipyrylazo III. No differences were detected in the rate of agonist-induced Ca2+-release via the ryanodine or inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors, the major Ca2+-release channels in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (not shown). In contrast, the rate of Ca2+-uptake was reduced by ∼5-fold in microsomes from Hexb–/– compared with Hexb+/+ mice (Fig. 2A) and, remarkably, was almost completely normal in microsomes from Hexb–/– mice fed with NB-DNJ (Fig. 2B). These results suggest a causal relationship between GM2 levels and rates of Ca2+-uptake via SERCA. Although we cannot formally exclude the possibility that NB-DNJ by itself effects SERCA activity in vivo, there is no indication from clinical studies (34Cox T. Lachmann R. Hollak C. Aerts J. van Weely S. Hrebicek M. Platt F. Butters T. Dwek R. Moyses C. Gow I. Elstein D. Zimran A. Lancet. 2000; 355: 1481-1485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar) or from studies in cell culture (35Bieberich E. MacKinnon S. Silva J. Yu R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44396-44404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) that NB-DNJ has any effect on Ca2+-homeostasis, and moreover, no changes are observed in GM2 levels in wild type mice fed NB-DNJ (36Platt F.M. Reinkensmeier G. Dwek R.A. Butters T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19365-19372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). A causal relationship between GM2 levels and SERCA activity was supported by a similar reduction in the rate of Ca2+-uptake in Hexb+/+ microsomes incubated with exogenously added GM2 (Table I). Two other monosialogangliosides, GM3 and GM1, also reduced the rate of Ca2+-uptake but to a smaller extent than GM2 (Table I).Table IEffect of exogenously-added gangliosides on microsomal Ca 2+-uptakeGanglioside (10 μm)Rate of Ca2+-uptakenmol/s/mg proteinNone0.22 ± 0.01GM30.17 ± 0.04GM20.07 ± 0.02GM10.13 ± 0.00 Open table in a new tab To determine the mechanism by which GM2 affects SERCA activity, we analyzed the initial rate of Ca2+-uptake by a radiometric assay using a rapid filtration technique (21Ji Y. Loukianov E. Periasamy M. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 269: 236-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The V max of SERCA was 3.70 ± 0.12 nmol Ca2+/s/mg of protein in Hexb+/+ brain microsomes and 1.88 ± 0.17 nmol Ca2+/s/mg of protein in Hexb–/– microsomes, the K Ca was 0.29 ± 0.03 and 0.23 ± 0.06 μm for Hexb+/+ and Hexb–/–, respectively, with no change in the Hill coefficient (1.9 versus 2.0) (Fig. 3A), and there was a small but non-significant reduction in the K ATP (140 ± 40 μm for Hexb+/+ and 80 ± 20 μm for Hexb–/–) (Fig. 3B). Thus, GM2 affects the V max of SERCA but not its affinity toward Ca2+ or ATP. The reduction in V max was not because of transcriptional regulation of SERCA, because there were no changes in mRNA expression in brain for the SERCA2 isoforms 2Using the primers for SERCA2a, a second product was amplified (Fig. 4A). Sequencing revealed a novel SERCA2 isoform with an alternative COOH terminus, designated SERCA2c. This isoform differs from SERCA2a by 83 nucleotides (6879 to 6961; GenBank™ accession no. AJ131870 (19Ver Heyen M. Reed T.D. Blough R.I. Baker D.L. Zilberman A. Loukianov E. Van Baelen K. Raeymaekers L. Periasamy M. Wuytack F. Mamm.

Cell Calcium. 1999; 25: 277-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar)) (Fig. 4A) and no change in SERCA2 protein levels in microsomes (Fig. 4B).Fig. 4RT-PCR and Western blotting of SERCA. A, RT-PCR was performed on RNA extracted from two samples of Hexb+/+ and Hexb–/– cortices or from two cultures of hippocampal neurons; levels of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) expression are shown to demonstrate that equal amounts of RNA were used for RTPCR. One of two independent experiments is shown. B, Western blotting using an anti-SERCA antibody was performed on three different microsomal preparations from each Hexb–/– and Hexb+/+ brain (100 μg of protein) or from rat heart (20 μg of protein); note that even though SERCA2 is the predominant SERCA isoform in brain, its levels are much lower than in heart microsomes.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We next examined the functional significance of the reduced rate of Ca2+-uptake via SERCA. Hexb–/– microsomes were significantly more sensitive to calcium-induced calcium release (CICR) than Hexb+/+ microsomes or microsomes from Hexb–/– mice fed with NB-DNJ (Fig. 5, A and B), suggesting that elevated cytosolic Ca2+ levels in Hexb–/– neurons may induce CICR. In addition, thapsigargin (75 μm), a specific SERCA inhibitor (38Treiman M. Caspersen C. Christensen S.B. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1998; 19: 131-135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar), blocked Ca2+-uptake by only 50% in Hexb+/+ microsomes (compare Fig. 2B with Fig. 5C) but completely blocked SERCA activity in Hexb–/– microsomes (Fig. 5, C and D), an effect that was again prevented in Hexb–/– microsomes from NB-DNJ-fed mice. To determine whether the enhanced sensitivity to thapsigargin might be of functional significance for neuronal viability, we examined the effect of thapsigargin on neurons cultured from E17 Hexb mice. No changes in mRNA expression of SERCA2 was detected in hippocampal neurons (Fig. 4A). Even in neurons from these young mice, a significant reduction in the rate of Ca2+-uptake into the ER of live neurons was observed (Fig. 6A), and the rate of Ca2+-uptake into E17 microsomes was also decreased by ∼50% (Fig. 6B). Note that the specific activity of SERCA in embryonic microsomes was ∼50-fold lower than in adult microsomes (compare Fig. 2B with Fig. 6B), implying that the small but significant amounts of GM2 that accumulate in E17 brain (Fig. 1), and in cultured neurons from E17 embryos (7Pelled, D., Riebeling, C., van Echten-Deckert, G., Sandhoff, K., and Futerman, A. H. (2003) Neuropathol. Appl. Neurobiol., in pressGoogle Scholar), is sufficient to account for the reduction in SERCA activity. Intriguingly, neurons cultured from Hexb–/– mice were more sensitive to thapsigargin-induced neuronal cell death than Hexb+/+ neurons, supporting our contention that changes in cytosolic Ca2+ levels resulting from inhibition of SERCA activity by GM2 may be involved in the molecular mechanism(s) causing neuronal pathophysiology in Sandhoff disease.Fig. 6Ca2+-Uptake in embryonic hippocampal neurons. A, 45Ca2+-uptake into 7-day-old neurons cultured from E17 Hexb+/+ and Hexb–/– mice. Results are means ± S.D. from three independent neuronal cultures in which 45Ca2+-uptake was measured on six individual coverslips. B, the mean rate of Ca2+-uptake (n = 3 or 4 ± S.D.) was determined in cortical microsomes from E17 Hexb+/+ and Hexb–/– mice. Results are means ± S.D. for three independent measurements. C, 4-day-old neurons cultured from E17 Hexb+/+ (squares) or Hexb–/– (circles) mice were incubated with thapsigargin for 1 h, and cell death was quantified using the Live/Dead® kit. Results are means ± S.D. for three independent cultures in which four coverslips were analyzed for each thapsigargin concentration.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The major finding of the current study is that ganglioside GM2, upon its accumulation in neuronal tissues from Hexb–/– mice, affects the rate of Ca2+-uptake into brain microsomes and into the ER of live neurons, because of a decrease in the V max of SERCA. As a result, neurons are more sensitive to thapsigargin-induced neuronal cell death, implying that altered Ca2+-uptake may be of physiological relevance for understanding the etiology of Sandhoff disease. The main functions of SERCA in skeletal and smooth muscle (37Misquitta C.M. Mack D.P. Grover A.K. Cell Calcium. 1999; 25: 277-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) are to prevent prolonged elevation of cytosolic Ca2+ and to maintain Ca2+ levels within the ER (39MacLennan D.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 5291-5297Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Modification of SERCA activity normally has deleterious effects (40Frank K.F. Bolck B. Brixius K. Kranias E.G. Schwinger R.H. Basic Res. Cardiol. 2002; 97: 172-178Crossref Google Scholar). Less is known about the regulation of SERCA activity in brain, where it occurs at much lower levels than in muscle (41East J.M. Mol. Membr. Biol. 2000; 17: 189-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), but a number of studies, mainly using thapsigargin, have shown that SERCA plays a crucial role in neuronal function. For instance, exposure of neurons and neuronal cell lines to thapsigargin results in ER stress (42Paschen W. Mengesdorf T. Althausen S. Hotop S. J.

Neurol. 2002; 178: 21-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Two previous studies have demonstrated that exogenously added gangliosides modulate SERCA activity in rabbit sarcoplasmic reticulum (46Wang L.H. Tu Y.P. Yang X.Y. Tsui Z.C. Yang F.Y.

FEBS Lett. 1999; 457: 144-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), but ours is the first to show a direct physiological link between endogenous ganglioside accumulation and neuronal cell death mediated via SERCA. In the previous studies, GM1 inhibited rabbit sarcoplasmic reticulum SERCA whereas GM3 activated SERCA (47Wang Y. Tsui Z. Yang F. FEBS Lett. 1999; 457: 144-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) via a mechanism that was proposed to involve the compactness of the hydrophilic and hydrophobic domains. In our study on mouse brain SERCA, GM1 and GM3 both inhibited SERCA, although exogenously added GM3 had a slight stimulatory effect at higher concentrations (i.e. 50 μm) (not shown). Irrespective of the effects of GM3 and GM1, our data unambiguously demonstrate that GM2 has a potent inhibitory effect on SERCA activity and that neurons that accumulate endogenous GM2 are more sensitive to thapsigargin-induced neuronal cell death via a pathway that may be amplified in neurons by their enhanced sensitivity to CICR. We demonstrated previously (7Pelled, D., Riebeling, C., van Echten-Deckert, G., Sandhoff, K., and Futerman, A. H. (2003) Neuropathol. Appl. Neurobiol., in pressGoogle Scholar) that endogenous GM2 accumulation in Hexb–/– neurons results in reduced rates of axonal and dendritic growth but no changes in viability under non-stress conditions. Interestingly, an inverse relationship exists between cytosolic Ca2+ levels and rates of axon out-growth (48Tang F. Dent E.W. Kalil K. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 927-936Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting a mechanistic link among GM2 accumulation, SERCA activity, cytosolic Ca2+, and axonal out-growth. Clearly, modulation of SERCA activity, either directly or indirectly by GM2, is the critical step in this pathway, and a crucial question concerns whether the intracellular GM2 that accumulates in Hexb–/– brains is accessible to SERCA in neurons, because gangliosides are not normally considered to reside in the ER, as they are synthesized distal to the ER in the Golgi apparatus. Our observation that GM2 is readily detectable in the same microsomes used to analyze SERCA activity lends support to the possibility that SERCA could be directly modulated by GM2. It should be noted that other gangliosides affect intracellular organelles other than those in which they reside or are degraded. For instance, ganglioside GD3 traffics to mitochondria where it affects mitochondrial function (49Garcia-Ruiz C. Colell A. Morales A. Calvo M. Enrich C. Fernandez-Checa J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36443-36448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). To date, no molecular mechanism has been provided to explain the neuropathophysiology in Sandhoff disease. Microglial activation precedes acute neurodegeneration in Hexb–/– mice, with elevation of various genes related to a macrophage-mediated inflammatory response (50Wada R. Tifft C.J. Proia R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. (U. S. A.). 2000; 97: 10954-10959Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar, 51Myerowitz R. Lawson D. Mizukami H. Mi Y. Tifft C.J. Proia R.L. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 1343-1350Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), although the initiating signal for microglial activation is not known. Our data suggest that a downstream response to changes in cytosolic Ca2+ levels might initiate a stress response (52Wyss-Coray T. Mucke L. Neuron. 2002; 35: 419-432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (990) Google Scholar), which may subsequently act as an initiating signal for the neuroinflammatory response. Interestingly, the inflammatory response pre-dates symptom onset in Hexb–/– mice (53Jeyakumar M. Thomas R. Elliot-Smith E. Smith D.A. van der Spoel A.C. d'Azzo A. Perry V.H. Butters T.D. Dwek R.A. Platt F.M. Brain. 2003; 126: 974-987Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar), and changes in SERCA activity can be detected in mice as young as embryonic day 17, even though no symptoms of Sandhoff disease are observed until 2–3 months of age. Moreover, the ability of NB-DNJ to prevent the reduction of SERCA activity, because of a decrease in storage levels of GM2, together with the delayed symptom onset of these mice (12Jeyakumar M. Butters T.D. Cortina-Borja M. Hunnam V. Proia R.L. Perry V.H. Dwek R.A. Platt F.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. (U. S. A.). 1999; 96: 6388-6393Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar), implies a direct correlation between the initiation of neuronal cell dysfunction and/or death and modulation of SERCA activity by GM2.

https://openalex.org/W2123474600,"To find a novel human ion channel gene we have executed an extensive search by using a human genome draft sequencing data base. Here we report a novel two-pore domain K+ channel, TRESK (TWIK-related spinal cord K+ channel). TRESK is coded by 385 amino acids and shows low homology (19%) with previously characterized two-pore domain K+ channels. However, the most similar channel is TREK-2 (two-pore domain K+ channel), and TRESK also has two pore-forming domains and four transmembrane domains that are evolutionarily conserved in the two-pore domain K+ channel family. Moreover, we confirmed that TRESK is expressed in the spinal cord. Electrophysiological analysis demonstrated that TRESK induced outward rectification and functioned as a background K+ channel. Pharmacological analysis showed TRESK to be inhibited by previously reported K+ channel inhibitors Ba2+, propafenone, glyburide, lidocaine, quinine, quinidine, and triethanolamine. Functional analysis demonstrated TRESK to be inhibited by unsaturated free fatty acids such as arachidonic acid and docosahexaenoic acid. TRESK is also sensitive to extreme changes in extracellular and intracellular pH. These results indicate that TRESK is a novel two-pore domain K+ channel that may set the resting membrane potential of cells in the spinal cord.

The potassium (K+) channel was first identified and characterized as Drosophila Shaker. It is activated by a change in membrane potential and induces selective permeation of K+ (1Papazian D.M.

Nature. 1988; 331: 143-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). To date, more than 70 K+ channel genes have been identified in mammals and are divided into several subfamilies on the basis of their sequence similarities and channel properties (4Butler A. Wei A.G. Baker K. Salkoff L. Science. 1989; 243: 943-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). The K+ channels are characterized by having two, four, or six transmembrane domains and one or two pore-forming domains that are essential for selective permeation of K+. It was reported that the K+ channel is present in all living cells and organs and is involved in a variety of cellular functions, including regulation of the neuronal firing rate, heart rate, muscle contraction, and hormone secretion (5Rudy B. Neuroscience. 1988; 25: 729-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (1070) Google Scholar, 6Hille B. Ionic Channels of Excitable Membranes. Sinauer Associates, Inc., Sunderland, MA1992Google Scholar).The most recently identified K+ channels were two-pore domain K+ channels, which have four transmembrane domains (TM1–4), two pore-forming domains (P1, P2), cytoplasmic N- and C-terminal regions, and an extended extracellular loop between TM1 and P1, which are evolutionarily conserved (7Lesage F. Lazdunski M. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2000; 279: 793-801Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Especially, the pore-forming domain has a consensus amino acid motif of TXG(Y/F)G. In mammals the first gene identified as coding for the two-pore domain K+ channel was named TWIK-1, and to date 14 genes have been isolated as members of the subfamily (8Lesage F. Guillemare E.

However, it is not clear whether these sensitivities are involved in cellular function.The human genome project was completed in 2001, and the genome sequence is now open to the public (29Lander E.S. Linton L.M. Birren B. Nusbaum C. Zody M.C. et al.Nature. 2001; 409: 860-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (17490) Google Scholar, 30Venter J.C. Adams M.D. Myers E.W. Li P.W. Mural R.J. et al.Science. 2001; 291: 1304-1351Crossref PubMed Scopus (10466) Google Scholar). As a result, many genes whose existence had not previously been reported have now been isolated by using the human draft sequencing data base. Many channel genes have been isolated and analyzed for their cellular mechanisms. This has been especially true for two-pore domain K+ channel genes. In this paper we describe the cloning of a novel two-pore domain K+ channel, TRESK, from the human draft sequencing data base and describe its tissue distribution and electrophysiological and pharmacological properties.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMolecular Cloning and Isolation of TRESK—The human TWIK-1 amino acid sequence was used for a TBLASTN search against the human draft genome sequencing data base at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). The genomic clone (GenBank™ accession number AL731557) was identified, and some fragments of AL731557 showed the highest similarity to human TREK2. To identify the 5′- and 3′-ends of the cDNA corresponding to this fragment, 5′ and 3′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends was performed with human spinal cord poly(A)+ RNA using a Marathon cDNA amplification kit (Clontech) and primers derived from the genomic fragment. Amplified fragments were directly cloned into the plasmid pCR-TOPO (Invitrogen) and sequenced on both strands (Applied Biosystems, model 3700). Sequencing of the rapid amplification of cDNA end products revealed that this genomic fragment was a part of a cDNA. The determined sequences were assembled into one contiguous sequence with an open-reading frame encoding 385 amino acids. This is called human TRESK.Finally, to verify that human TRESK cDNA including the entire open-reading frame could be cloned from an independent source, human spinal cord poly(A)+ RNA (Clontech) was used for the reverse transcription (RT) 1The abbreviations used are: RT, reverse transcription; TM, transmembrane domain.-PCR. The RT reaction was primed with random hexamer. The primers for PCR were 5′-TCAGGGACGATGGAGGTCT-3′ and 5′-AAAACCAGCTCAGCCAGTG-3′. PCR was performed for 35 cycles at 98 °C for 15 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 2 min with Taq polymerase (TAKARA). The amplified fragment was subcloned into pCR-TOPO vector sequenced on both strands.RT-PCR Analysis—Multiple human poly(A)+ RNA (Clontech) was reverse-transcribed to generate first-strand cDNA with an Advantage RT-for-PCR kit (Clontech). PCR was carried out with this first-strand cDNA, corresponding to 5 ng of poly(A)+ RNA. PCR primers were designed from the human TRESK cDNA sequence, 5′-TGCTTTCTGGTGACCTACGC-3′ and 5′-GCTGCACAGGAAATGTAGGC-3′. PCR was performed for 45 cycles at 98 °C for 15 s and 70 °C for 1 min using Taq polymerase. The PCR products were run on 1.5% polyacrylamide gels. Ethidium bromide-stained gels were examined under UV illumination. Amplified fragments were subcloned into the pCR-TOPO vector and sequenced on both strands to confirm the PCR product as human TRESK. As a control, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was amplified using specific primers (Clontech).Transfection of TRESK—The previously amplified cDNA of TRESK was cloned into the pcDNA3.1 vector (Invitrogen). L929 cells were transfected with TRESK cDNA for electrophysiological studies as described elsewhere (31Miyake A. Mochizuki S. Yokoi H. Kohda M. Furuichi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25018-25025Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 32Mochizuki S. Miyake A. Furuichi K.

Science. 2001; 293: 1327-1330Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). Cells were co-transfected with the TRESK expression vector described previously and the green fluorescent protein expression vector phGFP S65T (Clontech) using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science). The cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Transfected cells were identified by observing green fluorescent protein fluorescence with an epifluorescence microscope. Electrophysiological studies were carried out 1–3 days after transfection.Electrophysiological Study—Electrophysiological recordings of TRESK transfectants were performed using a voltage-clamp technique (34Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.J. Pflügers Arch. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15093) Google Scholar). Recordings were made with an Axopatch 1D amplifier (Axon Instruments) using patch electrodes with a resistance of 3–5 megaohms. The internal pipette solution contained 149 mm KCl, 1.8 mm MgCl2, 4.5 mm EGTA, and 9 mm HEPES-K (pH 7.3). The external solution contained 149 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm HEPES-Na (pH 7.3). For the inside-out patch experiments, both the pipette and bath solutions contained 150 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm HEPES-K (pH 7.3). All recordings were performed at room temperature (22 °C). Analysis was carried out on a personal computer using pCLAMP6 software (Axon Instruments). All values are expressed as means ± S.E. Statistical significance was tested with Student's t test.RESULTSMolecular Cloning of Human TRESK—The two-pore domain K+ channel-related sequence, accession number AL731557, was identified in the human draft genome sequencing data base of GenBank™ using a TBLASTN search for the amino acid sequence of human TWIK-1. Genomic clone AL731557 has a region encoding an amino acid sequence having the highest similarity to human TREK-2. As described under “Experimental Procedures,” a series of rapid amplification of cDNA end studies using primers designed from this region resulted in identification of a full-length coding sequence (CDS) (1158 bases) with an open-reading frame encoding 385 amino acids (Fig. 1A). Because this new clone is included in human genomic clone AL731557, consists of 142,068 bases, and has been assigned to chromosome 10 of the human genome, we performed sequence alignment with the CDS and AL731557. The alignment revealed that the CDS consisted of 3 exons composed of 222, 129, and 804 bases and two introns spanning 12,811 bases. Hydrophobicity analysis of the amino acid sequence showed that the new clone belongs to the K+ channel family since it has two pore-forming domains (P) and four transmembrane domains (TM) (Fig. 1, A and B). Two N-glycosylation sites are present in the TM1-P1 linker region (Fig. 1, A and C). Because the N-terminal region is located on the intracellular side, similar to other two-pore domain K+ channels, the putative K+ channel has a short N-terminal region, extended intracellular loop between TM2 and TM3, and a short C-terminal region (Fig. 1C).Searching the GenBank™ data base with the BLAST sequence alignment program revealed that the full amino acid sequence of the new clone shows the greatest similarity to human TREK2, but even so, it still shares only 34% identity. Alignment of the amino acid sequence of the new clone with other two-pore domain K+ channels shows low homology, 13.5–19.7%. Also, phylogenetic analysis suggested that this clone has a common ancestor with previously reported two-pore domain K+ channels but represents an additional branch in this family of the channels (Fig. 2). These results indicate that this new clone is a novel two-pore domain K+ channel that is included in a novel subfamily. Thus, we named this new clone the TWIK-related spinal cord K+ channel, TRESK.Fig. 2Phylogenetic tree of the human two-pore domain K + channel family, including TRESK. The tree was generated using the neighbor-joining algorithm of the Phylip program on the basis of a multiple alignment of conserved sequences of the pore-forming domain analyzed with the ClustalW program.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Tissue Distribution of TRESK—To determine the tissue distribution of TRESK in humans, RT-PCR analysis was carried out using a specific primer set, one primer from the first exon and the other from the third exon of TRESK, with human multiple tissue poly(A)+ RNA. The expected 800-bp PCR product of TRESK, confirmed by sequencing, was amplified only in the spinal cord (Fig. 3). To be sure of this result, we repeated the same experiment with another specific primer set, one primer from the first exon and the other from the third exon of TRESK, and another set of human multiple tissue poly(A)+ RNA. Again, the expected PCR product was amplified only in the spinal cord (data not shown). Northern blot analysis was performed using human multiple tissue blots (MTN Blots, Clontech), but no specific signal was detected in the 23 tissues (brain, heart, skeletal muscle, colon, thymus, spleen, kidney, liver, small intestine, placenta, lung, peripheral blood leukocytes, adrenal gland, bladder, bone marrow, lymph node, mammary gland, prostate, spinal cord, stomach, thyroid, trachea, and uterus) (data not shown). The reason is thought to be that the TRESK transcript level is very low and/or expressed in a specific region of the spinal cord.Fig. 3Tissue distribution of TRESK. Human poly(A)+ RNA (5 ng) from each tissue was reverse-transcribed with a random primer and amplified by PCR for TRESK. In this study, an 800-bp PCR product was amplified only in the spinal cord (upper). Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was tested as a positive control of the RT-PCR (lower).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Basic Electrophysiological Properties of TRESK—To characterize the electrophysiological properties of TRESK using the whole-cell voltage clamp technique, L929 cells were transiently transfected with the TRESK expression vector. The cells were clamped at a holding potential of –80 mV and were depolarized to voltages between –120 and +100 mV. In TRESK-transfected cells, large currents were recorded (Fig. 4A) that were not present in the control cells (data not shown). The activation kinetics of TRESK current was rapid. Depolarization steps induced a two-step current composed of large instantaneous and delayed components (Fig. 4A). The ion selectivity of TRESK was studied by changing the concentration of K+ in the external solution from 5 to 150 mm while maintaining the pipette [K+] constant at 150 mm. The current-voltage (I-V) relationship is outwardly rectifying, and almost no inward currents were recorded in an external medium containing 5 mm K+ (Fig. 4B). The plots of the reversal potential as a function of [K+] showed that the slope was 49.0 ± 0.8 mV/decade (n = 3), which is close to the calculated Nernst value of 58 mV, as expected for a highly selective K+ channel (Fig. 4C). As previously reported for other two-pore domain K+ channels, the membrane potential of TRESK-expressed L929 cells with a high current density was strongly polarized (Fig. 4D). In contrast, the membrane potential of TRESK-expressed cells that had a low current density was not polarized (Fig. 4D).Fig. 4Electrophysiological studies of TRESK. A, voltage-dependent outward currents in L929 cells transfected with TRESK cDNA (upper traces). Cells were held at –80 mV and depolarized to a voltage between –120 and +100 mV (lower traces). B, the current-voltage (I-V) relationship plotted at different [K+]. C, reversal potential of TRESK currents as a function of [K+]out. Experimental values were fit by linear regression (slope, 49 mV/decade).

The classical K+ channel blocker, Ba2+, applied extracellularly at 3 mm inhibited TRESK current. This inhibition was gradually released by depolarization to voltages from –20 to +80 mV (Fig. 5A). To clarify the inhibition by Ba2+, we tested the effect of Ba2+ at the start and end of pulses at different voltages. The inhibition by Ba2+ at the end of the pulse was significantly decreased at depolarized potentials. On the other hand, the inhibition at the start of the pulse was not affected by the depolarization (Fig. 5B). These results suggest that Ba2+ acts as an open channel blocker. TRESK was insensitive to 4-aminopyridine (non-selective K+ channel blocker), paxilline, penitrem A (Ca2+-activated K+ channel blocker), tolazamide, and glipizide (ATP-sensitive K+ channel blocker) when applied extracellularly at 100 μm. Propafenone, glyburide (ATP-sensitive K+ channel blocker), lidocaine (Na+ channel blocker), quinine, quinidine, and triethanolamine (non-selective K+ channel blocker) inhibited TRESK currents by 95.3 ± 1.8% (n = 3), 76.8 ± 8.6% (n = 4), 75.7 ± 5.4% (n = 5), 75.2 ± 7.1% (n = 4), 90.6 ± 1.5% (n = 4), and 34.4 ± 1.0% (n = 3), respectively (Fig. 5C). Because these compounds were reported to inhibit K+ channels, the results suggest that TRESK has the property of K+ channels.Fig. 5Pharmacological properties of TRESK. A, the addition of 3 mm Ba2+ to the bath solution reversibly reduced the TRESK current. Cells were held at –80 mV and depolarized to a voltage between –120 and +100 mV. B, inhibition of TRESK currents by 3 mm Ba2+ at the start and end of pulses at different voltages. Cells were held at –80 mV and depolarized to a voltage between –20 and +80 mV. C, inhibition by various K+ channel inhibitors, 50 μm propafenone, 50 μm glyburide, 1 mm lidocaine, 0.1 mm quinine, 0.1 mm quinidine, and 2 mm triethanolamine (TEA), of TRESK currents elicited by 0 mV pulse.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Inhibition of TRESK by Free Fatty Acids—Outside-out patches were used to test whether TRESK is sensitive to free fatty acids. Arachidonic acid, which is a polyunsaturated free fatty acid, inhibited TRESK current when applied to the extracellular side of outside-out patches (Fig. 6A). We also tested whether arachidonic acid could inhibit TRESK from the cytoplasmic side of the membrane. In inside-out patches, intracellular application of arachidonic acid inhibits TRESK current (Fig. 6B). This inhibition was expressed in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 6C). The onset of inhibition was generally rapid (within 1 min), and steady-state inhibition was observed within 1 min after application. The relative channel current was plotted as a function of the arachidonic acid concentration in Fig. 6D. With the reasonable assumption that 50 μm arachidonic acid produces maximal inhibition of TRESK, the averaged data were fit to a Hill equation of the form y = 1/(1 + (K 1/2/[arachidonic acid])n), where K 1/2 is the apparent concentration of arachidonic acid that produces half-maximal inhibition, and n is the Hill coefficient (apparent K 1/2 = 6.6 μm, Hill coefficient = 1.3, n = 3). We tested whether other free fatty acids, i.e. saturated and unsaturated free fatty acids, were also able to inhibit TRESK current. When applied to the intracellular side, unsaturated free fatty acids such as docosahexaenoic acid, linoleic acid, and oleatic acid significantly inhibited TRESK current at 20 μm (Fig. 6, E and F). Saturated free fatty acids such as palmitic acid and stearic acid had almost no effect on TRESK current at 20 μm (Fig. 6, E and G, n = 3 and 4, respectively). These results show that unsaturated free fatty acids inhibit TRESK current.Fig. 6Inhibition of TRESK by free fatty acids. A, inhibition of TRESK current by arachidonic acid (AA) in outside-out patches in symmetric 150 mm KCl. Arachidonic acid (50 μm) was applied to the extracellular side. Cells were held at +20 mV. The inset shows the current-voltage (I-V) relationships recorded by applying a voltage ramp from –60 to +60 mV (50 mV/s) at the response for before (a) or during (b) application of arachidonic acid. B, inhibition by arachidonic acid on TRESK current recorded at +40 mV in the inside-out patches. Arachidonic acid (20 μm) was applied to the cytoplasmic side of the membrane. C, in the inside-out patches, the concentration of arachidonic acid was increased in steps from 0 to 50 μm. D, relative channel activity plotted as a function of [arachidonic acid]. E, inhibition of the TRESK current by different free fatty acids at 20 μm (n = 3 each). DHA, docosahexaenoic acid; LA, linoleic acid; OA, oleatic acid; PA, palmitic acid; SA, stearic acid. F, inhibition by docosahexaenoic acid in inside-out patches held at +40 mV. Docosahexaenoic acid (20 μm) was applied to the cytoplasmic side of the membrane. G, application of stearic acid (20 μm) to the cytoplasmic side of the membrane in inside-out patches held at +40 mV.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Regulation of TRESK Current by pH—We tested whether TRESK is sensitive to changes in the extracellular and intracellular pH. We first used whole-cell recording to test whether TRESK is sensitive to changes in the extracellular pH. The cells were clamped at a holding potential of –40 mV and then depolarized to voltages between –80 and +80 mV. TRESK currents were measured at different extracellular pH values (Fig. 7A). Changes in the extracellular pH from 7.3 to 5.6 and 8.9 resulted in inhibition (80 ± 7%, n = 3) and enhancement (1"

In the current study, we demonstrated the involvement of apoptogenic factors in epithelial cell necrosis in response to hyperoxia, including the formation of the Fas-related death-inducing signaling complex and initiation of mitochondria-dependent apoptotic pathways. We showed increased activation of both Bid and Bax in A549 cells subjected to hyperoxia. Bax activation involved a Bid-assisted conformational change. We discovered that the response to hyperoxia in vivo predominantly involved the activation of the Bid/caspase-8 pathway without apparent increases in Bax expression. Disruption of the Bid pathway by gene deletion protected against cell death in vivo and in vitro. Likewise, inhibition of caspase-8 by Flip also protected against cell death. Taken together, we have demonstrated the involvement of apoptogenic factors in epithelial cell responses to hyperoxia, despite a final outcome of cellular necrosis. We have, for the first time, identified a predominant role for the caspase-8/Bid pathway in signaling associated with hyperoxic lung injury and cell death in vivo and in vitro.

The clinical treatment of respiratory failure often requires supplemental oxygen therapy. Unfortunately, exposure to an elevated oxygen tension (hyperoxia) may cause acute and chronic lung injury. Prolonged hyperoxia triggers an extensive inflammatory response in the lung that degrades the alveolar-capillary barrier, leading to impaired gas exchange and pulmonary edema (1Horowitz S. Davis J.M. McDonald J.A. Lung Growth and Development. Decker Press, New York1997: 577-610Google Scholar). The pathological changes in hyperoxia-injured lungs coincide with the injury or death of pulmonary capillary endothelial cells and alveolar epithelial cells, which maintain the integrity of the alveolar-capillary barrier and serve as a first-line defense against oxidative injury. Compromised epithelial cell function may permit fluid and macromolecules to leak into the airspace, resulting in clinical respiratory failure and death (2Mantell L.L. Lee P.J. Mol. Genet. Metab. 2000; 71: 359-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Epithelial cell homeostasis requires stringent control over proliferative and apoptotic pathways. Hyperoxia-induced cell death may involve apoptosis and necrosis, two distinct mechanisms of cell death with different biochemical, morphological, and functional characteristics (3Majno G. Joris I. Am. J. Pathol. 1995; 146: 3-15PubMed Google Scholar). In necrosis, an extensive cell lysis results from acute, accidental, or non-physiological injury (4Alison M.R. Sarraf C.E. Gut. 1994; 35: 577-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In contrast, apoptosis represents a regulated form of cell death that participates in tissue development and homeostasis, requiring the action of proteases and nucleases within an intact plasma membrane (5Kroemer G. Dallaporta B. Resche-Rigon M. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1998; 60: 619-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (1762) Google Scholar). The delineation of apoptosis and necrosis as mutually exclusive processes, however, has not been convincingly demonstrated in vivo or in vitro. Previous studies describe apoptosis as a major histological feature of hyperoxia-induced lung injury in vivo (6Mantell L.L. Horowitz S. Davis J.M. Kazzaz J.A. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1999; 887: 171-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 7Otterbein L.E. Chin B.Y. Mantell L.L. Stansberry L. Horowitz S. Choi A.M. Am. J.

In contrast, hyperoxia primarily caused necrosis in A549 and in Type-I epithelial and murine lung bronchial cells (10Kazzaz J.A. Xu J. Palaia T.A. Mantell L. Fein A.M. Horowitz S. J. Biol.

Stansberry L. Kazzaz J.A. Koo H.C. Li Y. Arita Y. Davis J.M. Mantell A.S. Scott W. Mantell L.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 569-575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Thus, the mechanisms underlying hyperoxic lung injury and cell death may vary in a tissue-specific manner and may involve apoptosis, necrosis, or a mixed cell-death phenotype. Members of the death receptor superfamily, including Fas (14Barazzone C. Horowitz S. Donati Y.R. Rodriguez I. Piguet P.F. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol.

(15White C.W. Ghezzi P. Biotherapy. 1989; 1: 361-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), as well as Bcl family members (i.e. Bax and Bcl-XL) have been implicated in hyperoxic lung injury. Adult mice exposed to hyperoxia (>95% O2) for 72 h displayed increased whole-lung Bax and Bcl-XL mRNA levels; unaltered Bak, Bad, or Bcl-2 mRNA levels; and decreased Bcl-w and Bfl-1 mRNA levels (14Barazzone C.

Increases in Bcl-XL protein, but not Bax protein, have been reported in response to hyperoxia in the mouse lung (16O'Reilly M.A. Staversky R.J. Huyck H.L. Watkins R.H. LoMonaco M.B. D'Angio C.T.

Expression of the p53 protein responds to DNA damage and, in turn, regulates genes involved in growth control, DNA repair, and apoptosis. By increasing the expression of pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members such as Bax, p53 may promote cell death. A major regulatory target of p53, the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21, may protect against oxidative lung injury by inhibiting cell proliferation and DNA replication, and promoting DNA repair (11O'Reilly M.A. Staversky R.J.

Mice with different genetic backgrounds differ in oxygen sensitivity. In vivo studies using genetically modified mouse strains have revealed the relative roles of apoptosis-related proteins in oxygen sensitivity of the lung. Fas–/– (lpr) mice (14Barazzone C.

Murine embryonic fibroblasts derived from Bax–/– and Bak–/– mice resisted hyperoxia-induced cytotoxicity (22Budinger G.R. Tso M. McClintock D.S. Dean D.A. Sznajder J.I. Chandel N.S. J. Biol.

In contrast, p21–/– mice were more sensitive than wild-type mice, whereas p53–/– mice did not display any modulation of oxygen sensitivity (11O'Reilly M.A. Staversky R.J. Watkins R.H.

Physiol. 2001; 278: L552-L559Google Scholar). These observations suggest that downstream regulatory targets of p53 such as p21 and Bax modulate cellular sensitivity to hyperoxia, although p53 itself is apparently not essential. Despite these observations, the one or more signal transduction pathways involved in hyperoxic lung injury and cell death remain incompletely understood. In the current study, we demonstrate the involvement of apoptogenic factors in epithelial cell responses to hyperoxia, despite a final outcome of cellular necrosis. We have, for the first time, identified a predominant role for the caspase-8/Bid pathway in signaling associated with hyperoxic lung injury and cell death in vivo and in vitro. A second pathway involving Bax gains importance under conditions that inhibit or abolish the caspase-8/Bid pathway. We therefore provide an explanation for the lack of Bax modulation in the lungs of wild-type mice subjected to a lethal dose of hyperoxia. Chemicals and Reagents—Digitonin, disuccinimidyl suberate, etoposide, and other chemicals were from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO). Rabbit or goat polyclonal antibodies against Bax, Bcl-XL, Bid, caspase-8, caspase-9, cytochrome c, Fas, TNFR-1, and protein A-agarose were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA) and were used for Western blotting. Anti-Bax 6A7 antibody was purchased from BD Pharmingen (San Diego, CA) and used for immunoprecipitation experiments. The Flip, Bcl-X L, and LacZ inserted in an adenovirus expression system were from the Molecular Medicine Institute Programs of Excellence in Gene Therapy Vector Core Facility, University of Pittsburgh. Hyperoxia Exposure and Animal Experimentations—Normal, lpr (Fas null, Fas–/–), and gld (Fas ligand null, FasL–/–) adult (7 weeks) pathogen-free male C3H/HeJ mice and appropriate controls were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). C57BL Bid wild-type (Bid+/+) and Bid-null (Bid–/–) adult (7 weeks) mice were bred at the University of Pittsburgh. Mice were kept in room air (control) or exposed to >98% oxygen by placing the cages inside a plexiglass chamber. Animals were injected with 1 × 108 of adenovirus (inserted with appropriate gene) per mouse through the trachea into the lung 2 days prior to oxygen exposure. Food and water were provided normally. Animals were observed closely for overall mortality, and the time of death was recorded. Immediately after death, mice were necropsied, and their lungs were harvested for histochemical and biochemical analyses. Cell Culture and Treatments—Human lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells (ATCC CCL185) were grown in F12K medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were maintained at 37 °C in 95% room air, 5% CO2 in a humidified chamber. Subconfluent cultures were used in all experiments, with the cells adhered 24 h prior to the experimental treatment. Cells were cultured in sealed chambers flushed with 95% O2 and 5% CO2. Control cells were cultured in 95% room air, 5% CO2. For cells expressing the appropriate gene, 1 × 105 of adenovirus per milliliter was added to cells grown to about 30% confluence into the medium 2 days before exposure to O2. Increased glucose consumption has been observed in a number of cell types exposed to hyperoxia in culture. In 10 ml of medium, glucose was depleted and cellular ATP decreased after 36 h (24Allen C.B. White C.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: L159-L164PubMed Google Scholar). We refreshed the medium and gases daily to control for the equilibrium between apoptosis and necrosis that is influenced by maintaining the ATP levels (5Kroemer G. Dallaporta B. Resche-Rigon M. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1998; 60: 619-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (1762) Google Scholar). At each time point, cell viability was determined by Trypan blue dye exclusion analysis (Invitrogen). Apoptosis was determined by morphological changes and TUNEL assays. Preparation of Primary Fibroblast Cultures from Mouse Lung—Lung tissue was excised from either wild-type or Bid–/– mice. The lung tissue was soaked in a 1% antibiotic-antimycotic PBS (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) twice for 20 min. The tissue was minced into 1-mm pieces, which were plated onto p100 dishes (15–20 pieces per plate). Fetal bovine serum was added dropwise over each tissue piece, and then the plates were incubated for 4 h at 37 °C. Then 2 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics was added to each plate. The plates were restored to the incubator and monitored every day until the fibroblasts reached confluence. Cross-linking of Fas—After treatment of hyperoxia, A549 cells were grown to 90% confluence and were then washed three times with cold PBS. Freshly prepared disuccinimyl suberate in Me2SO was then added to a final concentration of 0.25 mm to the cells in 1 ml of PBS. The dishes were incubated for 30 min on a rocker platform. After cross-linking, each dish was washed two times with PBS. The cells were then harvested for Western blotting analysis. Annexin V/Propidium Iodide Staining—Using the annexin V-FITC kit from BD Pharmingen we followed the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, after hyperoxia treatment for 72 h, A549 cells were washed with cold PBS and resuspended with binding buffer (10 mm HEPES/NaOH, pH 7.4, 140 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2) before transferring 1 × 105 cells to a 5-ml tube. Then 5 μl of annexin V and 5 μl of propidium iodide were added, and the cells were incubated for 15 min in the dark. Binding buffer (400 μl) was then added to each tube and analyzed by flow cytometry. DNA Ladder—A549 cells treated with hyperoxia were trypsinized and washed with PBS, and then the cells were spun down and resuspended in lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 10 mm EDTA-2Na+, and 0.5% SDS. RNase A was then added at a concentration of 0.5 mg/ml and incubated at 37 °C for 60 min. Next, the protein was degraded using 0.5 mg/ml proteinase K at 50 °C for 60 min. DNA fragmentation was visualized with ethidium bromide staining after electrophoresis on a 1.2% agarose gel. Electron Microscopy Assays—Cell cultures were fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m sodium cacodylate buffer (pH 7.2) for 1 h at 4 °C. The cells were then postfixed in 1% osmium tetroxide, dehydrated in a graded series of ethanol, and embedded in LX112 (Ladd Corp., Burlington, VT). Thin sections (60 nm) were cut, stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate, and examined on a Zeiss EM 10 transmission electron microscope. Cytosol Isolation—At different times after exposure to hyperoxia, A549 cells were harvested in 0.05% of digitonin in extraction buffer containing 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm EGTA, and 2 mm MgCl2 with protease inhibitors. The cell extracts were spun at 14,000 × g for 20 min, and the supernatants were removed and used for Western blotting. Lactate Dehydrogenase Release Assay—LDH release was measured using a commercially available assay (Cytotoxicity Detection Kit, Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN). Lung fibroblasts derived from the wild-type or Bid–/– strains were treated with hyperoxia. After gentle agitation, 200 μl of medium was removed at different time points to be used for the assay. The samples were incubated (30 min) with buffer containing NAD+, lactate, and tetrazolium. LDH converts lactate to pyruvate, thus generating NADH. The NADH then reduces tetrazolium (yellow) to formazan (red), which was detected by absorbance (490 nm). Statistical Analysis—Fisher's exact test was used for analysis of the survival rate. The unpaired Student's t test was used for other data analyses as indicated, and a value of p < 0.05 was considered significant. Hyperoxia Induced Necrosis in A549 Epithelial Cells Involves the Release of Apoptogenic Factors from the Mitochondria— Morphological signs of injury appear in alveolar endothelial and epithelial cells within 48–72 h of exposure to lethal levels of oxygen (2Mantell L.L. Lee P.J. Mol. Genet. Metab. 2000; 71: 359-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Continued exposure for more than 72 h can result in epithelial cell death, and consequently, loss of alveolar integrity, airway fluid accumulation, and mortality. Hyperoxia primarily caused necrosis in A549 alveolar epithelial cells, as determined by fluorescence DNA labeling, in situ end labeling of DNA, and electron microscopy (10Kazzaz J.A. Xu J.

We exposed human epithelial cells (A549) to in vitro hyperoxia and then monitored the cells for survival. Flow cytometry with PI/Annexin-V double staining and DNA-laddering analyses demonstrated that hyperoxia caused A549 cell death primarily by necrosis (Fig. 1, B and C). Etoposide-induced apoptosis of Jurkat cells was used as positive controls (Fig. 1A). Quantitative data from our flow cytometry analyses (PI/Annexin-V double staining) demonstrate that >96% of the dead cells were necrotic, whereas 3% were apoptotic after 72 h of hyperoxia exposure. Furthermore, we also performed electron microscopy analysis of A549 cells at 72 h of hyperoxia, confirming the classic feature of necrosis as shown in Fig. 2. The epithelial cell growth medium was refreshed daily to maintain high levels of intracellular ATP (24Allen C.B. White C.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: L159-L164PubMed Google Scholar). Hyperoxia induced the necrotic death of A549 cells even in the presence of a high glucose concentration in the medium. Under these experimental conditions, <50% of these cells survived after 72 h of hyperoxia, by trypan blue analysis (Fig. 3A).Fig. 2Confirmation of necrosis in A549 cells induced by hyperoxia. A549 cells were cultured under 95% room air/5% CO2 (control) (A) and 95% O2/5% CO2 for 72 h (hyperoxia) (B) and analyzed by electron microscopy.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 3Human lung epithelial cells, A549, are killed by hyperoxia, in association with the activation of apoptogenic factors. A, A549 cells were cultured in quadruplet under 95% room air/5% CO2 (0) and 95% O2/5% CO2 for the indicated hours. The extent of death was determined by Trypan blue dye exclusion, and the data represent the average of three independent experiments (means ± S.E.). The value for 72 h in hyperoxia is significantly different (**, p < 0.01) from the control (0) or shorter hyperoxic exposures, using the unpaired Student's t test. B–E, cell lysates were then subjected to Western blot analyses as indicated to detect TNFR-1, Fas with/without cross-linking and caspase-8, (the latter from samples of immunoprecipitation with anti-Fas) (B), Bax and Bid (C), cytochrome c and caspase-9 (D), and Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL (E).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We hypothesized that apoptogenic factors may participate in hyperoxia-induced A549 cell necrosis. In many cell types, apoptosis may proceed through receptor-dependent pathways initiated by Fas ligand (FasL) or tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). FasL-mediated apoptosis begins with the formation of a death-inducing signal complex (DISC), that involves the death receptor Fas, Fas-associated death domain, and caspase-8. The consumption and recruitment of Fas leads to apparent decreases in Fas protein levels. Activated caspase-8 may in turn either activate effector caspases (i.e. caspase-3) or cleave Bid. The activated form of Bid triggers apoptosis by mitochondrial translocation, which stimulates cytochrome c release (25Yin X.M. Cell Res. 2000; 10: 161-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). On the other hand, receptor-independent apoptosis may involve the mitochondrial-translocation of pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members such as Bax. In the mitochondria, Bax oligomers form membrane channels by opening the permeability transition pore, leading to cytochrome c release and caspase activation (26Brady H.J. Gil-Gomez G. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 30: 647-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Once released in the cytosol, cytochrome c binds to Apaf-1, stimulating its ATP-dependent oligomerization, which in turn leads to the recruitment of procaspase-9 and its activation to caspase-9. The role of apoptotic pathways in hyperoxia-induced A549 epithelial cell necrosis was evaluated in vitro, by monitoring the expression of death receptors (Fas and TNFR-I) and Bcl-2 family proteins. Following treatment of A549 cells with hyperoxia (24–72 h), Fas protein levels decreased, whereas TNFR-I protein levels remained unchanged (Fig. 3B). Anti-Fas immunoprecipitation revealed an interaction of caspase-8 with Fas (Fig. 3B), demonstrating DISC formation, the initiation of the Fas-induced apoptotic pathway. We show here for the first time, that hyperoxia up-regulated the activation of both Bax and Bid in A549 cells (Fig. 3C) with release of cytochrome c into the cytosol (Fig. 3D). After 24 h exposure to hyperoxia, active caspase-9 appeared in A549 cells (Fig. 3D). We next examined the expression of the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member Bcl-XL as a function of hyperoxic exposure in A549 cells. Bcl-XL inhibits mitochondrial cytochrome c release and subsequent caspase activation (27Finucane D.M. Bossy-Wetzel E. Waterhouse N.J. Cotter T.G. Green D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2225-2233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar, 28Susin S.A. Lorenzo H.K. Zamzami N. Marzo I. Snow B.E. Brothers G.M. Mangion J. Jacotot E.

Li X. Zhai Z. Shu H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25617-25623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). After 48 h in hyperoxia, the expression of Bcl-XL increased in A549 cells (Fig. 3E), whereas Bcl-2 expression did not change (Fig. 3E). The high expression of Bcl-XL apparently did not protect A549 cells from cell death. Overexpression of FLIP Increased Survival under Hyperoxia in Vitro and in Vivo—Because hyperoxia treatment led to caspase-8 and Bid activation, and increased Bcl-XL expression in A549 cells, we hypothesized that modulation of these apoptosis-related proteins may influence oxygen sensitivity in vitro. A549 cells were infected with adenoviral constructs inserted with Bcl-X L, Flip, or LacZ (Fig. 4A), exposed to in vitro hyperoxia for 72 h, and monitored for necrotic cell death. Overexpression of the caspase-8 inhibitor, FLIP (but not Bcl-XL), significantly protected the cells from death during hyperoxia, relative to the LacZ control (p < 0.05) (Fig. 4B). We hypothesized that inhibition of caspase-8 would also modulate oxygen sensitivity in vivo. We infected C3H/HeJ mice with adenoviral constructs inserted with Flip, Bcl-X L, or LacZ. After 48 h, the mice were exposed to >95% O2 and monitored for overall survival. Interestingly, the FLIP group was significantly more resistant to oxygen toxicity than the LacZ-infected group (Fig. 4C). On the other hand, there was no significant difference in hyperoxia resistance between the Bcl-XL-expressing group and the LacZ control group (Fig. 4C). These results emphasize an important role for the caspase-8/Bid pathway in sensitivity to hyperoxia. These results also suggest that increases in Bcl-XL protein expression do not protect against hyperoxia-induced lung injury or cell death. Overexpression of FLIP in A549 Epithelial Cells Inhibited Bid Expression, and Bax Conformational Change Induced by Hyperoxia—Bid assists Bax in a conformational change that unmasks the Bax NH2-terminal domain and coincides with mitochondrial cytochrome c release (30Desagher S. Osen-Sand A. Nichols A. Eskes R. Montessuit S. Lauper S. Maundrell K. Antonsson B. Martinou J.C. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 891-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (1093) Google Scholar). Thus, the Bax mitochondrial membrane insertion triggered by Bid may represent a key step in the pathways leading to apoptosis (31Eskes R. Desagher S. Antonsson B. Martinou J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 929-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (1016) Google Scholar). Therefore we investigated the hypothesis that Bax conformational change may respond to the levels of active Bid in A549 cells subjected to hyperoxia. A549 cells were infected with adenoviral constructs containing Bcl-X L, Flip, or LacZ insertions and then grown under hyperoxia (72 h). Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with the anti-Bax monoclonal antibody (6A7) that specifically recognizes the conformational change in Bax protein (32Murphy K.M. Streips U.N. Lock R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 257: 17225-17228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (124) Google Scholar). FLIP overexpression decreased Bid protein levels and inhibited the conformational change of Bax, compared with LacZ controls (Fig. 5). In contrast, Bcl-XL overexpression only slightly decreased the expression of Bid protein and Bax conformational change relative to LacZ controls (Fig. 5). These results support the hypothesis that Bid assists in a Bax conformational change that increases the efficiency of Bax in promoting cell death. lpr (Fas –/– ) and gld (FasL –/– ) Mice Did Not Display Increased Resistance to Hyperoxia but Displayed Increased Bax Protein Expression Levels—We hypothesized that a Fas-induced apoptosis-like process may precede necrotic cell death in vivo. lpr mice (Fas–/–), however, did not display increased resistance to hyperoxia (14Barazzone C. Horowitz S. Donati Y.R. Rodriguez I. Piguet P.F. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1998; 19: 573-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). We challenged lpr (Fas–/–) and gld (FasL–/–) mice with hyperoxia and monitored survival. As shown in Fig. 6A, both Fas–/– and FasL–/– mice exhibited similar survival curves in response to hyperoxia relative to the C3H/HeJ wild-type mice, without significant statistical difference"
https://openalex.org/W2004220682,"The macromolecular organization within saliva was investigated by tracer diffusion measurements of fluorescent polystyrene microspheres by fluorescence recovery after photobleaching using a confocal microscope (confocal-FRAP). There was a concentration-dependent reduction in microsphere diffusion; this was much greater in the presence of calcium (10 mm) and was reduced by the addition of EGTA (10 mm). These effects on tracer diffusion showed that native saliva contained a macromolecular organization that was sensitive to free calcium concentrations. This was supported by a major increase in the weight average molecular weight of the high molecular weight mucin fraction in saliva (10–62 × 106) and an increase in intrinsic viscosity of saliva (733 to 1203 ml/g) both caused by calcium. Analysis of the change in tracer diffusion in saliva showed a 20-fold increase in the apparent pore size (from 130 nm in 10 mm CaCl2 to 2600 nm in 10 mm EGTA at physiological concentration). The effect was specific for calcium and was unaffected by up to 2 m NaCl. The calcium binding activity was contained in a high buoyant density fraction of saliva excluded from Sepharose CL-2B. Calcium binding to this fraction gave an approximate K d of 7 × 10–6m, and the binding was irreversibly destroyed by treatment with 6 m guanidinium chloride and by mild reduction, suggesting it to be to a protein site. This fraction of saliva was shown to contain MUC5B as the single major protein species by positive ion electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry analysis. The results suggested that oligomeric MUC5B in saliva is assembled into much larger linear or branched assemblies through calcium-mediated protein cross-links.

Mucus forms a viscoelastic gel that coats the epithelial surfaces in humans and other vertebrates. The properties of the gel have been interpreted as being predominantly due to entanglement of the long, high molecular weight oligomeric mucins (1Carlstedt I. Sheehan J.K. Corfield A.P.

Mucus has also been described as a network weakly cross-linked by non-covalent bonds (3Crowther R.S. Marriott C. James S.L.

Biorheology. 1987; 24: 625-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), pH (10Verdugo P. Annu. Rev.

Thus the supramolecular organization of the mucus layer is complex, and the molecular basis of this organization remains poorly defined. A layer of mucus coats the surfaces of the gastrointestinal, reproductive, and respiratory tracts as well as the eyes and oral cavity (14Madsen F. Eberth K. Smart J.D. J. Control Release. 1998; 50: 167-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). This layer is the bodies' first line of defense against chemical, physical, and biological insult and a change in this barrier will compromise health. For example, in the airways overproduction of mucus with aberrant rheological properties is a feature of asthma, cystic fibrosis, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. In these situations the change in the physical properties of the barrier leads to a breakdown in mucus clearance from the airways with the attendant problems of poor gas exchange, bacterial colonization, and inflammation (10Verdugo P. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1990; 52: 157-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). To gain further insight into mucus organization we have recently employed diffusion analysis by fluorescence recovery after photobleaching using a confocal microscope (confocal-FRAP) 1The abbreviations used are: confocal-FRAP, fluorescence recovery after photobleaching using a confocal microscope; GdmCl, guanidinium chloride; DTT, dithiothreitol; ESI-MS-MS, positive ion electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry; MALLS, multiangle laser light-scattering. to study the properties of saliva (15Raynal B.D. Hardingham T.E. Thornton D.J. Sheehan J.K. Biochem. J. 2002; 362: 289-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). This technique provides a powerful approach to investigate the properties of macromolecules in concentrated solution (16Gribbon P. Hardingham T.E. Biophys. J. 1998; 75: 1032-1039Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). It enables molecular mobility to be determined in complex mixtures in the absence of flow and shear forces. In initial work we characterized the concentration dependence of the self-diffusion of the MUC5B mucin, the predominant oligomeric mucin present in saliva. The measurement of lateral translational diffusion of fluorescent microspheres of different size in solutions of purified MUC5B mucin and in native saliva was used to provide a direct estimate of the porosity (15Raynal B.D. Hardingham T.E. Thornton D.J. Sheehan J.K. Biochem. J. 2002; 362: 289-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 17Gribbon P. Heng B.C. Hardingham T.E. Biophys.

The results showed that purified MUC5B formed concentrated solutions in physiological saline in which there was no evidence of self-association, and the properties at high concentration were as predicted by molecular entanglement of the oligomeric mucins (15Raynal B.D. Hardingham T.E. Thornton D.J. Sheehan J.K. Biochem. J. 2002; 362: 289-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Intermolecular hydrophobic interactions between mucins were not detected, neither were carbohydrate-carbohydrate interactions (15Raynal B.D. Hardingham T.E. Thornton D.J. Sheehan J.K. Biochem. J. 2002; 362: 289-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). However, comparison of native saliva with the solutions of guanidinium chloride (GdmCl) purified MUC5B under similar ionic conditions revealed that saliva had much lower porosity than the purified mucin at comparable concentrations, showing that saliva contained an additional level of organization that was absent from the purified MUC5B mucin (15Raynal B.D. Hardingham T.E. Thornton D.J. Sheehan J.K. Biochem. J. 2002; 362: 289-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In the present study, we investigated the basis of the additional organization present in saliva, which reduced tracer diffusion. Materials—Trypsin, modified by reductive alkylation to reduce autolysis, was purchased from Promega (Southampton, UK). Acetonitrile (high performance liquid chromatography grade) was purchased from Rathburn Chemicals (Walkerburn, UK). Calcium chloride, urea, Tris, and sodium chloride were from BDH (Poole, UK). Guanidinium chloride (practical grade), EGTA, and iodoacetamide were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. (Poole, UK). Stock solutions of guanidinium chloride (∼8 m) were treated with charcoal before use. The Pepmap column was from Dionex (Camberely, UK) and radioactive Calcium-45 (1 mCi), Sephacryl S-1000, Sepharose CL-2B, and PD-10 size exclusion columns (Sephadex G-25) were from Amersham Biosciences (UK). Dithiothreitol (DTT) was from Melford Laboratories (Ipswich, UK), and cesium chloride was from Q-Biogene (Alexis Ltd., Nottingham, UK). Saliva Collection and Determination of MUC5B Concentration— Fresh whole human saliva was collected from 5–10 healthy donors and centrifuged at 2700 × g for 30 min at 4 °C to remove particulate matter. The preparation was homogenous with a pH of 6.2–7.0. It was stored at 4 °C and was used within 5 days and showed no significant change in pH or properties over this time. MUC5B mucin concentration was determined by refractive index measurements as described previously (15Raynal B.D. Hardingham T.E. Thornton D.J. Sheehan J.K. Biochem. J. 2002; 362: 289-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Viscosity and Molecular Weight Determination—Three aliquots of saliva (15 ml) were dialyzed separately against: buffer A, 0.1 m NaCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.0; buffer B, the same buffer with 10 mm EGTA; or buffer C, the same buffer with 10 mm CaCl2. The dialysate of each sample was kept as control buffer. For molecular weight determination, the dialyzed samples were chromatographed on a Sephacryl S-1000 column (300 × 10 mm) eluted with their respective buffer (buffers A–C) at a flow rate of 12 ml/h. The mass average molecular mass was determined using an in-line multiangle laser light-scattering (MALLS) photometer and a differential refractometer (Dawn DSP, Wyatt Technology, Santa Barbara, CA). For each sample, analysis of the weight average molecular weight was carried out by integrating the major high molecular weight mucin peak between 6 and 15 ml of elution volume with a refractive increment (dn/dc) of 0.160 ml/g. Viscosity determinations were carried out in an Ostwald capillary viscometer at a constant temperature of 25 °C. Samples were diluted in their respective buffers (A–C) to give concentration between 29 and 204 μg/ml. For each sample, the flow time in the viscometer was measured five times and averaged. Intrinsicviscosity[η]=limc→0ηspecc=limc→0t-t0t0c(Eq. 1) Where t and t 0 are sample and buffer flow times, respectively, and c is the MUC5B mucin concentration. The intrinsic viscosity [η] was measured by plotting the reduced viscosity as a function of mucin concentration (Huggins plot). From Equation 1 the fitted straight line at zero concentration gave the intrinsic viscosity. Straight line correlations were all above 0.98. MUC5B Mucin Preparation from Saliva under Denaturing Conditions—MUC5B mucins were purified from saliva, by established methods (15Raynal B.D. Hardingham T.E. Thornton D.J. Sheehan J.K. Biochem. J. 2002; 362: 289-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Saliva was initially equilibrated in 6 m GdmCl and fractionated by size exclusion chromatography and two-step density-gradient centrifugation in 4 m GdmCl. This preparation was dialyzed into relevant ionic solutions prior to measurements. Mucin Preparation from Saliva under Non-denaturing Conditions— Fresh saliva was gently stirred overnight at 4 °C with an equal volume of 0.2 m NaCl. The pH was 6.2–7.0. After centrifugation (4400 × g, 30 min, 4 °C), the supernatant was fractionated by equilibrium density-gradient centrifugation (starting density, 1.45 mg/ml) in CsCl/0.1 m NaCl, pH 6.5, in a Beckman Ti45 rotor at 40,000 rpm for 65 h at 15 °C. The high density fractions containing MUC5B mucin were pooled, dialyzed against 0.1 m NaCl, pH 6.5, and stored at 4 °C after the addition of 0.05% (w/v) sodium azide. A 25-ml fraction of this preparation was chromatographed on a size exclusion column (1000 × x 52 mm, Sepharose CL-2B) eluted in 0.1 m NaCl, 10 mm EGTA, pH 8.0, at a flow rate of 24 ml/h. MUC5B mucin fractions, in the void volume of the column, were pooled and dialyzed against 0.1 m NaCl, pH 6.5, and part was concentrated against polyethylene glycol (5% w/v) and tested for calcium-dependent effects on tracer diffusion by confocal-FRAP. Protein Identification by Mass Spectrometry—An aliquot of the high density MUC5B mucin-containing fraction purified by CsCl density gradient under non-denaturing conditions (see above) was reduced (10 mm DTT for 2 h) and alkylated (25 mm iodoacetamide for 30 min in the dark) and then dialyzed against water and lyophilized. In addition, a 5-ml aliquot of the pooled high density MUC5B mucin-containing fraction was chromatographed on a size exclusion column (600 × 10 mm, Sepharose CL-2B) eluted in 0.1 m NaCl, pH 6.5, containing 10 mm CaCl2 at a flow rate of 60 ml/h. The void volume fraction was reduced and alkylated as described above. Both preparations were digested overnight at 37 °C with 1 μg of trypsin per 10 μg of protein in 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate pH 8.0. Tryptic peptides were separated by reverse-phase chromatography and analyzed in-line by positive ion ESI-MS-MS using a Q-ToF micro mass spectrometer (Micromass, Manchester, UK). Samples were introduced via a capillary liquid chromatography system fitted with a stream select module (Micromass). Aliquots (10–50 μl) of the samples were separated on a Pepmap column (0.075 × 150 mm) with a gradient of 5% acetonitrile in 0.1% formic acid to 25% acetonitrile in 0.1% formic acid over 30 min at a flow rate of 200 nl/min. This process was repeated twice for each sample, and peptides identified in the first run were excluded from the second analysis. Data acquired were analyzed using SwissProt and Trembl databases using the Proteinlynx global server 1.1 software (Micromass). Parameters were set to 100-mDa peptide mass tolerance, methionine oxidation and carboxyamidomethyl cysteine modification. The MS-MS spectrum of each peptide matched was examined individually with the acceptance criteria being that the parent and fragment ion masses were within the calibrated tolerance limits and that the spectrum contained a series of at least four consecutive y′ ions. Preparation of Samples for Tracer Diffusion Measurements—For all tracer diffusion measurements, fluorescent polystyrene microspheres (average diameter 499 nm), preincubated with bovine serum albumin (15Raynal B.D. Hardingham T.E. Thornton D.J. Sheehan J.K. Biochem. J. 2002; 362: 289-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), were mixed, 2% (w/v), with the samples, and equilibrated overnight at 4 °C. All confocal-FRAP measurements on saliva and MUC5B solutions were performed in the presence of 0.1 m NaCl, pH 6.2–7.0 and at 25 °C, except in the experiments on temperature dependence in which samples were equilibrated for 30 min at temperatures from 15–52.5 °C. For determining the concentration dependence of tracer diffusion, saliva was initially concentrated by dialysis against aquacide. For measurements in the presence or absence of 10 mm CaCl2, the concentration of MUC5B in the saliva was up to 0.1 mg/ml. In the presence of 10 mm EGTA the concentration of MUC5B was up to 0.960 mg/ml. MUC5B samples purified under denaturing conditions were diluted in 0.1 m NaCl, pH 6.5, and measurements were made on solutions up to 1.29 mg/ml. To determine the effects of cations on tracer diffusion the salts of divalent cations (CaCl2, MgCl2, MnCl2, and ZnCl2) or EGTA were added to give final concentrations up to 4 mm. To assess the reversibility of the effects, after the addition of CaCl2, EGTA was added to a concentration equivalent to the CaCl2 and the confocal-FRAP measurements were repeated. To determine the effect of detergent on tracer diffusion, Triton X-100 up to 2% (v/v) was added to saliva solutions. Diffusion Measurements by Confocal-FRAP—Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching experiments were carried out using a confocal laser microscope (MRC-1000, Bio-Rad, Hemel Hempstead, UK) with an upright epifluorescence microscope (Optiphot 2, Nikon, Japan) (16Gribbon P. Hardingham T.E. Biophys. J. 1998; 75: 1032-1039Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). For tracer diffusion experiments, 10-μl samples containing 499-nm microspheres were sealed under glass coverslips on a flat microscope slide. The confocal-FRAP technique determines the lateral translational diffusion coefficients, which were calculated from the time dependence of the plots of the second moment of the radially averaged distribution of bleached fluorophore (16Gribbon P.

Five replicates were performed for each experiment. In the temperature dependence experiments the temperature was controlled using a cooling and heating system (PE-60, Linkam Instruments, Tadworth, UK) attached to the slide holder on the confocal microscope. The concentration dependence of translational diffusion coefficients of the tracer in saliva and purified MUC5B was calculated using the scaling equation for tracer diffusion in semi-dilute polymer networks (20Phillies G.D.J. J. Phys. Chem. 1989; 93: 5029-5039Crossref Scopus (171) Google Scholar) in Equation 2, D=D0exp(-βcν)(Eq. 2) where D is the measured apparent lateral translational tracer diffusion coefficient, D 0 is its free diffusion coefficient, and β and ν are empirical constants and are related to the average pore size of the network ξ (19DeSmedt S.C. Lauwers A. Demeester J. Engelborghs Y. Demey G. Du M. Macromolecules. 1994; 27: 141-146Crossref Scopus (74) Google Scholar) (Equation 3), which describes the distance between chain entanglement points (22De Gennes P.G. Scaling Concepts in Polymer Physics. Cornell University Press, Ithaca, NY1979Google Scholar) in Equation 3. ξ=-d/ln(D/D0)(Eq. 3) In this equation d is the diameter of the tracer. This assumes that the polymer forms a regular network of linked strands. For polymers, such as mucin solutions, in which interchain associations are transient and the network formed would be dynamic, ξ is an average dimension representing a distribution of apparent pore sizes. In semi-dilute solutions of polymers, this analysis of tracer diffusion, which gives an apparent pore size, therefore provides a combined measure of chain entanglement, together with any additional effect of specific interchain association. Calcium Binding—Calcium binding to the high density MUC5B mucin fraction purified under mild non-denaturing conditions was assessed by size exclusion chromatography. To the mucin fraction (500 μl at 50 μg/ml in 0.1 m NaCl, pH 6.5) 45CaCl2 (3.256 Ci/mmol) was added to a final concentration of 70 μm and incubated overnight at room temperature. The sample was chromatographed on a column of Sepharose CL-2B (6 × 100 mm) eluted in 0.1 m NaCl, pH 6.5. Fractions (250 μl) were collected, and the radioactivity was measured by scintillation counting. Calcium binding was also determined (as above) after treatment of the high density mucin fraction with 6 m GdmCl. A sample of the mucin was dialyzed into 6 m GdmCl (pH 6.2) overnight at 4 °C and then back into 0.1 m NaCl, pH 6.5, prior to addition of radioactive 45CaCl2. The high density mucin fraction was also treated by adding 10 mm DTT for 30 min at 37 °C prior to incubation with radioactive calcium overnight at room temperature and chromatography (as above). To estimate the affinity of calcium binding different concentrations of radioactive 45CaCl2 (0.63 to 15.8 μm, 3.256 Ci/mmol) were added to 500 μl of the high density mucin fraction (MUC5B concentration 15 μg/ml in 0.1 m NaCl, pH 6.5). The samples were chromatographed on PD-10 size exclusion columns (Sephadex G-25) eluted in 25 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.0, and the radioactivity in fractions (500 μl) was measured by scintillation counting. Previous work measuring tracer diffusion of fluorescent polystyrene microspheres by confocal-FRAP showed that GdmCl-purified salivary MUC5B mucin was much more permeable to tracer diffusion than saliva at similar concentrations of MUC5B mucin (15Raynal B.D. Hardingham T.E. Thornton D.J. Sheehan J.K. Biochem. J. 2002; 362: 289-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated the properties of saliva further to discover the basis for this difference in molecular organization. Tracer diffusion in saliva and GdmCl-purified MUC5B solution showed a concentration-dependent reduction in diffusion of microspheres (499-nm diameter) (Fig. 1A). This followed the general form predicted for entanglement of high molecular weight polymers (see Equation 2) (20Phillies G.D.J. J. Phys. Chem. 1989; 93: 5029-5039Crossref Scopus (171) Google Scholar). From the results of tracer diffusion the change in apparent pore size with concentration was calculated (see “Experimental Procedures,” Equation 3) (Fig. 1B). This showed that the apparent pore size in GdmCl-purified MUC5B solution was four times larger than in saliva, when extrapolated to similar MUC5B concentration (100 μg/ml) close to that found physiologically. The difference was not due to ionic strength effects, because both preparations were analyzed in 0.1 m NaCl. To understand the basis for the difference in apparent pore size, we carried out further tracer diffusion experiments on saliva at concentrations of MUC5B in the mid-range of the concentration-dependence curve (45–55 μg/ml, Fig. 1A). At this concentration any change in tracer diffusion therefore reflects changes in the organization of the macromolecules in saliva that determine the rate of diffusion. Effect of Calcium and EGTA on Saliva—The addition of CaCl2, up to 4 mm to saliva in 0.1 m NaCl, caused a major decrease in the diffusion of the microspheres, which fell from 5.6 × 10–9 to 1.8 × 10–9 cm2.s–1 (Fig. 1C). From these diffusion measurements, the apparent pore size in saliva (calculated from Equation 3, see “Experimental Procedures”) decreased from ∼1200 to 300 nm after addition of 4 mm CaCl2 (Fig. 1D). In a similar experiment at the same saliva concentration, adding EGTA increased tracer diffusion (Fig. 1C), and at over 3 mm EGTA the diffusion became equal to the free diffusion. The result suggested that EGTA was chelating calcium in saliva and causing an increase in tracer diffusion. The calculated apparent pore size increased from ∼1200 to 7000 nm in the presence of 2.5 mm EGTA (Fig. 1D). The apparent pore size of saliva from tracer diffusion measurements was thus increased six times by EGTA. These major changes in tracer diffusion at a constant concentration of the saliva suggested that calcium has a major effect on the organization of the macromolecules in saliva. The reversibility of this effect was shown by confocal-FRAP analysis of a sample treated with EGTA and then reequilibrated with calcium and re-tested. The tracer diffusion increased by EGTA returned to a low rate in the presence of calcium (results not shown). The calcium effect was independent of pH in the neutral range pH 6–8 (results not shown). The experiments suggested that calcium was easily bound and removed from sites of interaction and that the change in macromolecular organization in saliva was freely reversible. A more complete assessment of the effects of calcium on tracer diffusion over the full range of saliva concentration was obtained (Fig. 1A). There was a major reduction of tracer diffusion throughout the concentration range compared with untreated saliva, with the effect detected at very low concentrations of MUC5B (5.5 μg/ml). In contrast, in the presence of EGTA, the saliva was much more permeable to tracer diffusion, and effects on microsphere diffusion were only detected above 240 μg/ml (Fig. 1A). From these results the apparent pore size showed approximately a 20-fold difference between EGTA- and CaCl2-treated saliva (Table I) when compared at a physiological concentration. Interestingly, the tracer diffusion of the microspheres in GdmCl-purified MUC5B mucin solution showed a similar concentration dependence as in saliva treated with EGTA (Fig. 1A).Table IAnalysis of tracer diffusionCritical concentrationLateral diffusion D0 × 10-9Estimated size (ξ) at 100 μg/ml of MUC5Bμg/mlcm2 s-1nmSaliva36.910.9620Saliva plus 10 mm CaCl25.58.6130Saliva plus 10 mm EGTA24012.92600GdmCl MUC5B32412.92710GdmCl MUC5B plus 10 mm CaCl232013.22740 Open table in a new tab These initial observations of calcium effects on tracer diffusion were investigated further by measuring two other independent properties. The viscosity of saliva was similar to that previously determined by others under similar ionic conditions (23Nordbo H. Darwish S. Bhatnagar R.S. J. DENT. Res. 1984; 92: 306-314Google Scholar, 24Veerman E.C.I. Valentijn-benz M. Nieuw Amerogen A.V. J. Biol. Buccale. 1989; 17: 297-306PubMed Google Scholar). However, with the addition of 10 mm CaCl2, there was a large increase in intrinsic viscosity (1033 to 1233 ml/g), and with 10 mm EGTA there was a large decrease in intrinsic viscosity (1033 to 733 ml/g) (Fig. 2A and Table II). The presence of calcium thus caused the saliva to be more viscous. Analysis of native saliva by gel filtration on S-1000 combined with MALLS analysis showed it to contain a high molecular weight fraction with an approximate weight average molecular weight of 28 × 106. In the presence of CaCl2 (10 mm) the molecular weight distribution of the same high molecular weight fraction showed a major increase to ∼62 × 106, and this was reduced dramatically to ∼10 × 106 in the presence of EGTA (10 mm) (Fig. 2B and Table II). Calcium thus caused a major increase in (a) the viscosity of saliva and (b) the average molecular weight of the high molecular weight components in saliva.Table IIViscosity and molecular weight distribution[η]Weight average molecular weightml·g-1× 106Saliva103327.6Saliva plus 10 mm CaCl2120361.8Saliva plus 10 mm EGTA73310.1 Open table in a new tab Effect of Solvent Ionic Strength and Divalent Cations (Mg2 + , Mn2 + , and Zn2 + ) on Tracer Diffusion in Saliva—The effect of calcium on tracer diffusion in saliva was unaffected by NaCl concentration 0.1 to 2 m (Fig. 3A). The calcium effect was thus unlikely to be due to simple electrostatic interaction among the macromolecules within saliva. The effects of other divalent ions were investigated. With addition of MgCl2, MnCl2, and ZnCl2 up to 4 mm there was no change in tracer diffusion (Fig. 3B). The results showed that other common divalent metal ions cannot substitute for calcium ions and therefore that calcium has a specific effect on macromolecular organization in saliva. Effect of Temperature on Tracer Diffusion in Saliva—Tracer diffusion was determined on saliva equilibrated at different temperature (15–52.5 °C) (Fig. 3C). As the temperature increased the tracer diffusion of the microspheres increased by 20% over the full range of temperature, when corrected for the effect of viscosity changes of the solvent on tracer diffusion. The effect was reversible, because on cooling the diffusion of the microspheres decreased and returned to the initial value. From th"

Here we present biochemical evidence supporting this idea. Isu, the proposed scaffold on which Fe/S centers are assembled, is a substrate for both Jac1 and Ssq1.

However, unlike the bacterial Hsp70, we found that Ssq1 has a high affinity for nucleotide, and shares a nucleotide exchange factor, Mge1, with a second mitochondrial Hsp70, Ssc1.

Thus, whereas the bacterial and mitochondrial chaperone systems share critical features, they possess significant biochemical differences as well. Extensive genetic and cell biological evidence supports the idea that two mitochondrial molecular chaperones work together, along with other proteins, in the processes of iron-sulfur center biogenesis and mitochondrial iron homeostasis (1Craig E.

Chem. 2001; 276: 17524-17532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial proteins functioning in biogenesis of Fe/S centers are related to bacterial proteins encoded by the isc (iron-sulfur cluster) operon, indicating a bacterial origin of this important process (for review, see Ref. 9Craig E.A. Marszalek J. CMLS Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2002; 59: 1658-1665Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Among the proteins encoded by the isc operon of Escherichia coli are two chaperones, Hsc66, an Hsp70 and Hsc20, a J-type protein (10Seaton B.L. Vickery L.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2066-2070Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 11Kawula T. Lelivelt M. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 610-619Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), along with IscU, the protein that is thought to serve as a scaffold on which Fe/S centers are built prior to transfer to a recipient protein (12Agar J.N. Krebs C. Frazzon J. Huynh B.H. Dean D.R. Johnson M.K. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7856-7862Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). Hsc66 shares many biochemical properties with other Hsp70s, including another Hsp70 of the bacterial cytosol, the abundant and well studied DnaK. Both possess ATPase activities, which are stimulated by specific J-type co-chaperones: DnaJ for DnaK and Hsc20 for Hsc66 (13Silberg J.J. Hoff K.G. Vickery L.E. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 6617-6624Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although Hsp70 and J-proteins most often bind unfolded or partially folded polypeptides, a few native proteins have been identified as substrates. For example, the transcription factor σ32 and phage λ DNA replication proteins λP and λO are substrates of DnaK and DnaJ (14Wawrzynow A. Zylicz M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19300-19306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Recent evidence indicates that IscU, the scaffold for Fe/S center assembly, is a native substrate of the Hsc66/Hsc20 pair (15Silberg J.J. Hoff K.G. Tapley T.L. Vickery L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1696-1700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). As expected for a substrate protein, IscU stimulates the ATPase activity of Hsc66. In addition, the apparent affinity of Hsc66 for IscU is higher in the presence of ADP compared with ATP. This nucleotide sensitivity is a hallmark of an Hsp70 cycle of protein substrate binding and releasing (16Bukau B. Horwich A.L. Cell. 1998; 92: 351-366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2429) Google Scholar). When ADP is bound, Hsp70 exhibits stable substrate binding; when ATP is bound, binding of substrate is unstable. Whereas the ATP state of an Hsp70 is a low affinity state for substrate protein, the on-rate for substrate is very rapid, and thus thought to be the productive state for initiating binding in vivo. ATP hydrolysis then promotes conversion to the high affinity state, and ADP release, followed by ATP binding, promotes substrate release, completing the chaperone cycle. J-proteins, because they both can bind protein substrates themselves and stimulate the ATP hydrolysis of Hsp70s have been proposed to “target” substrate proteins to Hsp70s (16Bukau B. Horwich A.L. Cell. 1998; 92: 351-366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2429) Google Scholar). IscU binds Hsc20, as well as Hsc66, and stimulation of the ATPase of Hsc66 is enhanced several hundredfold when IscU and Hsc20 are present simultaneously. Thus, Hsc20 could well play a role in “targeting” of IscU, similar to the targeting of σ32 to DnaK by DnaJ (17Hoff K.G. Silberg J.J. Vickery L.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7790-7795Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 18Liberek K. Wall D. Georgopoulos C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6224-6228Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) Transient interactions between Hsp70 and its protein substrates are essential for the biological functions of chaperones. If the off-rate of nucleotide from an Hsp70 is slow, a factor is needed to facilitate nucleotide release, which in turn promotes release of protein substrate. The DnaK/DnaJ chaperone system requires the nucleotide release factor GrpE (19Liberek K. Marszalek J. Ang D. Georgopoulos C. Zylicz M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2874-2878Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). Only in the presence of both DnaJ and GrpE is the steady-state ATPase activity of DnaK significantly stimulated. In contrast, the off-rate of nucleotide from Hsc66 is much faster than that from DnaK (20Silberg J.J. Vickery L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7779-7786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 21Brehmer D. Rudiger S. Glassler C.S. Klostermeier D. Packschies L. Reinstein J. Mayer M.P. Bukau B. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 427-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Consistent with this observation, significant stimulation of Hsc66 ATPase activity by Hsc20 and IscU is observed in the absence of any nucleotide release factor (17Hoff K.G. Silberg J.J. Vickery L.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7790-7795Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). These data also imply that two distinct Hsp70 systems exist in E. coli: DnaK, functioning with co-chaperones DnaJ and GrpE and Hsc66 functioning with Hsc20. As in the bacterial cytosol, the mitochondrial matrix contains another Hsp70 system that is closely related to the DnaK/DnaJ/GrpE chaperone machine: the Hsp70 Ssc1, the J-protein Mdj1, and the nucleotide-release factor Mge1. Like the DnaK/DnaJ/GrpE system, these abundant proteins function generically, interacting with a wide variety of protein substrates. The DnaK system facilitates the folding of many proteins, particularly after periods of stress. The Ssc1 system engages in a wide spectrum of biochemical processes including protein translocation across the mitochondrial inner membrane, folding of proteins after import, and reactivation or degradation of proteins that either fold improperly or become permanently damaged after exposure to stress (for review see Ref. 22Neupert W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 863-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (978) Google Scholar, 23Voos W. Martin H. Krimmer T. Pfanner N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1422: 235-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 24Craig E. Yan W. James P. Bukau B. Molecular Chaperones and Folding Catalysts: Regulation, Cellular Function and Mechanisms. Harwood, Amsterdam1999: 139-162Google Scholar). However, both Hsc66 and Ssq1 are thought to function in a single metabolic process, the biogenesis of Fe/S centers. Thus far an important difference between these bacterial and mitochondrial Hsp70s has been determined. Whereas Hsc66 and DnaK are present at similar concentrations in bacteria (25Vickery L.E. Silberg J.J. Ta D.T. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 1047-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 26Hesterkamp T. Bukau B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4818-4828Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), Ssq1 is between 250- and 1000-fold less abundant than Ssc1, which constitutes ∼2% of mitochondrial protein (7Voisine C. Schilke B. Ohlson M. Beinert H. Marszalek J. Craig E.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3677-3684Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Whereas there is much in vivo evidence to suggest that Ssq1 and Jac1 function together in Fe/S center biogenesis, no direct biochemical evidence has been presented. Here we report that Ssq1 functions with Jac1 by stimulating binding of Ssq1 to its specific native protein substrate, Isu1, a homolog of bacterial IscU. We also show that in contrast to bacterial Hsc66, mitochondrial Ssq1 stably binds ATP and, therefore, requires a nucleotide release factor, Mge1, for stimulation of its ATPase activity. Thus, although there are significant similarities in the biochemical properties of Ssq1 and Hsc66, there are significant differences as well. Overexpression and Purification of Proteins—Recombinant Jac1His was purified from yeast cells as described (4Voisine C. Cheng Y.C. Ohlson M. Schilke B. Hoff K. Beinert H. Marszalek J. Craig E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1483-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). It was judged to be 98% pure by SDS-PAGE and staining with Coomassie Blue. Recombinant Mge1His and Mdj1His were purified from E. coli, as described (27Horst M. Opplinger W. Rospert S. Schonfeld H.-J. Schatz G. Azem A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1842-1849Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) and were 95 and 90% pure, respectively. Hsc66 and IscU were a kind gift of Dr. L. E. Vickery (University of California, Irvine, CA). Yfh1, lacking its presequence, was purified from E. coli and judged to be 98% pure (a kind gift of Dr. K. Aloria, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI). To construct an expression vector for purification of the Ssq1 protein, six histidine codons were introduced at the 3′ end of the SSQ1 protein coding region by PCR. The PCR product containing the entire SSQ1 coding sequence tagged with six histidine codons was cloned under the control of galactose-inducible promoter using the pYES2.0 vector (Invitrogen). Ssq1His was purified from a yeast strain defective in proteinase A, harboring the pYES2Ssq1His plasmid, after growth for 16 h on minimal drop-out media without uracil containing 2% galactose. Harvested cells were treated with Zymolase 20T (ICN) as described in Ref. 28Yaffe M.P. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 627-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar. Spheroplasts were lysed in a French Press at 16,000 p.s.i. in buffer L (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10% glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 m NaCl, 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100, 20 mm imidazole, pH 8.0). After a clarifying spin, the supernatant was loaded on a Ni2+-NTA 1The abbreviations used are: Ni-NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid; SPR, surface plasmon resonance. column (Qiagen) and after washing with buffer L (50 column volumes), protein was eluted by a 20–350 mm linear imidazole gradient in buffer L (15 column volumes). Fractions containing Ssq1 were collected and dialyzed overnight in buffer P (20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.8, 150 mm KCl, 10% glycerol (v/v), 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.05% Triton X-100), then loaded on a hydroxylapatite (Bio-Rad) column equilibrated with buffer P. After washing with 10 column volumes, protein was eluted with a linear potassium phosphate gradient from 20 to 220 mm in buffer P (20 column volumes). Fractions containing Ssq1 were dialyzed in buffer P and applied onto a small Ni-NTA column equilibrated with buffer P. Ssq1 was eluted with buffer P containing 0.35 m imidazole, pH 6.8. Purified Ssq1 was dialyzed to buffer K (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10% glycerol (v/v), 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.05% Triton X-100, 200 mm KCl) and stored in –70 °C. The final protein preparation was at least 85% pure as judged by the SDS-PAGE and staining by Coomassie Blue. It was not contaminated by visible amounts of unprocessed precursor form. The construction of an expression vector and the purification of Isu1His protein from yeast cells followed the same strategy described above for Ssq1, except protein having only been subjected to chromatography on a Ni-NTA column, which was 90% pure, was used for N-terminal sequencing as described for Jac1 (4Voisine C. Cheng Y.C. Ohlson M. Schilke B. Hoff K. Beinert H. Marszalek J. Craig E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1483-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). To construct an expression vector for purification of Isu1His from E. coli, the protein coding region lacking the first 35 codons (presequence determined by N-terminal sequencing) and containing six histidine codons at the 3′ end were amplified by PCR from the pYES2Isu1His plasmid. This PCR product was used to construct plasmid pET21d-Isu1M. Expression of Isu1 was induced in the E. coli strain C41 (29Miroux B. Walker J.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 260: 289-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (1578) Google Scholar) by addition of 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at A 600 = 0.6. After 3 h, cells were harvested and lysed in a French Press in buffer L containing 50 mm imidazole, pH 8.0, as described for Ssq1. After a clarifying spin, the supernatant was loaded on a Ni-NTA column equilibrated in buffer L. Proteins were eluted with a 50–500 mm imidazole gradient in buffer L (20 column volumes). Fractions containing Isu1, which were 95% pure, were collected, dialyzed against buffer K, and stored at –70 °C. The biochemical properties of Isu1His purified from yeast and bacterial cells were undistinguishable. Nfu1His protein was overproduced in yeast cells harboring the vector pYES2Nfu1His constructed using the same strategy as for the Ssq1 and Isu1 proteins. The purification procedure of Nfu1His was the same as described above for Isu1. The purity of the final Nfu1 preparation was estimated to be 90%. All His-tagged proteins used in this study were able to functionally replace untagged protein. Functionality was tested by constructing strains in which the only copy of a gene encoding a particular protein was a His-tagged version harbored on the low copy plasmid pRS316 (30Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Growth of such strains was indistinguishable from their wild-type derivatives in medium containing different carbon sources at different temperatures (data not shown). Protein concentrations, determined using the Bradford (Bio-Rad) assay system using bovine serum albumin as a standard, are expressed as the concentration of monomers. Complex Formation and Single Turnover Experiments—Ssq1·[α-32P]ATP complex was formed and purified according to the published procedure (31Miao B. Davis J. Craig E.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 265: 541-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) with some modifications. In short, Ssq1 protein (25 μg) was incubated with [α-32P]ATP (10 μCi, DuPont NEG-003H, 3000 Ci/mmol) in 100 μl of buffer S (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 100 μm ATP) at 0 °C for 10 min. The reaction mixture was loaded on a gel filtration column (NICK, Amersham Biosciences) pre-equilibrated with buffer S at 4 °C. 80-μl fractions were collected. Fractions containing the first peak of radioactivity corresponding to the Ssq1·[α-32P]ATP complex were pooled, adjusted to 10% (v/v) glycerol, aliquoted, and stored at –70 °C. An analogous procedure was used to obtain radioactive HscA·[α-32P]ATP complex. For single turnover experiments, 5 μl of Ssq1·[α-32P]ATP or HscA·[α-32P]ATP complexes was added to 15 μl of buffer S on ice containing various factors as indicated in the figure. legends, and incubated at 25 °C. At the indicated time points, 3 μl of the reaction mixture were withdrawn and mixed with 1 μl of stop solution containing 4 m formic acid, 2 m LiCl, and 36 mm ATP. This mixture was then spotted on PEI-cellulose TLC plate (Sigma) and developed in 1 m formic acid and 0.5 m LiCl. The TLC plate was exposed to a PhosphorImager system (Amersham Biosciences). Rates of ATP hydrolysis were calculated by fitting kinetic data to single exponential rise to maximum using non-linear regression as described in Ref. 20Silberg J.J. Vickery L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7779-7786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar. In the experiments where Ssq1·[α-32P]ATP complex was refractionated on a NICK (Amersham Bioscience) gel filtration column, the Ssq1·[α-32P]ATP complex was incubated as described above for single turnover at 25 °C for 10 min to achieve 50–60% of ATP hydrolysis. Then, Mge1 was added at the indicated concentrations and the contents of the reaction were loaded onto a gel filtration column pre-equilibrated in buffer S at 4 °C. 80-μl fractions were collected. Aliquots from each fraction were mixed with stop solution and developed on PEI-cellulose as described above, to determine the relative amount of ATP and ADP. 50 μl of each fraction was also counted in liquid scintillation counter to determine the amount of radioactivity associated with each fraction. Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) Analysis—SPR studies were carried out at 25 °C with a Biacore 2000 instrument (Piscataway, NJ). Purified proteins (Isu1, Mge1) were randomly cross-linked to the surface of the sensor chip CM5 by amine coupling as recommended by the manufacturer. Binding experiments were conducted in buffer R (25 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 200 mm KCl, 11 mm MgCl2, 0.005% (v/v) surfactant P20 (Amersham Biosciences)) containing 2 mm ATP when indicated, with the running buffer at a flow rate of 15 μl/min. 80 μl of buffer R containing the indicated purified proteins (Jac1, Ssq1) was used for injections. Glycerol Gradient Centrifugation—Glycerol gradient centrifugation was carried out as described (32Liberek K. Galitski T.P. Zylicz M. Georgopoulos C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3516-3520Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Purified proteins (Isu1, Jac1, and Ssq1), alone or in combinations, were placed in reaction mixtures (80 μl) in buffer G (40 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm MgCl2, 5% (v/v) glycerol) containing 2 mm ATP or 2 mm ADP, and incubated for 10 min at 25 °C. Then, 70 μl of this mixture was loaded onto a 3-ml linear 15–35% (v/v) glycerol gradient prepared in buffer G with 2 mm ATP or 2 mm ADP as indicated, and centrifuged at 2 °C in a Beckman SW60 rotor for 28 h at 46,000 rpm. Fractions (130 μl each) were collected from the top of the tube and their protein contents were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by silver staining. Steady-state ATPase Activity of Ssq1—The release of radioactive inorganic phosphate from [γ-32P]ATP was measured as described (33Viitanen P.V. Lubben T.H. Reed J. Goloubinoff P. O'Keefe D.P. Lorimer G.H. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 5665-5671Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Reaction mixtures contained Ssq1 and other proteins when indicated in buffer A (40 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm MgCl2). Reactions were initiated by the addition of ATP (2 μCi, DuPont NEG-003H, 3000 Ci/mmol) to final concentrations as indicated in the figure legends. Incubation was carried out at 25 °C and terminated at the indicated time points by the removal of a 20-μl aliquot to an Eppendorf tube containing 175 μl of 1 m perchloric acid and 1 mm sodium phosphate. After addition of 20 mm ammonium molybdate (400 μl) and isopropyl acetate (400 μl), samples were vigorously mixed and the phases were separated by a short centrifugation. An aliquot of the organic phase (150 μl), containing the radioactive orthophosphate-molybdate complex, was removed and radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Control reactions lacking protein were included in all experiments. Isu1 Is a Native Substrate for the Ssq1/Jac1 Chaperone System—To begin to test the prediction that Jac1 is a co-chaperone of Ssq1, we measured the effect of Jac1 on the ATPase activity of Ssq1 using single turnover conditions. In this assay, a complex of purified Ssq1 protein with radioactive ATP was preformed and subjected to sizing chromatography to separate it away from free nucleotides. Then, the conversion of Ssq1/ATP to Ssq1/ADP with time was determined. This approach allowed measurement of the rate of ATP hydrolysis by Ssq1, unaffected by either the rate of ATP binding to, or the rate of dissociation of the reaction products from, Ssq1. ATP hydrolysis in the presence of different concentrations of Jac1 was then determined (Fig. 1, A and B). At a 1:1 ratio of Jac1:Ssq1, no stimulation of the basal activity was observed. At higher concentrations of Jac1, stimulation was observed. However, a vast excess of Jac1 was required to effect substantial stimulation. For example, a 50-fold excess of Jac1 resulted in a 4.8-fold stimulation. Typically, binding of substrate polypeptides stimulates the ATPase activity of Hsp70s. For example, IscU protein, a native substrate of Hsc66, modestly stimulates its ATPase activity (17Hoff K.G. Silberg J.J. Vickery L.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7790-7795Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). We decided to search for potential substrates of Ssq1 by testing the ability of proteins linked to Fe/S center biogenesis and mitochondrial iron homeostasis to stimulate its ATPase activity. In addition to Isu1, the mitochondrial orthologue of bacterial IscU, and IscU itself, which has >60% identity with Isu1 (34Garland S.A. Hoff K. Vickery L.E. Cizewska-Culotta V. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 294: 897-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), we tested two other yeast mitochondrial proteins, Nfu1 and Yfh1. None of these proteins affected Ssq1 ATPase activity even when present in 100-fold molar excess (Fig. 1C). Because in other systems a native substrate and J-protein cooperatively stimulate the ATPase activity of Hsp70, we tested the effect of adding Jac1 and the possible substrate proteins simultaneously. The ATPase activity of Ssq1 was stimulated 4.9- or 2.8-fold when Jac1 and Isu1 or IscU, respectively, were both added at a concentration equimolar to that of Ssq1. When Isu1 or IscU was present at a concentration 5-fold higher than Ssq1 and Jac1, 10.4- and 8.1-fold stimulation, respectively, was observed (Fig. 1C). Moreover, we also observed, that even at substoichiometric concentrations (5-fold lower than Ssq1) Jac1 was able to stimulate Ssq1 ATPase providing that Isu1 was present in the reaction mixture (data not shown). However, no enhancement of stimulation was observed in the presence of either Nfu1 or Yfh1, regardless of protein concentration. From these results we concluded that Isu1 behaves as a native protein substrate of Ssq1, and that Jac1 cooperates with it in stimulating ATPase activity. Jac1 Binds to Isu1 and Stimulates Ssq1-Isu1 Interaction—It was previously shown that Hsc20 binds directly to IscU (17Hoff K.G. Silberg J.J. Vickery L.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7790-7795Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested whether Jac1 is able to interact with Isu1. Using purified SPR for this purpose, Jac1 was passed over the surface of a sensor chip to which purified Isu1 was immobilized by random cross-linking. The increase of refractive index (expressed in arbitrary response units) was proportional to the concentration of Jac1 passed over the chip surface, indicating a specific interaction between these two proteins (Fig. 2A). The ability of Jac1 to interact directly with Isu1 and the ability of Jac1 and Isu1 to cooperatively stimulate the ATPase activity of Ssq1, suggested that Jac1 might target the substrate Isu1 to Ssq1. To begin to test this idea, we monitored the effect of flowing both Jac1 and Ssq1 over Isu1 bound to the sensor chip. Because it is clear that physiologically important, rapid association of Hsp70 with substrates occurs in the ATP state, we first tested the interaction between Ssq1 and Isu1 in the presence of ATP. When Ssq1 alone at 0.8 μm concentration was passed over the chip surface, only a weak signal (20 response units) was detected, indicating that in the presence of ATP Ssq1 was not able to strongly interact with Isu1 (Fig. 2B). Next, we tested if the presence of Jac1 resulted in enhanced binding to Isu1. A mixture containing 0.7 μm Jac1, a concentration at which alone shows a response of only 40 response units (Fig. 2A), and 0.8 μm Ssq1 was passed over the Isu1 surface. An enhanced signal of 160 response units was observed. We interpreted this enhanced signal as evidence for stimulation of Ssq1-Isu1 interaction by Jac1. Based on general principles of Hsp70 and J-protein action, the enhancement of the SPR signal in the presence of both Ssq1 and Jac1 is consistent with Jac1 binding to Isu1 first and then promoting its interaction with Ssq1. To more directly test this idea, we tested interactions among these three proteins in solution by centrifugation of 5 μm solutions of these proteins through glycerol gradients. Upon centrifugation of either Jac1 or Isu1 alone, the peak of Isu1 was found in fractions 4–7, and that of Jac1 in fractions 6–9 (Fig. 3, A and B). However, when a mixture of these two proteins was subjected to centrifugation, a portion of both proteins co-localized to fractions 7–10 (Fig. 3C). Quantitative analysis indicated that at least 40% of Isu1 protein co-localized with Jac1. This movement of both proteins toward the bottom of the test tube was interpreted as formation of an Isu1·Jac1 complex. When Isu1 was incubated with Ssq1 in the presence of ADP, about 23% of Isu1 co-migrated with Ssq1 in fractions 13–17, indicating that Isu1 and Ssq1 could interact (Fig. 3D). In contrast, we did not detect complex formation between Ssq1 and Isu1 in the presence of ATP, as both proteins migrated during glycerol gradient centrifugation to the positions characteristic for individual proteins in the control experiment (Fig. 3E). However, when Jac1 was present at the same concentration as Ssq1 and Isu1 (5 μm each) in the presence of ATP, two separate protein complexes were detected following glycerol gradient centrifugation. In fractions 6–10, 46% of Isu1 co-migrated with Jac1 and in fractions 12–17, 51% of Isu1 co-migrated with Ssq1 (Fig. 3F), indicating substrate binding by Hsp70 chaperone. Interestingly, only minute amounts of Jac1 were visible in fractions corresponding to the Ssq1·Isu1 complex. From these experiments we concluded that Jac1 was able to bind substrate, Isu1, and subsequently target it to Ssq1, but did not remain associated with the Ssq1·Isu1 complex. Ssq1 Differs from Hsc66 in Stability of ATP Binding—Cycles of substrate binding and release are essential for the biological functions of Hsp70 chaperones. The rate of release of a substrate protein is determined by the rate of release o"

HPS results from mutations in either one of six human genes named HPS1 to HPS6, most of which encode proteins of unknown function. Here we report that the human HPS1 and HPS4 proteins are part of a complex named BLOC-3 (for biogenesis of lysosome-related organelles complex 3). Co-immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that epitope-tagged and endogenous HPS1 and HPS4 proteins assemble with each other in vivo.

Both LROs and lysosomes are formed from the trans-Golgi network and endosomes by pathways that share various common steps involving vesicle budding, maturation, translocation, targeting, fusion, and fission. The distinctive properties of LROs, however, require the existence of additional, LRO-specific events for their biogenesis.Insights into the molecular machinery involved in LRO biogenesis have been recently gained from the study of genetic disorders that affect multiple LROs in both humans and mice (1Dell'Angelica E.C.

Both the endogenous and exogenously expressed, epitope-tagged forms of human HPS1 and HPS4 co-precipitate and co-migrate with each other on sedimentation velocity and gel filtration analyses. The sedimentation coefficient and size exclusion chromatographic properties of BLOC-3 differ from those of AP-3 and BLOC-1, consistent with the existence of multiple complexes involved in the biogenesis of LROs. BLOC-3 appears to be mostly cytosolic on subcellular fractionation, although a small fraction is peripherally associated with membranes. In contrast to AP-3-deficient cells (6Dell'Angelica E.C.

These observations indicate that AP-3 and BLOC-3 mediate distinct steps in the biogenesis of LROs.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESDNA Constructs—The constructs pCI-HA3 and pCI-Myc3 were generated by cloning of annealed primers containing three copies of the HA and Myc epitope tags into XhoI-HindIII and XhoI-EcoRI sites of the mammalian expression vector pCI-neo (Promega, Madison, WI), respectively. The epitope tagging at the amino terminus of HPS1 and HPS4 was performed through PCR amplification of the full-length human HPS1 (GenBank™/EMBL/DDBJ accession number NM_000195) and HPS4 (GenBank™/EMBL/DDBJ accession number NM_022081) cDNAs, followed by in-frame cloning into HindIII-EcoRI sites of the pCI-HA3 (pCI-HA3-HPS1) and EcoRI site of the pCI-Myc3 (pCI-Myc3-HPS4) vectors, respectively. The inserts of these two plasmids were also subcloned into XhoI-NotI sites of the vector pCDNA3.1-hygromycin (Invitogen). Yeast two-hybrid constructs in the pGBKT7 (TRP1) and pGADT7 (LEU2) vectors (Clontech) were prepared by cloning of both HPS1 and HPS4 full-length cDNAs.Antibodies—The peptide sequence GKAKQKLLKHGVNLL, corresponding to residues 694–708 of human HPS4 (8Suzuki T.

Traffic. 2002; 3: 667-677Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar) have been described previously. The following mouse monoclonal antibodies were also used: anti-HA (clone HA.11), anti-Myc (clone 9E10) (Covance, Richmond, CA), anti-γ1-adaptin AP1 (clone 100/3) (Sigma), anti-GGA3 (BD Transduction Laboratories, San Jose, CA). The monoclonal rat antibody to mouse Lamp-2 (clone ABL-93) was obtained from the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank (Iowa City, IA). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies for immunoblotting were from Amersham Biosciences. Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-rat IgG, Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG, and Alexa 568-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG were purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR).Cell Culture and Transfection—The generation of cell lines derived from mouse skin fibroblasts and culture conditions for these and other cell lines have been described previously (29Dell'Angelica E.C.

Human M1 fibroblasts were stably transfected with either pCI-HA3-HPS1 or pCI-Myc3-HPS4 or with both pCI-HA3-HPS1 and pCDNA-Hygro-Myc3-HPS4 using the FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Diagnostics). G418-resistant clones expressing HA3-HPS1 (clone number 5) or Myc3-HPS4 (clone number 36) were selected using 600 μg/ml G418. The clone expressing HA3-HPS1 and Myc3-HPS4 (clone number 42) was selected using 600 μg/ml G418 and 50 μg/ml hygromycin B.Sedimentation Velocity Analysis and Size Exclusion Chromatography—Sedimentation velocity analysis was performed by ultracentrifugation on linear 2–15% (w/v) sucrose gradients (12 ml) prepared in buffer B (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm MgCl2, and protease inhibitor mixture). Cytosol (350 μl) from cells either stably (clone number 42) or transiently expressing HA3-HPS1 and Myc3-HPS4, prepared in buffer B as described (36Martina J.A. Bonangelino C.J. Aguilar R.C. Bonifacino J.S. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 135: 1111-1120Crossref Scopus (124) Google Scholar), was layered on top of a linear sucrose gradient and centrifuged in a SW41 rotor (Beckman Coulter Inc., Fullerton, CA) at 39,000 rpm for 17 h at 4 °C. Eighteen 0.65-ml fractions were collected from the bottom of the tube and analyzed by immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting. The following protein standards from Amersham Biosciences were used (Svedberg coefficients in parentheses): chicken ovalbumin (3.6 S), bovine serum albumin (4.6 S), rabbit aldolase (7.3 S), and bovine catalase (11.3 S).For size exclusion chromatography analysis, 100 μl of cytosol from cells stably expressing HA3-HPS1 and Myc3-HPS4 (clone number 42) prepared in buffer B was applied to a calibrated Superdex 200 HR 10/30 column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated and eluted at 4 °C with buffer B at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min. Fractions (0.4 ml) were collected and analyzed by immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting. Column calibration was performed using the following protein standards from Amersham Biosciences (Stokes radii in parentheses): bovine thyroglobulin (85 Å), horse ferritin (61 Å), rabbit aldolase (48.1 Å), bovine serum albumin (35.5 Å), and chicken ovalbumin (30.5 Å). Molecular mass and frictional ratio (f/f 0) values were calculated from Stokes radii and sedimentation coefficients assuming a partial specific volume of 0.72–0.75 cm3/g, as described (37Marks M.S.

Aguilar R.C. Bonifacino J.S. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 135: 1111-1120Crossref Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Horseradish peroxidase-labeled antibodies were detected by using the Western lightning, chemiluminescence reagent plus (PerkinElmer Life Sciences).Antibody Internalization and Fluorescence Microscopy—Fibroblasts grown on glass coverslips were incubated for 15 min at 37 °C in the presence of primary antibodies diluted in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 0.5% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, and 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. Subsequently, cells were washed for 5 min in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, fixed in 4% formaldehyde for 15 min, and then processed for immunofluorescence (20Brown J.A. Novak E.K. Swank R.T. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 100: 1894-1904Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Images were acquired on a Zeiss LSM 410 confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss Inc., Thornwood, NY). To detect intracellular zinc store sites, either fixed or unfixed cells were incubated for 1 h with 25 μm zinquin ethyl ester (Toronto Research Chemicals, Ontario, Canada) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle' medium containing 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin. Stained samples were washed extensively with phosphate-buffered saline and mounted on glass slides using Fluoromount G (Southern Biotech, Birmingham, AL). Images were acquired on a Zeiss LSM 410 confocal microscope using a 413-nm laser.General Biochemical Procedures—Metabolic labeling of cultured cells with [35S]methionine, preparation of Triton X-100 extracts, preparation and ultracentrifugation of detergent-free extracts, salt extraction of microsomal membranes, and immunoprecipitation-recapture were performed as described (35Dell'Angelica E.C.

Cell Biol. 2001; 135: 1111-1120Crossref Scopus (124) Google Scholar).Yeast Culture, Transformation, and Two-hybrid Assays—The Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain AH109 (Clontech) was transformed by the lithium acetate procedure as described in the instructions for the MATCHMAKER two-hybrid kit (Clontech). For colony growth assays, AH109 transformants were resuspended in water to 0.1 A 600/ml, then 5 μl were spotted on plates lacking leucine and tryptophan, in the presence or absence of histidine, and incubated at 30 °C for 4–5 days.RESULTSCo-immunoprecipitation of HPS1 and HPS4 —The possible association of HPS1 with HPS4 was investigated in M1 human fibroblasts stably transfected with HA3-tagged HPS1 and/or Myc3-tagged HPS4. The association of these proteins was analyzed by immunoprecipitation-recapture (38Bonifacino J.S. Dell'Angelica E.C. Bonifacino J.S. Dasso M. Harford J.B. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Yamada K. Current Protocols in Cell Biology. John Wiley & Sons, New York1998: 7.2.1-7.2.21Google Scholar) using extracts of M1 clones metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine (Fig. 1). In cells expressing only HA3-HPS1, this protein could be detected as an ∼88-kDa protein by the use of antibody to the HA epitope in both the immunoprecipitation and recapture steps (Fig. 1A, lane 4). This molecular mass is consistent with that previously reported for the endogenous protein (29Dell'Angelica E.C. Aguilar R.C. Wolins N. Hazelwood S. Gahl W.A. Bonifacino J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1300-1308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 30Oh J. Liu Z.X. Feng G.H. Raposo G. Spritz R.A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 375-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), accounting for the molecular mass of a triple HA epitope. Interestingly, use of an antibody to HPS4 in the immunoprecipitation step and an antibody to HA in the recapture step also resulted in the detection of the ∼88-kDa HA3-HPS1 (Fig. 1A, lane 3), consistent with the association of the endogenous HPS4 and the recombinant HA3-HPS1 in these cells. In cells expressing only Myc3-HPS4, immunoprecipitation and recapture with anti-Myc identified this protein as an ∼98-kDa species (Fig. 1A, lane 6). This apparent molecular mass was larger than the ∼78 kDa predicted from its amino acid sequence (8Suzuki T. Li W. Zhang Q. Karim A. Novak E.K. Sviderskaya E.V. Hill S.P. Bennett D.C. Levin A.V. Nieuwenhuis H.K. Fong C.T. Castellan C. Miterski B. Swank R.T. Spritz R.A. Nat. Genet. 2002; 30: 321-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), even accounting for the contribution of a triple Myc epitope, indicating that HPS4 migrates anomalously on SDS-PAGE. Importantly, immunoprecipitation with anti-HPS1 followed by recapture with anti-Myc also yielded the ∼98-kDa Myc3-HPS4 (Fig. 1A, lane 5). This demonstrated that the endogenous HPS1 assembles with the transgenic Myc3-HPS4. Similar experiments performed with cells expressing both HA3-HPS1 and Myc3-HPS4 demonstrated that these two epitope-tagged proteins also associate in vivo (Fig. 1, lanes 11–14).The endogenous HPS1 and HPS4 were also found to interact with each other on immunoprecipitation-recapture analyses of untransfected MNT-1 (human melanoma) cells (Fig. 1B). This could be shown by immunoprecipitation with anti-HPS1 and recapture with anti-HPS4 (Fig. 1B, lane 3) or vice versa (Fig. 1B, lane 6). Taken together, these observations indicate that both the endogenous and epitope-tagged HPS1 and HPS4 associate with each other in vivo. We did not detect co-immunoprecipitation of HPS1 or HPS4 with Pallidin (data not shown), indicating that the HPS1·HPS4 complex is distinct from BLOC-1.The HPS1·HPS4 Complex Is Mostly Cytosolic—To determine the extent to which the HPS1·HPS4 complex is associated with membranes, M1 cells stably expressing HA3-HPS1 and Myc3-HPS4 were homogenized in buffer A (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.25 m sucrose, 1 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 1mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitor mixture) and centrifuged for 10 min at 800 × g. The supernatant of this centrifugation (i.e. post-nuclear supernatant) was further centrifuged for 2 h at 120,000 × g, yielding cytosol (C) and membrane (M) fractions (Fig. 2, upper panel). Analysis by immunoblotting using anti-HA and anti-Myc showed that most of these proteins were in the cytosol with only a small fraction (less than 10%) being associated with membranes. These obse"

S100A4 is a calcium-binding protein that is known to form homodimers and interacts with several proteins in a calcium-dependent manner. Here we show that S100A4 localizes to lamellipodia structures in a migrating breast cancer-derived cell line and colocalizes with a known S100A4-interacting protein, myosin heavy chain IIA, at the leading edge. We demonstrate that S100A4 mutants that are defective in either their ability to dimerize or in calcium binding are unable to interact with myosin heavy chain IIA. An S100A4 mutant that is deficient for calcium binding retains the ability to form homodimers, suggesting that S100A4 can exist as calcium-free or calcium-bound dimers in vivo. However, a calcium-bound S100A4 monomer only interacts with another calcium-bound monomer and not with an S100A4 mutant that does not bind calcium. Interestingly, despite the calcium dependence for interaction with known protein partners, calcium binding is not necessary for localization to lamellipodia. Both wild type and a mutant that is deficient for calcium binding colocalize with known markers of actively forming leading edges of lamellipodia, Arp3 and neuronal Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein. These data suggest that S100A4 localizes to the leading edge in a calcium-independent manner, and identification of the proteins that are involved in localizing S100A4 to the lamellipodial structures may provide novel insight into the mechanism by which S100A4 regulates metastasis.

Cancer mortality most often results directly from metastatic spread to distal, vital organs. The isolation and characterization of molecular markers that can identify patients at a high risk for metastatic spread and consequently a poor prognosis is of obvious importance. There is increasing evidence that a member of the S100 family of proteins, S100A4 (also known as pEL-98, mts1, p9Ka, CAPL, calvasculin, and FspI), is one such molecular marker for metastatic potential with high prognostic significance. An increase in S100A4 protein expression has been correlated with a worse prognosis for patients with different types of cancer including colorectal, gallbladder, bladder, esophageal, breast, and nonsmall lung cancer (1Gongoll S.

Fodstad O. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 5490-5498PubMed Google Scholar). However, transgenic mice overexpressing S100A4 do not develop tumors, suggesting that S100A4 is not tumorigenic per se (16Davies M. Harris S. Rudland P. Barraclough R. DNA Cell Biol. 1995; 14: 825-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Instead, S100A4 can more appropriately be categorized as a potential inducer of metastasis in a given tumorigenic background. This categorization is supported by the observation that the progeny from mice overexpressing S100A4 crossed with mice overexpressing the HER2/Neu oncogene develop tumors that metastasize more frequently and more rapidly than tumors in the parental neu mice (17Davies M.P. Rudland P.S. Robertson L. Parry E.W. Jolicoeur P. Barraclough R. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 1631-1637PubMed Google Scholar).Studies to determine the mechanistic basis for S100A4 function have shown a potential role for S100A4 in several different facets of tumor progression including motility, invasion, and apoptosis (18Takenaga K.

S100A4 has been shown to be localized along stress fibers, concentrated in the perinuclear region, or at membrane protrusions (24Takenaga K. Nakamura Y. Sakiyama S. Cell Struct.

Because S100A4 has no known enzymatic activity, interactions with other proteins, both intracellularly and extracellularly, are undoubtedly critical. The putative role of S100A4 in motility has been strengthened through the characterization of its interaction with a critical cytoskeletal component of motility, nonmuscle myosin. In vitro biochemical assays have shown that S100A4 can bind specifically to nonmuscle myosin heavy chain IIA (MHC-IIA), 1The abbreviations used are: MHC-IIA, nonmuscle myosin heavy chain IIA; mAb, monoclonal antibody; pAb, polyclonal antibody; HA, hemagglutinin; VSV, vesicular stomatitis virus; N-WASP, neuronal Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein.1The abbreviations used are: MHC-IIA, nonmuscle myosin heavy chain IIA; mAb, monoclonal antibody; pAb, polyclonal antibody; HA, hemagglutinin; VSV, vesicular stomatitis virus; N-WASP, neuronal Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein. disrupt myosin self-assembly, and inhibit protein kinase C or casein kinase II-dependent phosphorylation of the heavy chain (27Kriajevska M.V.

The tumor suppressor protein p53 has also been identified as an S100A4-interacting protein and may provide a link between S100A4 and apoptosis (20Grigorian M. Andresen S. Tulchinsky E. Kriajevska M.

Other reported S100A4-interacting proteins include tropomyosin, methionine aminopeptidase, and CCN3 (cysteine-rich 61/connective tissue growth factor/nephroblastoma overexpressed) (33Takenaga K.

Pathol. 2002; 55: 250-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar).The proteins in the S100 family share the ability to bind to calcium through the use of two EF-hand motifs (36Schafer B.W. Heizmann C.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 134-140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1035) Google Scholar). Calcium-dependent regulation of S100A4 involves a conformational shift that occurs upon binding to calcium. This conformational shift is necessary for S100A4 interaction with its known protein partners. Biochemical analysis of the calcium binding event has shown that the two EF-hand motifs bind calcium noncooperatively (37Dukhanina E.A. Dukhanin A.S. Lomonosov M.Y. Lukanidin E.M. Georgiev G.P. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 403-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Based on early studies of the S100A1 and S100B proteins, it is believed that the S100-specific N-terminal EF-hand motif (site I) has a lower calcium binding affinity than the canonical C-terminal EF-hand motif (site II) (38Baudier J. Glasser N. Gerard D. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 8192-8203Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 39Mani R.S. Shelling J.G. Sykes B.D. Kay C.M. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 1734-1740Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). However, a recent study (40Dutta K. Cox C.J. Huang H. Basavappa R. Pascal S.M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 4239-4245Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) demonstrated that for at least S100A4, the N-terminal EF-hand motif actually fills with calcium first. It remains unclear whether there is a dissectible, functional relevance to calcium binding at each of the EF-hand motifs. In addition, whether this calcium-dependent regulation of S100A4 extends to other properties such as intracellular localization remains unclear.S100 proteins have been shown to also share the ability to homodimerize and/or heterodimerize with other S100 family members (36Schafer B.W. Heizmann C.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 134-140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1035) Google Scholar). S100A4 itself was shown previously to both homodimerize (41Tarabykina S. Scott D.J. Herzyk P. Hill T.J. Tame J.R. Kriajevska M. Lafitte D. Derrick P.J. Dodson G.G. Maitland N.J. Lukanidin E.M. Bronstein I.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24212-24222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and heterodimerize with S100A1 (42Wang G. Rudland P.S. White M.R. Barraclough R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11141-11146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Homodimerization is reportedly enhanced by the presence of calcium (41Tarabykina S. Scott D.J. Herzyk P. Hill T.J. Tame J.R. Kriajevska M. Lafitte D. Derrick P.J. Dodson G.G. Maitland N.J. Lukanidin E.M. Bronstein I.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24212-24222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). However, it remains unclear whether calcium binding at either EF-hand motif is essential for homodimerization. It is also unknown whether homodimerization is actually necessary for interaction with the known S100A4 protein partners and by extension, functionality.To address the functional dependence of S100A4 on calcium binding and dimerization, we analyzed the effects of site-directed mutagenesis in the two calcium-binding domains and dimerization interface. These studies demonstrate that S100A4 interaction with MHC-IIA is dependent on calcium binding, specifically at site II. Homodimerization of S100A4 can occur in the complete absence of calcium, but homodimerization is necessary for interaction with MHC-IIA. Despite the calcium dependence for association with known partner proteins, S100A4 is targeted to the leading edge of lamellipodia in migrating breast cancer cells in a calcium-independent manner, suggesting an additional level of regulation of S100A4 that is independent of calcium.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAntibodies—The following antibodies were used: mAb anti-HA tag (12CA5; produced and purified by the Antibody Facility of Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory), mAb anti-VSV tag (V-5507; Sigma), mAb anti-T7 tag (69522–1; Novagen), pAb anti-MHC-IIA (PRB-440P; Covance), pAb anti-MHC-IIB (PRB-445P; Covance), pAb anti-Arp3 (07–272; Upstate Biotechnology), and pAb anti-N-WASP (a kind gift from M. W. Kirschner, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA) (43Rohatgi R. Ma L. Miki H. Lopez M. Kirchhausen T. Takenawa T. Kirschner M.W. Cell. 1999; 97: 221-231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1062) Google Scholar). pAb anti-S100A4 (AP1178) was generated as follows. A peptide corresponding to the C-terminal 16 amino acids of human S100A4 (NH2-CNEFFEGFPDKQPRKK-CO2H) was obtained (Research Genetics) and conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (Pierce). The peptide-keyhole limpet hemocyanin conjugate was injected into rabbits (Covance), and antiserum was obtained and affinity-purified using a peptide column generated with PreACT activated resin (Novagen), as per the manufacturer's instructions.Secondary antibodies goat anti-mouse and anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to Alexa Fluors were purchased from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR) as was Texas Red-conjugated phalloidin. All chemicals and reagents were obtained from Sigma, unless otherwise noted, and all cell culture reagents were obtained from Invitrogen.Cell Culture—MDA-MB-231 cells were from ATCC (HTB-26), and 293 cells were from the Tissue Culture Facility (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory). All cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 mg/ml streptomycin.Expression Vectors, Transient Transfections, and Retroviral Transduction—Human S100A4 cDNA was isolated from an IMAGE Consortium cDNA clone (clone number 3543900) by PCR, sequenced, and inserted into derivatives of the expression plasmid pCG (44Tanaka M. Herr W. Cell. 1990; 60: 375-386Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). pCGN, pCGV, and pCGT give rise to N-terminal translational fusion protein with the HA epitope, VSV epitope, and T7 epitope, respectively. All transient transfections were done using FuGENE6 (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The T7-tagged S100A4 was subsequently subcloned into the retroviral vector pBABE (45Morgenstern J.P. Land H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3587-3596Crossref PubMed Scopus (1892) Google Scholar) and transfected into Phoenix amphotropic packaging cells to produce recombinant viruses (46Kinsella T.M. Nolan G.P. Hum. Gene Ther. 1996; 7: 1405-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar). MDA-MB-231 cells were infected with virus-containing supernatants in the presence of 4 μg/ml polybrene, followed by selection and maintenance in the presence of 1 μg/ml puromycin.Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot Analysis—Cells grown in 60-mm culture plates were harvested in 500 μl of immunoprecipitation buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 20 mm imidazole, 300 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 3% glycerol, and EDTA-free Complete (Roche Applied Science) protease inhibitor mixture. Lysates were centrifuged briefly to remove cell debris. 50 μl of the supernatant was added to an equal volume of 2× Laemmli sample buffer and represents whole cell lysate prior to immunoprecipitation. The remaining supernatant was pre-cleared using protein A-agarose beads (Roche Applied Science) and then incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with antibodies to either the HA tag or S100A4. The samples were then incubated with protein A-agarose beads for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads and immunoprecipitated protein were recovered by mild centrifugation, washed five times with immunoprecipitation buffer, and then boiled in Laemmli sample buffer. Immunoprecipitated samples and whole cell lysate samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell). Immunoreactive bands were detected by chemiluminescence (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) following incubation of the nitrocellulose with primary antibodies, followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies.Prior to harvesting the cells, in vivo calcium levels were altered by incubating cells with 5 μm ionomycin or Me2SO as a control for 3 min at room temperature. Calcium conditions were maintained throughout the immunoprecipitation by the addition of either 5 mm CaCl2 or 10 mm EGTA to the immunoprecipitation buffer used for both harvesting the cells and for all wash steps.Sequence Alignment and Site-directed Mutagenesis—Sequence alignment and analysis were performed with ClustalW software. Single and double point mutations were introduced into the full-length human S100A4 cDNA using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Desired mutations were confirmed by sequence analysis for all constructs.Immunofluorescence—Glass coverslips were pre-coated with 5 μg/cm2 collagen IV (BD Biosciences) in 0.05 m HCl and blocked with 0.5% bovine serum albumin. Cells grown on these pre-coated coverslips were fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 and then blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin at room temperature. Samples were incubated with primary antibodies against S100A4 (1:500), N-WASP (1:200), Arp3 (1:100), T7 tag (1:500), and MHC-IIA (1:5000) at room temperature for 1 h. This was followed by incubation with Alexa Fluor-conjugated secondary antibodies and Texas Red-conjugated phalloidin at room temperature for 1 h. Images were collected by confocal microscopy (Zeiss) and processed using LSM software.Peptide competition for S100A4 antibody was done by pre-incubation for 30 min with control peptide (HA-tagged peptide) or antigenic peptide at room temperature (2.5 μg of peptide per 100 μl of affinity-purified S100A4 antibody diluted 1:500).Recombinant Protein Production and Ca45 Overlay—Wild type and mutant human S100A4 cDNAs were subcloned into the pET-19b vector (Novagen) using NdeI and BamHI sites to create pET-19b-S100A4, which produces a His-S100A4 fusion protein. Escherichia coli were transformed with these constructs, and expression was induced with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Four h post induction, the bacteria were harvested by centrifugation, and proteins were extracted using BugBuster (Novagen) 10× protein extraction reagent diluted to 1× using extraction buffer containing 300 mm NaCl and 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant was applied to a TALON (Clontech) metal affinity resin column and allowed to incubate for 1 h at 4 °C. The column was then washed extensively with extraction buffer before eluting purified His-S100A4 from the resin with extraction buffer containing 150 mm imidazole.Recombinant proteins were then subjected to a calcium binding assay that has been described previously (47Maruyama K. Mikawa T. Ebashi S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1984; 95: 511-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). Recombinant S100A4 proteins, calmodulin (Sigma), and lysozyme (Sigma) were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose. The membrane was soaked in equilibration buffer (60 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm imidazole, pH 6.8) and then incubated in equilibration buffer containing 1 mCi/liter Ca45 (Amersham Biosciences) for 10 min. The membrane was then rinsed twice with 50% ethanol for 5 min. Autoradiography of the Ca45-labeled proteins was performed by exposing the dried membrane to Eastman Kodak Co. BioMax MR film for 24 h.RESULTSIntracellular S100A4 Localization—We began our study of the human S100A4 protein by generating an affinity-purified rabbit antiserum (AP1178) against the far C-terminal 16 amino acids of the human S100A4 protein. AP1178 detects a single 10-kDa band in extracts from cells known to express endogenous S100A4 (MDA-MB-231) or 293 cells transiently transfected with the human S100A4 gene (Fig. 1A). Using this affinity-purified S100A4 antibody, we examined the intracellular localization of endogenous S100A4 in MDA-MB-231 cells. These highly motile and invasive breast carcinoma cells have been shown to form tumors and metastasize aggressively in vivo. Because expression of S100A4 has been linked to these facets of tumor progression and is highly expressed in these cells, MDA-MB-231 cells are an appropriate breast cancer model system in which to study S100A4. These cells exhibit a diverse array of morphologies when plated directly on to glass coverslips. In contrast, when plated on coverslips pre-coated with collagen, the cells more uniformly exhibit a spread but polarized morphology consistent with migrating cells. We used AP1178 to study localization of endogenous S100A4 in cells grown under these conditions and observed the previously reported perinuclear enrichment. However, we also noticed a consistent pattern of intense staining at the leading edge of cells with prominent lamellipodia (Fig. 1B). To determine the specificity of this staining pattern we carried out a peptide competition assay. Pre-incubation of AP1178 with the S100A4 peptide resulted in the complete loss of intense staining at both the perinuclear region and at the leading edge of lamellipodia (Fig. 1B). In contrast, a nonspecific peptide (HA-epitope peptide) failed to abolish the staining pattern at these intracellular sites (Fig. 1B).To further confirm this intracellular localization, we established MDA-MB-231 sublines stably expressing a T7-tagged wild type S100A4 protein. Immunofluorescent staining of the parental cells with the T7 antibody yields background staining limited to the nucleus with virtually complete sparing of any cytoplasmic background (Fig. 2A). The T7-tagged wild type protein localizes to the same perinuclear and leading edge locations as observed for the endogenous protein (Fig. 2B).Fig. 2Colocalization of wild type S100A4 with known markers of leading edge formation. Parental MDA-MB-231 cells (A) and cells stably expressing T7-tagged wild type (wt) S100A4 (B–E) were plated on collagen IV-coated coverslips. Cells were then stained for exogenous T7-tagged protein using an anti-T7 mAb (A–E) and co-stained for actin with phalloidin (A and B), anti-N-WASP pAb (C), anti-Arp3 pAb (D), or anti-MHC-IIA pAb (E).

Bar, 5 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The particular cellular localization that we observed for S100A4 is reminiscent of the cellular localization of several proteins that are known to be functionally important for lamellipodial formation. To more precisely characterize the localization of S100A4 at the leading edge, we compared the localization of S100A4 to two proteins known to localize to the leading edge, N-WASP and Arp3 (48Sturge J. Hamelin J. Jones G.E. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 699-711Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 49Schafer D.A. Welch M.D. Machesky L.M. Bridgman P.C. Meyer S.M. Cooper J.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1919-1930Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). We found the wild type S100A4 to almost perfectly colocalize with N-WASP in MDA-MB-231 cells at the very tip of the leading edge of lamellipodia (Fig. 2C). Wild type S100A4 also colocalized to the same leading edge region as the Arp2/3 complex, but higher magnification microscopy clearly showed that they are in distinct compartments within that region (Fig. 2D). We were unable to determine whether the N-WASP colocalization was similarly restricted to the region and not to a specific subcompartment because of limitations in resolution seen with the N-WASP and S100A4 antibodies. The regional colocalization, however, confirms S100A4 localization at the very tips of dynamic lamellipodia as indicated by the presence of both N-WASP and the Arp2/3 complex. Given the hypothesized functional importance of the interaction of S100A4 with MHC-IIA, we also compared the localization of S100A4 with MHC-IIA. We found MHC-IIA to be more widely distributed in the cell but did find it to colocalize with S100A4 at the leading edge (Fig. 2E).Calcium Binding-dependent MHC-IIA Interaction and Homodimerization—The specific localization of endogenous S100A4 to the leading edges of lamellipodia raises the question of how S100A4 is targeted to that region. Because calcium binding and dimerization are two properties shared by most S100 proteins, these properties are obvious candidates for involvement in the observed localization. We began our evaluation of these candidates using biochemical techniques. First, we evaluated S100A4 calcium binding by testing the reported dependence on calcium binding for S100A4 interaction with a known partner protein, MHC-IIA. Using AP1178 to immunoprecipitate the endogenous S100A4 from MDA-MB-231 cells, we specifically pulled down MHC-IIA only in the presence of calcium (Fig. 3A). Although the IIB isoform of myosin heavy chain is also expressed in these cells, S100A4 does not appear to interact with this isoform (Fig. 3A). Thi"

In this study, we have confirmed the neuronal expression of HSJ1a and HSJ1b proteins and localized their expression in human neural retina using isoform-specific antisera. HSJ1a and HSJ1b were enriched in photoreceptors, particularly the inner segments, but had different intracellular localization due to the prenylation of HSJ1b by a geranylgeranyl moiety. Because of their enrichment at the site of rhodopsin production, we investigated the effect of HSJ1 isoforms on the cellular processing of wild-type and mutant rhodopsin apoprotein in SK-N-SH cells. The expression of HSJ1b, but not HSJ1a, inhibited the normal cellular processing of wild-type rhodopsin-GFP, which co-localized with HSJ1b at the ER. HSJ1b expression also increased the incidence of inclusion formation by the wild-type protein. Both isoforms were recruited to mutant P23H rhodopsin inclusions, but only HSJ1b enhanced inclusion formation. Investigation of a prenylation-null mutant showed that the modulation of rhodopsin processing and inclusion formation was dependent on the correct subcellular targeting of HSJ1b to the cytosolic face of the ER. An Hsp70 interaction-null mutant of HSJ1b had the same effect as HSJ1b, suggesting that these phenomena were independent of Hsp70 and, furthermore, overexpression of Hsp70 with HSJ1b did not modulate the HSJ1b effect on inclusion formation, showing that Hsp70 was not limiting.

Rhodopsin, the visual pigment of rod photoreceptors, is the prototypical G-protein-coupled receptor. Mutations in rhodopsin are the major cause of the neurodegenerative disease retinitis pigmentosa with more than 100 distinct mutations identified (OMIM 180380). Rhodopsin mutations can be divided into two categories on the basis of the mechanism of pathogenesis. Mutations at the C terminus of the protein interfere with its normal targeting to the photoreceptor outer segment (1Tam B.M. Moritz O.L. Hurd L.B. Papermaster D.S. J.

When wild-type rhodopsin is heterologously expressed in cultured mammalian cells it translocates to the plasma membrane, whereas rhodopsin with misfolding mutations accumulates within the cell. Misfolded rhodopsin does not acquire mature oligosaccharides, indicating it does not transit through the Golgi apparatus, and also fails to produce functional visual pigment with 11-cis-retinal (4Kaushal S.

Instead, misfolded rhodopsin undergoes retrotranslocation from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) 1The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; GFP, green fluorescent protein; DM, n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside; GGTI, geranylgeranyl transferase inhibitor-298; CFTR, cystic fibrosis transmembrane-conductance regulator. and degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome system, (9Saliba R.S.

Saturation of the normal proteolytic machinery causes misfolded ubiquitinated rhodopsin to accumulate in pericentricolar cytoplasmic inclusion bodies, known as aggresomes (9Saliba R.S. Munro P.M.

Recently, there has been much interest in the role of molecular chaperones in diseases of protein misfolding where the formation of cellular inclusions of aggregated protein is a common feature (12Muchowski P.J. Neuron. 2002; 35: 9-12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Molecular chaperones are recruited to mutant rhodopsin aggresomes (9Saliba R.S. Munro P.M. Luthert P.J. Cheetham M.E. J. Sci. 2002; 115: 2907-2918Google Scholar); however, the roles of chaperones in the biogenesis and aggregation of rhodopsin are relatively unexplored. A specialized molecular chaperone, NinaA, has been described for Drosophila rhodopsin, but a mammalian orthologue of NinaA has not yet been identified (13Chapple J.P. Grayson C. Hardcastle A.J. Saliba R.S. van der S.J. Cheetham M.E. Trends Mol. Med. 2001; 7: 414-421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). ER resident chaperones appear to play a role in the quality control of mutant rhodopsin folding and processing (9Saliba R.S. Munro P.M. Luthert P.J. Cheetham M.E. J. Sci. 2002; 115: 2907-2918Google Scholar, 14Anukanth A. Khorana H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19738-19744Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but the effect of manipulating chaperones on mammalian rhodopsin processing and mutant opsin aggregation and/or degradation has not yet been investigated. The diverse members of the DnaJ family of cochaperone proteins are characterized by a highly conserved 70-amino acid domain called the J-domain. The J-domain interacts with Hsp70 proteins, stimulating ATP hydrolysis and altering substrate binding, such that DnaJ proteins play an essential role in the regulation of the Hsp70 chaperone machine. In addition to this cochaperone function, several DnaJ proteins, including E. coli DnaJ, Ydj1 and Csp, have been shown to have independent chaperone activity in vitro (15Kelley W.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 222-227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar, 16Cheetham M.E. Caplan A.J. Cell Stress. Chaperones. 1998; 3: 28-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). Different DnaJ proteins are found in subcellular compartments including the cytosol, nucleus, mitochondria, and ER. DnaJ proteins can also be targeted to membranes by transmembrane domains or post-translational lipid modifications, such as prenylation. Prenylated proteins have either a farnesyl (C15) or a geranylgeranyl (C20) isoprenoid group attached to a C-terminal cysteine residue by a thioether linkage (17Zhang F.L. Casey P.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 241-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (1743) Google Scholar, 18Casey P.J. Seabra M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5289-5292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar). Prenylation requires the recognition of a C-terminal CAAX tetrapeptide motif by a prenyl transferase. HSJ1a and HSJ1b are human type II DnaJ proteins (16Cheetham M.E. Caplan A.J. Cell Stress. Chaperones. 1998; 3: 28-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar) that have different C termini generated by alternate splicing from a single copy gene (Fig. 1) and the mRNAs are preferentially expressed in neurons (19Cheetham M.E. Brion J.P. Anderton B.H. Biochem. J. 1992; 284: 469-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Both protein isoforms can regulate the ATPase activity and substrate binding of Hsp70 (20Cheetham M.E. Anderton B.H. Jackson A.P. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 21Cheetham M.E. Jackson A.P. Anderton B.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 226: 99-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In this study we show that the larger isoform is targeted to the cytoplasmic face of the ER by prenylation and that this localization can facilitate an interaction with rhodopsin, modulating rhodopsin processing and influencing inclusion formation. Antibody Generation and Construction of Plasmids—Recombinant HSJ1a was purified as described previously (21Cheetham M.E. Jackson A.P. Anderton B.H. Eur. J.

Rabbit polyclonal anti-peptide sera specific for HSJ1a (rHSJ1a267–277) and HSJ1b (rHSJ1b307–320) were raised against C-terminal peptides CEAAGKKPADVF (HSJ1a) and CATKRSPSPEEKASR (HSJ1b) as previously described (22van der S.J.

Subcellular Fractionation of Cells Expressing GFP-HSJ1 Chimeras—Subcellular fractionation and Western blotting to determine the membrane association of HSJ1 chimeric proteins were performed as previously described (24Chapple J.P.

Co-immunoprecipitation of Rhodopsin with HSJ1 and Hsp70 Proteins—SK-N-SH cells were co-transfected with rhodopsin-GFP and pCMV Tag3 constructs. 24 h after transfection, cells were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline and scraped into 600 μl of phosphate-buffered saline/1% n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside (DM; Sigma) containing a mixture of protease inhibitors (buffer A). Following a 30-min incubation at 4 °C cell lysates were centrifuged at 17,500 × g for 15 min. The supernatant was incubated overnight at 4 °C with anti-c-Myc (9E10) or 1D4 (National Cell Culture Center). Protein-G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) in buffer A was added, and incubation continued for another 3 h. After 5× 30-min washes in buffer A, Sepharose beads were resuspended in 100 μl of phosphate-buffered saline and levels of GFP fluorescence measured using a SAFFIRE fluorescence plate reader (Tecan Ltd, Reading, UK). Alternatively, proteins were eluted in SDS-PAGE sample buffer and subjected to Western analyses as described above for HSJ1. Co-immunoprecipitated Hsp70 was detected with BRM-22 (Sigma) at 1:1000. Quantification of Rhodopsin Intracellular Inclusions—SK-N-SH cells were transfected with rhodopsin-GFP at a 1:3 ratio to pCMV Tag3 or pCMV Tag3 HSJ1 constructs; and at a 1:3:3 ratio with pCMV tag3 HSJ1b:pCMV70 as described above. After 24 h they were treated with brefeldin A at 20 μg ml–1 for 15 min, and the incidence of rhodopsin inclusions were counted blind to experimental status (9Saliba R.S. Munro P.M. Luthert P.J. Cheetham M.E. J. Sci. 2002; 115: 2907-2918Google Scholar) and analyzed by a Student's t test. HSJ1 Proteins Are Expressed in Neural Tissues and Are Enriched in Photoreceptors—Previously it had been shown that neuronal layers of the brain contained higher levels of HSJ1 mRNAs than other tissues (19Cheetham M.E. Brion J.P. Anderton B.H. Biochem. J. 1992; 284: 469-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Human tissues were screened for HSJ1 protein expression by Western analysis (Fig. 2A) using an affinity-purified sheep polyclonal antisera (sHSJ11–277) raised against purified recombinant HSJ1a protein. HSJ1a and HSJ1b proteins were most abundant in neocortex, cerebellum, spinal cord, and retina. Both HSJ1 isoforms could also be detected at very low levels (∼100-fold lower than in cerebellum) in non-neuronal tissues; kidney, spleen, lung, heart, and testis (data not shown). HSJ1b appeared to be more abundant in neocortex and cerebellum than HSJ1a. To analyze the localization of the HSJ1a and HSJ1b isoforms within tissues we generated isoform-specific polyclonal anti-peptide sera to the C termini of HSJ1a (rHSJ1a267–277) and HSJ1b (rHSJ1b307–320). These antisera were isoform-specific as demonstrated by immunoreactivity of cells transfected with GFP-HSJ1a and GFP-HSJ1b chimeric proteins. rHSJ1b307–320 did not react with either HSJ1a or HSJ1b by Western blotting. rHSJ1a267–277 detected a single band corresponding to HSJ1a in cerebellum (Fig. 2B), confirming that this antisera (which was raised to a peptide with nine residues common to HSJ1b), was HSJ1a-specific and that the shorter alternative transcript is translated into protein. All specific immunoreactivities could be competed with the immunizing peptide. To investigate whether both isoforms are expressed in the same cell or if the alternative splicing of HSJ1 was cell-type specific, we used these antisera for immunohistochemistry of paraformaldehyde-fixed agarose-embedded adult human retina optically sectioned by confocal microscopy (Fig. 2C). Both HSJ1a and HSJ1b were detected in all layers of the neural retina; however, the staining patterns for the two proteins were distinct. HSJ1a labeling was most intense in neuronal processes (e.g. the axons of the ganglion cell layer) and photoreceptor inner and outer segments. The intracellular staining pattern for HSJ1a appeared diffuse and cytoplasmic with no nuclear staining. In contrast, HSJ1b staining was more intense in rod and cone photoreceptor inner segments than outer segments and the rest of the retina. Within the inner segments, the HSJ1b staining appeared punctuate corresponding to the protein being associated with intracellular membranes. These staining patterns were not observed with either preimmune sera, or when immunofluorescent processing was performed in the presence of the immunizing peptide. Differences in the Intracellular Localization of HSJ1 Protein Isoforms Are Dependent on Geranylgeranylation—We have not identified an established cell line that endogenously expresses HSJ1 proteins. Therefore, to further investigate the subcellular localization of HSJ1a and HSJ1b we used immunofluorescent staining of CHO-1 cells heterologously expressing HSJ1 proteins (Fig. 3A). HSJ1a was localized throughout cells with diffuse nuclear and cytoplasmic staining. In contrast, HSJ1b was excluded from the nucleus, as with the localization observed in photoreceptors the staining pattern was indicative of the protein being association with internal membranes, in particular the ER. To further analyze this we performed immunofluorescent staining of ER marker proteins in cells expressing GFP-HSJ1b (Fig. 3B). HSJ1b localization overlapped with the staining pattern of the ER lumen protein BiP and the ER transmembrane protein calnexin, as would be expected if HSJ1b were anchored to the ER. We identified a putative prenylation motif at the C terminus of HSJ1b (Fig. 1; accession number GenBankTM X63368). To test if a prenyl modification was responsible for the differences in localization between HSJ1 proteins we mutated HSJ1b's putative CAAX box at the cysteine residue where a prenyl group would be attached (C321S). The localization of GFP-HSJ1b(C321S) was identical to the localization of HSJ1a (Fig. 3C). GFP-HSJ1b(C321S) was not excluded from the nucleus and did not appear to be associated with internal membranes (Fig. 3C). Whether substrate proteins are prenylated with a farnesyl or geranylgeranyl group is dependent on the residue at position X of the CAAX box (18Casey P.J. Seabra M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5289-5292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar). The CAAX box in HSJ1b has a leucine at position X that predicts the protein will be prenylated with a geranylgeranyl moiety. Treatment of transfected cells expressing GFP-HSJ1b with GGTI (27Vogt A. Sun J. Qian Y. Hamilton A.D. Sebti S.M. J. Chem. 1997; 272: 27224-27229Scopus (169) Google Scholar) altered the localization of the protein (Fig. 3D). HSJ1b was no longer excluded from the nucleus and the membrane component of the staining was reduced, such that HSJ1b was diffusely localized throughout the cytoplasm and nucleus. The leucine at position X of the HSJ1b CAAX box was mutated to a methionine (L324M), such that the protein would be predicted to be farnesylated. The cellular localization of GFP-HSJ1b(L324M) appeared identical to wild-type HSJ1b (Fig. 3D), consistent with the mutant protein also being membrane-anchored. Treatment of cells expressing GFP-HSJ1b(L324M) with GGTI did not affect the localization of the protein (Fig. 3D). The membrane association of wild-type and mutant HSJ1 proteins was also analyzed using a well characterized subcellular fractionation (24Chapple J.P. Hardcastle A.J. Grayson C. Spackman L.A. Willison K. Cheetham M.E. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 1919-1926Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 26Chapple J.P. Hardcastle A.J. Grayson C. Willison K.R. Cheetham M.E. Invest Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2002; 43: 2015-2020PubMed Google Scholar). This fractionation generates a supernatant that is principally cytosolic and a pellet of membranes, which also contains some nuclear and cytoskeletal material. CHO-1 cells were transfected with HSJ1 constructs, following cell breakage and fractionation by centrifugation, the presence of HSJ1 proteins in supernatant and pellet fractions was determined by Western analysis with sHSJ11–277 (Fig. 3E). HSJ1b partitioned principally to the pellet fraction, whereas HSJ1a and HSJ1b(C321S) were more abundant in supernatant than pellet fractions. Collectively, these data are consistent with HSJ1b being attached to the cytosolic face of intracellular membranes dependent upon geranylgeranylation of the cysteine residue at position 321. HSJ1b and Rhodopsin Co-localize at the ER and in Rhodopsin Inclusions—As HSJ1 proteins are enriched in photoreceptor inner segments, we investigated a potential interaction between them and the major protein product of the rod inner segment, rhodopsin, in its apoprotein state (i.e. without 11-cis-retinal) and whether expression of HSJ1 proteins could modulate rhodopsin aggregation. SK-N-SH neuroblastoma cells were co-transfected with HSJ1 proteins and either wild-type rhodopsin-GFP or rhodopsin-GFP with the retinitis pigmentosa-causing mutation P23H (9Saliba R.S. Munro P.M. Luthert P.J. Cheetham M.E. J. Sci. 2002; 115: 2907-2918Google Scholar). Wild-type rhodopsin-GFP localized predominantly to the plasma membrane (Fig. 4A). P23H rhodopsin-GFP was not processed to the plasma membrane, but accumulated in the ER and in pericentriolar inclusion bodies (Fig. 4A) that have previously been characterized as aggresomes (9Saliba R.S. Munro P.M. Luthert P.J. Cheetham M.E. J. Sci. 2002; 115: 2907-2918Google Scholar, 10Illing M.E. Rajan R.S. Bence N.F. Kopito R.R. J. Biol.

A. 2001; 98: 13060-13065Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Co-transfection with HSJ1a had no effect on wild-type rhodopsin-GFP processing and no co-localization was observed between HSJ1a and rhodopsin-GFP (Fig. 4B). In contrast, HSJ1b had a dramatic effect on the localization of wild-type rhodopsin, greatly reducing plasma membrane targeting and causing rhodopsin-GFP to accumulate in the ER and in a proportion of cells in intracellular inclusions (Fig. 4B). HSJ1b co-localized with rhodopsin-GFP at the ER and in intracellular inclusions. We investigated if HSJ1b's effect on rhodopsin processing was dependent on the sequestration of Hsp70, or the disruption of another Hsp70/DnaJ protein interaction, using a point mutation in HSJ1b that is defective for binding to Hsp70. The interaction between the J-domain and Hsp70 requires a 3-amino acid (HPD) motif in the J-domain. Mutation of the histidine residue in this motif eliminates the regulation of Hsp70 by DnaJ proteins (15Kelley W.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 222-227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar, 16Cheetham M.E. Caplan A.J. Cell Stress. Chaperones. 1998; 3: 28-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). In cells expressing rhodopsin-GFP and HSJ1b(H31Q), rhodopsin was not processed to the plasma membrane and accumulated in the ER and intracellular inclusions (Fig. 4B). The effect of HSJ1b prenylation on rhodopsin processing was tested (Fig. 4B). In cells expressing rhodopsin-GFP with HSJ1b(C321S), rhodopsin localized predominantly to the plasma membrane and did not co-localize with HSJ1b(C321S). HSJ1a and HSJ1b(C321S) had no effect on the localization of rhodopsin-GFP with the P23H mutation; however, the HSJ1 staining was increased in some intracellular inclusions (Fig. 4C). HSJ1b and HSJ1b(H31Q) co-localized with mutant rhodopsin at the ER and the staining was particularly intense in intracellular inclusions (Fig. 4C). The same phenomena were observed with untagged rhodopsin (available as supplementary data). HSJ1b Is Present in a Complex with Wild-type and Mutant Rhodopsin—To investigate if HSJ1b was in a complex with rhodopsin we performed immunoprecipitation of rhodopsin-GFP and HSJ1 proteins. Immunoprecipitation of rhodopsin-GFP from a DM soluble cell lysate with monoclonal antibody 1D4 showed that HSJ1b and HSJ1b(H31Q) were present in a complex with wild-type and mutant P23H rhodopsin-GFP (Fig. 5A). Only small amounts of HSJ1a could be recovered in a complex with P23H rhodopsin-GFP, and no HSJ1b(C321S) could be detected co-purifying with rhodopsin-GFP. The reciprocal immunoprecipitation of HSJ1 proteins showed that wild-type and P23H rhodopsin-GFP could be co-purified with HSJ1b from a DM-soluble cell lysate as measured by GFP fluorescence. More P23H rhodopsin-GFP co-immunoprecipitated with HSJ1b than wild-type, suggesting that there may be a stronger interaction with the mutant protein (Fig. 5B). The mutant P23H rhodopsin-GFP also co-purified with HSJ1a. No interaction was observed between HSJ1 proteins and GFP alone (data not shown). HSJ1b Increases Rhodopsin Inclusions Dependent on Prenylation—The effect of HSJ1 co-expression on the proportion of rhodopsin-GFP expressing cells with inclusions was quantified (Fig. 6). Approximately 5% of cells expressing wild-type rhodopsin-GFP had inclusions 24 h after transfection. In cells that had been co-transfected with rhodopsin-GFP and HSJ1a or HSJ1b(C321S) the proportion of cells containing intracellular inclusions did not increase. In contrast, a significantly greater proportion (∼25%) of cells expressing HSJ1b or HSJ1b(H31Q) contained inclusions of rhodopsin-GFP, compared with control cells (p < 0.0001) (Fig. 6A). Approximately 55% of cells expressing mutant P23H rhodopsin-GFP contained intracellular inclusions 24 h after transfection. Expression of HSJ1a or HSJ1b(C321S) had no significant effect on the proportion of cells containing inclusions of P23H-rhodopsin. Expression of HSJ1b and HSJ1b(H31Q) again significantly increased the proportion of cells with inclusions (∼75%; p < 0.0001) (Fig. 6B). The Effect of Hsp70 on HSJ1b Mediated Rhodopsin ER Retention and Inclusion Formation—The HSJ1b(H31Q) mutant showed that the effects of HSJ1b on wild-type and mutant rhodopsin processing were not dependent on the sequestration of Hsp70 or the disruption of another DnaJ protein/Hsp70 interaction. However, this did not exclude a role for Hsp70 proteins in rhodopsin processing and inclusion formation or the possibility that levels of Hsp70 could be limiting in a functional cycle of rhodopsin folding mediated by HSJ1b. Indeed, Hsp70 has previously been shown to be present in mutant rhodopsin aggresomes (9Saliba R.S. Munro P.M. Luthert P.J. Cheetham M.E. J. Sci. 2002; 115: 2907-2918Google Scholar). We investigated if Hsp70 co-immunoprecipitated with wild-type and mutant rhodopsin using an antibody that detects both the cognate Hsc70 and inducible Hsp70 (Fig. 7A). No Hsp70 could be detected with wild-type rhodopsin alone, but a small amount of Hsp70 proteins could be detected with rhodopsin in the presence of HSJ1b and HSJ1b(H31Q). More Hsp70 was detected in complex with the P23H rhodopsin and this was further increased in the HSJ1b and HSJ1b(H31Q) co-transfections. The presence of Hsp70 in complex with rhodopsin was increased when HSJ1b was present, but appeared to be unaffected by the HSJ1b(H31Q) mutation, suggesting that the Hsp70 may not be binding to HSJ1b but may be binding directly to the retained and/or aggregated rhodopsin. As Hsp70 proteins are present in a complex with rhodopsin in the presence of HSJ1b, we overexpressed the inducible form of Hsp70 with HSJ1b and monitored the localization of the proteins by confocal microscopy. In the absence of HSJ1b, Hsp70 overexpression did not affect wild-type rhodopsin-GFP processing, and Hsp70 did not co-localize with the rhodopsin-GFP, although Hsp70 co-localized with rhodopsin in inclusions of P23H rhodopsin-GFP (Fig. 7B). When Hsp70 was overexpressed in the presence of HSJ1b and wild-type or P23H-rhodopsin-GFP, all three proteins could be observed to co-localize within the cell, particularly in rhodopsin inclusions (Fig. 7B). The overexpression of Hsp70 with HSJ1b did not dramatically alter the processing of the wild-type protein, as the HSJ1b mediated intracellular retention of wild-type rhodopsin did not appear to be affected in cells expressing high levels of Hsp70 compared with cells expressing low levels of Hsp70. The co-localization of HSJ1b and Hsp70 with rhodopsin-GFP, coupled to the immunoprecipation data, suggests that the proteins may be present in a ternary complex. To test if increased levels of Hsp70 modulated the increase in the incidence of inclusion formation mediated by HSJ1b the proportion of rhodopsin-GFP expressing cells with inclusions was quantified (Fig. 8). If Hsp70 was the limiting factor in completing a functional cycle of rhodopsin folding then co-expression with HSJ1b should reduce the incidence of inclusions, whereas the Hsp70 interaction null HSJ1b(H31Q) should be unaffected. Comparison of the incidence of inclusions revealed that the expression of Hsp70 had no effect on wild-type rhodopsin-GFP or P23H rhodopsin-GFP either by itself or when co-expressed with HSJ1b or HSJ1b(H31Q) (Fig. 8). These data suggest that Hsp70 was not a limiting factor in these reactions and that it has no effect on rhodopsin inclusion formation independent of HSJ1b. In the adult human retina HSJ1a and HSJ1b proteins were enriched in rods and cones. This suggested they may have photoreceptor-specific functions and/or interact with photoreceptor specific proteins. HSJ1a and HSJ1b had different intracellular localizations, which are likely to reflect differences in chaperone functions within cells. HSJ1a was cytoplasmic and excluded from nuclei in retina, but was cytoplasmic and nuclear in cultured cells. The reason for these differences between tissue and cultured cells are unclear, but may be due to HSJ1a being excluded from the nucleus in vivo due to specific interactions with other proteins. In both retina and cultured cells, HSJ1b was excluded from the nucleus and had a predominantly perinuclear localization consistent with the protein being on intracellular membranes. This membrane association was dependent on prenylation. The farnesylation of DnaJ family proteins is relatively common. Ydj1, Hdj-2, and ANJ1 are all farnesylated (28Caplan A.J. Tsai J. Casey P.J. Douglas M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18890-18895Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Kanazawa M. Terada K. Kato S. Mori M. J. Biochem.

A. 1993; 90: 8557-8561Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), and examination of the amino acid sequence of other DnaJ proteins with putative CAAX motifs predicts farnesylation. HSJ1b is the first DnaJ family protein identified as being modified with a geranylgeranyl moiety. HSJ1b was targeted to endomembranes and co-localized with the ER marker proteins BiP and calnexin. Whether HSJ1b contains any other signals that mediate its association with the cytoplasmic face of the ER remains to be determined. At the cytoplasmic face of the ER within rod photoreceptor cells HSJ1b could encounter cytoplasmic domains of rhodopsin during rhodopsin biogenesis. Therefore, we believed HSJ1b was an excellent candidate chaperone to modulate the aggregation of mutant rhodopsin. In our cell culture model, co-expression resulted in a large reduction in the amount of rhodopsin apoprotein processed to the plasma membrane and an increase in the ER localization. We also observed an increase in intracellular inclusions of both wild-type and P23H rhodopsin. These intracellular inclusions were observed to have the characteristic pericentriolar cytoplasmic localization of aggresomes (9Saliba R.S. Munro P.M. Luthert P.J. Cheetham M.E. J. Sci. 2002; 115: 2907-2918Google Scholar, 10Illing M.E. Rajan R.S. Bence N.F. Kopito R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34150-34160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Previously it has been shown that Hsp70 is recruited to opsin aggresomes (9Saliba R.S. Munro P.M. Luthert P.J. Cheetham M.E. J. Sci. 2002; 115: 2907-2918Google Scholar). HSJ1b co-localized with rhodopsin at the ER and in intracellular inclusions, we also observed a degree of co-localization of HSJ1a and mutant rhodopsin within intracellular inclusions. HSJ1a and HSJ1b both co-immunoprecipitated mutant rhodopsin. Collectively, these data suggest that HSJ1 proteins are recruited to rhodopsin aggresomes. Our findings are consistent with the expression of HSJ1b in SK-N-SH cells disrupting the proper folding of rhodopsin, such that an increasing amount of the protein enters the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. HSJ1b may delay the normal folding of rhodopsin or cause rhodopsin to misfold as a result of a direct interaction between the proteins, or represent a disturbance of the normal homeostasis of the chaperone machinery involved in rhodopsin biogenesis. Mutagenesis of the HPD motif in HSJ1b, however, suggested that the observed effects are independent of Hsp70 sequestration or an inhibition of another DnaJ protein's interaction with Hsp70. HSJ1b is present in a complex with rhodopsin when it is in the correct cellular locale and may interact directly with rhodopsin acting as a chaperone as opposed to a cochaperone. The difference between our cell culture model and the in vivo situation, where the presence of HSJ1b does not appear to arrest the processing of rhodopsin in photoreceptors, could be the result of several factors. The amount of HSJ1b at the face of ER would not appear to be the major cause, as rhodopsin retention and enhanced inclusion formation were observed in cells that expressed low levels of HSJ1b. In photoreceptors, HSJ1b may have another client protein that it binds with greater affinity than rhodopsin. Alternatively, there may be other members of the photoreceptor cell chaperone machinery that are not present at sufficient levels in the SK-N-SH cells to complete a functional cycle of rhodopsin folding in which HSJ1b takes part. Rhodopsin is continuously synthesized in huge amounts (about 10–7 molecules per day per photoreceptor) within the inner segments and then vectorially transported to the base of the outer segments. Therefore, the chaperone machinery that facilitates rhodopsin folding is expected to be highly efficient in photoreceptor cells. It is interesting to note that wild-type rhodopsin spontaneously forms aggresomes in transfected cells (in around 10% of cells after 24 h in SK-N-SHs), even in the absence of HSJ1b. These cells express much less rhodopsin than a photoreceptor, illustrating that although rhodopsin can fold normally it appears to do so far less efficiently in these cells than in photoreceptors, possibly because a specialized chaperone machinery for rhodopsin biogenesis is not fully present. In Drosophila there is a specialized chaperone, NinaA, for Rh1 rhodopsin, and homologues of NinaA have been suggested to act as chaperones for red opsin (13Chapple J.P. Grayson C. Hardcastle A.J. Saliba R.S. van der S.J. Cheetham M.E. Trends Mol. Med. 2001; 7: 414-421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). To date, however, no specific chaperone has been identified for mammalian rhodopsin. Given the enrichment of HSJ1b at the site of rhodopsin production and its ability to modulate rhodopsin folding in SK-N-SH cells, HSJ1b would appear to be an excellent candidate to participate in rhodopsin folding. Nonetheless, our data show that it cannot stimulate rhodopsin folding by itself and appears to cause a stalling in rhodopsin processing instead. This would suggest that if HSJ1b does participate in rhodopsin folding in vivo, other components of the photoreceptor chaperone machinery are required to complete a functional cycle and stimulate efficient rhodopsin folding. We examined whether Hsp70 levels were a limiting factor in this chaperone cycle by overexpressing the inducible form of the protein in conjunction with HSJ1b. Although Hsp70 did co-localize with HSJ1b and was present in a complex with rhodopsin, overexpression did not alter the fate of the wild-type and mutant rhodopsin proteins, suggesting that Hsp70 was not the missing factor. Elucidation of the factors involved in rhodopsin processing is a major challenge, but heterologous systems may be of use in reconstituting the photoreceptor chaperone machinery. The cellular processing of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane-conductance regulator (CFTR) has parallels with rhodopsin processing, and several cytosolic chaperones and cochaperones have been demonstrated to be involved in folding and degradation of CFTR. Like mutant rhodopsin, mutant CFTR is retained in the ER and degraded by the ubiquitin proteasome pathway (31Ward C.L. Omura S. Kopito R.R. Cell. 1995; 83: 121-127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1133) Google Scholar). Furthermore, when the proteasomal degradation of misfolded CFTR is inhibited the protein accumulates in aggresomes (32Kopito R.R. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: S167-S173Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). In conjunction with a cochaperone, CHIP, Hsp70 senses the folded state of CFTR and targets aberrant forms for proteasomal degradation by promoting their ubiquitination (33Meacham G.C. Patterson C. Zhang W. Younger J.M. Cyr D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 100-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar, 34Zhang Y. Nijbroek G. Sullivan M.L. McCracken A.A. Watkins S Michaelis S. Brodsky J.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1303-1314Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the farnesylated DnaJ protein Hdj-2 has also been localized to the cytosolic face of the ER, where in concert with Hsp70 it has been shown to facilitate CFTR biogenesis (35Meacham G.C. Lu Z. King S. Sorscher E. Tousson A. Cyr D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1492-1505Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Whether similar chaperone assisted pathways of folding and degradation exist for rhodopsin and other G-protein-coupled receptors still remains to be determined. However, the data presented in this study provide proof-of-principle that the chaperone environment at the cytoplasmic face of the ER plays an important role in the biogenesis of rhodopsin and other G-protein-coupled receptors. The manipulation of chaperones, in particular DnaJ proteins, has been shown to be effective in reducing inclusions and alleviating cell death associated with polyglutamine expansions (12Muchowski P.J. Neuron. 2002; 35: 9-12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). The potential for modulating rhodopsin folding and degradation through manipulation of the cell chaperone machinery could have important implications for developing therapies for retinitis pigmentosa caused by misfolding mutations in rhodopsin. It will be important to understand the specialized chaperone networks within photo-receptors and their localizations to fully exploit this potential.

Evidence exists that Gag alone is sufficient for the incorporation of LysRS into virions. Herein, using both in vitro and in vivo methods, we begin to map regions in Gag and LysRS that are required for this interaction. In vitro reactions between wild-type and truncated HIV-1 Gag and human LysRS were monitored using GST-tagged molecules and glutathione-agarose chromatography. Gag/LysRS interaction in vivo was detected in 293FT cells cotransfected with plasmids coding for wild-type or mutant HIV-1 Gag and LysRS, either by monitoring Gag·LysRS complexes immunoprecipitated from cell lysate with anti-LysRS or by measuring the ability of LysRS to be packaged into budded Gag viral-like particles. Based on these studies, we conclude that the Gag/LysRS interaction depends upon Gag sequences within the C-terminal domain of capsid (the last 54 amino acids) and amino acids 208–259 of LysRS. The latter domain includes the class II aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase consensus sequence known as motif 1. Both regions have been implicated in homodimerization of capsid and LysRS, respectively. Sequences falling outside these amino acid stretches can be deleted from either molecule without affecting the Gag/LysRS interaction, further supporting the observation that LysRS is incorporated into Gag viral-like particles independent of its ability to bind tRNALys.

Wills J.W. Coffin J. Hughes S. Varmus H. Retroviruses. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1997: 263-334Google Scholar). Upon infection of a cell by HIV-1, the viral RNA genome is copied into a double-stranded cDNA by the viral enzyme reverse transcriptase. tRNALys3 is required to initiate reverse transcription (2Mak J. Kleiman L. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 8087-8095Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The resultant viral DNA is translocated into the nucleus of the infected cell where it integrates into the host cell DNA and codes for viral mRNA and proteins. Proteins comprising the viral structure include both the glycosylated envelope proteins (glycoproteins 120 and 41) and mature proteins resulting from the processing of the large precursor protein, Gag (Pr55gag): matrix (MAp11), capsid (CAp24), and nucleocapsid (NCp7). Gag also contains C-terminal sequences for the p6 protein, which is believed to play a role in viral budding from the cell. The three viral enzymes used in the HIV-1 life cycle result from the processing of another precursor Gag-Pol (Pr160gag-pol) and are protease (PRp11), reverse transcriptase (RTp66/p51), and integrase (INp32). Both Gag and Gag-Pol are translated from the same full-length viral RNA, and this RNA, which also serves as the viral genomic RNA, is packaged into assembling virions via binding to nucleocapsid sequences in Gag (3Berkowitz R. Fisher J. Goff S.P. Krausslich H.G. Morphogenesis and Maturation of Retroviruses.Vol. 214. Springer-Verlag New York Inc., New York1996: 177-218Google Scholar, 4Geigenmüller U. Linial M.L. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 667-671Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The in vivo interaction of Gag with Gag-Pol has also been well documented (5Park J. Morrow C.D. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 6304-6313Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Smith A.J. Cho M.I. Hammarskjöld M.L. Rekosh D. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 2743-2750Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Smith A.J. Srivivasakumar N.

Virol. 1995; 69: 6106-6114Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and Gag-Pol is carried into the assembling Gag particle by its interaction with Gag protein, probably through intermolecular interactions between homologous Gag sequences. The Gag and Gag-Pol proteins assemble at the cell membrane, and during budding from the cell, the viral protease, PRp11, is activated and cleaves these two precursor precursors into the proteins found in the mature virion. The major tRNALys isoacceptors in mammalian cells, tRNALys1,2 and tRNALys3, are also selectively packaged into the virion during its assembly (9Jiang M. Mak J. Ladha A. Cohen E. Klein M. Rovinski B. Kleiman L. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 3246-3253Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Gag protein is capable of forming extracellular Gag viral-like particles (VLPs), which are made by transfecting cells with a plasmid coding only for the Gag protein, but the additional presence of Gag-Pol is required for the packaging of tRNALys into either Gag VLPs or into HIV-1 (10Mak J. Jiang M. Wainberg M.A. Hammarskjold M.-L. Rekosh D. Kleiman L. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 2065-2072Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Increasing the amount of tRNALys3 incorporated into HIV-1 results in a viral population with increased levels of tRNALys3 annealed to the viral RNA genome and increased infectivity (11Gabor J. Cen S. Javanbakht H. Niu M. Kleiman L. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 9096-9102Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In addition to the tRNALys isoacceptors, human lysyl-tRNA synthetase (LysRS), the enzyme that aminoacylates tRNALys, is also selectively packaged into HIV-1 during its assembly (12Cen S. Khorchid A. Javanbakht H. Gabor J. Stello T. Shiba K. Musier-Forsyth K. Kleiman L. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 5043-5048Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 13Cen S. Javanbakht H. Kim S. Shiba K. Craven R. Rein A. Ewalt K. Schimmel P. Musier-Forsyth K. Kleiman L. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 13111-13115Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) and is a strong candidate for being the signal by which viral proteins recognize and selectively package the tRNALys isoacceptors. The packaging of LysRS into HIV-1 appears to be quite selective. Published work (12Cen S. Khorchid A. Javanbakht H. Gabor J. Stello T. Shiba K. Musier-Forsyth K. Kleiman L. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 5043-5048Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 13Cen S. Javanbakht H. Kim S. Shiba K. Craven R. Rein A. Ewalt K. Schimmel P. Musier-Forsyth K. Kleiman L. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 13111-13115Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) indicates that human IleRS, ProRS, and TrpRS are not detected in the virion, whereas other work in one of our laboratories 2R. Halwani and L. Kleiman, unpublished work. indicates the additional absence of human ArgRS, GlnRS, MetRS, TyrRS, and AsnRS. In addition, Rous sarcoma virus, which uses tRNATrp as a primer tRNA for reverse transcription, contains TrpRS but not LysRS (13Cen S. Javanbakht H. Kim S. Shiba K. Craven R. Rein A. Ewalt K. Schimmel P. Musier-Forsyth K. Kleiman L. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 13111-13115Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). An HIV-1 population contains, on average, ∼20–25 molecules of LysRS/virion (13Cen S. Javanbakht H. Kim S. Shiba K. Craven R. Rein A. Ewalt K. Schimmel P. Musier-Forsyth K. Kleiman L. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 13111-13115Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) similar to the average number of tRNALys molecules/virion (14Huang Y. Mak J. Cao Q. Li Z. Wainberg M.A. Kleiman L. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 7676-7683Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our current hypothesis for the formation of a tRNALys-packaging complex includes a Gag·Gag-Pol complex interacting with a tRNALys·LysRS complex with Gag interacting with LysRS and Gag-Pol interacting with tRNALys. In addition to the reports cited above that provide evidence for an interaction between Gag and Gag-Pol, evidence supporting this model includes the following. 1) Whereas the incorporation of tRNALys into viruses requires Gag-Pol (10Mak J. Jiang M. Wainberg M.A. Hammarskjold M.-L. Rekosh D. Kleiman L. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 2065-2072Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the incorporation of LysRS into HIV-1 occurs independently of tRNALys packaging, i.e. it is also packaged efficiently into Gag VLPs (12Cen S. Khorchid A. Javanbakht H. Gabor J. Stello T. Shiba K. Musier-Forsyth K. Kleiman L. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 5043-5048Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), which do not selectively package tRNALys (10Mak J. Jiang M. Wainberg M.A. Hammarskjold M.-L. Rekosh D. Kleiman L. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 2065-2072Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 2) Overexpression of LysRS in the cell results in a near doubling of the incorporation of both tRNALys and LysRS into HIV-1 (11Gabor J. Cen S. Javanbakht H. Niu M. Kleiman L. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 9096-9102Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). 3) The ability of tRNALys to interact with LysRS is required for the incorporation of tRNALys into the virion (15Javanbakht H. Cen S. Musier-Forsyth K. Kleiman L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17389-17396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Therefore, the interaction between Gag and LysRS may be critical for the selective packaging of primer tRNALys3 into the virion and represents a potentially new target for anti-HIV-1 therapy. The sites of interaction between Gag and LysRS are explored in this report using both in vitro and in vivo approaches. As described above, the amino acid sequences within the viral Gag precursor that represent different mature viral proteins have been well delineated. Furthermore, the relatively high sequence conservation among LysRSs and the large amount of structural and biochemical data on aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases has greatly facilitated the design of the truncated LysRS constructs used in these studies. The crystal structures of Escherichia coli LysRS (16Onesti S. Miller A.D. Brick P. Structure. 1995; 3: 163-176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) and Thermus thermophilus LysRS (17Cusack S. Yaremchuk A. Tukalo M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6321-6334Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) have been solved. Eukaryotic LysRS is a class II synthetase, forming a closely related subgroup (known as IIb) with aspartyl- and asparginyl-tRNA synthetases (18Eriani G. Delarue M. Poch O. Gangloff J. Moras D. Nature. 1990; 347: 203-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (1192) Google Scholar, 19Eriani G. Dirheimer G. Gangloff J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 7109-7118Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The anticodon is a major recognition element for all of the class IIb synthetases including human LysRS (20Stello T. Hong M. Musier-Forsyth K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 4823-4829Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 21Saks M.E. Sampson J.R. Abelson J.N. Science. 1994; 263: 191-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). This subclass is characterized by an N-terminal anticodon-binding domain with a topology known as an oligonucleotide-binding fold, which is positioned downstream of the N-terminal extension found in higher eukaryotes. Although truncation of this extra domain (N-terminal 65 residues) does not significantly affect aminoacylation by human LysRS (22Shiba K. Stello T. Motegi H. Noda T. Musier-Forsyth K. Schimmel P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22809-22816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), it has been shown that the N-terminally truncated enzyme does display significantly weaker tRNA binding affinity. Thus, hamster LysRS was determined to have 100-fold lower apparent affinity for tRNALys when the N-terminal domain was removed (23Francin M. Kaminska M. Kerjan P. Mirande M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1762-1769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), and specific residues within the N terminus that function in tRNA binding have been identified recently (24Francin M. Mirande M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1472-1479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) This domain was proposed to provide hamster LysRS with nonspecific tRNA-binding properties. All of the class II synthetases are also characterized by an anti-parallel β-sheet active-site fold and contain three consensus motifs known as motifs 1, 2, and 3 (18Eriani G. Delarue M. Poch O. Gangloff J. Moras D. Nature. 1990; 347: 203-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (1192) Google Scholar). Motif 1 is part of the dimer interface (class II synthetases are dimers or tetramers), whereas motifs 2 and 3 together constitute the aminoacylation active site. The distribution of these different subdomains in LysRS is shown in cartoon form in Fig. 1A. Plasmid Construction—pSVGag-REV response element and CMV-REV were donated by D. Rekosh and M. L. Hammarskjold (both from University of Virginia) (6Smith A.J. Cho M.I. Hammarskjöld M.L. Rekosh D. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 2743-2750Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmids ZWt, ZWt-p6, and ΔZ-Wt-p6 were constructed as previously described (26Accola M.A. Strack B. Gottlinger H.G. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 5395-5402Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Gag deletion mutants for expression in 293FT cells were constructed by PCR amplification of the pSVGag-RRE cDNA and digested with SalI and SpeI whose sites were placed in each of the PCR primers. These fragments were cloned into SpeI-SalI sites of pSVGag-RRE. The following primers were used to construct these Gag mutants: Δ323–500 (forward primer: 5′-AATCAGTCTAGACAAAATTACCCTATAGTGCAG-3′; reverse primer: 5′-ACTCTGATCACTATCATTGGACCAACAAGGTTTCTGT-3′) and Δ363–500 (forward primer: 5′-AATCAGTCTAGACAAAATTACCCTATAGTGCAG-3′; reverse primer: 5′-ACTCTGATCAATCACAAAACTCTTGCCTTATGGCC-3′). These plasmids express truncated Gag when co-transfected with CMV-REV in 293FT cells. All of the wild-type and mutant GST-Gag plasmids were constructed using PCR. The pSVGag-RRE cDNA was PCR-amplified and digested with EcoRI whose sites were introduced in each of the PCR primers. These fragments were cloned into the EcoRI site of pGEX4t2 (Amersham Biosciences). The following primers were used to construct wild-type and mutant GST-Gag: wild type (forward primer: 5′-AATTATGAATTCCTATTATTGTGACGAGGGGTCGTTGCC-3′; reverse primer: 5′-AATTATGAATTCCTATTATTGTGACGAGGGGTCGTTGCC-3′); Δ1–307 (5′-CTCCGGGAATTCCCGCTTCACAGGAGGTAAAAAATT-3′); Δ1–337 (5′-CTC CGGGAATTCCCGGACCAGCGGCTACACTAGAAGA-3′); Δ1–378 (5′-CTCCGGGAATTCCCATGCAGAGACGCAATTTTAGGAAC-3′); Δ363–500 (5′-AATTATGAATTCCTACAAAACTCTTGCC TTATGGCC-3′); and Δ433–500 (5′-AATTATGAATTCCTACCCTAAAAAATTAGCCTGTCTC-3′). These plasmids express wild-type and truncated Gag in BL21 E. coli cells. Plasmid pM368 contains cDNA encoding full-length (1–597 amino acids) human LysRS as previously described (22Shiba K. Stello T. Motegi H. Noda T. Musier-Forsyth K. Schimmel P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22809-22816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). To construct wild-type and mutant LysRS, this cDNA was PCR-amplified and digested with EcoRI, whose sites were placed in each of the PCR primers. These fragments were cloned into the EcoRI site of pcDNA1.0 c-Myc (Invitrogen). We used the following primers: wild-type LysRS (forward primer: 5′-CTCCGGGAATTCTAGCGGCCGTGCAGGCGGCCGAGGTG-3′; reverse primer: AATTATGAATTCCTAGACAGAAGTGCCAACTGTTGTGCT-3′); Δ452–597 (5′-AATTATGAATTCCTACAGGAACTCCCCAACAAGCTTGTCAAGGAG-3′); Δ309–597 (5′-AATTATGAATTCCTAACCAACCACAAGCATCTTATGATAGAGTTC-3′; Δ267–597 (5′-AATTATGAATTCCTACTATTCAATCTCTAGGAATCCCAG-3′; Δ260–597 (5′-AATTATGAATTCCTACTAATCTAAGAAACTTCTTATATA-3′); Δ249–597 (5′-AATTATGAATTCTACTACTTAGAGCGGATGATAAATTTCTG-3′); Δ207–597 (5′-AATTATGAATTCCTAAGACAGCAGTGTGATTCATACGGAATGAT-3′; and Δ1–207 (5′-CTCCGGGAATTCTCCCTGTTTGCATATGTTACCTCATCTTCA-3′. The resulting constructs express c-Myc-tagged wild-type and mutant LysRS proteins once transfected into 293FT cells. All of the wild-type and mutant GST-LysRS plasmids were constructed using PCR. The cDNA was PCR-amplified and digested with EcoRI whose sites were introduced in each of the PCR primers. These fragments were cloned into an EcoRI site of pGEX4t2 (Amersham Biosciences). The following primers were used to construct wild-type and mutant GST-LysRS (wild-type GST-LysRS): forward primer, 5′-CTCCGGGAATTCT AGCGGCCGTGCAGGCGGCCGAGGTG-3′, and reverse primer, 5′-AATTATGAATTCCTAGACAGAAGTGCCAACTGTTGTGCT-3′. Using the same forward primer, the following reverse primers were used for C-terminal deletions: Δ506–597 (5′-AATTATGAATTCCTACTACATGGGATCATTCAGGTCAGTAT-3′); Δ452–597 (5′-AATTATGAATTCCTACAGGAACTCCCCAACAAGCTTGTCAAGGAG-3′); Δ373–597 (5′-AATTATGAATTCCTACTAGTAGGTGACCTTGTAACTGCCTGT-3′); Δ309–597 (5′-AATTATGAATTCCTAACCAACCACAAGCATCTTATGATAGAGTTC-3′); Δ249–597 (5′-AATTATGAATTCCTACTACTTAGAGCGGATGATAAATTTCTG-3′); and Δ207–597 (5′-AATTATGAATTCCTAAGACAGCAGTGTGATCTCATACGGAATGAT-3′). The resulting constructs express wild-type and mutant GST-LysRS proteins in BL21 E. coli cells. Production of Wild-type and Mutant HIV-1 Virus—293FT cells (Invitrogen) are a clonal derivative of the human kidney 293T cell line. They were transfected with wild-type or mutant Gag and LysRS constructs using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cell culture supernatant was collected 63 h post-transfection. Gag VLPs were pelleted from culture medium by centrifugation in a Beckman 45 Ti rotor at 35,000 rpm for 1 h. The pellet was then purified by centrifugation in a Beckman SW41 rotor at 26,500 rpm for 1 h through 15% sucrose onto a 65% sucrose cushion. The band of purified VLP was removed and pelleted in 1× TNE in a Beckman 45 Ti rotor at 40,000 rpm for 1 h. Protein Analysis—Viral and cellular proteins were extracted with radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mg of aprotinin/ml, 2 mg of leupeptin/ml, 1 mg of pepstatin A/ml, 100 mg of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride/ml). The viral and cell lysates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (10% acrylamide) followed by blotting onto nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Biosciences). Detection of protein by Western blotting utilized monoclonal antibodies that are specifically reactive with HIV-1 capsid (Zepto Metrocs, Inc), a polyclonal antibody for human LysRS (Pocono Rabbit Farm and Laboratory, Inc.), a monoclonal antibody for c-Myc (Invitrogen), a monoclonal antibody for GST (Amersham Biosciences), a monoclonal antibody to β-actin (Sigma), and a monoclonal antibody to C-terminal of HIV-1 capsid, which was used to detect Δ ZWt-p6 (National Institutes of Health AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program). Detection of HIV proteins was performed by enhanced chemiluminescence (PerkinElmer Life Sciences Products) using the following secondary antibodies obtained from Amersham Biosciences: anti-mouse (for capsid and c-Myc), anti-rabbit (for LysRS), anti-goat (for GST), and anti human (for C-terminal capsid). Bacterial Expression and in Vitro Binding Assay—GST-Gag, GST-LysRS, and GST control proteins were expressed in E. coli BL21 (Invitrogen). The recombinant proteins were induced with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 30 °C for 3 h. Bacteria were pelleted, washed in STE (0.1 m, NaCl, 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0) buffer, and resuspended in TK buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 5% glycerol). The suspended bacteria were sonicated for 30 s on ice. Insoluble materials were centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was used for GST-pulled down experiments. 20 μl of a 50% (v/v) slurry of glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma) were prepared as described according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences). The supernatants from wild-type and mutant GST-Gag and GST-LysRS were added to 20 μl of a 50% (v/v) slurry of glutathione-agarose beads at 4 °C for 1 h. Beads were washed twice with TK buffer plus 500 mm NaCl and once with TK buffer alone. Beads containing recombinant proteins were resuspended into 150-μl reaction volume with TK buffer. 3 μg of purified Gag (National Institutes of Health AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program) or 4 μg of purified His6-LysRS were added to each reaction. Reactions were incubated overnight at 4 °C. Beads were washed three times with TK buffer and resuspended with 40 μl of 2× loading buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS, 0.1% bromphenol blue, and 10% glycerol), boiled for 5 min, and pelleted. Supernatant (30 μl) was subjected to Western blot analysis for detecting the bound protein, and 5 μl of supernatant was used to detect GST fusion protein. Immunoprecipitation of LysRS/Gag—293FT cells were removed from the plate and washed with phosphate-buffered saline 63 h post-transfection. 293FT cells from 100-mm plates were lysed in 500 μl of TNT buffer. Insoluble material was pelleted at 1800 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was used for immunoprecipitation. Anti-LysRS was first cross-linked to Sepharose beads. 40 μl of antibody and 400 μl of 50% (w/v) protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) were incubated together in 10 ml of 0.2 m triethanolamine, pH 9. Dimethyl pimelimidate cross-linker (Pierce) was then added to a final concentration of 20 mm, and the mixture was incubated for 1 h at room temperature. The beads were then washed with 5 ml of 0.2 m triethanolamine, pH 9, and further incubated in 10 ml of 0.2 m triethanolamine for another 2 h at room temperature. Equal amounts of protein (∼200–500 μg as determined by the Bio-Rad assay) were incubated with 30-μl antibody cross-linked to protein A-Sepharose for 1 h at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitate was then washed three times with TNT buffer and twice with phosphate-buffered saline. After the final supernatant was removed, 30 μl of 2× sample buffer (120 mm Tris HCl, pH 6.8, 20% glycerol, 4% SDS, and 0.02% bromphenol blue) was added and the precipitate was then boiled for 5 min to release the precipitated proteins. After microcentrifugation, the resulting supernatant was analyzed using Western blots. Interaction of Mutant and Wild-type LysRS with Wild-type Gag in Vitro— Fig. 1 shows a schematic diagram of the domain architecture of human LysRS. This enzyme contains the three consensus sequences (motifs 1, 2, and 3) common to all of the class II synthetases as well as an N-terminal extension proximal to the anticodon-binding domain (22Shiba K. Stello T. Motegi H. Noda T. Musier-Forsyth K. Schimmel P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22809-22816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Wild-type LysRS and C-terminally truncated LysRS variants were tagged with GST on the N terminus and expressed in E. coli. The E. coli lysates were adsorbed to glutathione-agarose beads followed by three washing steps with buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 100 mm NaCl. The washed beads were then incubated in binding buffer containing purified recombinant HIV-1 Gag. The mixture was then washed three times in buffer containing 100 mm NaCl and twice in buffer containing 200 mm NaCl. Beads were then resuspended directly in SDS sample buffer, boiled, and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Western blots were probed with either anti-GST or anti-Capsid to detect Gag. Fig. 1A shows the wild-type and mutant LysRS constructs tested and lists the relative amount of Gag bound to mutant LysRS where the Gag/LysRS ratio for wild-type LysRS is given a value of 1.00. The Western blot data supporting these results are shown in panels B and C. Panel B shows a Western blot of the gel probed with anti-LysRS. The first lane represents a control experiment performed with GST alone, whereas the other lanes show the wild-type and mutant forms of LysRS eluted from the beads. In panel C, a Western blot of the same sample was probed with anti-Capsid. These data show that removal of the C-terminal 288 amino acids from LysRS (full-length = 597 amino acids) did not prevent Gag binding but further removal of an additional C-terminal 60 amino acids resulted in severely reduced binding. These data suggest that the sequence between amino acids 249 and 309 in motif I of LysRS is required for binding to Gag in vitro. Incorporation of Mutant and Wild-type c-Myc-tagged LysRS into Gag Viral-like Particles in Vivo—We next tested truncated LysRS variants for their capability to be packaged into Gag VLPs in vivo. 293FT cells were cotransfected with a plasmid coding for wild-type HIV-1 Gag and a plasmid coding for wild-type or N- or C-terminal deleted LysRS tagged with c-Myc. The expression in the cell of the different LysRS species was determined, and the results are shown in the left panels in Fig. 2, A and B. Western blots of cell lysates were probed with anti-LysRS (Fig. 2, A and B, top panels), anti-c-Myc (middle panels), or anti-β-actin (bottom panels). Anti-LysRS detects both endogenous and exogenous LysRS, whereas anti-c-Myc detects only exogenous wild-type and mutant forms of LysRS. The ratios of mutant LysRS/β-actin are similar for expression of most mutant LysRS constructs but are less than the wild-type LysRS/β-actin ratio, which was set at 1. In the cell lysate of both transfected and non-transfected cells, there is also less abundant protein species staining with anti-LysRS that has a lower molecular mass (62–63 kDa) than the endogenous LysRS (68 kDa). The smaller molecular mass species also appears in the viral lysate where its abundance relative to the full-length 68-kDa LysRS band has increased as previously reported (12Cen S. Khorchid A. Javanbakht H. Gabor J. Stello T. Shiba K. Musier-Forsyth K. Kleiman L. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 5043-5048Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The source of this species (proteolytic processing of full-length LysRS or translation from an alternatively spliced mRNA) is not yet known. The overexpression of wild-type LysRS from an exogenous plasmid (lane 5 in the upper two panels in Fig. 1A), which results in a LysRS species larger than the endogenous wild-type species because it contains a 20 amino acid N-terminal c-Myc tag, does not seem to increase the relative abundance of the 62–63-kDa LysRS species in the cytoplasm. The incorporation of the LysRS variants into virions is shown on the right side of Fig. 2, A and B, which shows Western blots of viral lysates probed with anti-LysRS (top), anti-c-Myc (middle), and anti-Capsid (bottom). Deletion of the N-terminal 207 amino acids does not affect the ability of LysRS to be incorporated into Gag VLPs, whereas the deletion of the C-terminal amino acids (207–597) inhibits LysRS packaging. The anti-LysRS used in the top panel does show a small amount of Δ207–597 incorporated into the virus, whereas anti-c-Myc (middle panel) detects none of this species in the virion. The ratios listed at the bottom of the panel use the Myc-LysRS/Gag ratio because the anti-Myc is expected to show less variability in detecting the different deleted LysRS species than the anti-LysRS. Further mapping shown in Fig. 2, A and B, reveals that a critical region in LysRS for incorporation lies between amino acids 249 and 309, i.e. C-terminal deletions not including this region do not affect packaging. Finer mapping shown in Fig. 2B shows further that a critical region for LysRS incorporation lies between amino acids 249 and 260, i.e. C-terminal deletions of LysRS up to and including amino acid 260 do not affect LysRS packaging, whereas LysRS with a C-terminal deletion up to and including amino acid 249 is not incorporated into Gag VLPs. Taken together, the results shown in Figs. 1 and 2 show that the in vitro interaction between Gag and LysRS is inhibited when the LysRS C-terminal deletion includes the sequence between amino acids 249 and 309, whereas the packaging of LysRS into Gag VLPs is inhibited when the C-terminal deletion of LysRS includes amino acids 249–260. The similarity of results obtained in vitro and in vivo indicates that the interaction between Gag and LysRS in vivo is likely to be a direct one.

https://openalex.org/W2039315315,"For a pregnancy to be established, initial apposition and adhesion of the blastocyst to maternal endometrium must occur in a coordinated manner; however, a key factor(s) that mediates the trophoblast cell migration and attachment to the apical surface of the endometrium has not been identified. In this study, we examined the effect of an endometrial chemokine, interferon-γ-inducible protein 10 kDa (IP-10), on conceptus migration to the endometrial epithelium. We first studied endometrial IP-10 mRNA expression, which was localized in the subepithelial stromal region, and detected the protein in the uterine flushing media during early pregnancy. Expression of IP-10 mRNA by the endometrium of cyclic animals was stimulated by the addition of a conceptus factor interferon-tau (IFN-τ). Immunofluorescent analysis revealed that IP-10 receptor, CXCR3, was localized in the trophoblast cells, to which biotinylated-recombinant caprine IP-10 (rcIP-10) bound. Chemotaxis assay indicated that rcIP-10 stimulated the migration of trophoblast cells, and the effects of rcIP-10 were neutralized by the pretreatment with an anti-IP-10 antibody. Adhesive activity of trophoblast cells to fibronectin was promoted by rcIP-10, and the effect was inhibited by the use of anti-IP-10 antibody. Further adhesion experiments demonstrated that binding of trophoblast cells to fibronectin was completely inhibited by a peptide of the Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) sequence, which binds to integrins α5β1, αVβ1, αVβ3, and αVβ5, whereas non-binding peptide containing Arg-Gly-Glu (RGE) had minimal effects. More importantly, rcIP-10 promoted the adhesion of trophoblast cells to primary cells isolated from endometrial epithelium. Furthermore, rcIP-10 stimulated the expression of integrin α5, αV, and β3 subunit mRNA in trophoblast cells. These findings suggest that endometrial IP-10 regulates the establishment of apical interactions between trophoblast and epithelial cells during early gestation.

Implantation requires closely harmonized processes of apposition, attachment, and adhesion of the conceptus to the maternal endometrium and is completed when an initial formation of the placenta between the conceptus and endometrium is established. In the ruminant ungulates, interferon-τ (IFN-τ), 1The abbreviations used are: IFN, interferon; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; ECM, extracellular matrix; LSM, least square means; IP-10, interferon γ-inducible protein 10 kDa. secreted by the trophoblast cells, plays a role in the process of maternal recognition of pregnancy (1Imakawa K.

Med. 1992; 200: 7-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). When IFN-τ production is highest between days 15 and 18 of gestation, the elongated conceptus reaches a point of attachment in utero, and fuses with endometrial epithelial cells, which undergoes the developmental changes, resulting in the formation of a noninvasive synepitheliochorial placenta (3Wooding F.B.P. Placenta. 1992; 13: 101-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). When the conceptus attachment begins, physical interactions are established between the tips of the endometrial microvilli and the trophoblast cells, which involve changes in the expression of cell adhesion molecules and extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins (4MacLaren L.A. Wildeman A.G. Biol. Reprod. 1995; 53: 153-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 5Johnson G.A. Bazer F.W. Jaeger L.A. Ka H. Garlow J.E. Pfarrer C. Spencer T.E. Berghardt R.C. Biol.

The expression of integrins on endometrial luminal epithelium changes during the estrous cycle, and such expressions on uterine surface and embryonic trophectoderm also change during gestation. In addition, the increase in integrin expressions on the trophectoderm during the early pregnancy is required for initial and/or firm adhesion of the conceptus to endometrial cells. However, a key factor(s) that mediates the trophoblast cell migration and attachment to the apical surface of endometrium has not been identified. Recently, we demonstrated that a chemokine, interferon-γ-inducible protein 10 kDa (IP-10), was expressed in the pregnant ovine endometrium, and the endometrial tissue expression of IP-10 in vitro was stimulated by the addition of conceptus factor IFN-τ (7Nagaoka, K., Sakai, A., Nojima, H., Suda, Y., Yokomizo, Y., Imakawa, K., Sakai, S., and Christenson, R. K. Biol. Reprod., 68, 1413–1421Google Scholar). Chemokines are a family of structurally related low molecular mass cytokines and play a key role in the migration and activation of different subpopulations of leukocytes (8Mackay C. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 95-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar). Four subfamilies, designated C, CC, CXC, and CX3C chemokines, are identified based on the relative positions of conserved cysteine residues (9Rossi D. Zlotnik A. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 217-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (2101) Google Scholar). IP-10, belongs to the CXC chemokine subfamily, is induced in a variety of cell types (10Baggiolini M. Dewald B. Moser B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 675-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (1987) Google Scholar), and regulates multiple aspects of inflammatory and immune responses primarily through chemotactic activity toward subsets of leukocytes (11Luster A. Unkeless J. Ravetch J. Nature. 1985; 315: 672-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar). IP-10 targets the receptor CXCR3 and activates several subsets of leukocytes, NK cells, Th1 lymphocytes, eosinophils and dendritic cells (12Inngjerdingen M. Damaj B. Maghazachi A.A.

These chemokines are thought to play an important role in cellular movement and positioning of leukocytes, which infiltrate into the subepithelial stromal regions of the uterus. It has been suspected that distribution and/or redistribution of leukocytes, regulated by chemokines expressed in utero in a spatial-temporal manner, is necessary for the establishment of immunological environments suitable for implantation and subsequent development. It is known that non-hematopoietic tumor cells exhibit specific patterns of metastasis to other organs, suggesting that tumor cells do not migrate randomly. One explanation for this phenomenon is that the migration of tumor cells may be determined by interactions between particular chemokines and specific receptors at target organs (24Muller A. Homey B. Soto H. Ge N. Catron D. Buchanan M.E. McClanahan T. Murphy E. Yuan W. Wagner S.N. Barrera J.L. Mohar A. Verastegui E. Zlotnik A.

It has been reported that some chemokine receptor transcripts are detected in human and mouse non-hematopoietic trophoblast cells (26Athanassakis I. Papadimitrious L. Koumantakis E. Vassiliadis S. Hum. Immunol. 2000; 61: 651-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 27Douglas G.C. Thirkill T.L. Sideris V. Rabieh M. Trollinger D. Nuccitelli R. J. Reprod.

These observations lead us to postulate that interactions between chemokines and their receptors modulate trophoblast migration to the endometrium. Moreover, chemokines may stimulate the integrin-dependent adhesion of trophoblast cells to the apical surface of endometrium because chemokines are also known as physiological activators of rapid integrin-dependent leukocytes arrest on endothelial cells (29Butcher E.C. Williams M. Youngman K. Rott L. Briskin M. Adv. Immunol. 1999; 72: 209-253Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, it is unclear whether endometrial IP-10, stimulated by conceptus factor IFN-τ, modulates the migration and adhesion of trophoblast cells to the endometrium in ruminants. In the present study, we assessed a putative role that IP-10/CXCR3 plays within the uterus during early pregnancy in ruminants. To study a role of IP-10/CXCR3 for engagement of the conceptus and endometrium, temporal expression of IP-10 and CXCR3 within the uterus of Shiba goats was examined. Whether the interaction between IP-10 and CXCR3 could mediate trophoblast cell migration and adhesion to the apical surface of endometrium was then determined. Examination is extended to identify which integrin subunits and ECMs were involved in the trophoblast cell adhesion to the endometrium through the IP-10/CXCR3 signaling. Animals and Tissue Preparation—Shiba goats were maintained at the University of Tokyo farm and the protocol for goat experimentation was reviewed and approved by the Animal Care Committee at the university. Uteri from cyclic goats on days 14 (n = 9) and 17 (n = 3) and pregnant goats on days 14 (n = 6), 17 (n = 9), and 20 (n = 3) were removed by hysterectomy under isoflurane anesthesia. Whole uteri from day 14 cyclic and days 14 and 17 pregnant animals (n = 3 each) were frozen for in situ hybridization analysis (7Nagaoka, K., Sakai, A., Nojima, H., Suda, Y., Yokomizo, Y., Imakawa, K., Sakai, S., and Christenson, R. K. Biol. Reprod., 68, 1413–1421Google Scholar). Uteri from days 14 and 17 pregnant and days 14 and 17 cyclic animals were subjected to uterine flushing procedure for the isolation of conceptuses and/or collection of flushed media. PBS (15 ml) was gently flushed into the uterus, and the uterine flushing media collected were concentrated (Macrosep, Pall Corporation, East Hills, NY) and subjected to the Western blot analysis for the detection of IP-10. Conceptus tissues collected from days 14 (n = 3, whole conceptus), 17 (n = 3, approximately one half of conceptus, 200 mg each) and 20 (n = 3, trophoblast region only) of pregnant animals were subjected to in vitro culture, the remaining days 17 and 20 conceptus tissues were frozen for subsequent RNA extraction and immunostaining. The in vitro culture media were subjected to Western blot analysis for the determination of IFN-τ. Uteri from day 14 cyclic animals (n = 3) were used for epithelial cell isolation. Endometrial explants from day 14 cyclic goats (n = 3) were cultured to examine the stimulatory effect of IFN-τ on IP-10 production. Endometrial tissues of goats (n = 3 for each day examined) from which conceptuses had been removed were frozen and subjected to RNA extraction. In Vitro Culture—Whole conceptuses (day 14, n = 3) and minced conceptuses (days 17 and 20, ∼200 mg/culture dish, n = 3 each) were cultured under conditions essentially described previously (30Imakawa K. Tamura K. McGuire W.J. Khan S. Harbison L.A. Stanga J.P. Helmer S.D. Christenson R.K. Endocrine. 1995; 3: 511-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The procedures for endometrial epithelial cell dissociation and subsequent characterization were previously described (31Takahashi H. Iga K. Sato T. Takahashi M. Okano A. J. Reprod. Dev. 2001; 47: 181-187Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Uterine horns from three day 14 cyclic goats were filled with 0.76% EDTA-PBS and preincubated at 37 °C for 1 h. The endometrial epithelium was scraped off by a surgical blade and then incubated at 37 °C for 8 min in 0.1% collagenase (Sigma). The cell suspension was passed through a nylon mesh (70 μm) and subjected to density gradient centrifugation. Collected epithelial cells were resuspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and Ham's F-12 (DMEM/Ham's F-12, Sigma) supplemented with 40 units/ml of penicillin, 40 μg/ml, of streptomycin and 10% fetal calf serum. The cells were then plated in 24-well dishes coated with swine-skin type I collagen (Nitta gelatin, Osaka, Japan) and subjected to the adhesion assay when the cells had grown to confluent. Dissociated cells were also prepared from day 17 goat conceptuses. These conceptuses (n = 3) were dissected into small pieces and incubated in 0.2% collagenase (Sigma) at 37 °C for 30 min. The cells were passed through a nylon mesh (70 μm) and resuspended in DMEM with antibiotics, which were immediately used for chemotaxis or adhesion assays. In addition, bovine B cells (KU-1, Ref. 32Koyama H. Imamura Y. Yoshikawa H. Kajikawa O. Itohara S. Mizuno Y. Yoshikawa T. Saito H. J. Vet. Med. B. 1986; 33: 586-596Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar) and caprine trophoblast clone cells (HTS-1, Ref. 33Miyazaki H. Imai M. Hirayama T. Saburi S. Tanaka M. Maruyama M. Matsuo C. Meguro H. Nishibashi K. Inoue F. Djiane J. Gertler A. Tachi S. Imakawa K. Tachi C. Placenta. 2002; 23: 613-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10–20% fetal calf serum and antibiotics. Endometrial tissues (∼600 mg wet weight/culture dish) from day 14 cyclic goats (n = 3) were cultured in 20 ml of DMEM supplemented with antibiotics, and were treated with 5 nm recombinant bovine IFN-τ (rbIFN-τ, Katakura Industries, Inc., Tokyo, Japan). After 24 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2 atmosphere, endometrial tissues were frozen separately and stored at –70 °C for subsequent RNA extraction and Northern blot analyses. Cloning of Caprine IP-10 and CXCR3 cDNAs—Through the use of RT-PCR, caprine IP-10 and CXCR3 cDNAs were amplified from caprine endometrial RNA and subcloned into a pSTBlue vector (TaKaRa, Tokyo, Japan), which was then subjected to an automated sequence analysis using a PerkinElmer sequencer (model ABI Prism 377 XL, Roche Applied Science). Nucleotide sequence comparisons of caprine IP-10 and CXCR3 were performed using the BLAST network program (National Center for Biotechnology Information, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) and GenBank™ accession numbers were obtained (AB099892 and AB099893, respectively). Transfection of CXCR3 Expression Plasmid—The nucleotide sequence encoding the open reading frame of caprine CXCR3 was PCR-amplified and cloned into a mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen Corp., Carlsbad, CA). This plasmid was transfected into KU-1 and HTS-1 cells by using Transfast™ (Promega, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Two days after transfection, cells were used for chemotaxis or adhesion assay. Production of Recombinant Caprine IP-10 and the Antibody—The nucleotide sequence encoding the mature region of caprine IP-10 (cIP-10) cDNA was PCR-amplified and cloned into an expression plasmid, pET-14b (Novagen, Madison, WI), which consisted of a histidine tag at the N-terminal side of cIP-10. This expression vector, pET-14b-cIP-10, was used to transform Escherichia coli BL21-SI (Invitrogen) cells, which were grown overnight. These cells were harvested, resuspended in 50 mm NaH2PO4, 500 mm NaCl, and 10 mm imidazole (pH 7.4), and disrupted on ice by sonication. After cell debris and insoluble proteins were removed by centrifugation, recombinant cIP-10 (rcIP-10) in the supernatant was examined using SDS-PAGE. Recombinant cIP-10 was purified using a nickel-chelating column (Hi-trap Chelating HP, Amersham Biosciences) on the chromatography system (AKTA, Amersham Biosciences). The protein was eluted from the column with a linear gradient of imidazole (20–500 mm), which was then dialyzed against PBS to remove imidazole. 200 μg of rcIP-10 proteins in PBS were mixed with Freund's complete adjuvant (Sigma) and injected sc into rabbits (n = 2). Recombinant proteins were injected two more times biweekly. A titer was checked 1 week after the last injection, and blood was collected on the following day. Anti-caprine IP-10 antibody was purified from antiserum using Hitrap Protein G column (Amersham Biosciences). SDS-PAGE and Western Blot Analysis—After determining protein concentrations using protein assay kit II (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA), culture media (3–8 μl, 10 μg of protein/lane, n = 3), concentrated uterine flushing media (10 μg of protein/lane, n = 3 for each day), or recombinant IP-10 (50 or 200 ng/lane) were subjected to Western blot analysis as described previously (7Nagaoka, K., Sakai, A., Nojima, H., Suda, Y., Yokomizo, Y., Imakawa, K., Sakai, S., and Christenson, R. K. Biol. Reprod., 68, 1413–1421Google Scholar). In brief, protein samples were boiled for 5 min in the SDS sample buffer, electrophoresed on 10 or 15% SDS-PAGE gels under reducing conditions, and the gel was stained with Coomassie Blue. For Western blot analysis, proteins in the gel were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Immobilon, Millipore, Bedford, MA). The membranes were blocked with Block Ace (Dainippon Pharmaceutical, Osaka, Japan) at room temperature for 1 h and then incubated with a rabbit polyclonal antibody to ovine IFN-τ (1:5000, a gift from Dr. Bazer), histidine tag (Sigma), or caprine IP-10 (1:1000) at 4 °C for 12 h. After incubation, membranes were washed three times in TBS-Tween 20, incubated with donkey anti-rabbit IgG-conjugated with horseradish peroxidases (Amersham Biosciences) at room temperature for 1 h, and washed three times in TBS-Tween 20. The bands were detected using ECL Western blotting detection reagents (Amersham Biosciences). RT-PCR Analysis—Using Isogen (Nippon Gene, Tokyo, Japan), total RNAs were extracted from endometrial and conceptus tissues and cultured cells (n = 3 each). Total RNA samples were first reverse-transcribed with SuperScriptII (Invitrogen) and oligo(dT) primers (20 μl of reaction volume). Amounts of CXCR3, XCR1 and the integrin receptor mRNAs were determined from PCR amplification using oligonucleotide primers (Table I). Each reaction consisting of primer pairs was run with RT template (1 μl) and AmpliTaq Gold (0.625 units; Roche Applied Science) in a final volume of 25 μl. All PCR reactions consisted of 40 cycles at 94 °C for 1 min, 60 °C for 1 min and 72 °C for 1 min, followed by the final extension at 72 °C for 12 min. Following agarose gel electrophoresis and visualization with ethidium bromide, PCR products were quantified by using an image analysis system (ATTO Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with the Quantity One (v3.0 software; PDI, Inc., Huntington Station, NY).Table IOligonucleotide primers used for PCR reactionsNameSequence of foward and reverse primerLengthbpCXCR35′-GCATCAGCTTCGATCGGTAC-3′2835′-GATGCGGGCGTAGCAATAGG-3′XCR15′-ATGGAGCCCTCAGACATCCC-3′6275′-GAGGATCTCCACGTAGCAGA-3′Integrin α55′-TGCTGTGAACCAGAGTCGTC-3′8095′-ATCCACTGCACAGCTGTGGC-3′Integrin αV5′-GAAGCAGGAAAGAGAGCCTG-3′8905′-CTATATCCGTGGCTCCTTTC-3′Integrin β15′-CTCAAATCCAGCCACAGCAG-3′5235′-CCAGCGAAGTGAAACACAGC-3′Integrin β35′-AGATTGGAGACACGGTGAGC-3′3925′-GTACTTGAAAGTGATCTTGC-3′Integrin β55′-GTCTGAAGATTGGGGACAGC-3′2855′-GGTACACGCTCTGGTTCTCC-3′G3PD115′-ATGGGGAAGGTGAAGGTCGG-3′1505′-ATCATATTGGAACATGTAAA-3′ Open table in a new tab Northern Blot Analysis—Northern blot analysis was performed as described previously (7Nagaoka, K., Sakai, A., Nojima, H., Suda, Y., Yokomizo, Y., Imakawa, K., Sakai, S., and Christenson, R. K. Biol. Reprod., 68, 1413–1421Google Scholar). DIG-labeled cRNA probes were generated from IP-10 and CXCR3 cDNA plasmids by using T7 or SP6 RNA polymerase (Promega). Total RNAs were used for the determination of IP-10 mRNA whereas poly(A)+ RNA was used to examine CXCR3 mRNA. Poly(A)+ RNA was obtained from total RNA that had been isolated from PBMCs using Oligotex-dT30 (TaKaRa) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Total RNAs (20 μg/lane, n = 3 each) or poly (A)+ RNAs (2 μg/lane, n = 3 each) were separated by electrophoresis and transferred to a nylon membrane (Biodyne-B; Pall Corporation). The membrane was hybridized with cRNA probe at 63 °C for 12 h. After hybridization, the signals were detected using the DIG detection systems (7Nagaoka, K., Sakai, A., Nojima, H., Suda, Y., Yokomizo, Y., Imakawa, K., Sakai, S., and Christenson, R. K. Biol. Reprod., 68, 1413–1421Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence—Frozen conceptus tissues sectioned (10 μm, n = 3 for each day examined) were mounted onto silan-coated slides and fixed in acetone. Nonspecific binding was blocked by a treatment with Block Ace at room temperature for 1 h, and slides were then incubated with a mouse monoclonal antibody to human CXCR3 (10 μg/ml, R&D Systems Inc., Minneapolis, MN) or normal mouse IgG (Sigma) at 4 °C for 12 h. After the primary antibody incubation, slides were treated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (15 μg/ml, Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories Inc., West Grove, PA) at room temperature for 1 h. Nuclei were stained with propidium iodide (2 μg/ml, Sigma). The slides were examined and digital images were captured on a confocal laser scanning microscope (FV300, OLYMPUS, Tokyo, Japan). Protein Biotinylation and Detection—Recombinant cIP-10 protein was biotinylated by EZ-link biotinylation reagent (Pierce). As a control, recombinant GST and recombinant caprine lymphotactin-GST protein 2K. Imakawa, unpublished data. were also labeled with biotin. Proteins were incubated with 1 ml of 0.3 mg/ml EZ-link biotinylation reagent in PBS on ice for 2 h. After incubation, samples were dialyzed to remove the free biotin and measured their protein concentrations. For labeling efficiency conformation, biotinylated proteins (2 μg/lane) were resolved on 15% SDS-PAGE gels under reducing condition and visualized by streptavidin-horseradish peroxidases (Amersham Biosciences). Frozen conceptus tissues sectioned (10 μm, n = 3 each) were mounted onto silan-coated slides and fixed in acetone. Slide sections were blocked with Block Ace at room temperature for 1 h and then incubated with biotinylated protein (100 μg/ml) at room temperature for 1 h. After incubation, slides were incubated with streptavidin-horseradish peroxidases (1:5000, Amersham Biosciences) at room temperature for 1 h. The biotinylated protein bound to the tissues was visualized with DAB solutions (Sigma). Tissue sections were then counterstained with hematoxylin. Chemotaxis Assay—Migration of KU-1, HTS-1, or primary trophoblast cells was assessed in a 96 well-modified Boyden chamber (Neuro-Probe, Cabin John, MD) using polyvinylpyrrolidone-free polycarbonate membrane (5 μm pore size, NeuroProbe), which had been coated with 10 μg/ml bovine plasma fibronectin (Wako Junyaku, Osaka, Japan) for 2 h. The assay was performed as described (7Nagaoka, K., Sakai, A., Nojima, H., Suda, Y., Yokomizo, Y., Imakawa, K., Sakai, S., and Christenson, R. K. Biol. Reprod., 68, 1413–1421Google Scholar). In brief, DMEM-0.1% bovine serum albumin (without phenol red or fetal calf serum) supplemented with indicated concentrations of rcIP-10 was added to the bottom wells of the chemotaxis chamber, whereas cells (5 × 106 cells/ml) in DMEM, 0.1% bovine serum albumin (without phenol red and fetal calf serum) were added to the top wells of the chamber. After the chambers were incubated at 37 °C and 5% CO2 atmosphere for 2 h, the membranes were removed, washed with PBS, fixed, and stained with Dif-Quick (Kokusai Shiyaku, Kobe, Japan). The number of cells that migrated to the lower surface was microscopically counted at six randomly chosen high power fields. For the blocking experiments, before addition to the bottom chamber, rcIP-10 was preincubated at 37 °C for 1 h with 30 μg/ml of anti-IP-10 antibody or control rabbit IgG (Sigma). Three replicates were performed for each treatment, and three independent experiments were done for each treatment. Adhesion Assay—24-well plates were coated with type I collagen (Nitta gelatin) or fibronectin at a concentration of 10 μg/ml at room temperature for 2 h, or plated with caprine epithelial cells. Following three washes with PBS, the plates were blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin at room temperature for 30 min. HTS-1 or primary trophoblast cells were labeled with the intracellular fluorescent dye, 4 μm calsein-AM (Molecular Probes Inc., Eugene, OR) at 37 °C for 30 min. Following three washes with PBS, cells were incubated with the indicated concentrations of rcIP-10 at 37 °C for 1 h, and the cells were then added to each well, and the plates were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. After incubation, unbound cells were removed by three washes with PBS, and the remaining cells were treated with 1% Triton X-100, 10% ethanol in PBS. Fluorescence of cells was measured using a fluorescence reader (excitation filter 485 nm and emission filter 535 nm) (ARVO™ SX 1420 Multilabel Counter, PerkinElmer Life Sciences Inc.). For the blocking experiments, rcIP-10 protein had been preincubated at 37 °C for 1 h with 30 μg/ml of anti-IP-10 antibody or control rabbit IgG (Sigma). To further investigate the involvement of IP-10 on cell adhesion to fibronectin, the Gly-Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser-Pro-Lys (GRGDSPK, Sigma) synthetic peptide at a concentration of 50 mm, its control, Arg-Gly-Glu-Ser (RGES, Sigma), or 5 mm EDTA was preincubated with cells and rcIP-10 protein. Three replicates were examined for each treatment, and three independent experiments were performed for each substrate and treatment. Statistical Analysis—Measurements of optical density (Western blot) and light intensity (RT-PCR) were subjected to least squares (LS) ANOVA, which employed the general linear models procedures of the Statistical Analysis System (version 6.0; SAS Institute, Cary, NC). The light intensity from G3PDH PCR products was used as covariates for RT-PCR analyses. In chemotaxis assays, the number of cells migrated or attached with a treatment was calculated as the number relative to the cells without any treatment, which was then analyzed statistically as aforementioned. The model used in the LS-ANOVA inclu"
https://openalex.org/W2099428800,"In the present study, we examined regulation of activated focal adhesion kinase localization in focal adhesions. By using focal adhesion kinase fused to an inert transmembrane anchor, we found that the focal contact targeting region within focal adhesion kinase was preserved in the membrane-targeted fusion protein. However, upon tyrosine phosphorylation, full-length focal adhesion kinase became excluded from focal adhesions. This negative regulation of localization could be abolished by mutating key amino acid residues of focal adhesion kinase shown previously to be involved in adhesion-mediated signal transduction. Hyper-phosphorylation of endogenous focal adhesion kinase induced by pervanadate resulted in a similar reduction of localization at focal adhesions. We also show here that Src family kinases are essential for the phosphorylation-dependent exclusion of focal adhesion kinase from focal adhesions. We propose here a molecular model for the tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent regulation of focal adhesion kinase organization involving Src kinases and an inhibitory phosphorylation of the C-terminal (Tyr-925) tyrosine residue.

FAK phosphorylation following adhesion depends on its association with Src family kinases, leading to the formation of multimolecular signaling complexes in which FAK serves as a scaffold (5Schlaepfer D.D. Hanks S.K. Hunter T. van der Geer P. Nature. 1994; 372: 786-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (1448) Google Scholar, 6Schaller M.D. Biochim. Biophys.

Following activation, residue Tyr-397 of FAK becomes auto-phosphorylated, resulting in the formation of an SH2-docking site (5Schlaepfer D.D. Hanks S.K. Hunter T. van der Geer P. Nature. 1994; 372: 786-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (1448) Google Scholar). Src family kinases then associate with Tyr-397 and phosphorylate several other tyrosine residues in FAK, including Tyr-925 that resides within the focal adhesion targeting (FAT) sequence at the FAK C terminus (5Schlaepfer D.D. Hanks S.K. Hunter T. van der Geer P. Nature. 1994; 372: 786-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (1448) Google Scholar). The adaptor protein Grb2 then binds phosphorylated Tyr-925 and forms a signaling complex that includes the nucleotide exchange factor Sos and the small GTP-binding protein Ras (5Schlaepfer D.D. Hanks S.K. Hunter T. van der Geer P. Nature. 1994; 372: 786-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (1448) Google Scholar). This sequence of events contributes to activation of the ERK1/2 response (5Schlaepfer D.D. Hanks S.K. Hunter T. van der Geer P. Nature. 1994; 372: 786-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (1448) Google Scholar). Two additional pathways lead to FAK-mediated activation of ERK1/2: one involves binding of the adaptor protein p130Cas to the prolinerich region of FAK via an SH3 domain interaction, and the second is the result of FAK association with the adaptor protein Shc (8Gu J.

Biol. 2001; 21: 7641-7652Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The mechanisms that underlie FAK activation are not yet clear. Although FAK lacks any myristoylation or farnesylation signals, membrane translocation of FAK could be initiated by direct association with the β1 integrin tail (11Frisch S.M. Vuori K. Ruoslahti E. Chan-Hui P.Y. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 793-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (1003) Google Scholar). Close indirect interaction between FAK and integrin cytoplasmic tails may also be mediated via talin or paxillin (12Chen H.C. Appeddu P.A. Parsons J.T. Hildebrand J.D. Schaller M.D. Guan J.L. J.

Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 793-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (1003) Google Scholar, 14Chan P.Y. Kanner S.B. Whitney G. Aruffo A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20567-20574Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have demonstrated that a membrane-translocated form of FAK (following fusion to an inert transmembrane anchor) results in an adhesion-independent, constitutive phosphorylation of the molecule. This phosphorylated state of FAK depends on its association with Src and is accompanied by constitutive association with several signaling molecules including Cas and Grb2 (11Frisch S.M. Vuori K. Ruoslahti E. Chan-Hui P.Y. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 793-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (1003) Google Scholar, 14Chan P.Y. Kanner S.B. Whitney G. Aruffo A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20567-20574Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Integrin/FAK association may be essential for adhesion-mediated signaling, which can protect cells against apoptosis (11Frisch S.M. Vuori K. Ruoslahti E. Chan-Hui P.Y. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 793-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (1003) Google Scholar). However, adhesion-mediated signaling responses are transient, pointing to the activity of negative regulatory mechanisms (15Howe A.K. Aplin A.E. Juliano R.L. Curr. Opin.

For example, the adhesion-induced ERK1/2 response is rapid, reaching a peak by 15 min, followed by a swift decay (15Howe A.K. Aplin A.E. Juliano R.L. Curr. Opin.

Matsumoto K. Aota S. Parsons R. Yamada K.M. Science. 1998; 280: 1614-1617Crossref PubMed Scopus (1082) Google Scholar). In the present study, we examined whether membrane association of FAK affects its interaction with focal adhesions and whether such interaction is regulated by the phosphorylation state of FAK. We found that constitutively activated FAK, induced by membrane translocation, is excluded from focal adhesions of murine 3T3 and primary embryonic fibroblasts, as well as primary human fibroblasts. The exclusion of hyper-phosphorylated FAK from focal adhesions was prevented by mutating to arginine the Lys-454 residue (in the ATP-binding site, making this a kinase-crippled mutation after a Lys-to-Arg point mutation), Tyr-397 (the Src family kinase docking site), or Tyr-925 (the C-terminal Grb2 docking site). All of these residues are known to contribute to the FAK/Src family kinase signaling complex. Moreover, induction of hyper-phosphorylation by pervanadate resulted in a similar reduction of FAK at focal adhesions without affecting vinculin localization. We found that the localization of a wild-type FAK transmembrane chimera to focal adhesions improved when Src or a combination of Src, Yes, and Fyn were absent. We suggest that the hyper-phosphorylation of juxtamembrane FAK inhibits its localization to focal adhesions. Furthermore, this hyper-phosphorylation and subsequent interference with FAK localization and function is regulated by Src family kinases. This study demonstrates a novel regulatory mode of FAK subcellular localization controlled by specific tyrosine phosphorylation. Construction of Chimeric Receptors—Chimeric transmembrane receptors were constructed using standard methods (21Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1989Google Scholar). The sequences of all constructs were confirmed by nucleotide sequencing, and protein expression from the constructs described in this study was confirmed following transfection by both immunofluorescence staining and Western immunoblotting. The general approach to generate a chimera with each type of cytoplasmic domain was to insert partial or full-length cDNA molecules into HindIII-XhoI or HindIII-XbaI restriction sites of the plasmid vector pCMV/IL-2R (22LaFlamme S.E. Akiyama S.K. Yamada K.M. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 437-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). This vector is driven by the CMV promoter, and it expresses the extracellular and transmembrane domains of the non-signaling α subunit of the interleukin-2 receptor (IL-2R) as a fusion protein with any molecule of interest as the cytoplasmic domain, as illustrated in Fig. 1A. Mouse FAK cDNA clone (pT7-7-FAK) was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Full-length mouse FAK cDNA was inserted into pCMV/IL-2R as follows. A PCR product encoding the first 500 bp of FAK cDNA was generated using pT7-7-FAK as template with a primer containing a HindIII site followed by 15 nucleotides encoding the first 5 amino acids of FAK (GenBank™ MUSFAK, residue 110): 5′-GGCTAGAAGCTTATGGCAGCTGCTTAT-3′, and the antisense primer 5′-GGTGCTTCTAGAGGTCTACTTGATCAGC-3′ corresponding to nucleotides 586–602 followed by an XbaI site. The PCR product was ligated into CMV/IL-2R using its HindIII and XbaI sites. An AccI-XbaI fragment was then removed from the ligation product and replaced by an AccI-XbaI fragment from pT7-7-FAK, creating a full-length IL-2R/FAK chimera that included the FAK 3′ non-translated region. The FAK454R mutant was generated by converting codon 454 encoding lysine to an arginine residue, and FAK397F and FAK925F were obtained by replacing the tyrosine residue corresponding to amino acid position 397 or 925 with a phenylalanine residue, using PCR-directed mutagenesis. Mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. IL-2R/FRNK chimera was kindly provided by T. Takino (CDBRB, NIDCR, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda). Cells and Transfections—Human foreskin fibroblasts were kindly provided by Susan S. Yamada (NIDCR, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda). NIH 3T3 cells were kindly provided by J. Silvio Gutkind (NIDCR, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda). pp60c-Src null cells (src–/–), derived from mice homozygous for a disruption of the Src gene, as well as wild-type mouse embryo fibroblasts (wt), were kindly provided by P. Schwartzberg and H. Varmus (NHGRI, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda). Fibroblasts homozygous for disruption of the Src, Fyn, and Yes genes were generously provided by P. Soriano (Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center, Seattle). All cell lines were maintained in culture in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, glutamine, penicillin, streptomycin (Biological Industries, Beit Ha'emek, Israel), and 1 mm sodium pyruvate (Sigma). Electroporation of these cells with 30 μg of DNA for each chimeric IL-2R/cytoplasmic protein construct was performed as described previously at 170 V and 960 microfarads with a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser but without any thymidine block (22LaFlamme S.E. Akiyama S.K. Yamada K.M. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 437-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Some transfections were performed using LipofectAMINE Plus (Invitrogen) utilizing standard protocols. Treatment of cells with vanadate was performed using activation to pervanadate as described (23Huyer G. Liu S. Kelly J. Moffat J. Payette P. Kennedy B. Tsaprailis G. Gresser M.J. Ramachandran C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 843-851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar). Briefly, vanadate was activated to pervanadate with hydrogen peroxide, and excess hydrogen peroxide was removed with catalase as described (23Huyer G. Liu S. Kelly J. Moffat J. Payette P. Kennedy B. Tsaprailis G. Gresser M.J. Ramachandran C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 843-851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar). The solution was added to regular culture medium at a final concentration of 0.1 mm pervanadate, and cells were fixed for immunofluorescence after incubation for 5–120 min. Controls were untreated or treated with an equal quantity of control hydrogen peroxide/catalase solution. Immunological Reagents—Mouse monoclonal antibodies 7G7/B6 against the human IL-2 receptor α subunit (Tac antigen) and anti-phosphotyrosine 4G10 were from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). FITC-conjugated rat anti-human IL-2 receptor antibody MCA350F was purchased from Serotec (Raleigh, NC). Mouse anti-human vinculin monoclonal antibody was kindly provided by V. Koteliansky (Biogen, Boston). Mouse monoclonal antibody against FAK was purchased from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—Murine 3T3 cells were transfected with the indicated plasmids, and 48 h later the cells were rinsed with PBS containing 1 mm sodium orthovanadate and lysed with RIPA buffer (1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate). Protein extracts were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Indirect Immunofluorescence—Transfected cells were stained by indirect immunofluorescence as described previously (24Volberg T. Romer L. Zamir E. Geiger B. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2279-2289Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde in PBS for 20 min and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min. The cells were then incubated with the indicated first (45 min) and second (45 min) antibodies in PBS. Anti-FAK, anti-vinculin or anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies were used at 10 μg/ml followed by staining with secondary Alexa- or Cy3-conjugated goat anti-mouse antiserum diluted 1:200. In some experiments, FITC-conjugated rat anti-human IL-2 receptor antibody was utilized at a 1:50 dilution. Digital Fluorescence Image Analysis of Subcellular Distribution— The system used for quantitative fluorescence microscopy and image analysis is described in detail elsewhere (25Zamir E. Katz B.-Z. Aota S.-I. Yamada K.M. Geiger B. Kam Z. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1655-1669Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the specimens were examined with a DeltaVision digital microscope system (Applied Precision). Images of focal adhesions were segmented by the Water algorithm following high pass filtration (subtracting from each pixel the average over 4 × 4 μm area around the particle). The parameters in Water were adjusted to the typical dimensions of focal adhesions and were kept constant for all the analyses. To analyze the relationships between fluorescent probes (IL-2R or phosphotyrosine), focal adhesions were segmented separately, and fluorescence intensities were measured for each probe in the segmented focal adhesions. Ratio images were calculated and presented in a spectral, log scale, color look-up table that ranged from blue for low label ratios (≤0.1) to red for high label ratios (≥10). To utilize this 2 order-of-magnitude range optimally, and to compensate for the differences in photon yields of different fluorescent labels, all the ratios were normalized linearly by a constant that shifted their average toward a ratio value of 1. In order to compare fluorescence intensity visually, spectrum scale presentations of filtered fluorescence data were presented using a blue-to-red linear spectrum scale. Expression and Tyrosine Phosphorylation of Transmembrane FAK Chimeras—It has been established that FAK can be activated by membrane translocation to mimic its proximity to the plasma membrane in focal adhesions (11Frisch S.M. Vuori K. Ruoslahti E. Chan-Hui P.Y. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 793-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (1003) Google Scholar, 14Chan P.Y. Kanner S.B. Whitney G. Aruffo A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20567-20574Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In order to examine whether the phosphorylation of specific tyrosine residues can regulate the subcellular localization of highly phosphorylated FAK, we generated a membrane-targeted form of FAK by fusing it to the non-signaling α subunit of the IL-2R as an inert transmembrane anchor (Fig. 1A). The IL-2R tac antigen (α subunit) was utilized to follow the specific location of the transfected FAK molecules in cells. In addition, we constructed several FAK transmembrane chimeras mutated at residues previously shown to be involved in functions of the wild-type molecule (Fig. 1A). First, we examined the levels of FAK tyrosine phosphorylation following expression of the chimeras in murine 3T3 cells. Previous studies indicated that membrane translocation was sufficient to induce FAK tyrosine phosphorylation even when the cells were maintained in suspension (11Frisch S.M. Vuori K. Ruoslahti E. Chan-Hui P.Y. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 793-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (1003) Google Scholar, 14Chan P.Y. Kanner S.B. Whitney G. Aruffo A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20567-20574Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In agreement with these studies, we found that membrane-translocated FAK becomes hyper-phosphorylated (Fig. 1B). As reported previously, mutations of residues K454R (kinase-mutated) and Y397F (inactive Src family SH2 docking site) significantly reduced FAK hyper-phosphorylation (Fig. 1B) (11Frisch S.M. Vuori K. Ruoslahti E. Chan-Hui P.Y. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 793-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (1003) Google Scholar, 14Chan P.Y. Kanner S.B. Whitney G. Aruffo A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20567-20574Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mutating residue Tyr-925 had no apparent effect on the overall level of FAK phosphorylation (Fig. 1B). In concurrence with previous studies, we observed trans-phosphorylation of endogenous cytoplasmic FAK in cells expressing highly phosphorylated wild type FAK or Y925F chimeras (Fig. 1B) (14Chan P.Y. Kanner S.B. Whitney G. Aruffo A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20567-20574Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Subcellular Localization of Hyper-phosphorylated FAK and Its Mutants—Our previous studies indicated that transmembrane chimeras containing β integrin tails or cytoskeletal molecules (e.g. vinculin) as their cytoplasmic fusions can localize to focal adhesions, in a similar manner to their wild-type counterparts (Fig. 2) (22LaFlamme S.E. Akiyama S.K. Yamada K.M. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 437-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). We tested whether the FAK C-terminal segment designated the focal adhesion targeting (FAT) region is indeed functional when located close to the plane of the membrane. Therefore, we fused the FAK C terminus corresponding to the FRNK region to IL-2R (Fig. 1A). When expressed in human foreskin fibroblasts, this IL-2R/FRNK chimera localized to focal adhesions (not shown). However, as shown in Figs. 2 and 3, IL-2R/FAK that contains the full-length FAK molecule did not localize to focal adhesions of primary human fibroblasts. Lack of IL-2R/FAK localization was also observed in murine 3T3 cells and primary murine fibroblasts (not shown). In a similar manner, the IL-2R molecule without any cytoplasmic tail that served as a negative control was diffusely distributed on the cell membrane in agreement with previous studies (Fig. 2) (22LaFlamme S.E. Akiyama S.K. Yamada K.M. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 437-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). The inability of the FAK chimera to localize was not due to destruction of cell-matrix adhesion sites, as confirmed by double-labeling the transfected cells with anti-vinculin antibody, demonstrating that focal adhesions persist in the transfected cells (Fig. 3). The lack of hyper-phosphorylated FAK localization has been reported previously and may depend on the cell type being examined (11Frisch S.M. Vuori K. Ruoslahti E. Chan-Hui P.Y. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 793-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (1003) Google Scholar). One possibility was that FAK turnover within focal adhesions might decrease, thereby reducing the rate of incorporation of the chimeric form into already-established focal adhesions. To test this hypothesis, the transfected cells were detached and replated on fibronectin-coated coverslips. After 10, 30, 60, and 120 min, the cells were fixed, permeabilized, and double-stained for the IL-2R portion of the chimera and for vinculin. These double-localization analyses demonstrated that even though focal adhesions were formed in the transfected cells (as confirmed by vinculin staining), the chimera was not incorporated into these structures (not shown). This analysis indicates that the IL-2R/FAK chimera is specifically excluded from focal adhesions. To test whether the localization of endogenous FAK is also sensitive to its tyrosine phosphorylation state, cells were treated with pervanadate for 5, 15, 30, 60, or 120 min; they were then fixed, permeabilized, and double-stained with anti-Tyr-397-phosphorylated FAK and anti-FAK or with anti-Tyr-397-phosphorylated FAK and anti-vinculin. At the earliest time point examined (5 min), a substantial increase in diffusely localized Tyr-397-phosphorylated FAK was observed concomitant with a loss of hyper-phosphorylated FAK from focal adhesions that became striking by 15–30 min (Fig. 4). Because phospho-FAK remaining in focal adhesions might theoretically have been masked by the large increases in general cytoplasmic phospho-FAK staining, we also compared the localization of total FAK protein after pervanadate treatment. Total FAK localized to focal adhesions was also substantially reduced, whereas double-staining with anti-vinculin confirmed that the focal adhesions remained intact (Fig. 4). These analyses of endogenous FAK confirm that the amount of FAK in focal adhesions is reduced upon its hyper-phosphorylation. In order to examine the regulation of FAK localization to focal adhesions by specific tyrosine phosphorylation, we transfected human foreskin fibroblasts with IL-2R chimeras containing FAK mutated at the K454R residue (a kinase active-site mutation), Y397F (the Src family kinase docking site), or Y925F (the Grb2 docking site). As shown in Figs. 2 and 3, the IL-2R/FAK Y397F, K454R, and Y925F mutant chimeras localized properly to focal adhesions of these cells. Identical focal adhesion localization patterns were detected with the FAK-mutated chimeras in murine 3T3 fibroblasts and murine embryonic fibroblasts (not shown). Regulation of FAK Localization to Focal Adhesions by Src Family Kinases—Src family kinases are important for generating adhesion-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK (5Schlaepfer D.D. Hanks S.K. Hunter T. van der Geer P. Nature. 1994; 372: 786-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (1448) Google Scholar, 7Schlaepfer D.D. Hauck C.R. Sieg D.J. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1999; 71: 435-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (1036) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that the presence of Src family kinases may be necessary for regulating FAK association with focal adhesions. Therefore, we transfected the wild-type IL-2R/FAK chimera into primary embryonic murine fibroblasts, which served as the control for null fibroblasts. As demonstrated for primary human fibroblasts and murine 3T3 cells, the chimera did not localize to the focal adhesions of these cells (not shown). However, when transfected into Src-deficient fibroblasts (Src –/–) the wild type IL-2R/FAK chimera localized to focal adhesions in ∼100% of the transfected cells (not shown). Since Src family kinases Fyn and Yes may also bind to and phosphorylate FAK, we transfected the wild type IL-2R/FAK chimera into fibroblasts obtained from triple Src family null embryos (SYF –/–), and we examined its subcellular localization. In this experiment, the wild-type IL-2R/FAK chimera (as well as FAK mutants chimeras) localized effectively to focal adhesions of ∼89% of the transfected cells (Fig. 5). FAK mutant chimeras (e.g. FAK K454R) also demonstrated similar localization to focal adhesions of SYF –/– cells (Fig. 5). Appropriate adhesion-mediated signaling responses require tight regulatory mechanisms. Indeed, signaling responses mediated by focal adhesion kinase have been shown to be activated by protein tyrosine kinases (e.g. Src family kinases) or down-regulated by specific phosphatases (e.g. Shp-2 and PTEN) (5Schlaepfer D.D. Hanks S.K. Hunter T. van der Geer P. Nature. 1994; 372: 786-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (1448) Google Scholar, 7Schlaepfer D.D. Hauck C.R. Sieg D.J. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1999; 71: 435-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (1036) Google Scholar, 18Miao H. Burnett E. Kinch M. Simon E. Wang B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 62-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar, 19Davidson D. Veillette A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3414-3426Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 20Tamura M. Gu J. Matsumoto K. Aota S. Parsons R. Yamada K.M. Science. 1998; 280: 1614-1617Crossref PubMed Scopus (1082) Google Scholar). However, adhesion-mediated signaling may be mediated by a variety of molecularly and structurally distinct cell-matrix adhesion sites that include focal adhesions, fibrillar adhesions, three-dimensional matrix adhesions, and podosomes (4Zamir E. Geiger B. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3583-3590Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Geiger B. Bershadsky A. Pankov R. Yamada K.M. Nat. Rev. Mol.

In fact, cell-matrix adhesion sites not only mediate physical association of cells with the extracellular matrix but may also function as specialized sites that initiate and regulate signaling responses (30Almeida E.A. Ilic D. Han Q. Hauck C.R. Jin F. Kawakatsu H. Schlaepfer D.D. Damsky C.H. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 741-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar, 31Calderwood D.A. Shattil S.J. Ginsberg M.H. J.

Sci. 1998; 857: 119-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Although focal adhesion targeting regions have been identified in several cytoskeletal and signaling molecules, including FAK, the regulation of these regions still remains to a large extent unclear. One interesting exception is vinculin. It was shown that vinculin/talin and vinculin/actin associations are regulated by the intramolecular interactions of the vinculin N-terminal head domain with its C-terminal tail (33Johnson R.P. Craig S.W. Nature. 1995; 373: 261-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 34Johnson R.P. Craig S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 95-105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate may govern the vinculin head/tail association, thereby controlling its molecular associations within focal adhesions (33Johnson R.P. Craig S.W. Nature. 1995; 373: 261-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 34Johnson R.P. Craig S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 95-105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Mutations in the proline-rich region of vinculin, which links the head and neck domains, may affect the localization of the molecule (35Craig S.W. Johnson R.P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 74-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). In the present study, we evaluated for the first time the regulation of focal adhesion targeting of FAK by specific tyrosine phosphorylation. We also tested the contribution of Src family kinases to the regulation of FAK targeting to focal adhesions. Following association with the phosphorylated FAK Tyr-397 residue, Src family kinases phosphorylate additional tyrosine residues on FAK (5Schlaepfer D.D. Hanks S.K. Hunter T. van der Geer P. Nature. 1994; 372: 786-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (1448) Google Scholar). Tyr-925 is one of several tyrosine residues reported to be phosphorylated by Src family kinases, generating a docking site for the adaptor protein Grb2 and a signaling complex, resulting in activation of the ERK1/2 response (5Schlaepfer D.D. Hanks S.K. Hunter T. van der Geer P. Nature. 1994; 372: 786-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (1448) Google Scholar). It is interesting to note that Tyr-925 resides within the region defined as the FAT sequence of FAK (Fig. 1) (36Shen Y. Schaller M.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 2507-2518Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Recent studies have indicated that in some cell types, FAK molecules that reside close to the plasma membrane are phosphorylated at residue Tyr-397. These molecules, however, are predominantly diffusely distributed, and only a minor fraction is localized in specific domains (37Ilic D. Genbacev O. Jin F. Caceres E. Almeida E.A. Bellingard-Dubouchaud V. Schaefer E.M. Damsky C.H. Fisher S.J. Am. J. Pathol. 2001; 159: 93-108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In contrast, the predominant in vivo state of residue Tyr-925 is apparently unphosphorylated (26Nakamura K. Yano H. Schaefer E. Sabe H. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2626-2635Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Although focal adhesions of cells in vitro contain high levels of tyrosine-phosphorylated molecules, non-phosphorylated or partially phosphorylated FAK molecules appear to be the predominant form of this molecule associated with matrix adhesions in vivo (29Cukierman E. Pankov R. Stevens D.R. Yamada K.M. Science. 2001; 294: 1708-1712Crossref PubMed Scopus (2464) Google Scholar). Tyr-397-phosphorylated FAK does not localize to “three-dimensional matrix adhesions” in fibroblasts attaching to three-dimensional matrices in vitro, although it can be found in small focal complexes. Similarly, α5 integrin co-localizes with FAK in mouse embryonic tissue sections but not with Tyr-397-phosphorylated FAK (29Cukierman E. Pankov R. Stevens D.R. Yamada K.M. Science. 2001; 294: 1708-1712Crossref PubMed Scopus (2464) Google Scholar). We speculate that hyper-phosphorylated FAK is excluded from focal adhesions for a variety of reasons. Phosphorylation that includes Tyr-925 may generate a constitutive association with Grb2, as shown in previous studies (11Frisch S.M. Vuori K. Ruoslahti E. Chan-Hui P.Y. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 793-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (1003) Google Scholar). The constitutive signaling complex might sterically block the focal adhesion targeting site, thereby inhibiting the association of activated FAK with focal adhesions (Fig. 6). Alternatively, the phosphorylation per se could have an inhibitory effect. The fact that the highly phosphorylated IL-2R/FAK Y925F mutant does localize to focal adhesions indicates that inhibition of FAK incorporation into focal adhesions does not stem merely from total tyrosine phosphorylation of the molecule but from the phosphorylation of specific residue(s). As depicted in Fig. 1A, Tyr-925 resides within the FAT segment of FAK. Therefore, the specific tyrosine phosphorylation of the Tyr-925 residue may be important for the regulation of FAK localization to focal adhesions. An additional mechanism that may explain the failure of highly phosphorylated FAK to localize to focal adhesions requires a higher affinity association of hyper-phosphorylated FAK with other molecular complexes, the FAK “scaffold.” These complexes may be tied up elsewhere within the cytoplasm, and the off-rates of these interactions significantly altered such that availability of FAK for standard focal adhesion targeting (e.g. via paxillin and talin) is decreased. Alternatively, the constitutively hyper-phosphorylated FAK may have more restricted mobility in the plane of the membrane due to interactions (directly or indirectly via phosphatidylinositol phosphate) with membrane lipoproteins. The common denominator of these putative mechanisms is the basic principle that tyrosine residues on FAK may function as molecular binary switches (“transistors”), cycling between states of reactivity according to their phosphorylation level. Tyr-397 is trans-phosphorylated by nearby FAK molecules and thus is regulated by the local density of the molecules localized at the plasma membrane (Fig. 6). Phosphorylation at this site determines whether FAK will bind Src family kinases and possibly other molecules, e.g. phospholipase Cγ (28Zhang X. Chattopadhyay A. Ji Q.S. Owen J.D. Ruest P.J. Carpenter G. Hanks S.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9021-9026Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Src family kinases expand the biochemical signal to additional tyrosine residues, including Tyr-925 (Fig. 6). Phosphorylation of Tyr-925 may require its molecular association with an Src family kinase domain. Such association may be transient, but at high molecular density of FAK and Src family molecules close to the inner plasma membrane plane it may become more continuous. This specific state is achieved by use of the chimeric FAK, which may represent the early stages of cell adhesion, where FAK is recruited to the plasma membrane via direct and/or indirect interactions with integrin tails. A previous study (11Frisch S.M. Vuori K. Ruoslahti E. Chan-Hui P.Y. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 793-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (1003) Google Scholar) indicated that anti-apoptotic signals, mediated by cell adhesion, may be inhibited by peptides that inhibit direct interactions between FAK and integrin tails. This inhibition was effective only during the early stages of cell adhesion (11Frisch S.M. Vuori K. Ruoslahti E. Chan-Hui P.Y. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 793-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (1003) Google Scholar). Therefore, several tyrosine residues of FAK may have a dual function as follows: 1) regulation of biochemical signaling responses, by directly controlling FAK enzymatic activity and its associations with signaling molecules; and 2) regulation of FAK localization by modulation of intermolecular and/or intramolecular interactions. This concept may apply to other molecules as well. The two regulatory modes may be linked to an integrated mode combining the subcellular localization of active signaling complexes. In the case of FAK, hyper-phosphorylated molecules on specific tyrosine residues may be selectively excluded from cell-matrix adhesion sites."

Results of earlier work led us to propose a model for JIP1-JNK complex regulation that predicts that under basal conditions, JIP1 maintains DLK in a monomeric, unphosphorylated, and catalytically inactive state. Upon appropriate module stimulation, JNK-JIP1 binding affinity increases and DLK-JIP1 affinity decreases. Dissociation of DLK from JIP1 results in subsequent DLK oligomerization, autophosphorylation, and ultimately module activation. Our previous published results suggested the hypothesis that recruitment of JNK to JIP1 and phosphorylation of JIP1 by JNK is prerequisite for activation of the JNK module (Nihalani, D., Meyer, D., Pajni, S., and Holzman, L. B. (2001) EMBO J. 20, 3447–3458). The present study corroborated this hypothesis by demonstrating that JNK binding to JIP1 is necessary for stimulus-induced dissociation of DLK from JIP1, for DLK oligomerization, and for JNK activation. After mapping JNK-dependent JIP1 phosphorylation sites and testing their functional significance, it was observed that phosphorylation by JNK of JIP1 on Thr-103 and not other phosphorylated JIP1 residues is necessary for the regulation of DLK association with JIP1, DLK activation, and subsequent module activation. A refined model of JIP1-JNK module regulation is presented in which JNK phosphorylation of JIP1 is necessary prior to module activation.

Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) 1The abbreviations used are: MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; HA, hemagglutinin; GST, glutathione S-transferase; JIP, JNK interacting protein; DLK, dual leucine zipper kinase; MKK7, mitogen activated-protein kinase kinase 7. link a variety of extracellular signals to a diverse range of cellular responses such as proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. Three groups of mammalian MAPKs and the upstream kinases and stimuli that activate them have been studied most extensively. These include the p42/p44MAPK (extracellular signal-regulated kinases, ERK1 and -2), that are generally activated by mitogens and differentiation-inducing stimuli, the stress-activated protein kinases (p46/p54SAPK or JNK1, 2, or 3 and their splice isoforms) and the p38mapk (1Charest D.L.

The stress-activated protein kinases have also been termed JNK protein kinases because they were identified as the principal c-Jun N-terminal kinases. The JNK family kinases are activated by cell stress-inducing stimuli such as heat shock, UV irradiation, hyperosmolarity, and ischemia/reperfusion injury, and by activation of specific cell surface receptors (7Ip Y.T.

Studies performed in cell culture systems and investigation of genetic mutants in a number of model organisms has begun to establish a variety of distinct physiological roles for individual stress-activated protein kinases and their associated pathways. Indeed, distinct JNK family kinases have been implicated in multiple specific biological processes that include but are not limited to embryonic morphogenesis, regulation of the apoptotic response to cellular injury, regulation of thymocyte development and activation, and regulation of proliferation (10Chen Y.R.

Experiments in yeast have provided evidence that MAP kinase pathways are assembled from a unique combination of protein kinases into distinct protein complexes or modules (18Herskowitz I.

Importantly, assembly of MAPK modules appears to allow segregation of MAPK signaling components into units that are responsive to independent stimuli, that obtain appropriate subcellular targeting, that are insulated from similar modules, and that can regulate functionally distinct substrates (26Cheng J.

Identification of the JIP family of JNK scaffolding proteins first established that mammalian cells organize JNK pathways into modules in a fashion similar to yeast (29Yasuda J. Whitmarsh A.J. Cavanagh J. Sharma M. Davis R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7245-7254Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). Three JIP family genes and several splice isoforms have been identified (30Davis R.J. Cell. 2000; 103: 239-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3666) Google Scholar, 31Kelkar N.

Sci. 1998; 23: 481-485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). JIP proteins can form homo- and hetero-oligomers and are phosphoproteins. Whereas JIP3 is structurally distant from JIP1 and JIP2, each has been demonstrated to associate directly with a mixed lineage kinase, with MKK7 and with JNK (29Yasuda J. Whitmarsh A.J. Cavanagh J. Sharma M. Davis R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7245-7254Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar, 31Kelkar N. Gupta S. Dickens M. Davis R.J. Mol. Cell.

Science. 1998; 281: 1671-1674Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that JIP proteins facilitate mixed lineage kinase-dependent signal transduction to JNK possibly by aggregating the three components of a JNK module (30Davis R.J. Cell. 2000; 103: 239-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3666) Google Scholar). Although a considerable amount of work has been done to establish the role of JIP1 in regulating JNK signaling, less is known about the mechanisms that govern this regulation. We previously demonstrated that JNK kinase module components DLK and JNK interact with JIP1 in a dynamic manner to regulate the activation of the associated mixed lineage kinase and ultimately JNK module activity (34Nihalani D. Meyer D. Pajni S. Holzman L.B. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3447-3458Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The results of that study suggested a model in which JIP1 maintains DLK in a monomeric, unphosphorylated, and catalytically inactive state. Stimuli resulting in recruitment of JNK to JIP1 also result in release of DLK from JIP1, DLK dimerization, autophosphorylation, and activation, and ultimately induction of JNK catalytic activity. Our previous results implied but did not prove that recruitment of JNK to JIP1 is prerequisite to activating of upstream kinases that are components of a pre-assembled inactive JIP1 complex. In the present study we have investigated the significance of JNK recruitment to JIP1 and have investigated the mechanism by which JNK recruitment regulates module activation. The data presented corroborates our previous observations using endogenous proteins, demonstrates that JNK binding to JIP1 is necessary for module activation, and shows that activation of JIP1-JNK module dynamics requires phosphorylation of JIP1 on Thr-103 by JNK. A refined model of JNK module regulation is proposed. Reagents—Polyclonal antibodies to the C-terminal 223 amino acids of DLK was described previously (35Mata M. Merritt S.E. Fan G. Yu G.G.

Mammalian expression constructs encoding various JIP1 mutants were prepared by standard PCR cloning techniques using Myc-JIP1 plasmid as a template. Restriction digestion and DNA sequencing were used to validate all constructs. Cell Culture—Transient transfections in mammalian cells were carried out in COS7 and HN33 cells. The cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) and 200 units/ml penicillin and streptomycin (Roche Diagnostics). The transfection was performed using FuGENE-6 (Roche Diagnostics) according to the manufacturer's protocols using a total of 2 μg of DNA. Where indicated cells were treated by the addition of indicated concentrations of either okadaic acid or kainic acid 24 h after transfection. In Vivo Orthophosphate Labeling of Cells—COS7 cells were transfected with the indicated constructs. After 24 h, cells were washed three times with phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium then incubated at 37 °C in the same medium for 30 min. The cells were then incubated in phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.5% dialyzed fetal bovine serum and 1 mCi/ml [γ-32P]ATP orthophosphate (Amersham Biosciences) for 4 h at 37 °C. Immunoprecipitations and Immunoblotting—Immunoprecipitations were performed using the indicated antibodies as described previously (38Nihalani D. Merritt S. Holzman L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7273-7279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). JNK Activation Assays—Cells were transfected with plasmid constructs as indicated in the figure legends. Cell lysates were prepared 24 h after transfection using 1 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, and a mixture of protease inhibitors (Roche Diagnostics, catalogue number 1836170). In vitro reconstituted kinase catalytic activity assays (Figs. 4 and 9A) were performed as described previously (38Nihalani D. Merritt S. Holzman L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7273-7279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Briefly, the immunoprecipitated complexes from the lysates were incubated at 30 °C for 10 min in 50 μl of kinase buffer (25 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 10% glycerol, 100 mm NaCl, 20 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm sodium vanadate, and a mixture of protease inhibitors) containing 25 μm ATP, 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol), and the indicated quantities of GST-JNK or GST-MKK7. The reactions were terminated by the addition of sample buffer, boiled, resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and autoradiographed. Expression of DLK or JIP1 constructs in each sample was assessed by immunoblotting.Fig. 9Phosphorylation of JIP1 by JNK on Thr-103 is necessary for JNK activation. A, COS7 cells were co-transfected with the indicated plasmids. JIP1 was immunoprecipitated from the cell lysates using anti-FLAG antibody. Immune complexes were combined in vitro with recombinant GST-MKK7, GST-JNK, and GST-c-Jun in a kinase buffer containing [γ-32P]ATP and incubated at 30 °C for 15 min. Immune complexes were separated on SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and autoradiographed. Immunoblots from corresponding cell lysates were used to evaluate the relative expression of DLK and JIP1 in each reaction. Similar results were obtained in three independent experiments. B, JIP1 mutants bind JNK with similar affinities. COS7 cells were co-transfected with the indicated plasmids.

Cell lysates from the corresponding experiments were also analyzed for the equivalent expression of JIP1 and JNK.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Phosphopeptide Mapping—Two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping was performed as described by Boyle et al. (39Boyle W.J. van der Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1276) Google Scholar). Following an in vitro kinase assay or immunoprecipitation of phosphate-labeled proteins, the substrate was resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and the protein band was identified by autoradiography and excised from the membrane. The nitrocellulose membrane pieces containing the 32P-labeled proteins (wild-type JIP1 and mutant JIP1 proteins) were excised, soaked in 0.5% polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP-360) in 100 mm acetic acid for 30 min at 37 °C, and washed extensively with water and freshly made 0.05 m NH4HCO3. Tryptic digestion was performed by incubating samples with sequencing grade trypsin (20 μg in 200 μl of freshly prepared 50 mm NH4HCO3 overnight at 37 °C). The supernatants were transferred and dried in a Speed-vac and the samples were solubilized in pH 1.9 buffer (containing 2.5% (v/v) formic acid (88%) and 7.8% (v/v) acetic acid). Aliquots (2–5 μl) of each sample (containing 20,000 cpm) were spotted onto 20 × 20-cm thin-layer cellulose plates and separated in the first dimension by electrophoresis for 45 min at 1000 V using buffer containing 2.5% formic acid and 7.8% acetic acid at pH 1.9. After drying, peptides were further separated in the second dimension by ascending chromatography for 8 h using buffer containing 37.5% (v/v) 1-butanol, 25% (v/v) pyridine, and 5% (v/v) acetic acid. The pattern of tryptic phosphopeptides was visualized by exposing the dried cellulose plates to a PhosphorImager plate (Amersham Biosciences model Storm-860). Stimulation-induced Dissociation of Endogenous JIP1 and DLK in Cultured Neurons—Our previous experiments suggested that there exists a regulated dynamic relationship between DLK, JIP1, and JNK (34Nihalani D. Meyer D. Pajni S. Holzman L.B. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3447-3458Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). However, these conclusions were drawn from studies performed by overexpression of module components in COS7 cells. To determine whether a similar relationship between DLK, JIP1, and JNK exists among endogenous module components, the interaction of endogenous DLK and JIP1 and endogenous JNK and JIP1 was studied in HN33 neuronal cell culture. HN33 cells were stimulated with or without okadaic acid and the association of endogenous DLK with JIP1 or JNK with JIP1 was examined in co-immunoprecipitation assays (Fig. 1A). Consistent with our previously published results, treatment of HN33 cells with okadaic acid resulted in recruitment of endogenous JNK to JIP1 and dissociation of endogenous DLK from the JIP1 complex (34Nihalani D. Meyer D. Pajni S. Holzman L.B. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3447-3458Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Because JIP1 was expressed at difficult to detect levels within HN33 cells, similar additional experiments were repeated by transfecting these cells with plasmid encoding JIP1 (Fig. 1, B and C). Treatment of neuronal cells in culture with either okadaic acid or kainic acid results in JNK activation and induction of an apoptotic response that might be in part mediated by mixed lineage kinases (8Savinainen A. Garcia P.E. Dorow D. Marshall J. Liu F.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11382-11386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 40Barancik M. Htun P. Schaper W. J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol. 1999; 34: 182-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 41Harris C. Maroney A.C. Johnson E.M. J. Neurochem. 2002; 83: 992-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In a manner similar to that observed when HN33 cells were treated with okadaic acid, kainic acid induced the dissociation of endogenous DLK from JIP1 within 30 min of treatment (Fig. 1B). Moreover, kainic acid treatment of HN33 cells also resulted in JNK recruitment to JIP1 and increased JIP1 phosphorylation (Fig. 1C). These results provide initial evidence that endogenous DLK, JIP1, and JNK interact in a dynamic fashion and that this process is associated with JIP1 phosphorylation. JNK Binding to JIP1 Is Necessary for DLK Dissociation from JIP1 and Its Dimerization in the Presence of Okadaic Acid— Our previous published results suggested the hypothesis that recruitment of JNK to JIP1 is necessary for the activation of the JIP1-dependent JNK module (34Nihalani D. Meyer D. Pajni S. Holzman L.B. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3447-3458Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). To test this hypothesis, a JIP1 mutant was prepared that does not associate with JNK. Whitmarsh et al. (33Whitmarsh A.J. Cavanagh J. Tournier C. Yasuda J. Davis R.J. Science. 1998; 281: 1671-1674Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar) showed that the JIP1 JNK binding domain localized between residues 127 and 282. Kelkar et al. (31Kelkar N. Gupta S. Dickens M. Davis R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1030-1043Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar) mapped specific residues in JIP3 necessary for the interaction of JIP3 with JNK. Sequence comparison revealed that these residues were highly conserved within the JNK binding domain among all JIP isoforms (31Kelkar N. Gupta S. Dickens M. Davis R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1030-1043Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Therefore, mutations were introduced in JIP1 at residues 160 (arginine to glycine) and 161 (proline to glycine). As shown if Fig. 2, when co-expressed with FLAG-JNK, JNK did not co-immunoprecipitate with this JIP1(R60G/P161G) mutant. Using this mutant, we tested whether preventing recruitment of JNK to JIP1 inhibited dissociation of DLK from JIP1 as predicted by our model. FLAG-DLK was co-expressed with either JIP1 or JIP1(R160G/P161G). Cells were treated with okadaic acid or control buffer for 3 h. JIP1 or its mutant was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates using JIP1-specific antibodies and immunoprecipitated complexes were analyzed for the presence of DLK (Fig. 3A). As shown in Fig. 3A, both wild type JIP1 and JIP1(R160G/P161G) bound DLK under control conditions. As reported previously, okadaic acid treatment resulted in dissociation of DLK from JIP1. However, under the same conditions, DLK did not dissociate from JIP1(R160G/P161G). Treatment of cells with okadaic acid also results in DLK oligomerization in the presence of JIP1 (34Nihalani D. Meyer D. Pajni S. Holzman L.B. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3447-3458Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Because DLK dissociation from JIP1 is thought to precede DLK oligomerization (34Nihalani D. Meyer D. Pajni S. Holzman L.B. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3447-3458Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), it was anticipated that preventing JNK binding to JIP1 after treatment with okadaic acid would also inhibit DLK oligomerization. To test this hypothesis, FLAG-DLK and HA-DLK were co-expressed with either JIP1 or JIP1(R160G/P161G) in COS7 cells (Fig. 3B). Cells were treated with okadaic acid or control buffer for 3 h. FLAG-DLK was immunoprecipitated using anti-FLAG-agarose beads and immune complexes were analyzed for the presence of HA-DLK. As previously observed, JIP1 inhibited DLK oligomerization under basal conditions (Fig. 3B, lane 2) and DLK oligomerization in the presence of JIP1 was promoted upon treatment of cells with okadaic acid (Fig. 3B, lane 3). However, while JIP1(R160G/P161G) prevented DLK oligomerization, okadaic acid failed to promote DLK oligomerization in the presence of this JIP1 mutant. Combined with observations described above, these results provide evidence that JNK binding to JIP1 is necessary for dissociation of DLK from JIP1 and the subsequent oligomerization of DLK. JNK Association with JIP1 Is Necessary for JIP1-dependent JNK Activation—Because DLK oligomerization is required for its activation (34Nihalani D. Meyer D. Pajni S. Holzman L.B. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3447-3458Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) the above results suggested that JNK recruitment to JIP1 should also be necessary for DLK-mediated JNK activation. To test whether JNK binding to JIP1 is necessary for DLK-mediated JNK activation, the module was reconstituted in vitro and assayed for JNK activation as described previously (34Nihalani D. Meyer D. Pajni S. Holzman L.B. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3447-3458Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4). DLK or catalytically inactive DLK(K185A) was co-expressed with JIP1, JIP1(R160G/P161G), or JIP1(S197A/T205A/T284A) in COS7 cells. The various JIP1-DLK complexes were obtained after immunoprecipitation of JIP1(X) from cell lysates using anti-JIP1 antibodies. GST-JNK activation was determined by incubating the immunoprecipitated complexes with a mixture of bacterially expressed and purified recombinant GST-MKK7, GST-JNK, and GST-c-Jun in a kinase buffer containing radiolabeled ATP. In this system, GST-JNK was activated when incubated in the presence of DLK and JIP1. In contrast, GST-JNK was not activated in the absence of DLK or in the presence of catalytically inactive DLK(K185A) and JIP1 (Fig. 4, compare lanes 1 and 2; see also Fig. 9, lanes 1 and 2). GST-JNK was activated in a similar manner when the JIP1(S197A/T205A/T284A)-DLK complex was substituted for wild type JIP1-DLK in the reaction mixture (Fig. 4, lanes 4–6). However, GST-JNK activation was substantially attenuated when JIP1(R160G/P161G) was substituted for wild type JIP1 (Fig. 4, lanes 7–9). In conclusion, these results refine the previously published model and suggest that JNK recruitment to JIP1 is necessary for DLK dissociation, DLK oligomerization, and DLK activation, and ultimately for induction of JNK activity. JIP1 Is Phosphorylated by JNK on Multiple Sites—Because JIP1 phosphorylation was observed to correlate with alterations in the affinity of JIP1 for JNK and DLK (Fig. 1), and because JNK-JIP1 interaction negatively influenced DLK and JIP1 binding affinity, we hypothesized that JIP1 module dynamics are dependent upon JNK-mediated phosphorylation of JIP1. Wild type JIP1 or the JIP1(R160G/P161G) mutant obtained by immunoprecipitation from transfected COS7 cells were combined with preactivated recombinant GST-JNK in a kinase buffer containing radiolabeled ATP. JIP1 phosphorylation required binding of JNK to JIP1 and occurred only in the presence of"
https://openalex.org/W2028817220,"The mammalian Ror family receptor tyrosine kinases, Ror1 and Ror2, play crucial roles in developmental morphogenesis. Although the functions of Ror1 and Ror2 are redundant, Ror2 exhibits more specific functions during development. We show that when expressed in mammalian cells, Ror2, but not Ror1, associates with the melanoma-associated antigen (MAGE) family protein, Dlxin-1, which is known to bind to the homeodomain proteins Msx2 and Dlx5 and regulate their transcriptional functions. This association requires the cytoplasmic C-terminal region of Ror2, containing proline-rich and serine/threonine-rich domains, and the C-terminal necdin homology domain of Dlxin-1. Interestingly, the cytoplasmic C-terminal region of Ror2 is missing in patients with brachydactyly type B. Interestingly, transient expression and immunohistochemical analyses reveal that both Dlxin-1 and Msx2 are co-localized in the nuclei in the absence of Ror2. In the presence of Ror2, Dlxin-1 is co-localized with Ror2 at the membranous compartments and Msx2 is retained in the nuclei. It was also found that the majority of cellular Dlxin-1 is retained in the membrane fractions of wild-type but not Ror2 –/– mouse embryonic fibroblasts. Furthermore, we show that transcriptional activity of Msx2, irrespective of Ror2 kinase activity, is regulated by ectopic expression of Ror2 using a reporter plasmid containing the WIP element. Thus, Ror2 sequesters Dlxin-1 in membranous compartments, thereby affecting the transcriptional function of Msx2.

Because the spatiotemporal expression patterns of Ror1 and Ror2 overlap considerably, and both transcripts are detected in the face, limbs, heart, and lungs during mouse embryogenesis (10Al-Shawi R.

Mech. Dev. 2001; 105: 153-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), it has been assumed that the developmental functions of Ror1 and Ror2 may be at least partially redundant. Previous genetic studies have demonstrated that both mouse Ror2 and Ror1 play important roles in developmental morphogenesis, in particular in skeletal and cardiac development (12DeChiara T.M.

Mice lacking Ror2 exhibit dwarfism, short limbs (with mesomelic dysplasia) and tails, facial abnormalities, ventricular septal defects, and respiratory dysfunction resulting in neonatal lethality (12DeChiara T.M.

Ror1-deficient mice also die soon after birth due to respiratory dysfunction, yet they do not show any apparent skeletal or cardiac phenotypes (13Nomi M. Oishi I. Kani S. Suzuki H. Matsuda T. Yoda A.

Furthermore, Ror1/Ror2 double mutant mice exhibit markedly enhanced skeletal and cardiac abnormalities compared with Ror2 mutant mice, indicating that Ror1 and Ror2 interact genetically and functionally during the development of these organs (13Nomi M. Oishi I. Kani S. Suzuki H. Matsuda T. Yoda A. Kitamura M. Itoh K. Takeuchi S. Takeda K. Akira S. Ikeya M. Takada S. Minami Y. Mol. Cell.

Interestingly, it has recently been reported that mutations within Ror2 are responsible for brachydactyly type B (BDB), a dominant skeletal disorder characterized by hypoplasia/aplasia of distal phalanges (15Oldridge M.

However, little is known about the signaling mechanisms mediated by Ror1 and Ror2. To gain insights into Ror1- and/or Ror2-mediated signaling, yeast two-hybrid screening was employed to identify proteins that interact with Ror1 and/or Ror2, and a cDNA encoding Dlxin-1, a member of the melanoma-associated antigen (MAGE) family (19Imai Y. Shichijo S. Yamada A. Katayama T. Yano H. Itoh K. Gene. 1995; 160: 287-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 20Maruyama K. Usami M. Aizawa T. Yoshikawa K. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Dlxin-1 has been shown to associate with the homeodomain proteins Msx2 and Dlx5 and to regulate the transcriptional function of Dlx5 (22Masuda Y. Sasaki A. Shibuya H. Ueno N. Ikeda K. Watanabe K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5331-5338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The Rat ortholog of Dlxin-1, designated NRAGE or MAGE-D, has also been characterized (23Hennuy B.

NRAGE has been shown to bind to the p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR) and to confer nerve growth factor-dependent apoptosis on developing neuronal cells (24Salehi A.H. Roux P.P. Kubu C.J. Zeindler C. Bhakar A. Tannis L.-L. Verdi J.M. Barker P.A. Neuron. 2000; 27: 279-288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). In addition, it has been reported that NRAGE interacts with an inhibitor of apoptosis protein (IAP) and augments interleukin-3 withdrawal-induced apoptosis of the promyeloid leukemic cell line 32D (25Jordan B.W. Dinev D. LeMellay V. Troppmair J. Götz R. Wixler L. Sendtner M. Ludwig S. Rapp U.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39985-39989Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has recently been shown that NRAGE induces caspase activation and activates a mitochondrial apoptotic cascade through a c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase- and c-Jun-dependent pathway (26Salehi A.H. Xanthoudakis S. Barker P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48043-48050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Here we show that Ror2, but not Ror1, associates with Dlxin-1 when expressed in mammalian cells. The association of Ror2 with Dlxin-1 requires the cytoplasmic C-terminal region of Ror2, which containing proline-rich and serine/threonine-rich domains. This region is deleted in Ror2 from BDB patients, suggesting a possible role of Dlxin-1 in the pathogenesis of BDB. Interestingly, although Dlxin-1 and Msx2 are co-localized in the nuclei in the absence of Ror2, the subcellular distribution of Dlxin-1, but not Msx2, is altered by the presence of Ror2. These data indicate that Dlxin-1 is an important mediator of Ror2 function and that its subcellular distribution is regulated in turn by Ror2. Plasmid Construction—Mouse Ror1 and Ror2 cDNAs were isolated as described previously (7Oishi I. Takeuchi S. Hashimoto R. Nagabukuro A. Ueda T. Liu Z.-J. Hatta T. Akira S. Matsuda Y. Yamamura H. Otani H. Minami Y. Genes Cells. 1999; 4: 41-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). For the construction of bait plasmids, the cDNAs encoding the cytoplasmic domains of Ror1 and Ror2 were each subcloned into pAS2-1. Expression vectors encoding the FLAG- or HA-tagged Ror proteins (pcDNA-Ror1-FLAG, pcDNA-Ror2-FLAG, pcDNA-Ror2-HA) were constructed as follows. The cDNA fragments corresponding to Ror1 and Ror2 were obtained by PCR using a combination of specific primers that create HindIII/NotI sites for Ror1 and EcoRV/XhoI site for Ror2, respectively, at the ends of each cDNA region. Subsequently, these cDNA fragments were ligated into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). To generate pcDNA-Ror2ΔC-FLAG and pcDNA-Ror2ΔC-HA, the C-terminal region of Ror2, i.e. amino acids 788–944 containing the proline-rich (Pro-rich) and serine/threonine-rich (Ser/Thr-rich 2) domains, were deleted. To generate pcDNA-Ror2(Rob)-FLAG, amino acids 502–944, containing the Pro-rich and serine/threonine-rich (Ser/Thr-rich 1, Ser/Thr-rich 2) domains and the major part of the kinase domain, were deleted. The expression vector pcDNA-Ror2DK-FLAG, encoding a kinase-dead mutant of Ror2, was constructed by replacing lysine 507, crucial for ATP binding, with arginine. In some experiments, the expression vectors pEAK12 (Edge BioSystems) encoding Ror2 WT or Ror2 DK were utilized, and essentially identical results were obtained compared with those obtained by utilizing pcDNA expression vectors (data not shown). The expression vectors pcDNA-HA-Dlxin1, pcDNA-HA-Dlxin1ΔN, pcDNA-HA-Dlxin1DlxBD, pcDNA-HA-Dlxin1ΔC, pcDNA-FLAG-Msx2, and pcDNA-HA-Msx2 were constructed as described previously (22Masuda Y. Sasaki A. Shibuya H. Ueno N. Ikeda K. Watanabe K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5331-5338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The pGL2-WIP reporter gene plasmid was constructed as described previously (27Zhang H. Hu G. Wang H. Sciavolino P. Iler N. Shen M.M. Abate-Shen C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2920-2932Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Antibodies, Cells, and Transfection—Mouse monoclonal antibody M2 (Eastman Kodak) recognizes the FLAG peptide sequence (DYKD-DDDK). Mouse monoclonal antibody 12CA5 (Roche Applied Science), rat monoclonal antibody 3F10 (Roche Applied Science), and rabbit polyclonal antibody recognize the peptide sequence (YPYDVPDYA) derived from the human influenza hemagglutinin (HA) protein. Rabbit polyclonal anti-DXN-NHD antibody was used to detect endogenous mouse Dlxin-1 (28Sasaki A. Masuda Y. Iwai K. Ikeda K. Watanabe K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22541-22546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Mouse monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies, PY20 and 4G10, were purchased from Transduction Laboratories and Upstate Biotechnology, respectively. Alexa Fluor 546 (goat anti-mouse IgG, red) and Alexa Fluor 488 (goat anti-rat IgG, green) were purchased from Molecular Probes. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were prepared from E12.5 embryos using a 3T3 protocol (29Todaro G.J. Green H. J. Cell Biol. 1963; 17: 299-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (1984) Google Scholar). MEFs, HEK293, and 293T cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Nissui) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum (FCS). Transient cDNA transfection into cells was performed using the calcium phosphate method (30Minami Y. Nakagawa Y. Kawahara A. Miyazaki T. Sada K. Yamamura H. Taniguchi T. Immunity. 1995; 2: 89-100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), or LipofectAMINE reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Yeast Two-hybrid Screening—Yeast two-hybrid screening was performed following the manufacturer's instructions (Matchmaker, Clontech). Briefly, the bait plasmids, pAS2-1-Ror1DK and pAS2-1-Ror2DK, were constructed by inserting the cDNA fragments encoding the cytoplasmic regions of kinase-dead version of mouse Ror1 and Ror2, respectively, in-frame at the NcoI site of pAS2-1 (Clontech). A yeast strain, Y190, was co-transformed with the bait plasmids pAS2-1-Ror1DK or pAS2-1-Ror2DK along with the mouse embryo (17 days post-coital (d.p.c.)) cDNA library carried in the prey plasmid pGAD10 (Clontech). Approximately 5 × 106 transformants were selected for their ability to grow on SD plates lacking histidine (containing 50 mm 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole). The colonies grown on SD plates were subsequently analyzed for β-galactosidase activity by filter assays, and ∼20 and 30 β-galactosidase-positive clones were obtained when pAS2-1-Ror1DK and pAS2-1-Ror2DK were co-transformed, respectively. Among them, three and six independent clones, respectively, were found to possess the prey plasmids containing the cDNA fragments that encode Dlxin-1 protein, as assessed by sequence analysis with an ABI PRISM 310 Genetic Analyzer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Prey plasmids recovered from positive yeast colonies were re-examined by co-transformation into Y190 with the original bait plasmid followed by a β-galactosidase assay. Preparation of Cell Lysates and Subcellular Fractions—Cells were solubilized with lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.5% (v/v) Non-idet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin), and cell lysates were prepared by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 15 min. Preparation of subcellular fractions from MEFs (wild type and Ror2 –/–) was carried out as described previously (31Minami Y. Stafford F.J. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Yuan L.C. Klausner R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9222-9230Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—Cell lysates were precleared for 1 h at 4 °C with protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). The precleared supernatants were then immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody (M2) conjugated to protein A-Sepharose beads for 2 h at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitates were washed five times with 1 ml of the above described lysis buffer and eluted with Laemmli sample buffer. The immunoprecipitates or whole cell lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane filters (Immobilon, Millipore). The membranes were immunoblotted with the respective antibodies, and bound antibodies were visualized with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies to mouse, rat, or rabbit IgGs using chemiluminescence reagent (Renaissance, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) as described previously (6Oishi I.

Immunofluorescence—Cells grown on coverslips coated by rat-tail collagen were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS for 15min at room temperature and then permeabilized with PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 for 15 min at room temperature. After blocking in PBS with 10% FCS for 30 min, cells were incubated with primary antibodies, anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody (M2, 1:500), and/or anti-HA monoclonal antibody (3F10, 1:200), in PBS, 10% FCS for 30 min at room temperature. Cells were washed twice with PBS and then incubated with secondary antibodies, Alexa Fluor 546 (anti-mouse IgG antibody, 1:500), and/or Alexa Fluor 488 (anti-rat IgG antibody, 1:200) in PBS, 10% FCS at room temperature for 30 min. After two washes in PBS, the cells were mounted with Pristine Mount (Research Genetics) and analyzed with an uplight fluorescence microscope (Zeiss). Reporter Gene Assays—HEK293 cells (1.5 × 105 cells/well) were seeded onto 24-well plates. Cells were transfected with the pGL2-WIP reporter gene plasmid (27Zhang H. Hu G. Wang H. Sciavolino P. Iler N. Shen M.M. Abate-Shen C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2920-2932Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar) along with the respective expression vectors as indicated by using LipofectAMINE reagent (Invitrogen). The total amount of DNA (1.0 μg) was kept constant with empty vector. For normalization of transfection efficiencies, 0.2 μg of Renilla (sea pansy) luciferase expression plasmid (pRL-TK, Promega) was included in transfection experiments. Transfected cells were lysed and subjected to luciferase assays using PicaGene dual sea pansy system (Toyo Ink) following the manufacturer's instructions. The assays were performed in triplicates. In Situ Hybridization—In situ hybridization analyses were performed essentially as described previously (33Yoshikawa Y. Fujimori T. McMahon A.P. Takada S. Dev.

Identification of Dlxin-1 as a Ror2-interacting Protein—To better understand the roles of Ror1 and Ror2 during development, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screening to identify potential cytoplasmic signaling molecule(s) that can associate with the cytoplasmic regions of Ror1 and Ror2. A whole mouse E17 yeast two-hybrid library was screened using the entire mouse cytoplasmic regions of Ror1 and Ror2 as bait (see “Experimental Procedures”). We identified Dlxin-1, a member of the MAGE family, as a candidate Ror1 and Ror2-interacting protein (22Masuda Y. Sasaki A. Shibuya H. Ueno N. Ikeda K. Watanabe K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5331-5338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) (data not shown). To test whether Dlxin-1 associates with intact Ror1 and/or Ror2 in mammalian cells, HA-tagged Dlxin-1 (full length) and FLAG-tagged Ror1 or Ror2 (full length) were co-expressed in HEK293T cells. As shown in Fig. 1A, HA-tagged Dlxin-1 specifically co-immunoprecipitated with FLAG-tagged Ror2, but not with FLAG-tagged Ror1, indicating that Ror2, but not Ror1, associates with Dlxin-1 in vivo. We next examined whether or not association of Ror2 with Dlxin-1 requires Ror2 kinase activity. To this end, HA-tagged Dlxin-1 along with either FLAG-tagged wild-type (WT) or a kinase-dead Ror2 mutant (Fig. 1B, Ror2 DK) were expressed in HEK293T cells, and their association was examined by anti-FLAG immunoprecipitation followed by anti-HA immunoblotting. As shown in Fig. 1C (left panel), Ror2 WT, but not Ror2 DK, was phosphorylated on tyrosine residues when overexpressed in 293T cells as revealed by anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblotting of anti-FLAG immunoprecipitates. It was found that both Ror2 WT and Ror2 DK could associate with Dlxin-1 to a similar extent (Fig. 1C, right panel), indicating that this association occurs independent of Ror2 kinase activity. It has been reported that CAM-1, a Caenorhabditis elegans ortholog of the Ror family RTKs, plays several important roles in regulating cellular migration, polarity of asymmetric cell divisions, and axonal outgrowth of neurons during nematode development. It has also been reported that the tyrosine kinase activity of CAN abnormal migration 1 (CAM-1) is required for some of these functions but not for its role in cellular migration (2Forrester W.C. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2002; 59: 83-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 34Forrester W.C. Dell M. Perens E. Garriga G. Nature. 1999; 400: 881-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that Ror2-associated Dlxin-1 may mediate the tyrosine kinase-independent function(s) of Ror2. Expression Patterns of Ror2 and Dlxin-1 Overlap during Mouse Embryogenesis—To verify the physiological significance of the Ror2-Dlxin-1 association observed in HEK293T cells, we compared the embryonic expression patterns of Ror1, Ror2, and Dlxin-1 by whole-mount in situ hybridization analyses on mouse embryos at E10.5 and E12.5 (Fig. 2, data not shown). At E10.5, Ror2 and Dlxin-1 exhibited remarkably similar expression patterns, especially in the pharyngeal arches and limb buds, whereas Ror1 transcripts exhibited a somewhat different pattern of localization (Fig. 2). Both Ror2 and Dlxin-1 were expressed throughout the limbs, whereas Ror1 expression was more restricted to the proximal regions of the limb buds. However, the expression patterns of these three transcripts were similar in the pharyngeal arches. At a later stage (E12.5), Dlxin-1, like Ror2, was expressed in the perichondrium of the digits and the marginal regions of the limbs; this overlapping expression pattern was maintained at E13.5 (Ref. 11Matsuda T. Nomi M. Ikeya M. Kani S. Oishi I. Terashima T. Takada S. Minami Y. Mech. Dev. 2001; 105: 153-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar; data not shown). On the other hand, Ror1 transcripts were detected in the anterior and posterior portions of the limbs (Ref. 11Matsuda T. Nomi M. Ikeya M. Kani S. Oishi I. Terashima T. Takada S. Minami Y. Mech. Dev. 2001; 105: 153-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar; data not shown). The results reveal that the expression patterns of Ror2 and Dlxin-1 overlap significantly, especially in the developing face and limbs. This suggests that Ror2 does indeed associate with Dlxin-1 during mouse embryogenesis. The C-terminal Proline-rich Domain of Ror2 and the C-terminal Necdin Homology Domain (NHD) of Dlxin-1 Are Required for the Association of Ror2 with Dlxin-1—To identify a region(s) within Ror2 that is required for its association with Dlxin-1, we generated two truncated mutants of Ror2: Ror2 ΔC and Ror2(Rob) (see Fig. 1B). Ror2 ΔC lacks the C-terminal amino acids 788–944, containing the Pro-rich and Ser/Thr-rich 2 domains, whereas Ror2(Rob) lacks amino acids 502–944, containing the Pro-rich, Ser/Thr-rich 1, and Ser/Thr-rich 2 domains and most of the kinase domain. We evaluated the abilities of these mutants to associate with Dlxin-1 in HEK293T cells. As shown in Fig. 3A, neither Ror2 ΔC nor Ror2(Rob) could associate with Dlxin-1, indicating that the C-terminal region of Ror2, containing the Pro-rich and Ser/Thr-rich 2 domains, is required for association. Although the cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase domains of Ror1 and Ror2 exhibit an amino acid identity of >70%, their C-terminal regions exhibit a lower degree of similarity (an amino acid identity of <30%). It should also be noted that Ror2 isolated from BDB patients exhibits frameshift and non-sense mutations that generate a truncated version of Ror2 lacking either the C-terminal proline-rich and serine/threonine-rich domains or the entire cytoplasmic region (15Oldridge M.

It has been reported that p75NTR associates with the rat ortholog of Dlxin-1 via the cytoplasmic juxtamembrane domain (amino acids 276–328) of p75NTR (24Salehi A.H. Roux P.P. Kubu C.J. Zeindler C.

However, no apparent amino acid sequence similarity was found between the cytoplasmic C-terminal region of Ror2 and the cytoplasmic juxtamembrane domain of p75NTR. It will be of interest to test whether Ror2 and p75NTR can compete for association with Dlxin-1 (NRAGE) in cells. Dlxin-1 belongs to the MAGE family of proteins, characterized by the presence of an NHD in their C-terminal portions (Refs. 22Masuda Y. Sasaki A. Shibuya H. Ueno N. Ikeda K. Watanabe K. J. Biol.

PPARα regulates energy combustion by serving as a key regulator of transcriptional pathways controlling fatty acid oxidation, whereas PPARγ functions as an important regulator of adipocyte differentiation and lipid storage (2Rosen E.D.

Nutr. 2001; 21: 193-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (739) Google Scholar). PPARγ is present in two major isoforms, PPARγ1 and PPARγ2, resulting from alternate promoter usage (4Zhu Y. Qi C. Korenberg J.R. Chen X.N. Noya D. Rao M.S. Reddy J.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7921-7925Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar). PPARγ2 contains additional 30 amino acids at the N-terminal end relative to PPARγ1, with PPARγ2 expression limited exclusively to adipose tissue where it plays a key role in adipogenesis (5Tontonoz P. Hu E. Spiegelman B.M. Cell. 1994; 79: 1147-1156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3122) Google Scholar). Recent studies have established that forced expression of PPARγ2 or PPARγ1 can stimulate the differentiation of fibroblasts to adipocytes, and in the process transcriptional pathways essential for the expression of adipocyte specific genes are activated resulting in lipid accumulation (6Mueller E. Dror S. Aiyer A. Yie J. Sarraf P. Chen H. Hauser S. Rosen E.D. Ge K. Roeder R.G. Spiegleman B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41925-41930Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Overexpression of PPARγ1 in mouse liver has also been shown to be sufficient for the induction of adipogenic transformation of hepatocytes with adipose tissue-specific gene expression and lipid accumulation (7Yu S. Matsusue K. Kashireddy P. Cao W-Q. Yeldandi Y. Yeldandi A.V. Rao M.S. Gonzalez F.J. Reddy J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 498-505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). In addition to PPARγ, CCAAT/enhancer binding family of transcription factors C/EBPα, -β, and -δ, also direct fibroblasts to differentiate into adipocytes (2Rosen E.D. Hsu C-H. Wang X. Sakai S. Freeman M.W. Gonzalez F.J. Spiegelman B.M. Gene Dev. 2000; 16: 22-26Crossref Scopus (1106) Google Scholar). The C/EBP-directed adipocyte conversion is mediated through down-stream regulator PPARγ (2Rosen E.D. Hsu C-H. Wang X. Sakai S. Freeman M.W. Gonzalez F.J. Spiegelman B.M. Gene Dev. 2000; 16: 22-26Crossref Scopus (1106) Google Scholar). Transcriptional activity of PPARγ and of other nuclear receptors is regulated by the binding of specific ligands and by the recruitment of nuclear receptor coactivators or coregulators (8McKenna N.J. O'Malley B.W. Cell. 2002; 108: 465-474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1253) Google Scholar, 9Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 121-141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The binding of ligands to nuclear receptors influences the recruitment of initial complex of coactivator proteins such as members of p160/SRC-1 family, and CREB-binding protein (CBP), which exhibit histone acteyltransferase activity necessary for remodeling chromatin (8McKenna N.J. O'Malley B.W. Cell. 2002; 108: 465-474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1253) Google Scholar, 9Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 121-141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Docking of other coactivators, either sequentially or combinatorially, manifests as a second multiprotein complex, variously referred to as TRAP-DRIP-ARC mediator complex, which facilitates interaction with RNA polymerase II complexes of the basal transcription machinery (10Yuan C.X.

Nature. 1999; 398: 828-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). This second complex, devoid of histone acetyltransferase activity, is anchored by PPARγ-binding protein (PBP), which was initially cloned as PPARγ-binding nuclear receptor coactivator (13Zhu Y. Qi C.

In addition, PRIP-interacting protein with RNA methyltransferase activity, designated PIMT (19Zhu Y. Qi C. Cao W-Q. Yeldandi A.V. Rao M.S. Reddy J.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Thus, the interactions of PRIP with CBP and TRAP130, and of PIMT with PRIP, CBP, and PBP raise the possibility that two major multiprotein cofactor complexes anchored by CBP/p300 and PBP, respectively, merge into one mega-complex on DNA template (21Surapureddi S.

Evidence obtained from gene knock-out studies has established that both PBP and PRIP null mutations lead to embryonic lethality, implying that these coactivators influence the physiological functions of many nuclear receptors and possibly other transcription factors (22Zhu Y.

Recent studies have also established the critical role for PBP/TRAP220 in PPARγ-stimulated adipogenesis in that PBP–/– mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were found refractory to adipocyte differentiation (27Ge K. Guermah M. Yuan C-X. Ito M. Wallberg A.E. Spiegleman B.M. Roeder R.G. Nature. 2002; 417: 563-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Since PRIP is also a PPARγ coactivator and the disruption of the PRIP gene resulted in lethal phenotype, it appeared necessary to investigate the role of this coactivator in PPARγ-stimulated adipogenesis. Here we show that PRIP–/– MEFs fail to exhibit PPARγ1-stimulated adipogenesis even in the presence of PBP, suggesting the need for the presence of both PBP and PRIP for PPARγ-directed adipogenesis. Construction of Retrovirus Vector—The retroviral vector expressing PPARγ1 was constructed by inserting mouse PPARγ1 cDNA isolated from PCMV-PPARγ1 into pMSCVneo and the construct was verified by sequencing. Pheonix ecotropic retrovirus packaging cells and PT67 cells (Clontech) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. Recombinant retroviruses were produced by transfecting Pheonix cells seeded at a density of 6 × 106 cells per 10-cm dish with 15 μg of retrovirus vector by LipofectAMINE 2000 reagent (Invitrogen). Twenty-four hours after transfection, the cells were changed to fresh medium and cultured for another 24 h. Virus-containing medium was then filtered through 0.45-μm membrane and added to 1 × 105 PT67 cells with 5 μg/ml polybrene (Sigma). Twenty-four hours after virus infection, the cells were selected with 200 μg/ml G418 containing medium for 8 days. Surviving PT67 cells were grown into confluence. Immortalization of Wild-type and PRIP –/– Embryonic Fibroblasts— Wild type and PRIP–/– primary MEFs were isolated from E11.5 littermate embryos as described (24Zhu Y.-J. Crawford S.E. Stellmach V.

Self-immortalization of the MEFs was achieved by re-plating the cells every 3 days at a density of 2.6 × 106 continuously for more than 5 months. PBP–/– MEFs were obtained as described previously (22Zhu Y. Qi C. Jia Y. Nye J.S. Rao M.S. Reddy J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14779-14782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Cell Culture, Retrovirus Infection of MEFs, and Induction of Adipogenesis—MEF cell lines were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. To infect MEFs with PPARγ retrovirus, 1 × 105 cells were grown for 24 h and changed to the medium collected from 10-cm plate of virus producing PT67 cells. Cells were incubated with retrovirus for 24 h and then cultured in fresh medium. Forty-eight hours after infection, cells were selected with 200 μg/ml G418 for 8 days. Induction of adipogenesis was carried out as described (5Tontonoz P. Hu E. Spiegelman B.M. Cell. 1994; 79: 1147-1156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3122) Google Scholar). Briefly, after cells grew into confluence, they were treated with culture medium containing 0.5 mm 3-isobutyl-1-methyl-xanthine (Sigma), 1 μm dexamethasone (Sigma), 5 μg/ml insulin (Sigma), and 0.5 μm rosiglitazone or Me2SO for 48 h. Cells were then changed to the medium containing 5 μg/ml insulin (Sigma) and 0.5 μm rosiglitazone or Me2SO. The induction lasted for 8 days with the medium being replaced every 2 days. The fat droplets in cells that exhibited adipogenesis were revealed by Oil Red staining. Northern Analysis and RT-PCR—Total RNA was extracted from cultured cells using TRIzol (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For Northern blotting, 20 μg of total RNA was used for each sample. To detect PBP mRNA in wild type and PRIP–/– MEFs, RT-PCR was carried out with primers 5′-TGTATCTGGCTCTCCAATCC-3′ and 5′-AGTGATGAGTTCATACAGGGG-3′ (4Zhu Y. Qi C. Korenberg J.R. Chen X.N. Noya D.

To detect PRIP mRNA in wild type and PBP–/– MEFs, RT-PCR was performed with primers 5′-TTTCATGGTGATGCAGCAGC-3′ and 5′-CATCATATTTGGTGGCCCGT-3′ (15Lee S-K. Anzick S.L. Choi J-E Bubendorf L. Guan X-Y.

Chromatin Protein Association Assays—For chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay, cells were cross-linked with 1% formaldyehyde at room temperature for 10 min and processed for the isolation of nuclei, which were then sonicated on ice to shear chromosomal DNA (28Weinman A.S. Farnham P.J. Methods (Orlando). 2002; 26: 37-47Google Scholar). After centrifugation, the supernatant was diluted 10-fold with dilution buffer (16.7 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.1, 1.1% Triton X-100, 1.2 mm EDTA, 167 mm NaCl) and precleared with preimmune serum-coupled protein A beads and salmon sperm DNA. Immunoprecipitation was performed by incubating the precleared cell lysate with specific antibody at 4 °C for 12 h.

To test the requirement of PRIP in PPARγ-mediated adipogenesis, immortalized MEF cell lines were established from E11.5 PRIP–/– embryos and their wild type littermates. PRIP–/– mouse embryos die between E11.5 and E12.5 (postcoitum) due in most part to defects in the development of placenta, heart, liver, nervous system, and retardation of embryonic growth (24Zhu Y.-J.

Wild type and PRIP–/– MEF cell lines were infected with retroviruses expressing PPARγ1 and then induced with differentiation medium containing PPARγ ligand rosiglitazone to maximize cell differentiation or vehicle (dimethyl sulfoxide) alone. Wild type MEFs expressing PPARγ1 and treated with rosiglitazone exhibited adipocyte conversion (Fig. 1, A and C). In contrast, retroviral expression of PPARγ1 failed to induce adipogenesis in PRIP–/– MEFs even in the presence of rosiglitazone (Fig. 1, B and D). Consistent with the morphological changes, mRNA and protein levels of adipocyte specific gene aP2 were markedly induced in wild type MEFs exhibiting adipogenesis, whereas aP2 mRNA and protein were not detectable in PRIP–/– MEFs that failed to reveal adipogenesis (Fig. 2, A and C). On Northern blotting, PPARγ1 mRNA level in PRIP–/– MEFs were at a higher level than that noted in the wild type MEFs showing the differentiated morphology (Fig. 2A). These results demonstrated that PPARγ1 was unable to stimulate adipogenesis in the absence of PRIP. Primary PRIP–/– MEFs also showed defects in PPARγ1-stimulated adipogenesis (data not shown).Fig. 2Analysis for adipogenic gene expression. A, Northern analysis for aP2 gene expression.

Ito M. Wallberg A.E. Spiegleman B.M. Roeder R.G. Nature. 2002; 417: 563-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Since PBP–/– MEFs have been shown to be defective in PPARγ2-stimulated adipogenesis, it was important to ascertain the relative levels of PBP mRNA in wild type and PRIP–/– MEFs (Fig. 2B). PBP mRNA levels, as assessed by RT-PCR, were essentially similar in wild type and PRIP–/– MEFs. There was also no difference in the level of PRIP mRNA expression in PBP–/– MEFs (Fig. 2B). These results indicate that the defects in PPARγ1-induced adipogenesis caused by the absence of PRIP and PBP are independent of each other. Recruitment of PBP, CBP, and PIMT to aP2 Gene Promoter in PRIP –/– MEFs during Adipogenesis—Transcriptional activation by PPARγ requires recruitment of nuclear receptor coactivator complexes to remodel chromosome structure and facilitate transcriptional initiation (8McKenna N.J.

To investigate the impact of the absence of PRIP on the ability of PPARγ to recruit coactivator complexes, ChIP assay was utilized to examine the association of aP2 gene promoter with coactivators in wild type and PRIP–/– MEFs that received adipogenesis treatment (Fig. 3). Using antibodies against PPARγ, PRIP, CBP, PIMT, or PBP, protein-DNA immune complexes were pulled down from cell lysates, and the DNA fragments in the complexes analyzed by PCR with primers (5′-AAATTCAGAAGAAAGTAAACACATTATT-3′ and 5′-ATGCCCTGACCATGTGA-3′) spanning the PPARγ-responsive element (AGGTCAAATGTGT) in the aP2 gene promoter region (29Hunt C.R.

The presence of endogenous PPARγ was detected on the aP2 promoter in wild type and PRIP–/– cells, and this association was prominent in the presence of ligand. PPARγ occupancy was increased by expressing exogenous PPARγ and addition of PPARγ ligand. Recruitment of CBP, and PBP to the aP2 promoter by PPARγ, was not visibly altered in PRIP–/– MEFs in response to retroviral expression of PPARγ1, whereas the recruitment of PIMT to the aP2 promoter in response to exogenous PPARγ1 was less robust in PRIP–/– cells (Fig. 3), suggesting that PRIP is needed for PIMT recruitment and for the formation of a large multiprotein transcriptional complex (20Misra P.

Interaction of Coactivators in PRIP –/– Cells—Nuclear receptor coactivators CBP/p300, PBP, PRIP, and PIMT function in concert to promote transcriptional activation (8McKenna N.J. O'Malley B.W.

It appears that PRIP and PRIP-binding protein PIMT serve as important linkers between CBP/p300- and PBP-anchored coactivator complexes (20Misra P. Qi C. Yu S. Shah S.H. Cao W-Q. Rao M.S.

To investigate the interaction of these coactivators in PRIP–/– cells, wild type and PRIP–/ –MEFs were infected with adenovirus expressing His-tagged PIMT (20Misra P. Qi C. Yu S. Shah S.H. Cao W-Q.

PIMT and its putative associated proteins were immunoprecipitated with anti-His antibodies, and the presence of CBP, p300, and PBP in the immunoprecipitate was detected by immunoblotting (Fig. 4). While the interaction of PIMT with PBP or p300 was not altered in PRIP–/– cells, binding of PIMT to CBP was weaker in PRIP–/– cells compared with wild type cells. In this study, we have examined the role of nuclear receptor coactivator PRIP in the PPARγ1-directed adipogenesis using wild type and PRIP–/– MEFs. Our findings provide evidence that PRIP is required for adipocyte differentiation and for the expression of adipocyte specific aP2 gene. The refractoriness of PRIP–/– MEFs to PPARγ-stimulated adipogenesis is similar to that described for PBP/TRAP220–/– MEFs (27Ge K. Guermah M. Yuan C-X. Ito M. Wallberg A.E. Spiegleman B.M. Roeder R.G. Nature. 2002; 417: 563-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar), suggesting that both PRIP and PBP play important roles in mediating the adipocyte differentiating effects of PPARγ. These two coactivators were isolated using PPARγ as bait in the yeast two-hybrid screen and were identified as coactivators for PPARγ and other nuclear receptors (13Zhu Y. Qi C. Jain S. Rao M.S.

The embryonic lethality observed with the disruption of PBP and PRIP genes and the failure of MEFs derived from the PBP and PRIP null mutants to differentiate into adipocytes under PPARγ stimulation suggest that both PBP and PRIP are vital for the successful completion of transcriptional activity of several genes involved in adipogenesis and possibly in the development and differentiation necessary for ontogeny. The mechanism for the failure of PRIP–/– MEFs to undergo PPARγ1-stimulated adipogenesis may involve inadequate docking or linkage between CBP/p300-anchored coactivators with PBP-anchored TRAP-DRIP-ARC-PRIC multiprotein complex. Since PRIP binds CBP/p300 and TRAP/DRIP130, a component of TRAP complex, the absence of PRIP most likely interferes with linkage of CBP/p300-anchored coactivator complex with PBP-anchored complex, thus curtailing the transcriptional signaling (18Ko L. Cardona G.R. Chin W.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6212-6217Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 20Misra P. Qi C. Yu S. Shah S.H. Cao W-Q. Rao M.S. Thimmapaya B. Reddy J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20011-20019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Absence of PRIP might further interfere with these protein-protein interactions because PRIP binding protein PIMT directly binds with both CBP/p300 and PBP (20Misra P. Qi C. Yu S. Shah S.H. Cao W-Q. Rao M.S. Thimmapaya B. Reddy J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20011-20019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Interestingly, ChIP assays revealed reductions in PIMT recruitment to the aP2 promoter in response to exogenous PPARγ1, implying that PRIP is needed to recruit PIMT to the coactivator complex. ChIP assays also revealed reduction in exogenous PPARγ1 recruitment to aP2 promoter in PRIP–/– MEFs (Fig. 3). This may be due to the requirement of PRIP for the stable formation of PPARγ1-RXR heterodimers on the aP2 promoter or reduced amount of RXR in PRIP–/– MEFs in that PRIP–/– MEFs were shown to exhibit marked repression of RXR-mediated transcriptional activity (24Zhu Y.-J.

Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting data reveal that in PRIP–/– MEFs the binding of CBP to PIMT is reduced, and this may also have functional implications. It is now well established that PPARγ and C/EBPα are critical transcription factors in adipogenesis (1Hihi A.K. Michalik L. Wahli W. Cell Mol. Life. Sci. 2002; 59: 790-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 2Rosen E.D. Hsu C-H. Wang X. Sakai S. Freeman M.W. Gonzalez F.J. Spiegelman B.M. Gene Dev. 2000; 16: 22-26Crossref Scopus (1106) Google Scholar). Genetic analysis of adipogenesis has revealed that PPARγ promotes adipogenesis in C/EBPα-deficient cells, but the converse is not true in that C/EBPα has no ability to promote adipogenesis in the absence of PPARγ (2Rosen E.D. Hsu C-H. Wang X. Sakai S. Freeman M.W. Gonzalez F.J. Spiegelman B.M. Gene Dev. 2000; 16: 22-26Crossref Scopus (1106) Google Scholar). The studies of Ge and co-workers (27Ge K. Guermah M. Yuan C-X. Ito M. Wallberg A.E. Spiegleman B.M. Roeder R.G. Nature. 2002; 417: 563-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar) with PBP–/– MEFs, and the observations reported here using PRIP–/– MEFs clearly establish the importance of these two coactivators in PPARγ-stimulated adipogenesis. These two coactivators appear to function as downstream effectors of PPARγ, and both are required for the successful completion of the adipogenic program. This assumption is based on the observation that PRIP–/– MEFs used in this study express PBP (Fig. 2B). Likewise PBP–/– MEFs also express PRIP mRNA to the same level as wild type MEFs, and the absence of either one of these coactivators interferes with PPARγ-stimulated adipogenesis. In essence, lack of PBP may result in the disruption of TRAP-DRIP-ARC-PRIC complex formation and absence of PRIP may interfere with the linkage and passage of transcriptional signal through the combined CBP/p300- and PBP-anchored complex. Additional studies are needed to assess the role of PRIP in in vivo adipogenesis using PRIP conditional null mice."

Although it is of multifactorial origin, the disease develops at preferential sites along the vasculature in regions experiencing specific hemodynamic conditions that are predisposed to endothelial dysfunction. The exact mechanisms allowing endothelial cells to discriminate between plaque-free and plaque-prone flows remain to be explored. To investigate such mechanisms, we performed a proteomic analysis on endothelial cells exposed in vitro to these two-flow patterns. A few spots on the two-dimensional gel had an intensity that was differentially regulated by plaque-free versus plaque-prone flows. One of them was further investigated and identified as macrophage-capping protein (Cap G), a member of the gelsolin protein superfamily. A 2-fold increase of Cap G protein and a 5-fold increase of Cap G mRNA were observed in cells exposed to a plaque-free flow as compared with static cultures. This increase was not observed in cells exposed to plaque-prone flow. Plaque-free flow induced a corresponding increase in nuclear and cytoskeletal-associated Cap G. Finally, overexpression of Cap G in transfection assays increased the motility potential of endothelial cells. These observations together with the known functions of Cap G suggest that Cap G may contribute to the protective effect exerted by plaque-free flow on endothelial cells. On the contrary, in cells exposed to a plaque-prone flow, no induction of Cap G expression could be observed.

Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 519-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (2285) Google Scholar). The disturbance of endothelial homeostasis can lead to endothelial dysfunction, triggering several pathological processes including atherosclerosis. Hemodynamic forces have been shown to play a preponderant role in regulating cell function and structure in the endothelium. Among these forces, shear stress represents a major stimulus. Localization of atherosclerotic plaques is correlated with regions characterized by a flow with low mean shear stress values and a cyclic reversal flow direction (named also oscillatory flow) (2Ku D.N. Giddens D.P. Zarins C.K. Glagov S. Arteriosclerosis. 1985; 5: 293-302Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Glagov S. Zarins C. Giddens D.P. Ku D.N. Arch. Pathol. Lab.

This contrasts with plaque-free sections where ECs are exposed to unidirectional shear stress. However, little is known regarding the mechanism by which this particular environment might predispose the endothelium to damage. Interestingly, the expression of several genes has been shown to be differentially regulated by unidirectional and oscillatory flow. Unidirectional shear stress increases expression of proteins involved in adaptive process to reduce flow-induced endothelium damage as shown by the up-regulation of endothelial nitric-oxide synthase gene expression (5Ziegler T.

Nitric Oxide. 2000; 4: 47-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In contrast, oscillatory shear stress induces expression of genes implied in the development of plaques such as the vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 or endothelin-1 growth factor (6Ziegler T.

Alexander R.W. Circ. Res. 1998; 82: 532-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). Endothelial morphology is also influenced by the prevailing hemodynamic conditions. Indeed, unidirectional but not oscillatory shear stress induces an elongation and an alignment of ECs in flow direction through actin assembly and reorganization (6Ziegler T. Bouzourene K.

Modulation of these signaling molecules is necessary to induce a complex cytoskeletal reorganization that includes formation of actin-stress fibers and that is necessary for cellular morphology changes. Therefore, mechanotransduction mechanisms leading to cytoskeletal dynamic changes are strongly suggested to imply a large number of actin-binding proteins. Among these binding proteins, the gelsolin family can control many aspects of actin organization by severing filament ends and nucleating actin assembly (14Yin H.L. Bioessays. 1987; 7: 176-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Gelsolin is the founding member of this family that now contains six members: gelsolin, villin, adseverin, macrophage-capping protein (Cap G), advillin, and supervillin (15Sun H.Q. Yamamoto M. Mejillano M. Yin H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33179-33182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). In contrast to gelsolin, Cap G binds and caps actin filament but does not sever them (16Yu F.X. Johnston P.A. Sudhof T.C. Yin H.L. Science. 1990; 250: 1413-1415Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 17Yu F.X. Zhou D.M. Yin H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19269-19275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Its binding to actin is reversible by reducing Ca2+ concentration (18Kwiatkowski D.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Indeed, Cap G rapidly dissociates from the barbed end of actin when Ca2+ concentration becomes submicromolar (14Yin H.L. Bioessays. 1987; 7: 176-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Cap G and gelsolin also differentiate themselves by their cellular distribution. Whereas gelsolin is exclusively present in the cytoplasm, Cap G has been found in the nuclei (19Onoda K. Yu F.X. Yin H.L. Cell. Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1993; 26: 227-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Moreover, phosphorylated Cap G is preferentially associated with nuclear location (20Onoda K. Yin H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4106-4112Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Studies of gelsolin knock-out cells suggest that this protein regulates morphology of stress fibers, facilitates the wound healing responses, and enhances chemotaxis (18Kwiatkowski D.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar, 21Cunningham C.C. Stossel T.P. Kwiatkowski D.J. Science. 1991; 251: 1233-1236Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Understanding the mechanisms responsible for the selective sensitivity of ECs to different hemodynamic environments could allow us to get new insights into the development of atherogenesis. Taking advantage of our unique perfusion system combining shear stress, hoop stretch, and pressure (22Zhao S. Suciu A. Ziegler T. Moore Jr., J.E. Burki E. Meister J.J. Brunner H.R. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1995; 15: 1781-1786Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) in association with a proteomic analysis, we identify Cap G as a novel differentially regulated gene. Indeed, Cap G gene expression is induced in ECs exposed to plaque-free flow, whereas a plaque-prone flow (oscillatory flow) fails to induce such expression. We also demonstrated that unidirectional flow, but not oscillatory flow, increases the association of Cap G with the cytoskeleton and Cap G nuclear location. Moreover, overexpression of Cap G enhances EC-migrating capacities. Taken together, these observations suggest a key role of Cap G in the signaling pathway triggered by unidirectional flow and also in the increased wound healing facility of plaque-free regions. Bovine aorta endothelial cells (BAECs) were isolated from aorta as described previously (6Ziegler T. Bouzourene K. Harrison V.J. Brunner H.R. Hayoz D. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1998; 18: 686-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Cells were grown in low glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Amimed) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Amimed), 4 mmol/liter GLUTAMAX (Invitrogen), 10 mg/ml streptomycin, and 100 IU/ml penicillin (Invitrogen). Cells were used between passages 3 and 5. The system has been described in more detail elsewhere (6Ziegler T. Bouzourene K. Harrison V.J. Brunner H.R. Hayoz D. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1998; 18: 686-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar, 22Zhao S. Suciu A. Ziegler T. Moore Jr., J.E. Burki E. Meister J.J. Brunner H.R. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1995; 15: 1781-1786Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). It is composed of compliant tubes coated with 20 μg/ml bovine fibronectin and seeded with ECs. Tubes were mounted onto specially designed fittings. When cells formed a confluent monolayer, they were inserted in a perfusion loop composed of a medium reservoir and a gear pump (Ismatec). The pump is controlled by a function generator (Hewlett Packard) to produce a 1-Hz sinusoidal flow rate. Reservoir medium is composed of culture medium supplemented with 2% dextran (M r = 70 000) (Sigma) to increase the viscosity to 1.07 × 10–3n m–2·s–1. The reservoir is constantly gassed by a 10% CO2, 90% air mixture to keep a constant pH of 7.2. Both reservoir and fittings were kept at a constant temperature of 37 °C in a water bath. Cells were exposed to unidirectional flow (6 ± 3 or 0.3 ± 0.1 dynes/cm2) or alternatively to oscillatory flow (0.3 ± 3 dynes/cm2). Pressure mean value was maintained to 100 mmHg. At the end of the experiment, cells were harvested by trypsin digestion and further processed. Two-dimensional Electrophoresis—Cells were harvested in RSB buffer (7 mol/liter urea, 2 mol/liter thiourea, 4% CHAPS, 1.25% Servalyt 3–10). For each sample, 100 μg of proteins were resolved on a two-dimensional gel. First dimension was performed using immobilized pI gradient (Bio-Rad). Samples were loaded in gel overnight and further processed on an isoelectric focusing device (Bio-Rad). A total of 35,000 V was applied to each strip. Proteins were then separated on a 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Gels were silver-stained and scanned using a Full cover G12D personal densitometer laser PD-SI (Amersham Biosciences). Gel image files were directly imported in Melanie II software (Genebio). Reference standards for molecular weight (Sigma) and isoelectric point (Amersham Biosciences) were used to characterize the detected spots. The spot number 507 was isolated from a preparative gel loaded with 500 μg of total protein lysate. In this gel, proteins were revealed using Gel Blue Code (Pierce) and subsequent washes in water. The spot was excised from the gel and sent to M-Scan (Plan-les-Ouates, Switzerland) to be further characterized by mass spectrometry and MS/MS sequencing. Identification and Cloning of Bovine Cap G cDNA—Bovine Cap G cDNA has been identified through in silico screening of GenBank™ databases (BLAST algorithm: National Center for Biotechnology Information, www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/). Conventional cDNA cloning was achieved by PCR using BAEC cells as a source of template. The designed primers were forward primer, 5′-AACAGATCCAGAAACAGCATGTACT-3′, and reverse primer, 5′-ACTGACCAGAAGGTCAGAGGAGGAG-3′). The amplification was performed with a proofreading enzyme (Qiagen). The resulting blunt-ended fragment was then cloned into the vector pCR®-Blunt II-TOPO® vector (Invitrogen) as detailed in the manufacturer's protocol. Two different clones were sent for sequencing. The open reading frame and amino acid sequence were predicted using the translate tool (www.infobiogen.fr/services/analyseq/cgi-bin/traduc_in.pl). The predicted bovine Cap G protein was aligned with the orthologous Cap G from human and mouse using the ClustalW (www.infobiogen.fr/services/analyseq/cgi-bin/clustalw_in.pl) and Boxshade 3.21 programs (www.ch.embnet.org/software/BOX_form.html). Immunoblotting—After lysis in RIPA buffer (1% deoxycholic acid, 0.15 mmol/liter NaCl, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.01 mmol/liter sodium phosphate, 2 mmol/liter EDTA, protease inhibitor mixture, pH 7.4), protein concentrations were determined according to Bradford method. 10 μg of soluble proteins were run in a 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (ECL nitrocellulose, Amersham Biosciences). Specific antibodies were used to detect Cap G (rabbit polyclonal), eGFP (mouse monoclonal, 3E6, Molecular Probes), and β-actin (mouse monoclonal, AAN02, Cytoskeleton) protein levels by immunoblotting. Hybridization was performed in blotting buffer (Tris 20 mmol/liter, pH 7.6, 0.1% Tween 20, 5% dry milk) for 18 h at 4 °C. First antibody was revealed using anti-rabbit or anti-mouse secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Biosciences) and a chemiluminescent detection system (Amersham Biosciences). Immunofluorescence—Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline for 3 min. We then incubated the cells with a specific antibody for Cap G (1:200 dilution in phosphate-buffered saline containing 10% of normal goat serum). After washing, cells were incubated in the presence of a goat anti-rabbit IgG rhodamine-conjugated antibody (1:100 dilution in phosphate-buffered saline containing 10% normal goat serum, Calbiochem). Cells were then analyzed for red and green fluorescence. RNA Preparation and Northern Blot Analysis—RNA was extracted from trypsinized cells using RNeasy kit (Qiagen). 5 μg of total RNA were separated on 1.2% agarose, 2.2 mol/liter formaldehyde gel, transferred to a Biodyne A membrane (Pall), and hybridized with radiolabeled cDNA probe spanning the human Cap G sequence. After hybridization, membranes were washed in 2× SSC (1× SSC = 150 mmol/liter NaCl, 15 mmol/liter trisodium citrate dehydrate) for 5 min at room temperature and then once in 0.5× SSC, 1% SDS for 30 min at 65 °C. Transcript levels were quantified using an electronic autoradiography apparatus (Instant Imager, Packard) and normalized to the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase signal. Differential Detergent Fractionation—Subcellular fractionation was performed essentially as described by Ramsby and Makowski (23Ramsby M.L. Makowski G.S. Methods Mol. Biol. 1999; 112: 53-66PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were permeabilized using ice-cold 0.015% digitonin, 400 mmol/liter sucrose, 100 mmol/liter NaCl, 10 mmol/liter PIPES, pH 6.8, for 10 min. Extraction mixture was then centrifuged at 480 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and supernatant containing cytosolic fraction was removed. Digitonin-insoluble pellets were resuspended in ice-cold 0.5% Triton X-100, 400 mmol/liter sucrose, 100 mmol/liter NaCl, 10 mmol/liter PIPES, pH 7.4, for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant (membrane fraction) was collected by centrifugation at 500 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Nuclear fraction was obtained resuspending pellet in 0.5% deoxycholic acid, 1% Tween 40, 5 mmol/liter PIPES, 0.5 mmol/liter MgCl2. After centrifugation at 6780 × g for 10 min, insoluble fraction representing cytoskeletal fraction was resuspended in 0.5% SDS, 10 mmol/liter sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. All of the buffers were supplemented with EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). Transfection and Cell Motility Assay—Cap G cDNA mouse was inserted into pIRES2-eGFP plasmid (Clontech). Transfection into BAECs was performed using FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Applied Science) following manufacturer's instructions. A ratio of 3 ml of FuGENE 6 for 1 mg of DNA was used. Cells were analyzed 24 h after transfection. Transfection efficiency was determined by cytofluorometry after transfection with pIRES2-eGFP plasmid. Cell migration was evaluated using a modified Boyden chamber assay (Chemicon). Transfected cells (2.5 × 105 cells/well) were placed inside the chamber and allowed to migrate for 24 h through 8 μm pore membrane. Migrated cells were then stained and counted and then analyzed for fluorescence. Statistical Analysis—Data are expressed as means ± S.D. Variance analysis was performed using ANOVA. Comparison between groups was performed using Student's t test. p values < 0.05 were considered significant. Increased Cap G Expression in ECs Exposed to a Plaque-free Flow—To investigate differential effect of plaque-free versus plaque-prone flow on protein expression, we performed two-dimensional gel electrophoresis on total protein lysates of ECs exposed to these flow patterns. Four two-dimensional gels for each condition (static, 0.3 ± 0.1, 6 ± 3, and 0.3 ± 3 dynes/cm2) were considered. This analysis allowed us to resolve approximately 2500 protein spots (Fig. 1A). Among them, the intensities of spots numbered 69, 507, 759, and 926 were shown to be differentially regulated by unidirectional and oscillatory flow (Fig. 1B). We decided to further investigate the identity of spot number 507 corresponding to an acidic protein with an estimated isoelectric point (pI) of 6.35 and an apparent molecular mass of 38,975 Da. This choice was based on the clear difference of spot intensity in cells exposed to unidirectional flow as compared with cells exposed to oscillatory flow and on the relative high amount of this protein present in extracts of cells maintained in static cultures that was favorable for further analysis. Protein corresponding to spot 507 has been identified by mass spectrometry coupled to nanosequencing of two tryptic peptides derived from trypsin digestion. Amino acid sequences revealed a 100% homology with human Cap G. To confirm the two-dimensional gel data, anti-Cap G antibodies were used in Western blot analysis. As expected, Cap G level increases in BAECs exposed to unidirectional shear stress for 24 h (Fig. 2A). Cap G protein level was significantly induced in cells exposed to higher unidirectional shear stress, whereas oscillatory flow failed to induce its expression (Fig. 2A). Kinetic studies of Cap G protein induction by unidirectional shear stress revealed a first induction after 4 h of flow exposure (6 ± 3 dynes/cm2) and reached a maximum after 24 h (Fig. 2B). To monitor whether differential Cap G gene expression also occurred at the mRNA level, cells were exposed to unidirectional or oscillatory flow for 24 h and Cap G transcript levels were revealed by Northern blot using a human cDNA probe. Expression levels in cells exposed to flow for 24 h were compared with that observed in static conditions. Low shear stress 0.3 ± 0.1 dynes/cm2 induced a 3.0-fold increase in Cap G mRNA, whereas higher level of pulsatile unidirectional flow (6 ± 3 dynes/cm2) mediated a 5.8-fold increase in Cap G mRNA expression as compared with static conditions (Fig. 3, A and B). As it was the case at the protein level, oscillatory flow failed to induce an increase in Cap G mRNA level. Identification and Cloning of Bovine Cap G cDNA—Using the human Cap G cDNA sequence NM_001747 as query sequence, we performed a BLAST analysis of ESTs in GenBank™ databases and picked up all of the related bovine ESTs. Among these ESTs, four were specifically chosen and analyzed for overlapping to generate a single sequence of 1240 base pairs (GenBank™ accession numbers BI976967, BE757273, AV607336, and AV617452) (Fig. 4A). The complete nucleotide sequence has been reported in GenBank™ as AY219899. To verify that this mRNA is expressed in BAECs, we designed oligonucleotide primers encompassing the putative start and stop codons. A fragment of 1064 base pairs was amplified by PCR from BAEC cells (Fig. 4B). The isolated cDNA was then subcloned into pCR-Blunt II-TOPO®. Two different clones were sequenced. The cDNA sequences were identical to that predicted by bioinformatical tools. The cDNA contained an open reading frame from nucleotide 96 (putative start codon) to nucleotide 1143 (putative stop codon) capable of encoding a 349-amino acid polypeptide with a predicted molecular mass of 39 kDa (Fig. 4A). BLAST analysis in protein databases predicted three conserved domains reported as gelsolin domains (amino acids position: gelsolin 1-(19–110); gelsolin 2-(139–228); gelsolin 3-(253–348)). To validate the predicted amino acid sequence of the bovine Cap G protein, we have searched the two peptides sequenced from mass spectrometry in our sequence. The two peptides sequenced by MS/MS following two-dimensional gel electrophoresis separation were located at the carboxyl-terminal region of the protein (peptide 1-(310–315) and peptide 2-(325–332)). Alignment of bovine Cap G protein with its ortholog from human and mouse is shown in Fig. 4C. Bovine Cap G protein shows a high level of homology to human Cap G (92% identity and 95% similarity) and mouse Cap G (91% identity and 96% similarity) proteins. Unidirectional Flow Mediates Cap G Cellular Redistribution—Differential detergent fractionation of ECs revealed the presence of Cap G in all of the fractions but predominantly in the nuclear fraction (cytosol 18.1 ± 3.3%; membrane 28.1 ± 3.3%; nuclear 37.1 ± 1.0%; and cytoskeletal 15.8 ± 0.8%). To investigate whether unidirectional shear stress influenced cellular Cap G association to the cytoskeleton, cells were exposed to different flow conditions prior to being lysed using a differential detergent fractionation method. Cytoskeletal-associated Cap G increased rapidly and was already visible after 2 h of flow exposure (Fig. 5). This association was maintained in time and was still present after 24 h of unidirectional flow exposure. Moreover, 24 h of exposure to oscillatory shear stress failed to induce Cap G cytoskeletal association (Fig. 5). Interestingly, Cap G level in the nuclear fraction also increased in cells exposed to unidirectional shear stress for 24 h. As it was the case for the cytoskeletal-associated Cap G, no increase was observed in cells exposed for 24 h to an oscillatory shear stress (Fig. 5). Cytosolic and membrane-associated Cap G levels remained similar to static levels at all of the time points considered in cells exposed to both unidirectional and oscillatory shear stress (Fig. 5). Transient Cap G Overexpression Mediates BAECs Motility— To address the role of Cap G in BAECs motility, cells were transfected with a bicistronic vector (pCap G-IRES-eGFP, Clontech) containing a cytomegalovirus promoter driving the expression of Cap G and eGFP cDNA and with the same bicistronic vector containing only the eGFP cDNA as a control (Fig. 6A). The experimental protocol used allows us to transiently transfect approximately 35% cells (data not shown). Overexpression of Cap G in transfected cells was demonstrated by immunoblotting. Cap G was shown to be overexpressed only in cells transfected with Cap G cDNA-containing expression vector, whereas eGFP was expressed also in cells transfected with control vector (Fig. 6B). β-Actin detection was used to prove equal protein loading in the different lanes. These data were also confirmed by immunofluorescence study (Fig. 6C). To test motility capacities, transfected cells were distributed in the Boyden chambers and motility was measured 24 h later as the rate of cell migration through membrane pores. The number of migrating cells is significantly increased when cells have been previously transfected with Cap G-expressing vector as compared with untransfected cells and to cells transfected with the expression vector carrying eGFP cDNA alone (Fig. 6D). Moreover, when BAECs were transfected with the expressing vector containing both Cap G and eGFP cDNAs, 39% of the migrating cells exhibited green fluorescence emission (Fig. 6E), further supporting the assumption that all of the transfected cells overexpressing Cap G were migrating. Atherosclerotic plaques preferentially develop where vasculature is exposed to a particular flow pattern corresponding to low mean shear stress values and a cyclic reversal of flow direction. This flow pattern is in contrast to that observed in regions protected against plaque development, which is characterized by a unidirectional feature and higher levels of shear stress (2Ku D.N. Giddens D.P. Zarins C.K. Glagov S. Arteriosclerosis. 1985; 5: 293-302Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Glagov S. Zarins C. Giddens D.P. Ku D.N. Arch. Pathol. Lab.

Ku D.N. J. Biomech. Eng. 1996; 118: 74-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). Recently, the importance of the hemodynamic forces on ECs has become evident, both at the level of cell morphology as well as at the level of gene expression (1Davies P.F. Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 519-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (2285) Google Scholar, 4Davies P.F. Shi C. Depaola N. Helmke B.P. Polacek D.C. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2001; 947: 7-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Moreover, it has been demonstrated that different hemodynamic conditions reproduced in in vitro experiments induce opposite effect on ECs, particularly in the context of endothelial nitric-oxide synthase, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, and growth factor gene expression (5Ziegler T. Silacci P. Harrison V.J. Hayoz D. Hypertension. 1998; 32: 351-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 6Ziegler T. Bouzourene K. Harrison V.J. Brunner H.R. Hayoz D. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1998; 18: 686-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar, 8Chappell D.C. Varner S.E. Nerem R.M. Medford R.M. Alexander R.W. Circ. Res. 1998; 82: 532-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar, 26Harrison V.J. Ziegler T. Bouzourene K. Suciu A. Silacci P. Hayoz D. J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol. 1998; 31: S38-S41Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). All of these data suggest that unidirectional flow, typical of plaque-free areas, exerts a “protective” effect on endothelial cells. On the contrary, oscillatory flow encountered at plaque-prone areas appears to influence the preferential development of atherosclerotic plaques due to either the absence of a protective effect or the activation of a predisposing deleterious process. Despite this well accepted hypothesis, no data are so far available on the mechanisms allowing ECs to discriminate between a plaque-free and a plaque-prone flow. To investigate some of these mechanisms, we analyzed the protein patterns in cells exposed to hemodynamic conditions mimicking plaque-free and plaque-prone flows. We used a perfusion system combining shear stress, hoop stretch, and pressure in order to reproduce hemodynamic conditions closed to physiological situations (22Zhao S. Suciu A. Ziegler T. Moore Jr., J.E. Burki E. Meister J.J. Brunner H.R. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1995; 15: 1781-1786Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The two-dimensional gel electrophoresis analysis revealed several protein spots with intensity differentially regulated by unidirectional (plaque-free) versus oscillatory (plaque-prone) flows (Fig. 1). One of these spots, further characterized by mass spectrometry and peptide nanosequencing, revealed a 100% homology with macrophage-capping protein or Cap G protein, which is a member of the villin/gelsolin family (15Sun H.Q. Yamamoto M. Mejillano M. Yin H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33179-33182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). Up-regulation of Cap G expression by unidirectional shear stress was confirmed by immunoblotting and Northern blot analysis (Figs. 2 and 3). Induction of mRNA level was more important than that observed for Cap G protein. This apparent paradox may be explained by an inefficient Cap G extraction using RIPA buffer. This hypothesis is supported by the total induction of Cap G protein observed using differential detergent fractionation. Indeed, adding induction folds observed in the cytoskeletal fraction with that observed in the nuclear fraction, a total induction of approximately 5-fold is obtained in cells exposed to high unidirectional shear stress (Fig. 5). This result is more consistent with the induction observed at the mRNA level (Fig. 3). Cloning and sequencing of bovine Cap G sequence confirmed the conserved structure of Cap G containing three gelsolin-like domains. A comparison with murine and human sequences revealed a great conservation of both amino acids and nucleotides sequences (Fig. 4C). Analysis of cellular distribution in fibroblast shows that Cap G is mainly associated with the nucleus and the membrane (19Onoda K. Yu F.X. Yin H.L. Cell. Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1993; 26: 227-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Similar to the other members of the gelsolin family, Cap G, which is a Ca2+-sensitive actin-binding protein, has a capping activity inhibiting polymerization of actin filaments (16Yu F.X. Johnston P.A. Sudhof T.C. Yin H.L. Science. 1990; 250: 1413-1415Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) and actively participates in the remodeling of the cytoskeleton. Increase in cytoskeleton-associated Cap G in cells exposed to unidirectional flow is rapid and can be observed already after 2 h of flow exposure (Fig. 5). This enrichment in cytoskeleton-associated Cap G is consistent with a putative role of Cap G in the modulation of cytoskeletal reorganization induced by unidirectional shear stress (9Malek A.M. Izumo S. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 713-726Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), leading to cell alignment in flow direction. Moreover, flow-induced cytoskeletal reorganization as well as cellular alignment in the direction of flow are Ca2+-dependent processes similar to Cap G actin binding activity (9Malek A.M. Izumo S. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 713-726Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Pantaloni D. Le Clainche C. Carlier M.F. Science. 2001; 292: 1502-1506Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar, 28Carlier M.F. Ressad F. Pantaloni D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33827-33830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 29Carlier M.F. Pantaloni D. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 269: 459-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar) and therefore further support an involvement of Cap G in these processes. In addition, oscillatory flow, which fails to trigger morphological changes in ECs (6Ziegler T. Bouzourene K. Harrison V.J. Brunner H.R. Hayoz D. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1998; 18: 686-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar), also fails to induce such an increase in cytoskeleton-associated Cap G level (Fig. 5), thus supporting this hypothesis. However, the exact mechanisms by which proteins of the villin/gelsolin family may act on flow-induced cytoskeletal reorganization are not completely elucidated. Unidirectional flow also increases level of Cap G associated with the nucleus (Fig. 5). Nuclear Cap G increase is observed mainly after 24 of exposure to unidirectional shear stress. Nuclear location of Cap G as well as the functional role of this increase in nuclear Cap G by unidirectional flow remains to be elucidated, but recent reports (30Lu P.J. Hsu A.L. Wang D.S. Yan H.Y. Yin H.L. Chen C.S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5738-5745Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 31Anderson R.A. Boronenkov I.V. Doughman S.D. Kunz J. Loijens J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9907-9910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 32Chi T.H. Crabtree G.R. Science. 2000; 287: 1937-1939Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) suggest the existence of a nuclear phosphoinositide signaling pathways. This observation, together with the known capacity of Cap G to bind phosphatidylinositol 4,5-biphosphate and therefore to influence phospho-lipase C activity (30Lu P.J. Hsu A.L. Wang D.S. Yan H.Y. Yin H.L. Chen C.S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5738-5745Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), is consistent with the contribution of Cap G in the modulation of this signaling pathway in cells exposed to flow. Moreover, Cap G could act on gene transcription by directly binding to DNA as would be suggested by the presence of a c-Myc-like DNA-binding domain (33Prendergast G.C. Ziff E.B. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 757-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The other important observation of this study is that plaque-prone flow failed to induce an increase in nuclear-associated Cap G level. Despite the lack of severing activity (16Yu F.X. Johnston P.A.

Wooten D.C. Yin H.L. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 147-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Moreover, Cap G null macrophages display marked defects on actin-based motile function (35Witke W. Li W. Kwiatkowski D.J. Southwick F.S. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 775-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). To address Cap G influence on the motility properties of ECs, we have transiently transfected BAECs with a bicistronic vector expressing Cap G and eGFP. Overexpression of Cap G protein in these cells was proven by immunoblotting (Fig. 6B) and by immunofluorescence (Fig. 6C). The number of migrating cells, as assessed using Boyden chambers, is increased in Cap G overexpressing cells, and the increase in the number of migrating cells corresponds to the number of fluorescence-exhibiting cells, proving that the observed effects are not due to artifacts linked to transfection protocol but result from Cap G overexpression (Fig. 6E). This observation suggests that in areas of the vasculature exposed to a plaque-free flow, the wound-healing process may be accelerated in response to increased Cap G gene expression. Indeed, the wound-healing process has been demonstrated to be accelerated by unidirectional flow (36Vyalov S. Langille B.L. Gotlieb A.I. Am. J. Pathol. 1996; 149: 2107-2118PubMed Google Scholar); however, the mechanisms remain unknown. In conclusion, we provide evidence that Cap G is a good candidate to participate to the differential EC sensitivity to plaque-free versus plaque-prone flows. Moreover, based on the observations reported here as well as on the different known activities of Cap G, this protein may act at several levels including cytoskeletal reorganization, gene transcription, and modulation of the signaling pathways. Further investigations will be necessary to assess the roles of Cap G processes and to elucidate the functional role of nuclear Cap G."

The conserved checkpoint kinase, Chk1, regulates mitotic progression in response to DNA damage by blocking the activation of Cdk1/cyclin B. In this study, we investigate the regulatory interaction between Chk1 and members of the Atm family of kinases and the functional role of the C-terminal non-catalytic domains of Chk1. Chk1 stimulates the kinase activity of DNA-PK (protein kinase) complexes, which leads to increased phosphorylation of p53 on Ser-15 and Ser-37. In addition, Chk1 stimulates DNA-PK-dependent end-joining reactions in vitro. We also show that Chk1 protein complexes bind to single-stranded DNA and DNA ends. These results indicate a connection between components that regulate the checkpoint pathways and DNA-PK complex proteins, which have a role in the repair of double strand breaks.

These results indicate a connection between components that regulate the checkpoint pathways and DNA-PK complex proteins, which have a role in the repair of double strand breaks. In response to DNA damage and replication interference, cells activate signal transduction pathways known as checkpoints that prevent cell cycle progression and induce the transcription of genes that facilitate DNA repair (1Weinert T. Cell. 1998; 94: 555-558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 2Zhou B.B. Elledge S.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 433-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (2645) Google Scholar). These responses ensure that DNA replication and chromosome segregation are completed with high fidelity. Defects in checkpoint response can result in genomic instability, cell death, and a predisposition to cancer in higher organisms (3Cahill D.P. Lengauer C. Yu J. Riggins G.J. Willson J.K. Markowitz S.D. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nature. 1998; 392: 300-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (1322) Google Scholar). The tumor suppressors p53 and Atm and the product of the essential gene ATR are checkpoint genes of primary importance in mammals. The Atm protein is required for several aspects of the response to DNA damage, including cell cycle arrest and the kinetics of p53 activation (4Meyn M.S. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 5991-6001PubMed Google Scholar, 5Rotman G. Shiloh Y. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1998; 7: 1555-1563Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar).

This family includes the checkpoint proteins Mec1 and Tel1 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and rad3 from Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Protein kinase activity has been attributed to the members of the Atm family despite their homology to phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase family members (6Bentley N.J. Holtzman D.A. Flaggs G. Keegan K.S.

Chem. 1999; 274: 37538-37543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar), yet they appear to control different aspects of the response to DNA damage. The mammalian Atm family member that has been best characterized by biochemical methods is DNA-PKcs (for review, see Ref. 15Smith G.C. Jackson S.P. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 916-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (769) Google Scholar). DNA-PKcs is the catalytic subunit of a protein complex that plays a role in double strand break repair. DNA-PK is activated by single-stranded DNA (16Brush G.S. Anderson C.W. Kelly T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12520-12524Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) and double strand breaks (17Jackson S.P. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1996; 6: 19-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Although the catalytic subunit has been shown to bind DNA on its own, the heterodimeric protein complex Ku70·Ku80 acts as the DNA binding partner of DNA-PKcs. Thus, the DNA-PK complex is composed of DNA-PKcs and Ku70·Ku80 (15Smith G.C. Jackson S.P. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 916-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (769) Google Scholar). DNA-PKcs-deficient mice display abnormalities in V(D)J recombination, a process that is essential for the rearrangement of genes to generate functional immunoglobulin and T-cell receptor genes (15Smith G.C. Jackson S.P. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 916-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (769) Google Scholar). Thus, DNA-PKcs-deficient animals display severe immune deficiencies, and DNA-PK(–/–) cells display increased sensitivity to ionizing radiation and double strand break repair defects. This is despite the fact that these cells are proficient in cell cycle arrest following DNA damage and in the up-regulation of DNA damage-inducible genes (reviewed in Ref. 15Smith G.C. Jackson S.P. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 916-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (769) Google Scholar). These findings suggested that either DNA-PKcs has a redundant role with Atm and Atr in the checkpoint response or the role of DNA-PKcs is specific for repair of the DNA lesions. Chk1 (checkpoint kinase 1) was first identified in S. pombe because of its essential role for checkpoint arrest at G2/M (18al-Khodairy F. Fotou E. Sheldrick K.S. Griffiths D.J. Lehmann A.R. Carr A.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 147-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar, 19Walworth N. Davey S. Beach D. Nature. 1993; 363: 368-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). In S. pombe and S. cerevisiae, the Chk1 proteins function downstream of the Atm-like proteins to regulate the checkpoint response that prevents chromosome segregation after DNA damage. In mammalian cells and S. pombe, Chk1 blocks mitotic progression via inactivation of the mitotic inducer Cdc25 (20Sanchez Y. Wong C. Thoma R.S. Richman R. Wu Z. Piwnica-Worms H. Elledge S.J. Science. 1997; 277: 1497-1501Crossref PubMed Scopus (1126) Google Scholar, 21Peng C.Y. Graves P.R. Thoma R.S. Wu Z. Shaw A.S. Piwnica-Worms H.

A primary integrator of checkpoint and stress signals is the product of the tumor suppressor gene p53. p53 regulates many aspects of the DNA damage response, including cell cycle arrest, the transcriptional response, and apoptosis (reviewed in Ref. 23Lakin N.D. Jackson S.P. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7644-7655Crossref PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar). Therefore, p53 function is highly regulated by different forms of post-translational modifications that include phosphorylation on multiple regulatory residues (23Lakin N.D. Jackson S.P. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7644-7655Crossref PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar). Atm, Atr, and DNA-PK phosphorylate p53 on serine residues (Ser-15 by Atm, Atr, and DNA-PK and Ser-37 by DNA-PK and Atr) that have been shown to be phosphorylated in vivo following DNA damage (8Canman C.E.

Biol. 1992; 12: 5041-5049Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of Ser-15 and -37 may be important for modulating the stability and activity of p53 (10Shieh S.Y. Ikeda M. Taya Y. Prives C. Cell. 1997; 91: 325-334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1760) Google Scholar). It has also been shown that Ser-20 plays an important role in the stabilization of p53 following DNA damage (25Unger T. Juven-Gershon T. Moallem E. Berger M. Vogt Sionov R. Lozano G. Oren M. Haupt Y. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1805-1814Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar, 26Shieh S.Y. Taya Y. Prives C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1815-1823Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 27Chehab N.H.

Recently it was shown that the checkpoint kinases Chk1 and Chk2 (hCds1) phosphorylate p53 on Ser-20 (28Chehab N.H. Malikzay A. Appel M. Halazonetis T.D. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 278-288Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Hirao A. Kong Y.Y. Matsuoka S. Wakeham A. Ruland J. Yoshida H. Liu D. Elledge S.J. Mak T.W.

In this study, we investigated 1) the regulatory interaction between Chk1 and the members of the Atm family of kinases and 2) the functional role of the C-terminal non-catalytic domains of Chk1. We show that Chk1 was found in complexes that bind single-stranded DNA and double strand breaks and stimulated the kinase activity of DNA-PK complexes in vitro. Stimulation of DNA-PK resulted in enhanced phosphorylation of p53 on Ser-15 and -37 and required the C-terminal domains of Chk1. Chk1 stimulated DNA end joining in vitro, and Chk1 mutants lacking the C-terminal 115 amino acids acted in a dominant fashion to block DNA-PK kinase activity and DNA repair. Cell Culture, Treatment of Cells, and Transfection—HeLa and 293T cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. SF9 cells were grown in Insect Xpress (Biowhittaker) supplemented with 2.5% fetal bovine serum, and Hi5 cells were grown in Excell 405 (JRH Biosciences, Inc.). Cells were treated with 5 mm hydroxyurea (HU) for 24 h, unless otherwise stated. HeLa and 293T cells were transfected using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science) and LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen), respectively, following the manufacturers' instructions. Cloning, Mutagenesis, DNA, and Protein Purification—The GFP·Chk1 and GFP·Chk1KD plasmids were generated by excising Chk1 and Chk1KD cDNAs from PYS43 and PYS64, respectively, with KpnI and XmaI and ligating them to KpnI- and BspEI-cut pEYFB vector (Clontech). The GST·Chk1 C-terminal deletion mutants were generated by excising a BamHI fragment from pYS43 and pYS65 (20Sanchez Y. Wong C. Thoma R.S. Richman R. Wu Z. Piwnica-Worms H. Elledge S.J. Science. 1997; 277: 1497-1501Crossref PubMed Scopus (1126) Google Scholar) and from the EYFP·Chk1 constructs. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene) following the manufacturer's instructions. GST fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli (BL21). Soluble proteins were concentrated using glutathione-agarose beads, or the fusion proteins were expressed in Hi5 cells and collected as previously described (20Sanchez Y. Wong C. Thoma R.S. Richman R. Wu Z. Piwnica-Worms H. Elledge S.J. Science. 1997; 277: 1497-1501Crossref PubMed Scopus (1126) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation, Kinase Assays, and Pull-downs—Immunoprecipitation/kinase assays were performed as described (8Canman C.E. Lim D.S. Cimprich K.A. Taya Y. Tamai K. Sakaguchi K. Appella E. Kastan M.B. Siliciano J.D. Science. 1998; 281: 1677-1679Crossref PubMed Scopus (1712) Google Scholar). Cells were lysed in TGN buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mm β-glycerophosphate, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Tween, 1 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm DTT, 1× protein inhibitor mixture (20Sanchez Y.

Immunoprecipitation was performed in TGN buffer without glycerol. Kinase assays were performed in kinase buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 50 mm β-glycerophosphate, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm MnCl2, 5 μm ATP, and 1 mm DTT. GST pull-downs were conducted as described previously (20Sanchez Y. Wong C. Thoma R.S. Richman R. Wu Z. Piwnica-Worms H. Elledge S.J. Science. 1997; 277: 1497-1501Crossref PubMed Scopus (1126) Google Scholar). In Vitro Kinase Assays—Twenty units of DNA-PK (Promega) were preincubated with either Chk1 or Chk1KD (40–80 pmol) in kinase buffer (see above) containing 200 ng of sonicated calf thymus DNA, 15 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, 200 μm ATP, 1.3 mm spermidine, and 1 mm DTT. The preincubation step was carried out at 30 °C for 15 min. The reactions were placed on ice, and GST·p53 substrate was added. The reactions were then incubated at 30 °C for 30 min. Kinase reactions were terminated by the addition of SDS-sample buffer with 50 mm DTT as a final concentration and boiled. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE on 4–12% acrylamide gels. Where indicated, the GST·Chk1 proteins were pretreated with 10 units of DNase I prior to being used in the kinase reaction. Western Blotting, Data Quantification, and Analysis—Western blot analysis was performed as previously described (20Sanchez Y. Wong C. Thoma R.S. Richman R. Wu Z. Piwnica-Worms H. Elledge S.J. Science. 1997; 277: 1497-1501Crossref PubMed Scopus (1126) Google Scholar). Chk1 was detected with antibodies generated against a C-terminal peptide of Chk1 (anti-PEP antibodies; Ref. 20Sanchez Y. Wong C. Thoma R.S. Richman R. Wu Z. Piwnica-Worms H. Elledge S.J. Science. 1997; 277: 1497-1501Crossref PubMed Scopus (1126) Google Scholar). p53 was detected with DO-1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Phosphorylated Ser-15 and -20 on p53 were detected with phospho-specific antibodies (New England Biolabs). 32P-labeledproteins were visualized by autoradiography, and their relative densities were quantified using phosphorimaging (Molecular Dynamics) and ImageQuant. The enhanced chemiluminescence signals were quantified from exposures in the linear range using NIH image 1.6. DNA Binding and Immunoprecipitation Assays—Nuclear extracts and DNA cellulose binding assays were carried out as previously described (31Muller C. Calsou P. Frit P. Cayrol C. Carter T. Salles B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1382-1389Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) except that the nuclear extracts were dialyzed against buffer Z (31Muller C. Calsou P. Frit P. Cayrol C. Carter T. Salles B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1382-1389Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) containing 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm DTT, and 1× protein inhibitor mixture (20Sanchez Y.

Science. 1997; 277: 1497-1501Crossref PubMed Scopus (1126) Google Scholar). 12 μg of nuclear extract were incubated with DNA cellulose for 15 min at 30 °C in complete kinase buffer in a 50-μl volume. After preincubation, p53 was added and incubated an additional 30 min. For the DNA end binding assays, 50 pmol of each 78-mer oligonucleotide (one oligonucleotide was biotinylated) were annealed and incubated with 25 μl of streptavidin magnetic beads according to the manufacturer's instructions (Dynal). The DNA end binding assay was carried out by incubating 30–80 μg of nuclear extract with either annealed oligos bound to magnetic beads or magnetic beads alone as control and incubated at room temperature for 45 min-1 h in kinase buffer. ATP was added to the reaction buffer (20 μm) where indicated. The beads were washed eight times with kinase buffer and the proteins separated on 4–12% gradient gels (Invitrogen) and processed for Western analyses as above. The immunoprecipitation assays were carried out with 1 mg/ml nuclear extract in buffer Z containing 20 micromolar ATP and protease inhibitors as above. The extracts were precleared with protein A-Sepharose beads and incubated with 2 μg of antibody at 4 °C overnight. The proteins were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using the following antibodies: Chk1 anti-PEP antibody (20Sanchez Y. Wong C. Thoma R.S. Richman R. Wu Z. Piwnica-Worms H. Elledge S.J.

Immunoprecipitation of FLAG·Chk1 from 293T cells was carried out by first enriching for chromatin-associated proteins. 293T cells transfected with either CMV-FLAG·Chk1 or pCDNA3.1 were treated or not with 5 mm HU for 18 h, collected and washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and resuspended in solution A (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.34 m sucrose, 10% glycerol, 1 mm DTT, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, protease inhibitors). Cytoplasmic proteins were separated from nuclei by low-speed centrifugation (4,800 rpm for 4 min at 4 °C using the St-Micro rotor, Sorvall Super T21). Isolated nuclei were washed with solution A, resuspended in solution A containing 1 mm CaCl2 and 150 units of micrococcal nuclease (Sigma), and incubated at 4° for 1 h before stopping by adding EGTA 1 mm as final concentration. Sodium chloride was added to 300 mm final concentration and incubated for 10 min on ice. The nuclear preparation was then sonicated twice for 15 s and cleared by centrifugation at 13,200 rpm (same rotor as above) for 15 min at 4 °C. The extracts were diluted in Buffer Z and precleared with Protein A-Sepharose followed by incubation with FLAG-affinity resin at 4 °C overnight. The proteins were precipitated by gentle centrifugation, washed extensively, and separated on a 4–12% gradient SDS-PAGE gels. DNA Repair Assays—Extracts were prepared and used for end-joining assays as previously described (32Baumann P. West S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14066-14070Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. 10 ng of pDEA-7Z digested with BsaI were incubated with 15 μg of total cell extract in a 10-μl volume for 90 min at 37 °C. GST and GST·Chk1Δ proteins were added at approximately equal concentrations at the beginning of the reaction. The reactions were treated with 10 μg of Proteinase K for 30 min at 37 °C followed by phenol chloroform extraction. The deproteinated DNA products were separated on 0.7% agarose gels containing 1 μg/ml ethidium bromide, transferred to nitrocellulose, hybridized with a 32P-labeled RsaI fragment from pDEA-7Z, and visualized by autoradiography. DNA-PK and Chk1 Display a Synergistic Interaction in the Phosphorylation of p53 on Ser-15 and Ser-37—Chk1 proteins from S. pombe and S. cerevisiae function downstream of the Atm homologues rad3 and Mec1 to regulate mitotic progression following DNA damage (20Sanchez Y.

Chk1 and DNA-PK phosphorylate p53 on Ser-15 and -37 (30Shieh S.Y. Ahn J. Tamai K. Taya Y. Prives C. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 289-300Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the phosphorylation of these residues is increased following DNA damage. To determine whether the Atm-related kinases regulate Chk1, we performed experiments to test whether purified DNA-PK complexes (DNA-PKcs + Ku70 and Ku80) would increase p53 phosphorylation by Chk1 in vitro. We found that preincubation of DNA-PK and Chk1 in the presence of sheared DNA led to a 13–55-fold increase in p53 phosphorylation (with an average induction of 35-fold) (Fig. 1a). The increased p53 phosphorylation was dependent both on Chk1 concentration and the presence of sheared (activated) DNA and was not observed when DNA-PK was preincubated with GST alone. 2D. M. Goudelock and Y. Sanchez, unpublished data. To rule out the possibility that the enhancement seen in our assay was because of contaminating DNA in the Chk1 preparations, kinase assays were carried out with increasing concentrations of Chk1 with and without the addition of sheared DNA. We observed that the dramatic enhanced phosphorylation of p53 increased with Chk1 concentration only in reactions where sheared DNA had been added to the reaction (Fig. 1b , top). To further rule out the possibility that the Chk1 preparation contained some form of DNA that would activate DNA-PK, we performed the kinase assays with Chk1 protein preparations that had been pretreated with DNase I. Treatment with DNase I did not reduce the ability of Chk1 to synergize with the DNA-PK complex (Fig. 1b , bottom). These experiments indicated that the synergism observed in our assays was not because of contaminating DNA in the Chk1 protein preparations (Fig. 1b). We used phosphorylation-defective p53 mutated proteins and anti-phospho-specific antibodies to determine the residues phosphorylated by DNA-PK and Chk1. Mutation at Ser-37, a site known to be phosphorylated by both DNA-PK and Chk1, resulted in considerable loss of the enhanced phosphorylation of p53 mediated by DNA-PK and Chk1 (see Fig. 1, c–f). However, phosphorylation of this mutated p53 was still enhanced when both DNA-PK and Chk1 were present (Fig. 1f). These data suggest that DNA-PK and Chk1 show synergistic activity toward more than one site on p53. Phosphorylation of Ser-15 was slightly reduced in the mutated Ser-37 (Fig. 1c , lane 4), and the mutation of Ser-15 caused a mild reduction of 32P incorporation into GST·p53 (1–80). Mutations at both Ser-15 and -37 in GST·p53 (1–80) resulted in undetectable phosphorylation by the kinases whether they were present alone or together (Fig. 1e , last lane). These results indicate that DNA-PK and Chk1 act synergistically to phosphorylate p53 on serines 15 and 37, with Ser-37 being the major phospho-acceptor of the enhanced phosphorylation observed in these assays. Recently it has been shown that phosphorylation of Ser-20 and not Ser-15 regulates stability of p53 following DNA damage (27Chehab N.H. Malikzay A. Stavridi E.S. Halazonetis T.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13777-13782Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). In our assays, mutation of Ser-20 also decreased the enhanced levels of 32P incorporation and phospho-Ser-15 as measured by antibody staining. This reduction may indicate that Ser-20 is required for Ser-15 or -37 to be phosphorylated, or it may be that a change in the protein at residue 20 affects the adjacent residues and indirectly affects Ser-15 and -37 phosphorylation. To rule out that the DNA-PK protein fraction (Promega) contained other p53 kinases that could be enhanced by the recombinant Chk1, such as Atr, the proteins in the DNA-PK fraction (20-fold of the amount used in each reaction or 400 units) were analyzed by immunoblotting for the presence of DNA-PK, Atr, Atm, replication protein A (Rpa) 2, and Chk1. Although we observed a strong signal for DNA-PK and Ku80, we did not detect Atm, Atr, or Chk1 signals in the fraction used as a source of DNA-PK/Ku in our assays (Supplementary Fig. 2). 3D. M. Goudelock and Y. Sanchez, unpublished results. However, the possibility exists that other p53 kinases are present at such low levels that they are below the level of detection by the antibodies used. Atm does not phosphorylate p53 on Ser-37, which is the major phospho-acceptor residue in our enhancement assay, indicating that it is not Atm that is being activated in our assay. The C-terminal Domain of Chk1 but Not Its Catalytic Activity Is Required for the Stimulation of DNA-PK—To address the direction of signaling between Chk1 and DNA-PK, we found that addition of wortmannin (a phosphatidylinositol kinase inhibitor) during or after the preincubation step resulted in a dramatic reduction in p53 phosphorylation (data not shown), whereas wortmannin had no effect on phosphorylation of p53 by Chk1. This suggested that Chk1 was enhancing the phosphorylation of p53 by DNA-PK. To further investigate the role of Chk1 in this synergistic interaction, we tested a catalytically defective Chk1 protein (Chk1KDD130A) (20Sanchez Y. Wong C. Thoma R.S. Richman R. Wu Z. Piwnica-Worms H. Elledge S.J. Science. 1997; 277: 1497-1501Crossref PubMed Scopus (1126) Google Scholar) for its ability to act synergistically with DNA-PK. We found that Chk1KD had a comparable ability to that of wild-type Chk1 in the stimulation of p53 phosphorylation by DNA-PK (Fig. 2). This effect was observed whether we used the first 80 amino acids of p53 (Fig. 2b) or the full-length p53 protein (Fig. 2a) fused to GST as the substrate. These results indicated that the role of Chk1 is not dependent on catalytic activity and suggested that Chk1 could be exerting a conformational change on the DNA-PK complex. The Chk1 kinases from different species share conserved motifs in their C-terminal domain (Ref. 20Sanchez Y. Wong C. Thoma R.S. Richman R. Wu Z. Piwnica-Worms H. Elledge S.J. Science. 1997; 277: 1497-1501Crossref PubMed Scopus (1126) Google Scholar). The high conservation between the Chk1 kinases suggests that they may be regulated by common mechanisms and that the C-terminal tail is likely to contain regulatory domain(s). To address whether regions outside the kinase domain were required for the effect on DNA-PK activity, we generated mutants of Chk1 that lacked the C-terminal 115 amino acids in both the catalytically proficient and catalytically defective mutant of Chk1 (Fig. 2, b and c). Deletion of the C-terminal region of Chk1 abrogated the enhancement of p53 phosphorylation by DNA-PK (Fig. 2c, compare lanes 2 and 4, 3 and 5). In fact, the GST·Chk1Δ mutant, which retained some catalytic activity as measured by phosphorylation of Cdc25C, 4D. M. Goudelock and Y. Sanchez, unpublished data. inhibited the DNA-dependent phosphorylation of p53 by DNA-PK at the concentrations tested (Fig. 2c, compare lanes 1 and 4). Thus Chk1 stimulates the kinase activity of DNA-PK via its C-terminal domains. Although the role of DNA-PK in p53 phosphorylation in vivo is not clear, our data suggest that high levels of Chk1 or the catalytically inactive Chk1D130A (Chk1KD) mutant could stimulate the kinase activity of DNA-PK. Chk1 Binds DNA and Double Strand Ends and This Interaction Does Not Require the Catalytic Activity of DNA-PK— Although we did not detect binding of Chk1 purified from bacterial cells to double-stranded oligonucleotides by gel retardation assays under phosphorylation permissive conditions (see above), the regulatory interactions between DNA-PK complexes and Chk1 suggested that Chk1 may interact with these proteins in the presence of DNA. To investigate whether Chk1 may complex with proteins bound to DNA, we examined the ability of Chk1 from nuclear extracts prepared from the glioblastoma cell lines MO59J and MO69K to be precipitated using DNA cellulose beads under phosphorylation-permissive conditions.

This enzyme belongs to a family of prenyltransferases that make linear IPP condensation products with designate chain lengths (4Ogura K. Koyama T. Sagami H. Bittman R. Subcellular Biochemistry. Vol. 28. Plenum Press, New York1997: 57-88Google Scholar). These enzymes are divided into trans-type and cis-type, which catalyze the trans- and cis-double bond formation during each IPP condensation, respectively (5Ogura K. Koyama T. Chem.

Unlike trans-prenyltransferases, which tend to make short and medium chain-length products ranging from C15 to C50, UPPs and other cis-prenyltransferases mostly generate ≥C55 long-chain products. Significant sequence homology has been found within the cis- and trans-prenyltransferases, but the two groups of enzymes do not share sequence similarity (7Shimizu N. Koyama T. Ogura K. J. Biol.

Among the trans-prenyltransferases, the crystal structure of avian farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase has been solved almost a decade ago, and the mechanism has been elucidated (9Tarshis L.C. Yan M.

However, only recently have the first crystal structures of cis-prenyltransferase (UPPs) become available (10Fujihashi M. Zhang Y.-W. Higuchi Y. Li X.-Y. Koyama T. Miki K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

Previous site-directed mutagenesis studies suggested that the substrates FPP and IPP are bound on top of the tunnel, and the farnesyl moiety of FPP migrates toward its bottom during product chain elongation (14Pan J.J.

In the crystal structure of UPPs from Micrococcus luteus, a sulfate ion bound to a conserved structural P-loop represents the location of the pyrophosphate moiety of FPP (10Fujihashi M. Zhang Y.-W. Higuchi Y. Li X.-Y. Koyama T. Miki K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4337-4342Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The previous E. coli UPPs crystal was grown using polyethylene glycol (PEG), and no sulfate ion was observed (11Ko T.P. Chen Y.K. Robinson H. Tsai P.C. Gao Y.-G. Chen A.P.-C. Wang A.H.-J. Liang P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47474-47482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Metal ion was not found in both apo-UPPs structures, although the enzyme requires Mg2+ for activity. Two protein conformers of the E. coli UPPs were observed, i.e. one with a bound PEG fragment that adopts a narrower conformation than the other one with water molecules in the active site, indicating the possible open and close mechanism for substrate binding and product release. These two conformers have the most striking difference in the position of the α3 helix, which is connected to a loop containing amino acids 72–82. In the proposed catalytic model, the loop may play an essential role in pulling the α3 helix toward the active site (17Chen Y.H. Chen A.P.-C. Chen C.T. Wang A.H.-J. Liang P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7369-7376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Perhaps because of the requirement of its flexibility in enzyme catalysis, this loop was invisible in the previous crystal structure of the apoenzyme. Neither was this loop observed in the crystal structure of UPPs from M. luteus, in which both subunits had the closed conformation (10Fujihashi M. Zhang Y.-W. Higuchi Y. Li X.-Y. Koyama T. Miki K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4337-4342Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). To answer the questions regarding the location of substrate binding, the role of the metal ion, and the function of the flexible loop in enzyme catalysis, we report here the structure of UPPs with sulfates, Mg2+ ions, and two molecules of Triton X-100 occupying the tunnel in conjunction with the kinetic results of a few relevant mutants. Triton at low concentration has been shown to increase the UPPs steady-state reaction rate (18Pan J.J. Chiou S.T. Liang P.H. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 10936-10942Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). However, a high concentration of Triton in the crystallization condition resulted in the occupancy of Triton in the active site. Therefore, the dose dependence of Triton in altering the reaction velocity was also examined. Materials—Radiolabeled [14C]IPP (55 mCi/mmol) was purchased from Amersham Biosciences, and FPP was obtained from Sigma. Reversed-phase thin layer chromatography (TLC) plates were purchased from Merck. Taq DNA polymerase was obtained from Invitrogen. The plasmid mini-prep kit, DNA gel extraction kit, and a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin were purchased from Qiagen. Potato acid phosphatase (2 units/mg) was purchased from Roche Applied Science. FXa and the protein expression kit (including the pET32Xa/LIC vector and competent JM109 and BL21 cells) were obtained from Novagen. All commercial buffers and reagents were of the highest grade. Crystallographic Analysis—For purification of enzymes, our previously reported protocol of using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column was followed (18Pan J.J. Chiou S.T. Liang P.H. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 10936-10942Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The purified wild-type UPPs was crystallized using the hanging drop set-up from Hampton Research (Laguna Niguel, CA), while attempts were tried to incorporate FPP into the crystal. In the end, 2 μl of mother liquid containing 0.01 m cobalt chloride, 0.1 m MES, and 1.8 m ammonium sulfate at pH 6.5 was mixed with 2 μl of protein solution consisting of 10 mg/ml UPPs, 2% Triton X-100, 5 mm MgCl2, and 660 μm FPP. The mixture was equilibrated against 200 μl of the mother liquid at 25 °C. Crystals started to appear within 10 days. This condition was different from the previous one for the Se-Met enzyme (11Ko T.P. Chen Y.K. Robinson H. Tsai P.C. Gao Y.-G. Chen A.P.-C. Wang A.H.-J. Liang P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47474-47482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), but the crystals turned out to be isomorphous. Diffraction experiments on the UPPs crystal was carried out at –150 °C on beam line 17B2 of the National Synchrotron Radiation Research Center in Hsinchu, Taiwan. Data were processed and scaled by employing the program HKL2000 (19Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38526) Google Scholar). For computational refinement, manual modification, and analysis of the crystal structure, the programs CNS (20Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.-S.

Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19748) Google Scholar) were used. Using 2.0-Å resolution data and the apoenzyme model that we solved previously, but with all solvent and cofactor molecules removed, an initial R-value of 0.52 was calculated, and it was reduced immediately to 0.39 after rigid body refinement. The Se-Met residues in the original model were replaced with methionines, and subsequent energy minimization yielded an R-value of 0.29 before calculation of the first Fourier map. According to the density level of 1.5 σ, 327 water molecules were added to the model, and the amino acid side chains were adjusted. Strong densities in the active site tunnel of one subunit (monomer B) clearly showed two Triton molecules, but they were modeled as a series of solvent atoms. Possible densities for sulfate and metal ions were also modeled as water molecules. Prior to subsequent refinement, 5% of randomly selected reflections were set aside to calculate R free values for monitoring progress of refinement (23Brunger A.T. Nature. 1992; 355: 472-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (3860) Google Scholar). The model yielded R and R free values of 0.227 and 0.256 after simulated annealing and temperature factor refinement when the resolution was increased to 1.8 Å. Explicit models for the two Triton molecules, the sulfate, and the magnesium ions were constructed, and the polypeptide termini were also modified according to the Fourier maps. With the bound cofactors and 393 water molecules, the R and R free values were reduced to 0.200 and 0.231, respectively. At this point, densities for residues 72–82 of monomer B became interpretable in the map, and the corresponding fragment was modeled. Finally, the resolution was increased to 1.73 Å, and more water molecules were added according to 1.0 σ density level in the 2F o – F c map.

Open table in a new tab Site-directed Mutagenesis of UPPs—UPPs mutants were prepared by using PCR techniques in conjunction with the E. coli Bos-12 UPPs gene template in the pET32Xa/Lic vector. The mutagenic primers used were prepared by MdBio, Inc. The mutagenic oligonucleotides for performing site-directed mutagenesis are as follows: 5′-GCCTTTGGGGCTAAAGCC-3′ for H43A; 5′-GGGGAGGCTCGCATTAGT-3′ for H199A; and 5′-GGGGAGGCTCGCATTAGT-3′ and 5′-GCCTATGCCGCACTTTAC-3′ for the H199A/E213A double mutant. Subsequently, the forward primer 5′-GGTATTGAGGGTCGCATGTTGTCTGCT-3′ and the reverse primer 5′-AGAGGAGAGTTAGAGCCATCAGGCTGT-3′ were used in combination with the PCR products obtained using the above mutagenic oligonucleotides to create the full-length mutant UPPs genes. The FXa cleavage site (IEGR) and the complementary sequences to the sticky ends of the linear vector pET-32Xa/LIC were included in these primers. Thirty cycles of PCR were performed using a thermocycler (Applied Biosystems) with the melting temperature at 95 °C for 2 min, annealing temperature at 42 °C for 2 min, and polymerization temperature at 68 °C for 40 s. The PCR product was subjected to electrophoresis on 0.8% agarose gel in Tris-acetate-EDTA (TAE) buffer, and the gel was then stained with ethidium bromide. The part of the gel containing the band of the correct size was excised, and the DNA was recovered using a DNA elution kit. The constructed gene of a mutant enzyme was ligated to the vector by incubation for 1 h at 22 °C. The recombinant UPPs plasmid was then used to transform E. coli JM109 competent cells that were streaked on a Luria-Bertani (LB) agar plate containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin. Ampicillin-resistant colonies were selected from the agar plate and grown in 5 ml of LB culture containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin overnight at 37 °C. The mutation was confirmed by sequencing the entire UPPs mutant gene of the plasmid obtained from the overnight culture. The correct construct was subsequently transformed to E. coli BL21 for protein expression. The 5-ml overnight culture of a single transformant was used to inoculate 500 ml of fresh LB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin. The cells were grown to A 600 = 0.6 and induced with 1 mm isopropyl-β-thiogalactopyranoside. After 4–5 h, the cells were harvested by centrifugation at 7,000 × g for 15 min. Measurements of K m and k cat Values for Mutant UPPs—For the measurements of kinetic parameters, mutant UPPs (0.01 μm H199A, 0.5 μm H199A/E213A, or 0.5 μm H43A) was utilized to initiate the reaction of FPP and [14C]IPP in 200-μl solutions. For IPP K m and k cat determinations, 5 μm FPP was utilized to saturate the enzyme, and IPP concentrations of 0.5–5-fold K m were employed. For FPP K m measurements, 0.2–20 μm FPP were used along with 20 μm [14C]IPP. All reactions were carried out in 100 mm KOH-Hepes buffer, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, and 0.5 mm MgCl2 at 25 °C in the presence of 0.1% Triton X-100. To measure the initial rate, 40-μl portions of the reaction mixture were periodically withdrawn within 10% substrate depletion and mixed with 10 mm EDTA for reaction termination. The radiolabeled products were then extracted with 1-butanol, and the radioactivities associated with aqueous and butanol phases were separately quantitated by using a Beckman LS6500 scintillation counter. Initial velocity data were fitted to Equation 1 to obtain K m and k cat values by non-linear regression using KaleidaGraph computer program. The k cat was calculated from V max/[E], as shown in Equation 1, v0=Vmax[S]/(Km+[S])(Eq. 1) where v 0 is the initial velocity, [E] is the enzyme concentration, [S] is the substrate concentration, V max is the maximum velocity; and K m is the Michaelis constant. Enzyme Activity Measurement under Different Concentrations of Triton X-100 —To measure the kinetic constant of E. coli UPPs in the presence of Triton X-100, the enzyme reaction was initiated by adding 0.1 μm UPPs to a reaction mixture containing 0.001% Triton X-100, whereas to reaction mixtures containing 0.01, 0.05, 0.07, 0.1, 0.5, or 1.5% of Triton X-100 (v/v), 0.01 μm enzyme was added. All reactions were carried out in 5 μm FPP and 50 μm [14C]IPP along with 100 mm Hepes-KOH buffer (pH 7.5), 50 mm KCl, and 0.5 mm MgCl2. Portions of the reaction mixture were periodically withdrawn within 10% substrate depletion and mixed with 10 mm EDTA for reaction termination. The radiolabeled products were then extracted with 1-butanol, and the radioactivities associated with aqueous and organic phases were separately quantitated by using a Beckman LS6500 scintillation counter. Under the saturated concentration of FPP and IPP (>5-fold K m value), the rate of IPP condensation was determined as k cat (s–1). Overall Structure—The refined model of UPPs in complex with sulfate, Mg2+, and Triton contains amino acid residues 13–71 and 86–240 in one subunit (monomer A) and 17–241 in another (monomer B). Fig. 1, A and B show ribbon diagrams of the dimeric protein structure. There are two sulfate ions in the active site of each monomer and two Triton X-100 molecules bound to the active site tunnel of monomer B. Two magnesium ions are bound to equivalent positions at the dimer interface. Not included in this figures are a fifth sulfate ion and an unidentified compound with a five-member ring, both observed at crystal contact regions, plus 688 water molecules. The two UPPs subunits have very similar structures as those observed in the apoenzyme crystal (11Ko T.P. Chen Y.K. Robinson H. Tsai P.C. Gao Y.-G. Chen A.P.-C. Wang A.H.-J. Liang P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47474-47482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), with monomers A and B assuming the closed and open conformations, respectively. The entire dimers of UPPs can be superimposed with a root mean square deviation of 1.59 Å between bound and apo forms for all 3,383 equivalent non-hydrogen atoms. Excluding the terminal residues that have large deviations, the root mean square deviation is 1.18 Å for 3,300 atoms and 0.594 Å if only 1,656 backbone atoms are compared. The most significant difference in the protein model of apo-UPPs and the current UPPs model is the presence of the additional loop 72–82 in monomer B, as shown in Fig. 1C. In the final difference Fourier map, although some of the side chains still lack clear densities, the polypeptide backbone is well defined. The loop was not in contact with neighboring molecules, and it became visible probably because the bound Triton molecules stabilized this particular conformation of UPPs in the crystal. The residues of 79–82 extended the helix α3 by more than one turn at the N terminus, which is capped with Pro-78. The succeeding residue, Ser-83, was moved by more than 2 Å away from the active site. Indeed, the entire α3 helix was displaced by ∼1–2 Å before the kink at Glu-96 and ∼1 Å for residues 97–103. It became more straightened than in the original model. The adjacent helix α4 was also shifted by about 1 Å. Thus, the structure of monomer B in the present UPPs crystal has an even more open conformation than that of apo-UPPs. In contrast, monomer A remained largely unchanged as in the apo-UPPs crystal. Only slight shifts were observed in the helices α3 and α4, with maximal displacements of 1 Å, although the kink of helix α3 seems to occur at Glu-96 also rather than at Ala-92, as in apo-UPPs. Apparently, monomer A assumes a closed conformation, as in the apoenzyme. The B-values of residues 88–96 are between 40 and 60 Å2, whereas those of 86–87 are over 60 Å2, indicating some disorder in this region. Other regions with B-values higher than 40 Å2 are located in residues 114–115 of monomer A and 74–81 of monomer B, corresponding to the loops of βC-α4 and βB-α3, respectively. Movement of these two helices, which constitute the forewing in the butterfly-shaped UPPs molecule (11Ko T.P. Chen Y.K. Robinson H. Tsai P.C. Gao Y.-G. Chen A.P.-C. Wang A.H.-J. Liang P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47474-47482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), accounts for the conversion between open and closed conformations and, thus, modulates binding and release of the substrate and product from the tunnel-shaped active site. Adjacent to the flexible loop, residues 69–71 at the C terminus of strand βB show maximal displacements (Fig. 1C). Specifically, the entire residues of Ala-69, Phe-70, and Ser-71 in monomer B were moved by 3.3, 5.8, and 7.5 Å, respectively. The phenyl group of Phe-70 was moved by 14.0 Å from the original position in apo-UPPs, where it was only <2 Å away from a bound sulfate ion in the current structure. Such structural changes presumably were a result of the bound sulfate ion and Triton molecules in the active site. It now interacts directly with the tert-octyl phenyl head group of Triton (see below). The neighboring side chains of Leu-85, Leu-88, Phe-89, Trp-91, and Ser-95 in the α3 helix were also rotated to accommodate the Triton molecule. Similar rearrangements for residues 69–71 were also observed in monomer A, but the side chains in helix α3 remained in their original positions, perhaps because of the absence of the Triton molecule. The N-terminal part of helix α3 that encompasses residues 79–85 and the connecting loop of 72–78 to strand βB were not observed in monomer A. Presumably, these residues were flexible, as in the apoenzyme. The Sulfate Ions—Both FPP and IPP substrates, as well as the reaction intermediates and the final product UPP, have a highly negatively charged pyrophosphate moiety in the molecule. In the previously solved crystal structure of farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase, the allylic and homoallylic substrates are bound via Mg2+ions, which are coordinated with the active site Asp residues in the conserved DDXXD motifs (9Tarshis L.C. Yan M. Poulter C.D. Sacchettini J.C. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10871-10877Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). However, a similar DDXXD motif was not found in cis-prenyltransferases. In contrast, the crystal structure of UPPs from M. luteus (10Fujihashi M. Zhang Y.-W. Higuchi Y. Li X.-Y. Koyama T. Miki K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4337-4342Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) showed a sulfate ion bound to a highly conserved structural P-loop that contains the positively charged Arg-32 (equivalent to Arg-30 in the E. coli enzyme). This structural P-loop is supposed to interact with the pyrophosphate of the allylic substrate FPP. A second binding site for pyrophosphate of the homoallylic substrate IPP was also proposed (10Fujihashi M. Zhang Y.-W. Higuchi Y. Li X.-Y. Koyama T. Miki K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4337-4342Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 16Kharel Y. Zhang Y.-W. Fujihashi M. Miki K. Koyama T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28459-28464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). It involves two positively charged arginine residues, 197 and 203 (Arg-194 and Arg-200 in E. coli). In both cases, Mg2+ ions were also supposed to participate in substrate binding by bridging the pyrophosphates of FPP and IPP with the acidic side chains of Asp-29 and Glu-216* (Asp26 and Glu213* in E. coli). 2Residues in the counter subunit are designated by an asterisk after the position number (e.g. Glu-216*). In our refined UPPs structure there are five sulfate ions, and both monomers have two sulfates bound in the active site, as shown in Figs. 1 and 2. The first sulfate ion (S1) forms five well defined hydrogen bonds with the backbone nitrogen atoms of Gly-27, Gly-29, and Arg-30 and the side-chain NE and NH2 atoms of Arg-30. The side chain of the less conserved Arg-39 is 2.8 Å from the S1 sulfate in monomer A, but the distance is 4.0 Å in monomer B. Nevertheless, this Arg-39 as well as the Arg-77 in the flexible loop may both participate in substrate binding and charge neutralization in case of a more negative pyrophosphate. The second sulfate ion (S2) forms four hydrogen bonds with the side-chain nitrogen atoms NH2 of Arg-194, NE and NH2 of Arg-200, and the oxygen OG1 of Ser-202, which is hydrogen bonded to NH1 of Arg-194. One of the S2 oxygen atoms in monomer A is 2.7 Å from the backbone N of the C-terminal Arg-242*, indicating a fifth hydrogen bond. The side chain of Arg-241* is 3.4 Å from the S2 ion. Again, these two arginines and the nearby Arg-239* may interact with the pyrophosphate group of the substrate, although none of them is strictly conserved. A fifth sulfate ion was observed on the outer surface of monomer B (see Fig. 1C). It is bound directly to the side chain of Arg-102, forming two well defined hydrogen bonds with the NH1 and NH2 atoms. Two additional water-mediated hydrogen bonds were also observed between this sulfate and the backbone oxygen atom of Ser-95. It may also interact with the nearby side chains of Lys-98 and a symmetry-related Lys-33, but no direct bonds were seen. One of the two mediating water molecules was also hydrogen-bonded to the backbone nitrogen atom of Ser-99 and a third water molecule, which was bound to the backbone oxygen and nitrogen atoms of"

Moreover, severe CAA leads to loss of vessel wall integrity and cerebral hemorrhage. Although the basis for these latter pathological consequences in CAA remains unresolved alterations in local proteolytic mechanisms may be involved. Here we show that pathogenic forms of Aβ stimulate the expression of plasminogen activator activity in cultured human cerebrovascular smooth muscle (HCSM) cells, an in vitro model of CAA. RNase protection assays and plasminogen zymography showed that urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) was responsible for this activity. There was preferential accumulation of uPA on the HCSM cell surface that was mediated through a concomitant increase in expression of the uPA receptor. In the presence of plasminogen there was robust degradation of Aβ that was added to the HCSM cells resulting in restoration of cell viability. This suggests that increased expression of uPA may initially serve as a protective mechanism leading to localized degradation and clearance of the pathogenic stimulus Aβ. On the other hand, chronic expression of uPA and plasminogen activation led to a profound loss of HCSM cell attachment. This suggests that a similar prolonged effect in vivo in the cerebral vessel wall may contribute to loss of integrity and cerebral hemorrhage in CAA.

Aβ is a 39–43-amino acid peptide that has the propensity to self-assemble into insoluble, β-sheet-containing fibrils (1Selkoe D.J. Physiol.

In this regard, full-length AβPP is proteolytically processed by an enzyme, termed β-secretase, at the amino terminus of the Aβ domain.

Subsequent cleavage of the remaining amyloidogenic membrane-spanning AβPP carboxyl-terminal fragment by an enzyme termed γ-secretase liberates the 40- or 42-amino acid residue Aβ peptide.

Alternatively, full-length AβPP can be proteolytically processed by an enzyme termed α-secretase through the Aβ domain. This cleavage event generates a non-amyloidogenic membrane-spanning carboxyl-terminal fragment and truncated secretory forms of AβPPα (sAβPPα) that are released into the extracellular environment (14Esch F.S.

Cerebrovascular Aβ deposition, known as cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), is accompanied by smooth muscle cell degeneration suggesting a toxic effect of Aβ to these cells in vivo (16Coria F.

Similar to these in vivo observations, we have reported that Aβ42, the more pathogenic form of the wild-type peptide, causes cellular degeneration accompanied by a marked increase in the level of cell-associated AβPP in cultured human cerebrovascular smooth muscle (HCSM) cells, an in vitro model of CAA (20Davis-Salinas J.

In more recent studies we demonstrated that mutations within Aβ that are associated with familial forms of CAA (E22Q Dutch, E22K Italian, and D23N Iowa) markedly enhance both the fibrillogenic and cerebrovascular pathogenic properties of Aβ toward cultured HCSM cells (23Davis J.

These investigations showed that CAA mutant forms of Aβ assemble into an extensive network of fibril-like structures on the surfaces of HCSM cells. Furthermore, fibril assembly of pathogenic Aβ on the cell surface is required for inducing downstream pathologic responses in HCSM cells, including cell surface accumulation of sAβPPα, degradation of vascular smooth muscle cell α actin, and ultimately an apoptotic cell death (24Van Nostrand W.E.

Urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) and tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) are serine proteinases that mediate the conversion of the proenzyme plasminogen into the active enzyme plasmin. Both tPA and uPA function locally as plasminogen activators because of their interactions with specific proteins that restrict their activities. For example, tPA is normally localized to fibrin deposits because of a direct tight binding interaction, where it mediates plasminogen activation for dissolution of the fibrin clot. It is noteworthy that fibrillar Aβ can substitute for fibrin in binding and stimulating tPA-mediated plasminogen activation (28Kingston I.B. Castro M.J. Anderson S. Nat. Med. 1995; 1: 138-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 29Van Nostrand W.E. Porter M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11570-11576Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 30Tucker H.M. Kihiko M. Caldwell J.N. Wright S. Price D. Scheff S. McGillis J.P. Rydel R.E. Estus S. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 3937-3946Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, the activity of uPA appears to be localized to cell surfaces via its binding to the uPA receptor (uPAR), a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored protein (31Vassalli J.D. Sappino A.P. Belin D. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 88: 1067-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (1098) Google Scholar). The binding of uPA to uPAR also enhances its activity generating high local levels of plasmin at cell surfaces. This has implied an important role for uPA in the induction of proteolytic events at the cell surface such as extracellular matrix protein degradation and activation of latent proteinases such as matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). Components of the uPA/plasmin system are expressed in brain-derived neurons, astrocytes, and microglia in vitro (30Tucker H.M. Kihiko M. Caldwell J.N. Wright S. Price D. Scheff S. McGillis J.P.

Similarly, expression of uPA, its receptor uPAR, and plasminogen have been reported in these cell types in brain, as well as in the cerebral vessel wall in vivo (30Tucker H.M. Kihiko M. Caldwell J.N.

The uPA/plasmin system has been implicated in several pathophysiological processes including thrombosis, atherosclerosis, and vessel rupture (36Blasi F. BioEssays. 1993; 15: 105-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar, 37Keski-Oja J. Lohi J. Tuuttila A. Tryggvason K. Vartio T. Exp. Cell Res. 1992; 202: 471-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). There is a growing body of evidence linking the activities of the uPA/plasmin system and MMP functions in vascular alterations. Although the uPA/plasmin system can degrade some extracellular matrix components directly it is likely more effective in activating pro-MMPs. For example, it was reported that uPA can directly activate pro-MMP-2 (38Okada Y. Gonoji Y. Naka K. Tomita K. Nakanishi I. Iwata K. Yamashita K. Hayakawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21712-21719Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmin can directly activate pro-MMP-9 and an intermediate form of MMP-2 (39Andreasen P.A. Egelund R. Petersen H.H. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2000; 57: 25-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (838) Google Scholar). In addition, there are several lines of in vivo evidence to further support the interaction between uPA/plasmin and MMPs in vascular pathological conditions. For instance, increased expression of uPA and MMPs has been found in atherosclerotic plaques and associated smooth muscle cells (40Sakalihasan N. Delvenne P. Nusgens B.V. Limet R. Lapiere C.M. J. Vasc. Surg. 1996; 24: 127-133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, 41Schneiderman J. Bordin G.M. Engelberg I. Adar R. Seiffert D. Thinnes T. Bernstein E.F. Dilley R.B.

Smooth muscle cell destruction and vessel wall rupture were reduced in a mouse atherosclerosis model developed on a uPA knockout background suggesting that uPA may contribute to these pathologic events (42Carmeliet P. Moons L. Lijnen H.R. Baes M. Lemaitre V. Tipping P. Drew A. Eeckhout Y. Shapiro S. Lupu F. Collen D. Nat. Genet. 1997; 17: 439-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). Similarly, uPA-deficient mice were protected from cardiac rupture in a mouse model of acute myocardial infarction (43Heymans S. Lutton A. Nuyens D. Theilmeier G. Creemers E. Moons L. Dyspersin G.D. Cleutjens J.P.M. Shipley M. Angellillo A. Levi M. Nube O. Baker A. Keshet E. Lupu F. Herbert J.-M. Smiths F.J.M. Shapiro S.D. Baes M. Borgers M. Collen D. Daemen M.J.A.P. Carmliet P. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 1135-1142Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar). Despite the number of studies investigating the uPA/plasmin system in vascular alterations and vessel rupture in the periphery there have been no investigation into its potential role in loss of vessel wall integrity and cerebral hemorrhage in CAA. Here we show that pathogenic Aβ deposition causes a robust increase in the expression and cell surface localization of uPA in cultured HCSM cells. The present results suggest that enhanced uPA expression and subsequent plasminogen activation may initially be a protective response by HCSM cells to promote localized degradation of Aβ, the pathogenic stimulus, and inhibit the progression of CAA. However, prolonged activation of plasminogen may have its own deleterious effects and contribute to loss of vessel wall integrity and hemorrhage in CAA. Materials—Wild-type and Dutch mutant Aβ peptides were synthesized by solid-phase Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) amino acid chemistry, purified by reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography, and structurally characterized as described previously (44Burdick D. Soreghan B. Kwon M. Kosmoski J. Knauer M. Henschen A. Cotman C.W. Glabe C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 546-554Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For preparation of amyloid fibrils, Aβ was resuspended to a final concentration of 1.25 mm in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4, and incubated at 37 °C for 3 days. Circular dichroism spectroscopy and electron microscopy confirmed the β-sheet, fibrillar structure of Aβ as described previously (24Van Nostrand W.E. Melchor J. Ruffini L. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 216-223Google Scholar). For cell culture experiments lyophilized Aβ peptide was first resuspended to a concentration of 250 μm in sterile distilled water. Prior to addition to HCSM cells, the unassembled peptide was diluted to a final concentration of 25 μm in serum-free culture medium. Purified uPA, tPA, and Glu-plasminogen were obtained from Calbiochem. Tosyl-Gly-Pro-Lys-p-nitroanilide (Chromozym-PL) was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Secondary peroxidase-coupled sheep anti-mouse IgG and peroxidase-coupled donkey anti-rabbit IgG were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Supersignal Dura West chemiluminescence substrate was purchased from Pierce. HCSM Cell Culture—Primary cultures of HCSM cells were established as described previously (45Van Nostrand W.E. Rozemuller A.J.M. Chung R. Cotman C.W. Saporito-Irwin S.M. Amyloid. 1994; 1: 1-7Crossref Scopus (52) Google Scholar) and shown to robustly express vascular smooth muscle cell α actin, vascular smooth muscle myosin, and SM22α. Two lines of HCSM cells were used in these studies. One was derived from a 70-year-old male Alzheimer's disease patient, and the other was derived from a 37-year-old female control. All HCSM cells were used between passages 4 and 7 and maintained in 24-well tissue culture dishes with Dulbecco's minimum essential medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Gemini Bio-Products, Calabasas, CA), non-essential amino acids, and antibiotics (Invitrogen). For experiments, near confluent cultures of HCSM cells were placed in serum-free medium containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin, non-essential amino acids, and antibiotics overnight prior to treatment. Freshly solubilized monomeric wild-type or Dutch mutant Aβ40, at a final concentration of 25 μm, was added to the cultures in serum-free medium and incubated at 37 °C for up to 6 days. Cells were viewed and photographed using an Olympus IX70 phase-contrast microscope. Cell viability was quantified using a fluorescent live/dead cell assay following the manufacturer's protocol (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). The number of live and dead cells were counted from several fields (n = 4) from at least three separate wells for each experiment. To determine the percent of adherent HCSM cells calcein probe was added to the cells, and the amount of fluorescence was measured at excitation wavelength 485 nm and emission wavelength 535 nm using a Cytofluor II fluorescence plate reader (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Each measurement was performed in duplicate, and five fields were scanned for each well from three separate experiments. Cell Culture Plasminogen Activation Assay—HCSM cells were grown in 48-well tissue culture plates and incubated for 2 to 6 days in phenol red-free, serum-free culture medium in absence or presence of Aβ peptides. The conditioned medium samples were collected, and the cells were rinsed two times with 500 μl of fresh phenol-red free and serum-free culture medium and then replaced with 150 μl of fresh phenol red-free, serum-free medium. Purified Glu-plasminogen was added at a final concentration of 0.5 μm to the collected conditioned medium samples and the fresh phenol red-free, serum-free culture medium on the HCSM cells. The medium samples and cells were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C, and the generated plasmin activity in the samples was measured using the chromogenic substrate tosyl-Gly-Pro-Lys-p-nitroanilide in a Vmax microtiter plate reader as described previously (29Van Nostrand W.E. Porter M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11570-11576Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). HCSM Cell Plasminogen Activator Zymography—Near confluent cultures of HCSM cells were incubated in the absence or presence of 25 μm wild-type or Dutch mutant Aβ40 for 2 to 6 days. The culture medium was removed, and the cells were rinsed with PBS three times and then solubilized in a lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, and 5 mm EDTA. Aliquots of culture medium and cell lysates and known quantities of purified tPA and uPA were subjected to SDS-PAGE under non-reducing conditions. The completed gels were soaked in 2.5% Triton X-100 for 20 min at room temperature to remove the SDS. The gels were then soaked in water two times for 30 min at room temperature to remove the Triton X-100. The polyacrylamide gels were then overlaid on plasminogen/substrate gels composed of 1% agarose, 2.5% non-fat dry milk, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 2 μg/ml Glu-plasminogen. The stacked gels were placed in a sealed, humidified container and incubated for 12–16 h at 37 °C. Plasminogen activator activity was visualized as clearing zones in the underlying plasminogen/substrate gel and documented using a Fluor-S Multi-Imager (Bio-Rad) with the manufacturer's Quantity One software. mRNA Isolation and RNase Protection Assay—HCSM cells were grown to ∼90% confluency in T-225 cm2 flasks. The cells were incubated under serum-free conditions either in the absence or presence of 25 μm Dutch mutant Aβ40 for 6 days. Messenger RNA was isolated using the mRNA isolation kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and stored at –70 °C. Using avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), cDNA was made using ∼500 ng of HCSM cell mRNA, 60 pg/μl oligo(dT), 500 nm dNTP, incubated for 1 h at 41 °C. cDNA templates for riboprobes were generated using the following primers for uPA (GenBankTM accession number X02419; nucleotides 3350–4459): forward, 5′-GCTCTGTCACCTACGTGTGTG-3′; and reverse, 5′-GGAACCTTGCCTAGAAGT-3′; or for uPAR (GenBankTM accession number XM009232; nucleotides 660–1014): forward, 5′-CTATCGGACTGGCTTGAAGATCAC-3′; and reverse, 5′-GGTGGTGTTGCAGCATTTCAGGAAG-3′. PCR products of 244 and 354 bp for uPA and uPAR, respectively, were made and purified using a High Pure PCR product purification kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and digested with NotI and BamHI. The digested PCR products were purified by electrophoretic separation and subsequent extraction from a 0.8% agarose gel using the Gene-Clean II kit (BIO101, Vista, CA). The fragment was ligated into pBluescript (KS+) (Stratagene) at the BamHI-NotI site in an antisense direction using a rapid DNA ligation kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). DNA sequencing analysis verified the integrity of all the constructs. The uPA/Bluescript or uPAR/Bluescript construct was digested with PvuII and SacI. A 464and 540-bp fragment for uPA and uPAR, respectively, was purified by electrophoretic separation and subsequent extraction from a 0.8% agarose gel using the GeneClean II kit. For RNase protection assay, an antisense radiolabeled riboprobe was generated by using an in vitro transcription kit (Promega, Madison, WI) with ∼50 ng of uPA or uPAR fragment, T3 RNA polymerase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and 100 μCi of [α-32P]UTP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). As a control, the GAPDH housekeeping gene was made using 50 ng of GAPDH template (PharMingen) with T7 RNA polymerase (PharMingen). The radiolabeled antisense riboprobes were ethanol-precipitated and resuspended in 50 μl of hybridization buffer. Using an RNase protection assay kit (RiboQuant; PharMingen), 300–500 ng of HCSM cell mRNA or 4 μg of negative control tRNA was hybridized at 56 °C overnight with 100,000 cpm/μl of uPA, uPAR, or GAPDH radiolabeled antisense riboprobe. Free probe and single-stranded mRNA was digested with RNaseA and T1 for 45 min at 30 °C. Subsequent digestion was done with proteinase K at 37 °C for 15 min. The hybridized samples were purified with phenol/chloroform extraction and electrophoresed on a 6% TBE-urea gel (Invitrogen) under 180 V for 1 h. The resulting gel was fixed in 30% methanol/5% glycerol for 30 min followed by dehydration under vacuum at 80 °C for 2 h and analyzed by autoradiography. Quantitative Immunoblotting—Near confluent cultures of HCSM cells were incubated in the absence or presence of 25 μm Dutch mutant Aβ40 in serum-free medium for 6 days. In some experiments increasing concentrations of Glu-plasminogen were included. After incubation, the medium was collected, and the cells were rinsed with PBS three times and then solubilized in a lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 5 mm EDTA, and proteinase inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Aliquots of the medium or cell lysate samples were electrophoresed in either SDS 10% polyacrylamide gels or Tris-Tricine 10–20% polyacrylamide gels, and the proteins were transferred onto Hybond nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Biosciences). Unoccupied sites on the membranes were blocked overnight with 5% non-fat milk in PBS with 0.05% Tween 20. The membranes were probed with a monoclonal antibody to uPAR (American Diagnostica, Greenwich, CT) or monoclonal antibody 6E10 to Aβ (Signet Laboratories, Dedham, MA) and then incubated with a secondary peroxidase-coupled sheep anti-mouse IgG antibody at a dilution of 1:1000. The peroxidase activity on the membranes was detected using a Supersignal Dura West (Pierce), and bands were measured using a Fluor-S Multi-Imager (Bio-Rad) with the manufacturer's Quantity One software. Solid-phase Binding Assay—Dutch mutant Aβ40 was assembled into fibrils as described above, and 2 μg/well in 100 μl of PBS was dried down in triplicate wells of a 96-well microtiter plate (Corning Glass) overnight at 37 °C. The wells were rinsed with PBS three times and blocked with 100 μl/well PBS containing 1 mg/ml BSA for 1 h at room temperature. After rinsing three times with PBS, purified tPA (2 nm)or uPA (2 nm) in PBS containing 0.1 mg/ml BSA were incubated in triplicate (100 μl/well) for 1 h at room temperature. After rinsing the wells with PBS three times, 100 μl of rabbit anti-tPA or rabbit anti-uPA (1:1000) in PBS containing 0.1 mg/ml BSA was added for 1 h at room temperature. After rinsing the wells with PBS three times, 100 μl of HRP-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (1:1000) in PBS containing 0.1 mg/ml BSA was added for 1 h at room temperature. The binding of secondary antibody was detected using the TMB Microwell Peroxidase substrate (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories, Gaithersburg, MD) as described by the manufacturer. The conversion of the colorimetric substrate was measured at a wavelength of 450 nm using a Molecular Dynamics Vmax kinetic plate reader (Sunnyvale, CA). Pathogenic Aβ Stimulates the Expression and Cell Surface Accumulation of uPA in HCSM Cells—HCSM cells were treated in the absence of peptide or in the presence of wild-type or Dutch mutant Aβ40 for 2 to 6 days.

https://openalex.org/W2005784265,"Lowering of plasma triglyceride levels by hypolipidemic agents is caused by a shift in the liver cellular metabolism, which become poised toward peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) α-regulated fatty acid catabolism in mitochondria. After dietary treatment of rats with the hypolipidemic, modified fatty acid, tetradecylthioacetic acid (TTA), the energy state parameters of the liver were altered at the tissue, cell, and mitochondrial levels. Thus, the hepatic phosphate potential, energy charge, and respiratory control coefficients were lowered, whereas rates of oxygen uptake, oxidation of pyridine nucleotide redox pairs, β-oxidation, and ketogenesis were elevated. Moderate uncoupling of mitochondria from TTA-treated rats was confirmed, as the proton electrochemical potential (Δp) was 15% lower than controls. The change affected the ΔΨ component only, leaving the ΔpH component unaltered, suggesting that TTA causes induction of electrogenic ion transport rather than electrophoretic fatty acid activity. TTA treatment induced expression of hepatic uncoupling protein 2 (UCP-2) in rats as well as in wild type and PPARα-deficient mice, accompanied by a decreased double bond index of the mitochondrial membrane lipids. However, changes of mitochondrial fatty acid composition did not seem to be related to the effects on mitochondrial energy conductance. As TTA activates PPARδ, we discuss how this subtype might compensate for deficiency of PPARα.

A considerable body of evidence points to shifts in the liver cellular metabolism, resulting in channeling of fatty acids to an enhanced mitochondrial β-oxidation, at the expense of triacylglyceol synthesis. Simultaneously, there is up-regulation of the inner carnitine palmitoyltransferase II, 2,4-dienoyl-CoA reductase, and mitochondrial 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-CoA synthase. The outer carnitine palmitoyltransferase-I is not affected, suggesting that the rate control of β-oxidation and ketogenesis resides in steps beyond acyl group translocation into the matrix (4Berge R.K.

Modulation of lipid metabolism with TTA seems at least in part to be related to the role of TTA as a regulator for members of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) family of nuclear receptors.

Mitochondrial uncoupling by fatty acids has been widely demonstrated during the last decades. Energy coupling is impaired when protons and other ions are allowed to pass through the inner membrane without the production of ATP. Consequently, the stored energy from the mitochondrial proton gradient intended for ATP synthesis is converted to heat. Wojtczak et al. (10Wojtczak L. Wieckowski M.R. Schonfeld P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 357: 76-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) have demonstrated protonophoric behavior in vitro of high concentrations of 3-thia fatty acids toward the mitochondrial inner membrane. The concentration range causing rapid transbilayer movement of acyl chains was on par with that of normal, unipolar long chain fatty acids like palmitic or oleic acids. A similar behavior has been shown to apply to other hypolipidemic fatty acid analogues, such as β,β′-methyl-substitutedhexadecane-α,ω-dioic acid (11Hermesh O. Kalderon B. Bar-Tana J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3937-3942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The molecular basis for fatty acid-mediated uncoupling of respiration remains unclear, but both passive and protein-mediated mechanisms appear to be involved. Skulachev (12Skulachev V.P. FEBS Lett. 1991; 294: 158-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar) introduced the hypothesis of fatty acid cycling, assuming spontaneous translocation (flip-flop) of the protonated form of the fatty acid in one direction (toward matrix) and a transfer of the anionic form in the other direction, mediated by some inner membrane proteins. Putative candidates for such proteins are the ADP/ATP antiporter and the uncoupling proteins (UCPs) (12Skulachev V.P. FEBS Lett. 1991; 294: 158-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar, 13Jezek P. Engstova H. Zackova M. Vercesi A.E. Costa A.D. Arruda P. Garlid K.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1365: 319-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). UCP homologues form a family of mitochondrial carriers that are capable of depleting the proton gradient. The UCP subtypes, UCP-1, UCP-2, and UCP-3, differ in respect to tissue distribution and probably also function. UCP-1 appears to be solely expressed in brown adipose tissue where it mediates thermogenesis, whereas UCP-2 and UCP-3 are more widely expressed. The functions of UCP-2 and UCP-3 are still unclear, but a mild uncoupling of respiration could prevent the accumulation of oxygen radicals and/or control the NAD+/NADH ratio and consequently regulate metabolic pathways such as ketogenesis and lipogenesis (14Skulachev V.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1363: 100-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar, 15Ricquier D. Bouillaud F. Biochem. J. 2000; 345: 161-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar). The activities of the UCPs are induced by free fatty acids (16Jacobsen S.E. Fahlman C. Blomhoff H.K. Okkenhaug C. Rusten L.S. Smeland E.B. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 1665-1670Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Furthermore, mono- and polyunsaturated fatty acids, but not saturated fatty acids, were found to increase UCP-2 expression in hepatocytes possibly via a PPARα-mediated pathway (17Armstrong M.B. Towle H.C. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: E1197-E1204PubMed Google Scholar). Others have found that PPARα mediates in vivo regulation of hepatic ucp-2 gene expression and that PPARγ has the same property in brown adipose tissue (18Kelly L.J. Vicario P.P. Thompson G.M. Candelore M.R. Doebber T.W. Ventre J. Wu M.S. Meurer R. Forrest M.J. Conner M.W. Cascieri M.A. Moller D.E. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 4920-4927Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). These observations suggest the possibility that PPAR activation and increased β-oxidation rate in liver mitochondria of rats fed TTA might be associated with increased proton conductance across the membrane. We have investigated whether this occurs in vivo after long term feeding of TTA to rats, by measuring energy state parameters at the tissue level, the cellular level, as well as at the level of isolated mitochondria, and if so to assess the extent to which such a mechanism might contribute to increased fatty acid oxidation. Materials—TTA was synthesized as described previously (19Madsen L. Froyland L. Grav H.J. Berge R.K. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 554-563Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 3H2O, [U-14C]sucrose, [1-14C]palmitoyl-l-carnitine, [1-14C]palmitoyl-CoA, [3H]inulin, [3H]tetraphenylphosphonium (TTP), [14C]5,5′-dimethyloxazoline-2,4-dione, and dextran T-40 were obtained from Amersham Biosciences. Unlabeled species of the same compounds were purchased from Sigma. Saponin was from Fluka Chemica-Biochemica, Switzerland. Other chemicals were of the highest purity commercially available. Animals—Male Wistar rats were obtained from Møllegaard Breeding Laboratory, Eiby, Denmark. They were housed in pairs in wire cages and maintained on a 12-h cycle of light and dark at 20 ± 3 °C. The rats had free access to pellet food and water, and they were acclimatized to these conditions for at least 1 week prior to the experiment. Each test and control group consisted of at least 4 animals. If not otherwise stated, palmitic acid and TTA were separately dissolved in acetone and sprayed on pellets to an amount of 3 g/kg of pellets, resulting in an approximate daily dose of 300 mg/kg body weight (estimated consumption of pellets per rat, 20 g; body weight near 200 g). At day 7, the rats were subjected to a 12-h fast before termination. The PPAR–/– and PPAR+/+ mice (20–25 g) were a generous gift from Frank J. Gonzales (National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD) and have been described elsewhere (20Lee S.S. Pineau T. Drago J. Lee E.J. Owens J.W. Kroetz D.L. Fernandez-Salguero P.M. Westphal H. Gonzalez F.J. Mol. Cell Biol. 1995; 15: 3012-3022Crossref PubMed Scopus (1487) Google Scholar). The PPAR–/– and PPAR+/+ lines were purebred on a sv129 background. The mice were given a diet consisting of 21.8% casein, 10% soy oil, 17% vitamin/mineral mixture (5.83% vitamin mixture, AIN-93VX, Dyets Inc.; 17.4% mineral mixture, AIN-93G, Dyets Inc.; 11.6% cellulose; 63,9% sucrose; 1.2% cholintartrate) and dextrin (49.5–51.2%), supplemented with 0.5% fenofibrate (gift from Alan Edgar, Fournier, France) or 1.7% TTA. At termination the animals were anesthetized with a subcutaneous injection of Hypnorm Dormicum™ (fentanyl/fluanisone midazol-am, 0.2 ml/100 g body weight). Livers were either immediately removed, placed in ice-cold homogenizing medium and weighed, or freeze-clamped in situ and stored in liquid N2. Cardiac puncture was performed to obtain blood samples in EDTA vacutainers; one aliquot being frozen in liquid N2 for later measurement of blood nucleotides. The Norwegian State Board of Biological Experiments with Living Animals approved the protocol. Extraction and Measurement of Nucleotides—Nucleotides, including NAD+ and NADP+, were extracted with perchloric acid, whereas pyridine nucleotides in reduced form were obtained by alkaline extraction according to Williamson and Corkey (21Williamson J.R. Corkey B.E. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 55: 200-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Extracted nucleotides were separated, identified, and quantified on an ion pair reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatographic system (22Stocchi V. Cucchiarini L. Canestrari F. Piacentini M.P. Fornaini G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 167: 181-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Inorganic phosphate was determined by an assay based on the production of phosphomolybdate, which can be measured photometrically at 340 nm (Bayer AG, Leverkusen, Germany). The liver contents of each component were corrected for the amounts due to blood contaminating the tissue as described by Hohorst et al. (23Hohorst H.J. Kreutz F.H. Bücher T. Biochem. Z. 1959; 332: 18-46PubMed Google Scholar), by measurement of the oxyhemoglobin concentration, in the presence of saponin, of blood and liver tissue. Tissue energy parameters were calculated as follows: energy charge = ½{([ADP] + 2[ATP])/([AMP]+[ADP]+[ATP])} and phosphorylation state = [ATP]/[ADP][Pi] (nanomoles/g of tissue)–1 (see Ref. 24Krebs H.A. Veech R.L. Papa S. Tager J.M. Quagliariello E. Slater E.C. The Energy Level and Metabolic Control of Mitochondria. Ariatica Editrice, Bari, Italy1969: 329-382Google Scholar). Isolation of Mitochondria and Measurements of Enzyme Activities— The livers of individual animals were homogenized in an ice-cold medium consisting of 0.25 m sucrose, 10 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.4, 1 mm EGTA. The mitochondrial fraction was obtained by differential centrifugation as described earlier (25Berge R.K. Flatmark T. Osmundsen H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1984; 141: 637-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) at 0–4 °C. The Bio-Rad protein kit (Bio-Rad) was used for protein determination with bovine serum albumin (Sigma) as standard. Until used the mitochondrial fractions were stored at 0 °C at a concentration of 100 mg of protein/ml. Rates of oxygen consumption were measured polarographically as described earlier (26Grav H.J. Pedersen J.I. Christiansen E.N. Eur. J. Biochem. 1970; 12: 11-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), the system being calibrated with air-saturated distilled water. Measurements were made at 25.0 °C, and where not specified otherwise the medium contained the following components at the indicated concentrations: 83 mm KCl, 4 mm KH2PO4,20mm K-HEPES buffer, pH 7.4, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm MgCl2, and 4 mg of mitochondrial protein, in a total volume of 1.0 ml. Substrates were added as follows: 240 μm palmitoyl-l-carnitine + 5 mm malate (or 0.5 mm malate as indicated), 210 μm pamlitoyl-CoA + 1 mm l-carnitine + 5 mm malate (or 0.5 mm malate as indicated), or 5 mm sodium succinate + 1 μg of rotenone. Where indicated 40 μm FCCP was added near the end of the experiment. Rates of β-oxidation were determined by incubating mitochondria at 30 °C with [1-14C]palmitoyl-l-carnitine or [1-14C]palmitoyl-CoA + 1 mm l-carnitine, as described in Ref. 6Madsen L. Garras A. Asins G. Serra D. Hegardt F.G. Berge R.K. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1999; 57: 1011-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar. Preparation and Incubation of Primary Hepatocytes—Hepatocytes were prepared from rats by collagenase perfusion by a modification (27Seglen P.O. Methods Cell Biol. 1976; 13: 29-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (5190) Google Scholar) of the method of Berry and Friend (28Berry M.N. Friend D.S. J. Cell Biol. 1969; 43: 506-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (3601) Google Scholar). The final wash of cells in Ca2+-free phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, was performed at 37 °C in the presence of 1 mm l-carnitine 20 min prior to incubation, to compensate for carnitine lost from cells during preparative procedures (29Skorve J. Rustan A.C. Berge R.K. Lipids. 1995; 30: 987-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 30Tran T.N. Christophersen B.O. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1533: 255-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Production of acid-soluble products was measured using fatty acids as substrates. The assay mixture contained the following components in a total volume of 1.0 ml: 400 μm 1-14C-labeled fatty acid (0.25 μCi/ml) in Ca2+-free phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, containing 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 8 mm Na2HPO4, 1.5 mm KH2PO4, and 1% (w/v) fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin. Incubation was for 1 h at 30 °C in the presence of 2 × 106 cells. Acid-soluble products were measured essentially as given by Christiansen et al. (31Christiansen R. Borrebaek B. Bremer J. FEBS Lett. 1976; 62: 313-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Rates of oxygen uptake by cells were measured polarographically at 37 °C as given above for isolated mitochondria, except that the reaction mixture contained in a total volume of 1.0 ml: 400 μm fatty acid in Ca2+-free phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, containing 1% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin and 2 × 106 cells. The experiment was started with the addition of fatty acid substrate after a 10-min preincubation at 37 °C with an open measuring chamber. Where used, 5 μm FCCP was added near the end of each 10-min experiment. Rates of β-oxidation were measured as for isolated mitochondria (above) except that [1-14C]palmitic acid was used as substrate. Production of ketone bodies was assessed by measuring the amount of d-β-hydroxybutyrate (Sigma, kit number 310A) present in a neutralized, perchloric acid extract of the reaction mixture after completion of the polarographic experiment, and corrected for the contents of that component in unincubated cells. Measurement of Protein Motive Force—The proton electrochemical potential (Δp) were measured by recording the distribution across the mitochondrial inner membrane of labeled TTP as the permeant cation and labeled 5,5-dimetyloxazolidine-2,4-dione as the permeant weak acid, via centrifugation through an oil layer essentially as given by Dawson et al. (32Dawson A. Klingenberg M. Krämer R. Daley-Usmar V.W. Rickwood D. Wilson M.T. Mitochondria, A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford, UK1987: 35-78Google Scholar). Briefly, the electrical potential difference (ΔΨ) was measured by incubating mitochondria in a medium containing the following concentrations of components: 150 mm KCl, 5 mm K-HEPES, pH 7.4, 2.5 mm Tris phosphate, 0.5 mm malate, 10 mm 5,5-dimetyloxazolidine-2,4-dione, 100 μm inulin, 10 μm TTP, 50 mg of dextran 40 (to facilitate passage of mitochondria though an oil layer (33LaNoue K.F. Walajtys E.I. Williamson J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 7171-7183Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)), 0.18 μCi/ml [14C]TTP, and 10 mg of mitochondrial protein in a total of 2.0 ml. Incubation was performed in uncapped tubes at 25 °C. For measurement of the transmembrane pH difference (ΔpH), labeled TTP was exchanged for 0.18 μCi of [14C]5,5-dimetyloxazolidine-2,4-dione/ml + 0.6 μCi of [3H]inulin/ml. Experiments were started by addition of substrate, either 40 nmol of palmitoyl-l-carnitine/mg of mitochondrial protein, in the presence of 1 mm malate, pH 7.4, or 2.5 mm Tris succinate, pH 7.4, in the presence of 10 μg of rotenone. At 3 and 5 min appropriate samples were withdrawn and added to tubes previously charged with a silicon oil layer (ρ = 1.5) above a layer of 10% (w/v) perchloric acid (ρ = 1.8), followed by centrifugation for 1 min at 15,000 rpm (Eppendorf microcentrifuge). For the ΔΨ experiments, the disappearance of [14C] from the upper, incubation medium layer was recorded by subjecting aliquots of that layer to scintillation counting, whereas for the ΔpH experiments, aliquots were withdrawn from both the upper as well from the bottom (perchloric acid) layers, and subjected to dual-channel scintillation counting. Determination of intra-mitochondrial volume was made by recording the transmembrane distributions of [14C]sucrose and 3H2O (32Dawson A. Klingenberg M. Krämer R. Daley-Usmar V.W. Rickwood D. Wilson M.T. Mitochondria, A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford, UK1987: 35-78Google Scholar). The sucrose impermeable space of liver mitochondria isolated from animals given dietary palmitate was 1.27 ± 0.11 versus 1.28 ± 0.14 μl/mg of protein for the TTA-treated ones (n = 12). No correction was applied for possible overestimation of ΔΨ because of passive TTP binding since the measured ΔΨ was always higher than the figure where deviation from Nernst behavior has been demonstrated (34Warhurst I.W. An Investigation of the Anion Conducting Pore of Rat Liver Mitochondria. Doctoral dissertation, University of East Anglia, Norwich, United Kingdom1983Google Scholar). Parallel, polarographic incubations were used to verify that a steady state rate of oxygen uptake existed within the time frame of withdrawal of aliquots. Mitochondrial Fatty Acid Composition—TTA suspended in 0.5% carboxymethylcellulose was administered to rats by orogastric intubation (150 mg/kg body weight) once daily for 10 days. Control animals received carboxymethylcellulose only. PPAR–/– and PPAR+/+ mice were given the diet described above. Lipids were extracted from the liver mitochondrial fractions of rats and mice, transesterified with BF3-methanol, and analyzed essentially as described in Ref. 35Bjorndal B. Helleland C. Boe S.O. Gudbrandsen O.A. Kalland K.H. Bohov P. Berge R.K. Lillehaug J.R. J. Lipid Res. 2002; 43: 1630-1640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar. The methyl esters of fatty acids were analyzed on a GC 8000 Top gas chromatograph (Carlo Erba Instrument), equipped with a flame ionization detector, programmable temperature of vaporization injector, AS 800 autosampler (Carlo Erba Instrument), and a capillary column (60 m × 0.25 mm) containing a highly polar SP 2340 phase with film thickness 0.20 mm (Supelco). Natural occurring fatty acids were positively identified by comparison to known standards (Larodan Fine Chemicals, Malmö, Sweden) and verified by mass spectrometry. Quantification of the fatty acids was based on heneicosanoic acid (21:0) as an internal standard. Isolation of mRNA and Quantitation by Real-time PCR Analysis— Total RNA was extracted from freeze-clamped liver using Trizol™ reagent (Invitrogen). Quantitative real-time PCR was carried out using ABI PRISM™ 7900 HT sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) with conditions and reagents as recommended by the manufacturer. Each sample was analyzed in triplicate. Sequence-specific PCR primers and TaqMan probes for UCP-2 and the GAPDH cDNAs were designed using Primer Express software (Applied Biosystems). The following primers and probes were used: GAPDH: primers, 5′-TGCACCACCAACTGCTTAGC-3′ and 5′-CAGTCTTCTGAGTGGCAGTGATG-3′, and probe, 5′-TGGAAGGGCTCATGACCACAGTCCA-3′; UPC-2: primers, 5′-TGGCCTCTACGACTCTGTAAAGC-3′ and 5′-CAGGGCACCTGTGGTGCTA-3′, and probe, 5-CAAGGGCTCAGAGCATGCAGGCA-3′. The GAPDH was used as endogenous control for normalization of cDNA amounts. This analysis was also performed on isolated hepatocytes (performed as described above) that were purified by centrifugation on a 45% Percoll cushion to minimize the influence from Kuppfer cells (17Armstrong M.B. Towle H.C. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: E1197-E1204PubMed Google Scholar). Western Analysis—Protein from extracts were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Hybond ECL, Amersham) according to standard techniques. Blots were probed with a polyclonal goat antibody to UCP-2 (sc-6525, Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.) and goat horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody (Bio-Rad). Statistics and Presentation of Results—The data are presented as mean ± S.D., and differences were evaluated by a two-sample Student's t test (two-tailed distribution) where relevant. p < 0.05 was regarded as statistical significant. Energy Parameters in Rat Liver—To investigate whether the hypolipidemia caused by supplementing rat diets with 3-thia fatty acids is associated with perturbation of the liver energy state, we established a 7-day regime of feeding animals TTA compared with a set of control animals receiving palmitic acid (which does not cause hypolipidemia). TTA treatment resulted in a lowering of energy state parameters such as phosphate potential by 30% and energy charge by 13%, compared with control livers (Table I). Simultaneously, the liver NAD+/NADH and NADP+/NADPH redox pairs became more oxidized. Whereas the total amounts of adenine nucleotides or inorganic phosphate remained unaffected by the dietary treatment, the amounts of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide almost doubled and that of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate increased by 30%, strongly suggesting that TTA stimulates the biosynthetic pathways for pyridine nucleotides in liver or, alternatively, inhibits glycohydrolases, which converts NAD to nicotinamide.Table IChanges in contents and composition of nucleotides in livers of rats given TTA versus palmitic acid as dietary supplementNucleotide componentsDietary supplementPalmitic acidTTAAMP + ADP + ATP3898 ± 343769 ± 131NSaNS, not significant for differences between TTA- and palmitic acid-treated rats; n = 5.GDP + GTP479 ± 34425 ± 17*bp < 0.05.NAD + NADH781 ± 361421 ± 101†cp < 0.01.NADP + NADPH338 ± 23457 ± 18*Inorganic phosphate3500 ± 6133678 ± 174NSTissue energy parameters[NAD]/[NADH]27.1 ± 1.2258.4 ± 4.3†[NADP]/[NADPH]0.40 ± 0.120.60 ± 0.06†Phosphorylation state497 ± 69340 ± 35†Energy charge0.73 ± 0.030.64 ± 0.06*a NS, not significant for differences between TTA- and palmitic acid-treated rats; n = 5.b p < 0.05.c p < 0.01. Open table in a new tab Oxidative Capacities of Primary Hepatocytes from TTA-treated Rats—Hepatocytes prepared from animals given TTA versus palmitic acid in their diets would be expected to expose facets of a mechanism for lowering the liver energy state. Accordingly, a study was undertaken of cellular production of acid-soluble products from labeled fatty acid substrates (as a measure of β-oxidation) as well as of fatty acid-stimulated ketogenesis and respiratory rates. As shown in Table II, TTA feeding caused increases in rates of cellular β-oxidation by 1.4–1.9-fold, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) being the better substrate among the fatty acids supplied. Stimulation by TTA feeding on ketogenesis in cells was more pronounced for palmitic acid (2-fold) and EPA (1.9-fold) than for docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; 1.5-fold) as sources of carbon. The fatty acid-stimulated rates of oxygen uptake responded similarly (1.3-fold increase) to TTA feeding of source animals. The oxygen uptake rates measured in the uncoupled state (preincubation with FCCP) were almost identical with any fatty acid substrate, regardless of feeding regime, indicating that the capacity of the mitochondrial respiratory chain had not been altered by the diet supplement. However, as a consequence there was some indication of a lowering of energy transducing activity in cells f"

Cell. 2001; 1: 567-578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), the molecular mechanisms of how dSmurf affects DPP signaling remain unexplored. Toward this goal we demonstrated the degradation of phosphorylated MAD by dSmurf. dSmurf selectively interacted with MAD, but not Medea and Dad, and the MAD-dSmurf interaction was induced by constitutively active DPP type I receptor thickveins. Wild type dSmurf, but not its C1029A mutant, mediated ubiquitination-dependent degradation of MAD. Silencing of dSmurf using RNA interference stabilized MAD protein in Drosophila S2 cells. Targeted expression of dSmurf in various tissues abolished phosphorylated MAD and disrupted patterning and growth. In contrast, similar overexpression of inactive dSmurf(C1029A) showed no significant effects on development. We conclude that dSmurf specifically targets phosphorylated MAD to proteasome-dependent degradation and regulates DPP signaling during development.

DPP signals through cell surface receptors and intracellular Smad proteins. In Drosophila, all three classes of Smads, R-Smad (MAD, dSmad2), Co-Smad (Medea), and I-Smad (Dad), have been characterized (2Raftery L. Sutherland D. Dev. Biol. 1999; 210: 251-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). MAD, the founding member of Smad family (5Sekelsky J. Newfeld S. Raftery L. Chartoff E. Gelbart W. Genetics. 1995; 139: 1347-1358Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), transduces the signal of DPP, while dSmad2 mediates TGF-β/Activin signaling (2Raftery L. Sutherland D. Dev. Biol. 1999; 210: 251-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar).Ubiquitin conjugation is catalyzed by an enzymatic cascade including ubiquitin-activating E1, ubiquitin-conjugating E2, and specific ubiquitin E3 ligase. The specificity of ubiquitination derives from the highly specific protein-protein interaction between E3 ligase and substrate (6Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev.

Recently, a Drosophila ligase E3 dSmurf has been identified by genetic screen (1Podos S. Hanson K. Wang Y. Ferguson E. Dev. Cell. 2001; 1: 567-578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar); the null mutation of dSmurf resulted in a lethal defect in hindgut organogenesis. However, the mechanisms underlying dSmurf actions in DPP signaling and embryogenesis remain unclear.In this study, we present biochemical and genetic evidence for the biological functions of dSmurf. The results revealed that dSmurf specifically inhibited DPP signaling by targeting DPP-activated MAD, not dSmad2, Medea, or Dad, for ubiquitination/proteasome-dependent proteolysis. Targeted overexpression of dSmurf in imaginal discs strongly reduces the level of phosphorylated MAD and consequently causes disruption of DPP-dependent patterning of imaginal discs, demonstrating that dSmurf is a negative regulator of DPP signaling in vivo.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMolecular Cloning—dSmurf were obtained by using PCR with primers (forward: gGAATTC aat aaa ttg gat tac cca cgt and reverse: ttcGTC-GAC tta ctc cac ggc aaa tcc aca) from total fly cDNA (Clontech) or Lack cDNA clone (gift of Scott Hawley), and cloned into the EcoRI and SalI of pXF1F or pXF1M, for making FLAG-tagged or Myc-tagged dSmurf, respectively. His-tagged MAD is made by subcloning into a mammalian expression vector pXF2RH (9Lin X. Liang M. Feng X.-H. J. Biol.

MAD, dSmad2, and Dad were obtained by PCR from respective cDNA (gifts of Kohei Miyazono and Richard Padgett) and cloned into a yeast bait vector pEG202. dSmurf wild type and the dSmurf deletion mutants, obtained by PCR, were cloned into prey vector pJG4–5 at sites of EcoRI and SalI. Smurf1 (gift of Jeff Wrana) was also subcloned into pJG4–5. β-Galactosidase activity is measured by liquid assay according to the method of Matchmaker two-hybrid system 2 (Clontech).Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot—Culture and transfection of human kidney 293T cells and Drosophila Schneider S2 cells, and coupled immunoprecipitation-Western blot assays were carried out as described previously (13Feng X.-H.

In the case of RNA interference experiment (Fig. 4D), cells were cotransfected with synthetic 21-nucleotide duplex RNA (double-stranded RNA) of dSmurf (15Elbashir S.M. Harborth J. Lendeckel W.

Cells were induced by 0.5 mm CuSO4 for 24 h and then harvested for Western blot analysis.For ubiquitination assay, 293T cells were cotransfected by His-tagged MAD, HA-tagged ubiquitin, and c-Myc-tagged dSmurf. Proteasome inhibitor MG-132 was added to the transfected cells to prevent degradation of MAD. 48 h after transfection, cell lysates were subjected to precipitation using nickel-NTA-agarose beads and to detect ubiquitinated MAD as described previously (9Lin X.

For immunocytochemistry, imaginal discs from the progeny Gal4>UAS larvae were double stained with mouse anti-Flag (1:250) and rabbit anti-pMAD (1:250) with fluorescein isothiocyanate- and Cy3-conjugated fluorescent secondary antibodies as described previously (17Cho K.O.

Cell. 2001; 1: 567-578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) also identified dSmurf in a genetic screen (1Podos S. Hanson K. Wang Y. Ferguson E. Dev. Cell. 2001; 1: 567-578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). As a first step to determine whether dSmurf modulates DPP signaling in Drosophila, we investigated the physical interaction of this putative ubiquitin E3 ligase with members of the Smad family in Drosophila. We found that dSmurf only interacted with MAD, but not with dSmad2, Medea, or Dad. (Fig. 1B). Therefore, unlike its mammalian homologs Smurf1/2 that bind to both R-Smads and I-Smads, dSmurf specifically interacts with DPP-specific MAD.Fig. 1dSmurf specifically interacts with MAD via the WW2/WW3 domains. A, schematic diagram of dSmurf constructs and summary of dSmurf-MAD interaction. C2 domain, three WW domains, and HECT domain are shown. Interaction of these dSmurf variants with MAD in C are summarized. B, Specific interaction of dSmurf and MAD in yeast two-hybrid assay. Yeast EGY48 cells transformed with indicated bait plasmid (pEG202-Smad), the prey plasmid pJG4–5/Smurf, and a β-galactosidase reporter plasmid were grown in liquid culture. β-Galactosidase assay was done as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Interaction was scored with yeast culture in medium containing glucose (basal level) or galactose/raffinose (inducible level). C, mapping of MAD-interacting domain. Yeast two-hybrid assays were used to map the domains of dSmurf responsible for MAD-dSmurf interactions. Result is also shown in A.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To locate the interacting domains of dSmurf, we generated deletion and point mutations in dSmurf and assessed their interaction of MAD. The result showed that the entire WW2/WW3 region of dSmurf (amino acids 513–602) was required for the interaction with MAD, whereas the WW2 or WW3 domain alone did not interact with MAD (Fig. 1C). Notably, the same WW2/WW3 region with point mutations in WW2 domain (W541F/P544A) completely lost the interaction with MAD. These data suggest that the interaction of dSmurf binds to MAD through the WW2/WW3 domain.DPP Receptor Activation Augments dSmurf-MAD Interaction—We next assessed the MAD-dSmurf interaction in vivo. To prevent MAD degradation, we used the C1029A mutant of dSmurf to determine its interaction with Smads. The C1029A mutant carries a cysteine-to-alanine substitution at amino acid residue 1029 that is essential for catalysis. As shown in Fig. 2A, dSmurf coimmunoprecipitated with MAD, but not with dSmad2, Medea, and Dad, in agreement with the interaction pattern from yeast two-hybrid analysis. caTKV, constitutively active form of type I receptor Thick-veins (18Brummel T.

Basler K. Cell. 1994; 78: 225-237Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar), enhanced the interaction between MAD and dSmurf (Fig. 2, A and B).Fig. 2DPP stimulates dSmurf-MAD interaction. A, dSmurf binds to MAD in cells. 293T cells were transfected with plasmids for FLAG-tagged Smad (MAD, dSmad2, Medea, or Dad) and Myc-tagged dSmurf(C1029A). dSmurf complex was immunoprecipitated using anti-Myc antibody, followed by a Western blot to detect dSmurf-associated MAD. Expression levels of dSmurf and Smads in whole cell lysates were shown as indicated. Asterisk indicates a nonspecific band close to the molecular mass of Medea. Note that dSmurf-MAD interaction is stronger in the presence of constitutively active TKV (compared lane 7 with lane 2). B, mutation in the C-terminal phosphorylation sites of MAD abolishes dSmurf-MAD interaction. 293T cells were transfected with indicated plasmids. Immunoprecipitation-Western blotting was similarly carried out to A, except that anti-MAD (Smad1, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) antibody was used for immunoprecipitation and anti-FLAG (dSmurf) for Western blotting to detect MAD-bound dSmurf. MAD(SA) contains point mutations at Ser-453 and Ser-455 into Ala. Expression levels of dSmurf and MAD in whole cell lysates were shown as indicated. Level of pMAD in the immunoprecipitate was also shown. C, endogenous MAD binds to dSmurf. GST-dSmurf-(513–612) was used to pull down endogenous MAD from S2 cell lysates, transfected with caTKV and/or treated with proteasome inhibitor MG-132 (as indicated). dSmurf-bound MAD was detected by anti-Smad1 (upper panels) or anti-phospho-Smad1 (lower panels) antibodies. NS, a nonspecific band. D, dSmurf interacts with activated dSmad2. 293T cells were transfected with indicated plasmids, and immunoprecipitation-Western blotting was similarly carried out as described in the legend to A. caActRIB, constitutively active ActRIB.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To examine the importance of the phosphorylation motif SSXS, we generated double mutations in MAD at Ser-433 and Ser-435, which were changed into Ala and presumably unphosphorylatable by TKV. Result in Fig. 2B clearly showed that the interaction between this mutant, named MAD(SA), and dSmurf was not detectable regardless of the presence of caTKV, whereas wild type MAD strongly interacted with dSmurf in the presence of caTKV. Furthermore, dSmurf also had stronger binding to endogenous phospho-MAD, which can be further enhanced by proteasome inhibitor MG-132 (Fig. 2C). Interestingly, dSmurf also interacts with dSmad2 in the presence of caActR1B (Fig. 2D), suggesting that dSmad2 phosphorylation is necessary for its binding to dSmurf (despite the absence of such interaction in yeast two-hybrid assay as shown in Fig. 1). Therefore, data presented in Fig. 2 clearly demonstrate the important involvement of SSXS phosphorylation in Smad interaction with dSmurf.dSmurf Mediates Ubiquitination of MAD—To dissect the function of dSmurf as a ubiquitin E3 ligase, we tested whether dSmurf stimulated the ubiquitination of MAD. As shown in Fig. 3, wild type dSmurf was capable of enhancing ubiquitination of MAD protein (lane 3), while no ubiquitination was observed with MAD alone (lane 1). Markedly, the C1029A mutant of dSmurf could not conjugate HA-ubiquitin to MAD (lane 4). This suggests that the catalytic activity of dSmurf is required for the ubiquitination of MAD.Fig. 3dSmurf ubiquitinates MAD. 293T cells were transfected with expression plasmids for His-tagged MAD, HA-tagged ubiquitin, and Myc-dSmurf. His-MAD was pulled down from cell lysates using nickel-NTA-agarose beads (Ni-NTA ppt) and then subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting analysis using anti-HA antibodies to detect the pool of ubiquitinated MAD (upper). Levels of MAD in cells were detected using anti-His antibody (bottom). dSmurf(CA) is the catalytically inactive mutant of dSmurf with C1029A point mutation. Ubiquitinated MAD is marked.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)dSmurf Promotes Proteolytic Degradation of MAD—Having established that dSmurf mediated MAD ubiquitination, we next examined the MAD degradation in Drosophila S2 and human 293T cells. In S2 cells, the MAD protein level was reduced dramatically by overexpressed dSmurf (Fig. 4A). Similarly, dSmurf degraded MAD in 293T cells in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4B). In sharp contrast, the C1029A mutant did not decrease the steady state level of MAD (Fig. 4B).We next examined the role of phosphorylation of MAD in dSmurf-mediated degradation. It was clear that activated type I receptor further enhanced the degradation of MAD protein in dSmurf-overexpressing cells (Fig. 4A, compare lane 4 with lane 3), consistent with increased phosphorylation level (data not shown). Most notably, addition of proteasome inhibitor MG-132 inhibited MAD degradation caused by dSmurf (Fig. 4A, lane 5).We then took a loss-of-function approach to examine the MAD degradation by depleting the dSmurf expression. S2 cells were transfected with MAD and Myc-dSmurf and treated with or without a 21-nucleotide double-stranded RNA that targets dSmurf (si-dSmurf). We could detect more MAD protein with increased concentration (20, 40, and 100 nm) of the siRNA (Fig. 4C). Simultaneously, reduced dSmurf protein level was detected by anti-Myc antibody (lower panel, Fig. 4C). Importantly, an increased endogenous phospho-MAD protein level was detected after 100 nm si-dSmurf treatment (Fig. 4D), suggesting the silencing of endogenous dSmurf by si-dSmurf.Overexpression of dSmurf Leads to Loss of Phospho-MAD and Disruption of Imaginal Disc Development—DPP signaling is essential for patterning of imaginal discs. DPP is expressed along the anterior-posterior border of the wing disc and activated phospho-MAD is expressed in wider area around the AP border. Using UAS-Gal4 targeted expression system (20Brand A. Perrimon N. Development (Camb.). 1993; 118: 401-415Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we tested whether overexpression of dSmurf along the AP border can reduce or abolish phospho-MAD. As expected, when dSmurf expression was targeted to the AP border using ptc-Gal4, there was a strong reduction of phospho-MAD level in the ptc expression domain (Fig. 5). ptc-Gal4;UAS-dSmurf (ptc>dSmurf) flies failed to eclose due to severe developmental defects. Pharate adult flies removed from the pupal case showed rudimentary wings (Fig. 5L) and truncated legs (not shown), indicating strong reduction of DPP signaling. In contrast, overexpression of catalytically inactive dSmurf in ptc>dSmurf(C1029A) showed no significant defects in appendages. Wing discs from ptc>dSmurf(C1029A) showed slight increases in the level of phospho-MAD (Fig. 5, E–G), suggesting that dSmurfCA may titrate the function of normal dSmurf.Fig. 5dSmurf degrades MAD in vivo and disrupts wing disc development. Wing discs from wild-type (A–D), ptc>dSmurf(C1029A) (E–H), and ptc>dSmurf (I–L) were stained with anti-β-galactosidase (red) and anti-pMAD (green). A, pMAD is distributed in the medial wing pouch region of the normal disc. Its level is lower in the Ptc domain at the anterior-posterior (AP) border (arrowhead). B and C, schematic of Ptc (red) and pMAD (green) domains in the wing disc. A and P indicate anterior and posterior, respectively. D, wild type adult wing. E–G, overexpression of dSmurf(C1029A) using ptc-Gal4 causes no decrease in pMAD level. Instead, pMAD level is slightly increased in the Ptc domain (arrow, compare the Ptc domains in A and E). H, wings from ptc> dSmurf(C1029A) adult flies are almost normal. I–K, overexpression of dSmurf using ptc-Gal4 results in strong reduction of pMAD along the anterior-posterior border. L, adults with ptc>dSmurf show only rudimentary wings.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)DISCUSSIONIn this study, we have elucidated the mechanism underlying dSmurf-MAD interaction and characterized the biological function of dSmurf in Drosophila. dSmurf preferentially interacts with phosphorylated MAD (pMAD). The preferential binding of dSmurf to pMAD is similar to a previously reported Smurf2 binding to phosphorylated Smad2 (9Lin X. Liang M. Feng X.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36818-36822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). Furthermore, for the first time we demonstrate that mutation in the SSXS motif of MAD abolished its binding to dSmurf, highlighting the important role of MAD phosphorylation in its degradation. This phosphorylation-dependent MAD-dSmurf interaction is contrary to a previously proposed model that Smurfs target non-phosphorylated Smad1/MAD for degradation and thus reduces the cell competence to BMP/DPP signals (1Podos S. Hanson K. Wang Y. Ferguson E. Dev. Cell. 2001; 1: 567-578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 8Zhu H. Kavsak P. Abdollah S. Wrana J.L. Thomsen G. Nature. 1999; 400: 687-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation-dependent mechanism, as also discussed (21Arora K. Warrior R. Dev. Cell. 2001; 1: 441-442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), is consistent to the disappearance of pMAD in dSmurf-overexpressing transgenic flies (Fig. 5) and also agrees with the increased pMAD level in dSmurf-null mutants (1Podos S. Hanson K. Wang Y. Ferguson E. Dev. Cell. 2001; 1: 567-578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). While at present it is not clear how the phosphorylation controls the dSmurf-mediated MAD degradation, three possible mechanisms can be envisioned. First, phosphorylation of the SSXS motif disrupts the intrinsic MH1-MH2 interaction and results in an exposed PPXY motif in the linker region for dSmurf binding. Second, dSmurf interaction with MAD depends on the nuclear entry of MAD, which is induced by ligand. The third possibility is that the phosphorylated SSXS motif may be directly involved in MAD binding to dSmurf. Besides PPXY motif, phosphoserine (Ser(P)) residues also serves as ligand for WW domain (22Lu P. Zhou X. Shen M. Lu K. Science. 1999; 283: 1325-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). It will be interesting to determine whether one of WW domains of dSmurf can directly bind to the phosphorylated SSXS motif of MAD.dSmurf also interacts with dSmad2 dependent of receptor activation. The binding specificity of dSmurf is similar to that of its structurally related Smurf2 which binds both BMP- and activin-activated R-Smads in vertebrates (9Lin X. Liang M. Feng X.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36818-36822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar, 10Zhang Y. Chang C. Gehling D. Hemmati-Brivanlou A. Derynck R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 974-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). One remaining question is whether dSmurf also targets dSmad2 for degradation. Since activin signaling through dSmad2 appears to have no effects on patterning of wing development (23Brummel T. Abdollah S. Haerry T. Shimell M. Merriam J. Raftery L. Wrana J. O'Connor M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 98-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), the hypothetical dSmurf-mediated dSmad2 degradation in the wing imaginal disc should have no contributions to the severe phenotype observed in the dSmurf transgenic flies. It is the disappearance of phophos-MAD that completely shuts down DPP signaling during wing development.Unlike its vertebrate homologs, dSmurf fails to interact with DAD, the inhibitory Smad in fly. In vertebrates, Smurf1 and Smurf2 can form a strong association with Smad6 and Smad7 (12Ebisawa T. Fukuchi M. Murakami G. Chiba T. Tanaka K. Imamura T. Miyazono K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12477-12480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar), which may promote the degradation of TGF-β receptors (11Kavsak P. Rasmussen R.K. Causing C. Bonni S.

While the physiological role of mammalian Smurf in controlling receptor homeostasis remains to be clarified, dSmurf has no apparent functions in the proteolytic degradation of DPP receptors.

DPP signals through cell surface receptors and intracellular Smad proteins. In Drosophila, all three classes of Smads, R-Smad (MAD, dSmad2), Co-Smad (Medea), and I-Smad (Dad), have been characterized (2Raftery L. Sutherland D. Dev.

A short Pu region centered at position –104 was found to be involved in the interaction with σ54-RNAP, both in the absence and in the presence of IHF protein. Deletion or scrambling of the –104 region strongly reduced promoter affinity in vitro and promoter activity in vivo, respectively. The reduction in promoter affinity coincided with the loss of IHF-mediated recruitment of the σ54-RNAP in vitro. The experiments with oriented-α σ54-RNAP derivatives containing bound chemical nuclease revealed interchangeable positioning of only one of the two α subunit carboxyl-terminal domains (αCTDs) both at the –104 region and in the surroundings of position –78. The addition of IHF resulted in perfect position symmetry of the two αCTDs. These results indicate that, in the absence of IHF, the σ54-RNAP asymmetrically uses only one αCTD subunit to establish productive contacts with upstream sequences of the Pu promoter. In the presence of IHF-induced curvature, the closer proximity of the upstream DNA to the body of the σ54-RNAP can allow the other αCTD to be engaged in and thus favor closed complex formation.

The core promoter elements are signature tags for σ factor selectivity (4Ishihama A. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2000; 54: 499-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar).

In the last decade, a considerable amount of attention has been given to a A + T-rich promoter sequence, the UP element, located upstream of the core promoter region and consisting of two distinct subsites, each of which, by itself, can be bound by the carboxyl-terminal domain of the RNAP α subunit (αCTD) (3Ross W.

The A + T-rich sequence of the UP element are needed to provide the optimum width of minor groove for interaction with αCTD (7Ross W. Ernst A. Gourse R.L.

Biol. 2001; 306: 213-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence showed that the role of the UP elements is to stimulate transcription in an activator protein-independent manner and to a different extent (from 1.5 to ∼90-fold) depending on the similarity with the consensus UP element sequence (3Ross W. Aiyar S.E. Salomon J. Gourse R.L. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 5375-5383Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Estrem S.T. Gaal T. Ross W. Gourse R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9761-9766Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). It is currently believed that the transcription stimulation by an UP element has to be traced mainly to the cooperation of the sigma factor and the α subunit in RNAP binding to the promoter (1Busby S. Ebright R.H. Cell. 1994; 79: 743-746Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar, 12Fredrick K. Helmann J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4982-4987Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Thus, the presence of an UP element in a promoter plays the major role of increasing the initial equilibrium constant of closed complex formation between RNAP and promoter DNA (13Rao L. Ross W.

This linker flexibility also accounts for the ability of the two copies of αCTD to function interchangeably with respect to the subsite recognition within the UP element (10Estrem S.T. Ross W.

Sufficient length of the linker between αCTD and αNTD is also needed for UP element-dependent transcription activation. The linker is flexible but structured to a certain extent to facilitate the positioning of the αCTD to a proper location for interaction with the UP element (23Fujita N. Endo S. Ishihama A.

UP-like elements were also found in promoters recognized by alternative sigma factors, such as the σD-dependent flagellin promoter of Bacillus subtilis (24Fredrick K. Caramori T. Chen Y.F. Galizzi A.

Nature. 1992; 358: 422-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), (ii) DNA enhancer sequences (known as upstream activating sequences or UAS) targets for the activators of the σ54-RNAP, usually located at >100 bp from the transcription start site, and (iii) an intervening sequence between UAS and –12/–24 motif that may contain a target site of the IHF (32Rice P.A.

Cell. 1996; 87: 1295-1306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar), which, by its ability to bind and bend DNA sequences, assists the looping out required to bring closer together the σ54-activator prebound at UAS and σ54-RNAP assembled in a closed complex with –12/–24 DNA region. The productive contact between σ54-activator and σ54-RNAP closed complex triggers promoter opening (open complex) and eventually transcription initiation (33Gralla J.D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 530-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 34Zhang X. Chaney M. Wigneshweraraj S.R. Schumacher J. Bordes P. Cannon W. Buck M. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 45: 895-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Within this typical modular scheme for σ54-dependent promoters, the P. putida Pu promoter presents unique features. In fact, our previous results showed the additional IHF role of stimulating the otherwise limiting step of closed complex formation between σ54-RNAP and Pu DNA (26Bertoni G. Fujita N. Ishihama A. de Lorenzo V. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5120-5128Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 35Carmona M. de Lorenzo V. Bertoni G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33790-33794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). We also showed that the recognition of Pu promoter by σ54-RNAP involves not only the –12/–24 region but also a functional equivalent of an UP element located in the intervening region, upstream to the IHF binding site. Furthermore, our data strongly suggested that the Pu UP element could play a key role in the IHF-mediated stimulation of closed complex formation by σ54-RNAP. In this work, we closely inspected the interactions, both in the presence and absence of IHF, between σ54-RNAP and the Pu intervening region located upstream the IHF binding site. The data strongly support the notion of a non-canonical arrangement of the stimulating DNA sequences functioning as UP element. σ54-RNAP upstream interactions concentrate on two sites located in the surroundings of positions –104 and –78, respectively, thus being distant about 25 bp. In the absence of IHF and probably due to asymmetrical positioning of the upstream DNA, the two sites can be contacted interchangeably only by one αCTDs of the α2ββ′σ54 complex constituting the σ54-RNAP. On the contrary, the bending by IHF apparently introduces symmetry to the nucleoprotein complex allowing the other αCTD to interact with the two sites. Thus, the IHF-mediated stimulation of closed complex would result from curvature-dependent increased probability of wide range upstream interactions by σ54-RNAP through the αCTDs.

The Pu version, cloned in pUC-PuClaI-79, derived from pEZ9 and bearing a ClaI site engineered within positions –79 and –84 (26Bertoni G. Fujita N. Ishihama A. de Lorenzo V. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5120-5128Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), was subjected to site-directed mutagenesis by the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) to engineer a XhoI site within nucleotides –121 to –126. This procedure generated the plasmid pUC-PuClaXho. The replacement of the 47-bp XhoI-ClaI fragment of pUC-PuClaXho for synthetic XhoI-ClaI fragments harboring scrambled sequences from nucleotides –105 to –120 and from –95 to –120 gave rise to plasmids pUC-PuScra1 and pUC-PuScra2, respectively. The Pu versions present in pUC-PuClaXho, pUC-PuScra1, and pUC-PuScra2, respectively, were rescued as 312-bp EcoRI-BamH fragments, fused to lacZ by cloning in the corresponding sites of pBK16 vector (36Kessler B. de Lorenzo V.

Labeled fragments, added to the buffer at a final concentration of 5 nm, were incubated with 100 nm IHF, 60 nm core RNAP, and a 3-fold molar excess of σ54 factor for 25 min at 30 °C. The entire reaction volume was loaded onto non-denaturing 4% polyacrylamide gels (acrylamide:bis ratio 80:1) in 0.5× TBE buffer (45 mm Tris borate, pH 8.3, 0.1 mm EDTA, 5 mm MgCl2), electrophoresed at 12 mm at 4 °C for 6 h, and dried. Bands were visualized and quantified by Typhoon 8600 variable mode imager (Amersham Biosciences) upon storage phosphor autoradiography. DNA footprinting assays were performed in a total volume of 50 μl and with similar concentrations of end-labeled fragments and proteins used in the gel mobility-shift assays. For DNase I footprinting, after preincubation of end-labeled Pu DNA and proteins in transcription buffer for 25 min at 30 °C, 3 ng of DNase I were added to each sample and further incubated for 3.5 min. Reactions were stopped by addition of 25 μl of STOP buffer containing 0.1 m EDTA, pH 8, 0.8% SDS, 1.6 m NH4Ac, and 300 μg/ml sonicated salmon sperm DNA. Nucleic acids were precipitated with 175 μl of ethanol, lyophilized and directly resuspended in denaturing loading buffer (7 m urea, 0.025% bromphenol blue, and 0.025% xylene cyanol in 20 mm Tris, pH 8) prior to loading on a 7% DNA sequencing gel. A + G Maxam and Gilbert reactions (41Maxam A.M. Gilbert W. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 65: 499-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (9013) Google Scholar) were carried out with the same fragments and loaded onto the gels along with the footprinting samples.

Reactions were stopped by addition of 15 μl of 0.1 m thiourea and 25 μl of STOP buffer (as above), respectively. Nucleic acids were precipitated with 200 μl of ethanol and treated for separation and visualization as described above for DNase I footprinting. For DNA footprinting in the presence of (Fe·BABE)-RNAPs, after preincubation of end-labeled Pu DNA and proteins for 25 min at 30 °C in hydroxyl radical buffer, 1 μl each of 100 mm ascorbate and 0.6% hydrogen peroxide were added to the samples and then incubated for a further 15 min.

Nucleic acids were precipitated with 200 μl of ethanol and treated for separation and visualization as described above for DNase I footprinting. σ 54-RNAP Per Se Can Contact Sequence Elements Located Upstream the IHF Binding Site of Pu Promoter—The affinity of σ54-RNAP for Pu promoter DNA lacking the sequence region located upstream the position –79 is strongly reduced (Fig. 1) (26Bertoni G. Fujita N. Ishihama A. de Lorenzo V. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5120-5128Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). These data suggested that σ54-RNAP could utilize per se additional DNA affinity elements located far upstream of the –12/–24 region involved in the interaction with σ54. Since αCTD-deleted derivatives of σ54-RNAP showed reduced promoter affinity (26Bertoni G. Fujita N. Ishihama A. de Lorenzo V. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5120-5128Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), we also suggested that αCTD could be directly involved in the recognition of such upstream DNA, reminiscent, in this case, of the UP elements of σ70 promoters. Furthermore, an αCTD/UP-like interaction also seemed to be involved in the mechanism behind the stimulation of closed complex formation between Pu DNA and σ54-RNAP on IHF binding and bending, which we referred to as IHF-mediated recruitment of σ54-RNAP to the Pu promoter (26Bertoni G. Fujita N. Ishihama A. de Lorenzo V. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5120-5128Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). To map the contact sites of σ54-RNAP upstream –79 position and to reveal any possible influence of IHF-induced bending on these upstream contacts, we carried out either DNase I and hydroxyl radical footprinting assays on end-labeled DNA fragments bearing the entire Pu mixed with increasing amounts of σ54-RNAP, both in the presence and in the absence of sub-saturating concentrations of purified IHF. As shown in Fig. 2A (lanes 1–3), the footprint of the σ54-RNAP in the region spanning approximately from –83 to –108 consisted in a generalized hypersensitivity to DNase I. The addition of IHF (Fig. 2A, lanes 4 and 5) caused a further slight increase of upstream DNA reactivity to DNase I, with the exception of positions –90 and –91, appearing to be more protected from DNase I cleavage than when in the presence of σ54-RNAP alone. Similar conditions of labeled Pu DNA/protein ratio were employed to perform hydroxyl radical footprinting assays (Fig. 2B). The inspection of the Pu DNA sequence upstream of the IHF binding site revealed both protected and hypersensitive sites in a region spanning from –95 to –109. In particular, as shown in Fig. 2B (lanes 1–4), the hydroxyl radical footprint of σ54-RNAP consisted of three hypersensitive positions, –103 to –105, which seemed to be flanked by short protected regions. Apparently, the addition of IHF protein (Fig. 2B, lanes 5–7) caused minimal changes to the pattern of hydroxyl radical cutting. Examined together, these results strongly indicated that, even when unassisted, σ54-RNAP can establish contacts to DNA sites located far upstream of the –12/–24 region. In the case of the hydroxyl radical footprint, the DNA region involved in interactions with σ54-RNAP appeared to be limited to a short sequence in the surroundings of position –104, which we named UP-likePuI. In our previous work (26Bertoni G. Fujita N. Ishihama A. de Lorenzo V. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5120-5128Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), to explain the mechanism behind the IHF-mediated recruitment of σ54-RNAP, we suggested that the distance between the –12/–24 site and the UP element(s) might disfavor either the formation or the maintenance of simultaneous binding by σ54-RNAP through σ54 and αCTD, respectively. Thus, the key recruiting action of IHF-induced bending would have consisted of increasing σ54-RNAP affinity for Pu DNA by bringing the –12/–24 site and the UP element(s) into a closer proximity. Apparently, from the footprinting analysis presented in Fig. 2, the ability of σ54-RNAP to establish contacts with the Pu region located upstream of the IHF binding site seemed to be enhanced to a limited extent only by the addition of IHF. However, further analysis with free radical-delivering σ54-RNAPs (see below) showed more clearly that IHF-induced bending can cause increased occupancy by αCTD of the region upstream to the IHF binding site. The Integrity of the UP-like PuI Site Is Required Both for Full Promoter Affinity and IHF-mediated Recruitment of σ 54-RNAP—The footprinting experiments presented above allowed us to identify an upstream DNA element, UP-likePuI, which is contacted by σ54-RNAP in the closed complex with the Pu promoter. To evaluate the role of the contacts with UP-likePuI in determining the affinity of σ54-RNAP for the Pu promoter, we ran gel retardation assays on the nucleoprotein closed complexes formed by σ54-RNAP with DNA fragments bearing either the Pu sequence up to position –126 (Pu-126; Fig. 1) supposed to include the whole UP-likePuI site or progressively shorter Pu sequences extending up to –114, –105, and –85, respectively (Pu-114, Pu-105, Pu-85; Fig. 1). Side-by-side comparison of the amounts of complex assembled by σ54-RNAP with either Pu-126 or Pu-114, respectively, showed no significant difference (data not shown). On the contrary, the amounts of complex formed by σ54-RNAP with Pu-105 w"

In silico searches in completely sequenced archaeal genomes using known bacterial and eukaryal proteins involved in the CoA biosynthetic pathway allowed identification of archaeal homologues for only three of the five steps, PPCS, PPCD, and PPAT. Putative archaeal PPCS and PPCDC are homologous to their bacterial counterparts (a putative distantly related eukaryal PPCDC homologue was recently identified with a genomic approach, whereas no PPCS homologue could be highlighted (8Daugherty M. Polanuyer B. Farrell M. Scholle M. Lykidis A. de Crecy-Lagard V. Osterman A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21431-21439Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar)), whereas putative archaeal PPAT are only homologous to their eukaryal counterparts. Whereas it is common that archaeal proteins involved in cell division, metabolic or transport pathways (the so-called operational proteins) resemble more their bacterial counterparts, the reverse situation (an eukaryotic-like operational protein) is quite unusual. Putative archaeal PPAT are homologues to the recently characterized PPAT domains of the bifunctional eukaryotic PPAT/DPCK, involved in the last two steps of the coenzyme A biosynthetic pathway (7Zhyvoloup A. Nemazanyy I. Babich A. Panasyuk G. Pobigailo N. Vudmaska M. Naidenov V. Kukharenko O. Palchevskii S. Savinska L. Ovcharenko G. Verdier F. Valovka T. Fenton T. Rebholz H. Wang M.L. Shepherd P.

J. 2002; 365: 13-18Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We had previously characterized this archaeal protein as an interesting target for structural genomic projects (18Matte-Tailliez O. Zivanovic Y. Forterre P. Trends Genet. 2000; 16: 533-536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), and listed it as a PACE (Protein of Archaea Conserved in Eukarya) protein (PACE11), with a general nucleotidyltransferase activity in our PACE data base. 2www-archbac.u-psud.fr/projects/pace/paceproteins.html. To determine whether PACE11 is a PPAT, we have characterized this protein (PAB0944) from the hyperthermophilic archaeon Pyrococcus abyssi. Here we describe the purification of a recombinant N terminus His-tagged form of PAB0944 and its biochemical characterization. Indeed, the overexpressed product is shown to exhibit PPAT activity. This is the first biochemical identification of a specific step involved in CoA biosynthesis in Archaea, strongly suggesting that a complete CoA biosynthetic pathway is also operational in the third domain of life. Chemical, Biological, and Microbiological Reagents—Most chemicals used in this study were obtained from Sigma and were of analytical grade. Oligonucleotide primers were synthesized and HPLC purified by Genaxys. Restriction enzymes were from New England Biolabs, Ampli-Taq DNA polymerase was from Applied Biosystem. P3 medium used in a pH-regulated fermentor consisted of 4 g/liter KH2PO4, 4 g/liter K2HPO4, 7 g/liter Na2HPO4, 12H2O, 1.2 g/liter (NH4)2SO3, 0.2 g/liter NH4Cl, 25 g/liter yeast extract, 5 g/liter NZ CAZE Plus supplemented with 4 ml of trace elements solution. The latter consisted of a aqueous solution containing 10 g/liter FeSO4, 7H2O, 10 g/liter CaCl2, 2H2O, 2.5 g/liter MnSO4, H2O, 2.5 g/liter AlCl3, 6H20, 1 g/liter CoCl2, 6H2O, 0.5 g/liter ZnSO4, 7H2O, 0.5 g/liter Na2MoO4, 2H2O, 0.25 g/liter CuCl2, 2H2O, 0.125 g/liter H3BO3, and 25 ml/liter HCl. Media were supplemented when necessary with the following antibiotics: ampicillin (50 μg/ml), tetracycline (10 μg/ml), and chloramphenicol (20 μg/ml). Strains, Plasmids, and DNA Manipulation—E. coli strain DH5α (Invitrogen) was used for cloning and both E. coli strains BL21-Codonplus(DE3)-RIL (Stratagene) and Rosetta(DE3)pLysS (Novagen) were checked for protein overproduction. Vector pCR T7/NT-topo (Invitrogen) containing a T7 promoter, His6 tag, and Xpress epitope was used for cloning and expression. The usual DNA manipulations were done according to standard procedures. PCR fragments were extracted from agarose gel by means of QiaexII gel extraction kit (Qiagen) and plasmid DNA was purified with Qiawell 8 kit (Qiagen), as recommended by the supplier. Nucleotide sequencing of both DNA strands was carried out by using a Quick Start Beckman Coulter DTCS sequencing kit with double-stranded templates. Samples containing fluorescence-labeled dideoxynucleotide terminators were cleaned by ethanol precipitation and processed on a CEQ2000 XL Beckman Coulter capillary-based automated sequencer. Sequences were compiled and analyzed with the Vector NTI software package (Informax Inc). Cloning and Overexpression of PAB0944 Gene—The synthetic oligonucleotide primers oAA98 (5′-gctagcATGAAGTTCAAGAAAGTTGTC-3′) and oAA99 (5′-ggatccTTACTCTCTTTTTATTGGGTT-3′) contain engineered NheI and BamHI sites (restriction sites underlined in the primer sequences and nucleotides not present in the original sequence are shown by lowercase), respectively. They were used for PCR amplification of PAB0944 with P. abyssi total DNA as template. The 483-bp fragment obtained after amplification was electrophoretically separated on a 1.5% SeaKem GTG-agarose gel and extracted prior cloning into pCR T7/NT-topo. The resulting plasmid pSBTN-AB31 was selected for correct orientation by restriction mapping using BamHI and EcoRI restriction enzymes. As expected, the PCR fragment was shown by sequencing to be in-frame with the His tag and Xpress sequences, both located at the N terminus. Plasmid pSBTN-AB31 was subjected to digestion by NheI and ligated with T4 DNA ligase. The plasmid pSBTN-AB30 obtained after transformation with the ligation mixture resulted in suppression of the Xpress epitope. Both constructs were verified by DNA sequencing to ascertain the integrity of the nucleotide sequence. Hyperexpression of the recombinant PAB0944 construct was achieved either with E. coli BL21(DE3)Codonplus-RIL or Rosetta(DE3)pLysS strains, both freshly transformed with pSBTN-AB30. Cultures were carried out at 30 °C in LB medium in baffled flasks or P3 medium supplemented with 30 g/liter of glucose in a 4-liter Labfors fermentor (Infors). They were induced with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside when A 600nm reached 0.6 (flasks) or 2.5 (fermentor). After 3 h of induction, cells were harvested by centrifugation (4,000 × g, 20 min, 4 °C) and washed once with 50 mm Tris-HCl buffered at pH 8.0 and maintained at 4 °C. Cell pellets (typically 118 g of wet material for a 4-liter culture) obtained by a second centrifugation were frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept several days at –80 °C. Purification of Recombinant His-tagged PAB0944 Protein—The purification of recombinant PAB0944 was performed from packed cells equivalent to 4 liters of culture. Buffer A consisted of 50 mm Na2HPO4/KH2PO4 buffer (pH 7.2). The pellet was thawed on ice and resuspended in 300 ml of buffer A containing 10 mm NaCl. The cells were disrupted by sonication with a total energy delivered of 131 kJ. The cell extract was then centrifuged at 30,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C to remove cellular debris and aggregated proteins. The supernatant was subjected to a 20-min heat treatment using a water bath maintained at 60 °C, and immediately centrifuged a second time at 30,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Subsequent steps were performed at room temperature. NaCl was added to the supernatant to reach a final concentration of 100 mm. The sample was applied at a flow rate of 2.8 ml/min onto a XK 26 × 20 column (Amersham Biosciences) containing 50 ml of chelating Sepharose Fast Flow (Amersham Biosciences) and prelabely loaded with 200 mm NiSO4, washed with Milli-Q water, and equilibrated with Buffer A containing 150 mm NaCl (Buffer B) and 50 mm imidazole. The column was washed at a flow rate of 4.9 ml/min with 4 column volumes of buffer B and then developed with a 8-column volume linear gradient from 50 to 300 mm imidazole in buffer B using an Äkta Purifier 100 FPLC system (Amersham Biosciences). The His-tagged PAB0944 protein was eluted as a 310-ml fraction at ∼250 mm imidazole. The protein sample was concentrated to a volume of 30 ml by means of three Pellicon XL Ultracel-PLCCC5 (3 × 50 cm2) filtration units assembled on a Labscale TFF system (Amicon, Millipore) and then dialyzed overnight at 4 °C against Buffer A containing 50 mm NaCl and 1 mm EDTA. The purified protein was stored at –80 °C at a concentration of 1.0 mg/ml. Eventually, a second chromatography step was carried out. The sample was melted and dialyzed overnight at 4 °C against 20 mm KH2PO4/Na2HPO4 buffered at pH 7.2 (Buffer C). The supernatant obtained after centrifugation at 30,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C was applied onto a 6-ml Resource-S ion exchange column (30 × 16 mm, 15 μm) from Amersham Biosciences, previously equilibrated with buffer C and operated at a flow rate of 3 ml/min. After a 10-column volume wash with Buffer C, proteins were resolved with a 20-column volume linear gradient from 0 to 500 mm NaCl in Buffer C. Recombinant PAB0944 was eluted at ∼400 mm NaCl and desalted by overnight dialysis against Buffer A containing 50 mm NaCl and 1 mm EDTA. When necessary, the purified protein was concentrated on a Centriplus YM3 or microcon YM3 filtration units (Amicon, Millipore). Buffer exchange was performed either by dialysis or by gel filtration by means of Micro Bio-Spin P-30 chromatography columns (Bio-Rad). Biochemical Analytical Methods—Protein concentration was determined either by the Bradford method using the Bio-Rad Protein Assay (Bio-Rad) and bovine serum albumin as standard or by measuring the absorbance at 280 nm. Molar absorption coefficients of 28,000 and 18,000 m–1 cm–1 were estimated at 265 (λmax) and 280 nm, respectively, from UV-visible spectra after determination of protein concentration by total amino acid analysis. The samples were dried and then hydrolyzed at 110 °C in constant boiling HCl containing 1% (v/v) phenol, for 24 h under reduced pressure. Amino acids were analyzed on a Beckman amino acid analyzer model 6300, with the standard sodium citrate eluting buffer system. The analyzer was calibrated using a standard solution of amino acids between 500 and 5000 pmol. N-terminal amino acid sequencing was performed by Edman degradation on 7 pmol of recombinant His-tagged PAB0944 by means of a Procise protein sequencing system (Applied Biosystems) coupled with a 140C microgradient pump system (Applied Biosystems) and a Series 200 UV-visible detector (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). UV-visible absorption spectra were acquired on a Cary 50 scan UV-visible spectrophotometer (Varian) operated at 25 °C. Circular Dichroism and Secondary Structure Prediction—Circular dichroism spectra were recorded at 25 °C between 190 and 250 nm on a Jobin-Yvon CD6 spectro-dichrograph, using a quartz cuvette of 1-mm path length, with a 2-s integration time for each 0.5-nm step and a bandwidth of 2 nm. Two spectra of purified His-tagged PAB0944 at 7 μm in 2 mm KH2PO4/Na2HPO4 buffer (pH 7.2) containing 2 mm NaCl were averaged and corrected from the baseline for buffer solvents. Spectra were analyzed using the program K2D 3www.embl-heidelberg.de/~andrade/k2d. described by Andrade et al. (19Andrade M.A. Chacon P. Merelo J.J. Moran F. Protein Eng. 1993; 6: 383-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (949) Google Scholar). Secondary structure predictions were obtained through the PSIpred v2.4 web-interfaced facilities 4bioinf.cs.ucl.ac.uk/psipred. described by McGuffin et al. (20McGuffin L.J. Bryson K. Jones D.T. Bioinformatics. 2000; 16: 404-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (2741) Google Scholar) or through the IBPC consensus program. 5npsa-pbil.ibcp.fr. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy—Unlabeled PAB0944 sample was prepared at a concentration of 0.1 mm in a 10 mm KH2PO4/Na2HPO4 buffer (pH 7.2), and 10% D2O. The sample was degassed, argon-saturated, and sealed before analysis. One-dimensional NMR spectra were recorded at various temperatures between 25 and 55 °Con a Varian Inova 400 MHz spectrometer equipped with a triple-resonance (1H, 13C, 15N) probe including shielded z-gradients. Spectra were treated with the Felix97 software (Accelrys). Determination of Native Molecular Mass by Gel Filtration—The native molecular mass of His-tagged PAB0944 was estimated by gel filtration chromatography on a Superdex 75 gel packed into a HR10/30 column (Amersham Biosciences) with a final bed volume of 23 ml. The column was equilibrated at room temperature at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min with 50 mm Tris/HCl buffer (pH 8.0), containing 400 mm potassium glutamate and eluted with the same buffer. Protein standards used to calibrate the column were ribonuclease A (15.8 kDa), chymotrypsinogen A (21.2 kDa), ovalbumin (49.4 kDa), and albumin (69.8 kDa), all from Amersham Biosciences. Exclusion limit was evaluated with dextran blue 2000 (Amersham Biosciences). Samples consisting of 350 μl of PAB0944 at 0.285 and 0.855 mg/ml were injected. Specific absorption at 280 and 266 nm were followed and the ratio A 280nm/A 266nm was found consistent with the elution of the major peak being PAB0944 in the two runs. Mass Spectrometry—Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry was carried out with a Biflex IV instrument (Brüker Daltonik). Protein samples were applied to the target using sinapinic acid prepared as saturated solution in 30% acetonitrile, 70% Milli-Q water, and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid as matrix. Mass spectra were recorded in the positive ion mode from ∼250 laser flashes. The instrument was calibrated for determination of entire protein masses using either a mixture of chymotrypsin and bovine serum albumin, or apomyoglobin and aldolase. The calibrants were mixed with the samples (internal calibration) or used separately (external calibration). Tryptic digested samples were desalted by means of a ZipTipC18 pipette tip (Millipore) according to the protocol specified by the manufacturer. Tryptic samples were then mixed directly onto the target with an equal volume of a saturated solution of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid in 30% acetonitrile containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. In this case, the instrument was externally calibrated using a pepmix calibration kit (Brüker Daltonik) and then, internally calibrated using some of the theoretical peptide masses. Spectra were evaluated with the BioTools package (Brüker Daltonik) and identification of PAB0944 was done using the MASCOT search engine (Matrix Science). Differential Scanning Calorimetry—To determine the transition temperature T m of His-tagged PAB0944, microcalorimetry measurements were carried out with a high-sensitivity differential scanning microcalorimeter VP-DSC from MicroCal. Prior to the calorimetric analysis, the samples were diluted into the reference buffers used in the experiment (10 mm KH2PO4/Na2HPO4 buffer (pH 7.2), containing 1 mm EDTA and 10 mm NaCl or 50 mm Tris/HCl buffer (pH 8.0), containing 400 mm potassium glutamate), and then degassed. Recombinant His6-tagged PAB0944 was analyzed at a protein concentration comprised between 45 and 70 μm as determined by spectrophotometry. The calorimetric scans were carried out between 40 and 85 °C with a heating scan rate of 50 K/h in 0.51 ml of cells, against the reference buffer. HPLC Analysis—Samples were analyzed using an Agilent 1100 Series reverse-phase HPLC system equipped with G1315B diode array detector, G1322A degasser and G1311A quaternary pump, G1329A autosampler, and sample cooler unit operated at 4 °C. The different components from the enzymatic reaction were resolved on a Supelcosil LC-18 column (50 × 4.6 mm, 5 μm) from Supelco protected by a pre-column filter and a Supelguard LC-18 guard column (20 × 4.6 mm, 5 μm). Isocratic separation was performed with a filtered aqueous solvent system containing 90 mm NaH2PO4/Na2HPO4 buffer (pH 5.5), 7.2 mm tetrabutylammonium bromide, and 10% acetonitrile at a flow rate of 1.5 ml/min as described by Daugherty et al. (8Daugherty M. Polanuyer B. Farrell M. Scholle M. Lykidis A. de Crecy-Lagard V. Osterman A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21431-21439Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Dithiothreitol was added to cooled samples to reach a final concentration of 1 mm and 40 μl of sample were analyzed. Absorbance was monitored between 190 and 500 nm with the diode array detector. Identities of ATP, dPCoA, CoA, and 4′-phosphopantetheine were confirmed by comparison of elution time and UV spectrum with those of authentic standards. Molar areas were determined using a calibration with these standards in the same chromatographic conditions. Enzyme Assays—The reverse PPAT reaction assay was first assessed at 25 °C by coupling the release of ATP to the reduction of NADP to NADPH and detection at 340 nm as described previously (21Worrall D.M. Tubbs P.K. Biochem. J. 1983; 215: 153-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). dPCoA was incubated at a concentration of 200 μm with 2 mm PPi, 5 mm glucose, 1 mm NADP, 2 units of hexokinase, 1 unit of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, 2 mm MgCl2, and 1.7 μg/ml purified His-tagged PAB0944 in 50 mm Tris/HCl buffer (pH 8.0). Change in absorbance at 340 nm was monitored over 5 min. To follow the enzymatic activity at higher temperature and with various conditions of substrates and buffers, samples were prepared into thin-wall 0.2-ml tubes and were incubated in a Tgradient thermocycler (Biometra) operated with a 110 °C pre-heated lid to avoid any solvent evaporation and thus, undesired variation of product concentration. In this case, dPCoA was incubated at a concentration of 5–500 μm with 2 mm PPi, 2 mm MgCl2, and variable amounts (typically 1.7 μg/ml) of purified His-tagged PAB0944 in 50 mm Tris/HCl buffer (pH 8.0, 25 °C) containing 400 mm potassium glutamate. After reaction, samples were immediately cooled in an ice-melting water bath and kept at 4 °C until HPLC analyzed. The components of the enzyme assays were resolved by direct HPLC analysis, monitoring at 255 nm formation of ATP, and concomitant consumption of dPCoA. The forward phosphopantetheine adenylyltransferase activity assay was verified by detecting the release of dPCoA. Briefly, 1 mm 4′-phosphopantetheine was incubated with 0.1 mm ATP, 4 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm MgCl2 and various amount of purified His-tagged PAB0944 in 50 mm Tris/HCl buffer (pH 8.0) containing 400 mm potassium glutamate. Samples were treated as above and products from the reaction were resolved by reverse-phase chromatography as described above. Small Angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS)—The SAXS experiments were carried out using the high brilliance beamline ID2 at the European Radiation Synchrotron Facility in Grenoble, France (22Nayaraman T. Diat O. Bösecke P. Nucl. Instr. 2001; 467: 1005-1009Crossref Scopus (282) Google Scholar). The experiments in solution were performed at 20 °C using the ID2 flow-through cell (2 mm-diameter and 10 μm-thickness quartz capillary, from GLAS) operated under vacuum that could be filled and rinsed in situ. The sample volume was 40 μl and the sample concentration was either 75 or 86 μm for His-tagged PAB0944 in 50 mm Tris/HCl buffer (pH 8.0), with and without 400 mm potassium glutamate, respectively. Data were collected using a two-dimensional detector (x-ray Image Intensifier coupled to an ESRF-developed FReLoN CCD camera, 1024 × 1024 pixels 2 × 2 binned). The sample to detector distances were 2.5 and 1 m, yielding a q-increment per channel of 0.004168 and 0.010082 nm–1, respectively. The amplitude of the scattering vector s is defined as Q = 2π s = 4π sinθ/λ, where λ is the wavelength of the X-rays and 2θ is the scattering angle. With λ = 0.0995 nm, the total useful Q range was 0.08544 <Q< 6.5 nm–1. The exposure time was 100 or 500 ms (3 to 10 frames for the protein, 10 to 20 frames for the buffer with 5 s pause between each frame). After the two-dimensional data reduction, the curves were averaged when no radiation damage or bubbles were observed. Putative Function of PAB0944 and Purification of the His-tagged Recombinant Form—Recently, the human PPAT protein domain was identified from its association with a DPCK domain and on biochemical evidence (7Zhyvoloup A. Nemazanyy I. Babich A. Panasyuk G. Pobigailo N. Vudmaska M. Naidenov V. Kukharenko O. Palchevskii S. Savinska L. Ovcharenko G. Verdier F. Valovka T. Fenton T. Rebholz H. Wang M.L. Shepherd P.

J. 2002; 365: 13-18Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This PPAT domain is universally present in Eukarya and it is homologous to putative archaeal nucleotidyltransferases (PACE 11), whereas it harbors no homologues in Bacteria. To determine whether these archaeal homologues are indeed PPAT, the corresponding protein from P. abyssi (PAB0944) was produced as an N-terminal His-tagged recombinant form. An E. coli T7-based overexpression system was constructed using for PAB0944 as first codon the most probable ATG located at 1380906 (numbering referred to whole P. abyssi genomic sequence). Apparently, genome annotators have considered that the upstream TTG codon was encoding the initial methionine. However, TTG codons are used as initiators only in a few open reading frames. Moreover, the two initial methionines are not conserved in archaeal homologues, and at least in E. coli, the first formylmethionine would probably be processed by the methionine-aminopeptidase leaving only one of the two residues. For these reasons, the N terminus sequence of PAB0944 would be rather Met-Lys-Phe- than Met-Met-Lys-Phe-. Therefore, the His tag construct was based on the former sequence. The P. abyssi chromosomal gene comprises a particularly high rate of E. coli rare codons: 32 over a sequence of 156 amino acids (21%) and three tandem rare codon triple repe"
https://openalex.org/W2051726960,"E2F regulation is essential for normal cell cycle progression. Therefore, it is not surprising that squamous cell carcinoma cell lines (SCC) overexpress E2F1 and exhibit deregulated E2F activity when compared with normal keratinocytes. Indeed, deliberate E2F1 deregulation has been shown to induce hyperplasia and skin tumor formation. In this study, we report on a dual role for E2F as a mediator of keratinocyte proliferation and modulator of squamous differentiation. Overexpression of E2F isoforms in confluent primary keratinocyte cultures resulted in suppression of differentiation-associated markers. Moreover, we found that the DNA binding domain and the trans-activation domain of E2F1 are important in mediating suppression of differentiation. Use of a dominant/negative form of E2F1 (E2F d/n) found that E2F inhibition alone is sufficient to suppress the activity of proliferation-associated markers but is not capable of inducing differentiation markers. However, if the E2F d/n is expressed in differentiated keratinocytes, differentiation marker activity is further induced, suggesting that E2F may act as a modulator of squamous differentiation. We therefore examined the effects of E2F d/n in a differentiation-insensitive SCC cell line. We found that treatment with the differentiating agent, 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate (TPA), or expression of E2F d/n alone had no effect on differentiation markers. However, a combination of E2F d/n + TPA induced the expression of differentiation markers. Combined, these data indicate that E2F may play a key role in keratinocyte differentiation. These data also illustrate the unique potential of anti-E2F therapies in arresting proliferation and inducing differentiation of SCCs. E2F regulation is essential for normal cell cycle progression. Therefore, it is not surprising that squamous cell carcinoma cell lines (SCC) overexpress E2F1 and exhibit deregulated E2F activity when compared with normal keratinocytes. Indeed, deliberate E2F1 deregulation has been shown to induce hyperplasia and skin tumor formation. In this study, we report on a dual role for E2F as a mediator of keratinocyte proliferation and modulator of squamous differentiation. Overexpression of E2F isoforms in confluent primary keratinocyte cultures resulted in suppression of differentiation-associated markers. Moreover, we found that the DNA binding domain and the trans-activation domain of E2F1 are important in mediating suppression of differentiation. Use of a dominant/negative form of E2F1 (E2F d/n) found that E2F inhibition alone is sufficient to suppress the activity of proliferation-associated markers but is not capable of inducing differentiation markers. However, if the E2F d/n is expressed in differentiated keratinocytes, differentiation marker activity is further induced, suggesting that E2F may act as a modulator of squamous differentiation. We therefore examined the effects of E2F d/n in a differentiation-insensitive SCC cell line. We found that treatment with the differentiating agent, 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate (TPA), or expression of E2F d/n alone had no effect on differentiation markers. However, a combination of E2F d/n + TPA induced the expression of differentiation markers. Combined, these data indicate that E2F may play a key role in keratinocyte differentiation. These data also illustrate the unique potential of anti-E2F therapies in arresting proliferation and inducing differentiation of SCCs. The major function of the skin is to act as a barrier between the internal and external environment. The skin is divided into two layers, the dermis and the epidermis, of which the major cell type in the epidermis is the keratinocyte. During the strictly regulated process of differentiation, keratinocytes undergo morphological and biochemical changes, resulting in dead, enucleated, flat cells that are eventually sloughed from the skin surface. This process of differentiation is initiated by the irreversible growth arrest and suppression of proliferation-specific genes such as p53 (1Woodworth C.D. Wang H. Simpson S. Alvarez-Salas L.M. Notario V. Cell Growth Differ. 1993; 4: 367-376PubMed Google Scholar), E2F1 (2Saunders N.A. Jetten A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2016-2022Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Jones S.J.

Concomitant with the suppression of proliferation-specific genes, there is a corresponding induction of differentiation-specific genes, such as keratin 10 (6Rieger M. Franke W.W. J. Mol.

Chem. 1994; 269: 2016-2022Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This process of growth suppression and induction of terminal differentiation is predominantly regulated at the transcriptional level by several transcription factor families such as AP1, Sp1, AP2, and E2F (8Eckert R.L.

E2F exists as a heterodimeric complex in association with a dimeric partner protein, DP1 or DP2 (25Girling R. Partridge J.F. Bandara L.R. Burden N. Totty N.F. Hsuan J.J. La Thangue N.B.

This “free” E2F complex acts as a potent trans-activator of E2F-responsive genes. However, the activity of E2F is subject to regulation through inhibitory interactions with hypophosphorylated forms of the pocket proteins, pRb, p107, and p130 (13Shan B. Zhu X. Chen P.L. Durfee T.

Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1850-1861Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). Specifically, E2Fs 1–3 preferentially bind to pRb, while E2Fs 4–5 bind p107 and E2F5 binds p130. This direct association of E2F isoforms with their cognate pocket protein partner acts to repress E2F-mediated transcriptional activity. In some instances, this repression requires further interactions with specific histone deacetylases (29Saunders N.A. Popa C. Serewko M.M. Jones S.J. Dicker A.J. Dahler A.L. Expert Opin. Investig. Drugs. 1999; 8: 1611-1621Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 30Ferreira R. Magnaghi-Jaulin L. Robin P. Harel-Bellan A. Trouche D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10493-10498Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). The presence of these various E2F-pocket protein complexes act to regulate passage through various phases of the cell cycle. In particular, certain complexes are associated with a specific phase of the cell cycle: the E2F5·p130 complex associates with G0 (31Cobrinik D. Whyte P. Peeper D.S. Jacks T. Weinberg R.A. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2392-2404Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar), E2F1–3·pRb with G1 (32Weintraub S.J. Prater C.A. Dean D.C. Nature. 1992; 358: 259-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar) and E2F4·p107 with G0/G1 phase (18Ginsberg D. Vairo G. Chittenden T. Xiao Z.X. Xu G. Wydner K.L. DeCaprio J.A. Lawrence J.B. Livingston D.M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2665-2679Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Thus, the coordinated activation/inactivation of these complexes illustrate that cell cycle progression is controlled by complex transcriptional means. Despite clear evidence implicating E2F involvement in cell cycle regulation, there is also compelling evidence for other roles of E2F. For instance, E2Fs 1–3 have been implicated in the initiation of apoptosis (33Bates S. Phillips A.C. Clark P.A. Stott F. Peters G. Ludwig R.L. Vousden K.H.

More recently, E2Fs have also been demonstrated to play a role in the regulation of myocyte, megakaryocyte, and adipocyte differentiation (37Wang J. Helin K. Jin P. Nadal-Ginard B. Cell Growth Differ. 1995; 6: 1299-1306PubMed Google Scholar, 38Guy C.T. Zhou W. Kaufman S. Robinson M.O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 685-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 39Fajas L. Landsberg R.L. Huss-Garcia Y. Sardet C. Lees J.A. Auwerx J. Dev Cell. 2002; 3: 39-49Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). We have previously reported that the induction of keratinocyte growth arrest, in response to growth inhibitors, is associated with decreased E2F1 mRNA expression (2Saunders N.A. Jetten A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2016-2022Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Jones S.J. Dicker A.J. Dahler A.L. Saunders N.A. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1997; 109: 187-193Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and decreased E2F DNA binding activity (3Jones S.J. Dicker A.J. Dahler A.L. Saunders N.A. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1997; 109: 187-193Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In contrast, squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) 1The abbreviations used are: SCC, squamous cell carcinoma cell lines; HEK, human epidermal keratinocytes; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; GFP, green fluorescent protein; TPA, 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. cell lines showed no alterations in E2F DNA binding activity nor E2F1 mRNA expression in response to these same growth inhibitors (3Jones S.J. Dicker A.J. Dahler A.L. Saunders N.A. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1997; 109: 187-193Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Given the role of E2F in proliferation, we proposed that the deregulation of E2F activity may contribute causally to the deregulated growth observed in SCC cell lines (3Jones S.J. Dicker A.J. Dahler A.L. Saunders N.A. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1997; 109: 187-193Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Indeed, several lines of evidence support this contention. For example, deliberate deregulation of E2F activity in vitro using HPV 16 E7 protein resulted in growth inhibitor-insensitivity in normal keratinocytes (3Jones S.J. Dicker A.J. Dahler A.L. Saunders N.A. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1997; 109: 187-193Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). These data are further strengthened by more recent reports that E2F1 mRNA overexpression occurs in primary SCCs compared with normal epidermis (10Dicker A.J. Popa C. Dahler A.L. Serewko M.M. Hilditch-Maguire P.A. Frazer I.H. Saunders N.A. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2887-2894Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Furthermore, deliberate deregulation of E2F1 expression in the skin of transgenic mice induces hyperplasia and cooperates with ras in skin tumor development (40Pierce A.M. Fisher S.M. Conti C.J. Johnson D.G. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1267-1276Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Combined, these data suggested that the deregulation of E2F1 could contribute to skin cancer formation. While the overexpression and activation of E2F in human SCCs may contribute to their deregulated proliferation, we became interested in whether this overexpression would have other implications on the squamous differentiation program. To this end, we found some evidence that E2F1 may have a dual role as both a mediator of keratinocyte proliferation and a suppressor of squamous differentiation (10Dicker A.J. Popa C. Dahler A.L. Serewko M.M. Hilditch-Maguire P.A. Frazer I.H. Saunders N.A. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2887-2894Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). If this were true, it would suggest that deregulated E2F in SCCs may serve to deregulate proliferation and repress terminal differentiation. Therefore, in the present study, we examined the possibility that E2F may act as a biologically relevant modulator of squamous differentiation and that E2F inhibition may provide the basis of a “differentiation therapy” for SCCs. Cell Culture—Human epidermal keratinocytes (HEKs) were isolated and cultured from neonatal foreskins as described (3Jones S.J. Dicker A.J. Dahler A.L. Saunders N.A. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1997; 109: 187-193Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The SCC cell line, KJD-1/SV40, were grown in culture as previously reported (10Dicker A.J. Popa C. Dahler A.L. Serewko M.M. Hilditch-Maguire P.A. Frazer I.H. Saunders N.A. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2887-2894Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Growth arrest and differentiation was induced by maintaining confluent cells in culture over 48 h or by treatment with the protein kinase C (PKC) activator, 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate (TPA, 50 ng/ml for 16–48 h). Both these treatment regimes induce robust and reproducible differentiation in HEKs but not in SCC cell lines (10Dicker A.J. Popa C. Dahler A.L. Serewko M.M. Hilditch-Maguire P.A. Frazer I.H.

The implications of E2F1 overexpression in normal keratinocytes were therefore examined by measuring differentiation-specific marker activity in cells induced to differentiate by two independent pathways (confluence or PKC activation, Refs. 41Saunders N.A.

Our data demonstrate that cultured HEKs have increased TG-1 Luc and K10-Luc activity when induced to differentiate either by prior treatment of cells with TPA or by growth to confluence for 48 h (Fig. 1). Transfection of E2F1 into these differentiated cells was accompanied by significant reduction in activity of these differentiation-specific markers. This observation indicates that E2F1 can suppress differentiation-specific reporters in keratinocytes induced to differentiate by two different stimuli. In addition, co-transfection of E2Fs 1–5 and the TG-1 Luc reporter into differentiated keratinocytes showed that E2Fs 1–5 were all able to significantly suppress TG-1 Luc activity in confluent/differentiated HEKs (Fig. 2). This indicates that the ability to suppress differentiation markers is shared by E2Fs 1–5. Since E2Fs 4–5 do not contain a cyclin binding domain (18Ginsberg D. Vairo G. Chittenden T. Xiao Z.X. Xu G.

The DNA Binding Domain and trans-Activation Domain of E2F1 Is Essential for Suppression of Differentiation-specific Marker Activity—To examine the domain requirement of E2F1 to suppress squamous differentiation, we employed two E2F1 mutants (Fig. 3). The Δ132E2F1 mutant contains a point mutation in the DNA binding domain, which abolishes its activity (47Johnson D.G. Schwarz J.K. Cress W.D. Nevins J.R. Nature. 1993; 365: 349-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar). Similarly, the Δ409E2F1 mutant possesses a frameshift mutation that eliminates both the trans-activation domain and pocket protein binding domain of E2F1 (47Johnson D.G. Schwarz J.K. Cress W.D. Nevins J.R. Nature. 1993; 365: 349-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar). Both the DNA binding domain mutant (Δ132E2F1) and trans-activation domain mutant (Δ409E2F1) are unable to induce the proliferation-specific and E2F-responsive cdc2-CAT reporter (Fig. 3A). Furthermore, by measuring TG-1 promoter activity, we show that both mutants are unable to suppress TG-1 Luc activity in differentiated keratinocytes (Fig. 3B). These data demonstrate that both the DNA binding domain of E2F1 and the trans-activation domain of E2F1 are important for the suppression of differentiation-specific markers in HEKs. These data also suggest that suppression of differentiation is unlikely to be mediated by “squelching.” It is interesting to note that E2Fd/n was able to superinduce/derepress TG-1 Luc activity to levels above that of differentiated HEKs. Thus, E2F1 overexpression suppresses TG-1 Luc and E2F inhibition induces TG-1 Luc. These data are consistent with a role for E2F as a modulator of squamous differentiation. E2F Is Required For but Not Sufficient to Induce Squamous Differentiation—Given that the E2Fd/n could further induce TG-1 Luc activity in confluent cells, we examined the possibility that in proliferative cells the induction of differentiation was actively suppressed by E2F. If this were true, then inhibition of E2F in proliferative cells should suppress proliferation markers and induce differentiation markers. Indeed, inhibition of E2F causes suppression of the proliferation-specific marker activity, cdc2-CAT (Fig. 4A). However, inhibition of E2F is not sufficient to induce TG-1 Luc activity (Fig. 4B). Paradoxically, inhibition of E2F in confluent/differentiated HEKs superinduces/derepresses both TG-1 Luc"
https://openalex.org/W1973552252,"Platelet-activating factor (PAF) is a phospholipid with potent and diverse physiological actions, particularly as a mediator of inflammation. We have reported previously that mutant G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) affect the functional properties of coexpressed wild-type human PAF receptor (hPAFR) (Le Gouill, C., Parent, J. L., Caron, C. A., Gaudreau, R., Volkov, L., Rola-Pleszczynski, M., and Stankova, J. (1999) J. Biol. Chem. 274, 12548–12554). Increasing evidence suggests that dimerization of GPCRs may play an important role in the regulation of their biological activity. Additional data have also suggested that dimerization may be important in the subsequent internalization of the δ-opioid receptor. To investigate the specific role of dimerization in the internalization process of GPCRs, we generated a fusion protein of hPAFR and bacterial DNA gyrase B (GyrB), dimerized through the addition of coumermycin. We found that dimerization potentiates PAF-induced internalization of hPAFR-GyrB in Chinese hamster ovary cells stably expressing c-Myc-hPAFR-GyrB. Coumermycin-driven dimerization was also sufficient to induce an agonist-independent sequestration process in an arrestin- and clathrin-independent manner. Moreover, the protein kinase C inhibitors staurosporine and GF109203X blocked the coumermycin-induced desensitization of hPAFR-GyrB, suggesting the implication of protein kinase C in the molecular mechanism mediating the agonist-independent desensitization of the receptor. Taken together, these findings suggest a novel mechanism of GPCR desensitization and internalization triggered by dimerization.

Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 691-702Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PAF is thought to be a mediator of cell-to-cell communication, which may function either as an intercellular or an intracellular messenger (3Chao W. Olson M.S. Biochem. J. 1993; 292: 617-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). Its presence has been associated with a number of inflammatory and allergic responses that may result in pathologic events that affect the cardiovascular, cerebral, respiratory, gastrointestinal, and pancreatic systems, as well as transplanted tissues (4Evangelou A.M. Prostaglandins Leukotrienes Essent. Fatty Acids. 1994; 50: 1-28Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 5Imaizumi T.A. Stafforini D.M. Yamada Y. McIntyre T.M. Prescott S.M. Zimmerman G.A. J. Intern. Med. 1995; 238: 5-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). PAF drives its biological activity through a single type of GPCR, referred to as the PAF receptor (PAFR) (6Izumi T. Shimizu T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1259: 317-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Upon binding to its receptor, PAF stimulates a number of transduction pathways including turnover of phosphatidylinositol, elevation in intracellular calcium concentration, and activation of protein kinases. The former involves protein kinase C (PKC), protein-tyrosine kinases, and G protein receptor kinase (7Ali H. Richardson R.M. Tomhave E.D. DuBose R.A. Haribabu B. Snyderman R. J. Biol.

Previous studies have shown that the human (h)PAFR undergoes a ligand-specific and clathrin-dependent internalization in transfected cells (10Ishii I. Saito E. Izumi T. Ui M. Shimizu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9878-9885Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 11Chen Z. Dupre D J. Le Gouill C. Rola-Pleszczynski M. Stankova J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7356-7362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). However, we have reported that G protein coupling and signal transduction are not necessary for hPAFR internalization (12Le Gouill C. Parent J.L. Rola-Pleszczynski M. Stankova J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21289-21295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar).Exposure of GPCRs to their agonists is usually followed by a rapid desensitization of signaling (13Bunemann M. Hosey M.M. J. Physiol. 1999; 517: 5-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 14Ferguson S.S. Pharmacol. Rev. 2001; 53: 1-24PubMed Google Scholar, 15Tsao P. von Zastrow M. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2000; 10: 365-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). A series of distinct events is known to participate in this mechanism, including a functional uncoupling of the receptor from its cognate G protein, sequestration of the receptors into intracellular compartments, and a net loss of receptors (down-regulation). GPCR internalization has become the subject of intensive investigation over the past several years, and a large volume of data has accumulated regarding the mechanisms regulating their endocytosis.

There are exceptions to this generalization, however, because some receptors such the dopamine D2 receptor, the angiotensin 1A receptor, and the m2 muscarinic receptor can internalize by an unidentified mechanism that shows an atypical sensitivity to dynamin (18Vickery R.G. von Zastrow M.

In addition, further analysis revealed that the N-formyl peptide receptor and the C5a chemoattractant receptor are internalized via an arrestin- and dynamin-independent pathway, which leads to questions about an alternative mechanism involved in mediating internalization of these receptors (22Gilbert T.L.

Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 3467-3475Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar).An increasing number of studies have shown that many GPCRs form homodimers as well as heterodimers (23Bouvier M. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 274-286Crossref Scopus (578) Google Scholar). Subsequent reports demonstrated homodimerization among the β2-adrenergic receptor (24Hebert T.E. Moffett S. Morello J.P. Loisel T.P.

Agonists have also been shown to stabilize the dimeric form of several receptors including the β2-adrenergic receptor (24Hebert T.E. Moffett S. Morello J.P. Loisel T.P. Bichet D.G. Barret C. Bouvier M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16384-16392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar) as well as the chemokine receptors CCR2b, CCR4, and CCR5 (26Rodriguez-Frade J.M.

This suggests that homodimerization might play a role either directly in the activation mechanism of receptors or in subsequent agonist-dependent internalization as shown for the δ-opioid receptor (25Cvejic S. Devi L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26959-26964Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar).We have demonstrated previously that coexpression of certain mutant hPAFR receptors with wild-type hPAFR modified specific characteristics of the native receptor, such as basal level of activity, affinity for the ligand, and cell surface expression (30Le Gouill C. Parent J.L. Caron C.A. Gaudreau R. Volkov L. Rola-Pleszczynski M. Stankova J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12548-12554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). To determine whether artificially induced oligomerization of hPAFR could modulate the internalization process of the receptor, we applied the coumermycin-induced dimerization system (31Farrar M.A. Alberola-Ila J. Perlmutter R.M. Nature. 1996; 383: 178-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar), which is based on the binding of coumermycin to the amino-terminal 24-kDa subdomain of the B subunit of bacterial DNA gyrase (GyrB) (32Gilbert E.J. Maxwell A. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 12: 365-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). A hPAFR-GyrB fusion protein was thus generated, with the GyrB moiety fused to the COOH-terminal tail of hPAFR. We report here that coumermycin treatment on CHO cells stably expressing c-Myc-hPAFR-GyrB led to the formation of dimers/oligomers, which is sufficient to induce the sequestration process by an unknown endocytic machinery. This coumermycin-driven desensitization of hPAFR-GyrB is regulated by PKC as well as a tyrosine kinase- and phospholipase C-independent mechanism. More broadly, these data suggest that signals determined by secondary structure/conformation of the receptor involved in the conversion between the monomeric and the dimeric form of GPCRs may be implicated in the heterologous desensitization process, which may be correlated with the receptor susceptibility to phosphorylation by second messenger-dependent kinases.MATERIALS AND METHODSChemical Reagents—Oligonucleotides, cell culture media, and LipofectAMINE were purchased from Invitrogen. Restriction endonucleases and T4 DNA ligase were from Promega and Amersham Biosciences. The hPAFR cDNA was a generous gift form Dr. R. Ye (University of Chicago), and pcDNA3-Raf-GyrB was kindly provided by Dr. Michael A. Farrar (Merck Research Laboratories, Rahway, NJ). Bovine serum albumin (BSA), tyrphostin 51, paraformaldehyde, coumermycin, and novobiocin were from Sigma. Staurosporine and GF109203X were from BIOMOL Research Laboratories.

Antibodies (Abs) used were rabbit polyclonal anti-c-Myc (A-14) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), monoclonal anti-c-Myc (9E10) (ATCC, Manassas, VA), and monoclonal anti-hemagglutinin (HA) (12CA5) (BAbCO, Richmond, CA). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse and donkey anti-rabbit Abs were from Amersham Biosciences. Fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse and rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-mouse Abs were obtained from Bio/Can Scientific (Mississauga, ON, Canada).Construction of Epitope-tagged PAFR-GyrB—Human PAF receptor was epitope tagged in the amino-terminal extracellular domain with either a c-Myc or a HA epitope, as described previously (12Le Gouill C. Parent J.L. Rola-Pleszczynski M. Stankova J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21289-21295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and subcloned into the pcDNA3 vector. To construct PAFR-GyrB, NheI, NotI, and ApaI sites were introduced in the pcDNA3-c-Myc-hPAFR by digestion using the oligonucleotides 5′-CTGGCAATTCCCTCAAAAATGCTAGCTAGGCGGCCGCGGGC-3′ corresponding to the last 23 nucleic acids of the hPAFR. The stop codon was then replaced at the NheI-NotI sites with the coding region of GyrB isolated from pcDNA3-Raf-GyrB at XbaI and NotI sites. Constructs were verified by restriction enzyme digestion.Cell Culture and Transfections—COS-7 and CHO cells were maintained at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (high glucose) and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium F-12 (Ham's medium, high glucose), respectively, supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum. Cells were grown in 100-mm dishes to 70–80% confluence and transiently transfected the following day with 7 ml of a mixture of 100 μm chloroquine and 0.25 mg/ml DEAE-dextran containing 4 μg of plasmid DNA (pcDNA3-c-Myc-hPAFR, pcDNA3-HA-hPAFR, or pcDNA3-c-Myc-hPAFR-GyrB) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 5% fetal bovine serum. After 2 h at 37 °C, the solution was removed, and the cells were treated for 1 min at room temperature with 10% dimethyl sulfoxide in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), rinsed twice with PBS, and returned to the 37 °C incubator in growth medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum. For confocal microscopy experiments, cells were seeded into 6-well plates (1–1.5 × 105 cells/ml) and transiently transfected with 1 μg of plasmid DNA/well by using the FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Stable CHO transfectants expressing the pcDNA3-c-Myc-hPAFR were generated as described previously (33Parent J.L. Gouill C.L. Escher E. Rola-Pleszczynski M. Stankova J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23298-23303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). CHO stably transfected with the pcDNA3-c-Myc-hPAFR-GyrB were established as above except that positive cells were selected with a FACS-Vantage cell sorter (BD Biosciences) after labeling with anti-c- Myc monoclonal antibody and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse Ab.Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—COS-7 were rinsed 48 h after transfection with PBS. Cells were then removed from 100-mm plates and collected by centrifugation in PBS. The cell pellet from each plate was disrupted in 500 μl of radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 1% IGEPAL, 0.5% deoxycholic acid, 0.1% SDS) containing protease inhibitors (1 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitors, 1 μm leupeptin, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 40 μg/ml prefabloc, and 40 μg/ml 1-chloro-3-tosylamido-7-amino-2-heptanone) and incubated 30 min on ice. Lysates were then precleared with 25 μg of protein A-Sepharose for 30 min at 4 °C and incubated with anti-HA or anti-c-Myc Ab overnight at 4 °C. The protein A-Sepharose was shaken gently in lysis buffer containing 1% BSA for 30 min at room temperature before use. Epitope-tagged hPAFRs were precipitated by incubation with 100 μg of protein A-Sepharose for 2 h at 4 °C. After washing three times in lysis buffer, complexes were dissolved in 1 × Laemmli sample buffer (34Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206024) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitated proteins were then separated by 10% Tris-glycine precast gels (Invitrogen) and transferred electrophoretically to nitrocellulose membranes. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)-stimulated cells (80 nm for 0, 30, 60, and 90 min) were lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer, and immunoprecipitation was performed as described above. For coumarin experiments, CHO cells stably expressing c-Myc epitope-tagged hPAFR-GyrB and nontransfected cells were resuspended in ice-cold buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 1 mm EDTA. The cells were then disrupted by sonication and pelleted by centrifuging at 12,500 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were collected as total cell lysates, and protein concentration was determined by the Bio-Rad procedure with BSA as standard. Samples containing 20 μg of protein were resolved using 6% Tris-glycine precast gels under nonreducing conditions. For Western blotting analysis, nitrocellulose membranes were blocked in PBS and 0.1% Tween containing 10% dried milk for 1 h and incubated with anti-HA or anti-Myc in PBS and 1% dried milk 1 h at room temperature. After washing with PBS-Tween and incubation with secondary Abs, a chemiluminescence detection system was used for protein detection (PerkinElmer Life Sciences).Flow Cytometry Studies—Receptor internalization was determined as the level of receptor loss from the cell surface. Stably transfected CHO cells were seeded on 6-well plates (4 × 105 cells/well) 1 day prior to the assay. Cells were then washed with PBS and incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium F-12 with the indicated concentration of coumarins for a specific time period. Cells were rinsed once with PBS and treated with 1 μm PAF for the appropriate time in medium containing 0.2% BSA. Cells were then washed once with PBS containing 2% BSA and harvested in ice-cold PBS. Cells were first labeled with or without anti-Myc antibody on ice for 1 h. After washing twice with ice-cold PBS, cells were incubated for an additional 45 min with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse Ab on ice and washed as described above. Antibody-labeled cells were analyzed for fluorescence intensity on a FACScan flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) with dead cells excluded by gating on forward and side scatter.Ligand Internalization—The ligand internalization kinetics had been evaluated in CHO cells stably transfected with the c-Myc-hPAFR-GyrB in 12-well plates (2 × 105 cells/well). After 24 h, cells were pretreated or not with coumermycin (15 μm for 10, 45, 80, 120, 180, and 210 min). Cells were then incubated at 37 °C with 2 nm [3H]hexadecyl-PAF in a buffer containing 150 mm choline chloride, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, and 0.2% lipid-free BSA for 45 min. After the incubation period, cells were washed twice with 1 ml of the same buffer but containing 2% BSA. Cells were then lysed in 0.1 n NaOH, and internalized radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation.Confocal Microscopy—COS-7 cells were grown on 25-mm coverslips and transiently transfected with pcDNA3-c-Myc-hPAFR-GyrB and green fluorescent protein (GFP)-conjugated arrestin 2 or arrestin 3 (kind gifts from Dr. J. Benovic, Philadelphia) using FuGENE 6 and processed as described previously (35Lukashova V. Asselin C. Krolewski J.J. Rola-Pleszczynski M. Stankova J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24113-24121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Cells were incubated at 37 °C in the presence or absence of coumermycin or novobiocin (15 μm, 180 min) and then treated or not with 1 μm PAF for 80 min. Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (15 min at room temperature) and permeabilized in 0.1% saponin. Cells were then incubated with anti-Myc Ab followed by rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-mouse Ab. Cells were examined, as described (35Lukashova V. Asselin C. Krolewski J.J. Rola-Pleszczynski M.

Optical sections were collected at 1-μm intervals with a 10-μm pinhole aperture. Digitized images were obtained with 256 × line averaging and enhanced with Intervision software (NORAN Instruments, Inc.) on a Silicon Graphics O2-work station.Inositol Phosphate (IP) Determination—Stably transfected CHO cells expressing c-Myc-hPAFR-GyrB were plated on 6-well dishes (4 × 105 cells/well) and incubated at 37 °C in complete medium 12 h before the assay. Cells were then washed once in PBS and labeled for 18–24 h with myo-[3H]inositol at 3 μCi/ml in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (high glucose, without inositol). After labeling, cells were washed once in PBS, preincubated at 37 °C in prewarmed modified medium containing 20 mm LiCl for 10 min. Medium was then removed, and cells were pretreated, or not, with 15 μm coumermycin or 15 μm novobiocin for the indicated periods of time in modified medium containing 20 mm LiCl. Cells were washed with PBS and incubated in prewarmed medium containing 0.2% BSA and 20 mm LiCl for 10 min with 1 μm PAF. The reactions were terminated with the addition of perchloric acid followed by a 30-min incubation on ice. IPs were extracted as described previously (30Le Gouill C. Parent J.L. Caron C.A.

Total labeled IPs were then counted by liquid scintillation.Radioligand Binding Assay—Competition binding curves were done on CHO cells expressing the c-Myc wild-type or GyrB receptor species, and binding reactions with 10 nm [3H]WEB2086 were done as described before (12Le Gouill C. Parent J.L. Rola-Pleszczynski M. Stankova J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21289-21295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Internalization experiments were done on stably transfected CHO cells seeded onto 100-mm dishes 24 h prior to assay. Cells were washed once with PBS and pretreated or not with the indicated inhibitors (3 μm staurosporine, 20 min; 2 μm GF109203X, 30 min; and 10 μm tyrphostin 51, 25 min) or 80 nm PKC activator PMA, 30 min at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium F-12. Cells were then washed with PBS and incubated at 37 °C with 15 μm coumarins for the indicated periods of time. Binding reactions were done on ice as described above.RESULTSDimerization of hPAFR—To study whether hPAFR can form dimers, albeit under conditions of overexpression, we used COS-7 cells transiently expressing c-Myc epitope-tagged hPAFR. Immunoblotting of c-Myc epitope-tagged receptor with rabbit anti-c-Myc antibody consistently revealed the presence of molecular species corresponding to the expected positions of the monomeric receptor (38–45 kDa). Forms corresponding to twice that of the monomer (80–85 kDa) were also observed, suggesting the existence of an SDS-resistant dimeric species of hPAFR (Fig. 1A, lane 2). Higher molecular mass forms of hPAFR were also detected, possibly corresponding to putative higher order structures, such as receptor tetramers. No immunoreactive bands were detected in lysates prepared from non-transfected cells (Fig. 1A, lane 1). The identity of the dimer was confirmed by immunoprecipitation experiments using differentially tagged receptors. In cells coexpressing both HA- and c-Myc-tagged hPAFR, blotting of the anti-c-Myc immunoprecipitate with the anti-HA antibody revealed the presence of hPAFR, indicating that dimerization occurred between the two different epitope-tagged receptors (Fig. 1B, lane 1). The specificity of the antibodies is illustrated by absence of cross-reactivity in cells expressing only one tagged receptor species (Fig. 1B, lane 2).Characterization of the hPAFR-GyrB—To study the effect of artificially induced dimerization of hPAFR on cells, we constructed a chimeric cDNA encoding hPAFR and GyrB as a fusion protein (hPAFR-GyrB) and generated a stable c-Myc-hPAFR-GyrB-expressing CHO cell line. Coumermycin acts as a natural dimerizer of GyrB because it binds GyrB with a stoichiometry of 1:2, whereas a related coumarin antibiotic, novobiocin, binds GyrB as a 1:1 complex and thus serves as a nondimerizing control (36Ali J.A. Jackson A.P. Howells A.J. Maxwell A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2717-2724Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). We next determined the effect of fusing GyrB on hPAFR properties by comparing CHO cells stably expressing the c-Myc-wild-type hPAFR with CHO cells stably transfected with c-Myc-hPAFR-GyrB. Flow cytometry studies showed that wild-type hPAFR and hPAFR-GyrB had similar cell surface expression levels (Fig. 2, A and B), indicating that GyrB had no significant effect on cellular trafficking and distribution of the receptor. Binding characteristics were determined using the PAF receptor antagonist, [3H]WEB2086, by competition with WEB2086. Competition binding experiments showed that the affinity of WEB2086 for hPAFR-GyrB was the same as for the wild-type receptor (Fig. 2C). To investigate the signaling capacity of the chimeric receptor, we examined the ability of hPAFR-GyrB to mediate the stimulation of phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis. Agonist-independent basal IP production and agonist-induced increased IP production were very similar in both c-Myc-hPAFR and c-Myc-hPAFR-GyrB transfected cells (Fig. 2D). Thus, the addition of the GyrB moiety did not lead to detectable changes in hPAFR coupling.Fig. 2Expression, binding, and signaling of wild-type hPAFR and hPAFR-GyrB receptors in CHO cells.

https://openalex.org/W2022510575,"Degradation of IgM μ heavy chains in light chain-negative pre-B cells is independent of vesicular transport, as is evident by its insensitivity to brefeldin A or cell permeabilization. Conversely, by the same criteria, degradation of the secretory μs heavy chain in light chain-expressing B cells depends on vesicular transport. To investigate whether the presence of conventional light chains or the developmental stage of the B-lymphocytes dictates the degradative route taken by μ, we express in 70Z/3 pre-B cells either λ ectopically or κ by lipopolysaccharides-stimulated differentiation into B cells and show their assembly with μ heavy chains. The resulting sensitivity of μ degradation to brefeldin A and cell permeabilization demonstrates that conventional light chains, a hallmark of B cell differentiation, are necessary and sufficient to divert μ from a vesicular transport-independent to a vesicular transport-dependent degradative route. Although both routes converge at the ubiquitin-proteasome degradation pathway, only in light chain-expressing cells is vesicular transport a prerequisite for μ ubiquitination.

Although both routes converge at the ubiquitin-proteasome degradation pathway, only in light chain-expressing cells is vesicular transport a prerequisite for μ ubiquitination. Differentiation of B-lymphocytes is accompanied by a regulated switch in the expression pattern and stability of surface and secretory Igs. The secretory form of IgM (sIgM), 1The abbreviations used are: sIgM, secretory form of IgM; ALLN, N-acetyl-leucyl-leucyl-norlecinal; BFA, brefeldin A; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; ERAD, endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation; HRP, horseradish peroxidase; LPS, lipopolysaccharides; MG-132, carboxybenzyl-leucyl-leucyl-leucinal; SLC, surrogate light chain; Z-L3 VS, carboxybenzyl-leucyl-leucyl-leucine vinyl sulfone; E2, ubiquitin carrier protein; E3, ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase. a stable molecule that is efficiently secreted from plasma cells, is rapidly degraded at the earlier differentiation stages of pre-B and B cells (1Amitay R.

In the 38C B cell line, this degradation is selective to the sIgM that contains the secretory heavy chain μs, whereas the very similar membrane form of IgM that contains the membrane heavy chain μm is stable and displayed at the cell surface (1Amitay R. Bar-Nun S. Haimovich J. Rabinovich E. Shachar I. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12568-12573Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Amitay R. Shachar I. Rabinovich E. Haimovich J. Bar-Nun S. J.

Chem. 1992; 267: 24241-24247Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This selective sIgM degradation is nonlysosomal and occurs prior to the trans-Golgi (1Amitay R. Bar-Nun S. Haimovich J. Rabinovich E. Shachar I. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12568-12573Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), yet it requires vesicular transport from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (2Rabinovich E.

Chem. 1992; 267: 20694-20700Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This implicates quality control mechanism(s) not only in association with the ER but also along the secretory pathway. Quality control refers to the process by which misfolded proteins or unassembled subunits of oligomeric complexes are recognized and prevented from deployment to distal compartments of the secretory pathway (6Hammond C. Helenius A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 523-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). These aberrant proteins are dislocated across the ER membrane to be ultimately degraded by the cytoplasmic proteasome via a ubiquitin-dependent process known as the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) (7Kopito R.R. Cell. 1997; 88: 427-430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar, 8Brodsky J.L. McCracken A.A.

Biol. 1998; 14: 19-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). Although ERAD is widely viewed as a system for eliminating aberrant proteins, this mechanism is also responsible for regulated degradation of correctly folded ER proteins in response to metabolic cues (10Hampton R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2002; 18: 345-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 11Hampton R.Y. Gardner R.G. Rine J. Mol. Biol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 35840-35847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). In the current study we investigate the possibility that selective ERAD is also crucial for regulating the IgM expression during B cell differentiation. The degradation of most mammalian ERAD substrates is not affected by brefeldin A (BFA) (13Klausner R.D. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Bonifacino J.S. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1990; 6: 403-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar, 14Klausner R.D. Donaldson J.G. Lippincott-Schwartz J. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 1071-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (1548) Google Scholar). Conversely, as indicated above, the degradation of sIgM depends on vesicular transport, as demonstrated by the marked stabilization of sIgM in BFA-treated (2Rabinovich E. Bar-Nun S. Amitay R.

Chem. 1996; 271: 27645-27651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) 38C B cells. It could have indicated that μ heavy chains are not recognized as an ERAD substrate in B cells. This possibility is ruled out by the vesicular transport-independent degradation of both μs and μm, provided that these heavy chains are either unassembled because of light chain deficiency (2Rabinovich E. Bar-Nun S. Amitay R. Shachar I. Gur B. Taya M. Haimovich J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24145-24148Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or disassembled from light chains upon thiol treatment (3Winitz D. Shachar I. Elkabetz Y. Amitay R. Samuelov M. Bar-Nun S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27645-27651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Clearly, the degradation of these free μ heavy chains is sensitive neither to BFA nor to cell permeabilization. Nonetheless, upon association with κ light chain, the μs is diverted to a distinct degradation process, which depends on vesicular transport. Because expression of conventional light chains is the hallmark of differentiation of pre-B to B cells, the striking effect of the κ light chain on the intracellular fate of its partner, the μ heavy chain, prompted us to investigate the nature of this developmental change in the mode of μ degradation. Such a developmental switch may be one of the many events that comprise differentiation. Alternatively, it may reflect an exclusive impact of the light chain in the course of pre-B to B cell differentiation. To distinguish between these possibilities, we made use of the 70Z/3 pre-B cell line. When stimulated with lipopolysaccharides (LPS), theses cells can differentiate in culture from a light chain-negative pre-B cell into a κ-expressing B cell (15Paige C.J. Kincade P.W. Ralph P. J. Immunol. 1978; 121: 641-647PubMed Google Scholar). To bring about a light chain expression without causing differentiation, we expressed λ light chain ectopically. We show that both conventional light chains assemble with μ heavy chains and divert these assembled μ from a transport-independent degradation process to a vesicular transport-dependent one. Nonetheless, our data reveal that both routes converge at the ubiquitin-proteasome degradation pathway. Cell Lines—The murine 70Z/3 pre-B cell line (American Type Culture Collection; catalog number TIB-158), and the 38C B-lymphocyte cell line were grown as previously described (1Amitay R. Bar-Nun S. Haimovich J. Rabinovich E. Shachar I. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12568-12573Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 70Z/3 cells were stimulated to produce κ light chain by an 18-h incubation with 5 μg/ml LPS (Sigma) (15Paige C.J. Kincade P.W. Ralph P. J. Immunol. 1978; 121: 641-647PubMed Google Scholar). The degree of differentiation into B cells was estimated by cytofluorometric analyses, staining the cells with R6-60.2 anti-IgM antibody (Pharmingen). Ectopic Expression in 70Z/3 Cells of λ Light Chain Using a Vaccinia Virus/T7 RNA Polymerase Hybrid System—The vaccinia virus/T7 RNA polymerase overexpression hybrid system (16Elroy-Stein O. Moss B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6743-6747Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) was used. λI cDNA was generated by reverse transcribing RNA from COS-7 cells transiently transfected with pJDEλI genomic λI vector (kindly provided by Y. Argon), followed by PCR using PWO DNA polymerase (Roche Applied Science) and these forward (5′-CCATGCCATGGCCTGGATTTCACTTATAC-3′) and reverse (5′-TCTCCCCCGGGCTAGGAACAGTCAGCACGG-3′) primers. The λI cDNA was cloned between the NcoI and SmaI sites of pTM1 (17Moss B. Elroy-Stein O. Mizukami T. Alexander W.A. Fuerst T.R. Nature. 1990; 348: 91-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar), and its authenticity was verified by DNA sequencing. Preparation of λI-encoding vaccinia virus was according to Current Protocols in Molecular Biology (18Ausubel F.M. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. 3. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York2001: 16.15-16.19Google Scholar). Confluent HuTK-143B cells, maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin, were infected with WR wild-type vaccinia virus and 4 h later were transfected with the pTM1-λI. Thirty minutes later, the cells were covered with fresh medium that was also supplemented with 5 μg/ml bromodeoxyuridine and 100 μg/ml Neutral Red (Sigma) and in which low melting Agarose (Amresco) was dissolved to 1%. Recombinant bromodeoxyuridine-resistant plaques were obtained and tested by PCR for the presence of λI cDNA with the primers described above. Positive clones were enriched and purified by three additional cycles of infection, plaque selection, and PCR testing. Large scale preparation of λI-encoding vaccinia virus were made in HeLa cells 3 days post-infection, and viral titers were estimated by serial dilution and infection of CV-1 cells, followed by crystal violet staining. Viral stocks were stored at -80 °C. A 20 multiplicity of infection of λI or WR (“mock”) viruses along with a 10 multiplicity of infection of T7 RNA polymerase viruses were mixed with an equal volume of trypsin (0.25 mg/ml; Worthington). The mixtures were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C, sonicated in a bath sonicator on ice (three bursts of 10 s each), and then immediately added to 70Z/3 cells (107 cells in 0.5 ml of RPMI supplemented with 2.5% fetal calf serum). After3hof continuous agitation at 37 °C, the cells were diluted 20-fold to 106 cells/ml with the same medium, and the infected cells were assayed 10–13 h later. Biosynthetic Labeling, Cell Permeabilization, and in Vitro Incubation—The cells were pulse-labeled with [35S]methionine and either chased in vivo (1Amitay R. Bar-Nun S. Haimovich J. Rabinovich E. Shachar I. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12568-12573Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or permeabilized with 35 μg/ml digitonin (Calbiochem), resuspended in growth medium, and chased in vitro (3Winitz D. Shachar I. Elkabetz Y. Amitay R. Samuelov M. Bar-Nun S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27645-27651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Where indicated, BFA, N-acetyl-leucyl-leucyl-norlecinal (ALLN), carboxybenzyl-leucyl-leucyl-leucinal (MG-132), carboxybenzyl-leucyl-leucyl-leucine vinyl sulfone (Z-L3 VS), or dithiothreitol were added. The ALLN (100 μm; Calbiochem), MG-132 (5 μm; Calbiochem), BFA (5 μg/ml; Epicentre), or dithiothreitol (5 mm) was added to the chase medium, whereas Z-L3 VS (50 μm) was present during the starvation, pulse, and chase. Immunoprecipitation, Immunoblotting, Lectin Blotting, and Treatment with Endoglycosidase H—IgM was immunoprecipitated from lysates obtained from an identical number of intact or permeabilized cells, normalized for equal cell protein and equal 35S incorporated into total cell protein. To ensure immunoprecipitation of the entire IgM, an excess of goat anti-mouse IgM antibodies was used, followed by protein A-Sepharose (Repligen). Immunoprecipitated μ or total cell proteins were resolved by reducing or nonreducing SDS-PAGE and electroblotted onto nitrocellulose, and the blots were probed with the indicated antibodies. When radiolabeled proteins were resolved, the gels were either directly autoradiographed or first electroblotted, and then the blots were autoradiographed and subsequently probed. The latter protocol, which is routinely used and is represented here in Fig. 5B, confirms that at each time point throughout the chase, identical steady-state amounts of μ protein are immunoprecipitated, which include the radiolabeled μ. This indicates that the decrease with time in radiolabeled μ reflects a net loss of intracellular μ. Incubation of immunoprecipitated IgM with endoglycosidase H (New England Biolabs) was as previously described (1Amitay R. Bar-Nun S. Haimovich J. Rabinovich E. Shachar I. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12568-12573Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Assembly of μ with either κ or λ was verified by the positive staining of anti-IgM immunoprecipitates resolved by nonreducing SDS-PAGE with both anti-μ and either anti-κ or anti-λ antibodies. Assembly efficiency of μ with λ, κ, or both (mixed population) was based on densitometry of the various assembly species detected by anti-μ, anti-λ, or anti-κ antibodies, respectively. Each assembly species was calculated as a percentage of the sum of all of the assembly species within the same lane detected by a certain antibody. Ubiquitination of μ was verified by probing anti-IgM immunoprecipitates with an anti-ubiquitin antibody. The antibodies used were: horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-mouse μ (Sigma), rabbit anti-μs (19Rabinovich E. Kerem A. Frohlich K.U. Diamant N. Bar-Nun S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 626-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar), mouse anti-BiP (StressGen), and mouse anti-ubiquitin (clone P4D1, BabCO). The appropriate HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies were from Sigma. Galactosylation of immunoprecipitated IgM was detected by lectin blotting with biotin-conjugated Ricinus communis agglutinin, as previously described (5Shachar I. Amitay R. Rabinovich E. Haimovich J. Bar-Nun S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24241-24247Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). HRP was visualized by ECL reaction. κ Light Chain Assembles with μ Heavy Chain, Displaces BiP, and Enables Maturation and Surface Expression of μm—The intracellular fate of IgM during B cell differentiation was followed in the well characterized 70Z/3 cell line (15Paige C.J.

In unstimulated 70Z/3 cells, the majority of μ heavy chains were found either free or engaged in μ2 homodimers (Fig. 1A, lane 3). Although low levels of hemimers composed of μ and λ5 surrogate light chain (SLC) were observed, higher assembly forms of μ2λ52 monomers were not found (Fig. 1A, lane 3). Expression of κ light chain was not detected in unstimulated 70Z/3 cells (Fig. 1A, lane 6). Upon LPS stimulation, induction of κ expression resulted in efficient formation of μκ hemimers, which further assembled into μ2κ2 monomers, as detected both by anti-μ (Fig. 1A, lane 2) and anti-κ (Fig. 1A, lane 5) antibodies, and the levels of μ2 homodimers were greatly diminished (Fig. 1A, lane 2). Interestingly, despite the relatively large quantities of μκ hemimers and μ2κ2 monomers, minute amounts of SLC-containing μλ5 hemimers were still detected (Fig. 1A, lane 2). The expression of κ and its assembly with μ altered the intracellular fate of the latter, resulting in considerable maturation and cell surface expression of the membrane μm. This was indicated by the retarded mobility (Fig. 1B, lane 2), the increase from 18 to 42% of μ that acquired resistance to endoglycosidase H (Fig. 1C, compare lanes 1 and 3), the galactosylation of μ in the trans-Golgi detected by lectin blotting only in LPS-stimulated 70Z/3 cells (Fig. 1D, compare lanes 1 and 2), and the increase in surface membrane form of IgM from 14% in unstimulated 70Z/3 cells to 76% in LPS-stimulated 70Z/3 cells, as detected by cytofluorometric analysis (Fig. 1E). This indicated that only in the presence of κ, did a substantial fraction of μm traverse the entire secretory pathway to be displayed at the cell surface, where it served as a B cell receptor (20Alt F.W.

The large quantities of BiP that co-precipitated with μ (Fig. 1B, lane 3) suggested that, also in 70Z/3 pre-B cells, the intracellular retention of unassembled μ was mediated to a large extent by the interaction of μ with BiP. Indeed, upon κ expression and its assembly with μ, the levels of BiP that co-precipitated with μ markedly decreased (Fig. 1B, lane 4), even though the cellular levels of BiP were hardly affected (Fig. 1B, lanes 5 and 6). Inasmuch as κ expression was also correlated with the intracellular transport of μm to the cell surface, our results were consistent with the notion that upon differentiation, the expressed κ assembled with μ and displaced BiP. κ Expression, the Hallmark of Pre-B to B Cell Differentiation, Diverts μ from a Vesicular Transport-independent to a Vesicular Transport-dependent Degradation—Because differentiation of 70Z/3 pre-B cells to κ-expressing B cells was manifested by modified assembly patterns, maturation, and surface expression of μm and displacement of BiP (Fig. 1), we anticipated that this developmental passage would be accompanied by a conversion in the degradation mode of the μ heavy chains. When μ stability was followed in pulse-chase experiments, t½ of ∼55 min was measured in unstimulated 70Z/3 cells (Fig. 2, lanes 1–3 and open circles), reflecting rapid degradation of both μs and μm. The addition of BFA during chase hardly affected μ degradation (t½ of ∼50 min; Fig. 2, lanes 4–6 and open squares). In the LPS-stimulated cells, μ chains, which were predominantly assembled with κ (Fig. 1A), still disappeared as rapidly, with a measured t½ of ∼55 min (Fig. 2, lanes 10–12 and closed circles). Because assembled μm is a stable molecule (1Amitay R. Bar-Nun S. Haimovich J. Rabinovich E. Shachar I. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12568-12573Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), this half-life probably reflected degradation of assembled μs as well as of μs and μm that remained unassembled. That unassembled μs and μm represented a minor proportion of μ was indicated by the nearly arrested degradation of μ in the presence of BFA in these LPS-stimulated cells. This extension of t½ to >9 h (Fig. 2, lanes 13–15 and closed squares) reflected that the majority of μs was indeed assembled with κ and was therefore diverted to the vesicular transport-dependent degradation. The change in the mode of μ degradation that accompanied pre-B to B cell differentiation was corroborated by experiments in permeabilized cells in which vesicular transport was severely hampered (3Winitz D. Shachar I. Elkabetz Y. Amitay R. Samuelov M. Bar-Nun S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27645-27651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). When pulse-labeled 70Z/3 cells were permeabilized with digitonin and incubated in vitro, the stability of μ heavy chains correlated with the stage of differentiation and the expression of κ light chain. In unstimulated κ-negative cells, μ chains were rapidly degraded during the in vitro incubations (t½ = 54 min; Fig. 2, lanes 7–9 and open triangles), with kinetics very similar to those measured in intact cells. Remarkably, permeabilization of LPS-stimulated κ-expressing cells resulted in stabilization of μ during the in vitro incubation, with t½ significantly extended to 3.7 h (Fig. 2, lanes 16–18 and closed triangles). Taken together, these results demonstrate that upon differentiation into κ-expressing B cells, κ-assembled μ heavy chains are diverted from a BFA-insensitive transport-independent degradation to a BFA-sensitive vesicular transport-dependent process. Ectopically Expressed λ Light Chain Assembles with μ Heavy Chains and Diverts Them to a Vesicular Transport-dependent Degradation—The striking effect of the pre-B to B differentiation on the intracellular fate of μ heavy chains (Fig. 2) was not necessarily the consequence of κ expression and its evident assembly with μ but could be simply the result of the differentiation stage, regardless of light chain expression. To test whether the mere contribution of the pre-B to B cell differentiation to the intracellular fate of μ was to provide the light chain, the latter was ectopically expressed in pre-B cells by infection with a light chain-encoding vaccinia virus. It allowed us to achieve light chain expression while circumventing differentiation into B cells. To verify that indeed ectopic light chain expression does not trigger differentiation into κ-expressing B cells, we chose to express λ rather than κ. Moreover, it allowed us to generalize our observations vis à vis the effect of conventional Ig light chains on the intracellular fate of their partner μ heavy chains. Pulse-chase experiments following mock infection revealed a prolonged t½ of μ chains from ∼1 h (Fig. 2) to 2.5 h (Fig. 3A, lanes 1–4 and open circles), with BFA exerting only a slight effect (t½ = 3.5 h; Fig. 3A, lanes 5–8 and open squares). In 70Z/3 cells infected with λ-encoding virus, μ chains disappeared with a somewhat extended t½ of 3.7 h (Fig. 3A, lanes 9–12 and closed circles). However, when BFA was added to these λ-expressing 70Z/3 cells, the μ chains were markedly stabilized with half-life extended to >9.5 h (Fig. 3A, lanes 13–16 and closed squares). This BFA-dependent stabilization of μ correlated with its assembly with λ (Fig. 3B). In mock infected 70Z/3 cells, expression of the λ light chain was not detected (lane 9), and the majority of μ heavy chains were found either free, assembled into μ2 homodimers, or assembled into λ5 SLC-containing hemimers (lane 3; see also Fig. 1A, lane 3). When cells were infected with the λ-encoding virus, assembly into predominant μ2λ2 monomers was detected, because these assembly species stained positive with both anti-μ (lane 4) and anti-λ (lane 10) antibodies. Importantly, λ ectopic expression did not trigger differentiation into κ-expressing cells, based on the negative reactivity with an anti-κ antibody (lane 16). The assembly of μ into μ2λ2 monomers was significant in λ-infected cells (∼50% of all μ-containing species within lane 4). On the other hand, when calculated relative to all the λ-containing species within the same lane (lane 10), the assembly into μ2λ2 reached only 15%. This was not due to inefficient assembly into μ2λ2, because λ was in excess (lane 10) and also the assembly of μ into μ2κ2 monomers in LPS-treated cells did not exceed 50% when calculated relatively to all μ-containing species within the same lane (lane 5). Note that the apparent intense band of μ2κ2 (lane 5) reflected the ∼2-fold increase in μ expression upon LPS stimulation. Interestingly, when 70Z/3 cells were first stimulated by LPS and then infected with λ-encoding virus, we could detect inherent differences between the capacity of pre-B and B cells to promote assembly of μ with λ into μ2λ2 monomers (compare lanes 10 and 12). This ∼2-fold improvement took place despite the vast amount of κ (lane 18) and the apparent preference of μ to assemble with κ in B cells. This preference was manifested by the poor assembly of μ and λ when λ was introduced into the 38C B cells, which constitutively express abundant κ and μ (lane 8). Nonetheless, whenever κ or λ conventional light chains are expressed, a stabilization of μ by BFA is observed (Figs. 2 and 3). We necessarily interpret these findings as the competence of conventional light chains to assemble with the μ heavy chain and divert it from a BFA-insensitive, vesicular transport-independent degradation to a BFA-sensitive, vesicular transport-dependent degradation. Both Modes of μ Degradation Are Proteasomal—The first indication that the loss of intracellular 35S-labeled μ was the consequence of proteasomal degradation was the prevention of this loss by ALLN, a relatively nonspecific proteasome inhibitor. This applied to the vesicular transport-independent degradation of unassembled (24Mancini R. Fagioli C. Fra A.M. Maggioni C. Sitia R. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 769-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) or disassembled (3Winitz D. Shachar I. Elkabetz Y. Amitay R. Samuelov M. Bar-Nun S. J. Biol.

Shachar I. Rabinovich E. Haimovich J. Bar-Nun S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20694-20700Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To elucidate the role of the proteasome in these two degradative processes, we compared the effect of the proteasome inhibitors ALLN, MG-132 (25Rock K.L. Gramm C. Rothstein L. Clark K. Stein R. Dick L. Hwang D. Goldberg A.L. Cell. 1994; 78: 761-771Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2206) Google Scholar), and Z-L3 VS. The latter compound is a more specific irreversible inhibitor that was shown to bind covalently to a critical active site threonine in the proteasomal β subunits (26Bogyo M. McMaster J.S.

The data in Fig. 4 revealed that the transport-independent degradation of unassembled μ in unstimulated 70Z/3 pre-B cells was more (>7-fold) sensitive to ALLN than to Z-L3 VS; the t½ of μ was extended from ∼40 min (Fig. 4A, open triangles) to >20 h (Fig. 4A, closed diamonds) in the presence of ALLN but only to ∼160 min (Fig. 4A, closed triangles) in the presence of Z-L3 VS. The reverse phenomenon was observed in the κ-expressing LPS-stimulated 70Z/3 cells, where the vesicular transport-dependent degradation of μs was >4-fold more sensitive to Z-L3 VS than to ALLN; the t½ of μs increased from ∼40 min (Fig. 4B, open circles)to >10 h in the presence of Z-L3 VS (Fig. 4B, closed circles) but only to ∼140 min with ALLN (Fig. 4B, closed diamonds). For comparison, we investigated the differential inhibitory effects exerted by pretreatment with Z-L3 VS on the κ-expressing 38C cells (Fig. 4C), where the assembly state of μ could be altered by treating cells with thiols (3Winitz D.

Clearly, upon pretreatment with Z-L3 VS, the vesicular transport-independent degradation of disassembled μ was 2.4-fold slower, extending t½ from 35 min (Fi"

We examined the mechanism of the transacylation system using partially purified acyl-CoA:lysophosphatidylinositol (LPI) acyltransferase (LPIAT) from rat liver microsomes to test our hypothesis that both the reverse and forward reactions of acyl-CoA:lysophospholipid acyltransferases are involved in the CoA-dependent transacylation process. The purified LPIAT fraction exhibited ATP-independent acyl-CoA synthetic activity and CoA-dependent LPI generation from PI, suggesting that LPIAT could operate in reverse to form acyl-CoA and LPI. CoA-dependent acylation of LPI by the purified LPIAT fraction required PI as the acyl donor. In addition, the combination of purified LPIAT and recombinant lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase could reconstitute CoA-dependent transacylation between PI and phosphatidic acid. These results suggest that the CoA-dependent transacylation system consists of the following: 1) acyl-CoA synthesis from phospholipid through the reverse action of acyl-CoA:lysophospholipid acyltransferases; and 2) transfer of fatty acyl moiety from the newly formed acyl-CoA to lysophospholipid through the forward action of acyl-CoA:lysophospholipid acyltransferases.

The fatty acyl moieties of phospholipids are not static but instead are dynamically turned over. Acyltransferases and transacylases catalyze the acylation of lysophospholipids and are involved in the biosynthesis and fatty acid remodeling of phospholipids (1Lands W.E.M. Crawford C.G.

Despite the importance of CoA-dependent transacylation system in fatty acid remodeling of phospholipids, the mechanism underlying the transacylation system is not fully understood yet.

Previously, we demonstrated ATP-independent and CoA-dependent acyl-CoA synthesis in microsomal fractions of mammalian tissues (13Sugiura T. Kudo N. Ojima T. Mabuchi-Itoh K. Yamashita A. Waku K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1255: 167-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 14Sugiura T. Kudo N. Ojima T. Kondo S. Yamashita A. Waku K. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 440-450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This fatty acyl-CoA synthesis is distinct from the well known acyl-CoA synthetase activity that ligates fatty acids and CoA in the presence of ATP and Mg2+. Because lysophospholipids such as lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) and lysophosphatidylinositol (LPI) were concomitantly formed during the acyl-CoA formation, we assumed that the CoA-dependent/ATP-independent acyl-CoA synthesis is because of the reverse reactions of acyl-CoA:lysophospholipid acyltransferases (Scheme 1, upper equation). Further, we hypothesized that the CoA-dependent transacylation system consists of the following: 1) acyl-CoA synthesis through the reverse action of acyl-CoA: lysophospholipid acyltransferases; and 2) the transfer of a fatty acyl moiety from the newly formed acyl-CoA to lysophospholipid through the forward action of the acyltransferases (Scheme 1). To evaluate the model, we previously examined the detailed enzymology of recombinant acyltransferase (15Yamashita A. Kawagishi N. Miyashita T. Nagatsuka T. Sugiura T. Kume K. Shimizu T. Waku K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26745-26752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). We used the mouse lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) acyltransferase (mLPAAT) (16Kume K. Shimizu T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 237: 663-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), because LPAAT was the first to be cloned and is currently the only available acyltransferase active toward lysophospholipids, although this enzyme is involved in de novo synthesis of glycerolipids rather than fatty acid remodeling of phospholipids. The recombinant LPAAT could catalyze the ATP-independent acyl-CoA synthesis from phosphatidic acid (PA). LPA was also formed concomitantly. These results suggested that mLPAAT can operate in reverse to form acyl-CoA and LPA. Furthermore, we observed a CoA-dependent transacylation activity toward LPA in mLPAAT. We concluded that CoA-dependent transacylation activity toward LPA is catalyzed by a combination of the reverse and forward reactions of LPAAT (Scheme 1). These results suggested that the hypothesis is correct for LPAAT. We next wanted to test the model with other acyltransferases, in particular, the acyltransferases involved in phospholipid remodeling, such as acyl-CoA:LPC acyltransferase (LPCAT) and acyl-CoA:LPI acyltransferase (LPIAT). In this study, we solubilized and partially purified LPIAT from rat liver to examine whether LPIAT can catalyze ATP-independent acyl-CoA synthesis and CoA-dependent transacylation activity. To date, most attempts to solubilize membrane-associated acyltransferases and transacylases with detergents resulted in immediate and complete loss of enzyme activity. Fortunately we found that low levels of CHAPS did not affect the activity and that addition of crude soybean phospholipids (azolectin) could stabilize the enzyme activity after solubilization and during purification. We also found that LPIAT and the CoA-dependent transacylation activity toward LPI copurified during the chromatographic procedures. Partially purified LPIAT catalyzed ATP-independent acyl-CoA synthetic activity with PI. These results are consistent with the CoA-dependent transacylation activity toward LPI being because of a combination of the reverse and forward reactions of LPIAT. In addition, we found that the combination of purified LPIAT and recombinant LPAAT catalyzed CoA-dependent transacylation between PI and PA. We conclude that the CoA-dependent transacylation activity is because of the combination of the reverse and forward reactions of acyl-CoA acyltransferases.

After the enzyme treatment, the lysophospholipids were purified by TLC, so the lysophospholipids did not contain parent phospholipid or fatty acid (over 95% pure). We did not check the positional purity of 2-acyl LPI but used the material as soon as possible to reduce fatty acid migration. CHAPS and octylglucoside were purchased from Dojindo Laboratories (Kumamoto, Japan). Triton X-100 and sodium deoxycholic acid were from Wako Pure Chemicals (Tokyo, Japan). TSK gel AF-red-Toyopearl 650ML and TSK gel AF-blue-Toyopearl 650ML were purchased from Tohso (Tokyo, Japan). Bio-gel HTP and Econo-Pac Q cartridge were from Bio-Rad Laboratories (Hercules, CA). All other reagents were of reagent grade or better. Preparation of Microsomal Fraction from Rat Liver—Male Wistar rats, 250–350-g body weight, were fed ad libitum a control commercial diet (Oriental Yeast, Tokyo, Japan) and water. Livers were isolated rapidly, and microsomes were prepared by centrifugation as described previously (21Yamashita A. Sato K. Watanabe M. Tokudome Y. Sugiura T. Waku K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1211: 263-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 22Yamashita A. Watanabe M. Tonegawa T. Sugiura T. Waku K. Biochem.

Briefly, the organs were homogenized in a Potter-Elvehjem glass-Teflon homogenizer in STE buffer (0.25 m sucrose/0.1 m Tris-HCl/1 mm EDTA (pH 7.4)/protease inhibitor mixture set III (Number 539134; Calbiochem)), and then homogenate was centrifuged at 700 × g for 10 min to remove cell debris and nuclear materials. The supernatant was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min, and the resultant supernatant was further centrifuged at 105,000 × g for 60 min. The pellet (crude microsomes) was washed with STE buffer containing 0.6 m KCl to remove peripheral membrane proteins. The pellet was further washed with hypotonic solution (5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4)/protease inhibitors) to lyse microsomal vesicles and to remove lumenal proteins. The final pellet was suspended with STE buffer and used as the microsomal fraction. The protein content was determined by the method of Lowry et al. (23Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or by the BCA protein assay reagent (Pierce) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Assay of Acyl-CoA:Lysophospholipid Acyltransferases—Acyl-CoA:lysophospholipid acyltransferase activities were estimated from the incorporation of radiolabeled acyl-CoA into the corresponding phospholipid in the presence of lysophospholipid (11Sugiura T.

Stocks of LPI (12 mm), LPA (11 mm), and acyl-CoA (1 mm) were in aqueous solution, and aliquots were added into assays directly. Stocks of LPC (50 mm) and LPE (2 mm) were in chloroform/methanol. Solvent was evaporated from aliquots under a stream of nitrogen gas before the lysophospholipids were dissolved in buffer and added to the assays. 2-Acyl LPI was prepared as soon as possible before use to reduce fatty acid migration. For LPIAT assay, fractions such as microsomes, CHAPS extracts, and chromatographic eluates were incubated with 30 μm [14C]linoleoyl-CoA (40,000 dpm) and 50 μm LPI in 0.1 m Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4) for 2 min at 30 °C. In some experiments, the concentrations of acyl-CoAs and LPI were varied. In the case of CHAPS-solubilized enzyme, the detergent was diluted to 0.05% (w/v) in the assay system to avoid enzyme inhibition. Freshly prepared 2-acyl LPI and [14C]stearoyl-CoA were employed instead of LPI (1-acyl) and [14C]linoleoyl-CoA for the measurement of 2-acyl LPI acyltransferase activity. The reaction was terminated by addition of 3 ml of chloroform:methanol (1:2, v/v). After the addition of unlabeled PI as a carrier, total lipids were extracted according to the method of Bligh and Dyer (24Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (41848) Google Scholar) with acidic conditions (0.6 n HCl). Total lipids were separated by TLC in chloroform:methanol: 28% NH4OH (65:35:5, v/v). The band corresponding to product PI was visualized under UV light (365 nm) after spraying with primuline (0.001%, in acetone:water, 4:1, v/v), scraped from the plate into a vial, and the radioactivity was determined in a liquid scintillation spectrometer (LSC-3500; Aloka, Tokyo, Japan). For measurement of LPCAT, LPEAT, and LPAAT activities, the enzyme reaction employed LPC (50 μm; 1-palmitoyl-GPC), LPE (50 μm; 1-acyl-GPE), or LPA (40 μm; 1-oleoyl-GP) as acyl acceptors. Total lipids were separated by TLC in chloroform:methanol:water (65:25:4, v/v) for LPCAT and LPEAT or in chloroform:acetone:methanol:acetic acid:water (5:2:1:1:0.5, v/v) for LPAAT. The radioactivities of the product phospholipids were determined as described above. Measurement of CoA-dependent Transacylation Activity—CoA-dependent transacylation activities of [3H]LPI (1-acyl-GP[3H]inositol), [14C]LPC (1-[14C]palmitoyl-GPC), or [14C]LPA (1-[14C]palmitoyl-GP) was measured from the conversion of each lysophospholipid to the corresponding phospholipid in the presence of CoA (11Sugiura T.

Acta. 1994; 1211: 263-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). For the assay of CoA-dependent transacylation activity toward [3H]LPI, the enzyme fractions were incubated with 10 μm [3H]LPI (44,000 dpm) in the presence or absence of 20 μm CoA in 50 mm Hepes buffer (pH 7.4) containing 5 mm EGTA at 30 °C for various periods. CHAPS was kept below 0.05% (w/v) final concentration to minimize inhibition by detergent. In some cases, phospholipids were added to the assay system as acyl donors. Aliquots of phospholipids in chloroform/methanol were dried under a stream of nitrogen gas, and the phospholipid was dissolved in partially purified LPIAT fraction (containing 1% CHAPS, 16 mm) by brief sonication (Branson bath-type sonifier). Then, the reaction was started by addition of assay solution with radiolabeled lysophospholipids as acyl acceptors. The concentrations of [3H]LPI, CoA, and PI and the incubation time were varied in some cases. 2-[14C]Arachidonoyl LPI was employed instead of [3H]LPI for CoA-dependent transacylation activity toward 2-acyl-LPI. Reactions were terminated by addition of 3 ml of chloroform:methanol (1:2, v/v). After addition of unlabeled PI as a carrier, the total lipids were extracted as described above, separated by TLC in chloroform:acetone:methanol: acetic acid:water (5:2:1:1:0.5, v/v), and visualized by primuline, and product bands were quantitated as described above. For measurement of CoA-dependent transacylation toward LPC or LPA, enzyme reactions employed [14C]LPC (50 μm, 40,000 dpm) or [14C]LPA (50 μm, 50,000 dpm) as acyl acceptors. Total lipids were separated by TLC with chloroform:methanol:water (65:25:4, v/v) for acylation of [14C]LPC or with chloroform:acetone:methanol:acetic acid: water (5:2:1:1:0.5, v/v) for acylation of [14C]LPA. The radioactivities of the product phospholipid bands were determined as described above. CoA-dependent transacylation activity was also measured using radiolabeled acyl donors (phospholipids). Aliquots of phospholipids such as [14C]PI (1-stearoyl-2-[14C]arachidonoyl), [14C]PC (1-palmitoyl-2-[14C]linoleoyl), and [14C]PA (1-palmitoyl-2-[14C]linoleoyl) in organic solvent were dried under stream of nitrogen gas and dissolved in the partially purified LPIAT preparation (1% CHAPS) with brief sonication (Branson bath-type sonifier) before assay solution containing CoA and various lysophospholipid as acyl acceptor was added to start the reaction. Phospholipids were extracted and separated by two-dimensional TLC (13Sugiura T. Kudo N. Ojima T. Mabuchi-Itoh K. Yamashita A. Waku K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1255: 167-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). After detection of individual phospholipids by primuline, their radioactivity was determined as described above, and the transfer of [14C]fatty acid from phospholipid to lysophospholipid was calculated. Solubilization of Liver Microsomes by CHAPS—Rat liver microsomes were treated with 1% CHAPS, 20% ethylene glycol, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) (protein/detergent was ∼0.5) and then carefully sonicated (10% maximum output for 15 s with 1 min pause, 2 cycles; Branson Sonifier Type 250 with microtip; Danbury, CT) in an ice bath. The cloudy microsomal suspension turned clear upon sonication. The clear solution was centrifuged at 105,000 × g for 60 min, and the resultant supernatant was taken as the CHAPS extract. Phospholipids were quantitated by organic phosphate determination (25Rouser G. Siakotos A.N. Fleischer S. Lipids. 1966; 1: 85-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (1312) Google Scholar). In some cases, the CHAPS extract was dialyzed against 100 volumes of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4)/0.1 mm dithiothreitol/0.1 mm EDTA for 4 h with three changes of the buffer. Partial Purification of LPIAT from Rat Liver Microsomes—All procedures were performed at 4 °C. LPIAT was partially purified from rat liver microsomes by successive chromatographies on TSK gel AF-red-Toyopearl 650ML, Bio-gel HTP, Econo-Pac Q, TSK gel AF-heparin-Toyopearl 650M, and TSK gel AF-blue-Toyopearl 650ML. CHAPS extracts were applied to TSK gel AF-red-Toyopearl 650ML, reactive red dye-affinity column (2.5-cm diameter × 9 cm), which had been pre-equilibrated with Buffer A (25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1% CHAPS, 20% ethylene glycol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 0.1 mg/ml azolectin). The column was then washed with Buffer A until the effluent absorbance at 280 nm neared base-line values before elution with Buffer A containing a linear gradient of NaCl from 0 to 2 m. Fractions were assayed for acyltransferase activities. Fractions from the AF-red-Toyopearl column that showed LPIAT and LPCAT activity, eluting at around 0.5 m NaCl (see Fig. 2A, fractions 36–42), were pooled and applied to a hydroxyapatite column (1.5 × 15 cm) that was pre-equilibrated in Buffer A. The column was washed with Buffer A and then eluted with Buffer A in which the potassium phosphate concentration increased linearly from 0 to 500 mm. Fractions containing LPIAT activity, eluting at around 0.2 m potassium phosphate (see Fig. 2B, fractions 15–20), were pooled, diluted with 3 volumes of Buffer A, and applied to an Econo-Pac Q cartridge pre-equilibrated in Buffer A. The column was washed with Buffer A until the effluent absorbance neared base-line values and then eluted with Buffer A in which the NaCl concentration increased linearly from 0 to 500 mm. The flow-through fractions from the Econo-Pac Q cartridge that contained LPIAT activity (see Fig. 2C) were pooled and loaded onto a TSK gel AF-heparin-Toyopearl 650 m column (1 × 5 cm) that had been pre-equilibrated with Buffer A. The column was washed with Buffer A and eluted with the same buffer in which the NaCl concentration increased linearly from 100 to 500 mm. The fractions containing LPIAT activity were pooled, diluted, and then applied to a TSK gel AF-blue-Toyopearl 650ML column (2-ml bed volume) that had been pre-equilibrated with Buffer A. The column was washed with Buffer A in which the NaCl concentration increased linearly from 0 to 500 mm. Fractions with LPIAT activity were pooled. Most characterization of LPIAT- and CoA-dependent transacylation of LPI was done using enzyme purified through the TSK gel AF-blue-Toyopearl 650ML stage. Partially purified LPIAT (10 μg protein) was subjected to SDS-PAGE (10% acrylamide) with molecular weight markers (Low range; Bio-Rad). The gel was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. Effects of Various Reagents on LPIAT Activity and CoA-dependent Transacylation Reaction toward LPI in the Partially Purified LPIAT Fractions—Partially purified LPIAT (AF-blue-Toyopearl fractions) was treated with N-ethylmaleimide (2 mm) or 5,5′-dithiobis(nitrobenzoic acid (2 mm) for 30 min on ice. Alternatively, partially purified LPIAT was treated with azido-oleoyl-CoA (50 μm) (26Rajasekharan R. Marians R.C. Shockey J.M. Kemp J.D. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 12386-12391Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) for 30 min on ice and then irradiated with UV light (254 nm) for 2 min. The treated fractions were applied to an Ampure SA buffer-exchange column (Amersham Biosciences) to remove the reagents before enzyme assay. For treatment of purified LPIAT fractions with phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (2 mm) or 0.5% Triton X-100, the reagents were not removed but rather diluted with the assay buffer to 0.4 mm and 0.05%, respectively. In each case, the treated fractions were assayed for LPIAT activity and for CoA-dependent transacylation activity toward [3H]LPI. Expression of mLPAAT in Escherichia coli—mLPAAT tagged at the N terminus with His6 was expressed under control of tac (trc-lac) promoter in JC201 E. coli cells that lack endogenous LPAAT activity (pls C mutant) (15Yamashita A.

JC201 cells harboring pTrc/mLPAAT were cultured in LB medium at 30 °C until the A 600 reached ∼0.6 and then cultured for an additional 3 h with 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. The pTicHisC vector without an insert was used as a negative control. Bacterial cells were collected by centrifugation at 3,000 × g for 15 min and then disrupted by sonication in 0.25 m sucrose/1 mm EDTA/0.1 m Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4) containing a protease inhibitor mixture (Calbiochem). The lysate was centrifuged at 3,000 × g for 15 min to remove cell debris and then the supernatant was further centrifuged at 105,000 × g for 60 min. The resulting membrane pellet was washed with the same buffer, and the final pellet was suspended in the same buffer and used for enzyme assays. The expression of mLPAAT in E. coli was confirmed by Western blotting using a monoclonal antibody against the penta-histidine epitope (Qiagen) (15Yamashita A. Kawagishi N. Miyashita T. Nagatsuka T.

The crystal structure of DCD-DUT has been determined to 1.88-Å resolution and represents the first known structure of an enzyme catalyzing dCTP deamination. The functional form of DCD-DUT is a homotrimer wherein the subunits are composed of a central distorted β-barrel surrounded by two β-sheets and four helices. The trimeric DCD-DUT shows structural similarity to trimeric dUTPases at the tertiary and quaternary levels. There are also additional structural elements in DCD-DUT compared with dUTPase because of a longer primary structure. Four of the five conserved sequence motifs that create the active sites in dUTPase are found in structurally equivalent positions in DCD-DUT. The last 25 C-terminal residues of the 204-residue-long DCD-DUT are not visible in the electron density map, but, analogous to dUTPases, the C terminus is probably ordered, closing the active site upon catalysis. Unlike other enzymes catalyzing the deamination of cytosine compounds, DCD-DUT is not exploiting an enzyme-bound metal ion such as zinc or iron for nucleophile generation. The active site contains two water molecules that are engaged in hydrogen bonds to the invariant residues Ser118, Arg122, Thr130, and Glu145.

These water molecules are potential nucleophile candidates in the deamination reaction. dUMP is the origin of thymidine precursors for DNA in all organisms. It is the substrate of thymidylate synthase that catalyzes the formation of dTMP (1Neuhard J. Kelln R.A. Neidhardt F.C. Curtiss III, R. Ingraham J.L. Lin E.C.C. Low K.B. Magasanik B. Reznikoff W.S. Riley M. Schaechter M. Umbarger H.E. Escherichia coli and Salmonella: Cellular and Molecular Biology. ASM Press, Washington D. C.1996: 580-599Google Scholar). The main pathway for dUMP generation differs markedly between different organisms. dUMP is produced on the monophosphate level by the action of dCMP deaminase in eukaryotes and Gram-positive bacteria, whereas in Gram-negative bacteria such as Escherichia coli and some Archaea, dCTP is deaminated and dephosphorylated. dCTP deaminase (EC 3.5.4.13) and dUTPase (EC 3.6.1.23) catalyze the two consecutive steps where dUMP is formed in E. coli (dCTP → dUTP → dUMP). The hyperthermophilic archaeon Methanocaldococcus jannaschii produces a bifunctional dCTP deaminase-dUTPase (DCD-DUT) 1The abbreviations used are: DCD-DUT, bifunctional dCTP deaminase-dUTPase; NCS, non-crystallographic symmetry. with the ability to catalyze both reactions (Fig. 1) (2Björnberg O.

The gene that encodes this enzyme was first annotated as coding for a dCTP deaminase, but enzymatic studies revealed the bifunctionality, which implies that dUTP is never released from the enzyme. dUTP is also formed upon spontaneous deamination of dCTP, and the reaction catalyzed by dUTPase is therefore essential in keeping the cellular concentration of dUTP low to suppress misincorporation of uracil into DNA. If such an event would happen, DNA is restored by an inherent repair mechanism. However, when dUTPase is deficient, the organism will not survive (4El-Hajj H.H. Zhang H. Weiss B. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 1069-1075Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Gadsden M.H. McIntosh E.M. Game J.C. Wilson P.J. Haynes R.H. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4425-4431Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). The dUTPases exist in different oligomeric forms. The homotrimeric form of dUTPases is by far the most common, but there are also monomeric and homodimeric variants of the enzyme. dCTP deaminases, together with DCD-DUT from M. jannaschii, display sequence similarities to homotrimeric dUTPases (6Koonin E.V.

The four matching motifs are part of the three identical active sites in homotrimeric dUTPases, and each active site harbors motifs 1, 2, and 4 from one subunit of the trimer and motif 3 from another subunit. The third subunit of the dUTPase trimer is also part of the active site by contributing the fifth motif. This motif is located at the C terminus, which is mobile in the absence of substrate, but, upon catalysis, it closes the active site (9Nord J. Kiefer M. Adolph H.-W. Zeppezauer M.M. Nyman P.O.

Deamination of cytosine compounds also takes place in the pyrimidine salvage pathways, wherein preformed cytosine and (deoxy)cytidine is converted into uracil and (deoxy)uridine, respectively. The first of these reactions is catalyzed by cytosine deaminase, an enzyme that only is present in bacteria and fungi. Cytidine deaminase that catalyzes the second reaction is, on the other hand, present in almost all organisms, including higher eukaryotes. Deamination of a cytosine ring implies an attack by a water molecule (or hydroxide ion) and subsequent expulsion of the amino group. Cytidine deaminase, dCMP deaminase, and yeast cytosine deaminase utilize zinc ions, whereas bacterial cytosine deaminase makes use of an iron ion for formation of the nucleophilic hydroxide ion used in the reaction. dCTP deaminase has been shown to not contain any metal ions. 2J. Neuhard, unpublished results. Therefore, dCTP deaminase and the highly similar DCD-DUT must operate with a different catalytic machinery from the other enzymes studied that deaminate cytosine compounds. Nevertheless, as for dUTP hydrolysis by dUTPases, dCTP deaminase and DCD-DUT require magnesium ions in order to be catalytically active. Studies of Salmonella typhimurium dCTP deaminase suggest that the true substrate of the reaction is the magnesium-dCTP complex (13Beck C.F. Eisenhardt A.R. Neuhard J. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 609-616Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have undertaken to determine the structure of DCD-DUT from M. jannaschii to obtain information on the structural relationship of this enzyme and the homotrimeric dUTPases, of which there are crystal structures available from five different organisms (11Mol C.D.

Moreover, the DCD-DUT structure provides information about the mechanism for generation of the nucleophile in this type of deaminase.

Crystals used for diffraction experiments were grown at 20 °C with a hanging drop of 2 μl of 3 mg/ml protein in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, mixed with 2 μl mother liquor (5% PEG 8000, 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH8.5) equilibrated over 1 ml of mother liquor. The crystals grew to a size of 0.3 × 0.3 × 0.3 mm in 3 days. The heavy atom derivative crystal was obtained by the addition of 2 mm lead acetate in the mother liquor. Data Collection—Diffraction data were collected under cryogenic conditions (100 K) at beamline I711, MAX-lab, Lund university, Sweden (17Cerenius Y. Ståhl K. Svensson L.A. Ursby T. Oskarsson Å. Albertsson J. Liljas A. J. Synchrotron Radiat. 2000; 7: 203-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) on a MAR Research CCD detector. One hour prior to data collection, the crystal was transferred to mother liquor to which ethylene glycol had been added to 25% for cryo protection. Auto indexing, data reduction, and scaling were performed with programs from the HKL suite (18Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar). The crystals belong to the cubic space group P213 (a = b = c = 111.1 Å), and two protein chains per asymmetric unit give a reasonable Mathews coefficient of 2.44 Å3/Da, corresponding to ∼50% solvent content. Structure Determination and Refinement—The three-dimensional structure was determined using the method of single isomorphous replacement with anomalous scattering. The wavelength of the data collection (1.098 Å) was not ideal for obtaining an optimal anomalous signal from lead, but, nonetheless, the positions of two lead atoms were found with the program SOLVE (19Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3220) Google Scholar), which may be attributed to the high redundancy and accuracy of the data. RESOLVE (20Terwilliger T.C. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 1863-1871Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) was used for density modification and automatic tracing. The phases were extended from 2.5-Å resolution (lead derivative) to 1.88-Å resolution (native data) using the ARP-wARP program (21Lamzin V.S. Perrakis A. Wilson K.S. Rossmann M.G. Arnold E. International Tables for Crystallography: Crystallography of Biological Macromolecules. Vol. F. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The, Netherlands2001: 720-722Google Scholar), and a free atom model was produced. From this model, 97% of the 356 amino acid residues contained in the final model could be automatically traced by ARP-wARP. After one step of refinement with REFMAC5 (22Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13914) Google Scholar), the remaining amino acid residues of the model were manually built in O (23Jones T.A. Zou J. Cowan S. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13014) Google Scholar). Cycles of refinement with REFMAC5 and water picking with ARP-wARP (21Lamzin V.S. Perrakis A. Wilson K.S. Rossmann M.G. Arnold E. International Tables for Crystallography: Crystallography of Biological Macromolecules. Vol. F. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The, Netherlands2001: 720-722Google Scholar) were performed. During refinement, non-crystallographic symmetry (NCS) restraints were applied to the two molecules in the asymmetric unit, water molecules related by NCS were detected with WATNCS (24Collaborative Computational Project Number 4Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar), and these were also added to the NCS restraints. The quality of the model was checked with PROCHECK (25Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar) and WHATIF (26Hooft R.W.W. Vriend G. Sander C. Abola E.E. Nature. 1996; 381 (272): 272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1818) Google Scholar) as refinement progressed. The structure factors and coordinates have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank with accession code 1OGH. Sequence Alignment—Structure-based sequence alignment (Fig. 4) was performed with the INDONESIA program package (alpha2.bmc.uu.se/~dennis/). 3D. Madsen, P. Johansson, and G. J. Kleywegt, manuscript in preparation. The sequence alignment in the supplementary material (Fig. 5) was prepared with T-Coffee (27Notredame C. Higgins D. Heringa J. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 302: 205-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (5514) Google Scholar). Structure Determination—The structure of DCD-DUT from M. jannaschii was solved by single isomorphous replacement with anomalous scattering using a lead derivative. The quality of the initial electron density map was sufficient for automatic tracing of most residues of the final model. The model was refined to an R-factor of 14.6% (R free = 18.4%).

Open table in a new tab The subunit in homotrimeric DCD-DUT is composed of 204 amino acid residues with a molecular mass of 23.4 kDa. The asymmetric unit in the crystal contains two subunits (chain A and B) forming two independent homotrimers by the crystallographic 3-fold symmetry. The A chain is composed of residues A 1–175 and the B chain of residues B 1–181, respectively. Of the 356 amino acid residues, 18 were modeled with double conformations of their side chains. Although there is clear electron-density for all amino acid residues in the model that could be refined to low R-values, the remaining C-terminal residues (A 176–204 and B 182–204) could not to be localized in the electron-density map. The Cα-atoms (1–175) of the two chains can be superimposed with a root mean square deviation of 0.30 Å using default parameters in the program O (23Jones T.A. Zou J. Cowan S. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13014) Google Scholar). The model also contains 400 water molecules, of which 192 are related by NCS. In the Ramachandran plot there are no non-glycine residues in disfavored regions except for residues Lys20 and Pro21, which form a cis-peptide bond. This proline residue is strongly conserved among dCTP deaminase amino acid sequences (Fig. 5, supplementary material). Overall Fold—The subunit of DCD-DUT from M. jannaschii is composed of 13 β-strands (β1–β13), 3 α-helices (α1–α3), and one 310-helix (γ1) (Fig. 2, a and c). These are arranged in a structure of mainly β-structural character with one mixed β-sheet and three anti-parallel β-sheets, of which two (S1 and S2) form a distorted β-barrel (Fig. 2a). The N terminus starts with one long α-helix and goes further into β1, a β-strand in the first curled anti-parallel β-sheet (S1) that also contains β7, β11, and β9. After one turn of 310-helix, the second anti-parallel β-sheet (S2) with β-strands β2, β13, β8, and β10 is initiated. These two β-sheets (S1 and S2) form the distorted anti-parallel β-barrel. From β2, the protein chain continues into β3 and β4, which form an extruding anti-parallel β-arm (S3) with a long loop connecting the two strands. Succeeding β4 is β5, which is the central β-strand surrounded by β12 and β6 in the mixed β-sheet S4. A long α-helix (α2) is inserted between β5 and β6in this β-sheet. After β6, the protein chain contributes to β-sheet S1 and S2 with β7–β11. α3 is inserted between β8 and β9 of β-sheets S2 and S1, respectively. From β11, the protein chain continues into β-sheet S4 with β12, and, finally, β13 finishes β-sheet S2. The subunits related by crystallographic 3-fold symmetry give rise to a homotrimeric structure, the presumed active form of the enzyme (Fig. 2b). The surface perpendicular to the 3-fold axis has an equilaterally triangular shape with a side of ∼40 Å. The thickness of the trimer along the 3-fold axis is 50 Å. The N-terminal residues of the three subunits are buried in the interior of the trimer, whereas the C-terminal residues extrude in the solvent region. The last five residues from chain B in the model form an additional β-strand on the β-arm S3 of the A-chain (A 56–61) in the crystal. These interactions are not part of the homotrimer contacts and may be considered a crystal-packing artifact. The long loop between β3 and β4 intrudes into the next subunit forming an important intersubunit interaction. An analysis of the interactions of two of the subunits in the trimer with the Protein-Protein Interaction Server (28Jones S. Thornton J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (2289) Google Scholar) gives a value of 1677 Å2 for the interface-accessible surface area with residues from eight different segments. 65 and 35% of the residues in the surface are non-polar and polar, respectively. The analysis was performed including all the NCS-related water molecules in the asymmetric unit, and, of these, 79 form bridges between the subunits. Structural Similarity to Homotrimeric dUTPases— Fig. 3a shows the superimposition of one subunit of DCD-DUT from M. jannaschii and dUTPase from feline immunodeficiency virus (12Prasad G.S. Stura E.A. Elder J.H. Stout C.D. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2000; 56: 1100-1109Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), respectively. This dUTPase structure has been chosen as an illustration because it has an ordered C terminus. The two crystal structures superimpose with a root mean square deviation of 1.8 Å for 92 Cα atoms as determined using default parameters in the program O (23Jones T.A. Zou J. Cowan S. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13014) Google Scholar). Panels b and d in Fig. 2 display schematics of the same trimers in equivalent views. There are additional structural features in the DCD-DUT structure, as reflected by its additional 71 amino acid residues. This is made clearer in the topology diagrams in Fig. 3, b and c as well as in the structure based sequence alignment in Fig. 4 where the crystal structures of five dUTPases of different origins have been superimposed with the DCD-DUT structure. Structural elements, which are present in DCD-DUT but not in dUTPase, are the anti-parallel β-arm S3 and α-helices α1 and α2. The N-terminal α1 lies on top of the homotrimer as seen in the view of Fig. 2b. The β-arm S3, with β3 and β4 and their interjacent loop, gives rise to additional trimerization interactions, and the long α-helix α2 and β-strand β6 generate an extension of DCD-DUT along the 3-fold axis of the trimer, as compared with dUTPases. Active Site—There are several crystal structures in the Protein Data Bank of dUTPases in complex with dUMP, dUDP, or dUTP, which all map to the same position in the trimer as illustrated in Fig. 2d. Fig. 2e shows a close-up of the presumed active site of DCD-DUT with dUDP and a strontium ion from the superimposed equine infectious anemia virus dUTPase (PDB code 1DUC). This structure has been chosen because it is the only one where a metal ion is bound in the active site (15Dauter Z. Persson R. Rosengren A.M. Nyman P.O. Wilson K.S. Cedergren-Zeppezauer E.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 655-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Like dUTPases, DCD-DUT requires a divalent metal ion such as magnesium to be active. dUDP and the strontium ion can be contained in DCD-DUT without any clashes with the protein. The binding site for the pyrimidine ring is occupied by two well ordered water molecules (w359 and w361). Residues from two of the subunits of the trimers contribute to the active site in DCD-DUT, as illustrated in Fig. 2e. Among these residues, three are conserved in dCTP deaminases but not in dUTPases, namely Arg122, Thr130, and Glu145 (Fig. 4) (Fig. 5, supplementary material). In the active site, residue Phe138 seems to serve the same role as the corresponding residue in dUTPases, which is predominantly a tyrosine residue. The ring of this residue stacks with the deoxyribose moiety of the substrate (Fig. 2e). In a few cases, for example in the mouse mammary tumor virus dUTPase, this residue is also a phenylalanine (29Björnberg O. Nyman P.O. J. Gen. Virol. 1996; 77: 3107-3111Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) and, in other dCTP deaminases, it is a tryptophan residue, which agrees with the stacking ability. The overall fold of DCD-DUT is similar to homotrimeric dUTPases, although DCD-DUT harbors additional structural features (Fig. 3). The position of the active site could be localized based on superimpositions of DCD-DUT with structures of dUTPases of different origins (Fig. 2e). Four of the conserved regions from dUTPase sequence alignments are also found in the dCTP sequences (Fig. 5, supplementary material). The sequence conservation of motif 1 is less pronounced than those for the other three, but the structural correspondence of this motif is still unambiguous. Two of the motifs (2 and 3) are most likely, as is the case in dUTPase, involved in base and sugar recognition as well as phosphate binding. The other two motifs (1 and 4) are found in a farther end of the substrate binding region, also in a similar way as is the case with dUTPases. The fifth conserved sequence motif in the dUTPases (motif 5), located in the C terminus, is not preserved in dCTP deaminases. However, the C-terminal region in dCTP deaminases contains a different amino acid sequence (residues 184–190 in M. jannaschii DCD-DUT) (Fig. 5, supplementary material). These conserved residues could be involved in closing the active site as has been shown for dUTPases (9Nord J. Kiefer M. Adolph H.-W. Zeppezauer M.M. Nyman P.O. FEBS Lett. 2000; 472: 312-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 10Nord J. Nyman P.O. Larsson G. Drakenberg T. FEBS Lett. 2001; 432: 228-232Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 11Mol C.D. Harris J.M. McIntosh E.M. Tainer J.A. Structure. 1996; 4: 1077-1092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 12Prasad G.S. Stura E.A. Elder J.H. Stout C.D. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2000; 56: 1100-1109Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The C terminus is indeed required for activity of DCD-DUT, as has been found for a C-terminally truncated form of the enzyme (2Björnberg O. Neuhard J. Nyman P.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20667-20672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The trimer interface in DCD-DUT contains only a few invariant residues among dCTP deaminases (Asp49, Leu97, Thr130, and Glu145 in M. jannaschii DCD-DUT). Therefore, the nature of the interaction with 65% non-polar and 35% polar residues with 79 bridging water molecules for M. jannaschii DCD-DUT may not be typical for dCTP deaminases. A similar trend is observed in the dUTPases, wherein the character of the subunit interactions varies from exclusively hydrophobic (E. coli dUTPase) to alternating layers of positively and negatively charged residues that contain numerous water molecules (human dUTPase) (30Persson R. Cedergren-Zeppezauer E.S. Wilson K.S. Curr. Protein Pept. Sci. 2001; 2: 287-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). dUTPases contain a proline residue that is considered to be a hinge, which is important for correct bending of the C-terminal tail so that it reaches all over the trimer to the correct active site (Fig. 2d) (31Bergdoll M. Remy M.-H. Cagnon C. Masson J.-M. Dumas P. Structure. 1997; 5: 391-401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). No such curvature is observed in the structure of M. jannaschii DCD-DUT, where the last visible residues in the C terminus continue in a relatively straight line (Fig. 2b). This may not represent the conformation in solution, and, as mentioned previously, the β-strand formed by the last residues in the C terminus of protein chain B may be regarded as a crystal-packing artifact. There are no indications that the C terminus of DCD-DUT could not cross around the adjacent subunit of the trimer and reach the active site farthest away, as is the case for dUTPases (Fig. 2d). On the other hand, the number of amino acid residues in the C terminus is even sufficient for going in the other direction (counterclockwise in Fig. 2b) and reaching the third active site. The cis-peptide bond between Lys20 and Pro21 in DCD-DUT is placed at the end of β-strand β1 before the peptide chain enters the 310-helix γ1. The bond is placed on the protein surface and, though there is no obvious reason for its presence, it may be involved in interactions with the C terminus upon catalysis. In motif 3, the aspartate residue corresponding to Asp135 is strictly conserved in dUTPases and strongly conserved between the dCTP deaminases (Fig. 5, supplementary material). Crystal structures of dUTPases complexed with substrate analogues show that the carboxylate group of this aspartate is hydrogen bonded to the 3-hydroxy group of deoxyribose. In the dUTPase from E. coli in complex with dUDP, this carboxylate group (Asp90) also interacts with a water molecule, appropriately positioned for a nucleophilic in-line attack on the α-phosphate. It has therefore been suggested that this residue may act as a general base in dUTP hydrolysis. Site-directed mutagenesis of the residue in other dUTPases has consistently generated an inactive enzyme (32Steagall W.K. Robek M.D. Perry S.T. Fuller F.J. Payne S.L. Virology. 1995; 210: 302-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 33Harris J.M. McIntosh E.M. Muscat E.O. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 288: 275-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In DCD-DUT, Asp135 was recently mutated to an asparagine residue by Li et al. (3Li H. Xu H. Graham D.E. White R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 11100-11106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), and this enzyme had neither deaminase nor dUTPase activity. Whether the residue is essential for catalysis or substrate binding or both remains to be answered, as an aspartate or glutamate residue is also found at this position in monofunctional dCTP deaminases. A crucial role as general acid/base catalyst has been ascribed to a glutamic acid residue in cytidine deaminases, namely Glu104 in dimeric cytidine deaminase from E. coli (34Betts L. Xiang S. Short S.A. Wolfenden R. Carter Jr., C.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 635-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar) and Glu55 in tetrameric cytidine deaminase from Bacillus subtilis (35Johansson E. Mejlhede N. Neuhard J. Larsen S. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 2563-2670Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The structures of these enzymes were determined using transition state analogues of cytidine with a hydroxyl group attached to a tetrahedral C4 atom. Assisted by a firmly bound zinc atom, the glutamate residue is supposed to be involved in both the generation of the nucleophilic hydroxide ion and the protonation of N3. Li and co-workers have mutated the strongly conserved Glu145 to glutamine in DCD-DUT (3Li H. Xu H. Graham D.E. White R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 11100-11106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The mutant enzyme was devoid of deaminase activity but showed 25% residual dUTPase activity. Glu145 may have a role analogous to that of the residue in cytidine deaminases, because it is found in the active site close to the plausible position of the pyrimidine ring (Fig. 2e). In cytidine deaminases, dCMP deaminases, and cytosine deaminases, a metal ion such as zinc or iron is used for water activation prior to the nucleophilic attack. dCTP deaminase and DCD-DUT do not contain any metal ions, as has been examined by energy dispersive x-ray fluorescence for dCTP deaminase from E. coli 2 and seen in the crystal structure described here. Hence, formation of the nucleophile that performs the attack on the C4 atom of the pyrimidine ring must occur in a different way. The region of the active site in DCD-DUT, where the deamination reaction is assumed to take place, contains a network of hydrogen bonds involving well defined water molecules and the side chains of five amino acid residues, Ser118, Arg122, His128, Thr130, and Glu145 (Fig. 2f). All of these amino acid residues, except for His128, are invariant among dCTP deaminases (Fig. 5, supplementary material). His128 is substituted by an asparagine residue in some dCTP deaminases, a replacement that may preserve the hydrogen bonding abilities of the histidine residue. There is a very narrow pocket formed by motif 3 in homotrimeric dUTPases, where the O4 atom of uracil is hydrogen bonded to a water molecule that is held in place by hydrogen bonds to main chain atoms (11Mol C.D. Harris J.M. McIntosh E.M. Tainer J.A. Structure. 1996; 4: 1077-1092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 30Persson R. Cedergren-Zeppezauer E.S. Wilson K.S. Curr. Protein Pept. Sci. 2001; 2: 287-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In DCD-DUT, the His128 side chain occupies the position equivalent to this water molecule, but, nevertheless, binding of uracil is possible (Fig. 2e). The active site (Fig. 2f) contains three water molecules, i.e. w326, w350, and w359. Both w326 and w359 are hydrogen bonded to residues that are strictly conserved among the dCTP deaminases, which make them candidates as nucleophiles for the deamination reaction. w359 is hydrogen bonded to a positively charged side chain (Arg122), which could favor its tendency toward deprotonization and conversion to a hydroxyl group. However, it is also hydrogen bonded to Glu145, which counterbalances the positive charge. If Glu145 interacts with the pyrimidine ring, as in cytidine deaminase (34Betts L. Xiang S. Short S.A. Wolfenden R. Carter Jr., C.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 635-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar, 35Johansson E. Mejlhede N. Neuhard J. Larsen S. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 2563-2670Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), this could also favor the conversion of w359 to a nucleophilic hydroxyl ion. Binding of the substrate may perturb the dynamic hydrogen bonding network, altering the positions of the protons. The structure of the enzyme in complex with an inhibitor or product is required to resolve this issue and may give structural information on the role of the flexible C terminus. The structure of DCD-DUT has confirmed that this bifunctional enzyme is not a fusion protein of a dCTP deaminase and a dUTPase. The evolutionary aspect of whether the bifunctional enzyme evolved before or after the dUTPases remains an open question.

https://openalex.org/W2107544427,"trans-Translation is an unusual translation in which tmRNA plays a dual function as a tRNA and an mRNA to relieve the stalled translation on the ribosome. In this study, we examined the effects of an aminoglycoside antibiotic, paromomycin, on several tmRNA-related events in vitro. The results of a chemical footprinting study indicated that paromomycin molecules bind tmRNA at G332/G333 in the tRNA domain and A316 in the middle of the long helix between tRNA and mRNA domains. Paromomycin bound at G332/G333 inhibited aminoacylation, and the inhibition was suppressed by the addition of SmpB, a tmRNA-binding protein. It was also found that paromomycin causes a shift of the translation resuming point on tmRNA by –1. The effect on initiation shift was canceled by a mutation at the paromomycin-binding site in 16 S rRNA but not by mutations in tmRNA. A high concentration of paromomycin inhibited trans-translation, whereas it enhanced the initiation-shifted trans-translation when SmpB was exogenously added or a mutation was introduced at 333. The effect of paromomycin on trans-translation differs substantially from that on canonical translation, in which it induces miscoding by modulating the A site of the decoding helix of the small subunit RNA of the ribosome."
https://openalex.org/W2011830112,"In this study we used site-directed mutagenesis to test the hypothesis that substrate channeling in the bifunctional thymidylate synthase-dihydrofolate reductase enzyme from Leishmania major occurs via electrostatic interactions between the negatively charged dihydrofolate produced at thymidylate synthase and a series of lysine and arginine residues on the surface of the protein. Accordingly, 12 charge reversal or charge neutralization mutants were made, with up to 6 putative channel residues changed at once. The mutants were assessed for impaired channeling using two criteria: a lag in product formation at dihydrofolate reductase and an increase in dihydrofolate accumulation. Surprisingly, none of the mutations produced changes consistent with impaired channeling, so our findings do not support the electrostatic channeling hypothesis. Burst experiments confirmed that the mutants also did not interfere with intermediate formation at thymidylate synthase. One mutant, K282E/R283E, was found to be thymidylate synthase-dead because of an impaired ability to form the covalent enzyme-methylene tetrahydrofolate-deoxyuridate complex prerequisite for chemical catalysis. In this study we used site-directed mutagenesis to test the hypothesis that substrate channeling in the bifunctional thymidylate synthase-dihydrofolate reductase enzyme from Leishmania major occurs via electrostatic interactions between the negatively charged dihydrofolate produced at thymidylate synthase and a series of lysine and arginine residues on the surface of the protein. Accordingly, 12 charge reversal or charge neutralization mutants were made, with up to 6 putative channel residues changed at once. The mutants were assessed for impaired channeling using two criteria: a lag in product formation at dihydrofolate reductase and an increase in dihydrofolate accumulation. Surprisingly, none of the mutations produced changes consistent with impaired channeling, so our findings do not support the electrostatic channeling hypothesis. Burst experiments confirmed that the mutants also did not interfere with intermediate formation at thymidylate synthase. One mutant, K282E/R283E, was found to be thymidylate synthase-dead because of an impaired ability to form the covalent enzyme-methylene tetrahydrofolate-deoxyuridate complex prerequisite for chemical catalysis. Electrostatic channeling is a mechanism proposed based on the crystal structure of bifunctional thymidylate synthase-dihydrofolate reductase (TS-DHFR) 1The abbreviations used are: TS-DHFR, thymidylate synthase-dihydrofolate reductase bifunctional enzyme (this is a functional designation as dihydrofolate is produced at TS and used at DHFR; elsewhere the bifunctional enzyme is referred to as DHFR-TS because DHFR resides at the N-terminal portion of the bifunctional protein); CH2H4folate, methylene tetrahydrofolate; dTMP, 2′-deoxythymidylate; dUMP, 2′-deoxyuridate; FdUMP, 5-fluorodeoxyuridine-5′-monophosphate; FRET, fluorescence resonance energy transfer; Hsfolate, dihydrofolate; H4folate, tetrahydrofolate; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; PDDF, 10 propargyl 1–5,8-dideazafolate.1The abbreviations used are: TS-DHFR, thymidylate synthase-dihydrofolate reductase bifunctional enzyme (this is a functional designation as dihydrofolate is produced at TS and used at DHFR; elsewhere the bifunctional enzyme is referred to as DHFR-TS because DHFR resides at the N-terminal portion of the bifunctional protein); CH2H4folate, methylene tetrahydrofolate; dTMP, 2′-deoxythymidylate; dUMP, 2′-deoxyuridate; FdUMP, 5-fluorodeoxyuridine-5′-monophosphate; FRET, fluorescence resonance energy transfer; Hsfolate, dihydrofolate; H4folate, tetrahydrofolate; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; PDDF, 10 propargyl 1–5,8-dideazafolate. from Leishmania major that would enable negatively charged dihydrofolate produced at the TS active site to be handed off along a series of solvent-exposed lysine and arginine residues to the DHFR active site, where it is converted to tetrahydrofolate (H4folate) (1Knighton D.R. Kan C.-C. Howland E. Janson C.A. Hostomska Z. Welsh K.M. Matthews D.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 186-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). TS and DHFR are crucial enzymes, found in all species. TS represents the only means of de novo synthesis of 2′-deoxythymidylate (dTMP) for DNA synthesis, via reductive methylation of 2′-deoxyuridate (dUMP) with methylene tetrahydrofolate (CH2H4folate), producing dihydrofolate (H2folate) in the process. DHFR catalyzes the reduction of H2folate by NADPH to generate H4folate, used for one carbon unit transfer reactions in several biochemical processes, including thymidylate, purine, and amino acid biosynthesis. Only in protozoal parasites and some plants however, are TS and DHFR found on the same polypeptide chain, leading to the hypothesis that in these organisms, H2folate may be channeled from the TS active site to that of DHFR, never equilibrating with bulk solution (Fig. 1A). When the crystal structure of L. major TS-DHFR was solved (2.9 Å resolution), a 40 Å “electrostatic highway” across the surface of the protein was proposed as an explanation for how channeling may occur (1Knighton D.R. Kan C.-C. Howland E. Janson C.A. Hostomska Z. Welsh K.M. Matthews D.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 186-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 2Stroud R.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 131-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). We sought to test the electrostatic channeling hypothesis with two parallel approaches. In this report we present results of mutagenesis of solvent-exposed basic residues comprising the electrostatic highway. In an earlier paper, we reported the findings from targeted molecular docking searches to identify small molecule inhibitors that bind in this region, as a means to block the putative channel (3Atreya C.E.

There are precedents for channeling among bifunctional enzymes, of which tryptophan synthase from Salmonella typhimurium is one of the best characterized examples (4Hyde C.C. Ahmed S.A. Padlan E.A.

Tryptophan synthase is an α2β2 enzyme complex: the α subunit catalyzes the aldolytic cleavage of indole-3-glycerol phosphate to indole and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, whereas the β subunit catalyzes the condensation of indole with serine to form tryptophan. Solution of the crystal structure of tryptophan synthase from S. typhimurium revealed a 25 Å hydrophobic tunnel connecting the active sites (4Hyde C.C. Ahmed S.A. Padlan E.A. Miles E.W. Davies D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17857-17871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). There is also kinetic evidence for a conformational change following formation of the aminoacrylate intermediate at the β subunit, which accelerates the rate of catalysis at the α subunit by ∼150-fold (6Anderson K.S. Miles E.W. Johnson K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8020-8033Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Buildup of indole is only observed in single enzyme turnover of the αβ reaction when channeling is obstructed by site-directed mutagenesis (7Anderson K.S. Kim A.Y. Quillen J.M. Sayers E. Yang X.-J. Miles E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29936-29944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 8Schlichting I. Yang X.-J. Miles E.W. Kim A.Y. Anderson K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26591-26593Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although there is no obvious hydrophobic tunnel through L. major TS-DHFR, there is kinetic evidence for substrate channeling, notably the absence of a lag in product formation at DHFR and a lack of buildup of H2folate (11Meek T.D. Garvey E.P. Santi D.V. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 678-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 12Liang P.-H. Anderson K.S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 12195-12205Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Also similar to tryptophan synthase, in bifunctional TS-DHFR, the second enzyme (DHFR) is faster than the first (TS), and there is evidence for domain-domain communication (12Liang P.-H. Anderson K.S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 12195-12205Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Steady-state kinetics indicates that there is a lag in formation of the products of the DHFR reaction (NADP and H4folate) when monofunctional TS and DHFR enzymes are combined, but not in the case of bifunctional TS-DHFR from Leishmania tropica (11Meek T.D. Garvey E.P. Santi D.V. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 678-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). This suggests that in the case of the bifunctional enzyme only, H2folate produced at the TS site is transferred directly to the DHFR site, rather than first equilibrating in bulk solvent. Direct evidence for substrate channeling has been obtained by transient kinetic analysis. It was shown by rapid chemical quench that in single enzyme turnover experiments with L. major, there is no lag in H4folate production, and little H2folate accumulation is observed, again suggesting direct transfer of H2folate from TS to DHFR (12Liang P.-H. Anderson K.S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 12195-12205Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Prior to this report there was no direct evidence for electrostatic guidance of H2folate as the mechanism by which channeling occurs. There are, however, precedents for electrostatic steering in other enzyme systems (13Koppenol W.H. Margoliash E. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 16049-16058Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of L. major TS-DHFR revealed that the two active sites are located on the same face of the protein, separated by a distance of 40 Å. Because H2folate has a charge of –2 and polyglutamylated folate substrates found in nature are even more highly negatively charged, distribution of positively charged amino acids (lysine and arginine) on the surface of TS-DHFR was examined. This elucidated a highly positively charged electrostatic potential surface forming the solvent-exposed path connecting TS and DHFR, with a generally negatively charged surrounding surface (1Knighton D.R. Kan C.-C. Howland E. Janson C.A. Hostomska Z. Welsh K.M. Matthews D.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 186-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). In the TS domain, contributors to the positively charged potential are Lys-282, Arg-283, and Arg-287, conserved in all TS species. DHFR is much less conserved than TS, and in the DHFR domain of the L. major bifunctional enzyme there is a 12-amino acid loop not present in Escherichia coli; 6 of these residues are positively charged. The positively charged residues, Lys-66, 67, 72, and 73, and Arg-64 and 74, are solvent-exposed and also take part in the putative channel (Fig. 1B). TS is connected to DHFR by a very short tether; it is predicted that torsional rotation of Arg-287 would position its side chain 10–12 Å from that of Lys-73 in the DHFR domain (1Knighton D.R. Kan C.-C. Howland E. Janson C.A. Hostomska Z. Welsh K.M. Matthews D.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 186-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Brownian dynamics simulation also predicts that in the presence of electrostatic effects, 95% of substrate with charge –2 exiting the TS site would reach the DHFR site, whereas only 6% of substrate would channel in the absence of electrostatics (13Koppenol W.H. Margoliash E. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 4426-4437Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although the primary goal of this research was to determine whether solvent-exposed basic residues in the shallow groove region of TS-DHFR participate in electrostatic channeling of H2folate, an ancillary goal was to use TS pre-steady-state burst experiments to ascertain whether these same residues might mediate domain-domain communication, or conformational changes induced upon ligand binding at one active site affect activity at the active site of the other enzyme. One conformational change that is known to occur involves TS catalysis: following ordered substrate binding (dUMP then CH2H4folate), the C terminus of TS closes over the substrates to create an active site cavity shielded from solvent (20Spencer H.T.

Carreras C.W. Chang L.C. Santi D.V. Stroud R.M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7116-7125Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). It is thought that this is followed by the formation of an iminium ion involving the bridge methylene and N4 of CH2H4folate (25Perry K.M. Carreras C.W. Chang L.C. Santi D.V. Stroud R.M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7116-7125Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). We showed previously, using the wild-type enzyme, that there is a burst in consumption of the cofactor, CH2H4folate, at TS (26Johnson E.F. Hinz W. Atreya C.E. Maley F. Anderson K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43126-43136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Because it is known that chemistry is rate-limiting at TS, the observation of a burst in CH2H4folate consumption signals the accumulation of a TS intermediate, likely the iminium form of CH2H4folate (22Matthews D.A. Appelt K. Oatley S.J. Xuong N.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 214: 923-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 23Montfort W.R. Perry K.M. Fauman E.B. Finer-Moore J.S. Maley G.F. Hardy L. Maley F.

If electrostatic guidance, either via diffuse field effects or by an ordered hand-off mechanism, does account for channeling, or if the basic residues are crucial for domain-domain communication, the channel region could serve as a new drug target in parasites. Targeting the channel between the TS and DHFR in bifunctional enzymes has the potential to produce more specific therapies, with fewer side effects than traditional active site-directed medications, for protozoal diseases including malaria and toxoplasmosis. Previously reported results with eosin B signify an important step toward establishing proof of the principle that the putative channel region of TS-DHFR can serve as a molecular target that when inhibited, results in parasite death (3Atreya C.E. Johnson E.F. Irwin J.J. Dow A. Massimine K.M. Coppens I. Stempliuk V. Beverley S. Joiner K.A. Shoichet B.K. Anderson K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14092-14100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In this report we probe the electrostatic channel hypothesis by mutation of solvent-exposed basic residues predicted to participate in channeling. These TS-DHFR channel mutants are assessed for impaired channeling using two criteria: a lag in product formation at DHFR and increased H2folate accumulation. In addition, pre-steady-state burst experiments are used to examine effects on TS catalysis, and one interesting mutant is investigated further. Chemicals—All buffers and other reagents employed were of the highest chemical purity. Millipore ultrapure water was used for all solutions. CH2H4folate and H2folate were purchased from Schircks Laboratories (Switzerland). H4folate was synthesized by reduction of folic acid with sodium borohydride. Tritium-labeled H2folate and CH2H4folate were synthesized using tritiated folic acid as a starting material. The [3′,5′-7,9-3H]folic acid as well as 14C-labeled dUMP and FdUMP (5-fluorodeoxyuridine-5′-[2-14C]monophosphate) were obtained from Moravek Biochemicals (Brea, CA). Tritium-labeled H2folate was chemically prepared from the reduction of folate by sodium hydrosulfite (27Blakley R.L. Nature. 1960; 188: 231-232Crossref Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Tritiated CH2H4folate was prepared enzymatically: tritium-labeled H2folate was converted to tritiated H4folate by L. major TS-DHFR + NADPH (DHFR reaction) and condensed with formaldehyde to form CH2H4folate. The natural (6R)-l-CH2H4folate enantiomer was purified by DE52 anion exchange chromatography (Whatman Co.) and used exclusively in the studies. H2folate and CH2H4folate solutions were stored in argon purged vials at –80 °C. NADPH and dUMP were purchased from Sigma; the concentration of NADPH was determined by using a molar extinction coefficient of 6,220 m–1 cm–1 at 340 nm. Enzyme—The clone of the wild-type bifunctional TS-DHFR enzyme from L. major was a generous gift from C.-C. Kan and D. Matthews, then at Agouron Pharmaceuticals. This clone, harboring the pO2CLSA-4 plasmid in an E. coli Rue 10 expression vector, was used to obtain protein of high purity (>99%) using methods described previously for purification (28Grumont R. Sirawaraporn W. Santi D.V. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 3776-3784Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The wild-type protein has both TS and DHFR activities similar to those reported previously (11Meek T.D. Garvey E.P. Santi D.V. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 678-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 28Grumont R. Sirawaraporn W. Santi D.V. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 3776-3784Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 29Grumont R. Washtein W.L. Caput D. Santi D.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 5387-5391Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Mutations were made using a QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Plasmids containing the desired mutations, as confirmed by nucleic acid sequencing, were used to transform competent BL21 E. coli cells. Preliminary enzyme activity assays were conducted on small scale and full scale growths prior to purification. Large growths, typically 22 liters, were necessary to obtain sufficient protein from the more impaired mutants. Mutation of Lys-73 or Arg-74 led to very low yields of active enzyme (0–0.5 mg/liter) and large amounts of insoluble enzyme by gel analysis of the cell pellet (data not shown). Mutant proteins were purified in a manner similar to that for wild-type. Enzyme Concentrations—The TS-DHFR protein concentration was estimated spectrophotometrically at 280 nm using an extinction coefficient of 67,800 m–1cm–1. To rule out the possibility that differences in rates between wild-type and mutant enzymes were a result of having different numbers of functional active sites at the same protein concentration, TS active site titrations were performed. 1 μm 10-propargyl-5,8-dideazafolate (PDDF), a folate analog that binds at the TS active site, was titrated with enzyme, and the change in intensity of a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) peak at 396 nm was recorded on a SLM 4800 fluorometer (Urbana, IL) with the excitation set at 280 nm. Active site titrations were carried out by adding enzyme in small aliquots to minimize any dilution effects and with constant stirring in a 3-ml quartz cuvette at 25 °C. Fluorescence measurements were recorded as an average of four 10-s readings within 15–30 s of enzyme addition, and the recorded fluorescence intensities were corrected for dilution (29Grumont R. Washtein W.L. Caput D. Santi D.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 5387-5391Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The inflection point of the curve, obtained by plotting intensity versus enzyme concentration, approximates the amount of enzyme required to fully bind 1 μm PDDF, 1 μm wild-type L. major TS-DHFR, R64Q/R283E, and K282E/R283E fully bound 1 μm PDDF. When the starting concentration of PDDF was doubled (2 μm), the inflection point occurred when 2 μm wild-type L. major TS-DHFR had been added (Fig. 2). Enzyme Activity Assays—The DHFR activity was determined by following the decrease in absorbance at 340 nm which accompanies the conversion of substrates NADPH and H2folate to products NADP and H4folate (= –12.8 mm–1 cm–1) as described previously. The TS activity was monitored by following the increase in absorbance at 340 nm which accompanies the conversion of substrates dUMP and CH2H4folate to dTMP and H2folate (= 6.4 mm–1 cm–1) (8Schlichting I. Yang X.-J. Miles E.W. Kim A.Y. Anderson K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26591-26593Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Steady-state Spectroscopic Assays—The steady-state reaction was monitored spectroscopically using a procedure similar to that in Meek et al. (11Meek T.D. Garvey E.P. Santi D.V. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 678-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), who observed a lag in formation of the products of the DHFR reaction (NADP and H4folate) when monofunctional TS and DHFR enzymes are combined, but not in the case of bifunctional TS-DHFR from L. tropica, suggesting that in the case of the bifunctional enzyme only H2folate produced at the TS site is transferred directly to the DHFR site. The predicted change in absorbance is very small, therefore a 10-cm path length quartz observation cell was used to enhance sensitivity. The assay mixture (25 ml) containing buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.8, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm H2CO, 75 mm β-mercaptoethanol), 10 nm enzyme, and 28 μm CH2H4folate was incubated with 20 μm NADPH until the A 340 stabilized, indicating enzymatic consumption of endogenous traces of H2folate. The reaction was then initiated with 100 μm dUMP (final concentration), and the decrease in NADPH absorbance at 340 nm was monitored in the absence of added H2folate. Experiments were performed using a PerkinElmer Lambda 2 UV-visible spectrophotometer and running PECSS (PerkinElmer computerized spectroscopy software) version 4.0. Rapid Chemical Quench Experiments—The rapid quench experiments were performed using a Kintek RFQ-3 Rapid Chemical Quench Apparatus (Kintek Instruments, Austin, TX). The single enzyme turnover reaction was initiated by mixing the 15-μl enzyme solution (enzyme + 2 × reaction buffer: 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm MgCl2, 50 mm Tris, at pH 7.8) with the tritiated substrates (15 μl, approximately 20,000 dpm); in all cases, the concentrations of enzyme and substrates cited in the text are those after mixing. The TS-DHFR single enzyme turnover reaction was monitored by the addition of tritiated CH2H4folate to enzyme + NADPH and dUMP. The DHFR reaction was monitored by the addition of tritiated H2folate to enzyme + NADPH. The TS reaction was also monitored under burst conditions: 100 μm enzyme + saturating dUMP, mixed with 200 μm tritiated CH2H4folate. The enzymatic reactions were terminated by quenching with 67 μl of 0.78 n KOH to give a final concentration of 0.54 n KOH (12Liang P.-H. Anderson K.S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 12195-12205Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). TS reactions utilizing radiolabeled dUMP were quenched with 67 μl of 0.4 n HCl. The rate constants for individual single turnover rapid chemical or burst quench experiments were estimated by fitting the data to a single exponential or burst curve using the curve fitting program, Kaleidagraph. High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) Analysis—Tritiated products of the rapid quench experiments were quantified by HPLC in combination with a radioactivity flow detector. The HPLC separation was performed using a BDS-Hypersil C18 reverse phase column (250 × 4.6 mm, Keystone Scientific, Bellefonte, PA) with a flow rate of 1 ml/min. An isocratic separation using a solvent system of 10% methanol in 180 mm triethylammonium bicarbonate at pH 8.0 was employed. The elution times were as follows: H4folate, 9 min; H2folate, 18 min; CH2H4folate, 20 min. For separation of dUMP and dTMP, an isocratic separation using a solvent system of 200 mm triethylammonium bicarbonate was used. The elution times were as follows: dUMP, 11 min; dTMP 21.5 min. The HPLC effluent from the column was mixed with liquid scintillation mixture (Monoflow V, National Diagnostics) at a flow rate of 5 ml/min. Radioactivity was monitored continuously using a Flo-One radioactivity flow detector (Packard Instruments, Downers Grove, IL). The analysis system was automated using a Waters 712B WISP (Milford, MA) autosampler. Stopped-flow Absorbance/Fluorescence Measurements—Stopped-flow measurements were performed using a Kintek SF-2001 apparatus (Kintek Instruments) as described previously (12Liang P.-H. Anderson K.S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 12195-12205Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In the absorbance experiments designed to measure the burst in CH2H4folate consumption in the TS reaction, absorbance at 340 nm was monitored when 25 μm enzyme was preincubated with 1 mm dUMP and buffer (1 mm EDTA, 50 mm MgCl2, 50 mm Tris, at pH 7.8) and then mixed with 500 μm CH2H4folate. In the fluorescence experiments designed to measure the dissociation rate constants, the trapping ligand (L2) was used at a concentration of ≥5-fold excess over that of L1 to allow for analysis as a pseudo-first-order rate constant. In experiments involving enzyme and PDDF, the monochromator was set at 287 nm on the input, and the FRET was monitored with an interference filter at 380 nm. The data were collected over a given time interval using a personal computer and software provided by Kintek Instruments. Rate constants were obtained by fitting the data to a single or double exponential by nonlinear regression analysis. Spin Column Binding Assay—Bio-Spin P-30 columns (Bio-Rad) were washed with 10 mm Tris and twice with 1× reaction buffer. Columns were loaded with 30 μlof50 μm enzyme + ligands in reaction buffer and spun for 1 min at 2,000 rpm. An additional 30 μl of reaction buffer was added to the column, and the spin step was repeated. It was shown by UV absorbance that virtually all of the enzyme added to the column was recovered in the flow-through. The amount of enzyme-bound radiolabeled ligand in the flow-through was quantified by adding the 60-μl flow-through to the 7-ml Ultima Gold scintillation mixture (Packard) and counting on an LS7000 scintillation counter (Beckman). Only 1% of total FdUMP counts came through the column in the absence of enzyme; these background counts were subtracted from the total recovered in the presence of enzyme. Creation of Channel Mutants—The crystal structure of bifunctional TS-DHFR from L. major revealed a series of solvent-exposed basic residues between the two active sites, residues hypothesized to be responsible for channeling of negatively charged H2folate from TS to DHFR. We sought to test this hypothesis by mutating lysines and arginines thought to make up the channel to either glutamic acid (charge reversal) or alanine or glutamine (charge neutralization). The residues mutated were Lys-282, Arg-283, and Arg-287 in the TS domain and Lys-66, 67, 72 and 73, and Arg-64 and 74 in the DHFR domain. A total of 12 channel mutants were successfully created with up to 6 residues changed at once; 2 mutants contained changes in both the TS and DHFR domains (Table I). Consistently, mutation of Lys-73 or Arg-74 led to very low yields of active enzyme and large amounts of insoluble enzyme, suggesting that these DHFR residues may be important for protein folding/domain stability. Insufficient active enzyme for transient kinetics analysis was recovered from attempts to make the following 3 mutants: R74E, K66E/K67E/K72E/K73E/R64Q/R74Q, and R64Q/K66A/K67A/K72E/K73E.

We show that this conserved sequence in Xenopus cyclin B2, termed the RRASK motif, is required for the substrate recognition by the cyclin B-Cdc2 complex of Cdc25C. Mutations to charged residues of the RRASK motif of cyclin B2 abolished its ability to activate Cdc2 kinase without affecting its capacity to bind to Cdc2. Cdc2 bound to the cyclin B2 RRASK mutant was not dephosphorylated by Cdc25C, and as a result, the complex was inactive. The cyclin B2 RRASK mutants can form a complex with the constitutively active Cdc2, but a resulting active complex did not phosphorylate a preferred substrate Cdc25C in vitro, although it can phosphorylate the non-specific substrate histone H1. The RRASK mutations prevented the interaction of Cdc25C with the cyclin B2-Cdc2 complex. Consistently, the RRASK mutants neither induced germinal vesicle breakdown in Xenopus oocyte maturation nor activated in vivo Cdc2 kinase during the cell cycle in mitotic extracts. These results suggest that the RRASK motif in Xenopus cyclin B2 plays an important role in defining the substrate specificity of the cyclin B-Cdc2 complex.

The activities of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 1The abbreviations used are: CDK; cyclin-dependent kinase; CBF; cyclin box fold, CSF; cytostatic factor, GST; glutathione S-transferase. are essential for eukaryotic cell cycle progression. Monomeric CDKs are inactive and associate with the cyclin subunits to form active complexes. The activities of the cyclin-CDK complexes are controlled by their interactions with several proteins, such as activating and inhibitory kinases, CDK inhibitors, and adaptors. Cyclin-CDK complexes interact with specific substrates and phosphorylate them temporally. Different types of cyclins associate with distinct CDKs to form active complexes, and these cyclin-CDK complexes phosphorylate different substrates in cell cycle progression. Recognition of specific substrates by the cyclin-CDK complex is determined in part by interactions of the cyclin subunit with the substrate (1Endicott J.A. Noble M.E. Tucker J.A. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1999; 9: 738-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 2Millar M.E. Cross F.R. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1811-1820PubMed Google Scholar). How the cyclin confers CDK substrate selectivity is one of the fundamental problems in cell cycle regulation. Some CDK substrates, such as pRb, Cdc25, Cdc6, and the CDK inhibitor p21, contain an RXL motif (3Adams P.D. Sellers W.R. Sharma S.K. Wu A.D. Nalin C.M. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Mol. Cell.

Biol. 2001; 21: 4868-4874Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The RXL motif of these substrates binds directly to the MRAIL motif of the cyclin. The MRAIL motif is present in a hydrophobic patch region in the cyclin box fold 1 (CBF1). This motif in cyclin A has been shown to be a docking site for cyclin A-Cdk2 substrates (7Schulman B.A. Lindstrom D.L. Harlow E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10453-10458Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). In cyclin D, the LXCXE motif present in its N-terminal sequence binds directly to pRb, and mutations in this sequence inhibit efficient pRb phosphorylation (8Dowdy S.F. Hinds P.W. Louie K. Reed S.I. Arnold A. Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1993; 73: 499-511Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar, 9Lee J.-O. Russo A.A. Pavletich N.P. Nature. 1998; 391: 859-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). Likewise, mutations within a similar LXCXE motif in cyclin E prevent phosphorylation of pRb by the cyclin E-Cdk2 complexes (10Kelly B.L. Wolfe K.G. Roberts J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2535-2540Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). These motifs enhance the activity of the G1 cyclin-CDK complex toward specific substrates. These findings suggest that the substrate recognition is defined in part by specific motifs in the cyclin subunit. In comparison with G1 cyclin, it is rather difficult to detect the interaction of mitotic substrates with cyclin B, probably due to high substrate turnover. So far, the interactions of cyclin B-Cdc2 with the RXL motif of Myt1 (11Liu F. Rothblum-Oviatt C. Ryan C.E. Piwnica-Worms H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5113-5123Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) and of Cdc25C (12Morris M.C. Divita G. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 286: 475-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 13Morris M.C. Heitz A. Mery J. Heitz F. Divita G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28849-28857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) have been investigated. Several distinct domains and motifs that are involved in CDK regulation characterize cyclin proteins. The N-terminal CBF1 in the middle region of cyclins is required for CDK association (14Kobayashi H. Stewart E. Poon R. Adamczewski J.P. Gannon J. Hunt T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 1279-1294Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 15Lees E.M. Harlow E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1194-1201Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), and the N-terminal domain including a destruction box is necessary for the ubiquitin-dependent cyclin degradation (16Glozter M. Murray A.W. Kirschner M.W. Nature. 1991; 349: 132-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (1903) Google Scholar, 17Stewart E. Kobayashi H. Harrison D. Hunt T. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 584-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). A cytoplasmic retention signal for subcellular localization of the cyclin is located between the destruction box and the cyclin box (18Pines J. Hunter T. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3772-3781Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). The N-terminal helix motif upstream of the cyclin box contributes to specific binding of cyclins A and B to CDKs (19Goda T. Funakoshi M. Suhara H. Nishimoto T. Kobayashi H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15415-15422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The MRAIL motif that contributes to a hydrophobic patch on the surface of cyclin A serves as a substrate-docking site (7Schulman B.A. Lindstrom D.L. Harlow E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10453-10458Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). In this study, we describe that the degenerate RRASK motif of cyclin B is required for the substrate recognition of Cdc25C by the cyclin B-Cdc2 complex. The RRASK motif is found in the N-terminal region of the second cyclin box fold (CBF2) in cyclin B but is not present in cyclin A. We have generated mutations in the RRASK motif to analyze its role in mediating substrate-cyclin B interaction. Mutations within the RRASK motif in Xenopus cyclin B2 did not affect its binding to Cdc2, but abolished its ability to activate Cdc2 kinase in vivo and in vitro, as a result of a failure of Cdc25C to dephosphorylate the cyclin B2-Cdc2 complex. Furthermore, a constitutively active Cdc2 mutant (Cdc2-AF) bound to the cyclin B2 RRASK mutant failed to phosphorylate the preferred Cdc2 kinase mitotic substrates, Cdc25C and Myt1. The affinity of the cyclin B-Cdc2 for these substrates was decreased by RRASK mutations. The RRASK motif of cyclin B thus affects Cdc2 activity by mediating critical interactions between the cyclin B-Cdc2 complex and the mitotic substrates. We discuss the role of the RRASK motif of cyclin B in substrate recognition by CDK. Construction of Cyclin B2 Mutants, Cdc25C, Myt1, and Cdc2—The RRASK mutants of Xenopus laevis cyclin B2, K272Q (Lys-272 mutated to Gln), R268A/R269A (Arg-268 to Ala, Arg-269 to Ala), and R268L/R269Q/K272Q (Arg-268 to Leu, Arg-269 to Gln, Lys-272 to Gln), were made by PCR-based in vitro mutagenesis (20Horton R.M. Pease L.R. McPherson M.J. Directed Mutagenesis. IRL Press, Oxford1991: 217-247Google Scholar). R163A was constructed as described previously (19Goda T. Funakoshi M. Suhara H. Nishimoto T. Kobayashi H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15415-15422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Myc-tagged and GST-tagged cyclin B2 constructs were also made by PCR-based in vitro mutagenesis (20Horton R.M. Pease L.R. McPherson M.J. Directed Mutagenesis. IRL Press, Oxford1991: 217-247Google Scholar). In brief, the Myc tag sequence was subcloned at the N terminus of Xenopus cyclin B2 in pT7GUK+ by NcoI digestion of Xenopus cyclin B2 in pT7GUK+ and of the Myc tag sequence with an NcoI site at the end. To prepare GST-tagged cyclin B2, a GST tag sequence that has a BglII site at the N terminus and an NcoI site at the C terminus was subcloned into Xenopus cyclin B2 in pT7GUK+. Both constructs were confirmed by sequencing. Xenopus Cdc2-AF-4Myc was constructed as follows: Cdc2-AF (21Nakajo N. Yoshitome S. Iwashita J. Iida M. Uto K. Ueno S. Okamoto K. Sagata N. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 328-338PubMed Google Scholar) in pT7GUK+ and Cdc2-4Myc in pT7GUK+ were digested with NdeI and HindIII, and then Cdc2-AF fragment was subcloned into Cdc2-4Myc in pT7GUK+. Xenopus Cdc25C and Xenopus Myt1 were described elsewhere (21Nakajo N. Yoshitome S. Iwashita J. Iida M. Uto K. Ueno S. Okamoto K. Sagata N. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 328-338PubMed Google Scholar, 22Nakajo N. Oe T. Uto K Sagata N. Dev. Biol. 1999; 207: 432-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Xenopus Egg Extracts, in Vitro Translation, Immunoprecipitation— Xenopus CSF extracts and mitotic extracts were prepared by the standard method (23Murray A.W. Methods Cell Biol. 1991; 36: 581-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar). The mCAP RNA capping kit (Stratagene) was used for in vitro transcription of cyclin B2 mutants and Cdc2. 0.5 μCi of [35S]methionine and mRNAs to a final concentration of 0.1 μg/μl were added to 10 μl of RNase-treated or non-treated Xenopus egg extracts. After incubating at 23 °C for 90 min, 1-μl samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. For immunoprecipitation, reactions (10 μl) were diluted with 300 μl of bead buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm NaF, 250 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 15 μg/ml benzamidine) and incubated with anti-Cdc2, anti-cyclin B2, or anti-Myc antibody at 4 °C for 1 h with rotation. Protein A-Sepharose beads were added and then incubated at 4 °C for 1 h with rotation. The beads were recovered after washing with bead buffer three times. [35S]-labeled cyclins and/or Cdc2 were detected by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. GST Pull-down Assay and Immunoblotting—GST-tagged cyclin B2 mRNAs to a final concentration of 0.1 μg/μl were added to 10 μl of Xenopus CSF extracts. After incubating at 23 °C for 90 min, 1-μl samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting with anti-GST antibody. For GST pull-down assays, reactions (10 μl) were diluted with 300 μl of bead buffer, mixed with GSH-agarose beads, and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h with rotation. The beads were washed with bead buffer three times, and then co-precipitated Cdc2 was detected by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with anti-Cdc2 or anti-phospho-Cdc2 antibody. Preparation of GST-Cdc25C and GST-Myt1 Protein—Xenopus Cdc25C in pGEX-KG and a C-terminal fragment of Xenopus Myt1 (residues 392–548) in pGEX-KG were transformed into Escherichia coli BL21 cells. Protein expression was induced by addition of 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 8 h at 26 °C. The bacteria were lysed in ELB+ (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 250 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin) and sonicated. After centrifugation, the supernatant was incubated with GSH-agarose beads, and bound proteins were eluted with 10 mm glutathione (pH 7.0). Phosphorylation of Histone H1, GST-Cdc25C, and GST-Myt1—For in vitro phosphorylation assays, mRNAs coding for Myc-tagged Xenopus cyclin B2 and its mutants were translated in the mitotic extracts supplemented with [35S]methionine at 23 °C for 2 h and then immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc antibody and protein A-Sepharose beads. In the case of cyclin-Cdc2-AF complex, mRNAs of Xenopus cyclin B2 mutants were co-translated with Cdc2-AF-4Myc mRNA in RNase-treated mitotic extracts supplemented with [35S]methionine at 23 °C for 2 h. Cyclin-Cdc2-AF complex was immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc antibody and protein A-Sepharose beads. Beads were then washed with bead buffer three times and incubated with the reaction mixture (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 15 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EGTA, 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm ATP, 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, 0.1 μg/μl histone H1) at 23 °C for 30 min. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. For phosphorylation of Xenopus Cdc25C or Myt1, GST-Cdc25C or GST-Myt1 (residues 392–548) replaced histone H1 and were assayed as described above. To assay in vivo Cdc2 kinase activity in mitotic extracts, mRNAs of Xenopus wild-type or mutant cyclin B2 were translated in RNase-treated mitotic extract with [35S]methionine at 23 °C. 1 μl of the extracts was incubated with 9 μl of reaction mixture (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 15 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EGTA, 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm ATP, 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, 0.1 μg/μl histone H1) at 23 °C for 30 min. The samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Interaction of GST-Cdc25C and GST-Myt1 with the Cyclin B-Cdc2 Complex—Xenopus cyclin B2 and mutant mRNAs were translated in vitro with [35S]methionine added to the RNase-treated CSF/reticulocyte lysate mixture (1:1). 10 μl of this reaction mixture was incubated with 4 μg of GST-Cdc25C, GST-Myt1 (residues 392–548), or GST for 10 min at 23 °C and then diluted with 300 μl of bead buffer containing with 0.1 or 2% Tween 20 instead of 0.1% Nonidet P-40. GSH-agarose beads were then added, incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with rotation, and finally washed three times with bead buffer containing with 0.1 or 2% Tween 20 instead of 0.1% Nonidet P-40. Bound proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE. The gel was dried and exposed to x-ray film. Microinjection—Xenopus stage VI oocytes were injected with 2.7 ng of cyclin B2 or the mRNAs of its mutant and cultured at 20 °C in modified Barth's solution (24Sagata N. Oskarsson M. Copeland T. Brumbaugh J. Vande Woude G.F. Nature. 1988; 335: 519-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). Maturation was assessed by appearance of a white spot in the animal pole of injected oocytes. Antibodies—Anti-Cdc25C antibody was prepared as described (22Nakajo N. Oe T. Uto K Sagata N. Dev. Biol. 1999; 207: 432-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Anti-Cdc2 monoclonal (A17) and anti-cyclin B2 monoclonal (X121) antibodies were provided by Tim Hunt (Cancer Research UK, London, UK). Anti-c-Myc antibody (A14) was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, and anti-phospho-Cdc2 antibody (Tyr-15) was purchased from Cell Signaling Technology, Inc. Mutations in the RRASK Motif of Cyclin B2 Abolish Its Ability to Activate Cdc2 Kinase without Affecting Binding to Cdc2—Cyclin B contains the amino acid sequence FLRRXSK in the first α-helix of cyclin box fold 2, which we refer to as the RRASK motif. This degenerate RRASK motif is well conserved in B-type cyclins but not in cyclin A (Fig. 1A). To explore its role in the cyclin-CDK complex, we made a number of mutants at the charged amino acids of the RRASK motif in Xenopus cyclin B2, in which basic residues RRXXK were substituted to either non-charged or structurally similar residues or to alanine. A single mutant K272Q, a double mutant R268A/R269A (designated as RR268AA), and a triple mutant R268L/R269Q/K272Q (designated as RRK268LQQ) were prepared. First, we examined the effect of mutations in the RRASK motif on the ability of cyclin B2 to bind to Cdc2 and to activate the Cdc2 kinase in Xenopus egg extracts. Cyclin mRNAs were translated in nuclease-treated CSF extracts supplemented with [35S]methionine, and the cyclin B2-Cdc2 complexes were immunoprecipitated with anti-Cdc2 antibody. Fig. 1B shows that RRASK mutants bound to Cdc2 (RR268AA, RRK268LQQ, K272Q; lanes 2–4, middle panel). Next, Myc-tagged versions of cyclin B2 and its mutants were translated and pulled down from the extracts by immunoprecipitation with anti-Myc antibody. The Myc-cyclin B-Cdc2 complex was then assayed for histone H1 kinase activity (lower panel). The RRASK mutant-Cdc2 complexes failed to phosphorylate histone H1 (RR268AA (lane 2) and RRK268LQQ (lane 3)). As a control, the MRAIL motif mutant R163A neither bound to Cdc2 nor activated Cdc2 kinase (lane 5). Histone H1 was phosphorylated by the cyclin B2 single mutant K272Q-Cdc2 (lane 4), as well as by the wild-type cyclin B2-Cdc2 (lane 1) complexes. The result shows that the RRASK mutants of cyclin B2 abolish its ability to activate Cdc2 kinase, without affecting binding to Cdc2 in egg extracts. Cdc2 Bound to the Cyclin B2 RRASK Mutants Is Not Dephosphorylated by Cdc25C—We next tested the phosphorylation state of Cdc2 bound to the RRASK mutants (Fig. 2). Nucleasetreated mitotic extracts containing [35S]-labeled Cdc2 (Fig. 2A, lane 1) were incubated with cyclin B2 or RR268AA mRNAs to drive the cell cycle, and the cyclin-Cdc2 complex was analyzed by immunoprecipitation with anti-cyclin B2 antibody followed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. In control experiments, Cdc2 bound to wild-type cyclin B2 was phosphorylated and then dephosphorylated during the cell cycle (lanes 2–5), whereas Cdc2 bound to RR268AA was phosphorylated but not subsequently dephosphorylated (lanes 6–9). This result indicates that Cdc2 bound to RR268AA failed to be dephosphorylated by Cdc25C. To determine whether Cdc2 bound to the RRASK mutant is phosphorylated or not, Cdc2 was immunoblotted with anti-phospho-Cdc2 antibody (Fig. 2B). GST-tagged cyclins were used in this experiment. Following incubation in the extracts for 90 min (Fig. 2A), GST-bound Cdc2 was immunoblotted with anti-phospho-Cdc2 antibody. Cdc2 bound to wild-type cyclin B2 (lane 2) and to K272Q (lane 4) were dephosphorylated, but Cdc2 bound to RRK268LQQ was not dephosphorylated at Tyr-15 (lane 3). Thus, Cdc2 bound to the cyclin B2 RRASK mutant, which is once phosphorylated by Myt1/Wee1 inhibitory kinase, fails to be dephosphorylated at Tyr-15 by Cdc25C. This result was confirmed by chase experiments in which the phosphorylated form of Cdc2 (samples in Fig. 2A, lanes 2 or 6) was incubated with an active Cdc25C, and dephosphorylation of Cdc2 was followed at entry into mitosis by adding active Cdc25C to the extracts (Fig. 2C). Cdc2 bound to wild-type cyclin B2 was dephosphorylated by active Cdc25C (lanes 1–4), whereas Cdc2 bound to RR268AA was not (lanes 5–8). The Constitutively Active Cdc2-AF Complexed with the Cyclin B2 RRASK Mutant Phosphorylates a General Substrate Histone H1 but Not Mitotic Substrates Cdc25C and Myt1—We next investigated the ability of phosphorylation by the constitutively active Cdc2 bound to the cyclin B2 RRASK mutant in vitro (Fig. 3). To do this, two Cdc25C-dependent dephosphorylation sites of Cdc2 (Thr-14 and Tyr-15) were substituted to Ala and Phe (Cdc2-AF), respectively. Cdc2-AF is constitutively active and therefore does not require dephosphorylation by Cdc25C to phosphorylate its substrates (21Nakajo N. Yoshitome S. Iwashita J. Iida M. Uto K. Ueno S. Okamoto K. Sagata N. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 328-338PubMed Google Scholar). Both Myc-tagged Cdc2-AF and the cyclin B2 RRASK mutant were translated in nuclease-treated mitotic extracts, and the cyclin B2-Cdc2-AF complex was immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc antibody (Fig. 3A). Cdc2-AF bound to RR268AA (lane 2) and to RRK268LQQ (lane 3). The active complex was then assayed for in vitro phosphorylation against a general substrate histone H1 and a preferred substrate Cdc25C (Fig. 3, B and C). Active Cdc2-AF bound to RR268AA or to RRK268LQQ phosphorylated a general substrate histone H1 (Fig. 3B, upper panel, lanes 2 and 3). However, even the active complex failed to phosphorylate Cdc25C, the preferred cyclin B2-Cdc2 substrate (middle panel, lanes 2 and 3). In comparison, Cdc2-AF complexed with the MRAIL mutant (R163A) phosphorylated neither histone H1 nor Cdc25C (lane 4). As a control, the K272Q-Cdc2-AF complex, as well as the wild-type cyclin B2-Cdc2-AF complex, can phosphorylate both Cdc25C and histone H1 (Fig. 3C). These results show that the RRASK motif of cyclin B2 is required for phosphorylation of the preferred mitotic substrate Cdc25C, indicating the failure of Cdc25C binding to the cyclin B-Cdc2 complex. We also examined phosphorylation of another mitotic substrate, Myt1. Because Myt1 kinase inhibits the cyclin B-Cdc2 complex (25Coleman T.R. Dunphy W.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 877-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar), we removed the kinase domain from the central portion of Myt1 and used its C-terminal segment as substrate (residues 392–548). Similarly, the Cdc2-AF complexed with RRASK mutants altered the phosphorylation state of the C-terminal Myt1 (Fig. 3B, lower panel, lanes 2 and 3), suggesting that some specific site(s) of the multiphosphorylation sites within the C-terminal Myt1 failed to be phosphorylated (see “Discussion”). Physical Interaction of Mitotic Substrates Cdc25C and Myt1 with the Cyclin B2-Cdc2 Complex Is Prevented by the Mutations within the RRASK Motif—Then, we investigated the effects of the RRASK mutation on physical interaction of Cdc25C with the RR268AA-Cdc2 complex (Fig. 4). GST-Cdc25C was incubated with the CSF/reticulocyte mixed extracts containing [35S]-labeled cyclin B2 or RR268AA. After incubating the extracts for 10 min, the GSH-agarose beads were added to precipitate GST-bound materials followed by washing in the presence of Tween 20 (see “Experimental Procedures”). By using these conditions, we can detect a transient interaction between Cdc25C and the cyclin B2-Cdc2 complex in Xenopus (Fig. 4, lanes 3–10). GST-Cdc25C associated with wild-type cyclin B2-Cdc2 complex (Fig. 4A, lanes 3 and 7) but not with GST alone (lanes 5 and 9). In contrast to wild-type cyclin B2, the association between the RR268AA-Cdc2 and GST-Cdc25C was decreased to about 25% that bound to the wild-type cyclin B2-Cdc2 complex (lanes 4 and 8). Similarly, the association of the Myt1 C-terminal segment with RR268AA was decreased 50% (Fig. 4B, lanes 4 and 8). Thus, the mutant RR268AA impaired the interaction of Cdc25C and Myt1 with the cyclin B2-Cdc2 complex, indicating that the RRASK motif of cyclin B2 affects specific interactions of mitotic substrates with the cyclin BCdc2 complex. Interestingly, both substrates bound less well to the phosphorylated form of RR268AA than to the non-phosphorylated form (cf. Fig. 4, upper and lower bands, lanes 4 and 8; see also “Discussion”). The RRASK Mutants Neither Induce Germinal Vesicle Breakdown in Oocyte Maturation nor Activate in Vivo Cdc2 Kinase in Xenopus Egg Extracts—To confirm the effects of the RRASK mutations on cells in vivo, we first injected mRNAs encoding mutant cyclins into Xenopus stage VI oocytes and examined the occurrence of germinal vesicle breakdown in meiotic maturation. As evident in Fig. 5A, oocytes injected with RR268AA mRNA did not undergo germinal vesicle breakdown, whereas those injected with the K272Q did. Next, we investigated the ability of RRASK mutants to activate Cdc2 kinase in mitotic extracts in vivo (Fig. 5B). mRNAs of cyclin B2 or RR268AA were translated in the nuclease-treated mitotic extracts to drive the cell cycle, and in vivo Cdc2 kinase was followed by histone H1 phosphorylation during cell cycle progression. Consistent with the result of microinjection, addition of RR268AA mRNA did not activate Cdc2 kinase during mitosis (lanes 6–10). As a control, cyclin B2 mRNA can activate Cdc2 kinase (lanes 1–5), in accordance with its pattern of phosphorylation. Both sets of in vivo data in Fig. 5 clearly show that mutations in the RRASK motif abolished the ability to entry into M-phase in Xenopus egg system. Roles of the RRASK Motif and the MRAIL Motif in the Substrate Recognition of the Cyclin B-Cdc2 Complex—Cyclin plays a primary role in the substrate recognition by the cyclin-CDK complex (2Millar M.E. Cross F.R. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1811-1820PubMed Google Scholar). For example, the substrate Cdc25C binds in vitro to cyclin monomer with high affinity and with less affinity to the CDK-cyclin complexes (12Morris M.C. Divita G. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 286: 475-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Cdc25C possesses a cyclininteracting motif (residues 195–244 in human Cdc25C) (13Morris M.C. Heitz A. Mery J. Heitz F. Divita G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28849-28857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In this study, we show that the RRASK motif in CBF2 is required for the recognition of Cdc25C by cyclin B2-Cdc2. Two basic residues Arg-268 and Arg-269 of the RRASK motif are essential for interaction with the substrate Cdc25C but not for the interaction of cyclin B2 with Cdc2. A prediction from the crystal structure of the cyclin A/CDK2 (26Brown N.R. Noble M.E. Endicott J.A. Garman E.F. Wakatsuki S. Mitchell E. Rasmussen B. Hunt T. Johnson L.N. Structure. 1995; 3: 1235-1247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 27Jeffrey P.D. Russo A.A. Polyak K. Gibbs E. Hurwitz J. Massague J. Pavletich N.P. Nature. 1995; 376: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (1216) Google Scholar) is that the RRASK motif would be exposed on the cyclin B surface near the catalytic cleft between the Cdc2 N-terminal and C-terminal lobes. The specificity of substrate recognition is increased by preassociation of the substrate with a kinase at a docking site adjacent to its catalytic domain (28Holland P.M. Cooper J.A. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: R329-R331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 29Tanoue T. Adachi M. Moriguchi T. Nishida E. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 110-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar). It is thus conceivable that the RRASK motif in the first α-helix of CBF2 may aid in a docking interaction with Cdc25C. The RRASK mutant-Cdc2 complex is also impaired in its ability to bind and phosphorylate Myt1 (Figs. 3 and 4), a Cdc2 regulator that also contains a cyclininteracting RXL motif in its C-terminal sequence (11Liu F. Rothblum-Oviatt C. Ryan C.E. Piwnica-Worms H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5113-5123Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of a kinase-dead Wee1 by the RRASK mutant-Cdc2-AF complex was also decreased (data not shown). Thus, the RRASK motif may participate in the recognition of a subset of mitotic substrates that includes at least Cdc25C, Myt1, and Wee1. The RRASK motif is well conserved not only in cyclin B2 but also in cyclins B1, B4, and B5 (30Hochegger H. Klotzbucher A. Kirk J. Howell M. Guellec K.I. Fletcher K. Duncan T. Sohail M. Hunt T. Development. 2001; 128: 3795-3807Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but less in cyclin B3. Besides the RRASK motif in CBF2 of cyclin B, the MRAIL motif is present at the N-terminal region in CBF1 of cyclins A, B, D, and E (Fig. 1). The MRAIL motif is located at the opposite surface of the cyclin from the catalytic site of the cyclin-CDK complex (1Endicott J.A. Noble M.E. Tucker J.A. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1999; 9: 738-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 27Jeffrey P.D. Russo A.A. Polyak K. Gibbs E. Hurwitz J. Massague J. Pavletich N.P. Nature. 1995; 376: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (1216) Google Scholar). In the cyclin A-Cdk2 complex, a hydrophobic patch containing the MRAIL motif (residues Met-210, Leu-214, and Trp-217 in human cyclin A) is important for binding of the substrate p107 to cyclin A (7Schulman B.A. Lindstrom D.L. Harlow E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10453-10458Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Moreover, other CDK-interacting proteins such as kinase inhibitors and the adapter Cdc6 utilize this motif to bind directly on cyclins A and E (5Adams P.D. Li X. Sellers W.R. Baker K.B. Leng X. Harper J.W. Taya Y. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1068-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 6Wohlschlegel J.A. Dwyer B.T. Takeda D.Y. Dutta A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4868-4874Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 31Calzada A. Sacristan M. Sanchez E. Bueno A. Nature. 2001; 412: 355-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 32Furstenthal L. Kaiser B.K. Swanson C. Jackson P.K. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 1267-1278Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The MRAIL motif in the cyclin B-Cdc2 complex has a similar role in substrate binding. In the cyclin B structure, the hydrophobic patch that includes the MRAIL sequence was first identified as the P box, which is required for Cdc25 activation. P box mutants (residues Arg-202, Asp-231 in human cyclin B) could bind to Cdc2 but could not activate Cdc2 kinase, as a result of the inactivation of Cdc25 (33Zheng X.-F. Ruderman J.V. Cell. 1993; 75: 155-164Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In comparison, the RRASK mutant can bind to Cdc2 but cannot activate Cdc2 kinase, as a result of the failure of binding to Cdc25C. Thus, in this context, the RRASK motif must play a more direct role in the interaction of Cdc25C with the cyclin B2-Cdc2 that is distinct from its previously characterized role as a part of the P box. Recently, the P box region of human cyclin B1 has been also shown to interact with Cdc25C (13Morris M.C. Heitz A. Mery J. Heitz F. Divita G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28849-28857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Taken together with these data, it appears that the substrate recognition of Cdc25C by the cyclin B-Cdc2 complex requires not only the RRASK motif but also the MRAIL motif. Relationship between Mitotic Substrate and High Cdc2 Kinase Activity in M-phase—Associations between the cyclin BCdc2 and its mitotic substrates are rather unstable as compared with those between the cyclin A/E-Cdk2 and their substrates. In this regard, it is intriguing that CDK activity in S-phase is at a low level and that a further increase to a high level would initiate mitosis (34Nurse P. Biol. Chem. 1999; 380: 729-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). This result suggests that phosphorylation of mitotic substrates requires high kinase activity, perhaps achieved in part by cyclin B-Cdc2 having a high turnover as a result of shortening the time of a contact between the substrate and the cyclin-CDK complex. Two cooperative substrate-interacting motifs, the MRAIL in CBF1 and the RRASK in CBF2, might contribute to high levels of Cdc2 kinase activity through a transient but efficient interaction with the substrate. Based on previous observations and our findings in this report, we propose that the RRASK motif of cyclin B plays a critical role in increasing the affinity of mitotic substrates captured by the MRAIL motif and thereby enhances cyclin B-Cdc2 substrate specificity. Rapid Cdc2 kinase activation at the entry into mitosis involves increased Cdc25 phosphatase activity and a coordinate reduction in the activity of Myt1 kinase (35Kishimoto T. Okumura E. Prog. Cell Cycle Res. 1997; 3: 241-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Cdc2 kinase phosphorylates Cdc25C, and the resulting phosphorylated Cdc25C activates Cdc2 kinase (25Coleman T.R. Dunphy W.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 877-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). In contrast to the positive feedback loop on Cdc2 activity by Cdc25C phosphorylation, Myt1 kinase is hyperphosphorylated by Cdc2 kinase concomitant with a decrease in its kinase activity and creates a negative feedback on Cdc2 activity by Myt1 phosphorylation (36Fattaey A. Booher R.N. Prog. Cell Cycle Res. 1997; 3: 233-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Although Myt1 could also interact with the cyclin B-Cdc2 complex through the RRASK motif, its interaction with the RRASK motif appears to be distinct from that of Cdc25C. Judging from Figs. 3 and 4, Cdc2 bound to the RRASK mutant can still phosphorylate Myt1 in vitro with an alteration of its pattern, although the association with Myt1 substrate is impaired (about 50%). This suggests that some of phosphorylation sites within the Myt1 C-terminal sequence could be selectively phosphorylated by an efficient interaction between Myt1 and the cyclin B-Cdc2 via the RRASK motif. In addition, we have noticed that a phosphorylated form of the cyclin B2 RRASK mutants associates less well with the substrates Cdc25C and Myt1 (Fig. 4). This result may reflect a dependence of cyclin B-substrate interaction on cyclin B phosphorylation. Presumably, the cyclin B2-Cdc2 complex “intra”-phosphorylates its cyclin B subunit, and then the autophosphorylated cyclin B could attach preferably to the mitotic substrate.
