https://openalex.org/W2163183874,"The knowledge of human genetic variation that will come from the human genome sequence makes feasible a polygenic approach to disease prevention, in which it will be possible to identify individuals as susceptible by their genotype profile and to prevent disease by targeting interventions to those at risk. There is doubt, however, regarding the magnitude of these genetic effects and thus the potential to apply them to either individuals or populations. We have therefore examined the potential for prediction of risk based on common genetic variation using data from a population-based series of individuals with breast cancer. The data are compatible with a log-normal distribution of genetic risk in the population that is sufficiently wide to provide useful discrimination of high- and low-risk groups. Assuming all of the susceptibility genes could be identified, the half of the population at highest risk would account for 88% of all affected individuals. By contrast, if currently identified risk factors for breast cancer were used to stratify the population, the half of the population at highest risk would account for only 62% of all cases. These results suggest that the construction and use of genetic-risk profiles may provide significant improvements in the efficacy of population-based programs of intervention for cancers and other diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2101744962,"Corticosteroids have been shown to exert beneficial effects in the treatment of acute myocardial infarction, but the precise mechanisms underlying their protective effects are unknown. Here we show that high-dose corticosteroids exert cardiovascular protection through a novel mechanism involving the rapid, non-transcriptional activation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS). Binding of corticosteroids to the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) stimulated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and protein kinase Akt, leading to eNOS activation and nitric oxide dependent vasorelaxation. Acute administration of pharmacological concentrations of corticosteroids in mice led to decreased vascular inflammation and reduced myocardial infarct size following ischemia and reperfusion injury. These beneficial effects of corticosteroids were abolished by GR antagonists or eNOS inhibitors in wild-type mice and were completely absent in eNOS-deficient (Nos3(-/-)) mice. The rapid activation of eNOS by the non-nuclear actions of GR, therefore, represents an important cardiovascular protective effect of acute high-dose corticosteroid therapy."

A widely conserved family of high affinity copper transport proteins (Ctr proteins) mediates copper uptake at the plasma membrane. However, little is known about Ctr protein topology, structure, and the mechanisms by which this class of transporters mediates high affinity copper uptake. In this report, we elucidate the topological orientation of the yeast Ctr1 copper transport protein. We show that a series of clustered methionine residues in the hydrophilic extracellular domain and an MXXXM motif in the second transmembrane domain are important for copper uptake but not for protein sorting and delivery to the cell surface. The conversion of these methionine residues to cysteine, by site-directed mutagenesis, strongly suggests that they coordinate to copper during the process of metal transport. Genetic evidence supports an essential role for cooperativity between monomers for the formation of an active Ctr transport complex. Together, these results support a fundamentally conserved mechanism for high affinity copper uptake through the Ctr proteins in yeast and humans.

With the exception of yeast Ctr3, all Ctr family members are rich in methionine residues within the amino-terminal hydrophilic portion of the protein (18Labbé S. Peña M.M. Fernandes A.R.

It has been suggested that these residues, arranged as MXXM or MXM (Mets motifs), could be involved in extracellular copper binding (10Dancis A. Yuan D.S. Haile D. Askwith C. Eide D. Moehle C. Kaplan J. Klausner R.D. Cell. 1994; 76: 393-402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar), but experimental evidence supporting a role for these methionine-rich sequences in copper transport is currently lacking. According to computer algorithm analyses, Ctr family members contain three membrane-spanning domains, within which most of protein sequence similarity lies. Biochemical and microscopy experiments in yeast and human cells have suggested that Ctr family members are integral membrane proteins that assemble as multimers and localize to the plasma membrane (17Peña M.M. Puig S. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33244-33251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 23Dancis A. Haile D. Yuan D.S. Klausner R.D. J. Biol.

Prohaska J.R. Thiele D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6842-6847Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar, 26Kuo Y.M. Zhou B. Cosco D. Gitschier J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In the current study we elucidate the topological orientation of theS. cerevisiae Ctr1. We also identify conserved methionine residues in both yeast and mammalian Ctr1 which are essential for copper import. Interestingly, specific amino acid substitutions strongly suggest that these methionine residues may coordinate copper during the process of copper transport. The results of these studies support a similar mechanism for copper transport for members of the Ctr family of copper transporters from yeast to humans. Yeast strain MPY17 (27Peña M.M.O. Koch K.A. Thiele D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2514-2523Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), lacking both the Ctr1 and Ctr3 high affinity copper transporters, was used for functional complementation and yeast 64Cu uptake experiments. Yeast strain 66 (23), a kind gift from Andrew Dancis (University of Pennsylvania), was used for yeast Ctr1 topological studies. Yeast strains were transformed with centromeric plasmids and maintained in minimal selective medium (SC) with adequate requirements. Media were solidified with 1.5% agar. HEK293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) with 10% fetal bovine serum under 5% CO2. Cells were transfected with the pcDNA3.1(+) empty vector or the same vector carrying the wild type or mutant hCtr1 alleles under control of the cytomegalovirus promoter. Transfections were performed using FuGENE 6 (Roche) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 24 h after transfection, cells were collected and divided evenly for copper uptake assays and Western blotting analysis. Wild type yeast CTR1 andCTR3 open reading frames and yeast CTRgene mutant alleles containing either amino-terminal deletions (CTR1ΔM genes) or site-specific mutations (CTR1M or CTR3M genes) were amplified by PCR withPfu Turbo DNA polymerase (Stratagene). SmaI andBamHI sites were used to clone the PCR product in the corresponding vector, p416GPD (see Fig. 2) or p416TEF (see Figs. Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5). For coexpression of wild type and mutant CTR1 orCTR3 (see Fig. 6), genes were subcloned into the p413TEF plasmid by using BamHI-XhoI restriction sites. The hCtr1 cDNA subcloned into the pcDNA 3.1(+) (Invitrogen) or p413GPD expression vectors was described previously (21Lee J. Prohaska J.R. Dagenais S.L. Glover T.W. Thiele D.J.

Chem. 2002; 277: 4380-4387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). For amino-terminal epitope tagging of hCtr1, the upstream primer containing sequences encoding the c-Myc epitope after the translation initiation codon was used for PCR amplification of the hCtr1 open reading frame. PCR products were inserted into the EcoRI andXhoI sites in the pcDNA3.1(+) and p413GPD vectors for the expression of hCtr1 in HEK293 cells and in S. cerevisiae, respectively. Site-directed mutagenesis of theS. cerevisiae CTR1 and CTR3 and human Ctr1 genes was performed by the overlap extension method (28Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R.

Koch K.A. Thiele D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2514-2523Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). MPY17 cells transformed with plasmids expressing wild type or mutant alleles of yeast CTR1, CTR3, or human Ctr1 were grown to exponential phase (A 600 nm = 0.8–1.2) in selective media. Cells were plated as drops (A 600 nm = 0.1, and serial dilutions in 10-fold increments) on selective media, ethanol/glycerol (YPEG: 1% yeast extract, 2% Bactopeptone, 2% ethanol, 3% glycerol), without or with 100 μm CuSO4 (YPEG + Cu) or with 20–200 μm bathocuproine disulfonic acid (BCS) (YPEG + BCS). Plates were incubated for 3–6 days at 30 °C and photographed. The function of the epitope-tagged Ctr alleles was compared with the wild type allele by complementation studies in the S. cerevisiaestrain MPY17 and by 64Cu uptake assays in transformed yeast cells or transfected HEK293 cells. For copper uptake measurements in yeast MPY17, cells expressing yeast CTR1 orCTR3 genes under the control of the constitutive TEF promoter (p416TEF and/or p413TEF vectors) were grown in selective media (SC-ura, or SC-ura-His) to exponential phase (A 600 nm = 0.5–1.5). Radioactive64Cu (specific activity of 15–30 mCi/μg of CuCl2, Mallinckrodt Institute of Radiology at Washington University, Saint Louis) was added to 1 ml of cell culture to a final concentration of 5 μm CuCl2, and cells were incubated at room temperature or on ice for 10 min. Time course experiments showed that the rate of copper uptake was linear for at least 20 min. Samples were quenched by adding ice-cold EDTA (10 mm final concentration), filtered, and washed twice with quenching buffer (10 mm EDTA in 0.1 mTris-succinate, pH 6.0). Cell-associated 64Cu was quantified in a γ-counter (Packard Cobra II) and calibrated to a standard curve. Values obtained on ice were subtracted from room temperature values and normalized to cell number. Experiments were repeated independently at least twice in triplicate and the S.D. represented. 64Cu uptake assays in HEK293 cells expressing hCtr1 were performed as described previously (24Lee J. Peña M.M. Nose Y. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4380-4387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). Total protein was extracted from HEK293 cells 2 days after transfection with the c-Myc epitope-tagged hCtr1 expression plasmid. Cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in lysis buffer (phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, containing 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche)). Cells in lysis buffer were incubated at 4 °C for 20 min, and the supernatant was taken after centrifugation at 4 °C for 20 min at 16,000 × g. 50 μg of protein was heated in SDS sample buffer at 37 °C for 10 min and fractionated by 15% SDS-PAGE. Monoclonal anti-c-Myc antibody (Roche) was used to detect hCtr1-Myc protein by immunoblotting. The treatment of intact yeast cells with Pronase protease (Calbiochem-Novabiochem) and subsequent protein extraction were performed as described previously (29Davis N.G. Horecka J.L. Sprague G.F., Jr. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 53-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Samples were separated in 10% SDS-PAGE, and Ctr1 protein was visualized by immunoblotting with anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma). As a control for cell integrity during exposure to Pronase, protein extracts were monitored for Pronase accessibility to phosphoglycerate kinase protein by immunoblotting with anti-phosphoglycerate kinase antibody (Molecular Probes). Indirect immunofluorescence to localize c-Myc epitope-tagged hCtr1 was performed as described previously (24Lee J. Peña M.M. Nose Y. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4380-4387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). For subcellular localization in yeast, Ctr1 and Ctr3 proteins were tagged with GFP at the carboxyl terminus as described previously (17Peña M.M. Puig S. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33244-33251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). MPY17 cells expressing the GFP fusion proteins were grown in selective media to exponential cell phase. Fluorescence signals were visualized using a Nikon Eclipse E800 fluorescence microscope equipped with a Hamamatsu ORCA-2 cooled CCD camera. Images were processed using Adobe Photoshop 5.5 software. An alignment of copper transport proteins including S. cerevisiae Ctr1 and Ctr3, S. pombe Ctr4 and Ctr5, human Ctr1 (hCtr1), mouse Ctr1 (mCtr1), and Arabidopsis thalianaCOPT1 (AtCopt1) shows several conserved structural features summarized in Fig. 1. Most of the primary structural similarity among Ctr family members lies in two regions: the conserved transmembrane domains 2 and 3 (Fig. 1, TMD2 and TMD3), with 20–40% identity) and a more variable region including transmembrane domain 1 (Fig. 1, TMD1) and the 20 preceding residues (Fig. 1, region from the Ctr1 Met-127 residue to the beginning of TMD1), with 15–50% identity. With the exception of Ctr3, the amino-terminal region of Ctr proteins is rich in motifs containing 3–5 methionine residues arranged as MXXM and MXM, where M represents methionine, and X is any amino acid (Fig. 1, Mets motifs shown ingray). Interestingly, 3 methionine residues are conserved in all known Ctrs: yeast Ctr1 Met-127 residue (Fig. 1, M127 inblack characters), which is the last methionine in the Ctr1 Mets motifs and is located 20 amino acids upstream from the putative start of TMD1; and an MXXXM motif (were Xrepresents a hydrophobic residue) located in TMD2 (Fig. 1, MXXXM). Based on computer algorithm analysis and electron microscopic localization of a carboxyl-terminal tagged version of yeast Ctr1 (10Dancis A. Yuan D.S. Haile D. Askwith C. Eide D. Moehle C. Kaplan J. Klausner R.D. Cell. 1994; 76: 393-402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar), the topological structure proposed for the Ctr family of copper transporters would locate the amino-terminal domain rich in methionine residues outside of the cell and the carboxyl-terminal region in the cytosol (4Puig S. Thiele D.J. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2002; 6: 171-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar). To test this prediction experimentally we carried out protein shaving experiments with Pronase, a protease that enters the yeast periplasmic space but does not traverse the plasma membrane. Yeast Ctr1 protein was tagged at its carboxyl terminus with two copies of the FLAG epitope. Ctr1-FLAG2 protein was able to complement the respiratory deficiency of a ctr1Δctr3Δ yeast strain completely (data not shown). Cells expressing Ctr1-FLAG2 were grown to exponential phase, whole cells were treated with Pronase, proteins extracted, and Ctr1 detected by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with anti-FLAG antibody. In the absence of Pronase treatment, Ctr1 protein migrates with a molecular mass of ∼100 kDa (Fig. 2, lane 1). After treatment with Pronase, the Ctr1 band shifted to an apparent molecular mass of ∼35 kDa (Fig. 2, lane 2), indicating that a portion of the protein was accessible to proteolysis and demonstrating that the FLAG epitope-tagged Ctr1 carboxyl terminus is located in the cytosol and protected from degradation with an extracellular protease. The levels of phosphoglycerate kinase, an intracellular enzyme, were comparable in the absence or presence of Pronase, indicating the integrity of the cells used in these experiments. Although many distinct yeast Ctr1 alleles with different carboxyl-terminal epitope tags were functional as assessed by complementation studies, none of the amino-terminal tags assayed was able to complement a ctr1Δctr3Δ mutant or was properly localized to the plasma membrane (data not shown). Thus, we used a different strategy to ascertain the localization of the yeast Ctr1 amino terminus with respect to the plasma membrane. Yeast Ctr1 protein migrates with an apparent molecular mass of ∼100 kDa, considerably larger than the predicted size of 46 kDa. Biochemical and genetic studies suggested that this aberrant migration is a consequence ofO-glycosylation (23Dancis A. Haile D. Yuan D.S. Klausner R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25660-25667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A possible Ctr1 target forO-linked sugar modification is the amino-terminal portion of the protein which is rich in serine residues. A series of amino-terminal deletions of Ctr1 was constructed by removing 25 (ΔM1–2), 66 (ΔM1–4), 101 (ΔM1–6), or 126 residues (ΔM1–8), and proteins were epitope tagged at the carboxyl terminus with two copies of the FLAG sequence. As described previously for Ctr1-FLAG2, cells were treated (+) or not (−) with Pronase, and Ctr1 was detected by immunoblotting with anti-FLAG antibody. Deletion of amino-terminal residues decreased the size of the protein (Fig. 2, lanes 3,5, 7, and 9); however, the reduction in protein size was greater than expected, based on the number of amino acid residues removed. The Ctr1ΔM1–8 protein decreased ∼65 kDa in apparent size (from 100 kDa for wild type to 35 kDa; Fig. 2,lanes 1 and 9), instead of 13 kDa as expected for the 126-amino acid deletion. This suggests that the yeast Ctr1 amino terminus is glycosylated and, accordingly, localized outside of the cell. Additionally, the molecular mass for Ctr1ΔM1–8 (35 kDa) is similar to the protease-protected band obtained for both wild type Ctr1 and amino-terminal deletions (Fig. 2, lanes 2, 4,6, 8, 9, and 10), indicating that the amino-terminal region removed in Ctr1 deletions is an extracellular domain accessible to proteolysis. From these results we can conclude that the amino terminus of yeast Ctr1 is located outside of the cell. Furthermore, the fluorescence signal of an amino-terminally c-Myc epitope-tagged human Ctr1 protein, expressed in HEK293 cells, was observed at the periphery of both permeabilized and nonpermeabilized cells, suggesting that the amino-terminal region in human Ctr1 protein is also exposed to the extracellular face of the plasma membrane in transfected HEK293 cells (data not shown). Yeast Ctr1 and other members of the Ctr family of copper transporters are rich in methionine residues, arranged as MXXM and MXM motifs containing 3–5 methionine residues (Mets motifs) within the amino-terminal domain (Fig. 1). Based on homology with motifs present in bacterial copper homeostasis proteins such as Enterococcus hirae CopB (30Odermatt A. Suter H. Krapf R. Solioz M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12775-12779Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), Pseudomonas syringae CopA (31Cha J.S. Cooksey D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

We have created mice deficient in the mouse ortholog (solute carrier family 23 member 1 or Slc23a1) of a rat ascorbic-acid transporter, Svct2 (ref. 4). Cultured embryonic fibroblasts from homozygous Slc23a1−/− mice had less than 5% of normal ascorbic-acid uptake. Ascorbic-acid levels were undetectable or markedly reduced in the blood and tissues of Slc23a1−/− mice. Prenatal supplementation of pregnant females did not elevate blood ascorbic acid in Slc23a1−/− fetuses, suggesting Slc23a1 is important in placental ascorbic-acid transport. Slc23a1−/− mice died within a few minutes of birth with respiratory failure and intraparenchymal brain hemorrhage. Lungs showed no postnatal expansion but had normal surfactant protein B levels. Brain hemorrhage was unlikely to be simply a form of scurvy since Slc23a1−/− mice showed no hemorrhage in any other tissues and their skin had normal skin 4-hydroxyproline levels despite low ascorbic-acid content. We conclude that Slc23a1 is required for transport of ascorbic acid into many tissues and across the placenta. Deficiency of the transporter is lethal in newborn mice, thereby revealing a previously unrecognized requirement for ascorbic acid in the perinatal period."

https://openalex.org/W1991533312,"One hypothesis that couples infection with autoimmune disease is molecular mimicry. Molecular mimicry is characterized by an immune response to an environmental agent that cross-reacts with a host antigen, resulting in disease. This hypothesis has been implicated in the pathogenesis of diabetes, lupus and multiple sclerosis (MS). There is limited direct evidence linking causative agents with pathogenic immune reactions in these diseases. Our study establishes a clear link between viral infection, autoimmunity and neurological disease in humans. As a model for molecular mimicry, we studied patients with human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1)-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP), a disease that can be indistinguishable from MS (refs. 5,6,7). HAM/TSP patients develop antibodies to neurons. We hypothesized these antibodies would identify a central nervous system (CNS) autoantigen. Immunoglobulin G isolated from HAM/TSP patients identified heterogeneous nuclear ribonuclear protein-A1 (hnRNP-A1) as the autoantigen. Antibodies to hnRNP-A1 cross-reacted with HTLV-1-tax, the immune response to which is associated with HAM/TSP (refs. 5,9). Immunoglobulin G specifically stained human Betz cells, whose axons are preferentially damaged. Infusion of autoantibodies in brain sections inhibited neuronal firing, indicative of their pathogenic nature. These data demonstrate the importance of molecular mimicry between an infecting agent and hnRNP-A1 in autoimmune disease of the CNS."

The xylem then transports the ions from roots to mature organs of the shoot with the transpiration stream. It is thought that organic acids such as citric acid chelate iron in order to increase its solubility in the xylem (2Stephan, U. W. (2002) Plant Soil, in pressGoogle Scholar). However, the development of young and growing organs depends essentially on micronutrient supply mediated by the sieve elements (3Atkins C. Aust. J. Plant Physiol. 2000; 27: 531-537Google Scholar). Reasons for this include the low transpiration rate of developing organs such as shoot apices and the inability of the still incompletely developed xylem vessels to provide the micronutrients required for proper growth (4Marschner H. Kirkby E.A. Engels C. Bot. Acta. 1997; 110: 265-273Crossref Scopus (135) Google Scholar).The phloem-mediated transport of iron and other micronutrients is well established, especially during periods of mineral deficiency and enhanced demand for micronutrients during flowering or seed filling (5Stephan U.W. Scholz G. Physiol. Plant. 1993; 88: 522-529Crossref Scopus (200) Google Scholar). The seedlings of castor bean are completely supplied with all micronutrients via the phloem during the first week of germination (6Schmidke I. Stephan U.W. Physiol. Plant. 1995; 95: 147-153Crossref Scopus (73) Google Scholar). However, the chemical association of these metals during phloem transport is still controversial. The physicochemical properties of transition metal micronutrients cause severe problems for the transport of their free ion forms in sieve tubes. The ions of iron, copper, manganese, and zinc are highly reactive species that require masking of their electrical charge in the cytoplasm and phloem. Iron in particular undergoes easily changes of valence, and its redox changes favor the generation of highly reactive oxygen species via the Fenton reaction (7Briat J.F. Inzé D. van Montagu M. Oxidative Stress in Plants. Taylor and Francis, London2002: 171-189Google Scholar). Moreover, Fe2+ and particularly Fe3+ are extremely insoluble at alkaline pH values. Since the prevalent pH of phloem sap is between pH 7 and 8, free iron would immediately precipitate with anionic phloem constituents (2Stephan, U. W. (2002) Plant Soil, in pressGoogle Scholar).It has been suggested that iron, manganese, copper, and zinc move principally in an ionic form (8Pate J.S. Zimmermann M.H. Milburn J.A. Phloem Transport. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1975: 451-473Google Scholar), whereas other authors have found manganese bound in an organic complex with a molecular mass of 1–1.5 kDa and zinc in a negatively charged complex (9Van Goor B.J. Wiersma D. Physiol. Plant. 1976; 36: 213-216Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar). A detailed characterization of these transport species was not reported. Iron has been suggested to travel in the phloem of castor bean (Ricinus communis L.) in a ferric complex with a molecular mass of 2.4 kDa (10Maas F.M. Van de Wetering D.A.M. Van Beusichem M.L. Bienfait H.F. Plant Physiol. 1988; 87: 167-171Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Specific chemical properties and observations of some transport characteristics favored the metal complexes of nicotianamine, a plant-endogenous chelator, as the transport species in sieve tubes (11Stephan U.W.

However, in the last few years an increasing number of findings indicated the involvement of peptides and/or proteins in the transport of iron and other micronutrients in the phloem (13Marentes, E., Stephens, B.

Plant Cell Environ. 1996; 19: 471-477Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar); we report the purification and cloning of the corresponding cDNA of a protein from phloem exudate that transports iron in vivo in the phloem and is able to bind iron, copper, manganese, and zinc in vitro. To the best of our knowledge, this finding represents the first molecular identification of a micronutrient transport protein from plant phloem.DISCUSSIONThe distribution of micronutrients to developing organs of plants depends to a great extent on phloem transport. The chemical properties of the free metal ions, in particular of iron, demand ligands that provide solubility and shielding during phloem-mediated long distance transport to the nutrient sinks. Until now, no such binding partner had been clearly identified. In this study, an iron transport protein has been purified from phloem exudates, and its cDNA has been cloned using Ricinus as a model for phloem transport analysis. The following evidence supports the conclusion that ITP is a transport species for iron in the phloem. 1) Essentially all iron in the phloem is associated with the high molecular weight fraction; 2) ITP-iron complexes rapidly appear in pure phloem exudate after feeding of cotyledons with 55Fe; 3) ITP carries ironin vivo and is able to bind additional iron in vitro; 4) purified ITP binds preferentially Fe3+, the dominant iron species in the phloem; and 5) the amino acid sequence of ITP suggests it is capable of binding several metal ions per molecule.When Ricinus cotyledons were fed with 55Fe or65Zn, the radioactivity obtained after transport through the sieve tubes was associated with different molecular size fractions, indicating separate ligands and transport mechanisms for the two micronutrients. This agrees with findings that describe a high affinity nickel- and zinc-binding peptide from pumpkin phloem sap with a molecular mass of 4 kDa (14Wang H.L. Stephens B.W. Grusak M.A. Abstracts of the American Society of Plant Physiology Annual Meeting. American Society of Plant Physiologists, 1999: 105Google Scholar). The reports of iron transport species of 2.4 and 2.8 kDa in phloem sap from pea and adult Ricinusplants (10Maas F.M. Van de Wetering D.A.M. Van Beusichem M.L. Bienfait H.F. Plant Physiol. 1988; 87: 167-171Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Marentes, E., Stephens, B. W., and Grusak, M. A. (1997)Abstracts of the 9th International Symposium on Iron Nutrition and Interaction in Plants, Stuttgart, Germany, July 20–25, 1997, p. 74Google Scholar) were not confirmed by our experiments. However, none of these peptides were further characterized until now.After electrophoretic separation of 55Fe-labeled sieve tube exudate, three signals were detected. Only one of them, which we called ITP, was consistently labeled in vivo and was able to bind additional iron in vitro. Although no protein was detected in either the high or the low molecular weight elutant in feeding experiments and no protein other than ITP was purified by immobilized metal affinity chromatography, the possibility cannot be excluded that other factors with different biochemical nature and properties contribute to iron transport in the phloem. The quick appearance of the ITP-55Fe complex at the distant exudation site after the beginning of feeding of cotyledons indicates that ITP was indeed responsible for iron transport and was already present in the seedling, as would be expected for a physiological function during germination. This also rules out any induction by the experimental set-up, such as wounding.Purified ITP showed a preference for Fe3+ but also bound zinc, copper, and manganese, whereas in vivo it only complexed with iron. The fact that 65Zn was exclusively associated with the low molecular weight fraction in feeding experiments suggests that the binding of ITP to zinc in vitro might be a consequence of the different chemical environment, such as pH and concentrations, or the absence of additional phloem ligands. Thus, the name iron-binding protein is justified, although the in vivo binding properties to copper and manganese are not known and could only be determined by feeding experiments with radioactive isotopes of these metals. Interestingly, ITP only weakly bound to columns loaded with Fe2+. This preference of ITP for ferric iron fits with the finding that only 4% of the total iron in the phloem exudate of castor bean seedling is ferrous iron (33Schmidke I. Krüger C. Frömmichen R. Scholz G. Stephan U.W. Physiol. Plant. 1999; 106: 82-89Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The apparent lack of ferrous iron binding points to a possible cooperation with the chelator nicotianamine in phloem loading and unloading of iron. The formation constant of the Fe(III)-nicotianamine complex of 20.6 (12Von Wirén N. Klair S. Bansal S. Briat J.F. Khodr H. Shioiri T. Leigh R.A. Hider R.C. Plant Physiol. 1999; 119: 1107-1114Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar) is higher than that of the Fe(II)-nicotianamine complex (12.8) (34Anderegg G. Ripperger H. J. Chem. Soc. Chem. Commun. 1989; 10: 647-650Crossref Google Scholar), but the Fe2+-nicotianamine complex possesses an unusual kinetic stability (12Von Wirén N. Klair S. Bansal S. Briat J.F. Khodr H. Shioiri T. Leigh R.A. Hider R.C. Plant Physiol. 1999; 119: 1107-1114Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). It is tempting to speculate that nicotianamine could play the role of a shuttle by chelation of Fe2+ from ITP-bound Fe3+ during loading and unloading, thereby maintaining a low but significant steady-state ferrous concentration in the phloem as suggested in Ref. 10Maas F.M. Van de Wetering D.A.M. Van Beusichem M.L. Bienfait H.F. Plant Physiol. 1988; 87: 167-171Crossref PubMed Google Scholar.Because of the function of ITP in micronutrient binding and iron transport, we purified the protein and cloned the corresponding full-length cDNA. The derived amino acid sequence included all three internal peptide sequences and thus proved that the experimentally demonstrated metal binding ability and the encoded protein are the same. The unusual amino acid composition of ITP suggests that the differences between apparent and predicted molecular weight and pI are due to altered gel mobility. ITP consists of only 14% nonpolar amino acids and might therefore exhibit aberrant electrophoretic behavior. Data base searches place ITP into a group that is collectively referred to as LEA/RAB/dehydrin proteins (35Galau G.A. Close T.J. Plant Physiol. 1992; 88: 1523-1525Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar), a family of highly hydrophilic proteins generally involved in dehydration processes (36Ingram J. Bartels D. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 47: 377-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (1757) Google Scholar, 37Garay-Arroyo A. Colmenero-Flores J.M. Garciarrubio A. Covarrubias A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5668-5674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Like many LEA proteins, ITP also lacks Cys and Trp residues. The highest homology of ITP was found with SRC1 from soybean, which is induced by high and low temperatures, drought, wounding, and viral infection in leaf and stem (30Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62983) Google Scholar). As in ITP, only four amino acids (Glu, His, Lys, and Gly) compose 75% of the SRC1 protein, which consists primarily of repeats of a degenerate tetrapeptide motif. This motif is also present in ITP, although not as often as in SRC1. The ITP gene is expressed in all seedling parts investigated. Interestingly, the expression in fully developed leaves suggests a transport function of ITP in adult plants as well.Metal binding has never been observed for members of the LEA protein family to date (32Cuming A.C. Shewry P.R. Casey R. Seed Proteins. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1999: 753-780Crossref Google Scholar); thus, our results describe a new function for this protein class. It is assumed that their polar composition and random structure enable them to bind water and act as compatible solutes (36Ingram J. Bartels D. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 47: 377-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (1757) Google Scholar,37Garay-Arroyo A. Colmenero-Flores J.M. Garciarrubio A. Covarrubias A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5668-5674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). The metal binding ability of ITP may be a consequence of the high abundance of the four amino acids mentioned. In particular, His constitutes 19% of the protein and may act like a polyhistidine tag used for protein fusion and subsequent nickel affinity purification. Indeed, ITP was able to bind to nickel affinity columns (data not shown). Amino acid comparison assigns ITP to group 2 of the LEA proteins, called dehydrins. However, homologous features are only partially conserved in ITP and are difficult to assess because of the strong variability of lengths and composition of the known dehydrins (32Cuming A.C. Shewry P.R. Casey R. Seed Proteins. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1999: 753-780Crossref Google Scholar). Further investigations will focus on the expression patterns of the ITP gene during ontogenesis, characterization of the metal binding affinity of the ITP protein, and the possible interaction with nicotianamine. The metal micronutrients iron, zinc, manganese, and copper are imported into plants by specific uptake systems in the plasmalemma of root cells (1Fox T.C. Guerinot M.L. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol.

The seedling of castor bean (R. communis L.) is an established model system for phloem analysis (2Stephan, U. W. (2002) Plant Soil, in pressGoogle Scholar, 16Kallarackal J. Orlich G. Schobert C. Komor E. Planta. 1989; 177: 327-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 17Zhong W. Hartung W. Komor E. Schobert C. Plant Cell Environ. 1996; 19: 471-477Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar); we report the purification and cloning of the corresponding cDNA of a protein from phloem exudate that transports iron in vivo in the phloem and is able to bind iron, copper, manganese, and zinc in vitro. To the best of our knowledge, this finding represents the first molecular identification of a micronutrient transport protein from plant phloem. DISCUSSIONThe distribution of micronutrients to developing organs of plants depends to a great extent on phloem transport. The chemical properties of the free metal ions, in particular of iron, demand ligands that provide solubility and shielding during phloem-mediated long distance transport to the nutrient sinks. Until now, no such binding partner had been clearly identified. In this study, an iron transport protein has been purified from phloem exudates, and its cDNA has been cloned using Ricinus as a model for phloem transport analysis. The following evidence supports the conclusion that ITP is a transport species for iron in the phloem. 1) Essentially all iron in the phloem is associated with the high molecular weight fraction; 2) ITP-iron complexes rapidly appear in pure phloem exudate after feeding of cotyledons with 55Fe; 3) ITP carries ironin vivo and is able to bind additional iron in vitro; 4) purified ITP binds preferentially Fe3+, the dominant iron species in the phloem; and 5) the amino acid sequence of ITP suggests it is capable of binding several metal ions per molecule.When Ricinus cotyledons were fed with 55Fe or65Zn, the radioactivity obtained after transport through the sieve tubes was associated with different molecular size fractions, indicating separate ligands and transport mechanisms for the two micronutrients. This agrees with findings that describe a high affinity nickel- and zinc-binding peptide from pumpkin phloem sap with a molecular mass of 4 kDa (14Wang H.L. Stephens B.W. Grusak M.A. Abstracts of the American Society of Plant Physiology Annual Meeting. American Society of Plant Physiologists, 1999: 105Google Scholar). The reports of iron transport species of 2.4 and 2.8 kDa in phloem sap from pea and adult Ricinusplants (10Maas F.M. Van de Wetering D.A.M. Van Beusichem M.L. Bienfait H.F. Plant Physiol. 1988; 87: 167-171Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Marentes, E., Stephens, B. W., and Grusak, M. A. (1997)Abstracts of the 9th International Symposium on Iron Nutrition and Interaction in Plants, Stuttgart, Germany, July 20–25, 1997, p. 74Google Scholar) were not confirmed by our experiments. However, none of these peptides were further characterized until now.After electrophoretic separation of 55Fe-labeled sieve tube exudate, three signals were detected. Only one of them, which we called ITP, was consistently labeled in vivo and was able to bind additional iron in vitro. Although no protein was detected in either the high or the low molecular weight elutant in feeding experiments and no protein other than ITP was purified by immobilized metal affinity chromatography, the possibility cannot be excluded that other factors with different biochemical nature and properties contribute to iron transport in the phloem. The quick appearance of the ITP-55Fe complex at the distant exudation site after the beginning of feeding of cotyledons indicates that ITP was indeed responsible for iron transport and was already present in the seedling, as would be expected for a physiological function during germination. This also rules out any induction by the experimental set-up, such as wounding.Purified ITP showed a preference for Fe3+ but also bound zinc, copper, and manganese, whereas in vivo it only complexed with iron. The fact that 65Zn was exclusively associated with the low molecular weight fraction in feeding experiments suggests that the binding of ITP to zinc in vitro might be a consequence of the different chemical environment, such as pH and concentrations, or the absence of additional phloem ligands. Thus, the name iron-binding protein is justified, although the in vivo binding properties to copper and manganese are not known and could only be determined by feeding experiments with radioactive isotopes of these metals. Interestingly, ITP only weakly bound to columns loaded with Fe2+. This preference of ITP for ferric iron fits with the finding that only 4% of the total iron in the phloem exudate of castor bean seedling is ferrous iron (33Schmidke I. Krüger C. Frömmichen R. Scholz G. Stephan U.W. Physiol. Plant. 1999; 106: 82-89Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The apparent lack of ferrous iron binding points to a possible cooperation with the chelator nicotianamine in phloem loading and unloading of iron. The formation constant of the Fe(III)-nicotianamine complex of 20.6 (12Von Wirén N. Klair S. Bansal S. Briat J.F. Khodr H. Shioiri T. Leigh R.A. Hider R.C. Plant Physiol. 1999; 119: 1107-1114Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar) is higher than that of the Fe(II)-nicotianamine complex (12.8) (34Anderegg G. Ripperger H. J. Chem. Soc. Chem. Commun. 1989; 10: 647-650Crossref Google Scholar), but the Fe2+-nicotianamine complex possesses an unusual kinetic stability (12Von Wirén N. Klair S. Bansal S. Briat J.F. Khodr H. Shioiri T. Leigh R.A. Hider R.C. Plant Physiol. 1999; 119: 1107-1114Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). It is tempting to speculate that nicotianamine could play the role of a shuttle by chelation of Fe2+ from ITP-bound Fe3+ during loading and unloading, thereby maintaining a low but significant steady-state ferrous concentration in the phloem as suggested in Ref. 10Maas F.M. Van de Wetering D.A.M. Van Beusichem M.L. Bienfait H.F. Plant Physiol. 1988; 87: 167-171Crossref PubMed Google Scholar.Because of the function of ITP in micronutrient binding and iron transport, we purified the protein and cloned the corresponding full-length cDNA. The derived amino acid sequence included all three internal peptide sequences and thus proved that the experimentally demonstrated metal binding ability and the encoded protein are the same. The unusual amino acid composition of ITP suggests that the differences between apparent and predicted molecular weight and pI are due to altered gel mobility. ITP consists of only 14% nonpolar amino acids and might therefore exhibit aberrant electrophoretic behavior. Data base searches place ITP into a group that is collectively referred to as LEA/RAB/dehydrin proteins (35Galau G.A. Close T.J. Plant Physiol. 1992; 88: 1523-1525Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar), a family of highly hydrophilic proteins generally involved in dehydration processes (36Ingram J. Bartels D. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 47: 377-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (1757) Google Scholar, 37Garay-Arroyo A. Colmenero-Flores J.M. Garciarrubio A. Covarrubias A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5668-5674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Like many LEA proteins, ITP also lacks Cys and Trp residues. The highest homology of ITP was found with SRC1 from soybean, which is induced by high and low temperatures, drought, wounding, and viral infection in leaf and stem (30Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62983) Google Scholar). As in ITP, only four amino acids (Glu, His, Lys, and Gly) compose 75% of the SRC1 protein, which consists primarily of repeats of a degenerate tetrapeptide motif. This motif is also present in ITP, although not as often as in SRC1. The ITP gene is expressed in all seedling parts investigated. Interestingly, the expression in fully developed leaves suggests a transport function of ITP in adult plants as well.Metal binding has never been observed for members of the LEA protein family to date (32Cuming A.C. Shewry P.R. Casey R. Seed Proteins. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1999: 753-780Crossref Google Scholar); thus, our results describe a new function for this protein class. It is assumed that their polar composition and random structure enable them to bind water and act as compatible solutes (36Ingram J. Bartels D. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 47: 377-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (1757) Google Scholar,37Garay-Arroyo A. Colmenero-Flores J.M. Garciarrubio A. Covarrubias A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5668-5674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). The metal binding ability of ITP may be a consequence of the high abundance of the four amino acids mentioned. In particular, His constitutes 19% of the protein and may act like a polyhistidine tag used for protein fusion and subsequent nickel affinity purification. Indeed, ITP was able to bind to nickel affinity columns (data not shown). Amino acid comparison assigns ITP to group 2 of the LEA proteins, called dehydrins. However, homologous features are only partially conserved in ITP and are difficult to assess because of the strong variability of lengths and composition of the known dehydrins (32Cuming A.C. Shewry P.R. Casey R. Seed Proteins. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1999: 753-780Crossref Google Scholar). Further investigations will focus on the expression patterns of the ITP gene during ontogenesis, characterization of the metal binding affinity of the ITP protein, and the possible interaction with nicotianamine.

https://openalex.org/W2088129599,"Hydrogen peroxide is implicated as an intracellular messenger in various cellular responses such as proliferation and differentiation. Peroxiredoxin (Prx) I is a member of the peroxiredoxin family of peroxidases and contains a consensus site (Thr90-Pro-Lys-Lys) for phosphorylation by cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs). This protein has now been shown to be phosphorylated specifically on Thr90 by several CDKs, including Cdc2, in vitro. Phosphorylation of Prx I on Thr90 reduced the peroxidase activity of this protein by 80%. The phosphorylation of Prx I in HeLa cells was monitored with the use of antibodies specific for Prx I phosphorylated on Thr90. Immunoblot analysis with these antibodies of HeLa cells arrested at various stages of the cell cycle revealed that Prx I phosphorylation occurs in parallel with the activation of Cdc2; Prx I phosphorylation was thus marked during mitosis but virtually undetectable during interphase. Furthermore, when Cdc2 expression was reduced by RNA interference with cognate small interfering RNAs, Prx I phosphorylation was not observed in the cells synchronized in mitotic phase. The cytosolic location of Prx I likely prevents its interaction with activated CDKs until after the breakdown of the nuclear envelope during mitosis, when Cdc2 is the CDK that is most active. Phosphorylation of Prx I on Thr90 both in vitroand in vivo was blocked by roscovitine, an inhibitor of CDKs. These results suggest that Cdc2-mediated phosphorylation and inactivation of Prx I and the resulting intracellular accumulation of H2O2 might be important for progression of the cell cycle.

However, the inactivation of protein-tyrosine phosphatases by H2O2 produced in response to receptor activation is mediated by the specific oxidation of their essential cysteine residues. The oxidized phosphatases are reactivated by cellular reductants after the concentration of H2O2 returns to normal (9Lee S.R. Kwon K.S. Kim S.R. Rhee S.G. J. Biol.

The timely elimination of second messengers, such as cyclic nucleotides and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, after the completion of their functions is important for efficient signaling. Thus, in general, both the production and the elimination of second messengers are strictly controlled. Control of the elimination of H2O2is likely especially important given that this molecule is readily converted to the destructive hydroxyl radical. Enzymes capable of eliminating H2O2 include catalase, glutathione peroxidase, and peroxiredoxin (Prx).1 There is no evidence to suggest that the activities of catalase and glutathione peroxidase are regulated. Members of the Prx family of peroxidases are present in organisms from all kingdoms (13Chae H.Z. Chung S.J. Rhee S.G. J. Biol.

All Prx enzymes contain a conserved cysteine residue in the NH2-terminal region that is the primary site of oxidation by H2O2. At least six Prx enzymes are present in mammals, and these proteins can be divided into three subgroups referred to as 2-Cys, atypical 2-Cys, and 1-Cys (14Rhee S.G. Kang S.W. Chang T.-S. Jeong W.

The 2-Cys isozymes (Prx I, II, III, and IV) contain an additional conserved cysteine in the COOH-terminal region, whereas the atypical 2-Cys (Prx V) and the 1-Cys (Prx VI) isozymes do not. The amino acid sequence homology among the three subgroups is low (<20% identity), whereas that among the members of the 2-Cys subgroup is relatively high (60–80% identity).

When overexpressed in various cell types, Prx enzymes efficiently reduced the increase in the intracellular concentration of H2O2 induced by platelet-derived growth factor or tumor necrosis factor-α, inhibited the activation of NF-κB induced by tumor necrosis factor-α, and blocked apoptosis induced by ceramide (19Kang S.W.

Although they are implicated in intracellular signaling, the activity of Prx enzymes has not previously been shown to be regulated in response to cell stimulation, as is the case with many other enzymes that catalyze the metabolism of second messengers. In the present study, we demonstrate that purified Prx I is phosphorylated on Thr90 by cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), including Cdc2 (also known as CDK1), resulting in a marked inhibition of the peroxidase activity of Prx I. Furthermore, Prx I phosphorylation in HeLa, HepG2, and NIH 3T3 cells was apparent during mitosis but not during interphase. These results suggest that Cdc2, the CDK that is activated during mitosis, is responsible for Prx I phosphorylation in intact cells and that the accumulation of H2O2that results from the inactivation of Prx I might be important for progression of the cell cycle. A monoclonal antibody to Cdc2 and rabbit antibodies to other CDKs (CDK2, CDK4, and CDK6) were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, and the purified recombinant Cdc2-cyclin B complex was from New England Biolabs.

The construction of a bacterial expression plasmid for human Prx I (pET-Prx I) was described previously (19Kang S.W. Chae H.Z. Seo M.S. Kim K. Baines I.C. Rhee S.G. J. Biol.

Mutation of Thr90 of Prx I to alanine (Prx I T90A) or to aspartate (Prx I T90D) was performed by polymerase chain reaction-mediated site-directed mutagenesis with pET-Prx I as the template. E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells were transformed with the wild-type or mutant pET-Prx I plasmids, and the encoded proteins were purified from bacterial extracts as described (19Kang S.W. Chae H.Z. Seo M.S.

Recombinant Prx I (250 μg) was incubated for 6 h at 30 °C with 100 ng of the purified Cdc2-cyclin B complex in a final volume of 500 μl containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μm ATP, and 50 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. Phosphorylated Prx I was separated from the unphosphorylated protein by diluting the reaction mixture with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.5) and applying the resulting solution to a Q-Sepharose column that had been equilibrated with 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 8.5). The proteins were eluted from the column with 500 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.5) containing 0.3m NaCl. HeLa cells were cultured in Dulbecco's minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 units/ml). The cells were arrested in the mitotic phase of the cell cycle by exposure to nocodazole as described (25Morla A.O. Draetta G. Beach D. Wang J.Y. Cell. 1989; 58: 193-203Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). In brief, they were incubated with nocodazole (200 ng/ml) for 16 h, after which the culture dishes were shaken, and floating cells (∼50% of total cells) were harvested. After washing twice with phosphate-buffered saline, the cells were cultured in nocodazole-free medium to induce release from mitotic arrest. HeLa cells were synchronized at the G1-S transition of the cell cycle by the thymidine double-block method (26Krek W. DeCaprio J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 254: 114-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) with some modifications. In brief, HeLa cells in the exponential growth phase were exposed to 2 mm thymidine for 16 h, released into thymidine-free medium for 9 h, and then re-exposed to 2 mm thymidine for 14 h. The block was released by transfer of cells to thymidine-free medium. Approximately 1 × 106cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and then fixed overnight at 4 °C in 70% ethanol. Immediately before flow cytometry, the cells were resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline containing propidium iodide (50 μg/ml) and DNase-free RNase (10 μg/ml). Flow cytometry was performed with a Coulter Epics XL instrument (Beckman Coulter). HeLa cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and then lysed for 10 min at 4 °C in a solution containing 25 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.4), 2 mm EGTA, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm Na3VO4, 5 mm NaF, 1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzene-sulfonyl fluoride, aprotinin (10 μg/ml), leupeptin (10 μg/ml), and 25 nm microcystin. The lysate was centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 10 min, and the protein concentration of the resulting supernatant was measured with a Bradford assay before experiments. Recombinant Prx I, II, III, or IV (2 μg each) was phosphorylated by the purified recombinant Cdc2-cyclin B complex (10 ng) in a final volume of 30 μl containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 100 μm ATP, and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. The reaction mixture was incubated for the indicated times at 30 °C, after which proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE on a 12% gel. The radioactivity associated with protein bands was quantified by PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics) analysis. The phosphorylation of 1 μg of Prx I or histone H1 was also performed with immunoprecipitated CDKs under the same reaction conditions as those described above. HeLa cell lysates (0.1–1 mg of protein) were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with 15 μl of protein G-Sepharose beads with constant rotation. After removal of the beads by centrifugation, the resulting supernatants were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with 1 μg of a monoclonal antibody to Cdc2 or with 4 μg of rabbit antibodies to CDK2, CDK4, or CDK6. The immune complexes were recovered by further incubation for 1 h at 4 °C with 15 μl of protein G-Sepharose beads and subsequent separation of the beads by centrifugation. The beads were washed twice with cell lysis buffer and twice with washing buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA) before use as the source of kinase. Rabbits were injected with keyhole limpet hemocyanin conjugated to the phosphopeptide CHLAWVNT(PO4)PKKQG, which corresponds to residues 83–95 of human Prx I. To remove antibodies that recognized the corresponding unphosphorylated peptide, we applied serum subsequently obtained from the rabbits to Sepharose 4B resin conjugated with the unphosphorylated peptide. The unbound fraction was further purified by collection of the antibodies that bound to Sepharose 4B conjugated with the phosphopeptide. The resulting monospecific antibodies were used for immunoblot analysis of phosphorylated Prx I. The small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) that target human Cdc2 were based on the coding regions 125–147 relative to the first nucleotide of the start codon as described previously (27Harborth J. Elbashir S.M. Bechert K. Tuschl T. Weber K. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 4557-4565Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), purchased from Dharmacon (Lafayette, CO) in purified and annealed form, and transfected as described (28Elbashir S.M. Harborth J. Lendeckel W. Yalcin A. Weber K. Tuschl T. Nature. 2001; 411: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (8158) Google Scholar). Briefly, the day before transfection, HeLa cells were trypsinized, diluted with fresh medium without antibiotics, and transferred to 24-well plates (500 μl/well). Transient transfection of siRNAs was performed using OligofectAMINE (Invitrogen). 12 μl of OptiMEM medium/well (Invitrogen) and 3 μl of OligofectAMINE/well were preincubated for 10 min at room temperature. During the time for this incubation 50 μl of OptiMEM medium were mixed with 3 μl of 20 μm siRNA. The two mixtures were combined and incubated for 20 min at room temperature for complex formation. After the addition of 32 μl of OptiMEM medium to the mixture, the entire mixture was added to the cells in one well resulting in a final concentration of 100 nm for the siRNAs. The peroxidase activity of Prx I was measured as described (29Chae H.Z. Kang S.W. Rhee S.G. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 300: 219-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). In brief, the initial rate of NADPH oxidation was monitored spectrophotometrically at 30 °C in a reaction mixture (200 μl) containing 50 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.0), 0.2 mmNADPH, 50 nm Trx reductase, 5 μm Trx, 0.1 mm H2O2, and 4 μg of Prx I. We noticed that the amino acid sequences of the 2-Cys Prx enzymes from human, rat, and mouse all contain the consensus sequence, (Ser/Thr)-Pro-Xaa-(Lys/Arg), for phosphorylation by CDKs; these sequences are Thr-Pro-Lys-Lys for Prx I, Thr-Pro-Arg-Lys for Prx II and Prx III, and Thr-Pro-Arg-Arg for Prx IV. Neither Prx V nor Prx VI contains such a consensus sequence (30Kennelly P.J. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15555-15558Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Moreno S. Nurse P. Cell. 1990; 61: 549-551Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). The putative phosphorylation site Thr, which in human Prx I is Thr90, is located 38 residues downstream of the NH2-terminal conserved cysteine in all four 2-Cys Prx enzymes. To determine whether CDKs are able to catalyze the phosphorylation of 2-Cys Prx enzymes, we subjected purified Prx I, II, III, and IV to an in vitrokinase assay with a recombinant Cdc2-cyclin B complex in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP. Prx I was phosphorylated most efficiently by Cdc2-cyclin B, followed by Prx II, Prx III, and Prx IV in decreasing order of susceptibility to phosphorylation (Fig.1 A). Similar results were obtained when the four Prx proteins were phosphorylated by Cdc2 immunoprecipitated from HeLa cell lysates (data not shown). Prx I was also phosphorylated, with an efficiency similar to that observed with Cdc2, when incubated in vitro with CDK2, CDK4, or CDK6 that had been immunoprecipitated from HeLa cell lysates with specific antibodies (data not shown). Given that Prx I is also the most abundant of the four 2-Cys Prx enzymes in HeLa cells (14Rhee S.G. Kang S.W. Chang T.-S. Jeong W. Kim K. IUBMB Life. 2001; 52: 1-7Crossref Scopus (518) Google Scholar, 32Chae H.Z. Kim H.J. Kang S.W. Rhee S.G. Diabetes Res. Clin. Pract. 1999; 45: 101-112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar) and that the mitochondrial protein Prx III and the extracellular protein Prx IV do not likely have the opportunity to interact with CDKs, we focused our subsequent studies on Prx I. Phosphorylation of Prx I by immunoprecipitated Cdc2 was prevented by 2 μm roscovitine (Fig. 1 B), a potent and selective inhibitor of several CDKs including Cdc2 (33Meijer L. Borgne A. Mulner O. Chong J.P. Blow J.J. Inagaki N. Inagaki M. Delcros J.G. Moulinoux J.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 243: 527-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (1204) Google Scholar). To verify the site of phosphorylation of Prx I by Cdc2, we subjected both wild-type Prx I and the mutant Prx I T90A, in which Thr90 is replaced by alanine, to the in vitro kinase assay with the purified Cdc2-cyclin B complex. In contrast to the marked phosphorylation of the wild-type protein, phosphorylation of Prx I T90A was undetectable (Fig.1 C), indicating that Thr90 is the only site of Prx I phosphorylated by Cdc2. To facilitate the monitoring of Prx I phosphorylation in intact cells, we prepared antibodies specific for Prx I phosphorylated on Thr90 by injecting rabbits with a 13-residue phosphopeptide corresponding to residues 83–95 of Thr90-phosphorylated human Prx I. The resulting antiserum was subjected to selection for antibodies that bind to the phosphorylated 13-residue peptide but not to the corresponding unphosphorylated peptide. The specificity of the purified antibodies was assessed by performing in vitro kinase reactions with purified Prx I and Cdc2-cyclin B in the absence or presence of [γ-32P]ATP. The resulting 32P-labeled Prx I and unphosphorylated Prx I were combined in various ratios, and then equal amounts of the Prx I protein combinations were subjected to autoradiography or to immunoblot analysis either with the monospecific antibodies to Thr90-phosphorylated Prx I (P-Prx I) or with antibodies to Prx I (Fig. 2). The intensities of the P-Prx I band detected by the monospecific antibodies and by autoradiography decreased in parallel as the mole fraction of P-Prx I decreased, suggesting that the antibodies are indeed specific for P-Prx I. Of the other three 2-Cys Prx proteins, Prx II exhibits the greatest sequence homology to Prx I. However, the amino acid sequence of Prx II in the region corresponding to the 13-residue peptide of Prx I used as the antigen for preparation of the monospecific antibodies differs from that of Prx I by four residues, and Prx II phosphorylated by Cdc2 weakly reacted with the antibodies to P-Prx I (data not shown). To examine whether Prx I is phosphorylated on Thr90 in intact cells, we took advantage of the fact that okadaic acid, an inhibitor of type 1 and type 2A serine-threonine protein phosphatases, activates Cdc2 by inducing phosphorylation of Cdc25 (34Rime H. Jessus C. Ozon R. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 219: 29-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 35Yamashita K. Yasuda H. Pines J. Yasumoto K. Nishitani H. Ohtsubo M. Hunter T. Sugimura T. Nishimoto T. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 4331-4338Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). We also reasoned that okadaic acid might induce the accumulation of P-Prx I molecules by inhibiting their dephosphorylation. We therefore exposed HeLa cells to various concentrations (0–25 nm) of okadaic acid for 24 h, after which Cdc2 was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates and assayed for kinase activity with histone H1 as substrate. The presence of P-Prx I in the cell lysates was also evaluated by immunoblot analysis with the monospecific antibodies (Fig.3 A). Both the kinase activity of Cdc2 and the amount of P-Prx I immunoreactivity increased as the concentration of okadaic acid to which the cells were exposed increased. Okadaic acid has previously been shown to block cell cycle progression during the G2-M phase (36Schonthal A. Feramisco J.R. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 433-441PubMed Google Scholar, 37You J. Bird R.C. J. Cell. Physiol. 1995; 164: 424-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). We examined the effect of this agent on the cell cycle in HeLa cells by flow cytometric analysis of cellular DNA content. Control HeLa cells in the exponential phase of growth were distributed in the G1, S, and G2-M phases in the ratio 60:23:17. The cell cycle distribution remained virtually unchanged for cells exposed to 5 or 10 nm okadaic acid; however, the percentage of cells arrested in G2-M increased from 17 or 18% for those exposed to 0, 5, or 10 nm okadaic acid to 35, 58, and 57% for those treated with 15, 20, or 25 nm okadaic acid, respectively (Fig.3 B). The similarity in the dependence of Cdc2 activation, P-Prx I accumulation, and G2-M arrest on okadaic acid concentration suggested that Prx I is phosphorylated in cells by Cdc2, the activation of which is required for entry into mitosis. To investigate further the phosphorylation status of Prx I during cell cycle progression, we subjected proliferating HeLa cells to mitotic arrest with nocodazole. The cells were then released from mitotic arrest and, at various times thereafter, subjected to assay of the kinase activity of Cdc2, to immunoblot analysis of P-Prx I, and to flow cytometric analysis of DNA content. The detached cells collected 16 h after the onset of nocodazole treatment appeared to be arrested in mitosis as evidenced by a high level of Cdc2 kinase activity and the observation that 93% of the cells had a fully replicated complement of DNA (Fig.4 A). Prx I in the mitotically arrested cells was highly phosphorylated on Thr90, whereas phosphorylation of this residue of Prx I was virtually undetectable in asynchronous cells (Fig. 4 A). Release of the arrested cells by incubation in nocodazole-free medium resulted in cell cycle progression into G1 phase; the percentage of cells in G1 increased from 4% of the arrested cells to 6, 15, and 39% of cells 1, 2, and 4 h after release, respectively. As the cells progressed into G1, the kinase activity of Cdc2 as well as the amount of P-Prx I decreased, suggesting that Prx I phosphorylation occurs in the M phase but not in the G1phase. Phosphorylation of Prx I on Thr90 was also observed in NIH 3T3 and HepG2 cells that had been subjected to mitotic arrest with nocodazole (data not shown). We also subjected HeLa cells to synchronization at the G1-S transition by the thymidine double-block method and then released the synchronized cells from arrest by the addition of thymidine-free medium. Both the kinase activity of Cdc2 and the amount of P-Prx I were virtually undetectable in both asynchronous cells and cells arrested at G1-S. Furthermore, Cdc2 kinase activity and phosphorylation of Prx I remained undetectable in cells released from arrest, despite the fact that the percentage of cells in S phase increased from 31% of the arrested cells to 51, 54, and 69% of cells 1, 2, and 4 h after release, respectively. These results suggest that Prx I is not phosphorylated during S phase. The abundance of Prx I remained relatively constant during progression of cells through the various stages of the cell cycle (Fig. 4 B). The extent of Prx I phosphorylation was estimated in HeLa cells that had been synchronized in mitotic phase with nocodazole treatment. To prepare standard samples to which Prx I from the mitotic HeLa cells can be compared, purified recombinant Prx I was phosphorylated by Cdc2-cyclin B in vitro in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP. On the basis of the amount of32P radioactivity associated with Prx I, the extent of phosphorylation was determined to be ∼10% of the maximal level (data not shown). The HeLa cell lysates, along with in vitrophosphorylated Prx I, were subjected to immunoblot analyses with antibodies to P-Prx I and Prx I (Fig. 5). From comparison of their immunoblot intensities, the percentage of phosphorylated Prx I in the mitotic HeLa cells was estimated to be ∼12%. The effect of roscovitine on Prx I phosphorylation was also examined in HeLa cells. HeLa cells that had been subjected to mitotic arrest with nocodazole were exposed for 1 h to various concentrations of roscovitine (Fig. 6). As expected, roscovitine inhibited the kinase activity of Cdc2 in a concentration-dependent manner. In parallel with its effect on Cdc2 activity, roscovitine also reduced the level of Prx I phosphorylation on Thr90. These results indicate that Prx I phosphorylation in mitotic cells is reversible and that once P-Prx I becomes dephosphorylated, its rephosphorylation is slower in roscovitine-treated cells than in untreated cells. To provide more definite proof that Cdc2 phosphorylates Prx I during the M phase, we employed siRNA-mediated interference (28Elbashir S.M. Harborth J. Lendeckel W. Yalcin A. We"

Early on, AD presents clinically as impaired memory formation, yet despite intensive study, the mechanisms underlying AD-related memory dysfunction remain mysterious. Familial AD is associated with several risk factors, the best correlated being age and the inheritance of specific genes (mutations or allele type) that predominantly result in increased β-amyloid peptide (Aβ) levels (1Kuo Y.M.

Sci. 1996; 777: 226-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Despite intensive study, the mechanism by which elevated Aβ leads to AD-related hippocampal dysfunction remains mysterious, not to mention the lack of an understanding of the normal physiologic role for Aβ in synaptic function and signal transduction. As yet, a receptor for Aβ that is capable of influencing synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus remains unidentified. Cholinergic connections between the hippocampus and cortical structures within the temporal lobe and the cortical cholinergic system that originates within the basal forebrain are selectively vulnerable in the course of AD (9Bowen D.M. Smith C.B. White P. Davison A.N. Brain. 1976; 99: 459-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (1028) Google Scholar, 10Davies P. Maloney A.J. Lancet. 1976; 2: 1403Abstract PubMed Scopus (2827) Google Scholar, 11Perry E.K. Perry R.H. Blessed G. Tomlinson B.E. Lancet. 1977; 1: 189Abstract PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar). The loss of proper functioning of these neuronal populations is thought to underlie the loss of memory in AD patients (12Bartus R.T. Dean 3rd, R.L. Beer B. Lippa A.S. Science. 1982; 217: 408-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (4805) Google Scholar, 13Bartus R.T. Exp. Neurol. 2000; 163: 495-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar). The α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) is highly expressed on neurons of hippocampus and cholinergic projection neurons from the basal forebrain. A number of recent studies have convincingly demonstrated an interaction between the α7 nAChR and Aβ in vitro and on neurons. For instance, it has been shown that Aβ42 co-immunoprecipitates with the α7 nAChR in samples from postmortem AD hippocampus and that α7 nAChR antagonists compete for Aβ42 binding to heterologously expressed α7 nAChRs (14Wang H.Y. Lee D.H. D'Andrea M.R. Peterson P.A. Shank R.P. Reitz A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5626-5632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar). Furthermore, preincubation with Aβ42 antagonizes the activation of α7 nAChR-like currents in hippocampal neurons, and Aβ42, acting through α7 nAChRs, can elicit extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) MAPK activation in hippocampal cultures (15Pettit D.L. Shao Z. Yakel J.L. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: RC120Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Liu Q. Kawai H. Berg D.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4734-4739Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). This last observation is likely triggered by Ca2+ influx; α7 nAChRs are highly permeable to this pluripotent second messenger (17Seguela P. Wadiche J. Dineley-Miller K. Dani J.A. Patrick J.W. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 596-604Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We tested the hypothesis that Aβ could directly activate the α7 nAChR by expressing these receptors in Xenopus oocytes and performing two-electrode voltage clamp recordings following perfusion with pm to nm concentrations of non-aggregate Aβ. Both Aβ40 and Aβ42 were capable of eliciting inward currents from α7 nAChR-expressing oocytes; however, the current amplitudes resulting from Aβ42 receptor activation were much larger than those generated by Aβ40. Inward currents elicited by Aβ42 were comprised of Ca2+, were blocked by the α7 nAChR-selective antagonist methyllycaconatine (MLA), and were cross-desensitized by the α7 nAChR-selective agent 4OH-GTS-21. We obtained evidence that low concentrations of Aβ42 are highly desensitizing; wash times up to 30 min were unsuccessful at allowing subsequent Aβ42 activation. Desensitization induced by low concentrations of Aβ42 did not have an observable effect on subsequent nicotine stimulation. However, prolonged exposure to a high concentration of Aβ42 led to cross-desensitization of nicotine responses, suggesting the existence of more than one Aβ42 binding site or an Aβ42-induced conformation that differentially interferes with nicotine activation of α7 nAChRs. Overall, we conclude that Aβ42 is a high affinity ligand for α7 nAChRs that is capable of gating Ca2+ flux through the channel. Xenopus leavis (Nasco) oocytes were harvested and prepared for injection as described (17Seguela P. Wadiche J. Dineley-Miller K. Dani J.A. Patrick J.W. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 596-604Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Rat α7 nAChR cDNA or rat α7 nAChR cDNA containing the point mutation L250T, both contained in the cytomegalovirus expression vector pcDNAI/Amp (Invitrogen), were utilized for electrophysiology. α7 nAChR cDNAs were obtained from the laboratory of Dr. Jim Patrick. Stage VI oocytes were injected intranuclearly with 10–20 ng of cDNA 1 day following harvest using a Drummond nanoinjector. Oocytes were maintained at 17 °C in SOS medium (100 mmNaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and 25 μg/ml gentamicin) prior to recording. Membrane currents were recorded from oocytes 3–7 days post-injection. Oocytes were bathed at a rate of 10 ml/min in the recording chamber with oocyte Ringer's solution (115 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.2) except for experiments using Ca2+-free Ringer's solution in which 1.8 mm BaCl2 was substituted. Drugs and peptides used were: MLA (Sigma), nicotine tartrate (Sigma), 3-(4-hydroxy,2-methoxybenzylidene)anabaseine (4-OH-GTS-21 (18Meyer E.M. Kuryatov A. Gerzanich V. Lindstrom J. Papke R.L. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1998; 287: 918-925PubMed Google Scholar)) generously provided by Dr. Roger Papke, University of Florida), human Aβ-(1–40) and the reverse peptide (40–1; Sigma), rat Aβ-(1–42) (Calbiochem). 100 μm stocks of Aβ were prepared to promote solubility and to retard fibril formation, as described (19Dineley K.T. Westerman M. Bui D. Bell K. Ashe K.H. Sweatt J.D. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 4125-4133Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); all compounds were diluted in Ringer's solution prior to electrophysiological recordings. Two-electrode voltage clamp was performed at ambient temperature utilizing an Axoclamp-2A amplifier. Current and voltage pipettes were filled with 3 m KCl, and resistances ranged from 0.1 to 0.5 megaohms. Oocytes were voltage-clamped at −60 mV unless otherwise stated. Oocytes with resting membrane potentials between−20 and −60 mV and voltage clamp injections of less than 100 nA were used. Solution exchange was achieved by using electromagnetic valves (type 1; General Valve Corp.). Data were collected at a rate of 1.667 and 5 kHz for 30- and 5-s drug applications, respectively. Data acquisition and analysis was performed with pCLAMP software (Axon Instruments, Inc.). Current amplitudes were determined by measuring the maximum negative deflection from baseline. Data normalized and reported as percent of nicotine response correct for variations in channel expression by individual oocytes. We observed variability in the nicotine response, a portion of which could have been due to the previously reported increase in α7 nAChR responses following the initial application of agonist (20de Fiebre C.M. Meyer E.M. Henry J.C. Muraskin S.I. Kem W.R. Papke R.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 164-171PubMed Google Scholar); therefore oocytes received at least two control applications of nicotine separated by 5 min at the start of recording with the average of those responses used for normalization. Oocytes injected with wild-type α7 nAChR cDNA were tested for positive expression by performing a test perfusion with 100 μm nicotine. Oocytes injected with L250T mutant α7 nAChR cDNA were tested for positive expression by performing a test perfusion with 1 or 10 μm nicotine. Oocytes displaying inward currents of at least 100 nA in response to nicotine were used in experiments. Our work utilized rat Aβ42 peptide that was prepared under conditions to retard aggregation and fibrillization (21Burdick D. Soreghan B. Kwon M. Kosmoski J. Knauer M. Henschen A. Yates J. Cotman C. Glabe C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 546-554Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Garzon-Rodriguez W. Sepulveda-Becerra M. Milton S. Glabe C.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21037-21044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). We tested our Aβ42 preparations for aggregation in a Congo red assay. At the concentrations used and under the incubation conditions tested, none of the Aβ42 preparations significantly pelleted out of solution with Congo red dye at 2.5 or 25 μm (data not shown (23Brining S.K. Neurobiol. Aging. 1997; 18: 581-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar)). The ability of low concentrations of non-fibrillar Aβ42 to activate α7 nAChRs was tested by expressing these receptors in the Xenopus oocyte expression system and performing two-electrode voltage clamp recordings. Oocytes positive for α7 nAChR expression, as determined with a 5-s perfusion of 100 μm nicotine, were washed for 5 min with Ringer's solution and then subjected to a 5-s perfusion with 10 pmAβ42. This concentration of Aβ42 led to inward currents that averaged 44 ± 12 nA (−60-mV holding potential, n= 8) or 176 ± 76 nA (−100-mV holding potential,n = 4) in amplitude (Fig.1 a). Prior activation with nicotine was not necessary to observe Aβ42-induced responses. We observed receptor activation following Aβ42 perfusion on oocytes that had not yet been exposed to any other α7 nAChR agonist. Furthermore, we did not observe measurable current responses when mock-injected oocytes were subjected to Aβ42 perfusion (n = 12, data not shown). We also tested whether the far more abundant form of amyloid peptide, Aβ40, was capable of activating α7 nAChRs expressed by Xenopus oocytes. 10 pm human Aβ40 generated inward currents from α7 nAChR-expressing oocytes. However, the peak current amplitudes were much smaller than an equivalent concentration of Aβ42; the normalized Aβ40 currents were less than 20% of those generated with Aβ42. 10 pm Aβ40 elicited 10.13 ± 1.88 nA peak current, which is 1.75 ± 0.64% of the 100 μm nicotine response (n = 8, data not shown). Finally, the reverse (human 40–1) peptide failed to induce α7 nAChR activation (n = 10, data not shown). These experiments demonstrate that Aβ42, as well as Aβ40, is a selective and high affinity agonist for α7 nAChRs expressed in oocytes. Next, we evaluated whether we could generate α7 nAChR activation with repeated application of Aβ42. Repeated activation of α7 nAChRs with nicotine could be achieved by performing 5-min washes between drug perfusions. In contrast, following a 5-s perfusion with 10 pm Aβ42 that yielded a current response, we were unable to measure a second Aβ42 response (Fig. 1 b). This was the case for wash times of up to 30 min. Interestingly, at this low concentration of Aβ42, loss of the Aβ response did not interfere with the nicotine response. Perfusion with 100 μmnicotine within 1 min of perfusion with the second application of Aβ42 resulted in a nicotine response that was indistinguishable from the nicotine test application (n = 5; Fig.1 b). Clearly, the activation properties of low concentrations of Aβ42 and of 100 μm nicotine on α7 nAChRs are different. Previous reports have demonstrated Aβ42 antagonism of α7 nAChRs expressed by neurons (15Pettit D.L. Shao Z. Yakel J.L. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: RC120Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Liu Q. Kawai H. Berg D.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4734-4739Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). These studies utilized high concentrations (100 nm-1 μm) of Aβ42 and tested α7 nAChR responses following preincubation with the peptide. We therefore attempted to cross-desensitize the nicotine response of α7 nAChRs expressed by oocytes with 100 nmAβ42. A 2-min preincubation (co-application of nicotine and Aβ42 did not antagonize the receptor response) with 100 nmAβ42 inhibited the responses of the receptors to subsequent 100 μm nicotine application (53.2 ± 4.9%;n = 11; Fig. 1 c). These results are consistent with the published reports that 100 nm and 1 μm Aβ42 antagonize ∼60–80% of neuronal α7 nAChR responses to agonist (15Pettit D.L. Shao Z. Yakel J.L. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: RC120Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Liu Q. Kawai H. Berg D.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4734-4739Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). We next demonstrated that the Aβ42 effect could be blocked by the α7 nAChR-selective antagonist, MLA. Fig.2 a shows a representative experiment from nine replications in which MLA blocked both the nicotine and 10 pm Aβ42 response from an oocyte expressing α7 nAChRs. Recovery of the nicotine response follows a 10-min washout with Ringer's solution (response to a second application of Aβ42 was not attempted, but see the following GTS results). Likewise, preincubation (5 min) with the α7 nAChR-selective agent 4-OH-GTS-21 (3 or 30 μm) cross-desensitized the ability of Aβ42 to activate α7 nAChRs on oocytes (representative ofn = 13; Fig. 2 b). Following positive responses to first nicotine and then to 4-OH-GTS-21, a 5-min perfusion with 4-OH-GTS-21 prevented subsequent activation of α7 nAChRs with 10 pm Aβ42. A 10-min washout with Ringer's solution restored the Aβ42-induced current. 4-OH-GTS-21 cross-desensitized nicotine responses as well (data not shown). The fact that a response to a second application of Aβ42 was observed after washout suggests that 4-OH-GTS-21 binding prevents Aβ42 binding and that the two binding sites overlap. These experiments further demonstrate that Aβ42 is a selective agonist for α7 nAChRs expressed in oocytes. We utilized the desensitization-resistant mutant L250T α7 nAChR to exploit the large amplitude currents generated by this receptor type (30Revah F. Bertrand D. Galzi J.L. Devillers-Thiery A. Mulle C. Hussy N. Bertrand S. Ballivet M. Changeux J.P. Nature. 1991; 353: 846-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar, 31Bertrand D. Devillers-Thiery A. Revah F. Galzi J.L. Hussy N. Mulle C. Bertrand S. Ballivet M. Changeux J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1261-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Following a test application of 1 μm nicotine and a 5-min wash with Ringer's solution, 10 pm Aβ42 was perfused for 30 s, which resulted in a substantial inward current (1606 ± 280 nA,n = 28; Fig.3 a). Shorter drug application times (5 s) yielded similarly shaped current responses (Fig.3 b). These data indicate that, as is true of the wild-type receptor, the L250T mutant version of the α7 nAChR binds and is activated by Aβ42. Given the marked difference in the shape of the nicotine-induced currents versus the Aβ42-induced currents, the data also suggest that Aβ is more effective at eliciting desensitization of the L250T mutant receptors than is nicotine. Unlike wild-type α7 nAChRs, we were able to generate repeated responses to 10 pm Aβ42 from the L250T mutant receptor following a 10-min wash between Aβ applications (Fig. 3 b). It was not the case, however, that Aβ was unable to desensitize the receptor. Repetitive application of 10 pm Aβ42 (a 5-s Aβ perfusion every 1 min) induced current responses of decreasing magnitude until current responses were diminished to less than 5% of the initial current (data not shown). Under these conditions, short wash times (1 min) after Aβ42 perfusion led to nicotine responses indistinguishable from the initial nicotine test response. Thus, analogous to wild-type α7 nAChRs, a low concentration of Aβ42 (10 pm) has a desensitizing effect on L250T nAChRs that does not interfere with nicotine responses. We tested a range of Aβ42 concentrations on both wild-type and L250T α7 nAChRs expressed in Xenopus oocytes. Fig. 4shows concentration response results for concentrations of Aβ42 ranging from 100 fm to 100 nm (also shown in Table I). Noteworthy is the effect of high concentrations of Aβ42 on receptor responses. Aβ42 at nm concentrations is inhibitory to both the wild-type (Fig.4 a) and the L250 mutant (Fig. 4 b) α7 nAChR expressed in Xenopus oocytes. In fact, the 100 nm effect on wild-type α7 nAChRs is not statistically significant from zero current amplitude (p = 0.08, one-tailed Student's t test). Consistent with high concentrations of Aβ42 inducing receptor desensitization, the concentration response relationship forms an inverted “U” shape for both wild-type and L250T α7 nAChRs. In fact, as the Aβ42 concentration increases, the number of oocytes that fail to respond to Aβ42 increases although they proved positive for α7 nAChR expression (Fig. 4 c). In other words, with increasing Aβ42 concentration, a larger proportion of oocytes responsive to nicotine fail to respond to Aβ42 perfusion.Table IAverage peak current amplitudes resulting from different Aβ42 concentrations applied to wild-type or L250T mutant α7 nAChRs expressed in oocytesAβ42 concentrationCurrent amplitudeWTL250T nm nA nA 0.0001 16.95 n = 1 0.001 29.24 51.884.9520.67 n = 10 n = 3 0.01 55.94 1606.0921.47279.71 n = 19 n = 28 0.1 52.91 3801.0026.90957.36 n = 13 n = 7 1.00 14.836.36 n = 18 100 5.90 24.873.434.52 n = 4 n = 6Holding potential, −60 mV.

We also evaluated various concentrations of human Aβ40 for its ability to activate the L250T α7 nAChR. As was observed for wild-type α7 nAChRs, Aβ40 activated L250T receptors to a much lesser extent than an equivalent concentration of Aβ42. TableII lists peak current amplitudes for 10 pm, 1 nm, and 100 nm Aβ40 application to L250T α7 nAChRs expressed in oocytes. Crude analysis indicates that Aβ40 is less efficacious than Aβ42 at receptor activation.Table IIAverage peak current amplitudes resulting from different Aβ40 concentrations applied to wild-type or L250T mutant α7 nAChRs expressed in oocytesAβ40 concentrationCurrent amplitude nm nA 0.01 255.13109.59 n = 7 1.00 194.71116.38 n= 3 100 41.5514.23 n = 7Holding potential, −60 mV.

Xenopus oocytes endogenously express a Ca2+-activated chloride channel that produces a net inward current when activated. α7 nAChRs are highly permeable to Ca2+ (17Seguela P. Wadiche J. Dineley-Miller K. Dani J.A. Patrick J.W. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 596-604Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) such that when expressed in Xenopusoocytes, receptor activation leads to activation of the endogenous Ca2+-activated chloride channel. Replacement of Ca2+ ions with Ba2+ ions in the Ringer's solution greatly reduces α7-nAChR generated currents because the outward chloride current no longer contributes to the whole cell current. We tested the possibility that Aβ42 activation of α7 nAChRs leads to Ca2+ influx by performing recordings of the L250T mutant α7 nAChR following agonist applications in the presence and absence of Ca2+ in the perfusion buffer. Fig. 4 d illustrates that, in the presence of Ca2+, L250T α7 nAChRs exhibit large inward currents in response to both nicotine and Aβ42. In the absence of Ca2+, L250T α7 nAChRs have reduced nicotine and Aβ42 responses, yet the current amplitudes are still rather large. In Ca2+-free Ringer's solution, the nicotine and Aβ42 responses were 44.65 ± 8.30% and 43.62 ± 9.06%, respectively, of those in Ca2+ Ringer's solution (n = 7). These results suggest that: 1) currents induced by either nicotine or Aβ42 are significantly contributed to by the Ca2+-activated chloride channel; 2) Ca2+influx occurs with both nicotine and Aβ42 activation of α7 nAChRs; and 3) in the absence of Ca2+, ion flux still occurs through these receptors. We have demonstrated that rat Aβ42 peptide prepared in non-aggregate form directly activates rat α7 nAChRs expressed byXenopus oocytes. This is a high affinity interaction; concentrations as low as 100 fm Aβ42 are capable of inducing inward currents. Aβ42 is competitively antagonized by MLA and cross-desensitized by 4-OH-GTS-21, both α7 nAChR-selective agents. On wild-type receptors, the range of effective Aβ42 doses extends over the amount of soluble Aβ that occurs in normal (pm) as well as in AD (pm-nm) brain (1Kuo Y.M. Emmerling M.R. Vigo-Pelfrey C. Kasunic T.C. Kirkpatrick J.B. Murdoch G.H. Ball M.J. Roher A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4077-4081Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). This suggests the possibility of an Aβ-α7 nAChR interaction under normal physiologic conditions, and thus we propose that Aβ may be an endogenous ligand for α7 nAChRs. Furthermore, our data suggest that part of the pathology elicited by Aβ in AD may be due to aberrant activation of α7 nAChRs. In particular, as the α7 nAChR is a ligand-gated ion channel highly permeable to Ca2+ (17Seguela P. Wadiche J. Dineley-Miller K. Dani J.A. Patrick J.W. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 596-604Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), chronic activation of α7 nAChRs in AD could lead to dysregulation of Ca2+ homeostasis and provide a molecular mechanism for the cholinergic dysfunction that is a hallmark of AD (9Bowen D.M. Smith C.B. White P. Davison A.N. Brain. 1976; 99: 459-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (1028) Google Scholar, 10Davies P. Maloney A.J. Lancet. 1976; 2: 1403Abstract PubMed Scopus (2827) Google Scholar, 11Perry E.K. Perry R.H. Blessed G. Tomlinson B.E. Lancet. 1977; 1: 189Abstract PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar). The more prevalent form of amyloid peptide in brain, Aβ40, was also able to activate α7 nAChRs. However, Aβ40 was less effective than an equivalent concentration of Aβ42 at activating the wild-type and L250T mutant α7 nAChRs. It should be noted, however, that human and rat Aβ sequences differ by three amino acids; the efficacy of human Aβ40 might be diminished relative to rat Aβ40 on rat α7 nAChRs. Whether there is a marked difference in the efficacy of ratversus human Aβ peptides at α7 nAChRs is unknown at this time. Nonetheless, our data suggest that Aβ40, as well as Aβ42, is capable of activating a7 nAChRs in situ. One model we have proposed previously and that is consistent with our current findings is that hippocampus-dependent learning and memory impairments in early AD arise in part because of the increased Aβ burden and chronic activation of the ERK MAPK cascade in the hippocampus through α7 nAChRs (19Dineley K.T. Westerman M. Bui D. Bell K. Ashe K.H. Sweatt J.D. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 4125-4133Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In support of this, we have demonstrated that elevation of Aβ in vivo using an animal model for AD (Tg2576 (24Hsiao K. Chapman P. Nilsen S. Eckman C. Harigaya Y. Younkin S. Yang F. Cole G. Science. 1996; 274: 99-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (3700) Google Scholar)) leads to the up-regulation of hippocampal α7 nAChR protein (19Dineley K.T. Westerman M. Bui D. Bell K. Ashe K.H. Sweatt J.D. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 4125-4133Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). α7 nAChR up-regulation in the hippocampus of Tg2576 animals is coincident with the manifestation of a contextual fear learning deficit (34Dineley K.T. Xia X. Bui D. Sweatt J.D. Zheng H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22768-22780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), a hippocampus-dependent associative learning paradigm (25Kim J.J. Rison R.A. Fanselow M.S. Behav. Neurosci. 1993; 107: 1093-1098Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar, 26Phillips R.G. LeDoux J.E. Behav. Neurosci. 1992; 106: 274-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (2624) Google Scholar). Furthermore, increased α7 nAChR protein levels are detected concomitantly with dysregulation of the 42-kDa isoform of ERK MAPK (19Dineley K.T. Westerman M. Bui D. Bell K. Ashe K.H. Sweatt J.D. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 4125-4133Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Considering that ERK MAPK activity is necessary for rodent fear learning, α7 nAChR up-regulation in hippocampus may serve as a biochemical marker for the synaptic plasticity impairments and learning and memory deficits in Tg2576 animals that result from chronic elevated Aβ (27Atkins C.M. Selcher J.C. Petraitis J.J. Trzaskos J.M. Sweatt J.D. Nat. Neurosci. 1998; 1: 602-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (949) Google Scholar, 28Blum S. Moore A.N. Adams F. Dash P.K. J.

(Cold Spring Harb.). 1999; 6: 478-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Our observation of sustained inactivation of α7 nAChRs by low concentrations of Aβ42 may reflect prolonged occupancy of its binding site(s) on α7 nAChRs. This putative long-lasting interaction is consistent with the hypothesis proposed by Wang et al. (32Wang H.Y. Lee D.H. Davis C.B. Shank R.P. J.

On the other hand, if the conformation of Aβ in the receptor-bound state is incompatible with further aggregation, α7 nAChRs may decrease the amount of free Aβ, thus slowing Aβ aggregation until levels of Aβ rise beyond the binding capacity of α7 nAChRs. L250T mutant α7 nAChRs were utilized to confirm our observations of Aβ42 effects on wild-type receptors because these mutant α7 receptors generate much larger, longer lasting current responses (30Revah F. Bertrand D. Galzi J.L. Devillers-Thiery A. Mulle C. Hussy N. Bertrand S. Ballivet M. Changeux J.P. Nature. 1991; 353: 846-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar,31Bertrand D. Devillers-Thiery A. Revah F. Galzi J.L. Hussy N. Mulle C. Bertrand S. Ballivet M. Changeux J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1261-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). These studies again demonstrated a high affinity interaction of Aβ42 with the α7 nAChR. Consistent with its desensitization-resistant properties described previously (30Revah F. Bertrand D. Galzi J.L. Devillers-Thiery A. Mulle C. Hussy N. Bertrand S. Ballivet M. Changeux J.P. Nature. 1991; 353: 846-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar, 31Bertrand D. Devillers-Thiery A. Revah F. Galzi J.L. Hussy N. Mulle C. Bertrand S. Ballivet M. Changeux J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1261-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar), L250T receptors can be repeatedly activated by Aβ42 with washout between drug applications. However, in the absence of washout, Aβ42-induced receptor desensitization occurs. In a similar manner to the effects of low concentrations of Aβ on wild-type α7 nAChRs, nicotine responses from L250T receptors were virtually unaffected when these receptors were concurrently desensitized to Aβ42. A large proportion of the L250T whole cell current is due to secondary activation of the endogenous Ca2+-activated chloride current in Xenopus oocytes. Hence, the effects of Aβ42 on L250T confirm our findings with the wild-type receptor and suggest that Aβ-induced receptor activation leads to Ca2+ influx. Along these lines, we have recently shown that Aβ42 activates the ERK MAPK cascade through α7 nAChRs in hippocampal slices (19Dineley K.T. Westerman M. Bui D. Bell K. Ashe K.H. Sweatt J.D. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 4125-4133Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This activation requires extracellular Ca2+ and does not require action potential propagation. Thus, it is conceivable that ERK MAPK activation in hippocampus results from Ca2+ influx directly through α7 nAChRs following Aβ-activation. One notable feature of the L250T α7 nAChR current response to nicotine versus Aβ42 is the current profile. Whereas nicotine and other agonists for this receptor induce little desensitization during drug perfusion (30Revah F. Bertrand D. Galzi J.L. Devillers-Thiery A. Mulle C. Hussy N. Bertrand S. Ballivet M. Changeux J.P. Nature. 1991; 353: 846-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar, 31Bertrand D. Devillers-Thiery A. Revah F. Galzi J.L. Hussy N. Mulle C. Bertrand S. Ballivet M. Changeux J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1261-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar), at all concentrations of Aβ42 tested, Aβ application leads to more rapid closure of L250T channels than 1 or 10 μm nicotine. This observation may reflect desensitization or open channel block. We favor the interpretation that Aβ42 induces desensitization rather than acting as an open channel blocker since during washout, we do not observe a rebound outward current as a result of channel de-block. Furthermore, the ability to fully and rapidly activate α7 nAChRs with nicotine following inactivation of the Aβ42 response is consistent with an unblocked channel. Thus, Aβ42 appears to induce L250T α7 nAChR channel closing in a different manner than previously tested agents. Aβ42 is highly desensitizing to wild-type receptors in that high concentration or repeated application of Aβ42 inactivates the Aβ response in wild-type receptors. However, inactivation of the Aβ response with low concentrations of Aβ42 (10 pm) does not interfere with subsequent nicotine responses. Consistent with our data, Liu et al. (16Liu Q. Kawai H. Berg D.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4734-4739Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar) did not observe significant inhibition of α7 nAChR responses to acetylcholine on cultured hippocampal neurons following preincubation with Aβ42 at concentrations below 1 nm. These observations imply that the high affinity (low pm) Aβ42 binding site and the nicotine binding site do not overlap or that the conformation induced by low concentrations of Aβ42 interferes with subsequent Aβ activation but not with nicotine binding or receptor activation. We were able to inhibit nicotine activation of α7 nAChRs expressed in oocytes by preincubation with 100 nm Aβ42. These findings are in agreement with published reports by Petit et al. (15Pettit D.L. Shao Z. Yakel J.L. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: RC120Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and Liu et al. (16Liu Q. Kawai H. Berg D.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4734-4739Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar) that preincubation with high concentrations of Aβ42 antagonized subsequent activation of neuronally expressed α7 nAChRs. These observations suggest that a second, lower affinity binding site exists for Aβ42 that overlaps with the “traditional” agonist binding site. Alternatively, extended exposure to high concentrations of Aβ42 may induce a conformational change in the receptor that is incompatible with subsequent activation with traditional agonists. The presence of a second, lower affinity site for Aβ42 binding is supported by studies performed by Wang et al. (32Wang H.Y. Lee D.H. Davis C.B. Shank R.P. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 1155-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar) in which twoK i values were detected with [3H]MLA competition binding. K i values for Aβ42 binding to rat α7 nAChRs prepared from cortex and hippocampus were 4.1 and 440 pm, respectively. Furthermore, these binding constants are compatible with our observation that 1 pmAβ42 activates α7 nAChRs. The work presented here suggests that Aβ/α7 nAChR interactions may play a role in the etiology of AD. We have demonstrated that Aβ peptide functions as a ligand for α7 nAChRs, and we provide evidence that the binding and activation properties of Aβ42 are somewhat distinct from those of agonists such as nicotine. Specifically, low concentrations of Aβ42 activate the receptor and desensitize it to further activation by the peptide but not by nicotine; higher concentrations inhibit receptor activation and cross-desensitize it to nicotine. The unusual nature of Aβ42-induced receptor activation and desensitization indicates that the in situeffects on α7 nAChRs could prove to be quite complex. In general, however, our data indicate that compounds targeted to blocking the effects of Aβ on α7 nAChR function may be a promising therapy for AD.

Promastigotes of Leishmania donovani, the causative agent of Kala-azar, undergo an apoptosis-like death upon exposure to H2O2. The present study shows that upon activation of death response by H2O2, a dose- and time-dependent loss of mitochondrial membrane potential occurs. This loss is accompanied by a depletion of cellular glutathione, but cardiolipin content or thiol oxidation status remains unchanged. ATP levels are reduced within the first 60 min of exposure as a result of mitochondrial membrane potential loss. A tight link exists between changes in cytosolic Ca2+ homeostasis and collapse of the mitochondrial membrane potential, but the dissipation of the potential is independent of elevation of cytosolic Na+ and mitochondrial Ca2+. Partial inhibition of cytosolic Ca2+ increase achieved by chelating extracellular or intracellular Ca2+ by the use of appropriate agents resulted in significant rescue of the fall of the mitochondrial membrane potential and apoptosis-like death. It is further demonstrated that the increase in cytosolic Ca2+ is an additive result of release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores as well as by influx of extracellular Ca2+ through flufenamic acid-sensitive non-selective cation channels; contribution of the latter was larger. Mitochondrial changes do not involve opening of the mitochondrial transition pore as cyclosporin A is unable to prevent mitochondrial membrane potential loss. An antioxidant likeN-acetylcysteine is able to inhibit the fall of the mitochondrial membrane potential and prevent apoptosis-like death.

Reed J.C. Science. 1998; 258: 1309-1312Crossref Google Scholar). Maintenance of proper mitochondrial transmembrane potential (Δψ m )1 is essential for the survival of the cell as it drives the synthesis of ATP and maintains oxidative phosphorylation (2Gottlieb R.A. Biol. Signals Recept. 2001; 10: 147-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Recently, the study of mitochondrial potential has become a focus of apoptosis regulation as many investigations demonstrate a major functional impact of mitochondrial alterations on apoptosis (2Gottlieb R.A. Biol. Signals Recept. 2001; 10: 147-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Apoptosis is a process of cell death in which the cells undergo nuclear and cytoplasmic shrinkage; the chromatin is condensed and partitioned into multiple fragments, and finally the cells are broken into multiple membrane-bound bodies. In a number of experimental systems, disruption of Δψ m constitutes a constant early event of the apoptotic process that precedes nuclear disintegration (3Cossarizza A. Kalashnikova G. Grassilli E.

Res. 1997; 50: 413-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), a loss of Δψ m occur as an early change associated with apoptosis. Lymphocytes with low Δψ m show irreversible commitment to apoptosis in comparison to cells with high Δψ m that do not enter the apoptotic pathway (5Zamzami N. Marchetti P. Castedo M. Zanin C. Vayssiere J.L. Petit P.X. Kroemer G. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 1661-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (1089) Google Scholar). Δψ m loss can be brought about by reactive oxygen species (ROS) added directly in vitro or generated by agents that affect cellular metabolism (6Li X., Du, L. Darzynkiewicz Z. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 257: 290-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 7Dvorakova K. Waltmire C.N. Payne C.M. Tome M.E. Briehl M.M. Dorr R.T.

Res. 1997; 50: 413-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). A model ROS, H2O2 itself or in combination with Na+ or rotenone can cause a loss of Δψ m in several cell types (9Ehlers R.A. Hernandez A. Bloemendal L.S. Ethridge R.T. Farrow B. Evers B.M. Surgery. 1999; 2: 148-155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 10Chinopoulos C. Tretter L. Rozsa A. Adam-Vizi V.

Dissipation of Δψ m primarily occurs because of the permeabilization of the inner mitochondrial membrane resulting in the release of several apoptotic factors (2Gottlieb R.A. Biol. Signals Recept. 2001; 10: 147-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Because Δψ m is the driving force for mitochondrial ATP synthesis, loss of the Δψ m results in ATP depletion; however, in case of the energy-requiring process of apoptosis as opposed to necrosis, a minimum ATP generation continues (12Lemasters J.J. Qian T. Bradham C.A. Brenner D.A. Cascio W.E. Trost L.C. Nishimura Y. Nieminen A.L. Herman B. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1999; 31: 305-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Two major alterations in intermediate metabolism have been implicated in the loss of Δψ m and apoptosis. On the one hand, concentration of reduced GSH that largely determines cellular redox state is depleted early during the apoptotic process (13Anderson C.P. Tsai J.M. Meek W.E. Liu R.M. Tang Y. Forman H.J. Reynolds C.P. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 246: 183-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), and on the other hand, elevation of the cytosolic free Ca2+([Ca2+] c ) level is suggested to participate in the activation of nucleases that are involved in nuclear apoptosis (14Tagliarino C. Pink J.J. Dubyak G.R. Nieminen A.L. Boothman D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19150-19159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The role of elevated [Ca2+] c in bringing about early apoptotic changes including Δψ m loss in a cell is evident from studies showing the ability of intracellular Ca2+ chelators to block apoptosis (15Kruman I.I. Mattson M.P. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 529-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar) and the proapoptotic changes that can be induced by Ca2+-mobilizing agents like Ca2+ ionophores or thapsigargin, responsible for release of Ca2+ from the endoplasmic reticulum (16Koya R.C. Fujita H. Shimizu S. Ohtsu M. Takimoto M. Tsujimoto Y. Kuzumaki N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15343-15349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). In some cell systems, it is not only the [Ca2+] c increase but mitochondrial Ca2+ ([Ca2+] m ) overload (17Ward M.W. Rego A.C. Frenguelli B.G. Nicholls D.G. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 7208-7219Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as well that precipitates a decrease in Δψ m . Among other cations in addition to Ca2+, changes in Na+ and K+homeostasis are known to lead to the loss of Δψ m (18Kim J.A. Kang Y.Y. Lee Y.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 281: 511-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Together, the existing literature suggests that, depending on the cell system under investigation, alterations of Ca2+ levels in cell cytoplasm and mitochondria brought about by ROS or other agents can serve as critical signaling components leading to the activation of the apoptotic pathway. The importance of an optimum Δψ m in cell survival has been recognized not only in mammals but in yeast (19Kowaltowski A.J. Vercesi A.E. Rhee S.G. Netto L.E. FEBS Lett. 2000; 473: 177-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and protozoal parasites as well (20Vercesi A.E. Docampo R. Biochem. J. 1992; 284: 463-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The species of Leishmania donovani, a protozoal parasite, is the etiologic agent of Kala-azar, a chronic and often fatal form of human visceral Leishmaniasis (21Chang K.P. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1983; 14 (suppl.): 267-305Google Scholar). This parasite has a digenic life cycle residing as flagellated extracellular promastigotes in the gut of the insect vector. Upon transmission to the mammalian host as bloodstream-infective promastigotes, they are engulfed by the macrophages where they reside intracellularly as non-flagellated amastigotes (21Chang K.P. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1983; 14 (suppl.): 267-305Google Scholar). At the time of engulfment of the promastigotes by the macrophages, ROS is generated by the host cell in an attempt to kill the parasites (22Nabi Z.F. Rabinovitch M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1984; 10: 297-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). ROS is also generated by anti-leishmanial drugs targeting Δψ m of amastigotes to kill them (23Rais S. Perianin A. Lenoir M. Sadak A. Rivollet D. Paul M. Deniau M. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2000; 44: 2406-2410Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Existing studies suggest that drug resistance in protozoal parasites may be related to changes in Δψ m (24Basselin M. Robert-Gero M. Parasitol. Res. 1998; 84: 78-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Even though the importance of ROS and Δψ m is very obvious from these studies, it is not clear how ROS affects the death process in the kinetoplastid parasites. Recent studies (25Das M. Mukherjee S.B. Shaha C. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2461-2469Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) from this laboratory demonstrate thatL. donovani promastigotes undergo an apoptosis-like death in response to a well established model of a biologically active oxygen-derived intermediate, H2O2. The H2O2-induced death shares many features common to metazoan apoptosis such as nuclear condensation, DNA fragmentation, and cell shrinkage (25Das M. Mukherjee S.B. Shaha C. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2461-2469Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The present study was designed to address the functional relationship among free radical levels, Δψ m disruption, GSH concentrations, and alterations in cytosolic Ca2+ and Na+ and mitochondrial Ca2+ in L. donovani induced by H2O2 that lead to apoptosis-like death. It is demonstrated that when death response is activated in L. donovani promastigotes by oxidative stress, a loss of Δψ m occurs. The above findings suggest that elevation of [Ca2+] c due to influx of Ca2+ through non-selective cation channels and release from intracellular stores is tightly linked to the dissipation of Δψ m that is independent of increase in cytosolic Na+, [Ca2+] m , and GSH depletion that accompanies the change in [Ca2+] c . A reduction in ATP generation occurs, but a minimal ATP level is maintained to help the cell enter the apoptosis-like pathway. 5,5′,6,6′-Tetrachloro-1,1′,3,3′-tetraethylbenzimidazole carbocyanide iodide (JC-1), BAPTA-AM, fluo-3-acetoxymethyl ester (fluo-3/AM), rhod-2/acetoxymethyl ester (rhod-2/AM), 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (H2DCFDA), sulfinpyrazone, pluronic acid F-127, MitoTracker® Green FM, SYTOX® Blue nucleic acid stain, nonyl acridine orange (NAO), potassium-binding benzofuran isophthalate acetoxymethyl ester (PBFI-AM), sodium-binding benzofuran isophthalate acetoxymethyl ester (SBFI-AM), and ATP determination kit were obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase enzyme (TdT)-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) kit was from Promega (Madison, WI). Cyclosporin A, atractyloside, butathione sulfoximine (BSO), reduced GSH, N-acetylcysteine (NAC), digitonin,o-phthalaldehyde, ruthenium red, medium 199, and any other chemicals unless otherwise mentioned were obtained from Sigma. Promastigotes of L. donovani (UR 6) were obtained from the Cell Biology Laboratory, National Institute of Immunology, New Delhi, India. The promastigotes were cultured in blood agar as described previously (25Das M. Mukherjee S.B. Shaha C. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2461-2469Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, routine cultures were maintained on solid blood agar slants containing 1% glucose, 5.2% brain heart infusion agar extract, and rabbit blood (6% v/v) with gentamycin at a final concentration of 1–1.5 mg/ml of medium at 25 °C. For experimental purposes, cells were recovered from 3-day-old blood agar culture in medium 199 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, centrifuged, resuspended in medium, and loaded onto Percoll gradient (20–90%) to remove dead cells. Live cells were collected at the interface between 40 and 90% Percoll. These cells comprising 100% motile promastigotes were washed in medium 199 and resuspended in fresh medium to achieve a culture density of 107 cells/ml. All Δψ m measurements were carried out with a potentiometric probe JC-1. Changes in Δψ m after H2O2 exposure were measured by exposing the cells to 0.1, 1, and 4 mm H2O2 and harvesting the cells at 0, 15, and 60 min and 2, 4, and 8 h for JC-1 staining. A mitochondrial uncoupler, valinomycin (100 nm), was used as a positive control for Δψ m loss. For incubations with NAC, cells were pretreated with 20 mm NAC for 3 h prior to exposure to 4 mmH2O2. Depletion of GSH was achieved by treating the cells with 1 mm BSO for 3 h. For catalase preincubations, cells were exposed to 50 I.U. catalase for 1 h prior to H2O2 exposure. To test if oxidation of cellular thiols was responsible for Δψ m loss, the cells were preincubated with different concentrations of dithiothreitol (DTT) (0.25–8 mm) prior to exposure to H2O2. For intracellular Ca2+measurements under different treatment conditions, cells were pretreated with 1.5 μm thapsigargin or 25 μm BAPTA-AM or 3 mm EGTA or 10 μm Ca2+ ionophore A23187 prior to exposure to H2O2. To determine the route of entry of Ca2+ through plasma membrane channels after H2O2 exposure, bepridil (10–500 μm), verapamil (10 μm), and flufenamic acid (30–240 μm) were used to treat the cells prior to exposure to oxidative stress. Ruthenium red, an inhibitor of mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter, was used (25, 50 and 100 μm) to preincubate cells prior to H2O2 stress to determine the role of mitochondrial Ca2+ in Δψ m loss. To investigate if induction of mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP) occurred in response to H2O2 exposure, cyclosporin A (5–10 μm), an inhibitor of MPTP, was used to preincubate cells for 1 h prior to exposure to 4 mmH2O2. To determine whether atractyloside could induce MPTP in these cells, cells were treated with atractyloside (5 nm to 5 mm) for different times (1–16 h) following which Δψ m was measured. All measurements of fluorescence were carried out with a LS-50B luminescence spectrometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using FL WinlabTM software package. For confocal microscopy, a Zeiss LSM 510 (Zeiss Inc, Thornwood, NY) confocal system fitted with an upright Axioplan 2 microscope was used. Δψ m was estimated using JC-1 as a probe according to the method of Dey and Moraes (26Dey R. Moraes C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7087-7094Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. JC-1 is a cationic mitochondrial vital dye that is lipophilic and becomes concentrated in the mitochondria in proportion to their Δψ m ; more dye accumulates in mitochondria with greater Δψ m and ATP-generating capacity. Therefore, the fluorescence of JC-1 can be considered as an indicator of relative mitochondrial energy state. The dye exists as a monomer at low concentrations (emission, 530 nm, green fluorescence) but at higher concentrations forms J-aggregates (emission, 590 nm, red fluorescence). JC-1 was chosen because of its reliability for analyzing Δψ m in intact cells, whereas other probes capable of binding mitochondria show a lower sensitivity or a non-coherent behavior due to a high sensitivity to changes in plasma membrane potential (27Bortner C.D. Cidlowski J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21953-21962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 28Eric C. Dietze L. Caldwell E. Grupin S.L. Mariangela M. Seewaldt V.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5384-5394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells after different treatments were collected and incubated for 7 min with 10 μm JC-1 at 37 °C, washed, resuspended in media, and measured for fluorescence. The ratio of the reading at 590 nm to the reading at 530 nm (590:530 ratio) was considered as the relative Δψ m value. To ensure the viability of cells, SYTOX® Blue (50 nm) nucleic acid stain was used because it did not interfere with the red and green staining obtained with JC-1, and these cells were checked under a Nikon Optiphot fluorescence microscope (Nikon Inc., Japan). For microscopy, JC-1-stained cells were placed on slides and immediately imaged with the confocal microscopy system using plan-neofluar objectives ×40 or 100 with numerical apertures of 0.75 and 1.3, respectively. Pinhole was set at 100 μm. Images were collected after illuminating the J-monomers and -aggregates simultaneously with a 488-nm argon ion laser, and fluorescence was collected with a 500–550 bandpass filter for monomer detection and a 560 long pass filter for aggregate detection. Laser was used at 13% power. Cells were chosen for analysis on a random basis and scanned only once because the laser light could itself induce changes altering cell fluorescence. Collected images were overlapped to visualize the distribution of monomers and aggregates. Mitochondrial mass was measured with NAO, a fluorescent dye that specifically binds to the mitochondrial inner membrane independent of the transmembrane potential and is reported to measure inner mitochondrial cardiolipin content (29Thomas R.L Matsko C.M. Lotze M.T. Amoscato A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30580-30588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Cells were stained with 0.1 μm NAO in medium 199 with 10% fetal calf serum, and fluorescence was measured with excitation at 485 nm and emission at 535 nm. Cellular GSH levels were measured in different treatment groups with the fluorescence probe o-phthalaldehyde (30Senft A.P. Dalton T.P. Shertzer H.G. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 280: 80-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Briefly, homogenized samples were mixed with trichloroacetic acid-redox quenching buffer (10% trichloroacetic acid in redox quenching buffer, 20 mm HCl, 5 mm diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid, 10 mm ascorbic acid), and KPi (1:01m in 1:4 ratio) was added followed by addition of 5.5 mmol of o-phthalaldehyde. This mixture was incubated for 5 min at room temperature. o-phthalaldehyde-derived fluorescence was measured at 365-nm excitation and 430 nm emission. ATP was measured by a bioluminescence assay (31Kricka L.J. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 175: 14-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) using an ATP determination kit. The assay is based on the requirement of luciferase for ATP in producing light (emission maximum ∼560 nm at pH 7.8). Briefly, cells (∼5 × 105) after different treatments were resuspended in reaction buffer containing 1 mm DTT, 0.5 mm luciferin, and 12.5 μg/ml luciferase and gently mixed, following which readings were taken in a luminometer (Lumicount, Packard Instrument Co.). ATP standard curves were run in all experiments with different concentrations of ATP, and calculations were made against the curve, and cellular ATP levels were expressed as nmol/106 cells. To monitor the level of ROS, the cell-permeant probe H2DCFDA was used (32Duranteau J. Chandel N.S. Kulisz A. Shao Z. Schumacker P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11619-11624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). H2DCFDA is a nonpolar compound that readily diffuses into cells, where it is hydrolyzed to the nonfluorescent derivative dichlorodihydrofluorescein and is thereby trapped within the cells. In the presence of a proper oxidant, dichlorodihydrofluorescein is oxidized to the highly fluorescent 2,7-dichlorofluorescein. Cells of different treatment groups were resuspended in 500 μl of medium 199 and labeled with H2DCFDA (2 μg/ml) for 15 min in the dark. Fluorimetric analyses was carried out at 507 nm excitation and 530 nm emission. For all measurements, the basal fluorescence was subtracted. Changes in intracellular Ca2+ concentration [Ca2+] i were monitored with the fluorescent probe fluo-3/AM as described by González et al. (33González A. Schulz I. Schmid A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38680-38686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. Cells (107/ml) were loaded for 60 min at 25 °C with 5 μm fluo-3/AM containing 1 μm pluronic acid F-127 for proper dispersal, and 0.25 mm sulfinpyrazone, an organic anion transport inhibitor, was used to inhibit the leakage of the fluo-3 dye. Just before use, a sample of loaded cells was washed with medium to remove nonhydrolyzed fluo-3/AM. Fluorescence measurements were performed at 25 °C with excitation at 488 nm and emission at 522 nm. To convert fluorescence values into absolute [Ca2+] i , calibration was performed at the end of each experiment. [Ca2+] i was calculated using the following equation: [Ca2+] i =K d ((F −F min)/(F max −F)), where K d is the dissociation constant of the Ca2+·Fluo 3 complex (400 nm), and F represents the fluorescence intensity of the cells.F max represents the maximum fluorescence (obtained by treating cells with 10 μmA23187), andF min corresponds to the minimum fluorescence (obtained for ionophore-treated cells in the presence of 3 mm EGTA). Fluorescence intensities were expressed as the increase in fluorescence with respect to base-line fluorescence intensity before stimulation. For separate measurement of mitochondrial Ca2+ signals, freshly isolated cells were loaded at 4 °C for 15 min with 8 μm rhod-2/AM, centrifuged for 2 min at 30 ×g, and resuspended in media for incubation at 25 °C for 30 min to allow hydrolysis of rhod-2/AM trapped in mitochondria (33González A. Schulz I. Schmid A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38680-38686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). After rhod-2 loading, cells were stored at 4 °C, and experiments were performed within 1 h. Rhod-2 fluorescence was measured with excitation at 568 nm and emission at 605 nm. To confirm that rhod-2 fluorescence signals originated from mitochondria only, promastigotes were double-loaded with 8 μm rhod-2/AM, and the fluorescent mitochondrial marker MitoTracker® Green FM (100 nm) for 30 min at room temperature (33González A. Schulz I. Schmid A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38680-38686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Images of MitoTracker® Green FM fluorescence and red rhod-2 fluorescence were collected using 488 and 568 nm laser lines and detected with a 505–530 bandpass filter and a 590 nm long pass filter, respectively. Changes in intracellular K+ and Na+ ion levels of the promastigotes were monitored by loading the cells with either the potassium or sodium-sensitive fluorescent dyes PBFI-AM and SBFI-AM, respectively (34Bortner C.D. Hughes F.M. Cidlowski J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32436-32442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar), for 60 min to a final concentration of 5 μm. Stock solutions of both dyes (2.5 mm) were prepared fresh by combining equal volumes of a 25% (w/v) pluronic acid F-127 (Molecular Probes) and the dye working solution. Fluorescence for SBFI and PBFI was monitored at excitation of 340/380 nm and emission at 500 nm. In situcalibration of the SBFI fluorescence was performed according to the method described by Zhang and Melvin (35Zhang G.H. Melvin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29067-29072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) using monensin (5 μm). [Na+] i was calculated according to Zhang and Melvin (35Zhang G.H. Melvin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29067-29072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) using 18 mm as theK d of SBFI for Na+ ion. Cells were exposed to DNA binding dye Hoechst 33342 (10 μg/ml), and apoptotic cells were monitored under a fluorescence microscope as described previously (25Das M. Mukherjee S.B. Shaha C. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2461-2469Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). TUNEL staining was performed using the in situ cell death detection kit following the standard protocol provided by the manufacturer (Promega, WI) and as modified earlier (25Das M. Mukherjee S.B. Shaha C. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2461-2469Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, H2O2-treated promastigotes under different treatments were harvested at 6 h, fixed in 4% formaldehyde, and coated onto poly(l-lysine)-covered slides. Permeabilization was done with 0.2% (v/v) Triton X-100 and equilibration buffer (200 mm potassium cacodylate, 25 mm Tris-HCl, 0.2 mm DTT, 0.25 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 2.5 mmcobalt chloride) for 10 min at room temperature followed by incubation with TdT buffer containing nucleotide mix (50 μmfluorescein-12-dUTP, 100 μm dATP, 10 mmTris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.6) for 1 h at 37 °C. The samples were counter stained with 10 μg/ml propidium iodide and visualized under the confocal microscope using illumination from a 488 nm argon-ion laser, and images were recorded through a bandpass filter 500–550 and a long pass filter at 590 nm. Data are reported as mean ± S.E. unless mentioned. Comparisons were made between different treatments using the unpaired Student's t test. Differences were considered significant at p < 0.05.

https://openalex.org/W2109455334,"Human mast cells and basophils that express the high-affinity immunoglobulin E (IgE) receptor, Fc epsilon receptor 1 (Fc epsilon RI), have key roles in allergic diseases. Fc epsilon RI cross-linking stimulates the release of allergic mediators. Mast cells and basophils co-express Fc gamma RIIb, a low affinity receptor containing an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif and whose co-aggregation with Fc epsilon RI can block Fc epsilon RI-mediated reactivity. Here we designed, expressed and tested the human basophil and mast-cell inhibitory function of a novel chimeric fusion protein, whose structure is gamma Hinge-CH gamma 2-CH gamma 3-15aa linker-CH epsilon 2-CH epsilon 3-CH epsilon 4. This Fc gamma Fc epsilon fusion protein was expressed as the predicted 140-kappa D dimer that reacted with anti-human epsilon- and gamma-chain specific antibodies. Fc gamma Fc epsilon bound to both human Fc epsilon RI and Fc gamma RII. It also showed dose- and time-dependent inhibition of antigen-driven IgE-mediated histamine release from fresh human basophils sensitized with IgE directed against NIP (4-hydroxy-3-iodo-5-nitrophenylacetyl). This was associated with altered Syk signaling. The fusion protein also showed increased inhibition of human anti-NP (4-hydroxy-3-nitrophenylacetyl) and anti-dansyl IgE-mediated passive cutaneous anaphylaxis in transgenic mice expressing human Fc epsilon RI alpha. Our results show that this chimeric protein is able to form complexes with both Fc epsilon RI and Fc gamma RII, and inhibit mast-cell and basophil function. This approach, using a Fc gamma Fc epsilon fusion protein to co-aggregate Fc epsilon RI with a receptor containing an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motif, has therapeutic potential in IgE- and Fc epsilon RI-mediated diseases."

The mechanism by which TLR2 recognizes PGN is unknown. It is not even clear whether TLR2 directly binds to PGN. In this study, we generated a soluble form of recombinant TLR2 (sTLR2) possessing only its putative extracellular domain by using the baculovirus expression system to examine the direct interaction between sTLR2 and PGN. sTLR2 bound avidly to insoluble PGN (iPGN) from Staphylococcus aureus coated onto microtiter wells in a concentration-dependent manner. In contrast, sTLR2 exhibited a very weak binding to lipopolysaccharide. iPGN cosedimented sTLR2 after the mixture of iPGN and sTLR2 had been incubated and centrifuged. sTLR2 partially attenuated the iPGN-induced NF-κB activation in TLR2-transfected HEK 293 cells and the iPGN-induced IL-8 secretion in U937 cells. One of anti-human TLR2 monoclonal antibodies, which blocked iPGN-induced NF-κB activation in TLR2-transfected cells, inhibited the binding of sTLR2 to iPGN.

TLR2 (−/−) mice were highly susceptible to Staphylococcus aureus infection (23Takeuchi O. Hoshino K. Akira S. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 5392-5396Crossref PubMed Scopus (911) Google Scholar). Macrophages from TLR2-deficient mice responded to LPS but were unable to produce proinflammatory cytokines in response to PGN (21Takeuchi O. Hoshino K. Kawai T. Sanjo H. Takada H. Ogawa T. Takeda K.

In addition, TLR5 and TLR9 have recently been shown to be involved in recognition of bacterial flagellin and DNA, respectively (24Hayashi F. Smith K., D. Ozinsky A. Hawn T.R., Yi, E.C. Goodlett D.R.

It is well recognized that TLRs are critical for cell signaling induced by broad ranges of microbes and their components. TLRs are thought to recognize specific molecular patterns of microbial components. One recent study (26da Silva Correia J. Soldau K. Christen U. Tobias P.S. Ulevitch R.J. J. Biol.

PGN induces the activation of NF-κB in HEK 293 cells expressing TLR2 in the absence of CD14, although coexpression of CD14 enhances TLR2-mediated signaling (17Schwandner R. Dziarski R. Wesche H. Rothe M. Kirschning C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17406-17409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1438) Google Scholar). This suggests that TLR2 can interact with PGN regardless of whether CD14 is expressed. The specific objective of this study was to determine whether TLR2 directly binds PGN. In this study we generated a soluble form of recombinant TLR2 (sTLR2) lacking the putative intracellular and transmembrane domains and conducted a binding study using sTLR2 and insoluble PGN (iPGN) derived fromS. aureus. This study clearly demonstrated that the extracellular TLR2 domain binds iPGN. iPGN derived from S. aureus was obtained from Fluka Chemical. LPS from Escherichia coliO26:B6 and from Salmonella minnesota Re595 were purchased from Sigma. Recombinant sCD14 expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells was prepared as described previously (27Sano H. Chiba H. Iwaki D. Sohma H. Voelker D.R. Kuroki Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22442-22451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Anti-human TLR2 monoclonal antibody (mAb 2392) was a kind gift from Genentech (San Francisco, CA). Anti-human TLR2 monoclonal antibody (mAb TL2.3) was obtained from Alexis Biochemicals (San Diego, CA). A 2.6-kb cDNA for human TLR2 was obtained by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction using RNA isolated from U937 cells. sTLR2 consists of the putative extracellular domain (Met1–Arg587) and a His6 tag at the C-terminal end and sTLR2 cDNA was constructed by using PCR. The sense and antisense primers used were 5′-GGATCCAAAGGAGACCTATAG-3′ and 5′-TTAGTGATGGTGATGGTGATGCCTGTGACATTCCGACAC-3′, respectively. The sTLR2 cDNA was subcloned into pVL1393 plasmid vector usingBamHI and NotI sites. The recombinant plasmid constructed was confirmed by a combination of restriction enzyme mapping and DNA sequencing. The sTLR2 protein was expressed in the baculovirus insect cell expression system using the methods described by O'Reilly et al. (28O'Reilly D.R. Miller L.K. Luckow V.A. Baculovirus Expression Vector: A Laboratory Manual. W. H. Freeman and Company, New York1992: 139-179Google Scholar). Monolayers of Spodopera frugiperda (Sf-9) cells were cotransfected with linearized virus DNA (BaculoGold, Pharmingen) and the pVL1393 plasmid vector containing cDNA for sTLR2. Viral titers were amplified to ∼5–10 × 107 plaque-forming units/ml. The recombinant viruses were used to infect monolayers of Tni cells in serum-free medium at a multiplicity of 2. After a 3-day incubation, the sTLR2 protein was purified from the medium using a column of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid beads (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) by the method described previously (27Sano H.

The protein concentrations were determined using a bicinchoninic assay (BCA; Pierce). The proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (12.5% gel) under reducing conditions according to the method of Laemmli (29Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) and were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. Antisera against sTLR2 and sCD14 were raised in rabbits. sTLR2 (100 μg) or sCD14 (100 μg) was emulsified in TiterMax® Gold (CytRx Corp.) and given intradermally. After 3 weeks, a booster with 80 μg of sTLR2 or sCD14 in the same adjuvant was injected. The blood samples were collected 2 weeks later, and IgG was isolated from the sera using a protein G-Sepharose 4FF column (Amersham Biosciences). The binding of sTLR2 and sCD14 to iPGN and LPS was performed by the method described previously for the binding of sCD14 to LPS (27Sano H. Chiba H. Iwaki D. Sohma H. Voelker D.R. Kuroki Y. J. Biol.

The indicated amount of iPGN or LPS in 20 μl of ethanol was added onto microtiter wells (Immulon 1B, Dynex), and the solvent was evaporated in ambient air. Nonspecific binding was blocked with 10 mm HEPES buffer (pH 7.4) containing 0.15m NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, and 5% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (buffer A). The indicated concentrations of sTLR2 or sCD14 (50 μl/well) in the buffer A were then added and incubated at 37 °C for 6 h. After the incubation, the wells were washed with PBS containing 3% (w/v) skim milk and 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 and were then incubated for 1 h with 30 μg/ml anti-sTLR2 IgG or anti-sCD14 IgG in the same buffer, followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:1000) for 1 h. The peroxidase reaction was finally performed usingo-phenylenediamine as a substrate after washing the wells with PBS containing 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100. The binding of the protein to iPGN or LPS was detected by measuring absorbance at 492 nm. Glass tubes that had been coated with silicone (SIL-COAT5, IWAKI, Japan) were used in the experiments. The preparation of 3 μg of sTLR2 or sCD14 in 100 μl of the buffer A was first centrifuged at 2,000 × g for 5 min. The supernatant was collected and mixed with 30 μg of iPGN in a fresh silicone-coated tube. The mixture of protein and iPGN was incubated at 37 °C for 3 h with gentle shaking. After the incubation, the mixture was centrifuged at 2,000 × g for 5 min, and the supernatant was removed. The pellet was suspended with 300 μl of PBS containing 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 and centrifuged again at 2,000 × g for 5 min, and the supernatant was removed. The washing step was repeated three times. The pellet obtained by the final centrifugation was suspended in 30 μl of the sampling buffer for SDS-PAGE and boiled for 5 min. sTLR2 or sCD14 that had cosedimented with iPGN was detected by immunoblotting analysis. The sample was electrophoresed and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Nonspecific binding was blocked by incubating the membrane with 20 mm Tris buffer (pH 7.4) containing 0.15 m NaCl, 3% (w/v) skim milk, and 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20 (buffer B) for 30 min. The membranes were then incubated with anti-sTLR2 or anti-sCD14 IgG (10 μg/ml) in the buffer B for 3 h at room temperature. After washing the membranes with the buffer B, they were further incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG. The proteins that cosedimented with iPGN were finally visualized using SuperSignal® West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. A 2.6-kb TLR2 cDNA was subcloned into pcDNA3.1(+) (Invitrogen). Activation of NF-κB was measured as described previously (14Kirschning C.J. Wesche H. Ayres T.M. Rothe M. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 2091-2097Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar, 17Schwandner R. Dziarski R. Wesche H. Rothe M. Kirschning C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17406-17409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1438) Google Scholar). HEK 293 cells were plated at 1 or 1.5 × 105 cells/well in 24-well plates on the day before transfection. The cells were transiently transfected by FuGENETM 6 transfection reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) with 30 or 100 ng of an NF-κB reporter construct (pNF-κB-Luc; Stratagene) and 3.5 or 10 ng of a construct that directed expression of Renilla luciferase under the control of the constitutively active thymidine kinase promoter (pRL-TK; Promega), together with 150 or 200 ng of transfectant gene. Forty-eight hours after transfection, the cells were stimulated with 0.1, 1.0, or 10 μg/ml iPGN in serum-free medium for 6 h, and luciferase activity was measured by using the dual luciferase reporter assay system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. In some experiments the transfected cells were preincubated with monoclonal antibody or control mouse IgG at 37 °C for 30 min. To examine the effect of sTLR2 on iPGN-induced NF-κB activation, iPGN was preincubated with sTLR2 (0–10 μg/ml) for 30 min before incubation with the cells. sTLR2 was iodinated by the method of Bolton and Hunter (31Bolton A.E. Hunter W.M. Biochem. J. 1973; 133: 529-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (2403) Google Scholar) using Bolton-Hunter reagent (Amersham Biosciences). The specific radioactivity ranged from 278 to 293 cpm/ng, and more than 85% of the radioactivity was precipitated by treatment with 10% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid. The binding study with 125I-sTLR2 was performed by sedimentation assay. The indicated concentrations of125I-sTLR2 were incubated with 1 μg of iPGN (100 μl/tube) in the buffer A at 37 °C for 3 h. After the incubation, the reaction mixture was transferred into the polypropylene tube and was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 5 min. The supernatant was removed, and the resultant pellet was washed three times with 500 μl of PBS containing 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100. The final pellet was resuspended with PBS containing 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100, and the suspension was transferred into a new tube. The radioactivity of 125I-sTLR2 bound to the iPGN pellet was measured using a γ-radiation counter. Specific binding was determined by subtracting the binding obtained in the absence of iPGN from that in the presence of iPGN. Fifty microliters of sTLR2 (10 μg/ml) or bovine serum albumin (10 μg/ml) was added onto microtiter wells and incubated at 4 °C overnight. After blocking the wells with the buffer A, the indicated concentrations of sCD14 (50 μl/well) in the buffer A were added and incubated at 37 °C for 3 h. After the incubation, the wells were washed with PBS containing 3% (w/v) skim milk and 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100, and the binding of sCD14 was detected using anti-sCD14 IgG. U937 cells (5 × 105 cells) were differentiated by incubation with 10 nm phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum for 24 h. The cells were further incubated in the absence of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum for 24 h. The cells were stimulated in serum-free RPMI medium for 6 h with 1 μg/ml iPGN that had been preincubated for 30 min with sTLR2 (0–1 μg/ml). After the incubation, concentrations of IL-8 secreted from U937 cells were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using an OptEIATM Human IL-8 Set (Pharmingen, San Diego, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Approximately 190 μg of sTLR2 was obtained from 450 ml of culture medium. The N-terminal sequence of sTLR2 determined by an Applied Biosystems Procise 492 sequencer was ESSNQASLSXDRNGIXKGSS. This result was coincident with the deduced amino acid sequence of TLR2 starting at Glu21. Electrophoretic analysis revealed that sTLR2 exhibited a single band with a molecular mass of ∼75 kDa (Fig.1 A). sCD14 migrated as broad bands with 46–56 kDa, as described previously (27Sano H. Chiba H. Iwaki D. Sohma H. Voelker D.R. Kuroki Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22442-22451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 32Stelter F. Pfister M. Bernheiden M. Jack R.S. Bufler P. Engelmann H. Schütt C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 236: 457-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). sCD14 has been shown to bind soluble PGN as well as LPS (33Dziarski R. Tapping R.I. Tobias P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8680-8690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). We investigated the binding of sTLR2 and sCD14 to iPGN coated onto microtiter wells. When 0–5 μg/ml of sTLR2 and sCD14 were incubated with solid phase iPGN (20 μg/well), both proteins bound to iPGN in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 2 A). Concentration-dependent binding of sTLR2 to iPGN increased with the increasing amounts of iPGN (Fig. 2 B). The binding of sTLR2 to O26:B6 LPS or Re LPS was also examined compared with iPGN binding (Fig. 2 C). sTLR2 avidly bound to 20 μg/well iPGN, but the binding of sTLR2 to 20 μg/well LPS was clearly weak. The amount of sTLR2 binding to O26:B6 or Re LPS was less than 13% of that to iPGN. Another binding study was also performed by sedimentation, because we used insoluble PGN. To examine whether iPGN was sedimentable by centrifugation at 2,000 × g for 5 min, we determined the abilities of the supernatant and the pellet obtained by the centrifugation to induce tumor necrosis factor-α secretion from U937 cells. Tumor necrosis factor-α secretion was measured using the L929 bioassay as described previously (30Sano H. Sohma H. Muta T. Nomura S. Voelker D.R. Kuroki Y. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 387-395PubMed Google Scholar). The pellet fraction contained 99.3% (mean of three experiments) of tumor necrosis factor-α-inducing activity, indicating that almost all of the iPGN was sedimentable by the centrifugation. After the mixture of sTLR2 or sCD14 and iPGN suspension was incubated and centrifuged, the proteins that had cosedimented with iPGN were analyzed by immunoblotting using anti-sTLR2 or anti-sCD14 IgG (Fig.1 B). iPGN cosedimented sTLR2 or sCD14. When sTLR2 or sCD14 was incubated without iPGN, none of them was sedimentable. When surfactant protein A, which does not bind to iPGN (34Murakami S. Iwaki D. Mitsuzawa H. Sano H. Takahashi H. Voelker D.R. Akino T. Kuroki Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6830-6837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), was used as a negative control, iPGN failed to cosediment this protein. The binding study with 125I-labeled sTLR2 was also performed by sedimentation assay (Fig.3). sTLR2 exhibited concentration-dependent and saturable binding. When the molecular mass of sTLR2 was estimated as 75 kDa (Fig. 1 A), the binding of sTLR2 to iPGN has an apparent K d of 67 × 10−9m. A maximum of ∼40 ng (0.53 pmol) of sTLR2 was assumed to bind to 1 μg of iPGN. Taken together, these data clearly demonstrate that sTLR2 directly binds to iPGN. We examined the effect of sTLR2 on iPGN-induced NF-κB activation in TLR2-transfected HEK 293 cells. Coincubation of iPGN (100 and 1000 ng/ml) and sTLR2 (0.1–10 μg/ml) attenuated the activities of NF-κB (Fig. 4 A). sTLR2 at 1 and 10 μg/ml reduced the NF-κB activity by ∼40–50%. We also examined the effect of sTLR2 on iPGN-induced IL-8 secretion in U937 cells. When differentiated U937 cells were stimulated with iPGN (1 μg/ml) that had been preincubated with sTLR2 (0–1 μg/ml), the IL-8 secretion was decreased in a manner dependent upon the sTLR2 concentrations (Fig. 4 B). sTLR2 at 1 μg/ml reduced the iPGN-induced IL-8 secretion by 36%. Anti-TLR2 monoclonal antibody (mAb 2392), whose epitope is localized at the extracellular TLR2 domain (35Aliprantis A., O. Yang R.-B. Mark M.R. Sugget S. Devaux B. Radolf J.D. Klimpel G.R. Godowski P. Zychlinski A. Science. 1999; 285: 736-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (1278) Google Scholar), has been shown to inhibit secretion of tumor necrosis factor-α and IL-8 elicited by PGN in macrophage cell line THP-CD14, a monocytic cell line that constitutively expresses CD14 (36Tapping R.I. Akashi S. Miyake K. Godowski P.J. Tobias P.S. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 5780-5787Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Another mAb TL2.3 also recognizes the extracellular TLR2 domain and has been shown to immunostain peripheral blood mononuclear cells (37Flo T.H. Halaas O. Torp S. Ryan L. Lien E. Dybdahl B. Sundan A. Espevik T. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2001; 69: 474-481PubMed Google Scholar). When iPGN was incubated with TLR2-transfected HEK 293 cells in the presence of mAb 2392, the antibody inhibited the iPGN-induced NF-κB activity in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig.5 A). Coincubation of 10 μg/ml mAb 2392 with TLR2-transfected cells in the presence of 10 μg/ml iPGN significantly reduced the NF-κB activity to the level of ∼15% of that in the absence of antibody. This is essentially consistent with the results observed for cytokine secretion in THP-CD14 cells (36Tapping R.I. Akashi S. Miyake K. Godowski P.J. Tobias P.S. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 5780-5787Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar) and supports the idea that the epitope of mAb 2392 is located at the TLR2 region that is involved in PGN recognition. However, 10 μg/ml mAb TL2.3 failed to attenuate the iPGN-induced NF-κB activation. The effects of mAbs on the binding of sTLR2 to iPGN were also examined (Fig. 5 B). mAb 2392 significantly decreased the binding of sTLR2 to iPGN in a dose-dependent manner. The binding of sTLR2 to iPGN in the presence of 10 μg/ml mAb 2392 was reduced to the level of 35% of that in the absence of the mAb. In contrast, 10 μg/ml mAb TL2.3 did not attenuate the binding of sTLR2 to iPGN. Its level was almost comparable with that obtained in the presence of control mouse IgG. The results support the conclusion obtained from the direct binding assay that the extracellular TLR2 domain directly binds iPGN. We next investigated the interaction of sCD14 with sTLR2. When 0–20 μg/ml of sCD14 were incubated with sTLR2 coated onto microtiter wells, sCD14 bound to sTLR2 in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig.6 A). When sTLR2 and sCD14 were preincubated together, the binding of sTLR2 to iPGN increased by 23% compared with that of sTLR2 alone (Fig. 6 B). Coincubation of these proteins also enhanced the binding of sCD14 to iPGN by 27% (Fig.6 C). These results indicate that sCD14 can interact with sTLR2 and that coincubation of sTLR2 and sCD14 enhances the binding of each protein to iPGN. In this report we demonstrated that the extracellular domain of TLR2 directly binds PGN. To determine the direct interaction of TLR2 with PGN, we generated the soluble form of recombinant TLR2 possessing only the putative extracellular domain. sTLR2 bound to iPGN coated onto microtiter wells in a concentration-dependent manner. Because we were unable to quantify the amount of iPGN binding to the wells, we conducted the binding assay in solution with sedimentable iPGN. Consistent with the microtiter well binding, sTLR2 cosedimented with iPGN. Taken together, these results clearly demonstrate that the extracellular domain of TLR2 directly binds to iPGN. When the binding of sTLR2 to iPGN was compared with that to LPS (Fig.2 C), sTLR2 exhibited a measurable but very weak binding to LPS. The small amount of sTLR2 binding to LPS may have been due to the contaminants contained in the LPS preparation, because one recent study (13Hirschfeld M., Ma, Y. Weis J.H. Vogek S.N. Weis J.J. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 618-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (973) Google Scholar) indicates that commercial preparation of LPS contained low levels of highly bioactive contaminants, endotoxin protein, which is responsible for the TLR2-mediated signaling observed upon LPS stimulation, and that repurification of LPS eliminates cell signaling mediated through TLR2. The current study indicating the avid binding of sTLR2 to iPGN is essentially consistent with the previous in vivo and in vitro studies (17Schwandner R. Dziarski R. Wesche H. Rothe M. Kirschning C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17406-17409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1438) Google Scholar, 21Takeuchi O. Hoshino K. Kawai T. Sanjo H. Takada H. Ogawa T. Takeda K. Akira S. Immunity. 1999; 11: 443-451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2800) Google Scholar) showing that TLR2 functions as a physiological receptor for PGN but not for LPS. Coincubation of sTLR2 with iPGN partially neutralized both iPGN-induced NF-κB activation in TLR2-transfected HEK 293 cells and IL-8 secretion in U937 cells (Fig. 4). It is likely that the interaction of sTLR2 with iPGN causes the decreased binding of iPGN to TLR2 expressed on cell surfaces, resulting in the attenuated cell signaling. The naturally occurring soluble form of mouse TLR4 that is expressed by alternatively spliced mouse TLR4 mRNA has been shown to attenuate but not completely inhibit LPS-elicited NF-κB activities to the level of 50–60% of those observed for controls (38Iwami K. Matsuguchi T. Masuda A. Kikuchi T. Musikacharoen T. Yoshikai Y. J. Immunol. 2001; 165: 6682-6686Crossref Scopus (230) Google Scholar). These results indicate that the extracellular TLR domain alone does not explain all the activity of TLR-ligand interaction. Although it is unclear why the soluble form of TLRs did not completely inhibit cell signaling, it is possible to assume that the wild type TLRs and the soluble form of the extracellular TLR domain lacking the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains may differ in affinities for the ligands. Actually the affinity (the apparent K d = 67 × 10−9m) of sTLR2 for iPGN was not so high as was expected. It is uncertain whether wild type TLR2 on cell surfaces interacts with PGN with the same affinity as sTLR2 constructed. Partial attenuation of iPGN-induced signaling and cytokine secretion by the soluble form of TLR may be a consequence of the binding affinity of the soluble form, which is different from membrane-bound form. Other factors including sCD14 and other classes of TLR may be required for the acquisition of high affinity binding. As shown in Fig. 6, sCD14 interacted with sTLR2 and facilitated the binding of sTLR2 to solid phase iPGN. These results are consistent to the previous studies indicating that PGN-induced NF-κB activation is increased by cotransfection of membrane bound CD14 with TLR2 in HEK 293 cells (17Schwandner R. Dziarski R. Wesche H. Rothe M. Kirschning C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17406-17409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1438) Google Scholar,39Mitsuzawa H. Wada I. Sano H. Iwaki D.

Taken together, these results support the idea that the PGN-induced cellular response is closely related with the direct binding of PGN to the extracellular TLR2 domain. Anti-TLR2 mAb 2392 that had been generated against the extracellular TLR2 domain (35Aliprantis A., O. Yang R.-B. Mark M.R. Sugget S. Devaux B. Radolf J.D. Klimpel G.R. Godowski P. Zychlinski A. Science. 1999; 285: 736-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (1278) Google Scholar) was reported to inhibit PGN-induced cytokine release from THP1-CD14 cells (36Tapping R.I. Akashi S. Miyake K. Godowski P.J. Tobias P.S. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 5780-5787Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Likewise, this study showed that mAb 2392 inhibited NF-κB activity induced by iPGN in TLR2-transfected 293 cells (Fig. 5 A). mAb 2392 also significantly decreased the binding of sTLR2 to solid phase iPGN (Fig. 5 B). Although the epitope for this monoclonal antibody has not been identified, the extracellular TLR2 region contiguous to the antibody epitope may be critical for ligand recognition. In contrast, another mAb TL2.3 failed to inhibit iPGN-induced NF-κB activation and sTLR2 binding to iPGN (Fig. 5). These results may give specificity and biological relevance to the experiments. The study supports the idea that the direct binding of the extracellular TLR2 domain initiates iPGN-induced cell signaling. One recent study (26da Silva Correia J. Soldau K. Christen U. Tobias P.S. Ulevitch R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21129-21135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar) has revealed that LPS is cross-linked specifically to TLR4 and MD-2 only in the cells expressing CD14, indicating the direct binding of LPS to TLR4. In addition, the study has shown that LPS is cross-linked to TLR2 even when CD14 and MD-2 are not transfected. This study indicates that TLR2 directly binds to PGN in the absence of CD14. These studies suggest that TLR2, unlike TLR4, does not require CD14 to bind the ligand, supporting the idea that the mechanism of TLR2-ligand interaction is different from that of TLR4. In conclusion, we demonstrated that the extracellular TLR2 domain directly binds PGN. The conclusion obtained from this study using the cell-free system is consistent with that obtained from the study using the cells with transient transfection, showing that TLR directly binds its ligand and that the TLR-ligand interaction does not require cellular energy (26da Silva Correia J.

A feature of a large number of cardiac and virtually all of the smooth muscle-expressed genes to date is their dependence upon a consensus sequence CC(A/T)6GG, a high affinity binding site for SRF. As a member of an ancient DNA-binding protein family, SRF shares a highly conserved DNA-binding/dimerization domain of 90 amino acids termed the MADS box. SRF serves as a versatile protein that binds to its cognate sites in a multitude of promoters to integrate intracellular signals and assists as a docking surface for the binding of accessory factors that may confer the regulation of specific gene programs (1Belaguli N.S.

SRF is a key regulator of immediate early gene expression, which frequently results in mitogenesis, and also a key regulator of myogenic terminal differentiation. Most SRF accessory proteins identified as coregulators of c-fosinduction also act as endpoints of growth factor-induced signal transduction cascades. In contrast to the c-fos gene, which contains a single high affinity SRE, many muscle-specific genes including skeletal, cardiac, and smooth muscle α-actins contain combinations of at least three or more strong and weak affinity SREs that bind SRF in a highly cooperative manner and do not contain an adjacent ETS sequence (6Mack C.P.

Collateral accessory factors may then play essential roles in either facilitating or impeding SRF binding on multi-SRE muscle gene promoters, thus stimulating or repressing the transcription of SRF-dependent gene targets. The recent homologous recombinant knock-out of the murineSRF gene locus supports the observation that SRF is absolutely required for the appearance of cardiac mesoderm during mouse embryogenesis (9Arsenian S. Weinhold B. Oelgeschlager M. Ruther U. Nordheim A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6289-6299Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). One of the SRF cofactors is Nkx2-5, a homeobox vertebrate homologue of Drosophila tinman(10Azpiazu N. Frasch M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1325-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar, 11Bodmer R.

We determined that the Nkx2-5 target sequences resemble the AT-rich central core of the serum response element and subsequently demonstrated that Nkx2-5 binds weakly to the consensus SREs of the αCA promoter. Nkx2-5 is also recruited by SRF to SREs, resulting in modest activation of endogenousαCA gene transcription (2Chen C.Y. Schwartz R.J. Mol. Cell.

In addition, Nkx2-5 can associate with the dual C4 zinc finger transcription factor GATA4 to activate a variety of cardiac specified genes (14Sepulveda J.L. Belaguli N. Nigam V. Chen C.Y. Nemer M.

Recently, Nishida et al. (19Nishida W. Nakamura M. Mori S. Takahashi M. Ohkawa Y. Tadokoro S. Yoshida K. Hiwada K. Hayashi K. Sobue K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7308-7317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) showed that the triad of SRF, Nkx-3.2, and GATA-6 was coexpressed in the medial smooth muscle layer of arteries. These factors transactivated the promoters of smooth muscle genes including β1 integrin, SM22, and caldesmon genes. This triad of factors provides transcriptional potency similar to the recently identified myocardin, a SAP factor, enriched during cardiogenesis, which also serves as a potent SRF coaccessory factor (20Wang D. Chang P.S. Wang Z. Sutherland L. Richardson J.A. Small E. Krieg P.A. Olson E.N. Cell. 2001; 105: 851-862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar). Herein, we also provide strong evidence for SRF in playing a leading role in the commitment of cardiac progenitors by virtue of its obligatory requirement for acting as a myogenic restricted platform to interact with other early cardiac enriched transcription factors, Nkx2-5 and GATA4. However, in this study, we show that Nkx2-5 and GATA4 facilitate potent activation of the cardiac α-actin promoter via the recruitment of these factors to multiple serum response elements, coincident with the earliest activation of the cardiac α-actin gene in promyocardial and embryonic stem cells. The luciferase reporter vectors described previously (2Chen C.Y. Schwartz R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6372-6384Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Chen C.Y. Croissant J. Majesky M. Topouzis S.

The expression of Nkx2-5, SRF, and GATA4 was controlled by CMV promoter expression vectors described previously (14Sepulveda J.L. Belaguli N. Nigam V. Chen C.Y. Nemer M. Schwartz R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3405-3415Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Insect cell expression vector pAcX-SRF was kindly provided by Dr. Michael Gilman (Ariad Pharmaceuticals) (for review see Ref. 21Natesan S. Gilman M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5975-5982Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). pAcX-GATA4 was constructed by excising a 726-bp fragment from pCG-GATA4 with XbaI andXcmI and a 600-bp band from pBS-GATA4-(1–126) withXcmI and BamH1. The two fragments were ligated into the pAcX vector after the removal of SRF from pAcX SRF withXbaI and BamH1. pAcX-Nkx2-5 was constructed by excising Nkx2-5 from pCGN-Nkx2-5 with XbaI andEcoRI, blunting the ends, and cloning into the pAcX vector after the removal of SRF from pAcX SRF with XbaI andBamH1 and blunting. pAct-Sp1 (22Seto E. Lewis B. Shenk T. Nature. 1993; 365: 462-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar) was a kind gift from Dr. Thomas Shenk (Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ). The plasmid pCMVPA-II expressing a tetramer of the IgG-binding domain of Staphylococcus aureus protein A was a gift from Dr. Peter Uetz (European Molecular Biology Laboratory, Heidelberg, Germany) (for review see Ref. 23Uetz P. Zeller R. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 237: 161-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). SRF was excised from pCGN-SRF with XbaI and ligated into the same site of pCMVPA-II, resulting in protein A fused to the N terminus of SRF. Chick embryos at Hamburger-Hamilton (HH) stage 8 (∼4 somites) and HH10 (∼10 somites) were fixed in MEMFA (0.1 m MOPS, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mmMgSO4, 3.7% paraformaldehyde) and stored in 90% methanol at −20 °C until use for hybridization (24Albrecht B.E. Breitenbach U. Stuhmer T. Harvey R.J. Darlison M.G. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1997; 9: 2414-2422Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The synthesis of digoxigenin-labeled RNA probes corresponding to SRF,Nkx2-5, GATA4, and αCA and whole mount in situ hybridization were performed as described previously (24Albrecht B.E. Breitenbach U. Stuhmer T. Harvey R.J. Darlison M.G. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1997; 9: 2414-2422Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). All of the probes were alkaline-hydrolyzed to the size of ∼300 bp to enhance probe penetration. Cross sections of 10 μm were cut from paraffin-embedded whole mounts. CV1 fibroblasts were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% newborn calf serum. Cells were grown to 50–60% confluence in 6-cm diameter dishes and transfected as described previously (14Sepulveda J.L. Belaguli N. Nigam V. Chen C.Y. Nemer M. Schwartz R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3405-3415Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Drosophila Schneider 2 cells (S2) were grown in serum-free Sf-900 II serum-free medium (Invitrogen) at 26 °C and passaged every week by diluting the culture 20-fold with the same medium. Before transfection, cells were placed into 12-well plates (∼5 × 104 cells/well) and cultured overnight or until ∼50% confluent. For each well, a total of 400 ng of plasmid DNA (200 ng of expression vectors and 200 ng of reporter vector) were mixed with 0.6 μl of FuGENE 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in 100 μl of Sf-900 medium and incubated for 10–20 min at room temperature. This mixture was then added to the cells. After 48 h, the plates were centrifuged at 1000 × g for 5 min, the supernatant was discarded, and the cells were lysed in 100 μl of reporter lysis buffer (Promega). The processing of extracts and luciferase assays was done as described previously (14Sepulveda J.L. Belaguli N. Nigam V. Chen C.Y. Nemer M. Schwartz R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3405-3415Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Nearly confluent AB2.1 murine embryonic stem cells were incubated in M15 medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen), 15% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen), 0.1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 2.0 mm glutamine, 0.05 mg/ml streptomycin, 0.03 mg/ml penicillin) 2 h prior to manipulation. ES cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and trypsinized (0.25% trypsin) for ∼5 min. ES cells were washed with M15 medium, counted, and plated at a density of 2 × 104 cells/ml in M15 medium onto tissue culture dishes coated with 0.1% gelatin. After 2 days in culture, ES cells were cotransfected in combinations with either pCGN (2 μg), pCGN-Nkx2-5 (2 μg), or pCGN-SRF (2 μg) by LipofectAMINE (GIBCO). Three days later, total RNA were isolated from individual transfections, and the expression of endogenous cardiac restricted genes was analyzed by RT-PCR. The expression of endogenousαCA gene activity was analyzed by RT-PCR as described previously. The authenticity of the amplified products was determined by using a 32P-labeled 3′ gene-specific primer and analyzed on a 8% polyacrylamide gel and quantified following 24, 26, and 28 cycles by Betagen autoradiography. The primers for αCAwere 5′-GCTCCCAGCACATGAAG-3′ (5′ primer), 5′-GGCTAAGAGAGAGACATC-3′ (3′ primer 1), and 5′-ATCTCAGAAGCACTTGCGGTG-3′ (3′ primer 2), and the primers for GAPDH were 5′-ACCAAGTCCATGCCATCAC-3′ (5′ primer) and 5′-TCCACCACCCTGTTGCTGTA-3′ (3′ primer). Nuclear extracts of transfected cells were prepared by using a mini-extract procedure (25Hennighausen L. Lubon H. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 152: 721-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The protein concentration was determined by the method of Bradford using a Bio-Rad kit. EMSAs were performed with 20-μl reaction mixtures at room temperature as previously described by Chen and Schwartz (2Chen C.Y. Schwartz R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6372-6384Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in which 0.5 μg of poly(dG·dC) was used as a nonspecific competitor. For EMSA antibody interference assays, proteins were incubated with cold antiserum for 5 min before the addition of the probe. Protein A pull-down assays were performed as described previously (14Sepulveda J.L. Belaguli N. Nigam V. Chen C.Y. Nemer M. Schwartz R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3405-3415Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Whole cell extracts from CV1 cells transfected with pCGN-Nkx2-5 and pCG-GATA4 together with plasmids expressing either protein A or protein A-SRF were lysed in EBC buffer, incubated with IgG-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) for 15 min at 4 °C, and washed four times with 500 ul of EBC buffer. Proteins were solubilized in Laemmli's SDS-loading buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, and visualized by immunoblotting with anti-HA and anti-GATA4 antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). Biotinylated αCA promoter DNA was reacted with translated 35S-labeled SRF and GATA4. Casein kinase II was used to label Nkx2-5pm with [α-32P]ATP. DNA binding solution (50 mmNaCl, 15 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 5% glycerol) contained 5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 5 μg of poly(dI·dC) as detailed by Cheng and Schwartz (2Chen C.Y. Schwartz R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6372-6384Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with the addition of 5% fat-free milk. Avidin magnetic beads (Promega) at 100 μg/assay point were concentrated with a magnetic rack (Promega) and repeatedly washed in binding buffer. After the complete removal of binding buffer, the beads were resuspended in SDS-loading buffer, split into two equal fractions, and analyzed by SDS-10% PAGE. SRF, GATA4, and Nkx2-5 gene expression patterns were mapped to determine whether they coincided with that of cardiac restricted αCA gene activity, a marker for committed cardiac myocytes. Whole mount-sectioned in situ hybridized chick embryos (Fig.1) revealed that by HH stage 8 (∼4 somites), cNkx2-5, cSRF, cGATA4, andαCA have overlapping patterns of expression with the anterior intestinal portal (AIP) marking the apex of expression (Fig.1, A–D). However, SRF and αCA are not expressed in the medial AIP (Fig. 1, B and D,d and j). At the level of the AIP,cNkx2-5 was expressed throughout the mesoderm and endoderm (Fig. 1 E, a), whereas GATA4 was expressed only in the endoderm (Fig. 1 G, g). In the paired heart tubes, both genes were expressed in the mesoderm (Fig.1 C, h) The first somite marks the posterior border of cSRF and cGATA4 expression (Fig. 1,F and G), but cNkx2-5 expression barely extends to this level (Fig. 1 E, c). Thus,SRF expression appears to mark the anterior border ofαCA expression, whereas cNkx2-5 expression appears to coincide with the posterior border. The approximate overlap of SRF mRNA with Nkx2-5 and GATA4transcripts was coincident with αCA gene activity and the appearance of the myocardial cells (as shown in Fig. 1 b,e, h, and k). At HH stage 10 (∼10 somites), the heart tube is fused at the midline, andcNkx2-5, cSRF, and αCA were expressed throughout the straight heart tube (Fig. 1, E,F, and H), whereas cGATA4 expression is primarily in the sinus venosus. By HH stage 10, all four genes were expressed in the myocardium. The reporter plasmid αCA-luciferase contains the avian αCA promoter from −315 to +15 relative to the transcription start site. When cotransfected with SRF alone,αCA-luciferase activity varied between 6- and 10-fold, whereas GATA4 or Nkx2-5 alone resulted in only 1–4-fold transcriptional activation in CV1 fibroblasts. The pairings of SRF and GATA4 resulted in the coactivation of ∼20–30-fold above the basal level. The transfection of all of the three factors resulted in robust synergistic activation of the αCA promoter to levels up to 160-fold (Fig. 2 A). In contrast, no coactivation was seen with the SV40 promoter (data not shown). Fig.2 B shows robust expression of plasmid DNA expression vectors driving wild-type gene activity of transfected CV1 fibroblasts as detected by antibody protein blots. These results suggest that most of the synergistic coactivation requires the efficient binding of SRF to the SRE. Consistent with this idea, the cotransfection of SRFpm1, a triple point mutant of SRF that weakens DNA binding with GATA4 and Nkx2-5, resulted in a 75% reduction in coactivation (Fig. 2,A and C). To investigate whether triad factor coactivation requires the binding of Nkx2-5 to the αCA promoter, the non-DNA-binding mutant Nkx2-5pm, a point mutation (Asn to Gln) at position 10 of the DNA recognition helix, was substituted for wild-type Nkx2-5 in the cotransfection assay with SRF and GATA4 (Fig.2, A and C). No reduction in activity was noted. In fact, a small increase of ∼15% reporter activity was seen. These findings suggest that as shown for the interaction of Nkx2-5 with SRF (2Chen C.Y. Schwartz R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6372-6384Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the binding of Nkx2-5 to the αCA promoter is not required and may actually decrease the efficiency of the coactivation with SRF and GATA4. It is conceivable that the interaction of Nkx2-5 with SRF and GATA4 allows the activation domain of Nkx2-5 to contribute significantly to the synergistic effect as demonstrated in cotransfection assays of Nkx2-5 plus GATA4 (14Sepulveda J.L.

To investigate whether other members of the Nk2 family are also able to cooperate with SRF and GATA4 in a triple interaction, cotransfections were performed as described above, substituting Nkx2-5 for Nkx2-1 (TTF1), Nkx2-8, and D. tinman (Fig. 2 C). The results showed that although Nkx2-1 and D. tinman were able to replace Nkx2-5 albeit at a lower efficiency, Nkx2-8 was unable to cooperate with SRF and GATA4 in activating the αCA promoter, indicating nonequivalent roles for the Nkx2 factors. Drosophila S2 cells, which are devoid of significant SRF expression (21Natesan S. Gilman M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5975-5982Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), allowed us to study the activation of theαCA promoter in the absence of endogenous SRF. The transfection of SRF into S2 cells resulted in minimal (2-fold) activation of the αCA promoter (Fig. 2 D). Transfection of VP16-SRF resulted in 190-fold activation of the same promoter (results not shown), indicating that this promoter binds SRF and is functional in S2 cells, whereas the natural activation domain of SRF is relatively weak in S2 cells. Similarly, GATA4 and Nkx2-5 by themselves or in combination did not significantly activate theαCA promoter in these cells. A double transfection of SRF with GATA4 or with Nkx2-5 resulted in activation below the additive level (<3 times). However, triple cotransfection of SRF, GATA4, and Nkx2-5 resulted in synergistic (13-fold) stimulation of the αCA promoter. We also observed that the removal of the strong inhibitory C-terminal domain in the Nkx2-5 mutant Nkx2-5-(1–203) was by itself a weak activator of αCA (3 times) but a much stronger coactivator with SRF (18-fold) and with GATA4 and SRF (40-fold). These results together with the cotransfection experiments in CV1 fibroblasts (Fig. 2, A and C) (for review see Ref. 14Sepulveda J.L. Belaguli N. Nigam V. Chen C.Y. Nemer M. Schwartz R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3405-3415Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar) suggest that GATA4 activated Nkx2-5 by the removal of the repressive effect of the C-terminal domain of Nkx2-5. Moreover, the interaction of Nkx2-5 and GATA4 on the αCA promoter was mediated by exogenous SRF in insect cells, because the level of activation in the absence of SRF is minimal. Sp1 has been reported to physically interact with GATA1 (27Fischer K.D. Haese A. Nowock J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23915-23923Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Gregory R.C.

Biochem. 1998; 70: 366-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and to functionally interact with SRF to regulate the αCA promoter (32Sartorelli V. Webster K.A. Kedes L. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1811-1822Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 33MacLellan W.R. Lee T.C. Schwartz R.J. Schneider M.D. J. Biol.

Biol. 1999; 19: 2577-2584Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Because S2 cells have been shown to lack Sp1 (22Seto E. Lewis B. Shenk T. Nature. 1993; 365: 462-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar), we then asked whether Sp1 interacts with these factors. When Sp1 was cotransfected into S2 cells with a minimal promoter containing multimerized Sp1 sites, luciferase activity was 160-fold compared with the same promoter without Sp1 sites (results not shown). However, Sp1 alone or with SRF had minimal effect on αCA-luciferase (Fig. 2 D). Sp1 had only an additive effect on the coactivation of the αCA promoter by SRF plus GATA4 and reduced coactivation by SRF plus GATA4 and Nkx2-5 (Fig. 2 D). These results indicate that Sp1 does not stimulate αCA transcription via interactions through this triad of factors. Is the coexpression of Nkx2-5, GATA4, and SRF capable of activating the endogenous αCA gene? The expression vectors encoding these transcription factors were transiently transfected into pluripotent murine AB2-129 embryonic stem cells.αCA mRNA was not detected in the parental 6-day post-aggregated ES cells transfected with the empty pCGN plasmid as shown in Fig. 3. Increased expression of any one of these factors in ES cells reproducibly elicited significant transcription of the αCA gene. SRF and GATA4 alone were sufficient to increase αCA transcripts by 40-fold over control ES cells. The paired groupings of SRF with GATA4 or with Nkx2-5 stimulated αCA activity ∼30% more than the combination of Nkx2-5 and GATA4 (Fig. 3). The combination of SRF, Nkx2-5, and GATA4 induced αCA mRNA levels over 100-foldversus control levels, indicating a central role for SRF in directing embryonic cardiac gene expression. How does Nkx2-5, GATA4, and SRF driveαCA activity? SRF binds to a variety of SREs including the four avian αCA SREs and to the greatest extent to the first (SRE1) and fourth (SRE4) SREs. Non-consensus second (SRE2) and third (SRE3) SREs contain a single GC substitution in the six AT-rich SRE core, and all of these SREs are highly conserved across the evolution of Aves and mammals (35Carroll S.L. Bergsma D.J. Schwartz R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 241-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 36Taylor A. Erba H.P. Muscat G.E. Kedes L. Genomics. 1988; 3: 323-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). SRE2 and SRE3 are weak SRF binding sites that resemble preferred Nkx2-5 binding elements (2Chen C.Y. Schwartz R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6372-6384Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and also contain overlapping inhibitory YY1 binding sites (3Chen C.Y. Croissant J. Majesky M. Topouzis S. McQuinn T. Frankovsky M.J. Schwartz R.J. Dev. Genet. 1996; 19: 119-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). SeveralαCA promoter mutants (Fig.4) linked to the luciferase reporter gene were cotransfected with the three cofactors in CV1 fibroblasts to assay their transcriptional activities (Fig. 4). The wild-type promoter activity in these fibroblasts was set at one and activated ∼58-fold with the SRF, Nkx2-5, and SRF. The mutations over individual SRF binding sites such as SRE1 (57%), SRE2 (35%), and SRE3 (48%) caused substantial inhibition of αCA promoter activity. Although the mutation of the distal SRE4 did not significantly alter transcription, the removal of the promoter sequence (−310 to −200), which included the distal SRE4, decreased promoter activity to 56% of the wild-type value. A further removal of additional 50-bp promoter sequence, construct del-150 that consists of the weak SRE2 and the strong SRE1, reduced the promoter activity to the lowest level approximately equal to −100 del with a mutated SRE1 (−100+SRE1M). The deletion of SRE2 to −100 del tripled the promoter activity. These results suggest that a negative regulatory element between −150 and −100 is probably SRE2, and that negative-acting YY1 binding to this element is dominant over the positive regulators SRF Nkx-2.5 and GATA4. In addition, we found that the mutant Nkx2-5pm efficiently coactivated in the presence of all four SREs but was substantially weakened when individual SREs were mutated and or deleted. In contrast, the introduction of SRFpm blocked the activatio"
https://openalex.org/W2140179680,"The human kallikreins are a large multigene family of closely related serine-type proteases. In this regard, they are similar to the multigene kallikrein families characterized in mice and rats. There is a much more extensive body of knowledge regarding the function of mouse and rat kallikreins in comparison with the human kallikreins. Human kallikrein 6 has been proposed as the homologue to rat myelencephalon-specific protease, an arginine-specific degradative-type protease abundantly expressed in the central nervous system and implicated in demyelinating disease. We present the x-ray crystal structure of mature, active recombinant human kallikrein 6 at 1.75-A resolution. This high resolution model provides the first three-dimensional view of one of the human kallikreins and one of only a few structures of serine proteases predominantly expressed in the central nervous system. Enzymatic data are presented that support the identification of human kallikrein 6 as the functional homologue of rat myelencephalon-specific protease and are corroborated by a molecular phylogenetic analysis. Furthermore, the x-ray data provide support for the characterization of human kallikrein 6 as a degradative protease with structural features more similar to trypsin than the regulatory kallikreins."

https://openalex.org/W1981336142,"Previous studies have shown that exposure of cells to Zn2+ ions induces Ras and MAPK activation through the EGF receptor (EGFR). To further determine the role of EGFR in Zn2+-induced signaling, mouse B82L fibroblasts expressing no detectable EGFR protein (B82L-par), wild type EGFR (B82L-wt), kinase-deficient EGFR (B82L-K721M), or COOH-truncated EGFR (B82L-c'958) were tested. Exposure to Zn2+ induced Ras activity in B82L-wt, B82L-K721M, and B82L-c'958 but not in B82L-par cells, indicating that the tyrosine kinase domain and the auto-phosphorylation sites of the EGFR were not required for Zn2+-induced Ras activation. Zn2+ induced Src activation in all B82L cell lines, including B82L-par, indicating that Src activation is independent of the presence of the EGFR. A Src kinase inhibitor blocked Zn2+-induced Ras activation in all the B82L cell lines capable of this response, suggesting the involvement of Src kinase in Zn2+-induced Ras activation via the EGFR. Zn2+ induced the association of the EGFR with Src and specifically increased the phosphorylation of EGFR at tyrosine 845 (Tyr-845), a known Src phosphorylation site. Stably transfected B82L cells with a point mutation of the EGFR at Tyr-845 (B82L-Y845F) exhibited only basal Ras activity following exposure to Zn2+. These data demonstrate that Src-dependent phosphorylation of the EGFR at Tyr-845 is required for EGFR transactivation and Zn2+-induced Ras activation. Previous studies have shown that exposure of cells to Zn2+ ions induces Ras and MAPK activation through the EGF receptor (EGFR). To further determine the role of EGFR in Zn2+-induced signaling, mouse B82L fibroblasts expressing no detectable EGFR protein (B82L-par), wild type EGFR (B82L-wt), kinase-deficient EGFR (B82L-K721M), or COOH-truncated EGFR (B82L-c'958) were tested. Exposure to Zn2+ induced Ras activity in B82L-wt, B82L-K721M, and B82L-c'958 but not in B82L-par cells, indicating that the tyrosine kinase domain and the auto-phosphorylation sites of the EGFR were not required for Zn2+-induced Ras activation.

The EGFR family of receptor tyrosine kinases in mammals is composed of four members: EGFR (ErbB1), ErbB2, ErbB3, and ErbB4 (14Ushiro H. Cohen S. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 8363-8365Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Of these, EGFR, an 1186-amino acid residue transmembrane glycoprotein (15Ullrich A. Coussens L. Hayflick J.S. Dull T.J.

Schlessinger J. et al.Nature. 1984; 309: 418-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (1971) Google Scholar), is the prototypal member of this superfamily and is expressed in many cell types (16Wells A. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 31: 637-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar). Structurally, EGFR consists of an extracellular ligand binding domain, a single α-helical transmembrane pass, an intracellular tyrosine kinase domain, and a COOH-terminal region that contains autophosphorylation sites (15Ullrich A. Coussens L. Hayflick J.S. Dull T.J. Gray A. Tam A.W. Lee J. Yarden Y. Libermann T.A. Schlessinger J. et al.Nature. 1984; 309: 418-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (1971) Google Scholar, 17Ullrich A.

Upon binding of specific polypeptide ligands, including EGF, transforming growth factor-α, betacellulin, heparin-binding EGF, epiregulin, and amphiregulin, EGFR undergoes homo- or heterodimerization and activation of its intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity (17Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1990; 61: 203-212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4569) Google Scholar, 21Carraway 3rd, K.L. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1994; 78: 5-8Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar). These events lead to the autophosphorylation of multiple tyrosine residues in the COOH-terminal tail of the molecule that serve as binding sites for cytosolic signaling proteins containing Src homology 2 (SH2) domains and phosphotyrosine binding domains (20Pawson T.

Five sites of in vivo autophosphorylation have been identified in the EGFR: three major (tyrosines 1068, 1148, and 1173) and two minor (tyrosines 992 and 1086) (18Walton G.M. Chen W.S. Rosenfeld M.G.

EMBO J. 1990; 9: 4375-4380Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). The binding of phosphorylated EGFR tyrosines with downstream signaling proteins initiates multiple signaling cascades that culminate in cell proliferation, migration, protein secretion, differentiation, and/or oncogenesis (16Wells A. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 31: 637-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar). Among these signaling pathways, the Shc/Grb2/Sos/Ras/MAPK cascade is a major mitogenic signaling pathway initiated by the EGFR (26Blenis J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5889-5892Crossref PubMed Scopus (1151) Google Scholar). EGFR is also part of signaling networks transactivated by stimuli that do not directly interact with this receptor. These stimuli include agonists that specifically bind to other membrane receptors, membrane depolarization agents, and environmental stressors (27Carpenter G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 697-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). The mechanisms for the transactivation of EGFR vary with the cell type and stimuli (27Carpenter G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 697-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Cellular Src functions as a co-transducer of transmembrane signals emanating from a variety of growth factor receptors, including EGFR (28Luttrell D.K. Luttrell L.M. Parsons S.J. Mol. Cell.

Devlin R.B. Reed W. Samet J.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: L924-L931PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we examined the mechanisms involved in Zn2+-induced EGFR-mediated signaling, especially the possible cooperation of EGFR with Src. We found that an intact tyrosine at 845 of EGFR (Tyr-845) was necessary for Zn2+-induced Ras activation. However, the tyrosine kinase and autophosphorylation sites within EGFR were dispensable. Furthermore, Zn2+ was found to activate Src kinase and induce its association with EGFR. These results indicate that Ras activation triggered by Zn2+ is dependent on Src-mediated phosphorylation of EGFR at Tyr-845. American Chemical Society-grade metal salt Zinc sulfate was obtained from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO). SDS-PAGE supplies such as molecular mass standards, polyacrylamide, ready gels, and buffers were from Bio-Rad (Richmond, CA). Phospho-EGFR (Tyr-845), phospho-EGFR (Tyr-1068), and phospho-Src (Tyr-416) antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Monoclonal anti-EGFR antibody LA22, human recombinant EGF, and anti-Src antibody (clone GD11) were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). Rabbit polyclonal anti-EGFR antibody (1005), horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or goat anti-mouse IgG were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Monoclonal anti-EGFR antibody Ab14 was obtained from Neomarkers (Fremont, CA). PP1 was purchased from BIOMOL Research Laboratories, Inc. (Plymouth Meeting, PA). LipofectAMINE transfection reagents were purchased from Invitrogen. The B82L parental fibroblasts (B82L-par) and B82L fibroblasts expressing the human wild type EGFR (B82L-wt), kinase-defective EGFR (B82L-K721M), and the COOH-terminally truncated EGFR at Tyr-958 (B82L-c'958) have been described previously (36Welsh J.B.

Nature. 1987; 328: 820-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). B82L-par fibroblasts were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal bovine serum. A mutant dihydrofolate reductase gene provides a dominant selectable marker for the B82L cells overexpressing the EGFR (38Lin C.R. Chen W.S. Lazar C.S. Carpenter C.D. Gill G.N. Evans R.M.

A. 1983; 80: 2495-2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Prior to experiments methotrexate was removed for at least 24 h. Confluent B82L cells were then incubated in serum-free DMEM for 18–20 h before stimulation with zinc sulfate or EGF. A solution of 100 mm zinc sulfate was prepared in distilled water and used as a stock for dilution into serum-free DMEM. The final concentration of Zn2+ was 500 μm, and that of EGF was 100 ng/ml. The EGFR (Y845F) construct was described previously (34Biscardi J.S. Maa M.C. Tice D.A. Cox M.E. Leu T.H. Parsons S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8335-8343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar, 35Tice D.A. Biscardi J.S. Nickles A.L. Parsons S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1415-1420Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). The B82L-par cells were grown to 80% confluence and transfected with the EGFR (Y845F) construct using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen). Specifically, 10 μg of the plasmid DNA was incubated with 60 μl of LipofectAMINE reagent for 30 min at room temperature. Transfection mixtures were diluted into Opti-MEM I reduced serum medium (Invitrogen), and the diluted complex solution was overlaid onto the subconfluent cells in 100-mm culture dishes. After incubating with B82L-par cells for 6 h at 37 °C, the transfection mixture was removed and replaced with fresh DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum. The transfected cells were passaged in DMEM containing 1000 μg/ml Geneticin (Invitrogen). After five passages, several colonies were picked and characterized for EGFR protein expression and phosphorylation using specific antibodies. Confluent B82L cells pretreated with vehicle or kinase inhibitor were treated with 500 μm Zn2+ or 100 ng/ml EGF for 20 min. Cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and lysed with RIPA buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS in PBS, pH 7.4) containing 0.1 mm vanadyl sulfate and protease inhibitors (0.5 mg/ml aprotinin, 0.5 mg/ml trans-epoxy succinyl-l-leucylamido-(4-guanidino)butane (E-64), 0.5 mg/ml pepstatin, 0.5 mg/ml bestatin, 10 mg/ml chymostatin, and 0.1 ng/ml leupeptin). After normalization for protein content, cell extracts were subjected to SDS-PAGE on 11% gradient PAGE gels or 4–15% Tris-HCl ready gels from Bio-Rad (Richmond, CA) with a Tris-glycine-SDS buffer. Proteins were electro-blotted onto nitrocellulose membrane. The blots were blocked with 3% nonfat milk, washed briefly, incubated with phospho-specific antibodies in 3% bovine serum albumin at 4 °C overnight, and then incubated with HRP-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature. Bands were detected using chemiluminescence reagents on film as described previously (2Samet J.M. Graves L.M. Quay J. Dailey L.A. Devlin R.B. Ghio A.J., Wu, W. Bromberg P.A. Reed W. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: L551-L558Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A Ras activation assay kit was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). Ras activity was determined according to the supplier's instruction. B82L cells treated with zinc sulfate were lysed with 5 × Mg2+lysis/wash buffer (MLB) (125 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 750 mm NaCl, 5% Nonidet P-40, 50 mmMgCl2, 5 mm EDTA, and 10% glycerol). 500–1000 μg of cell lysate was precleared with glutathione agarose. 5 μl of a 50% slurry of Raf-1 RBD (Ras binding domain)-agarose was incubated with the lysate at 4 °C for 30 min. The agarose was collected by centrifugation and washed with MLB three times and once with cold PBS, then boiled in 25 μl of reducing sample loading buffer. GTP-bound Ras protein was resolved by electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose before being probed with a mouse monoclonal anti-Ras (clone Ras10) antibody (1 μg/ml). Protein bands were visualized using a goat anti-mouse secondary antibody conjugated to HRP and an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (12Wu W. Graves L.M. Jaspers I. Devlin R.B. Reed W. Samet J.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: L924-L931PubMed Google Scholar). Confluent B82L cells were treated with zinc sulfate for 20 min and lysed with RIPA lysis buffer. The lysates were pre-cleared with Protein A-Sepharose and immunoprecipitated with agarose-conjugated anti-EGFR antibody for 1 h at 4 °C. Immune complexes were washed twice with RIPA buffer and once with cold PBS. The immunoprecipitates were suspended in 25 μl of 4× sample loading buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, 2% SDS, 0.7 mβ-mercaptoethanol, 0.05% bromphenol blue) and boiled for 5 min before separation on 4–15% Tris-HCl ready gels. The protein was transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane and incubated with anti-Src mouse monoclonal IgG1 at 4 °C overnight. The EGFR-associated Src bands were detected with HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody using ECL chemiluminescence regents as described above. Schematic representations of human wild type EGFR and three EGFR mutants are shown in Fig.1. The three EGFR mutants include a construct encoding a kinase-inactive receptor that contains a lysine to methionine substitution at position 721 (B82L-K721M), which was involved in ATP binding, a construct encoding a kinase-active receptor truncated at Y958 (B82L-c'958), which lacks all five EGFR autophosphorylation sites, and a construct encoding a mutant EGFR at Tyr-845 where the tyrosine residue is replaced with phenylalanine (34Biscardi J.S.

Parsons S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1415-1420Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). No endogenous EGFR protein was detected in B82L-par cells while other transfected B82L cells express abundant EGFR protein (data not shown), which is consistent with previous studies (37Chen W.S.

Ras activation assays showed that exposure of B82L-par cells to Zn2+ or to EGF did not increase GTP-bound Ras after 20 min (Fig. 2 A). In contrast, Zn2+ induced a significant increase in GTP-bound Ras in B82L-wt, B82L-c'958 cells, or B82L-K721M (Fig. 2,B–D), confirming the requirement for EGFR, as suggested by our previous study. Interestingly, Zn2+ increased GTP-bound Ras in cells expressing kinase-inactive and COOH-truncated EGFR demonstrating that neither the tyrosine kinase nor the autophosphorylation sites of EGFR were required for Zn2+-induced Ras activation. These results suggested that EGFR was transactivated in Zn2+-treated cells. In contrast, no increase in GTP-bound Ras was detected in Zn2+-treated B82L-Y845F cells (Fig. 2 E), indicating that EGFR tyrosine 845, which is phosphorylated by c-Src (35Tice D.A. Biscardi J.S.

EGF increased GTP-bound Ras in wt, kinase-inactive K721M and to a lesser extent in c'958 EGFR-expressing cells as previously repeated (39Wright J.D. Reuter C.W. Weber M.J. J. Biol.

To investigate whether Src kinase mediated transactivation of EGFR in Zn2+-exposed cells, we exposed cells to PP1, a potent and selective Src kinase inhibitor (45Hanke J.H. Gardner J.P. Dow R.L.

Pretreatment with PP1 significantly blocked Zn2+-induced Ras activation in B82L-wt (Fig. 3), whereas PP1 had no inhibitory effect on EGF-induced Ras activation. These results indicate that Src activity is required for Zn2+- but not for EGF-induced Ras activation. Similar results were obtained with B82L-c'958 or B82L-K721M cell lines used in this study (data not shown). To exclude the possibility that PP1 affected the intrinsic kinase activity of EGFR, EGF-induced receptor autophosphorylation was examined in B82L-wt cells that were pretreated with PP1.

To determine whether Zn2+ affected c-Src, we examined the effects of Zn2+ on Src using a phospho-specific anti-Src (Y416) antibody. Phosphorylation of Src Y416 is part of the enzyme activation mechanism (47Thomas S.M. Brugge J.S. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 513-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (2134) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.4, exposure to Zn2+ for 20 min induced the phosphorylation of Y416 on Src in B82L-par (Fig.4 A), B82L-wt (Fig. 4 B), B82L-c'958 (Fig.4 C), and B82L-K721M (Fig. 4 D) cell lines. These results further support the hypothesis that Src activation is involved in EGFR phosphorylation. Src phosphorylation was also detected in the B82L-Y845F cell line (Fig. 4 E) wherein the known Src phosphorylation site Tyr-845 on EGFR was replaced with phenylalanine. These data indicated that activation of Src occurred independent of the existence of EGFR Tyr-845. In some cell types (B82L-wt, B82L-K721M, or B82L-Y845F) EGF also increased phosphorylation of Src, and the magnitude of the increase was always less than those induced by Zn2+ (Fig. 4). Next, we determined whether Zn2+ induces a physical association between EGFR and Src in B82L-wt (Fig.5 A), B82L-c'958 (Fig.5 B), B82L-K721M (Fig. 5 C), and B82L-Y845F (Fig.5 D) cell lines. Immunoprecipitation of EGFR followed by immunoblotting with anti-Src antibody revealed that treatment with Zn2+ for 20 min caused a co-localization of EGFR with Src in these cell lines. In contrast, treatment with EGF for 20 min did not result in an interaction between Src and EGFR (Fig. 5). The finding that mutation of EGFR Tyr-845 prevented Zn2+-induced Ras activation suggested that phosphorylation of this site was essential for transactivation of EGFR in cells exposed to Zn2+. To further test this hypothesis we examined the phosphorylation of this site using a phospho-specific antibody to Tyr-845 of the EGFR. Zn2+ induced phosphorylation of EGFR at Tyr-845 in B82L-wt (Fig.6 A), B82L-c'958 (Fig.6 B), and B82L-K721M (Fig. 6 C) cells. EGF treatment also increased the phosphorylation of Tyr-845 on EGFR in these cell lines. To determine whether the phosphorylation of Tyr-845 is related to Src activation induced by Zn2+, the effect of PP1 on Zn2+-induced phosphorylation of EGFR Tyr-845 was also examined in these cell lines. PP1 significantly blocked Zn2+-induced phosphorylation of EGFR Tyr-845 in all of the cell lines. In contrast, PP1 only had a slight inhibitory effect on EGF-induced EGFR phosphorylation at Tyr-845 in B82L-wt and B82L-K721M cells. As expected, both Zn2+ and EGF failed to induce phosphorylation of EGFR Tyr-845 in B82L-Y845F cells. Additionally, the phosphorylation of EGFR Tyr-1068, a major EGFR autophosphorylation site (23Downward J. Parker P. Waterfield M.D. Nature. 1984; 311: 483-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar), was also examined in these cell lines stimulated with Zn2+ or EGF. As expected, no phosphorylation of Tyr-1068 in B82L-c'958 cells was observed (Fig.7 B). In addition, Zn2+ failed to induce the phosphorylation of EGFR Tyr-1068 in B82L-wt (Fig. 7 A), B82L-K721 (Fig. 7 C), and B82L-Y845F (Fig. 7 D) cells. In comparison, EGF induced phosphorylation of EGFR Tyr-1068 in each cell type (Fig. 7,A, C, and D).Figure 7Phosphorylation of EGFR Tyr-1068 in B82L cell lines. Subconfluent B82L-wt (A), B82L-c'958 (B), B82L-K721M (C), or B82L-Y845F (D) cells were starved in serum-free DMEM for 24 h before stimulated with 500 μm zinc sulfate or 100 ng/ml EGF for 20 min, respectively. Cells were lysed with RIPA buffer, and cell lysate proteins were resolved with SDS-PAGE. Phosphorylated Tyr-1068 on EGFR was analyzed using phospho-specific EGFR antibody (Tyr-1068). Stripped membranes were blotted with EGFR antibody.

Accumulated evidence indicates that Src kinases, calcium, the Ca2+-regulated focal adhesion kinase family kinase Pyk2, protein kinase C, Janus, and tyrosine kinase Jak2 play crucial roles in the process of EGFR transactivation (48Prenzel N.

Moreover, the recent identification of Zn2+-dependent metalloproteinases and transmembrane growth factor precursors as critical elements in G protein-coupled receptor-induced EGFR transactivation pathways has defined new components of a cellular communication network of rapidly increasing complexity (51Gschwind A. Zwick E. Prenzel N. Leserer M. Ullrich A. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 1594-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar, 55Daub H. Weiss F.U. Wallasch C. Ullrich A.

In the present study, the mechanisms for Zn2+-induced EGFR signaling were examined in B82L cells expressing wild type, null, or modified versions of EGFR. These results show that Zn2+ions induce Ras activation through a mechanism that requires EGFR but not EGFR tyrosine kinase activity or autophosphorylation sites. Furthermore, an intact tyrosine at Tyr-845 on EGFR is required for Zn2+-induced Ras activation. Zn2+-induced phosphorylation of the EGFR Tyr-845 residue requires Src activation. These data suggest that Zn2+-induced EGFR transactivation occurs through an Src-dependent pathway. Src phosphorylation of EGFR has been mapped to most of the five autophosphorylation sites as well as other novel sites (50Carpenter G. Cohen S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7709-7712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Tyr-845 in the EGFR is not a known autophosphorylation site and has been shown to be phosphorylated by Src both in vivo and in vitro (34Biscardi J.S. Maa M.C. Tice D.A. Cox M.E. Leu T.H. Parsons S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8335-8343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar, 57Sato K. Sato A. Aoto M. Fukami Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 215: 1078-1087Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Our data support a direct phosphorylation of EGFR by c-Src for the following reasons: First, Zn2+ ions induce co-localization of EGFR with Src and Src phosphorylation of Tyr-845 has been reported to occur in an EGFR·Src complex (57Sato K. Sato A. Aoto M. Fukami Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 215: 1078-1087Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The c-Src SH2 domain can bind activated EGFR specifically and directly (58Luttrell D.K. Lee A. Lansing T.J. Crosby R.M. Jung K.D. Willard D. Luther M. Rodriguez M. Berman J. Gilmer T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 83-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 59Sierke S.L. Longo G.M. Koland J.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16456-16466Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), which suggests other kinases may not be necessary to mediate the phosphorylation of Tyr-845 (34Biscardi J.S. Maa M.C. Tice D.A. Cox M.E. Leu T.H. Parsons S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8335-8343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). Other Src-dependent or -independent residues on EGFR may act as docking sites for Src or facilitate the association of EGFR with Src, leading to Src phosphorylation of Tyr-845 (33Stover D.R. Becker M. Liebetanz J. Lydon N.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15591-15597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 34Biscardi J.S. Maa M.C. Tice D.A. Cox M.E. Leu T.H. Parsons S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8335-8343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). However, phosphorylation of Tyr-845 is only one of multiple Src effectors, because Zn2+still induced phosphorylation of Src in the absence of Tyr-845 in B82L-Y845F cells. Second, Src activity is required for the phosphorylation of Tyr-845 as demonstrated with the use of a pharmacological inhibitor of Src kinase activity (PP1). Overexpression of wild type or kinase-deficient Src constructs by other investigators produced results that agreed with these findings (34Biscardi J.S. Maa M.C. Tice D.A. Cox M.E. Leu T.H. Parsons S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8335-8343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar, 35Tice D.A. Biscardi J.S. Nickles A.L. Parsons S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1415-1420Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). The observation that EGF induced a greater extent of tyrosine phosphorylation at Tyr-845 than Zn2+ is likely due to ligand-induced conformational changes that enhance accessibility of this residue (61Moriki T. Maruyama H. Maruyama I.N. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 311: 1011-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Zn2+ ions induced Ras activation in cells expressing kinase-inactive or truncated EGFR where Tyr-845 of EGFR is structurally intact and can be phosphorylated, suggesting that Tyr-845 provides a site of interaction with downstream effectors in Zn2+-induced Ras activation. ErbB2, a preferred dimerization partner of all ErbB proteins (62Graus-Porta D. Beerli R.R. Daly J.M. Hynes N.E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1647-1655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1282) Google Scholar, 63Tzahar E.

Gill G.N. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 539-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 44Deb T.B., Su, L. Wong L. Bonvini E. Wells A. David M. Johnson G.R. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 8900-8909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of EGFR Tyr-1068 by EGF in B82L-K721M cells implied that ErbB2 might play a certain role in EGF-induced signaling (44Deb T.B., Su, L. Wong L. Bonvini E. Wells A. David M. Johnson G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15554-15560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). We have observed that Zn2+ ions and EGF can activate ErbB2 in B82L-wt and B82L-c'958 cells (data not shown). This hypothesis will be examined using specific cell lines with or without expression of ErbB2 (65Noguchi M. Murakami M. Bennett W. Lupu R. Hui F., Jr. Harris C.C. Gerwin B.I. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 2035-2043PubMed Google Scholar) in our laboratory. Although Tyr-845 of EGFR was necessary for Zn2+-induced Ras activation, this site is dispensable for Zn2+-induced EGFR-Src co-localization, because Zn2+ still induced EGFR-Src association in B82L-Y845F cells. Thus, we hypothesize that other sites on EGFR may act as the docking sites for EGFR-Src interaction. Whether there exists a scaffolding protein to assemble these elements remains unknown, although caveolin-1 has been reported to serve as an anchoring site for various signaling molecules in B82L fibroblasts (41Kim Y.N. Wiepz G.J. Guadarrama A.G. Bertics P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7481-7491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar,66Okamoto T. Schlegel A. Scherer P.E. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5419-5422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1336) Google Scholar). Differences in Ras activation by Zn2+ ions and EGF likely reflect differences in the manner in which EGFR is utilized by these stimuli. First, the autophosphorylation sites in the EGFR are unnecessary for Ras activation induced by Zn2+. Unlike EGF, Zn2+ ions do not induce the autophosphorylation of Tyr-1068 in the EGFR. Second, the Tyr-845 residue is required for Zn2+- but not for EGF-induced Ras activation. The phosphorylation of Tyr-845 induced by Zn2+ ions, but not that induced by EGF, is dependent on Src activity. Therefore, Src activation and subsequent phosphorylation of Tyr-845 are crucial steps in the process of Zn2+-induced Ras activation. Other tyrosine phosphorylation sites play a significant role in EGF-induced Ras activation. We have observed a baseline of GTP-bound Ras in all B82L cell lines, which could be suppressed by the Src kinase inhibitor, suggesting that constitutive Src activity may be responsible for the basal activation of Ras. In summary, this study describes a novel mechanism for metal-induced EGFR transactivation, which is likely to be mediated by Src through the phosphorylation site of Tyr-845 on EGFR.

Buchner J. J. Cell. Physiol. 2001; 188: 281-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). Among these proteins are the actin-binding protein calponin (2Gusev N.B. Biochemistry. 2001; 66: 1112-1121PubMed Google Scholar), certain steroid receptors (3Bucci M. Roviezzo F. Cicala C. Sessa W.C. Cirino G. Br. J.

Physiol. 2001; 188: 281-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). A particularly interesting role for Hsp90 is its ability to interact with the endothelial cell nitric-oxide synthase (eNOS). Current evidence indicates that the binding of Hsp90 to eNOS is important for the function of eNOS in response to growth factors, G-protein activation, and mechanotransduction (4Pritchard K.A., Jr. Ackerman A.W. Gross E.R. Stepp D.W. Shi Y. Fontana J.T. Baker J.E. Sessa W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17621-17624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). The ansamycin antibiotic geldanamycin is widely used as a specific inhibitor of the Hsp90, and it has been assigned several cellular functions based on studies using this compound. The role of Hsp90 in promoting tumor cell survival has led to both phase 1 and phase 2 trials of geldanamycin as a chemotherapeutic agent (5Workman P. Maloney A. Expert. Opin. Biol. Ther. 2002; 2: 3-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar), and the National Cancer Institute has recently announced an initiative in developing analogs of geldanamycin as chemotherapeutic agents (6National Institutes of Health Federal Register Online. 2001; 66 (www.tgci.com/fedrgtxt/01-16762.txt): 35443-35444Google Scholar). Geldanamycin contains a quinone group (Fig.1), and such molecules are well known to have redox-active properties (7Bachur N.R. Gordon S.L. Gee M.V. Cancer Res. 1978; 38: 1745-1750PubMed Google Scholar). Quinones react with flavin-containing reductases and ascorbate to form semiquinone radicals that can in-turn reduce oxygen to form superoxide (O2⨪) (8Dikalov S.I. Rumyantseva G.V. Piskunov A.V. Weiner L.M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 8947-8953Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 9Dikalov S. Alov P. Rangelova D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 195: 113-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Of note, the cytotoxicity of the ansamycin antibiotics has been attributed to radical generation (10Benchekroun N.M. Myers C.E. Sinha B.K. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1994; 17: 191-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Superoxide production by geldanamycin could be particularly important in the interpretation of studies in which it is used to study the function of eNOS. If geldanamycin is releasing either O2⨪ or promoting the release of this radical, physiological responses to endogenously produced NO⋅ may be lost because of the rapid reaction between NO⋅ and O2⨪ (11Huie R.E. Padmaja S. Free Radical Res. Commun. 1993; 18: 195-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (2002) Google Scholar) rather than by specific inhibition of Hsp90. For example, it is well established that O2⨪-producing agents such as pyrogallol cause a dramatic impairment of NO-mediated vasodilation (12Ignarro L.J. Byrns R.E. Buga G.M. Wood K.S. Chaudhuri G. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1988; 244: 181-189PubMed Google Scholar, 13Abrahamsson T. Brandt U. Marklund S.L. Sjoqvist P.O. Circ. Res. 1992; 70: 264-271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we employed electron spin resonance (ESR) to examine the production of O2⨪ induced by geldanamycin and studied its effect on the bioavailability of NO. Our findings demonstrate that concentrations of this drug commonly employed in physiological studies produce large amounts of O2⨪ both in physiological buffers and when exposed to endothelial or smooth muscle cells. These results raise concerns regarding the use of this agent as a specific inhibitor of Hsp90 and raise questions regarding its use as a therapeutic agent. Geldanamycin was obtained from Calbiochem and dissolved in Me2SO. Dihydroethidium was purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, Oregon). Medium 199 was obtained from Fisher. The spin-trap 5-(diethoxyphosphoryl)-5-methyl-1-pyrrolineN-oxide (DEPMPO) was obtained from OXIS (Portland, OR) and stored at −70 °C. Polyethylene glycol-conjugated superoxide dismutase (PEG-SOD) and diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA) were obtained from Sigma. Cyclic hydroxylamine 1-hydroxy-3-carboxyl-2,2,5,-tetramethyl-pyrrolidine hydrochloride (CPH) and NO donor 3-bromo-3,4,4-trimethyl-3,4-dihydrodiazete 1,2-dioxide (DD) were obtained from Alexis Corporation (Läufelfingen, Switzerland). All other reagents were obtained from Sigma. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were cultured in medium 199 supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum, heparin (16 units/ml), endothelial growth supplement (50 μg/ml), glutamine (2 mm), penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). Cells were used up to passage 3, and experiments were performed when cells had reached 90–100% confluency. Smooth muscle cells (SMCs) were isolated from rat aortas by enzymatic digestion as described previously (26Bender A.T. Silverstein A.M. Demady D.R. Kanelakis K.C. Noguchi S. Pratt W.B. Osawa Y. J.

Cells were grown in culture medium with 4.5 g/liter glucose supplemented with 10% calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 mg/ml streptomycin and passaged twice a week. Cells between passages 8 and 20 were used in experiments. To determine intracellular O2⨪ in intact HUVECs, we used dihydroethidium, a cell-permeant dye that is oxidized by O2⨪, to yield fluorescent ethidium bromide that intercalates with nuclear DNA (14Rothe G. Valet G. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1990; 47: 440-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar, 15Miller F.J., Jr. Gutterman D.D. Rios C.D. Heistad D.D. Davidson B.L. Circ.

Leukocyte Biol. 1994; 55: 253-258Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated with 10 μmol/liter dihydroethidium in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, in a light-protected environment at 37 °C. After 30 min, fluorescent confocal microscopic images were obtained using identical acquisition parameters. As a second approach to detect O2⨪, ESR was employed using the spin-trap DEPMPO. Cells were rinsed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and scraped from the plate. After centrifugation at 1800 rpm (7 min), the cells were resuspended in 500 μl of phosphate-buffered saline buffer and kept on ice. The bioavailability of NO⋅generated by 3,4-dihydrodiazete 1,2-dioxide in smooth muscle cells was measured by the iron-dithiocarbomate method as described previously (13Abrahamsson T. Brandt U. Marklund S.L. Sjoqvist P.O. Circ. Res. 1992; 70: 264-271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Fe(DETC)2 can trap NO⋅, thus producing the complex NO·Fe(DETC)2, which has a specific ESR spectrum (13Abrahamsson T. Brandt U. Marklund S.L. Sjoqvist P.O. Circ. Res. 1992; 70: 264-271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Confluent SMCs grown in 100-mm dish washed in Krebs-Henseleit·HEPES buffer were incubated with 50 μmNO⋅ donor and 0.5 mm Fe(DETC)2 prepared separately by the mixing of anaerobic solutions of 4 mmDETC and 2 mm FeSO4. After 30-min incubation at 37 °C, SMCs were resuspended in the incubation medium and frozen in 1-ml syringe using liquid nitrogen. ESR spectra of the NO·Fe(DETC)2 complex were recorded using Dewar flasks with liquid nitrogen. All ESR samples were prepared using 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, with 0.9% NaCl and were placed in 50-μl glass capillaries (Corning, New York, NY). To inhibit iron-catalyzed reactions, DTPA (200 μm) was added to all samples. ESR spectra were recorded using a EMX ESR spectrometer (Bruker Biospin Corp., Billerica, MA) and a super high Q microwave cavity. The ESR settings for experiments with the spin-trap DEPMPO were as follows: field sweep, 120 G; microwave frequency, 9.78 GHz; microwave power, 20 milliwatts; modulation amplitude, 1 G; conversion time, 83 ms; time constant, 83 ms; and receiver gain, 1 × 105 (74 decibels) (n = 8 scans). ESR spin-trapping experiments were done at least three times. The ESR settings for experiments with ascorbate and cyclic hydroxylamine CPH were as follows: field sweep, 50 G; microwave frequency, 9.78 GHz; microwave power, 20 milliwatts; modulation amplitude, 2 G; conversion time, 656 ms; time constant, 656 ms; resolution, 512 points; and receiver gain, 1 × 105 (74 decibels). The kinetics were recorded using 1312-ms conversion time and 5248-ms time constant and were recorded monitoring the ESR amplitude of low field component of ESR spectrum of 3-carboxyl-proxyl nitroxide. The ESR settings for the measurements of nitric oxide with Fe(DETC)2 were as follows: field sweep, 160 G; microwave frequency, 9.39 GHz; microwave power, 10 milliwatts; modulation amplitude, 3 G; conversion time, 2621 ms; time constant, 328 ms; and receiver gain, 1 × 104(n = 4 scans). Experimental ESR spectra were analyzed by computer simulation to provide hyperfine-coupling constants of the observed radical adducts. Programs for the simulation of ESR spectra and the spin-trap data base are available online (epr.niehs.nih.gov/). The details of this computer simulation program have been described elsewhere (17Duling D.R. J. Magn. Reson. 1994; 104: 105-110Crossref Scopus (884) Google Scholar). Hyperfine-coupling constants are expressed as an average of ESR parameters obtained from computer simulations using at least three experimental spectra. ESR spectrum of DEPMPO/⋅OOH was simulated as a combination of two diastereomers with nitrogen, and phosphorous and β- and γ-proton hyperfine-coupling constants (a N = 13.08 G,a H β = 11.45 G, a P = 50.37 G, a H γ = 0.72 G;a N = 13.08 G, a H β = 10.27 G, a P = 49.35 G,a H γ = 0.70 G). The ESR spectrum of DEPMPO/⋅OH was also simulated as a combination of two diastereomers with nitrogen, and phosphorous and β-proton hyperfine-coupling constants (a N = 13.98 G,a H β = 13.10 G, a P = 47.64 G; a N = 13.97 G,a H β = 13.05 G, a P = 46.50 G). Previously, it has been found that quinone-containing compounds undergo one-electron reductions by flavin-containing enzymes to form semiquinone radicals, which in turn may rapidly react with oxygen to generate superoxide. To determine whether flavin-containing enzymes can also reduce geldanamycin and produce O2⨪, the NADPH cytochrome P-450 reductase was used as a model flavin-containing enzyme. The ESR spectra of DEPMPO exposed to only geldanamycin (Fig. 2 A) and NADPH (Fig. 2 B) showed a small background signal of DEPMPO/⋅OH, which reflects an impurity of the DEPMPO spin-trap. The addition of NADPH cytochrome P-450 reductase to the sample containing geldanamycin and NADPH caused the formation of strong ESR signal (Fig. 2 C), which was inhibited by either superoxide dismutase (Fig. 2 D) or by DPI, an inhibitor of flavin-containing enzymes (Fig. 2 E). Of note, the ESR signal of the probe without geldanamycin was ∼10-fold smaller (Fig.2 F) than with geldanamycin (Fig. 2 C), confirming redox cycling of geldanamycin with the NADPH cytochrome P-450 reductase. The ESR spectrum of geldanamycin after exposure to the NADPH cytochrome P-450 reductase without the spin-trap revealed an ESR signal compatible with a semiquinone of geldanamycin (Fig. 2 G). This result demonstrates a one-electron reduction of geldanamycin by the NADPH cytochrome P-450 reductase. A computer analysis of geldanamycin-derived DEPMPO radical adducts revealed the presence of two radical adducts (Fig.3). The ESR spectrum of the probe with DEPMPO, geldanamycin, NADPH, and NADPH cytochrome P-450 reductase (Fig.3 A) was simulated as a combination of the DEPMPO/⋅OOH (Fig. 3 C, 67%) and DEPMPO/⋅OH (Fig. 3 D, 24%) radical adducts (Fig. 3 B). This ESR spectrum contained a hidden ESR signal of the semiquinone of geldanamycin as well (Fig.3 E, 9%). The ESR signal of semiquinone was clearly seen in the probe without DEPMPO (Fig. 2 G); however, this signal overlapped with the ESR spectra of the radical adducts in the sample with DEPMPO (Fig. 3, A and E). Taken together, these results indicated that redox cycling of geldanamycin occurs using a model flavin-containing enzyme NADPH cytochrome P-450 reductase by the detection of both the semiquinone of geldanamycin and the superoxide radical. Previously, it has been suggested that geldanamycin may stimulate eNOS production of O2⨪ in endothelial cells by preventing the association of eNOS with Hsp90 (4Pritchard K.A., Jr. Ackerman A.W. Gross E.R. Stepp D.W. Shi Y. Fontana J.T. Baker J.E. Sessa W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17621-17624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). In view of the finding that geldanamycin may undergo redox cycling and the fact that eNOS is only one among many flavin-containing proteins in endothelial cells, we reexamined the role of eNOS in the production of O2⨪in response to this agent. The ESR spectra of DEPMPO with endothelial cells (Fig. 4, A andB) showed only small background DEPMPO/⋅OH signal. The treatment of endothelial cells with geldanamycin led to the formation of strong ESR signal (Fig. 4 C), which consisted of the DEPMPO/⋅OOH (36%), DEPMPO/⋅OH (46%), and DEPMPO/⋅CR3 (18%) radical adducts (Fig.4 D). These ESR signals were inhibited by superoxide dismutase (Fig. 4 E) but not affected by the NOS inhibitor L-NAME (Fig. 4 F). DPI, an inhibitor of flavin enzymes, decreased this ESR signal by 60% (Fig. 4 G). The presence of the DEPMPO/⋅OH radical adduct observed in these experiments probably is because of partial decomposition of DEPMPO/⋅OOH by peroxidases such as glutathione peroxidase as described previously (18Alegria A.E. Samuni A. Mitchell J.B. Riesz P. Russo A. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8653-8658Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar,19Zwicker K. Dikalov S. Matuschka S. Mainka L. Hofmann M. Khramtsov V. Zimmer G. Arzneim. Forsch. 1998; 48: 629-636PubMed Google Scholar). The effect of geldanamycin on endothelial O2⨪ production was also studied by using dihydroethidium staining. Untreated endothelial cells showed only minor DHE staining, and this was slightly increased by L-NAME (Fig. 5, Vehicle). The effect of L-NAME on untreated endothelial cells probably is to be associated with increased oxidation of DHE because of inhibition of NO production and an increase in ambient levels of O2⨪. The treatment of endothelial cells with geldanamycin significantly increased the amount of O2⨪ detected by DHE, and this was not affected by L-NAME (Fig. 5, GM). Based on these results, we concluded that redox cycling of geldanamycin in endothelial cells causes a dramatic increase in superoxide production, which is partially inhibited by DPI but not affected by L-NAME. These data indicate that geldanamycin-stimulated superoxide production in endothelial cells is not the result of eNOS. The above data suggest that eNOS is not a source of O2⨪ production after endothelial cell exposure to geldanamycin, but that redox cycling of this compound with other flavin-containing enzymes is probably an important source. To examine this further, we also studied rat aortic vascular smooth muscle cells that do not contain NOS. Our results with these cells were very similar to that observed with endothelial cells. When vascular smooth muscle cells were exposed to DEPMPO, only a minor background DEPMPO/⋅OH signal was observed (Fig. 6 A). The addition of geldanamycin to vascular smooth muscle cells led to the formation of a strong ESR signal (Fig. 6 B) that consisted of the DEPMPO/⋅OH radical adduct (Fig. 6 C). This ESR signal was inhibited by superoxide dismutase (Fig. 6 D). DPI also decreased this ESR signal by 50% (Fig. 6 F). These experiments in vascular smooth muscle cells prove that geldanamycin does not require eNOS to produce O2⨪ radicals. Taken together, the above studies in cultured cells indicated that geldanamycin induces a strong increase in superoxide production in both vascular smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells that is partially inhibited by DPI. The fact that geldanamycin-induced O2⨪ production in vascular smooth muscle and endothelial cells was only partially inhibited by DPI suggests that the presence of additional pathways for the reduction of geldanamycin is not dependent on flavin-containing enzymes. It has been shown previously that ascorbate can reduce some quinones, thereby stimulating the production of reactive oxygen species (9Dikalov S. Alov P. Rangelova D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 195: 113-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Therefore, we studied the reaction between ascorbate and geldanamycin as another potential source of O2⨪ in intact cells. When ascorbate was added to phosphate buffer alone, a small amount of ascorbate radical was formed, probably because of auto-oxidation of ascorbate mediated by the trace impurities of transition metals in this solution (Fig. 7, A andC). The addition of geldanamycin increased ascorbyl radical formation, which was proportional to the concentration of ascorbate (Fig. 7, B and D). This increase in the ascorbyl radical is clear evidence of a reaction of geldanamycin with ascorbate. However, it does not show the rate of this reaction, because the ascorbyl radical is only intermediate in this reaction. Oxygen consumption can be used to quantify the rate of the reaction of geldanamycin with ascorbate, because it reflects the rate of reduction of geldanamycin. It was found that the addition of geldanamycin to the probe with ascorbate resulted in a rapid consumption of oxygen (Fig. 7,E and F), which was proportional to the concentration of the geldanamycin. The rate constant of the reaction of geldanamycin with ascorbate was estimated to be as high as 2 × 104m−1 sec−1. This rapid oxidation of ascorbate indicates strong oxidant properties of geldanamycin that are not limited by the reaction with ascorbate. Geldanamycin-mediated oxidation of cyclic hydroxylamine CPH to the stable 3-carboxyl-proxyl-nitroxide was used as a model to study the oxidation of low molecular weight compounds with a redox potential similar to ascorbate. It was found that geldanamycin significantly stimulated the oxidation of CPH, which was inhibited by 50% with superoxide dismutase (Fig. 8). This effect of superoxide dismutase confirmed that the geldanamycin semiquinone is initially formed and subsequently reduces oxygen to produce superoxide, which was later trapped by ascorbate or CPH. Taken in concert with our studies of the NADPH cytochrome P-450 reductase and intact vascular cells, these studies with ascorbate and CPH indicate that geldanamycin stimulates O2⨪ production via both non-enzymatic reactions and enzymatic reactions with enzymes containing flavin groups. Superoxide is a very effective scavenger of nitric oxide (11Huie R.E. Padmaja S. Free Radical Res. Commun. 1993; 18: 195-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (2002) Google Scholar), and an increase of superoxide production by geldanamycin could cause inactivation of NO⋅ in either endothelial or smooth muscle cells. The effect of geldanamycin on the bioavailable NO⋅ was therefore studied in smooth muscle cells using NO⋅ donor. Vascular smooth muscle cells were exposed to the NO⋅ donor 3,4-dihydrodiazete 1,2-dioxide, and bioavailable NO⋅ was detected by the NO⋅spin-trap Fe2+(DETC)2 as described previously (20Kleschyov A.L. Mollnau H. Oelze M. Meinertz T. Huang Y. Harrison D.G. Munzel T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 275: 672-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Geldanamycin decreased the bioavailable NO⋅ generated by 3,4-dihydrodiazete 1,2-dioxide in smooth muscle cells by 50% (Fig.9, A and B). The supplementation of smooth muscle cells with PEG-SOD prevented this effect and restored the normal level of NO⋅ (Fig.9 C). Thus, redox cycling of geldanamycin in smooth muscle cells causes inactivation of NO⋅. The protective effect of PEG-SOD supports a crucial role of superoxide production in the effect of geldanamycin on vascular cells. The present experiments demonstrate that geldanamycin in concentrations commonly employed in physiological studies and pharmacologically yields both a semiquinone radical and O2⨪upon exposure to a model flavin-containing enzyme. In addition, geldanamycin markedly increased both endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cell production of O2⨪. Our studies indicate that this effect of geldanamycin is independent of nitric-oxide synthase but probably involves the interaction of this drug with both small molecule reductants and flavin-containing enzymes. Finally, our data suggest that O2⨪ released from geldanamycin rapidly react with NO⋅, reducing its ability to be trapped by Fe2+(DETC)2. In 1994, Whitesell and co-workers (31Whitesell L. Mimnaugh E.G., De Costa B. Myers C.E. Neckers L.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8324-8328Crossref PubMed Scopus (1310) Google Scholar) showed that the only cellular protein that bound to geldanamycin immobilized on agarose beads was Hsp90. Based on analysis of the crystal structure of the Hsp90-geldanamycin interaction, it was subsequently shown that geldanamycin binds to the residues 9–232 of Hsp90 and that this region contains a pocket that probably is involved in ATP binding and conformational regulation of the enzyme. Based on these seminal observations, the assumption has been made that geldanamycin is a specific inhibitor of Hsp90. Our current findings suggest that although Hsp90 may be the only protein to which geldanamycin binds, there may be other effects of the compound based on its ability to generate O2⨪. Because O2⨪ may serve as a precursor to many other reactive oxygen species, this property of geldanamycin may result in a myriad of cellular effects shared by other superoxide-generating molecules including the oxidation of critical thiols in proteins, production of DNA strand breakage, and depletion of cellular antioxidant defenses. Indeed, as early as 1984, Gutteridge (21Gutteridge J.M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1984; 33: 3059-3062Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) showed that Streptonigrin, an ansamycin antibiotic with anaminoquinone group similar to that of geldanamycin, caused deoxyribose degradation and that this involved the formation of a semiquinone and superoxide and subsequently a hydroxyl-like radical (21Gutteridge J.M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1984; 33: 3059-3062Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Our current findings suggest that geldanamycin has properties similar to that of Streptonigrin. Our findings also have implications for studies using geldanamycin as a probe to examine the role of Hsp90 in the modulation of eNOS function. This enzyme produces NO⋅ when activated by binding of the calcium-calmodulin complex that develops in response to elevated cytoplasmic calcium concentrations. During the past few years, it has become apparent that factors other than calcium-calmodulin binding are involved in the activation of eNOS. Recently, it has been reported that various endothelial cell agonists stimulate the association of Hsp90 with eNOS (22Garcia-Cardena G. Fan R. Shah V. Sorrentino R. Cirino G. Papapetropoulos A. Sessa W.C. Nature. 1998; 392: 821-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (850) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that this stimulation promotes the transfer of electrons through the enzyme by folding it into a catalytically active state or by stabilizing eNOS in its dimeric form. Whereas several lines of evidence support the concept that Hsp90 associates with eNOS upon the activation of the enzyme, interpretations of the functional implication of this heterocomplex formation have largely relied on studies using the apparent effect of geldanamycin on physiological responses and the interpretation that such effects are because of inhibition of NO⋅ production (4Pritchard K.A., Jr. Ackerman A.W.

For example, it has been shown that geldanamycin abolishes endothelium-dependent vasodilation in aortas (22Garcia-Cardena G. Fan R. Shah V. Sorrentino R. Cirino G. Papapetropoulos A. Sessa W.C. Nature. 1998; 392: 821-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (850) Google Scholar), mesenteric vessels (23Shah V. Wiest R. Garcia-Cardena G. Cadelina G. Groszmann R.J. Sessa W.C. Am. J.

Blood Flow Metab. 2000; 20: 1563-1570Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In a similar manner, the exposure of cells to geldanamycin resulted in a dramatic decrease of detectable NO⋅ (25Harris M.B., Ju, H. Venema V.J. Blackstone M. Venema R.C. Gen. Pharmacol. 2000; 35: 165-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 26Bender A.T. Silverstein A.M. Demady D.R. Kanelakis K.C. Noguchi S. Pratt W.B. Osawa Y. J. Biol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 32663-32669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Whereas these studies may reflect an effect of geldanamycin on Hsp90, they could as well be interpreted as being the result of enhanced production of O2⨪by the compound, leading to oxidative degradation of NO⋅, and a loss of its bioactivity. Our current findings, which show that geldanamycin diminishes the detectable NO⋅ released by an exogenous NO donor, supports the notion that geldanamycin can affect NO⋅ levels independent of its production by the eNOS enzyme. The nitric-oxide synthases can produce O2⨪ in the absence of the critical cofactor tetrahydrobiopterin or the substratel-arginine (29Xia Y. Tsai A.L. Berka V. Zweier J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25804-25808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar, 30Vasquez-Vivar J. Kalyanaraman B. Martasek P. Hogg N. Masters B.S. Karoui H. Tordo P. Pritchard K.A., Jr. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9220-9225Crossref PubMed Scopus (1213) Google Scholar). This has been shown to be attributed to a critical role of tetrahydrobiopterin in electron transfer from the heme iron of NOS to l-arginine. In the absence of either tetrahydrobiopterin or l-arginine, electrons are transferred to molecular oxygen resulting in the formation of O2⨪. This phenomenon has been referred to as NOS uncoupling. Recently, it has been suggested that Hsp90 plays a role in the folding of eNOS, thus directing electron flow through its oxygenase domain tol-arginine and therefore critical in preventing eNOS uncoupling (4Pritchard K.A., Jr. Ackerman A.W.

In this prior study, the authors showed that geldanamycin increased bovine aortic endothelial cell O2⨪production in response to A23187 and suggested that eNOS was the source of O2⨪, because the NOS inhibitor L-NAME seemed to prevent this effect of geldanamycin. Our current data differ from the results of Pritchard et al. (4Pritchard K.A., Jr. Ackerman A.W. Gross E.R. Stepp D.W. Shi Y. Fontana J.T. Baker J.E. Sessa W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17621-17624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar), because we found that endothelial cell O2⨪ production, as detected by the spin-trap DEPMPO, was increased by geldanamycin and that this was not altered by L-NAME. Furthermore, we found that geldanamycin increased O2⨪in rat aortic vascular smooth muscle cells to a similar extent as observed in endothelial cells. These latter cells do not express eNOS, indicating that the effect of geldanamycin in these cells is independent of eNOS uncoupling. The reasons for the discrepancy between our current study and the study of Pritchard et al. (4Pritchard K.A., Jr. Ackerman A.W. Gross E.R. Stepp D.W. Shi Y. Fontana J.T. Baker J.E. Sessa W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17621-17624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar) remain unclear but may relate to the methodology of detecting O2⨪. The electron spin resonance method we employed is probably the most accurate approach to the detection of O2⨪ of the currently available methods. It is also possible that in this earlier study (4Pritchard K.A., Jr. Ackerman A.W. Gross E.R. Stepp D.W. Shi Y. Fontana J.T. Baker J.E. Sessa W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17621-17624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar), geldanamycin produced a substantial amount of superoxide causing the formation of peroxynitrite. Peroxynitrite could oxidize tetrahydrobiopterin leading to uncoupling of eNOS in an Hsp90-independent fashion. In summary, this study provides evidence that geldanamycin can participate in a redox-cycling reaction that involves reaction with flavin-containing enzymes or small molecule reductants such as ascorbate or the cyclic hydroxylamine CPH. This effect of geldanamycin is independent of its ability to inhibit Hsp90 and suggests that the compound may have many other cellular effects beyond simply preventing the function of this chaperone protein. Our present data indicate that the effects of geldanamycin in studies of nitric oxide physiology be interpreted with prudence, because this molecule not only inhibits Hsp90 and any effect it may have on eNOS but also causes oxidative inactivation of nitric oxide. Finally, the treatment of humans with geldanamycin should be approached with caution given the numerous untoward cellular effects of O2⨪ and reactive oxygen species derived from O2⨪.

Members of the Rho GTPase family regulate cytoskeletal organization by stimulating actin polymerization and stress fiber formation when activated by extracellular signaling (9Ridley A.J. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 389-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3785) Google Scholar). A number of Rho effector molecules, including Rho kinase, mDia, and phosphatidylinositol phosphate 5-kinase, also participate in cytoskeletal organization (10Kaibuchi K. Kuroda S. Amano M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 459-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (883) Google Scholar, 11Maekawa M. Ishizaki T. Boku S. Watanabe N. Fujita A. Iwamatsu A. Obinata T. Ohashi K. Mizuno K. Narumiya S.

Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2295-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (2080) Google Scholar). Recent studies showed that RhoA signaling stimulates the transcriptional activity of serum response factor (SRF)1 through a mechanism mediated by changes in actin dynamics (7Sotiropoulos A. Gineitis D. Copeland J. Treisman R. Cell. 1999; 98: 159-169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar, 15Mack C.P. Somlyo A.V. Hautmann M. Somlyo A.P. Owens G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 341-347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). SRF is a MADS-box transcription factor that regulates serum-inducible and muscle-specific gene expression by binding to a consensus sequence known a CArG box, CC(A/T)6GG (16Treisman R. Nature. 1995; 376: 468-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 17Treisman R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4905-4913Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Members of the myocyte enhancer factor-2 family of MADS-box transcription factors, which regulate muscle cell differentiation (18Black B.L. Olson E.N. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 167-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar), are also stimulated by RhoA signaling (19Marinissen M.J. Chiariello M. Gutkind J.S. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 535-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Consistent with a role in the activation of SRF and myocyte enhancer factor-2 transcription factors, Rho signaling has been shown to be required for muscle cell differentiation (20Takano H. Komuro I. Oka T. Shiojima I. Hiroi Y. Mizuno T. Yazaki Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1580-1589Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Rho signaling has also been shown to activate members of the GATA family of transcription factors during cardiomyocyte hypertrophy (21Yanazume T. Hasegawa K. Wada H. Morimoto T. Abe M. Kawamura T. Sasayama S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 277: 8618-8625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In light of the requirement of Rho signaling during muscle cell differentiation and hypertrophy, it is tempting to speculate as to the existence of muscle-specific regulators of Rho signaling. Here, we describe a novel actin-binding protein, striated muscle activator of Rho signaling (STARS), identified in a differential cDNA screen for unknown genes expressed in the early embryonic heart. STARS is associated with the I-band of the sarcomere and with actin stress fibers in transfected cells. STARS contains a unique, evolutionarily conserved domain that stimulates SRF-dependent transcription through a mechanism that requires actin polymerization and Rho GTPase activation. These findings suggest that STARS acts as a muscle-specific transducer of cytoskeletal signals that stimulate Rho signaling, thereby activating SRF-dependent transcription. For subtractive screening by representational difference analysis, hearts and the region of the embryo dorsal to the heart, including the neural fold and the first three somites, were dissected from embryonic day (E)-8.25 mouse embryos. Total RNA was isolated from the heart and the dorsal embryonic region using TRIZOL (Invitrogen). mRNA was purified using a mRNA purification kit (Amersham Biosciences) and converted into double-strand cDNA by the Superscript choice system for cDNA synthesis (Invitrogen). For subtraction screening between heart (Tester) and other embryonic parts (Driver), we employed the representational difference analysis method described by Hubank and Schatz (22Hubank M. Schatz D.G. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 303: 325-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cDNA from both tissues was digested withDpnII and ligated with an R-linker (the annealed oligonucleotides were R-Bgl-12 (5′-GATCTGCGGTGA-3′) and R-Bgl-24 (5′-AGCACTCTCCAGCCTCTCACCGCA-3′)). Using R-Bgl-24 as primer, cDNA was amplified by PCR and digested with DpnII again. cDNA from the heart was purified by gel extraction and ligated with a J-linker (the annealed oligonucleotides were J-Bgl-12 (5′-GATCTGTTCATG-3′) and J-Bgl-24 (5′-ACCGACGTCGACTATCCATGAACA-3′)). Tester ligated with J-linker and Driver cDNAs (ratio 1:100) were hybridized at 67 °C for 20 h. PCR reactions were then performed by primer J-Bgl-24 to yield a PCR product referred to as DPI (differential product). DPI was digested with DpnII as a new tester and ligated with N-linker (the annealed oligonucleotides were N-Bgl-12 (5′-GATCTTTCCATCG-3′) andN-Bgl-24 (5′-AGGCAACTGTGCTATCCGAGGGAA-3′)).N-Linker-ligated DPI was hybridized with Driver (ratio 1:800) and amplified by PCR two times usingN-oligonucleotides as primer. Linkers for tester were replaced with J-oligonucleotides in the third round andN-oligonucleotides in the fourth round of hybridization. The final PCR products, referred to as DPIV, were cloned into the TA cloning vector (pGEMT-easy, Promega), and inserted DPIV fragments were amplified by PCR using N-Bgl-24 as primers to make two identical dot blots. One dot blot was hybridized with tester probe, and the other was hybridized with driver probe to confirm the differential expression of DPIV fragments. To obtain a full-length STARS cDNA, an E10.5 mouse heart cDNA library (Stratagene) was screened using a 342-bp cDNA fragment isolated by representational difference analysis. The longest positive clone contained a 375-amino acid open reading frame without a stop codon 5′ of the first methionine in the sequence. To further obtain 5′ sequences, adult mouse heart and skeletal muscle cDNA libraries (CLONTECH) were screened with a 400-bp cDNA fragment from the 5′ end of the longest cDNA as a probe. 5′-Rapid amplification of cDNA ends (5′-RACE) was also performed using the SMART 5′-RACE kit (CLONTECH) and the RLM first choice 5′-RACE kit (Ambion) following the manufacturer's instructions. 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends was performed with mRNA from human skeletal muscle (CLONTECH) and from mouse heart and skeletal muscle. There were no stop codons upstream of the first methionine. Northern blot analysis was performed using mouse and human multiple tissue Northern blots (CLONTECH). 32P-Labeled probes were prepared from a full-length mouse STARS cDNA and a partial human cDNA. Hybridizations were performed in Quick-Hyb (CLONTECH). RNA probes corresponding to the sense and the antisense strands of the STARS cDNA were prepared. In situ hybridization was performed on sagittal sections of mouse embryos as described (23Benjamin I.J. Shelton J. Garry D.J. Richardson J.A. Dev. Dyn. 1997; 208: 75-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). STARS expression constructs were generated using the pcDNA3.1 mammalian expression vector (Invitrogen), which was modified to contain an amino-terminal Myc tag. Constitutively active RhoA (L63) and C3 transferase in Prk5 were generously provided by Dr. Alan Hall (University College, London, UK). The SM22-luciferase reporter contained the 1343-bp promoter (24Li L. Miano J.M. Mercer B. Olson E.N. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). The smooth muscle α-actin-luciferase reporter contained 1 kb of promoter region, the first untranslated exon, and the first intron ligated into the pBL3basic vector (Promega). The 4xcfos reporter contained four tandem copies of the c-fos CArG box with flanking sequences as described (25Chang P.S., Li, L. McAnally J. Olson E.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17206-17212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). CMV-lacZ (Promega) was used as an internal control for transfection efficiency. Neonatal rat cardiomyocytes were isolated as described previously (26Nicol R.L. Frey N. Pearson G. Cobb M. Richardson J. Olson E.N. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2757-2767Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). COS cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. Eighteen hours after plating, medium was changed to serum-free medium, and transfections were performed at 50% confluence using FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) following the manufacturer's instructions. Each transfection used 0.15 μg of plasmid DNA for the reporter assays and 0.5–1 μg for immunohistochemistry. Cytochalasin D 2 μm (Sigma-Aldrich), and Y-27632 75 μm(Tocris) were added directly just after transfection. Latrunculin B (0.5 μm; dissolved in 10% ethanol, Calbiochem) was added 12 h after transfection, and 10% ethanol (final concentration 0.01%) was added to control wells. Cells were harvested 36 h after transfection, and luciferase and β-galactosidase activity were measured. All transfection assays were performed at least three times with duplicates for each assay. For immunofluorescence, cells were rinsed with PBS, incubated in 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min on ice, and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min on ice. For rat neonatal cardiomyocytes, 1% Triton X-100 in PBS was used. Cells were blocked for 30 min at room temperature in 2.5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS for COS cells and in 1% BSA plus 3% goat serum in PBS for rat cardiomyocytes. Then, cells were incubated with first antibody diluted in 0.5% BSA in PBS for 30–60 min at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C. Anti c-Myc monoclonal antibody 9E10 (Santa Cruz) was used at a 1:200 dilution. Other antibodies were anti-STARS antibody (1:50), α-actinin monoclonal antibody (1:400; Sigma-Aldrich), α-tubulin antibody (1:2000; Sigma-Aldrich), and vimentin antibody (1:500; Sigma-Aldrich). Secondary antibodies were anti-mouse/rabbit IgG fluorescein isothiocyanate or Texas Red (Vector) used at a 1:200 dilution incubated with or without phalloidin-TRITC (1:500; Sigma Aldrich). Immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis was performed as described previously (27Lu J. McKinsey T.A. Zhang C.L. Olson E.N. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 233-244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). For immunoprecipitation, cells were incubated with 1 μg of anti-c-Myc polyclonal antibody A14 (Santa Cruz). Western blots were performed with anti-actin monoclonal antibody C4 (1:100; Chemicon) or anti-c-Myc monoclonal antibody 9E10 (1:1000; Santa Cruz) followed by incubation with secondary antibody horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti mouse-IgG (Santa Cruz). To detect signals, blots were incubated with Transluminol (Santa Cruz) for 1 min and exposed to film (Eastman Kodak Co.). A cDNA encoding the full-length STARS open reading frame was cloned in-frame into vector pGEXKG (28Guan K.L. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 192: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1635) Google Scholar). BL21-DE3 cells containing the GST fusion expression plasmid were grown to an optical density of 0.5 and induced with 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 3 h at 37 °C. GST-STARS was purified by GST affinity chromatography using standard techniques. Purified actin and actinin were purchased from Cytoskeleton, Inc. BSA was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Actin sedimentation assays were performed as recommended by Cytoskeleton, Inc. Supernatants and pellets were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. Rabbit immunization was conducted by Cocalico Biologicals using the full-length STARS protein fused to GST. For immunostaining and Western blots, IgG was purified from antisera with protein A-Sepharose beads (Zymed Laboratories, Inc.). We performed a differential cDNA screen for novel genes expressed in the mouse heart tube at E8.25 but not in other regions of the E8.25 embryo (see “Materials and Methods”). Positive clones representing potential heart tube-specific genes were used for whole-mount in situhybridization to confirm their cardiac specificity. One of the cardiac-specific cDNAs isolated in the screen encoded a novel 375-amino acid protein that we refer to as striated muscleactivator of Rho signaling (STARS), because it is expressed specifically in striated muscle where it binds actin and activates Rho GTPase (see below). The predicted open reading frame of STARS did not contain recognizable protein motifs. Data base searches for related genes revealed an apparent human ortholog encoded by a gene located on chromosome 8q23. A partial cDNA encoding a STARS-like protein was also identified in the zebrafish Expressed Sequence Tag data base (accession number AI721847) (Fig. 1). No other related genes were identified in the searches of the mouse and human genome sequences. Genomic sequences with the potential to encode proteins with high homology to the carboxyl-terminal 142 amino acids of STARS were also identified in Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster (accession numbers F36F2.1 and T04A8.4, respectively) (Fig. 1). Consistent with the cDNA subtraction scheme, STARS transcripts were detected by in situ hybridization specifically in the primitive heart tube at E8.75 (Fig.2 A). Thereafter, STARS expression was maintained in the heart and was also detected in skeletal muscle after E10.5 (data not shown). Northern analysis of adult tissues revealed three STARS transcripts in mouse heart and skeletal muscle and two transcripts in these human tissues (Fig.2 B). Sequencing of multiple independent cDNAs revealed only a single open reading frame with no evidence for alternative splicing within the protein-coding region. Therefore, we believe the multiple transcripts reflect the presence of different 3′-untranslated sequences. Western blot analysis of adult mouse heart extracts with an anti-STARS antibody revealed a single species of 45 kDa, similar to the predicted size of STARS (Fig.3 A). This band comigrated with a Myc-tagged STARS protein expressed in transfected COS cells. To determine the subcellular distribution of STARS, rat primary cardiomyocytes were immunostained with the STARS antibody (Fig.3 B, a and d). STARS staining showed a periodicity reminiscent of sarcomeric localization. The sarcomeric localization of STARS abuts the Z-line on both sides, as demonstrated by a partial overlap with α-actinin (Fig. 3 B, band c, e and f). This periodicity demonstrates that STARS is localized to the I-band of the sarcomere. In addition to I-band localization, a portion of STARS localizes to sarcomeric structures between Z-lines (Fig. 3 B, cand f). A schematic of STARS localization is depicted in Fig. 3 C. We also examined the subcellular localization of a Myc-tagged STARS protein in transiently transfected COS cells. STARS colocalized with actin, which is marked by phalloidin staining (Fig.4 A, a–f). Interestingly, in a small percentage of cells, STARS was localized to the nucleus (data not shown). To determine whether a GST-STARS fusion protein was able to bind actin, we performed in vitro actin sedimentation assays. In the absence of actin, GST-STARS was predominantly contained in the supernatant after centrifugation (Fig. 4 B, lanes 1 and 2). However, in the presence of actin, GST-STARS was present almost exclusively in the actin pellet (lanes 3and 4). As a positive control, purified actinin was used and, as expected, was contained almost exclusively in the actin pellet (lanes 5 and 6). In contrast, BSA failed to co-sediment with actin under these conditions. These results demonstrate that STARS directly associates with actin and appears to enhance actin polymerization and/or stabilize polymerized actin (compare lanes 3 and 4 to lanes 7 and8). To map the actin binding region of STARS, co-immunoprecipitation experiments were performed in COS cells transiently transfected with Myc-tagged STARS deletion mutants (schematized in Fig.5 A). As shown in Fig.5 B, the wild-type protein and the conserved carboxyl-terminal 142 amino acids (mutant C142) were able to co-immunoprecipitate with actin. A further amino-terminal deletion to amino acid 279 (mutant C96) abolished actin binding. Deletions that removed the carboxyl-terminal portion of STARS also did not bind actin (mutants N346, N323, N304, N279, N233, N100, and N101–233). Similarly, an internal deletion mutant (Del 234–279) failed to co-immunoprecipitate with actin. These results revealed that binding of STARS to actin requires two separate but co-dependent regions encompassed by amino acids 234–279 and 346–375. Recent studies show that stabilization of the actin cytoskeleton stimulates the transcriptional activity of SRF (7Sotiropoulos A. Gineitis D. Copeland J. Treisman R. Cell. 1999; 98: 159-169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar, 15Mack C.P. Somlyo A.V. Hautmann M. Somlyo A.P. Owens G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 341-347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). To examine whether STARS might participate in a signaling pathway between the cytoskeleton and the nucleus, we tested whether the promoter of theSM22 gene, which is regulated by SRF in muscle cells (29Li L. Liu Z. Mercer B. Overbeek P. Olson E.N. Dev. Biol. 1997; 187: 311-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar,30Kim S., Ip, H.S., Lu, M.M. Clendenin C. Parmacek M.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2266-2278Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), was responsive to STARS. Remarkably, STARS stimulated the expression of an SM22-luciferase reporter by 40-fold in transiently transfected COS cells (Fig.6 A). Mutation of the CArG boxes in the SM22 promoter abolished responsiveness to STARS, demonstrating the involvement of SRF in this response. Stimulation of SRF activity is not a general property of actin-binding proteins, as α-actinin has no effect on SRF activity (data not shown). STARS also weakly stimulated the α-smooth muscle actin promoter, which is regulated by SRF (31Mack C.P. Owens G.K. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 852-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), and it activated anE1b promoter linked to four tandem copies of the CArG box and flanking sequences from the c-fos promoter (Fig.6 B). Comparisons of the complete set of STARS deletion mutants showed a direct correlation between the ability to bind actin and to stimulateSM22 transcription (Figs. 5 and 6 C). The conserved carboxyl-terminal region of STARS was necessary and sufficient to stimulate SRF activity, as demonstrated by the finding that mutant C142 was as effective as the full-length protein in activating SM22-luciferase. To examine whether STARS stimulates SRF activity via its effects on actin dynamics, we treated COS cells with cytochalasin D (CD), which prevents actin polymerization (32Sampath P. Pollard T. Biochemistry (Mosc.). 1991; 30: 1973-1980Crossref Scopus (277) Google Scholar), and latrunculin B (LB), which sequesters monomeric actin (33Morton W.M. Ayscough K.R. McLaughlin P.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 376-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). In STARS-transfected cells, only short fragments of disrupted stress fibers were observed in the presence of 2 μm CD or 0.5 μm LB (data not shown). STARS activated SM22-luciferase ∼40-fold (Fig.6 D). In the absence of STARS, CD itself increasedSM22 promoter activity by 8-fold, consistent with previous results (7Sotiropoulos A. Gineitis D. Copeland J. Treisman R. Cell. 1999; 98: 159-169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar, 15Mack C.P. Somlyo A.V. Hautmann M. Somlyo A.P. Owens G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 341-347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). However, CD inhibited STARS-mediated activation by 55% (40- versus 18-fold). LB treatment abolishedSM22-luciferase activity in cells transfected with STARS (Fig. 6 D). These findings suggested that transcriptional activation by STARS is mediated in large part by the actin cytoskeleton. The opposing effects of CD and LB are likely to reflect their differential effects on the pool of G-actin; whereas CD dimerizes G-actin (34Goddette D.W. Frieden C. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15970-15973Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), LB sequesters G-actin monomers (33Morton W.M. Ayscough K.R. McLaughlin P.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 376-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). In light of the ability of RhoA to stimulate SRF activity by promoting actin polymerization (7Sotiropoulos A. Gineitis D. Copeland J. Treisman R. Cell. 1999; 98: 159-169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar, 15Mack C.P. Somlyo A.V. Hautmann M. Somlyo A.P. Owens G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 341-347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar), we compared the effects of a constitutively active RhoA mutant (L63) and STARS on SM22promoter activity. As shown in Fig. 6 E, STARS and RhoA L63 activated the SM22 promoter to comparable levels and together stimulated activity to higher levels. Rho signaling is inhibited by the Rho kinase inhibitor Y-27632, which prevents stress fiber formation (11Maekawa M. Ishizaki T. Boku S. Watanabe N. Fujita A. Iwamatsu A. Obinata T. Ohashi K. Mizuno K. Narumiya S. Science. 1999; 285: 895-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (1257) Google Scholar), and C3 transferase, which specifically ADP-ribosylates RhoA (35Nemoto Y. Namba T. Teru-uchi T. Ushikubi F. Morii N. Narumiya S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20916-20920Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Treatment of COS cells with Y-27632 (75 μm) or transfection with a C3 transferase expression plasmid reduced the stimulatory activity of STARS on theSM22 promoter by 55 and 88%, respectively (Fig.6 F). Together, these results suggest that STARS activation of transcription is mediated at least in part by a Rho-dependent mechanism. STARS is a novel and evolutionarily conserved actin-binding protein expressed specifically in striated muscle. STARS localizes to the sarcomere of cardiomyocytes and to actin stress fibers in transfected cells. Stabilization of the actin cytoskeleton by STARS stimulates SRF-dependent transcription through a mechanism that involves RhoA signaling. STARS contains no recognizable protein motifs and represents a new type of sarcomeric actin-binding protein. Deletion mutants of STARS indicate that there are two separate regions that work in concert to bind actin. The high conservation of the actin binding regions between vertebrate and invertebrate STARS proteins suggests that this activity has been evolutionarily conserved. It should also be noted that STARS associates with the actin cytoskeleton in transfected cells but is restricted predominantly to the I-band in striated muscle. This raises the possibility that muscle-specific proteins serve to localize STARS to the I-band. STARS also partially overlaps the Z-line, suggesting the potential involvement of one or more Z-line proteins in restricting its distribution. STARS expression is initiated in cardiac and skeletal muscle during the period of myofibrillogenesis when the myofibrillar components become assembled into the functional sarcomere (36Ehler E. Rothen B.M. Hammerle S.P. Komiyama M. Perriard J.C. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1529-1539Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 37Gregorio C.C. Antin P.B. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 355-362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Considering the timing of its expression and its actin binding properties, it is tempting to speculate that STARS may participate in sarcomere assembly by inducing actin polymerization and cross-linking during striated muscle development. Increased expression of STARS during myogenesis may enhance Rho signaling, which has been shown to be required for muscle differentiation (38Wei L. Zhou W. Croissant J.D. Johansen F.E. Prywes R. Balasubramanyam A. Schwartz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30287-30294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Consistent with recent studies implicating actin dynamics in the control of SRF-dependent transcription (7Sotiropoulos A. Gineitis D. Copeland J. Treisman R. Cell. 1999; 98: 159-169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar, 15Mack C.P. Somlyo A.V. Hautmann M. Somlyo A.P. Owens G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 341-347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar, 39Wei L. Wang L. Carson J.A. Agan J.E. Imanaka-Yoshida K. Schwartz R.J. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 785-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), STARS stimulates the activity of SRF. The conserved carboxyl-terminal region of STARS is both necessary and sufficient for SRF activation and actin binding; the correlation between these activities argues that the effects of STARS on SRF are coupled to its effects on the cytoskeleton. Stimulation of SRF activity is observed with native muscle promoters as well as with an artificial promoter containing multimers of CArG boxes. Thus, we conclude that the transcription-enhancing properties of STARS are directed specifically at SRF rather than another transcription factor that cooperates with SRF. What is the mechanism for activation of SRF by STARS? A working model of a potential mechanism of action of STARS within the context of the regulation of actin dynamics is shown in Fig.7. Actin treadmilling determines the relative distribution of the monomeric G-actin and polymerized F-actin states. Previous studies suggested that G-actin suppresses the activity of SRF (7Sotiropoulos A. Gineitis D. Copeland J. Treisman R. Cell. 1999; 98: 159-169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). Our results suggest that STARS activates SRF by relieving this repressive influence (as a result of its ability to stimulate actin polymerization) and thereby reduce the G-actin pool. Such a mechanism would account for the ability of latrunculin B, which sequesters G-actin monomers (33Morton W.M. Ayscough K.R. McLaughlin P.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 376-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar), to interfere with the activity of STARS. Although polymerization of actin by STARS appears to be coupled to SRF activation, stimulation of actin polymerization per se is not sufficient to account for the effects of STARS on SRF activity; this is because STARS is able to increase SRF activity in the presence of cytochalasin D, which prevents actin polymerization by binding to the plus-end of F-actin, where it blocks further addition of actin subunits. Cytochalasin D also stimulates SRF activity alone, presumably by reducing the level of free G-actin monomers (7Sotiropoulos A. Gineitis D. Copeland J. Treisman R. Cell. 1999; 98: 159-169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar, 15Mack C.P. Somlyo A.V. Hautmann M. Somlyo A.P. Owens G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 341-347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Perhaps STARS acts through a similar mechanism. In principle, G-actin could inhibit SRF directly, or it could sequester cofactors required for SRF activation (7Sotiropoulos A. Gineitis D. Copeland J. Treisman R. Cell. 1999; 98: 159-169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). In light of the actin binding properties of STARS, it may stimulate SRF by acting as a sink to sequester G-actin and, thereby, relieve repression on SRF. It is intriguing to note that G-actin has been shown to shuttle to the nucleus (40Wada A. Fukuda M. Mishima M. Nishida E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1635-1641Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar) and also to be contained within the SWI-SNF chromatin remodeling complex (40Wada A. Fukuda M. Mishima M. Nishida E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1635-1641Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 41Zhao K. Wang W. Rando O.J. Xue Y. Swiderek K. Kuo A. Crabtree G.R.

Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 92-97Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Whether STARS might alter the incorporation of actin into this complex is an interesting possibility. SRF activates muscle-specific transcription by recruiting myogenic transcription factors such as GATA4, Nkx2.5, and myocardin (42Chen C.Y. Schwartz R.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 16: 6372-6384Crossref Google Scholar, 43Belaguli N.S. Sepulveda J.L. Nigam V. Charron F. Nemer M. Schwartz R.J. Mol. Cell.

Although STARS is a muscle-specific protein, its ability to stimulate SRF activity in nonmuscle cells indicates that it does not require these myogenic transcription factors for activity. The up-regulation of STARS expression after the onset of myocyte differentiation provides a mechanism for enhancing SRF activity in differentiated muscle cells and reinforcing the expression of SRF-dependent sarcomeric genes. Rho signaling promotes the formation of F-actin and depletes the G-actin pool (Fig. 7). Sotiropouloset al. (7Sotiropoulos A. Gineitis D. Copeland J. Treisman R. Cell. 1999; 98: 159-169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar) conclude that the effects of Rho on SRF are secondary to its effects on the cytoskeleton and are mediated by a decrease in G-actin as a result of actin polymerization. Stimulation of SRF activity by STARS is influenced by Rho signaling, since the Rho inhibitor C3 transferase reduces SRF activation by STARS. The ability of the Rho kinase inhibitor Y-27632 to diminish SRF activation by STARS also implicates Rho kinase as a downstream effector of STARS. However, the finding that Y-27632 only partially inhibited STARS activity also suggests the involvement of other Rho effectors in the mechanism for STARS action. Rho GTPases act as molecular switches that cycle between inactive (GDP-bound) and active (GTP-bound) conformations. Guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) activate Rho GTPases by accelerating GDP/GTP exchange, whereas GTPase-activating proteins stimulate GTP hydrolysis (14Van Aelst L. D'Souza-Schorey C. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2295-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (2080) Google Scholar). Although STARS acts at least in part via a RhoA-dependent signaling pathway, STARS does not show sequence homology with GEFs nor does it contain a nucleotide binding domain, suggesting that it does not act directly on Rho A. Intriguingly, however, a novel GEF, called p63RhoGEF, was recently shown to associate with the I-band of the sarcomere and to stimulate RhoA activity (46Souchet M. Portales-Casamar E. Mazurais D. Schmidt S. Leger I. Javre J.-L. Robert P. Berrebi-Bertrand I. Bril A. Gout B. Debant A. Calmels T.P.G. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 629-640Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The colocalization of p63RhoGEF and STARS and the involvement of both proteins in Rho activation raises the interesting possibility that these proteins may interact or that STARS may influence p63RhoGEF activity. Rho signaling plays an important role in muscle gene expression and myogenesis. Previous studies have shown that RhoA activates SRF-dependent transcription, thereby up-regulating MyoD and triggering the differentiation cascade (47Carnac G. Primig M. Kitzmann M. Chafey P. Tuil D. Lamb N. Fernandez A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1891-1902Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Activation of RhoA by Gq-coupled receptor agonists also induces premyofibrils, myofibril organization, and atrial natriuretic factor expression in primary cardiomyocytes (48Thorburn J., Xu, S. Thorburn A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1888-1900Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 49Aoki H. Izumo S. Sadoshima J. Circ.

Chem. 1998; 273: 7725-7730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Of course, stimulation of SRF activity by RhoA does not require STARS, since Rho can activate SRF in nonmuscle cells in which STARS is not expressed. Although it is formally possible that RhoA acts in parallel to STARS and that the action of RhoA on the cytoskeleton promotes STARS-induced gene expression rather than acting as a downstream effector for STARS, we feel this is less likely because STARS can activate SRF in serum-starved fibroblasts 2A. Arai, J. Spencer, and E. N. Olson, unpublished results. in which RhoA does not induce actin bundling (51Hill C.S. Cell. 1995; 81: 1159-1170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1197) Google Scholar). STARS expression is maintained in adult cardiac and skeletal muscle and is dramatically up-regulated during hypertrophic growth of the heart in response to calcineurin activation as well as pressure-overload,2 which is associated with calcineurin activation (52Leinwand L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 13: 2947-2949Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Sarcomere organization is a hallmark of cardiac hypertrophy. During hypertrophic growth of cardiomyocytes, STARS might organize new myofibrils, whereas extreme overexpression might result in disorganization of actin bundles with resulting cardiac dysfunction, as observed in failing hearts. The integrity of the cytoskeleton and sarcomere has a profound influence on gene expression and growth of muscle cells. The ability of STARS to activate Rho signaling through actin association may provide a potential link between myocyte structure and the program for muscle gene expression. In light of the critical role of Rho signaling in mechanical stress-induced hypertrophy (53Aikawa R. Komuro I. Yamazaki T. Zou Y. Kudoh S. Zhu W. Kadowaki T. Yazaki Y. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 458-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) and the function of the Z-line in mechanosignaling (54Chien K.R. Nature. 2001; 407: 227-232Crossref Scopus (164) Google Scholar), the potential involvement of STARS in mechanical signaling during development and disease of striated muscle cells is an especially interesting issue for the future.

FEBS Lett. 2000; 476: 32-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) of glycoproteins in the secretory pathway. During their passage through the Golgi apparatus, the oligomannose-type sugar units attached to glycoproteins are often partially demannosylated and subsequently decorated with GlcNAc, galactose, sialic acid, and fucose residues (2Kornfeld R. Kornfeld S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 631-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (3752) Google Scholar). The resulting glycoproteins, bearing complex-type oligosaccharide, are subsequently secreted into the extracellular space or exported to the cell surface where they are involved in diverse regulatory processes (8Varki A. Glycobiology. 1993; 3: 97-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (4963) Google Scholar). The importance of this widespread cotranslational modification is attested to by the identification of a rapidly growing number of diseases whose molecular origins have been linked to abnormalities in glycoprotein biosynthesis (9Aebi M.

Although the molecular events leading to this complicated clinical picture are multifactorial and not well understood, the disease is characterized at the biochemical level by under-glycosylated serum glycoproteins of hepatic origin (16Seta N. Barnier A. Hochedez F. Besnard M.A. Durand G. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1996; 254: 131-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Disruption of any one of the enzymic steps involved in the biosynthesis of lipid-linked oligosaccharides (LLO) and the transfer of the mature oligosaccharide onto protein could potentially lead to the glycoprotein hypoglycosylation that is considered to be the hallmark of CDG I. Work on the underlying genetic bases of CDG I is still at an early stage because genes encoding the proteins involved in glycoprotein biosynthesis are numerous and, at least in humans, have for the most part yet to be identified (9Aebi M. Hennet T. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 136-141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Notwithstanding these difficulties, mutations in six of the genes encoding proteins of the glycosylation pathway have been shown to underlie CDG I, and these disease types have been classified as CDG I subtypes a–f as follows: (Ia, phosphomannomutase 2 (17Matthijs G.

Identification of the molecular bases of type I CDG is crucial from the clinical standpoint in that CDG Ib is treatable by administering oral mannose to the patient (29Freeze H.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 255: 189-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In addition, identification of the underlying genetic defects will ultimately facilitate the design of antenatal diagnostic tests for different disease subtypes.Here we report on the genetic deficit underlying a new subtype of CDG I. We show that skin biopsy fibroblasts from a CDG I patient have a reduced capacity to add the eighth mannose residue onto the dolichol-PP-oligosaccharide precursor required for protein glycosylation. Sequencing of cDNA derived from the patient and control cells indicated that the patient was homozygous for a point (F142V) mutation in the human homolog of the yeast ALG12gene that encodes dolichyl-P-Man:Man7GlcNAc2-PP-dolichyl α6-mannosyltransferase.DISCUSSIONHere we report on a CDG I patient with a deficiency in the ability to add the eighth mannose onto LLO. Structural analysis of the lipid-linked Man7GlcNAc2 that was found to accumulate in fibroblasts from this patient revealed the same isomeric configuration of mannose residues to that which has been shown to occur in the normal LLO intermediate generated during glycoprotein biosynthesis (2Kornfeld R. Kornfeld S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 631-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (3752) Google Scholar, 46Romero P. Herscovics A. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15936-15940Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This result allowed us to eliminate the hypothesis that the block was due to a rare “change of function” mutation potentially causing the seventh mannose residue to be added to an inappropriate position of the LLO acceptor. Additionally, it is noteworthy that in a yeast strain deficient in ALG11p, the enzyme that adds the fifth mannose to the growing oligosaccharide-lipid (50Cipollo J.F. Trimble R.B. Chi J.H. Yan Q. Dean N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21828-21840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), an abnormal Man7GlcNAc2 structure linked to dolichol has been observed (50Cipollo J.F. Trimble R.B. Chi J.H. Yan Q. Dean N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21828-21840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) further emphasizing the necessity to carry out detailed structural analyses on the oligosaccharide species that occur in these unusual circumstances. The most likely hypothesis to explain the block in LLO biosynthesis was a deficiency in dolichyl-P-Man:Man7GlcNAc2-PP-dolichyl α6-mannosyltransferase. In yeast, this enzyme is thought to be encoded by the ALG12 gene (48Jakob C.A. Burda P. Roth J. Aebi M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 1223-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar, 51Burda P. Aebi M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1426: 239-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). The proteins encoded by the ALG12 genes of different species are all hydrophobic, and like some membrane transporters may possess up to 10–12 transmembrane domains. Nevertheless, the peptide sequences of theALG12 gene products have features in common to those of the ALG3p which has been shown to have dolichyl-P-mannose:Man5GlcNAc2-PP-dolichyl mannosyltransferase activity (52Sharma C.B. Knauer R. Lehle L. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 2001; 382: 321-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), indicating that ALG12p is also likely to have mannosyltransferase activity. In the work presented here we characterized the human homolog of this gene, and the accuracy of the sequence we deposited in the data banks was attested to by the subsequent appearance of an identical “anonymous” cDNA sequence (GenBankTM accession number BC001729). Interestingly, we noted the presence of a consensus glycosylation site (N(K/R)S, see Fig.3) which was conserved in all species except yeast. Theoretical predictions of hALG12p transmembrane regions indicate that this glycosylation site is situated in an extramembrane loop sufficiently large to support glycosylation. The question of whether or not hALG12p is glycosylated will have to await experimental evidence.When the human wild type ALG12 gene was introduced into the fibroblasts of the patient, we noted a remarkable normalization of LLO biosynthesis (Fig. 5 B), and a concomitant increase in the fraction of fully mannosylated oligosaccharides was transferred from dolichol onto polypeptide (results not shown). These observations strongly suggest that the ALG12 gene is defective in the patient described here.We found the hALG12 cDNA of the patient to be homozygous for a single point mutation that leads to replacement of a Phe residue by Val in the encoded protein. Several lines of argument suggest that this mutation is the underlying cause of the Man7GlcNAc2-PP-dolichyl accumulation observed in fibroblasts obtained from patient ME. First, examination of the size of the hALG12 mRNA transcript from the fibroblasts of the patient revealed it to be identical to that observed for the transcript present in other cell lines, indicating normal processing and the absence of an important deletion. Second, this mRNA transcript appeared to be as abundant as that observed in control fibroblasts, signifying on the one hand that both alleles are expressed and on the other hand an absence of mRNA instability. Third, analysis of the human EST banks allowed us to identify 28 separate human ESTs containing the region of the mutation, but we were unable to detect the T571G base change in any of these sequences, suggesting that the mutation is not simply a common polymorphism. Fourth, the F142V replacement occurs in one of the small highly conserved patches toward the NH2 terminus of ALG12p. In fact, in all species for which sequence data are available, we noted that the position of the replaced Phe residue in the ALG12p is invariably occupied by the aromatic amino acids Phe or Tyr (Schizosaccharomyces pombe) and that this position is next to a completely conserved Tyr residue. At present the role of this pair of highly conserved aromatic amino acids in ALG12p function is not understood, but our observations suggest that they are situated in, or near, a transmembrane domain. Indeed, several point mutations in glycosyltransferases that lead to CDG type I have been noted to occur in the transmembrane regions of these proteins.2 To conclude, the above arguments strongly favor our assertion that the point mutation identified in thehALG12 cDNA of patient ME is responsible for the accumulation of Man7GlcNAc2-PP-dolichyl observed in skin biopsy fibroblasts obtained from this subject.As observed for other types of CDG I, the observed mutation is leaky (18Körner C. Lehle L. von Figura K. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 165-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 22Körner C. Knauer R. Holzbach U. Hanefeld F. Lehle L. von Figura K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6816-6822Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) because small amounts of fully mannosylated LLO can be detected in cells from the patient. This leakiness allows a substantial transfer of Glc3Man9GlcNAc2 from dolichol onto nascent polypeptides in the fibroblasts of the patient. We also observed that N-linked Glc3Man7GlcNAc2 and Man7GlcNAc2 account for the remaining two-thirds of the total oligosaccharide transferred onto protein from oligosaccharide lipid. The relative abundance of these latter two species linked on the one hand to lipid and on the other handN-linked to polypeptide suggests the following: first, the lipid-linked Man7GlcNAc2 is poorly glucosylated; second, the small amount of lipid-linked Glc3Man7GlcNAc2 that is formed can be more efficiently transferred to protein than its non-glucosylated counterpart. The observation that substantial amounts of non-glucosylated Man7GlcNAc2 can be transferred from lipid onto protein was surprising considering that human skin biopsy fibroblasts deficient in dolichol-P-Glc:Man9GlcNAc2-PP-dolichol transferase do not appear to be able to transfer Man9GlcNAc2 directly onto protein (22Körner C. Knauer R. Holzbach U. Hanefeld F. Lehle L. von Figura K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13200-13205Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). However, this phenomenon has been observed in mouse F9 teratocarcinoma cells (46Romero P. Herscovics A. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15936-15940Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It would be interesting to look for mutations in the mouseALG12 gene in the F9 cell line. To summarize, it appears that in addition to leading to only a partial block in hALG12p function, the truncated Man7GlcNAc2intermediate that accumulates can be transferred directly onto protein. Despite these relieving factors, it is apparent the clinical picture for patient ME is severe, comprising both central nervous system and peripheral deficits. At present it is unclear whether or not a deficiency in hALG12p will invariably lead to a severe type of CDG I; only characterization of other patients with the same enzymic deficit will answer this question. However, one compounding factor may contribute to the severity of the symptoms observed in this case. In fact, observations made with a yeast strain deficient inALG12 led investigators to suspect that misfolded glycoproteins bearing N-linked Man7GlcNAc2 are poor substrates for ER-associated glycoprotein degradation (48Jakob C.A.

Although these observations have yet to be extended to mammalian cells, it is possible that in fibroblasts from ME such a phenomenon could exacerbate the ER accumulation of glycoproteins that may result from the misfolding of hypoglycosylated polypeptides (53Marquardt T. Ullrich K. Zimmer K.-P. Hasilik A. Deufel T. Harms E. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 66: 268-273PubMed Google Scholar). Under these conditions, the resulting stress generated in the ER could have profound effects on the cellular homeostasis of such cells. Furthermore, it has been shownin vitro that the “processing” isomers of Man7GlcNAc (generated by ER mannosidases) that are substrates for UDP-glucose:glycoprotein glucosyltransferase have only 15% of the acceptor activity of Man9GlcNAc (54Sousa M.C. Ferrero-Garcia M.A. Parodi A.J. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 97-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). However, we show here that the “biosynthetic” Man7GlcNAc structure that is transferred directly from dolichol onto protein in cells from patient ME can be glucosylated by UDP-glucose:glycoprotein glucosyltransferase, presumably as part of the glycoprotein “quality control” system.To conclude, our results indicate that a F142V replacement in hALG12p is the cause of inefficient addition of the eighth mannose residue onto Man7GlcNAc2-PP-dolichol during glycoprotein biosynthesis in a patient with type I CDG. The insufficiency in this step of the pathway for lipid-linked oligosaccharide biosynthesis defines a new subtype of the disease that we suggest should be called type Ig.Note Added in ProofThe GenBank™ AL671710 genomic sequence located in chromosome 22q13.3 contains the ALG12 gene. Oligosaccharides N-linked to glycoproteins are initially synthesized on a lipid carrier in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)1 membrane by the stepwise addition of monosaccharides onto dolichol pyrophosphate to form Glc3Man9GlcNAc2-PP-dolichol (1Abeijon C.

The resulting oligomannose-type oligosaccharides N-linked to glycoproteins are involved in the folding (3Parodi A.J. Annu. Rev.

FEBS Lett. 2000; 476: 32-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) of glycoproteins in the secretory pathway. During their passage through the Golgi apparatus, the oligomannose-type sugar units attached to glycoproteins are often partially demannosylated and subsequently decorated with GlcNAc, galactose, sialic acid, and fucose residues (2Kornfeld R. Kornfeld S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 631-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (3752) Google Scholar). The resulting glycoproteins, bearing complex-type oligosaccharide, are subsequently secreted into the extracellular space or exported to the cell surface where they are involved in diverse regulatory processes (8Varki A. Glycobiology. 1993; 3: 97-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (4963) Google Scholar). The importance of this widespread cotranslational modification is attested to by the identification of a rapidly growing number of diseases whose molecular origins have been linked to abnormalities in glycoprotein biosynthesis (9Aebi M.

Type I congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG I) are newly described rare metabolic diseases presenting a severe clinical picture in which multisystemic lesions including central and peripheral nervous system deficits are apparent (9Aebi M.

Although the molecular events leading to this complicated clinical picture are multifactorial and not well understood, the disease is characterized at the biochemical level by under-glycosylated serum glycoproteins of hepatic origin (16Seta N. Barnier A. Hochedez F. Besnard M.A. Durand G. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1996; 254: 131-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Disruption of any one of the enzymic steps involved in the biosynthesis of lipid-linked oligosaccharides (LLO) and the transfer of the mature oligosaccharide onto protein could potentially lead to the glycoprotein hypoglycosylation that is considered to be the hallmark of CDG I. Work on the underlying genetic bases of CDG I is still at an early stage because genes encoding the proteins involved in glycoprotein biosynthesis are numerous and, at least in humans, have for the most part yet to be identified (9Aebi M. Hennet T. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 136-141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar).

Activation of p38 and JNK by an active MAPK kinase 6 stimulates VDR promoter activity independently of the ligand vitamin D3 and estrogen receptor expression.

The ERK pathway, downstream of Ras, is predominantly activated by mitogenic stimuli, whereas the p38 and JNK pathways are preferentially stimulated by environmental stresses. Although biological consequence of p38 and JNK activation in many cases overlaps with that of the ERK (1Nebreda A.R. Porras A. Trends Biochem.

The mechanisms leading to the functional diversity and/or specificity of the cellular physiological outcome of MAPK signaling are largely unknown and may relate to regulation of their specific downstream target genes. Although the p38 and JNK pathways can regulate expression of many molecules (2Ono K. Han J. Cell. Signal. 2000; 12: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (1372) Google Scholar, 6Ichijo H. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6087-6093Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar), only a few of the true target genes selectively responsive to these stress pathways have been identified. The active form of vitamin D3, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, is a hormone with known activity in the regulation of calcium homeostasis, cell proliferation, and cell differentiation (7Jones G. Strugnell S.A. Deluca H.F. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 1193-1231Crossref PubMed Scopus (999) Google Scholar). Vitamin D3 binds to its nuclear steroid receptor (VDR), a transcription factor, which dimerizes with itself or other nuclear receptors such as retinoid X receptor (RXR) to regulate gene expression by specific vitamin D response elements (VDREs) through which vitamin D3 exerts its biological effects (7Jones G. Strugnell S.A. Deluca H.F. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 1193-1231Crossref PubMed Scopus (999) Google Scholar, 8Schrader M. Muller K.M. Carlberg C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5501-5504Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Vitamin D3 is well known for its therapeutic activity against breast cancer, which in many cases requires the presence of functional VDR (9Berger U. McClelland R.A. Wilson P. Greene G.L. Haussler M.

Loss of VDR expression in human breast cancer cells is frequently associated with the resistance to vitamin D3-dependent growth inhibition (10Buras R. Schumaker L.M. Davoodi F. Brenner R.V. Shabahang M. Nauta R.J. Evans R.T. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 1994; 31: 191-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), whereas its up-regulation by different means increases the sensitivity in different systems (11Agadir A. Lazzaro G. Zheng Y.

Alteration of VDR expression consequently emerges as an important approach for the regulation of vitamin D3 activity in inhibition of cancer cell proliferation. The signaling mechanisms by which VDR is regulated, however, remain largely undiscovered. The signaling connection between MAPK activation and nuclear steroid hormone receptors is complex. The classical model is that the steroid hormone, because of its hydrophobic property, diffuses across the cellular membrane and binds to its nuclear receptor to regulate target gene expression through specific steroid receptor-responsive regulatory elements in the target genes, unrelated to MAPK regulation (15Chen H.C. Farese R.V., Jr. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: R478-R481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 16Olefsky J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36863-36864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Recent experimental evidence suggests that there exist multiple interactions between the ERK- and JNK-MAPK pathways and the estrogen and progesterone steroid receptors at many levels (15Chen H.C.

(i) The Ras-ERK pathway phosphorylates the estradiol/estrogen receptor (ER) and increases its transcription activity (17Kato S. Endoh H. Masuhiro Y. Kitamoto T. Uchiyama S. Sasaki H. Masushige S.

(ii) In reverse, signaling through ER and progestins/progesterone receptor (PR) stimulates the Ras/ERK activity (20Migliaccio A. Domenico M.D. Castoria G. de Falco A. Bontempo P. Nola N. Auricchio F.

Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6122-6131Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) and independent of the ligand (24Abreu-Martin M. Chari A. Palladino A.A. Craft N.A. Sawyers C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5143-5154Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). (iv) Interactions also can occur between transcription factors (c-Jun and c-Fos) activated by the MAPK pathways and the nuclear steroid receptors via direct binding (25Duan R. Xie W. Burghardt R.C. Safa S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11590-11598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar,26Lee S.K. Kim H.J., Na, S.Y. Kim T.S. Choi H.S., Im, S.Y. Lee J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16651-16654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Although direct phosphorylation of ER and PR by MAPKs is involved in many of these processes, it remains unknown whether MAPKs can regulate steroid hormone receptor gene expression. Knowledge about transcriptional regulation of steroid receptor expression is critical for understanding steroid hormone effects. This is particularly important for VDR, because in many cell/tissue types the VDR level is limiting (7Jones G. Strugnell S.A. Deluca H.F. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 1193-1231Crossref PubMed Scopus (999) Google Scholar), and its concentration consequently largely determines the magnitude of the hormone-induced biological responses. It has been postulated that the Ras/ERK suppresses vitamin D3/VDR signaling, because ras-transformed cells have lower levels of VDR expression than their normal counterparts (27Escaleira M.T.F. Brentani M.M. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 1999; 54: 123-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Accordingly, ras-transformed keratinocytes are resistant to vitamin D3-induced growth inhibition in comparison with their normal counterparts (28Sebag M. Henderson J. Rhim J. Kremer R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12162-12167Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Solomon C. White J.H. Kremer R. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 1729-1735Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Consistent with this observation, activation of the Ras-ERK pathway by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (30Krishnan A. Feldman D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 86: 2071-2079Google Scholar), epidermal growth factor, and fibroblast growth factor (27Escaleira M.T.F. Brentani M.M. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 1999; 54: 123-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) down-regulates VDR expression. Furthermore, elevated Ras/ERK activity was demonstrated to be correlated with the disruption of VDR/RXR heterodimer (31Solomon C. Sebag M. White E. Rhim J. Kremer R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17573-17578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Because the Ras/ERK and the p38 MAPK pathways frequently have an opposite role in many systems (32Berra E. Diaz M.M. Moscat J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10792-10797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 33Oh C. Chang S. Yoon Y. Lee S. Lee Y. Kang S. Chun J. J. Biol.

Science. 1995; 270: 1326-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (5019) Google Scholar), the inhibition of VDR activity by Ras may be either a direct consequence of Ras-ERK activation or the p38 pathway inactivation. Consequently, it may be reasoned that p38 kinase might stimulate VDR activity. In this report we have tested the hypothesis that the stress-activated protein kinase p38 stimulates VDR and thereby increases VDR activity and vitamin D3-induced growth inhibition. By application of genetic as well as chemical stimuli, our results establish that the signaling through both the p38 and JNK integrated at c-Jun/AP-1 is not only sufficient but essential to trans-activate VDR. The VDR activation by this pathway was further shown to sensitize human breast cancer MCF-7 cells to vitamin D3-induced growth inhibition. Recombinant adenovirus vectors containing hemagglutinin-tagged MKK6 and MEK1 were constructed as described previously (35Huang S. Jiang Y., Li, Z. Nishida E. Mathias P. Lin S. Ulevitch R.J.

Briefly, hemagglutinin-tagged active MKK6 and MEK1 were subcloned into the vector pAd/RSV, and then were co-transfected with the adenovirus-packaging plasmid pJM17 into 293 cells. A control recombinant adenovirus lacking a cDNA insert was constructed using pAd/RSV and pJM17. High–titered stocks of the recombinant adenoviruses (∼1 × 1010 plaque-forming units/ml) were produced and purified at the Virus Core Facility of the Cleveland Clinic Foundation. Mouse VDR promoter (0.5 kb) was cloned and inserted into a pGL2 basic vector (Promega) in front of the luciferase gene as described previously (37Jehan F. Deluca H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

This plasmid as well as the pCMV5 vectors containing FLAG-tagged wild type and kinase dead form of p38α (p38/AF) and pGEX for GST-ATF2 were kindly provided by Roger Davis (45Raingeaud J. Whitmarsh A.J. Barrett T. Derijard B. Davis R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1247-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1137) Google Scholar). A mammalian expression plasmid pcDNA3-containing cDNA for myc epitope-tagged MK2 was supplied by Matthias Gaestel (46Engel K. Schultz H. Martin F. Kotlyarov A. Plath K. Hahn M. Heinemann U.

Newgard as described previously (41Chen G. Templeton D. Suttle D.P. Stacey D. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7149-7160Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). An AP-1 luciferase construct, which was generated by cloning three AP-1 repeats into a luciferase reporter gene containing a minimal Fos promoter, was kindly provided by Craig Hauser (47Galang C.K. Der C.J. Hauser C.A. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2913-2921PubMed Google Scholar). Minimum essential medium,l-glutamine, and antibiotics were supplied by Invitrogen. Fetal bovine serum was obtained from BioWhittaker. DNA was prepared using an Endofree kit from Qiagen. A DNA transfection kit (calcium phosphate) and a dual luciferase kit were purchased from Promega. SB203580 was purchased from Calbiochem. Glutathione agarose beads were from Sigma. Protein G-Sepharose 4B and protein A-Sepharose 4B beads were purchased from Zymed Laboratories. Goat anti-MKK6, rabbit anti-MEK1, rabbit anti-VDR, goat anti-JNK2, and rabbit antibodies against p38, c-Fos, c-Jun, and ATF2 (the ATF2 recombinant protein) were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel and MBP for ERK assay were bought from Sigma. Vitamin D3 was provided by Hoffmann-La Roche. GST-Jun for JNK assay was purified with glutathione agarose beads (48Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene. 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5028) Google Scholar). [γ-32P]ATP and dCTP and [methyl-3H]thymidine were from AmershamBiosciences. Human breast cancer cell lines MCF-7 and MDA-MB-468 were obtained from ATCC and maintained in minimal essential medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics at 37 °C with 5% CO2. An MCF-7 subline stably expressing Tam67 (MCF/Tam) was generated by transfecting MCF-7 cells with equal amounts of pCMV-Tam and pcDNA3 (neomycin-resistant expression plasmid) using the FuGENE 6 kit (Invitrogen) followed by selection with 0.6 mg/ml G418 for one month (44Janulis M. Silberman S. Ambegaokar A. Gutkind J.S. Schultz R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 801-813Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The resistant clones were pooled, and early passages of these cells were used for experiments. Expression of the transfected c-Jun Tam67 was detected using a c-Jun antibody (sc-44-G, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) that recognizes the COOH-terminal DNA-binding region (residues 247–263) of c-Jun. For transient transfection, the protocol of calcium phosphate-mediated transfection from Promega followed. Cells were allowed to grow for 48 h in serum-free medium before being collected for various assays. For adenovirus infection, cells were typically plated for a day before and switched to serum-free medium the next day. Cells were incubated with adenovirus (50 plaque-forming units/cell) for 5 h and then further incubated for 24 (468) or 48 h (MCF-7) to allow expression of proteins of interest. For cell proliferation, cells were infected with the control virus or the adenovirus coding for MKK6 for 5 h in serum-free minimal essential medium in six-well plates as mentioned above. Following infection, cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline and fed with serum-free medium containing the vehicle or 0.1 μm of vitamin D3 for 48 h. For the last 4 h of cell culture, 1 μCi of [3H]thymidine (Amersham Biosciences) was added (49Chen G. Hitomi M. Han J. Stacey D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38973-38980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). After trypsinization, the amount of thymidine incorporated into cells was determined by scintillation counting using ScintiSafeTM Plus 50% (Fisher Scientific) in a Scintillation Counter (Beckman). The results of these proliferation studies and the following luciferase assay, Western blot analyses, Northern blot analyses, and kinase assays were analyzed with the Student's t test for the statistically significant difference. Cells were transfected with calcium phosphate according to the Promega manual for 5 h (total 3 μg of DNA per 2 ml/well in a six-well plate). By the end of the experiments (48 h after DNA removal), cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and collected in the lysis buffer. Luciferase activity of the promoter was assayed with a dual luciferase kit from Promega using pRL-TK (encoding Renilla luciferase) as a normalization control in a TD-20/20 Luminometer (Turner Designs). Mutations in the potential AP-1 binding site of mVDR-luc plasmid were performed with the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene as instructed in the user manual. The sequences of the PCR primers were M1: FW, 5′-CTCAGGTACGGGTGCTACACCTGGGGGAGGCG-3′ and REV, 5′-CGTAAACGCCTCCCCCAGGTGTAGCACCCGTACCTGAG-3′; M2: FW, 5′-CTCAGGTACGGGTGCTAGGCCTGGGGGAGGCG-3′ and REV, 5′-CTGTAAACGCCTCCCCCAGGCCTAGCACCCGTACCTGAG-3′. The size of the mutated plasmid was verified with restriction enzyme digestion analysis, and the correct sized plasmid was used for further confirmation by DNA sequencing for the desired mutations. For Western blot analyses, cells were lysed in modified radioimmune precipitation buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μg/ml aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin). Protein concentration was determined by the DC Protein Assay kit (Bio-Rad). Typically, 50 μg of protein was separated by SDS-PAGE, which was transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane for detection of the molecule of interest using ECL (AmershamBiosciences) as described previously (41Chen G. Templeton D. Suttle D.P. Stacey D. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7149-7160Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). For Northern blot, total RNA was prepared by TRIzol (Invitrogen). Human VDR cDNA in pCMV vector (kindly provided by Leonard Freedman (50Liu M. Lee M.H. Bommakanti M. Freedman L.P. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 142-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (816) Google Scholar)) was digested withApaI/XbaI to generate a fragment as the probe. The probe was labeled with [32P]dCTP using the High Prime kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and purified with Quick Spin Columns (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The Northern blots were standardized for equal application of RNA by comparing the UV fluorescence of the 18 S rRNA band. Following infection or arsenite (ARS) treatment, about 1 × 107 cells were lysed in 10 mmTris, pH 8.0, containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 2 mmMgCl2, 5 mm KCl, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride on ice for 15 min after washing once with cold phosphate-buffered saline (51Thomas R.S.

Chem. 1997; 272: 5927-5935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Cells then were scraped down, and the pellets were resuspended in 100 μl of nuclear lysis buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 500 mmNaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and proteinase inhibitors (Cocktail, Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The mixture was incubated on ice for 30 min with vortexing every 5 min. Following spin, the supernatant was either stored at −80 °C (normally used within 2 weeks) or used immediately for EMSA. For EMSA, 5 μg of nuclear protein was pre-incubated in DNA binding buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 60 mm KCl, 4% Ficoll, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mg/ml of poly [d(I-C)] (Amersham Biosciences). In supershift assays, incubation was in the absence or presence of 1 μg of respective antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology: rabbit anti-ATF2, cat. no. sc-187 X; rabbit anti c-Jun, cat. no. sc-44 X) for 15 min. The mixture was then incubated with ∼105 cpm-labeled probe in the absence or presence of 50-fold cold oligos on ice for 30 min. The double-stranded oligonucleotides were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology with the sequence as follows: AP-1 consensus oligonucleotide, 5′-CGC TTG ATG ACT CAG CCG GAA-3′; AP-1 mutant oligonucleotide, 5′-CGC TTG ATG ACT tgG CCG GAA-3′; VDRE consensus oligonucleotide (DR-3), 5′-AGC TTC AGG TCAAGG AGG TCA GAG AGC-3′. The oligonucleotides were labeled with [32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase for 45–60 min and purified by Qiaquick nucleotide remove kit (Qiagen). Following incubation, the mixture was subjected to a native 4.5% acrylamide gel in 0.5× Tris borate/EDTA buffer. The gels then were dried and subjected to autoradiography. Cells were collected by trypsinization, and pellets were quick-frozen in liquid nitrogen after washing and spinning. The pellet either was stored at −80 °C or was used immediately for protein preparation (resuspended in 100 μl of the lysis buffer and incubated on ice for 30 min with vortexing for 30 s every 10 min). Protein (200 μg) was incubated either with 30 μl of 50% glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma) for GST-tagged ERK or JNK or with 20 μl of anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel (Sigma) for FLAG-tagged p38 at 4 °C in a rotating plate overnight. For endogenous JNK and p38 kinase assay, the protein was incubated with 1 μg of polyclonal antibodies from Santa Cruz Biotechnology against JNK2 (sc-572) and p38 (sc-535) and with 30 μl of protein A-Sepharose (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) at a volume of 300 μl. All of the beads were washed four times with the lysis buffer before adding to the mixture. The precipitates were washed twice with respective lysis buffer and twice with kinase binding buffer (20 mm HEPES pH 7.6, 50 mm NaCl, 0.05% Triton X-100, 0.1 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm MgCl2). The kinase reaction was carried out at 30 °C for 30 min in 25 μl of kinase reaction buffer (20 mm HEPES pH 7.6, 20 mm MgCl2, 15 μm ATP, 20 mm β-glycerol- phosphate, 20 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate, 0.5 mm Na3VO4, 2 mmdithiothreitol) as described previously (41Chen G. Templeton D. Suttle D.P. Stacey D. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7149-7160Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 49Chen G. Hitomi M. Han J. Stacey D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38973-38980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). [γ-32P]ATP (5 μCi) and 1 μg of substrate protein were used for each sample. Substrates for the kinase reactions were MBP for ERK, GST-Jun for JNK, and ATF-2 for p38. Following a 30-min reaction at 30 °C, an equal volume of 2× Laemmli buffer was added to stop the reaction. The phosphorylated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE. The gels were dried, scanned, and quantitated in a phosphorimager. Each kinase assay starting at transfection and ending with the determination of the protein kinase activity was repeated two to three times with similar results. To test directly the hypothesis that p38 kinase stimulates VDR expression, the mouse VDR promoter in a luciferase reporter vector (VDR-Luc) (37Jehan F. Deluca H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10138-10143Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) was expressed transiently in human breast cancer MCF-7 cells with a constitutively active MKK6 (MKK6/E), an upstream activator of p38 kinase (45Raingeaud J. Whitmarsh A.J. Barrett T. Derijard B. Davis R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1247-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1137) Google Scholar), or an empty vector control. As a further control, a constitutively active MEK1 (MEK1/E), an ERK activator, was co-transfected with the VDR-Luc vector into MCF-7 cells. It was observed that MKK6/E expression stimulates the VDR-Luc promoter activity by 10-fold, whereas the transfection with MEK1 has no effect (Fig.1 A). Because vitamin D3 is known to induce its receptor, VDR, protein expression (53Wiese R.J. Rhland-Smith A. Ross T.K. Prahl J.M. DeLuca H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20082-20086Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 54Li X.Y. Boudjelal M. Xiao J.H. Peng Z.H. Asuru A. Kang S. Fisher G.J. Voorhees J.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 1686-1694Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), we examined whether the MKK6 activation is regulated by vitamin D3. Accordingly, MKK6/E- and VDR-Luc-transfected cells were incubated with 0.1 μm vitamin D3for 48 h prior to the luciferase assay. The results showed that the VDR promoter activation in MCF-7 cells is independent of vitamin D3. This is consistent with the lack of a potential VDRE sequence in the VDR promoter (37Jehan F.

During low oxygen tension these proteins modulate a network of genes that are necessary for angiogenesis, erythropopoiesis, and glycolysis. We report here that the C-terminal transactivation domain of HLF is phosphorylated on multiple sites and that phosphorylation on threonine 844 of HLF is necessary for the transcriptional activation function of the protein independently of the hypoxia condition.

J. Appl. Physiol. 2000; 88: 1474-1480Crossref PubMed Scopus (1503) Google Scholar). Oxygen tension is also an important factor for regulation of mammalian genes that are involved in angiogenesis, vasculogenesis, glucose metabolism, and apoptosis (for a review see Ref. 1Semenza G.L. J. Appl. Physiol. 2000; 88: 1474-1480Crossref PubMed Scopus (1503) Google Scholar). These oxygen-sensitive genes are regulated by the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1α,1 (2Wang G.L. Jiang B.H.

Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2000; 40: 519-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar). The mechanism of activation of oxygen-regulated genes has been determined mainly by studies of HIF-1α; however, the important functional domains in HIF-1α are highly conserved in HLF (4Ema M. Taya S.

Moreover, HIF-1α appears to have a general role by conferring oxygen-dependent regulation to the transcription machinery in all cells, whereas HLF is cell type-restricted and plays a more specialized role, according to analysis of knock-out mice of HIF-1α and HLF (6Iyer N.V. Kotch L.E. Agani F. Leung S.W. Laughner E. Wenger R.H. Gassmann M. Gearhart J.D. Lawler A.M., Yu, A.Y. Semenza G.L. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 149-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (2068) Google Scholar, 7Tian H.

The N-terminal half of these proteins contains a basic helix-loop-helix domain (bHLH) and a PER-ARNT-SIM (PAS) homology domain. The basic domain is necessary for DNA-binding, and both the helix-loop-helix and the PER-ARNT-SIM homology domain are necessary for dimerization of HIF-1α and HLF to their partner factor, the aryl hydrocarbon nuclear translocator (ARNT) protein. Under hypoxic conditions the heterodimer binds to specific consensus DNA sequences and up-regulates genes such as erythropoietin, vascular endothelial growth factor, and glycolytic enzymes (for a review see Ref. 1Semenza G.L. J. Appl. Physiol. 2000; 88: 1474-1480Crossref PubMed Scopus (1503) Google Scholar). The stimulatory effect of hypoxia is caused by stabilization of the oxygen-sensitive HIF-1α and HLF. At normoxia these two proteins are rapidly degraded through the ubiquitin-proteasome machinery that involves the von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor (pVHL) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex (9Kallio P.J.

In the C-terminal half of both HIF-1α and HLF two transactivation domains, the N-terminal transactivation domain and C-terminal transactivation domain (CAD) are located, and it has been shown that these transactivation domains interact with coactivators such as the histone acetyltransferase cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB)-binding protein (CBP)/p300, SRC-1, and TIF-2 (16Kallio P.J.

Recent studies have shown that HLF and HIF-1α are phosphoproteins and that the proteins are phosphorylated in the hypoxic cell (20Conrad P.W. Freeman T.L. Beitner-Johnson D. Millhorn D.E. J. Biol.

Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 216: 669-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). More recently, it has been reported that the Ser/Thr kinase Akt regulates HIF-1α stability (22Beitner-Johnson D. Rust R.T. Hsieh T.C. Millhorn D.E. Cell. Signal. 2001; 13: 23-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), and some reports also suggest that mitogen-activated protein kinases phosphorylate HIF-1α and increase the transcriptional activity of the protein (21Richard D.E. Berra E. Gothie E. Roux D. Pouyssegur J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32631-32637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar). However, the sites for phosphorylation and the mechanism behind the enhanced transactivation function have not yet been elucidated. In this study we were interested to investigate the role of phosphorylation in modulating the transactivation function of HLF. To understand the role of phosphorylation of the C-terminal transactivation domain in a cellular context, we have analyzed putative phosphorylation sites that are conserved between HLF and HIF-1α. To overcome the complex and interactive nature of post-translational modifications of HLF we have established these mutations in fusion proteins comprising the CAD of HLF and the heterologous DNA-binding domain of the Gal4 protein. By this approach we could analyze the CAD transactivation activity without the influence of other functional domains within HLF. In conclusion, we have shown that the transactivation capacity of both HLF and HIF-1α depends on phosphorylation of the conserved residue Thr-844 and that this modification increases the affinity of the hypoxia-regulated proteins to the transcriptional coactivator CBP. Human embryo kidney HEK 293T cells and human cervix carcinoma HeLa cells were routinely maintained in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium and Eagle's minimal essential medium, respectively, and supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 58 μg/ml kanamycin. The cells were transiently transfected using the calcium phosphate DNA co-precipitation method as described previously (17Ema M. Hirota K. Mimura J. Abe H. Yodoi J. Sogawa K. Poellinger L. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1905-1914Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For reporter assay experiments, cells were transiently transfected with expression plasmids (see legends to Figs. Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4) together with a luciferase reporter gene carrying the upstream activation sequence (p(UAS)3-luc) and pBos-LacZ. 6 h after transfection, the cells received fresh medium and were either exposed to normoxia (21% O2) or hypoxia (1% O2) or were treated with 100 μm CoCl2 or vehicle (H2O) for 18 h before harvesting. The luciferase activity was determined using a luciferase detection kit (Promega) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Luminescence was measured in a Victor multilabel plate reader (EG & G Wallac, Turku, Finland). The luciferase activity directed by various gene constructs was corrected for the β-galactosidase activity and protein content in the same samples, and each construct was analyzed as specified in the legends to Figs. 1, 2, and 4.Figure 2Aspartic acid and serine restore the transactivation function of the alanine mutation on amino acid 844 in HLF. Thr-844 mutated to different amino acids (T844A, T844D, T844E, T844G, and T844S) were fused to the Gal4DBD and transiently transfected into HeLa cells. The cells were subsequently exposed to 21 or 1% oxygen (A) or 100 μm CoCl2or vehicle (H2O) (B) for 18 h before harvesting.

Hirota K. Mimura J. Abe H. Yodoi J. Sogawa K. Poellinger L. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1905-1914Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The different Gal4 DNA binding domain (Gal4DBD) HLFCAD-mutated plasmids were constructed by cloning an oligonucleotide containing the specific mutant that was spanning the region of HLFCAD between the SalI site and theSse8387I. Oligonucleotides containing the different mutants with a SalI overhang in the 5′-end and a Sse8387I overhang in the 3′-end were then cloned into the SalI- andSse8387I-digested pBos-Gal4DBD-HLFCADwt plasmid. A glutathione-S-transferase (GST) fusion construct, pBos-GST-HLFCADwt, was generated by inserting the blunt-endedSalI-BalI fragment of pBos-Gal4DBD-HLFCADwt into the SmaI site of pBosGST. pBos-Gal4DBD-HIF-1αCADwt has been described previously (17Ema M. Hirota K. Mimura J. Abe H. Yodoi J. Sogawa K. Poellinger L. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1905-1914Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and pBos-Gal4DBD-HIF-1αCADT796A and pBos-Gal4DBD-HIF-1αCADT796D were constructed using the QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and pBos-Gal4DBD-HIF-1αCADwt as template. pBos-Gal4AD CBP1–452 was constructed by inserting the blunt-endedHindIII fragment of pGAD424CBP1–452 (17Ema M. Hirota K. Mimura J. Abe H. Yodoi J. Sogawa K. Poellinger L. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1905-1914Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) into theXbaI site of pBos vector, which had been treated with Klenow fragment. pBos-Gal4AD-CBP313–452 was constructed by deleting theEcoRV fragment from pBos-Gal4AD-CBP1–452. All DNA-constructions were validated by sequence analysis. Because of low expression levels of the overexpressed proteins in HeLa cells, HEK 293T cells were used to compare the expression levels of various constructs. HEK 293T cells were transfected with wild-type and mutant constructs using the calcium phosphate DNA co-precipitation method. After 18 h the cells were harvested and lysed in radioimmune precipitation buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, 2 mm EDTA) supplemented with 1 mm dithiothreitol and protease inhibitors (33 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml pepstatin A). 30 μg of the whole cell extract were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and the proteins were subsequently transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Biosciences). For Western blot analysis rabbit anti-Gal4DBD antibody (Upstate Biotechnology) diluted 1:1000 was used as first antibody, and goat anti-rabbit biotinylated IgG (Vector Laboratories) was used as secondary antibody. The membrane was then incubated with streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase complex (Vector Laboratories), and finally the ECL developing kit (AmershamBiosciences) was used to identify the relevant bands. HEK 293T cells cultured in a 6-cm dish were transfected with 3 μg of either pBos-GST-HLFCADwt or pBos-GST-HLFCADT844A using the calcium phosphate DNA co-precipitation method. After 6 h the medium was changed, and the cells were cultured with or without 100 μm CoCl2 for 36 h. The cells were then cultured in phosphate-free medium for 1 h following an incubation with 100 μCi [32P]orthophosphate (Amersham Biosciences) in phosphate-free medium for 4 h, and subsequently whole cell extracts were prepared in radioimmune precipitation buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, 2 mm EDTA) supplemented with 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmsodium orthovanadate, and protease inhibitors (33 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml pepstatin A). The whole cell extracts were incubated together with glutathione-Sepharose and bacterially expressed GST-HLFCAD that was used as a carrier protein for 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were then washed three times with lysis buffer, and the proteins were eluted by boiling for 5 min in SDS sample buffer. 10% of the eluted proteins were applied to a 12% SDS-PAGE gel, subsequently dried, and exposed to x-ray film, and quantitative analysis was performed using a STORM 850 PhosphorImager analyzer (Molecular Dynamics). The in vitro translations were performed in the presence of [35S]methionine (Amersham Biosciences) using T3 or T7 polymerase-coupled rabbit reticulocyte lysates (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The GST fusion protein CBP-(1–452) and GST alone were produced in and purified fromEscherichia coli BL21 (Lys) strain as described (17Ema M. Hirota K. Mimura J. Abe H. Yodoi J. Sogawa K. Poellinger L. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1905-1914Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).35S-labeled full-length HLF wt and HLF T844A were incubated with GST or GST·CBP-(1–452) adsorbed to glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) at 4 °C in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 μm EDTA, and protease inhibitors (33 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml pepstatin A). After an overnight incubation the beads were pelleted and washed three times with binding buffer. The proteins were then eluted by boiling for 5 min in 50 μl of SDS sample buffer, and 20 μl of the eluted proteins were applied to a 7% SDS-PAGE gel. The gel was subsequently dried and exposed to x-ray film, and quantitative analysis was performed using a STORM 850 PhosphorImager analyzer. Standardized amounts of purified GST fusion proteins, as determined by staining with Coomassie Blue, were used in the pull-down assay. Two transactivation domains, N-terminal and C-terminal, have been identified previously in mouse HLF (17Ema M. Hirota K. Mimura J. Abe H. Yodoi J. Sogawa K. Poellinger L. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1905-1914Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These transactivation domains are localized between positions 450–571 and 824–876, respectively. Phosphorylation of specific amino acids in transactivation domains has been shown to be an important event for transcription mediated by many factors (p53, for example) (Ref. 24Dumaz N. Meek D.W. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 7002-7010Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar and references therein). In order to delineate the role of phosphorylation for the function of the CAD of HLF we constructed fusion plasmids spanning the Gal4DBD and the CAD (containing different amino acid substitutions), providing a system in which transcriptional activity of this protein could be assayed without interference of the N-terminal transcription domain and/or degradation. We focused on four putative phosphorylation sites in the CAD that are conserved between HLF and HIF-1α. The transcriptional activity of the mutants was compared with that of the wild-type protein following transient transfection of HeLa cells together with the luciferase reporter construct p(UAS)3-luc and the β-galactosidase reporter construct pBos-LacZ, which was used as an internal control. As a negative control pBos-Gal4DBD was used. In the presence of the latter protein very low levels of luciferase activity were observed regardless of whether the cells had been exposed to normoxia or hypoxia (Fig.1 A) or CoCl2 (Fig.1 B). The Gal4DBD-HLF-CADwt protein showed a 50-fold increase in transcriptional activity at normoxia compared with Gal4DBD, which was further enhanced four times at hypoxia (Fig. 1 A). The same pattern was observed when the cells were treated with CoCl2 (Fig. 1 B), which mimics the hypoxic condition, probably by inhibition of the proline and asparagine hydroxylases. When tyrosine 846 was mutated to a phenylalanine no differences in activation of HLFCAD was detected when compared with wild-type CAD. However, both of the mutations S834A and S857A produced a slight increase in the transactivation capacity. Interestingly, when the threonine at position 844 was substituted to an alanine the transactivation was totally abolished to almost the same levels as the Gal4DBD protein. To investigate whether the threonine was important also in the context of full-length HLF we constructed a Gal4DBD-HLF fusion protein. As shown in Fig. 1 C the transcription activity was decreased to ∼50% in the chimeric protein containing the T844A mutation. Hypoxia-dependent activation could still be detected, which probably is mediated by the N-terminal transactivation domain. These results indicate that threonine 844 is necessary for CAD-mediated transcriptional activation by HLF, and it encouraged us to study further the importance of Thr-844 in HLFCAD-mediated transcription. To investigate whether phosphorylation on the threonine is required for HLFCAD activity, we performed a more detailed mutation analysis of Thr-844. It is well known that both aspartic acid and glutamic acid can mimic a constitutively phosphorylated state of the protein. When we mutated Thr-844 to Asp constitutive activation of the luciferase reporter gene was observed, irrespective of normoxic or hypoxic conditions (Fig.2, A and B). However, substitution of Thr-844 to glutamic acid or to glycine abrogated the transcription activation function of HLFCAD to almost the same level as T844A (Fig. 2, A and B). Many kinases that phosphorylate threonine are also able to phosphorylate a serine residue. To test whether a substitution of Thr-844 to serine affected HLFCAD activity we performed transient transfection with a construct where the threonine was replaced by a serine. Interestingly, this mutated protein showed no or very low difference in inducibility by hypoxia and CoCl2 as compared with the wild-type protein. These results indicate that the potential kinase that phosphorylates the amino acid at position 844 recognizes both a threonine and a serine residue. All fusion proteins were expressed at equal levels except for the glutamic acid-containing peptide, which showed a slower migrating band (Fig. 2 C). This result may explain why the glutamic acid mutant did not show constitutive activity in analogy to the aspartic acid construct. Taken together, these results show that Thr-844 is a potential phosphorylation site in HLFCAD and that this residue is necessary for the function of HLFCAD. Next we analyzed thein vivo phosphorylation status of HLFCAD. HEK 293T cells were transiently transfected with pBOS-GST-mHLFCADwt or pBOS-GST-mHLFCADT844A. After treatment with vehicle or 100 μm CoCl2 for 36 h the cells were labeled with [32P]orthophosphate for 4 h in phosphate-free medium, and subsequently the GST-mHLFCAD proteins were purified with glutathione-Sepharose. As shown in Fig.3 A wild-type HLFCAD was labeled in vivo with orthophosphate. However, when the threonine at position 844 had been substituted to an alanine residue32P labeling was reduced by ∼35% (Fig. 3 B). These results tell us that the HLFCAD is phosphorylated at multiple sites and that one of the phosphorylated sites is Thr-844. It has been shown previously that CBP/p300 interacts with the CAD motifs of both HLF and HIF-1α and enhances transactivation of the proteins (17Ema M. Hirota K. Mimura J. Abe H. Yodoi J. Sogawa K. Poellinger L. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1905-1914Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Carrero P. Okamoto K. Coumailleau P. O'Brien S. Tanaka H. Poellinger L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 402-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). It was of interest, therefore, to determine whether mutation of Thr-844 affected the interaction between HLF and CBP/p300, and to investigate this interaction we utilized the mammalian two-hybrid assay. pBos-Gal4DBD-HLFCADwt or pBos-Gal4DBD-HIF-1αCADwt were transfected into HeLa cells together with a fusion protein between the Gal4 activation domain (Gal4AD) and the N-terminal domain of CBP/p300 containing the CH1 moiety, which previously has been shown to mediate the interaction between HLFCAD and HIF-1αCAD with CBP/p300 (17Ema M.

Med. 2000; 6: 1335-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). Both Gal4DBD-HLFCADwt and Gal4DBD-HIF-1αCADwt showed increased transcription activation in the presence of Gal4AD-CBP1–452 and CoCl2 (Fig. 4, Aand B). However, when the shorter fragment of CBP (Gal4AD-CBP313–452) was used very little effect was detected on the transactivation capacity of both HLF and HIF-1α in comparison with cells that had been transfected with the parental Gal4AD construct (Fig. 4, A and B). These results indicate that not only the CH1 domain but also the most N-terminal part of CBP is necessary for efficient interaction with HLF and HIF-1α. When Thr-844 in HLFCAD was mutated to an alanine the truncated chimeric CBP proteins had no effect or very little effect on the reporter gene activity. The same result was obtained when the corresponding threonine in HIF-1αCAD, Thr-796, was mutated to an alanine (Fig. 4,A and B). However, when Thr-844 in HLFCAD and Thr-796 in HIF-1αCAD were mutated to an aspartic acid the transactivation function of either protein was further enhanced in the presence of Gal4AD-CBP1–452 (Fig. 4, A and B). This effect was observed in two different cell lines upon exposure to hypoxia or CoCl2 treatment, demonstrating that the result was not caused by the cell type or the culture condition. To further investigate whether threonine 844 in HLFCAD was necessary for the interaction with CBP we used a GST pull-down assay. Recombinant GST·CBP-(1–452) or GST alone was incubated with in vitro-translated 35S-labeled full-length HLF or the HLF T844A mutant (Fig. 5 A). A strong interaction could be detected when GST·CBP-(1–452) was incubated with wild-type HLF (Fig 5 A, lane 3). However, when Thr-844 was substituted with an alanine the interaction was decreased ∼70% (Fig. 5, A and B, comparelanes 3 and 6), indicating that Thr-844 is important for the interaction with CBP. In addition, no binding was observed when the labeled HLF proteins were incubated with GST alone (Fig. 5 A, lanes 2 and 5). These results show that the specific threonine residue is necessary for CAD function not only in the context of HLF but also in the case of HIF-1α. In addition, phosphorylation of the conserved threonine appears to be necessary for interaction of HLF- and HIF-1α−CAD with CBP/p300. HLF and HIF-1α are regulated at multiple levels, including protein stabilization (9Kallio P.J. Pongratz I. Gradin K. McGuire J. Poellinger L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The most investigated mechanisms so far concern the stabilization of HIF-1α and the transcriptional activation function of HLF and HIF-1α. Phosphorylation and dephosphorylation are common mechanisms by which many transcription factors are regulated. Previous reports have shown that both HIF-1α and HLF are phosphorylated upon exposure to hypoxia and that the transcriptional activity is increased. However, the mechanism by which the transcriptional activity is enhanced is so far poorly understood (20Conrad P.W. Freeman T.L. Beitner-Johnson D. Millhorn D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33709-33713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 21Richard D.E. Berra E. Gothie E. Roux D. Pouyssegur J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32631-32637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar). We were therefore interested to investigate whether phosphorylation of the C-terminal transactivation domain influenced the transcription capacity of HLF. To do this, Gal4DBD fusion proteins were constructed containing wild-type HLFCAD or HLFCAD with different mutations at potential phosphorylation sites. We selected four different amino acids that are conserved between HLF and HIF-1α. In transient transfections three of these amino acids, two serines and one tyrosine, showed no or only a slightly enhanced transactivation function compared with the wild-type protein. However, if the threonine at position 844 was changed to an alanine the transcription activity was completely abolished. These data suggest that the threonine is an important residue in transactivation by HLF. Moreover, the homologous threonine residue in HIF-1α is equally important because HIF-1αCAD containing an alanine instead of threonine 796 exhibits the same low functional activity that was produced by the HLF mutation. At this stage the most important question was to verify the phosphorylation status of Thr-844. In the in vivophosphorylation experiment T844A CAD was clearly phosphorylated. However, compared with the wild-type CAD the in vivolabeling was reduced ∼35%. These results suggest that the HLFCAD is phosphorylated at multiple sites and that one of these sites is Thr-844. In addition, we have shown that a substitution of alanine to an aspartic acid fully restored the activity of HLFCAD. Taken together, these results demonstrate that the Thr-844 in HLF is phosphorylated and that a negative charge is required for the full functional activity of the HLFCAD. The data also indicate that there were no significant differences in the level of expression of the mutants compared with the wild-type CAD. In many reports it is shown that mitogen-activated protein kinases are activated by hypoxia (20Conrad P.W. Freeman T.L. Beitner-Johnson D. Millhorn D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33709-33713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 21Richard D.E. Berra E. Gothie E. Roux D. Pouyssegur J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32631-32637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar); however, no in vitro phosphorylation of HIF-1αCAD could be detected by p42/p44 mitogen-activated protein kinase. 2F. Wang, K. Sogawa, and Y. Fujii-Kuriyama, unpublished observation. The Thr-844 in HLF and the Thr-796 in HIF-1α are consensus sites for casein kinase II (CKII); nevertheless, HLFCAD could not be phosphorylated in vitro by CKII (data not shown). However, this result may not exclude that the potential kinase for Thr-844 and Thr-796 is a CKII-like kinase. It has been shown that CBP/p300 interacts with both HLF and HIF-1α to mediate contact with the basal transcription machinery (17Ema M. Hirota K. Mimura J. Abe H. Yodoi J. Sogawa K. Poellinger L.

Med. 2000; 6: 1335-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar) have shown that the interaction of CBP/p300 with HIF-1α CAD is necessary for hypoxia-inducible gene expression and for tumor growth. Using the mammalian two-hybrid system, we have shown that the enhanced transcription mediated by the CBP/p300 coactivator in wild-type CAD was very low if not totally abrogated in the context of an alanine substitution. Consistent with this observation, in vitro experiments demonstrate that Thr-844 in HLFCAD is important for interaction with CBP/p300. It has been observed previously that phosphorylation of the transactivation domain is necessary for CBP/p300 interaction by the tumor suppressor protein p53, where phosphorylation of Ser-15 increased the association of p53 with CBP/p300 in parallel with acetylation of the C-terminal domain, providing a link between phosphorylation and acetylation (26Lambert P.F.

Recently it has been shown that inhibition of hydroxylation of Asn-851 in HLFCAD under hypoxic conditions promotes the CAD region to interact with CBP/p300 (19Lando D. Peet D.J. Whelan D.A. Gorman J.J. Whitelaw M.L. Science. 2002; 295: 858-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (1280) Google Scholar); however, phosphorylation of Thr-844 in HLFCAD, regardless of the oxygen concentration, also seems to be necessary for the function of the transactivation domain. In summary, our data indicate that Thr-844 in HLF and Thr-796 in HIF-1α are constitutively phosphorylated and that this phosphorylation is important for the transactivation function of these proteins.

https://openalex.org/W2087158203,"5,6-Dihydrouridine (D) is a modified base found abundantly in the D-loops of tRNA from Archaea, Bacteria, and Eukarya. D is thought to be formed post-transcriptionally by the reduction of uridines in tRNA transcripts. Despite its abundance, no enzymes that catalyze D-formation have been identified. Using comparative genomics and computational methods we have identified members of the cluster of orthologous genes, COG0042, as putative dihydrouridine synthase encoding genes. Escherichia coli contains three COG0042 family members (yjbN, yhdG, andyohI). Strains were created where one, two, or all three of the COG0042 genes were deleted. Purified tRNA samples were investigated from the three single and the three double knockout strains, as well as from the triple deletion strain. The results showed that the COG0042 gene family is responsible for tRNA-dihydrouridine synthase activity inE. coli. They also suggest that the COG0042-encoded family members act site-specifically on the tRNA D-loop and contain non-redundant catalytic functions in vivo. 5,6-Dihydrouridine (D) is a modified base found abundantly in the D-loops of tRNA from Archaea, Bacteria, and Eukarya.

Horn C. Brown M. Ioudovitch A. Steinberg S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 148-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar). This non-aromatic base is found almost exclusively at conserved positions in the D-loop (Fig. 1 A) (1Sprinzl M. Horn C. Brown M. Ioudovitch A. Steinberg S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 148-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar). The tRNA ofEscherichia coli contains up to four D residues with the vast majority containing at least one D. (Only tRNATyr and tRNAGlu do not contain D.) Additionally, D has been found at position 2449 of the E. coli 23 S rRNA (2Kowalak J.A. Bruenger E. McCloskey J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17758-17764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Despite the widespread occurrence of this non-aromatic base, little is known about its biochemical roles. Evidence that dihydrouridine may destabilize the structure and thus enhance conformational flexibility of tRNA was presented by McCloskey and coworkers (3Dalluge J.J. Hashizume T. Sopchik A.E. McCloskey J.A. Davis D.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 1073-1079Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). They showed that a short D-containing oligonucleotide favors the C2′-endoribose conformation as compared with the equivalent U-containing oligonucleotide that favors the C3′-endo conformation. The C3′-endo conformation is necessary for base-stacked RNA. The same group argued that thermophilic organisms generally possess lower levels of D in their tRNA because of the lesser need for inherent tRNA conformational flexibility at high growth temperatures (4Dalluge J.J. Hamamoto T. Horikoshi K. Morita R.Y. Stetter K.O. McCloskey J.A. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 1918-1923Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Despite the abundance of D in tRNA of prokaryotes and eukaryotes, the genes encoding the enzymes for dihydrouridine synthesis have not been identified. Aware that D occurs in specific positions in the D-loop and that different tRNA from the same organism contain varying amounts of D, we hypothesized that prokaryote and eukaryote genomes encoded more than one enzyme and that their substrate specificities were distinct. However, without genetic selections or screens that utilize in vivo phenotypes, identifying the gene(s) responsible for dihydrouridine synthesis has been difficult. To address this problem in a new way, we took advantage of the growing number of complete genomic data bases. To reduce the number of possible candidates, we used computational algorithms to identify genes that are specific to organisms that synthesize dihydrouridine. This approach ultimately narrowed down the candidates to three E. coli genes encoding putative DUS activity. Their associated biochemical phenotypes were investigated.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESStrains and Growth ConditionsBacteria were routinely grown in mineral standard (MS) medium (5Richaud C.

For the construction ofyjbN::Cmr , attempts were performed both in KM44 and JC8679. Cmr clones took 8 to 10 days to appear on selection plates. Selected clones were tested by PCR for insertion of the correct locus. Two independent clones were kept for further studies.

Iterative P1 transductions were performed to generate double and triple deletion DUS strains.Expression and Purification of Total tRNAE. coli strains were grown in 2 liters of LB supplemented with the appropriate antibiotics and harvested during late-log phase growth (OD600 ∼0.6–0.8). Frozen cell pellets were resuspended in 20 ml of resuspension buffer (0.3m NaOAc, 10 mm EDTA, pH 5.2) and extracted with buffer-saturated phenol (pH 4.3, Sigma). The aqueous layer was collected, and the RNA was precipitated with ethanol. The tRNA was purified on a Nucleobond AX-500 column (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol.Expression and Purification of tRN A2fMetWild-type and DUS deletion strains were transformed with the tRNA2fMet-encoding plasmid pUCtRNFM (16Seong B.L. RajBhandary U.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 334-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Ampicillin-resistant colonies were isolated and grown to late-log phase. Total tRNA was isolated as described above. The tRNA samples (∼3 mg) were fractionated on a C4 column (Vydac, Hesperia, CA) at a 0.5-ml/min flow rate with the following gradient: 0–5 min, 0% Buffer B; 5–15 min, 0–50% Buffer B; 15–75 min, 50–100% Buffer B, 75–90 min, 100% Buffer B. (HPLC Buffer A: 50 mm MES, pH 6.5, 1.5 m(NH4)2 SO4, 0.75% 2-propyl alcohol; HPLC Buffer B: 50 mm MES, pH 6.5, 0.75% 2-propyl alcohol.) The overexpressed peak (elution time ∼76–78 min) was collected and concentrated. The HPLC-purified tRNA2fMet was then loaded on a 12% polyacrylamide gel in 0.5× Tris borate/EDTA buffer and run until the bromphenol blue dye eluted from the gel. The major, fastest running band, tRNA2fMet (16Seong B.L. RajBhandary U.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 334-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) was excised from the gel and crushed and soaked in 0.5 mNH4OAc, 1 mm EDTA, pH 5.4. The eluted tRNA2fMet was ethanol-precipitated and redissolved in water.Assay for tRNA Dihydrouridine ContentColorimetric measurement of tRNA D content was performed by the method of Jacobson and Hedgcoth (17Jacobson M. Hedgcoth C. Anal. Biochem. 1970; 34: 459-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar).N-phenyl-p-phenylenediamine and 2,3-butadione monoxime solutions were prepared as described by Hunninghake and Grisolia (18Hunninghake D. Grisolia S. Anal. Biochem. 1966; 16: 200-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), except that the free baseN-phenyl-p-phenylenediamine (Aldrich) was used instead of the hydrochloride salt.DISCUSSIONAlthough the widespread presence of D in tRNA has been known for decades (33Madison J.T. Holley R.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1965; 18: 153Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), the activity of a DUS enzyme has not been previously identified. Here we have shown that a widely distributed but previously uncharacterized gene family, COG0042, is responsible for the formation of D in the D-loops of tRNA. These genes are predicted to encode a family of FMN-binding α/β barrels based on their homology to DHODH and DHPDH. As stated earlier, identification of the gene for DUS by conventional methods is inherently difficult. By using comparative genomics to guide genetic and biochemical experiments, we were able to overcome technical pitfalls. Approaches similar to those used here will be useful for assigning functions to other gene families of unknown function. This is particularly true for genes that control post-transcriptional or post-translational modifications, because the products of these reactions are usually characterized prior to the identification of the modification enzymes.Based on the chemical similarities of the catalyzed reactions, it is perhaps not surprising that comparative genomics yielded a candidate gene family that bears structural resemblance to DHODH and DHPDH. However, COG0042 contains no known RNA-binding domains and is not predicted to interact with RNA in annotated genomic data bases. This raises the question whether COG0042 gene products specifically recognize the D-loop of tRNA or whether they must associate with an RNA-binding protein. Although few proteins are known to bind to the D-loop of tRNA (34Swairjo M.A. Morales A.J. Wang C.C. Ortiz A.R. Schimmel P. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6287-6298Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 35Nomanbhoy T. Morales A.J. Abraham A.T. Vortler C.S. Giege R. Schimmel P. Nat. Struct.

A. 2001; 98: 13473-13475Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), preliminary studies suggest that purifiedE. coli YhdG binds the D-loop in vitro. 4A. C. Bishop and P. Schimmel, unpublished results.Finally, all of the data presented in this study center around the DUS from E. coli. The available genomic and biochemical information shows that the patterns and degrees of D modification vary substantially from organism to organism. For example, tRNATrp in E. coli contains three Ds whereas tRNATrp from B. subtilis contains only one. Likewise, D-containing organisms can contain one (A. aeolicus), two (B. subtilis), three (E. coli), or even four (S. cerevisiae) DUS. Therefore, each organism may contain a unique pattern of positional specificity for its set of DUS.Note Added in ProofA recent report has described the identification of the equivalent DihydroUridine Synthase family inS. cerevisiae (Xing, F., Martzen, M. R., and Phizicky, E. M. (2002) RNA 8, 370–381). These authors gave this gene family the “dus” acronym. In accordance with this precedent, theyjbN, yhdG, and yohI genes have been named dusA, dusB, and dusC, respectively, in the E. coli Genetic Stock Center database (cgsc.biology.yale.edu/cgsc.html). 5,6-Dihydrouridine (D)1is the most abundant modified base in prokaryote and eukaryote tRNA (1Sprinzl M. Horn C. Brown M. Ioudovitch A. Steinberg S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 148-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar). This non-aromatic base is found almost exclusively at conserved positions in the D-loop (Fig. 1 A) (1Sprinzl M. Horn C. Brown M. Ioudovitch A. Steinberg S.

Iterative P1 transductions were performed to generate double and triple deletion DUS strains.Expression and Purification of Total tRNAE. coli strains were grown in 2 liters of LB supplemented with the appropriate antibiotics and harvested during late-log phase growth (OD600 ∼0.6–0.8). Frozen cell pellets were resuspended in 20 ml of resuspension buffer (0.3m NaOAc, 10 mm EDTA, pH 5.2) and extracted with buffer-saturated phenol (pH 4.3, Sigma). The aqueous layer was collected, and the RNA was precipitated with ethanol. The tRNA was purified on a Nucleobond AX-500 column (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol.Expression and Purification of tRN A2fMetWild-type and DUS deletion strains were transformed with the tRNA2fMet-encoding plasmid pUCtRNFM (16Seong B.L.

Total tRNA was isolated as described above. The tRNA samples (∼3 mg) were fractionated on a C4 column (Vydac, Hesperia, CA) at a 0.5-ml/min flow rate with the following gradient: 0–5 min, 0% Buffer B; 5–15 min, 0–50% Buffer B; 15–75 min, 50–100% Buffer B, 75–90 min, 100% Buffer B.

The overexpressed peak (elution time ∼76–78 min) was collected and concentrated. The HPLC-purified tRNA2fMet was then loaded on a 12% polyacrylamide gel in 0.5× Tris borate/EDTA buffer and run until the bromphenol blue dye eluted from the gel.

https://openalex.org/W2169965373,"We examined the capacity of mouse glomerular mesangial cells (MC) to express and function through two different low affinity FcγRs, the activating FcγRIII and the inhibitory FcγRII. Immunohistochemistry identified FcγRII as the prominent FcγR in the kidney, and low levels of FcγRIIb2-specific mRNA were also detected in primary cultures of growth-arrested MC. Activation by tumor necrosis factor-α/interleukin-1β induced substantial FcγRII expression in proliferating MC. Importantly, however, stimulation with interferon-γ (IFN-γ)/lipopolysaccharide or IFN-γ alone resulted in a complete down-regulation of FcγRII, which was accompanied by a strong increase in FcRγ chain mRNA and a surface appearance of FcγRIII. Activating FcγRIII triggered mRNA synthesis for monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), MCP-5, cytokine-induced neutrophil chemoattractant, and RANTES, whereas FcγRIII-deficient MC failed to respond to immune complex (IC) activation as shown by impaired production of MCP-1 mRNA/protein. In a passive model of acute anti-glomerular basement membrane (GBM) nephritis, induction of FcγRIII and suppression of FcγRII occurred in kidney tissues. Blockade of FcγRII, when induced selectively in the kidney, resulted in enhanced inflammation. Taken together, our results define a novel regulatory pathway with opposite regulation of FcγRII (suppressed) and FcγRIII (induced) by IFN-γ on MCsin vitro and anti-GBM IgG in vivo.

Although it had been assumed for a long time that IC diseases are mediated mainly by complement activation, the mechanisms by which IC formation triggers inflammation are still not fully understood. Spontaneous and induced mouse models of IC-dependent glomerular injury reveal an involvement of various complement components, including C1q, C3, and C5a (5Mitchell D.A. Taylor P.R. Cook H.T. Moss J.

However, studies in FcRγ chain-deficient mice define another potential pathway responsible for kidney damage in autoimmune glomerulonephritis requiring activating Fc receptors for IgG, FcγRs (8Clynes R. Dumitru C. Ravetch J.V. Science. 1998; 279: 1052-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). The demonstration that both FcγRs and complement are essential in the experimental Arthus reaction suggests that the initiation of glomerulonephritis may also depend on the combined action of these two prominent effector systems (9Baumann U.

Three classes of FcγR are known on murine leukocytes: the high affinity receptor, FcγRI, and the low affinity receptors, FcγRII and FcγRIII (12Gessner J.E. Heiken H. Tamm A. Schmidt R.E. Ann. Hematol. 1998; 76: 231-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Activating FcγRI and FcγRIII are expressed in association with the FcRγ chain essential for triggering their various effector functions including antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity, phagocytosis, and the production of proinflammatory molecules (13Takai T., Li, M.

In contrast, the two major isoforms of FcγRII, FcγRIIb1 and FcγRIIb2, apparently lack such activating capacity but can inhibit FcRγ-dependent activation signals when co-expressed on the same effector cell (16Takai T. Ono M. Hikida M. Ohmori H. Ravetch J.V. Nature. 1996; 379: 346-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar). This balance between activating/inhibitory FcγRs has been established in various murine models and is highlighted by an increased susceptibility of FcγRII (−/−) mice to the pathogenic effects of antibodies in IC-triggered inflammation and autoimmune disease (17Clynes R.

Glomerular mesangial cells (MC) are bone marrow-independent mesenchymal cells related to vascular smooth muscle cells (21Floege J. Radeke H.H. Johnson R.J. Kidney Int. 1994; 45: 360-368Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 22Mene P. Simonson M.S. Dunn M.J. Physiol. Rev. 1989; 69: 1347-1424Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). Their contractility controls the rate of glomerular filtration and they are implicated in inflammatory and pathogenic processes of glomerular injury. When activated, MC are able to produce a variety of mediators, including nitric oxide, oxygen radicals, chemotactic cytokines, and several growth factors (23Radeke H.H. Resch K. Clin. Investig. 1992; 70: 825-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 24Radeke H.H. Meier B. Topley N. Floege J. Habermehl G.G. Resch K.

Chem. 1991; 266: 21025-21029Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This is accompanied by the induction of specific receptors, which enable them to form autocrine proliferative loops (26Francki A. Uciechowski P. Floege J. von der Ohe J. Resch K. Radeke H.H. Am. J. Pathol. 1994; 147: 1372-1382Google Scholar). Human MC, which are normally FcγR-negative, can also be stimulated to express the activating receptors, FcγRI and FcγRIII. This induction of functional FcγRs may provide an important mechanism of initiation and progression of chronic glomerular inflammation by immune complexes (27Radeke H.H. Gessner J.E. Uciechowski P. Mägert H.-J. Schmidt R.E. Resch K. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 1281-1292PubMed Google Scholar, 28Uciechowski P. Schwarz M. Gessner J.E. Schmidt R.E. Resch K. Radeke H.H. Eur. J. Immunol. 1998; 28: 2928-2935Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In the present study, we examined the capacity of mouse glomerular MC to express individual FcγRs by using primary cultures of MC established from normal and FcR-deficient mice. Moreover, we analyzed the role of the cytokines IFN-γ, TNFα, and IL-1β in the induction and/or down-regulation of the low affinity receptors FcγRII and FcγRIII on MC and in the IC/FcγRIII-dependent generation of various proinflammatory mediators known to be involved in the pathogenesis of glomerulonephritis. By using this strategy, we first identified the b2 isoform of FcγRII to be expressed on resting MC and normal kidney tissue. Second, we showed a requirement of IFN-γ in changing the expression profile from inhibitory FcγRII to activating FcγRIII. Third, the induction of activating FcγRIII on proliferating MC and the subsequent interaction with ICs triggered the enhanced synthesis of chemoattractants, including CC and CXC subfamily chemokines RANTES, MCP-1, MCP-5, and KC, respectively. Given the established function of these chemokines in renal IC inflammation (29Moore K.J. Wada T. Barbee S.D. Kelly V.R. Kidney Int. 1998; 53: 1631-1641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 30Luo Y. Lloyd C. Gutierrez-Ramos J.-C. Dorf M.E. J.

Nephrol. 2001; 12: 919-931PubMed Google Scholar), alterations in the levels of locally expressed inhibitory and activating FcγRs might be of pathogenic importance in glomerular disease in mice. This was verified in an experimental model of acute anti-GBM nephritis in which early renal mediator production and recruitment of neutrophils correlated with suppression of FcγRII and induction of glomerular FcγRIII. Moreover, the finding of increased MCP-1, MIP-2, and KC levels and augmented neutrophil influx upon local FcγRII-blockade suggested that the function of the inhibitory FcγRII and its down-regulation on mesangial cells during inflammation is critical in kidney pathology. The generation of FcγRII (−/−), FcγRIII (−/−) and FcRγ (−/−) mice derived from embryonic stem cells with 129 origin and back-crossed for 8–12 generations with C57BL/6 mice has been described previously (13Takai T., Li, M.

C57BL/6 mice were obtained from Charles River Laboratories (Sulzfeld, Germany). All these mice were used at 14–18 weeks of age for immunohistochemical analysis of kidney tissues (see below). All animal experiments were conducted in accordance with the regulations of the local authorities. To analyze the expression of individual FcγRs within the glomerulus, kidney tissue of FcγR-deficient and C57BL/6 mice treated or not with increasing doses (50–500 ng) of intraperitonealEscherichia coli LPS (Sigma) were processed for histological examination by immunocytochemical techniques as described (18Schiller C.

FcγR-positive staining was determined by incubating cryostat sections for 30 min with the anti-FcγRII/III mAb 2.4G2 followed by incubation with the bridging antibody (Z0494) and the rat-APAAP antibody complex (D0488) for 30 min. The last two steps were repeated for 15 min followed by visualization using a Fast Red detection kit (Dako). All slides were counterstained with hematoxylin and mounted in Glycergel (Dako). Glomerular mesangial cells from C57BL/6 wild-type, FcγRIII-deficient, and FcRγ-deficient mice were prepared, characterized, and cultured according to the protocol described (23Radeke H.H. Resch K. Clin. Investig. 1992; 70: 825-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 33Radeke H.H. Emmendorffer A. Uciechowski P. von der Ohe J. Schwinzer B. Resch K. Kidney Int. 1994; 45: 763-774Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). For each of the three independent preparations, 12 mouse kidneys were pooled. The kidneys were dissected from 6-week-old mice; the capsule and medulla were removed and the cortex cut into slices and rinsed. The material was sequentially pushed through 125- and 180-μm stainless steel sieves. The glomeruli separate from tubuli and Bowman capsules were recovered in a sieve with a 60-μm mesh screen and washed. By this procedure we obtained microscopically 95% pure, decapsulated glomeruli free of tubular contamination. These steps were followed by digestion with collagenase (1 mg/ml, type CLS4, 184 units/mg (Worthington)) for 30 min at 37 °C with shaking of the mixture every 5 min. After two washing cycles the digested glomeruli were seeded in 25-cm2 plastic culture flasks (Nunc) in a low volume (2 ml) of culture medium (see below) with 20% FCS to permit adherence. These conditions resulted in a predominantly mesangial outgrowth starting at day 6–12. Cells not resembling the typical growth in interwoven bundles were scraped off and removed together with the glomerular debris by gentle washing with fresh medium. Cells were then grown to confluence and switched to 10% FCS culture medium between the second and third passage. Morphologically uniform cultures of stellate mesangial cells were used for characterization between the second and 12th passage. Light microscopic evaluation showed one layer of this cell type, with cell-cell contacts at discreet cell regions in a three-dimensional fashion resembling a net-like structure. Intercellular junctions were starting points for intracellular fibers, which by indirect immunofluorescence stained positively for myosin (see below). In mouse MC cultures extracellular matrix and “hillocks” (23Radeke H.H. Resch K. Clin. Investig. 1992; 70: 825-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 25Radeke H.H. Cross A.R. Hancock J.T.

There was no morphological evidence of the presence of macrophages, dendrite-, endothelial-, or epithelial-like cells, or fibroblasts. However, to confirm the presence of exclusively intrinsic mouse mesangial cells of mesodermal origin we performed a series of biochemical, immune cytochemical, and functional tests. Briefly, these cells were resistant to puromycin treatment (10 μg/ml, 24 h), sensitive to mitomycin (10 μg/ml, 24 h). They stained positive by an indirect immunofluorescence technique for smooth muscle myosin, desmin, fibronectin, vimentin, and mouse MHC I antigen; and at confluence, they stained positive for extracellular deposits of collagen type IV and negative for factor VIII and cytokeratin. After the second passage, both dendritic cells and macrophages, which may represent 3–5% of glomerular cells in vivo, were carefully excluded as a contaminating subpopulation in MC cultures. Repeated MHC II antigen determinations with nonstimulated MC adherent on slides (with and without fixation) or flow cytometry (FACS) of suspended MC with anti-mouse I-Ad antibodies up to passage 12 were negative. Additionally, we did not detect any interferon activity in the MC supernatant, which might have been due to dendritic cells. Mouse MC used in passages 6–12 were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with non-essential amino acids (1%),l-glutamine (2 mm), sodium pyruvate (2 mm), bovine insulin (5 μg/ml), β-mercaptoethanol (45 μm), and endotoxin-free FCS (10%). Serum-free culture of mouse MC was performed using MCDB-302 medium (Sigma) with the supplements mentioned above, but without FCS, leading to growth arrest of MC after 48–72 h. Mouse macrophage J774 cells were used as control cells and cultured under standard conditions. All cell types were free of any mycoplasma contamination as tested every second week by a highly sensitive PCR analysis using previously established protocols (27Radeke H.H. Gessner J.E. Uciechowski P. Mägert H.-J. Schmidt R.E. Resch K. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 1281-1292PubMed Google Scholar). For the stimulating conditions for mouse MC, we used incubations for 48 h with the following concentrations of the various stimuli: 500–1000 units/ml mIFN-γ (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), 500 units/ml mTNFα (Phillips, Bissendorf, Germany), 10 ng/ml recombinant human IL-1β (Hoffmann-La Roche), 10 ng/ml mIL-10 (TEBU GmbH, Offenbach, Germany), 10 μg/ml E. coli LPS (Sigma). Total cellular RNA was isolated from mouse MC and J774 cells with RNA-Clean (AGS, Heidelberg, Germany) followed by LiCl2precipitation and finally suspended in diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water at a concentration of 1 μg/μl.

The following FcR-recognizing antibodies were used: anti-FcγRII/III (clone 2.4G2, rat anti-mouse IgG) (BD PharMingen, Heidelberg, Germany) and anti-Ly17.2 (clone K9.361, mouse anti-mouse IgG; kindly provided by Dr. U. Hämmerling, Sloan-Kettering Institute, New York), the latter specifically binding the FcγRII antigen (18Schiller C. Janssen-Graalfs I. Baumann U. Schwerter-Strumpf K. Izui S. Takai T. Schmidt R.E. Gessner J.E. Eur. J. Immunol. 2000; 30: 481-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Isotype control mAbs with irrelevant specificities were obtained from Immunotech (Hamburg, Germany). Binding of the mAb to the respective antigens was performed by indirect immunofluorescence. After mild trypsinization, mouse MC (106 cells) were incubated with the first mAb, followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated goat anti-mouse or goat anti-rat IgG F(ab′)2 fragments (Dianova, Hamburg, Germany), and were analyzed on a FACScan flow cytometer (BD PharMingen). Cells were seeded on glass cover slides (8-well; Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark) and grown to subconfluency by covering the slides with 10% FCS medium in 10-cm Petri dishes. After stimulation with 500 units/ml IFN-γ and 10 μg/ml LPS for 48 h, cells were washed twice with PBS, 0.05% Tween, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, fixed for 10 min at −20 °C with acetone/methanol (1:2), followed by three further washes with Tris-buffered saline. Cells were then incubated with monomeric mouse IgG2a at 37 °C for 30 min and phenotyped by the alkaline phosphatase anti-alkaline phosphatase technique (Dako). In functional experiments, mouse MC induced to express or not the activating FcγRIII were further stimulated with 50 μg/ml heat-aggregated IgG according to the methods of Santiago et al. (39Santiago A. Mori T. Satriano J. Schlondorff D. Kidney Int. 1991; 39: 87-94Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) and Hora et al. (40Hora K. Satriano J.A. Santiago A. Mori T.

After 12 h of IgG IC activation, RNA was prepared and analyzed for chemokine mRNA synthesis by RNase protection assay. The culture supernatants were examined for the production of MCP-1. Assays for chemokine mRNA were conducted with the mCK-5 multiprobe template set according to the manufacturer's protocol (RiboQuant assay kit, BD PharMingen). The assay kit allows for the simultaneous detection of mRNA for each of the following mouse chemokines: lymphotactin, RANTES, eotaxin, MIP-1β, MIP-1α, MIP-2, IFN-γ-inducible protein-10 (IP-10), MCP-1, TCA3, and mRNA for the L32 and GAPDH housekeeping genes. Immuno-MaxiSorb 96-well microtiter plates (Nunc, Wiesbaden, Germany) were coated with 100 μl containing 1 μg/ml goat anti-mouse MCP-1 antibody (R&D Systems, Wiesbaden, Germany) in 100 mm sodium carbonate-bicarbonate buffer (pH 9.6) at 4 °C. After removing the excess capture Ab, the wells were filled with 200 μl of 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS and incubated at room temperature for 2 h to saturate excess binding sites. After three washes with PBS, serial dilutions of the experimental samples diluted in 1% bovine serum albumin/PBS were added to the plates and incubated at 4 °C overnight. After three washes, 100 μl of biotinylated detector anti-MCP-1 Ab was added to the wells and incubated for 4 h at room temperature. After three additional washes, the plates were incubated with peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin for 2 h. After three final washes, plates were developed with hydrogen peroxide and tetramethylbenzidine (Sigma) and stopped by the addition of 1 mH2SO4. Titrations of recombinant mouse MCP-1 (R&D Systems) were included in each experiment for standardization. Rabbit anti-mouse glomerular basement membrane (GBM) IgG antiserum was kindly provided by P. Heeringa. After decomplementation by heating at 56 °C for 30 min, 300 μl of anti-GBM antiserum was injected intravenously via the tail vein of ether-anesthetized mice. This concentration was effective to induce significant glomerular neutrophil influx in the early heterologous phase (2–4 h) of acute anti-GBM nephritis (58Schrijver G. Bogman J.J.T.

In some experiments, glomerular FcγRII was selectively blocked (30 min before anti-GBM treatment) by intracapsular injection of the neutralizing anti-FcγRII Ly17.2 mAb (40 μg in 20 μl of sterile PBS) in one of the two kidneys per mouse. Mice were killed at 2 h after initiation of anti-GBM nephritis, and kidneys were assayed for glomerular expression of FcγRs, MCP-1 mRNA/protein production, MIP-2/KC CXC chemokine release, and neutrophil accumulation. The levels of FcγR and MCP-1 mRNA in kidneys normalized to tubulin were quantitated by TaqMan real-time PCR using the following FcγRII-, FcγRIII-, MCP-1-, and β-tubulin-specific primers and probes (FcγRII: sense, 5′-AGTCTCCCTTGGCATTGGG-3′, antisense, 5′-AGCATCCCTTGGACCAGGA-3′, probe, 6-FAM-AAAGCAAGCCAGAAAGGCCAGGATCTAGT-TAMRA; F"

We have determined that angiotensin II (Ang II) stimulates plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) synthesis and secretion in human trophoblasts in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. Our results indicate that Ang II activates PAI-1gene expression through the AT1 receptor and involves the calcium-dependent activation of calcineurin and the nuclear translocation of NFAT. Increased PAI-1 synthesis and secretion is associated with reduced trophoblast invasion as judged by an in vitro invasion assay.

A key component of this system is plasminogen, an inactive zymogen, which is converted into the active protease, plasmin, by the action of a plasminogen activator termed tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA).1 The ability of tPA to activate plasminogen is substantially enhanced by its association with the substrate, fibrin (1Vassalli J.D. Sappino A.P. Belin D. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 88: 1067-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (1095) Google Scholar). Plasminogen can also be activated (i.e. converted to plasmin) by the action of another plasminogen activator, urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) (2Blasi F. Vassalli J.D. Dano K. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 104: 801-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar, 3Carmeliet P. Moons L. Herbert J.M. Crawley J. Lupu F. Lijnen R. Collen D. Circ.

Rifkin D.B. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1988; 4: 93-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar). In contrast to tPA, uPA is not associated with fibrin clots but instead is often associated with a specific cell surface receptor (uPAR) (7Blasi F. Behrendt N. Cubellis M.V. Ellis V. Lund L.R. Masucci M.T. Moller L.B. Olson D.P. Pedersen N. Ploug M. et al.Cell Differ. Dev. 1990; 32: 247-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), which is thought to play a key role in cell migration and invasion (8Kwaan H.C. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1992; 11: 291-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). In this role, uPA is synthesized as an inactive single-chain proenzyme that can be stored or secreted. Secreted uPA is cleaved into the active two-chain molecule upon binding to uPAR on the surface of cells. Following activation, receptor-bound uPA is capable of converting plasminogen into plasmin, the latter of which is able to degrade several key components of the extracellular matrix (ECM) (9Ellis V. Dano K. Semin. Thromb. Hemost. 1991; 17: 194-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). It is widely accepted that uPA initiates a cascade of proteolysis at the cell surface, which in turn leads to the degradation of the ECM, thereby promoting cellular migration. It is now clear that the uPA-regulated aspect of the fibrinolytic system plays a key role in mediating ECM degradation and cell invasion. Plasminogen activator activity is controlled by plasminogen activator inhibitors (PAIs) of which PAI-1 is the predominant physiological inhibitor (1Vassalli J.D. Sappino A.P. Belin D. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 88: 1067-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (1095) Google Scholar, 10Chapman H.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 714-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar, 11Waltz D.A. Natkin L.R. Fujita R.M. Wei Y. Chapman H.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 58-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). PAI-1 is an ECM glycoprotein that is capable of inhibiting both free and receptor-bound uPA through the formation of an irreversible covalent complex (12Ellis V. Wun T.C. Behrendt N. Ronne E. Dano K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9904-9908Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this way PAI-1 is believed to control cell migration and invasion in tumor growth and angiogenesis (13Pedersen H.

Numerous studies suggest that PAI-1 production by human trophoblasts plays an important role in trophoblast invasion and placental development (17Strickland S. Reich E. Sherman M.I.

The human hemochorial placenta is a highly invasive structure in which a subpopulation of placental trophoblast cells invades the uterus, its underlying stroma, and local blood vessels to achieve a physiological union between maternal and fetal circulatory systems (19Graham C.H. Lala P.K. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1992; 70: 867-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Plasminogen activators and plasminogen activator inhibitors are believed to regulate trophoblast invasion of the uterus. Key players in this process include uPA, PAI-1, and PAI-2 that together govern the production of plasmin from circulating plasminogen (20Queenan J.T., Jr. Kao L.C. Arboleda C.E. Ulloa-Aguirre A.

Renin, angiotensinogen, angiotensin-converting enzyme, and angiotensin receptors are all present in the human placenta, suggesting that angiotensin II (Ang II) synthesized in the placenta may serve as a local modulator of placental function (32Poisner A.M.

Obstet. 1996; 55: 135-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), the direct correlation of the RAS with PAI-1 production during human pregnancy is not well studied. We show here that Ang II stimulates PAI-1 synthesis and secretion in human trophoblasts in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. Our results indicate that Ang II activates PAI-1 gene expression through the AT1 receptor and involves the calcium-dependent activation of the phosphatase, calcineurin, and the nuclear translocation of the transcription factor, nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT). We show that increased PAI-1 synthesis and secretion result in reduced trophoblast invasion as judged by an in vitro Matrigel invasion assay. These studies are the first to link the renin-angiotensin system with the fibrinolytic system to regulate trophoblast invasion. Tissue culture medium, fetal bovine serum, antibiotic-antimycotic (100×), Superscript II RNase H reverse transcriptase, Platinum Taq DNA polymerase, and a total RNA isolation kit were purchased from Invitrogen (Grand Island, NY). The PAI-1 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit was obtained from American Diagnostic, Inc. (Greenwich, CT). The nylon membranes used in RNA transfer were from Bio-Rad Laboratories (Hercules, CA). Radiochemicals were obtained from ICN Radiochemicals (Irvine, CA). BD Biocoat Matrigel invasion chambers and control inserts were obtained from Becton Dickinson Labware (Bedford, MA). Ang II and bovine calf serum were obtained from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO). Polyclonal antibodies specific for human PAI-1, AT1, and β-actin were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnologies (Santa Cruz, CA). Losartan and prazosin were generous gifts from Merck Sharp and Dohme (Rahway, NJ). The HTR-8/SVneo trophoblast cell line (a kind gift from Dr. Charles H. Graham, Queen's University, Ontario, Canada) was established from explant cultures of human first trimester placentas and immortalized by transfection with the gene encoding simian virus 40 large T antigen, as previously described (37Graham C.H. Lala P.K. J. Cell. Physiol. 1991; 148: 228-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). These cells exhibit a high proliferation index and share phenotypic similarities with the non-transfected parent HTR-8 cells, including in vitroinvasive ability and lack of tumorigenicity in nude mice. Furthermore, the parent cell population has also been shown to express a variety of other markers characteristic of extravillous invasive trophoblastsin situ (37Graham C.H. Lala P.K. J. Cell. Physiol. 1991; 148: 228-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). HTR-8/SVneo trophoblasts were plated in 6-well dishes in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum at a plating density of 0.5 × 105 cells per well. After 24 h, the serum-containing medium was removed, and the cells were washed and subsequently maintained in serum-free RPMI 1640, containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin (fraction V) for 2 h and then stimulated with 0, 10, 50, and 100 nm Ang II for 24 h. Other cells were treated with 100 nm Ang II for 0, 24, and 48 h, respectively, for time-dependent studies. In some experiments, losartan, prazosin, and cyclosporin A (CSA), at 1 μm, were added to the Ang II (100 nm)-stimulated cells at the initiation of Ang II treatment. Total RNA was isolated using an RNA Isolation Kit (Trizon) at the indicated times from control or Ang II-stimulated cells. For Northern analysis, 10 μg of total RNA was fractionated by electrophoresis on 1% agarose gels containing 0.6% formaldehyde at 50 V for 3 h. Fractionated RNA was transferred onto a Duralon-UV nitrocellulose membrane by capillary action overnight. After blotting, the RNA was cross-linked to the filter by UV irradiation. Following prehybridization (50% formamide, 25 mm potassium phosphate, 5× SSC, 5× Denhardt's solution, and 100 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA) overnight at 42 °C, the blot was hybridized in the prehybridization solution plus 1% dextran sulfate and the labeled DNA fragment. After washing, the blots were visualized by autoradiography following storage at −70 °C for various times. The nucleotide sequence of the oligonucleotides used to generate the cDNA probe for human PAI-1 mRNA was as follows: P1 5′-AGGATGCAGATGTCTCCAGC-3′ and P2 5′-GGTTCCATCACTTGGCCCAT-3′. The probe was obtained using total RNA from HTR-8/Svneo trophoblast cells by Superscript II RNase H reverse transcriptase and PlatinumTaq DNA polymerase. The cDNA probe was sequenced by the dideoxy-mediated chain termination method, and sequence analysis was performed using the Genetics computer group sequence analysis package, version 7.2 (University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI). Cellular protein was suspended in 0.1 ml of lysis buffer containing 0.9% NaCl, 0.2% SDS, 4 mm Tris-HCl with proteinase inhibitors phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (40 μg) and leupeptin (5 μg) on ice and then centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 5 min. The supernatant (50–100 μg of protein) was denatured in sample buffer and electrophoresed at 100 V on 10% polyacrylamide SDS-denaturing gels for 1 h. The separated proteins were transferred from gels onto nitrocellulose membranes at 100 V for 1 h. The blot was blocked with 5% milk in TBST (0.05% Tween-20 in Tris-buffered saline) solution for 1 h at room temperature and then incubated with polyclonal rabbit antibodies to human renin, PAI-1, or β-actin at 1:1500 dilution in 1% milk in TBST for 1 h at room temperature followed by three 15-min washes in TBST. Finally, the blot was incubated with goat anti-rabbit IgG at 1:2000 dilution in 1% milk-TBST for 1 h at room temperature. Rabbit antibody was detected by an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (AmershamBiosciences, ECL blotting system). The secreted PAI-1 concentration was detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) as previously described (30Feener E.P. Northrup J.M. Aiello L.P. King G.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 1353-1362Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Plasmids used to express NFAT-GFP and ΔNFAT-GFP were constructed in pEGFP-1 (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) and were generous gifts from Dr. R. Sanders Williams (Duke University, Durham, NC). The expression constructs pCMV-NFAT and pCMV-ΔNFAT were digested byAgeI and NotI to release the GFP fragment. The correct size fragments of CMV-ΔNFAT and CMV-NFAT were isolated and purified from the gel, blunt-ended, and self-ligated as described before (38Xia Y. McMillin J.B. Lewis A. Moore M. Zhu W.G. Williams R.S. Kellems R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1855-1863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). HTR-8/SVneo trophoblast cells were cultured and transfected with pCMV-NFAT and pCMV-ΔNFAT plasmid (2 μg) in the absence of Ang II. The pCMVlacZ plasmid (2 μg) was used as an internal control to monitor transfection efficiency. After 48 h, the cellular extract was isolated, and Western blot analysis was performed to detect PAI-1 protein production using rabbit polyclonal anti human PAI-1 antibody as describe before (39Xia Y. Wen H. Prashner H.R. Chen R. Inagami T. Catanzaro D.F. Kellems R.E. Biol. Reprod. 2002; 66: 135-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). For cells expressing the NFAT-GFP fusion protein, HTR-8/SVneo human trophoblasts were cultured on laminin-coated (10 μg) glass coverslips inserted into the multiwell dishes. After 24 h cells were transfected with 2 μg of NFAT-GFP construct and 6 h later washed twice with PBS. Half of the cells were treated by 100 nm Ang II for 48 h, and half were maintained under the same conditions in the absence of Ang II. After 48 h all cells were washed with 1× PBS, and the cells on the coverslips were viewed using an Olympus BX 60 fluorescence microscope equipped with darkfield optics with a green filter and photographed using a SPOT digital camera (Diagnostics Instruments Inc., Sterling Height, MI). Invasiveness of HTR-8/SVneo was measured with a Matrigel Invasion Chamber (Becton Dickinson Labware, Bedford, MA) as described before (40Lala P.K. Graham C.H. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1990; 9: 369-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Briefly, confluent cells were harvested with 0.25% trypsin and 0.2% EDTA then centrifuged at 800 × g for 10 min. Cells were washed with 1× phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) once and resuspended in RPMI 1640 containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin. The lower compartment of the invasion chamber was filled with RPMI 1640 containing 5% fetal bovine serum as chemoattractant. The lower compartment was overlaid with an 8-μm pore size polyethylene phthalate membrane precoated with Matrigel basement membrane matrix at 125 μg/cm2. The cells (2.5 × 105 per 6-well plate) were seeded in the upper compartment of the prehydrated Matrigel-coated invasion chambers in the absence or presence of Ang II. The control insert chambers contained 8-μm pore size polyethylene phthalate membrane without being precoated with Matrigel basement membrane were seeded at the same concentration of cells and treated the same as the invasion chamber. Percent invasion is expressed as the percent invasion through the Matrigel matrix-coated membrane relative to cell migration through the control membrane. The upper surface of the filter was scraped with moist cotton swabs to remove Matrigel and non-migrated cells. Then both the control insert membranes, which were not precoated with Matrigel, and the Matrigel-coated insert membrane were stained with Diff-Quick stain (Biochemical Sciences Inc., Swedesboro, NJ) for 3 min. The membranes were washed three times with water, and the cells in the membranes were viewed by using an Olympus BX 60 fluorescence microscope equipped with brightfield optics and photographed using a SPOT digital camera (Diagnostics Instruments Inc., Sterling Height, MI). In some experiments, losartan (1 μm), CSA (1 μm), and human anti-PAI-1 antibody (1:100) were added to the cells at the initiation of Ang II treatment. All values are expressed as mean ± S.E. Data were analyzed for statistical significance using GraphPad Prism software. Statistical significance was determined by analysis of variance test. A value of p < 0.05 was interpreted to mean that observed experimental differences were statistically significant. Because of the potentially important role of PAI-1 in regulating trophoblast invasion, it is important to identify signal transduction pathways regulating PAI-1 gene expression. Realizing that the maternal fetal interface has a locally active renin-angiotensin system (32Poisner A.M. Front. Neuroendocrinol. 1998; 19: 232-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 41Skinner S.L. Lumbers E.R. Symonds E.M. Clin. Sci. 1972; 42: 479-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) and that PAI-1 gene expression is regulated by Ang II in other systems (25Nakamura S. Nakamura I., Ma, L. Vaughan D.E. Fogo A.B.

Diabetologia. 2001; 44: 713-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) we conducted experiments to determine if the abundance of PAI-1mRNA is induced by Ang II in human trophoblasts. For these studies we used HTR-8/Svneo cells, an immortalized line of human trophoblasts. These cells were incubated with different concentrations of Ang II for 24 h, total RNA was prepared, and the abundance ofPAI-1 mRNA was determined by Northern blot analysis. A typical result is shown in Fig.1 A and indicates thatPAI-1 mRNA abundance increased in response to increasing concentrations of Ang II. Desitometric analysis of PAI-1mRNA hybridization signals from repeated experiments, normalized to those for 28 S rRNA, demonstrated that PAI-1 mRNA levels were 1.1-, 2.2-, and 3.2-fold that of control untreated cells at 10, 50, and 100 nm, respectively (Fig. 1 A). To determine the kinetics of Ang II-induced PAI-1 mRNA abundance, we treated human trophoblast cells with 100 nmAng II for 24 and 48 h. Northern analysis was used to determinePAI-1 mRNA abundance in the presence and absence of Ang II for each time point. The results showed that PAI-1mRNA is induced in response to Ang II treatment and is higher at 48 h than at 24 h of treatment (Fig. 1 B). Densitometric analysis of PAI-1 hybridization signals from repeated experiments, normalized to those of 28 S rRNA, demonstrated thatPAI-1 mRNA levels in Ang II-treated cells were 2.9- and 3.6-fold greater than those of the control cells without Ang II treatment at 24 and 48 h, respectively (Fig. 1 D). These studies are the first to link the renin-angiotensin system with the fibrinolytic system in trophoblasts. We next wished to determine the impact of Ang II on the abundance and secretion of PAI-1 protein by human trophoblasts. For these experiments cells were incubated with increasing concentrations of Ang II for 24 h, and the abundance of PAI-1 in cell extracts was determined by Western blotting. PAI-1 protein from cell extracts was detected as a single band of ∼52 kDa (Fig.2 A). Densitometric analyses of the specific bands from repeated experiments, normalized to that of β-actin, demonstrated that PAI-1 protein levels were 1.1-, 1.9-, and 3.1-fold that of control untreated cells at 10, 50, and 100 nm, respectively (Fig. 2 A). Incubation of cells with 100 nm Ang II for 24 and 48 h resulted in a 2.7- and 3.6-fold increase in the abundance of PAI-1 protein over that of untreated cells, respectively (Fig. 2 B). The increased abundance of PAI-1 protein in cells following incubation with Ang II treatment was consistent with the increase in PAI-1 mRNA abundance following Ang II treatment. PAI-1 protein presumably exerts its physiological effects following secretion from cells where it is associated with plasminogen activators such as uPA (42Burgle M. Koppitz M. Riemer C. Kessler H. Konig B. Weidle U.H. Kellermann J. Lottspeich F. Graeff H. Schmitt M. Goretzki L. Reuning U. Wilhelm O. Magdolen V. Biol. Chem. 1997; 378: 231-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). To determine the effect of Ang II on the secretion of PAI-1, we determined the concentration of PAI-1 in cell culture medium following 24 h of incubation with 100 nm Ang II. The concentration of PAI-1 in cell culture medium was determined using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) specific for human PAI-1. The results (Fig. 2 C) show that the concentration of PAI-1 in cell culture fluid increased ∼2.5-fold in response to 24-h incubation with 100 nm Ang II. These findings show that trophoblasts secrete increased amounts of PAI-1 in response to Ang II treatment. To determine if induction of PAI-1 production is through the AT1 receptor on HTR-8/SVneo cells, losartan, an AT1 receptor antagonist, was used to treat the cells. Treatment with losartan (1 μm) completely prevented PAI-1 mRNA abundance (Fig.3 A), protein synthesis (Fig.3 B), and protein secretion (Fig. 3 C) in response to treatment with 100 nm Ang II. These results indicate that HTR-8/SVneo cells possess the AT1 receptor and thatPAI-1 mRNA abundance and protein synthesis and secretion are enhanced as a result of AT1 receptor activation. Intracellular signaling downstream of AT1 receptor activation in cardiomyocytes involves calcium mobilization and the activation of calcineurin, a calcium/calmodulin-dependent cytoplasmic phosphatase (43Molkentin J.D., Lu, J.R. Antos C.L. Markham B. Richardson J. Robbins J. Grant S.R. Olson E.N. Cell. 1998; 93: 215-228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2197) Google Scholar). To determine if calcineurin is involved in AT1 receptor signaling in human trophoblasts we used the calcineurin inhibitor, CSA. The effect of CSA on Ang II-induced stimulation of PAI-1 gene expression and protein secretion was determined. PAI-1 gene expression was assessed by Northern analysis to determine the abundance of PAI-1 mRNA and by Western analysis to determine the abundance of cellular PAI-1 protein. PAI-1 secretion was quantified by the use of an ELISA to determine the concentration of PAI-1 in cellular fluid following incubation with Ang II. The results show that Ang II induction of PAI-1 mRNA abundance (Fig.4 A), PAI-1 protein abundance (Fig. 4 B), and PAI-1 protein secretion (Fig. 4 C) were consistently inhibited by about 45–55% in the presence of 1 μm CSA. These results indicate that the induction ofPAI-1 gene expression by Ang II is mediated in part through a calcineurin-dependent signaling pathway in human trophoblast cells. NFAT transcription factors translocate from the cytoplasm to the nucleus following dephosphorylation by calcineurin, a Ca2+/calmodulin-activated phosphatase (44Olson E.N. Williams R.S. Cell. 2000; 101: 689-692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Thus, the fact that CSA inhibits the induction of PAI-1 gene expression following Ang II treatment of human trophoblasts suggests that this induction may be mediated, in part, through the action of NFAT. To evaluate this possibility, we transfected a mammalian expression construct encoding a constitutively active NFAT (NFATc), which is known to localize preferentially to the nucleus and in this way mimic the action of dephosphorylated NFAT (38Xia Y. McMillin J.B. Lewis A. Moore M. Zhu W.G. Williams R.S. Kellems R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1855-1863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Transfection of wild type NFAT did not activate PAI-1 gene expression and did not result in an increase in PAI-1 protein concentration. However, transfection of the constitutively active NFATc did result in increased PAI-1 protein levels (Fig. 5 A). These results provide strong evidence that NFAT transcriptional activators are involved in activation of PAI-1 gene expression. Based on the results presented above, we propose that Ang II treatment results in dephosphorylation of NFAT followed by its translocation to the nucleus. To test this hypothesis, we transfected an expression construct encoding an NFAT-GFP fusion protein into control and Ang II-treated human trophoblast cells. After 48 h, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and viewed by fluorescence microscopy to determine the cellular localization of green fluorescence. In control cultures, green fluorescence was cytoplasmic and was excluded from nuclei (Fig. 5 B). However, in Ang II-treated cells, the green fluorescence became concentrated in nuclei in 65% of transfected cells. In control cells, the GFP fluorescence in the transfected cells was only found in the cytosol. These results indicate that human trophoblasts are capable of appropriate compartmentalization of NFAT proteins in the nucleus following Ang II stimulation. Evidence provided above indicates that Ang II induces PAI-1 gene expression and protein secretion. Based on the fact that PAI-1 functions as an inhibitor of plasminogen activators resulting in a decreased degradation of the ECM, we propose that induction of PAI-1 protein synthesis and secretion by Ang II reduces invasiveness of human trophoblast cells. To test this hypothesis, trophoblast invasiveness was measured by an in vitro assay based on the ability of cells to penetrate a Matrigel-coated filter in an invasion chamber over a 24-h period. The ability of the trophoblasts to invade Matrigel-coated membranes is presented relative to the migration of cells through a control membrane that was not coated with Matrigel matrix. Ang II treatment decreased the invasion of the cells by 52% compared with control cells without Ang II treatment (Fig. 6, A,B, and F). To test whether the decr"

The catalase and peroxidase activities of LiP were inhibited within 10 min and those of ARP in 1 h.

Heme Peroxidases. Wiley-VCH, New York1999: 281-308Google Scholar). The plant peroxidases, which share similar overall protein folds and specific features, such as catalytically essential histidine and arginine residues in their active sites, have been subdivided into three classes on the basis of sequence comparison (2Welinder K.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 151: 497-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 3Welinder K.G. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1992; 2: 388-393Crossref Scopus (778) Google Scholar). In class I are intracellular enzymes including yeast cytochrome c peroxidase, ascorbate peroxidase (APX) from plants, and bacterial gene-duplicated catalase-peroxidases (4Welinder K.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1080: 215-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Class III contains the secretory plant peroxidases such as those from horseradish (HRP), barley, or soybean. These peroxidases seem to be biosynthetic enzymes involved in processes such as plant cell wall formation and lignification. Class II consists of the secretory fungal peroxidases such as lignin peroxidase (LiP) from Phanerochaete chrysosporium, manganese peroxidase from the same source, andCoprinus cinereus peroxidase or Arthromyces ramosus peroxidase (ARP), which have been shown to be essentially identical in both sequence and properties (5Kjalke M. Andersen M.B. Schneider P. Christensen B. Schülein M. Welinder K.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1120: 248-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The main role of class II peroxidases appears to be the degradation of lignin in wood. All peroxidases studied so far share much the same catalytic cycle that proceeds in three distinct and essentially irreversible steps (6Dunford H.B. Everse J. Everse K.E. Grisham M.B. Peroxidases in Chemistry and Biology. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1990: 1-24Google Scholar) and is often referred to as the “peroxidase ping-pong.” The resting ferric enzyme reacts with H2O2 in a two-electron process to generate the intermediate known as compound I. Compound I is discharged in two sequential single-electron reactions with reducing substrate yielding radical products, which are often highly reactive, and water. The first reduction step results in the formation of another enzyme intermediate, compound II. In the final step compound II is reduced back to ferric peroxidase. The peroxidase ping-pong provides an adequate description of the peroxidase reaction; however, continuing work has revealed some limitations of the basic model. The compound I reduction steps have been shown to consist of reversible substrate binding followed by substrate oxidation (7Rodrı́guez-López J.N. Gilabert M.A. Tudela J. Thorneley R.N.F. Garcı́a-Cánovas F. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 13201-13209Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The formation and nature of compound I have been studied intensively. Both a neutral peroxidase-peroxide complex and a charged complex (known as compound 0) have been observed (8Rodrı́guez-López J.N. Lowe D.J. Hernández-Ruiz J. Hiner A.N.P. Garcı́a-Cánovas F. Thorneley R.N.F. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 11838-11847Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar), and variations have been identified in the electronic structures of the compound Is of different peroxidases (9Dolphin D.

Furthermore, certain peroxidases have been found to utilize H2O2 to reduce compound I when no other substrate is available. Foremost among the enzymes capable of this are the catalase-peroxidases, which act as highly efficient catalases (kcat/Km ≈ 106m−1 s−1) (15Claiborne A. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 4245-4252Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,16Obinger C. Regelsberger G. Strasser G. Burner U. Peschek G.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 235: 545-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Unexpectedly, APX appears incapable of turnover in the presence of only H2O2 (17Hiner A.N.P. Rodriguez-Lopez J.N. Arnao M.B. Lloyd Raven E. Garcı́a-Cánovas F. Acosta M. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 321-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) despite also being classified in class I. HRP, from class III, has been shown to possess catalase activity, albeit with much lower efficiency (kcat/Km ≈ 102–103m−1s−1) than the catalase-peroxidases (18Hernández-Ruiz J. Arnao M.B. Hiner A.N.P. Garcı́a-Cánovas F. Acosta M. Biochem. J. 2001; 354: 107-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), but to our knowledge, no data are available on catalase activity in class II peroxidases. HRP compound I can also carry out a single-electron reduction of H2O2 to generate compound II and superoxide radical (O2⨪). Reaction of compound II with more H2O2 yields compound III (a complex between ferric peroxidase and O2⨪, also known as oxyperoxidase). Catalase activity and compound III formation result in enzyme turnover in the absence of normal reducing substrates; however, a further reaction with H2O2 has been identified which leads to progressive irreversible enzyme inactivation. In the case of HRP, the complex between compound I and peroxide ([compound I·H2O2]) has been identified unambiguously as the pivotal point connecting the three simultaneous pathways (19Arnao M.B. Acosta M. del Rio J.A. Varón R. Garcı́a-Cánovas F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1041: 43-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar,20Rodriguez-Lopez J.N. Hernández-Ruiz J. Garcı́a-Cánovas F.

Thus, the peroxidase ping-pong mechanism can be replaced by an alternative catalytic cycle (Scheme FSI) when no substrate other than H2O2 is present. Studies on the susceptibility of different peroxidases to H2O2 suggest that all will be sensitive to inactivation to a greater or lesser extent. Even catalase-peroxidase loses activity after repeated exposure to H2O2(21Obinger C. Regelsberger G. Pircher A. Sevcik-Klöckler A. Strasser G. Peschek G.A. Peschek G.A. The Phototrophic Prokaryotes. Kluwer Academic Publishers, New York1999: 719-731Crossref Google Scholar) with inactivation suggested to occur at the level of the [compound I·H2O2] complex. Previous studies on LiP compound III found comparatively facile degradation of the heme by H2O2 (which resulted in loss of activity), but aspects of this process proved rather contentious (22Wariishi H. Gold M.H. FEBS Lett. 1989; 243: 165-168Crossref Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 23Cai D. Tien M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 162: 464-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 24Wariishi H.

Apart from observing catalase activity and compound III formation and inactivation in fungal peroxidases, another important aim of this work was to ascertain whether a model for turnover in the presence of only H2O2 which essentially unifies the behavior of all or most peroxidases may likely exist, just as the peroxidase ping-pong describes activity with reducing substrates even though these substrates can be so varied. We have, therefore, systematically examined the enzymes using a set of experimental procedures that have proved very successful for the determination of the controlling kinetic parameters under such conditions. Further impetus for the present study was provided by the important physiological implications of the reactions of LiP under highly oxidizing conditions and because ARP is a potentially important commercial alternative to HRP. Directed evolution techniques have previously been applied to ARP (39Cherry J.R. Lamsa M.H. Schneider P. Vind J. Svendsen A. Jones A. Pedersen A.H. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 379-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar) to produce an enzyme that is hyperresistant to conditions of high pH, temperature, and H2O2 concentrations. A better understanding of H2O2-dependent turnover and inactivation may point to new strategies to further enhance resistance during applications. Nonglycosylated recombinant LiP isoenzyme H8 (LiP) from P. chrysosporium was expressed in Escherichia coli, and the polypeptide was recovered from inclusion bodies and refolded in vitro in the presence of heme, calcium ions, and glutathione (40Doyle W.A. Smith A.T. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 15-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). After purification the preparation had an RZ (A409 nm/A280 nm) = 1.8 and was homogeneous by SDS-PAGE. Recombinant LiP so far has exhibited behavior identical to that of the natural fungal enzyme (40Doyle W.A. Smith A.T. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 15-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar,41Doyle W.A. Blodig W. Veitch N.C. Piontek K. Smith A.T. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15097-15105Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). ARP (lot 48H0555, RZ (A405 nm/A275 nm) = 2.5) and HRP (type IX, RZ (A403 nm/A275 nm) = 3.2) were obtained from Sigma as lyophilized powders. The HRP preparation has been characterized previously (33Hiner A.N.P. Hernández-Ruiz J. Arnao M.B. Garcı́a-Cánovas F. Acosta M. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 1996; 50: 655-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) by isoelectric focusing as a single band with pI 8.5 and confirmed to be isoenzyme C. ARP was characterized similarly as a single peroxidase band with pI 3.5. Enzyme concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically using ε403 nm = 100 mm−1cm−1 (for HRP-C), ε409 nm = 168 mm−1 cm−1 (for LiP), and ε405 nm = 109 mm−1cm−1 (for ARP). Bovine erythrocyte superoxide dismutase (product code S-2515) was purchased from Sigma as a lyophilized powder containing 4,200 units mg−1. H2O2 (30% by volume) and buffer substances (analytical reagent grade) were obtained from Merck. The concentration of H2O2 was determined using ε240 nm = 43.6 m−1cm−1. ABTS in the form of the crystallized diammonium salt was supplied by Roche Molecular Biochemicals, and its concentration was measured spectrophotometrically using ε340 nm = 36 mm−1 cm−1. Tetranitromethane (TNM) and manganese (II) chloride were from Aldrich. All solutions were prepared using deionized water drawn from a Milli-Q system (Millipore). Oxygen production was measured using a Clark-type electrode coupled to a Hansatech (Kings Lynn, Cambs., UK) CB1D oxygraph unit. The equipment was calibrated using the tyrosinase/4-tert-butylcatechol method (42Rodrı́guez-López J.N. Ros-Martı́nez J.R. Varón R. Garcı́a-Cánovas F. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 202: 356-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The temperature of the reaction chamber was controlled at 25 ± 0.1 °C using a Haake circulating water bath. Nitrogen was bubbled through the reaction medium to remove dissolved oxygen. A base-line rise in oxygen concentration of less than 0.5 μm min−1without enzyme was obtained. The reaction medium (2 ml, total volume) contained H2O2 at the appropriate concentrations (see “Results”) in the following buffers: 50 mm sodium acetate (pH 3.0), 50 mm sodium citrate, (pH 4.5 and 5.5), and 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 6.5, 7.0, and 7.5). The reactions were started by the addition of peroxidase. Additional reagents (Mn2+, TNM, and superoxide dismutase) were added as required. Two types of experiment were performed using the system described. Values ofV0 were determined at short reaction times in the initial linear phase of oxygen production. The initial linear phase lasted ∼10–30 s; departure from linearity at later times indicated that enzyme inactivation was being observed, and such data were therefore not used in calculations. Values ofVmax and Km were obtained by nonlinear regression of a hyperbolic function to a plot ofV0 against [H2O2] using the program SigmaPlot for Windows (version 2, Jandel Scientific Software, San Rafael, CA). These data could be fitted using the Michaelis-Menten equation, which in this case takes the following form (18Hernández-Ruiz J. Arnao M.B. Hiner A.N.P. Garcı́a-Cánovas F. Acosta M. Biochem. J. 2001; 354: 107-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar),d[O2]dt=k3[E]T[H2O2]K2+[H2O2]Equation 1 where Km = K2 andVmax =k3[E]T (thusk3 = kcat), the steps to which k3 and K2 refer being shown in Scheme FSI. The reaction end point was reached when no further O2 production was observed. In all experiments, the final concentration of oxygen produced ([O2]∞) was much less than 0.24 mm (i.e. the oxygen concentration in air-saturated medium at 25 °C). Peroxidase was inactivated at 25 °C in 100-μl incubations in buffers similar to those used in the oxygraph. Each incubation contained 1 μm enzyme and H2O2 at different concentrations (giving the desired [H2O2] to [peroxidase] ratios). When the reaction was complete, the peroxidase activity was measured spectrophotometrically by the increase in the absorbance at 414 nm (ε = 31.1 mm−1 cm−1) in an assay system comprising 10 mm ABTS and 5 mmH2O2 in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.5). The residual enzyme activity (AR) (expressed as percent) was taken as the activity remaining at the end of the reaction (At) compared with the initial activity (A0). Assays were recorded on a PerkinElmer Life Sciences Lambda-2S UV-visible spectrophotometer. The temperature was controlled at 25 ± 0.1 °C using a Haake circulating water bath. The partition ratio (r, the number of turnovers with H2O2 before the enzyme was inactivated;r = (k3 +k4)/ki ≈k3/ki , becausek3 ≫ k4 (18Hernández-Ruiz J. Arnao M.B. Hiner A.N.P. Garcı́a-Cánovas F. Acosta M. Biochem. J. 2001; 354: 107-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar)) was calculated by inserting the value of [H2O2]/[peroxidase] at which %AR = 0 in graphical representations of %AR against [H2O2]/[peroxidase] into Equation 2(18Hernández-Ruiz J. Arnao M.B. Hiner A.N.P. Garcı́a-Cánovas F. Acosta M. Biochem. J. 2001; 354: 107-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). AR=1−12r+2[H2O2][E]0Equation 2 The inactivation of ARP was followed against time at pH 7.5. 1 μm ARP was incubated with 0, 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, and 50 mmH2O2. At appropriate times after addition of the enzyme, aliquots were removed, and the activity with ABTS was determined. The conditions used were such that the [H2O2] added with the enzyme aliquot, which varied with time as inactivation proceeded, did not affect the assayed activity. The AR (%) was calculated for each time point and H2O2 concentration. The data were plotted and fits to a first-order exponential decay to obtain values of kobs (observed rate constants of inactivation) were made using SigmaPlot. The rate constant of inactivation (ki ) and dissociation constant (KI ) were calculated from a hyperbolic secondary plot of kobs against [H2O2] using the Michaelis-Menten equation in the form (17Hiner A.N.P. Rodriguez-Lopez J.N. Arnao M.B. Lloyd Raven E. Garcı́a-Cánovas F. Acosta M. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 321-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) shown in Equation 3. kobs=ki[H2O2]KI+[H2O2]Equation 3 The UV-visible spectral changes that occurred over time to peroxidase (LiP or ARP) upon addition of H2O2 (100 or 500 equivalents, respectively) were observed at pH 3.0 and pH 7.0 using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences Lambda-2S spectrophotometer. The reaction of 0.8 μm LiP with 5 μm H2O2 was measured at pH 4.0 and pH 6.0 in stopped-flow experiments done on an Applied Photophysics (Leatherhead, Surrey, UK) SX18.MV stopped-flow instrument fitted with a PDA.1 photodiode array detector. The temperature was controlled at 25 ± 0.1 °C using a Neslab circulating water bath. The multivariate data sets from the stopped-flow were fitted globally using the program Pro/K (Applied Photophysics). Both LiP and ARP showed clear catalase activity. The H2O2 concentration dependence of the initial rates (V0) of O2 production by the two fungal enzymes, shown in Fig.1, demonstrated that both exhibited saturation kinetics. From the curves, values ofK2 (Km ) andk3 (kcat) (see Scheme FSI) could be obtained using Equation 1. Fig. 1A shows the saturation curve for LiP with K2 = 8.6 ± 0.4 mm and k3 = 2.87 ± 0.21 s−1; in B the corresponding values for ARP wereK2 = 10.2 ± 2.3 mm andk3 = 1.15 ± 0.09 s−1. Thus both LiP and ARP had kinetic parameters for O2 generation of an order of magnitude similar to those determined previously for HRP-C (18Hernández-Ruiz J. Arnao M.B. Hiner A.N.P. Garcı́a-Cánovas F. Acosta M. Biochem. J. 2001; 354: 107-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) and HRP-A2 (35Hiner A.N.P. Hernández-Ruiz J. Rodrı́guez-López J.N. Arnao M.B. Varón R. Garcı́a-Cánovas F. Acosta M. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 2001; 6: 504-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). However, during experiments it was noticed that the values of V0 for LiP were maintained for only a very short time and that O2 production essentially ceased in ∼10 min, whereas for ARP it took about 1 h for activity to be lost. This suggested that LiP was being inactivated more rapidly than ARP. Determinations of the total O2 gas produced by a given amount of enzyme before its inactivation (i.e. the infinite product of the catalase reaction) confirmed that LiP lost activity much more rapidly than ARP. The values of the partition ratios (r), obtained from the slopes of the straight line fits to plots of [O2]∞ against [peroxidase] (not shown) (18Hernández-Ruiz J. Arnao M.B. Hiner A.N.P. Garcı́a-Cánovas F. Acosta M. Biochem. J. 2001; 354: 107-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) indicated that LiP (r = 155 ± 25) was more sensitive to inactivation by H2O2 than ARP (r = 620 ± 60). Additionally, using the relationship r ≈k3/ki (18Hernández-Ruiz J. Arnao M.B. Hiner A.N.P. Garcı́a-Cánovas F. Acosta M. Biochem. J. 2001; 354: 107-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) (see SchemeFSI), it was calculated that the inactivation constant of LiP (ki = (18.5 ± 2.3) × 10−3 s−1) was 10-fold higher than for ARP (ki = (1.85 ± 0.18) × 10−3 s−1). Thus the ki of ARP was approximately equivalent to the value for HRP-C (18Hernández-Ruiz J. Arnao M.B. Hiner A.N.P. Garcı́a-Cánovas F. Acosta M. Biochem. J. 2001; 354: 107-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), but LiP was inactivated much more rapidly (TableI).Table IRate constants for the catalase-like activity and inactivation of LiP and ARP compared with those of HRP-CEnzymeConstants from oxygen measurementsConstants from inactivation studiesK21-aSee Equation 1.k31-aSee Equation 1.r1-bThe partition ratio,r = (k3 +k4)/ki wherek3 ≫ k4, 4 ≈k3/ki.kiki1-cSee Equation 3.KI1-cSee Equation 3.r1-bThe partition ratio,r = (k3 +k4)/ki wherek3 ≫ k4, 4 ≈k3/ki.mms−1×10−3s−1×10−3 s−1mmLiP8.6 ± 0.42.87 ± 0.21155 ± 2518.5 ± 2.320.0 ± 3.06.1 ± 0.4565 ± 15ARP10.2 ± 2.31.15 ± 0.09620 ± 601.85 ± 0.181.37 ± 0.273.83 ± 0.35425 ± 35HRP-C4.0 ± 0.61-dFrom Ref. 18.1.78 ± 0.121-dFrom Ref. 18.700 ± 1001-dFrom Ref. 18.2.5 ± 0.21-dFrom Ref. 18.3.92 ± 0.061-eFrom Ref. 19.1.3 ± 0.21-fFrom Ref. 32.624 ± 401-fFrom Ref. 32.1-a See Equation 1.1-b The partition ratio,r = (k3 +k4)/ki wherek3 ≫ k4, 4 ≈k3/ki.1-c See Equation 3.1-d From Ref. 18Hernández-Ruiz J.

Open table in a new tab Both ARP and LiP were more effective catalases at neutral than at acidic pH (data not shown). The apparent pKa ≈ 6 observed for ARP was quite similar to the value with HRP-C (18Hernández-Ruiz J. Arnao M.B. Hiner A.N.P. Garcı́a-Cánovas F. Acosta M. Biochem. J. 2001; 354: 107-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), suggesting the involvement of the conserved distal histidine residue and that catalase activity is an enzymatic reaction. It has been shown recently that O2⨪ scavengers (superoxide dismutase, TNM, and Mn2+) have only limited effects on HRP-C catalase activity (38Hiner A.N.P. Hernández-Ruiz J. Williams G.A. Arnao M.B. Garcı́a-Cánovas F. Acosta M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 392: 295-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 43Baker C.J. Deahl K. Domek J. Orlandi E.W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 382: 232-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Fig.2 shows the effects of O2⨪scavengers on ARP. Superoxide dismutase and TNM, which generate O2 and H2O2 from O2⨪, slightly increased O2 production. In contrast Mn2+, which regenerates H2O2 but does not yield O2, slightly reduced the level of O2 released. Thus it appears that ARP, like HRP-C, produces O2 in an enzymatic reaction and not, except for a very minor component, as the result of the chemical disproportionation of O2⨪ in solution. Incubation experiments over a range of H2O2 concentrations and pH values were used to probe further the inactivation of LiP and ARP. In Fig.3 it can be seen that LiP (A) was more sensitive to H2O2 than was ARP (Fig.3B), as expected from the O2 measurements above. The insets show that both enzymes were more sensitive at acidic than at neutral pH. The values of r obtained here, calculated using Equation 2, were in reasonable agreement with those from oxygen measurements at the same pH (Table I). This suggests that, as for HRP-C (18Hernández-Ruiz J. Arnao M.B. Hiner A.N.P. Garcı́a-Cánovas F. Acosta M. Biochem. J. 2001; 354: 107-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), the level of turnover through the catalase reaction is correlated strongly with protection of the peroxidase against inactivation by H2O2. The kinetics of inactivation were measured directly by following the time-dependent fall in peroxidase activity, determined using ABTS, as a function of H2O2concentration. In Fig. 4A the inactivation curves for ARP are shown, and in B the H2O2 concentration-dependent saturation curve from which values of ki = (1.37 ± 0.27) × 10−3 s−1 andKI = 3.83 ± 0.35 mm were calculated (see Equation 3). The equivalent experiments performed for LiP (data not shown) yielded values of ki = (20.0 ± 3.0) × 10−3 s−1 andKI = 6.1 ± 0.45 mm. In both cases the values of ki were in good agreement with those calculated independently from the oxygraph data. The value of KI is related to theK2 obtained from oxygen measurements.

More recently CD155 has been revealed as a tumor antigen and a potential target for therapeutic intervention as its expression is up-regulated in neuroectodermal cancers, including glioblastoma multiforme, medulloblastoma, and colorectal carcinoma (20Gromeier M.

Our preliminary studies have revealed that CD155 is expressed during embryonic development with peak levels that occur during midgestation and then decline (25Gromeier M. Solecki D. Patel D.D. Wimmer E. Virology. 2000; 273: 248-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Expression is observed in mesenchymal structures like the notochord and ventrally derived structures of the developing central nervous system (CNS)1 such as the floor plate, motor neurons of the ventral neural tube, and retinal ganglion layer of the retina. The related nectin-1 (PRR1) gene has been mapped as a locus of inherited midline dysraphism syndromes in humans (26Suzuki K., Hu, D. Bustos T. Zlotogora J. Richieri-Costa A. Helms J.A. Spritz R.A. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 427-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Analyses of transcriptional regulation of CD155expression demonstrated activator protein-2 (AP-2) and nuclear respiratory factor-1 (NRF-1) to be potent regulators ofCD155 transcription (23Solecki D.

Chem. 1999; 274: 1791-1800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). During CNS development, these transcription factors are expressed in some of the locations ofCD155 expression, such as neural tube and retina, suggesting a role for these factors in directing developmental CD155expression (27Mitchell P.J. Timmons P.M. Hebert J.M. Rigby P.W. Tjian R. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 105-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar, 28Becker T.S. Burgess S.M. Amsterdam A.H. Allende M.L. Hopkins N.

AP-2 and NRF-1 are not expressed in ventral midline structures during embryogenesis (27Mitchell P.J. Timmons P.M. Hebert J.M. Rigby P.W. Tjian R.

Genome. 2000; 11: 104-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), an observation suggesting that our understanding of the factors contributing toward expression ofCD155 remains incomplete. The secreted morphogen Sonic hedgehog (Shh) plays an essential role in patterning many structures during development, including the notochord and ventral CNS, the developing limb, lung, and foregut (30Hammerschmidt M. Brook A. McMahon A.P. Trends Genet. 1997; 13: 14-21Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar, 31Tanabe Y. Jessell T.M.

The most well characterized location for Shh action is the anterior neural tube, associated with notochord, floor plate, and the motoneuronal system. Secreted Shh from the notochord induces floor plate, which in turn becomes a source of Shh that patterns many ventral neuron types along the entire anterior-posterior axis of the developing CNS (31Tanabe Y. Jessell T.M. Science. 1996; 274: 1115-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). Another location of Shh action is the developing optic system (34Zhang X.M. Yang X.J. Development. 2001; 128: 943-957PubMed Google Scholar, 35Jensen A.M. Wallace V.A. Development. 1997; 124: 363-371PubMed Google Scholar). Shh is expressed in the retinal ganglion layer and regulates patterning and cell number in the developing retina (34Zhang X.M. Yang X.J. Development. 2001; 128: 943-957PubMed Google Scholar, 35Jensen A.M. Wallace V.A. Development. 1997; 124: 363-371PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover Shh is a potent mitogen for neuronal precursors (36Wechsler-Reya R.J. Scott M.P. Neuron. 1999; 22: 103-114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1029) Google Scholar, 37Rowitch D.H. Jacques B.S. Lee S.M. Flax J.D. Snyder E.Y. McMahon A.P. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 8954-8965Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly Shh signaling has been implicated in the oncogenesis of neuroectodermal tumors because mutations in the Shh receptor Patched are observed in medulloblastoma and basal cell carcinomas (38Hahn H.

Oncogene. 1997; 15: 361-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Indeed activation of the Shh signaling cascade, either by mutation or overexpression of activated signaling components, has been shown to cause medulloblastomas and basal cell carcinomas in mice (42Goodrich L.V.

Genet. 2000; 24: 216-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). The mechanism(s) of the morphogenic activity of Shh is currently under investigation (45Kalderon D. Cell. 2000; 103: 371-374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 46Ingham P.W. McMahon A.P. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 3059-3087Crossref PubMed Scopus (2422) Google Scholar). Available evidence suggests transmission of a Shh signal to occur by the diffusible 19-kDa Shh N-terminal fragment that is autoproteolytically cleaved from the full-length Shh protein by the action of the Shh C terminus. The secreted Shh N-terminal fragment binds to the Patched-Smoothened receptor complex that leads to transduction of the Shh signal. Shh receptor activation induces GLI proto-oncogene transcription factors, which then bind to and activate the transcription of Shh-responsive genes (45Kalderon D. Cell. 2000; 103: 371-374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 46Ingham P.W. McMahon A.P. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 3059-3087Crossref PubMed Scopus (2422) Google Scholar). Since Shh is involved in the morphogenesis of embryonic structures identified to harbor CD155 expression, we tested whether theCD155 gene is a target of Shh signaling. Here we report theCD155 gene to be transcriptionally activated when human Ntera-2 cells were treated with recombinant Shh protein. Transient overexpression of Shh activated reporter gene expression driven by theCD155 core promoter. Up-regulation of reporter expression was dependent on an intact GLI binding site within the CD155core promoter. According to their observed function as downstream effectors of the Shh signal, GLI proto-oncogene transcription factors (Gli1 and Gli3) strongly activated theCD155 core promoter. C3H10 T1/2 (mouse embryonic fibroblast, ATCC) and Ntera-2 clone D1 (teratocarcinoma, ATCC) cell lines were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal bovine serum. A rabbit polyclonal antiserum, NAEZ-8, was raised against a recombinant protein encompassing the extracellular domain of human CD155 fused to a hexahistidine tag. The protein was expressed in HEK-293 cells and purified to homogeneity from culture supernatants. 2R. Welker and E. Wimmer, unpublished results. Mouse monoclonal antibody 5E1 against the N-terminal peptide of Shh was obtained from the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank. 1 × 107 Ntera-2 clone D1 cells were seeded into 10-cm dishes. 18 h after passage, the serum-containing medium that was used to seed the cells was exchanged for serum-free medium. After 12 h, purified Shh-Np protein (palmitoylated Shh-N, a kind gift of Phil Beachy, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD) was then added to the medium to a final concentration of 5 nm (∼150 ng/ml) and incubated for 18 h. Total mRNA was then isolated from the treated and untreated cultures. RT-PCR was then used to analyze the levels of CD155, Gli1, and β-actin RNA within these samples. 10 μg of total RNA was used as template for reverse transcription using Superscript II (Invitrogen) primed with random hexamers, and the resulting first strand cDNA was amplified in parallel using the following primers: cd1555′, 5′-cgagccatggccgccgcgtggccg-3′; cd155 3′, 5′-ggtctgagtgccaggtgatttgggct-3′; Gli1 5′, 5′-attggcaccatgagcccatctctggg-3′; Gli1 3′, 5′-ccttcaaacgtgcacttgtgtggc-3′. The cycling parameters for amplification were 95 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min for 30 cycles. The PCR products were then run on a 1% agarose gel and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and southern hybridization with radiolabeled probes was used to detect the CD155-, Gli1-, or β-actin-specific RT-PCR products. Transient transfections were carried out in the C3H10 T1/2 mouse fibroblast cell line using FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Each transfection mixture contained 250 ng of the wild type CD155 core promoter (BE, see Solecki et al.Refs. 22Solecki D. Schwarz S. Wimmer E. Lipp M. Bernhardt G. J. Biol.

Co-transfections were filled in with empty pcDNA3 so that a total of 250 ng of pcDNA3 backbone plasmid would be constant for each transfection. Basal reporter activity was determined by co-transfecting empty pcDNA3 vector alone. 18 h post-transfection cells were harvested, and luciferase activity in the lysates of transfected cells was measured using Luciferase Assay Reagent (Promega). CD155tg21 (47Koike S. Taya C. Aoki J. Matsuda Y. Ise I. Takeda H. Matsuzaki T. Amanuma H. Yonekawa H. Nomoto A. Arch.

Frozen sections were collected on poly-l-lysine-coated slides, air dried, and postfixed in cold 1:1 methanol/acetone for 1 h at −20 °C. For CD155/Shh-N double labeling sections were blocked with M.O.M. blocking reagent (Vector Laboratories) followed by overnight incubation at 4 °C with a 1:500 dilution of CD155 antibody NAEZ-8 and 1:2 dilution of hybridoma supernatant 5E1 in M.O.M. diluent (Vector Laboratories). After 1 h of washing with phosphate-buffered saline the sections were incubated with a 1:200 dilution of Alexa488-conjugated anti-rabbit (Molecular Probes) and a 1:500 dilution of Cy3-conjugated anti-mouse (Jackson Immuno Research) secondary antibodies for 1 h at 37 °C. The sections were washed extensively with phosphate-buffered saline and mounted with Immu-Mount (Shandon, Pittsburgh, PA). CD155 single labeling was essentially done as above except that blocking and antibody dilutions were done in phosphate-buffered saline containing 2% normal goat serum instead of M.O.M. blocking reagent. Images were acquired on a Zeiss Axioplan II fluorescence microscope equipped with a model SP401 camera (Diagnostic Instruments Inc.) and processed with Adobe Photoshop software. We have recently constructed CD155 promoter-LacZ transgenic mice using a 3.0-kb CD155 core promoter (Fig.1 A) to drive the reporter gene (25Gromeier M. Solecki D. Patel D.D. Wimmer E. Virology. 2000; 273: 248-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Histochemical examination of β-galactosidase activity in embryos harboring the CD155 promoter-LacZ transgene has revealed that the CD155 promoter possesses elements that direct reporter gene expression in a profile similar to the endogenous expression of CD155. β-Galactosidase activity was observed in midline structures, i.e. notochord, floor plate, and presumptive motor neurons of the anterior horn along the anterior-posterior axis of the transgenic embryos. In addition, expression was seen in the developing retina, optic chiasm, and optic nerve. To expand our studies of CD155 expression during embryogenesis we have also examined CD155 protein expression in CD155 transgenic mice. These mice possess the entire CD155 gene, are susceptible to poliovirus infection, and suffer a syndrome very similar to human poliomyelitis suggesting that CD155 is expressed in the appropriate locations. Indeed CD155 protein in embryos ofCD155tg mice (ICR-PVRTg21, Ref. 47Koike S. Taya C. Aoki J. Matsuda Y. Ise I. Takeda H. Matsuzaki T. Amanuma H. Yonekawa H. Nomoto A. Arch. Virol. 1994; 139: 351-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) is detectable in a profile similar to that in the CD155 promoter-LacZ transgenic mouse embryos. Expression was observed in the floor plate, notochord, and sclerotome (Fig2 A) as well as the optic nerve and chiasm (not shown). Particularly the expression pattern of CD155 within the floor plate matched that of Shh-N (Fig. 2, A–C). We furthermore detected CD155 protein expression in the mesenchyme surrounding the branching primordial tubules of the lung epithelium (Fig. 3, B and C) as well as the cartilage primordium of the developing ribs (Fig.3 D). Both tissues are known regulatory targets of the hedgehog signaling cascade (32Litingtung Y. Lei L. Westphal H. Chiang C. Nat. Genet. 1998; 20: 58-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar). It is particularly noteworthy that CD155 was mostly concentrated in the mesenchyme surrounding the more distal portions of the tubules precisely where Gli1 is found and where the highest level of Shh in the adjacent lung epithelium has been reported (32Litingtung Y. Lei L. Westphal H. Chiang C. Nat. Genet. 1998; 20: 58-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar, 48Miller L.A. Wert S.E. Whitsett J.A. J. Histochem.

For these experiments, we treated undifferentiated human Ntera-2 clone D1 cells with 5 nm Shh-Np protein. Undifferentiated Ntera-2 cells possess a primitive neuroepithelial cell phenotype and are sensitive to many signaling pathways that modulate the differentiation and proliferation of neuronal precursor cells (49Pleasure S.J. Page C. Lee V.M. J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 1802-1815Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 50Pleasure S.J. Lee V.M. J. Neurosci. Res. 1993; 35: 585-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). Based on expressed sequence tag data base searches and RT-PCR experiments, Ntera-2 cells express the Shh receptors Patched and Smoothened and the GLI zinc finger transcription factors required for transduction of a Shh signal (data not shown). Total RNA was isolated from treated and untreated Ntera-2 cells, reverse-transcribed with random hexamers, and then amplified with primer sets specific for mRNAs of CD155, theGli1 transcription factor (a gene known to be activated strongly by Shh), and β-actin (an internal control for RNA loading). Whereas RT-PCR products corresponding to CD155 andGli1 message could barely be demonstrated in control cultures, abundant β-actin message was readily detected (see Fig.4). In contrast, treatment of Ntera-2 cells with 5 nm Shh-Np produced an increase in both of theCD155- and Gli1-specific transcript RNAs, whereas the β-actin levels remained stable. Gli1 has been demonstrated to be a primary target of the Shh signaling cascade. Our observations of an increase of the CD155 RT-PCR product in the presence of Shh suggested that the CD155 gene, likeGli1, is a transcriptional target of the Shh signaling cascade. The results of our Shh induction assay provided qualitative evidence thatCD155 mRNA is increased by the addition of Shh protein to Ntera-2 cultures, suggesting that CD155 transcription may be activated by Shh. We next sought to determine whether theCD155 promoter could be activated by Shh signaling. Moreover we designed experiments to map the region(s) of the promoter that would convey responsiveness to Shh. Examination of the CD155promoter revealed three regions with matching GLI consensus binding (51Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 634-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar) sites within the 3.0-kb fragment that was used to produce our promoter transgenic mice lines (Fig. 1 A). Interestingly one of these sites was located within the CD155 core promoter, known to harbor many of the elements required for cell type-specific expression of CD155. The CD155 core promoter is 280 bp in length, possesses multiple transcriptional initiation sites, and harbors four known cis-acting elements (termed FPI–IV, see Fig. 1 B) as determined by DNase I footprinting and functional linker scanning mutagenesis (22Solecki D. Schwarz S. Wimmer E. Lipp M. Bernhardt G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5579-5586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 23Solecki D. Bernhardt G. Lipp M. Wimmer E. J. Biol.

A GLI binding motif is located near the 5′ border within FPIII, the largest footprinted region of the CD155 core promoter (see Fig. 1 B). We next tested whether the CD155 core promoter could be activated by Shh signaling using a transient transfection system. C3H10 T1/2 cells were used for these experiments because Ntera-2 cells proved difficult to transfect on a consistent basis. C3H10 T1/2 cells were previously reported to possess the necessary cellular machinery to transduce a Shh signal in transient transfection assays (52Kinto N. Iwamoto M. Enomoto-Iwamoto M. Noji S.

Nature. 2001; 411: 716-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). ACD155 core promoter/fire fly luciferase reporter construct was co-transfected into C3H10 T1/2 cells with a full-length Shh expression vector. Co-transfection of 5 ng of the Shhexpression vector led to a 4-fold higher level of luciferase expression compared with cells co-transfected with the control vector (see Fig.5 A, n = 4). We next tested whether the GLI binding motif located within FPIII was required for activation by using a mutant CD155 core promoter/reporter construct lacking this motif, termed ΔGli (see Fig.1 B for the location of the GLI binding motif and location of the linker scanning mutant). Remarkably no activation of the ΔGli construct was observed when it was transfected with the Shh expression vector (see Fig. 5 A). These results indicated that theCD155 core promoter was responsive to Shh, a result that is consistent with the activation of CD155 core in Ntera-2 cells treated with Shh protein. The GLI binding motif located within FPIII is required for Shh activation of the CD155 core promoter, a result in accordance with known signaling mechanisms induced by Shh. The results of our transient transfection experiments suggested that GLI transcription factors may play an important role in mediating Shh activation of the CD155 core promoter. We therefore tested whether GLI factors could directly activate reporter gene expression by co-transfecting the CD155 core promoter construct with expression vectors encoding the human Gli1 orGli3 cDNAs. Peak levels of activation of luciferase expression were observed when 5 ng of the Gli1 orGli3 expression vectors, respectively, were co-transfected with the CD155 core promoter construct (see Fig.5 B, n = 4). Expression of Gli1led to a 24-fold increase in reporter gene expression, while co-expression of Gli3 produced 18-fold activation over basal levels (Fig. 5 B). As expected, co-transfection of theGli1 or Gli3 expression vectors with the ΔGli mutant CD155 core promoter construct failed to elicit a similar response (Fig. 5 B). Taken together our results suggest that Gli1 and Gli3 are potent activators of the CD155 core promoter and that activation is mediated by a consensus GLI binding motif located in FPIII. Temporospatial expression patterns for many cell adhesion molecules of the immunoglobulin superfamily are consistent with functions during embryonic development. We have described activity of the CD155 promoter and expression of CD155 protein in anterior midline structures of the developing human CNS (25Gromeier M. Solecki D. Patel D.D. Wimmer E. Virology. 2000; 273: 248-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Similarly, in CD155tg mouse embryos, CD155 can be detected in the notochord, ventral neural tube, optic nerve/chiasm, and cartilage primordia such as the rib and sclerotome as well as the mesenchyme surrounding the branching primordial tubules of the developing lung (see Figs. 2 and 3). Shh, an important morphogen, is expressed in many of the same locations as CD155 during development (Refs. 30Hammerschmidt M. Brook A. McMahon A.P.

We tested the possibility that the CD155 gene may be a transcriptional target of the Shh signaling cascade. The CD155 core promoter harbors a potential GLI binding site, a finding that is consistent with the fact that many of the promoters of transcriptional targets of Shh target genes frequently harbor binding sites for the GLI family of transcription factors. Treatment of the human Ntera-2 cell line with purified Shh-Np protein led to an increase of both CD155 andGli1 mRNAs (Fig. 4). Although the results of this assay are qualitative in nature since they are based upon RT-PCR, they suggest that like Gli1, the CD155 gene is a transcriptional target of Shh signaling. Importantly this hypothesis is supported by data indicating that the CD155 core promoter is activated by co-transfection of a Shh expression vector and that this activity required an intact GLI binding motif (Fig. 5). Not surprisingly GLI proto-oncogene transcription factors themselves (Gli1 and Gli3) directly activated theCD155 core promoter (Fig. 5). The observed role of Shh and GLI transcription factors in the regulation of expression of CD155 is consistent with their association with structures associated with the developing embryo (31Tanabe Y. Jessell T.M. Science. 1996; 274: 1115-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). Our previous studies have dissected the cis-acting elements required for basal activity of the CD155 core promoter and identified their interactions with AP-2 and NRF-1 transcription factors (22Solecki D. Schwarz S. Wimmer E. Lipp M. Bernhardt G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5579-5586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 23Solecki D. Bernhardt G. Lipp M. Wimmer E. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 1791-1800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The GLI binding motif located within the boundaries of FPIII differs from the NRF-1 and AP-2 consensus binding sites in that mutation of this motif had little effect on basal promoter activity (24Solecki D.J. Wimmer E. Lipp M. Bernhardt G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1791-1800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). This suggests that this cis-element may act as a Shh-dependent enhancer within the CD155 core promoter. Shh-dependent activation of the CD155promoter may contribute to the observed expression profile of CD155 within embryonic structures patterned by Shh. Shh activation of CD155 expression may be highly relevant for the overexpression of CD155 in cancers like medulloblastoma or glioblastoma. A peak of CD155 expression was observed during midgestation of human and transgenic mouse embryos (Ref. 25Gromeier M. Solecki D. Patel D.D. Wimmer E. Virology. 2000; 273: 248-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, and see Figs. 2 and 3). Interestingly up-regulation of CD155 expression is observed in neuroectodermal malignancy (e.g. medulloblastoma or glioblastoma), an observation suggesting that gene regulatory pathways exist in these tumors that reactivate CD155 expression (20Gromeier M. Lachmann S. Rosenfeld M.R. Gutin P.H. Wimmer E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6803-6808Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Recently both Shh and the GLI transcription factors have been implicated in the oncogenesis of neuroectodermal and cutaneous cancers (for review, see Ref. 56Toftgard R. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2000; 57: 1720-1731Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Loss-of-function mutations of the Shh receptor Patched are found in spontaneous and familial forms of medulloblastoma (40Raffel C. Jenkins R.B. Frederick L. Hebrink D. Alderete B. Fults D.W. James C.D. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 842-845PubMed Google Scholar, 41Vorechovsky I. Tingby O. Hartman M. Stromberg B. Nister M. Collins V.P. Toftgard R. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 361-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Indeed loss of one Patched allele reportedly led to medulloblastoma-like lesions in the cerebellum of mice (42Goodrich L.V. Milenkovic L. Higgins K.M. Scott M.P. Science. 1997; 277: 1109-1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (1403) Google Scholar). Human Gli1 was first identified because of its association with glioblastoma (57Kinzler K.W. Bigner S.H. Bigner D.D. Trent J.M. Law M.L. O'Brien S.J. Wong A.J. Vogelstein B. Science. 1987; 236: 70-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar), and the Gli1 gene has subsequently been localized near a hotspot of gene duplication in these tumors (58Reifenberger G. Reifenberger J. Ichimura K. Collins V.P. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 731-734PubMed Google Scholar). Up-regulation of Gli1 expression is commonly observed in human medulloblastomas (56Toftgard R. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2000; 57: 1720-1731Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 59Reifenberger J. Wolter M. Weber R.G. Megahed M. Ruzicka T. Lichter P. Reifenberger G. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 1798-1803PubMed Google Scholar) and the medulloblastoma-like lesions of germ line manipulated mice lacking one Patched allele (42Goodrich L.V. Milenkovic L. Higgins K.M. Scott M.P. Science. 1997; 277: 1109-1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (1403) Google Scholar). Up-regulation of GLI genes may be an important determinant in carcinogenesis as constitutive overexpression of Gli1 orGli2 in skin leads to spontaneous basal cell carcinomas (43Nilsson M. Unden A.B. Krause D. Malmqwist U. Raza K. Zaphiropoulous P.G. Toftgard R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3438-3443Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar, 44Grachtchouk M., Mo, R., Yu, S. Zhang X. Sasaki H. Hui C.C. Dlugosz A.A. Nat. Genet. 2000; 24: 216-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). In this study, we show that CD155 expression is activated by Shh signaling and that the CD155 core promoter is strongly activated by Gli1 and Gli3. Based on the data presented here, Shh and GLI signaling may be the critical gene regulatory pathway activating CD155 expression in medulloblastoma and glioblastoma. This hypothesis is currently being tested in our laboratory. CD155 has been reported to mediate cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix by a specific interaction with vitronectin (9Lange R. Peng X. Wimmer E. Lipp M. Bernhardt G. Virology. 2001; 285: 218-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The pattern of vitronectin expression during embryonic development overlaps that of CD155, including the notochord, floor plate, and ventral neural tube (60Seiffert D. Iruela-Arispe M.L. Sage E.H. Loskutoff D.J. Dev. Dyn. 1995; 203: 71-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 61Martı́nez-Moralez J.R. Barbas J.A. Martı́ E. Bovolenta P. Edgar D. Rodrı́guez-Tébar A. Development. 1997; 124: 5139-5147PubMed Google Scholar). It is interesting to note that the vitronectin gene also is a Shh target and that its product binds directly to Shh thereby modifying cellular responses to Shh (62Pons S. Marti E. Development. 2000; 127: 333-342Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The physiological role of the CD155/vitronectin/extracellular matrix interaction is unclear in this context. Given the role of vitronectin in modulating Shh responses and the fact that CD155 and vitronectin are both expressed in locations of Shh action, it is tempting to speculate that CD155 may not simply represent a Shh target gene. It may be a constituent of the cellular machinery that modulates Shh action. Interestingly nectin-1, one of the nectin molecules related to CD155, is specifically expressed in the floor plate. 3S. Mueller, J. Zhan, and E. Wimmer, unpublished observations.Examination of the upstream sequence of the nectin-1 gene deposited in the Human Genome Database has revealed the presence of multiple GLI binding motifs suggesting that other nectin-related molecule besides CD155 may be expressed in the floor plate and may be regulated by Shh signaling.

Beachy (Johns Hopkins University) for critical discussion and providing purified Shh-Np protein, Dr. Ken Kinzler (Johns Hopkins University) for providing theGli1 and Gli3 cDNAs, and Dr. Andrew McMahon for providing the full-length Shh cDNA.

One isolate was taxonomically affiliated asPseudomonas anguilliseptica strain BI, and the extracellular cyanophycinase (CphE) was studied because utilization of cyanophycin as a carbon source and extracellular cyanophycinases were hitherto not described. CphE was detected in supernatants of CGP cultures and purified from a corresponding culture of strain BI employing chromatography on the anion exchange matrix Q-Sepharose and on an arginine-agarose affinity matrix. The mature form of the inducible enzyme consisted of one type of subunit withM r = 43,000 and exhibited high specificity for CGP, whereas proteins and synthetic polyaspartic acid were not hydrolyzed or were only marginally hydrolyzed. Degradation products of the enzyme reaction were identified as aspartic acid-arginine dipeptides (β-Asp-Arg) by high performance liquid chromatography and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. The corresponding gene (cphE, 1254 base pairs) was identified in subclones of a cosmid gene library of strain BI by heterologous active expression inEscherichia coli, and its nucleotide sequence was determined. The enzyme exhibited only 27–28% amino acid sequence identity to intracellular cyanophycinases occurring in cyanobacteria. Analysis of the amino acid sequence of cphE revealed a putative catalytic triad consisting of the motif GXSXG plus a histidine and most probably a glutamate residue. In addition, the strong inhibition of the enzyme by Pefabloc® and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride indicated that the catalytic mechanism of CphE is related to that of serine type proteases.

Microbiology. 1996; 142: 611-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The water-insoluble CGP is accumulated intracellularly in the form of membraneless granules (3Allen M.M. Weathers P. J. Bacteriol. 1980; 141: 959-962Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and is degraded by the cells when growth is resumed. The backbone of this unique biopolymer consists of α-amino-α-carboxyl-linked l-aspartic acid monomers. Most of the β-carboxylic groups are covalently bound to the α-amino groups of l-arginine residues (4Simon R.D. Weathers P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1976; 420: 165-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 5Simon R.D. Lawry N.H. McLendon G.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 626: 277-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar); in recombinantEscherichia coli expressing cyanobacterial CGP-synthesizing enzymes (see below), a significant fraction of arginine is replaced by lysine (6Ziegler K. Diener A. Herpin C. Richter R. Deutzmann R. Lockau W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 254: 154-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Although much information has been obtained concerning the non-ribosomal biosynthesis of CGP, which is catalyzed by the cyanophycin synthetase (CphA; see Ref. 7Oppermann-Sanio F.B. Steinbüchel A. Naturwissenschaften. 2002; 89 (,): 11-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar and cited references therein), only a few reports are available on the intracellular degradation of CGP. Intracellular CGP degradation was first observed in crude extracts of soluble proteins prepared from cells of Anabaena cylindrica (5Simon R.D. Lawry N.H. McLendon G.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 626: 277-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The corresponding enzyme, cyanophycinase (CphB), was purified from a recombinant E. coli harboring thecphB gene from Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 and characterized in detail (8Richter R. Hejazi M. Kraft R. Ziegler K. Lockau W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 263: 163-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Dipeptides consisting of arginine plus aspartic acid and free arginine were identified as products of CGP degradation in addition to small amounts of aspartic acid (8Richter R. Hejazi M. Kraft R. Ziegler K. Lockau W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 263: 163-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In contrast to intracellular degradation, nothing is known about the extracellular decomposition of this biopolymer by bacteria or other microorganisms. In this study, we demonstrate for the first time that CGP can be easily degraded and utilized as the sole carbon source for growth by a variety of non-cyanobacterial eubacteria isolated from different habitats. Because it is known that CGP is resistant to a wide range of commercially available proteases (4Simon R.D. Weathers P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1976; 420: 165-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 9Simon R.D. Fay P. van Baalen C. The Cyanobacteria. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam1987: 199-225Google Scholar), these bacteria must possess an enzyme specialized for CGP degradation. We report on the isolation of a strain of the species Pseudomonas anguillisepticaand describe the substrate utilization capabilities of this bacterium and the purification of an extracellular cyanophycinase (extracellular CGPase (CphE)) from culture supernatants of cells grown on CGP. Furthermore, CphE was biochemically characterized to reveal the degradation mechanism and to identify the cleavage products. In addition, the CGPase gene (cphE) of the isolated P. anguilliseptica strain BI was cloned and characterized. CGP-degrading bacteria isolated in this study are listed in Table I. These strains were either grown on Standard I complex medium (Merck) or grown on basic inorganic medium B (10Claus D. Walker N. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1964; 36: 107-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) for CGP degradation and substrate utilization experiments. The concentrations of CGP and other carbon sources added to the medium are indicated in the text. All isolates were grown at 30 °C. The following microorganisms were used as reference strains in substrate utilization assays on solid CGP medium (see below) with 0.05% (w/v) glucose as an additional carbon source:E. coli K12 (wild type), Pseudomonas putidaKT2440 (11Worsey M.J. Williams P.A. J. Bacteriol. 1975; 124: 7-13Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), Micrococcus luteus (DSMZ 348), Bacillus subtilis 168+ (DSMZ 402), and Bacillus megaterium (DSMZ 319). For CGP production, an E. coliDH1 strain harboring plasmid pMa/c5–914::cphAexpressing cphA from Synechocystis PCC6803 (12Frey, K. M., Oppermann-Sanio, F. B., Schmidt, H., and Steinbüchel, A.

For the preparation of the overlay agar, diethyl ether-sterilized CGP was first dissolved in 0.1 nHCl and then added to sterile medium under vigorous stirring to avoid the formation of inhomogeneous CGP precipitates. For adjustment of the pH value, an equal volume of 0.1 n NaOH was added before pouring plates. For isolation of plasmid DNA, the lithium preparation method was applied (15He M. Wilde A. Kaderbhai M.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 1660Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Total genomic DNA of P. anguilliseptica strain BI was isolated according to the method of Rao et al. (16Rao R.N. Richardson M.A. Kuhstoss S. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 153: 166-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). After partial digestion with the endonuclease PstI, genomic DNA fragments were ligated to the cosmid vector pHC79 (17Hohn B. Collins J. Gene (Amst.). 1980; 11: 291-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar), and E. colistrain S17–1 (18Simon R. Priefer U. Pühler A. Bio/Technology. 1983; 1: 784-790Crossref Scopus (5643) Google Scholar) was used as a recipient for transduction of the cosmid library. A Gigapack® III XL packaging extract (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was employed for the packaging of DNA and subsequent infection of strain S17–1 as described by the manufacturer.E. coli strain XL1-Blue (Stratagene) was used in combination with pBluescript SK− (Stratagene) for cloning of a PstI restriction subfragment (2600 bp), sequence analysis of cphE, and heterologous production of the enzyme. 5′-infrared fluorescence dye 800-labeled synthetic oligonucleotides (MWG-Biotech, Ebersberg, Germany) were used as primers, and a Sequi Therm EXCEL TM II long-read cycle sequencing kit (Epicentre Technologies, Madison, WI) was employed for DNA-sequencing according to the “primer-hopping strategy” (19Strauss E.C. Kobori J.A. Siu G. Hood L.E. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 154: 353-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar).

Nucleic acid sequence data and deduced amino acid sequences were analyzed with the sequence analysis software CAP (Contig Assembly Program; (20Huang X. Genomics. 1992; 14: 18-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar)), ClustAlX 1.8 (21Thompson J.D. Gibson T.J. Plewniak F. Jeanmougin F. Higgins D.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4876-4882Crossref PubMed Scopus (35497) Google Scholar), and Genamics Expression 1.1. The 16-S rRNA gene was amplified from total DNA (see above) using oligonucleotide primers as described before (22Rainey F.A. Ward-Rainey N. Kroppenstedt R.M. Stackebrandt E. Int. J. Syst. Bacteriol. 1996; 46: 1088-1092Crossref PubMed Scopus (947) Google Scholar). After purification of the PCR products with a NucleoTrap®CR kit (Macherey-Nagel, Düren, Germany), their nucleotide sequences were determined as described above. The 16-S rDNA sequence was aligned with published sequences from representative Pseudomonas species from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) data base. The nucleotide and amino acid sequence data reported here for cphE have been submitted to the NCBI data base under accession number AY065671. The 16-S rRNA gene sequence data of P. anguilliseptica strain BI were deposited in the NCBI data base under accession numberAF439803. For production of native CGP,Synechocystis sp. strain PCC6308 was cultivated in full-strength BG11 medium (23Rippka R. Deruelles J. Waterbury J.B. Herdman M. Stanier R.Y. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1979; 111: 1-61Crossref Google Scholar) in an 80-liter closed tubular glass photobioreactor as described before (24Hai T. Ahlers H. Gorenflo V. Steinbüchel A. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2000; 53: 383-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Also, a recombinantE. coli DH1 harboring plasmid pMa/c5–914::cphA (see above) with a temperature-sensitive inducible promoter was employed for the production of CGP. A 42-liter Biostat UD30 stainless steel bioreactor (B. Braun Biotech International, Melsungen, Germany) with TB complex medium was used for production as described previously (12Frey, K. M., Oppermann-Sanio, F. B., Schmidt, H., and Steinbüchel, A. (2002) Appl. Environ. Microbiol.DOI:10.1128/AEM.68.7.000-000.2002Google Scholar). After cell harvest, CGP was isolated according to the method of Simon (25Simon R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1971; 68: 265-267Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which was modified by applying only one washing step at each Triton X-100®concentration and two additional centrifugation steps of the acidic and neutralized suspensions, respectively. The purity of CGP was controlled both by SDS-PAGE with subsequent Coomassie staining (26Weber K. Osborn M. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 4406-4417Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and by HPLC analysis after acid hydrolysis of the polymer and subsequent derivatization of amino groups with o-phtaldialdehyde reagent (27Aboulmagd E. Oppermann-Sanio F.B. Steinbüchel A. Arch. Microbiol. 2000; 174: 297-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Motility and Gram behavior were determined as described before. Oxidase (Bactident® Oxidase test strips from Merck) and catalase tests were performed according to standard protocols. Further determinations were done by using the API 20NE test kit (BioMérieux, Marcy-l'Etoile, France). Reversed phase HPLC was used to determine the products of enzymatic CGP degradation as described by the method for the quantitative determination of amino acids (27Aboulmagd E. Oppermann-Sanio F.B. Steinbüchel A. Arch. Microbiol. 2000; 174: 297-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI) was applied for identification of the final degradation product of CGP by mass determination and structural analysis (28-Google Scholar). All measurements were performed employing a Quattro LCZ system (Micromass, Manchester, UK) with a nanospray inlet. A cell-free supernatant from a CGP culture was obtained by sedimentation of the cells in the late exponential growth phase by centrifugation and subsequent filtration of the supernatant through a 0.2-μm nitrocellulose membrane. All steps were carried out at 4 °C and in the presence of 50 mmsodium phosphate buffer (pH 8.3). Further components added to the buffer are mentioned below. After concentration in an ultrafiltration chamber (Amicon, Beverly, MA) using a YM10 membrane, the buffered solution was applied onto a MonoQ HR5/5 anion exchange column (AmershamBiosciences). After washing the column with 2 bed volumes of buffer, CGPase was eluted with a linear NaCl gradient (0–1 m) employing an increase of NaCl concentration of 17 mm/ml and a total flow rate of 1 ml/min. Active fractions (1 ml) were detected after the transfer of 10 μl of the respective eluates onto CGP overlay plates (see above) by the occurrence of halos after 5–40 min of incubation at 30 °C. Fractions with high activity were combined, desalted by ultrafiltration (see above), and applied onto an arginine-agarose column (5-ml bed volume; Sigma). For selective elution of the enzyme, an arginine gradient (0–1 m) was applied. To avoid nonspecific protein binding and to prevent the enzyme from binding in the presence of high arginine concentrations, the buffer in addition contained 100 mm NaCl. SDS-PAGE of active enzyme fractions or CGP samples was performed in 11.5% polyacrylamide gels according to standard protocols (29Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207233) Google Scholar). Proteins were visualized by the Coomassie staining method (26Weber K. Osborn M. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 4406-4417Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). An “in-gel” renaturation method described for activity staining with proteases after SDS-PAGE (30Salamone P.R. Wodzinski R.J. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 1997; 48: 317-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) was used to obtain reactivated CGPase after separation of enzyme subunits according to their apparent molecular mass under denaturating conditions. The ability of reactivated CGPase to form degradation halos was tested by the application of a thin CGP-agar layer (see above) on top of buffer-pretreated gels. Protein concentrations were determined by the procedure of Bradford (31Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar). For determination of the substrate specificity of the CGPase, the purified recombinant enzyme was incubated at 30 °C in 1 ml of 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 8.3) with various polypeptide substrates. Each reaction contained 1 mg of the respective substrate and 1.6 μg of enzyme. The reaction was stopped after 120 min by incubation at 70 °C for 5 min. After centrifugation, 100-μl aliquots of supernatant were incubated at 95 °C for 5 min in the presence of 1.25% ninhydrin (Merck) in 1 ml of total reaction volume. Subsequently, they were assayed photometrically at 570 nm for the presence of released hydrolysis products. Bovine casein (Hammersten grade) was from Merck, bovine serum albumin (BSA) was from Roth (Karlsruhe, Germany), and poly(α,β-d/l-aspartic acid) (M r = 11,000) was obtained from Bayer (Leverkusen, Germany). Labeling experiments were performed by enzymatic elongation of the C terminus of a CGP primer (32Berg H. Ziegler K. Piotukh K. Baier K. Lockau W. Volkmer-Engert R. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 5561-5570Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar).l-[U-14C]arginine was incorporated into the polymer chain using purified cyanophycin synthetase fromSynechocystis sp. strain PCC6308 heterologously produced inE. coli (27Aboulmagd E. Oppermann-Sanio F.B. Steinbüchel A. Arch. Microbiol. 2000; 174: 297-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Labeled CGP was incubated at 30 °C with 1.6 μg of CGPase in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 8.3) under vigorous shaking. For heat inactivation of the enzyme, 50-μl samples were transferred to test tubes containing 500 μl of water preincubated at 70 °C. After 5 min of inactivation, the samples were transferred onto ice for 5 min to allow for CGP reprecipitation. After subsequent centrifugation, 50 μl of supernatant were mixed with 500 μl of Hydroluma® Scintillation mixture (J. T. Baker, Inc.). Radioactivity was measured with a model LS 6500 scintillation counter (Beckman Instruments (27Aboulmagd E. Oppermann-Sanio F.B. Steinbüchel A. Arch. Microbiol. 2000; 174: 297-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar)). To screen for CGP-degrading bacteria, samples from typical habitats of CGP-producing cyanobacteria were plated onto solid mineral medium containing CGP as the sole carbon source. Due to the insolubility of CGP at neutral pH, the agar was turbid. Colonies of CGP-degrading microorganisms were recognized because of the formation of degradation halos, which appeared after 12–18 h of incubation at 30 °C (Fig.1 A). Based on this feature, axenic cultures of nine bacterial strains were finally isolated from Baltic sea water, different pond sediments, and sewage sludge (Table I). In addition to the newly isolated CGP-degrading strains, other bacteria from our culture collection were also tested, and two additional strains with CGP degradation capability were detected (strains BE2 and PAS1, TableI). However, E. coli K12, P. putida KT2440, M. luteus, B. subtilis 168+, andB. megaterium were not able to cause formation of halos on CGP overlay agar plates, although some of these bacteria (e.g. B. subtilis) are known to use proteins as nutrients. All isolates tested (from Baltic sea water, pond sediment, and sewage sludge,i.e. “A, B, and D series”; Table I) were Gram-negative, oxidase- and catalase-positive rod-shaped bacteria. With the exception of isolate DXIII, all strains showed motility. Applying the API 20NE test kit, two isolates (DIII and DIV) revealed acceptable identification profiles. Both strains were taxonomically affiliated as strains of the species Pseudomonas alcaligenes (TableII). As listed in Table I, most strains isolated in this study showed growth on the amino acid constituents of CGP, i.e. on aspartic acid and arginine. For most strains, growth with arginine was faster than with aspartic acid. Only isolate BI showed no growth on aspartic acid. Strain PAS 1 from the culture collection of our institute also did not grow on aspartic acid as the sole carbon source. None of the isolates was able to grow on synthetic poly(α,β-d/l-aspartic acid) (data not shown). With poly(γ-d-glutamic acid) as the sole carbon source, only isolate DXIII and to some extent also P. alcaligenes strain BE2 (33Oppermann F.B Pickartz S. Steinbüchel A. Polym. Degrad. Stabil. 1998; 59: 337-344Crossref Google Scholar) showed growth (Table I). With bovine serum albumin as the sole carbon source, only strain PAS I and P. alcaligenes strain BE2 exhibited good or poor growth, respectively. Citrulline and ornithine, two putative degradation products of arginine, were not utilized as carbon sources for growth by any of the bacteria investigated in this study. The only exceptions were isolate AVN, which was able to grow on ornithine, and B. subtilis 168+, which utilized citrulline (data not shown).Table IISubstrate utilization of CGP-degrading bacteria in the API 20NE physiological determination assayIsolateStrainAPI 20 NE-Assays2-aND, taxonomically not determinable with this test; –, no growth; +, poor growth.2-bAPI20 NE tests: NO2, NO3 reduction → NO2; ADH, arginine dihydrolase; GEL, gelatinase; OX, oxidase assay; aerobic substrate utilization: MLT, malate; CIT, citrate; CAP, caprate.NO2ADHGELOXMLTCITCAPAVNND–––++++BI P. anguilliseptica2-cTaxonomically determined by 16-S rDNA sequence analysis.–+–++++DIII P. alcaligenes+–+++++DIV P. alcaligenes+–+++++Strain AVN was isolated from Baltic sea water, strain BI was obtained from pond sediments, and the strains of the D-series were isolated from sewage sludge.

The following tests were negative for all four isolates and are not shown in the table: denitrification test; indole formation (tryptophan conversion); urease test; β-glucosidase test; β-galactosidase test; anaerobic utilization of glucose (fermentation); aerobic substrate utilization tests: glucose, arabinose, mannose, manitol, N-acetyl-glucosamine, maltose, gluconate, adipate, phenyl-acetate. For several reasons, isolate BI was a good candidate for a more detailed investigation of CGP degradation. Therefore, the taxonomic position of the isolate was determined. Analysis of the 16-S rDNA sequence of isolate BI revealed 98% identity to the nucleotide sequence of all three P. anguillisepticastrains available at the NCBI data base including the P. anguilliseptica type strain NCIMB 1949. Maximum sequence identity to other species of the genus Pseudomonas was only in the range of 95–96% (Fig. 2). Therefore, the new isolate was referred to as P. anguilliseptica strain BI. Preliminary 16-S rDNA sequence data of strain PAS 1 (about 1000 bp) revealed that this strain most probably belongs to the genusStreptomyces. This finding corresponds well with the streptomycete-like habitus of this strain, e.g. the formation of exospores in aging colonies. The ability of P. anguilliseptica strain BI to grow on CGP as the sole carbon source was investigated in more detail. Therefore, growth of this strain on CGP and on its amino acid constituents as well as on the non-related substrate citrate was monitored over 24 h (Fig.3). Living cell counts for the cyanophycin culture revealed that growth of the cells started at about 4 h of incubation (data not shown) after inoculation from a citrate culture. The turbidity caused by suspended CGP particles disappeared visibly during incubation. Strain BI grew best with a combination of arginine and aspartic acid if these amino acids were provided at a molar ratio according to their proportional masses in the CGP molecule (248 Klett units). Growth on CGP led to a maximum optical density of 202 Klett units, which is in the range of the OD of the citrate culture. Slightly weaker growth was detected for the arginine culture (182 Klett units). No increase or change of the OD occurred in the control (sterile medium containing citrate) or in mineral salt medium containing aspartic acid as the sole carbon source (Fig. 3). During growth on CGP, 46% (w/w) of the polymer was converted into cellular dry matter by P. anguilliseptica strain BI. The extracellular CGPase of P. anguilliseptica was purified to electrophoretic homogeneity from CGP-grown cultures by the application of anion exchange chromatography on Q-Sepharose followed by l-arginine-agarose affinity chromatography (Fig. 1 C). The latter is usually used for different purposes, e.g. purification of transfer RNA molecules (34Jay F.T. Coultas C. Jones D.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1976; 3: 177-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The l-arginine-agarose matrix was highly specific for the binding of CGPase under the employed conditions, revealing a high affinity of the enzyme to this matrix. Therefore, an arginine gradient (0–1 m) in sodium phosphate buffer was applied for the elution of the CGPase. To further reduce nonspecific binding of other pro"
https://openalex.org/W2080073755,"The transcription start site of the collagen α2(1) gene (COL1A2) has a sequence-specific binding site for a DNA methylation-responsive binding protein called regulatory factor for X-box 1 (RFX1) (Sengupta, P. K., Erhlich, M., and Smith, B. D. (1999) J. Biol. Chem. 274, 36649–36655). In this report, we demonstrate that RFX1 forms homodimers as well as heterodimers with RFX2 spanning the collagen transcription start site. Methylation at +7 on the coding strand increases RFX1 complex formation in gel shift assays. Methylation on the template strand, however, does not increase RFX1 complex formation. DNA from human fibroblasts contains minimal methylation on the coding strand (<4%) with variable methylation on the template strand. RFX1 acts as a repressor of collagen transcription as judged by in vitro transcription and co-transfection assays with an unmethylated collagen promoter-reporter construct. In addition, an RFX5 complex present in human fibroblasts interacts with the collagen RFX site, which is not sensitive to methylation. This is the first demonstration of RFX5 complex formation on a gene other than major histocompatibility complex (MHC) promoters. Also, RFX5 represses transcription of a collagen promoter-reporter construct in rat fibroblasts that have no detectable RFX5 complex formation or protein. RFX5 complex activates MHC II transcription by interacting with an interferon-γ (IFN-γ)-inducible protein, major histocompatibility class II trans-activator (CIITA). Collagen transcription is repressed by IFN-γ in a dose-dependent manner in human but not in rat fibroblasts. IFN-γ enhances RFX5 binding activity, and CIITA is present in the RFX5 complex of IFN-γ-treated human fibroblasts. CIITA repressed collagen gene transcription more effectively in human fibroblasts than in rat fibroblasts, suggesting that the RFX5 complex may, in part, recruit CIITA protein to the collagen transcription start site. Thus the RFX family may be important repressors of collagen gene transcription through a RFX binding site spanning the transcription start site.

Remodeling of the extracellular matrix is a complex and tightly regulated process occurring during embryogenesis, angiogenesis, and wound repair. In the majority of normal adult tissue, there is limited turnover of extracellular matrix until injury occurs. In contrast, the balance between synthesis and degradation of extracellular matrix in many pathological conditions is disrupted leading to abnormal matrix remodeling. This disruption can lead to excessive accumulation of matrix proteins in fibrotic diseases such as scleroderma (1Trojanowska M. LeRoy E.C. Eckes B. Krieg T. J. Mol. Med. 1998; 76: 266-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), liver cirrhosis (2Neubauer K. Saile B. Ramadori G. Can. J. Gastroenterol. 2001; 15: 187-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), and lung fibrosis (3Goldstein R.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: L29-L40PubMed Google Scholar). Alternatively, excessive breakdown exists in conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis (4Vincenti M.P. Clark I.M. Brinckerhoff C.E. Arthritis Rheum. 1994; 37: 1115-1126Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), osteoarthritis (5Malemud C.J. Goldberg V.M. Front. Biosci. 1999; 4: D762-D771Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), periodontitis (6Birkedal-Hansen H. J. Periodontol. 1993; 64: 474-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar), tumor invasion, and metastasis (7Forget M.A. Desrosiers R.R. Beliveau R. Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 1999; 77: 465-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Cytokines have been implicated in the development of pathological conditions (6Birkedal-Hansen H. J. Periodontol. 1993; 64: 474-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). Among these factors interleukin 1 (IL-1),1 tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interferon-γ (IFN-γ), and transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) (8Massague J. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1990; 6: 597-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (3008) Google Scholar) have been detected and are considered essential in inflammatory sites, healing wounds, and during tissue remodeling. These growth factors can positively (TGF-β) or negatively (IL-1, TNF-α, and IFN-γ) regulate the expression of extracellular matrix genes, in particular collagen genes. For example, TNF-α and IFN-γ work synergistically to oppose activation of collagen transcription by TGF-β (9Kahari V.M. Chen Y.Q., Su, M.W. Ramirez F. Uitto J. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 86: 1489-1495Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Type I collagen is a predominant protein in fibrotic lesions and consists of two α1(1) (COL1A1) chains and one α2(1) chain (COL1A2). Studies in diverse systems have identified various transcription factors that regulate collagen transcription. These include ubiquitously expressed transcription factors such as Sp1 and Sp3 and nuclear factor for Y box or CAAT binding factor (NF-Y/CBF) that are essential for constitutive expression (10Ihn H.

It is known that on other genes NF-Y/CBP interacts with GCN5 and PCAF (14Currie R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1430-1434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) and Sp1 interacts with c-AMP response element protein (CREB) binding protein (CBP) or p300 (CBP/p300) on other promoters (15Liu Z. Simpson E.R. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1999; 153: 183-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In addition, transfection studies have located responsive elements in the collagen promoters that can be modulated by growth factors (16Ritzenthaler J.D. Goldstein R.H. Fine A. Lichtler A. Rowe D.W.

In addition, IFN-γ antagonizes TGF-β possibly through competition for p300/CBP and indirectly through interferon regulatory factor-1 and signal transducers and activators of transcription 1α (12Ghosh A.K.

Our previous studies indicate that the collagen α2(1) transcription start site contains a sequence-specific, methylation-responsive binding site for regulatory factor for X-box 1 (RFX1, also referred to as methylated DNA binding protein) (28Sengupta P.K. Erhlich M. Smith B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36649-36655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). This protein belongs to a family with conserved DNA binding domains (29Emery P. Durand B. Mach B. Reith W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 803-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Three of the family members (RFX1, RFX2, and RFX3) form heterodimers as well as homodimers and contain both activation and repression domains (30Reith W. Herrero-Sanchez C. Kobr M. Silacci P.

RFX4 was identified as part of a variant estrogen receptor expressed in breast cancer (29Emery P. Durand B. Mach B. Reith W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 803-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) and has now been characterized as a testes-specific family member that can dimerize with RFX2 and RFX3 (33Morotomi-Yano K. Yano Ki K. Saito H. Sun Z. Iwama A. Miki Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 277: 836-842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The fifth member of the family, RFX5, has been well characterized as a major protein involved in IFN-γ-activated and constitutive transcription of major histocompatibility complex type II (MHC II) proteins (34Reith W. Mach B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2001; 19: 331-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar, 35Mach B. Science. 1999; 285: 1367Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). This protein forms a trimeric complex with two proteins, RFXB/RFXANK and RFXAP (36Moreno C.S. Rogers E.M. Brown J.A. Boss J.M. J.

However, an additional protein, class II transactivator, CIITA, is necessary for transactivation of MHC II transcription. Mutations in the proteins CIITA, RFX5, RFXB/RFXANK, or RFXAP cause bare lymphocyte disorder, a severe immune deficiency that eliminates MHC II from cell surfaces. RFX5 complex formation on MHC II promoter is required to recruit CIITA. The CIITA protein interacts cooperatively with several other proteins on the promoter such as NF-Y/CBF (38Zhu X.S.

For example, CIITA suppresses transcription of several thyroid-specific genes while at the same time it activates MHC II (45Mori-Aoki A. Pietrarelli M. Nakazato M. Caturegli P. Kohn L.D. Suzuki K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 278: 58-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Synthesis of two other Th2 cell proteins, FAS ligand and IL-4, are also repressed by CIITA (46Gourley T.S. Chang C.H. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 2917-2921Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 48Sisk T.J. Gourley T. Roys S. Chang C.H. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 2511-2517Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). CIITA inhibits IL-4 gene transcription by competing with a transcription factor that interacts with the co-activator CBP/p300 (48Sisk T.J. Gourley T. Roys S. Chang C.H. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 2511-2517Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Most importantly, CIITA down-regulates collagen gene transcription through an interaction with CBP/p300 (49Zhu X.S. Ting J.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7078-7088Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). This report establishes that RFX1 homodimers, RFX1·RFX2 heterodimers, and RFX5 extracted from human fibroblast nuclei can form complexes on the normal unmethylated collagen transcription start site as well as on methylated sites. RFX5 complex binds when RFX1 and RFX2 are removed. Both RFX1 and RFX5 repress collagen gene expression in transfection andin vitro transcription assays. IFN-γ suppresses collagen gene expression by increasing the binding activity of RFX5 complex and CIITA at the collagen promoter. IFN-γ does not suppress collagen gene activity in cells with low amounts of RFX5 binding activity on the collagen site, suggesting that RFX5 binding recruits the CIITA protein. Rat fibroblast cells (FR) (CRL-1213, American Type Culture Collection, VA), human embryonic lung fibroblasts (IMR-90) (CCL-86, American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) and COS7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin G/streptomycin sulfate, 1% sodium pyruvate, and 1%l-glutamine. Whenever IFN-γ was added to cultures, cells were preincubated in low serum (0.4%) media for 1 h followed by addition of IFN-γ (1–500 units/ml media) or IFN-γ solvent buffer, as control, for 24 h. Rat IFN-γ (Sigma) was added to rat fibroblasts and human IFN-γ (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was added to human fibroblasts. Bisulfite modification followed by MS-SNuPE was used to analyze methylation of collagen at the +7 CpG site as previously described (50Clark S.J. Harrison J. Paul C.L. Frommer M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 2990-2997Crossref PubMed Scopus (1625) Google Scholar, 51Gonzalgo M.L. Jones P.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2529-2531Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). The bisulfite modification causes unmethylated cytosines (Cs) to be converted to uracil. Methylated cytosine is resistant to deamination. Briefly, genomic DNA (∼2 μg/50 μl) isolated from human fibroblasts was incubated with 5.5 μl of 2 n NaOH at 37 °C for 15 min. Hydroquinone (0.5 mm) and sodium metabisulfite (2.6 m at pH 5) were added to DNA, and the DNA was incubated at 50 °C for 20 h. The DNA was purified and extracted in water then desulfonated by incubation for 5 min in 0.3m NaOH at room temperature. The DNA was reprecipitated and suspended in 20 μl of Tris-HCl (10 mm)/EDTA (1 mm) buffer, pH 8. PCR was used to amplify the modified DNA replacing uracil residues with thymine. Primers were designed using a converted sequence (Cs to Ts) in a region that did not contain any possible methylation sites. Separate primers were designed to amplify the coding strand (−65 to +151) or the template strand (−71 to +144) (see Table I). The PCR product was separated on 2% low melting agarose gel and purified using a Qiagen gel extraction kit (Qiagen).Table IPrimers for bisulfite modification and MS-SNuPE assayNamePosition(5′→3′) Sequence1-aThe PCR and MS-SNuPE primers are the predicted bisulfite-converted collagen sequences from COL1A2 sequences in the GenBank™.

The PCR primers have been chosen from regions that do not contain any methylation sites (CpGs). Open table in a new tab For determining methylation at individual sites, we used methylation-sensitive single-nucleotide primer extension (MS-SNuPE). This method established whether the nucleotide at +7 remained a C (methylated) residue or had been converted to T (unmethylated). A control primer was used to establish whether conversion of C to T was completed. The MS-SNuPE primers are given in TableI, and their relationship to the collagen gene is diagramed in Fig. 1 A. The reaction mixture contained gel-purified PCR fragments, primers, and 1 μCi of radiolabeled [32P]dCTP or [32P]dTTP for coding strand and [32P]dGTP or [32P]dATP for template strand in 1X Taq polymerase buffer (Promega, Madison, WI). After denaturation at 95 °C for 3 min, the primers were annealed at 40 °C for 2 min and extended at 72 °C for 1 min with Taq polymerase (1 unit) (Promega). The reaction was stopped by addition of 10 μl of stop buffer. The reaction products were heated at 95 °C for 2 min before loading onto a 15% acrylamide/7 m urea gel. The radioactivity of the specific bands were quantified by a Packard Instant Imager (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and pictured by autoradiography. The percentage of methylation was calculated by the amount of radiolabeled dCTP or dGTP incorporated into the primer divided by the total radioactivity (Fig.1 B). Nuclear extracts were prepared according to Dignam et al. (52Dignam J.D. Martin P.L. Shastry B.S. Roeder R.G. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 582-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (746) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Extractions of protein from isolated nuclei were performed at higher salt conditions than normal using 500 mm NaCl or 420 mm NaCl rather than 350 mm NaCl in buffer C. All buffers contained the phosphatase inhibitor orthovanadate (1 mm) and the protease inhibitors leupeptin (40 μg/ml), aprotinin (200 μg/ml), pepstatin A (40 μg/ml), and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (0.5 mm). Protein concentration of the extracts was determined by the Bradford reagent using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Oligonucleotides containing collagen sequences (−1 to +20) with and without methylation or methylated DNA binding protein/RFX consensus sequences with HindIII overhangs were synthesized (Oligo Etc., Gulford, CT and Integrated DNA Technology, Coralville, IA). The oligonucleotide sequences used for gel shift assay and competition assays are given in Table II. Complementary strands were annealed to make double-stranded oligonucleotides. Hemi-methylated probes were produced by annealing a methylated coding strand oligonucleotide or a methylated template strand oligonucleotide with the corresponding complementary unmethylated sequences. Annealing was performed at 95 °C for 7 min in presence of 200 mm NaCl and cooled to room temperature overnight. The double-stranded oligonucleotides were radiolabeled using the [α-32P]dATP and the Klenow fragment to fill in theHindIII overhangs.Table IISequences of collagen genes, RFX consensus oligonucleotides, and luciferase primer used in gel shift and transcription experimentsNamePosition(5′→3′) Sequenceα2(I) −1 to +20α2(1) First exon sequenceaagcttAGCACCACGGCAGCAGGAGGTTCGTGGTGCCGTCGTCCTCCAttcgaaX2-aSequences reported by Katan-Khaykovichl et al.

For DNA mobility shift assay, the binding reaction was performed for 30 min at room temperature in 20 μl of binding buffer containing ∼20,000 cpm/20 fmol of labeled probe, 1 μg of poly(dI·dC)·poly(dI·dC) and nuclear extract containing 5.0 μg of protein. Double-stranded oligonucleotides were used as competitors as described previously. Separation of free radiolabeled DNA from DNA-protein complexes was carried out on a 4–5% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel with a standard Tris borate electrophoresis buffer (TBE) at 300 V at a cold temperature (4 °C). Autoradiography was performed by overnight exposure to Kodak Biomax film (Eastman Kodak Co.). The intensities of the bands were quantified using Packard Instant Imager (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Nuclear extracts and antibodies were preincubated for 20 min at room temperature before the radiolabeled probe was added followed by another 20-min incubation with the probe. RFXB/RFXANK, CIITA, and RFX1-RFX3 antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA. The anti-RFX5 antibodies 191 (C terminus) and 194 (amino acids 320–494) were purchased from Rockland, Gilbertsville, PA. Human fibroblasts or rat fibroblasts were treated with IFN-γ for 24 h before harvesting. Proteins were extracted using radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (1× phosphate-buffered saline, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate) with freshly added phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (100 μg/ml) and aprotinin (5–10 trypsin inhibitory units/ml). The amount of protein was determined by the Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad). Proteins in extracts were separated by 10% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with prestained markers (Bio-Rad) used for estimating molecular weight and the efficiency of transfer to blots. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad) in a Mini-Trans-Blot Cell (Bio-Rad). The membranes were blocked with 5% milk powder at room temperature for 3 h and hybridized for 1 h to several antibodies (polyclonal antibody against RFX5 (194) (Rockland). CIITA (N-20), RFX1 (I-19), RFX2 (C-15), or RFX3 (T-17) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology)). After washing with buffer for three times, the membranes were incubated with appropriate secondary antibodies, either anti-goat IgG (Sigma) or anti-rabbit IgG (Amersham Biosciences), for another 1 h at room temperature. Then protein blots were visualized using ECL reagent (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) on a Kodak image station (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Plasmid DNA was transfected by lipofection (LipofectAMINE, Invitrogen) 24 h after plating IMR-90 human fibroblasts (6 × 105) or FR rat fibroblasts (8 × 105) into 35-mm plates. Plasmids (pH20) containing the α2(I) promoter (−224 to +54) (53Goldberg H. Helaakoski T. Garrett L.A. Karsenty G. Pellegrino A. Lozano G. Maity S. de Crombrugghe B. J. Biol.

A reference plasmid, pCMV-GFP (0.1 μg, CLONTECH), containing the CMV immediate early promoter driving expression of the gene encoding the green fluorescent protein, was used to normalize transfection efficiency. In some instances, transfected cells were incubated for 24 h in media containing low serum (0.4%) with or without varying amounts (0.05–5 units/ml) of IFN-γ. Luciferase assays were performed under standard conditions (Luciferase kit, Promega, Madison, WI). Briefly, the cells were washed twice with PBS buffer and scraped with lysis reagent.

GPCRs contain a seven-TM helical structure essential for signal transduction in response to a large variety of sensory and hormonal signals. Primary structure comparison of GPCRs has shown that the second TM helix contains a highly conserved Asp residue, which is critical for agonist activation in these receptors. How conformational changes in TM2 relate to signal transduction by a GPCR is not known, because activation-induced conformational changes in TM2 helix have not been measured. Here we use modification of reporter cysteines to measure water accessibility at specific residues in TM2 of the type 1 receptor for the octapeptide hormone angiotensin II. Activation-dependent changes in the accessibility of Cys76 on TM2 were measured in constitutively activated mutants. These changes were directly correlated with measurement of function, establishing the link between physical changes in TM2 and function. Accessibility changes were measured at several consecutive residues on TM2, which suggest that TM2 undergoes a transmembrane movement in response to activation.

They contain a common structural feature characterized by seven transmembrane (TM) helices essential for signal transduction. Although marked variation in the structure of GPCRs is noted, ligand-induced activation of function is thought to involve a common molecular mechanism, rigid body movement of TM helices, which leads to the activation of a specific guanine nucleotide-binding protein (G-protein). Previous studies of rhodopsin and other GPCRs demonstrated that activation induces relative movement of TM3, TM6, and TM7 (2Farrens D.L. Altenbach C. Yang K. Hubbell W.L. Khorana H.G.

The type 1 (AT1) receptor for the octapeptide hormone angiotensin II (Ang II) is a member of the GPCR family (see Fig. 1below). It is an important target for drug development, because abnormalities in its function are linked to hypertension, water-electrolyte imbalance, hyperaldosteronism, cardiac hypertrophy, and heart failure (10Peach M.J. Physiol. Rev. 1977; 57: 313-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (1235) Google Scholar). The AT1 receptor is coupled to G-protein, Gq/11, or in some cases Gi, Gs, or Gα-12. Activation by Ang II results in phospholipase C activation and inositol phosphate (IP) production, leading to Ang II-specific physiological responses (11Sasaki K. Yamano Y. Bardhan S. Iwai N.

Nature. 1991; 351: 233-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (1171) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanism of activation of AT1 receptor has been proposed to involve conformational changes in the TM domain similar to those in other GPCRs (13Karnik S.S. Husain A. Graham R.M. Drugs, Enzymes and Receptors of the Renin-Angiotensin System: Celebrating a Century of Discovery. Harwood Academic Press, Amsterdam, The Netherlands2000: 117-130Google Scholar). This was based on the finding that Ang II-binding involves interactions with TM3, TM5, TM6, and TM7 (Fig.1). Interaction of agonist switch residues, Ang II-Tyr4 with Asn111 and Ang II-Phe8 with His256 of the AT1receptor, releases the receptor from an inactive state (R), leading to an activated state (R*) (13Karnik S.S.

However, the nature of the conformational changes essential for activation of the AT1 receptor are not known. In this study, by adopting reporter cysteine accessibility mapping (RCAM) studies (also called SCAM, substituted cysteine accessibility mapping), we found that constitutive activation of AT1receptor induces the movement of the TM2 helix. We observed a decrease in the accessibility of TM2 to water specifically in the constitutively activated mutants of the AT1 receptor, suggesting that activation of the receptor leads to changes in water accessibility of TM2.

Membranes expressing the wild-type (WT) or the mutant receptor were incubated with 300 pm125I-[Sar1,Ile8]Ang II for 1 h at 22 °C in a 250-μl volume. Nonspecific binding of the radioligand was measured in the presence of 1 mm127I-[Sar1,Ile8]Ang II. The binding experiments were stopped by filtering the binding mixture through Whatman GF/C glass fiber filters, which were extensively washed further with binding buffer. The bound ligand fraction was determined from the counts per minute (cpm) remaining on the membrane. Binding kinetics values were determined using the computer program Ligand. TheK d and B max values represent the mean ± S.E. of three to five independent determinations. Aliquots of cell membranes (20 μl) were incubated with or without MTS reagents at the stated concentrations (0.1–12.5 mm) at 22 °C for the indicated times (2–10 min) in 20 mm HEPES buffer (pH 7.4). The reaction mix was then diluted 75-fold with cold buffer to stop the reaction and centrifuged for 10 min at 16,000 × g at 4 °C then resuspended in 200 μl. A 150-μl aliquot was used for125I-[Sar1,Ile8]Ang II binding analysis. The percent inhibition of125I-[Sar1,Ile8]Ang II binding was calculated using the formula, {1 − [(specific binding after MTS reagent)/(specific binding without reagent)]} × 100%. The values represent the mean ± S.E. of 4–10 independent determinations. Semi-confluent COS1 cells transfected in 60-mm Petri dishes were labeled for 24 h with [3H]myoinositol (1.5 μCi/ml; specific activity, 22 μCi/mol) (Amersham Biosciences), at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. The labeled cells were washed three times with Hanks' balanced salt solution and incubated with Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 10 mm LiCl for 20 min. Agonists were then added, and incubation continued for another 45 min at 37 °C. At the end of incubation, the medium was removed, and the total soluble IP was extracted from the cells by the perchloric acid extraction method, as described previously (14Noda K. Feng Y.H. Liu X.P.

RCAM measures relative changes in water accessibility of site-directed reporter cysteines (Cys) in the inactive and constitutively active states of the AT1 receptor. Highly reactive, sulfhydryl-specific methanethiosulfonate derivatives (MTS reagents) were used to modify water-exposed, site-directed reporter Cys residues. MTS reagents are >3000-fold more soluble in aqueous than lipophilic solvents (20Akabas M.H. Stauffer D.A., Xu, M. Karlin A. Science. 1992; 258: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar). Furthermore, these MTS reagents react a billion times faster with the thiolate anion species than with the un-ionized thiol (21Roberts D.D. Lewis S.D. Ballou D.P. Olson S.T. Shafer J.A. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 5595-5601Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Only water-accessible thiol groups ionize. Therefore, MTS reagent's reaction is specific for water-exposed Cys-sulfhydryl (-SH) groups in the receptor and does not affect buried, lipid-exposed, or disulfide-bonded Cys residues. Reaction with MTS reagents results in the addition of a charged group (either a -sulfonylethylammonium group or a -sulfonylethyltrimethylammonium group) onto the reacted Cys to form a mixed disulfide bond. The modification could block the receptor-ligand interaction either physically (size addition, ∼4–6 Å) or via electrostatic repulsion. Because the MTS reagents are ∼10 times smaller than Ang II, these reagents are capable of reaching ligand-pocket depths beyond that accessible to Ang II. This mapping method has previously been used in the analysis of several types of integral membrane proteins, ion channels, transporters, and other GPCRs (6Javitch J.A., Fu, D. Liapakis G. Chen J. J.

Exposure to positively charged MTSEA+ and MTSET+ reagents for <10 min abolished specific binding of the antagonist125I-[Sar1,Ile8]Ang II to the wild-type AT1 receptor by nearly 70% (Fig.2 A). The kinetics of inhibition is dependent on size and concentration of the MTS reagent and the time of reaction. In contrast, the negatively charged MTSES− and the uncharged methyl-MTS did not inhibit binding. These two reagents reacted poorly, because subsequent reaction with MTSEA+ appeared to be normal (data not shown). The inhibition of antagonist binding by MTS reagents was irreversible and led to a decrease in the maximal number of binding sites (B max) without a significant change in binding affinity (Fig. 2 B). Dithiothreitol, commonly used for reversing the MTS inactivation, could not be used because it inactivates the native AT1 receptor. In the presence of125I-[Sar1,Ile8]Ang II, the AT1 receptor was protected against reaction with MTSEA+ (Fig. 2 C) and MTSET+ (not shown), suggesting that one or more Cys residues in the ligand binding pocket react with MTS reagents to inhibit antagonist binding. The fast phase of inhibitory reactions with both MTSEA+ and MTSET+ was nearly complete in 5 min (Fig. 2 D). The observed B max changes appear to be due to the MTS reaction with Cys residues in the aqueous crevice in the TM domain of the receptor that forms the pocket for Ang II. Similar conclusions have been reached in the study of dopamine and β2-adrenergic receptors (6Javitch J.A., Fu, D. Liapakis G. Chen J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18546-18549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). To identify the MTS-sensitive native Cys residue(s) of the AT1 receptor, we replaced Cys76 and Cys289 with alanine. These two residues located in the extracellular half of TM domain are candidates, more likely than the remaining three TM domain Cys residues, for reacting with MTS reagents (Fig. 1). We also constructed a CYS−AT1 receptor mutant, which lacked all non-disulfide-bonded Cys residues for comparison. The binding affinity of these three mutants was similar to that of the WT receptor for125I-[Sar1,Ile8]Ang II (TableI), indicating that Ala substitutions did not affect ligand interaction. In both the WT and C289A mutant receptors, MTSEA+ inhibited antagonist binding by about 25%. In contrast, binding in the C76A and CYS− mutants was resistant to reaction with MTSEA+ and MTSET+ (Table I and Fig. 2 D). The reaction of WT and these three mutant receptors with MTSET+ exhibited the same pattern (Fig. 2 D). Based on these observations, we conclude that inhibition of [Sar1,Ile8]Ang II binding is due to reaction of MTS reagents with Cys76 in the TM2 helix and the remaining free Cys residues are not involved.Table ILigand affinity, B max , and inhibition by MTS reagents of wild-type and reporter Cys mutant AT 1 receptorsReceptor K d [Sar1,Ile8]Ang II B maxInhibition of binding1-aAnalysis of variance showed (*) significant increase (p < 0.05) and (**) significant decrease (p < 0.05), in the reaction with MTSEA+ and MTSET+ compared to WT.

To map activation-induced conformational changes, we compared the accessibility of the native Cys residues in the WT and gain-of-function mutants. Previous studies demonstrated that the N111S, N111A, and N111G mutants of the AT1 receptor are constitutively activated (14Noda K. Feng Y.H. Liu X.P. Saad Y. Husain A. Karnik S.S.

Chem. 1999; 274: 7103-7110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Fig.3 illustrates the finding that the smaller-residue mutations cause a graded elevation of agonist-independent basal intracellular IP accumulation in transfected COS1 cells. In an earlier study we also substituted Asn111with larger residues (15Feng Y.H. Miura S. Husain A. Karnik S.S. Biochemistry. 1999; 37: 15791-15798Crossref Scopus (85) Google Scholar). For instance, as shown in Fig. 3, Ile111 substitution suppressed basal activity when compared with the WT. The measured basal activity in the transfected COS1 cells increased linearly with increasing receptor expression. However, there was a progressive increase in basal activity of the mutants in the following rank order from lowest to highest: N111I (slope, 470 ± 40 cpm/pmol/mg of protein), WT (slope, 850 ± 75 cpm/pmol/mg of protein), N111A (slope, 1,750 ± 280 cpm/pmol/mg of protein), N111S (slope, 2,260 ± 300 cpm/pmol/mg of protein), and N111G (slope, 5,870 ± 550 cpm/pmol/mg of protein). The agonist-dependent activity was nearly the same in the WT, N111A, N111S, and N111G mutants (slope, 15,550 ± 1,500 cpm/pmol/mg of protein) but was significantly reduced in the N111I mutant (5,400 ± 500 cpm/pmol/mg of protein). The data indicated a progressively increased constitutive activation as the residue size at position 111 of the AT1 receptor decreased. This finding is consistent with previous studies from our laboratory (14Noda K. Feng Y.H. Liu X.P. Saad Y. Husain A. Karnik S.S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16435-16442Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 15Feng Y.H. Miura S. Husain A. Karnik S.S.

Chem. 1999; 274: 7103-7110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The WT and N111I mutant receptors served as controls for the inactive state. The treatment of the most activated mutant, N111G, with 2.5 mm MTSEA for 2 min did not affect the binding of the radioligand 125I-[Sar1,Ile8]Ang II (Fig. 3). Higher concentrations of MTSEA, however, inhibited the binding of 125I-[Sar1,Ile8]Ang II to this mutant (Fig. 4). To probe for conformational rearrangements in the series of constitutively activated mutants, MTSEA inhibition of the125I-[Sar1,Ile8]Ang II binding was measured. The following rank order of MTSEA inhibition was found, N111G < N111S < N111A < WT < N111I (Fig. 3). The fractional inhibition caused by 2.5 mm MTSEA correlated significantly with calculated basal activity (r = 0.99,p < 0.05). It is possible to assume that the observed changes in accessibility in these constitutively active mutants arise because of combinatorial changes in accessibility of Cys residues. To evaluate this possibility, we tested double mutants, C76A/N111G, C76A/N111A, and C76A/N111I, under identical conditions. The double mutants were MTSEA-insensitive (Fig. 3), implying that Cys76 is necessary and sufficient for conferring MTSEA inhibition in all mutants. We conclude that the accessibility of Cys76 is changed in the constitutively activated state, perhaps due to motion of the TM2 helix coupled to the activation of the receptor. In the C76A mutant we substituted TM2 residues, from Ala73 to Phe77 with Cys, one at a time (Table I). A five-residue stretch is sufficient to infer the ligand-exposed phase, assuming that TM2 adopts the α-helical conformation. These mutations caused a moderate change in binding affinity for [Sar1,Ile8]Ang II. Reduction in the binding affinity of the non-peptide antagonist losartan was within 10-fold (data not shown). The B max values for these mutants varied by ∼2-fold. These findings are consistent with preservation of the geometry of the ligand binding pocket. The functional data for the activation of the receptor is given in TableII. Substitution of Ala73, Leu75, Cys76, and Phe77 did not significantly alter agonist activation. Substitution of Asp74 with Cys hampered agonist activation, although the affinity for the agonist was not significantly altered. The observed defect for the D74C mutation is consistent with previous reports on the D74A and D74N mutations (19Bihoreau C. Monnot C. Davies E. Teutsch B. Bernstein K.E. Corvol P. Clauser E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5133-5137Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). A similar role in agonist activation is reported in other GPCRs for this highly conserved residue in TM2. When these mutations were combined with the constitutively activated state, the effect on the constitutive activation was consistent with the phenotype displayed by each mutation in the WT receptor (see TableII).Table IIEffect of Cys substitution of TM2 residues on functionTM2 mutationTM3 mutationNone (Asn111)N111GBasalAgonistBasalAgonistNone6 ± 2100 ± 542 ± 2104 ± 7A73C, C76A6 ± 370 ± 626 ± 288 ± 4D74C, C76A5 ± 47 ± 319 ± 318 ± 3L75C, C76A5 ± 293 ± 342 ± 397 ± 6C76A3 ± 395 ± 839 ± 399 ± 5C76A, F77C5 ± 198 ± 158 ± 4135 ± 5The values represent total inositol phosphates measured in COS1 cells transfected with WT and mutant AT1 receptor expression plasmids (10 μg of DNA/107 cells) in three independent experiments.

Both MTSEA+ and MTSET+ inhibited the D74C and L75C mutants significantly more than the WT (Cys76) (TableI), suggesting that the side chains of the corresponding WT residues are exposed to the ligand pocket. Longer reactions with both MTSEA+ and MTSET+ indicated that D74C is most reactive followed by L75C and Cys76, respectively. The inhibition of D74C is consistent with findings from previous mutagenesis studies that indicate that Asp74 faces the ligand pocket in the AT1"

In the present study we have used reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation experiments to determine which of the two subunits of core DNA polymerase δ, the 125-kDa catalytic subunit or the 50-kDa small subunit, directly interacts with PCNA. We found that PCNA co-immunoprecipitated with human p50, as well as calf thymus DNA polymerase δ heterodimer, but not with p125 alone, suggesting that PCNA directly interacts with p50 but not with p125. A PCNA-binding motif, similar to the sliding clamp-binding motif of bacteriophage RB69 DNA polymerase, was identified in the N terminus of p50. A 22-amino acid oligopeptide containing this sequence (MRPFL) was shown to bind PCNA by far Western analysis and to compete with p50 for binding to PCNA in co-immunoprecipitation experiments. The binding of p50 to PCNA was inhibited by p21, suggesting that the two proteins compete for the same binding site on PCNA.

O'Donnell M. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1996; 87: 297-306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar), suggesting that PCNA may coordinate DNA replication with DNA repair as well as with cell cycle progression by functioning as a regulatory target (1Waga S. Stillman B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 721-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar, 24Warbrick E. BioEssays. 2000; 22: 997-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). Despite the fact that PCNA was identified as a processivity factor for pol δ and a replication protein essential for in vitroSV40 DNA replication nearly 15 years ago (8Prelich G. Tan C.-K. Kostura M. Mathews M.B., So, A.G. Downey K.M. Stillman B. Nature. 1987; 326: 517-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (893) Google Scholar, 25Prelich G. Kostura M. Marshak D.R. Mathews M. Stillman B. Nature. 1987; 326: 471-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar), the site on pol δ that interacts with PCNA is still unresolved, as is the quaternary structure of the pol δ species that interacts with PCNA. Purified pol δ from calf thymus tissue has been shown to be a heterodimer comprised of a catalytic subunit of 125 kDa containing the DNA polymerase and 3′ to 5′ exonuclease active sites, and a 50-kDa subunit of unknown function (26Lee M.Y. Tan C.-K. Downey K.M. So A.G. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 1906-1913Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 27Ng L. Tan C.-K. Downey K.M. Fisher P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11699-11704Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The heterodimeric core enzyme (p125/p50), which is essentially distributive, can be transformed into a highly processive DNA polymerase by PCNA (8Prelich G. Tan C.-K. Kostura M.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 1090-1099Crossref Scopus (57) Google Scholar), suggesting that functional interaction of pol δ with PCNA is mediated through interaction with either the 125- or the 50-kDa subunit of the enzyme or with both. In contrast, highly purified pol δ from Schizosaccharomyces pombe is composed of four subunits: the homologues of p125 (Pol3/Cdc6) and p50 (Cdc1) and two additional subunits, Cdc27 and Cdm 1 (29Zuo S. Bermudez V. Zhang G. Kelman Z. Hurwitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5153-5162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, active pol δ can be isolated either as a heterodimer composed of the homologues of mammalian p125 and p50, i.e. Pol3 and Pol31, or as a heterotrimer with, in addition to Pol3 and Pol31, Pol32, the homologue of S. pombe Cdc27 (30Gerik K.J., Li, X.Y. Pautz A. Burgers P.M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19747-19755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Interestingly, althoughcdc27+ is an essential gene in S. pombe (31MacNeill S.A. Moreno S. Reynolds N. Nurse P. Fantes P.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4613-4628Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), POl32 is not an essential gene in S. cerevisiae (30Gerik K.J., Li, X.Y. Pautz A. Burgers P.M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19747-19755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Recently, it was reported that a homologue ofS. pombe Cdc27 or S. cerevisiae Pol32 is present in preparations of mammalian pol δ, i.e. p66 (32Hughes P. Tratner J. Ducous M. Piard K. Baldacci G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 2108-2114Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Studies aimed at identifying the subunit of pol δ that interacts with PCNA have produced conflicting answers. Binding studies using recombinant human p125 and PCNA have demonstrated direct interaction between these two polypeptides by protein overlay experiments using biotinylated PCNA and by biochemical cross-linking experiments (33Zhang P., Mo, J.Y.

Similar studies with S. cerevisiae (30Gerik K.J., Li, X.Y. Pautz A. Burgers P.M.J. J. Biol.

A third subunit of pol δ, initially identified in S. pombe(Cdc27), was found to interact with Cdc1 (homologue of mammalian p50 and S. cerevisiae Pol31) and to bind PCNA through a consensus PCNA-binding motif, suggesting that the third subunit mediates the interaction between pol δ and PCNA (31MacNeill S.A.

EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1108-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Homologues of Cdc27 in S. cerevisiae (Pol32) and mammalian cells (p66) also contain a consensus PCNA-binding motif (30Gerik K.J., Li, X.Y. Pautz A. Burgers P.M.J. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 1571-1580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (35) Google Scholar) sources have shown that DNA synthesis catalyzed by p125 alone is not significantly stimulated by PCNA. On the other hand, PCNA was shown to stimulate the activity and processivity of the recombinant human heterodimer to the same extent as the native two-subunit enzyme isolated from calf thymus (28Zhou J.-Q., He, H. Tan C.-K. Downey K.M. So A.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 1090-1099Crossref Scopus (57) Google Scholar), suggesting the possibility that the interaction of PCNA with pol δ is mediated through the small subunit. Similarly, heterodimeric pol δ from S. cerevisiae (Pol3/Pol31) was found to be highly processive in the presence of PCNA (43Burgers P.M.J. Gerik K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19756-19762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). In fact, heterodimeric pol δ was found to be as processive as heterotrimeric pol δ (Pol3/Pol31/Pol32), the only difference being that the latter enzyme required considerably lower concentrations of PCNA for highly processive synthesis (43Burgers P.M.J. Gerik K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19756-19762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). In contrast, recent functional studies in which recombinant human enzymes containing either two subunits (p125/p50) or three subunits (p125/p50/p66) were directly compared demonstrated that only the three-subunit enzyme could be stimulated by PCNA (34Shikata K. Ohta S. Yamada K Obuse C. Yoshikawa H. Tsurimoto T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2001; 129: 699-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 35Ducoux M Urbach S. Baldacci G Hubscher U Koundrioukoff S. Christensen J. Hughes P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 49258-49266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The reasons for these discrepancies are not clear. In the present study we have used antibodies to the individual subunits of mammalian pol δ and PCNA to examine the interactions among these polypeptides by co-immunoprecipitation to identify the PCNA-binding site on pol δ. The plasmids pT7/hPCNA and pETp21His were the kind gifts of Drs. Bruce Stillman and Shou Waga (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY). The plasmid pET16b-p50 was constructed by subcloning the human p50 cDNA (44Zhang J. Tan C.-K. McManus B. Downey K.M. So A.G. Genomics. 1995; 29: 179-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) into theNdeI site of pET16b (Novagen). Calf thymus pol δ was purified through step 7 as described by Downey and So (45Downey K.M. So A.G. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 84-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Recombinant human p125 and p50 were overexpressed in Sf9 cells using the baculoviruses AcN-p125-14 and AcN-p50-1 and purified as described previously (28Zhou J.-Q., He, H. Tan C.-K. Downey K.M. So A.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 1090-1099Crossref Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 39Zhou J.-Q. Tan C.-K., So, A.G. Downey K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29740-29745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Recombinant human PCNA was produced in Escherichia coliusing the plasmid pT7/hPCNA and purified as described in Brush et al. (46Brush G.S. Kelly T.J. Stillman B. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 522-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Polyhistidine-tagged p21 (His-p21) was expressed inE. coli using the plasmid pETp21His and purified according to Waga et al. (19Waga S. Hannon G.J. Beach D. Stillman B. Nature. 1994; 364: 574-578Crossref Scopus (1591) Google Scholar). Polyhistidine-tagged p50 (His-p50) was expressed in E. coli using the plasmid pET16b-p50. The fusion protein was purified by binding to a nickel-chelate-nitrilotriacetic acid column (Qiagen) in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 7.5% glycerol, and 2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. After washing with the same buffer containing 40 mm imidazole, His-p50 was eluted with the same buffer containing 400 mm imidazole and dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 10 mm Na2HPO4, 1.8 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.5) containing 2 mm dithiothreitol. Human autoantiserum to PCNA was a generous gift of Dr. Irving Kushner (Cleveland Metropolitan General Hospital, Cleveland, OH). Rabbit antibodies to the N-terminal one-third of human p125, expressed as a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein, were prepared as described previously (28Zhou J.-Q., He, H. Tan C.-K. Downey K.M. So A.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 1090-1099Crossref Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Polyclonal antibodies to His-p50 were raised in rabbits. IgGs from human anti-PCNA, rabbit anti-Hisp50, and rabbit anti-glutathione S-transferase p125 were purified on protein A-Sepharose 4B (Sigma) and then coupled to protein A-Sepharose 4B beads using dimethyl pimelidate (Pierce) according to Harlow and Lane (47Harlow E. Lane D. Using Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1999: 321-325Google Scholar). Control beads were prepared by cross-linking preimmune rabbit IgG or normal human IgG to protein A-Sepharose beads. Monoclonal anti-PCNA antibody (PC-10) was from Sigma. Monoclonal anti-p125 antibody (clone 22) was from BD Bioscience. Chicken anti-p50 antibodies were prepared by Alpha Diagnostic International (San Antonio, TX). Peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG and peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-chicken IgY were from Jackson Immunoresearch (West Grove, PA). Purified recombinant proteins were mixed with antibody-linked protein A-Sepharose beads at 4 °C for 3 h in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.2% Nonidet P-40 (200 μl of total volume). After extensive washing with the same buffer, the beads were mixed with an equal volume of 1× Laemmli SDS sample buffer and denatured at 90 °C for 10 min. The proteins in the supernatants were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and electroblotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad). After incubation for 2 h at room temperature with blocking buffer, Tris-buffered saline (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl) containing 5% nonfat dry milk, the membrane was incubated with primary antibody for 2 h at room temperature in the same buffer, washed extensively with Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20 (TBST), and incubated with peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h. After extensive washing with TBST, the proteins were detected by SuperSignal enhanced chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce). Peptides or proteins were slot-blotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad) and processed as described by He et al. (48He H. Tan C.-K. Downey K.M. So A.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11979-11984Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Wild type p50 peptide (amino acids 51–72) (AHIYATRLIQMRPFLENRAQQH), mutated p50 peptide (F64A,L65A) (AHIYATRLIQMRPAAENRAQQH), an unrelated peptide (AGSYIVPEDKREMWMACIKEAA), and p21 peptide (amino acids 139–160) (GRKRRQTSMTDFYHSKRRLIFS) were synthesized by ResGen (Huntsville, AL). The protein concentration was determined using the Bio-Rad DC protein assay kit with bovine serum albumin as a standard. To identify the subunit(s) of pol δ that interact(s) with PCNA, we have used purified recombinant human p125, p50, and PCNA and polyclonal antibodies to each of these polypeptides linked to protein A-Sepharose beads to detect co-immunoprecipitation of PCNA with one or both of the subunits of the pol δ core enzyme. As shown in Fig.1 A, anti-PCNA beads co-immunoprecipitated p50 in the presence but not in the absence of PCNA, and the amount of p50 co-immunoprecipitated increased with increasing amounts of PCNA in the reaction mixture. To confirm the association of PCNA with p50, reciprocal immunoprecipitation experiments were carried out using anti-p50 polyclonal antibodies. As shown in Fig. 1 B, anti-p50 beads co-immunoprecipitated PCNA in the presence but not in the absence of p50. These experiments provide strong evidence for a direct interaction of p50 and PCNA. As shown in Fig. 1 C, anti-p125 antibodies failed to co-immunoprecipitate PCNA in the presence of purified p125; however, anti-p125 antibodies effectively co-immunoprecipitated PCNA in the presence of calf thymus pol δ, i.e. when p125 is complexed with p50 in the heterodimeric core enzyme. Reciprocal experiments were carried out to further substantiate that the interaction of PCNA with p125 is mediated through p50. As shown in Fig. 1 D, anti-PCNA beads failed to co-immunoprecipitate recombinant p125 in the presence of PCNA but efficiently co-immunoprecipitated p125 when it was complexed with p50 in native calf thymus pol δ. These experiments suggest that the interaction of PCNA with p125 is mediated through p50. It has been shown that p21 and human pol δ both bind to the interdomain connector loop of PCNA (6Gulbis J.M. Kelman Z. Hurwitz J. O'Donnell M. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1996; 87: 297-306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar, 49Zhang P. Sun Y. Hsu H. Zhang L. Zhang Y Lee M.Y.W.T. J.

Stillman B. Nature. 1994; 364: 574-578Crossref Scopus (1591) Google Scholar, 20Flores-Rozas H. Kelman Z. Dean F.B. Pan Z.-Q. Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. O'Donnell M. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6655-6659Crossref Scopus (417) Google Scholar). If the interaction of PCNA with pol δ is indeed mediated through p50, one would expect that the binding of p50 to PCNA would be disrupted by the addition of p21. That this is the case is shown in Fig. 2. The addition of molar ratios of p21 to PCNA monomer greater than 1:1 resulted in inhibition of binding of p50 to PCNA, and complete disruption was achieved when the molar ratio of p21 to PCNA exceeded 3:1 (Fig. 2 A). The addition of an oligopeptide containing the p21 PCNA-binding motif also inhibited the binding of PCNA to p50 (Fig. 2 B), and the p21 peptide was nearly as efficient as the p21 protein in inhibiting PCNA binding to p50, i.e.binding was ∼50% inhibited at 22 nm p21 protein and 35 nm p21 peptide (Fig. 2 C). It has been demonstrated that p21 effectively competes with a number of replication/repair proteins such as flap endonuclease 1 (50Warbrick E. Lane D.P. Glover D.M. Cox L.S. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2313-2321Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) and DNA ligase 1 (9Levin D.S. Bai W. Yao N. O'Donnell M. Tomkinson A.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12863-12868Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), repair proteins such as XPG (14Gary R. Ludwig D.L. Cornelius H.L. MacInnes M.A. Park M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24522-24529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), as well as the postreplication processing protein DNA (cytosine-5) methyl transferase (15Chuang L.S.H.

Science. 1997; 277: 1996-2000Crossref PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar), all of which share a consensus p21-like PCNA-binding motif, for binding to PCNA at the interdomain connector loop. The observation that p21 can dissociate the p50-PCNA complex suggests that the PCNA-binding motif of p50 targets the same site on PCNA as p21. Examination of the amino acid sequence of human p50 (44Zhang J. Tan C.-K. McManus B. Downey K.M. So A.G. Genomics. 1995; 29: 179-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) did not identify the consensus eight-amino acid PCNA-binding motif (Q1 XX(I/L/M)4 XX(F/H)7(F/Y)8) originally identified in p21 and found in most proteins that interact with PCNA (24Warbrick E. BioEssays. 2000; 22: 997-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar, 51Warbrick E. BioEssays. 1998; 20: 195-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). However, a hydrophobic five-amino acid sequence (MRPFL) that is homologous to a recently identified motif in the C termini of RB69 DNA polymerase (LFDMF) and T4 DNA polymerase (LDFLF) and that is necessary for interaction of these polymerases with their respective sliding clamps (52Shamoo Y. Steitz T.A. Cell. 1999; 99: 155-166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar) was identified in human p50. However, the motif was found at the N terminus (residues 61–65) rather than the C terminus of p50. Similar to the sliding clamp-binding sites of p21 and RB69 DNA polymerase, the p50 sequence is also in a helical conformation. To determine whether the MRPFL sequence in human p50 indeed represents a PCNA-binding motif, far Western analysis was carried out. A 22-amino acid peptide containing the putative PCNA-binding motif was synthesized, as was a mutated peptide, an unrelated peptide, and the p21 peptide as a positive control. The peptides, along with p50 protein and p21 protein, were slot-blotted to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, overlaid with PCNA, and probed with a monoclonal antibody to PCNA. The results (Fig. 3) demonstrated that the peptide containing MRPFL did interact with PCNA, whereas the mutated peptide and the unrelated peptide did not. Although the p50 peptide, the p21 peptide, and p21 protein bound PCNA, p50 protein did not, possibly because of denaturation or improper folding of the protein on the membrane. To further examine whether the interaction of p50 with PCNA is mediated through the sequence motif MRPFL, we investigated the effects of the addition of increasing amounts of the oligopeptide containing the identified PCNA-binding motif on the interaction of p50 with PCNA in co-immunoprecipitation experiments (Fig.4). As shown in Fig. 4 A, the p50 peptide, but not the mutated peptide in which residues Phe and Leu are substituted by alanines, effectively blocked the binding of p50 to PCNA. A 50% inhibition of binding was achieved at 200 nmpeptide (Fig. 4 B), corresponding to a molar ratio of p50 peptide to p50 protein of 10:1. These results establish that the MRPFL motif is responsible for the binding of p50 to PCNA. In this report we have demonstrated that PCNA interacts directly with the small subunit of mammalian pol δ (p50) by co-immunoprecipitation of these two proteins using polyclonal antibodies to each of them. We have further demonstrated, using polyclonal antibodies to either p125 or PCNA, that the catalytic subunit can only be co-immunoprecipitated with PCNA when it is complexed with p50 in heterodimeric pol δ and not when it exists as a single subunit. These results suggest that PCNA does not directly interact with the catalytic subunit and that the interaction between pol δ and its sliding clamp is mediated through the small subunit. The demonstration of a direct intera"
https://openalex.org/W1980000385,"Assembly of the SNARE complex is an essential step for membrane fusion and neurotransmitter release in neurons. The plasma membrane SNAREs syntaxin 1A and SNAP-25 (t-SNAREs) and the delivery-vesicle SNARE VAMP2 (or v-SNARE) contain the “SNARE regions” that essentially mediate SNARE pairing. Using site-directed spin labeling and EPR distance measurement we show that two identical copies of the SNARE region from syntaxin 1A intertwine as a coiled coil near the “ionic layer” region. The structure of the t-SNARE complex appears to be virtually identical to that of the ternary SNARE complex, except that VAMP2 is substituted to the second copy of syntaxin 1A. Furthermore, it appears that the coiled coil structure is maintained up to residue 259 of syntaxin 1A, identical to that of the ternary complex. These results are somewhat contradictory to the previous reports, suggesting that the t-SNARE complex has the disordered midsection (Xiao, W. Z., Poirier, M. A., Bennett, M. K., and Shin, Y. K. (2001) Nat. Struc. Biol. 8, 308–311) and the uncoiled C-terminal region (Margittai, M., Fasshauer, D., Pabst, S., Jahn, R., and Langen, R. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, 13169–13177). The newly refined structure of the t-SNARE complex provides a basis for the better understanding of the SNARE assembly process. It also provides possible structural-functional clues to the membrane fusion in the v-SNARE deleted fusion models. Assembly of the SNARE complex is an essential step for membrane fusion and neurotransmitter release in neurons. The plasma membrane SNAREs syntaxin 1A and SNAP-25 (t-SNAREs) and the delivery-vesicle SNARE VAMP2 (or v-SNARE) contain the “SNARE regions” that essentially mediate SNARE pairing. Using site-directed spin labeling and EPR distance measurement we show that two identical copies of the SNARE region from syntaxin 1A intertwine as a coiled coil near the “ionic layer” region. The structure of the t-SNARE complex appears to be virtually identical to that of the ternary SNARE complex, except that VAMP2 is substituted to the second copy of syntaxin 1A. Furthermore, it appears that the coiled coil structure is maintained up to residue 259 of syntaxin 1A, identical to that of the ternary complex. These results are somewhat contradictory to the previous reports, suggesting that the t-SNARE complex has the disordered midsection (Xiao, W. Z., Poirier, M. A., Bennett, M. K., and Shin, Y. K. (2001) Nat. Struc. Biol. 8, 308–311) and the uncoiled C-terminal region (Margittai, M., Fasshauer, D., Pabst, S., Jahn, R., and Langen, R. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, 13169–13177). The newly refined structure of the t-SNARE complex provides a basis for the better understanding of the SNARE assembly process. It also provides possible structural-functional clues to the membrane fusion in the v-SNARE deleted fusion models. soluble NSF acceptor protein acceptor N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor synaptosome-associated protein of 25 kDa target membrane SNARE vesicle SNARE vesicle-associated membrane protein Luria-Bertani glutathioneS-transferase nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (1-oxyl-2,2,5,5-tetramethyl- d-pyrroline-3-methyl)methanethiolsulfonate Neurotransmitter release at synapses requires fusion of synaptic vesicles with the target presynaptic plasma membrane. Synaptic membrane fusion is directly or indirectly mediated by a set of highly conserved proteins referred to as SNARE1 proteins (1Lin R.C. Scheller R.H. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 19-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar, 2Rothman J.E. Nature. 1994; 372: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (2007) Google Scholar, 3Jahn R. Südhof T.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 863-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (1021) Google Scholar). Target (t-) SNAREs syntaxin 1A and SNAP-25 are plasma membrane associate proteins. Syntaxin 1A is a transmembrane protein in which the soluble domain protrudes from the plasma membrane, whereas SNAP-25 is a soluble protein that is bound to the membrane by lipid chains. Two t-SNAREs spontaneously form the binary complex that might serve as an intermediate for the SNARE complex assembly (4Fasshauer D. Otto H. Eliason W.K. Jahn R. Brünger A.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28036-28041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Upon docking of the vesicle to the plasma membrane vesicle (v-) SNARE VAMP2 interacts with the t-SNARE complex to form a stable SNARE complex that perhaps leads to, or catalyzes, the fusion of two membranes. The highlight of the SNARE assembly is the formation of a parallel four-helix bundle (5Poirier M.A. Xiao W.Z. Macosko J.C. Chan C. Shin Y.K. Bennett M.K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 765-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar, 6Sutton R.B. Fasshauer D. Jahn R. Brünger A.T. Nature. 1998; 395: 347-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (1916) Google Scholar). The SNARE regions, which are the H3 domain of syntaxin 1A, two coiled-coil domains of SNAP-25, and a VAMP2 helical domain (7Poirier M.A. Hao J.C. Malkus P.N. Chan C. Moore M.F. King D.S. Bennett M.K.

Nature. 1998; 395: 347-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (1916) Google Scholar). The parallel arrangement of syntaxin 1A and VAMP2 would bring two transmembrane domains into close proximity, setting up the stage for membrane apposition (11Lin R.C. Scheller R.H. Neuron. 1997; 19: 1087-1094Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, 12Hanson P.I. Roth R. Morisaki H. Jahn R. Heuser J.E. Cell. 1997; 90: 523-535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar). Based on this structure, one can envision that the SNARE assembly forces the two membranes into apposition, promoting membrane fusion. The high stability of the complex perhaps implies that the energy released from the complex formation might be used to overcome the fusion energy barrier. A similar mechanism has been proposed for viral-cellular membrane fusion systems such as flu hemagglutinin and human immunodeficiency virus gp41 (13Chan D.C. Kim P.S. Cell. 1998; 93: 681-684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1119) Google Scholar, 14Skehel J.J. Wiley D.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 531-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (2226) Google Scholar). It is, however, still controversial whether the SNARE complex is actively involved in fusion (1Lin R.C. Scheller R.H. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 19-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar) or whether it plays a mere catalytic role (15Schoch S. Deák F. Königstorfer A. Mozhayeva M. Sara Y. Südhof T.C. Kavalali E.T. Science. 2001; 294: 1117-1122Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar) or a different role (16Ungermann C. Sato K. Wickner W. Nature. 1998; 396: 543-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, slow but measurable membrane fusion has been observed for cell-free SNARE-reconstituted vesicles (17Weber T. Zemelman B.V. McNew J.A. Westermann B. Gmachl M. Parlati F. Sollner T.H. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1998; 92: 759-772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2015) Google Scholar, 18McNew J.A.

On the other hand, the structure of the t-SNARE complex would provide valuable insights into the SNARE assembly process. Recently, the crude alignment of the SNARE regions in the t-SNARE complex has been determined using spin labeling EPR (19Xiao W.Z. Poirier M.A. Bennett M.K. Shin Y.K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 308-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 20Margittai M. Fasshauer D. Pabst S. Jahn R. Langen R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13169-13177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The t-SNARE complex appears to be structurally similar to the ternary complex; syntaxin 1A and SNAP-25 assemble into a parallel four-helix bundle that consists of two copies of the syntaxin 1A H3 domain and the two helical domains of SNAP-25. The data from the EPR study, however, were not sufficient to tell whether the t-SNARE complex actually forms a coiled-coil structure. Furthermore, this study indicated that the middle section of the four-helix bundle is perhaps disordered (19Xiao W.Z. Poirier M.A. Bennett M.K. Shin Y.K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 308-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). It is also suggested that the C-terminal region of the t-SNARE complex is partially uncoiled when compared with the structure of the ternary SNARE complex (20Margittai M. Fasshauer D. Pabst S. Jahn R. Langen R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13169-13177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Thus, more data are required to establish its structural relationship to the ternary SNARE complex. Functionally, homotypic membrane fusion has been observed in v-SNARE-deleted yeasts (21Nichols B.J. Ungermann C. Pelham H.R. Wickner W.T. Haas A. Nature. 1997; 387: 199-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar, 22Marash M. Gerst J.E. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 411-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), implying that the t-SNARE complex can mediate membrane fusion. It is also shown that t-SNARE proteins are sufficient for the fusion of ER membranes (23Patel S.K. Indig F.E. Olivieri N. Levine N.D. Latterich M. Cell. 1998; 92: 611-620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Thus, the structure of the t-SNARE complex might provide some important clues to the t-SNARE induced membrane fusion. In this study, we investigated the structure of the neuronal t-SNARE complex using site-directed spin labeling (24Hubbell W.L. Gross A. Langen R. Lietzow M.A. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 649-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar, 25Altenbach C. Cafiso D.S. Hubbell W.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 735-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar) and EPR spectroscopy. In particular, we have used the nitroxide scanning strategy in the middle section and the C-terminal region of the core complex. Because there are two copies of syntaxin 1A in the complex, single spin labeling on syntaxin 1A renders two nitroxide spin labels, and the distance between the pairs can be determined (26Rabenstein M.R. Shin Y.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8239-8243Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar, 27Hustedt E.J. Beth A.H. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1999; 28: 129-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). From EPR studies we found that the middle section of the t-SNARE bundle is a coiled coil that is identical to that of the ternary complex. We also found that the C-terminal end of the coiled coil matches with that of the ternary SNARE complex (6Sutton R.B. Fasshauer D. Jahn R. Brünger A.T. Nature. 1998; 395: 347-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (1916) Google Scholar), contradicting to the assertion that the C-terminal region of the t-SNARE complex is uncoiled (20Margittai M. Fasshauer D. Pabst S. Jahn R. Langen R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13169-13177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Our results establish the close structural resemblance between the t-SNARE complex and the ternary SNARE complex. Recombinant glutathione S-transferase (GST) or His6 fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli from the pGEX-KG vector (28Guan K. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 192: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1640) Google Scholar) or pQE-30 vector (Qiagen), respectively. Plasmids encoding GST-syntaxin 1A (amino acids 191–266), GST-SNAP-25 (amino acids 1–206), His6-SNAP-25[N], and GST-SNAP-25[C] were gifts from Dr. Michelle Poirier. The four native cysteines in the SNAP-25 loop were changed to alanines. All cysteine mutants were generated by QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), and they were confirmed by DNA sequencing (Iowa State University DNA Sequencing Facility). GST fusion proteins were expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) Codon Plus RIL (Stratagene) and purified using glutathione-agarose chromatography. The cells were grown at 37 °C in LB with 2 g/liter glucose, 100 μg/ml ampicillin, and 50 μg/ml chloramphenicol untilA 600 reached 0.6–0.8. After adding isopropylthio-β-d-galactopyranoside (0.3 mm) the cells were further grown for 6 more h at 30 °C for GST-SNAP-25, and GST-SNAP-25[C] but at 16 °C for GST-syntaxin 1A. The cysteine mutants were spin labeled, while the protein was bound to the beads. The beads were first treated with 2 mmdithiothreitol. After washing with an excess volume of PBST (phosphate-buffered saline with Tween 20 (0.5%))-Met buffer a 10-fold molar excess of MTSL was added, and the sample was reacted with MTSL for 4 h at the room temperature. After this the sample was left to stand at 4 °C overnight. Free MTSL was removed by washing PBST-Met buffer, and the spin-labeled protein was cleaved off from the resin with thrombin. Spin labeling was nearly quantitative for all cysteine mutants. His6-SNAP-25[N] was expressed in E. colistrain M15[pREP4] and purified using Ni-NTA affinity chromatography. The cells were grown at 37 °C in LB with 2 g/liter glucose, 100 μg/ml ampicillin, and 25 μg/ml kanamycin untilA 600 reached 0.6–0.8. Protein expression was induced by isopropylthio-β-d-galactopyranoside (1 mm), and the cells were grown for 6 h at 30 °C. The protein was bound to the Ni-NTA resin and washed with buffer A (50 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mmNaCl, and 20 mm imidazole, pH 8.0). To prepare the t-SNARE complex purified syntaxin 1A and SNAP-25[C] were added to the Ni-NTA resin solution that was bound to His6-SNAP-25[N] with the molar ratio of 2:1:1, and the solution was incubated at 4 °C overnight. After washing with buffer A, the t-SNARE complex was eluted from the Ni-NTA resin with elution buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, 250 mm imidazole, pH 8.0). Protein samples were concentrated using centricons with a 5000 molecular weight cutoff (Millipore, Bedford, MA) to perform EPR spectroscopy. The protein concentrations were approximately in the range of 50–100 μm. Purified syntaxin 1A and SNAP-25 were mixed with a molar ratio of 2:1, and the mixture was left to stand at 4 °C overnight. The complex was then purified with Bio-Rad UNO Q1 perfusion column, equipped in the Bio-Rad Duoflo system, in 15 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.4, buffer using a NaCl gradient from 15 mm to 0.5m. All protein concentrations were estimated by Bio-Rad protein assay using bovine serum albumin as a standard. EPR spectra were obtained using a Bruker ESP 300 spectrometer (Bruker, Germany) equipped with a low noise microwave amplifier (Miteq, Hauppauge, NY) and a loop-gap resonator (Medical Advances, Milwaukee, WI). The modulation amplitude was set at no greater than one-fourth of the line width. Spectra were collected at either room temperature or 130 K in first-derivative mode. At room temperature the microwave power was kept at 1 milliwatt, but it was 8 microwatts at 130 K to avoid the saturation of EPR lines. All protein samples contain 10–15% glycerol as a cryoprotectant. Since the previous EPR study (19Xiao W.Z. Poirier M.A. Bennett M.K. Shin Y.K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 308-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) indicated that the middle section of the neuronal t-SNARE complex might be uncoiled or disordered, our investigation was focused on the structural determination of the region neighboring the evolutionally conserved Gln-226 in syntaxin 1A (Fig.1). The nitroxide scanning strategy (29Altenbach C. Marti T. Khorana H.G. Hubbell W.L. Science. 1990; 248: 1088-1092Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar,30Mchaourab H.S. Perozo E. Eaton G.R. Eaton S.S. Berliner L.J. Biological Magnetic Resonance. 19. Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishing Corp., New York2000: 185-238Google Scholar) should be an effective way to examine the secondary and the tertiary structure of the region. We have generated 10 consecutive single cysteine mutants of syntaxin 1A in the region of amino acids 221–230 for spin labeling (Fig. 1 a). The cysteine mutants were reacted with thiol specific MTSL for EPR measurements. In this experiment we have chosen to use SNAP-25[N] and SNAP-25[C] for the complex formation. Thus, the complex does not contain the SNAP-25 loop. For individual mutants we analyzed the SNARE complex formation using gel electrophoresis under non-denaturing conditions and SDS-PAGE (data not shown). We found that all spin-labeled syntaxin 1A mutants were capable of forming the binary t-SNARE complex (data not shown). Because the t-SNARE complex contains two copies of syntaxin 1A, this naturally leads to two nitroxides per complex for singly labeled syntaxin 1A. When two nitroxides are located close to one another, the interaction between them leads to the broadening of the EPR spectrum. The spin-spin interaction is a function of the distance, and the spectral broadening can be analyzed to determine the inter-spin distance (26Rabenstein M.R. Shin Y.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8239-8243Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar, 31Hustedt E.J. Beth A.H. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 1861-1877Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 32Altenbach C., Oh, K.J. Trabanino R.J. Hideg K. Hubbell W.L. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 15471-15482Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Here, we wish to test whether the central region of the four-helix bundle is indeed disordered or it otherwise maintains the parallel coiled-coil structure by examining distances as well as spectral broadening. Coiled coils are featured by the repeats of the seven residues denoted by symbols a through g (Fig. 1, a andb). Among those a and d are typically the non-polar residues that constitute the core, whereas the others are peripheral positions of the intertwined helix bundle. Sequence analysis predicts a high coiled-coil propensity for syntaxin 1A, and the theoretically predicted a-to-g repeat is shown below the amino acid sequence in Fig. 1 a. We also show a schematic helical wheel model representing a predicted arrangement of two syntaxins in the parallel four-helical bundle in Fig.1 b. In this model the a position from one syntaxin makes the contact with the d position from the second syntaxin as it should be for a parallel coiled coil. To be consistent with the model (Fig. 1 b), a strong spin-spin interaction and extensive spectral broadening are expected for residues 223, 226, and 230, which are a, d, and a positions, respectively. On the other hand, we should expect much weaker spin-spin interaction and therefore less spectral broadening for other peripheral positions. First derivative-mode EPR spectra collected at room temperature for all ten positions are plotted in Fig. 2. Spectra for positions 223, 226, and 230 exhibit significant spectral broadening characteristic of the strong spin-spin interaction, partially satisfying the requirements for the coiled-coil structure. With the room temperature EPR spectra, however, the weak spin-spin interactions that might be occurring for the other seven positions are not obvious due to the coexistence of motional broadening effects. The spectral broadening caused exclusively by the spin-spin interaction is better represented in the EPR spectra taken at low temperature where the side chain motion is completely frozen. For the same spin-labeled samples EPR spectra taken at 130 K are also shown in Fig. 2. EPR spectra here are plotted in the absorbance mode. Spectral broadening is conspicuous for positions 223, 226, and 230, as it was at the room temperature. In contrast, for seven other positions, we observe some, but much less, EPR line broadening, indicating the weaker spin-spin interaction and the longer distances between spin pairs. Thus, the EPR data are in a good qualitative agreement with the coiled-coil model in Fig. 1 b. To examine the structure of two syntaxin helices quantitatively, the low temperature EPR spectra were analyzed to determine the interspin distances. We used the Fourier deconvolution analysis (26Rabenstein M.R. Shin Y.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8239-8243Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar) that has proven to be effective in the range of 7–25 Å (33Liu Y.S. Sompornpisut P. Perozo E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 883-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 34Thorgeirsson T.E. Xiao W.Z. Brown L.S. Needleman R. Lanyi J.K. Shin Y.K. J. Mol.

The Fourier analysis revealed that the distances for 223, 226, and 230 are 9, 11, and 10 Å, respectively, while the distances for other spin pairs range from 15 to 22 Å. In Fig. 3 A EPR-determined distances were compared with two sets of model distances. The first distance set (open circles) is obtained from the corresponding β carbon-to-β carbon distances in the crystal of the ternary complex (7Poirier M.A. Hao J.C. Malkus P.N. Chan C. Moore M.F. King D.S. Bennett M.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11370-11377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). For this we assumed that the second copy of syntaxin 1A substituted the VAMP2 helix without any structural rearrangement. The second data set (open squares) is obtained from a simple helical wheel model that retains the parallel four-helix bundle geometry, but the extension of the nitroxide side chains is taken into consideration (Fig. 3 B). The diameter of the helix near the “0” layer is ∼7 Å (7Poirier M.A. Hao J.C. Malkus P.N. Chan C. Moore M.F. King D.S. Bennett M.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11370-11377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The tip of the nitroxide is six ς-bonds away from the β carbon, and it is shown that the nitroxide is located ∼7 Å away from the center of the helices (26Rabenstein M.R. Shin Y.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8239-8243Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar, 37Russell C.J. Thorgeirsson T.E. Shin Y.K. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 337-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). A simple model best representing these conditions are depicted in Fig. 3 B. In Fig. 3 A it is shown that EPR-determined distances are in excellent agreement with those from a simple structural model (Fig.3 B). This suggests that the structure of the t-SNARE complex in the middle is virtually indistinguishable from the crystal structure of the core SNARE complex within experimental uncertainty. The uncertainty of the EPR measurement mainly stems from the side chain degree of freedom. It is estimated to be 2–3 Å for a pair of fully exposed nitroxide side chains (38Fiori W.R. Millhauser G.L. Biopolymers. 1995; 37: 243-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Tertiary confinements may increase the uncertainty depending on the circumstances. Since a previous study suggested that the t-SNARE complex is frayed at the C terminus (20Margittai M. Fasshauer D. Pabst S. Jahn R. Langen R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13169-13177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), we next directed our investigation to find where the coiled-coil structure ends at the C terminus. We have generated 10 consecutive cysteine mutants for nitroxide scanning experiments in this region (Fig. 1 a). For this experiment we have used the SNAP-25 construct containing the long loop. All spin-labeled syntaxin 1A mutants were capable of forming the binary t-SNARE complex, as confirmed by gel electrophoresis under non-denaturing conditions and SDS-PAGE (data not shown). EPR spectra of the ten spin-labeled mutants collected at room temperature are plotted in Fig. 4. The tendency of spectral narrowing along the sequence is clearly seen. This indicates that the polypeptide chain becomes progressively more mobile toward the C-terminal end. However, it appears that the first four spectra (256 through 259) are significantly different from the next six (260 through 265), and their spectral line widths are much broader than that of the rest. Residue 258 exhibits the broadest EPR spectra, indicating some extensive tertiary contact (39Mchaourab H.S. Lietzow M.A. Hideg K. Hubbell W.L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7692-7704Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). We note that residue 258 is predicted to be at the a position in the coiled coil. Thus, it is most likely that the coiled coil structure is retained up to residue 259. We determined the interspin distance for individual spin labeled mutants using the Fourier deconvolution method. Although position 258 is predicted to be the a position, the distance is 19 Å, much longer than what is expected for the coiled coil. Instead, we observe a shorter 14 Å for position 257, shorter than what is expected for the g position. Such anomaly perhaps indicates some structural distortion at the end of the coiled coil. Distances for all other positions are over 20 Å, consistent with the divergent C-terminal region (data not shown). Our EPR results strongly suggest that two copies of syntaxin 1A in the t-SNARE complex intertwine as a coiled coil in the middle section around Gln-226, and the coiled coil most likely extends to residue 259. In the four-helix bundle of the ternary SNARE complex residue Gln-226 of syntaxin 1A makes the ionic 0 layer, together with residue Arg-56 of VAMP2, and residues Gln-53 and Gln-175 from the N- and the C-terminal “SNARE regions” of SNAP25, respectively. Therefore, in the t-SNARE complex Gln-226′ from the second copy of syntaxin 1A likely occupies the spot for VAMP2 Arg-56 in the ternary complex. We speculate that four glutamine residues at the 0 layer significantly destabilize the four-stranded coiled-coil structure (40Scales S.J. Yoo B.Y. Scheller R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14262-14267Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 41Ossig R. Schmitt H.D. de Groot B. Riedel D. Keranen S. Ronne H. Grubmuller H. Jahn R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6000-6010Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Yet, we found from our EPR study that this region assembles into a well defined coiled coil in the t-SNARE complex. A previous EPR study suggested some structural disorder around the 0 layer, although the t-SNARE complex forms a four-stranded coiled coil in the C- and N-terminal regions (19Xiao W.Z. Poirier M.A. Bennett M.K. Shin Y.K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 308-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The explanation for the discrepancy between the previous work and the conclusions from this work could be due to the presence of the mixed complexes. Recently, it has been shown that the t-SNARE complex is actually a mixture of two different kinds: (i) the complex composed of two copies of syntaxins, and N- and C-terminal SNARE regions of SNAP-25, and (ii) the complex composed of two copies of syntaxins and two identical copies of the N-terminal SNARE region of SNAP-25 (42Misura K.M. Gonzalez L.C. Jr. May A.P. Scheller R.H. Weis W.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41301-41309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In the previous EPR work, the nitroxide pairs were mostly attached to SNAP-25. Thus, coexistence of two types of t-SNARE complexes could have resulted in the spin distances that are (i) neither representing those in the complex nor (ii) corresponding to those in the complex, severely impairing the structural interpretation. Present EPR work suggests that the four-stranded coiled-coil structure of the t-SNARE complex extends to residue 259 of syntaxin 1A. According to the crystal structure the syntaxin in the ternary complex is also helical up to residue 259. However, an EPR study has shown a dramatic increase of the motional rate at positions 258 and 259 in the t-SNARE complex when compared with those in the ternary complex (20Margittai M. Fasshauer D. Pabst S. Jahn R. Langen R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13169-13177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). This result was interpreted as the evidence for the frayed C-terminal region of the four-helix bundle. We argue that this conclusion may not properly represent the structure of the relevant SNARE complex. The discrepancy between the EPR study and our present work could be attributed to the differences in the length of the polypeptide chains; in our study residues up to 266 are included, while a four-residue shorter polypeptide was used in the other EPR study. The extra four residues could have contributed to the stability of the helical structure at the C-terminal end. The H3 domain of syntaxin 1A spontaneously assembles into an anti-parallel arrangement of two parallel dimers (42Misura K.M. Gonzalez L.C. Jr. May A.P. Scheller R.H. Weis W.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41301-41309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). It is conceivable that the two copies of syntaxins in the binary complex are structurally similar to the parallel helices in the syntaxin ologomer. As mentioned above syntaxin is helical up to residue 259 in the t-SNARE complex. In contrast, the last ordered residue in the crystal structure of the syntaxin ologomer is residue 253. The interaction between syntaxins and SNAP-25 helices in the t-SNARE complex perhaps contributes to the further extension of the helical structure rather than that in the syntaxin oligomer. Spin labeling at Q226C results in the replacement of two glutamine residues by the nitroxde side chain in the t-SNARE complex, perhaps severely hampering the stability around the 0 layer. Surprisingly, we observe that the four-helix bundle is still intact as evidenced by the strong spin-spin interaction (Fig. 2), although we detected some motion in the EPR spectrum, indicating local destabilization. Membrane apposition, water exclusion, and rearrangement of lipids at the fusion site are a few early steps toward the membrane fusion (43Chernomordik L.V. Leikina E. Kozlov M.M. Frolov V.A. Zimmerberg J. Mol. Membr. Biol. 1999; 16: 33-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). These are likely to be energetically costly processes. The current fusion model, at least for viral-cellular membrane fusion, postulates that the requisite energy is derived from the conformational change of the fusion proteins (13Chan D.C. Kim P.S. Cell. 1998; 93: 681-684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1119) Google Scholar, 14Skehel J.J. Wiley D.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 531-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (2226) Google Scholar). It has been speculated that the formation of the ternary complex in the case of SNARE-induced fusion may do the similar function. If so, the assembly of the t-SNAREs with v-SNARE would bring about the juxtaposition of two membranes, and the energy released from the assembly process is perhaps directly funneled to the fusion site for the water exclusion and the rearrangement of the lipid. Likewise, although highly speculative, the four-stranded coiled-coil structure of the t-SNARE complex demonstrates its capability as a potential fusogen. The t-SNARE four-stranded coiled coil could play an active role in membrane fusion in v-SNARE-deleted fusion models, although other explanations are possible for membrane fusion in those fusion models. It appears that the neuronal t-SNARE complex is structurally different from the yeast t-SNARE complex. An NMR investigation (44Fiebig K.M. Rice L.M. Pollock E. Brünger A.T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 117-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar) revealed that the yeast t-SNARE complex is a 1:1 complex of Sso1 (homologous to syntaxin) and Sec9 (homologous to SNAP-25) for which the C-terminal domain of syntaxin below residue 245 is largely unstructured. Intriguingly, it is recently shown that the yeast t-SNAREs likely form the 2:1 complex in vivo (22Marash M. Gerst J.E. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 411-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), warranting further investigation. For residue 258, that is predicted to be an a position, we observed a broad slow motional EPR spectrum characteristic of an internal position in the coiled coil. However, we do not observe the strong spin-spin interaction, as it has been the case for the nitroxides attached to the midsection. Instead, we detected a relatively strong spin-spin interaction for position 257. This might indicate that the coiled coil is somewhat distorted near the end so that position 257 moves more toward the core region and to be closer to the nitroxide from the second copy of syntaxin 1A."

In normal cells, nuclear β-catenin levels are controlled by the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) protein through nuclear export and cytoplasmic degradation. Transient expression of LEF-1 is known to increase nuclear β-catenin levels by an unknown mechanism. Here, we show that APC and LEF-1 compete for nuclear β-catenin with opposing consequences. APC can export nuclear β-catenin to the cytoplasm for degradation. In contrast, LEF-1 anchors β-catenin in the nucleus by blocking APC-mediated nuclear export. LEF-1 also prevented the APC/CRM1-independent nuclear export of β-catenin as revealed byin vitro assays. Importantly, LEF-1-bound β-catenin was protected from degradation by APC and axin in SW480 colon cancer cells. The ability of LEF-1 to trap β-catenin in the nucleus was down-regulated by histone deacetylase 1, and this correlated with a decrease in LEF1 transcription activity.

The oncogenic potential of β-catenin is mediated by its association with a class of related (but not identical) transcription factors that include lymphoid enhancer factor-1 (LEF-1),1 and the T cell factors including TCF-1, -3, and -4 (3Polakis P.

Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1837-1851Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, we and others showed that the nuclear build-up of β-catenin is normally prevented by a combination of nuclear export and cytoplasmic degradation (12Henderson B.R. Nat.

Despite the ability of β-catenin to efficiently exit the nucleus of SW480 colon cancer cells (16Eleftheriou A. Yoshida M. Henderson B.R. J. Biol.

Despite the many nuclear proteins with which β-catenin associates (18Sharpe C. Lawrence N. Martinez Arias A. Bioessays. 2001; 23: 311-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), β-catenin nuclear retention is most often correlated with binding to LEF-1 (4Behrens J. von Kries J.P. Kuhl M. Bruhn L.

Some reports suggest that LEF-1 can compete directly with APC and with E-cadherin for the mutually exclusive binding to the armadillo repeat domain of β-cateninin vitro (23Orsulic S. Huber O. Aberle H. Arnold S. Kemler R. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1237-1245Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or in vivo (20Simcha I. Shtutman M. Salomon D. Zhurinsky J. Sadot E. Geiger B. Ben-Ze'ev A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1433-1448Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 23Orsulic S. Huber O. Aberle H. Arnold S. Kemler R. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1237-1245Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, Neufeld et al. (13Neufeld K.L. Zhang F. Cullen B. White R.L. EMBO Rep. 2000; 1: 519-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) proposed that APC binding is dominant and that APC can displace nuclear β-catenin from LEF-1 complexes and subsequently export β-catenin to the cytoplasm. Given the well documented role of β-catenin-LEF-1 transcription complex activity in cell signaling and cancer (1Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Cell. 1996; 87: 159-170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4286) Google Scholar, 2Morin P.J. Bioessays. 1999; 21: 1021-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar, 3Polakis P. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1837-1851Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we have investigated the mechanism by which LEF-1 acts to retain β-catenin in the nucleus. We confirmed that LEF-1 and APC do compete for nuclear β-catenin; however, APC did not remove β-catenin once it was bound to LEF-1. In fact, LEF-1 effectively blocked APC-mediated nuclear export of β-catenin in vivo and blocked APC-independent export of β-catenin in vitro. Unexpectedly, LEF-1-bound β-catenin was highly protected in the nucleus from destruction by overexpressed APC and axin. We conclude that the β-catenin-LEF-1 interaction is not one-sided and that while β-catenin can activate transcriptionally silent LEF-1, and LEF-1 in turn functions to trap and stabilize β-catenin in the nucleus. NIH 3T3 mouse fibroblasts and SW480 colon carcinoma cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum and were confirmed free of mycoplasma. Leptomycin B was added to a final concentration of 6 ng/ml. MG132 (Calbiochem) was used at a final concentration of 20 μm. DNA transfection of cells (typically 1 μg of DNA/2 ml of medium) was performed with LipofectAMINE reagent as directed (Invitrogen), using cells at medium density seeded onto coverslips. The pAPC-YFP fusion vector is based on the pCMV-APC vector (25Smith K.J. Levy D.B. Maupin P. Pollard T.D. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 3672-3675PubMed Google Scholar) and contains yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) positioned at the C terminus of APC. We previously found that YFP was not properly expressed when inserted at the N terminus of APC, presumably due to folding constraints (data not shown). To construct pAPC-YFP, the pCMV-APC plasmid was first cut with AvrII at a unique C-terminal restriction site, and a modified PCR-amplified C-terminal fragment was then inserted to create the vector pCMV-APC(MCS). This plasmid was checked by DNA sequencing. The PCR primers used to amplify the APC C terminus were as follows: forward primer (FWDAVR, 5′-TTAATTACAACCCAAG-3′) and reverse primer (REVNOT1, 5′-CCAGTTCCTAGGTTATATCGATGCGGCCGCAACAGATGTCACAAGG-3′). The modified APC C terminus was engineered to incorporate the unique restriction sites NotI and ClaI just prior to the translation stop site, enabling the in-frame insertion of aNotI fragment containing the YFP cDNA. The resulting vector, pAPC-YFP, was confirmed by restriction mapping, and expression of both the APC and YFP domains was confirmed in transfected cells by immunostaining with the APC antibodies Ab7 (recognizes the N terminus, Oncogene Research) and C-20 (recognizes the C terminus, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). SW480 or NIH 3T3 cells were transfected with 0.5 μg of the luciferase reporter plasmids pGL3-OT or pGL3-OF (provided by Dr. B. Vogelstein), in addition to 0.5 μg of various APC plasmid DNAs, or 0.5/2.5 μg of histone deacetylase 1 cDNA (pcDNA3-HDAC1; kind gift of Dr. D. Ayer). The pGL3-OT promoter comprises three LEF-1/TCF binding sites, whereas pGL3-OF contains mutated inactive TCF sites and is a negative control (11He T.C. Sparks A.B. Rago C. Hermeking H. Zawel L. da Costa L.T. Morin P.J. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Science. 1998; 281: 1509-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (4092) Google Scholar). Reporter gene activity was determined 48 h post-transfection with the luciferase assay system (Promega). Luciferase activity of APC-transfected samples was normalized for transfection efficiency by scoring for APC-positive SW480 cells in duplicate samples (immunostained with APC Ab7, Oncogene Research). Final luciferase activity values were arrived at by subtracting background (including the pGL3-OF value) and determining the mean ± S.D. from three experiments (in duplicate), where the pGL3-OT sample was set to 100%. Nuclear export of endogenous cellular β-catenin in SW480 cells was assessed using the digitonin permeabilized cell assay, as recently described in detail (16Eleftheriou A. Yoshida M. Henderson B.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25883-25888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Export reactions were performed at 30 °C for 30 min in transport buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm magnesium acetate, 2 mm EGTA, 50 mm potassium acetate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 50 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm benzamidine, and 50 μg/ml leupeptin in the presence or absence of digitonin (50 μg/ml). All reactions included an energy-regenerating system comprising 1 mm ATP, 0.5 mm GTP, 4 units/ml of creatine kinase, and 10 mm creatine phosphate. Cells were immediately fixed and processed for immunostaining following the export reactions. Cells were grown on glass coverslips, fixed in 3% formalin/PBS for 20 min, followed by permeabilization with 0.2% Triton X-100/PBS for 10 min. Cells were preblocked in 3% bovine serum albumin/PBS for 30 min, incubated 50 min with primary antibody (diluted 1:70 in blocking solution), and washed three times with PBS. Primary antibodies used were as follows: β-catenin (monoclonal antibody C19220 from Transduction Laboratories and rabbit polyclonal antibody H-102 from Santa Cruz Biotechnology), FLAG-axin (anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody M2 from Sigma), HA-LEF-1 (rabbit polyclonal HA-probe Y-11 from Santa Cruz), and APC (monoclonal antibody Ab7 from Oncogene Research). Cells were then incubated with a secondary antibody (1:120 dilution of a fluorescein isothiocyanate- or Texas Red-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse antibody from Sigma) prior to mounting on slides with Vectashield (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) and fluorescence microscopy. Processing was at room temperature. Cells were analyzed and scored on an Olympus fluorescence microscope at ×400 magnification, and digital images were captured using an OptiScan confocal microscope at ×600 magnification. Quantification of fluorescence images was performed using the NIH Image software as described previously (12Henderson B.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 653-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). Cell fractionation and Western blot analysis were performed for transfected SW480 cells as described previously (24Galea M.A. Eleftheriou A. Henderson B.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45833-45839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In mouse NIH 3T3 fibroblasts, cellular β-catenin is localized mainly at the plasma membrane (Fig.1 A). Prior to testing for regulation by LEF-1, we first confirmed that endogenous β-catenin is regulated by nuclear export and degradation in NIH 3T3 cells, by comparing the effects of drugs that block CRM1-specific nuclear export (leptomycin B, LMB) and proteasome-dependent degradation (MG132). We observed that a 16-h treatment with MG132 induced a stronger induction (9-fold) of nuclear β-catenin than did leptomycin B (4-fold), following immunostaining and confocal scanning microscopy (see images and fluorescence quantification in Fig.1 A). Thus, β-catenin accumulates in the nucleus of 3T3 cells following inhibition of the major nuclear export and degradation pathways. Previous studies reported an increase in nuclear β-catenin following the transient overexpression of LEF-1 (4Behrens J. von Kries J.P. Kuhl M. Bruhn L. Wedlich D. Grosschedl R. Birchmeier W. Nature. 1996; 382: 638-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (2605) Google Scholar, 19Huber O. Korn R. McLaughlin J. Ohsugi M. Herrman B.G. Kemler R. Mech. Dev. 1996; 59: 3-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (784) Google Scholar, 20Simcha I. Shtutman M. Salomon D. Zhurinsky J. Sadot E. Geiger B. Ben-Ze'ev A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1433-1448Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). We investigated this further and discovered that endogenous nuclear β-catenin (see confocal images in Fig. 1 B) increased in proportion to the amount of ectopically expressed LEF-1, as revealed by quantitative imaging of β-catenin/LEF-1 nuclear fluorescence and linear regression analysis (Fig. 1 B). LEF-1 had a similar effect on ectopically expressed β-catenin (data not shown), and unlike the previous study of Hsu et al. (21Hsu S.-C. Galceran J. Grosschedl R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4807-4818Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar), the positive effect of LEF-1 was not dependent on co-expression of wnt-1 protein. As a specificity control, overexpression of nuclear p53 had little effect on nuclear β-catenin (data not shown). We next tested whether co-expression of wild-type APC, or mutant APC-(1–1309) that binds but does not degrade β-catenin, caused a reduction in the effect of LEF-1. As shown in Fig. 1 C, both forms of APC did reduce the LEF-1-dependent induction of nuclear β-catenin (although somewhat modestly), suggesting that LEF-1 and APC can compete for nuclear β-catenin in vivo. This finding significantly extends earlier experiments that demonstrated an in vitrocompetition for β-catenin between LEF-1 and subfragments of APC (23Orsulic S. Huber O. Aberle H. Arnold S. Kemler R. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1237-1245Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The overexpression of wild-type APC is known to inhibit β-catenin/LEF-1 transcriptional activity in APCmut/mut SW480 colon cancer cells (17Munemitsu S. Albert I. Souza B. Rubinfeld B. Polakis P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3046-3050Crossref PubMed Scopus (957) Google Scholar). This inhibitory action is likely to involve competition with LEF-1/TCF factors for binding to β-catenin. Interestingly, Neufeld et al. (13Neufeld K.L. Zhang F. Cullen B. White R.L. EMBO Rep. 2000; 1: 519-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) reported that an export-defective form of APC could also disrupt β-catenin transcriptional activity. Our laboratory identified the same two N-terminal nuclear export signals (NESs; Ref. 12Henderson B.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 653-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar) as did Neufeld and colleagues, and using a luciferase reporter assay we also found that APC isoforms containing mutations in NES1, or in both NES1 and NES2, effectively reduced β-catenin/LEF-1 transcription activity (see Fig. 2). Since these full-length APC NES mutants retain the β-catenin degradation sequences, however, we also tested a cancer mutant form of APC-(1–1309) which can bind and export nuclear β-catenin (12Henderson B.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 653-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar), but cannot degrade it (17Munemitsu S. Albert I. Souza B. Rubinfeld B. Polakis P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3046-3050Crossref PubMed Scopus (957) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2, APC-(1–1309) reduced promoter/luciferase activity by ∼50%, and this was unaffected by mutation of NES1, which is the dominant export signal in APC (24Galea M.A. Eleftheriou A. Henderson B.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45833-45839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). These results suggest that the ability of APC to inhibit β-catenin/LEF-1 transcription activity primarily involves nuclear sequestration of β-catenin, but is more efficient when APC retains the ability to export/degrade β-catenin. Can LEF-1 block APC-mediated nuclear export of β-catenin? To address this question without the complication of β-catenin degradation, we again employed the APC-(1–1309) mutant (25Smith K.J. Levy D.B. Maupin P. Pollard T.D. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 3672-3675PubMed Google Scholar). We tested the ability of ectopic APC-(1–1309) to shift β-catenin from nucleus to cytoplasm in transfected SW480 cells, in the absence or presence of co-transfected LEF-1. As shown in the confocal images of Fig.3, transient expression of the mutant APC re-located β-catenin from nucleus to cytoplasm in 73% of transfected cells expressing cytoplasmic APC. However, the co-expression of LEF-1 caused nuclear retention of β-catenin in 85% of APC-transfected cells (see images and graphs in Fig. 3). The co-expression of ectopic APC and LEF-1 was very efficient, with >95% of APC-transfected cells also expressing recombinant LEF-1 (data not shown). The results demonstrate nuclear retention of β-catenin by co-expressed LEF-1 and indicate that APC is incapable of removing β-catenin from LEF-1 nuclear complexes. This contrasts with the recent prediction that APC might displace β-catenin bound to LEF-1 (13Neufeld K.L. Zhang F. Cullen B. White R.L. EMBO Rep. 2000; 1: 519-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Interestingly, LEF-1 did not affect APC localization, confirming that binding to β-catenin by LEF-1 and APC is mutually exclusive in vivo. The striking ability of LEF-1 to block nuclear export of β-catenin by APC-(1–1309) suggested that LEF-1 might also protect β-catenin from degradation by APC. To test this, we first transfected SW480 cells with plasmid encoding full-length untagged APC (pCMV-APC) and observed a total loss of β-catenin in ∼60% of transfected cells (see Fig. 4 A). This was accompanied by an overall 90% reduction in nuclear β-catenin fluorescence in APC-transfected cells (Fig. 4 C). When co-expressed with LEF-1, however, APC no longer exported and promoted degradation of β-catenin. In SW480 cells co-transfected with pHA-LEF-1 and pCMV-APC, nuclear β-catenin fluorescence levels decreased by only 5% in a randomly selected population of transfected cells (Fig. 4 C), although many transfected cells did show a reduction in cytoplasmic β-catenin (see images in Fig.4 A). To confirm these findings, we transiently expressed a full-length APC-YFP fusion vector in SW480 cells and stained these cells with a different β-catenin antibody (monoclonal Ab C19220) to that used above (rabbit polyclonal H-102). As expected, LEF-1 reduced the ability of APC-YFP to export and degrade cellular β-catenin (Fig.4 B). Quantitative imaging revealed that APC-YFP reduced β-catenin nuclear fluorescence by 92% in the absence of LEF-1, but only by 36% in the presence of LEF-1 (Fig. 4 C). Moreover, Western blot analysis of nuclear fractions prepared from SW480 cells untransfected or transfected with APC-YFP ± LEF-1 showed that LEF-1 reduced the disappearance of nuclear β-catenin caused by APC (Fig. 4 D). Collectively, these findings demonstrate for the first time that LEF-1 can inhibit APC-mediated degradation of β-catenin by protecting it in the nuclear compartment. The overexpression of axin, a key component in the cytoplasmic β-catenin degradation complex, is also known to induce β-catenin degradation when overexpressed in cells (26Hart M.J. de los Santos R. Albert I.N. Rubinfeld B. Polakis P. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 573-581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), by a mechanism thought to require the APC/CRM1-independent nuclear export of β-catenin (15Wiechens N. Fagotto F. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 18-27Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar,16Eleftheriou A. Yoshida M. Henderson B.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25883-25888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). As we observed with APC, co-expression of axin with LEF-1 efficiently blocked the axin-dependent degradation of β-catenin in SW480 cells and caused β-catenin sequestration in the nucleus (Fig. 5). We recently showed that endogenous β-catenin can exit the nucleus of semipermeabilized SW480 cells independent of APC and the CRM1 export receptor (16Eleftheriou A. Yoshida M. Henderson B.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25883-25888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In this in vitro assay, cells are treated with the detergent digitonin, which permeabilizes the plasma membrane but leaves the nuclear envelope intact. The export reaction is unidirectional in that β-catenin can exit the nucleus, but is washed away before it re-enters the nucleus (see confocal images in Fig.6 A, top panel). We transfected SW480 cells with LEF-1 and performed the in vitro export reactions in transport buffer containing an energy-regenerating system (see “Materials and Methods”), in the absence or presence of digitonin (Fig. 6 A). Quantitative analysis of confocal images revealed that LEF-1 efficiently retained β-catenin in the nucleus during the in vitro export reaction (Fig. 6, A and B). Therefore, LEF-1 is able to block the general nuclear export of β-catenin. Interestingly, in this assay we also observed the presence of stable β-catenin/LEF-1 in the cytoplasm of some cells. This suggests that LEF-1 is also capable of stabilizing β-catenin in the cytoplasmic compartment, which is consistent with a recent study showing that a related protein, TCF-3, can stabilize β-catenin in the cytoplasm of Xenopusembryo cells (27Lee E. Salic A. Kirschner M.W. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 983-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). We next addressed possible mechanisms by which nuclear LEF-1-β-catenin complexes might be regulated in cells. Recently, histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) was found to interact with LEF-1 or with β-catenin (but apparently not both simultaneously) and caused transcriptional repression of a LEF-1-responsive promoter (28Billin A.N. Thirlwell H. Ayer D.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6882-6890Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). We postulated that HDAC1 might also interfere with the ability of LEF-1 to anchor β-catenin in the nucleus. To test this, we transfected NIH 3T3 cells with pHA-LEF-1 alone, or in the presence of a HDAC1 expression vector, and compared the level of β-catenin nuclear fluorescence in transfected cells (Fig. 7 A). As illustrated by confocal imaging and fluorescence quantification, co-expression of HDAC1 (2:1 ratio of DNA) reduced the LEF-1 induction of nuclear β-catenin by almost 40% (Fig. 7, A andB). Moreover, in the same cell line we confirmed that HDAC1 inhibited LEF-1 activation of a LEF-1 responsive promoter (Fig.7 C). HDAC1 had a similar inhibitory effect in cells co-transfected with both LEF-1 and β-catenin cDNAs (data not shown). We propose that HDAC1 disrupts the LEF-1-β-catenin complex, causing a decrease in nuclear β-catenin, which at least partly contributes to the reduced transcriptional activation of LEF-1-responsive genes. There is strong evidence linking the stabilization of β-catenin with its nuclear accumulation. For instance, nuclear levels of β-catenin are enhanced by its overexpression in transgenic mice (5Harada N. Tamai Y. Ishikawa T.-O. Sauer B. Takaku K. Oshima M. Taketo M.M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5931-5942Crossref PubMed Scopus (981) Google Scholar), by proteasome blockade (Ref. 20Simcha I. Shtutman M. Salomon D. Zhurinsky J. Sadot E. Geiger B. Ben-Ze'ev A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1433-1448Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar and this study; Fig. 1 A), and by mutations in the β-catenin, APC, or axin genes (1Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Cell. 1996; 87: 159-170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4286) Google Scholar, 2Morin P.J. Bioessays. 1999; 21: 1021-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar, 3Polakis P. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1837-1851Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we showed that LEF-1 can trap β-catenin in the nucleus and stabilize it against cytoplasmic destruction by APC-axin complexes, providing an additional mechanism by which cancer cells can elevate β-catenin and its transforming activity within the nucleus. Given that β-catenin can associate with several nuclear proteins including the chromatin remodelling factor BRG1 (29Barker N. Hurlstone A. Musisi H. Miles A. Bienz M. Clevers H. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4935-4943Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar), the histone deacetylase HDAC1 (28Billin A.N. Thirlwell H. Ayer D.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6882-6890Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), and the transcription coactivator p300/CBP (30Sun Y. Kolligs F.T. Hottiger M.O. Mosavin R. Fearon E.R. Nabel G.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12613-12618Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar,31Takemaru K.-I. Moon R.T. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 249-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar), it is likely that additional factors will contribute to its nuclear retention in mammalian cells. Indeed, we observed that co-expression of HDAC1 diminished the ability of LEF-1 to sequester β-catenin in the nucleus and to stimulate transcription of a LEF-1 responsive promoter (Fig. 7). Therefore, the modulation of β-catenin nuclear transport or retention by protein co-factors may reflect a common cellular mechanism for regulating its oncogenic transcription function. This is supported by the finding that the XenopusTCF-3 protein can block nuclear export of β-catenin in microinjectedXenopus oocytes (15Wiechens N. Fagotto F. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 18-27Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The LEF-1 gene is under positive feedback control by β-catenin-LEF-1-TCF transcription complexes (8Hovanes K., Li, T.W.H. Munguia J.E. Truong T. Milovanovic T. Marsh J.L. Holcombe R.F. Waterman M.L.

Res. Commun. 2001; 288: 8-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). LEF-1 forms active complexes with β-catenin in vivo in colon cancer cells (7Porfiri E. Rubinfeld B. Albert I. Hovanes K. Waterman M. Polakis P. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2833-2839Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). We propose that enhanced LEF-1 levels provide an alternative mechanism for stabilizing β-catenin in cells. This may be of particular relevance in cancers where elevated nuclear β-catenin does not correlate with known gene mutations (32Rimm D.L. Caca K., Hu, G. Harrison F.B. Fearon E.R. Am. J. Pathol. 1999; 154: 325-329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 33Omholt K. Platz A. Ringborg U. Hansson J. Int. J. Cancer. 2001; 92: 839-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The ability of LEF-1 to stabilize β-catenin is highly consistent with a positive feedback model that favors accumulation of transcriptionally active and oncogenic β-catenin/LEF-1 complexes. In future experiments it will be of interest to identify additional factors and signaling pathways that modulate the stability/dissociation of LEF-1-β-catenin complexes. The ability to regulate the nuclear activity or nuclear exclusion of β-catenin has implications for potential anticancer therapies. We thank Drs.

Further purification of GRP94 by anion exchange and heparin affinity chromatography yielded resolution of GRP94 from the aminopeptidase activity. Furthermore, exhaustive trypsinolysis of GRP94 preparations displaying aminopeptidase activity yielded complete proteolysis of GRP94 but did not affect aminopeptidase activity.

In addition to its role in the regulation of protein folding and assembly, GRP94 has been demonstrated to elicit a variety of immune system responses. In cancer immunotherapy models, tumor-derived GRP94 can elicit anti-tumor immune responses (5Srivastava P.K. DeLeo A.B. Old L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 3407-3411Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar, 6Udono H. Srivastava P.K. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 5398-5403PubMed Google Scholar, 7Srivastava P.K. Annu. Rev.

This activity is thought to reflect the capacity of GRP94 to function as a peptide-binding protein, with GRP94-peptide complexes being recognized and internalized by antigen-presenting cells (APCs), to yield transfer of GRP94-bound peptides to APC MHC class I molecules for subsequent activation of CD8+ T cells (7Srivastava P.K.

Furthermore, GRP94 has been demonstrated to directly activate APCs to yield NF-κB dependent induction of cytokine secretion, up-regulation of CD80/CD86 and MHC class II expression, and dendritic cell maturation (10Basu S. Binder R.J. Suto R. Anderson K.M. Srivastava P.K. Int. Immunol. 2000; 12: 1539-1546Crossref PubMed Scopus (1083) Google Scholar, 11Singh-Jasuja H. Scherer H.U. Hilf N. Arnold-Schild D. Rammensee H.G.

In addition to a diversity of cellular functions, GRP94 has been reported to display an unusually broad range of intrinsic enzymatic activities. Included in this list are ATP hydrolysis (12Li Z. Srivastava P.K. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3143-3151Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar), although this has been disputed (13Wearsch P.A. Nicchitta C.V. J. Biol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 33313-33318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The latter has been proposed to represent both an autodegrading function and a peptide processing activity that contributes to the generation of peptides suitable for assembly on MHC class I molecules (16Menoret A., Li, Z. Niswonger M. Altmeyer A. Srivastava P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33313-33318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). These enzymatic activities have been identified in highly enriched preparations of GRP94, obtained from a variety of tissue sources. Although thought to represent intrinsic catalytic functions, the reported specific activities, particularly those relating to the kinase and aminopeptidase functions, are quite low. For example, GRP94-associated aminopeptidase activity is reported to be 5 × 106-fold less than that of aminopeptidase M (16Menoret A., Li, Z. Niswonger M. Altmeyer A. Srivastava P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33313-33318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). While investigating the immunological properties of GRP94 purified from tissue culture cells infected with recombinant vaccinia virus (rVV) vectors expressing an ovalbumin peptide epitope (17Berwin B. Reed R.C. Nicchitta C.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21083-21088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), we observed that highly purified GRP94 from this source contained enzymatically significant β-galactosidase activity. The rVV used in this study expresses β-galactosidase on a late promoter, and, thus, the presence of β-galactosidase activity in our preparations reflected enzymologically significant contamination of an (apparently) electrophoretically pure protein. 2R. C. Reed and C. V. Nicchitta, unpublished observations. This led us to consider the challenges of obtaining, and verifying, GRP94 of a purity appropriate for immunological investigations. GRP94, as an Hsp90 family member, is one of the most abundant proteins in the cell. Because of its abundance, relatively low -fold purification is necessary to achieve biochemical levels of purity. For example, when endoplasmic reticulum-derived microsomes are used as the starting tissue source, GRP94 can be purified to apparent homogeneity in two chromatographic steps, yielding a 5–11-fold purification (18Wearsch P.A. Nicchitta C.V. Protein Exp. Purif. 1996; 7: 114-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar).2 Similarly, established procedures for purifying GRP94 from the 100,000 × g supernatant fraction of whole tissue extracts yield electrophoretically pure protein following an ∼20-fold enrichment (19Srivastava P.K. Methods. 1997; 12: 165-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar).2 Although, in each case, purification was achieved through multiple chromatographic steps and the protein appeared homogeneous by common staining methodologies, such analyses do not detect low levels (parts per thousand or less) of contaminating polypeptides. Thus, when the apparent specific activity of an enzyme is low, it is difficult to distinguish between activity intrinsic to the protein and that which is derived from contaminants. In fact, such confusion has been previously chronicled with respect to heparanase, which has been proposed to be highly homologous with, or identical to, GRP94 (20Graham L.D. Biochem. J. 1994; 301: 917-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 21Srivastava P.K. Biochem. J. 1994; 301: 919Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Here, we report evidence that the self-directed kinase and aminopeptidase activities reported for GRP94 are caused by co-purifying proteins, rather than GRP94 itself. Geldanamycin and radicicol were kindly provided by Dr. Len Neckers (National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Rockville, MD). Chlorophenol red-β-d-galactopyranoside (CPRG) was obtained from Roche (Basel, Switzerland). [γ-32P]ATP was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. [32P]Orthophosphate was purchased from Amersham Biosciences. DU-120 is a rabbit polyclonal antibody directed against a domain in the GRP94 NH2terminus and was prepared by contract service with Cocalico Biologicals (Reamstown, PA). All other reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. GRP94 was purified from the livers of C57/B16 mice or from porcine pancreas by either of two methods (18Wearsch P.A. Nicchitta C.V. Protein Exp.

Methods. 1997; 12: 165-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), the following changes were made; all chromatographic steps were performed on an FPLC system (AmershamBiosciences), and K-HEPES-buffered saline was substituted for phosphate-buffered saline during ConA lectin affinity chromatography. Additionally, ResourceQ anion exchange resin (Amersham Biosciences) was substituted for DEAE anion exchange resin and elution was performed with a linear gradient of 50–750 mm NaCl in 10 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.8). The former method (18Wearsch P.A. Nicchitta C.V. Protein Exp.

Methods Enzymol. 1983; 96: 84-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar), and was otherwise identical to that of Wearsch and Nicchitta (18Wearsch P.A. Nicchitta C.V. Protein Exp.

For N[22–337], which represents the amino-terminal domain comprising amino acids 22–337, a 5′ sense primer (5′-GGAATTCCATATGGACGATGAAGTCGATGTG-3′) and a 3′ antisense primer (5′-CGGATCCTCAATTCATAAGCTCCCAATCCCA-3′) were used to obtain a PCR product corresponding to bp 64–1008 of the GRP94 coding region, flanked by 5′ NdeI and 3′ BamHI restriction sites. The PCR product was digested withNdeI/BamHI and ligated into theNdeI/BamHI-digested pGEX vector (gift of Dr. Daniel Gewirth, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC). All protein purifications were performed at 4 °C. Recombinant C[187] protein was expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21 and purified using Ni+-nitrilotriacetic acid beads (Qiagen Sciences, Germantown, MD) in 8 m urea, according to the manufacturer's protocol. After elution, the protein was dialyzed overnight against two 500-fold volume changes of buffer containing 50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 500 mm NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.5 mm β-mercaptoethanol. The protein was subjected to additional purification on a Sephacryl S-200 gel filtration column, in buffer containing 25 mm K-HEPES (pH 7.4), 20 mm NaCl, 110 mm KOAc, 2 mmMg(OAc)2, and 0.1 mm CaCl2. It was then concentrated by centrifugal ultrafiltration and frozen in aliquots. Recombinant N[22–337] was expressed in E. colistrain BL21 and purified using a GSTrap affinity column (AmershamBiosciences) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Removal of glutathione S-transferase was accomplished by thrombin digestion, and further purification was performed using Superdex 75 gel filtration chromatography (Amersham Biosciences). The purified N[22–337] protein was then concentrated by centrifugal ultrafiltration and frozen in aliquots. β-Galactosidase activity was measured using CPRG chromogenic substrate. 200-μl reactions containing 5 μm CPRG, 50 mmpotassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.8), and 1 mmMgCl2 were incubated with samples or dilutions of purified β-galactosidase at 37 °C until color was visible (generally about 20 min) and the A 570 was determined. All β-galactosidase activities were corrected for background substrate hydrolysis (reaction containing no added sample protein). GRP94 kinase activity was assayed in 25-μl reactions containing 50 mm K-HEPES (pH 7.4), 10 mm MgCl2, and 0.15 μm [γ-32P]ATP (2.67 × 106 mCi/mmol). Where indicated, GRP94 was present at 2.4 μg/assay, whereas C[187] was present at 0.75 μg/assay. Incubations were performed at 37 °C for 60 min and stopped by addition of 3 μl of 100% trichloroacetic acid. Following incubation on ice and centrifugation, the pellet was re-suspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE, followed by phosphorimager analysis on a Fuji MacBas100 phosphorimager (Fuji Medical Instruments, Stamford, CT). Quantification was performed using MacBAS version 2.0 software (Fuji Medical Instruments). Aminopeptidase activity was determined by the method of Menoretet al. (16Menoret A., Li, Z. Niswonger M. Altmeyer A. Srivastava P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33313-33318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), using 20 μmalanyl-p-nitroanilide (Ala-pNA) (Sigma) as a substrate. Incubations were performed at 37 °C for 16 h in the dark. All values were corrected for background hydrolysis in samples lacking added protein. Purification of GRP94 from endoplasmic reticulum-derived microsomes was performed by the method of Wearsch and Nicchitta (18Wearsch P.A. Nicchitta C.V. Protein Exp. Purif. 1996; 7: 114-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). All chromatographic fractionations were performed on an FPLC system at 4 °C. For ResourceQ chromatography, a 10-ml ResourceQ column was eluted with a linear 70-ml, 50–750 mm NaCl gradient in 10 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.8). Fractions of 2 ml were collected. For heparin chromatography, a 5-ml heparin HiTrap column (Amersham Biosciences) was eluted using a linear 35-ml, 0–2m NaCl gradient in 20 mm K-HEPES (pH 7.4). Fractions of 0.5 ml were collected. For ConA lectin affinity chromatography, protein was loaded on a 3-ml ConA-agarose column (Sigma) and washed extensively in a column buffer containing 30 mm K-HEPES (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, and 1 mmMgCl2. To elute ConA-bound proteins, 2 ml of elution buffer containing 10% (w/v) α-methylmannoside was added to the column, and the column was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. The column was then eluted with 30 ml of α-methylmannoside-supplemented elution buffer at 4 °C. Two-dimensional isoelectric focusing/SDS-PAGE of porcine GRP94 was performed using the MiniPROTEAN II system (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For in vivo labeling experiments, 2 × 106J558L plasmacytoma cells were incubated for the indicated times at a concentration of 2 × 107 cells/ml in phosphate-free DMEM with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum and 200 μCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate. Samples were pelleted and lysed in a buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.4), 0.05% (w/v) SDS, 1% (w/v) Nonidet P-40, 2 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaF, 100 μmNaVO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.1 mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor for 10 min on ice. GRP94 was immunoprecipitated following pre-clearing with Pansorbin cells (Calbiochem), using 3 μl of DU120 serum and 25 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads per reaction. The beads were washed three times in 190 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.4), 1.25% (v/v) Triton X-100, and 6 mm EDTA and once in phosphate-buffered saline. Beads were re-suspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer and the eluted protein analyzed by SDS-PAGE, followed by phosphorimager quantification. Purification of GRP94 from tissue culture cells infected with rVV expressing bacterial β-galactosidase yields GRP94 containing β-galactosidase activity (data not shown). Because GRP94 certainly lacks intrinsic β-galactosidase activity, and because the two proteins copurify through multiple purification steps, we further examined these results in the context of models for GRP94-enzyme associations that are detectable in electrophoretically homogeneous GRP94 preparations. To trace the fate of β-galactosidase during the purification of GRP94, 150 units (0.2 mg) of purified E. coliβ-galactosidase was added to a pancreatic rough microsome suspension containing 240 mg of total protein, immediately prior to beginning the GRP94 purification protocol. Exogenous β-galactosidase thus represented less than 0.1% of the total protein present, by weight. GRP94 was purified from the microsomes by the method of Wearsch and Nicchitta (18Wearsch P.A. Nicchitta C.V. Protein Exp. Purif. 1996; 7: 114-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar); microsomes were permeabilized to obtain soluble luminal proteins, which were then separated by sequential anion exchange and gel filtration chromatography. This purification yielded electrophoretically pure protein (Fig. 1,lane 1). However, subsequent analysis of this protein indicated enzymologically significant levels of β-galactosidase activity (Table I). In fact, analysis of intermediate fractions from the purification demonstrated a 6-fold enrichment of β-galactosidase during the purification of GRP94. By contrast, GRP94 was enriched 11-fold in this preparation.Table IPurification of GRP94 from β-galactosidase spiked rough microsomesFractionmg of GRP94/mg of total proteinβ-Galactosidase specific activity units/mgRough microsomes0.0880.614Luminal proteins0.1260.724ResourceQ0.8662.43Gel filtration1.01-aBoth of these fractions were electrophoretically homogeneous (see Fig. 1).3.69ConA eluate1.01-aBoth of these fractions were electrophoretically homogeneous (see Fig. 1).0.070150 units (0.2 mg) of β-galactosidase was added to porcine pancreatic rough microsomes (240 mg of protein total) and GRP94 was purified as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Fractions from each step were analyzed for total protein content by BCA protein assay, GRP94 content by SDS-PAGE, Coomassie Blue staining and gel densitometry using MacBAS version 2.0, and β-galactosidase activity by CPRG assay as described under “Experimental Procedures.”1-a Both of these fractions were electrophoretically homogeneous (see Fig. 1). Open table in a new tab 150 units (0.2 mg) of β-galactosidase was added to porcine pancreatic rough microsomes (240 mg of protein total) and GRP94 was purified as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Fractions from each step were analyzed for total protein content by BCA protein assay, GRP94 content by SDS-PAGE, Coomassie Blue staining and gel densitometry using MacBAS version 2.0, and β-galactosidase activity by CPRG assay as described under “Experimental Procedures.” We investigated whether β-galactosidase could be separated from GRP94 by a further purification step. GRP94 bears an N-linked high mannose oligosaccharide and thus binds ConA, whereas β-galactosidase does not. GRP94 from the above purification was applied to a ConA column, washed extensively, and eluted with α-methylmannoside. Following this step, 73% of the recovered GRP94 was found in the ConA-binding fractions (data not shown). This GRP94 fraction was electrophoretically homogeneous (Fig. 1, lane 2). In contrast, the majority of the β-galactosidase activity was recovered in the ConA flow-through. However, 2% of the remaining β-galactosidase activity was eluted upon addition of α-methylmannoside (Table I). Thus, enzymologically discernible quantities of β-galactosidase remained in the GRP94 fraction following three chromatography steps, including a highly selective glycoprotein-affinity elution. In light of the observation that GRP94 co-purified with enzymatically measurable quantities of β-galactosidase, although appearing to be electrophoretically pure, we investigated the possibility that other enzyme activities attributed to GRP94 may also reflect co-purifying or directly associated proteins. Numerous investigators have reported that GRP94 can be phosphorylated; autophosphorylation of GRP94 has been reported (15Csermely P. Miyata Y. Schnaider T. Yahara I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6381-6388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), whereas other reports indicate that it is phosphorylated by casein kinase II (CKII) (23Cala S. Jones L.

Schonthal A.H. Lee A.S. J. Cell. Physiol. 1997; 170: 115-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). To further investigate the GRP94-associated kinase activity, GRP94 was purified from two tissue sources (murine liver and porcine pancreas), using two different methods. In the first, based on the method of Srivastava (19Srivastava P.K. Methods. 1997; 12: 165-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), tissue was homogenized in hypotonic (30 mmsodium bicarbonate) buffer and centrifuged to yield a 100,000 ×g soluble fraction. This fraction was then subjected to ammonium sulfate precipitation and sequential ConA glycoprotein affinity and ResourceQ anion exchange chromatography, to yield the highly enriched GRP94 fraction. The second method was that of Wearsch and Nicchitta (18Wearsch P.A. Nicchitta C.V. Protein Exp. Purif. 1996; 7: 114-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) and began with the generation of rough ER microsomes by the method of Walter and Blobel (22Walter P. Blobel G. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 96: 84-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar) and detergent extraction of these microsomes. The soluble luminal proteins released from the detergent extraction were then fractionated by ResourceQ anion exchange and gel filtration chromatography. The resulting four preparations were assayed for apparent autophosphorylation activity. Following incubation with [γ-32P]ATP, GRP94 phosphorylation was evident in all four protein preparations, although the level of phosphorylation varied by 21-fold between the preparations (Fig.2). We compared this kinase activity to that of purified CKII, for which GRP94 is a substrate in vitro (23Cala S. Jones L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5926-5931Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 2.4 μg of GRP94 purified from a liver whole tissue extract was phosphorylated at a rate equivalent to that predicted for 3.90 milliunits, or 2.3 ng, of CKII. For GRP94 from pancreatic whole cell extract, the rate of phosphorylation was comparable with that of 0.114 milliunits, or 68 pg, of CKII. Thus, if GRP94 were a self-directed kinase, it would have a specific activity 1,040–35,300 times lower than that of CKII. To examine which domain of GRP94 was phosphorylated by the kinase present in the purified GRP94 fractions, phosphorylation assays were performed using recombinant GRP94 fragments encoding either the carboxyl-terminal 187 amino acids of GRP94 (C[187]), or amino acids 22–337 (N[22–337]), which comprises the amino-terminal domain. No phosphorylation was observed in the N[22–337] domain, with or without full-length GRP94 present (Fig.3). The C[187] domain was phosphorylated only in the presence of purified, full-length GRP94, and, when both substrates were available, C[187] was phosphorylated preferentially over full-length GRP94. We conclude that the carboxyl terminus is an in vitro target of the GRP94-associated kinase. We next investigated the substrate specificity of the kinase. In assays combining full-length GRP94 and casein, GRP94 was phosphorylated and casein was not (Fig. 4 A). By contrast, casein was efficiently phosphorylated by picogram quantities of CKII, clearly indicating that the GRP94 kinase is not CKII (Fig.4 A). Similar to the CKII nucleotide substrate specificity, however, phosphorylation of full-length GRP94 could be inhibited by addition of a 100-fold excess of unlabeled ATP or GTP, but was unaffected by the Hsp90 inhibitors geldanamycin and radicicol (data not shown). To examine whether GRP94 associates specifically with the kinase, GRP94 was incubated with a molar excess of a kinase substrate, C[187], or a nonsubstrate, casein. GRP94 was separated from the other proteins by ConA binding and tested in a kinase assay. If the kinase were bound to GRP94, we reasoned that it would release from GRP94 to bind C[187], thus decreasing the GRP94-associated kinase activity. However, although we observed a 50% decrease in kinase activity following ConA binding and elution, no additional decrease in kinase activity was observed upon incubation with excess substrate or nonsubstrate protein (Fig. 4 B). We conclude that the association between GRP94 and the kinase is not disrupted by kinase substrate, although further purification of GRP94 on ConA does decrease the kinase activity. That C[187] was phosphorylated but itself possessed no GRP94 kinase activity provided a strategy for investigating the kinase. Thus, kinase activity, assayed as C[187] phosphorylation, and GRP94, assayed by immunoblot analysis, were examined during the purification process to determine whether they co-purify. Following fractionation of soluble ER luminal proteins on a ResourceQ anion exchange column, GRP94 and kinase activity were recovered in the same fractions (Fig.5 A). However, when the GRP94/kinase peak fractions were pooled and further fractionated over a heparin affinity column, they eluted in different fractions (Fig.5 B). No kinase activity was observed in the fractions containing GRP94. We felt it was important to determine whether GRP94 phosphorylation occurs in vivo, as our observations to this point had been based on in vitro work only, and because it was unclear whether a GRP94 kinase exists in the ER. To address this question, the phosphorylation state of native pancreas-derived GRP94 was examined by two-dimensional isoelectric focusing/SDS-PAGE (Fig.6 A). As depicted in Fig.6 A, GRP94 could be resolved into at least two forms, as distinguished in the isoelectric focusing dimension, consistent with the presence of populations of GRP94 differing by one or more phosphate groups. Further evidence of in vivo GRP94 phosphorylation was provided by labeling tissue culture cells with [32P]ortho-phosphate and subsequently examining the phosphorylation state of GRP94. Resolution of anti-GRP94 immunoprecipitates by SDS-PAGE and phosphorimager analysis revealed a single, prominent radioactive band corresponding to GRP94 (Fig.6 B).

PEP+ADP=ATP+Pyr REACTION1The enzymatic transfer of phosphate from P-enolpyruvate to ATP was first described in 1934 by Parnas, Ostern, and Mann (2Parnas J.K. Ostern P. Mann T. Biochem. Z. 1934; 272: 64-73Google Scholar). Despite early statements of Meyerhof et al. (3Meyerhof O. Ohlmeyer P. Gentner W. Maier-Leibnitz H. Biochem. Z. 1938; 298: 396-406Google Scholar) that the reaction was irreversible, Lardy and Ziegler (4Lardy H.A. Ziegler J. J. Biol. Chem. 1945; 159: 343-351Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar) experimentally showed in rat muscle extracts its reversibility in 1945 from the exchange of32P between P-enolpyruvate and ATP. These workers further showed that P-enolpyruvate could be synthesized directly from pyruvate in a system where ATP was constantly being regenerated and that the rate of reaction increased with increasing potassium concentration (4Lardy H.A.

Can glycolysis be reversed at pyruvate kinase and glycogen form from lactate in skeletal muscle in vivo (7McQuate J.T. Utter M.F. J. Biol.

Chem. 1979; 254: 6548-6553Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)? Because the early thermodynamic study of McQuate and Utter (7McQuate J.T. Utter M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1959; 234: 2151-2157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) indicated an unfavorable equilibrium at the pyruvate kinase step, Krebs proposed a bypass reaction via pyruvate carboxylase (EC 6.4.1.1). Pyruvate carboxylase catalyzes the ATP-driven formation of oxaloacetate from pyruvate and HCO3− and P-enolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) (EC 4.1.1.49), which then converts oxaloacetate to P-enolpyruvate (15Krebs H.A. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1964; 159: 544-564Google Scholar). Although this pathway is known to occur in liver (and kidney) (16Krebs H.A. Woodford M. Biochem. J. 1965; 94: 436-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 17Zammit V.A. Newsholme E.A. Biochem. J. 1978; 174: 979-987Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), it remains unclear whether the enzymes are present in skeletal muscle or heart (18Donovan C.M. Pagliassotti M.J. Med. Sci. Sports Exerc. 2000; 32: 772-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). On closer examination of the otherwise excellent study of McQuate and Utter (7McQuate J.T. Utter M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1959; 234: 2151-2157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), there are a number of unavoidable limitations to their analysis. For example, in the 1950s there was considerable uncertainty about the apparent magnesium and acid binding constants for the ATP and ADP series, the binding of ADP in skeletal muscle, and the problem of measuring accurately low concentrations of metabolites in intact tissue. There was also a lack of computing power to solve the system of simultaneous equations defining the reaction in vitro. These limitations, along with the high sensitivity of the reaction to varying pH and free [Mg2+], have impeded a detailed study into the thermodynamics of the reaction. The aim of this study was to examine the thermodynamics of the pyruvate kinase reaction and estimate the apparent equilibrium position in heart and skeletal muscle using the methodologies described for our earlier work on creatine kinase and arginine kinase (19Teague W.E. Dobson G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14084-14093Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Teague W.E. Dobson G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22459-22463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The present study provides strong evidence that the pyruvate kinase equilibrium may be reversed in vivo, which helps explain otherwise perplexing data on the reversal of glycolysis and glycogen synthesis following exercise. Pyruvate kinase (EC 2.7.1.40) from rabbit skeletal muscle was purchased as the 3.2 m ammonium sulfate suspensions from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Pyruvate-monosodium salt, ATP-crystallized disodium salt, ADP-disodium salt, NADH-monosodium salt (grade 1) and NADP-disodium salt (98%), creatine kinase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, hexokinase from yeast, and lactate dehydrogenase from beef heart were obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Pyruvate kinase (lyophilized powder from rabbit skeletal muscle), P-enolpyruvate-monopotassium salt,d-glucose, imidazole (low fluorescence blank 0.002%) and trizma-base (Tris[hydroxymethyl]-aminomethane), phosphate-potassium salt (monobasic and dibasic), and EDTA (acid form) and hydrogen peroxide 30% (9.8 m) were purchased from Sigma. All other chemicals were reagent grade. The pyruvate kinase reaction was carried out from the forward and reverse direction in a reaction buffer containing 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, 110 mm potassium chloride, and 4.75 mm magnesium chloride at 25 °C. For the forward direction, the reaction buffer also contained 0.5 mm ADP, 0.5 mmP-enolpyruvate, 4.3 mm ATP, and 4.7 mmpyruvate. For the reverse direction the reaction buffer also contained 5.0 mm pyruvate and 5.1 mm ATP. A 10-ml aliquot of each reaction buffer was placed in separate 10-ml conical bottom reaction vials with V-shaped magnetic stirring bars (Pierce). These reaction vials were sealed with removable Teflon caps and placed in a Neslab RTE100 temperature-controlled water bath. Experimental temperature was maintained ± 0.1 °C. A water/air-powered magnetic stir motor was used to mix the reaction vials throughout the experiment. Reaction buffer pH was monitored using a Radiometer Copenhagen PHM 93 reference pH meter, with a Radiometer Copenhagen PHC 2005 electrode. The procedure has been described in detail in Teague and Dobson (19Teague W.E. Dobson G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14084-14093Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Teague W.E. Dobson G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22459-22463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). During the temperature experiments the pH meter was calibrated at each experimental temperature using the Radiometer Copenhagen 47.5 mm phosphate S11M004, pH 7.0 ± 0.01, at 25 °C. This pH standard had a temperature coefficient (ΔpH/Δt °C) of −0.0028, which was appropriate for our reaction buffers that contained 50 mm phosphate. The vials containing the reaction buffer were allowed 20 min to reach temperature prior to initiation of the reaction with enzyme. The pyruvate kinase enzyme was prepared by dissolving 10 mg of the lyophilized powder (5000 units per mg) in 1.0 ml of 50 mm phosphate buffer at pH 7.0, and 10 μl of this preparation was added to the 10 ml of reaction buffer to initiate the reaction (final activity of 5 units/ml at 25 °C). After 1 h of reaction time, a 1.0-ml aliquot was transferred from the reacti-vial to a Centricon-30 spin filter (Amicon) maintained at the experimental temperature in the water bath. The spin filter was then placed into a temperature-controlled rotor and centrifuged at 4000 × g for 5 min. The enzyme-free filtrate (∼300 μl) containing the reaction buffer at equilibrium was removed and kept at −80 °C until analysis the following day. To ensure that the temperature was maintained at a constant throughout the centrifugation, great care was taken to keep the centrifuge and rotors at the appropriate experimental temperature. After completing the first experiment at 5 °C, the bath temperature was raised to 15 °C, and identical procedures were used for equilibration and sampling. The process was then repeated at 25, 35, and 45 °C. Experiments studying the variation of the K′ and pH were carried out in a similar manner at 25 °C. Enzymatic assays of ATP and pyruvate were carried out according to the procedures described in Lowry and Passonneau (40Lowry O.H. Passonneau J.V. A Flexible System of Enzymatic Analysis. Academic Press, New York1972Google Scholar) with the following modifications: ATP was measured spectrophotometrically in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 0.4 mmd-glucose, 1 mmMgCl2, 0.3 mm NADP containing 0.35 units/ml glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. The reaction was initiated with 0.7 units/ml hexokinase and complete in 5 to 10 min. Pyruvate was measured spectrophotometrically in 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.0 (30 mm K2HPO4, 20 mmKH2PO4), and 0.1 mm NADH. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 1.5 units/ml lactate dehydrogenase, and the reaction was complete in 5 to 10 min. P-enolpyruvate or ADP was measured by monitoring NADH fluorescence in the equilibrium samples after pyruvate had been removed by peroxide treatment. Pyruvate removal was essential, because high concentrations interfered with the accurate measurement of the micromolar concentrations of P-enolpyruvate and ADP, a consequence of the overall equilibrium strongly favoring pyruvate and ATP formation. Pyruvate was removed by heating 100 μl of sample in 10 × 75-mm tubes for 10 min at 60 °C in 50 mm imidazole, pH 7.5, and a 5:1 molar excess of H2O2:pyruvate. Control experiments using standards showed that 99–100% of the pyruvate was removed by the peroxide oxidation step, without any effect on P-enolpyruvate or ADP concentrations; there was a 100% recovery of P-enolpyruvate or ADP standards. The excess peroxide was removed by the addition of 25 units/ml catalase (EC 1.11.1.6) to minimize reduction of NADH in subsequent enzymatic measurements but was found not to be necessary in our measurements. P-enolpyruvate or ADP was then measured by adding 1 ml of reagent and the pyruvate kinase-lactate dehydrogenase coupled assay system (21Passonneau J.V. Lowry O.H. Enzymatic Analysis: a Practical Guide. The Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1993Crossref Google Scholar). Briefly, the reagent comprised a 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.0 (30 mmNa2HPO4, 20 mmNaH2PO4), 2 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm ADP, 0.2 mm EDTA, 5 μmNADH, catalase (25 units/ml), and lactate dehydrogenase (50 μl of 10 mg/ml/50 ml). An initial reading was taken, after which 10 μl of pyruvate kinase (5 μl 10 mg/ml of water) was added to the reaction in a volume of 10 μl (1.25 units) to measure the P-enolpyruvate. ADP could be measured by the substitution of 0.2 mmP-enolpyruvate for the ADP in the same reagent. The time for completion of either P-enolpyruvate or ADP measurement was 5 to 10 min. Standard curves were used for quantify the measurements. The acid-dissociation constants and magnesium binding constants for the ATP and ADP series, and for phosphate, and their respective ΔH° values (ionic strength = 0) used in this study can be found in Teague and Dobson (19Teague W.E. Dobson G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14084-14093Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Golding et al. (23Golding E.M. Teague W.E. Dobson G.P. J. Exp. Biol. 1995; 198: 1775-1782Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The acid-dissociation constants were of the form HA = H+ + A− where Ka = [H+] [A−]/[HA], and magnesium binding constants were of the form Mg2+ + Ax = MgA(2 +x) where Kb = [MgA(2 +x)]/[Mg2+][Ax] where HA is the acid, and A is its conjugate base. The method for adjusting the equilibrium constants to 5, 15, 25, 35, and 45 °C at the ionic strength of 0.25 m is also found in these papers. The Ka values using a ΔH° (I = 0) of −4.00 kJmol−1 for P-enolpyruvate were as follows: 5.019 × 10−7 (5 °C), 4.727 × 10−7 (15 °C), 4.4700 × 10−7(25 °C), 4.242 × 10−7 (35 °C), and 4.039 × 10−7 (45 °C) (22Dawson R.M.C. Elliot D.C. Elliot W.H. Jones K.M. Data for Biochemical Research. Clarendon, Oxford1986Google Scholar). The Kb values using a ΔH° (I = 0) of +12.50 kJmol−1 for P-enolpyruvate were as follows: 1.253 × 102(5 °C), 1.511 × 102 (15 °C), 1.800 × 102 (25 °C), 2.120 × 102 (35 °C), and 2.470 × 102 (45 °C) (22Dawson R.M.C. Elliot D.C. Elliot W.H. Jones K.M. Data for Biochemical Research. Clarendon, Oxford1986Google Scholar). Unfortunately we could not find a ΔH° (I = 0) for acid or magnesium binding to pyruvate and have used a Ka of 3.16 × 10−3 (5 to 45 °C) and a Kb of 6.3 (5 to 45 °C) (22Dawson R.M.C. Elliot D.C. Elliot W.H. Jones K.M. Data for Biochemical Research. Clarendon, Oxford1986Google Scholar). The Kb was assumed to be the same as the calcium binding constant. For such weak binding we would not expect a very large ΔH°, 2R. Alberty, personal communication. and thus it would have little impact on our results. Free [Mg2+] refers to the concentration of ionized magnesium as opposed to magnesium bound to compounds such as ATP or other phosphates. Free [Mg2+], and the concentration of major ionic species of reactants of the pyruvate kinase reaction, were calculated using a computer program written in the language ofMathematica® (Wolfram Research). The details of the method and system of equations can be found in Teague and Dobson (19Teague W.E. Dobson G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14084-14093Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Golding et al. (23Golding E.M. Teague W.E. Dobson G.P. J. Exp. Biol. 1995; 198: 1775-1782Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, total concentrations of reactants of the reaction at equilibrium, together with the total magnesium concentration, ionic strength, and the acid-dissociation and metal binding constants adjusted to specified ionic conditions, were substituted into a system of simultaneous equations representing the pyruvate kinase reaction under our experimental conditions. The solution of these simultaneous equations yields molar concentrations for the ionic species of reactants present. To assess the equilibrium position of the biochemical reaction of pyruvate kinase (Reaction 1) in heart and skeletal musclein situ, all the reactants, as well as pH and free [Mg2+], have to be measured or calculated in the tissues. From these data, the mass action ratio can be calculated and compared with the equilibrium constant determined in the laboratory after adjustment to the tissue pH, free [Mg2+] at 38 °C, and ionic strength of 0.25 m. Fourteen male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 300–350 g were obtained from the James Cook University breeding colony and housed in the animal facility. Seven were prepared for heart measurements and seven for muscle measurements. Rats were supplied with unrestricted access to food and water. Animals were anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of sodium pentobarbital (60 mg·kg rat weight−1). The left femoral artery and vein were cannulated with PE 50 tubing, and the venous line was used for maintenance of anesthesia (15 mg·ml−1 solution of sodium pentobarbital in 0.9% saline) whereas the arterial line was for blood collection and continuous monitoring of blood pressure. The details of the procedure are found in Hitchins et al. (24Hitchins S. Cieslar J.M. Dobson G.P. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2001; 281: H882-H887Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, animals were artificially ventilated on room air with a Harvard small animal ventilator (Harvard Apparatus, South Natick, MA) to give a bloodpO2 of ∼90 mm Hg, apCO2 of ∼40 mm Hg, and a pH of ∼7.4. Blood (0.2 ml) was drawn from the arterial line and analyzed with the Ciba-Corning 865 blood gas analyzer (Ciba Corning Diagnostic Corp., Medfield, MA) to ensure that blood gases were within the correct range. For heart measurements a thoracotomy was performed, and a custom-built, flexible arm surface coil (9-mm outer diameter) tunable to31P was placed on the left ventricle. The coil was made of Teflon-coated copper wire (1.25-mm thick) and was sufficiently flexible to follow the movement of the heart and maintain contact, without excessive pressure against the heart (24Hitchins S. Cieslar J.M. Dobson G.P. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2001; 281: H882-H887Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For skeletal muscle measurements, anesthesia was maintained by delivering 1% isoflurane (Abbott Australasia, Kurnell, Australia) in compressed air via the ventilator at a rate of 0.5 liter/min. Like in the heart protocol, the animal was transferred to a purpose-built Perspex cradle. The cradle was pre-fitted with a 37 °C water-heated pad. The gastrocnemius was exposed, and the muscle was carefully denuded of overlying tissue and covered with a plastic film to prevent drying of exposed tissue. A three-turn surface coil (14-mm outer diameter) tunable to31P was placed on the center of the gastrocnemius (25Cieslar J.M. Dobson G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6129-6134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar,26Cieslar J.M. Dobson G.P. Am. J. Physiol. Regul. Int. Comp. Physiol. 2001; 281: R511-R518Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 31P NMR experiments were performed at 121.47 MHz in a 110-mm horizontal bore Oxford 7.05-tesla superconducting magnet coupled to a Varian INOVA NMR spectrometer (24Hitchins S. Cieslar J.M. Dobson G.P. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2001; 281: H882-H887Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For heart, radiofrequency pulses of 8-μs duration at an approximate 40° flip angle were applied with a 1-s interpulse delay. FIDs were acquired over 0.4 s with a total of 1024 free induction delays averaged. An 8000-Hz spectral width was used, and 6400 data points were obtained. A 10-Hz exponential line-broadening factor was applied to 31P NMR spectra, which were fitted using Varian Fitspec software. Following integration, all peaks were multiplied by a saturation correction factor specific for each peak. These factors were determined experimentally by comparing the peak integrals of partially relaxed spectra, obtained using the acquisition parameters described above, to the peak integrals of fully relaxed spectra (20-s interpulse delay). In heart, the mean correction factors for Pi, phosphocreatine, and β-ATP were 0.97 ± 0.08, 1.24 ± 0.04, and 0.87 ± 0.03 (± S.E., n = 7), respectively (24Hitchins S. Cieslar J.M. Dobson G.P. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2001; 281: H882-H887Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Cieslar J.M. Dobson G.P. Am. J. Physiol. Regul. Int. Comp. Physiol. 2001; 281: R511-R518Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Upon completion of spectral acquisition, the heart was freeze-clamped at liquid nitrogen temperature. Tissue was ground to a powder in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C for later enzymatic analysis of tissue ATP concentration and total creatine (24Hitchins S. Cieslar J.M. Dobson G.P. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2001; 281: H882-H887Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Cieslar J.M. Dobson G.P. Am. J. Physiol. Regul. Int. Comp. Physiol. 2001; 281: R511-R518Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For skeletal muscle, radiofrequency pulses of 8-μs duration at an approximate 90° flip angle were applied with a 1-s interpulse delay (24Hitchins S. Cieslar J.M. Dobson G.P. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2001; 281: H882-H887Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Cieslar J.M. Dobson G.P. Am. J. Physiol. Regul. Int. Comp. Physiol. 2001; 281: R511-R518Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). FIDs were acquired over 0.8 s with a total of 256 FIDs averaged. A 6000-Hz spectral width was used, and 9600 data points were obtained. In contrast to heart spectra, a line-fitting program was not required for muscle because of the superior signal to noise ratio. The partially relaxed 31P spectra were calibrated by comparison with fully relaxed spectra using the same process described for heart. In muscle, the mean correction factors for Pi, phosphocreatine, and β-ATP were 0.98 ± 0.10, 1.03 ± 0.01, and 0.88 ± 0.09 (± S.E., n = 6), respectively. Upon completion of spectral acquisition, the muscle was freeze-clamped, and the tissue was powdered in liquid nitrogen for enzymatic determination of ATP, total creatine, pyruvate, and P-enolpyruvate contents. The extraction procedures are described by Hitchins et al. (24Hitchins S. Cieslar J.M. Dobson G.P. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2001; 281: H882-H887Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Free [ADP] was calculated using the creatine kinase equilibria described in detail by Cieslar and Dobson (25Cieslar J.M. Dobson G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6129-6134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 26Cieslar J.M. Dobson G.P. Am. J. Physiol. Regul. Int. Comp. Physiol. 2001; 281: R511-R518Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To convert μmol/g to mm intracellular water the spaces of Cieslar et al. (27Cieslar J. Huang M.-T. Dobson G.P. Am. J. Physiol. Regul. Int. Comp. Physiol. 1998; 275: R1530-R1536Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) for rat heart and skeletal muscle were used. The ATP measured enzymatically was equated with the integral of the β-ATP peak for both heart and muscle spectra taking into account the saturation correction factors. The equations are described in detail in Hitchins et al. (24Hitchins S. Cieslar J.M. Dobson G.P. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2001; 281: H882-H887Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Intracellular pH was calculated from the chemical shift (δ, ppm) of Pi relative to phosphocreatine in the 31P spectra using the NMR version of the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, shown below. pHi=6.75+logδ−3.255.69−δEquation 1 Intracellular free [Mg2+] concentration ([Mg2+]i) was calculated from the observed chemical shift difference (δαβ) in ppm between β-phosphate and α-phosphate resonances of ATP in the31P spectra using the modified form of the London equation (28Golding E.M. Golding R.M. Magn. Reson. Med. 1995; 33: 467-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), shown in Equation 2, [Mg2+]i=KDδαβ(1+α)−(δ1+αδ2)δ3+βδ4−δαβ(1+β)Equation 2 where α = [H+]/KH and β = α(KD/KD′). KH is the dissociation constant for the H/ATP4− equilibrium,KD is the dissociation constant for the ATP4−/Mg2+ equilibrium, andKD′ is the dissociation constant for the ATPH3−/Mg2+ equilibrium. The parameters δ1, δ2, δ3, and δ4 were assigned published values of 10.600, 11.660, 8.165, and 8.52 ppm, respectively, KD was 9.0 × 10−5m, KH was 3.4 × 10−7m, and KD′ was 7.2 × 10−4m (24Hitchins S. Cieslar J.M. Dobson G.P. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2001; 281: H882-H887Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Values are reported as mean ± S.E. Statistical significance was assessed using a student'st test or a two-way repeated measured analysis of variance (ANOVA). The α level of significance for all experiments was set atp < 0.05. Attainment of equilibrium was judged complete when the apparent K′, defined as [ATP][Pyr]/[ADP][P-enolpyruvate] agreed to within 10% when approached from both directions. The initial and final concentrations of reactants, experimental pH, and free [Mg2+] at 25° and the K′experimental(calculated at experimental conditions) and K′ (calculated at specified pH 7, free [Mg2+] 1.0 mm, andI = 0.25 M are shown in TableI. The average K′ in the forward direction was 37,821, and in the reverse it was 37,618. The enthalpy (ΔH′°) of the pyruvate kinase biochemical reaction in the ATP direction was −4.31 kJmol−1 (Fig.1) and calculated from the log K′versus temperature (1/T) where the slope of the line is equal to −ΔH′°/2.303 R (R is the gas constant 8.314 J mol−1K−1). The corresponding entropy (ΔS′°) was +73.4 J mol−1K−1. The equation for the line in Fig. 1 was y = 224.83X + 3.833 (R2 = 0.97).Table IAttainment of equilibrium from the forward and reverse directions for the pyruvate kinase reaction at 25 °CInitial ConcentrationsFinal ConcentrationsK′PKexK′ (pH 7.0, free [Mg2+] = 1.0 mm, I= 0.25 m)[ADP][PEP][ATP][Pyr][ADP][PEP][ATP][Pyr]pHFree[Mg]10−3m25 °C, 10−3mForward direction PEP + ADP = Pyr + ATP 0.500.504.304.700.1330.00564.655.186.9890.6183201636662 0.500.504.304.700.1330.00544.675.216.9800.6163375037986 0.500.504.304.700.1260.00564.825.016.9800.5913405738816Reverse direction Pyr + ATP = PEP + ADP 005.05.100.1370.00504.845.116.9400.5573641539216 005.05.100.1340.00524.705.136.9400.5433443934843 005.05.100.1270.00544.795.046.9500.5643539238795Average K′AK forward direction = 37821 ± 628 (S.E.)

A similar plot was constructed for the chemical reaction P-enolpyruvate3− + ADP3− + H+ = ATP4− + Pyr1−, and the enthalpy and entropy values for the reaction were −6.43 kJmol−1 and +190 J mol−1K−1, respectively. The equation of the line was y = 335.99X + 9.934 (R2= 0.90) (plot not shown). When the magnesium-bound reactants are used in the chemical reaction (MgP-enolpyruvate1− + MgADP1− + H+ = MgATP2− + MgPyr1+), the enthalpy and entropy were −4.10 kJmol−1 and +207 J mol−1K−1, respectively.

The thermodynamic data for the different forms of the pyruvate kinase reaction, including the ΔG′° and equilibrium constants, are summarized in Table II. The effect of pH on the pyruvate kinase equilibrium is shown in Fig.2. As pH varied from 6.40 to 7.8 at free [Mg2+] of 1.0 mm, I = 0.25m, and 25 °C, the K′ for pyruvate kinase decreased by a factor of 10 (from around 100,000 to 10,000). It is also noteworthy that at lower pH the standard errors increased because of the very large equilibrium constants and decreasing micromolar concentrations of P-enolpyruvate and ADP.Table IIThermodynamic properties of the pyruvate kinase reactionBiochemical reactionK′PK [Mg2+] = 1.0 mm pH = 7.0 25 °CΔG′° kJ mol−1 25 °CΔH′° kJ mol−1 5–45 °CΔS′° Jmol−1K−1 5–45 °CTΔS′° kJ mol−1 25 °CPEP + ADP ↔ Pyr + ATP3.89 × 104−26.2−4"
https://openalex.org/W2106807566,"The transcription factor nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NF-AT) plays an essential role in the activation of many early immune response genes. A dynamic equilibrium between calcineurin and cellular kinases controls its phosphorylation and thus regulates its activity by determining its subcellular localization. Here, we demonstrate that T-cell activation in the presence of the bacterial metabolite n-butyrate, which leads to inhibition of interleukin-2 transcription, is characterized by the maintenance of the activity of counter-regulatory kinases glycogen synthase kinase 3 and protein kinase A as well as persistence of intracellular cAMP levels, whereas calcium response and mitogen-activated protein kinase activation were indistinguishable from cells stimulated in the absence of n-butyrate. Nuclear binding of NF-AT was decreased but other transcription factors implicated in interleukin-2 expression such as AP1 and nuclear factor κB were unaffected. The effect on NF-AT binding appeared to be the result of increased nuclear export because the export inhibitor leptomycin B completely restored nuclear binding of NF-AT. We, therefore, provide first evidence for interference with NF-AT regulation alternative to the currently understood inhibition of nuclear import. This mechanism might represent a bacterial strategy to subvert host defense, which could be of particular clinical importance in the gastrointestinal tract where high amounts ofn-butyrate are physiologically present.

Successful T-cell activation characteristically results in enhanced induction of the growth factor IL-2, governing the expansion of antigen-specific T-cells. Mechanistically, IL-2 expression is transcriptionally regulated with the inducible transcription factors activating protein-1 (AP1), nuclear factor κB (NFκB), and nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NF-AT) playing a critical role in this process. Currently,in vivo footprinting data imply that the cooperative occupancy of the binding sites of all three transcription factors at the IL-2 promoter is required for the activation of this gene (1Alberola-Ila J.

Loh C. Rao A. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1995; 7: 333-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). Consequently, functional inhibition of one of these factors is sufficient to inhibit IL-2 production and therefore T-cell activation. This has been demonstrated with the immunosuppressive drug FK506, which selectively blocks the nuclear translocation of NF-AT family members (5Kiani A. Rao A. Aramburu J. Immunity. 2000; 12: 359-372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 6Schreiber S.L. Crabtree G.R. Immunol. Today. 1992; 13: 136-142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1965) Google Scholar). Two such members of the NF-AT family, NF-AT1 and NF-AT2, control the activation of most, if not all, lymphokine genes expressed by T-cells. Upon TCR engagement they are activated via the Ca2+/calcineurin phosphatase pathway, resulting in dephosphorylation and unmasking of the nuclear localization motif and the subsequent translocation to the nucleus (3Crabtree G.R. Clipstone N.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 1045-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar, 7Rao A. Luo C. Hogan P.G. Annu. Rev.

Considerably less is known about the regulation in the export of these factors and thus termination of IL-2 synthesis. Several kinases have been reported to act counter-regulatory to the phosphatase calcineurin with protein kinase A (PKA) and glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK-3) being the best characterized examples. PKA phosphorylation motifs reside within the nuclear localization signal of NF-AT, and phosphorylation of this transcription factor by PKA has been demonstrated in vitro. Phosphorylated NF-AT then appears “primed” for GSK-3, a kinase that has been shown to promote export of NF-AT from the nucleus. It is noteworthy that both kinases are rapidly inactivated upon TCR engagement; however, the in vivo relevance of this down-regulation in the overall activation process remains unclear (9Beals C.R.

As exemplified for the calcineurin inhibitors, which facilitated the exploration of the association between NF-AT import and calcineurin, such a substance would facilitate the elucidation of the pathways connecting the kinases with NF-AT export in vivo. Several lines of evidence indicate that co-evolution of pathogen and host has resulted in the development of microbial strategies to subvert immune surveillance. In general, tactics like stealth, sabotage, or exploitation are applied, which include, for example, usage of immune receptors for infection or sequestration, inhibition of antigen presentation or cytokine production, and induction of tolerance or exploitation of lymphoid activation for spreading infection, respectively (12Brodsky F.M. Immunol. Rev. 1999; 168: 5-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Although much progress has been made recently regarding the recognition of the different ways of subversion, the knowledge about the actual means of interference as well as the molecular mode of action is still limited. The short chain fatty acid n-butyrate is produced in considerable amounts by bacterial fermentation in the human gastrointestinal tract (13Cummings J.H. Pomare E.W. Branch W.J. Naylor C.P. MacFarlane G.T. Gut. 1987; 28: 1221-1227Crossref PubMed Scopus (1967) Google Scholar). In addition to its well known function as an essential energy source for colonocytes, n-butyrate has anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects in vitro andin vivo (14Velazquez O.C. Lederer H.M.

Coll. Surg. Engl. 2001; 83: 75-80PubMed Google Scholar). Regarding T-cells, this bacterial metabolite has been shown to inhibit their expansion in response to (allo-) antigens and mitogens. Furthermore,n-butyrate not only suppresses primary T-cell responses, it also induces antigen-specific tolerance (19Bohmig G.A. Csmarits B. Cerwenka A. Alaei P. Kovarik J. Zlabinger G.J. Transplantation. 1995; 59: 1500-1503Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 20Bohmig G.A. Wekerle T. Saemann M.D. Kovarik J. Zlabinger G.J. Transplant.

Importantly, the recently reported ability of n-butyrate to inhibit antigen-specific immune reactivity in vivo indicates a potential clinical relevance (22Bohmig G.A. Krieger P.M.

Freeman J.P. Fifer E.K. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2000; 294: 1146-1153PubMed Google Scholar). A central feature ofn-butyrate-mediated inhibition of T-cell expansion is the abrogation of IL-2 production (17Saemann M.D. Bohmig G.A. Osterreicher C.H. Burtscher H.,. Parolini O. Diakos C. Stockl J. Horl W.H. Zlabinger G.J. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 2380-2382Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 24Le Gros G.S. Herbert A.G. Watson J.D. Lymphokine Res. 1985; 4: 221-227PubMed Google Scholar), which appears to be an important determinant of anergy induction. To obtain a better understanding of the mode of bacterial interference, we investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying the inhibition of IL-2 production by n-butyrate. Using Jurkat and human primary T-cells, we demonstrate that n-butyrate selectively inhibits NF-AT function in activated T-cells. In contrast to FK506 or other macrolide undecapeptides, n-butyrate does not prevent the nuclear import of NF-AT, but rather promotes its export leading to abrogation of IL-2 synthesis. Such accelerated NF-AT export is accompanied by sustained cAMP levels, as well as PKA and GSK-3 activity akin to that observed in nonstimulated cells. Isolation of T-cells from buffy coats, culturing conditions of Jurkat T-cells and stimulations, reporter gene assays, depletion of protein kinase C (PKC) by prolonged PMA treatment, IL-2 ELISA, Bradford assay, Western blot analysis, preparation of total RNA, radiolabeled probes, nuclear extracts, and electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) were performed as described (25Saemann M.D. Bohmig G.A.

Antibodies directed against tyrosine kinase p56 lck (Lck), linker for activation of T-cells (LAT), GSK-3, and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) were from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY), antibodies against Zap70 were bought from Transduction Laboratories (Franklin Lakes, NJ), and anti-NF-AT1 and anti-NF-AT2 antibodies were from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. and Alexis (San Diego, CA). The p-JNK1/2 antibody was bought from Promega (Madison, WI). Antibodies directed against p-Erk1/2, Erk1/2, JNK1/2, p-p38, p38, p-pan-PKC, p-PKCθ, and p-GSK-3 were from New England Biolabs/Cell Signaling(Beverly, MA). CD3 mAb (OKT3) was from Ortho Diagnostics (Raritan, NJ), CD28 mAb (Leu-28) from BD PharMingen. PMA and ionomycin were bought from Sigma, and (R p)-8-Br-cAMP was fromCalbiochem. 5 μg of total RNA were used in an RNase protection assay, which was performed according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer (Riboquant system, BD PharMingen). 4 × 105 Jurkat T-cells were resuspended in 150 μl of Tyrode/BSA buffer (1.5 mm CaCl2, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 130 mm NaCl, 10 mm HEPES, 0.1% (w/v)d-glucose, 0.1% (w/v) BSA). Subsequently 250 μl of loading solution (20 μm FLUO-3/AM (Molecular Probes, Leiden, The Netherlands), 0.0275% Pluronic F-127 (Molecular Probes)) were added and the cells incubated in a thermomixer (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany) at 600 rpm at 26 °C for 45 min. After incubation, the cells were washed three times with Tyrode/BSA buffer. 5 × 104 cells were analyzed in a Fluoroscan (BMG Lab Technologies, Offenburg, Germany) at an excitation wavelength of 485 nm and an emission wavelength of 538 nm. After the addition of the stimulus, values were recorded every 70 s for 7 min. For immunoprecipitation 1 × 107 Jurkat T-cells were lysed in 1 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 0.5 mmtrisodium orthovanadate, 0.1% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol, 1% Triton X-100, 50 mm NaF, 5 mm tetrasodium pyrophosphate, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.1 mm PMSF, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin) at 4 °C for 1 h with constant rotation. For each sample 50 μl of GammaBind G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) were incubated with 5 μg of anti-GSK-3 antibody in lysis buffer at 4 °C for 1 h with constant rotation. After washing the beads four times with lysis buffer, the cell lysate was added and again incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with constant rotation. Finally, the immunoprecipitate was washed another three times with lysis buffer and two times with GSK-3 kinase buffer (8 mm MOPS, 0.2 mm EDTA, 10 mm magnesium acetate, pH 7.3). 1 μg of glycogen synthetase peptide (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences) were added and the reaction incubated at 30 °C for 30 min. Subsequently reducing sample buffer was added and an aliquot subjected to SDS-PAGE (16% Tricine gel; Novex, La Jolla, CA). The gel was fixed (10% acetic acid, 40% methanol) for 1 h and dried before exposing to a Biomax-MR film (Eastman Kodak Co.). Cellular extracts were obtained and kinase activity assayed using the PKA assay kit (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Upon completion, the reaction was resolved on a 16% Tricine gel (Novex). The gel was fixed (10% acetic acid, 40% methanol) for 1 h and dried before exposing to a Biomax-MR film. Per sample, 1 × 107 Jurkat T-cells were used. Cell lysis and intracellular cAMP measurements were performed using an enzyme immunoassay (BIOTRAK, AmershamBiosciences) according to the manufacturer's protocol. 2 × 107 Jurkat T-cells were either left nonstimulated or activated for 1 min before lysis (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 1 mmtrisodium orthovanadate, 30 mm sodium pyruvate, 10 mm glycerophosphate, 1 mm PMSF, 0.02 units/ml aprotinin, 0.01% sodium azide, and 1% Nonidet P-40 on ice for 10 min). The lysate was mixed 1:1 with an 80% sucrose solution (sucrose had been dissolved in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 125 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA) before loading onto a sucrose gradient. The gradient was generated with the stepwise addition of 2 ml each of 80, 60, 40 (containing the cell lysate), 30, 20, and 10% sucrose. After centrifugation (SW40 rotor with 37,500 rpm for 18 h at 4 °C), 666-μl fractions were collected from the top of the gradient. Protein content of the fractions was determined with a Bradford assay (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's protocol. For the in vitro kinase reaction, 20 and 40% sucrose fractions were pooled (10 μl of each fraction) and diluted to 120 μl in kinase buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.3, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MnCl2). Then 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences) was added and the reaction incubated for 10 min at 30 °C. 20 μl of each reaction were used for SDS-PAGE (4–20% Tris-glycine gel; Novex). After electrophoresis, the gel was fixed (10% acetic acid, 40% methanol) before drying. The gel was then subjected to autoradiography as described above. For immunoprecipitation, 5 μg of rabbit anti-Lck antibody were coupled to 50 μl of Sepharose G beads (AmershamBiosciences). After washing the beads, they were resuspended in 1 ml of buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm PMSF, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm trisodium orthovanadate, and 1 mm sodium fluoride). 200 μl of a radiolabeled kinase reaction from the 20% sucrose fraction (see above) was added and incubated with the beads for 1 h at 4 °C with constant rotation. The beads were subsequently collected by centrifugation and washed four times with the precipitation buffer. The beads were resuspended in SDS sample buffer with subsequent PAGE. After electrophoresis, the gel was fixed and subjected to autoradiography as described above. In the low millimolar concentration range, n-butyrate is known to inhibit alloantigen-stimulated T-cell expansion. Furthermore, it causes antigen-specific hyporesponsiveness in restimulation assays (19Bohmig G.A. Csmarits B. Cerwenka A. Alaei P. Kovarik J. Zlabinger G.J. Transplantation. 1995; 59: 1500-1503Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 20Bohmig G.A. Wekerle T. Saemann M.D. Kovarik J. Zlabinger G.J. Transplant.

Transplantation. 1982; 33: 534-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). This phenomenon is accompanied by a strong suppression of T-cell produced cytokines. To address the corresponding molecular mechanism of n-butyrate, we have chosen the Jurkat T-cell line as a model system. As a surrogate readout for the inhibitory effects of this compound, anti-CD3/CD28-induced IL-2 production as determined by ELISA was used (Fig.1 A). Whenn-butyrate (1 mm) was added at culture initiation, TCR-driven IL-2 secretion was prevented. To crudely address the level of inhibition (transcriptionally or post-transcriptionally), an RNase protection assay was performed to measure IL-2 steady state mRNA levels. Although upon TCR engagement IL-2 mRNA increased compared with nonstimulated cells (no RNA detectable; see Fig.1 B, lanes 1 and 2),n-butyrate totally blocked this induction (Fig.1 B, lanes 2 and 3). This finding indicates that the generation of a stable IL-2 message was prevented. To further demonstrate that IL-2 transcription is affected by n-butyrate, induction of an IL-2 promoter-driven luciferase reporter gene was evaluated. Again, in this settingn-butyrate strongly reduced IL-2 promoter-dependent luciferase synthesis after stimulation with CD3/CD28 mAb or PMA plus ionomycin (Fig. 1 C). These data confirm that Jurkat T-cells are a suitable model system to investigate the molecular mechanisms responsible forn-butyrate-mediated IL-2 inhibition, showing that the block affects the assembly of the transcription factor machinery at the IL-2 promoter. n-Butyrate is known to cause diminished population doubling rates, altered morphology, decreased anchorage-independent growth, and increased expression of colon epithelial differentiation marker enzymes such as alkaline phosphatase in colon carcinoma cells (33Archer S. Meng S., Wu, J. Johnson J. Tang R. Hodin R. Surgery. 1998; 124: 248-253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 34Coradini D. Pellizzaro C. Marimpietri D. Abolafio G. Daidone M.G. Cell Prolif. 2000; 33: 139-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 35Herz F. Halwer M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 762: 289-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The latter effects were attributed to a decreased activity of p56 lck (36Foss F.M. Veillette A. Sartor O. Rosen N. Bolen J.B. Oncogene Res. 1989; 5: 13-23PubMed Google Scholar), a protein-tyrosine kinase that plays an essential role in TCR stimulation. In activated Lck−/− T-cells, endogenous Fyn predominantly substitutes for this kinase with one notable exception, the activation of NF-AT and consequently IL-2 production (37Denny M.F. Patai B. Straus D.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1426-1435Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The latter is reminiscent of the effects observed withn-butyrate in our model system. It was therefore decided to investigate the function of Lck in terms of its localization in (lipid) rafts and its associated kinase activity in Jurkat T-cells stimulated in the presence or absence of n-butyrate (1 mm). As illustrated (Fig. 2 A), there is successful separation of rafts (20% sucrose fraction)versus the bulk of the cytoplasmic proteins (40% sucrose fraction) confirmed with Western blot analysis of marker proteins. As described, LAT was clearly detected in both fractions (comparelanes 1, 3, and 5, corresponding to the rafts, with lanes 2,4, and 6, corresponding to the cytosolic preparation). In addition, trace amounts of Lck (comparable with the 5.8% that were reported recently) were seen in the raft compartment (see especially lanes 3 and 5). In contrast, PI3K and Zap70, which both comprise cytoplasmic proteins, are exclusively present within the 40% fraction (Fig. 2 A,lanes 2, 4, and 6). To normalize for protein content, a Bradford assay was performed showing equal amounts of protein independent of the activation status of the cells (Fig. 2 B). However, in an in vitro kinase assay using the isolated rafts as source of kinase activity, increased phosphorylation of a protein corresponding to the size of Lck (56 kDa) was detected 1 min after an anti-CD3/CD28 stimulation (Fig.2 C, lanes 1 and 2). This induction was blocked after drug treatment (Fig. 2 C,lanes 2 and 3). The identity of this activity/protein band was further revealed by immunoprecipitation analysis as p56 lck . Substitution of Lck by Fyn in Lck−/− T-cells leads to an indistinguishable activation of both major signaling pathways after TCR stimulation. Ca2+ mobilization and the branched Ras/Rac-activated protein kinase cascades with Erk and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) phosphorylation taken as endpoints were essentially unaffected in these Lck−/−cells (26August A. Dupont B. Tissue Antigens. 1995; 46: 155-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). A similar result was observed in Jurkat T-cells stimulated in the presence of 1 mm n-butyrate (Fig.3, A and B). Such treatment had no effect on Ca2+ mobilization during the first 7 min after anti-CD3/CD28 stimulation (Fig. 3 A). Additionally Erk1/2 and p38 were phosphorylated/activated independent of whether n-butyrate is applied, as illustrated in a time kinetic analysis by Western blotting using phosphospecific antibodies (Fig. 3 B). Regarding JNK, constitutive phosphorylation was observed, which was not influenced by n-butyrate (Fig.3 B). PKC, which comprise a parallel and/or alternative activation pathway to the MAPK (38Berridge M.J. Crit. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 17: 155-178Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), also became fully activated as visualized in a pan-phospho-PKC- and a phospho-PKCθ-specific Western blot analysis in the presence of 1 mm n-butyrate (Fig. 3 C, lanes 2 and 3). To rule out that any PKC isoform conveys a negative signal resulting in the observed suppression of IL-2 transcription, Jurkat T-cells were depleted of the classical and novel isoforms by a prolonged treatment with PMA. However, in an IL-2 reporter gene assay, these cells were still susceptible to n-butyrate-mediated inhibition (Fig.3 D). This strongly indicated that the suppressive effect observed is not mediated by PKC activities. As the major activating pathways are unaffected byn-butyrate, we started to explore cascades that are abrogated in the course of T-cell activation and regarded to act negatively. Li et al. (39Li L. Yee C. Beavo J.A. Science. 1999; 283: 848-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar) recently reported that anti-CD3/CD28 triggering of Jurkat T-cells is accompanied by a decrease in the intracellular concentration of cAMP. In contrast, it is well known that increased cAMP levels negatively impact upon T-cell activation including IL-2 production (8Masuda E.S. Imamura R. Amasaki Y. Arai K. Arai N. Cell Signal. 1998; 10: 599-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 40Tsuruta L. Lee H.J. Masuda E.S. Yokota T. Arai N. Arai K. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 1995; 96: 1126-1135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Our results with Jurkat T-cells showing a reduction of ∼50% in intracellular cAMP level 15 min after anti-CD3/CD28 stimulation are in line with these reports (Fig. 4 A). Importantly, pretreatment with n-butyrate for 30 min prevented this effect, providing a situation identical to that observed in nonstimulated cells. cAMP-dependent PKA reflects the concentration of its co-factor (41Beebe S.J. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1994; 5: 285-294PubMed Google Scholar). Using whole cell lysates and a PKA-specific peptide as a substrate, we found that n-butyrate greatly preserves the kinase activity comparable with those of resting cells. Stimulated cells, in contrast, responded with a strong decrease in kinase activity (Fig. 4 B, lanes 1–3). To support these findings functionally, the effect of the selective PKA inhibitor (R p)-8-Br-cAMP (42Schwede F. Maronde E. Genieser H. Jastorff B. Pharmacol. Ther. 2000; 87: 199-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) on IL-2 transcription was studied in an IL-2 reporter gene assay. 100 μm amount of the analog reverses the inhibition of IL-2 transcription byn-butyrate (Fig. 4 C). This finding therefore strongly implies that sustained PKA activity is causally involved in the abrogation of IL-2 synthesis upon drug treatment. In T-cells previous data imply that PKA and GSK-3 together negatively influence cytoplasmic components of NF-AT, a major transcription factor at the IL-2 promoter. In addition, retrovirus-mediated overexpression of GSK-3 was recently shown to prevent T-cell proliferation and IL-2 synthesis (9Beals C.R. Sheridan C.M. Turck C.W. Gardner P. Crabtree G.R. Science. 1997; 275: 1930-1934Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar, 11Ohteki T. Parsons M. Zakarian A. Jones R.G. Nguyen L.T. Woodgett J.R. Ohashi P.S. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 99-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). In model organisms (Dictyostelium), this usually constitutively active kinase is regulated by Wnt/Wg signaling or alternatively by cAMP (43Kim L. Kimmel A.R. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2000; 10: 508-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). This prompted us to investigate the importance of this kinase in our butyrate model. Western blot analysis (Fig. 5 A) with extracts from Jurkat T-cells using a phosphospecific anti-GSK-3 antibody directed against the negative regulation site(s) serine 9/21 (GSKβ/GSKα) was performed. Levels of phospho-GSK increase significantly after anti-CD3/CD28 stimulation, a response that is prevented byn-butyrate addition (Fig. 5 A). This posttranslational modification correlates with kinase activity (Fig.5 B). Immunoprecipitated GSK-3 from the same Jurkat cell lysate was used in an in vitro kinase assay with a glycogen synthase peptide as a substrate. Both nonstimulated andn-butyrate-treated Jurkat T-cells have high levels of GSK-3 activity (Fig. 5 B, lanes 1 and4). In contrast, stimulation with anti-CD3/CD28 that led to a phosphorylation at Ser 9/21 correlates with markedly reduced kinase activity (Fig. 5 B, lane 2). Becausen-butyrate did not affect activity when added to extracts of stimulated T-cells (Fig. 5 B, lane 3), a direct effect upon GSK-3 appears unlikely. To link these findings functionally with the observed inhibition of IL-2 transcription, the eff"

(1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 16852–16861). At low molar excess of Hsc70 pmAAT is recovered in insoluble aggregates containing equal amounts of Hsc70. However, in the presence of a large excess of Hsc70, refolding of pmAAT is still arrested, but the enzyme remains in solution. Similar behavior was observed with two other cytosolic chaperones, bovine Hsp90 and yeast Ydj1. Coimmunoprecipitation of pmAAT using Hsc70 antibodies confirmed the formation of soluble Hsc70-pmAAT complexes at high concentrations of the chaperone. Data from analytical centrifugation, sedimentation in glycerol gradients, and partial purification of the soluble complexes indicate that multiple Hsc70 molecules bind per pmAAT polypeptide chain. The absence of catalytic activity together with the protease susceptibility of pmAAT bound to Hsc70, Hsp90, or Ydj1 suggest that these chaperones bind and maintain pmAAT in a partially unfolded state, analogous to the import-competent conformation of the protein synthesized in cell-free extracts. Remarkably, the purified pmAAT bound to Hsc70 or Ydj1, but not to Hsp90, is imported by isolated mitochondria in a reticulocyte lysate-dependent manner. Thus, both Hsc70 and Ydj1 can trap an import-competent folding intermediate of pmAAT, but productive binding and import into mitochondria require the collaboration of additional cytosolic factors from the lysate.

Acta. 1999; 1422: 235-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Although some proteins might be imported cotranslationally (3Verner K. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 366-371Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 4Lithgow T. FEBS Lett. 2000; 476: 22-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), for the majority of proteins import can take place posttranslationally, both in vitro and in vivo (1Neupert W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 863-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (981) Google Scholar, 5Schatz G. Dobberstein B. Science. 1996; 271: 1519-1526Crossref PubMed Scopus (922) Google Scholar). In addition, it is well known that mitochondrial precursors are not imported into mitochondria in their native state (6Eilers M. Schatz G. Nature. 1986; 322: 228-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar, 7Wienhues U. Becker K. Schleyer M. Guiard B. Tropschug M. Horwich A.L. Pfanner N. Neupert W. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1601-1609Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The degree of folding of the import substrate compatible with translocation varies among precursors. Some proteins can be presented to mitochondria in their native conformation, and mitochondria are able to unfold them during translocation (8Matouscheck A. Pfanner N. Voos W. EMBO Rep. 2000; 1: 404-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). These proteins usually do not require ATP hydrolysis outside the mitochondria for translocation. The import of many other mitochondrial precursors, including the precursor for rat liver aspartate aminotransferase (pmAAT)1used in this work, requires extramitochondrial ATP (9Mattingly J.R., Jr. Youseff J. Iriarte A. Martinez-Carrion M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3925-3937Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Wachter C. Schatz G. Glick B.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 465-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), probably for their release from complexes with cytosolic chaperones. It is likely that these mitochondrial precursors never fold in the cytosol and engage the translocation machinery when still in a partially unfolded state. In fact, the folding of pmAAT synthesized in a cell-free extract is inhibited by cytosolic factors, and once the protein is folded mitochondria can no longer import it (9Mattingly J.R., Jr. Youseff J. Iriarte A. Martinez-Carrion M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3925-3937Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The interaction with cytosolic chaperones might prevent not only premature folding but also aggregation and proteolysis of the incompletely folded polypeptides. The requirement for cytosolic proteins may not be universal because some precursor proteins can be imported in vitro into mitochondria in the absence of cytosolic extracts (6Eilers M. Schatz G. Nature. 1986; 322: 228-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar,11Becker K. Guiard B. Rassow J. Sölner T. Pfanner N. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5637-5643Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is clear that the requirements for the delivery of newly synthesized precursors to the outer mitochondrial membrane differ among precursor proteins and may depend on factors such as overall hydrophobicity or oligomeric state of the native mature protein. Cytosolic components reportedly performing this chaperone function for mitochondrial precursors include members of the Hsp70 and Hsp40 (DnaJ-related) family of molecular chaperones (1Neupert W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 863-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (981) Google Scholar). The constitutively expressed cytosolic member of the Hsp70 family of molecular chaperones (Hsc70) is involved in a broad spectrum of cellular processes (12McKay D.B. Adv. Protein Chem. 1993; 44: 67-98Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Bukau B. Horwich A.L. Cell. 1998; 92: 351-366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2435) Google Scholar, 14Frydman J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 603-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (944) Google Scholar). Its chaperone activity is regulated by a number of co-chaperones, including members of the Hsp40 family that stimulate its ATPase activity and promote substrate association with Hsp70 (14Frydman J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 603-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (944) Google Scholar, 15Cyr D.M. Langer T. Douglas M.G. Trends Biochem.

Both Hsc70 and Hsp40 bind to nascent chains as they elongate on cytoplasmic ribosomes (17Beckman R.P. Mizzen L.A. Welch W.J. Science. 1990; 248: 850-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (1047) Google Scholar, 18Frydman J. Nimmesgern E. Ohtsuka K. Hartl F.U.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3981-3989Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar), and evidence has been accumulating in support of a general role for these chaperones in the translocation of mitochondrial proteins. Depletion of Hsp70 proteins in yeast mutants interfered with the biogenesis of mitochondrial proteins (20Deshaires R.J. Koch B.D. Werner-Washburne M. Craig E.A. Chekman R. Nature. 1988; 332: 800-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (1005) Google Scholar), and the yeast DnaJ homologue Ydj1 was initially isolated as MAS5, a mutation that causes defects in mitochondrial import in yeast (21Atencio D.P. Yaffe M.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 283-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Furthermore, both Hsc70 and the DnaJ homologues dj2 or dj3 appear to be required for import of preornithine decarboxylase translated in vitro into mammalian mitochondria (22Terada K. Kanazawa M. Bukau B. Mori M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1089-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 23Terada K. Ohtsuka K. Imamoto N. Yoneda Y. Mori M. Mol. Cell.

Additional cytosolic components such as the presequence binding factor (PBF) (25Murakami K. Mori M. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3201-3208Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) and the mitochondrial import stimulation factor (MSF) (26Hachiya N. Komiya T. Alam R. Iwahashi J. Sakaguchi M. Omura T. Mihara K. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5146-5154Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) may have a more specific role as targeting factors. On the other hand, eukaryotic Hsp90s are unique among molecular chaperones in that they display considerable specificity for their substrate proteins. Although purified Hsp90 has been shown to prevent the in vitro aggregation of some unfolded proteins, the majority of their known substrates in vivo are signal transduction proteins, including a variety of hormone and growth factor receptors (27Caplan A.J. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 262-268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 28Young J.C. Moarefi I. Hartl F.U. J.

Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 1109-1116Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In addition, Hsp90 has been shown to bind proteins thought to be involved in targeted protein traffic in yeast via their tetratricopeptide repeat domains (30Owens-Grillo J.K. Czar M.J. Hutchison K.A. Hoffmann K. Perdew G.H. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13468-13475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). An early report (31Scherrer L.C. Hutchison K.A. Sanchez E.R. Randall S.K. Pratt W.B. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 7325-7329Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) described the isolation of a fraction from rabbit reticulocyte lysate (RRL) containing Hsp90 and Hsp70, which both stimulated import into mitochondria of a hybrid precursor protein and mediated formation of Hsp90-steroid receptor heterocomplexes. Yet the involvement of Hsp90 on protein translocation remains obscure. We have shown previously that cytosolic Hsc70 binds to pmAAT both during translation in a cell-free extract (32Lain B. Iriarte A. Martinez-Carrion M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15588-15596Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and in vitrorefolding of the acid-unfolded protein (33Artigues A. Iriarte A. Martinez-Carrion M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16852-16861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Subsequently we identified seven putative Hsc70-binding sites in the pmAAT polypeptide (34Artigues A. Crawford D.L. Iriarte A. Martinez-Carrion M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33130-33134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) which included the cleavable presequence peptide in addition to several peptide regions in the mature portion of the protein. The complexes obtained at low molar excess of Hsc70 over purified unfolded pmAAT were insoluble and formed aggregates containing equal amounts of the two proteins (33Artigues A. Iriarte A. Martinez-Carrion M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16852-16861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Thus, a question remained as to whether Hsc70 was able to bind simultaneously to several of the binding sites in pmAAT. Here we report that in the presence of high concentrations of Hsc70, purified pmAAT forms soluble complexes containing multiple Hsc70 molecules bound to a single pmAAT polypeptide. Soluble complexes can also be assembled with purified yeast YDJ1 and mammalian Hsp90 and unfolded pmAAT. The import competence of these complexes is chaperone-specific. Mitochondria were unable to import Hsp90-bound pmAAT, whereas import from the complexes with Hsc70 or Ydj1 requires the presence of reticulocyte lysate. This contrasts previous reports on the import of another matrix protein, preadrenodoxin, from preassembled complexes with Hsp70 or MSF which could take place in the absence of a cytosolic extract or even ATP (35Komiya T. Sakaguchi M. Mihara K. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 399-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). To our knowledge this is the first report of in vitro import of a mitochondrial protein from a preassembled Hsp40-precursor complex. The expression in Escherichia coli and purification of the histidine-tagged protein pmAAT(His6)Tyr, a protein construct containing a tag of six histidines and a tyrosine residue fused to the C-terminal end of pmAAT, was carried out as described previously (36Mattingly J.R., Jr. Torella C. Iriarte A. Martinez-Carrion M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23191-23202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) using metal chelation chromatography in a Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA)-agarose column (Qiagen). The mature form of the protein, mAAT(His6)Tyr, was obtained by incubating the precursor with trypsin (1:100 trypsin/pmAAT(His6)Tyr molar ratio) to remove the N-terminal presequence peptide, followed by chromatography on a CM-Sephadex column. Protein concentration was estimated from the absorbance at 280 nm using the calculated molar absorption coefficient of 55,610 m−1 cm−1 (36Mattingly J.R., Jr. Torella C. Iriarte A. Martinez-Carrion M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23191-23202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) andM r = 48,540 and 45,824 for the precursor and mature protein, respectively. Because all the experiments reported in this work were performed using this tagged protein construct, for brevity and clarity of exposure we will omit the suffix (His6)Tyr and we will refer to these proteins as pmAAT for the precursor or mAAT for the mature form. Hsc70 was purified from bovine brain following published procedures (37Welch W.J. Feramisco J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 1229-1237Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was estimated using the published ε (280 nm) = 47,800m−1 cm−1 andM r = 70,000 (38Palleros D.R. Welch W.J. Fink A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5719-5723Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Hsp90 was purified from bovine brain as described previously (39Welch W.J. Feramisco J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 14949-14959Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Ydj1 was expressed in E. coli and purified according to Cyr et al. (40Cyr D.M., Lu, X. Douglas M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20927-20931Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Hsp90 and Ydj1 protein concentrations were determined from the intensity of Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-PAGE gels, using mAAT as standard. The purified proteins were stored at 4 °C. Radiolabeled pmAAT was prepared by incubating the protein (200 μg) with 2 μmNa125I (1 μCi) in 100 μl of refolding buffer (100 mm Hepes, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 μmdithiothreitol) in an IODO-GEN-coated tube (Sigma) for 30 min at room temperature. The reaction was quenched by addition of 5 μl of 100 mm NaI and 5 μl of 4 mm hydroxymethyl acetate, followed by extensive dialysis in refolding buffer. The final specific radioactivity of the labeled protein was 300,000 dpm/μg. Syncatalytic modification of pmAAT with 5-iodoacetamidofluorescein (5-IAF) was achieved by incubation of pmAAT (1 mg/ml) in refolding buffer with 2 mm 5-IAF in the presence of 50 mmof the substrate analogue α-methyl aspartate. After incubation for 4 h at room temperature, the excess of 5-IAF and α-methyl aspartate was removed by ultrafiltration through a Centricon 30 (Amicon). The resulting AF-labeled pmAAT (AF-pmAAT) contains a strong absorbance reporting group (ε492 nm = 75,000m−1 cm−1) suitable to follow the sedimentation profiles of pmAAT and its complex with Hsc70 during analytical ultracentrifugation. The concentration of the modified proteins was estimated from the Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-PAGE gels by comparing the intensity of the protein bands with standards of known concentrations of unlabeled mAAT. Acid unfolding of 125I- or 5-AF-labeled pmAAT was performed by incubation in 2 mm Tris acidified to pH 2.0 with HCl for 90 min at room temperature. The final protein concentration was calculated from the specific radioactivity of the125I-labeled protein. Binding of pmAAT to Hsc70, Hsp90, or Ydj1 was accomplished by diluting the acid-denatured protein with 10 volumes of ice-cold refolding buffer containing a given chaperone followed by incubation for 90 min at 10 °C. The final concentration of pmAAT monomer in the reaction was 2.5 × 10−3μm monomer, and the concentration of each molecular chaperone was 1.8 μm, unless indicated otherwise. Trypsin digestion was performed at 4 °C by addition of a concentrated stock solution of TPCK-trypsin in 1 mm HCl to give a final Hsc70/trypsin molar ratio of 200:1. In control experiments using Hsc70 alone, we found that with this trypsin/Hsc70 ratio about 90% of Hsc70 remains intact even after a 1-h incubation at 4 °C. To evaluate the extent of proteolysis of both chaperone and pmAAT, samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and visualized either in a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImagerTM(125I-pmAAT) or by staining with Coomassie Blue (Hsc70). Immunoprecipitation reactions of Hsc70-125I-pmAAT complexes (60 μl) were performed by addition of an equal volume of rabbit anti-Hsc70 polyclonal antibodies diluted 1:1 in PBS buffer, 5 mm EDTA, and 0.1% Triton X-100. The same amount of preimmune serum was used as a control. Following incubation for 4 h at 10 °C, 60 μl of protein A-agarose (Repligen) was added to each reaction, and the samples were incubated for an additional hour at 4 °C with gentle shaking. The suspensions were centrifuged at maximum speed on a microcentrifuge. The supernatants were diluted in SDS sample buffer, and the pellets, following an additional wash in phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1% Triton X-100, 5 mm EDTA, were resuspended in SDS sample buffer and heated at 60 °C for 20 min. The agarose beads were pelleted by centrifugation, and the supernatants were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and PhosphorImaging. Determination of the sedimentation coefficient of the AF-labeled pmAAT alone or in complex with Hsc70 was done on a Beckman XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge, using an AN-60 Ti analytical rotor. Samples were centrifuged at 30,000 or 15,000 rpm for AF-pmAAT alone or Hsc70-AF-pmAAT complexes, respectively. Sedimentation coefficients were estimated from the absorbance boundary profiles at 492 nm (the λmax of fluorescein) using the software provided with the instrument. Native Hsc70 (1.8 μm) and pmAAT (2.5 × 10−3μm) as well as samples of Hsc70-pmAAT complex formation reactions were layered on top of a 5-ml 10–30% glycerol gradient in refolding buffer. The gradients were preformed on a Biocomp model 106 gradient maker following the manufacturer's instructions. Samples were centrifuged at 55,000 rpm for 4 h on a TLX Beckman ultracentrifuge using a TLX-L rotor. Following fractionation of the gradients on a Retriever II (Isco), the fractions were analyzed for the presence of125I-pmAAT by counting aliquots on a Beckman Gamma 5500 counter and for the presence of Hsc70 by SDS-PAGE followed by staining the gels with Coomassie Blue. Mitochondria were isolated from male Wistar rat liver as described previously (41Parsons D.F. Williams G.R. Chance B. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1966; 137: 643-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar) and resuspended in MESH buffer (220 mm mannitol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 70 mmsucrose, 20 mm HEPPS, pH 7.4). The import reaction was performed by mixing 40 μl of Hsc70-125I-pmAAT complexes with 40 μl of freshly isolated mitochondria (4 mg/ml final concentration) and 40 μl of RRL or MESH buffer containing ATP and an ATP-regenerating system (200 μm MgATP, 2 mg/ml creatine kinase, 500 μm creatine phosphate, 400 mmμm malate, 400 μm succinate, 200 μm NADH, in MESH buffer, pH 7.4). The reaction mixture was incubated for 30 min at 30 °C. After stopping import by chilling on ice, an aliquot was taken and mixed with an equal volume of SDS-PAGE sample buffer. The remaining of the reaction was centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 4 min, and the pellet containing the reisolated mitochondria was washed twice with 200 μl of MESH buffer and finally resuspended in an adequate volume of MESH buffer. Aliquots of this mitochondrial fraction were either left untreated and mixed directly with SDS-PAGE sample buffer (sample 1) or treated with 20 μg/ml l-tosylamido-2-phenylethylchloromethylketone (TPCK)-trypsin for 30 min on ice either in the absence (sample 2) or presence (sample 3) of 0.1% Triton X-100. The trypsin digestion was terminated by addition of 0.5 μl of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and the samples were mixed with an equal volume of SDS-PAGE sample buffer. All samples were subsequently analyzed by SDS-PAGE and exposure to a PhosphorImager screen. The amount of protein bound to mitochondria (sample 1), imported into mitochondria (sample 2), or imported and properly folded (sample 3) was estimated from the intensity of the corresponding radiolabeled protein band and is expressed as percentage relative to the intensity of the pmAAT band in the unfractionated import reaction. The protein construct used in this work contains an LEHHHHHHY tag fused to the C-terminal end of pmAAT. The addition of this C-terminal tail does not alter the overall stability, catalytic properties, or refolding ability of the enzyme (data not shown), but it provides a convenient tool for the purification and detection of the protein. The histidine tag allows for rapid purification of the protein using metal affinity resins, whereas the C-terminal tyrosine can be easily iodinated for radiolabeling purposes. Hsc70 binds refolding intermediates of acid-denatured pmAAT and prevents further folding and reactivation of the enzyme (33Artigues A. Iriarte A. Martinez-Carrion M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16852-16861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The nature of the complexes formed depends on the concentration of Hsc70 in the refolding reaction. At a low molar excess of Hsc70, the resulting complexes contain stoichiometric amounts of pmAAT and Hsc70 and form insoluble aggregates that can be removed by centrifugation (Fig.1). However, the fraction of pmAAT recovered in the supernatant increases with increasing concentrations of Hsc70 until all of the pmAAT remains in solution at molar ratios of Hsc70 over pmAAT of 200 or higher (Fig. 1). Yet no transaminase activity is detected in the supernatant, which indicates that the soluble pmAAT is not completely folded. The inactive soluble pmAAT could be immunoprecipitated using Hsc70 polyclonal antibodies (Fig.2), which confirms that the pmAAT in the supernatant is indeed bound to Hsc70. The solubility of these complexes is marginal, and they readily precipitate when the sample is concentrated slightly after preparation (data not shown). Native pmAAT, either alone or in the presence of an excess of Hsc70, did not precipitate with anti-Hsc70 antibodies (data not shown). Similar concentration-dependent formation of insoluble or soluble complexes was observed with two other chaperones, Hsp90 and Ydj1 (Fig.1).Figure 2Coimmunoprecipitation of pmAAT with Hsc70 antibodies. Immunoprecipitation reactions of Hsc70-125pmAAT soluble complexes were performed as indicated under “Experimental Procedures” using rabbit preimmune or anti-Hsc70 whole antiserum. Both supernatants (Sn) and pellets (P) were resuspended in SDS sample buffer to the same final volume and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The dried gels were exposed overnight to a PhosphorImager screen, and the radiolabeled protein bands were detected on a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImagerTM.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) A possible explanation for the different behavior of the complexes formed at low and high concentrations of Hsc70 is that the soluble complexes contain multiple Hsc70 molecules associated with a single pmAAT polypeptide. To determine the stoichiometry of the complexes, we first isolated the complex from the large excess of Hsc70 present in the complex formation reaction by metal chelation chromatography in a Ni-NTA column taking advantage of the presence of the histidine tag at the C-terminal end of pmAAT. In control experiments we established that Hsc70 alone does not bind to the column and elutes with the loading buffer. On the other hand, histidine-tagged native pmAAT binds very tightly but can be eluted with 110 mm imidazole. When Hsc70-pmAAT complexes were loaded on the column, the majority of Hsc70 eluted with the loading buffer, as expected considering the large excess of Hsc70 present in the mixture. SDS-PAGE analysis of the material bound to the resin showed the presence of Hsc70 together with pmAAT (data not shown). Following visualization either by Coomassie Blue staining (Hsc70) or autoradiography (125I-pmAAT), the amount of each protein bound to the Ni-NTA resin was estimated from the intensity of the corresponding electrophoretic bands, using known concentrations of each protein as standards (see “Experimental Procedures” for details). According to these measurements, we found that on average between 5 and 7 molecules of Hsc70 are bound to each pmAAT polypeptide chain. This figure represents only a rough approximation because several factors such as dissociation of Hsc70 from low affinity binding sites during purification of the complex could influence the estimate. In any case, it is clear that several Hsc70 molecules must bind to a single pmAAT polypeptide in order to prevent aggregation and subsequent precipitation of the complex. Moreover, this stoichiometry is in good agreement with the number of Hsc70-binding sites (seven) identified in the pmAAT sequence by screening a synthetic peptide library (34Artigues A. Crawford D.L. Iriarte A. Martinez-Carrion M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33130-33134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Interestingly, attempts at eluting the proteins from the Ni-NTA resin with high concentrations of imidazole were unsuccessful. Only solubilization with SDS-PAGE sample buffer released the bound proteins. A possible explanation for these findings is that the tight binding of the Hsc70-pmAAT complexes to the resin involves not only specific interactions of the histidine tag with the Ni2+ immobilized in the Ni-NTA resin but also nonspecific interactions of nonnative pmAAT with the solid matrix. This conclusion is supported by the observation that in vitro translated wild type pmAAT, which is also partially unfolded, binds not only to Ni-NTA resins but also to several other agarose-based solid supports. 2C. Tanase and A. Iriarte, unpublished observations. The hydrodynamic properties of these soluble complexes were further characterized using ultracentrifugation methods. To follow the distribution of pmAAT during boundary sedimentation velocity experiments in the presence of high concentrations of Hsc70, pmAAT was selectively labeled with 5-IAF at Cys-166 (42Berezov A. Iriarte A. Martinez-Carrion M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22222-22229Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Upon labeling, native pmAAT loses ∼50–60% of the original activity. This chromophore was selected because of its high molar extinction coefficient (75,000m−1 cm−1) at 492 nm which allowed the detection of small amounts of pmAAT during ultracentrifugation by absorption optics. When native AF-pmAAT is analyzed, it sed"
https://openalex.org/W2076375957,"Flap endonuclease-1 (FEN-1) is a critical enzyme for DNA replication and repair. Intensive studies have been carried out on its structure-specific nuclease activities and biological functions in yeast cells. However, its specific interactions with DNA substrates as an initial step of catalysis are not defined. An understanding of the ability of FEN-1 to recognize and bind a flap DNA substrate is critical for the elucidation of its molecular mechanism and for the explanation of possible pathological consequences resulting from its failure to bind DNA. Using human FEN-1 in this study, we identified two positively charged amino acid residues, Arg-47 and Arg-70 in human FEN-1, as candidates responsible for substrate binding. Mutation of the Arg-70 significantly reduced flap endonuclease activity and eliminated exonuclease activity. Mutation or protonation of Arg-47 shifted cleavage sites with flap substrate and significantly reduced the exonuclease activity. We revealed that these alterations are due to the defects in DNA-protein interactions. Although the effect of the single Arg-47 mutation on binding activities is not as severe as R70A, its double mutation with Asp-181 had a synergistic effect. Furthermore the possible interaction sites of these positively charged residues with DNA substrates were discussed based on FEN-1 cleavage patterns using different substrates. Finally data were provided to indicate that the observed negative effects of a high concentration of Mg2+ on enzymatic activity are probably due to the competition between the arginine residues and metal ions with DNA substrate since mutants were found to be less tolerant.

Although the effect of the single Arg-47 mutation on binding activities is not as severe as R70A, its double mutation with Asp-181 had a synergistic effect. Furthermore the possible interaction sites of these positively charged residues with DNA substrates were discussed based on FEN-1 cleavage patterns using different substrates. Finally data were provided to indicate that the observed negative effects of a high concentration of Mg2+ on enzymatic activity are probably due to the competition between the arginine residues and metal ions with DNA substrate since mutants were found to be less tolerant. flap endonuclease-1 proliferating cell nuclear antigen human FEN-1 position nucleotide(s) Flap endonuclease-1 (FEN-1)1 proteins possess a flap endonuclease activity as well as a 5′ to 3′ exonuclease activity (1Waga S.

FEN-1 localizes into the nucleus in S phase during DNA synthesis as well as in response to DNA damage (15Qiu J., Li, X. Frank G. Shen B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4901-4908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In yeast, loss of FEN-1 functions was determined to cause severely impaired phenotypes such as conditional lethality, dramatic increase of cellular sensitivity to alkylating agents,e.g. methyl methanesulfonate, and significant increase in the mutation rate. Interestingly a majority of mutations in the yFEN-1 mutant strains are large sequence duplications (10Tishkoff D.X. Filosi N. Gaida G.M. Kolodner R.D. Cell. 1997; 88 (263): 263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (394) Google Scholar). Duplication mutations in humans have been associated with disorders such as recessive retinitis pigmentosa, lethal junctional epidermolysis bullosa, familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and cancer. FEN-1 is also a key enzyme for preventing expansion and contraction of bi- or trinucleotide repeats (16Gordenin D.A. Kunkel T.A. Resnick M.A. Nat.

More recently we have demonstrated that FEN-1 nuclease plays an important role in limiting short sequence recombination for yeast genome stability (20Negritto M.C. Qiu J. Ratay D.O. Shen B. Bailis A.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2349-2358Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). All of these observations illustrate its critical roles in genome integrity. As an essential gene for DNA replication, FEN-1 defects resulting in a complete loss of function are unlikely to exist in the human population (21Kunkel T.A. Resnick M.A. Gordenin D.A.

Cancer. 2000; 88: 938-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). A comprehensive structural and functional analysis of single amino acid residue mutations will assist in the formulation of models for biological and pathological roles of this enzyme. Initial domain analysis based on protein sequence comparison and biochemical assays displayed two major conserved motifs, N (N-terminal) and I (intermediate) motifs, which are essential for the nuclease activities of FEN-1 proteins (4Harrington J.J. Lieber M.R. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1344-1355Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 23Shen B. Qiu J. Hosfield D. Tainer J.A. TIBS. 1998; 23: 171-173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). A third motif at the C-terminal end is involved in the interaction of FEN-1 proteins with PCNA (23Shen B.

Although we have recently demonstrated that stimulation of eukaryotic FEN-1 activities by PCNA is independent of its in vitrointeraction via a consensus PCNA binding region (25Frank G. Qiu J. Zheng L. Shen B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36295-36302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), the interaction may be crucial for PCNA to recruit FEN-1 onto Okazaki fragment processing and DNA damage sites (24Warbrick E.

In recent years, we have performed site-directed mutagenesis on human FEN-1 nuclease coupled with biochemical and yeast genetic analysis. A number of amino acid residues, which are critical for biochemical and biological functions, have been revealed through this ongoing endeavor.

To identify amino acid residues directly involved in substrate binding, we constructed a three-dimensional molecular model for human FEN-1 based on the available homologous crystal structures (29Kim Y.

We have identified 10 amino acid residues including Arg-29, Arg-47, Arg-70, Arg-73, Lys-80, Lys-93, Lys-99, Arg-100, Arg-103, and Arg-104 as candidate residues that directly interact with DNA substrates. These residues are conserved in eukaryotes and are located on the surface of the molecule. We have performed site-directed mutagenesis on these residues. Indeed individual mutations of many of these residues affect biochemical activities. The first five residues are located in the N-terminal α-helix and β-sheet region near the active center of the enzyme, while the other five residues are exclusively in the loop region, which has been proposed to interact with the single-stranded flap of the DNA substrate (32Hosfield D. Mol C.D. Shen B. Tainer J.A. Cell. 1998; 95: 135-146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 33Hwang K.Y. Baek K. Kim H.-Y. Cho Y. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 707-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). In this report, we focused on the first five residues (Arg-29, Arg-47, Arg-70, Arg-73, and Lys-80) and determined that Arg-47 and Arg-70 are important for the interaction with the DNA substrates. Arg-70 might interact with the upstream double-stranded region of the DNA substrates, and Arg-47, possibly interacting with the upstream template region of DNA substrate, was revealed to play a role in determining cleavage sites via mutational analysis, biochemical assays, protonation, and competition experiments. All mutant proteins created for this study were prepared using the QuikChangeTM site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). Mutagenic primers were synthesized at the City of Hope DNA/RNA/peptide synthesis core facility. Mutations and corresponding oligo sequences for primers are listed in TableII for clarity. Site-directed mutagenesis, overexpression, and purification of the wild type and mutant FEN-1 and Rad27 proteins were carried out based on our previously published procedures (15Qiu J., Li, X.

Bold sequences indicate codon changes. Open table in a new tab F, forward; R, reverse; exo-, exonuclease. Bold sequences indicate codon changes. The oligos used to formulate nuclease substrates are also listed in Table II. Protocols for DNA substrate preparation and nuclease activity assays were based on a previous publication (34Frank G. Qiu J. Somsouk M. Weng Y. Somsouk L. Nolan J. Shen B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33064-33072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Briefly, Flap-G1 (labeled oligo of the flap substrate), Flap-ND (labeled oligo for single flap substrate and double flap substrate), or Exo-3PT (labeled oligo of exonuclease substrate) were individually phosphorylated at the 5′ end. This was done by incubating 40 pmol of the oligo with 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and 1 μl (10 units/μl) of polynucleotide kinase at 37 °C for 60 min. Polynucleotide kinase was then inactivated by heating at 72 °C for 10 min. 80 pmol each of the Temp-3B and Prim-1G oligos were added to the labeled oligos, respectively. The samples were incubated at 70 °C for 5 min followed by slow cooling to 25 °C, allowing the oligos to slowly anneal and form the flap endonuclease and exonuclease substrates as shown in Fig. 2, B and C. Substrates were precipitated at −20 °C overnight after adding 20 μl of 3 m NaOAc and 1 ml of 100% ethanol. Substrates were collected by centrifugation, washed once with 70% ethanol, and resuspended in sterile water. Reactions were carried out with the amount of hFEN-1 protein as indicated and 500 fmol of flap or exonuclease substrate with reaction buffer containing 50 mm Tris (pH 8.0) 10 mmMgCl2, and 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin. Each reaction was then brought to a total volume of 13 μl with water. All reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 15 min and terminated by adding an equal volume of stop solution (95% formamide, 20 mm EDTA, 0.05% bromphenol blue, and 0.05% xylene cyanol). An aliquot of each reaction was then run on a 12% denaturing polyacrylamide gel at 1900 V for 1 h. The gel was dried at 70 °C for 50 min and then visualized by autoradiography. FEN-1 cleavage kinetics were performed using various concentrations of DNA substrates (31.25–500 nm) and constant amounts of FEN-1 (92 nm) following the procedures described in Hosfield et al. (35Hosfield D.J. Frank G. Weng Y. Tainer J.A. Shen B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27154-27161Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Briefly, reactions were initiated by combining standard reaction buffer, substrate, and enzyme in that order. Samples were mixed and incubated for 10 min. The products and substrate were separated by denaturing gel electrophoresis. The initial velocity was calculated by measuring products and substrate intensity on the gel by using the IP Lab Gel program and by using the equation ν = {I 1/(I 0+0.5I 1)t} × [substrate], where t = time in seconds, I 1 = product intensity, and I 0 = final substrate concentration. The substrate concentration was expressed in nm. V max and K m values were calculated by directly fitting the data to the Michaelis-Menten equation, and k cat andk cat/K m were then derived. The experiment was based on a constant amount of wild type protein with various concentrations of each mutant protein. Three mutants were used for this analysis, including D181A, R47A/D181A, and R70A/D181A. A plasmid overexpressing the D181A mutant gene (D181A/pET) was constructed previously (38Shen B. Nolan J.P. Sklar L.A. Park M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9173-9176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Based on this plasmid, two other mutants, R47A/D181A and R70A/D181A, were constructed, overexpressed, and purified. The competition assay was conducted with standard reaction buffer and32P-labeled substrates as described above. The amount of wild type hFEN-1 and mutant proteins are as specified in the Fig. 3legend. After a 15-min incubation at 30 °C, the reaction was stopped with stop solution. The products and substrate were separated by 10% denaturing PAGE to assess the substrate binding capacity of the mutants. This assay was conducted using immobilized substrates on beads and based on a method modified from Gomes and Burgers (39Gomes X.V. Burgers P.M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3811-3821Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 nm Temp-1G with biotin at the 5′ end (5′-Biotin-GGACTCTGCCTCAAGACGGTAGTCAACGTG-3′) (Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc., Coralville, IA) was annealed to 1.5 nm Prim-3B (5′-CACGTTGACTACCGTC-3′) and 1.5 nm Flap-G1 (5′-GATGTCAAGCAGTCCTAACTTTGAGGCAGAGTCC-3′) for flap substrate or Exo-3PT (5′-TTGAGGCAGAGTCC-3′) for exonuclease substrate. The annealed flap endo- or exonuclease substrate was immobilized to the NeutrAvidinTM beads in buffer A (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, and 1m NaCl) by incubation for 2–3 h at room temperature. The unbound substrate was washed off with buffer A. The bead-bound substrate was resuspended in buffer C (30 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.5, 125 mm NaCl, 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 1 mm dithiothreitol). The binding assay was performed on ice for 20 min in a 16-μl reaction volume in buffer C with addition of 8 μl of substrate-bound beads and the amount of protein as indicated in the Fig. 4 legend. The beads were then washed twice with prechilled buffer B (30 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.5, 5% glycerol, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 125 mm NaCl). 12 μl of 2× protein sample loading buffer was then added. The reaction mixture was boiled for 5 min to release the FEN-1 protein from the beads. After a 2-min centrifugation at 14,000 rpm, the supernatant was loaded onto the 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The proteins were blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell) using a Trans-Blot SD semidry electrophoretic transfer cell from Bio-Rad. The blot was probed with polyclonal antibodies raised in rabbits against hFEN-1 (36Qiu J. Qian Y. Frank P. Wintersberger U. Shen B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8361-8371Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). A specific FEN-1 protein was detected using the Pierce SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescence kit and a protocol recommended by the manufacturer. Since a three-dimensional crystal structure of human FEN-1 has not been solved, we constructed a molecular model of hFEN-1 using the archaebacterial structures. Based on that model of hFEN-1 (Fig. 1), five residues including Arg-29, Arg-47, Arg-70, Arg-73, and Arg-80 were visualized on the surface of the molecule near the catalytic center. To experimentally test the roles of these amino acid residues in substrate binding and nuclease activity, we created the following non-conservative amino acid substitution mutants: R29A, R47A, R70A, R73A, R80A, R47A/R70A, and R70A/R73A. The mutant proteins were overexpressed and purified to photographic homogeneity as shown in Fig.2 A. These proteins were then assayed for their FEN-1 activities. Fig. 2, B andC, shows that only R47A or R70A among the five single mutants had a significant effect on FEN-1 enzyme activities. Subsequently R47A, R70A, R73A (as a control since it is so close to Arg-70), R47A/R70A, and R70A/R73A were included for further investigations. The R47A and R70A mutants had a more severe impact on exonuclease rather than on flap endonuclease activity. R70A significantly reduced exonuclease activity while retaining most of its flap endonuclease activity (Table III). In contrast, the R47A mutation maintained both activities but shifted the endonuclease cleavage site from nucleotide position 19 (Pos19) to 21 (Pos21) on the flap strand and the exonuclease cleavage site from Pos1, Pos2, and Pos3 to Pos2 and Pos3. Double mutants R47A/R70A and R70A/R73A failed to show a synergistic effect on nuclease activities. In fact, the combined mutational effect of R47A and R70A as well as R70A and R73A was additive (Fig. 2, B and C).Table IIIKinetic parameters of wild type and mutant FEN-1 proteinsProteinsEnzyme activity K m k cat k cat/K m nm (1/min) × 10 −2 (1/nm·min) × 10 −4wtFEN-145.23.57.7R47A76.33.14.1R70AEndo-101.22.62.6R73A47.53.67.6R47A/R70A111.82.52.2R70A/R73A106.72.72.5wtFEN-156.22.54.4R47A74.71.62.1R70AExo-ND3-aND, the relevant parameters were unmeasurable due to the impaired enzyme activity.NDNDR73A55.62.64.7R47A/R70ANDNDNDR70A/R73ANDNDNDwt, wild type; Endo-, endonuclease; Exo-, exonuclease.3-a ND, the relevant parameters were unmeasurable due to the impaired enzyme activity. Open table in a new tab wt, wild type; Endo-, endonuclease; Exo-, exonuclease. To further explore the roles of Arg-47 and Arg-70 in substrate DNA binding, we performed kinetic analysis of the wild type and mutant hFEN-1 enzymes. Conventional steady-state kinetic analyses were carried out using various concentrations of radioactively labeled substrates, a constant amount of enzyme, and gel electrophoresis. We then measured cleavage activity with both the flap endo- and exonuclease DNA substrates. The results were analyzed using Michaelis-Menten kinetics to derive K m ,k cat, andk cat/K m values as listed in Table III. While the k cat values for flap endonuclease activity were largely not affected, K m values for the R70A, R47A/R70A, and R70A/R73A mutants were doubled. The second order rate constants (k cat/K m ) for these three mutants were significantly reduced (3-fold) with the endonuclease activity, suggesting that residue Arg-70 is critical for DNA substrate binding. Interestingly the R47A/R70A double mutant again revealed an additive effect on kinetic parameters. The effects of these mutations to the exonuclease activity were so severe that their kinetic parameters were not measurable any more. The K m of the R47A exonuclease activity was slightly increased, while thek cat and second order rate constant were both decreased. Since R47A and R70A of hFEN-1 retained partial flap endonuclease activity, they could not be directly used for the competition assays. However, our previous studies indicated that the D181A hFEN-1 mutant had a wild type or even enhanced binding capability but lost cleavage activity, and it could compete for substrates with the wild type enzyme and suppress wild type enzyme activity (38Shen B. Nolan J.P. Sklar L.A. Park M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9173-9176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The competition assay utilized in our current study has been established based on these observations. Knowing the biochemical characteristics of the D181A mutant, we created two double mutants D181A/R47A and D181A/R70A to confirm the roles of the Arg-47 and Arg-70 residues in DNA binding. Null nuclease activities of these mutants were verified before they were used in competition assays. Circular dichroism spectra of the wild type, single mutants, and double mutants were taken and compared to confirm that no significant structural alterations took place due to these mutations (data not shown). Then if Arg-47 and Arg-70 are involved in DNA binding, the double mutant proteins, R47A/D181A and R70A/D181A, should demonstrate reduced DNA substrate binding ability in contrast to the D181A mutant. The competition assays were performed based on a constant amount of wild type hFEN-1 protein and increasing amounts of mutant proteins (D181A, R47A/D181A, or R70A/D181A). The result indicates that the double mutants did in fact have a significantly reduced ability to suppress the enzyme activity of the wild type hFEN-1 protein (Fig.3, A and B). R47A/D181A had even more severe effects on substrate binding. To further examine the roles of Arg-47 and Arg-70 in substrate binding, we performed DNA-protein binding assays. This assay was conducted using biotinylated DNA substrates immobilized onto avidin-coated beads. After FEN-1 proteins were loaded onto the beads with the DNA substrates, the remaining unbound proteins were removed by extensively washing the beads. Bound protein was then dissociated by boiling and subsequently detected by Western blotting using anti-hFEN-1 antibody. The result of this experiment is shown in Fig. 4,A and B, with the flap DNA and exonuclease substrates. It is clear that R47A and R70A mutations produced significantly lower binding affinity to both of the substrates. The above data allow us to propose that the two amino acids, Arg-47 and Arg-70, are involved in DNA binding of FEN-1 protein. One further question is which parts of the DNA substrate interact with these two amino acids. We designed an experiment using five different substrates. Some of the substrates lack a part of the configuration of the normal double flap substrate. The names and different structural elements of the substrates are indicated in Fig.5. Analysis of various responses of the wild type protein and R47A and R70A mutants to the different substrates was expected to delineate the specific site of the normal substrate that interacts with these two residues. Fig. 5 Ashows the cleavage results of three FEN-1 proteins based on normal flap, pseudo Y, and 5′ overhanging substrates. The result with the normal flap substrate was consistent with those described for Fig.1 B. That is, R70A mutant had a reduction of enzyme cleavage capability but had no change of cleavage sites in comparison to the wild type; however, mutation R47A changed both cleavage efficiency and sites (a shift from Pos19 to Pos21 and larger products). With pseudo Y substrate missing the upstream primer, the enzyme activities of the wild type and the R47A and R70A mutants were reduced, particularly at the Pos21 cleavage site. With a 5′ overhanging substrate, the enzyme activities of the three FEN-1 proteins were all further reduced, and the cleavage products wer"
https://openalex.org/W1998347884,"The glucose effect on cell growth has been investigated in the JAr human choriocarcinoma cells. When JAr cells were cultured in the presence of 6 mm glucose (LG), proliferation and thymidine incorporation were induced by serum, epidermal growth factor, and insulin-like growth factor 1 but not by insulin. In contrast, at 25 mm glucose (HG), proliferation and thymidine incorporation were stimulated by insulin, serum, epidermal growth factor, and insulin-like growth factor 1 to a comparable extent, whereas basal levels were 25% lower than those in LG. HG culturing also enhanced insulin-stimulated insulin receptor and insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) tyrosine phosphorylations while decreasing basal phosphorylations. These actions of glucose were accompanied by an increase in cellular tyrosine phosphatase activity. The activity of SHP-2 in HG-treated JAr cells was 400% of that measured in LG-treated cells. SHP-2 co-precipitation with IRS1 was also increased in HG-treated cells. SHP-2 was mainly cytosolic in LG-treated cells. However, HG culturing largely redistributed SHP-2 to the internal membrane compartment, where tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS1 predominantly localizes. Further exposure to insulin rescued SHP-2 cytosolic localization, thereby preventing its interaction with IRS1. Antisense inhibition of SHP-2 reverted the effect of HG on basal and insulin-stimulated insulin receptor and IRS1 phosphorylation as well as that on thymidine incorporation. Thus, in JAr cells, glucose modulates insulin mitogenic action by modulating SHP-2 activity and intracellular localization.

In the present work, we have addressed this issue by investigating glucose regulation of insulin action in the JAr human choriocarcinoma cell line. We show that in this placenta cell model, glucose regulates insulin signaling via the IRS1/MAPK pathway and mitogenesis by modulating the activity and subcellular localization of the SHP-2 tyrosine phosphatase. JAr and BeWo cell lines were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Media and sera for cell culture were purchased from Sigma. Protein A-Sepharose beads were from Pierce.

MAPK, SHP-2, PTP1B, and LAR antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). The SHP-2 sense and antisense oligonucleotides have been described previously and characterized (23Pazdrak K. Adachi T. Alam R. J. Exp.

All of the other reagents were from Sigma. JAr, BeWo, and 3T3 cells were routinely grown at 37 °C with 95% air, 5% CO2 in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Transient transfection experiments were performed with the LipofectAMINE method according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 50–80% confluent JAr cells were washed twice with Optimem and incubated for 8 h with 10 μg of SHP-2 antisense oligonucleotides or with an equal amount of control oligonucleotides. The medium was replaced with DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, and the cells were further incubated for 6 h before being assayed. The cells were incubated in Hepes buffer containing 12.5 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 120 mm NaCl, 6 mm KCl, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mmNa2HPO4, and 20 mm Hepes, supplemented with either 6 mm or 25 mm glucose for 48 h. Insulin (100 nm) was then added in the last 10 min of incubation, where indicated. The cells were washed two times with Hepes buffer and homogenized in 20 mm Hepes, 250 mm sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mmbenzamidine, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μm leupeptin, pH 7.4. Subcellular fractions were prepared by a modification of the methods of Simpson (24Simpson I.A. Yver D.R. Hissin P.J. Wardzala L.J. Karnieli E. Salans L.B. Cushman S.W. Biochim. Biophys.

Briefly, the cells were washed with ice-cold buffer A (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 255 mm sucrose, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm NaF, 100 μm Na3VO4, 1 mmNaP2O7, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, and 5 μg/ml leupeptin) and broken in ice-cold buffer A by passing through a 27-gauge needle and centrifuged at 800 × g for 5 min at 4 °C to pellet nuclei. The supernatants were centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The pellets were applied on a 1.12 m sucrose cushion and centrifuged at 212,000 × g for 70 min for preparation of the plasma membrane fraction. The supernatants were further centrifuged at 212,000 × g for 20 min for preparation of the internal membrane (pellet) and cytosol (supernatant) fractions (24Simpson I.A. Yver D.R. Hissin P.J.

For this assay, the cells were plated in 24-well plates (105 cells/well) in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS. After 12 h, the medium was substituted with glucose-free DMEM supplemented with 0.25% bovine serum albumin for 16h. The cells were then incubated in the medium supplemented with 6 mm (LG) or 25 mm (HG) glucose with or without insulin (100 nm), IGF-1 (100 nm), EGF (100 ng/ml), and FBS (10%) for the indicated times. In control experiments the cells were incubated in glucose-free DMEM containing 6 or 25 mm sucrose or fructose. 5 μCi/ml [3H]thymidine were added, and the incubation was prolonged for 4 h more. The cells were then lysed in 1n NaOH, and radioactivity was counted by liquid scintillation counting. For proliferation assay, JAr cells were plated in 24-well multiplates (2 × 104 cells/plate) in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS. 12 h later, this medium was replaced with serum-free DMEM containing 0.25% bovine serum albumin. After an additional 12 h, the medium was substituted with DMEM containing either 6 or 25 mm glucose and growth factors for the indicated times. For DNA fragmentation analysis, JAr cells were deprived of serum and glucose for 12 h and then incubated for 48 h in DMEM containing 6 or 25 mm glucose in the absence or presence of 100 nm insulin and 25 ng/ml TNFα. The cells (2 × 106) were lysed in 0.5 ml of lysis buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.6% SDS, 10 mm EDTA). The RNase solution was added to a concentration of 15 μg/ml, and the cell lysates were incubated for 20 min at 37 °C. NaCl was then added to 1m (final concentration) followed by incubation at 4 °C for 2 h. The samples were centrifuged at 14,000 ×g (4C for 30 min), and supernatant DNA was extracted by phenol-chloroform and ethanol precipitation at −20 °C overnight. Upon centrifugation at 14,000 × g, the DNA pellet was air dried and dissolved in 20 μl of 10 mm Tris, 10 mm EDTA. Identical amounts of DNA were electrophoresed on 1.5% agarose gels containing 0.5 μg/ml ethidium bromide and visualized by UV light as described in Ref. 28Donath M.Y. Gross D.J. Cerasi E. Kaiser N.

Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 8.5 × 10−5 insulin and was subtracted from the total bound radioactivity to yield the specific binding. The binding data were analyzed using the Ligand program for curve fitting and parameter estimation (30Formisano P. Sohn K.J. Miele C., Di Finizio B. Petruzziello A. Riccardi G. Beguinot L.

For IR phosphorylation studies, JAr cells were deprived of serum and glucose for 12 h and then incubated in DMEM supplemented with 6 or 25 mm glucose for 48 h. The cells were then stimulated with 100 nminsulin for 10 min and solubilized in 1% Triton X-100, 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The insoluble material was separated by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The supernatant was applied to a wheat germ agglutinin-Sepharose column pre-equilibrated with buffer containing 0.1% Triton X-100, 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mmNaCl, and the protease inhibitors described above. The column was washed using the same buffer, and bound glycoproteins were eluted in the same buffer containing 0.3 m N-acetylglucosamine. For IRS1 phosphorylation studies, the cells were lysed in 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mmNaCl, 10% glycerol, 10 mm EDTA, 10 mmNa4P2O7, 1 mmNa3VO4, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 100 mm NaF, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (TA buffer) containing 1% Triton X-100. The cell extracts were then blotted with IR, IRS1, or phosphotyrosine antibodies or precipitated with IR- and IRS1-specific antibodies followed by Western blotting with phosphotyrosine antibody as described in Ref. 32Miele C.

Alternatively, to determine protein-tyrosine phosphatase (PTPase) activity, the cells were incubated with or without 2 mm sodium vanadate in phosphate-free buffer for 20 min at 37C, according to Ref. 34Okada Y. Yoshida M. Baba S. Shii K. Diabetes Res. Clin. Pract. 1998; 41: 157-163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar. Incubation with 100 μm pervanadate instead of 2 mm vanadate yielded identical results. The cells were lysed in 0.5% Triton-X-100 and then immunoprecipitated with IR-, IRS1-, and SHP-2-specific antibodies. The pellets were resuspended in 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, and the reactions were initiated by the addition of 20 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate at 37 °C for 15 min. The reactions were stopped with 1 nNaOH, and release of p-nitrophenol was spectrophotometrically quantitated at 410 nm. PTPase (vanadate-sensitive activity) was expressed as the difference between the total phosphatase activity (measured in the absence of vanadate) and the vanadate-resistant activity. JAr cells were incubated in 6 or 25 mm glucose and stimulated with insulin as described above. The cells were then lysed with TAT buffer, and the extracts were incubated with Sepharose-bound IR or IRS1 antibodies at 4 °C for 3 h. The beads were washed with TA buffer containing 0.1% Triton X-100, and bound proteins were released by heating at 65 °C for 5 min with SDS sampling buffer (4% SDS, 10% glycerol, 100 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mmdithiothreitol, and 8 m urea). The released proteins were blotted with SHP-2, PTP1B, or LAR antibodies and revealed by ECL and autoradiography. We investigated growth factor effect on DNA synthesis in JAr cells cultured in the presence of either LG or HG. At 6 mmglucose, IGF-1 (100 nm), EGF (100 ng/ml), and FBS (10%) caused a time-dependent increase of thymidine incorporation in JAr cell nuclei (Fig. 1 A). In contrast, insulin (100 nm) had no effect in stimulating thymidine incorporation. Culturing the cells in HG caused a 25% decrease in thymidine incorporation as compared with LG (p < 0.05) (Fig. 1 C). However, in HG cells, insulin increased thymidine incorporation by 350% after 96 h of incubation (p < 0.01) (Fig. 1 B). The permissive effect of glucose on insulin-induced thymidine incorporation was time-dependent and not mimicked by either sucrose (6–25 mm) (Fig. 1, A and B) or fructose (data not shown). In addition, HG culturing of the cells induced EGF-, IGF-1-, and FBS-dependent DNA synthesis 12 h earlier compared with LG (Fig. 1, A andB). Glucose modulation of insulin action was dose-dependent (Fig. 1 D). A significant increase in insulin-stimulated thymidine incorporation became detectable upon incubation of the cells with 18 mm glucose achieving a maximum at 25 mmglucose. As with thymidine incorporation, the insulin effect on cell proliferation was only observed when the cells were cultured with HG and not with LG (Fig. 2, A andB). Also, raising glucose concentration from 6 to 25 mm decreased basal cell proliferation by 20% (p < 0.05) (Fig. 2 C). Again, no significant difference between EGF-, IGF-1-, and FBS-induced cell proliferation was observed at 6 and 25 mm glucose (Fig. 2, A andB). Thus, glucose specifically enabled insulin mitogenic effect in JAr cells and slightly reduced basal proliferation. In different cell types, glucose affects apoptosis (35Hall J.L. Matter C.M. Wang X. Gibbons G.H. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 574-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 36Federici M. Hribal M. Perego L. Ranalli M. Caradonna Z. Perego C. Usellini L. Nano R. Bonini P. Bertuzzi F.

However, no DNA laddering was observed in JAr cells cultured with LG or HG, either in the absence or in the presence of insulin (data not shown). To explore the mechanism of glucose action on insulin mitogenesis, we investigated insulin binding and early signaling events in JAr cells cultured with different glucose concentrations. Based on Western blotting with IR Ab, IR protein content was almost identical in LG- and HG-cultured JAr cells (Fig. 3 A, top panel). Binding levels and K d values also did not show significant differences in cells maintained in LG and in HG (Table I).Table I125 I-Insulin binding in JAr cellsTime K dBinding h nm %LG482.1 ± 0.1516.1 ± 1.2961.7 ± 0.2516.7 ± 1.71681.8 ± 0.2016.5 ± 1.5HG481.8 ± 0.2516.3 ± 1.3961.6 ± 0.1517.2 ± 2.01682.0 ± 0.1516.8 ± 1.6Binding experiments were performed on cells kept in the presence of LG or HG for 48, 96, and 168 h.

The data represent the means ± S.D. of triplicate determinations in three independent experiments. TheK d values were determined by Scatchard analysis of binding data as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Upon blotting with phosphotyrosine Abs, extracts of cells cultured in 6 mm glucose showed a 95-kDa band corresponding to the IR β subunit (Fig. 3 A, middle panel). The intensity of this band increased by 35% upon exposure of the cells to insulin. Cell culturing in the presence of 25 mm glucose decreased basal IR tyrosine phosphorylation by 30% compared with LG cells (p < 0.05) but resulted in a 300% increase in insulin-dependent phosphorylation (p < 0.01). Similar changes were observed by analyzing anti-phosphotyrosine blots of IR precipitates of partially purified receptor preparations from LG and HG cultured cells (Fig 3 A, bottom panel and bar graph). In contrast with the IR, neither glucose nor insulin induced any change in IGF-1 receptor phosphorylation (Fig. 3 B). IGF-1 stimulated to a comparable extent IGF-1 receptor phosphorylation in both LG- and HG-cultured cells. In addition, culturing JAr cells in the presence of LG or HG caused no change in their ability to degrade insulin (Fig.3 C). This finding suggested that the differences in insulin action observed in LG and in HG were not due to changes in the ability of the cells to degrade insulin. To further address the molecular mechanism of glucose effect on insulin action, we next investigated phosphorylation of IRS1 in the JAr cells. As shown in Fig. 4 A, insulin-independent IRS1 phosphorylation was 50% lower in HG-treated cells as compared with LG-treated cells (p < 0.05). However, insulin increased IRS1 phosphorylation by 400% of control in HG-cultured cells (p < 0.01) but elicited no significant effect in LG cells. The differences in IRS1 phosphorylation in cells cultured in LG and HG were accompanied by similarly sized differences in MAPK phosphorylation (Fig. 4 B). There were no changes in the IRS1 and MAPK protein levels in LG and HG cells (Fig4 C). We next investigated whether the glucose effect on IR and IRS1 phosphorylation is mediated by changes in cellular PTPase activity. As shown in Table II, exposure to HG increased PTPase activity in JAr cell extracts by almost 300% (p < 0.01). Insulin inhibited PTPase activity in LG cells by about 30% (not statistically significant) and almost completely abolished the effect of HG (p < 0.05). PTPase activity was also measured in IR and IRS1 immunoprecipitates from the cells. Neither glucose nor insulin affected the IR-co-precipitated PTPase, however. IN contrast, IRS1-associated PTPase activity was 350% higher in HG than in LG cells (p < 0.01) and was blocked by insulin stimulation.Table IITyrosine phosphatase (PTPase) activity in JAr cellsTotalIRIRS1LGHGLGHGLGHG−Insulin0.8 ± 0.042.3 ± 0.040.31 ± 0.0130.4 ± 0.020.6 ± 0.032.17 ± 0.37+Insulin0.6 ± 0.020.9 ± 0.020.29 ± 0.0110.39 ± 0.0230.5 ± 0.0120.8 ± 0.021PTPase activity was measured from total cell lysates (50 μg of protein) and from IR and IRS1 precipitates (500 μg of proteins, as determined before the immunoprecipitation) usingp-nitrophenylphosphate as substrate.

To verify whether specific PTPase(s) are involved in glucose regulation of IR signaling, we evaluated the expression of SHP-2, PTP1B, and LAR in JAr cells. All of these PTPases are involved in insulin signaling (37Khune M.R. Pawson T. Lienhard G.E. Feng G.S. J. Biol.

Neither glucose nor insulin caused any change in the expression levels of these PTPases. Interestingly, in HG-cultured cell extracts but not in those from LG cells, SHP-2 co-precipitated with IRS1 (Fig. 5 B). Further exposure of HG-treated cells to insulin completely abolished IRS1-SHP-2 co-precipitation. No IR-SHP-2 co-precipitation was detected either in HG or in LG cells. LAR and PTP1B association with IRS1 was barely detectable in JAr cells and was not modified by glucose or insulin treatment (Fig. 5 C). As shown in Fig. 6 B, phosphatase activity in SHP-2 immunoprecipitates was increased by 400% upon exposure of the cells to HG. Same as in the IRS1 precipitates, insulin stimulation of the cells completely inhibited PTPase activity in the SHP-2 precipitates.Figure 6Antisense inhibition of SHP-2 in JAr cells. JAr cells were transiently transfected with SHP-2 sense (S) or antisense (AS) oligonucleotides.

As shown in Fig. 6 A, the antisense reduced SHP-2 expression by >70% (p < 0.001). Consistently, SHP-2 activity was barely detectable in SHP-2 precipitates from cells transfected with SHP-2-AS but unmodified by control oligonucleotides (Fig. 6 A). Also, the SHP-2-AS completely inhibited SHP-2-IRS1 co-precipitation in extracts from HG-treated cells (Fig. 7 A,top panel). In HG-cultured cells, a block of SHP-2 expression increased insulin-independent IR and IRS1 phosphorylation, respectively, by 30 and 50% (p < 0.01). The effect of the antisense was accompanied by a 300% decrease in insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of IR and IRS1. SHP-2-AS tr"

In this study, we investigated the role of an arginine residue, which is highly conserved among the corresponding subunits of bacterial vacuolar-type ATPases, at position 573 of NtpI. Substitution of Glu, Leu, or Gln for Arg-573 abolished sodium transport and sodium-stimulated ATP hydrolysis of the enzyme. The conservative replacement of Arg by Lys lowered both activities about one-fifth of those of the wild type enzyme. We have reported previously on ATP-dependent negative cooperativity for Na+ coupling of this enzyme (Murata, T., Kakinuma, Y., and Yamato, I. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, 48337–48340). The negative cooperativity for the Na+dependence of ATPase activity was weakened by the mutation R573K; the Hill coefficients for the wild type and mutant enzymes at a saturated ATP concentration were 0.22 ± 0.03 and 0.40 ± 0.05, respectively. The Hill coefficients of both enzymes at limited ATP concentrations approached 1. These results indicate that NtpI Arg-573 is indispensable for sodium translocation and for the cooperative features of E. hirae vacuolar-type ATPase.

We have identified a variant of V-ATPase in Enterococcus hirae, which characteristically transports Na+ or Li+ (4Kakinuma Y. Igarashi K. FEBS Lett. 1990; 271: 97-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). V-ATPase is composed of two structural domains: the hydrophilic/catalytic V1portion and membrane-embedded/ion-translocating V0 portion. In E. hirae V-ATPase, the V1 portion consists of seven subunits (Ntp-A, -B, -C, -D, -E, -F, -G) and V0 two subunits (NtpI and NtpK proteolipid) of molecular masses 76 and 16 kDa, respectively (5Kakinuma Y.

Kakinuma Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11037-11044Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). V-ATPase thus structurally resembles F-ATPase, which functions as an ATP synthase in mitochondria, chloroplasts, and oxidative bacteria (7Senior A.E. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Chem. 1990; 19: 7-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar), and it is widely accepted that the molecular mechanisms of these two ATPases are fundamentally similar (2Nelson N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1100: 109-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 8Dimroth P. Wang H. Grabe M. Oster G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4924-4929Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). In the “rotation catalysis” mechanism of F-ATPase (9Boyer P.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 717-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (1595) Google Scholar), the energy of ATP hydrolysis is converted into the physical force of rotation of the γ subunit, with three ATP being hydrolyzed per rotation (10Noji H. Yasuda R. Yoshida M. Kinosita K., Jr. Nature. 1997; 386: 299-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (1966) Google Scholar). In the F0 portion, it is believed that a rotor ring consisting of c subunits rotates with the γ subunit relative to subunit a, and this rotation couples to proton translocation during ATP synthesis/hydrolysis by F-ATPase (8Dimroth P. Wang H. Grabe M. Oster G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4924-4929Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 11Fillingame R.H. Jiang W. Dmitriev O.Y. J. Exp.

In Escherichia coli F-ATPase, there is an arginine residue (Arg-210) that plays a key role in ATP-coupled proton translocation in the fourth transmembrane helix of subunit a. This arginine residue is thought to interact with Asp-61, the proton binding site, in helix 2 of subunit c (8Dimroth P. Wang H. Grabe M. Oster G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4924-4929Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 11Fillingame R.H. Jiang W. Dmitriev O.Y. J. Exp. Biol. 2000; 203: 9-17Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Vik S.B. Antonio B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30364-30369Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the E. hirae V0portion, ATP-coupled sodium translocation must be catalyzed by the NtpI subunit, which is considered to play the same role as subunit a in F-ATPase, together with six NtpK proteolipids, each having one Na+ binding site (15Murata T. Igarashi K. Kakinuma Y. Yamato I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13415-13419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Although E. hirae NtpI shows no obvious homology to F-ATPase subunit a, there is an arginine residue (Arg-573) that is conserved among the corresponding subunits of bacterial V-ATPases, in the putative sixth transmembrane segment of NtpI. We expect Arg-573 to interact with Glu-139, the Na+binding site in the fourth transmembrane segment of NtpK (16Takase K. Yamato I. Igarashi K. Kakinuma Y. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 1999; 63: 1125-1129Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), in sodium translocation. In this study, we report the effect of Arg-573 mutation on Na+-ATPase activity and found the contribution of NtpI Arg-573 to sodium translocation by E. hirae V-ATPase. The E. hiraestrains used were ATCC 9790 (wild type), obtained from the American Type Culture Collection, Nak1 (nonsense mutant of the ntpAgene) (17Kakinuma Y. Igarashi K. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 1732-1735Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the ntpI-deleted strain NID (ntpI::CAT) (18Takase, K., Murata, T., Yamato, I., Igarashi, K., and Kakinuma, Y. (1998) Abstracts of the 71st Annual Meeting of the Japan Biochemical Society Nagoya, Japan, October 14–17, 1998, p. 1099Google Scholar). Cells were grown at 37 °C in a standard complex medium, NaTY (1% Bacto tryptone, 0.5% Bacto yeast extract, 1% glucose, and 0.85% Na2HPO4) (19Kakinuma Y. Harold F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 2086-2091Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When necessary, Na2CO3 was added to this medium to adjust its pH to the appropriate alkaline pH. Replacement of Arg-573 by other amino acids was performed on the wild type ntpI gene in the shuttle vector pHEex (16Takase K. Yamato I. Igarashi K. Kakinuma Y. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 1999; 63: 1125-1129Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), containing the erythromycin resistance gene as marker (pHEexI), using a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The oligonucleotide primers used were the following, with substitutions underlined: R573E, 5′-CAGCTATACAGAACTAATGGCACTG-3′; R573K, 5′-GTCAGCTATACAAAACTAATGGCACTGGGAATCTCTGG-3′; R573L, 5′-CAGCTATACATTACTAATGGCACTG-3′; and R573Q, 5′-GTCAGCTATACACAACTAATGGCACTGGGAATCTCTGG-3′. Mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing, using Seq4 × 4 personal sequencing system (Amersham Biosciences), and the mutated fragments were then subcloned back into the vector pHEex. No other mutation was detected in the final products. The plasmids were introduced into strain NID, and the transformants were selected in medium containing 5 μg/ml chloramphenicol and 10 μg/ml erythromycin. PCR was performed with pHEexI as the template, using primer 1 (5′-GCTTGGCAATGGATCCTGCTTGGTATCATTCTG-3′) and primer 2 (5′-GCCGGAATTCCTAATGATGATGATGATGATGTTTTTTCTTATGATTGATGTTGACG-3′), resulting in the addition of six histidine residues to the carboxyl terminus of the ntpI gene product (underlined). Primer 1 and primer 2 contain the sequences for the restriction sites of BamHI and EcoRI (italics), respectively. The amplified DNA was digested by these enzymes and then inserted into these sites on pHEexI (pHEexI-His). For construction of His-tagged NtpIs containing Arg-573 mutation, pHEexI-His was used as the template, and mutations were introduced by the procedure described above. The nucleotide sequences of final products were verified by direct sequencing. The release of radioactive orthophosphate from [γ-32P]ATP (30–100 MBq/μmol, Institute of Isotopes Co. Ltd., Hungary) was monitored using the procedure described by Lill et al. (20Lill R. Cunningham K. Brundage L.A. Ito K. Oliver D. Wickner W. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 961-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. The reactions were performed in 20 mmTris-HCl (pH 8.8) with various concentrations of Mg2+-[γ-32P]ATP and 0.01 mg of membrane vesicle protein. To inhibit the F-ATPase but not the V-ATPase, DCC-pretreated membrane in the presence of 25 mmNaCl was used for the assay. Radioactivity in the organic phase containing the orthophosphate-molybdate complex was measured by a liquid scintillation counter. Under these experimental conditions, 5 μm Na+ was always present as a contaminant. Cells were grown overnight in high Na+ medium to induce Na+-ATPase (19Kakinuma Y. Harold F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 2086-2091Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and washed cells were suspended in 50 mm Na+-CHES (pH 10) containing 200 mm KCl at 1.0 mg of protein/ml. After the addition of 20 μm valinomycin and 20 μm CCCP, Na+ extrusion was initiated by adding 10 mm glucose. At intervals, 0.2-ml aliquots were filtered through membrane filters (pore size, 0.4 μm; Nucleopore Polycarbonate Membrane, Whatman) and washed twice with 2 mmMgSO4. The cellular sodium content was determined by flame photometry after extraction from the trapped cells with hot 5% trichloroacetic acid. The membrane vesicles were prepared from ATCC 9790 and mutants by rupture of cells using a French press (21Heefner D.L. Kobayashi H. Harold F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 11403-11407Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); if necessary, they were dialyzed overnight in the presence of EDTA as described previously (22Kakinuma Y. Igarashi K. FEBS Lett. 1990; 271: 102-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The dialyzed membranes were collected by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 60 min. The precipitate was suspended in a buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 3 mm MgSO4, 1 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 10 μm FUT175 (pH 7.5) (23Nakayama T. Taira S. Ikeda M. Ashizawa H. Oda M. Arakawa K. Fujii S. Chem. Pharm. Bull. (Tokyo). 1993; 41: 117-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) and was used for reconstitution experiments as the stripped membranes. The supernatant (EDTA extract) of dialyzed Nak1 membranes, which did not contain V1 portion but F1 portion, was used for reconstitution experiments. Reconstitution of the F0F1-ATPase was performed as described previously with some modifications (22Kakinuma Y. Igarashi K. FEBS Lett. 1990; 271: 102-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Briefly, 3 mg of the stripped membranes of ATCC 9790 or mutants was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min in 1 ml of buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 3 mmMgSO4, 10 μm FUT175, 1 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol (pH 7.5)) with 4.5 mg of the EDTA extract of Nak1. The reconstituted membranes were subsequently collected by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 60 min and suspended in the same buffer. 22Na+ uptake by reconstituted membrane vesicles was measured by the method of Waseret al. (24Waser M. Hess-Bienz D. Davies K. Solioz M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5396-5400Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Vesicles were washed and suspended in the assay buffer (0.2 M KOH maleate, 5 mmMgSO4, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10 μm FUT175, 10% glycerol (pH 7.5)). The buffer was supplemented with 10 μm22NaCl (10 GBq/nmol) and 5 mm Mg2+-ATP, incubated at room temperature, and uptake was initiated by addition of 0.2 mg/ml vesicles. 0.2-ml aliquots were filtered through Cellulose nitrate filters (pore size 0.45 μm, ADVANTEC, Tokyo) and washed once with 3 ml of the same buffer. Radioactivity on the filters was determined by a γ-scintillation counter (Aloka, Tokyo). Where indicated, 20 μm CCCP was added to the reaction mixture. 0.10 mg of the membrane vesicles prepared as described previously (19Kakinuma Y. Harold F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 2086-2091Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were suspended in 0.4 ml of the extraction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 5 mmMgCl 2 , 20 μm FUT175, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10 mm imidazole (pH 7.5)). Na+-ATPase containing His-tagged NtpI was solubilized by incubating the vesicles with 2.5% n-dodecyla-d-maltoside (Calbiochem-Novabiochem) for 10 min at room temperature, and recovered in the supernatant after centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C (25Murata T. Takase K. Yamato I. Igarashi K. Kakinuma Y. J. Biochem. 1999; 125: 414-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The supernatant was mixed with 0.4 ml of Ni-NTA resin that had been equilibrated with the extraction buffer. The mixture was incubated with agitation for 45 min at room temperature, and centrifuged for 30 s at 16,000 × g. The resin was washed three times with 1 ml of the wash buffer, consisting of equal volumes of extraction buffer and 0.2 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), and then incubated at room temperature for 5 min with 0.25 ml of the elution buffer (extraction buffer containing 1 m imidazole). After centrifugation for 30 s, the supernatant containing purified Na+-ATPase (about 0.01 mg) was collected and stored at – 80 °C (26Long J.C. Wang S. Vik S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16235-16240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Protein content was determined by the method of Lowry et al. (27Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as the standard. SDS-PAGE was conducted following Laemmli's method (28Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207227) Google Scholar). Western blotting was performed as described previously (29Nielsen P.J. Manchester K.L. Towbin H. Gordon J. Thomas G. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 12316-12321Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and visualization was carried out using anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to alkaline phosphatase. All reagents used in this study were of analytical grade. The 76-kDa NtpI protein is composed of two regions: a hydrophilic amino-terminal half and a hydrophobic carboxyl-terminal half (6Takase K. Kakinuma S. Yamato I. Konishi K. Igarashi K. Kakinuma Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11037-11044Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although the membrane topology of NtpI has not yet been determined, we consider a model with seven-transmembrane helices, according to several hydropathy analyses. V-ATPases distribute in several bacteria, and the carboxyl-terminal hydrophobic regions of their NtpI subunits are highly conserved (30Ferretti J.J. McShan W.M. Ajdic D. Savic D.J. Savic G. Lyon K.

Fig. 1 Ashows the alignment of amino acid sequences in the putative last two transmembrane segments of the NtpI homologs. This region contains three arginine residues, and one of them (E. hirae Arg-573) exists in the putative sixth transmembrane segment. Because this arginine residue is considered to correspond to the essential arginine residue of F-ATPase subunit a (Fig. 1 B) (8Dimroth P. Wang H. Grabe M. Oster G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1994; 269: 30364-30369Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), Arg-573 may well participate in Na+ translocation of this V-ATPase. First, the effects of Arg-573 mutations on cell growth were examined. V-ATPase is indispensable for ion homeostasis of E. hirae at alkaline pH (17Kakinuma Y. Igarashi K. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 1732-1735Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Even when the pH of the medium was shifted to 10, the parental strain 9790 grew well with nearly the same growth rate as that found at pH 8 (data not shown). On the other hand, the ntpI-deleted strain NID did not grow at such an alkaline pH, and it was necessary to introduce pHEexI (wild typentpI) to restore the growth of NID (TableI). Substitution of Glu, Leu, or Gln for Arg-573 did not restore the cell growth of NID at pH 10. Only the R573K mutant grew in such an alkaline medium with a slower growth rate rather than the wild type strain (Table I). The V-ATPase activities of the NtpI Arg-573 mutants were then examined. Na+-stimulated ATP hydrolytic activity was observed normally in the inverted membrane vesicles from NID/pHEexI as well as in those from parent strain 9790 but was absolutely nondetectable in those from NID/pHEex (vector). The activities were completely lost in vesicles from the mutants R573E, R573GQ, and R573L. The Na+-stimulated ATPase activity by the mutant R573K was partially observed (Table I).Table IEffect of NtpI Arg-573 mutation on growth rate and Na + ATPase activity of membrane vesiclesArg-573 mutationGrowth rate1-aGrowth rates were determined between the optical densities of 0.1 and 0.2, in NaTY medium (pH 10).

Open table in a new tab To assess whether the introduced mutations caused destabilization of the V-ATPase complex, Western blotting using antisera against NtpI polypeptide or purified V1 portion was first performed (Fig. 2 A). The expression of the NtpI subunit and those of subunits A and B, the major subunits of the V1 portion, were almost similar to those of the wild type strain (Fig. 2 A, lanes 3–6). To confirm that the V-ATPase complex containing Arg-573 mutation was assembled normally, we attempted to purify the entire V0V1 complex with the His-tagged mutated NtpI using Ni-NTA resin. The Na+-ATPase containing His-tagged NtpI was functional in both Na+ extrusion and Na+-stimulated ATPase activity. Although some unrelated protein bands were detected in the sample, all nine subunits of Na+-ATPase were detected by SDS-PAGE in the case of the wild type NtpI (Fig. 2 B, lane 2), whereas no V-ATPase subunits were detected in the case of NID/pHEex (vector) (Fig.2 B, lane 1). All other Arg-573 mutants showed the patterns in SDS-PAGE that were the same as that of the wild type (Fig.2 B, lanes 3–6). Furthermore, Western blotting revealed that the amount of NtpI in each ATPase complex was similar among the wild type and Arg-573 mutants (data not shown). It has been reported that R735L mutation caused destabilization of yeast V-ATPase complex (35Kawasaki-Nishi S. Nishi T. Forgac M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12397-12402Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). However, in the case of E. hiraeNa+-ATPase, Arg-573 did not affect the stability of NtpI and the assembly of the V1 portion with the V0portion. We also observed that most of the A and B subunits were recovered as membrane-bound even in the case of NID/pHEex (vector) (Fig. 2 A, lane 2, upper panel). Although this result may have interesting consequences in V-ATPase assembly, further experiments are required to determine whether membrane-bound A and B subunits observed without NtpI subunit (Fig.2 A) make up a stable V1 portion of the complex. Fig. 3 shows sodium transport activities of the Arg-573 mutants. Proton potential-independent sodium extrusion was observed in intact cells of NID/pHEexI as well as in parent strain 9790, but disappeared upon replacement of the residue by Glu, Leu, or Gln, whereas the extrusion activity of R573K mutant was partially observed. Two other arginine residues (Arg-600 and Arg-629) were identified in NtpI carboxyl-terminal domain as conserved among bacterial V-ATPases (Fig. 1 A). However, the substitution of leucine or glutamine for these residues, most likely located in the loop or carboxyl-terminal flanking region, did not affect the Na+-ATPase activity (data not shown). Therefore, we consider that NtpI Arg-573 corresponds to the essential arginine residue for ion translocation of the F-ATPase subunit a of E. coli (Arg-210) or Propionigenium modestum (Arg-227) (8Dimroth P. Wang H. Grabe M. Oster G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4924-4929Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar,13Vik S.B. Antonio B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30364-30369Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 B). Furthermore, although the similarity between the overall sequences of the E. hirae NtpI and the yeast V-ATPase 100-kDa subunit is only moderate (36Manolson M.F. Proteau D. Preston R.A. Stenbit A. Roberts B.T. Hoyt M.A. Preuss D. Mulholland J. Botstein D. Jones E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14294-14303Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the region containing the Arg-573 of NtpI has noticeable sequence similarity to the region containing the Arg-735 of the yeast 100-kDa subunit. A recent study discusses the importance of Arg-735 of the yeast 100-kDa subunit in proton translocation (35Kawasaki-Nishi S. Nishi T. Forgac M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12397-12402Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). These results suggest that NtpI Arg-573 is a critical arginine residue in ATP-coupled sodium translocation ofE. hirae V-ATPase. In E. coli F-ATPase, a mutant of essential arginine residue (R210A) completely lacked ATPase-coupled H+ transport but retained F0-mediated passive H+ transport activity (37Valiyaveetil F.I. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32635-32641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). On the other hand, it has been reported in V-ATPase that the free V0 portion has no passive proton channel activity (38Zhang J. Myers M. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9773-9778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We tested the possibility that E. hirae V0functions as a passive Na+ channel. E. hirae has two Na+ extrusion system, Na+-ATPase and Na+/H+ antiporter (24Waser M. Hess-Bienz D. Davies K. Solioz M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5396-5400Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We examined the effect of V0 on the generation of the Na+ electrochemical gradient by the antiporter. For this purpose, the membrane vesicles containing F0F1-ATPase and the free V0 portion were reconstituted with the stripped membranes (ATCC 9790, NID, or mutant R573L) and the EDTA extract of Nak1, in which the F1portion, not the V1 portion, was contained. Western blotting revealed reconstitution of F0F1-ATPase and the presence of the free V0 portion (Fig.4 A). Fig. 4 B shows22Na+ uptake by the V1-stripped, F0F1-reconstituted membrane vesicles. ATP-driven Na+ uptake, which was completely blocked by a protonophore, was observed for all of the vesicles from 9790, NID, or the mutant R573L. The accumulation level of22Na+ was equal among these vesicles (Fig.4 B), suggesting that generation of Na+ gradient by the antiporter was not affected by the presence or absence of functional V0. We think that the V0 portion of the E. hirae Na+-ATPase does not function as a passive Na+ pore. At least, the R573L mutation did not affect Na+ permeability of the V0 portion. E. hirae Na+-ATPase showed negative cooperativity (n H = 0.16 ± 0.03) for Na+ coupling in ATP hydrolysis, and the Hill coefficient (n H) increased to 1 in parallel with the decrease of ATP concentration (39Murata T. Kakinuma Y. Yamato I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48337-48340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). We interpret this feature according to an “ATP-dependent affinity change” model of the Na+ binding site. 1) At the first step of ion translocation, the ion binding site on NtpK (Glu-139) binds Na+ with a single high affinity (Kd of Na+ = 15 ± 5 μm) (15Murata T. Igarashi K. Kakinuma Y. Yamato I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13415-13419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). 2) During rotation of the NtpK rotor ring, a conformational change of NtpK is expected to occur at the interface between NtpK and NtpI, which lowers the Na+ binding affinity to release Na+ through the channel in NtpI. 3) The conformation of the binding site returns to its original high affinity state after exiting this interface. To explain the ATP concentration-dependent change of the Hill coefficient for Na+ dependence, we postulate that a certain amount of time is required for the binding site to return to the high affinity state. Thus, in a continuous catalytic process (in the presence of a high concentration of ATP), several Na+binding sites remaining at such a low affinity state bind next Na+, which is the rate-limited step at high concentration of ATP. Therefore, with a sufficient concentration of ATP, negative cooperativity is observed (39Murata T. Kakinuma Y. Yamato I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48337-48340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In this context, it is important to understand the role of Arg-573 in cooperativity for Na+coupling. Fig. 5 shows the dependence on Na+ of ATP hydrolysis by V-ATPase in membrane vesicles from wild type or the R573K mutant. The affinity for Na+ of the membrane vesicles from wild type was found to be biphasic as well as the purified enzyme (25Murata T. Takase K. Yamato I. Igarashi K. Kakinuma Y. J. Biochem. 1999; 125: 414-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 40Murata T. Takase K. Yamato I. Igarashi K. Kakinuma Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24885-24890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), and the apparentKm values for Na+, 20 ± 4 μm and 5 mm, were estimated. Fig.5 B shows the n H values at various concentrations of ATP in the range of 0.05–10 mm NaCl. At 2 mm ATP, the n H of the wild type was 0.22 ± 0.03. However, even at the same ATP concentration, the R573K mutant showed a much higher value of then H (0.40 ± 0.05), and only one apparentKm value for Na+ of 33 ± 7 μm was calculated. At limited ATP concentration (0.01–0.1 mm), the n H values of both enzymes increased to near 1 (Fig. 5 B). TheKm values for ATP at 25 mmNa+ (steady-state) were 0.7 mm for the wild type and 0.8 mm for the mutant (data not shown), indicating that the Arg-573 mutation did not affect the affinity for ATP. We suspect that the effects of the mutation on Na+ binding at NtpK are probably insignificant, given the lowKm value (high affinity) for Na+ in ATP hydrolysis of the mutant. And the experiments showed that the cooperativity for Na+ coupling of this enzyme was weakened by substitution of R573K. Then according to the ATP-dependent affinity change model, the effect of R573K mutation is interpreted to slow down the rotation of the NtpK rotor, providing enough time to enable the binding sites to return to their original high affinity state. In the mechanism of ATP-driven ion transport by F-ATPase, Osteret al. (41Oster G. Wang H. Grabe M. Phil. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 2000; 355: 523-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) hypothesized that the stator positive charge (Arg-210 of E. coli or Arg-227 of P. modestum) is critically required to promote ion translocation. Our results indicate that Arg-573 is a functionally indispensable residue of NtpI stator in Na+ translocation, probably by affecting the rotation of the NtpK rotor. We thank T.

As expected, we obtained the variant with the highest activity (relative activity is 21.3% of the native enzyme, named as drAsp017) by in vitro selection. The molecular weight of this variant, obtained from size-exclusion column chromatography, is about 81 kDa, which indicates that it is indeed a monomer, whereas native l-aspartase is a tetramer. The activity-reversibility of drAsp017 (10−7m) was 80% after incubation for 30 min at 50 °C, while native enzyme only retained about 17% under the same conditions. Reactivation of drAsp017 denatured in 4m guanidine HCl was independent of protein concentration at up to 20 × 10−8m at 25 °C, whereas the protein concentration of native enzyme strongly affected its reactivation under the above conditions. The sensitivity of drAsp017 (10−7m) to effective factors in the fumarate-amination reaction compared with native enzyme was also determined. Half-saturating concentrations of the activatorl-aspartate and Mg2+ for drAsp017 (0.8 and 0.5 mm, respectively) are much higher than that of the native enzyme (0.10 and 0.15 mm, respectively). The data show that a monomeric l-aspartase is obtained by in vitroselection. Thus, the conversion of oligomeric proteins into their functional monomers could have important applications.

Thus, the conversion of oligomeric proteins into their functional monomers could have important applications. 3-{[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]amino}-1-propanesulfonic acid l-Aspartase (l-aspartate ammonia-lyase, EC4.3.1.1) catalyzes the reversible conversion of l-aspartate to fumarate and NH4+ (1Zhang H.Y. Zhang J. Lin L., Du, W.Y. Lu J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 192: 15-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). l-Aspartase fromEscherichia coli W is composed of four identical subunits that are arranged with the point symmetry P212121 (2Shi W. Dunbar J. Jayasekera M.M. Viola R.E. Farber G.K. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 9136-9144Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The monosubunit of native l-aspartase has no catalytic function (3Imaishi H. Yumoto M. Tokushige M. Physiol. Chem. Phys. Med. NMR. 1989; 21: 221-228PubMed Google Scholar). Each subunit consists of three domains oriented in an elongated S-shape: D1, D2, and D3 (see Fig. 1 a). The central domain (D2), containing more than half of the total residues, is the most conserved domain in the aspartase-fumatase structural family. The central core of D2 is made up of five long helices, which are all slightly bent and are nearly parallel to each other. In maintaining the active conformation, it is important to account for most of the intersubunit contacts in l-aspartase; the five-helix bundles of D2 from four subunits form a stable structure (a 20-helix cluster) in the tetramer (4Jayasekera M.M. Shi W. Farber G.K. Viola R.E. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 9145-9150Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1 b).l-Aspartase is an important enzyme used in industry. However, the practical application for l-aspartase in aspartate synthesis has been limited, mostly due to its relatively poor stability (5Wang L.J. Kong X.D. Zhang H.Y. Wang X.P. Zhang J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 276: 346-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). As a tetramer protein, l-aspartase dissociates easily under industrial production conditions, and this is accompanied by the loss of its catalytic activity. In the presence of 0.4 m guanidine HCl, 45% of the native activity was observed when the l-aspartase tetramer had been reversibly dissociated into dimer. Fluorescence and CD studies show that only a small change occurred in the secondary and tertiary structures of the dimer compared with the native tetramer (6Murase S. Kawata Y. Yumoto N. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1993; 114: 393-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). These results indicate that the dimer of the l-aspartase subunit possesses the spatial structure of an active site(s), although not as perfect as the tetramer. Most likely, the reverse arrangement of the two subunits determines the proximity of D1 and D3 to each other in space, forming an active site between the cleft of D1 and D3 between different subunits. If so, by mimicking part of the spatial structure of the dimer of the l-aspartase subunit, the central ten-helix bundle, and an “active site” as above, we designed thel-aspartase variants, D1D2 and D2D3, which were ligated by a hexapeptide loop to form a monomer while maintaining the active site in the native dimer of the l-aspartase subunit. The most appropriate method is randomization of the inserted sequence between D1D2 and D2D3, followed by in vitro selection forl-aspartase activity (7MacBeath G. Kast P. Hilvert D.

We selected the variant with the highest activity (relative activity is 21.3% of the native enzyme, drAsp017) from a combinatorial library. The molecular mass of this variant is about 81 kDa, as determined by size-exclusion chromatography, which indicates that it is indeed a monomer. Furthermore, this monomer properties that are more suitable for applications in industry than does the native enzyme.RESULTSAt the genetic level, the genes of D1D2 (gD1D2) and D2D3 (gD2D3), respectively, were obtained by PCR amplification with two pairs of primers that were designed to introduce a random sequence into the genes (see Fig.2 a).

Withoutl-aspartase activity, JGR1476 cells grow very slowly in the selection medium that contains l-aspartate as the sole nitrogen source (Asp-N selection medium) (5Wang L.J. Kong X.D. Zhang H.Y. Wang X.P. Zhang J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 276: 346-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The considerable growth of some clones on the Asp-N selection agar plates indicates that plasmids encoding functional drAsp variants were introduced into these cells. The diameters of colonies are positively related to thel-aspartase activity of the drAsp variants expressed in the cells. From thousands of colonies, 23 clones were selected, of diameters larger than 1 mm from a selection agar plate at 37 °C for 36 h at various pH values (pH 6.5–8.5). To determine the oligomeric states of the proteins, we transferred the pool of selected genes to the T7-based expression vector pET-22b(+) (Novagen) and isolated individual clones for further analysis. His6-tagged proteins were purified by affinity chromatography, and their molecular weights were determined by size-exclusion column chromatography on a Sephadex G-150 column (0.8 × 90 cm). All 23 selected drAsp variants eluted from the gel filtration column as single peak and had lower apparent molecular weights than the theoretical dimer. 18 of the selected variants showed evidence that they were mixtures of monomeric and dimeric species, since the ratio of the observed molecular weight to that calculated from the amino acid sequence varied from 1.20 to 1.60. This situation indicated that the 18 variants could not form stable dimers, although they aggregated in a certain extent, and there were rapid equilibria between the monomers and dimers. Differing from this pattern, the other five selected proteins eluted from the size-exclusion column with retention times expected for monomeric species. Their molecular masses were about 81 kDa (Fig. 3 shows the elution curve of drAsp017 as an example).Figure 3drAsp017 was eluted at a monomeric molecular weight from a G-150 filtration column. The following proteins were selected as standards to calibrate the column (molecular weight given in parentheses): tyrosinase (140,000), bovine serum albumin (67,000), ovalbumin (45,000), and chymotrypsinogen A (25,000).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The corresponding genes of the monomeric drAsp variants were sequenced (Table I). The inserted hexapeptides were EYTDKT, DSGISH, YPDTGG, TLPGNK, and VSGSGN, respectively. The secondary structure of the monomeric variants were predicted by the GOR I method (28Garnier J. Gibrat J.F.

The presence of the appropriate turn between D1D2 and D2D3 may be necessary for yielding monomeric proteins with catalytic activity. However, as a result of disruption of the quarternary structure and diminution of the active sites, the relative activities of these monomeric variants were all reduced significantly, compared with the native l-aspartase (k cat = 180 s−1,K m = 1.2 × 10−3m) under the standard assay conditions.Table IKinetic parameters of drAspsdrAsp variantsSequence between D1D2 and D2D3 k cat K m k cat/K mRelative activity (presume the reactivity of the native enzyme is 100) s −1m s −1 · m −1drAsp003EYTDKT29.71.7 × 10−31.7 × 10411.3drAsp005DSGISH25.01.8 × 10−31.4 × 1049.3drAsp006YPDTGG28.41.5 × 10−31.9 × 10412.7drAsp017TLPGNK41.41.4 × 10−33.2 × 10421.3drAsp021VSGSGN39.51.9 × 10−32.1 × 10414.0 Open table in a new tab We selected the mutant enzyme with the highest activity from a combinatorial library, which we termed drAsp017, to examine in detail. As expected for a monomeric enzyme, the activity-reversibility of drAsp017 is higher than that of the native l-aspartase. For example, after being incubated for 30 min at 50 °C, the native enzyme conserved about 17% of its activity, while drAsp017 retained about 80% of that (see Fig. 4).Figure 4The activity-reversibility of nativel-aspartase (■) and drAsp017 (▪).

The results are shown in Fig.5, which indicate that the reactivation of the native enzyme is a function of protein concentration up to 20 mm, and thereafter it gradually decreases as the protein concentration increases. In contrast the protein concentration of drAsp017 did not significantly affect its reactivation because it is a monomeric enzyme.

The higher pH form of l-aspartase has an absolute requirement for l-aspartate and divalent metal ions, while the lower pH form does not require any effectors for catalytic activity (29Karsten W.E. Viola R.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 287: 60-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The high pH form of the enzyme appears to be inactive unless l-aspartate and divalent metal ions are bound to the activator site. To determine whether the activator site in drAsp017 was changed, we examined the sensitivity to effectors of drAsp017 in the fumarate-amination reaction, compared with the native enzyme. The activating effects of l-aspartate (see Fig.6 a) and Mg2+ ions (see Fig. 6 b) were observed, respectively. The half-saturating concentrations of the activator l-aspartate and Mg2+ for drAsp017 (0.8 and 0.5 mm, respectively) are much higher than that for the native enzyme (0.10 and 0.15 mm, respectively). The results indicate that the activator site of drAsp017 was partially destroyed, and its affinity for l-aspartate and Mg2+ was decreased considerably.Figure 6The activating effects ofl-aspartase (a) and Mg2+ ions (b) (fumarate-amination reaction). The assay mixture in a contained the indicated concentration ofl-aspartase. The concentration of Mg2+ ions was 5 mm because of drAsp017's high half-saturating concentration. The assay mixture in b contained 7 mm l-aspartase and the indicated concentration of Mg2+ ions. ■, native l-aspartase; ▪, drAsp017.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)DISCUSSIONIn this study, we considered that the conversion of thel-aspartase tetramer into its functional monomer would be facilitated by in vitro selection. We identified the intersubunit contacts that were required for l-aspartase activity and designed an l-aspartase variant in which D1D2 and D2D3 were ligated to form a stably folded monomer. One of the active sites was retained from the native l-aspartase by mimicking the spatial structure of its dimer. Through a systematic structure-based analysis, we changed the domain sequence ofl-aspartase from D1D2D3 to D1D2D2D3 by duplicating the central domain and introducing a random hexapeptide between the repeated D2 units. In fact, the loop was substituted for D1 and D3 from different subunits of the dimer of the l-aspartase subunit (see Fig. 7 a). Generally, protein domains are the smallest functional and folding elements and often serve as modules (30Braisted A.C. Wells J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5688-5692Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Therefore, the domains in the artificial domain-rearranged l-aspartase (drAsp) variants will not alter their basic structural character. The two five-helix bundles from the repeated D2 units will interact with each other just like those from different subunits. If the inserted hexapeptide loop adopts appropriate conformation, a 180° turn could be induced that would allow D2D3 (or D1D2) to fold back and displace other subunits to form a ten-helix bundle; it is similar to the central structure inl-aspartase dimer (see Fig. 7 a). As shown in Fig. 7 c, if the interdomain contacts occur between the D1 and D3, drAsp will form one potential active site.Figure 7Schematic of the dimer of thel-aspartase subunit and drAsp (a), computer model of the dimer (b), and domain rearrangement of l-aspartase (c).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)It is not surprising that drAsp variants have diminished or no activity due to the sensitivity of catalytic efficiency to structural perturbations. However, through long range tertiary interactions, the residues inserted between the repeated D2 units can dramatically influence the potential active site, a small fraction of which will possibly be beneficial to the enzyme's catalytic activity, presumably by restoring proper interactions for folding, stability, and adjusting the spacial position and orientation of residues in the potential active site. Given the uncertainties in predicting the optimal inserted sequence with exacting conformational control required for efficient enzyme catalysis, the most appropriate method is randomization of the inserted sequence, followed by a directed selection for the activity ofl-aspartase. Since changes have occurred in the structure of drAsp variants, it is likely that some of them form monomers, without aggregation to form a 20-helix cluster structure.By mimicking the partial spatial structure of the native dimer of thel-aspartase subunit, we obtained its functional monomer. Such structure-based rational approaches to protein engineering, combined with the randomization insert sequence, have given rise to the enzyme with altered oligomeric states. Converting oligomeric proteins into their functional monomers could have important applications, since monomeric proteins do not dissociate into the non-active form and have advantages for activity-reversibility and lower immunogenicity in protein medicine (31Viola R.E. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 2000; 74: 295-341PubMed Google Scholar). The monomeric l-aspartase and the method described here may serve as model system for studying the mechanism by which oligomer proteins change to the monomeric form. l-Aspartase (l-aspartate ammonia-lyase, EC4.3.1.1) catalyzes the reversible conversion of l-aspartate to fumarate and NH4+ (1Zhang H.Y. Zhang J. Lin L., Du, W.Y. Lu J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 192: 15-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). l-Aspartase fromEscherichia coli W is composed of four identical subunits that are arranged with the point symmetry P212121 (2Shi W. Dunbar J. Jayasekera M.M. Viola R.E. Farber G.K. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 9136-9144Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The monosubunit of native l-aspartase has no catalytic function (3Imaishi H. Yumoto M. Tokushige M. Physiol. Chem. Phys. Med. NMR. 1989; 21: 221-228PubMed Google Scholar). Each subunit consists of three domains oriented in an elongated S-shape: D1, D2, and D3 (see Fig. 1 a). The central domain (D2), containing more than half of the total residues, is the most conserved domain in the aspartase-fumatase structural family. The central core of D2 is made up of five long helices, which are all slightly bent and are nearly parallel to each other. In maintaining the active conformation, it is important to account for most of the intersubunit contacts in l-aspartase; the five-helix bundles of D2 from four subunits form a stable structure (a 20-helix cluster) in the tetramer (4Jayasekera M.M. Shi W. Farber G.K. Viola R.E. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 9145-9150Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1 b). l-Aspartase is an important enzyme used in industry. However, the practical application for l-aspartase in aspartate synthesis has been limited, mostly due to its relatively poor stability (5Wang L.J. Kong X.D. Zhang H.Y. Wang X.P. Zhang J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 276: 346-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). As a tetramer protein, l-aspartase dissociates easily under industrial production conditions, and this is accompanied by the loss of its catalytic activity. In the presence of 0.4 m guanidine HCl, 45% of the native activity was observed when the l-aspartase tetramer had been reversibly dissociated into dimer. Fluorescence and CD studies show that only a small change occurred in the secondary and tertiary structures of the dimer compared with the native tetramer (6Murase S. Kawata Y. Yumoto N. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1993; 114: 393-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). These results indicate that the dimer of the l-aspartase subunit possesses the spatial structure of an active site(s), although not as perfect as the tetramer. Most likely, the reverse arrangement of the two subunits determines the proximity of D1 and D3 to each other in space, forming an active site between the cleft of D1 and D3 between different subunits. If so, by mimicking part of the spatial structure of the dimer of the l-aspartase subunit, the central ten-helix bundle, and an “active site” as above, we designed thel-aspartase variants, D1D2 and D2D3, which were ligated by a hexapeptide loop to form a monomer while maintaining the active site in the native dimer of the l-aspartase subunit. The most appropriate method is randomization of the inserted sequence between D1D2 and D2D3, followed by in vitro selection forl-aspartase activity (7MacBeath G. Kast P. Hilvert D.

We selected the variant with the highest activity (relative activity is 21.3% of the native enzyme, drAsp017) from a combinatorial library. The molecular mass of this variant is about 81 kDa, as determined by size-exclusion chromatography, which indicates that it is indeed a monomer. Furthermore, this monomer properties that are more suitable for applications in industry than does the native enzyme. RESULTSAt the genetic level, the genes of D1D2 (gD1D2) and D2D3 (gD2D3), respectively, were obtained by PCR amplification with two pairs of primers that were designed to introduce a random sequence into the genes (see Fig.2 a).

The diameters of colonies are positively related to thel-aspartase activity of the drAsp variants expressed in the cells. From thousands of colonies, 23 clones were selected, of diameters larger than 1 mm from a selection agar plate at 37 °C for 36 h at various pH values (pH 6.5–8.5). To determine the oligomeric states of the proteins, we transferred the pool of selected genes to the T7-based expression vector pET-22b(+) (Novagen) and isolated individual clones for further analysis. His6-tagged proteins were purified by affinity chromatography, and their molecular weights were determined by size-exclusion column chromatography on a Sephadex G-150 column (0.8 × 90 cm). All 23 selected drAsp variants eluted from the gel filtration column as single peak and had lower apparent molecular weights than the theoretical dimer. 18 of the selected variants showed evidence that they were mixtures of monomeric and dimeric species, since the ratio of the observed molecular weight to that calculated from the amino acid sequence varied from 1.20 to 1.60. This situation indicated that the 18 variants could not form stable dimers, although they aggregated in a certain extent, and there were rapid equilibria between the monomers and dimers. Differing from this pattern, the other five selected proteins eluted from the size-exclusion column with retention times expected for monomeric species. Their molecular masses were about 81 kDa (Fig. 3 shows the elution curve of drAsp017 as an example).Figure 3drAsp017 was eluted at a monomeric molecular weight from a G-150 filtration column. The following proteins were selected as standards to calibrate the column (molecular weight given in parentheses): tyrosinase (140,000), bovine serum albumin (67,000), ovalbumin (45,000), and chymotrypsinogen A (25,000).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The corresponding genes of the monomeric drAsp variants were sequenced (Table I).

Through a systematic structure-based analysis, we changed the domain sequence ofl-aspartase from D1D2D3 to D1D2D2D3 by duplicating the central domain and introducing a random hexapeptide between the repeated D2 units. In fact, the loop was substituted for D1 and D3 from different subunits of the dimer of the l-aspartase subunit (see Fig. 7 a). Generally, protein domains are the smallest functional and folding elements and often serve as modules (30Braisted A.C. Wells J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5688-5692Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Therefore, the domains in the artificial domain-rearranged l-aspartase (drAsp) variants will not alter their basic structural character. The two five-helix bundles from the repeated D2 units will interact with each other just like those from different subunits. If the inserted hexapeptide loop adopts appropriate conformation, a 180° turn could be induced that would allow D2D3 (or D1D2) to fold back and displace other subunits to form a ten-helix bundle; it is similar to the central structure inl-aspartase dimer (see Fig. 7 a). As shown in Fig. 7 c, if the interdomain contacts occur between the D1 and D3, drAsp will form one potential active site.It is not surprising that drAsp variants have diminished or no activity due to the sensitivity of catalytic efficiency to structural perturbations. However, through long range tertiary interactions, the residues inserted between the repeated D2 units can dramatically influence the potential active site, a small fraction of which will possibly be beneficial to the enzyme's catalytic activity, presumably by restoring proper interactions for folding, stability, and adjusting the spacial position and orientation of residues in the potential active site. Given the uncertainties in predicting the optimal inserted sequence with exacting conformational control required for efficient enzyme catalysis, the most appropriate method is randomization of the inserted sequence, followed by a directed selection for the activity ofl-aspartase. Since changes have occurred in the structure of drAsp variants, it is likely that some of them form monomers, without aggregation to form a 20-helix cluster structure.By mimicking the partial spatial structure of the native dimer of thel-aspartase subunit, we obtained its functional monomer. Such structure-based rational approaches to protein engineering, combined with the randomization insert sequence, have given rise to the enzyme with altered oligomeric states. Converting oligomeric proteins into their functional monomers could have important applications, since monomeric proteins do not dissociate into the non-active form and have advantages for activity-reversibility and lower immunogenicity in protein medicine (31Viola R.E. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 2000; 74: 295-341PubMed Google Scholar). The monomeric l-aspartase and the method described here may serve as model system for studying the mechanism by which oligomer proteins change to the monomeric form. In this study, we considered that the conversion of thel-aspartase tetramer into its functional monomer would be facilitated by in vitro selection.
