https://openalex.org/W2604452705,"Chromatin and metabolic states both influence lifespan, but how they interact in lifespan regulation is largely unknown. The COMPASS chromatin complex, which trimethylates lysine 4 on histone H3 (H3K4me3), regulates lifespan in Caenorhabditis elegans. However, the mechanism by which H3K4me3 modifiers affect longevity, and whether this mechanism involves metabolic changes, remain unclear. Here we show that a deficiency in H3K4me3 methyltransferase, which extends lifespan, promotes fat accumulation in worms with a specific enrichment of mono-unsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs). This fat metabolism switch in H3K4me3 methyltransferase-deficient worms is mediated at least in part by the downregulation of germline targets, including S6 kinase, and by the activation of an intestinal transcriptional network that upregulates delta-9 fatty acid desaturases. Notably, the accumulation of MUFAs is necessary for the lifespan extension of H3K4me3 methyltransferase-deficient worms, and dietary MUFAs are sufficient to extend lifespan. Given the conservation of lipid metabolism, dietary or endogenous MUFAs could extend lifespan and healthspan in other species, including mammals."
https://openalex.org/W2604658068,"The neuron-specific transcription factor Myt1l represses many somatic lineage programs, but not the neuronal lineage program, to both induce and maintain neuronal identity. Lineage reprogramming by expression of transcription factors that modulate target cell fate program requires gene expression of the donor cell to be silenced. Given our current knowledge, we would expect that each reprogramming cocktail would need to differ for distinct cells of origin, but intriguingly this has not been the case experimentally so far. Marius Wernig and colleagues have found that the neuronal reprogramming factor Myt1l, which is expressed in all neurons, promotes neuronal fate in mice by repressing all other lineages during reprogramming from other cell types as well as during neurogenesis and in primary neurons. Their data suggests that changing epigenetic marks would not be sufficient to maintain a particular cell fate, and alternative lineages are actively repressed to confer neuronal identity. Normal differentiation and induced reprogramming require the activation of target cell programs and silencing of donor cell programs1,2. In reprogramming, the same factors are often used to reprogram many different donor cell types3. As most developmental repressors, such as RE1-silencing transcription factor (REST) and Groucho (also known as TLE), are considered lineage-specific repressors4,5, it remains unclear how identical combinations of transcription factors can silence so many different donor programs. Distinct lineage repressors would have to be induced in different donor cell types. Here, by studying the reprogramming of mouse fibroblasts to neurons, we found that the pan neuron-specific transcription factor Myt1-like (Myt1l)6 exerts its pro-neuronal function by direct repression of many different somatic lineage programs except the neuronal program. The repressive function of Myt1l is mediated via recruitment of a complex containing Sin3b by binding to a previously uncharacterized N-terminal domain. In agreement with its repressive function, the genomic binding sites of Myt1l are similar in neurons and fibroblasts and are preferentially in an open chromatin configuration. The Notch signalling pathway is repressed by Myt1l through silencing of several members, including Hes1. Acute knockdown of Myt1l in the developing mouse brain mimicked a Notch gain-of-function phenotype, suggesting that Myt1l allows newborn neurons to escape Notch activation during normal development. Depletion of Myt1l in primary postmitotic neurons de-repressed non-neuronal programs and impaired neuronal gene expression and function, indicating that many somatic lineage programs are actively and persistently repressed by Myt1l to maintain neuronal identity. It is now tempting to speculate that similar ‘many-but-one’ lineage repressors exist for other cell fates; such repressors, in combination with lineage-specific activators, would be prime candidates for use in reprogramming additional cell types."
https://openalex.org/W2605291555,"The angiotensin II receptors AT1R and AT2R serve as key components of the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system. AT1R has a central role in the regulation of blood pressure, but the function of AT2R is unclear and it has a variety of reported effects. To identify the mechanisms that underlie the differences in function and ligand selectivity between these receptors, here we report crystal structures of human AT2R bound to an AT2R-selective ligand and to an AT1R/AT2R dual ligand, capturing the receptor in an active-like conformation. Unexpectedly, helix VIII was found in a non-canonical position, stabilizing the active-like state, but at the same time preventing the recruitment of G proteins or β-arrestins, in agreement with the lack of signalling responses in standard cellular assays. Structure–activity relationship, docking and mutagenesis studies revealed the crucial interactions for ligand binding and selectivity. Our results thus provide insights into the structural basis of the distinct functions of the angiotensin receptors, and may guide the design of new selective ligands. Crystal structures of two complexes of the angiotensin II receptor AT2R with distinct tightly bound ligands reveal an active-like state of the receptor, in which helix VIII adopts a non-canonical position that blocks binding of G proteins and β-arrestins. The angiotensin receptors AT1R and AT2R are G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) with important roles in blood pressure regulation. Although AT2R is an important drug target for cardioprotection and for treating neuropathic pain and is believed to counteract several effects mediated by AT1R, its structure and function are not well understood. In this work, the authors report several crystal structures of AT2R in complex with two tightly bound ligands. These structures show a significant conformational rearrangement of the transmembrane helices to an active-like state that is similar to other class A GPCRs, save for one remarkable difference. In the active-like conformation, helix VIII adopts a non-canonical position, which not only stabilizes the state but also blocks the canonical signalling pathway of GPCRs by preventing binding of the G protein and β-arrestin. This challenges the notion of differentiating these ligands as 'agonists' or 'antagonists', or terming the state as 'active', as it precludes signalling partner interactions."
https://openalex.org/W2605168226,"Genome sequencing and proteomic analyses of the crown-of-thorns starfish identify species-specific secreted factors that are associated with aggregating starfish and might be useful for biocontrol strategies. Crown-of-thorns starfish (COTS) are a predator of reef-building corals throughout the Indo-Pacific, where population outbreaks have led to loss of coral cover and biodiversity. Bernie Degnan and colleagues now report sequencing of the genomes of two COTS, Acanthaster planci, from the Great Barrier Reef in Australia and the reefs of Okinawa, Japan. They also sequenced transcriptomes from several external tissues and organs, and examined secreted proteins released into the water by aggregated or alarmed COTS. The genomic insights provided by this study may help to guide development of targeted treatments for reef-threatening outbreaks of the predatory starfish. The crown-of-thorns starfish (COTS, the Acanthaster planci species group) is a highly fecund predator of reef-building corals throughout the Indo-Pacific region1. COTS population outbreaks cause substantial loss of coral cover, diminishing the integrity and resilience of reef ecosystems2,3,4,5,6. Here we sequenced genomes of COTS from the Great Barrier Reef, Australia and Okinawa, Japan to identify gene products that underlie species-specific communication and could potentially be used in biocontrol strategies. We focused on water-borne chemical plumes released from aggregating COTS, which make the normally sedentary starfish become highly active. Peptide sequences detected in these plumes by mass spectrometry are encoded in the COTS genome and expressed in external tissues. The exoproteome released by aggregating COTS consists largely of signalling factors and hydrolytic enzymes, and includes an expanded and rapidly evolving set of starfish-specific ependymin-related proteins. These secreted proteins may be detected by members of a large family of olfactory-receptor-like G-protein-coupled receptors that are expressed externally, sometimes in a sex-specific manner. This study provides insights into COTS-specific communication that may guide the generation of peptide mimetics for use on reefs with COTS outbreaks."
https://openalex.org/W2605205065,"Depending on prediction accuracy at the time of memory recall, specific mushroom body output neurons drive different combinations of dopaminergic neurons to extinguish or reconsolidate appetitive memory in Drosophila. The changeability of memories upon recall allows animals to constantly reassess the reliability of learned information, but the neural mechanisms governing these updating processes remain largely unknown. Now, Scott Waddell and colleagues have mapped the dopaminergic neurons that interact with specific mushroom body output neurons in the Drosophila brain in order to produce either extinction or reconsolidation of a food-related memory (the association of a specific odour with a sugar reward) by the introduction of a prediction error (new exposure to the odour without reward). Finding similarly segregated feedback connections in mammals should instruct on-going procedures aiming to alleviate harmful memories in stressed humans. Animals constantly assess the reliability of learned information to optimize their behaviour. On retrieval, consolidated long-term memory can be neutralized by extinction if the learned prediction was inaccurate1. Alternatively, retrieved memory can be maintained, following a period of reconsolidation during which it is labile2. Although extinction and reconsolidation provide opportunities to alleviate problematic human memories3,4,5, we lack a detailed mechanistic understanding of memory updating. Here we identify neural operations underpinning the re-evaluation of memory in Drosophila. Reactivation of reward-reinforced olfactory memory can lead to either extinction or reconsolidation, depending on prediction accuracy. Each process recruits activity in specific parts of the mushroom body output network and distinct subsets of reinforcing dopaminergic neurons. Memory extinction requires output neurons with dendrites in the α and α′ lobes of the mushroom body, which drive negatively reinforcing dopaminergic neurons that innervate neighbouring zones. The aversive valence of these new extinction memories neutralizes previously learned odour preference. Memory reconsolidation requires the γ2α′1 mushroom body output neurons. This pathway recruits negatively reinforcing dopaminergic neurons innervating the same compartment and re-engages positively reinforcing dopaminergic neurons to reconsolidate the original reward memory. These data establish that recurrent and hierarchical connectivity between mushroom body output neurons and dopaminergic neurons enables memory re-evaluation driven by reward-prediction error."
https://openalex.org/W2604324397,"We aimed to investigate the expressions of three Th17-associated cytokines, interleukin (IL)-17A, IL-6 and IL-23, in protein and mRNA levels and their correlations with ocular surface parameters in patients with dry eye disease (DED) through a small sample size case control study. A total of 45 female subjects were divided into Sjögren's syndrome (SS) DED group, non-Sjögren's syndrome (non-SS) DED group and control group. Ocular surface disease index (OSDI) was self-answered and clinical tests including tear-film breakup time (BUT), Schirmer I test, cornea fluorescein staining (CFS) were performed. The conjunctival mRNA expressions of these cytokines were investigated by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and the levels of protein in tears were measured by mutiplex bead analysis. The correlations between cytokines and ocular surface parameters were analyzed. Results show that the expressions of IL-17A and IL-6 in protein and mRNA levels were both significantly increased in the DED group (P<0.05), and also higher in SS group comparing to the non-SS group (P<0.05). Moreover, IL-17A and IL-6 correlated well with ocular surface parameters (all P<0.05, R values range from 0.5-0.8). Despite the expression of IL-23 was significantly increased in the DED group (P<0.05), there was no significant difference found between the expressions of IL-23 in SS group and non-SS group (P>0.05) and no correlation found between the IL-23 and any ocular surface parameter (P>0.05). These findings indicates that the three Th17-associated cytokines, IL-17A, IL-6 and IL-23, play roles in the pathogenesis of DED and the expressions of IL-17A and IL-6 in tears have potential to be diagnostic biomarkers for DED."
https://openalex.org/W2605273121,"Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has become a commonplace procedure for the treatment of aortic stenosis in higher risk surgical patients. With the high cost and steadily increasing number of patients receiving TAVR, emphasis has been placed on optimizing outcomes as well as resource utilization. Recently, studies have demonstrated the feasibility of conscious sedation in lieu of general anesthesia for TAVR. This study aimed to investigate the clinical as well as cost outcomes associated with conscious sedation in comparison to general anesthesia in TAVR.Records for all adult patients undergoing TAVR at our institution between August 2012 and June 2016 were included using our institutional Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) and American College of Cardiology (ACC) registries. Cost data was gathered using the BIOME database. Patients were stratified into two groups according to whether they received general anesthesia (GA) or conscious sedation (CS) during the procedure. No-replacement propensity score matching was done using the validated STS predicted risk of mortality (PROM) as a propensity score. Primary outcome measure with survival to discharge and several secondary outcome measures were also included in analysis. According to our institution's data reporting guidelines, all cost data is presented as a percentage of the general anesthesia control group cost.Of the 231 patients initially identified, 225 (157 GA, 68 CS) were included for analysis. After no-replacement propensity score matching, 196 patients (147 GA, 49 CS) remained. Overall mortality was 1.5% in the matched population with a trend towards lower mortality in the CS group. Conscious sedation was associated with significantly fewer ICU hours (30 vs 96 hours, p = <0.001) and total hospital days (4.9 vs 10.4, p<0.001). Additionally, there was a 28% decrease in direct cost (p<0.001) as well as significant decreases in all individual all cost categories associated with the use of conscious sedation. There was no difference in composite major adverse events between groups. These trends remained on all subsequent subgroup analyses.Conscious sedation is emerging as a safe and viable option for anesthesia in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement. The use of conscious sedation was not only associated with similar rates of adverse events, but also shortened ICU and overall hospital stays. Finally, there were significant decreases in all cost categories when compared to a propensity matched cohort receiving general anesthesia."
https://openalex.org/W2604570082,"The accumulation of soluble amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides produces profound neuronal changes in the brain during the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. Excessive levels of Aβ disrupt excitatory synaptic transmission by promoting the removal of synaptic AMPA receptors (AMPARs), dendritic spine loss, and synaptic depression. Recently, activity-dependent ubiquitination of the GluA1 subunit has been shown to regulate the intracellular sorting of AMPARs toward late endosomes for degradation. However, whether this ubiquitin signaling pathway mediates Aβ-induced loss of surface AMPARs is unknown. In this study, we demonstrate that acute exposure of cultured neurons to soluble Aβ oligomers induces AMPAR ubiquitination concomitant with the removal of AMPARs from the plasma membrane. Importantly, expression of the GluA1 ubiquitin-deficient mutants inhibited the adverse effects of Aβ on the surface expression of AMPARs in neurons. Furthermore, we revealed the cross-talk between GluA1 ubiquitination and phosphorylation, in particular phosphorylation at Ser-845, which is crucial for AMPAR recycling and is known to be dephosphorylated in the presence of Aβ. Our data showed that the GluA1 ubiquitin-deficient mutant enhances GluA1 phosphorylation on Ser-845. Conversely, the GluA1 S845D phosphomimetic mutant reduced binding with Nedd4-1 and hence the ubiquitination of AMPARs. Importantly, the GluA1 S845D mutant also prevented Aβ-induced removal of surface AMPARs. Taken together, these findings provide the first demonstration of the dynamic cross-modulation of GluA1 ubiquitination and phosphorylation, a process that is perturbed by Aβ, in regulating the membrane sorting decision that ultimately determines the number of AMPARs on the cell surface.

Studies have shown that soluble oligomeric forms of Aβ peptides derived by proteolytic cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP), of which Aβ(1–42) (hereafter referred to as Aβ) is one of the predominant species, exert strong detrimental effects on the structure and function of synapses that could be directly linked to the learning and memory deficits in Alzheimer's patients (2Sheng M.

Collectively, these data suggest that Aβ promotes the internalization and degradation of AMPARs as well as negatively regulates the recycling of these receptors back to the plasma membrane. Interestingly, a recent study has shown that shRNA-mediated knockdown of Nedd4-1 blocks the Aβ-induced reduction in surface AMPARs (17Rodrigues E.M. Scudder S.L. Goo M.S. Patrick G.N. Aβ-induced synaptic alterations require the E3 ubiquitin ligase Nedd4-1.J. Neurosci. 2016; 36: 1590-1595Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar); however, whether this process is mediated by direct ubiquitination of AMPARs is unclear. Furthermore, it is also unknown whether Aβ-induced dephosphorylation of GluA1 at Ser-845 affects the ubiquitination of AMPARs. In the present study, we reveal that direct ubiquitination of the GluA1 subunit of AMPARs is an essential signaling pathway that mediates the Aβ-induced loss of surface AMPARs in primary cortical neurons. In addition, we show that the GluA1 S845D phosphomimetic mutant negatively regulates the ubiquitination of AMPARs due to reduced binding of Nedd4-1. This in turn also inhibits the loss of surface AMPAR expression following Aβ treatment. These results provide insights into the importance of dynamic cross-talk between GluA1 phosphorylation and ubiquitination in controlling AMPAR trafficking and cell surface expression. It is well established that soluble Aβ oligomers, either synthetic or those secreted from cell lines, potently block hippocampal long-term potentiation and promote long-term depression via mechanisms that involve the down-regulation of surface AMPARs (9Shankar G.M.

Recent studies have demonstrated a role for GluA1 ubiquitination in regulating the internalization and intracellular sorting of AMPARs toward late endosomes (21Lin A. Hou Q. Jarzylo L. Amato S.

Based on these findings, we hypothesized that the same ubiquitin signaling pathway is involved in the Aβ-induced reduction of surface AMPAR expression in neurons. To investigate this, we first examined the effect of soluble synthetic Aβ oligomers on AMPAR ubiquitination in cultured cortical neurons by immunoprecipitating the GluA1 subunit from lysates of neurons that had been treated with 5 μm Aβ for 1 h. We found that GluA1 was robustly ubiquitinated following Aβ treatment (5.53 ± 2.5-fold of DMSO-treated control) (Fig. 1, A and B). Next, we treated neurons with different concentration of Aβ for 1 h and generated a dose-response curve. We found that Aβ enhanced the ubiquitination of GluA1 in a dose-dependent manner, producing the maximal effect at 10 μm (4.8 ± 0.8-fold of DMSO-treated control) (Fig. 1, C and D). However, we chose to use 5 μm for the remainder of our study because this was the minimal concentration of Aβ that significantly induced GluA1 ubiquitination (3.0 ± 0.7-fold of DMSO-treated control) (Fig. 1, C and D), thereby minimizing Aβ neurotoxicity that might lead to cell death. To confirm these findings, we performed a reverse immunoprecipitation assay using anti-ubiquitin antibodies on lysates extracted from Aβ-treated neurons and then blotted them with specific antibodies against the GluA1 subunit. We observed high-molecular-weight GluA1 immunoreactivity in the lysates of Aβ-treated neurons that was absent in the control lane (Fig. 1E). Together, these results demonstrate that Aβ induces the ubiquitination of the GluA1 subunit of AMPARs in primary cortical neurons. We next examined the loss of surface AMPARs following 1 h of Aβ treatment. Cortical neurons were electroporated with pHluorin (pH-sensitive GFP)-tagged GluA1 (pH-GluA1), either wild type, K868R, or qKR (all four lysines in the C-terminal tail mutated to arginines; K813R/K819R/K822R/K868R) at days in vitro (DIV) 0 and were subjected to a biotinylation assay to label the surface proteins at DIV13. As expected, 1-h incubation with Aβ caused a robust down-regulation of surface pH-GluA1 expression (GluA1 wild type (WT), 54.7 ± 5.4% of DMSO-treated control) (Fig. 2, A and B). Interestingly, Aβ failed to reduce the surface expression of both the pH-GluA1 ubiquitin-deficient mutants (GluA1 K868R, 79.1 ± 8.4%; GluA1 qKR, 103.7 ± 10.5% of DMSO-treated controls) (Fig. 2, A and B). No apparent alteration in the expression of total pH-GluA1 was observed after Aβ treatment across genotypes (Fig. 2, A and C). To confirm this finding, we performed a surface staining assay on neurons expressing pH-GluA1 (either wild type or K868R or qKR mutant) with anti-GFP antibodies that recognize the extracellular pHluorin. Consistent with our surface biotinylation data, Aβ robustly reduced the surface expression of wild-type pH-GluA1 (GluA1 WT, 59.3 ± 3.2% of DMSO-treated control) (Fig. 3, A and B). In contrast, Aβ failed to reduce the surface expression of both the pH-GluA1 ubiquitin-deficient mutants (GluA1 K868R, 95.8 ± 5.5%; GluA1 qKR, 101.8 ± 5.3% of DMSO-treated controls) (Fig. 3, A and B). No apparent alteration in the expression of the presynaptic marker synaptophysin on the dendrite was observed after Aβ treatment across genotypes (Fig. 3, A and C). Collectively, these data provide the first evidence for the requirement of direct ubiquitination of GluA1 in mediating the ability of Aβ to promote the down-regulation of surface AMPARs in primary cortical neurons. The GluA1 subunit is phosphorylated at two major sites in its C-terminal domain, namely Ser-831 and Ser-845, by protein kinase C (PKC) or calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase II and PKA, respectively (18Roche K.W.

Although phosphorylation of GluA1 is known to be important for AMPAR trafficking and synaptic plasticity (28Lu W. Roche K.W. Posttranslational regulation of AMPA receptor trafficking and function.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2012; 22: 470-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), it has also been shown to prevent AMPARs from undergoing lysosomal degradation (29Kessels H.W. Kopec C.D. Klein M.E.

U.S.A. 2009; 106: 20033-20038Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). We proposed that the phosphorylation of GluA1 might modulate its ubiquitination status to fine-tune the trafficking and stability of AMPARs in neurons. To address this possibility, we first examined the effects of GluA1 ubiquitin-deficient mutants on Ser-831 and Ser-845 phosphorylation induced by phorbol ester PMA and forskolin treatment, respectively. We found that neurons that overexpressed pH-GluA1 K868R and qKR mutants displayed significantly enhanced levels of Ser-845 phosphorylation compared with pH-GluA1 wild type (GluA1 K868R, 163.1 ± 21%; GluA1 qKR, 220.7 ± 42.6% of forskolin-treated WT) (Fig. 4, A and B). These effects were specific for Ser-845 phosphorylation as the ubiquitin-deficient mutants did not alter the levels of Ser-831 phosphorylation induced by PMA (GluA1 K868R, 116.0 ± 4.9%; GluA1 qKR, 102.6 ± 8.9% of PMA-treated WT) (Fig. 4, C and D). Next, we investigated the reciprocal effects of GluA1 phosphorylation mutants on the levels of AMPA-induced ubiquitination of this subunit. To do this, we electroporated pH-GluA1, either wild type, phosphodeficient mutant (Ser to Ala mutation), or phosphomimetic mutant (Ser to Asp mutation), at DIV0 and performed the ubiquitination assay at DIV13. We found that the pH-GluA1 S845D phosphomimetic mutant, but not the pH-GluA1 S845A phosphodeficient mutant, reduced the amount of GluA1 ubiquitination evoked by AMPA treatment (GluA1 S845D, 65.2 ± 3.1%; GluA1 S845A, 106.6 ± 11.4% of WT control) (Fig. 5, A and B). In contrast, neither the S831A nor the S831D mutant affected the level of GluA1 ubiquitination induced by AMPA treatment (GluA1 S831A, 130.2 ± 23.0%; GluA1 S831D, 111.9 ± 23.0% of WT control) (Fig. 5, A and B). These data indicate that the phosphorylation of Ser-845 negatively regulates GluA1 ubiquitination and that receptors that are not ubiquitinated have a higher level of Ser-845 phosphorylation. To further understand the underlying mechanism, we investigated the effects of GluA1 phosphomutants on Nedd4-1 binding. HEK293 cells were co-transfected with HA-Nedd4-1 and pH-GluA1 constructs, either wild type or Ser-831/Ser-845 phosphodeficient and phosphomimetic mutants. As expected, wild-type pH-GluA1 interacted with HA-Nedd4-1 in the co-immunoprecipitation assay (Fig. 5, C and D). However, their interaction was significantly reduced only by the S845D substitution, whereas the other mutants had no effect on GluA1-Nedd4-1 binding (GluA1 S845D, 53.2 ± 9.1%; GluA1 S845A, 90.9 ± 19.9%; GluA1 S831D, 111.6 ± 22.2%; GluA1 S831A, 74.1 ± 21.6% of WT control) (Fig. 5, C and D). We also attempted to perform this experiment in cultured neurons, but we were unable to detect a specific interaction between pH-GluA1 and endogenous Nedd4-1. Collectively, these results suggest that the phosphorylation of GluA1 on Ser-845 is likely to inhibit its binding to Nedd4-1, thereby reducing the level of GluA1 ubiquitination. Given that a previous study has shown that an Aβ-induced reduction in surface GluA1 is linked to persistent dephosphorylation of GluA1 at Ser-845 (11Miñano-Molina A.J. España J. Martín E. Barneda-Zahonero B. Fadó R. Solé M. Trullás R. Saura C.A. Rodríguez-Alvarez J. Soluble oligomers of amyloid-β peptide disrupt membrane trafficking of α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid receptor contributing to early synapse dysfunction.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 27311-27321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), we considered that dephosphorylation of GluA1 at Ser-845 may be an upstream signal that allows GluA1 to be ubiquitinated and mediate the Aβ-induced reduction in surface AMPARs. Given that GluA1 S845D binds weakly to Nedd4-1 and has reduced levels of ubiquitination, it should prevent Aβ-induced down-regulation of surface AMPARs. To test this hypothesis, we examined the surface expression of pH-GluA1 S845D and S845A mutants following 1 h of Aβ treatment. When surface expression of pH-GluA1 was examined, the phosphomimetic S845D mutant inhibited the neurotoxic effect of Aβ, whereas the wild type and phosphodeficient S845A mutant had significantly lower expression on the plasma membrane (GluA1 WT, 75.3 ± 7.5%; GluA1 S845D, 96.1 ± 4.0%; S845A, 77.0 ± 5.1% of DMSO-treated controls) (Fig. 6, A and B). No apparent alteration in the expression of total pH-GluA1 expression was observed after Aβ treatment across genotypes (Fig. 6, A and C). These data indicate that the phosphorylation of GluA1 at Ser-845 is essential to recycle AMPARs back to the plasma membrane.

Although embryonic deletion of the Pax6 gene in mice leads to loss of most pancreatic islet cell types, the functional consequences of Pax6 loss in adults are poorly defined. Here we developed a mouse line in which Pax6 was selectively inactivated in β cells by crossing animals with floxed Pax6 alleles to mice expressing the inducible Pdx1CreERT transgene. Pax6 deficiency, achieved by tamoxifen injection, caused progressive hyperglycemia. Although β cell mass was preserved 8 days post-injection, total insulin content and insulin:chromogranin A immunoreactivity were reduced by ∼60%, and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion was eliminated. RNA sequencing and quantitative real-time PCR analyses revealed that, although the expression of key β cell genes, including Ins2, Slc30a8, MafA, Slc2a2, G6pc2, and Glp1r, was reduced after Pax6 deletion, that of several genes that are usually selectively repressed (""disallowed"") in β cells, including Slc16a1, was increased. Assessed in intact islets, glucose-induced ATP:ADP increases were significantly reduced (p < 0.05) in βPax6KO versus control β cells, and the former displayed attenuated increases in cytosolic Ca2+ Unexpectedly, glucose-induced increases in intercellular connectivity were enhanced after Pax6 deletion, consistent with increases in the expression of the glucose sensor glucokinase, but decreases in that of two transcription factors usually expressed in fully differentiated β-cells, Pdx1 and Nkx6.1, were observed in islet ""hub"" cells. These results indicate that Pax6 is required for the functional identity of adult β cells. Furthermore, deficiencies in β cell glucose sensing are likely to contribute to defective insulin secretion in human carriers of PAX6 mutations."

Whether it plays a role in colorectal cancer (CRC) development remains unclear. Here, we investigated whether and through what mechanism LRG1 functions in human CRC cells. The plasma level of LRG1 was significantly increased in CRC patients, but it was remarkably decreased in patients with resected colorectal cancers. Meanwhile, both mRNA and protein levels of LRG1 were remarkable overexpressed in CRC tissues than normal tissues. The knockdown of LRG1 significantly inhibited cell proliferation, induced cell cycle arrest at the G0/G1 phase, and promoted apoptosis in SW480 and HCT116 cells in vitro. In addition, LRG1 silencing led to the downregulation of the levels of key cell cycle factors, such as cyclin D1, B, and E and anti-apoptotic B-cell lymphoma-2(Bcl-2). However, it up-regulated the expression of pro-apoptotic Bax and cleaved caspase-3. Furthermore, RUNX1 could be induced by LRG1 in a concentration-dependent manner, while the knockdown of RUNX1 blocked the promotion of the proliferation and inhibition of apoptosis induced by LRG1. Collectively, these findings indicate that LRG1 plays a crucial role in the proliferation and apoptosis of CRC by regulating RUNX1 expression. Thus, LRG1 may be a potential detection biomarker as well as a marker for monitoring recurrence and therapeutic target for CRC."
https://openalex.org/W2604512261,"This paper presents a region-based active contour method for the segmentation of intensity inhomogeneous images using an energy functional based on local and global fitted images. A square image fitted model is defined by using both local and global fitted differences. Moreover, local and global signed pressure force functions are introduced in the solution of the energy functional to stabilize the gradient descent flow. In the final gradient descent solution, the local fitted term helps extract regions with intensity inhomogeneity, whereas the global fitted term targets homogeneous regions. A Gaussian kernel is applied to regularize the contour at each step, which not only smoothes it but also avoids the computationally expensive re-initialization. Intensity inhomogeneous images contain undesired smooth intensity variations (bias field) that alter the results of intensity-based segmentation methods. The bias field is approximated with a Gaussian distribution and the bias of intensity inhomogeneous regions is corrected by dividing the original image by the approximated bias field. In this paper, a two-phase model is first derived and then extended to a four-phase model to segment brain magnetic resonance (MR) images into the desired regions of interest. Experimental results with both synthetic and real brain MR images are used for a quantitative and qualitative comparison with state-of-the-art active contour methods to show the advantages of the proposed segmentation technique in practical terms."

Transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1) and bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP-2) induce pro-osteogenic activation of human aortic valve interstitial cells (AVICs) that play an important role in valvular calcification. However, the molecular mechanism underlying pro-osteogenic activation in AVICs is incompletely understood. Here, we investigated an epigenetic regulatory mechanism in human AVIC pro-osteogenic activation induced by TGF-β1 and BMP-2. Microarray and real-time PCR analyses revealed that microRNA (miR)-486 up-regulation and miR-204 down-regulation were characteristic changes in TGF-β1- and BMP-2-stimulated normal AVICs and in AVICs from calcified valves. Both TGF-β1 and BMP-2 down-regulated miR-204 through Smad pathways. Interestingly, an miR-486 antagomir diminished the effect of TGF-β1 and BMP-2 on miR-204 levels and calcium deposit formation. Furthermore, the miR-486 antagomir increased the expression of Smurf2, a Smad inhibitor, in the presence or absence of TGF-β1 or BMP-2 stimulation, whereas a miR-486 mimic reduced Smurf2 expression. Smurf2 knockdown augmented TGF-β1- or BMP-2-induced miR-204 down-regulation and resulted in increased expression of the osteoblastic biomarkers Osx and Runx2. In summary, we found that TGF-β1 and BMP-2 up-regulate miR-486 and down-regulate miR-204 in human AVICs to promote pro-osteogenic activity and that miR-486 inhibits Smurf2 expression to augment the miR-204 down-regulation.

https://openalex.org/W2604489278,"The geographic distribution and habitat association of most mammalian polymorphic phenotypes are still poorly known, hampering assessments of their adaptive significance. Even in the case of the black panther, an iconic melanistic variant of the leopard (Panthera pardus), no map exists describing its distribution. We constructed a large database of verified records sampled across the species’ range, and used it to map the geographic occurrence of melanism. We then estimated the potential distribution of melanistic and non-melanistic leopards using niche-modeling algorithms. The overall frequency of melanism was ca. 11%, with a significantly non-random spatial distribution. Distinct habitat types presented significantly different frequencies of melanism, which increased in Asian moist forests and approached zero across most open/dry biomes. Niche modeling indicated that the potential distributions of the two phenotypes were distinct, with significant differences in habitat suitability and rejection of niche equivalency between them. We conclude that melanism in leopards is strongly affected by natural selection, likely driven by efficacy of camouflage and/or thermoregulation in different habitats, along with an effect of moisture that goes beyond its influence on vegetation type. Our results support classical hypotheses of adaptive coloration in animals (e.g. Gloger’s rule), and open up new avenues for in-depth evolutionary analyses of melanism in mammals."

https://openalex.org/W2604760898,"Scap is a polytopic protein of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes that transports sterol regulatory element-binding proteins to the Golgi complex for proteolytic activation. Cholesterol accumulation in ER membranes prevents Scap transport and decreases cholesterol synthesis. Previously, we provided evidence that cholesterol inhibition is initiated when cholesterol binds to loop 1 of Scap, which projects into the ER lumen. Within cells, this binding causes loop 1 to dissociate from loop 7, another luminal Scap loop. However, we have been unable to demonstrate this dissociation when we added cholesterol to isolated complexes of loops 1 and 7. We therefore speculated that the dissociation requires a conformational change in the intervening polytopic sequence separating loops 1 and 7. Here we demonstrate such a change using a protease protection assay in sealed membrane vesicles. In the absence of cholesterol, trypsin or proteinase K cleaved cytosolic loop 4, generating a protected fragment that we visualized with a monoclonal antibody against loop 1. When cholesterol was added to these membranes, cleavage in loop 4 was abolished. Because loop 4 is part of the so-called sterol-sensing domain separating loops 1 and 7, these results support the hypothesis that cholesterol binding to loop 1 alters the conformation of the sterol-sensing domain. They also suggest that this conformational change helps transmit the cholesterol signal from loop 1 to loop 7, thereby allowing separation of the loops and facilitating the feedback inhibition of cholesterol synthesis. These insights suggest a new structural model for cholesterol-mediated regulation of Scap activity.

Within cells, this binding causes loop 1 to dissociate from loop 7, another luminal Scap loop. However, we have been unable to demonstrate this dissociation when we added cholesterol to isolated complexes of loops 1 and 7. We therefore speculated that the dissociation requires a conformational change in the intervening polytopic sequence separating loops 1 and 7. Here we demonstrate such a change using a protease protection assay in sealed membrane vesicles. In the absence of cholesterol, trypsin or proteinase K cleaved cytosolic loop 4, generating a protected fragment that we visualized with a monoclonal antibody against loop 1. When cholesterol was added to these membranes, cleavage in loop 4 was abolished. Because loop 4 is part of the so-called sterol-sensing domain separating loops 1 and 7, these results support the hypothesis that cholesterol binding to loop 1 alters the conformation of the sterol-sensing domain. They also suggest that this conformational change helps transmit the cholesterol signal from loop 1 to loop 7, thereby allowing separation of the loops and facilitating the feedback inhibition of cholesterol synthesis. These insights suggest a new structural model for cholesterol-mediated regulation of Scap activity."

The clinicopathological characteristics of duodenal epithelial tumors remain a matter of debate. We therefore studied resected specimens to investigate the clinicopathological characteristics of duodenal epithelial tumors.Among duodenal epithelial tumors resected endoscopically or surgically in our hospital, we studied the clinicopathological characteristics of 110 adenomas or intramucosal carcinomas. The grade of atypia of all tumors was classified into 3 groups according to the World Health Organization (WHO) 2010 classification. The tumors were immunohistochemically evaluated to determine the frequency of differentiation toward fundic glands.As for patient characteristics, there were 76 men (75.2%) and 25 women (24.8%), with a median age of 65 years (range, 34 to 84). The tumors most commonly arose in the first to second part of the duodenum. Many lesions were flat, and the median tumor diameter was 8.0 mm. The lesions were classified into 2 types according to mucin phenotype: intestinal-type tumors (98 lesions, 89.1%) and gastric-type tumors (12 lesions, 10.9%). Intestinal-type tumors were subdivided into 2 groups: tubular-type tumors (91 lesions, 82.7%) and tubulovillous-type tumors (7 lesions, 6.4%). Gastric-type tumors were classified into 2 types: foveolar type (3 lesions, 2.7%) and pyloric gland-type (PG) tumors (9 lesions, 8.2%). The grade of atypia was significantly higher in gastric-type tumors (p<0.01). PG tumors were gastric-type tumors characterized by pyloric glands and findings suggesting differentiation toward fundic glands.About 10% of the duodenal tumors had a gastric-type mucin phenotype. Gastric-type tumors showed high-grade atypia. In particular, PG tumors showed similarities to PG tumors of the stomach, such as differentiation toward fundic glands."

A genomic region, DR1 of 127 kb, together with another region, DR2 of 171 kb, was duplicated by unequal crossing over, accompanied by inversion of one DR2. Quantitative PCR and copy number variation analyses on the Cemani genome sequence confirmed the duplication of EDN3. These genetic arrangements are identical in Cemani and Silkie, indicating a single origin of the genetic cause of Fm. The two DR1s harbor two distinct EDN3 haplotypes in a form of permanent heterozygosity, although they remain allelic in the ancestral Red Jungle Fowl population and some domesticated chicken breeds, with their allelic divergence time being as recent as 0.3 million years ago. In Cemani and Silkie breeds, artificial selection favoring the Fm phenotype has left an unambiguous record for selective sweep that extends in both directions from tandemly duplicated EDN3 loci. This highly homozygous tract is different in length between Cemani and Silkie, reflecting their distinct breeding histories. It is estimated that the Fm phenotype came into existence at least 6600–9100 years ago, prior to domestication of Cemani and Silkie, and that throughout domestication there has been intense artificial selection with strength s > 50% in each breed."

Escherichia coli class Ia RNR is composed of α and β subunits that form a transient, active α2β2 complex. The E. coli RNR is rate-limited by S/e-dependent conformational change(s) that trigger the radical initiation step through a pathway of 35 Å across the subunit (α/β) interface. The weak subunit affinity and complex nucleotide-dependent quaternary structures have precluded a molecular understanding of the kinetic gating mechanism(s) of the RNR machinery. Using a docking model of α2β2 created from X-ray structures of α and β and conserved residues from a new subclassification of the E. coli Ia RNR (Iag), we identified and investigated four residues at the α/β interface (Glu350 and Glu52 in β2 and Arg329 and Arg639 in α2) of potential interest in kinetic gating. Mutation of each residue resulted in loss of activity and with the exception of E52Q-β2, weakened subunit affinity. An RNR mutant with 2,3,5-trifluorotyrosine radical (F3Y122•) replacing the stable Tyr122• in WT-β2, a mutation that partly overcomes conformational gating, was placed in the E52Q background. Incubation of this double mutant with His6-α2/S/e resulted in an RNR capable of catalyzing pathway-radical formation (Tyr356•-β2), 0.5 eq of dCDP/F3Y122•, and formation of an α2β2 complex that is isolable in pulldown assays over 2 h. Negative stain EM images with S/e (GDP/TTP) revealed the uniformity of the α2β2 complex formed."

RIMs confer sustained activity and anchoring of synaptic vesicles to the VDCCs. Multiple sites on the VDCC α1 and β subunits have been reported to mediate the RIMs-VDCC interaction, but their significance is unclear. Because alternative splicing of exons 44 and 47 in the P/Q-type VDCC α1 subunit CaV2.1 gene generates major variants of the CaV2.1 C-terminal region, known for associating with presynaptic proteins, we focused here on the protein regions encoded by these two exons. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments indicated that the C-terminal domain (CTD) encoded by CaV2.1 exons 40–47 interacts with the α-RIMs, RIM1α and RIM2α, and this interaction was abolished by alternative splicing that deletes the protein regions encoded by exons 44 and 47. Electrophysiological characterization of VDCC currents revealed that the suppressive effect of RIM2α on voltage-dependent inactivation (VDI) was stronger than that of RIM1α for the CaV2.1 variant containing the region encoded by exons 44 and 47. Importantly, in the CaV2.1 variant in which exons 44 and 47 were deleted, strong RIM2α-mediated VDI suppression was attenuated to a level comparable with that of RIM1α-mediated VDI suppression, which was unaffected by the exclusion of exons 44 and 47. Studies of deletion mutants of the exon 47 region identified 17 amino acid residues on the C-terminal side of a polyglutamine stretch as being essential for the potentiated VDI suppression characteristic of RIM2α.

The research was carried out on a selection of rescued fragments. The data revealed the use of egg proteins as the paint binders of the original layers, in accordance with the traditional use of this proteinaceous medium in antiquity, spanning from the Mediterranean basin to the Far East, and already in the Bronze Age. Egg tempera was thus known to artists of the region in the first centuries AD, probably also due to the position of the Bāmiyān valley, which was connected to the Silk Road. Milk was found in the first historical overpaintings. A new proteomics approach was used, which was able to identify the source of the milk proteins present in the restoration layers, despite their age and degradation. In particular cow's and goat's milk were both found, in agreement with the documented presence of rich pastures in the Bāmiyān valley when the historical restorations were carried out. Investigating the materials of the Giant Buddhas not only enabled us to obtain isolated data on these invaluable works of art, which are now lost, but contributes to understanding the big ""puzzle"" of our past and the development of our culture, by implementing and supporting written sources, stylistic and anthropological studies with molecular data."
https://openalex.org/W2605215901,"Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most commonly diagnosed non-cutaneous cancer. In the United States it is second leading cause of cancer related deaths in men. PCa is often treated via radical prostatectomy (RP). However, 15-30% of the patients develop biochemical recurrence (i.e. increased serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels). Interleukin-15 (IL-15) is a secreted cytokine found over expressed in patients with recurrence-free survival after RP. In our study, we aim to determine the role of IL-15 in PCa using in vitro and in vivo models, and gene expression analysis. PC3 (androgen-independent) and 22RV1 (androgen-dependent) cell lines were treated with IL-15 at 0.0013 ng/mL and 0.1 ng/mL. Tumor growth was evaluated using an orthotopic xenograft model. The anterior prostate lobes of SCID mice were injected with 250,000 22RV1 cells and IL-15 was administered bi-weekly with intraperitoneal (IP) injections during 4 weeks. Tumor tissue was collected for immunohistochemical and gene expression analysis. To study changes in gene expression, we looked at ""Tumor Metastasis"" and ""PI3K pathway"" using commercially available PCR arrays. In addition, we employed a microarray approach using the Affymetrix Hugene 2.0 ST array chip followed by analysis with Ingenuity Pathways Analysis (IPA) software. In vitro studies showed that IL-15 decreased PCa cell motility at both concentrations. In vivo studies showed that IL-15 increased neutrophil infiltration, and the expression of adiponectin, desmin and alpha smooth muscle actin (α-sma) in the tumor tissue. Angiogenesis analysis, using CD31 immunohistochemistry, showed that IL-15 decreased the number of blood vessels. Gene expression analysis identified Cancer, Cell Death, Immune Response and Lipid Metabolism as the major diseases and functions altered in tumors treated with IL-15. This suggests that IL-15 causes inflammation and changes in stroma that can promote decreased tumor cell proliferation."

The genetic lineage tracing of hepatocytes in previous works mainly depends on the Cre-expressing adeno-associated virus (AAV8) that specifically targets hepatocytes. Due to the unknown effect of excessive virus on the hepatocyte proliferation and also the duration of the Cre-expressing virus in hepatocytes, the virus-mediated lineage-tracing data should be interpreted with cautions. We, therefore, generated a hepatocyte-inducible tracing mouse line and directly labeled hepatocytes by tamoxifen induction and traced the change of hepatocyte-labeling efficiency under multiple liver injury conditions.

During liver development, albumin is specifically expressed in liver hepatoblasts (progenitors of both biliary epithelial cells (BECs) and hepatocytes). Its expression is restricted to mature hepatocytes in adult stage (15Kubota H. Reid L.M. Clonogenic hepatoblasts, common precursors for hepatocytic and biliary lineages, are lacking classical major histocompatibility complex class I antigen.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 12132-12137Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). We, therefore, utilize the Alb gene to generate a genetic tool for inducible lineage tracing of hepatocytes. We first generated Alb-DreER by knocking a cDNA encoding DreERT2 into the last coding exon of Alb using CRISPR/Cas9 through homologous recombination. This knock-in strategy leads to simultaneous expression of DreER and endogenous albumin. Dre is a site-specific recombinase that targets the rox site, and similar to Cre-loxP, Dre-rox recombination has also been used for genetic lineage tracing (16Zhang H. Pu W. Li G. Huang X. He L. Tian X. Liu Q. Zhang L. Wu S.M. Sucov H.M. Zhou B. Endocardium minimally contributes to coronary endothelium in the embryonic ventricular free walls.Circ.

Genetic lineage tracing identifies endocardial origin of liver vasculature.Nat. Genet. 2016; 48: 537-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). By crossing Alb-DreER with the R26-RSR-tdTomato reporter line (16Zhang H. Pu W. Li G. Huang X. He L. Tian X. Liu Q. Zhang L. Wu S.M. Sucov H.M. Zhou B. Endocardium minimally contributes to coronary endothelium in the embryonic ventricular free walls.Circ. Res. 2016; 118: 1880-1893Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 17Zhang H. Pu W. Liu Q.

Res. 2016; 118: 254-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), we generated Alb-DreER;R26-RSR-tdTomato mice and treated them with tamoxifen for induction of Dre-rox recombination (Fig. 1A). Dre-rox recombination will remove rox-flanked transcriptional Stop cassette, leading to tdTomato expression and cell labeling (Fig. 1B). This genetic labeling is heritable and irreversible so that all the descendants of Alb-expressing cells will permanently express the genetic marker tdTomato. In adult Alb-DreER;R26-RSR-tdTomato mice collected 4 days after tamoxifen induction, we observed Alb-DreER efficiently labeled cells in liver (Fig. 1C). Immunostaining for the genetic marker tdTomato, the biliary epithelial cell marker CK19, and hepatocyte marker HNF4α on liver sections showed that Alb-DreER labeled almost all hepatocytes but not BECs (Fig. 1D). To detect the leakiness of DreER, we collected the liver of Alb-DreER;R26-RSR-tdTomato mice that did not receive tamoxifen. Immunostaining for tdTomato and HNF4α on liver sections shows sparse tdTomato+ hepatocytes (Fig. 1D), indicating that a high labeling percentage of hepatocytes after tamoxifen induction is unlikely due to leakiness of DreER. Immunostaining for tdTomato and other non-hepatocyte lineage markers showed that Alb-DreER did not label Sox9+ or EpCAM+ biliary epithelia cells, Desmin+ hepatic stellate cells, PDGFRα+ fibroblasts, VE-cadherin+ vascular endothelial cells, or aSMA+ smooth muscle cells in the liver (Fig. 1E). Quantification data showed that 99.64 ± 0.15% of hepatocytes were tdTomato+ at 1 week after tamoxifen treatment. At 6 weeks after tamoxifen treatment, the percentage of tdTomato+ hepatocytes remained similar to that of 1 week (99.54 ± 0.19%, n = 4) (Fig. 1F). Taken together, our results demonstrated that Alb-DreER efficiently and specifically labels hepatocytes in adult mouse liver (Fig. 1G), and this genetic tool could be utilized to study the cell fate of hepatocytes after liver injuries. To test whether hepatocytes arise from progenitor cells after chronic liver injury, we labeled almost all hepatocytes using Alb-DreER;Rosa26-RSR-tdTomato mice to determine if most hepatocytes after injury are derived from pre-existing labeled hepatocytes. By using and-chase strategy, we reasoned that if unlabeled hepatic progenitor cells contribute to new hepatocytes after injury, these new hepatocytes would be unlabeled. If the number of unlabeled hepatocytes from progenitor cells is substantial, it would significantly dilute the labeling percentage of hepatocytes. If their contribution is negligible, we may not detect significant dilution of the labeled hepatocytes. We could, therefore, infer from these data that new hepatocytes are mainly derived from pre-existing hepatocytes or hepatic precursor cells. Next, we used this pulse-and-chase strategy to analyze the percentage of labeled hepatocytes during the liver regeneration after different types of injury models. The Alb-DreER;Rosa26-RSR-tdTomato mice were treated with CCl4 to induce chronic injury (Fig. 2A). Shortly after CCl4 treatment, we found a significant loss of hepatocytes in the pericentral region compared with fairly normal condition of hepatocytes in the periportal region (Fig. 2B). During chronic injury, periportal hepatocytes will migrate and compensate for the loss of pericentral hepatocytes (19Pu W. Zhang H. Huang X. Tian X. He L. Wang Y. Zhang L. Liu Q. Li Y. Li Y. Zhao H. Liu K. Lu J. et al.Mfsd2a+ hepatocytes repopulate the liver during injury and regeneration.Nat. Commun. 2016; 713369Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Sirius red staining confirmed a significant fibrosis in CCl4-treated liver compared with oil-treated liver (Control) or liver collected at 3-weeks' recovery after injury (Recovery) (Fig. 2C). Whole-mount epifluorescence view of livers from different groups shows no significant dilution of fluorescence signal after liver injury (Fig. 2D). Immunostaining for tdTomato, CK19, and HNF4α showed that almost all hepatocytes in the injured and control livers were tdTomato+ (Fig. 2E). By CCl4 treatment, we did not detect any BECs derived from tdTomato+ hepatocytes (Fig. 2E). To exclude that the high labeling efficiency in injured liver is not due to leakiness of DreER, we induced CCl4 in mice that did not receive tamoxifen (No Tam). We detected very sparsely labeled hepatocytes (Fig. 2, F and G), indicating that a high labeling percentage of hepatocytes before and after injury is unlikely due to leakiness of DreER. Quantification of HNF4α+ hepatocytes showed that there is no difference in the percentage of tdTomato+ hepatocytes between control, injury, and recovery groups (99.60 ± 0.11% versus 99.38 ± 0.19% versus 99.34 ± 0.075%, respectively, n = 4, Fig. 2H). The percentage of “leaky” tdTomato+ hepatocytes is negligible by quantification (Fig. 2H). Taken together, these results demonstrated that almost all hepatocytes in the injured liver are derived from pre-existing hepatocytes. Hepatic progenitor cells, if present, minimally contributed to new hepatocytes after injury. We further examined the contribution of pre-existing hepatocytes to newly generated hepatocytes in DDC-supplemented diet-induced liver damage models. The Alb-DreER;Rosa26-RSR-tdTomato mice were induced cholestatic injury with a DDC-containing diet (Fig. 3A). Sirius red staining of liver sections showed excessive fibrosis after injury (Fig. 3B). Whole-mount epifluorescence images of livers showed no significant drop of tdTomato+ signals in DDC-induced injury group compared with control or recovery groups (Fig. 3C). Immunostaining for tdTomato, CK19, and HNF4α showed that a significant ductal reaction in DDC-treated mouse liver and the surviving hepatocytes were almost all tdTomato+ (Fig. 3D). Quantification data showed that the percentage of tdTomato+ hepatocytes showed that there is no significant difference between control, DDC, and recovery groups (99.49 ± 0.071% versus 99.40 ± 0.096% versus 99.41 ± 0.19%, respectively, n = 4; Fig. 3E). These results indicate that pre-existing hepatocytes are the major source for new hepatocytes in DDC-induced liver injury. We next fed Alb-DreER;Rosa26-RSR-tdTomato mice with a CDE diet to induce liver injury (Fig. 4A). Sirius red staining showed significant fibrosis after CDE treatment (Fig. 4B). Whole-mount fluorescence showed that there is no significant dilution of tdTomato+ signal after injury (Fig. 4C). Immunostaining for tdTomato, CK19, and HNF4α showed an increased number of CK19+ BECs cells after injury, indicating ductal reaction. However, the labeling efficiency of hepatocytes still remains high in CDE liver compared with control or recovery (Fig. 4D). Quantification data confirmed that there is no significant difference of the tdTomato+ hepatocyte percentage between control, CDE, and recovery groups (99.58 ± 0.071% versus 99.46 ± 0.098% versus 99.48 ± 0.23%, respectively, n = 4; Fig. 4E). Taken together, these data showed that pre-existing hepatocytes are the major source for new hepatocytes after CDE-induced liver injury. Additionally, we fed Alb-DreER;Rosa26-RSR-tdTomato mice with an ANIT diet, another cholestatic liver injury model (Fig. 5A). Similarly, we used Sirius red staining to confirm the success of liver damage according to inflammatory infiltration and parenchymal necrosis (Fig. 5B). A whole-mount fluorescence view of livers showed no appreciable change in tdTomato+ signals from control, ANIT, and recovery groups (Fig. 5C). Immunostaining for tdTomato, CK19, and HNF4α showed that although there is increased CK19+ BECs during ductal reaction, efficiency of labeled hepatocytes remains similar between these three groups (Fig. 5D). Quantification data showed that there is no significant difference of the percentage of tdTomato+ hepatocytes between control, ANIT, and recovery groups (99.61 ± 0.081% versus 99.56 ± 0.14% versus 99.47 ± 0.18%, respectively, n = 4; Fig. 5E). Taken together, these data demonstrated that pre-existing hepatocytes are the major origin for new hepatocytes in ANIT-induced liver injury model. As a control, we performed mice surgeries to test the changes of adult hepatocytes. We designed 2/3 PHx using Alb-IRES-DreER;Rosa26-RSR-tdTomato mice and collected livers at different times (Fig. 6A). Sirius red staining showed that there was no fibrosis after PHx, indicating that the surgery is successful, and no other additional injuries were induced (Fig. 6B). Collecting livers from PHx mice proved the size became much larger than sham mice, demonstrating that the extent of hepatocyte proliferation is directly proportional to the amount of resected liver tissue (Fig. 6C). Immunostaining for tdTomato, CK19, and HNF4α showed that there is also no change in the tdTomato labeling index in both the short-time and long-time recovery (Fig. 6D). Quantification data showed that there is no significant difference of the percentage of tdTomato+ hepatocytes between sham and recovery groups (99.55 ± 0.21% versus 99.46 ± 0.25% versus 99.52 ± 0.18%, respectively, n = 4; Fig. 6E). Next, we operated on the Alb-DreER;Rosa26-RSR-tdTomato mice with bile BDL (Fig. 7A). Sirius red staining showed that there was serious fibrosis after BDL, indicating that the surgery is performed successfully (Fig. 7B). Collecting livers from sham mice or BDL-treated mice proved the severe bile duct injury (Fig. 7C). Immunostaining for tdTomato, CK19, and HNF4α showed that there is also no change in the tdTomato labeling percentage after mice recovery (Fig. 7D). Quantification data showed that there is no significant difference of the percentage of tdTomato+ hepatocytes between sham and recovery groups (99.58 ± 0.14% versus 99.60 ± 0.089%, respectively, n = 4; Fig. 7E). In this study we used lineage tracing approaches to test the source of hepatocytes after toxin- or surgery-induced liver damage and repair/regeneration. We genetically labeled albumin-expressing hepatocytes with high efficiency and specificity and found that there was no detectable change in labeling proportion with six mentioned types of injury in our research. Almost all hepatocytes were labeled after injury, similar to those labeled before injury. Taken together, our genetic lineage tracing data suggest that non-hepatocyte populations are unable to contribute significantly to hepatocyte neogenesis during liver repair and regeneration.

https://openalex.org/W2599550601,"Transcutaneous spinal direct current stimulation (tsDCS) is a non-invasive neuromodulatory intervention that has been shown to modify excitability in spinal and supraspinal circuits in animals and humans. Our objective in this study was to explore the functional neuromodulatory potential of tsDCS by examining its immediate and lasting effects over the repeated performance of a whole body maximal exercise in healthy volunteers. Using a double-blind, randomized, crossover, sham-controlled design we investigated the effects of 15 min of anodal tsDCS on repeated vertical countermovement jump (VCJ) performance at 0, 20, 60, and 180 minutes post-stimulation. Measurements of peak and take-off velocity, vertical displacement, peak power and work done during countermovement and push-off VCJ phases were derived from changes in vertical ground reaction force (12 performance parameters) in 12 healthy participants. The magnitude and direction of change in VCJ performance from pre- to post-stimulation differed significantly between sham and active tsDCS for 7 of the 12 VCJ performance measures (P < 0.05). These differences comprised of a post-sham fatigue in VCJ displacement/work done, peak to peak power and take-off velocity, and a resilience to this fatigue effect post-active tsDCS. In addition there was also an enhancement of countermovement performance and total work done (P < 0.05). These changes did not vary across repeated VCJ performances over time post-tsDCS (P > 0.05). Our original findings demonstrate that one single session of anodal tsDCS in healthy subjects can prevent fatigue and maintain or enhance different aspects of whole body explosive motor power over repeated sets of VCJs performed over a period of three hours. The observed effects are discussed in relation to alterations in central fatigue mechanisms, muscle contraction mode during jump execution and changes in spinal cord excitability. These findings have important implications for power endurance sport performance and for neuromotor rehabilitation."
https://openalex.org/W2604851831,"Coordinated regulation of innate immune responses is necessary in all metazoans. In Drosophila the Imd pathway detects Gram-negative bacterial infections through recognition of diaminopimelic acid (DAP)-type peptidoglycan and activation of the NF-κB precursor Relish, which drives robust antimicrobial peptide gene expression. Imd is a receptor-proximal adaptor protein homologous to mammalian RIP1 that is regulated by proteolytic cleavage and Lys-63-polyubiquitination. However, the precise events and molecular mechanisms that control the post-translational modification of Imd remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate that Imd is rapidly Lys-63-polyubiquitinated at lysine residues 137 and 153 by the sequential action of two E2 enzymes, Ubc5 and Ubc13-Uev1a, in conjunction with the E3 ligase Diap2. Lys-63-ubiquitination activates the TGFβ-activated kinase (Tak1), which feeds back to phosphorylate Imd, triggering the removal of Lys-63 chains and the addition of Lys-48 polyubiquitin. This ubiquitin-editing process results in the proteasomal degradation of Imd, which we propose functions to restore homeostasis to the Drosophila immune response."
https://openalex.org/W2605261628,"Background There is continuing public debate about treatment preferences at the end of life, and the acceptability and legal status of treatments that sustain or end life. However, most surveys use binary yes/no measures, and little is known about preferences in neurological disease when decision-making capacity is lost, as most studies focus on cancer. This study investigates changes in public preferences for care towards the end of life, with a focus on measures to sustain or end life. Methods Large-scale international public opinion surveys using a six-stage patient vignette, respondents chose a level of intervention for each stage as health and decision-making capacity deteriorated. Cross-sectional representative samples of the general public in Great Britain and the USA (N = 2016). Primary outcome measure: changes in respondents’ preferences for care, measured on a four-point scale designed before data collection. The scale ranged from: maintaining life at all costs; to intervention with agreement; to no intervention; to measures for ending life. Results There were no significant differences between GB and USA. Preference for measures to sustain life at all costs peaked at short-term memory loss (30.2%, n = 610). Respondents selecting ‘measures to help me die peacefully’ increased from 3.9% to 37.0% as the condition deteriorated, with the largest increase occurring when decision-making capacity was lost (10.3% to 23.0%). Predictors of choosing ‘measures to help me die peacefully’ at any stage were: previous personal experience (OR = 1.34, p<0.010), and older age (OR = 1.09 per decade, p<0.010). Negative predictors: living with children (OR = 0.72, p<0.010) and being of “black” race/ethnicity (OR = 0.45, p<0.001). Conclusions Public opinion was uniform between GB and USA, but markedly heterogeneous. Despite contemporaneous capacitous consent providing an essential legal safeguard in most jurisdictions, there was a high prevalence of preference for “measures to end my life peacefully” when decision-making capacity was compromised, which increased as dementia progressed. In contrast, a significant number chose preservation of life at all costs, even in end stage dementia. It is challenging to respect the longstanding values of people with dementia concerning either the inviolability of life or personal autonomy, whilst protecting those without decision-making capacity."
https://openalex.org/W2604162795,"Here we present a new species of placoderm fish, Africanaspis edmountaini sp. nov., and redescribe Africanaspis doryssa on the basis of new material collected from the type locality of Africanaspis. The new material includes the first head shields of Africanaspis doryssa in addition to soft anatomy for both taxa. Hitherto Africanaspis was entirely described from trunk armour and no record of body and fin outlines had been recorded. In addition the first record of embryonic and juvenile specimens of Africanaspis doryssa is presented and provides a growth series from presumed hatchlings to presumed adults. The presence of a greater number of juveniles compared to adults indicates that the Waterloo Farm fossil site in South Africa represents the first nursery site of arthrodire placoderms known from a cold water environment. The preservation of an ontogenetic series demonstrates that variation within the earlier known sample, initially considered to have resulted from ontogenetic change, instead indicates the presence of a second, less common species Africanaspis edmountaini sp. nov. There is some faunal overlap between the Waterloo Farm fossil site and faunas described from Strud in Belgium and Red Hill, Pennsylvania, in north America, supporting the concept of a more cosmopolitan vertebrate fauna in the Famennian than earlier in the Devonian."
https://openalex.org/W2605204264,"Identification of drug induced electrical instability of the heart curtails development, and introduction, of potentially proarrhythmic drugs. This problem usually requires complimentary contact based approaches such as patch-clamp electrophysiology combined with field stimulation electrodes to observe and control the cell. This produces data with high signal to noise but requires direct physical contact generally preventing high-throughput, or prolonged, phenotyping of single cells or tissues. Combining genetically encoded optogenetic control and spectrally compatible calcium indicator tools into a single adenoviral vector allows the analogous capability for cell control with simultaneous cellular phenotyping without the need for contact. This combination can be applied to single rodent primary adult cardiomyocytes, and human stem cell derived cardiomyocytes, enabling contactless small molecule evaluation for inhibitors of sodium, potassium and calcium channels suggesting it may be useful for early toxicity work. In pancreatic beta-cells it reveals the effects of glucose and the KATP inhibitor gliclazide."
https://openalex.org/W2604719926,"The global shipping network facilitates the transportation and introduction of marine and terrestrial organisms to regions where they are not native, and some of these organisms become invasive. South Africa was used as a case study to evaluate the potential for shipping to contribute to the introduction and establishment of marine and terrestrial alien species (i.e. establishment debt) and to assess how this varies across shipping routes and seasons. As a proxy for the number of species introduced (i.e. 'colonisation pressure') shipping movement data were used to determine, for each season, the number of ships that visited South African ports from foreign ports and the number of days travelled between ports. Seasonal marine and terrestrial environmental similarity between South African and foreign ports was then used to estimate the likelihood that introduced species would establish. These data were used to determine the seasonal relative contribution of shipping routes to South Africa's marine and terrestrial establishment debt. Additionally, distribution data were used to identify marine and terrestrial species that are known to be invasive elsewhere and which might be introduced to each South African port through shipping routes that have a high relative contribution to establishment debt. Shipping routes from Asian ports, especially Singapore, have a particularly high relative contribution to South Africa's establishment debt, while among South African ports, Durban has the highest risk of being invaded. There was seasonal variation in the shipping routes that have a high relative contribution to the establishment debt of the South African ports. The presented method provides a simple way to prioritise surveillance effort and our results indicate that, for South Africa, port-specific prevention strategies should be developed, a large portion of the available resources should be allocated to Durban, and seasonal variations and their consequences for prevention strategies should be explored further."
https://openalex.org/W2604881447,"Backgrounds The Enterovirus genus of the family of Picornaviridae consists of 9 species of Enteroviruses and 3 species of Rhinoviruses based on the latest virus taxonomy. Those viruses contribute significantly to respiratory and digestive disorders in human and animals. Out of 9 Enterovirus species, Enterovirus E-G are closely related to diseases affecting on livestock industry. While enterovirus infection has been increasingly reported in cattle and swine, the enterovirus infections in small ruminants remain largely unknown. Methods Virology, molecular and bioinformatics methods were employed to characterize a novel enterovirus CEV-JL14 from goats manifesting severe diarrhea with morbidity and mortality respectively up to 84% and 54% in China. Results CEV-JL14 was defined and proposed as a new Enterovirus species L within the genus of Enterovirus of the family Picornaviridae. CEV-JL14 had a complete genome sequence of 7461 nucleotides with an ORF encoding 2172 amino acids, and shared 77.1% of genomic sequence identity with TB4-OEV, an ovine enterovirus. Comparison of 5’-UTR and structural genes of CEV-JL14 with known Enterovirus species revealed highly genetic variations among CEV-JL14 with known Enterovirus species. VP1 nucleotide sequence identities of CEV-14 were 51.8%-53.5% with those of Enterovirus E and F, 30.9%-65.3% with Enterovirus G, and 43.8–51. 5% with Enterovirus A-D, respectively. CEV-JL14 was proposed as a novel species within the genus of Enterovirus according to the current ICTV demarcation criteria of enteroviruses. Conclusions CEV-JL14 clustered phylogenetically to neither Enterovirus E and F, nor to Enterovirus G. It was defined and proposed as novel species L within the genus of Enterovirus. This is the first report of caprine enterovirus in China, the first complete genomic sequence of a caprine enterovirus revealed, and the unveiling of significant genetic variations between ovine enterovirus and caprine enterovirus, thus broadening the current understanding of enteroviruses."
https://openalex.org/W2605118852,"To elucidate microscopic details of proton cancer therapy (PCT), we apply the simplest-level electron nuclear dynamics (SLEND) method to H+ + (H2O)1-6 at ELab = 100 keV. These systems are computationally tractable prototypes to simulate water radiolysis reactions—i.e. the PCT processes that generate the DNA-damaging species against cancerous cells. To capture incipient bulk-water effects, ten (H2O)1-6 isomers are considered, ranging from quasi-planar/multiplanar (H2O)1-6 to “smallest-drop” prism and cage (H2O)6 structures. SLEND is a time-dependent, variational, non-adiabatic and direct method that adopts a nuclear classical-mechanics description and an electronic single-determinantal wavefunction in the Thouless representation. Short-time SLEND/6-31G* (n = 1–6) and /6-31G** (n = 1–5) simulations render cluster-to-projectile 1-electron-transfer (1-ET) total integral cross sections (ICSs) and 1-ET probabilities. In absolute quantitative terms, SLEND/6-31G* 1-ET ICS compares satisfactorily with alternative experimental and theoretical results only available for n = 1 and exhibits almost the same accuracy of the best alternative theoretical result. SLEND/6-31G** overestimates 1-ET ICS for n = 1, but a comparable overestimation is also observed with another theoretical method. An investigation on H+ + H indicates that electron direct ionization (DI) becomes significant with the large virtual-space quasi-continuum in large basis sets; thus, SLEND/6-31G** 1-ET ICS is overestimated by DI contributions. The solution to this problem is discussed. In relative quantitative terms, both SLEND/6-31* and /6-31G** 1-ET ICSs precisely fit into physically justified scaling formulae as a function of the cluster size; this indicates SLEND’s suitability for predicting properties of water clusters with varying size. Long-time SLEND/6-31G* (n = 1–4) simulations predict the formation of the DNA-damaging radicals H, OH, O and H3O. While “smallest-drop” isomers are included, no early manifestations of bulk water PCT properties are observed and simulations with larger water clusters will be needed to capture those effects. This study is the largest SLEND investigation on water radiolysis to date."
https://openalex.org/W2604658745,"Background Zoonotic avian influenza poses a major risk to China, and other parts of the world. H5N1 has remained endemic in China and globally for nearly two decades, and in 2013, a novel zoonotic influenza A subtype H7N9 emerged in China. This study aimed to improve upon our current understanding of the spreading mechanisms of H7N9 and H5N1 by generating spatial risk profiles for each of the two virus subtypes across mainland China. Methods and findings In this study, we (i) developed a refined data set of H5N1 and H7N9 locations with consideration of animal/animal environment case data, as well as spatial accuracy and precision; (ii) used this data set along with environmental variables to build species distribution models (SDMs) for each virus subtype in high resolution spatial units of 1km2 cells using Maxent; (iii) developed a risk modelling framework which integrated the results from the SDMs with human and chicken population variables, which was done to quantify the risk of zoonotic transmission; and (iv) identified areas at high risk of H5N1 and H7N9 transmission. We produced high performing SDMs (6 of 8 models with AUC > 0.9) for both H5N1 and H7N9. In all our SDMs, H7N9 consistently showed higher AUC results compared to H5N1, suggesting H7N9 suitability could be better explained by environmental variables. For both subtypes, high risk areas were primarily located in south-eastern China, with H5N1 distributions found to be more diffuse and extending more inland compared to H7N9. Conclusions We provide projections of our risk models to public health policy makers so that specific high risk areas can be targeted for control measures. We recommend comparing H5N1 and H7N9 prevalence rates and survivability in the natural environment to better understand the role of animal and environmental transmission in human infections."
https://openalex.org/W2604841788,"Uveitis, an intraocular inflammatory disease, occurs mostly in young people and can result in the loss of socioeconomic capabilities. Silibinin has been shown to exert anti-inflammatory effects in human retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells. The present study investigated the anti-inflammatory effect of silibinin pretreatment on endotoxin-induced uveitis (EIU) in rats and the mechanisms by which it exerts these effects. Uveitis was induced via injection of lipopolysaccharides (LPS) into Lewis rats. Twenty-four hours after the LPS injection, histological examination showed that silibinin decreased inflammatory cell infiltration in the anterior segment of the eyes of LPS-treated rats. Analyses of the aqueous humor showed that silibinin decreased cell infiltration, protein concentration, nitric oxide (NO), and prostaglandin (PG)-E2 production. Western blot analysis indicated that silibinin decreased the expression of inducible NO synthase (iNOS), cyclooxygenase (COX-2), and phosphorylated IkB in the iris-ciliary body (ICB). Immunohistochemistry showed that silibinin decreased intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM-1) expression in the ICB. In addition, western blot analysis showed that silibinin attenuated the expression of iNOS, COX-2, ICAM-1, and nuclear p65 in LPS-treated RAW cells. In conclusion, silibinin pretreatment prevents EIU and the subsequent production of proinflammatory mediators and ICAM-1, at least in part, by blocking the NF-κB-dependent signaling pathway both in vivo and in vitro. These effects may contribute to the silibinin-mediated preventive effects on intraocular inflammatory diseases such as acute uveitis."
https://openalex.org/W2605117746,"The production of new generation of wood preservatives (without addition of a co-biocide) in combination with an exchange of wood poles on identical sites with high fungal inoculum, has resulted in an increase of premature failures of wood utility poles in the last decades. Wood destroying basidiomycetes inhabiting sites where poles have been installed, have developed resistance against wood preservatives. The objective of the in vitro studies was to identify a Trichoderma spp. with a highly antagonistic potential against wood destroying basidiomycetes that is capable of colonizing Cu-rich environments. For this purpose, the activity of five Trichoderma spp. on Cu-rich medium was evaluated according to its growth and sporulation rates. The influence of the selected Trichoderma spp. on wood colonization and degradation by five wood destroying basidiomycetes was quantitatively analyzed by means of dry weight loss of wood specimens. Furthermore, the preventative effect of the selected Trichoderma spp. in combination with four Cu-based preservatives was also examined by mass loss and histological changes in the wood specimens. Trichoderma harzianum (T-720) was considered the biocontrol agent with higher antagonistic potential to colonize Cu-rich environments (up to 0.1% CuSO4 amended medium). T. harzianum demonstrated significant preventative effect on wood specimens against four wood destroying basidiomycetes. The combined effect of T. harzianum and Cu-based wood preservatives demonstrated that after 9 months incubation with two wood destroying basidiomycetes, wood specimens treated with 3.8 kg m-3 copper-chromium had weight losses between 55–65%, whereas containers previously treated with T. harzianum had significantly lower weight losses (0–25%). Histological studies on one of the wood destroying basidiomycetes revealed typical decomposition of wood cells by brown-rot fungi in Cu-impregnated samples, that were notably absent in wood specimens previously exposed to T. harzianum. It is concluded that carefully selected Trichoderma isolates can be used for integrated wood protection against a range of wood destroying basidiomycetes and may have potential for integrated wood protection in the field."

However, many important biological samples reside in a liquid environment where it is difficult to accurately measure their physical properties. We show that by using a simple piece of glass tubing and some inexpensive off-the-shelf electronics, we can create a sensor that can measure the mass, volume, and density of microgram-sized biological samples in their native liquid environment. As a proof-of-concept, we use this sensor to measure mass changes in zebrafish embryos reacting to toxicant exposure, density changes in seeds undergoing rehydration and germination, and degradation rates of biomaterials used in medical implants. Since all objects have these physical properties, this sensor has immediate applications in a wide variety of different fields including developmental biology, toxicology, materials science, plant science, and many others."
https://openalex.org/W2604666287,"Guidelines for suggested intake of ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are limited in youth and rely primarily on age. However, body weight varies considerably within age classifications. The current analyses examined effects of body weight and body mass index (BMI) on fatty acid accumulation in 64 youth (7-14 years) with a diagnosed mood disorder in a double-blind randomized-controlled trial (2000mg ω-3 supplements or a control capsule) across 12 weeks. Weight and height were measured at the first study visit and EPA and DHA levels were determined using fasting blood samples obtained at both the first and end-of-study visits. In the ω-3 supplementation group, higher baseline body weight predicted less plasma accumulation of both EPA [B = -0.047, (95% CI = -0.077; -0.017), β = -0.54, p = 0.003] and DHA [B = -0.02, (95% CI = -0.034; -0.007), β = -0.52, p = 0.004]. Similarly, higher BMI percentile as well as BMI category (underweight, normal weight, overweight/obese) predicted less accumulation of EPA and DHA (ps≤0.01). Adherence to supplementation was negatively correlated with BMI percentile [B = -0.002 (95% CI = -0.004; 0.00), β = -0.44, p = 0.019], but did not meaningfully affect observed associations. As intended, the control supplement exerted no significant effect on plasma levels of relevant fatty acids regardless of youth body parameters. These data show strong linear relationships of both absolute body weight and BMI percentile with ω-3 PUFA accumulation in youth. A dose-response effect was observed across the BMI spectrum. Given increasing variability in weight within BMI percentile ranges as youth age, dosing based on absolute weight should be considered. Moreover, effects of weight should be incorporated into statistical models in studies examining clinical effects of ω-3 PUFAs in youth as well as adults, as weight-related differences in effects may contribute meaningfully to inconsistencies in the current literature.WHO International Clinical Trial Registry Platform NCT01341925 and NCT01507753."

It inhibits ribonucleotide reductase and reversibly arrests cells in S phase. However, high concentrations or prolonged treatment with low doses of HU can cause cell lethality. Although the cytotoxicity of HU may significantly contribute to its therapeutic effects, the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. We have previously shown that HU can induce cytokinesis arrest in the erg11-1 mutant of fission yeast, which has a partial defect in the biosynthesis of fungal membrane sterol ergosterol. Here, we report the identification of a new mutant in heme biosynthesis, hem13-1, that is hypersensitive to HU. We found that the HU hypersensitivity of the hem13-1 mutant is caused by oxidative stress and not by replication stress or a defect in cellular response to replication stress. The mutation is hypomorphic and causes heme deficiency, which likely sensitizes the cells to the HU-induced oxidative stress. Because the heme biosynthesis pathway is highly conserved in eukaryotes, this finding, as we show in our separate report, may help to expand the therapeutic spectrum of HU to additional pathological conditions.

Diverse therapeutic activities have been reported, which include antiviral, antibacterial, antitumor, and anti-inflammatory effects (1Spivak J.L. Hasselbalch H.

The therapeutic effects are generally believed to be due to the DNA damage, such as strand breaks, generated at collapsed DNA replication forks. Within the research laboratories, HU is commonly used to generate the replication stress in proliferating cells. Because of its reversible action on DNA replication, it is also used as a cell synchronization agent. HU can also be cytotoxic depending on the time of exposure and the drug concentrations that are used. However, the cell killing mechanisms underlying the cytotoxic effect of HU, particularly on the non-cycling cells, are poorly understood. hydroxyurea 2,2′-bipryidine coproporphyrinogen oxidase camptothecin 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescin diacetate DNA damage checkpoint 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine DNA replication checkpoint methyl methanesulfonate N-acetylcysteine propidium iodide protein kinase G ribonucleotide reductase reactive oxygen species sampangine. The primary cellular target of HU is the enzyme ribonucleotide reductase (RNR), which is required for furnishing dNTP precursors for DNA replication and repair (3Nordlund P. Reichard P. Ribonucleotide reductases.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2006; 75: 681-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar). RNR is a heterotetrameric enzyme composed of two large and two small subunits. Although the large subunits have both catalytic and allosteric regulation sites, the small subunit contains a diferric tyrosyl-free radical that is required for the catalysis. HU quenches the tyrosyl radical and therefore suppress the enzymatic activity of RNR (4Krakoff I.H. Brown N.C. Reichard P.

Consistent with the radical scavenger mechanism, HU resistance has been observed in cells that overexpress the small subunit of RNR and in cells that express a mutant RNR (6Sneeden J.L. Loeb L.A.

Because RNR is an essential enzyme required for cell survival, extensive research has been carried out to develop small molecule inhibitors that can be used in clinics for the treatment of cancers or other diseases (9Shao J. Zhou B. Chu B. Yen Y. Ribonucleotide reductase inhibitors and future drug design.Curr. Cancer Drug Targets. 2006; 6: 409-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). When treated with HU, the proliferating cells are arrested in the S phase. The primary cellular response to the HU-induced replication stress is the activation of the DNA replication checkpoint (DRC) (10Elledge S.J. Zhou Z. Allen J.B. Ribonucleotide reductase: regulation, regulation, regulation.Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 119-123Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 11Lopes M. Cotta-Ramusino C.

Fork reversal and ssDNA accumulation at stalled replication forks owing to checkpoint defects.Science. 2002; 297: 599-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar). The activated DRC stimulates the production of dNTPs, delays mitosis, and protects the perturbed forks from collapsing so that cells have sufficient time to accomplish the DNA replication before they divide. Consistent with its importance in genome integrity, the DRC signaling pathway is highly conserved among all eukaryotic organisms. Defects in the DRC cause aberrant mitosis and broken forks, which are likely the direct causes of cell lethality. To understand the molecular mechanism by which the checkpoint signaling is initiated at the replication forks (13Yue M. Zeng L. Singh A. Xu Y. Rad4 mainly functions in Chk1-mediated DNA damage checkpoint pathway as a scaffold protein in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe.PLoS One. 2014; 9e92936Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 14Bandhu A.

Ddc2 mediates Mec1 activation through a Ddc1- or Dpb11-independent mechanism.PLoS Genet. 2014; 10e1004136Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), we have been searching for new DRC mutants. Because the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe is an established model for studying the cellular mechanisms that are conserved in humans, we carried out a genetic screen looking for new S. pombe mutants that are sensitive to the replication stress induced by HU. This screen has identified several mutants that are highly sensitive to chronic treatment of HU. Interestingly, these mutants are not killed by aberrant mitosis or DNA damage that are commonly observed in DRC mutants but by previously unknown mechanisms. In a previous report, we showed that HU induces cytokinesis arrest in cells carrying a hypomorphic mutation in the erg11 gene, which encodes the enzyme sterol-14α-demethylase required for sterol biosynthesis (15Xu Y.J. Singh A. Alter G.M. Hydroxyurea induces cytokinesis arrest in cells expressing a mutated sterol-14alpha-demethylase in the ergosterol biosynthesis pathway.Genetics. 2016; 204: 959-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). In this study, we report the identification of a novel hem13-1 mutant in the heme biosynthesis pathway. Several lines of evidence are provided that strongly support that HU kills the mutant cells by generating oxidative stress, not by perturbed DNA replication or a DRC signaling defect. Because HU is a well established drug with multiple clinical implications, discovery of new cell-killing mechanisms may help to improve the HU-based chemotherapies or expand the therapeutic use of this clinically important drug. To understand the initiation process of the DRC signaling at perturbed replication forks (13Yue M. Zeng L. Singh A. Xu Y. Rad4 mainly functions in Chk1-mediated DNA damage checkpoint pathway as a scaffold protein in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe.PLoS One. 2014; 9e92936Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 14Bandhu A.

Ddc2 mediates Mec1 activation through a Ddc1- or Dpb11-independent mechanism.PLoS Genet. 2014; 10e1004136Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), we carried out a hus (HU-sensitive) screen in S. pombe (16Enoch T. Carr A.M. Nurse P. Fission yeast genes involved in coupling mitosis to completion of DNA replication.Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 2035-2046Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar) to identify new mutants that are sensitive to the replication stress induced by HU. After removal of the mutants with known mutations that are sensitive to HU by extensive genetic crossing, the newly screened hus mutants were transformed with S. pombe genomic DNA expression libraries carrying the ura4 marker. Yeast colonies grown on plates lacking uracil were replicated onto plates containing HU to screen the colonies with conferred HU resistance. The plasmids recovered from the HU-resistant yeast colonies were subjected to digestions with restriction enzymes and DNA sequencing to identify the mutated genes in the newly screened hus mutants. As a result, this screen has identified several new fission yeast mutants that are highly sensitive to HU. We have previously reported our characterization of one of the newly screened hus mutant erg11-1 (15Xu Y.J. Singh A. Alter G.M. Hydroxyurea induces cytokinesis arrest in cells expressing a mutated sterol-14alpha-demethylase in the ergosterol biosynthesis pathway.Genetics. 2016; 204: 959-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Here, we report our results with the second screened mutant that carries a novel mutation in hem13 whose gene product is the predicted enzyme coproporphyrinogen III oxidase required for the biosynthesis of heme (17Zagorec M. Buhler J.M. Treich I. Keng T. Guarente L. Labbe-Bois R. Isolation, sequence, and regulation by oxygen of the yeast HEM13 gene coding for coproporphyrinogen oxidase.J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9718-9724Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). Hem13 is an oxygen-requiring enzyme that catalyzes the aerobic oxidative decarboxylation of propionate groups of rings A and B of coproporphyrinogen-III (highlighted in Fig. 1B) (18Elder G.H. Evans J.O. Jackson J.R. Jackson A.H. Factors determining the sequence of oxidative decarboxylation of the 2- and 4-propionate substituents of coproporphyrinogen III by coproporphyrinogen oxidase in rat liver.Biochem. J. 1978; 169: 215-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). DNA sequencing identified a single C-to-T nucleotide mutation that results in a T263I amino acid change in the enzyme (Fig. 1C). This mutant was subsequently named hem13-1 (Fig. 1D). The hem13-1 mutant also carries a cold-sensitive phenotype (Fig. 1D, lower panels), which is consistent with the essential function of the gene discovered by a previous genome-wide deletion study (19Kim D.U. Hayles J. Kim D. Wood V. Park H.O. Won M. Yoo H.S. Duhig T. Nam M. Palmer G. Han S. Jeffery L. Baek S.T. Lee H. Shim Y.S. et al.Analysis of a genome-wide set of gene deletions in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe.Nat. Biotechnol. 2010; 28: 617-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar) and confirmed by our tetrad dissection (supplemental Fig. S1). Rad3 is the sensor protein kinase of the DRC in S. pombe and the ortholog of human ATR (Ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related) and Saccharomyces cerevisiae Mec1. The rad3 mutant is one of the most HU-sensitive mutants that has been reported in S. pombe so far and was therefore used as a control in this study. The HU sensitivity of our newly screened hem13-1 mutant is remarkable in that it is even more sensitive than the rad3 mutant (Fig. 1D, upper panels). To confirm the mutation, we cloned the hem13 gene from both wild-type and the hem13-1 mutant and expressed on a vector in S. pombe. Although the vector carrying the wild-type hem13 rescued both HU and cold sensitivities, the vector carrying the mutant hem13 did not (Fig. 1E). Similar results were obtained when the wild-type and the mutated enzymes were expressed in cells devoid of hem13 (supplemental Fig. S2A). We then integrated the mutation at the genomic leu1 locus in hem13Δ cells (supplemental Fig. S2B) or at the hem13 genomic locus in a wild-type strain. All integrants of the mutated gene showed identical HU and cold sensitivities as the original mutant such as the one shown in Fig. 1F. In contrast, integrants of wild-type hem13 using the same method behaved like the wild-type cells (Fig. 1F). Because the HU sensitivity of hem13-1 is so remarkable, we tested the HU from different manufacturers with different batch numbers and confirmed that the HU sensitivity was indeed caused by HU and not by impurities (data not shown). Together, we have identified a novel hem13-1 mutation that dramatically sensitizes S. pombe to HU. The remarkable HU sensitivity of the hem13-1 mutant as determined by the standard spot assay shown in Fig. 1D involves a chronic drug exposure of ∼3 days. To further investigate, we assessed the sensitivity of the mutant to acute HU treatment in liquid medium (16Enoch T. Carr A.M. Nurse P. Fission yeast genes involved in coupling mitosis to completion of DNA replication.Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 2035-2046Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). We found that similar to the previously reported erg11-1 mutant (15Xu Y.J. Singh A. Alter G.M. Hydroxyurea induces cytokinesis arrest in cells expressing a mutated sterol-14alpha-demethylase in the ergosterol biosynthesis pathway.Genetics. 2016; 204: 959-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), the hem13-1 mutant was relatively insensitive to acute HU treatment (Fig. 2A). Although the wild-type cells were able to survive in HU, which is consistent with the reversible S-phase arrest induced by HU, most of the rad3 cells died ≤3 h or approximately 1 cell cycle time. The majority of the hem13-1 cells were able to survive in HU during the 6-h treatment. However, unlike the wild-type cells that continued to grow in HU, cell growth of the hem13-1 mutant was completely suppressed. This result suggests that unlike the DRC mutant and wild-type cells, HU may stably arrest the cell cycle of the hem13-1 mutant, which eventually leads to the cell inviability. Because most of the HU-sensitive DRC mutants are also sensitive to DNA damage, we then examined the sensitivity of the hem13-1 mutant to DNA damage caused by methyl methanesulfonate (MMS), camptothecin (CPT), or UV light by standard spot assay. As shown in Fig. 2B and supplemental Fig. S3A, although the rad3 mutant was highly sensitive to all three DNA-damaging agents, the hem13-1 mutant was only minimally sensitive as compared with wild-type cells. Cds1 (CHK2/Rad53) and Chk1 are the major effector kinases of the DRC and the DNA-damage checkpoint (DDC) in S. pombe, respectively. Although the cells devoid of chk1 in the DDC pathway showed an intermediate sensitivity to the DNA-damaging agents as compared with rad3 cells, the cds1 mutant showed a minimal sensitivity similar to hem13-1. This suggests that the DDC signaling pathway may remain functional in the hem13-1 mutant. To provide the direct evidence, we examined the DDC signaling by monitoring the Rad3-dependent phosphorylation of Chk1 (Fig. 2C). In the presence of MMS, Chk1 was highly phosphorylated in wild-type cells, and the phosphorylation was dependent on Rad3, not on Cds1. Under similar conditions, phosphorylation of Chk1 was minimally affected in hem13-1 cells, which shows that in the presence of DNA damage, the signaling from Rad3 to Chk1 in the DDC pathway remains largely intact. It has been reported previously that the DDC is activated in the presence of HU that lacks a functional DRC, probably by DNA-strand breaks generated at the collapsed forks (20Lindsay H.D. Griffiths D.J. Edwards R.J. Christensen P.U. Murray J.M. Osman F. Walworth N. Carr A.M. S-phase-specific activation of Cds1 kinase defines a subpathway of the checkpoint response in Schizosaccharomyces pombe.Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 382-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). In support of this notion, Chk1 was highly phosphorylated in HU-treated cds1 mutant cells (Fig. 2D). Under similar conditions, Chk1 was minimally phosphorylated in HU-treated hem13-1 cells. This result strongly suggests that broken forks rarely occur in HU-treated hem13-1 mutant, and it is unlikely that broken forks cause the remarkable HU sensitivity. Next, we examined the DRC signaling from Rad3 to Mrc1 and Cds1 after HU treatment. As mentioned above, Cds1 is the major effector kinase of the DRC in S. pombe (20Lindsay H.D. Griffiths D.J. Edwards R.J. Christensen P.U. Murray J.M. Osman F. Walworth N. Carr A.M. S-phase-specific activation of Cds1 kinase defines a subpathway of the checkpoint response in Schizosaccharomyces pombe.Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 382-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Although Cds1 is directly activated by autophosphorylation of Thr328 in the activation loop, the autophosphorylation requires the phosphorylation of Thr11 by Rad3, which primes the autophosphorylation and autoactivation of the kinase (21Yue M.

Two-stage mechanism for activation of the DNA replication checkpoint kinase Cds1 in fission yeast.Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 990-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Therefore, phosphorylation of Cds1-Thr11 has been used as a reliable marker for DRC activation in S. pombe (21Yue M. Singh A. Wang Z. Xu Y.J. The phosphorylation network for efficient activation of the DNA replication checkpoint in fission yeast.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 22864-22874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 22Tanaka K. Boddy M.N. Chen X.B. McGowan C.H. Russell P.

Biol. 2001; 21: 3398-3404Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3A, phosphorylation of Cds1 was significantly increased in HU-treated wild-type cells. Interestingly, Cds1 phosphorylation was reduced significantly by ∼ 77% in the hem13-1 mutant cells, which suggests that the DRC signaling is seriously compromised. To further investigate the DRC signaling defect, we examined the Rad3-dependent phosphorylation of the DRC mediator Mrc1 (human Claspin). In the presence of HU, Rad3 phosphorylates two TQ motifs in S. pombe Mrc1 containing Thr645 and Thr653, which function redundantly in recruiting Cds1 to be phosphorylated by Rad3 (23Xu Y.J. Davenport M. Kelly T.J. Two-stage mechanism for activation of the DNA replication checkpoint kinase Cds1 in fission yeast.Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 990-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3B, Mrc1-Thr645, a representative of the two TQ motifs in Mrc1, was highly phosphorylated by Rad3 in HU-treated wild-type cells (compare wild type with the rad3 mutant). Under similar conditions, Mrc1 phosphorylation was significantly reduced in the hem13-1 cells. Interestingly, the protein levels of Mrc1 were also significantly lower, which may provide an explanation for the reduced phosphorylation of Mrc1 and Cds1. Because Mrc1 is specifically expressed during the S phase, it is also possible that the observed DRC signaling defect from Rad3 to Mrc1 and Cds1 is caused, as described below, by an alternative mechanism. Next, we performed the cell cycle analysis on the mutant by flow cytometry. In the presence of HU, most of the wild-type cells were arrested at the G1/S phase in ∼3–4 h and eventually finished the bulk of DNA synthesis in ∼7–8 h (Fig. 3C, left column). Under similar conditions, the hem13-1 cells were not arrested at the G1/S phase during the 8-h-long HU treatment. Instead, most of them remained with a 2C DNA content, which suggests a G2/M arrest (Fig. 3C, right column). In a standard HU block and release experiment, similar G2/M arrest was observed (supplemental Fig. S3B). Together, these results strongly suggest that HU arrests the hem13-1 cells in the G2/M phase and not in the G1/S phase of the cell cycle. Because Mrc1 and Cds1 are only active in the S phase during the cell cycle, the HU-induced G2/M arrest may provide an explanation for the reduced DRC signaling described above. To investigate this possibility, we crossed the hem13-1 mutation into a cdc10 ts mutant to generate the hem13-1 cdc10 double mutant. Cdc10 is a transcription factor required for G1/S transition (24Lowndes N.F. McInerny C.J. Johnson A.L. Fantes P.A. Johnston L.H. Control of DNA synthesis genes in fission yeast by the cell-cycle gene cdc10+.Nature. 1992; 355: 449-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) and expression of Mrc1 (23Xu Y.J. Davenport M. Kelly T.J. Two-stage mechanism for activation of the DNA replication checkpoint kinase Cds1 in fission yeast.Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 990-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) in S. pombe. Incubation of the cdc10 cells at the non-permissive temperature 36.5 °C blocks the cells at G1, which allows the release of the cells into the S phase in the presence of HU by incubating at the permissive temperature. In this way, almost all cells will be forced to enter the S phase in the presence of HU, which eliminates the indirect cell cycle effect caused by the G2/M arrest. As shown in Fig. 3D, when the cdc10 mutant and the cdc10 hem13-1 double mutant were incubated at 36.5 °C for 5 h, most of the cells were arrested in G1 and subsequently released into S in the presence of HU by incubating at 30 °C. The semipermissive temperature 30 °C was used because of the cold sensitivity of the hem13-1 mutant. In a separate experiment, the G1-arrested cdc10 and the cdc10 hem13-1 double-mutant cells were all able to efficiently release at 30 °C in the absence of HU (data not shown). During the course of this G1 block and release, Cds1 phosphorylation was monitored at the indicated time points (Fig. 3E). We found that when released into HU, Cds1 phosphorylation peaked at 4 h in the cdc10 or wild-type cells after the release. Under the similar conditions, Cds1 phosphorylation was also observed in the cdc10 hem13-1 double mutant, although the phosphorylation peaked at 3 h after the release or ∼1 h earlier than in cdc10 cells, which is likely due to the less stringent G1 arrest and the subsequently an earlier release caused by the hem13-1 mutation. We also examined the genetic interactions between hem13-1 and the known checkpoint mutations by crossing the mutation into rad3, chk1, and cds1 strains. The HU sensitivity of the resulting double mutants was examined and compared with that of the single mutants (Fig. 3F). We found that the double mutants were more sensitive to HU than the single checkpoint mutants but were similar to the hem13-1 mutant. This result suggests that hem13-1 is epistatic to the checkpoint mutants and is consistent with the predominant G2/M arrest caused by HU. These results, together with the data from the Suc22 rescuing experiment shown below, indicate that the observed DRC defect is likely an indirect effect of HU-induced G2/M arrest. Although the hem13-1 mutant is highly sensitive to chronic HU exposure, the mutant is relatively insensitive to acute HU treatment and the DNA-damaging agents. These results suggest that unlike the cell-killing mechanism that occurs in the checkpoint mutants, HU may kill the hem13-1 cells by an alternative mechanism. However, whether the reduced DRC signaling contributes to the cell killing remains unclear. To investigate this, we tested the effect of overexpressed RNR small subunit Suc22 in the hem13-1 cells (25Harris P. Kersey P.J. McInerny C.J. Fantes P.A. Cell cycle, DNA damage and heat shock regulate suc22+ expression in fission yeast.Mol. Gen. Genet. 1996; 252: 284-291PubMed Google Scholar). Because one of the major functions of the DRC is to stimulate RNR and to promote dNTP production and DNA synthesis, overexpression of Suc22 can fully rescue most of the DRC mutants, including the rad3 and cds1 mutants (Fig. 3G). Interestingly, overexpression of Suc22 did not rescue the hem13-1 mutant under similar conditions. Together, these results show that the reduced DRC signaling is likely an indirect cell cycle effect that contributes minimally to the HU-induced lethality in the hem13-1 mutant. The results described above strongly suggest that it is unlikely that broken forks or the reduced DRC signaling causes the cell death in hem13-1 mutant following HU treatment. Earlier studies suggest that in addition to broken forks, HU may also kill the cells by generating oxidative stress (26Davies B.W. Kohanski M.A. Simmons L.A. Winkler J.A. Collins J.J. Walker G.C.

Because of the potential defect in heme biosynthesis in hem13-1 cells, we surmised that the cell death induced by HU might be caused by accumulated ROS inside the mutant cells. To test this hypothesis, we examined HU sensitivity under anaerobic conditions because under aerobic growth conditions, mitochondria are the major source of intracellular ROS. We reasoned that if broken forks directly kill the cells, the cell death should occur in both checkpoint mutants and the hem13-1 mutant, regardless of the growth conditions. Cons"
https://openalex.org/W2604689326,"In this paper we explore the results of a large-scale online game called 'the Great Language Game', in which people listen to an audio speech sample and make a forced-choice guess about the identity of the language from 2 or more alternatives. The data include 15 million guesses from 400 audio recordings of 78 languages. We investigate which languages are confused for which in the game, and if this correlates with the similarities that linguists identify between languages. This includes shared lexical items, similar sound inventories and established historical relationships. Our findings are, as expected, that players are more likely to confuse two languages that are objectively more similar. We also investigate factors that may affect players' ability to accurately select the target language, such as how many people speak the language, how often the language is mentioned in written materials and the economic power of the target language community. We see that non-linguistic factors affect players' ability to accurately identify the target. For example, languages with wider 'global reach' are more often identified correctly. This suggests that both linguistic and cultural knowledge influence the perception and recognition of languages and their similarity."
https://openalex.org/W2604767427,"There is some evidence to suggest that chewing gum reduces chronic stress. However, it remains controversial how the taste and odour properties of chewing gum influence stress. The present study was designed to investigate this issue in human subjects. Using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, we tested salivary cortisol concentration, which is thought to be a stress marker, in 96 adults who chewed gum with different combinations of taste and odour. Subjects could discriminate between the types of gum without prior information. Salivary cortisol concentrations were highest and lowest for the subjects who chewed the most flavourful gum and the least flavourful gum, respectively. These findings suggest that the salivary cortisol level during gum chewing is not a marker of negative emotions (i.e., stressful conditions) as traditionally considered but, rather, an index of positive emotions that can facilitate biological responses to overcome stressful conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2604782506,"Male courtship display is common in many animals; in some cases, males engage in courtship indiscriminately, spending significant time and energy courting heterospecifics with whom they have no chance of mating or producing viable offspring. Due to high costs and few if any benefits, we might expect mechanisms to evolve to reduce such misdirected courtship (or 'reproductive interference'). In Habronattus jumping spiders, males frequently court heterospecifics with whom they do not mate or hybridize; females are larger and are voracious predators, posing a severe risk to males who court indiscriminately. In this study, we examined patterns of misdirected courtship in a natural community of four sympatric Habronattus species (H. clypeatus, H. hallani, H. hirsutus, and H. pyrrithrix). We used direct field observations to weigh support for two hypotheses (differential microhabitat use and species recognition signaling) to explain how these species reduce the costs associated with misdirected courtship. We show that, while the four species of Habronattus do show some differences in microhabitat use, all four species still overlap substantially, and in three of the four species individuals equally encountered heterospecifics and conspecifics. Males courted females at every opportunity, regardless of species, and in some cases, this led to aggression and predation by the female. These results suggest that, while differences in microhabitat use might reduce misdirected courtship to some extent, co-existence of these four species may be possible due to complex communication (i.e. species-specific elements of a male's courtship display). This study is the first to examine misdirected courtship in jumping spiders. Studies of misdirected courtship and its consequences in the field are limited and may broaden our understanding of how biodiversity is maintained within a community."
https://openalex.org/W2604482415,"Climate change and water extraction may result in increased exposition of the biota to ultraviolet-B radiation (UVB) in high-altitude Andean lakes. Although exposition to lethal doses in these lakes is unlikely, sub-lethal UVB doses may have strong impacts in key compartments such as zooplankton. Here, we aimed at determining the effect of sub-lethal UVB doses on filtration rates of two cladoceran species (Daphnia pulicaria and Ceriodaphnia dubia). We firstly estimated the Incipient Limiting Concentration (ILC) and the Gut Passage Time (GPT) for both species. Thereafter we exposed clones of each species to four increasing UVB doses (treatments): i) DUV-0 (Control), ii) DUV-1 (0.02 MJ m2), iii) DUV-2 (0.03 MJ m2) and iv) DUV-3 (0.15 MJ m2); and estimated their filtration rates using fluorescent micro-spheres. Our results suggest that increasing sub-lethal doses of UVB radiation may strongly disturb the structure and functioning of high-altitude Andean lakes. Filtration rates of D. pulicaria were not affected by the lowest dose applied (DUV-1), but decreased by 50% in treatments DUV-2 and DUV-3. Filtration rates for C. dubia were reduced by more than 80% in treatments DUV-1 and DUV-2 and 100% of mortality occurred at the highest UVB dose applied (DUV-3)."

The concept of the perfect matrix of Lagrange differences, its parameters, the construction of the load function and the corresponding optimization problem, the introduction of internal and external smoothing, embedding of the scalar parameter time series into the phase plane-all these computational techniques allow visualization of complex dynamical processes taking place in the cardiovascular system during the load and the recovery processes. Detailed analysis is performed with one person's RR and JT records only-but the presented techniques open new possibilities for novel interpretation of the dynamics of the cardiovascular system."
https://openalex.org/W2604999643,"Next-generation sequencing technology is rapidly transforming the landscape of evolutionary biology, and has become a cost-effective and efficient means of collecting exome information for non-model organisms. Due to their taxonomic diversity, production of interesting venom and silk proteins, and the relative scarcity of existing genomic resources, spiders in particular are excellent targets for next-generation sequencing (NGS) methods. In this study, the transcriptomes of six entelegyne spider species from three genera (Cicurina travisae, C. vibora, Habronattus signatus, H. ustulatus, Nesticus bishopi, and N. cooperi) were sequenced and de novo assembled. Each assembly was assessed for quality and completeness and functionally annotated using gene ontology information. Approximately 100 transcripts with evidence of homology to venom proteins were discovered. After identifying more than 3,000 putatively orthologous genes across all six taxa, we used comparative analyses to identify 24 instances of positively selected genes. In addition, between ~ 550 and 1,100 unique orphan genes were found in each genus. These unique, uncharacterized genes exhibited elevated rates of amino acid substitution, potentially consistent with lineage-specific adaptive evolution. The data generated for this study represent a valuable resource for future phylogenetic and molecular evolutionary research, and our results provide new insight into the forces driving genome evolution in taxa that span the root of entelegyne spider phylogeny."
https://openalex.org/W2605265584,"Background High-sensitive cardiac troponin T (hsTnT) is a sensitive biomarker of myocardial damage and predictor of acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF). However, there is little information on changes over time in hsTnT level during ADHF management. The aim of this prospective study was to evaluate changes in hsTnT levels between admission and at discharge in patients with ADHF, and identify factors that determine such levels and their prognostic significance. Methods and results We evaluated 404 ADHF patients with abnormal hsTnT levels (≥0.0135 ng/ml) on admission. The median (interquartile ranges) hsTnT levels on admission, at discharge, and percent changes in hsTnT levels were 0.038 (0.026 to 0.065), 0.032 (0.021 to 0.049) ng/ml, and -12.0 (-39.8 to 7.4) % respectively. The numbers of patients with falling (hsTnT decrease > -15%), stable (hsTnT change between -15 and +15%) and rising (hsTnT increase > +15%) hsTnT level at discharge were 190, 146, and 68, respectively. The percent change in B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels was greater in the falling group, compared to the stable (p<0.001) and rising groups (p<0.001). Changes in hsTnT levels correlated significantly with changes in BNP levels (ρ = 0.22, p<0.001). Multivariate Cox regression analysis identified rising or stable hsTnT at discharge as a significant predictor of heart failure-related rehospitalization (hazard ratio: 1.69; 95% confidence interval: 1.06 to 2.70; p = 0.03). Conclusions Persistent increase in hsTnT levels at discharge correlated with inadequate decrease of BNP levels, and was a predictor of poor clinical outcome, with repeat heart failure hospitalizations."
https://openalex.org/W2604193425,"Spatial integration of visual stimuli is a crucial step in visual information processing yet it is often unclear where this integration takes place in the visual system. In the superficial layers of the superior colliculus that form an early stage in visual information processing, neurons are known to have relatively small visual receptive fields, suggesting limited spatial integration. Here it is shown that at least for rats this conclusion may be wrong. Extracellular recordings in urethane-anaesthetized young adult rats (1.5-2 months old) showed that large stimuli of over 10° could evoke detectable responses well outside the borders of 'classical' receptive fields determined by employing 2° - 3.5° stimuli. The presence of responses to large stimuli well outside these 'classical' receptive fields could not be explained neither by partial overlap between the visual stimulus and the receptive field, nor by reflections or light dispersion from the stimulation site. However, very low frequency (<0.1 Hz) residual responses to small stimuli presented outside the receptive field may explain the obtained results if we assume that the frequency of action potentials during a response to a stimulus outside RF is proportional to the stimulus area. Thus, responses to large stimuli outside RF may be predicted by scaling according to the stimulus area of the responses to small stimuli. These data demonstrate that neurons in the superficial layers of the superior colliculus are capable of integrating visual stimuli over much larger area than it can be deduced from the classical receptive field."
https://openalex.org/W2604209266,"Fish and marine animals are important components of the subsistence diet of Alaska Native people, resulting in a high ω3 PUFA intake. The historical record for circumpolar populations highlights a tendency for facile bleeding, possibly related to ω3 PUFA effects on platelet activation and/or vitamin K-dependent clotting factors. To evaluate these two scenarios in Yup’ik people of southwestern Alaska, we examined the association between dietary ω3 PUFA intake and activities of clotting factor II, V, fibrinogen, PT, INR, PTT, and sP-selectin in 733 study participants, using the nitrogen isotope ratio of red blood cells as a biomarker of ω3 PUFA consumption. sP-selectin alone correlated strongly and inversely with ω3 PUFA consumption. Approximately 36% of study participants exhibited PIVKA-II values above the threshold of 2 ng/ml, indicative of low vitamin K status. To assess genetic influences on vitamin K status, study participants were genotyped for common vitamin K cycle polymorphisms in VKORC1, GGCX and CYP4F2. Only CYP4F2*3 associated significantly with vitamin K status, for both acute (plasma vitamin K) and long-term (PIVKA-II) measures. These findings suggest: (i) a primary association of ω3 PUFAs on platelet activation, as opposed to vitamin K-dependent clotting factor activity, (ii) that reduced CYP4F2 enzyme activity associates with vitamin K status. We conclude that high ω3 PUFA intake promotes an anti-platelet effect and speculate that the high frequency of the CYP4F2*3 allele in Yup’ik people (~45%) evolved in response to a need to conserve body stores of vitamin K due to environmental limitations on its availability."
https://openalex.org/W2604376281,"To gain insight into the relationship between protein structure and mechanical stability, single molecule force spectroscopy experiments on proteins with diverse structure and topology are needed. Here, we measured the mechanical stability of extender domains of two bacterial adhesins MpAFP and MhLap, in an atomic force microscope. We find that both proteins are remarkably stable to pulling forces between their N- and C- terminal ends. At a pulling speed of 1 μm/s, the MpAFP extender domain fails at an unfolding force Fu = 348 ± 37 pN and MhLap at Fu = 306 ± 51 pN in buffer with 10 mM Ca2+. These forces place both extender domains well above the mechanical stability of many other β-sandwich domains in mechanostable proteins. We propose that the increased stability of MpAFP and MhLap is due to a combination of both hydrogen bonding between parallel terminal strands and intra-molecular coordination of calcium ions."
https://openalex.org/W2604700456,"Embodied cognition posits that abstract conceptual knowledge such as mental representations of time and space are at least partially grounded in sensorimotor experiences. If true, then the execution of whole-body movements should result in modulations of temporal and spatial reference frames. To scrutinize this hypothesis, in two experiments participants either walked forward, backward or stood on a treadmill and responded either to an ambiguous temporal question (Experiment 1) or an ambiguous spatial question (Experiment 2) at the end of the walking manipulation. Results confirmed the ambiguousness of the questions in the control condition. Nevertheless, despite large power, walking forward or backward did not influence the answers or response times to the temporal (Experiment 1) or spatial (Experiment 2) question. A follow-up Experiment 3 indicated that this is also true for walking actively (or passively) in free space (as opposed to a treadmill). We explore possible reasons for the null-finding as concerns the modulation of temporal and spatial reference frames by movements and we critically discuss the methodological and theoretical implications."
https://openalex.org/W2605321227,"Since the adoption of some ambiguous and quantitative characters in Flora Republicae Popularis Sinicae 3(1), species identifications of the series Gravesiana have been in disarray, requiring clarification. Two hundred and fifty-nine individuals from 47 different populations were collected for the estimation of morphological characters and phylogenetic analyses. Spores of 26 populations were observed through scanning electron microscope. Our results were different from those of previous research: (1) six identifiable species, rather than five species observed previously, were confirmed in the series Gravesiana, they are A. gravesii, A. juxtapositum, A. mariesii, A. dentatum, A. longzhouensis and A. obovatum, of which the latter three are newly recognized species. (2) Thirteen characters were measured and estimated through the program Mesquite v. 2.71. The character whether the pinna stalks were 1/3-1/2 times longer than the pinna was used to distinguish A. gravesii and A. lianxianense previously and was found to be unreliable here, whereas such characters as the height of the plant (H), pinna aligned forms (FP), number of pinna (NP), pinna margin (M), number of veins flabellate at base (NV), sori number and shape per pinna (NSS), pinna texture (T), and powder-covered or not on the abaxial surface of the pinna (P) are estimated to be stable and reliable characters useful for identification. Descriptions of new species and their retrieve keys are also listed. (3) Surface ornamentations and spore sizes are helpful for us to distinguish species in series Gravesiana."
