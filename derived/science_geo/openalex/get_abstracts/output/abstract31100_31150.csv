https://openalex.org/W1976232165,"The 2.8 Å resolution three-dimensional structure of a complex between an antigen (lysozyme) and the Fab fragment from a monoclonal antibody against lysozyme has been determined and refined by x-ray crystallographic techniques. No conformational changes can be observed in the tertiary structure of lysozyme compared with that determined in native crystalline forms. The quaternary structure of Fab is that of an extended conformation. The antibody combining site is a rather flat surface with protuberances and depressions formed by its amino acid side chains. The antigen-antibody interface is tightly packed, with 16 lysozyme and 17 antibody residues making close contacts. The antigen contacting residues belong to two stretches of the lysozyme polypeptide chain: residues 18 to 27 and 116 to 129. All the complementarity-determining regions and two residues outside hypervariable positions of the antibody make contact with the antigen. Most of these contacts (10 residues out of 17) are made by the heavy chain, and in particular by its third complementarity-determining region. Antigen variability and antibody specificity and affinity are discussed on the basis of the determined structure."

https://openalex.org/W1988297300,"The extracellular matrix protein tenascin (previously described as myotendinous antigen) is selectively present in the mesenchyme surrounding fetal rat mammary glands, hair follicles, and teeth, three organ anlagen where the mesenchyme is essential for development. No tenascin is detectable in the normal adult mammary gland. Carcinogen-induced mammary tumors contained tenascin in their fibrous tissue. As reported for the molecule described as a ""hexabrachion,"" tenascin contaminates so-called ""cell-surface fibronectin,"" where it accounts for most of the detectable hemagglutinating activity. Of the extracellular matrix proteins compared, tenascin is the least effective substrate for attachment of primary mammary tumor cells, but the most effective in promoting cell growth after serum is removed from the culture medium."

https://openalex.org/W2045984686,"Analysis of the in vitro splicing products of RNA precursors containing tandem duplications of the 5' or 3' splice sites of human beta-globin IVS 1 revealed that exon sequences play an important role in the relative use of the duplicated sites. These studies also show that the proximity of the 5' and 3' splice sites is an important determinant in the selection of splice-sites. Deletion, substitution, or even subtle changes of exon sequences can alter the pattern of splice-site selection, and in many cases the splice site adjacent to the altered exon is not used. The relative use of the duplicated splice sites can also be altered by diluting the splicing extract, suggesting that factors involved in splice-site selection are limiting."

https://openalex.org/W2061806013,"The antigen receptor complex on murine MHC class II-restricted T cells consists of disulfide-linked α and β chains noncovalently associated with four additional polypeptides, two that are endoglycosaminidase F-sensitive, gp26 and gp21, and two that are endoglycosaminidase F-resistant, p25 and p16. We demonstrate here that treatment of murine T cell hybridomas with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate results in phosphorylation of p25 and gp21 on serine residues. However, activation of cells by antigen results in the phosphorylation of the gp21 chain and a heretofore unidentified 21 kd protein. This newly defined polypeptide, p21, is specifically immunoprecipitated with the antigen receptor complex, is endoglycosaminidase F-resistant, and is itself part of a disulfide-linked molecule. Unlike antigen-induced phosphorylation of gp21, which occurs on serine residues, phosphorylation of p21 occurs uniquely on tyrosine residues."

Survival and function of the transplanted hepatocytes have been demonstrated in mutant rats lacking bilirubin-uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase activity (Gunn strain) and rats with inherited lack of plasma albumin (Nagase analbuminemia rat strain). This simple technique promises to be useful in the treatment of acute liver failure in humans."

https://openalex.org/W1573237423,"One isoform of the regulatory subunit of type II cAMP-dependent protein kinase (R-II51; Mr = 51,000) and its electrophoretic variants (R-II51.5 and R-II52; Mr = 51,500 and 52,000, respectively) are selectively induced by estradiol and follicle-stimulating hormone (cAMP) in rat ovarian granulosa cells. To ascertain the amino acid sequence of R-II51 and to gain insight into the molecular events regulating the intracellular content of ovarian follicular R-II51, we constructed a lambda gt11 cDNA expression library from poly(A)+ RNA of hormone-primed rat granulosa cells. A 1.5-kilobase (kb) cDNA insert, isolated from a plaque-purified R-II antibody positive bacteriophage clone, selectively bound R-II51 mRNA as demonstrated by analysis of the hybrid-selected translation product. Restriction maps and sequence analyses of the 1.5-kb cDNA insert and of the 1.8- and 2.2-kb cDNA inserts from two additional clones showed overlapping sequences which span a region of 3065 nucleotides in size. The 1.5- and 1.8-kb cDNA inserts each contained poly(A) addition signals (1508 and 1761 nucleotides, respectively), terminal poly(A) sequences, and the entire coding region for R-II51 (1204 nucleotides) except for a small number of nucleotides at the 5' end. The 2.2-kb cDNA insert contained 394 nucleotides of the coding region a long 3' untranslated region and two more poly(A) addition signals (3041 and 3059 nucleotides). An amino acid microsequence surrounding the autophosphorylation site of pure rat ovarian R-II51 agreed with the amino acid sequence deduced from the nucleotide sequence of the cDNA. Northern blot analyses demonstrated two major mRNA species (1.8 and 3.2 kb in size) in hormone-primed rat ovaries which were approximately 10- and 50-fold greater than the R-II mRNA content in rat brain and rat heart, respectively. Southern blot analysis of rat liver DNA indicated that a single gene codes for R-II51 mRNA. Structural differences among rat ovarian R-II51, rat heart R-II54, and the known amino acid sequences of bovine R-II and R-I subunits also indicate that the rat ovarian R-II51 subunit is the product of a distinct gene."
https://openalex.org/W2053517688,"Selective cleavage of U4 or U6 RNA in a HeLa cell nuclear extract inhibits splicing of pre-mRNAs containing an adenovirus or a simian virus 40 intron. RNAs in the U4/U6 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) were specifically degraded with RNAase H and deoxyoligonucleotides. Two oligomers complementary to U4 RNA and two complementary to U6 RNA cleave their target RNAs and inhibit the appearance of both spliced products and reaction intermediates. Splicing is reconstituted by mixing an extract containing cleaved U4 or U6 RNA with one in which splicing has been inhibited by degrading U2 RNA. All four abundant snRNPs, containing U1, U2, U5, or U4 and U6 RNAs, are now implicated in pre-mRNA splicing. Possible interactions of the U4/U6 snRNP with other components of the splicing complex are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2000713154,"The requirement for individual U RNAs in splicing and polyadenylation was investigated using oligonucleotide-directed cleavage of snRNAs in in vitro processing extracts. Cleavage of U1, U2, or U4 RNA inhibited splicing but not polyadenylation of short precursor RNAs. Thus each snRNA and the snRNP in which it is assembled participates in the splicing reaction. Splicing activity was recovered when extracts containing cleaved U RNAs were mixed in pairwise combinations, indicating that U1, U2, and U4/U6 snRNPs independently interact with the assembling spliceosome. The involvement of multiple snRNPs in the splicing of simple precursor RNAs suggests that the spliceosome is a large complex assembly consisting of multiple snRNPs whose activity is dependent on the structural integrity of the individual U RNAs."

https://openalex.org/W1489116922,"Down regulation of phorbol diester receptors was studied with respect to proteolysis of protein kinase C, which is activated by Ca2+, phospholipids, and diacylglycerols and which binds to phorbol diesters. We used FRSK cells, a cell line derived from fetal rat skin keratinocytes, because in these cells specific binding of phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate decreased rapidly (50% decrease in 30 min). This decrease (down regulation) was inhibited by some protease inhibitors, such as N-tosyl-L-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone (TPCK), N-p-tosyl-L-lysine chloromethyl ketone (TLCK), and leupeptin, but not by inhibitors of lysosomal hydrolases. On treatment with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate, protein kinase C was rapidly translocated from the cytosol to the membranes and then decreased. This decrease in protein kinase C was also inhibited by TPCK, TLCK, and leupeptin. The decrease in membrane activity of protein kinase C was associated with increase in cytosolic activity of a protein kinase that was smaller in molecular weight (Mr 40,000-60,000) than protein kinase C, did not depend on Ca2+/phosphatidylserine/diacylglycerol, and did not bind to phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate. These results indicate that down regulation of phorbol diester receptors is probably caused by nonlysosomal proteolysis of protein kinase C. The kinase formed by cleavage may be an active catalytic site of protein kinase C."
https://openalex.org/W1579774371,"Hepatic poly(A+) RNA from rats induced for stearyl-CoA desaturase was used for primer-extension of cDNA coding for stearyl-CoA desaturase. Previously, Northern blot analysis showed that translatable desaturase mRNA is 4,900 nucleotides in length (Thiede, M. A., and Strittmatter, P. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 14459-14463). Six overlapping cDNAs, ranging from 850 to 1450 bases, were used to compile the 4,689-nucleotide sequence. The cDNA includes a 1,074-base open reading frame coding for 358 amino acids, corresponding to a molecular mass of 41,400 daltons. Positive identification of this open reading frame was accomplished by matching the amino acid sequence of both amino-terminal and cyanogen bromide peptides of the purified enzyme with regions of the sequence deduced from the cDNA. Amino acid composition data from the cDNA compares well with that from the desaturase. The protein contains 62% hydrophobic amino acids. An interesting feature of this mRNA is the 3,500-base 3' noncoding region, which has been localized on a single 3' exon by Southern blot analysis."

Ion channel activities were recorded from spheroplasts or patches of plasma membrane with the patch-clamp technique. The most prominent activities came from a set of potassium channels with the properties of activation by positive but not negative voltages, high selectivity for potassium over sodium ion, unit conductance of 20 picosiemens, inhibition by tetraethylammonium or barium ions, and bursting kinetics."
https://openalex.org/W2052776530,"Cardiac gap junctions consist of arrays of integral membrane proteins joined across the intercellular cleft at points of cell-to-cell contact. These junctional proteins are thought to form pores through which ions can diffuse from cytosol to cytosol. By monitoring whole-cell currents in pairs of embryonic heart cells with two independent patch-clamp circuits, the properties of single gap junction channels have been investigated. These channels had a conductance of about 165 picosiemens and underwent spontaneous openings and closings that were independent of voltage. Channel activity and macroscopic junctional conductance were both decreased by the uncoupling agent 1-octanol."
https://openalex.org/W2051116783,"Formation of the primer for ColE1 DNA replication from the primary transcript, RNA II, is regulated by an antisense transcript, RNA I. Exposure of elongating RNA II 100-360 nucleotides long to RNA I inhibits subsequent primer formation. However, primer forms normally for transcripts longer than 360 nucleotides. Therefore, the rate of binding of RNA I to RNA II is crucial to regulation. The binding rate varies among RNA II transcripts of different lengths. Transcripts longer than 200 nucleotides are bound faster than shorter ones. The Rom protein enhances binding of RNA I to these longer transcripts, whereas it suppresses binding to some shorter ones. The insensitivity to RNA I of transcripts longer than 360 nucleotides is not due to the absence of RNA I binding but to this binding having no effect on primer formation."
https://openalex.org/W1562035843,"The human neuropeptide Y (NPY) gene was isolated from a human genomic DNA library. The transcription unit spans approximately 8 kilobase pairs and is interrupted by three intervening sequences. The first exon contains only nontranslated DNA. The site where transcription initiates was determined by primer extension analysis using a primer derived from a human cDNA, pheochromocytoma RNA and avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase. A TATA-like sequence and a CAAT-like sequence occur 25 and 70 base pairs 5' to the transcription start site, respectively. The second exon begins with the initiator Met for preproNPY and extends to the Arg (residue 63) which precedes the Tyr-amide of mature NPY. The third exon contains the coding region for 27 amino acids, and the fourth exon codes for the terminal heptapeptide and the 3' nontranslated DNA. Transcriptional control elements were investigated by fusing 581 base pairs of the 5' sequences of the NPY gene to the promoterless structural gene for chloramphenicol acetyltransferase. NPY promoter activity was assayed by transfection of these hybrid constructions into CA-77 and PC12 cells followed by the determination of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity in cellular extracts. DNA sequences located within 530 bases of the start of transcription are sufficient for transient expression in the two neuronally derived cell lines examined."
https://openalex.org/W1540509084,"Calcium (Ca2+) is sequestered into vacuoles of oat root cells through a H+/Ca2+ antiport system that is driven by the proton-motive force of the tonoplast H+-translocating ATPase. The antiport has been characterized directly by imposing a pH gradient in tonoplast-enriched vesicles. The pH gradient was imposed by diluting K+-loaded vesicles into a K+-free medium. Nigericin induced a K+/H+ exchange resulting in a pH gradient of 2 (acid inside). The pH gradient was capable of driving 45Ca2+ accumulation. Ca2+ uptake was tightly coupled to H+ loss as increasing Ca2+ levels progressively dissipated the steady state pH gradient. Ca2+ uptake displayed saturation kinetics with a Km(app) for Ca2+ of 10 microM. The relative affinity of the antiporter for transport of divalent cations was Ca2+ greater than Sr2+ greater than Ba2+ greater than Mg2+. La3+ or Mn2+ blocked Ca2+ uptake possibly by occupying the Ca2+-binding site. Ruthenium red (I50 = 40 microM) and N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (I50 = 3 microM) specifically inhibited the H+/Ca2+ antiporter. When driven by pH jumps, the H+/Ca2+ exchange generated a membrane potential, interior positive, as shown by [14C]SCN accumulation. Furthermore, Ca2+ uptake was stimulated by an imposed negative membrane potential. The results support a simple model of one Ca2+ taken up per H+ lost. The exchange transport can be reversed, as a Ca2+ gradient (Ca2+in greater than Ca2+out) was effective in forming a pH gradient (acid inside). We suggest that the H+/Ca2+ exchange normally transports Ca2+ into the vacuole; however, under certain conditions, Ca2+ may be released into the cytoplasm via this antiporter."
https://openalex.org/W1558275686,"Thyrotropin (TSH) is an anterior pituitary glycoprotein hormone which modulates thyroid hormone production by the thyroid gland. TSH and its two subunits, TSH beta and alpha-subunit, are in turn regulated by the thyroid hormones and several stimulatory and inhibitory factors produced by the hypothalamus. Hypothalamic hormones such as thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) and dopamine have profound effects on TSH secretion and may also modulate TSH synthesis. We investigated the ability of these two hormones to directly influence the expression of the TSH subunit genes by measuring subunit mRNA synthesis rates in treated and untreated pituitary cell cultures from hypothyroid rats. In this system, basal rates of mRNA synthesis were similar for the two subunits, with 95 ppm for alpha-subunit and 85 ppm for TSH beta. Treatment with 10(-5) M dopamine, an inhibitor of TSH secretion, decreased both alpha-subunit and TSH beta mRNA synthesis within 15 min, and maximal decreases of approximately 75% for both subunits were obtained after 30 min. The inhibitory effects of dopamine were overcome by co-incubation of the cells with dopamine plus 5 X 10(-4) M dibutyryl cyclic AMP (cAMP), indicating that the actions of dopamine may have been mediated by decreasing intracellular cAMP levels. Treatment with 10(-7) M TRH, a potent stimulator of TSH secretion, increased transcription of both TSH subunit genes 3- to 5-fold. Maximal stimulation occurred after 30 min of treatment; however, 2-fold increases were maintained for up to 4 h and at 48 h. Cytoplasmic levels of TSH beta and alpha-subunit mRNA after 48 h were also depressed by dopamine (50-70%) and increased by TRH (200-280%) treatment. TRH-stimulated TSH beta and alpha-subunit mRNA synthesis was partially inhibited by dopamine. In a 4-h treatment period, TSH beta mRNA synthesis was decreased from 250 to 73% of control and alpha-subunit was decreased from 333 to 182% of control values. Thus, both dopamine and TRH can act to modulate TSH subunit gene transcription, although they differ in the direction of the response and the relative effects on TSH beta and alpha-subunit. The magnitude of the transcriptional response for either TRH (200 to 500%) or dopamine (75%) is similar to the observed changes in cytoplasmic levels of TSH subunit mRNAs and indicates that transcriptional control of the TSH genes may be an important component of hypothalamic regulation of TSH."

https://openalex.org/W1967481287,"Human interferon stimulates a transient two- to threefold increase in the concentration of diacylglycerol and inositol tris-phosphate within 15 to 30 seconds of cell exposure to interferon. Antibodies to interferon inhibit this effect. The stimulation was measurable in isolated cell membranes exposed to interferon. Human alpha and beta, but not gamma, interferon stimulate this increase in cells containing the appropriate interferon receptor. The effect was proportional to the number of interferon receptors. Both the diacylglycerol increase and antiviral effects induced by interferon could be correlated in terms of dose dependence. Thus, a transient diacylglycerol increase is an early event in the interferon-induced transmembrane signaling process."
https://openalex.org/W1593680922,"Binding of mitogenic lectins to T lymphocytes results in elevated cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentrations ([Ca2+]i). This change in [Ca2+]i is thought to be essential for cellular proliferation. In addition, the lectins increase the conductance to K+ through voltage-sensitive channels. Based on the inhibitory effect of K+ channel blockers on lectin-induced mitogenesis, it has been suggested that Ca2+ could enter the cells through these activated K+ channels (Chandy, K. G., De Coursey, T. E., Cahalan, M. D., McLaughlin, C., and Gupta, S. (1984) J. Exp. Med. 160, 369-385; Chandy, K. G., De Coursey, T. E., Cahalan, M. D., and Gupta, S. (1985) J. Clin. Immunol. 5, 1-5). This hypothesis was tested experimentally by measuring the effect of activation or blockade of K+ channels on [Ca2+]i using quin-2 and indo-1 and by determining the effect of K+ channel blockers on lectin-induced proliferation. We found that: depolarization of the membrane, which is expected to open the K+ channels, failed to increase [Ca2+]i, K+ channel blockers such as tetraethylammonium and 4-aminopyridine had only a marginal effect on the lectin-induced increase in [Ca2+]i, and the inhibitory effect of K+ channel blockers on proliferation was found to be nonspecific, occurring also when proliferation was triggered by phorbol esters under conditions where [Ca2+]i is not elevated. It is concluded that the lectin-induced changes in [Ca2+]i are not mediated by the opening of voltage-gated K+ channels."

Transcripts from the hGH gene were correctly initiated and could be positively regulated by glucocorticoids. In contrast to the endogenous rat GH gene and a transfected, modified rat GH gene, the hGH gene was negatively regulated by triiodothyronine. Analysis of hGH gene 5'-flanking deletions indicated that a distal regulatory element is required for efficient transcription. Thus promoter, glucocorticoid, and thyroid hormone control elements are present on the transfected hGH gene, whose expression may be negatively controlled by thyroid hormone."
https://openalex.org/W1979173548,"RNA entering the E. coli replication origin, oriC, in the counterclockwise direction terminates at several sites throughout the origin sequence. The significant finding was that nine clusters of these termination sites are found at the nine clusters of RNA to DNA transitions in oriC. The majority of these transcripts terminate with cytosine. Termination sites are associated with 9 of the 11 GATC sites and all DnaA protein-binding sites. Chloramphenicol-treated cells contain an increased amount of this RNA species, while cells starved for isoleucine have greatly reduced levels, indicating that synthesis of these transcripts is stringently regulated. Both decreased and increased intracellular levels of DnaA protein decrease the fraction of transcription that enters oriC."
https://openalex.org/W1560111844,"The yolk sac carcinoma cell line L2 secretes a chondroitin/dermatan sulfate proteoglycan that has an Mr 10,000 core protein and carries an average of 14 glycosaminoglycan chains. The amino acid sequence of the mature core protein has been determined from cloned cDNA (Bourdon, M. A., Oldberg, A., Pierschbacher, M., and Ruoslahti, E. (1985) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 82, 1321-1325). From additional cDNA sequences described in this report we have identified the prepro core protein precursor of the yolk sac carcinoma chondroitin/dermatan sulfate proteoglycan. From the amino acid sequence of the core protein precursor can be deduced the protein processing events in the biosynthesis of the proteoglycan. The amino acid sequence shows that the 104-amino acid mature core protein is processed from a 179-amino acid prepro core protein precursor which, in addition to the mature core protein, contains a 26-amino acid signal peptide as well as a 49-amino acid propeptide. The molecular weight of the prepro core protein predicted from the cDNA sequence (Mr = 18,600) was in good agreement with the molecular weight of the in vitro translation product (Mr = 19,000) of hybrid-selected mRNA. Accordingly, we have designated the proteoglycan core protein PG19. Further analysis of the PG19 mRNA by RNA sequencing confirmed the identification of the core protein translation initiation codon by revealing stop codons in all three reading frames of the upstream mRNA sequence. Primer extension analyses demonstrated that the 5' untranslated sequence of the proteoglycan mRNA is approximately 220 nucleotides in length, which, combined with the length of cDNA clones, accounts for the entire length of the coding sequence of PG19 mRNA from L2 cells. The cDNA sequences presented here establish the complete protein sequence of PG19 and provide evidence of polypeptide processing during the biosynthesis of the proteoglycan core protein."
https://openalex.org/W1973781691,"The group I intron in the Neurospora mitochondrial large rRNA gene is not self-splicing in vitro. Here, we show that this intron can be spliced from 35S pre-rRNA in RNPs or from deproteinized 35S pre-rRNA or in vitro transcripts by a soluble activity that is present in mitochondrial lysates and can be released from RNPs. Splicing occurs by the same guanosine-initiated transesterification mechanism characteristic of self-splicing group I introns, but is absolutely dependent upon proteins that are presumably required for correct folding of the pre-rRNA. The soluble splicing activity is not simply associated with large subunit ribosomal proteins. Nuclear mutant cyt18-1, which is defective in splicing a number of group I introns in vivo, is grossly deficient in the soluble splicing activity. Our results suggest that the cyt18 gene encodes or regulates a component of an activity that functions in splicing group I introns in Neurospora mitochondria."
https://openalex.org/W1505081922,"Poly(A)+ RNA from lactating rat mammary glands was size-fractionated to enrich the relative amount of acetyl-CoA carboxylase mRNA. The enriched mRNA was used to generate a lambda gt11 cDNA library. Initial screening with polyclonal antiserum to acetyl-CoA carboxylase produced three positive clones. Western blot analysis revealed that two clones, lambda DH3 and lambda KH18, synthesized 165,000-dalton proteins that were recognized by antibodies to acetyl-CoA carboxylase and beta-galactosidase, indicating that acetyl-CoA carboxylase/beta-galactosidase fusion proteins were produced. Competition experiments with purified acetyl-CoA carboxylase further demonstrated that the fusion proteins contained acetyl-CoA carboxylase protein segments. Antibodies which are specific to the fusion proteins were isolated. These antibodies cross-reacted only with acetyl-CoA carboxylase in a preparation of partially purified acetyl-CoA carboxylase. In addition, the antibodies immunoprecipitated enzyme activity from a crude liver homogenate. Northern blot analysis of total RNA revealed two RNA species: one 10 kilobases and the other 3.0 kilobases. The levels of these RNA species increased when starved animals were fed a fat-free diet, indicating that they are coordinately regulated."
https://openalex.org/W1991941454,The observation that voltage-dependent K+ channels are required for activation of human T lymphocytes suggests that pathological conditions involving abnormal mitogen responses might be reflected in ion channel abnormalities. Gigaohm seal techniques were used to study T cells from MRL/MpJ-lpr/lpr mice; these mice develop generalized lymphoproliferation of functionally and phenotypically abnormal T cells and a disease resembling human systemic lupus erythematosus. The number and predominant type of K+ channels in T cells from these mice differ dramatically from those in T cells from control strains and a congenic strain lacking the lpr gene locus. Thus an abnormal pattern of ion channel expression has now been associated with a genetic defect in cells of the immune system.
https://openalex.org/W1604128843,"A method is described for isolating the beta subunit from spinach chloroplast F1 (CF1). The isolated beta subunit reconstituted an active F1 hybrid with the F1 of Rhodospirillum rubrum chromatophores from which the beta subunit had been removed. The CF1 beta subunit was similar to the isolated beta subunit of Escherichia coli F1 (Gromet-Elhanan, Z., Khananshivili, D., Weiss, S., Kanazawa, H., and Futai, M. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 12635-12640) in that it restored a substantial rate of ATP hydrolysis and low, but significant light-dependent ATP synthesis to the beta-less chromatophores. The low rate of photophosphorylation observed with the hybrid enzyme probably resulted from a looser coupling of the CF1 beta subunit to proton translocation in the R. rubrum Fo-F1 complex. The hybrid enzyme exhibited a high specificity for Mg2+-ATP as substrate for ATP hydrolysis and both ATP synthesis and hydrolysis were strongly inhibited by the antibiotic tentoxin. In contrast, chromatophores reconstituted with the native R. rubrum beta subunit actively hydrolyzed both Mg2+-ATP and Ca2+-ATP and were insensitive to tentoxin. These results indicate a close functional homology between the beta subunits of the prokaryotic and eukaryotic H+-ATPases and suggest a role for the beta subunit in conferring the different metal ion specificities and inhibitor sensitivities upon the enzymes. They also demonstrate the feasibility of isolating the beta subunit from CF1 in a reconstitutively active form."
https://openalex.org/W1634060059,"The steady state levels of mitochondrial rRNAs, 5 tRNAs, the 9 S RNA, and the RNA products from the genes coding for subunits 6 and 9 of the ATP synthase, cytochrome b, and subunit 1 of cytochrome oxidase have been determined after growth of yeast under conditions of respiratory repression or derepression. The analysis indicates that the mitochondrial rRNAs are present in 2000 or 9000 copies/cell in repressed or derepressed yeast, respectively. The levels of the other RNAs also differed to a similar extent, with the exception of the level of the tRNAfMet which differs by only 1.7-fold. The levels of the individual protein coding RNAs varied from 480 copies/cell for the Oli-1 RNA to 100 copies/cell for the Oli-2 RNA under derepressive conditions and from 130 copies/cell to 33 copies/cell for the same RNAs in glucose repressive conditions. The levels of the tRNAs varied even more markedly, ranging from 4200 copies/cell for the tRNAPhe to 240 copies/cell for the tRNACys after growth in derepressive conditions and from 800 copies/cell for the tRNAfMet to 30 copies/cell for the tRNACys of glucose repressed yeast. These results indicate that glucose repression uniformly decreases the levels of the individual mitochondrial RNAs studied. This decrease is related to a lower synthesis of mitochondrial RNA in the glucose repressed cells as compared to derepressed cells."
https://openalex.org/W1996955164,"In multiple sclerosis, a demyelinating disease of young adults, there is a paucity of myelin repair in the central nervous system (CNS) which is necessary for the restoration of fast saltatory conduction in axons. Consequently, this relapsing disease often causes marked disability. In similar diseases of small rodents, however, remyelination can be quite extensive, as in the demyelinating disease caused by the A59 strain of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV-A59), a coronavirus of mice. To investigate when and where oligodendrocytes are first triggered to repair CNS myelin in such disease, we have used a complementary DNA probe specific for one major myelin protein gene, myelin basic protein (MBP), which hybridizes with the four forms of MBP messenger RNA in rodents. Using Northern blot and in situ hybridization techniques, we previously found that MBP mRNA is first detected at about 5 days after birth, peaks at 18 days and progressively decreases to 25% of the peak levels in the adult. We now report that in spinal cord sections of adult animals with active demyelination and inflammatory cells, in situ hybridization reveals a dramatic increase in probe binding to MBP-specific mRNA at 2-3 weeks after virus inoculation and before remyelination can be detected by morphological methods. This increase of MBP-specific mRNA is found at the edge of the demyelinating area and extends into surrounding areas of normal-appearing white matter. Thus, in situ hybridization with myelin-specific probes appears to be a useful method for detecting the timing, intensity and location of myelin protein gene reactivation preceding remyelination. This method could be used to elucidate whether such a reactivation occurs in multiple sclerosis brain tissue. Our results suggest that in mice, glial cells react to a demyelinating process with widespread MBP mRNA synthesis which may be triggered by a diffusible factor released in the demyelinated areas."
https://openalex.org/W1500888888,"To elucidate the mechanism of sigma release in the transcript by Escherichia coli DNA-dependent RNA polymerase, we obtained the time courses of sigma release and elongation of product RNA by a rapid kinetic technique; transcription was synchronously initiated from A1 promoter on T7 DNA by the addition of four substrates to a stoichiometric mixture of holoenzyme and template DNA, and then quenched by the addition of EDTA. The elongation rate was changed by limiting the concentration of one of four substrates, GTP. At reduced GTP concentration, elongation was decelerated, but the time course of sigma release was unchanged. No connection between sigma release and length of RNA product was found. The results lead to the conclusion that sigma is released depending only on time elapsed after initiation, not on the length of RNA product. We propose a two-step model for sigma release with a rapid triggering and a slow dissociation of about 5 s. This dissociation, the rate-determining step of sigma release, is independent of the rate of elongation."
https://openalex.org/W2025148393,"To determine whether E. coli rho protein mediates termination of transcription by interacting with specific segments of the nascent transcript, DNA oligonucleotides were used to sequester segments of phage lambda cro mRNA in hybrid helices. Formation of hybrids was demonstrated with RNAase H assays. Oligonucleotides complementary to either of two distinct, single-stranded sequences near the 3' end inhibited rho action at tR1, while oligonucleotides complementary to the sequence between those segments or to more 5' segments did not. The inhibitory oligonucleotides did not affect the elongation of cro mRNA or rho action on other transcripts. The results indicate that termination of transcription at tR1 is dependent upon contact of rho factor with specific, single-stranded domains near the 3' end of cro mRNA."
https://openalex.org/W1506009320,"In Trypanosoma equiperdum, some newly replicated kinetoplast DNA minicircles contain a single gap at a unique location in their newly synthesized strand (Ntambi, J. M., and Englund, P. T. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 5574-5579). We now report that ribonucleotides are associated with this gap, with one or two covalently attached to the 5' terminus of the newly synthesized strand. There appear to be two possible RNA/DNA junctions at adjacent positions in the sequence. The ribonucleotides may be remnants of a replication primer, and their presence strongly implies that the gap is at the site of a replication origin."
https://openalex.org/W1564001098,"Doxorubicin, an anticancer drug, induces Ca2+ release from the terminal cisternae (TC) of skeletal muscle (Zorzato, F., Salviati, G., Facchinetti, T., and Volpe, P. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 7349-7355). Long wave ultraviolet irradiation of a TC fraction with morphologically intact feet structures (Saito, A., Seiler, S., Chu, A., and Fleischer, S. (1984) J. Cell Biol. 99, 875-885) in the presence of [14C]doxorubicin, led to covalent photolabeling of two proteins that exhibited apparent Mr values of 350,000 and 170,000. Such proteins were found to be absent in a fraction of longitudinal sarcoplasmic reticulum but enriched in junctional face membranes obtained by Triton X-100 treatment of the TC fraction. Three additional proteins with Mr values of 80,000, 60,000, and 30,000 were also faintly labeled in the junctional face membrane fraction. On a molar basis the highest level of incorporation was found in the 170,000-Da protein, probably a Ca2+-binding protein (Campbell, K. P., MacLennan, D. H., and Jorgensen, A. O. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 11267-11273). A lower level of labeling was observed in the 350,000-Da protein, tentatively identified as a component of the feet structures (Cadwell, J. J. S., and Caswell, A. H. (1982) J. Cell Biol. 93, 543-550). Photolabeling of junctional TC proteins did not occur if a 10-50-fold excess cold doxorubicin was included in the assay medium, indicating that it was displaceable and specific, and if ultraviolet irradiation was omitted. Photolabeling was inhibited by caffeine or ruthenium red, i.e. by an activator and an inhibitor of Ca2+ release from TC, respectively. Furthermore, photolabeling was prevented by [ethylenebis(oxyethylenenitrilo)]tetraacetic acid suggesting that doxorubicin binding is Ca2+-dependent. Doxorubicin-binding proteins are constituents of the junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum and might be involved in modulating Ca2+ release from TC."
https://openalex.org/W1573512808,"Total poly(A)-containing mRNA was isolated from rat ventral prostate and translated in a reticulocyte lysate system. The proteins corresponding to S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase were precipitated with a specific antiserum to this protein. Two proteins were found; one having an Mr of 32,000, which corresponded to the subunit of this enzyme, and a larger protein of Mr 37,000. Immunopurification of polysomes with the antiserum to S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase followed by mRNA extraction yielded an mRNA preparation which was 10-30% pure mRNA for S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase. The translation of this mRNA showed clearly that the protein of Mr 37,000 was a precursor of the Mr 32,000 S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase subunit. Treatment with 2-difluoromethylornithine, which depletes cellular spermidine and is known to increase the content of S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase protein, led to a 9-fold increase in the content of its mRNA, but treatment with methylglyoxal bis(guanylhydrazone) did not change the mRNA content."
https://openalex.org/W2241523960,"Proton transport catalyzed by the sodium pump was demonstrated using proteoliposomes reconstituted with purified pig kidney Na+,K+-ATPase. Intravesicular pH was monitored with fluorescence from fluorescein isothiocyanate dextran introduced into the vesicles. An ATP-induced ouabain-sensitive acidification of the intravesicular medium was observed, when the vesicles were incubated with ATP and without Na+. The ATP-induced acidification was blocked by either extravesicular Na+ or pretreatment of the enzyme with ouabain before reconstitution. Protonophores, X-537A or carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone, abolished the intravesicular acidification. The acidification was not inhibited by 3 mM tetra-n-butylammonium. The initial rate of the H+ uptake was increased with a decrease in pH of the extravesicular medium, and the maximum rate was obtained at pH 5.5-5.6. It is concluded that H+ can be transported in place of Na+ by the sodium pump."
https://openalex.org/W1575306313,"The toxic organochlorine pesticide, chlordecone (Kepone), is excreted in human bile primarily as a stable, reduced monoalcohol metabolite. This bioreduction is catalyzed by a hepatic cytosolic enzyme activity termed chlordecone reductase. We purified this enzyme from human liver and found that chlordecone reductase resembles the family of xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes referred to as the aldo-keto reductases based on its biochemical characteristics, including its ability to catalyze the reduction of a carbonyl-containing substrate. However, analyses of liver cytosolic samples on immunoblots developed with anti-chlordecone reductase antibodies revealed that immunoreactive proteins were present only in those mammalian species that convert chlordecone to chlordecone alcohol in vivo (man, gerbil, and rabbit) and not in those species unable to reduce chlordecone (rat, mouse, and hamster). Hence, chlordecone reductase is unique among aldo-keto reductases in being species-specific. Quantitative immunoblot analyses of seven human liver specimens disclosed two immunoreactive proteins whose total concentration varied over a 6-fold range. Moreover, the amount of immunoreactive protein was directly proportional to chlordecone reductase activity in each sample. We conclude that chlordecone reductase is a unique aldo-keto reductase of potential clinical importance whose expression varies markedly among individuals."
https://openalex.org/W2000252729,"In the membrane of the flight muscle cells of developing Drosophila a large calcium-sensitive potassium current, IKc, was found. It was present before the development of voltage-activated potassium channels and seems to be the first potassium current to develop in the membrane. Also present in these early cells were large numbers of occult (hidden) calcium channels, which remained inactive until the end of pupal development. These inactive calcium channels could be made to function by injecting adenosine triphosphate or ethyleneglycol tetraacetic acid into the early cells. IKc has kinetic properties resembling the later developing voltage-sensitive current IKv, and is distinct from the fast, transient calcium-dependent outward current IAc, which appears much later in development. IAc closely resembles the voltage-sensitive current IAv, also present in these cells. Thus, both of the voltage-sensitive potassium channel types, IAv and IKv, have similar calcium-sensitive counterparts, IAc and IKc, that are present in the same cells."
https://openalex.org/W2460762159,"The effects of the voltage-sensitive sodium channel activator batrachotoxin (BTX) on the binding properties of muscarinic receptors were studied in homogenates of rat atria. Also studied were the effects of muscarinic ligands on the binding of tritium-labeled batrachotoxin ([3H]BTX) to the same preparation. BTX (1 microM), which induces an open state in sodium channels, enhanced the affinity of binding of several agonists to the muscarinic receptors. Analysis of the data indicated that the effect of BTX was to increase the affinity of the agonists toward the high-affinity sites. Binding of antagonists was not affected by BTX. At higher concentrations of toxin, the density of the high affinity muscarinic sites was also affected. The binding of agonists (but not of antagonists) to muscarinic receptors in turn enhanced the specific binding of [3H]BTX to sodium channels. These effects on the muscarinic receptors and on the sodium channels were inhibited in the presence of Gpp(NH)p at concentrations lower than those bringing about conversion of binding sites from the high affinity to the low affinity conformation. On the basis of these findings we suggest that the opening of sodium channels and the binding of agonists to muscarinic receptors in rat atrial membranes are coupled events which are mediated by guanine nucleotide-binding protein(s). Such a hypothesis is consistent with previously proposed models for signal transduction in the membrane."

https://openalex.org/W2125911326,"Ia antigens are polymorphic cell-surface molecules that control the immune response. We have begun to localize important functional sites on one of the Ia molecules, A alpha. Herein, we focus on the A alpha k and A alpha b alleles and ask what defines ""b-ness"" and ""k-ness"" for a panel of monoclonal antibodies. Two independent experimental strategies are employed: the ability of 12 monoclonal antibodies to recognize L cell transfectants bearing chimeric and mutant A alpha chains is assessed, and the amino acid sequences of A alpha chains expressed by immunoselected B lymphoma mutants are deduced. For each antibody, we identify a stretch of polymorphic residues critical for recognition; for several, we can pinpoint a single amino acid. Certain stretches of A alpha (depending on the allele) appear strikingly immunodominant."
