https://openalex.org/W2164674870,"N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) represent a subclass of glutamate receptors that play a critical role in neuronal development and physiology. We report here the generation of mice expressing only 5% of normal levels of the essential NMDAR1 (NR1) subunit. Unlike NR1 null mice, these mice survive to adulthood and display behavioral abnormalities, including increased motor activity and stereotypy and deficits in social and sexual interactions. These behavioral alterations are similar to those observed in pharmacologically induced animal models of schizophrenia and can be ameliorated by treatment with haloperidol or clozapine, antipsychotic drugs that antagonize dopaminergic and serotonergic receptors. These findings support a model in which reduced NMDA receptor activity results in schizophrenic-like behavior and reveals how pharmacological manipulation of monoaminergic pathways can affect this phenotype."

https://openalex.org/W2012496594,"Recent studies have reinforced the view that the lateral hypothalamic area (LHA) regulates food intake and body weight. We identified leptin-sensitive neurons in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus (Arc) that innervate the LHA using retrograde tracing with leptin administration. We found that retrogradely labeled cells in the Arc contained neuropeptide Y (NPY) mRNA or proopiomelanocortin (POMC) mRNA. Following leptin administration, NPY cells in the Arc did not express Fos but expressed suppressor of cytokine signaling-3 (SOCS-3) mRNA. In contrast, leptin induced both Fos and SOCS-3 expression in POMC neurons, many of which also innervated the LHA. These findings suggest that leptin directly and differentially engages NPY and POMC neurons that project to the LHA, linking circulating leptin and neurons that regulate feeding behavior and body weight homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W2000101032,"The homeobox gene Hb9, like its close relative MNR2, is expressed selectively by motor neurons (MNs) in the developing vertebrate CNS. In embryonic chick spinal cord, the ectopic expression of MNR2 or Hb9 is sufficient to trigger MN differentiation and to repress the differentiation of an adjacent population of V2 interneurons. Here, we provide genetic evidence that Hb9 has an essential role in MN differentiation. In mice lacking Hb9 function, MNs are generated on schedule and in normal numbers but transiently acquire molecular features of V2 interneurons. The aberrant specification of MN identity is associated with defects in the migration of MNs, the emergence of the subtype identities of MNs, and the projection of motor axons. These findings show that HB9 has an essential function in consolidating the identity of postmitotic MNs."
https://openalex.org/W2084668768,"Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used to determine whether different kinds of visual attention rely on a common neural substrate. Within one session, subjects performed three different attention experiments (each comparing an attentionally demanding task with an easier task using identical stimuli): (1) peripheral shifting, (2) object matching, and (3) a nonspatial conjunction task. Two areas were activated in all three experiments: one at the junction of intraparietal and transverse occipital sulci (IPTO), and another in the anterior intraparietal sulcus (AIPS). These regions are not simply involved in any effortful task, because they were not activated in a fourth experiment comparing a difficult language task with an easier control task. Thus, activity in IPTO and AIPS generalizes across a wide variety of attention-requiring tasks, supporting the existence of a common neural substrate underlying multiple modes of visual selection."
https://openalex.org/W2093655143,"Drosophila Reaper (RPR), Head Involution Defective (HID), and GRIM induce caspase-dependent cell death and physically interact with the cell death inhibitor DIAP1. Here we show that HID blocks DIAP1's ability to inhibit caspase activity and provide evidence suggesting that RPR and GRIM can act similarly. Based on these results, we propose that RPR, HID, and GRIM promote apoptosis by disrupting productive IAP-caspase interactions and that DIAP1 is required to block apoptosis-inducing caspase activity. Supporting this hypothesis, we show that elimination of DIAP1 function results in global early embryonic cell death and a large increase in DIAP1-inhibitable caspase activity and that DIAP1 is still required for cell survival when expression of rpr, hid, and grim is eliminated."

https://openalex.org/W1983682905,"It is hypothesized that Ca2+ stimulation of calmodulin (CaM)-activated adenylyl cyclases (AC1 or AC8) generates cAMP signals critical for late phase LTP (L-LTP) and long-term memory (LTM). However, mice lacking either AC1 or AC8 exhibit normal L-LTP and LTM. Here, we report that mice lacking both enzymes (DKO) do not exhibit L-LTP or LTM. To determine if these defects are due to a loss of cAMP increases in the hippocampus, DKO mice were unilaterally cannulated to deliver forskolin. Administration of forskolin to area CA1 before training restored normal LTM. We conclude that Ca2+-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity is essential for L-LTP and LTM and that AC1 or AC8 can produce the necessary cAMP signal."
https://openalex.org/W2098318544,"Characterization of mammalian homologues ofDrosophila transient receptor potential protein (TRP) is an important clue to understand molecular mechanisms underlying Ca2+ influx activated in response to stimulation of Gq protein-coupled receptors in vertebrate cells. Here we have isolated cDNA encoding a novel seventh mammalian TRP homologue, TRP7, from mouse brain. TRP7 showed abundant RNA expression in the heart, lung, and eye and moderate expression in the brain, spleen, and testis. TRP7 recombinantly expressed in human embryonic kidney cells exhibited distinctive functional features, compared with other TRP homologues. Basal influx activity accompanied by reduction in Ca2+ release from internal stores was characteristic of TRP7-expressing cells but was by far less significant in cells expressing TRP3, which is structurally the closest to TRP7 in the TRP family. TRP7 induced Ca2+ influx in response to ATP receptor stimulation at ATP concentrations lower than those necessary for activation of TRP3 and for Ca2+ release from the intracellular store, which suggests that the TRP7 channel is activated independently of Ca2+ release. In fact, TRP7 expression did not affect capacitative Ca2+ entry induced by thapsigargin, whereas TRP7 greatly potentiated Mn2+ influx induced by diacylglycerols without involvement of protein kinase C. Nystatin-perforated and conventional whole-cell patch clamp recordings from TRP7-expressing cells demonstrated the constitutively activated and ATP-enhanced inward cation currents, both of which were initially blocked and then subsequently facilitated by extracellular Ca2+ at a physiological concentration. Impairment of TRP7 currents by internal perfusion of the Ca2+ chelator 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid revealed an essential role of intracellular Ca2+ in activation of TRP7, and their potent activation by the diacylglycerol analogue suggests that the TRP7 channel is a new member of diacylglycerol-activated cation channels. Relative permeabilities indicate that TRP7 is slightly selective to divalent cations. Thus, our findings reveal an interesting correspondence of TRP7 to the background and receptor stimulation-induced cation currents in various native systems.

It has been recognized that subsequent hydrolysis of phosphoinositides is linked to Ca2+ influx across the plasma membrane (1Fasolato C. Innocenti B. Pozzan T. Trends Pharmacol.

Diverse ion channels activated by various triggers have been reported to be responsible for this type of Ca2+ influx (1Fasolato C. Innocenti B. Pozzan T. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1994; 15: 77-83Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). Among members of the group, recent attention was particularly directed to capacitative Ca2+ entry (CCE1; in other words, Ca2+ release-activated current or store-operated channel) that is activated through Ca2+ release from the intracellular Ca2+ store, endoplasmic reticulum, induced by inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3), and consequent depletion of Ca2+ from the store (2Clapham D.E.

In addition, other plasma membrane ion channels directly activated by second messengers such as Ca2+, IP3, inositol 1,3,4,5-tetraphosphate, and arachidonic acid metabolites are also categorized as Ca2+-permeable channels activated in response to receptor stimulation (1Fasolato C.

Especially, as forDrosophila TRP and TRP-like (TRPL), polyunsaturated fatty acids, such as arachidonic acid and linolenic acid, were shown to activate them in both native and recombinant systems (35Chyb S. Raghu P. Hardie R.C. Nature. 1999; 397: 255-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). This store-independent activation of TRP and TRPL is consistent with the observation that IP3 receptor is not essential for receptor potentials generated by TRP and TRPL in Drosophilaphotoreceptors (37Acharya J.K. Jalink K. Hardy R.W. Hartenstein V. Zuker C.S. Neuron. 1997; 13: 881-887Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (200) Google Scholar). As for vertebrates, six members of mammalian TRP homologues (TRP1–6) were so far identified, and three TRP homologues TRP3, TRP5, and TRP6 have been reported to exhibit store-independent activities in recombinant expression systems (24Boulay G.

Nature. 1999; 397: 259-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (1255) Google Scholar). Most recently, TRP3 and TRP6 have been reported to be activated by diacylglycerols, whereas TRP5 was unresponsive to them (36Hofmann T. Obukhov A.G. Schaefer M. Harteneck C. Gudermann T. Schultz G. Nature. 1999; 397: 259-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (1255) Google Scholar). In Drosophila photoreceptors, two homologues,Drosophila TRP and TRPL, are responsible for the light-sensitive conductances (15Hardie R.C. Minke B. Neuron. 1992; 8: 643-651Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar, 17Niemeyer B.A. Suzuki E. Scott K. Jalink K. Zuker C.S.

By contrast, in native mammalian cells, cationic currents induced by receptor stimulation have yet to be resolved into components mediated by individual TRP homologues and other unidentified entities. Here we found a novel member of the mammalian TRP family, TRP7, from mouse brain. TRP7 was widely distributed, being the most abundant in the heart, lung, and eye. Functional properties of TRP7 recombinantly expressed in human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells were distinct from those of TRP3, which is structurally the most homologous to TRP7 in the TRP family. TRP7 was constitutively activated to the level much higher than that of TRP3. Ca2+ influx mediated by TRP7 was enhanced by ATP receptor stimulation at the concentrations of ATP lower than those necessary for Ca2+ release from the store and Ca2+ influx via TRP3. The experiments also showed an essential involvement of diacylglycerol and intracellular Ca2+ in activation of TRP7. In addition, the content of the intracellular Ca2+store was reduced by TRP7 expression but not by TRP3 expression. Nystatin-perforated patch clamp recordings from TRP7-expressing cells demonstrated the constitutive and ATP-enhanced nonselective cation currents, which were suppressed by a physiological concentration of extracellular Ca2+. Our findings demonstrate that TRP7 encodes a cation channel with distinctive functional properties among mammalian TRP homologues, suggesting that TRP7 is responsible for spontaneous and receptor stimulation-induced non-selective cationic currents known for important physiological roles in native tissues. To search for a novel mouse TRP homologue, a cDNA library was screened with the cDNA encoding mouse TRP2 as a probe, which was obtained by reverse transcriptase-PCR amplification from the mouse (BALB/c or 129/SvJ) brain poly(A)+ RNA using a pair of specific oligonucleotide primers T2-1 (5′-GACGACATGATCCGGTTCATGTTC-3′) and T2-2 (5′-CTCGATCTTCTGGAAGGAGTTGGTG-3′) (22Zhu X. Jiang M. Peyton M. Boulay G. Hurst R. Stefani E. Birnbaumer L. Cell. 1996; 85: 661-671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar), SuperScript II RNase H− reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.), and LA-Taq DNA polymerase (Takara, Otsu, Japan). Screening of the oligo(dT)-primed, size-selected (>1 kb) adult mouse (129/SvJ or BALB/c) brain cDNA library constructed in the Uni-ZAP XR vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) using the TRP2 cDNA probe yielded clone λa11. Sequence comparison with the known mammalian TRP homologues (TRP1–6) revealed that λa11 carries the cDNA (−94 to 2071) of a novel TRP homologue designated as TRP7. To obtain the entire coding sequence of the mouse TRP7 cDNA, rapid amplification of 3′-cDNA ends (3′-RACE) was performed using the specific primer T7-7 (5′-CGTGCTGTATGGGGTTTATAATGTCACC-3′), the template cDNAs constructed from C57BL/6J (B6) mouse brain poly(A)+ RNA, and the Marathon cDNA Amplification kit (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). The resulting ∼1.2-kb cDNA fragment was subcloned into pBluescript SK(+) (Stratagene) to a yield clone p3RACE7 (1950–3085 followed by a poly(dA) tract). Through comparison with other TRP homologues, it was suggested that the region of cDNA (residues 781–1128) was absent in λa11 due to alternative splicing. The region was amplified by reverse transcriptase-PCR from adult mouse brain total RNA using alfalfa mosaic virus reverse transcriptase (Takara), LA-Taq DNA polymerase (Takara), and the specific primers (5′-GACTACTTCTGCAAGTGCAATGAGTGC-3′ and 5′-TTCCACAAGTGTAGCACGTACTCCC-3′). The resulting 0.25–0.7-kb cDNA fragments were subcloned into pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega, Madison, WI) to yield p7α, p7β, p7γ, and p7δ carrying the ∼0.70, ∼0.52, ∼0.33, and ∼0.25-kb spliced variants, respectively, of TRP7 cDNA. The insert of p7γ corresponds to the spliced form of the cDNA carried by λa11. RNA blot hybridization analysis was carried out using total RNA (20 μg) from various tissues of 2-month-old B6 mice. The probe used to detect TRP7 RNA was the ∼0.44-kb SacI/PvuII fragment from p3RACE7. Random Primer DNA Labeling Kit version 2 (Takara) was used to32P label the probe. Hybridization was performed at 42 °C in 50% formamide, 5× 5 SSC, 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), 0.1% SDS, 0.1% polyvinylpyrrolidone, 0.1% Ficoll 400 (Amerham Pharmacia Biotech), 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and 0.2 mg/ml sonicated herring sperm DNA, as described previously (25Okada T.

Brains were dissected from anesthetized 8-week-old B6 mice after perfusion with 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer and were postfixed overnight at 4 °C in the same fixative and subsequently dehydrated, embedded in paraffin, sliced at 8 μm, and mounted onto silicon-coated glass slides. The recombinant pBluescript SK(+) plasmid, pTRP7-25, containing the TRP7 cDNA fragment amplified from λa11 using the primers Ma19 (5′-CGTTAAGACTCTGCCCAA-3′) and Ma16 (5′-ACATCCTGCACGTACTGG-3′), was linearized by digesting the EcoRI or HindIII site (on vector) and transcribed using T3 or T7 MAXIscript RNA polymerase (Ambion, Austin, TX) with DIG RNA Labeling Mix (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for synthesis of the sense or antisense digoxigenin (DIG)-labeled RNA probes. Sections were partially digested by 0.8% pepsin in 0.2 nHCl and acetylated with 0.25% acetic anhydride in 0.1 mtriethanolamine (pH 8.0) after de-paraffinization and rehydration. Hybridization was performed for 12–16 h at 50 °C with 400 ng/ml antisense or sense probes in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 600 mm NaCl, 0.25% SDS, 1 mm EDTA (pH 8.0), 0.02% polyvinylpyrrolidone, 0.02% Ficoll 400, 0.02% bovine serum albumin, 0.2 mg/ml yeast tRNA, 10% dextran sulfate, and 50% formamide. The sections were washed in 2× SSC with 50% formamide at 50 °C for 30 min, treated with 10 μg/ml RNase A in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 1 mm EDTA (pH 8.0), and 500 mm NaCl to remove free probes, and washed at increasingly higher stringencies up to final condition of 0.2× SSC at 50 °C for 20 min. Washed slides were incubated in 1.5% blocking reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), and 150 mm NaCl (DIG buffer) at room temperature for 1 h. Immunochemical detection of the hybridized probes was performed using alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-DIG antibody (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) at 500 times dilution in DIG buffer for 60 min. The alkaline phosphatase activity was visualized by 12–16 h incubation with nitro blue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate alkaline phosphatase detection system (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 9.5), 50 mmMgCl2, and 100 mm NaCl under light protection. Expression plasmids for TRP7 were constructed as follows. A PCR product amplified from the clone λa11 using a sense primer (5′-GGGTCGACGGGTTTTTATTTTTAATTTTCTTTCAAATACTTCCACCATGTTGGGGAGCAACACC-3′), designed to contain the untranslated leader sequence from the alfalfa mosaic virus (39Jobling S.A. Gehrke L. Nature. 1987; 325: 622-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), a consensus sequence for translation initiation (40Kozak M. Cell. 1986; 44: 283-292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3590) Google Scholar), and nucleotide residues 1–18 of TRP7, and an antisense primer (5′-AGTGACCTCCAAGTGCTC-3′) was digested with SalI andApaLI. Another PCR product amplified from p3RACE7 using T7-7 (see above) and an antisense primer (5′-ATGCGGCCGCTTTGGAATGCTGTTAGAC-3′) was digested with NcoI and NotI. The resulting fragments were ligated with respective ApaLI-(701)/NcoI-(1999) fragments from p7α, p7β, and p7γ, and the 5.5-kb SalI/NotI fragment from pCI-neo (Promega, Madison, WI) to yield pCI-neo-mTRP7α, pCI-neo-mTRP7β, and pCI-neo-mTRP7γ, respectively. The TRP3 expression plasmid was constructed as follows. A PCR product amplified from the clone gλ-8 (41Mori Y. Takada N. Okada T. Wakamori M. Imoto K. Wanifuchi H. Oka H. Oba A. Ikenaka K.

Ikenaka K. Kurosaki T. Neuroreport. 1998; 9: 507-515PubMed Google Scholar), and an antisense primer (5′-GATGGCTAGCAGCAGCGCATCACC-3′) was digested with NotI. Another PCR product amplified from the clone λm20 (41Mori Y. Takada N. Okada T. Wakamori M. Imoto K. Wanifuchi H. Oka H. Oba A. Ikenaka K. Kurosaki T. Neuroreport. 1998; 9: 507-515PubMed Google Scholar) using a sense primer (5′-CGTTCCAAACTTTGGCTCTCCTACTTCGATG-3′) and an antisense primer (5′-CAGCGGCCGCTTGACTGCAGGTGGCTGCCTCAC-3′) was digested withPflMI and NotI. The resulting fragments were ligated with the NheI-(286)/PflMI-(2040) fragment and pCI-neo linearized with NotI to yield pCI-neo-mTRP3. HEK293 cells (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) were co-transfected with πH3-CD8 containing the cDNA of the T-cell antigen CD8 (42Jurman M.E. Boland L.M. Liu Y. Yellen G. BioTechniques. 1994; 17: 876-881PubMed Google Scholar) and one of pCI-neo-mTRP7α, pCI-neo-mTRP7β, pCI-neo-mTRP7γ, pCI-neo-mTRP3, and the vector pCI-neo. Transfection was carried out using SuperFect Transfection Reagent (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Cells were trypsinized, diluted with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 30 units/ml penicillin, and 30 μg/ml streptomycin, and plated onto glass coverslips 18 h after transfection. Then cells were subjected to measurements 18–42 h after plating on the coverslips. TRP homologue-expressing cells were selected through detection of CD8 co-expression using polystyrene microspheres precoated with antibody to CD8 (Dynabeads M-450 CD8; Dynal, Oslo, Norway). Cells on coverslips were loaded with fura-2 by incubation in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5 μm fura-2/AM (Dojindo Laboratories, Kumamoto, Japan) and 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C for 30 min and washed with the HEPES-buffered saline (HBS) containing (in mm) 107 NaCl, 6 KCl, 1.2 MgSO4, 2 CaCl2, 1.2 KH2PO4, 11.5 glucose, 20 HEPES, adjusted to pH 7.4 with NaOH. The coverslips were then placed in a perfusion chamber mounted on the stage of the microscope. Fluorescence images of the cells were recorded and analyzed with a video image analysis system (ARGUS-20/CA, Hamamatsu Photonics, Hamamatsu, Japan). The fura-2 fluorescence at an emission wavelength of 510 nm (bandwidth, 20 nm) was observed at room temperature by exciting fura-2 alternately at 340 and 380 nm (bandwidth, 11 nm). The 340:380 nm ratio images were obtained on a pixel by pixel basis and were converted to Ca2+ concentrations by in vitro calibration. The calibration procedure was performed according to Ueda and Okada (43Ueda S. Okada Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 1012: 254-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). All the reagents, except LaCl3 and GdCl3, dissolved in water, ethanol, or dimethyl sulfoxide were diluted to their final concentrations in HBS or Ca2+-free HBS containing (in mm) 107 NaCl, 6 KCl, 1.2 MgSO4, 1.2 KH2PO4, 0.5 EGTA, 11.5 glucose, 20 HEPES, adjusted to pH 7.4 with NaOH, and applied to the cells by perfusion. LaCl3 and GdCl3 (100 mm in water) were diluted in HBS or Ca2+-free HBS from which KH2PO4 was omitted. Data were accumulated under each condition from 2 to 4 experiments using cells prepared through 2–3 transfections. Mn2+entry was measured through monitoring the decline of fluorescence of fura-2 induced by binding of Mn2+. Fluorescence quenching was studied using the fura-2 isosbestic excitation wavelength at 360 nm and recording emitted fluorescence at 510 nm. The system used was the same as in the [Ca2+]i measurement. The fluorescence intensity relative to the initial values were obtained on a pixel by pixel basis. MnCl2 and ATP dissolved in water were diluted to their final concentrations in nominally Ca2+-free HBS from which KH2PO4 was omitted. For electrophysiological measurements, coverslips with cells were placed in a perfusion chamber. Cells prepared in this manner had membrane capacitance of 8–26 picofarads (n = 13). Patch electrodes having a resistance of 4–6 megohms (when filled with the pipette solution described below) were fabricated from 1.5-mm Pyrex capillaries, using an automatic multiple-stage micropipette puller (P-97, Sutter Instruments, USA), and heat-polished in a microforge bearing a thin indium-platinum heating wire (Narishige, Tokyo, Japan). Voltage generation and current signal acquisition were implemented through a high-impedance low-noise patch clamp amplifier (EPC-7, List Electronics, Darmstadt, Germany). Ramp currents were sampled at 2 kHz after low pass filtering at 1 kHz and analyzed with pCLAMP 6.02 software (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA) for Fig. 8 C. For long term recordings such as illustrated in Fig. 8 A, current signals were stored on a computer hard disc (filtered at 50 Hz), using an A/D, D/A converter, MacLab/4 (AD Instruments, New South Wales, Australia). The details for the nystatin-perforated recording have been described previously (44Chen S. Inoue R. Ito Y. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1993; 109: 793-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The pipette solution contained (in mm) 140 CsCl, 2 MgCl2, 10 HEPES, 20 glucose, adjusted to pH 7.2 with Tris base. For the conventional whole-cell recording, the pipette solution contained (in mm) 140 CsCl, 2 MgCl2, 10 BAPTA, and 0, 3, or 5 CaCl2, 2 ATP (free acid), 0.1 GTP (lithium salt), 10 HEPES, adjusted to pH 7.2 with Tris base. The Ca2+-free external solution contained (in mm) 140 NaCl, 0.5 EGTA, 10 HEPES, 20 glucose, adjusted to pH 7.4 with Tris base. For the nominally Ca2+-free external solution, EGTA was simply omitted from this solution. For 2 mmCa2+-containing external solution, 2 mmCaCl2 was added to the nominally Ca2+-free solution. For the cesium external solution, Na+ in the Ca2+-free solution was simply replaced by 140 mm Cs+. The 10 mm divalent cation-containing external solution contained (in mm) either of 10 CaCl2, BaCl2, or MnCl2, 126 N-methyl"
https://openalex.org/W2083071923,"Opiate analgesia, tolerance, and addiction are mediated by drug-induced activation of the mu opioid receptor. A fundamental question in addiction biology is why exogenous opiate drugs have a high liability for inducing tolerance and addiction while native ligands do not. Studies indicate that highly addictive opiate drugs such as morphine are deficient in their ability to induce the desensitization and endocytosis of receptors. Here, we demonstrate that this regulatory mechanism reveals an independent functional property of opiate drugs that can be distinguished from previously established agonist properties. Moreover, this property correlates with agonist propensity to promote physiological tolerance, suggesting a fundamental revision of our understanding of the role of receptor endocytosis in the biology of opiate drug action and addiction."

https://openalex.org/W2021202201,"To investigate mechanisms in the pathogenesis of cardiomyopathy associated with mutations of the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex, we analyzed genetically engineered mice deficient for either alpha-sarcoglycan (Sgca) or delta-sarcoglycan (Sgcd). We found that only Sgcd null mice developed cardiomyopathy with focal areas of necrosis as the histological hallmark in cardiac and skeletal muscle. Absence of the sarcoglycan-sarcospan (SG-SSPN) complex in skeletal and cardiac membranes was observed in both animal models. Loss of vascular smooth muscle SG-SSPN complex was only detected in Sgcd null mice and associated with irregularities of the coronary vasculature. Administration of a vascular smooth muscle relaxant prevented onset of myocardial necrosis. Our data indicate that disruption of the SG-SSPN complex in vascular smooth muscle perturbs vascular function, which initiates cardiomyopathy and exacerbates muscular dystrophy."
https://openalex.org/W1993982470,"Sonic hedgehog (Shh) specifies the identity of both motor neurons (MNs) and interneurons with morphogen-like activity. Here, we present evidence that the homeodomain factor HB9 is critical for distinguishing MN and interneuron identity in the mouse. Presumptive MN progenitors and postmitotic MNs express HB9, whereas interneurons never express this factor. This pattern resembles a composite of the avian homologs MNR2 and HB9. In mice lacking Hb9, the genetic profile of MNs is significantly altered, particularly by upregulation of Chx10, a gene normally restricted to a class of ventral interneurons. This aberrant gene expression is accompanied by topological disorganization of motor columns, loss of the phrenic and abducens nerves, and intercostal nerve pathfinding defects. Thus, MNs actively suppress interneuron genetic programs to establish their identity."

https://openalex.org/W2006134634,"Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) is one of several bioactive phospholipids that exert profound mitogenic and morphogenic actions. Originally characterized as a second messenger, S1P is now recognized to achieve many of its effects through cell surface, G protein-coupled receptors. We used a subunit-selective [35S]GTPγS binding assay to investigate whether the variety of actions exerted through Edg-1, a recently identified receptor for S1P, might be achieved through multiple G proteins. We found, employing both Sf9 and HEK293 cells, that Edg-1 activates only members of the Gi family, and not Gs, Gq, G12, or G13. We additionally established that Edg-1 activates Gi in response not only to S1P but also sphingosylphosphorylcholine; no effects of lysophosphatidic acid through Edg-1 were evident. Our assays further revealed a receptor(s) for S1P endogenous to HEK293 cells that mediates activation of G13 as well as Gi. Because several of the biological actions of S1P are assumed to proceed through the G12/13 family, we tested whether Edg-3 and H218/Edg-5, two other receptors for S1P, might have a broader coupling profile than Edg-1. Indeed, Edg-3 and H218/Edg-5 communicate not only with Gi but also with Gq and G13.

In addition to the functional coupling of Edg-1 with Gi proteins, physical interaction of Edg-1 with members of this family has been demonstrated. In transfected HEK293 cells, all four PTX-sensitive Gα subunits, αi1, αi2, αi3, and αo, associate with the third intracellular loop of Edg-1 in a GTPγS-sensitive manner, and αi1 and αi3co-immunoprecipitate with Edg-1 itself (32Lee M.-J. Evans M. Hla T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11272-11279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The signaling events mediated by Edg-1 are not uniformly sensitive to PTX, however. Neither the morphological changes nor the expression of P-cadherin induced by S1P in HEK293 cells expressing Edg-1 was inhibited by PTX (28Lee M.J. Van Brocklyn J.R. Thangada S. Liu C.H. Hand A.R. Menzeleev R. Spiegel S. Hla T. Science. 1998; 279: 1552-1555Crossref PubMed Scopus (875) Google Scholar). Instead, both of these responses were attenuated by the C3 exotoxin, which ADP-ribosylates the monomeric G protein Rho. The dependence of morphological changes and P-cadherin expression on Rho is consistent with a role for G12 or G13 as an intermediate in transduction. Constitutively active forms of α12 and α13 activate serum response factor (33Fromm C. Coso O.A. Montaner S. Xu N. Gutkind J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1995; 270: 24631-24634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar), both in a Rho-dependent manner. Moreover, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Rho, p115 RhoGEF, has been identified as a target for α13 (36Hart M.J. Jiang X. Kozasa T. Roscoe W. Singer W.D. Gilman A.G. Sternweis P.C. Bollag G.

Science. 1998; 280: 2109-2111Crossref PubMed Scopus (733) Google Scholar). The involvement of Rho, however, does not necessarily imply use of G12/13. Recent data implicate Gq, too, as a G protein that can either activate Rho or whose actions in part require already active Rho (34Mao J. Yuan H. Xie W. Wu D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12973-12976Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 38Katoh H. Aoki J. Yamaguchi Y. Kitano Y. Ichikawa A. Negishi M. J. Biol.

The lack of closely linked or unique effector read-outs for G12, G13, and Gq makes conclusive demonstration of potential Edg-1-G12/13/q interactions difficult. Thus, the coupling of Edg-1 to G proteins, although partially mapped, is not fully understood. Several other G protein-coupled receptors related to Edg-1 have also been characterized. Edg-2, or Vzg-1, the first member of the Edg family for which a ligand was identified, serves as a receptor for lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) (39Hecht J.H. Weiner J.A. Post S.R. Chun J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1071-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar, 40An S. Dickens M.A. Bleu T. Hallmark O.G. Goetzl E.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Chem. 1998; 273: 7906-7910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). On the basis of sequence homology with Edg-2, three other previously identified genes were added to this family. One receptor, Edg-4, was determined to be a receptor for LPA (42An S. Bleu T. Hallmark O.G. Goetzl E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7906-7910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar), whereas two other receptors, Edg-3 (43Yamaguchi F. Tokuda M. Hatase O. Brenner S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 227: 608-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) and Edg-5 (also named H218) (44MacLennan A.J. Browe C.S. Gaskin A.A. Lado D.C. Shaw G. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1994; 5: 201-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), were identified as receptors for S1P (45An S. Bleu T. Huang W. Hallmark O.G. Coughlin S.R. Goetzl E.J. FEBS Lett. 1997; 417: 279-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Edg-3 and Edg-5 are 44% similar to each other and approximately 50% similar in turn to Edg-1. S1P, acting through Edg-3 and Edg-5 but not Edg-1, elicits serum response element (SRE)-driven gene transcription in Jurkat cells and calcium mobilization in Xenopus oocytes, human TAg-Jurkat, and rat HTC4 hepatoma cells (45An S. Bleu T. Huang W. Hallmark O.G. Coughlin S.R. Goetzl E.J. FEBS Lett. 1997; 417: 279-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 46An S. Bleu T. Zheng Y. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 787-794PubMed Google Scholar). As the calcium and SRE responses elicited through these receptors are largely PTX-insensitive, and because Edg-1 does not activate SRE-driven gene transcription in these cells, Edg-3 and Edg-5 appear to use a set of signaling mechanisms, and thus possibly G proteins, partly distinct from that used by Edg-1. The assumption of involvement of specific G proteins on the basis of changes in second messengers or other downstream read-outs, however, is often specious. Convergence of signaling pathways initiated by different G proteins, e.g. the stimulation of phospholipase C by αq and βγ dimers released by other α subunits, or initiated by G protein and non-G protein inputs, e.g. the activation of mitogen-activated kinases by G protein βγ dimers or by tyrosine kinases, makes confident assignment of G protein identity difficult. This is especially true in model systems in which endogenous receptors and possible autocrine mechanisms further remove the measured function from the ligand binding event. Thus, although differences in signaling through Edg-1, Edg-3, and Edg-5 are recognized, the basis for the differences has only been indirectly approached. We have developed an assay for defining interactions among receptors and G proteins using Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) cells as a vehicle for biosynthetic reconstitution (47Barr A.J. Brass L.F. Manning D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2223-2229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Receptors and selected mammalian G protein α, β, and γ subunits can be co-expressed in intact Sf9 cells through infection with appropriate recombinant baculoviruses. The activation of the G protein in response to an agonist can then be analyzed in subsequently isolated membranes by facilitated exchange of GDP for [35S]GTPγS. In distinction from mammalian expression systems, Sf9 cells contain few endogenous G protein-coupled receptors, and the levels of insect G proteins are quite low relative to those that can be expressed heterologously. Using Sf9 cells and GDP/[35S]GTPγS exchange, we have characterized the coupling profiles of a variety of receptors working through Gs, Gi, Gq, and G12/13singly or in combination (47Barr A.J. Brass L.F. Manning D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2223-2229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). S1P can promote [35S]GTPγS binding in membranes expressing Edg-1, Edg-3, or Edg-5 (48Zhang G. Contos J.J.A. Weiner J.A. Fukushima N. Chun J. Gene ( Amst. ). 1999; 227: 89-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), but the differential use of G proteins by these receptors has not been directly addressed. The studies presented here were carried out to evaluate whether Edg-1 couples to G proteins beyond Gi and what the specificity of Edg-1 for various bioactive lipids might be. We were particularly interested in the question of whether the requirement for Rho ascertained previously for Edg-1 (28Lee M.J. Van Brocklyn J.R. Thangada S. Liu C.H. Hand A.R. Menzeleev R. Spiegel S. Hla T. Science. 1998; 279: 1552-1555Crossref PubMed Scopus (875) Google Scholar) could be correlated with the activation of Gq, G12, or G13. We also wished to determine whether differences in Edg-1, Edg-3, and Edg-5 signaling might be attributable to differences in the G proteins employed. S1P was obtained from both Biomol Research Laboratory (Plymouth Meeting, PA) and Sigma, and sphingosylphosphorylcholine (SPC) was obtained from Biomol Research Laboratory, Sigma, and Matreya Inc. (Pleasant Gap, PA). Other lipids, protein A-Sepharose, aprotinin, TNM-FH, activated charcoal, and normal rabbit serum were also obtained from Sigma. Pansorbin cells and Nonidet P-40 were purchased from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). [35S]GTPγS (1300 Ci/mmol) was obtained from NEN Life Science Products. Anti-FLAG M2 antibody was obtained from Kodak (New Haven, CT). Pertussis toxin was obtained from Research Biochemicals International (Natick, MA). Phenylmethylsufonyl fluoride and leupeptin were obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Fetal bovine serum was obtained from Hyclone Laboratories (Logan, UT). Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, Sf900-II, and G418 were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. Recombinant baculoviruses encoding αs-s, αi1, αq, β1, and γ2 were kindly provided by Drs. T. Kozasa and A. Gilman at Southwestern Medical Center (Dallas, TX). Those encoding αi2, αi3, and αo1 were the gift of Dr. J. Garrison at the University of Virginia (Charlottesville, VA). Those encoding α12 and α13 were the gift of Dr. N. Dhanasekaran at Temple University (Philadelphia, PA). Baculoviruses for the rat β1-adrenoreceptor and human NK-1 receptor were gifts from Drs. E. Ross at Southwestern Medical Center and T. Fong at Merck. The recombinant baculoviruses encoding αz and the human 5-HT1A receptor were reported by us previously (49Butkerait P. Zheng Y. Hallak H.

The human Edg-1 cDNA containing the FLAG epitope (32Lee M.-J. Evans M. Hla T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11272-11279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) was subcloned into the baculovirus vector from Pharmingen (San Diego, CA), and viral propagation was performed using procedures recommended by the manufacturer. The cDNAs encoding full-length human Edg-3 and rat Edg-5/H218 were subcloned from the pEdg-3/EF3 and pEdg-5/EF3, respectively (46An S. Bleu T. Zheng Y. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 787-794PubMed Google Scholar), into the pFASTBAC vector. The production of the recombinant baculoviruses was performed according to the instructions for the Bac-To-Bac baculovirus expression system (Life Technologies, Inc.). Sf9 cell culture and membrane preparation were carried out as described (47Barr A.J. Brass L.F. Manning D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2223-2229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Sf9 cells (Invitrogen) were maintained in TNM-FH + 10% charcoal-treated serum and 0.6% pluronic F-68 at 27 °C and ambient oxygen/CO2 tension. For infection with recombinant baculoviruses, cells were subcultured in monolayer and infected with combinations of baculoviruses at a mulitiplicity of infection of one for G protein subunits and two for receptors. The medium was changed to Sf900-II optimized serum-free medium after 18 h, and cells were harvested 30 h thereafter. To make membranes, harvested cells were washed three times in 0.9% saline and then homogenized in ice-cold HE/PI buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsufonyl fluoride) by 15 strokes through a 26 G needle. The homogenate was centrifuged for 5 min at 110 ×g, and the resulting supernatant was centrifuged at 20,800 × g for 30 min to pellet the membranes. The membranes were resuspended at approximately 2 mg/ml protein in HE/PI buffer for storage at −70 °C. HEK293 cells stably transfected with Edg-1 (HEK/Edg-1 cells) or empty vector (HEK/pcDNA cells) were cultured as described (28Lee M.J. Van Brocklyn J.R. Thangada S. Liu C.H. Hand A.R. Menzeleev R. Spiegel S. Hla T. Science. 1998; 279: 1552-1555Crossref PubMed Scopus (875) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% charcoal-treated fetal calf serum and 1 mg/ml G418 at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Membranes were made in essentially the same manner as for Sf9 cells. [35S]GTPγS binding was assayed essentially as described previously (47Barr A.J. Brass L.F. Manning D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2223-2229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Briefly, membranes (20 μg protein/assay point) were incubated with or without ligands (1:30, v/v) for 10 min at 30 °C in the presence of 3 mm Mg2+ and 0.1–30 μm GDP, depending on the G protein. The ligands were dissolved previously in methanol and diluted into 0.2% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin, yielding final concentrations of 0.6% methanol and 0.06% bovine serum albumin in the assay. [35S]GTPγS (final concentration, 1 or 5 nm) was subsequently added, and membranes were incubated an additional 10 min at 30 °C. Following incubation, membrane protein was solubilized with 0.5% Nonidet P-40 under nondenaturing conditions in the presence of 100 μm each of GDP and GTP, and Gαsubunits were immunoprecipitated using subunit-selective antisera, which were generated with C-terminal decapeptides (47Barr A.J.

Molinoff P.B. Manning D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18691-18699Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Nonspecific binding was determined by immunoprecipitation with nonimmune sera. Bound radioactivity was quantitated by scintillation spectrometry. Immunotransfer blotting of G protein α subunits and Edg-1 were performed as before (47Barr A.J. Brass L.F. Manning D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2223-2229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 49Butkerait P. Zheng Y. Hallak H. Graham T.E. Miller H.A. Burris K.D. Molinoff P.B. Manning D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18691-18699Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), using an anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody to recognize the epitope-tagged Edg-1. We focused in the present study initially on signals conveyed by Edg-1 and specifically on the activation of G proteins achieved through this receptor. Because most mammalian cells express a variety of receptors for bioactive lipids, we began with insect Sf9 cells as a reconstitution system. Sf9 cells provide an essentially null background for the expression of most mammalian receptors (50Windh R.T. Barr A.J. Manning D.R. Kennakin T. Angus J.A. Handbook of Experimental Pharmacology: The Pharmacology of Functional, Biochemical, and Recombinant Receptor Systems. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1999Google Scholar), which is also true for those recognizing S1P (see below). Coupling of Edg-1 and G proteins was evaluated by a [35S]GTPγS binding assay (47Barr A.J. Brass L.F. Manning D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2223-2229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), which measures GDP-GTP exchange on the Gα subunit. Membranes from Sf9 cells co-infected with combinations of baculoviruses encoding mammalian G protein subunits (α with β1 and γ2 in all cases) and Edg-1 were incubated with or without agonist in the presence of [35S]GTPγS, and C-terminal peptide-directed antisera were used to immunoprecipitate selected Gα subunits from subsequently prepared detergent extracts. The amount of [35S]GTPγS in the resulting immunoprecipitate was counted and served as a measure of G protein activation. As shown in Fig. 1 (upper panel), only a small amount of [35S]GTPγS binding was evident for Gi2 (i.e. αi2, β1, and γ2) when expressed alone in Sf9 cells, regardless of S1P. [35S]GTPγS binding was easily discerned, however, when Edg-1 was additionally introduced. Binding of [35S]GTPγS occurred to a moderate extent without S1P in this latter instance and was increased further with S1P. The agonist-independent activity was not attributable to the vehicle itself (vehicle, H2O, and no addition were equivalent) but was probably due instead to constitutive receptor activity (see “Discussion”). Similar results were observed in membranes from cells co-expressing Edg-1 with other members of the Gifamily (Gi1, Gi3, Go, and Gz; not shown). Use of nonimmune sera for immunoprecipitation, which measures nonspecific binding of [35S]GTPγS, demonstrated minimal background. Activation by S1P of Gi2 through Edg-1 proceeded in a concentration-dependent manner, with an EC50 of approximately 100 nm (Fig. 1, lower panel). The extent of activation of Gi2 by Edg-1 was comparable with that achieved by the 5-HT1A receptor, a prototypic Gi family-coupled receptor (51Innis R.B. Aghajanian G.K. Eur. J.

Perineurial tight junctions are abnormal and allow the passage of proteins and neutrophils. In nerve fibroblasts, Dhh upregulates ptc and hedgehog-interacting protein (hip). These experiments reveal a novel developmental signaling pathway between glia and mesenchymal connective tissue and demonstrate its molecular identity in peripheral nerve.

https://openalex.org/W2022104262,"Recovery from synaptic depression is believed to depend mainly on replenishment of the releasable pool of vesicles. We observed that during recovery from depression in a calyx-type synapse, part of the releasable pool was replenished rapidly. Half recovery occurred within 1 s, even in the absence of residual calcium. Vesicles that had recently entered the releasable pool had a 7- to 8-fold lower release probability than those that had been in the pool for more than 30 s. These results suggest that the reduction in the release probability of releasable vesicles contributes greatly to the level of depression. How synapses maintain transmission during repetitive firing is in debate. We propose that during repetitive firing, accumulation of intracellular Ca2+ may facilitate release of the rapidly replenished but reluctant vesicles, making them available for sustaining synaptic transmission."

Recording from 262 neurons in cortical area V4 while two rhesus macaques did a delayed match-to-sample task with oriented stimuli, we found that attention did not produce detectable changes in the variability of neuronal responses but did improve the orientation discriminability of the neurons. We also found that attention did not change the relationship between burst rate and response rate. Our results are consistent with the idea that attention selects groups of neurons for a multiplicative enhancement in response strength."

ISOC survived excision into inside-out configuration. If cell-attached patches were formed before store depletion, ISOC was activated outside but not inside the patches. ISOC was potentiated by microinjection of Clostridium C3 transferase, which inhibits Rho GTPase, whereas ISOC was inhibited by expression of wild-type or constitutively active Rho. Activation of ISOC was also inhibited by botulinum neurotoxin A and dominant-negative mutants of SNAP-25 but was unaffected by brefeldin A. These results suggest that oocyte ISOC is dependent not on aqueous diffusible messengers but on SNAP-25, probably via exocytosis of membrane channels or regulatory molecules."

Experiments using a collagen gel assay revealed that the choroid plexus repelled cerebral cortical neurons and olfactory interneuron precursors, which were mimicked by Neuro-2A cells. Fractionation of Neuro-2A-conditioned medium identified a protein of 190 kDa, equivalent to full-length Slit proteins. Indeed, it cross-reacted with an antibody against Slit2, suggesting that it is either Slit2 or another Slit protein. Further, Slit2, expressed in COS cells, repelled cerebral cortical neurons and olfactory interneuron precursors. Thus, Slit2, which is expressed by the choroid plexus and the septum, acts as a chemorepulsive factor for neuronal migration. These results suggest chemorepulsion as a guidance mechanism for neuronal migration in the developing forebrain."

It is composed of tandem, antiparallel coiled-coil repeats. We report four related crystal structures at 1.45 A, 2.0 A, 3.1 A, and 4.0 A resolution of two connected repeats of chicken brain alpha-spectrin. In all of the structures, the linker region between adjacent units is alpha-helical without breaks, kinks, or obvious boundaries. Two features observed in the structures are (1) conformational rearrangement in one repeat, resulting in movement of the position of a loop, and (2) varying degrees of bending at the linker region. These features form the basis of two different models of flexibility: a conformational rearrangement and a bending model. These models provide novel atomic details of spectrin flexibility."

It was activated with increasing Ca2+ sublinearly without inhibition even up to 200 μM. The addition of calmodulin to the cytoplasmic side inhibited the channel at high Ca2+ concentrations. Calmodulin antagonists reversed the Ca2+-dependent inactivation of the native channels in cerebellar microsomes.

https://openalex.org/W2074229391,"In the chick embryo, neural cells acquire midbrain, hindbrain, and spinal cord character over a ∼6 hr period during gastrulation. The convergent actions of four signals appear to specify caudal neural character. Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) and a paraxial mesoderm–caudalizing (PMC) activity are involved, but neither signal is sufficient to induce any single region. FGFs act indirectly by inducing mesoderm that expresses PMC and retinoid activity and also directly on prospective neural cells, in combination with PMC activity and a rostralizing signal, to induce midbrain character. Hindbrain character emerges from cells that possess the potential to acquire midbrain character upon exposure to higher levels of PMC activity. Induction of spinal cord character appears to involve PMC and retinoid activities."
https://openalex.org/W1980095812,"Localization of Ste5 to GP at the plasma membrane is essential for transmission of the pheromone signal to associated MAP kinase cascade enzymes. Here, we show that this crucial localization requires prior shuttling of Ste5 through the nucleus. Ste5 shuttles through the nucleus constitutively during vegetative growth. Pheromone enhances nuclear export of Ste5, and this pool translocates vectorially to the cell periphery. Remarkably, Ste5 that cannot transit the nucleus is unable to localize at the periphery and activate the pathway, while Ste5 with enhanced transit through the nucleus has enhanced ability to localize to the periphery and activate the pathway. This novel regulatory scheme may ensure that cytoplasmic Ste5 does not activate downstream kinases in the absence of pheromone and could be applicable to other membrane-recruited signaling proteins."

The Gfrα3−/− mice exhibited severe defects in the superior cervical ganglion (SCG), whereas other ganglia appeared normal. SCG precursor cells in the mutant embryos failed to migrate to the correct position, and they subsequently failed to innervate the target organs. In wild-type embryos, Gfrα3 was expressed in migrating SCG precursors, and artemin was expressed in and near the SCG. After birth, SCG neurons in the mutant mice underwent progressive cell death. These observations suggest that GFRα3-mediated signaling is required both for the rostral migration of SCG precursors and for the survival of mature SCG neurons."

In EGTA, the actin-activated ATPase activity of MD(2IQ) was 7.4 ± 1.6 s−1 with aK app of ∼1 μm (37 °C), and the velocity of actin movement was ∼0.3 μm/s (30 °C). Calcium inhibited both of these activities, but the addition of calmodulin restored the values to ∼70% of control, indicating that calmodulin dissociation caused inhibition. In contrast to myosin II, MD(2IQ) is highly associated with actin at physiological ionic strength in the presence of ATP, but the motor is in a weakly bound conformation based on the pyrene-actin signal. The rate of dissociation of acto-MD(2IQ) by ATP is fast (>850 s−1), and ATP hydrolysis occurs at ∼200 s−1. The affinity of acto-MD(2IQ) for ADP is somewhat higher than that of smooth S1, and ADP dissociates more slowly. Actin does not cause a large increase in the rate of ADP release, nor does the presence of ADP appreciably alter the affinity of MD(2IQ) for actin.

Their so-called “duty cycle,” i.e. the length of time the myosin spends in a force- or motion-producing state, is relatively low compared with the overall cycle time determined by the ATPase activity. This feature allows for speed of contraction, and much of the cycle is spent in a state that is dissociated from actin. In contrast, unconventional myosins are nonfilamentous, and most of these classes of myosin will probably operate in much smaller groups or potentially even individually. Because of these different functional roles, the kinetic properties of these motors are expected to be quite different from the well characterized myosin IIs. Murine myosin V is a member of the class of unconventional myosins that is implicated in organelle movement and membrane trafficking based on a number of cellular and genetic studies. Mutations in murine myosin V result in a range of defects, from impaired pigment granule movement, resulting in a dilute coat color, to a lack of smooth endoplasmic reticulum in the dendritic spines of Purkinje cells, which may be the cause of the neurological defect that results in early postnatal death (reviewed in Ref. 1Mermall V. Post P.L. Mooseker M.S. Science. 1998; 279: 527-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). Myosin V is particularly interesting from several points of view. It is a dimeric molecule that has an unusually long neck, three times that of myosin II. This region of the molecule has been proposed to act as a lever arm that ultimately results in relative sliding of actin and myosin. The neck region contains six IQ motifs that have the consensus sequence (IQXXIRGXXXR) for binding of calmodulin or myosin light chains. Thus, the potential for calcium-dependent regulation of motor activity also exists for this myosin. Because its cellular role may require it to work alone in the cell, myosin V has also been proposed to be a processive motor that undergoes multiple ATPase cycles before dissociating from its actin track. In addition, the globular tail domain beyond the coiled-coil region is believed to be the cargo-binding domain (reviewed in Ref. 1Mermall V. Post P.L. Mooseker M.S. Science. 1998; 279: 527-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). The full-length dimeric myosin V has been isolated from chick brain (2Cheney R.E. O'Shea M.K. Heuser J.E. Coelho M.V. Wolenski J.S. Espreafico E.M. Forscher P. Larson R.E. Mooseker M.S. Cell. 1993; 75: 13-23Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar), but the quantities that can be obtained are limited, precluding a detailed characterization of the molecule. The strategy we chose was to express shorter monomeric constructs of murine myosin V using the baculovirus/insect cell expression system. We then used these simpler monomeric molecules to begin our characterization of myosin V, much as proteolytic fragments of conventional myosin II have been used to obtain a wealth of information about these myosins. Here we show that the MD(2IQ)1 construct (motor domain and two IQ motifs plus two calmodulins) has the potential to be regulated by calcium but only under conditions where excess calmodulin is not present. Thus, the mechanism of inhibition appears to be dissociation of a bound calmodulin. In addition, transient kinetics were used to measure many of the elementary steps in the acto-MD(2IQ) ATPase cycle. These measurements suggest that the monomeric MD(2IQ) construct is not kinetically processive. Three constructs were analyzed here. All were derived from the murine myosin V clone (3Mercer J.A. Seperack P.K. Strobel M.C. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Nature. 1991; 349: 709-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar) (accession number X57377), which was a generous gift from Nancy Jenkins. The motor domain (MD) ends at Asp764, MD(1IQ) ends at Thr795, and MD(2IQ) ends at Thr820. A dimeric MD(2IQ) construct was made by adding the following sequences after Thr820: a 32-amino acid leucine zipper, followed by a portion of the smooth muscle myosin rod containing the S2.2 epitope. The latter piece of DNA was derived from the “0-heptad zipper” construct described by Trybus et al. (4Trybus K.M. Freyzon Y. Faust L.Z. Sweeney H.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 48-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Flag epitope (DYKDDDDK) was cloned at the C terminus of all heavy chain constructs to facilitate purification. Recombinant baculovirus encoding for the different heavy chain constructs was isolated by conventional protocols (5O'Reilly D.R. Miller L.K.L.V.A. Baculovirus Expression Vectors: A Laboratory Manual. W. H. Freeman, New York1992Google Scholar). Sf9 cells in suspension culture were infected with recombinant virus coding for the heavy chain and harvested 65–75 h later. For MD(1IQ) and MD(2IQ), there was sufficient endogenous cellular calmodulin to saturate the IQ motifs. Because calmodulin from diverse sources (chicken, rat, and human) is completely conserved at the amino acid level, we were able to infect with only one virus. Recombinant proteins were isolated on an anti-FLAG affinity column (Sigma). Typical yields were 1–1.5 mg of protein/109 Sf9 cells (300-ml suspension culture). Gel images were captured in digital format using a Kodak Digital Science DC120 zoom digital camera, and the band intensity was quantified using the Kodak Digital Science 1D image analysis software package. Actin (1 mg/ml in 10 mm imidazole, pH 7, 10 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm MgATP) was fully reduced by the addition of 2 mm DTT at pH 8 and then dialyzed overnight into 10 mm imidazole, pH 7.8, 0.1m KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mmNaN3. A 2-fold molar excess of pyrene-iodoacetamide (48 μm) (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) was added from a 4 mm stock in dimethyl formamide. After 20 h of labeling in the dark on ice, the actin was pelleted in the Beckman TL-100 at 350,000 × g for 1 h. The pellet was resuspended in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7, 0.1 m NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm NaN3, 1 mm DTT. Protein concentration was determined by Bradford reagent with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Actin-activated ATPase assays were performed at 37 °C in 10 mm imidazole, pH 7, 8 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, 1 mmNaN3 with or without 1.5 mm CaCl2. One data set was collected in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7, 0.1m NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm NaN3, 1 mm DTT at 20 °C for comparison with the transient kinetic measurements. Inorganic phosphate was determined colorimetrically (6White H.D. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 85: 698-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) at six time points per actin concentration, using SDS to stop the reaction. The motility assay was performed at 30 °C in 25 mm imidazole, pH 7.5, 25 mm KCl, 4 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 0.5% methylcellulose, 1 mm MgATP, 10 mm DTT, 3 mg/ml glucose, 0.1 mg/ml glucose oxidase, 0.018 mg/ml catalase, with or without 1.5 mm CaCl2, essentially as described in Ref. 7Warshaw D.M.

For measurements with excess calmodulin, the motility solutions also contained 0.1 mg/ml calmodulin. All kinetic experiments were done in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7, 0.1 m NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm NaN3, 1 mm DTT at 20 °C using a Kin-Tek stopped flow spectophotometer and a 100-watt mercury lamp. The concentration of MD(2IQ) was 0.5–2 μm, and when appropriate, actin was added at 1.2–1.3 times the MD2(IQ) concentration. For tryptophan fluorescence, the exciting beam was passed through a 294-nm interference filter, and the emission was detected after passing through a 340-nm interference filter. For 90° light scattering, the exciting beam was passed through a 294-nm interference filter, and the emission was detected with a 294-nm interference filter. Mant nucleotides and pyrene actin were excited using a 360-nm interference filter, and emission was detected with a 400-nm cut-off filter. Mant nucleotides (2′ or 3′) were purchased from Molecular Probes. All nucleotide stocks were prepared with an equimolar amount of magnesium. All of the transients shown are the average of three or four independent mixings. The signal averaging and fitting was done using Kin-Tek software. Note that the final concentrations of protein and nucleotide after mixing equal volumes of the two syringes are half the initial values. Single exponential data were fit to the equation y = c +a 1(exp−λ1 t), and double exponentials were fit to y = c +a 1(exp−λ1 t) +a 2(exp−λ2 t), wherec is a constant and a 1 anda 2 are the amplitudes of the signal. The data are interpreted in terms of standard schemes developed from analysis of conventional myosin II (9Taylor E.W. Crit. Rev.

MD contains only the catalytic domain (heavy chain residues 1–764). MD(1IQ) contains the motor domain plus one IQ motif for binding of calmodulin (heavy chain residues 1–795), while MD(2IQ) contains the motor domain plus 2IQ motifs (heavy chain residues 1–820) (Fig. 1). The purified MD(1IQ) and MD(2IQ) constructs have bound calmodulin, which shows its characteristic calcium-dependent shift in mobility in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig.2). The purified constructs show a stoichiometry of calmodulin/heavy chain that is consistent with the number of calmodulin-binding motifs present in the construct, within experimental error (1.3 for MD(1IQ) and 2.2 for MD(2IQ), average slope from five different gel loadings).Figure 2Expressed murine myosin V motor domain with two IQ motifs and bound calmodulin.

As expected, calcium had no effect on the activity of MD (V max = 6.3 ± 0.3 s−1, K app = 0.3 ± 0.07 μm) (Fig. 3 A). MD(1IQ) showed lower activity at subsaturating actin concentrations in the presence of calcium (V max = 8.5 ± 1.5 s−1; K app = 2.7 ± 1.0 μm) compared with that seen in EGTA (V max = 8.7 ± 0.5 s−1;K app = 1.0 ± 0.2 μm), but this was an effect on K app and not onV max (Fig. 3 B). In contrast, the activity of MD(2IQ) was high in the presence of EGTA (V max = 7.4 ± 0.6 s−1,K app = 1.2 ± 0.3 μm) and inhibited to a value of approximately 1 s−1 in the presence of calcium (Fig. 3 C). In all instances, the motor activity in the absence of actin was <0.1 s−1. The ATPase values reported here for the monomeric constructs are lower than reported for the native dimeric molecule isolated from tissue (27 s−1 in the presence of calcium) (11Nascimento A.A.C. Cheney R.E. Tauhata S.B.F. Larson R.E. Mooseker M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17561-17569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Thus, we engineered a double-headed MD(2IQ) construct that was dimerized by virtue of the addition of a leucine zipper, a strategy we have previously used (4Trybus K.M. Freyzon Y. Faust L.Z. Sweeney H.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 48-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Dimerization of our expressed construct did not increase, and in fact somewhat reduced, the activity in EGTA (V max = 3.2 ± 0.32 s−1; K app = 1.6 ± 0.4 μm). As with the monomeric MD(2IQ) construct, the addition of calcium decreased the activity (0.4 s−1). The addition of calmodulin in the presence of calcium increased the ATPase activity to ∼70% of the value in EGTA. Therefore, dimerization per se does not cause enhanced activity in calcium. Calcium could decrease the enzymatic activity of the MD(2IQ) complex either by changing the conformation of the bound calmodulin or by causing its dissociation from the heavy chain. To discriminate between these two possibilities, 12 μm exogenous calmodulin was added to the ATPase solution. The addition of calmodulin to MD(2IQ) in the presence of calcium resulted in a 10-fold activation of actin-activated ATPase activity (Table I). The simplest explanation of these data is that calmodulin dissociation from site 2 (with site 1 adjacent to the motor domain) causes the calcium-dependent decrease in activity.Table IRestoration of actin-activated ATPase activity by the addition of calmodulinEGTAEGTA + calmodulinCalciumCalcium + calmodulins−1MD(1IQ)4.15.13.44.1MD(2IQ)5.15.90.44.3Conditions were as follows: 10 mm imidazole, pH 7, 8 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mmEGTA, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm NaN3, 4 μm actin, with or without 1.5 mmCaCl2, with or without 12 μm calmodulin, 37 °C.

Dissociation of some calmodulin from the MD(2IQ) complex in the presence of calcium was also observed by an actin pelleting assay. MD(1IQ) retained all of its bound calmodulin both in the presence and absence of calcium. In contrast, MD(2IQ) released some of its calmodulin into the supernatant in the presence of calcium. Note that the protein concentration used in the pelleting assay is nearly 100-fold greater than that used for the ATPase assays, and thus it is likely that more calmodulin is dissociated during activity measurements. The motility of the MD, MD(1IQ), and MD(2IQ) constructs were examined in the presence and absence of calcium (Table II). All three constructs moved actin in the absence of calcium, whether or not exogenous calmodulin was added. There was a trend toward faster movement as the length of the neck region increased. The rate of motility of the dimerized MD(2IQ) was the same as that of the monomeric MD(2IQ).Table IIMotility of expressed constructsEGTAEGTA + calmodulinCalciumCalcium + calmodulinμm/sMD0.099 ± 0.08 (62)0.074 ± 0.03 (13)MD(1IQ)0.22 ± 0.04 (68)0.30 ± 0.04 (17)0.19 ± 0.04 (22)0.25 ± 0.05 (15)MD(2IQ)0.31 ± 0.07 (87)0.25 ± 0.06 (36)No movement0.19 ± 0.05 (12)MD(2IQ) dimeraThe MD(2IQ) construct was dimerized by the addition of a leucine zipper.

Calcium had no effect on the rates of motility for MD and MD(1IQ), consistent with the ATPase measurements, which showed no effect of calcium on V max. Paralleling the inhibition of ATPase activity observed for MD(2IQ) in the presence of calcium, no actin movement was observed under these conditions. The addition of 6 μm calmodulin to the motility solutions restored movement to levels comparable with that observed in EGTA, consistent with the restoration of ATPase activity that occurred upon the addition of exogenous calmodulin. An unusual feature of the myosin V constructs is the high degree of association with actin in the presence of MgATP, even for these monomeric constructs. Both pelleting and light scattering experiments (Fig.4) show that near physiologic ionic strength, most of the MD(2IQ) is associated with actin in the presence of MgATP. Under the same conditions, smooth or skeletal muscle myosin II would be >90% dissociated from actin. The MD(2IQ) construct was selected for further analysis by transient kinetics. TableIII summarizes the values that were obtained. All of these experiments were conducted in 10 mmHEPES, pH 7, 0.1 m NaCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mmNaN3, 1 mm DTT at 20 °C for comparison with values previously obtained for conventional muscle myosins (reviewed in Refs. 9Taylor E.W.

The maximal steady-state actin-activated ATPase for MD(2IQ) under the above conditions was 3.3 ± 0.9 s−1, with a K app ∼20 μm (note that the conditions for Fig. 3 are 8 mm KCl and 37 °C).Table IIISummary of rate constants (see Scheme FS1)ConstantNucleotideValueNucleotideValueK 1 k 2ATP7 × 105m−1 s−1Mant-ATP7 × 105m−1 s−1K 1A k 2AATP7 × 105m−1 s−1Mant-ATP6 × 105m−1 s−1k dATP850 s−1k 3 + k 3ATP200 s−1K 4 k 5Mant-ADP4 × 106m−1 s−1,4 × 105m−1s−1K 4A k 5AMant-ADP4 × 106m−1 s−1,4 × 105m−1s−1k −5ADP8–12 s−1Mant-ADP0.6 s−1k −5AADP13–22 s−1Mant-ADP17–19 s−1Conditions are as follows: 10 mm HEPES, pH 7, 0.1m NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mmEGTA, 1 mm NaN3, 1 mm DTT at 20 °C.

The rate of nucleotide binding to MD(2IQ) was followed by the increase in intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence (Fig.5). At low ATP concentrations, the rate of the transient increased linearly with ATP, definingK 1 k 2 (Scheme FS1) as 7 × 105m−1 s−1. Fiting the data to a hyperbola gave a a maximum rate of 198 ± 13 s−1, which is likely to be a measure of the rate of the hydrolysis step (k 3 +k −3), by analogy with studies on other myosins where the maximum rate of the fluorescence change has been equated with the rate of ATP cleavage determined by quench flow measurements (12Johnson K.A. Taylor E.W. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 3432-3442Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The amplitude of the fluorescence signal decreased from 5% at low ATP concentrations to 3% at high ATP concentrations. This pattern is consistent with a two-step binding scheme, with approximately half of the fluorescence change attributed to binding and the other half to hydrolysis. Binding of ADP caused no change in fluorescence. The source of the tryptophan(s) that contribute to the change upon nucleotide binding would be expected to be conserved among various myosins. The MD(2IQ) construct has eight tryptophan residues, seven of which are in the catalytic domain. Two of these Trp residues are conserved between smooth, skeletal, Dictyostelium, and myosin V; they are equivalent to Trp441 and Trp512 in the smooth muscle numbering system. The varying amplitude of the signal enhancement seen with different myosins may reflect variable contributions of the nonconserved Trp residues to the base-line signal, since their level of fluorescence is dependent on their environment. Fluorescent nucleotides have proved to be a useful way of determining the rate of nucleotide binding to myosins, particularly when the intrinsic tryptophan signal is small or nonexistent. Similar to other myosins, nucleotide binding to MD(2IQ) caused an increase in mant fluorescence. The rate of mant-ATP binding to MD(2IQ) was similar to that determined for ATP, with an apparent second order rate constant of 7 × 105m−1 s−1 (Fig.6 C, open circles). The use of the fluorescent nucleotide also allowed the value for mant-ADP binding to be determined, for which there was no corresponding intrinsic tryptophan signal. The signal was biphasic, with the rate as a function of nucleotide concentration defining apparent second order rate constants of 4 × 106m−1 s−1 and 4 × 105m−1 s−1 (Fig.6 A, open circles). The rate of mant-ADP and mant-ATP binding to acto-MD(2IQ) was also determined (Fig. 6, A and C, filled circles). Binding of mant-ATP fit a single exponential signal (Fig. 6 D), while binding of mant-ADP was best fit by two exponentials (Fig. 6 B). The values that were obtained were very similar to those obtained in the absence of actin, implying that actin has little effect on the rate at which nucleotide binds. Because ATP but not ADP binding caused a change in tryptophan fluorescence, this signal could be used to determine the rate of ADP release from MD(2IQ). 1 μm MD(2IQ) with varying ADP concentration (4–14 μm) was mixed with 400 μm ATP. The single exponential rise in fluorescence that was observed occurred at a rate of approximately 8–12 s−1, much lower than the ∼100 s−1 determined at this ATP concentration in the absence of ADP (Fig. 7 A). Thus, ADP dissociates from MD(2IQ) at approximately 10 s−1(k −5). The rate of mant-ADP release from MD(2IQ), determined by mixing MD(2IQ) and 14 μm mant-ADP with 1 mm ATP, was 0.6 s−1, an order of magnitude slower than observed for ADP. The dissociation constant of mant-ADP for MD(2IQ), estimated from the ratio of off to on rate constants is ∼0.2 μm (0.6 s−1/4 × 106m−1s−1). If the rate of binding of ADP and mant-ADP to MD(2IQ) is similar, mant-ADP would bind tighter to MD(2IQ) than ADP does because of a reduced rate of nucleotide release. A 10-fold tighter binding of mant-ADP compared with ADP was observed with both smooth and skeletal S1 (13Cremo C.R. Geeves M.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1969-1978Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Light scattering was used to determine the rate of dissociation of acto-MD(2IQ) by ATP (Fig. 8). One μmacto-MD(2IQ) was mixed with increasing concentrations of ATP. The apparent second order rate constant for binding (K 1A k 2A) was 7 × 105m−1s−1. There was little deviation from a straight line until quite high ATP concentrations, but the extrapolated value estimated from a fit to a hyperbola was approximately 850 s−1. This value could be an underestimate of the maximum rate of dissociation (k d). Three different signals were used for measuring the rate of ADP release from acto-MD(2IQ). The first method, which used pyrene-labeled actin, also allowed one to determine the affinity of ADP for acto-MD(2IQ). The fluorescence of pyrene-labeled actin is quenched when it is tightly bound to the motor domain. Binding of ATP causes an increase in fluorescence, while binding of ADP causes no change in fluorescence (Fig.9 A). When the MD(2IQ)·ADP complex (0–16 μm ADP) is mixed with 1 mmMgATP, the increase in fluorescence is biphasic (Fig. 9 A), with the amplitude of the fast phase decreasing and the amplitude of the slow phase increasing with ADP concentration (Fig. 9 B). The fast phase is due to binding of ATP to pyrene-acto-MD(2IQ) that has no ADP bound, while the slow phase is due to binding of ATP to pyrene-acto-MD(2IQ) that has ADP bound. The amplitude dependence of the signal fitted a hyperbola with a midpoint ∼2 μm, reflecting the affinity of acto-MD(2IQ) for ADP (K AD). The rate of the slow phase, either when the transient was fitted to two exponentials or at higher ADP when the transient was fitted to a single exponential, was between 13.5 and 14.5 s−1, which is the rate of ADP release from acto-MD(2IQ) (k −5A). Light scattering was the second method used to measure the rate of ADP release. The acto-MD(2IQ)·ADP complex was mixed with ATP. The ADP concentration was 5–60 μm, severalfold higher than the dissociation constant, and the ATP concentration was 1 mm, so that the rate at which it binds to and dissociates the acto-MD(2IQ) complex is fast compared with the rate of ADP release. The light scattering decrease occurred at a rate of approximately 17–22 s−1 (k −5A) (Fig.7 B), compared with greater than 200 s−1 in the absence of ADP at this ATP concentration. This value also defines the rate at which ADP dissociates from acto-MD(2IQ) (k −5A). The above experiment was repeated with mant-ADP bound to acto-MD(2IQ). The signal was the decrease in mant fluorescence as the fluorescent nucleotide dissociated from the active site and was replaced with nonfluorescent ATP. The rate of the fluorescence decrease was in the range of 17–19 s−1, in good agreement with the value obtained by light scattering. Thus, ADP and mant-ADP have similar rates of dissociation from acto-MD(2IQ), in contrast to the different rates of dissociation they have from MD(2IQ). This pattern of behavior was also observed for smooth and skeletal S1 (13Cremo C.R. Geeves M.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1969-1978Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). An apparent second order rate constant of 6–11 × 106m−1 s−1 for ADP binding to acto-MD(2IQ) is predicted from a dissociation constant of 2 μm and an off rate of 13–22 s−1 (13–22 s−1/2 μm). The equilibrium dissociation constant of actin for MD(2IQ) and for MD(2IQ)·ADP was determined in the stopped flow (K Aand K DA in Scheme FS2). Phalloidin-stabilized pyrene-actin (30 nm) was incuba"

We have chemically synthesized a series of substituted benzo[c]quinolizinium (MPB) compounds. Among them, 6-hydroxy-7-chlorobenzo[c]quinolizinium (MPB-27) and 6-hydroxy-10-chlorobenzo[c]quinolizinium (MPB-07), which we show to be potent and selective activators of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) chloride channel. We examined the effect of MPB compounds on the activity of CFTR channels in a variety of established epithelial and nonepithelial cell systems. Using the iodide efflux technique, we show that MPB compounds activate CFTR chloride channels in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells stably expressing CFTR but not in CHO cells lacking CFTR. Single and whole cell patch clamp recordings from CHO cells confirm that CFTR is the only channel activated by the drugs. Ussing chamber experiments reveal that the apical addition of MPB to human nasal epithelial cells produces a large increase of the short circuit current. This current can be totally inhibited by glibenclamide. Whole cell experiments performed on native respiratory cells isolated from wild type and CF null mice also show that MPB compounds specifically activate CFTR channels. The activation of CFTR by MPB compounds was glibenclamide-sensitive and 4,4′-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid-insensitive. In the human tracheal gland cell line MM39, MPB drugs activate CFTR channels and stimulate the secretion of the antibacterial secretory leukoproteinase inhibitor. In submandibular acinar cells, MPB compounds slightly stimulate CFTR-mediated submandibular mucin secretion without changing intracellular cAMP and ATP levels. Similarly, in CHO cells MPB compounds have no effect on the intracellular levels of cAMP and ATP or on the activity of various protein phosphatases (PP1, PP2A, PP2C, or alkaline phosphatase). Our results provide evidence that substituted benzo[c]quinolizinium compounds are a novel family of activators of CFTR and of CFTR-mediated protein secretion and therefore represent a new tool to study CFTR-mediated chloride and secretory functions in epithelial tissues.

We have chemically synthesized molecules and tested them using an iodide efflux assay adapted for the study of CFTR channels in stably transfected Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. Selected compounds were then evaluated for actions on chloride transport, secretion of serous proteins, and mucins within a consortium of seven laboratories, and results were collected and compared.

To our knowledge, this strategy is the first to be reported in the field of the pharmacology of chloride channels.

Cells grown for 4 days in 12-well plates were washed twice with 2 ml of modified Earle's salt solution (solution B) containing 137 mm NaCl, 5.36 mm KCl, 0.4 mmNa2HPO4, 0.8 mm MgCl2,1.8 mm CaCl2, 5.5 mm glucose, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. Cells were then incubated in B medium containing 1 μm KI (1 μCi of Na125I/ml, NEN Life Science Products) for 30 min at 37 °C. After washing, cells were incubated with 1 ml of solution B. After 1 min, the medium was removed to be counted and was quickly replaced by 1 ml of the same medium. This procedure was repeated every 1 min for 11 min. The first two aliquots were used to establish a stable base line in efflux buffer alone. B medium containing the appropriate drug was used for the remaining aliquots. At the end of the incubation, the medium was recovered, and cells were solubilized in 1 n NaOH. The radioactivity was determined using a γ-counter (LKB). The total amount of 125I (in cpm) at time 0 was calculated as the sum of cpm counted in each 1-min sample plus the cpm in the NaOH fraction. The fraction of initial intracellular 125I lost during each time point was determined, and time-dependent rates of125I efflux were calculated according to Venglarik et al. (25Venglarik C.J.

Data are presented as the mean ± S.E. of n separate experiments. Whole cell currents were recorded with an RK300 patch-clamp amplifier (Biologic, France). The current-voltage relationships were determined from step voltage protocols. The membrane potential was first held at −40 mV and then voltage-clamped over the range ±80 mV in steps of 20 mV. Currents were low pass-filtered at 3.3 kHz, digitized on-line at 4 kHz, and stored on the computer hard disk. They were analyzed off-line with the pCLAMP 5.5.1 software package (pCLAMP, Axon Instruments). Pipettes with resistance of 2–5 megaohms were pulled from borosilicate glass capillary tubing (GC150-TF10, Clark Electromedical Inc., Reading, UK) using a two-step vertical puller (Narishige, Japan). They were connected to the head stage of the amplifier through an Ag/AgCl pellet. Seal resistance ranging from 3 to 30 gigaohms were obtained. The pipette solution contained 145 mm CsCl, 5 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 10 mm EGTA, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.2). The external solution consists of 150 mm NaCl, 2 mmCaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, 10 mmHEPES (pH 7.4). All experiments were performed at room temperature. Cells were stimulated with forskolin or an appropriate compound (dissolved in Me2SO; final Me2SO concentration 0.1%) at the concentration indicated under “Results.” In control experiments, the currents were not altered by Me2SO. Mice of either sex from a Balb/c breeding colony at the University of Newcastle upon Tyne or transgenic CF null mice (26Ratcliff R.M. Evans M.J. Cuthbert A.W. MacVinish L.J. Foster D. Anderson J.R. Colledge W.H. Nat. Genet. 1993; 4: 35-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar) were used for these experiments (three wild type and two CF null animals). Ciliated respiratory cells were obtained using an isolation technique that has been fully described previously (27Tarran R. Gray M.A. Evans M.J. Colledge W.H. Ratcliff R. Argent B.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C904-C913Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, nasal epithelium was incubated with 0.05% protease XIV (Sigma) for 24–30 h at 4 °C, and single ciliated respiratory cells were teased from the epithelium (27Tarran R. Gray M.A. Evans M.J. Colledge W.H. Ratcliff R. Argent B.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C904-C913Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our criteria for cell viability were (i) a clear, bright, phase-contrast image and (ii) beating cilia (27Tarran R. Gray M.A. Evans M.J. Colledge W.H. Ratcliff R. Argent B.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C904-C913Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Patch clamp recordings were made at room temperature either from single cells or small groups of cells (≤7). Whole cell currents were recorded with an EPC-7 patch-clamp amplifier (List Electronic, Darmstadt, Germany). To obtain I/V relationships, the membrane potential was held at 0 mV and then voltage-clamped over the range ±80 mV in steps of 20 mV with each voltage step lasting 500 ms. Data were filtered at 1 kHz and sampled at 2 kHz with a Cambridge Electronic Design 1401 interface (CED, Cambridge, UK) and stored on the computer hard disk. The input capacitance of the cells was measured using the analogue circuitry of the amplifier and used to calculate current density which is expressed as pA/pF. Junction potentials were measured, and the appropriate corrections were applied to Vm. The pipette solution contained 120 mm N-methyl-d-glutamine-Cl, 2 mmMgCl2, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mm ATP, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.2 (calculated free Ca2+concentration <1 nm). The standard bath solution contained 149.5 mm N-methyl-d-glutamine Cl, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm glucose, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. As we have previously found for murine pancreatic duct cells (28Gray M.A. Winpenny J.P. Porteous D.J. Dorin J.R. Argent B.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: C213-C221Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), in order to detect CFTR currents, airway cells had to be pretreated with forskolin (1 μm), dibutyryl cAMP (100 μm), and 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (100 μm) before whole cell recording was established. Preliminary experiments showed that CFTR currents were only detected if the cAMP stimulants were included in the protease solution used to isolate the respiratory cells (24–30 h at 4 °C). An identical protocol was employed for the MPB compounds. Cells remained viable after exposure to the MPB compound as judged by the criteria listed above. Significance of difference between means was determined using analysis of variance followed by Dunn's multiple comparison test. The significance of difference between the number of cells responding to a particular maneuver was assessed using the χ2 test. The level of significance was set at p ≤ 0.05. All values are expressed as mean ± S.E. (number of observations). The method for the primary culture of nasal epithelial cells has been described elsewhere (29Yamaya M. Finkbeiner W.E. Chun S.Y. Widdicombe J.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: L713-L724Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Galietta L.J.V. Musante L. Romio L. Caruso U. Fantasia A. Gazzolo A. Romano L. Sacco O. Rossi G.A. Varesio L. Zegarra-Moran O. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: L917-L923PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, nasal polyps were digested overnight in a solution containing protease XIV. Detached epithelial cells were seeded at high density (3 × 106cells/cm2) on Snapwell (Costar) permeable supports. Culture medium was Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 (1:1) plus 5% fetal calf serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin for the first 24 h. Subsequently, this medium was replaced with one containing 2% Ultroser G (Life Technologies, Inc.) instead of fetal calf serum. Ussing chamber experiments were performed 4–5 days after cell seeding. At this time, cell monolayers displayed a transepithelial potential difference of −52.4 ± 1.7 mV and an electrical resistance of 1007 ± 36 ohms · cm2. The Snapwell cups were mounted in a modified Ussing chamber (Costar) filled on both sides with 5 ml of a Krebs bicarbonate solution containing 126 mmNaCl, 0.38 mm KH2PO4, 2.13 mm K2HPO4, 1 mmMgSO4, 1 mm CaCl2, 24 mm NaHCO3, 10 mm glucose, and 0.04 mm phenol red. During the experiments, this solution was continuously bubbled with 5% CO2, 95% air and kept at 37 °C. The epithelium was short circuited with a voltage clamp (558-C5, Bioengineering, The University of Iowa) connected to apical and basolateral chambers with Ag/AgCl electrodes. The potential difference and the fluid resistance between potential sensing electrodes was compensated. The short circuit current (I sc) was recorded simultaneously on a chart recorder (L6512, Linseis) and a computer Power Macintosh equipped with a MacLab/200 converter. Methods for isolating preparations of rat submandibular acini and for measurement of mucin secretion have been described elsewhere (6Lloyd Mills C. Pereira M.M.C. Dormer R.L. McPherson M.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 188: 1146-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 31Pereira M.M.C. Lloyd Mills C. Dormer R.L. McPherson M.A. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 125: 697-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Briefly, acini were pulse-chase-labeled with [3H]glucosamine (5 μCi/ml), suspended in KHB containing 20 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and incubated under experimental conditions at 37 °C. [3H]glucosamine-labeled mucins, released into the medium at zero time and after 60 min, were acid-precipitated using a combination of 10% trichloroacetic acid and 0.5% phosphotungstic acid. The precipitates were washed, and their radioactivity was measured as described. The majority of the radioactivity in the trichloroacetic acid/phosphotungstic acid precipitate has characteristics of mucin in both basal and stimulated rat submandibular acinar cell secretions (31Pereira M.M.C. Lloyd Mills C. Dormer R.L. McPherson M.A. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 125: 697-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The protein content of cell pellets was determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay kit, and mucin release is expressed as a percentage of basal secretion to take account of variation in unstimulated mucin release between experiments. For cAMP and ATP measurement, acini were incubated for 5 and 60 min, respectively, at 37 °C in the presence or absence of test compounds. Aliquots of acini suspensions (0.25 ml) were added to an equal volume of ice-cold trichloroacetic acid (20%), extracted and assayed using a specific radioimmunoassay kit for cAMP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and a luminometric assay using firefly luciferin-luciferase for ATP, as described previously (6Lloyd Mills C. Pereira M.M.C. Dormer R.L. McPherson M.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 188: 1146-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W2027568735,"TGF-β-stimulatedclone-22 (TSC-22) encodes a leucine zipper-containing protein that is highly conserved during evolution. Two homologues are known that share a similar leucine zipper domain and another conserved domain (designated the TSC box). Only limited data are available on the function of TSC-22 and its homologues. TSC-22 is transcriptionally up-regulated by many different stimuli, including anti-cancer drugs and growth inhibitors, and recent data suggest that TSC-22 may play a suppressive role in tumorigenesis. In this paper we show that TSC-22 forms homodimers via its conserved leucine zipper domain. Using a yeast two-hybrid screen, we identified a TSC-22 homologue (THG-1) as heterodimeric partner. Furthermore, we report the presence of two more mammalian family members with highly conserved leucine zippers and TSC boxes. Interestingly, both TSC-22 and THG-1 have transcriptional repressor activity when fused to a heterologous DNA-binding domain. The repressor activity of TSC-22 appears sensitive for promoter architecture, but not for the histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A. Mutational analysis showed that this repressor activity resides in the non-conserved regions of the protein and is enhanced by the conserved dimerization domain. Our results suggest that TSC-22 belongs to a family of leucine zipper-containing transcription factors that can homodimerize and heterodimerize with other family members and that at least two TSC-22 family members may be repressors of transcription.

Parkinson J.S. Bourret R.B. Cell. 1996; 86: 845-848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Downstream of the HPK is a cognate response regulator protein that also possesses a receiver domain, phosphorylation of which modulates the activity of the response regulator. Communication between the two receiver domains occurs via a histidine phosphotransfer protein (HPt), which acts as a histidine-phosphorylated intermediary allowing phosphate to be shuttled between the conserved aspartate residues of the two receiver domains. In bacteria, the HPt moiety can be fused to the C terminus of a hybrid HPK, as with ArcB or BvgS for example, or be a separate protein, such as LuxU (1Appleby J.L. Parkinson J.S. Bourret R.B.

In eukaryotes, the only characterized HPt protein is Ypd1 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which like LuxU, is a separate protein (2Freeman J.A. Bassler B.L. J.

The osmo-sensing pathway of S. cerevisiae is the best understood of the two eukaryotic phospho-relays so far characterized (they are both present in yeast and share components) (3Posas F.

It consists of the histidine protein kinase Sln1, the histidine phosphotransfer protein Ypd1, and the response regulator Ssk1. The catalytic domain of Sln1 is thought to trans-phosphorylate the H-domain of another Sln1 monomer within an HPK dimer complex. The Sln1 receiver domain acquires the phosphate at a conserved aspartate residue and relays it to the Ypd1 H-domain. Lastly, the receiver domain of Ssk1 dephosphorylates Ypd1, transferring the phosphate onto itself. Genetic analyses have shown that the unphosphorylated form of Ssk1 is the active species (4Posas F. Saito H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1385-1394Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). The Ssk1 response regulator controls activity of the HOG mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway in S. cerevisiae, by acting as a direct regulator of the Ssk2 mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase (3Posas F.

On starvation, individual cells begin to secrete pulses of cAMP, which acts as a ligand for a family of G-protein-coupled receptors. Receptor activation leads to the production of second messengers including cGMP and cAMP (17Parent C.A. Devreotes P.N. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 411-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). A large proportion of the cAMP is probably exported from the cell to continue intercellular signaling; levels of external cAMP are regulated by the secreted phosphodiesterase, PdsA (18Lacombe M.L. Podgorski G.J. Franke J. Kessin R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 16811-16817Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). cAMP also acts inside the cell to control the activity of PKA (19Firtel R.A. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1996; 6: 545-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Recently an intracellular cAMP PDE has been discovered (8Shaulsky G. Fuller D. Loomis W.F.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2838-2845Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). This enzyme, RegA, serves a critical function in controlling the rate ofDictyostelium development, because a regA null mutant develops rapidly and produces spores prematurely, similar to therdeC mutants (which lack functional PKA R-subunit) (7Shaulsky G. Escalante R. Loomis W.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15260-15265Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 8Shaulsky G. Fuller D. Loomis W.F.

Kay R.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2838-2845Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar,20Abe K. Yanagisawa K. Dev. Biol. 1983; 95: 200-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 21Chang W.T.

Cell. 1977; 10: 703-708Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) The RegA phosphodiesterase probably acts to restrain the activity of PKA during development, because dominant negative mutations of PKA are epistatic to a regA mutation (8Shaulsky G. Fuller D. Loomis W.F. Development. 1998; 125: 691-699Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Thomason P.A. Traynor D. Cavet G. Chang W.-T. Harwood A.J. Kay R.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2838-2845Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). rdeA mutants have elevated cAMP levels, as doregA mutants, consistent with RegA phosphodiesterase activity being lowered in rdeA mutants (20Abe K. Yanagisawa K. Dev. Biol. 1983; 95: 200-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 23Kim H.-J. Chang W.-T. Meima M. Gross J.D. Schaap P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30859-30862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). A biochemical connection between RdeA, RegA, and the adenylyl cyclase ACB has recently been suggested on the basis of genetic studies and the use of a PDE inhibitor (23Kim H.-J. Chang W.-T. Meima M. Gross J.D. Schaap P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30859-30862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The rdeA gene encodes a 254-amino acid protein with little overall sequence similarity to any other protein. However, RdeA does show homology to histidine phosphotransfer proteins in a 20-amino acid region in its N-terminal half. This region includes a predicted site of histidine phosphorylation, His65, a residue essential for RdeA function in vivo (21Chang W.T. Thomason P.A. Gross J.D. Newell P.C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2809-2816Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The S. cerevisiae YPD1 gene, which encodes a known HPt protein, complements a Dictyostelium rdeA mutant (21Chang W.T. Thomason P.A. Gross J.D. Newell P.C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2809-2816Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The N-terminal receiver domain of RegA has been shown to control its PDE activity in vitro: phosphorylation of aspartate 212 in the receiver domain activates the PDE domain. It is not known, however, whether RegA activity is controlled by the receiver domain in the cell, and if so, in what manner. We present results showing that RegA phosphorylated on its receiver domain in vivo is in an activated state. In light of the suggestion that RdeA and RegA function on the same pathway to control cAMP levels, we investigated whether RdeA is an upstream activator of RegA. We present phospho-transfer evidence that this is indeed the case. Furthermore, we show that RegA can be activated by phospho-transfer from an H-domain protein in vitro. Cells were grown and developed at 22 °C (24Watts D.J. Ashworth J.M. Biochem. J. 1970; 119: 171-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar). Expression plasmids were introduced into cells by electroporation using a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser (0.9 kV, 3 microfarad). Transformants were selected at 20 μg/ml G418 and stably maintained at 5 μg/ml G418 in axenic culture. Cells were developed on KK2-agar (20 mmK1K2PO4 + 2 mmMgSO4; 1.8% Oxoid L28 agar) at a density of 1.6 × 106 cm−2. For spore counts, developing structures were disrupted by syringing in KK2 buffer + 0.3% cemulsol. Detergent-resistant spores were scored by microscopy and plated out for viability after washing. Restriction enzymes and T4 DNA ligase were from New England Biolabs. A rescue plasmid carrying theregA gene positioned in-frame downstream of its own promoter has been described (9Thomason P.A. Traynor D. Cavet G. Chang W.-T. Harwood A.J. Kay R.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2838-2845Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The D212N mutant regA cDNA was used to replace the wild type cDNA in this construct (usingBamHI-XhoI) to give plasmid pPT17. These constructs were used to “rescue” the regA null strain HM1015, giving strains HM2040 (with wild type cDNA) and HM2049 (with D212N cDNA), respectively. The receiver domain of RegA (the region covering amino acids 126–316 was used) was amplified from either the wild type or D212N mutant cDNA by polymerase chain reaction, using oligonucleotides containing a BamHI site (5′ primer) and EcoRI site (3′ primer). This DNA was cloned into an actin15 expression vector possessing an in-frame Myc3 tag at the 3′ end of the insert to give plasmids pPT46 (WT) and pPT43 (D212N). The Myc tag encoded three copies of the amino acid sequence: EQKLISEEDLG. The plasmids were transformed into Ax2 cells to give strains HM2046 (with WT receiver) and HM2047 (with D212N receiver), respectively. The rdeA cDNA was amplified by polymerase chain reaction and cloned into the bacterial expression vector pGEX-5X1 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at the BamHI and XhoI sites (giving plasmid pPT15). GST fusion proteins were prepared from isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside-inducedEscherichia coli BL21 by standard methods. The purity of the final proteins was about 75%, estimated by Coomassie staining. The rdeA cDNA was mutagenized to create H63Q and H65Q mutants using the QuikchangeTM method (Stratagene). The mutagenized rdeA inserts were transferred to pGEX-5X1 for bacterial expression (plasmids pPT39 (H63Q) and pPT40 (H65Q)). All constructs were confirmed free of errors by DNA sequencing (ABI377). Radiochemicals were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. GST fusion proteins were used at 10 μm equivalent. Labeling with acetyl-[32P]phosphate was as before (9Thomason P.A. Traynor D. Cavet G. Chang W.-T. Harwood A.J. Kay R.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2838-2845Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar); reactions were for 30 min. Proteins were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) (performed at 4 °C) and then transferred to Immobilon P membrane (Millipore) by electroblotting (at 4 °C). Membrane was exposed to a PhosphorImager screen and then stained with Coomassie Blue to localize proteins. Phosphorylation of RdeA or CheA H-domain by CheA catalytic domain was done at pH 8.0 in 50 mm Tris-Cl, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, containing 10 μm ATP (for RdeA) or 0.2 mm ATP (for CheA H-domain) and [γ-32P]ATP, for 2 h at 25 °C, in a volume of 50 μl. Free ATP was removed by spun column gel filtration using Sepharose G50. For phospho-transfer reactions, all proteins were used at 10 μm. Preparation of the catalytic and H-domains of CheA has been described (25Levit M. Liu Y. Surette M. Stock J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32057-32063Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). H-domain (1–200 μm) was phosphorylated by CheA catalytic domain as above but without radiolabeled ATP. RegA (WT or D212N mutant) and cAMP substrate was added to the prephosphorylated H-domain, and phosphodiesterase activity was determined in a standard assay (9Thomason P.A. Traynor D. Cavet G. Chang W.-T. Harwood A.J. Kay R.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2838-2845Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The amount of phospho-H present at the start of the PDE assay was assessed by performing parallel phosphorylation reactions containing [γ-32P]ATP and measuring the incorporation of radiolabel into H-domain (correction was made for purity of the labeled ATP). For PDE activity measurements, initial rates were used. For determination of specific activities of RegA proteins, PDE assays were performed with 200 μm cAMP as substrate (K m = 5 μm approximately). PDE assays were performed as described (9Thomason P.A. Traynor D. Cavet G. Chang W.-T. Harwood A.J. Kay R.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2838-2845Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar); briefly, reactions were performed in 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, at 25 °C for 30 min. Protein amounts were assessed by SDS-PAGE followed by gel densitometry, against a bovine serum albumin standard curve. Polyclonal anti-RegA antiserum (R1/2F) was the primary antibody, used at 1:5,000 final dilution. The secondary antibody was goat anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Bio-Rad), used at 1:12,500 dilution. Detection was by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Bands were quantitated by densitometry (Molecular Dynamics). RegA phosphodiesterase activity is stimulated by phosphorylation in vitro. A mutant version of RegA in which the predicted site of phosphorylation in the receiver domain, Asp212, has been replaced by asparagine is neither phosphorylated nor activated (9Thomason P.A. Traynor D. Cavet G. Chang W.-T. Harwood A.J. Kay R.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2838-2845Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). To determine whether RegA activity in living cells is similarly regulated through aspartate phosphorylation, we compared the effects of expressing wild type and D212N mutant RegA in the regA null strain HM1015. Transformed cell lines were grown in axenic culture and plated on non-nutrient agar to initiate development. The rate of development of these various strains was followed by the appearance of detergent-resistant spores. In the wild type, these appear at 21–24 h, but in the regA null mutant this is brought forward to about 14 h. When wild type regA is expressed in a regA null background under the control of its own promoter (Prom::WT), it restores normal timing of development (Fig.1 A). In contrast, expression of the D212N mutant version of RegA (Prom::DN) only slightly delays spore production (by 1–2 h) relative to the regAnull mutant (Fig. 1 A). Essentially similar results are obtained when RegA expression is driven from the strong actin15 promoter (A15::DN and A15::WT, respectively). For A15::DN, spores are produced at about 20–22 h of development, whereas in A15::WT spore production does not occur until 42–48 h of development (results not shown). In these experiments, the expression levels of the wild type and mutant forms of RegA are an important factor. Fig. 1 B shows that when expressed from the RegA promoter, D212N and WT RegA have similar, though not precisely the same, expression levels, as monitored by Western blotting and densitometry. RegA expression appears to be biphasic in these strains, declining from high, steady levels to a lower level prior to culmination and then increasing again as maturation continues (Fig. 1 B). In the Prom::D212N strain, the phase of this expression is shifted forward by about 5 h relative to the Prom::WT strain, possibly as a consequence of the rapid development of the Prom::D212N strain. The ability of WT RegA to delay development more strongly than D212N RegA cannot, therefore, be due simply to expression differences between the two versions of the enzyme. The level of RegA expressed in these two strains is approximately 5-fold higher than that of endogenous RegA present in wild type Ax2 cells. When RegA expression is driven from the strong actin15 promoter, however, RegA levels reach about 25-fold those present in wild type cells (data not shown), i.e. a further increase of 5-fold. Thus, the finding that the A15::DN strain has very similar timing of spore production to the Prom::WT strain supports further the hypothesis that RegA D212N is less active than RegA WTin vivo. On Western blots, RegA appears as a doublet consisting of a strong upper band and a more minor lower band, in roughly constant proportions. Neither band occurs in a regAnull strain (9Thomason P.A. Traynor D. Cavet G. Chang W.-T. Harwood A.J. Kay R.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2838-2845Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). This pattern may represent a modification such as proteolytic processing or phosphorylation. Because both bands are also present in the D212N RegA-expressing strains (e.g. Fig.1 B), this cannot be due to Asp212 phosphorylation. The finding that D212N RegA causes some rescue of theregA null phenotype indicates that RegA PDE activity is not entirely dependent on Asp212 phosphorylation. To confirm this finding in vitro, the specific activities of WT and D212N RegA were determined. Both forms of the enzyme have PDE activityin vitro, and the specific activity of each (in the absence of phosphorylation) is approximately 0.08 μmol/min/mg protein (at 25 °C). When RegA receiver domain is overexpressed in wild type Ax2 cells, it acts as a dominant negative (9Thomason P.A. Traynor D. Cavet G. Chang W.-T. Harwood A.J. Kay R.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2838-2845Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). To determine whether the Asp212 predicted site of phosphorylation is required for this effect, Myc-tagged versions of the receiver domain were expressed in Ax2 cells under control of the actin15 promoter. Expression of the receiver domains was confirmed by Western blotting for the C-terminal Myc epitope (not shown). The wild type receiver domain (strain HM2046) behaved as a dominant negative, as expected; development in this strain was rapid and spore production precocious (results not shown), similar to previous findings (9Thomason P.A. Traynor D. Cavet G. Chang W.-T. Harwood A.J. Kay R.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2838-2845Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Expression of the D212N receiver domain (strain HM2047) had no effect on the development of Ax2 (not shown), showing that Asp212 is essential for the dominant negative action. The above results indicate that RegA functions as a response regulator whose activity in the cell is controlled by phosphorylation. The immediate upstream phosphate donor for the RegA receiver domain is likely to be a HPt protein (1Appleby J.L. Parkinson J.S. Bourret R.B. Cell. 1996; 86: 845-848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Genetic evidence suggests that the RdeA protein may serve this function (see the Introduction). To investigate whether there is communication between RdeA and RegA,in vitro phospho-transfer between the two proteins was investigated. For this, the ability of some receiver domains to specifically autophosphorylate using the artificial phospho-donor acetyl phosphate was exploited (26Lukat G.S. McCleary W.R. Stock A.M. Stock J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 718-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). Bacterially expressed (GST-fused) RegA receiver domain was incubated with acetyl [32P]phosphate, resulting in phosphorylation (Fig.2, lane 1). Phosphorylation required Asp212, because the D212N mutant protein was not phosphorylated (lane 2; as reported previously (9Thomason P.A. Traynor D. Cavet G. Chang W.-T. Harwood A.J. Kay R.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2838-2845Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar)), nor were three versions of (GST-) RdeA (wild type, H63Q control mutant, and H65Q mutant, lanes 3–5). Addition of wild type or H63Q RdeA to acetyl [32P]phosphate, together with wild type receiver domain, resulted in the appearance of [32P] label on RdeA (lanes 6–7). RdeA phosphorylation was dependent on residue His65 of RdeA, because a H65Q mutant version did not become labeled under these conditions (lane 8). Labeling of wild type RdeA required the presence of wild type receiver domain, because the D212N version did not support phosphorylation of RdeA from acetyl phosphate (lane 9). Phospho-transfer to RdeA also occurred when purified phospho-receiver domain (which had been separated away from acetyl phosphate by gel filtration) was added to RdeA (data not shown). These results show that RdeA can be phosphorylated on His65 by a phospho-transfer mechanism dependent on Asp212 of the RegA receiver domain. In the proposed linear phospho-relay scheme, this represents reverse phospho-relay. Similar in vitro reverse transfer is seen between the Spo0B and Spo0F proteins of the Bacillus subtilis sporulation phospho-relay (27Burbulys D. Trach K.A. Hoch J.A. Cell. 1991; 64: 545-552Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar), and between the ArcA and ArcB proteins of the E. coli anoxic redox control phospho-relay (28Georgellis D. Kwon O. De Wulf P. Lin E.C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32864-32869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). To demonstrate phospho-transfer from RdeA to RegA receiver domain, a method for direct RdeA phosphorylation was required. For this, a heterologous system employing the bacterial chemotaxis protein CheA was devised. In vitro, the isolated catalytic domain of CheA phosphorylated RdeA (Fig. 3 A). The phosphate present on RdeA was resistant to alkali but entirely removed by acid treatment (results not shown), suggesting a phosphoramidate linkage, such as phospho-histidine. Furthermore, phosphorylation of RdeA required His65 (Fig. 3 A), implying that this is the site of phosphorylation. When RegA receiver domain was added to [32P]RdeA, label was transferred to the wild type but not D212N receiver domain (Fig. 3 B); in the presence of D212N receiver domain, phospho-RdeA was stable over the time course of the experiment (estimated t 12 > 6 h). Wild type receiver domain rapidly removed the 32P label from phospho-RdeA, but labeling of the receiver itself was transient. This is likely due in part to the instability of aspartyl-phosphate but also to intrinsic phosphatase activity of the receiver. The half-life of phospho-RdeA in the presence of 10 μm WT receiver domain was approximately 5 min. Because phospho-transfer from a cognate H-domain protein to RegA receiver domain is predicted to activate the phosphodiesterase, the ability of phospho-RdeA to activate RegA in vitro was investigated. However, activation could not be demonstrated using CheA catalytic domain to phosphorylate RdeA, because of the inefficiency of this reaction. Nevertheless, the principle could be demonstrated using a heterologous phospho-donor protein. For this, the H-domain (i.e. the P1-domain) of CheA, which is the normal substrate of the CheA catalytic domain, was used as phospho-donor for RegA. Phospho-H-domain, phosphorylated using CheA catalytic domain and [γ-32P]ATP (as for RdeA above), was rapidly dephosphorylated by RegA receiver domain (t 12 of phospho-H-domain was ∼3 min in the presence of 10 μmreceiver domain) (results not shown), which concomitantly acquired this phosphate. As with transfer from RdeA to the RegA receiver domain, phospho-transfer from CheA H-domain required Asp212 of the RegA receiver domain (not shown). To investigate the activation of RegA, a coupled assay was employed. A standard phosphodiesterase reaction was supplemented with (unphosphorylated) CheA H-domain and ATP. A PDE assay was initiated by addition of RegA (either wild type or D212N), and the rate of cAMP hydrolysis was monitored under these conditions, prior to the addition of CheA catalytic domain. CheA catalytic domain was then added, and its effect on PDE activity was determined. Fig. 4 A shows that CheA catalytic domain stimulated PDE activity only in the reaction containing wild type RegA together with CheA H-domain and ATP. All other reactions, lacking any one of these components or containing D212N RegA instead of wild type RegA, showed no stimulation. Thus, there was no direct effect of CheA catalytic domain on RegA activity, but rather activation was via phospho-transfer from phosphorylated H-domain (Fig. 4 B). Furthermore, because D212N RegA showed no response, activation required Asp212. To analyze the dose-response relationship of RegA activation by phospho-H-domain, a modified version of the coupled assay was used. Fig. 4 A shows that there is a lag phase after addition of CheA catalytic domain before RegA is significantly activated. This represents the period during which phospho-H-domain must accumulate to sufficient concentrations to activate RegA. To avoid this lag phase, unphosphorylated CheA H-domain (at various concentrations) was preincubated with CheA catalytic domain and ATP. The amount of phospho-H-domain produced was determined from identical parallel reactions that also contained [γ-32P]ATP. RegA was added directly to the above reactions, containing known amounts of phospho-H-domain, and PDE activity was determined. Fig.5 shows the dose-response curve for RegA activation by phospho-H-domain; activation required a threshold phospho-H concentration of about 1 μm, and maximal activation occurred at about 50 μm. At saturation, RegA was activated at least 20-fold by phospho-transfer from CheA H-domain. Previous in vitro studies suggested that the phosphorylated form of RegA is the more active species. We have shown that this is also the casein vivo, in that a nonphosphorylatable version of RegA fails to restore wild type development to a regA nullDictyostelium strain and therefore is much less active than wild type RegA in the cell. A possible connection between RdeA and RegA was suggested on genetic grounds (9Thomason P.A. Traynor D. Cavet G. Chang W.-T. Harwood A.J. Kay R.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2838-2845Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 21Chang W.T. Thomason P.A. Gross J.D. Newell P.C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2809-2816Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The phospho-transfer experiments presented under “Results” provide direct evidence for biochemical communication between RdeA and RegA. Importantly, all of the phospho-transfer activities between RdeA and RegA require both His65 of RdeA and Asp212 of RegA; both of these are essential residuesin vivo. It seems very likely that RdeA functions upstream of RegA on a phospho-relay pathway to control cAMP levels. The proposed phospho-relay pathway is shown in Fig. 6(after Refs. 9Thomason P.A. Traynor D. Cavet G. Chang W.-T. Harwood A.J. Kay R.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2838-2845Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar and 21Chang W.T. Thomason P.A. Gross J.D. Newell P.C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2809-2816Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). As outlined above, rdeA andregA null mutants share many characteristics, both having rapid development, premature spore maturation, and a common biochemical defect, i.e. elevated cAMP. However, the rdeAnull phenotype appears more severe, suggesting that RdeA may supply phosphate to other response regulators. The loss of regulation of such putative response regulators in an rdeA mutant could contribute to the severity of the rdeA null phenotype. In devising a method for RdeA phosphorylation, we showed that RdeA behaves as an H-domain protein in vitro, in that it acts as a substrate for CheA catalytic domain. This supports previous in vivo evidence showing that an rdeA null mutant can be complemented by the yeast H-domain-encoding gene, YPD1 (21Chang W.T. Thomason P.A. Gross J.D. Newell P.C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2809-2816Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Interestingly, a different method has recently been used to phosphorylate Ypd1 itself in vitro, that of phospho-transfer from phospho-CheY (29Janiak-Spens F. Sparling J.M. Gurfinkel M. West A.H. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 411-417Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). CheY is a cognate response regulator (i.e. downstream target) of CheA; phosphorylation of Ypd1 by CheA catalytic domain has not been tested, but our results with RdeA suggest that this method would also work. Thus, the known eukaryotic H-domain protein, Ypd1 and the proposed H-domain protein RdeA will directly couple to proteins of the bacterial CheA-CheY systemin vitro. It may be possible to use the CheA-CheY network to help study further eukaryotic response regulator and H-domain proteins when they are discovered. Phosphorylated CheA H-domain, for example, may activate other response regulators as it does RegA. As with all enzymes whose activity is regulated by phosphorylation, RegA activity in vivo must reflect the relative levels of kinase and phosphatase activities directed toward RegA. One factor regulating phospho-RegA levels may be intrinsic aspartate phosphatase activity, as mentioned above, but there are likely other factors too. Bacteria possess specific aspartate phosphatases (e.g. RapA/B and Spo0E in B. subtilis) (30Perego M. Hoch J.A. Trends Genet. 1996; 12: 97-101Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) and phosphatase-activating proteins (e.g. CheZ) (31Bourret R.B. Borkovich K.A. Simon M.I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 401-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). However, little is known about the dephosphorylation of aspartyl-phosphate in eukaryotes and homologs of the above genes have not been found so far. Because we have shown that phosphate can be transferred either forward, from RdeA to RegA, or backward, from RegA to RdeA, depending on the relative concentrations of the phospho-donor proteins, reverse phospho-relay could contribute to control of RegA activity. Such a mechanism is thought to occur in the regulation of the ArcB-ArcA system in E. coli (28Georgellis D. Kwon O. De Wulf P. Lin E.C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32864-32869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), under conditions where the receiver domain of the hybrid kinase ArcB exhibits aspartate phosphatase activity. The balance of opposing kinase/phosphatase activities of HPK enzymes represents an important regulatory area in phospho-relay networks. RegA controls many aspects of Dictyostelium development. regA null mutants begin development earlier, aggregate faster, do not undertake developmental arrest at the slug stage, and display precocious terminal differentiation compared with wild type strains. Potentially, RegA activity is controlled at all of these stages. The kinases that input phosphate to the RegA pathway (or extract phosphate by reverse phospho-relay) are not yet defined. Several genes encoding putative hybrid histidine kinases have been cloned fromDictyostelium (32Schuster S.C. Noegel A.A. Oehme F. Gerisch G. Simon M.I. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3880-3889Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 33Wang N. Shaulsky G. Escalante R. Loomis W.F. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3890-3898Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 34Zinda M.J. Singleton C.K. Dev. Biol. 1998; 196: 171-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 35Singleton C.K. Zinda M.J. Mykytka B. Yang P. Dev. Biol. 1998; 203: 345-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and further candidates also exist (36Thomason P. Traynor D. Kay R. Trends Genet. 1999; 15: 15-19Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Mutations in genes encoding upstream kinases that activate RegA should resemble the regA null. None of the mutants in the four characterized genes have this phenotype, but this may be due to some degree of functional overlap. However, because individual null mutants in these four genes all have distinct developmental phenotypes, there must be significant genetic specificity among the kinases. Of the four putative histidine kinases, DhkC seems to be the clearest candidate activator of the RegA pathway, because the dhkCnull strain shows aspects of rapid development (35Singleton C.K. Zinda M.J. Mykytka B. Yang P. Dev. Biol. 1998; 203: 345-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). For DhkA and DhkB, genetic evidence suggests that they may be inhibitors of the RegA pathway (33Wang N. Shaulsky G. Escalante R. Loomis W.F. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3890-3898Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 34Zinda M.J. Singleton C.K. Dev. Biol. 1998; 196: 171-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). One way in which they could do this is by regulating the stability of phospho-RegA, perhaps by a mechanism such as those discussed above. Finally, DokA may also have a role in cAMP signaling during late development, because a dokA null mutant fails to make mature spores during culmination (32Schuster S.C. Noegel A.A. Oehme F. Gerisch G. Simon M.I. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3880-3889Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) and thus may have defects in PKA activation. Multiple histidine kinases in Dictyostelium, with the potential to act as receptors, may control RegA (and thus cAMP) signaling in response to multiple extracellular ligands, many of which may remain to be discovered. Candidate ligands so far include ammonia, the proposed ligand for DhkC (35Singleton C.K. Zinda M.J. Mykytka B. Yang P. Dev. Biol. 1998; 203: 345-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), the spore germination inhibitor discadenine (a proposed ligand for DhkB (34Zinda M.J. Singleton C.K. Dev. Biol. 1998; 196: 171-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar)), and the spore differentiation factors. Spore differentiation factor-2 has been proposed to signal via DhkA to inhibit the RegA pathway (37Anjard C. Zeng C. Loomis W.F. Nellen W. Dev. Biol. 1998; 193: 146-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Whichever ligands and receptors do contribute to RegA control, their inputs must be integrated to produce an appropriate output, in terms of PKA activity, to co-ordinate development.

R., Chessler, S. D., Golub, S. B., Byers, P. H., Chan, D., Cole, W. G., Sillence, D. O. and Bateman, J. F. (1995)J. Biol. Chem. 270, 8642–8649). To further explore the degradation of procollagen chains with mutant C-propeptides, mouse Mov13 cells, which produce no endogenous pro-α1(I), were stably transfected with a pro-α1(I) expression construct containing a frameshift mutation that predicts the synthesis of a protein 85 residues longer than normal. Despite high levels of mutant mRNA in transfected Mov13 cells, only minute amounts of mutant pro-α1(I) could be detected indicating that the majority of the mutant pro-α1(I) chains synthesized are targeted for rapid intracellular degradation. Degradation was not prevented by brefeldin A, monensin, or NH4Cl, agents that interfere with intracellular transport or lysosomal function. However, mutant pro-α1(I) chains in both transfected Mov13 cells and OI26 cells were protected from proteolysis by specific proteasome inhibitors. Together these data demonstrate for the first time that procollagen chains containing C-propeptide mutations that impair assembly are degraded by the cytoplasmic proteasome complex, and that the previously identified endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation of mutant pro-α1(I) in OI26 is mediated by proteasomes. We have previously shown that type I procollagen pro-α1(I) chains from an osteogenesis imperfecta patient (OI26) with a frameshift mutation resulting in a truncated C-propeptide, have impaired assembly, and are degraded by an endoplasmic reticulum-associated pathway (Lamandé, S.

Hulmes D.J.S. Ruggeri A. Motta P.M. Ultrastructure of the Connective Tissue Matrix. Martinus Nijhoff Publishers, Boston1984: 1-33Crossref Google Scholar). They are synthesized as precursor molecules with a central triple-helical region containing a Gly-X-Y amino acid repeat motif, flanked by carboxyl- and amino-terminal propeptide globular domains (for review, see Ref. 2Kielty C.M. Hopkinson I. Grant M.E. Royce P.M. Steinmann B. Connective Tissue and Its Heritable Disorders: Molecular, Genetic, and Medical Aspects. Wiley-Liss, Inc., New York1993: 103-147Google Scholar). Assembly of three individual pro-α-chains to form a triple helix occurs within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER),1 and is initiated by interactions between the C-propeptides. Triple helix folding then occurs sequentially from the COOH to the NH2 terminus, and is essential for efficient secretion of the procollagen molecules (3Bachinger H.P. Bruckner P. Timpl R. Prockop D.J. Engel J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 106: 619-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Mutations in the pro-α1(I) and pro-α2(I) chains of type I collagen which compromise initial chain association or disturb the folding of the triple helix result in the brittle bone disease osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) (4Lamande S.R.

J. 1984; 217: 103-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) and one of the important biosynthetic consequences of these mutations is an increase in intracellular collagen degradation (7Bateman J.F. Mascara T. Chan D. Cole W.G. Biochem. J. 1984; 217: 103-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Intracellular degradation is an essential process for regulating the levels of many proteins and an important “quality control” mechanism which minimizes the accumulation within cells and the secretion of mutant or malfolded proteins. Several cellular compartments have been identified as sites for degradation, including the lysosomes which contain acid hydrolases, a post-Golgi non-lysosomal compartment, the ER, and the cytoplasm where the 26 S proteasome, a large catalytic protease complex, is responsible for the degradation (8Bienkowski R.S. Biochem. J. 1983; 214: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 9Jentsch S. Schlenker S. Cell. 1995; 82: 881-884Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). While the molecular basis of intracellular collagen degradation has not been fully defined, three of these four cellular compartments have been implicated as the site of collagen proteolysis. In fibroblasts, approximately 15% of normal procollagen is degraded intracellularly by a process that has been termed basal degradation (10Bienkowski R.S. Baum B.J. Crystal R.G. Nature. 1978; 276: 413-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 11Bienkowski R.S. Cowan M.J. McDonald J.A. Crystal R.G. J. Biol.

Chem. 1993; 268: 3677-3682Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a drug which causes the cis- and medial-Golgi to fuse with the ER and prevents further intracellular transport. These results suggest that degradation occurs in the distal region of the secretory pathway after the brefeldin A block, in regions that are susceptible to NH4Cl inhibition such as the trans-Golgi and secretory vesicles or in the lysosomes. Recent studies have demonstrated directly the localization of procollagen I in the lysosome/endosome system (16Ripley C.R. Bienkowski R.S. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 236: 147-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) identifying this system as a site of collagen degradation, however, normal procollagen degradation in I-cell disease (Mucolipidosis II) fibroblasts, which are deficient in lysosomal hydrolases, suggests that trans-Golgi and secretory vesicles also represent sites of procollagen degradation (17Bienkowski R.S. Ripley C.R. Gitzelmann R. Steinmann B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 168: 479-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Not all mutant collagen is degraded in the distal region of the secretory pathway. Procollagens with mutations in the pro-α1(I) C-propeptide which compromise chain association are degraded by a process which is not prevented by brefeldin A, and was therefore assumed to occur within the ER (4Lamande S.R.

This process requires reverse transport of protein back to the cytoplasm, a process which may be mediated by interaction of the protein with the Sec61 complex, one of the major constituents of the translocation apparatus (22Wiertz E.J.H.J.

Nature. 1997; 388: 891-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). In this study we explore the role of proteasomes in the ER-associated degradation of assembly impaired mutant type I procollagen. We examined two pro-α1(I) C-propeptide OI mutations. The first mutation, an engineered frameshift mutation near the COOH-terminal end of the mouse pro-α1(I) chain, was analagous to a mutation defined in a patient with OI type I (25Willing M.C. Cohn D.H. Byers P.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 85: 282-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Fibroblasts from that patient contained both mutant and normal pro-α1(I) mRNA, but mutant protein could not be detected in cells suggesting that it was rapidly and completely degraded prior to assembly (25Willing M.C. Cohn D.H. Byers P.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 85: 282-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In addition, we examine fibroblasts from a patient (OI26) in which a heterozygous frameshift mutation impaired, but did not prevent subunit assembly (4Lamande S.R. Chessler S.D. Golub S.B. Byers P.H. Chan D. Cole W.G. Sillence D.O. Bateman J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8642-8649Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). In both cases the use of specific proteasome inhibitors demonstrated a primary role for cytoplasmic proteasomes in the selective degradation of procollagen chains with mutations within the C-propeptide. Dermal fibroblast cultures from controls and a patient with the lethal perinatal form of OI (OI26) were established and maintained in culture as described previously (7Bateman J.F. Mascara T. Chan D. Cole W.G. Biochem. J. 1984; 217: 103-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The molecular defect in OI26 is a heterozygous single base insertion in the final exon of COL1A1 (6Bateman J.F. Lamande S.R. Dahl H.H. Chan D. Mascara T. Cole W.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10960-10964Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The codon reading frameshift generated by the mutation alters the amino acid sequence of the pro-α1(I) C-propeptide and results in a chain which is 37 amino acids shorter than normal (Fig. 1 B). Mouse Mov13 cells (26Schnieke A. Harbers K. Jaenisch R. Nature. 1983; 304: 315-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar) were provided by Dr. R. Jaenisch (Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research, Cambridge, MA). Mov13 cells synthesize no endogenous pro-α1(I) chains since the transcription of both COL1A1 genes is blocked by a retroviral insertion in the first intron (26Schnieke A. Harbers K. Jaenisch R.

A clone was isolated that contained a 2-bp deletion within aClaI site 69 bases upstream of the translation stop signal (data not shown). This deletion created a codon reading frameshift which would direct the synthesis of a pro-α1(I) chain 85 residues longer than normal with an anomalous sequence covering the COOH-terminal 109 amino acids (Fig. 1 A). The final reassembled 25-kilobase COL1A1 gene construct was named pWTCI-IAfs to indicate the amino acid substitutions in the protein product (the triple helical Met822 → Ile substitution, a silent C-propeptide Met1199-Ala alteration, and the 2-bp deletion creating a codon reading frameshift). This frameshift mutation is similar to one characterized in a patient with type I OI, where a 5-bp deletion predicted a pro-α1(I) chain extended by 84 amino acids (25Willing M.C. Cohn D.H. Byers P.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 85: 282-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The mouse gene, pWTCI-IAfs, was stably transfected into Mov13 cells along with pSV2neo. Neomycin-resistant transfected cells were selected in G418 (Life Technologies Inc.), and individual colonies isolated and expanded into cell lines as described previously (28Lamande S.R. Bateman J.F.

J. 1985; 228: 425-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). RNA samples (3 μg) were analyzed under denaturing conditions on 0.8% (w/v) agarose gels and transferred to nitrocellulose filters. Filters were pretreated at 42 oC with 50% (v/v) formamide, 5 × SSC (750 mm NaCl, 75 mm trisodium citrate), 0.02% (w/v) Ficoll, 0.02% (w/v) polyvinylpyrrolidone, 0.02% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, 0.1% SDS, and 100 μg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA. Filters were then hybridized to [α-32P]dCTP-labeled mouse α1(I) and rat glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (31Piechaczyk M. Blanchard J.M. Marty L. Dani C. Panabieres F. El Sabouty S. Fort P. Jeanteur P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 6951-6963Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar)) cDNA probes for 16 h at 42 oC then washed in 0.1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at 65oC and exposed to x-ray film at −70 oC. Confluent cell cultures were labeled with [3H]proline for 18 h as described previously (7Bateman J.F. Mascara T. Chan D. Cole W.G. Biochem. J. 1984; 217: 103-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Following labeling the cell layer and medium fractions were treated separately (7Bateman J.F. Mascara T. Chan D. Cole W.G. Biochem. J. 1984; 217: 103-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 32Bateman J.F. Chan D. Mascara T. Rogers J.G. Cole W.G. Biochem. J. 1986; 240: 699-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Briefly, after disruption of the cell layer by sonication, procollagens and collagens were precipitated from the cell and medium fractions with ammonium sulfate at 25% saturation. The precipitate was redissolved in 2 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 0.15 m NaCl and the protease inhibitors 5 mm EDTA, 10 mm N-ethylmaleimide, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Aliquots of procollagens were precipitated with 75% ethanol and either analyzed directly or subjected to limited pepsin digestion (100 μg/ml pepsin in 0.5 m acetic acid, 4 oC, 16 h) to determine if the collagens had formed pepsin-resistant triple helices. For the pulse-chase analysis of procollagen degradation, skin fibroblasts and transfected Mov13 cells in 6-well plates were grown to confluence and treated with 0.25 mm sodium ascorbate overnight. The cells were preincubated in 1 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without l-methionine andl-cysteine (Life Technologies Inc.) for 1 h then pulse-labeled for 1 h with 300 μCi ofl-[35S]methionine (Tran35S-label, 1032 Ci/mmol, ICN Pharmaceuticals Inc.). Cells were treated with the proteasome inhibitors: carboxylbenzyl-leucinyl-leucinyl-leucinal (ZL3al) (Sigma), carboxybenzyl-leucyl-leucyl-leucine-vinylsulfone (ZL3VS) (kindly provided by H. Ploegh, MIT, Boston, MA (33Bogyo M. Mc Master J.S. Gaczynska M. Tortorella D. Goldberg A.L. Ploegh H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cells were washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, scraped into 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline, and centrifuged briefly to pellet cells. Cells were lysed in 0.5 ml of lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 5 mm EDTA, 20 mm N-ethylmaleimide, 1 mm4-(2aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride, 2 mmiodoacetamide, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40) on ice for 30 min. Lysed cells were centrifuged for 5 min at 10,000 × g to remove insoluble material and the supernatant precleared with 100 μl of 20% Protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at 4 oC for 2 h. Type I procollagen pro-α1(I) chains in the supernatant were immunoprecipitated with LF-67 (1/1000 dilution), a rabbit polyclonal antibody which recognizes the pro-α1(I) carboxyl-terminal telopeptide of both human and mouse proteins (34Fisher L.W. Lindner W. Young M.F. Termine J.D. Connect. Tissue Res. 1989; 21: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) (kindly provided by Dr. Larry Fisher, National Institute of Dental Research, Bethesda, MD), and 100 μl of 20% Protein A-Sepharose at 4 oC overnight. Immunoprecipitated complexes were washed twice for 30 min each with 50% (v/v) lysis buffer, 50% (v/v) NET buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40), twice with NET buffer, then once with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 0.1% Nonidet P-40. Immunoprecipitated chains were eluted into electrophoresis loading buffer at 65 oC for 10 min. Type I procollagen and collagen chains were analyzed by SDS-PAGE on 5% (w/v) polyacrylamide gels. Where indicated, samples were reduced before electrophoresis by the addition of dithiothreitol to a final concentration of 10 mm. Procollagen chains were also analyzed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (35Cole W.G. Chan D. Biochem. J. 1981; 197: 377-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) which resolves the chains on the basis of both charge and size. Radioactively labeled proteins were detected by fluorography. For immunoblotting, procollagen chains resolved by SDS-PAGE were electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose filters. Blots were incubated with LF-67 at a dilution of 1/10,000 and bound antibody detected using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated Protein A (Bio-Rad) and an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Mov13 cells are a unique model system in which to study intracellular collagen degradation. Expression of mutant COL1A1 genes in these cells allows the fate of the resultant mutant pro-α1(I) chains to be easily followed without the complications of endogenous pro-α1(I) expression (28Lamande S.R. Bateman J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17858-17865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 29Lamande S.R. Bateman J.F. Biochem. J. 1993; 293: 387-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The mutant mouse COL1A1 frameshift construct, pWTCI-IAfs (Fig.1), contains a mutation which is similar to one characterized in a patient with type I OI, where a 5-bp deletion predicted a pro-α1(I) chain extended by 84 amino acids (25Willing M.C. Cohn D.H. Byers P.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 85: 282-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). While mutant mRNA was present within the OI cells and could be translated in an in vitro translation system, the protein was not detected in cell culture suggesting that the aberrant protein was rapidly degraded intracellularly. The predicted human and mouse proteins show extensive sequence homology, including a highly positively charged COOH terminus, and might be expected to share similar metabolic fates. To examine the biochemical consequences of the mouse frameshift mutation and address the question of procollagen subunit stability and the targeting of abnormal chains for intracellular degradation raised by the human type I OI mutation, Mov13 cells were transfected with the mutant construct, pWTCI-IAfs. Individual, stably transfected clones were selected in medium containing G418 then screened for expression of pro-α1(I) mRNA by Northern blot analysis. In contrast to the untransfected Mov13 cells which produced no pro-α1(I) mRNA (Fig.2, lane 1), high levels of pro-α1(I) mRNA of the correct size were apparent in two transfected cell lines, Mov13-IAfs4 and Mov13-IAfs10 (Fig. 2,lanes 5 and 6), and a third cell line, Mov13-IAfs2, contained low levels of pro-α1(I) mRNA (Fig. 2,lane 4). To examine the ability of the frameshift mutant pro-α1(I) mRNA to be translated and the mutant pro-α1(I) chains to assemble into functional collagen molecules, stably transfected cells were biosynthetically labeled with [3H]proline for 18 h and cell and medium fractions analyzed by SDS-PAGE after digestion with pepsin. Pepsin removes the NH2- and COOH-terminal globular domains but leaves the triple helical domain intact. Thus the presence of pepsin-resistant collagen indicates that stable collagen trimeric assembly has occurred. In untransfected Mov cells no pepsin-resistent collagen was present (Fig. 3, lanes 1 and2) and in cells transfected with the wild-type collagen gene, high levels of pepsin-resistant collagen were present (Fig. 3,lanes 3 and 4). In cells expressing mutant mRNA, only minute amounts of pepsin-resistant triple-helical collagen were present (Fig. 3, lanes 7–12). While these data indicate that the mutant procollagen is not able to assemble to form significant amounts of stable collagen trimer, it was important to demonstrate that this small amount of collagen trimer was derived from the transfected mutant gene and not from low-level transcription of the endogenous inactivated COL1A1. The mutant frameshift construct, pWTCI-IAfs, also carried the silent reporter Met822-Ile amino acid change within the helix. This marker allows normal and transfected mutant α1(I) chains to be distinguished because it deletes a cyanogen bromide cleavage site in the protein (28Lamande S.R. Bateman J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17858-17865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar,29Lamande S.R. Bateman J.F. Biochem. J. 1993; 293: 387-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The presence of the larger distinctive peptide in CNBr-digested pepsin-resistant collagen produced by cells transfected with the frameshift construct confirmed that the α1(I) chains were synthesized from the mutant gene and were not the result of low-level transcription of the inactivated endogenous COL1A1 in these clonal Mov13 cell lines (data not shown). From these results we conclude that although the mutant mRNA is transcribed at levels at least as high as that of the control COL1A1 transfectants which produce abundant collagen heterotrimers, only a very small proportion of the mutant pro-α1(I) chains can associate with endogenous pro-α2(I) and form triple-helical molecules which can be secreted from the cell. Despite the accumulation of small amounts of type I collagen in these cultures over the 18-h labeling period, intracellular precursor pro-α1(I) chains could not be detected by proline radiolabeling and fluorography (data not shown). This failure to detect intracellular frameshift mutant pro-α1(I) chains using standard radiolabeling procedures indicated that degradation was rapid, almost complete, and the unassembled subunits did not accumulate within the cells. A more sensitive method of protein detection was thus required to allow the fate of the mutant protein to be investigated further. Cell layer proteins produced by untransfected Mov13 cells, and cells transfected with wild-type and mutant COL1A1 genes, were separated by SDS-PAGE, electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose, and the filter probed with antibody LF-67. Mov13-IAfs10 cells synthesized a pro-α1(I) subunit that migrated more slowly than control pro-α1(I) (Fig. 4, lane 3). This was consistent with the prediction that the mutant protein would be 85 amino acids larger than normal and may be substituted with an additional N-linked oligosaccharide group. The mutant pro-α1(I) subunits migrated as monomers when analyzed without reduction (Fig. 4, lane 5), indicating that interchain disulfide bonds had not formed and suggesting that trimer assembly is severely impaired. To determine the site of intracellular degradation, Mov13-IAfs10 cells were treated with several protease and vesicular traffic inhibitors and the relative levels of mutant protein compared. Cells were pretreated for 1 h with inhibitors, metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine for 2 h, chased for 30 min in the presence of inhibitor, and the intracellular pro-α1(I) chains immunoprecipitated with LF-67. In these untreated cells, mutant pro-α1(I) was not detected, indicating that complete degradation of the mutant protein produced during the 2-h pulse had occurred within the 30-min chase period (Fig.5 A, lane 1). The mutant subunit was also not detected in cells treated with brefeldin A, which blocks protein transport into the Golgi and results in redistribution of most of the Golgi into the ER (36Lippincott-Schwartz J. Yuan L.C. Bonifacino J.S. Klausner R.D. Cell. 1989; 56: 801-813Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1310) Google Scholar), monensin, a carboxylic ionophore which blocks intracellular traffic within the trans-Golgi, or NH4Cl, which raises the pH of acidic compartments such as the trans-Golgi and lysosomes (Fig. 5 A, lanes 2–4). Since these agents inhibit intracellular vesicular traffic, or inhibit lysosomal function, degradation of the mutant frameshift pro-α1(I) does not occur in the distal regions of the secretory pathway. This suggests that, as in lethal OI patients with C-propeptide mutations (4Lamande S.R. Chessler S.D. Golub S.B. Byers P.H. Chan D. Cole W.G. Sillence D.O. Bateman J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8642-8649Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), the degradation pathway may be “ER-mediated.” Recently, it has become apparent that a number of mutant proteins which have been targeted to the ER and were thought to be degraded within that compartment are, in fact, degraded in the cytoplasm by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (18Laing J.G.

Here we showed in in vitroexperiments that gelsolin inhibited recombinant phospholipase D1 (PLD1) and PLD2 activities but not the oleate-dependent PLD and that this inhibition was not reversed by increasing PIP2concentration. To investigate the role of gelsolin in agonist-mediated PLD activation, we used NIH 3T3 fibroblasts stably transfected with the cDNA for human cytosolic gelsolin. Gelsolin overexpression suppressed bradykinin-induced activation of phospholipase C (PLC) and PLD. On the other hand, sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P)-induced PLD activation could not be modified by gelsolin overexpression, whereas PLC activation was suppressed. PLD activation by phorbol myristate acetate or Ca2+ ionophore A23187 was not affected by gelsolin overexpression. Stimulation of control cells with either bradykinin or S1P caused translocation of protein kinase C (PKC) to the membranes. Translocation of PKC-α and PKC-β1 but not PKC-ε was reduced in gelsolin-overexpressed cells, whereas phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase was not changed. S1P-induced PLC activation and mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphorylation were sensitive to pertussis toxin, but PLD response was insensitive to such treatment, suggesting that S1P induced PLD activation via certain G protein distinct from Gi for PLC and mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway.

In the present study, to determine whether gelsolin regulates PLD activity via binding to PIP2 in vivo, we examined bradykinin- and S1P-induced PLD activation in NIH 3T3 cells overexpressing gelsolin. Phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), PC, PIP2, sodium oleate, geneticin (G418), A23187, and phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) were purchased from Sigma. Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) was from Matreya, Inc.

NIH 3T3 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) with 4 mml-glutamate supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 100 units of penicillin/ml, and 100 μg of streptomycin/ml at 37 °C in a humidified, CO2-controlled (5%) incubator. A HindIII-StuI fragment of human cytoplasmic gelsolin cDNA (21Cunningham C.C. Stossel T.P. Kwiatkowski D.J. Science. 1991; 251: 1233-1236Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar) was cloned intoHindIII-HpaI site of pLNCX retroviral vector (a generous gift from Dr. A. D. Miller, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center) (22Miller A.D. Rosman G.J. Biotechniques. 1989; 7: 980-986PubMed Google Scholar). The resulting construct, pLNChGsn or pLNCX alone was transfected into Bosc 23, a highly efficient ecotropic virus-packaging cell line (23Pear S.W. Nolan G.P. Scott M.L. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8392-8396Crossref PubMed Scopus (2306) Google Scholar), using LipofectAMINE. Two days after lipofection, the virus-containing supernatant was collected and centrifuged to remove cells and debris. NIH 3T3 cells were infected with the virus-containing supernatant. The vector and gelsolin-transfected cells were maintained in the presence of 0.5 mg/ml G418. The expression of gelsolin or PLD proteins was examined by Western blotting with specific antibodies using the ECL detection system. PLD1 and PLD2 were overexpressed in Sf9 cells that had been infected with recombinant baculoviruses harboring human PLD1 or PLD2 cDNAs (kindly supplied by Dr. M. A. Frohman, State University of New York) as described previously (11Hammond S.M. Altshuller Y.M. Sung T.C. Rudge S.A. Rose K. Engebrecht J. Morris A.J. Frohman M.A. J. Biol.

Cells were suspended in ice-cold lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml (l-3-trans-carboxyoxirane-2-carbonyl)-l-leucyl-agmatine, E-64) and lysed by sonication. The lysates were centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 5 min, and the resulting supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min to obtain the membrane fraction. PLD1 activity was assayed essentially as described previously (20Mssenburg D. Han J.S. Liyanage M.P. Patton W.A. Rhee S.G. Moss J. Vaughan M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11717-11722Google Scholar) by measuring the generation of 3H-labeled choline from [choline-methyl-3H]dipalmitoyl-PC. Briefly, 20 μl of lipid vesicles containing PE, PIP2, and PC in a molar ratio of 16:1.4:1 with [choline-methyl-3H]dipalmitoyl-PC (total 4 × 105 cpm/assay) were added to 100 μl of a mixture containing PLD source, 10 μm ARF, 5 μm GTPγS, 50 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.5, 3 mm EGTA, 80 mm KCl, 2.5 mmMgCl2, and 2 mm CaCl2. PLD2 activity was assayed using the procedure used for PLD1 except for omitting PLD1, ARF, and GTPγS. Oleate-dependent PLD activity was assayed by measuring the generation of3H-labeled choline from [choline-methyl-3H]dipalmitoyl-PC in the presence of 0.5 mm oleate (20Mssenburg D. Han J.S. Liyanage M.P. Patton W.A. Rhee S.G. Moss J. Vaughan M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11717-11722Google Scholar). NIH 3T3 cells in 6-well plates were prelabeled with 1 μCi/mlmyo-[3H]inositol for 24 h in inositol-free DMEM medium containing 0.3% bovine serum albumin (BSA). Cells were then washed twice with the HEPES/Tyrode buffer (10 mm HEPES/NaOH, pH 7.4, 134 mm NaCl, 12 mm NaHCO3, 2.9 mm KCl, 0.36 mm NaH2PO4, 1.0 mmMgCl2, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 1 mg/ml BSA, and 1 mg/ml glucose) containing 20 mm LiCl and further incubated for 15 min at 37 °C before stimulation with agonists. Cells were then stimulated with agonists for the indicated time intervals, and the reactions were terminated by the addition of ice-cold 10% perchloric acid. Inositol phosphates were separated using AG 1 × 8 anion exchange resin (formate form, 200–400 mesh, Bio-Rad) as described by Berridge et al. (24Berridge M.J. Dawson R.M.C. Downes P. Heslop J.P. Irvine R.F. Biochem. J. 1983; 212: 473-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (1541) Google Scholar). Subconfluent cells were labeled overnight with 1 μCi/ml [3H]palmitic acid in DMEM containing 0.3% BSA. Cells were washed and preincubated in HEPES-Tyrode buffer containing 0.3% 1-butanol (v/v) for 10 min. After stimulation of cells with agonists, the reactions were terminated by removing the assay buffer followed by immediate addition of 1 ml of an ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline/methanol (2:5, v/v) mixture to the culture dishes. Lipids were then extracted by the method of Bligh and Dyer (25Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (43132) Google Scholar) and separated on a Silica Gel 60 plate by one-dimensional thin-layer chromatography in a solvent system using an upper phase of ethyl acetate/2,24-trimethylpentane/acetic acid/water (13:2:3:10, v/v/v/v) as described previously (26Banno Y. Tamiya-Koizumi K. Oshima H. Morikawa A. Yoshida S. Nozawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5208-5213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The area corresponding to [3H]phosphatidylbutanol (PBut), identified by co-migration with PBut standard, was scraped off the plate, and radioactivity was determined in a liquid scintillation counter (Beckman LS-6500). Cells were grown in 100-mm dishes to near confluence and subjected to serum-free DMEM containing 0.3% BSA for 24 h. Washed cells were then stimulated with agonists, and harvested in ice-cold lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium cholate, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 50 mm NaCl, 25 mm HEPES, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml E-64, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm sodium fluoride, and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, pH 7.4), and then homogenized by sonication. Protein concentrations were assayed with Bradford protein assay reagent using BSA as the standard. Total cell lysates (20 μg) were subjected to electrophoresis on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The membranes were blocked with 5% BSA. Phosphorylation of MAP kinase 1/2 was determined by immunoblotting with a polyclonal antibody (anti-phospho-MAP kinase) that recognizes only activated MAP kinase 1/2. Total MAP kinase 1/2 was detected by blotting with an antibody against MAP kinases. After washing in 50 mmTris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 150 mm NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20, the membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibody. After repeated washings, the bound antibody was detected by using the ECL Western blotting detection system. For measurement of PKC translocation, NIH 3T3 cells were subjected to serum-free DMEM containing 0.3% BSA for 24 h before stimulation. The washed cells were stimulated and harvested in ice-cold buffer A (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, containing 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin) and then lysed by sonication. Cell lysates were centrifuged at 1,500 × g for 5 min, and the supernatants were further centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min. The pellets were resuspended in buffer A. For Western blot analysis, these membranes were separated on 8% gels by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. After blocking in 5% (w/v) BSA, the membranes were incubated with specific antibodies for PKC isozymes. The membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibody. After repeated washings, the bound antibody was detected by using the ECL Western blotting detection system. Since gelsolin is a potential actin-binding protein that has high affinity for PIP2 (15Janmey P.A. Stossel T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4825-4831Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Janmey P.A. Lamb J. Allen P.G. Matsudaira P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11818-11823Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we examined whether gelsolin inhibits PLD activity by binding the cofactor PIP2using Sf9 cells overexpressing PLD1 and PLD2. Gelsolin (5 μm) inhibited ARF-dependent PLD1 and PLD2 activities of membrane fractions from transfected Sf9 cells using PE-PIP2-PC micelles as substrate (Fig.1). On the other hand, gelsolin had no effect on oleate-dependent PLD activity abundant in PC12 cells. Further examination showed that PLD2 activity was inhibited by gelsolin in a concentration-dependent manner with maximum inhibition at 5 μm (Fig.2 A). On the other hand, PLD2 activity was stimulated by adding PIP2 to PE/PC vesicles in a concentration-dependent manner with a maximum at 40 μm in the absence of gelsolin (Fig. 2 B). The inhibitory effect of gelsolin (1 μm) was not abrogated by increasing PIP2 concentration, suggesting that gelsolin did not inhibit PLD2 activity by binding PIP2.Figure 2Concentration-dependent PLD2 inhibition by gelsolin and effects of PIP 2 on the inhibition. A, PLD2 activity was measured with various concentrations of gelsolin using PE/PIP2/[choline-methyl-3H]dipalmitoylPC as substrate as described under “Experimental Procedures.”B, the effects of PIP2 were examined without or with gelsolin (Gsl) (0.5 μm) at different concentrations of PIP2. Results are expressed as mean ± S.E. of duplicate determinations from three similar experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) -To examine the effect of gelsolin on PLD activation in vivo, we studied various clones stably overexpressing gelsolin in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts. Cells were transfected with a construct containing gelsolin cDNA, and two clones (G2 and G6) were obtained. The expression level of gelsolin was higher in G2 clone than G6 clone, as inferred by Western blot analysis (Fig. 3 A). A clone of vector-transfected NIH 3T3 cells (Vect) was used as control. No significant differences were observed in the growth rate and morphology between Vect, G2, and G6 cells (data not shown). To examine the expression levels of PLD isoforms in the transfected NIH3T3 cells, the lysates were subjected to Western blot analysis by using two PLD antibodies (Ab-224 and Ab-226). Both antibodies could react with recombinant human PLD1a, PLD1b, and mouse PLD2 used as standards. Ab-224 can detect PLD1a, PLD1b, and PLD2, and Ab-226 detected PLD1b and PLD2 but not PLD1a in HaCaT cell lysates (Fig. 3 B,upper panels, 1 and 2). Western blot analysis using these two antibodies revealed the presence of a significant amount of PLD2 and much less PLD1a (23% of PLD2) but not PLD1b in vector-transfected control NIH 3T3 cells (Vect) (Fig.3 B, lower panel). However, there were no significant differences in the amount of these PLD isoforms among Vect, G2, and G6 clones. Expression levels of other signaling enzymes, such as PKC isozymes (α, β1, δ1, and ε) and PLC isozymes (PLCβ1, β3, and γ1) were also not different between Vect- and gelsolin-overexpressing clones (data not shown). To examine the effects of gelsolin overexpression on PLD activation, formation of PBut was examined in Vect, G2, and G6 cells stimulated by bradykinin. The time course of PBut formation by bradykinin (2 μm)-stimulated Vect, G2, and G6 cells is shown in Fig. 4. Gelsolin overexpression reduced PBut formation induced by bradykinin stimulation. G2 clone with the highest level of gelsolin expression showed the lowest PBut formation compared with control (Vect) cells. PLD activation was reduced to a lesser extent in G6 clone, which had a lower gelsolin expression. These results suggest that inhibition of bradykinin-stimulated PBut formation appear to correlate with the expression level of gelsolin. PLD activation is known to be dependent on phosphoinositide hydrolysis by PLC, since PKC activation by diacylglycerol derived from PIP2 breakdown is involved in the activation of PLD by agonist stimulation (27Lee Y.H. Kim H.S. Pai J.K. Ryu S.H. Suh P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26842-26847Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Jones M.J. Murray A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5007-5013Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). We have previously demonstrated that gelsolin inhibited PLC activity in vitro (17Banno Y. Nakashima T. Kumada T. Ebisawa K. Nonomura Y. Nozawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6488-6494Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and Sun et al. (18Sun H. Lin K. Yin H.L. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 811-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) also demonstrate that gelsolin overexpression suppresses bradykinin-stimulated PLCβ activity. To examine the effect of gelsolin overexpression on PLC activation in NIH 3T3 cells, we measured the formation of inositol phosphates (InsPs) in response to bradykinin. As shown in Fig.5, bradykinin stimulation increased InsP formation in a concentration-dependent manner in control cells (Vect), whereas gelsolin overexpression reduced PLC response to bradykinin by approximately 50% in G2 cells (Fig. 5 A). Similar repression of PBut formation was observed in G2 cells stimulated with bradykinin at all concentrations tested (Fig.5 B). To examine whether inhibition of PLD activation by gelsolin overexpression is a downstream event in the PLC-PKC pathway, we examined the effect of Ca2+ ionophore, A23187, and PMA on PLD activation. PBut formation was increased by stimulation with 1 μm A23187 (Fig.6 A) or 100 nm PMA (Fig. 6 B) in a time-dependent manner. PBut formation induced by either stimulator was not affected by gelsolin overexpression. These observations suggested that bradykinin-mediated PLD activation was dependent upon PLC activation in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts. S1P is known to stimulate PLD activity in various cells (29Desai N.N. Zhang H. Olivera A. Mattie M.E. Spiegel S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23122-23128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Goodemote K.A. Mattie M.E. Berger A. Spiegel S. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 26318-26325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). To examine the effect of gelsolin on S1P signaling in NIH 3T3 cells, we investigated PLC and PLD activation by S1P in G2 cells. InsPs formation was increased by S1P stimulation in a concentration-dependent manner in control cells (Vect) but was reduced in G2 cells at the concentrations examined (Fig.7 A). PBut formation by S1P stimulation increased in a concentration-dependent manner in control cells, reaching a peak level with 5 μm S1P at 2 min. In sharp contrast to InsPs formation, S1P-stimulated PBut formation was not inhibited in G2 cells (Fig. 7 B). These results suggested that gelsolin overexpression repressed PLC activation but not PLD activation in S1P-stimulated cells. The bradykinin receptor has been known to couple to Gq (32Kiss Z. Crilly K.S. Anderson W.H. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 383-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), whereas the S1P receptor associates with a heterotrimeric G protein (EDG-1) (33Lee M-J. Van Brocklyn J.R. Thangada S. Liu C.H. Hand A.R. Menzeleev R. Spiegel S. Hla T. Science. 1998; 279: 1552-1555Crossref PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar, 34Zondag G.C.M. Postma F.R. Van Etten I. Verlaan I. Moolenaar W.H. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 605-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). A number of EDG receptor subfamilies are coupled to G proteins such as pertussis toxin (PTX)-sensitive Gi/Go or -insensitive Gq/G11, or G12/13proteins (35An S. Goetzl E.J. Lee H. J. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 30/31: 147-157Crossref Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 8, PTX pretreatment (200 ng/ml, for 24 h) of Vect and G2 cells markedly reduced InsP formation induced by S1P but not by bradykinin, suggesting that PLC activation by S1P may be mediated via PTX-sensitive G protein. On the other hand, PBut formation induced by S1P was not affected by pretreatment with PTX, even at a high concentration of PTX (2 μg/ml). These results suggest that the G protein involved in S1P-evoked PLD activation is distinct from that in PLC activation. PKC is one of the most potent stimulators of agonist-induced PLD activation (1Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15579-15582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). To study the involvement of PKC in the agonist-induced PLD activation, membrane fractions from bradykinin or S1P-stimulated Vect and G2 cells were examined by using antibodies to PKC isozymes. Treatment of Vect cells with bradykinin or S1P induced translocation of PKC-α, PKC-β1, and PKC-ε (Fig. 9). The addition of EGTA inhibited the translocation of PKC-α and PKC-β1 but not PKC-ε. Furthermore, S1P- but not bradykinin-induced translocation of PKC isozymes was suppressed by PTX treatment. PKC-α and PKC-β1 levels did not increase in membranes from G2 cells incubated with bradykinin or S1P. On the other hand, translocation of PKC-ε induced by both agonists was not affected in gelsolin overexpressing cells. Treatment of various cells with bradykinin or S1P resulted in activation of the MAP kinase pathway. Recently, Rizzoet al. (6Rizzo M.A. Shome K. Vasudevan C. Stolz D.B. Sung T.-C. Frohman M.A. Watkins S.C. Romero G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1131-1139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar) reported that PA formation via activation of PLD by insulin induced stimulation of the MAP kinase pathway via Raf-1 kinase activation. We examined the effect of gelsolin overexpression on the agonist-induced MAP kinase activation using an antibody that recognized the phosphorylated form of MAP kinase. Stimulation of Vect cells with S1P caused a marked phosphorylation of MAP kinase (Fig.10). PKC down-regulation by long term treatment with PMA (300 nm for 24 h) and PKC inhibitor Ro31–8220, but not tyrosine kinase inhibitor ST638, reduced S1P-induced MAP kinase phosphorylation by 80–90%. Pretreatment of Vect cells with PTX abolished S1P-induced MAP kinase phosphorylation, but EGTA had no effect. These results suggest that S1P-induced MAP kinase activation was PKC-dependent and PTX-sensitive. As shown in Fig. 10 C, MAP kinase phosphorylation induced by PMA, bradykinin, and S1P was similar in Vect and G2 cells, suggesting that gelsolin overexpression had no effect on agonist-stimulated MAP kinase activation. We showed in the present study that gelsolin inhibited recombinant PLD1 and PLD2 activities but not oleate-dependent PLD, which requires PIP2 as a cofactor in the exogenous substrate in vitro assay (1Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15579-15582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 2Exton J.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1436: 105-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). There are a number of inhibitory proteins for PLD activity such as synaptojanin and fodrin. These are not direct inhibitors of PLD activity but are related to reduced PIP2 in agonist-stimulated cells (36Chung J.-K. Sekiya F. Kang H-S. Lee C. Han J-S. Kim S.R. Bae Y.S. Morris A.J. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15980-15985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 37Lukowski S. Mira J.-P. Zachowski A. Geny B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 248: 278-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Ceramide also modulates agonist-mediated PLD activation by inhibiting PKC-α, ARF, or RhoA translocation (28Jones M.J. Murray A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5007-5013Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 38Abousalham A. Liossis C. O'Brien L. Brindley D.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1069-1075Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 39Nakamura Y. Nakashima S. Ojio K. Banno Y. Miyata H. Nozawa Y. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 256-262PubMed Google Scholar). Our previous study, however, indicated that C2-ceramide directly inhibited both GTPγS-dependent and -independent PLD activities in membrane fractions from HaCaT cells when assayed using the exogenous substrate PE/PIP2/PC (40Iwasaki-Bessho Y. Banno Y. Yoshimura S. Ito Y. Kitajima Y. Nozawa Y. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1998; 110: 376-382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This action of ceramide was probably due to competition with PIP2, since the inhibitory action of ceramide on PLD activity could be restored by increasing PIP2 (38Abousalham A. Liossis C. O'Brien L. Brindley D.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1069-1075Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Gelsolin is also known as a potential PIP2-binding protein and inhibits PLC activity by competing with PIP2 (17Banno Y. Nakashima T. Kumada T. Ebisawa K. Nonomura Y. Nozawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6488-6494Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Sun H. Lin K. Yin H.L. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 811-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). However, this is unlikely for PLD inhibition, since in our experiment a gelsolin-induced decrease in PLD2 activity could not be abrogated by increasing PIP2concentration. Sun et al. (18Sun H. Lin K. Yin H.L. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 811-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) recently reported that PLD is physically associated with gelsolin based on experiments using partially purified PLD from rabbit brain. However, we could not find any association with gelsolin when PLD1 or PLD2 from overexpressed NIH 3T3 cell lysates was immunoprecipitated using specific antibodies. Our study demonstrated that overexpression of gelsolin in NIH 3T3 cells modified agonist-stimulated PLC and PLD activation. Thus, gelsolin overexpression repressed bradykinin-mediated PLC and PLD activation but did not affect PLD activation by PMA, ionophore A23187, and S1P. Several lines of evidence indicate that PKC plays a major role in agonist-induced PLD activation in a variety of cell types (1Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15579-15582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 2Exton J.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1436: 105-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Furthermore, recent studies have demonstrated that PKC-α and PKC-β are the principal regulator of PLD activity (2Exton J.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1436: 105-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 41Kiss Z. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1996; 80: 81-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 42Ohguchi K. Banno Y. Nakashima S. Nozawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4366-4372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) and that the regulatory domain of PKC-α itself is an effective activator of PLD (43Singer W.D. Brown H.A. Jiang X. Sternweis P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4504-4510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). PKC activation is thought to be due to activation of PLC isozymes, which hydrolyze PIP2 to generate inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and diacylglycerol. The resultant increase in diacylglycerol and Ca2+ leads to activation and translocation of conventional PKC isozymes. Thus, the interaction of PKC with PLD in membranes may be sufficient to induce PLD activation. PLD activation was abolished in PKC-down-regulated cells, suggesting that PLC acts upstream of PLD. The involvement of PLC/PKC in PLD regulation by growth factors has been shown by studies using mouse embryonic fibroblasts with disrupted PLCγ1 gene (44Hess J.A. Ji Q. Carpenter G. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20517-20524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Our studies demonstrated here that gelsolin overexpression inhibited bradykinin-stimulated PLCβ activity, thereby leading to repression of activation of PKC-α and PKC-β1 but not PKC-ε. Therefore, the reduced PLD response to bradykinin in gelsolin-overexpressed cells may be secondary to repressed PKC-α activation. This notion was further supported by the finding that PMA- or A23187-induced PLD activation was unaffected by gelsolin overexpression. Considered together, these results suggest that bradykinin-mediated PLD activation may be attributed to PKC-dependent PLD1. PLD1 activation is mediated by several factors such as PKC (-α, -β) and small G proteins (ARF, Rho family, and Ral) (1Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15579-15582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 2Exton J.H. Biochim. Biophys.

Frohman M.A. Morris A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3860-3868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). We also noted that bradykinin stimulation increased RhoA level in membranes of control cells, whereas its level was decreased in gelsolin-overexpressed cells (data not shown). Therefore, reduced RhoA levels might be also responsible for the reduced PLD response to bradykinin in gelsolin overexpressed cells. On the other hand, PLD2 is independent of PLC activation, since it is not activated by PKC and small G proteins (1Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15579-15582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 2Exton J.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1436: 105-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). S1P stimulation induced PLC and PLD activation and translocation of PKC (-α, -β1) in NIH 3T3 cells. Gelsolin overexpression reduced PLC response to S1P and translocation of PKC-α and PKC-β1 but did not affect PLD activation. These results indicated that S1P-induced PLD activation was PKC-independent and involved PLD2, which was abundantly present in NIH3T3 cells. Furthermore, our preliminary experiments gave supportive data suggesting that PLD2 is involved in S1P-induced PLD activation. In NIH 3T3 cells transiently transfected with hemagglutinin-tagged PLD2 cDNA, there was 1.5-fold increase in S1P-induced PLD activation, whereas cells transfected with catalytically inactive PLD2 mutants showed reduced PLD activation in response to S1P (data not shown). These observations suggest that gelsolin represses bradykinin-induced PLD1 activation via PLC/PKC suppression but does not affect S1P-induced PLD2 activation. Our findings that S1P-mediated signaling involving activation of PLC, PKC-α, and MAP kinase was sensitive to PTX treatment but PLD activation was insensitive to such treatment indicate that PLD activation is independent of these signaling components. This notion is consistent with the S1P signaling pathway in Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts (30Goodemote K.A. Mattie M.E. Berger A. Spiegel S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10272-10277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). There are three subfamilies of S1P receptor (EDG1, EDG3, and EDG5) (35An S. Goetzl E.J. Lee H. J. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 30/31: 147-157Crossref Google Scholar). EDG1 is coupled to Gi/o protein, which mediates the signaling pathway involving PLC, adenylate cyclase, and MAP kinase (47Okamoto H.

In contrast, EDG3 and EDG5 mediate the pathways via the Gi, Gq, and G12/13 (35An S. Goetzl E.J. Lee H. J. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 30/31: 147-157Crossref Google Scholar, 46Gonda K. Okamoto H. Takuwa N. Yatomi Y. Okazaki H. Sakurai T. Kimura S. Sillard R. Harii K. Takuwa Y. Biochem. J. 1999; 337: 67-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been reported that in Chinese hamster ovary cells stably expressing EDG1 receptor, S1P induces MAP kinase activation in a PTX- and genistein-sensitive but PKC-independent manner (30Goodemote K.A. Mattie M.E. Berger A. Spiegel S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10272-10277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). In comparison, our study demonstrated that S1P- stimulated MAP kinase activation was PTX-sensitive and PKC-dependent but tyrosine kinase-insensitive. These results indicate that in NIH3T3 fibroblasts, S1P-induced MAP kinase activation was mediated via Gi but not EDG1. PLC activation induced by bradykinin and S1P stimulation were suppressed by gelsolin overexpression, whereas MAP kinase activation by both agonists was not affected. These results suggest that S1P induced PLD activation via certain G proteins distinct from Gi for PLC and the MAP kinase pathway in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts. Recently, PLD2 was demonstrated to be involved in insulin-dependent MAP kinase pathway (8Cross M.J. Roberts S. Ridley A.J. Hodgkin M.N. Stewart A. Claesson-Welsh L. Wakeleam M.J.O. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 588-597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our results, however, suggested that neither PLC nor PLD is associated with MAP kinase activation in S1P-stimulated NIH 3T3 fibroblasts. We thank Dr. M. A. Frohman (State University of New York) for providing cDNA of human PLD1 and PLD2."

Recent studies have identified several kinetochore proteins that have a pivotal role in centromere structure, kinetochore formation, and sister chromatid separation (1Rieder C.L. Salmon E.D.

However, the complete protein composition of the kinetochore and the precise dynamic function of centromere-kinetochore complex during mitosis have not yet been clearly determined. The centromeric heterochromatin between kinetochores contain a number of α-satellite DNA, CENP-B (6Cooke C.A. Bernat R.L. Earnshaw W.C. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 1475-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), and an inner centromere protein INCENP (7Mackay A.M. Ainsztein A.M. Eckley D.M. Earnshaw W.C. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 991-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) that might be involved in maintaining sister-chromatid cohesion. This region also appears to contain mitotic centromere-associated kinesin (MCAK)1 (8Wordeman L. Mitchison T.J. J.

Desai A. Cell. 1996; 84: 37-47Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). Immunoelectron microscopic analyses revealed that the kinetochores consist of four structurally differentiated domains: inner plate, interzone, outer plate, and fibrous corona. The inner plate is closely associated with the centromeric heterochromatin and contains CENP-C (10Tomkiel J. Cooke C.A. Saitoh H. Bernat R.L. Earnshaw W.C. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 531-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), which is required for the maintenance of a functional kinetochore, and CENP-G (11He D. Zeng C. Woods K. Zhong L. Turner D.

The zone between the inner and outer plates (the interzone) contains a phosphorylated protein, of which phosphopeptide-epitope can be recognized by 3F3/2 antibody and which has been proposed to regulate metaphase-anaphase transition through the spindle assembly checkpoint (12Campbell M.S.

We report here the isolation of an additional kinetochore protein called CENP-H, which is constitutively localized in kinetochores and thus may function in kinetochore organization and function. Poly(A)+ mRNA was purified from erythropoietin-responsive mouse erythroleukemia SKT6 cells (28Todokoro K. Kanazawa S. Amanuma H. Ikawa Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 4126-4130Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), and the cDNA library was constructed in λZipLoxTM phage (Life Technologies, Inc.). The digoxigenin-labeled 330 bp CENP-H cDNA, which was incidentally obtained by differential display, was used for screening the library. Four positive clones were isolated from 5 × 105plaques, and their sequences were determined. The 5′ end of the CENP-H transcript was determined by 5′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends (5′-RACE) methods, following the manufacturer's instructions (Life Technologies, Inc.). The cDNAs for 5′-RACE were synthesized by SuperScriptTM II (Life Technologies, Inc.) at 50 °C for 30 min or by ThermoScriptTM (Life Technologies, Inc.) for 60 min at 55 °C with a primer CCGAAGTGCAACTGAAA. The primers used for PCR were GACAGACCCCGCTTCTCT or TCCATTGCAAAGGCCCGCTAGGTT, both of which resulted in the isolation of the identical cDNA. The GenBankTM/EBI/DDBJ accession number of mouse CENP-H is AB017634. The CENP-H cDNA encoding amino acid residues 27 to 241 was cloned into pGEX-2T (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The GST-fused CENP-H was expressed in XL1-Blue MRF′ with 0.1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside and isolated by affinity chromatography on glutathione-Sepharose beads according to the manufacturer's protocol (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The purified GST fusion protein was used to immunize a rabbit. Antibody was affinity-purified with GST-CENP-H fusion protein coupled to HiTrap NHS-activated Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Semi-quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR of various mouse tissues and embryos at various stages of development was conducted using Mouse Rapid-ScanTM Panel (Origene) containing cDNAs of 4-log ranged dilution. The primers used were CAGTTGCACTTCGGGATAACA and TAGCGTGTTGAGGTCCTTCT corresponding to 405–425 and 800–820 bp of CENP-H cDNA. The PCR (30 cycles) was carried at 94 °C for 30 s, 62 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 2 min using 0.4 μm primer per reaction. The expression of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was examined as a control. Mouse NIH/3T3 fibroblasts cultured on 24 × 60 mm coverslips were washed twice with PHEM (60 mm PIPES, 25 mm HEPES, pH 6.9, with KOH, 10 mm EGTA, 2 mm MgCl2) and incubated for 1 min at room temperature. Cells on the coverslips were fixed with methanol at −20 °C for 5 min, immediately dried, and washed briefly with PBS. The coverslips were incubated with primary antibodies in an antibody solution (0.1 m PIPES-KOH, pH 7.2, 1 mm MgSO4, 1 mm EGTA, 1.83%l-lysine, 1% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% NaN3) for 1 h at 37 °C. Primary antibodies used were: purified rabbit anti-CENP-H antibody (1:10 dilution), human anti-centromere autoimmune serum (29Nagata Y. Muro Y. Todokoro K. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 449-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) (1:500 dilution), or rat anti-tyrosinated α-tubulin antibody (Biosys) (1:20 dilution). After washing with PBS, the coverslips were incubated with Cy3-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody (1:1500 dilution), fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated anti-rat antibody (1:50 dilution) and/or anti-human antibody (all three antibodies from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) (1:50 dilution) in antibody solution containing 1 μg/ml DAPI for 45 min at 37 °C, washed three times with PBS for 3 min, and mounted on slides with 90% glycerol and 10% 10× PBS containing 1,4-para-phenylene diamine. Samples were observed with a fluorescence microscope (Olympus BX60 equipped with U-ULS 100HG) and photographed. During the course of isolation of erythropoietin-inducible transcripts by differential display method in erythropoietin-responsive mouse SKT6 cells (28Todokoro K. Kanazawa S. Amanuma H. Ikawa Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 4126-4130Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), a cDNA fragment encoding a novel kinetochore protein was incidentally isolated. We called it CENP-H because of its constitutive subcellular localization in kinetochores (see below). The full-length CENP-H cDNA was isolated from SKT6 cDNA library constructed in λZipLoxTM phage using 330-bp cDNA fragment as a probe, and the translational initiation site was confirmed by 5′-RACE method using SuperScript II at 50 °C or ThermoScriptTMat 60 °C. The sequence analysis of the isolated cDNA revealed that it encodes a novel protein. Fig.1 A shows the confirmed full-length mouse CENP-H sequence. The sequence surrounding the first ATG is in agreement with that of the translational initiation site (so-called Kozak consensus sequence) (30Kozak M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 229-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (2810) Google Scholar). The cDNA encodes a polypeptide of 241 amino acids, and its predicted molecular mass is 28,135 daltons. The predicted isoelectric point is 5.35. The encoded protein contains a coiled-coil structure (amino acids 28 to 187) and a nuclear localization signal RKKR (amino acids 152 to 155) (Fig.1 B), indicating that it might be located in nucleus and bind to another protein through this coiled-coil structure. Northern blot analysis showed CENP-H transcripts at 1.5 kilobases in SKT6 and many other hematopoietic cell lines (data not shown), but their expression levels were too low to exactly quantify by Northern blots. Therefore, to determine the transcriptional levels of mouse CENP-H gene in various tissues, a Mouse Rapid-ScanTM panel was used for the quantification (Fig.2). The primers used were designed to amplify 415-bp fragment (405–820 bp), and the PCR was performed in a series of dilutions of cDNA, of which 1× contains 2.5 pg of cDNA (Fig. 2). Among 16 tissues and 4 embryos at different developmental stages, the most abundant transcript was found in embryos of day 9.5 (Fig. 2). The transcripts were detectable in various tissues except brain, heart, and adrenal gland. It was relatively abundantly expressed in thymus, spleen, uterus, ovary, testis, and muscle, but weakly expressed in small intestine, lung, and stomach. Expression in kidney, liver, skin, and prostate gland was barely detectable. In embryos, it was abundantly expressed between day 9.5 and day 12.5. One of the housekeeping enzymes glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was equally expressed in all tissues and embryos were examined (data not shown). The CENP-H transcripts could be detected in most tissues but they were relatively abundant in proliferating tissues, whereas the transcriptional levels might not reflect the protein level in a cell. To determine the subcellular localization of CENP-H, we performed indirect immunofluorescence microscopic analyses with the affinity purified anti-CENP-H antibody in NIH/3T3 cells. The CENP-H of 33 kDa was detected by the antibody in mouse NIH/3T3 fibroblast cells (data not shown). Because there exists a nuclear localization signal in CENP-H, it was expected to be localized in the nucleus. CENP-H was indeed found in the nucleus during interphase (Fig. 3,lane 1, top panel), and surprisingly, a number of paired CENP-H stainings on the chromosomes were clearly visible throughout the cell cycle (Fig. 3, lanes 1–6, top panels). The paired CENP-H stainings were always seen during mitosis: in prophase (Fig. 3, lane 2), prometaphase (Fig. 3,lane 3), metaphase (Fig. 3, lane 4), anaphase (Fig. 3, lane 5), and telophase (Fig. 3, lane 6). Double stainings of the cells with anti-centromere antibody (Fig.4, lanes 1–5, second panels) together with anti-CENP-H antibody (Fig. 4, lanes 1–5, top panels) revealed that these paired dots on the chromosomes were centromeres/kinetochores of the sister chromatids (Fig. 4). In triple stainings (CENP-H, centromere, and DNA), the stainings of CENP-H completely overlapped with those of centromeres (Fig. 4, bottom panels). Therefore, we concluded that the newly isolated cDNA encodes a novel kinetochore protein and thus designated it CENP-H.Figure 4CENP-H in centromeres/kinetochores throughout the cell cycle. NIH/3T3 cells in interphase (lane 1), prophase (lane 2), metaphase (lane 3), and anaphase (lane 4) or telophase (lane 5) were stained with anti-CENP-H-specific rabbit antibody (top panels), anti-centromere human autoimmune serum (second panels), and DAPI (third panels). The Cy3-conjugated anti-rabbit or FITC-conjugated anti-human IgG was used as secondary antibody. The combinations of all three fluorochromes are shown in thebottom panels.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In reporting this isolation of a novel kinetochore protein CENP-H, which is constitutively localized in kinetochores throughout the cell cycle, we have hypothesized that CENP-H may play a role in kinetochore organization and function. At least 5 proteins, CENP-A, CENP-B, CENP-C, CENP-D, and CENP-G, are known to be constitutively associated with kinetochores throughout the cell cycle. These proteins are thought to be involved in maintaining the structure of chromatides and kinetochores. In contrast, CENP-E, CENP-F, MCAK, Mad family, and Bub family, which are transiently associated with kinetochores during mitosis, are thought to have an important function in sister chromatid separation and/or spindle assembly checkpoint. Kalitsis et al. (31Kalitsis P. Fowler K.J. Earle E. Hill J. Choo K.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1136-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) recently reported, however, that mitotic chromosomes of CENP-C knockout mouse embryos displayed a scattered and highly condensed configuration and did not segregate in an ordered fashion, suggesting that some of these constitutively associated kinetochore proteins might also be indispensable not only for organizing kinetochores but also for acting in metaphase-anaphase transition. The CENP-H was found to be a coiled-coil protein. Thus the possibility that CENP-H interacts with other kinetochore proteins is required study. The antibody we prepared could recognize human CENP-H in immunofluorescence stainings but not in immunoprecipitation or immunoblot. Thus we were unable to examine the interactions with the other known kinetochore proteins CENP-B and CENP-C, of which the available antibodies react only with human proteins. The identification of CENP-H binding proteins must await isolation of its human homologue and preparation of its specific antibody. Further studies are required to understand the detailed structure and dynamic biological functions of kinetochores during mitosis. We thank Y. Muro for anti-centromere antibody and Y. Nagata, K.

Mice deficient in adipose tissue LPL develop adipose tissue lipid stores but only by inducing de novofatty acid biosynthesis from glucose (5Weinstock P.H. Levak-Frank S. Hudgins L.C. Radner H.

These results suggest that tissue lipid content plays important roles in normal physiology and that LPL is essential for the acquisition of exogenous fatty acids by tissues.Fatty acids and glucose compete as respiratory substrates in many tissues (6Randle P.J. Diabetes Metab. Rev. 1998; 14: 263-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar). In muscle, fatty acids inhibit glucose utilization and oxidation. In liver, fatty acids inhibit glucose oxidation and promote gluconeogenesis. In the pancreatic beta cell (7Prentki M. Tornheim K. Corkey B.E. Diabetologia. 1997; 40: 32-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), fatty acids have complex effects that differ depending on the duration of exposure. Since LPL is the dominant provider of fatty acids to tissues and fatty acids alter insulin secretion and glucose utilization, defects in the LPL gene could affect glucose metabolism.Recent reports in mice and humans suggest that LPL genotype affects glucose metabolism. The reason for the death of LPL−/− mice soon after birth (3Coleman T. Seip R.L. Gimble J.M. Lee D. Maeda N. Semenkovich C.F. J. Biol.

LPL−/− humans are rare, but human heterozygous LPL deficiency (LPL+/−) occurs in about 3% of unselected subjects of various ethnic backgrounds (9Benlian P.

It is not yet clear whether such individuals are at increased risk for atherosclerosis, ischemic heart disease, or diabetes. Recently, Nordestgaard and colleagues (12Nordestgaard B. Abildgaard S. Wittrup H. Steffenson R. Jensen G. Tybjaerg-Hansen A. Circulation. 1997; 96: 1737-1744Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) screened Danish subjects for mutations in the LPL gene. As expected, LPL+/− humans had higher triglycerides and lower high density lipoprotein cholesterol. Unexpectedly, these unrelated LPL+/− humans had reduced plasma glucose concentrations compared with LPL+/+ humans. Two previous studies of related LPL+/− humans found no effect on glucose levels (13Wilson D.E. Emi M. Iverius P.-H. Hata A. Wu L.L. Hillas E. Williams R.R. Lalouel J.-M. J. Clin.

Our data show that LPL+/− mice are relatively hypoglycemic. Since LPL provides fatty acids to muscle (the major site of insulin-stimulated glucose disposal) and fatty acids compete with glucose as substrates, we expected LPL+/− mice to have enhanced glucose disposal. There was no such effect. Instead, hypoglycemia in LPL+/− mice appears to be due to hyperinsulinemia. We demonstrate that LPL is expressed in mouse islets, that islets isolated from LPL-deficient mice secrete more insulin than those from wild-type mice, and that manipulating LPL enzyme activity in insulinoma cells alters insulin secretion. Since LPL is responsible for the accumulation of exogenous lipid by tissues, this animal model presents an opportunity to clarify the physiological role of lipid metabolism in insulin secretion by pancreatic beta cells.RESULTSSerum chemistries for LPL+/+ and +/− mice between the ages of 2 and 4 months are shown in Table I. LPL+/− mice in two separate experiments had fasting serum glucose values that were 15–22% (28–39 mg/dl, p = 0.0145 and 0.0021) lower than LPL+/+ mice. As expected, fasting triglycerides were 52–83% (p = 0.0108 and 0.0035) higher in LPL+/− mice, but there were no significant differences in NEFA, body weight, or cholesterol.Table IFasting serum chemistries and body weight in LPL wild-type (LPL+/+)and heterozygous LPL-deficient(LPL+/−) miceLPL+/+LPL+/−pGlucose (mg/dl) Experiment 1181 ± 9142 ± 8aComparisons are with LPL+/+ mice in the same experiment by unpaired, two-tailed t test with significant differences as indicated.0.0145 Experiment 2183 ± 5155 ± 5aComparisons are with LPL+/+ mice in the same experiment by unpaired, two-tailed t test with significant differences as indicated.0.0021Triglycerides (mg/dl) Experiment 154 ± 482 ± 9aComparisons are with LPL+/+ mice in the same experiment by unpaired, two-tailed t test with significant differences as indicated.0.0108 Experiment 246 ± 484 ± 9aComparisons are with LPL+/+ mice in the same experiment by unpaired, two-tailed t test with significant differences as indicated.0.0035Cholesterol (mg/dl) Experiment 160 ± 560 ± 80.9655 Experiment 280 ± 873 ± 50.4359NEFA (mEq/liter) Experiment 10.80 ± 0.040.77 ± 0.060.6615 Experiment 20.63 ± 0.050.75 ± 0.050.0832Body weight (g) Experiment 129 ± 328 ± 30.9167 Experiment 231 ± 131 ± 20.8681Animals were fasted for 4 h before collection of serum.

Open table in a new tab More detailed characterization of glucose metabolism was carried out in mice over the age of 12 months since the larger caliber of the tail vein at this age simplifies glucose tolerance testing. Blood glucose values in chow-fed mice over the age of 12 months were 181 ± 3 mg/dl for LPL+/+ (n = 39) versus 170 ± 3 mg/dl for LPL+/− (n = 34) (p = 0.0137). In two additional groups over the age of 12 months matched for weight and sex, the blood glucose after a 4-h fast was as follows: group 1, 187 ± 5 for +/+ versus 163 ± 3 mg/dl for +/− (p = 0.0003); group 2, 191 ± 9 for +/+versus 169 ± 4 for +/− (p = 0.036). These mice underwent glucose tolerance testing after a 4-h fast. Data for group 1 are shown in Fig. 1. Similar results were seen for group 2. Both genotypes had similar glucose excursions although values in the +/− mice tended to be lower throughout the test and returned to significantly lower levels in LPL+/− mice at 150 min after the glucose injection.Insulin levels were higher in LPL+/− compared with +/+ mice (Fig.2). In chow-fed mice between the ages of 2 and 4 months (left side of figure), fasting serum insulin levels were 0.81 ± 0.21 for +/+ versus 1.90 ± 0.44 for +/− (Mann-Whitney two-tailed p = 0.0251). High fat feeding is known to elevate insulin levels in mice. When mice were fed a high fat diet for 6 weeks, insulin levels were elevated in both genotypes but remained higher in LPL+/−mice (right side of figure). In a large group of mice with the same mean weight by genotype, insulin levels were 2.09 ± 0.37 (n = 30) for +/+ mice versus 4.38 ± 1.03 (n = 25) for +/− mice (Mann-Whitney two-tailedp = 0.0286). Thus, heterozygous LPL deficiency is associated with relative hypoglycemia in the setting of hyperinsulinemia.Figure 2Fasting insulin levels. Animals were fasted for 4 h.

To address this issue, hyperinsulinemic clamp experiments were carried out in chow-fed LPL+/+ (n = 6) and LPL+/− (n = 7) mice after a 4-h fast. During the clamp period, glucose and insulin levels were the same in both genotypes (data not shown). The tracer-determined rates of glucose utilization were identical for the two genotypes during the basal period (Fig. 3). The insulin-stimulated rates of glucose utilization were the same for LPL+/+ and +/− mice (Fig. 3) indicating that the LPL+/− mice were not insulin-resistant.Figure 3The effect of LPL deficiency on basal glucose utilization and insulin responsiveness in mice. Tracer determined rates of glucose utilization represent three measurements made during the last 15 min of the basal period and the last 20 min of the clamp period for LPL+/+ (solid bars, n = 6) and LPL+/− (open bars, n = 7) mice.

A single band of the correct predicted size (∼573 base pairs) was seen using RNA from LPL+/+ mouse islets (lane 1) but did not appear when the RT step was omitted from the reaction (lane 2). The same band was seen using RNA from mouse heart (lane 3). Islets also contain non-insulin-producing cells raising the possibility that the LPL mRNA signal is derived solely from cells that do not synthesize insulin. However, the same RT-PCR band was also seen in INS-1 cells (lane 4), which are derived from rat pancreatic beta cells. In addition, an LPL mRNA species of the correct size for rat (22Semenkovich C.F. Chen S.-H. Wims M. Luo C.-C. Li W.-H. Chan L. J. Lipid Res. 1989; 30: 423-431Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was detected by Northern blotting using RNA from INS-1 cells (data not shown). These data suggest that insulin-producing islet cells express LPL.Figure 4LPL is expressed in pancreatic islets and INS-1 cells. Islets from LPL+/+ mice were isolated by density gradient sedimentation followed by selection with a microscope to exclude contaminating tissues. Total RNA was prepared and subjected to RT-PCR using LPL-specific primers. Products were electrophoresed in agarose gels and stained with ethidium bromide. The source of the RNA was as follows: lane 1, LPL+/+ islets; lane 2, LPL+/+ islets but the RT step was omitted to ensure that positive bands were not due to PCR artifact; lane 3, mouse heart;lane 4, INS-1 cells. The bands from lanes 1 and3 were cut from this gel and sequenced. The products of the reactions yielded sequence identical to mouse LPL.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The amplified band from lane 1 of Fig. 4 was sequenced and found to be mouse LPL (Table II). To provide additional evidence that islets express LPL, RNA was prepared from human pancreatic islets and subjected to RT-PCR using two sets of primers. Both reactions yielded PCR products of the predicted size, and the sequence of both bands matched that of human LPL (Table II).If LPL provides lipoprotein-derived fatty acids to beta cells, it must be secreted. To address this issue, mouse (30 islets per aliquot) and human (100 islets per aliquot) islets were washed then incubatedin vitro for 30 min as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The media from these incubations were collected and assayed for LPL enzyme activity. Under these conditions, LPL activity in the medium exposed to mouse islets (n = 10 aliquots) was 10.2 ± 5 pmol/30 islets/min. LPL activity in the medium exposed to human islets (n = 4 aliquots) was 4.8 ± 2 pmol/100 islets/min.To determine if there is an effect of LPL genotype on LPL enzyme activity in islets, islets from LPL+/− and LPL+/+ mice were homogenized and assayed for activity (TableIII). Islets from LPL+/− mice contained 48% of the enzyme activity of LPL+/+ islets. The level of enzyme activity in LPL+/+ islets was 5–13% of the enzyme activity found in cardiac tissue from LPL+/+ mice (Ref. 3Coleman T. Seip R.L. Gimble J.M. Lee D. Maeda N. Semenkovich C.F. J.

Triglyceride content was modestly but significantly lower in LPL+/− islets (Table III); similar results were seen in three independent experiments. Overall triglyceride content of islets was substantial. A typical islet contains about 2,000 cells (27Turk J. Wolf B.A. McDaniel M.L. Prog. Lipid Res. 1987; 26: 125-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), yielding an estimated triglyceride content of 80 ng/cell.

Open table in a new tab Under conditions of basal glucose concentration (3 mm), islets isolated from LPL-deficient mice secreted more insulin in vitro than islets from LPL+/+ mice (Fig.5). These conditions are comparable to the fasting, basal state in intact mice, in which we detect relative hypoglycemia (Fig. 1) and hyperinsulinemia (Fig. 2). Secretion studies were performed immediately after islet isolation suggesting that islet metabolism reflected the availability of in vivo circulating substrates such as triglycerides. LPL+/− islets (open bar) cultured for 30 min in 3 mm glucose secreted 5-fold more insulin than LPL+/+ islets (closed bar). Islets were also isolated from mice expressing LPL only in muscle (L0-MCK, Refs. 5Weinstock P.H. Levak-Frank S. Hudgins L.C. Radner H. Friedman J.M. Zechner R. Breslow J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

LPL−/− islets from these mice (hatched bar) also secreted more insulin than LPL+/+ islets.Figure 5In vitro insulin secretion by isolated mouse pancreatic islets.

(n = 4 per genotype).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To address directly the role of LPL enzyme activity in mediating insulin secretion, LPL activity was manipulated in INS-1 cells (Figs. 6 and7). For these experiments, cells were maintained in serum-containing medium until just prior to measurements of insulin secretion. LPL enzyme activity was detected in INS-1 cells and was unaffected by treatment with a viral vector expressing β-galactosidase (AAV-β-galactosidase). Basal LPL activity in INS-1 cells was between 4 and 10% of the activity detected in mouse islets. Treatment of these cells with a viral vector expressing human LPL (AAV-LPL) resulted in higher levels of LPL enzyme activity and lower levels of insulin secretion (Fig. 6). Similar results were seen in three independent experiments. These data indicate that increasing LPL enzyme activity in insulin-producing cells decreases basal insulin secretion. There was no effect of LPL overexpression on glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (not shown).Figure 6LPL overexpression in INS-1 insulinoma cells suppresses basal insulin secretion. INS-1 cells were grown to 80% confluence, and then parallel cluster dishes were infected with AAV-LPL (hatched bars) or AAV-β-galactosidase (open bars) at 1011 plaque-forming units/ml. Five days after infection, one set of dishes was assayed for LPL enzyme activity and the other set was used to measure insulin secretion.

Antisense-treated cells had a 28% increase in insulin secretion as compared with Scrambled-treated cells. Similar results were seen in four independent experiments.DISCUSSIONFatty acids affect insulin secretion. LPL provides lipoprotein-derived fatty acids to tissues. In this report, we provide evidence that LPL is expressed in islets. We also show that LPL+/− mice have lower circulating glucose concentrations and higher insulin levels as compared with their LPL+/+ littermates. These mice have no evidence of insulin resistance.Three lines of evidence suggest that hyperinsulinemia in LPL+/− mice is due to an increased rate of insulin secretion. First, in the hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp experiments, insulin concentrations were equal in the LPL+/+ and +/− mice at the end of the clamp, indicating that at least under the conditions of the clamp, LPL deficiency does not affect the rate of insulin clearance. Second, islets from LPL-deficient mice secrete more insulin than islets from wild-type mice. Third, changing LPL activity in INS-1 cells is inversely related to insulin secretion, i.e.increasing LPL activity decreases insulin secretion and decreasing LPL activity increases insulin secretion.LPL is often considered in the context of glucose metabolism because it is insulin-responsive (23Semenkovich C.F. Wims M. Noe L. Etienne J. Chan L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9030-9038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Ong J.M. Kirchgessner T.G. Schotz M.C. Kern P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 12933-12938Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Patients with poorly controlled diabetes frequently have dyslipidemia due to defects in LPL enzyme activity (31Semenkovich C.F. Heinecke J.W. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 327-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). However, screening of patients with type 2 diabetes and extreme hypertriglyceridemia has provided no evidence that genetic LPL deficiency contributes to the high frequency of lipid disorders in diabetics (32Elbein S.C. Yeager C. Kwong L.K. Lingam A. Inoue I. Lalouel J.M. Wilson D.E. J. Clin. Endocrinol. & Metab. 1994; 79: 1450-1456Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). If the current results can be extrapolated to humans, they suggest an explanation for the failure to detect LPL mutations in diabetes. Genetic LPL deficiency may produce lower glucose concentrations thereby decreasing the likelihood of meeting the biochemical criteria for diabetes.How does deficient islet LPL enzyme activity increase insulin secretion? The most obvious mechanism would involve a decrease in the provision of triglyceride-derived fatty acids to the islet. A large and frankly confusing body of literature spanning 30 years addresses the role of fatty acids in insulin secretion.Acute treatment of pancreatic islets or intact rats with free fatty acids increases glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (33Montague W. Taylor K. Nature. 1968; 217: 853-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 34Crespin S. Greenough W. Steinberg D. J. Clin.

Barker B. Metabolism. 1968; 17: 301-304Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Chronic treatment impairs glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (38Elks M. Endocrinology. 1993; 133: 208-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 39Sako Y. Grill V. Endocrinology. 1990; 127: 1580-1589Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). But these effects are not limited to glucose-stimulated insulin secretion; fatty acids also alter basal insulin release. At least three independent groups have shown that chronic exposure of islets to fatty acids enhances insulin secretion at glucose concentrations from 0 to 5.6 mm (40Zhou Y.-P. Grill V. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 870-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar, 41Liang Y. Buettger C. Berner D.K. Matschinsky F.M.

Invest. 1998; 101: 1094-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), an effect that might ultimately deplete insulin stores and increase the risk for diabetes. Unger and colleagues (43Lee Y. Hirose H. Zhou Y.-T. Esser V. McGarry J. Unger R. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 408-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) have proposed that deranged lipid metabolism may cause beta cell failure based on evidence that islet triglycerides rise in Zucker rats before the onset of overt diabetes.These observations are difficult to reconcile with the enhanced insulin secretion seen in the setting of heterozygous LPL deficiency. Serum-free fatty acid levels are not elevated in LPL+/− mice. Since fatty acids chronically increase basal insulin secretion in cultured cells, one would expect basal insulin secretion to decrease when fewer fatty acids are delivered to the islet due to heterozygous LPL deficiency. The opposite was observed. LPL+/− islets, provided with fewer triglyceride-derived fatty acids, secrete more insulin. In this sense, our data are consistent with the concept of “l"

Thus, identifying and characterizing dsRNA-binding proteins may help to advance our understanding of the fundamental processes regulating cell growth. C2H2 type zinc finger (ZF) proteins comprise one of the largest gene families (6Rhodes D. Klug A. Sci. Am. 1993; 268: 56-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 7Berg J.M. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1990; 19: 405-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Development of molecular biological techniques and structural studies have further promoted cloning of novel ZF proteins (8Becker K.G. Nagle J.W. Canning R.D. Biddison W.E. Ozato K. Drew P.D. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1995; 4: 685-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). For most of these proteins the biological function(s) has not been determined, but a role as a DNA-binding protein in gene transcription is considered a likely mechanism of action. However, Xenopus TFIIIA is a unique protein requiring the first three ZF domains to bind 5 S DNA but can also bind helical stems of 5 S RNA with the next three finger domains (6Rhodes D. Klug A. Sci. Am. 1993; 268: 56-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 9Shastry B.S. Experientia ( Basel ). 1993; 49: 831-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The recognition of RNA is thought to be primarily dependent on the 5 S RNA structure (10Pieler T. Bellefroid E. Mol. Biol. Rep. 1994; 20: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Some ZF proteins are reported to bind RNA homopolymers (11Koster M. Kuhn U. Bouwmeester T. Nietfeld W. El-Baradi T. Knochel W. Pieler T. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3087-3093Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Recently, Xenopus dsRBP-ZFa has been characterized as a unique C2H2-type ZF protein that can specifically bind dsRNA and RNA-DNA hybrids (12Finerty P.J. Bass B.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 271: 195-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In eukaryotic cells, the nucleus is separated from the cytoplasm where protein synthesis occurs. Therefore, all nuclear proteins must be selectively transported into the nucleus. Protein transport across the nuclear envelope is usually mediated by specific nuclear localization signals (NLS) (13Nigg E.A. Nature. 1997; 386: 779-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (914) Google Scholar, 14Izaurralde E. Adam S. RNA ( NY ). 1998; 4: 351-364PubMed Google Scholar). Over the past several years, remarkable progress has been made in ordering the events and factors involving in the nuclear transporting systems (13Nigg E.A. Nature. 1997; 386: 779-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (914) Google Scholar, 14Izaurralde E. Adam S. RNA ( NY ). 1998; 4: 351-364PubMed Google Scholar). However, it is not clear whether all nuclear proteins use common factors and pathways to gain entrance. Here, we have identified a mammalian dsRNA-binding ZF protein, JAZ, that requires ZF domains not only for dsRNA binding but also for its nuclear localization. NIH3T3 cells and COS7 cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection and were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% calf serum. The mouse interleukin-3-dependent NFS/N1.H7 cells were grown and maintained as described previously (15Boswell H.S. Mochizuki D.Y. Burgess G.S. Gillis S. Walker E.B. Anderson D. Williams D.E. Exp. Hematol. 1990; 18: 794-800PubMed Google Scholar). By using PCR-based mutagenesis, the BamHI fragment of mouse PKR cDNA (16Icely P.L. Gros P. Bergeron J.J. Devault A. Afar D.E. Bell J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16073-16077Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) cloned in pBluescript KS was first mutated at lysine 271 to arginine to generate the catalytically inactive PKR[K271R], the mouse equivalent to human PKR[K296R] mutant (17Meurs E.F. Galabru J. Barber G.N. Katze M.G. Hovanessian A.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 232-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar), and then subcloned into a GAL4-DNA-binding domain vector pGBT9 (CLONTECH). A random primed NFS/N1.H7 cell cDNA library was generated in GAL4-activation domain vector pGAD10 (CLONTECH). The yeast two-hybrid screening of the cDNA library was performed according to the Matchmaker Two-hybrid System protocol (CLONTECH). The host yeast HF7c cells were sequentially transformed with PKR[K271R]/pGBT9 and pGAD10 library plasmids and plated on medium lacking tryptophan, leucine, and histidine. A total of 4 × 106 clones was screened for growth in the selection medium and assayed for β-galactosidase activity. The plasmids harvested from positive clones were used to transform Escherichia coliHB101 (leuB−), cells and the library plasmids were recovered from the E. coli colonies grown on the plates lacking leucine. The cDNA synthesis and the adapter ligation for RACE was performed using Marathon cDNA Amplification Kit (CLONTECH) and poly(A) RNA extracted from either mouse NFS/N1.H7 cells or human placenta (CLONTECH). Based on the sequence of clone 112 obtained from the yeast two-hybrid screening, an antisense primer 5′-CTGACCAGGCAGGGACAGCTTTAGT-3′ and a sense primer 5′-GAGCAGGTCTTCCAGGAAGTATTCC-3′ were prepared for use in the 5′- and 3′-RACE, respectively, to obtain full-length mouse JAZ cDNA. Using the National Center for Biotechnology Institute BLAST search, a human expressed sequence tags clone (GenBankTMaccession number F06769) was identified that is homologous to an area in the middle of mouse JAZ cDNA, whereas another clone (GenBankTM accession number R56173) was found to be homologous to the 3′-end of the coding region for mouse JAZ. For 5′-RACE of human JAZ, an antisense primer 5′-CCTTAGTGGACTGCTGCTTCAGCTT -3′ was used since the complementary sequence was found in both mouse JAZ and the F06769 clone. To obtain the full coding sequence for human JAZ, PCR was performed between the sequence 5′-AGCAGCAGAAGCAAAGACAAGAACC-3′, found in both mouse JAZ and F06769, and 5′-GGTGATTCTGCCCAGCATCCCATATT-3′, found in R56173. Each PCR was performed by the step down method (18Hecker K.H. Roux K.H. BioTechniques. 1996; 20: 478-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar) using Takara LA TaqDNA polymerase (PanVera, Madison, WI) pretreated with TaqStart Antibody (CLONTECH). The cycling condition consisted of 1 min denaturation at 94 °C, 3 min elongation at 68 °C with the annealing temperature progressively lowered from 68 to 45 °C by 3 °C every fourth cycle, followed by an additional 35 cycles at 55 °C. The PCR product was gel-purified and ligated into the pCRII vector (Invitrogen) which was used to transform E. coliDH5α. Multiple clones were selected to analyze the sequence of each RACE product. A mouse multiple tissue blot was obtained from CLONTECH and probed with a 2-kilobase pair JAZ cDNA fragment (clone 112) that was radiolabeled using RadPrime DNA labeling system (Life Technologies, Inc.). To produce a glutathioneS-transferase (GST)-JAZ fusion protein, JAZ cDNA (clone 112) was subcloned into pGEX1λT vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The fusion protein was expressed in E. coli DH5α and purified by glutathione-agarose affinity chromatography according to the manufacturer's instruction. The 130-mer dsRNA and 160-mer RNA-DNA hybrid probes were prepared as described (19Bass B.L. Hurst S.R. Singer J.D. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 301-314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The pBluescript II SK vector (Stratagene) was digested with BssHII to produce a 172-bp DNA fragment containing the T7 and T3 promoters and intervening template sequences. This BssHII fragment was also used as a DNA competitor or a radiolabeled 170-mer DNA probe after 5′-end-labeling using T4 polynucleotide kinase (Life Technologies, Inc.) and [γ-32P]ATP. The 160-nucleotide single-stranded (ss) RNAs were synthesized using T7 and T3 RNA polymerase MAXIscript in vitro transcription kits (Ambion) in the presence or absence of [α-32P]UTP. To make a 130-bp dsRNA, equimolar amounts of the two transcripts were mixed and hybridized in binding buffer (80% formamide, 40 mm PIPES at pH 6.7, 400 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA) (19Bass B.L. Hurst S.R. Singer J.D. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 301-314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). For competition experiments, a large quantity of ssRNA was prepared using the MEGAshortscript in vitro transcription kit (Ambion). The 160-mer RNA/DNA hybrid was synthesized by mixing the T7 transcript (100 pmol), T3 primer (300 pmol), and SuperScript RT II (Life Technologies, Inc.), gel-purified, and used as a cold competitor or radiolabeled probe following the 5′-end-labeling (12Finerty P.J. Bass B.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 271: 195-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The quality was verified by sensitivity to ribonuclease H (Life Technologies, Inc.). The indicated amounts of GST-JAZ and each nucleic acid substrate were incubated in 50 μl of binding buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.3, 20 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 μm ZnCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40) at room temperature for 1 h as described (12Finerty P.J. Bass B.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 271: 195-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Since a kinetic experiment showed no differences in binding following incubation times of 15 min up to 2 h, a 1-h incubation time was chosen (data not shown). Although we used the zinc-containing binding buffer previously used for the analysis of dsRBP-ZFa (12Finerty P.J. Bass B.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 271: 195-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), similar results were obtained using a buffer containing 5 mm EDTA, suggesting that exogenous zinc is not required in this assay (data not shown). The samples were loaded onto an 8% native polyacrylamide gel and run for 2 h at 150 V in buffer containing 45 mmTris borate, pH 8.0, and 1 mm EDTA. The gel was dried and subjected to autoradiography. JAZ cDNA was cloned into the pRSET vector (Invitrogen) in order to generate a polyhistidine-tagged JAZ. The protein was induced in E. coli. BL21 (DE3) pLysS (Novagen, Madison, WI) and partially purified with TALON metal affinity resin according to the manufacturer's instruction (CLONTECH). The fraction containing JAZ was incubated with poly(I·C)-agarose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and the protein was dissociated by boiling in SDS-PAGE sample buffer and further purified by SDS-PAGE. The gel slice containing the recombinant JAZ was used to immunize a rabbit to raise anti-JAZ antiserum (COVANCE Research Products Inc., Denver, PA). The antibody was purified from the serum using protein A-agarose beads as described (20Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 310Google Scholar). NIH3T3 cells were collected from six 100-mm dishes following trypsinization and washed with phosphate-buffered saline. Nuclei and the nuclear lysate were prepared as described (21Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9153) Google Scholar). A preliminary screening of optimal protease inhibitors using a protease inhibitor set (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and lysates from HA-JAZ-transfected NIH3T3 cells revealed that pepstatin and metalloprotease inhibitors were essential in order to protect JAZ from degradation by cellular proteases. For subcellular fractionation, the cells were suspended in lysis buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.7 μg/ml pepstatin, 400 μg/ml phosphoramidone) and lysed using a Dounce homogenizer (type B pestle). The cell lysate was centrifuged for 10 min at 2000 rpm to pellet the nuclei. The supernatant was further centrifuged for 90 min at 150,000 ×g (Beckman XL-80 rotor) to obtain the cytosolic fraction (supernatant). The resulting pellet was dissolved in TBS containing 1% Triton X-100 to obtain the particulate fraction. The nuclei were resuspended in extraction buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 25% glycerol, 0.42 m NaCl, 0.7 μg/ml pepstatin, and 400 μg/ml phosphoramidone) and incubated on ice for 1 h. The nuclear extract was passed through cotton wool to remove insoluble materials and used for the nuclear fraction. The poly(I·C) beads (150 μl) were added to each subcellular fraction and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed three times with TBS containing 1% Triton X-100, and the bound proteins were eluted by boiling in Laemmli buffer. The samples were loaded and run on an SDS-PAGE gel (10%) and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane that was incubated with a 5% milk solution for blocking. The specificity of the JAZ antibody was examined by antigen competition. Duplicate filters were prepared, and each filter was incubated for 1 h with the antibody solution that had been incubated with either GST-JAZ or GST protein alone that had been bound to glutathione-agarose beads. After incubation with secondary antibody for 1 h, the immunoreactive proteins were detected using the ECL system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), The hemagglutinin (HA) epitope-tagged JAZ cDNA was subcloned into the pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen) and transfected into COS7 cells using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.). Forty eight hours later, the cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min at 4 °C and subsequently permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 20 min. After blocking with 3% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline for 1 h, the slips were incubated with 5 μg/ml rhodamine-conjugated 12CA5 antibody (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 1 h. The slides were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, mounted with mounting medium (95% glycerol, 2.5% n-propyl gallate, 2.5% diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane), and analyzed under a fluorescence microscope (Nikon) supplemented with a Micromax digital camera (Princeton Instruments). All site-directed mutagenesis experiments were performed using the Transformer Kit (CLONTECH). An EcoRI/XbaI fragment of HA-JAZ cDNA was cloned into pUC19. A newBamHI site was created at the end of the JAZ-coding region. After the first histidine codon of each ZF domain was mutated to an alanine codon, the EcoRI/BamHI cDNA fragment was cloned into pEGFP-N1 vector (CLONTECH) to create JAZ fused with the amino terminus of GFP (termed Wt-1). The carboxyl-terminal GFP fusion protein was constructed by inserting anXhoI/BamHI fragment containing the coding region of JAZ into pEGFP-C3 (Wt-2). ΔII–IV mutant was created by deleting the NcoI-BamHI fragment followed by blunt-end ligation. Each plasmid was transfected into NIH3T3 cells grown on 6-well plates. After 24 h, subcellular localization of GFP fusion proteins was analyzed using an inverted fluorescence microscope. Each plasmid was transfected into COS7 cells as described above. After 48 h the cells were lysed in buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.15m NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 μg/ml pepstatin). Aliquots (50 μg) of lysates were incubated with 20 μl of poly(I·C)-agarose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in the absence or presence of nucleic acids (poly(C), poly(dI·dC), and poly(I·C), Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 1.5 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed three times with buffer A before boiling in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. The eluted samples and 50 μg of the whole cell lysates were then loaded onto a 10% SDS-PAGE gel followed by immunoblotting using an anti-HA antibody (12CA5, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for HA-JAZ or an anti-GFP antiserum (CLONTECH) for GFP fusion proteins. For quantitative analysis, the blot was incubated with125I-protein A (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) after the primary antibody incubation, and the immunoreactive signal was measured by InstantImager™ (Packard, Meriden, CT). In order to identify proteins that interact with the dsRNA-dependent protein kinase PKR, we screened a mouse NFS/N1.H7 cell cDNA library using the yeast two-hybrid method. One of the positive clones, c122, contained 1926-bp cDNA with an open reading frame of 885 nucleotides that encoded a putative 294 amino acid polypeptide. To obtain the full-length cDNA, we employed RACE using poly(A) RNA from NFS/N1.H7 cells. Although the longest murine 5′-RACE clone obtained did not have a stop codon in the coding frame prior to the putative initiating methionine codon, there is a stop codon 18 bp upstream of the corresponding methionine codon in a human 5′-RACE clone (see below). This suggests that c112 likely contains the entire coding region of the mRNA. The sequence analysis of the 3′-RACE product revealed that JAZ cDNA has a long (2.4-kilobase pair) 3′-untranslated region that precedes a typical polyadenylation signal AATAAA. By using the National Center for Biotechnology Institute BLAST search, we found two human expressed sequence tags sequences in GenBankTM that are homologous to the c112 sequence. The F06769 sequence is homologous to the middle of the coding region, whereas the R56173 sequence is homologous to the 3′-end of the coding region. Based on these expressed sequence tags sequences, we applied RACE to clone the human homologue from human placental RNA. The human cDNA also obtained codes for a putative polypeptide of 294 amino acids with 89% homology to the mouse protein (Fig. 1). Examination of the protein sequence revealed the presence of four homologous C2H2-type ZF domains (ZF domain I–IV in Fig. 1 A). Hereafter, the protein is referred to as JAZ (for just another zinc finger protein). Interestingly, these domains are connected by unusually long linker sequences (i.e. 28–38 amino acids) compared with those of other known ZF proteins that have short (6–8 amino acids), well conserved linkers (7Berg J.M. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1990; 19: 405-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). These unique linkers begin with basic residues and are predicted to form helix-loop structures, in contrast to ZF domains in the other finger proteins that form sheet-helix structures. A National Center for Biotechnology Institute BLAST search found that JAZ is homologous to the amino-terminal half of XenopusdsRBP-ZFa (12Finerty P.J. Bass B.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 271: 195-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The peptide sequences of the four C2H2 domains and the following 6 residues of JAZ are particularly homologous to each other (Fig. 1 B). The dsRBP-ZFa also has long (34–44 amino acids) linkers, but the homology within this region is limited to the first 6 residues. JAZ is missing the last three ZF domains that follow a serine-, proline-, and glycine-rich region present in dsRBP-ZFa (12Finerty P.J. Bass B.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 271: 195-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Therefore, JAZ may not be the mammalian counterpart of dsRBP-ZFa but apparently belongs to the same protein family. Next, the expression and tissue distribution of JAZ was assessed by Northern blot analysis of poly(A) RNA prepared from different mouse tissues. The radiolabeled JAZ cDNA probe was found to hybridize to a single 3.6-kilobase pair species present in all tissues examined (Fig. 1 C). These results indicate that JAZ is a ubiquitously expressed gene. To determine whether JAZ contains nucleic acid binding properties, we conducted gel shift assays. Different types of nucleic acid duplexes were incubated with GST-JAZ and subjected to non-denaturing PAGE analysis. We found that JAZ can bind to dsRNA, RNA/DNA hybrids, and DNA with vastly different affinities. Delayed mobility of the radiolabeled dsRNA or RNA/DNA hybrid probe could be detected following incubation with 500 pm GST-JAZ. Further shifts were observed in a dose-dependent manner, suggesting that the dsRNA (130-mer) and RNA-DNA hybrid (160-mer) probes used have multiple JAZ-binding sites. In contrast, greater than 100 times more JAZ was required to detect any shift of the DNA probe. These results indicate that JAZ has a relatively high affinity for an A-form duplex, especially dsRNA, in vitro (Fig.2 A). To confirm this substrate specificity, the radiolabeled dsRNA probe was incubated with GST-JAZ in the presence of increasing concentrations of nonradioactive dsRNA, RNA-DNA, DNA, or ssRNA. Results show that JAZ binding to the dsRNA is unaffected by DNA but can be greatly reduced by excess dsRNA (Fig. 2 B). An RNA/DNA hybrid can also compete but less potently than dsRNA. Furthermore, slight competition was observed with ssRNA, whereas an RNA homopolymer, poly(C), failed to affect the dsRNA binding. These results suggest that JAZ has no or very low affinity for single-stranded RNA but may bind to intra- or intermolecular duplex portions of the 160-mer ssRNA tested. Furthermore, recombinant JAZ expressed in COS7 cells can efficiently bind dsRNA poly(I·C)-agarose beads, and the binding was competed with free poly(I·C) but not with poly(C) or poly(dI·dC) (Fig.2 C). These results indicate that JAZ expressed in mammalian cells also specifically binds to dsRNA. Since JAZ is a nucleic acid binding protein, we wanted to determine its intracellular localization. The hemagglutinin (HA) epitope-tagged JAZ cDNA was transfected into COS7 cells, and the expressed protein was detected by immunofluorescence microscopy using an anti-HA monoclonal antibody conjugated with rhodamine. Fluorescence was observed exclusively in the nucleus, primarily in the nucleolus (Fig.3 A). To investigate the localization of endogenous JAZ, we produced a polyclonal antibody using the recombinant JAZ fusion protein as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Initial attempts to detect a specific signal by immunoblotting using whole cell lysates from NIH3T3 cells were unsuccessful although an intense signal could be detected in 3T3 cells transiently transfected with JAZ plasmid. These data suggest that endogenous JAZ protein levels may be quite low. Since JAZ efficiently binds dsRNA, nuclear lysates from 1 × 108 cells were incubated with poly(I·C)-agarose beads to concentrate JAZ (Fig. 2). The eluate from the beads was found to contain a 36-kDa protein that was recognized by the antiserum (Fig.3 B, left panel). The apparent molecular mass of the band, 36 kDa, corresponds well with the calculated molecular mass of 33 kDa for JAZ. Any slight difference may suggest post-translational modification of the protein. However, this immunoreactive protein could not be detected in either the cytosolic or the particulate fraction of cells even following concentration with poly(I·C) beads. Moreover, no hybridizing band was detected when the antiserum was adsorbed with an excess amount of the recombinant JAZ before blotting (Fig.3 B, right panel), indicating that the antiserum does specifically recognize JAZ. Collectively, these findings strongly indicate that JAZ is localized to the nucleus. The nuclear/nucleolar localization of JAZ was further studied in living cells using a green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged JAZ construct. When the JAZ-GFP expression plasmid was transiently transfected into NFS/N1.H7 cells, the green fluorescence localized exclusively in the nucleus, particularly in the nucleolus, indicating that GFP fusion does not affect the localization of JAZ (Fig. 3 C). Interestingly, in a metaphase cell in which the nucleolus is absent, the fluorescence signal of JAZ-GFP diffused into the cytoplasm with some patchy accumulations at the prenucleolar bodies and the periphery of mitotic chromosomes (Fig. 3 C, arrowhead andarrow, respectively). This finding indicates that JAZ may bind to chromosome-associated RNA and/or DNA and thus segregate with the dividing chromosome. JAZ contains four C2H2-type ZF domains that appear essential for dsRNA binding. To investigate the contribution of individual ZF domains, site-directed mutagenesis was performed on each domain by changing the first histidine to alanine (C2H2→ C2AH), which destroys the ZF structure (22Coleman J.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 897-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar). The mutant JAZ cDNA was subcloned into a GFP fusion expression vector. To perform the dsRNA binding assay, lysates from COS7 cells transfected with either wild-type or mutant JAZ-GFP were incubated with poly(I·C) beads, and the binding efficiency was analyzed by immunoblotting. Results show that destruction of one ZF domain does not significantly reduce the dsRNA binding capacity of JAZ (I–IV in Fig.4). However, the dsRNA binding efficiency was reduced by 40–60% when either the first and third (I/III) or the second and third (II/III) ZF domains were simultaneously destroyed. Furthermore, mutation of three domains (I/II/III or II/III/IV) even further decreased the binding, and a mutant where all four fingers were mutated (NF) showed no dsRNA binding. On the other hand, ΔII-IV, a mutant that has only one ZF domain and the first 10 amino acids of the HC-linker sequence, showed weak but detectable dsRNA binding. These results suggest that each ZF domain has an affinity for dsRNA. The mutants I/III and II/III retain two intact ZF domains that are separated by a much longer sequence than original linker sequences due to the destruction of the middle domains. Interestingly, mutants retaining two consecutive ZF domains (I/II and III/IV) exhibited much stronger binding than the I/III or II/III mutant. These results suggest that the length of the linker is also important for efficient dsRNA binding. Next, we transfected NIH3T3 cells with wild-type or individual ZF mutant cDNAs in order to analyze the effect of a specific ZF mutation on intracellular JAZ localization. The GFP signal from the vector alone control showed GFP to be distributed diffusely throughout the cell (Fig. 5). As observed in NFS/N1.H7 cells (Fig. 3), the wild-type JAZ-GFP construct showed a nuclear, especially nucleolar, localization pattern (data not shown). This pattern was not altered by mutation of a single ZF domain (see Fig. 5, domain II mutant as an example), and mutants that retained two consecutive fingers still exhibited nucleolar localization (Fig. 5, I/II as a example). However, after transfection with either the I/III or II/III construct (I/III in Fi"

They are tetramers of two homologous subunits (alpha and beta), each of which is essential for the function of the channels in vivo. We have investigated the stoichiometry and arrangement of these two subunits to determine how they come together within an individual channel complex. We exploited the very specific geometric and spatial requirements for forming a high-affinity Ni2+-binding site to examine the number and relative positions of the subunits. We found that only an order of alpha/alpha/beta/beta could account qualitatively and quantitatively for the observed intersubunit coordination of Ni2+ in wild-type and mutant alpha/beta channels. Furthermore, our results suggest a structural dimerization among like subunits, at least at the level of the Ni2+-binding site."

Neuron. 1998; 21: 123-136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar) and (ii) PE-dependent binding of DOC2 (2Orita S. Naito A. Sakaguchi G. Maeda M. Igarashi H. Sasaki T. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16081-16084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). DOC2, like Munc13-1, has been implicated in the regulation of exocytosis (1Betz A.

Komuro R. Takai Y. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7 (suppl.): 2603Google Scholar). DOC2 co-purifies with markers for secretory vesicles and, to a lesser extent, plasma membrane (5Verhage M. de Vries K.J. Roshol H. Burbach J.P. Gispen W.H. Sudhof T.C. Neuron. 1997; 18: 453-461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Overexpression of DOC2 in PC12 cells enhances regulated exocytosis, whereas depletion of DOC2 has the opposite effect (2Orita S. Naito A. Sakaguchi G. Maeda M. Igarashi H. Sasaki T. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16081-16084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence suggest that DOC2 interacts with other components of the regulated secretory pathwayin vitro, notably Munc18 (5Verhage M. de Vries K.J. Roshol H. Burbach J.P. Gispen W.H. Sudhof T.C. Neuron. 1997; 18: 453-461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) and Munc13-1 (2Orita S. Naito A. Sakaguchi G. Maeda M. Igarashi H. Sasaki T. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16081-16084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Although the PE-triggered translocation of Munc13-1 is reminiscent of PKC-activation (6Tanaka C. Nishizuka Y. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1994; 17: 551-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar) and may reflect an activation mechanism of Munc13-1, the functional consequences of translocation are unclear. On the other hand, the interaction of DOC2 and Munc13-1 may have a functional role in neurotransmitter release. Injection of peptides representing the Munc13-1-binding domain of DOC2 into motor neurons (7Mochida S. Orita S. Sakaguchi G. Sasaki T. Takai Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11418-11422Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) decreases neurotransmitter release. These indirect data suggest that Munc13-1 binding to DOC2 is important in the regulation of secretion. In this study we use GFP reporter constructs to monitor the sub-cellular distribution of DOC2β in HEK293 cells. This same model system was used to great effect to demonstrate that Munc13 isoforms can translocate to the plasma membrane upon PE stimulation (1Betz A. Ashery U. Rickmann M. Augustin I. Neher E. Sudhof T.C. Rettig J. Brose N. Neuron. 1998; 21: 123-136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). For the present study it offers the additional advantage that neither Munc13 nor DOC2 is endogenously expressed. Our work demonstrates directly that Munc13-1 and DOC2 interact transiently in vivo upon PE stimulation, leading to a massive, Munc13-1-dependent redistribution of DOC2. This PE-stimulated interaction may represent the molecular basis of PE-dependent, Munc13-1-mediated enhancement of neurotransmitter release and provides the first direct observation of the interaction of two presynaptic proteins in vivo. A reverse transcription-PCR strategy was used to amplify a cDNA encoding the open reading frame of mouse brain DOC2β. Briefly, total RNA was prepared from adult mouse brain following standard procedures (8Chomczinski P. Saatchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159PubMed Google Scholar), followed by mRNA enrichment using Poly(A) Quik columns (Stratagene, Cambridge, UK) according to the manufacturer's instructions. One μg of this RNA was used as template in a first-strand cDNA synthesis directed from an anchored deoxyoligo d(T) (5′-TTCTAGAATTCAGCGGCCGC(T)30N1N2) primer, using Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.). The resultant cDNA was diluted and used in a polymerase chain reaction between forward (5′-CTGCCTGCATGACCCTCCGGC) and reverse (5′-TCAGTCGCTGAGYACAGCCCCTGGG) deoxyoligonucleotides using Expand polymerase mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Sequence analysis revealed that the cloned cDNA had a sequence identical to that previously published for mouse cerebellum DOC2β cDNA (9Kojima T. Fukuda M. Aruga J. Mikoshiba K. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1996; 120: 671-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) (GenBank accession no. D85037). The cDNA constructs used in this work are represented in Fig. 1. The PCR product(s) were ligated to a T/A vector (pCR2.1, Invitrogen, Groningen, Netherlands) and completely sequenced on both strands (OSWEL DNA Services, Southampton, UK). Rat VAMP/synaptobrevin II was isolated from rat whole brain first-strand cDNA prepared in a similar manner. Full-length cDNA was amplified using forward (5′-ATGTCGGCTACCGCTGCCACCGTCCCGCCTG) and reverse (5′-AGTGCTGAAGTAAACGATGATGATGATGAGGATGATGG) deoxyoligonucleotides. PCR products were ligated directly to pcDNA3.1-NT-GFP-TOPO according to the manufacturer's instruction (Invitrogen), and sequenced as before (GenBank accession no. M24105) (10Elferlink L.A. Trimble W.S. Scheller R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11061-11064Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Complementary DNA encoding full-length DOC2β was subcloned from pCR2.1 into pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen) as a KpnI-BamHI restriction fragment. A dilution of this plasmid was used as template in a PCR as described above to generate anEcoRI-BamHI restriction fragment suitable for in-frame ligation to pEGFPN1 (CLONTECH, Cambridge, UK). A further PCR was used to generate DOC2β C2, which was ligated to pEGFPN1. MID-GFP was generated by PCR and ligation to pcDNA3.1-NT-GFP-TOPO (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. All constructs were sequenced as before. Construction of Munc13-1 in pcDNA3.1 and pEGFPN1 was described previously (1Betz A. Ashery U. Rickmann M. Augustin I. Neher E. Sudhof T.C. Rettig J. Brose N. Neuron. 1998; 21: 123-136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Expression in HEK293 cells was achieved by transfection using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. HEK293 cells, between passages 8 and 25, were cultured on glass coverslips at 37 °C in 95% (v/v) air, 5% (v/v) CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 5 mm glutamine, and 1% (v/v) penicillin/streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.), and transfected as described above. All experiments were performed 24–48 h after transfection. The medium was refreshed immediately prior to the experiments, and PMA or 4α-PMA (Alexis, Nottingham, UK) was added to a final concentration of 100 nm when required. Where appropriate, PKC inhibitor bisindolylmaleimide I (Calbiochem; final concentration of 100 nm) or chelerythrine (Alexis; final concentration 25 μm) was added 10–15 min before PMA stimulation and maintained throughout the experiment. Cells were incubated for 5–30 min at 37 °C or otherwise and washed twice with PBS supplemented with Ca2+ and Mg2+ (PBS-CM) before fixation for 5 min with ice-cold 4% (w/v) buffered paraformaldehyde. After further washing in PBS-CM, coverslips were mounted using Aquamount (BDH). Fixed fluorescent cells were imaged using a Leica TCS NT Confocal System (Leica Lasertechnik GmbH, Heidelberg, Germany) with a PL APO 63x/1.32–0.6 oil immersion lens, also made by Leica. Images were processed using Paintshop Pro v5.0 (Digital Workshop, Banbury, UK). HEK293 cells transfected with cDNA encoding Munc13-1-EGFP alone showed a uniform cytoplasmic distribution of fluorescence with nuclear sparing, as described previously (Fig.2 a). Reverse transcription-PCR and immunoblot analysis failed to detect endogenous DOC2α or DOC2β mRNA or protein in HEK293 cells (not shown). Cells co-transfected with cDNAs encoding DOC2β and Munc13-1-EGFP (see below) showed a fluorescence distribution similar to that described for Munc13-1-EGFP alone. HEK293 cells transfected with DOC2-EGFP alone showed the fluorescence to be distributed throughout the cell cytoplasm in a punctate pattern with nuclear sparing, reminiscent of a vesicular distribution (Fig. 2 c). Cells transfected with cDNA encoding a fluorescent fusion protein containing only the N-terminal 38 amino acids of DOC2β fused to GFP (MID-GFP) showed a diffuse cytoplasmic distribution of fluorescence with sparing of organelles and the nucleus (Fig.3 a). In contrast, a cDNA encoding a fusion between both C2 domains of DOC2β and EGFP (C2-EGFP) showed a punctate vesicular distribution of fluorescence similar to the full-length protein (Fig. 3 c).Figure 3Confocal optical sections (0.5 μm thickness) showing EGFP fluorescence in cells transiently expressing DOC2β and Munc13-1 EGFP fusion proteins before and after PMA stimulation. The constructs transfected into each cell are represented below each photograph. a, MID-GFP fusion protein shows a diffuse, cytoplasmic distribution with nuclear sparing before PE application. This distribution alters dramatically after treatment as shown inpanel b. C2-EGFP domains are shown before PMA stimulation (c) and after PE treatment (d). The C2 domains of DOC2β are required for the association of the fusion protein with intracellular membranes but are not sufficient for Munc13-1 interaction and translocation. e and f, the DOC2-Munc13-1 interaction was further confirmed as specific by substituting VAMP-GFP for DOC2-EGFP in the translocation assay. The VAMP-GFP fluorescence was seen spread throughout the cell in a punctate distribution both before and after PE application. These data indicate that the DOC2 translocation is directed by an interaction with Munc13-1 induced by Munc13-1-PE interaction. The intracellular localization of DOC2 protein is determined by the C2 domains of DOC2 associating with intracellular membranes, which are directed in their localization by PE-bound Munc13-1. Scale bars = 25 μm. See Fig. 1legend for a key describing domain shading.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The intracellular distribution of DOC2-EGFP fluorescence altered dramatically when the cells were stimulated with PMA. Previously, it had been demonstrated that Munc13-1-EGFP translocates in a C1 domain-mediated manner from a cytoplasmic localization to the plasma membrane in HEK293 cells upon PE stimulation, an observation repeated here (Fig. 2 b) (1Betz A. Ashery U. Rickmann M. Augustin I. Neher E. Sudhof T.C. Rettig J. Brose N. Neuron. 1998; 21: 123-136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). PE stimulation of cells transfected with DOC2-EGFP alone had no effect upon the intracellular localization of the fluorescence (Fig. 2, c and d). The localization of DOC2-EGFP remained unaltered in unstimulated cells in the presence or absence of Munc13-1. However, after PE stimulation the distribution of DOC2-EGFP altered dramatically from the vesicular-like pattern to a plasma membrane distribution, but only in cells co-expressing Munc13-1 (Fig. 2, e–f). In individual fields of view, most fluorescent cells (>90%; n> 50 fields of ∼20 cells) showed DOC2-EGFP:Munc13-1 co-translocation after PE stimulation. Those cells that did not show the effect were presumably transfected with only DOC2β or were sub-viable at the time of stimulation. A specific DOC2-Munc13-1 interaction was confirmed by repeating the Munc13-1 co-transfection experiments with the MID-GFP fusion protein and the complementary C2 domain fluorescent fusion protein C2-EGFP. The localization of the fluorescent MID domain fusion protein changed upon PE stimulation from a diffuse cytoplasmic to a peripheral membrane distribution (Fig. 3, a–b). No such translocation was observed using only the C2 domain fusion (Fig. 3,c and d). These effects were observed only in the presence of wild type Munc13-1 and after PE stimulation. The specificity of the DOC2β-Munc13-1 interaction was further confirmed by substituting VAMP-GFP for DOC2-EGFP in the translocation assays. Although cells transfected with VAMP-GFP displayed a vesicular distribution, no translocation was observed in the presence or absence of PE in cells co-transfected with Munc13-1 (Fig. 3, eand f). All of the above experiments were repeated using the inactive PE 4α-PMA, and no stimulation-dependent translocation was observed using any construct combination (e.g. Fig.4, a and b). Pretreatment of the cells for 15 min before the addition of PMA and during PMA treatment with the broad spectrum PKC inhibitor bisindolylmaleimide I (which does not block the PE-induced Munc13-1 translocation (1Betz A. Ashery U. Rickmann M. Augustin I. Neher E. Sudhof T.C. Rettig J. Brose N. Neuron. 1998; 21: 123-136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar)) had no effect upon the previously observed translocations (Fig. 4, c and d). However, a similar pretreatment of the cells with the C1 domain-specific PKC inhibitor chelerythrine (which does block PE-induced Munc13-1 translocation (1Betz A. Ashery U. Rickmann M. Augustin I. Neher E. Sudhof T.C. Rettig J. Brose N. Neuron. 1998; 21: 123-136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar)) abolished the translocation effects for all construct combinations (Fig. 4, e andf). We have taken advantage of the absence of native Munc13-1 and DOC2β in HEK293 cells to perform a systematic dissection of the interaction between heterologously expressed GFP fusion proteins of DOC2β and Munc13-1. Although previous in vitro binding studies and peptide injection assays have suggested an interaction between these two proteins, our work demonstrates clearly a transient phorbol ester-stimulated interaction in vivo. Furthermore, our work shows that DOC2β is mobile, its localization being directly regulated by Munc13-1 and phorbol ester. The central role of Munc13-1 in mediating the DOC2β translocation is supported by the observations that (i) translocation of DOC2β occurs only when Munc13-1 is co-expressed with DOC2β; (ii) the translocation can be blocked by chelerythrine but not by bisindolylmaleimide I, as in the case of translocation of Munc13-1 (1Betz A. Ashery U. Rickmann M. Augustin I. Neher E. Sudhof T.C. Rettig J. Brose N. Neuron. 1998; 21: 123-136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar), but not of PKC (which is blocked by both agents); and (iii) translocation depends on the presence of the MID domain in DOC2β. Munc13-1 and DOC2β interact only after PE stimulation. We speculate that PE binding to the C1 domain of Munc13-1 triggers a conformational shift in Munc13-1, exposing the DOC-interacting domain. As the endogenous ligand in this pathway is likely to be diacylglycerol, activation of the phospholipase C pathway may be a key regulatory event. In some synapses, phospholipase C activation may lead to parallel activation of PKC, which may have additional effects on secretion (11Hilfiker S. Augustine G. J. Physiol. ( Lond. ). 1999; 515: 1Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 12Yawo H. J. Physiol. 1999; 515: 169-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 13Stevens C.F. Sullivan J.M.

The in vivo interaction between DOC2β and Munc13-1 reported here may represent the molecular basis of PE-dependent, PKC-independent, Munc13-1-mediated enhancement of neurotransmitter release.

We used a C3 fusion toxin (C2IN-C3) with high cell accessibility to study the kinetics of Rho inactivation by ADP-ribosylation. In primary cultures of rat astroglial cells and Chinese hamster ovary cells, C2IN-C3 induced the complete ADP-ribosylation of RhoA and concomitantly the disassembly of stress fibers within 3 h. Removal of C2IN-C3 from the medium caused the recovery of stress fibers and normal cell morphology within 4 h. The regeneration was preceded by the appearance of non-ADP-ribosylated RhoA. Recovery of cell morphology was blocked by the proteasome inhibitor lactacystin and by the translation inhibitors cycloheximide and puromycin, indicating that intracellular degradation of the C3 fusion toxin and the neosynthesis of Rho were required for reversal of cell morphology. Escherichia colicytotoxic necrotizing factor CNF1, which activates Rho by deamidation of Gln63, caused reconstitution of stress fibers and cell morphology in C2IN-C3-treated cells within 30–60 min. The effect of CNF1 was independent of RhoA neosynthesis and occurred in the presence of completely ADP-ribosylated RhoA. The data show three novel findings; 1) the cytopathic effects of ADP-ribosylation of Rho are rapidly reversed by neosynthesis of Rho, 2) CNF1-induced deamidation activates ADP-ribosylated Rho, and 3) inhibition of Rho activation but not inhibition of Rho-effector interaction is a major mechanism underlying inhibition of cellular functions of Rho by ADP-ribosylation.

Methods Enzymol. 1995; 256: 184-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Inasmuch as C3 exoenzyme appears to enter cells via nonspecific pinocytosis, its cell accessibility is poor (24Aktories K. Mohr C. Koch G. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1992; 175: 115-131PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, we constructed a C3 fusion toxin, which enters cells by using the binaryC. botulinum C2 toxin as a carrier (25Barth H. Hofmann F. Olenik C. Just I. Aktories K. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 1364-1369Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The actin-ADP-ribosylating C2 toxin consists of the ∼80-kDa binding component (C2II) and the 49-kDa enzymatic component (C2I) (26Ohishi I. Iwasaki M. Sakaguchi G. Infect. Immun. 1980; 30: 668-673Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Aktories K. Wegner A. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 1385-1387Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 28Aktories K. Bärmann M. Ohishi I. Tsuyama S. Jakobs K.H. Habermann E. Nature. 1986; 322: 390-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). Both C2 components are separate proteins which assemble at the cell surface after C2II has bound to an unknown receptor. The C3 fusion toxin (C2IN-C3) contains the N-terminal domain (amino acid residues 1- 225) of C2I (C2IN), which has no enzyme activity but binds to the C2II component and is sufficient for translocation of C2I into the cytosol. In contrast to C3 exoenzyme, the C2IN-C3 fusion toxin enters cells readily and causes the depolymerization of stress fibers at low toxin concentration within a few hours (25Barth H. Hofmann F. Olenik C. Just I. Aktories K. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 1364-1369Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, C2IN-C3 allows the study of the kinetics of the cellular intoxication process in more detail. Here we report that the cytopathic effects of the C2IN-C3 fusion toxin are rapidly reversed after removal of the toxin. Reversal of the C3-induced alterations of the cytoskeleton is caused by rapid degradation of the toxin and by resynthesis of Rho. Moreover, we show that the Rho-deamidating toxin CNF1 reverses the effects of C2IN-C3 most likely by reactivating ADP-ribosylated Rho. The data provide new insights into the mechanism of the action of C3 and indicate that ADP-ribosylated Rho is still able to interact with effectors and to activate their targets. Cell culture medium was purchased from Biochrom (Berlin, Germany), fetal calf serum from PAN Systems (Aidenbach, Germany) and Life Technologies, Inc. (Heidelberg, Germany), and cell culture materials from Falcon (Heidelberg, Germany). Lab-Tec chamber slides were from Permanox (Nunc, Germany). The C2II binding component from the C. botulinum C2 toxin was purified and activated with trypsin as described (26Ohishi I. Iwasaki M. Sakaguchi G. Infect. Immun. 1980; 30: 668-673Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Ohishi I. Infect. Immun. 1987; 55: 1461-1465Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The C2IN-C3 fusion toxin (25Barth H. Hofmann F. Olenik C. Just I. Aktories K. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 1364-1369Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and CNF1 (16Schmidt G. Sehr P. Wilm M. Selzer J. Mann M. Aktories K. Nature. 1997; 387: 725-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar) were purified as recombinant GST1 fusion proteins as described. The pGEX-LBC construct was kindly donated by Denniz Toksoz, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA (30Zheng Y. Olson M.F. Hall A. Cerione R.A. Toksoz D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9031-9034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). LBC was purified as a recombinant GST fusion protein. 2′-(3′)-O-(N-Methylanthraniloyl)guanosine 5′-diphosphate (mant-GDP) was prepared as described (31Hiratsuka T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 742: 496-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). The pGEX2T vector (included in the GST Gene Fusion System) and glutathione-Sepharose 4B were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (Uppsala, Sweden). Anti-RhoA-antibody and horseradish peroxidase-coupled anti-mouse antibody were from Santa Cruz (Heidelberg, Germany). Rhodamine-phalloidin, puromycin and cycloheximide were purchased from Sigma (Deisenhofen, Germany). [32P]NAD (30 Ci/mmol) was from NEN Life Science Products (Bad Homburg, Germany). Nylon membrane for RNA blotting, the DIG in vitro transcription kit, and the DIG DNA labeling and detection kit were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals (Mannheim, Germany). Lactacystin was from Calbiochem (Bad Soden, Germany). CHO-K1 cells were cultivated in tissue culture flasks at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in Ham's F-12/Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (1:1) containing 5% heat-inactivated (30 min, 56 °C) fetal calf serum, 2 mml-glutamate, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells were routinely trypsinized and reseeded twice a week. Primary cultures of rat astroglial cells were set up as described previously (32Keller M. Jackisch R. Seregi A. Hertting G. Neurochem. Int. 1985; 7: 655-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 33Hildebrand B. Olenik C. Uhl A. Meyer D.K. Brain Res. 1997; 759: 285-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). For cytotoxicity and regeneration assays, subconfluent cells (about 105 to 5 × 105 cells/cm2) in 3-cm plates containing coverslips or cells growing on Lab-Tec chamber slides were treated for different times with 200 ng/ml activated C2II together with 100 ng/ml C2IN-C3. CNF1 was used in a final concentration of 300 ng/ml medium. For regeneration assays cells were treated with the respective toxin for 3 h; then the cells were washed 5 times with prewarmed medium, new medium without any toxin was added, and the cells were incubated at 37 °C. For fluorescence staining of F-actin, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde containing 0.1% Triton X-100 for 30 min. Thereafter, cells were briefly washed and incubated for 30 min with rhodamine-phalloidin (600 ng/ml). Cells were treated with the respective toxins as indicated. After incubation they were washed with cold PBS, harvested in 400 μl of cold lysis buffer (2 mmMgCl2, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 80 μg/ml benzamidine in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) and sonicated. Aliquots (100 μg of protein) of the lysate were incubated with [32P]NAD and 50 ng of C2IN-C3 fusion toxin at 37 °C for 30 min, Laemmli buffer was added, the samples were heated for 3 min at 95 °C and run on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). [32P]ADP-ribosylated proteins were detected by autoradiography with a PhosphorImager from Molecular Dynamics (Krefeld, Germany). SDS-PAGE was performed according to Laemmli (34Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206983) Google Scholar). For immunoblot analysis, the proteins were transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was blocked for 30 min with 5% nonfat dry milk in PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 (PBS-T) and the proteins were probed with anti-RhoA antibody (mouse, 1:2000 in PBS-T). After washing with PBS-T, the blot was incubated for 1 h with an anti-mouse antibody coupled to horseradish peroxidase (1:2000 in PBS-T). The membrane was washed again, and proteins were visualized using the ECL system according to the manufacturer's instructions. Total RNA was extracted by the guanidine hydrochloride method (35Cheley S. Anderson R. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 137: 15-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Seven-μg aliquots were separated by denaturing gel electrophoresis (1.25% formaldehyde agarose gels; running buffer was 20 mm MOPS, 8 mm NaAc, and 1 mm EDTA) and electroblotted onto a nylon membrane. The following nonradioactive DIG filter hybridization and detection of RhoA mRNA was performed as described previously (36Olenik C. Barth H. Just I. Aktories K. Meyer D.K. Mol. Brain Res. 1997; 52: 263-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 37Höltke H.-J. Kessler C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 5843-5851Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). All measurements were done on a LS50B spectrofluorometer from Perkin Elmer at 37 °C. First RhoA was loaded with the fluorescent nucleotide mant-GDP by incubating 0.5 μm GTPase with 2 μm mant-GDP in buffer C (10 mm triethanolamine, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2) for 1 h. Thereafter, the exchange of Rho-bound mant-GDP for GTP was initiated by adding 100 μm GTP and 0–20 μm LBC. The exchange of Rho-bound fluorescent mant-GDP for GTP was monitored by the decrease in fluorescence intensity upon the release of mant-GDP from RhoA. Exciting of the mant-fluorophor was at 357 nm; emission was measured at 444 nm. The rate constant for the release of mant-GDP was determined by fitting the experimental curve with a single exponential decay using SigmaPlot (Jandel Scientific). In primary cultures of rat astrocytes, C2IN-C3 fusion toxin caused changes in cell shape and destruction of stress fibers. These effects started 40 min after addition of the toxin and were maximal after about 2 h (Fig.1 A). By 40–60 min after addition of C3 fusion toxin to intact cells, radioactive [32P]ADP-ribosylation of Rho was no longer observed in the cell lysate, indicating the complete modification of cellular Rho (Fig. 1 B). The ADP-ribosylation of RhoA was confirmed by anti-RhoA immunoblot analysis (Fig. 1 C). Twenty minutes after addition of the toxin, a fast moving (unmodified Rho) and a slower moving RhoA band (ADP-ribosylated Rho) were detected by immunoblotting. After 40 min, only the ADP-ribosylated RhoA was observed. To test whether the effects of the fusion toxin were reversible, astroglial cells were incubated with the toxin for 3 h. Thereafter, the cells were extensively washed to remove extracellular toxin. Stress fibers reappeared 6 h after removal of the toxin, and the recovery was complete after 24 h (Fig.2 A). Reorganization of stress fibers was accompanied by the reappearance of the polygonal cell morphology (Fig. 2 A). Removal of the toxin rapidly changed the proportion of ADP-ribosylated and non-modified Rho (Fig.2 B). Four hours after removal of the toxin, i.e.when the cells started to rebuild their stress fibers, a small amount of Rho was [32P]ADP-ribosylated. Its level increased with the duration of toxin withdrawal (Fig. 2 B). Accordingly, 4 h after removal of the toxin, non-ADP-ribosylated RhoA was detected by anti-RhoA immunoblotting and 24 h after toxin withdrawal only non-ADP-ribosylated RhoA was detected (Fig.2 C). Reversal of the C3 effects was not cell type-specific. In CHO cells or HeLa cells, the C3 fusion toxin disassembled stress fibers within 3 h. Removal of the toxin resulted in the reorganization of stress fibers, adhesion to dish matrix, and restoration of cell morphology. The recovery started 2–3 h after addition of fresh medium (data not shown). Reversal of the cytopathic effects seemed to be specific for the fusion toxin. When CHO cells were treated with 10 μg/ml wild-typeC. limosum C3 exoenzyme for 24 h to induce the “C3 specific” morphology, cells did not recover after removal of the toxin by medium exchange. Because the cytopathic effects disappeared rapidly after removal of C2IN-C3 from the medium, we studied whether the toxin was intracellularly degraded by proteases. When CHO cells were treated for 3 h with the fusion toxin and subsequently incubated for 16 h in fresh medium in the presence of the proteosome inhibitor lactacystin, cells did not regain their original morphology. In lysates of these cells, Rho was not radioactively labeled by ADP-ribosylation with [32P]NAD and C3 (Fig.3 A, lane 5). As expected, only a slowly migrating RhoA band was detected by immunoblotting, indicating the presence of Rho ADP-ribosylated in intact cells (Fig. 3 B, lane 5). Thus, lactacystin prolonged the cellular effects of the C3 fusion toxin. First, we tested whether recovery of non-ADP-ribosylated Rho was due to cleavage of the ADP-ribose moiety from Rho by a cellular hydrolase activity. CHO cells were treated with the C3 fusion toxin for 2 h and then incubated for 1 h in fresh medium without toxin. Cell lysates were prepared and incubated for 0, 3, and 6 h at 37 °C. Thereafter, Rho protein was analyzed by immunoblotting (Fig.4). Even after incubation of the lysates for 6 h at 37 °C (Fig. 4, lanes 3 and6), a significant proteolysis of RhoA was not detected. Furthermore, in lysates of cells that had been treated with C3 fusion toxin (lanes 4–6), the slowly migrating band of ADP-ribosylated RhoA remained stable, while a rapidly migrating RhoA band did not appear. Taking these results together, we were not able to detect hydrolysis of the ADP-ribosylated RhoA in the lysates. To test whether the reappearance of non-ADP-ribosylated RhoA after toxin withdrawal was due to newly synthesized protein, we blocked protein synthesis with cycloheximide or puromycin. Three hours after addition of the toxin, endogenous Rho was completely ADP-ribosylated (no [32P]ADP-ribosylation, Fig.5 B, lane 2) and only the slowly moving ADP-ribosylated RhoA band was detected in the immunoblot (Fig. 5 C, lane 2). When cycloheximide or puromycin was present after toxin withdrawal, regeneration of stress fibers (Fig. 5 A) and [32P]ADP-ribosylation of Rho was not observed (Fig.5 B, lanes 5 and 7). Moreover, the immunoblot did not show unmodified RhoA (Fig.5 C, lanes 5 and 7). All these data suggested that protein neosynthesis, not hydrolysis of ADP-ribosylated RhoA, was responsible for the reappearance of non-ADP-ribosylated RhoA. Northern blot analysis of total RNA extracts from CHO cells was used to investigate whether the rapid neosynthesis was initiated by an increase in RhoA mRNA. Neither addition of the C3 toxin (added for 3 h) nor its removal had any effect on the amount of RhoA mRNA (Fig.6). Apparently, neosynthesis of RhoA protein is due to ongoing protein synthesis. Because a small amount of newly synthesized RhoA protein appeared to induce the complete reassembly of actin filaments and reconstitution of the cellular morphology, we tested whether this process could be enhanced by incubation of C3-treated cells with the E. coli cytotoxic necrotizing factor, CNF1, which activates Rho by deamidation (16Schmidt G. Sehr P. Wilm M. Selzer J. Mann M. Aktories K. Nature. 1997; 387: 725-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar, 18Flatau G. Lemichez E. Gauthier M. Chardin P. Paris S. Fiorentini C. Boquet P. Nature. 1997; 387: 729-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). Therefore, actin stress fibers of CHO cells were destroyed by treatment (3 h) with the C3 fusion toxin (Fig. 7). The cells were subsequently incubated for 2 h with CNF1 in the presence of the C3 fusion toxin. Surprisingly, the cells started to form actin stress fibers as early as 60 min after CNF1 addition. The CNF1-induced rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton was accompanied by a total reconstitution of “normal” cell morphology within about 2 h. CNF1 completely prevented the C3-induced breakdown of actin filaments when CNF was added 3 h prior to C2IN-C3 fusion toxin (data not shown). When both toxins were added together at the same time, a weak C3-induced disassembly of actin filaments was observed after 60 min. This effect was completely reversed by CNF1 within another 60 min. The same rapid recovery of actin stress fibers was observed when NIH 3T3 fibroblasts were exposed to the various toxin combinations (data not shown). Next we analyzed the extent of ADP-ribosylation of Rho after CNF1 treatment. As shown in Fig. 8, in C3-treated cells RhoA remained completely ADP-ribosylated even after treatment of cells with CNF1 for 3 h (lane 4) (note that at this time point all cells exhibited complete recovery of the actin cytoskeleton). Additionally, when C2IN-C3 and CNF1 were added together, RhoA was ADP-ribosylated (lane 5). After 3 h, the cells showed no disassembly of stress fibers or C3-typical cytopathic effects on cell morphology. Finally, preincubation of cells with CNF1 for 3 h did not prevent C3-induced ADP-ribosylation. Similar results were obtained with NIH 3T3 cells (data not shown). The effects of CNF1 on the C3-induced alteration of cellular morphology occurred very rapidly, suggesting that the recovery of cell morphology was not caused by neosynthesis of Rho. However, to exclude that CNF1 accelerated the expression of Rho and to rule out that a very small amount of neosynthesized RhoA was sufficient for rebuilding of the actin cytoskeleton, we tested the toxin in combination with inhibitors of protein synthesis. Therefore, CHO cells were treated for 16 h with the C3 fusion toxin in the presence of cycloheximide. Subsequently, the cells were incubated with CNF1 for another 2 h in the presence of cycloheximide. Thereafter, cells were lysed and Rho was [32P]ADP-ribosylated by C3. Fig.9 A shows that no radioactive labeling of Rho was detected in lysates of cells pretreated with C3 or C3 plus CNF1. In contrast, pretreatment of cells with CNF1 did not inhibit the radiolabeling of Rho. These findings indicated that Rho from cells treated with fusion toxin and additionally with CNF1 was completely ADP-ribosylated. The anti-RhoA immunoblot (Fig.9 B) confirmed the ADP-ribosylation of RhoA and showed an additional shift of Rho due to CNF1-induced modification. Taken together, these results demonstrated that, despite the ADP-ribosylation of cellular Rho, CNF1 treatment causes complete and rapid reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton, even under conditions excluding the de novo synthesis of Rho. The results described above (e.g. activation of ADP-ribosylated Rho by CNF1) suggested that inhibition of Rho function by ADP-ribosylation is not caused by a blockade of the interaction of the GTPase with its effectors but rather by inhibition of its activation. To test this hypothesis, we studied the nucleotide release of ADP-ribosylated Rho previously loaded with mant-GDP in the presence of the Rho-specific nucleotide exchange factor LBC (30Zheng Y. Olson M.F. Hall A. Cerione R.A. Toksoz D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9031-9034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.10 A, the release of mant-GDP of control RhoA was stimulated by GST-LBC by about 13-fold, whereas LBC stimulated the release of the nucleotide from ADP-ribosylated Rho only by about 1.5-fold. This dramatic reduction in the activation of GDP release was observed over a broad concentration range of LBC (Fig.10 B). To study kinetics and functional consequences of Rho ADP-ribosylation in intact cells, we used the C2IN-C3 fusion toxin that uses the cell delivery system of the binary C. botulinum C2 toxin to enter target cells (25Barth H. Hofmann F. Olenik C. Just I. Aktories K. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 1364-1369Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). C2IN-C3 caused rapid disassembly of stress fibers and major changes in morphology in cultured rat astroglial cells and in CHO cells. The effects started within 40 min and were maximal about 2 h after toxin addition. As reported for the effects of the C3 exoenzyme (38Wiegers W. Just I. Müller H. Hellwig A. Traub P. Aktories K. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 54: 237-245PubMed Google Scholar, 39Paterson H.F. Self A.J. Garrett M.D. Just I. Aktories K. Hall A. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 1001-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar), these changes in morphology were preceded by a complete ADP-ribosylation of Rho. Surprisingly, the cells recovered within a few hours after removal of the toxin from the medium. Apparently, this recovery of the normal cell morphology depended on the occurrence of non-ADP-ribosylated RhoA. Concomitantly with the start of the rebuilding of stress fibers, a small amount of non-ADP-ribosylated RhoA was detected. Twenty-four hours after toxin removal, when reconstitution of the actin cytoskeleton and regeneration of cellular morphology were complete, only non-ADP-ribosylated Rho was observed. Subsequently, we tested whether reappearance of non-ADP-ribosylated Rho result from cleavage of the ADP-ribose moiety of modified Rho or from de novo synthesis of the GTPase. Cleavage of arginine-linked ADP-ribose is catalyzed by specific ADP-ribosylarginine hydrolases (40Takada T. Iida K. Moss J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17837-17843Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but ADP-ribosylasparagine hydrolase has not been identified so far. Moreover, we were not able to obtain any evidence for a cleavage of the ADP-ribose moiety attached to Rho by hydrolase activity. In contrast, the translation inhibitors cycloheximide and puromycin blocked de novo synthesis of RhoA and prevented the recovery of cell morphology. This finding strongly suggested that Rho neosynthesis is crucial for reversal of cell morphology. Since Northern blot analysis did not show an increase in RhoA mRNA after treatment with C2IN-C3 or after its removal, the rapid de novo synthesis of RhoA was not due to enhanced transcription. Therefore, we conclude that the constitutive biosynthesis of RhoA is sufficient to restore RhoA functions. Morphological changes were reversed when neosynthesis had provided at approximately 10% of the normal cellular content of Rho but when ADP-ribosylated Rho was still present. Thus, our findings do not support a dominant negative role of ADP-ribosylated Rho as suggested from microinjection studies (39Paterson H.F. Self A.J. Garrett M.D. Just I. Aktories K. Hall A. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 1001-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). This discrepancy may be explained by the high protein concentration usually used in such microinjection studies. In addition to rapid neosynthesis of RhoA, the recovery of normal cell morphology depended on the intracellular degradation of the toxin. Since addition of the proteasome inhibitor lactacystin prevented the recovery of the normal cell morphology, the C2IN-C3 fusion toxin was probably degraded by the proteosomal pathway (41Fenteany G. Schreiber S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8545-8548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). Similarly, toxin degradation by the proteosomal pathway has been recently described for a fusion protein of anthrax toxin, which is related to C2 toxin (42Goletz T.J. Klimpel K.R. Arora N. Leppla S.H. Keith J.M. Berzofsky J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12059-12064Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In the presence of lactacystin only ADP-ribosylated Rho was detected, indicating that the ADP-ribosylating activity persisted in the cytosol and immediately modified the neosynthesized Rho. The data suggested that a continuous delivery of the toxin into the cytosol occurs in the presence of extracellular C2IN-C3. Consequently, the ADP-ribosylation of RhoA persists as long as the toxin is supplied. In contrast, cells treated with the C. limosum C3 exoenzyme did not recover within 24 h after removal of the toxin (data not shown). This difference in cell recovery may be explained by the different structures of the toxins and/or by the different modes and extent of cellular uptake. In addition, E. coli cytotoxic necrotizing factor CNF1 reversed the morphological changes induced by C2IN-C3. CNF1 catalyzes the deamidation of glutamine at position 63 of Rho (16Schmidt G. Sehr P. Wilm M. Selzer J. Mann M. Aktories K. Nature. 1997; 387: 725-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar, 18Flatau G. Lemichez E. Gauthier M. Chardin P. Paris S. Fiorentini C. Boquet P. Nature. 1997; 387: 729-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). This modification blocks the GTPase activity of Rho and renders Rho constitutively active. The recovery of the flat cell morphology after removal of C2IN-C3 occurred much more rapidly in the presence than in the absence of CNF1. Surprisingly, recovery of the cell morphology and formation of stress fibers were induced by CNF1 even in the presence of C2IN-C3. Moreover analysis of Rho from cells treated in parallel with both toxins (e.g. CNF1 and C2IN-C3) revealed complete ADP-ribosylation of the GTPase. Thus, CNF1 was able to restore stress fiber formation despite the complete ADP-ribosylation of Rho. Recently, it has been described in Hep-2 cells that CNF1 prevented the cytopathic effects of C3B, a C3 fusion toxin consisting of C3 and the binding/translocation domain of diphtheria toxin (43Fiorentini C. Donelli G. Matarrese P. Fabbri A. Paradisi S. Boquet P. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 3936-3944Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this report it was suggested that CNF1 prevents ADP-ribosylation of Rho by C3 (43Fiorentini C. Donelli G. Matarrese P. Fabbri A. Paradisi S. Boquet P. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 3936-3944Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, our data indicate that ADP-ribosylation and deamidation of Rho by CNF1 and C3, respectively, occur in parallel, but the functional consequences induced by CNF1 appear to be dominant. In addition to Rho, CNF1 was shown to deamidate and to activate Rac and Cdc42 (17Lerm M. Selzer J. Hoffmeyer A. Rapp U.R. Aktories K. Schmidt G. Infect. Immun. 1998; 67: 496-503Crossref Google Scholar). Also these GTPases are involved in organization of the actin cytoskeleton. However, there is no evidence that Rac and Cdc42 can substitute for Rho as regards the formation of stress fibers (2Ridley A.J. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 389-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3822) Google Scholar, 3Ridley A.J. Paterson H.F. Johnston C.L. Diekmann D. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 401-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3071) Google Scholar). Therefore, our findings suggest that CNF1 induced the formation of an activated form of ADP-ribosylated Rho, which still interacted with cellular targets and was capable of activating effectors necessary for the formation of stress fibers and focal adhesions. Moreover, this observation provides new insights into the molecular mechanism underlying the inactivation of Rho by ADP-ribosylation. It was shown that ADP-ribosylation has no major effects on nucleotide binding as well as hydrolysis of bound GTP. GAP-stimulated GTPase activity is not affected either (39Paterson H.F. Self A.J. Garrett M.D. Just I. Aktories K. Hall A. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 1001-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar, 44Sehr P. Joseph G. Genth H. Just I. Pick E. Aktories K. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5296-5304Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Because the ADP-ribosylation at Asn41 occurs near the effector region of Rho, it has been suggested that the ADP-ribosylation blocks the interaction of Rho with its effectors (22Sekine A. Fujiwara M. Narumiya S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8602-8605Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, this hypothesis was not supported by findings that ADP-ribosylated Rho interacts with effectors like protein kinase N (44Sehr P. Joseph G. Genth H. Just I. Pick E. Aktories K. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5296-5304Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) or phosphatidyl-4-phosphate 5-kinase (45Ren X.-D. Bokoch G.M. Traynor-Kaplan A. Jenkins G.H. Anderson R.A. Schwartz M.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 435-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Based on the observation that ADP-ribosylated Rho binds with even higher affinity to phosphatidyl-4-phosphate 5-kinase than the native RhoA, it was speculated that the effector activation step but not the binding is blocked by ADP-ribosylation (45Ren X.-D. Bokoch G.M. Traynor-Kaplan A. Jenkins G.H. Anderson R.A. Schwartz M.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 435-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Our findings suggested that rather the activation step of Rho is crucially altered by ADP-ribosylation. This hypothesis was supported by the in vitro studies with recombinant ADP-ribosylated RhoA, showing that the stimulation of the GDP release from Rho by the guanine nucleotide exchange factor LBC was inhibited after ADP-ribosylation. Because the inactivation mechanism of ADP-ribosylated Rho by GTP hydrolysis is fully functional, a blocked or diminished activation of Rho will shift the GTPase to its inactive state (Fig. 11). Thus, after inhibition of the GTPase activity of Rho by CNF1, ADP-ribosylated Rho becomes active because the equilibrium between the inactive and active state is again shifted to the active state (Fig. 11).

https://openalex.org/W2067988372,"Site-specifically modified oligodeoxynucleotides were used to investigate the mutagenic properties of a major cooked food mutagen-derived DNA adduct,N-(deoxyguanosin-8-yl)-2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4, 5-b]pyridine (dG-C8-PhIP). dG-C8-PhIP-modified oligodeoxynucleotides were prepared by reacting an oligodeoxynucleotide containing a single dG (5′-TCCTCCTX GCCTCTC, where X = C, A, G, or T) with N-acetoxy-PhIP. The unmodified and dG-C8-PhIP-modified oligomers were inserted into single-stranded phagemid vectors. These single-stranded vectors were transfected into simian kidney (COS-7) cells. The progeny plasmid obtained was used to transform Escherichia coli DH10B. When dC was at the 5′-flanking position to dG-C8-PhIP, preferential incorporation of dCMP, the correct base, was observed opposite the dG-C8-PhIP. Targeted G → T transversions were detected, along with lesser amounts of G → A transitions and G → C transversions. No mutations were detected for the unmodified vector. The influence of sequence context on the dG-C8-PhIP mutation frequency and spectrum was also explored. When the dC 5′-flanking base was replaced by dT, dA, or dG, the mutational spectra were similar to that observed with dC-flanking base. Higher mutational frequencies (28–30%) were observed when dC or dG was 5′ to dG-C8-PhIP. A lower mutational frequency (13%) was observed when dA was at the 5′ to the lesion. Single-base deletions were detected only when dG or dT flanked the adduct. We conclude that dG-C8-PhIP is mutagenic, generating primarily G → T transversions in mammalian cells. The mutational frequency and specificity of dG-C8-PhIP vary depending on the neighboring sequence context. Site-specifically modified oligodeoxynucleotides were used to investigate the mutagenic properties of a major cooked food mutagen-derived DNA adduct,N-(deoxyguanosin-8-yl)-2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4, 5-b]pyridine (dG-C8-PhIP). dG-C8-PhIP-modified oligodeoxynucleotides were prepared by reacting an oligodeoxynucleotide containing a single dG (5′-TCCTCCTX GCCTCTC, where X = C, A, G, or T) with N-acetoxy-PhIP. The unmodified and dG-C8-PhIP-modified oligomers were inserted into single-stranded phagemid vectors. These single-stranded vectors were transfected into simian kidney (COS-7) cells. The progeny plasmid obtained was used to transform Escherichia coli DH10B. When dC was at the 5′-flanking position to dG-C8-PhIP, preferential incorporation of dCMP, the correct base, was observed opposite the dG-C8-PhIP. Targeted G → T transversions were detected, along with lesser amounts of G → A transitions and G → C transversions. No mutations were detected for the unmodified vector. The influence of sequence context on the dG-C8-PhIP mutation frequency and spectrum was also explored. When the dC 5′-flanking base was replaced by dT, dA, or dG, the mutational spectra were similar to that observed with dC-flanking base. Higher mutational frequencies (28–30%) were observed when dC or dG was 5′ to dG-C8-PhIP. A lower mutational frequency (13%) was observed when dA was at the 5′ to the lesion. Single-base deletions were detected only when dG or dT flanked the adduct. We conclude that dG-C8-PhIP is mutagenic, generating primarily G → T transversions in mammalian cells. The mutational frequency and specificity of dG-C8-PhIP vary depending on the neighboring sequence context. 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine 2′-deoxyguanosine N-(deoxyguanosin-8-yl)-PhIP high performance liquid chromatography single strand Cooked meat contains potent mutagens and carcinogens, many of which are heterocyclic amines (1Sugimura T.

Similar mutational spectra were detected in the lacI gene of the Big Blue mouse treated with PhIP (41Okonogi H. Ushijima T. Zhang X.B. Heddle J.A. Suzuki T. Sofuni T. Felton J.S. Tucker J.D.

In this study, oligodeoxynucleotides containing a single dG-C8-PhIP were prepared post-synthetically and inserted into a single-stranded shuttle vector to minimize adduct repair (43Moriya M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1122-1126Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). This vector was used to establish the mutagenic specificity and frequency of dG-C8-PhIP in simian kidney (COS-7) cells. In addition, to explore the effect of neighboring bases, mutational specificities were determined with dG-C8-PhIP embedded in different sequence contexts. Our results show that the dG-C8-PhIP-DNA adduct has significant mutagenic potential, generating primarily G → T transversions in mammalian cells. The mutational spectra and frequencies vary depending on the neighboring sequence context. [γ-32P]ATP (specific activity, >6000 Ci/mmol) was obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech.Escherichia coli DH10B was purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. COS-7 cell line was obtained from the tissue culture facility at SUNY at Stony Brook. EcoRI restriction endonuclease (100 units/μl) and T4 DNA ligase (400 units/μl) were obtained from New England Bio Labs. N-Hydroxy-PhIP was synthesized by an established method (36Lin D. Kaderlik K.R.

The reaction mixture was evaporated to dryness and subjected to HPLC. A Supelcosil LC-18S column (0.46 × 25 cm, Supelco, Inc.) was eluted with 50 mm ammonium formate, pH 3.5, containing 20% acetonitrile over 3 min, 20–50% over 5 min, 50% over 5 min, and subsequently 50–100% over 7 min at a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min. A Waters 990 HPLC instrument equipped with a photodiode array detector was used for isolation of dG-C8-PhIP. Unmodified 15-mer oligodeoxynucleotides (5′-TCCTCCTX GCCTCTC, whereX = C, A, T, or G) were prepared by solid-state synthesis, using an automated DNA synthesizer (44Takeshita M. Chang C.-N. Johnson F. Will S. Grollman A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10171-10179Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A 15-mer oligodeoxynucleotide (150 μg) was incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with 50 μl of N-acetoxy-PhIP dissolved in 500 μl of 10 mm potassium citrate buffer, pH 6.8, concentrated on Centricon 3, and evaporated to dryness. The dG-C8-PhIP-modified oligomer was isolated from the unmodified oligomer on a Waters reverse-phase μBondapak C18 column (0.39 × 30 cm), using a linear gradient of 0.05 m triethylammonium acetate, pH 7.0, containing 10–20% or 10–30% acetonitrile with an elution time of 60 min and a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min, as described elsewhere (45Shibutani S. Gentles R. Johnson F. Grollman A.P. Carcinogenesis. 1991; 12: 813-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). These oligomers were further purified by electrophoresis on 20% polyacrylamide gel in the presence of 7 m urea (35 × 42 × 0.04 cm) (46Shibutani S. Bodepudi V. Johnson F. Grollman A.P. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4615-4621Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The oligomers recovered from polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis were again subjected to HPLC to remove urea. A dG-C8-PhIP-modified 15-mer oligodeoxynucleotide (2.0 μg) was digested with nuclease P1 (2 units) and alkaline phosphatase (3 units) as described previously (46Shibutani S. Bodepudi V. Johnson F. Grollman A.P. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4615-4621Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Methanol extract obtained from the digested sample was evaporated to dryness and analyzed by HPLC using a Supelcosil LC-18S (0.46 × 25 cm, Supelco, Inc.). The column was eluted with distilled water over 3 min, with 50 mm ammonium acetate, pH 4.5, containing 0–10% acetonitrile over 15 min, and subsequently 10–100% over 15 min at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min. SV40-transformed simian kidney cell lines COS-7 and a single-strand (ss) shuttle vector, pMS2 that confers neomycin (NeoR) and ampicillin resistance (43Moriya M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1122-1126Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar) were used to establish the mutagenic specificity of dG-C8-PhIP. Construction of a circular ss DNA containing a single dG-C8-PhIP followed procedures established previously in this laboratory (43Moriya M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1122-1126Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). pMS2 DNA was annealed to a 61-mer and then digested withEcoRV to create a 15-mer gap (Fig.2). An unmodified, dG-C8-PhIP-modified 15-mer was ligated to the gapped vector. The ligation mixture was incubated for 2 h with T4 DNA polymerase (1 unit/pmol of DNA) to digest the hybridized 61-mer and then treated with EcoRV and SalI to cleave residual ss pMS2. The reaction mixture was extracted twice with phenol/chloroform (1:1 v/v) and twice with chloroform. Following ethanol precipitation, the DNA was dissolved in distilled water. A portion of the ligation mixture and known amounts of ss pMS2 were subjected to electrophoresis on a 0.9% agarose gel to separate closed circular and linear ss DNA. DNA was transferred to a nylon membrane and hybridized to a 32P-labeled S13 probe complementary to DNA containing the 15-mer insert. The absolute amount of closed circular ss DNA was established by comparing the radioactivity in the sample with that in known amounts of ss DNA. COS-7 cells were transfected with ss DNA (100 fmol) over 18 h using Lipofectin (47Felgner P.L. Gadek T.R. Holm M. Roman R. Chan H.W. Wenz M. Northrop J.P. Ringold G.M. Danielsen M. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Progeny plasmids were recovered by the method described by Hirt (48Hirt B. J. Mol. Biol. 1967; 26: 365-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (3339) Google Scholar), treated with S1 nuclease to digest input ss DNA, and used to transform E. coli DH10B. Transformants were analyzed for mutations by oligodeoxynucleotide hybridization (49Inouye S. Inouye M. Narang S. Synthesis and Applications of DNA and RNA.

Probes L13 and R13 were used to select phagemids containing the correct insert. Transformants that failed to react with L13 and R13 were omitted from the analysis. When L13/R13-positive transformants failed to hybridize to the probes designed to detect events targeted to the lesion site, double-strand DNA was prepared and subjected to dideoxynucleotide sequencing analysis (51Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52250) Google Scholar). A 15-mer oligodeoxynucleotide (5′-TCCTCCTX GCCTCTC, where X = C, A, T, or G) containing a single dG was reacted with a preparation ofN-acetoxy-PhIP. HPLC systems were used to isolate the dG-C8-PhIP-modified 15-mer. For example, when dG was positioned at the 5′-flanking base (N), two modified 15-mers containing a single dG-C8-PhIP were isolated at 42.8 min (5′-GPhIPG-) and 46.4 min (5′-GGPhIP-) from the corresponding oligomer (t R = 26.3 min), as shown in Fig.3 A. Following treatment of32P-labeled dG-C8-PhIP-modified oligomers by venom phosphodiesterase, the position modified by dG-C8-PhIP can be determined by blockage of the enzyme digestion (52Johnson F.

The first and second products represent oligomer containing 5′-GPhIPG- and 5′-GGPhIP-, respectively. The yield of dG-C8-PhIP-modified 15-mer was 1.0–4.5%. The dG-C8-PhIP-modified oligomers have UV absorbance at 300–420 nm. The UV maximum was 368 nm (Fig. 3 B), similar to that of dG-C8-PhIP (data not shown). The modified oligomer was further purified by HPLC and gel electrophoresis. The migration of 32P-labeled dG-C8-PhIP-modified 15-mers was slower than that of the unmodified oligomer (data not shown). When the dG-C8-PhIP-modified 15-mer (5′-TCCTCCTCGPhIPCCTCTC) was digested enzymatically (46Shibutani S. Bodepudi V. Johnson F. Grollman A.P. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4615-4621Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) and subjected to HPLC, dG-C8-PhIP was detected (Fig.4). The molar ratio of dC and dT (9.1:5.0) obtained was consistent with the theoretical value (dC:dT = 9:5).Figure 4Enzymatic digestion of dG-C8-PhIP-modified 15-mer. A, a standard mixture of dC, dG, dT, dA, and dG-C8-PhIP was passed through a Supelcosil LC-18S column. The column was eluted with distilled water over 3 min with 50 mmammonium acetate, pH 4.5, containing 0–10% acetonitrile over 15 min and subsequently 10–100% over 15 min at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” B, 2 μg of dG-C8-PhIP-modified 15-mer (5′-TCCTCCTCGPhIPCCTCTC) was digested with nuclease P1 and alkaline phosphatase.

When a part of the ligation mixture was cleaved with BanI and HaeIII restriction enzymes and labeled with 32P, a 40-mer product was detected on 12% denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig.5). The migration of 40-mers containing a dG-C8-PhIP was slower than that of the unmodified oligomer, as similarly observed for the dG-C8-PhIP-modified 15-mers. The final concentration of ss DNA vector was quantified by Southern blot hybridization. The S13 probe was hybridized to the ligation site of the ss vector (Fig. 2). Using a β-phosphorimager, the net product of the closed circular DNA of each constructs was estimated by comparison with variable amount of pMS2 DNA standards. The concentration of the closed circular vector sample was 5.8–15 ng/μl for the unmodified oligomer and 6.7–18 ng/μl for the dG-C8-PhIP-modified oligomers, respectively. The vector modified with dG-C8-PhIP was transfected into simian kidney (COS-7) cells. Progeny phagemid was used to transform E. coli DH10B. Transformants were analyzed for mutations by oligodeoxynucleotide hybridization and by dideoxynucleotide sequencing analysis. When C was positioned 5′ to dG-C8-PhIP, dG-C8-PhIP promoted preferential incorporation of dCMP (72.5%), the correct base, opposite the lesion (TableI).

The influence of sequence context on the mutational specificity and frequency of dG-C8-PhIP was explored. When the 5′-flanking base was dT, targeted G → T base substitutions (14.4%) were detected, accompanied by small number of G → A (4.3%) and G → C (1.4%) mutations (TableI). In addition, a single-base deletion was detected. The mutational specificity was similar, and the mutational frequency was slightly less under these conditions than when dC was 5′ to dG-C8-PhIP. When dA was the 5′-flanking base, the mutational frequency was 2.2 times less than that observed when dC flanked dG-C8-PhIP (Table I). Preferential G → T mutations (11.4%) were observed along with G → A transitions (1.3%). No G → C mutations were detected. Oligomers containing a dG-C8-PhIP lesion positioned at codon 60 or 61 of the noncoding strand of the human c-Ha-ras 1 gene was inserted into single-stranded vectors. When dG 5′ site of contiguous dG (5′-GPhIPG-) was modified by PhIP, small amounts of G → T mutations (7.8%) were detected (TableII). In contrast, when the 3′ dG (5′-GGPhIP -) was modified by PhIP, the mutational frequency increased 3.0 times (Table II). Targeted mutations representing G → T transversions (17.4%) were preferentially observed, accompanied by lesser amounts of G → A transitions (6.0%) and G → C transversions (3.4%).

Our mutational spectra are consistent with those observed in the dhfr gene (37Carothers A.M. Yuan W. Hingerty B.E. Broyde S. Grunberger D. Snyderwine E.G. Chem. Res.

Carcinogenesis. 1995; 16: 713-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) in mammalian cells exposed to PhIP as well as in the lacI gene of the Big Blue mouse treated with PhIP (41Okonogi H. Ushijima T. Zhang X.B. Heddle J.A. Suzuki T. Sofuni T. Felton J.S. Tucker J.D. Sugimura T. Nagao M. Carcinogenesis. 1997; 18: 745-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and in the APCgene in rat colon tumors induced by PhIP (42Kakiuchi H. Watanabe M. Ushijima T. Toyota M. Imai K. Weisburger J.H. Sugimura T. Nagao M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 910-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Thus, mutations occurring at GC pairs in cells of animals treated by PhIP are most likely due to the major DNA adduct, dG-C8-PhIP. The mutational potential of dG-C8-PhIP also was determined by replacing the 5′-flanking base to the lesion (Fig.6). Higher mutational frequencies (28–30%) were observed when dG or dC was at the 5′-flanking position to the dG-C8-PhIP, whereas a lower frequency (13%) was observed when dA was 5′ to the lesion. G → T mutations predominate in all sequence contexts, along with lesser amounts of G → A mutations. Only when A was the 5′-flanking base, the frequency of G → A mutations (1.3%) was 2–4.6 times less than that of other flanking bases (2.6–6.0%), and no G → C mutations were observed. Thus, the 5′ neighboring base influences the mutational frequency and specificity of dG-C8-PhIP. We also determined the mutational properties of dG-C8-PhIP having the same 5′-flanking base but a different 3′-flanking base (5′-TGPhIP C- and 5′-TGPhIP G-). In both cases, G → T mutations predominated, along with a small number of G → C mutations and single-base deletions. However, no G → A transitions were produced when G 3′-flanking base was used. In addition, the mutational frequency of dG-C8-PhIP having C 3′ position was two times higher than that having G 3′ position. This indicates that the 3′-flanking sequence context also affects the mutational properties of dG-C8-PhIP. A single-base frameshift (deletion) was observed in dGdC sequences, but not in dAdT sequences (37Carothers A.M. Yuan W. Hingerty B.E. Broyde S. Grunberger D. Snyderwine E.G. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1994; 7: 209-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 39Yadollahi-Farsani M. Gooderham N.J. Davies D.S. Boobis A.R.

Single-base deletions were frequently detected on the contiguous dGdC sequences of theAPC gene (5′-GGGA-) in rat colon tumors induced by PhIP (42Kakiuchi H. Watanabe M. Ushijima T. Toyota M. Imai K. Weisburger J.H. Sugimura T. Nagao M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 910-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) and in lacI gene (5′-GCGGC-) in colon of the Big Blue mouse treated with PhIP (41Okonogi H. Ushijima T. Zhang X.B. Heddle J.A. Suzuki T. Sofuni T. Felton J.S. Tucker J.D. Sugimura T. Nagao M. Carcinogenesis. 1997; 18: 745-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). These contiguous dGdC sequences were recognized as mutation hot spots for PhIP (41Okonogi H. Ushijima T. Zhang X.B. Heddle J.A. Suzuki T. Sofuni T. Felton J.S. Tucker J.D. Sugimura T. Nagao M. Carcinogenesis. 1997; 18: 745-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In our in vivo studies using 5′-CGPhIPC- or 5′-AGPhIPC- sequence, no deletions were observed. However, when G was at the 5′-flanking base (5′-GGPhIPC-), significant amounts of single-base deletions were detected (Fig. 6). In addition, when T flanked 5′ to the dG-C8-PhIP (5′-TGPhIPC- or 5′-TGPhIPG-), a single-base deletion also was observed. Thus, the formation of single-base deletions may be influenced by the neighboring sequence context of dG-C8-PhIP. We have proposed a general frameshift deletion mechanism for chemical carcinogens, including dG-C8-AAF (53Shibutani S. Grollman A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11703-11710Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Formation of single-base deletion induced by dG-C8-PhIP is consistent with this in vitro model. During DNA synthesis catalyzed by DNA polymerases on a dG-C8-PhIP-modified template, dCMP was preferentially incorporated opposite the lesion. 2S. Shibutani, unpublished results. dCMP inserted opposite dG-C8-PhIP could pair with dG 5′ to the lesion, forming single-base deletions (Fig. 7,left panel). When dAMP is inserted opposite the lesion, dAMP could pair with dT 5′ to the lesion, forming single-base deletion (Fig.7, right panel). The same deletion mechanism may be involved in the formation of single-base deletions observed in theApc (42Kakiuchi H. Watanabe M. Ushijima T. Toyota M. Imai K. Weisburger J.H. Sugimura T. Nagao M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 910-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) and Iac I (41Okonogi H. Ushijima T. Zhang X.B. Heddle J.A. Suzuki T. Sofuni T. Felton J.S. Tucker J.D.

The mutagenic specificity ofN-(deoxyguanosin-8-yl)-2-aminofluorene (dG-C8-AF) has been established in vivo using a similar sequence context (5′-CGAFC-) for dG-C8-PhIP (54Shibutani S. Suzuki N. Grollman A.P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 12034-12041Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). dCMP was incorporated preferentially opposite dG-C8-AF. A small number of targeted incorporation of dAMP (2.0%) and dTMP (1.0%) was also observed. This mutational spectrum is similar to that observed with dG-C8-PhIP. Structural studies show that dG-C8-AF can adopt interconverting anti and syn alignments to pair with an anti-dCMP and an anti-dAMP, respectively (55Mao B. Hingerty B.E. Broyde S. Patel D.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 95-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 56Mao B. Hingerty B.E. Broyde S. Patel D.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 81-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Based on computational study of the lowest energy structure, dG-C8-PhIP resides in the B-DNA minor groove and adopts a syn conformation to pair with an anti-dAMP (37Carothers A.M. Yuan W. Hingerty B.E. Broyde S. Grunberger D. Snyderwine E.G. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1994; 7: 209-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Thus, dG-C8-PhIP generally resembles dG-C8-AF (57Norman D. Abuaf P. Hingerty B.E. Live D. Grunberger D. Broyde S. Patel D.J. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 7462-7476Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). However, the mutational frequency of dG-C8-PhIP (27.5%) was nine times higher than that observed in a similar sequence with dG-C8-AF. The nature of structure binding to the dG-C8 position may influence the mutational frequency. We conclude from this study that dG-C8-PhIP, a major PhIP-induced DNA adduct, is mutagenic lesion in mammalian cells. The mutagenic frequency varies depending on the neighboring sequence context to the lesion. This lesion may be involved in the development of human cancers including colon and breast cancers. We thank R. Rieger and M. C. Torres for synthesizing the unmodified oligodeoxynucleotides used in this study."
https://openalex.org/W1589010402,"The temptation to change lanes on a motorway may be prompted by an illusion. Switching lanes while driving along a busy road can be a risky manoeuvre. It is often instigated on the driver's judgement that the cars in the next lane are moving faster than those in the driver's own lane. But faulty intuition1,2,3 may cause people to overestimate the speed of vehicles in the next lane, believing that they are moving faster even when both lanes have the same average speed. We suggest that this illusion occurs because more time is generally spent being overtaken (passed) by other vehicles than is spent in overtaking them. Knowing that this effect is illusory might encourage drivers to resist small temptations to change lanes."
https://openalex.org/W2052339915,"Human narcolepsy, a chronic disorder that occurs in about 1 in 3000 individuals, is characterized by (1) excessive daytime sleepiness, (2) brief episodes of muscle weakness triggered by emotions (cataplexy), and (3) abnormalities of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep (2Bassetti C. Aldrich M.S Neurol. Clin. 1996; 14: 545-571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The disorder has a genetic basis: most affected persons carry the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) HLA-DQB1*0602, and first-degree relatives of narcoleptics have a 40-fold increased risk of developing narcolepsy (4Guilleminault C. Mignot E. Grumet F.C Lancet. 1989; 2: 1376-1379Abstract PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). However, most persons with HLA-DQB1*0602 do not develop narcolepsy, the concordance rate in identical twins is low, and narcolepsy does not cosegregate with HLA-DQB1*0602 in some multiplex families. Thus, one or more additional genes as well as environmental factors appear to be involved in the pathogenesis of narcolepsy. In the August 6 issue of Cell, 6Lin L. Faraco J. Li R. Kadotani H. Rogers W. Lin X. Qiu X. de Jong P.J. Nishino S. Mignot E Cell. 1999; 98: 365-376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2081) Google Scholar report that canine narcolepsy, a disorder with close phenotypic similarity to human narcolepsy, is caused by a mutation of the hypocretin receptor 2 gene (Hcrtr2). Hypocretins, also called orexins, are recently identified neuropeptides with homology to secretin. Within the central nervous system, cell bodies containing hypocretins are present exclusively in the tuberal region of the hypothalamus; their projections are widely distributed in the brain (9Peyron C. Tighe D.K. van den Pol A.N. de Lecea L. Heller H.C. Sutcliffe J.G. Kilduff T.S J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 9996-10015Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In dogs, narcolepsy is a fully penetrant disorder with autosomal recessive transmission. To identify the genetic defect (canarc-1) associated with canine narcolepsy, Lin and associates (1999) used positional cloning techniques based on earlier findings of a tightly linked immunoglobulin-like marker (7Mignot E. Wang C. Rattazzi C. Gaiser C. Lovett M. Guilleminault C. Dement W.C. Grumet F.C Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1991; 88: 3475-3478Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). After building a genomic bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) library from the DNA of a Doberman pinscher heterozygous for canarc-1, they used chromosome walking techniques to almost entirely physically clone a region of canine chromosome 12 that has substantial homology with a portion of human chromosome 6. Backcross breeding that produced a narcolepsy/immunoglobulin-like recombinant animal and analysis of other canine narcoleptic families reduced the canine narcolepsy susceptibility region to an ∼800 kb segment that contained only one previously identified gene, Hcrtr2. BAC clones containing this region showed restriction fragment length polymorphisms, and sequencing analysis of reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction products indicated a 116 bp deletion in the transcripts of narcoleptic animals, corresponding to a loss of the fourth exon from the Hcrtr2 cDNA. The researchers identified a 226 bp short interspersed nucleotide element (SINE) that was inserted upstream of the 3′ splice site of the fourth encoded exon. This finding suggested that the basis for the loss of exon 4 is a 5′ displacement of the branchpoint consensus sequence, which will significantly decrease splicing efficiency for exon 4. This SINE insertion was present in 17 narcoleptic Dobermans, absent in control dogs, and absent in Labrador and Dachshund narcoleptics. Similar analysis of cDNA from narcoleptic Labradors showed a 123 bp deletion of exon 6 and a G to A transition in the 5′ splice junction consensus sequence. Thus, the genetic abnormality in Doberman narcoleptics differs from that in Labrador narcoleptics, but both involve the same gene. The disrupted splicing of the Hcrtr2 mRNAs is predicted to lead to truncated receptor proteins, with consequent disruption of intracellular signaling mediated by the G proteins to which this receptor is linked. These findings represent a major advance in understanding the pathogenesis of canine narcolepsy, and probably human narcolepsy as well. A key feature of narcolepsy is the tendency to enter REM sleep directly from wakefulness. The REM sleep state is generated by neurons of the dorsolateral pons that are largely or entirely cholinergic. Monoaminergic neurons of the locus coeruleus (LC) and dorsal raphe (DR) inhibit the cholinergic generator neurons and prevent the expression of REM sleep; reduced or absent firing of DR and LC neurons allows REM sleep to be expressed. Hypothalamic neurons containing hypocretins project to brainstem areas critical for REM sleep, including the pedunculopontine and parabrachial nuclei, LC, and DR. Thus, hypocretins may well have modulatory effects on neurons involved in REM sleep expression, and Hcrtr2 mutations may lead to hyperexcitablity of REM sleep generator neurons, impairment of REM sleep inhibitory processes, or both. The neurological defect that causes human narcolepsy is unknown. Monoaminergic receptor changes seen in postmortem studies (1Aldrich M.S. Prokopowicz G. Hollingsworth Z. Penney J.B Sleep. 1994; 17: 598-608PubMed Google Scholar, 5Kish S.J. Mamelak M. Slimovitch C. Dixon L.M. Lewis A. Shannak K. DiStefano L. Chang L.J. Hornykiewicz O Neurology. 1992; 42: 229-234Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have not been confirmed by in vivo studies using positron emission tomography (PET) (11Rinne J.O. Hublin C. Partinen M. Ruottinen H. Ruotsalainen U. Nagren K. Lehikoinen P. Laihinen A Neurology. 1995; 45: 1735-1738Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and could be secondary to use of anticataplectic or stimulant medications. Canine narcolepsy is associated with monoaminergic and cholinergic receptor changes and with degeneration of neurons in the amygdala and diagonal band of Broca (8Nishino S. Mignot E Prog. Neurobiol. 1997; 52: 27-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar, 12Siegel J.M. Nienhuis R. Gulyani S. Ouyang S. Wu M.F. Mignot E. Switzer R.C. McMurry G. Cornford M J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 248-257PubMed Google Scholar). As the amygdala is involved with emotion, abnormalities in this area could contribute to cataplexy. Hypocretin neurons project to the amygdala and to the diagonal band of Broca, and hypocretin abnormalities could therefore contribute to changes in these regions. A major question to be answered is whether Hcrtr2 mutations occur in human narcolepsy; this question will likely be answered in the near future by analysis of the Hcrtr2 locus in cases of isolated and familial narcolepsy. Sleep researchers have suspected for years that an understanding of the basis of narcolepsy will lead to insights into the biology of sleep and wakefulness. The findings of Lin and coworkers (1999), which are likely to provide greater understanding of mechanisms underlying the control of REM sleep, support this belief. In addition, they may lead to insights concerning sleep deprivation. Rats subjected to total sleep deprivation increase their energy expenditure and food intake and develop defective thermal regulation (10Rechtschaffen A. Gilliland M.A. Bergmann B.M. Winter J.B Science. 1983; 221: 180-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Hypocretins, implicated in the control of feeding behavior, energy expenditure, and thermal regulation, may mediate or contribute to these findings. The logical next step in the undertaking by 8Nishino S. Mignot E Prog. Neurobiol. 1997; 52: 27-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar is to characterize the truncated protein and its biological effects. Future studies also will likely focus on the effects of Hcrtr2 agonists and antagonists on sleep and wakefulness, and the interactions, if any, between hypocretins and HLA-DQB1*0602 in humans. HLA class II molecules, such as HLA-DQB1*0602, are expressed in the nervous system and bind peptides; whether or not a particular peptide is bound depends on which antigen is expressed. If HLA-DQB1*0602 binds hypocretins, its presence in the nervous system could alter hypocretin activity and, in combination with aberrant receptor function, lead to narcolepsy. Assessment of Hcrtr2 density in the brains of canine and human narcoleptics may also be fruitful. Finally, a mouse model of narcolepsy based on mutations or deletion of the Hcrtr2 gene would greatly increase the availability and ease of use of this model for neuroscientists interested in sleep and sleep disorders. In the August 20 issue of Cell, 3Chemelli R.M. Willie J.T. Sinton C.M. Elmquist J.K. Scammell T. Lee C. Richardson J.A. Williams S.C. Xiong Y. Kisanuki Y. et al.Cell. 1999; 98: 437-451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2457) Google Scholar describe just such a model. They produced a prepro-orexin (prepro-hypocretin) knockout mouse that is characterized by abnormalities of REM sleep and periods of behavioral arrest that may represent cataplexy or sudden sleep episodes. While it remains to be determined whether this model duplicates all major aspects of human narcolepsy, including excessive sleepiness, the electrophysiological similarities are striking. Continued study of these mice should lead to significant advances in understanding the control and regulation of sleep and wakefulness."
https://openalex.org/W2051541338,"A mimotope-guided strategy for engineering antibodies directed against orphan targets or antigens that are difficult to purify was developed and used to humanize the murine MRK-16 monoclonal antibody (mAb). MRK-16 recognizes a conformational epitope of a 170-kDa membrane protein, termed P-glycoprotein (P-gp). Elevated expression of P-gp on tumor cells is associated with resistance to cytotoxic drugs, a major obstacle in chemotherapy. Murine MRK-16 was used to enrich and screen a phage-displayed peptide library to identify reactive mimotopes. One peptide, termed ALR1, was enriched to a greater extent than others and subsequently was expressed as a fusion protein with glutathione S-transferase. ALR1 fusion protein bound MRK-16 specifically and inhibited binding of MRK-16 to cells expressing elevated levels of P-gp. To humanize MRK-16, the murine complementarity determining regions were grafted onto homologous human heavy and light chain variable region frameworks. Framework residues that differed between the murine MRK-16 and the homologous human templates were analyzed and subsequently, five framework positions potentially important for maintaining the specificity and affinity of MRK-16 were identified. A combinatorial library consisting of 32 variants encoding all possible combinations of murine and human residues at the five differing framework positions was expressed in a phage system. In the absence of purified P-gp, ALR1 fusion protein was used as surrogate antigen to screen the antibody library to identify the framework combination that most preserved the binding activity of the mAb. On the basis of the initial screening against the mimotope four antibody variants were selected for further characterization. The binding affinity of these variants for the ALR1 fusion protein correlated with their binding to cells expressing elevated levels of P-gp. Thus, peptide mimotopes which can be identified for virtually any antibody including those that recognize conformational or carbohydrate epitopes, can serve as antigen templates for antibody engineering.

Framework residues that differed between the murine MRK-16 and the homologous human templates were analyzed and subsequently, five framework positions potentially important for maintaining the specificity and affinity of MRK-16 were identified. A combinatorial library consisting of 32 variants encoding all possible combinations of murine and human residues at the five differing framework positions was expressed in a phage system. In the absence of purified P-gp, ALR1 fusion protein was used as surrogate antigen to screen the antibody library to identify the framework combination that most preserved the binding activity of the mAb. On the basis of the initial screening against the mimotope four antibody variants were selected for further characterization. The binding affinity of these variants for the ALR1 fusion protein correlated with their binding to cells expressing elevated levels of P-gp. Thus, peptide mimotopes which can be identified for virtually any antibody including those that recognize conformational or carbohydrate epitopes, can serve as antigen templates for antibody engineering. monoclonal antibody antigen-binding fragment heavy light complementarity-determining region enzyme-linked immunsorbent assay P-glycoprotein glutathione S-transferase bovine serum albumin phosphate-buffered saline 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid The widespread success of murine hybridoma technology has resulted in the discovery of numerous well characterized monoclonal antibodies (mAbs)1 with unique specificities.

Although human mAbs have been discovered by these approaches there remains a need to fully exploit the potential clinical benefits of murine antibodies.As an alternative to discovering human mAbs, antibody engineering approaches have been developed to reduce the potential immunogenicity of murine mAbs. For example, chimeric antibodies consisting of the murine variable region fused to a human constant region have been constructed (14Morrison S.L. Johnson M.J. Herzenberg L.A. Oi V.T. Proc. Natl.

Antibody variants containing even fewer murine residues have been synthesized by grafting murine CDRs onto human variable region frameworks (17Jones P.T. Dear P.H. Foote J. Neuberger M.S. Winter G.

Unfortunately, chimeric antibodies may still display immunogenic properties in humans (20Hale G. Clark M.R. Marcus R. Winter G. Dyer M.J.S. Phillips J.M. Riechman L. Waldmann H.

A general and simple approach for reducing the immunogenicity of murine mAbs without diminishing their affinity would permit a greater number of the existing well characterized mAbs to be evaluated as therapeutics.The diminished affinity often observed with antibodies humanized by CDR grafting reflects the structural significance of certain framework residues. The relative importance of specific framework residues varies between different mAbs and consequently, identifying important residues and determining the optimal amino acid at those positions has proven difficult. Previously, we described an approach for the humanization of antibodies that uses phage expression of combinatorial antibody framework libraries and CDR grafting coupled with identification of the most active humanized variant by rapid screening methods (23Rosok M.J.

Phage expression of combinatorial framework libraries takes advantage of the efficiency of bacterial cloning systems and, when coupled with the appropriate assays, increases the likelihood of identifying fully active humanized variants. Examination of a wide range of framework structures reduces the requirement for structural modeling to predict precisely the framework residues critical for binding activity. Furthermore, the identification of fully active humanized variants from combinatorial libraries is straightforward, using screening methods that permit the affinities of numerous (>105) soluble Fabs to be distinguished rapidly (24Watkins J.D. Beuerlein G. Pecht G. McFadden P.R. Glaser S.M. Huse W.D. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 253: 37-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 26Wu H. Beuerlein G. Nie Y. Smith H. Lee B.A. Hensler M. Huse W.D.

However, therapeutic mAbs are often directed against cell surface antigens that are integral membrane proteins and therefore, the purification or expression of quantities of antigen sufficient to support screening of antibody libraries has been limiting in certain instances.Antibodies recognize a restricted portion of protein targets, termed the antigenic determinant or epitope, which can consist of peptide, protein, carbohydrate, or other chemical moieties. Regardless of the precise chemical nature of the epitope, peptides can often be used to mimic the structure of the antigenic determinant (27Geysen H.M. Rodda S.J. Mason T.J. Mol. Immunol. 1986; 23: 709-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). Moreover, the efficient synthesis of peptides or the display of random peptide libraries on the surface of phage (28Scott J.K. Smith G.P. Science. 1990; 249: 386-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (1884) Google Scholar) have greatly facilitated the identification of peptides reactive with a wide range of antibodies. For example, peptides reactive with mAbs that recognize linear (29Stephen C.W. Lane D.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 225: 577-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar), conformational (30Balass M.

Brinkmann U. Handel T. Pastan I. Gene ( Amst .). 1993; 128: 43-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) epitopes have been described. The ability of these mAb-reactive peptides to mimic the actual antigen epitope has been demonstrated by the use of the peptides as assay reagents and affinity matrices (32Hale G.

The ability of peptides to effectively mimic a portion of the structure of the antigen suggests that it may also be possible to use peptide mimotopes as templates for screening libraries of humanized variants to identify clones that retain the conformation of the binding site of the murine mAb. As such, a readily available supply of soluble antigen would be available to direct the humanization of mAbs, regardless of the nature or availability of the actual antigen.In the present study we wanted to determine if a mimotope could in fact be used to guide the successful humanization of an antibody. The murine mAb MRK-16, which is directed against an external domain of P-glycoprotein (41Hamada H. Tsuruo T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 7785-7789Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar), was selected as a model system. P-gp is an integral membrane protein that putatively spans the plasma membrane 12 times (42Gros P.

Science. 1983; 221: 1285-1288Crossref PubMed Scopus (875) Google Scholar), and acts as a drug efflux pump (reviewed in Ref. 46Gottesman M.M. Pastan I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 385-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (3549) Google Scholar). The expression of elevated levels of P-gp on tumor cells is associated with multidrug resistance, a primary cause of failure of chemotherapy. However, MRK-16 can block the efflux of certain chemotherapeutic drugsin vitro (41Hamada H. Tsuruo T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 7785-7789Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar) and treatment of athymic mice with MRK-16 inhibited the growth of drug-resistant human tumor cells in vivo (47Tsuruo T. Hamada H. Sato S. Heike Y. Jpn. J. Cancer Res. 1989; 80: 627-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Thus, MRK-16 may increase the benefits of certain chemotherapeutic agents. Although a humanized version of MRK-16 is preferred for human clinical studies, the difficulty in obtaining sufficient levels of soluble P-gp has hindered progress. In this study we describe the humanization of MRK-16 using a peptide mimotope as surrogate for the P-gp antigen for screening.DISCUSSIONThe premise of this study was that optimization of MRK-16 binding to a peptide mimotope would lead to optimization of MRK-16 binding toward the antigen, P-gp. The success of mimotope-guided humanization relies on the ability of peptides to mimic the epitope recognized by mAbs and consequently, peptide mimicry of the antigen must be reflected by the specificity of peptide binding to the target mAb. Several lines of evidence demonstrate the specificity of ALR1 binding to murine MRK-16. First, using immobilized murine MRK-16 mAb ALR1 was specifically enriched from a phage-expressed peptide library containing as many as 109 unique peptides. In addition, the binding of GST-ALR1 fusion peptide to MRK-16 was concentration-dependent and saturable while binding of unrelated GST-peptide fusions was undetectable. Finally, GST-ALR1 inhibited the binding of MRK-16 to fixed and live cells expressing elevated levels of P-gp. Collectively, these results are consistent with ALR1 binding at or near the CDR of MRK-16.Additional evidence that ALR1 mimicked the P-gp epitope closely was provided by the screening of the library of humanized variants. The primary amino acid sequences of the 32 combinatorial framework variants are highly homologous, differing by five or fewer amino acids. Nonetheless, the five framework positions examined in the combinatorial humanization library were selected based on their potential to affect the CDR structure and thus, the antigen binding of MRK-16. Despite the high degree of primary sequence similarity between the 32 variants, ALR1 binding to the humanized MRK-16 clones was variable. Differences in mimotope binding were observed both in the primary screening of random clones as well as in the titrations performed on select variants. Thus, similar to antigen-antibody interactions the affinity of the mimotope-antibody interaction was dependent on the framework structure of the variable region.Screening of 200 randomly selected clones identified seven distinct framework sequences that appeared to bind the mimotope with higher affinity. Of these, two variants, clones 4 and 12, were identified on multiple occasions providing further evidence that the enhanced signal observed during the initial screening of these particular clones was not an artifact. Sequence analysis of the 11 most active variants suggests that L chain residue 12 is a framework residue important for maintaining the affinity of humanized MRK-16. DNA sequencing of 20 randomly selected clones revealed a potential bias at L chain position 12 in the library synthesis with 15/20 (75%) clones expressing the human proline residue. However, DNA sequencing of the 12 clones selected on the basis of mimotope reactivity revealed that 10/11 (91%) clones expressed the murine serine residue. Because the method described herein does not use affinity selection/enrichment methods the results suggest that serine is favored over proline at L chain position 12. Preferences for either murine or human residues at the other four framework library positions were not observed.Several lines of evidence suggest that certain combinations of framework residues other than serine at L chain position 12 serve critical roles in preserving the binding activity of humanized MRK-16. First, the combinatorial library contains 16 distinct members that express a serine residue at L chain position 12 yet only six of these were identified based on binding assays. In addition, one of the active variants, clone 21, expressed proline at L chain position 12. Finally, the clone non-reactive with the mimotope expressed serine at L chain 12 and bound P-gp less effectively than other clones.Upon more thorough characterization one of the humanized versions of the murine mAb MRK-16 identified multiple times by screening with ALR1, clone 4, displayed higher affinity for P-gp than did the CDR-grafted construct, demonstrating that peptide mimicry of epitopes can be exploited to generate reagents that enable humanization of mAbs. Furthermore, although a very small number (n = 4) of variants from the combinatorial framework library were characterized fully by titration on both the mimotope and cells overexpressing P-gp there was good correlation between the relative affinities of these four variants for the mimotope as compared with P-gp.Humanization of MRK-16 used a combinatorial framework library that examined the contributions of five framework positions to the overall affinity of the antibody. However, it is often necessary to construct larger combinatorial libraries to characterize a greater number of potentially important framework residues. Larger libraries increase the likelihood of identifying fully active humanized variants because characterization of a greater number of framework positions diminishes the requirement for completely accurate structural modeling. However, larger libraries are screened more efficiently if soluble labeled antigen is available, which is often not the case. The ease with which mimotopes are identified and expressed as soluble GST fusion proteins enables the synthesis of large combinatorial antibody libraries by removing screening restrictions. Although mimotope screening may not be capable of identifying the optimal clone from large libraries it is envisioned that it can be used as an initial screen to permit the identification of a smaller number of variants for further characterization. Thus, large combinatorial libraries can be reduced to a few clones which can subsequently be screened by virtually any assay.The use of surrogate antigen for antibody humanization is of greatest utility if the mimotopes can be easily identified, are soluble, and can be readily purified and labeled for use as a screening reagent. In the present study, phage display peptide libraries were used for the rapid identification of a mimotope and subsequently, the peptide was expressed as a fusion protein with GST to enhance solubility and permit its straightforward purification and biotinylation. A priori, it was possible that the peptide identified by phage display would not be active when fused to GST, due to different interactions between the peptide and the pVIII or GST protein. However, to date we have successfully transferred four of five mimotopes identified from phage display libraries from pVIII to GST. The reasons for our success are unclear but may reflect the expression of the peptide libraries on the tip of pVIII, as opposed to other phage surface proteins. F-specific filamentous phage are composed of five different phage proteins, of which pVIII is the most abundant, with thousands of copies per phage. The pVIII protein forms a highly ordered, tightly packed coat while the remaining four phage proteins are present at small copy number on the ends of the phage particle (60Russel M. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 1607-1613Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The large number of pVIII protein copies per phage reduces the likelihood of peptides interacting among themselves. Moreover, the highly ordered packing of pVIII may reduce the number (diversity) of interactions between peptides and phage surface molecules and thus, increase the chance of successfully fusing the peptide to an unrelated protein, such as GST. The ease with which mimotopes identified by screening phage libraries of pVIII fusion peptides can be transferred to GST enables the surrogate antigen strategy to potentially be applied for the engineering of other mAbs.Previously, peptide mimotopes have been identified for mAbs that bind epitopes of diverse chemical nature and furthermore, mimotopes have been used as antigen substitutes in multiple applications including immunoassays, affinity matrices, elicit structural information, and as immunogens. All these applications provide evidence that peptides can in fact mimic epitope structure effectively and support the notion that mimotope-guided humanization is potentially applicable to a wide range of mAbs, even when the target antigen is unknown or difficult to isolate. Mimotope-guided humanization of MRK-16 is one example of antibody engineering in the absence of antigen. It is also possible that peptides can be used as reagents for in vitro affinity maturation of mAbs. However, amino acid substitutions in the CDRs that improve mAb affinity for the peptide may be directed toward portions of the peptide that are not structurally related to the antigen. Consequently, although the resulting mAb may bind peptide with higher affinity, binding to antigen may be unaltered or diminished. Therefore, for affinity maturation purposes it might be beneficial to optimize the mAb by screening against multiple mimotopes in parallel.
