Hence, there is an urgent need for a vaccine that prevents viral infection, transmission, and disease. Here, we present a two-component protein-based nanoparticle vaccine that displays multiple copies of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Immunization studies show that this vaccine induces potent neutralizing antibody responses in mice, rabbits, and cynomolgus macaques. The vaccine-induced immunity protects macaques against a high-dose challenge, resulting in strongly reduced viral infection and replication in the upper and lower airways. These nanoparticles are a promising vaccine candidate to curtail the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic."
https://openalex.org/W3130856386,"Neural stem cell numbers fall rapidly in the hippocampus of juvenile mice but stabilize during adulthood, ensuring lifelong hippocampal neurogenesis. We show that this stabilization of stem cell numbers in young adults is the result of coordinated changes in stem cell behavior. Although proliferating neural stem cells in juveniles differentiate rapidly, they increasingly return to a resting state of shallow quiescence and progress through additional self-renewing divisions in adulthood. Single-cell transcriptomics, modeling, and label retention analyses indicate that resting cells have a higher activation rate and greater contribution to neurogenesis than dormant cells, which have not left quiescence. These changes in stem cell behavior result from a progressive reduction in expression of the pro-activation protein ASCL1 because of increased post-translational degradation. These cellular mechanisms help reconcile current contradictory models of hippocampal neural stem cell (NSC) dynamics and may contribute to the different rates of decline of hippocampal neurogenesis in mammalian species, including humans."
https://openalex.org/W3127652313,"The COVID-19 pandemic has influenced activity behaviors worldwide. Given the accessibility of running as exercise, gaining information on running behaviors, motivations, and running-related injury (RRI) risk during the pandemic is warranted. The purpose of this study was to assess the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on running volume, behaviors, motives, and RRI changes from the year prior to the pandemic to the timeframe during social isolation restrictions. Runners of all abilities were recruited via social media to complete a custom Qualtrics survey. Demographics, running volume, behaviors, motivations, and injury status were assessed for the year prior to the pandemic, and during social isolation measures. Descriptive statistics and Student’s t-tests were used to assess changes in running outcomes during the pandemic. Logistic regressions were used to assess the influence of demographics on running behaviors and injury. Adjusted RRI risk ratios were calculated to determine the odds of sustaining an injury during the pandemic. Alpha was set to.05 for all analyses. A total of 1147 runners (66% females, median age: 35 years) across 15 countries (96% United States) completed the survey. Runners reported increased runs per week (Mean Difference with Standard Error [MD]: 0.30 [0.05], p &lt; .001), sustained runs (MD: 0.44 [0.05], p &lt; .001), mileage (MD: 0.87 [0.33], p = .01), and running times of day (MD: 0.11 [0.03], p &lt; .001) during the pandemic, yet reported less workouts (i.e. sprint intervals; MD: -0.33 [0.06], p &lt; .001), and less motives (MD [SE]: -0.41 [0.04], p &lt; .001). Behavior changes were influenced by running experience and age. There was 1.40 (CI: 1.18,1.61) times the RRI risk during the pandemic compared to prior to the social isolation period. The COVID-19 pandemic influenced runners’ behaviors with increased training volume, decreased intensity and motivation, and heightened injury risk. These results provide insights into how physical activity patterns were influenced by large-scale social isolation directives associated with the pandemic."
https://openalex.org/W3128776122,"Proprioception is essential for behavior and provides a sense of our body movements in physical space. Proprioceptor organs are thought to be only in the periphery. Whether the central nervous system can intrinsically sense its own movement remains unclear. Here we identify a segmental organ of proprioception in the adult zebrafish spinal cord, which is embedded by intraspinal mechanosensory neurons expressing Piezo2 channels. These cells are late-born, inhibitory, commissural neurons with unique molecular and physiological profiles reflecting a dual sensory and motor function. The central proprioceptive organ locally detects lateral body movements during locomotion and provides direct inhibitory feedback onto rhythm-generating interneurons responsible for the central motor program. This dynamically aligns central pattern generation with movement outcome for efficient locomotion. Our results demonstrate that a central proprioceptive organ monitors self-movement using hybrid neurons that merge sensory and motor entities into a unified network."
https://openalex.org/W3129800182,"Increasing evidence shows that the long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) is a major regulator and participates in the regulation of various physiological and pathological processes, such as cell proliferation, differentiation, metastasis, and apoptosis. Unlike mammals, however, the study of lncRNA in lower invertebrates is just beginning and the extent of lncRNA-mediate regulation remains unclear. Here, we for the first time identify an lncRNA, termed nucleotide oligomerization domain 1 (NOD1) antibacterial and antiviral-related lncRNA (NARL), as a key regulator for innate immunity in teleost fish. We found that NOD1 plays an important role in the antibacterial and antiviral process in fish and that the microRNA miR-217-5p inhibits NOD1 expression and thus weakens the NF-κB and the IRF3-driven signaling pathway. Furthermore, our results indicated that NARL functions as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) for miR-217-5p to regulate protein abundance of NOD1; thus, invading microorganisms are eliminated and immune responses are promoted.

Innate immunity is the first line of host defense and mainly composes of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) and their signal pathways. Nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptors (NLRs) are part of the cytosolic PRRs and play key roles in response to various bacterial infections (1Girardin S.E. Jéhanno M.

As the members of the NLR family, nucleotide oligomerization domain (NOD) 1 and NOD2 are important for epithelial and myeloid cell signaling in response to cytosolic bacterial peptidoglycans, muramyl dipeptide (MDP) and G-D-glutamyl-mesodiaminopimelic acid (iE-DAP) (2Caruso R.

NOD1 can monitor bacterial intrusions in cells and promotes the activation of the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways through RIP2 kinase (4Fritz T.

In lower vertebrates, increasing pieces of evidence show that NOD1 is widespread in fish and participates in the regulation of antibacterial immune response after pathogen infection (6Li J. Gao Y.

Recently, researchers have demonstrated that fish NOD1 plays an important role in recognizing lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and iE-DAP, as well as initiating downstream antiviral signaling pathways by identifying RNA virus (9Bi D.

Immunol. 2020; 204: 2216-2231Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Unlike mammals, TLR4, as the central protein that recognizes LPS, does not exist in most fish. Therefore, it was found that fish NOD1 can recognize LPS and iE-DAP and eventually causes an inflammatory response that could elucidate the resistance of fish against bacterial infections. Recently, a series of regulatory factors involved in the regulation of the NOD1 signaling pathway has been found. CENTB1 and E3 Ligase RNF34 regulate the NOD1 signaling pathway through directly regulating the expression of NOD1 (12Yamamoto-Furusho J.K. Barnich N. Xavier R. Hisamatsu T. Podolsky D.K.

Regulation of Nod1 by Hsp90 chaperone complex.FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 4513-4519Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar); it was also found that SGT1 can act as a positive regulator of the NOD1 signaling pathway (15da Silva Correia J. Miranda Y. Leonard N. Ulevitch R. SGT1 is essential for Nod1 activation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 6764-6769Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). In addition to protein regulatory factors, microRNA (miRNA) has also been found to play an important role in the NOD1 signaling pathway in recent years. For example, PPARγ-regulated miR-125a could target NOD1 and regulate NOD1-mediated angiogenesis (16Kang H. Park Y. Lee A. Seo H. Kim M.J. Choi J. Jo H.-N. Jeong H.-N. Cho J.G. Chang W. Negative regulation of NOD1 mediated angiogenesis by PPARγ-regulated miR-125a.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2017; 482: 28-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Since NOD1 is an important intracellular receptor that recognizes LPS in fish, the elucidation of the regulatory mechanism of the NOD1 signaling pathway in fish is even more important. Our laboratory had found for the first time that miR-144 and miR-217-5p can target and negatively regulate the expression of NOD1 to attenuate the NOD1-mediated inflammatory response in fish (17Chu Q. Bi D. Zheng W. Xu T. MicroRNA negatively regulates NF-κB-mediated immune responses by targeting NOD1 in the teleost fish Miichthys miiuy.Sci.

The long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) is defined as RNA with noncoding potential and larger than 200 nucleotides length (18Hu G. Cabrera A. Kono M. Mok S. Chaal B.K. Haase S. Engelberg K. Cheemadan S.

Landscape of transcription in human cells.Nature. 2012; 489: 101-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (3112) Google Scholar). An increasing number of studies have shown that lncRNA is a major regulator and participates in the regulation of cell proliferation, differentiation, metastasis, and apoptosis (20Esteller M. Non-coding RNAs in human disease.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2011; 12: 861-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (2942) Google Scholar, 21Mercer T.R. Dinger M.E. Mattick J.S. Long non-coding RNAs: Insights into functions.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2009; 10: 155-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (3891) Google Scholar). Recent studies also show that lncRNAs can play the role of competitive endogenous RNAs (ceRNA) by adsorbing miRNA, thus regulating the binding of miRNA and mRNA. Until now, the function of lncRNAs has only been widely studied in mouse and human, such as lncRNA LINC01133, MIAT, or UCA1, all can be used as ceRNA to competitively bind miRNA to regulate mRNA (22Yang X.-Z. Cheng T.-T. He Q.-J. Lei Z.-Y. Chi J. Tang Z. Liao Q.-X. Zhang H. Zeng L.-S. Cui S.-Z.

LncRNA-UCA1 exerts oncogenic functions in non-small cell lung cancer by targeting miR-193a-3p.Cancer Lett. 2016; 371: 99-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). However, the function mechanism of lncRNA in lower vertebrates is still poorly understood. Teleost is a representative population of lower vertebrates and an important part of early vertebrate evolution, so it is considered an excellent biological model in immunology research. The teleost fish not only has a very important significance in biological evolution and immunity but also its status in the aquatic industry is not to be underestimated. However, artificially cultivated fishes are extremely vulnerable to various pathogens, especially Gram-negative bacteria and RNA virus, such as Aeromonas hydrophila, Edwardsiella tarda, Vibrio harveyi, and Siniperca chuatsi rhabdovirus (SCRV) (25Luis A.L.I.

An essential role for NOD1 in host recognition of bacterial peptidoglycan containing diaminopimelic acid.Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 702-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (961) Google Scholar). The mechanism that induces fish disease and how to prevent and solve these fish diseases are problems that need to be discovered and solved urgently. LPS and iE-DAP are pathogenic components carried by various Gram-negative bacteria and can induce an inflammatory response in the host (27Hoang M. Potter J.A. Gysler S.M. Han C.S. Guller S. Norwitz E.R. Abrahams V.M. Human fetal membranes generate distinct cytokine profiles in response to bacterial toll-like receptor and Nod-like receptor agonists.Biol.

Immunol. 2017; 198: 3274-3282Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). At present, the pathogenic mechanism of Gram-negative bacteria and RNA virus has been relatively comprehensive in mammals. However, the research process of teleost fish is different from that of mammals and has great limitations and shortcomings as the slow development of research technology and difficulty in obtaining materials. In this study, we firstly identified a ceRNA regulatory loop involved in innate immune responses in teleost fish. Our previous work has revealed that miR-217-5p can negatively regulate NOD1 and suppress the antibacterial immune response in miiuy croaker (Miichthys miiuy) (17Chu Q. Bi D. Zheng W. Xu T. MicroRNA negatively regulates NF-κB-mediated immune responses by targeting NOD1 in the teleost fish Miichthys miiuy.Sci. China Life Sci. 2020; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11427-020-1777-yCrossref Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Herein, we further suggest that miR-217-5p can negatively regulate NOD1 and can suppress the antiviral response in miiuy croaker. Furthermore, we found that an lncRNA, named NARL, can act as a ceRNA for miR-217-5p to facilitate NOD1 expression, thus modulating innate immune responses. Our research not only contributes to the understanding of the ceRNA network mechanism in teleost fish but also provides a reference for the importance of lncRNA in the innate immune response in lower vertebrates. Increasing pieces of studies have shown that lncRNA can play a regulatory role as a spongy body adsorbing miRNA and interfere with the host’s immune signaling pathways through the sponge mechanism (29Fu T. Ji K. Jin L. Zhang J. Wu X. Ji X. Fan B. Jia Z. Wang A. Liu J. ASB16-AS1 up-regulated and phosphorylated TRIM37 to activate NF-κB pathway and promote proliferation, stemness, and cisplatin resistance of gastric cancer.J. Gastric. Cancer. 2020; 24: 45-59Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar). We treated miiuy croaker with LPS and SCRV to identify whereas lncRNAs are potentially involved in the regulation of infection, and then the expression of lncRNAs in the spleen tissues of the treated group and the untreated group was analyzed by RNA-seq data. In total, 8942 distinct lncRNA candidates were found. The number of diverse length distribution of lncRNAs was different, and the length of most lncRNAs was less than 500 nucleotides (Fig. 1A). As shown in Figure 1B, we found that a highly expressed lncRNA (named NARL according to the participating function) is copresent in the differentially expressed genes obtained after LPS stimulation and SCRV infection (Table S2). To characterize the complete sequence of NARL, the single-molecule full-length transcript sequencing was used and demonstrated that the length of NARL was 1992 base pairs (bp) and NRAL locates on miiuy croaker, N. diacanthus, and L. crocea chromosome 10, between gene EIF4E and gene lingo2a, and consists of only one exon (Fig. 1C). Then, we validated that NARL was mainly distributed in the cytoplasm by cytoplasm/nucleus fraction assay both in MIC cells and in MKC cells (Fig. 1D). Consistent with NARL being an ncRNA, no putative protein is conserved in all species, and the CPC (coding potential calculator) computational algorithm predicts that NARL has a very low coding potential (Fig. 1E). We first detected the NARL expression under different LPS or SCRV stimulation times to verify the results of RNA-seq. As shown in Figure 2A, we found that the expression of NARL was upregulated after LPS and SCRV stimulation. Two small interfering RNAs against NARL (si-NARL-1 and si-NARL-2) and the overexpression plasmid of NARL were constructed to explore the biological functions of NARL. As expected, both two siRNAs can inhibit the expression of NARL, and si-NARL-1 could induce higher inhibitory efficiency (Fig. 2B), so we chose si-NARL-1 to continue the follow-up experiment. And the NARL overexpression plasmid could significantly increase NARL expression levels (Fig. 2D). Inflammatory cytokines and IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) play an important role in the innate immune response; thus, we focused on investigating the function of NARL in regulating the expression of inflammatory cytokines and ISGs genes. As shown in Figure 2C, knockdown or overexpression NARL can significantly inhibit or promote the expression levels of TNF-α, IL-8, and IL-1β upon LPS stimulation. Then, knockdown or overexpression NARL also can significantly inhibit or promote the expression levels of TNF-α, MX1, and ISG15 upon SCRV infection (Fig. 2E). Furthermore, cell apoptosis analysis showed that NARL knockdown significantly increased the proportion of apoptotic cells (Fig. 2F). We conducted EdU assays and ATP activity assay to examine cell proliferation and cell viability for further explore the role of NARL in innate immunity. As shown in Figure 2, G and H, the results showed that knockdown of NARL considerably decreased the percentages of EdU-positive cells and cell viability, whereas it greatly increased when NARL was overexpressed. Previous studies have indicated that the low concentration of LPS can stimulate cell proliferative activity (30Zhu S. Lu Y. Dexmedetomidine suppressed the biological behavior of HK-2 cells treated with LPS by down-regulating ALKBH5.Inflammation. 2020; 43: 2256-2263Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). These results suggested that NARL can promote the proliferation and viability of miiuy croaker cell lines. To summarize, the data suggest that NARL plays as a positive modulator in regulating inflammatory responses, as well as cell proliferation and cell viability. The changes in cell proliferation and cell apoptosis are a result of the regulation effect of NARL on innate immune responses. In other words, NARL can positively regulate the antibacterial responses or antiviral response and upregulate the expression of inflammatory cytokines or antiviral genes, reducing the attack of pathogen to cells, promoting cell proliferation, and reducing cell apoptosis. Many cytoplasmic lncRNAs have been reported to act as ceRNAs by competitively binding miRNAs (29Fu T. Ji K. Jin L. Zhang J. Wu X. Ji X. Fan B. Jia Z. Wang A. Liu J. ASB16-AS1 up-regulated and phosphorylated TRIM37 to activate NF-κB pathway and promote proliferation, stemness, and cisplatin resistance of gastric cancer.J. Gastric. Cancer. 2020; 24: 45-59Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 31Li C. Gao Q. Wang M. Xin H. LncRNA SNHG1 contributes to the regulation of acute myeloid leukemia cell growth by modulating miR-489-3p/SOX12/Wnt/β-catenin signaling.J. Cell. Physiol. 2020; 236: 653-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Through the cytoplasm/nucleus fraction assay experiments, we have been able to determine that NARL is mainly distributed in the cytoplasm. Therefore, to further confirm whether NARL acts as a ceRNA, we first inserted the Argonaute-2 (Ago2) sequence into the pcDNA3.1-flag vector and obtained the Ago2-flag expression plasmid. We next construct the RIP assay with Ago2-flag in MIC cells. As shown in Figure 3A, NARL is significantly enriched in Ago2-containing micro-ribonucleoprotein complexes, which suggests that the miRNAs can directly bind to NARL. Then, we used Targetscan and miRanda softwares to predict miRNAs that can potentially target NARL and that the five microRNAs (including miR-217-5p, miR-103-5p, miR-143-5p, miR-221-5p, and miR-92-5p) were predicted to have a high probability of combining to NARL. Then, we used qRT-PCR to detect these five miRNAs’ expressions in MIC cells when overexpressing NARL expression plasmid, and the result shows that the expression of miR-217-5p is significantly downregulated compared with the other four miRNAs (Fig. 3B). Meanwhile, we found that the expression of miR-217-5p significantly increased when the NARL was silenced (Fig. 3C). To test whether NARL can affect miR-217-5p activity, we constructed miR-217-5p sensor. The miR-217-5p sensor was constructed by inserting two copies of perfectly matched miR-217-5p fragments into the psiCHECK-2 vector (Fig. 3D). Then, we transfected with the miR-217-5p sensor into cells, along with miR-217-5p, control vector, or NARL overexpression plasmid, suggesting that NARL specifically sponged miR-217-5p, thereby preventing it from inhibiting luciferase activity (Fig. 3E). Taken together, these data suggest that NARL could regulate miR-217-5p expression and activity, and NARL may function as a sponge of miR-217-5p. We analyzed the sequence of NARL and found a binding site for miR-217-5p to investigate whether NARL can directly interact with miR-217-5p. Then, we constructed the NARL luciferase plasmid and the mutant plasmid with the mutated miR-217-5p binding site (Fig. 4A). The luciferase assay shows that miR-217-5p mimics and pre-miR-217 plasmid can both significantly inhibit the wild-type NARL luciferase plasmid activity, but have no effect on the mutated form (Fig. 4B). In addition, we inserted the wild-type or the mutant-type fragment of NARL into the mVenus-C1 vector and cotransfected with miR-217-5p to confirm that whether miR-217-5p can inhibit the levels of GFP. As shown in Figure 4C, miR-217-5p can significantly inhibit the levels of GFP, but cannot inhibit the level of the mutant type of NARL-GFP. To extend the findings, the western blotting assay has been conducted to examine the expression level of GFP protein (Fig. 4D). These results indicate that NARL may interact with miR-217-5p through the predicted miR-217-5p bind site. Through the previous RIP experiment, we have known that NARL could directly bind to miRNAs (Fig. 3A). We thus further tested the ability of NARL to bind to miR-217-5p. To this end, the Ago2 RIP assays are performed in MIC cells by cotransfecting Ago2-flag and miR-217-5p. The results from qRT-PCR analysis suggested that NARL and miR-217-5p were efficiently pulled down by Ago2-flag (Fig. 4E). For further confirming the direct interaction between NARL and miR-217-5p, we performed biotin-avidin pull-down experiments to examine whether NARL can be pulled down by MIC cells that were transfected with biotinylated NARL or a mutated form, then harvested for pull-down assay. The result showed that miR-217-5p could pull down by biotinylated wild-type NARL (Fig. 4F). Then we constructed plasmids that recognize lncRNAs by MS2 protein. We insert the MS2-12X fragment into the pcDNA3.1, pcDNA3.1-NARL, and the mutated type of NARL plasmids (pcDNA3.1-NARL-mut). Additionally, we constructed a fusion expression plasmid of GFP and MS2 to produce MS2-GFP fusion protein (pcDNA3.1-MS2-GFP), and the protein can bind to MS2-12X and also GFP antibody. Therefore, if miRNAs can bind to NARL, miR-217-5p can be pulled down by the GFP-MS2-12X complex. Analysis of qPCR results showed that the miR-217-5p enrichment of NARL was significantly higher than that of mutant NARL and empty plasmid (Fig. 4G). In summary, these results indicated that NARL can directly bind to miR-217-5p, and NARL may act as a sponge of miR-217-5p. To explore the role of miR-217-5p against the innate immune response, miR-217-5p and miR-217-5p inhibitors were transfected into MIC cells and stimulated by LPS, respectively. The results showed that certain inflammatory cytokines, including TNF-α, IL-8, and IL-1β, are significantly decreased or increased by the introduction of miR-217-5p mimics or miR-217-5p inhibitor upon LPS stimulation. Furthermore, we found that miR-217-5p or miR-217-5p inhibitor also could significantly decrease or elevated ISGs genes respectively, including MX1 and ISG15 (Fig. 5B). Here, we find that the effect of the miR-217-5p inhibitor on the expression of some of the innate immune response genes is not robust, but there are significant differences; we think that this may be related to the inhibitory efficiency of miRNA inhibitor, and background level of miR-217-5p is not high in cells. Then, NOD1-3’UTR plasmid, miR-217-5p, and reporter genes were cotransfected into EPC cells for further verifying that NOD1 can be regulated by miR-217-5p. The results showed that miR-217-5p could inhibit the NF-κB, IL-8, IL-1β, and IRF3 report genes’ luciferase activity by inhibiting NOD1 (Fig. 5C). Furthermore, we tested the effects of miR-217-5p and miR-217-5p-i on MIC cell proliferation, the results showed that miR-217-5p inhibited cell proliferation and miR-217-5p-i promoted cell proliferation under LPS or SCRV stimulation (Fig. 5, D and E). Combined with our experimental results, we can think that an appropriate immune response or appropriate increase of cytokines will lead to cell proliferation and increase of cell viability. And excessive immune response or overexpression of some cytokines and genes will reduce cell proliferation and reduce cell activity. miR-217-5p regulates the expression of cytokines by inhibiting the expression of NOD1, thus affecting cell proliferation and cell viability. In summary, miR-217-5p plays an important regulatory role in inflammatory immune responses. Given that NARL interacts with miR-217-5p and miR-217-5p targets and regulates NOD1. Thus, we then tested whether NARL is able to regulate NOD1. NOD1 protein expression is significantly increased when NARL is overexpressed in MIC cells (left panel of Fig. 6A), while the NOD1 protein expression was significantly decreased through knockdown NARL (right panel of Fig. 6A). NARL expression plasmid or si-NARL is transfected into MIC cells and NOD1 expression levels were detected by qRT-PCR. The results show that NARL can indeed promote NOD1 expression while silencing NARL would significantly reduce NOD1 expression (Fig. 6B). These results indicated that miR-217-5p can inhibit NOD1 luciferase activity, while NARL can reverse the inhibition effect of miR-217-5p on NOD1 (Fig. 6C). Then, the MIC cells were cotransfected with miR-217-5p and NARL, and the western blotting assay showed that NARL could indeed reverse the inhibitory effect of miR-217-5p on NOD1 protein expression (Fig. 6D). Then, the NOD1 plasmid with full-length 3’UTR, miR-217-5p, NARL plasmid, and various reporter gene plasmids were cotransfected into EPC cells. The results showed that NARL could reverse the negative effect of miR-217-5p on the luciferase activities of NF-κB, IL-8, and IL-1β report genes (Fig. 6E). Moreover, we attempted to explore the effect of the NARL/miR-217-5p regulatory loop on cell proliferation. The results indicated that overexpression of NARL could counteract the negative effect of miR-217-5p on cell proliferation upon LPS or SCRV stimulation (Fig. 6F). We cotransfected miR-217-5p-i and si-NARL into MIC cells to further prove the results that NARL regulates NOD1 by modulating miR-217-5p. And the results show that miR-217-5p-i can reverse the negative effect of si-NARL on the NOD1 (Fig. 6G). Collectively, these data demonstrated that NARL serves as a ceRNA for miR-217-5p to regulate NOD1 expression. To address the generality of our findings, we first examined the sequence alignment of pre-miR-217 from different vertebrate species. Interestingly, as shown in Figure 7A, mature miR-217-5p displayed high conservation from mammals to fish. Further, the miR-217-5p binding site in NOD1 3’UTR also displayed high conservation from mammals to fish (Fig. 7B). To obtain the direct evidence that miR-217-5p could target NOD1 3’UTR across fish species, luciferase report plasmids were generated by cloning NOD1-3’UTR of L. crocea and N. diacanthus into pmirGLO vector, within the mutant devoid of miR-217-5p binding site as a control (Fig. 7C). Strikingly, miR-217-5p mimics were sufficient to decrease luciferase activities when respectively cotransfected with the wild types of L. crocea and N. diacanthus NOD1-3’UTR, whereas it shows no effect on the luciferase activity of cells transfected with their mutant-types (Fig. 7D). These results indicate that miR-217-5p can target the NOD1 gene in other fish species, which verifies that miR-217-5p is highly conserved among different species, and its function is also conserved to some extent. Additionally, we also verified the findings that miR-217-5p regulating lncRNA NARL a"

Nearly half of UM patients develop metastatic disease and often succumb within months because effective therapy is lacking. A novel therapeutic approach has been suggested by the discovery that UM cell lines driven by mutant constitutively active Gq or G11 can be targeted by FR900359 (FR) or YM-254890, which are bioavailable, selective inhibitors of the Gq/11/14 subfamily of heterotrimeric G proteins. Here, we have addressed the therapeutic potential of FR for UM. We found that FR inhibited all oncogenic Gq/11 mutants reported in UM. FR arrested growth of all Gq/11-driven UM cell lines tested, but induced apoptosis only in a few. Similarly, FR inhibited growth of, but did not efficiently kill, UM tumor cells from biopsies of primary or metastatic tumors. FR evoked melanocytic redifferentiation of UM tumor cells with low (class 1), but not high (class 2), metastatic potential. FR administered systemically below its LD50 strongly inhibited growth of PDX-derived class 1 and class 2 UM tumors in mouse xenograft models and reduced blood pressure transiently. FR did not regress xenografted UM tumors or significantly affect heart rate, liver function, hematopoiesis, or behavior. These results indicated the existence of a therapeutic window in which FR can be explored for treating UM and potentially other diseases caused by constitutively active Gq/11."
https://openalex.org/W3126633867,"Rapid rates of land use and land cover change (LULCC) in eastern Africa and limited instances of genuinely equal partnerships involving scientists, communities and decision makers challenge the development of robust pathways toward future environmental and socioeconomic sustainability. We use a participatory modelling tool, Kesho, to assess the biophysical, socioeconomic, cultural and governance factors that influenced past (1959–1999) and present (2000–2018) LULCC in northern Tanzania and to simulate four scenarios of land cover change to the year 2030. Simulations of the scenarios used spatial modelling to integrate stakeholders’ perceptions of future environmental change with social and environmental data on recent trends in LULCC. From stakeholders’ perspectives, between 1959 and 2018, LULCC was influenced by climate variability, availability of natural resources, agriculture expansion, urbanization, tourism growth and legislation governing land access and natural resource management. Among other socio-environmental-political LULCC drivers, the stakeholders envisioned that from 2018 to 2030 LULCC will largely be influenced by land health, natural and economic capital, and political will in implementing land use plans and policies. The projected scenarios suggest that by 2030 agricultural land will have expanded by 8–20% under different scenarios and herbaceous vegetation and forest land cover will be reduced by 2.5–5% and 10–19% respectively. Stakeholder discussions further identified desirable futures in 2030 as those with improved infrastructure, restored degraded landscapes, effective wildlife conservation, and better farming techniques. The undesirable futures in 2030 were those characterized by land degradation, poverty, and cultural loss. Insights from our work identify the implications of future LULCC scenarios on wildlife and cultural conservation and in meeting the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and targets by 2030. The Kesho approach capitalizes on knowledge exchanges among diverse stakeholders, and in the process promotes social learning, provides a sense of ownership of outputs generated, democratizes scientific understanding, and improves the quality and relevance of the outputs."

A newly developed surrogate viral neutralization assay (sVNT) offers the ability to detect total receptor binding domain-targeting NAbs in an isotype-independent manner, increasing the test sensitivity. Thus, specimens with low IgM/ IgG antibody levels showed strong neutralization activity in sVNT.This study aimed to measure the %inhibition of NAbs measured by sVNT in PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients. The sensitivity of sVNT for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection and its kinetics were determined.Ninety-seven patients with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were included in this study. Majority of the patients were 21-40 years old (67%) and 63% had mild symptoms. The sensitivity of sVNT for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection was 99% (95% confidence interval (CI) 94.4-100%) and the specificity was 100% (95% CI 98.3-100%). The negative predictive value of sVNT from the samples collected before and after 7 days of symptom onset was 99.5% (95% CI 97.4-100%) and 100% (95% CI 93.8-100%), respectively. The level of inhibition at days 8-14 were significantly higher than days 0-7 (p<0.001). The median %inhibition values by severity of COVID-19 symptoms were 79.9% (interquartile range (IQR) 49.7-91.8%); 89.0% (IQR 71.2-92.4%); and 86.6% (IQR 69.5-92.8%), for mild, moderate and severe/critical symptoms respectively. The median level of sVNT %inhibition of severe was significantly higher than the mild group (p = 0.05).The sVNT is a practical and robust serological test for SARS-CoV-2 infection and does not require specialized biosafety containment. It can be used clinically to aid diagnosis in both early and late infection especially in cases when the real-time RT-PCR results in weakly negative or weakly positive, and to determine the protective immune response from SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients."
https://openalex.org/W3128391644,"Introduction Respectful Maternity Care is important for achieving a positive labour and birth experience. Client-care provider interaction—specifically respect, communication, confidentiality and autonomy—is an important aspect of Respectful Maternity Care. The aim of this study was twofold: (1) to assess Dutch women’s experience of respect, communication, confidentiality and autonomy during labour and birth and (2) to identify which client characteristics are associated with experiencing optimal respect, communication, confidentiality and autonomy. Methods Pregnant women and women who recently gave birth in the Netherlands were recruited to fill out a validated web-based questionnaire (ReproQ). Mean scores per domain (scale 1–4) were calculated. Domains were dichotomised in non-optimal (score 1, 2,3) and optimal client-care provider interaction (score 4), and a multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed. Results Of the 1367 recruited women, 804 respondents completed the questionnaire and 767 respondents completed enough questions to be included for analysis. Each domain had a mean score above 3.5. The domain confidentiality had the highest proportion of optimal scores (64.0%), followed by respect (53.3%), communication (45.1%) and autonomy (36.2%). In all four domains, women who gave birth at home with a community midwife had a higher proportion of optimal scores than women who gave birth in the hospital with a (resident) obstetrician or hospital-based midwife. Lower education level, being multiparous and giving birth spontaneously were also significantly associated with a higher proportion of optimal scores in (one of) the domains. Discussion This study shows that on average women scored high on experienced client-care provider interaction in the domains respect, communication, confidentiality and autonomy. At the same time, client-care provider interaction in the Netherlands still fell short of being optimal for a large number of women, in particular regarding women’s autonomy. These results show there is still room for improvement in client-care provider interaction during labour and birth."

The phosphorylation (P) and nucleotide-binding (N) domains form the catalytic site, while the actuator (A) domain is involved in the transduction of conformational changes required for the Ca-uptake function involving the transmembrane (TM) domain (4Smeazzetto S.

All long-known endogenous membrane protein regulators of SERCA (e.g., PLB, sarcolipin) are inhibitory, but a SERCA-activating peptide termed dwarf open reading frame (DWORF) has recently been identified (19Nelson B.R.

A peptide encoded by a transcript annotated as long noncoding RNA enhances SERCA activity in muscle.Science. 2016; 351: 271-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). DWORF activates SERCA2a in the SR of cardiac myocytes, where PLB is also present; leading to the hypothesis that DWORF activates SERCA2a indirectly by displacing PLB but has no direct effect on SERCA2a function (19Nelson B.R. Makarewich C.A. Anderson D.M. Winders B.R. Troupes C.D. Wu F. Reese A.L. McAnally J.R. Chen X. Kavalali E.T. Cannon S.C. Houser S.R. Bassel-Duby R. Olson E.N. A peptide encoded by a transcript annotated as long noncoding RNA enhances SERCA activity in muscle.Science. 2016; 351: 271-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have investigated this mechanism by using fluorescence lifetime (FLT) detection of FRET, to determine quantitatively the interactions of PLB and DWORF (separately and in combination) with SERCA2a and correlate with functional assays of SERCA activity on the same samples (10Cornea R.L.

Cell Cardiol. 2020; 138: 59-65Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). With this approach, we find that DWORF increases the Ca-ATPase activity of SERCA not only by displacing the inhibitory PLB, but also through direct interactions with SERCA2a in the absence of PLB. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we identified two DWORF residues, P15 and W22 (in the human isoform), as essential for activation of SERCA2a. These findings provide key insights needed to develop effective therapies for heart failure. To study the SERCA2a–DWORF interaction in living cells, we developed a FRET-based biosensor system by fusing green fluorescent protein (GFP) and tagRFP (red fluorescent protein) to the N termini of SERCA2a and DWORF, respectively. In this biosensor, GFP-SERCA (the FRET donor) is stably expressed, while RFP–DWORF (the FRET acceptor) is transiently expressed to allow varying the expression level. Fluorescence microscopy confirmed that both GFP–SERCA2a and RFP–DWORF are expressed and colocalized in the ER (Fig. 1A). In a control experiment, we show that transient transfection of unlabeled DWORF or mutant DWORF into a stable cell line expressing GFP–SERCA2a does not alter the FLT of the donor (Fig. S1). The FRET efficiency (E) and the fraction of donor molecules in proximity to acceptor molecules (XDA) were calculated using multiexponential FLT data analysis (see Methods). Due to the R−6 dependence of FRET on the donor–acceptor distance R, XDA is a reliable measurement of the fraction of donor-labeled SERCA population that has bound acceptor-labeled PLB or DWORF (16Stroik D.R.

We found that increasing RFP–DWORF expression results in increasing FRET (E) and XDA (Fig. 1, B and C), indicating that RFP–DWORF and GFP–SERCA2a are expressed and bound to each other in live cells. FRET values did approach saturation, because the transfection system did not tolerate higher levels of RFP–DWORF DNA. We transfected increasing amounts of a plasmid carrying unlabeled DWORF into a stable cell line coexpressing GFP-SERCA2a (donor) and RFP-PLB (acceptor) (Fig. 2A). In the absence of DWORF, FRET efficiency between labeled SERCA and PLB was E = 0.13 ± 0.01, and the mole fraction of SERCA-bound donor in contact with PLB-bound acceptor was XDA = 0.30 ± 0.03 (Fig. 2, B and C). Addition of increasing levels of the unlabeled DWORF plasmid resulted in gradually decreased FRET efficiency, reaching a residual level of E = 0.01 ± 0.01 at 5 μg of untagged DWORF DNA per well. This decrease in the interaction between GFP-SERCA2a and RFP-PLB is consistent with the observed substantial decrease in the mole fraction XDA of GFP-SERCA bound to RFP-PLB resolved by multiexponential analysis of the FLT-FRET waveforms (Fig. 2C). We conclude that DWORF competes effectively with PLB for binding to SERCA2a. DWORF consists of a 23-residue TM domain and an 11-residue cytoplasmic domain that forms a short helix on the cytoplasmic side of the SR membrane (9Mozaffarian D. Benjamin E.J. Go A.S. Arnett D.K.

A peptide encoded by a transcript annotated as long noncoding RNA enhances SERCA activity in muscle.Science. 2016; 351: 271-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). To determine which of these domains is responsible for functional interaction with SERCA2a, we engineered a truncated DWORF mutant containing only the TM domain. The RFP-labeled TM domain of DWORF (RFP–TM–DWORF) was transiently transfected into HEK293 cells stably expressing GFP-SERCA2a. With increasing RFP–TM–DWORF expression, we observed increases in both FRET (E) and XDA values, similar to those observed with full-length DWORF (Fig. 3, A and B). This suggests that the TM domain of DWORF interacts with SERCA similarly to full-length DWORF. Next, we used an unlabeled TM–DWORF construct, to quantify competitive binding of TM–DWORF to GFP-SERCA2a in the presence of RFP-PLB. As in experiments using unlabeled full-length DWORF (Fig. 2C), we observed a decrease in the FRET efficiency E (Fig. 3C), corresponding to a decrease in the mole fraction XDA of GFP-SERCA2a transferring energy to RFP-PLB (Fig. 3D). We conclude that the TM domain of DWORF is sufficient to compete with PLB for binding to SERCA2a. To determine which residues within the TM domain of DWORF are important for complex formation with SERCA2a, DWORF mutants were selected for testing based on evolutionary conservation (Fig. 4A). Initially, we tested the effects on single mutations on the ability of fluorescently labeled DWORF constructs to bind to labeled SERCA2a and participate in FRET. However, we did not observe significant differences in the binding affinities of single-mutation DWORF constructs for SERCA2a, as compared with the WT–DWORF controls (Fig. 4C). Given that the protein–protein interface between TM domains of the SERCA–DWORF complex may involve interactions involving multiple DWORF residues, we set out to test whether a combination of two mutations is sufficient to ablate complex formation. We found that one combination, a double mutant in which P15 and W22 are both substituted with alanine, showed significant decreases in both FRET efficiency and XDA (Fig. 4, D and E), indicating that this mutant DWORF binds SERCA2a with a significantly lower affinity than the WT–DWORF controls. The RFP fluorescence intensity was indistinguishable for WT–DWORF and mutants, indicating that their expression levels were similar (Fig. 4D). We also tested whether the unlabeled P15A/W22A DWORF mutant can effectively compete for binding to GFP–SERCA in the presence of RFP-PLB and found that competitive binding is substantially decreased by the double mutation (Fig. 4F), which is strikingly different from the equivalent measurements above with WT–DWORF (Fig. 2B) and TM–DWORF (Fig. 3C). Based on the DWORF TM domain sequence, which is predicted to form a single helix, both P15 and W22 residues are expected to be on the same face of the helix (Fig. 4B), suggesting that this is the protein–protein interface between the TM domains of SERCA2a and DWORF. Based on the FRET measurements above, it is clear that DWORF competes effectively with PLB for binding to SERCA2a (Fig. 2), and this competition has been shown to reverse PLB inhibition of SERCA2a (19Nelson B.R. Makarewich C.A. Anderson D.M. Winders B.R. Troupes C.D. Wu F. Reese A.L. McAnally J.R. Chen X. Kavalali E.T. Cannon S.C. Houser S.R. Bassel-Duby R. Olson E.N. A peptide encoded by a transcript annotated as long noncoding RNA enhances SERCA activity in muscle.Science. 2016; 351: 271-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). Our FRET measurements show that DWORF also binds to SERCA in the absence of PLB (Fig. 1). To test the hypothesis that DWORF activates SERCA2a directly in the absence of PLB, we performed Ca-ATPase assays in HEK293 cells overexpressing GFP-SERCA2a and varying amounts of DWORF, in the absence of PLB (Fig. 5). Surprisingly, we found that DWORF activates SERCA2a directly at subsaturating [Ca2+], increasing the apparent Ca affinity of SERCA2a (Fig. 5A). Similar results were obtained with RFP–DWORF (Fig. S2), indicating that the tag does not significantly affect DWORF function. As a control, we tested the effects of the double-mutant P15A/W22A DWORF, which displays low affinity toward SERCA2a in our FRET assays, and found that this construct has a substantially decreased effect on Ca-ATPase function (Fig. 5B). Since the Ca-ATPase measurements were done using whole cell extracts from transfected cells, and plasma membranes from virtually all cells are known to express relatively high levels of Ca-sensitive nonspecific nucleotidase activity and NADH oxidase activity, not all Ca-ATPase activity measured on homogenized cells is due to SERCA. However, treatment with the SERCA-specific inhibitor thapsigargin (Tg) eliminates most Ca-ATPase activity of the GFP-SERCA2a stable cell line (Fig. 5, A and B). By combining structural (FRET) and functional (Ca-ATPase) measurements, the present study reveals a new role for DWORF in calcium regulation. In our model, DWORF binds to SERCA2a, displacing PLB, and activates SERCA via two distinct mechanisms: (a) DWORF displaces the inhibitory PLB and (b) DWORF activates SERCA directly, above the level of SERCA in the absence of both DWORF and PLB. Residues P15 and W22 in the TM domain of DWORF are required for DWORF–SERCA binding. The causes of HF are complex, but growing evidence indicates that central factors include increased basal cytosolic [Ca2+], correlated with decreased [Ca2+] in the SR lumen. Since SERCA2a is a major determinant of cardiomyocytes cytosolic [Ca2+], increasing SERCA2a activity is a potential therapy for a myriad of chronic cardiac pathologies (20Zhihao L. Jingyu N. Lan L. Michael S. Rui G. Xiyun B. Xiaozhi L. Guanwei F. SERCA2a: A key protein in the Ca(2+) cycle of the heart failure.Heart Fail. Rev. 2020; 25: 523-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In support of this hypothesis, DWORF enhances SERCA2a activity and contractility in a HF mouse model (21Makarewich C.A. Munir A.Z. Schiattarella G.G. Bezprozvannaya S. Raguimova O.N. Cho E.E.

The DWORF micropeptide enhances contractility and prevents heart failure in a mouse model of dilated cardiomyopathy.Elife. 2018; 7e38319Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Here we study this mechanism through direct detection of protein–protein complex formation, using FRET biosensors based on DWORF, PLB, and SERCA2a. We observed that DWORF binds directly to SERCA2a (Fig. 1) and competes effectively with PLB for SERCA2a binding (Fig. 2). This is consistent with previous in vivo observations (19Nelson B.R. Makarewich C.A. Anderson D.M. Winders B.R. Troupes C.D. Wu F. Reese A.L. McAnally J.R. Chen X. Kavalali E.T. Cannon S.C. Houser S.R. Bassel-Duby R. Olson E.N. A peptide encoded by a transcript annotated as long noncoding RNA enhances SERCA activity in muscle.Science. 2016; 351: 271-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar) and fluorescence-based measurements showing that SERCA has a higher apparent affinity for DWORF than for PLB (21Makarewich C.A. Munir A.Z. Schiattarella G.G. Bezprozvannaya S. Raguimova O.N. Cho E.E. Vidal A.H. Robia S.L. Bassel-Duby R. Olson E.N. The DWORF micropeptide enhances contractility and prevents heart failure in a mouse model of dilated cardiomyopathy.Elife. 2018; 7e38319Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). DWORF is reported to interact with SERCA2a to form a heterodimer (22Singh D.R. Dalton M.P. Cho E.E. Pribadi M.P. Zak T.J. Seflova J. Makarewich C.A. Olson E.N. Robia S.L. Newly discovered micropeptide regulators of SERCA form oligomers but bind to the pump as monomers.J. Mol. Biol. 2019; 431: 4429-4443Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). We observed that DWORF activates SERCA2a directly, in the absence of PLB, by enhancing the Ca-ATPase apparent calcium affinity (Fig. 5A). This direct activation of SERCA2a by DWORF was not detected in previous studies (22Singh D.R. Dalton M.P. Cho E.E. Pribadi M.P. Zak T.J. Seflova J. Makarewich C.A. Olson E.N. Robia S.L. Newly discovered micropeptide regulators of SERCA form oligomers but bind to the pump as monomers.J. Mol. Biol. 2019; 431: 4429-4443Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). This difference may be due to differences in SERCA2a–DWORF stoichiometry, cell lines used, and/or the presence of protein tags. Given that we measured Ca-ATPase activity using an unlabeled construct at the same SERCA2a–DWORF stoichiometry as in our structure-based assays, we propose that these findings reveal a new role for DWORF, in which DWORF functions as a bona fide activator of SERCA2a. We have shown that the TM domain of DWORF is sufficient for complex formation with SERCA2a and subsequent activation (Fig. 3) (Fig. S3). We identified two resides, P15 and W22, that are important for this interaction (Fig. 4).When P15 and W22 are both mutated to A, the fraction of SERCA2a containing bound DWORF decreases by a factor of 4 (Fig. 5B), indicating that this double mutant fails to activate SERCA2a primarily due to decreased binding. However, the double mutant did not completely eliminate FRET or XDA, the fraction of SERCA containing bound DWORF (Fig. 4, D and E), indicating that the double mutation eliminates activation by bound DWORF. Additional DWORF mutants should be tested in the future to determine whether other residues are important for SERCA2a–DWORF interactions. Future structural studies (e.g., crystallography and cryo-EM) will be needed to further explore the mechanism of DWORF’s effect on SERCA2a. The current study demonstrates that DWORF binds to SERCA2a, competing with PLB (Fig. 2). The binding of DWORF to SERCA2a depends entirely on the TM domain of DWORF (Fig. 3), and mutation of TM residues P15 and W22 to A greatly decreases the binding of DWORF to SERCA2a (Fig. 4). These results are consistent with the previous proposal that DWORF activates SERCA2a by displacing the inhibitory PLB (19Nelson B.R. Makarewich C.A. Anderson D.M. Winders B.R. Troupes C.D. Wu F. Reese A.L. McAnally J.R. Chen X. Kavalali E.T. Cannon S.C. Houser S.R. Bassel-Duby R. Olson E.N. A peptide encoded by a transcript annotated as long noncoding RNA enhances SERCA activity in muscle.Science. 2016; 351: 271-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). However, we find that DWORF also activates SERCA2a directly in the absence of PLB, while the double mutant has no effect (Fig. 5). These results will help to inform future efforts in therapeutic design; a better understanding of the regulation of SERCA2a by small TM proteins is essential for development of new classes of therapeutics in heart failure research."

We (1) characterized and analyzed data collected from the first cohort of reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)-confirmed COVID-19 cases reported in the Emirate of Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, according to the symptomatic state, and (2) identified factors associated with the symptomatic state. The association between the symptomatic state and testing positive in three subsequent RT-PCR testing rounds was also quantified. Between February 28 and April 8, 2020, 1,249 cases were reported. Sociodemographic characteristics, working status, travel history, and chronic comorbidities of 791 cases were analyzed according to the symptomatic state (symptomatic or asymptomatic). After the first confirmatory test, the results of three subsequent tests were analyzed. The mean age of the 791 cases was 35.6 ± 12.7 years (range: 1-81). Nearly 57.0% of cases were symptomatic. The two most frequent symptoms were fever (58.0%) and cough (41.0%). Symptomatic cases (mean age 36.3 ± 12.6 years) were significantly older than asymptomatic cases (mean age 34.5 ± 12.7 years). Compared with nonworking populations, working in public places (adjusted odds ratio (aOR), 1.76, 95% confidence interval (95% CI): 1.11-2.80), healthcare settings (aOR, 2.09, 95% CI: 1.01-4.31), or in the aviation and tourism sectors (aOR, 2.24, 95% CI: 1.14-4.40) was independently associated with the symptomatic state. Reporting at least one chronic comorbidity was also associated with symptomatic cases (aOR, 1.76, 95% CI: 1.03-3.01). Compared with asymptomatic cases, symptomatic cases had a prolonged duration of viral shedding and consistent odds of ≥2 positive COVID-19 tests result out of the three subsequent testing rounds. A substantial proportion of the diagnosed COVID-19 cases in the Emirate of Abu Dhabi were asymptomatic. Quarantining asymptomatic cases, implementing prevention measures, and raising awareness among populations working in high-risk settings are warranted."
https://openalex.org/W3127587726,"Components of the autophagy machinery are subject to regulation by various posttranslational modifications. Previous studies showed that monoubiquitination of LC3B catalyzed by the ubiquitin-activating enzyme UBA6 and ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme/ubiquitin ligase BIRC6 targets LC3B for proteasomal degradation, thus reducing LC3B levels and autophagic activity under conditions of stress. However, mechanisms capable of counteracting this process are not known. Herein, we report that LC3B ubiquitination is reversed by the action of the deubiquitinating enzyme USP10. We identified USP10 in a CRISPR-Cas9 knockout screen for ubiquitination-related genes that regulate LC3B levels. Biochemical analyses showed that silencing of USP10 reduces the levels of both the LC3B-I and LC3B-II forms of LC3B through increased ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. In turn, the reduced LC3B levels result in slower degradation of the autophagy receptors SQSTM1 and NBR1 and an increased accumulation of puromycin-induced aggresome-like structures. Taken together, these findings indicate that the levels of LC3B and autophagic activity are controlled through cycles of LC3B ubiquitination and deubiquitination."

This study addressed the hypothesis that pruritus is caused by solutes that accumulate in the plasma when the kidneys fail. We sought to identify solutes responsible for uremic pruritus using metabolomic analysis to compare the plasma of hemodialysis patients with severe pruritus versus mild/no pruritus. Pruritus severity in hemodialysis patients was assessed using a 100-mm visual analogue scale (VAS), with severe pruritus defined as &gt;70 mm and mild/no pruritus defined as &lt;10 mm. Twelve patients with severe pruritus (Itch) and 24 patients with mild/no pruritus (No Itch) were included. Pre-treatment plasma and plasma ultrafiltrate were analyzed using an established metabolomic platform (Metabolon, Inc.). To identify solutes associated with pruritus, we compared the average peak area of each solute in the Itch patients to that of the No Itch patients using the false discovery rate (q value) and principal component analysis. Dialysis vintage, Kt/V urea , and serum levels of calcium, phosphorus, PTH, albumin, ferritin, and hemoglobin were similar in the Itch and No Itch patients. Metabolomic analysis identified 1,548 solutes of which 609 were classified as uremic. No difference in the plasma or plasma ultrafiltrate levels of any solute or group of solutes was found between the Itch and No Itch patients. Metabolomic analysis of hemodialysis patients did not reveal any solutes associated with pruritus. A limitation of metabolomic analysis is that the solute of interest may not be included in the metabolomic platform’s chemical library. A role for uremic solutes in pruritus remains to be established."
https://openalex.org/W3127670391,"Children and young people in the UK have worse health outcomes than in many similar western countries and child health inequalities are persistent and increasing. Systems thinking has emerged as a promising approach to addressing complex public health issues. We report on a systems approach to mapping the determinants of child health inequalities at the local level in England for young people aged 0–25, and describe the resulting map. Qualitative group concept mapping workshops were held in two contrasting English local authorities with a range of stakeholders: professionals (N = 35); children and young people (N = 33) and carers (N = 5). Initial area maps were developed, and augmented using data from qualitative interviews with professionals (N = 16). The resulting local maps were reviewed and validated by expert stakeholders in each area (N = 9; N = 35). Commonalities between two area-specific system maps (and removal of locality-specific factors) were used to develop a map that could be applied in any English local area. Two rounds of online survey (N = 21; N = 8) experts in public health, local governance and systems science refined the final system map displaying the determinants of child health inequalities. The process created a map of over 150 factors influencing inequalities in health outcomes for children aged 0–25 years at the local area level. The system map has six domains; physical environment, governance, economic, social, service, and personal. To our knowledge this is the first study taking a systems approach to addressing inequalities across all aspects of child health. The study shows how group concept mapping can support systems thinking at the local level. The resulting system map illustrates the complexity of factors influencing child health inequalities, and it may be a useful tool in demonstrating to stakeholders the importance of policies that tackle the systemic drivers of child health inequalities beyond those traditionally associated with public health."

Using an established murine model of RA-associated lung disease combining collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) with organic dust extract (ODE)-induced airway inflammation, differences among lung immune cell populations were analyzed by single cell RNA-sequencing. Additionally, four lung myeloid-derived immune cell populations including macrophages, monocytes/macrophages, monocytes, and neutrophils were isolated by fluorescence cell sorting and gene expression was determined by NanoString analysis. Unsupervised clustering revealed 14 discrete clusters among Sham, CIA, ODE, and CIA+ODE treatment groups: 3 neutrophils (inflammatory, resident/transitional, autoreactive/suppressor), 5 macrophages (airspace, differentiating/recruited, recruited, resident/interstitial, and proliferative airspace), 2 T-cells (differentiating and effector), and a single cluster each of inflammatory monocytes, dendritic cells, B-cells and natural killer cells. Inflammatory monocytes, autoreactive/suppressor neutrophils, and recruited/differentiating macrophages were predominant with arthritis induction (CIA and CIA+ODE). By specific lung cell isolation, several interferon-related and autoimmune genes were disproportionately expressed among CIA and CIA+ODE (e.g. Oasl1, Oas2, Ifit3, Gbp2, Ifi44, and Zbp1), corresponding to RA and RA-associated lung disease. Monocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells were reduced, while complement genes (e.g. C1s1 and Cfb) were uniquely increased in CIA+ODE mice across cell populations. Recruited and inflammatory macrophages/monocytes and neutrophils expressing interferon-, autoimmune-, and complement-related genes might contribute towards pro-fibrotic inflammatory lung responses following airborne biohazard exposures in setting of autoimmune arthritis and could be predictive and/or targeted to reduce disease burden."
https://openalex.org/W3128256177,"Urban agglomerations are fundamental regional units of development and attract large-scale migrant population. Previous studies have only focused on migrant population distribution in major urban agglomerations. Therefore, this study analysed the spatiotemporal characteristics of migrant population distribution in China during 2000–2010 at city level from the perspective of urban agglomerations. The results indicate that urban agglomerations were accumulation areas of migrant population. Numerous people have migrated into 19 urban agglomerations, which has enlarged regional differences in migrant population distribution. The interprovincial migrant population dominated within urban agglomerations, whereas the intraprovincial migrant population dominated outside urban agglomerations. In the future, intraprovincial migration will become the dominant migration mode. The evolution of migrant population distribution pattern in urban agglomerations agrees with classic theories of unbalanced regional development. The determinants of migration in different regions were compared. Results revealed that economic and government driving forces jointly influenced migration; however, economic forces exceeded government forces. Economic forces were more influential within urban agglomerations, whereas government forces played more important roles outside urban agglomerations. Increased income and job opportunities were the core attractions of urban agglomerations. Moreover, with an increase in the urban agglomeration development level, the influence of economic forces increased, whereas that of government forces decreased. The findings provide a deeper understanding of migrant population distribution in China, which will benefit population management across various regions."
https://openalex.org/W3131778592,"Trace element selenium (Se) is incorporated as the 21st amino acid, selenocysteine, into selenoproteins through tRNA[Ser]Sec. Selenoproteins act as gatekeepers of redox homeostasis and modulate immune function to effect anti-inflammation and resolution. However, mechanistic underpinnings involving metabolic reprogramming during inflammation and resolution remain poorly understood. Bacterial endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS) activation of murine bone marrow–derived macrophages cultured in the presence or absence of Se (as selenite) was used to examine temporal changes in the proteome and metabolome by multiplexed tandem mass tag–quantitative proteomics, metabolomics, and machine-learning approaches. Kinetic deltagram and clustering analysis indicated that addition of Se led to extensive reprogramming of cellular metabolism upon stimulation with LPS enhancing the pentose phosphate pathway, tricarboxylic acid cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation, to aid in the phenotypic transition toward alternatively activated macrophages, synonymous with resolution of inflammation. Remodeling of metabolic pathways and consequent metabolic adaptation toward proresolving phenotypes began with Se treatment at 0 h and became most prominent around 8 h after LPS stimulation that included succinate dehydrogenase complex, pyruvate kinase, and sedoheptulokinase. Se-dependent modulation of these pathways predisposed bone marrow–derived macrophages to preferentially increase oxidative phosphorylation to efficiently regulate inflammation and its timely resolution. The use of macrophages lacking selenoproteins indicated that all three metabolic nodes were sensitive to selenoproteome expression. Furthermore, inhibition of succinate dehydrogenase complex with dimethylmalonate affected the proresolving effects of Se by increasing the resolution interval in a murine peritonitis model. In summary, our studies provide novel insights into the role of cellular Se via metabolic reprograming to facilitate anti-inflammation and proresolution."

Simkin A. Gascon E. Gao F.B. MicroRNA-9: Functional evolution of a conserved small regulatory RNA.RNA Biol. 2011; 8: 557-564Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In humans, pri-miR-9 can be transcribed from chromosomes 1 (pri-miR-9-1), 5 (pri-miR-9-2), and 15 (pri-miR-9-3); the mature miRNA sequences generated from all three loci are identical. Only pre-miR-9-2 is expressed in neural stem cells differentiated from human induced pluripotent stem cells (22Delaloy C. Liu L. Lee J.A. Su H. Shen F. Yang G.Y. Young W.L. Ivey K.N. Gao F.B.

Moreover, a gene set enrichment analysis using summary statistics from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium found an enrichment of predicted miR-9 target mRNAs among schizophrenia-associated genes (24Hauberg M.E.

These results suggest that genetic variants in both miR-9 and its targets are associated with an increased risk of schizophrenia. DiGeorge syndrome is caused by the chromosomal deletion 22q11.2, where the DGCR8 gene is located, and patients often show cognitive and behavioral impairment (25Shiohama A. Sasaki T. Noda S.

The mouse model for haploinsufficiency of the Dgcr8 gene shows abnormal miRNA biogenesis caused by decreased Dgcr8 gene expression, schizophrenia-like deficits, and decreased neurogenesis in the adult hippocampus (29Stark K.L.

Neurosci. 2013; 33: 9408-9419Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Of interest, this model also revealed that only a subset of pri-miRNA genes is upregulated and that a smaller subset of mature miRNAs is downregulated (29Stark K.L. Xu B. Bagchi A. Lai W.S. Liu H. Hsu R. Wan X. Pavlidis P. Mills A.A. Karayiorgou M. Gogos J.A. Altered brain microRNA biogenesis contributes to phenotypic deficits in a 22q11-deletion mouse model.Nat. Genet. 2008; 40: 751-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). pri-miR-9-2 is one of the most upregulated pri-miRNAs in the adult hippocampus of model mice, supporting the fact that DGCR8 more efficiently processes miR-9-2 than other miRNA species. Considering that miR-9 is a critical miRNA for the differentiation of neural precursor cells (21Davila J.L. Goff L.A. Ricupero C.L. Camarillo C. Oni E.N. Swerdel M.R. Toro-Ramos A.J. Li J. Hart R.P. A positive feedback mechanism that regulates expression of miR-9 during neurogenesis.PLoS One. 2014; 9: e94348Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), the DGCR8–miR-9-2 axis is thought to be involved in neurogenic differentiation and a cause of schizophrenia. In this study, we address the underlying mechanism of how DGCR8 efficiently processes pri-miR-9-2 to contribute to the generation of miR-9. To analyze this efficiency, we performed a cellular optimized pri-miRNA processing assay using a ratiometric fluorescence reporter, based on a similar system reported previously (31Weitz S.H. Gong M. Barr I. Weiss S. Guo F. Processing of microRNA primary transcripts requires heme in mammalian cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2014; 111: 1861-1866Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Using this assay in combination with various types of miRNAs and pri-miR-9 mutant reporters, we provide clear evidence that pri-miR-9-2 has a novel DGCR8-responsive RNA element (DRE) that is well conserved among mammalian species and promotes DGCR8-dependent pri-miRNA processing activity. To analyze the DGCR8-dependent pri-miRNA processing activity of pri-miR-9, we performed a live-cell pri-miRNA processing assay using a ratiometric fluorescence reporter, based on a similar system reported previously for examining pri-miRNA processing activities regulated by ectopically expressing DGCR8 and its mutants (31Weitz S.H. Gong M. Barr I. Weiss S. Guo F. Processing of microRNA primary transcripts requires heme in mammalian cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2014; 111: 1861-1866Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). We further optimized a ratiometric reporter construct based on a plasmid that simultaneously expresses two fluorescent proteins, tdTomato and Venus-fused PEST sequence, a signal peptide for protein degradation, driven by a bidirectional tetracycline-inducible promoter (Fig. 1A). In our reporter construct, pri-miRNA sequences were subcloned into the 3′-UTR of the tdTomato expression cassette, whereas the Venus 3′-UTR was intact. This construct expresses tdTomato-encoding mRNA containing pri-miRNA-fused 3′-UTR RNA. Once the Drosha/DGCR8 microprocessor complex cleaves pri-miRNA in the 3′-UTR, the polyadenylation (poly(A)) signal from tdTomato mRNA is removed, causing tdTomato protein expression to decrease because of mRNA and protein degradation. Of importance, the Drosha/DGCR8 microprocessor complex does not affect the Venus fluorescence signal associated with individual cell transcriptional and translational activities. Thus, the tdTomato:Venus ratio should negatively correlate with pri-miRNA processing activity. In this study, we used the reciprocal Venus:tdTomato ratio as a positive indicator of pri-miRNA processing efficiency, as described previously (31Weitz S.H. Gong M. Barr I. Weiss S. Guo F. Processing of microRNA primary transcripts requires heme in mammalian cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2014; 111: 1861-1866Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). First, we engineered 300 nucleotides (nt) of human pri-miR-9-1 into our fluorescent reporter. HeLa Tet-On 3G cells transiently transfected with control or pri-miR-9-1 fluorescent reporter showed nuclear expression of Venus and tdTomato because of the presence of an N-terminal nuclear localization signal tag. The Venus and tdTomato signal intensity was monitored, and nuclei with a Venus signal were selected (Fig. 1B). Then, Venus signals were calculated relative to the tdTomato signal for each well as an indicator of pri-miRNA processing efficiency (Fig. 1C). Ectopically overexpressing N-terminal FLAG-tagged DGCR8 (FLAG-DGCR8) promoted pri-miRNA processing activity in the fluorescence-based live-cell pri-miRNA processing reporter assay, as reported previously (31Weitz S.H. Gong M. Barr I. Weiss S. Guo F. Processing of microRNA primary transcripts requires heme in mammalian cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2014; 111: 1861-1866Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The C-terminal tail of DGCR8 was previously shown to be required for pri-miRNA processing (31Weitz S.H. Gong M. Barr I. Weiss S. Guo F. Processing of microRNA primary transcripts requires heme in mammalian cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2014; 111: 1861-1866Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 32Faller M. Toso D.

Lee Y. Han J. Suh M.R. Kim V.N. Characterization of DGCR8/Pasha, the essential cofactor for Drosha in primary miRNA processing.Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 4622-4629Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), and a mutant with the C-terminal tail deleted did not promote pri-miRNA processing activity, as reported previously. We also constructed a mutant pri-miR-9-1 reporter pri-miR-9-1M, which did not respond to ectopic FLAG-DGCR8 expression because of four point mutations within the pri-miR-9-1 cleavage site (Figs. 1C and S1). The fluorescent miRNA processing assay was performed with the pri-miR-9-1M reporter vector. Ectopically expressing FLAG-DGCR8 promoted pri-miRNA processing activity in cells transfected with the pri-miR-9-1 reporter but not in those transfected with the pri-miR-9-1M reporter (Fig. 1D). Moreover, the production of miR-9-5p was decreased in cells transfected with the pri-miR-9-1M reporter (Fig. 1E). Taken together, these results indicate that our fluorescent reporter system was able to monitor pri-miR-9-1 processing activities in an ectopically expressing DGCR8-dependent manner, as reported previously. To analyze pri-miR-9-2 processing, we similarly constructed the pri-miR-9-2 fluorescence reporter. Ectopically expressing DGCR8 promoted pri-miRNA processing activity in cells expressing pri-miR-9-2 but not in those expressing the pri-miR-9-2M reporter (Fig. 2A). Thus, we confirmed that pri-miR-9-2 processing was sensitive to the ectopic expression of both DGCR8 and pri-miR-9-1. Next, DGCR8 siRNAs were transfected into HeLa Tet-On 3G cells to reduce DGCR8 protein expression, and miR-9-5p levels were quantified. DGCR8 siRNAs effectively knocked down DGCR8 protein and reduced miR-9-5p expression levels compared with negative control siRNAs (Fig. 2B). DGCR8 siRNA also promoted tdTomato-derived fluorescence signals relative to Venus (Fig. 2C). Thus, pri-miR-9-2 reporter processing and miR-9-5p production were mediated by endogenous DGCR8. Next, we searched for human cell lines that express endogenous miR-9-5p using Daoy, U251MG, U251MG (KO), HeLa Tet-On 3G, U2OSTteOn, and HEK293TetOn3G cells. Among these, human astrocytoma U251 MG and U251 MG (KO) cells expressed high levels of miR-9-5p (Fig. 2D). Of importance, miR-9-5p expression levels in U251MG (KO) cells were suppressed by treatment with DGCR8 siRNAs (Fig. 2E), while pri-miR-9-2 was greatly increased (Fig. 2F). Hence, miR-9-5p production from endogenous pri-miR-9-2 occurred in a DGCR8-dependent manner. Similarly, Drosha siRNAs effectively knocked down Drosha cellular protein levels and promoted the accumulation of pri-miR-9-2 (Fig. 2, G and H). These findings suggest that the processing of both endogenous pri-miR-9-2 and pri-miR-9-2 fluorescent reporter depended on the canonical microprocessor complex. To evaluate the efficiency of pri-miR-9-2 processing, we carried out the fluorescent miRNA processing reporter assay with pri-miR-9-1, 9-2, and 9-3 in HeLa Tet-On 3G. Among these three reporters, the pri-miR-9-2 reporter showed a relatively high efficiency of RNA processing with or without the ectopic expression of DGCR8 (Fig. 3A). miR-9-5p production from these reporter systems was then detected (Fig. 3B), and pri-miR-9-2 processing was shown to be more sensitive to DGCR8. A twice tandem repeat of the pri-miR-9-1 and pri-miR-9-2 processing reporters, pri-miR-9-1×2 and pri-miR-9-2×2, was constructed to investigate the efficiencies of pri-miRNA processing. Pri-miR-9-1×2 responded more sensitively to DGCR8 than pri-miR-9-1 without changing Venus protein levels (Fig. 3, C and E). It is surprising that pri-miR-9-2×2 reporters showed a much greater efficiency of RNA processing than pri-miR-9-1×2 and pri-miR-9-2 without changing Venus protein levels (Fig. 3, D and F). These results suggest that DGCR8-dependent pri-miRNA processing is enhanced by pri-miR-9-2. To explore key RNA elements responsible for the promotion of pri-miR-9-2 processing, we constructed various types of deletion mutant miR-9-2 (Fig. 4A). First, deletion mutants pri-miR-9-2-200 and pri-miR-9-2-100, which lack wing regions at both ends, showed a reduction of efficiency in HeLa Tet-On 3G, suggesting that DGCR8-responsive RNA elements are located in the wing region of pri-miR-9-2. To determine which end the elements are located in, we constructed pri-miR-9-2-200-1 and pri-miR-9-2-200-2 reporters containing 3′- and 5′-end wing sequences, respectively (Fig. 4A). DGCR8 sensitivity was still reduced following the transfection of pri-miR-9-2-200-2 (Fig. 4B), but the reduction of DGCR8 sensitivity was restored with the transfection of pri-miR-9-2-200-1 (Fig. 4B). This indicated that the 3′-end wing of pri-miR-9-2 contains a critical RNA element for DGCR8 sensitivity. The deletion mutant pri-miR-9-1-100, which lacks both wing regions of pri-miR-9-1, maintained its efficient pri-miRNA processing activity in a DGCR8-dependent manner, indicating the lack of any critical element in the wing region of miR-9-1 (Fig. 4, C and D). We next performed genome alignment analysis of human pri-miR-9-2 to the sequences of 35 mammalian species from the UCSC Human Genome Browser. A highly conserved region was identified in the 3′-end wing of pri-miR-9-2, but not in the wing of pri-miR-9-1 (Fig. 4E). For example, a 50-nt RNA sequence in the 3′-end wing of pri-miR-9-2 was found to be 98% identical between humans and mice, compared with only 65.4% identity for a 50 nt RNA sequence in the 3′-end wing of pri-miR-9-1. This highly conserved region supports the idea that the 3′-end wing of pri-miR-9-2 contains a DRE. We then focused on unique sequences located in the 5′-end, 3′-end, and loop region between miR-9-5p and miR-9-3p in pri-miR-9-1-100 (Fig. 5A). To explore pri-miR-9-1-100 sequences responsible for potentiating DGCR8-dependent processing, we constructed fluorescence reporter vectors including pri-miR-9-1-100 and pri-miR-9-2-100 chimeras, pri-miR-9-1/2-102 (including pre-miR-9-1, and 5′- and 3′-ends of pri-miR-9-2-100), and pri-miR-9-1/2-98 (including pre-miR-9-2, and 5′- and 3′-ends of pri-miR-9-1-100) (Fig. 5B). Reporter analysis revealed that an RNA element containing 5′- and 3′-end sequences of pri-miR-9-1-100 showed higher DGCR8 sensitivity than pri-miR-9-2-100 (Fig. 5C). This suggested that 5′- and 3′-end sequences of pri-miR-9-1-100, but not the unique loop sequence of pre-miR-9-1, contain important elements for high sensitivity to DGCR8. Collectively, we identified novel DREs in pri-miR-9-1 and pri-miR-9-2. In pri-miR-9-1, RNA sequences close to the 5′- and 3′-ends of pre-miR-9-1 appeared to be important, whereas the 3′-end wing was important in pri-miR-9-2 (Fig. 6).Figure 6DGCR8-responsive RNA elements in human pri-miR9-1 and pri-miR9-2. DGCR8-responsive RNA elements (DREs) were identified in this study. The DRE of pri-miR-9-1 is in the vicinity of pre-miR-9-1, and the DRE of pri-miR-9-2 is in the 3’ wing region. DRE promotes pri-miR-9 processing activity in an ectopically expressed DGCR8-dependent manner.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To explore pri-miRNA candidates possessing DRE, we conducted a BLAST search using the highly conserved 50-nt RNA sequence in the 3′-end wing of pri-miR-9-2 but found no matching transcript in the human transcriptome. We performed miRNA profiling to explore DGCR8-sensitive miRNA candidates in U251 MG (KO) cells treated with DGCR8 siRNA using the nCounter Analysis system (Fig. 7A). Of importance, qRT-PCR assay confirmed accumulation of several pri-miRNAs, including pri-miR-99a, pri-miR-15a, and pri-miR-100, in both U251 MG (KO) and HeLa Tet On 3G cells treated with DGCR8 siRNAs (Fig. 7, B and C). Our reporter system also revealed that pri-miR-15a-16-1 and pri-miR-100 displayed efficient processing in an ectopically expressing DGCR8-dependent manner but that this was less efficient than the pri-miR-9-2 reporter (Fig. 7D). Schizophrenia and 22q11.2 deletion syndrome–related miRNAs, miR-17-92 cluster pri-miRNA, miR-409-412-369-410 cluster pri-miRNA, and miR-137 were also investigated (34Fénelon K. Xu B. Lai C.S.

Neurosci. 2018; 21: 1689-1703Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). miR-17-92 cluster pri-miRNA, which contains six different pre-miRNAs, and pri-miR-137 reporters showed less efficient processing than the pri-miR-9-2 reporter (Fig. 7E). The miR-409-412-369-410 cluster pri-miRNA reporter showed less efficient processing than the pri-miR-9-2×2 reporter, even though it contained four different pre-miRNAs (Fig. 7E). Among the DGCR8-sensitive miRNAs we found, the miR-99a reporter does not respond to DGCR8 expression (Fig. 7D), whereas DGCR8 knockdown upregulates pri-miR-99a and downregulates mature miR-99a (Fig. 7, A–C). Therefore, we tried to add a chimeric reporter containing the 3’ wing DRE of miR-9-2 in miR-99a reporter to test whether DGCR8 sensitivity depends on the DRE sequence. Of interest, a simple conversion of the 3’ wing region in miR-99a reporter to a DRE sequence increased DGCR8 response (Fig. 8A). On the other hand, control and miR-99a reporter did not show DGCR8 responsiveness (Figs. 8A and S2). These results strongly suggest the functional significance of DGCR8 sensitivity in the DRE sequence. Since the DRE sequence itself did not show a double-stranded structure, RNA duplex among typical pri-miRNAs (Fig. S3), we considered the involvement of RNA modification and DGCR8 sensitivity. Given that an RNA modification with N6-methyladenosine is efficiently recognized by a microprocessor complex (38Alarcón C.R. Lee H. Goodarzi H. Halberg N. Tavazoie S.F. N6-methyladenosine marks primary microRNAs for processing.Nature. 2015; 519: 482-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar), we performed a knockdown experiment of METTL3, an epi-transcriptome m6A writer enzyme in U251MG(KO) cells. Similar to previous study, we also confirmed upregulation of pri-miR-9-2 expression in METTL3 KD cells (38Alarcón C.R. Lee H. Goodarzi H. Halberg N. Tavazoie S.F.

By UV cross-linking and immunoprecipitation (CLIP)-qRT-PCR assay, we observed that the efficiency of interaction between DGCR8 and pri-miR-9-2 was decreased in METTL3 KD cells (38Alarcón C.R. Lee H.

https://openalex.org/W3126798002,"Background Functional exercise capacity assessment is recommended in children with cystic fibrosis (CF). The six-minute walk test (6MWT) is a valid evaluation of exercise capacity but can be technically complex. Inversely, the sit-to-stand test (STST) is a simple method to evaluate exercise capacity, and is validated in healthy children and adults with CF. This study aimed to evaluate STST measurement properties in children and adolescents with CF. Methods In this multicenter study, children with CF (6 to 18 years) performed two iterations of both the STST and the 6MWT in a randomized order. Criterion validity was determined by assessing correlations between STST repetitions and 6MWT distance (6MWD). Intra-rater reliability, test-retest repeatability, mean bias and limits of agreement were also assessed. Relationships with other outcomes (i.e. respiratory and quadriceps muscle strength) and cardio-respiratory responses were analysed for both tests. Results Thirty-six children with CF were included (mean age 12.0 ±3.5 years and FEV1 95.8 ±25.0%). On average, 39.6 ±10.5 repetitions were performed during the STST and mean 6MWD was 596.0 ±102.6 meters. STST number of repetitions was significantly correlated with 6MWD (r = 0.48; p&lt;0.01). Both tests had very good intra-rater reliability (ICC STST = 0.91 (95%CI 0.76–0.96) and ICC 6MWT = 0.94 (95%CI 0.85–0.97)), and a significant test-retest learning effect. The number of STST repetitions was not correlated with quadriceps or respiratory muscle strength test, and the STST induced fewer cardio-respiratory responses than the 6MWT. Conclusions The STST is an easy-to-use functional test with moderate criterion validity when compared to the 6MWT in children with CF, probably because both tests measure different components of functional exercise capacity. The STST is useful when the 6MWT is unfeasible, however further investigations are required to explore the clinical implications of STST results in children with CF.

https://openalex.org/W3126155817,"Determining the function of proteins remains a key task of modern biology. Classical genetic approaches to knocking out protein function in plants still face limitations, such as the time-consuming nature of generating homozygous transgenic lines or the risk of non-viable loss-of-function phenotypes. We aimed to overcome these limitations by acting downstream of the protein level. Chimeric E3 ligases degrade proteins of interest in mammalian cell lines, Drosophila melanogaster embryos, and transgenic tobacco. We successfully recruited the 26S proteasome pathway to directly degrade a protein of interest located in plant nuclei. This success was achieved via replacement of the interaction domain of the E3 ligase adaptor protein SPOP (Speckle-type POZ adapter protein) with a specific anti-GFP nanobody (VHHGFP4). For proof of concept, the target protein CENH3 of A . thaliana fused to EYFP was subjected to nanobody-guided proteasomal degradation in planta . Our results show the potential of the modified E3-ligase adapter protein VHHGFP4-SPOP in this respect. We were able to point out its capability for nucleus-specific protein degradation in plants."
https://openalex.org/W3126746158,"Mice lacking connexin 30 (Cx30) display increased epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) activity in the distal nephron and develop salt-sensitive hypertension. This indicates a functional link between Cx30 and ENaC, which remains incompletely understood. Here, we explore the effect of Cx30 on ENaC function using the Xenopus laevis oocyte expression system. Coexpression of human Cx30 with human αβγENaC significantly reduced ENaC-mediated whole-cell currents. The size of the inhibitory effect on ENaC depended on the expression level of Cx30 and required Cx30 ion channel activity. ENaC inhibition by Cx30 was mainly due to reduced cell surface ENaC expression resulting from enhanced ENaC retrieval without discernible effects on proteolytic channel activation and single-channel properties. ENaC retrieval from the cell surface involves the interaction of the ubiquitin ligase Nedd4-2 with PPPxY-motifs in the C-termini of ENaC. Truncating the C- termini of β- or γENaC significantly reduced the inhibitory effect of Cx30 on ENaC. In contrast, mutating the prolines belonging to the PPPxY-motif in γENaC or coexpressing a dominant-negative Xenopus Nedd4 (xNedd4-CS) did not significantly alter ENaC inhibition by Cx30. Importantly, the inhibitory effect of Cx30 on ENaC was significantly reduced by Pitstop-2, an inhibitor of clathrin-mediated endocytosis, or by mutating putative clathrin adaptor protein 2 (AP-2) recognition motifs (YxxФ) in the C termini of β- or γ-ENaC. In conclusion, our findings suggest that Cx30 inhibits ENaC by promoting channel retrieval from the plasma membrane via clathrin-dependent endocytosis. Lack of this inhibition may contribute to increased ENaC activity and salt-sensitive hypertension in mice with Cx30 deficiency.

Lack of this inhibition may contribute to increased ENaC activity and salt-sensitive hypertension in mice with Cx30 deficiency. The epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) belongs to the ENaC/degenerin family of ion channels. ENaC is a heterotrimer consisting of three homologous subunits (αβγ) (1Noreng S. Bharadwaj A. Posert R. Yoshioka C. Baconguis I. Structure of the human epithelial sodium channel by cryo-electron microscopy.Elife. 2018; 7e39340Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Each subunit consists of two transmembrane domains connected by a large extracellular loop and has short intracellular N- and C-termini. In several sodium transporting epithelia, ENaC provides the rate-limiting step for apical sodium entry (2Garty H. Palmer L.G. Epithelial sodium channels: Function, structure, and regulation.Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 359-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (995) Google Scholar). In particular, ENaC is expressed in the apical membrane of principal cells in the aldosterone-sensitive distal nephron (ASDN). This nephron segment consists of the late distal convoluted tubule (DCT2), the connecting tubule (CNT), and the collecting duct (CD). The regulation of ENaC activity in the ASDN plays a key role in fine-tuning renal sodium excretion and hence in long-term control of arterial blood pressure (3Loffing J. Korbmacher C.

Epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) and the control of blood pressure.Curr. Opin. Pharmacol. 2014; 15: 33-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). ENaC activity in the ASDN critically depends on channel abundance in the apical membrane, which is determined by the balance between channel insertion into the plasma membrane and endocytic channel retrieval (4Rossier B.C.

An essential hormonal regulator of ENaC activity in the ASDN is the mineralocorticoid aldosterone, but aldosterone-dependent and -independent ENaC regulation has been described in mouse distal nephron (8Nesterov V.

Heart Assoc. 2020; 9e014996Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). The mechanisms involved in mediating the stimulatory effect of aldosterone on ENaC are highly complex and probably include increased forward trafficking of ENaC (11Frindt G. Gravotta D. Palmer L.G.

There is good evidence that phosphorylation of the ubiquitin-protein ligase Nedd4-2 by serum and glucocorticoid-induced kinase 1 (Sgk1) mediates at least in part the stimulatory effect of aldosterone (13Debonneville C.

Sgk1 is stimulated by aldosterone, and phosphorylation of Nedd4-2 by Sgk1 reduces the affinity of the PPPxY-motif to Nedd4-2, which attenuates channel retrieval from the cell surface, thereby increasing channel surface expression (5Snyder P.M.

The mechanisms by which Nedd4-2-dependent ubiquitination promotes ENaC internalization are not yet fully understood, but probably include clathrin-mediated endocytosis (22Shimkets R.A. Lifton R.P.

Epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) is multi-ubiquitinated at the cell surface.Biochem. J. 2007; 405: 147-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that epsin, which has both ubiquitin-interacting and clathrin-binding motifs, may serve as a link between ubiquitinated ENaC subunits and the clathrin-dependent endocytic machinery (23Wang H. Traub L.M. Weixel K.M. Hawryluk M.J. Shah N. Edinger R.S. Perry C.J. Kester L. Butterworth M.B. Peters K.W. Kleyman T.R. Frizzell R.A. Johnson J.P.

Additionally, clathrin-interacting proteins may directly bind ENaC and induce ENaC internalization. In particular, it has been shown that ENaC interacts with the μ-subunit of the clathrin adaptor protein 2 (AP-2) (23Wang H. Traub L.M. Weixel K.M. Hawryluk M.J. Shah N. Edinger R.S. Perry C.J.

Epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) is multi-ubiquitinated at the cell surface.Biochem. J. 2007; 405: 147-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). AP2 is a multisubunit complex formed of α, β, μ, and σ-subunits, which functions as a major hub in clathrin-mediated endocytosis binding clathrin itself and a plethora of accessory and cargo proteins (25Motley A. Bright N.A. Seaman M.N.J. Robinson M.S. Clathrin-mediated endocytosis in AP-2-depleted cells.J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 909-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar, 26Traub L.M.

Molecular mechanism and physiological functions of clathrin-mediated endocytosis.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2011; 12: 517-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (1321) Google Scholar). It has been shown that μAP2 initiates clathrin-mediated endocytosis by binding to a YxxΦ-motif present in numerous transmembrane proteins (26Traub L.M. Tickets to ride: Selecting cargo for clathrin-regulated internalization.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2009; 10: 583-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar, 28Owen D.J. Evans P.R.

Signals for sorting of transmembrane proteins to endosomes and lysosomes.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 395-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (1558) Google Scholar). Interestingly, C-termini of all three ENaC subunits contain YxxΦ-motifs, which partially overlap with the PPPxY motifs. It has been proposed that ENaC is regulated by two independent retrieval pathways, one involving Nedd4-2 and the other depending on μAP2 as key component (30Staruschenko A. Pochynyuk O. Stockand J.D. Regulation of epithelial Na+ channel activity by conserved serine/threonine switches within sorting signals.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 39161-39167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). However, the functional role of the YxxΦ internalization motif in ENaC endocytosis remains to be elucidated. In addition to aldosterone and several other hormones, numerous extracellular and intracellular factors including regulatory proteins can modulate ENaC activity in the ASDN. They include proteases, which activate ENaC by cleaving the channel at specific sites in the extracellular domains of the α- and γ-subunit. This releases inhibitory domains and probably causes a conformational change leading to channel activation (31Kleyman T.R. Kashlan O.B. Hughey R.P.

Interestingly, connexin 30 (Cx30) hemichannels have been suggested as putative ENaC modulators in the distal nephron (33McCulloch F. Chambrey R. Eladari D. Peti-Peterdi J.

Acta. 2012; 1818: 1903-1908Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The canonical function of connexins is the formation of gap junctions (GJ) between adjacent cells (38Evans W.H. Martin P.E.M. Gap junctions: Structure and function (review).Mol. Membr. Biol. 2002; 19: 121-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar, 39Söhl G. Willecke K.

Every GJ consists of two docked connexons providing electrical coupling and exchange of signaling molecules between adjacent cells. Connexin hemichannels may also play a physiological role in autocrine and/or paracrine signaling (40Harris A.L. Emerging issues of connexin channels: Biophysics fills the gap.Q. Rev.

It has been shown that various signaling molecules such as ATP, NAD+, glutathione, glutamate, PGE2, or polyamines can be released through connexin hemichannels (43Kar R. Batra N.

Physiol. 2003; 553: 95-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The connexin family consists of about 20 members in mammals (46Willecke K. Eiberger J. Degen J. Eckardt D. Romualdi A. Güldenagel M. Deutsch U. Söhl G. Structural and functional diversity of connexin genes in the mouse and human genome.Biol. Chem. 2002; 383: 725-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (967) Google Scholar). Among them, Cx26, Cx30, Cx30.3, Cx37, Cx43 are differentially expressed in various parts of the nephron (35Hanner F. Sorensen C.M. Holstein-Rathlou N.H. Peti-Peterdi J. Connexins and the kidney.Am.

Acta. 2012; 1818: 1903-1908Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Importantly, Cx30 is expressed in the apical membrane of distal tubular epithelial cells in rodents suggesting that it may function there as a hemichannel (33McCulloch F. Chambrey R. Eladari D. Peti-Peterdi J. Localization of connexin 30 in the luminal membrane of cells in the distal nephron.Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2005; 289: F1304-F1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Apical Cx30 expression in the distal tubule was found to be upregulated by high-salt diet suggesting that Cx30 may be involved in the regulation of salt absorption in the distal nephron (33McCulloch F. Chambrey R. Eladari D. Peti-Peterdi J. Localization of connexin 30 in the luminal membrane of cells in the distal nephron.Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2005; 289: F1304-F1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Further studies supported this hypothesis. Cx30 knockout mice demonstrated impaired pressure natriuresis and salt-sensitive hypertension, which can be prevented by the ENaC inhibitor benzamil. This supports the hypothesis that Cx30 and ENaC may functionally interact in the distal nephron (34Sipos A. Vargas S.L. Toma I. Hanner F. Willecke K. Peti-Peterdi J. Connexin 30 deficiency impairs renal tubular ATP release and pressure natriuresis.J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2009; 20: 1724-1732Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Indeed, it has been shown that the open probability of ENaC and the number of active channels were increased in CCD of Cx30−/− mice compared with wild-type mice (36Mironova E. Peti-Peterdi J. Bugaj V. Stockand J.D. Diminished paracrine regulation of the epithelial Na+ channel by purinergic signaling in mice lacking connexin 30.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 1054-1060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). This may be due to a tonic inhibitory effect of Cx30 on ENaC possibly mediated by ATP release and purinergic signaling (47Svenningsen P. Burford J.L. Peti-Peterdi J. ATP releasing connexin 30 hemichannels mediate flow-induced calcium signaling in the collecting duct.Front. Physiol. 2013; 4: 292Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Absence of this tonic inhibition in Cx30−/− mice is thought to be responsible for increased ENaC activity. We hypothesized that additional molecular mechanisms may be involved in mediating the inhibitory effect of Cx30 on ENaC. The aim of this study was to investigate this further and to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of ENaC inhibition by Cx30 using the Xenopus laevis oocyte expression system. In a first set of experiments, we established the functional expression of human Cx30 in X. laevis oocytes. It has been reported that connexin hemichannels are inhibited by divalent cations (Ca2+, Mg2+) from the extracellular side (40Harris A.L.

Therefore, we hypothesized that currents mediated by heterologously expressed Cx30 hemichannels may be revealed by removing divalent cations from the bath solution to disinhibit the channels. To test this, it was necessary to silence interfering endogenous connexin 38 (Cx38) hemichannels known to be expressed at the cell surface of X. laevis oocytes and to be activated by removal of extracellular Ca2+ and Mg2+ (50Bahima L. Aleu J. Elias M. Martin-Satue M. Muhaisen A. Blasi J. Marsal J. Solsona C. Endogenous hemichannels play a role in the release of ATP from Xenopus oocytes.J.

As expected, concomitant removal of Ca2+ and Mg2+ from the bath solution reversibly stimulated inward whole-cell currents (ΔICa2+Mg2+-Removal) in noninjected oocytes confirming endogenous expression of functional Cx38 hemichannels (Fig. 1A, upper panels). It has been reported that endogenous expression of Cx38 in oocytes can be efficiently suppressed by antisense oligoDNA (AS Cx38) (50Bahima L. Aleu J. Elias M. Martin-Satue M. Muhaisen A. Blasi J.

J. 1996; 71: 742-748Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (see Experimental procedures). Using this established approach, we confirmed that in oocytes injected with AS Cx38, no inward currents were detectable upon Ca2+ and Mg2+ removal (Fig. 1A, middle panels). In contrast, in oocytes coinjected with AS Cx38 and cRNA for human Cx30, removal of Ca2+ and Mg2+ from the bath solution activated large inward currents consistent with the functional expression of Cx30 hemichannels at the cell surface (Fig. 1A, lower panels). Readdition of Ca2+ and Mg2+ rapidly returned the stimulated currents back to baseline. This inhibitory effect of Ca2+ and Mg2+ was usually preceded by a brief and variable inward current peak (Fig. 1A, left lower panel; Fig. 3A) probably due to a transient stimulation of Ca2+-activated chloride channels known to be endogenously expressed in oocytes (53Durieux M.E. Salafranca M.N. Lynch K.R. Trypsin induces Ca2+-activated Cl- currents in X. laevis oocytes.FEBS Lett. 1994; 337: 235-238Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). On average, inward currents elicited by Ca2+ and Mg2+ removal were not detectable in AS Cx38 injected control oocytes and were much higher in oocytes coinjected with AS Cx38 and cRNA for human Cx30 than those in noninjected oocytes expressing endogenous Cx38 (Fig. 1B). Thus, these initial experiments confirmed that endogenous Cx38 can be suppressed efficiently with AS Cx38. Moreover, they demonstrate that the oocyte system is suitable for heterologously expressing functional Cx30 hemichannels, which are present at the cell surface and can be activated by removing divalent cations from the bath solution. Interestingly, in the presence of divalent cations, baseline inward currents were significantly higher in oocytes coinjected with Cx30 cRNA and AS Cx38 than those in noninjected or AS Cx38-injected oocytes (Fig. 1C). This finding suggests that Cx30 hemichannels are not fully blocked in the presence of physiological concentrations of Ca2+ (1.8 mM) and Mg2+ (1 mM) in the extracellular solution but exhibit a small residual channel activity under these conditions. To investigate whether these baseline inward currents in Cx30 expressing oocytes are carried by Na+, we substituted Na+ in the bath solution with the large organic cation NMDG+. In Cx30 expressing oocytes (coinjected with AS Cx38), the baseline inward currents at a holding potential of −60 mV were significantly reduced by replacing Na+ with NMDG+ (Fig. 2A). This indicates that the current is mainly carried by Na+ as expected for a Cx30-mediated current. This is further supported by the leftward shift of the reversal potential from −15.3 ± 0.7 to −35.1 ± 0.8 mV (p < 0.001) observed upon switching from Na+ to NMDG+ in the bath solution (Fig. 2C). In contrast, in control oocytes without Cx30 (but injected with AS Cx38), replacing Na+ by NMDG+ had almost no effect on the magnitude of baseline inward currents (Fig. 2, B and D). Analysis of the reversal potential shifts upon switching from Na+ to NMDG+-containing solution in control oocytes revealed a marginal leftward shift from −30.4 ± 0.6 mV to −35.2 ± 0.7 mV (p < 0.001; Fig. 2D). The magnitude of this shift was significantly smaller than that observed in oocytes expressing Cx30 (−4.8 ± 0.6 in control oocytes versus −19.8 ± 0.9 mV in Cx30-expressing oocytes; p < 0.001). This indicates that the Na+ conductance of control oocytes is negligible. Thus, expression of Cx30 leads to a significant increase of a baseline cation conductance in oocytes. To estimate the cation permeability ratio (PNa:PNMDG) for Cx30, we had to correct for the contribution of endogenous oocyte channels to the observed currents. Therefor"

The rate of water loss and saltwater tolerance thus determine the ability to disperse over sea and further influence species distribution. Surprisingly, this association between physiology and ecology is rarely investigated in terrestrial vertebrates. Here we conducted immersion experiments to individuals and eggs of six lizard species differently distributed across Taiwan and the adjacent islands to understand if the physiological responses reflect the geographical distribution. We found that Plestiodon elegans had the highest rate of water loss and the lowest saltwater tolerance, whereas Eutropis longicaudata and E . multifasciata showed the lowest rate of water loss and the highest saltwater tolerance. Diploderma swinhonis , Hemidactylus frenatus , and Anolis sagrei had medium measurements. For the eggs, only the rigid-shelled eggs of H . frenatus were incubated successfully after treatments. While, the parchment-shelled eggs of E . longicaudata and D . swinhonis lost or gained water dramatically in the immersions without any successful incubation. Combined with the historical geology of the islands and the origin areas of each species, the inferences of the results largely explain the current distribution of these lizards across Taiwan and the adjacent islands, pioneerly showing the association between physiological capability and species distribution."
https://openalex.org/W3129484588,"Proper expression of Homeobox A cluster genes (HoxA) is essential for embryonic stem cell (ESC) differentiation and individual development. However, mechanisms controlling precise spatiotemporal expression of HoxA during early ESC differentiation remain poorly understood. Herein, we identified a functional CTCF-binding element (CBE+47) closest to the 3'-end of HoxA within the same topologically associated domain (TAD) in ESC. CRISPR-Cas9-mediated deletion of CBE+47 significantly upregulated HoxA expression and enhanced early ESC differentiation induced by retinoic acid (RA) relative to wild-type cells. Mechanistic analysis by chromosome conformation capture assay (Capture-C) revealed that CBE+47 deletion decreased interactions between adjacent enhancers, enabling formation of a relatively loose enhancer-enhancer interaction complex (EEIC), which overall increased interactions between that EEIC and central regions of HoxA chromatin. These findings indicate that CBE+47 organizes chromatin interactions between its adjacent enhancers and HoxA. Furthermore, deletion of those adjacent enhancers synergistically inhibited HoxA activation, suggesting that these enhancers serve as an EEIC required for RA-induced HoxA activation. Collectively, these results provide new insight into RA-induced HoxA expression during early ESC differentiation, also highlight precise regulatory roles of the CTCF-binding element in orchestrating high-order chromatin structure."
https://openalex.org/W3127249252,"Introduction High participation in epidemiological studies is crucial for both external and internal validity. Because response rates have declined in recent years, there is an increasing need to understand the drivers and the barriers to research participation. This study aims to uncover the motivations in favour and against participation of older adults to an epidemiological study on health and dementia. Methods Twenty-two older adults, who already took part to the preliminary phase of an epidemiological study in Switzerland, agreed to participate to semi-structured, face-to- face interviews. An experienced researcher carried out all interviews in a quiet place of choice of the interviewee either at their domicile or the university, between November 2019 and January 2020. The interviews were audio and video taped, transcribed verbatim, and thematically analysed by two independent researchers. Results We identified three main themes for the motivations in favour of participation (i.e. personal, related to the outcomes of research, and altruistic motivations), and we highlighted subthemes for each theme (e.g. personal motivations: curiosity; civic engagement; interest in the topic; trust in science; everyone counts; openness; play the game). Motivations against participation reflected the first two themes, while there was no counterpart for altruistic motivations. Conclusions Our thematic analysis revealed that older adults hold specular motivations in favour and against participation to research. Studying jointly motivations in favour and against provides information for recruitment strategies and to overcome barriers to participation, respectively. Participatory action research can inform the design and conduction of and should precede epidemiological studies in older adults, and can potentially contribute to attain high response rates."
https://openalex.org/W3127443334,"Introduction Ultrasonography is widely used as the first tool to evaluate fatty liver disease, and the hepatorenal index is a semi-quantitative method that improves its performance. Fibrosis can co-exist with steatosis or even replace it during disease progression. This study aimed to evaluate the influence of fibrosis on the measurement of steatosis using the hepatorenal index. Materials and methods This cross-sectional study included 89 patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and in whom liver fibrosis was determined by ultrasound elastography. The Pearson’s correlation coefficient was used to compare between the results of the sonographic hepatorenal index and the quantification of steatosis using magnetic resonance spectroscopy as well the accuracy of detecting moderate to severe steatosis using sonography in two groups of patients: (A) without advanced fibrosis and (B) with advanced fibrosis. Advanced fibrosis was defined as a shear wave speed ≥ 1.78 m/s on ultrasound elastography. We calculated the area under the curve (AUC-ROC) to detect the ability of the hepatorenal index to differentiate light from moderate to severe steatosis in both groups. Moderate to severe steatosis was defined as a fat fraction &gt; 15% on the magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The intra-observer variability was assessed using the Bland-Altman plot. Results Among patients, the mean age was 54.6 years and 59.6% were women, 50.6% had a body mass index ≥ 30 kg/m 2 , 29.2% had moderate to severe steatosis, and 27.2% had advanced fibrosis. There was a correlation between steatosis grading by ultrasonography and magnetic resonance in group A (0.73; P &lt; 0.001), but not in Group B (0.33; P = 0.058). The AUC-ROC for detecting a steatosis fraction ≥ 15% was 0.90 and 0.74 in group A and group B, respectively. The intra-observer variability for the hepatorenal index measurements was not significant (-0.036; P = 0.242). Conclusion The hepatorenal index is not appropriate for estimating steatosis in livers with advanced fibrosis."
https://openalex.org/W3128576022,"Female genital mutilation/cutting (FGM/C) is considered a public health and human rights concern, mainly concentrated in Africa, and has been targeted for elimination under the sustainable development goals. Interventions aimed at ending the practice often rely on data from household surveys which employ complex designs leading to outcomes that are not totally independent, thus requiring advanced statistical techniques. Combining data from multiple surveys within robust statistical framework holds promise to provide more precise estimates due to increased sample size, and accurately identify ‘hotspots’ and allow for assessment of changes over time. In this study, rich datasets from six (6) successive waves of the Nigeria Demographic and Health Surveys and Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys undertaken between 2003 and 2016/17, were combined and analyzed in order to better assess changes in the likelihood and prevalence of FGM/C among 0-14-year old girls in Nigeria. We used Bayesian hierarchical regression models which explicitly accounted for the inherent spatial and temporal autocorrelations within the data while simultaneously adjusting for variations due to different survey methods and the effects of linear and non-linear covariates. Parameters were estimated using Markov chain Mote Carlo techniques and model fit assessments were based on Deviance Information Criterion. Results show that prevalence of FGM/C among 0–14 years old girls in Nigeria varied over time and across geographical locations and peaked in 2008 with a shift from South to North. A girl was more likely to be cut if her mother was cut, supported FGM/C continuation, or had no higher education. The effects of mother’s age, wealth and type of residence (urban-rural) were no longer significant in 2016. These results reflect the gains of interventions over the years, but also echo the belief that FGM/C is a social norm thus requiring tailored all-inclusive interventions for the total abandonment of FGM/C in Nigeria."
https://openalex.org/W3131928940,"Sirtuin 6 (Sirt6), a member of the Sirtuin family, has important roles in maintaining glucose and lipid metabolism. Our previous studies demonstrated that the deletion of Sirt6 in pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC)-expressing cells by the loxP-Cre system resulted in severe obesity and hepatic steatosis. However, whether overexpression of Sirt6 in hypothalamic POMC neurons could ameliorate diet-induced obesity is still unknown. Thus, we generated mice specifically overexpressing Sirt6 in hypothalamic POMC neurons (PSOE) by stereotaxic injection of Cre-dependent adeno-associated viruses into the arcuate nucleus of Pomc-Cre mice. PSOE mice showed increased adiposity and decreased energy expenditure. Furthermore, thermogenesis of BAT and lipolysis of WAT were both impaired, caused by reduced sympathetic nerve innervation and activity in adipose tissues. Mechanistically, Sirt6 overexpression decreasing STAT3 acetylation, thus lowering POMC expression in the hypothalamus underlined the observed phenotypes in PSOE mice. These results demonstrate that Sirt6 overexpression specifically in the hypothalamic POMC neurons exacerbates diet-induced obesity and metabolic disorders via the hypothalamus-adipose axis."
https://openalex.org/W3127585871,"Chronic ethanol consumption is a risk factor for colorectal cancer, and ethanol-induced reactive oxygen species have been suggested to play important roles in the pathogenesis of ethanol-related colorectal cancer (ER-CRC). In this study, the effects of 10-week chronic administration of ethanol on the colonic levels of oxidative stress and advance glycation end product (AGE) levels, as well as fecal microbiota structures, were examined in a mouse model. Chronic oral administration of ethanol in mice (1.0 mL of 1.5% or 5.0% ethanol (v/v) per day per mouse, up to 10 weeks) resulted in the elevation of colonic levels of oxidative stress markers (such as 8-hydroxy-2’-deoxyguanosine and 4-hydroxynonenal) compared to control mice, and this was consistently accompanied by elevated levels of inflammation-associated cytokines and immune cells (Th17 and macrophages) and a decreased level of regulatory T (Treg) cells to produce colonic lesions. It also resulted in an alteration of mouse fecal microbiota structures, reminiscent of the alterations observed in human inflammatory bowel disease, and this appeared to be consistent with the proposed sustained generation of oxidative stress in the colonic environment during chronic ethanol consumption. Moreover, the first experimental evidence that chronic ethanol administration results in elevated levels of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) and their receptors (RAGE) in the colonic tissues in mice is also shown, implying enhanced RAGE-mediated signaling with chronic ethanol administration. The RAGE-mediated signaling pathway has thus far been implicated as a link between the accumulation of AGEs and the development of many types of chronic colitis and cancers. Thus, enhancement of this pathway likely exacerbates the ethanol-induced inflammatory states of colonic tissues and might at least partly contribute to the pathogenesis of ER-CRC."
https://openalex.org/W3128311984,"Background During pneumonia, normal alveolar areas coexist adjacently with consolidated areas, and high inspiratory efforts may predispose to lung damage. To date, no study has evaluated different degrees of effort during Biphasic positive airway pressure (BIVENT) on lung and diaphragm damage in experimental pneumonia, though largely used in clinical setting. We aimed to evaluate lung damage, genes associated with ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) and diaphragmatic injury, and blood bacteria in pressure-support ventilation (PSV), BIVENT with low and high inspiratory efforts in experimental pneumonia. Material and methods Twenty-eight male Wistar rats (mean ± SD weight, 333±78g) were submitted Pseudomonas aeruginosa -induced pneumonia. After 24-h, animals were ventilated for 1h in: 1) PSV; 2) BIVENT with low (BIVENT Low-Effort ); and 3) BIVENT with high inspiratory effort (BIVENT High-Effort ). BIVENT was set at P high to achieve V T = 6 ml/kg and P low at 5 cmH 2 O (n = 7/group). High- and low-effort conditions were obtained through anaesthetic infusion modulation based on neuromuscular drive (P 0.1 ). Lung mechanics, histological damage score, blood bacteria, and expression of genes related to VILI in lung tissue, and inflammation in diaphragm tissue. Results Transpulmonary peak pressure and histological damage score were higher in BIVENT High-Effort compared to BIVENT Low-Effort and PSV [16.1 ± 1.9cmH 2 O vs 12.8 ± 1.5cmH 2 O and 12.5 ± 1.6cmH 2 O, p = 0.015, and p = 0.010; median (interquartile range) 11 (9–13) vs 7 (6–9) and 7 (6–9), p = 0.021, and p = 0.029, respectively]. BIVENT High-Effort increased interleukin-6 expression compared to BIVENT Low-Effort (p = 0.035) as well as expressions of cytokine-induced neutrophil chemoattractant-1, amphiregulin, and type III procollagen compared to PSV (p = 0.001, p = 0.001, p = 0.004, respectively). Tumour necrosis factor-α expression in diaphragm tissue and blood bacteria were higher in BIVENT High-Effort than BIVENT Low-Effort (p = 0.002, p = 0.009, respectively). Conclusion BIVENT requires careful control of inspiratory effort to avoid lung and diaphragm damage, as well as blood bacteria. P 0.1 might be considered a helpful parameter to optimize inspiratory effort."
https://openalex.org/W3129713250,"The glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) is a type III intermediate filament (IF) protein that is highly expressed in astrocytes, neural stem cells, and in gliomas. Gliomas are a heterogeneous group of primary brain tumors that arise from glia cells or neural stem cells and rely on accurate diagnosis for prognosis and treatment strategies. GFAP is differentially expressed between glioma subtypes and, therefore, often used as a diagnostic marker. However, GFAP is highly regulated by the process of alternative splicing; many different isoforms have been identified. Differential expression of GFAP isoforms between glioma subtypes suggests that GFAP isoform-specific analyses could benefit diagnostics. In this study we report on the differential expression of a new GFAP isoform between glioma subtypes, GFAPµ. A short GFAP transcript resulting from GFAP exon 2 skipping was detected by RNA sequencing of human glioma. We show that GFAPµ mRNA is expressed in healthy brain tissue, glioma cell lines, and primary glioma cells and that it translates into a ~21 kDa GFAP protein. 21 kDa GFAP protein was detected in the IF protein fraction isolated from human spinal cord as well. We further show that induced GFAPµ expression disrupts the GFAP IF network. The characterization of this new GFAP isoform adds on to the numerous previously identified GFAP splice isoforms. It emphasizes the importance of studying the contribution of IF splice variants to specialized functions of the IF network and to glioma research."
https://openalex.org/W3127586217,"Ariadne-1 (Ari-1) is an E3 ubiquitin-ligase essential for neuronal development, but whose neuronal substrates are yet to be identified. To search for putative Ari-1 substrates, we used an in vivo ubiquitin biotinylation strategy coupled to quantitative proteomics of Drosophila heads. We identified 16 candidates that met the established criteria: a significant change of at least twofold increase on ubiquitination, with at least two unique peptides identified. Among those candidates, we identified Comatose (Comt), the homologue of the N-ethylmaleimide sensitive factor (NSF), which is involved in neurotransmitter release. Using a pull-down approach that relies on the overexpression and stringent isolation of a GFP-fused construct, we validate Comt/NSF to be an ubiquitination substrate of Ari-1 in fly neurons, resulting in the preferential monoubiquitination of Comt/NSF. We tested the possible functional relevance of this modification using Ari-1 loss-of-function mutants, which displayed a lower rate of spontaneous neurotransmitter release due to failures at the presynaptic side. By contrast, evoked release in Ari-1 mutants was enhanced compared with controls in a Ca2+-dependent manner without modifications in the number of active zones, indicating that the probability of release per synapse is increased in these mutants. This phenotype distinction between spontaneous and evoked release suggests that NSF activity may discriminate between these two types of vesicle fusion. Our results thus provide a mechanism to regulate NSF activity in the synapse through Ari-1-dependent ubiquitination.

This phenotype distinction between spontaneous and evoked release suggests that NSF activity may discriminate between these two types of vesicle fusion. Our results thus provide a mechanism to regulate NSF activity in the synapse through Ari-1-dependent ubiquitination. Neurotransmitter release is mediated by a set of protein–protein interactions that include the N-ethylmaleimide sensitive factor (NSF), soluble NSF attachment proteins (SNAPs), and SNAP receptors (SNAREs) (1Söllner T. Whiteheart S.W. Brunner M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Geromanos S. Tempst P. Rothman J.E. SNAP receptors implicated in vesicle targeting and fusion.Nature. 1993; 362: 318-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (2570) Google Scholar). These proteins assemble into a tripartite complex in order to elicit synaptic vesicle fusion, which is formed by one synaptic vesicle membrane SNARE protein (v-SNARE), Synaptobrevin, and two plasma membrane SNARE proteins (t-SNAREs), Syntaxin and the 25-kDa synaptosome-associated protein (2Jahn R. Scheller R.H. SNAREs--engines for membrane fusion.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 631-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (1800) Google Scholar). Following vesicle fusion, the tripartite SNARE complex disassembles by the activities of NSF and SNAPs (3Littleton J.T. A genomic analysis of membrane trafficking and neurotransmitter release in Drosophila.J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: F77-F82Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Free t-SNAREs from the plasma membrane can then participate in new priming reactions, while the v-SNAREs can be incorporated into recycled synaptic vesicles (4Südhof T.C. Neurotransmitter release: The last millisecond in the life of a synaptic vesicle.Neuron. 2013; 80: 675-690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar). These interactions, also routinely used for intracellular vesicle trafficking in all cell types, are conserved across species, including Drosophila (5Yu W. Kawasaki F. Ordway R.W. Activity-dependent interactions of NSF and SNAP at living synapses.Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2011; 47: 19-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Deviations on the rate of neurotransmitter release are at the origin of multiple neural diseases, including Parkinson's disease (6Bridi J.C. Hirth F. Mechanisms of α-synuclein induced synaptopathy in Parkinson's disease.Front. Neurosci. 2018; 12: 80Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Under physiological conditions, the Leucine-rich repeat Serine/Threonine-protein kinase 2 (LRRK2) phosphorylates NSF to enhance its ATPase activity, which facilitates the disassembly of the SNARE complex (7Shin N.

LRRK2 controls synaptic vesicle storage and mobilization within the recycling pool.J. Neurosci. 2011; 31: 2225-2237Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Similarly, α-Synuclein, another Parkinson's disease protein (12Burré J. Sharma M. Südhof T.C. Cell biology and pathophysiology of α-synuclein.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Med. 2018; 8a024091Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), alters neurotransmitter release by preventing the v-SNARE vesicle-associated membrane protein (VAMP)-2, also known as Synaptobrevin-2, from joining the SNARE complex cycle (13Wang C.

Correct neural functioning, therefore, requires delicate regulation in vesicle trafficking. This regulation can be achieved by posttranslational modifications, such as ubiquitination. In fact, ubiquitination of certain proteins can affect their activity or life span (14Hallengren J. Chen P.-C. Wilson S.M. Neuronal ubiquitin homeostasis.Cell Biochem.

At the presynaptic side, for example, increased neurotransmitter release correlates with decreased protein ubiquitination (16Rinetti G.V. Schweizer F.E. Ubiquitination acutely regulates presynaptic neurotransmitter release in mammalian neurons.J. Neurosci. 2010; 30: 3157-3166Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar).

However, despite its importance, no neuronal substrates have been reported so far. Only three Ari-1 substrates have been postulated, either in cultured cells or in vitro (20Tan N.G.S. Ardley H.C.

For this reason, with the aim to identify neuronal Ari-1 substrates, we took advantage of two methodologies developed by our lab (24Ramirez J. Elu N. Martinez A. Lectez B. Mayor U.

Neuromethods, Humana Press, New York, NY2017: 179-189Crossref Scopus (2) Google Scholar). The first one, the bioUb strategy, allows the identification of hundreds of ubiquitinated proteins from neuronal tissues (25Franco M. Seyfried N.T. Brand A.H. Peng J. Mayor U.

The system relies on the overexpression of a tagged ubiquitin that bears a 16 amino acid long biotinylatable peptide (25Franco M. Seyfried N.T. Brand A.H. Peng J. Mayor U.

Remarkably, this approach can be efficiently applied to identify neuronal E3 ligase substrates (28Martinez A. Lectez B. Ramirez J. Popp O. Sutherland J.D. Urbé S. Dittmar G. Clague M.J. Mayor U.

Genet. 2018; 27: 1955-1971Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The second methodology, in contrast, favors the isolation of GFP-tagged proteins under denaturing conditions to further characterize their ubiquitination pattern under the presence or absence of an E3 ligase (30Lee S.Y.

Detailed dissection of UBE3A-mediated DDI1 ubiquitination.Front. Physiol. 2019; 10: 534Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Here we have combined the bioUb strategy with the overexpression of Ari-1 and identified 16 putative neuronal substrates of Ari-1. Among those, we focused on Comatose (Comt), the fly NSF orthologue (32Ordway R.W. Pallanck L. Ganetzky B. Neurally expressed Drosophila genes encoding homologs of the NSF and SNAP secretory proteins.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5715-5719Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), due to its relevance in normal and pathological function at the synapse. By the isolation of GFP-tagged Comt from Drosophila photoreceptor neurons overexpressing Ari-1, we confirmed Comt/NSF as an Ari-1 ubiquitin substrate and showed that it is mostly monoubiquitinated. Furthermore, we reported that Ari-1 loss-of-function mutants displayed lower rate of spontaneous neurotransmitter release, but enhanced evoked release, due to failures at the presynaptic side. These defects in the mutants are compatible with a deregulation of Com/NSF activity. Altogether, our data show that Ari-1 regulates neurotransmitter release by controlling Comt/NSF activity through ubiquitination. We generated GMR-Gal4, UAS-(bioUb)6-BirA/CyO; UAS-ari-1/TM6 flies (hereinafter ari-1OE flies, from Ari-1 overexpression) in order to screen, in an unbiased manner, for putative substrates of the E3 ligase Ari-1. These flies overexpress in photoreceptor neurons (using the GMR-Gal4 driver) both an untagged version of Ari-1 protein (Fig. 1A) and the (bioUb)6-BirA construct (Fig. 1B), which is the one that provides the biotinylatable ubiquitins and the BirA enzyme to the system. The rationale for using GMR-Gal4 is that it has been shown to be a suitable driver for ubiquitin proteomics experiments from mature neurons, in comparison with other neuronal drivers tested (26Ramirez J. Martinez A. Lectez B. Lee S.Y. Franco M. Barrio R. Dittmar G. Mayor U. Proteomic analysis of the ubiquitin landscape in the Drosophila embryonic nervous system and the adult photoreceptor cells.PLoS One. 2015; 10e0139083Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Flies only overexpressing the (bioUb)6-BirA construct in photoreceptor neurons were used as control. Overall, expression levels of biotinylated ubiquitin were similar in both genotypes, as indicated by a western blot performed with biotin antibody using whole head extracts (see input fraction of Fig. 1C). Similarly, the amount of ubiquitinated material eluted from biotin pull-downs on both fly lines was also similar (see elution fraction of Fig. 1C). Higher levels of Ari-1 enzyme in ari-1OE flies should result in an enhanced ubiquitination of Ari-1 substrates relative to control flies. Therefore, quantitative proteomic experiments were carried out, following a previously described workflow (28Martinez A. Lectez B. Ramirez J. Popp O. Sutherland J.D. Urbé S. Dittmar G. Clague M.J. Mayor U. Quantitative proteomic analysis of Parkin substrates in Drosophila neurons.Mol. Neurodegener. 2017; 12: 29Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 29Ramirez J. Lectez B. Osinalde N.

Genet. 2018; 27: 1955-1971Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), to decipher the ubiquitinated proteome from both ari-1OE and control flies and, hence, detect those proteins whose ubiquitination is regulated by Ari-1. In brief, we collected 500 mg of heads of each fly genotype and subjected triplicate samples to biotin pulldown and liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis. This allowed us to isolate, detect, and quantify ubiquitinated proteins present in fly photoreceptor neurons expressing physiological (control samples) and high (ari-1OE samples) levels of Ari-1 (Fig. 1D). Only those proteins with at least a twofold enrichment, determined with a p-value < 0.05, in ari-1OE samples were considered as putative Ari-1 substrates (Fig. 2A). Biotin pull-downs were performed on three biological replicates for each condition. Identified ubiquitinated proteins were highly reproducible across the three replicate samples of each condition and also between both conditions (Fig. 2B). Protein abundance was determined using label-free quantification (LFQ) intensities (33Cox J. Hein M.Y. Luber C.A. Paron I. Nagaraj N. Mann M. Accurate proteome-wide label-free quantification by delayed Normalization and maximal peptide ratio extraction, termed MaxLFQ.Mol. Cell Proteomics. 2014; 13: 2513-2526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2313) Google Scholar), which also displayed a high correlation across samples (Pearson correlation ≥ 0.96). For statistical analysis, missing LFQ values were imputed with low random values from a normal distribution, meant to simulate expression levels below the detection limit. It should be noted that proteins with too many imputed LFQ values were discarded from the Ari-1 putative substrate list. Only proteins with LFQ values in at least the three replicas of one of the conditions, either ari-1OE or control, or in at least two replicas of both conditions, are labeled in Figure 3. Ari-1 protein was found significantly enriched (p = 0.0000176) in ari-1OE samples relative to control flies (Ari-1, ari-1OE/control LFQ ratio of 26.1) (Fig. 3). By contrast, and in agreement with western blotting results (Fig. 1C), ubiquitin levels were similar in both conditions (Ub, ari-1OE/control LFQ ratio of 0.73) (Fig. 3). The relative abundance of the majority of proteins quantified did not change significantly either; this included Avidin (AVD) and proteins known to be endogenously conjugated with biotin (ACC: acetyl-CoA carboxylase, PCB: pyruvate carboxylase) (25Franco M. Seyfried N.T. Brand A.H. Peng J. Mayor U. A novel strategy to isolate ubiquitin conjugates reveals wide role for ubiquitination during neural development.Mol.

J. 1985; 232: 385-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), which serve as internal controls to determine the correct processing of the biotin pull-downs (Fig. 3, marked in blue). Out of the 1452 proteins quantified (see control versus ari-1OE Venn diagram in Fig. 2B, and Table S1), 22 proteins were found significantly enriched (p-value < 0.05) by at least twofold (log2 fold change >1) in ari-1OE flies relative to control flies (Fig. 3, marked in green), including the Ari-1 E3 ligase itself. Two proteins, Mdg3/ORF and Gag, correspond to products encoded by genes within a transposable element, whereas another two, Calx and MoxGM95, were only identified with one unique peptide. Additionally, Mccc1 had been classified as background in previous biotin pull-down experiments (26Ramirez J. Martinez A. Lectez B. Lee S.Y. Franco M. Barrio R. Dittmar G. Mayor U. Proteomic analysis of the ubiquitin landscape in the Drosophila embryonic nervous system and the adult photoreceptor cells.PLoS One. 2015; 10e0139083Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), as it uses biotin as cofactor. After excluding these proteins, the final list of putative Ari-1 substrates contained 16 proteins (Table 1). Four of these putative Ari-1 substrates are still uncharacterized Drosophila proteins (CG32486, CG32687, CG4629, and CG6424), but the remaining ones are involved in different metabolic processes (CG15117, GstO3, Lsp1β, Oscillin, and PPO1), translation (EIFA), phototransduction (Rh4 and Rh6), ATP-hydrolysis coupled transmembrane transport (Vha 44 and Vha 68-1), and protein degradation (Prosα7). The putative Ari-1 substrate identified with the highest significance (p = 0.0000168) was Comt, a protein known to be involved in neurotransmitter release. The human orthologue of Comt, termed NSF (32Ordway R.W. Pallanck L. Ganetzky B. Neurally expressed Drosophila genes encoding homologs of the NSF and SNAP secretory proteins.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

The complete data set, as well as all GlyGly peptides, is available as Supporting information in Table S1. The proteomics approach we applied does not particularly enrich for ubiquitination sites, nevertheless we did also identify 150 peptides containing the characteristic GlyGly remnant of ubiquitin. That is, the last two Glycines of ubiquitins that are left covalently attached to the substrates after trypsin digestion of the proteins (35Peng J. Schwartz D. Elias J.E. Thoreen C.C. Cheng D.

Of those, 64 GlyGly sites had been previously reported (26Ramirez J. Martinez A. Lectez B. Lee S.Y. Franco M. Barrio R. Dittmar G. Mayor U.

Genet. 2018; 27: 1955-1971Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), but to our knowledge, 86 are novel ubiquitination sites not described until now in Drosophila (Table S1). Among the sites identified, we did also detect GlyGly remnants on the seven internal lysines of ubiquitin, which indicates that all ubiquitin type chains are present in fly neurons. The abundance of all ubiquitin chain types was comparable in control and Ari-1 overexpressing flies (Table S1), suggesting that high levels of Ari-1 do not alter the overall landscape of the ubiquitin linkages in flies, neither directly nor indirectly by affecting other ligases. Having identified Comt as a putative substrate of Ari-1 by mass spectrometry analysis, we decided to validate this result biochemically. To that end, we combined flies that overexpressed a GFP-tagged version of Comt with the control and ari-1OE fly lines previously used for the identification of putative Ari-1 substrates. The first combination gave rise to flies that overexpress the (bioUb)6-BirA construct (Fig. 1B) together with GFP-tagged Comt, termed comt flies (Fig. 4A). The offspring of the second cross (the ari-1OE/comt flies) express the Ari-1 E3 ligase (Fig. 1A), in addition to GFP-tagged Comt and the (bioUb)6-BirA construct (Fig. 4A). We then performed GFP-pull-down assays (30Lee S.Y. Ramirez J. Franco M. Lectez B. Gonzalez M. Barrio R. Mayor U. Ube3a, the E3 ubiquitin ligase causing Angelman syndrome and linked to autism, regulates protein homeostasis through the proteasomal shuttle Rpn10.Cell. Mol.

After pull-downs, which were performed in triplicate, ubiquitinated and nonmodified fractions of Comt were monitored using anti-biotin and anti-GFP antibodies, respectively. We found a reduction of biotin and GFP signal in whole extracts of ari-1OE/comt flies (Fig. S1A, input and Fig. S1B), which led to a reduction in the amount of eluted GFP-Comt protein from Ari-1 overexpressing flies compared with comt flies (Fig. S1A, elution original WB). This can be explained by a Gal4 dose effect, as the same dose of Gal4 protein is driving the expression of two and three UAS constructs in comt and ari-1OE/comt flies, respectively (Fig. 4A). In fact, a reduced expression of the (bioUb)6-BirA construct, measured with anti-BirA antibody, was also observed in ari-1OE/comt flies compared wi"
https://openalex.org/W3128025622,"Background To identify predictors of carotid artery stenosis (CAS) progression in head and neck cancer (HNC) patients after radiation therapy (RT). Methods We included 217 stroke-naïve HNC patients with mild carotid artery stenosis after RT in our hospital. These patients underwent annual carotid duplex ultrasound (CDU) studies to monitor CAS progression. CAS progression was defined as the presence of ≥50% stenosis of the internal/common carotid artery on follow-up CDU. We recorded total plaque score (TPS) and determined the cut-off TPS to predict CAS progression. We categorized patients into high (HP) and low plaque (LP) score groups based on their TPS at enrolment. We analyzed the cumulative events of CAS progression in the two groups. Results The TPS of the CDU study at enrolment was a significant predictor for CAS progression (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 1.69, p = 0.002). The cut-off TPS was 7 (area under the curve: 0.800), and a TPS ≥ 7 strongly predicted upcoming CAS progression (aOR = 41.106, p = 0.002). The HP group had a higher risk of CAS progression during follow-up (adjusted hazard ratio = 6.15; 95% confident interval: 2.29–16.53) in multivariable Cox analysis, and also a higher trend of upcoming ischemic stroke (HP vs. LP: 8.3% vs. 2.2%, p = 0.09). Conclusions HNC patients with a TPS ≥ 7 in any CDU study after RT are susceptible to CAS progression and should receive close monitoring within the following 2 years."
https://openalex.org/W3127651757,"Nomadic movements are often a consequence of unpredictable resource dynamics. However, how nomadic ungulates select dynamic resources is still understudied. Here we examined resource selection of nomadic Mongolian gazelles ( Procapra gutturosa ) in the Eastern Steppe of Mongolia. We used daily GPS locations of 33 gazelles tracked up to 3.5 years. We examined selection for forage during the growing season using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). In winter we examined selection for snow cover which mediates access to forage and drinking water. We studied selection at the population level using resource selection functions (RSFs) as well as on the individual level using step-selection functions (SSFs) at varying spatio-temporal scales from 1 to 10 days. Results from the population and the individual level analyses differed. At the population level we found selection for higher than average NDVI during the growing season. This may indicate selection for areas with more forage cover within the arid steppe landscape. In winter, gazelles selected for intermediate snow cover, which may indicate preference for areas which offer some snow for hydration but not so much as to hinder movement. At the individual level, in both seasons and across scales, we were not able to detect selection in the majority of individuals, but selection was similar to that seen in the RSFs for those individuals showing selection. Difficulty in finding selection with SSFs may indicate that Mongolian gazelles are using a random search strategy to find forage in a landscape with large, homogeneous areas of vegetation. The combination of random searches and landscape characteristics could therefore obscure results at the fine scale of SSFs. The significant results on the broader scale used for the population level RSF highlight that, although individuals show uncoordinated movement trajectories, they ultimately select for similar vegetation and snow cover."
https://openalex.org/W3132959448,"The obesity epidemic has increased type II diabetes mellitus (T2DM) across developed countries. Cardiac T2DM risks include ischemic heart disease, heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, intolerance to ischemia-reperfusion (I-R) injury, and refractoriness to cardioprotection. While opioids are cardioprotective, T2DM causes opioid receptor signaling dysfunction. We tested the hypothesis that sustained opioid receptor stimulus may overcome diabetes mellitus-induced cardiac dysfunction via membrane/mitochondrial-dependent protection. In a murine T2DM model, we investigated effects of morphine on cardiac function, I-R tolerance, ultrastructure, subcellular cholesterol expression, mitochondrial protein abundance, and mitochondrial function. T2DM induced 25% weight gain, hyperglycemia, glucose intolerance, cardiac hypertrophy, moderate cardiac depression, exaggerated postischemic myocardial dysfunction, abnormalities in mitochondrial respiration, ultrastructure and Ca2+-induced swelling, and cell death were all evident. Morphine administration for 5 days: (1) improved glucose homeostasis; (2) reversed cardiac depression; (3) enhanced I-R tolerance; (4) restored mitochondrial ultrastructure; (5) improved mitochondrial function; (6) upregulated Stat3 protein; and (7) preserved membrane cholesterol homeostasis. These data show that morphine treatment restores contractile function, ischemic tolerance, mitochondrial structure and function, and membrane dynamics in type II diabetic hearts. These findings suggest potential translational value for short-term, but high-dose morphine administration in diabetic patients undergoing or recovering from acute ischemic cardiovascular events."

Methods Patients recently licensed for medical cannabis treatment, were recruited just prior to starting medical cannabis consumption (week 0), 1 and 4 weeks later, patients provided 5-minute time saliva samples, which were measured for their volume and pH, and cultured on a special microbial kit, evaluating the growth of Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacillus. Results Out of 16 patients enrolled, 14 were female and had fibromyalgia. The mean age of the patients was 52.8±12.9 years. The mean saliva flow at week 0, week 1 and week 4 were 5.38±3.36 ml/5-minutes, 6 (p = 0.769) and 5.45 (p = 0.391), respectively, and for saliva pH were 6.28, 5.94 (p = 0.51) and 5.5 (p = 0.07) respectively also.

https://openalex.org/W3129203733,"Low back pain (LBP) is a major clinical problem that lacks effective treatments. The sensory innervation in porous vertebral endplates and anxiety contributes to spinal hyperalgesia. We hypothesized that SIRT1 activator resveratrol alleviates LBP and anxiety via promotion of osteogenesis in the porous endplates. The hyperalgesia and anxiety-related behaviors; sensory innervation, inflammation and porosity of endplates; and osteogenic/osteoclastic factors expression were measured following resveratrol treatment after lumbar spine instability (LSI) surgery. To explore whether resveratrol promotes endplates osteogenesis and thus alleviates LBP through activation of SIRT1 in the osteoprogenitor cells of endplates, SIRT1OSX−/− mice were employed. Additionally, the levels of inflammation markers, phosphorylation of cAMP response element-binding protein (pCREB), and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in hippocampus were evaluated. After 4 or 8 weeks LSI surgery, the mice suffered from hyperalgesia and anxiety, which were efficiently attenuated by resveratrol at 8 weeks. Resveratrol treatment-enhanced osteogenesis and decreased endplates porosities accompanied with the reduction of TNFα, IL-1β, and COX2 levels and CGRP+ nerve fibers innervation in porous endplates. Resveratrol-mediated endplates osteogenesis, decreased endplates porosities, and analgesic and antianxiety effects were abrogated in SIRT1OSX−/− mice. Furthermore, resveratrol relieved inflammation and increased pCREB and BDNF expression in the hippocampus after 8 weeks, which alleviate anxiety-related behaviors. This study provides that resveratrol-mediated porous endplates osteogenesis via the activation of SIRT1 markedly blocked sensory innervation and inflammation in endplates, therefore, alleviating LSI surgery-induced LBP and hippocampus-related anxiety."
https://openalex.org/W4214815036,"We have recently reported that a specific pool of ceramide, located in the plasma membrane, mediated the effects of sublethal doses of the chemotherapeutic compound doxorubicin on enhancing cancer cell migration. We identified neutral sphingomyelinase 2 (nSMase2) as the enzyme responsible to generate this bioactive pool of ceramide. In this work, we explored the role of members of the protein phosphatases 1 family (PP1), and we identified protein phosphatase 1 alpha isoform (PP1 alpha) as the specific PP1 isoform to mediate this phenotype. Using a bioinformatics approach, we build a functional interaction network based on phosphoproteomics data on plasma membrane ceramide. This led to the identification of several ceramide-PP1 alpha downstream substrates. Studies on phospho mutants of ezrin (T567) and Scrib (S1378/S1508) demonstrated that their dephosphorylation is sufficient to enhance cell migration. In summary, we identified a mechanism where reduced doses of doxorubicin result in the dysregulation of cytoskeletal proteins and enhanced cell migration. This mechanism could explain the reported effects of doxorubicin worsening cancer metastasis in animal models."

https://openalex.org/W3126311563,"Older adults are at increased risk of pneumococcal disease. This work aims to evaluate whether there is any decrease in serum IgG against variants of the antigens Pneumococcal surface protein A (PspA) and Pneumococcal surface protein C (PspC) in healthy adults with increasing age. Levels of IgG against PspA and PspC variants were determined by ELISA in serum samples comparing volunteers 18–30 years of age with volunteers who were 50–70+ before and after an experimental pneumococcal colonization challenge. The serotype 6B strain used in the challenge belongs to a minor group of pneumococcal isolates expressing two PspC variants. There was a decrease in levels of IgG with increasing age for the most common PspA variants and for all PspC variants analyzed. No correlation was found between basal levels of IgG against these antigens and protection against colonization. There was an increase in levels of IgG against PspA variants that are more cross-reactive with the variant expressed by the challenge strain post challenge in younger individuals who became colonized. Since the challenge strain used in our study expresses two different PspC variants, an increase in serum IgG against all PspC variants tested was observed in younger individuals who became colonized. For some of the antigen variants tested, a decrease in serum IgG was observed in young volunteers who were challenged but did not become colonized. Serum IgG antibodies against PspA and PspC variants thus decrease with age in healthy adults, but there is no correlation between levels of IgG against these antigens and protection against human experimental colonization. Though no correlation between naturally induced serum IgG antibodies against PspA and PspC and protection against colonization was observed, these results do not rule out the protective potential of these antigens as vaccines against pneumococcal infections."
https://openalex.org/W3126758740,"The association between bladder cancer mortality-to-incidence ratios (MIRs) and healthcare disparities has gender differences. However, no evidence supports gender as an issue in the association between changes in the MIR and health expenditures on bladder cancer. Changes in the MIR were defined as the difference in data from the years 2012 and 2018, which was named δMIR. Current health expenditures (CHE) and the human development index (HDI) were obtained from the World Health Organization and the Human Development Report Office. The association between variables was analyzed by Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient. In total, 55 countries were analyzed according to data quality and the exclusion of missing data. Globally, the MIR changed according to the HDI level in both genders. Among the 55 countries studied, a high HDI and CHE were significantly associated with a favorable age-standardized rate-based MIR (ASR-based MIR) in both genders and the subgroups according to gender (for both genders, MIR vs. HDI: ρ = -0.720, p &lt; 0.001; MIR vs. CHE per capita: ρ = -0.760, p &lt; 0.001; MIR vs. CHE as a percentage of gross domestic product (CHE/GDP): ρ = -0.663, p &lt; 0.001). Importantly, in females only, the CHE/GDP but neither the HDI score nor the CHE per capita was significantly associated with a favorable ASR-based δMIR (ASR-based δMIR vs. CHE/GDP: ρ = 0.414, p = 0.002). In the gender subgroups, the association between the HDI and the CHE was statistically significant for females and less significant for males. In conclusion, favorable bladder ASR-based MIRs were associated with a high CHE; however, improvement of the ASR-based δMIR data was more correlated with the CHE in females. Further investigation of the gender differences via a cohort survey with detailed information of clinical-pathological characteristics, treatment strategies, and outcomes might clarify these issues and improve therapeutic and/or screening strategies for bladder cancer."

The objective of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of comorbidities, comedication and drug-drug interactions involving direct-acting antivirals in this population.Comorbidities and comedications were evaluated in a retrospective cohort of hepatitis C patients. Drug-drug interactions were estimated in real life and with simulated data on comedications following drug regimens: telaprevir; elbasvir/grazoprevir, ombitasvir/paritaprevir/r/ritonavir (2D regimen), and sofosbuvir/simeprevir, sofosbuvir/daclatasvir, sofosbuvir/ledipasvir; 2D/dasabuvir (3D regimen); glecaprevir/pibrentasvir and sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir. The interactions were evaluated according to the University of Liverpool database. Statistical analysis was performed by SPSS® 18.0.Data from 1433 patients with hepatitis C were evaluated. The mean patient age was 51.7 years (SD ± 10.7), and 50.6% were female. Direct-acting antivirals were prescribed for 345 (24.1%) patients, and a sustained virological response occurred in 264 (76.5%). The main comorbidities were systemic arterial hypertension [436 (30.4%)], diabetes mellitus [352 (24.6%)] and depression [130 (9.1%)]. The mean number of comorbidities was 1.52 (median [IQR] of 1.00 [1.00-2.00]). The mean number of comedications was 3.16 (median [IQR] of 3.00 [1.00-5.00]). A total of 12916 drug-drug interactions were found, of which 1.859 (14.4%) were high risk, with a mean of 1.29 ± 3.13 per patient. The 3D regimen, as well as glecaprevir/pibrentasvir and sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir, presented the highest drug-drug interaction indexes.Comorbidities and comedications are common in patients with hepatitis C, as are drug-drug interactions. Even when second generation drugs are used, the occurrence of drug-drug interactions still presents a significant risk."
https://openalex.org/W3127395996,"Purpose This study investigated the influence of patient-centeredness on patient safety perception among inpatients, with particular focus on the relationships between subfactors of patient-centeredness and patient safety perception. Methods Data were collected from 122 inpatients in a university hospital from September 24 to October 8, 2019. Patient-centeredness was evaluated using the Patient-Centeredness Assessment Scale; patient safety perception was evaluated using the Korean version of the Patient Safety Perception Scale. Multiple linear regression analysis was conducted using SPSS for Windows 24.0. Results Average patient-centeredness score among inpatients was 77.14 ± 12.64 (range 0–100), and average patient safety perception score was 99.24 ± 15.90 (range 24–120). Patient-centeredness influenced patient safety perception (R 2 = 70%, F = 27.75, p &lt; .001). With respect to subfactors of patient safety perception, the medical team’s activities to ensure safety was affected by the general treatment process and overall evaluation of patient-centeredness (R 2 = 54%, F = 13.14, p &lt; .001); patient safety practice was influenced only by the general treatment process (R 2 = 39%, F = 7.02, p &lt; .001); and trust in the medical system was affected by nurses’ service, the general treatment process, and the hospital environment (R 2 = 44%, F = 8.49, p &lt; .001). Conclusions To enhance patient safety perception, strategies should seek to strengthen patient-centeredness and its related subfactors, particularly the general treatment process, the hospital environment, and nurses’ service."
https://openalex.org/W3128160734,"Extreme weather events and the presence of mega-hydroelectric dams, when combined, present an emerging threat to natural habitats in the Amazon region. To understand the magnitude of these impacts, we used remote sensing data to assess forest loss in areas affected by the extreme 2014 flood in the entire Madeira River basin, the location of two mega-dams. In addition, forest plots (26 ha) were monitored between 2011 and 2015 (14,328 trees) in order to evaluate changes in tree mortality, aboveground biomass (AGB), species composition and community structure around the Jirau reservoir (distance between plots varies from 1 to 80 km). We showed that the mega-dams were the main driver of tree mortality in Madeira basin forests after the 2014 extreme flood. Forest loss in the areas surrounding the reservoirs was 56 km 2 in Santo Antônio, 190 km 2 in Jirau (7.4–9.2% of the forest cover before flooding), and 79.9% above that predicted in environmental impact assessments. We also show that climatic anomalies, albeit with much smaller impact than that created by the mega-dams, resulted in forest loss along different Madeira sub-basins not affected by dams (34–173 km 2 ; 0.5–1.7%). The impact of flooding was greater in várzea and transitional forests, resulting in high rates of tree mortality (88–100%), AGB decrease (89–100%), and reduction of species richness (78–100%). Conversely, campinarana forests were more flood-tolerant with a slight decrease in species richness (6%) and similar AGB after flooding. Taking together satellite and field measurements, we estimate that the 2014 flood event in the Madeira basin resulted in 8.81–12.47 ∙ 10 6 tons of dead biomass. Environmental impact studies required for environmental licensing of mega-dams by governmental agencies should consider the increasing trend of climatic anomalies and the high vulnerability of different habitats to minimize the serious impacts of dams on Amazonian biodiversity and carbon stocks."
https://openalex.org/W3128858540,"Tolerance to the cereal disease Fusarium crown rot (FCR) was investigated in a set of 34 durum wheat genotypes, with Suntop, (bread wheat) and EGA Bellaroi (durum) as tolerant and intolerant controls, in a series of replicated field trials over four years with inoculated (FCR-i) and non-inoculated (FCR-n) plots of the genotypes. The genotypes included conventional durum lines and lines derived from crossing durum with 2–49, a bread wheat genotype with the highest level of partial resistance to FCR. A split plot trial design was chosen to optimize the efficiency for the prediction of FCR tolerance for each genotype. A multi-environment trial (MET) analysis was undertaken which indicated that there was good repeatability of FCR tolerance across years. Based on an FCR tolerance index, Suntop was the most tolerant genotype and EGA Bellaroi was very intolerant, but some durum wheats had FCR tolerance indices which were comparable to Suntop. These included some conventional durum genotypes, V101030, TD1702, V11TD013*3X-63 and DBA Bindaroi, as well as genotypes from crosses with 2–49 (V114916 and V114942). The correlation between FCR tolerance and FCR-n yield predictions was moderately negative indicating it could be somewhat difficult to develop FCR-tolerant genotypes that are high yielding under low disease pressure. However, FCR tolerance showed a positive correlation with FCR-i yield predictions in seasons of high disease expression indicating it could be possible to screen for FCR tolerance using only FCR-i treatments. These results are the first demonstration of genetic diversity in durum germplasm for FCR tolerance and they provide a basis for breeding for this trait."
https://openalex.org/W3126663574,"Background The prevalence of psychological symptoms and the co-occurrence of substance abuse disorders in adult patients with Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) has not been previously explored. We aimed to use validated scales to evaluate depression and anxiety symptoms experienced by adult LCH patients. Methods In this cross-sectional study, all consecutive adult LCH patients seen at our national reference center between January 2012 and January 2013 were asked to complete the following instruments: the Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale (HADS); Barratt Impulsiveness Scale, Version 10 (BIS-10); and Cannabis Use Disorders Identification Test (CUDIT). Self-reported scores on these scales were used to determine the point prevalence of clinically significant psychological symptoms and substance use disorders in LCH patients. Patient profiles in terms of psychological features were assessed by principal component analysis including the HADS and BIS-10 instruments values, followed by hierarchical clustering. Fisher exact tests and Wilcoxon tests were used to examine the associations between disease-related parameters and high levels of anxiety and impulsivity. Results Seventy-one adult LCH patients, mainly with pulmonary LCH (PLCH), completed the evaluations. Clinically significant anxiety and depression symptoms were reported by 22 (31%) and 4 (6%) subjects, respectively. Impulsivity was detected in 14% (10/71) of the patients. Seventeen percent (12/71) of the patients used cannabis on a regular basis, with 50% of these individuals (6/12) exhibiting scores consistent with cannabis use disorder. Three derived clusters of patients were identified in the principal component analysis; these patient clusters differed in successful weaning from tobacco at the time of evaluation (p = 0.03). In univariate analyses, isolated PLCH and the use of psychotropic treatments were statistically associated with clinically significant anxiety symptoms. Conclusions High levels of anxiety and impulsivity are common in adult patients with LCH. The consequences of these symptoms for the management of LCH patients warrant further evaluation."
https://openalex.org/W3127668796,"Differential equations are commonly used to model various types of real life applications. The complexity of these models may often hinder the ability to acquire an analytical solution. To overcome this drawback, numerical methods were introduced to approximate the solutions. Initially when developing a numerical algorithm, researchers focused on the key aspect which is accuracy of the method. As numerical methods becomes more and more robust, accuracy alone is not sufficient hence begins the pursuit of efficiency which warrants the need for reducing computational cost. The current research proposes a numerical algorithm for solving initial value higher order ordinary differential equations (ODEs). The proposed algorithm is derived as a three point block multistep method, developed in an Adams type formulae (3PBCS) and will be used to solve various types of ODEs and systems of ODEs. Type of ODEs that are selected varies from linear to nonlinear, artificial and real life problems. Results will illustrate the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed three point block method. Order, stability and convergence of the method are also presented in the study."
https://openalex.org/W3128262365,"Purpose We developed a compact and lightweight time-resolved mirrorless scintillation detector (TRMLSD) employing image processing techniques and a convolutional neural network (CNN) for high-resolution two-dimensional (2D) dosimetry. Methods The TRMLSD comprises a camera and an inorganic scintillator plate without a mirror. The camera was installed at a certain angle from the horizontal plane to collect scintillation from the scintillator plate. The geometric distortion due to the absence of a mirror and camera lens was corrected using a projective transform. Variations in brightness due to the distance between the image sensor and each point on the scintillator plate and the inhomogeneity of the material constituting the scintillator were corrected using a 20.0 × 20.0 cm 2 radiation field. Hot pixels were removed using a frame-based noise-reduction technique. Finally, a CNN-based 2D dose distribution deconvolution model was applied to compensate for the dose error in the penumbra region and a lack of backscatter. The linearity, reproducibility, dose rate dependency, and dose profile were tested for a 6 MV X-ray beam to verify dosimeter characteristics. Gamma analysis was performed for two simple and 10 clinical intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) plans. Results The dose linearity with brightness ranging from 0.0 cGy to 200.0 cGy was 0.9998 (R-squared value), and the root-mean-square error value was 1.010. For five consecutive measurements, the reproducibility was within 3% error, and the dose rate dependency was within 1%. The depth dose distribution and lateral dose profile coincided with the ionization chamber data with a 1% mean error. In 2D dosimetry for IMRT plans, the mean gamma passing rates with a 3%/3 mm gamma criterion for the two simple and ten clinical IMRT plans were 96.77% and 95.75%, respectively. Conclusion The verified accuracy and time-resolved characteristics of the dosimeter may be useful for the quality assurance of machines and patient-specific quality assurance for clinical step-and-shoot IMRT plans."
https://openalex.org/W3126207489,"Background People with atrial fibrillation (AF) have lower reported quality of life and increased risk of heart attack, death, and stroke. Lifestyle modifications can improve arrhythmia-free survival/symptom severity. Shared medical appointments (SMAs) have been effective at targeting lifestyle change in other chronic diseases and may be beneficial for patients with AF. Objective To determine if perceived self-management and satisfaction with provider communication differed between patients who participated in SMAs compared to patients in standard care. Secondary objectives were to examine differences between groups for knowledge about AF, symptom severity, and healthcare utilization. Methods We conducted a retrospective analysis of data collected where patients were assigned to either standard care (n = 62) or a SMA (n = 59). Surveys were administered at pre-procedure, 3, and 6 months. Results Perceived self-management was not significantly different at baseline (p = 0.95) or 6 months (p = 0.21). Patients in SMAs reported more knowledge gain at baseline (p = 0.01), and higher goal setting at 6 months (p = 0.0045). Symptom severity for both groups followed similar trends. Conclusion Patients with AF who participated in SMAs had similar perceived self-management, patient satisfaction with provider communication, symptom severity, and healthcare utilization with their counterparts, but had a statistically significant improvement in knowledge about their disease."
