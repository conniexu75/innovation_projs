To test this hypothesis and investigate the possible involvement of Ca2+ signaling disruptions in amyloid-induced cytotoxicity, we made homogeneous preparations of disease-related amyloids (Aβ, prion, islet amyloid polypeptide, polyglutamine, and lysozyme) in various aggregation states and tested their actions on fluo-3-loaded SH-SY5Y cells. Application of oligomeric forms of all amyloids tested (0.6–6 μgml–1) rapidly (∼5 s) elevated intracellular Ca2+, whereas equivalent amounts of monomers and fibrils did not. Ca2+ signals evoked by Aβ42 oligomers persisted after depletion of intracellular Ca2+ stores, and small signals remained in Ca2+-free medium, indicating contributions from both extracellular and intracellular Ca2+ sources. The increased membrane permeability to Ca2+ cannot be attributed to activation of endogenous Ca2+ channels, because responses were unaffected by the potent Ca2+-channel blocker cobalt (20 μm). Instead, observations that Aβ42 and other oligomers caused rapid cellular leakage of anionic fluorescent dyes point to a generalized increase in membrane permeability. The resulting unregulated flux of ions and molecules may provide a common mechanism for oligomer-mediated toxicity in many amyloidogenic diseases, with dysregulation of Ca2+ ions playing a crucial role because of their strong trans-membrane concentration gradient and involvement in cell dysfunction and death.

Alzheimer disease (AD) 1The abbreviations used are: AD, Alzheimer disease; IAPP, islet amyloid polypeptide. 1The abbreviations used are: AD, Alzheimer disease; IAPP, islet amyloid polypeptide. is characterized by the appearance in the brain of plaques, containing extracellular deposits of amyloid β-peptide (Aβ) that result from altered proteolytic processing of amyloid precursor protein, together with intracellular neurofibrillary tangles containing misfolded tau (1Mattson M.P. Nature. 2004; 430: 631-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (2429) Google Scholar). Brain regions with plaques and tangles exhibit reduced numbers of synapses, and neurites associated with plaques and tangles are often damaged, suggesting a pivotal role for Aβ in the neuropathology of AD (2Kosik K.S.

Moreover, numerous other neurodegenerative disorders (including Huntington, Parkinson, and prion diseases) are also associated with the formation and accumulation of amyloid fibrils in specific brain areas (6Lashuel H.A.

Mol. Med. 2003; 81: 678-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (1321) Google Scholar). These commonalities suggest a general mechanism of action for the more than 100 human amyloid-related diseases, whereby normally soluble peptides and proteins undergo aberrant folding (8Dobson C.M. Science. 2004; 304: 1259-1262Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar).Aggregation of Aβ proceeds through several conformational states, including dimers, spherical oligomers composed of 10–24 monomers, and strings of oligomers (protofibrils), before finally assuming an insoluble fibrillar conformation (9Glabe C.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; 29: 542-547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The initial formulation of the “amyloid hypothesis” of AD specifically implicated fibrillar amyloid deposits (10Hardy J.A. Higgins G.A. Science. 1992; 256: 184-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (4911) Google Scholar). However, more recent evidence suggests that soluble oligomers may be the principal neurotoxic agent (11Lambert M.P.

Moreover, soluble oligomeric forms of several amyloids (including islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP), α-synuclein, prion, and polyglutamine) are, respectively, implicated as the primary toxic species in type 2 diabetes mellitus, Parkinson disease, spongiform encephalopathies, and Huntington disease (6Lashuel H.A.

Neurosci. 2003; 26: 267-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (1433) Google Scholar). This toxicity of amyloid oligomers appears to be intrinsically related to their aggregation state, because oligomeric forms of proteins and peptides that are not disease-related are equally toxic (14Bucciantini M. Giannoni E. Chiti F. Baroni F. Formigli L. Zurdo J. Taddei N. Ramponi G. Dobson C.M. Stefani M. Nature. 2002; 416: 507-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (2132) Google Scholar, 19Bucciantini M. Calloni G.

Taken together, these findings support the notion of “conformational disease” (20Carrell R.W. Lomas D.A. Lancet. 1997; 350: 134-138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar), whereby a common structural motif formed by otherwise unrelated amyloid oligomers leads to a common mechanism of pathogenesis (14Bucciantini M. Giannoni E. Chiti F. Baroni F. Formigli L. Zurdo J. Taddei N. Ramponi G. Dobson C.M. Stefani M. Nature. 2002; 416: 507-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (2132) Google Scholar, 15Kayed R. Head E. Thompson J.L. McIntire T.M. Milton S.C. Cotman C.W. Glabe C.G. Science. 2003; 300: 486-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (3405) Google Scholar). However, it remains to be established precisely which aggregation state is primarily responsible for the neurotoxicity, and difficulties in preparing highly homogeneous and stable populations of monomers, oligomeric intermediates, and fibrils may account for observations of highly variable actions among different cells (21Kawahara M. Kuroda Y. Arispe N. Rojas E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14077-14083Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar).Questions also remain regarding the mechanism of amyloid toxicity. Growing evidence points to a disruption of intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis in AD and other amyloidogenic diseases (1Mattson M.P. Nature. 2004; 430: 631-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (2429) Google Scholar, 21Kawahara M. Kuroda Y. Arispe N. Rojas E. J. Biol.

S. A. 2004; 101: 14326-14332Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), and elevated intracellular Ca2+ levels are known to trigger apoptosis and/or excessive phosphorylation of key proteins that ultimately lead to cell death (23Berridge M.J. Bootman M.D. Lipp P. Nature. 1998; 395: 645-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (1756) Google Scholar, 24Pierrot N. Ghisdal P. Caumont A.S. Octave J.N. J.

Neurosci. 2002; 3: 862-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar). Prefibrillar amyloid aggregates have been shown to elevate cytosolic Ca2+ in neurons (19Bucciantini M. Calloni G. Chiti F.

Peptides. 2002; 23: 1311-1315Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) or through a general disruption of lipid integrity (34Kayed R. Sokolov Y. Edmonds B. MacIntire T.M. Milton S.C. Hall J.E. Glabe C.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 46363-46366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (761) Google Scholar).To address these issues we prepared pure samples of monomeric, oligomeric, and fibrillar forms of several disease-related amyloids and examined their respective actions on cytosolic Ca2+ levels in SH-SY5Y cells. We show that amyloid oligomers consistently produce rapid and dramatic elevations in [Ca2+], whereas equivalent concentrations of monomers or fibrils do not. The action of amyloid oligomers appears to involve a channel-independent disruption of the integrity of both plasma and intracellular membranes, and we propose that this may be a neurotoxic mechanism common to many amyloidogenic diseases.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Fluorescent dyes (fluo-3AM, calcein) and thapsigargin were from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Ionomycin, cell culture media, and other reagents were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Peptides were synthesized as described previously (35Burdick D. Soreghan B. Kwon M. Kosmoski J. Knauer M. Henschen A. Yates J. Cotman C. Glabe C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 546-554Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Lyophilized peptides and proteins were resuspended in 50% acetonitrile in water and re-lyophilized.Preparation of Homogeneous Populations of Amyloid Peptide Monomers, Oligomers, and Fibrils—Soluble monomer and oligomers were prepared by dissolving 1.0 mg of peptide in 400 μl of hexafluoroisopropanol for 10–20 min at room temperature. 100 μl of the resulting seedless solution was added to 900 μl double-distilled water in a siliconized Eppendorf tube. After 10–20-min incubation at room temperature, the samples were centrifuged for 15 min at 14,000 × g, and the supernatant fraction (pH 2.8–3.5) was transferred to a new siliconized tube and subjected to a gentle stream of N2 for 5–10 min to evaporate the hexafluoroisopropanol. The monomer solutions were used immediately after evaporation of hexafluoroisopropanol. For soluble oligomers, the samples were then stirred at 500 rpm using a Teflon-coated microstir bar for 24–48 h at 22 °C. Aliquots (10 μl) were taken at 6–12-h intervals for observation by electron microscopy and size exclusion chromatography. For prion 106–126, the samples were heated at 65 °C for 30 min before stirring. Poly(Q) was heated for 2 h at 37 °C.Fibrils were prepared as described above for oligomers, except they were stirred at room temperature for 6–9 days and sodium azide was added (0.02%). The final peptide concentration was 0.3 mg/ml. Fibril formation was monitored by thioflavin T fluorescence and UV light scattering. Once fibril formation was complete, the solutions were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 20 min, the fibril pellet was washed three times with double-distilled water and then resuspended in the desired buffer. The morphology was verified by negative stain electron microscopy as reported previously (34Kayed R. Sokolov Y. Edmonds B. MacIntire T.M. Milton S.C. Hall J.E. Glabe C.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 46363-46366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (761) Google Scholar).Cell Culture and Dye Loading—SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, glutamine (4 mm), penicillin (200 units/ml), streptomycin (200 μg/ml), and sodium pyruvate (1 μm). Cells were maintained at 37 °C in 5% CO2, and the medium was replaced every 2 days. Cells (∼10,000) were plated in 35-mm glass-bottom culture dishes (MatTek Corp.) and grown overnight. Loading with the Ca2+ indicator fluo-3 was accomplished by incubating with fluo-3-AM (7 μm in Hanks' balanced salt solution) for 30 min at room temperature, washing 3 times with Hanks' balanced salt solution and maintaining at 37 °C for 20 min to ensure complete hydrolysis. A similar loading protocol was utilized to load cells with calcein by incubating with 7 μm calcein-AM.Fluorescence Imaging—The imaging system consisted of an inverted microscope (Olympus IX 71) equipped with a Leitz 16X objective. Fluorescence excitation was by a 488 nm argon ion laser, and emitted fluorescence (λ > 510 nm) was imaged by a cooled CCD camera (Cascade 650, Roper Scientific). Time-lapse images (1 frame s–1) were captured using the MetaMorph software package (Universal Imaging, Westchester, PA), and fluorescence intensities were measured from regions of interest centered on individual cells. Signals are expressed as a pseudo ratio (ΔF/F) of the change in fluorescence (ΔF) divided by the resting fluorescence before treatment (F). A small proportion (9%) of cells failed to load with fluo-3, having low initial fluorescence and failing to respond to ionomycin. These were excluded from analysis.Amyloids were applied by pipetting a fixed aliquot (70 μl) of a diluted stock solution into the recording chamber (1-ml volume) directly above the microscope objective. To estimate the resulting concentration experienced by the cells under observation we pipetted the same volume of a fluorescent dye (calcein) into the chamber and measured the resulting fluorescence in the vicinity of the cells relative to that of the initial, undiluted solution of dye. This calibration yielded a dilution factor of about 5, which was assumed in calculating the effective concentrations of amyloids.To avoid complications from differences in molecular weights between monomers, oligomers and fibrils, we express these concentrations in units of μgml–1. As a rough guide, a concentration of 0.6 μg/ml Aβ42 corresponds to 200 nm monomer and ∼7 nm oligomer and 70 pm fibrils.RESULTSAβ42 Oligomers, but Not Monomers or Fibrils, Increase Intracellular Free Ca2+—Homogeneous populations of monomeric, oligomeric, and fibrillar Aβ were prepared as described above and characterized by size exclusion chromatography and electron microscopy. The oligomeric preparation had an approximate molecular mass of 90 kDa, contained very little material of lower molecular mass, and was comprised of spherical vesicles with diameters of 2–5 nm (Fig. 1). The monomeric preparation contained no detectable oligomeric aggregates as analyzed by size exclusion chromatography (Fig. 1). The morphology of the fibrillar preparations was as published previously (34Kayed R. Sokolov Y. Edmonds B. MacIntire T.M. Milton S.C. Hall J.E. Glabe C.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 46363-46366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (761) Google Scholar).The actions of homogeneous monomeric, oligomeric, and fibrillar preparations of soluble Aβ42 amyloid were examined by adding aliquots of the samples to fluo-3-loaded SH-SY5Y cells (Fig. 2). Fig. 2A illustrates images and corresponding Ca2+-dependent fluorescence measurements in a representative cell. Applications of monomers or fibrils at final concentrations of 6 μg/ml evoked no detectable change in fluorescence, whereas subsequent application of the same amount of oligomer evoked large and rapid (∼5 s) increases in Ca2+-dependent fluorescence. Similar results were obtained in >200 cells examined. For example, Fig. 2B shows mean fluorescence signals from 22 cells, where Aβ42 oligomers evoked a fluo-3 signal with a peak increase of ΔF/F = 3.3 ± 0.5 (S.E.).Fig. 2Aβ42 oligomers, but not monomers or fibrils, elevate intracellular free [Ca2+].A, time course of Ca2+-dependent fluorescence recorded from a single fluo-3-loaded SH-SY5Y cell in response to sequential application of monomers, fibrils, and oligomers of Aβ42 (each at a final concentration of 6 μg/ml). The inset images of the cell were captured at the times indicated during the trace and are depicted on a pseudo color scale with “warmer” colors on a rainbow scale corresponding to higher fluorescence. B, trace shows the average responses from 22 cells, evoked using the same protocol. Error bars indicate ± 1 S.E.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The fact that monomeric and fibrillar samples were inactive rules out the possibility that the increase in Ca2+ was due to trace contaminants in the solvent, because the solvent remained the same over the time of incubation for the conversion of monomer to oligomer and then ultimately to fibrils. Solvent controls in the absence of peptide had no effect on Ca2+ levels (data not shown).Actions of Other Disease-related Amyloids—To explore the possibility of a common neurotoxic mechanism among amyloidogenic diseases, we selected five disease-related amyloid peptides (Aβ42, prion, IAPP, polyglutamine, and lysozyme) and tested the effects of purified monomers, oligomers and fibrils of each of these amyloids on cytosolic Ca2+. Fig. 3A illustrates representative fluorescence records obtained with IAPP at a concentration of 6 μg/ml. Applications of IAPP monomers and fibrils evoked no detectable Ca2+ signals, even though the same cells showed large increases in fluorescence when subsequently challenged with the Ca2+ ionophore ionomycin (Fig. 3A, traces a and b). In marked contrast, equivalent amounts of purified IAPP oligomers produced a large fluorescence signal (Fig. 3A, trace c), closely resembling the response evoked by Aβ42 oligomers.Fig. 3Ca2+ elevations induced by other amyloids depend upon their aggregation state.A, fluorescence records illustrating typical responses to applications of 6 μg/ml of Aβ42 monomer (trace a), fibrils (trace b), and oligomers (trace c). Each trace was obtained from a different cell. No responses were observed to monomers or fibrils, even though the same cells gave large signals when subsequently challenged with ionomycin (6 μm). B, pooled data showing mean fluorescence signals (+S.E.) from 40 to 200 cells evoked by Aβ42, prion, IAPP, poly(Q), and lysozyme, each at a final concentration of 6 μg/ml. Measurements were obtained from records like those in A. For each amyloid, the histogram bars show responses evoked by monomers, fibrils, and oligomers.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Mean results obtained with all five amyloids are summarized in Fig. 3B. In each case the oligomeric forms evoked large increases in intracellular [Ca2+] (respective peak ΔF/F values Aβ42 = 3.3 ± 0.08; prion = 2.18 ± 0.1; IAPP = 2.45 ± 0.19; polyglutamine = 3.58 ± 0.07; lysozyme = 2.77 ± 0.1), whereas monomers and fibrils failed to produce any appreciable signal. Among a total of 1320 cells analyzed, 1280 showed Ca2+ responses to oligomers, whereas we never observed appreciable (ΔF/F > 0.4) fluorescence increases with monomers or fibrils.Concentration Dependence of Oligomer Action—We next examined the concentration dependence of the Ca2+ signals on oligomer concentration, using IAPP and Aβ42 as representative amyloids. The protocol is illustrated in Fig. 4A, and involved sequential additions of oligomer to the imaging chamber, resulting in stepwise increases in concentration. Concentrations of IAPP oligomer as low as 0.6 μg/ml (corresponding to 7.5 nm assuming a molecular mass of 80 kDa) already evoked a detectable fluorescence increase, and 12 μg/ml (about 150 nm) produced a maximal response, as assessed by the failure of ionomycin to cause any further increase in fluorescence (data not shown). Fig. 4B shows mean measurements of relative fluorescence signals evoked by increasing concentrations of Aβ42 and IAPP oligomers. Both amyloids showed similar concentration-response relationships, with half-maximal responses at respective concentrations of 2.7 and 3.5 μg/ml. These values may, however, underestimate the true EC50 of the oligomers if the indicator dye were saturated at higher concentrations.Fig. 4Dose dependence of Aβ42 and IAPP oligomers.A, trace shows Ca2+-dependent fluorescence signals averaged from 26 cells in response to successive additions of IAPP oligomers, resulting in stepwise concentration increases to final levels of 0.6, 2.4, 6, and 12 μg/ml. The inset images show pseudo color representations of a single cell, captured at the times indicated by the trace. B, mean peak fluorescence signals evoked by different concentrations of Aβ (red bars) and IAPP (blue bars) oligomers. Data are from 78 cells for IAPP and 85 for Aβ42 and are expressed as a percentage of the maximal response evoked by 12 μg/ml oligomer.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Elevation of Cytosolic Free Ca2+from Aβ42 Oligomers Involves Both Intra- and Extracellular Sources—To discriminate whether the increase in cytosolic Ca2+ concentration evoked by amyloid oligomers arises from influx of extracellular Ca2+ across the plasma membrane or from Ca2+ liberated from intracellular stores, we reduced the free extracellular Ca2+ concentration to very low levels by bathing cells for 20 min in a Ca2+-free medium that included 5 mm Mg2+ and 10 mm EGTA. Application of Aβ42 oligomers (6 μg/ml) then evoked only a small, slowly rising fluorescence signal, which reached a peak amplitude of about 30% of that in Ca2+-containing medium (Fig. 5A). Thus, the large, immediate Ca2+ increase induced by oligomers appears to result from influx of extracellular Ca2+, whereas the remaining small, slow component may arise from intracellular Ca2+ liberation.Fig. 5Aβ42 oligomer-induced rise in cytosolic [Ca2+] involves Ca2+ ions from both extracellular and intracellular sources.A,Ca2+ signals were reduced, but not abolished, when Aβ42 oligomers (6 μg/ml) were applied to cells bathed in Ca2+-free medium. The trace shows the mean fluorescence (±1 S.E.) from 31 cells. B, depletion of endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ stores does not abolish oligomer-induced Ca2+ signals in cells bathed in normal (1.8 mm Ca2+) medium. Following pretreatment with 5 μm thapsigargin, a specific blocker of sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase Ca2+ pumps, applications of 6 μg/ml Aβ42 oligomers induced a large, rapid rise in fluorescence with an amplitude (ΔF/F = 0.7) similar to that obtained in the absence of thapsigargin (ΔF/F = 0.5). Trace shows mean ± 1 S.E. of results in 38 cells. C, Ca2+ signals evoked by Aβ42 oligomers are not reduced by cobalt, a nonspecific Ca2+ channel blocker. Cells were pretreated with 20 μm cobalt for 10 min. Subsequent application of 6 μg/ml of Aβ42 oligomers evoked a mean Ca2+-dependent fluorescence signal (black trace) of similar amplitude and kinetics to that in the absence of cobalt (gray trace). Data with cobalt were obtained from 27 cells. Control data (gray trace) are reproduced from Fig. 3A, trace c.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To confirm the latter interpretation we then depleted the endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ stores of cells bathed in normal [Ca2+] medium by applying thapsigargin, a specific sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase pump inhibitor. Thapsigargin evoked a small rise in the Ca2+ signal, consistent with leakage of Ca2+ from intracellular stores into the cytosol, but subsequent application of Aβ42 oligomers produced a large, rapid increase, similar to that observed in control cells without thapsigargin treatment (Fig. 5B).We examined the possibility that amyloidogenic peptides may induce Ca2+ influx via endogenous Ca2+-permeable plasma membrane ion channels (30Guo Q.

https://openalex.org/W1998763810,"The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and Akt proteins regulate various steps of muscle development and growth, but the physiological relevance and the downstream effectors are under investigation. Here we show that S6 kinase 1 (S6K1), a protein kinase activated by nutrients and insulin-like growth factors (IGFs), is essential for the control of muscle cytoplasmic volume by Akt and mTOR. Deletion of S6K1 does not affect myoblast cell proliferation but reduces myoblast size to the same extent as that observed with mTOR inhibition by rapamycin. In the differentiated state, S6K1(-/-) myotubes have a normal number of nuclei but are smaller, and their hypertrophic response to IGF1, nutrients and membrane-targeted Akt is blunted. These growth defects reveal that mTOR requires distinct effectors for the control of muscle cell cycle and size, potentially opening new avenues of therapeutic intervention against neoplasia or muscle atrophy."

Current knowledge of miRNA function is mainly based on the result from the founding members of miRNA, lin-4 (2Lee R.C. Feinbaum R.L. Ambros V. Cell. 1993; 75: 843-854Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9297) Google Scholar) and let-7 (17Reinhart B.J. Slack F.J. Basson M. Pasquinelli A.E. Bettinger J.C. Rougvie A.E. Horvitz H.R. Ruvkun G. Nature. 2000; 403: 901-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (3654) Google Scholar) in Caenorhabditis elegans. Both are heterochronic genes whose mutations result in developmental defects (for review see Ref. 18Pasquinelli A.E. Ruvkun G. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2002; 18: 495-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Up-regulation of lin-4 during the first larval stage (L1) triggers the subsequent developmental stages by translational repression of lin-14 and lin-28, both of which contain sites of partial complementarity to lin-4 in the 3′-untranslated region (19Feinbaum R. Ambros V. Dev. Biol. 1999; 210: 87-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 20Moss E.G. Lee R.C. Ambros V.

Likewise, let-7 is induced during development and translationally repress lin-41 through partially complementary base-pairing between let-7 and target sequences in the 3′-untranslated region of lin-41 (17Reinhart B.J.

Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 132-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). The study of a miRNA function has been hampered by the lack of an efficient method to deplete a miRNA, especially in mammals where genetic experiments are hard to perform. Kawasaki and Taira (24Kawasaki H. Taira K. Nature. 2003; 423: 838-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) reported a knock-down of a miRNA by a siRNA against the loop region of the miRNA precursor, but the paper was retracted (25Kawasaki H. Taira K. Nature. 2003; 426: 100Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Recently, 2′-O-methyl antisense oligonucleotide against a miRNA was reported to specifically knock-down the miRNA (26Meister G. Landthaler M. Dorsett Y. Tuschl T. RNA. 2004; 10: 544-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar, 27Hutvagner G. Simard M.J. Mello C.C. Zamore P.D. PLoS Biol. 2004; 2: e98Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). Despite the successful knock-down of a miRNA in vitro and in vivo, this method has several limitations. First, a direct measurement of the depletion of a miRNA is difficult, because 2′-O-methyl antisense oligonucleotide binds to the miRNA and sequesters it from its target rather than induces its degradation. In addition, even a slight contamination of 2′-O-methyl antisense oligonucleotide in an RNA preparation interferes with assays to measure the miRNA level, such as Northern blot, primer extension assay, or RNase protection assay. 2Y. S. Lee and A. Dutta, unpublished data. 2Y. S. Lee and A. Dutta, unpublished data. Therefore, the only possible way to confirm the decrease of a miRNA is to employ a very indirect and cumbersome assay, measuring the level of expression of a reporter gene containing the target sequence of the miRNA. In addition, although rescuing the depletion effect by adding back miRNA is the most stringent control against the nonspecific effects of miRNA depletion, the knock-down phenotype cannot be rescued in the presence of the 2′-O-methyl antisense oligonucleotide. In addition to 2′-O-methyl antisense oligonucleotides to miRNAs, we now show that siRNA against the loop region of a pre-miRNA can be used to specifically down-regulate miRNAs. The unique advantages of this method over 2′-O-methyl antisense oligonucleotide will be discussed. Using both these methods, we show that miR-125b, putative homolog of lin-4 in C. elegans (9Lagos-Quintana M. Rauhut R. Yalcin A. Meyer J. Lendeckel W. Tuschl T. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 735-739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2694) Google Scholar), is critical for the proliferation of differentiated human cell lines, providing a new example of the biological role of a mammalian miRNA. In addition, we could restore miRNA function in the miRNA-depleted cells by the introduction of single-stranded RNA representing the miRNA sequence. Although the exact regulatory mechanism of mammalian lin-28 and lin-41 in in vitro differentiation systems or the role of the miRNAs in this regulation has not yet been described, a translational control of mammalian Lin-28 has been hypothesized similar to that seen in C. elegans (28Moss E.G. Tang L. Dev. Biol. 2003; 258: 432-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 29Sempere L.F. Freemantle S. Pitha-Rowe I. Moss E. Dmitrovsky E. Ambros V. Genome Biology. 2004; (http://genomebiology.com/2004/5/1/reviews/R13)PubMed Google Scholar, 30Nelson P.T. Hatzigeorgiou A.G. Mourelatos Z. RNA. 2004; 10: 387-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). The hypothesis is based on the following observations; 1) the evolutionary conservation of lin-4 and let-7 miRNAs and their targets lin-28 and lin-41, 2) the presence of putative target sequences with imperfect complementarity to miR-125b and let-7 within the 3′-untranslated region of lin-28 and lin-41, and 3) induction of miR-125b and let-7 and the attendant decrease of Lin-28 protein during differentiation. This assumption was supported by an experiment with artificial luciferase construct fused to the let-7 target sequence that is naturally found in the 3′-untranslated region of mammalian lin-28 mRNAs (30Nelson P.T. Hatzigeorgiou A.G. Mourelatos Z. RNA. 2004; 10: 387-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Using the methods developed above to decrease or increase miR-125b or let-7, we, however, find that the decrease of lin-28 and lin-41 during differentiation appears independent of the levels of these miRNAs, demonstrating the importance of miRNA depletion strategies to identify real targets of miRNAs in vivo. The negative result is probably explained by the fact that the decrease of lin-28 and lin-41 is mainly at the transcriptional stage, suggesting a variation in the paradigm of lin-28 and lin-41 regulation during differentiation of mammalian cells in vitro. RNA Isolation, Northern Blotting, and Primer Extension Assay— Total RNAs from various cell lines were isolated with Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Total RNAs from human cervix, prostate, and brain were purchased from Ambion. Multiple tissue Northern blot (human MTN blot II) was purchased from Clontech. Primer extension assay (31Hutvagner G. McLachlan J. Pasquinelli A.E. Balint E. Tuschl T. Zamore P.D. Science. 2001; 293: 834-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (2130) Google Scholar) was performed with Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) as per the manufacturer's instructions, with minor modifications. 20 μl of extension reaction contained 0.1 pmol of the γ-32P-labeled primer and 10 μg of total RNA. In the case of the 5 S rRNA extension reaction, 1 μg of total RNA was used. Extension reaction at 50 °C for 50 min was quenched by the addition of 20 μl of sequencing gel loading buffer (32Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Extension products were resolved from the primer by electrophoresis in an 18% polyacrylamide gel with 7 m urea. The sequences of the primers are as follows: let-7a-3-ext, 5′-GCCCCAAACTATACAACCTACTAC-3′; miR-125a-ext, 5′-TCACAGGTTAAAGGGTCTCA-3′; miR-125b-ext, 5′-CATCACAAGTTAGGGTCTCA-3′; 5 S rRNA-ext, 5′-GATCGGGCGCGTTCAGGGTGGTAT-3′; miR-16-ext, 5′-ACTACGCCAATATTTACGTGCT-3′; miR-15a-ext, 5′-AATCCACAAACCATTATGTGCT-3′. siRNAs, 2′-O-Methyl Oligonucleotides, miRNA, and Transfections— siRNA duplexes and 2′-O-methyl oligonucleotides were synthesized by Dharmacon. Transfection was performed with Oligofectamine reagent (Invitrogen) as per the manufacturer's instructions. Unless indicated, 960 nm of siRNA duplexes designed against the loop regions of miRNAs was used for the transfection into Tera-2 or PC-3 cell lines (ATCC number CRL-1435). In the case of 2′-O-methyl antisense oligonucleotides against miR-125b or GL2, 160 nm oligonucleotides were transfected into PC3 or HeLa cells. The target sequences for siRNA duplexes are as follows: siRNA against miR-125b-1 (si125b-1), 5′-AACCGUUUAAAUCCACGGGUU-3′; siRNA against miR-125b-2 (si125b-2), 5′-AAGGUAUUUUAGUAACAUCAC-3′; siRNA against miR-16–1 (si16–1), 5′-AAGAUUCUAAAAUUAUCUCCA-3′; siRNA against miR-16–2 (si16–2), 5′-GGCGUAGUGAAAUAUAUAU-3′; siRNA against miR-15a (si15a), 5′GUGGAUUUUGAAAAGGUGC3′. RNA oligonucleotides of mature let-7a-3 and miR-125b sequences were synthesized by Dharmacon. Transfection was performed as described above but at the final concentration of 2 μm. During long-term experiment with multiple transfections, we performed the first three transfections every day and the transfections from the fourth and later every other day. Cell Proliferation Assay—Cell growth was measured with CellTiter 96 non-radioactive cell proliferation assay kit (Promega). Cell Culture, Retinoic Acid Treatment, and Stem Cell Differentiation—Tera-2 cells (ATCC number HTB-106) were treated with 5 μm all-trans-retinoic acid (Sigma) on a gelatin-coated tissue culture dish (33Pertovaara L. Tienari J. Vainikka S. Partanen J. Saksela O. Lehtonen E. Alitalo K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 191: 149-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Culture medium with retinoic acid was refreshed every other day. The cells were cultured in the presence of retinoic acid for 20 days, with subsequent cultivation for an additional 40 days without retinoic acid. Neural induction from mouse embryonic stem (ES) cell line D3 (ATCC number CRL-11632) was maintained and differentiated using the five-stage procedure as described (34Lee S.H. Lumelsky N. Studer L. Auerbach J.M. McKay R.D. Nat. Biotechnol. 2000; 18: 675-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (1115) Google Scholar). Briefly, undifferentiated ES cells were cultured on gelatin-coated dishes in supplemented Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) and differentiated into embryoid bodies (EBs) on nonadherent bacterial dishes. The EBs were then plated onto an adhesive tissue culture surface, and neuronal precursor (NP) cells were selected in serum-free medium. After 6–10 days of selection, cells were trypsinized, and nestin+ NP cells were expanded in N2 medium supplemented with 1 μg/ml laminin (Sigma) and 10 ng/ml bovine fibroblast growth factor (R & D Systems). After expansion for 4 days, bovine fibroblast growth factor was removed to induce differentiation to neuronal phenotypes. Nuclear Run-on Assay—ORFs of lin-28 and lin-41 were PCR-amplified from Tera-2 cDNA. 0.5 μg of each fragment was slot-blotted onto a positively charged Nylon membrane (Nytran from Schleicher & Schuell). Nucleus isolation and run-on transcription reaction were performed as described (35Greenberg M.E. Bender T.P. Struhl K. Short Protocols in Molecular Biology. 1. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York2002: 4-29Google Scholar) with modifications. After the transcription reaction, Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) was added, and an RNA probe was prepared according to the manufacturer's instructions for Trizol reagent. Membranes were probed with 32P-labeled run-on RNA for 16 h at 68 °C in hybridization buffer containing 0.25 m Na2HPO4 (pH 7.2), 1 mm EDTA, and 7% (w/v) SDS. Membranes were washed twice in 2× SSC (1× SSC = 0.15 m NaCl and 0.015 m sodium citrate) at room temperature for 15 min each followed by a wash in 0.2× SSC and 1% (w/v) SDS at 65 °C for 20 min. The blot was exposed to a PhosphorImager Storm 860 (Amersham Biosciences) and quantitated. Recombinant Lin-28 and Antiserum—cDNA containing full-length human Lin-28 protein (209 amino acids) was cloned into pET-23a(+) (Novagen). Recombinant Lin-28 with hexahistidine tag was expressed in BL21(DE3), purified through nickel-charged chelating Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences), and used for raising antiserum in rabbit. Antibody was proven specific by the following criteria. It recognized the recombinant Lin-28 and a single protein band of expected size of Lin-28 in Tera-2 cell extract, whereas preimmune serum did not detect a protein of appropriate size (data not shown). In addition, it failed to detect protein in the extract of PC-3 cells where lin-28 mRNA was not detectable. Expression of let-7 and miR-125b in Differentiated Cells— Primer extension assays were employed to quantitate miR-125a and miR-125b, miRNAs that are the putative lin-4 homologs in mouse and human (9Lagos-Quintana M. Rauhut R. Yalcin A. Meyer J. Lendeckel W. Tuschl T. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 735-739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2694) Google Scholar). miR-125a is detectable in PC-3, HeLa, Tera-2 (Fig. 1), and other cell lines (data not shown). Two other miRNAs, miR-15 and miR-30, are present in a constant amount in these three cell lines (data not shown). In contrast, miR-125b level is highest in PC-3, moderate in HeLa and other cell lines, and undetectable in Tera-2 (Fig. 1; data not shown). Tera-2 is an embryonic carcinoma (EC) cell line representing undifferentiated cells. The higher expression of miR-125b in differentiated cells compared with undifferentiated cells is also seen with let-7 (9Lagos-Quintana M. Rauhut R. Yalcin A. Meyer J. Lendeckel W. Tuschl T. Curr.

Tissues from prostate, cervix, and brain have higher levels of these miRNAs than the corresponding cell lines (Fig. 1). Thus, in all cell lines and tissues examined, human let-7 and miR-125b are expressed specifically in differentiated cells or tissues, reminiscent of the higher expression seen later in development in flies and worms. The Depletion of miR-125b-2 in Differentiated Cancer Cells Inhibits Cell Proliferation—We first attempted to decrease miR-125b by siRNAs against the precursor of the mature miRNA.

The pre-miRNA is, therefore, expected to be susceptible to siRNAs against the loop of the hairpin. There are two predicted precursors of miR-125b in humans, miR-125b-1 and -2. Both precursors share identical mature miRNA sequence, but the sequences flanking the mature miRNA are different (Fig. 2A, left panel). Two synthetic siRNAs were designed against the loop regions of miR-125b-1 and -2 (si125b-1 and si125b-2; Fig. 2A, left panel). After transfection of these siRNAs into PC-3 cells, the miR-125b level was measured by a primer extension assay. miR-125b was greatly reduced by the si125b-2 but not si125b-1 (Fig. 2A, right panel). This observation suggests that most of the mature miR-125b is derived from the precursor miR-125b-2 in PC-3 cells. To test if this strategy to knock-down miRNAs can be applied to other miRNAs, siRNAs against additional pre-miRNAs were transfected into PC-3 cells. miR-16 has two predicted precursors, miR-16–1 and -2. Transfection of siRNA against miR-16–1 and -2 (si16–1 and -2) decreased the mature miRNA to 40 and 60%, respectively (Fig. 2B). Thus, ∼60% of mature miR-16 is derived from the precursor -1, and the rest is from precursor -2. Consistent with this interpretation, co-transfection of the two siRNAs against miR-16 decreased the level of miR-16 to ∼20%, which is close to the background level. Efficient knock-down of miR-15a was also achieved by the transfection of siRNA against the loop region of the corresponding pre-miRNA. Titration of siRNA dose revealed that siRNA concentration of 0.32–1 μm was required to decrease the miRNA levels (Fig. 2B). This dose is higher than the amount of siRNA required to knock down a typical mRNA (0.02–0.3 μm). The lower the efficiency of the siRNA-directed degradation of a miRNA precursor could be due to the short length and/or transient nature of miRNA precursors. Indeed, the precursors of miRNA were never detected in our primer extension assays, presumably because miRNA precursors are quickly processed into mature miRNA. The inefficiency of siRNA against pre-miRNA might account for the failure of this strategy in two other cell lines, HeLa and DU 145. Nevertheless, the results dictate that an siRNA can be used to deplete a miRNA in at least some cell lines like PC-3. To investigate the biological effect of miR-125b, cell proliferation was measured after depletion of miR-125b by RNA interference (Fig. 3A). si125b-2, but not si125b-1, reduced proliferation of PC-3 cells. Growth was restored by the co-introduction of a synthetic mature miR-125b that was designed not to anneal to si125b-2, demonstrating that growth suppression is specifically caused by the depletion of miR-125b. This result also indicates that miRNA function can be provided to cells by transient transfection of single-stranded RNA. Tera-2 EC cells did not express miR-125b, and accordingly, si125b-2 did not suppress growth of Tera-2 cells. To eliminate a trivial explanation, we demonstrated that the RNA interference machinery is intact in Tera-2 cells by transfecting siRNA against ORC2 in this cell line and measuring Orc2 protein level (Fig. 3B). Thus, the failure of si125b-2 to suppress Tera-2 cell proliferation is not due to absence of the siRNA machinery and provides an additional control against nonspecific effects of si125b-2 in PC-3 cells. To confirm that the proliferation defect in Fig. 3A is specifically caused by miR-125b depletion and to test if this defect is seen in cell lines other than PC-3, the experiment was repeated after transfection of 2′-O-methyl antisense oligonucleotide against miR-125b. Again, depletion of miR-125b by 2′-O-methyl oligonucleotide resulted in the reduction of proliferation, whereas the transfection of 2′-O-methyl oligonucleotide against GL2 did not (Fig. 3C). In addition, this proliferation defect was observed not only in PC-3 cells but also in HeLa cells. Because identical results were obtained from two independent methods and each experiment was performed with stringent controls, it is clear that miR-125b is essential for the proliferation of differentiated cells. miR-125b and let-7 Increase, Whereas lin-28 and lin-41 Decrease at mRNA Levels during Differentiation—Taken together with the expression profiles of the human miRNAs in Fig. 1, the previous results in C. elegans (17Reinhart B.J.

To test whether this regulation could be recapitulated in mammalian in vitro differentiation systems, we induced the differentiation of Tera-2 cells in the neuronal direction by retinoic acid (45Thompson S. Stern P.L. Webb M. Walsh F.S. Engstrom W. Evans E.P. Shi W.K. Hopkins B. Graham C.F. J. Cell Sci. 1984; 72: 37-64Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). miR-125b became pronounced after 20 days of retinoic acid treatment (Fig. 4, left panel). let-7 increased to a level barely detectable after 20 days and to a higher level after 60 days. This time pattern was reminiscent of C. elegans in which lin-4 is expressed earlier than let-7 during development (17Reinhart B.J. Slack F.J. Basson M. Pasquinelli A.E. Bettinger J.C. Rougvie A.E.

In contrast to the miRNAs, Lin-28 protein decreased to barely detectable levels after 20 days. Also, the mRNA of lin-28 and lin-41 disappeared completely by 20 days of retinoic acid (Fig. 4, left panel). Thus, the regulation of the miRNAs and their targets was recapitulated in the differentiation of EC cells in vitro. To confirm the changes in expression of miRNAs and their targets in a second differentiation system, we induced the differentiation of mouse ES cells to the neuronal fate using the five-stage in vitro differentiation procedure (34Lee S.H.

However, factors that control this process remain unidentified. Here we show that members of the neuroligin (NLG) family, including NLG1, NLG2, and NLG3, drive the formation of both excitatory and inhibitory presynaptic contacts. The enrichment of endogenous NLG1 at excitatory contacts and NLG2 at inhibitory synapses supports an important in vivo role for these proteins in the development of both types of contacts. Immunocytochemical and electrophysiological analysis showed that the effects on excitatory and inhibitory synapses can be blocked by treatment with a fusion protein containing the extracellular domain of neurexin-1β. We also found that overexpression of PSD-95, a postsynaptic binding partner of NLGs, resulted in a shift in the distribution of NLG2 from inhibitory to excitatory synapses. These findings reveal a critical role for NLGs and their synaptic partners in controlling the number of inhibitory and excitatory synapses. Furthermore, relative levels of PSD-95 alter the ratio of excitatory to inhibitory synaptic contacts by sequestering members of the NLG family to excitatory synapses.

Synapse formation is a tightly regulated process that involves the recruitment of specific cell adhesion molecules and scaffolding proteins to newly formed contacts between an axon and a dendrite (1Kim E.

In the brain, excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission is mainly mediated by two neurotransmitters: glutamate, which is released at excitatory glutamatergic synaptic contacts, and GABA, 1The abbreviations used are: GABA, γ-aminobutyric acid; GFP, green fluorescent protein; HA, hemagglutinin; NLG, neuroligin; VGAT, vesicular GABA transporter; VGLUT, vesicular glutamate transporter; DIV, days in vitro; E/I, excitatory/inhibitory; TBST, Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween 20; mEPSC, miniature excitatory postsynaptic current; mIPSC, miniature inhibitory postsynaptic current; AMPA, α-amino-3-hydroxyl-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionate. 1The abbreviations used are: GABA, γ-aminobutyric acid; GFP, green fluorescent protein; HA, hemagglutinin; NLG, neuroligin; VGAT, vesicular GABA transporter; VGLUT, vesicular glutamate transporter; DIV, days in vitro; E/I, excitatory/inhibitory; TBST, Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween 20; mEPSC, miniature excitatory postsynaptic current; mIPSC, miniature inhibitory postsynaptic current; AMPA, α-amino-3-hydroxyl-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionate. which is released at inhibitory GABAergic synapses. Initial transformation of a contact to either an excitatory or inhibitory synapse is thought to be controlled by spatial and temporal changes in protein content. This process is critical because an appropriate balance between excitatory and inhibitory synapses is required for proper neuronal excitability and function (2Craig A.M. Boudin H. Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 569-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 4Lee S.H. Sheng M. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2000; 10: 125-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 5Ziv N.E. Smith S.J.

However, molecular events that control differentiation of a contact into either an excitatory or inhibitory synapse remain unknown.The postsynaptic density protein, PSD-95, is a molecule that is exclusively localized to glutamatergic synapses and regulates clustering of AMPA receptors through association with stargazin (7El-Husseini A.E. Schnell E. Chetkovich D.M. Nicoll R.A. Bredt D.S. Science. 2000; 290: 1364-1368Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Chen L. Chetkovich D.M. Petralia R.S. Sweeney N.T. Kawasaki Y. Wenthold R.J. Bredt D.S. Nicoll R.A. Nature. 2000; 408: 936-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Through its third PDZ (PSD-95/Dlg/ZO-1) homology domain, PSD-95 also recruits neuroligin-1 (NLG1), a cell adhesion molecule involved in synapse formation (9Ichtchenko K. Hata Y. Nguyen T. Ullrich B. Missler M. Moomaw C. Sudhof T.C. Cell. 1995; 81: 435-443Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar, 10Irie M. Hata Y. Takeuchi M. Ichtchenko K. Toyoda A. Hirao K. Takai Y. Rosahl T.W.

These findings indicate that association of PSD-95 with NLG1 is involved in excitatory synapse development. Recent work by Prange et al. (12Prange O. Wong T.P. Gerrow K. Wang Y.T. El-Husseini A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 13915-13920Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar) showed that NLG1 can drive both excitatory and inhibitory presynaptic contact formation. These results suggested that NLGs are involved in inhibitory synapse formation. Our work also showed that the effects of NLG1 on postsynaptic differentiation were less dramatic. Overexpression of NLG1 modestly increased the total number of excitatory postsynaptic sites but did not enhance clustering of PSD-95 or AMPA receptors (12Prange O. Wong T.P. Gerrow K. Wang Y.T. El-Husseini A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 13915-13920Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). In contrast, coexpression of PSD-95 with NLG1 coordinated the maturation of pre- and postsynaptic elements and the recruitment of AMPA receptors (12Prange O. Wong T.P. Gerrow K. Wang Y.T. El-Husseini A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 13915-13920Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Moreover, enhanced expression of PSD-95 induced changes in the number of excitatory versus inhibitory synapses and resulted in an overall increase in the ratio of excitatory/inhibitory (E/I) synaptic currents (12Prange O. Wong T.P. Gerrow K. Wang Y.T. El-Husseini A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 13915-13920Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). These findings provided the first evidence that assembly of specific postsynaptic elements can regulate a balance between excitatory and inhibitory synapses. Thus, abnormalities in the expression of and/or interactions between these molecules may result in aberrant synapse formation and a change in E/I ratio, which underlie complex psychiatric disorders (13Rubenstein J.L. Merzenich M.M. Genes Brain Behav. 2003; 2: 255-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1670) Google Scholar). The detection of mutations in NLG3 and NLG4 in autistic patients suggests that synaptic imbalance may underlie autism (14Jamain S. Quach H. Betancur C. Rastam M. Colineaux C. Gillberg I.C. Soderstrom H. Giros B. Leboyer M. Gillberg C. Bourgeron T. Nyden A. Philippe A. Cohen D. Chabane N. Mouren-Simeoni M.C. Brice A. Sponheim E. Spurkland I. Skjeldal O.H. Coleman M. Pearl P.L.

Thus, PSD-95 may similarly control the action of NLG2 and NLG3 in neurons. Binding of NLGs to presynaptic neurexin-1β, a specific isoform of β-neurexin, is required for synaptic contact formation through trans-synaptic heterophilic protein interactions (9Ichtchenko K. Hata Y. Nguyen T. Ullrich B. Missler M. Moomaw C. Sudhof T.C. Cell. 1995; 81: 435-443Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar, 11Brose N.

Cell. 2000; 101: 657-669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (950) Google Scholar). However, it remains unclear whether association of NLGs with β-neurexin is involved in the formation of both excitatory and inhibitory presynaptic contacts. Also, it remains unclear whether NLGs are localized to both excitatory and inhibitory synapses and whether PSD-95 modulates the E/I ratio through regulated distribution of these proteins.To elucidate the events that regulate synaptic specificity, we have analyzed the role of NLGs and PSD-95 in this process. We show that NLG1, NLG2, and NLG3 are capable of inducing both excitatory and inhibitory presynaptic contact formation. The effect on inhibitory synapses was blocked by a soluble form of neurexin-1β. Moreover, enhanced expression of PSD-95 induced clustering of NLG2 and NLG3 and shifted endogenous NLG2 from inhibitory to excitatory synapses. These results demonstrate that members of the NLG family are involved in establishing excitatory and inhibitory synapses; however, association with postsynaptic scaffolding proteins regulates the distribution of NLGs and controls the type of synapses formed.MATERIALS AND METHODScDNA Cloning and Mutagenesis—The hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged wild type NLG1 (1ab splice variant) amplified from mouse cerebellum was a gift from Dr. Peter Scheiffele (Columbia University). The generation of GW1 PSD-95 fused to GFP was previously described (18Craven S.E. El-Husseini A.E. Bredt D.S. Neuron. 1999; 22: 497-509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 19El-Husseini A.E. Craven S.E. Chetkovich D.M. Firestein B.L. Schnell E. Aoki C. Bredt D.S. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 159-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). The generation of NLG2 and NLG3 constructs was carried out by PCR using oligonucleotides containing BglII and HindIII restriction sites (NLG2, GGGCCCAGATCTCGGGGAGGAGGGGGTCCC and GGGCCCAAGCTTCTATACCCGAGTGGTGGA; NLG3, GGGCCCAGATCTGCCAGTACCCAGGCCCCG and GGGCCCAAGCTTCTATACACGGGTAGTGGA) and subcloning the resulting fragments into pEGFP-C1 containing the NLG1 signal sequence followed by GFP (12Prange O. Wong T.P. Gerrow K. Wang Y.T. El-Husseini A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 13915-13920Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). The final HA-tagged versions were made by removing GFP (using AgeI and BglII) and inserting an HA tag.Neuronal Cell Culture and Transfections—Dissociated primary neuronal cultures were prepared from hippocampi of embryonic day 18 or 19 Wistar rats. The hippocampi were dissociated by enzymatic papain digestion followed by brief mechanical trituration. The cells were plated on poly-d-lysine (Sigma)-treated glass coverslips. The cultures were maintained in neurobasal medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with B27, penicillin, streptomycin, and l-glutamine as described by Brewer et al. (37Brewer G.J. Torricelli J.R. Evege E.K. Price P.J. Neurosci. Res. 1993; 35: 567-576Crossref Scopus (1895) Google Scholar). Hippocampal cultures were transfected by lipid-mediated gene transfer using the Lipofectamine 2000 agent (Invitrogen) or by the calcium phosphate method (Clontech) at least 2 days prior to immunostaining.Immunocytochemistry—The coverslips were removed from culture wells and fixed in –20 °C methanol. The cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.3% Triton-X-100 before each antibody incubation. The following primary antibodies were used (immunoreactivity and dilution as indicated): HA (mouse, 1:1000; BABCO), GFP (guinea pig, 1:1000), NLG1 (mouse, 1:1000; gift from Dr. Nils Brose), NLG2 (goat, 1:50; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), VGLUT (rabbit, 1:1000; Synaptic Systems), VGAT (rabbit, 1:1000; Synaptic Systems), PSD-95 (1:500; Affinity BioReagents), and Shank (guinea pig, 1:500; gift from Dr. Morgan Sheng). Appropriate fluorescently conjugated secondary antibodies were used as previously described (12Prange O. Wong T.P. Gerrow K. Wang Y.T. El-Husseini A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 13915-13920Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). All of the antibody reactions were performed in blocking solution (2% normal goat or horse serum) for 1 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C. The coverslips were then mounted on slides (Frost Plus; Fisher) with Fluoromount-G (Southern Biotechnology Associates, Birmingham, AL).Western Blotting and Application of Neurexin Fusion Protein—For immunoblotting, the protein samples were harvested in lysis buffer containing 25 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma), 0.8% Triton X-100, 0.2% SDS, and 1 protease inhibitor mixture tablet/10 ml (Roche Applied Science). The samples were boiled for 10 min in loading buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, 2% SDS, 1% β-mercaptoethanol, 7.5% glycerol, 15 μm bromphenol blue), and the proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Biosciences). Nonspecific binding was blocked by incubating membranes with 3% bovine serum albumin in Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST) for 1 h. After three washes in TBST, primary antibodies (HA: mouse, 1:1000; NLG2: goat, 1:250) were diluted in 3% bovine serum albumin in TBST, and the membranes were incubated for 1 h at room temperature. The membranes were washed three times in TBST, incubated with secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (anti-mouse, 1:2000, Amersham Biosciences; anti-goat, 1:5000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The blots were visualized by use of ECL (Pierce). Purification of soluble neurexin-1β fusion protein and the control FC-IgG protein was carried out as described by Ushkaryov et al. (38Ushkaryov Y.A. Hata Y. Ichtchenko K. Moomaw C. Afendis S. Slaughter C.A. Sudhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11987-11992Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For treatment using the purified proteins, the neurons were transfected with the appropriate construct. Transfection medium was then replaced with neurobasal medium containing either vehicle only (Hanks' balanced salt solution), neurexin-1β fusion protein, or FC-IgG (for each well of neurons, ∼8 μl of each was added to 500 μl of neurobasal medium).Imaging and Analysis—The images were acquired on a Zeiss Axiovert M200 motorized microscope by using a monochrome 14-bit Zeiss AxiocamHR charge-coupled device camera. In some experiments, the exposure times were individually adjusted to yield an optimum brightness of immunofluorescent clusters without saturation. In other experiments, the images were acquired with equal exposure and scaled to the same extent, without saturation. For analysis of cluster density (number), the images were analyzed in Northern Eclipse (Empix Imaging, Missasauga, Canada), by using custom written software routines as previously described (12Prange O. Wong T.P. Gerrow K. Wang Y.T. El-Husseini A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 13915-13920Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Briefly, the images were processed at a constant threshold level (of 32,000 pixel values) to create a binary image, and dendrites of the cell of interest were outlined by using fluorescence signal. Only clusters with average pixel values two times greater than corresponding background pixel values were used for analysis. The number of stained clusters was measured as a function of dendritic length. For analysis of changes in NLG2 localization, puncta from the NLG2 channel were manually outlined, and the intensity of each punctum was subtracted from the dendritic background intensity value and multiplied by punctum area to obtain an integrated intensity. In the case of cells transfected with PSD-95 GFP, each punctum on the NLG2 channel was then scored for colocalization with either PSD-95 GFP or VGAT puncta. Mean intensity of NLG2 puncta colocalizing with PSD-95 GFP was then compared with that of NLG2 puncta colocalizing with VGAT, and a ratio was obtained. In the case of untransfected controls, the same process was conducted for VGLUT-positive or -negative NLG2 puncta. The ratios for PSD-95 GFP-transfected cells were then compared with those for untransfected controls. For statistical analyses, Mann-Whitney U or Wilcoxin signed ranks tests were used.Electrophysiology—Recording of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) and miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSCs) were performed at least 2 days post-transfection. Hippocampal neurons on coverslips were transferred to a recording chamber that was continuously perfused with extracellular solution (pH 7.4; 320–330 mOsm) containing 140 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1.3 mm CaCl2, 25 mm HEPES, 33 mm glucose, and 0.0005 mm tetrodotoxin (Alomone Labs). Transfected cells were identified from their GFP signal under a fluorescence upright microscope. Patch pipettes were pulled from borosilicate glass capillaries (Sutter Instrument) and filled with an intracellular solution (pH 7.2; 300–310 mOsm), composed of 115 mm cesium gluconate, 17.5 mm CsCl, 10 mm HEPES, 2 mm MgCl2, 10 mm EGTA, 4 mm ATP, 0.1 mm GTP, and 0.1% Lucifer Yellow (Sigma). An Axopatch 200B amplifier (Axon Instruments) was used for the recording. The access resistance was monitored throughout each experiment. Recordings with a series resistance variation of more than 10% were rejected. No electronic compensation for series resistance was used. Whole cell patch clamp recordings were performed in voltage clamp mode, and the membrane potential was maintained at either the reversal potential for GABAA receptor-mediated mIPSCs (–60 mV) to isolate mEPSCs or at the reversal potential for ionotropic glutamate receptor-mediated mEPSCs (+10 mV) to isolate mIPSCs. The recorded spontaneous mIPSCs and mEPSCs were blocked completely by the GABAA receptor antagonist bicuculline (Sigma) and by the ionotropic glutamate receptor antagonist cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (Sigma), respectively (data not shown). Recordings were low pass filtered at 2 kHz, sampled at 10 kHz, and stored in a PC using Clampex 8.2 (Axon). The t test was used for statistical analysis.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONNeuroligins Drive Excitatory and Inhibitory Presynaptic Contact Formation—Previous work showed that NLG1 drives excitatory synapse formation (17Scheiffele P. Fan J. Choih J. Fetter R. Serafini T. Cell. 2000; 101: 657-669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (950) Google Scholar). However, recently we have revealed the surprising finding that NLG1 overexpression can also induce inhibitory presynaptic contact formation (12Prange O. Wong T.P. Gerrow K. Wang Y.T. El-Husseini A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 13915-13920Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). These results suggest that NLG1 may be involved in vivo in establishing both excitatory and inhibitory synapses. NLG2 and NLG3 are two other known members of the NLG family expressed in the brain (20Ichtchenko K. Nguyen T. Südhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2676-2682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). To explore whether the effect on inhibitory synapses is unique to NLG1, we analyzed the effects of HA-tagged NLG2 (HA-NLG2) and NLG3 (HA-NLG3) on both excitatory and inhibitory synapse formation. For this analysis, days in vitro (DIV) 5 hippocampal neurons were transfected with HA-NLG2 and HA-NLG3, fixed at DIV 8, and stained for either the vesicular γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) transporter (VGAT), a marker for inhibitory synapses, or VGLUT, a marker for excitatory synapses. Remarkably, HA-NLG2 and HA-NLG3 overexpression significantly enhanced the average number of contacting presynaptic boutons, both excitatory (1.6 ± 0.1-fold for HA-NLG2 and 1.5 ± 0.2-fold for HA-NLG3) and inhibitory (3.0 ± 0.9-fold for HA-NLG2 and 2.7 ± 0.4-fold for HA-NLG3), when compared with GFP-transfected cells (Fig. 1). Other changes observed include enhanced numbers of dendritic filopodia (data not shown). These results demonstrate that various members of the NLG family exert similar effects on establishing new synaptic contacts, regardless of type.NLG-induced Inhibitory Synapse Formation Is Mediated by Neurexin-1β—The differential recruitment of proteins to their respective synaptic compartments is likely to be mediated by heterotypic trans-synaptic signaling. NLGs have been shown to associate with neurexin-1β, and this interaction leads to the recruitment of elements required for the structural reorganization of presynaptic compartments (10Irie M. Hata Y.

Cell. 1998; 94: 773-782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). Work performed by Dean et al. (22Dean C. Scholl F.G. Choih J. DeMaria S. Berger J. Isacoff E. Scheiffele P. Nat. Neurosci. 2003; 6: 708-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar) demonstrated that synapse formation involves direct interaction between NLG1 and neurexin-1β and that the effects of NLG1 on excitatory synapses are blocked using an FC fusion protein containing the extracellular domain of neurexin-1β (17Scheiffele P. Fan J. Choih J. Fetter R. Serafini T. Cell. 2000; 101: 657-669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (950) Google Scholar). However, it remains unclear how NLGs influence the maturation of GABA presynaptic terminals. Previous studies showed that β-neurexins are also expressed by inhibitory neurons (23Ullrich B. Ushkaryov Y.A. Sudhof T.C. Neuron. 1995; 14: 497-507Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Moreover, recent work by Graf et al. (24Graf E.R. Zhang X. Jin S.X. Linhoff M.W. Craig A.M. Cell. 2004; 119: 1013-1026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar) showed that expression of neurexin-1β in nonneuronal cells can drive clustering of NLGs and several other excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic proteins in neurons. To examine whether NLG interaction with neurexin-1β is required for inhibitory synapse formation in vivo, DIV 6 neurons were transfected with either HA-NLG1 or HA-NLG2 and then incubated in a medium containing either vehicle solution, 30 μg/ml FC-IgG (control), or 30 μg/ml of a soluble form of neurexin-1β lacking splice site 4 fused to FC-IgG (NXN-FC; Supplemental Fig. 1). Two days post-transfection, the neurons were fixed and analyzed for induction of inhibitory synapses. Remarkably, inhibitory synapse formation mediated by either NLG1 or NLG2 was dramatically diminished upon incubation with NXN-FC (Fig. 2 and Supplemental Fig. 1). This was manifested by a decrease in the number of VGAT-positive puncta contacting dendrites of cells transfected with either construct as compared with vehicle-treated controls (Fig. 2, A and B; 34 ± 7% of control for NLG1 and 39 ± 9% of control for NLG2). Moreover, no significant effect of FC-IgG treatment was observed (Fig. 2B). These results show that a neurexin-1β-dependent interaction regulates NLG-induced inhibitory synapse formation. Significantly, treatment of GFP-transfected cells with NXN-FC resulted in a decrease in the number of inhibitory synapses (51 ± 9% of control) when compared with GFP cells treated with vehicle only (Fig. 2C and Supplemental Fig. 1C). This is further evidence that neurexin-1β is involved in the formation of inhibitory synapses in vivo.Fig. 2NLG-induced inhibitory synapse formation involves neurexin-1β. DIV 6 hippocampal neurons were transfected with either HA-NLG1 or HA-NLG2 and incubated with medium containing 30 μg/ml FC-IgG, 30 μg/ml FC-neurexin-1β peptide (NXN-FC), or Hanks' balanced salt solution (vehicle) only. The cells were fixed 2 days following treatment and then immunostained with HA and VGAT antibodies. A and B, addition of NXN-FC results in a decrease in the number of VGAT-positive terminals contacting dendrites of HA-NLG1 (vehicle, n = 10; FC-IgG, n = 8; NXN-FC, n = 11) or HA-NLG2 (vehicle, n = 10; FC-IgG, n = 13; NXN-FC, n = 10) transfected cells. B, quantification of changes in number of VGAT-positive terminals contacting transfected cells presented as a percentage of control (vehicle; dotted line).

Scale bars, 10 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Treatment with NXN-FC also induced aggregation of HA-NLG1 and HA-NLG2 (Supplemental Fig. 2). This phenomenon is consistent with that observed in the case of the integrin transmembrane cell-adhesion receptors, where ligand binding induces aggregation of the receptor (25Miyamoto S. Akiyama S.K. Yamada K.M. Science. 1995; 267: 883-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar). Interestingly, NLG clusters were present at sites positive for PSD-95 but lacking synaptophysin staining, indicating nonsynaptic localization (Supplemental Fig. 2, B and C). Similar coclustering of NLGs and PSD-95 by neurexin-1β was recently reported (24Graf E.R. Zhang X. Jin S.X. Linhoff M.W. Craig A.M. Cell. 2004; 119: 1013-1026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar). The aggregation of NLGs and PSD-95 upon treatment with NXN-FC is intriguing because NLG expression alone was not sufficient to enhance PSD-95 clustering (Supplemental Fig. 2A). Further work is required to clarify these differences.Functional Effects of Neurexin-1β on Excitatory and Inhibitory Synapses—To examine functional correlates of the immunocytochemical changes induced by application of NXN-FC fusion protein, an electrophysiological approach was taken (Fig. 3). DIV 8–9 hippocampal neurons were transfected with either GFP alone or HA-NLG1 and incubated with either NXN-FC or FC-IgG for 2–3 days. Changes in mEPSCs and mIPSCs were compared by using whole cell voltage clamp recordings (Fig. 3A). Ectopic expression of HA-NLG1 in cells treated with control peptide (FC-IgG) significantly increases the frequency of mEPSCs and mIPSCs compared with GFP transfected cells (Fig. 3, B and C, upper panels). Strikingly, the effects on both mEPSCs and mIPSCs were blocked by treatment with NXN-FC. In addition, NXN-FC treatment reduced basal frequency of mEPSCs and mIPSCs in cells transfected with GFP alone. These results parallel our immunocytochemical data and support a novel role for β-neurexins in the induction of inhibitory synapses. Importantly, treatment of HA-NLG1 transfected cells with NXN-FC increases the ratio of E/I synaptic currents (∼4-fold), suggesting that β-neurexins play a more critical role in inhibitory synapse formation.Fig. 3Blocking neurexin-1β function diminishes NLG1-mediated excitatory and inhibitory synaptic function. Shown are electrophysiological recordings from cultured rat hippocampal neurons coexpressing HA-NLG1 and GFP, or GFP alone, and incubated with medium containing either 30 μg/ml FC-IgG or 30 μg/ml neurexin-1β-FC peptide (NXN-FC). Spontaneous mEPSCs and mIPSCs were recorded in voltage clamp mode at holding potentials of –60 mV and +10 mV, respectively. A, representative traces of mEPSCs (left) and mIPSCs (right) recorded from these neurons. B and C, both the mEPSC and mIPSC frequencies were enhanced in neurons expressing HA-NLG1 when compared with neurons transfected with GFP alone. In contrast, treatment of HA-NLG1 expressing cells with NXN-FC resulted in a significant reduction in both mEPSC and mIPSC frequency when compared with FC-IgG treated controls. Moreover, NXN-FC"

GM-CSF in the presence of RANKL and macrophage colony-stimulating factor resulted in mononuclear cells that were negative for tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) and negative for bone resorption. CD1a, a dendritic cell marker, was expressed in GM-CSF, RANKL, and macrophage colony-stimulating factor-treated cells and absent in osteoclasts. Microarray showed that the CC chemokine, monocyte chemotactic protein 1 (MCP-1), was profoundly repressed by GM-CSF. Addition of MCP-1 reversed GM-CSF suppression of osteoclast formation, recovering the bone resorption phenotype. MCP-1 and chemokine RANTES (regulated on activation normal T cell expressed and secreted) permitted formation of TRAP-positive multinuclear cells in the absence of RANKL. However, these cells were negative for bone resorption. In the presence of RANKL, MCP-1 significantly increased the number of TRAP-positive multinuclear bone-resorbing osteoclasts (p = 0.008). When RANKL signaling through NFATc1 was blocked with cyclosporin A, both MCP-1 and RANTES expression was down-regulated. Furthermore, addition of MCP-1 and RANTES reversed the effects of cyclosporin A and recovered the TRAP-positive multinuclear cell phenotype.

Osteoclasts are bone-resorbing cells that differentiate from hematopoietic precursors of the monocyte/macrophage lineage (1Sakiyama H. Masuda R. Inoue N. Yamamoto K. Kuriiwa K. Nakagawa K. Yoshida K. J. Bone Miner. Metab. 2001; 19: 220-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar).

Receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand (RANKL) and macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) are necessary signals for osteoclast differentiation (2Takahashi N. Udagawa N. Suda T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 256: 449-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). RANKL is present on the surface of stromal cells and osteoblasts (3Wong B.R. Rho J. Arron J. Robinson E.

Authentic human osteoclasts that have high bone-resorbing activity are made in vitro from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) by culturing with M-CSF and recombinant RANKL (M+R treatment).

Chemokines are small cytokines known to be involved in immune response and in development of several cell types (12Horuk R. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2001; 12: 313-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Chemokines are classified into two main subfamilies, CC and CXC, according to the location of the first two of the four cysteine residues (13Gosling J. Slaymaker S. Gu L. Tseng S. Zlot C.H. Young S.G. Rollins B.J. Charo I.F. J. Clin. Investig. 1999; 103: 773-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). Many ligands within the CC chemokine superfamily are capable of sharing receptors (12Horuk R. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2001; 12: 313-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Monocyte chemotactic protein 1 (MCP-1) is a CC chemokine commonly found at the site of tooth eruption, rheumatoid arthritic bone degradation, and bacterially induced bone loss (14Wise G.E. Frazier-Bowers S. D'Souza R.N. Crit. Rev. Oral. Biol. Med. 2002; 13: 323-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). MCP-1 is expressed by mature osteoclasts, and its expression is regulated by nuclear factor-κB (15Cappellen D. Luong-Nguyen N.H. Bongiovanni S. Grenet O. Wanke C. Susa M. J. Biol.

In this report we show that GM-CSF suppresses the formation of TRAP-positive multinuclear osteoclasts by RANKL and M-CSF. Gene expression studies show that GM-CSF treatment causes potent down-regulation of MCP-1. Addition of exogenous MCP-1 reversed the GM-CSF-mediated suppression of osteoclast formation, permitting the recovery of authentic multinuclear bone-resorbing osteoclasts. Preparation and Culture of Human Monocytes—Human PBMCs were isolated by Ficoll-Paque (Amersham Biosciences) density gradient centrifugation as previously described (9Day C.J. Kim M.S. Simcock W.E. Stephens S.R.J. Aitken C.J. Nicholson G.C. Morrison N.A. J. Cell. Biochem. 2004; 91: 303-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). PBMCs were plated at 106 cells/cm2 and non-adherent cells removed by washing in normal saline. Cells were cultured in minimal essential medium (supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Invitrogen)), 5% CO2 supplemented with 25 ng/ml M-CSF and 20 ng/ml soluble RANKL to induce osteoclast formation. GM-CSF was used at concentrations from 0.1 to 25 ng/ml. MCP-1 and RANTES were used at 25 ng/ml. Neutralizing antibody directed against MCP-1 was used at 4 μg/ml according to the manufacturer's protocols. Control antibody was goat anti-rabbit IgG used at 10 μg/ml (Serotec). GM-CSF, RANKL, M-CSF, MCP-1, RANTES, and neutralizing anti-MCP-1 antibody were purchased from Peprotech (Rocky Hill, NJ). All data are based on a minimum of three replicate experiments performed independently on different occasions, unless otherwise stated. All cultures were for 21 days. After 21 days, PBMC cultures were fixed in acetone, citrate, and formaldehyde solution and stained for TRAP using a leukocyte acid phosphatase staining kit (Sigma). TRAP-positive cells that had three or more nuclei were considered multinuclear. Bone resorption assays were performed on dentine slices in 96-well plates as previously described (11Hodge J.M.

Dentine slices were sputter-coated with gold and observed by scanning electron microscopy. Flow Cytometry Analysis of CD1a Expression—Cells cultured on BioCoat collagen I plates (BD Biosciences) for 21 days were dissociated using cell dissociation buffer (Invitrogen), incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated human CD1a antibody (Chemicon, Temecula, CA) for 45 min on ice, and washed with phosphate-buffered saline prior to flow cytometry (FACS Calibur; BD Biosciences). The unstained cells were gated out and data acquisition and analysis were done using CellQuest software (BD Biosciences). RNA Studies—At 21 days, cultures were lysed using 4 m guanidium isothiocyanate, 1% lauryl sarcosine, and total RNA pelleted through a 5.7 m cesium chloride, 100 mm EDTA cushion by ultracentrifugation in a Beckman SW41 rotor at 27,000 rpm for 16 h (17Sambrook J.

Gene arrays containing 19,000 duplicate spotted cDNA representing human genes were hybridized and analyzed according to the manufacturer's protocols (University of Ontario Cancer Center). Statistical Analysis—Analysis of variance with Fisher's post hoc t test was used to determine significance of effects. Data are presented as mean values ± S.E. Phenotype of Cells Treated with GM-CSF in the Presence of RANKL and M-CSF—We clarified the effect of continuous exposure of human PBMC to GM-CSF on osteoclast differentiation mediated by M+R treatment (Fig. 1). The appearance of TRAP-positive multinuclear cells was suppressed dose dependently by GM-CSF, with osteoclast differentiation suppressed up to 97% by exposure to 25 ng/ml GM-CSF (Fig. 1A). Furthermore, delayed addition of GM-CSF had similar suppressive effects (Fig. 1B). Whereas normal osteoclasts differentiated using M+R treatment were TRAP-positive and multinuclear with potent bone resorption (Fig. 1C), cultures treated with maximal doses of GM-CSF and M+R treatment were TRAP-negative, mononuclear, and completely negative for bone resorption (Fig. 1C). To further characterize the phenotype of cells treated with GM-CSF in the presence of RANKL and M-CSF, the expression of a series of osteoclast-related genes was examined (Fig. 2A). Gene expression profiles were compared between osteoclasts (M+R treatment, 25 ng/ml M-CSF and 20 ng/ml RANKL), macrophage-like cells (M-CSF-alone treatment, 25 ng/ml), and cells derived from continuous treatment with GM-CSF (25 ng/ml) with RANKL and M-CSF (GMR treatment) as above. The GM-CSF receptor-α was induced in osteoclasts relative to macrophages and was further up-regulated in GMR treatment (Fig. 2A). The up-regulation of GM-CSF receptor-α by RANKL provides an explanation why delayed addition of GM-CSF is still potent at suppressing osteoclast differentiation, because cells may be sensitized to inhibition by increased receptor. We previously established a series of nuclear factors, including NFATc1, that are regulated strongly by RANKL during osteoclast differentiation (9Day C.J. Kim M.S. Simcock W.E. Stephens S.R.J. Aitken C.J. Nicholson G.C. Morrison N.A. J. Cell. Biochem. 2004; 91: 303-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). These nuclear factors show pronounced differential patterns of expression in the three treatment groups (Fig. 2A). In particular, the RANKL-mediated induction of NFATc1 is suppressed by GM-CSF in GMR-treated cells relative to osteoclasts. Because NFATc1 is considered necessary for induction of osteoclast genes (16Ishida N. Hayashi K. Hoshijima M. Ogawa T. Koga S. Miyatake Y. Kumegawa M. Kimura T. Takeya T. J. Biol.

Cell. 2002; 3: 889-901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1965) Google Scholar), inhibition of NFATc1 induction provides a rationale for the suppression of the osteoclast phenotype by GM-CSF. In contrast, the potent RANKL-mediated induction of far upstream element-binding protein was essentially unaffected by GM-CSF in GMR treatment compared with M+R treatment. Other osteoclast nuclear factors, GABPα and ILF3, were potently down-regulated by GM-CSF, similar to the effect on NFATc1. Although subunits of the same factor, GABPα and GABPβ were differentially down-regulated in GMR-treated cells. KOX31 is a zinc finger protein that is highly expressed in macrophage-like cells and repressed in osteoclasts (9Day C.J. Kim M.S. Simcock W.E. Stephens S.R.J. Aitken C.J. Nicholson G.C. Morrison N.A. J. Cell. Biochem. 2004; 91: 303-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). GM-CSF does not reverse the RANKL-mediated repression of KOX31; in fact, KOX31 is further repressed in GMR-treated cells relative to M+R treatment (Fig. 2A). The further repression of KOX31 by GMR eliminates any similarity between the M-CSF-treated cells and the GMR-treated cells, because potent up-regulation of KOX31 occurs in macrophage-like cells. The overall pattern of gene expression indicates that GMR-treated cells are not similar to M-CSF-derived macrophage-like cells and probably represent a dendritic cell phenotype, because the dendritic marker CD1a (20Kasinrerk W. Baumruker T. Majdic O. Knapp W. Stockinger H. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 579-584PubMed Google Scholar) was up-regulated in GMR treatment (Fig. 2, B and C). GM-CSF Suppresses RANKL-mediated Induction of MCP-1—Because GMR treatment suppressed NFATc1, we hypothesized that GM-CSF in the presence of RANKL and M-CSF inhibits the induction of key factors in osteoclast differentiation. Such factors would appear suppressed by GMR treatment compared with M+R treatment. A large number of genes demonstrated significant differential expression in microarray analysis (data not shown), although only a few are discussed. The expression of various genes was consistent with suppression of the osteoclast phenotype by GM-CSF: cathepsin D, vacuolar H+ ATPase proton pump (ATP6C), NFATc1, and the osteoclast protease cathepsin K were repressed (data not shown). The GM-CSF receptor-α was up-regulated, in keeping with the real-time PCR analysis (Fig. 2A). Of 19,000 genes assayed, the gene most repressed by GMR treatment in comparison to M+R treatment was MCP-1, a CC chemokine not associated previously with osteoclast differentiation. To verify the regulation of MCP-1 by GM-CSF, new cultures were established on three separate occasions, differentiated over 21 days under comparable conditions with M-CSF alone, M+R, and GMR treatment (Fig. 2D). MCP-1 mRNA content, measured by quantitative real-time PCR, was 17.1 ± 0.1 (copies/ng total RNA) in M+R cultures compared with 0.24 ± 0.06 in GMR-treated cultures, meaning that GM-CSF treatment results in a 72-fold decrease in MCP-1 mRNA (p = 5 × 10–9). Furthermore, MCP-1 was induced by RANKL during osteoclast differentiation (15-fold) compared with macrophage cultures (M-CSF-alone treatment). These data confirm that GM-CSF represses MCP-1 expression in the GMR treatment compared with M+R and also show that MCP-1 is induced in osteoclasts relative to macrophage-like cells. Another CC chemokine, RANTES, is induced during human (9Day C.J. Kim M.S. Simcock W.E. Stephens S.R.J. Aitken C.J. Nicholson G.C. Morrison N.A. J. Cell.

Chemokine Effects on Osteoclasts—We reasoned that exogenous MCP-1 would affect osteoclast differentiation. Adding MCP-1 to the standard M+R treatment protocol resulted in 33% more osteoclasts (329 ± 26 n = 14 versus 252 ± 13 n = 19, respectively; p = 0.008) (Fig. 3A) that were TRAP-positive and positive for bone resorption (Fig. 3B). Unexpectedly, MCP-1 treatment with M-CSF in the absence of exogenous RANKL resulted in TRAP-positive, multinucleated giant cells (Fig. 3B). Although these cells had the appearance of osteoclasts, they were unable to form resorption pits on dentine, suggesting that MCP-1 and M-CSF treatment results in an intermediate phenotype on the path to osteoclasts, permitting monocyte fusion but not further differentiation. Like MCP-1, RANTES treatment with M-CSF resulted in multinuclear TRAP-positive cells that were unable to degrade bone (Fig. 3D). Unlike MCP-1, exogenous RANTES had no effect on osteoclast number or bone resorption in the presence of RANKL (Fig. 3, C and D). MCP-1-mediated effects were sensitive to specific neutralizing anti-MCP-1 antibody, preventing the MCP-1-mediated enhancement of osteoclast formation observed in M+R-treated cultures and inhibiting the formation of multinuclear cells in cultures treated with MCP-1 and M-CSF (Fig. 3, A and C). Neutralizing anti-MCP-1 antibody significantly reduced the number of osteoclasts in standard M+R cultures (p = 0.01) (Fig. 3C). Control antibody had no effect on osteoclast number (data not shown, p = 0.59). Treatment with MCP-1 and M-CSF resulted in multinuclear cells that had the appearance of osteoclasts but were negative for bone resorption (Fig. 3B). The levels of expression of two osteoclast-related genes, TRAP and cathepsin K, were compared by quantitative PCR in cultures treated with MCP-1 and M-CSF compared with standard M+R treatment (Fig. 3E). The mRNA content of TRAP was virtually identical in the multinuclear TRAP-positive non-bone-resorbing cells from MCP-1 and M-CSF treatment compared with authentic osteoclasts. In contrast, cathepsin K mRNA content was substantially lower in MCP-1- and M-CSF-treated cells. This may provide a rational for the inability of these osteoclast-like TRAP-positive multinuclear cells to degrade bone: cathepsin K and possibly other essential osteoclast-related genes are not appropriately induced in MCP-1-treated cells. MCP-1 Reverses GM-CSF Repression of Osteoclast Differentiation—MCP-1 acts as an enhancer of osteoclast differentiation and was strongly repressed by GM-CSF. We hypothesized that the lack of MCP-1 may be influential in GM-CSF-mediated suppression of osteoclast differentiation from PBMCs. This hypothesis was tested by addition of exogenous MCP-1 under conditions of maximal suppression of osteoclast differentiation by GM-CSF (25 ng/ml). The addition of MCP-1 (at 25 ng/ml) to the GMR treatment protocol dramatically increased the formation of TRAP-positive multinucleate cells (p = 3.8 × 10–8; Fig. 4A). Although the multinuclear cells derived from MCP-1-treated GMR cultures were generally smaller than osteoclasts derived from control M+R-treated cultures (47 ± 4 and 148 ± 22 μm, respectively; average longest axis, p = 2.2 × 10–5), they were almost twice as abundant and were positive for bone resorption (Fig. 4B). Although RANTES overcame the block in multinucleation imposed by GM-CSF, resulting in a similar number of TRAP-positive multinucleate cells as in M+R controls, the cells were negative for bone resorption (Fig. 4B). If MCP-1 and RANTES are involved in cell fusion events, we reasoned that these chemokines should be able to rescue multinuclearity from blockade of osteoclast formation by other chemical agents, such as cyclosporin A, a blocker of NFATc1 activation by calcineurin. We showed in human (9Day C.J. Kim M.S. Simcock W.E. Stephens S.R.J. Aitken C.J. Nicholson G.C. Morrison N.A. J. Cell.

Cell cultures exposed to M+R treatment and maximally repressive concentrations of cyclosporin A (1 μg/ml) showed virtually no multinuclear cells (Fig. 4C). In addition, the differentiation of human osteoclasts on dentine and bone resorption activity is potently inhibited by cyclosporin A at 1 μg/ml (data not shown). In marked contrast, MCP-1 or RANTES addition showed a dramatic recovery of TRAP-positive multinuclear cells in cultures treated with cyclosporin A and M+R (Fig. 4C). These cells have the appearance of osteoclasts but are negative for bone resorption (Fig. 4D). Under cyclosporin A blockade, the RANKL-mediated induction of MCP-1 was repressed completely, consistent with nuclear factor-κB or NFATc1 being responsible for the induction of MCP-1 during osteoclast differentiation (Fig. 4E). RANTES induction was repressed similarly. Cell fate is controlled by relative concentrations of cytokines, integrated over their respective signaling pathways. Without RANKL, M-CSF treatment of monocytes results in macrophage-like cells; therefore, RANKL overrides the macrophage differentiation pathway to form osteoclasts in the presence of RANKL and M-CSF. Likewise, GM-CSF and RANKL represent two competing differentiation signals, RANKL to osteoclasts and GM-CSF to dendritic-like cells. RANKL-dependent up-regulation of GM-CSF receptor-α might provide a negative feedback signal, sensitizing cells to the effect of GM-CSF found in the bone marrow milieu and thus aiding in regulation of osteoclast number. In the presence of RANKL and M-CSF, GM-CSF dominates cell fate and osteoclast differentiation is suppressed, with concomitant suppression of osteoclast-related genes. MCP-1 was the most potently down-regulated gene in microarray analysis of the inhibitory effect of GM-CSF. Furthermore, exogenous MCP-1 was able to recover authentic osteoclasts from GM-CSF inhibition of osteoclast differentiation. In the presence of sufficient MCP-1, the balance of cell fate is changed back toward the RANKL signal, countervailing the GM-CSF repressive signal. We conclude that the absence of MCP-1 in GMR-treated cultures is a key deficit in osteoclast differentiation. Once this deficit is overcome, by adding exogenous MCP-1, osteoclast differentiation can proceed in the presence of RANKL. The smaller size of the osteoclasts formed under these conditions may reflect a further inhibitory effect of GM-CSF on osteoclasts, even after rescue by MCP-1, because the up-regulation of the GM-CSF receptor by RANKL was unaffected by the presence of GM-CSF. To date, MCP-1 has not been implicated in osteoclast function, although data exist on its role in recruitment of monocytes during tooth eruption (14Wise G.E. Frazier-Bowers S. D'Souza R.N. Crit. Rev. Oral. Biol. Med. 2002; 13: 323-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Our data on the effects of MCP-1 and RANTES on osteoclast differentiation may explain why inflammatory diseases that feature increased chemokine activity, such as rheumatoid arthritis, are associated with increased osteoclast activity leading to bone degradation. We demonstrated previously that CCR2, the receptor for MCP-1, is also induced by RANKL, providing evidence for an autocrine cycle involving MCP-1. Furthermore, both MCP-1 and RANTES treatment resulted in multinucleated cells in the absence of RANKL, suggesting that chemokines are sufficient for fusion events. MCP-1 overcomes GM-CSF-mediated repression of osteoclast differentiation, permitting the cells to pass through multinucleation to authentic bone-resorbing osteoclasts. Cyclosporin A and GM-CSF similarly inhibit both osteoclast differentiation and MCP-1 expression; GM-CSF represses NFATc1 induction, whereas cyclosporin A inhibits activation of NFATc1 by blocking calcineurin. Under continuous chemical blockade of NFATc1 by cyclosporin A, a recovery of bone resorption activity would not be expected even if MCP-1 recovered the multinuclear phenotype, unless a calcineurin-independent pathway of NFATc1 activation exists in osteoclasts. As predicted from the continuous blockade of NFATc1 by cyclosporin A, MCP-1 and RANTES were unable to recover the bone resorption phenotype (see Fig. 4D). MCP-1 recovered bone resorption in GM-CSF-inhibited cultures but did not recover bone resorption in cyclosporin A-inhibited cultures. RANTES induction by RANKL was similarly repressed by cyclosporin A, and RANTES treatment of cyclosporin A blockaded M+R-treated cells changed the cell phenotype from TRAP-positive mononuclear to TRAP-positive multinuclear cells. Both MCP-1 and RANTES recover the multinuclear phenotype in cyclosporin A blockade of osteoclast differentiation but do not recover bone resorption, providing evidence that chemokines are involved in cell fusion events during osteoclast differentiation. In our experiments, although MCP-1 and RANTES were associated with cell fusion events, the presence of RANKL was necessary for bone resorption, as treatment with either MCP-1 or RANTES and M-CSF leads to multinuclear cells but not bone resorption. Taken together, these data suggest that RANKL induction of MCP-1 and RANTES is an important component of osteoclast differentiation, providing an autocrine signal acting on the osteoclast and a paracrine signal that acts on osteoclast precursors to accelerate osteoclast differentiation by promoting fusion. The expression of osteoclast marker genes in cells treated with MCP-1 and M-CSF suggests that some osteoclast characteristics can be acquired independently of RANKL. Because RANKL induces the MCP-1 receptor (CCR2), RANKL induction of MCP-1 sets up both autocrine (affecting the osteoclast-producing MCP-1) and paracrine pathways (affecting cells destined to fuse with the RANKL-stimulated osteoclast). We present a model for chemokine action during osteoclast differentiation (Fig. 5). Osteoclasts form by fusion of RANK+ mononuclear precursors after contact with a cell expressing RANKL. Intimate cell-cell contact is necessary in vivo for RANKL signaling, a process mimicked in vitro with soluble recombinant RANKL. An osteoclast precursor cell in contact with a RANKL-presenting cell (Fig. 5) will receive the RANKL signal and initiate a cascade of gene expression that includes the production of MCP-1, RANTES, and possibly other chemokines. MCP-1 and RANTES are chemotactic signals for monocytes, resulting in migration to the source of production of the chemokine. The data show that either MCP-1 or RANTES can cause cell fusion in monocytes treated with M-CSF. We propose that cell fusion is a key event in the next step of osteoclast differentiation (Fig. 5) where monocyte-like cells, that have not yet seen RANKL are attracted by chemokines to the site of coupling of the RANK+ precursor and the RANKL-presenting cell. Chemokine-mediated fusion increases the size of the osteoclast and also transfers the RANKL signal to the additional nuclei that are now in the multinucleated cell. We show that fusion can occur in the absence of RANKL but that bone resorption depends on RANKL. If the chemokine signal is strong enough, such monocyte cell fusion could occur prior to contact with the RANKL-influenced osteoclast precursor. Such TRAP-positive “prefused” cells would still require the RANKL signal to develop into an authentic osteoclast capable of bone resorption because they have a deficit in cathepsin K expression. In conclusion, MCP-1 is induced by RANKL during osteoclast differentiation and is sensitive to cyclosporin A and repressed by GM-CSF but is able to overcome GM-CSF repression of osteoclast differentiation. Furthermore, chemokines stimulate the formation of fused cells in the absence of RANKL and overcome the block in fusion caused by cyclosporin A. These data indicate that chemokines play a crucial role in osteoclast function. We thank G. Nicholson for the kind gift of bone chips."

Although the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) pathway is crucial for mediating cellular TNF responses, the complete spectrum of NF-κB-dependent genes is unknown. In this study, we used a tetracycline-regulated cell line expressing an NF-κB inhibitor to systematically identify NF-κB-dependent genes. A microarray data set generated from a time course of TNF stimulation in the presence or absence of NF-κB signaling was analyzed. We identified 50 unique genes that were regulated by TNF (Pr(F) <0.001) and demonstrated a change in signal intensity of ± 3-fold relative to control. Of these, 28 were NF-κB-dependent, encoding proteins involved in diverse cellular activities. Quantitative real-time PCR assays of eight characterized NF-κB-dependent genes and five genes not previously known to be NF-κB-dependent (Gro-β and-γ, IκBϵ, interleukin (IL)-7R, and Naf-1) were used to determine whether they were directly or indirectly NF-κB regulated. Expression of constitutively active enhanced green fluorescent·NF-κB/Rel A fusion protein transactivated all but IL-6 and IL-7R in the absence of TNF stimulation. Moreover, TNF strongly induced all 12 genes in the absence of new protein synthesis.

J. Investig. Med. 1995; 43: 227-235PubMed Google Scholar). In the respiratory tract, alveolar macrophages encountering invading microorganisms inducibly secrete TNF. TNF, in turn, signals in a paracrine manner to induce expression of epithelial chemokine networks (2Standiford T.J. Kunkel S.L. Basha M.A. Chensue S.W. Lynch J.P.I. Toews G.B. Westwick J. Strieter R.M. J. Clin. Investig. 1990; 86: 1945-1953Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar) and in an endocrine manner to induce the hepatic acute phase response (3Brasier A.R. Li J. J.

In this way, TNF plays a central role in amplifying the host inflammatory response to tissue infection. TNF binds to ubiquitously expressed single pass type I transmembrane receptors of 55 and 75 kDa (TNFR-I and -II, respectively) that lack intrinsic kinase activity (5Smith C.A. Farrah T. Goodwin R.G. Cell. 1994; 76: 959-962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1838) Google Scholar). TNF ligand binding initiates intracellular signaling by inducing the formation of receptor trimers that assemble submembranous protein complexes assembling on the aggregated cytoplasmic TNFR “death domain” (6Hsu H. Xiong J. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1995; 81: 495-504Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1747) Google Scholar). TNFR death domain-binding proteins include the TNFR-associated death domain TRADD (6Hsu H.

Immunity. 1996; 4: 387-396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (980) Google Scholar). Subsequent recruitment of the TNF receptor-associated factor-2 (TRAF2) to the submembranous complex activates two important downstream signaling pathways, the c-Jun N-terminal kinase/p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase activating protein-1 (AP-1) pathway and the inhibitor of κB kinase (IKK)-nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) pathway (8Hsu H.

The IKK complex is an upstream controller of the NF-κB transcription factor (11Karin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (620) Google Scholar). NF-κB is a family of ubiquitously expressed, highly inducible cytoplasmic transcription factors (12Baldwin A.S.J. Annu. Rev.

The prototypical NF-κB complex is maintained in a cytoplasmic localization by association with the IκB inhibitors, whose members bind and specifically inactivate the NF-κB/Rel A subunit, preventing its nuclear entry (Refs. 15Han Y.

Upon IκB degradation, the Rel A/NF-κB1 heterodimer is released to enter the nucleus and stimulate gene expression by binding to regulatory regions of inducible promoters. Previous studies have shown the IKK-NF-κB pathway is critical for mediating the TNF-induced cytokine cascade, because specific inhibitors of IKK-NF-κB pathway block cytokine expression and inflammation in vivo (20May M.J.

In addition, the IKK-NF-κB pathway protects against apoptosis by inducing the expression of a variety of anti-apoptotic genes (10Liu Z-G. Hsu H. Goeddel D.V. Karin M. Cell. 1996; 87: 565-576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1783) Google Scholar). Although previous microarray studies have characterized the genomic responses to TNF (22Zhou A. Scoggin S. Gaynor R.B. Williams N.S. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 2054-2064Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), there has been no systematic evaluation or validation of the spectrum of genes directly under NF-κB control. Earlier we exploited a robust microarray analysis of HeLa cells expressing a tightly tetracycline-regulated NF-κB dominant negative inhibitor to identify NF-κB-dependent genes downstream of respiratory virus replication (23Tian B. Zhang Y. Luxon B.A. Garofalo R.P. Casola A. Sinha M. Brasier A.R. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 6800-6814Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). In this study, we sought to extend this analysis to the TNF pathway. HeLa cells were stimulated for 0, 1, 3, and 6 h with recombinant human (rh) TNFα in the presence or absence of NF-κB signaling to generate a time series data set of genomic responses. Using two-way analysis of variance where TNF and NF-κB inhibition were treated as experimental manipulations, we identified 28 NF-κB-dependent genes encoding diverse biological pathways. Fourteen genes, including six not previously shown to be NF-κB-dependent, were analyzed in detail to determine whether they satisfied independent experimental criteria for being bona fide genomic targets for inducible NF-κB binding and transactivation. This experimentally defined NF-κB-dependent data set furthers our understanding of its genomic and biological actions in inflammatory TNF signaling. Cell Culture, Treatment, and Transfection—The human cervical epithelioid carcinoma cell line HeLa expressing tTA (HeLa Tet-Off) pBI-EGFP·IκBα Mut was constructed earlier (23Tian B. Zhang Y.

HeLa Tet-Off were grown in medium containing 90% Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 4 mml-glutamine, 0.1 mm non-essential amino acids, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 100 mg/ml G418, 100 units/ml penicillin G sodium, and 100 mg/ml streptomycin sulfate in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. For TNF stimulation, freshly isolated cells were split into two cultures, one group maintained in doxycycline (Dox), the other without for 7 days, a time at which IκBα Mut expression was maximal. Thereafter, rhTNFα (25 ng/ml, final concentration) was added directly to the culture medium for the indicated times prior to harvest. Freshly plated cells in triplicate 60-mm plates were transiently transfected using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen), 8 μg of indicated luciferase reporter plasmid, and 3 μg of the constitutive alkaline phosphatase internal control plasmid, pSV2PAP (25Han Y.

Cells were cultured for an additional 40 h and, where indicated, stimulated with rhTNFα for 6 h prior to harvest and assay for reporter activity. -Fold induction of reporter activity was calculated by dividing the mean normalized luciferase activity (relative to alkaline phosphatase) from three treated cultures by the mean normalized luciferase activity from three untreated cultures. Oligonucleotide Probe-based Microarray—Hu95Av2 GeneChip (Affymetrix Inc, Santa Clara, CA) containing 12,626 sequenced human genes was hybridized according to the manufacturer's recommendations and washed using both non-stringent (1 m NaCl, 25 °C) and stringent (1 m NaCl, 50 °C) conditions prior to staining with phycoerythrin streptavidin (10 μg/ml final).

For each gene, 16–20 probe pairs were immobilized as ∼25-mer oligonucleotides that hybridize throughout the mRNA; each probe pair is represented as a perfect match oligonucleotide and a mismatch oligonucleotide as hybridization control. The absolute call (e.g. the gene is detected (“present”) or not (“absent”)) and the signal intensity (measure of mRNA abundance) were determined (26Lipshutz R.J. Fodor S.P.A. Gingeras T.R. Lockhart D.J. Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 20-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (1866) Google Scholar). Data Analysis—Four independent experiments were performed identically including control (0 h) and 1, 3, and 6 h of TNF stimulation (25 ng/ml) in the presence or absence of doxycycline (2 μg/ml) in growth medium. For comparison of the fluorescent intensity (signal intensity) values among multiple experiments, the signal intensity values for each “experimental” GeneChip were scaled to that of the “base” GeneChip. This was done first by calculating the “2% trimmed mean” (a measurement of global signal intensity) for each GeneChip. The trimmed mean is obtained by calculating the mean signal intensity of the chip after discarding the top and bottom 2% average difference values. Next, scaling was performed by multiplying all the signal intensity measurements in the experimental array by a scaling factor defined as the ratio of the base trimmed mean to that of the experimental trimmed mean (the base array was defined to be the 0 h control + Dox GeneChip). An average of 4929 ± 572 probe sets was detected on each GeneChip. The normalization factor ranged from 1.011 to 1.307 (1.18 ± 0.10), and a high degree of reproducibility was observed in analysis of pairwise analysis of signal intensity measurements across the GeneChips. Because both the rhTNFα and Dox can be considered experimental treatments, the scaled average difference values were then subjected to a two-way analysis of variance with replications (ANOVA, Splus 6; Insightful Inc.) to determine which genes were significantly influenced by either the rhTNFα or Dox treatment. -Fold change was calculated as the signed ratio between treatment and control signal intensity. Agglomerative hierarchical clustering was performed using the weighted pair group method with arithmetic mean (Spotfire Array Explorer, version 8; Spotfire Inc., Cambridge MA) using Euclidian distance. To compare genes with different levels of expression, the data were Z-score normalized prior to cluster analysis (27Brasier A.R. Spratt H. Wu Z. Boldogh I. Zhang Y. Garofalo R.P. Casola A. Pashmi J. Haag A. Luxon B. Kurosky A. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 11461-11476Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). 2Primary data available upon request. RNA Quantitation—For Northern hybridization, acid guanidium-phenol-extracted total cellular RNA was fractionated by electrophoresis on a 1.2% agarose-formaldehyde gel, capillary transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Zeta-Probe GT; Bio-Rad), and hybridized with 1–2 × 106 cpm/ml 32P-labeled cDNA as previously described (23Tian B. Zhang Y. Luxon B.A. Garofalo R.P. Casola A. Sinha M. Brasier A.R. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 6800-6814Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The membrane was exposed to XAR film (Kodak) for 24–48 h at 70 °C and quantified by exposure to PhosphorImager cassette. Quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (Q-RT-PCR) assays were developed using TaqMan technology on an Applied Biosystems 7000 sequence detection system. Applied Biosystems assays-by-design or assays-on-demand 20′ assay mix of primers and TaqMan MGB probes (FAM™ dye-labeled) for all our target genes and predeveloped 18 S rRNA (VIC™-dye labeled probe) TaqMan™ assay reagent (P/N 4319413E) for internal control were used for real-time PCR measurements. These assays were designed to span exon-exon junctions so as not to detect genomic DNA. All primers and probe sequences were searched against the Celera data base to confirm specificity. Validation experiments were performed to test the efficiency of the target and reference amplifications. All absolute values of the slope of log input amount versus CT are less than 0.1. Separate tubes (singleplex) for one-step RT-PCR were used with 50 ng of RNA for both target genes and endogenous controls using the TaqMan one-step RT-PCR master mix reagent kit (Applied Biosystems). The cycling parameters for one-step RT-PCR were: reverse transcription 48 °C for 30 min, AmpliTaq activation 95 °C for 10 min, denaturation 95 °C for 15 s, and annealing/extension 60 °C for 1 min (repeat 40 times) on ABI7000. Duplicate CT values were analyzed with Microsoft Excel using the comparative CT(ΔΔCT) method as described by the manufacturer (Applied Biosystems). The amount of target (2–DDCT) was obtained by normalizing to an endogenous reference (18 S RNA) relative to a calibrator (one experimental sample). The primer and probe sequences for IL-6, IL-8, NF-κB1, NF-κB2, IκBα, IκBϵ, Naf-1, TRAF1, and PTGES were obtained commercially (P/N 4331182; Applied Biosystems). For TNFAIP/A20, the probe sequence was 5′-CAATTGCCGTCACCGTTC-3′; the forward primer was 5′-AGCTTGTGGCGCTGAAAAC-3′, and the reverse primer was 5′-ACTGAGAAGTGGCATGCATGAG-3′. Western Immunoblots—For Western immunoblot, a constant amount of cytoplasmic or nuclear extracts (200–300 μg as indicated) was boiled in Laemmli buffer, fractionated on 10% SDS-PAGE, and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA) in CAPS/methanol (25Han Y. Meng T. Murray N.R. Fields A.P. Brasier A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 939-947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Membranes were blocked in 5% milk/Tris-buffered saline 0.1% Tween for 1 h and immunoblotted with primary antibody for 1 h at 4 °C. Primary antibodies used were anti-FLAG M2-peroxidase conjugate (A8592; Sigma), affinity-purified anti-IκBα or anti-Rel A (the latter two from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz CA). Membranes were washed four times in Tris-buffered saline 0.1% Tween 20. Immune complexes were detected by reaction in the enhanced chemiluminescence assay (ECL; Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Equivalent protein loading was confirmed by probing the blot with anti-β-actin (25Han Y. Meng T. Murray N.R. Fields A.P. Brasier A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 939-947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays (EMSAs)—EMSAs were performed as described previously (23Tian B.

Brasier A.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 99-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In brief, 15 μg of nuclear extracts (NE) were incubated with 40,000 cpm of 32P-labeled duplex oligonucleotide probe and 2 μg of poly(dA-dT) in binding buffer. The complexes were fractionated on 6% native polyacrylamide gels, dried, and exposed to Kodak X-AR film at 70 °C. Competition was performed by the addition of 100-fold molar excess nonradioactive double-stranded oligonucleotide competitor at the time of addition of radioactive probe. The double-stranded oligonucleotides contained 5′-GATC overhangs. The sense core sequences used were APRE WT: 5′-CACCACAGTTGGGATTTCCCAACCTGACCA-3′; Rel B WT: 5′-CCGCCGGGGAATTCCGCCA-3′; IκBϵ WT: 5′-CATAATGGGAGTCCCCTTTA-3′; Naf-1 WT: 5′-CTCCGGGGACTTTCCCAGGGA-3′; Naf-1Mut: 5′-CTCCGTTTACTTGAAAAGGGGA-3′; B94 WT: 5′-CTTTGGAAAATTCCTTA-3′; Gro β/γ: 5′-CCCGGGAATTTCCCTGGCA-3′; IL-7R WT: 5′-CGCAGGGAATATCCAGGAA-3′ (NF-κB core sequence underlined). Plasmids—The human Naf-1 promoter, spanning –626/+111 nucleotides relative to the cap site, was cloned by PCR using the sense primer, 5′-TTTAAAGGATCCAATGCTTA CGTGCCTTTTGG-3′, and the downstream primer, 5′-ATTTAAAAAGCTTGGGAGCTTGGGGACACAG-3′ using HeLa genomic DNA as a template (Bam H1 and Hind III sites are underlined). The PCR fragment was restricted with Bam H1/Hind III, gel purified, and ligated into the pOLUC firefly luciferase reporter (24Brasier A.R. Jamaluddin M. Casola A. Duan W. Shen Q. Garofalo R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3551-3561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Site mutation of the Rel A binding site was introduced by PCR gene amplification by overlap extension using the sense mutagenic primer, 5′-AGTCTCCCTCCGTTTACTTGAAAAGGGGTGGGGCGGCC-3′ and the antisense mutagenic primer, 5′-CCACCCC TTTTCAAGTAAACGGAGACTGGCAGGCCAC-3′, and the wild type Naf-1/LUC as template (mutated sites are underlined). The luciferase reporter genes driven by the three copies of the rat acute phase response element, (APRE)3-p59rAT/LUC, has been described (24Brasier A.R. Jamaluddin M. Casola A. Duan W. Shen Q. Garofalo R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3551-3561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Plasmids were purified by ion exchange chromatography (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA) and inserts sequenced to verify authenticity prior to transfection. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assays—The ChIP assay was as described with modifications (29Saccani S. Pantano S. Natoli G. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 1351-1359Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). On the day prior to the experiment, 2–4 × 106 cells were plated in 0.5% bovine serum albumin containing growth medium. Cells were stimulated for the indicated times and sequentially cross-linked with disuccinimidyl glutarate and 1% formaldehyde in serum-free medium for 15 min at 37 °C. The cells were washed, transferred to Eppendorf tubes, and solubilized in 400 μl of SDS lysis buffer (1% SDS, 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA) with protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). The samples were sonicated three times, 15 s at setting 2 until DNA fragments were 300–400 bp or less. Equal amounts of DNA were immunoprecipitated overnight at 4 °C in ChIP dilution buffer (50 mm NaCl, 1 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1% IGEPAL-630, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol) with 20 μg of either anti-Rel A (sc-372; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or IgG as indicated. Immunoprecipitates were collected with protein-A magnetic beads (Dynal, Inc.) and washed sequentially with ChIP dilution buffer, high salt buffer, LiCl buffer, and TE buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA). DNA was eluted in 1 ml of elution buffer 1% SDS in 0.1 m NaHCO3. Samples were de-cross-linked in 200 mm NaCl at 65 °C, 1 h. DNA was phenol extracted, ethanol precipitated, and used for PCR. PCR primers and conditions for semiquantitative PCR are shown in Table I. PCR products were fractionated by agarose gel chromatography and stained with ethidium bromide.Table IPrimers and conditions used in ChIP assayGeneRefGenePrimersAnnealExtensionSizeSenseAntisenseTempTimeTempTimeIκBαNM_020529GACGACCCCAATTCAAATCGTCAGGCTCGGGGAATTTCC60306875300GroβNM_002089.1ATCTGACCCACGACGCACTGGGAGGAGAGCTGGCAAGGAG64306875372GroγNM_002090.CCCAGCTCTTTCCTCCAACCTCGGCGAACCCTTTTTATGC64306875342Naf-1BC012133GGTGTTTACCTCGCTCGGTCGGGAGCTTGGGGACACAG64306875280IkBeNM_004556.1TTCCTTGACTGCTGGGGTTGCTTTGGGGGAGGGCATGTAG66306875362 Open table in a new tab Dox-regulated Inhibition of NF-κB Signaling—Because NF-κB is required for normal cell growth and survival (10Liu Z-G.

Nature. 1995; 376: 167-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (1638) Google Scholar), we developed a tetracycline (Tet)-regulated cell system (Tet-Off) (31Gossen M. Bujard H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5547-5551Crossref PubMed Scopus (4256) Google Scholar) by which an NF-κB inhibitor could be tightly controlled and transiently induced. For this purpose, an expression plasmid encoding the non-degradable epitope-tagged IκBα (IκBα Ser32Ala/Ser36Ala, termed FLAG·IκBα Mut) downstream of the Tet operator was stably introduced into cells expressing the Tet transactivator (tTA). FLAG·IκBα Mut contains site mutations in the serine phosphoacceptor sites of IKKβ that block its inducible degradation from a variety of stimuli and function as a potent dominant negative inhibitor of NF-κB activation (23Tian B. Zhang Y. Luxon B.A. Garofalo R.P. Casola A. Sinha M. Brasier A.R. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 6800-6814Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 32Thomas L.H. Friedland J.S. Sharland M. Becker S. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 1007-1016PubMed Google Scholar). The HeLatTA/FLAG·IκBα Mut transfectants cultured in the continuous presence of Dox did not express detectable amounts of FLAG·IκBα Mut by Western immunoblot. In contrast, upon Dox withdrawal, FLAG·IκBα Mut was strongly expressed (Fig. 1A). In earlier analysis of FLAG·IκBα Mut expression, we demonstrated that FLAG·IκBα Mut was expressed at similar levels to the endogenous IκBα (23Tian B. Zhang Y. Luxon B.A. Garofalo R.P. Casola A. Sinha M. Brasier A.R. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 6800-6814Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Importantly, in the short durations used for expression and stimulation, these cells did not have detectable differences in spontaneous or viral-induced apoptosis (23Tian B. Zhang Y. Luxon B.A. Garofalo R.P. Casola A. Sinha M. Brasier A.R. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 6800-6814Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). To demonstrate that these levels of FLAG·IκBα Mut expression could inhibit NF-κB activation, we performed EMSA on nuclear extracts of rhTNFα-stimulated cells. In HeLatTA/FLAG·IκBα Mut cells cultured in the presence of Dox, binding of the Rel A·p50 heterodimer was rapidly induced within 15 min of rhTNFα treatment (Fig. 1B). By contrast, in cells cultured in the absence of Dox, no rhTNFα detectable changes in NF-κB binding were observed in EMSA (Fig. 1B, right panel). We next determined whether the magnitude of FLAG·IκBα Mut expression was sufficient to interfere with NF-κB-dependent transcription. A previously characterized high affinity Rel A/NF-κB1 binding site from the angiotensinogen gene (33Jamaluddin M. Casola A. Garofalo R.P. Han Y. Elliott T. Ogra P.L. Brasier A.R. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 4849-4857Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) cloned as a multimeric element upstream of an inert promoter driving firefly luciferase reporter ((APREWT)3-p59rAT/LUC) was transfected into HeLatTA/FLAG·IκBα Mut cells maintained in the absence or presence of Dox and stimulated in the absence or presence of rhTNFα. As seen in Fig. 1C, in the presence of Dox rhTNFα induced a 22-fold increase in normalized luciferase reporter activity (p <0.0001, n = 3 independent experiments). However, in the absence of Dox, no statistically significant induction could be recorded (a 1.1-fold increase, p = not significant). Together, these data confirmed that the Dox-regulated FLAG·IκBα Mut expression was sufficient to block TNF-inducible NF-κB-dependent transcription. Oligonucleotide Microarray Identification of TNF-regulated NF-κB-dependent Genes—To comprehensively identify the spectrum of genes activated by TNF and those controlled by NF-κB, the tetracycline-regulated FLAG·IκBα Mut-expressing cells were plated in parallel cultures in the absence or presence of Dox (2 μg/ml). Each group of cells was then stimulated for 0, 1, 3, or 6 h with rhTNFα, and RNA was harvested from all plates simultaneously (Fig. 2A). The experiment was replicated in four independent experiments to obtain sufficient replicates for statistical analysis. The RNA was then quantitated and subjected to high density oligonucleotide microarray analysis using the Affymetrix platform (Hu95Av2 GeneChips). To identify the genes regulated by TNF and those regulated by NF-κB, the scaled signal intensity was subjected to two-way analysis of variance with replications considering rhTNFα stimulation and NF-κB inhibition as independent experimental manipulations and filtered by -fold change criteria (Fig. 2B). Genes whose expression was under tonic NF-κB control were first identified by those whose p value was <0.01 as a result of Dox treatment and whose steady state mRNA abundance was ± 3-fold changed in the absence of TNF stimulation (0 h + Dox versus 0 h – Dox) and are shown in Table II. Of the four genes identified, only two (prostaglandin synthase and Rel B) were also TNF regulated. Of these, Rel B ha"

Deregulation of E2F activities in vivo leads to developmental defects and cancer. Based on current evidence in the field, mammalian E2Fs can be functionally categorized into either transcriptional activators (E2F1, E2F2, and E2F3a) or repressors (E2F3b, E2F4, E2F5, E2F6, and E2F7). We have identified a novel E2F family member, E2F8, which is conserved in mice and humans and has its counterpart in Arabidopsis thaliana (E2Ls). Interestingly, E2F7 and E2F8 share unique structural features that distinguish them from other mammalian E2F repressor members, including the presence of two distinct DNA-binding domains and the absence of DP-dimerization, retinoblastoma-binding, and transcriptional activation domains. Similar to E2F7, overexpression of E2F8 significantly slows down the proliferation of primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts. These observations, together with the fact that E2F7 and E2F8 can homodimerize and are expressed in the same adult tissues, suggest that they may have overlapping and perhaps synergistic roles in the control of cellular proliferation.

Although E2Fs can act as transcriptional activators, they can also repress gene expression when bound to the retinoblastoma (Rb) 1The abbreviations used are: Rb, retinoblastoma; DBD, DNA-binding domain; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; MEFs, mouse embryonic fibroblasts; LP, long promoter; SP, short promoter; FBS, fetal bovine serum; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; TK, thymidine kinase; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; DAPI, 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; RT, reverse transcription; UTR, untranslated region; ORF, open reading frame; BrdUrd, 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine; HA, hemagglutinin. 1The abbreviations used are: Rb, retinoblastoma; DBD, DNA-binding domain; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; MEFs, mouse embryonic fibroblasts; LP, long promoter; SP, short promoter; FBS, fetal bovine serum; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; TK, thymidine kinase; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; DAPI, 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; RT, reverse transcription; UTR, untranslated region; ORF, open reading frame; BrdUrd, 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine; HA, hemagglutinin. tumor suppressor protein or related pocket proteins (p130 and p107).

During the G1-S transition of the cell cycle, the cyclin-dependent kinases phosphorylate Rb, resulting in the release of E2F from Rb-containing complexes and the expression of E2F-target genes. Many studies indicate E2F as a key mediator of Rb function in cellular proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis (10Dyson N. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2245-2262Crossref PubMed Scopus (1965) Google Scholar, 11Nevins J.R. Cell Growth & Differ. 1998; 9: 585-593PubMed Google Scholar, 12Trimarchi J.M. Lees J.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell.

E2Fs are also regulated at the level of transcription, post-translational modifications, subcellular localization, association of cofactors, and degradation (11Nevins J.R. Cell Growth & Differ. 1998; 9: 585-593PubMed Google Scholar, 12Trimarchi J.M. Lees J.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 11-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (959) Google Scholar). Because the identification of the founder E2F family member, E2F1, six additional family members have been identified. Structurally, E2F1–6 share a highly conserved DNA-binding and dimerization domain. E2F1–6 bind DNA-target sequences as heterodimers with DP1 or DP2. Although heterodimerization is required for high affinity sequence-specific DNA binding, the specificity of the dimer is determined by the E2F component (10Dyson N. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2245-2262Crossref PubMed Scopus (1965) Google Scholar, 12Trimarchi J.M. Lees J.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 11-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (959) Google Scholar). The most recently identified E2F family member, E2F7, is unique in having a duplicated conserved E2F-like DNA-binding domain and in lacking a DP-dimerization domain. E2F1–5 possess conserved transactivation and pocket protein-binding domains at the C terminus that are absent in E2F6 and E2F7 (10Dyson N.

Based on structural and functional considerations, E2Fs have been classified as either “activator” (E2F1, E2F2, and E2F3a) or “repressor” E2Fs (E2F3b, E2F4, E2F5, E2F6, and E2F7). Activator E2Fs are maximally expressed late in G1 and can be found in association with E2F-regulated promoters during the G1-S transition, co-inciding with the activation of many E2F-target genes. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts ablated for all of the three activator E2Fs are severely compromised in E2F-target gene expression as well as the capacity to proliferate, underscoring the importance of the activator subclass in cell cycle progression (28Wu L.

Among the repressor subclass, E2F6 mediates repression via recruitment of the Polycomb group of proteins or complexes containing Mga and Max proteins (20Ogawa H. Ishiguro K. Gaubatz S.

Although the most recently identified E2F7 protein can function as a repressor independent of DP interaction, its exact mechanism of mediating repression is not understood (14de Bruin A. Maiti B.

E2Fs regulate the transcription of a multitude of genes involved in DNA replication, cell cycle regulation, chromatin assembly and condensation, chromosome segregation, DNA repair, and checkpoint control (10Dyson N.

Consistent with its role in various important cellular processes, E2Fs are evolutionarily conserved among plants and animals with the exception of yeast. Drosophila melanogaster has two E2F genes named dE2F1, which acts as an activator E2F, and dE2F2, which represents a repressor E2F. Each of these E2Fs heterodimerize with a single DP protein found in Drosophila called dDP (22Stevaux O. Dimova D. Frolov M.V. Taylor-Harding B. Morris E. Dyson N. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4927-4937Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). E2F-like activities have also been found in Xenopus laevis and Caenorhabditis elegans (23Ceol C.J. Horvitz H.R. Mol.

Of these, AtE2Fa-c are reminiscent of the mammalian activator E2F1–3a subclass and E2Fd-f resemble the recently discovered E2F7 in that they possess a duplicated DNA-binding domain and exhibit repressor function. Besides human and mouse, Arabidopsis is the only other species where E2Fs with duplicated DNA-binding domain have been described (25Mariconti L. Pellegrini B. Cantoni R. Stevens R. Bergounioux C.

Here we report the identification and characterization of yet another mouse E2F family member that we call E2F8, which closely resembles E2F7. E2F8 is expressed in a cell cycle-regulated fashion, has duplicated DNA-binding domains that are essential for binding to consensus E2F-binding DNA elements, represses E2F-target genes, and negatively influences cellular proliferation. Cloning of the E2F8 cDNA—The mouse testis cDNA library (Origene) was screened using the primer pairs 5′-AGTACCCCAACCCTGCTGTGAATA-3′/5′-GGACTTGTCTTTGCGGCTGTTTAC-3′ and 5′-CCGGCACAACCTCACCAAAAC-3′/5′-TCCCCCGCGTAGAGAAGAGG-3′. Each primer pair resulted in a single sharp band in three wells that were positive of 96-wells in the master plate. Subsequently, we screened the subplates to obtain the clone with the full-length E2F8 cDNA. We subcloned a 5×Myc tag in between the BamH1 and EcoR1 sites of the pcDNA3.1/HisB (Invitrogen) vector in-frame with the His6 tag. We next subcloned the 2583-bp open reading frame of E2F8 inframe with the His and Myc tags, thus generating a construct with full-length E2F8 ORF tagged with His6 and 5× Myc tag at the N terminus. Generation of Mouse Embryonic Fibroblasts and in Vitro Cell Culture—Primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were generated using standard techniques as described before (28Wu L. Timmers C. Maiti B. Saavedra H.I. Sang L. Chong G.T. Nuckolls F. Giangrande P. Wright F.A. Field S.J. Greenberg M.E. Orkin S. Nevins J.R. Robinson M.L. Leone G. Nature. 2001; 414: 457-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). All of the cell lines were grown in DMEM with 15% FBS. Cells were starved in DMEM containing 0.2% FBS when they were ∼70% confluent. After starving for 48–60 h, they were stimulated to grow with DMEM containing 15% FBS. Cells were harvested at different time points after serum stimulation for BrdUrd incorporation assay, Northern blot assay, and real-time RT-PCR. BrdUrd Incorporation Assay—BrdUrd was added to the medium, and cells were incubated with BrdUrd for 2 h being harvested and fixed in methanol/acetone 1:1. We stained cells in 35-mm dishes with anti-BrdUrd primary antibody (NA-61 from Oncogene) and anti-mouse rhodamine secondary antibody and counterstained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). At least 400 cells/35-mm plate were counted. Northern Blot Assay—For the cell cycle Northern Blot analysis, total RNA was isolated from MEFs using TRIzol (Invitrogen) and mRNA was subsequently purified using PolyATract mRNA isolation system (Promega). Poly(A) mRNA was separated on a 1% agarose gel containing 6% formaldehyde and transferred onto a GeneScreen membrane (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The mouse tissue Northern blot was purchased from Origene. The 3′ 1850 bp of the E2F8 cDNA including the 3′-untranslated region (UTR) was used as a probe for both Northern blot analyses. The probe was radiolabeled with 50 μCi of [α-32P]dCTP using Prime-It RmT (Stratagene). Hybridization was carried on overnight under high stringency conditions (5× saline/sodium phosphate/EDTA, 50% formamide, 5× Denhardt's solution, 1% SDS at 42 °C) and washed several times (0.2× SSC, 0.2% SDS at 65 °C) before autoradiography. Real-time RT-PCR—Approximately 1 × 106 cells were harvested at the indicated time point, and total RNA was isolated using the Qiagen RNA Miniprep column as described by the manufacturer, including a DNase treatment before elution from the column. Reverse transcription of 2 μg of total RNA was performed by combining 1 μl of Superscript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen), 4 μl of 10× buffer, 0.5 μl of 100 mm oligo(dT) primer, 0.5 μl of 25 mm dNTPs, 1.0 μl of 0.1 m dithiothreitol, 1.0 μl of RNase inhibitor (Roche Applied Science), and water up to a volume of 20 μl. Reactions were incubated at 50 °C for 60 min and then diluted 5-fold with 80 μl of water. Real-time RT-PCR was performed using the Bio-Rad iCycler PCR machine. Each PCR reaction contained 0.5 μl of cDNA template and primers at a concentration of 100 nm in a final volume of 25 μl of SYBR Green reaction mixture (Bio-Rad). Each PCR reaction generated only the expected amplicon as shown by the melting-temperature profiles of the final products and by gel electrophoresis. Standard curves were performed using cDNA to determine the linear range and PCR efficiency of each primer pair. Reactions were done in triplicate, and relative amounts of cDNA were normalized to GAPDH. The sequences of the primer pair used for the E2F8 cDNA were 5′-CCGGCACAACCTCACCAAAAC-3′ and 5′-TCCCCCGCGTAGAGAAGAGG-3′. Primer sequences of the E2F-target genes are available upon request. 5′-RACE PCR—Total RNA was isolated from wild-type primary MEFs and mouse thymus, and the mouse testis cDNA was purchased in the Marathon-Ready cDNA kit (Clontech). cDNA was prepared, and 5′-RACE PCR was performed using the BD SMART RACE cDNA amplification kit (BD Biosciences) following the manufacturer's protocol. The reverse primer used for 5′-RACE PCR were 5′-TCACGCGTAAGGACTTGTCTTTGC-3′ mapping to the exon 6 of E2F8 gene, and the nested primer was 5′-CGTCCCGAGGGTTTTGGTGAGGTT-3′ located in the exon 5 of the E2F8 gene. The products of 5′-RACE PCR were cloned using the TOPO TA cloning kit for sequencing (Invitrogen). At least 20 colonies from each tissue type were sequenced. Luciferase Reporter Assay—A 3.5-kb promoter fragment was isolated from the BAC clone RPCI 24-294G9 and subcloned into pBluescript vector. The primer pair used for amplifying the long promoter (LP) fragment was 5′-GAGAGAGGTACCGTCCTCCAACCCCTCGTTTG-3′ and 5′-AGAGAGAAGCTTGCTGAAGTTTCTCGCCTGACAC-3′ and that for amplifying the short promoter (SP) fragment was 5′-GAGAGAGGTACCAGCTCTGAAGGAGGATTGACAGG-3′ and 5′-AGAGAGAAGCTTGCTGAAGTTTCTCGCCTGACAC-3′. The amplified fragments were subcloned into the pGL2Basic vector using the HindIII and KpnI restriction sites. The two E2F-binding consensus sites in the E2F8 promoter fragment were mutated using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit as described by the manufacturer. The mutations introduced are depicted in Fig. 4A. All of the constructs were confirmed by sequencing. Subconfluent REF52 cells grown in triplicates were transfected using the Superfect reagent (Qiagen). The cells were transfected with the firefly luciferase expression vectors and thymidine kinase (TK) Renilla luciferase as internal control. The cells then were serum-starved in DMEM containing 0.2% FBS for 48 h and stimulated to enter the cell cycle by DMEM containing 15% FBS. Cells were harvested at the indicated time points, and luciferase was detected by the Dual-Luciferase reporter assay system (Promega). Western Blot Analysis—Cell protein lysates were separated in SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes. Blots were first incubated in blocking buffer (10% skim milk in Tris-buffered saline plus Tween 20) for 1 h and subsequently incubated overnight in blocking buffer containing the antibody specific for Myc tag 9E10 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, SC-40). The primary antibody was then detected using horseradish-peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and ECL reagent as described by the manufacturer (Amersham Biosciences). Immunofluorescence—MEFs were grown in 35-mm dishes and transfected with His-Myc-tagged E2F8 or control vector. The cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and methanol/acetone (1:1). The Myc antibody 9E10 was the primary antibody used, and rhodamine-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Vector Laboratories) was used as the secondary. The cells were counterstained with DAPI. The procedure for the staining was same as described before (14de Bruin A. Maiti B. Jakoi L. Timmers C. Buerki R. Leone G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 42041-42049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Electromobility Shift Assay for DNA Binding—The probe used for the DNA binding assay was a fragment of the adenoviral E2 promoter containing two E2F-binding sites. The complimentary strands of the probes were biotinylated on the 5′ end and were annealed together to make a double-stranded probe end-labeled with biotin. The sequence of the wild-type probe was 5′-TCGAGACGTAGTTTTCGCGCTTAAATTTGAGAAAGGGCGCGAAACTAGTCCTTAACTCGA-3′, and that of the mutated probe was 5′-TCGAGACGTAGTTTTAAGGCTTAAATTTGAGAAAGGGCTTGAAACTAGTCCTTAACTCGA-3′. The binding reaction was carried out in a 20-μl volume using 40 fmol of biotinylated probe and 8 pmol of non-biotinylated wild-type or mutated probe as and when required. The binding conditions were the same as described before (16Logan N. Delavaine L. Graham A. Reilly C. Wilson J. Brummelkamp T.R. Hijmans E.M. Bernards R. La Thangue N.B. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 5138-5150Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The Supershift analysis was carried out as previously described using an antibody specific against Myc (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, SC-40). Proteins were translated using the TnT Quick Coupled transcription/translation system (Promega). After carrying out the binding reaction at 30 °C for 30 min, Ficoll was added to it to a final concentration of 4% and it was separated on a 4% polyacrylamide gel. After running the gel, it was transferred to Hybond N+ membrane (Amersham Biosciences) and UV-cross-linked. It then was probed using the LightShift™ chemiluminescent EMSA kit (Pierce) following the manufacturer's protocol. The chemiluminescence was detected on Hyperfilm (Amersham Biosciences). Site-directed Mutagenesis of the DNA-binding Domains—Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit following the manufacturer's protocol. We used the following primers for DBD1, 5′-CGGAAGGAGAAGAGCGAATTCTTGCTATGCCACAAA-3′ and 5′-TTTGTGGCATAGCAAGAATTCGCTCTTCTCCTTCCG-3′, and the following primers for DBD2, 5′-CGCAAAGACAAGTCCGAATTCGTGATGAGCCAGAAG-3′ and 5′-CTTCTGGCTCATCACGAATTCGGACTTGTCTTTGCG-3′. Structural Analysis—Sequence alignments of the E2F8 DNA-binding domains by the ClustalW method were used to generate models for E2F8 DNA binding (19Schwede T. Kopp J. Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3381-3385Crossref PubMed Scopus (4448) Google Scholar). Modeling requests were submitted to the SWISS-MODEL protein modeling server using the previously solved E2F4/DP2 crystal structure Protein Data Bank file (1CF7) as the template. Co-immunoprecipitation—Transiently transfected 293 cells were harvested in cold phosphate-buffered saline, and cell pellets were lysed in 10× volume of lysis buffer (0.05 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.3, 0.3 m NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol with protease inhibitor mixture). Lysates were incubated with Protein G Plus/protein A-agarose beads (Calbiochem) at 4 °C for 1 h to preclear. The precleared lysates were incubated with appropriate antibody overnight. Protein G Plus/protein A-agarose beads were added and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. Protein binding to the beads were released and resolved by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting were performed using M2 monoclonal anti-FLAG (Sigma), anti-HA (Roche Applied Science), anti-Myc 9E10 antibodies. Retroviral Infection—Full-length cDNAs for His-Myc-tagged E2F8 was subcloned into the pBABE retroviral vector containing a hygromycin-resistance gene. High-titer retroviruses were produced by transient transfection of retroviral constructs into the Phoenix-Eco packaging cell line as described previously (33Pear W.S. Nolan G.P. Scott M.L. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8392-8396Crossref PubMed Scopus (2292) Google Scholar). MEFs were infected with the retrovirus using standard methods and were selected in the presence of 200 μg ml-1 hygromycin. Proliferation Assay—MEFs were plated at 4 × 104 cells/60-mm plate and grown in DMEM with 15% FBS. Duplicate plates were counted daily using a BD Biosciences Coulter counter and were replated every 72 h at the same density of the initial plating. Identification and Cloning of Mouse E2F8 —We performed a homology search across the sequenced mouse genome (Celera and GenBank™ databases) using the E2F3 DBD amino acid sequence as the reference. The search retrieved the known E2Fs (E2F1–7) and a potentially novel E2F gene, which we named E2F8. The in silico predicted E2F8 protein (Celera and GenBank™ databases) possesses two E2F-like DBDs but shares no homology to any other known domains conserved across the E2F family members. We also performed a BLASTN (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/) search using the predicted E2F8 transcript as a query. The search recovered several mouse expressed sequence tags from a variety of mouse tissues and developmental stages (UniGene Cluster Mm.240566). Using E2F8-specific primers, we screened the mouse testis cDNA library (Origene Technologies Inc.) and retrieved the full-length mouse E2F8 cDNA clone. Analysis using the University of California Southern California Genome Browser-BLAT tool (29Kent W.J. Genome Res. 2002; 12: 656-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (6117) Google Scholar) revealed that the mouse E2F8 gene is located on chromosome 7 and contains 13 exons separated by 12 introns (Fig. 1A). We sequenced a BAC clone containing the E2F8 gene to determine the sequences across the splice junctions. From 5′ to 3′ end of the gene, the 12 splice sites have the universal consensus splice junction dinucleotides GT/AG. The first initiation ATG, as predicted by the presence of a Kozak consensus sequence and an in-frame termination codon, is in exon 2, and the stop codon TGA are in exon 13, giving rise to a 2583-bp open reading frame encoding 860 amino acids (Fig. 1B). E2F8 mRNA has a 300-bp long 5′-UTR and a 587-bp long 3′-UTR. There are two consensus polyadenylation signals, AATAAA and ATTAAA, that are 327 and 238 bp upstream of the poly(A) tail, respectively. The polyadenylation signal that is relevant in this particular clone is the non-canonical polyadenylation signal TATAAA located 18 bases upstream of the poly(A) tail (30Beaudoing E. Freier S. Wyatt J.R. Claverie J-M. Gautheret D. Genome Res. 2000; 10: 1001-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). E2F8 Protein Characteristics and Homology with the Other E2Fs—The E2F8 protein consists of 860 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of ∼95 kDa. It has two E2F-like DBDs and three putative nuclear localization signals (Fig. 1, C and D). The presence of two E2F-like DBDs is reminiscent of the mammalian E2F7 and Arabidopsis E2Fd-f. The alignment of the DBDs of mouse E2F1–8 and Arabidopsis E2Fd using the ClustalW program shows high homology with notable conservation of the RRXYDI DNA recognition motif (Fig. 2A). Despite significant homology in the duplicated DBD, E2F8 is devoid of any other E2F-like domains including the pocket protein-binding, transactivation, and DP dimerization domains, a characteristic shared by mammalian E2F7 and Arabidopsis E2Fd-f proteins (Fig. 2C). Phylogenetically, the DBDs of Arabidopsis E2Fd-f and mouse E2F7 and E2F8 cluster together (Fig. 2B). Significantly, when the full-length mouse E2F proteins were analyzed for evolutionary relationship on the basis of their primary structure, we also obtained a segregation pattern that is reflective of their known functional characteristics. The acquisition of additional E2Fs may stem from a developmental requirement for E2F activity in multiple different tissues as organisms evolve to be structurally and functionally more complex down the path of evolution (Fig. 2D). E2F8 Expression Pattern in Tissues and over the Cell Cycle—As a first step toward the understanding of E2F8 function, we investigated its tissue and cell cycle expression patterns. A 3′ ∼2500-bp fragment of E2F8 cDNA, which lacked any significant sequence overlap with any of the other known E2Fs, was used to probe tissue-specific Northern blots. We found that E2F8 is highly expressed in the liver, skin, thymus, and testis but not in the brain, muscle, and stomach (Fig. 3A). Interestingly, this pattern of expression is almost identical to that previously found for E2F7, giving rise to the possibility that E2F7 and E2F8 may have overlapping or complementary functions in these organs. As discussed above, the known E2F family members fall into two distinct categories with regard to their patterns of expression during the cell cycle. Consistent with their function, the expression of the activator subclass (E2F1, E2F2, and E2F3a) is maximal as cells enter the cell cycle, whereas the expression of the repressor subclass (E2F3b, E2F4, and E2F5) remains unchanged throughout all of the cell cycle. To determine whether the expression of E2F8 is cell cycle-dependent, E2F8 mRNA levels were measured by Northern blot and real-time RT-PCR analysis in synchronized and cycling populations of primary MEFs. MEFs were synchronized in quiescence (G0) by starvation in medium containing 0.2% FBS for 48 h and then stimulated by the addition of medium containing 15% FBS. RNA was isolated from cells harvested at different time points following serum stimulation. Poly(A) mRNA was"

Although the contribution of MAPKs to cell growth and cell death has been examined extensively, it remains unclear whether MKPs play an essential role in the regulation of these processes. To clarify the role of MKP-1, we determined the effects on the MAPKs and cell growth and death in primary fibroblasts derived from mice lacking MKP-1. Here we have shown that MKP-1 is critical for the inactivation of p38 MAPK and JNK following stimulation with serum, anisomycin, and osmotic stress. In addition, MKP-1 was identified as a critical negative regulator of the cAMP-mediated p38 MAPK pathway. MKP-1-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) displayed enhanced p38 MAPK activity and cAMP-response element-dependent transcriptional activation in response to forskolin. Surprisingly, MKP-1-deficient fibroblasts exhibited reduced cell growth compared with wild type MEFs as a result of enhanced cell death. The enhanced level of cell death in MKP-1-deficient MEFs was rescued by SB203580, an inhibitor of p38 MAPK. MKP-1-deficient MEFs were also sensitive to anisomycin-induced apoptosis. Collectively, these data demonstrate that MKP-1 promotes cell survival by attenuating stress-responsive MAPK-mediated apoptosis.

Specifically, p38 MAPK and c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) have been implicated in stress-responsive signaling leading to the initiation of adaptive events such as gene expression, differentiation, metabolism, and apoptosis (1Davis R.J.

In contrast, little is known about the requirement for the family of enzymes known as MAPK phosphatases (MKPs) that inactivate MAPKs in these cellular processes. Because both the magnitude and duration of MAPK activity dictates the outcome of numerous physiological responses, it is essential to understand the contribution of MKPs in MAPK regulation. There are 11 members of the MKP family that inactivate MAPKs via dephosphorylation of the MAPK regulatory serine/threonine and tyrosine residues. These MKPs have unique and overlapping substrate specificity toward MAPKs (7Farooq A. Zhou M.M. Cell. Signal. 2004; 16: 769-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar, 8Camps M. Nichols A.

MKP-1 (hVH-1, Erp, 3CH134, CL100) is the archetypal MKP, composed of two cdc25 homology domains, designated CH2A and CH2B, within the NH2 terminus and a catalytic PTP domain on the COOH terminus (7Farooq A. Zhou M.M. Cell. Signal. 2004; 16: 769-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar, 8Camps M. Nichols A. Arkinstall S.

MKP-1 was originally identified as 3CH134 from a screen for genes expressed during G0/G1 (12Lau L.F. Nathans D. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 3145-3151Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). It was later cloned from a murine NIH3T3 cDNA library as an immediate early gene that is inducible by growth factors (13Charles C.H. Abler A.S. Lau L.F. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 187-190PubMed Google Scholar). A human clone (CL100) was later shown to be inducible in response to stress (14Keyse S.M. Emslie E.A. Nature. 1992; 359: 644-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). Inducible expression of MKP-1 was used to demonstrate that MKP-1 preferentially inactivates p38 MAPK, then JNK, and to a lesser extent the growth factor-responsive MAPK extracellular-regulated kinases 1/2 (Erk) (15Franklin C.C. Srikanth S. Kraft A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3014-3019Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 16Franklin C.C. Kraft A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16917-16923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). A plethora of reports have implicated MKP-1 in the regulation of a variety of physiological processes such as gene expression, cell growth, apoptosis, and immune responsiveness (8Camps M. Nichols A. Arkinstall S. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 6-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar, 9Keyse S.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 186-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar, 11Theodosiou A. Ashworth A. Genome Biol. 2002; 3: 3009.1-3009.10Crossref Google Scholar). Although many of these studies demonstrate a role for MKP-1 in these biological pathways, a complete appreciation of whether MKP-1 is an essential physiological regulator has remained unclear. Indeed, it has been reported that MKP-1 plays a redundant role in MAPK-mediated signaling because fibroblasts derived from mice lacking MKP-1 were reported to have unaltered Erk activation, cell growth, and c-fos expression in response to serum (17Dorfman K. Carrasco D. Gruda M. Ryan C. Lira S.A. Bravo R. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 925-931PubMed Google Scholar). These observations have led to the perception that the function of MKP-1 can be subserved by other MKPs and/or other phosphatases. In this report, we have attempted to clarify the role of MKP-1 in cell growth and cell death. We show here that primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) derived from mice lacking MKP-1 exhibit hyperactivation of p38 MAPK and JNK in response to serum, osmotic stress, and anisomycin. MKP-1-deficient MEFs exhibited reduced cell growth as a result of enhanced sensitivity to cell death and stress-induced apoptosis. These data demonstrate that MKP-1 plays a critical role in the negative regulation of p38 MAPK and JNK in response to stress to promote cell survival. Mice and Genotype Analysis—MKP-1-/- mice were re-derived by implantation into surrogate mothers of heterozygote (MKP+/-) embryos obtained from Bristol-Myers Squibb. Mice were maintained on rodent chow 2018 (Harlan Tek lad). For genotype analysis, tissues were digested with Gitschier buffer (67 mm Tris-HCL, pH 8.8, 16.6 mm ammonium sulfate, 6.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1% β-mercaptoethanol, 100 μg/ml proteinase K) overnight at 55 °C. Samples were incubated at 95 °C for 5 min, vortexed for 2 min, and centrifuged at 20,800 × g for 2 min. PCR analysis was performed using a triple primer set consisting of 5′-CCA GGT ACTG TGT CGG TGG TGC-3′ and 5′-CAG CGC ATC GCC TTC TAT CGC C-3′ and 5′-GTC TAG GAG GAT TGT GCC AGG-3′. Isolation of Primary Mouse Embryonic Fibroblasts—Primary MEFs were derived from E12-E14 embryos. Embryos were minced and incubated with trypsin/EDTA at 37 °C for 30 min. Isolated cells were cultured at 37 °C, 5% CO2 in MEF growth medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FBS and 50 units/ml penicillin and 50 μg/ml streptomycin). All experiments were performed within three passages. [35S]Methionine Metabolic Labeling—Primary MKP-1+/+ and MKP-1-/- MEFs were cultured in MEF deprivation medium for 48 h prior to starvation with methionine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 1 h. The cells were treated with 100 μCi/ml [35S]methionine Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium or 100 μCi/ml [35S]methionine Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 100 ng/ml epidermal growth factor for 1 h. Cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, lysed with 1 ml of Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (1.0% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm benzamidine) for 30 min prior to clarification by centrifugation at 41,400 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The lysates were incubated with 10 μl of anti-MKP-1 Ab332 (18Bennett A.M. Tonks N.K. Science. 1997; 278: 1288-1291Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar) antibody overnight and captured with Protein-A-Sepharose beads. The immune complexes were washed three times with Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer and once with ice-cold STE buffer (150 mm NaCl, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 1 mm EDTA), resolved by SDS-PAGE, and dried for autoradiography. Analysis of MAP Kinase Activities—Primary MEFs that were serum-deprived for 48 h were left untreated or stimulated with 10% FBS for 30, 60, or 120 min. Primary MEFs were left untreated or stimulated with 5 μm anisomycin for 0.5, 1, 2, or 4 h. To induce osmotic stress, primary MEFs were cultured for 30 min in growth medium containing 600 mm sorbitol, washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, and cultured in MEF growth medium for another 0 or 60 min. Primary MEFs were serum deprived for 24 h prior to stimulation with 10 μm Forskolin (FSK) (Sigma). Cells were lysed for 30 min in RIPA buffer (25 mm Tris-HCL, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.l% SDS, 1% sodium deoxycholic acid) supplemented with 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm benzamidine, 2 mm Na3VO4, and 50 mm NaF prior to clarification at 20,800 × g for 15 min. Protein concentration was determined by Coomassie protein reagent (Pierce). Approximately 100 μg of cell lysates were resolved on SDS-PAGE, and proteins were transferred to Immobilon-P membranes and immunoblotted with antiphospho-Erk1 (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA), anti-phospho-p38 MAPK (New England Biolabs), anti-phospho-JNK1 (New England Biolabs), anti-phospho-cAMP-responsive element-binding (CREB) protein (New England Biolabs), or anti-CREB (New England Biolabs) antibodies. The immunoblots were stripped with stripping buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS) for 20 min at 55 °C and reprobed with anti-Erk1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), anti-p38 MAPK (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or anti-JNK1 antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). p38 MAPK was immunoprecipitated with anti-p38 MAPK (Santa Cruz) antibody and collected on Protein-G-Sepharose beads. JNK activity was assessed by incubating protein lysates with glutathione S-transferase (GST)-c-Jun (amino acids 5–89) for 1 h at 4 °C. The complexes were washed three times with lysis buffer and once with kinase buffer (25 mm HEPES, 25 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 2 mm dithiothreitol). The in vitro kinase reactions were initiated with the addition of 50 μm ATP and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and incubated for 30 min at 30 °C, using GST-ATF2 or GST-c-Jun as substrates for p38MAPK and JNK, respectively. Reactions were terminated by the addition of sample buffer, and substrates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and dried for autoradiography. Luciferase Reporter Assays—Primary MKP-1+/+ and MKP-1-/- MEFs were transiently transfected with 1 μg of CRE-Luc and 50 ng of Renilla using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cells were cultured in starvation medium for ∼24 h prior to stimulation with 10 μm FSK for ∼6 h. Luciferase and Renilla activities were measured with the luciferase assay system kit (Promega, Madison, WI). Cell Proliferation and Apoptosis Assays—Primary MKP-1+/+, MKP-1+/-, and MKP-1-/- MEFs were cultured in serum deprivation medium for 48 h. Cell proliferation was initiated by the addition of MEF growth medium (10% FBS). Cell number was determined on days 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4. To assess cell death, 3,500 primary MEFs were cultured on 60-mm2 dishes. Serum-deprived cells were preincubated with Me2SO, 10 μm SB203580 (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA) or 10 μm SP600125 (Calbiochem) for 30 min prior to the addition of growth medium to initiate cell proliferation. Adherent and non-adherent cells were collected on days 0 and 4, and cell death was determined by counting the number of trypan blue-positive and excluded cells. The percentage cell death was quantified by normalizing the number of trypan blue-positive cells to the total number of cells (trypan blue-positive and excluded cells). For the apoptosis assay, primary MKP-1+/+ and MKP-1-/- MEFs were either left untreated or treated with 2.5 μm anisomycin for 12 h. Adherent and non-adherent cells were collected, and cell death was determined by trypan blue exclusion. Caspase-3 activity was measured according to the manufacturer's instructions (ApoAlert caspase-3 fluorescent assay kit Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) and normalized to protein concentration. MKP-1 Is a Critical Regulator of p38 MAPK and JNK in Primary MEFs—Primary MEFs were derived from wild type (MKP-1+/+) embryos and embryos in which MKP-1 expression was disrupted through insertion of a neomycin cassette into exon 2 of the MKP-1 gene (17Dorfman K. Carrasco D. Gruda M. Ryan C. Lira S.A. Bravo R. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 925-931PubMed Google Scholar). Genotyping of wild type (MKP-1+/+), heterozygotic (MKP-1+/-), and homozygotic (MKP-1-/-) mice confirmed the presence of the neomycin cassette in either one or both alleles of MKP-1+/- and MKP-1-/- mice, respectively (Fig. 1A). MKP-1+/+, MKP-1+/-, and MKP-1-/- MEFs were stimulated with epidermal growth factor, and MKP-1 was immunoprecipitated. MKP-1 was found to be inducibly expressed in MKP-1+/+ and MKP-1+/-, but not in MKP-1-/-, MEFs (Fig. 1B). These data demonstrate the successful isolation of primary MEFs deficient in the expression of MKP-1. We first assessed the kinetics of Erk, p38 MAPK, and JNK activities in primary MKP-1+/+ and MKP-1-/- MEFs following serum stimulation (Fig. 2). Consistent with previously published results (17Dorfman K. Carrasco D. Gruda M. Ryan C. Lira S.A. Bravo R. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 925-931PubMed Google Scholar), Erk was activated in MKP-1-/- MEFs to levels equivalent to that of MKP-1+/+ MEFs following serum stimulation (Fig. 2). In contrast, p38 MAPK was hyperactivated at 30 and 60 min following serum stimulation in MKP-1-/- MEFs as compared with MKP-1+/+ MEFs (Fig. 2). JNK was also hyperactivated in MKP-1-/- MEFs 60 min following serum stimulation (Fig. 2). These results demonstrate that MKP-1 is a critical negative regulator of p38 MAPK and JNK, but not Erk, activation in fibroblasts stimulated with serum. To further establish MKP-1 as an essential negative regulator of the stress-responsive MAPKs, we determined whether MKP-1 is important for the inactivation of p38 MAPK and JNK in distinct stress-responsive paradigms. Anisomycin is a potent inducer of p38 MAPK and JNK (19Tournier C. Hess P. Yang D.D. Xu J. Turner T.K. Nimnual A. Bar-Sagi D. Jones S.N. Flavell R.A. Davis R.J. Science. 2000; 288: 870-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (1538) Google Scholar). Following anisomycin stimulation, activation of p38 MAPK and JNK was enhanced in MKP-1-/- MEFs as compared with MKP-1+/+ MEFs (Fig. 3, A and B). We next examined the role of MKP-1 in regulating p38 MAPK and JNK in response to osmotic stress. Following osmotic stress, both p38 MAPK and JNK are stimulated (1Davis R.J. Cell. 2000; 103: 239-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3612) Google Scholar, 3Ono K. Han J. Cell. Signal. 2000; 12: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (1385) Google Scholar), and MKP-1 gene expression is induced by osmotic stress (20Lornejad-Schafer M.R. Schafer C. Graf D. Haussinger D. Schliess F. Biochem. J. 2003; 371: 609-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 21Schliess F. Heinrich S. Haussinger D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 351: 35-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Primary MKP-1+/+ and MKP-1-/- MEFs were treated with 600 mm sorbitol for 30 min, and p38 MAPK and JNK immune complex kinase activities were performed (Fig. 3C). Both p38 MAPK and JNK were hyperactivated in MKP-1-/- MEFs following osmotic stress as compared with MKP-1+/+ MEFs (Fig. 3C). To assess the requirement for MKP-1 to attenuate MAPK activity in cells recovering from osmotic stress, sorbitol was removed after 30 min of sorbitol stimulation; MEFs were recultured in medium lacking sorbitol for an additional 60 min. Osmotic stress-induced p38 MAPK and JNK activities were attenuated in both MKP-1+/+ and MKP-1-/- MEFs upon removal of sorbitol (Fig. 3C). These data suggest that other phosphatases and/or MKPs also participate in the inactivation of both p38 MAPK and JNK following osmotic stress. These data also clearly demonstrate that MKP-1 is a critical inactivator of p38 MAPK and JNK activities in response to anisomycin and osmotic stress. Hyperactivation of FSK-induced p38 MAPK and CREB Activation in MKP-1-deficient MEFs—The CREB protein is a transcription factor that becomes activated upon phosphorylation by either cAMP-dependent protein kinase A, or p38 MAPK in response to elevated levels of cAMP (22Mayr B. Montminy M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 599-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (2051) Google Scholar, 23Pugazhenthi S. Boras T. O'Connor D. Meintzer M.K. Heidenreich K.A. Reusch J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2829-2837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). To examine whether MKP-1 plays an essential role in downstream transcriptional regulation, we examined CREB phosphorylation following FSK stimulation of MKP-1+/+ and MKP-1-/- MEFs. Erk and JNK were not activated following FSK stimulation of primary MEFs (data not shown). However, p38 MAPK was weakly activated in MKP-1+/+ MEFs; in contrast, p38 MAPK was robustly hyperactivated in MKP-1-/- MEFs following FSK stimulation (Fig. 4A). Consistent with the findings that p38 MAPK stimulates CREB serine 133 phosphorylation (22Mayr B. Montminy M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 599-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (2051) Google Scholar), FSK-induced CREB phosphorylation was enhanced in MKP-1-/- MEFs as compared with MKP-1+/+ MEFs (Fig. 4A). Based on these observations, CREB-mediated gene expression would also be expected to be hyperactivated in MKP-1-/- MEFs. To confirm this, we transfected a minimal CRE-responsive element fused to a luciferase reporter gene (CRE-luc) into MKP-1+/+ and MKP-1-/- MEFs. These experiments showed that FSK elicited an ∼18-fold increase in CRE-mediated luciferase activity in MKP-1+/+ MEFs. In contrast, MKP-1-/- MEFs produced an ∼32-fold increase in CRE-mediated luciferase activity (Fig. 4B). These results demonstrate that MKP-1 plays an important role in attenuating cAMP-mediated p38 MAPK activation, CREB phosphorylation (serine 133), and ultimately CREB-mediated gene expression. Enhanced Cell Death in Primary MKP-1-/-MEFs—A number of studies have shown that p38 MAPK and JNK function to either promote or inhibit cell cycle progression (24Wang S. Nath N. Minden A. Chellappan S. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1559-1570Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 25Awad M.M. Enslen H. Boylan J.M. Davis R.J. Gruppuso P.A. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 20608-20616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1078) Google Scholar). It also has been reported that MKP-1 overexpression inhibits cell cycle progression through the inactivation of Erk (27Brondello J.M. McKenzie F.R. Sun H. Tonks N.K. Pouysségur J. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1895-1904PubMed Google Scholar, 28Sun H. Tonks N.K. Bar-Sagi D. Science. 1995; 266: 285-288Crossref Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 29Noguchi T. Metz R. Chen L. Mattei M-G. Carrsaco D. Bravo R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5195-5205Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). To clarify the role of MKP-1 in MAPK-mediated cell proliferation we assessed the growth rates of MKP-1+/+, MKP-1+/-, and MKP-1-/- MEFs. In agreement with previously published results (17Dorfman K. Carrasco D. Gruda M. Ryan C. Lira S.A. Bravo R. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 925-931PubMed Google Scholar), MKP-1+/- and MKP-1-/- MEFs proliferated at similar rates (Fig. 5A). However, the proliferation rates of MKP-1+/- and MKP-1-/- MEFs were significantly less as compared with MKP-1+/+ MEFs (Fig. 5A). These results demonstrate that fibroblasts require MKP-1 for cell growth. It has been well documented that p38 MAPK and JNK are important regulators of apoptosis (1Davis R.J. Cell. 2000; 103: 239-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3612) Google Scholar, 2Chang L. Karin M. Nature. 2001; 410: 37-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (4359) Google Scholar, 3Ono K. Han J. Cell. Signal. 2000; 12: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (1385) Google Scholar). It was conceivable that the decrease in cell proliferation observed in MKP-1-/- MEFs could be due to increased sensitivity to cell death. Hence, we assessed the levels of cell death in MKP-1+/+ and MKP-1-/- MEFs. Following serum deprivation for 48 h (day 0), the level of cell death was ∼1.5-fold higher in MKP-1-/- MEFs as compared with MKP-1+/+ MEFs (Fig. 5B). After MEFs were restimulated with serum for 4 days, the level of cell death was significantly higher in MKP-1-/- MEFs as compared with MKP-1+/+ MEFs (Fig. 5B). MEFs lacking p38 MAPK or JNK have been reported to be more resistant to cell death (19Tournier C. Hess P. Yang D.D. Xu J. Turner T.K. Nimnual A. Bar-Sagi D. Jones S.N. Flavell R.A. Davis R.J. Science. 2000; 288: 870-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (1538) Google Scholar, 30Porras A. Zuluaga S. Black E. Valladares A. Alvarez A.M. Ambrosino C. Benito M. Nebreda A.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 922-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Thus, we hypothesized that inhibiting either p38 MAPK or JNK activity should rescue, at least in part, the cell death defect in MKP-1-/- MEFs. When p38 MAPK activity was inhibited using the p38α/β MAPK-specific inhibitor SB203580, MKP-1-/- MEFs exhibited a reduction in cell death to levels that were comparable with that of MKP-1+/+ MEFs (Fig. 5B). To test the possibility that JNK may also be involved in promoting cell death in MKP-1-/- MEFs, we asked whether the JNK inhibitor SP600125 could also rescue the enhanced level of cell death seen in MKP-1-/- MEFs. Surprisingly, inhibiting JNK activity with SP600125 enhanced the level of cell death even further in MKP-1-/- MEFs as compared with vehicle-treated MKP-1+/+ and MKP-1-/- MEFs (Fig. 5B). We conclude that MKP-1 plays an essential role in suppressing the activity of p38 MAPK in proliferating fibroblasts to promote cell survival. Although MKP-1-/- MEFs exhibited enhanced JNK activity in serum (Fig. 2), JNK inhibition with SP600125 failed to rescue the enhanced cell death, suggesting that JNK is unlikely to be the major target of MKP-1 in the growth factor-mediated survival pathway. MKP-1 Is a Critical Negative Regulator of Caspase-3-mediated Apoptosis—To examine the mechanism for the enhanced sensitivity to cell death in the absence of MKP-1, we tested whether MKP-1 is required for regulating apoptosis in response to stress. Although others have shown that expression of MKP-1 can protect against apoptosis (15Franklin C.C. Srikanth S. Kraft A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3014-3019Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 31Guo Y-L. Kang B. Williamson J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10362-10366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), it remains to be determined whether it plays an essential role in this process. Anisomycin induces apoptosis via activation of both p38 MAPK and JNK (19Tournier C. Hess P. Yang D.D. Xu J. Turner T.K. Nimnual A. Bar-Sagi D. Jones S.N. Flavell R.A. Davis R.J. Science. 2000; 288: 870-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (1538) Google Scholar). Because p38 MAPK and JNK are hyperactivated in primary MKP-1-/- MEFs in response to anisomycin (Fig. 3, A and B), we hypothesized that MKP-1-/- MEFs are likely to be more sensitive to anisomycin-induced apoptosis. Following anisomycin stimulation, cell death was elevated by ∼2-fold in MKP-1+/+ MEFs, but an ∼4-fold increase was observed in MKP-1-/- MEFs (Fig. 5C). Both the p38 MAPK and JNK pathways function as upstream mediators of caspase-3 activation leading to apoptosis via the release of cytochrome c (19Tournier C. Hess P. Yang D.D. Xu J. Turner T.K. Nimnual A. Bar-Sagi D. Jones S.N. Flavell R.A. Davis R.J. Science. 2000; 288: 870-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (1538) Google Scholar, 32Shifrin V.I. Anderson P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13985-13992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). We therefore tested whether MKP-1 is required to regulate apoptosis via caspase-3. MKP-1-/- MEFs exhibited a significantly enhanced level of caspase-3 activation as compared with anisomycin-treated MKP-1+/+ MEFs (Fig. 5D). Thus, enhanced activation of p38 MAPK and/or JNK in the absence of MKP-1 results in sensitization to stress-induced apoptosis. Originally isolated as a stress-responsive protein phosphatase, MKP-1 was initially shown to dephosphorylate Erk (33Sun H. Charles C.H. Lau L.F. Tonks N.K. Cell. 1993; 75: 487-493Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1023) Google Scholar, 34Charles C.H. Sun H. Lau L.F. Tonks N.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5292-5296Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). A combination of in vitro and overexpression studies in cultured cells subsequently demonstrated that MKP-1 dephosphorylated the MAPKs with a rank order of p38 MAPK ≥ JNK > Erk. Although these studies supported the interpretation that MKP-1 has a higher potency of dephosphorylation toward the stress-responsive MAPKs, it remained unclear whether MKP-1 was absolutely required for the physiological inactivation of these MAPKs. The notion that MKP-1 plays a non-redundant role in the inactivation of MAPKs came from studies using mice in which MKP-1 expression was disrupted. It was shown that in response to serum, MEFs derived from MKP-1-deficient mice exhibit equivalent levels of Erk activity and cell proliferation comparable with that of MKP-1+/- MEFs (17Dorfman K. Carrasco D. Gruda M. Ryan C. Lira S.A. Bravo R. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 925-931PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that MKP-1 plays a redundant role in the regulation of Erk activity and cell growth. Using primary MEFs isolated from wild type and MKP-1-deficient mice, we have shown that in response to serum stimulation MKP-1 is dispensable for the inactivation of Erk, in agreement with previously published results (17Dorfman K. Carrasco D. Gruda M. Ryan C. Lira S.A. Bravo R. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 925-931PubMed Google Scholar). However, we found that MKP-1 plays a critical role in the inactivation of p38 MAPK and JNK in MKP-1-deficient fibroblasts stimulated with serum. In addition, under distinct stresses such as anisomycin and osmotic stress, we show that both p38 MAPK and JNK were hyperactivated in primary MKP-1-deficient MEFs as compared with wild type MEFs. Interestingly, under conditions of serum stimulation and osmotic stress, in the absence of MKP-1 both p38 MAPK and JNK activities were eventually attenuated. These results suggest that other phosphatases, presumably other MKPs, participate in the dephosphorylation of p38 MAPK and JNK. These other phosphatases/MKPs are likely to be much less effective in their ability to dephosphorylate p38 MAPK and JNK as compared with MKP-1, and thus a longer time is required for them to effectively dephosphorylate these MAPKs. While this work was in progress, a report from Zhao et al. (35Zhao Q. Shepherd E.G. Manson M.E. Nelin L.D. Sorokin A. Liu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 8101-8108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) demonstrated that macrophages isolated from these MKP-1-deficient mice exhibited hyperactivation of Erk, JNK, and p38 MAPK in response to lipopolysaccharide stimulation. Similar results in macrophages were also reported recently (36Nimah M. Zhao B. Denenberg A.G. Bueno O. Molkentin J. Wong H.R. Shanley T.P. Shock. 2005; 23: 80-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). We have observed hyperactivation of p38 MAPK, JNK, and Erk in the livers of MKP-1-deficient mice. 2J. J. Wu and A. M. Bennett, unpublished observations. It appears therefore that in vivo MKP-1 also has the capacity to effectively dephosphorylate Erk. Nevertheless, the data presented here are in line with those recently published that, together, provide strong support for the conclusion that MKP-1 is a critical stress-responsive MKP in the attenuation of p38 MAPK and JNK activities. The involvement of MKP-1 in the regulation of gene expression has been demonstrated through numerous studies in which overexpression of MKP-1 attenuates the activation of genes whose transcription is dependent upon MAPK activity. However, work by Dorfman et al. (17Dorfman K. Carrasco D. Gruda M. Ryan C. Lira S.A. Bravo R. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 925-931PubMed Google Scholar) suggested that MKP-1 was not critical for the attenuation of MAPK-mediated gene expression of c-fos because MKP-1-deficient MEFs display unaltered c-fos induction as compared with MKP-1+/- MEFs following serum stimulation. We have now identified CREB as a transcriptional target that is critically dependent upon the expression of MKP-1 for its down-regulation. MKP-1-deficient MEFs in response to FSK exhibited enhanced activation of p38 MAPK and phosphorylation of CREB. This subsequently led to an enhanced level of CRE-dependent gene expression in MKP-1-deficient MEFs stimulated with FSK. These data are somewhat provocative given that the cAMP/CREB pathway has been implicated in a number of important physiological processes such as metabolic homeostasis, synaptic plasticity, and immune regulation. These results therefore provide insight into other physiological areas in which MKP-1 may play essential roles in vivo. It has remained somewhat of an unresolved issue as to whether MKP-1 is important for the regulation of cell growth. Several studies have demonstrated that overexpression of MKP-1 inhibits cell proliferation (27Brondello J.M. McKenzie F.R. Sun H. Tonks N.K. Pouysségur J. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1895-1904PubMed Google Scholar, 28Sun H. Tonks N.K. Bar-Sagi D. Science. 1995; 266: 285-288Crossref Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 29Noguchi T. Metz R. Chen L. Mattei M-G. Carrsaco D. Bravo R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5195-5205Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), implying that MKP-1 is a negative regulator of cell growth. This interpretation, however, was not supported by Dorfman et al. (17Dorfman K. Carrasco D. Gruda M. Ryan C. Lira S.A. Bravo R. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 925-931PubMed Google Scholar), who found equivalent rates of cell proliferation between MKP-1+/- and MKP-1-/- MEFs. We show that MKP-1+/- and MKP-1-/- MEFs when compared with wild type MEFs proliferate at a significantly slower rate. These data demonstrate that MKP-1 is in fact required to promote cell proliferation. This interpretation opposes the current dogma that MKP-1 is a negative regulator of cell growth. To resolve this issue, we investigated whether the reduced cell growth in MKP-1-deficient MEFs was a result of enhanced cell death. This indeed was the case, because proliferating MKP-1-deficient MEFs exhibited enhanced levels of cell death as compared with wild type MEFs. Moreover, we were able to rescue the enhanced level of cell death using SB203580, the p38 MAPK inhibitor, but not with SP600125, the JNK inhibitor. The reason for the potentiation of the enhanced cell death when MKP-1-deficient MEFs were treated with SP600125 is unclear. However, the specificity of SP600125 to JNK has been questioned (37Bain J. McLauchlan H. Elliott M. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2003; 371: 199-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (1235) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, it is still reasonable to conclude that the effects of enhanced cell death in proliferating MKP-1-deficient MEFs can be attributed to increased levels of p38 MAPK, but not JNK, activity. Consistent with the enhanced activity of p38 MAPK and JNK in response to anisomycin, MKP-1-deficient MEFs exhibited increased levels of apoptosis as compared with wild type MEFs. Although it has been suggested that MKP-1 may function in an anti-apoptotic manner, these data definitively demonstrate that MKP-1 functions as a critical anti-apoptotic regulator. Our results are consistent with the recent report that MKP-1-deficient mice show greater infarction injury as compared with wild type controls (38Kaiser R.A. Bueno O.F. Lips D.J. Doevendans P.A. Jones F. Kimball T.F. Molkentin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15524-15530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Interestingly, in the early stages of prostate cancer, MKP-1 is overexpressed and this is associated with decreased apoptosis, suggesting that MKP-1 overexpression may be causally linked to the prevention of cancer cell apoptosis (10Srikanth S. Franklin C.C. Duke R.C. Kraft R.S. Mol. Cell Biochem. 1999; 199: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 39Magi-Galluzzi C. Mishra R. Fiorentino M. Montironi R. Yao H. Capodieci P. Wishnow K. Kaplan I. Stork P.J. Loda M. Lab. Investig. 1997; 76: 37-51PubMed Google Scholar). Our findings therefore, support the idea that MKP-1 inactivation may be a valid strategy to sensitize cancer cell death in combination with conventional cancer chemotherapeutic strategies.

These abnormal phenotypes are controlled by an autosomal recessive gene (cn). In this study, linkage analysis using 115 affected mice of F2 progeny mapped the cn locus on an ∼0.8-cM region of chromosome 4, and natriuretic peptide receptor 2 (Npr2) gene was identified as the most potent candidate for the cn mutant in this region. This gene encodes a receptor for C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP) that positively regulates longitudinal bone growth by producing cGMP in response to CNP binding to the extracellular domain. Sequence analyses of the Npr2 gene in cn/cn mice revealed a T to G transversion leading to the amino acid substitution of highly conserved Leu with Arg in the guanylyl cyclase domain. In cultured chondrocytes of cn/cn mice, stimulus with CNP did not significantly increase intracellular cGMP concentration, whereas it increased in +/+ mice. Transfection of the mutant Npr2 gene into COS-7 cells also showed similar results, indicating that the missense mutation of the Npr2 gene in cn/cn mice resulted in disruption of the guanylyl cyclase activity of the receptor. We therefore concluded that the dwarf phenotype of cn/cn mouse is caused by a loss-of-function mutation of the Npr2 gene, and cn/cn mouse will be a useful model to further study the molecular mechanism regulating endochondral ossification by CNP/natriuretic peptide receptor B signal.

The skeleton of vertebrates is formed by two different processes, namely intramembranous and endochondral ossifications. The latter process leads to the development of long bones that comprise the appendicular skeleton and vertebrae. During endochondral ossification, mesenchymal cells initially differentiate into chondrocytes, and progress through proliferating, maturating, and hypertrophic stages with strict columnar alignment. Distal hypertrophic chondrocytes then undergo apoptosis and are replaced by trabecular bone. A large number of genes have been implicated in the mechanisms regulating these processes (1.Erlebacher A. Filvaroff E.H. Gitelman S.E. Derynck R. Cell. 1995; 80: 371-378Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar), and mutations of these genes often cause skeletal dysplasias with shortened extremities (2.Newman B. Wallis G.A.

The natriuretic peptide (NP) 1The abbreviations used are: NP, natriuretic peptide; ANP, atrial NP; BNP, brain NP; NPRA, NP receptor A; NPRB, NP receptor B; NPRC, NP receptor C; CNP, C-type NP; AMDM, acromesomelic dysplasia Maroteaux type. family comprises atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), and C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP) (4.Levin E.R. Gardner D.G. Samson W.K. N. Engl. J. Med. 1998; 339: 321-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (2066) Google Scholar), and three receptors for NPs, including natriuretic peptide receptor A (NPRA), natriuretic peptide receptor B (NPRB), and natriuretic peptide receptor C (NPRC), have been identified in mammals (5.Chinkers M.

Science. 1987; 238: 675-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar). NPRA and NPRB consist of extracellular ligand binding, transmembrane, protein kinase homology, and guanylyl cyclase catalytic domains. These receptors mediate ligand signals by producing an intracellular second messenger, cyclic GMP (cGMP) (2.Newman B. Wallis G.A. Clin. Genet. 2003; 63: 241-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Both ANP and BNP bind to NPRA with high affinity, and CNP prefers binding to NPRB (8.Suga S. Nakao K. Hosoda K. Mukoyama M. Ogawa Y. Shirakami G. Arai H. Saito Y. Kambayashi Y. Inouye K. Imura H. Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 229-239Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). NPRC has a ligand-binding domain and a short cytoplasmic domain that lacks guanylyl cyclase activity and is considered to be involved in NP clearance (7.Maack T. Suzuki M. Almeida F.A. Nussenzveig D. Scarborough R.M. McEnroe G.A. Lewicki J.A. Science. 1987; 238: 675-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar). ANP and BNP mainly reside in the atrium and ventricle, respectively, and act as cardiac hormones that regulate central fluid volume, blood pressure, and the development of cardiovascular tissues (9.Cameron V.A. Ellmers L.J. Endocrinology. 2003; 144: 2191-2194Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). On the other hand, CNP gene (Nppc) and NPRB gene (Npr2) expressions have been detected in mice tibial growth plates (10.Yamashita Y. Takeshige K. Inoue A. Hirose S. Takamori A. Hagiwara H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2000; 127: 177-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 11.Chusho H. Tamura N. Ogawa Y. Yasoda A. Suda M. Miyazawa T. Nakamura K. Nakao K. Kurihara T. Komatsu Y. Itoh H.

Since CNP stimulates the longitudinal growth of cultured fetal mouse tibias (13.Yasoda A. Ogawa Y. Suda M. Tamura N. Mori K. Sakuma Y. Chusho H. Shiota K. Tanaka K. Nakao K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11695-11700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) and CNP-deficient mice develop dwarfism due to impaired endochondral ossification (11.Chusho H. Tamura N. Ogawa Y. Yasoda A. Suda M. Miyazawa T. Nakamura K. Nakao K. Kurihara T. Komatsu Y. Itoh H. Tanaka K. Saito Y. Katsuki M. Nakao K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4016-4021Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar), the CNP/NPRB pathway has been considered to be involved in the process of endochondral ossification. However, there is no direct evidence that NPRB effects longitudinal bone growth by regulating endochondral ossification. The achondroplastic mouse is a mutant strain with an autosomal recessive gene (cn) that arose spontaneously in the AKR/J mouse strain (14.Lane P.W. Dickie M.M. J. Hered. 1968; 59: 300-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The homozygous (cn/cn) mouse exhibits disproportionate dwarfism with short limbs, short tail, and a domed skull. These phenotypes are distinguishable from normal littermates by 7 days after birth and thereafter gradually become more prominent (15.Silberberg R. Lesker P. Growth. 1975; 39: 17-33PubMed Google Scholar, 16.Johnson D.R. J. Anat. 1978; 125: 267-275PubMed Google Scholar). Histological analyses have revealed that the tibial epiphyseal growth plates of cn/cn mice are thinner than normal mice, and the hypertrophic chondrocyte zone is considerably narrowed (17.del Marco A. Reprod. Nutr. Dev. 1981; 21: 1025-1031Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 18.Wikstrom B. Hjerpe A. Reinholt F.P. Engfeldt B. Coll. Relat. Res. 1986; 6: 279-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). These findings suggested that the dwarf phenotype of cn/cn mouse was caused by retarded longitudinal bone growth due to disturbed endochondral ossification. Thus, the cn/cn mouse has been believed to be a useful model for hereditary human skeletal dysplasias. However, the gene responsible for the skeletal abnormalities of the cn/cn mouse has not yet been identified. In this study, we determined the chromosomal localization of the cn locus and identified the causative mutation in the Npr2 gene. Mice—Heterozygotes (cn/+) of mutant mice were obtained from the Jackson Laboratory, and the strain was maintained by sib mating of heterozygotes. JF1/Ms mice were obtained from the National Institute of Genetics, Mishima, Japan. Linkage Analysis—F1 mice were generated by mating heterozygous (cn/+) mice with JF1 (+/+) mice, and the F2 progeny was subsequently obtained from intercrossing heterozygous (cn/+)F1 mice. Genomic DNA was extracted from mouse livers by phenol/chloroform extraction. PCR reactions for microsatellite markers proceeded as follows: 35 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, 55–60 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 45 s. The primer sequences of newly generated microsatellite markers, D4Mok1 (5′-GATTTGAGTTTCTGACACCTCCC-3′ and 5′-ACTTGCTTGTTTGCGTGTGGGC-3′) and D4Mok2 (5′-TCCTTGGCTGATGCCTAAGC-3′ and 5′-GGTCTAGGAAGCTAACTCAGTGG-3′), were obtained from genomic sequences located at 42.2 Mb (GenBank™ accession number NT_039260) and 43.0 Mb (GenBank™ accession number NT_039296) positions on mouse chromosome 4, respectively. The reaction mixture for PCR (10 μl) contained 1× PCR buffer, 0.2 mm dNTP, a 0.5 μm concentration of each primer, and 0.25 unit of TaqDNA polymerase (Amersham Biosciences). The PCR products were fractionated on 3.0% agarose gels and stained with ethidium bromide. The data were analyzed using Map Manager computer software. Detection of Mutation in Npr2 Gene—Tibial RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The extracted RNA was then incubated with RNase-free DNase I (Takara, Ohtsu, Japan) for 1 h at 37 °C to remove contaminating genomic DNA. First strand cDNA was synthesized for reverse transcription-PCR using the Superscript preamplification system (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Npr2 cDNA was amplified with specific primer (5′-TGTATCCGGGCCGACTAAGCTTGC-3 and 5′-GGAAACACAGTGACCATTGCCCATCC-3′) under the following conditions: 94 °C for 2 min followed by 35 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 64 °C for 20 s, and 72 °C for 4 min. The amplified fragments were sequenced using an ABI PRIZM 310 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). To detect the mutation in the genomic DNA of mice by restriction enzyme digestion, DNA fragments, including exon 18 of Npr2 gene, were amplified from genomic DNA using specific primers (5′-TTCACAGCGCTGTCAGCTGAG-3′ and 5′-ACTTAGGGAGCGCTGACTGTGG-3′). PCR reaction was carried out as follows: 35 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 62 °C for 20 s, and 72 °C for 30 s. The PCR products were digested with AflIII restriction enzyme at 37 °C, and electrophoresed on 3% agarose gel. Culture of Mouse Chondrocytes and COS-7 Cells—Chondrocytes were prepared from the costal cartilage of cn/cn or +/+ mice (n = 5) at postnatal day 7 as described (19.Lefebvre V. Garofalo S. Zhou G. Metsaranta M. Vuorio E. De Crombrugghe B. Matrix Biol. 1994; 14: 329-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). COS-7 cells were obtained from the RIKEN cell bank (Tsukuba, Japan). These cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine medium, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C under 5% CO2 in air. The chondrocytes were seeded in 12-well multiwell plates, and cGMP levels were measured when the cells reached confluence. The COS-7 cells were plated at a density of 1 × 104 cells/well in 96-well multiwell plates and used for transfection after incubation for 24 h. Transient Expression of Npr2 Gene in Cultured Cells—Full-length Npr2 cDNA was amplified by reverse transcription-PCR with tibial RNA extracted from cn/cn or +/+ mice using primers containing EcoRI or the NotI site (5′-CGGAATTCTATCGCCATGGCACTGCCATC-3 and 5′-AGCAGAAGGCGGCCGCCCTGGGCTTTACAG-3′). PCR was performed at 94 °C for 2 min followed by 35 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 64 °C for 20 s, and 72 °C for 4 min. Amplified fragments were digested with EcoRI and NotI restriction enzyme and then ligated into pcDNA3.1 mammalian expression vector (Invitrogen). The COS-7 cells were transfected with the DNA constructs using FuGENE 6 (Roche Diagnostics), and the transfected cells were subjected to cGMP level measurement after incubation for 24 h. Measurement of cGMP Levels in Cultured Cells—The cultured cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.1% fetal bovine serum and 0.5 mm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine at 37 °C for 15 min. Thereafter, various concentrations of CNP were added to the medium, and the incubation proceeded at 37 °C for a further 15 min. The amount of cGMP was measured using a cGMP enzyme immunoassay Biotrak system (Amersham Biosciences). Mapping the cn Locus by Linkage Analysis—To determine the chromosomal localization of the cn locus by linkage analysis, heterozygous (cn/+) mice were crossed with JF1/Ms (+/+) mice. Heterozygotes (cn/+) of F1 mice were intercrossed, and 483 F2 progeny were obtained, including 115 affected and 368 normal mice. The ratio of affected to normal F2 progeny did not significantly differ from the expected 1:3 distribution of recessive inheritance. We initially examined the linkage between the cn locus and microsatellite markers on entire mouse chromosomes with ∼20-cM intervals using the 115 affected mice. Significant linkage was detected between the cn locus and markers on the proximal region of chromosome 4, indicating the localization of the cn locus on this region. To narrow the critical interval of the cn locus, we further genotyped eight markers located at the proximal region of chromosome 4. As shown in Fig. 1A, no recombination was observed between the cn locus and D4Mok1, and at least one recombination was observed with the other markers. These data indicated that the cn locus was mapped on the 0.8-cM interval between D4Mit182 and D4Mit109, D4Mit213, and D4Mit257 (Fig. 1B). Detection of Mutation in Npr2 Gene—By comparison of the linkage map with the mouse genome sequence, two genes, Npr2 and Rmrp, which are functionally related to the phenotypes of cn/cn mice, were found in the critical region of the cn locus (Fig. 1B). Mutations in human othologues of Npr2 and Rmrp genes have been found in patients with acromesomelic dysplasia Maroteaux type (20.Bartels C.F. Bukulmez H. Padayatti P. Rhee D.K. van Ravenswaaij-Arts C. Pauli R.M. Mundlos S. Chitayat D. Shih L.Y. Al-Gazali L.I. Kant S. Cole T. Morton J. Cormier-Daire V. Faivre L. Lees M. Kirk J. Mortier G.R. Leroy J. Zabel B.

Genet. 2004; 75: 27-34Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar) and cartilage-hair hypoplasia (21.Ridanpaa M. van Eenennaam H. Pelin K. Chadwick R. Johnson C. Yuan B. vanVenrooij W. Pruijn G. Salmela R. Rockas S. Makitie O. Kaitila I. de la Chapelle A. Cell. 2001; 104: 195-203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar), respectively. These human disorders are characterized by skeletal dysplasias with disproportionate short stature. Thus, we considered that these genes are the most likely candidate genes for the cn locus. To identify the causative mutation in these genes, we amplified and sequenced the entire coding region of these genes and compared the cn/cn and +/+ mice. The nucleotide sequence of the Rmrp gene showed no causative mutation, and the Rmrp gene was therefore excluded from the candidates. However, sequence analysis of the Npr2 cDNA fragment revealed a T to G transversion leading to an amino acid substitution of Leu to Arg at codon 885 in cn/cn mice (Fig. 2A). We confirmed this mutation by sequencing exon 18 of Npr2 genomic DNA in cn/cn mice (data not shown). To confirm whether the T to G substitution is unique to the cn mutant allele, PCR fragments including exon 18 of the Npr2 gene were amplified from five inbred strains of mice and digested by the AflIII restriction enzyme, for which a recognition site is generated by the T to G substitution. Consequently, a 348-bp fragment amplified from the cn mutant allele was digested with AflIII, whereas the fragments from +/+ and AKR/J, the original strain of cn/cn mouse, as well as other four strains, were not digested (Fig. 2C). These results indicated that the substitution of T to G in the Npr2 gene is specific to the cn mutant allele. Effect of the Missense Mutation on Guanylyl Cyclase Activity of NPRB—The Npr2 gene encodes a NPRB, which mediates CNP signals via cGMP production by its intracellular guanylyl cyclase domain. Since Leu at codon 885 on the guanylyl cyclase domain of NPRB is highly conserved among various species (Fig. 2B), this amino acid residue seemed critical for the domain function. To examine the effect of the amino acid substitution of NPRB on guanylyl cyclase activity, we measured the amount of cGMP produced by CNP stimulation in the chondrocytes obtained from the costal cartilage of cn/cn and +/+ mice. The levels of cGMP in the chondrocytes of +/+ mice increased dose-dependently in response to CNP stimulus, whereas the cGMP levels did not significantly change in cn/cn mice (Fig. 3A). Furthermore, we investigated the guanylyl cyclase activity in COS-7 cells transfected with the expression vector containing the mutant or wild-type Npr2 gene. Intracellular cGMP levels obviously increased in COS-7 cells transfected with the wild-type gene after exposure to 10−6m CNP, but no significant change was observed in COS-7 cells transfected with a mutant gene (Fig. 3B). Western blotting indicated equivalent amounts of NPRB proteins in both cells (data not shown). These results demonstrated that the missense mutation in the Npr2 gene impaired the guanylyl cyclase activity of NPRB. In this study, we precisely mapped the cn locus on chromosome 4 and identified a missense mutation in the Npr2 gene. This mutation leads to the substitution of highly conserved hydrophobic residues (Leu) with the hydrophilic residue (Arg) in the guanylyl cyclase domain of NPRB. We further confirmed that cGMP was not produced in response to CNP stimulus in cells expressing the mutant Npr2 gene. Therefore, it is likely that the guanylyl cyclase activity of NPRB in cn/cn mouse was disrupted by amino acid substitution in the highly conserved region of the guanylyl cyclase domain. Several lines of evidence have suggested that the Npr2 gene plays a critical role in regulating endochondral ossification. 1) The Npr2 gene is predominantly expressed in the proliferating and prehypertrophic chondrocytes of the epiphyseal growth plate (10.Yamashita Y.

We therefore concluded that the retarded longitudinal bone growth of cn/cn mouse resulted from cGMP deficiency in the chondrocytes during endochondral ossification caused by a loss-of-function mutation in the Npr2 gene. The cn/cn mice exhibit disproportionate dwarfism with short limbs and tail, and the prominent abnormality during endochondral ossification consists of decreased numbers of proliferating and hypertrophic chondrocytes in a narrowed epiphyseal growth plate (17.del Marco A. Reprod. Nutr. Dev. 1981; 21: 1025-1031Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 18.Wikstrom B. Hjerpe A. Reinholt F.P. Engfeldt B. Coll. Relat.

Anat. 1990; 172: 245-258PubMed Google Scholar). These skeletal phenotypes of cn/cn mice are morphologically and histologically very similar to those of CNP-deficient mice (11.Chusho H. Tamura N. Ogawa Y. Yasoda A. Suda M. Miyazawa T. Nakamura K. Nakao K. Kurihara T. Komatsu Y. Itoh H. Tanaka K. Saito Y. Katsuki M. Nakao K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4016-4021Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). In addition, decreased levels of cGMP are detected in both the tailbone of CNP-deficient mice and in cells expressing the mutated Npr2 gene (11.Chusho H. Tamura N. Ogawa Y. Yasoda A. Suda M. Miyazawa T. Nakamura K. Nakao K. Kurihara T. Komatsu Y. Itoh H. Tanaka K. Saito Y. Katsuki M. Nakao K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4016-4021Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Although CNP not only binds to NPRB with high affinity but also binds NPRA with low affinity (8.Suga S. Nakao K. Hosoda K. Mukoyama M. Ogawa Y. Shirakami G. Arai H. Saito Y. Kambayashi Y. Inouye K. Imura H. Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 229-239Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27.Koller K.J. Lowe D.G. Bennett G.L. Minamino N. Kangawa K. Matsuo H. Goeddel D.V. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 769-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), NPRA is expressed slightly in mouse tibia (13.Yasoda A. Ogawa Y. Suda M. Tamura N. Mori K. Sakuma Y. Chusho H. Shiota K. Tanaka K. Nakao K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11695-11700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), and NPRA-deficient mice show no skeletal abnormality (29.Lopez M.J. Wong S.K. Kishimoto I. Dubois S. Mach V. Friesen J. Garbers D.L. Beuve A. Nature. 1995; 378: 65-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). Taken together, these findings indicate that the NPRB/cGMP pathway selectively mediates the CNP signal to promote longitudinal bone growth by regulating endochondral ossification. Although the phenotypes of cn/cn and CNP-deficient mice are similar in terms of gross appearance and in the histological features of tibial growth plate, the survival rates of these mice are quite different. The mortality of CNP-deficient mice is 70% at 100 days of age (11.Chusho H. Tamura N. Ogawa Y. Yasoda A. Suda M. Miyazawa T. Nakamura K. Nakao K. Kurihara T. Komatsu Y. Itoh H. Tanaka K. Saito Y. Katsuki M. Nakao K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4016-4021Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar), while that of the cn/cn mice used in this study was less than 10% (data not shown). CNP functions not only in endochondral ossification but also in cardiovascular regulation and vascular tone (30.Tokudome T. Horio T. Soeki T. Mori K. Kishimoto I. Suga S. Yoshihara F. Kawano Y. Kohno M. Kangawa K. Endocrinology. 2004; 145: 2131-2140Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In addition, CNP has been detected in various tissues such as the brain, spinal cord, heart, kidney, lung, thymus, liver, stomach, uterus, and ovary (31.Stepan H. Leitner E. Bader M. Walther T. Regul. Pept. 2000; 95: 81-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Thus, the CNP signal, possibly mediated by other receptor(s) including NPRA, might play a role in these tissues other than skeletal tissues. Another possible explanation for this discrepancy in mortality is their distinct genetic backgrounds. Lane and Dickie (14.Lane P.W. Dickie M.M. J. Hered. 1968; 59: 300-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) described that most cn/cn mice used in their study died before 3 months of age. The cn/cn mice used in their study had an AKR/J background, while the cn/cn mice used in this study had a mixed background of C57BL/6J, C3H/HeDiSn, and LG/J (14.Lane P.W. Dickie M.M. J. Hered. 1968; 59: 300-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 25.Thurston M.N. Johnson D.R. Kember N.F. J. Anat. 1985; 140: 425-434PubMed Google Scholar). Since it is unclear whether cn/cn and the CNP-deficient mice died from the same causes, further studies on the cause of death of cn/cn and the CNP-deficient mice with an identical genetic background would provide a novel function of CNP and/or NPRB in tissues other than in bone growth. Acromesomelic dysplasia Maroteaux type (AMDM) is an autosomal recessive human disorder characterized by disproportionate short stature and shortening of the extremities (32.Maroteaux P. Martinelli B. Campailla E. Presse Med. 1971; 79: 1839-1842PubMed Google Scholar), but its exact etiology remains unclear because of the lack of a suitable animal model for this disorder. Mutations in the NPR2 gene have recently been identified in affected families, and declined guanylyl cyclase activities of NPRB of mutant alleles have also been observed (20.Bartels C.F. Bukulmez H. Padayatti P. Rhee D.K. van Ravenswaaij-Arts C. Pauli R.M. Mundlos S. Chitayat D. Shih L.Y. Al-Gazali L.I. Kant S. Cole T. Morton J. Cormier-Daire V. Faivre L. Lees M. Kirk J. Mortier G.R. Leroy J.

With respect to the symptoms of AMDM, the disproportionately short limbs become more apparent during childhood than during the postnatal and neonatal periods (33.Langer L.O. Garrett R.T. Radiology. 1980; 137: 349-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The skeletal abnormalities of cn/cn mice also became progressively more obvious with age (15.Silberberg R. Lesker P. Growth. 1975; 39: 17-33PubMed Google Scholar, 16.Johnson D.R. J. Anat. 1978; 125: 267-275PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, cn/cn mouse is a useful model for investigating the pathogenesis and therapeutic approaches of AMDM. It is apparent that both CNP and cGMP signals play important roles in the regulation of endochondral ossification. However, the precise role of the signal pathway through NPRB during endochondral ossification remains unclear. The cn/cn mouse is the first animal model with a mutated Npr2 gene and can be used to evaluate the physiological function of NPRB. In cn/cn mice, the proliferative activities of proliferating chondrocytes in the epiphyseal growth plate are significantly lower than in control mice (25.Thurston M.N. Johnson D.R. Kember N.F. J. Anat. 1985; 140: 425-434PubMed Google Scholar, 26.Sannasgala S.S. Johnson D.R. J. Anat. 1990; 172: 245-258PubMed Google Scholar). The numbers of proliferating and hypertrophic chondrocytes are also severely reduced in cn/cn mice (17.del Marco A. Reprod. Nutr. Dev. 1981; 21: 1025-1031Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 18.Wikstrom B. Hjerpe A. Reinholt F.P. Engfeldt B. Coll. Relat. Res. 1986; 6: 279-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). The signal pathway through NPRB therefore appears to positively affect chondrocyte proliferation and differentiation. However, further studies are needed to elucidate how this pathway regulates chondrocyte proliferation and differentiation. Fibroblast growth factor 3 (FGFR3) is a one of the most important factors that negatively regulate the proliferation and differentiation of chondrocytes (34.Naski M.C. Colvin J.S. Coffin J.D. Ornitz D.M. Development (Camb.). 1998; 125: 4977-4988PubMed Google Scholar). Mice expressing constitutively activated Fgfr3 histologically exhibit very similar chondrocytic abnormalities in the epiphyseal growth plates to those of cn/cn mice (34.Naski M.C. Colvin J.S. Coffin J.D. Ornitz D.M. Development (Camb.). 1998; 125: 4977-4988PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, CNP transgenic mice rescue the achondroplastic phenotype of Fgfr3 mutant mice by inhibiting the MAPK pathway through FGFR3, and new therapeutic approaches via the activation of CNP/NPRB have been suggested for the treatment of human achondroplasia (28.Yasoda A. Komatsu Y. Chusho H. Miyazawa T. Ozasa A. Miura M. Kurihara T. Rogi T. Tanaka S. Suda M. Tamura N. Ogawa Y. Nakao K. Nat. Med. 2004; 10: 80-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Taken together, CNP signals mediated by NPRB might regulate chondrocyte proliferation and differentiation during endochondral ossification through modification of the signal from FGFR3. Further studies using cn/cn mice, as well as CNP-deficient mice, will help to clarify the role of the CNP/NPRB/cGMP pathway in chondrocytes during endochondral ossification and to develop novel therapeutic approaches for human skeletal dysplasias."
https://openalex.org/W2006005895,"The flagellum of Methanococcus voltae is composed of four structural flagellin proteins FlaA, FlaB1, FlaB2, and FlaB3. These proteins possess a total of 15 potential N-linked sequons (NX(S/T)) and show a mass shift on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel indicating significant post-translational modification. We describe here the structural characterization of the flagellin glycan from M. voltae using mass spectrometry to examine the proteolytic digests of the flagellin proteins in combination with NMR analysis of the purified glycan using a sensitive, cryogenically cooled probe. Nano-liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis of the proteolytic digests of the flagellin proteins revealed that they are post-translationally modified with a novel N-linked trisaccharide of mass 779 Da that is composed of three sugar residues with masses of 318, 258, and 203 Da, respectively. In every instance the glycan is attached to the peptide through the asparagine residue of a typical N-linked sequon. The glycan modification has been observed on 14 of the 15 sequon sites present on the four flagellin structural proteins. The novel glycan structure elucidated by NMR analysis was shown to be a trisaccharide composed of β-ManpNAcA6Thr-(1–4)-β-Glc-pNAc3NAcA-(1–3)-β-GlcpNAc linked to Asn. In addition, the same trisaccharide was identified on a tryptic peptide of the S-layer protein from this organism implicating a common N-linked glycosylation pathway.

In addition, the same trisaccharide was identified on a tryptic peptide of the S-layer protein from this organism implicating a common N-linked glycosylation pathway. Glycosylation of prokaryotic proteins is now well accepted, and examples of N- and O-glycosylation and of attachment of glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchors can now be found in the literature (1Benz I. Schmidt M.A. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 45: 267-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 2Messner P. Schaffer C. Herz W. Falk H. Kirby G.W. Progress in the Chemistry of Organic Natural Products. Springer Verlag, Wien, Germany2002: 51-124Google Scholar). However, in contrast to eukaryotic glycosylation systems, prokaryotic systems display considerable diversity in the structure of the respective glycans and the proximal monosaccharide linkage. As a consequence there is considerable interest in determining the structural and genetic basis of glycan production among these diverse prokaryotic systems. The archaeal flagellum is a unique motility structure that is distinct from the well characterized bacterial flagellum (3Thomas N.A. Bardy S.L. Jarrell K.F. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2001; 25: 147-174Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to bacterial flagellar assembly where newly synthesized flagellin is incorporated at the distal tip of the filament, it is believed that mature archaeal flagellin is incorporated at the base of the filament. In recent studies, the assembly of archaeal flagellum has been shown to more closely resemble a second bacterial motility system, the type IV pilus, where the structural protein pilin is synthesized with an unusual signal peptide and a hydrophobic N terminus. In Archaea, signal peptidases have been shown to cleave a signal peptide of the preflagellin proteins to produce mature flagellin, which is then incorporated into the filament (4Bardy S.L. Jarrell K.F. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 50: 1339-1347Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Flagellated archaeal species have one to five flagellin genes organized into a fla locus (3Thomas N.A. Bardy S.L. Jarrell K.F. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2001; 25: 147-174Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The marine archaeon Methanococcus voltae has four flagellin structural genes organized in two transcriptional units: one unit contains flaA, whereas the second unit contains flaB1, flaB2, and flaB3 along with other co-transcribed accessory genes (3Thomas N.A. Bardy S.L. Jarrell K.F. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2001; 25: 147-174Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Bardy S.L. Ng S.Y. Jarrell K.F. J. Mol. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2004; 7: 41-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Early work demonstrated that FlaB1 and FlaB2 are the major species of the extended filament, whereas FlaB3 is localized proximal to the cell surface and is a major component of the curved hook region. The minor component FlaA is believed to be distributed throughout the filament (6Bardy S.L. Mori T. Komoriya K. Aizawa S. Jarrell K.F. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 5223-5233Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Glycosylation of archaeal flagellin using glycoprotein-specific stains such as thymol sulfuric acid or periodic acid-Schiff is commonly reported (7Faguy D.M. Bayley D.P. Kostyukova A.S. Thomas N.A. Jarrell K.F. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 902-905Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Kalmokoff M.L. Jarrell K.F. Koval S.F. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 1752-1758Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), although a detailed structural analysis of the post-translational modification present is limited to a single organism, Halobacterium salinarum (formerly Halobacterium halobium) (9Ventosa A. Oren A. Int. J. Syst. Bacteriol. 1996; 46: 347-348Crossref Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The flagellin of this organism has been shown to be glycosylated with N-linked sulfated oligosaccharides composed of glucose in 1,4 linkage to hexuronic acids (10Sumper M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 906: 69-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 11Wieland F. Paul G. Sumper M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 15180-15185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This post-translational modification is also found on purified S-layer protein from this organism. This is in marked contrast to recent studies of bacterial flagellin glycosylation in Campylobacter, Helicobacter, Pseudomonas, and Listeria where each unique glycan was shown to be O-linked to the respective flagellin proteins (12Thibault P.

Although the M. voltae flagellins did not react with glycoprotein-specific stains, these proteins possess a total of 15 potential N-linked sequons (NX(S/T)) and show a mass shift on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel suggesting significant post-translational modification. In this study we provide a detailed structural characterization of the unique glycan found on all of the M. voltae flagellin proteins and demonstrate that the S-layer protein is also post-translationally modified with the same novel trisaccharide. Microbial Strains and Growth Conditions—M. voltae cells were grown in Balch medium III under a head space gas mixture of 80% H2, 20% CO2 at 37 °C as described previously (8Kalmokoff M.L. Jarrell K.F. Koval S.F. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 1752-1758Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Flagellin and S-layer Purification—Crude flagellar filament preparations were isolated by shearing followed by banding in a KBr gradient (8Kalmokoff M.L. Jarrell K.F. Koval S.F. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 1752-1758Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For isolation of flagella containing some attached basal structure (whole intact flagella), cells were extracted with the non-ionic detergent OP-10 without prior flagella shearing as described by Bardy et al. (6Bardy S.L. Mori T. Komoriya K. Aizawa S. Jarrell K.F. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 5223-5233Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). S-layer protein was released from M. voltae membranes by heat treatment at 60°C for 1 h in 50 mm HEPES buffer as described previously (16Koval S.F. Jarrell K.F. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 1298-1306Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Preflagellin Peptidase Reaction—A non-glycosylated form of FlaB2 was produced in Escherichia coli as described previously (17Correia J.D. Jarrell K.F. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 855-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). This form has the signal peptide of FlaB2 still attached. To remove this, E. coli membranes containing FlaB2 were used as substrate in an in vitro preflagellin peptidase assay using M. voltae membranes as a source of the preflagellin peptidase. Both the unprocessed and processed forms of FlaB2 are detected in a Western blot using anti-flagellin antisera (17Correia J.D. Jarrell K.F. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 855-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Enzymatic Digestion of Flagellin and S-layer Protein—Flagellin or S-layer protein extract (50–200 μg) was digested with either trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI) or Glu-C (Roche Applied Science) at a ratio of 40:1 (protein:enzyme, v/v) in 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.5, at 37 °C overnight. Double digestion was achieved by overnight incubation of the tryptic digest with Glu-C at the same ratio (40:1) at 37 °C. Nano-liquid Chromatography-Electrospray Tandem Mass Spectrometry Analysis—Protein digests were analyzed by nano-LC 1The abbreviations used are: LC, liquid chromatography; COSY, correlated spectroscopy; ESI, electrospray ionization; feCID, front end collision-induced dissociation; GlcNAc, 2-acetamido-2-deoxyglucose; GlcNAc3NAcA, 2,3-diacetamido-2,3-dideoxyglucuronic acid; HexNAc, N-acetylhexosamine; HMBC, heteronuclear multiple bond coherence; ManNAcA, 2-acetamido-2-deoxymannuronic acid; MS, mass spectrometry; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight; NOE, nuclear Overhauser effect; NOESY, nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy; TOCSY, total correlation spectroscopy; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; MS/MS, tandem MS. -MS/MS using a Q-TOF 2 hybrid quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer coupled to a CapLC capillary HPLC system (Waters, Milford, MA). The digests (0.5–1 μg) were separated on a 75-μm-inner diameter × 150-mm Inertsil ODS 3, 5-μm nano-HPLC column (Dionex/LC Packings, Sunnyvale, CA) using the following gradient conditions: 5–60% acetonitrile, 0.2% formic acid in 30 min; 60–90% in 5 min. The mass spectrometer was set to automatically acquire MS/MS spectra on doubly, triply, and quadruply charged ions. All MS/MS spectra were examined manually for the presence of unusual modifications. HPLC Purification of Tryptic Peptides—Fractionation of the flagellin tryptic digests was carried out using an Agilent 1100 series HPLC system equipped with a diode array detector (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA). The digests (25–40 μg) were separated on a 4.6 × 250-mm Jupiter C18 reverse phase column (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA) using the following gradient conditions: 5–40% acetonitrile, 0.2% formic acid (25 min); 40–95% (4 min); hold at 95% (1 min). The diode array detector was set at 254 nm to monitor the separation. Fractions were collected every minute starting at 4 min. The fractions were immediately evaporated to dryness on a SpeedVac preconcentrator; redissolved in 20 μl of acetonitrile, 5% acetic acid; and analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS using a Voyager-DE STR (Perseptive/Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Dihydroxybenzoic acid was used as the MALDI matrix. ESI-MS/MS and Front-end Dissociation MS/MS Analysis—HPLC fractions containing potential glycopeptides were analyzed by nano-ESI-MS/MS. Approximately 3 μl of each fraction were loaded into a nanoelectrospray emitter (Waters) and analyzed using the Q-TOF 2. Selected precursor ions were initially examined by MS/MS (50–80-eV collision energies, laboratory frame of reference), which confirmed the presence or absence of a glycan modification. More extensive sequencing analysis often required the use of front-end collision-induced dissociation to fragment the ions as they entered the mass spectrometer. This was achieved by increasing the orifice voltage from 30 to 90 V. Selected fragment ions were then analyzed by MS/MS as described above. This method was used to determine the site of glycan linkage and to generate fragment ion spectra of the glycan residue oxonium ions. Accurate mass measurement of the glycan oxonium ions in selected glycopeptide MS/MS spectra was achieved by using a number of the neighboring peptide fragment ions as internal mass standards. Plausible elemental formulas were then generated for each glycan greatly aiding the process of identifying the unusual glycan moieties. β-Elimination of Tryptic Peptides—To further confirm the nature of the glycan linkage, β-elimination was performed on a number of the glycopeptide-containing HPLC fractions (18Rademaker G.J. Thomas-Oates J. Methods Mol. Biol. 1996; 61: 231-241PubMed Google Scholar). Approximately 5 μlofthe selected fractions were dried, dissolved in 100 μl of 25% ammonium hydroxide (aqueous), and allowed to stand at room temperature for 6–18 h. The samples were then evaporated to dryness; redissolved in 10 μl of 5% acetonitrile, 5% acetic acid; desalted using C18 Ziptips (Millipore, Billerica, MA); and analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS in the manner described above. Flagellin from Campylobacter jejuni 81–176 was used as a positive control. This protein is extensively modified with O-linked glycans (12Thibault P. Logan S.M. Kelly J.F. Brisson J.R. Ewing C.P. Trust T.J. Guerry P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34862-34870Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Glycan Purification—Approximately 620 μg of flagellin protein containing an estimated 90 μg of glycan were digested with Pronase in 0.1 m Tris-HCl, 2 mm CaCl2, pH 8.0 (50:1 flagellin to Pronase). After incubation for 24 h at 37 °C a second aliquot of Pronase was added (same ratio), and the digestion was allowed to continue for another 24 h. The final digest was applied in turn to a Biogel P4 and to a P2 size exclusion column (Bio-Rad) in the manner described previously (5Bardy S.L. Ng S.Y. Jarrell K.F. J. Mol. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2004; 7: 41-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The eluate from each size exclusion column was collected in 2-ml fractions concentrated to 20 μl and analyzed by nano-ESI-MS/MS as described above. Glycan-containing fractions were then analyzed by NMR. NMR Analysis of Purified Glycan—NMR spectra were acquired at 20 °C on Varian INOVA spectrometers operating at 500 and 600 MHz (Varian Associates Inc., Palo Alto, CA). The purified glycan was lyophilized and redissolved in either D2O or, for experiments where exchangeable proton resonances were observed, 90% H2O. The sample volume was ∼150 μl. The measured pH in D2O (pD) uncorrected for D2O was 3. Standard two-dimensional homonuclear COSY, TOCSY, and NOESY spectra and selective 1D-1H TOCSY and NOESY spectra were acquired for the assignment of proton resonances within the glycan and were performed as described previously (19Brisson J.R.

Proton assignments were then used to identify cross-peaks in heteronuclear 1H-13C heteronuclear single quantum coherence and HMBC spectra required for complete structure determination. 1H and 13C chemical shifts were referenced with respect to the methyl group of an internal acetone standard, appearing at 2.225 and 31.1 ppm, respectively. All spectral data were acquired using standard sequences provided with VNMR 6.1 software (Varian Associates Inc.) and were processed with the software package TOPSPIN (Bruker Biospin, Billerica, MA). Intact Mass Analysis of M. voltae Flagellin—The apparent molecular masses of the M. voltae flagellins as determined by Western blotting with flagellin-specific antisera after SDS-PAGE are: FlaA, 27.5 kDa; FlaB1, 31 or 33 kDa; FlaB2, 31 or 33 kDa; and FlaB3, 34.5 kDa (Fig. 1). The antiserum raised against FlaB2 also reacts with FlaB1, and the two proteins have masses of 31 and 33 kDa. This is higher than the molecular masses deduced from the corresponding genes: FlaA, 23,905 Da; FlaB1, 22,513 Da; FlaB2, 22,799 Da; and FlaB3, 25,523 Da. When FlaB2 is overexpressed in E. coli, a protein of ∼26.5 kDa is detected by FlaB2 antiserum, corresponding to the FlaB2 protein with the signal peptide of 12 amino acids still attached. This signal peptide is not present on the mature flagellin protein isolated from intact flagella filaments of M. voltae. This signal peptide can be removed from the E. coli-produced FlaB2 in an in vitro preflagellin peptidase assay as shown in Fig. 1, lane 4 (17Correia J.D. Jarrell K.F. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 855-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). This processed FlaB2 produced in E. coli has an apparent molecular mass of 25 kDa, which represents a difference in molecular mass from the mature FlaB2 flagellin protein isolated from the methanogen of about 6–8 kDa. This is suggestive of significant post-translational modification of the protein occurring in M. voltae. Earlier attempts to stain the M. voltae flagellins with glycoprotein stains such as the periodic acid Schiff reagent were unsuccessful (21Faguy D.M. Jarrell K.F. Kuzio J. Kalmokoff M.L. Can. J. Microbiol. 1994; 40: 67-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Attempts to determine the intact mass of the respective flagellins by mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS and ESI-MS) have so far failed. Nano-LC-MS/MS Analysis of Flagellin Peptide Digests—Initially the tryptic digest of the flagellin proteins was analyzed by nano-LC-MS/MS. Many of the MS/MS spectra could be readily assigned to unmodified flagellin tryptic peptides. However, quite a number of the spectra were derived from peptides modified with what appeared to be a 779-Da glycan composed of three residues with masses of 318, 258, and 203 Da, respectively (Fig. 2A). Moreover the neutral loss fragmentation patterns suggested that the glycan is linked to the peptides via the 203-Da residue (which is almost certainly a N-acetylhexosamine (HexNAc)) and that the 318-Da moiety is the terminal residue. This was confirmed by the presence of the strong oxonium ion at m/z 319.1 and the almost complete absence of the HexNAc oxonium ion at m/z 204.1. The slightly weaker oxonium ion at m/z 259.1 and the disaccharide ion at m/z 577.2 (Fig. 2A) suggest that the 258-Da residue is centrally located within the linear trisaccharide. Although it was possible to infer the peptide sequence from the mass of the glycopeptide, the majority of the glycopeptide MS/MS spectra contained insufficient peptide fragment ions to confirm their identities. In these instances, feCID-MS/MS was performed on the deglycosylated peptide fragment ions to provide this evidence. For example, nano-ESI-feCID-MS/MS analysis of the deglycosylated fragment ion at m/z 890.4 observed in Fig. 2A confirmed the identity of this peptide as T100–106 from FlaB2 flagellin (Fig. 2C). A concerted effort was made to map the four flagellar proteins to identify as many sites of glycosylation as possible (Fig. 3). Nano-LC-MS and MS/MS analyses were performed on multiple tryptic digests, on Glu-C digests, and on tryptic/Glu-C double digests of the sheared flagellin isolates. This worked well for FlaB1 and FlaB2, the most abundant proteins in the flagellin. To improve the coverage of the less abundant proteins the same analyses were carried out on intact flagellin preparations that retained a partial anchoring structure. It has been demonstrated previously that the FlaB3 protein is enriched in these preparations (6Bardy S.L. Mori T. Komoriya K. Aizawa S. Jarrell K.F. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 5223-5233Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Improved coverage was obtained for FlaB1 (77%), FlaB2 (98%), and FlaB3 (71%). Two peptides for FlaA (13%) were also observed, including one glycopeptide (see Supplemental Table 1). These results are consistent with the fact that FlaA is the least abundant of the four flagellin components of the flagellar filament (6Bardy S.L. Mori T. Komoriya K. Aizawa S. Jarrell K.F. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 5223-5233Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In addition, FlaA may be resistant to enzymatic digestion as a consequence of its location within the flagellar filament. Linkage Site Determination—Examination of the glycopeptide amino acid sequences suggested that the glycan may well be N-linked to asparagine residues in the classic eukaryotic N-linkage consensus sequon (Asn-Xaa-(Ser/Thr)). In fact, our data indicated that 14 of the 15 N-linked sequons may carry the glycan. The only site that remained uncharacterized was the first N-linked sequon (26NTS28) of the FlaA flagellin protein. However, no peptides, modified or otherwise, were detected from this region of FlaA. To determine the exact site of glycan attachment we performed nano-ESI-feCID-MS/MS on the fragment ion of the T100–106 glycopeptide bearing only the 203-Da monosaccharide (Fig. 2B). The obtained spectrum contained ions that were attributed to b2 and b3 peptide fragments bearing the extra 203-Da mass (Fig. 2B, insets). These two ions were not present in the deglycosylated fragment ion m/z 890.4 as shown in Fig. 2C (insets). In addition, the only modified ion of the y series clearly visible on the spectrum is the y6 + 203 ion at m/z 930.4, which includes the asparagine residue. This pattern of ions could only occur if the monosaccharide is N-linked to the asparagine residue of the N-linked sequon 101NES103. No ions corresponding to O-linkage on either of the serines present in this peptide were observed. To confirm this finding we performed β-elimination of selected glycopeptide-containing fractions. Although the reaction successfully removed the O-linked glycans from the positive control (C. jejuni flagellin), no modification of the M. voltae flagellin glycopeptides was observed (data not shown). This confirms that the glycan linkage on these flagellin proteins is not O-linked. This N-linkage through an Asn residue was confirmed for an S-layer peptide (see below). MS/MS Analysis of the Glycan Moiety—Accurate mass measurements were performed on the glycan oxonium ions in the MS/MS spectra illustrated in Fig. 2 to determine possible empirical formulas for the unknown glycans. The known masses of peptide fragment ions were used as internal standards in a manner similar to that described previously (12Thibault P. Logan S.M. Kelly J.F. Brisson J.R. Ewing C.P. Trust T.J. Guerry P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34862-34870Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). The accurate masses and the top ranked, plausible elemental compositions are presented in Table I. The measured masses were within ±0.002 Da of the actual masses of the sugar residues as identified by NMR. The accurate mass and elemental formula for the N-linked sugar clearly indicated that this is a HexNAc, whereas that for the 258-Da sugar suggested that this is a di-N-acetyl hexuronic acid.Table IAccurate masses of the glycan oxonium ions and most plausible empirical formulaCarbohydrateOxonium ionResidue massElemental compositionm/zDaN-Linked204.087203.079C8H13NO5Second259.092258.084C10H14N2O6Distal319.112318.104C12H18N2O8 Open table in a new tab The m/z 259 and 319 glycan oxonium ions were examined by feCID-MS/MS (Fig. 4). The fragmentation pattern for the m/z 259 ion was especially informative (Fig. 4A). The ion at m/z 200 (loss of 59 Da) likely comes from the loss of an N-acetyl group. The subsequent loss of a ketene (42 Da) from this ion yields the strong fragment ion at m/z 158.1 and suggests the presence of a second acetate group. Loss of formic acid (46 Da) forms the ion at m/z 112.0 and suggests the presence of a carboxylic acid moiety. This fragmentation pattern plus the putative elemental composition provided in Table I provided strong evidence indicating that this is a di-N-acetyl hexuronic acid. This was later confirmed by NMR analysis. The fragmentation pattern of m/z 319 oxonium ion presented in Fig. 4B also yielded important information about the terminal monosaccharide although not enough to suggest a possible structure. The MS/MS spectrum was dominated by the successive loss of three water molecules from the precursor ion and is indicative of the presence of at least three hydroxyl groups. As with the 258-Da carbohydrate, loss of a ketene group and loss of formic acid suggested that this carbohydrate contains one carboxyl group and one N-acetyl group. S-layer Protein Glycosylation—In the MS/MS analysis of peptides from the intact flagella preparation we identified peptides from other M. voltae proteins, in particular the S-layer protein. There are two potential sites of N-linked glycosylation within the predicted sequence of this protein, and a tryptic peptide of increased mass due to an additional 779 Da was found during the nano-LC-MS/MS analysis of flagellin extracts. To confirm whether this protein was also glycosylated we digested a crude S-layer protein preparation and characterized a number of peptides by nano-LC-MS/MS (see Supplemental Table 1). We were able to obtain 59% coverage of the S-layer protein (Fig. 3) and we were also able to show that tryptic peptide T75–91, which contains one of the N-linked sequons, is indeed N-glycosylated with the 779-Da glycan (Fig. 5). NMR Structural Analysis of the Flagellin Glycan—Standard homo- and heteronuclear NMR techniques were used to completely characterize the structure of the novel N-linked flagellin glycan, which is presented in Fig. 6. The 1H spectrum indicated the presence of three anomeric protons at 5.05, 4.77, and 4.74 ppm, respectively. Because anomeric protons often give rise to well resolved peaks, selective excitation of these resonances within TOCSY and NOESY experiments are effective methods to assign scalar-coupled protons within the glycan units, determine intraresidual coupling constants, and establish inter-residual glycan linkages (22Brisson J.R.

TOCSY and NOESY spectra obtained through selective excitation of the three anomeric protons in the glycan are presented in Fig. 7. The vicinal coupling constants (8–10 Hz) and H-1 to H-3 and H-1 to H-5 intraresidual NOEs associated with the spectra from the anomeric protons at 5.05 (Fig. 7, residue a) and 4.74 ppm (residue b) are consistent with those of glucose residues in the β-pyranose configuration. The vicinal coupling constants of 1.3, 4.2, 9.9, and 9.8 Hz (±0.5 Hz) from H-1 to H-5, respectively, obtained from the TOCSY spectrum and the H-1 to H-3 and H-1 to H-5 NOEs observed in the NOESY spectrum acquired upon excitation of the anomeric resonance at 4.77 ppm (residue c) are consistent with that of mannose in the β-pyranose configuration. The sharp doublet seen for proton resonances at position 5 in both residues b and c (Fig. 7) indicates the presence of a carbonyl group at position 6.Fig. 7Selective excitation proton spectra of the N-linked flagellin glycan.A, TOCSY spectra with a mixing time of 80 ms acquired upon selective excitation of the anomeric resonances of residues a, b, and c.

https://openalex.org/W2103400963,"The amyloidogenic pathway leading to the production and deposition of Abeta peptides, major constituents of Alzheimer disease senile plaques, is linked to neuronal metal homeostasis. The amyloid precursor protein binds copper and zinc in its extracellular domain, and the Abeta peptides also bind copper, zinc, and iron. The first step in the generation of Abeta is cleavage of amyloid precursor protein by the aspartic protease BACE1. Here we show that BACE1 interacts with CCS (the copper chaperone for superoxide dismutase-1 (SOD1)) through domain I and the proteins co-immunoprecipitate from rat brain extracts. We have also been able to visualize the co-transport of membranous BACE1 and soluble CCS through axons. BACE1 expression reduces the activity of SOD1 in cells consistent with direct competition for available CCS as overexpression of CCS restores SOD1 activity. Finally, we demonstrate that the twenty-four residue C-terminal domain of BACE1 binds a single Cu(I) atom with high affinity through cysteine residues."

Previous studies have demonstrated the expression of P2Y1 and P2Y2 receptors in osteoclasts. The aim of this study was to determine whether osteoclast P2Y receptors signal through NF-κB, a key transcription factor regulating osteoclastogenesis. Immunofluorescence was used to detect the p65 subunit of NF-κB, which upon activation translocates from the cytosol to nuclei. Low levels of NF-κB activation were observed in untreated rabbit osteoclasts and in those exposed to 2-methylthio ADP (P2Y1 agonist) or ATP or UTP (P2Y2 agonists). In contrast, UDP or INS48823 (P2Y6 agonists) induced a significant increase in the number of cells exhibiting NF-κB activation, a process sensitive to the proteasome inhibitor lactacystin. In osteoclasts purified by micromanipulation, reverse transcription-PCR revealed the presence of P2Y1, P2Y2, and P2Y6 receptor transcripts, and application of agonists for these receptors induced the transient rise of cytosolic calcium. Treatment of rat osteoclasts with UDP or INS48823, but not 2-methylthio ADP or UTP, increased osteoclast survival. Osteoprotegerin (a decoy receptor for RANK ligand) did not significantly alter the effects of UDP on NF-κB localization or osteoclast survival, consistent with a direct action. Moreover, SN50 (cell-permeable peptide inhibitor of NF-κB) suppressed the enhancement of cell survival induced by UDP and INS48823. Our findings demonstrate the presence of functional P2Y6 receptors in osteoclasts. Thus, nucleotides, following their release at sites of inflammation and mechanical stimulation, can act through P2Y6 receptors to initiate NF-κB signaling and enhance osteoclast survival.

Nucleotides, such as ATP and UTP, are signaling molecules that mediate diverse biological effects following their release into the extracellular fluid. In trauma, nucleotides are released from damaged cells and activated platelets (1Born G.V. Kratzer M.A. J. Physiol. 1984; 354: 419-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). ATP is also released from nerve terminals in the peripheral and central nervous systems (2Burnstock G. Br. J. Anaesth. 2000; 84: 476-488Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar, 3Edwards F.A. Gibb A.J. Colquhoun D. Nature. 1992; 359: 144-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar). Mechanical stimulation or fluid shear stress induces the release of nucleotides including ATP and UTP in a variety of non-neuronal cells (4You J. Jacobs C.R. Steinberg T.H. Donahue H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48724-48729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 5Grygorczyk R. Hanrahan J.W. Am. J.

In the extracellular environment, ATP and UTP are degraded by a family of enzymes collectively called ecto-nucleotidases (7Zimmermann H. Braun N. Kegel B. Heine P. Neurochem. Int. 1998; 32: 421-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). ATP is degraded to ADP, AMP, and adenosine, whereas UTP is degraded to UDP, UMP, and uridine. ATP, UTP, as well as some of their degradation products are biologically active. Nucleotides act through the P2 family of cell surface receptors. P2Y receptors are G protein-coupled receptors that, in many cases, signal through the release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores, whereas P2X receptors are ligand-gated cation channels (8Ralevic V. Burnstock G. Pharmacol. Rev. 1998; 50: 413-492PubMed Google Scholar). To date, seven mammalian P2X receptors, P2X1–7, and at least eight P2Y receptors, P2Y1, 2, 4, 6, and 11–14, have been identified. P2X receptors are activated by adenine nucleotides, whereas P2Y receptors are activated by adenine and/or uridine nucleotides. P2Y1 receptors are activated selectively by ADP (9Jacobson K.A. Jarvis M.F. Williams M. J. Med. Chem. 2002; 45: 4057-4093Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). The P2Y2 receptor is activated by ATP and UTP with equal potency, and the human P2Y4 receptor is activated selectively by UTP, whereas at the rat P2Y4 receptor ATP and UTP are equipotent. The P2Y6 receptor is activated selectively by UDP (8Ralevic V. Burnstock G. Pharmacol. Rev. 1998; 50: 413-492PubMed Google Scholar). Osteoclasts are multinucleated cells with the unique ability to resorb bone. Together with bone forming osteoblasts, they regulate bone mass. A variety of endocrine and paracrine factors control osteoclast formation and life span. Until recently, it was believed that the major determinants of bone resorption were osteoclast proliferation and activation. However, growing evidence has led to the proposal that the control of the osteoclast life span is critical for the regulation of bone resorption (10Parfitt A.M. Mundy G.R. Roodman G.D. Hughes D.E.

Shalhoub V. Senaldi G. Guo J. Delaney J. Boyle W.J. Cell. 1998; 93: 165-176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4656) Google Scholar). RANK ligand signals by binding to its receptor RANK, a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily. The soluble, decoy receptor osteoprotegerin (OPG) also binds RANK ligand, preventing signaling. Multiple downstream transcription factors are activated during RANK signaling, including activator protein 1 and NF-κB (13Boyle W.J. Simonet W.S. Lacey D.L. Nature. 2003; 423: 337-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (4988) Google Scholar). Inactive NF-κB resides in the cytoplasm bound to the inhibitory protein IκB. Phosphorylation of IκB leads to its ubiquitination and degradation by the proteasome. IκB degradation permits NF-κB to translocate to the nucleus where it regulates the expression of a variety of genes involved in inflammation and immunity, cell proliferation, responses to stress, and apoptosis (14Karin M. Lin A. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 221-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (2470) Google Scholar). The essential role of NF-κB in osteoclast formation was demonstrated in mice deficient for both the p50 and p52 subunits of NF-κB (15Iotsova V. Caamano J. Loy J. Yang Y. Lewin A. Bravo R. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 1285-1289Crossref PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar). These mice showed a pronounced osteopetrotic phenotype as a result of the absence of osteoclasts. Previous studies have shown that low concentrations of ATP stimulate the resorptive activity and formation of rodent osteoclasts (16Morrison M.S. Turin L. King B.F. Burnstock G. Arnett T.R. J. Physiol. 1998; 511: 495-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). This effect was attributed to the P2Y1 receptor, because ADP and a selective P2Y1 agonist, 2MeSADP, stimulated osteoclast formation and resorption (17Hoebertz A. Meghji S. Burnstock G. Arnett T.R. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1139-1148Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Signaling through many P2Y receptors involves activation of phospholipase C (PLC) leading to the formation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores (8Ralevic V. Burnstock G. Pharmacol. Rev. 1998; 50: 413-492PubMed Google Scholar). In osteoclasts, several P2Y receptor agonists were shown to induce elevation of cytosolic free calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) through this pathway (18Weidema A.F. Dixon S.J. Sims S.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: C1531-C1539Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, immunocytochemistry and electrophysiological studies have shown the presence of P2Y2, P2X4, and P2X7 receptors in osteoclasts (19Hoebertz A. Townsend-Nicholson A. Glass R. Burnstock G. Arnett T.R. Bone. 2000; 27: 503-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 20Naemsch L.N. Weidema A.F. Sims S.M. Underhill T.M. Dixon S.J. J.

Our previous work demonstrated that P2X7 receptors couple to NF-κB signaling in osteoclasts (22Korcok J. Raimundo L.N. Ke H.Z. Sims S.M. Dixon S.J. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2004; 19: 642-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar); however, it was unknown whether P2Y receptors activate NF-κB as well. It is also unknown whether other P2Y receptors in addition to P2Y1 and P2Y2 are expressed in authentic osteoclasts. The aim of this study was to examine which P2Y receptors are expressed in osteoclasts and to determine whether they signal through NF-κB. Our results show that in addition to previously demonstrated P2Y1 and P2Y2 receptors, osteoclasts express functional P2Y6 receptors. We also establish that P2Y6 receptors couple to activation of NF-κB and promote osteoclast survival. Materials—Medium 199 (containing 25 mm HEPES and 26 mm HCO3−), HCO3−-free Medium 199 (25 mm HEPES), heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, and antibiotic solution (penicillin 10,000 units/ml; streptomycin 10,000 μg/ml; amphotericin B 25 μg/ml) were from Invitrogen. Nucleotides were purchased from Sigma. Mouse monoclonal antibody against the p65 subunit of NF-κB was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA; catalog number sc-8008). Mounting medium (Vecta-Shield) and biotinylated goat anti-mouse IgG were from Vector Laboratories (Burlingame, CA). Fluorescein-conjugated streptavidin and fluorescent probes TOTO-3 and fura-2-AM were from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). The P2Y6-selective agonist INS48823 was a generous gift from Inspire Pharmaceuticals (Durham, NC). The cell-permeable peptide inhibitor of NF-κB, SN50, the inactive control peptide, SN50M, and the irreversible proteasome inhibitor, lactacystin, were from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). RANK ligand (recombinant protein consisting of human residues 151–316 fused at the N terminus to a linker peptide and a FLAG tag) was purchased from Alexis Corp. (San Diego, CA), and OPG (recombinant protein consisting of human residues 21–194) was from Research Diagnostics Inc. (Flanders, NJ). Osteoclast Isolation and Culture—Osteoclasts were isolated from the long bones of neonatal New Zealand White rabbits and Wistar rats according to previously described procedures (21Naemsch L.N. Dixon S.J. Sims S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39107-39114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Rabbit and rat long bones were dissected free of soft tissues and cut with a scalpel to release bone fragments into 2–3 ml of osteoclast culture medium, which consisted of Medium 199 buffered with HEPES and HCO–3 supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum and 1% antibiotic solution. The cells were suspended by repeated passage through a pipette and plated on glass coverslips. The rabbit bone cell preparations were maintained at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 2 h after isolation, and then fresh culture medium was added. The cells were incubated at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 2–7 days before use. The majority of nonosteoclastic cells were removed using Pronase E (0.001% in PBS with 0.5 mm EDTA) at room temperature (22–25 °C) with intermittent agitation. When the majority of nonosteoclastic cells had been removed (1–5 min), the Pronase E solution was replaced with fresh medium. Samples partially purified with Pronase E were used for immunofluorescence studies and calcium measurements. To obtain homogeneous populations of osteoclasts for RNA isolation, some samples were further purified as follows. The bottom and edge of coverslips were cleaned with cotton swabs to remove adherent cells and were then placed in medium. Osteoclasts were identified by phase contrast microscopy as having three or more nuclei. Cells with fewer than three nuclei were removed using a micromanipulator and janitor pipette (20Naemsch L.N. Weidema A.F. Sims S.M. Underhill T.M. Dixon S.J. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 4425-4435Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), leaving pure preparations of 20–80 adherent multinucleated osteoclasts/coverslip. Following isolation, rat osteoclasts were incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 1 h, then gently washed with PBS to remove nonadherent cells, and incubated in fresh culture medium for 1–3 h before use. To quantify survival, the numbers of rat osteoclasts on coverslips were determined using a phase contrast microscope at time 0 (time of addition of test substances) and at 18 h. Osteoclasts were identified as having three or more nuclei. The number of surviving osteoclasts was expressed as a percentage of the number of osteoclasts at time 0 (100% = 98 ± 3 osteoclasts/coverslip, mean ± S.E., n = 278). These procedures were approved by the Council on Animal Care of the University of Western Ontario. Determination of NF-κB Localization by Immunofluorescence—Following 5–6 days in culture, rabbit osteoclasts on glass coverslips were incubated with test agents in osteoclast culture medium at 37 °C and, at the indicated times, washed in PBS, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (10 min), washed in PBS (2 × 10 min), permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS (10 min), washed in PBS (2 × 5 min), and blocked with 1% normal goat serum in PBS (blocking solution) for 1–2 h at room temperature. Osteoclasts were incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibody to the p65 subunit of NF-κB (diluted 1:100 in blocking solution). The coverslips were then washed and incubated for 2 h at room temperature with biotinylated secondary antibody diluted 1:100 in blocking solution, followed by washing and incubation with fluorescein-conjugated streptavidin (1:100 in PBS) for 30 min at room temperature. The nuclei were stained with TOTO-3 (2 μm), the coverslips were washed and mounted on slides, and the cells were observed using a Zeiss LSM 510 laser-scanning confocal microscope. All of the osteoclasts on each coverslip were examined (usually 150–200 osteoclasts/coverslip). The osteoclasts were rated positive for nuclear localization of NF-κB if the fluorescence intensity of three or more nuclei exceeded that of the cytoplasm. Reverse Transcription-PCR—Partial nucleotide sequences for rabbit P2Y receptors and ALP were obtained by PCR amplification of genomic DNA from rabbit brain using primers based on sequences previously published for rats and humans. These primer sequences were: P2Y1, sense 5′-GGCTTCCAGTTCTACTACCT-3′ and antisense 5′-GAGACTTGCTAGACCTCTTG-3′ (NM012800); P2Y2, sense 5′-ACACTAACCTCTACTGCAGCATCC-3′ and antisense 5′-TGACACCTGACTGAGCTGCTAT-3′ (NM017255); P2Y6, sense 5′-CATCCTCTTCCTCACCTGCATC-3′ and antisense 5′-CAGGAAGCTGATGGCAAAGGCA-3′ (NM176798); P2Y11, sense 5′-CACCTGCATCAGCCTCAACC-3′ and antisense 5′-CAGTGCTCTTGGCGTCCTCT-3′ (AF030335); and alkaline phosphatase (ALP), sense 5′-ATGTCTGGAACCGCACTGAA-3′ and antisense 5′-TCACCGTCCACCACCTTGTA-3′ (NM007431). For P2Y1, P2Y6 receptors, and ALP, the outer primers were the same as those used for PCR amplification of genomic DNA. For P2Y2 and P2Y11 receptors, rabbit sequences were used to design outer primers. The nested primers were also designed based on rabbit sequences (Table I). ALP was used as a control for osteoclast purity.Table IOligonucleotide primers used to detect P2Y receptors and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) by reverse transcription-PCRPrimerSenseAnti-senseSizebpP2Y1 outerGGCTTCCAGTTCTACTACCTGAGACTTGCTAGACCTCTTG804P2Y1 nestedCCATCTGGATGTTCGTCTTCTCTGAGGTGGTGTCATAGCA409P2Y2 outerTGTCTGAACGTCGTGGCGCTCAGACCAGGATGACGGCGAA506P2Y2 nestedTTCCTGTGCCGCCTCAAGACCATGACGGAGCTGTAGGCCA435P2Y6 outerCATCCTCTTCCTCACCTGCATCCAGGAAGCTGATGGCAAAGGCA421P2Y6 nestedCACCTGCATCAGCTTCCAGCGTCAGCAGGAAGCCAATGACCGTG259P2Y11 outerACTCGCCTTCTCCCGCCTCATTCTCTGTGCGTGACATGCTGG237P2Y11 nestedTGCAACAGGACCCAGCCCGAGTAGGCCAGCAGGGTGAGCA141ALP outerATGTCTGGAACCGCACTGAATCACCGTCCACCACCTTGTA478ALP nestedCCTTCGCTCTCCGAGATGGTTTCTTGTCCGTGTCGCT305 Open table in a new tab Total RNA was isolated from coverslips containing purified rabbit osteoclasts or bone cells (containing stromal cells and cells of both osteoblast and osteoclast lineages) using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen). Genomic DNA was removed by incubation with 0.05–0.1 unit/ml DNase I (amplification grade; Invitrogen) at 25 °C for 15 min followed by heat inactivation at 65 °C for 10 min. Typically, the RNA from a single coverslip was divided into two equal fractions. One fraction was not subjected to reverse transcription to detect genomic DNA contamination, and the second fraction was reverse transcribed into single-stranded cDNA using Superscript II (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. A portion (20–25%) of the resulting cDNA (or control sample that did not undergo reverse transcription) was used as template in each PCR performed with AdvanTaq Plus polymerase (Clontech Laboratories, Palo Alto, CA). Each 25-μl reaction contained 1 × AdvanTaq Plus PCR buffer, 0.2 mm of each dNTP, 0.2 mm primer, and 10% dimethyl sulfoxide (no dimethyl sulfoxide was used for PCR of P2Y1). PCR was performed with a hot start at 95 °C for 2 min, followed by 35–36 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, 64 °C for 30 s, and 68 °C for 1 min, with a final extension at 68 °C for 3 min. PCR using nested primers was carried out on first round PCR products using the protocol described above. PCR products were separated on a 1% agarose gel containing 0.5 μg/ml ethidium bromide and detected under UV illumination. Identities of amplified products were verified by sequencing of selected samples. Fluorescence Measurement of Cytosolic Free Ca2+Concentration— [Ca2+]i of single osteoclasts loaded with fura-2 was monitored using microfluorimetric techniques. Cells on glass coverslips were incubated for 40 min at room temperature in HCO–3-free osteoclast culture medium containing 1.5 μm fura-2-AM. The coverslips were then placed in a chamber mounted on the stage of a Nikon Diaphot inverted phase contrast microscope and bathed in HCO–3-free osteoclast culture medium supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum and 1% antibiotic solution. The ratio of fluorescence emission at 510 nm with alternate excitation wavelengths of 345 and 380 nm was measured using a Deltascan illumination system (Photon Technology International, London, Canada) as described previously (18Weidema A.F. Dixon S.J. Sims S.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: C1531-C1539Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Test substances were dissolved in the HCO–3-free osteoclast culture medium and applied locally to cells by pressure ejection from a micropipette. Statistical Analyses—Data are expressed as means ± S.E. The sample size (n) indicates the number of osteoclasts for Ca2+ fluorescence determinations or the number of separate cell preparations for immunofluorescence and survival studies. Unless otherwise indicated, the data were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance followed by a Bonferroni's post test. The differences were accepted as statistically significant at p < 0.05. UDP Induces NF-κB Translocation in Rabbit Osteoclasts— Activation of NF-κB results in its translocation from the cytoplasm to the nuclei. Our previous work demonstrated that immunofluorescence is an effective tool for examining NF-κB activation in rabbit osteoclasts (22Korcok J. Raimundo L.N. Ke H.Z. Sims S.M. Dixon S.J. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2004; 19: 642-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). To determine whether P2Y receptors activate NF-κB, rabbit osteoclasts were exposed to various P2Y receptor agonists. UDP (10 μm), an agonist at P2Y6 receptors, increased the proportion of osteoclasts displaying nuclear localization of NF-κB with a maximal effect at 3 h of exposure (Fig. 1, A and D). Control osteoclasts showed low levels of nuclear NF-κB for up to 4 h (Fig. 1B). The extent of NF-κB translocation was dependent on UDP concentration, with maximal effects observed at 10–100 μm UDP (Fig. 1E). In contrast to its action on osteoclasts, UDP did not induce NF-κB translocation in rabbit bone marrow stromal cells. After 3 h of exposure, 15 ± 7% of vehicle-treated and 16 ± 8% of UDP-treated stromal cells (Fig. 1C) showed nuclear localization of NF-κB (n = 3, p > 0.05). Thus, UDP induces activation of NF-κB in rabbit osteoclasts but not bone marrow stromal cells. To examine whether NF-κB activation occurs through P2Y receptors other than P2Y6, osteoclasts were exposed to 2MeSADP (P2Y1 receptor agonist) or UTP (P2Y2 receptor agonist) for 3 h, and the effect was compared with that of UDP (Fig. 2). In these experiments, osteoclasts exposed to 2MeSADP (10 μm) or UTP (10 μm) showed low levels of nuclear localization of NF-κB. Similarly, our previous results showed predominantly cytoplasmic localization of NF-κB in osteoclasts exposed to a low concentration of ATP (10 μm, a concentration sufficient to activate multiple P2 receptors including P2Y2 and P2X4 but not P2X7) (22Korcok J. Raimundo L.N. Ke H.Z. Sims S.M. Dixon S.J. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2004; 19: 642-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). In contrast, treatment with UDP (10 μm) significantly increased the percentage of osteoclasts with nuclear localization of NF-κB (Fig. 2, p < 0.05). Therefore, the P2Y6 receptor agonist UDP, but not agonists at other P2Y receptors, activates NF-κB in rabbit osteoclasts. The canonical pathway for NF-κB activation involves proteasome-mediated IκB degradation. To investigate the mechanism of UDP-induced NF-κB activation, we examined the effects of the specific proteasome inhibitor, lactacystin (23Lee D.H. Goldberg A.L. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 397-403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1252) Google Scholar). Lactacystin (10 μm) abolished UDP-induced NF-κB activation (Fig. 2B), consistent with involvement of the classical pathway for NF-κB activation. Expression of P2Y Receptors in Rabbit Osteoclasts—The presence of P2Y1 and P2Y2 receptors as well as P2X4 and P2X7 receptors has been previously shown in osteoclasts (17Hoebertz A. Meghji S. Burnstock G. Arnett T.R. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1139-1148Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 18Weidema A.F. Dixon S.J. Sims S.M. Am. J.

Chem. 2001; 276: 39107-39114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). To examine whether additional P2Y receptors are expressed on osteoclasts, reverse transcription-PCR was performed on heterogeneous populations of bone marrow cells (bone cells) as well as on osteoclasts purified by micromanipulation (osteoclasts). Bone marrow cells, containing cells of both osteoblast and osteoclast lineages, possessed transcripts for P2Y1, P2Y2, P2Y6, and P2Y11 receptors and ALP (used as a marker for cells of the osteoblast lineage) (Fig. 3Ai). In purified osteoclasts, expression of P2Y1 and P2Y2 receptors was confirmed. Moreover, the presence of P2Y6 receptor transcripts and the absence of P2Y11 transcripts were shown for the first time (Fig. 3Aii). P2Y1 and P2Y2 receptor agonists cause elevation of [Ca2+]i in osteoclasts (18Weidema A.F. Dixon S.J. Sims S.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: C1531-C1539Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We next examined whether P2Y6 receptors in osteoclasts also couple to Ca2+ signaling. Application of 2MeSADP (10 μm), UTP (10 μm), and UDP (10 μm) to single fura-2-loaded rabbit osteoclasts induced a transient rise in [Ca2+]i (Fig. 3B), indicating that P2Y1, P2Y2, and P2Y6 receptors induce Ca2+ signaling. In Jurkat T cells, elevations of [Ca2+]i enhance the activation of NF-κB (24Dolmetsch R.E. Xu K. Lewis R.S. Nature. 1998; 392: 933-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (1683) Google Scholar), so it is possible that Ca2+ is involved in nucleotide-induced activation of NF-κB in osteoclasts. Although all of the nucleotides tested caused a transient increase in [Ca2+]i, only the P2Y6 receptor agonist UDP activated NF-κB. Therefore, it appears that P2Y-mediated rise in [Ca2+]i alone is not sufficient to activate NF-κB in osteoclasts. The Role of P2Y6 Receptors in Osteoclast Survival—The physiological roles of P2Y6 receptors are poorly understood. In 1321N1 human astrocytes, activation of P2Y6 receptors prevents apoptosis induced by tumor necrosis factor α (25Kim S.G. Soltysiak K.A. Gao Z.G. Chang T.S. Chung E. Jacobson K.A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2003; 65: 923-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), suggesting that the P2Y6 receptor regulates cell survival. We assessed the effects of nucleotides on osteoclast survival using isolated rat osteoclasts, which spontaneously undergo apoptosis over a period of 24 h in culture. Osteoclasts treated with 2MeSADP (10 μm) or UTP (10 μm) had survival rates that were not significantly different from control (Fig. 4A). In contrast, RANK ligand (10 ng/ml) and UDP (10 μm) promoted osteoclast survival (Fig. 4A). Significant enhancement of osteoclast survival was observed at UDP concentrations of at least 3 μm (Fig. 4B). Possible Role of RANK Ligand in P2Y6 Receptor-mediated NF-κB Activation and Enhancement of Osteoclast Survival— Cells isolated from rabbit long bones include marrow stromal cells and cells of the osteoblast lineage. Osteoblasts express multiple P2Y receptors, including P2Y6 (26Maier R. Glatz A. Mosbacher J. Bilbe G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 240: 298-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Thus, extracellular nucleotides may act on osteoblasts to up-regulate expression of RANK ligand, which could then bind to its receptor RANK on osteoclasts activating NF-κB and increasing survival. To examine this possibility, osteoclast preparations were treated with the decoy receptor for RANK ligand, OPG. OPG did not affect basal levels of NF-κB activation. Moreover, treatment with OPG (100 ng/ml) for 20 min prior to and during 3 h of incubation with UDP (10 μm) did not prevent NF-κB activation (Fig. 5Ai). On the other hand, pretreatment with OPG significantly inhibited NF-κB activation induced by exogenous RANK ligand (100 ng/ml, 30 min), demonstrating the effectiveness of OPG (Fig. 5Aii). In keeping with these findings, treatment with OPG (100 ng/ml) did not significantly alter osteoclast survival under basal conditions or in the presence of UDP (10 μm, 18 h) (Fig. 5B). In contrast, OPG abolished the increase in survival induced by exogenous RANK ligand (10 ng/ml) (Fig. 5B). Thus, UDP induces nuclear translocation of NF-κB and enhances osteoclast survival independently of RANK ligand. The Role of NF-κB Activation in Osteoclast Survival—NF-κB plays an important role in controlling survival of a number of cell types (14Karin M. Lin A. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 221-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (2470) Google Scholar). To examine whether the effect of UDP on osteoclast survival is mediated through activation of NF-κB, we used the cell-permeable peptide inhibitor of NF-κB, SN50 (27Lin Y.Z. Yao S.Y. Veach R.A. Torgerson T.R. Hawiger J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14255-14258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (854) Google Scholar).

Proposed models suggest that ceramide induces cell death through interaction with latent binding sites on the outer or inner mitochondrial membranes, followed by an increase in membrane permeability, as an intermediate step in ceramide signal propagation. To investigate these models, we developed a new generation of positively charged ceramides that readily accumulate in isolated and in situ mitochondria. Accumulated, positively charged ceramides increased inner membrane permeability and triggered release of mitochondrial cytochrome c. Furthermore, the positively charged ceramide-induced permeability increase was suppressed by cyclosporin A (60%) and 1,3-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (90%). These observations suggest that the inner membrane permeability increase is due to activation of specific ion transporters, not the generalized loss of lipid bilayer barrier functions. The difference in sensitivity of ceramide-induced ion fluxes to inhibitors of mitochondrial transporters suggests activation of at least two transport systems: the permeability transition pore and the electrogenic H+ channel. Our results indicate the presence of specific ceramide targets in the mitochondrial matrix, the occupation of which triggers permeability alterations of the inner and outer mitochondrial membranes. These findings also suggest a novel therapeutic role for positively charged ceramides.

Ceramide is a pleiotropic lipid messenger that regulates a diverse range of cellular processes, including apoptosis, cell growth, and differentiation (1Hannun Y.A. Luberto C.

Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1585: 114-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar). Multiple studies show intimate connections between ceramide-induced cell death and mitochondrial function. Thus, several studies have implicated changes in mitochondrial function as an intermediate step in transduction of ceramide signals, especially with respect to ceramide-dependent apoptotic and necrotic cell death (4Mimeault M. FEBS Lett. 2002; 530: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 6Arora A.S. Jones B.J. Patel T.C. Bronk S.F. Gores G.J. Hepatology. 1997; 25: 958-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Ceramide has been shown to alter mitochondrial function by two major pathways, indirect and direct. Indirectly, ceramide modifies the activity of proapoptotic and anti-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family of proteins, which, in turn, alter the outer mitochondrial membrane permeability for cytochrome c and other pro-apoptotic molecules. In this pathway, targets for ceramide are non-mitochondrial molecules: cathepsin D, which triggers translocation of Bax to the mitochondria (5Pettus B.J. Chalfant C.E. Hannun Y.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1585: 114-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar, 7Bidere N. Lorenzo H.K. Carmona S. Laforge M. Harper F. Dumont C. Senik A. J. Biol.

Peters C. Brunner J. Kronke M. Schutze S. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5252-5263Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar), and serine/threonine protein phosphatase 2A, which dephosphorylates Bcl-2, thereby decreasing its anti-apoptotic activity (9Ruvolo P.P. Deng X. Ito T. Carr B.K. May W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20296-20300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). An additional substrate for protein phosphatase 2A is the serine/threonine kinase Akt/protein kinase B (5Pettus B.J. Chalfant C.E. Hannun Y.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1585: 114-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar). Protein phosphatase 2A inactivation of Akt results in dephosphorylation and activation of pro-apoptotic Bad, an Akt immediate substrate (10Datta S.R. Dudek H. Tao X. Masters S. Fu H. Gotoh Y. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1997; 91: 231-241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4894) Google Scholar). The overall effect of ceramide on this pathway is an increase in pro-apoptotic proteins bound to mitochondria. Evidence is also accruing to implicate direct actions of ceramide on mitochondria. Specifically, the selective hydrolysis of a mitochondrial pool of sphingomyelin by bacterial sphingomyelinase targeted to the mitochondrial matrix results in apoptosis, whereas production of ceramide in the plasma membrane, endoplasmic reticulum, nucleus, and Golgi apparatus by bacterial sphingomyelinase targeted to these compartments has no effect on cell viability (11Birbes H. El Bawab S. Hannun Y.A. Obeid L.M. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 2669-2679Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). This study therefore pointed to a local action of ceramide on mitochondria in intact cells. In this context, modulation by ceramide of mitochondrial functions at the level of isolated organelles has provided further evidence in support of this second mechanism. It has been reported that ceramides directly suppress respiratory chain activity (12Garcia-Ruiz C. Colell A. Mari M. Morales A. Fernandez-Checa J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11369-11377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar, 13Gudz T.I. Tserng K.Y. Hoppel C.L. J. Biol.

Moreover, current research is focused on the ability of ceramides to release cytochrome c from the intermembrane space and to induce permeability of the inner mitochondrial membrane, permitting passage of low molecular solutes. In the models of Siskind et al. (15Siskind L.J. Davoody A. Lewin N. Marshall S. Colombini M. Biophys. J. 2003; 85: 1560-1575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 16Siskind L.J. Kolesnick R.N. Colombini M. J. Biol.

In contrast, Pastorino et al. (18Pastorino J.G. Tafani M. Rothman R.J. Marcinkeviciute A. Hoek J.B. Farber J.L. Marcineviciute A. J. Biol.

Yet another report by Di Paola et al. (14Di Paola M. Cocco T. Lorusso M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 6660-6668Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) provides evidence for the role of ceramide as a nonspecific modulator of ionic permeability of the lipid component of the inner membrane. Thus, the proposed mechanism by which ceramides alter mitochondrial membrane permeabilization are varied, and the localization of functionally significant ceramide targets (outer mitochondrial membrane, inner membrane, or matrix space) is also unclear. Given these intimate and direct connections between ceramide and mitochondria, we sought to develop a strategy by which ceramide can be selectively delivered to the mitochondrial matrix to probe its mechanisms of action. In this study, we report on the development of derivatives of ceramide with a fixed positive charge (Fig. 1). These molecules are expected to accumulate in the mitochondrial matrix based on their electrochemical potential and thus would serve as direct probes of ceramide functions on mitochondria. Our results show that these novel agents do localize selectively in mitochondria in living cells. We next investigated the effects of these ceramides on permeability of the inner and outer mitochondrial membranes. Our study shows that these positively charged ceramides increase permeability of the inner membrane (decrease in Δψ and large amplitude swelling), which, in turn, results in release of cytochrome c. In addition, we provide evidence that ceramide-induced permeabilization of the inner mitochondrial membrane is mediated by specific ion transport systems, viz. the PTP and electrogenic H+ transporter. Materials—RPMI 1640 medium, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and fetal bovine serum were from Invitrogen. TMRM was from Molecular Probes, Inc. C6-NBD-ceramide was from Matreya. Ceramides and their derivatives were from the Lipidomics Core of the Medical University of South Carolina. All other reagents were from Sigma. Preparation of Mitochondria from Rat Liver—Mitochondria were prepared from livers of male Sprague-Dawley rats (220–250 g) fasted overnight. Livers from two rats were homogenized in 100 ml of isolation medium containing 230 mm mannitol, 70 mm sucrose, 2 mm EDTA, and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4 adjusted with KOH). The homogenate was centrifuged at 579 × gmax for 10 min to pellet the nucleus and unbroken cells. The supernatant from the previous step was centrifuged at 8000 × gmax for 10 min to pellet the mitochondria. The mitochondrial pellet was washed with 25 ml and then with 12.5 ml of isolation medium without EDTA. The final mitochondrial pellet was resuspended in the above medium to provide a protein concentration of 60 mg/ml. Mitochondrial protein concentration was determined by the BCA assay using bovine serum albumin as the standard (20Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18347) Google Scholar, 21Deleted in proofGoogle Scholar). Mitochondrial Incubation Medium—Unless otherwise specified, incubations of isolated mitochondria were conducted at 25 °C with 1 mg/ml protein in medium containing 250 mm sucrose, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4 adjusted with KOH), 10 mm succinate, 5 mm KH2PO4, and 2 μm rotenone. Deviations from this medium and other reagents employed are described in the figure legends. Mitochondrial Respiration—Oxygen consumption by mitochondria was measured in a chamber equipped with a Clark-type oxygen electrode (Instech Laboratories) under the conditions described under “Mitochondrial Incubation Medium.” Synthesis of Mitochondrially Targeted Ceramide Molecules—The mitochondrially targeted compounds consisted of the lipophilic cation pyridinium covalently linked to ceramide. These pyridinium-ceramides were prepared by N-acylation of d-erythro-sphingosine with ω-bromo acid chlorides following quaternization of pyridine with the formed ω-bromoceramides. The detailed synthesis of pyridinium-ceramides has been described. 2Szulc, Z. M., Gustilo, M., Mayroo, N. I. El-Zahwary, A., Bielawski, J., S.-Gracz, H., Hannun, Y. A., Obeid, L. M., and Bielawska, A. (2005) Bioorg.Med.Chem., manuscript in preparation. Measurement of Mitochondrial Permeabilization—Inner membrane permeabilization was assayed by measurements of Δψ and mitochondrial swelling and by changes in mitochondrial ultrastructure. Δψ was estimated from the accumulation of TPP+ in the mitochondrial matrix as described by Kamo et al. (22Kamo N. Muratsuga M. Hongoh R. Kobatake Y. J. Membr. Biol. 1979; 49: 105-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar). TPP+ (2 μm) was added to the incubation medium as indicated in the figure legends. Mitochondrial swelling was measured by changes in absorbance at 520 nm using a Brinkmann PC 900 probe colorimeter and fiberoptic probe. Changes in mitochondrial ultrastructure were examined by electron microscopy. Mitochondria were fixed with 3% glutaraldehyde for 15 min, followed by sedimentation and additional fixation overnight. The fixed mitochondria were washed three times with 0.1 m sodium cacodylate (pH 7.4), treated with 2% osmium tetroxide for 1 h, dehydrated through a graded ethanol series, and embedded in Embed 812 resin. Thin sections (70 nm) were stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate and subsequently examined using a Jeol/JEMI 1010 electron microscope. Cytochrome c Release from Mitochondria—Aliquots of mitochondrial suspension were taken as indicated in the figure legends and centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 3 min. The supernatant and mitochondrial pellet were frozen and stored at –20 °C. Cytochrome c in the supernatants and pellets was quantified using the Quantikine cytochrome c enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). Cell Culture—HepG2 cells (obtained from American Type Culture Collection) were cultured in Eagle's minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mml-glutamine, nonessential amino acids, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, and 1.5 g/liter sodium bicarbonate in humidified air (5% CO2) at 37 °C. For confocal microscopy, cells were plated onto poly-d-lysine-coated 35-mm glass bottom microwell dishes at a density of 20,000–25,000/cm2 and were grown for 2 days. MCF7 cells (obtained from American Type Culture Collection) were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 2 mm glutamine in humidified air (5% CO2) at 37 °C. All media were supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Isolation of Mitochondria from HepG2 Cells—For studies with mitochondria isolated from HepG2 cells, cells were cultured in the medium described under “Cell Culture” for 3 days in 75-cm2 flasks until 70% confluent. Cells were detached by treatment with 3 ml of 0.05% trypsin and 0.53 mm EDTA, diluted to 13 ml with incubation medium, and sedimented at 900 × g for 10 min. The pellet was washed with 1 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and cells were resuspended in 300 μl of isolation medium and then disrupted by 20 passages through a 28-gauge needle (½ inch). The homogenate was centrifuged at 900 × g for 10 min to pellet the nucleus and unbroken cells. The supernatant from the previous step was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min to pellet the mitochondria, which were then resuspended in incubation medium to provide a protein concentration of ∼10 mg/ml. Measurement of Cell Viability—HepG2 or MCF7 cells were plated at a density of 104 cells/well in 96-well plates in the medium described under “Cell Culture.” After 24 h of incubation, the cells were treated with ceramides for 46 h in 2% fetal bovine serum. Cell viability was determined by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (Sigma) following the manufacturer's instructions. Confocal Microscopy—Plated cells were washed once with serum-free medium and treated with 2 ml of 100 nm TMRM, 2 μm C6-pyridinium-DMAS-ceramide, or 2 μm C6-NBD-ceramide dissolved in the culture medium supplemented with 2% fetal bovine serum. After 30 min, unbound dyes were washed out, and images were collected using a Zeiss LSM 510 META system equipped with a krypton/argon laser and a ×63 oil objective (numerical aperture of 1.4). In parallel experiments, after initial loading of cells with TMRM or ceramides, cells were treated with uncoupling mixture (10 μm FCCP, 5 μg/ml antimycin A, and 10 μg/ml oligomycin A) for an additional 30 min to the discharge mitochondrial inner membrane potential. The TMRM images were collected by excitation at 543 nm and emission at 560 nm with a long path emission filter. The C6-pyridinium-DMAS-ceramide and C6-NBD-ceramide images were collected by excitation at 488 nm and emission at 505 nm with a long path emission filter. Analysis of Ceramides by Mass Spectroscopy—Accumulated ceramides in mitochondria were analyzed by mass spectroscopy using reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography couple with an electrospray triple quadruple mass spectrometer, operating at positive ionization in the multiple reaction monitoring mode. Mass separations were performed using a ThermoFinnigan TSQ 7000 mass spectrometer according to the methodology described by Bielawski et al. (45Bielawski J. Szulc Z.M. Hannun Y.A. Bielawska A. Methods. 2005; (in press)Google Scholar). Statistical Analysis—Standard curves and the data for cytochrome c release were computed by generation of a four-parameter logistic curve fit. The values for ceramide accumulation and cytochrome c release are expressed as the means ± S.E. Differences between data were analyzed for significance by Student's t test. The results were considered significant at p < 0.05. C6-pyridinium-ceramide Accumulates in Intact Cell Mitochondria in an Energy-dependent Manner—To determine whether whole cells will accumulate exogenous pyridinium-ceramides in the mitochondrial matrix, we used a fluorescent analog of C6-pyridinium-ceramide, C6-pyridinium-DMAS-ceramide. Fig. 2 shows the distribution pattern of C6-pyridinium-DMAS-ceramide (panels C and D) and the specific mitochondrial reporter TMRM (panels E and F), which is known to accumulate inside the mitochondrial matrix. Both C6-pyridinium-DMAS-ceramide- and TMRM-treated cells demonstrated a similar punctate pattern of staining, characteristic of mitochondria. Thus, C6-pyridinium-DMAS-ceramide accumulates selectively in mitochondria in living cells. Subsequent addition of the uncoupler FCCP in combination with inhibitors of the respiratory chain and ATPase (antimycin A and oligomycin, respectively) resulted in diffuse staining of the cytoplasm for both fluorophores, indicating that mitochondrial accumulation of C6-pyridinium-DMAS-ceramide in intact cells is indeed energy-dependent. In the presence of uncouplers, the diffuse staining of C6-pyridinium-DMAS-ceramide probably reflects equilibration of this molecule in cell membranes without specific concentration in any one compartment. In contrast to C6-pyridinium-DMAS-ceramide, cells treated with a fluorescent analog of neutral C6-ceramide, viz. C6-NBD-ceramide, developed prominent fluorescence in a perinuclear region (Fig. 2A), whereas mitochondrial staining was minimal. These results are consistent with several previous studies that have identified this compartment as the Golgi apparatus, and indeed, C6-NBD-ceramide has been accepted as a specific marker of this compartment (23Lipsky N.G. Pagano R.E. Science. 1985; 228: 745-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 24Pagano R.E. Sepanski M.A. Martin O.C. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 2067-2079Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Also, in agreement with previous observations that accumulation of C6-NBD-ceramide in the Golgi apparatus is energy-independent (24Pagano R.E. Sepanski M.A. Martin O.C. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 2067-2079Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), Fig. 2B demonstrates that uncouplers of oxidative phosphorylation did not affect staining of the perinuclear compartment by C6-NBD-ceramide. Taken together, these experiments provide evidence that exogenously added pyridinium-ceramide localizes preferentially to mitochondria and that its mitochondrial accumulation in situ is energy-dependent. To demonstrate definitively that C6-pyridinium-ceramide preferentially accumulates in mitochondria, HepG2 cells were treated with equal concentrations of C6-ceramide and C6-pyridinium-ceramide (3 μm) for 30 min; mitochondria were then isolated; and ceramide values were determined by mass spectroscopy. The amount of C6-pyridinium-ceramide in mitochondria was ∼7-fold higher compared with the amount of C6-ceramide (985 and 142 pmol/mg of protein, respectively). C6-pyridinium-ceramide Is a Potent Effector of Cell Viability—Next, we tested whether C6-pyridinium-ceramide is a more potent cell-killing agent compared with its uncharged analog. Indeed, C6-pyridinium-ceramide readily induced killing of hepatocarcinoma HepG2 cells (IC50 ∼ 8 μm) (Fig. 3A, trace 2), whereas electroneutral C6-ceramide was much less effective at the same range of concentrations (IC50 ∼ 31 μm) (trace 1). The effect of C6-pyridinium-ceramide is not unique for HepG2 cells. MCF7 breast cancer cells also responded to this compound (Fig. 3B). MCF7 cells appeared to be more sensitive to C6-ceramide compared with HepG2 cells (IC50 ∼ 16 μm) and demonstrated a considerable increase in sensitivity to C6-pyridinium-ceramide (IC50 ∼ 2 μm). Accumulation of C6-pyridinium-ceramide in Isolated Rat Liver Mitochondria Is Energy-dependent—Next, we set out to determine whether the accumulation of C6-pyridinium-ceramide by isolated mitochondria is energy-dependent. The addition of C6-pyridinium-ceramide (10 μm) to mitochondria resulted in 95% association with mitochondria (Fig. 4). Dissipation of mitochondrial Δψ by simultaneous addition of the complex III inhibitor antimycin A and the protonophore FCCP suppressed accumulation of C6-pyridinium-ceramide by 66.8% (Fig. 4). The difference in the amount of ceramide bound in the absence and presence of uncouplers of oxidative phosphorylation provides the amount of ceramide accumulated by mitochondria in an energy-dependent manner, whereas the component resistant to uncouplers indicates the ceramide that may be partitioned into the lipid phase of mitochondrial membranes or associated with nonspecific binding sites. Calculating the approximate mitochondrial matrix volume as 1.6 μl/mg of protein (25Petronilli V. Pietrobon D. Zoratti M. Azzone G.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 155: 423-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) and the Δψ-dependent uptake of pyridinium-ceramide as 6.28 nmol/mg of protein, the concentration of pyridinium-ceramide in the matrix space can reach 3.9 mm. On the other hand, the addition of uncharged C6-ceramide (10 μm) also resulted in its considerable association (79.3%) with mitochondria. The striking difference between the association of positively charged C6-pyridinium and electroneutral C6-ceramides is that the association of the latter is insensitive to dissipation of Δψ. Thus, the association of C6-ceramide with mitochondria is exclusively related to its partitioning into the lipid phase of mitochondria and/or its association with nonspecific mitochondrial binding sites. Therefore, C6-ceramide is evenly redistributed between the lipid phase of the inner and outer membranes with equal concentration of free ceramide in the intermembrane space and the matrix. In contrast, C6-pyridinium-ceramide is highly enriched in the inner membrane of energized mitochondria, and its free concentration in the matrix space is considerably elevated compared with that in the intermembrane space. C6-pyridinium-ceramide Is a Potent and Specific Inducer of Inner Mitochondrial Membrane Permeabilization—The results shown above suggest that, because of its greater accumulation in the mitochondrial matrix, C6-pyridinium-ceramide should affect mitochondrial function more potently compared with neutral ceramides. To this end, we compared the effects of C6-pyridinium-ceramide and its neutral derivative on permeability of the inner mitochondrial membrane for low molecular mass solutes. Respiring liver mitochondria, which contain ∼10–15 nmol of endogenous Ca2+/mg of protein, maintained accumulated TPP+, an index of Δψ, for >30 min (Fig. 5A, trace 1). Only slight decreases in the absorbance of the mitochondrial suspension (indicative of swelling) were observed under these conditions (Fig. 5B, trace 1), consistent with previous results on isolated mitochondria. The addition of 40 μm C6-pyridinium-ceramide induced a biphasic release of accumulated TPP+ (Fig. 5A, trace 2). The initial partial release of TPP+ was accomplished within 4 min and was followed by a slower phase of total TPP+ release reflecting complete dissipation of Δψ. This later phase was accompanied by a rapid decrease in absorbance, which indicates stimulation of large amplitude swelling caused by increased permeability of the inner membrane to the components of the incubation medium (Fig. 5B, trace 2). Indeed, the effects of C6-pyridinium-ceramide were very similar to those of the pore-forming peptide alamethicin, the addition of which to the mitochondrial suspension produced essentially the same light-scattering response as C6-pyridinium-ceramide (Fig. 5B, trace 3), suggesting that this ceramide enhances pore formation. Importantly, examination of mitochondrial ultrastructure by electron microscopy before (Fig. 6A) and 30 min (Fig. 6B) after the addition of C6-pyridinium-ceramide revealed the typical picture of large amplitude mitochondrial swelling, whereas in the absence of C6-pyridinium-ceramide, mitochondria remained in the aggregated configuration characterized by a shrunken matrix space and a large intracristal space (Fig. 6A). Incubation of mitochondria with C6-pyridinium-ceramide resulted in an extensive increase in matrix volume and unfolded cristae, characteristic of colloid/osmotic swelling (Fig. 6B). The inner membrane remained apparently intact, whereas the outer membrane was mostly ruptured and detached from the inner membrane. Thus, the results show that C6-pyridinium-ceramide exerts significant effects on isolated mitochondria, which are characterized by a relatively specific increase in permeability of the inner membrane. In contrast to C6-pyridinium-ceramide, which induced dissipation of Δψ (Fig. 5A, trace 2) as well as mitochondrial swelling (Fig. 5C, trace 1) with IC50 ∼ 27.5 μm, neutral C6-ceramide failed to induce dissipation of Δψ (Fig. 5A, trace 3) or mitochondrial permeabilization (Fig. 5, B, trace 3; and C, trace 2) at concentrations up to 60 μm. Structural Specificity of C6-pyridinium-ceramide Action—To verify that the effect of C6-pyridinium-ceramide is due to its acting as a ceramide analog, we compared its effect with the action of a number of structurally related and unrelated positively charged compounds. First, we determined the effect of the pyridinium moiety on mitochondrial permeabilization. To this end, the effects of short chain C2-pyridinium-ceramide and cetylpyridinium were evaluated. Fig. 5 (A, trace 4; and B, trace 4) shows that, employed at the same concentration as C6-pyridinium-ceramide (40 μm), C2-pyridinium-ceramide caused only minor changes in the magnitude of mitochondrial swelling and the value of Δψ compared with the control. Even employed at 60 μm (binding of 29.8 ± 1.4 nmol/mg of protein at 4 min) (Fig. 7A, trace 2), C2-pyridinium-ceramide failed to induce the same degree of swelling that was observed with 30 μm C6-pyridinium-ceramide (binding of 5 ± 0.8 nmol/mg of protein at 4 min) (Fig. 8A, trace 2).Fig. 8Time course (A) and dose-response curves (B) of the effect of C6-pyridium-ceramide versus C6-pyridinium-dihydroceramide on mitochondrial large amplitude swelling."
https://openalex.org/W2059931045,"We have determined the localization of the Golgi with respect to other organelles in living pancreatic acinar cells and the importance of this localization to the establishment of Ca2+ gradients over the Golgi. Using confocal microscopy and the Golgi-specific fluorescent probe 6-((N-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)amino)hexanoyl)sphingosine, we found Golgi structures localizing to the outer edge of the secretory granular region of individual acinar cells. We also assessed Golgi positioning in acinar cells located within intact pancreatic tissue using two-photon microscopy and found a similar localization. The mitochondria segregate the Golgi from lateral regions of the plasma membrane, the nucleus, and the basal part of the cytoplasm. The Golgi is therefore placed between the principal Ca2+ release sites in the apical region of the cell and the important Ca2+ sink formed by the peri-granular mitochondria. During acetylcholine-induced cytosolic Ca2+ signals in the apical region, large Ca2+ gradients form over the Golgi (decreasing from trans- to cis-Golgi). We further describe a novel, close interaction of the peri-granular mitochondria and the Golgi apparatus. The mitochondria and the Golgi structures form very close contacts, and these contacts remain stable over time. When the cell is forced to swell, the Golgi and mitochondria remain juxtaposed up to the point of cell lysis. The strategic position of the Golgi (closer to release sites than the bulk of the mitochondrial belt) makes this organelle receptive to local apical Ca2+ transients. In addition the Golgi is ideally placed to be preferentially supplied by ATP from adjacent mitochondria.

In this study we examined the localization of the Golgi with respect to other cellular organelles and the functional consequences of this localization. We found close Golgi-mitochondria contacts that remain remarkably stable over time and during different cellular perturbations. Finally, we visualized Ca2+ gradients that are formed over the Golgi as a consequence of relative positioning of the Golgi and mitochondria. Pancreatic Acinar Cell Preparation—Pancreata were obtained from male CD 1 mice (21–30 days old) as previously described (23Thorn P. Lawrie A.M. Smith P.M. Gallacher D.V. Petersen O.H. Cell. 1993; 74: 661-668Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar) in accordance with the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act, 1986. Undissociated tissue was immobilized and imaged as previously described (24Ashby M.C. Camello-Almarez C. Geras Petersen O.H. Tepikin A.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20860-20864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Single cells and clusters of acinar cells were obtained by brief (10-min) collagenase digestion of the pancreas, followed by gentle agitation with a pipette. For all experiments, isolated cells, pancreatic clusters, or pancreata were suspended in a standard HEPES-buffered physiological salt solution containing 140 mm NaCl, 4.7 mm KCL, 1.13 mm MgCl2,10 mm HEPES, 10 mm glucose, 1 mm CaCl2, pH adjusted to 7.2 (with NaOH). In studies of Ca2+ signaling, cells were stimulated by pressure application of acetylcholine (ACh) (see below). Confocal Microscopy—Live cells were examined on a Leica TCS SP2 or Leica SP2-AOBS confocal microscope with a 63× water immersion objective lens and a 1.2 NA. SGs were visualized using confocal reflectance (excitation, 543 nm; emission, 538–548 nm). To visualize the Golgi, cells were loaded with 2.5 μm NBD C6-ceramide for 15 min at 4 °C. NBD C6-ceramide was excited by a 476 nm laser line, and emission was collected at 500–550 nm. Cells were loaded with 50 nm MitoTracker Deep Red for 15 min at 37 °C to visualize mitochondria. MitoTracker Deep Red was excited with a 633 nm laser line, and emission was collected above 650 nm. For ER labeling, cells were incubated with 500 nm BODIPY Texas Red thapsigargin for 15 min at room temperature and excited at 594 nm, and the emission was collected between 600 and 650 nm. Images of intracellular organelles were obtained with a confocal pinhole corresponding to 1 Airy unit. The Ca2+ -sensitive indicator Fura Red was loaded into the cells in the membrane-permeant AM form (5 μm for 30 min at room temperature) and imaged using a 488 nm laser line for excitation and 570–650 nm for emission. Applications of agonists and analysis to calculate cytosolic Ca2+ gradients were performed as described by Gerasimenko et al. (25Gerasimenko O.V. Gerasimenko J.V. Petersen O.H. Tepikin A.V. Pflugers Arch. 1996; 432: 1055-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Briefly, ACh stimulation of pancreatic acinar cells was via a pipette filled with a 100 μm ACh solution. The pipette was attached to a pressure injection system (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany); this system allowed short (0.1–1-s) applications of ACh. In some experiments local Ca2+ signals were produced by stimulation with a low (10 nm) concentration of ACh. The formation of Ca2+ gradients across the cells axis with respect to the Golgi was analyzed in the following way: cells in which ACh elicited apically localized Ca2+ signal were selected for analysis. Line profiles of Fura Red fluorescence were taken across the cell from the apical to basolateral pole; the signal was then averaged for six such selected lines. The profile at rest was then subtracted from the stimulated profile (during peak of Ca2+ transient) giving rise to the ΔF (change in fluorescence) profile reflecting Ca2+ changes along the apical to basolateral axis. This trace was then compared with the distribution of NBD C6-ceramide fluorescence recorded along the same line. Chemicals—All fluorescent dyes were obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). All other chemicals were from Sigma. Localization of the Golgi and Its Interaction with the Perigranular Mitochondrial Belt—Labeling of the Golgi using the Golgi-specific probe NBD C6-ceramide (26Pagano R.E. Martin O.C. Kang H.C. Haugland R.P. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 1267-1279Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar) in live cells reveals a large crescent-shaped organelle also located in the peri-granular part of the cell (Fig. 1A, I and II; supplemental Fig. S1; supplemental Video 1). A similar localization of the Golgi has been described previously (using immunofluorescence labeling) in fixed isolated pancreatic acinar cells (27Shin D.M. Zhao X.S. Zeng W. Mozhayeva M. Muallem S. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 1101-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 28Thomas D.D.H. Weng N. Groblewski G.E. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 287: G253-G263Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Using two-photon microscopy, we also investigated the positioning of the Golgi in cells located within intact (undissociated) pancreatic tissue or large pancreatic clusters and found a clearly resolved crescent-shaped organelle located in the peri-granular region (see supplemental Fig. S1). We were able to disassemble this structure by incubating the cells for 30 min with brefeldin A (5 μg/ml; n = 42; see supplemental Fig. S2), a compound known to disassemble the Golgi (29Lippincott-Schwartz J. Yuan L.C. Bonifacino J.S. Klausner R.D. Cell. 1989; 56: 801-813Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1304) Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown a dense belt of mitochondria around the SGs in pancreatic acinar cells (18Tinel H. Cancela J.M. Mogami H. Gerasimenko J.V. Gerasimenko O.V. Tepikin A.V. Petersen O.H. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4999-5008Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 19Straub S.V. Giovannucci D.R. Yule D.I. J. Gen. Physiol. 2000; 116: 547-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 20Park M.K. Ashby M.C. Erdemli G. Petersen O.H. Tepikin A.V. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1863-1874Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 21Collins T.J. Bootman M.D. J. Exp. Biol. 2003; 206: 1993-2000Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 22Johnson P.R. Dolman N.J. Pope M. Vaillant C. Petersen O.H. Tepikin A.V. Erdemli G. Cell Tissue Res. 2003; 313: 37-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Positioning of the Golgi in this region suggested a possible overlap of the two organelles and prompted us to investigate their relative positioning. Co-labeling of acinar cells with NBD C6-ceramide (Fig. 1A, II) and MitoTracker Deep Red (Fig. 1A, III) shows that these two organelles are juxtaposed and sometimes interwoven (Fig. 1A, IV). The peri-granular mitochondrial belt is positioned predominantly on the basolateral side of the Golgi (Fig. 1A, IV, representative of 132 cells). Magnification of this part reveals that the Golgi (Fig. 1B, I) has close contacts with the mitochondria from the peri-granular belt (Fig. 1B, II and III). In the regions of contacts, the distance between these organelles is so small that it is beyond the resolution of confocal microscopy (Fig. 1B, III). Thus, the energy-dependent membrane trafficking steps from the ER to the Golgi and on through the Golgi stacks (1Palade G.E. Science. 1975; 189: 347-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (2313) Google Scholar) should be well served by the observed close proximity of the Golgi to the ATP-producing mitochondria. The membrane trafficking steps also depend on Ca2+ signals (4Porat A. Elazar Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29233-29237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) and Ca2+ gradients (5Ahluwalia J.P. Topp J.D. Weirather K. Zimmermann M. Stamnes M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34148-34155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Localization of the Golgi on the apical side of the mitochondrial belt could potentially expose the Golgi to frequent Ca2+ elevations induced in this cell type by physiological doses of secretagogues (Refs. 8Ashby M.C. Tepikin A.V. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 701-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 23Thorn P. Lawrie A.M. Smith P.M. Gallacher D.V. Petersen O.H. Cell. 1993; 74: 661-668Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar, and 30Kasai H. Li X.Y. Miyashita Y. Cell. 1993; 74: 669-677Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar; see also “The Golgi Localization and Cytosolic Ca2+ Gradients” below). Another interesting feature of Golgi and mitochondria positioning can be seen in a region adjacent to the apical part of the lateral plasma membrane. The white dashed line in Fig. 1C, I–IV, depicts the lateral membrane. It is clear that the mitochondria (Fig. 1C, III), but not the Golgi (Fig. 1C, II), extend up to the surface of the lateral membrane (Fig. 1C, IV and supplemental Video 2). These peri-granular mitochondria (Fig. 1C, III) extend past the edge of the Golgi (Fig. 1C, II–IV). Comparison of the distribution of the two organelles (Fig. 1) with the recently reported patterns of mitochondrial Ca2+ accumulation suggests that the lateral mitochondria not covered by the Golgi are the mitochondria that participate in the initial Ca2+ uptake (20Park M.K. Ashby M.C. Erdemli G. Petersen O.H. Tepikin A.V. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1863-1874Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). The region adjacent to the apical part of the lateral membrane was reported to contain Ca2+-releasing channels (reviewed in Ref. 31Kiselyov K. Shin D.M. Muallem S. Cell. Signal. 2003; 15: 243-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar); therefore, the lateral “Golgi-free” mitochondria could potentially be important participants in the signaling events generated in this part the cell. The Golgi-Mitochondria Complexes Are Stable Over Time and Resist Cell Perturbation—In many cell types mitochondria form a dynamic interconnected network (32Rizzuto R. Pinton P. Carrington W. Fay F.S. Fogarty K.E. Lishitz L.M. Tuft R.A. Pozzan T. Science. 1998; 280: 1763-1766Crossref PubMed Scopus (1748) Google Scholar, 33Skulachev V.P. Trends. Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 23-29Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). We used three-dimensional confocal reconstructions recorded over time to examine the stability of these close contacts formed between Golgi and mitochondria. Three-dimensional images of mitochondria and Golgi were recorded over time and analyzed. Despite small changes in cell shape and some dynamic movement of the two organelles, the regions in which they come into close contact remained stable over time (269 s) (Fig. 2, A and B, representative of 11 cells). No significant changes in Golgimitochondria contacts were seen during short (∼5-min) stimulation with supramaximal doses of secretagogues, 10 μm ACh (n = 13; supplemental Fig. S3), or 5 nm cholecystokinin (n = 4; data not shown). To further test the stability of Golgi-mitochondria contacts we induced artificial swelling of the cells by replacing the normal extracellular solution with distilled water (Fig. 2, C and D). The Golgi structures continued to be in close contact with mitochondria up to the point of cell lysis (Fig. 2D, III). At the time point immediately prior to lysis, the cell had swollen by 45 ± 7% (increase in the area of the central optical section; n = 7). During the cell expansion, up to the time of cell lysis, the Golgi and mitochondria moved simultaneously away from their initial location with regions of close contacts still present (n = 7). After cell lysis in distilled water, the mitochondria lost most of their staining, rounded up, and disconnected from the Golgi and other organelles (data not shown). Relative Positioning of Golgi and Other Organelles in Live Pancreatic Acinar Cells—Fig. 3 shows the relative positioning of intracellular organelles. Interestingly, in this cell type, the Golgi apparatus is not immediately adjacent to the nucleus (Fig. 3A). The mitochondria, which occupy a more basal location than the Golgi structures, create a narrow barrier between the Golgi and the nucleus (Fig. 3, A and C). The bulk of the ER is found basally with respect to the Golgi and the mitochondria (Fig. 3B); however, the thin projections of the ER described previously (17Gerasimenko O.V. Gerasimenko J.V. Rizzuto R.R. Treiman M. Tepikin A.V. Petersen O.H. Cell Calcium. 2002; 32: 261-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 34Park M.K. Petersen O.H. Tepikin A.V. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5729-5739Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) can be seen in the apical (with respect to Golgi) part of the cells (Fig. 3B). These ER projections account for the apical Ca2+ release from the lumenally connected ER (34Park M.K. Petersen O.H. Tepikin A.V. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5729-5739Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 35Mogami H. Nakano K. Tepikin A.V. Petersen O.H. Cell. 1997; 88: 49-55Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). The Golgi surrounds the SGs, whereas the peri-granular mitochondrial belt engulfs the Golgi (Fig. 3C) from both the basal and lateral sides. This dense layered packing results in the Golgi occupying a position in the vicinity of the SGs on the apical (with respect to the majority of the mitochondria) part of the cell (Fig. 3C). The Ca2+ released from the ER projections in the secretory granule area (Fig. 3B) should therefore first reach the Golgi before the bulk of the mitochondria can come into play and absorb this Ca2+ via high capacity mitochondrial uniporters (36Rizzuto R. Simpson A.W. Brini M. Pozzan T. Nature. 1992; 358: 325-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar, 37Hajnoczky G. Robb-Gaspers L.D. Seitz M.B. Thomas A.P. Cell. 1995; 82: 415-424Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (943) Google Scholar). We decided to verify this hypothesis by directly mapping Ca2+ gradients developed during localized apical Ca2+ signals with respect to the position of the Golgi. The Golgi Localization and Cytosolic Ca2+ Gradients—By co-loading NBD C6-ceramide and the Ca2+-sensitive dye Fura Red, we imaged apically restricted Ca2+ signals with respect to the Golgi localization (Fig. 4). The transmitted image of the cell cluster is shown in Fig. 4A. The apical (red circle) and basal (blue circle) regions of interest for Ca2+ measurements are shown in Fig. 4A, I. The line along which the Ca2+ gradient was plotted is also shown on the transmitted image (Fig. 4A, I). The Golgi staining can be seen on Fig. 4A, II. Fig. 4B shows an apically restricted Ca2+ signal generated by pressure application of ACh (orange arrow). The dotted lines represent the time periods used for the calculation of the Ca2+ gradient. The differences between resting and stimulated levels were calculated and are displayed in Fig. 4C, I (along the line crossing the Golgi), whereas the Golgi fluorescence profile measured along the same line is shown on Fig. 4C, II. By measuring the Ca2+ level along a line across the cell (Fig. 4A, II) before the stimulation and at the time points of maximal Ca2+ response, we could ascertain the Ca2+ gradients across the Golgi (n = 5). We found that during apical, physiologically relevant Ca2+ signaling (23Thorn P. Lawrie A.M. Smith P.M. Gallacher D.V. Petersen O.H. Cell. 1993; 74: 661-668Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar, 30Kasai H. Li X.Y. Miyashita Y. Cell. 1993; 74: 669-677Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar), the Golgi is exposed to Ca2+ gradients that dissipate 1–2 μm past the Golgi (Fig. 4C, II). For comparison, in separate experiments, we stained the Golgi and mitochondria (Fig. 4D) and drew similar line profiles as used in Fig. 4, A–C, to compare the localization of the Golgi and mitochondria (n = 10). The mitochondrial staining profile partially overlaps with the Golgi, but most of the mitochondrial staining was found within a 2-μm region past the Golgi. Uptake of Ca2+ by these mitochondria (20Park M.K. Ashby M.C. Erdemli G. Petersen O.H. Tepikin A.V. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1863-1874Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar) probably accounts for the dissipation of the Ca2+ gradient immediately past the Golgi. The notion that mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake plays a critical role in terminating local Ca2+ signals and formation of perigranular Ca2+ gradients is supported by our previous studies, in which inhibition of mitochondria with the protonophore carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone or an inhibitor of the electron transport chain antimycin (or a mixture of antimycin and oligomycin) resulted in conversion of local Ca2+ signaling to global Ca2+ responses (18Tinel H. Cancela J.M. Mogami H. Gerasimenko J.V. Gerasimenko O.V. Tepikin A.V. Petersen O.H. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4999-5008Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Straub et al. (19Straub S.V. Giovannucci D.R. Yule D.I. J. Gen. Physiol. 2000; 116: 547-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) reported that inhibition of mitochondria with carbonyl cyanide 4 trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone resulted in globalization of Ca2+ spikes induced by inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate uncaging. Similar results were obtained using Ru360, an inhibitor of the mitochondrial uniporter (38Johnson P.R. Tepikin A.V. Erdemli G. Cell Calcium. 2002; 32: 59-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Direct measurements of mitochondrial Ca2+ (20Park M.K. Ashby M.C. Erdemli G. Petersen O.H. Tepikin A.V. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1863-1874Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar) and indirect evidence (an increase in NADH during brief Ca2+ signals) (39Voronina S. Sukhomlin T. Johnson P.R. Erdemli G. Petersen O.H. Tepikin A.V. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2002; 539: 41-52Crossref Scopus (89) Google Scholar) also support the barrier role of mitochondria. In our current study we repeated experiments with inhibition of mitochondria by a mixture of rotenone and oligomycin (with additional staining for Golgi and visualization of mitochondria). We confirmed the previous results and were able to record the formation of global Ca2+ signals appearing in the apical, peri-granular, and basal regions almost simultaneously (supplemental Fig. S4, n = 4; an additional benefit of these experiments is that the position of the mitochondria is revealed by NADH autofluorescence, which is clearly seen to surround the Golgi). Because the Golgi is sandwiched between the Ca2+ source (release sites in the apical region) and the Ca2+ sink (mitochondrial uniporters), Ca2+ gradients are formed over this organelle with the Ca2+ concentration over the trans-Golgi higher than that over the cis-Golgi. Thus, in pancreatic acinar cells, the Golgi is regularly exposed to elevations in cytosolic Ca2+ and to steep Ca2+ gradients. If the Golgi were on the basolateral side of the peri-granular mitochondrial belt, it would not be exposed to Ca2+ gradients during local Ca2+ transients because the peri-granular mitochondrial belt would shield it from the Ca2+ elevations. By placing the high density of mitochondria behind (with respect to the site of Ca2+ signal generation) and not in front of the Golgi, this cell type has evolved to support Ca2+ signaling in the Golgi region. Mitochondria have also been shown to display barrier functions in other types of epithelial cells: in airway epithelia mitochondria create restricted Ca2+ signaling domains (40Ribeiro C.M.P. Paradiso A.M. Livraghi A. Boucher R.C. J. Gen. Physiol. 2003; 122: 377-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), whereas in parotid acinar cells mitochondria congregate around the nucleus, delaying nuclear Ca2+ entry and probably playing an important role in generation of ATP for nuclear processes (41Bruce J.E.I. Giovannucci D.R. Blinder G. Shuttleworth T.J. Yule D.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 12909-12917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Relative positioning of the Golgi with respect to such polarized mitochondrial groups could be a subject of an interesting comparative investigation. The relative positioning of the Golgi and mitochondria in pancreatic acinar cells creates additional functional polarity within the peri-granular mitochondrial belt. The trafficking steps from the transitional ER to the Golgi and through the Golgi compartments (1Palade G.E. Science. 1975; 189: 347-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (2313) Google Scholar) should be well served by ATP because of the close proximity of mitochondria to these traffic routes (Fig. 1). Analogous to the interactions seen in other cells between the ER and mitochondria (32Rizzuto R. Pinton P. Carrington W. Fay F.S. Fogarty K.E. Lishitz L.M. Tuft R.A. Pozzan T. Science. 1998; 280: 1763-1766Crossref PubMed Scopus (1748) Google Scholar, 42Csordas G. Hajnoczky G. Cell Calcium. 2001; 29: 249-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), close contacts between the Golgi and mitochondria could facilitate communication between these two organelles. It is important to note that mitochondria on the basal side of the mitochondrial belt in pancreatic acinar cells are surrounded by and in close proximity to ER strands (22Johnson P.R. Dolman N.J. Pope M. Vaillant C. Petersen O.H. Tepikin A.V. Erdemli G. Cell Tissue Res. 2003; 313: 37-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). One could suggest a concept of organelle-specific positioning of mitochondria: close contacts could be formed by mitochondria and other (different) cellular organelles requiring high local ATP supply; the physical nature of the contacts is probably specific for each target organelle. Lateral mitochondria are not covered by the Golgi (Fig. 1C) and are therefore exposed to Ca2+ signals generated locally in the apical part of the cell (20Park M.K. Ashby M.C. Erdemli G. Petersen O.H. Tepikin A.V. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1863-1874Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). The Golgi can also serve as a functional Ca2+-releasing store, containing inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors and two types of Ca2+ pumps (43Pinton P. Pozzan T. Rizzuto R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5298-5308Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar, 44Vanoevelen J. Raeymaekers L. Parys J.B. De Smedt H. Van Baelen K. Callewaert G. Wuytack F. Missiaen L. Cell Calcium. 2004; 35: 115-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The Golgi therefore has the potential not only to benefit from Ca2+ signals but also to shape these signals serving either as a Ca2+ sink or as the amplifier of the Ca2+ responses. The positioning of the Golgi in front of the mitochondrial barrier provides it with useful signaling commodities, Ca2+ elevations and gradients, which are required for secretory cargo processing (2Corbett E.F. Michalak M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 307-311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar) and vesicular trafficking (3Ivessa N.E. de-Lemos-Chiarandini C. Gravotto D.

In our previous study we found that the cytosolic Ca2+ gradients could reach hundreds of nanomoles per micrometer when measured along the line drawn from the apical to the basal part of the acinar cell (25Gerasimenko O.V.

Pflugers Arch. 1996; 432: 1055-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar); in the current work we found that these cytosolic Ca2+ signals cross the Golgi and dissipate within the peri-granular mitochondrial belt without spreading into the nucleus and the rest of the basal cytosol.

https://openalex.org/W2028189849,"Identification of tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) as the key agent in inflammatory disorders led to new therapies specifically targeting TNFα and avoiding many side effects of earlier anti-inflammatory drugs. However, because of the wide spectrum of systems affected by TNFα, drugs targeting TNFα have a potential risk of delaying wound healing, secondary infections, and cancer. Indeed, increased risks of tuberculosis and carcinogenesis have been reported as side effects after anti-TNFα therapy. TNFα regulates many processes (e.g. immune response, cell cycle, and apoptosis) through several signal transduction pathways that convey the TNFα signals to the nucleus. Hypothesizing that specific TNFα-dependent pathways control specific processes and that inhibition of a specific pathway may yield even more precisely targeted therapies, we used oligonucleotide microarrays and parthenolide, an NF-κB-specific inhibitor, to identify the NF-κB-dependent set of the TNFα-regulated genes in human epidermal keratinocytes. Expression of ∼40% of all TNFα-regulated genes depends on NF-κB; 17% are regulated early (1–4 h post-treatment), and 23% are regulated late (24–48 h). Cytokines and apoptosis-related and cornification proteins belong to the “early” NF-κB-dependent group, and antigen presentation proteins belong to the “late” group, whereas most cell cycle, RNA-processing, and metabolic enzymes are not NF-κB-dependent. Therefore, inflammation, immunomodulation, apoptosis, and differentiation are on the NF-κB pathway, and cell cycle, metabolism, and RNA processing are not. Most early genes contain consensus NF-κB binding sites in their promoter DNA and are, presumably, directly regulated by NF-κB, except, curiously, the cornification markers. Using siRNA silencing, we identified cFLIP/CFLAR as an essential NF-κB-dependent antiapoptotic gene. The results confirm our hypothesis, suggesting that inhibiting a specific TNFα-dependent signaling pathway may inhibit a specific TNFα-regulated process, leaving others unaffected. This could lead to more specific anti-inflammatory agents that are both more effective and safer.

Cell. Mol. Biol. (Noisy-le-grand). 2001; 47: 619-635PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, drugs targeting TNFα have been developed for inflammatory diseases, with expectations that these drugs would be more specific and avoid many side effects of the previous drugs, glucocorticoids and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (2Wolf R. Matz H. Orion E. Ruocco V. Clin. Dermatol. 2002; 20: 522-530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). However, the wide spectrum of processes affected by TNFα precludes our understanding and predicting fully the effects and side effects of the TNFα-targeted therapies. Overinhibiting the TNFα signals has a potential risk of delaying wound healing, secondary infections, and cancer; indeed, increased risks of tuberculosis and carcinogenesis have been reported as side effects after anti-TNFα therapy (3Antoni C. Braun J. Clin. Exp. Rheumatol. 2002; 20: S152-S157PubMed Google Scholar, 4Nahar I.K. Shojania K. Marra C.A. Alamgir A.H. Anis A.H. Ann. Pharmacother. 2003; 37: 1256-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). We believe that the dissection and comprehensive characterization of the pathways and genes regulated by TNFα will identify even more specific and finely tuned targets, which affect only a particular, defined subset of the TNFα-regulated genes. Inhibiting such could lead to anti-inflammatory treatments that are both more effective and safer. Therefore, we decided to dissect the epidermal responses to TNFα using pathway-specific profiling. Here, we identify the NF-κB-dependent TNFα-regulated genes in epidermal keratinocytes. The binding of TNFα to its receptor triggers a series of intracellular events, resulting in the activation of transcription factors, including NF-κB, CEBRβ and AP-1 (5Baud V. Karin M. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 372-377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1374) Google Scholar, 6Chen G. Goeddel D.V.

For example, NF-κB activation impedes TNFα-induced apoptosis, whereas AP1 activation does not (7Natoli G. Costanzo A. Guido F. Moretti F. Bernardo A. Burgio V.L. Agresti C. Levrero M. J. Biol.

Importantly, knock-out of IKKα has a severe cutaneous phenotype with incomplete epidermal differentiation, which suggests a fundamental role for NF-κB in skin (12Takeda K. Takeuchi O. Tsujimura T.

A knock-out of IKKβ is defective in signaling from TNFα to NF-κB, whereas deletion mutations of the IKKγ/NEMO account for most cases of incontinentia pigmenti, a dominantly inherited X-linked genodermatosis (14Li Z.W.

NF-κB is present in all epidermal layers but is nuclear only in the suprabasal ones, which further implicates NF-κB in epidermal differentiation (8Seitz C.S. Lin Q. Deng H. Khavari P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2307-2312Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). Constitutive activation of NF-κB in IκB-knock-out mice results in a widespread and lethal dermatitis in the first few days of life (16Klement J.F. Rice N.R. Car B.D. Abbondanzo S.J. Powers G.D.

Conversely, overexpression of IκB causes hyperplasia and inflammation and leads to squamous cell carcinomas (9van Hogerlinden M. Rozell B.L. Ahrlund-Richter L. Toftgard R.

Therefore, we decided to use pathway-specific transcriptional profiling and identify comprehensively the NF-κB-dependent, TNFα-regulated genes in epidermal keratinocytes. Many environmental stimuli, such as microbial infections, chemicals, and UV light, can activate the NF-κB pathways (17Pahl H.L. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6853-6866Crossref PubMed Scopus (3439) Google Scholar, 18Adachi M. Gazel A. Pintucci G. Shuck A. Shifteh S. Ginsburg D. Rao L.S. Kaneko T. Freedberg I.M. Tamaki K. Blumenberg M. Li D. Turi T.G. Schuck A. Khitrov G. DNA Cell Biol. 2003; 22: 665-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). We have recently characterized the complete spectrum of TNFα-regulated genes in the epidermis, using large DNA microarrays (19Banno T. Gazel A. Blumenberg M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 32633-32642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). To identify the NF-κB-dependent subset of TNFα-regulated genes, we used parthenolide, which specifically blocks the degradation of IκBα, resulting in immediate and persistent inhibition of activation of NF-κB, without affecting other pathways (20Hehner S.P. Hofmann T.G. Droge W. Schmitz M.L. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 5617-5623PubMed Google Scholar). We chose parthenolide, a pharmacologic agent, over genetic inhibitor (e.g. transfection with a dominant inhibitor of the pathway) to avoid the need for long term cultivation of keratinocytes in the absence of functional NF-κB, which could affect additional pathways (21Won Y.K. Ong C.N. Shi X. Shen H.M. Carcinogenesis. 2004; 25: 1449-1458Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Using pathway-specific gene expression profiling, we identified the NF-κB-dependent genes in normal human keratinocytes and revealed that NF-κB is responsible for innate immunity, inflammation, cytoskeletal organization, and cellular survival against apoptotic signals. Human Keratinocyte Cultures and Cytokine Treatment—Human neonatal foreskin epidermal keratinocytes were first grown in a defined growth medium, KGM, supplemented with 2.5 ng/ml epidermal growth factor and 0.05 mg/ml bovine pituitary extract (keratinocyte-SFM; Invitrogen), as described (22Li D. Turi T.G. Schuck A. Freedberg I.M. Khitrov G. Blumenberg M. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 2533-2535Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 23Banno T. Adachi M. Mukkamala L. Blumenberg M. Antivir. Ther. 2003; 8: 541-554PubMed Google Scholar). Third-passage keratinocytes were used at 50–70% confluence, at which point we switched to KBM, the same medium but unsupplemented. Keratinocytes were treated 24 h later with 50 ng/ml human recombinant TNFα (Sigma), 10 μm parthenolide (BIOMOL), or both. We first optimized the parthenolide concentration and found that the 20 μm level is lethal to the cells. 2T. Banno, A. Gazel, and M. Blumenberg, unpublished results. At each time point, we harvested the treated and a corresponding, matched, untreated control sample. Immunofluorescence and TUNEL Staining—Keratinocytes were grown on Lab-Tek chamber slides (Nunc) in KGM and then incubated in KBM 24 h before cytokine treatments. The cells were fixed with 70% methanol, rinsed with PBS, and incubated first with primary antibodies (rabbit polyclonal anti-NF-κB; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) in PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin and then with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled anti-IgG (Sigma). To detect apoptotic cells, we used the DeadEnd Fluorometric TUNEL System (Promega). Nuclei were counterstained with propidium iodide (Vector Laboratories). The stained cells were observed under the fluorescence microscopy (Zeiss, Axiophot), and images were captured with a digital photo camera (DKC-5000; Sony). For the quantitative determination of TUNEL-positive cells, for each experimental condition we selected 10 different medium power views at random and counted the total number of cells and the TUNEL-positive cells in each view. NF-κB Motif Binding Assay—We used 10 μg of cell extract in a TransAM NF-κB kit (Active Motif), which can measure the binding of activated NF-κB to its consensus sequence attached to a microwell plate, according to the manufacturer's instructions. Preparation of Labeled cRNA and GeneChip Hybridization—We isolated total RNA from the cells using RNeasy kits (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Approximately 5–8 μg of total RNA was reverse transcribed, amplified, and labeled as described (22Li D. Turi T.G. Schuck A. Freedberg I.M. Khitrov G. Blumenberg M. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 2533-2535Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 23Banno T. Adachi M. Mukkamala L. Blumenberg M. Antivir. Ther. 2003; 8: 541-554PubMed Google Scholar). Fifteen micrograms of labeled cRNA was hybridized to HGU95Av2 arrays (Affymetrix). Arrays were washed, stained with anti-biotin streptavidin-phycoerythin labeled antibody, and scanned using the Agilent GeneArray Scanner system (Hewlett-Packard). Array Data Analysis—We used the same data analysis approach for data extraction as before (19Banno T. Gazel A. Blumenberg M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 32633-32642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 22Li D. Turi T.G. Schuck A. Freedberg I.M. Khitrov G. Blumenberg M. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 2533-2535Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), including Microsuite 5.0 (Affymetrix). Differential expressions of transcripts were determined by calculating the -fold change. To compare data from multiple arrays, the signal of each probe array was scaled to the same target intensity value. Genes were considered regulated if the expression levels differed more than 2-fold relative to untreated control at any time point. To improve reliability, we checked individually the absolute expression levels and p values among all four time points. To reduce false positive regulated genes, we eliminated the genes that show a “zigzag” pattern of changes during the time course studied. To determine the NF-κB-dependent genes, we compared the values from the TNFα-treated and parthenolide + TNFα-treated cultures. We removed all genes deemed absent in the samples with a higher expression and eliminated duplications of the genes. The hierarchical clustering was performed using TIGR Multi-Experiment Viewer algorithms available on the World Wide Web at www.tigr.org/software/tm4 (24Saeed A.I. Sharov V. White J. Li J. Liang W. Bhagabati N. Braisted J. Klapa M. Currier T. Thiagarajan M. Sturn A. Snuffin M. Rezantsev A. Popov D. Ryltsov A. Kostukovich E. Borisovsky I. Liu Z. Vinsavich A. Trush V. Quackenbush J. BioTechniques. 2003; 34: 374-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (3996) Google Scholar). We developed an extensive gene annotation table describing the molecular function and biological category of the genes present on the chip, primarily based on data from J. M. Ruillard and the Gene Ontology Consortium Data (available on the World Wide Web at cgap.nci.nih.gov/Genes/GOBrowser and dot.ped.med.umich.edu:2000/ourimage/pub/shared/JMR_pub_affyannot.html). The genes were annotated according to this table. Identification of NF-κB Binding Sites in the Promoters of Regulated Genes—The upstream sequence for each gene was obtained from the HumanGenomeBrowser Gateway (available on the World Wide Web at genome.cse.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgGateway?org=human). We searched for a κB binding motif in the 2 kb upstream from the coding region, using MOTIF (available on the World Wide Web at motif.genome.ad.jp/) and TFSEARCH software (available on the World Wide Web at www.cbrc.jp/htbin/nph-tfsearch) with the cut-off threshold of 85%. We classified the identified sites into “perfect match” sequences identical to the κB consensus GGGRNNYYCC and into one nucleotide “mismatch” sequences. Real Time PCR—To confirm the microarray results, quantitative real time PCR was performed using LightCycler-RNA Amplification Kit SYBR Green I (Roche Applied Science). The PCR primers for each gene were designed using software (Roche Applied Science), with a target melting temperature at 60 °C. 300 ng of total RNA was applied for RT-PCR. The primers used for PCR analysis were as follows: EFNA1 (GAGGTGCGGGTTCTAC, GCTAGGTGATAGCTTATGCC), CEP4 (CCAGGCTTCGTGAATTG, GCGTTTAACTCAGCACTCT), SOX4 (GTCTTATGGCATGATGATAGC, ACACGGCATATTGCAC), NINJ1 (AACGTGAACCATTACGC, GTTGTTAAGGTCGTACTTGAC), SOD2 (GTTGGCCAAGGGAGATGTTA, CTGATTTGGACAAGCAGCAA), TNFαAIP (CCACAAACTTCGTGGA, CAATGAGGTGACGGGA), KRT15 (CTTGACATAAAGACACGGC, GGGGAATAGAGCGCAT), and GAPDH (GTCGGAGTCAACGGAT, CCACGACGTACTCAGC). The relative changes of gene expression were estimated and normalized to GAPDH by using the 2-ΔΔCT method (25Livak K.J. Schmittgen T.D. Methods. 2001; 25: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (123424) Google Scholar). siRNA—The 21-mer small interfering RNA duplexes (siRNA) with 3′ overhang dimers of uridine were synthesized using a Silencer siRNA Construction Kit, according to the manufacturer's instructions (Ambion). The oligonucleotide sequences were as follows: NF-κB1 (AAGATGATCCATATTTGGGAACCTGTCTC, AATTCCCAAATATGGATCATCCCTGTCTC) and cFLIP (AAGAAGCACTTGATACAGATGCCTGTCTC, AACATCTGTATCAAGTGCTTCCCTGTCTC). The transfection of siRNAs, 10 nm, was conducted using a liposome delivery system, 1.5 μl/ml siPORT Lipid (Ambion) in subconfluent keratinocytes. We treated keratinocytes with TNFα 48 h after siRNA and recorded the phenotypes 48 h after the TNFα treatment. Parthenolide Inhibits NF-κB Activation by TNFα in Keratinocytes—Activation of NF-κB by TNFα leads to its nuclear translocation and subsequent binding to the NF-κB sequence motifs in DNA; parthenolide blocks both processes in the TNFα-treated keratinocytes (Fig. 1, a and b). We expect, therefore, that the NF-κB-dependent genes will not be regulated by TNFα in the parthenolide-pretreated cells. Prevention of apoptosis is, arguably, the best known NF-κB-specific TNFα-regulated process (7Natoli G. Costanzo A. Guido F. Moretti F. Bernardo A. Burgio V.L. Agresti C. Levrero M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31262-31272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). To demonstrate this phenomenon in epidermal keratinocytes, we used the TUNEL assay. The TNFα treatment caused degenerative changes indicative of apoptosis in only a few cells; however, the inhibition of NF-κB with parthenolide caused massive cell death after the TNFα treatment (Fig. 1c). Parthenolide by itself does not affect the cell viability. Quantitative analysis of apoptotic cells confirmed these results (Fig. 1d). Thus, the activation of the NF-κB pathway prevents apoptosis in the TNFα-treated keratinocytes, presumably because of the antiapoptotic genes induced by the NF-κB-dependent pathway. Identification of the NF-κB-dependent TNFα-regulated Genes—In our previous work, we described 293 genes regulated by TNFα (19Banno T. Gazel A. Blumenberg M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 32633-32642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar); of these, 118 (40%) are NF-κB-dependent. Of the 118, 51 (17%) belong to the early genes (i.e. regulated 1–4 h after the TNFα treatment), whereas 67 (23%) are late, regulated 24 and 48 h post-treatment (Table I). To confirm the array results independently, we performed quantitative real time RT-PCR analysis of seven representative genes, six induced by TNFα and one suppressed; GAPDH, which is not regulated by TNFα, served as the control. To our satisfaction, all genes tested showed equivalent regulation in the two methods, microarrays and RT-PCR (Fig. 2).Table IList of NF-κB-dependent TNFα-regulated genes Open table in a new tab Statistical analysis of the functional categories shows a very specific, nonrandom segregation into early, late and NF-κB-independent categories (Table II). The most prominent among the early genes are the secreted proteins (i.e. chemokines, cytokines, and growth factors (Tables IA and II). Thus, signaling to the surrounding cells is one of the most important functions of the NF-κB-dependent responses to TNFα. NF-κB is known to play an essential role in innate immunity and the inflammatory host response in skin (26Pasparakis M. Courtois G. Hafner M. Schmidt-Supprian M. Nenci A. Toksoy A. Krampert M. Goebeler M. Gillitzer R. Israel A. Krieg T. Rajewsky K. Haase I. Nature. 2002; 417: 861-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). All nine of the TNFα-regulated chemokines are NF-κB-dependent, as are 10 of 11 of the genes associated with antigen presentation. These genes tend to have multiple NF-κB motifs, and the chemokine family genes tend to have the NF-κB binding motifs at short distances from the TATA box (Table II), which indicates direct transcriptional regulation by NF-κB. Moreover, the TNFα-induced gene expression of the chemokine gene family is very rapid but transient, also suggesting high dependence on direct transcriptional regulation.Table IIFunctional classification of the NF-κB-dependent genes Open table in a new tab Although the NF-κB pathway has been implicated in the differentiation of epidermal cells, IKK knock-outs having conspicuous epidermal phenotype (8Seitz C.S. Lin Q. Deng H. Khavari P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2307-2312Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar), little is known about the NF-κB-associated regulation of the epidermal differentiation genes. Curiously, although the induction of cornified envelope markers is an early NF-κB-dependent event (Table IA), we find that these genes lack the perfect NF-κB consensus motifs (Table II), which suggests a different regulatory mechanism of transcriptional regulation by NF-κB. Two secreted metalloproteases, MMP9 and MMP10 (gelatinase B and stomelysin-2), were also in the early NF-κB-dependent group, as were the transcription factors TNFAIP3, SOX4, and IRF1; these may be responsible, in part, for the indirect NF-κB-dependent late transcriptional effects. The late NF-κB-dependent genes comprise very different functional categories from the early ones (Table IA). Prominent among these are the antigen presentation-related proteins, components of the complement, CD58, and HLA markers. This implicates the NF-κB pathway in the immunomodulatory effects of TNFα. Extracellular matrix proteins collagen-XVI and chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan 4, which play roles in the attachment of keratinocytes to the basement membrane and in the cadherin-mediated adhesion (27Kassner A. Hansen U. Miosge N. Reinhardt D.P. Aigner T. Bruckner-Tuderman L. Bruckner P. Grassel S. Matrix Biol. 2003; 22: 131-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 28Legg J. Jensen U.B. Broad S. Leigh I. Watt F.M. Development. 2003; 130: 6049-6063Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), belong to the late genes, as does MMP13 (collagenase 3). Therefore, remodeling of the extracellular matrix and interaction with the neighboring cells seems to be an important component of the late NF-κB-dependent responses to TNFα. Confirming this, we find proteolysis inhibitors, adhesion and junctional proteins in this group as well. Interestingly, the late NF-κB-dependent group also contains MADH1 and MADHIP, which form a transcription factor complex and provide a nexus between the TNFα/NF-κB and the transforming growth factor β/SMAD signaling pathways. Several TNFα-suppressed genes were identified in the NF-κB-dependent group. However, using microarray approaches, we cannot determine with certainty the timing of their regulation, early versus late, because this depends on the mRNA degradation rates and other factors. Importantly, the TNFα-regulated cell cycle proteins are statistically overrepresented in the non-NF-κB-dependent category. TNFα inhibits keratinocyte proliferation and arrests the cells in G1 phase (19Banno T. Gazel A. Blumenberg M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 32633-32642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). The arrest seems to be wholly dependent on TNFα-regulated pathways other than NF-κB (Table II). Cell surface receptors and metabolic enzyme also belong to the TNFα-regulated genes that are independent from the NF-κB. Whereas most early genes are directly regulated by NF-κB, the late genes, in turn, may depend on the transcription factors regulated by the early genes. If so, we expect the promoters of the early genes to have more NF-κB binding sites than those of the late genes. Therefore, we used promoter analysis software to determine the presence of the NF-κB binding sequences in the 200-bp segments of the 2-kb sequences upstream from the coding region of each NF-κB-dependent gene (Table III). We calculated the average number of NF-κB sites per 200-bp interval and the S.D. of these numbers. The results indicate that only the promoter-proximal 200 bp of the early regulated genes have a statistically significant, greater than 2-S.D., increase in the number of the NF-κB motifs.Table IIIDistribution of NF-κB motifs in the promoters of regulated genesUpstream distance bpNumber of genes with NFκB sitesEarlyLate0/-20015*4-200/-40075-400/-60037-600/-80035-800/-100042-1000/-120032-1200/-140055-1400/-160023-1600/-180004-1800/-200004 Open table in a new tab Correlation of the NF-κB sites in the promoters with the functional analysis of the regulated genes indicates that the distribution of the NF-κB sites is not random (Table II). Chemokines and cytokines as a group have the highest accumulation of the NF-κB motifs, especially in the first 200 bp of their upstream sequences. Integrins and apoptosis-related proteins also have an overabundance of NF-κB sites. In contrast, keratins, cell cycle, and proteolysis genes generally lack NF-κB motifs. Curiously, although the induction of cornified envelope markers is NF-κB-dependent, we found that these genes lack the perfect NF-κB consensus motifs but contain single base mismatches; this suggests a different regulatory mechanism of their transcriptional regulation by NF-κB (Table II). Identification of cFLIP as an Essential NF-κB-dependent Antiapoptotic Gene—Prevention of apoptosis is, arguably, the best known NF-κB-specific TNFα-regulated process (7Natoli G. Costanzo A. Guido F.

In other systems, NF-κB was shown to regulate several genes encoding proteins with antiapoptotic properties, such as cFLIP, A20, cIAP, TRAF1, and Bcl-XL (29Wang C.Y. Mayo M.W. Korneluk R.G.

Schneider P. Irmler M. Thome M. Froelich C.J. Tschopp J. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 3936-3942PubMed Google Scholar). A caveat in such conclusions is the fact that some genes have multiple, interacting functions. For example, TNFAIP3 and SOX4 are transcription factors with imputed antiapoptotic roles (32He K.L.

https://openalex.org/W2083977776,"Histone acetylation plays an important role in chromatin remodeling and gene expression. The molecular mechanisms involved in cell-specific expression of endothelial nitric-oxide synthase (eNOS) are not fully understood. In this study we investigated whether histone deacetylation was involved in repression of eNOS expression in non-endothelial cells. Induction of eNOS expression by histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors trichostatin A (TSA) and sodium butyrate was observed in all four different types of non-endothelial cells examined. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed that the induction of eNOS expression by TSA was accompanied by a remarkable increase of acetylation of histone H3 associated with the eNOS 5′-flanking region in the non-endothelial cells. Moreover, DNA methylation-mediated repression of eNOS promoter activity was partially reversed by TSA treatment, and combined treatment of TSA and 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine (AzadC) synergistically induced eNOS expression in non-endothelial cells. The proximal Sp1 site is critical for basal activity of eNOS promoter. The induction of eNOS by inhibition of HDACs in non-endothelial cells, however, appeared not mediated by the changes in Sp1 DNA binding activity. We further showed that Sp1 bound to the endogenous eNOS promoter and associated with HDAC1 in non-endothelial HeLa cells. Combined TSA and AzadC treatment increased Sp1 binding to the endogenous eNOS promoter but decreased the association between HDAC1 and Sp1 in HeLa cells. Our data suggest that HDAC1 plays a critical role in eNOS repression, and the proximal Sp1 site may serve a key target for HDCA1-mediated eNOS repression in non-endothelial cells."
https://openalex.org/W2171416397,"Microsomal prostaglandin E synthase (mPGES)-1 is one of several prostaglandin E synthases involved in prostaglandin H2 (PGH2) metabolism. In the present report, we characterize the contribution of mPGES-1 to cellular PGH2 metabolism in murine macrophages by studying the synthesis of eicosanoids and expression of eicosanoid metabolism enzymes in wild type and mPGES-1-deficient macrophages. Thioglycollate-elicited macrophages isolated from mPGES-1–/– animals and genetically matched wild type controls were stimulated with diverse pro-inflammatory stimuli. Prostaglandins were released in the following order of decreasing abundance from wild type macrophages stimulated with lipopolysaccharide: prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) > thromboxane B2 (TxB2) > 6-keto prostaglandin F1α (PGF1α), prostaglandin F2α (PGF2α), and prostaglandin D2 (PGD2). In contrast, we detected in mPGES-1–/– macrophages a >95% reduction in PGE2 production resulting in the following altered prostaglandin profile: TxB2 > 6-keto PGF1α and PGF2α > PGE2, despite the comparable release of total prostaglandins. No significant change in expression pattern of key prostaglandin-synthesizing enzymes was detected between the genotypes. We then further profiled genotype-related differences in the eicosanoid profile using macrophages pre-stimulated with lipopolysaccharide followed by a 10-min incubation with 10 μm [3H]arachidonic acid. Eicosanoid products were subsequently identified by reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography. The dramatic reduction in [3H]PGE2 formation from mPGES-1–/– macrophages compared with controls resulted in TxB2 and 6-keto PGF1α becoming the two most abundant prostaglandins in these samples. Our results also suggest a 5-fold increase in 12-[3H]hydroxyheptadecatrienoic acid release in mPGES-1–/– samples. Our data support the hypothesis that mPGES-1 induction in response to an inflammatory stimulus is essential for PGE2 synthesis. The redirection of prostaglandin production in mPGES-1–/– cells provides novel insights into how a cell processes the unstable endoperoxide PGH2 during the inactivation of a major metabolic outlet. Microsomal prostaglandin E synthase (mPGES)-1 is one of several prostaglandin E synthases involved in prostaglandin H2 (PGH2) metabolism.

In contrast, we detected in mPGES-1–/– macrophages a >95% reduction in PGE2 production resulting in the following altered prostaglandin profile: TxB2 > 6-keto PGF1α and PGF2α > PGE2, despite the comparable release of total prostaglandins. No significant change in expression pattern of key prostaglandin-synthesizing enzymes was detected between the genotypes. We then further profiled genotype-related differences in the eicosanoid profile using macrophages pre-stimulated with lipopolysaccharide followed by a 10-min incubation with 10 μm [3H]arachidonic acid. Eicosanoid products were subsequently identified by reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography. The dramatic reduction in [3H]PGE2 formation from mPGES-1–/– macrophages compared with controls resulted in TxB2 and 6-keto PGF1α becoming the two most abundant prostaglandins in these samples. Our results also suggest a 5-fold increase in 12-[3H]hydroxyheptadecatrienoic acid release in mPGES-1–/– samples. Our data support the hypothesis that mPGES-1 induction in response to an inflammatory stimulus is essential for PGE2 synthesis. The redirection of prostaglandin production in mPGES-1–/– cells provides novel insights into how a cell processes the unstable endoperoxide PGH2 during the inactivation of a major metabolic outlet. Modulation of prostaglandin metabolism is at the center of current anti-inflammatory therapies. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and aspirin-related drugs block the activity of cyclooxygenases and their ability to convert arachidonic acid (AA) 1The abbreviations used are: AA, arachidonic acid; mPGES, microsomal prostaglandin E synthase; PGE2, prostaglandin E2; PGH2, prostaglandin H2; PGF1α, prostaglandin F1α; PGF2α, prostaglandin F2α; PGD2, prostaglandin D2; PGI2, prostaglandin I2; TxB2, thromboxane B2; TxA2, thromboxane A2; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; Cox, cyclooxygenase; TxAS, thromboxane synthase; EIA, enzyme immunoassay; PGIS, prostaglandin I synthase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; HHT, 12-hydroxyheptadecatrienoic acid. into PGH2. PGH2 can be subsequently metabolized by terminal prostaglandin synthases to the corresponding biologically active PGs, namely, PGI2, thromboxane A2, PGD2, PGF2α, and PGE2. A combination of pharmacological, genetic, and neutralizing antibody approaches demonstrates the importance of PGE2 in inflammation (1Portanova J.P. Zhang Y. Anderson G.D. Hauser S.D. Masferrer J.L.

In many respects, disruption of PGE2-dependent signaling in animal models of inflammation can be as effective as treatment with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or Cox-2 inhibitors (1Portanova J.P.

The conversion of PGH2 to PGE2 may therefore represent a pivotal step in the propagation of inflammatory stimuli. Several prostaglandin E synthases, the enzymes that convert PGH2 into PGE2, have been isolated and identified to date (7Ogino N. Miyamoto T. Yamamoto S. Hayaishi O. J. Biol.

Importantly, mPGES-1–/– mice in a chronic model of inflammation, collagen-induced arthritis, are mostly resistant to the development of joint arthritis (3Trebino C.E. Stock J.L. Gibbons C.P.

The marked reduction in chronic inflammation is accompanied at the cellular level by a >95% reduction in LPS-induced PGE2 release from mPGES-1–/– peritoneal macrophages (3Trebino C.E. Stock J.L.

PGH2 serves as a common substrate for multiple prostaglandin synthases, and it is therefore conceivable that the modulation of one arm of the pathway may impact substrate availability for other terminal prostaglandin synthases. For example, prostaglandin I synthase (PGIS)-deficient mice lose a significant in vivo portion of their prostacyclin production ability, and this is accompanied by marked increases in systemic PGE2 and TxB2 production (25Yokoyama C. Yabuki T. Shimonishi M. Wada M. Hatae T. Ohkawara S. Takeda J. Kinoshita T. Okabe M. Tanabe T. Circulation. 2002; 106: 2397-2403Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). It is difficult to conclude, especially in view of the developmental vascular disorders observed in PGIS-deficient animals, that these results were not the reflection of complex physiological adaptation secondary to genetic compensation. However, these studies do provide preliminary indication that in the absence of a major terminal prostanoid synthase, divergence of flow to other prostanoids can occur. Our studies were designed to test this hypothesis in mPGES-1-deficient macrophages. Macrophages are key determinants of disease processes involved in the initiation, progression, and resolution of inflammation. These cells process external inflammatory cues and in turn propagate physiological responses via the release of inflammatory mediators such as PGE2, PGD2, PGI2, PGF2α, and TxA2 (26Lazarus M.

Immunol. 1998; 160: 2974-2982PubMed Google Scholar). The orchestrated synthesis of these prostaglandins is an important aspect of inflammation because each of these mediators displays unique and sometimes opposing cellular functions (29Meja K.K. Barnes P.J. Giembycz M.A. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 122: 149-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 30Gilroy D.W. Colville-Nash P.R. Willis D. Chiver J. Paul-Clark M.J. Willoughby D.A. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 698-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (1120) Google Scholar). Therefore, macrophages provide a cellular model for characterizing prostaglandin metabolism. We posited that the absence of mPGES-1 expression in macrophages would be accompanied by marked “PGH2 shunting” to prostaglandins other than PGE2. To test this hypothesis, murine macrophages isolated from wild type and littermate mPGES-1-deficient animals were exposed to diverse pharmacological inhibitors and/or pro-inflammatory stimuli. Detailed expression analyses of mPGES-1+/+ and mPGES-1–/– cells revealed no overt difference in levels of prostaglandin metabolic enzymes. Furthermore, there was no detectable retrograde effect of mPGES-1 deletion on leukotriene levels. However, in the absence of mPGES-1 expression, our results suggest that PGH2 metabolism can be diverted to biologically active prostaglandins other than PGE2, suggesting that the mPGES-1 enzyme is a primary release mechanism of PGH2 accumulation. Isolation of Macrophages—mPGES-1–/– and control mPGES-1+/+ mice were generated as previously described (3Trebino C.E. Stock J.L. Gibbons C.P. Naiman B.N. Wachtmann T.S. Umland J.P. Pandher K. Lapointe J-M. Saha S. Roach M.L. Carter D. Thomas N.A. Durtschi B.A. McNeish J.D. Hambor J.E. Jakobsson P.-J. Carty T.J. Perez J.R. Audoly L.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 9044-9049Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). All animals used in our studies were on an inbred DBA/1lacJ genetic background. All experiments were performed under protocols approved by the Pfizer Global Research and Development Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees. Mice received intraperitoneal injection with 0.5 ml of 10% thioglycollate media on day 0. On day 4, peritoneal lavages were then collected and processed as previously described (2McCoy J.M. Wicks J.R. Audoly L.P. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 110: 651-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). No significant difference in the number of cells recovered from peritoneal exudates was noted between genotypes. Cellular Prostaglandin Formation Assays—Four different types of cellular experiments were performed with the peritoneal macrophages isolated from mPGES-1–/– and mPGES-1+/+ mice. At the completion of each experiment, supernatants were isolated and stored at –80 °C until assayed. Media controls for each condition reflected the highest possible amount of solvent used to prepare the corresponding stimulating agent (LPS: PBS, arachidonic acid: ethanol, dazoxiben: Me2SO). For the prostaglandin measurement time course experiments, macrophages (105 cells/well in a 96-well plate format) were incubated with 1 μg/ml LPS (Escherichia coli 0111:B4) for the corresponding incubation period, and supernatants were then removed and discarded. Cells were then washed three times with PBS and incubated for 1 additional hour in the presence of fresh cell culture media. For the prostaglandin accumulation experiments, macrophages (107 cells/dish in a 100-mm dish) were incubated without or with 1 μg/ml LPS (E. coli 0111:B4) for 16 h. For the AA post-stimulation experiments, macrophages (105 cells/well in a 96 well-plate format) were pre-treated with LPS for 16 h, followed by incubation with 10 μm arachidonic acid for increasing periods of time (up to 60 min). For the thromboxane synthase (TxAS) inhibitor studies (dazoxiben), cells (105 cells/well in a 96 well-plate format) were pre-treated with LPS (16-h incubation), followed by a 15-min pre-incubation with increasing concentrations of dazoxiben and subsequent treatment with 10 μm AA for 10 min. Microsomal Preparation and Western Blot Analyses—Macrophages growing in a 10-cm culture dish (107 cells/dish) were processed, and immunodetections of microsomal proteins were performed as described previously (22Sweeney F.J. Wachtmann T.S. Eskra J.D. Verdries K.A. Lambalot R.H. Carty T.J. Perez J.R. Audoly L.P. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2003; 205: 151-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The following antibodies were used for immunodetection of prostaglandin synthetic enzymes: mPGES-1, rabbit polyclonal antibody (1:500; Cayman Chemicals, Ann Arbor, MI); Cox-2, rabbit polyclonal antibody (1:3000; Abcam, Cambridge, UK); PGIS, mouse monoclonal antibody (1:30; Oxford Biomedical Research, Oxford, MI); and TxAS, rabbit polyclonal antibody (1:500; Cayman Chemicals). Eicosanoid Analysis (Non-radioactive Measurements)—Non-radioactive media were assayed for PGE2, 6-keto PGF1α (a stable metabolite of PGI2), TxB2 (a stable metabolite of TxA2), PGF2α, and PGD2 by EIA according to the manufacturer's protocol (Cayman Chemicals). The lower limit of detection by EIA was 15 pg/ml. Radiolabeled Eicosanoid Analysis—Mouse peritoneal macrophages were added to 24-well culture dishes at a concentration of 106 cells/well in 1 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium + 1% fetal bovine serum. After attaching for 4 h, 1 μg/ml LPS was added, and the cells were incubated for 20 h. Cells were washed first with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (no fetal bovine serum), and 0.5 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10 μm arachidonic acid and 1 μCi of [3H]arachidonic acid was subsequently added for a period of 5 min at 37 °C. The media were removed and found to contain 33% of the added radioactivity. Solid phase extraction of the media was then performed. Acetonitrile (500 μl) containing a mixture of eicosanoid standards: 1 μg each of 6-keto PGF1α, TxB2, PGF2α, PGE2, and PGD2; 50 ng each of LTD4, LTC4, LTB4, and HHT; and 100 ng of indomethacin was added to 250 μl of media in a 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube. After centrifugation at 8000 × g for 2 min, the supernatant was transferred to a 13 × 100-mm borosilicate glass tube. After dilution with 3.5 ml of 5 mm phosphoric acid in water, the supernatant was then passed through a 100-mg Bond Elut C18 column (Varian Inc., Palo Alto, CA) previously wetted with 4 ml of methanol followed by 2 × 1 ml of acetonitrile and 1 ml of water. The tube and column were then washed with 1 ml of acetonitrile/water/phosphoric acid/triethylamine (10:90:0.036:0.036, v/v/v/v) and eluted with 0.5 ml of solvent acetonitrile/water/phosphoric acid/triethylamine (70:30:0.036:0.036, v/v/v/v) followed by 0.5 ml of acetonitrile/water/phosphoric acid/triethylamine (10:90:0.036:0.036, v/v/v/v), resulting in a final 1.0-ml eluate in acetonitrile/water/phosphoric acid/triethylamine (35:65:0.036:0.036, v/v/v/v). HPLC separation was then performed using a Waters Symmetry C8 HPLC column (3.0 × 0.46 cm) (Waters, Milford, MA). The entire 1 ml of solid phase extraction eluate was injected using a Gilson ASPEC autosampler programmed to dilute and mix the sample with 4.1 ml of water containing 5 mm phosphoric acid and injecting 5.0 ml using a 5.0-ml sample loop into the column equilibrated with acetonitrile/water/phosphoric acid/triethylamine (10:90:0.036:0.036, v/v/v/v) at a flow rate of 1.5 ml/min. A linear gradient to acetonitrile/water/phosphoric acid/triethylamine (60:40:0.036:0.036, v/v/v/v) over 20 min at a flow rate of 1.5 ml/min was used to elute the eicosanoids. The eluate was monitored with 2 PerkinElmer Life Sciences Series 200 absorbance detectors set at 195 and 280 nm. The percentage recovery of the spiked standards showed 94 ± 3% recovery of prostanoid standards and 76 ± 5% recovery of the HHT standards. Fractions (0.15 min) were collected from 10.00 to 25.00 min. For radiolabeled product profiles, 150 of 225 μl of each fraction was counted in 4.0 ml of Beckman Redisafe scintillation fluid, and the mixture was counted using a Beckman LS6500 scintillation counter. Materials—Unless indicated otherwise, all reagents were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Statistical Analysis—The values are expressed as the mean ± S.E. Group comparisons were performed by analysis of variance with a Bonferroni post-test unless otherwise noted. Production of PGE2 in Macrophages—Incubation of wild type peritoneal macrophages with LPS caused a substantial increase in the release of PGE2 into the cellular supernatant starting after 4 h, lasting over the course of 48 h, and reaching a plateau at the 24 h time point (Fig. 1). In marked contrast, mPGES-1–/– cells showed no significant increase in PGE2 formation at all time points. Evidence of Prostaglandin Shunting in mPGES-1–/– Macrophages after Prolonged LPS Challenge—Based on the time course of PGE2 formation, we chose to further profile prostaglandin formation 16 h after LPS incubation. Cellular supernatants were isolated and assayed for PGE2, 6-keto PGF1α (a stable metabolite of PGI2), TxB2 (a stable metabolite of TxA2), PGF2α, and PGD2 production. No significant difference was detected between mPGES-1+/+ and mPGES-1–/– samples from cells treated with vehicle only (Fig. 2). In contrast, incubation with LPS caused a significant increase in all prostanoids measured in the supernatants isolated from wild type cells. Consistent with our time course experiments, PGE2 levels were reduced by ∼95% in media isolated from LPS-treated mPGES-1–/– cells. Furthermore, TxB2 became the most prominent prostaglandin formed in mPGES-1–/– samples. The relative order of prostaglandin abundance in mPGES-1–/– samples was as follows: TxB2 > 6-keto PGF1α > PGF2α > PGD2 > PGE2. In contrast, this ranking in mPGES-1+/+ samples was as follows: PGE2 > TxB2 > 6-keto PGF1α > PGF2α > PGD2. We detected an ∼2-fold increase in the levels of TxB2, 6-keto PGF1α, PGF2α, and PGD2 in mPGES-1–/– supernatants relative to mPGES-1+/+ samples (Table I). To characterize the molecular mechanisms responsible for this altered pattern of expression, we focused on the expression of the terminal prostaglandin synthases and cyclooxygenases isoforms responsible for the formation of the most abundant prostaglandin.Table IProstaglandin profiles from mPGES-1+/+ and mPGES-1-/- macrophages incubated overnight with LPSProstanoidFold increase% Total PGmPGES-1-/-: mPGES-1+/+mPGES-1+/+mPGES-1-/-PGE2633TxB22.622636-Keto PGF1α2.7514PGD21.7612PGF2α1.647 Open table in a new tab Induction Kinetics of Prostaglandin Synthetic Enzymes—To begin to address the mechanisms that could have led to this diversion of prostaglandin flow, we profiled the induction kinetics of Cox-2, mPGES-1, PGIS, and TxAS by Western blot. All four proteins were detected at t = 0 h. Genetic ablation of the mPGES-1 gene resulted in a significant down-regulation of detectable mPGES-1 protein expression (Fig. 3A). Importantly, the absence of detectable mPGES-1 expression did not result in significant overt modulation of either Cox-2, PGIS, or TxAS protein levels as determined by densitometry (Fig. 3B; data not shown for PGIS and TxAS). Treatment of macrophages with either vehicle or LPS did not have a significant impact on TxAS or PGIS protein levels in either mPGES-1+/+ or mPGES-1–/– samples. In contrast, expression of mPGES-1 and Cox-2 in mPGES-1+/+ samples was up-regulated several fold above baseline levels at multiple time points following LPS incubation (Fig. 3B). The pattern of Cox-2 protein expression did not differ significantly between mPGES-1+/+ and mPGES-1–/– cells, consistent with the absence of detectable genetic compensation at the protein expression level (Fig. 3B). Whereas both mPGES-1 and Cox-2 are modulated in response to an inflammatory stimulus, their relative patterns of expression differ markedly. Peak expression of Cox-2 protein occurs at 8 h after LPS challenge and returns to baseline by 24 h. In contrast, mPGES-1 protein expression follows a biphasic pattern, reaching an intermediate plateau at 8 h and a sustained peak at 24 h. The 48 h time point typifies the distinct pattern of expression of these two proteins: at this time point, mPGES-1 is maximally up-regulated (relative to the time course of this experiment), and Cox-2 levels have returned back to baseline. Kinetics of Prostaglandin Formation during an Acute Challenge—LPS challenge experiments suggest that murine macrophages divert their prostaglandin production to PGI2 and TxA2 (and, to a lesser extent, PGD2 and PGF2α) in the absence of mPGES-1 expression. To further examine the role of mPGES-1 in acute inflammatory settings, LPS-stimulated cells were exposed to 10 μm AA from 30 s to 60 min. The first 10 min of AA challenge were associated with the highest rate of prostanoid production (Fig. 4). Consistent with our previous results, PGE2 production in mPGES-1–/– samples was significantly reduced compared with wild type samples (Fig. 4A). Both mPGES-1–/– and mPGES-1+/+ samples produced significant quantities of TxB2 and 6-keto PGF1α (Fig. 4, B and C) within the first 10 min of AA challenge. Greater amounts of both of these prostaglandins were detected in mPGES-1–/– samples, but both reached maximum amounts 10 min post-challenge. To further profile the impact of mPGES-1 deletion on eicosanoid metabolism, radiolabeling studies were performed using a 15-min [3H]AA incubation preceded by overnight treatment with LPS. The elution profile clearly showed the reduction in PGE2 production accompanied by elevations in other prostaglandins, 6-keto PGF1α, TxB2, and PGF2α (Fig. 5, A and B). Leukotriene levels were not overtly altered in mPGES-1–/– samples. Our results suggest that a compound that co-elutes with HHT was increased in mPGES-1–/– samples by ∼5-fold relative to wild type samples. These results clearly indicate that the absence of mPGES-1 can be accompanied by metabolic shunting toward prostaglandins other than PGE2, and possibly HHT, at the cellular level. Shunting of Prostaglandin Formation after Pharmacological Inhibition of a Terminal Prostaglandin Synthase—To establish the relevance of our findings following genetic manipulation of the prostaglandin pathway, we tested the effects of a pharmacological inhibitor on prostaglandin shunting. Wild type and mPGES-1–/– macrophages treated with increasing concentrations of the thromboxane synthase inhibitor, dazoxiben, were exposed to 10 μm arachidonic acid following overnight incubation with LPS. The IC50 values were similar for cells of either genotype, although the absolute TxB2 levels were higher in mPGES-1–/– samples compared with mPGES-1+/+ samples (Fig. 6A). TxAS inhibition caused a corresponding increase in PGE2 levels (Fig. 6B). The inflection points for the TxB2 and PGE2 curves were 1 and 0.1 μm, respectively. These results suggest that either pharmacological inhibition or genetic manipulation can produce diversion of prostaglandin metabolism in our experimental system. Stimulation of murine macrophages with LPS or a combination of LPS and AA causes a marked increased in prostaglandins released into the extracellular medium, with PGE2 being the most abundant prostaglandin.

In embryos, alterations of the normal pattern of Hox gene expression result in homeotic transformations and malformations. Disruption of the Hoxa1 gene, the most 3′ member of the Hoxa cluster and a retinoic acid (RA) direct target gene, results in abnormal ossification of the skull, hindbrain, and inner ear deficiencies, and neonatal death. We have generated Hoxa1-/- embryonic stem (ES) cells (named Hoxa1-15) from Hoxa1-/- mutant blastocysts to study the Hoxa1 signaling pathway. We have characterized in detail these Hoxa1-/- ES cells by performing microarray analyses, and by this technique we have identified a number of putative Hoxa-1 target genes, including genes involved in bone development (e.g. Col1a1, Postn/Osf2, and the bone sialoprotein gene or BSP), genes that are expressed in the developing brain (e.g. Nnat, Wnt3a, BDNF, RhoB, and Gbx2), and genes involved in various cellular processes (e.g. M-RAS, Sox17, Cdkn2b, LamA1, Col4a1, Foxa2, Foxq1, Klf5, and Igf2). Cell proliferation assays and Northern blot analyses of a number of ES cell markers (e.g. Rex1, Oct3/4, Fgf4, and Bmp4) suggest that the Hoxa1 protein plays a role in the inhibition of cell proliferation by RA in ES cells. Additionally, Hoxa1-/- ES cells express high levels of various endodermal markers, including Gata4 and Dab2, and express much less Fgf5 after leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) withdrawal. Finally, we propose a model in which the Hoxa1 protein mediates repression of endodermal differentiation while promoting expression of ectodermal and mesodermal characteristics.

In mammals, 39 of the Hox genes are located in four separate chromosome clusters, Hoxa, Hoxb, Hoxc, and Hoxd. The expression of Hox genes during development depends upon their position in the chromosomal cluster: genes positioned at the 3′-end are expressed earlier and more anterior, whereas 5′-end genes are expressed at later times and more posterior (reviewed in Refs. 1Deschamps J. Meijlink F. Crit. Rev. Oncog. 1992; 3: 117-173PubMed Google Scholar and 5Duboule D. Morata G. Trends Genet. 1994; 10: 358-364Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Colinear gene expression from these Hox gene clusters may involve an initial change in chromatin structure (histone modification and chromatin decondensation) of the entire loci, which would then facilitate the programmed expression of genes along the clusters by a progressive 3′ to 5′ change in higher order chromatin structure (6Chambeyron S. Bickmore W.A. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1119-1130Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). Treatment of teratocarcinoma cells or embryonic stem cells with retinoic acid (RA), which acts via the retinoic acid receptors (RARα,-β, and -γ and their isoforms (reviewed in Refs. 7Simeone A.

Biochem. 1993; 212: 273-288Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, our laboratory discovered the presence of a retinoic acid response element (RARE) in the 3′ enhancer of the Hoxa1 gene (10LaRosa G.J. Gudas L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1988; 85: 329-333Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11LaRosa G.J. Gudas L.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 3906-3917Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Langston A.W. Gudas L.J. Mech.

Development. 1995; 121: 957-974Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Dupé V. Davenne M. Brocard J. Dollé P. Mark M. Dierich A. Chambon P. Rijli F.M.

We also demonstrated that unlike F9 Wt cells, F9 RARγ-/- cells fail to express the Hoxa1 gene in response to RA (17Boylan J.F. Lohnes D. Taneja R. Chambon P. Gudas L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9601-9605Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Alterations in the normal pattern of Hox gene expression in embryos result in homeotic transformations and malformations, and frequently, in perinatal lethality (3Capecchi M.R. Cold Spring Harb.

For instance, the targeted inactivation in mice of both alleles of the most 3′ member of the Hoxa cluster, the Hoxa1 gene, leads to numerous developmental defects, including hindbrain deficiencies and abnormal skull ossification, and ultimately, to neonatal death (19Lufkin T. Dierich A. Le Meur M. Mark M. Chambon P. Cell. 1991; 66: 1105-1119Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Chisaka O. Musci T.S. Capecchi M.R.

Development. 1993; 119: 319-338Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Numerous studies have demonstrated that the hindbrain defects in Hoxa1-/- mice result in part from the failure of Hoxb1 to reach its anterior limit of expression at the presumptive rhombomere 3/rhombomere 4 (r3/4) boundary, which initiates a cascade of gene misexpression that results in the misspecification of the hindbrain compartments from r2 to r5 (23Gavalas A. Studer M. Lumsden A. Rijli F.M. Krumlauf R. Chambon P. Development. 1998; 125: 1123-1136Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Studer M. Gavalas A. Marshall H. Ariza-McNaughton L. Rijli F.M. Chambon P.

Capecchi M.R. Development. 2000; 127: 933-944Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the ectopic expression of Hoxa1 in transgenic mice leads to the ectopic activation of Hoxb1 in r2, produces anterior abnormalities, including the reorganization of the developing hindbrain, and ultimately results in embryonic death (27Zhang M. Kim H.J. Marshall H. Gendron-Maguire M. Lucas D.A. Baron A. Gudas L.J. Gridley T. Krumlauf R. Grippo J.F. Development. 1994; 120: 2431-2442Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These observations highlight the importance of the Hoxa1 gene and suggest that the regulatory effects of retinoids on cell growth and on embryonic patterning may be exerted, at least in part, through the activation of specific levels of Hoxa1 expression in cells and tissues. Earlier work by this laboratory (28Shen J. Wu H. Gudas L.J. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 259: 274-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) initiated the isolation of Hoxa1 target genes by overexpression of Hoxa1 in F9 teratocarcinoma cells and subsequent comparison of gene expression with that of wild-type F9 cells by subtractive hybridization. These studies resulted in the isolation and identification of novel Hoxa1 target genes, including HA1R-62 (29Shen J. Gudas L.J. Cell Growth Differ. 2000; 11: 11-17PubMed Google Scholar). Other researchers have identified Hoxa1 binding sites in the promoter regions of the neural cell adhesion molecule L1 gene (30Chalepakis G. Wijnholds J. Giese P. Schachner M. Gruss P. DNA Cell Biol. 1994; 13: 891-900Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the Epha2 gene (31Chen J. Ruley H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24670-24675Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), and the Hoxb1 gene (24Studer M. Gavalas A. Marshall H. Ariza-McNaughton L. Rijli F.M. Chambon P. Krumlauf R. Development. 1998; 125: 1025-1036Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Di Rocco G. Gavalas A. Popperl H. Krumlauf R. Mavilio F. Zappavigna V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20506-20515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The identification of additional Hoxa1 target genes is required to understand fully the mechanism of action of the Hoxa1 protein in cells and tissues. In this research we have generated embryonic stem (ES) cells from wild-type, Hoxa1 +/-, and Hoxa1-/- blastocyst-stage mouse embryos to use as a model system in which to characterize in detail the putative genes involved in the Hoxa1 signaling pathway and to identify Hoxa1 target genes by microarray analyses. Isolation of Hoxa1 Homozygous ES Cell Lines—C57Bl/6 Hoxa1+/- mice, generated by replacing the 5′-end of the Hoxa1 coding region with a neomycinR cassette by homologous recombination (19Lufkin T. Dierich A. Le Meur M. Mark M. Chambon P. Cell. 1991; 66: 1105-1119Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), were kindly provided by Dr. Pierre Chambon (Strasbourg-Cédex, France). Hoxa1+/- mice were mated in order to obtain mouse embryos at the blastocyst stage. Female mice were examined every morning for the presence of plugs. The day on which a plug was found was considered to be embryonic day 0.5 (E0.5). Blastocysts were harvested on day E3.5 and individually cultured in ES cell medium (containing 20% fetal calf serum and 2× leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF)) on a feeder layer of mitomycin C-treated embryonic fibroblasts, as previously described (33Auerbach W. Dunmore J.H. Fairchild-Huntress V. Fang Q. Auerbach A.B. Huszar D. Joyner A.L. BioTechniques. 2000; 29 (1030, 1032): 1024-1028Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells from the inner cell mass were trypsinized and replated 8 days after hatching from the zona pellucida. After several rounds of propagation, the murine ES cells were genotyped by PCR, and the cell lines were frozen. Four different Wt cell lines were obtained (EMC-ES-Hoxa1-1, -11, -12, and -17), one heterozygous Hoxa1+/- (EMC-ES-Hoxa1-3), and one homozygous Hoxa1-/- (EMC-ES-Hoxa1-15). Cell lines 1, 3, and 15 were subsequently single-cell cloned and selected for further analyses. PCR Genotyping—The genotypes of the newly generated EMC-ES-Hoxa1 ES cell lines were initially determined by PCR analyses on genomic DNA. Isolation of genomic DNA was performed as described by Lufkin et al. (19Lufkin T. Dierich A. Le Meur M. Mark M. Chambon P. Cell. 1991; 66: 1105-1119Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The sequences of the primers used were provided by Dr. Pierre Chambon. Primers 1 and 3 (P1 and P3) were used to detect the wild-type allele (expected size of the PCR fragment is 567 bp). Primers 2 and 3 (P2 and P3) were employed for the detection of the disrupted Hoxa1 allele (expected size of PCR fragment is 700 bp). The positions of these PCR primers for the detection of each allele are shown in Fig. 1A. The sequences of the primers used for PCR genotyping are as follows: P1, 5′-GCCATTGGCTGGTAGAGTCACGTGT-3′; P2, 5′-GATGGAAGCCGGTCTTGTCGATCAG-3′; P3, 5′-CATGGGAGTCGAGAGGTTTCCAGAG-3′. For PCR reactions, samples were subjected to 45 amplification cycles at 92 °C for 1 min; 62 °C for 2 min, and 72 °C for 1 min; followed by an extension cycle at 72 °C for 10 min. PCR products were separated on a 1% agarose gel and detected by ethidium bromide staining. Karyotyping of EMC-ES-Hoxa1 Cell Lines—Karyotyping of the six EMC-ES-Hoxa1 cell lines was performed by Dr. Margaret Laversha from the Molecular Cytogenetics Core Facility of the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (New York, NY). Metaphases were prepared from subconfluent cultures by standard cytogenetic procedures. Briefly, after a 1-h incubation with colcemid (final concentration 0.02 μg/ml), trypsinized cells were pelleted (250 × g, 5 min) from 25-cm2 flasks and washed briefly in 4 ml of warm 0.075 m KCl, then incubated in 8 ml of fresh hypotonic solution for 5 min at 37 °C before mixing in 2 ml of fresh 3:1 methanol/glacial acetic acid fixative. The cells were washed in three changes of 5 ml of fixative before being resuspended in ∼2 ml of fixative for slide preparation. Fixed cell suspensions were stored at -20 °C. Analysis was performed on 20–25 GTG-banded metaphases from each clone. Images were digitally captured using a Nikon E800 microscope equipped with a SenSys KAF1400-G2 CCD camera (Photometrics, Tucson, AZ), supported by QUIPS imaging and analysis software (Applied Imaging Corp., San Jose, CA). The analysis indicated that most EMC-ES-Hoxa1-1 cells had a trisomy 11 and an unbalanced translocation between chromosomes 8 and 14. Approximately 50% of EMC-ES-Hoxa1-3 cells were of normal karyotype, and the remainder had sporadic structural changes. Approximately 70% of EMC-ES-Hoxa1-15 cells had a chromosome 14 with additional chromosomal material of unknown origin, and 20% of the cells had trisomy 11. About 10% of the cells had a trisomy 1 as a consequence of a Robertsonian fusion between chromosomes 1 and 6. Cell Culture and Drug Treatments—Cells were cultured in ES medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% ES cell qualified fetal calf serum (Invitrogen), 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 100 μm MEM nonessential amino acids, and 0.1 mm β-mercaptoethanol. 1 × 103 units/ml leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF, Esgro, Invitrogen) was added prior to use. Cells were treated with 1 μm RA (Sigma) 24 h after plating on gelatin-coated 100-mm tissue culture plates. Control cells were treated with 0.1% ethanol (vehicle). After various times of drug treatment, cells were harvested for total RNA extraction. For cell proliferation studies, ES cells were plated on 12-well plates at a density of 1 × 104 cells/well. The day after plating, cells were treated in triplicate wells with various doses of RA (1 × 10-9, 1 × 10-8, 1 × 10-7, 5 × 10-7, and 1 × 10-6 m) and incubated for 96 h. After various times in culture, cells were counted using an electronic particle counter (model: Coulter Z1; Beckman Coulter, Inc., Fullerton, CA). Control cells were treated with 0.1% ethanol (vehicle). For the LIF withdrawal studies, EMC-ES-Hoxa1-1 and EMC-ES-Hoxa1-15 were cultured in ES cell medium containing 10% fetal calf serum plus LIF. Cells were then plated on gelatinized 100-mm plates at a density of 1 × 106 cells/plate in the presence or absence of LIF for 24 h, and then they were treated with 1 μm RA or ethanol vehicle for various periods of time and harvested for subsequent Northern blot analyses. Northern Blot Assays—Total RNA samples were isolated from cells and then subjected to Northern blot analysis as described previously (34Chen A.C. Gudas L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14971-14980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). RNA was fractionated by size on 1% agarose, 2.2 m formaldehyde gels, transferred to nylon filters, and cross-linked using a UV Stratalinker 1800. Filters were hybridized to radiolabeled cDNA probes in standard hybridization buffer containing 10% dextran (17Boylan J.F. Lohnes D. Taneja R. Chambon P. Gudas L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9601-9605Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). After washing under high stringency conditions (0.2× SSC, 0.1% SDS for 20 min at 60 °C), hybridization filters were exposed to Kodak BioMax films. Results from Northern blot assays were normalized relative to GAPDH mRNA levels; GAPDH is constitutively expressed in these cells. Quantitation of Northern blots was performed by PhosphorImager analysis (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ), with the aid of the computer software NIH Image 1.62 or Image Quant 1.2. Statistical analyses of Northern blot quantitations were performed by a 2-way analysis of variance using the software GraphPad Prism 4.0. For the statistical analyses of Northern blot assays, normalized quantitations from Hoxa1-3+/- or Hoxa1-15-/- cells were compared with the normalized quantitation from Hoxa1-1 (Wt) cells at the respective time points and drug treatments. Significance indicates a p value of < 0.05. Probes Used for Northern Blot Analyses—The following cDNA probes were used in the Northern blot assays: Hoxa1 (1-kb fragment, initially isolated as ERA-1-993) inserted into the EcoRI site of the pUC-9 vector (10LaRosa G.J. Gudas L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad.

For Hoxa5, a 637-bp fragment was excised with EcoRI-BglII from pUC18-Hoxa5 (formerly known as pUC18-Hox1.3, a gift from Dr. W. F. Odenwald). Hoxb1 was excised as a 435-bp EcoRI-HindIII fragment from pGEM72f-Hoxb1 (35Chen A.C. Yu K. Lane M.A. Gudas L.J. Arch Biochem. Biophys. 2003; 411: 159-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). A 620-bp fragment of Fgf4, cloned into the SmaI site of pBluescript, and an 800-bp fragment of Fgf5, cloned into the SmaI site of pBluescript, were obtained from Dr. Gail Martin (UCSF, San Francisco, CA). The plasmid pRex-1 2-5R contains a 1.7-kb fragment of Rex-1 (Zfp-42) inserted into the EcoRI site of the pUC9 vector (36Hosler B.A. LaRosa G.J. Grippo J.F. Gudas L.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 5623-5629Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). An Oct3/4 cDNA fragment (800 bp) was excised with PstI-EcoRI from the pBSII-Oct3/4 plasmid (a gift from Dr. Yehudit Bergman). Bmp4 was obtained from Dr. John Wozney (37Wozney J.M. Rosen V. Celeste A.J. Mitsock L.M. Whitters M.J. Kriz R.W. Hewick R.M. Wang E.A. Science. 1988; 242: 1528-1534Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Gata-4 was obtained from Dr. Stuart H. Orkin (38Arceci R.J. King A.A. Simon M.C. Orkin S.H. Wilson D.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2235-2246Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A Pbx1 cDNA fragment (750 bp) was obtained by restriction digestion of the plasmid pBS-Pbx1 with EcoRI-NcoI (obtained from Drs. Dwaine Wright and Mark P. Kamps, UC San Diego, San Diego, CA). Similarly, a 1.6-kb cDNA fragment of Meis1 was excised from the EcoRI site of the pMSCV vector (a gift from Drs. Scott Steelman and Arthur M. Buchberg). LamA1 was obtained from Dr. Y. Yamada (39Sasaki M. Kleinman H.K. Huber H. Deutzmann R. Yamada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16536-16544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A 2.4-kb cDNA fragment of Col4a1 was excised from the EcoRI site of the pUC9 vector (40Wang S.Y. Gudas L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 5880-5884Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Foxa2 (HNF3β) was obtained from Dr. K. Anderson (Sloan-Kettering Institute, New York, NY). Dab2 and Foxq1 cDNAs were obtained from a F9 cDNA library and cloned into the pT-Adv vector (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) by TA cloning (41Zhuang Y. Faria T.N. Chambon P. Gudas L.J. Mol. Cancer Res. 2003; 1: 619-630PubMed Google Scholar). The following clones were obtained from ATCC: Bmi1 (BE854719), Cdx1 (AA509618), Klf5 (1331265), and Nnat (BG962074). The following cDNAs were amplified by PCR from RA-treated EM-C-ES-Hoxa1-1 cells (for genes up-regulated in Wt) or EMC-ES-Hoxa-1-15 cells (for genes up-regulated in Hoxa1-/- cells) and subsequently cloned into the Topo TA vector (Invitrogen): Postn/Osf2, 758 bp (upper primer, 5′-GACGAAGATCCAAATTGAAGGTGA-3′; lower primer, 5′-CTGAGGCGGAAGGTTTTTACTGT-3′); Col1a1, 424 bp (upper primer, 5′-CTGACCTTCCTGCGCCTAATGT-3′; lower primer, 5′-TTGAGTTTGGGTTGTTCGTCTGTT-3′); Wisp1, 685 bp (upper primer, 5′-CCAGAGGAGGCCACGAACTT-3′; lower primer, 5′-GTCCCCAATCCCATCCATCTGTCT-3′); Hoxc9, 561 bp (upper primer, 5′-GGCAGCAAGCACAAAGAGGAGAA-3′; lower primer, 5′-TTGCGCTGGGGAAGAGAACG-3′); RAE3, 479 bp (upper primer, 5′-CGGCGCTGGTCTGAACATCCT-3′; lower primer, 5′-TCAGCCCTGCAGCCCCATCTA-3′). The identities of the amplified cDNAs were confirmed by DNA sequencing in the sequencing facility of Cornell University in Ithaca, NY. RT-PCR Analysis—Total RNA was extracted from both wild-type and Hoxa1-/- ES cells treated with RA for 0, 24, and 48 h. RNA was treated with RNase-free DNase I (Invitrogen) to eliminate any residual genomic DNA, and then reverse-transcribed with Superscript II (Invitrogen) and primed with 1 μg of random hexanucleotides. Samples were amplified in the linear range by PCR using the following primers: Wnt3a, 507 bp (upper primer, 5′-CGGGCGCGGGCATAACG-3′; lower primer, 5′-CCATCCGCACGAACCCCACCTA-3′); RhoB, 442 bp (upper primer, 5′-CACGGCAGGCCAGGAGGACTAC-3′; lower primer, 5′-GCAAGGGCGTGAGGCAGGAC-3′); Cdkn2b, 647 bp (upper primer, 5′-CCGTGACATTGCGAGGTATC-3′; lower primer, 5′-CAGAATCCAGGCATCAAGGCAACT-3′); Gbx2, 767 (upper primer, 5′-ATCGCCCACGCCCTCAAACTC-3′; lower primer, 5′-TGCTTCCGACATGGCTCAGATAGG-3′); M-Ras, 529 bp (upper primer, 5′-ACCAGGGACCAAGGAAAAGAAATG-3′; lower primer 5′-CTGGTGCGTTGTATGTGGGTAAGC-3′); Sox17, 477 bp (upper primer, 5′-GCCGGCACCTACACTTACG-3′; lower primer, 5′-GTCGGACACCACGGAGGAAATG-3′); Gapdh, 432 bp (upper primer, 5′-ACCACAGTCCATGCCATCAC-3′; lower primer, 5′-TCCACCACCCTGTTGCTGTA-3′). Microarray Analysis—Wild-type and Hoxa1-/- ES cells were treated with 1 μm RA for 24 and 48 h in the presence of LIF, and total RNA was extracted using RNAStat-60 (Tel-Test, Inc.; Friendswood, TX) as indicated by the manufacturers. The differential expression of putative Hoxa1 target genes in EMC-ES-Hoxa1-1 versus EMC-ES-Hoxa1-15 ES cells was examined according to the Affymetrix microchip array protocol (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). Briefly, single strand cDNA was prepared from 20 μg of total RNA by reverse transcription. After second strand synthesis, cRNA was prepared by in vitro transcription of double strand cDNA with biotinylated ribonucleotides (Enzo Diagnostics, Farmingdale, NY). cRNA was then fragmented by heating at 95 °C for 35 min and then mixed with control oligonucleotide, control cRNA (composed of biotin B, biotin C, biotin D, and Cre), and herring sperm DNA. This mixture was hybridized to MG-U74Av2 microarray chips for 16 h at 45 °C. The MG-U74Av2 microarray chips contain all sequences (∼6000) in the mouse UniGene data base that have been functionally characterized, plus ∼6000 ESTs (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). The hybridized microarray chips were washed and stained in a Fluidics station in the Microarray Core facility of the Weill Medical College of Cornell University. The microarray analyses were performed twice on two different starting preparations of ES Wt and Hoxa1-/- ES RNA. Microarray results were analyzed using the computer software Microarray Suite 5.0 from Affymetrix. Scatter plots were performed with Microarray Suite 5.0 software. Data analysis was performed using the computer program GeneSpring (Redwood, CA). Establishment of the Wt, Hoxa1+/-, and Hoxa1-/-ES Cell Lines—The C57BL/6 Hoxa1+/- mice used in this research were provided by Dr. Pierre Chambon. Heterozygous Hoxa1 ES cells were generated by transfection of a construct containing 8 kb of homologous Hoxa1 genomic DNA into wild-type D3 ES cells, followed by homologous recombination (see Fig. 1A). The heterozygous ES line was employed to generate the Hoxa1 knockout mice (19Lufkin T. Dierich A. Le Meur M. Mark M. Chambon P. Cell. 1991; 66: 1105-1119Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To generate Hoxa1 ES cell lines, heterozygous C57BL/6 Hoxa1 mice were mated, and day 3.5 blastocyst-stage embryos were extracted from pregnant females by uterine flushing as previously described (33Auerbach W. Dunmore J.H. Fairchild-Huntress V. Fang Q. Auerbach A.B. Huszar D. Joyner A.L. BioTechniques. 2000; 29 (1030, 1032): 1024-1028Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Six different ES cell lines were initiated, each from a different blastocyst, and these were genotyped by PCR. Of these, four were wild type (EMC-ES-Hoxa1-1, -11, -12, and -17), one was Hoxa1 heterozygous (EMC-ES-Hoxa1-3), and one Hoxa1 homozygous knockout (EMC-ES-Hoxa1-15; Fig. 1B). Of the wild-type ES cell lines, EMC-ES-Hoxa1-1 was selected for subsequent experiments, in addition to the EMC-ES-Hoxa1-3 and EMC-ES-Hoxa1-15 ES cells. The genotypes of these three ES cell lines were further confirmed by Northern blot analysis (Fig. 1C). RA induced the transcription of the wild-type Hoxa1 gene (transcript size about 2.2 kb, arrowhead in Fig. 1C) in both Hoxa1-1 (Wt) and Hoxa1-3+/- ES cells, although RA-inducible Hoxa1 mRNA levels were about 4–7-fold lower in heterozygous cells than in wild-type cells, as demonstrated by quantitative analyses of the Northern blot assays (Fig. 1D). The upper band in Fig. 1C (about 4 kb; arrow) results from the transcription of the disrupted allele. Induction of Hoxa Cluster Gene Expression by RA in the Absence of Hoxa1—As a first step toward the characterization of our Hoxa1-/- ES cells, we asked whether the expression of other Hox genes is altered in these Hoxa1-null cells lines. Knockout inactivation of the Hoxa1 gene has demonstrated that Hoxa1 is not required for the correct expression of Hoxa cluster genes (e.g. Hoxa2, Hoxa3, and Hoxa4) in the Hoxa1 mutant embryos (42Dollé P. Lufkin T. Krumlauf R. Mark M. Duboule D. Chambon P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1993; 90: 7666-7670Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, these experiments do not exclude the possibility that Hoxa1 may be required for the RA-induced colinear expression of H"

In this study, we describe a molecular mechanism linking phosphorylation of Na+,K+-ATPase α-subunit to binding and activation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase. Co-immunoprecipitation studies, as well as experiments using confocal microscopy, revealed that dopamine favored the association of 14-3-3 protein with the basolateral plasma membrane and its co-localization with the Na+,K+-ATPase α-subunit. The functional relevance of this interaction was established in opossum kidney cells expressing a 14-3-3 dominant negative mutant, where dopamine failed to decrease Na+,K+-ATPase activity and to promote its endocytosis. The phosphorylated Ser-18 residue within the α-subunit N terminus is critical for 14-3-3 binding. Activation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase by dopamine during Na+,K+-ATPase endocytosis requires the binding of the kinase to a proline-rich domain within the α-subunit, and this effect was blocked by the presence of a 14-3-3 dominant negative mutant. Thus, the 14-3-3 protein represents a critical linking mechanism for recruiting phosphoinositide 3-kinase to the site of Na+,K+-ATPase endocytosis.

Regulation of Na+,K+-ATPase activity by hormones within the renal tubule epithelial cells provides control for transepithelial sodium transport and thereby urinary sodium excretion during salt loading or deprivation (1Aperia A.C. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2000; 62: 621-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). During its regulation, the Na+,K+-ATPase molecule shuttles between the plasma membrane and intracellular compartments in response to hormones (2Pedemonte C.H. Bertorello A.M. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2001; 33: 439-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Thus, a balance between the increase or decrease in the number of copies within the plasma membrane determines the cell Na+,K+-ATPase activity. The responses to different agonists regulating the intracellular distribution of Na+,K+-ATPase are tissue-specific (3Teixeira V.L. Katz A.I. Pedemonte C.H. Bertorello A.M. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2003; 986: 587-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), and in renal tubule cells, the direction of the physiological response (increase versus decrease) in response to hormones that influence urinary sodium excretion appears to depend largely on the concentration of intracellular sodium (4Efendiev R.

DA-mediated phosphorylation of the α1-subunit and Na+,K+-ATPase endocytosis requires activation of the PKC-ζ isoform, whereas serotonin- and angiotensin II-dependent increase in Na+,K+-ATPase activity requires activation of the PKC-β isoform (11Budu C.

Endocytosis and binding of adaptor protein-2 to the α1-subunit requires the activation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) (16Chibalin A.V. Zierath J.R. Katz A.I. Berggren P-O. Bertorello A.M.

A. 2000; 97: 6556-6561Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). This process is triggered by phosphorylation of the Na+,K+-ATPase α1-subunit and binding of the PI 3-kinase (class IA) p85α regulatory subunit (SH3 domain) to a proline-rich domain (PRD) motif within the α1-subunit N terminus upstream of the PKC phosphorylation site (17Yudowski G.A. Efendiev R. Pedemonte C.H. Katz A.I. Berggren P-O. Bertorello A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6556-6561Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The mechanism that translates phosphorylation of the α1-subunit Ser-18 residue into binding of PI 3-kinase to the PRD is not yet understood.Structural studies using analogous comparisons between the Na+,K+-ATPase α1-subunit and the tertiary structure of the skeletal muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase α1-subunit (they share several common structural/functional features) revealed a structurally exposed PRD motif on the molecule N-domain (18Toyoshima C. Nakasako M Nomura H Ogawa H. Nature. 2000; 405: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1599) Google Scholar, 19Sweadner K.J. Donet C. Biochem. J. 2001; 356: 685-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). This observation may suggest that phosphorylation of the α1-subunit at Ser-18 might not be required for inducing a structural conformation of the Na+,K+-ATPase α1-subunit N terminus to make the PRD accessible for its binding to the PI 3-kinase but rather to facilitate its interaction with a linker that would make, instead, the PI 3-kinase available to the PRD motif.The 14-3-3 proteins represent an important model of scaffolding proteins turning serine-phosphorylated residues within target proteins into recruitment modules linking the components of diverse cellular signaling networks during a functional response (20Aitken A.

Because 14-3-3 proteins are targeted primarily to phosphorylated serine residues and because of their ability to interact with the PI 3-kinase (23Yao B. Zhang Y.H. Delikat S. Mathias S. Basu S.

The cells at 90% confluence in 10-cm dishes were exposed for 24 h to the mixture of 25 μl of LipofectAMINE 2000 and 10 μg of plasmid, preincubated according to Invitrogen protocol. Mutations in the PKC phosphorylation site (S11A and S18A), amino acid deletions, and stable expression of the Na+,K+-ATPase α1-subunit were performed as described previously (8Chibalin A.V.

Cell Sci. 1992; 101: 343-347Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) from Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 150–200 g. Briefly, homogenates from the kidney outermost cortex were minced and incubated with 0.7 mg/ml collagenase A (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Manheim, Germany) in 10 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, (Invitrogen). The incubation lasted for 20 min at 37 °C, and the solution was continuously exposed to 95% O2/5% CO2 during this period. After pouring the material through graded sieves, the cell suspension consisting mostly of PCT cells was washed (four times in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium) and finally resuspended in Hanks' medium (Invitrogen) to yield a protein concentration of ∼1–3 mg/ml. The experiments were performed immediately after preparation.Preparation of Basolateral Membranes—Basolateral membranes were obtained from PCT cells using a Percoll (Amersham Biosciences AB, Uppsala, Sweden) gradient centrifugation as described previously (28Bertorello A.M. Ridge K.M. Chibalin A.V. Katz A.I. Sznajder J.I. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: L20-L27PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, postnuclear supernatants were centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The yellow layer obtained was resuspended in homogenization buffer and further centrifuged at 48,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of homogenization buffer, and 0.2 ml of Percoll was added. The suspension was gently mixed and centrifuged at 48,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C.Biotin Labeling—Transiently transfected cells after 24 h were transferred to Hanks' solution for 30 min and then incubated for 5 min with 1 μm DA or vehicle at room temp. Incubation was stopped on ice, and the medium was changed to ice-cold 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 2 mm CaCl2, 150 mm NaCl, 1.5 mg/ml sulfo-N-hydroxysuccinimidobiotin, the cells were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. Following biotin labeling, the cells were scraped into immunoprecipitation buffer (20 mm Tris, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 30 mm sodium pyrophosphate, pH 7.3) containing a protease inhibitor mixture, frozen in liquid nitrogen, thawed rapidly, probe-sonicated twice on ice-water bath, and frozen-thawed again. The cell suspension was centrifuged at 14,000 × g at 4 °C for 5 min. Supernatants were transferred to clean tubes, and 1% Triton X-100 and 0.2% SDS were added. Anti-α1 monoclonal antibody was added and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with end-over-end shaking and then protein A/G-agarose, pre-washed three times with PBS and once with immunoprecipitation buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, was added and incubated overnight. The pellet was washed three times with this buffer containing 1% Triton X-100 and 0.1% SDS, once with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), and finally resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer.

After centrifugation at 800 × g for 10 min, the supernatant was collected, and 500 μg of protein (in 1 ml) was incubated with an antibody against the Na+,K+-ATPase α-subunit (gift of Dr. Mercer) by end-over-end rotating overnight. The next morning, 40 μl of protein A/G-agarose beads (Pharmacia Corp.) were added and incubated for 2 h by end-over-end rotating. The immune complex was washed three times with lysis buffer, two times with washing buffer 2 (137 mm NaCl, 0.1 m Tris-HCl, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.2 mm PMSF, 10 mm NaF, 10 mg/ml aprotinin), once with washing buffer 3 (0.15 M NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.2 mm PMSF, 10 mm NaF, 10 mg/ml aprotinin), once with washing buffer 4 (20 mm Hepes, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm MgCl2, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.2 mm PMSF, 10 mm NaF, 10 mg/ml aprotinin), and then resuspended in 20 μl of kinase assay buffer (20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 5 mm Na-pyrophosphate, 30 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol). The PI 3-K activity in the immunoprecipitate was assessed directly on the protein A/G-agarose beads as described previously (29Krook A. Whitehead J.P. Dobson S.P. Griffiths M.R. Ouwens M. Barker C.

The reaction was initiated by the addition of 30 μl of reaction mixture (20 μl of buffer (12.5 μm ATP, 7.6 mm MgCl2,20mm β-glycerophosphate, 5 mm Na-pyrophosphate, 30 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 4μCi [γ-32P]ATP) plus 40 μg of lipids (Avanti Biochemicals, Birmingham, AL) in 10 μl of cholate buffer (10 mg sodium cholate/1 ml kinase assay buffer)). The pellets were incubated for 15 min at room temperature, and the reaction was terminated by the sequential addition of 20 μl of HCl and 160 μl of chloroform/methanol (1:1, v/v) with vigorous vortexing. After centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 5 min, 80 μl of the lower phase was spotted on aluminum-backed silica gel thin layer chromatography plates (Merck). The lipids were resolved by chromatography in methanol/CHCl3/ammonia/H2O (47:34:12.5:6.5). The dot corresponding to phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate was analyzed by autoradiography and quantitated using phosphorimaging.Immunoprecipitation—OK cells grown in Petri dishes (10 cm) were incubated in Hanks' medium for 30 min at 25 °C prior to incubation in the presence or absence of 1 μm DA for the times indicated above at 23 °C. Thereafter, incubation solutions were replaced by immunoprecipitation buffer (in mm, 100 NaCl, 50 Tris-HCl, 2 EGTA, 1 PMSF, 5 mg/ml protease inhibitors (aprotinin, leupeptin, antipain), and 1% Triton X-100, pH 7.5), and the samples were transferred to ice. The cells were disrupted by homogenization with a motor pestle homogenizer. Immunoprecipitation of the Na+,K+-ATPase α1-subunit, PI 3-kinase, and 14-3-3 was performed as described previously (13Efendiev R. Bertorello A.M. Pressley T.A. Rousselot M. Féraille E. Pedemonte C.H. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9884-9892Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In brief, aliquots (500 μg of protein) were incubated overnight at 4 °C with 70 μl of a Na+,K+-ATPase antibody (gift from Dr. Mercer), 6 μg of a polyclonal antibody raised against the PI 3-kinase p85α subunit (Z-8, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or with 5 μg of 14-3-3 antibody (K-19, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and the simultaneous addition of excess protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences AB, Uppsala, Sweden). Protein content was determined according to Bradford (30Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (213098) Google Scholar). Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE using the Laemmli buffer system (31Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205922) Google Scholar). Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Hybond-P, Amersham Biosciences AB), and Western blots were performed using an antibody against the Na+,K+-ATPase α1-subunit and developed with an ECL Plus (Amersham Biosciences AB) detection kit.Microscopy—These experiments were performed using OK cells stably transfected with the Na+,K+-ATPase α1-subunit carrying a green fluorescent protein tag in the NH2 terminus. The presence of the tag does not affect the intrinsic properties of the enzyme or its regulation by dopamine signals (14Done S.C. Leibiger I.B. Efendiev R. Katz A.I. Leibiger B. Berggren P.O.

OK cells were incubated in the presence or absence of 1 μm DA for 2 min at 23 °C. Incubation was terminated by fixation of the cells with 4% formaldehyde in PBS for 10 min at room temperature. After rinsing twice with PBS, the cells were transferred to acetone (–20 °C) for 5 min and then quenched with PBS (containing 1% bovine serum albumin) for 30 min. Staining with primary (14-3-3 (1: 100)) and secondary fluorescent-labeled antibody (1:100) was performed at room temperature for 1 h. After rinsing with PBS, the coverslips were mounted (SlowFade Light, Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) and examined using a confocal microscope (Leica TCS SP2, Leica Lasertechnik GmbH, Heidelberg, Germany).Statistics—Comparison between two experimental groups was made with the non-paired Student's t test. p < 0.05 was considered significant. In all figures, bars indicate mean ± S.D.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONPhosphorylation of the Na+,K+-ATPase α1-subunit in response to G protein-coupled receptor (DA) stimulation is central for organizing, in time and space, a variety of signals that ultimately will lead to the endocytosis of Na+,K+-ATPase molecules. Among those signals, binding (to a proline-rich motif within the Na+,K+-ATPase α1-subunit) and activation of PI 3-kinase activity are of utmost relevance for recruiting recognition molecules (adaptins) and clathrin formation (15Ogimoto G.

Phosphorylation of the Na+,K+-ATPase α1-subunit at Ser-18 is critical for PI 3-kinase binding, but the molecular mechanisms of this interaction remain unknown.

Inoki K. Yeung R. Guan K-L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44593-44596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The 14-3-3 protein was present in PCT cells, and high speed centrifugation of PCT cell homogenate revealed that most of the protein is present in the cytosol (Fig. 1A). Although a negligible amount was associated with the basolateral membrane fraction, the presence of DA induced a time-dependent increase in the abundance of 14-3-3 within this compartment (Fig. 1B). Additionally, confocal images of OK cells revealed the presence of 14-3-3 mostly in the cytosol in non-treated cells (V: vehicle) (Fig. 1C), whereas in the presence of DA, there is an increased 14-3-3 immunofluorescence associated with the plasma membrane (arrows) (Fig. 1C, D (dopamine)). Furthermore, support for a direct association of 14-3-3 with the Na+,K+-ATPase molecules at the plasma membrane in response to DA signals was obtained in co-immunoprecipitation assays. DA treatment is associated with increased Na+,K+-ATPase immunoreactivity in the material immunoprecipitated with a 14-3-3 protein antibody (Fig. 2A, left panel), and in the reciprocal experiment, increased 14-3-3 is observed in the material immunoprecipitated with a Na+,K+-ATPase antibody (Fig. 2A, right panel). These results strongly suggest that, in response to DA signals, the 14-3-3 becomes associated with basolateral plasma membrane, where it binds to the phosphorylated Ser-18 residue in the Na+,K+-ATPase α1-subunit.Fig. 2A, interaction of 14-3-3 with the Na+,K+-ATPase. Homogenates (500 mg) from PCT cells previously incubated in the presence (DA) or absence (V, vehicle) of 1 μm DA for 2 min at 23 °C were incubated with either a Na+,K+-ATPase (right panel) or 14-3-3 (left panel) (5 μg) antibody. The immunoprecipitated (IP) material was analyzed by Western blot (WB) with either Na+,K+-ATPase (1:1000) or 14-3-3 (1:500) antibody. A representative Western blot of five experiments is shown. B, co-immunoprecipitation of the Na+,K+-ATPase with 14-3-3 protein was performed exactly as described above for A in OK cells stably transfected with the Na+,K+-ATPase bearing the mutation Ser11→ Ala (S11A), Ser18→ Ala (S18A), or deletion of the first 26 amino acids (Δ26) in the α1-subunit, as described by Chibalin et al.

Growth and survival factor-activated Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK signaling can also regulate Hdm2 expression independently of p53, contributing to the pro-survival effect of these factors. In murine fibroblasts, this occurs through the regulation of mdm2 mRNA transcription. Here we show that, in human breast cancer epithelial cells, MEK-dependent regulation of Hdm2 expression also occurs at a post-transcriptional level. Pharmacological blockade of MEK activity in T47D cells inhibits Hdm2 protein synthesis by 80–90%. This occurs in the absence of changes in the expression of the major hdm2-P1 mRNA transcript and only an ∼40% reduction in hdm2-P2 transcript levels. The amounts of both transcripts that are associated with polyribosomes and are, hence, being actively translated are reduced by >80% by the MEK inhibitor, U0126. We show here that this is due to the inhibition of hdm2 mRNA export from the nucleus when MEK activity is inhibited. In MCF-7 breast cancer cells that express wild-type p53, Hdm2 is required to suppress p53-dependent transcription when MEK kinase is active. Regulation of the nuclear export of hdm2 mRNA provides, therefore, a mechanism whereby mitogen-stimulated cells avoid p53-dependent cell cycle arrest or apoptosis by maintaining the dynamic equilibrium of the Hdm2-p53 feedback loop.

Cellular p53 activity is inhibited in proliferating cells and is activated under situations such as cellular stress as part of a growth arrest or apoptosis response. Hdm2 functions principally as the primary negative regulator of p53 function (6Momand J. Wu H.H. Dasgupta G. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 242: 15-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar), and its correct expression and function can be essential for the prevention of spontaneous p53-dependent apoptosis or cell cycle arrest (7Jones S.N.

Proliferative and pro-survival signaling pathways can also impinge upon p53 through either the positive or negative regulation of Hdm2 function. v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homologue kinase, a key enzyme in pro-survival signaling pathways, phosphorylates Hdm2, which results in elevated Hdm2 levels in the nucleus (18Mayo L.D.

Der C.J. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 8999-9006Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar), and its regulation of the p53-Hdm2 axis appears to be similarly complex. Signaling via this cascade can induce the expression of p14ARF, an Hdm2 antagonist, resulting in p53 activation. This can be an important block to cancer progression, and p14ARF expression is lost in many tumors (22Sharpless N.E. DePinho R.A. Curr. Opin. Genet.

In contrast, induction of Hdm2 expression by the Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK can play an important role in the proliferative and pro-survival response to growth factors (24Shaulian E. Resnitzky D. Shifman O.

Indeed, this increased expression of Hdm2 may dampen the p53 response to activating signals such as genotoxic cancer therapies, particularly in tumor cells in which p14ARF expression is lost (24Shaulian E.

Conversely, transgenic mutations that result in as little as a 20% loss of Mdm2 expression in adult mice result in increased sensitivity to radiation (26Mendrysa S.M. McElwee M.K. Michalowski J. O'Leary K.A. Young K.M. Perry M.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 462-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Hdm2 is normally present at very low levels in cells, as the protein directs its own auto-ubiquitination and is rapidly degraded (27Fang S. Jensen J.P. Ludwig R.L. Vousden K.H. Weissman A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8945-8951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (858) Google Scholar). Elevation of Hdm2 expression occurs at varying frequencies in diverse tumor types (28Onel K. Cordon-Cardo C. Mol. Cancer Res. 2004; 2: 1-8PubMed Google Scholar). In a proportion of cancers, this is a consequence of hdm2 gene amplification (29Oliner J.D. Kinzler K.W. Meltzer P.S. George D.L. Vogelstein B. Nature. 1992; 358: 80-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (1778) Google Scholar), although in many cases, alternative mechanisms must underlie the increase (28Onel K. Cordon-Cardo C. Mol. Cancer Res. 2004; 2: 1-8PubMed Google Scholar). hdm2 expression is regulated by transcription from two promoters, P1 and P2 (5Zauberman A. Flusberg D. Barak Y. Oren M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 2584-2592Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Transcription from P1 is considered to be constitutive in most cells (30Mendrysa S.M. Perry M.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2023-2030Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), whereas P2-promoter activity is highly induced by p53 (5Zauberman A. Flusberg D. Barak Y. Oren M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 2584-2592Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). The murine mdm2 P2-promoter is also induced by Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK signaling (25Ries S. Biederer C. Woods D. Shifman O.

Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 2002; 71: 77-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), and we have provided evidence for a role for p53-independent transcription from the P2-promoter in this increased expression (37Phelps M. Darley M. Primrose J.N. Blaydes J.P. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 2616-2623PubMed Google Scholar). In this present study we have investigated the role of Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK signaling in controlling the levels of Hdm2 protein in breast cancer cells and demonstrate a key role for this pathway in regulating the export of hdm2 mRNA to the cytoplasm. Culture of Human Breast Cancer Cell Lines—MCF-7 and T47D breast cancer cell lines were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Autogen Bioclear) as described previously (37Phelps M. Darley M. Primrose J.N. Blaydes J.P. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 2616-2623PubMed Google Scholar). The following reagents were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) at the indicated concentrations before adding to the medium where stated; 10 mm U0126 (Promega), 20 mm PD98059 (Promega), 10 mm MG132 (Sigma). Cycloheximide (Sigma) and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) (David Bull Laboratories) were in aqueous solutions. Nutlin-3 (Alexis Biochemicals) was dissolved in ethanol at 5 mm. Protein Analysis—Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, pelleted by centrifugation at 1000 × g, snap-frozen, and stored at –80 °C. For immunoblotting, pellets were lysed for 15 min at 4 °C in denaturing urea buffer (7 m urea, 0.1 m dithiothreitol, 0.05% Triton X-100, 25 mm NaCl, 20 mm HEPES pH 7.6) then clarified by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 10 min. Protein concentration was determined by the method of Bradford (Bio-Rad). Immunoblotting was performed by standard procedures, as described previously (38Blaydes J.P. Hupp T.R. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1045-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), and membranes were probed for Hdm2 (monoclonal antibody 2A9 (39Chen J. Marechal V. Levine A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4107-4114Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar)), p53 (DO-1, Serotec), phospho-Thr-202/Tyr-204 ERK1 and ERK2 (E10), total ERK1 and ERK2 (both from Cell Signaling Technology), or p21WAF-1 (Clone SX118, Pharmingen). Equal protein loading was confirmed on all immunoblots using rabbit anti-β actin antibody (Sigma). Bands were visualized by chemiluminescence (Supersignal, Pierce) using a Fluor-S MAX system (Bio-Rad) and quantified using Quantity One software (Bio-Rad). For labeling of newly synthesized proteins, cells were washed twice with labeling medium (RPMI medium without methionine, cysteine, or l-glutamine (Sigma) supplemented with dialyzed and heat-inactivated fetal calf serum) then incubated with labeling medium for 30 min before the addition of fresh labeling medium containing 0.25 mCi/ml Pro-mix L-[35S] (Amersham Biosciences) and incubation at 37 °C for 90 min. Cells were then processed as for protein analysis. After the gel was stained using Coomassie Blue, it was dried and exposed to a phosphor image plate for 5 h. Bands were visualized using a Personal Molecular Imager FX (Bio-Rad). RNA Analysis—RNA extraction from cell pellets and cell fractions was performed using either RNABee (Biogenesis Inc.) or RNAeasy (Qiagen). Ribonuclease protection assay (RPA) for hdm2 was performed as previously described (37Phelps M. Darley M. Primrose J.N. Blaydes J.P. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 2616-2623PubMed Google Scholar). For Taqman quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) analysis of hdm2 transcripts, 0.5–1 μg of RNA was used to generate cDNA using Superscript II RNase H– reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and oligo(dT) primers in a 20-μl volume. Oligonucleotide primer pairs and probes were designed using Primer Express, Version 2.0 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and were synthesized by MWG Biotech. Each primer sequence lies within a different exon, and the fluorogenic probe spans the junction between the two exons. hdm2 coding sequence primers amplify a region around the exon 9–10 boundary. Primers and probe for gapdh, which was used as an endogenous control gene, were purchased as a Pre-Developed TaqMan® reagent assay (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Analysis was performed using the ABI PRISM 7900HT sequence detection system instrument and software (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). qPCR was performed in 20-μl reaction volumes containing 1× qPCR™; Mastermix (Eurogentec), cDNA (from 5 ng of RNA), and one of the following sets of primers and probes: hdm2-coding sequence F (TCTACAGGGACGCCATCGA) and hdm2-coding sequence R (CTGATCCAACCAATCACCTGAA) (300 nm each) and hdm2-coding sequence probe (FAM-TTCACTTACACCAGCATCAAGATCCGGA-TAMRA) (FAM and TAMRA are trademarks of Applera Corp., Norwalk, CT) (100 nm); hdm2-P1-F (GACTCCAAGCGCGAAAACC) and hdm2-P1-R (CCATCAGTAGGTACAGACATGTTGGT) primers (900 nm each) and hdm2-P1 probe (FAM-TGCACATTTGCCTGCTCCTCACCAT-TAMRA) (200 nm); hdm2-P2-F (CGGACGCACGCCACTT) and hdm2-P2-R (CAGTAGGTACAGACATGTTGGTATTGC) primers (900 nm each) and hdm2-P2 probe (FAM-TTCTCTGCTGATCCAGGCAAATG-TAMRA) (200 nm). Threshold cycle values were converted to relative transcript levels using a standard curve. Semiquantitative reverse transcription-PCR was performed as described previously (37Phelps M. Darley M. Primrose J.N. Blaydes J.P. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 2616-2623PubMed Google Scholar); primers used were gapdh reverse transcription oligo(dT) forward, GAAGGTGAAGGTCGGAGT, and reverse, GAAGATGGTGATGGGATTTC; scRNA hY4 reverse transcription AAAAAGCCAGTCAAATTTAGCA, forward, GGTCCGATGGTAGTGGGTTA, and reverse, AAAGCCAGTCAAATTTAGCAGT. Cellular fractionation before RNA extraction or polyribosome analysis was performed using hypotonic lysis (40Brewer G. Ross J. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 181: 202-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Cells were washed twice with serum-free medium, then scraped in serum-free medium and pelleted by centrifugation at 365 × g. Pellets were resuspended in hypotonic lysis buffer B (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 1 mm CH3COOK, 1.5 mm CH3COOMg, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 unit/μl RNase inhibitor), and cells were lysed on ice using a Dounce homogenizer. Lysates were centrifuged at 12,000 × g to separate the cytoplasmic extract from the nuclear pellet. For some extractions, the lysis buffer was modified where indicated (B1, B2, B3). For analysis of polyribosome associated mRNA (40Brewer G. Ross J. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 181: 202-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), cycloheximide (10 μg/ml) was added to the serum-free medium used to wash the dishes. Cytoplasmic lysates were then layered over a cushion of 30% (w/v) sucrose in buffer B and centrifuged at 130,000 × g for 2.5 h at 4 °C. After removing the supernatant, the remaining polyribosome-bound RNA pellet was rinsed twice in buffer B before RNA extraction. For fractionation over a sucrose gradient, 1200 μl of cytoplasmic lysate containing 700 μg of protein was layered over a 3.6-ml sucrose gradient (15–55% in buffer B containing 150 μg/ml cycloheximide). This was centrifuged at 130,000 × g for 2.5 h at 4 °C, and 12 × 400-μl fractions were removed for analysis. For in situ hybridization a 202-base pair region of the hdm2 coding sequence (within exons 7Jones S.N. Roe A.E. Donehower L.A. Bradley A.

Sense and antisense digoxigenin-labeled RNA probes were generated using a digoxigenin RNA-labeling kit (Roche Diagnostics). Cells growing on glass coverslips were fixed for 20 min at room temperature with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline and dehydrated in ethanol before storage at –70 °C, desiccated. After rehydration, in situ hybridization was performed essentially as described previously (41Komminoth P. Radioactive in Situ Hybridization Manual. Roche Applied Science, Basel, Switzerland2002: 149-164Google Scholar). Bound probe was detected using anti-digoxigenin-rhodamine, Fab fragments (Roche Diagnostics), and cell nuclei were stained with 4′,6-diamidine-2′phenylindole dihydrochloride (Roche Diagnostics). Plasmids, Transfections, and Reporter Gene Assays—The hdm2luc03 reporter vector (37Phelps M. Darley M. Primrose J.N. Blaydes J.P. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 2616-2623PubMed Google Scholar) contains 165 bp of the hdm2-P2 promoter region, including two p53-responsive elements, in pGL3Basic (Promega). SuperTIP, which encodes an inhibitor of the p53-Hdm2 interaction, and the inactive control MutantTIP have been described previously (11Bottger A. Bottger V. Sparks A. Liu W.L. Howard S.F. Lane D.P. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 860-869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). pC53SCX3, which encodes Ala-143 mutant p53, was a gift of Professor Bert Vogelstein. T47D and MCF-7 cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen), and reporter assays were performed using a Dual-Glo™ luciferase assay (Promega) on cells transfected in 96-well plates, with normalization to Renilla luciferase expressed from pRLSV40 (Promega). The normalized data is presented as relative luciferase units. For transfection of siRNA, reagents were obtained from Qiagen. Cells in 60-mm dishes were transfected with 5.5 μg of either control (non-silencing) siRNA or validated siRNA for Hs-mdm2 (hdm2). Transfection was for 24 h, and the cells were lysed a further 24 h later. Pharmacological Inhibition of MEK Activity Suppresses Hdm2 Protein Synthesis in T47D Breast Cancer Cells—Compared with a panel of breast cancer cell lines, estrogen receptor-α positive (ERα+ve) lines such as T47D and MCF-7 express relatively high levels of Hdm2 protein (37Phelps M. Darley M. Primrose J.N. Blaydes J.P. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 2616-2623PubMed Google Scholar). T47D cells express only a transcriptionally inactive mutant p53 protein, and therefore, this cell line provides a useful model for the study of p53-independent mechanisms that regulate the expression of Hdm2. Findings made in this simple model can then be extrapolated into the more complex situation present in cell lines such as MCF-7, which are more representative of the majority of ERα+ve breast cancers, in which changes in Hdm2 expression and p53 activity are dampened by a negative feedback loop (42Lev Bar-Or R. Maya R. Segel L.A. Alon U. Levine A.J. Oren M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11250-11255Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). We determined the effect of pharmacological inhibition of MEK activity on the levels of Hdm2 protein in proliferating T47D cells. Consistent with studies in other cell types (24Shaulian E. Resnitzky D. Shifman O. Blandino G. Amsterdam A. Yayon A. Oren M. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2717-2725Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 25Ries S. Biederer C. Woods D. Shifman O. Shirasawa S. Sasazuki T. McMahon M. Oren M. McCormick F. Cell. 2000; 103: 321-330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar), 24 h exposure to 25 μm U0126 or 50 μm PD98059, two specific and structurally unrelated inhibitors of MEK activity (43Davies S.P. Reddy H. Caivano M. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 95-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (3910) Google Scholar), reduced Hdm2 levels by up to 95% (Fig. 1A). Loss of the phosphorylated form of ERK1 and ERK2 confirmed that MEK was effectively inhibited by 25 μm U0126 in these cells (Fig. 1B). Removal of U0126 and the addition of fresh medium led to the recovery of Hdm2 to greater than pretreatment levels within 2–3 h (Fig. 1C). This recovery did not occur if U0126 was included in the medium (data not shown). Hdm2 protein is rapidly turned over in most cells. The reduction in Hdm2 protein levels in U0126-treated T47D cells is not due to a further increase in the rate of Hdm2 protein turnover, as assayed by the rates at which Hdm2 protein levels decrease after the inhibition of protein synthesis by cycloheximide (Fig. 2A). 12 h of exposure to 25 μm U0126 reduced Hdm2 protein levels by 70%; however, the half-life of Hdm2 was ∼15 min in both control- and U0126-treated cells. We then investigated whether U0126 affects Hdm2 protein synthesis by determining the rate at which Hdm2 protein accumulates when its primary degradation pathway is blocked by a proteasome inhibitor MG132 (this method was used in preference to conventional metabolic labeling studies due to the extremely short half-life of Hdm2 and our concern that radiolabeling, like other inducers of DNA damage (44de Toledo S.M. Azzam E.I. Dahlberg W.K. Gooding T.B. Little J.B. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 6185-6193Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), would induce post-translational modifications of Hdm2 that could affect its activity and hence turnover). The results shown in Fig. 2B clearly demonstrate that the rate of Hdm2 synthesis is reduced by ∼85% when MEK activity is inhibited by U0126. Global synthesis of new proteins was not inhibited by U0126 in these cells (Fig. 2C). The Effects of Inhibiting MEK Activity on hdm2 mRNA Expression Levels—In the murine mdm2 gene the activity of the P2-promoter is inducible by Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK signaling (25Ries S. Biederer C. Woods D. Shifman O. Shirasawa S. Sasazuki T. McMahon M. Oren M. McCormick F. Cell. 2000; 103: 321-330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). We, therefore, determined the effects of U0126 on the levels of endogenous hdm2 P1- and P2-transcript mRNA using two independent techniques, RPA (Fig. 3A) and qPCR on cDNA generated from polyadenylated mRNA (Fig. 3B). Both RPA and qPCR clearly show that the levels of the predominant P1 transcript is not affected by U0126 treatment, and consistent with this, no U0126-induced changes were detected when qPCR analysis was directed toward a region within the hdm2 coding sequence. RPA did not detect any large changes in hdm2-P2 mRNA levels after U0126 treatment (Fig 3Ai). However, quantitative analysis of multiple independent experiments (Fig. 3Aii) identified a small, but significant difference in P2 transcript levels between Me2SO- and U0126-treated cells (100 ± 24.2% compared with 70.6 ± 15.8%, p < 0.05). This effect could be more reliably detected by the more sensitive qPCR assay, which showed a decrease in the levels of the P2 transcript by 41.1 ± 7.0% (n = 5) after U0126 treatment (Fig. 3B). We had previously been unable to detect this relatively small change using semiquantitative assays (37Phelps M. Darley M. Primrose J.N. Blaydes J.P. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 2616-2623PubMed Google Scholar). The decrease is unlikely to be sufficient to account for the 95% reduction in Hdm2 protein levels that are observed in U0126-treated cells, as siRNA-mediated knock-down of the hdm2-P2 transcript by approximately the same amount as occurs with U0126 treatment results in only a 45% reduction in Hdm2 protein levels (Fig. 3C). MEK Inhibitors Reduce Hdm2 Levels by Regulating the Export of hdm2 mRNA to the Cytoplasm—The data described above suggest that inhibition of MEK activity can affect Hdm2 protein synthesis at a post-transcriptional level. We, therefore, set out to establish whether this might occur at the level of mRNA trafficking or translation. T47D cells were incubated with either U0126 or Me2SO control and then subjected to a gentle hypotonic lysis to generate cytoplasmic extracts suitable for the subsequent analysis of polyribosomes. Initially, qPCR was performed on these extracts to determine levels of hdm2 mRNA transcripts (Fig. 4A). This analysis showed that, after U0126 treatment, both hdm2 mRNA transcripts are significantly under-represented in these cytoplasmic extracts compared with their levels in total mRNA. Specifically, although total cellular levels of the hdm2 P1 transcript were unaffected by U0126, levels in the cytoplasmic fraction were decreased by 64.2%. Likewise, although U0126 decreased overall hdm2-P2 expression by ∼40% as before, the levels of this transcript were further under-represented in the cytoplasmic lysates, being reduced by 71.3% compared with mock-treated controls. These results suggest that U0126 treatment regulates the export of hdm2 mRNA from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. We undertook two further experiments to substantiate these findings. F"
https://openalex.org/W1966887582,"Intestinal fatty acid-binding protein (I-FABP) is a small protein that binds long-chain dietary fatty acids in the cytosol of the columnar absorptive epithelial cells (enterocytes) of the intestine. The binding cavity of I-FABP is much larger than is necessary to bind a fatty acid molecule, which suggests that the protein may be able to bind other hydrophobic and amphipathic ligands such as lipophilic drugs. Herein we describe the binding of three structurally diverse lipophilic drugs, bezafibrate, ibuprofen (both R- and S-isomers) and nitrazepam to I-FABP. The rank order of affinity for I-FABP determined for these compounds was found to be R-ibuprofen ≈ bezafibrate > S-ibuprofen ≫ nitrazepam. The binding affinities were not directly related to aqueous solubility or partition coefficient of the compounds; however, the freely water-soluble drug diltiazem showed no affinity for I-FABP. Drug-I-FABP interaction interfaces were defined by analysis of chemical shift perturbations in NMR spectra, which revealed that the drugs bound within the central fatty acid binding cavity. Each drug participated in a different set of interactions within the cavity; however, a number of common contacts were observed with residues also involved in fatty acid binding. These data suggest that the binding of non-fatty acid lipophilic drugs to I-FABP may increase the cytosolic solubility of these compounds and thereby facilitate drug transport from the intestinal lumen across the enterocyte to sites of distribution and metabolism.

A major limiting factor in the development of clinically useful drugs is poor and variable drug absorption. With few exceptions drug candidates that are not absorbed after oral administration fail during development because of the low patient acceptability of other routes of administration. Thus, there has been considerable interest in the elucidation of the mechanisms that mediate drug transport across the enterocyte. The bulk of the research efforts in the field of drug absorption has been centered on the transport of drug molecules across the apical membrane of the enterocyte (1Hillgren K.M. Kato A. Borchardt R.T. Med. Res. Rev. 1995; 15: 83-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 2Hidalgo I.J. Curr. Top. Med.

In contrast, the study of drug transport across the cellular cytoplasm to the basolateral membrane of the enterocyte has been almost entirely neglected. In this respect the barriers faced by lipophilic drug compounds are similar to those faced by endogenous lipophilic molecules such as fatty acids, where cytoplasmic solubilization is mediated by a family of low molecular mass proteins (12–15 kDa) broadly classed as intracellular lipid-binding proteins (4Banaszak L. Winter N. Xu Z. Bernlohr D.A. Cowan S. Jones T.A. Adv. Protein Chem. 1994; 45: 89-151Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Members of this family include retinol-binding proteins, sterol carrier proteins, and cytosolic fatty acid-binding proteins (FABPs) 1The abbreviations and trivial names used are: FABP, fatty acid-binding protein; ANS, 1-anilino-8-naphthalene sulfonic acid; I-FABP, intestinal fatty acid-binding protein; L-FABP, liver-fatty acid-binding protein; Me2SO, dimethyl sulfoxide; HSA, human serum albumin; HSQC, heteronuclear single-quantum correlation; CPK, Corey, Pauling, Koltun. 1The abbreviations and trivial names used are: FABP, fatty acid-binding protein; ANS, 1-anilino-8-naphthalene sulfonic acid; I-FABP, intestinal fatty acid-binding protein; L-FABP, liver-fatty acid-binding protein; Me2SO, dimethyl sulfoxide; HSA, human serum albumin; HSQC, heteronuclear single-quantum correlation; CPK, Corey, Pauling, Koltun.

The classification of FABPs is based on the tissue in which they were first identified (4Banaszak L. Winter N. Xu Z. Bernlohr D.A. Cowan S. Jones T.A. Adv.

Together, I-FABP and L-FABP constitute ∼3–6% of the total cytosolic protein mass in the enterocyte (10Glatz J.F.C. Van der Vusse G.J. Veerkamp J.H. News Physiol. Sci. 1988; 3: 41-44Google Scholar).FABPs display a common tertiary structure. Their consensus topology consists of two β-sheets, each composed of five antiparallel β-strands capped by a helix-turn-helix motif (4Banaszak L. Winter N. Xu Z. Bernlohr D.A. Cowan S. Jones T.A. Adv. Protein Chem. 1994; 45: 89-151Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The 10 anti-parallel β-strands are organized into a β-barrel, which forms a “clam-like” structure that encloses a large solvated cavity. FABPs function by binding their lipid targets within the water-filled cavity (4Banaszak L. Winter N. Xu Z. Bernlohr D.A. Cowan S. Jones T.A. Adv. Protein Chem. 1994; 45: 89-151Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Available evidence suggests that the α-helical region acts as a “dynamic portal,” which opens to allow ligand entry then interacts with the bound ligand to cap the cavity opening (11Hodsdon M.E. Cistola D.P. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1450-1460Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 12Hodsdon M.E. Cistola D.P. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 2278-2290Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). I-FABP binds fatty acid in a 1:1 stoichiometric ratio, whereas L-FABP binds two fatty acids in an interdependent manner (13Sacchettini J.C. Gordon J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18399-18402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Richieri G.V. Ogata R.T. Kleinfeld A.M. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 7140-7150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). In both cases, the carboxylate head group of one fatty acid chain interacts with the positively charged guanidinium side chain of an arginine residue. In the case of L-FABP, the second fatty acid binds “tail first” in the binding cavity leaving the carboxylate region fully exposed (15Thompson J. Winter N. Terwey D. Bratt J. Banaszak L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7140-7150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). The capacity of L-FABP to bind fatty acid in the absence of a charge interaction led to the speculation that L-FABP may possess specificity for ligands other than fatty acids. Indeed, it has been demonstrated that certain FABPs, in particular L-FABP, are able to bind to a range of bulky hydrophobic ligands (16Vincent S.H. Muller-Eberhard U. J. Biol.

Since the concentration of L-FABP in the enterocyte is far greater than the concentration of free fatty acid, it is possible that interactions with other hydrophobic ligands, even those with lower affinity than fatty acids, may be biologically significant.In addition to their role in cytosolic solubilization of endogenous lipophilic molecules, FABPs appear to act as transport proteins. It has been demonstrated that FABPs are capable of transporting fatty acid from the apical membrane to the endoplasmic reticulum or the nucleus (23Hsu K.T. Storch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13317-13323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 24Storch J. Thumser A.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1486: 28-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar, 25Thumser A.E. Storch J. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 647-656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been proposed that the high levels of expression of both I- and L-FABP are required for the optimal transport of fatty acids through the enterocyte (26Weisiger R.A. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 2002; 239: 35-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar).In view of the available information regarding the broad binding specificity of L-FABP and the abundance of both I- and L-FABP in the enterocyte, it is possible that lipophilic drugs are solubilized and transported in the cytoplasm in a manner similar to endogenous lipophilic molecules. Since the optimal transport of fatty acids across the cytoplasm involves both I- and L-FABP types, it is likely that the solubilization and transport of exogenous hydrophobic ligands also involves both FABP types. This suggests that I-FABP also has the capacity to bind a diverse range of lipophilic ligands. Despite the extensive investigations into the binding selectivity of L-FABP, currently there is little information regarding the binding of non-fatty acid hydrophobic ligands to I-FABP. In fact other than one early report of the interaction of I-FABP with a range of chemical pollutants (18Kanda T. Ono T. Matsubara Y. Muto T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 168: 1053-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), the binding of I-FABP to exogenous ligands has been largely ignored.In this article we provide evidence that non-fatty acid lipophilic drug molecules are capable of binding specifically to rat I-FABP. We have employed competitive displacement fluorescence measurements in combination with NMR techniques to characterize the interaction between I-FABP and the lipophilic compounds bezafibrate, ibuprofen, nitrazepam, and 1-anilinonaphthalene-8-sulfonic acid (ANS) (Fig. 1). These data give substance to the potential role of FABPs as a mode of cytosolic transport for lipophilic drugs across the enterocyte. Knowledge of the structural determinants of drug binding to I-FABP provides the first step in defining the role of FABPs in drug absorption and transport. Such information could potentially lead to an improved understanding of the determinants of both oral bioavailability and intestinal metabolism and may prove to be a useful tool in pharmaceutical development.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Isotope-labeled ammonium chloride (15NH4Cl, >98% 15N) and deuterated water (2H2O, 99.9% 2H) were purchased from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories (Andover, MA). Isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was purchased from BioVectra (Prince Edward Island, Canada). Bezafibrate, ibuprofen, nitrazepam, diltiazem, ANS, myristate, and palmitate were obtained from Sigma. Escherichia coli strain BL21 Codon Plus (DE3)-RIL was purchased from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). All other reagents were of the highest purity available commercially.Expression and Purification of Rat I-FABP—The cDNA of rat I-FABP was isolated and ligated into the pTrc99 expression vector, and the recombinant protein was expressed in E. coli BL21 cells. Uniformly 15N-labeled I-FABP was biosynthesized in E. coli BL21 cells grown in M9 medium with 15NH4Cl as the sole nitrogen source according to the method of Marley (27Marley J. Lu M. Bracken C. J. Biomol. NMR. 2001; 20: 71-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar). Rat I-FABP was purified as described previously (28Lowe J.B. Sacchettini J.C. Laposata M. McQuillan J.J. Gordon J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 5931-5937Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Sacchettini J.C. Banaszak L.J. Gordon J.I. Mol Cell Biochem. 1990; 98: 81-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), with minor modifications to the protocol. Cells were lysed and nucleic acids removed by the addition of 0.1% (w/v) protamine sulfate. Following ammonium sulfate precipitation (60% saturation) the soluble protein fraction was desalted, and buffer was exchanged into 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl. This crude protein solution was applied to a MonoQ HR 10/10 column (Amersham Biosciences) in the same buffer, and I-FABP was eluted in the unbound fraction. The eluted fraction was concentrated, diafiltered into 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 (buffer A), and reapplied to the MonoQ column. I-FABP was eluted on a gradient from 0–1 m NaCl in buffer A. Bound fatty acid was removed from the protein using a Lipidex column. The homogeneity of the purified protein was assessed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2A, inset) and isoelectric focusing. Purity was characterized by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry on a Micromass Platform II liquid chromatography/quadrupole mass spectrometry system (Manchester, UK). Protein concentration was determined by UV-visible spectrophotometry using a molar extinction coefficient at 280 nm of 16,900 (cm m)–1 (14Richieri G.V. Ogata R.T. Kleinfeld A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23918-23930Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Fig. 2A, effect of increasing concentration of ibuprofen on ANS fluorescence. Fluorescence emission spectra of ANS-I-FABP in the presence of increasing concentrations of ibuprofen. The arrow indicates the direction of increasing ibuprofen concentration. All experiments were recorded with an excitation wavelength of 400 nm, and emission spectra were collected between 420 and 600 nm. Inset, silver-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gel of purified I-FABP. Left lane, purified I-FABP; right lane, molecular mass markers (kDa). B, displacement of ANS from I-FABP by lipophilic drugs. I-FABP (1 μm in buffer B) saturated with ANS (50 μm) was titrated against bezafibrate (▪), ibuprofen (▴), R-ibuprofen (♦), S-ibuprofen (○), nitrazepam (▾), diltiazem (•), palmitate (+), or myristate (*). Solid lines represent the optimal curve fitting of the data to a sigmoidal dose-response function by nonlinear regression.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fluorescence Measurements—Steady-state fluorescence spectra were measured on a Cary Eclipse fluorescence spectrophotometer (Varian, Mulgrave, Victoria, Australia). The binding of ANS to I-FABP was monitored by measuring the fluorescence signal between 420 and 600 nm following excitation at 400 nm. Slit widths were set to 5 and 10 nm for the excitation and emission monochromators, respectively. For the measurement of the ANS-I-FABP interaction, I-FABP (1 μm) in buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm EDTA) in a final volume of 1 ml was titrated with ANS (0–50.0 μm). The concentration of ANS was quantified by UV-visible spectroscopy at 350 nm using a molar extinction coefficient of 4,950 (cm m)–1. All measurements were performed at 20 °C; samples were allowed to pre-equilibrate for 2 min prior to measurement. Readings were corrected for dilution effects and nonspecific background fluorescence from probe only controls. The Kd and binding stoichiometry of the ANS-protein complex were determined by nonlinear regression and Scatchard analysis of the binding isotherms. The corrected ANS binding fluorescence data were fitted to a one-site binding model. ΔF=ΔFmax·[L]/(Kd+[L])(Eq. 1) ΔF represents the specific fluorescence enhancement upon the addition of ANS to a fixed concentration of I-FABP; Fmax is the maximum specific fluorescence enhancement at saturation; Kd represents the dissociation constant for ANS binding to I-FABP obtained from the concentration of ANS equivalent to half Fmax determined from the data fit; [L] represents the free concentration of ANS.The binding of various ligands to I-FABP was measured by displacement of bound ANS from the protein. The displacement data were analyzed as described previously (30Kane C.D. Bernlohr D.A. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 233: 197-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Briefly, I-FABP (1 μm, 1 ml) in buffer B was allowed to equilibrate with ANS (50 μm) for 2 min prior to fluorescence measurements. Freshly prepared drug solutions were made up in 5% (v/v) dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) in buffer B and titrated into the I-FABP-ANS sample. The displacement of ANS was measured as the corresponding loss of fluorescence and calculated as the decrease in area under the emission spectra between 420 and 600 nm following excitation at 400 nm. Fluorescence readings were corrected for dilution and for the intrinsic fluorescence of the ANS only control. Titration with 5% (v/v) Me2SO in buffer B alone produced no significant changes in fluorescence. The concentration of each compound required to displace 50% of the protein-bound ANS (I50) was determined by fitting the fluorescence data to a sigmoidal dose-response model, which assumes a single class of binding sites. % initial fluorescence=Fmin+(Fmax−Fmin)/(1+10((log I50−log[L])·HillSlope))(Eq. 2) I50 is the midpoint of competition and is defined as the concentration of displacer at which the maximum fluorescence intensity of the saturated ANS-I-FABP complex is reduced to 50% of the initial value. Fmin represents the maximum ANS displacement produced by the competitor and is defined by the bottom plateau of the displacement curve; [L] represents the concentration of the competitor. In the case of nitrazepam, the bottom plateau was not reached because of the low binding affinity and low aqueous solubility of the ligand. In this case the I50 was estimated from the slope of the fitted data curve (31Motulsky H. Christopoulos A. Fitting Models to Biological Data Using Linear and Non-linear Regression. A Pratical Guide to Curve Fitting. GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA2003Google Scholar, 32, Deleted in proofGoogle Scholar). The inhibition constants (Ki) for each compound were determined from the equation of Kane and Bernlohr (30Kane C.D. Bernlohr D.A. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 233: 197-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) as follows. Ki=[I50]/(1+[ANS]free/KdANS)(Eq. 3) KdANS represents the dissociation constant for the I-FABP-ANS complex. All data modeling operations were performed with GraphPad Prism version 4.0 software (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA) (31Motulsky H. Christopoulos A. Fitting Models to Biological Data Using Linear and Non-linear Regression. A Pratical Guide to Curve Fitting. GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA2003Google Scholar).NMR Spectroscopy—NMR experiments were carried out on Bruker DRX 500 spectrometer equipped with a triple resonance TXI cryoprobe. Two-dimensional 1H-15N heteronuclear single-quantum correlation (2D 1H-15N HSQC) spectra were recorded at 20 °C, with 1024 points and 128 increments. Data were processed using XWINNMR. Following linear prediction in the 15N dimension, the data were multiplied by Gaussian and sine-squared windows in 1H and 15N, respectively, and zero-filled to 2048 × 1024 points. Spectra were analyzed using the program SPARKY. 2T. D. Goddard and D. G. Kneller, unpublished work. The concentration of 15N-I-FABP ranged from 50 to 200 μm in buffer C (20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.8, 50 mm NaCl) prepared in 95% H2O, 5% D2O. Titrations were performed by adding microliter amounts of each test compound to the protein. The sample was mixed and allowed to equilibrate prior to data collection. Test compounds were prepared in either buffer C or Me2SO. Titration of up to 10% (v/v) Me2SO into the protein produced no significant chemical shift perturbations.Binding affinities were estimated from the NMR data by nonlinear least squares fitting of the change in chemical shift of binding site-specific residues (Ile58, Phe68, Phe93, Ala104, and Tyr117) as a function of added ligand concentration according to Equation 4 (33Li Y.

Kramer B. Lengauer T. Klebe G. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 261: 470-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (2339) Google Scholar) as implemented in Sybyl V6.91 (Tripos Inc., St. Louis, MO). The active site was defined as all residues with at least one atom within 10 Å of myristate in the crystal structure. The myristate and all crystallographic water molecules were ignored during docking. FlexX parameters were set to standard conditions, with sampling set to 400 partial solutions plus 100 × the number of ligand fragments. The top 30 structures as found using the FlexX scoring function were clustered using a 2-Å root-mean-square cut-off. The lowest energy structures were selected for comparison with the NMR data.Molecular Visualization—Molecular images were generated using the molecular visualization program, MOLMOL (35Koradi R. Billeter M. Wüthrich K. J Mol. Graph. 1996; 14: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (6469) Google Scholar). The structural coordinates for rat I-FABP-fatty acid (myristate) crystal complex were retrieved from the RCSB Protein Data Bank (www.rcsb.org/pdb) under the accession code 1ICM.RESULTSDisplacement of ANS by Non-fatty Acid Lipophilic Drugs— The effect of titrating 1 μm I-FABP with increasing concentrations of ANS was examined (data not shown). Nonlinear regression analysis of the binding data demonstrated that ANS bound to I-FABP with an apparent dissociation constant (Kd) of 7.4 ± 0.25 μm at 20 °C. Scatchard analysis yielded a stoichiometry of one ANS molecule per I-FABP in the complex. These findings are in agreement with previously reported values (36Kirk W.R. Kurian E. Prendergast F.G. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: 69-83Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 37Arighi C.N. Rossi J.P. Delfino J.M.

Proteins. 2003; 53: 607-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar).The affinity and specificity of I-FABP for the lipophilic drug molecules ibuprofen, bezafibrate, and nitrazepam were examined by employing a fluorimetric assay that utilized the displacement of the fluorescent probe ANS from the fatty acid binding cavity by a competing ligand. None of the displacing ligands absorbed at the emission or excitation wavelengths employed in the fluorescence assay, and therefore, no correction for inner filter effects was required. The assay was used to determine binding affinities for myristate and palmitate. The values obtained are presented in Table I and are in close agreement with reports from other laboratories (14Richieri G.V. Ogata R.T. Kleinfeld A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23918-23930Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 40Kurian E. Kirk W.R. Prendergast F.G. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3865-3874Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). This conformity demonstrates the accuracy and specificity of the fluorescence ANS displacement assay.Table IBinding affinity of I-FABP for various lipophilic drugs determined fluorimetrically by displacement of ANSLigandKiμmANS7.4 ± 0.25aThe value for ANS is the specific dissociation constant (Kd).Palmitate0.033 ± 0.008Myristate0.065 ± 0.0032Ibuprofen96 ± 1.8R-Ibuprofen63 ± 1.4S-Ibuprofen135 ± 4.0Bezafibrate60 ± 1.7Nitrazepam2300 ± 85DiltiazemNBbNB, no binding detected.a The value for ANS is the specific dissociation constant (Kd).b NB, no binding detected. Open table in a new tab The results of the competitive displacement experiments with each of the drugs are shown in Fig. 2, and the apparent inhibition constants (Ki) derived from these experiments are documented in Table I. Ibuprofen was examined both as a racemic mixture and as the two separate enantiomers. I-FABP displayed a higher affinity for the R-enantiomer of ibuprofen, and the Ki for the racemic mixture was an average of the Ki values derived for the individual enantiomers. These data reflect the fact that the assay measures displacement of ANS from the I-FABP binding cavity. When titrating two ligands that both displace ANS, the measured Ki value for the mixture reflects contributions from the separate Ki values of the individual ligands. Bezafibrate displayed an affinity similar to R-ibuprofen, whereas nitrazepam was found to be a weak competitor with a Ki value in the mm range. The binding affinity of the freely water-soluble drug diltiazem was also examined. Diltiazem showed no significant displacement of the ANS when titrated over the same concentration range as the lipophilic compounds (Fig. 2B).Based on the fluorescence displacement assay, it can be concluded that the binding affinity of these lipophilic drugs for I-FABP decreases in the order R-ibuprofen > bezafibrate > S-ibuprofen ≫ nitrazepam. The binding stoichiometry of each drug-I-FABP complex was determined by plotting the fluorescence intensity as a function of the drug:protein molar ratio (data not shown). A binding stoichiometry of one drug molecule per I-FABP was obtained for each drug. These data indicate that in addition to fatty acids, I-FABP is capable of binding structurally diverse non-fatty acid lipophilic drug molecules.Mapping of the Binding Surfaces by Two-dimensional 1H-15N HSQC Spectral Measurement—The solution structure of I-FABP has previously been determined both in the absence of ligand (apo-) and in the presence of palmitate (11Hodsdon M.E. Cistola D.P. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1450-1460Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 12Hodsdon M.E. Cistola D.P.

The structures of apo- and holo-I-FABP are broadly similar. A comparison of the amide chemical shifts in the 1H-15N HSQC spectra of apo- and palmitate-bound I-FABP reveals that a number of chemical shifts are perturbed upon fatty acid binding (11Hodsdon M.E. Cistola D.P. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1450-1460Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 12Hodsdon M.E. Cistola D.P.

Analysis of the I-FABP-palmitate structure reveals that the resonances that are most perturbed upon ligand binding are predominantly the backbone amides of residues that are located either within the binding cavity or at the dynamic portal region through which the ligand accesses the cavity. Thus, analysis of changes in the amide chemical shifts in the 1H-15N HSQC spectra provides a mechanism for"
https://openalex.org/W2082789114,"Activation of the transcription factor nuclear factor-κB (NFκB) by inflammatory cytokines like tumor necrosis (TNF) factor and interleukin-1 (IL-1) is generally associated with the induction of antiapoptotic pathways. Therefore, NFκB inhibits both intrinsically and extrinsically induced apoptosis and thus is regarded to act universally in an antiapoptotic fashion. Accordingly, activation of NFκB by IL-1 was shown to result in reduction of death ligand-induced apoptosis via up-regulation of antiapoptotic inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAPs). In contrast, apoptosis induced by ultraviolet-B radiation (UVB) was shown to be enhanced in an NFκB-dependent manner, indicating that NFκB can also act in a proapoptotic fashion. This study investigates the molecular mechanisms underlying IL-1-mediated enhancement of UVB-induced apoptosis. We show that NFκB activation in costimulation with UVB treatment results in repression of antiapoptotic genes and consequently in down-regulation of the respective proteins, like c-IAP, FLICE-inhibitory protein (FLIP), and some members of the TNF receptor-associated (TRAF)2 protein family. In parallel, TNFα is released, leading to activation of signaling pathways mediated by TNF receptor-1 (TNF-R1). Although TNF is well known to induce both proapoptotic and antiapoptotic effects, the down-regulated levels of TRAF-1, -2, and -6 proteins by IL-1 plus UVB action leads to a shift toward promotion of the proapoptotic pathway. In concert with the down-regulation of IAPs and FLIP, TNF-R1 activation as an additional proapoptotic stimulus now results in significant enhancement of UVB-induced apoptosis. Taken together, elucidation of the molecular mechanisms underlying IL-1-mediated enhancement of UVB-induced apoptosis revealed that NFκB does not exclusively act in an antiapoptotic fashion but may also mediate proapoptotic effects.

Activation of procaspase-8 can be antagonized by competitive binding of FLICE-inhibitory protein (FLIP) to FADD or by heterodimerization of FLIP with procaspase-8 (11Irmler M. Thome M. Hahne M.

Another way to prevent apoptosis is expression of inhibitors of apoptosis proteins (c-IAP), which interfere with activation of effector caspases (13Deveraux Q.L. Roy N. Stennicke H.R. van Arsdale T.

Baldwin Jr., A.S. Science. 1998; 281: 1680-1683Crossref PubMed Scopus (2562) Google Scholar).In contrast to TRAIL, TNFα is a weaker inducer of apoptosis but plays an important role in mediation of immune and inflammatory responses (15Baud V. Karin M. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 372-377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1360) Google Scholar). TNF-R1 triggers two different pathways upon TNFα binding, either a pro- or an antiapoptotic one (16Liu Z.G. Hsu H. Goeddel D.V. Karin M. Cell. 1996; 87: 565-576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1778) Google Scholar). Both pathways coexist in a certain balance, and each can be promoted depending on the physiological conditions. Either recruitment of FADD leads to induction of apoptosis, or recruitment of TNF receptor-associated factor (TRAF) proteins results in activation of the transcription factor NFκB, which mediates cell survival pathways (17Hsu H. Xiong J. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1995; 81: 495-504Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1734) Google Scholar, 18Hsu H. Shu H.B. Pan M.G. Goeddel D.V.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6716-6726Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Besides its important role in controlling immune function, cell proliferation, and differentiation, NFκB so far has mainly been described to induce expression of antiapoptotic genes (14Wang C.Y. Mayo M.W. Korneluk R.G. Goeddel D.V. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Science. 1998; 281: 1680-1683Crossref PubMed Scopus (2562) Google Scholar, 20Beg A.A. Baltimore D. Science. 1996; 274: 782-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (2925) Google Scholar). Therefore, NFκB has been designated a tumor-promoting molecule. Accordingly, NFκB was found to be constitutively up-regulated in a variety of tumor cells (21Bargou R.C. Emmerich F. Krappmann D. Bommert K. Maoaran M.Y. Arnold W. Royer H.D. Grinstein E. Greiner A.

Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 3468-3474PubMed Google Scholar). Consequently, inhibition of the NFκB-activating pathway is a major target for alternative anticancer drugs.Regarding the tumor selectivity of TRAIL, it has to be taken into account that tumor cells are generally surrounded by immune cells that constantly release proinflammatory cytokines like IL-1. Therefore, IL-1-mediated activation of NFκB may represent a pathway by which tumor cells can escape the cytotoxic effects of selective anticancer agents, like TRAIL. Accordingly, earlier work from our laboratory revealed that activation of NFκB by interleukin-1 (IL-1) resulted in reduction of TRAIL-induced apoptosis in transformed keratinocytes, which coincided with up-regulation of c-IAP-1 and c-IAP-2 proteins (24Kothny-Wilkes G. Kulms D. Pöppelmann B. Luger T.A. Kubin M. Schwarz T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29247-29253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The same was observed for CD95-induced apoptosis, supporting the assumption that NFκB protects from apoptosis universally. In contrast, apoptosis induced by UVB was shown to be significantly enhanced upon IL-1-mediated NFκB activation (25Kothny-Wilkes G. Kulms D. Luger T.A. Kubin M. Schwarz T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28916-28921Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). UVB-induced apoptosis is a complex process involving several pathways like induction of genomic DNA damage (26Kulms D. Pöppelmann B. Yarosh D. Luger T.A. Krutmann J. Schwarz T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7974-7979Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), ligand-independent clustering of death receptors (27Aragane Y. Kulms D. Metze D. Kothny G. Pöppelmann B. Luger T.A.

Oncogene. 2002; 21: 5844-5851Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). All three pathways contribute independently to the complete apoptotic response to UVB. Analyzing the molecular mechanisms underlying enhancement of UVB-induced apoptosis by IL-1 we observed pronounced down-regulation of c-IAP proteins (25Kothny-Wilkes G. Kulms D. Luger T.A. Kubin M. Schwarz T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28916-28921Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Even more importantly, costimulation with IL-1 resulted in strong release of TNFα, which additively induced apoptosis (25Kothny-Wilkes G. Kulms D. Luger T.A. Kubin M. Schwarz T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28916-28921Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), suggesting that, upon UVB exposure NFκB suddenly mediates effects that promote apoptosis. The present study was performed to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying IL-1-mediated enhancement of UVB-induced apoptosis. Additionally, we wanted to determine whether NFκB has the potential to mediate proapoptotic effects, because this may have important implications for photocarcinogenesis and for the potential use of NFκB inhibitors in the prevention and therapy of skin cancer.MATERIALS AND METHODSCells and Reagents—The human epithelial carcinoma cell line KB (American Tissue Culture Collection, Rockville, MD) was cultured in RPMI 1640 with 10% fetal calf serum. Stimulation of cells was carried out in colorless medium containing 2.5% fetal calf serum. For UVB irradiation a bank of six TL12 fluorescent bulbs (Philips, Eindhoven, The Netherlands) was used that emit most of their energy within the UVB range (290–320 nm) with an emission peak at 313 nm. Throughout this study a dose of 350 J/m2 was used. Control cells were subjected to the identical procedure without being exposed to UVB. To induce TRAIL-mediated apoptosis, 80 ng/ml of recombinant human TRAIL was added to the cells. This recombinant protein was N-terminally fused to a leucine zipper motif (lzTRAIL) to constitutively build the trimerized active form (49) and was obtained from Immunex Corp. (Seattle, WA). Recombinant human IL-1β (R&D Systems Inc., Minneapolis, MN) was applied in a final concentration of 10 ng/ml. The amount of TNFα secreted from cells was measured with an ultrasensitive TNFα ELISA (BioSource, Nivelles, Belgium). Activation of caspases was blocked by preincubating cells with 20 μm zVAD (Enzyme Systems Products, Livermore, CA) for 1 h. Plasmids constructed to overexpress TRAF-1, -2, -6, FLIP, and c-IAP, respectively, and the corresponding empty vector were kindly provided by Jürg Tschopp, Department of Biochemistry, University of Lausanne, Switzerland.Determination of Cell Death—16 h after stimulation cells were detached from culture dishes, and apoptosis was analyzed by a cell death detection ELISA (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Federal Republic of Germany). The enrichment of mono- and oligonucleosomes released into the cytoplasm of cell lysates is detected by biotinylated antihistone- and peroxidase-coupled anti-DNA-antibodies and is calculated according to the formula: absorbance of sample cells/absorbance of control cells. Unless otherwise stated, this factor was used as a parameter of apoptosis and is given as the mean ± S.D. of triplicates, representing one of three independently performed experiments. Throughout the experimental settings an enrichment of 1 corresponds to 5–7% apoptotic cells as determined by Annexin V staining followed by FACS analysis (data not shown).Analysis of Gene Expression Rates by GeneChip® Arrays—To screen KB cells for NFκB-dependent differential gene expression, GeneChip® array analysis was performed utilizing Human Genome U95Av2 chips (Affymetrix®, Santa Clara, CA). 1.5 h after stimulation total RNA was extracted by the phenol/chloroform extraction method utilizing phase lock tubes (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Federal Republic of Germany). 25 μg total RNA was subjected to first and second strand cDNA synthesis using T7-(dT24)-primer (MWG-Biotech, Ebersberg, Federal Republic of Germany) and enzymes from Invitrogen according to the protocol provided by Affymetrix®. Biotinylated cRNA was in vitro transcribed from 10 μg of cDNA utilizing the ENZO-kit from Affymetrix® and subsequently fragmented according to the manufacturer's recommendation (see technical manual: GeneChip® Expression Analysis, by Affymetrix®). Samples were analyzed using an Affymetrix® fluidic station 400 and a Affymetrix® 3000 Scanner with high density upgrade. The data were scanned and generated by the software MicroArray Suite 5.0 (MAS 5.0) from Affymetrix®. The signals were log transformed and calculated according to the statistical algorithms of the MAS 5.0, which calculates an intensity value and a detection call corresponding to “absent,” “present,” or “marginal” for each transcript (Affymetrix® User Manual). Furthermore, we used the software package Expressionist Suite (GeneData, Basel, Switzerland). The software package includes the Expressionist Refiner version 3.0.4. This allows an additional global quality control of the GeneChip® with detection and masking of defect areas on the chip and outliers, gradient correction of fluorescence signal, and regulation of variance.The statistical analysis was performed with the Expressionist Analyst version 4.0.5. Data were first normalized on a logarithmic mean of 210 in all experiments. We built groups with four experiments per group for the IL-1 stimulation and five experiments per group for the other stimulations and the control. Data were filtered for genes with valid values (expression over background respective a detection call “present” or “on” (see Affymetrix® User Manual) in 50% or more per group. For sample comparison, we calculated each stimulation group against the control group with n-fold regulation by comparing the mean and the p value by the Student's t test for statistical significance of the respective groups.Validation of Gene Expression Rates by Real-time PCR—3 h after stimulation, total RNA was extracted from KB cells by the phenol/chloroform extraction method utilizing phase lock tubes (Eppendorf). 3 μg of total RNA was reverse transcribed using a SuperScript™ II kit (Invitrogen). Assays-on-demand® were used to quantify gene expression of TRAF-1 (Hs00194638_m1), TRAF-2 (Hs00184192_m1), and TRAF-6 (Hs00371508_m1) (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Expression rates were normalized to the expression of the housekeeping gene glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Hs99999905_m1) using the TaqMan® Universal kit in an ABI Prism 7900HT Real-time PCR System supplied with SDS 2.1 software (Applied Biosystems). Expression rates were quantified using the 2–ΔΔCT method as described by Livak and Schmittgen (30Livak K.J. Schmittgen T.D. Methods. 2001; 25: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (119255) Google Scholar).Staining of Intracellular Proteins and FACS Analysis—6 h after stimulation cells (1 × 106) were removed from culture dishes, washed with PBS and fixed with 0.8% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 5 min on ice. After washing, cells were permeated with 0.3% saponin (Sigma) in PBS and incubated with the first antibody (20 μg/ml for TRAFs and 10 μg/ml for c-IAP and FLIP) overnight at 4 °C. Monoclonal mouse-anti c-IAP and anti-TRAF antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA): anti-c-IAP (N19, sc-1867), anti-TRAF-1 (H3, sc-6253), anti-TRAF-2 (H249, sc-7187), and anti-TRAF-6 antibody (H274, sc-7221). Polyclonal rabbit-anti-FLIP (556567, BD Pharmingen) was used. After washing, the respective secondary antibody (10 μg/ml donkey-anti-goat IgG, phycoerythrin (PE) labeled for c-IAP; 10 μg/ml goat-anti-mouse, PE labeled for TRAFs and bcl-2 and 20 μg/ml goatanti-rabbit IgG, PE labeled for FLIP) was incubated in 0.3% saponin for 30 min on ice. Subsequently, cells were washed in PBS and subjected to flow cytometry analysis in PBS with 0.03% saponin. FACS analysis was performed using an EPICS® XL-MCL flow cytometer (Coulter, Miami, FL). 20,000 cells were analyzed for each sample. Data analysis was performed by using the WIN/MDI 2.8 software program (Flow Cytometry Core Facilities, The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA).Transient Transfection of Cells—KB cells (8 × 106) were washed once with PBS and resuspended in 800 μl of ice-cold transfection buffer (140 mm NaCl; 5 mm KCl; 0.7 mm Na2HPO4; 6 mm glucose; 0.1 mm β-ME, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.0) containing 1.25% Me2SO (31Melkonyan H. Sorg C. Klempt M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4356-4357Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Cells were electroporated with 25 μg of the plasmids pRc-IκB-DN, pCR3-cFLIP, pCR3-c-IAP, pCR3-TRAF-1, pCR3-TRAF-2, pCR3-TRAF-6, or the respective empty vector. Transfection efficacy of cells cotransfected with a plasmid encoding β-galactosidase (pCMV-βgal, Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was determined 30 h later by staining cells with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolylβ-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal, 100 μg/ml) in 5 mm potassium ferricyanide, 5 mm potassium ferrocyanide, and 1 mm MgCl2 in PBS. Transfection efficacy ranged from 30 to 40%.RESULTSStimulation of cells from the epithelial cell line KB with TRAIL or irradiation with UVB induces apoptosis. IL-1 causes activation of the transcription factor NFκB, which is known to be responsible for the expression of a number of antiapoptotic genes. Accordingly, costimulation of cells with IL-1 resulted in reduction of TRAIL-induced apoptosis, as demonstrated previously (24Kothny-Wilkes G. Kulms D. Pöppelmann B. Luger T.A. Kubin M. Schwarz T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29247-29253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In contrast, costimulation with IL-1 caused a significant enhancement of UVB-induced apoptosis (Fig. 1A). This enhancement coincided with a strong release of the proapoptotic cytokine TNFα (∼100 pg/ml), whereas no TNFα was released upon stimulation with IL-1 alone or in combination with TRAIL (Fig. 1B). TNFα at 100 pg/ml does not induce apoptosis in KB cells itself. Addition of TNFα and of supernatants of IL-1 plus UVB-stimulated cells to UVB-irradiated cells only slightly enhanced UVB-induced apoptosis in comparison to an addition of IL-1 (Fig. 1C). This indicates that other intracellular mechanisms are responsible for intensifying the proapoptotic effect of TNFα that results in enhancement of UVB-induced apoptosis.IL-1-mediated activation of NFκB essentially requires phosphorylation of two specific Ser residues (Ser-32/36) of its cytoplasmic inhibitor IκB followed by ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. In the super-suppressor variant utilized in this experiment both Ser-32/36 had been substituted by Ala thereby preventing phosphorylation and degradation of IκB (IκB-DN). Cell death analysis revealed that in cells transiently transfected with IκB-DN the enhancing effect of IL-1 on UVB-induced apoptosis as well as its inhibiting effect of TRAIL-induced apoptosis was abolished, indicating NFκB to be critically involved in the underlying mechanisms (Fig. 2).Fig. 2Transfection of cells with a super-suppressor of IκB (IκB-DN) reverses the effects of IL-1 on UVB- and TRAIL-induced apoptosis. KB cells were transfected with a plasmid encoding a IκB-DN variant or with the empty vector. 30 h later cells were either left untreated or stimulated with IL-1 (10 ng/ml) alone, with IL-1 plus UVB (350 J/m2), or with IL-1 plus TRAIL (80 ng/ml). 16 h later apoptosis was measured using a cell death detection ELISA. The rate of apoptosis is reflected by the enrichment of nucleosomes in the cytoplasm shown on the y-axis (mean ± S.D. of three independently performed experiments).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We have previously demonstrated that NFκB mediates differential regulation of c-IAPs at the protein level depending on the apoptotic costimulus (25Kothny-Wilkes G. Kulms D. Luger T.A. Kubin M. Schwarz T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28916-28921Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). To expand on these findings and to further study transcription rates under these conditions, GeneChip® arrays were performed using cells stimulated with IL-1 alone or in combination with either TRAIL or UVB in comparison to untreated cells. Stimulation with IL-1 alone or IL-1 plus TRAIL resulted in a 16- to 18-fold up-regulation of antiapoptotic c-IAP mRNA and an up-regulation of antiapoptotic FLIP of ∼4-fold, respectively, but only a 2-fold up-regulation of TNFα. In contrast, stimulation with IL-1 plus UVB caused only a 3-fold up-regulation of c-IAP and down-regulation of FLIP, whereas the TNFα gene was 5-fold up-regulated (Table I).Table IIL-1 differentially influences the expression of either pro- or antiapoptotic genes, depending on the apoptotic costimulusView Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)* n-fold regulation was calculated for each stimulation group against the control group.§ Students t test was used to determine statistical significance of mean n-fold, reflected by the p value. Open table in a new tab When screening for other genes being differentially regulated by NFκB, we found genes encoding TRAF-1 and TRAF-6 to be critically down-regulated upon IL-1 plus UVB treatment (Table I). Because TRAF proteins are involved in TNF-R1 as well as IL-1R-mediated signal transduction, differences in their expression rates may influence signal transduction pathways triggered by the respective receptors, thereby influencing the fate of the cell.The results concerning the different expression rates of TRAF genes obtained from GeneChip® data were verified by real-time PCR (Table II). Accordingly, TRAF-1 was shown to be ∼16-fold up-regulated upon IL-1 or IL-1 plus TRAIL stimulation, whereas it was only 7-fold up-regulated in case of IL-1 plus UVB treatment, in comparison to untreated cells. TRAF-6 expression was only minimally influenced by different proapoptotic costimuli, but down-regulated by the combination of IL-1 plus UVB. The TRAF-2 gene, which was not included in the GeneChip®, was at least 2-fold up-regulated by IL-1 or IL-1 plus TRAIL, respectively, but 2-fold down-regulated by IL-1 plus UVB (Fig. 3). Taken together, IL-1-mediated up-regulation of TRAF-1, -2, and -6 genes remains unaffected by TRAIL treatment but is antagonized by UVB radiation.Table IIResults of real-time PCR experiments, showing that IL-1-mediated and NFκB-dependent expression of TRAF proteins is critically influenced by the apoptotic costimulusView Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)* ΔCT values were calculated by software algorithms of AB-protocols.

In this study, we show that at 42 °C and in the absence of TorD TorA is poorly matured and almost completely degraded. Strikingly, TorD restores TorA maturation to the same level whatever the growth temperature. In vitro experiments in which apoTorA was incubated with or without TorD at various temperatures confirm that TorD is an essential chaperone for TorA at elevated temperatures preventing apoTorA mis-folding before cofactor insertion.

The understanding of the mechanism of metalloprotein maturation is a challenge, because the insertion of a metal ion into a protein often requires complex pathways involving auxiliary proteins (for a review see Ref. 1Kuchar J. Haussinger R.P. Chem. Rev. 2004; 104: 509-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Maturation of molybdenum cofactor-containing proteins is a good example of this complexity, because it can involve cofactor escort proteins as well as specific chaperones (2Palmer T. Santini C.L.

Depending on the molybdoenzymes, the molybdenum cofactor (MoCo) 1The abbreviations used are: MoCo, molybdenum cofactor; TMAO, trimethylamine oxide; bis(MGD)Mo, bis(molybdopterin guanine dinucleotide)molybdenum; MPT-Mo, molybdopterin-molybdenum; ATPγS, adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate). can be a molybdopterin (MPT-Mo), a molybdopterin guanine dinucleotide (MGD), or a bis(MGD)Mo (4Mendel R.R.

Scrutton N.S. Subcellular Biochemistry: Enzyme-Catalyzed Electron and Radical Transfer. Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers, New York2000: 445-485Google Scholar). In Escherichia coli, TorA, a member of the Me2SO reductase family, is the main respiratory enzyme responsible for the TMAO reduction when the cells are grown anaerobically in the presence of TMAO (6Méjean V. Iobbi-Nivol C. Lepelletier M. Giordano G. Chippaux M. Pascal M.C. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 11: 1169-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). TorA is located in the periplasm and receives electrons from TorC, a pentahemic c-type cytochrome (7Gon S. Giudici-Orticoni M.T. Méjean V. Iobbi-Nivol C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11545-11551Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). TorA and TorC are encoded by the torCAD operon, which is induced in the presence of TMAO (6Méjean V. Iobbi-Nivol C. Lepelletier M. Giordano G. Chippaux M. Pascal M.C. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 11: 1169-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). TorA crosses the inner membrane by the TAT machinery in a folded state, meaning that the molybdenum cofactor is inserted into the apoprotein in the cytoplasm before translocation (8Santini C.L. Ize B. Chanal A. Muller M. Giordano G. Wu L.F. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 101-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). TorA has been used as a model protein for the study of both cofactor insertion and translocation. Recently, we established that TorA maturation is improved two to three times by the presence of the cytoplasmic TorD protein that proved to be the specific chaperone of TorA (9Pommier J. Méjean V.

Using in vitro assays containing purified apoTorA and a source of MoCo, we showed that TorD alone was sufficient to allow an optimal maturation of the enzyme (10Ilbert M. Méjean V.

A second role was also attributed to TorD during the translocation process of TorA by the TAT translocon to prevent export of immature TorA (12Oresnik I.J. Ladner C.L. Turner R.J. Mol.

During this proofreading mechanism, TorD binds the signal peptide of TorA and exhibits a quality control activity to ensure that only matured TorA is addressed to the TAT translocase. These two functions of TorD appeared independent, because it was clearly demonstrated that the action of TorD during TorA maturation is independent of the presence of the signal peptide (11Ilbert M. Méjean V. Iobbi-Nivol C. Microbiology. 2004; 150: 935-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Thus, TorD also binds to a second region of TorA in addition to the signal peptide (9Pommier J.

Among them, TorD from Shewanella massilia was crystallized, and its three-dimensional structure was solved revealing an all-helical architecture showing no similarity with other known protein structures (15Tranier S.

We and others have also shown that members of the TorD family are structurally related and contain mainly α-helices (11Ilbert M. Méjean V. Iobbi-Nivol C.

Although these proteins are part of the same family of chaperones, they probably possess a high specificity toward their partner. For instance, DmsD, a TorD homologue in E. coli, is necessary for the activity of molybdoenzyme DmsA (11Ilbert M. Méjean V. Iobbi-Nivol C.

In this study we show that although TorD is an accessory protein at 37 °C, it becomes essential for TorA maturation at elevated temperatures. This study also reveals that misfolded apoTorA is degraded in vivo and that TorD not only avoids apoTorA degradation but also plays a key role in the first step of TorA maturation.

Lepelletier M. Giordano G. Chippaux M. Pascal M.C. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 11: 1169-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). The strains were grown in Luria Broth medium, and, when necessary, ampicillin (50 μg·ml–1) was added to maintain plasmid selection. Plasmid pTorA allowing His6-tagged apoTorA production was previously described (10Ilbert M. Méjean V. Giudici-Orticoni M.T. Samama J.P. Iobbi-Nivol C. J. Biol.

To construct plasmid pBD, which allows the synthesis of His6-tagged TorD, the same cloning strategy as previously described for pTorD (11Ilbert M. Méjean V. Iobbi-Nivol C. Microbiology. 2004; 150: 935-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) was used except that the torD coding sequence was cloned into the EcoRI-HindIII cloning sites of pBAD24 (20Guzman L.M. Belin D. Carson M.J. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4121-4130Crossref PubMed Scopus (3978) Google Scholar). The absence of mutation in the DNA insert of the recombinant plasmid was checked by sequencing. Transformations were carried out according to the method of Chung and Miller (21Chung C.T. Miller R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 3580Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Preparation of the Soluble Fractions—Strains LCB514, LCB515, LCB515/pBAD24, and LCB515/pBD were grown overnight anaerobically at 37 and 42 °C with TMAO (0.2%) to induce chromosomal tor operon expression. The cells were resuspended in 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, washed twice, and disrupted by a French press. The extracts were centrifuged at 15,000 rpm, with the recovered supernatants then being centrifuged at 45,000 rpm to obtain the soluble fractions. The periplasmic and cytoplasmic fractions of strains LCB514 and LCB515 were prepared according to the sucrose-lysozyme-EDTA procedure as described previously (9Pommier J. Méjean V. Giordano G. Iobbi-Nivol C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16615-16620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Analytical Procedure—Protein concentrations were measured by the technique of Lowry. TMAO reductase activity was measured spectrophotometrically at 37 °C by following the oxidation of reduced benzyl viologen at 600 nm coupled to the reduction of TMAO (9Pommier J. Méjean V. Giordano G. Iobbi-Nivol C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16615-16620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The amount of TorA present in the extracts was determined by rocket immunoelectrophoresis. Samples were submitted to electrophoresis at 2 mA overnight in 4 × 4-cm (1%, w/v) agarose plates buffered with 20 mm sodium barbital (pH 8.6) containing TorA antibodies (20 μl). β-Galactosidase activities were measured by the method of Miller (22Miller J. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar) from strain LCB620 grown overnight anaerobically with TMAO (0.1%) at 25, 37, and 42 °C. Purification of Recombinant Proteins—Recombinant apoTorA protein was purified from the soluble extract of strain RK5208/pTorA grown aerobically at 30 °C in the presence of isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (1 mm). Recombinant TorD protein was purified from the soluble extract of strain LCB515/pBD grown aerobically at 37 °C in the presence of arabinose (0.2%). Both purifications were performed by HiTrap Chelating HP chromatography (Amersham Biosciences) as described previously (10Ilbert M. Méjean V. Giudici-Orticoni M.T. Samama J.P. Iobbi-Nivol C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28787-28792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). After purification, apoTorA and TorD were dialyzed against phosphate buffer pH 7 (20 mm). In Vitro Maturation System—ApoTorA (3 μm, 25 μl) and phosphate buffer, pH 7 (20 mm, 25 μl), or apoTorA (3 μm, 25 μl) and TorD (60 μm, 25 μl) mixed together were incubated for 30 min at 37, 42, and 47 °C before the addition of 100 μl of the MoCo source. The MoCo source corresponds to the soluble fraction of strain LCB440 grown anaerobically at 37 °C, prepared in 20 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7, at a protein concentration of 40 mg·ml–1 (10Ilbert M.

When ATP (1 mm) or ATPγS (1 mm and 5 mm) and MgCl2 (1 mm) were tested, they were added during the 30-min incubation of apoTorA in the presence or absence of TorD at various temperatures. The MoCo source is then added as mentioned above. All solutions were oxygen-depleted. After an incubation of 60 min at 37 °C the TMAO reductase activity was measured. Units corresponded to μmol TMAO reduced/min/μg of apoTorA. Defined in Vitro Assays—After the incubation of apoTorA (3 μm, 25 μl) or apoTorA (3 μm, 25 μl) and TorD (60 μm, 25 μl) for 30 min at 37, 42, and 47 °C as described above, the bis(MGD)Mo source was added. It was made up of MobA (0.4 μm), GTP (1 mm), MgCl2 (1 mm), and 96 μlof a solution containing MPT-Mo released from the heat-denatured supernatant (100 °C, 5 min) of mobA cells (10Ilbert M. Méjean V.

All these compounds were kept under a nitrogen atmosphere. After a 120 min-incubation at 37 °C the TMAO reductase activity was measured. Units corresponded to μmol of TMAO reduced/min/μg of apoTorA. TorD Is Required for TorA Maturation at High Temperature in Vivo—The TorA protein is fully produced when cells are grown in anaerobiosis in the presence of TMAO. In an earlier study, we showed that the loss of TorD does not abolish TorA maturation but decreases its level (9Pommier J. Méjean V. Giordano G. Iobbi-Nivol C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16615-16620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Indeed, ∼30–40% of the TMAO reductase activity was measured in a TorD– strain compared with a TorD+ strain when both were grown anaerobically in the presence of TMAO. Previously, the growths were routinely performed at 30 or 37 °C. To investigate further the role of TorD as a specific chaperone of TorA, we grew both the torD wild type (LCB514) and mutant (LCB515) strains at an elevated temperature. After overnight growth at 42 °C, soluble extracts were prepared, and the TMAO reductase activities were measured. As shown in Fig. 1A, the level of TMAO reductase activity measured in the soluble extract of strain LCB514 (TorD+) was similar when cells were grown at 37 and at 42 °C (2.2 and 2.3 units, respectively), indicating that the high temperature of growth does not affect TMAO reductase activity in the presence of TorD. In contrast, when cells of strain LCB515 (TorD–) were grown at 42 °C, the TorA activity was dramatically affected, because it was 19 times lower than that measured in the TorD+ strain grown in the same condition (0.12 instead of 2.3 units). As expected for growth at 37 °C, the absence of TorD led to ∼3 times less TMAO reductase activity (0.65 units compared with 2.2 units in the presence of TorD). To verify that the effect is only because of the absence of TorD in strain LCB515, the torD mutation was complemented by a plasmid (pBD) harboring the wild type torD gene. Strain LCB515 containing pBD and the control strain (LCB515/pBAD24) were grown in TorA-inducing conditions at 37 and 42 °C. A similar result was obtained because for growth at 42 °C, 16 times more TMAO reductase activity was measured when TorD was produced in trans, whereas at 37 °C, 3 times more activity was obtained in the presence of TorD. This point means that TorD is responsible for the increase of TorA maturation at elevated temperatures of growth. We also performed similar experiments at 25 °C. In this growth condition, the loss of TorD caused only two times less TMAO reductase activity (data not shown). We also checked whether the absence of TorD affected the subcellular location of TorA at high temperature. We observed that in the presence or in the absence of TorD, at least 60% of the TMAO reductase activity was found in the periplasmic fraction of cells grown at 42 °C. This point indicates that at high temperature and in the absence of TorD, the weak activity is mainly provided by a MoCo-containing TorA, which has translocated into the periplasm. Therefore, the absence of TorD does not abolish the translocation of mature TorA even at high temperature. These experiments clearly established that TorD is required for TorA maturation when cells are grown in drastic temperature conditions. In this case, the loss of TorD almost abolishes TorA activity. The essential role of TorD was confirmed by the inability of strain LCB515 (TorD–) to grow anaerobically at elevated temperature in minimal medium with glycerol as the non-fermentable carbon source and TMAO as the only terminal electron acceptor (data not shown). Altogether, these data indicated that TorD plays an essential role at elevated temperatures of growth and improves TorA maturation at lower temperatures. Furthermore, because it is now established that TorD is directly involved during TorA maturation (10Ilbert M. Méjean V. Giudici-Orticoni M.T. Samama J.P. Iobbi-Nivol C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28787-28792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), TorD could induce or stabilize the competent form of apoTorA at high temperature. Protective Role of TorD on apoTorA—The strong decrease of TMAO reductase activity observed for TorD– cells grown at 42 °C compared with 37 °C is either due to a drastic decrease of the amount of TorA or to the accumulation of inactive TorA protein. To discriminate between the two possibilities, we checked the amount of TorA protein from cells grown at 37 and 42 °C, and we also monitored the effect of the temperature on the torA expression level. To test whether temperature variations could affect the expression of torCAD, a chromosomal torA-lacZ fusion was used. Growths were performed in inducible conditions at 25, 37, and 42 °C. In the three conditions of temperature, the levels of β-galactosidase activity measured were similar (300–340 Miller units) meaning that the variations of temperature from 25 to 42 °C do not modify the level of torCAD expression. This result indicates that the changes in the TorA activity do not come from transcriptional effects. The amount of TorA present in the extracts was estimated by rocket immunoelectrophoresis using antibodies specifically raised against TorA (Fig. 1B). When strains LCB514 and LCB515 were grown at 37 °C, about one-third of TorA protein was recovered in the soluble extract of the TorD– strain compared with the TorD+ strain (Fig. 1B, tracks 1 and 3). Moreover, a similar amount of TorA was found in extracts of LCB514 grown at either 37 or 42 °C (Fig. 1B, compare track 1 with 2). Strikingly, in the soluble extract of strain LCB515 (TorD–) grown at 42 °C, only a very low amount of TorA was recovered, and the arc was at least 15 times smaller than that observed in both temperature conditions for the TorD+ strain (Fig. 1B, compare track 4 with tracks 1 or 2). TorA is thus strongly degraded at 42 °C in the absence of TorD. This effect agrees with the drastic decrease of the TMAO reductase activity and indicates that TorD protects the immature form of TorA directly or indirectly. Our proposal is that the presence of TorD stabilizes apoTorA to prevent misfolded state induced by the high temperature and devoted to proteolysis. Effect of Elevated Temperatures on the in Vitro Maturation of TorA—To test the effect of the temperature on apoTorA folding and the role of TorD in those conditions, we incubated apoTorA at various temperatures for 30 min in the presence or in the absence of TorD. We then added a MoCo source and incubated the mixture for 1 h at 37 °C to test the activation ability of apoTorA. The resulting TMAO reductase activity, which corresponds to the level of TorA maturation, thus reflects the amount of competent apoTorA in the sample. In a first set of experiments, apoTorA was incubated alone at 37, 42, and 47 °C for 30 min. The MoCo source was then added to each sample for 1 h at 37 °C. Fig. 2A shows a 13-fold activity decrease when apoTorA was incubated at 47 °C and an ∼3-fold decrease when apoTorA was incubated at 42 °C compared with the level of activity measured in the sample incubated at 37 °C. These data indicate that high temperatures also affect the in vitro maturation of TorA and strongly suggest that apoTorA is rapidly misfolded in these conditions leading to a significant decrease of its in vitro activation (Fig. 2A). In a second set of experiments, TorD was added to apoTorA during the incubation at 37, 42, and 47 °C. After 30 min of incubation, the MoCo source was added for 1 h at 37 °C, and the TMAO reductase activity was then measured. In contrast to what was obtained when apoTorA was incubated alone, in the presence of TorD the level of TMAO reductase activity remained constant at 37 and 42 °C and slightly decreased (1.7-fold) at 47 °C (Fig. 2A). As a consequence, when the temperature rises, the activity ratio measured in the presence or in the absence of TorD increased from 2 at 37 °C and 5 at 42 °C, up to 14 at 47 °C. These results indicated that TorD prevents the deleterious effects of elevated temperature on apoTorA probably by maintaining it in a competent state for maturation. Thus, our in vivo and in vitro experiments revealed that TorD possesses an essential role as a chaperone when apoTorA experiences elevated temperatures. For their activity, molecular chaperones usually require ATP as an energy source. To test whether the action of TorD toward apoTorA could be enhanced by ATP, ATP-Mg2+ (1 mm), or its non-hydrolyzable analog ATPγS (1 or 5 mm) were added during the 30 min-incubation period of apoTorA and TorD at 42 and 47 °C. We observed that the activities measured after the in vitro activation test were not modified by the presence of ATP or ATPγS and thus remained in the same range of values as those described in Fig. 2A (data not shown). As a control, a similar experiment was performed by incubating apoTorA at 42 and 47 °C for 30 min in presence of Mg2+-ATP (1 mm) or ATPγS (1 or 5 mm), and again no change was observed. These results strongly suggested that TorD does not require ATP to act as a chaperone toward apoTorA and to maintain it in a competent fold. By rocket immunoelectrophoresis using TorA antibodies, we have quantified the amount of mature and immature TorA present in the various samples tested for TMAO reductase activity. When apoTorA was incubated in the presence of TorD, the amount of immunoprecipitated protein was constant whatever the incubation temperatures were (Fig. 2B, tracks 4–6). When apoTorA was incubated alone, the amount of protein decreased slightly when the temperature increased (Fig. 2B, tracks 1–3). This result clearly shows that misfolded apoTorA is poorly degraded in our in vitro assays in contrast to what was observed in vivo, indicating that the role of TorD is not restricted to apoTorA protection against proteolysis but rather is to allow its correct folding. Maturation of TorA in an in Vitro Defined Assay—Using a defined assay, we have previously shown that TorD alone is sufficient to allow an efficient maturation of apoTorA at 37 °C (10Ilbert M. Méjean V. Giudici-Orticoni M.T. Samama J.P. Iobbi-Nivol C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28787-28792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In this defined assay, apoTorA or apoTorA and TorD were mixed with MPT-Mo provided from a heated mobA supernatant (100 °C, 5 min), GTP and the purified MobA enzyme, which catalyzed the conversion of MPT-Mo to bis(MGD)Mo. After 30 min of incubation of apoTorA or apoTorA and TorD at 37, 42, and 47 °C, we added the defined MoCo source for 2 h at 37 °C to allow the synthesis and the incorporation of the bis-(MGD)Mo. The results shown in Fig. 3 indicate that incubation of apoTorA alone at 42 and 47 °C leads, respectively, to a 2.5- and 23-fold decrease compared with the activity measured in the apoTorA sample incubated at 37 °C. This result confirms that at high temperature apoTorA is rapidly misfolded. In contrast, when apoTorA was first incubated with TorD, the activity recovered was similar at 37 and 42 °C and decreases 3-fold at 47 °C (Fig. 3). The ratio of the activity recovered in the presence or in the absence of TorD increases from 4 at 37 °C and 10 at 42 °C up to 25 at 47 °C. These results confirm the key role of TorD at high temperature, but the levels of activation are lower with the defined assay compared with that obtained with the supernatant fraction (compared Fig. 2A with Fig. 3). This difference results probably from the low amount of bis(MGD)Mo available in the defined assay (10Ilbert M. Méjean V. Giudici-Orticoni M.T. Samama J.P. Iobbi-Nivol C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28787-28792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In conclusion, using the defined activation assay, we demonstrated that TorD alone is sufficient to maintain apoTorA in a competent fold and to facilitate the MoCo insertion into the apoenzyme. However, as MobA was also present in the activation system, we cannot discard a putative role of MobA during the MoCo insertion in addition to its involvement in the last step of MoCo biosynthesis. Conclusion—This study reveals the essential role of TorD during TorA maturation at high temperature and leads us to propose the model shown in Fig. 4. High temperatures accelerate misfolding of apoTorA, which could not insert the MoCo and becomes sensitive to proteolysis in vivo. TorD counterbalances this deleterious effect by stabilizing or inducing the competent fold of the apoprotein, which then acquires the MoCo. Therefore, apoTorA seems to be in an unstable state between a competent and an incompetent form, and the TorD chaperone modifies this equilibrium toward the competent state, and, as a consequence, TorD also contributes indirectly to the protection of apoTorA assuming that competent apoTorA is not degraded. This study is the first description of the essential role of a molybdoenzyme-specific chaperone experiencing elevated temperatures, and this feature could be used as a powerful tool to study in details TorD involvement in both TorA maturation and translocation. It will be also very interesting to study whether this novel characteristic of TorD is shared by other members of this family of molybdoenzyme-specific chaperones. We thank M. Ansaldi and C. Jourlin-Castelli for fruitful discussions. We also thank Kevin Copp for reviewing the manuscript, L. Théraulaz for technical assistance, and A. Magalon for the kind gift of MobA protein."
https://openalex.org/W2027419223,"An uncharacterized yeast gene has been shown to encode a polyamine acetyltransferase and named PAA1. The recombinant Paa1 protein readily acetylates various polyamines such as putrescine, spermidine, and spermine. paa1 mutants are viable and grow normally under standard conditions. The mutants are sensitive to hydroxyurea, and they are synthetically temperature-sensitive with a rad53-21 mutation. The mutants also show genetic interactions with components of the transcriptional co-activator complex, SAGA, and partially suppress Spt– phenotypes of two spt mutants. These phenotypes suggest that acetylation of polyamines removes them from chromatin and makes the chromatin more accessible. It is known that spermine, but not acetyl spermine, is a precursor in the pathway for synthesis of coenzyme A in yeast. When Paa1 is overexpressed, leading to a lower level of spermine, cells show a growth dependence on either of two downstream compounds in the coenzyme A pathway, pantothenate or β-alanine.

This demonstrates that spermine and perhaps other polyamines are the in vivo targets of Paa1. Polyamines such as spermidine, spermine, and putrescine are positively charged small molecules that bind tightly to both RNA and DNA and also to some proteins (1Tabor C.W. Tabor H. Annu. Rev.

Although polyamines are abundant and ubiquitous components of all cells, relatively little is known about their function. In mammalian cells, there is a positive correlation between rapid growth and high levels of polyamines (4Meyskens Jr., F.L. Gerner E.W. Clin.

Furthermore, addition of growth factors to quiescent cells leads to a rapid induction of polyamine synthesis.Acetylation of polyamines appears to be necessary for their breakdown and export from cells (6Casero Jr., R.A. Pegg A.E. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 653-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Mammalian spermidine/spermine N1-acetyltransferase is a well-characterized cytoplasmic enzyme that catalyzes the rate-limiting step in polyamine catabolism by transferring the acetyl group from acetyl-CoA to the N1 position of spermidine or spermine (reviewed in Ref. 6Casero Jr., R.A. Pegg A.E. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 653-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Acetylated polyamines are exported from cells or metabolized by the constitutive flavin adenine dinucleotide-requiring polyamine oxidase (6Casero Jr., R.A. Pegg A.E. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 653-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). In addition to the cytoplasmic polyamine acetyltransferase, mammalian cells also have a nuclear enzyme of unknown function that acetylates the N8 amino group of spermidine (7Desiderio M.A. Mattei S. Biondi G. Colombo M.P. Biochem. J. 1993; 293 (Pt 2): 475-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Escherichia coli also has a polyamine acetyltransferase; it can acetylate both the N1 and the N8 positions on spermidine (8Fukuchi J. Kashiwagi K. Takio K. Igarashi K. J. Biol.

We were unable to find an obvious yeast homolog of either the bacterial or mammalian enzyme by investigation of the yeast genome. Therefore, we examined uncharacterized yeast genes that were members of the GNAT superfamily (12Neuwald A.F. Landsman D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 154-155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). This family includes histone acetyltransferases and other enzymes that acetylate amino groups on various proteins and even sugars. Here we describe a yeast gene that encodes a polyamine acetyltransferase.MATERIALS AND METHODSPlasmids—The PAA1 open reading frame (ORF) 1The abbreviation used is: ORF, open reading frame. was amplified from yeast genomic DNA by PCR and cloned into E. coli expression vector pET28a as an NheI-XhoI fragment to create pLBS12. This allowed expression of full-length Paa1 with a His tag at the N terminus. The protein was purified from E. coli extracts by Ni2+ affinity chromatography. It migrated as a 21-kDa protein on SDS-PAGE gels, consistent with its predicted molecular mass. It was dialyzed into 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, and stored at –80 °C after addition of glycerol to a final concentration of 10%.For expression of Paa1 from plasmids in yeast, a BamHI-HindIII PCR fragment was amplified from yeast genomic DNA, consisting of the PAA1 ORF plus 350 bp upstream and downstream of the ORF. This fragment was cloned into the CEN vector pRS315 to create pLBS23 and into the 2-μm vector pRS425 to create pLBS25. For overexpression in yeast, the PAA1 ORF was cloned as an EcoRI-XhoI fragment into a vector related to pRS423, behind the TEF promoter, to create pLBS21.Acetyltransferase Assays—The filter assay for polyamine acetyltransferase activity was essentially as described previously (13Morgan D.M.L. Morgan D.M.L. Polyamine Protocols. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ1998: 77-80Google Scholar). Reactions were carried out in 50 μl containing 3 mm polyamine, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 0.5 μCi of [3H]acetyl-CoA (5.6 Ci/mmol; Amersham Biosciences) with 0.5–1.0 μg of recombinant Paa1 enzyme. Reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 30 min and terminated by the addition of 10 μl of 1 m hydroxylamine. Samples were boiled for 3 min and centrifuged to remove precipitated protein. Whatman P81 paper filters (1 cm2) were spotted with 40 μl of the supernatants, and the filters were air dried and then washed four times with H2O and finally with 100% ethanol to remove any remaining [3H]acetyl-CoA. The filters were dried in an oven, and radioactivity was determined in a liquid scintillation counter.A paper chromatographic assay for polyamine acetyltransferase activity was also employed (15Tabor H. Tabor C.W. De Meis L. Methods Enzymol. 1971; 17B: 829-833Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The conditions were the same as those described above, except that the total volume was 25 μl, and 0.125 μCi of [1-14C]acetyl-CoA (57 Ci/mmol; Amersham Biosciences) was used. After centrifugation, 15 μl of the supernatant was spotted on Whatman No. 1 paper. Chromatography used a solvent consisting of 1-butanol/water/pyridine/glacial acetic acid (20:10:5:10) for 3–4 h. To visualize the compounds, the paper was sprayed with a ninhydrin solution (100 mg of ninhydrin + 70 ml of ethanol + 2.9 ml of 2,4,6-collidine + 21 ml of acetic acid). The paper was placed at 90 °C for 10 min so that the positions of the polyamines could be visualized. The paper was then exposed to film or a phosphorimager so that the amount of 14C-labeled acetylated polyamine could be determined. A phosphorimager was used to quantitate the results shown in Fig. 6B.The thin layer chromatography assay for tryptamine acetyltransferase activity followed the previously published procedure (16Ganguly S.

A phosphorimager was used to quantitate the results.Yeast Strains and Growth Media—The yeast strains used in this study are listed in Table I.

Landsman D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 154-155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar) were expressed in E. coli, and the recombinant proteins were purified and assayed for their ability to acetylate polyamines. One of them, the product of yeast ORF YDR071c, had robust activity and was able to acetylate putrescine, spermidine, and spermine (Fig. 1A). We called the gene for this protein PAA1 (polyamine acetyltransferase). Paa1 protein also acetylated N1- or N8-acetyl spermidine and N1-acetyl spermine, indicating that the enzyme could diacetylate polyamines (Fig. 1A). Diacetylation occurred with low efficiency, however. For example, putrescine was only monoacetyled under our standard assay conditions, but the diacetylated product could be detected if N1-acetyl putrescine was used as the substrate (Fig. 1B). The acetylation activity of Paa1 appeared to be specific for polyamines because the enzyme could not acetylate histones, nucleosomes, or the high mobility group-like proteins, Nhp6a, Nhp6b, Hmo1, Hmo2, or Abf2 (data not shown).Fig. 1Recombinant Paa1 has polyamine acetyltransferase activity.A, bar graph of activity with various polyamines, using the filter assay described under “Materials and Methods.” B, autoradiogram of a thin layer chromatogram showing activity of Paa1 with putrescine and less activity with acetyl putrescine.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In order to learn more about the function of Paa1, a mutant with a complete deletion of the ORF was constructed. The mutant was viable and grew at a normal rate at 25 °C, 30 °C, and 37 °C in both rich and synthetic medium and also in medium using galactose or glycerol as a carbon source. Many mutants in genes for HATs or other transcriptional co-activators are defective in transcription of the INO1 gene, leading to an inositol auxotrophy (18Pollard K.J. Peterson C.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6212-6222Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). However, the paa1 mutant grew on a medium lacking inositol. The mutant also had no silencing defect at the HM loci or the telomeres.The paa1 mutant was somewhat sensitive to hydroxyurea (Fig. 2A). This sensitivity was complemented by introducing a plasmid expressing Paa1 under its own promoter on either a CEN or a 2-μm plasmid (Fig. 2B). The sensitivity to hydroxyurea suggested that the paa1 mutant might be slightly defective in DNA replication. We therefore checked whether PAA1 would exhibit a genetic interaction with RAD53, a gene crucial for the S-phase checkpoint. Indeed, a paa1 rad53-21 double mutant was unable to grow at 37 °C, whereas both single mutants could (Fig. 3). Interestingly, a recent report describing a tandem affinity tag purification of Rad53-containing protein complexes identified Paa1 (at that time an uncharacterized product of ORF YDR071c) as a member of a Rad53 complex (19Ho Y.

Furthermore, it was previously demonstrated that polyamine depletion in yeast partially suppressed a gcn5 mutation, suggesting that polyamines play a role in repressing transcription (20Pollard K.J. Samuels M.L. Crowley K.A. Hansen J.C. Peterson C.L. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5622-5633Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Because acetylation of polyamines leads to their breakdown via oxidation by polyamine oxidase, at least in mammalian cells, we reasoned that a paa1 mutant would have more polyamines bound to chromatin and hence might be somewhat defective in transcriptional induction. As mentioned above, the mutant grew normally on rich or poor carbon sources, and it could grow in inositol-free medium, so it clearly did not have a major transcriptional defect. Several genetic interactions suggested that PAA1 does indeed play a role in transcription, however. Such interactions were observed with GCN5 and SPT8, genes for two proteins present in histone acetyltransferase complexes important for transcriptional activation. A paa1 gcn5 double mutant could not grow on rich medium at 37 °C, whereas each single mutant could (Fig. 4A). A similar interaction was observed with a paa1 spt8 double mutant; again, the single mutants could grow at 38 °C, whereas the double mutant could not (Fig. 4B). Gcn5 is a histone acetyltransferase present in several protein complexes important for transcriptional activation (reviewed in Ref. 21Carrozza M.J. Utley R.T. Workman J.L. Cote J. Trends Genet. 2003; 19: 321-329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). Spt8 is a component of one of these complexes, the SAGA complex. A genetic interaction was also observed with the SPT15 gene that encodes the essential general transcription factor TATA-binding protein. A paa1 spt15-21 double mutant was temperature-sensitive, whereas the single mutants grew normally at the high temperature (Fig. 4C).Fig. 4Synthetic temperature sensitivity of paa1 with various genes involved in transcription.A, paa1 gcn5 double mutant.

Dollard C. Winston F. Cell. 1989; 58: 1183-1191Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The paa1 derivative of FW942 had the same His– Lys+ phenotype as FW942, showing that the mutation does not cause a Spt– phenotype (Fig. 5). The paa1 mutation was able to partially suppress the Spt– phenotype of the spt15-21 and spt7-217 strains, however. These strains also have Ty1 δ insertions in the promoters of the HIS4 and LYS2 genes, causing a His+ Lys– phenotype (Fig. 5). Addition of the paa1 mutation causes each of the two strains to become Lys+ but remain His+ (Fig. 5). That is, the paa1 mutation suppressed the Spt– phenotype at the LYS2 locus but not at the HIS4 locus. This suppression of the lys2-173R2 δ insertion allele but not the his4 δ insertion is characteristic of weak suppressors of spt mutations. 2F. Winston, personal communication. In summary, the paa1 mutation partially suppresses the Spt– phenotype of two different mutants carrying the spt15-21 and spt7-217 alleles, respectively.Fig. 5Partial suppression of the Spt– phenotype of two spt mutations, spt7-217 and spt15-21. These two spt mutations cause a His+ Lys– phenotype in a strain with the appropriate Ty δ insertions (22Eisenmann D.M. Dollard C. Winston F. Cell. 1989; 58: 1183-1191Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The presence of the paa1 mutation leaves the His+ phenotype unchanged but causes a Lys+ phenotype. The plates were incubated at 30 °C for this experiment. Strains used were FW942 (SPT), FW1087 (spt7), FW1259 (spt15), and their respective paa1 derivatives, YLBS29, YLBS3, and YLBS30.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)While our work on Paa1 was in progress, a study was published reporting that this protein was a homolog of the mammalian arylalkylamine N-acetyltransferase that converts serotonin to acetylserotonin, a precursor of melatonin (16Ganguly S. Mummaneni P. Steinbach P.J. Klein D.C. Coon S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47239-47247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The authors reported that the recombinant yeast protein was able to acetylate arylalkylamines such as tryptamine and serotonin, and they suggested that the enzyme was an authentic arylalkylamine N-acetyltransferase. The specific activity was significantly lower and the substrate specificity was somewhat broader than that of the authentic mammalian enzyme, however. In view of this report, we compared the specific activity of the Paa1 enzyme on various polyamines versus tryptamine. As can be seen in Fig. 6, Paa1 indeed had significant ability to acetylate tryptamine, although the specific activity was some-what higher on polyamines, particularly putrescine.In view of these results we did an experiment to test whether polyamines, rather than arylalkylamines, were the true in vivo substrate for Paa1. It is known that spermine is oxidized in yeast by a polyamine oxidase that is the product of the FMS1 gene (17White W.H. Gunyuzlu P.L. Toyn J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10794-10800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 23Landry J. Sternglanz R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 303: 771-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 24Chattopadhyay M.K. Tabor C.W. Tabor H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 13869-13874Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). One of the products of the oxidation is 3-aminopropanal, which is then converted to β-alanine. The β-alanine is a precursor of pantothenate, which is in turn a precursor of coenzyme A. In yeast, this is the major pathway for synthesizing coenzyme A, and thus fms1 mutants require β-alanine or pantothenate for growth (17White W.H. Gunyuzlu P.L. Toyn J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10794-10800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) (Fig. 7A). When we introduced a multicopy plasmid overexpressing Paa1 from a strong promoter into yeast, there was a significant inhibition of growth on a medium lacking pantothenate (Fig. 7B). This inhibition was only seen on medium lacking pantothenate and not on rich or synthetic complete medium. In contrast, when β-alanine was added to the medium lacking pantothenate, not only was an fms1 mutant able to grow (as expected), but the growth of the wild-type strain with the Paa1-overproducing plasmid was greatly improved. That is, overproduction of Paa1 in the cell greatly inhibited growth, but only in medium lacking pantothenate or β-alanine.Our interpretation of these results is that when there is excess Paa1 in the cell, more putrescine, spermidine, and spermine are acetylated, leading to a lower amount of spermine in the cell (Fig. 7A). Most of the polyamines and their acetylated derivatives can be oxidized by Fms1, but only spermine oxidation yields 3-aminopropanal, the precursor of β-alanine and hence coenzyme A (17White W.H. Gunyuzlu P.L. Toyn J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10794-10800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 23Landry J. Sternglanz R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 303: 771-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The depletion of spermine by excess Paa1 leads to the growth defect seen in the absence of β-alanine or pantothenate. This experiment provides strong evidence that spermine is an in vivo substrate of Paa1.We also tried a more direct experiment to test whether Paa1 acetylated spermine in vivo. We exposed yeast cells to [14C]spermine for 16 h, extracted polyamines, and looked for [14C]acetyl spermine by thin layer chromatography. We compared PAA1 and paa1 strains, both with spe4 and fms1 mutations. Spe4 catalyzes the final step in spermine synthesis, and Fms1 breaks down spermine (Fig. 7A), and thus a strain lacking those enzymes should increase the intracellular specific activity of the [14C]spermine. Nevertheless, we were unable to detect any [14C]acetyl spermine in the wild-type PAA1 strain, even when it was carrying the multicopy plasmid overexpressing PAA1 described above (Fig. 7B). Another laboratory also has been unable to detect intracellular acetyl spermine in yeast. 3H. Tabor, personal communication. The concentration of acetyl spermine is also very low in mammalian cells (25Wallace H.M. Fraser A.V. Hughes A. Biochem. J. 2003; 376: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar). It must either be rapidly broken down or secreted from the cell.DISCUSSIONAlthough the genes for polyamine acetyltransferases had been identified in both mammalian cells and bacteria, no obvious homolog was apparent in the yeast genome. We therefore examined uncharacterized members of the GNAT superfamily, consisting of various N-acetyltransferases, to find one that acetylated polyamines. The product of yeast ORF YDR071c clearly had such an activity (Fig. 1) and hence was named PAA1. The Paa1 protein acetylates putrescine, spermidine, and spermine in vitro. It also can acetylate the monoacetylated derivatives of these compounds, leading to the diacetylated products (Fig. 1). It is not clear whether all or only some of these polyamines are in vivo substrates, but, as discussed below, spermine definitely is a substrate.Are spermine and other polyamines the only in vivo substrates of Paa1? The recombinant enzyme could not acetylate histones or various small basic proteins associated with chromatin, suggesting that proteins are not substrates. However, as described above, while our work on PAA1 was under way, a report was published that the recombinant protein acetylated aryalkylamines such as tryptamine and serotonin (16Ganguly S. Mummaneni P. Steinbach P.J. Klein D.C. Coon S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47239-47247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). We were able to confirm this observation (Fig. 6). However, the experiment shown in Fig. 7 strongly suggests that Paa1 acts on polyamines in vivo. In yeast, the pathway for the biosynthesis of coenzyme A involves the oxidation of spermine to 3-aminopropanal and spermidine by Fms1, followed by the conversion of 3-aminopropanal to β-alanine (17White W.H. Gunyuzlu P.L. Toyn J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10794-10800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The β-alanine is a precursor of pantothenate, which in turn is a precursor of coenzyme A (Fig. 7A). Overexpression of Paa1 would be expected to cause a decrease in the concentration of unacetylated spermine and hence lead to less coenzyme A. Indeed, that is what was observed. The overexpression plasmid led to growth inhibition in a medium lacking pantothenate, but not in rich media that have large amounts of polyamines and pantothenate. This growth inhibition could be reversed by adding pantothenate or β-alanine to the medium (Fig. 7B). These results indicate that spermine is a substrate of Paa1 in yeast, and perhaps other polyamines are also substrates.We think it is unlikely that arylalkylamines are in vivo substrates of Paa1. First, there is no evidence that serotonin exists in yeast. Furthermore, there are no homologs in yeast of the two mammalian enzymes that convert tryptophan to tryptamine and then to serotonin. Thus, there is no reason to think that yeast needs an arylalkylamine acetyltransferase. The in vitro activity of Paa1 on arylalkylamines is probably due to the similarity of the ethyl amine moiety present on arylalkylamines to the propyl and butyl amines present on polyamines.Polyamines bind strongly to nucleic acids through electrostatic interactions and are thought to condense chromatin through these interactions (26Raspaud E. Chaperon I. Leforestier A. Livolant F. Biophys. J. 1999; 77: 1547-1555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The effects of polyamines on chromatin are likely to be complicated, however. For example, in vitro studies show that histone acetylation of nucleosomes, generally associated with open chromatin and transcriptional activation, is stimulated by low concentrations of polyamines but inhibited at high concentrations of polyamines (27Dod B. Kervabon A. Parello J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 121: 401-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The interpretation of this result is that at low concentrations, the polyamines compete with the binding of the histone N-terminal tails to DNA in chromatin, thus freeing the tails for acetylation. Thus, binding of polyamines to chromatin may, under some circumstances, actually open the chromatin instead of condensing it.Evidence for a role in transcriptional repr"

Here we examined whether probucol could protect against endothelial dysfunction induced by the two-electron oxidant HOCl. Hypochlorous acid eliminated endothelium-dependent relaxation of rabbit aorta, whereas endothelial function and tissue cGMP was preserved and elevated, respectively, in animals pretreated with probucol. Exogenously added probucol also protected against HOCl-induced endothelial dysfunction. In vitro, HOCl oxidized probucol in a two-phase process with rate constants k1 = 2.7 ± 0.3 × 102 and k2 = 0.7 ± 0.2 × 102 m–1 s–1 that resulted in a dose- and time-dependent accumulation of probucol-derived disulfoxide, 4,4′-dithiobis(2,6-di-tert-butyl-phenol) (DTBP), DTBP-derived thiosulfonate, disulfone, and sulfonic acid, together with 3,3′,5,5′-tetra-tert-butyl-4,4′-diphenoquinone (DPQ) as determined by high performance liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry. Like HOCl, selected one-electron oxidants converted probucol into DTBP and DPQ. Also, dietary and in vitro added DTBP protected aortic rings from HOCl-induced endothelial dysfunction and in vitro oxidation by HOCl gave rise to the thiosulfonate, disulfone, and sulfonic acid intermediates and DPQ. However, the product profiles of the in vitro oxidation systems were different from those in aortas of rabbits receiving dietary probucol or DTBP ± HOCl treatment. Together, the results show that both probucol and DTBP react with HOCl and protect against HOCl-induced endothelial dysfunction, although direct scavenging of HOCl is unlikely to be responsible for the vascular protection by the two compounds.

Atherosclerosis and its associated pathological conditions are characterized by abnormal •NO 1The abbreviations used are: •NO, nitric oxide; AAPH, 2,2′-azobis(2-amidino-propane)hydrochloride; BP, 3,3′,5,5′-tetra-tert-butyl-4,4′-bisphenol; cGMP, guanosine 3′,5′-cyclic monophosphate; DPQ, 3,3′,5,5′-tetra-tert-butyl-4,4′-diphenoquinone; DTBP, 4,4′-dithiobis(2,6-di-tert-butyl-phenol); HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; HOCl, hypochlorous acid; MS, mass spectrometry; TOF, time-of-flight; 1e, one-electron; 2e, two-electron. 1The abbreviations used are: •NO, nitric oxide; AAPH, 2,2′-azobis(2-amidino-propane)hydrochloride; BP, 3,3′,5,5′-tetra-tert-butyl-4,4′-bisphenol; cGMP, guanosine 3′,5′-cyclic monophosphate; DPQ, 3,3′,5,5′-tetra-tert-butyl-4,4′-diphenoquinone; DTBP, 4,4′-dithiobis(2,6-di-tert-butyl-phenol); HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; HOCl, hypochlorous acid; MS, mass spectrometry; TOF, time-of-flight; 1e, one-electron; 2e, two-electron. bioactivity, such that vasodilatation in response to agonists for endothelium-derived •NO release such as acetylcholine is impaired or replaced by constriction (1Ludmer P.L.

Endothelial dysfunction has been directly demonstrated in atherosclerotic human coronary arteries (1Ludmer P.L. Selwyn A.P. Shook T.L. Wayne R.R. Mudge G.H. Alexander R.W. Ganz P. N. Engl. J. Med. 1986; 315: 1046-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (2018) Google Scholar), and there is strong evidence that its presence predicts the occurrence of clinical events in patients with atherosclerosis (2Gokce N. Keaney Jr., J.F. Hunter L.M. Watkins M.T. Nedeljkovic Z.S. Menzoian J.O. Vita J.A. J. Am. Coll. Cardiol. 2003; 41: 1769-1775Crossref PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar). Oxidative events are thought to play an important role in endothelial dysfunction. For example, in animal models of atherosclerosis and hypercholesterolemia, vascular production of superoxide anion radical is increased (3Ohara Y. Peterson T.E. Harrison D.G. J. Clin. Investig. 1993; 91: 2546-2551Crossref PubMed Scopus (1642) Google Scholar), and this abnormality can decrease •NO bioactivity via the formation of peroxynitrite (4Beckman J.S. Beckman T.W. Chen J. Marshall P.A. Freeman B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1620-1624Crossref PubMed Scopus (6677) Google Scholar) that itself can inactivate endothelial nitric-oxide synthase (5Zou M.H. Shi C. Cohen R.A. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 109: 817-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). Later stages of atherosclerosis, however, are more complex, and reactive species other than superoxide anion radical likely contribute to endothelial dysfunction (6Miller Jr., F.J. Gutterman D.D. Rios C.D. Heistad D.D. Davidson B.L. Circ. Res. 1998; 82: 1298-1305Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). In this context, myeloperoxidase is of particular interest, as it is present and active in human atherosclerotic lesions (7Daugherty A. Dunn J.L. Rateri D.L. Heinecke J.W. J. Clin. Investig. 1994; 94: 437-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (1123) Google Scholar), often associates closely with endothelial cells (8Baldus S. Eiserich J.P. Mani A. Castro L. Figueroa M. Chumley P. Ma W.

White C.R. Freeman B.A. Science. 2002; 296: 2391-2394Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar). In addition, hypochlorous acid (HOCl), the major product of myeloperoxidase under physiologic conditions, may contribute to endothelial dysfunction in atherosclerosis (12Zhang R. Brennan M.L. Fu X. Aviles R.J. Pearce G.L. Penn M.S. Topol E.J. Sprecher D.L. Hazen S.L. J. Am. Med. Assoc. 2001; 286: 2136-2142Crossref PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar). There is evidence that HOCl-mediated oxidation occurs within and outside endothelial cells of human atherosclerotic lesions, based on immunostaining with a monoclonal antibody specific for HOCl-modified proteins (13Hazell L.J. Arnold L. Flowers D. Waeg G. Malle E. Stocker R. J. Clin. Investig. 1996; 97: 1535-1544Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). Also, HOCl-modified low density lipoprotein, present in human lesions (13Hazell L.J. Arnold L. Flowers D. Waeg G. Malle E. Stocker R. J. Clin. Investig. 1996; 97: 1535-1544Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar), can inhibit •NO production by endothelial cells (14Nuszkowski A. Grabner R. Marsche G. Unbehaun A. Malle E. Heller R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14212-14221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), and HOCl-mediated chlorination of l-arginine can produce a similar defect in endothelial cell •NO synthesis (15Zhang C. Reiter C. Eiserich J.P. Boersma B. Parks D.A. Beckman J.S. Barnes S. Kirk M. Baldus S. Darley-Usmar V.M. White C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27159-27165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Furthermore, HOCl impairs endothelial function by decreasing the stability of endothelial nitric-oxide synthase (16Stocker R. Huang A. Jeranian E. Hou J.Y. Wu T. Thomas S.R. Keaney Jr., J.F. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2004; 24: 2028-2033Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). At present, little is known on how different antioxidants impact HOCl-induced endothelial dysfunction. Among the antioxidants relevant to cardiovascular disease, probucol is of particular interest, as it inhibits atherosclerosis in hypercholesterolemic rabbits (17Kita T. Nagano Y. Yokode M. Ishii K.

A. 2003; 100: 7283-7288Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Probucol also reverses established plaques in rabbits (22Nagano Y. Nakamura T. Matsuzawa Y. Cho M. Ueda Y. Kita T. Atherosclerosis. 1992; 92: 131-140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) and xanthomas in humans (23Kajinami K. Nishitsuji M. Takeda Y. Shimizu M. Koizumi J. Mabuchi H. Atherosclerosis. 1996; 120: 181-187Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and it effectively inhibits intimal thickening and restenosis in rabbits (24Ferns G.A.A. Forster L. Steward-Lee A. Konneh M. Nourooz-Zadeh J. Δnggård E.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11312-11316Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), pigs (25Schneider J.E. Berk B.C.

Lespérance J. Bourassa M. Lambert J. Doucet S. Bilodeau L. Nattel S. de Guise P. N. Engl. J. Med. 1997; 337: 365-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). Interestingly, probucol preserves endothelial function in cholesterol-fed rabbits (27Keaney Jr., J.F. Xu A. Cunningham D. Jackson T. Frei B. Vita J.A. J. Clin. Investig. 1995; 95: 2520-2529Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar) and, when given in conjunction with a lipid-lowering drug, also improves endothelium-dependent vasodilation in humans with coronary artery disease (28Anderson T.J. Meredith I.T. Yeung A.C. Frei B. Selwyn A.P. Ganz P. N. Engl. J. Med. 1995; 332: 488-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (1101) Google Scholar), although the underlying mechanisms for this protective activity remain unclear. The aim of the present study therefore was to examine whether probucol protects against HOCl-induced endothelial dysfunction. Materials—Probucol was obtained from Jucker Pharma (Stockholm, Sweden), and 3,3′,5,5′-tetra-tert-butyl-4,4′-bisphenol (BP), 4,4′-dithiobis(2,6-di-tert-butyl-phenol) (DTBP), and (2,2′-azobis(2-amidinopropane)-hydrochloride (AAPH) were obtained from Polysciences (Warrington, PA). Authentic 3,3′,5,5′-tetra-tert-butyl-4,4′-diphenoquinone (DPQ) was prepared from BP (29Pelter A. Elgendy S. Tetrahedron Lett. 1988; 29: 677-680Crossref Scopus (166) Google Scholar) and purified by gradient reversed-phase HPLC (see below). Acetylcholine, lead dioxide, and ceric ammonium nitrate (purity 98%, a source of Ce4+) were obtained from Sigma. Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (Sigma) was prepared from nanopure water and stored over Chelex-100® (Bio-Rad) at 4 °C for 24 h to remove contaminating transition metals. All other reagents were of the highest quality available. Buffers were routinely filtered, argon-flushed, and stored at 4 °C prior to use. Solutions of HOCl were prepared freshly before use by diluting reagent HOCl (Aldrich) into phosphate buffer (250 mm, pH 7.0) and standardizing with ϵ235 nm ∼ 100 m–1 cm–1 (hypochlorous acid) and ϵ290 nm ∼ 300 m–1 cm–1 (hypochlorite) (30Morris J.C. J. Phys. Chem. 1966; 70: 3798-3805Crossref Scopus (803) Google Scholar). Animals—New Zealand White rabbits (2.5–3 kg) were obtained from a commercial farm (Wauchope, NSW Australia) and housed individually for the entire study period. Rabbits received normal chow (control) or chow supplemented with probucol (1%, w/w), DTBP (0.2%), or BP (0.02%) as described previously (31Lau A.K. Leichtweis S.B. Hume P. Mashima R. Hou J.Y. Chaufour X. Wilkinson B. Hunt N.H. Celermajer D.S. Stocker R. Circulation. 2003; 107: 2031-2036Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar); these concentrations resulted in comparable drug levels in the aortas of supplemented animals. Feed and water were provided ad libitum for a period of 4 weeks judged to be sufficient time for circulating drug levels to reach a maximum (data not shown). Animals were weighed weekly; mean body weights did not differ between treatment groups. The local ethics committee approved the study. Vascular Reactivity—Perfused rabbit aortas were harvested and vascular reactivity studies performed as described (31Lau A.K. Leichtweis S.B. Hume P. Mashima R. Hou J.Y. Chaufour X. Wilkinson B. Hunt N.H. Celermajer D.S. Stocker R. Circulation. 2003; 107: 2031-2036Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Briefly, within 2 h of isolation, ring segments ∼5 mm in length were mounted in a myobath system (World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL) containing 20 ml of Krebs solution aerated at 37 °C with 5% CO2(g), and the dilatory response of half-maximally norepinephrine preconstricted rings to incremental doses of acetylcholine (10–9-10–5 mol/liter) was determined. Where indicated, reagent HOCl (final concentration 400 μm) was added to the Krebs solution, and the rings were incubated for 5 min prior to thorough washing, preconstriction, and assessment of vessel relaxation. In some studies rings were incubated with probucol or DTBP for 10 min, washed thoroughly, and then exposed to HOCl prior to assessing endothelium-dependent relaxation. A maximum of three consecutive sequences of constriction/relaxation were performed for each ring. Preparation of Aortic Homogenates—Aortic rings used in the vascular function studies were removed and immediately cut into small pieces, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and then pulverized and homogenized as described (32Suarna C. Dean R.T. May J. Stocker R. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1995; 15: 1616-1624Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 33Witting P.K. Pettersson K. Östlund-Lindqvist A.-M. Westerlund C. Wågberg M. Stocker R. J. Clin. Investig. 1999; 104: 213-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). An aliquot (50 μl) of homogenate was removed for protein determination (BCA assay, Sigma), and the remainder was extracted into methanol/hexane (5:1, v/v) (33Witting P.K. Pettersson K. Östlund-Lindqvist A.-M. Westerlund C. Wågberg M. Stocker R. J. Clin. Investig. 1999; 104: 213-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), the resulting hexane fraction was dried, and the residue was suspended in isopropanol for analysis of probucol and its oxidation products. For cGMP determinations, aortic segments were treated with vehicle (control) or HOCl (400 μm) before the addition of 1 μm acetylcholine in the presence of 200 μm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine and measurement of cGMP in the homogenate using a kit (Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI). Probucol Oxidation Studies—Probucol is a highly lipophilic compound (partition coefficient between octanol and water = 10 versus 10.8 for octanol) (34Hattori Y. Kawakami S. Yamashita F. Hashida M. J. Controlled Release. 2000; 69: 369-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) that readily distributes into lipoproteins. To mimic the biological situation, oxidation reactions were therefore performed with probucol (or DTBP) dissolved in hexane (2 ml) to which aliquots of HOCl were added to give the final concentrations indicated. The heterogeneous mixtures were shaken vigorously at 37 °C for 60 min and then placed on ice after adding 1 ml of water. The hexane phase was removed, dried under vacuum, and resuspended in isopropanol (200 μl) for HPLC analyses. The aqueous phase was analyzed for the content of sulfate anion (SO42−) by ion exchange chromatography. Analytical Analyses—Probucol, DTBP, BP, and DPQ were analyzed by gradient reversed-phase HPLC (33Witting P.K. Pettersson K. Östlund-Lindqvist A.-M. Westerlund C. Wågberg M. Stocker R. J. Clin. Investig. 1999; 104: 213-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 35Witting P.K. Pettersson K. Östlund-Lindqvist A.-M. Westerlund C. Westin Eriksson A. Stocker R. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 667-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) and quantified by peak area comparison with authentic standards. Under the conditions used, BP, DTBP, probucol, and DPQ eluted at 12.5, 19.4, 20.8, and 29.2 min, respectively. Other oxidation products resolved by this HPLC system were also quantified by peak area comparison, using analytically pure samples obtained from semipreparative (LC-18, 20 mm × 25 cm, 5 μm) fractionation of the reaction mixture. Isolated samples were dried under vacuum, redissolved to a known concentration, and assessed for purity by analytical HPLC (LC-18, 4.6 mm × 25 cm, 5 μm) in combination with mass spectrometry (see below). The accumulation of DPQ was monitored at 420 nm, whereas all other products were monitored at 270 nm. Where required, 1H NMR (Bruker 600 MHz NMR spectrometer fitted with a standard hydrogen probe) was performed using authentic samples of DTBP and analytically pure DTBP isolated by HPLC after oxidation of probucol with HOCl. Ion exchange chromatography was performed on a Waters IC PAK-A column (4.6 × 50 mm × 10 μm) with an eluent containing sodium gluconate (0.32 g/liter), boric acid (0.36 g/liter), sodium tetraborate decahydrate (0.5 g/liter), glycerol (5.0 ml/liter), n-butanol (20 ml/liter), and acetonitrile (120 ml/liter) at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min. Eluting anions were detected with a refractive index detector (limit of detection 10 μm), with a sulfate anion eluting at ∼18 min identified by comparison with an authentic standard. Mass Spectrometry—Product masses were determined using electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (MS). Spectra were acquired using an API QStar Pulsar i hybrid tandem mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Samples (∼10 pmol, 1 μl) were dissolved in water/acetonitrile (1:4, v/v) and loaded into nanospray needles (Proxeon, Denmark), and the tip was positioned ∼10 mm from the orifice. Nitrogen was used as the curtain gas, and a potential of –800 V was applied to the needle. A TOF MS scan was acquired (m/z 50–2000, 1 s) and accumulated for ∼1 min into a single file. Precursor masses determined from TOF MS scans were selected by Q1 for a MS-MS analysis. Nitrogen was used as the collision gas, and a collision energy was chosen that reduced the intensity of the precursor ion by ∼95%. Tandem mass spectra were accumulated into a single file for ∼2 min (m/z 50–1250). Kinetic Measurements—Kinetic determinations for the reactions of probucol and DTBP with HOCl were performed with an Applied Photophysics SX-17 MV stopped-flow spectrophotometer (36Witting P.K. Mauk A.G. Lay P.A. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 11495-11503Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Typically, 250 time-dependent spectra (logarithmic time-base, integration 2.56 ms, dead-time ∼2 ms, and λ = 350–750 nm, resolution 1 nm) were collected over 500 s at 25 °C. Kinetic data were processed using Pro-Kineticist global analysis software (Pro-Kineticist, Version 4.1; Applied Photophysics, Leatherhead, UK) (37Pattison D.I. Davies M.J. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2001; 14: 1453-1464Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar). Apparent rate constants (k) were then determined by linear regression. For these experiments probucol and DTBP were dissolved in 70% aqueous ethanol to enhance mixing with HOCl, as no meaningful kinetic data were obtained using the hexane/aqueous HOCl conditions described above. Electronic Spectroscopy—Electronic spectra were measured with a Hitachi UV-visible spectrophotometer. Spectra of authentic compounds and analytically pure oxidation products were obtained in ethanol (purity 99.7%), and maxima were determined by manual peak picking. Statistical Analyses—Statistical analyses were performed using the Prism statistical program (GraphPad, San Diego, CA). Concentration-response curves were compared by two-way analysis of variance. Student's t tests were performed to determine significant changes between paired data sets with Welch's correction employed for unequal variances where appropriate. In all cases, statistical significance was accepted at the 95% confidence interval (p < 0.05). It was reported recently that pretreatment of aortic rings with non-cytotoxic concentrations of reagent HOCl (0–500 μm) resulted in a dose-dependent loss of endothelium-dependent relaxation (16Stocker R. Huang A. Jeranian E. Hou J.Y. Wu T. Thomas S.R. Keaney Jr., J.F. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2004; 24: 2028-2033Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, treating aortic rings from control rabbits with 400 μm HOCl essentially abolished subsequent relaxation in response to acetylcholine (Fig. 1A). In contrast, rings from probucol-supplemented animals treated with HOCl retained responsiveness to acetylcholine, as judged by their relaxation (Fig. 1A) and greater content of cGMP (Fig. 1B), although the extent of relaxation did not reach that of the native vessel without oxidant treatment (Fig. 1A). Aortas from probucol-fed rabbits contained probucol at ∼100 pmol/mg protein (Fig. 1C), demonstrating the presence of the drug in this tissue. Similar to the situation with in vivo supplemented probucol, preincubation of aortic rings from control animals with increasing amounts of added probucol for 10 min followed by thorough washing also protected the vessels from HOCl-induced loss of response to acetylcholine in a concentration-dependent manner, with full protection seen with 100 μm drug (Fig. 2). Rings pretreated with 100 μm probucol responded to acetylcholine by increased tissue content of cGMP (Fig. 2B), and contained ∼400 pmol drug/mg protein (Fig. 2C).Fig. 2In vitro added probucol and DTBP attenuate HOCl-induced endothelial dysfunction.A, aortic rings from rabbits fed normal diet were preincubated for 10 min without (□) or with 10 (♦,⋄), 25 (▴, ▵), or 100 μm (•, ○) probucol (filled symbols) or DTBP (open symbols), washed, and then exposed to 400 μm HOCl prior to preconstriction and relaxation in response to acetylcholine. *, p < 0.05 for comparison of untreated rings versus rings treated with probucol or DTBP.

Darley-Usmar V.M. Wood J. Joseph J. Parthasarathy S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6789-6795Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas little is known about its ability to scavenge two-electron (2e) oxidants such as HOCl. Therefore, we examined the oxidation of probucol by HOCl. The reaction with HOCl resulted in the dose-dependent consumption of probucol as judged by HPLC (Fig. 3A). This consumption occurred within minutes (data not shown) and resulted in the appearance of several oxidation products (Fig. 3B, compounds labeled 1–7). Others (39Barnhart R.L. Busch S.J. Jackson R.L. J. Lipid Res. 1989; 30: 1703-1710Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reported oxidation of probucol to DPQ that co-eluted with 7 and appeared as a negative peak at 270 nm (Fig. 3B, solid line) and as a positive peak at 420 nm (Fig. 3B, dashed line) (33Witting P.K. Pettersson K. Östlund-Lindqvist A.-M. Westerlund C. Wågberg M. Stocker R. J. Clin. Investig. 1999; 104: 213-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Based on this, we assigned 7 as DPQ. Similarly, structural assignment for 3 was verified by spiking with authentic DTBP (not shown), mass (Table I), and 1H NMR analyses of an analytically pure sample that showed singlet absorptions at 5.27, 7.33, and 1.40 ppm in the ratio 1:2:18, assigned as phenolic, aromatic, and methyl H-atoms, respectively. The identities of the remaining oxidation products were assigned by isolating sufficient analytically pure material for use in negative ion electrospray ionization-MS (see supplemental material Fig. I for representative mass spectra). Table I summarizes the mass determinations of the isolated products 1–6. DTBP, DPQ, and all other oxidation products were detected in samples of probucol oxidized with HOCl, independent of the molar ratio of oxidant to target (Fig. 3B). Structures were assigned to the various products based on experimentally determined molecular weights (Table I) and known chemistry of sulfur-containing molecules (40March J. Advanced Organic Chemistry. Reactions, Mechanisms, and Structure. McGraw-Hill, New York1977: 110-113Google Scholar). Oxidation product 1, assigned as a chlorophenol, showed the expected isotopic distribution for chlorine in the corresponding parent ion detected by mass spectrometry (supplemental material Fig. I). Using these assignments, the concentration of DTBP and combined products (defined as DPQ plus 2, 4, and 6) were quantified retrospectively using corresponding authentic standards prepared from the isolated products. With HOCl at ≤2 mol of oxidant/probucol, consumption of probucol was matched by a near stoichiometric accumulation of DTBP (Fig. 3A, filled circles) plus the combined products (open triangles). Thereafter, the combined products increased slightly, whereas DTBP decreased and was almost depleted with 5 mol of HOCl/mol of probucol.Table INegative ion mass analyses of isolated oxidation products from in vitro reactions of probucol and HOClView Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Open table in a new tab As oxidation of probucol with HOCl consistently generated DTBP as a major intermediate over the oxidant concentrations tested (not shown), we next examined HOCl-induced oxidation of DTBP. HOCl dose dependently oxidized DTBP resulting in a near stoichiometric accumulation of the combined products (Fig. 3C) with a pattern (Fig. 3D) similar to that for probucol. Notably, the aqueous phase of reaction mixtures containing probucol or DTBP oxidized with 5 mol eq HOCl also contained SO42− at final concentrations of 139 ± 14 or 204 ± 43 nmol, respectively. By comparison, the concentration of SO42− in the antioxidant-free mixtures containing hexane, water, and HOCl was significantly lower (58 ± 5 nmol) indicating that HOCl-mediated oxidation of probucol and DTBP produced SO42−. To determine whether the probucol oxidation profile identified was specific to reactions with HOCl, additional 2e and 1e oxidants were tested (Table II). As can be seen, in addition to HOCl, substantial oxidation (>90% consumption over 60 min) was observed with lead dioxide, also a 2e oxidant. By comparison, other 2e oxidants, peroxynitrite (ONOO–) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and the 1e oxidants, Cu2+, Fe2+/H2O2, and the peroxyl radical generator AAPH caused little consumption, and ceric ammonium nitrate caused intermediate probucol consumption.

We have previously shown that the expression of Cd-rap, like many other cartilage matrix proteins, is repressed by interleukin 1β and that the transcription factor CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) β plays an important role in the interleukin 1β-induced repression (Okazaki, K., Li, J., Yu, H., Fukui, N., and Sandell, L. J. (2002) J. Biol. Chem. 277, 31526–31533). The co-activators CREB-binding protein (CBP) and p300 are transcriptional co-regulators that participate in the activities of many different transcription factors including C/EBP. Here we show that CBP/p300 can reverse the inhibitory effect of C/EBP and moreover can stimulate expression of Cd-rap. The mechanism of this effect is shown to involve a unique synergy whereby CBP/p300 stimulate Cd-rap gene expression by at least two mechanisms. First, binding of CBP/p300 to C/EBPβ leads to sequestration of C/EBP eliminating DNA binding and subsequent repression; second, binding of CBP/p300 to the transcriptional activator Sox9 increases Sox9 DNA binding to the Cd-rap promoter leading to further stimulation of gene transcription. This is an example of a complementary transcriptional network whereby two very different mechanisms act together to confer a functional increase in transcription. This new paradigm is likely generally applicable to cartilage genes as Col2a1 cartilage collagen gene responds similarly.

Kempf H. Murtaugh L.C. Sato M.E. Lassar A.B. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1990-2005Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). It was originally cloned as an mRNA co-regulated with Col2a1 in chondrocytes and provides a reliable model for chondrocyte gene transcription (2Dietz U.H. Sandell L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3311-3316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Melanoma inhibitory activity (MIA), the human homologue of Cd-rap, was isolated independently from a cell line derived from a brain metastasis of a human melanoma (3Blesch A. Bosserhoff A.K. Apfel R. Behl C. Hessdoerfer B. Schmitt A. Jachimczak P. Lottspeich F. Buettner R. Bogdahn U. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 5695-5701PubMed Google Scholar). Cd-rap/MIA is expressed by various tumor cells including melanoma, chondrosarcoma, and breast cancer, but its physiological expression is restricted primarily to cartilage (4Bosserhoff A.K. Moser M. Hein R. Landthaler M. Buettner R. J. Pathol. 1999; 187: 446-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The protein structure of Cd-rap/MIA showed that it is a Src homologue 3 domain, a feature that is unique for an extracellular protein. We have shown previously that the expression of Cd-rap is repressed by interleukin 1β (IL-1β) (5Kondo S. Cha S.H. Xie W.F. Sandell L.J. J. Orthop. Res. 2001; 19: 712-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), a major cytokine that mediates the inflammatory reaction, and is considered to play an important role in the cartilage degradation observed in osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. The transcription factor C/EBPβ plays an important role in the IL-1β-induced repression of both Cd-rap and Col2a1 (6Okazaki K. Li J. Yu H. Fukui N. Sandell L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31526-31533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). C/EBPs are a family of transcription factors that contain a highly conserved, basic leucine zipper domain at the carboxyl terminus that is involved in dimerization and DNA binding. C/EBPβ mRNA can produce at least three isoforms by alternative initiation of translation, 38 kDa (liver-enriched activated protein (LAP-FL)), 35 kDa (LAP), and 20 kDa (liver-enriched inhibitory protein (LIP)), with the LAP and the LIP forms being the major polypeptides produced in cells (7Descombes P. Schibler U. Cell. 1991; 67: 569-579Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar). These two proteins share the 145 carboxyl-terminal amino acids that contain the basic DNA-binding domain and the leucine zipper dimerization helix (7Descombes P. Schibler U. Cell. 1991; 67: 569-579Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar) but differ at the amino terminus. IL-1β treatment of lung interstitial cells or rat chondrosarcoma (RCS) cells increase C/EBPβ mRNA and protein levels, including LAP and LIP (6Okazaki K. Li J. Yu H. Fukui N. Sandell L.J. J. Biol.

Physiol. 2003; 285: C1349-C1355Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), and all forms of C/EBPβ and a related protein C/EBPδ repress Cd-rap gene expression. Col2a1 is also repressed by C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ (6Okazaki K. Li J. Yu H. Fukui N. Sandell L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31526-31533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Sox9, a high mobility group domain transcription factor, has been identified as a key regulator in chondrocyte differentiation (9Lefebvre V. Huang W. Harley V.R. Goodfellow P.N. de Crombrugghe B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2336-2346Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Sox9 is a member of a large family of proteins that harbor a DNA-binding domain with >50% similarly to that of sex-determining region Y, the testis-determining gene in mammals (10Foster J.W. Dominguez-Steglich M.A. Guioli S. Kowk G. Weller P.A. Stevanovic M. Weissenbach J. Mansour S. Young I.D. Goodfellow P.N. Nature. 1994; 372: 525-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (1333) Google Scholar). Sox9 binds to and controls transcription factor of the Col2a1 (11Bell D.M. Leung K.K. Wheatley S.C. Ng L.J. Zhou S. Ling K.W. Sham M.H. Koopman P. Tam P.P. Cheah K.S. Nat. Genet. 1997; 16: 174-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (777) Google Scholar) and Cd-rap (12Xie W.F. Zhang X. Sakano S. Lefebvre V. Sandell L.J. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1999; 14: 757-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) genes. Co-activators CBP and p300 were originally identified as proteins that bind to the adenoviral E1A and the cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB), respectively (10Foster J.W. Dominguez-Steglich M.A. Guioli S. Kowk G. Weller P.A. Stevanovic M. Weissenbach J. Mansour S. Young I.D. Goodfellow P.N. Nature. 1994; 372: 525-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (1333) Google Scholar, 13Eckner R. Ewen M.E. Newsome D. Gerdes M. DeCaprio J.A. Lawrence J.B. Livingston D.M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 869-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (927) Google Scholar). The CBP/p300 genes are conserved in a variety of multicellular organisms, from worms to humans, and are very similar in structure and function. The CBP/p300 proteins are very large transcriptional co-regulators that participate in the activities of many different transcription factors such as CREB, c-JUN, and p53 including C/EBP. The simultaneous interaction of multiple transcription factors with CBP/p300 has been proposed to contribute to transcriptional synergy (14Vo N. Goodman R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13505-13508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar). p300 also enhances both basal Col1a2 promoter activity and transforming growth factor-β- or Smad3-induced activity (15Ghosh A.K. Yuan W. Mori Y. Varga J. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 3546-3555Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). CBP/p300 control the transcription activity of cartilage homeoprotein-1 (cart1) through acetylation of a lysine residue that is highly conserved in other homeoproteins (16Iioka T. Furukawa K. Yamaguchi A. Shindo H. Yamashita S. Tsukazaki T. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2003; 18: 1419-1429Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). CBP/p300 play pivotal roles in embryonic development and are implicated in tumorigenesis. The role of CBP/p300 in skeletal development and cancer was first suggested by the observations that the human CBP gene was disrupted in a dominant genetic disorder, Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome. Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome is characterized by craniofacial and limb defects and mental retardation as well as developmental anomalies of the eyes, heart, kidney, lung, skin, and testes (17Rubinstein J.H. Am. J. Med. Genet. Suppl. 1990; 6: 3-16PubMed Google Scholar). Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome results not only from gross chromosomal rearrangements of chromosome 16p but also from point mutations in the CBP gene itself (18Petrij F. Giles R.H. Dauwerse H.G. Saris J.J. Hennekam R.C. Masuno M. Tommerup N. van Ommen G.J. Goodman R.H. Peters D.J. Breuning M.H. Nature. 1995; 376: 348-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (1029) Google Scholar). Because of this syndrome, we hypothesized that CBP/p300 could affect chondrocyte gene expression. To test this hypothesis, we investigated the effects of CBP/p300 on Cd-rap gene expression and the potential functional interaction of CBP/p300 with C/EBPβ. While this investigation was in progress, the interaction of the positive transcriptional regulator Sox9 with CBP/p300 was reported to affect Col2a1 gene expression (19Tsuda M. Takahashi S. Takahashi Y. Asahara H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27224-27229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Consequently we broadened our studies to include Sox9. We found that CBP/p300 interact independently with Sox9 and C/EBP, functioning by different but complementary mechanisms to increase expression of cartilage genes. First we demonstrate a unique mechanism by which CBP/p300 bind to C/EBP and inhibit its DNA binding. Second CBP/p300 act to increase Sox9 binding to the Cd-rap promoter. Thus, removal of C/EBP repression by CBP/p300 occurs in consort with enhancement of Sox9-DNA binding to functionally increase transcription. Cell Line—The RCS cell line was grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. This cell line was derived from a rat chondrosarcoma and provided by Dr. James H. Kimura. It is maintained in a 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C. All experiments were repeated a minimum of three times. Northern Blot—Total RNA was isolated from culture cells using the RNeasy™ minikit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Ten micrograms of total RNA/lane were separated on a 1.3% agarose gel and transferred to Hybond™-N nylon membrane (Amersham Biosciences). The membranes were prehybridized for 4 h and then hybridized as described before (6Okazaki K. Li J. Yu H. Fukui N. Sandell L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31526-31533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Probes for CBP and p300 were generated by PCR as described previously (21Mochizuki K. Suruga K. Sakaguchi N. Takase S. Goda T. Gene (Amst.). 2002; 291: 271-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Antibodies—Antibodies to C/EBPβ (C-19), C/EBPδ (C-22), Sox9 (P-20), and Ikaros (E-20) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Antibody to p300 (RW105) was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). Plasmid Preparation—The mouse Cd-rap promoter 5′-deletion constructs were made by PCR and subcloned into pGL3-basic vector as described previously (6Okazaki K. Li J. Yu H. Fukui N. Sandell L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31526-31533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis within the Cd-rap promoter was performed by PCR (6Okazaki K. Li J. Yu H. Fukui N. Sandell L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31526-31533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The following primers used in PCR were from Cd-rap promoter sequences: 5′-CAC TTT GAT GTA TTC TAA ATT GGG CCA TTC AAA ACA TGA GAA CAA CAT GC-3′ (sense for C/EBP MT in 2.2-kbp SOX MT Cd-rap) and 5′-GCA TGT TGT TCT CAT GTT TTG AAT GGC CCA ATT TAG AAT ACA TCA AAG TG-3′ (antisense for C/EBP MT in 2.2-kbp SOX MT Cd-rap). CMV-C/EBPβ-FL, CMV-LAP, CMV-LIP, and CMV-C/EBPδ were prepared as described previously (6Okazaki K. Li J. Yu H. Fukui N. Sandell L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31526-31533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). CMV-Sox9 in pcDNA3 with amino-terminal FLAG epitope was a gift from Dr. Michael Wegner (22Sock E. Pagon R.A. Keymolen K. Lissens W. Wegner M. Scherer G. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2003; 12: 1439-1447Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). CMV-p300 and CMV-CBP in pcDNA3 and serial deletions of GST-CBP were from Dr. Ralf Janknecht (23Janknecht R. Nordheim A. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1961-1969PubMed Google Scholar). Transient Transfection Assay—RCS cells were transfected with FuGENE 6™ transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly 3 × 105 cells/well were cultured on a 6-well plate for 6 h. The transfection mixture contained 1–2.6 μlof FuGENE 6, 0.2–0.5 μg of promoter construct, 5–40 ng of Sox9, 30–400 ng of p300, 0.5–2.0 μg of C/EBPβ-FL, or 80 ng of pCMV-β-gal in a total volume of 100 μl. Due to low translation efficiency of C/EBPβ-FL, we used higher amounts of plasmid for transfection as shown previously (6Okazaki K. Li J. Yu H. Fukui N. Sandell L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31526-31533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The relative rate of plasmid to promoter constructs was 1:4. The total amount of DNA per well was adjusted to 0.6 or 2.58 μg by the addition of vector alone. On the following day, medium was replaced, and cells were cultured for 36 h. CMV-C/EBPβ-FL, CMV-Sox9, CMV-CBP, and CMV-p300 were co-transfected with CMV-β-galactosidase as an internal control. The luciferase activities were assayed and normalized to β-galactosidase. Medium contained 10% fetal calf serum. Pull-down Assay—Pull-down assays were performed using in vitro translated transcription factors and truncated GST fusion CBP. LAP, LIP, or Sox9 was translated in vitro with the TnT® translation system (Promega, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's instructions. To prepare radioactively labeled protein, each translation reaction contained 8 μCi of [35S]methionine (10 mCi/ml) (Amersham Biosciences) and a mixture of amino acids lacking methionine. A 1% volume of the supernatant was loaded on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel as the input fraction. GST fusion proteins were induced by isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. GST fusion proteins were mixed with 15 μl of glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) in 50% buffer slurry along with the remaining 35S-labeled in vitro translated protein. For C/EBPβ, the mixture was incubated for 2 h at 4 °C and washed three times with buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. For Sox9, the mixture was incubated with buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. Co-immunoprecipitation Assay—RCS cells grown in 100-mm tissue culture dishes were treated for 48 h with 10 ng/ml IL-1β (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). After a 48-h incubation with IL-1β, cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in Binding Buffer X containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 120 mm NaCl, 0.5% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. After incubating for 30 min on ice, the lysates were centrifuged at 21,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Supernatants from 24 10-cm dishes were pooled, and an aliquot, containing 1 mg of protein in 500 μl, was incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with 20 μl of protein A-agarose to remove nonspecific protein binding. After centrifugation at 800 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, supernatants were transferred to a new tube. Ten micrograms of preimmune rabbit IgG, anti-C/EBPβ, or anti-p300 antibody were added to each tube and incubated overnight at 4 °C. On the following day, 20 μl of protein A-agarose were added to each tube and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed three times with Binding Buffer X after centrifugation at 800 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitated samples and starting material were separated by SDS-PAGE (5–15% gradient gels) and blotted onto a Hybond-C Extra mixed ester nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Biosciences). The membranes were immunoblotted with anti-C/EBPβ antibody or anti-p300 antibody and developed using an enhanced chemiluminescence substrate kit (Pierce). Two percent of input protein was resolved by SDS-PAGE. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—Oligonucleotides were synthesized by Invitrogen, and complementary oligonucleotides were end-labeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP. Oligonucleotide P3 spanning –2095 to –2063 bp of the Cd-rap promoter covered the C/EBPβ site (6Okazaki K. Li J. Yu H. Fukui N. Sandell L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31526-31533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). LAP, LIP, CBP, and p300 proteins were synthesized by in vitro translation. After purification of GST fusion proteins using glutathione-Sepharose 4B and GST elution buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 20 mm reduced glutathione), the size and concentration of each fusion protein was verified by Coomassie Blue staining of the 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and the Bradford protein assay. The concentration of each was equalized with GST elution buffer. Reaction mixtures contained 2 μlof5× EMSA buffer (25% glycerol, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 250 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol), 2 μg of poly(dI-dC) with the 32P-labeled DNA probe, in vitro translated protein, antibodies as indicated, and water in a total volume of 10 μl. Binding reactions were incubated for 15 min at room temperature. Products were analyzed on 4% polyacrylamide gels in 0.5× Tris borate-EDTA buffer. The gels were dried and autoradiographed. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChiP) Assay—The ChiP assay was performed with a ChiP Assay kit (Upstate Biotechnology) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly 1.8 × 106 RCS cells were cultured on a 10-cm dish for 6 h. Then the RCS cells were treated with IL-1β (10 ng/ml). Two hours after the incubation with IL-1β, a transient transfection assay was performed. The transfection mixture contained 20 μl of FuGENE 6 and 0.1 μg of CMV-p300 in a total volume of 0.2 μl. Cells were cultured for 40 h. The RCS cells were incubated with IL-1β for 48 h. Medium contained 10% fetal calf serum. The following primers used in PCR were from Cd-rap promoter sequences: 5′-TGC CCA AAG AAA CAC TTT GA-3′ (sense for C/EBP), 5′-AAT GCC CAG AAC CAC AAA AA-3′ (antisense for C/EBP), 5′-TTG CTC AGT ACC TGG GAA CC-3′ (sense for SOX), and 5′-AGG CAG GCT GGA CTA TCT GA-3′ (antisense for SOX). Input DNA control was diluted 1:10 for PCR. The PCR products were amplified for 32 cycles (C/EBP) and 25 cycles (SOX), respectively. CBP/p300 Enhance the Cd-rap Promoter Activity and Overcome Repression by C/EBPβ—We have previously shown that the expression of the Cd-rap is down-regulated by IL-1β in bovine articular chondrocytes (5Kondo S. Cha S.H. Xie W.F. Sandell L.J. J. Orthop. Res. 2001; 19: 712-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and RCS cells (6Okazaki K. Li J. Yu H. Fukui N. Sandell L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31526-31533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). As a model for native chondrocytes, RCS cells were used to define the mechanism of IL-1β down-regulation of the Cd-rap mediated by the transcription factor C/EBP; the effect was then confirmed in human primary chondrocytes. RCS cells synthesize extracellular matrix in a manner very similar to that of chondrocytes. To test the effect of CBP/p300 on the Cd-rap promoter activity, a CBP/p300 expression plasmid was co-transfected into RCS cells with the 2.2-kbp Cd-rap promoter. As shown previously (6Okazaki K. Li J. Yu H. Fukui N. Sandell L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31526-31533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), co-transfection of CMV-C/EBPβ-FL decreased the Cd-rap promoter activity in a dose-dependent manner compared with the empty vector pcDNA3 (Fig. 1A). The other isoforms of C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ also decreased the promoter activity (6Okazaki K. Li J. Yu H. Fukui N. Sandell L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31526-31533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In contrast, co-transfection with either CMV-CBP or CMV-p300 strongly enhanced the Cd-rap promoter activity in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1A). To determine whether CBP/p300 could reverse the negative effect of C/EBPβ, transfection assays were performed with C/EBPβ-FL and p300 alone or together. As illustrated in Fig. 1B, co-transfection with p300 and C/EBPβ-FL together restored the Cd-rap promoter activity that was repressed by C/EBPβ-FL alone. CBP/p300 have also been shown to stimulate expression of chondrocyte-specific Col2a1 enhancer (19Tsuda M. Takahashi S. Takahashi Y. Asahara H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27224-27229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Therefore, we hypothesize that CBP/p300 may enhance cartilage gene expression by a common mechanism. C/EBPβ, but Not CBP/p300, Responds to IL-1β in RCS Cells—The previous experiment suggests that the ratio of C/EBP to CBP/p300 would have an effect on function (Fig. 1). We have shown that C/EBPβ protein and mRNA expression are increased upon stimulation with IL-1β (6Okazaki K. Li J. Yu H. Fukui N. Sandell L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31526-31533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and that C/EBP proteins down-regulate Cd-rap gene expression. Therefore, we asked whether this ratio would change in the presence of IL-1β. To determine whether CBP/p300 respond to IL-1β, Western blot analysis was performed with RCS whole cell lysates. For C/EBPβ, after treating with IL-1β (10 ng/ml) for 48 h, the total amount of expression was increased, and one of the isoforms of C/EBPβ, LIP, was observed only after IL-1β treatment (Fig. 2A). For p300, the total amount of expression was not affected by IL-1β treatment. Quantification by densitometry showed 1.69 relative density for non-treatment and 1.74 relative density for IL-1β treatment (Fig. 2A). To investigate the expression of C/EBPβ, Sox9, and CBP/p300 genes, a Northern blot was performed. As shown in Fig. 2B, the mRNA level of C/EBPβ increased with time after treating with IL-1β; however, neither p300 nor CBP mRNAs changed over the 48-h time period (Fig. 2B). The mRNA level of Sox9 did not significantly change over the 48-h period assessed (Fig. 2B). Thus mRNA and protein results are consistent with a differential effect of IL-1β on C/EBPβ and CBP/p300 that potentially results in an increased ratio of C/EBP to p300 that would act to repress Cd-rap transcription. C/EBPβ Interacts with a Specific Domain of CBP/p300 in RCS Cells—C/EBPβ has been shown to interact with p300 in the quail fibroblast cell line QT6 using overexpression of proteins (24Mink S. Haenig B. Klempnauer K.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6609-6617Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Schwartz C. Beck K. Mink S. Schmolke M. Budde B. Wenning D. Klempnauer K.H. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 882-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). To assess the endogenous intracellular association of C/EBPβ with p300 in chondrocytes, co-immunoprecipitation assays were performed in RCS cell lysates. RCS cells were treated with IL-1β (10 ng/ml) for 48 h to induce endogenous C/EBPβ. The cell lysate was incubated with antisera to C/EBPβ and p300 and preimmune IgG. Immunoblot analysis of the precipitated fraction with anti-C/EBPβ or anti-p300 showed that p300 co-precipitated with LAP in these cells (Fig. 3). C/EBPβ-FL and LAP cannot be distinguished on this Western blot. The isoform of C/EBPβ, LIP, was also observed to interact with p300 (Fig. 3, left panel). In Fig. 3, the immunocomplex with p300 contained more LIP than LAP. Two possibilities could account for this observation. First, p300 might have bound degraded C/EBP that reacts with anti-C/EBPβ antibody. Second, in IL-1β-treated RCS cells, LAP appears to be more abundant than LIP; however, LIP appears to bind more p300. Potentially these experiments indicate that LIP has a higher affinity for CBP/p300 (Fig. 3). To further confirm this association between C/EBP isoforms and CBP/p300 and map the site of interaction, we performed a pull-down assay using the constructs consisting of small domains of CBP-GST fusion proteins (Fig. 4A). GST-CBP fusion proteins were synthesized and visualized by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 4B). The interaction between fragments of CBP and C/EBPβ isoforms is shown in Fig. 4C. In vitro translated and radiolabeled LAP and LIP were used in these experiments. Autoradiography demonstrated that only the CH3 domain of CBP interacted with LAP and LIP but not GST alone. As a control, we confirmed that this domain of CBP also interacted with Sox9, recently reported by Tsuda et al. (19Tsuda M. Takahashi S. Takahashi Y. Asahara H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27224-27229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4C). These data indicate that GST-CBP Δ5 that contains the CH3 domain of CBP was the only GST-CBP fusion protein that bound to C/EBPβ. CBP/p300 Interfere with the DNA Binding Activity of C/EBPβ—To examine the effect of CBP/p300 on the DNA binding of C/EBPβ isoforms, EMSAs were performed. The oligonucleotide P3 is from –2095 to –2063 bp of the Cd-rap promoter and contains the C/EBP motif. A longer probe spanning –2121 to –2069 bp was also used with identical results (data not shown). Translated proteins used in these binding analyses were C/EBPδ and the truncated forms of C/EBPβ, LAP (missing 21 amino acids) and LIP (missing 151 amino acids). We have previously shown that C/EBPβ binds to this wild type probe but not to the mutant probe (6Okazaki K. Li J. Yu H. Fukui N. Sandell L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31526-31533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). C/EBPδ as well as C/EBPβ is known to be activated by IL-1β and tumor necrosis factor-α at the mRNA level (26Greenwel P. Tanaka S. Penkov D. Zhang W. Olive M. Moll J. Vinson C. Di Liberto M. Ramirez F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 912-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) and the protein level (27Jain R. Police S. Phelps K. Pekala P.H. Biochem. J. 1999; 338: 737-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). We have shown previously that LAP, LIP, and C/EBPδ were induced after IL-1β treatment in RCS cells (6Okazaki K. Li J. Yu H. Fukui N. Sandell L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31526-31533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). To confirm this binding was due to the C/EBP motif, we used the P3 Mut probe that contains mutations in the C/EBP motif. In EMSA with the P3 Mut probe, in vitro translated LIP, LAP, or C/EBPδ protein did not bind to this probe (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 1B, co-transfection with p300 and C/EBPβ-FL together restored the Cd-rap promoter activity that was repressed by C/EBPβ-FL alone, and we further showed direct interaction between C/EBP and CBP/p300 (Fig. 4C). Therefore, we hypothesized that CBP/p300 could alter the DNA binding of C/EBPβ. To test this hypothesis, we performed EMSAs to determine the effect of CBP/p300 on DNA binding activity of C/EBPβ. Oligonucleotide P3 was used as probe. First we tested whether in vitro translated CBP/p300 could bind to the probe DNA. CBP/p300 could not bind to the P3 probe under the conditions in which LIP and LAP bound well (Fig. 5A). Next we determined the effect of CBP/p300 on DNA binding activity of in vitro translated C/EBPβ. Constant amounts of in vitro translated C/EBPs (LIP, LAP, and C/EBPδ) were added to"
https://openalex.org/W2034253009,"The opportunistic human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa is one of a few microorganisms that code for three different classes (I, II, and III) of the enzyme ribonucleotide reductase (RNR). Class II RNR of P. aeruginosa differs from all hitherto known class II enzymes by being encoded by two consecutive open reading frames denoted nrdJa and nrdJb and separated by 16 bp. Split nrdJ genes were also found in the few other γ-proteobacteria that code for a class II RNR. Interestingly, the two genes encoding the split nrdJ in P. aeruginosa were co-transcribed, and both proteins were expressed. Exponentially growing aerobic cultures were predominantly expressing the class I RNR (encoded by the nrdAB operon) compared with the class II RNR (encoded by the nrdJab operon). Upon entry to stationary phase, the relative amount of nrdJa transcript increased about 6–7-fold concomitant with a 6-fold decrease in the relative amount of nrdA transcript. Hydroxyurea treatment known to knock out the activity of class I RNR caused strict growth inhibition of P. aeruginosa unless 5′-deoxyadenosylcobalamin, a cofactor specifically required for activity of class II RNRs, was added to the rich medium. Rescue of the hydroxyurea-treated cells in the presence of the vitamin B12 cofactor strongly implies that P. aeruginosa produces a functionally active NrdJ protein. Biochemical studies showed for the first time that presence of both NrdJa and NrdJb subunits were absolutely essential for enzyme activity. Based on combined genetic and biochemical results, we suggest that the two-component class II RNR in P. aeruginosa is primarily used for DNA repair and/or possibly DNA replication at low oxygen tension.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a ubiquitous Gram-negative γ-proteobacterium capable of causing disease in plants, animals, and humans. It is an opportunistic pathogen and the leading source of nosocomial infections, causing disease in a wide range of immunocompromised patients. It is also the common cause of chronic lung infections in individuals suffering from cystic fibrosis (1Lyczak J.B. Cannon C.L. Pier G.B. Microbes Infect. 2000; 2: 1051-1060Crossref PubMed Scopus (995) Google Scholar). P. aeruginosa is not only noted for its pathogenicity but for its environmental versatility, because it is able to grow with very simple nutrient requirements and uses a huge number of different metabolic pathways (2de Lorenzo V. Environ. Microbiol. 2000; 2: 349-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Although the bacterium is respiratory and never fermentative, it will grow in the absence of oxygen if nitrate is available as a respiratory electron acceptor (3Zumft W.G. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1997; 61: 533-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (2897) Google Scholar). Interestingly, P. aeruginosa is one of a few organisms to encode in its genome three different classes (Ia, II, and III) of the enzyme ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) 1The abbreviations used are: RNR, ribonucleotide reductase; AdoCbl, 5′-deoxyadenosylcobalamin; DTT, dithiothreitol; HU, hydroxyurea; ORF, open reading frame; RT, reverse transcription. (4Jordan A. Torrents E. Sala I. Hellman U. Gibert I. Reichard P. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 3974-3980Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This essential enzyme catalyzes the reduction of ribonucleotides to the corresponding 2′-deoxyribonucleotides via a radical-dependent mechanism, thereby providing cells with the necessary building blocks for DNA synthesis (5Sjöberg B-M. Struct. Bonding. 1997; 88: 139-173Crossref Google Scholar). All known RNRs can be divided into three classes (I, II, and III) based on structural differences, metallocofactor requirements, and mechanisms used for radical generation (5Sjöberg B-M. Struct. Bonding. 1997; 88: 139-173Crossref Google Scholar, 6Jordan A. Reichard P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 71-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar, 7Eklund H. Uhlin U. Färnegårdh M. Logan D.T. Nordlund P. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 2001; 77: 177-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Class I RNRs, encoded by the nrdA and nrdB genes, are found in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms. This class has a tetrameric (α2β2) structure consisting of two homodimeric proteins: R1 (α2), with the active site and allosteric sites, and R2 (β2), with a stable tyrosyl radical essential for catalysis and linked to a diiron-oxo center required for radical generation. The activity of class I RNR is restricted to aerobic conditions. Class II RNRs, encoded by the nrdJ gene, consist of a single polypeptide chain and are either monomeric (α) or homodimeric (α2). Class II RNRs use adenosylcobalamin (AdoCbl) in the radical generation process and operate both under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. This class has been found in archaea, eubacteria, and some lower eukaryotes (8Torrents E. Aloy P. Gibert I. Rodriguez-Trelles F. J. Mol. Evol. 2002; 55: 138-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Class III RNRs, encoded by the nrdD gene, are homodimeric (α2) and carry a stable but oxygen-sensitive glycyl radical (9Sun X.Y. Ollagnier S. Schmidt P.P. Atta M. Mulliez E. Lepape L. Eliasson R. Gräslund A. Fontecave M. Reichard P. Sjöberg B-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6827-6831Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). They require a specific activase, encoded by the nrdG (β2) gene, that uses S-adenosylmethionine to generate the glycyl radical (10Eliasson R. Fontecave M. Jörnvall H. Krook M. Pontis E. Reichard P.

This class can only operate under anaerobic conditions and has been found in archaea and eubacteria (8Torrents E. Aloy P. Gibert I. Rodriguez-Trelles F. J. Mol. Evol. 2002; 55: 138-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Although there are significant differences between the three RNR classes, sequence alignments and in particular comparisons of their three-dimensional structures highlights striking similarities, including conservation of functional cysteines required for catalysis (12Booker S. Licht S. Broderick J. Stubbe J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12676-12685Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 13Jordan A. Torrents E. Jeanthon C. Eliasson R. Hellman U. Wernstedt C. Barbé J.

Holmgren A. Cohen G. Aharonowitz Y. Microbiology. 2002; 148: 391-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). All three RNR classes also share a sophisticated allosteric regulation mediated by different deoxy-and ribonucleotides, which guarantees an adequate and balanced supply of DNA precursors during DNA replication and repair. The essentiality of this enzyme makes it a good candidate for anticancer, antiviral, and antibacterial drug therapy (15Nocentini G. Crit. Rev. Oncol. Hematol. 1996; 22: 89-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 16Mayhew C.N. Phillips J.D. Cibull M.L. Elford H.L. Gallicchio V.S. Antivir. Chem.

Anticancer Ther. 2002; 2: 437-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In P. aeruginosa, the investigation of the expression and physiological function of the three different classes of RNR is important from a biomedical and physiological point of view, since such studies might contribute to a better understanding of the pathogenicity and the metabolic diversity of this species. In this study, we report that P. aeruginosa class II RNR (NrdJ) differs from all hitherto characterized RNRs in having a split nrdJ gene with two consecutive ORFs separated by 16 bp. Since class II RNR activity was earlier described in P. aeruginosa crude extracts (4Jordan A. Torrents E. Sala I. Hellman U. Gibert I. Reichard P. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 3974-3980Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), our discovery of the split nrdJ gene prompted further studies of functional aspects of class II RNR in P. aeruginosa. We show that class I and II RNRs were differentially expressed in aerobically growing P. aeruginosa and that class II is not a cryptic enzyme but requires both ORFs (NrdJa and NrdJb) for full activity and that it can support bacterial growth in the absence of class I RNR activity. Bacterial Strains, Plasmids, and Growth Conditions—All strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in Table I. Cells were cultured on Luria-Bertani (LB) medium at 37 °C. For solid media, Bacto agar (Difco) was added to a final concentration of 1.5%. When necessary, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (1 mm) was added to the media, and antibiotics were added to the following final concentrations: for Escherichia coli, 10 μg/ml tetracycline and 50 μg/ml ampicillin; for P. aeruginosa, 50 μg/ml tetracycline.Table IStrains, plasmids, and oligonucleotides used in this studyRelevant features/sequenceOrigin or referenceStrainsE. coliDH5αrecA1, endA1, hsdR, supE44, thi-1, gyrA96, relA1, Δ lacU169, deoR Φ 80dlacZM15StratageneS17-IrecA1, thi-1, pro, hsdR, <RP4: 2-Tc: Mu-: Km:Tn7, TpR, SmR, integrated into the chromosomeRef. 44Bagdasarian M.

Open table in a new tab DNA and Protein Techniques—Recombinant DNA manipulations and protein analyses were carried out according to published protocols (18Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Genomic DNA from P. aeruginosa PAO1 was isolated using the DNeasy Tissue Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's specifications. RNA Extraction and Reverse Transcription-PCR—For total RNA preparation, P. aeruginosa PAO1 cultures were mixed directly with RNAprotect bacteria reagent (Qiagen). This reagent is designed for direct stabilization of bacterial RNA in vivo, and its protection from degradation during sample collection and storage (Qiagen). After mixing, samples were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at –80 °C until RNA extraction, which took place less than a week after harvest. RNA was purified using an RNeasy kit (Qiagen) in duplicates and pooled together after the extraction. An aliquot of the culture (at A600 = 0.4) equivalent to 108 cells was used for one RNA preparation. DNA contamination was removed from the RNA preparation by treatment with RNase-free DNase (Qiagen), followed by the RNase-free DNase digestion from Ambion according to the manufacturers' instructions. The amount of the RNA was determined from its 260-nm absorption using a Smart Spec™ spectrophotometer (Bio-Rad). RNA quality was estimated from the 260/280 ratio, which was equal to 1.9–2.0 in all preparations, and from electrophoresis on a 1% agarose gel. For the RT step, 2 μg of P. aeruginosa total RNA was mixed with dNTPs (1 mm final concentration of each), and 10 μmol of specific primers in a 20-μl reaction. The reaction mixture was heated at 65 °C for 5 min followed by quick transfer to ice. After the addition of buffer, 40 units of RNase inhibitor RnaseOUT, 15 units of Thermoscript reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen), and 5 mm DTT final concentration, 20-μl reactions were incubated at 60 °C for 50 min, followed by a 5-min inactivation step at 85 °C in a Robocycler 96 (Stratagene). In control samples (–RT in Fig. 1B), reverse transcriptase was omitted from the reactions, which were run in parallel in the Robocycler. To digest the RNA at the end of the RT reaction, 2 units of E. coli RNase H were added, and reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 20 min. For the subsequent PCR amplification, 2 μl of the RT reaction (or negative control) was mixed with 0.2 mm each pair of primers, 0.2 mm of each dNTP, 5 μl of 10× PCR buffer and 1.5 units of High Expand Fidelity Taq polymerase (Roche Applied Science) in a total volume of 50 μl. For co-transcription studies of nrdAB, PCR mixtures were supplemented with Me2SO to 0.4% final concentration. PCR amplifications were carried out under the following conditions: 94 °C for 180 s, followed by 35 cycles of 60 s at 94 °C, 60 s at either 49 °C (nrdAB studies) or 56 °C (nrdJab studies), and 90 s at 72 °C and completed by 420 s at 72 °C. The RT-PCR end point products of both positive reactions (+RT) and negative controls (–RT) were run on 2% agarose gel, containing ethidium bromide, and visualized under UV light. Quantitative RT-PCR Studies—To quantify class I and class II RNR transcripts from exponential to stationary growth phase as well as after HU treatment, several different protocols from Applied Biosystems, Qiagen and Invitrogen were tested. In the final protocol 0.5 μg of total P. aeruginosa RNA was reverse transcribed in the Robocycler in a 25-μl volume with Taqman RT reagent kit (Applied Biosystems) at 48 °C using random hexamers according to the manufacturer's specifications. In the subsequent real time PCR step, 10 μl of a 10-fold diluted RT product corresponding to 20 ng of a total RNA was mixed with a 30-μl premix consisting of a ready to use qPCR Platinum® SYBR® Green qPCR SuperMix-UDG kit (Invitrogen), 0.8 μl of 50× concentrated ROX reference dye (Invitrogen), and 0.2 μm each of the selected specific primers. Negative controls (–RT) were run in parallel in each run. PCR amplifications were performed on an ABI Prism 7000 sequence detector (Applied Biosystems) in a 96-well optical reaction plate sealed with optical adhesive covers (Applied Biosystems). Before amplification, a uracil-DNA glycosylase decontamination step that prevents carryover of PCR products between wells was done at 50 °C for 120 s. The PCR amplification cycle consisted of 120 s of hot start at 95 °C, followed by 50 two-step amplification cycles of 20 s at 95 °C and 30 s at 62.5 °C. At the end of the thermocycling protocol, a melting curve analysis was done between 60 and 95 °C to confirm specific product amplification. Reactions were run in triplicates for each experimental time point and at two or more independent occasions. The results were analyzed in Microsoft Excel. Copy numbers of nrdA, nrdJa, 16 S rRNA, and proC transcripts were calculated, following the suggestions of Applied Biosystems (19Biosystems Applied User Bulletin 2: ABI PRISM 7700 Sequence Detection System. Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA1997: 1-24Google Scholar), from calibration curves obtained from serially diluted linearized copies of plasmid DNA or cDNA (usually within the range of 102 to 107) containing either nrdJa, nrdA, 16 S rRNA, or proC target sequences. To compensate for possible variations in quantity or quality of starting RNA and/or differences in reverse transcriptase efficiencies, the number of copies of nrdJa and nrdA mRNA determined in the real time PCR experiment for each time point were then normalized on the basis of 16 S rRNA or proC levels in the same sample. Overexpression of the nrdJ Region Products—The broad-host-range expression vector pVLT31 (20de Lorenzo V. Eltis L. Kessler B. Timmis K.N. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 123: 17-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar) was used to overproduce the proteins encoded in the nrdJ genomic region. To construct pETS131, the nrdJa region was amplified by PCR using primers OP1-VLT-up and OP2-J1-lw and using genomic DNA from the P. aeruginosa PAO1 strain. The 2209-bp fragment was cloned into pGEM-T easy vector (Promega), and the XbaI and HindIII double-digested fragment containing the nrdJa region was cloned into the corresponding sites of pVLT31. A similar procedure instead using primers OP1-VLT-up and OP4-J2-lw for cloning the 2913-bp entire nrdJ region was used for the construction of plasmid pETS133. Plasmids were transferred by biparental conjugation from E. coli S17-I to P. aeruginosa PAO1 on membrane filters with early log phase E. coli donors and P. aeruginosa recipients grown overnight at 43 °C. Filters were incubated at 37 °C on LB agar for 6 h before plating onto selective LB medium plates. For expression analyses, P. aeruginosa carrying pVLT31, pETS131, and pETS133 were grown until midlog phase, and cells were induced with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 5 h. Culture aliquots (5 ml) were centrifuged and dissolved in 1 ml of buffer (30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm DTT, 10 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Protein crude extracts were obtained by sonication followed by centrifugation (14,000 rpm in a microcentrifuge). Enzyme Assay—Ribonucleotide reductase class II activity was measured with CTP as a substrate by the procedure described in Refs. 4Jordan A. Torrents E. Sala I. Hellman U. Gibert I. Reichard P. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 3974-3980Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 21Thelander L. Sjöberg B-M. Eriksson S. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 51: 227-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar. Assay mixtures (50 μl) were incubated for 20 min at 25 °C and contained 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 20 mm CaCl2, 30 mm DTT, 30 μm adenosylcobalamin, 1 mm [3H]CTP (15,753 cpm/nmol) and 0.4 mm dATP. HU (50 mm) was added to the assay mixture to inhibit residual class Ia activity. One unit of enzyme activity corresponds to 1 nmol of dCTP formed per min. Specific activity is expressed as units/mg of total protein. Sequence Alignments and Phylogenetic Inference—Sequence similarity searches were performed online using BLASTP (version 2.2.10, NCBI), and global protein and DNA sequence alignments were created with the ClustalX program (version 1.8.1) (22Thompson J.D. Gibson T.J. Plewniak F. Jeanmougin F. Higgins D.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4876-4882Crossref PubMed Scopus (35497) Google Scholar). For NrdJ proteins of the proteobacterial group, we concatenated the protein sequences of the split NrdJ proteins (NrdJa + NrdJb). Neighbor joining was used to recover a protein distance matrix using ClustalX software. Default protein weight matrix (Blosum series) was used for alignments, and positions with gaps were excluded. The resultant tree was visualized with TreeView 1.6.6 (23Page R.D. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1996; 12: 357-358PubMed Google Scholar). The following GenBank™ accession numbers were used for the NrdJa and NrdJb sequences: P. aeruginosa PAO1, NP_254184.1 and NP_25483.1; P. aeruginosa UCBPP-PA14, ZP_00140329.1 and ZP_00140328.2; A. vinelandii, ZP_00090826.1 and ZP_00098027.2; M. flagellatus, ZP_00173560.1 and ZP_00173561.2; P. profundum, YP_130342.1 and YP_130343.1; Magnetococcus sp., ZP_00290088.1 and ZP_00290089.1. Genomic Organization of P. aeruginosa Class I and Class II Ribonucleotide Reductases—To study the genomic organizations of both class I and II RNR, we used the information from the complete P. aeruginosa PAO1 genome sequence (24Stover C.K. Pham X.Q. Erwin A.L. Mizoguchi S.D. Warrener P. Hickey M.J. Brinkman F.S. Hufnagle W.O. Kowalik D.J. Lagrou M. Garber R.L. Goltry L. Tolentino E. Westbrock-Wadman S. Yuan Y. Brody L.L. Coulter S.N.

Class I RNR consisted of nrdA (PA1156) and nrdB (PA1155) genes encoding proteins of 963 amino acids and 415 amino acids linked together by a 263-bp intergenic region (Fig. 1A). Surprisingly, analysis of the class II RNR DNA region revealed a split of the nrdJ gene into two ORFs, a longer 2205-bp ORF (PA5497) and a shorter 690-bp ORF (PA5496), encoding polypeptides of 734 amino acids and 229 amino acids, which we name NrdJa and NrdJb, respectively (Fig. 1A). Sequencing of several PCR products covering the entire nrdJ intergenic region confirmed the split of the nrdJ gene into two parts by the presence of a UGA stop codon (cf. Fig. 6B). To determine whether genes encoding class I or II RNR are co-transcribed, RNA from exponentially growing cells cultured in LB medium were isolated and reverse transcribed with a specific primer either to nrdB (R1-3962) or to nrdJb (R4-2430). Amplification of cDNA with primer pair F2–2853/R2–3567 for analyses of nrdA/nrdB or F4 –2044/R4 –2430 for nrdJa/nrdJb analyses (Fig. 1A) generated PCR products of the expected size (715 and 387 bp) and covered the entire intergenic regions of interest (Fig. 1B). Clearly, in both cases, nrdA/nrdB and nrdJa/nrdJb genes are co-transcribed. Sequence analyses of several RT-PCR products from the nrdJ region confirmed the presence also at the mRNA level of the stop codon and the 16-bp sequence separating the nrdJa and nrdJb genes. Class II Enzyme Activity Requires Both NrdJa and NrdJb— Next we asked whether both NrdJa and NrdJb proteins are expressed. As shown by RT-PCR, nrdJa and nrdJb genes are co-transcribed, but the upstream part of nrdJb had no apparent consensus sequence for a ribosome-binding site as judged from comparison with the 3′ sequence of the 16 S rRNA (GenBank™ accession number AB037545) from P. aeruginosa (25Shine J. Dalgarno L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1975; 57: 221-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 26Kozak M. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 234: 187-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (1129) Google Scholar). We therefore constructed two different expression derivatives by cloning either the nrdJa fragment or the entire nrdJa/nrdJb fragment into the Pseudomonas expression vector pVLT31. Expression of the protein encoded in the nrdJa fragment (pETS131 plasmid) shows a strong band around 82 kDa corresponding to the expected molecular weight of the NrdJa protein (Fig. 2, lane 3). The plasmid carrying the whole nrdJ region (pETS133) shows expression of two major proteins with molecular masses of about 82 and 25 kDa, corresponding to the NrdJa and NrdJb proteins (Fig. 2, lane 4). These results confirm that both proteins are expressed in growing cells of P. aeruginosa. In addition, no band corresponding to the molecular mass of a fused NrdJa + NrdJb polypeptide was seen in any of our expression experiments. Both NrdJa and NrdJb encode highly conserved RNR regions. NrdJa contains all the catalytic residues located at the active center of class II RNR including the three conserved cysteines (Cys-123, Cys-342, and Cys-353) needed for catalysis, and NrdJb carries the C-terminal cysteines that interact with the physiological reducing agents thioredoxin and glutaredoxin (12Booker S. Licht S. Broderick J. Stubbe J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12676-12685Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 27Arnér E.S. Holmgren A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6102-6109Crossref PubMed Scopus (2001) Google Scholar) needed for the enzyme turnover cycle. Due to the split of these two important functions of the class II RNR we a priori expected an inactive enzyme, but a class II RNR activity was previously demonstrated in a crude extract of P. aeruginosa cells (4Jordan A. Torrents E. Sala I. Hellman U. Gibert I. Reichard P. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 3974-3980Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore used the plasmid constructs to test whether both proteins were needed for a functional class II RNR or whether the NrdJa protein was enzymatically active by itself when supplied with an artificial hydrogen donor like DTT. To avoid measuring intrinsic class I RNR activity, we used dATP as allosteric effector (negative effector of class I and positive effector of class II RNR) and included the class I-specific inhibitor HU in some assays. As shown in Table II, a crude extract of P. aeruginosa carrying the pVLT31 vector without inserts has almost no activity without the class II-specific cofactor AdoCbl, and it is only after the addition of AdoCbl that we observe a class II RNR activity of about 0.068 units/mg protein, which corresponds to the previously found activity in crude extracts of P. aeruginosa (4Jordan A. Torrents E. Sala I. Hellman U. Gibert I. Reichard P. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 3974-3980Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When NrdJa is expressed from pETS131, the specific activity increases somewhat to 0.169 units/mg when AdoCbl is present in the assay. A dramatic increase is obtained when both proteins (NrdJa and NrdJb) are expressed from plasmid pETS133, in which case the class II activity is 10-fold higher than the class II background activity in crude extract. In addition, the enzyme activity in the pETS133 extract is completely AdoCbl-dependent, because no activity is present without this cofactor.Table IIClass II ribonucleotide reductase activity of P. aeruginosa carrying overproduced NrdJa and NrdJb proteinsPlasmidsCloned genesNrdJ specific activityNo additions+HU+HU/AdoCblunits/mg proteinpVLT31None0.0060.0070.068pETS131nrdJa0.0060.0060.169pETS133nrdJa/nrdJb0.0070.0080.703 Open table in a new tab Expression of Class I and II RNR as a Function of Growth Phase—Next, we investigated the differential expression of class I (nrdA) and class II (nrdJa) RNR of P. aeruginosa during different growth phases by quantitative real time PCR. As shown in Fig. 3, expression of both nrd genes clearly are dependent on the culture growth conditions but with opposite expression pattern. Class Ia RNR (nrdA) reached its highest expression at the beginning of the exponential phase and decreased dramatically at the end of the exponential phase, where it was 6–7-fold lower compared with exponential phase. On the other hand, class II RNR (nrdJa) transcription followed an inverted pattern and was increased at the end of the exponential growth phase, and in stationary phase the transcri"

Using a yeast two-hybrid screening based on the Sos recruitment system, we identified protein kinase A catalytic subunit β (PKA-Cβ) as a novel binding partner of p73. Co-immunoprecipitation and glutathione S-transferase pull-down assays revealed that p73α associated with PKA-Cβ in mammalian cells and that their interaction was mediated by both the N- and C-terminal regions of p73α. In contrast, p53 failed to bind to PKA-Cβ. In vitro phosphorylation assay demonstrated that glutathione S-transferase-p73α-(1–130), which has one putative PKA phosphorylation site, was phosphorylated by PKA. Enforced expression of PKA-Cβ resulted in significant inhibition of the transactivation function and pro-apoptotic activity of p73α, whereas a kinase-deficient mutant of PKA-Cβ had no detectable effect. Consistent with this notion, treatment with H-89 (an ATP analog that functions as a PKA inhibitor) reversed the dibutyryl cAMP-mediated inhibition of p73α. Of particular interest, PKA-Cβ facilitated the intramolecular interaction of p73α, thereby masking the N-terminal transactivation domain with the C-terminal inhibitory domain. Thus, our findings indicate a PKA-Cβ-mediated inhibitory mechanism of p73 function.

As expected, several pieces of evidence suggest that p73 can bind to the p53-responsive element and transactivate an overlapping set of p53 target genes, thus leading to induction of G1/S cell cycle arrest and apoptosis (1Kaghad M.

In marked contrast to p53, p73 is expressed as multiple isoforms arising from alternative splicing of the primary p73 transcript (p73α, p73β, p73γ, p73δ, p73ϵ, p73η, and p73ζ) termed the TA variant (1Kaghad M.

These alternatively spliced isoforms vary in their C termini and display different transcriptional and biological properties. Additionally, the ΔN variant (ΔNp73α and ΔNp73β), which is generated by alternative promoter utilization, lacks the N-terminal transactivation domain and exhibits dominant-negative behavior toward wild-type p73 as well as p53 (10Yang A.

Recently, we (14Nakagawa T. Takahashi M. Ozaki T. Watanabe K. Todo S. Mizuguchi H. Hayakawa T. Nakagawara A. Mol. Cell.

Thus, the pro-apoptotic activity of p73 is determined by the relative expression levels of its TAp73 and dominant-negative ΔNp73 variants in cells. In sharp contrast to p53, it was initially reported that p73 was not induced by DNA damage (1Kaghad M. Bonnet H. Yang A. Creancier L. Biscan J.C. Valent A. Minty A. Chalon P. Lelias J.M. Dumont X. Ferrara P. McKeon F. Caput D. Cell. 1997; 90: 809-819Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1538) Google Scholar). However, recent studies demonstrated that, in response to a subset of DNA-damaging agents, p73 is positively regulated by multiple post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation and acetylation. During cisplatin-mediated apoptosis, phosphorylation of p73 at Tyr-99 by the non-receptor tyrosine kinase c-Abl results in an increase in its stability and pro-apoptotic activity (16Gong J.

Nature. 1999; 399: 814-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). In addition to c-Abl, the protein kinase Cδ catalytic fragment has the ability to phosphorylate p73 at Ser-289 and contributes to the accumulation of p73 during the apoptotic response to cisplatin treatment (19Ren J.

It is worth noting that the physical and functional interaction between c-Abl and protein kinase Cδ leads to the cross-activation of their kinase functions (20Yuan Z-M. Utsugisawa T. Ishiko T.

Furthermore, the enzymatic activity of Chk1 (checkpoint kinase-1) is enhanced in response to DNA damage (22Sanchez Y. Wong S. Thoma R.S. Richman R. Wu Z. Piwnica-Worms H. Elledge S.J.

Prives C. Cordon-Cardo C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 8161-8171Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Alternatively, Zeng et al. (26Zeng X. Li X. Miller A. Yuan Z. Yuan W. Kwok R.P. Goodman R. Lu H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1299-1310Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) found that the acetyltransferase p300/CBP (cAMP-responsive element-binding protein-binding protein) interacts with the N-terminal region of p73 and stimulates p73-mediated transcriptional activation and apoptosis. Recently, Costanzo et al. (27Costanzo A. Melro P. Pediconi N. Fulco M. Sartorelli V. Cole P.A. Fontemaggi G. Fanciulli M. Schiltz L. Blandino G. Balsano C. Levrero M. Mol.

Additionally, it has been shown that p300-mediated acetylation of p73 results in its significant stabilization in a prolyl isomerase Pin1-dependent manner (28Mantovani F. Piazza S. Gostissa M.

To identify cellular protein(s) that could interact with full-length p73α and regulate its function, we screened a human fetal brain cDNA library using a yeast two-hybrid method based on the Sos recruitment system. We report here that protein kinase A catalytic subunit β (PKA-Cβ) 1The abbreviations used are: PKA-C, protein kinase A catalytic subunit; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; GFP, green fluorescence protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase; HA, hemagglutinin; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; Bt2cAMP, dibutyryl cAMP. bound to p73α in cells, but not to p53, and that their interaction was mediated by the N- and C-terminal regions of p73α. In vitro kinase assays revealed that the catalytic subunit of PKA phosphorylated p73α. PKA-Cβ inhibited the p73α-mediated transcriptional activation of the p21WAF1 and Bax promoters and p73α-dependent apoptosis in response to camptothecin. On the other hand, the kinase-deficient mutant of PKA-Cβ had little effect on p73α. Of note, we found that PKA-Cβ facilitated the intramolecular interaction of p73α. Our results strongly suggest the PKA-Cβ-mediated phosphorylation and intramolecular interaction of p73 to be a novel inhibitory mechanism of p73 function. Cell Culture and Cell Lines—SV40-transformed African green monkey kidney cells (COS-7) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-incubated fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. p53-deficient human lung carcinoma H1299 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% heat-incubated fetal bovine serum and antibiotic mixture. The cells were cultured at 37 °C in a water-saturated atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2. Transient Transfection—COS-7 cells grown to 50–70% confluence in 60-mm dishes were transfected with the indicated expression plasmids using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science) following the protocol recommended by the manufacturer. H1299 cells transfection was performed using Lipofectamine 2000 transfection reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Yeast Two-hybrid Screening—The CytoTrap two-hybrid system was purchased from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). The cDNA encoding the full-length open reading frame of human p73α was amplified by PCR using pcDNA3-p73α as template. The PCR product, which was produced by additional upstream 5′-BamHI and downstream 3′-SalI restriction sites, was digested completely with BamHI and SalI; purified on agarose gel; and directly inserted in-frame into the identical restriction sites of pSos to give pSos-p73α. The resulting pSos-p73α“bait” plasmid was used to identify the cDNA encoding the p73α-binding protein from a human fetal brain cDNA library cloned into the pMyr plasmid (Stratagene). The screening was carried out according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, a temperature-sensitive yeast strain (cdc25Hα) was cotransformed with pSos-p73α and the cDNA library using the lithium acetate/heat shock procedure as described previously (29Watanabe K.

Transformants were allowed to grow on selection medium containing glucose for 2 days at 25 °C and then transferred onto selection medium containing galactose. Plasmid DNAs were isolated from the colonies exhibiting galactose-dependent growth at 37 °C and transformed into Escherichia coli. Finally, the nucleotide sequences of the positive cDNA clones were determined by the dideoxy terminator cycle sequencing using an ABI automated DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Western Blot Analysis—Transfected cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer A (25 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, and 1% Triton X-100) containing protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). After a brief sonication, whole cell lysates were centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C to remove insoluble materials, and the protein concentrations of the supernatants were determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay reagent. Protein samples were boiled in SDS sample buffer for 5 min, resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE, and transferred onto Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA). The membranes were blocked overnight with 50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.6), 100 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20 containing 5% nonfat dry milk and then incubated at room temperature for 1 h with anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody (M2, Sigma), anti-green fluorescence protein (GFP) monoclonal antibody (1E4, Medical and Biological Laboratories, Nagoya, Japan), anti-p53 monoclonal antibody (DO-1, Oncogene Research Products, Cambridge, MA), anti-p73 monoclonal antibody (Ab-4, NeoMarkers, Inc., Fremont, CA), anti-p21WAF1 monoclonal antibody (Ab-1, Oncogene Research Products), anti-PKA-Cα polyclonal antibody (C-20, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), or anti-PKA-Cβ polyclonal antibody (C-20, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), followed by incubation with the corresponding horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc., West Grove, PA). Following the last wash, horseradish peroxidase-labeled antibodies were detected using an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (ECL, Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Immunoprecipitation and Pull-down Assay—For immunoprecipitation, cell lysates were prepared in lysis buffer A. Equal amounts of protein extracts were pre-absorbed with protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h at 4 °C, and the precleared lysates were incubated with the indicated antibodies for 2 h at 4 °C, followed by incubation with protein G-Sepharose beads for an additional 1 h at 4 °C. The immune complexes were then washed three times with lysis buffer A, eluted by boiling in SDS sample buffer for 5 min, and subjected to Western blot analysis. For glutathione S-transferase (GST) pull-down assays, GST alone or the indicated GST-p73α fusion proteins were expressed in E. coli strain DH5α and loaded onto glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences). PKA-Cβ was generated in vitro in the presence of [35S]methionine using the TnT quick-coupled in vitro transcription/translation system (Promega Corp., Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 35S-Labeled PKA-Cβ was incubated with GST or GST-p73α fusion proteins bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads for 2 h at 4 °C in a total volume of 400 μl of binding buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40). Beads were washed extensively with the same buffer, and the radiolabeled proteins were eluted by boiling in SDS sample buffer for 5 min. Following electrophoresis, gels were destained, dried, and exposed to an x-ray film with an intensifying screen at –80 °C. Cell Fractionation—Transfected COS-7 cells were fractionated into nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions as described previously (30Nakamura Y. Ozaki T. Nakagawara A. Sakiyama S. Eur. J.

In brief, cells were washed twice with ice-cold 1× PBS and lysed in lysis buffer B containing 10 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitor mixture for 30 min at 4 °C. Cell lysates were centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C to separate soluble (cytoplasmic) from insoluble (nuclear) fractions. The pellets were washed extensively with lysis buffer B and further dissolved in 1× SDS sample buffer. The nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-lamin B monoclonal antibody (Ab-1, Oncogene Research Products) or with anti-α-tubulin monoclonal antibody (Ab-2, NeoMarkers, Inc.). Immunofluorescence Microscopy—H1299 cells were grown on coverslips and transiently cotransfected with the expression plasmids for hemagglutinin (HA)-p73α and FLAG-PKA-Cβ. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS for 30 min at room temperature and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 5 min. Nonspecific binding sites were blocked by treating cells with PBS containing 3% bovine serum albumin. The cells were incubated with anti-HA polyclonal and anti-FLAG monoclonal antibodies for 1 h, followed by incubation with fluorescein isothiocyanate- and rhodamine-conjugated secondary antibodies (Invitrogen). The coverslips were washed with PBS, mounted onto slides, and observed under a Fluoview laser scanning confocal microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). Luciferase Reporter Assay—p53-deficient H1299 cells (5 × 104 cells in a 12-well plate) were transiently cotransfected with a constant amount of the indicated expression plasmid (HA-p73α, HA-p73β, or p53), a p53/p73-responsive luciferase reporter construct (p21WAF1 or bax), and pRL-TK encoding Renilla luciferase with or without increasing amounts of the expression plasmid for FLAG-PKA-Cβ. The total amount of DNA was kept constant (510 ng) with pcDNA3 per transfection. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were lysed and assayed for luciferase activity using the Dual-Luciferase reporter assay system (Promega Corp.) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The transfection efficiency was normalized based on pRL-TK reporter activity. Reverse Transcription-PCR—H1299 cells were transiently cotransfected with the indicated combinations of expression plasmids. Twenty-four hours after transfection, total RNA was prepared using an RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen Inc.) according to the manufacturer's protocol. One microgram of total RNA was used to synthesize the first-strand cDNA using random primers and SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). Reverse transcription was carried out at 42 °C for 90 min, and reverse transcripts were amplified by standard PCR with rTaq DNA polymerase (Takara, Ohtsu, Japan). The primers used for PCR were as follows: p21WAF1, 5′-ATGAAATTCACCCCCTTTCC-3′ (sense) and 5′-CCCTAGGCTGTGCTCACTTC-3′ (antisense); and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, 5′-ACCTGACCTGCCGTCTAGAA-3′ (sense) and 5′-TCCACCACCCTGTTGCTGTA-3′ (antisense). PCR products were separated by 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis and stained with ethidium bromide. In Vitro Kinase Assays—GST or the indicated GST-p73α fusion proteins bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads were washed three times with kinase buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, and 12 mm MgCl2). The washed beads were incubated with 30 μl of kinase buffer containing 2 units of purified PKA catalytic subunit (Sigma), 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP for 30 min at 4 °C. The reaction mixtures were boiled in 2× SDS sample buffer for 5 min, and the proteins were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE. The gels were dried and processed for autoradiography. Cell Survival Assays—H1299 cells were seeded in 6-well plates and allowed to attach. Cells were then cotransfected with the indicated expression plasmids. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were exposed to camptothecin (final concentration of 1 μm) for 24 h. Cell viability was measured by a colorimetric assay with modified 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide as the substrate. Construction of a Kinase-deficient Mutant of PKA-Cβ—The K76R mutation was introduced into wild-type PKA-Cβ by PCR-based mutagenesis using PfuUltra™ high fidelity DNA polymerase (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The following oligonucleotide primers were used: 5′-AGGATCTTAGATAAGCAGAAGGTT-3′ (the underlined segment encodes Arg at position 76) and 5′-CATGGCATAATACTGTTCAGTGGCT-3′. This yielded the expression plasmid pcDNA3-FLAG-PKA-Cβ(K76R), which was completely sequenced by the dideoxy chain termination method. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP)—ChIP assays were performed following a protocol provided by Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). In brief, H1299 cells were transiently cotransfected with the expression plasmids for HA-p73α (1.2 μg) and FLAG-PKA-Cβ (4.8 μg). Thirty-six hours after transfection, cells were cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde in medium for 15 min at 37 °C. Cells were then washed with ice-cold PBS and resuspended in 200 μl of SDS-sample buffer containing protease inhibitor mixture. The suspension was sonicated 10 times for 30 s with a 1-min cooling period on ice between times and precleared with 20 μl of protein A-agarose beads blocked with sonicated salmon sperm DNA for 30 min at 4 °C. The beads were removed, and the chromatin solution was immunoprecipitated overnight with anti-HA monoclonal antibody at 4 °C, followed by incubation with protein A-agarose beads for an additional 1 h at 4 °C. The immune complexes were eluted with 100 μl of elution buffer (1% SDS and 0.1 m NaHCO3) and formaldehyde cross-links were reversed by heating at 65 °C for 6 h. Proteinase K was added to the reaction mixtures and incubated at 45 °C for 1 h. DNAs of the immunoprecipitates and control input DNAs were purified using a QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen Inc.) and then analyzed by regular PCR using the human p21WAF1 and bax promoter-specific primers. The primer sequences were 5′-CACCTTTCACCATTCCCCTA-3′ and 5′-GCAGCCCAAGGACAAAATAG-3′ for p21WAF1 and 5′-AAAGCTCAGAGGCCCAAAAT-3′ and 5′-AGGCTGAGACGGGGTTATCT-3′ for bax. Identification of PKA-Cβ as a Novel Binding Partner of p73— Because the conventional yeast two-hybrid system depends on the DNA binding as well as the transactivation function of Gal4, it is quite difficult to use a full-length transcriptional regulator with a transactivation domain as bait. To identify potential p73-interacting cellular protein(s), we used full-length p73α as bait in a new CytoTrap yeast two-hybrid screen relying on the Sos recruitment system. A temperature-sensitive yeast strain (cdc25Hα) was cotransformed with a bait plasmid and a human fetal brain cDNA library. Of a total of 1 × 106 primary transformants grown on medium containing glucose at 30 °C, one clone (termed F115) exhibited galactose-dependent growth at 37 °C. The plasmid DNA derived from the cDNA library was introduced into E. coli, and its nucleotide sequence was determined. Sequence analysis revealed that the F115 cDNA clone encodes full-length PKA-Cβ. Of the PKA catalytic subunit isoforms (PKA-Cα, PKA-Cβ, and PKA-Cγ), PKA-Cβ is highly expressed in brain and reproductive tissues, whereas PKA-Cα is ubiquitously expressed in mammalian tissues (31Uhler M.D. Chrivia J.C.

PKA-Cβ Associates with p73 in Mammalian Cultured Cells—To confirm the interaction between PKA-Cβ and p73 detected by the CytoTrap yeast two-hybrid system, co-immunoprecipitation experiments were carried out using whole cell lysates prepared from COS-7 cells expressing exogenous FLAG-PKA-Cβ and HA-p73α. As shown in Fig. 1A, the anti-FLAG immunoprecipitates contained HA-p73α. Used as a control, HA-p73α was not detectable in the anti-FLAG immunoprecipitates of COS-7 cells expressing FLAG-PKA-Cβ or HA-p73α alone. Analysis of the anti-HA immunoprecipitates also demonstrated that FLAG-PKA-Cβ co-immunoprecipitated with HA-p73α. Next, we examined whether endogenous PKA-Cβ could interact with p73α. To this end, whole cell lysates prepared from COS-7 cells transfected with the expression plasmid for FLAG-p73α were immunoprecipitated with normal rabbit serum or with the specific antibody against PKA-Cβ, followed by immunoblotting with anti-FLAG antibody. As shown in Fig. 1B (upper panels), FLAG-p73α co-immunoprecipitated with endogenous PKA-Cβ. Because the amino acid sequences of PKA-Cα and PKA-Cβ are 91% identical (31Uhler M.D. Chrivia J.C. McKnight G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15360-15463Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we examined whether endogenous PKA-Cα could bind to p73α. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that, like PKA-Cβ, endogenous PKA-Cα associated with FLAG-p73α (Fig. 1B, lower panels). In sharp contrast to p73α, p53 failed to interact with FLAG-PKA-Cβ under our experimental conditions (Fig. 1C). To investigate the subcellular distribution of PKA-Cβ in the presence of exogenous p73α, we employed the biochemical fractionation of transfected H1299 cells. H1299 cells transiently cotransfected with the expression plasmids for HA-p73α and FLAG-PKA-Cβ were fractionated into nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions, and the fractions obtained were subjected to immunoblotting with the indicated antibodies. The purity of the nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions was verified by immunoblotting with anti-lamin B and anti-α-tubulin antibodies, respectively. As shown in Fig. 1D, HA-p73α was detected exclusively in the nuclear fractions, whereas FLAG-PKA-Cβ and endogenous PKA-Cβ and PKA-Cα were present in both the cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions. As expected, confocal microscopy of immunostained H1299 cells expressing FLAG-PKA-Cβ and HA-p73α revealed that both proteins co-localized in the cell nucleus (Fig. 1E). Identification of the Interacting Region within p73—To examine which region(s) of p73 could be engaged in the interaction with PKA-Cβ, we performed co-immunoprecipitation and GST pull-down experiments. Fig. 2A depicts the domain structures of various p73 variants used for co-immunoprecipitation experiments. Whole cell lysates prepared from H1299 cells transiently cotransfected with the indicated combinations of expression plasmids were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody, followed by immunoblotting with anti-p73 antibody. As shown in Fig. 2B, HA-p73α and ΔNp73α co-purified with FLAG-PKA-Cβ, whereas the binding of HA-p73β to FLAG-PKA-Cβ was significantly weaker than seen with HA-p73α and ΔNp73α, suggesting that the C-terminal region of p73α might be required for the interaction with PKA-Cβ. To verify these results, in vitro GST pull-down assays were carried out using a series of GST-p73α fusion proteins. In vitro translated 35S-labeled FLAG-PKA-Cβ was incubated with glutathione-Sepharose beads complexed either with GST alone or with GST-p73α. The autoradiogram in Fig. 2C (upper panel) shows that GST-p73α-(1–130) and GST-p73α-(469–636) were able to interact with FLAG-PKA-Cβ. The Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining shown in Fig. 2C (lower panel) revealed that the glutathione"

Myc, a basic region-helix-loop-helix-leucine zipper (bHLHZip) protein, functions as a transcriptional regulator. Transcriptional activation is antagonized by Mad bHLHZip proteins that include Mad1, Mxi1, Mad3, and Mad4. These proteins, in contrast to Myc, inhibit proliferation and repress transformation (4Rottmann S. Luscher B. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2005; (in press)Google Scholar). Myeloid precursor cells of mad1-deficient mice show ectopic cell divisions prior to differentiation and hyperplastic alterations in several tissues were observed in mxi1-deficient mice (5Foley K.P.

Cordon-Cardo C. Lee H.W. DePinho R.A. Nature. 1998; 393: 483-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Inhibition of proliferation requires that Mad proteins interact with Max and with a mSin3-histone deacetylase (HDAC) repressor complex, which is recruited through the N-terminal mSin3-interaction domain (SID) (4Rottmann S. Luscher B. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2005; (in press)Google Scholar). Together these findings suggest that Mad proteins affect proliferation by modulating chromatin structure of target genes. Several HDAC-dependent corepressor complexes have been described in mammalian cells (7Narlikar G.J. Fan H.Y. Kingston R.E. Cell. 2002; 108: 475-487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1228) Google Scholar). The mSin3-HDAC repressor complex that is recruited by Mad proteins contains more than 10 subunits, including the two histone deacetylases HDAC1 and HDAC2 (4Rottmann S. Luscher B. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2005; (in press)Google Scholar). These two enzymes show a high degree of sequence similarity and are substrates for kinases implying signal-dependent regulation (8de Ruijter A.J. van Gennip A.H. Caron H.N. Kemp S. van Kuilenburg A.B. Biochem. J. 2003; 370: 737-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (2386) Google Scholar). However, little additional information is available about the regulation of the mSin3-HDAC repressor complex. Defining its regulation will be important not only to understand Mad function in more detail but to obtain insight into the function of the complex and the associated HDACs in cell behavior control. To obtain novel insight into the regulation of Mad1 function in the control of cell proliferation we further characterized the role of this protein in the G1 to S phase transition. Mad1 blocks this transition dependent on its ability to recruit the mSin3-repressor complex and to interact with its heterodimeric partner Max. We observed that cyclin E/CDK2, but not other cyclin/CDKs, overcame Mad1-dependent inhibition of cell cycle progression. This was due to a direct effect on the Mad1-repressor complex. Cyclin E/CDK2 interfered with Mad1-dependent transcriptional repression and with the HDAC activity of the corepressor complex, at least in part as a consequence of resolving the complex. Together our findings provide a novel link between HDAC-dependent gene repression and cell cycle control. Cell Culture—3T3-L1, NIH3T3, SAOS2, and COS7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and RK-13 cells in minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) and penicillin/streptomycin. Quiescent 3T3-L1 cells were obtained by starvation for 36 h in medium containing 0.1% FCS. After injection quiescent cells were stimulated by the addition of FCS (final concentration of 10%). To monitor DNA synthesis cells were incubated in the presence of 100 μm bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd, Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany). SAOS2 colony formation assays were performed as described previously (9Sommer A. Hilfenhaus S. Menkel A. Kremmer E. Seiser C. Loidl P. Luscher B. Curr.

Antibodies recognizing Mad1 (C-19), mSin3B (AK-12), cyclin E (M-20), and cyclin A (C-19) were from Santa Cruz. Antibodies recognizing BrdUrd were from Fitzgerald. Transient Transfections—Transient transfections of NIH3T3, RK-13, and COS7 cells were performed using calcium phosphate coprecipitation as described previously (22Bouchard C. Thieke K. Maier A.

Preparation of Active Cyclin E/CDK2 Complexes and Kinase Assays— Expression and purification of human cyclin E/CDK2 complexes from insect cells infected with recombinant baculoviruses were carried out as described previously (24Sarcevic B.

Cyclin E/CDK2 activity was measured using histone H1 as substrate. 1 unit of cyclin E/CDK2 activity transferred 1 pmol of phosphate onto 5 μg of histone H1 in kinase buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.01% Tween 20, 10 mm NaF, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm orthovanadate, 0.01% bovine serum albumin) containing 25 μm ATP in 30 min. Kinase reactions with immunopurified HDAC complexes were performed with 5 unit of cyclin E/CDK2 as above for 15 min. FCS-synchronized NIH3T3-L1 cells were harvested in F-buffer at the times indicated. Protein concentrations of the different samples were determined using the Bradford protein assay. CDK complexes were immunopurified from aliquots with equal protein concentration using antibodies specific for cyclin E or A. Kinase reactions were performed in kinase buffer (50 mm HEPES pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2.5 mm EGTA, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate) containing 1 μg of histone H1 and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP at 30 °C for 15 min. Coimmunoprecipitation Experiments—Relevant proteins were expressed in COS7 or HEK293 cells and the complexes immunoprecipitated from F-buffer whole cell lysates. The components of the complexes were analyzed by Western blotting. Mad1 Inhibits Entry into S Phase until Late in G1—We have shown previously that Mad1 inhibits serum-induced S phase entry in fibroblasts (9Sommer A. Hilfenhaus S. Menkel A. Kremmer E. Seiser C. Loidl P. Luscher B. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 357-365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). To determine domains in Mad1 important for this function, plasmids expressing different mutants were injected into quiescent 3T3-L1 fibroblasts and progression into S phase was measured by BrdUrd incorporation. Mad1 efficiently blocked progression into S phase (Fig. 1, A and B). This was dose-dependent, and similar effects were measured in Swiss3T3 and primary rat embryo fibroblasts (data not shown). Mutants lacking either the N terminus including the SID (Mad1ΔN) or the leucine zipper (Mad1ΔZip) were unable to inhibit S phase progression, while the C-terminal domain (Mad1ΔC) was dispensable (Fig. 1, A and B). This suggests that heterodimerization with Max and recruitment of an mSin3-HDAC corepressor complex are required to inhibit entry into S phase. This is comparable with the requirements to inhibit cell proliferation and transformation (10Cerni C. Bousset K. Seelos C. Burkhardt H. Henriksson M. Luscher B. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 587-596PubMed Google Scholar, 11Roussel M.F. Ashmun R.A. Sherr C.J. Eisenman R.N. Ayer D.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2796-2801Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). To determine until when in the G1 phase Mad1 was able to inhibit S phase progression, quiescent fibroblasts were serum stimulated and then microinjected with Mad1-expressing plasmids at different times. BrdUrd-positive cells were determined 20 h after serum addition (Fig. 1C, closed circles). Mad1 efficiently inhibited progression into S phase up to 8.5 h after serum stimulation. At later time points an increasing proportion of Mad1-expressing cells entered S phase, reaching control levels by 12 h. The time requirement of control cells to enter S phase after serum stimulation was determined by BrdUrd pulse labeling of cells on parallel coverslips (Fig. 1C, bars). By 12 h 50% of control cells had entered S phase. Taking into account a delay of 30 min to allow for efficient protein synthesis following microinjection these data suggest that Mad1 was capable of inhibiting entry into S phase until late in G1. This coincided with the activation of cyclin E-associated kinase activity whereas cyclin A-associated kinase activity appeared later (Fig. 1D). These findings indicate that Mad1 can no longer inhibit S phase once cyclin E/CDK2 is activated. Cyclin E/CDK2 Antagonizes Mad1-dependent Inhibition of Proliferation—Next we addressed whether cyclin E/CDK2 can interfere with the ability of Mad1 to inhibit S phase progression. Coexpression of cyclin E/CDK2, but not other cyclin/CDK complexes, was able to overcome the Mad1-dependent block of S phase progression (Fig. 2A). The inability of cyclin D/CDK complexes to antagonize Mad1 function was corroborated by the finding that coexpression of E1A was not sufficient to overcome the Mad1 block (data not shown). This indicates that the retinoblastoma protein, which controls the restriction point, is not involved in this regulation (12Ho A. Dowdy S.F. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2002; 12: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The cyclin E/CDK2 effect was dependent on kinase activity, since cyclin E/dominant negative CDK2 could not rescue (data not shown). To further evaluate the functional antagonism of Mad1 and cyclin E/CDK2 we performed colony formation assays. As for S phase progression cyclin E/CDK2 could overcome the Mad1-dependent inhibition of colony formation in SAOS2, U2OS, and NIH3T3 cells (Fig. 2, B and C, and data not shown). Thus in these different experimental settings cyclin E/CDK2 abolished Mad1-dependent inhibition of cell proliferation. Cyclin E/CDK2 Interferes with Mad1-dependent Gene Repression—Two fundamentally different possibilities can be envisaged about how cyclin E/CDK2 antagonizes Mad1. First, cyclin E/CDK2 might directly affect the function of Mad1 and its associated repressor complex. Second, cyclin E/CDK2 might function downstream of Mad1. While the second possibility is difficult to address due to the lack of known Mad1-regulated effectors (4Rottmann S. Luscher B. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2005; (in press)Google Scholar), the first implies that cyclin E/CDK2 may interfere with Mad1-dependent repression of gene transcription. Indeed repression of a cyclin D2-reporter gene construct by Mad1 was abolished by cyclin E/CDK2 (Fig. 3A). This required CDK2 kinase activity, and similar to S phase progression, cyclin D and A complexes were inactive (Fig. 3B). One possible explanation for these findings is that cyclin E/CDK2 negatively regulates Mad1/Max DNA binding. However, neither of the two proteins was substrate of nor was DNA binding affected by this kinase (data not shown). Consistently repression by Gal-MadN35, a fusion protein of the Mad1 SID and the Gal4 DNA binding domain (13Ayer D.E. Laherty C.D. Lawrence Q.A. Armstrong A.P. Eisenman R.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5772-5781Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), and by Gal-Sin3 was also relieved by cyclin E/CDK2 (Fig. 3C). In contrast Gal-MadN35(Pro), which contains an inactivating mutation in the SID, did not repress and was not affected by cyclin E/CDK2 (Fig. 3C). Thus this kinase inhibits Mad1-dependent gene repression without directly phosphorylating Mad1 or Max. Cyclin E/CDK2 Inhibits HDAC Activity—To address whether cyclin E/CDK2 affects the Mad-HDAC-repressor complex, a tagged version of HDAC1 was coexpressed with this kinase, and deacetylase activity was measured. Cyclin E/CDK2, but not cyclin D1/CDK4, resulted in a reduction of HDAC activity. In contrast coexpression of p27Kip1, either with or without cyclin E/CDK2, or CDK2dn stimulated HDAC activity (Fig. 3D). Next we evaluated the effect of cyclin E/CDK2 on deacetylase activity in vitro. Immunoprecipitated, overexpressed HDAC activity, recruited through Mad1 or by using antibodies specific for the HDAC-associated tag, was inhibited upon phosphorylation by recombinant cyclin E/CDK2 (Fig. 3E). Together these findings suggest that cyclin E/CDK2 negatively regulates HDAC activity through phosphorylation of one or several components of the repressor complex. This is further supported by the observation that cyclin E interacted with the HDAC complex in coimmunoprecipitations (Fig. 3F) and that cyclin E bound directly to HDAC1 in glutathione S-transferase pull-down assays (data not shown). In an effort to identify cyclin E/CDK2 substrates associated with the HDAC complex we performed kinase assays with recombinant cyclin E/CDK2 with immunoprecipitated repressor complex as substrate. We detected HDAC1 as substrate and identified Ser346 as the main in vitro cyclin E/CDK2 phosphorylation site. However, cell derived repressor complexes, with HDAC1 mutated at Ser346 to Ala, were still sensitive to cyclin E/CDK2 (data not shown). This indicated that HDAC1 is either not the critical substrate or that other proteins need to be phosphorylated within the repressor complex in addition to HDAC1 for the observed phenotype. Further studies are designed to address this issue. The Mad1-Repressor Complex Is Sensitive to Cyclin E/CDK2— In addition to the reduction of HDAC activity in response to cyclin E/CDK2, we also observed that this kinase altered the interaction of the repressor complex with Mad1. HDAC1 was coimmunoprecipitated with Mad1 and vice versa. This interaction was substantially reduced when cyclin E/CDK2 was coexpressed (Fig. 3G). Since Mad1 is not phosphorylated by cyclin E/CDK2, mSin3 might serve as substrate that could explain the above described effect. Indeed this protein has several potential CDK phosphorylation sites. However, in vitro kinase assays identified mSin3 as a poor cyclin E/CDK2 substrate that was not further analyzed. Together these findings suggest that the activity of the Mad1-repressor complex is inhibited in response to cyclin E/CDK2 due to at least two distinct events. This includes loss of binding of the repressor complex to Mad1 and inhibition of HDAC activity. Conclusions—Our findings have uncovered a functional interaction between cyclin E/CDK2, a component of the machinery that regulates the transition from the G1 into the S phase of the cell cycle, with the Mad1-mSin3-HDAC repressor complex. We demonstrate that cyclin E/CDK2 overcomes the Mad1-induced block to S phase progression by interfering with the ability of Mad1 to repress genes. This is the result of a cyclin E/CDK2-dependent dismantling of the Mad1-mSin3A-HDAC1 repressor complex and of inhibition of the HDAC activity associated with the repressor complex. Other cyclin-dependent kinases did not influence the activities of Mad1 suggesting that cyclin E/CDK2 has a unique function in repressing the Mad1 repressor complex. Cyclin E/CDK2 is essential for S phase progression in both RB-positive and RB-negative cells. This implies that this kinase has some critical substrates, in addition to RB, that control the transition from G1 into S phase (14Keyomarsi K. Herliczek T.W. Prog. Cell Cycle Res. 1997; 3: 171-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). In support cyclin E/CDK2 has been shown to bypass the requirement for E2F activity (15Alevizopoulos K. Vlach J. Hennecke S. Amati B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5322-5333Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 16Lukas J. Herzinger T. Hansen K. Moroni M.C. Resnitzky D. Helin K. Reed S.I. Bartek J. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1479-1492Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). This suggests strongly that cyclin E/CDK2 regulates substrates that are rate-limiting for S phase entry, which are not targeted by cyclin D complexes. Some of these substrates, including the CDK inhibitor p27KIP1, nucleophosmin/B23, Mps1, and CP110, have been identified in recent years and play important roles for various processes at the G1 to S phase transition (17Fisk H.A.

Cell. 2002; 3: 339-350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Furthermore the cyclin E/CDK2 substrate NPAT is associated with the activation of histone gene transcription at the beginning of S phase (21Zhao J. Kennedy B.K. Lawrence B.D. Barbie D.A. Matera A.G. Fletcher J.A. Harlow E. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2283-2297Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Our findings expand these observations by defining that the mSin3-HDAC repressor complex is targeted by cyclin E/CDK2 suggesting that additional as yet undefined substrates are involved in the regulation of gene transcription at the G1 to S phase transition.

https://openalex.org/W2017121407,"The expression of a previously untranslated carboxylterminal sequence is associated with the ancestral lutropin (LH) β to the β-subunit gene evolution of choriogonadotropins (CG). The peptide extension (denoted as CTP) is rich in mucin-type <i>O-</i>glycans and confers new hormonal properties on CG relative to the LH. Although the LHβ gene is conserved among mammals and only a few frameshift mutations account for the extension, it is merely seen in primates and equids. Bioinformatics identified a CTP-like sequence that is encrypted in the LHβ gene of several mammalian species but not in birds, amphibians, or fish. We then examined whether or not decoding of the cryptic CTP in the bovine LHβ gene (boCTP) would be sufficient to generate the LHβ species of a ruminant with properties typical to the CGβ subunit. The mutated bovine LHβ-boCTP subunit was expressed and <i>N-</i>glycosylated in transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells. However, unlike human (h) CGβ CTP, the cryptic boCTP was devoid of mucin <i>O</i>-glycans. This deficiency was further confirmed when the boCTP domain was substituted for the natural CTP in the human CGβ subunit. Moreover, when expressed in polarized Madin-Darby canine kidney cells, this hCGβ-boCTP chimera was secreted basolaterally rather than from the apical compartment, which is the route of the wild type hCGβ subunit, a sorting function attributed to the <i>O</i>-glycans attached to the CTP. This result shows that the cryptic peptide does not orientate CG to the apical face of the placenta, to the maternal circulation as seen in primates. The absence of this function, which distinguishes CG from LH, provides an explanation as to why the LHβ to CGβ evolution did not occur in ruminants. We propose that in primates and equids, further natural mutations in the progenitor LHβ gene resulted in the efficient <i>O</i>-glycosylation of the CTP, thus favoring the retention of an elongated reading frame."
