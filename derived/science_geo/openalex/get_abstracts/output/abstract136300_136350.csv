https://openalex.org/W1852348769,"This study demonstrates the involvement of the MT2 (Mel1b) melatonin receptor in mediating phase advances of circadian activity rhythms by melatonin. In situ hybridization histochemistry with digoxigenin-labeled oligonucleotide probes revealed for the first time the expression of mt1 and MT2 melatonin receptor mRNA within the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the C3H/HeN mouse. Melatonin (0.9 to 30 μg/mouse, s.c.) administration during 3 days at the end of the subjective day (CT 10) to C3H/HeN mice kept in constant dark phase advanced circadian rhythms of wheel running activity in a dose-dependent manner [EC50 = 0.72 μg/mouse; 0.98 ± 0.08 h (n = 15) maximal advance at 9 μg/mouse]. Neither the selective MT2 melatonin receptor antagonists 4P-ADOT and 4P-PDOT (90 μ/mouse, s.c.) nor luzindole (300 μg/mouse, s.c.), which shows 25-fold higher affinity for the MT2 than the mt1 subtype, affected the phase of circadian activity rhythms when given alone at CT 10. All three antagonists, however, shifted to the right the dose-response curve to melatonin, as they significantly reduced the phase shifting effects of 0.9 and 3 mg melatonin. This is the first study to demonstrate that melatonin phase advances circadian rhythms by activation of a membrane-bound melatonin receptor and strongly suggests that this effect is mediated through the MT2 melatonin receptor subtype within the circadian timing system. We conclude that the MT2 melatonin receptor subtype is a novel therapeutic target for the development of subtype-selective analogs for the treatment of circadian sleep and mood-related disorders.—Dubocovich, M.

https://openalex.org/W2162390651,"P-selectin mediates rolling of neutrophils and other leukocytes on activated endothelial cells and platelets through binding to P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1). Certain PSGL-1 negative tumor cell lines can bind P-selectin under static conditions through the GPI-linked surface mucin, CD24, but the physiological significance of this interaction and whether it can occur under flow conditions is not known. Here, we show that CD24+ PSGL-1- KS breast carcinoma cells attach to and roll on recombinant P-selectin under a continuous wall shear stress, although at a lower density and higher velocity than CD24+ PSGL-1+ cells, such as HL-60. Adding excess soluble CD24 or removing CD24 from the cell surface with phosphatidylinositol-phospholipase C (PI-PLC) significantly reduced KS cell rolling on P-selectin. The ability of KS cells to roll on P-selectin was positively correlated with the CD24 expression level. Comparison with three other CD24+ cell lines established that expression of sialyl-Lewis(x) antigen was also necessary for CD24-mediated rolling on P-selectin. CD24 purified from KS cells supported rolling of P-selectin transfectants, but not L-selectin transfectants. Finally, KS cells rolled on vascular endothelium in vivo in a P-selectin-dependent manner. Together our data show that CD24 serves as a ligand for P-selectin under physiological flow conditions. Interaction of tumor cells with P-selectin via CD24 may be an important adhesion pathway in cancer metastasis."

https://openalex.org/W1921428702,"Hypertension increases mechanical force on the arterial wall by as much as 30%, resulting in marked alterations in signal transductions and gene expression in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) that contribute to matrix protein synthesis, cell proliferation, and differentiation. How the mechanical stimuli are converted into a biological signal in cells has yet to be studied. We investigated the role of both cyclic strain and shear stresses in initiating the cellular signaling on cultured VSMCs and found that mechanical forces evoked activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases, followed by enhanced DNA binding activity of transcription factor AP-1. Physical forces rapidly induced phosphorylation of platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) alpha, an activated state. When GRB2, an adapter protein, was immunoprecipitated from treated VSMCs followed by Western blot analysis with anti-phosphotyrosine, -PDGFR alpha, and -GRB2 antibodies, respectively, phosphotyrosine positive staining was observed on PDGFR alpha bands of the same blot in stretch-stressed VSMCs, supporting the mechanical stress-induced activation of PDGFR alpha. Conditioned medium from stretch-stressed VSMCs did not result in PDGFR alpha phosphorylation, and antibodies binding to all forms of PDGFs did not block stress-induced PDGFR alpha activation. Thus, mechanical stresses may directly perturb the cell surface or alter receptor conformation, thereby initiating signaling pathways normally used by growth factors."

Previous investigations determined that mice deficient in selenium developed myocarditis when infected with a benign strain of coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3/0). To determine whether this effect was mediated by GPX-1, mice with a disrupted Gpx1 gene (Gpx1-/-) were infected with CVB3/0. Gpx1-/- mice developed myocarditis after CVB3/0 infection, whereas infected wild-type mice (Gpx1+/+) were resistant. Sequencing of viruses recovered from Gpx1(-/-)-infected mice demonstrated seven nucleotide changes in the viral genome, of which three occurred at the G residue, the most easily oxidized base. No changes were found in virus isolated from Gpx1+/+ mice. These results demonstrate that GPX-1 provides protection against viral-induced damage in vivo due to mutations in the viral genome of a benign virus."

https://openalex.org/W2057491541,"Coelomic fluid of Eisenia foetida earthworms contains a 42-kDa protein named coelomic cytolytic factor 1 (CCF-1) that was described previously to be involved in cytolytic, opsonizing, and hemolytic properties of the coelomic fluid. Cloning and sequencing of CCF-1 reveal significant homology with the putative catalytic region of beta-1,3- and beta-1,3-1,4-glucanases. CCF-1 also displays homology with coagulation factor G from Limulus polyphemus and with Gram-negative bacteria-binding protein of Bombyx mori silkworm, two proteins involved in invertebrate defense mechanisms. We show that CCF-1 efficiently binds both beta-1,3-glucan and lipopolysaccharide. Moreover, CCF-1 participates in the activation of prophenoloxidase cascade via recognition of yeast and Gram-negative bacteria cell wall components. These results suggest that the 42-kDa CCF-1 protein of E. foetida coelomic fluid likely plays a role in the protection of earthworms against microbes."

https://openalex.org/W1964437432,"Skeletal and cardiac muscles express distinct isoforms of the dihydropyridine receptor (DHPR), a type of voltage-gated Ca2+ channel that is important for excitation-contraction (EC) coupling. However, entry of Ca2+ through the channel is not required for skeletal muscle-type EC coupling. Previous work (Tanabe, T., Beam, K. G., Adams, B. A., Niidome, T., and Numa, S. (1990) Nature346, 567–569) revealed that the loop between repeats II and III (II-III loop) is an important determinant of skeletal-type EC coupling. In the present study we have further dissected the regions of the II-III loop critical for skeletal-type EC coupling by expression of cDNA constructs in dysgenic myotubes. Because Ser687 of the skeletal II-III loop has been reported to be rapidly phosphorylatedin vitro, we substituted this serine with alanine, the corresponding cardiac residue. This alanine-substituted skeletal DHPR retained the ability to mediate skeletal-type EC coupling. Weak skeletal-type EC coupling was produced by a chimeric DHPR, which was entirely cardiac except for a small amount of skeletal sequence (residues 725–742) in the II-III loop. Skeletal-type coupling was stronger when both residues 725–742 and adjacent residues were skeletal (e.g. a chimera containing skeletal residues 711–765). However, residues 725–742 appeared to be critical because skeletal-type coupling was not produced either by a chimera with skeletal residues 711–732 or by one with skeletal residues 734–765.

Dihydropyridine receptors (DHPRs)1 in skeletal and cardiac muscle are closely related proteins encoded by two different genes (1Tanabe T. Takeshima H. Mikami A. Flockerzi V. Takahashi H. Kangawa K.

Science. 1989; 244: 800-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar) as voltage-gated, L-type Ca2+ channels and as a trigger for excitation-contraction (EC) coupling, which controls the release of Ca2+ through ryanodine receptors (RyRs) (7McPherson P.S. Campbell K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13765-13768Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in the sarcoplasmic reticulum. However, the mechanism of EC coupling is different in cardiac and skeletal muscle. In cardiac muscle, depolarization causes opening of L-type Ca2+ channels, and the resulting entry of extracellular Ca2+ triggers RyRs to release Ca2+ (6Nabauer M. Callewaert G. Cleemann L. Morad M. Science. 1989; 244: 800-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). In skeletal muscle, EC coupling does not require Ca2+ entry (8Armstrong C.M. Bezanilla F.M. Horowicz P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 267: 605-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar); rather, depolarization causes some other kind of signal to be transmitted from DHPRs to RyRs. To identify regions that are critical for this skeletal-type EC coupling, we have previously used the approach of constructing cDNAs encoding chimeras of the skeletal and cardiac DHPRs (3Tanabe T. Beam K.G. Adams B.A. Niidome T. Numa S. Nature. 1990; 346: 567-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). Expression of these chimeric DHPRs in dysgenic myotubes, which lack a functional gene for the skeletal DHPR (9Chaudhari N. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25636-25639Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), revealed that the putative cytoplasmic region between repeats II and III (II-III loop, amino acids 666–791) of the skeletal DHPR is an important determinant of skeletal-type EC coupling (3Tanabe T. Beam K.G. Adams B.A. Niidome T. Numa S. Nature. 1990; 346: 567-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). Comparison of the skeletal and cardiac DHPRs reveals differences scattered throughout the II-III loops. One important difference is the presence of a site (Ser687) in the skeletal II-III loop, which is phosphorylated by cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) (1Tanabe T. Takeshima H. Mikami A. Flockerzi V. Takahashi H. Kangawa K. Kojima M. Matsuo H. Hirose T. Numa S. Nature. 1987; 328: 313-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar, 10Rohrkasten A. Meyer H.E. Nastainczyk W. Sieber M. Hofmann F. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15325-15329Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and is lacking in the cardiac loop (2Mikami A. Imoto K. Tanabe T. Niidome T. Mori Y. Takeshima H. Narumiya S. Numa S. Nature. 1989; 340: 230-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar). Another important difference is the presence of a 12-amino acid insertion in the N-terminal half of the cardiac II-III loop. To determine the importance of these and other amino acid differences for skeletal-type EC coupling, we have now examined a skeletal DHPR in which Ser687 was mutated to alanine and also analyzed chimeric DHPRs in which skeletal sequence was substituted for successively smaller portions of the II-III loop of the cardiac DHPR. We found that removal of the serine phosphorylation site did not alter the function of the skeletal DHPR and that a small region slightly toward the C-terminal half from the midpoint of the II-III loop was critical for the ability of chimeric DHPRs to mediate skeletal-type EC coupling. The results are discussed in light of work from other laboratories in which the function of isolated RyRs was assayed during exposure to peptide fragments corresponding to various regions of the skeletal and cardiac DHPRs (11Lu X.

The expression plasmids encoding the chimeric DHPRs were constructed using PCR-amplified fragments, already existing restriction sites, and new restriction sites introduced by site-directed mutagenesis (16Sayers J.R. Eckstein F. Creighton T.E. Protein Function: A Practical Approach. IRL, Oxford1989: 279-295Google Scholar) and PCR; the nucleotide changes used to introduce the new restriction sites were selected so as not to alter the amino acid sequence present in the cDNA inserts of the expression plasmids pCAC6 (4Tanabe T. Beam K.G. Powell J.A. Numa S. Nature. 1988; 336: 134-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar) and pCARD1 (2Mikami A. Imoto K. Tanabe T. Niidome T. Mori Y. Takeshima H. Narumiya S. Numa S.

To construct pCAC6-S687A, a mutation (T2059G) was introduced into pCAC6 by PCR. Primary cultures of dysgenic myotubes were prepared and injected with plasmid DNA as described previously (4Tanabe T. Beam K.G. Powell J.A. Numa S. Nature. 1988; 336: 134-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar). Cells expressing the injected plasmid were identified by contraction in response to extracellular stimulation (4Tanabe T. Beam K.G. Powell J.A. Numa S. Nature. 1988; 336: 134-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar). The whole-cell patch clamp technique (18Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.J. Pflügers Arch. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15145) Google Scholar) was used in combination with a photomultiplier system to allow the simultaneous measurement of membrane currents and Ca2+ transients 1–4 days after plasmid injection (19Garcı́a J. Tanabe T. Beam K.G. J. Gen. Physiol. 1994; 103: 125-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The patch pipette contained (mm): 140 Cs-aspartate, 5 MgCl2, 10 Cs2EGTA (20 nm free Ca2+), 5 Na2ATP, 0.2 pentapotassium-Fluo-3 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), and 10 HEPES (pH 7.4 with CsOH). The bath solution contained (mm): 145 tetraethylammonium+, 165 Cl−, 10 HEPES (pH 7.4 with CsOH), 0.003 tetrodotoxin, and either 10 Ca2+ (to support Ca2+ current) or 2 Ca2+, 8 Mg2+, 0.5 Cd2+, and 0.3 La3+ (to block Ca2+ current). The voltage clamp command sequence was to step from the holding potential (−80 mV) to −50 mV for 25–30 ms, to the test potential for 15 ms, to −50 mV for 25–30 ms, and back to the holding potential. The parameters G′max,V′½, and k′ were determined from the slow calcium current as described previously (19Garcı́a J. Tanabe T. Beam K.G. J. Gen. Physiol. 1994; 103: 125-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Because there was large variability in magnitude of the calcium transients, the transients were not analyzed quantitatively, except to determine the “strength” of skeletal-type EC coupling, which was defined for each chimera as the ratio of the number of cells with a measurable Ca2+ transient in Cd2+/La3+solution to the number of cells with a transient in 10 mmCa2+-containing solution. Additionally, traces selected for illustration are representative in terms of time course but not necessarily in terms of magnitude. Temperature was 20–22 °C. Fig. 1 schematically illustrates the skeletal muscle and cardiac DHPRs, designated CAC6 (4Tanabe T. Beam K.G. Powell J.A. Numa S.

Nature. 1990; 346: 567-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar), which has a skeletal II-III loop but otherwise has cardiac sequence. The skeletal II-III loop is 138 amino acids in length, whereas the cardiac II-III loop is 147 amino acids in length (1Tanabe T. Takeshima H. Mikami A. Flockerzi V. Takahashi H. Kangawa K. Kojima M. Matsuo H. Hirose T. Numa S. Nature. 1987; 328: 313-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar, 2Mikami A. Imoto K. Tanabe T. Niidome T. Mori Y. Takeshima H. Narumiya S. Numa S. Nature. 1989; 340: 230-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar). In the skeletal muscle II-III loop, Ser687 is phosphorylated in vitro by PKA (10Rohrkasten A. Meyer H.E. Nastainczyk W. Sieber M. Hofmann F. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15325-15329Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); alanine occurs at the corresponding position (residue 809) of the cardiac II-III loop. To test for the importance of this PKA site, we constructed a mutant skeletal DHPR (S687A) in which Ser687was replaced by an alanine. Intracellular Ca2+ transients in response to depolarization were recorded in dysgenic myotubes expressing CAC6, S687A, CARD1, and CSk3 with the cells bathed first in a solution containing 10 mm Ca2+ (Fig. 1, center column) and then in a solution containing Cd2+plus La3+ to block the entry of extracellular Ca2+ (Fig. 1, right-hand column). Blocking the entry of extracellular Ca2+ abolished the intracellular Ca2+ transient for constructs mediating cardiac-type EC coupling (CARD1 trace). For constructs mediating skeletal-type EC coupling (e.g. CAC6), the Ca2+transient was still present (although decreased in amplitude) after Ca2+ entry had been blocked by the addition of Cd2+ and La3+. The decreased amplitude of the Ca2+ transient (i.e.ΔF/F) has been previously described for normal myotubes exposed to inorganic Ca2+ channel blockers (20Garcı́a J. Beam K.G. J. Gen. Physiol. 1994; 103: 107-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). It probably results from deleterious effects of Cd2+ and La3+, which cause an essentially irreversible increase in resting fluorescence (F). In agreement with previous results (3Tanabe T. Beam K.G. Adams B.A. Niidome T. Numa S. Nature. 1990; 346: 567-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar), skeletal-type EC coupling was observed in dysgenic myotubes expressing the chimera CSk3, in which the II-III loop of the cardiac DHPR was replaced with the corresponding skeletal sequence (Fig. 1). The presence of a PKA phosphorylation site did not appear to be critical, because S687A was able to mediate skeletal-type EC coupling (all 7 myotubes tested). Moreover, the magnitude and voltage dependence of the slow Ca2+ current for S687A (G'max = 54.4 ± 44.6 nanosiemens/nanofarads; V'½ = 27.6 ± 9.5 mV; k'= 7.9 ± 2.2 mV; n = 6) were similar to those of the slow Ca2+ current in dysgenic myotubes expressing CAC6 (19Garcı́a J. Tanabe T. Beam K.G. J. Gen. Physiol. 1994; 103: 125-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). To localize the region of the II-III loop most important for skeletal-type EC coupling, we constructed new chimeric DHPRs, using CSk3 as the parent structure. These chimeras had cardiac sequence except for a small amount of skeletal sequence within the II-III loop. Schematics of the II-III loops of the chimeras and representative Ca2+ transients observed after expression in dysgenic myotubes are illustrated in Fig. 2. The initial chimeras examined were CSk31 and CSk32, in which either the N- or C-terminal half, respectively, of the II-III loop of CSk3 was replaced with the corresponding cardiac sequence. CSk32, but not CSk31, produced a Ca2+ transient after block of the Ca2+ current by Cd2+ and La3+ (Fig. 2), indicating the importance of the C-terminal half of the II-III loop. Thus, we next examined CSk33 and CSk34, in which complementary regions of the skeletal portion of CSk32 were converted to cardiac sequence. CSk33 supported skeletal-type EC coupling, whereas CSk34 did not. Thus, the middle portion of the II-III loop, indicated by the vertical dashed lines in Fig. 2, is important for skeletal-type EC coupling. Successively larger segments of the N-terminal half of this region were converted to cardiac sequence in the constructs CSk53, CSk54, and CSk40 and of the C-terminal half in the constructs CSk56 and CSk39. Of the constructs with less skeletal sequence at the N-terminal half, CSk53 and CSk54 produced skeletal-type EC coupling, but CSk40 did not. Of the constructs with less skeletal sequence at the C-terminal half, CSk56 produced skeletal-type coupling but CSk39 did not. Because there appeared to be insufficient skeletal sequence in CSk39 or CSk40 to support skeletal-type coupling, it suggested that the region of overlap between the next two larger constructs mediating skeletal-type EC coupling (CSk54 and CSk56) might be essential. Thus, we made CSk58, which has skeletal muscle sequence corresponding to this overlap region (indicated by vertical dotted lines in Fig. 2 (skeletal residues 725–742)). CSk58 was able to mediate skeletal-type EC coupling, but the coupling was weak in that a detectable Ca2+ transient was present after block of Ca2+ current in only 3 of 12 cells expressing CSk58 compared with 8 of 8 cells expressing CSk33 (see legend to Fig. 2). In this study, we identified a small region (CSk58, skeletal residues 725–742) of the DHPR II-III loop that is critical for skeletal-type EC coupling. This region is located a little toward the C-terminal half from the middle of the II-III loop and includes 5 conservative and 7 non-conservative amino acid changes from the corresponding portion of the cardiac loop (Fig. 3). Chimeras that included only the N-terminal half (CSk39) or C-terminal half (CSk40) of the CSk58 region were unable to mediate skeletal-type EC coupling. Although an intact CSk58 region appeared to be necessary for skeletal-type EC coupling, this coupling was considerably weaker than that for chimeras containing additional skeletal residues on either side of the CSk58 region. Ser687 in the skeletal II-III loop, which is phosphorylated by PKA, is not included in the CSk58 region, and a purely skeletal DHPR with the mutation S687A retained the ability to mediate skeletal-type EC coupling (Fig. 1). The cardiac II-III loop contains an inserted segment of 12 amino acids (cardiac residues 831–842) corresponding to a site between skeletal residues 710 and 711 (Fig. 3). The presence of this insertion in CSk53, CSk54, and CSk58 did not prevent them from mediating skeletal-type EC coupling (Fig. 2). A simple way to account for our results would be to postulate that skeletal-type EC coupling involves a direct interaction between the RyR and the II-III loop of the DHPR, with loop residues 725–742 being especially important. For example, these amino acids might constitute an “agonist,” which assumes the right configuration to bind to (and activate) the RyR only when the sarcolemma is depolarized. Unfortunately, the experiments with chimeric DHPRs do not provide a direct test of this hypothesis. An approach that has been used by other investigators to probe interactions between DHPRs and RyRs is to create peptides corresponding to various parts of the DHPR sequence and then to test for effects on RyRs by applying the peptides either to triad/SR vesicular preparations (activation monitored as an increase in [3H]ryanodine binding or Ca2+ efflux) or to RyRs reconstituted in artificial planar bilayers (activation monitored by an increase in open probability). As discussed below, it is difficult to construct a consistent framework that can account for both the results of application of the constructed peptides and our results on expression of DHPR cDNAs in dysgenic myotubes. Lu et al. (11Lu X. Xu L. Meissner G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6511-6516Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) found that [3H]ryanodine binding to skeletal SR vesicles is increased by both a skeletal and a cardiac II-III loop peptide (SDCL and CDCL, respectively). This result seems difficult to reconcile with the observation that CSk3 (the chimera with a skeletal II-III loop) restores skeletal-type EC coupling whereas CARD1 (purely cardiac DHPR) does not (Fig. 1 (3Tanabe T. Beam K.G. Adams B.A. Niidome T. Numa S. Nature. 1990; 346: 567-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar, 4Tanabe T. Beam K.G. Powell J.A. Numa S.

(12Lu X. Xu L. Meissner G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18459-18464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) subsequently found that phosphorylated SDCL specifically binds to, but does not activate, the skeletal RyR and that mutation of Ser687 to alanine abolishes the ability of the SDCL to activate the skeletal RyR. This latter observation contrasts with our finding that both wild-type and S687A mutant skeletal DHPRs are able to mediate skeletal-type EC coupling (Fig. 1). More recently, Leong and MacLennan (13Leong P. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7791-7794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) found that a 37-amino acid segment of the skeletal RyR binds to the skeletal II-III loop and that this binding is mostly lost when Lys677 and Lys682 of the skeletal II-III loop are mutated to glutamates, the corresponding cardiac residues. This contrasts with our observation that the skeletalversus cardiac identity of this portion of the II-III loop had no effect on the ability to mediate skeletal-type EC coupling. To localize regions that might be critical for EC coupling, Lu et al. (12Lu X. Xu L. Meissner G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18459-18464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) divided the II-III loop into three smaller peptides, termed F1 (Glu666–Glu726), F2 (Pro709–Leu766), and F3 (Lys733–Leu791). The peptide F1, which represents only about the N-terminal half of the SDCL (Fig. 3), was found both to increase [3H]ryanodine binding to the skeletal RyR and to displace binding of the phosphorylated SDCL, whereas peptides F2 and F3 caused little or no increase in [3H]ryanodine binding and did not detectably displace the binding of the phosphorylated SDCL (12Lu X. Xu L. Meissner G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18459-18464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Using somewhat smaller peptides corresponding to four distinct regions, El-Hayek et al. (14El-Hayek R. Antoniu B. Wang J. Hamilton S.L. Ikemoto N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22116-22118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) also found that an N-terminal portion of the II-III loop causes activation of the RyR. Specifically, they found that “peptide A” (Thr671–Leu690; see Fig. 3) caused Ca2+ efflux from, and enhanced [3H]ryanodine binding to, triad-enriched microsomes of skeletal muscle. Peptides corresponding to portions of the II-III loop closer to the C-terminal half, including a “peptide C1” (Phe725–Gly743), which approximately overlaps the skeletal sequence of our CSk58 chimera (see Fig. 3), did not increase [3H]ryanodine binding or Ca2+efflux. Although not causing activation, “peptide C” (Glu724–Pro760), which roughly overlaps the skeletal sequence in our CSk53 chimera, moderately antagonized the actions of peptide A. Thus, it may be that two portions of the DHPR II-III loop (corresponding to peptides A and C) both bind to the skeletal RyR. However, there is also a discrepancy between the results of El-Hayek et al. (14El-Hayek R. Antoniu B. Wang J. Hamilton S.L. Ikemoto N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22116-22118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) and those of Lu et al.(12Lu X. Xu L. Meissner G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18459-18464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), who found that the peptide F2 (larger than and encompassing the peptide C region) failed to antagonize binding of the phosphorylated SDCL to the skeletal RyR (12Lu X. Xu L. Meissner G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18459-18464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). To account for the results of the peptide experiments, one could hypothesize that EC coupling involves activation of the RyR via the N-terminal half of the II-III loop. However, if this were the only important interaction between the DHPR and RyR it would be difficult to explain why the identity of this region (skeletal versuscardiac) had no influence on whether or not the II-III loop chimeras mediated skeletal-type EC coupling (Fig. 2). As a way of maintaining the hypothesis that the N-terminal half of the II-III loop is the physiological activator of the skeletal RyR, one might postulate that skeletal-type EC coupling depends upon an additional inhibitory interaction in resting muscle between the RyR and the portion of the II-III loop corresponding to peptide C. Because peptide C overlaps the region found in the loop chimeras to be critical for skeletal-type EC coupling, this hypothetical inhibitory interaction might be lost in chimeras having cardiac sequence in the region corresponding to peptide C. However, it has also been reported that a peptide corresponding to amino acids 1487–1506 of the skeletal DHPR inhibits [3H]ryanodine binding to skeletal and cardiac membranes and also activity of the reconstituted skeletal RyR (15Slavik K.J. Wang J.-P. Aghdasi B. Zhang J.-Z. Mandel F. Malouf N. Hamilton S.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: C1475-C1481Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This peptide corresponds to a region within the C terminus, which was shown not to affect whether chimeric DHPRs could mediate skeletal-type EC coupling (3Tanabe T. Beam K.G. Adams B.A. Niidome T. Numa S. Nature. 1990; 346: 567-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). Just as there are important limitations on experiments with chimeric DHPRs (i.e. the inability to test for direct interactions between the DHPR and RyR), there are also significant weaknesses in the experiments with isolated peptides. For example, the isolated peptides may assume conformations different from those of the corresponding regions of the DHPR in living cells. Equally or more important, the isolated peptides may act at sites on the RyR that are different from those actually involved in EC coupling. By expressing cDNAs encoding engineered RyRs in dyspedic myotubes in which the RyR-1 gene is disrupted (21Yamazawa T. Takeshima H. Sakurai T. Endo M. Iino M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6172-6177Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 22Nakai J. Sekiguchi N. Rando T.A. Allen P.D. Beam K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13403-13406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), it may be possible to identify regions of the RyR critical for skeletal-type EC coupling. In turn, this will make it possible to determine whether one or more of the isolated peptides acts at sites coincident with those identified by the expression of RyR cDNAs. Thus, progress in our understanding of EC coupling is likely to continue benefiting from analysis of DHPR/RyR interactions using both isolated proteins and expression of cDNAs in dysgenic and dyspedic myotubes.

Freshly isolated hepatocytes from old rats exhibited a significantly decreased ascorbic acid recycling capacity in response to oxidative stress (P<0.005) compared to cells from young rats. Ascorbic acid synthesis in these cells from old animals was unaffected by various concentrations of tert-butylhydroperoxide, but amounted to only approximately half of the biosynthetic rate when compared to cells from young animals (P<0.001). Cells from young animals were not significantly affected by the tert-butylhydroperoxide treatments. The results demonstrate a declining ability with age to respond to increased oxidative stress. (R)-alpha-Lipoic acid, a mitochondrial coenzyme, is a powerful antioxidant. A two-week dietary supplementation of old animals with 0.5% (R)-alpha-lipoic acid prior to cell isolation almost completely reversed the age-associated effects on ascorbic acid concentration (P<0.0001), recycling (P<0.05) and biosynthesis after oxidative stress. These results provide further evidence for the potential of alpha-lipoic acid in treatment of diseases related to oxidative stress.

In mast cells and T-lymphocytes, this store-operated calcium (SOC) current is highly selective for Ca2+ ions and has been termed calcium release-activated-calcium current (I CRAC) (4Hoth M. Penner R.

I CRAC has also been measured in the mast cell line RBL-2H3, in hepatocytes, in thyrocytes, 3T3 fibroblasts, and HL-60 cells (6Hoth M. Fasolato C. Penner R. Ann. N. Y. Acad.

A. 1995; 92: 7907-7911Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), although the exact mechanism for activation of I CRAC remains unknown. One of the difficulties in pin-pointing a definite mechanism for regulation of I CRAC may relate to the fact that PLC activation functions in parallel with other intracellular signaling processes. The sphingomyelin (SM) pathway, for example, “cross-talks” with the PLC pathway (9Spiegel S. Milstien S. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1996; 80: 27-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Activation of the SM pathway produces important second messengers such as sphingosine, sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), and ceramide (10Hannun Y.A. Science. 1996; 274: 1855-1859Crossref PubMed Scopus (1491) Google Scholar). Generally, sphingosine and S1P mediate cell growth and proliferation, whereas ceramide elevations cause programmed cell death (apoptosis) or cell cycle arrest (9Spiegel S. Milstien S. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1996; 80: 27-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Although several direct targets have been characterized for ceramide (10Hannun Y.A. Science. 1996; 274: 1855-1859Crossref PubMed Scopus (1491) Google Scholar), the picture is less clear for sphingosine. PKC has been shown to be a target for sphingosine (11Hannun Y.A. Loomis C.R. Merrill Jr., A.H. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 12604-12609Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but the action of sphingosine on other proteins and intracellular processes may be mediated by conversion to S1P and/or ceramide (10Hannun Y.A. Science. 1996; 274: 1855-1859Crossref PubMed Scopus (1491) Google Scholar, 12Spiegel S. Olivera A. Carlson R.O. Adv. Lipid Res. 1993; 25: 105-129PubMed Google Scholar,13Merrill Jr., A.H. Hannun Y.A.

Indeed, it has been demonstrated that elevations in [Ca2+]ican modulate cell growth (14Conklin B.R. Brann M.R. Buckley N.J. Ma A.L. Bonner T.I. Axelrod J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

We have therefore investigated the role of the SM pathway in regulating intracellular calcium concentration, focusing on the major Ca2+ influx pathway provided by the SOC currentI CRAC in the mast cell line RBL-2H3. We surveyed the sphingomyelin pathway for possible regulators of I CRAC and found that sphingosine and structurally related compounds (but not S1P nor ceramides) are inhibitors. None of the agents tested activateI CRAC. A requirement for inhibition of ICRAC is incorporation of the lipid molecule into the plasma membrane. Sphingolipid incorporation was measured as an elevation of the whole cell capacitance, which represents a new approach for monitoring lipid or possibly drug accumulation in the plasma membrane. To provide a link between cellular sphingosine and inhibition of I CRAC, we tested several growth factors, which are known to activate sphingomyelinase and/or to elevate sphingosine levels (9Spiegel S.

NGF-induced inhibition of ICRAC was reduced by treatment withl-cycloserine (LCS; 2 mm), which lowers SM levels (26Jacobs L.S. Kester M. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: C740-C747Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and hinders sphingosine production by NGF. Implications for sphingosine-dependent block of I CRACare discussed. Rat basophilic leukemia cells (RBL-2H3) were plated on glass coverslips at low density and incubated at 37 °C with 10% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 45 mm sodium bicarbonate, 5 mm glucose, 0.12 mg/ml streptomycin, and 0.60 mg/ml penicillin. For the recordings, coverslips were transferred into the recording chamber containing the desired external solution. RBL-2H3 cells stably transfected with m1 muscarinic receptors (RBL-m1 (28Jones S.V. Choi O.H. Beaven M.A. FEBS Lett. 1991; 289: 47-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 29Choi O.H. Lee J.H.

RBL-m1 cells were cultured identically to RBL-2H3 cells, except 400 μg/ml G418 was added to the RBL-m1 growth medium to select for transfected cells. The muscarinic receptor agonist carbamylcholine (CCh; 100 μm) activated calcium release (as measured by fura-2) or I CRAC (in patch-clamp experiments) in every RBL-m1 cell tested. The tight-seal whole cell configuration was used for patch-clamp. Experiments were conducted at room temperature (20–27 °C) in standard external saline solution containing the following (in mm): 140 NaCl, 2.8 KCl, 10 CaCl2, 2 MgCl2, 10 CsCl, 11 glucose, and 10 HEPES·NaOH (pH 7.2). Sylgard-coated, fire-polished patch pipettes had resistances between 1.5 and 3 megohms after filling with the standard internal solution which contained the following (in mm): 145 Cs·Glu, 8 NaCl, 1 MgCl2, 10 Cs·EGTA, 0.02 InsP3, and 10 mm HEPES·CsOH (pH 7.2). Whole cell break-in with this standard internal solution always led to activation of I CRAC. Whole cell break-in without activation of I CRACwas achieved by excluding InsP3, clamping intracellular Ca2+ to ∼80 nm with 2 to 1 ratio of Cs·EGTA/Ca·EGTA, and including nucleotides (4 mmMg·ATP and 300 μm Na2·GTP) to maintain intracellular integrity and to prevent depletion of internal Ca2+ stores. This internal solution was used when testing for activation of I CRAC by various sphingomyelin pathway intermediates. High resolution current recordings were acquired by a computer-based patch-clamp amplifier system (EPC-9). Currents due to cellular membrane capacitance were recorded and canceled before each voltage ramp using the automatic capacitance compensation of the EPC-9. In this manner, whole cell capacitance was measured throughout the experiment. Series resistance was between 2 and 10 megohms, and inhibition of I CRAC did not correlate with series resistance. Currents were filtered at 3.3 kHz and digitized at 100 μs. Currents elicited by voltage ramps in Fig. 1 were filtered at 1 kHz off-line. Ramps were given every 2 s (−100 to +100 mV in 50 ms) from a holding potential of 0 mV, and the Ca2+ current was analyzed at the ramp segment corresponding to −80 mV. This protocol minimized Ca2+ entry because of the delay between ramps and because of the relatively small driving force for Ca2+ at 0 mV. Minimizing Ca2+ entry is important to limit Ca2+-dependent inactivation of I CRAC by local accumulation of Ca2+(30Hoth M. Penner R. J. Physiol.

All currents were leak-subtracted by averaging the first two to six ramps after breaking in and then subtracting this from all subsequent traces. For display purposes, averaged time courses of I CRAC were graphed at slightly lower temporal resolution (i.e. 0.25–0.125 Hz). Extracellular solution changes were made by local pressure application from a wide-tipped micropipette placed within 20 μm of the cell. A liquid-junction potential of −10 mV was corrected. We have eliminated all experiments from our analysis in which nonspecific membrane breakdown by sphingosine occurred within the typical observation window of 5–10 min. During patch-clamp recordings, breakdown was characterized by sudden increases in linear ramp currents, and in fluorescence measurements, increases in [Ca2+] as well as dye leakage occurred. Such breakdown was seen in approximately 50% of the cells, both in patch-clamp and fluorescence experiments. Intracellular [Ca2+] was monitored with a photomultiplier-based system and calculated from the fluorescence ratio (360/390). For single cell Ca2+ measurements, coverslips were incubated in a Ringer's solution containing the following (in mm): 140 NaCl, 2.8 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 2 CaCl2, 11 glucose, and 10 Na·HEPES (pH 7.2), to which 5 μm fura-2/acetoxymethyl ester had been added. Following incubation at 37°C for 15–20 min the coverslips were washed five times in the Ringer's solution. Experiments were done at room temperature. Inward rectifier potassium currents were measured in RBL-2H3 cells. The external saline solution contained the following (in mm): 140 NaCl, 20 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 2 MgCl2, 11 glucose, and 10 HEPES·NaOH (pH 7.2). The internal saline solution contained the following (in mm): 145 K·Glu, 8 NaCl, 1 MgCl2, 2 Mg·ATP, 0.3 Na2·GTP, 10 K·EGTA, and 10 HEPES·KOH (pH 7.2). Ramps were given every 2 s (−100 to +100 mV in 50 ms), and cells were held at 0 mV between ramps. Currents were not leak-subtracted. Under these conditions, the K+current (measured at −80 mV) did not run down, but in fact the amplitude steadily increased in control experiments over a period of approximately 200 s. Delayed rectifier potassium currents were measured in rat skeletal myoballs isolated from newborn rats (2–5 days old) as described (32Fleig A. Penner R. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1995; 489: 41-53Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The external solution contained the following (in mm): 140 NaCl, 2.8 KCl, 1 CaCl2, 2 MgCl2, 0.5 CdCl2, 0.03 TTX, 11 glucose, and 10 HEPES·NaOH (pH 7.2). The internal solution contained the following (in mm): 140 K·Glu, 8 NaCl, 1 MgCl2, 2 Mg·ATP, 0.3 Na2·GTP, 20 K·EGTA, and 10 HEPES·KOH (pH 7.2). Voltage pulses to +60 mV were applied every 20 s from a holding potential of −70 mV. N-type Ca2+ channel currents were measured in bovine adrenal chromaffin cells isolated as described previously (33Fenwick E.M. Marty A. Neher E. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1982; 331: 577-597Crossref Scopus (579) Google Scholar). The external solution contained the following (in mm): 135 NaCl, 2.8 KCl, 2 MgCl2, 10 CaCl2, 10 TEA·Cl, 0.03 TTX, and 10 HEPES·NaOH (pH 7.4). The internal solution contained (in mm): 140 Cs·Glu, 8 NaCl, 1 MgCl2, 10 Cs·EGTA, 4 Mg·ATP, 0.3 Na2·GTP, and 10 HEPES·CsOH (pH 7.4). Voltage pulses to +10 mV were applied every 2 s from a holding potential of −70 mV. L-type Ca2+ channel currents were measured in rat skeletal myoballs. The external solution contained the following (in mm): 140 NaCl, 2.8 KCl, 2 MgCl2, 10 CaCl2, 10 TEA·CL, 0.03 TTX, and 10 HEPES·NaOH (pH 7.2). The internal solution contained the following (in mm): 145N-methyl-d-glucamine, 8 NaCl, 1 MgCl2, 20 Cs·EGTA, 4 Mg·ATP, 0.3 Na2·GTP, and 10 HEPES·CsOH (pH 7.2). Voltage pulses to 0 mV were applied every 20 s from a holding potential of −70 mV. Na+ currents were measured in bovine adrenal chromaffin cells. The external solution contained the following (in mm): 135 NaCl, 2.8 KCl, 2 MgCl2, 2 CaCl2, 1 CdCl2, 10 TEA·Cl, and 10 HEPES·NaOH (pH 7.4).

Voltage pulses to +10 mV were applied every 2 s from a holding potential of −70 mV. Currents were filtered at 8 kHz and sampled at 25 μs. Current records obtained from all experiments in which voltage-activated currents were studied were leak-subtracted by a standard P/n procedure, where 4 leak pulses of −0.1× the actual test pulse amplitude were averaged, scaled, and subtracted from the current evoked by the test pulse. Palmitoyl-co-enzyme A, sphingomyelinase (Staphylococcus aureus), sphingosylphosphorylcholine (lysosphingomyelin), and Long R3 insulin growth factor were purchased from Sigma. N-Acetylsphingosine (C2-ceramide), N-octanoylsphingosine (C8-ceramide), N-octanoylsphingosine 1-phosphate (ceramide 1-phosphate), sphingosine 1-phosphate, phospholipase A2 (Trimeresurus flavoviridis), phospholipase D (Streptomyces chromofuscus), sphinganine (d-erythro-dihydrosphingosine), sphingomyelin, stem cell factor, platelet-derived growth factor, NGF 2.5S (murine), and tumor necrosis factor-α were from Calbiochem. Sphingosine (d-erythro-sphingosine),N, N-dimethylsphingosine,dl-threo-dihydrosphingosine,l-cycloserine, and fumonisin B1 were from Biomol. All other chemicals were from Sigma. Sphingosine and palmitoyl coenzyme A were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) at 10 mm.dl-threo-Dihydrosphingosine, sphingosylphosphorylcholine, sphingosine 1-phosphate, and sphingomyelin were dissolved in methanol at 10 mm. C2-ceramide, C8-ceramide, and ceramide 1-phosphate were dissolved in either Me2SO or methanol at 10 mm. In most experiments, the vehicles Me2SO or methanol were diluted in external saline by a ratio of 1:1000 and neither vehicles significantly altered membrane currents when applied alone (up to 0.5%). Sphingomyelinase, LCS, and phospholipase A2 were dissolved directly in external saline. Phospholipase D was dissolved in special buffer containing 10 mm Tris·HCl (pH 8.0), 0.05% bovine serum albumin, and 0.1% Triton X-100 to a concentration of 500 units/ml (pH 8.0) and was further diluted in external solution by a factor of 1:1000. Growth factors, including NGF, were dissolved in external saline containing 0.1% essentially fatty acid-free BSA (Sigma). The external solution used for experiments with sphingomyelinase and palmitoyl coenzyme A contained 2 mm Ca2+ (instead of the usual 10 mm) to increase the solubility of these molecules. In RBL cells, InsP3 indirectly activatesI CRAC by depleting internal Ca2+stores. Fig. 1 A shows the time course of I CRAC following whole cell break-in with 20 μm InsP3 in the pipette solution (left panel). Voltage ramps (−100 to +100 mV in 50 ms;right panel) were applied every 2 s, and I CRAC was measured from the region on the ramp trace corresponding to −80 mV. Averaged values from 22 cells are shown (left panel). The Ca2+ current activates and peaks in approximately 50 s. Then I CRAC is sustained, decaying only 9.1 ± 2.5% (mean ± S.E.;n = 21) 300 s after break-in. The experiments were done without ATP in the pipette solution to minimize endogenous kinase-dependent inactivation of I CRAC (8Parekh A.B. Penner R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7907-7911Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Externally applied sphingosine (5 μm) blocks InsP3-evoked I CRAC (Fig. 1 B). Sphingosine was applied 50 s after whole cell break-in, and the onset of block follows a delay of 18 ± 3 s (n = 6). The delay probably relates to the time taken for sphingosine to accumulate in the plasma membrane (see “Elevation of Membrane Capacitance,” below). Complete inhibition of the current occurs within 200 s after addition of sphingosine, and the effect is not reversible within measurement time (5–10 min). Sphingosine also inhibits activation of I CRAC when applied at least 1 min before break-in with InsP3 (n = 2, not shown). Furthermore, sphingosine was also able to suppressI CRAC when activated by thapsigargin, which represents an alternative pool-emptying protocol (Fig. 1 C). Sphingosine when co-applied with thapsigargin essentially abolished thapsigargin-induced I CRAC (n = 3), whereas control cells that were only stimulated with thapsigargin consistently activated regular-sized I CRAC after a delay of about 60 s (n = 3). In these experiments, cells were perfused with the standard internal solution (buffered to resting [Ca2+]i and without InsP3), and either thapsigargin alone (1 μm) or in combination with sphingosine (5 μm) were applied externally. This block of I CRAC by sphingosine seems to be PKC-independent for the following reasons: 1) the PKC inhibitor staurosporine (5 μm; co-applied externally) has no effect on sphingosine block of I CRAC (n= 3, not shown), and 2) exogenous sphingosine inhibits PKC (11Hannun Y.A. Loomis C.R. Merrill Jr., A.H. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 12604-12609Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because PKC inhibitors sustain I CRAC (8Parekh A.B. Penner R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7907-7911Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), an explanation dependent on PKC inhibition by sphingosine would be opposite to the blocking effect illustrated in Fig. 1 B. Another possible explanation for inhibition might be that sphingosine maximally activates I CRAC, in a manner similar to ionomycin (4Hoth M. Penner R. Nature. 1992; 355: 353-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (1486) Google Scholar). Maximal activation could, in principle, cause intracellular Ca2+ accumulation during long applications and subsequent inhibition of I CRAC channels by calcium-dependent inactivation (30Hoth M. Penner R. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1993; 465: 359-386Crossref Scopus (658) Google Scholar, 31Zweifach A. Lewis R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14445-14451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). This possibility was ruled out by the following experiment: whole cell break-in without activation of I CRAC was achieved by excluding InsP3 from the pipette solution, including ATP, and buffering internal Ca2+ to ∼80 nm. With these conditions, applying sphingosine 50 s after break-in never activated I CRAC (n = 6, not shown), indicating that sphingosine block is not mediated by “over activation.” It could still be possible, however, that sphingosine interacts with the [Ca2+]i inactivation site of CRAC channels thereby mimicking Ca2+-induced inactivation of I CRAC. Interestingly, sphingosine fails to inhibitI CRAC when applied from the inside (Fig. 1 D). Whole cell break-in was conducted with or without sphingosine in the pipette solution (omitting InsP3 and including 10 mm EGTA), and a short application of ionomycin (2 μm) was used to activate I CRAC. The time course of I CRAC in control cells (n = 3) versus the time course in cells dialyzed internally with 10 μm sphingosine (n = 4) is similar (Fig. 1 D). Block of I CRAC by external sphingosine is dose-dependent (Fig. 2). Concentrations between 10 and 30 μm block ∼100% of the Ca2+ current within 100 s. Lower concentrations inhibit more slowly. For example, 1 μm sphingosine blocks approximately 70% of I CRAC in 400 s. Average I CRAC time courses during application of 300 nm (n = 5), 1 μm(n = 5), and 10 μm (n = 4) sphingosine are plotted in Fig. 2 A. The averageI CRAC time course during treatment with 300 nm sphingosine is indistinguishable from the control (cf. Fig. 1 A). The large variability observed at 1 μm is due to variations of endogenous decay of I CRAC. Concentrations of sphingosine between 100 nm and 30 μm were tested, and a dose-response curve was constructed by measuring the percentage of inhibition at 50 s after application (Fig. 2 B). The corresponding apparent half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) for sphingosine is at 6 μm. Because full block occurs at lower concentrations, but over a much longer time, we also constructed a dose-response curve using the time course of decay as the dependent variable (Fig. 2 C). To measure the blocking time, single exponentials were fit to theI CRAC time course during inhibition by sphingosine. The time constants of inhibition ranged from 24 ± 4 s with 30 μm sphingosine (n = 3) to 1,529 ± 400 s with 100 nm sphingosine (n = 4). The apparent IC50 using this method is at 1 μm. To determine whether sphingosine blocks I CRACactivated by agonist, we used muscarinic type 1 receptors stably transfected in RBL-2H3 cells (RBL-m1). Muscarinic receptor activation with carbamylcholine (CCh) elevates InsP3 levels which release Ca2+ from internal stores (Fig. 3 B (28Jones S.V. Choi O.H. Beaven M.A. FEBS Lett. 1991; 289: 47-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 29Choi O.H. Lee J.H. Kassessinoff T. Cunha-Melo J.R. Jones S.V. Beaven M.A. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 5586-5595PubMed Google Scholar)). Following store depletion, I CRAC activates and provides a pathway for Ca2+ entry. In whole cell recordings, CCh (100 μm) activated ICRAC in 9 of 9 cells tested (Fig. 3 A). Co-application of sphingosine (5 μm) and CCh decreased the amplitude of ICRACby greater than 50%, and the current decayed to base line with a time constant of 105 ± 53 s (n = 5). This rate of inhibition is similar to the rate measured for sphingosine-mediated block of InsP3-evoked I CRAC at the same concentration (76 ± 20 s; n = 6). Therefore, sphingosine can block I CRAC activated by a physiologically relevant stimulus. These results were confirmed by measuring intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) changes in single RBL-m1 cells loaded with fura-2/acetoxymethyl ester. Fig. 3 B shows averaged muscarinic receptor-mediated Ca2+ signals in the presence of 10 mm extracellular Ca2+ (control), 0 Ca2+, or 10 mm Ca2+ + 5 μm sphingosine. In the control cells, CCh elevates Ca2+ levels to 1.3 ± 0.1 μm(n = 17) following a short delay. The [Ca2+]i remained elevated for longer than 100 s before declining slightly. I CRACcontributes to this sustained elevation of Ca2+. Following removal of CCh the [Ca2+]i returns toward base line (not shown). The Ca2+ dependence of the sustained phase is demonstrated by similar experiments in nominally Ca2+-free external saline where the [Ca2+]i returns quickly toward base-line values following the peak elevation (1.3 ± 0.1 μm;n = 5). When sphingosine was co-applied with CCh, the sustained phase was dramatically reduced (n = 5). Clearly, the time course of sphingosine inhibition is similar to the time course of I CRAC block shown in Fig. 3 A. Assessment of the mechanism by which sphingosine blocksI CRAC depends on whether this sphingolipid alters calcium homeostasis; however, the reported effects of sphingosine on intracellular calcium homeostasis are highly variable. In some preparations, sphingosine elevates intracellular InsP3 (34Chao C.P. Laulederkind S.J. Ballou L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5849-5856Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Sugiya H.

In other cell types, exogenous sphingosine has no effect on resting Ca2+ levels (21Breittmayer J.P. Bernard A. Aussel C. J. Biol.

In 15 of 21 cells tested, sphingosine (5 μm) by itself elevated Ca2+ levels following a delay of 81 ± 11 s (data not shown). In nominally Ca2+-free external solution, sphingosine elevated Ca2+ levels in 8 of 16 cells after a delay of 49 ± 10 s. However, including 0.1% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin (BSA) to the perfusion solution along with sphingosine prevented [Ca2+]i changes in Ca2+-containing (n = 7) and Ca2+-free (n = 8) solutions. BSA had no effect on sphingosine-mediated block of I CRAC(n = 2). When co-applied with sphingosine, BSA prevents cell permeabilization and subsequent dye leakage (37Pittet D. Krause K.H.

https://openalex.org/W1581664394,"Proinflammatory agents were assessed for their capacity to stimulate the expression of the inducible cyclooxygenase isoform (COX-2) in human neutrophils. A number of agents, including PMA, opsonized bacteria and zymosan, LPS, GM-CSF, TNF-α, and fMLP, induced COX-2 protein expression through signaling pathways involving transcription and protein synthesis events. Northern blots showed that freshly isolated neutrophils expressed low levels of COX-2 mRNA, which rapidly increased after incubation with inflammatory agents. A characterization of the signal transduction pathways leading to COX-2 protein expression was initiated. In LPS-treated neutrophils, efficient induction of COX-2 required the presence of serum and involved ligand binding to the CD14 surface antigen. The specific inhibitor of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK), SB 203580, had little effect on the induction of COX-2 expression in neutrophils, in contrast to what had been previously observed with other inflammatory cell types. Depending on the agonist present, ethanol differentially blocked the stimulated expression of COX-2, raising the possibility that phospholipase D activation might take part in the process of COX-2 induction. Major COX-2-derived prostanoids synthesized by inflammatory neutrophils were identified by liquid-chromatography and tandem mass-spectrometry as TXA2 and PGE2. The agonist-induced synthesis of TXA2 and PGE2 was effectively blocked by cycloheximide and by the specific COX-2 inhibitor NS-398. These results show that COX-2 can be induced in an active state by different classes of inflammatory mediators in the neutrophil. They support the concept that, in these cells, the COX-2 isoform is preeminent over COX-1 for the stimulated-production of prostanoids, and also suggest that neutrophil COX-2 displays a distinct profile of expression among circulatory cells.—Pouliot, M., Gilbert, C., Borgeat, P., Poubelle, P.

https://openalex.org/W1607676331,"CTGF is a 38 kDa cysteine-rich peptide whose synthesis and secretion are selectively induced by transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) in connective tissue cells. We have investigated the signaling pathways controlling the TGF-β induction of connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) gene expression. Our studies indicate that inhibitors of tyrosine kinases and protein kinase C do not block the signaling pathway used by TGF-β to induce CTGF gene expression. In contrast, elevation of cAMP levels within the target cells by a variety of methods blocked the induction of CTGF by TGF-β. Furthermore, agents that elevate cAMP blocked the induction of anchorage-independent growth (AIG) by TGF-β. Inhibition of AIG could be overcome by the addition of CTGF, indicating that it was not a general inhibition of growth but a selective inhibition of CTGF synthesis that is responsible for the inhibition of TGF-β-induced AIG by cAMP. Kinetic studies of the induction of DNA synthesis by CTGF in cells arrested by cAMP indicate that the block occurs in very late G1. These and other studies in monolayer cultures suggest that the CTGF restriction point in the cell cycle is distinct from the adhesion-dependent arrest point.—Kothapalli, D., Hayashi, N., Grotendorst, G.

The present study investigated the effect of sustained hyperglycemia in vitro on the glucose transport system of these cells. Trophoblasts isolated from term placentas and immunopurified were cultured for 24, 48, and 96 h in DMEM containing either 5.5 (normoglycemia) or 25 mmol/l D-glucose (hyperglycemia), respectively. Initial uptake of glucose was measured using 3-O-[14C]methyl-D-glucose. Kinetic parameters were calculated as K(M) = 73 mmol/l and Vmax = 29 fmol s(-1) per trophoblast cell. Uptake rates of cells cultured under hyperglycemic conditions did not differ at exogenous D-glucose concentrations in the physiological range (1, 5.5, 10, and 15 mmol/l), but were significantly decreased by 25% (P<0.05) at diabetes-like concentrations (20 and 25 mmol/l) as compared to normoglycemic conditions. This effect was due to a decrease in Vmax (-50%), whereas K(M) remained virtually unaffected. GLUT1 mRNA levels were lower by 50% (P<0.05; Northern blotting) and GLUT1 protein was reduced by 16% (P<0.05; Western blotting) in trophoblast cells cultured under hyperglycemic vs. normoglycemic conditions. We conclude that prolonged hyperglycemia in vitro reduces trophoblast glucose uptake at substrate concentrations corresponding to blood levels of poorly controlled diabetic gravidas. This effect is due to diminished GLUT1 mRNA and protein expression in the trophoblast."

Microbiol. 1987; 147: 231-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) (6Müller M. Müller H. Holzer H. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 723-727Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the case of FBPase, a rapid reversible phosphorylation is involved in the loss of enzymatic activity and followed by a proteolytic breakdown of the enzyme (1Funayama T. Gancedo J.M. Gancedo C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 109: 61-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 7Müller D. Holzer H. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Phosphorylation of FBPase was reported to shift the pH optimum of its activity from a neutral to a more alkaline pH (9Pohlig G. Holzer H. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 13818-13823Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Also, the sensitivity of the enzyme to inhibition by the allosteric effectors AMP and fructose-2,6-bisphosphate is changed, but no effect on affinity of the enzyme to the substrate fructose-1,6-bisphosphate or the divalent metal activator Mg2+ could be measured (10Marcus F. Rittenhouse J. Moberly L. Edelstein I. Hiller E. Rogers D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6058-6062Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of FBPase occurs at a serine residue in position 11 (11Rittenhouse J. Harrsch P.B. Kim J.N. Marcus F. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 3939-3943Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Rittenhouse J. Moberly L. Marcus F. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10114-10119Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This modification was proposed to target the protein to the proteolytic machinery for degradation (7Müller D. Holzer H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1981; 103: 926-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 8Mazon M.J. Gancedo J.M. Gancedo C. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 1128-1130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, site-directed mutagenesis of the serine to an alanine residue, by this preventing phosphorylation, showed no effect and disproved its importance for inactivation (13Rose M. Entian K.D. Hofmann L. Vogel R.F. Mecke D. FEBS Lett. 1988; 241: 55-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Degradation of FBPase due to selective uptake into the vacuole and subsequent hydrolysis dependent on the vacuolar proteinase yscA has been reported (14Chiang H.L. Schekman R. Nature. 1991; 350: 313-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Other studies, however, identified the cytosolic proteasome as the main proteolytic system involved in catabolite inactivation of FBPase (15Schork S.M. Bee G. Thumm M. Wolf D.H. FEBS Lett. 1994; 349: 270-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 16Schork S.M. Bee G. Thumm M. Wolf D.H. Nature. 1994; 369: 283-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Ubiquitin conjugation was found to be an essential prerequisite for FBPase degradation (2Schork S.M. Thumm M. Wolf D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26446-26450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), supporting degradation of the enzyme via the cytosolic proteasome. So far, the signals (degrons) determining FBPase for selective degradation after addition of glucose have not been identified in detail. However, glycolytic block mutants indicated that hexose phosphorylation was sufficient to trigger the proteolytic degradation (17Entian K.D. Droll L. Mecke D. Arch. Microbiol. 1983; 134: 187-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). 2K. Köhn and K. D. Entian, unpublished data.2K. Köhn and K. D. Entian, unpublished data. Using FBPase-β-galactosidase fusion proteins, the presence of instability determinants in at least two regions of FBPase could be shown (18Gamo F.J. Navas M.A. Blazquez M.A. Gancedo C. Gancedo J.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 879-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Determination of galactosidase activities of ICL-β-galactosidase fusion proteins indicated the importance of a decapeptide sequence, located between amino acid residues 37 and 46 of ICL, for glucose-induced degradation of the enzyme (19Ordiz I. Herrero P. Rodicio R. Moreno F. FEBS Lett. 1995; 367: 219-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). This decapeptide is not present in FBPase and other gluconeogenic enzymes. Here, we describe the isolation of gid mutant cells, which are defective in glucose-induceddegradation of FBPase. Characterization of these mutant strains suggests that they are also impaired in the breakdown of short lived N-end rule proteins (20Bachmair A. Finley D. Varshavsky A. Science. 1986; 234: 179-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (1366) Google Scholar), which are degraded via the ubiquitin-proteasome system (21Richter-Ruoff B. Heinemeyer W. Wolf D.H. FEBS Lett. 1992; 302: 192-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). We therefore reasoned the involvement of a specific signal sequence at the amino terminus of FBPase necessary for degradation. A sequence alignment of gluconeogenic enzymes, which are subject to catabolite inactivation, like cMDH and ICL, pointed to an amino-terminal proline residue that might be important for the degradation process. Site-directed mutagenesis of this proline residue yielded enzymatically active FBPase species, which are no more recognized by the catabolite inactivation machinery. Phosphorylation of FBPase is not a prerequisite for degradation. Yeast strains used in this work are listed in Table I. Cells were grown in mineral medium (MV), 0.67% Difco yeast nitrogen base without amino acids containing 2% glucose or, for derepression of FBPase, 2% ethanol or 2% acetate as the sole carbon source, and required supplements. Radiolabeling for pulse-chase experiments was done in pulse medium (0.17% Difco yeast nitrogen base without amino acids and ammonium sulfate, 0.5% proline, 100 μm ammonium sulfate, 2% ethanol, and required supplements). Radiolabeling for phosphorylation experiments was done in phosphorylation medium (phosphate-free MV). In all experiments requiring induction of plasmid-encoded synthesis of ubiquitin, CuSO4 was added to a final concentration of 100 μm.Table IYeast strainsStrainRelevant genotypeReferenceWAY.5–4AMATa his3-Δ1 ura3–52K.-D.

The FBP1-P1W and FBP1-P1S was obtained byHindIII, XbaI cleavage of pKD10W and pKD10S, respectively. The electrophoretically purified fragments were used to transform the yeast strain W303-1BKO. Transformants with an ethanol+ and Leu− phenotype were selected, and the correct integration of the respective gene was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction using primers flanking the insertion sites. The FBPase-β-galactosidase fusion containing plasmid pMZ1 derived from a DNA fragment coding for the first 291 amino acids of the FBPase and YEp357R (22Myers A.M. Tzagoloff A. Kinney D.M. Lusty C.J. Gene (Amst.). 1986; 45: 299-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar, 23Zweimüller, M.

Entian K.D. Hofmann L. Vogel R.F. Mecke D. FEBS Lett. 1988; 241: 55-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). YEp112 is a 2-μm-based S. cerevisiae-Escherichia coli shuttle vector that encodes a synthetic version of yeast ubiquitin (Ub) carrying an epitope from the hemagglutinin (ha) of influenza virus attached to the amino terminus of ubiquitin (haUb) under the control of the copper-inducible CUP1 promotor. The plasmids used for expression of ha-tagged ubiquitin were a gift from M. Hochstrasser (24Hochstrasser M. Ellison M.J. Chau V. Varshavsky A. Proc. Natl. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4606-4610Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). For standard techniques of recombinant DNA, established protocols were followed (25Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Plasmid pKD10 was constructed by inserting a XbaI fragment containing theFBP1 gene into plasmid pRS426 (26Christianson T.W. Sikorski R.S. Dante M. Shero J.H. Hieter P. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 110: 119-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (1429) Google Scholar). Using pKD10 and the two oligonucleotides (5′-ACC ACA CAT ATG AGT ACT CTA GTT AAC GGA CCA AGA AG-3′ for Pro1 → Ser; ACC ACA CAT ATG TGG ACT CTA GTT AAC GGA CCA AGA AG-3′ for Pro1 → Trp), we followed the well established procedure of Kunkel et al. (27Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4557) Google Scholar) to isolate the mutated FBPase species (plasmids pKD10S and pKD10W). For generating mutants with a defect in catabolite inactivation, the ethylmethane sulfonate mutagenesis procedure was followed (28Fink G.R. Methods Enzymol. 1970; 17: 59-78Crossref Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Protein extracts from yeast cells were prepared as described by Ciriacy (29Ciriacy M. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1975; 138: 157-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). FBPase (30Gancedo J.M. Gancedo C. Arch. Microbiol. 1971; 76: 132-138Google Scholar), ICL (31Dixon G.H. Kornberg H.L. Biochem.

Biochem. 1976; 74: 576-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), and β-galactosidase (34Chaudhuri B. Hämmerle M. Fürst P. FEBS Lett. 1995; 357: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) were measured as described. The protein concentration was determined using the microbiuret method (35Zamenhoff S. Methods Enzymol. 1957; 3: 696-704Crossref Scopus (311) Google Scholar). β-Galactosidase tests for mutant screen were as follows. Transformants containing the FBPase-β-galactosidase fusion protein were cultivated in 96-well microtiter plates. The wells were filled with 150 μl of synthetic complete medium with 2% glucose lacking uracil. Inoculation was done by transferring mutants with toothpicks. After 48 h of incubation at 28 °C under high humidity, the microtiter plates were centrifuged (2,000 × g, 5 min, room temperature). The medium was exchanged by a similar medium containing 2% glycerol and 2% ethanol instead of glucose. The cells were suspended again and incubated for another 4 days at 28 °C. The cultures were split to two equal aliquots by using a multichannel pipettor. One half was directly washed and frozen. After addition of glucose to a final concentration of 2%, the other half was incubated further for 100 min. The plates were centrifuged, washed twice with 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer (pH 6.5), and frozen at −20 °C. Crude extracts were prepared in the microtiter plates by addition of 25 μl of Zymolyase 20T solution (Seikagaku, 0.5 mg/ml) to the thawed cell sediment in each well. After 30 min of incubation at 30 °C, the crude extract was used directly for determining β-galactosidase activity (36Guarente L. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 181-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (871) Google Scholar). The developed yellow dye was measured in a microtiter plate reader. Proteasome activities were measured in crude extracts, prepared in small scale according to Heinemeyer et al. (37Heinemeyer W. Kleinschmidt J.A. Saidowsky J. Escher C. Wolf D.H. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 555-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). The three enzymatic activities of the proteasome were assayed as described by Fischer et al. (38Fischer M. Hilt W. Richter-Ruoff B. Gonen H. Ciechanover A. Wolf D.H. FEBS Lett. 1994; 355: 69-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Pulse-chase experiments were done according to Schork et al. (2Schork S.M. Thumm M. Wolf D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26446-26450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), using specific antibodies against FBPase. Protein bands were quantitated using a PhosphoImager storm (Molecular Dynamics). Immunodetection of FBPase-ha-ubiquitin conjugates was done as described by Schork et al. (2Schork S.M. Thumm M. Wolf D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26446-26450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Yeast strains were cultivated in MV medium containing 2% glucose and required supplements until an absorbance (A 600) of 6–7 was reached. After harvesting cells by centrifugation (for 5 min at 5000 × g) and washing, cells were preincubated for 4 h in MV medium containing 2% ethanol at an A 600 of 5. Cells were harvested by centrifugation (5 min at 5000 × g), washed with phosphorylation medium, and resuspended in phosphorylation medium at A 600 of 5. Radiolabeling was done by adding [32P]orthophosphate (Amersham, Braunschweig) to the cell suspension to a final concentration of 125 μCi per ml. After 30 min, a 1-ml sample was taken before glucose addition. Glucose was added to a final concentration of 2%, and a 1-ml sample was taken after 10 min of inactivation. Cell lysis and immunoprecipitation with specific FBPase antibodies was performed as described by Schorket al. (2Schork S.M. Thumm M. Wolf D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26446-26450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). To achieve a better understanding of the molecular mechanism of catabolite inactivation of FBPase, we generated mutants by ethylmethane sulfonate mutagenesis defective in the degradation of the enzyme. A fusion protein consisting of the amino-terminal part (291AA) of FBPase linked to β-galactosidase was used to identify these mutants. Wild-type strain WAY.5-4A was transformed with the plasmid-encoded FBPase-β-galactosidase fusion construct. Growth of the transformed strain on media containing ethanol or acetate as carbon source resulted in expression of the fusion protein. β-Galactosidase activity dropped to approximately 20 percent of the initial activity 100 min after addition of glucose to the growth medium. The transformants were mutagenized with ethylmethane sulfonate (70% survival rate), and after mutation, colonies were transferred into microtiter plates. The cultures were grown in microtiter plates under derepression conditions with glycerol and ethanol as carbon sources and thereafter divided in two halves. One half was immediately washed and stored at −20 °C as the control, whereas the second half was incubated with 2% glucose for 100 min. The β-galactosidase activities in both samples were measured and compared (for details, see “Experimental Procedures”). Screening of 29,000 mutagenized clones led to the isolation of seven mutant strains that carried high β-galactosidase activity even after glucose addition. After abortion of the plasmid carrying the FBPase-β-galactosidase hybrid, five of the mutants were stable and still defective in the inactivation of FBPase. All five mutants were recessive and segregated 2:2 in tetrad analysis. They fell into three complementation groups (gid1 to gid3 forglucose-induced degradation deficient). Three alleles were found for gid1 (gid1–1 to gid1–3), whereas only one allele was found for gid2 and gid3. The gid mutants were tested for growth phenotypes on synthetic complete media with different carbon sources such as glucose, raffinose, saccharose, maltose, galactose, ethanol, glycerol, and acetate. However, no obvious growth phenotype could be detected under these conditions. To characterize the mutant strains obtained, inactivation kinetics of FBPase and other gluconeogenic enzymes were followed (see “Experimental Procedures”). Within 150 min after glucose addition, the three gid mutants showed only a minor decrease of FBPase activity, which was the result of FBPase phosphorylation (Fig. 1 A). Catabolite inactivation in S. cerevisiae has also been described for PEPCK (39Haarasilta S. Oura E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1975; 52: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), cMDH (40Witt I. Kronau R. Holzer H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1966; 128: 63-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), and ICL (41Duntze W. Neumann D. Holzer H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1968; 3: 326-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). To test if thegid mutants were generally affected in catabolite inactivation, we followed the inactivation kinetics of these enzymes in addition to FBPase. All three mutants also revealed, besides a defect in the inactivation of FBPase, an impaired inactivation of PEPCK, cMDH, and ICL (Fig. 1 A). Three MDH isoenzymes are expressed in S. cerevisiae, but only the cMDH is a target of catabolite inactivation. Therefore, MDH activity in wild-type cells even 150 min after glucose addition does not decrease beyond 40% of the initial activity (Fig. 1 A) (40Witt I. Kronau R. Holzer H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1966; 128: 63-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). To confirm that the defective inactivation of FBPase found in gid mutants is due to defective degradation, we examined the mutants in a pulse-chase experiment. Wild-type and gid mutant strains were radiolabeled with [35S]methionine, derepressed for FBPase on ethanol-containing medium, and transferred onto glucose medium to induce FBPase degradation. Samples were taken at different time points, cells were lysed, and radiolabeled FBPase was immunoprecipitated using specific antibodies, separated on SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography. After 1 h on glucose, FBPase protein is almost completely degraded in wild-type cells, whereas in gidmutant strains FBPase is visible even after 2 h (Fig. 1 B). Mutants defective in proteolytic activities of the yeast proteasome had revealed the involvement of this protease complex in glucose-induced degradation of FBPase (15Schork S.M. Bee G. Thumm M. Wolf D.H. FEBS Lett. 1994; 349: 270-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 16Schork S.M. Bee G. Thumm M. Wolf D.H. Nature. 1994; 369: 283-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), indicating that this process is a cytoplasmic event. To check if defective degradation in the gid mutant cells is due to impaired proteolytic activity of the 20 S proteasome, crude extracts of stationary phase-growngid cells were assayed using three different peptide substrates to trace the three active sites of the enzyme complex (42Heinemeyer W. Fischer M. Krimmer T. Stachon U. Wolf D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25200-25209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). No significant decrease in the respective activities of the 20 S proteasome compared with the isogenic wild-type were found (Fig. 2). Degradation of FBPase occurs via the ubiquitin pathway (2Schork S.M. Thumm M. Wolf D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26446-26450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). To elucidate a possible involvement of the mutated gidproteins in the ubiquitin pathway, we measured the steady-state levels of short-lived N-end rule substrates, known to be degraded via the ubiquitin proteasome pathway, in the gid strains. We used three different ubiquitin-β-galactosidase fusion proteins: Pro-β-gal, Leu-β-gal, and Arg-β-gal (20Bachmair A. Finley D. Varshavsky A. Science. 1986; 234: 179-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (1366) Google Scholar). In contrast to all other ubiquitin-β-galactosidase fusion proteins, Pro-β-gal is slowly deubiquitinated. Although the fusion protein is cleaved with a short half-life, deubiquitinated Pro-β-gal is rather stable (20Bachmair A. Finley D. Varshavsky A. Science. 1986; 234: 179-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (1366) Google Scholar). The steady-state level of the Ub-Pro-β-gal fusion is increased 2-fold only in gid3–1 cells (Table II). Galactosidase activity of cells expressing Leu-β-gal in gid mutant cells is similar to the value found in proteasome mutant cells, about 10-fold higher as compared with isogenic wild-type cells. The highest increase of galactosidase activity was observed in cells expressing the very short-lived Arg-β-gal fusion. Steady-state levels of Arg-β-gal was increased 27-fold in gid1–1, 48-fold in gid2–1, and 21-fold in gid3–1 mutant cells, respectively. For comparison, a 13.6-fold increase of this activity was observed in proteasomal pre1–1 pre2–1 double mutant cells (21Richter-Ruoff B. Heinemeyer W. Wolf D.H. FEBS Lett. 1992; 302: 192-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar).Table IIStabilization of N-end rule substrates in gid mutant cellsN-end rule substratesWild typegid1–1gid2–1gid3–1pre1–1 pre2–1 ratioActivityRatioActivityRadioActivityRatioActivityRatioUb-Pro-β-gal0.181 :00.181 :00.181 :00.392 :23 :5Leu-β-gal0.041 :00.5313 :30.4210 :50.358 :88 :9Arg-β-gal0.031 :00.8127 :01.4548 :30.6321 :013 :6Steady-state levels of different N-end rule substrates in wild-type and gid mutant strains were measured. Cells carrying different β-galactosidase constructs, Ub-Pro-β-gal, Leu-β-gal and Arg-β-gal, were grown in the presence of galactose for 6 h to induce the β-galactosidase fusion proteins. Enzymatic activity of β-galactosidase in the crude extracts were measured as described under “Experimental Procedures” and is given in units (A 405 per A 600 per min). The data shown represents the average from three independent experiments. Data from the pre1–1 pre2–1 proteasome mutant were taken from Richter-Ruoff et al. (21Richter-Ruoff B. Heinemeyer W. Wolf D.H. FEBS Lett. 1992; 302: 192-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Open table in a new tab Steady-state levels of different N-end rule substrates in wild-type and gid mutant strains were measured.

Wolf D.H. FEBS Lett. 1992; 302: 192-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The gluconeogenic enzymes FBPase, cytosolic malate dehydrogenase, and ICL are all subject to rapid glucose-induced degradation. A sequence alignment pointed to an amino-terminal proline residue as a common feature of these enzymes (Fig. 3 A). Interestingly, this proline residue is lacking in FBPase of Saccharomyces pombeand E. coli, two FBPases that are not targets of glucose-induced breakdown. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we exchanged the amino-terminal proline of FBPase by all other 19 amino acids as described under “Experimental Procedures.” We followed the inactivation kinetics of mutated FBPases compared with the wild-type protein. Cells expressing mutated FBPases only showed a minor decrease of FBPase activity after addition of glucose (data not shown). To confirm this result, we integrated two amino-terminally mutated FBPase species, Ser1-FBPase and Trp1-FBPase, into the chromosome to get wild-type-like expression levels. We examined the fate of the respective enzyme species in a pulse-chase experiment using cells expressing the different mutated FBPase species. As can be seen in Fig. 3 B, exchanging of the amino-terminal proline of FBPase slows down its degradation dramatically. Half-life of the enzyme was 5-fold increased in cells expressing mutant Ser1-FBPase or Trp1-FBPase (Fig. 3 C). In contrast, mutation of the phosphorylation site serine residue 11 into alanine did not prevent degradation (Fig. 3,B and C). Polyubiquitination of FBPase upon glucose addition is a prerequisite for degradation of the enzyme to occur (2Schork S.M. Thumm M. Wolf D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26446-26450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). We therefore tested whether the amino-terminally mutated FBPase species Ser1-FBPase and Trp1-FBPase were still targets of the ubiquitination machinery. Cells expressing the different forms of FBPase, transformed with plasmid YEp112 expressing haUb, were derepressed on ethanol. After addition of glucose, samples were taken at different time points. Crude extracts were immunoprecipitated with FBPase antibodies, and proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and blotted onto nitrocellulose filters. Filters were then probed with ha antibodies. Neither in cells expressing Ser1-FBPase nor in cells expressing Trp1-FBPase were any ubiquitin conjugates detectable (Fig. 4). In contrast, polyubiquitination was visible for FBPase, which carried the mutated phosphorylation site serine into alanine as well for the wild-type control. The first step after addition of glucose to yeast cells grown on a non-fermentable carbon source rests in phosphorylation of the enzyme. We therefore examined the phosphorylation event in the different mutant FBPase versions. Cells expressing wild-type FBPase or mutant FBPases, respectively, were labeled with [32P]orthophosphate during derepression of the enzyme. After inducing the inactivation reaction by addition of glucose, samples were taken. Crude extracts were immunoprecipitated with FBPase antibodies, proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, and phosphorylated protein was analyzed by autoradiography. As can be seen in Fig. 5, both mutant FBPases were phosphorylated like the wild-type enzyme. As expected, only the Ala11-FBPase was not phosphorylated after the addition of glucose. Proteolysis of the N-end rule substrate ubiquitin-Pro-β-galactosidase via the ubiquitin-mediated pathway requires formation of a multiubiquitin chain by the ubiquitin fusion degradation pathway (UFD) (43Johnson E.S. Bartel B. Seufert W. Varshavsky A. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 497-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). This pathway links the multiubiquitin chain to the amino-terminal proline of the substrates. Our finding that catabolite inactivation of FBPase is dependent on the amino-terminal proline directed us to the question if the UFD is also connected to the degradation of substrates carrying a free amino-terminal proline. We therefore measured the degradation rate of FBPase after addition of glucose in yeast strains defective in the ufd genesufd1, ufd2, ufd3, and ufd5. The UFD5 gene is identical to SON1, an extragenic suppressor of a ts growth defect of certain sec63 alleles. The function of the other UFD genes is so far unknown. Immunoblot analysis indicated an unaffected glucose-induced degradation in all the ufd mutants (not shown). The same result was obtained with a ufd4 deletion strain (Fig. 6) defective in a member of the E6AP family of ubiquitin ligases. Signals leading to specific, rapid degradation of proteins are only very poorly understood. The catabolite inactivation pathway signaling selective degradation of FBPase represents an ideal model to study such a process. To get insight into this process, we isolatedgid mutants defective in glucose-induced degradation of FBPase. They fell into three complementation groups. Thegid1, gid2, and gid3 mutant cells exhibited a defect not only in degradation of FBPase but also in inactivation of cMDH, ICL, and PEPCK (Fig. 1), other enzymes subject to catabolite inactivation. As FBPase is inactivated via the proteasome, we checked for a defect in this enzyme complex using chromogenic peptide substrates, testing the three prominent proteasomal activities. These activities seemed to be unaffected, suggesting a wild-type-like proteolytic capacity of the proteasome in gid mutant strains (Fig. 2). Analysis of several N-end rule substrates, ubiquitin-X-β-galactosidase fusion proteins in gid mutant cells, unraveled a drastic stabilization especially of the short-lived Arg-β-galactosidase (Table II). This stabilization was even higher than in a proteasomal pre1–1 pre2–1 double mutant strain (21Richter-Ruoff B. Heinemeyer W. Wolf D.H. FEBS Lett. 1992; 302: 192-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). This common feature of the gid mutant cells supported the idea that FBPase, like Arg-β-galactosidase, may carry an intrinsic signal rendering this protein short-lived during catabolite inactivation. As shown in Fig. 1, besides FBPase, cMDH and ICL are catabolite inactivated. Their inactivation is affected in allgid mutants. This indicated a common signal determining these proteins for selective degradation. Sequence alignment of these proteins pointed to the amino-terminal proline residue, which is present in all three enzymes (Fig. 3 A). Interestingly, this amino-terminal proline is absent in S. pombe FBPase and E. coli FBPase, which are not degraded under conditions of catabolite inactivation (18Gamo F.J. Navas M.A. Blazquez M.A. Gancedo C. Gancedo J.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 879-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). According to the N-end rule of selective protein turnover, a free amino-terminal proline should render the respective protein metabolically stable (20Bachmair A. Finley D. Varshavsky A. Science. 1986; 234: 179-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (1366) Google Scholar). This is indeed the case for FBPase under derepressing conditions (1Funayama T. Gancedo J.M. Gancedo C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 109: 61-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Only under glucose inactivation conditions does this behavior change. We replaced the amino-terminal proline (Pro1) by other amino acids using site-directed mutagenesis. Indeed, pulse-chase analysis indicated a significant stabilization of these mutated FBPase species after glucose addition (Fig. 3). The N-end rule would predict Trp1-FBPase to be a short-lived protein and Ser1-FBPase to be a more long-lived one (20Bachmair A. Finley D. Varshavsky A. Science. 1986; 234: 179-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (1366) Google Scholar). Interestingly, glucose addition to cells abolished catabolite inactivation of both FBPase mutant forms. They exhibited a similar stability (Fig. 3, B and C). This supports the essential role of Pro1 for the recognition of FBPase by the catabolite inactivation machinery. In a previous study, polyubiquitin conjugation was found as to be a prerequisite for FBPase degradation after addition of glucose (2Schork S.M. Thumm M. Wolf D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26446-26450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Replacing Pro1 of FBPase by other amino acids also prevented the polyubiquitination of these modified forms (Fig. 4), indicating the lack of the signal for the ubiquitinating machinery. Phosphorylation of FBPase was not affected in our amino-terminal point-mutated species (Fig. 5), supporting the idea that this covalent modification is essential for rapid inactivation of the enzymatic activity but not for degradation. This is further supported by the fact that exchange of the serine residue 11 of FBPase (which is the target of phosphorylation) to alanine does not prevent catabolite degradation of the enzyme. After addition of glucose to cells, we expect the recognition of the amino-terminal proline of FBPase by specific protein components, which lead to polyubiquitination of the protein and subsequent degradation via the cytosolic 26 S proteasome. The ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes Ubc4 and Ubc5 are necessary for the ubiquitination of FBPase and the N-end rule substrate ubiquitin-Pro-β-galactosidase (2Schork S.M. Thumm M. Wolf D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26446-26450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 43Johnson E.S. Bartel B. Seufert W. Varshavsky A. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 497-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). We examined the involvement of ufd mutants, which are responsible for the degradation of ubiquitin-pro-β-galactosidase fusion protein, in catabolite degradation of FBPase but found no effect. The specificity of the ubiquitin system for a certain protein is thought to be a property of a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2) and a ubiquitin ligase (E3). However, the ubiquitin ligase, Ufd4, was not involved in this process. Obviously, the cell differentiates between a ubiquitin-linked amino-terminal proline and a free amino-terminal proline in proteins. This suggests the existence of additional ubiquitin ligases specific for the selective proteolysis of gluconeogenic enzymes. Further work will be needed to identify additional components of the catabolite inactivation system. We thank M. Hochstrasser and A. Varshavsky for plasmids and mutants. We thank S. Jäger and J.

For example, the amyloid β peptide is an invariable component of the amyloid deposits found in brains of patients with Alzheimer′s disease. The activity that sheds the ectodomain of βAPP (also known as α-secretase) acts within the amyloid peptide precluding the formation of potentially amiloidogenic, and therefore potentially pathologic, βAPP fragments (17Haass C.

Presently, it is not known the number of metalloprotease disintegrins involved in protein ectodomain shedding but it has been recently found that the activity of Kuzbanian, another member of the metalloprotease disintegrin family, is necessary for the cleavage of Notch receptors in the ectodomain, and that this cleavage is important for Notch function in Drosophila. The extracellular domain of Notch is not released to the cell media but remains at the cell surface, bound to the transmembrane cytoplasmic domains through disulfide bonds (23Pan D. Rubin G.M. Cell. 1997; 90: 271-280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar, 24Blaumueller C.M. Zagouras H.Q.P. Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Cell. 1997; 90: 281-291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the structure and function of Kuzbanian is conserved across evolution (23Pan D. Rubin G.M. Cell. 1997; 90: 271-280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar), indicating that mammalian Notch is a substrate of ADAM10, the mammalian ortholog of Kuzbanian.Little is known about the regulation of the activity of metalloprotease disintegrins. Several authors have suggested that the mechanism of activation of certain members of the metalloprotease disintegrin family is similar to that of some members of the matrix metalloprotease family (MMPs) (18Black R.A.

MMPs are synthesized as zymogens containing a prodomain with an odd number of cysteine residues, one of which blocks the active site zinc atom through a coordinate bond. MMPs become active after proteolytic removal of the propeptide. This mechanism of control of the metalloprotease activity is known as the “cysteine switch” (reviewed in Ref. 28Birkedal-Hansen H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 728-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (974) Google Scholar). The boundary between the prodomain and the metalloprotease domain of some MMPs contains a typical furin-like cleavage site composed of four basic residues. It has been shown that the MMPs stromelysin-3 and MT1-MMP are indeed proteolytically processed by furin in the Golgi compartment (29Sato H. Kinoshita T. Takino T. Nakayama K. Seiki M. FEBS Lett. 1996; 393: 101-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar, 30Pei D. Weiss S.J. Nature. 1995; 375: 244-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). Several members of the metalloprotease disintegrin family, such as TACE, MDC9, and Kuzbanian, contain in the prodomain a conserved sequence which is comparable to the cysteine switch sequences of MMPs and four basic amino acids between the prodomain and the metalloprotease domain, indicating that the mechanism of activation of these members of the metalloprotease disintegrin family includes a cysteine switch and proteolytic removal of the prodomain by furin-like convertases.Here, we show that a previously described shedding defective mutant cell line, M2, is unable to process pro-TNF-α. The target of the mutation is a gene different from TACE or PKC, since transfection of TACE does not restore TNF-α processing activity, M2 cells show no defects in PKC function and somatic cell fusions between M2 cells and TACE null cells recover the wild type phenotype. Furthermore, although the regulated shedding of βAPP is defective in TACE null cells and in M2 cells, hybrids between TACE null cells and M2 mutants show normal levels of βAPP regulated shedding. The biosynthesis and processing of TACE in mutant cells is indistinguishable from those in wild type cells. The component necessary for the activity of TACE does not seem to control all the members of the metalloprotease disintegrin family since the processing of Notch is normal in M2 cells. In summary, analysis of shedding defective cell mutants and TACE null cells reveals the existence of a component of the shedding system that tightly controls the activity of at least one member of the metalloprotease disintegrin family, involved in the shedding of relevant proteins such as pro-TNF-α or βAPP.DISCUSSIONDespite the biomedical interest of some of the proteins that undergo ectodomain shedding, best exemplified by βAPP, the proteases involved have remained elusive until recently. The first protease responsible for a shedding event to be identified, TACE, acts on pro-TNF-α and belongs to the metalloprotease disintegrin family (also known as ADAM or MDC family) (18Black R.A. Rauch C.T. Kozlosky C.J. Peschon J.J. Slack J.L. Wolfson M.F. Castner B.J. Stocking K.L. Reddy P. Srjnivasan S. Nelson N. Bolani N. Schooley K.A. Gerhart M. Davis R. Fitzner J.N. Johnson R.S.

Willard D. Bacherer J.D. Nature. 1997; 385: 733-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (1467) Google Scholar). In agreement with recent results,3 here, we show that TACE is not only necessary for the shedding of pro-TNF-α, but also for the shedding of βAPP since TACE null cells secrete significantly less soluble βAPP than control cells. Previous results from our laboratory showed that the shedding of βAPP is sensitive to TAPI (6Arribas J. Coodly L. Vollmer P. Kishimoto T.K. Rose-John S. Massagué J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11376-11382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar), a well characterized inhibitor of TACE. Therefore, the evidence at hand strongly supports that TACE is responsible for, at least, part of the shedding activity that acts on βAPP (also known as α-secretase activity) in mouse fibroblasts and CHO cells.Since the target of the mutation that affects M2, a cell line initially isolated for lack of pro-TGF-α shedding, is also necessary for the shedding of pro-TNF-α (this report), we investigated the possible effect of TACE expression in M2 cells. Expression of TACE showed little or no effect on the shedding of pro-TNF-α in M2 mutant cells, therefore we concluded that the factor defective in M2 cells is probably different from TACE. Somatic cell fusions between TACE null cells and M2 cell mutants further confirmed that the target of the mutation in the M2 cell line is not TACE but a factor necessary for its activity. On the other hand, direct biochemical evidence shows that the factor mutated in M2 cells is also different from PKC, the only known modulator of most shedding events.Previous experiments showed that the factor defective in M2 cells is also necessary for the shedding of pro-TGF-α, IL-6R,l-selectin, and a variety of anonymous cell surface molecules (6Arribas J.

The proteases responsible for the shedding of these molecules are not known, but they are probably similar to TACE, since their activity can be inhibited by TAPI. Alternatively, TACE could be a general “sheddase” controlled by the factor affected in M2 cells. In any case, the proteolytic activity(ies) acting on most, if not all, transmembrane proteins susceptible are quite unspecific since mutational analysis of residues around the cleavage site of pro-TGF-α (12Wong S.T.

Furthermore, short juxtamembrane sequences of different molecules, such as pro-TGF-α or βAPP are sufficient to confer susceptibility to the shedding system (11Arribas J. López-Casillas F. Massagué J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17160-17165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Conceivably, the factor mutated in M2 cells could be involved in restricting the proteolytic activity(ies) participating in protein ectodomain shedding and impeding unwanted proteolysis of proteins whose ectodomain should remain intact. Alternatively, it could be a potent activator of TACE or could be involved in the recognition of the substrates of TACE and other metalloprotease disintegrins.By analogy to the activation of some MMPs, it has been hypothesized that metalloprotease disintegrins containing four basic amino acids between the prodomain and the metalloprotease domain, such as TACE or MDC9, are activated by removal of the prodomain in the Golgi compartment by furin-like proprotein convertases. Analyzing the processing of transiently transfected TACE in CHO cells, we found that, although the conditions used do not lead to saturation of the machinery that processes different metalloproteases, the processing of TACE is partial. The biological significance of the molecules that are not processed is unknown, however, the results presented clearly show that the amount of processed TACE in wild type cells is comparable to that of M2 cells, indicating that the factor mutated in M2 cells is not required for the activation of metalloprotease disintegrins by removal of the propeptide.Soon after TACE was identified, the transmembrane protein Notch was found to be a substrate of another member of the metalloprotease disintegrin family, Kuzbanian (23Pan D. Rubin G.M. Cell. 1997; 90: 271-280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). To test if the factor mutated in M2 cells does also control the processing of Notch, we transfected Notch into wild type and M2 cells and analyzed its processing. The rate and extent of Notch processing is indistinguishable in wild type and mutant cell lines and is not activated by PKC, indicating that the regulation of Notch processing is different from that of other substrates of metalloprotease disintegrins and further supporting the notion that the factor mutated in M2 cells is not a general one involved in activation or trafficking of metalloprotease disintegrins. The results presented are compatible with a hypothesis in which the factor mutated in M2 cells controls the activity of a subset of metalloprotease disintegrins, that would include TACE, involved in protein ectodomain shedding.In summary, genetic and biochemical analysis of shedding defective mutants and TACE null cells reveals the involvement of TACE in the shedding of βAPP and the existence of a novel component of the shedding system that tightly controls the activity of TACE and perhaps other metalloprotease disintegrins involved in protein-ectodomain shedding. The extracellular domain of a functionally and structurally diverse group of transmembrane proteins can be shed from the cell surface via proteolytic cleavage, a process also known as ectodomain shedding. Several features are common to the shedding of the ectodomain of the majority of cell surface proteins analyzed so far. Biochemical evidence show that protein ectodomain shedding is activated via protein kinase C (PKC)1 in most, if not all, cases tested to date (1Hooper N.M. Karran E.H. Turner A.J. Biochem.

Some of the transmembrane proteins that undergo ectodomain shedding are of biomedical interest. For example, the amyloid β peptide is an invariable component of the amyloid deposits found in brains of patients with Alzheimer′s disease. The activity that sheds the ectodomain of βAPP (also known as α-secretase) acts within the amyloid peptide precluding the formation of potentially amiloidogenic, and therefore potentially pathologic, βAPP fragments (17Haass C. Selkoe D.J. Cell. 1993; 75: 1039-1042Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar). Last year, the protease responsible for the shedding of pro-TNF-α was identified and cloned (18Black R.A. Rauch C.T. Kozlosky C.J. Peschon J.J. Slack J.L. Wolfson M.F. Castner B.J. Stocking K.L.

Presently, it is not known the number of metalloprotease disintegrins involved in protein ectodomain shedding but it has been recently found that the activity of Kuzbanian, another member of the metalloprotease disintegrin family, is necessary for the cleavage of Notch receptors in the ectodomain, and that this cleavage is important for Notch function in Drosophila. The extracellular domain of Notch is not released to the cell media but remains at the cell surface, bound to the transmembrane cytoplasmic domains through disulfide bonds (23Pan D. Rubin G.M. Cell. 1997; 90: 271-280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar, 24Blaumueller C.M. Zagouras H.Q.P. Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Cell. 1997; 90: 281-291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the structure and function of Kuzbanian is conserved across evolution (23Pan D. Rubin G.M. Cell. 1997; 90: 271-280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar), indicating that mammalian Notch is a substrate of ADAM10, the mammalian ortholog of Kuzbanian. Little is known about the regulation of the activity of metalloprotease disintegrins. Several authors have suggested that the mechanism of activation of certain members of the metalloprotease disintegrin family is similar to that of some members of the matrix metalloprotease family (MMPs) (18Black R.A.

MMPs are synthesized as zymogens containing a prodomain with an odd number of cysteine residues, one of which blocks the active site zinc atom through a coordinate bond. MMPs become active after proteolytic removal of the propeptide. This mechanism of control of the metalloprotease activity is known as the “cysteine switch” (reviewed in Ref. 28Birkedal-Hansen H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 728-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (974) Google Scholar). The boundary between the prodomain and the metalloprotease domain of some MMPs contains a typical furin-like cleavage site composed of four basic residues. It has been shown that the MMPs stromelysin-3 and MT1-MMP are indeed proteolytically processed by furin in the Golgi compartment (29Sato H. Kinoshita T. Takino T. Nakayama K. Seiki M. FEBS Lett. 1996; 393: 101-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar, 30Pei D. Weiss S.J. Nature. 1995; 375: 244-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). Several members of the metalloprotease disintegrin family, such as TACE, MDC9, and Kuzbanian, contain in the prodomain a conserved sequence which is comparable to the cysteine switch sequences of MMPs and four basic amino acids between the prodomain and the metalloprotease domain, indicating that the mechanism of activation of these members of the metalloprotease disintegrin family includes a cysteine switch and proteolytic removal of the prodomain by furin-like convertases. Here, we show that a previously described shedding defective mutant cell line, M2, is unable to process pro-TNF-α. The target of the mutation is a gene different from TACE or PKC, since transfection of TACE does not restore TNF-α processing activity, M2 cells show no defects in PKC function and somatic cell fusions between M2 cells and TACE null cells recover the wild type phenotype. Furthermore, although the regulated shedding of βAPP is defective in TACE null cells and in M2 cells, hybrids between TACE null cells and M2 mutants show normal levels of βAPP regulated shedding. The biosynthesis and processing of TACE in mutant cells is indistinguishable from those in wild type cells. The component necessary for the activity of TACE does not seem to control all the members of the metalloprotease disintegrin family since the processing of Notch is normal in M2 cells. In summary, analysis of shedding defective cell mutants and TACE null cells reveals the existence of a component of the shedding system that tightly controls the activity of at least one member of the metalloprotease disintegrin family, involved in the shedding of relevant proteins such as pro-TNF-α or βAPP. DISCUSSIONDespite the biomedical interest of some of the proteins that undergo ectodomain shedding, best exemplified by βAPP, the proteases involved have remained elusive until recently. The first protease responsible for a shedding event to be identified, TACE, acts on pro-TNF-α and belongs to the metalloprotease disintegrin family (also known as ADAM or MDC family) (18Black R.A.

Willard D. Bacherer J.D. Nature. 1997; 385: 733-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (1467) Google Scholar). In agreement with recent results,3 here, we show that TACE is not only necessary for the shedding of pro-TNF-α, but also for the shedding of βAPP since TACE null cells secrete significantly less soluble βAPP than control cells. Previous results from our laboratory showed that the shedding of βAPP is sensitive to TAPI (6Arribas J. Coodly L. Vollmer P. Kishimoto T.K. Rose-John S. Massagué J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11376-11382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar), a well characterized inhibitor of TACE.

In agreement with recent results,3 here, we show that TACE is not only necessary for the shedding of pro-TNF-α, but also for the shedding of βAPP since TACE null cells secrete significantly less soluble βAPP than control cells. Previous results from our laboratory showed that the shedding of βAPP is sensitive to TAPI (6Arribas J. Coodly L. Vollmer P. Kishimoto T.K. Rose-John S. Massagué J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11376-11382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar), a well characterized inhibitor of TACE. Therefore, the evidence at hand strongly supports that TACE is responsible for, at least, part of the shedding activity that acts on βAPP (also known as α-secretase activity) in mouse fibroblasts and CHO cells. Since the target of the mutation that affects M2, a cell line initially isolated for lack of pro-TGF-α shedding, is also necessary for the shedding of pro-TNF-α (this report), we investigated the possible effect of TACE expression in M2 cells. Expression of TACE showed little or no effect on the shedding of pro-TNF-α in M2 mutant cells, therefore we concluded that the factor defective in M2 cells is probably different from TACE. Somatic cell fusions between TACE null cells and M2 cell mutants further confirmed that the target of the mutation in the M2 cell line is not TACE but a factor necessary for its activity. On the other hand, direct biochemical evidence shows that the factor mutated in M2 cells is also different from PKC, the only known modulator of most shedding events. Previous experiments showed that the factor defective in M2 cells is also necessary for the shedding of pro-TGF-α, IL-6R,l-selectin, and a variety of anonymous cell surface molecules (6Arribas J.

Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 433-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The proteases responsible for the shedding of these molecules are not known, but they are probably similar to TACE, since their activity can be inhibited by TAPI. Alternatively, TACE could be a general “sheddase” controlled by the factor affected in M2 cells. In any case, the proteolytic activity(ies) acting on most, if not all, transmembrane proteins susceptible are quite unspecific since mutational analysis of residues around the cleavage site of pro-TGF-α (12Wong S.T.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8226-8233Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) has shown a lack of sequence specificity for shedding. Furthermore, short juxtamembrane sequences of different molecules, such as pro-TGF-α or βAPP are sufficient to confer susceptibility to the shedding system (11Arribas J. López-Casillas F. Massagué J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17160-17165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Conceivably, the factor mutated in M2 cells could be involved in restricting the proteolytic activity(ies) participating in protein ectodomain shedding and impeding unwanted proteolysis of proteins whose ectodomain should remain intact. Alternatively, it could be a potent activator of TACE or could be involved in the recognition of the substrates of TACE and other metalloprotease disintegrins. By analogy to the activation of some MMPs, it has been hypothesized that metalloprotease disintegrins containing four basic amino acids between the prodomain and the metalloprotease domain, such as TACE or MDC9, are activated by removal of the prodomain in the Golgi compartment by furin-like proprotein convertases. Analyzing the processing of transiently transfected TACE in CHO cells, we found that, although the conditions used do not lead to saturation of the machinery that processes different metalloproteases, the processing of TACE is partial. The biological significance of the molecules that are not processed is unknown, however, the results presented clearly show that the amount of processed TACE in wild type cells is comparable to that of M2 cells, indicating that the factor mutated in M2 cells is not required for the activation of metalloprotease disintegrins by removal of the propeptide. Soon after TACE was identified, the transmembrane protein Notch was found to be a substrate of another member of the metalloprotease disintegrin family, Kuzbanian (23Pan D. Rubin G.M. Cell. 1997; 90: 271-280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). To test if the factor mutated in M2 cells does also control the processing of Notch, we transfected Notch into wild type and M2 cells and analyzed its processing. The rate and extent of Notch processing is indistinguishable in wild type and mutant cell lines and is not activated by PKC, indicating that the regulation of Notch processing is different from that of other substrates of metalloprotease disintegrins and further supporting the notion that the factor mutated in M2 cells is not a general one involved in activation or trafficking of metalloprotease disintegrins. The results presented are compatible with a hypothesis in which the factor mutated in M2 cells controls the activity of a subset of metalloprotease disintegrins, that would include TACE, involved in protein ectodomain shedding. In summary, genetic and biochemical analysis of shedding defective mutants and TACE null cells reveals the involvement of TACE in the shedding of βAPP and the existence of a novel component of the shedding system that tightly controls the activity of TACE and perhaps other metalloprotease disintegrins involved in protein-ectodomain shedding.

We addressed the question of whether phosphorylation is required for opioid receptor endocytosis by examining a functional, truncated mutant δ opioid receptor (DOR344T), which is missing phosphorylation sites located in the carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic domain. DOR344T receptors expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells remained predominantly in the plasma membrane, even in the presence of saturating concentrations of agonist, consistent with previous studies demonstrating strongly inhibited endocytosis of truncated receptors in this cell type. In marked contrast, DOR344T receptors expressed at similar levels in human embryonal kidney (HEK) 293 cells exhibited rapid, ligand-induced internalization either in the presence of peptide (DADLE) or alkaloid (etorphine) agonist. Quantitative assays using ELISA and flow cytometric techniques indicated that DOR344T receptors were endocytosed in HEK293 cells with similarly rapid kinetics as full-length DOR (t½ < 10 min), and both full-length DOR and DOR344T mutant receptors were endocytosed by a dynamin-dependent mechanism involving clathrin-coated pits. Nevertheless, DOR344T receptors failed to undergo any detectable constitutive or agonist-induced phosphorylation in the same cells in which dynamin-dependent endocytosis was observed. These findings establish the first example of a G protein-coupled receptor that does not require phosphorylation to undergo dynamin-dependent endocytosis, and they suggest that significant cell type-specific differences exist in the biochemical requirements for ligand-induced concentration of opioid receptors in clathrin-coated pits.

Opioid receptors are regulated by multiple mechanisms, which contribute to the physiological plasticity of the endogenous opioid system and function in the development of tolerance and dependence to opiate drugs (5Law P.-Y.

Within minutes after activation by peptide or alkaloid agonists, opioid receptors expressed in HEK293 cells are phosphorylated by G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs) (10Pei G. Kieffer B.L.

Despite the fundamental importance of these mechanisms to opiate drug action and addiction, the precise role of phosphorylation in the mechanism of opioid receptor endocytosis is not understood. Previous studies of other GPCRs suggest that mechanisms of receptor phosphorylation and endocytosis are closely related. For example, GRK-mediated phosphorylation of the carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic domain of the β2-adrenergic receptor promotes receptor interaction with β-arrestin, which thereby promotes the association of activated receptors with clathrin-coated pits (14Ferguson S.S. Zhang J. Barak L.S. Caron M.G. Life Sci. 1998; 62: 1561-1565Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 15Goodman O.J. Krupnick J.G. Santini F. Gurevich V.V. Penn R.B. Gagnon A.W. Keen J.H.

In the case of the DOR, truncation and point mutations that remove candidate phosphorylation sites located in the carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic domain strongly inhibit agonist-induced internalization observed in CHO (12Trapaidze N. Keith D.E. Cvejic S. Evans C.J. Devi L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29279-29285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) and NG108 (18Zhao J. Pei G. Huang Y.L. Zhong F.M. Ma L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 238: 71-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) cells, suggesting that a similar model may apply to opioid receptors. Consistent with this hypothesis, overexpression of either GRKs or arrestins is sufficient to enhance agonist-induced endocytosis of opioid receptors (19Zhang Z. Ferguson S.G. Barak L.S. Bodduluri S.R. Laporte S.A. Law P.-Y. Caron M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7157-7162Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar, 20Whistler J.L. von Zastrow M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9914-9919Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Interestingly, however, studies of truncated mutant μ opioid receptors suggest that phosphorylation sites located in the carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic domain play distinct roles both in promoting endocytosis of activated receptors and in preventing endocytosis in the absence of agonist (21Segredo V. Burford N.T. Lameh J. Sadee W. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 2395-2404Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). While these observations suggest a more complex function of phosphorylation of the carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic domain in modulating the membrane trafficking of opioid receptors, they also raise the more fundamental question of whether or not phosphorylation is actually required for agonist-induced endocytosis of opioid receptors. We have addressed this question by examining a truncated mutant δ opioid receptor (DOR344T) that is functional to mediate ligand-dependent signal transduction but is not phosphorylated either in the absence or presence of agonist. Surprisingly, while DOR344T mutant receptors remain predominantly in the plasma membrane of CHO cells, we have observed that these receptors undergo rapid, agonist-induced endocytosis when expressed at similar levels in HEK293 cells. Furthermore, endocytosis of DOR344T mutant receptors occurs with similarly high efficiency as full-length DOR and is mediated by a dynamin-dependent mechanism involving clathrin-coated pits. To our knowledge, this study is the first to demonstrate phosphorylation-independent endocytosis of any GPCR by clathrin-coated pits. In addition, these observations suggest that significant cell type-specific differences exist in the biochemical requirements for the entry of activated opioid receptors into a dynamin-dependent endocytic pathway. The DOR344T truncated mutant receptor was constructed by engineering a stop codon following residue 344 in the coding sequence of the FLAG-tagged murine DOR described previously (11Keith D.E. Murray S.R. Zaki P.A. Chu P.C. Lissin D.V. Kang L. Evans C.J. von Zastrow M. J. Biol.

Receptor cDNAs were cloned into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) and verified by dideoxynucleotide sequencing (Sequenase, U. S.

CHO cells and HEK293 cells (American Type Culture Collection) were maintained and passaged in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (University of California, San Francisco Cell Culture Facility). Cell monolayers grown in 6-cm dishes were transfected with cDNA constructs cloned into pcDNA3 using calcium phosphate (23Okayama H. Berg P. Bio/Technology. 1992; 24: 270-279PubMed Google Scholar). Transiently transfected cells were examined 48 72 h after transfection. Stably transfected cell clones derived from HEK293 cells were selected using 0.5 mg/ml G418 (Geneticin, Life Technologies, Inc.). Relative levels of expression and uniformity of expression were evaluated using flow cytometry and immunofluorescence microscopy as described previously (11Keith D.E. Murray S.R. Zaki P.A. Chu P.C.

The functional integrity of the DOR344T mutant receptor was confirmed by assay of receptor-mediated inhibition of adenylyl cyclase (11Keith D.E. Murray S.R. Zaki P.A. Chu P.C. Lissin D.V. Kang L.

DOR344T mutant receptors mediated agonist-dependent inhibition of adenylyl cyclase activity in these cells (57 ± 12% inhibition in the presence of 5 μm etorphine; 61 ± 14% inhibition in the presence of 5 μm DADLE, n = 3), indicating that DOR344T mutant receptors are functional. Stably transfected HEK293 cells expressing either full-length DOR or DOR344T mutant receptors at similar levels were plated in 10-cm dishes containing phosphate-free DMEM supplemented with 2% dialyzed fetal bovine serum (University of California, San Francisco Cell Culture Facility) and metabolically labeled for 3 h with 0.5 mCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate (6000 Ci/mmol, NEN Life Science Products). Cells were then incubated in the absence or presence of 10 μm DADLE or etorphine for the indicated time periods, then transferred to ice and immediately extracted in 1 ml/dish ice-cold extraction buffer (25 mm NaHEPES, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mmCaCl2, 50 mm NaF, 80 mmβ-glycerol phosphate, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml, pepstatin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and receptors were immunoprecipitated from extracts using M1 anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody (3 μg/ml, Kodak Scientific Imaging Systems) and protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Immunoprecipitates were washed extensively by centrifugation in wash buffer (25 mm NaHEPES, pH 7.4, 50 mmNaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mm CaCl2), then immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Gels were either dried and exposed directly to a PhosphorImager plate (Molecular Dynamics, Inc.) for autoradiography or were electrotransferred to nitrocellulose membranes (24Towbin H. Gordon J. J. Immunol. Methods. 1984; 72: 313-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar) for autoradiography followed by immunoblotting of the same membrane using biotinylated M1 anti-FLAG antibody, horseradish peroxidase-streptavidin, and chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) to detect receptor protein. Immunoblots were quantitated by densitometric scanning of film (Kodak BioMax) exposed in the linear range. Immunocytochemical localization of epitope-tagged opioid receptors in fixed specimens was performed using M1 anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody (3 μg/ml) as described previously (11Keith D.E. Murray S.R.

Specific visualization of opioid receptor endocytosis by translocation of antibody-labeled receptors from the plasma membrane to intracellular membranes was performed using a previously established protocol (13Chu P.

Dual localization of FLAG-tagged receptors and HA-tagged dynamin in the same cells was performed as described (13Chu P. Murray S. Lissin D. von Zastrow M. J. Biol.

Conventional fluorescence microscopy was performed using a Nikon inverted microscope equipped with a 60× NA1.4 objective and standard epifluorescence optics. Confocal fluorescence microscopy was performed using a Bio-Rad MRC1000 confocal imaging system interfaced to a Zeiss inverted microscope equipped with a 100× NA1.3 objective. Receptor internalization was quantitated using fluorescence flow cytometry as described previously (11Keith D.E. Murray S.R. Zaki P.A. Chu P.C. Lissin D.V. Kang L. Evans C.J. von Zastrow M. J. Biol.

Briefly, stably transfected HEK293 cells expressing FLAG-tagged receptors were incubated at 37 °C under the conditions indicated, then chilled on ice to stop membrane trafficking. Receptors present in the plasma membrane were specifically labeled by incubating intact cells with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated M1 anti-FLAG antibody (3 μg/ml) at 4 °C for 1 h, then the surface receptor staining intensity of antibody-labeled cells was analyzed using fluorescence flow cytometry (FACScan, Becton Dickenson, Palo Alto, CA). Kinetic parameters were estimated by performing a best-fit of the flow cytometric data to a first order exponential function. Receptor internalization was also assayed in stably transfected cells using a cell surface ELISA method to quantitate the ligand-induced loss of epitope-tagged opioid receptors from the plasma membrane, as described (25Hein L.

When expressed in CHO cells, DOR344T mutant receptors remained predominantly in the plasma membrane and were markedly impaired in agonist-induced internalization relative to full-length DOR (compare Fig. 1, A and B withC and D), consistent with previous studies demonstrating nearly complete inhibition of agonist-induced internalization of similar truncated mutant receptors in this cell type (12Trapaidze N.

Surprisingly, the same experiment conducted in HEK293 cells yielded significantly different results. In these cells, both full-length DOR and DOR344T mutant receptors redistributed rapidly from the plasma membrane to endocytic vesicles in response to either etorphine or DADLE (Fig. 2 A–C and D–F, respectively). This rapid, agonist-induced internalization of DOR344T mutant receptors was observed consistently in multiple experiments and in cells expressing mutant opioid receptors over an approximately 10-fold range of expression levels, as estimated by immunocytochemical staining intensity measured using a digital cooled charge-coupled device camera (not shown).Figure 2Rapid internaliztion of both full-length DOR and DOR344T mutant receptors in HEK293 cells. Transiently transfected HEK293 cells expressing full-length DOR (A–C) or DOR344T mutant receptors (D–F) were labeled with M1 antibody and incubated for 30 min in the absence of agonist (A and D), in the presence of 5 μmetorphine (B and E), or in the presence of 5 μm DADLE (C and F). Confocal microscopy was then used to visualize the redistribution of antibody-labeled receptors, as in Fig. 1. In the absence of agonist, both wild type and truncated receptors were associated predominantly with the plasma membrane (A and D, respectively). In the presence of 5 μm etorphine (B and E) or 5 μm DADLE (C and F), both full-length and DOR344T mutant receptors redistributed within 30 min from the plasma membrane into numerous intracellular vesicles. Fluorescence flow cytometry was used to measure the internalization of receptors induced by 5 μmetorphine (G) or 5 μm DADLE (H). In these experiments, receptors were labeled with antibody after incubating cells with ligands and chilling cells to 4 °C to stop membrane trafficking (see “Experimental Procedures”), to confirm that receptor internalization observed was not caused by antibody. Each data point represents the mean ± S.D. of receptor internalization, determined by loss of receptor immunoreactivity from the cell surface, determined in an analysis of 5000 cells performed in triplicate. A least squares fit of these data to a single exponential function estimated that both full-length and DOR344T mutant receptors are internalized with similarly rapid kinetics in response to etorphine (t½ ∼ 4.4 and 5.1 min, respectively) or DADLE (t½ ∼ 10.0 and 5.9 min, respectively).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The ability of DOR344T mutant receptors to undergo rapid, agonist-induced endocytosis in HEK293 cells was confirmed in stably transfected cells using quantitative assays of receptor internalization.

Chem. 1994; 269: 27719-27726Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) indicated that both full-length and DOR344T mutant receptors expressed in several different clones of HEK293 cells exhibited >40% internalization after 30 min in the presence of 5 μm etorphine or DADLE (not shown). Fluorescence flow cytometry was next used to examine the kinetics of receptor endocytosis in cell clones (DOR#5 and DOR344T#4) expressing DOR or DOR344T mutant receptors at similar levels (1.5–2.5 × 105 receptors/cell). These expression levels were chosen because they are closely comparable with those examined previously in stably transfected CHO cells, in which >70% inhibition of agonist-induced internalization of truncated mutant δ opioid receptors was observed using an identical flow cytometric assay (12Trapaidze N. Keith D.E. Cvejic S. Evans C.J. Devi L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29279-29285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). In agreement with the fluorescence microscopy and cell surface ELISA assays, rapid agonist-induced endocytosis of both full-length DOR and DOR344T mutant receptors in HEK293 cells was readily observed, as indicated by the rapid removal of receptors from the plasma membrane induced by either etorphine or DADLE (Fig. 2, G and H). Kinetic analysis of these data indicated that both receptors were internalized with similarly rapid kinetics (t½ < 10 min) in the presence of either agonist (Fig. 2, legend), while minimal (<5%) internalization of both DOR and DOR344T mutant receptors was observed after 30 min in the absence of agonist or in the presence of the antagonist naloxone (10 μm, not shown). Thus, in contrast to the nearly complete inhibition of agonist-induced internalization of truncated mutant opioid receptors observed previously in CHO cells, DOR344T mutant receptors expressed at similar levels in HEK293 cells undergo agonist-induced endocytosis with similarly rapid kinetics as full-length DOR. We next examined whether the agonist-induced endocytosis of DOR344T mutant receptors observed in HEK293 cells was mediated by the same mechanism as that of full-length δ opioid receptors. Both full-length DOR and DOR344T truncated mutant receptors were visualized in transferrin-positive endocytic vesicles in cells incubated in the presence of etorphine or DADLE, and agonist-induced endocytosis of both receptors was strongly inhibited in mildly hypertonic media (DMEM supplemented with 0.35 m sucrose, not shown), suggesting that both receptors are endocytosed by clathrin-coated pits. Furthermore, endocytosis of both receptors was observed to be specifically inhibited by K44E mutant dynamin I, which specifically blocks endocytosis mediated by clathrin-coated pits in a dominant negative manner (22Herskovits J.S. Burgess C.C. Obar R.A. Vallee R.B. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 565-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar, 27Damke H. Baba T. Warnock D.E. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 915-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (1045) Google Scholar). In cells expressing K44E mutant dynamin (Fig. 3 A, solid arrow), full-length δ opioid receptors remained in the plasma membrane even after 30 min in the presence of a saturating concentration (5 μm) of etorphine (Fig. 3 B, solid arrow). In contrast, etorphine-induced endocytosis of receptors was readily observed in adjacent cells visualized in the same specimens that did not express mutant dynamin (Fig. 3, A and B, open arrow). Endocytosis of DOR344T mutant receptors was also inhibited in cells expressing K44E mutant dynamin (Fig. 3, D and E, solid arrow) but not in adjacent cells that did not express mutant dynamin (Fig. 3,D and E, open arrow). Quantitation of these results using a previously established antibody uptake assay (5Law P.-Y. Hom D.S. Loh H.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1982; 72: 1-4Google Scholar) confirmed these observations and indicated the biochemical specificity of this inhibition, as no inhibition of endocytosis was observed in cells expressing wild type dynamin I at similar levels (Fig. 3,C and F, respectively). Thus DOR344T mutant receptors expressed in HEK293 cells are endocytosed by a similar clathrin- and dynamin-dependent mechanism as full-length opioid receptors. The ability of DOR344T mutant opioid receptors to undergo rapid, dynamin-dependent endocytosis in HEK293 cells raised the question of whether these receptors may be phosphorylated in this cell type. To address this question, we assayed in vivophosphorylation of opioid receptors in the same stably transfected cell clones in which receptor endocytosis was examined. HEK293 cells expressing similar levels of full-length (clone DOR#5) or mutant (clone DOR344T#4) receptors were metabolically labeled with [32P]orthophosphate, incubated in the presence or absence of various agonists, then receptors were isolated from cell lysates by immunoprecipitation and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis autoradiography (Fig. 4 A). Nonspecific signal in these experiments was negligible (lane 1), while a small amount of constitutive phosphorylation of full-length δ opioid receptors was observed in cells incubated in the absence of agonist (lane 2). When incubated in the presence of either alkaloid (etorphine) or peptide (DADLE) agonist, phosphorylation of full-length δ opioid receptors was strongly stimulated, as indicated by the appearance of a heavily phosphorylated band of immunopurified receptor (lanes 3 and 4) corresponding to the mature form of the receptor glycoprotein (solid arrow). In contrast, DOR344T mutant receptors expressed at similar levels and analyzed in the same manner exhibited no detectable phosphorylation, either in the absence of agonist or in the presence of saturating concentrations of etorphine or DADLE (Fig. 4 A, lanes 5–7; open arrow indicates position in the gel of the mature truncated mutant receptor protein). These results were replicated in experiments in which identical samples were analyzed by autoradiography (Fig. 4 B, upper panel) and immunoblotting (Fig. 4 B, lower panel) to confirm that essentially identical amounts of receptor protein were present in each sample. Quantitation by PhosphorImager scanning indicated that agonist-induced phosphorylation of DOR344T mutant opioid receptors was completely (>95%) blocked at all time points examined, from 5 to 30 min after the addition of agonist. In conclusion, the present studies demonstrate that phosphorylation is not required for dynamin-dependent endocytosis of a truncated mutant opioid receptor. Although phosphorylation is not required for endocytosis of certain other GPCRs (28Haribabu B. Richardson R.M. Fisher I. Sozzani S. Peiper S.C. Horuk R. Ali H. Snyderman R. J. Biol.

Thus, to our knowledge, the present results are the first to establish phosphorylation-independent endocytosis of any GPCR by clathrin-coated pits. Previous studies indicate that phosphorylation of the carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic domain is required for agonist-induced endocytosis of opioid receptors in CHO and NG108 cells (12Trapaidze N.

Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 238: 71-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Our studies of receptor localization in CHO cells are consistent with this conclusion, suggesting that significant differences exist among individual cell types in biochemical requirements for the regulated endocytosis of opioid receptors. Interestingly, while overexpression of GRKs or arrestins is sufficient to enhance endocytosis of opioid receptors (19Zhang Z. Ferguson S.G. Barak L.S. Bodduluri S.R. Laporte S.A. Law P.-Y. Caron M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7157-7162Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar, 20Whistler J.L. von Zastrow M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9914-9919Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar), these proteins are expressed endogenously in CHO and HEK293 cells at closely similar levels and β2-adrenergic receptors internalize in both cell types with similarly high efficiency (16Menard L. Ferguson S.S. Zhang J. Lin F.T. Lefkowitz R.J. Caron M.G. Barak L.S. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 800-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Thus we speculate that additional cellular protein(s), distinct from GRKs and arrestins, may be differentially expressed among these cell types and mediate the observed cell type-specific differences in phosphorylation-independent endocytosis of receptors. The identification of these proteins and the mechanism by which they function is an important goal for future studies. The present studies make a significant step in this direction by establishing, for the first time, that dynamin-dependent endocytosis of opioid receptors can occur in the absence of receptor phosphorylation and that significant cell type-specific differences exist in the biochemical requirements for agonist-induced association of opioid receptors with clathrin-coated pits.

We carried out in vivotranslation/insertion experiments in Xenopus oocytes with combined wild type or mutant membrane segments of the α-subunit of the heterodimeric Na,K-ATPase linked to a glycosylation reporter sequence. We confirm that the four N-terminal hydrophobic segments of the α-subunit behave as alternating signal anchor/stop transfer motifs necessary for two lipid-inserted membrane pairs.

Many of the important details of the membrane insertion and the maturation of polytopic, oligomeric membrane proteins are still obscure (for reviews, see Refs. 1Deber C.M. Goto N.K. von Heijne G. Membrane Protein Assembly. Springer-Verlag, Heidelberg, Germany1997: 25-34Google Scholar, 2High S. Laird V.

During the membrane integration, these membrane proteins are subjected to an initial folding process, which is mediated by specific α-helical packing (for a review see Ref. 4Lemmon M.A. MacKenzie K.R. Arkin I.T. Engelman D.M. von Heijne G. Membrane Protein Assembly. Springer-Verlag, Heidelberg, Germany1997: 3-20Google Scholar), interaction with molecular chaperones, and co-translational modifications (for a review, see Ref. 5Ruddon R.W. Bedows E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3125-3128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Finally, in the case of oligomeric proteins, the maturation process is completed by the assembly of different subunits (for a review, see Ref. 6Geering K. von Heijne G. Membrane Protein Assembly. Springer-Verlag, Heidelberg, Germany1997: 173-182Google Scholar). Each maturation step is necessary to ultimately result in the correct tertiary structure of oligomeric proteins that is compatible with intracellular transport and function. Analysis of many polytopic membrane proteins is consistent with a model according to which these proteins are produced by the sequential insertion into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)1 membrane of signal anchor and stop transfer motifs that generally contain a sequence of about 23 amino acids favoring an α-helical conformation and are interrupted by a run of hydrophilic amino acids. The insertion of the first ER-targeting sequence is mediated by the signal recognition particle, which interrupts translation until docked with the signal recognition particle receptor on the ER membrane. Subsequent transmembrane regions are thought to insert without involvement of signal recognition particle. During the integration process, polytopic proteins are found adjacent to the Sec61 complex and TRAM, which together form a polar, transmembrane channel as part of the translocon. The Sec61-TRAM complex permits the insertion of the signal anchor sequences and passage of succeeding hydrophilic regions of membrane proteins until the insertion of stop transfer sequences into the ER membrane. The complex also mediates the transfer of the transmembrane domains, perhaps during or even after completion of synthesis of the entire protein, from the aqueous translocation channel into the lipid bilayer. This general model of membrane insertion may have to be modified based on a requirement for specific sequences upstream, downstream, or within membrane-targeted, hydrophobic sequences. Other subunits of an oligomeric protein may also assist in correct membrane insertion. These ideas have not been investigated in detail for polytopic membrane proteins. Na,K-ATPase, an oligomeric member of the P-type ATPase family, was used as a model protein to study these questions. In addition to the catalytic α-subunit, which is a polytopic membrane protein, Na,K-ATPases contains a β-subunit, which is a type II membrane protein. The number and position of transmembrane segments in the α-subunit of Na,K-ATPase and in H,K- and the ER Ca-ATPase have been determined by biochemical, immunological, and mutational analysis (for review and references, see Refs. 7Moller J.V. Juul B. Lemaire M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1286: 1-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar and 8Bayle D. Weeks D. Hallen S. Melchers K. Bamberg K. Sachs G. J. Receptor Signal Transduction Res. 1997; 17: 29-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). A 10-transmembrane segment topological model with the N and the C termini located in the cytoplasm is now widely accepted for the α-subunit in the functional Na,K- and H,K-ATPase, e.g. when it is associated with the β-subunit (for a review, see Ref. 9Karlish S.J.D. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1997; 834: 30-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). There is clear prediction, using a variety of algorithms, of four N-terminal transmembrane sequences (M1 to M4) in α-subunits of P-type ATPases. These are followed by a long cytoplasmic region containing about 400 amino acids, which contains the phosphorylation and the ATP (fluorescein 5′-isothiocyanate) binding sites. After this, there is a relatively long hydrophobic sequence (M5-M6) that does not appear to contain the hydrophilic sequences necessary for separation of two membrane insertion signals. This sequence is followed by four domains of varying hydrophobicity (M7–M10) that make up the C-terminal part of the protein that are usually predicted as being membrane-spanning. Low resolution crystal structure of the membrane sector of SR Ca-ATPase has been interpreted as showing the presence of a core and a peripheral domain (10Zhang P. Toyoshima C. Yonekura K. Green N.M. Stokes D.L. Nature. 1998; 392: 835-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). In this structure, there are therefore segments that strongly interact with the lipid bilayer and segments that interact more with other transmembrane segments. These latter segments may show membrane insertion properties that are distinct and may require additional sequence information to be insertion-competent. Results of in vitro translation of M5 and M6 of the Na,K- (11Xie Y. Langhans-Rajasekaran S.A. Bellovino D. Morimoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2563-2573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), H,K- (12Bamberg K. Sachs G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16909-16919Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), or SR Ca-ATPases (13Bayle D. Weeks D. Sachs G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25678-25684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) have been consistent in being unable to show the signal anchor and the stop transfer properties expected of a membrane pair interacting solely with membrane lipids. In addition, in the heterodimeric P-type ATPases, the association of the β-subunit with the extracytoplasmic region between M7 and M8 may influence the stability and folding of the C-terminal part of the α-subunit during translation, since the β-subunit has to be present for the α-subunit to become trypsin-resistant, to be protected from cellular degradation, and to become functionally active (14Geering K. Beggah A. Good P. Girardet S. Roy S. Schaer D. Jaunin P. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 1193-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). After expression in intact Xenopus oocytes, we have analyzed in this study the intrinsic and extrinsic sequence dependence of putative transmembrane sequences of α-subunits of Na,K-ATPase for behavior as signal anchor or stop transfer sequences as well as the effect of β-assembly on the topographical features of the α-subunit. As a test for membrane insertion, we followed the presence or absence of glycosylation of chimera containing single or multiple transmembrane segments of the α-subunit and the ectodomain of the β-subunit, which contains several glycosylation sites. Our results indicate that intrinsic structural information other than hydrophobicity provides quantitatively variable signal anchor or stop transfer function to each transmembrane segment of the α-subunit of Na,K-ATPases. The intrinsic membrane insertion properties of C-terminal membrane sequences are shown to be essential for the transport function of the enzyme. Finally, assembly with the β-subunit through interaction with the extracytoplasmic loop between M7 and M8 is important for the correct membrane insertion of the M7 and M8 pair. Chimeras contained different regions of the N terminus of the α1-subunit of Xenopus laevisNa,K-ATPase (15Verrey F. Kairouz P. Schaerer E. Fuentes P. Geering K. Rossier B.C. Kraehenbuhl J.-P Am. J.

Horisberger J.D. Rossier B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16895-16903Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) containing four glycosylation sites. To create the chimera, KpnI and HindIII restriction sites were introduced at different sites into the α cDNA in a pSD5 vector by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method of Nelson and Long (17Nelson R.M. Long G.L. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 180: 147-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar), and the β ectodomain previously digested by KpnI and HindIII, was added. The introduction of single or double point mutations into the cDNA of chimera or the full-length α-subunit was also performed by PCR.Table IDescription of α mutants of Xenopus Na,K-ATPase and summary of resultsIndicted is the figure in which the mutants appear with the indicated name, which specifies the number of membrane segments contained in the mutant and the point mutations introduced. α mutants 1-46 start at Met1.

The transmembrane segments are indicated by M1 through M10, and “el” represents the ∼32-amino acid-long extracytoplasmic loop between M7 and M8. The chimeras M1–2/M7el, M1–2/M7elM8, M1–2/M7el Q858L/Q869L, and M1–2/7el8 Q858L/Q869L (for description of mutants, see Table I) were prepared by 1) PCR amplification of the C termini of the constructs M7el, M7elM8, M7el Q858L/Q869L, and M7el8 Q858L/Q869L with a sense oligonucleotide containing a HpaI site and an antisense oligonucleotide containing KpnI,HindIII, and XbaI restriction sites, 2) digestion of the amplified fragments, and 3) subcloning by using aHpaI site and the XbaI site present in the pSD5 vector. The β1 fragment was then introduced between theKpnI and the HindIII sites. To investigate the role of the interaction of the extracytoplasmic loop domain with the β-subunit, chimeras M1–3el and M1–3/el8 were prepared by recombinant PCR. Briefly, one fragment from the M1–3 region was amplified with an antisense oligonucleotide containing a short overlap of the extracytoplasmic loop region (for description see Table I), whereas another fragment was amplified from the C termini of the extracytoplasmic loop or el8 constructs with a sense oligonucleotide containing a short overlap of the M1–3 region and an antisense oligonucleotide containing KpnI,HindIII, and XbaI restriction sites. The two amplified fragments were then joined by recombinant PCR. The chimeras M1–3/8 and M1–3/el/4 were prepared by 1) introduction of a EcoRI site into the wild type α or the M1–3/el8 cDNA at nt1010; 2) amplification of the C termini of the construct M8 or M4, respectively, with a sense oligonucleotide containing aEcoRI site and the antisense oligonucleotide containingKpnI, HindIII, and XbaI restriction sites; and 3) subcloning of the amplified fragment into the wild type α or the M1–3/el8 cDNAc by using a EcoRI site and aXbaI site present in the pSD5 vector. In the M1–3/el/4, alanine 322 was changed to phenylalanine. All constructs generated by PCR amplification were sequenced by dideoxy sequencing. The Xenopus β1 was epitope-tagged for the use of radiolabeling binding assays (see below) as described earlier (18Beguin P. Wang X.Y. Firsov D. Puoti A. Claeys D. Horisberger J.D. Geering K. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4250-4260Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). The Flag sequence replaced the sequence194NSLPPEM200, thereby deleting the second glycosylation site. The flags are recognized by the anti-Flag M2 (Eastman Kodak Co.). Stage V-VI oocytes were obtained from X. laevis females (Noordhoek, Republic of South Africa) as described previously (14Geering K. Beggah A. Good P. Girardet S. Roy S. Schaer D. Jaunin P. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 1193-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). In vitro synthesized RNA (cRNA) was prepared according to Meltonet al. (19Melton D.A. Krieg P.A. Rebagliati M.R. Maniatis T. Zinn K. Green M.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 7035-7056Crossref PubMed Scopus (4057) Google Scholar). Routinely, 8–10 ng of chimeric α cRNA of Na,K-ATPase and/or 0.5 ng of β cRNA of Xenopus Na,K-ATPase was injected into oocytes. Oocytes were metabolically labeled with 0.6 mCi/ml of [35S]methionine (Hartmann Analytic) for 24 h and in some instances subjected to a 48-h chase period. Microsomal fractions were prepared, and the pellets were taken up in 0.5% digitonin and subjected to immunoprecipitation under denaturing or nondenaturing conditions (14Geering K. Beggah A. Good P. Girardet S. Roy S. Schaer D. Jaunin P. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 1193-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) with polyclonal antibodies against α- or β-subunits of Na,K-ATPase (20Ackermann U. Geering K. FEBS Lett. 1990; 269: 105-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Endoglycosidase H (Endo H) (Calbiochem) treatment was performed as before (21Jaunin P. Jaisser F. Beggah A.T. Takeyasu K. Mangeat P. Rossier B.C. Horisberger J.D. Geering K. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1751-1759Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) in order to determine the location of the C terminus of the newly synthesized α-chimera. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed on the immunoprecipitated proteins without or with Endo H treatment, and the protein pattern was quantified by densitometry with a LKB 2202 Ultrascan. The binding assay was performed as described (18Beguin P. Wang X.Y. Firsov D. Puoti A. Claeys D. Horisberger J.D. Geering K. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4250-4260Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar), 3 days after Xenopus α and β cRNA injection. Twelve oocytes were incubated on ice for 30 min in modified Barth's solution supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated calf serum. The addition of a 70 nm concentration of the iodinated antibody, in a final volume of 100 μl, initiated binding. After a 1-h incubation on ice, the oocytes were washed and subjected individually to γ-counting. Nonspecific binding was determined on oocytes expressing untagged β-subunits and accounted for <10% of total binding. Immunoradiolabeling of the flagged β-subunit expressed in oocytes with α-subunits provides a direct measurement of the number of Na,K-pumps expressed at the cell surface, since it was previously shown that flagged β-subunits cannot reach the plasma membrane alone and do not influence the number of Na,K-pumps expressed (18Beguin P. Wang X.Y. Firsov D. Puoti A. Claeys D. Horisberger J.D. Geering K. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4250-4260Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Ouabain binding to oocyte was essentially done as described previously (21Jaunin P. Jaisser F. Beggah A.T. Takeyasu K. Mangeat P. Rossier B.C. Horisberger J.D. Geering K. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1751-1759Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Oocytes were preincubated for 2 h in a nominally K+-free solution to load the oocytes with Na+. Ouabain binding was performed in a solution containing 90 mm NaCl, 2 mmCaCl2, 5 mm BaCl2, 20 mm tetraethylammonium chloride, 5 mm MOPS, pH 7.4, and 1 μm [21,22-3H]ouabain (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 20 min at room temperature. Nonspecific ouabain binding determined in the presence of a 1000-fold excess of cold ouabain accounted to 3–7% of the total binding. The transport activity of wild type and mutant Na,K-ATPase complexes was measured as the potassium-activated Na,K-pump current in Na+-loaded oocytes by using the two-electrode voltage clamp technique as described previously (22Jaisser F. Jaunin P. Geering K. Rossier B.C. Horisberger J.D. J. Gen. Physiol. 1994; 103: 605-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Functional expression of Na,K-pumps and kinetics of activation by K+ were studied in the presence of external Na+ (80 mm sodium gluconate, 0.82 mm MgCl2, 0.41 mmCaCl2, 10 mm N-methyl-d-glucamine-HEPES, 5 mmBaCl2, 10 mm tetraethylammonium chloride, pH 7.4) and in the absence of external Na+ (sodium gluconate replaced by 140 mm sucrose). The current induced by increasing concentrations of K+ (with Na+: 0.3, 1.0, and 3.3 10 mm K+; without Na+: 0.02, 0.10, 0.50, and 5.0 mm K+) was measured at −50 mV. The maximal current (I max) and the half-activation constant (K½) of exogenous pumps were obtained after subtraction of the pump current of endogenous pumps at each K+ concentration. The corrected data were fitted to the Hill equation using a Hill coefficient of 1.6 for experiments in the presence of external Na+ and of 1.0 for experiments in the absence of external Na+ as described previously (22Jaisser F. Jaunin P. Geering K. Rossier B.C. Horisberger J.D. J. Gen. Physiol. 1994; 103: 605-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). N-Glycosylation of newly synthesized proteins only occurs in the ER lumen. Therefore, the presence or absence of glycosylation of a C-terminal reporter sequence containingN-glycosylation sites can be used to determine whether a translated sequence ends on the luminal or the cytoplasmic side of the membrane if one assumes that all membrane-integrated protein is glycosylated. We used this approach 1) to define the topographic properties of transmembrane segments of the Na,K-ATPase α-subunit,e.g. their ability to act as signal anchor (SA) or stop transfer (ST) sequences and 2) to identify topographic changes in the α-subunit that are induced by the assembly with the β-subunit. Glycosylation of α deletion mutants containing at their C terminus the glycosylation-competent ectodomain of a β-subunit was followed after expression in Xenopus oocytes by cRNA injection, metabolic labeling, and immunoprecipitation. Endo H, which specifically cleaves N-linked high mannose core sugars, was used to distinguish glycosylated from nonglycosylated protein species after SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. As previously reported using in vitro translation (23Homareda H. Kawakami K. Nagano K. Matsui H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 5742-5745Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Xie Y. Morimoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11985-11991Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), the four N-terminal membrane segments of the Na,K-ATPase α-subunit are efficiently membrane-integrated during synthesis in vivo (Fig. 1). Transmembrane segment M1 was co-translationally inserted into the membrane (not shown), and the addition of M2, acting as a ST sequence, prevented glycosylation of the M1–2 protein (Fig. 1 A, lanes 1 and 2; for description of constructs see Table I), which reflects the formation of the first transmembrane pair. The M1–3 protein again became glycosylated (lanes 3 and 4), confirming the SA function of M3. Finally, the M1–4 protein was not well expressed in oocytes, but M4 consistently prevented glycosylation (lanes 5 and 6), indicating that, in its natural context, M4 acts as a ST sequence. In contrast to the complete membrane insertion of M1 and M3, only partial membrane insertion was observed for M5, M7, and M9 of the Na,K-ATPase α-subunit. 5–10% of the M1–5 protein was Endo H-sensitive and glycosylated, whether the construct extended up to Gly815 (Fig. 1B, lanes 1–4) or up to Leu804(data not shown). 40–50% of the M1–7 protein (Fig. 1 B, lanes 5 and 6) or of the M1–7el protein containing the extracytoplasmic loop between M7 and M8 (data not shown) became glycosylated, and finally between 40 and 60% of M9 in the M1–9 protein was Endo H-sensitive (lanes 9 and 10). We consistently observed that the nonglycosylated species of M5, M7, and M9 in the M1–5 (Fig. 1 B, lanes 3 and 4), M1–7 (lanes 7 and 8), and M1–9 (lanes 11 and 12) proteins, respectively, were completely degraded after a chase period, but the glycosylated, Endo H-sensitive species were stable. This observation provided an additional means to distinguish between the closely migrating glycosylated and nonglycosylated species of high molecular mass α constructs. The degree of membrane integration was distinct and consistent for each of these membrane segments and did not change after longer pulse periods (data not shown), indicating that M5, M7, and M9 contain distinct structural information, which only permits partial and membrane segment-specific SA function in the case where these segments are not followed by other transmembrane segments. M6, M8, and M10 in the M1–6 (Fig. 1 A, lanes 7 and 8), M1–8 (lanes 9and 10), and M1–10 (lanes 11 and 12) proteins, respectively, were Endo H-resistant and not glycosylated, indicating that they can all form a pair with the preceding segment, which may or may not be membrane-inserted in α-subunits synthesized without a β-subunit. An interactive domain with the β-subunit has been identified in the extracytoplasmic loop between M7 and M8 in the α-subunit of the Na,K-ATPase (25Colonna T.E. Huynh L. Fambrough D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12366-12372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). To test whether β-association with this domain may influence the topographic features of the α-subunit, we co-expressed the β-subunit with the M1–7el protein containing the β-assembly (extracytoplasmic loop) domain or with M1–8, M1–9, or M1–10 proteins. Nondenaturing immunoprecipitations with an α-antibody showed co-immunoprecipitation and thus assembly of the β-subunit with all of these constructs (Fig. 1 C, lanes 1–4). In M1–7, M1–8, and M1–10 proteins, the glycosylation pattern did not change in the presence of β-subunits (compare Fig. 1 C, lane 1, with Fig. 1 B, lane 5; compare Fig. 1 C, lanes 2and 4, with Fig. 1 A, lanes 9 and 11). On the other hand, in the M1–9 protein, the proportion of glycosylated species decreased from about 50% in the absence of β-subunits (Fig. 1 B, lane 9) to 20% in the presence of β-subunits (Fig. 1 C, lane 3), indicating that association with the β-subunit impedes the SA function of M9 in the M1–9 protein. Thus, β-subunit assembly with the interactive extracytoplasmic loop region in the extracytoplasmic loop between M7 and M8 can influence membrane insertion at least of partial constructs of the Na,K-ATPase α-subunit. The results of Fig. 1 are summarized in Table I. We studied in more detail the importance of some of the amino acids present in the sequences for the observed membrane insertion properties of M7 and M9 in unassembled α-subunits and also evaluated effects of changing specific upstream sequences. M7 but not M9 retained SA function when they were added to the rigid membrane pair M1–2. Similar to M1–7el, 40–50% of the M1–2/7el (for description, see Table I) population became Endo H-sensitive and thus glycosylated after expression in oocytes (Fig. 2 A, lanes 1 and 2), confirming that M7 has an intrinsic, although partial, SA function that is independent of specific interaction with preceding or succeeding transmembrane segments. In contrast, M1–2/9 (in which M9 was next to M1–2) was completely Endo H-resistant (lanes 3 and 4), indicating that SA function of M9 is impeded by a preceding stable membrane pair. M9 contains two adjacent negatively charged residues, Glu962 and Glu963, and a polar residue Thr964. These residues were changed to Leu to test whether they influence the membrane insertion of M9 in the M1–9 protein. Replacement of all three residues led to complete membrane insertion of M9 in the M1–9 protein as reflected by the formation of 100% Endo H-sensitive, glycosylated forms (Fig. 2 B, lanes 3 and 4), compared with about 60% in the wild type M1–9 (lanes 1 and 2). The addition of M10 (M1–10 E962L/E963L/T964L) completely inhibited glycosylation (lanes 5 and 6), indicating that M10 acts as an efficient and independent ST sequence. Thus, the limited membrane insertion properties of M9 are in part determined by the presence of negatively charged residues. In M7, replacement with Pro of a positively charged residue (Arg850) adjacent to the N-terminal, cytoplasmic part of the membrane segment did not change the partial membrane insertion of M7 in the M1–7el protein (Fig. 2 C, lanes 1–4). On the other hand, substitution with Leu of Gly867 (lanes 5 and 6) significantly increased glycosylation of M1–7el and substitution of Gly860 and Gly867 (lanes 7 and 8) or Gln858 and Gln863 (lanes 9 and 10) rendered the total M1–7el population Endo H-sensitive and glycosylated.

We found that c-Fos was degraded when WEHI7.2 mouse lymphoma cells were induced to undergo apoptosis with the calcium ATPase inhibitor, thapsigargin, or the glucocorticoid hormone, dexamethasone.

Stable transfection of WEHI7.2 cells with a mutant form of c-Fos that was not degraded by the proteasome inhibited apoptosis. Also, overexpression of Bcl-2 in WEHI7.2 cells blocked c-Fos degradation and inhibited apoptosis. The results indicate that proteasome-mediated degradation of c-Fos is an early, Bcl-2-regulated step in apoptosis induction by thapsigargin and dexamethasone.

E64d ((2s,3s)-trans-epoxy succinyl-l-leucylamido-3-methylL-butaneethyl-estero) was purchased from Sigma. Stock solutions of these reagents were prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide and stored in aliquots at −80 °C, except for lactacystin, which was dissolved in water. DX was purchased from Sigma, and TG was purchased from LC Laboratories. Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (BioWhittaker) supplemented with 2 mm glutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, 0.4 mm nonessential amino acids, and 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated horse serum (Hyclone) at 37 °C in a 7% CO2 atmosphere. l-Glutamine, antibiotics, and nonessential amino acids were from Life Technologies, Inc. TG was added to cells from a stock solution in Me2SO to give a final concentration of 100 nm. DX was added to cells from a stock solution in ethanol to give a final concentration of 1 μm. Viable cells, defined as cells that exclude trypan blue dye, were counted using a hemocytometer. The percentage of cells with an apoptotic nuclear morphology was assessed by fluorescence microscopy after staining with eithidium bromide and acridine orange (33Distelhorst C.W. McCormick T.S. Cell Calcium. 1996; 19: 473-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The c-fos cDNA was removed from the pEMSV-fos plasmid (provided by Michael Simonson, Case Western Reserve University) by digestion withEcoRI and ligated in sense orientation into the pcDNA-3 expression vector (Invitrogen) downstream of the cytomegalovirus promotor, producing a pcDNA-3-sense-fos vector. The orientation of inserts was confirmed by analysis with four groups of restriction enzymes. The c-fosΔC cDNA was cloned by polymerase chain reaction using the 5′ primer sequence AAAGGGGAATTCATGTACCCATACGACGTCCCAGACTACGCTATGTTCTCGGGTTTCAACGCGGAC and the 3′ primer sequence ACAGTGGAATTCTTATTATTTCGGTGGGCAGCTGCGCAGCTA. The c-fosΔC cDNA was cloned into the pcDNA-3 expression vector in the sense orientation, confirmed by DNA sequencing. The empty pcDNA-3 vector and the pcDNA-3-fosΔC vectors were transfected into WEHI7.2 cells by electroporation and selected with G418 (1 mg/ml). Findings were confirmed in experiments in which the c-fos cDNA was cloned in sense orientation in the pSFFV-neo expression vector. To recover c-Fos, cells were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline, resuspended in a 5-fold volume of modified RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 1 mmEDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 1 mm NaVO4, 5 mm NaF, 20 mm N-ethylmaleimide, 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 1 mg/ml leupeptin, 1 mg/ml aprotinin), and boiled immediately for 10 min. To recover caspase-3, cells were lysed in a buffer containing 10 mmHEPES/KOH, pH 7.4, 2 mm EDTA, 0.1% CHAPS, 5 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 10 mg/ml pepstatin A, 1 mg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mg/ml aprotinin. The cell lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min. The protein concentration of supernatant samples was determined by the Bio-Rad protein assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories). 70 μg of each protein lysate was separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing and denaturing conditions and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore Co.). Equal loading of protein lysates was confirmed by staining membranes with Ponseau S or staining gels with Coomassie Blue after protein transfer. Membranes were incubated in 5% nonfat dry milk in T-TBS (18 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 122 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) at room temperature for 2 h and then incubated with the primary antibodies (anti-c-Fos at 1:5000 dilution or anti-caspase-3 at 1:4000 dilution) at 4 °C overnight. Membranes were then incubated for 1 h at room temperature with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Life Technologies, Inc.) at a 1:2000 dilution. Immune complexes were detected with the ECL Western blotting detection reagent (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's protocol, followed by exposure to x-ray film (Sigma). Cells were lysed in 0.25 ml of lysis buffer (100 mm HEPES, 10% sucrose, 0.1% CHAPS, 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 10 mmdithiothreitol (DEVD-AMC fluorogenic assay only), 100 μmpepstatin, 100 μm leupeptin, 1 mm EDTA at pH 7.5), followed by a 30-min incubation on ice. Lysis was completed by two 10-s sonication pulses (Sonicator XL, Heat Systems, Farmingdale, NY). Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation, and the cytosolic extract was stored at −20 °C. Protein content of the lysates was determined by the Bio-Rad Protein assay according to the manufacturer's instructions. 20 μg of cytosolic protein and 50 μm DEVD-AMC (Biomol Research Laboratory, Plymouth Meeting, PA) were incubated in a total volume of 500 μl in 100 mm HEPES, 10% sucrose, 0.1% CHAPS, pH 6.8, for 30 min on an orbital shaker at 37 °C. Samples were diluted with lysis buffer to a final volume of 1 ml immediately before measurement of fluorescence by fluorospectrophotometry (Perkin-Elmer LS-3; excitation, 380 nm; emission, 480 nm; slit width, 5.0 nm). Standards containing 0–5000 pmol of AMC were used to determine the amount of fluorochrome released. Measurements were recorded over the linear range of the assay. Bovine serum albumin (50 μg) served as negative control. Cells were pretreated with inhibitors for time periods described in the text at the following concentrations: MG132, 25 μm; lactacystin, 10 μm; ALLN, 50 μm; ALLM, 50 μm; benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp(O-methyl)-fluoromethylketone, 50 μm; E64d, 10 μm. The level of c-Fos was measured by Western blotting in wild type WEHI7.2 cells, which lack Bcl-2, and in stable transfectants, W.Hb12, which were derived from WEHI7.2 cells and express a high level of Bcl-2 (32Lam M. Dubyak G. Chen L. Nuñez G. Miesfeld R.L. Distelhorst C.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6569-6573Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar). Findings were confirmed in replicate experiments using vector only control transfectants, WEHI7.2-neo, and another clone that stably expresses a high level of Bcl-2, W.Hb15 (not shown). The basal level of c-Fos, before treatment with either TG or DX, was 4.6 ± 2.1-fold (mean ± S.E.) higher in W.Hb12 cells than in WEHI7.2 cells (Fig. 1 A). After adding 100 nm TG to WEHI7.2 cells, the level of 66-kDa c-Fos declined markedly, giving rise to a 46-kDa fragment (Fig. 1 A), which in many experiments was further degraded to smaller size fragments. In contrast, the level of c-Fos was stable following TG treatment in W.Hb12 cells (Fig. 1 A). A decline in c-Fos level was also induced when WEHI7.2 cells were treated with 1 μm DX, although the appearance of the 46-kDa fragment was more variable than in TG-treated cells, perhaps due to the longer time course of DX-induced cell death (Fig. 2 A). In contrast, c-Fos was stable when W.Hb12 cells were treated with DX (Fig. 2 A). In the case of both TG- and DX-treated WEHI7.2 cells, the decline in c-Fos preceded caspase-3 (CPP32, apopain, and Yama) activation, detected both by generation of a p17 caspase-3 activation fragment (Figs. 1 B and 2 B) and by cleavage of a synthetic tetrapeptide substrate, DEVD-AMC (Figs. 1 C and 2 C). Furthermore, the decline in c-Fos preceded apoptotic nuclear chromatin condensation detected by fluorescence microscopy (Figs. 1 D and 2 D). Consistent with its known antiapoptotic action, Bcl-2 inhibited both caspase-3 activation (Figs. 1, B and C, and 2, B and C) and nuclear chromatin condensation (Figs. 1 D and 2 D). Thus, both TG and DX induced a marked decline in the level of c-Fos, detected during the early phase of apoptosis and inhibited by Bcl-2.Figure 2Degradation of c-Fos in DX-treated cells. A, Western blot of c-Fos in protein extracts from DX-treated cells.

The decline in c-Fos and the appearance of the 46-kDa c-Fos fragment were inhibited by pretreating cells with the specific proteasome inhibitors, lactacystin and MG132 (N-carbobenzoxyl-l-leucinyl-l-leucinyl) (34Palombella V.J. Rando O.J. Goldberg A.L. Maniatis T. Cell. 1994; 78: 773-785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1915) Google Scholar, 35Fenteany G. Standaert R.F. Lane W.S. Chois S. Corey E.J. Schreiber S.L. Science. 1995; 268: 726-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (1496) Google Scholar) and also by the less specific proteasome inhibitor, ALLN (36Rock K.L. Gramm C. Rothstein L. Clark K. Stein R. Dick L. Hwang D. Goldberg A.L. Cell. 1994; 78: 761-771Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2186) Google Scholar). ALLN also exhibits significant inhibitory activity for the cysteine protease calpain (36Rock K.L. Gramm C. Rothstein L. Clark K. Stein R. Dick L. Hwang D. Goldberg A.L. Cell. 1994; 78: 761-771Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2186) Google Scholar). Although c-Fos is subject to degradation by calpain (37Carillo S. Pariat M. Steff A.-M. Roux P. Etienne-Julan M. Lorca T. Piechaczyk M. Oncogene. 1989; 9: 1079-1089Google Scholar), it is unlikely that calpain played a significant role, because c-Fos degradation was not prevented by the calpain inhibitors, ALLM and E64d (36Rock K.L. Gramm C. Rothstein L. Clark K. Stein R. Dick L. Hwang D. Goldberg A.L. Cell. 1994; 78: 761-771Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2186) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3 A). Pretreatment with benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp(O-methyl)-fluoromethylketone, a cell permeant inhibitor of the caspase family of cysteine proteases (38Zhu H. Fearnhead H.O. Cohen G.M. FEBS Lett. 1995; 374: 303-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), did not inhibit c-Fos degradation (Fig. 3 A), indicating that proteasome-mediated degradation of c-Fos is not secondary to caspase activation. The decline in c-Fos observed in DX-treated WEHI7.2 cells was also due to proteasome-mediated degradation, based on evidence that c-Fos was stabilized by pretreatment with the proteasome inhibitors lactacystin, MG132, and ALLN (Fig. 3 B) and not by E64d (not shown). In DX-treated WEHI7.2 cells, pretreatment with proteasome inhibitors stabilized 46–48 kDa degradation intermediates as well as intact c-Fos (Fig. 3 B). Also, several higher molecular mass forms were detected in DX-treated cells in the presence of proteasome inhibitors (Fig. 3 B). The appearance of both degradation intermediates and presumably polyubiquitinated high molecular weight forms in the presence of proteasome inhibitors has been reported previously in the case of other proteasome target proteins (39Ward C.L. Omura S. Kopito R.R. Cell. 1995; 83: 121-127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1129) Google Scholar, 40Wiertz E.J.H.J. Jones T.R. Sun L. Bogyo M. Geuze H.J. Ploegh H.L. Cell. 1996; 84: 769-779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (912) Google Scholar). In view of the preceding findings suggesting a correlation between proteasome-mediated c-Fos degradation and apoptosis in WEHI7.2 cells, we wished to test whether c-Fos degradation by the proteasome contributes to apoptosis induction. It was not possible to answer this question with the use of proteasome inhibitors, because treatment of WEHI7.2 cells with lactacystin and MG132 induces apoptosis. 2H. He and C. W. Distelhorst, unpublished data. Therefore, as an alternative approach, WEHI7.2 cells were stably transfected with either a cDNA encoding wild type c-Fos or a cDNA encoding a truncated version of c-Fos, c-FosΔC, missing 21 C-terminal amino acids. This strategy was based on evidence that deletion of the C-terminal sequence stabilizes c-Fos by reducing proteasome-mediated degradation (23Tsurumi C. Ishida N. Tamura T. Kakizuka A. Nishida E. Okumura E. Kishimoto T. Inagaki M. Okazaki K. Sagata N. Ichihara A. Tanaka K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5682-5687Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Wild type c-Fos was still degraded following TG treatment, even when expressed at levels 2–4-fold higher than the endogenous level (Fig. 4 A), and therefore did not provide protection against apoptosis (Fig. 4 C). In contrast, c-FosΔC was stable for 16–20 h after TG treatment (Fig. 4 A) or DX treatment (Fig. 5 A). In both situations, c-FosΔC expression inhibited the induction of both caspase-3 activation (Figs. 4 B and 5 B) and apoptotic nuclear chromatin condensation (Fig. 4 C and 5 C). The protective effect of c-FosΔC is not associated with alterations in the level of expression of endogenous Bcl-2 (data not shown). In summary, a mutant form of c-Fos that evades degradation by the proteasome inhibits apoptosis induction by both TG and DX. Thus, it appears that inhibiting the degradation of c-Fos prevents apoptosis, suggesting that accelerated degradation of c-Fos contributes to the generation of apoptotic cell death in WEHI7.2 cells.Figure 5Inhibition of DX-induced apoptosis by a stable mutant of c-Fos. A, Western blot of the C-terminal truncation mutant of c-Fos, c-FosΔC, in protein extracts from DX-treated cells. WEHI7.2 cells were transfected with either control empty vector or a vector encoding c-FosΔC, and stable transfectants were selected for resistance to G418. Whole cell extracts were prepared at time intervals after adding 1 μm DX. Western blot analysis was done with anti-c-Fos antibody.

It appears that c-Fos may confer protection against TG- and DX-induced apoptosis that is abrogated by proteasome-mediated degradation and preserved either by expressing a C-terminal truncated version of c-Fos that is not degraded by the proteasome or by overexpressing Bcl-2, which inhibits c-Fos degradation by the proteasome. The concept that c-Fos has an antiapoptotic action is consistent with other recent evidence that c-Fos mediates expression of genes that protect against apoptosis (41Schreiber M. Baumann B. Cotten M. Angel P. Wagner E.F. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5338-5349Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 42Kaina B. Haas S. Kappes H. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 2721-2731PubMed Google Scholar, 43Ivanov V.N.

Haas S. Kappes H. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 2721-2731PubMed Google Scholar). Earlier reports suggested that c-fos may be a mediator of apoptosis, a concept based on evidence that c-fostranscription increases in cells undergoing apoptosis (44Buttyan R. Zakeri Z. Lockshin R. Wolgemuth D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1988; 2: 650-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 45Colotta F. Polentarutti N. Sironi M. Mantovani A. J. Biol.

Nature. 1993; 363: 166-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (739) Google Scholar) and overexpression of a c-Fos-estrogen receptor fusion protein induces apoptosis in colorectal cells (47Preston G.A. Lyon T.T. Yin Y. Lang J.E. Solomon G. Annab L. Srinivasan D.G. Alcorta D.A. Barrett J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 211-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). However, more recent findings in ac-fos −/− knockout mouse indicate that c-fosinduction is not required for apoptosis (48Roffler-Tarlov S. Brown J.J.G. Tarlov E. Stolarov J. Chapman D.L. Alexiou M. Papaioannou V.E. Development. 1996; 122: 1-9Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, recent findings indicate that light-induced photoreceptor apoptosis is deficient in the c-fos −/− knockout mouse (49Hafezi F. Steinbach J.P. Marti A. Munz K. Wang Z.-Q. Wagner E.F. Aguzzi A. Reme C.E. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 346-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). However, as noted by Hafezi et al., it is unclear whether this is due to a requirement for c-Fos in mediating the cell death process or whether a deficiency of c-Fos throughout development alters the expression of genes required for apoptosis. The findings of the current study suggest that the induction of c-fos transcription observed in cells undergoing apoptosis may be a stress response that is counterbalanced by proteasome-mediated degradation of c-Fos protein. Indeed, this appears to be the case in TG-treated cells where TG treatment induces c-fostranscription (50Qi X.-M. Simonson M. Distelhorst C.W. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2849-2853Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), but newly synthesized c-Fos is rapidly degraded by the proteasome, thus preventing an elevation c-Fos protein. The observation that both TG and DX induce c-Fos degradation indicates that apoptotic signals with diverse mechanisms of action target c-Fos for degradation by the proteasome. It is possible that proteasome-mediated degradation of c-Fos may account for the previously described decline in activator protein-1 activity associated with glucocorticosteroid-induced apoptosis in thymocytes (51Jonat C. Rahmsdorf H.J. Park K.-K. Cata A.C.B. Gebel S. Ponta H. Herrlich P. Cell. 1990; 62: 1189-1204Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1367) Google Scholar, 52Kerppola T.K. Luk D. Curran T. Mol. Cell.

Moreover, accelerated degradation of c-Fos has been described in nitric oxide-mediated neuronal cell death, although the role of the proteasome in mediating c-Fos degradation in this situation has not been tested (54Tabuchi A. Oh E. Taoka A. Sakurai H. Tsuchiya T. Tsuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31061-31067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which apoptotic signals target c-Fos for degradation by the proteasome is unknown. Polyubiquitination targets proteins for degradation by the proteasome (11Goldberg A.L. Rock K.L. Nature. 1992; 357: 375-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar, 12Rechsteiner M. Hoffman L. Dubiel W. J. Biol.

Ubiquitination of c-Fos has been detected both in vitro and in vivo (22Stancovski I. Gonen H. Orian A. Schwartz A.L. Ciechanover A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 7106-7116Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 23Tsurumi C. Ishida N. Tamura T. Kakizuka A. Nishida E. Okumura E. Kishimoto T. Inagaki M. Okazaki K. Sagata N. Ichihara A.

Chem. 1996; 271: 4930-4936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In experiments not shown, c-Fos immunoprecipitates from WEHI7.2 cells were analyzed for evidence of ubiquitination by Western blotting using an anti-ubiquitin antibody. Polyubiquitinated c-Fos was detected at similar levels in cell lysates from TG-treated and untreated WEHI7.2 cells and whether or not Bcl-2 was overexpressed. There are at least two alternative explanations for these preliminary observations. First, TG treatment may have increased the ubiquitination of c-Fos, but rapid degradation of the newly ubiquitinated c-Fos may have prevented its detection in immunoprecipitates. Second, there is evidence that c-Fos may be degraded by the proteasome independent of ubiquitination (56Jariel-Encontre I. Salvat C. Steff A.-M. Pariat M. Acquaviva C. Furstoss O. Piechaczyk M. Mol. Biol. Rep. 1997; 24: 51-56Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); hence, TG may have induced ubiquitin-independent degradation of c-Fos by the proteaseome. Apoptotic signals may generate calcium fluxes, either by increasing the uptake of extracellular calcium or by releasing calcium from intracellular stores. This concept is based in part on the suspected role of calcium in mediating TG- and DX-induced apoptosis, as well as nitric oxide-induced apoptosis (32Lam M. Dubyak G. Chen L. Nuñez G. Miesfeld R.L.

Calcium fluxes might activate kinases or phosphatases that in turn alter the phosphorylation status of c-Fos, thereby targeting c-Fos for destruction by the proteasome. Alternatively, calcium fluxes may activate the proteasome, a concept that is based on evidence that calcium induces assembly of the 26 S proteasome from the 20 S proteasome (60Kawahara H. Yokosawa H.

In the present study, we find that Bcl-2 stabilizes c-Fos against proteasome-mediated degradation and that cells overexpressing Bcl-2 have a higher constitutive level of c-Fos than wild type cells. Thus, the possibility needs to be considered in future studies that by inhibiting proteasome-mediated c-Fos degradation, Bcl-2 may contribute to cellular transformation and tumor progression.

Measurement of noble gases shows that their concentration decreases with decreasing grain size. This effect is attributed to ion implantation. Such an episode could occur in the envelope of a supernova that produced the diamonds, or in interstellar space; in either case, ions with energies above a certain threshold pass completely through the smaller diamond grains without being captured.

The vast majority of eukaryotic integral transmembrane (TM)1 proteins are co-translationally inserted into the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in a signal recognition particle (SRP)-dependent manner. Insertion occurs by lateral translocation of the TM segments from the translocon complex into the lipid bilayer (1Hegde R.S. Lingappa V.R.

TM proteins with single TM segments may be classified according to the initial location of their N terminus and the presence or absence of a cleaved N-terminal signal sequence. Type I TM proteins have a cleaved N-terminal signal sequence followed by a TM anchor (stop transfer) segment, and so they are are initially inserted Ncyt, although the mature N terminus is Nexo. Type II proteins contain an uncleaved signal/anchor sequence resulting in an Ncyt orientation, whereas Type III proteins are unique in being inserted Nexo, so that the native N terminus is translocated to the lumen. TM segments, including uncleaved signal-anchor segments, usually comprise a stretch of 18 or more generally hydrophobic residues, whereas the hydrophobic segment of cleaved signal sequences is distinctly shorter (7–15 residues) and is usually preceded by a short, positively charged N-terminal segment (6von Heijne G. J. Membr. Biol. 1990; 115: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar). The signals determining TM protein insertion orientation have been extensively studied in prokaryotes, primarily by mutational analysis of leader peptidase (7Andersson H. von Heijne G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 683-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 8Nilsson I. von Heijne G. Cell. 1990; 62: 1135-1141Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The primary signal is provided by positively charged residues adjacent to the TM segment; the terminus with adjacent positive charges is normally retained in the cytoplasm, a pattern codified in the “positive inside rule” (9von Heijne G. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 225: 487-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (1402) Google Scholar). A major determinant of this pattern is the prokaryotic negative-inside transmembrane potential (10Andersson H. von Heijne G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2267-2272Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The presence of several positive charges on both sides of a TM segment can prevent insertion, causing “topological frustration” (11Gafvelin G. von Heijne G. Cell. 1994; 77: 401-412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), although it has recently been shown that reducing the anionic phospholipid content of the Escherichia coli cytoplasmic membrane facilitates translocation of positive charges in E. coli (12van Klompenburg W. Nilsson I. von Heijne G. de Kruijff B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4261-4266Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Although the positive inside rule discounts the importance of negatively charged residues (8Nilsson I. von Heijne G. Cell. 1990; 62: 1135-1141Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), negative charges in the short N terminus of the 44-residue phage pf3 coat protein do promote its translocation (13Kiefer D. Hu X.T. Dalbey R. Kuhn A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2197-2204Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Proteins are translocated by several mechanisms in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Some prokaryotic proteins require the Sec pathway defined by sec genes, others do not, and TM segments of the same protein can belong to both groups (7Andersson H. von Heijne G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 683-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Exofacial N termini, as in the pf3 coat protein, belong to the Sec-independent group (14Dalbey R.E. Kuhn A. Heijne G.v.

If the topogenic effects of both transmembrane potential and lipid composition result from purely electrostatic interaction with charges in translocated proteins, these effects may be independent of the translocation mechanism. A minority of proteins in yeast are preferentially translocated at the ER by the SRP-independent post-translational pathway. The known substrates are secreted proteins with signal sequences of unusually low hydrophobicity or Type I TM proteins with weakly hydrophobic N-terminal signal segments, such as Kex2p (15Ng D.T. Brown J.D. Walter P. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 269-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). All other TM proteins, including all of the variants of the model proteins described in this paper, are predicted to be preferentially translocated by the SRP-dependent pathway (15Ng D.T. Brown J.D. Walter P. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 269-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). As for prokaryotes, mechanisms for response to charged topogenic signals in eukaryotes may be independent of the pathway. Although the positive inside pattern also tends to be true for eukaryotic TM proteins of known topology, statistical analysis showed a better correlation with the charge difference across a TM segment, calculated for an arbitrary window of 15 residues on either side (16Hartmann E. Rapoport T.A. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5786-5790Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar), and a much greater tolerance for translocation of positive charges is apparent. Positive values for Δ(C − N), the difference between C-terminal and N-terminal charges, correlate with Nexo orientation, and negative values correlate with Ncyt orientation. A bias toward Nexo insertion is seen when Δ(C − N) is zero (16Hartmann E. Rapoport T.A. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5786-5790Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). This “charge difference rule” differs from the positive inside rule by giving positive and negative charges equal weight. There is no detectable pH gradient at the ER to respond to this signal. The implied difference in response, therefore, may reflect differences in the mechanisms determining orientation. Results of a limited in vitro analysis of the effects of altering flanking charge on the topology of cytochrome P450, a Type III protein with a very short N-terminal segment, were consistent with this charge difference rule (17Sato T. Sakaguchi M. Mihara K. Omura T. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2391-2397Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), whereas in vivo analyses of the asialoglycoprotein receptor subunit H1 and paramyxovirus hemagluttinin-neuraminidase (HN), both Type II TM proteins, were interpreted as indicating compliance with the positive inside rule, with a dominant effect for N-terminal charge (18Beltzer J.P. Fiedler K. Fuhrer C. Geffen I. Handschin C. Wessels H.P. Spiess M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 973-978Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Parks G.D. Lamb R.A. Cell. 1991; 64: 777-787Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 20Parks G.D. Lamb R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19101-19109Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, however, it has become apparent that Type II proteins with N termini of significant length may be poor models for tests of topogenic signals because, even in co-translational translocation, there are no necessary constraints on folding in this N-terminal segment prior to engagement of the first TM segment with the SRP complex. Stable folding can be a strong impediment to reversal of orientation, providing an Ncyt bias, as shown for variants of the asialoglycoprotein receptor (21Denzer A.J. Nabholz C.E. Spiess M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 6311-6317Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In contrast, cytoplasmic folding stability in the N-terminal segment of a Type III protein must be constrained to allow its subsequent translocation; use of such a protein in analysis of topogenic signals should avoid the bias inherent in many Type II proteins. G protein-coupled receptors have an exofacial (Nexo) N terminus and seven TM segments, so that ER insertion of their first TM segment is topologically equivalent to insertion of a Type III protein. This is true however, only if the N-terminal segment is less than about 100 residues. Above this size limit, an N-terminal signal is employed and insertion is analogous to that of a Type I protein (22Wallin E. von Heijne G. Protein Eng. 1995; 8: 693-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). We have constructed model fusion proteins (see Fig. 1) based on N-terminal fragments of Ste2p, the yeast G protein-coupled α-factor pheromone receptor, which has typical topology and an Nexo 51-residue N terminus (23Cartwright C.P. Tipper D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2620-2628Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The effects of alterations in flanking charge on insertion orientation of the first TM segment (TM1) of Ste2p in these fusions was found to be entirely consistent with the charge difference rule (24Harley C.A. Tipper D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24625-24633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Although these results indicated that N-terminal negative charges provide strong topogenic signals, the relative strength of positive and negative charges was not determined, and their effectiveness in N- and C-terminal location, relative to the TM segment, was not compared. We have now compared the topogenic effects of small N- and C-terminal positive and negative charges, the first such analysis in any model system. An improved assay procedure increases the precision of our in vivo orientation analysis. Precise equivalence of charges, independent of polarity and location,i.e. strict compliance with the charge difference rule, was demonstrated. Earlier data also indicated that our model fusion proteins had a charge-independent bias toward Nexo insertion of about 3:1 in the absence of any charge difference (24Harley C.A. Tipper D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24625-24633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Current data confirm this bias and indicate that neither the 51-residue N-terminal segment nor the C-terminal reporter affect this charge-independent bias, the cause of which, therefore, probably lies in the TM segment itself. In vitro studies of a TM protein with a very short N-terminal domain and an oligoleucine TM segment showed that a longer TM segment favors Nexoinsertion, whereas a short segment favors Ncyt insertion (25Sakaguchi M. Tomiyoshi R. Kuroiwa T. Mihara K. Omura T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 16-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). In a mutant H1 receptor subunit in which the N-terminal domain was reduced to 4 residues, but in which the −3 charge difference and the normal Ncyt orientation were retained (18Beltzer J.P. Fiedler K. Fuhrer C. Geffen I. Handschin C. Wessels H.P. Spiess M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 973-978Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), orientation was normal when the TM segment was replaced by 7–16 leucines but was partially reversed when this was increased to 19 or more leucines (26Wahlberg J.M. Spiess M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 555-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). With a charge difference of −2, topology remained predominantly Ncyt with 7–13 leucines but was almost completely reversed in constructs with 19–25 leucines (26Wahlberg J.M. Spiess M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 555-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Topogenic effects of TM segment length, therefore, can override a small charge difference signal. No studies have been reported in the absence of a charged topogenic signal or that distinguish effects of length from those of total hydrophobicity. We have now shown that TM segment hydrophobicity (rather than length) is largely responsible for the observed charge-independent bias in orientation of our model Type III proteins and have deduced an estimate of relative signal strengths. We also find that the distribution (gradient) of hydrophobicity within the TM segment is a previously unidentified and significant determinant of orientation that could not have been detected in analyses of homopolymeric TM segments (25Sakaguchi M. Tomiyoshi R. Kuroiwa T. Mihara K. Omura T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 16-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 26Wahlberg J.M. Spiess M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 555-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The consequences for topology prediction are discussed. All DNA manipulations were performed using the E. coli strain DH5α (supE44D lacU169(f80 lacZDM15) hsdR17 recA1 endA1 gyrA96 thi-1 relA1). Most fusion proteins were expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiaestrain CRY2A, a derivative of strain CRY2 (MATα ura3–1 leu2–3,112 trp1–1 his3–11 ade2 can1–100) (27Komano H. Fuller R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10752-10756Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), in which ER-KEX2 (28Chaudhuri B. Stephan C. FEBS Lett. 1992; 304: 41-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), under control of the PGK promoter, is integrated at his3–11. Many strains were also expressed in the isogenic MATa strain CRY1 (27Komano H. Fuller R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10752-10756Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) grown under Leu selection to ensure retention of the episomal YEp(LEU2)ER-KEX2 plasmid (28Chaudhuri B. Stephan C. FEBS Lett. 1992; 304: 41-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), in which ER-KEX2 is expressed from the KEX2 promoter. Cell fractionation, β-lactamase activity assays, and Western blots using anti-β-lactamase sera or antisera to the Ste2p N terminus were performed as described previously (24Harley C.A. Tipper D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24625-24633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Insertion orientation, expressed as %Ncyt, was deduced from β-lactamase activity distribution in strain CRY2A, whereA sec = the fraction of total activity secreted and A ca = the fraction cell-associated (A sec + A ca = 1), using the formula %Ncyt = 100(A sec/0.85)/2(A ca − 0.15A sec). This is based on half-lives of 4 and 8 h for A ca and A secactivities, respectively, and the observation that 15% of secreted activity is cell-associated by virtue of being bound to the cell wall or in transit (see under “Results”). This is a revised form of the formula previously used (24Harley C.A. Tipper D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24625-24633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) incorporating significantly smaller correction factors. Antibody to Ost1p was kindly provided by Dr. Reid Gilmore. Constructs S79g-PB and S42-l, m, n, o, p, q, r, and s have been previously described (24Harley C.A. Tipper D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24625-24633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and are renamed as constructs 5, 6, 10, 20, 4, 9, 23, 24, and 27, respectively. The Ste2p fragments in all S42 and S79 constructs are bounded by N-terminal XhoI and C-terminal PstI sites and contain an NdeI site near the center of TM1. The interchangeable P or α fragments of the reporter are bounded by PstI and MscI sites. (24Harley C.A. Tipper D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24625-24633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). All of these sites and a vectorAatII site are unique and were used to interchange these fragments in many of the constructs described here. The sequences of all products were confirmed. All new constructs were derived from S42h-PB (24Harley C.A. Tipper D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24625-24633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), used as template in a PCR with the N-terminal primer 5′-GGGCTCGAGAATGAACRACCAGTTGCAAGGTTTAGTTAAC (where R = A or G) and C-terminal primer 5′-GAGTATGGCTGCAGTCGG, producing a mixed pool of 120-bp products. These were cut with XhoI + PstI (sites underlined) and cloned into a YEp-LEU2 derivative of S79a-PB (24Harley C.A. Tipper D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24625-24633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) also cut with XhoI + PstI, producing S42-PB construct 1. In all S42 fusions, the Ste2p TM1 segment is preceded by a 15-residue N-terminal sequence that varies only in residues 2–4; in construct 1, residues 1–4 are MNNQ. In all fusions, the segment 3–6 residues downstream of TM1 comprises the variable C-terminal component. In construct 1, this sequence is RTRK. Construct 1 was cut with NdeI + AatII and the 4146-bp fragment containing LEU2 and the Ste2p N-terminal sequence was ligated to a 2905-bp NdeI + AatIIfragment derived from S79b-αB (24Harley C.A. Tipper D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24625-24633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The product, S42-αB construct 21, has the N-terminal MNNQ sequence and the C-terminal TTTT sequence. The 4146-bp NdeI + AatII fragment from construct 21 containing the Ste2p N-terminal MNNQ sequence and theLEU2 marker was ligated with the 2905-bp NdeI +AatII fragment from S79f-PB (24Harley C.A. Tipper D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24625-24633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) encoding the C-terminal sequence TTRT producing S42-αB construct 11. Construct 21 was used as a template, with the N-terminal degenerate primer 5′-GGGCTCGAGAATGAACRACCAGTTGCAAGGTTTAGTTAAC (where R = A or G) and the C-terminal primer 5′-GGGCTGCAGTCGGGTCTGTTGTGCTTGTCGATGTC to generate a mixed pool of ∼120-bp PCR products, which were cut with XhoI +PstI and recloned into the corresponding sites of construct 21. Sequence analysis identified construct 28 in which the C-terminal amino acid sequence has been mutated to TTTD. Primers 5′-GGGCTGCAGTCGGGTCTGTTGTGCTTGTCGATGTC and 5′-GGGCTCGAGAATGAACGACCAGTTGCAAGGTTTAGTTAAC were used in a PCR with construct 28 as a template to produce a 120-bp product. This was cut with XhoI + PstI and cloned into construct 28. The resultant constructs 25 and 26 have the MNDD N-terminal and TTTD C-terminal sequences. Constructs 11 and 25 were cut with NdeI + AatII. The 4146-bp fragment from 25 encoding the N-terminal sequence MNDQ was ligated to the 2905-bp fragment from 11 encoding a C-terminal TTRT fragment, resulting in constructs 7 and 8. Constructs 13 and 14, 2, 3, and 15 were made using a similar strategy; the N/C-terminal sequences flanking the Ste2p TM1 segment are MNDQ/TTTT, MNDQ/TTRK, MDNE/TTRT, and MDNE/TTDT, respectively. The N-terminal primer 5′-GGGCTCGAGCATGAACCAGTTGCAAGGTTTAGTTAACACTAGTGTTACTCAGGCCATTATG and the C-terminal primer 5′-GGGCTGCAGTCGTTGTTGTGCTTGTCGACGACATCCACATGACATTC were used with construct 21 as template to produce a 120-bp product, which was cloned as a XhoI to PstI fragment into construct 21 producing construct 22. The sequence at theXhoI site is modified such that the neutral SSS tripeptide is in frame with the downstream initiator M residue. S79g-PB was used as a template for PCR using primers 5′-GGGCTCGAGAATGRATCCAACGTATAATCCTGG and 5′-GGGGTCGACGAAGTGATGGTAGATCCATTC (where R = A or G). The 94-bp PCR products were digested with XhoI +SalI and cloned into construct 22 digested withXhoI. Constructs 16 and 17, which encode S72 derivatives of Ste2p with extended N-terminal sequences (Fig. 1), were identified by sequence analysis. The complementary oligonucleotides 5′-TCGAGAATGRATCCAACGTATAATCCTGGTACCAGCACCATTAACTACCAGTCG and 5′-TCGACGACTGGTAGTTAATGGTGCTGGTACCAGGATTATACGTTGGATYCATTC (where R = A or G and Y = T or C) were annealed to generate XhoI and SalI sticky ends. This linker was ligated into construct 22 cut with XhoI. The resultant constructs, 18 and 19, encode S60 Ste2p derivatives with an extended neutral non-glycosylated N terminus (Fig. 1). All TM1 domain derivatives are based on the S60-n20 construct 18. The 20-residue TM1 segment of Ste2p encoded by S60-n20 was initially truncated by cutting construct 18 with SpeI +NdeI and ligation with linkers produced by annealing oligonucleotide pairs 5′-CTAGTACTCAGAGCA + 5′-TATGCTCTGAGTA and 5′-CTAGTACTTTCGGTGTCA + 5′-TATGACACCGAAAGTA. The resultant constructs, S60-n14 and S60-n17, respectively, were initially identified by the presence of an additional ScaI site. S60-n20 was cut with SpeI + SalI and ligated with the linker formed by annealing oligonucleotides 5′-CTAGTCTGCTAGCTTTGACTTTGATTGTCATGTGGATGTCG and 5′-TCGACGACATCCACATGACAATCAAAGTCAAAGCTAGCAGA. The product, S60-n11, was initially identified by its uniqueNheI site (underlined). Leucine residues were added to the N terminus of the TM1 segment in S60-n11 by cutting withSpeI + NheI and ligating with linkers produced by annealing oligonucleotide pairs 5′-CTAGTACTCTGTTGCTACTG + 5′-CTAGCAGTAGCAACAGAGTA and 5′-CTAGTACTCTCCTACTGTTGCTACTG + 5′-CTAGCAGTAGCAACAGTAGGAGAGTA. The resultant plasmids are S60-L3-n11 and S60-L5-n11, respectively. To move the L5 peptide from the N terminus to the C terminus of S60-n11, S60-n11 was used as template in a PCR with the primers 5′-TCGAGAATGGATCCAACG and 5′-GGGGTCGACAGGAGTAGGAGCAGCATCCACATGACAATCAAAG. The resultant product was digested with BamHI + SalI and ligated into the corresponding sites of S60-n20, producing S60-n11-L5. The oligonucleotides 5′-GGGACTAGTGTTACTCAGATCGCAATCATCTTACTTTTA and 5′-GGGGTCGACGTCATACTATATGCCAGGGC were used in a PCR to produce a 90-bp product encoding the TM1 segment from NDV HN (29Wilson C. Gilmore R. Morrison T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 449-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). This PCR product was cut with SpeI +SalI and ligated into the corresponding sites of S60-n20, producing S60-HN. Reversal of the HN TM segment was achieved by ligating the same S60-n20 fragment with the SpeI toSalI linker produced by annealing and ligating two oligonucleotides pairs, 5′-CTAGTGTTACTCAGATGAGCTACGCCCTGGCCGCCGCCT + 5′-GGCGATGGAGGCGGCGGCCAGGGCGTAGCTCATCTGAGTAACA and 5′-CCATCGCCTTGACCATGGTTACTCTGCTGCTGATCGCCATCACG + 5′-CCATCGCCTTGACCATGGTTACTCTGCTGCTGATCGCCATCACG. The product is S60-HNrev. S79-PB is a chimeric model Type III TM protein (Fig. 1), the derivatives of which, expressed from the PGKpromoter on multicopy YEp plasmids, have previously been used to analyze topogenic signals determining insertion orientation in S. cerevisiae (24Harley C.A. Tipper D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24625-24633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). S79 is the N-terminal 79 residues of Ste2p, including the 51-residue exofacial N-terminal segment, the 20-residue TM1, and the 8-residue first cytoplasmic loop (Fig. 1). It is fused at its C terminus to PB or αB, reporters of insertion orientation. P is a 59-residue fragment of the precursor of secreted K1 killer toxin (Fig. 1) (30Cartwright C.P. Li Y. Zhu Y.S. Kang Y.S. Tipper D.J. Yeast. 1994; 10: 497-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), including two sites efficiently cleaved by Kex2p, a TM protease, the activity of which is normally limited to the lumen of the trans-Golgi (31Redding K. Holcomb C. Fuller R.S. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 527-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). B is the mature form of β-lactamase encoded by the E. coli bla gene. β-Lactamase is fully active in yeast in cytoplasmic fusions, in cell-associated TM fusions, or when secreted (30Cartwright C.P. Li Y. Zhu Y.S. Kang Y.S. Tipper D.J. Yeast. 1994; 10: 497-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In αB, P is replaced by α, a 31-residue fragment of prepro-α-factor that also includes a site efficiently cleaved by Kex2p (Fig. 1) (24Harley C.A. Tipper D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24625-24633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In principle, therefore, orientation of Ste2p-β-lactamase fusions can be deduced from the ratio of cell-associated activity, due to intact fusions inserted Nexo and secreted activity due to fusions inserted Ncyt and processed by Kex2p. Cell-associated materials are also routinely monitored for membrane insertion and N-glycosylation by Western blot of membrane fractions, using anti-β-lactamase antibody. If fusions have the predicted size, behave as integral membrane proteins, and have the predicted patterns of N-glycosylation (Fig. 1), this provides independent evidence of insertion orientation (24Harley C.A. Tipper D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24625-24633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Processing of Ncyt fusions by Kex2p normally requires their transport from the ER to the trans-Golgi. Because exit of abnormal TM proteins from the ER may be delayed, we previously expressed all fusions in cells of yeast MATa strain CRY1 in which additional Kex2p is supplied in the form of ER-Kex2p. ER-Kex2p is a soluble, secreted form of the protease in which the C-terminal TM domain is replaced by an ER retention signal (HDEL). When expressed in strain CRY1 from the weak KEX2 promoter on a multicopy episomal plasmid (28Chaudhuri B. Stephan C. FEBS Lett. 1992; 304: 41-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), β-lactamase secretion efficiencies were not affected for any fusion protein (24Harley C.A. Tipper D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24625-24633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). However, this level of ER-Kex2p expression failed to restore expression of α-factor in akex2-null mutant of strain CRY2, a MATα strain isogenic to CRY1 (27Komano H. Fuller R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10752-10756Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). We therefore constructed strain CRY2A in which the ER-KEX2 gene, expressed from the PGK promoter (at least 100-fold stronger than the KEX2 promoter (32Nacken V. Achstetter T. Degryse E. Gene. 1996; 175: 253-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar)), is integrated at the his3–1 locus of strain CRY2. Normal α-factor secretion was restored in the isogenic kex2-null strain. 2C. A. Harley and D. J. Tipper, unpublished observations. Expression of secreted β-lactamase from most fusion constructs was slightly increased in strain CRY2A, whereas secretion from a few was more significantly enhanced, implying inefficient translocation to the trans-Golgi.

It is RPP0, encoding the essential protein of the large ribosomal subunit stalk rpP0. Resistant mutants are found to retain most of the binding capacity for the drug, indicating that mutations in rpP0 endow the ribosome with the capacity to perform translation elongation in the presence of the inhibitor. Other proteins of the ribosomal stalk influence the expression of resistance, pointing to a wealth of interactions between stalk components and elongation factors. The involvement of multiple elements of the translation machinery in the mode of action of sordarin antifungals may explain the large selectivity of these compounds, even though the individual target components are highly conserved proteins.

The ribosomal stalk is a defined morphological feature most evident in prokaryotic ribosomes, where it is composed of the L7/L12 tetramer, L10 and L11 proteins, and a highly conserved domain of the 23 S rRNA termed the “GTPase center.” The stalk plays a prominent role in the elongation phase of ribosomal protein synthesis (see Refs. 1Liljas A.

None of the P1/P2 proteins are absolutely essential for growth, although in the absence of at least one member of each class (P1 and P2), vegetative growth is strongly retarded (12Remacha M.

The gene encodes the ribosomal stalk protein rpP0. It is further shown that other stalk components are also involved in the translation elongation function inhibited by GM193663, substantiating the ribosomal requirement for binding of the inhibitor to EF2 and pointing at interactions between the factor and specific stalk components. All the strains used in this study are derivatives of: S. cerevisiae SEY6210 (Mat α ura3–52 leu2–3, 112 his3Δ200 trp1Δ901 lys2–81 suc2Δ9), its ade2–101 derivative SEY6211 (S.

Heterologous rpP0 proteins were expressed in the W303dGP0 strain growing in glucose, to repress the chromosomalRPP0 gene, using the centromeric plasmid pFL39-HIS and the endogenous S. cerevisiae promoter. All W303 derivatives and pFL constructs were obtained from the laboratory of J. P. G. Ballesta (12Remacha M. Santos C. Bermejo B. Naranda T. Ballesta J.P. J. Biol.

YPD (0.67% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, 2% glucose, and auxotrophic supplements as required) and SD (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% glucose) media, methods for genetics crosses, sporulation of diploids, and dissection of asci have been described previously (20Guthrie C. Fink G.R. Guide to Yeast Genetics and Molecular Biology. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA1991Google Scholar). Yeast transformations were done by the lithium acetate procedure (21Ito H. Fukuda Y. Murata K. Kimura A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 163-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Spontaneous resistant mutants were selected on YPD medium plates with 100 μg/ml sordarin derivative GM193663.1 P-protein gene disruptions on strains 6210, FPR1–19, and FPR2–15 were carried out according to standard procedures by allele replacement, using different constructions for genes rpp1a, rpp1b, rpp2a, and rpp2b, all obtained from the laboratory of J. P. G. Ballesta (12Remacha M. Santos C. Bermejo B. Naranda T. Ballesta J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12061-12067Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Gene disruptions were checked by PCR3 or Southern blots (data not shown). Growth inhibitory activity of GM193663 was determined on liquid medium by the antibiotic 2-fold serial dilution technique; 100 μl of YPD were inoculated with 105 colony-forming units/well. IC50 was defined as the minimal concentration of compound that inhibited 50% of the control growth after 24 h of incubation at 30 °C. For strains living with heterologous rpP0proteins, A 600 was measured after 48 h of incubation because of their slower growth. Cycloheximide (Sigma) and GM193663 stocks were prepared in Me2SO. Cell-free S50 extracts were prepared from cells grown in YPD medium to an A 600 = 1.5. Washed cells were broken in lysis buffer (30 mm Hepes/KOH, 100 mm potassium acetate, 12.5 mm magnesium acetate, 2 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 8.5%d-mannitol, pH = 7.4) by vortexing with glass beads for 10 1-min periods, with intervening 1-min cooling in ice. Unbroken cells and debris were pelleted at 4,000 × g for 10 min, and the S50 supernatant was obtained by centrifugation at 50,000 × g for 30 min. [3H]Sordarin was labeled at 180 GBq/mmol in the aldehyde group by the Isotope Chemistry Group at Glaxo Wellcome (Stevenage, United Kingdom). Binding assays were performed with 0.5 mg of protein from S50 extracts and 0.1 μg of [3H]sordarin (36 kBq, 20 nmol), in 80 mm Hepes/KOH, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 10 mm magnesium acetate, in a final volume of 500 μl. This amount of sordarin was enough to have at least 90% of the input compound free at equilibrium. After 30 min of incubation at room temperature, 400 μl from each sample were applied to PD-10 Sephadex-G 25 M columns (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), presoaked in lysis buffer without d-mannitol. [3H]Sordarin bound to excluded macromolecules was measured by scintillation counting. All incubations were done in duplicate tubes and the results averaged. Measurements from paired tubes never differed by more than 20%. Counts obtained in parallel incubations containing a 100-fold excess of cold sordarin were subtracted from all data points. This nonspecific binding was always less than 10% of the total binding detected. Localization of mutations that conferred resistance to GM193663 within the rpP0 open reading frame was carried out by the single strand conformation polymorphism technique (22Orita M. Iwahana H. Kanazawa H. Hayashi K. Sekiya T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 2766-2770Crossref PubMed Scopus (3390) Google Scholar). Briefly, standard PCRs were performed using cloned rpP0 from all mutant and wild type strains as template. Three overlapping fragments covering the entire open reading frame were amplified and electrophoresed under denaturing conditions. PCR fragments showing an altered mobility compared with their corresponding wild types were sequenced using an Applied Biosystems PRISM 310 genetic analyzer. It has been communicated previously that genetic analysis of spontaneous mutants resistant to the sordarin antifungal GM193663, an inhibitor of translation elongation, identified two different genetic complementation groups, denominatedFPR1 and FPR2.1 The major one,FPR1, grouped mutations in EFT2, encoding translation elongation factor 2. FPR2 was composed of just four mutants and, contrary to expectations, did not arise fromEFT1, the second EF2-coding gene in S. cerevisiae. Growth and resistance characteristics of the mutants in rich medium are presented in Table I. All mutants displayed cross-resistance on plates to other members of the sordarin family, but not to the protein synthesis inhibitors cycloheximide, hygromycin, or verrucarin A, showing that sordarins act by a mechanism different from the one used by those other inhibitors.Table IGrowth and resistance levels of GM193663 mutants in different genetic backgroundsStrainMutationt 1/2IC50GM193663Cycloheximideminμg/ml373None1150.010.10 FPR2–6Thr144 → Ala1085.830.10SEY6210None880.010.10 FPR2–10Gln139 → His921.360.20 FPR2–15Thr144 → Ala9316.720.10SEY6211None970.01 FPR2–17Gln139 → His1121.120.20Ala140 → TrpDoubling time in YPD medium at 30 °C.Concentration of inhibitor that reduces growth by 50% compared with the untreated control, determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Open table in a new tab Doubling time in YPD medium at 30 °C. Concentration of inhibitor that reduces growth by 50% compared with the untreated control, determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Protein synthesis in a cell-free extract from an FPR2 mutant also displayed a reduced sensitivity toward GM193663 inhibition,1 thereby ruling out a transport mechanism of resistance. To investigate the identity of the gene mutated in theFPR2 group, an educated guess was made considering that the most likely possibilities were genes encoding macromolecules that functionally interacted with EF2. Candidates included proteins of the large ribosomal subunit stalk, namely rpP0, the acidic P-proteins, and the rpL12 protein (formerly rpL15) located on the GTPase center (6Uchiumi T. Kikuchi M. Terao K. Iwasaki K. Ogata K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 156: 37-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 7Uchiumi T. Traut R.R. Kominami R. J. Biol.

Chem. 1982; 257: 5359-5366Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). rRNA was an unlikely candidate given the semidominant nature of the mutations and the large number of rRNA genes present in the cell. Strains genetically tagged at the loci encoding stalk proteins rpP0, rpP1α, rpP1β, rpP2α, and rpP2β were obtained from the laboratory of J. P. G. Ballesta (12Remacha M. Santos C. Bermejo B. Naranda T. Ballesta J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12061-12067Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and crossed to GM193663R mutant FPR2–15, which displayed the most dominant resistance phenotype. Tetrad analysis did not detect a genetic linkage between the resistance locus and the P-proteins, except in the case of rpP0, where a tight genetic linkage between the resistance mutation and RPP0, the rpP0 locus, was found. All 36 tetrads dissected displayed the parental ditype phenotype. This result strongly suggested that the resistance and RPP0 loci were very close to each other or were the same one. RPP0 was amplified and cloned from the four mutants in group 2 as well as from their corresponding parental strains. The cloned genes were transformed into a sensitive haploid strain, and the transformants were tested for their sensitivity to GM193663. Strains transformed with an RPP0 gene from a resistant strain became resistant themselves in all cases, confirming that the gene mutated in the second complementation group was RPP0. Thus, mutations in protein rpP0, an essential protein of the large ribosomal subunit, can confer a level of resistance to sordarins higher than the one afforded by mutations in EF2, the proposed binding protein for sordarins (Table II). This could be the first such occurrence described, and it strongly suggests that rpP0 and EF2 interact functionally.Table IIEffect of deleting the acidic ribosomal P-proteins on the resistance levels of GM193663 mutantsStrainRibosomal P-protein deletedIC50GM193663Cycloheximideμg/mlFPR2–15None16.720.10FPR2–15P1αrpP1α1.160.06FPR2–15P1βrpP1β12.750.09FPR2–15P2αrpP2α14.560.10FPR2–15P2βrpP2β1.220.06FPR2–15P1αP2βrpP1α, rpP2β0.25FPR2–15P1βP2αrpP1β, rpP2α12.50FPR1–19 (EF2(S523T))None0.50FPR1–19P1αrpP1α0.03FPR1–19P1βrpP1β0.50FPR1–19P2αrpP2α0.50FPR1–19P2βrpP2β0.15Concentration of inhibitor that reduces growth by 50% compared with the untreated control, determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Open table in a new tab Concentration of inhibitor that reduces growth by 50% compared with the untreated control, determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Chromosomal RPP0 genes from the four mutants were cloned by gap repair and analyzed by single-stranded conformational polymorphism (see “Experimental Procedures”). Mobility changes were found in the central one-third of all alleles. The region was sequenced on both strands, and amino acid changes were detected in all mutants (Table I, Fig. 1). To confirm that the observed changes were not introduced by the PCR, genomic fragments from the four mutants were recovered by the plasmid gap repair technique (24Rothstein R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 281-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (1102) Google Scholar). A wild typeRPP0 gene was gapped by removing all the open reading frame except the last 86 amino acids and then transformed into the resistant mutants. Plasmids were recovered from stable transformants, sequenced, and re-transformed into a wild type strain. All recovered plasmids had the expected mutation and conferred resistance to GM193663, establishing that the observed amino acid changes (Table I) were responsible for the resistance to the inhibitor. Unexpectedly, spontaneous mutant FPR2–17 had four nucleotides changed, leading to two consecutive substitutions in the amino acid sequence of the protein. Comparison of the sequence of the rpP0 region, where the GM193663R mutations were found across different phyla (Fig. 1), showed that this domain is a highly conserved one and hence presumably important for the function of rpP0. It is thus somewhat surprising that the mutations do not impede the normal function of the protein, as indicated by the nearly wild type growth rate of the mutant strains in the absence of the inhibitor (Table I). In fact, there seems to be a lot of flexibility in the primary sequence requirements for rpP0 function. The group of J. P. G. Ballesta has shown that the yeast ribosome can function with P0 proteins from different species. 4M. A. Rodrı́guez-Gabriel, M. Remacha, and J. P. G. Ballesta, submitted for publication. Using their strains, we have found that GM193663 has a higher IC50 for growth inhibition in S. cerevisiae cells carrying rpP0 proteins from Dictyostelium or rat than in cells expressing wild type rpP0 (Table III). This confirms that rpP0 plays a role in the mode of action of sordarin compounds and shows that it is at least partly responsible for the selectivity of these inhibitors.Table IIIResistance to GM193663 induced in S. cerevisiae by the expression of heterologous rpP0 proteinsStrainOrigin of expressed rpP0 proteinIC50, GM193663μg/mlW303dGP0S. cerevisiae0.09Dictyostelium discoideum0.80Rattus norvegicus0.25rpP0 proteins were expressed from the pFL39-HIS plasmid as described under “Experimental Procedures.”Concentration of inhibitor that reduces growth by 50% compared with the untreated control, determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Open table in a new tab rpP0 proteins were expressed from the pFL39-HIS plasmid as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Concentration of inhibitor that reduces growth by 50% compared with the untreated control, determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Sordarin is a close analogue of GM193663 (Fig. 2) and both compounds display cross-resistance and compete for binding to macromolecules.2 Fig. 2 shows [3H]sordarin binding to macromolecules in the rpP0 mutants. Substantial binding was found in all mutant strains, showing that growth, and therefore protein synthesis, can take place in the presence of nearly wild type levels of inhibitor binding in some strains. Data from an EF2 mutant have been included for comparison, and it can be seen that in this case resistance is accompanied by the total loss of sordarin binding capacity, as described previously1 (Fig. 2). The measured binding is to the ribosomal fraction of the extracts plus associated cytoplasmic factors, because the post-ribosomal supernatant showed negligible binding (data not shown). Therefore, the mechanism of resistance mediated by the rpP0 protein is different from the simple loss of affinity for the drug, and it may be related to the molecular details of the interaction between EF2 and the ribosomal stalk. Given the known or inferred interactions between the acidic P-proteins and rpP0 (see Ref. 4Ballesta J.P.G. Remacha M. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1996; 55: 157-193Crossref PubMed Google Scholar for a review), it was of interest to know if lack of the former affected resistance due to rpP0, which would substantiate the relevance of the interactions between P-proteins in translation elongation. All four nonessential P-proteins were interrupted singly and in pairs in the FPR2–15 mutant background. It was found that deleting either rpP1α or rpP2β reduced resistance levels more than 10-fold. Deletion of either rpP1β or rpP2α did not have a significant effect. Deleting both rpP1α and rpP2β had an additive effect, whereas deleting the other pair did not affect resistance (Table II). The effect of the protein composition of the ribosomal stalk on the sensitivity toward GM193663 is observed in the mutantRPP0 background only. The same deletions do not affect the sensitivity of a wild type strain (data not shown). These results confirm that the four P-proteins are not functionally equivalent, with rpP1α and rpP2β establishing a type of interaction with rpP0, and probably EF2, different from the one maintained by rpP1β or rpP2α. The influence of the stalk on the sensitivity toward sordarin antifungals seems to be specific for this type of translational inhibitors, because deleting the acidic P-proteins, either on a wild type strain or in the FPR2–15 mutant, did not change their sensitivity toward a different elongation inhibitor, cycloheximide. However, GM193663 resistance mediated by a mutant EF2 was also diminished by deleting rpP1α and to a lesser extent by deleting rpP2β (Table II). This is in agreement with the findings presented above and further indicates that the soluble factor establishes functional interactions with the ribosomal stalk, and not only with rpP0, but also with rpP1α and perhaps with rpP2β as well. Sordarins are a new family of antifungal compounds and, together with tenuazonic acid (25Carrasco L. Vazquez D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 319: 209-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), the only protein synthesis inhibitors reported to show selectivity between different eukaryotes (17Kinsman O.S. Chalk P.A.

Ku T. Balkovec J. Schmatz D. Nielsen J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3148-3151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), but it was also immediately apparent that the inhibitor's mode of action involved additional cellular components, because resistant mutants were obtained outside EF21, and high affinity binding of the drug to macromolecules required the presence of ribosomes,2 suggesting that the binding site on EF2 is fully formed only after the factor interacts with a ribosome. In this work, experiments are described showing that rpP0, an essential component of the ribosomal large subunit stalk, plays a large role in determining the sensitivity to sordarin antifungal GM193663, as single point mutations in rpP0, and substitution of heterologous rpP0 proteins for the endogenous one, reduce measurably the sensitivity of yeast toward these compounds (Tables II and III). The results also indicate that there is a functional interaction between rpP0 and EF2, because mutations in any one of them render cells insensitive to the same translational inhibitor. This fits well with evidence indicating that elongation factors are probably recruited to the ribosome through interactions with the stalk (7Uchiumi T. Traut R.R. Kominami R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 89-95Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Uchiumi T. Kominami R. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3389-3394Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 13Stark H. Rodnina M.V.

Nature. 1988; 334: 362-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). The mechanism of resistance afforded by mutations in rpP0 is intriguing, and its elucidation may shed light into the molecular details of ribosomal translocation. The binding capacity for the inhibitor has been retained to a large extent by the resistant mutants (Fig. 2). If the hypothesis that sordarin antifungals impede conformational changes in EF2 is correct1 (18Justice M.C. Hsu M.J. Tse B. Ku T. Balkovec J. Schmatz D. Nielsen J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3148-3151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), then changes in rpP0 could somehow force or facilitate the appropriate bending of the EF2 molecule. According to the data presented here, in order for rpP0 to be able to “help” EF2 when blocked by GM193663, the protein must be part of a ribosomal stalk in which rpP1α and rpP2β are present. Stalk structures deficient in either of those proteins substantially reduce the capacity of mutant rpP0 to overcome the presence of the inhibitor. Interestingly, rpP1α and rpP2β are also the P-proteins whose deletion has the largest effect on growth rate (12Remacha M. Santos C. Bermejo B. Naranda T. Ballesta J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12061-12067Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). rpP1α may be able to establish some interaction with EF2 by itself, because lack of this ribosomal protein also reduces significantly resistance levels afforded by mutations in EF2 (Table II). There seems to be also an effect of the rpP2β deletion on EF2-mediated resistance, although the reduction in the IC50of the inhibitor is smaller in this case. All this hints at a wealth of functional interactions between elongation factors, or at least EF2, and components of the ribosomal P-protein stalk. Pairwise physical interactions between all these proteins are currently being analyzed by genetic and biochemical means. The screen for GM193663R mutants is by no means saturated. Ongoing work at several laboratories will possibly detect additional gene products involved in the mode of action of sordarin antifungals, which may in turn uncover new functional interactions, or confirm suspected ones, between components of the translation apparatus. In yeast there are described ribosomal protein mutations involved in resistance to cycloheximide, cryptopleurine, trichodermin, and now sordarin analogues (27Fried H.M. Warner J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 238-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 28Fried H.M. Warner J.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1982; 10: 3133-3148Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 29Larkin J.C.

Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 254-262Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Sordarin antifungals may however be unique in targeting the functional interaction between a soluble translation factor and ribosomal proteins, in such a manner as to allow both types of proteins to influence the cell's sensitivity to the inhibitor. The contribution of multiple elements to sensitivity may explain the large selectivity of these compounds, despite the high sequence conservation between the individual components of the eukaryotic translation apparatus. Sordarin antifungals are very selective drugs with a good therapeutic potential, and they are also turning out to be useful tools for the analysis of the elongation cycle during protein translation.

Glucose causes a coordinated transcriptional activation of the IEGs c-fos, c-jun, JunB, zif-268, and nur-77 in the pancreatic beta-cell line INS-1. This activation is entirely dependent on the presence of the cell-permeant cAMP analog chlorophenylthio-cAMP, which has only a modest effect by itself. The accumulation of c-fos, JunB, and nur-77 mRNA occurs at physiological concentrations of glucose (3 to 11 mM), requires a 1-2 h period, and is mimicked by other nutrient stimuli including mannose, leucine plus glutamine, and pyruvate. Glucose is synergistic with the glucoincretin peptides GLP-1 and PACAP-38, whereas these neurohormonal agents have no effect at low (3 mM) glucose. Mechanistically, the synergy between glucose and the glucoincretins is not based on cAMP alone as glucose does not further increase intracellular cAMP in response to GLP-1 and PACAP-38. A role for Ca2+ signaling is inferred, since the L-type Ca2+ channel blocker nifedipine markedly reduces the induction of c-fos and nur-77 by glucose and GLP-1. The induction of IEGs by glucose and chlorophenylthio-cAMP or GLP-1 and the inhibitory effect of nifedipine are also observed in the betaHC9 cell line. The results indicate that GLP-1 and PACAP-38 act as competence factors for the action of glucose on c-fos, JunB, and nur-77. It is suggested that the synergistic effect of glucose and glucoincretins on IEG expression plays an important role in the adaptive processes of the beta-cell to hyperglycemia."
https://openalex.org/W1949982917,"A stress-responsive gene highly expressed in brain and reproductive organs (BRE) is down-regulated after UV irradiation, DNA damaging agents, or retinoic acid treatment. The human BRE gene encodes a mRNA of 1.9 kb, which gives rise to a protein of 383 amino acids with a molecular size of 44 kilodaltons. BRE is not homologous to any known gene and its function has not been defined. Here we report that BRE was identified multiple times in a yeast two-hybrid screen of a murine cerebellar cDNA library, using the juxtamembrane domain of the p55 tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF) receptor. The interaction between the p55 receptor and BRE was verified by an in vitro biochemical assay by using recombinant fusion proteins and by co-immunoprecipitation of transfected mammalian cells. In the yeast two-hybrid assay, BRE specifically interacted with p55 TNF receptor but not with other TNF family members such as the Fas receptor, the p75 TNF receptor, and p75 neurotrophin receptor. Overexpression of BRE inhibited TNF-induced NFkappaB activation, indicating that the interaction of BRE protein with the cytoplasmic region of p55 TNF receptor may modulate signal transduction by TNF-alpha."
https://openalex.org/W1997360702,"A 190 amino acid-long region centered around position 1050 of the 1407-amino acid-long β′ subunit of Escherichia coli RNA polymerase (RNAP) is absent from homologues in eukaryotes, archaea and many bacteria. In chloroplasts, the corresponding region can be more than 900 amino acids long. The role of this hypervariable region was studied by deletion mutagenesis of the cloned E. coli rpoC, encoding β′. Long deletions mimicking β′ from Gram-positive bacteria failed to assemble into RNAP. Mutants with short, 40–60-amino acid-long deletions spanning β′ residues 941–1130 assembled into active RNAP in vitro. These mutant enzymes were defective in the transcript cleavage reaction and had dramatically reduced transcription elongation rates at subsaturating substrate concentrations due to prolonged pausing at sites of transcriptional arrest. Binding of a monoclonal antibody, Pyn1, to the hypervariable region inhibited transcription elongation and intrinsic transcript cleavage and, to a lesser degree, GreB-induced transcript cleavage, but did not interfere with GreB binding to RNAP.

DNA-dependent RNA polymerases from eubacteria share a common subunit composition (1Zillig W. Gropp F. Reznikoff W.S. Burgess R.R. Dahlberg J.E. Gross C.A. Record Jr., M.T. Wickens M.P. RNA Polymerase and the Regulation of Transcription. Elsevier Science Publishing Corp., New York1986: 17-24Google Scholar). The core RNAP1 enzyme (subunit composition α2ββ′) is catalytically proficient but is unable to initiate transcription on promoters. Binding of a ς subunit converts the core enzyme into a holoenzyme, which can recognize a specific set of promoters (2Gross C.A. Lonetto M. Losick R. Yamamoto K. McKnight S. Transcriptional Regulation. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992: 129-176Google Scholar). The β and β′ subunits together constitute more than 80% of the core RNAP mass and jointly form the catalytic center of the enzyme (3Mustaev A. Kashlev M. Lee J.Y. Polyakov A. Lebedev A. Zalenskaya K.

Heumann H. Nikiforov V. Goldfarb A. Mustaev A. Science. 1996; 73: 107-109Crossref Scopus (150) Google Scholar). RNAPs from eukaryotes and archaea have subunits that are homologous to β and β′ of eubacterial enzymes (5Allison L.A. Moyle M. Shales M. Ingles C.J. Cell. 1985; 42: 599-610Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar, 6Sweetser D. Nonet M. Young R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The evolutionary conservation within the β/β′ lineages is limited to relatively short segments of primary sequence; each subunit has 8–10 highly conserved segments. The amino- to carboxyl-terminal order of the conserved segments is invariant. The spacing between the conserved segments can vary even when subunits from closely related species are compared, due to an accumulation of insertions and deletions. There are several reasons why studies of such evolutionarily variable regions can shed light on RNAP structure and function. First, these regions may form docking sites for species-specific regulators of transcription (8Igarashi K. Ishihama A. Cell. 1991; 65: 1015-1022Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 9Severinov K. Kashlev M. Severinova E. Bass I. McWilliams K. Kutter E. Nikiforov V. Snyder L. Goldfarb A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14254-14259Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Second, variable regions are likely to be surface-exposed and can therefore be used for affinity tagging of RNAP and transcription complexes (10Tavormina P.L. Landick R. Gross C.A. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 5263-5271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Third, variable regions often tolerate splits, allowing preparation of functional RNAP with relatively short β and/or β′ subunit fragments, dramatically facilitating mapping of protein-protein and protein-nucleic acid contacts during transcription (11Severinov K. Mustaev A. Severinova E. Bass I. Kashlev M. Landick R. Nikiforov V. Goldfarb A. Darst S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4591-4595Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 12Severinov K. Mustaev A. Kukarin A. Muzzin O. Bass I. Darst S.A. Goldfarb A. J. Biol.

The focus of this report is an evolutionary hypervariable region in the C-terminal portion of Escherichia coli β′ (amino acids 1141–1131). This region is highly variable in proteobacteria and is absent from homologs from most other bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes. Despite this apparent redundancy, numerous point mutations that altered the termination and elongation properties of E. coli RNAP were localized in the hypervariable region (25Weilbaecher R. Hebron C. Feng G. Landick R. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2913-2927Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 37Ito K. Nakamura Y. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1996; 251: 699-706PubMed Google Scholar, 38Petersen S.K. Hansen F.G. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 5200-5206Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, mutations in the largest (β′-like) subunit of yeast RNAP II that occurred very close to the hypervariable region dramatically decreased interaction of the enzyme with transcript cleavage factor TFIIS (33Wu J. Awrey D.E. Edwards A.M. Archambault J. Friesen J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11552-11557Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Here, we probed the role of the hypervariable region and adjacent segments of E. coli β′ by deletion mutagenesis of the cloned rpoC gene. Mutant RNAPs were assembled in vitro, and their elongation and termination properties, as well as their abilities to interact with the TFIIS analog GreB, were determined. A long deletion that completely removed the hypervariable region blocked enzyme assembly in vivo and in vitro. Short (40–60 amino acid) deletions, which together span the entire hypervariable region, did not prevent RNAP assembly and basic transcription function in vitro; however, the mutant enzymes had a dramatic defect in transcript elongation at low substrate concentrations. At high substrate concentrations, the mutants elongated and terminated transcription normally. The mutant enzymes were also defective in GreB-induced transcript cleavage, but the nature of the defect was complex, because both the ability to interact with GreB and the ability to support intrinsic transcript cleavage by the RNAP catalytic center were altered by mutations. A binding epitope for an inhibitory mAb, Pyn1, was mapped in the hypervariable region. Binding of Pyn1 to RNAP efficiently inhibited both the RNA synthesis and transcript cleavage reactions. Our data thus demonstrate that the evolutionary hypervariable region of β′, which is completely absent from homologues from eukaryotes, archaea, and many eubacteria, is unexpectedly important for E. coli RNAP assembly and is involved in transcript elongation and cleavage. Because this region is missing from β′ homologues from most organisms, however, this involvement is probably indirect. The pUC19-based pMKa201S793F rpoC expression plasmid was used to generate deletions in the rpoC gene. The plasmid is a derivative of pMKA201 (13Kashlev M. Martin E. Polyakov A. Severinov K. Nikiforov V. Goldfarb A. Gene. 1993; 130: 9-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) and carries a transdominant streptolydigin-resistance mutation, changing β′ Ser793 to Phe (14Severinov K. Markov D. Severinova E. Nikiforov V. Landick R. Darst S.A. Goldfarb A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23926-23929Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). To generate nested Bal31 deletions in pMKa201S793F, a unique BamHI linker was inserted in the EcoRI site at codon 987 of the structural gene. pMKa201S793F was underdigested with EcoRI (cut twice at codons 175 and 987 of the structural gene and once in the vector), and ligated to the EcoRI fragment from phage mp17Km carrying the kanamycin resistance gene (11Severinov K. Mustaev A. Severinova E. Bass I. Kashlev M. Landick R. Nikiforov V. Goldfarb A. Darst S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4591-4595Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Kanamycin-resistant transformants were screened for the appearance of inducible truncated fragments of the β′ polypeptide using SDS-PAGE. Recombinant plasmids containing kanamycin cassette inserted at rpoC position 987 was treated with BamHI to remove the cassette and recircularized. The resultant plasmid pIBΩ987 overproduced β′ with 6 amino acids (IPRIRG) inserted between amino acids 987 and 988. To generate deletions, pIBΩ987 was linearized withBamHI, treated with Bal31 for various times, and recircularized. After transformation in E. coli XL1-Blue cells, transformants were screened for the appearance of inducible β′ polypeptides with increased mobility on SDS-gels. pIBΔ(1145–1198) was constructed by treating pMKa201S793F with AsuI (cut twice at codons 1145 and 1198 of the structural gene) and religating. pIBΔ(1091–1130) was constructed from a plasmid expressing the C-terminal portion of rpoC (β′877–1407, Ref. 12Severinov K.

Chem. 1996; 271: 27969-27974Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), containing two in-frame KpnI recognition sites corresponding to rpoC codons 1091 and 1130. TherpoC fragment containing the deletion was then recloned back into pMKa201S793F. Plasmids expressing Δ(877–948), Δ(941–1130), Δ(1042–1091), and Δ(1131–1155)S were constructed by annealing a pair of corresponding “outward” primers, followed by polymerase chain reaction amplification of the whole pMKa201S793F plasmid (30 cycles of 1 min at 94 °C, 1 min at 56 °C, and 8 min at 72 °C). Each primer used in the amplification reaction contained an in-frameBamHI site. The amplified plasmid was treated withBamHI, recircularized, and transformed in XL1-Blue cells. Transformants were screened for the appearance of inducible β′ polypeptides with increased mobility on SDS-gels, and deletions were confirmed by DNA sequencing. To minimize polymerase chain reaction-related errors, deletions were recloned asSalI-SacII (cut at rpoC codons 877 and 1321, respectively) fragments back into appropriately treated parental pMKa201S793F. All of the overexpressed β′ subunit variants were found in inclusion bodies when induced with 1 mm IPTG at 37 °C. mAbs Pyn1 and Pyn4 were described previously (15Gragerov A.I. Nikiforov V.G. FEBS Lett. 1980; 122: 17-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). mAbs were precipitated from ascites fluid by addition of (NH4)2SO4 to 50% saturation. Before use, aliquots of precipitated protein were dialyzed into transcription buffer. Some mAb preparations contained an RNase activity. Hence, transcription reactions were supplemented with 0.5 mg of tRNA to prevent the degradation of RNA in transcription complexes. The working concentration of mAb was determined by combining a fixed amount of RNAP with increasing amounts of mAb, followed by separation of protein complexes on native 4–15% Phast gels (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The amount of mAb used in transcription reactions was twice the amount needed to shift completely the band of RNAP on a native gel. RNAP was reconstituted according to the published procedure (16Tang H. Severinov K. Goldfarb A. Ebright R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4902-4906Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The molar ratio of α, β, and mutant β′ in the reconstitution reactions was 1:4:8. After reconstitution and thermoactivation in the presence of ς70, RNAP preparations were either used directly or further purified by FPLC/gel-filtration on a Superose-6 and Mono Q columns (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as described (17Borukhov S. Goldfarb A. Protein Expression Purif. 1993; 4: 503-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), concentrated by filtration through a C-100 concentrator (Amicon) to ∼1 mg/ml, and stored in 50% glycerol storage buffer at −20 °C. The synthesis of photoactive 4-azidotetrafluorobenzylamino-pApUpC derivative will be described elsewhere (18Keana J.F.W. Cai S.H. J. Org. Chem. 1990; 55: 3640-3647Crossref Scopus (259) Google Scholar). 2A. Mustaev and A. Goldfarb, manuscript in preparation. A standard 20-μl cross-linking reaction contained 0.5–1 μg of RNAP holoenzyme immobilized on ∼5 μl of Ni2+-NTA agarose (Qiagen), 0.5 μg of the 324-base pair DNA fragment containing T7 A1 promoter (template 1 of Ref. 18Keana J.F.W. Cai S.H. J. Org. Chem. 1990; 55: 3640-3647Crossref Scopus (259) Google Scholar), and 10 μm ApUpC in standard transcription buffer containing 40 mm KCl, 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 10 mm MgCl2. Reactions were incubated for 5 min at 37 °C to form the open complexes and transferred to room temperature, and ATP and GTP were added to a final concentration of 25 μm. After a 10-min incubation, reactions were washed three times with 1.5 ml of transcription buffer as described (13Kashlev M. Martin E. Polyakov A. Severinov K. Nikiforov V. Goldfarb A. Gene. 1993; 130: 9-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) and left in a ∼20-μl volume. α-[32P]CTP (3000 Ci/mmol, NEN Life Science Products) was added to a final concentration of 0.3 μm, and the incubation was continued for 10 min. After washing, the immobilized EC12 was UV-irradiated with a hand-held lamp at 254 nm for 3 min. The lamp was positioned flat at the top of open Eppendorf tubes that contained the reaction mixtures and that were kept on ice. After irradiation, EC12 was desorbed from the solid support by addition of imidazole to 100 mm, an equal volume of SDS-containing Laemmli loading buffer (20Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205487) Google Scholar) was added, and proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE. In protein-RNA cross-linking experiments in the presence of GreB, immobilized EC20 containing radioactively labeled RNA was prepared and used to prepare EC21 with 4-thio-UTP instead of UTP. Derivatized EC21 was washed with transcription buffer lacking MgCl2 and desorbed from Ni2+-NTA agarose by the addition of 100 mm imidazole. Recombinant GreB (a generous gift of Arun Malhotra, University of Miami) was added to reaction aliquots followed by UV-irradiation as described above. Reaction products were then resolved by SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography. To determine transcription elongation rates, elongation complexes stalled at position +20 were prepared in 50 μl of transcription buffer containing 25 μl of Ni2+-NTA agarose, 20 nm of T7 A1 promoter DNA fragment described above, 40 nm RNAP, 0.5 mmApU, 50 μm CTP and GTP, 2.5 μm[α32P]ATP (300 Ci/mmol). Reactions were incubated for 15 min at 23 °C and were washed as described above. Washed EC20 was synchronously started by making reactions 2.5 μm with NTPs. Reactions proceeded for 0–600 s at 23 °C. Reactions were terminated by the addition of formamide-containing loading buffer. To determine transcription termination efficiencies, EC20 was restarted by the addition of 250 μm NTPs. Reactions proceeded for 1 min at 23 °C. Products were analyzed by urea-PAGE electrophoresis (7m urea, 6% polyacrylamide), followed by autoradiography and PhosphorImager analysis. Purified immobilized elongation complexes were briefly washed with 1 ml of transcription buffer, pH 9.0. Reactions were left in ∼50 μl and incubated at room temperature. At various time points, reaction aliquots were withdrawn, combined with an equal volume of formamide-containing loading buffer, and analyzed by denaturing gel-electrophoresis and autoradiography. Cleavage with GreB was done as described earlier (21Orlova M. Newlands J. Das A. Goldfarb A. Borukhov S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4596-4600Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Alignment of the amino acid sequence of E. coli β′ with homologues from other organisms reveals a long region of primary sequence (E. coliresidues 941–1131) that is present in proteobacteria but is totally absent in homologues from other eubacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes (Fig. 1). In contrast, a much longer sequence (up to 900 amino acids) is found in the corresponding region of β′ subunits from cyanobacteria and chloroplasts. On the N terminus of this hypervariable region is highly conserved segment G (residues 912–940). C-terminal to the hypervariable region is a short segment of conserved sequence that we will refer to as segment G′ (residues 1132–1148; Fig. 1). Segments G and G′ form one continuous stretch of conserved amino acids in eukaryotes, archaea, and most bacteria. Sequence C-terminal to G′ is not conserved and is followed by the C-terminal conserved segment H (residues 1324–1362). We probed the functional role of the hypervariable region by deletion mutagenesis of the cloned E. coli rpoC gene. A linker insertion mutation and a set of limited deletions were obtained as described under “Materials and Methods” and are shown above the alignment in Fig. 1. Δ(941–1130) removed all of the E. coli hypervariable region and thus resembles the β′ subunit fromMycobacterium leprae (22Honore N. Bergh S. Chanteau S. Doucet-Populaire F. Eiglmeier K. Garnier T. Georges C. Launois P. Limpaiboon P. Newton S. Nyang K. del Potillo P. Ramesh G.K. Reddy T. Riedel J.P. Sittisombut N. Wu-Nunter S. Cole S.T. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 7: 207-214Crossref Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Δ(1131–1155)S removed all of segment G′ and replaced it with a Ser residue; Δ(877–948) (not shown in Fig. 1) deleted conserved segment G. Δ(1145–1198) removed 54 amino acids immediately C-terminal to G′. Δ(1145–1198)removed coding sequences between in-frame naturally occurring recognition sites of restriction endonuclease AsuI and is referred to as ΔAsu throughout the text. Similarly,Δ(1091–1130) removed coding sequences between the in-frame naturally occurring KpnI sites and is referred to as ΔKpn. Previously, one of us reported the isolation of two anti-β′ mAbs, Pyn1 and Pyn4, using RNAP core enzyme as an antigene (15Gragerov A.I. Nikiforov V.G. FEBS Lett. 1980; 122: 17-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Pyn1 efficiently inhibited transcription by E. coli RNAP as well as by the Pseudomonas putidaenzyme, 3A. Lebedev and V. Nikiforov, unpublished results. whereas Pyn4 had no effect on transcription (15Gragerov A.I. Nikiforov V.G. FEBS Lett. 1980; 122: 17-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). We localized Pyn1 and Pyn4 binding epitopes using the β′ deletion mutants described above. To locate mAb binding epitopes, cells expressing different plasmid-borne variants of rpoC were induced and lysed, and proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, followed by Western blotting with Pyn1 or Pyn4. As shown in Table I, all deletions in the hypervariable region abolished Pyn1 binding and thus must have destroyed the binding epitope. In contrast, Δ(877–948), Δ(1131–1155)S, and ΔAsu did not affect Pyn1 binding. These data suggest that β′ amino acids 949–1091 contain the Pyn1 binding epitope. However, because both Δ(941-1000) and ΔKpn—Δ(1091-1130), which are 90 amino acids apart, disrupt Pyn1 binding, the antibody epitope may be conformational rather than linear. Thus, we can not exclude that β′ sequences outside the hypervariable region may also participate in the binding of this inhibitory antibody.Table IProperties of rpoC mutantsAlleleStlrpoCsuppressionAssemblyPyn1Pyn4Wild type−++++S693F+++++Ω987+++++Δ(877–948) [ΔG]−−−++Δ(941–1130)−−−−+Δ(941–1000)−+/−+−+Δ(1042–1091)−+/−+−+Δ(1091–1130) [ΔKpn]−+/−+−+Δ(1131–1155)S [ΔG′]−−−++Δ(1145–1198) [ΔAsu]−+++−Colony formation by CAG14064 (13Kashlev M.

When CAG 14064 cells overproducing the WT and mutant β′ subunits were plated on a medium containing 12.5 μg/ml streptolydigin, only cells overproducing parental S693F β′, and the linker insertion Ω987 formed colonies (Table I). In another test of the in vivo function of mutantrpoC genes, the RL602 E. coli cells were transformed with pMKa201S693F and its derivatives, and plated at 42 °C. RL602 cells harbor an amber mutation in the chromosomal copy of rpoC that is suppressed by a temperature-sensitive suppressor (23Severinov K. Mooney R. Darst S.A. Landick R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24137-24140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). RL602 grows at 30 °C but fails completely to grow at 42 °C. Cells overproducing S693F β′, as well as Ω987, Δ(1042–1091), Δ(941–1000), Δ(987–1042), ΔKpn, and ΔAsu formed colonies at the elevated temperature (data not shown). Cells overproducing S693F β′, Ω987, and ΔAsu grew robustly at 42 °C, whereas the others formed minute colonies (Table I). We do not know whether the mutant β′ subunits were the only source of β′ at high temperature. Landick et al. (24Landick R. Colwell A. Stewart J. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 2844-2854Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) encountered similar “partial” phenotypes when testing in vivofunction of mutant, plasmid-borne rpoB genes. These authors suggested that growth at restrictive temperature may occur when the plasmid-borne rpo gene provides enough partially functional RNAP to allow the growth of the host, which has a low level of the wild-type, chromosomally encoded RNAP even at restrictive temperature. In contrast, administering streptolydigin completely inhibits wild-type, chromosomal RNAP, and thus prevents the cell growth. Because the results of functional assays in vivo were inconclusive, we assembled mutant β′ into RNAP in vitro. Assembled RNAP forms characteristic peaks during chromatography on Superose-6 and Mono Q columns (17Borukhov S. Goldfarb A. Protein Expression Purif. 1993; 4: 503-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). No such peaks were observed in the course of purification of reconstitution mixtures containing Δ(877–948), Δ(1131–1155)S, and Δ(941–1130) and WT α, β, and ς subunits; neither crude reconstitution mixtures nor chromatographic fractions contained any RNAP activity (Table I and data not shown). The β′ subunits expressed from pMK201 plasmid are fused to the C-terminal His6 tag, allowing easy purification of RNAP harboring plasmid-borne β′ (13Kashlev M. Martin E. Polyakov A. Severinov K. Nikiforov V. Goldfarb A. Gene. 1993; 130: 9-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Our repeated attempts to purify RNAPs harboring the two largest β′ deletions from cells using affinity chromatography failed (data not shown). We conclude that deletions of conserved segments G and G′, as well as removal of the entire hypervariable region, completely abolish the ability of β′ to enter E. coli RNAP core in vitro and in vivo. 5 smaller deletions (Δ(941–1000), Δ(987–1042), Δ(1042–1091), ΔKpn and ΔAsu) assembled into RNAP in vitro as judged by the appearance of characteristic chromatographic peaks in the course of purification. The catalytic proficiency of RNAP mutants was demonstrated by template-dependent affinity labeling of shortened β′ polypeptides with derivatized nascent RNA. In this reaction, Ni2+-NTA agarose-immobilized RNAP was used to form open complexes with the T7 A1 promoter-containing DNA fragment. Transcription was primed with a derivatized, photoactive ApUpC, complimentary to positions +1–+3 of the promoter. In the presence of unlabeled GTP and ATP, transcription proceeded to position +11 and was halted because of the absence of CTP, specified by the position +12 of the template. After extensive washing, elongation complexes stalled at position 11 (EC11) were extended with radioactive CTP to obtain EC12. EC12 containing radioactive and photoactive RNA was washed and UV-irradiated to induce protein-RNA cross-link formation, and the reaction products were separated by SDS-PAGE. Irradiation of RNAPWT elongation complexes resulted in radioactive labeling of both β and β′ with equal efficiency (Fig. 2 A). As can be seen from the autoradiogram presented on Fig. 2 A, labeled, full-sized β′ is absent from lanes containing mutant enzymes, establishing that little or no contaminating RNAPWT was present. Instead, lanes containing mutant enzymes have a labeled band with the mobility of β, which represents a mixture of labeled full-sized β and mutant β′ subunits (full-sized β′ and β are 1407 and 1342 amino acids long, respectively; deletions in β′ make it impossible to separate the two proteins by SDS-PAGE). Control experiments established that (i) subunit labeling was template-dependent, and (ii) subunit labeling did not occur when photoactive, radioactive RNA 12-mer was added to RNAP in trans. Furthermore, cleavage of the RNA-product adduct with formic acid demonstrated that the RNA moiety of the adduct was"

Barium currents through Bay K 8644 (10–6M) sensitive L-type channels were measured using the patch-clamp technique. The current density of L-type currents is twice as high and the inactivation time constants are much slower than in cells from nondystrophic control rats. Application of the PTK blockers genistein, lavendustin A, and herbimycin A (all 5× 10–6 M) led to an increase of L-type currents. Intracellular application of pp60c-src (30 U/ml) via the patch pipette led to a transient decrease of L-type currents. The protein kinase A (PKA) and PKG blocker H9 (10–6 M) showed no effect on L-type currents. However, the protein kinase C blocker chelerythrine (10–5 M) reduced these currents. Up-regulation of PKC by 10–6 M 4β-phorbol-12 myristate-13 acetate (PMA) led to a decrease of L-type currents. Additional application of genistein led to a further decrease of these currents. However, intracellular application of pp60c-src in PMA-treated cells led to a transient increase of L-type currents. Investigating the calcium response to bFGF application showed that RPE cells from RCS rats used different pathways than control RPE cells to increase cytosolic free calcium. This different pathway does not involve the activation of L-type channels. The present study with RPE cells from rats with retinal dystrophy shows a changed integration of PTK and PKC in channel regulation. Considering the altered response to bFGF in RCS-RPE cells, this disturbed regulation of L-type channels by tyrosine kinases is involved in the etiology of retinal degeneration in RCS rats.—Mergler, S., Steinhausen, K., Wiederholt, M., Strauss, O.

Different signaling states of the cytoplasmic domain modulate the kinase autophosphorylation rate over at least a 100-fold range. Biochemical and genetic studies have implicated a specific region of the cytoplasmic domain, termed the signaling subdomain, as the region that transmits regulation from the receptor to the kinase.

This helix, termed α7, ranges approximately from residue 355 through 386. Activity measurements probing the effects of cysteine substitutions in vivo and in vitro reveal that both faces of helix α7 are critical for kinase activation, while the buried face is especially critical for kinase down-regulation. Disulfide scanning of the region suggests that helix α7 is not in direct contact with its symmetric partner (α7′) from the other subunit; presently, the structural element that packs against the buried face of the helix remains unidentified.

A fundamental question in signaling biology concerns the mechanism by which cell surface receptors regulate cytoplasmic kinases. Certain receptors activate their associated kinases by dimerization, but in other cases kinase activation is triggered by a transmembrane conformational change. One class of receptors that generates such conformational regulation is the large group of cell surface receptors that modulate histidine kinases in prokaryotic and eukaryotic two-component signaling pathways (reviewed in Refs. 1Milburn M.V.

The aspartate receptor of bacterial chemotaxis is representative of this diverse class. The aspartate receptor is one of the ligand specific dimeric receptors utilized by the related chemotaxis pathways of Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium to recognize periplasmic attractant and repellent molecules. This receptor binds aspartate, an attractant, in the periplasm and propagates a signal across the bilayer to an associated histidine kinase in the cytoplasm. Receptor-kinase coupling is provided by the formation of a kinetically stable ternary complex between the cytoplasmic domain of the receptor, the coupling protein CheW, and the histidine kinase CheA (10Gegner J.A. Graham D.R. Roth A.F. Dahlquist F.W. Cell. 1992; 70: 975-982Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar, 11Schuster S.C. Swanson R.V. Alex L.A. Bourret R.B. Simon M.I. Nature. 1993; 365: 343-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). The cytoplasmic phosphorylation cascade is initiated by receptor-stimulated CheA autophosphorylation; subsequently, phospho-CheA becomes the substrate for a phospho-transfer reaction that phosphorylates one of two response regulator proteins, CheY or CheB (12Borkovich K.A. Kaplan N. Hess J.F. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 1208-1212Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 13Ninfa E.G. Stock A.M. Mowbray S.L. Stock J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9764-9770Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Phospho-CheY controls the swimming activity of the cell by docking to the flagellar motor, while phospho-CheB regulates the adaptation branch of the chemotaxis pathway by hydrolyzing the methyl esters of specific glutamates that serve as receptor adaptation sites (14Barak R. Eisenbach M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 1821-1826Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 15Kehry M.R. Doak T.G. Dahlquist F.W. J.

Kaplan N. Simon M.I. Cell. 1988; 53: 79-87Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). The level of receptor-mediated CheA kinase activation or down-regulation is determined by the sum of the signals generated by ligand binding to the receptor in the periplasm, and the level of receptor methylation in the cytoplasm (12Borkovich K.A. Kaplan N. Hess J.F. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 1208-1212Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 13Ninfa E.G. Stock A.M. Mowbray S.L. Stock J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9764-9770Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since aspartate binding down-regulates the kinase activity while receptor methylation stimulates the kinase, the two signals oppose each other to provide a negative feedback loop that optimizes the signal output of the ternary complex (2Falke J.J. Bass R.B. Butler S.L. Chervitz S.A. Danielson M.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 457-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). The bacterial chemoreceptors, including the aspartate receptor, belong to the taxis receptor subfamily of the two-component receptor superfamily. The taxis receptor subfamily spans at least 60 known homologues proposed to initiate the thermo-, photo-, osmo-, redox-, and chemotaxis pathways of a wide variety of prokaryotic organisms (18Danielson M.A. The Molecular Mechanism of Transmembrane Signaling and Kinase Regulation by the Aspartate Receptor of Bacterial ChemotaxisPh.D. thesis.

Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 6573-6580Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The primary structures of subfamily members diverge greatly in their periplasmic domains, which are specific for different stimuli; however, their cytoplasmic domains are highly conserved (18Danielson M.A. The Molecular Mechanism of Transmembrane Signaling and Kinase Regulation by the Aspartate Receptor of Bacterial ChemotaxisPh.D. thesis.

These receptors also possess a conserved mechanism of transmembrane signaling and kinase regulation, as demonstrated by the formation of active chimeric receptors via the fusion of receptor domains from distantly related pathways (26Baumgartner J.W. Kim C. Brissette R.E. Inouye M. Park C. Hazelbauer G.L. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 1157-1163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Krikos A. Conley M.P. Boyd A. Berg H.C. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Microbiol. 1994; 14: 755-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Moreover, an active chimera has been generated by fusing the transmembrane signaling domain of the aspartate receptor and the tyrosine kinase domain of the human insulin receptor, indicating that even these unrelated receptors may use similar mechanisms of conformational transmembrane kinase regulation (30Biemann H.-P. Harmer S.L. Koshland Jr., D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27927-27930Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar,31Moe G.R. Bollag E. Koshland Jr., D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5683-5687Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The periplasmic and transmembrane regions of the aspartate receptor are structurally well characterized. The receptor is a homodimer of two stably associated 60-kDa subunits (32Milligan D.L. Koshland Jr., D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6268-6275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A high resolution crystal structure of the isolated periplasmic domain has revealed a dimer of two four-helix bundles (α1-α 4 and α1′-α4′), where the symmetric helices α1 and α1′ form a tightly associated coiled coil at the dimer interface (1Milburn M.V.

The structure of the transmembrane region has been characterized by disulfide mapping and consists of a bundle of the four membrane-spanning helices α1/TM1, α1′/TM1′, α4/TM2, and α4′/TM2′ (33Chervitz S.A.

Chem. 1988; 263: 14850-14858Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanism of transmembrane signaling is a subtle piston-type displacement of the signaling helix α4/TM2 toward the cytoplasm, as observed in the superimposed crystal structures of the apo- and aspartate-occupied periplasmic domain (43Chervitz S.A. Falke J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2545-2550Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Further evidence for the piston displacement is provided by engineered disulfide bonds that lock the membrane-bound receptor in the on and off states, by ligand-induced changes in disulfide formation rates detected in a closely related receptor for ribose and galactose, and, most recently, by spin-labeled ESR measurements (34Chervitz S.A.

Until recently, comparatively little structural information has been available for the cytoplasmic domain of the receptor, because its unusually dynamic conformation has prevented analysis by high resolution methods (46Seeley S.K. Weis R.M. Thompson L.K. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5199-5206Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Earlier hydrodynamic studies indicated that the cytoplasmic domain is highly elongated, while circular dichroism studies revealed a high degree of α-helicity (47Long D.G. Weis R.M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 9904-9911Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 48Mowbray S.L. Foster D.L. Koshland Jr., D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 11711-11718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cytoplasmic domain is functionally critical, because it contains the adaptive methylation sites and the docking sites for the kinase CheA and coupling protein CheW in the active ternary complex. Once formed, the ternary complex containing the receptor, CheW, and CheA, is stable for tens of minutes, regardless of the receptor ligand occupancy and methylation state (10Gegner J.A. Graham D.R. Roth A.F. Dahlquist F.W. Cell. 1992; 70: 975-982Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar, 11Schuster S.C. Swanson R.V. Alex L.A. Bourret R.B. Simon M.I. Nature. 1993; 365: 343-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). The adaptive methylation sites are glutamate side chains located at positions 295, 302, 309, and 491 within the cytoplasmic domain (49Terwilliger T.C. Koshland Jr., D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 7719-7725Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These residues are methyl-esterified by the methyltransferase CheR, which binds to a specific site at the receptor C terminus, and are demethylated by phospho-CheB (50Lupas A. Stock J.B. J. Biol.

The signaling subdomain, extending approximately from residue 348 through 427, lies between the third and fourth methylation sites (18Danielson M.A. The Molecular Mechanism of Transmembrane Signaling and Kinase Regulation by the Aspartate Receptor of Bacterial ChemotaxisPh.D. thesis.

Helices α5 and α6 were determined by disulfide mapping to be at the dimer interface. Helix α6 contains three of the four sites of adaptive methylation at positions 295, 302, and 309. However, despite its functional significance, the structure of the signaling subdomain remains unknown. Genetic studies have shown that this subdomain contains the site(s) of interaction with the coupling protein CheW, and biochemical studies have implicated it as a major locus of CheA interactions as well (53Ames P., Yu, Y.A. Parkinson J.S. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 737-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 54Ames P. Parkinson J.S. J.

Finally, the signaling subdomain of a related receptor has been shown to be unusually susceptible to mutations that lock the swimming behavior of cells (61Ames P. Parkinson J.S. Cell. 1988; 55: 817-826Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Given these observations, the signaling subdomain is a prime target for structural studies designed to characterize the mechanism by which a receptor-mediated transmembrane signal is translated by the cytoplasmic domain into kinase regulation. Cysteine and disulfide scanning has proven to be an invaluable tool for the determination of protein structure and has the advantage of not being limited by the size of the macromolecule to be studied (33Chervitz S.A.

This technique has been successfully employed in previous structural and mechanistic studies of the bacterial chemoreceptors that revealed the aforementioned helices α4–α6 of the cytoplasmic domain (57Danielson M.A. Bass R.B.

The present study extends the cysteine and disulfide scanning approach to the N-terminal half of the signaling domain, where the goal is to elucidate the secondary structure, packing, and function of the region. The results reveal an α-helix with distinct exposed and buried faces. Both of these faces are critical for kinase activation, while the buried face is particularly critical for kinase down-regulation. The exposed face near the C terminus of the helix is found to provide a docking site for CheW, CheA, or both, as revealed by the protein interactions by cysteine modification (PICM)1method. The E. coli strains utilized were kindly provided by Dr. John S. Parkinson (University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT).

Kunkel mutagenesis reagents (T7 DNA polymerase, T4 DNA ligase, and deoxynucleotide triphosphates) were purchased from Bio-Rad. Unless specifically noted, all other reagents were obtained from Sigma and were reagent grade. Individual cysteine-containing receptors were created by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis of the plasmid pSCF6 by the method of Kunkel et al. as modified by the Bio-Rad phagemid mutagenesis kit (33Chervitz S.A.

Bonner D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1956; 218: 97-106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were harvested by centrifugation in a GS-3 rotor (Sorvall) at 6000 rpm (6080 × g) for 10 min. Cells were resuspended in 6 ml of ice-cold low salt buffer containing 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, with NaOH, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 10 mm EDTA, 50 mm DTT, 2.5 mm 1,10-phenanthroline, and 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride in thin walled ultracentrifuge tubes (Beckman) in an ice/salt water bath and lysed by sonication (3 × 20-s bursts with 20-s cooling intervals using a Mysonics model W-385 sonicator equipped with a macrotip). Cell debris was pelleted in a TLA 100.3 rotor (Beckman) at 15,000 rpm (12,000 × g) for 20 min. Supernatants were transferred to fresh tubes, and membranes were pelleted in a TLA100.3 rotor at 100,000 rpm (540,000 ×g) for 15 min. Pellets were resuspended in 0.5 ml of high salt buffer, 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, with NaOH, 2m KCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 10 mm EDTA, 5 mm DTT, 2.5 mm 1,10-phenanthroline, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Resuspension was achieved by placing tubes in an ice/salt water bath and sonicating with the aforementioned sonicator equipped with a microtip (2 × 20-s bursts and 20-s cooling intervals). Membranes were diluted to 3 ml in high salt buffer, pelleted again, and resuspended as above, except DTT and phenanthroline were omitted. Finally, receptor-containing membranes were resuspended in 0.5 ml of final buffer containing 20 mmsodium phosphate, pH 7.0, with NaOH, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride before diluting to 3 ml in final buffer, pelleting as above, and resuspending in 300 μl of final buffer. The resulting membranes were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. Protein samples were assayed for total protein using the BCA assay (Pierce) calibrated against bovine serum albumin standards (Pierce). After development, absorbance measurements were made using a microplate reader (Molecular Devices, Inc.). Protein purity was determined by quantitating the receptor and nonreceptor bands on a Coomassie-stained 10% Laemmli SDS-polyacrylamide gel (acrylamide:bisacrylamide ratio of 40:0.2) using a digital camera (Alpha Innotec) (68Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar). CheA, CheW, CheY, and CheR were produced and isolated as described previously (33Chervitz S.A. Lin C.M. Falke J.J.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10746-10756Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. All quantitation was performed using a digital camera (Alpha Innotec). Alkylation of each engineered receptor was performed with 5-IAF except in the case of the periplasmic control positions Thr95through His103, where both 5-IAF and IANBD were used as labels. Reaction conditions were essentially as described previously (58Butler S.L. Falke J.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10746-10756Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Briefly, the assay utilized a 40-μl reaction containing 5 μm receptor monomer in reaction buffer (10 mmsodium phosphate, pH 6.5, with NaOH, 50 mm NaCl, 50 mm KCl, and 10 mm EDTA), to which was added 300 μm 5-IAF in DMF. The reaction was allowed to proceed at 25 °C for 5 min. At that point, the reaction mixture was split, and half of the sample was quenched with 1.25 μl of β-mercaptoethanol to react with any remaining probe. The remainder of the sample was denatured with 0.6% (w/v) SDS at 95 °C, allowed to react for an additional 3 min, and then quenched as before. To each reaction was added 5 μl of 4× nonreducing Laemmli sample buffer, and then each was heated to 95 °C for 2 min prior to resolving on a 10% Laemmli SDS-polyacrylamide gel (acrylamide:bisacrylamide ratio of 40:0.2). Fluorescent receptor bands were visualized on a UV light box (Alpha Innotec) and quantitated with a digital camera (Alpha Innotec). Gels were subsequently stained with Coomassie, and the resulting receptor bands were quantitated with a digital camera to provide normalization of the fluorescent intensities for variations in the amount of receptor. Chemical reactivity was defined as the ratio of receptor alkylation in the folded versus the unfolded states. Chemotaxis swarm assays were performed in vivo as"

Among the distinct regulatory properties of adenylyl cyclases, one remains most intriguing– the inhibition of the enzyme by 3′-nucleotides via a domain referred to as the P-site (1Londos C. Wolff J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5482-5486Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). Inhibition via this domain is a property of all known isoforms of mammalian adenylyl cyclases, possibly save the enzyme from sperm (2Johnson R.A. Shoshani I. J. Biol.

These are (a) the nearly absolute requirement for an intact adenine, (b) the enhanced inhibitory potency of 2′-deoxy- and especially 2′,5′-dideoxy derivatives, and (c) the markedly enhanced potency elicited by the addition of 3′-phosphates. The family of ligands exhibiting the greatest potency follow the order: 3′-mono- < 3′-di < 3′-triphosphate and Ado1 < 2′-deoxyadenosine < 2′,5′-dd-Ado. Given the dependence of potency on 3′-phosphate group content and because the effectiveness of nucleotides to induce conformational transitions in some proteins has been proportional to the number of phosphates (11Goto Y. Okamura N. Aimoto S. J. Biochem. 1991; 109: 746-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), the possibility is suggested that 3′-tetra-phosphate derivatives would be yet more potent inhibitors of adenylyl cyclases. Consequently, 2′-deoxy- and 2′,5′-dideoxyadenosine 3′-tetraphosphates (2′-d-3′-A4P and 2′,5′-dd-3′-A4P) were synthesized and tested for inhibition of crude and purified forms of adenylyl cyclase. Detergent-solubilized preparations of adenylyl cyclase from rat and bovine brains were prepared and assayed as described previously (4Johnson R.A. Yeung S.-M.H. Stübner D. Bushfield M. Shoshani I.

EMBO J. 1985; 4: 3675-3679Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Inhibition kinetics were determined on enzyme assayed in duplicate or triplicate, with concentrations of divalent cation fixed in excess of the 5′ATP concentration as described previously (12Johnson R.A.

IC50 values were derived from inhibition curves and K i values from replots of slopes from Lineweaver-Burk plots comprising six to eight concentrations of inhibitor in at least two experiments for each condition. cAMP formation was linear with respect to reaction time and enzyme concentration under these reaction conditions. Activity of Na+/K+-ATPase was determined in a reaction mixture containing 50 mm triethanolamine·HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 20 mm KCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 100 μm 5′ATP, and ∼ 105 cpm [γ-32P]5′ATP in a volume of 100 μl. Reactions were for 10 min at 30 oC and were terminated by the addition of a 1-ml slurry of ice-cold 0.1m H3PO4 containing 25 mg of charcoal/ml. These suspensions were centrifuged, and a measured portion of the supernatant fraction containing the released32Pi was quantified by Ĉherenkov radiation in a liquid scintillation counter. The rate of32Pi release was linear with reaction time and enzyme concentrations under the conditions of these experiments. Activity was determined as described previously (16Walseth T.F. Johnson R.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 562: 11-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar) in a reaction mixture containing 50 mmtriethanolamine·HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm MgCl2, 40 μm cAMP, 1 mg of bovine serum albumin/ml, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 50 μm CaCl2, and ∼105 cpm [32P]cAMP in a volume of 100 μl. Reactions were for 10 min at 30 oC and were stopped by the addition of 20 μl of a solution containing 100 mmtriethanolamine·HCl, 25 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, and 4.53 mm cAMP. 5′-Nucleotidase from Crotalus atrox snake venom was then added to a final concentration of 0.8 mg/ml, and samples were incubated an additional 15 min at 30 oC. This second reaction was terminated by the addition of a 1-ml slurry of ice-cold 0.1m H3PO4 containing 25 mg of charcoal/ml. These suspensions were centrifuged, and a measured portion of the supernatant fraction containing the released32Pi was quantified by Ĉherenkov radiation in a liquid scintillation counter. Calmodulin (∼0.7 μm) caused a 3.1 ± 0.1-fold (n = 8) increase in the rate of cAMP hydrolysis by this phosphodiesterase preparation. This rate was linear with reaction time and enzyme concentrations under the conditions of these experiments. Holoenzyme was isolated from bovine muscle and enriched by ammonium sulfate precipitation and chromatography on DEAE-Sephadex by established procedures (17Gilman A.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1970; 67: 305-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (3358) Google Scholar). Activity was measured in a reaction mixture containing 10 mm Na-phosphate, pH 7.5, 1 mg of bovine serum albumin/ml, 5 mm MgCl2, 100 μmATP, and 10 μg of histone, in a volume of 70 μl. Reactions were started with the addition of protein kinase A and were for 15 min at 30 oC. They were terminated by spotting 50-μl portions of each sample on Whatman P81 phospho-cellulose paper filters (25 mm diameter) and placing these in ice-cold 75 mm phosphoric acid. Filters were then washed with two exchanges of the phosphoric acid and one wash with ethanol, each after perhaps 10 min. Filters were air dried, and adsorbed 32P-histone was quantified byĈherenkov radiation in a liquid scintillation counter. Histone phosphorylation was linear with enzyme concentration and reaction time under these assay conditions, with ATP utilization always less than 2%. The addition of 1 μm cAMP caused a 9.5 ± 0.4-fold (n = 9) increase in the rate of histone phosphorylation by this preparation of protein kinase A. Nucleotides were quantified after high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) as areas under peaks determined with a Waters 996 photo-diode array detector and the accompanying Millennium software (Version 2.10). Ion exchange chromatography was on an Altex Spherogel TSK DEAE-5PW column (5 μm, 7.5 × 75 mm) developed with sequential step gradients of triethylammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.5, to separate nucleoside 3′-mono-, 3′-di-, 3′-tri-, and 3′-tetraphosphates. Pentasodium triphosphate (21 g, 56.7 mmol) was dissolved in 200 ml of cold water, and the resulting solution was added to a Büchner funnel loaded with 1.3 liter of regenerated and washed Dowex 50 (H+form). Fractions of 100 ml were collected, and the free acid form of triphosphoric acid was eluted with cold water under aspiration. Pooled fractions were adjusted to pH 5.5 with tributylamine and then were lyophilized to give the tributylammonium salt of triphosphoric acid in the form of a gum. 2′,5′-Dideoxyadenosine 3′-O-[(2,2,2-tribromoethyl)morpholinophosphonate] (0.89 g, 1.5 mmol) was added to a solution of pyridine (80 ml) containing activated zinc (0.15 g) (18van Boom J.H. Burgers P.M.J. van der Marel G.A. Verdegaal C.H.M. Wille G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1977; 4: 1047-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and tributylammonium salt of triphosphoric acid (15 g, 15 mmol), under the exclusion of moisture. The mixture was stirred at room temperature for 2 days. The reaction was then concentrated in vacuo, diluted with cold water (300 ml), filtered, and then purified by chromatography on QAE-Sephadex (HCO3− form) with a linear gradient of triethylammonium bicarbonate (0.1–1 m). The appropriate fractions were lyophilized and then coevaporated several times with methanol, yielding 0.18 mmol of 2′,5′-dd-3′-A4P. This nucleotide was isolated as its sodium salt by addition of 1m sodium iodide in acetone to a methanol solution of the triethylammonium nucleotide. The precipitate was collected by centrifugation and washed three times with cold acetone and driedin vacuo giving the sodium salt of 2′,5′-dd-3′-A4P: 1H NMR (D2O) δ 1.41 (d, 3H, J = 6.5 Hz, 3H-5′), 2.80–3.00 (m, 2H, H-2′, and H-2""), 6.52 (t, 1H, J = 6.9 Hz, H-1′), 8.28 (s, 1H, H-2), 8.47(s, 1H, H-8). 31P NMR (D2O) δ −18.55(t, J = 17.1 Hz, P-3), −17.80 (t,J = 19.2 Hz, P-2), −8.09 (dd,J P-H = 9.1 Hz, J P-P = 18.1 Hz, P-1), −1.55 (d, J = 13.8 Hz, P-4). 5′-O-(Dimethoxytrityl)-2′-deoxyadenosine 3′–O-[(2, 2,2-tribromoethyl)morpholinophosphonate] (1.42 g, 2.5 mmol) was added to a solution of pyridine (50 ml) containing activated zinc (0.5 g) and tributylammonium salt of triphosphoric acid (15 g, 15 mmol), under the exclusion of moisture. The mixture was stirred at room temperature for 2 days. The reaction mixture was then concentrated in vacuo and treated with 80% acetic acid at room temperature for 30 min. The medium was then neutralized with a cold solution of 0.5 m NaHCO3, diluted to two liters, filtered, and then purified by chromatography on QAE-Sephadex as above, yielding 0.21 mmol of 2′-d-3′-A4P. This nucleotide was also isolated as its sodium salt as above. No impurities were noted on anion exchange HPLC: 1H NMR (D2O) δ 2.81–2.99 (m, 2H, H-2′ and H-2′′), 3.88 (d, 2H, 2H-5′), 4.40–4.45 (m, 1H, H-4′), 5.06–5.19 (m, 1H, H-3′), 6.55 (t, 1H, J= 6.7 Hz, H-1′), 8.26 (s, 1H, H-2), 8.40 (s, 1H, H-8); 31P NMR (D2O) δ −18.28 (t, J = 17.1 Hz, P-3), −17.24 (t, J = 17.9 Hz, P-2), −8.07 (dd,J P-H = 7.7 Hz, J P-P = 19.2 Hz, P-1), −1.44 (d, J = 18.4 Hz, P-4). [α-32P]5′ATP and [γ-32P]5′ATP were purchased from ICN Pharmaceuticals. Lubrol-PX (from Sigma, L-3753), used for solubilizing the enzyme, was filtered through alumina (Neutral, AG7, from Bio-Rad) to remove peroxides. [32P]cAMP was prepared from [α-32P]ATP by reaction with a purified preparation of adenylyl cyclase with 5 mm MnCl2 as divalent cation and in the absence of added unlabeled 5′ATP, as described previously (16Walseth T.F. Johnson R.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 562: 11-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). Calmodulin-sensitive cAMP-phosphodiesterase, isolated from chicken gizzard and chromatographically enriched on DEAE-cellulose, was a gift from Dr. Jack N. Wells, Department of Pharmacology, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN. Calmodulin was purified to homogeneity from porcine testes by established procedures (19Keravis T.M. Dumler B.H. Well J.N. J. Cyclic Nucleotide Protein Phosphor. Res. 1987; 11: 365-372Google Scholar). Dog kidney Na+/K+-ATPase was from Sigma, A7305. Pyridine was redistilled over CaH2. Charcoal used was carbon decolorizing alkaline Norit A (C-176) from Fisher Scientific that was then activated. Tetrahydrofuran was distilled from benzophenone ketyl before use. NMR spectra were recorded with a Bruker AC250 at 250 MHz for proton spectra and at 101 MHz for 31P spectra, with an 85% solution of H3PO4 as external standard. The purity of the nucleotides was checked by HPLC with a DEAE column (above), eluted with gradient of triethylammonium bicarbonate and with ion pair chromatography on an Ultrasphere C18 column (5 μm; 4.6 × 250 mm), eluted with a gradient from 10 mm tetrabutylammonium hydroxide, 10 mmKH2PO4, 1% methanol, pH 5.5 to 2.8 mm tetrabutylammonium hydroxide, 100 mmKH2PO4, 30% methanol, pH 7.0. 2′,5′-dd-3′-ATP and 2′-d-3′-ATP were synthesized as described previously (5Désaubry L.

The previously described synthesis of a family of adenine nucleoside 3′-polyphosphates combined the method of alkoxide activation with the use of tribromoethyl phosphoromorpholino-chloridate as an initial phosphorylating agent (5Désaubry L.

This method was extended for the synthesis of 2′-d-3′-A4P and 2′,5′-dd-3′-A4P by the second stage use of the tributylammonium salt of inorganic triphosphate (Scheme FS1). Although yields for these syntheses were low (8.4 and 12%, respectively), they were sufficient to permit the preparation of research quantities of these 3′-nucleotides. The 3′-tetraphosphates, 2′-d-3′-A4P and 2′,5′-dd-3′-A4P, exhibited notably more potent inhibition of adenylyl cyclase than did the respective 3′-triphosphates (Fig. 1). A comparison of potencies of these nucleotides, determined from several experiments, are given in Table I. The addition of the fourth phosphate increased potency for the 2′-deoxy derivative more than for the 2′,5′-dideoxy derivative, whereas in both cases, the increase in potency was not quite an order of magnitude. With IC50 values of 32 and 106 nm (Table I), respectively, for 2′,5′-dd-3′-ATP and 2′-d-3′-ATP, the 3′-triphosphates exhibited potencies with this rat brain extract similar to those previously reported (6Désaubry L. Shoshani I. Johnson R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14028-14034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The 3′-tetraphosphates exhibited IC50 values of ∼10.5 nm for 2′-d-3′-A4P and ∼7.4 nm for 2′,5′-dd-3′-A4P and K i values of 53 and 23 nm, respectively, making them the most potent known regulators of adenylyl cyclase activity. This inhibition occurred at an estimated enzyme concentration of approximately 0.9 nm, with the assumptions of a mass of 116 kDa and a specific activity of 7 μmol/(min·mg of protein) for the purified type I adenylyl cyclase (14Pfeuffer E. Mollner S. Pfeuffer T. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 3675-3679Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 21Smigel M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 1976-1982Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).

Inhibition was rapid in onset for inhibition by 2′,5′-dd-3′-ATP or by either of two concentrations of 2′,5′-dd-3′-A4P (Fig. 2). As expected from their IC50 values, inhibition by 10 nm2′,5′-dd-3′-A4P elicited an inhibited rate similar to that achieved with 50 nm 2′,5′-dd-3′-ATP; 100 nm2′,5′-dd-3′-ATP almost completely suppressed activity. The lack of lag phase argues for a rapid equilibrium mechanism of interaction of adenosine 3′-polyphosphates with the enzyme. In our previously reported kinetic determinations for inhibition conducted either with adenine nucleosides or with adenine nucleoside 3′-phosphates, inhibition typically conformed to a linear noncompetitive mechanism (5Désaubry L.

By comparison, a linear noncompetitive inhibition was observed with either 3′-tetraphosphate with the enzyme purified from bovine brain, shown in Fig. 4 for 2′,5′-dd-3′-A4P. The noncompetitive character of this inhibition is perhaps more clearly shown with a Hofstee plot (V versus V/S) (Fig. 5). For this plot, a series of parallel lines is expected for straightforward noncompetitive inhibition, whereas intersecting lines would be consistent with competitive inhibition. The reason for the apparent discrepancy in kinetic behavior between adenylyl cyclases in the rat brain and purified bovine brain preparations is not known. It does not lie in nonlinear behavior of the reaction per se (cf. Fig. 2) but likely lies in the complex character of the crude detergent extract or differences in the conformations of the enzymes being tested. Nor was the nonlinear behavior because of an effect of breakdown products of the 3′-tetraphosphates. No significant hydrolysis of either 2′-d-3′-A4P or 2′,5′-dd-3′-A4P was noted during the course of typical adenylyl cyclase incubations (Table II). This lack of hydrolysis, whether enzymatic or nonenzymatic, is consistent with the established stability of both 2′-d-3′-ATP and 2′,5′-dd-3′-ATP that we reported earlier (6Désaubry L. Shoshani I.

Because few adenine nucleotides interact solely with a single protein, the possibility was considered that adenosine 3′-polyphosphates might affect enzymes other than adenylyl cyclase. As an initial investigation in this direction, we tested effects on Na+/K+-ATPase and on two enzymes participating in the cAMP signaling cascade, cAMP phosphodiesterase and cAMP-dependent protein kinase. Under conditions with which strophanthadin exhibited an IC50 of ∼3 μm for inhibition of Na+/K+-ATPase, neither 2′-d-3′-A4P at concentrations ranging from 10 nm to 3.3 μm nor 2′,5′-dd-3′-A4P at concentrations from 10 nm to 11 μm exhibited any effect whatsoever on enzyme activity. Ca2+/calmodulin-sensitive cAMP phosphodiesterase was tested in the absence or presence of 0.7 μm calmodulin, which elicited >3-fold activation of this enzyme preparation. Neither 2′,5′-dd-3′-A4P at concentrations from 0.1 to 10 μm nor 2′,5′-dd-3′-ATP at concentrations from 3 nm to 10 μm had any effect on phosphodiesterase activity, without or with Ca2+/calmodulin.

https://openalex.org/W1591035476,"The nuclear receptors for thyroid hormone (TRs) and retinoic acid (RARs and RXRs) cooperate with the pituitary-specific transcription factor GHF-1 to activate the rat growth hormone (GH) gene. The GH promoter contains a hormone response element (HRE), which binds TR/RXR and RAR/RXR heterodimers, located close to two binding sites for GHF-1. GHF-1 inhibits binding of TR/RXR and RAR/RXR heterodimers to an isolated HRE. Similarly, the receptors inhibit binding of GHF-1 to its cognate site. These results suggest the existence of direct protein to protein interactions between the receptors and the pituitary transcription factor. This was confirmed by in vitro binding studies with GST fusion proteins, which demonstrated a strong association of GHF-1 with RXR and a weaker interaction with RAR and TR. GHF-1 and the receptor heterodimers form a ternary complex with a fragment of the rat GH promoter, which contains binding sites for both, and GHF-1 increases receptor binding to the promoter when present in limiting conditions. These results suggest that the synergistic activation of the rat GH gene involves protein-DNA interactions as well as a physical association between the nuclear receptors and the pituitary-specific transcription factor GHF-1."
https://openalex.org/W1845602991,"In end-stage human heart failure, excessive beta-adrenergic stimulation of the cAMP-dependent signaling pathway due to enhanced endogenous catecholamines is hypothesized to contribute to expressional alterations of myocardial regulatory proteins. The cAMP response element modulator (CREM) regulates the transcription of cAMP-responsive genes and might be involved in the regulation of cardiac gene expression. Using the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, we identified a novel CREM mRNA, CREM-Ib deltaC-X, in the human heart. Overexpression of CREM-Ib deltaC-X decreased cAMP response element (CRE) -mediated gene transcription in HIT-T15 cells, and this activity was assigned to the part of the sequence encoding putative internally translated proteins. Two of three possible internally translated proteins were immunologically identified in cells overexpressing CREM-Ib deltaC-X tagged with the hemagglutinin epitope of the influenza virus. Both proteins were expressed in bacteria and showed CRE-specific DNA binding, formation of heterodimers with the cAMP response element binding protein (CREB), and inhibition of CREB's binding to the CRE. CREM expression was detected on the mRNA and protein levels in the human heart. We conclude that CREM-Ib deltaC-X generates internally translated repressors of CRE-mediated gene transcription, suggesting the first example for the existence and function of human cardiac CREM."

Erythroid Krüppel-like factor (EKLF)1 is a red cell-specific transcription factor that interacts via its three zinc fingers with the essential CACCC element sequence of the mammalian β-globin promoter (1Miller I.J. Bieker J.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2776-2786Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). Similar sequences are present in numerous other erythroid promoters and also within the locus control region located upstream of the β-like globin cluster (2Bieker J.J. Stamatoyannopoulos G. Molecular Biology of Hemoglobin Switching. Intercept Ltd., Andover, UK1994: 231-241Google Scholar). However, EKLF discriminates between the various CACCC elements, forming a particularly strong interaction with the 9-bp sequence (5′CCACACCCT3′) at the adult β-globin promoter (2Bieker J.J. Stamatoyannopoulos G. Molecular Biology of Hemoglobin Switching. Intercept Ltd., Andover, UK1994: 231-241Google Scholar, 3Donze D. Townes T.M. Bieker J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1955-1959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Single point mutations within this CACCC sequence give rise to β-thalassemia in humans and drastically decrease its binding affinity for EKLF (4Feng W.C. Southwood C.M. Bieker J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1493-1500Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The lower affinity of EKLF for the murine embryonic (y)/human fetal (γ) CACCC elements implied that EKLF might play a role in the y−/γ− to β-globin transcriptional switch (3Donze D. Townes T.M. Bieker J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1955-1959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). This prediction was verified by the genetic ablation of EKLF in mice, which leads to a profound β-thalassemia, incomplete definitive erythropoiesis, and embryonic death at the time of the switch (5Nuez B. Michalovich D. Bygrave A. Ploemacher R. Grosveld F. Nature. 1995; 375: 316-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar, 6Perkins A.C. Sharpe A.H. Orkin S.H.

Not only is primitive erythropoiesis unaffected in EKLF-null mice, but embryonic/fetal globin expression is 5-fold higher and remains on longer than in wild type mice (8Perkins A.C. Gaensler K.M.L.

As a result, EKLF is thought to play a major role in consolidation of the switch from embryonic/fetal to adult globin expression. EKLF expression is exquisitely erythroid-specific, as monitored both in cell lines and tissues from adult mice (1Miller I.J. Bieker J.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2776-2786Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). Most vividly, its developmental profile reveals that its onset of expression is strictly limited to the blood islands of the yolk sac at the early head fold stage (day E7.5) and switches by day E9.5 to expression within the hepatic primordia, which becomes the sole source of definitive erythropoiesis by day E12.5 (10Southwood C.M. Downs K.M. Bieker J.J. Dev. Dyn. 1996; 206: 248-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). EKLF expression remains erythroid-specific in the adult, being localized to the red pulp of the spleen and the bone marrow (10Southwood C.M. Downs K.M. Bieker J.J. Dev.

First, EKLF expression remains strictly tissue-specific throughout early development and in the adult. Second, its dual pattern of embryonic expression (i.e. within the yolk sac and fetal liver) makes it an attractive target for these experiments, as these two tissues, although erythropoietic, may regulate expression of their tissue-specific genes by distinct mechanisms. Such considerations arise from experiments that disrupt critically important erythroid genes, yet do not equally affect both primitive and definitive red cell populations (e.g. c-myb (11Mucenski M.L.

Ziegler, personal communication.; and deciphering its regulation may illuminate the initial events in establishment of the erythroid pathway. To understand the regulation of EKLF, we have initiated studies to localize cis-acting sequences important for EKLF expression. Previous analyses had focused on the proximal EKLF promoter and revealed that the GATA site at −60 and the CCAAT element at −45 are important for activity in erythroid cells (21Crossley M. Tsang A.P. Bieker J.J. Orkin S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15440-15444Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The importance of the GATA site was also shown by demonstrating that forced expression of GATA1 could activate the proximal EKLF promoter in non-erythroid cells. However, the present studies use chromatin accessibility as a more global approach to find distal cis-elements that play a role in EKLF transcriptional activation. By using a combination of in vivo transfection and in vitro protein/DNA binding approaches, the present studies have directed us to a distal 49-bp region within an erythroid-specific hypersensitivity domain that, in conjunction with the tissue-specific proximal EKLF promoter, plays a critical role in generating high levels of expression. 32DEpo1 (22Migliaccio G.

CV1 and NIH3T3 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium + 10% fetal bovine serum. The largest EKLF construct (−3 kb) contains the promoter sequence from −2900 to +71 (BamHI to StuI murine genomic fragment (23Jenkins N.A. Gilbert D.J. Copeland N.G. Gruzglin E. Bieker J.J. Mamm. Genome. 1998; 9: 174-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar)) in pBLCAT6 (24Boshart M. Kluppel M. Schmidt A. Schutz G. Luckow B. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 110: 129-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). The −950 construct was made by deleting the BamHI-SacI fragment from the −3-kb construct. The −691 construct was made by deleting theXbaI-ApaI fragment from the −950 construct. The −573 construct was made by digesting the −950 construct withPstI to remove the PstI fragment. The −155 construct was made by deleting the PstI-BstBI fragment from the −573 construct. The Δ−573/−155 construct was made by digesting the −950 construct to completion withBstBI, but only partially with PstI. The second largest band was then isolated (GeneClean) and self-ligated. The Δ−691/−573 construct was made by deleting theApaI-EcoNI fragment from the −950 construct. The Δ−666/−573 construct was made by deleting theSacII-EcoNI fragment from the −950/LBPmut construct (which has the LBP-1 site mutated to a SacII site (see below)). Site-directed mutants were generated by using Transformer Site-directed Mutagenesis Kit (CLONTECH) as recommended by the manufacturer. For GATA (−684), the mutation primer was 5′CCCTACCTGTCGACGGCCTGAAAC3′, which changed the GATA site (GATAGC) to aSalI site (GTCGAC). For LBP-1 (−666), the mutation primer was 5′CGGCCTGAAACCCGCGGTGTGTCTGAT3′, which changed the LBP-1 site (ATCTGG) to a SacII site (CCGCGG). The core mutant mutation primer was 5′CAGAGCTATGGGGTACCTGGGCCCCCGGATCCATAGCGGAATTCAACATCTGGTG3′, with the underlined regions indicating the changes (compare with wild type sequence in Fig. 10). Constructs HS-B to -J were generated by polymerase chain reaction-directed deletion mutagenesis. The oligo primers used for polymerase chain reaction contained a PstI site at the 5′-end and were designed approximately every 20 base pairs beginning at −950 of the EKLF gene: for HS-B, the oligo primer was 5′AACTGCAGCTTCAGCTCCATGCAGTAGCC3′; for HS-C, 5′AACTGCAGCAGTGAGGGTCCTCAGAGCC3′; for HS-D, 5′AACTGCAGCCAGAGTGGGCTGATTTGAGG3′; for HS-E, 5′AACTGCAGGGGACTCCTTTTGCTAAACAGC3′; for HS-F, 5′AACTGCAGGCTCAGACCTCAACACAACAGA3′; for HS-G, 5′AACTGCAGGAGCAATTCAAAGCTAAAATAATTTG3′; for HS-H, 5′AACTGCAGAATTTGTGGCACCAACCCCCAG3′; for HS-I, 5′AACTGCAGAGCTCTTCTGCTCAAGGAGGAA3′; and for HS-J, 5′AACTGCAGACAGAGCTATGGTTGTTCTGGG3′. The oligo primer for the opposite strand strand was 5′CACCCCACCTCCCACAGGACT3′. The vector was prepared by cutting the −950 construct with PstI and isolating the larger vector band (which corresponds to a linearized −573 construct). This vector fragment was then ligated with the desired PstI-digested polymerase chain reaction product. DNA sequences containing the minimal EKLF promoter with mutated GATA or CP-1 sites (21Crossley M. Tsang A.P. Bieker J.J. Orkin S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15440-15444Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were isolated by XbaI-HindIII digestion and ligated to XbaI-HindIII-digested pBLCAT6 vector to form −77, −77/GATAmut, and −77/CP1mut. The constructs EHS1/−77, EHS1/−77/GATAmut, and EHS1/−77/CP1mut were generated by ligating the excised, filled-in PstI fragment (which contains EHS1) from the −950 construct into the filled-inHindIII site of −77, −77/GATAmut, and −77/CP1mut, respectively. About 10832DEpo1 cells were harvested for the preparation of nuclei. After washing with phosphate-buffered saline, cells were incubated with lysis buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 10 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40) for 5 min on ice. The solution was then layered onto lysis buffer that contained 10% sucrose and centrifuged to pellet the nuclei. After one rinse the nuclei were again resuspended in lysis buffer. DNase I digestion was carried out with 1.5 × 107nuclei in DNase I buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 20 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm CaCl2). The amount of DNase I was 0, 0.1, 0.2, 1, 2 units. After incubation at 37 °C for 5 min, stop solution (2% SDS, 25 mm EDTA, 20 μl/ml of 20 mg/ml proteinase K) was added and incubated at 55 °C overnight. After extraction with phenol/chloroform, 300 μg/ml RNase A was added, and the mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. The DNA was precipitated after another phenol/chloroform extraction. The DNA samples were then finally dissolved in TE buffer. The DNA samples for liver and spleen were prepared as described (25Reitman M. Lee E. Westphal H. Felsenfeld G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3990-3998Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The DNA samples were digested with SmaI and were blotted to nitrocellulose (15 μg/lane) using standard procedures (26Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The 5′-end probe was the SmaI-NcoI fragment, and the 3′-end probe was the SacI-SacII fragment from EKLF cDNA (1Miller I.J. Bieker J.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2776-2786Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). 10 μg of CAT reporter and 2 μg of control growth hormone constructs were cotransfected into 1 × 107 32DEpo1 cells by the DEAE-dextran method as described (27Chen X. Bieker J.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5888-5896Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). CV1 and NIH3T3 cells at 40–50% confluence in 100-mm dishes were transfected with 10 μg of CAT reporter and 2 μg of growth hormone control constructs by calcium precipitation (1Miller I.J. Bieker J.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2776-2786Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). Calcium-DNA precipitates were added in media and incubated with cells for 7–8 h in the presence of 0.1 mmchloroquine. After washing, cells were continuously grown for another 35–40 h. CAT assays were carried out as described (27Chen X. Bieker J.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5888-5896Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). For 32DEpo1 cells 80 μg of protein was used, and the incubation time was 2 h at 37 °C. For CV1 and NIH3T3 cells 120 μg of protein was used, and the incubation time was 1 h at 37 °C. The data from multiple experiments were averaged after normalization of CAT activity to growth hormone levels (1Miller I.J. Bieker J.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2776-2786Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar) and are presented as “normalized CAT activity.” Nuclear extracts were prepared from 1 × 109 32DEpo1 cells. All buffers contained 40 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml antipain. After washing with phosphate-buffered saline + 0.35 m sucrose, cells were incubated with buffer A (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl, 10 mm KCl) on ice for 5 min. The cell pellets were then incubated in buffer A + 0.5% Triton on ice for another 5 min and then transferred to TH buffer (15 mmTris, pH 7.4, 0.35 mm sucrose, 60 mm KCl, 15 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm EGTA, 0.15 mm spermidine and 0.5 mm spermine). After spinning, the cell pellet was resuspended and incubated for 30 min on a shaker at 4 °C in buffer C (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 420 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.7 mm EDTA, 25% glycerol). The extracted nuclei were then removed by spinning at 10,000 × g, and the supernatant was dialyzed against buffer D (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 40 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, and 20% glycerol), aliquoted, frozen, and stored at −80 °C. The template for footprint assay was generated by digesting construct HS-G with HindIII, labeling the non-coding with Klenow fragment DNA polymerase, and performing a secondary digestion withEcoNI. The released labeled template was isolated from a 6% polyacrylamide gel by elution, phenol/chloroform extraction, and ethanol precipitation. 20,000 cpm of labeled DNA was mixed with 7.5 or 14 μg 32DEpo1 nuclear protein extract in buffer containing 40 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 110 mm KCl, 10 mmMgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 17% glycerol, and 1 μg of poly(dI)/poly(dC) for each binding reaction in 50 μl. After a 1-h incubation on ice, 50 μl of Mg-Ca buffer (10 mm MgCl2 and 5 mmCaCl2) and 0.4 or 0.8 units of DNase I (for bovine serum albumin-negative control, 0.005 units of DNase I was used) were added to the reaction and incubated for an additional 2 min on ice. The reaction was then stopped by adding 90 μl of stop buffer (1% SDS, 20 mm EDTA, 200 mm NaCl, and 250 μg/ml yeast tRNA). After phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation, samples were dissolved in 6 μl of loading buffer (80% formamide, 45 mm Tris base, 45 mm boric acid, 1 mm EDTA, 0.05% bromphenol blue, and 0.05% xylene cyanol) and analyzed on a 6% sequence gel. The oligonucleotides used for gel shift assays contained HindIII sites at each end and were as follows (“top” strand only is shown; EKLF sequence is underlined): oligo-1, 5′AGCTACAGAGCT3′; oligo-2, 5′AGCTTATGGTTGTTCTGGGCCC3′; oligo-3, 5′AGCTCCCTACCTGA3′; oligo-4, 5′AGCTTAGCGGCCTGAAACA3′. The gel shift assay was performed as described (27Chen X. Bieker J.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5888-5896Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). 2 × 104 cpm of labeled double-stranded oligo and 0.7 μg of nuclear extract were incubated in the same buffer as used for the in vitro footprint assay, then separated on a 6% native polyacrylamide gel. Previously it had been shown that GATA and CP1 sites, located within 90 base pairs of the EKLF transcription initiation site, are important for activity in transient assays (21Crossley M. Tsang A.P. Bieker J.J. Orkin S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15440-15444Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We wished to ascertain whether more distal elements could augment the level of transcriptional activity seen with this minimal promoter. Our approach was to search for DNase-hypersensitive sites surrounding the EKLF transcription unit. Such open structures within chromatin can reveal sites important for enhancing transcription (28Elgin S.C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 19259-19262Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Gross D.S. Garrard W.T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 159-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (967) Google Scholar). We performed these experiments using nuclei from 32DEpo1 cells (22Migliaccio G. Miglicaccio A.R. Broudy V. Kreider B. Rovera G. Adamson J.W. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 833-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 30Kreider B.L. Orkin S.H. Ihle J.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6454-6458Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), which is a murine erythropotential cell line that expresses EKLF, GATA1, and β-globin. As shown in Fig. 1 A, four hypersensitive sites were found, located at approximately −8.0, −0.7, −0.3, and +5.5 kb relative to the transcription initiation site. All four sites were present whether the cells were grown in interleukin 3 or erythropoietin (data not shown). To address which of these were erythroid-specific, we compared the hypersensitive status of the EKLF gene in spleens and livers from an anemic adult mouse. Earlier DNase analysis of these same samples demonstrated that only the spleen exhibits hypersensitive sites at the β-globin locus control region (25Reitman M. Lee E. Westphal H. Felsenfeld G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3990-3998Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The analyses at the EKLF promoter (Fig. 1 B) demonstrate that only the two sites closest to the initiation site (at −0.7 and −0.3 kb) are erythroid-specific; the other sites (at −8.0 and +5.5 kb) are present in both tissues. The two erythroid-specific sites will be referred to as EKLF-hypersensitive sites 1 and 2 (EHS1 at −0.7 kb, and EHS2 at −0.3 kb). These sites allow us to conclude that the EKLF transcription unit resides in a more open chromatin structure in erythroid cells and also direct us to two distal locations within the promoter that may account for its tissue-specific expression. To localize important EKLF promoter regions, we compared the upstream sequences of the murine (23Jenkins N.A. Gilbert D.J. Copeland N.G. Gruzglin E. Bieker J.J. Mamm. Genome. 1998; 9: 174-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) and human (31Bieker J.J. DNA Cell Biol. 1996; 15: 347-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) EKLF genomic transcription units via a matrix analysis. Analysis of conserved regions has been helpful in localizing functional elements, for example the mouse and human locus control regions (32Moon A.M. Ley T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 7693-7697Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 33Hug B.A. Moon A.M. Ley T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 5771-5778Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Analysis of ∼800 nucleotides from the human promoter compared with ∼1 kb of the murine promoter (Fig. 2) reveals that two discrete regions show extensive sequence conservation. The proximal region extends to approximately −90 and includes the GATA and CP1 sites described earlier (21Crossley M. Tsang A.P. Bieker J.J. Orkin S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15440-15444Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, the other region retains significant similarity for ∼300 nucleotides and precisely overlaps the upstream erythroid-specific EKLF-hypersensitive site, EHS1. We began the functional analyses by addressing whether a murine EKLF promoter construct, which contains 3 kb of upstream sequence, imparts high levels of expression upon a simple CAT reporter gene that contains no other basal promoter sequence (pBLCAT6 (24Boshart M. Kluppel M. Schmidt A. Schutz G. Luckow B. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 110: 129-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar)). As both of the erythroid-specific hypersensitive sites are within this fragment, we started our analyses with this construct and tested derived deletions via transient assays into 32DEpo1 cells (Fig. 3). Deletion to −950 has no effect, indicating that sequences beyond the hypersensitive sites are not important for promoter activity. However, deletion to −573, which removes EHS1 alone, results in a drastic (∼20-fold) decrease in CAT activity. Removal of EHS2 alone (Δ−573/−155) yields a slight (∼50%) increase in activity. Removal of both EHS1 and EHS2 (the −155 construct) decreases activity similar to the single EHS1 deletion but, consistent with earlier experiments (21Crossley M. Tsang A.P. Bieker J.J. Orkin S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15440-15444Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), does not abolish it. We conclude that EHS1, a conserved locus that exhibits erythroid-specific hypersensitivity, is critical for imparting high level transcription upon the adjacent EKLF gene. Given that expression of the EKLF promoter is erythroid-specific, we tested whether the EHS1 element would impart this property upon a heterologous promoter by fusing it to the thymidine kinase (tk) promoter in ptkCAT (pBLCAT5 (24Boshart M. Kluppel M. Schmidt A. Schutz G. Luckow B. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 110: 129-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar)). The tk promoter is already active (normalized to a value of 1 in each cell line for comparison across cell lines), but its level is boosted 20–30-fold when fused to EHS1, regardless of cell type (Fig. 4 A) and orientation (data not shown). The EHS1 fragment thus appears to behave as a non-tissue-specific enhancer element. However, fusion of this element to the minimal EKLF promoter, which bears no sequence similarity to the tk promoter, was sufficient to regenerate the tissue-specific expression exhibited by the complete 3-kb construct and the −950 construct (Fig. 4 B). We conclude that tissue-specific reporter expression requires the proximal EKLF promoter but that its high level expression additionally requires the EHS1 element. The proximal EKLF element is highly conserved in mammalian cells (Fig. 2), including the GATA and CP1 elements. We asked how alteration of these sequences would affect the ability of EHS1 to boost transcription. By using the minimal EKLF promoter construct (−77 nucleotides), we found that mutation of either site disrupted reporter levels (Fig. 5 A), as previously observed (21Crossley M. Tsang A.P. Bieker J.J. Orkin S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15440-15444Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When EHS1 was fused to each of these constructs, all were significantly boosted (Fig. 5 A). However, when normalized to their respective non-EHS1-containing values (Fig. 5 B), it became clear that the GATA mutation had the most severe effect on enhancement, being boosted only ∼6-fold compared with a boost of ∼20-fold for the wild type and CP1 mutant. We conclude that the proximal GATA site is essential not only for minimal promoter activity but also for optimal EHS1 activity. On the other hand, the CP1 site, although important for EKLF promoter activity, is not essential for EHS1 activation. We next focused our attention on the distal EHS1 enhancer element. Inspection of the sequence surrounding the −0.7-kb EHS1 indicated that it contains conserved GATA- (at −684) and LBP (at −666) (34Jones K.A. Luciw P.A. Duchange N. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 1101-1114Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar)-binding sites. The importance of these sites was tested by directed mutagenesis, and the results indicate that their disruption had no effect on the activity of EHS1 (Fig. 6 A). We then tested an extensive series of deletion mutants, starting at the 5′-end with the fully active −950 construct (Fig. 6 B). Sequential deletions of approximately 20 base pairs to −715 had no discernible effect (constructs HS-B to -J), but deletion to −691 significantly disrupted transactivation, approaching the low level seen with the −573 deletion. Two internal deletions then allowed us to localize the 3′-boundary of this element (Fig. 6 C). Deletion of sequences from the LBP site to the −573 boundary (Δ−666/−573) had no effect on transactivation. However, a slightly larger deletion up to −691 (Δ−691/−573) decreased activity to the level seen with the 5′-directed −691 deletion. These analyses suggest that full EHS1 activity is localized to the 49-bp sequence between −715 and −666 of the EKLF promoter. We used in vitro assays to determine which region(s) within the 49-bp sequence interact with DNA-binding proteins in extracts from 32DEpo1 cells. DNase footprint analysis with a 250-bp fragment from EHS1 revealed that DNase protection overlaps the 49-bp sequence of interest (Fig. 7), giving rise to regions of both decreased access and hypersensitivity to the nuclease. These were grouped into four footprints (FP1, FP2, FP3, and FP4; Fig. 7) bound by regions of nuclease insensitivity. Note that FP1 extends beyond the 5′-boundary (−715) of the 49-base pair sequence and that the unimportant GATA site (−684) separates FP3 and FP4. By juxtaposing the in vitro nuclease protection and in vivo deletion data (in Figs. 6 and 7), we designed four specific oligonucleotides and tested their ability to bind proteins in the 32DEpo1 extract (Fig. 8). The 5′-most sequence (oligo 1) did not bind any protein; this was not surprising as this sequence contained only half of FP1. However, the adjacent three sequences (oligos 2–4) yielded a simple pattern of interaction, each with its own single species"

PDI is a 57-kDa protein present in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of eukaryotes. The protein is organized in an abb′a′c domain structure where thea and b domains are structurally related to thioredoxin and the c domain is rich in acidic amino acid residues (1Kemmink J. Darby N.J. Dijkstra K. Nilges M. Creighton T.E. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 239-245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 2Darby N.J. Kemmink J. Creighton T.E.

Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2587-2593Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The catalytic activity of PDI resides in thea and a′ domains, where the catalytically active cysteine residues are found in a WCGHCK motif in each domain. In each active site the two cysteines cycle between a reduced and an oxidized state, enabling the enzyme to exchange reducing equivalents with substrate sulfhydryls. PDI is capable of catalyzing several kinds of disulfide reactions: 1) oxidation reactions, in which the intramolecular disulfide bond of the CGHC motif is transferred to a pair of sulfhydryls in a substrate, 2) isomerization reactions in which disulfides are rearranged via the formation of a transient, mixed disulfide between the first cysteine residue of the CGHC motif and the substrate (5Darby N.J. Creighton T.E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16770-16780Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), and 3) reduction of mixed disulfides, in which PDI catalyzes the reductive cleavage of a disulfide bond (6Nakamura S. Matsushima M. Song H. Kikuchi M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1996; 120: 525-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 7Hayano T. Inaka K. Otsu M. Taniyama Y. Miki K. Matsushima M. Kikuchi M.

PDI has been studied in detail in vitro with a variety of polypeptide substrates such as bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor, insulin, lysozyme, and ribonuclease A (RNase) (recently reviewed by Ruddon and Bedows (45Ruddon R.W. Bedows E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3125-3128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) and Creighton (46Creighton T.E. Biol. Chem. 1997; 378: 731-744PubMed Google Scholar)). The reactivation of “scrambled” RNase (sRNase) is the classic assay for measuring PDI activity (9Givol D. De Lorenzo F. Goldberger R.F. Anfinsen C.B. Biochemistry. 1965; 53: 676-685Google Scholar). Oxidation of reduced RNase in urea results in non-native pairing of the sulfhydryl groups, giving the inactive RNase derivative, sRNase. The conversion to the native protein requires the presence of a thiol reagent, and the process is catalyzed by PDI (9Givol D. De Lorenzo F. Goldberger R.F. Anfinsen C.B. Biochemistry. 1965; 53: 676-685Google Scholar, 10Ruoppolo M. Lundstrom-Ljung J. Talamo F. Pucci P. Marino G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12259-12267Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 11Goldberger R.F. Epstein C.J. Anfinsen C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 1406-1410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In most in vitro studies of PDI, activity has been investigated using a redox-buffer containing reduced and oxidized glutathione; GSH and GSSG, respectively. In the ER, the active site cysteine residue of PDI presumably reacts with endogenous glutathione, which is present in mm amounts with a [GSH]/[GSSG] ratio in the range 1–3 (12Hwang C. Sinskey A.J. Lodish H.F. Science. 1992; 257: 1496-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (1605) Google Scholar). Similarly, the redox state of PDI is also determined by the relative levels of GSH and GSSG in most in vitro assays. The likely mechanism of the catalysis of disulfide bond formation involves the transfer of an active site disulfide bond from PDI to the substrate via a PDI-substrate disulfide intermediate (2Darby N.J. Kemmink J. Creighton T.E. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10517-10528Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). PDI cycles between reduced and oxidized states and the re-oxidation of the reduced PDI by GSSG limits the overall reaction rate in vitro (2Darby N.J. Kemmink J. Creighton T.E. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10517-10528Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 13Darby N.J. Creighton T.E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3576-3587Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). This suggests that GSSG is a poor substrate of PDI. New evidence suggests that the yeast ERO1gene product is required for oxidation of protein thiols in the ER. Loss of Ero1p function results in the accumulation of proteins whose folding is dependent upon disulfide bond formation. Together, these observations argue that Ero1p in vivo may be directly responsible of reoxidation of PDI (14Pollard M.G. Travers K.J. Weissman J.S. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 171-182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar, 15Frand A.R. Kaiser C.A. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 161-170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). Even though the nature of PDI and its substrate binding has been investigated in various ways (16Klappa P. Hawkins H.C. Freedman R.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 248: 37-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 17Morjana N.A. Gilbert H.F.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 927-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar), little is known about the specificity of PDI in catalysis of disulfide rearrangement and redox reactions. This, and the lack of small, well defined substrates with high affinity for PDI prompted us to carry out the present study. In analogy with substrates of proteolytic enzymes (21Meldal M. Shmuel C. Combinatorial Peptide Libraries. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1998: 51-82Google Scholar), a fluorescent and internally quenched disulfide-linked library of peptides (22Spetzler J.C. Westphal V. Winther J.R. Meldal M. J. Pept. Sci. 1998; 4: 128-137Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was used to identify a series of heptameric peptides that are extremely sensitive substrates of PDI. A surprisingly high degree of similarity was found in the amino acid sequences identified by screening the library of peptides on resin beads. Human PDI (hPDI) favored substrates containing the following features: small/helix breaker-cysteine-X-hydrophobic/basic-hydrophobic. A quantitative kinetic characterization was carried out by measuring the time-dependent change in fluorescence due to reduction of soluble substrates by hPDI. This analysis suggests a higher degree of specificity of hPDI than previously anticipated. The main difference between the substrates was seen for the dissociation constant, which showed a 10-fold difference. This indicates that the specificity of hPDI is primarily determined by the association between enzyme and substrate rather than catalytic effectiveness. The gene encoding hPDI was a cDNA clone isolated by K. Kivirikko (University of Oulu, Oulu, Finland). hPDI was purified from the Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) carrying the plasmid pET12a-PDI2 (23Darby N.J. Creighton T.E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11725-11735Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Five hours after induction with isopropyl–1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 30 °C, the cells were harvested and resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT). The cell suspension was sonicated 3 × 30 s/0.5 liter culture. After centrifugation, ammonium sulfate was added to the supernatant to 25% saturation and centrifuged at 10000 × g for 20 min. Additional ammonium sulfate was added to the supernatant to 100% saturation, and the precipitated protein was recovered by centrifugation. The pellet was dissolved in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 1 mm EDTA and the cleared extract was dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 1 mm EDTA. After dialysis, NaCl was added to the sample to a final concentration of 1m and the sample was applied to an Octyl-Sepharose column equilibrated with 1 m NaCl in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 1 mm EDTA. After a wash with 1 m NaCl in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 1 mm EDTA, the protein was eluted in one step with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8),1 mm EDTA. This resulted in more than 80% pure hPDI estimated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The hPDI was further purified by applying the dialyzed sample to a Mono Q ion exchange column equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 1 mm EDTA and was subsequently eluted with a linear gradient from 0.1 to 0.5 m NaCl in the same buffer. The hPDI eluted at ∼0.3 m NaCl and was at least 95% pure, estimated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The pooled fractions were dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 1 mmEDTA and stored frozen at −80 °C until use. The concentration of hPDI was determined using an absorbance coefficient of 56399 cm−1m−1 (23Darby N.J. Creighton T.E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11725-11735Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The yield was approximately 5 mg/0.5 liter culture. The hPDI used in the reduction assays was reduced by adding 10-fold molar excess of DTT. The sample was incubated in an argon atmosphere for at least 20 min at room temperature before removal of the DTT on a NAP-5 column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) 1 mm EDTA. The total sulfhydryl content of hPDI was determined by Ellman's reaction (24Ellman G.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1959; 82: 70-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (21604) Google Scholar, 25Riddles P.W. Blakeley R.L. Zerner B. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 91: 49-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (1073) Google Scholar). Between 3.3 and 3.9 free cysteines were found per molecule of hPDI. Two peptides linked by an interchain disulfide bond, a fluorescent probe, and a quencher group were synthesized as described (22Spetzler J.C. Westphal V. Winther J.R. Meldal M. J. Pept. Sci. 1998; 4: 128-137Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Meldal M. Breddam K. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 195: 141-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The library was synthesized on 100–300-μm polyethylene glycol-poly-N,N-dimethyl acrylamide copolymer (PEGA) beads (from Polymer Laboratories, UK) for libraries (27Renil, M., Ferreras, M., Delaisse, J. M., Foged, N. T., and Meldal, M. (1998) J. Pept. Sci., in pressGoogle Scholar) using the split synthesis method ensuring an unique peptide on each bead (28Lam K.S. Salmon S.E. Hersh E.M. Hruby V.J. Kazmierski W.M. Knapp R.J. Nature. 1991; 354: 82-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (1743) Google Scholar, 29Meldal M. Methods. 1994; 6: 417-424Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The library consists of a cysteine residue flanked by random amino acid residues and the fluorescento-aminobenzoyl (Abz) group at the amino-terminal of the peptide. All 20 natural amino acids except cysteine were employed in the library. Cysteine was omitted in the random amino acid (Xaa) pool in order to avoid nonspecific disulfide bridge formation. This peptide was coupled to a peptide containing a constant amino acid sequence and the quenching group, 3-nitrotyrosine (Tyr(NO2)). The peptide library has been described in detail (22Spetzler J.C. Westphal V. Winther J.R. Meldal M. J. Pept. Sci. 1998; 4: 128-137Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The bead-linked peptide library was analyzed under an Optical Star fluorescence microscope with a 320-nm band pass filter for the excitation and a 410-nm filter for the detection of emitted light. Approximately 30,000 PEGA beads (∼1000 beads at a time) containing the peptides (∼50 pmol of peptide/bead corresponding to 1 mm concentration) were incubated in a nitrogen atmosphere at room temperature in a 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 1 mm EDTA buffer with ∼1.0 mm GSH for 3 h. After treatment with GSH, some beads particularly susceptible to uncatalyzed reduction became fluorescent and were removed and defined as false positive. The rest of the beads were incubated under the same conditions with catalytic amounts of hPDI (0.2 μm), and the beads that turned fluorescent within 1 h were collected. These beads were washed with DTT in order to completely reduce the substrate so only the random peptide chain remained attached to the bead. This peptide was re-coupled with the Tyr(NO2)-containing peptide via a disulfide bond (22Spetzler J.C. Westphal V. Winther J.R. Meldal M. J. Pept. Sci. 1998; 4: 128-137Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the procedure was repeated. Beads in the original screen that were not fluorescent after 3 days were also collected in order to identify poor substrates for hPDI. The amino acid sequence of peptides on individual beads was determined directly using a protein sequencer (model 470A) from Applied Biosystems. As a control, the peptides from two pools of 2000 beads were sequenced collectively. This showed, as expected, that all amino acids except cysteine were present at about equal amounts at each position in the library (data not shown), confirming that the library was random. Soluble peptide substrates were synthesized as described previously (22Spetzler J.C. Westphal V. Winther J.R. Meldal M. J. Pept. Sci. 1998; 4: 128-137Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The reduction of internally quenched disulfide-linked substrates was measured as a function of time using a Perkin-Elmer Luminescence Spectrometer LS50B with excitation at 320 nm and emission at 420 nm. The excitation and emission slit widths were 15 nm each. The assay was performed at 25 °C in a 3-ml 1 × 1-cm quartz cuvette from Hellma using a thermostated, stirred single-cell holder. Complete mixing of the sample was achieved in approximately 1 s. The buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 1 mm EDTA) was filtered and purged with argon, and the assays were performed in an argon atmosphere in order to avoid uncontrolled re-oxidation. Soluble peptide substrates were synthesized as described (22Spetzler J.C. Westphal V. Winther J.R. Meldal M. J. Pept. Sci. 1998; 4: 128-137Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and purified by semi-preparative reverse phase high performanc liquid chromatography to more than 98% purity as determined by amino acid analysis. The substrate concentrations were determined by amino acid analysis, and confirmed by titration with reduced hPDI as follows: Reduced hPDI with known active site concentration,c PDI (approximately 6 nm), was added to a surplus of substrate (100–300 nm) and the increase in fluorescence was measured. When all the reducing equivalents from hPDI were transferred to the substrate, the change in intensity of fluorescence corresponding to the amount of reduced substrate was determined (ΔF PDI). Total reduction of the substrate was obtained by addition of DTT (10 mm final concentration) (ΔF total). The substrate concentration [S]0 is obtained from: [S]0 =c PDIΔF total/ΔF PDI Solutions of the substrates (1 mm) were made in N, N-dimethylformamide and further diluted to 10 μm in water. The amount of N, N-dimethylformamide in the assay (<0.5%) did not affect the activity of hPDI (data not shown). The substrate concentrations were in the range 10–500 nm, and the concentration of reduced hPDI was 3 nm. The buffer and substrate were mixed in the cuvette before the addition of reduced hPDI. The rate of reduction was determined by the increase in fluorescence as a function of time. In each experiment the reduction of the substrate was followed for at least 600 s. The background fluorescence signal caused by the buffer and the non-reduced substrate was small and constant during the time course of the assay. In all cases, Equation 1, given under “Results,” described a satisfying fit to the measured data. The concentration dependence of the kinetic parameters,k obs and F ∞, obtained from fits of Equation 1, using the program Kaleidagraph (Synergy Software Ltd.), were further analyzed. As expected, allF ∞ values were similar (data not shown), whereas k obs showed a non-linear dependence on the concentrations. To develop a simple quantitative assay for investigating hPDI activity and substrate preference, we tested the following simple notions: (a) Tyr(NO2) would quench the fluorescent probe Abz when these groups were placed in individual peptides linked by a disulfide bond, and (b) reduction of the disulfide bond would result in a significance increase in the fluorescence yield. A model substrate (VW0s), composed of two peptide chains linked by a disulfide bond, was synthesized as described in Ref. 22Spetzler J.C. Westphal V. Winther J.R. Meldal M. J. Pept. Sci. 1998; 4: 128-137Crossref PubMed Google Scholar (Fig. 1). We found that VW0s was readily reduced by DTT, giving a 20-fold increase in fluorescence. This indicated that the system could in principle be used as a sensitive tool to study the reduction of disulfide bonds. However, the model substrate was not easily reduced by hPDI and therefore not a sensitive substrate of hPDI. In order to identify a better substrate of hPDI, an immobilized fluorescence-quenched peptide library was generated by the split synthesis method to obtain one peptide compound per bead (28Lam K.S. Salmon S.E. Hersh E.M. Hruby V.J. Kazmierski W.M. Knapp R.J. Nature. 1991; 354: 82-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (1743) Google Scholar). Like the compound VW0s, each consisted of two peptides linked together by a disulfide bond: one, with the sequence Abz-Gly-Xaa-Cys-Xaa-Xaa-Xaa-Met, synthesized on a methionine residue linked to the resin bead. Xaa indicates an amino acid residue except cysteine, varying from bead to bead. The other peptide contained the sequence Ala-Tyr(NO2)-Cys-Ala-NH2 (22Spetzler J.C. Westphal V. Winther J.R. Meldal M. J. Pept. Sci. 1998; 4: 128-137Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 2 A). This relatively small peptide chain was chosen as the non-random quenching peptide chain because VW0s, containing a similar sequence, was an extremely poor substrate. This ensured that the hPDI specificity would be mainly dependent on the random amino acid chain. Beads containing suitable substrates quickly showed fluorescence when treated with reduced hPDI (Fig. 2 B). These beads were picked up under a stereo microscope, completely reduced, washed, and the amino acid sequence determined (Table I). Thirteen peptides were picked up as fluorescent beads within 1 h, 2 were collected the next day, and finally 2 peptides were picked up as being non-fluorescent after 3 days of incubation with reduced hPDI (Table I).Table IThe amino acid sequences obtained by sequence analysis of substrates attached to resin beads collected by screening of the fluorescent peptide libraryAbz C3Gly C2Xaa C1CysXaa C1′Xaa C2′Xaa C3′Met C4′VW1AbzGlySerCysThrPheIleMetVW3AbzGlyAlaCysMetLysValMetVW4AbzGlyIleCys?AlaTyrMetVW6AbzGlyAlaCysThrMet?MetVW7AbzGlySerCys?Lys?MetVW10AbzGlyGlyCysMetAlaLeuMetVW11AbzGlyProCysAsn?AspMetVW18AbzGlyGlyCysLeuLysLeuMetVW19AbzGlyProCysIleLysLeuMetVW20AbzGlyArgCysValMetGluMetVW21AbzGlyProCysAlaArgSerMetVW23AbzGlyGlyCysPheLysProMetVW24AbzGlyLeuCysProHisLeuMetVW17AbzGlyTyrCysSerGlyHisMetVW22AbzGlyIleCysAsnIleThrMetVW30AbzGlyIleCysTrpTrpTrpMetVW31AbzGlyTyrCysPheTrpMetMetThe first 13 sequences were coupled to beads that were picked up within the first hour of incubation with reduced hPDI.VW17 and VW22 were picked up the following day as fluorescent beads.Beads containing VW30 and VW31 did not react upon treatment with reduced hPDI.A question mark in the sequence indicates that the residue could not be identified during the sequencing. Open table in a new tab The first 13 sequences were coupled to beads that were picked up within the first hour of incubation with reduced hPDI. VW17 and VW22 were picked up the following day as fluorescent beads. Beads containing VW30 and VW31 did not react upon treatment with reduced hPDI. A question mark in the sequence indicates that the residue could not be identified during the sequencing. When we inspected the first 13 sequences in Table I, certain amino acid residues seemed to be over-represented at certain positions. The first substrates to fluoresce had an over-representation of helix-breakers (such as proline and glycine) and small amino acid residues at the C1 position. 2To facilitate the discussion of substrate preference we wish to introduce a nomenclature similar to that of protease substrates; C1 and C1′ indicate the residues directly NH2- and COOH-proximal, respectively, to the cysteine residue engaged in disulfide bond formation. The subscripts indicate the distances of the residues from the cysteine residue.There is an even distribution between non-polar and polar residues, but only one basic amino acid residue, an Arg in VW20. The hydropathy index (30Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (17279) Google Scholar) is varying widely around zero, suggesting that it does not matter whether the amino acid residue is hydrophobic or not. Although there does not seem to be a preference for any particular amino acid at the C1′ position, a hydrophobic residue is found in more than 70% of the sequences. This tendency is reflected in an average hydropathy index of 1.3. At the C2′ position, on the contrary, there is a preference for basic amino acid residues. Seven sequences, among the first group of substrates, contain an amino acid residue with a basic side chain, whereas the remaining five all have a hydrophobic amino acid residue. The average hydropathy index is −1.4, indicating a tendency to favor polar side chains. There are five lysine residues present at the C2′ position, and the probability that this is a coincidence is less than 1%. The C3′ position is the only one in which amino acids containing acidic side chains are found, but the position is dominated by hydrophobic amino acid residues. However, because of the strongly hydrophilic amino acid residues, aspartate and glutamate, the average hydropathy index is only 1.2. Even though aromatic amino acid residues are present in some of the preferred substrates, it is striking that the two substrates that were not reduced after 3 days of incubation with reduced hPDI, VW30 and VW31, contain a large number of aromatic residues. These two substrates were, however, easily reduced and were fluorescent after treatment with DTT. The most plausible reason for the lack of hPDI-mediated reduction of these substrates is that the amino acid residues, containing fairly bulky side chains, cause steric hindrance, making the disulfide bond between the two peptides inaccessible to hPDI. Screening of the library allowed the identification of good substrates, but it gave only a qualitative impression of substrate specificity. To obtain a more quantitative measure for the activity of hPDI, we synthesized selected substrates in soluble form as described previously (22Spetzler J.C. Westphal V. Winther J.R. Meldal M. J. Pept. Sci. 1998; 4: 128-137Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These disulfidelinked peptide substrates turned out to be extremely sensitive to reduction by reduced hPDI. The reaction of the substrates with DTT was investigated under pseudofirst-order conditions using various concentrations of DTT (100 - 500 μm) and a fixed concentration of substrate (40 nm). All substrates showed the same second order rate constant in the DTT reduction (k DTT = 5.3 ± 0.6 s−1m−1) (data not shown). Figs. 3 and 4 show the reduction of substrate by reduced hPDI, as increase in fluorescence plotted against time. The time course for reduction of substrate VW6s by 2.5–3.0 nm hPDI at three different substrate concentrations, 15, 75, and 430 nm (Fig. 3, panels A, B, and C, respectively), is shown. When looking at three different substrates, VW1s, VW17s, and VW19s, all at 100 nm, it is clear that the reduction of the substrates by hPDI (3 nm) occurs at different rates (Fig. 4). Since the substrate concentration is in large excess as compared with enzyme concentration, we make the approximation that the substrate concentration is constant throughout the reaction. The reaction is therefore approximated to a pseudofirst-order. Thesolid lines shown in Figs. 3 and 4 represent fits to Equation 1.F(t)=F∞(1−exp(−kobs·t))(Eq. 1) Here, k obs is the observed first-order rate constant, and F(t) is the intensity of fluorescence at time t. F(t) attains the value F ∞ at the end of the reaction.Figure 4Reaction of reduced hPDI with three different substrates, using 100 nm of each substrate. Thecurves represent the increase in fluorescence from reduction of the substrate after addition of 3 nm reduced hPDI. The background from buffer and unreduced substrate was subtracted. The insets show the length of the experiments from which the fitting parameters (using Equation 1) were obtained. The fit is shown by the solid line.

Nevertheless, employing Equation 1 to the data set resulted in a reasonable fit even at substrate concentrations only 5 times larger than enzyme concentrations (Fig. 3 A). The usual kinetic parameters of a Michaelis-Menten equation do not apply to this system since hPDI is added in the reduced form and is oxidized upon reaction with substrate. The system is therefore not a classic enzyme-substrate system, but can be described by presteady-state kinetics. The dependence of the first-order rate constant,k obs, on the concentration of the substrate [S]0 obtained by fitting the data to Equation 1 is shown in Fig. 5. The hyperbolic pattern of k obs with [S]0 for most of the substrates is not in agreement with a simple one-step mechanism (Reaction 1), which would have implied a linear dependence of k obs on the substrate concentration,i.e. k obs = k 1[S]0 +k −1 (31Olsen K.

https://openalex.org/W1932078369,"Recent findings have led to changes in the traditional concept of nerve recovery, including the realization that injured nerves, like any other injured tissue, need the assistance of blood-derived cells and factors in order to heal. We show that factor XIIIa (FXIIIa, the potentially active a2subunit of factor XIII), an enzyme that participates in blood coagulation by stabilizing the fibrin clot, is also active in the nervous system where it may play a key role in the healing of injured tissue. We demonstrate that the plasma, macrophages and nerves of fish contain a 55 kDa form of transglutaminase that cross-reacts immunologically with the a-subunit of FXIII in mammals (80 kDa). The fish enzyme in the plasma, unlike its mammalian counterpart, is active, pointing to a difference in control of the coagulation pathway in the two species. Analysis of FXIIIa expression in mammalian neural tissues and their response to injury revealed high levels of the enzyme in media conditioned by peripheral nerves as compared with medium conditioned by nerves of the central nervous system. Furthermore, similarity was observed in the postinjury behavior of FXIIIa in regenerating nerve tissues (peripheral nervous system of mammals and the central nervous system of fish). We suggest that the postinjury level of factor XIIIa in the nervous system may be related to the tissue's regenerative capacity, and that FXIIIa may therefore be a link underlying a possible association between the processes of blood coagulation and nerve healing."
https://openalex.org/W1979520023,"JE is a member of the family of “immediate early” genes induced by growth factors and cytokines.JE encodes a low molecular weight secretory glycoprotein analogous to the human monocyte chemoattractant protein, MCP-1. JE and MCP-1 proteins are thought to play an important role in inflammation and in the recruitment of monocyte/macrophages to the vessel wall during the development of atherosclerosis. We have previously reported that the induction of JE in rat aortic smooth muscle cells (SMC) was specific to platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and was not seen with other growth agonists. Using a luciferase reporter system and transient transfection assays of rat aortic SMC, we now report the identification of a region in the proximal rat JE promoter that is responsive to PDGF but not to other growth factors (angiotensin II and α-thrombin) or cytokines (interleukin 1-β and tumor necrosis factor-α). The full response to PDGF (∼6-fold) requires the cooperative activity of two potentially novel cis-acting elements, at positions −146 to −128 and −84 to −59. While each element produces a different pattern in electrophoretic mobility shift assays, they appear to bind the same PDGF-responsive species. Further analysis of these regions should provide important insights into PDGF-specific responses in vascular SMC.

Growth and migration of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC)1 are critical events in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, hypertension, and angiogenesis (1Ross R. Nature. 1993; 362: 801-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (9925) Google Scholar). VSMC exhibit two types of growth: hyperplasia, characterized by increased DNA and protein synthesis as well as cell division, and hypertrophy, characterized by increased cell size and protein content without DNA synthesis or cell division (2Owens G.K. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 257: H1755-H1765PubMed Google Scholar). VSMC hyperplasia is an important feature of atherogenesis and involves the migration of VSMC from the vessel media to the intima and the proliferation of medial and intimal VSMC (1Ross R. Nature. 1993; 362: 801-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (9925) Google Scholar). VSMC hypertrophy is more typical of the vascular response to chronic hypertension, although hyperplasia is seen in hypertension as well (2Owens G.K. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 257: H1755-H1765PubMed Google Scholar). The growth responses of cultured VSMC appear to be agonist-specific. In adult rat aortic VSMC, platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and serum induce hyperplasia (3Ross R. Raines E.W. Bowen-Pope D.F.

Res. 1992; 70: 314-325Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). While numerous agents have been shown to have monocyte chemotactic activity, JE/MCP-1 appears to account for all of the monocyte chemotactic activity secreted by cultured rat (27Poon M. Hsu W.C. Zhang H. Bogdanov V.Y. Taubman M.B. Am. J. Pathol. 1996; 149: 307-317PubMed Google Scholar) and human (28Cushing S.D. Berliner J.A. Valente A.J. Territo M.C. Navab M. Parhami F. Gerrity R.

JE/MCP-1 may thus play a particularly important role in SMC-mediated monocyte recruitment during the development of atherosclerosis and in acute vessel injury (29Schwartz C.J. Valente A.J. Sprague E.A. Kelley J.L. Nerem R.M. Clin. Cardiol. 1991; 14: 11-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar).We have previously examined the expression of JE mRNA and protein in rat aortic SMC (19Taubman M.B. Rollins B.J. Poon M. Marmur J. Green R.S. Berk B.C. Nadal-Ginard B. Circ. Res. 1992; 70: 314-325Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to other cell types, where the induction of JE mRNA is common to a variety of growth agonists, the induction of JE mRNA and chemotactic activity in rat aortic SMC was specific to calf serum and PDGF and was not seen with other agonists, including Ang or α-thrombin (19Taubman M.B. Rollins B.J. Poon M. Marmur J. Green R.S. Berk B.C. Nadal-Ginard B. Circ. Res. 1992; 70: 314-325Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the induction of JE mRNA by PDGF appears to be independent of activation of protein kinase C, mobilization of intracellular calcium, or stimulation of the Na+-H+ exchanger, signals shared by Ang and PDGF and often involved in the induction of immediate early genes in SMC (19Taubman M.B. Rollins B.J. Poon M. Marmur J. Green R.S. Berk B.C. Nadal-Ginard B. Circ. Res. 1992; 70: 314-325Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Accordingly, we have employed the rat JE gene as a model system for identifying potential pathways that differentiate the response to Ang and PDGF. We now report the identification of two sites in the rat JE promoter that act synergistically to regulateJE transcription in a PDGF-specific manner. These sites do not include previously identified PDGF-responsive elements and therefore may be part of a novel PDGF-specific pathway. Such pathways may be involved in differentiating the hypertrophic and hyperplastic phenotypes.DISCUSSIONPrevious studies from this laboratory have demonstrated that the accumulation of JE mRNA and the induction of chemotactic activity in rat aortic SMC is specific for PDGF and is not induced by a variety of other growth factors or cytokines known to be active in these cells (27Poon M. Hsu W.C. Zhang H. Bogdanov V.Y. Taubman M.B. Am. J. Pathol. 1996; 149: 307-317PubMed Google Scholar). This paper describes the first analysis of theJE promoter in SMC and reports the identification of a PDGF-responsive area (−146 to −59) in the proximal rat JEpromoter. In addition, it demonstrates that this area has high specificity for PDGF and suggests that this may be responsible for the PDGF-specific accumulation of JE mRNA seen in rat SMC.The full response to PDGF (∼6-fold) appears to require the cooperative activity of two cis-acting elements at positions −146 to −128 (element 1) and −84 to −59 (element 2). Either element alone is sufficient to confer PDGF-specific inducibility on a luciferase reporter construct, although the level of luciferase activity is ∼50% of that seen with constructs containing both elements. Element 1 has no activity in the antisense orientation when placed immediately upstream of element 2 or when placed upstream of the AP-1-like site in the absence of element 2. Its ability to confer full activity to element 2-containing constructs thus appears to be dependent upon its position and orientation.Element 2 generates two major bands on EMSA. The amount of the slower moving species does not change significantly in response to PDGF, suggesting that the observed DNA-protein interaction is constitutive. In contrast, a faster moving species appears rapidly in response to PDGF but not Ang. As suggested by the deletion analyses, this species is likely to be of paramount importance in the PDGF-specific induction of JE. Element 1 also binds several species, one of which is responsive to PDGF and may be the same PDGF-responsive species bound by element 2. The appearance of the PDGF-responsive species has a time course consistent with the nuclear run-on experiments. Of note, no early binding is seen in response to Ang, but some binding is seen 1 h after Ang treatment. This later appearance may reflect secondary, rather than direct, effects of Ang receptor stimulation and apparently is not sufficient for inducing the JE promoter. Further studies will be necessary to fully characterize the mechanism(s) by which elements 1 and 2 cooperate in regulatingJE promoter activity.It should be stressed that the studies presented above do not establish the precise boundaries of the PDGF-responsive elements. As shown in Fig. 6, mutations in any region of element 2 abolished the activity. This suggests that the entire sequence may be necessary for binding. Preliminary gel shifts (data not shown) with the mutations examined in Fig. 6 showed that disruption of any part of the molecule resulted in a loss of the PDGF-responsive band. Given the complexity of the binding patterns for both elements and the presence of several species that are bound constitutively, it is highly likely that the PDGF effect requires the interaction of several proteins bound to different regions of the elements. The lack of effect of antibodies to c-Jun/AP-1 or Ets-1/Ets-2 on the binding of the PDGF-responsive species raises the possibility that the protein(s) involved may be different from those previously shown to mediate PDGF responses or to regulate the JE orMCP-1 genes.Searches of GenBankTM (release 90.0, 8/95), EMBL (release 43.0, 6/95), and Eukaryotic Promoter (release 43, 6/95) data bases with both putative elements and the entire fragment containing both elements suggest that the sequences conveying PDGF specificity may be novel. Element 1 has high homology (>70% identity) to a 5′-flanking region of Mus musculus cathepsin B (accession number X76621) and to areas in the promoter regions of Aspergillus niger PX18 (accession number M90701), Homo sapiens gastrin (accession number EDP 25015), and M. musculus keratin (accession number EDP 32005). Element 2 has high homology only with sequences in the 5′ region of the murine macrophage inflammatory protein 2 gene. Macrophage inflamatory protein 2 protein is a cytokine with potent chemotactic activity for human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (42Tekamp-Olson P. Gallegos C. Bauer D. McClain J. Sherry B. Fabre M. van Deventer S. Cerami A. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 172: 911-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 43Huang S. Paulauskis J.D. Godleski J.J. Kobzik L. Am. J. Pathol. 1992; 141: 981-988PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, none of the genes identified contain areas of high homology with both elements, and searches of the literature did not provide evidence that these genes were PDGF-responsive. No regions highly homologous to either element exist in the human MCP-1gene, suggesting that they may be species-specific. It should be noted that while PDGF and MCP-1 have been co-localized in human plaques (23Nelken N.A. Coughlin S.R. Gordon D. Wilcox J.N. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 88: 1121-1127Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,26Wilcox J.N. J. Vasc. Surg. 1992; 15: 913-915Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), the regulation of MCP-1 by PDGF in human SMC has not as yet been described.Regulatory elements in the promoter regions of JE/MCP-1genes have been identified by several groups of investigators (34Timmers H.T.M.

(34Timmers H.T.M. Pronk G.J. Bos J.L. van der Eb A.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 23-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) established that the −70/−38 region of the rat JE promoter was necessary for its basal activity in transiently transfected 3T3 cells and established that the region −141/−88 was essential for the response to the phorbol ester TPA. Our study also suggests that the AP-1-like site located within the −70/−38 region is necessary for basal promoter activity in rat aortic SMC. Li and Kolattukudy (44Li Y.-S. Kolattukudy P.E. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 141: 121-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) established that two elements (at positions −156 to −150 and −128 to −123) in the promoter region of human MCP-1 were necessary and sufficient to confer inducibility by TPA onto a CAT reporter construct transiently expressed in human glioblastoma cells. Activation of human MCP-1 by TNFα occurred via different cis-acting elements, because TNFα did not activate the TPA-inducible reporter constructs.Freter et al. (45Freter R.R. Irminger J.-C. Porter J.A. Jones S.D. Stiles C.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5288-5300Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) identified two cis-acting regions that were necessary for the activation of the murineJE gene by serum, PDGF, IL-1, and double-stranded RNA in transiently transfected BALB/c 3T3 fibroblasts. That study did not demonstrate activation of reporter constructs and utilized RNase protection assays with a series of tagged genomic JE probes. The distal 240-bp sequence in the 5′-flanking JE region (positions −2537 to −2298 relative to the start site) had weak transcriptional enhancer activity. The other element identified in the study was a novel 7-mer, TTTTGTA, located in the 3′ region of the murine JE after the stop codon. Its activity was position-dependent and orientation independent. The 7-mer is present in 3′ regions of a number of transcription factors and cytokines belonging to the immediate early gene class, including humanMCP-1. In follow-up studies (46Freter R.R. Alberta J.A. Lam K.K. Stiles C.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 315-325Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 47Freter R.R. Alberta J.A. Hwang G.Y. Wrentmore A.L. Stiles C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17417-17424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), four PDGF-regulated elements were identified within the region located in the 240-bp 5′-flanking murine JE sequences. Two of these elements (I and IV) are similar in sequence and bind several forms of NF-κB. The other two elements (II and III) were previously uncharacterized sequences that bind a PDGF-activated serine-threonine phosphoprotein found in the nucleus of PDGF-treated 3T3 fibroblasts.In the rat JE gene, murine elements I and IV are not present. There is a region in the rat JE promoter (positions −472 to −449) with a 72% homology to murine element II in reverse orientation; however, our data indicate that the presence of this region is not required for activation of JE in SMC by PDGF. The rat JE gene also possesses a region with 69.2% homology to murine element III in reverse orientation; this region is located 15 bp downstream of the initiation codon. Thus, the pathways that lead to transcriptional induction by PDGF of JE in mouse appear to be different from those in rat and may also be different in SMC from other cell types.We have previously reported that changes in mRNA stability were responsible for part of the increase in JE mRNA levels seen after PDGF treatment (19Taubman M.B. Rollins B.J. Poon M. Marmur J. Green R.S. Berk B.C. Nadal-Ginard B. Circ. Res. 1992; 70: 314-325Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In that study, nuclear run-on experiments, performed at 1 and 2 h, did not suggest a major transcriptional component. These time points were originally chosen because of the delayed peak in JE mRNA levels. The current study employed considerably earlier time points (15 and 30 min) to examine JE transcription. Using these time points, PDGF was found to cause a marked but very transient increase in JE transcription. Taken together, these studies suggest that the initial response to PDGF is an elevation in transcription, which is short lived. This is accompanied by an increase in mRNA stability (half-life of 2.5 versus 0.5 h), resulting in a prolonged elevation in JE mRNA levels beyond that seen with other immediate early genes.As noted in the Introduction, the intracellular signaling pathways responsible for JE mRNA accumulation in rat aortic SMC remain to be determined. Initial studies employing RNA blot analyses and a variety of inhibitors failed to demonstrate a role for protein kinase C, mobilization of intracellular calcium, activation of the Na+-H+ exchanger, and changes in cyclic AMP (19Taubman M.B. Rollins B.J. Poon M. Marmur J. Green R.S. Berk B.C. Nadal-Ginard B. Circ. Res. 1992; 70: 314-325Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). While these studies were by no means exhaustive and do not rule out participation of any of these signals, they do suggest that the induction of JE mRNA in rat aortic SMC by PDGF involves signaling pathways distinct from those involved in the induction of a number of other immediate early genes in rat SMC, including c-fos, KC, and tissue factor (30Taubman M.B. Marmur J.D. Rosenfield C.-L. Guha A. Nichtberger S. Nemerson Y. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 547-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 48Taubman M.B. Berk B.C. Izumo S. Tsuda T.

Circulation. 1992; 86: 53-60Google Scholar). The current study, demonstrating potentially novel PDGF-specific elements in the rat JE gene, gives further credence to the concept that the regulation of JE in rat aortic SMC may involve an unusual set of signaling pathways.PDGF and Ang have been implicated in the development of atherosclerosis, in the response of the vessel wall to injury, and in the vascular changes associated with hypertension (1Ross R. Nature. 1993; 362: 801-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (9925) Google Scholar, 2Owens G.K. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 257: H1755-H1765PubMed Google Scholar, 50Dzau V.J. J. Hypertension. 1994; 12: S3-10Google Scholar). While considerable information exists about the signals induced in VSMC by PDGF and Ang, the induction of JE remains one of the few phenomena described that distinguish the early response of adult rat aortic VSMC to these two agonists. JE/MCP-1 protein appears to function chiefly as a monocyte chemoattractant and has not been shown to be a mitogen. It is therefore unlikely that JE/MCP-1 is directly responsible for the difference between PDGF-induced hyperplasia and Ang-induced hypertrophy. Dissection of the rat JE promoter in SMC and identification of the proteins that bind to the PDGF-responsive elements may help elucidate PDGF-specific pathways. This may provide powerful tools for identifying downstream signals that differentiate PDGF- and Ang-induced transcription and may be involved in differentiating the growth responses. Growth and migration of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC)1 are critical events in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, hypertension, and angiogenesis (1Ross R. Nature. 1993; 362: 801-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (9925) Google Scholar). VSMC exhibit two types of growth: hyperplasia, characterized by increased DNA and protein synthesis as well as cell division, and hypertrophy, characterized by increased cell size and protein content without DNA synthesis or cell division (2Owens G.K. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 257: H1755-H1765PubMed Google Scholar). VSMC hyperplasia is an important feature of atherogenesis and involves the migration of VSMC from the vessel media to the intima and the proliferation of medial and intimal VSMC (1Ross R. Nature. 1993; 362: 801-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (9925) Google Scholar). VSMC hypertrophy is more typical of the vascular response to chronic hypertension, although hyperplasia is seen in hypertension as well (2Owens G.K. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 257: H1755-H1765PubMed Google Scholar). The growth responses of cultured VSMC appear to be agonist-specific. In adult rat aortic VSMC, platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and serum induce hyperplasia (3Ross R. Raines E.W. Bowen-Pope D.F. Cell. 1986; 46: 155-169Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1573) Google Scholar). In the same cells, angiotensin II (Ang) and α-thrombin induce hypertrophy (3Ross R. Raines E.W. Bowen-Pope D.F.

Ang and PDGF activate many of the same intracellular signals, including the activation of phospholipase C, the induction of the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade, and the activation of the Na+-H+antiporter, and induce similar sets of early response genes (reviewed in Refs. 3Ross R.

https://openalex.org/W1636907202,"Cementum-derived growth factor (CGF) is a 14 kDa polypeptide sequestered in tooth cementum. It is an IGF-I like molecule that is weakly mitogenic to fibroblasts, but its mitogenic action is synergistically potentiated in the presence of epidermal growth factor (EGF) or serum. We have examined whether the CGF affects cyclin E levels and the activity of cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) associated with this cyclin, and whether these changes contribute to the synergism in mitogenic activity between CGF and EGF. Optimal DNA synthesis by serum-starved human gingival fibroblasts required the presence of CGF for 0-12 h and EGF for 0-3 h. Therefore, cells were serum starved for 48 h and then exposed to CGF, EGF, or CGF + EGF. Cells incubated with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) served as positive controls. At various time points after the addition of growth factors, cyclin E levels were examined by Western analysis. Cdk associated with cyclin E was immunoprecipitated with anti-cyclin E antibody and kinase activity was measured using H1 histone as substrate. Cyclin E and the H1 kinase activity levels increased after 8-12 h in cells exposed to CGF and in positive controls exposed to 10% FBS. They returned to basal level 4 h later in cells exposed to CGF alone, whereas in the presence of CGF + EGF and FBS they remained elevated for up to 20 h. The cyclin E levels did not increase in the presence of EGF alone. Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p21cip1 and p27kip1 were barely detectable in these cells. Fibroblasts transfected with LXSN-cyclin E, a retroviral vector containing cyclin E cDNA, overexpressed cyclin E and their steady-state cyclin E-Cdk activity was higher than control cells. DNA synthesis by cyclin E overexpressing cells was higher, but optimal DNA synthesis by these cells required the presence of CGF and EGF. These results show that CGF action involves an increase in the levels of cyclin E and E-Cdk activity and that the higher levels are maintained in the presence of both CGF and EGF. They also indicate that sustained high cyclin E levels and Cdk2 activity during G1 phase are necessary, but not sufficient, for optimal mitogenic response in human fibroblasts."
https://openalex.org/W2002092831,"F inding new tools for the diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of cancers is a major goal of cancer research. Tumor markers are particularly useful for both cancer diagnostics and prognosis. New tumor markers based on genetic polymorphisms are routinely identified. The analysis of these markers requires a variety of technologies, from immunofluorescence, to in situ hybridization, to the polymerase chain reaction.

Unfortunately, to date, tumor markers have not gained widespread use in day-to-day clinical practices, although they are used in certain clinical trials to guide therapy. One of the main reasons for this is the paucity of solid population data to show the predictive value of any one marker. Additionally, it is difficult to look at an array of tumor markers simultaneously in single specimens. A multitest survey of tumors is needed to show the predictive relationships among different markers.

A recent report in Nature Medicine may well change the medical landscape and speed implementation of such markers in clinical practice. The authors describe a new technique that allows researchers to study up to 1000 tumor biopsies at a time ([1][1]). The authors built an instrument, which consists of a thin-walled, stainless steel tube, with an inner diameter of 600 μm, sharpened like a cork borer. They used this needle to select punch biopsies 3 to 4 mm in height from fixed tumor samples. Using a solid stainless steel wire, which functions as a stylet, the sample is then emptied into a recipient array block with drilled holes. A digital micrometer moves the system to successive locations in the growing array. The recipient paraffin block (45 mm by 20 mm) can have 200 consecutive 8-μm sections [see figure 1 of ([1][1])]. Each of the 200 sections holds up to 1000 tumor samples. The power of this tissue microarray technique is the capability of performing a series of analyses of 1000 specimens in a parallel fashion. Armed with such a research tool, researchers can study vast numbers of tumor samples in a short time and can generate a wealth of data on the application of tumor markers.

As proof of principle, the authors performed immunohistochemical analyses (for protein expression), fluorescence in situ hybridization (for DNA amplification), and RNA/RNA in situ hybridization (for messenger RNA expression). They used 645 breast tumors to create the microarray. They then studied sections of this array with eight markers: estrogen receptor expression, p53 expression, and DNA amplification at the CCND1, ERBB2, MYC, 17q23, 20q13, and MYBL2 loci. Their results match published data, validating their approach. Specifically, at least one of the six DNA loci was amplified in 52% of primary tumors: ERBB2, 18%; MYC, 25%; CCND1, 24%; 17q23, 13%; 20q13, 6%; and MYBL2, 7%. They also reproduced previous findings showing that ERBB2 and MYC were amplified more often in tumors lacking estrogen receptors, whereas the opposite was observed for CCND1.

Finally, p53-positive tumors had a higher frequency of MYC and ERBB2 amplification than p53-negative ones. The technique appears simple, and the authors can process 1000 samples in 3 days time. The major drawback of the approach is the small diameter (0.6 mm) of the punch biopsy. With such a small core, areas of interest are easily missed in tumors that show a significant amount of heterogeneity. Multiple samples from each tumor specimen can reduce this problem. The authors note that increasing the density of the array so that more than 1000 specimens can be housed in the recipient block would extend the throughput of the system. Other technical tricks could be implemented; for instance, researchers could combine immunohistochemical methods with fluorescence in situ hybridization to use multiple detection probes simultaneously.

Variations and improvements on this technique can be expected in the near future. This research tool should have wide application in the field of cancer research, as well as in other fields (such as developmental biology) where molecular markers are especially informative.

https://openalex.org/W19093925,"Whenever the process of exchanging reagents among scientists becomes easier, science benefits. Take as an example the community of scientists who experiment with the simple organism, yeast. The simple property that yeast strains can be dried on filter paper disks has aided the distribution of a wide variety of mutants. Dried yeast strains can be maintained indefinitely at room temperature. They can be transported in an envelope for just 32 cents. Imagine, though, if yeast strains needed to be cryopreserved in liquid nitrogen to maintain their viability. The cost alone of exchanging the thousands of mutant yeast strains would be enormous."
