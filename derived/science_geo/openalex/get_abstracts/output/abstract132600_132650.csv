It can grow on hydrogen, oxygen, carbon dioxide, and mineral salts. The complex metabolic machinery needed for A. aeolicus to function as a chemolithoautotroph (an organism which uses an inorganic carbon source for biosynthesis and an inorganic chemical energy source) is encoded within a genome that is only one-third the size of the E. coli genome. Metabolic flexibility seems to be reduced as a result of the limited genome size. The use of oxygen (albeit at very low concentrations) as an electron acceptor is allowed by the presence of a complex respiratory apparatus. Although this organism grows at 95 degrees C, the extreme thermal limit of the Bacteria, only a few specific indications of thermophily are apparent from the genome. Here we describe the complete genome sequence of 1,551,335 base pairs of this evolutionarily and physiologically interesting organism."

There is increasing evidence that generation of truncated proteins containing an expanded polyglutamine tract may be a key step in the pathogenesis of these disorders. We now report that, similar to huntingtin, atrophin-1, ataxin-3, and the androgen receptor are cleaved in apoptotic extracts. Furthermore, each of these proteins is cleaved by one or more purified caspases, cysteine proteases involved in apoptotic death. The CAG length does not modulate susceptibility to cleavage of any of the full-length proteins. Our results suggest that by generation of truncated polyglutamine-containing proteins, caspase cleavage may represent a common step in the pathogenesis of each of these neurodegenerative diseases.

Eight neurodegenerative disorders are caused by expansion of a CAG trinucleotide repeat encoding polyglutamine. This group of diseases includes Huntington's disease (HD), 1The abbreviations used are: HD, Huntington's disease; DRPLA, dentatorubropallidoluysian atrophy; SCA-3, spinocerebellar ataxia type 3/Machado-Joseph disease; ICE, interleukin-converting enzyme; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; MEKK, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase; TBP, TATA-binding protein. 1The abbreviations used are: HD, Huntington's disease; DRPLA, dentatorubropallidoluysian atrophy; SCA-3, spinocerebellar ataxia type 3/Machado-Joseph disease; ICE, interleukin-converting enzyme; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; MEKK, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase; TBP, TATA-binding protein.dentatorubropallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA), spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA-3), spinal bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA), and spinocerebellar ataxia types 1, 2, 6, and 7 (1Wellington C.L.

Remarkably, polyglutamine expansion results in disorders with numerous similarities, although the causative proteins of these diseases do not share structural homology outside of the CAG tract. For example, disease occurs only when the CAG length expands over a certain threshold (6David G. Abbas N. Stevanin G. Durr A. Yvert G. Cancel G. Weber C. Imbert G. Saudou F. Antoniou E. Drabkin H.

Also, each disorder has a distinct and selective pattern of neurodegeneration although the causative proteins are widely expressed (3Robitaille Y. Lopes-Cendes I. Becher M. Rouleau G.A. Clark A.W. Brain Pathol. 1997; 7: 901-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 6David G. Abbas N. Stevanin G. Durr A. Yvert G. Cancel G. Weber C. Imbert G. Saudou F. Antoniou E. Drabkin H. Gemmill R.

Neuron. 1995; 15: 493-496Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Because neurodegenerative illness results from a similar mutation in all of these diseases, they may share a similar pathogenesis resulting from polyglutamine expansion. We have previously hypothesized that neuronal toxicity may be a consequence of polyglutamine expansion per se, with the regional selectivity of degeneration conferred by amino acid sequences surrounding the polyglutamine tract (1Wellington C.L. Brinkman R.R. O'Kusky J.R. Hayden M.R. Brain Pathol. 1997; 7: 979-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 10Wellington C.L. Hayden M.R. Curr. Opin. Neurol. 1997; 10: 291-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). An apoptotic mode of cell death appears to be operative in HD, since brains of HD patients show increased levels of DNA strand breaks typical of apoptotic cells (11Dragunow M. Faull R.L. Lawlor P. Beihartz E.J. Singleton K. Walker E.B. Mee E. Neuroreport. 1995; 6: 1053-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Also, cells transfected with amino-terminal huntingtin constructs have an increased susceptibility to apoptosis (12Martindale D. Hackam A. Wieczorek A. Ellerby L. Wellington C. McCutcheon K. Singaraja R. Kazemi-Esfarjani P. Devon R. Kim S.U. Bredesen D. Tufaro F. Hayden M.R. Nat. Genet. 1998; (in press)Google Scholar). There is increasing evidence that truncation of polyglutamine-containing proteins may play an important role in the initiation or propagation of cellular toxicity in the triplet expansion diseases (12Martindale D. Hackam A. Wieczorek A. Ellerby L. Wellington C. McCutcheon K. Singaraja R. Kazemi-Esfarjani P. Devon R. Kim S.U. Bredesen D. Tufaro F. Hayden M.R. Nat. Genet. 1998; (in press)Google Scholar). Biochemical and immunohistochemical studies show amino-terminal huntingtin fragments in brain tissue from affected HD patients and not from controls (13DiFiglia M. Sapp E. Chase K.O. Davies S.W. Bates G.P. Vonsattel J.P. Aronin N. Science. 1997; 277: 1990-1993Crossref PubMed Scopus (2313) Google Scholar). Brains from HD patients also contain neurons with intracellular aggregates of huntingtin that may develop from amino-terminal huntingtin fragments (13DiFiglia M. Sapp E. Chase K.O. Davies S.W. Bates G.P. Vonsattel J.P. Aronin N. Science. 1997; 277: 1990-1993Crossref PubMed Scopus (2313) Google Scholar). Furthermore, transgenic animals expressing only exon 1 of the HD gene with long polyglutamine tracts develop a progressive neurological phenotype associated with intraneuronal intranuclear inclusions (14Mangiarini L. Sathasivam K. Seller M. Cozens B. Harper A. Hetherington C. Lawton M. Trottier Y. Lehrach H. Davies S.W. Bates G.P.

Mangiarini L. Bates G.P. Cell. 1997; 90: 537-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1909) Google Scholar).In vitro, cells transfected with amino-terminal huntingtin constructs contain aggregates that are increased in frequency and size when huntingtin is truncated and the polyglutamine tract is expanded (12Martindale D. Hackam A. Wieczorek A. Ellerby L. Wellington C. McCutcheon K. Singaraja R. Kazemi-Esfarjani P. Devon R. Kim S.U. Bredesen D. Tufaro F. Hayden M.R. Nat. Genet. 1998; (in press)Google Scholar). Intracellular aggregates are also observed in brains of SCA-3 patients and in an in vitro model of this disease (16Paulson H.L. Perez M.K. Trottier Y. Trojanowski J.Q. Subramony S.H. Das S.S. Vig P. Mandel J.-L. Fischbeck K.H. Pittman R.N. Neuron. 1997; 19: 333-344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar). However,in vitro studies have shown that aggregates do not form unless cells are transfected with truncated ataxin-3 constructs (16Paulson H.L. Perez M.K. Trottier Y. Trojanowski J.Q. Subramony S.H. Das S.S. Vig P. Mandel J.-L. Fischbeck K.H. Pittman R.N. Neuron. 1997; 19: 333-344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar). Similarly, truncation of atrophin-1 increases the frequency of aggregate formation in an in vitro model of DRPLA (17Igarashi S. Koide R. Shimohata T. Yamada M. Hayashi Y. Takana H. Date H. Oyake M. Sato A. Egawa S. Ikeuchi T. Tanaka H. Nakano R. Tanaka K. Hozumi I. Inozuka T. Takahashi H. Tsuji S. Nat. Genet. 1998; 18: 111-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). The emerging principle from these studies is that one step in the pathogenic mechanism shared among these disorders is that truncation of the parent protein leads to the formation of intracellular aggregates that correlate with an increased susceptibility to apoptotic cell death. It is important, therefore, to understand how proteins containing polyglutamine tracts may be proteolytically cleaved. Identification of key proteases involved in the truncation of polyglutamine-containing proteins could be important for the development of therapeutic agents that may be useful for each of the polyglutamine expansion disorders. Thus far, it is known that huntingtin is a substrate for proteolytic cleavage by caspase-3 (18Goldberg Y.P. Nicholson D.W. Rasper D.M. Kalchman M.A. Koide H.B. Graham R.K. Bromm M. Kazemi-Esfarjani P. Thornberry N.A. Vaillancourt J.P. Hayden M.R. Nat. Genet. 1996; 13: 442-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar), one member of a large family of cysteine proteases that becomes activated as the cell initiates programmed cell death (19Martin S.J. Green D.R. Cell. 1995; 82: 349-352Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1260) Google Scholar, 20Ellis H.M. Horvitz H.R. Cell. 1986; 44: 817-829Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1353) Google Scholar). To date, 10 mammalian caspases have been identified, and they are classified into three major subfamilies known as ICE-like, activator, or effector caspases based on their sequence homology, function, and substrate specificity (21Thornberry N.A. Rano T.A. Peterson E.P. Rasper D.M. Timkey T. Garcia-Calvo M. Houtzager V.M. Nordstrom P.A. Ray S. Vaillancourt J.P. Chapman K.T. Nicholson D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17907-17911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1844) Google Scholar). However, this classification may not be absolute, since at least one caspase (caspase-6) has features of both activator and effector caspases (21Thornberry N.A. Rano T.A. Peterson E.P. Rasper D.M. Timkey T. Garcia-Calvo M. Houtzager V.M. Nordstrom P.A. Ray S. Vaillancourt J.P. Chapman K.T. Nicholson D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17907-17911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1844) Google Scholar). Because we have previously reported cleavage of huntingtin by caspase-3 (18Goldberg Y.P. Nicholson D.W. Rasper D.M. Kalchman M.A. Koide H.B. Graham R.K. Bromm M. Kazemi-Esfarjani P. Thornberry N.A. Vaillancourt J.P. Hayden M.R. Nat. Genet. 1996; 13: 442-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar), we wished to answer two questions relevant to extending this model to other polyglutamine expansion disorders. First, is huntingtin cleaved by other caspases, and if so, how does this cleavage compare with cleavage by caspase-3? Second, can caspases cleave other polyglutamine-containing proteins associated with neurodegeneration? We report here that, similar to huntingtin, the androgen receptor, atrophin-1, and ataxin-3 are also specifically cleaved by one or more caspases in vitro. In each case, a truncated protein fragment containing the polyglutamine tract is liberated by caspase cleavage. Caspase cleavage of these polyglutamine-containing proteins may thus represent a shared step in the pathogenesis of the CAG expansion disorders. The construction of the full-length human huntingtin expression construct has been previously described (22Goldberg Y.P. Kalchman M.A. Metzler M. Nasir J. Zeisler J. Graham R. Koide H.B. O'Kusky J. Sharp A.H. Ross C.A. Jirik F. Hayden M.R. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1996; 5: 177-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The N-terminal huntingtin constructs, pCI1955–15 and pCI1955–128, were derived from pCMV1955–15 and pCMV1955–128, respectively (18Goldberg Y.P. Nicholson D.W. Rasper D.M. Kalchman M.A. Koide H.B. Graham R.K. Bromm M. Kazemi-Esfarjani P. Thornberry N.A. Vaillancourt J.P. Hayden M.R. Nat. Genet. 1996; 13: 442-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis was used to introduce a translational termination codon immediately after nucleotide position 1955 (amino acid 548) in huntingtin using the mutagenic primers 5′-GACCCTGCCATGTGAGATCCTCTAGAG-3′ for construction of 1955-15 and 5′-GACCCTGCCATGTGAGGTACCGAGCTC-3′ for 1955-128. Mutagenesis was performed as recommended for the Transformer site-directed mutagenesis kit (CLONTECH). Following mutagenesis, huntingtin fragments were subcloned into the pCI-neo vector (Promega) for all subsequent experiments. A C-terminal huntingtin expression construct encoding amino acids 585–3144 was prepared by excising a 8292-base pairKpnI–NotI fragment from pCMV10366 and inserting this fragment into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) that had been digested withKpnI and NotI. A linker containing the Kozak consensus sequence and an ATG start codon was inserted into theKpnI site of the resulting plasmid. Restoration of the correct translational reading frame was confirmed by sequence analysis. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to identify a caspase-3 cleavage site within the first 548 amino acids of huntingtin. Huntingtin D513A was made using the mutagenic primer 5′-GACTCAGTGGCTCTGGCCAGC-3′. Mutant D530A was made using the mutagenic primer 5′-GATGAGGAGGCTATCTTGAG-3′. Both primers were used simultaneously to generate the double mutant, D513A,D530A. Clones 1 (in pCRII) and 6 (in pBluescript) as reported (23Margolis R.L. Li S.H. Young W.S. Wagster M.V. Stine O.C. Kidwai A.S. Ashworth R.G. Ross C.A. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1996; 36: 219-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) were each digested with AccI and KpnI. The 6-kilobase pair fragment of clone 6 was ligated to the 1.5-kilobase pair fragment of clone 1, resulting in a construct (Atcon3) containing the complete atrophin-1 open reading frame with 22 consecutive CAG repeats. First strand cDNA from the liver of a patient with DRPLA (61 consecutive CAG repeats) was amplified across the repeat, with the final product including an AccI site at base pair 1350 (numbered according to GenBankTM accession number U23851) 5′ to the repeat and a NarI site at base pair 1844 3′ to the repeat. This product was ligated into pCRII (Invitrogen) and digested with AccI and NarI. Atcon3 was similarly digested, and the 495-base pairAccI-NarI fragment containing the expanded repeat was ligated into Atcon3, creating At-61, a clone with a full-length atrophin-1 cDNA containing 61 consecutive CAG repeats. This was subsequently ligated into the vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) after digestion with KpnI and XbaI. The ataxin-3 constructs with 35 or 79 glutamines have been previously described (24Ikeda H. Yamaguchi M. Sugai S. Aze Y. Narumiya S. Kakizuka A. Nat. Genet. 1996; 13: 196-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). These constructs contain a hemagglutinin tag on the N-terminal end to facilitate detection of the protein in cells. The construction of the expression plasmids encoding androgen receptors with 12 or 50 glutamines in their polyglutamine tract has been fully described (25Kazemi-Esfarjani P. Trifiro M.A. Pinsky L. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1995; 4: 523-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). Extracts from D8 osteosarcoma cells were prepared as described previously (25Kazemi-Esfarjani P. Trifiro M.A. Pinsky L. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1995; 4: 523-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). Jurkat cells were induced to undergo apoptosis by treatment with 10 μg/ml camptothecin for 4 h at 37 °C. Cells were centrifuged at 1000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, washed once with cold phosphate-buffered saline, and resuspended in 108cells/ml of lysis buffer (10 mm Hepes/KOH, pH 7.0, 10% (w/v) sucrose, 2 mm EDTA, 0.1% CHAPS, 5 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin). After incubation on ice for 15 min, the lysates were centrifuged at 1000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were further centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The resulting supernatant was aliquoted and stored at −80 °C. Coupled in vitro transcription/translation was performed using the Promega TNT reticulocyte or wheat germ systems as recommended by the manufacturer, using between 0.5 and 1 μg of Qiagen or cesium chloride-prepared cDNA and including [35S]methionine in the reaction mixture for incorporation into the synthesized polypeptide. Radioactively labeled polypeptides were resolved by fractionation on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and detected as described previously (18Goldberg Y.P. Nicholson D.W. Rasper D.M. Kalchman M.A. Koide H.B. Graham R.K. Bromm M. Kazemi-Esfarjani P. Thornberry N.A. Vaillancourt J.P. Hayden M.R. Nat. Genet. 1996; 13: 442-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). The SDS-PAGE conditions were as follows: 7.5 or 5% polyacrylamide for 35S-huntingtin and35S-atrophin-1, 7.5 or 12% for 35S-androgen receptor, 12% for 35S-ataxin-3, and 10% for35S-poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase and 35S-labeled TATA-binding protein (35S-TBP). The reaction product from each translation was included in each assay after incubation in cleavage buffer only, as a negative control (Uncleaved lanes in Figs. Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5). Equal amounts of apoptotic or nonapoptotic extracts (50 μg of protein) were preincubated with cleavage buffer (50 mm Hepes/KOH (pH 7.0), 10% sucrose, 0.2 mmEDTA, 0.1% (w/v) CHAPS, 5 mm dithiothreitol; 24.5-μl reaction volume) or with cleavage buffer containing 10 nmAc-DEVD-CHO or 10 nm Ac-YVAD-CHO for 30 min at 37 °C. Cleavage reactions (n = 3) were initiated by the addition of radiolabeled substrate protein (0.5–1.0 μl) to the extract, and incubation was continued for an additional 3 h at 37 °C. Proteolytic fragments were resolved by SDS-PAGE and detected as described (18Goldberg Y.P. Nicholson D.W. Rasper D.M. Kalchman M.A. Koide H.B. Graham R.K. Bromm M. Kazemi-Esfarjani P. Thornberry N.A. Vaillancourt J.P. Hayden M.R. Nat. Genet. 1996; 13: 442-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). In vitro cleavage assays were performed essentially as described (18Goldberg Y.P.

Radiolabeled substrate protein (0.5–1.0 μl) was incubated at 37 °C in cleavage buffer along with purified caspase at different concentrations and times. Recombinant caspases were generated as described previously (21Thornberry N.A. Rano T.A. Peterson E.P. Rasper D.M. Timkey T. Garcia-Calvo M. Houtzager V.M. Nordstrom P.A. Ray S. Vaillancourt J.P.

Measurements (n = 3) ofkcat/Km values for caspase cleavage of substrates were performed exactly as described previously (18Goldberg Y.P. Nicholson D.W. Rasper D.M. Kalchman M.A. Koide H.B.

Proteolytic cleavage was quantified by laser densitometry. Caspases cleave proteins following an essential aspartate residue (30Porter A.G. Ng P. Janicke R.U. BioEssays. 1997; 19: 501-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Combinatorial and synthetic approaches have been used to define the optimal tetrapeptide consensus cleavage sites for each of the known caspase families as (I/V/L)EXD for the activator caspases, DEXD for the effector caspases, and (W/L)EHD for the ICE-like caspases, whereX is any amino acid (21Thornberry N.A. Rano T.A. Peterson E.P. Rasper D.M. Timkey T. Garcia-Calvo M. Houtzager V.M. Nordstrom P.A. Ray S. Vaillancourt J.P. Chapman K.T. Nicholson D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17907-17911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1844) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, human huntingtin, atrophin-1, androgen receptor, and ataxin-3 all contain potential sites for caspase cleavage. Interestingly, the predicted caspase cleavage sites in these proteins sometimes occur in clusters. To determine whether human huntingtin, atrophin-1, ataxin-3, and the androgen receptor were cleaved in extracts, in vitrotranslated proteins were incubated with cytoplasmic extracts prepared from proliferating (nonapoptotic) or postconfluent (apoptotic) D8 osteosarcoma cells. Extracts prepared from postconfluent D8 osteosarcoma cells are known to express high levels of caspase-3 (26Nicholson D.W. Ali A. Thornberry N.A. Vaillancourt J.P. Ding C.K. Gallant M. Gareau Y. Griffin P.R. Labelle M. Lazebnik Y.A. Munday N.A. Raju S.M. Smulson M.E. Yamin T.-T. Yu V.L. Miller D.K. Nature. 1995; 376: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (3789) Google Scholar) and have been used in previous studies on huntingtin cleavage (18Goldberg Y.P. Nicholson D.W. Rasper D.M. Kalchman M.A. Koide H.B. Graham R.K. Bromm M. Kazemi-Esfarjani P. Thornberry N.A. Vaillancourt J.P. Hayden M.R. Nat. Genet. 1996; 13: 442-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). The reversible competitive tetrapeptide aldehyde inhibitors Ac-DEVD-CHO and Ac-YVAD-CHO inhibit the effector and ICE-like caspases, respectively (25Kazemi-Esfarjani P. Trifiro M.A. Pinsky L. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1995; 4: 523-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). After first confirming that inhibition of purified caspase-3 or caspase-1 could be achieved under the experimental conditions used, these tetrapeptide inhibitors were used to determine the class of caspases responsible for specific cleavage events in extracts. In vitro translation of huntingtin truncated at amino acid 548 produced proteins of 80 and 110 kDa for proteins containing 15 and 128 glutamines, respectively (Fig. 2 A). Truncated huntingtin is cleaved in apoptotic D8 extracts, yielding a 67-kDa fragment for a construct with 15 glutamines and a 98-kDa fragment for a construct with 128 glutamines (Fig. 2 A). These sizes are consistent with our previous observation that the caspase-3 cleavage product of this construct with 44 glutamines migrates at 80 kDa (18Goldberg Y.P. Nicholson D.W. Rasper D.M. Kalchman M.A. Koide H.B. Graham R.K. Bromm M. Kazemi-Esfarjani P. Thornberry N.A. Vaillancourt J.P. Hayden M.R. Nat. Genet. 1996; 13: 442-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). Cleavage of both constructs was inhibited by preincubation of the extract with Ac-DEVD-CHO but not Ac-YVAD-CHO, indicating that these cleavage products probably result from the activity of an effector caspase (Fig. 2 A). In vitro translation of atrophin-1 generated proteins of 180 and 210 kDa for constructs with 22 and 61 glutamines, respectively (Fig. 2 B). The smaller molecular weight band visible in theUncleaved lanes is likely due to internal initiation or premature termination products generated during in vitroprotein synthesis. A specific predominant product of 130 or 135 kDa was generated when atrophin-1 with 22 or 61 glutamines, respectively, was incubated with apoptotic D8 osteosarcoma extract (Fig. 2 B). These cleavage products were nearly completely inhibited by Ac-DEVD-CHO but not by Ac-YVAD-CHO, demonstrating that they too are likely to result from the activity of an effector caspase. Small amounts of cleavage product were observed after incubation in the nonapoptotic extract, which may be due to self-activation of caspases during extract preparation or to additional proteases active against atrophin-1. In vitro translation of ataxin-3 produced a predominant 36- or 40-kDa protein containing 35 or 79 glutamines, respectively (Fig. 2 C). The several smaller molecular weight bands visible in the Uncleaved lanes most likely represent internal initiation or premature termination products produced during in vitro protein synthesis. The specific cleavage products that appear after incubation with the apoptotic extract and that were absent in the uncleaved preparation are indicated with arrows (Fig. 2 C). Cleavage of ataxin-3 is inefficient in D8 extracts, resulting in small amounts of fragments migrating at 14 and 18 kDa for constructs with 35 and 79 glutamines, respectively. Interestingly, neither Ac-DEVD-CHO nor Ac-YVAD-CHO inhibited formation of these products (Fig. 2 C), suggesting that proteases other than effector or ICE-like caspases may generate these products in D8 osteosarcoma extracts. In vitro translation of the androgen receptor produced a 95- or 100-kDa protein containing 12 and 50 glutamines, respectively. The androgen receptor was resistant to cleavage in apoptotic and control osteosarcoma extracts (Fig. 2 D). However, the androgen receptor is cleaved in apoptotic Jurkat extracts, yielding a major fragment of 87 kDa (Fig. 2 E) for both normal and expanded alleles, as well as several smaller fragments that are not clearly resolved. The 87-kDa fragment does not contain the polyglutamine tract (Fig. 1 D) and is expected to migrate at a constant size for both normal and expanded alleles. As a control for a polyglutamine-containing protein, we also tested the ability of TBP to be cleaved in apoptotic extracts, since TBP contains a tract of 38 glutamines (31Peterson M.G. Tanese N. Pugh B.F. Tjian R. Science. 1990; 248: 1625-1630Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). TBP remained intact in both control and apoptotic D8 extracts (Fig. 2 F). The results from cleavage and inhibition assays in cell extracts are summarized in Table I. Of the substrates tested, atrophin-1 is cleaved most efficiently in D8 extracts, followed by huntingtin and ataxin-3. The androgen receptor was not cleaved by extracts prepared from D8 osteosarcoma cells but was cleaved efficiently in Jurkat apoptotic extracts.Table ICleavage in apoptotic extractsHuntingtinAtrophin-1Ataxin-3Androgen receptorTBP (38 CAG)Normal (15 CAG)Expanded (128 CAG)Normal (22 CAG)Expanded (61 CAG)Normal (35 CAG)Expanded (79 CAG)Normal (12 CAG)Expanded (50 CAG)Poly-Q fragment size: D867 kDa98 kDa130 kDa135 kDa14 kDa18 kDaNoneNoneNoneInhibited by Ac-DEVD-CHOYesYesYesYesNoNoNDNDInhibited by Ac-YVAD-CHONoNoNoNoNoNoNDNDPoly-Q fragment size: JurkatNDNDNDNDNDND18 kDa1-bPresumed size based on non-polyglutamine-containing fragment of 87 kDa.35 kDa1-bPresumed size based on non-polyglutamine-containing fragment of 87 kDa.1-a ND, not done.1-b Presumed size based on non-polyglutamine-containing fragment of 87 kDa.

In an effort to assess which caspases were active in these apoptotic extracts and were cleaving these gene products, we next compared the ability of individual purified caspases to cleave huntingtin, atrophin-1, ataxin-3, and the androgen receptor in vitro. We used caspase-3 and caspase-7 as representatives of the effector group of caspases, caspase-8 as representative of an activator caspase, and caspase-1 as a representative of an ICE-like caspase (21Thornberry N.A.

All enzymes used in these experiments were normalized to identical molar concentrations to facilitate meaningful comparisons between their cleavage efficiencies.

Our previous studies suggested that the connexin-43 gap junction protein may be a target of activated MAP kinase and that MAP kinase may regulate connexin-43 function. We identified the sites of MAP kinase phosphorylation in in vitro studies as the consensus MAP kinase recognition sites in the cytoplasmic carboxyl tail of connexin-43, Ser255, Ser279, and Ser282. In this study, we demonstrate that activation of MAP kinase by ligand-induced activation of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) or lysophosphatidic acid receptors or by pervanadate-induced inhibition of tyrosine phosphatases results in increased phosphorylation on connexin-43. EGF and lysophosphatidic acid-induced phosphorylation on connexin-43 and the down-regulation of gap junctional communication in EGF-treated cells were blocked by a specific mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase inhibitor (PD98059) that prevented activation of MAP kinase. These studies confirm that connexin-43 is a MAP kinase substrate in vivo and that phosphorylation on Ser255, Ser279, and/or Ser282 initiates the down-regulation of gap junctional communication. Studies with connexin-43 mutants suggest that MAP kinase phosphorylation at one or more of the tandem Ser279/Ser282 sites is sufficient to disrupt gap junctional intercellular communication.

The connexin proteins have intracellular amino and carboxyl termini and four membrane spanning regions that form two extracellular loops and one intracellular loop (2Kumar N.M. Gilula N.B.

Landes Company, Austin, TX1994: 173-194Google Scholar). There is considerable homology among the connexins with the greatest divergences in the intracellular loops and the carboxyl-terminal tails. Connexins are assembled into hexamers or connexons in the trans Golgi network prior to insertion into the plasma membrane (4Musil L.S. Citi S. Molecular Mechanisms of Epithelial Cell Junctions: From Development to Disease. R. G. Landes Company, Austin, TX1994: 173-194Google Scholar). Connexons in one cell dock with connexons in adjacent cells through non-covalent interactions that involve the extracellular loops (5Ghoshroy S. Goodenough D.A. Sosinsky G.E. J. Membr.

An aqueous pore or channel (gap junction) forms and allows for the passive intercellular exchange of small molecular mass molecules, ions, and second messengers (<1000 Da). The different connexin proteins form channels with unique functional properties including differences in the size and charge of the molecules and ions that can traverse the channel (2Kumar N.M.

Cell-to-cell communication mediated through gap junctions is known to be essential to the synchronization of events such as contractions in the myocardium and uterus (18Page E. Manjunath C.K.

Down-regulation of gap junctional communication (GJC) has been noted in many tumor cells (20Yamasaki H. Carcinogenesis. 1990; 11: 1051-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, 23Mesnil M.

Conversely, the up-regulation of GJC in cells deficient in communication has been associated with a decrease in cellular growth rates (25Mehta P.P. Holtz-Wagenblatt A. Rose B. Shalloway D.

Tsukamoto T. Sager R. Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 861-870PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, a study by Martyn et al. (29Martyn K.D. Kurata W.E. Warn-Cramer B.J. Burt J.M. TenBroek E. Lau A.F. Cell Growth Differ. 1997; 8: 1015-1027PubMed Google Scholar) has reported that communication-deficient fibroblast cell lines isolated from Cx43 knock-out (K/O) mouse embryos display a subset of the properties of transformed cells, including increased growth rates. These data further advance the hypothesis that the loss of GJC is associated with the progression toward neoplastic transformation. Some posttranslational phosphorylation on serine is required for the proper assembly of Cx43 gap junctions (4Musil L.S. Citi S. Molecular Mechanisms of Epithelial Cell Junctions: From Development to Disease. R. G. Landes Company, Austin, TX1994: 173-194Google Scholar). However, the sites of phosphorylation and the kinases involved have not as yet been identified. Additional posttranslational phosphorylation on serine and/or on tyrosine has been associated with a decrease in GJC. Down-regulation of GJC in epidermal growth factor (EGF)-treated cells and cells transformed with v-ras has been associated with increased serine phosphorylation on Cx43 (30Lau A.F. Kanemitsu M.Y.

Chang C.C. Warren S.T. Mol. Carcinogen. 1989; 2: 131-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), whereas tyrosine phosphorylation on Cx43 has been associated with decreased GJC in cells transformed with the v-src or v-fps oncogene (34Crow D.S.

EGF induces disruption of GJC and increased serine phosphorylation on Cx43 in a rapid and transient manner that is not mediated by the activation of 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate-sensitive isoforms of protein kinase C (30Lau A.F.

FASEB J. 1995; 9: 726-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (3209) Google Scholar), has been demonstrated to phosphorylate a recombinant Cx43 preparation in vitro on phosphotryptic peptides that co-migrated with phosphotryptic peptides obtained from EGF-treated cells, implicating a potential role for MAP kinase in Cx43 phosphorylation and the regulation of GJC (31Kanemitsu M.Y. Lau A.F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 837-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). We characterized MAP kinase-mediated phosphorylation on Cx43 utilizing a glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein that contained the carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic tail (CT) of Cx43 (aa Val236-Ile382). Site-directed mutagenesis, phosphotryptic peptide analysis, and peptide sequencing were used to identify the specific sites of serine phosphorylation on Cx43 (41Warn-Cramer B.J. Lampe P.D.

MAP kinase phosphorylated Cx43 in vitro on two tryptic peptides that contained the three MAP kinase consensus recognition sequences (tryptic peptide Ser244-Lys258, phosphorylated at Ser255, and tryptic peptide Tyr265-Lys287, phosphorylated at Ser279 and at Ser282). When we deleted the three consensus MAP kinase phosphorylation sites by altering the serine residues to alanine, MAP kinase still phosphorylated Cx43 in vitro on the Tyr265-Lys287 peptide at Ser272 and at Ser273. Ser273 fits the minimal recognition sequence for MAP kinase (serine residue followed by a carboxyl-terminal proline (42Clark-Lewis I. Sanghera J.S. Pelech S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15180-15184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). Phosphorylation at these alternate serine sites occurred only in the absence of the consensus MAP kinase phosphorylation sites. Taken together, our studies have supported the hypothesis that EGF-induced activation of the Ras/Raf/MEK (MAP kinase kinase)/MAP kinase signal transduction pathway leads to MAP kinase-mediated phosphorylation on Cx43 at Ser255, Ser279, and Ser282 (Fig. 7). The data suggest that phosphorylation occurring at one or more of these MAP kinase phosphorylation sites may be sufficient to disrupt GJC. Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) has also been reported to down-regulate GJC and to increase serine phosphorylation on Cx43 (43Hii C.S.T. Oh S.-Y. Schmidt S.A. Clark K.J. Murray A.W. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 475-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). LPA binds to an ∼39-kDa membrane receptor and transmits a signal through interaction with a heterotrimeric G protein (Fig. 7), leading to the activation of Ras (44van Corven E.J. Hordijk P.L.

Partially purified MAP kinase from LPA-stimulated WB rat cells was shown to phosphorylate a Cx43 peptide, aa 247–260, that contained the Ser255 site (43Hii C.S.T. Oh S.-Y. Schmidt S.A. Clark K.J. Murray A.W. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 475-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Zhao et al. (45Zhao Z. Tan Z. Diltz C.D. You M. Fischer E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22251-22255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) have reported that treating cells with pervanadate (a potent inhibitor of tyrosine phosphatases) was sufficient to trigger the activation of Raf, MEK, and MAP kinase (Fig. 7). Pervanadate dramatically increased the overall level of tyrosine phosphorylation on cellular proteins in the treated HeLa cells. Pervanadate has also been reported to down-regulate GJC and to increase phosphorylation on Cx43 in studies with hamster lung fibroblasts (46Husoy T. Mikalsen S.-O. Sanner T. Carcinogenesis. 1993; 14: 2257-2265Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In the studies reported here, we have directly examined the role of MAP kinase in mediating the EGF-induced increased phosphorylation of Cx43in vivo. We expressed wild type (wt) and mutant forms of Cx43 in communication-deficient cells and examined the effects of EGF, LPA, and pervanadate on Cx43 phosphorylation in the presence or absence of a specific MEK inhibitor. Compound PD98059 has been demonstrated to block MEK activation in many cells ((47, 48) Fig. 7) and thus prevent the MEK-mediated phosphorylation of MAP kinase at the Thr183 and Tyr185 sites that are essential for MAP kinase activity (49Robbins D.J. Zhen E. Owaki H. Vanderbilt C.A. Ebert D. Geppert T.D. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5097-5106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our studies have demonstrated that Cx43 is a target of the MAP kinase signaling pathway in vivo and that the activation of MAP kinase decreases Cx43-mediated junctional conductance and permeability. These studies demonstrate that phosphorylation on one or more of the MAP kinase consensus serine phosphorylation sites is responsible for the disruption of GJC. The Cx43 knock-out (K/O) mouse cell line, −/−3 (29Martyn K.D. Kurata W.E. Warn-Cramer B.J. Burt J.M. TenBroek E. Lau A.F. Cell Growth Differ. 1997; 8: 1015-1027PubMed Google Scholar), human HeLa cells, and K/O or HeLa cells expressing exogenous Cx43 were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) with 10% fetal calf serum (Hyclone) in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C as described (29Martyn K.D. Kurata W.E. Warn-Cramer B.J. Burt J.M. TenBroek E. Lau A.F. Cell Growth Differ. 1997; 8: 1015-1027PubMed Google Scholar). Confluent monolayers were metabolically labeled for 2–3 h with [35S]methionine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at 100 μCi/ml in methionine-free basal minimum Eagle's medium supplemented with 4% calf serum. The MEK inhibitor (PD98059, New England Biolabs) or dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) control was used to pretreat cells for 1 h prior to stimulation with EGF, LPA, or pervanadate as described below. Cells were treated with EGF, LPA, or pervanadate during the last 15–30 min of the labeling period. At the end of the labeling period, the monolayers were rinsed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 10 mm NaF, 160 μm Na3VO4, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) and then frozen at −20 °C. Cells were lysed on ice with RIPA buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 10 mmTris (pH 7.2)) containing phosphatase and protease inhibitors (10 mm NaF, 160 μmNa3VO4, and 1 mm PMSF). Cx43 was immunoprecipitated from clarified cell lysates with rabbit antiserum directed against the carboxyl-terminal of Cx43 (aa 368–382) and activated protein A-Staphylococcus aureus (41Warn-Cramer B.J.

Controls for nonspecific immunoprecipitation were performed with half of each cell lysate using non-immune rabbit serum. Immunoprecipitates were resolved on SDS-polyacrylamide gradient gels (7.5–15% acrylamide), and radiolabeled Cx43 was visualized by radioautography of the dried fluorographed gels. For phosphoamino acid analysis, cell monolayers were labeled for 2–3 h with 32Pi (NEN Life Science Products, NEX-053) at 1–2 mCi/ml in phosphate-free basal minimum Eagle's medium with 4% calf serum. Cx43 was immunoprecipitated from clarified cell lysates, resolved on gradient gels, and transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore). Phosphorylated Cx43 was visualized by radioautography, excised from the membrane, acid-hydrolyzed, lyophilized, and mixed with non-radioactive internal phosphoamino acid standards. Phosphoamino acids were resolved by two-dimensional electrophoresis at pH 1.9 and pH 3.5 on thin layer cellulose plates as described (50Kamps M.P. Sefton B.M. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 176: 22-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Migration of the phosphoamino acid standards was visualized with ninhydrin prior to radioautography at −70 °C. The EcoRI insert containing the G2 rat Cx43 gene with 5′ and 3′ non-coding sequences (51Beyer E.C. Paul D.L. Goodenough D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 2621-2629Crossref PubMed Scopus (919) Google Scholar) was excised from Bluescript with BamHI and SalI and inserted into the pBABE retroviral vector (52Morgenstern J.P. Land H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3587-3596Crossref PubMed Scopus (1900) Google Scholar). The pBABE-Cx43 DNA was transfected into the PE501 packaging cell line using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Virus from the PE501 cells was amplified by infecting a second packaging cell line, PA317. The PE501 and PA317 packing cell lines were generously provided by Dr. Dusty Miller (53Miller A.D. Miller D.G. Garcdia J.V. Kynch C.M. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 217: 581-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). Virus harvested from the PA317 cells was used to infect Cx43 K/O cells or HeLa cells. Infected cells were selected using puromycin (6 μg/ml for the K/O cells or 0.5 μg/ml for the HeLa cells) and subcloned by limiting dilution. Mutant forms of Cx43 were prepared from double-stranded DNA using the Chameleon site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) with primers designed to alter a serine residue(s) to alanine or to aspartate (41Warn-Cramer B.J. Lampe P.D. Kurata W.E. Kanemitsu M.Y. Loo L.W.M. Eckhart W. Lau A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3779-3786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Selection for mutants was provided by the simultaneous use of a selection primer designed to eliminate a restriction site in the plasmid DNA (54Deng W.P. Nickoloff J.A. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 200: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar). The fidelity of the mutants was confirmed by sequencing the full-length Cx43 DNA. The K/O cell clone expressing wt Cx43 used in this study (clone G3) has been characterized previously ((29), termed clone 3R2). A second wt clone was also used for the GJC and junctional conductance studies (clone C9). The K/O cell clone, G11, expressing the S255A,S279A,S282A Cx43 mutant was used for most of these studies. Unless otherwise noted all data reported are for this clone. However, some results were also obtained with a second S255A,S279A,S282A Cx43 mutant clone, H5. The HeLa cell clones expressing wt Cx43 or the S255D Cx43 mutant used in this study were clones A7–A12 and C2-A5, respectively. Clones stably expressing wt Cx43 or mutant Cx43 were initially screened for membrane-localized protein in punctate gap junctions by immunofluorescence microscopy. Cells were grown overnight on glass coverslips, rinsed with PBS, and fixed in ice-cold 100% methanol for 30 min at −20 °C. Cell membranes were permeabilized with 1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min, rinsed twice with PBS, and blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS. The coverslips were then incubated with rabbit anti-Cx43 at 1:1000 dilution in 1% BSA/PBS for 1 h at room temperature, rinsed twice with PBS and twice with 1% BSA/PBS, and then incubated with goat anti-rabbit fluorescein isothiocyanate conjugate (Sigma), 1:70 for 1 h in the dark. Coverslips were rinsed three times with PBS, mounted on glass slides with 50% glycerol, 50% PBS containing 0.1% phenylenediamine (Sigma), and visualized using a Zeiss Axioplan Universal microscope equipped with epifluorescence. The membrane-impermeant fluorescent dye, Lucifer Yellow (Sigma), was used to characterize cell clones for GJC (transfer of dye from a microinjected cell to neighboring cells) and to monitor GJC in treated cells. Single cells were microinjected with 10% (w/v) Lucifer Yellow dye (457 Da) in 330 mm LiCl with a glass micropipette (Flaming-Brown P80/PC micropipette puller, Sutton Instrument Co.) using an Eppendorf micromanipulator and Eppendorf pneumatic injector. Dye transfer to neighboring cells was determined after ∼3 min using a Zeiss Axiovert 10 phase contrast inverted microscope equipped with epifluorescence. Approximately 85% of the K/O cells expressing wt Cx43 or the S255A,S279A,S282A Cx43 mutant communicated to neighboring cells, and all injections were used to determine the mean value for GJC. Approximately 60% of the HeLa cells expressing wt Cx43 or the S255D Cx43 mutant communicated. Only those injections that resulted in dye transfer to at least one other cell were used to determine the mean value for GJC. Dye transfer was determined in the cells treated with EGF ∼25–30 min after the addition of EGF in injections over ∼15–30 min. C9 cells expressing wt Cx43 or G11 cells expressing the S255A,S279A,S282A Cx43 mutant were trypsinized and replated in culture medium on glass coverslips. After 0.5 h the cells were removed from the incubator and maintained at room temperature in a 5% CO2 in air environment until used for electrophysiological study. Coverslips were mounted in a perfusion chamber, pairs of cells visualized, and patch type microelectrodes lowered onto the surface of each cell. After establishment of the whole cell recording mode, macroscopic junctional conductance was continuously monitored, as described previously (29Martyn K.D. Kurata W.E. Warn-Cramer B.J. Burt J.M. TenBroek E. Lau A.F. Cell Growth Differ. 1997; 8: 1015-1027PubMed Google Scholar), during exposure of the cells to 0 or 100 ng/ml EGF. Confluent 60-mm monolayers were treated with 100 ng/ml recombinant human EGF (U. S. Biochemical Corp. and Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in conditioned medium (or phosphate-deficient or methionine-free media for metabolically labeled cells) for 30 min at 37 °C. Cells were treated with 50 μm LPA (Sigma, 5 mm stock in PBS/1% fatty acid-free BSA) in 1 ml of medium for 15 min at 37 °C. Pervanadate was prepared freshly for each experiment as a 1:1 mix of 100 mm H2O2 and 100 mmNa3VO4, incubated at room temperature for 10–20 min prior to addition to the monolayers in 1 ml of medium (final concentration 100 μm pervanadate). Cells were incubated with pervanadate for 20 min at 37 °C. To block MEK activation, cells were treated with 50 μm PD98059 (50 mm stock in Me2SO) for 1 h at 37 °C prior to stimulation with EGF, LPA, or pervanadate. Controls for these experiments were treated with 0.1% Me2SO. Following treatment, cells were used for GJC measurements or the monolayers were rinsed twice with cold PBS containing 10 mm NaF, 160 μmNa3VO4, 1 mm PMSF and stored frozen. Metabolically labeled cells were treated with the MEK inhibitor or Me2SO, and EGF, LPA, or pervanadate during the last part of the labeling period. Confluent monolayers were pretreated with MEK inhibitor or Me2SO (control) for 1 h at 37 °C and then stimulated with EGF. At the end of the treatment time, the monolayers were rinsed twice with cold PBS with phosphatase and protease inhibitors (10 mm NaF, 160 μmNa3VO4, and 1 mm PMSF) and frozen at −70 °C. In vitro MAP kinase assays were carried out with clarified cell lysates (in RIPA buffer with 10 mm NaF, 160 μm Na3VO4, and 1 mm PMSF). Reactions contained 7.5 μl of the cell lysate (2.5 ml of lysate for a 60-mm plate) and 15 μl kinase reaction buffer. Final concentrations in the reaction were 20 mmHEPES (pH 7.4), 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 20 μm unlabeled ATP, 0.5 mg/ml myelin basic protein (MBP, Sigma) as a MAP kinase substrate, and 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 20 min and stopped by addition of 7.5 μl of 4× SDS sample buffer and placing the samples in boiling water. Proteins were resolved on 12% acrylamide SDS-polyacrylamide gels and stained with Coomassie Blue. The gels were dried and radioautographed at −70 °C. Confluent monolayers in 35-mm dishes were treated with 0.1% Me2SO or MEK inhibitor (50 μm) for 1 h and then treated with or without EGF (100 ng/ml) for 2 min. At the end of the treatment period, the monolayers were rinsed with cold PBS and frozen at −70 °C. Frozen cells were lysed in 100 μl of hot SDS sample buffer, heated in boiling water, and centrifuged for 30 min in an Eppendorf microcentrifuge. The supernatant proteins (30 μl) were resolved on 12% acrylamide SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to Immobilon (Millipore). The membrane was blocked with 5% BSA in PBS, 0.1% Tween and incubated with an antibody specific for the active, phosphorylated form of MAP kinase (Promega) or with an antibody to p42 MAP kinase (Santa Cruz). Immunoblots were developed with a peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody using the ECL chemiluminescence system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Previous studies implicated MAP kinase in mediating the EGF-induced phosphorylation of Cx43 and the accompanying disruption of GJC (30Lau A.F. Kanemitsu M.Y. Kurata W.E. Danesh S. Boynton A.L. Mol.

https://openalex.org/W2090650873,"Stable transduction of mammalian cells typically involves random integration of viral vectors by non-homologous recombination. Here we report that vectors based on adeno-associated virus (AAV) can efficiently modify homologous human chromosomal target sequences. Both integrated neomycin phosphotransferase genes and the hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase gene were targeted by AAV vectors. Site-specific genetic modifications could be introduced into approximately 1% of cells, with the highest targeting rates occurring in normal human fibroblasts. These results suggest that AAV vectors could be used to introduce specific genetic changes into the genomic DNA of a wide variety of mammalian cells, including therapeutic gene targeting applications."
https://openalex.org/W1997916071,"Mouse melanoma B16 cells are characterized by the predominant presence of ganglioside GM3 and adhere to lactosylceramide- or Gg3-coated plates through interaction of GM3 with lactosylceramide or Gg3, whereby not only adhesion but also spreading and enhancement of cell motility occur (Kojima, N., Hakomori, S. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 17552–17558). We now report that the adhesion process is based essentially on a glycosphingolipid-enriched microdomain (GEM) at the B16 cell surface, since >90% of GM3 present in the original cells is found in GEM, and GEM is also enriched in several signal transducer molecules, e.g. c-Src, Ras, Rho, and focal adhesion kinase (FAK). GEM was isolated as a low density membranous fraction by homogenization of B16 cells in lysis buffer under two different conditions (i.e. buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, or hypertonic sodium carbonate without detergent), followed by sucrose density gradient centrifugation. A close association of GM3 with c-Src, Rho, and FAK was indicated by co-immunoprecipitation of GM3 present in GEM by anti-GM3 monoclonal antibody DH2, followed by Western blotting with antibodies directed to these transducer molecules. The following data indicate that GEM is a structural and functional unit for initiation of GM3-dependent cell adhesion coupled with signal transduction. 1) Tyrosine phosphorylation in FAK was greatly enhanced in B16 cells adhered to Gg3-coated plates but was minimal in cells adhered to GM3-coated, GlcCer-coated, or noncoated plates. 2) GTP loading on Ras and Rho increased significantly when cells were adhered to Gg3-coated plates, compared with GM3-coated, GlcCer-coated, or noncoated plates. Since Ras and Rho are closely associated with GM3 in GEM, cell adhesion/stimulation through GM3 in GEM may induce activation of Ras and Rho through enhanced GTP binding.

GSLs at the cell surface are also involved in cell adhesion through several different mechanisms: 1) GSLs interact with integrin receptors such as α5β1 and αvβ3 to enhance their function (9Cheresh D.A.

Glycobiology. 1991; 1: 623-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Mouse melanoma B16 cells adhered, spread, and showed enhanced motility on LacCer- or Gg3-coated plates through GM3-LacCer or GM3-Gg3 interaction (18Kojima N. Hakomori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17552-17558Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 2Glycosphingolipids are abbreviated according to the recommendations of the IUPAC-IUB Commission on Biochemical Nomenclature (60IUPAC-IUB Commission on Biochemical Nomenclature Lipids. 1977; 12: 455-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar); however, the suffix -OseCer is omitted. Gangliosides are abbreviated according to Svennerholm (61Svennerholm L. J. Lipid Res. 1964; 5: 145-155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This process, hereby termed “GM3-dependent adhesion,” mimics adhesion of B16 cells to mouse endothelial cells that express LacCer and Gg3 (24Kojima N. Shiota M. Sadahira Y. Handa K. Hakomori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17264-17270Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and is regarded as an essential step in melanoma cell metastasis (25Otsuji E. Park Y.S. Tashiro K. Kojima N. Toyokuni T. Hakomori S. Int. J. Oncol. 1995; 6: 319-327PubMed Google Scholar). Specific interaction between GM3 and LacCer was confirmed recently by measurement of molecular force (26Leckband D. Yu Z.-W. Ding S. Guo Y. Glycoconj. J. 1997; 14: S31Google Scholar). To understand the molecular mechanism of GSL function, it is essential to clarify the organizational status of GSLs at the cell surface membrane. We found previously that GM3 is particularly enriched in detergent-insoluble substrate attachment matrix (DISAM), and that GSLs in general are enriched in detergent-insoluble material (DIM), when cell monolayer is treated with zwitterionic detergent (27Okada Y. Mugnai G. Bremer E.G. Hakomori S. Exp. Cell Res. 1984; 155: 448-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Around the same time, Young, Tillack, and co-workers observed that GSLs are clustered to form microdomains at the cell surface (28Tillack T.W. Allietta M. Moran R.E. Young W.W.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 733: 15-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) or even at the liposome surface (29Rock P. Allietta M. Young W.W.J. Thompson T.E. Tillack T.W. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 8484-8490Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Increasing evidence for identity or partial overlap of chemical composition and function between DIM and clustered GSLs, i.e. GSL-enriched microdomains (GEM), has emerged from numerous studies during the past decade. For example, Brown and Rose (30Brown D.A. Rose J.K. Cell. 1992; 68: 533-544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2610) Google Scholar) observed that GSLs and glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors, along with sphingomyelin and cholesterol, are enriched in the apical surface (but not basolateral surface) of epithelial cells and are associated with low-density, detergent-insoluble vesicles equivalent to DIM. Association of DIM with Src family protein kinase p62yesin Madin-Darby canine kidney cells has been clearly demonstrated (31Arreaza G. Melkonian K.A. LaFevre-Bernt M. Brown D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19123-19127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A subdomain similar to but distinguishable from GEM has been found as an invagination of plasma membrane, termed “caveolae,” which is characterized by a specific coating membrane protein (caveolin) withMr 21,000 (32Rothberg K.G. Heuser J.E. Donzell W.C. Ying Y.-S. Glenney J.R. Anderson R.G.W. Cell. 1992; 68: 673-682Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1868) Google Scholar). Caveolae play a role in endocytosis independent of clathrin-coated pits, as well as in growth factor-mediated signal transduction (33Liu P. Ying Y. Ko Y.-G. Anderson R.G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10299-10303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar, 34Mineo C. James G.L. Smart E.J. Anderson R.G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11930-11935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). Many other findings as detailed in reviews (35Simons K. van Meer G. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 6197-6202Crossref PubMed Scopus (1090) Google Scholar, 36Parton R.G. Simons K. Science. 1995; 269: 1398-1399Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 37Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (8117) Google Scholar) suggest that DIM, GEM, and caveolae are similar but distinguishable in terms of membrane components and organization and represent specific subdomains of plasma membrane. Specific binding of GM3 to epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase (4Hanai N. Nores G.A. MacLeod C. Torres-Mendez C.-R. Hakomori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 10915-10921Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and of GM1 to Trk A kinase (7Mutoh T. Tokuda A. Miyada T. Hamaguchi M. Fujiki N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5087-5091Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar) indicates a close association of specific GSLs with specific tyrosine kinases. This idea was further supported by the fact that nonreceptor Src family tyrosine kinase Lyn in rat basophilic leukemia cells is co-immunoprecipitated with α-Gal-GM1 (38Minoguchi K. Swaim W.D. Berenstein E.H. Sirganian R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5249-5254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and Lyn in rat brain is co-immunoprecipitated with ganglioside GD3 (39Kasahara K. Watanabe Y. Yamamoto T. Sanai Y. Glycobiology. 1996; 6: 752Google Scholar). See “Discussion” regarding the functional significance of this association. The current study on mouse B16 melanoma cells indicates that 1) GEM and DIM are enriched in not only GSLs but also multiple transducer molecules (e.g. c-Src, Rho, Ras, FAK, etc.) and 2) GM3-dependent cell adhesion to Gg3-coated plates through GM3-Gg3 interaction induces signal transduction through changes in transducer molecules associated with GEM. This paper is concerned with changes of FAK and GDP/GTP binding to Ras and Rho. GM3 was prepared from dog erythrocytes. Its specific mAb, DH2 (IgG3), was established as described previously (40Dohi T. Nores G. Hakomori S. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 5680-5685PubMed Google Scholar). Specific polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies suitable for Western immunoblotting and directed to various transducer molecules such as c-Src, Ha-Ras, RhoA, FAK, Gαs, and phospholipase C-β2 were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Antibodies directed to c-Src, FAK, and phospholipase C-β2 were rabbit polyclonal; antibody directed to RhoA was mouse monoclonal (IgG1); and antibody directed to Ha-Ras was rat monoclonal (IgG1). Two methods were employed: one with lysis buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, the other with hypertonic sodium carbonate medium. Cells were harvested in 0.02% EDTA (∼7 mm), lysed, homogenized, and subjected to sucrose density gradient centrifugation to separate low density light-scattering membranous fraction according to a modification of the method described previously (41Rodgers W. Rose J.K. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1515-1523Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1–5 × 107cells were suspended in 1 ml of lysis buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, and 75 units of aprotinin and allowed to stand for 20 min. When a phosphorylation assay was included, 1 mmNaVO4 was added to inhibit phosphatase. The cell suspension was Dounce-homogenized with 10 strokes, and the lysate was centrifuged for 5 min at 1300 × g to remove nuclei and large cellular debris. The supernatant fraction (postnuclear fraction) was subjected to sucrose density gradient centrifugation, i.e.the fraction was mixed with an equal volume of 85% sucrose (w/v) containing 10 mm Tris buffer (pH 7.5), 150 mmNaCl, 5 mm EDTA, with or without 1 mmNaVO4 (Tris-NaCl-EDTA buffer). The resulting diluent was placed at the bottom of a sucrose concentration gradient with Tris-NaCl-EDTA buffer. Samples were centrifuged for 18 h at 200,000 × g at 4 °C. A white light-scattering band under light illumination (presumably due to the Tyndall phenomenon of the membranous fraction) located at ∼5–7% sucrose was separated from other fractions at different sucrose concentrations (see Fig. 1). The entire procedure was performed at 0–4 °C (in ice immersion). The protein content of each fraction was determined using a MicroBCA kit (Pierce). The original method (42Song K.S. Li S. Okamoto T. Quilliam L.A. Sargiacomo M. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9690-9697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (920) Google Scholar) was modified as follows. Cells were scraped in 500 mmsodium carbonate, pH 11.0 (2–4 × 107 cells/2 ml) and homogenized using a loose fitting Dounce homogenizer (20 strokes), a Polytron tissue grinder (three 10-s bursts), and a bath sonicator (three 20-s bursts). 1.5 ml of the cell homogenate thus obtained was placed at the bottom of an ultracentrifuge tube and mixed with an equal volume of 90% sucrose (w/v) in 25 mm MES, pH 6.5, 0.15m NaCl (MBS) and overlaid with 4 ml of 35% sucrose and 4 ml of 5% sucrose (both in MBS containing 250 mm sodium carbonate). Samples were submitted to ultracentrifugation as described above, and the light-scattering band just above the 5–35% sucrose interface was collected and designated as the GEM fraction (see Fig. 1). The protein content of each fraction was determined as described above. GEM fraction was dialyzed against PBS (8.1 mmol/liter Na2HPO4, 1.5 mmol/liter KH2PO4, 2.7 mmol/liter KCl, 137 mmol/liter NaCl, pH 7.2) and centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 5 min. The pellet was resuspended in half-strength Karnovsky's fixative (43Karnovsky M.J. J. Cell Biol. 1965; 27: 137Google Scholar) for 4–6 h, rinsed in 0.1 m cacodylate buffer, postfixed in 1% collodine-buffered osmium tetroxide, dehydrated in graded ethanol and propylene oxide, infiltrated, and embedded in Epon 812. Sections (∼70–90 nm) were stained using saturated aqueous uranyl acetate and lead tartrate. Photographs were taken using a JEOL 100SX transmission electron microscope operating at 80 kV. GEM and other fractions were separated by sucrose density gradient centrifugation in medium containing detergent or hypertonic sodium carbonate free from detergent, as described under “Preparation of GM3-enriched Microdomain from B16 Melanoma.” Each fraction was subjected to analysis of GM3 and various transducers. Each fraction was dialyzed against distilled water to eliminate sucrose and lyophilized. The residue was extracted with chloroform-methanol (2:1), placed on a high performance TLC plate, developed, and immunostained using anti-GM3 mAb DH2 and Vectastain ABC kit (Vector, Burlingame, CA) as described previously (44Mårtensson S. Brodin T. Carlström A.-S. Dahmen J. Frejd T. Gunnarsson A. Jansson U. Magnusson G. Lundblad A. Glycoconj. J. 1986; 3: 163-174Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar), i.e. using biotinylated goat anti-mouse Ig as secondary antibody. Final TLC staining was made with metal-enhanced DAB substrate (Pierce). The GM3 band on TLC was also examined by orcinol-sulfuric acid staining. GEM and other protein fractions were subjected to SDS-PAGE with Western immunoblotting;i.e. protein bands separated on SDS-PAGE were transferred electrophoretically to PVDF membranes (Immobilon-P, Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) in 25 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine, and 15% methanol at 200 mA for 2 h. The membranes were incubated overnight at 4 °C in PBS containing 5% defatted milk, washed in PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20, and incubated for 2 h with various antibodies directed to specific transducers. After incubation with primary antibody with appropriate dilution (see Fig. 2 legend), the membrane was washed twice in PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 and incubated with goat anti-rabbit, anti-rat, or anti-mouse Ig conjugated with horseradish peroxidase for 45 min for detection of rabbit, rat, or mouse primary antibodies. The membrane was washed five times in PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 and developed using the chemiluminescence method with a substrate kit (Super-SignalTM-CL-HRP; Pierce). Approximately 500 μl of GEM (containing 25–30 μg of protein) was mixed with protein A-Sepharose beads (50 μl, packed) and stirred by a rotary shaker for 2 h at 4 °C to preclear nonspecific binding. After centrifugation (500 × g for 1 min), the supernatant was added with 10–20 μl of anti-GM3 mAb DH2 ascites or with 10–20 μl of mouse myeloma SP-2 or NS/1 ascites as negative control. The mixtures were placed overnight in a rotary mixer at 4 °C, added with protein A-Sepharose beads (50 μl, packed), and placed again in a rotary mixer for 2 h. Beads were washed three times with PBS containing 0.01% Tween 20, by brief weak centrifugation (500 × g for 1 min) and then suspended with 100 μl of sample buffer with mercaptoethanol, heated to 95 °C for 3 min, and centrifuged (1000 × g for 2 min). The supernatants were subjected to SDS-PAGE, transferred electrophoretically to PVDF membranes, and incubated with various antibodies directed to specific transducer molecules, under the same conditions as described under “Determination of Transducers.” Transducer molecules were detected with secondary antibody by the chemiluminescence method as described above. B16 melanoma cells, characterized by abundance of GM3, adhere, spread, and show enhanced motility on Gg3- or LacCer-coated plates; this phenomenon is based essentially on interaction of GM3 on B16 cells with Gg3 or LacCer on the plates (17Kojima N. Hakomori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20159-20162Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Kojima N. Hakomori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17552-17558Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and is referred to here as “GM3-dependent adhesion.” To follow time course changes of signal transduction caused by GM3-dependent adhesion, the following experimental design was used. 770 μl of GM3, Gg3, or GlcCer solution (containing 100 μg/ml ethanol) was added to 6-cm diameter tissue culture plates and dried. As a control, the same volume of ethanol was added to culture plates and dried. Plates were precoated with GM3, Gg3, or GlcCer, and each plate was added with a 3-ml aliquot of B16 cell suspension in serum-free DMEM (106 cells). Several plates were stacked in a special plate holder (adaptable to a Beckman centrifuge), centrifuged at 400 rpm for 1 min at room temperature, and then immediately incubated at 37 °C in a CO2 incubator for 5, 10, 20, 30, or 60 min (defined as duration of cell adhesion). Cells were then placed on ice, harvested by rubber, and centrifuged. Cell pellets were analyzed for the levels of FAK and tyrosine phosphate associated with FAK and for the GTP/GDP ratio associated with Rho and Ras (see below). To block the effect of interaction of Gg3 (coated on plates) with GM3 (expressed on B16 cells), Gg3-coated plates were incubated with 2 ml (3 μg/ml) of anti-Gg3 IgM mAb 2D4 (45Young W.W.J. MacDonald E.M.S. Nowinski R.C. Hakomori S. J. Exp. Med. 1979; 150: 1008-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) or (as negative control) IgM mAb AH6 directed to unrelated structure Ley (46Abe K. McKibbin J.M. Hakomori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 11793-11797Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) for 1 h at room temperature. Plates were washed with PBS, and B16 cells were added by centrifugation and incubated in serum-free DMEM at 37 °C for 30 min. Cells were detached, and the levels of FAK and its tyrosine phosphorylation were determined as described above. Since adherence of B16 cells on Gg3-coated solid phase was inhibited by anti-GM3 (18Kojima N. Hakomori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17552-17558Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the effect of anti-GM3 on levels of FAK and its tyrosine phosphate were determined. The detached cells were suspended in serum-free DMEM at 1 × 106 cells/3 ml and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in the presence of 2 μg/ml DH2 or normal mouse IgG. Subsequently, the reaction was stopped in an ice bath, and an equal volume of ice-cold PBS containing 1 mmNaVO4 was added. Cells were lysed, and we followed the procedure to determine FAK and FAK-associated tyrosine phosphorylation as described above. Cells stimulated through adhesion to Gg3-coated plates or control cells added on GM3- or GlcCer-coated plates as described above were lysed in 0.5 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm NaF, 1 mmEDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm NaVO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 75 units/ml aprotinin, 1% Triton X-100) by sonicating for 10 × 0.1 s (Sonifier 450, Branson Ultrasonic Corp., Danbury, CT). Aliquots of lysate containing the same quantity of protein (∼100 μg) were boiled for 5 min in SDS-PAGE sample buffer containing 5% 2-mercaptoethanol and electrophoresed on 8% SDS-PAGE, and electrophoresed proteins were transferred to PVDF membranes (Immobilon-P, Millipore). The PVDF membranes were treated with 5% defatted milk in TBS (10 mmTris/HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl) containing 0.05% Tween 20 for 1 h at room temperature and incubated with rabbit anti-FAK polyclonal IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 2 h at room temperature. The membranes were washed three times with TBS containing 0.05% Tween 20, incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG for 1 h at room temperature, washed five times with TBS/Tween 20, and developed by the chemiluminescence method with a substrate kit (Super-Signal™-CL-HRP; Pierce). To determine the level of tyrosine phosphate associated with FAK, FAK was isolated from the cell lysate by immunoprecipitation. Briefly, ∼400 μl of cell lysate (containing 20–30 μg of protein) was mixed with protein A/G-agarose beads (10 μl, packed; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and rotated for 2 h at 4 °C. After centrifugation (1300 × g for 5 min), the supernatant was added with 2 μl of 100 μg/ml mouse anti-FAK mAb 77 (IgG1, Transduction Laboratories), rotated overnight at 4 °C, and then incubated with protein A/G-agarose beads (10 μl, packed) for 2 h at 4 °C. The mixture was centrifuged at 1300 × g for 5 min, and pelleted beads were washed five times with TBS/Tween 20 and boiled 5 min in SDS-PAGE sample buffer containing 5% 2-mercaptoethanol. The FAK content of each SDS-PAGE sample was measured by Western blotting using an Ultroscan XL densitometer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Samples containing equal amounts of FAK were run on 8% SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membranes. The membranes were probed with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-tyrosine phosphate mAb PY20 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and developed using the chemiluminescence method, followed by densitometric analysis. The original method for determination of GTP and GDP binding to Ras (47Downward J. Graves J.D. Warne P.H. Rayter S. Cantrell D.A. Nature. 1990; 346: 719-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar) was modified at step 3 as below (treatment of eluate from gel beads), since otherwise its application to Ras and Rho in B16 cells did not give high reproducibility. After culturing of cells in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, medium was replaced with phosphate-free, serum-free DMEM for 4 h. [32P]Phosphate (1 mCi/25-cm2 flask) was added to the medium under serum-free conditions, and culture was continued for 17 h. Cultured cells were washed five times with TBS, detached with 0.02% EDTA solution, and then resuspended in serum-free DMEM. Three ml of labeled cells (1 × 106 cells) were attached by low centrifugation (400 rpm for 1 min) on plates coated with Gg3, GlcCer, GM3, or no coating. The plates were then incubated for 20 min at 37 °C, and the reaction was stopped by placement on ice and the addition of 3 ml of ice-cold PBS. Cells were harvested by rubber, suspended in 0.5 ml of HEPES lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 20 mm MgCl2, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% Nonidet P-40), and Dounce-homogenized 10 strokes. After centrifugation at 1300 ×g for 5 min, the supernatant was precleared with 100 μl/ml bovine serum albumin-coated charcoal for 10 min at 4 °C and then centrifuged again. Supernatants were further precleared by incubation with protein A/G-agarose beads (10 μl, packed) for 1 h at 4 °C, centrifuged at 1300 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, and incubated with 1 μg/ml polyclonal or monoclonal anti-Ha-Ras or anti-RhoA antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or with 1 μg/ml normal mouse IgG as control, overnight at 4 °C. The incubation mixtures were added with protein A/G-agarose beads (10 μl, packed) and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed sequentially with buffer A (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 500 mm KCl, 20 mm MgCl2) and buffer B (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 500 mm NaCl, 20 mm MgCl2), resuspended in elution buffer (20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2% SDS, 1 mm GTP, 1 mm GDP), heated at 65 °C for 5 min, and centrifuged. The resultant supernatant was treated with 10% trichloroacetic acid and centrifuged at 10,000 ×g for 5 min at 4 °C. Precipitate was discarded, and supernatant was mixed with 400 μl of ether and shaken to extract trichloroacetic acid, and this procedure was repeated twice more. The upper ether layers were discarded, and aqueous lower layers were evaporated by Speed-Vac® (Savant, Farmingdale, NY). The dried residue was dissolved in 10 μl of water and spotted on Ecteola cellulose plates, which were then developed with 0.75 mKH2PO4 (pH 3.5). GDP and GTP spots, visualized by fluorescence quenching under ultraviolet light and by autoradiography, were cut, and radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting"

We have altered the equivalent Ser-183 and Tyr-185 in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Rieske iron-sulfur protein by site-directed mutagenesis of the iron-sulfur protein gene to examine how these hydrogen bonds affect the midpoint potential of the iron-sulfur cluster and how changes in the midpoint potential affect the activity of the enzyme.Eliminating the hydrogen bond from the hydroxyl group of Ser-183 to S-1 of the cluster lowers the midpoint potential of the cluster by 130 mV, and eliminating the hydrogen bond from the hydroxyl group of Tyr-185 to Sγ of Cys-159 lowers the midpoint potential by 65 mV. Eliminating both hydrogen bonds has an approximately additive effect, lowering the midpoint potential by 180 mV. Thus, these hydrogen bonds contribute significantly to the positive midpoint potential of the cluster but are not essential for its assembly. The activity of thebc1 complex decreases with the decrease in midpoint potential, confirming that oxidation of ubiquinol by the iron-sulfur protein is the rate-limiting partial reaction in thebc1 complex, and that the rate of this reaction is extensively influenced by the midpoint potential of the iron-sulfur cluster.

The Rieske iron-sulfur protein is a ubiquitous component of cytochrome bc1 complexes (1Rieske J.S. MacLennan D.H. Coleman R. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

The electronic environment of the [2Fe-2S] cluster in the Rieske iron-sulfur protein differs from that in plant type [2Fe-2S] ferredoxins as evidenced by a distinct EPR spectrum (1Rieske J.S. MacLennan D.H. Coleman R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1964; 15: 338-344Crossref Scopus (162) Google Scholar) and a redox midpoint potential of the Rieske protein (e.g. +280 mV) that is much more positive than the midpoint potentials typical of the ferredoxins (e.g. −420 mV; Ref. 2Trumpower B.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 639: 129-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The high midpoint potential of the iron-sulfur cluster is essential for the function of the Rieske protein in the Q cycle mechanism of the bc1 complex (7Mitchell P. J. Theor. Biol. 1976; 62: 327-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (927) Google Scholar, 8Brandt U. Trumpower B.L. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1994; 29: 165-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar), in which the Rieske protein is the primary electron acceptor and drives the electron transfer reaction by oxidizing ubiquinol and divergently transferring one electron to cytochrome c1, while the ubisemiquinone that is formed from ubiquinol reduces the low potential b heme. Recently, the crystal structure of the water-soluble part of the Rieske iron-sulfur protein of bovine heart mitochondrialbc1 complex has been elucidated at 1.5 Å (9Link T.A. Saynovits M. Assmann C. Iwata S. Ohnishi T. von Jagow G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 237: 71-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar,10Iwata S. Saynovits M. Link T.A. Michel H. Structure. 1996; 4: 567-579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Ten β strands form three layers of anti-parallel β sheets in a flat spherical molecule as shown in Fig. 1 A. The cluster binding fold is a small domain-like structure comprising approximately 46 residues; it consists of a distorted four-stranded antiparallel β-sheet and three loops. The loops between the strands β4-β5 and β6-β7 each contribute one cysteine and one histidine ligand to the cluster. Cysteine 139 and 158 are ligands of Fe-1 and are buried within the protein. Histidines 141 and 161 are ligands to the redox-active Fe-2 and are completely exposed to the solvent. The loops are cross-linked by a disulfide bridge formed by two additional cysteine residues in each loop. This disulfide bridge forms one side of the cluster binding fold and stabilizes it. The other side of the cluster binding fold is covered by the so called “Pro loop.” From the crystal structure several factors were identified, which contribute to the positive midpoint potential of the Rieske protein, including a net charge of 0/−1 for the oxidized and reduced iron-sulfur cluster, the electronegativity of the histidine ligands, and the proximity of Fe-2 to the surface of the protein. The midpoint potential should also be affected by the complex hydrogen bond network through which the iron-sulfur cluster is linked to the surrounding protein. With the exception of Cys-158, which has only one hydrogen bond to the nitrogen of Cys-160, all sulfur atoms are involved in two hydrogen bonds each. The hydrogen bond network to sulfur atoms includes Ser-163 and Tyr-165. Both residues are located in strand β7 and are conserved in all Rieske iron-sulfur proteins that oxidize ubiquinol and that have been sequenced to date. As shown in Fig. 1 B, the hydroxyl group of Ser-163 is hydrogen-bonded to S-1, at 3.2 Å. The hydroxyl group of Tyr-165 is hydrogen-bonded to the Sγ of Cys-139, a ligand of Fe-1, at 3.1 Å. Both residues are likely to contribute to the positive midpoint potential of the Rieske protein by decreasing the negative charge density around the sulfur atoms through their respective hydrogen bonds. In the present study we have examined the effects of the hydrogen bonds from the hydroxyl of Ser-163 to the internal sulfur atom and from the hydroxyl of Tyr-165 to the sulfur of one of the cysteine ligands on the midpoint potential of the Rieske iron-sulfur cluster by introducing amino acid changes at equivalent positions (Ser-183 and Tyr-185) in the yeast iron-sulfur protein through site-directed mutagenesis of the cloned gene. We show that conservative substitutions that eliminate these two hydrogen bonds lower the midpoint potential, without affecting the stability of the protein, and that these changes are accompanied by decreases in turnover numbers of thebc1 complexes containing the altered forms of the Rieske protein. SDS, acrylamide, and bisacrylamide were from Bio-Rad. Urea and agarose (Ultra Pure) were from Life Technologies, Inc. DNA was isolated from agarose gels using the QIAquick gel extraction kit from QIAGEN. Nytran™ nylon membranes were from Schleicher & Schuell. Glass beads (0.5 mm) were obtained from Biospec Products. Horse heart cytochrome c and the ubiquinone analog 2,3-dimethoxy-5-methyl-6-n-decyl-1–4-benzoquinone were from Sigma. Yeast extract, peptone, bacto-agar, and tryptone were from Difco. The plasmid pGEM3-RIP1, carrying the wild type Saccharomyces cerevisiae Rieske iron-sulfur protein gene, was used for site-directed mutagenesis with theCLONTECH Transformer mutagenesis kit (11Nett J.H. Denke E. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2212-2217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The mutational changes were confirmed by automated sequencing using the Dye Deoxy terminator cycle sequencing kit from Applied Biosystems Inc. APstI/SacI fragment from the mutated pGEM3-RIP1 was then subcloned into the single-copy yeast vector pFL39-RIP1, from which this fragment was removed. Cells of the RIP1 deletion strain JPJ1 were then transformed with the pFL39-RIP1 plasmid carrying the site-directed mutations (12Ito H. Fukuda Y. Murata K. Kimura A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 163-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Yeast cells were grown 2–3 days on synthetic dextrose medium lacking tryptophan. Mitochondrial membranes were isolated as described previously (13Graham L.A. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22485-22492Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by a modified Lowry method (14Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J Farr L.A. Randall R.J. J. Biol.

Membranes were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (16Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1979; 227: 680-685Crossref Scopus (207537) Google Scholar), and iron-sulfur protein and cytochrome c1were detected by Western blotting (17Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44939) Google Scholar) using monoclonal antibodies to yeast iron-sulfur protein and cytochrome c1(13Graham L.A. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22485-22492Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For all of the yeast mutants in which the iron-sulfur protein was detectable by Western blotting of the mitochondrial membranes, the cytochrome bc1 complexes were purified in two different laboratories and by two different methods. In one laboratory the membranes were extracted with dodecyl maltoside and the complexes purified by ion-exchange chromatography (18Ljungdahl P.O. Pennoyer J.D. Robertson D.E. Trumpower B.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 891: 227-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), and in the other laboratory the membranes were extracted with Triton X-100 and purified by hydroxyapatite chromatography (19Geier B.M. Schaegger H. Brandt U. Colson A.M. von Jagow G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 208: 375-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Ubiquinol-cytochromec oxidoreductase activities of mitochondrial membranes and purified cytochrome bc1 complexes were assayed at pH 7.0 and 23 °C using 50 μm2,3-dimethoxy-5-methyl-6-n-decyl-1–4-benzoquinol as substrate and 50 μm horse heart cytochrome c(5Trumpower B.L. Edwards C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 8697-8706Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Reduction of cytochrome c was monitored in an Aminco DW-2A spectrophotometer at 550 versus 539 nm in dual wavelength mode. Turnover numbers of the bc1complexes in situ and of the purified enzymes were calculated on the basis of the concentration of cytochromeb, which was determined from optical spectra of the dithionite reduced minus ferricyanide oxidized samples (20Ljungdahl P.O.

Assays were performed in triplicate, and turnover numbers are expressed as percent of the turnover number of the bc1complex from the wild-type strain. Turnover numbers of the enzyme from the wild-type strain were 200–220 s−1 as reported previously (18Ljungdahl P.O. Pennoyer J.D. Robertson D.E. Trumpower B.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 891: 227-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). CD-monitored redox titrations of isolated cytochromebc1 complexes were performed in an optically transparent thin layer cell with a path length of 0.1 mm built in-house and using a Jasco J-720 spectropolarimeter as described previously (21Link T.A. Hatzfeld O.M. Unalkat P. Shergill J.K. Cammack R. Mason J.R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7546-7552Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The transparent electrode was a pyridine-3-carboxaldehyde thiosemicarbazone modified gold grid with a mesh size of 500 wires/inch and a transmission of 60% (Buckbee-Mears, St. Paul, MN). The potential was controlled through a Wenking MP 95 potentiostat (Bank Elektronik, Clausthal, Germany). To facilitate redox equilibration, methylviologen (E° = −449 mV), anthraquinone-2-sulfonate (E° = −225 mV), 2-hydroxy-1,4-napthoquinone (E° = −145 mV), menadione (E° = −13 mV), duroquinone (E° = +5 mV), phenazine ethosulfate (E° = +55 mV), phenazine methosulfate (E° = +80 mV), trimethyl-1,4-benzoquinone (E° = +99 mV), 1,2-napthoquinone (E° = +144 mV), 2,6-dichlorophenol indophenol (E° = +217 mV),N,N,N′,N′-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine (E° = +276 mV), and ferricyanide (E° = +408 mV) were added at final concentrations of 25 μm each to approximately 0.5 mm cytochrome bc1complex in 100 mm NaCl, 35 mmMOPS, 11 The abbreviations used are: MOPS, 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid; i-ISP, intermediate iron-sulfur protein. 0.025% Triton X-100, pH 7.0. Neither the oxidized nor the reduced form of the mediators showed any CD signal, even at 10-fold higher concentrations. All potentials have been recalculated with reference to the standard hydrogen electrode. Views of the iron-sulfur protein were generated from the crystal structure coordinates of the bovine protein using the molecular graphics program RasMac, version 2.6 (Roger Sayle). Inter-atomic distances were measured, and rotamer positions of the various amino acid substitutions were examined with Swiss PDB-viewer, version 2.2 (Glaxo Institute of Molecular Biology, Geneva, Switzerland). Although this program does not calculate true energy minimization's for substituted amino acids, it does calculate a “score” for each rotamer position of a substituted amino acid according to the empirical formula S = 4X + 3Y + 2Z − nH, where X is the number of clashes with backbone nitrogen or carbon atoms, including the α carbon, Y is the number of clashes with backbone oxygen atoms, Z is the number of clashes with side-chain atoms, and H is the number of potential hydrogen bonds. The amino acid sequences of the bovine and yeast Rieske iron-sulfur proteins are almost identical throughout the region containing the cluster ligands and the “Pro loop” as shown in Fig. 2. The numbering of the two sequences differ by 20, so that Ser-163 in the bovine iron-sulfur protein equals Ser-183 in yeast, and Tyr-165 in the bovine protein equals Tyr-185 in yeast. 2Hereafter, unless explicitly stated otherwise, we will use the numbering system for yeast. Only 6 of the 44 amino acids in the region surrounding the iron-sulfur cluster are not identical in the bovine and yeast proteins, and 5 of these are conservative changes. The only non-conservative change is Glu-169 in the yeast protein versus Asn-149 in the bovine protein. In the bovine crystal structure, this residue is on the surface of the protein, in the loop that extends from the right of the protein in the orientation shown in Fig. 1, and distal from the cluster. It is thus unlikely that this single non-conservative change results in any substantive difference between the boine and yeast proteins. On the basis of the high degree of sequence identity and the similar midpoint potentials and EPR spectra of the yeast and bovine proteins, we expect that the structures of the two proteins are identical in the cluster binding fold. This allows a systematic approach to explore the effects of amino acid changes in the cluster binding fold on the midpoint potential of the iron-sulfur cluster by using the bovine structure as a guide for constructing site-directed mutations in the yeast protein. Ser-183 and Tyr-185 were chosen for site-directed mutagenesis because these residues form hydrogen bonds that are likely to affect the midpoint potential of the iron-sulfur cluster. The hydroxyl group of Ser-183 is hydrogen-bonded to S-1 of the [2Fe-2S] cluster, while the hydroxyl group of Tyr-185 is hydrogen-bonded to the Sγ of Cys-159, a ligand of Fe-1. In previous studies a mutation in the yeast Rieske protein at Ser-183 and a mutation at Tyr-185 were isolated after random mutagenesis. Replacement of Ser-183 by Leu resulted in loss of the iron-sulfur cluster and instability of the protein (22Gatti D. Meinhardt S.W. Ohnishi T. Tzagoloff A. J Mol. Biol. 1989; 205: 421-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). When Tyr-185 in the yeast protein was replaced with Cys, activity of thebc1 complex was also lost, although it was not established whether the iron-sulfur cluster was present (23Graham L.A. Brandt U. Sargent J.S. Trumpower B.L. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1994; 25: 245-257Crossref Scopus (58) Google Scholar). We chose Ala, Cys, or Thr as conservative amino acid substitutions for Ser-183. Replacing Ser with Ala removes the hydrogen bond to S-1 by eliminating the hydroxyl group but minimizes steric and hydrophobicity differences, since the Cβ of Ala is 3.71 Å from S-1, as compared with 3.18 Å for the oxygen of the Ser hydroxyl group. Substitution of Ser with Cys replaces the hydroxyl group with a sulfhydryl group, which is equidistant from S-1, and which could also form a hydrogen bond. We anticipated the possibility that introduction of the sulfhydryl group could result in misfolding of the protein due to formation of a disulfide bond with one of the Cys residues in the cluster binding fold, and thus we have controlled for protein instability by measuring iron-sulfur protein in mitochondrial membranes from the various mutants by Western analysis as shown below. Tyr-185 was replaced by Phe, Trp, His, Leu, Ser, Thr, Arg, or Asp. The Phe substitution eliminates the hydroxyl group and therefore the capability to form a hydrogen bond without further changes in the side chain. Trp and His were chosen because both of these introduce an aromatic side chain with a polar group that conceivably could form a hydrogen bond to Cys-159. Replacement of Tyr with Ser and Thr introduces alternative hydroxylated amino acids, and we estimated whether these could form hydrogen bonds into the cluster. Calculations of the lowest energy rotamers of these substitutions placed both alternative hydroxyl groups 8.85 Å from the Sγ of Cys-159, versus 3.05 Å for the Tyr hydroxyl group. This suggests that formation of a hydrogen bond from either Ser or Thr to the sulfur would require some internal compression of the protein, and the ensuing bond length and strength would likely be different than that formed from Tyr. Arg and Asp were chosen to replace Tyr because they would place positive and negative charges at the bottom of the cluster binding fold, respectively, and these might alter the redox potential of the cluster. The plasmid pGEM3-RIP1 was used as the template for site-directed mutagenesis, after which a PstI/SacI fragment encompassing the mutated site was subcloned into the single-copy yeast expression vector pFL39-RIP1, from which thePstI/SacI fragment of the wild typeRIP1 gene had been removed. The resulting constructs were used to transform JPJ1, a yeast strain in which the endogenousRIP1 gene has been deleted (24Beckmann J.D. Ljungdahl P.O. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 3713-3722Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). JPJ1 has no ubiquinol-cytochrome c oxidoreductase activity and is unable to grow on non-fermentable carbon sources. When JPJ1 is transformed with a single-copy plasmid carrying the wild-type RIP1 gene, activity of the bc1 complex and ability to grow on the non-fermentable carbon source are restored (24Beckmann J.D. Ljungdahl P.O. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 3713-3722Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Transformation of JPJ1 with the single-copy pFL39 plasmid carrying the site-directedrip1 mutants allows characterization of any mutant phenotypes without interference from the iron-sulfur protein encoded by the wild-type RIP1 gene. To monitor effects of the RIP1 mutations on respiratory activity, transformants were grown on solid medium containing ethanol/glycerol at 25, 30, and 37 °C (TableI). Only three mutants, carrying the S183T, Y185F, and Y185W mutations, had sufficient respiratory activity to allow growth (Pet+) at all three temperatures. The other mutations resulted in a petite phenotype (pet−), such that the yeast were unable to grow on ethanol/glycerol at any of the three temperatures. When grown on ethanol/glycerol at 30 °C in liquid culture, the doubling time of the wild-type strain was 3.6 h, and the doubling times of the mutants with the S183T, Y185F, and Y185W forms of the iron-sulfur protein increased to 4.0, 4.4, and 9.2 h, respectively.Table IGrowth phenotypes, midpoint potentials of iron-sulfur clusters, and cytochrome c reductase activities of mitochondrial membranes from yeast strains with mutations in the Rieske iron-sulfur proteinYeast strainPhenotypeEm,7Activity%WTPet++285100S183TPet++25980S183Apet−+15510S183Cpet−ND0Y185FPet++21740Y185WPet++19530Y185Hpet−ND0Y185Lpet−ND0Y185Spet−ND0Y185Tpet−ND0Y185Rpet−ND0Y185Dpet−ND0Y185F, S183Apet−+1052Amino acids are numbered according to the sequence of the yeast protein.

Midpoint potentials are average values determined by potentiometric titrations of purified cytochrome bc1 complexes as shown in Fig. 5. ND, not determined. Measurements of ubiquinol-cytochrome c oxidoreductase activities indicated that mitochondrial membranes from the three mutants able to grow on the non-fermentable carbon source, carrying the S183T, Y185F, and Y185W mutations, had 80%, 40%, and 30% of wild-type activity, respectively (Fig. 3). Mitochondrial membranes from the yeast carrying the S183A mutation and the S183A,Y185F double mutation had 10% and 2% of wild-type cytochrome c reductase activities, but these low activities were insufficient to allow growth on non-fermentable carbon sources. The S183A,Y185F double mutation in the iron-sulfur protein had a larger effect on the ubiquinol-cytochromec activity compared with the single mutations. Membranes from the yeast strains carrying the other iron-sulfur protein mutations possessed no detectable cytochrome c reductase activity. Mitochondrial membranes of JPJ1 expressing the mutated genes from pFL39-RIP1 were assayed for their content of iron-sulfur protein by Western blotting with monoclonal antibodies to iron-sulfur protein, using cytochromec1 as an internal control to establish that equal amounts of mitochondrial protein were loaded onto the gel. As expected, the deletion strain JPJ1 transformed with the pFL39 plasmid lacking any RIP1 gene showed no immunodetectable Rieske protein (Fig. 4). Substitutions of Ser-183 with Ala, Thr, or Cys resulted in essentially wild-type levels of the Rieske protein. Likewise, membranes from yeast expressing the Y185F and Y185W forms of the iron-sulfur protein contained the same amount of iron-sulfur protein as those from cells expressing wild-type protein. Substitutions of Tyr-185 with Arg resulted in a marked decrease in the amount of immunologically detectable iron-sulfur protein similar to that in a previously described pet− mutant, P203S, in which a mutation in the C terminus resulted in a temperature-sensitive protein (Fig. 4 and Ref. 20Ljungdahl P.O. Beckmann J.D. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 3723-3731Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All other substitutions of Tyr-185, including Y185D, Y185H, Y185L, Y185S, and Y185T resulted in essentially undetectable amounts of iron-sulfur protein (Fig. 4). In the reduced state the Rieske protein displays a strong negative CD band at 500 nm, which is free of interfering signals in isolated bc1 complex (21Link T.A. Hatzfeld O.M. Unalkat P. Shergill J.K. Cammack R. Mason J.R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7546-7552Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). We isolated cytochrome bc1 complexes from yeast expressing selected mutated forms of the iron-sulfur protein and monitored the reduction status of the iron-sulfur cluster by CD spectroscopy as the applied redox potential was varied (Fig. 5). From these titrations, we determined the midpoint potentials of the [2Fe-2S] clusters, as shown in Fig. 6.Figure 6Determination of the oxidation-reduction midpoint potentials of the Rieske iron-sulfur clusters by CD-monitored electrochemical redox titrations of bc1 complexes isolated from yeast strains expressing wild-type or mutated forms of the iron-sulfur proteins. The degree of reduction of the Rieske cluster was obtained from the CD intensity at 500 nm and fitted using a single Nernstian curve with n = 1. The data points are as follows: •, wild type enzyme, Em = 279 mV; ○, Y185F, Em = 211 mV; ×, Y185W,Em = 195 mV; □, S183A, Em = 147 mV; ▴, S183A,Y185F, Em = 111 mV.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The midpoint potential of the Rieske iron-sulfur protein in wild-typebc1 complex was +285 mV, in agreement with previously reported values (2Trumpower B.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 639: 129-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The most pronounced effect on midpoint potential from a single exchange was observed with the S183A mutation, which lowered the midpoint potential by 130 mV to +155 mV, coincident with elimination of the hydrogen bond from the Ser-183 hydroxyl group to S-1 of the cluster. Eliminating the hydrogen bond from Tyr-185 to the Sγ of Cys-159 lowered the midpoint potential by approximately 65 mV, to +217 mV. Replacing Tyr-185 with Trp resulted in a slightly greater decrease in midpoint potential, to +195 mV. Notably, replacing both hydrogen bonds by the S183A,Y185F double mutation lowered the midpoint potential by 180 mV to +105 mV, indicating that these two hydrogen bonds have an approximately additive effect on the electronegativity of the cluster. The CD spectrum of the cytochrome bc1 complex isolated from the yeast strain carrying the S183C mutation revealed that this change resulted in the absence of a CD signal from the [2Fe-2S] cluster. The absence of the redox center accounts for the absence of cytochrome c reductase activity in this mutant (Table I), even though the apoprotein is stably present (Fig. 4). In addition to allowing determination of the midpoint potential, CD absorption arising from the iron-sulfur cluster monitors coupling of the iron-sulfur cluster to the chiral protein and the non-planar geometry that depends on the protein environment. The CD spectra in Fig. 5 show that, with the exception of thebc1 complex containing the S183C form of the iron-sulfur protein, in which the iron-sulfur cluster is missing, the shape and intensity of the signature resonance from the iron-sulfur cluster in the 500 nm region is not significantly altered by the Y185F, Y185W, S183T, S183A, or Y185F,S183A mutations. The spectra are good evidence that the conservative changes in the altered forms of the iron-sulfur protein in which the cluster has been retained have not caused any structural rearrangement in the protein environment surrounding the iron-sulfur cluster. This is further supported by the EPR spectra of the purifiedbc1 complexes containing these altered forms of the Rieske protein, which showed small variations of all three principal g values (gz,gy : <0.01; gx : <0.04) but retained the characteristic features of “Rieske” clusters as well as their intensity (results not shown). These spectra indicate small perturbations of the electronic distribution within the cluster, as would be expected if the hydroge"

MutS- and MutL-dependent activation of DNA helicase II has also been demonstrated with a model substrate in which a 138-residue oligonucleotide was hybridized to a 138-nucleotide gap in an otherwise duplex 7,100-base pair circular DNA. Displacement of the oligonucleotide requires MutS, MutL, DNA helicase II, and ATP and is dependent on the presence of a mismatch within the hybrid region. Although DNA helicase II and Rep helicase share substantial sequence homology and features of mechanism, Rep helicase is inactive in this reaction.

Although DNA helicase II and Rep helicase share substantial sequence homology and features of mechanism, Rep helicase is inactive in this reaction. Escherichia coli methyl-directed mismatch repair initiates via the mismatch-provoked incision of the unmethylated strand at a hemimethylated d(GATC) sequence in a reaction that involves the MutS- and MutL-dependent activation of the MutH d(GATC) endonuclease activity (1Au K.G. Welsh K. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12142-12148Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The single-strand break thus produced may occur either 3′ or 5′ to the mismatch on the unmethylated strand and directs the exonucleolytic excision of that portion of the unmodified strand spanning the incised d(GATC) sequence and the mispair (2Lahue R.S. Au K.G. Modrich P. Science. 1989; 245: 160-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar, 3Grilley M. Griffith J. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11830-11837Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Excision requires MutS, MutL, DNA helicase II, and an appropriate exonuclease. When the strand break that directs repair occurs 5′ to the mismatch, excision requires RecJ exonuclease or exonuclease VII (3Grilley M. Griffith J. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11830-11837Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Cooper D.L. Lahue R.S. Modrich P. J. Biol.

For repair directed by a strand break 3′ to the mismatch, the 3′ → 5′ hydrolytic activity of exonuclease I (7Lehman I.R. Nussbaum A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 2628-2636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) is sufficient to meet the exonuclease requirement (2Lahue R.S. Au K.G. Modrich P. Science. 1989; 245: 160-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). 1E. coli extracts deficient in functional exonuclease I contain a second unidentified activity that supports mismatch repair directed by a 3′ strand signal (4Cooper D.L.

Lahue R.S. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11823-11829Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since helicase II is required for excision from either side of the mismatch and because each of these exonucleases is specific for single-stranded DNA (5Chase J.W. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 4553-4561Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Lovett S.T. Kolodner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1964; 239: 2628-2636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the action of helicase II presumably serves to unwind the incised strand so as to render it exonuclease sensitive. According to this interpretation, the exonuclease functions in excision are secondary to those of DNA helicase II. We have therefore sought partial reactions in which MutS, MutL, and a mismatch might enhance the activity of helicase II. We show here that MutL stimulates helicase II activity on a conventional substrate and that helicase activity on incised duplex DNA is enhanced by MutS and MutL in a mismatch-dependent manner. The accompanying paper (8Dao V. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9202-9207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) demonstrates that MutS, MutL, and mismatch-dependent entry of helicase II into an incised heteroduplex occurs at the strand break with helicase entry biased so that translocation occurs toward the mispair.

Proteins were diluted as necessary into 20 mm KPO4 (pH 7.4), 50 mmKCl, 1 mm DTT, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and added in 0.1 reaction volume. After incubation at 37 °C as indicated, reactions were terminated by addition of one-third volume 50 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 0.5% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 0.02% bromphenol blue, 0.02% isocyanol blue, 2 μg/ml proteinase K, 40% by volume glycerol. After incubation at 50 °C for 5 min, samples were loaded onto an 8% polyacrylamide gel containing 44.5 mm Tris, 44.5 mm boric acid (final pH 8.4), 25% by volume glycerol, and 1 mm EDTA and subjected to electrophoresis at 8 V/cm for 4 h. Radioactivity was quantitated by using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager. Wild type M13mp2 RF DNA (500 μg) was cleaved with FspI and EcoRI. Reactions were deproteinized as described above and the 7059- and 138-bp products separated by filtration through a 30-ml Sephacryl 400 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, 25-cm × 0.785-cm2) equilibrated with TNE. A gapped circle was prepared by mixing a 10-fold molar excess of the wild-type M13mp2 viral strands with 100 μg purified 7059-bp fragment, followed by alkaline denaturation, neutralization, and annealing (17Lu A.-L. Clark S. Modrich P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 4639-4643Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). The gapped product was separated from excess viral strands by hydroxylapatite chromatography (17Lu A.-L. Clark S. Modrich P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 4639-4643Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), dialyzed against 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 1 mm EDTA, concentrated 10-fold by butanol extraction, and filtered through Sephadex G-50 (7-cm × 0.19-cm2) as described above. A 138-residue single-strand oligomer was prepared for hybridization to the gapped circular duplex by PCR amplification of a segment of M13mp2 wild type RF DNA or C103 M13mp2 RF DNA using 5′-P-d(CACTGGCCGTCGTTTTACAACGTC) and 5′–OH–d(GCAACTGTTGGGAAGGGCGATCGG) as primers. Reactions (0.1 ml) contained 375-ng template DNA (wild-type or C103 M13mp2 RF DNA depending on whether no mismatch or a G-T mismatch was to be generated in the final substrate), 100 pmol of each primer, and 4 units of Vent DNA polymerase, which was used according to the recommendations of the manufacturer. Amplification used a Perkin Elmer Gene Amp 9600 with an initial incubation at 94 °C for 2 min, followed by 12 cycles of 30 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 70 °C, and 30 s at 72 °C. Protein was extracted as described above and excess primers, dNTPs, and templates were removed by filtration through Sephacryl-400 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, 25-cm × 0.785-cm2) equilibrated with TNE. Pooled fractions containing the 138-bp PCR product were concentrated by ethanol precipitation, and the washed pellet was dissolved in 200 μl of 67 mm glycine-NaOH (pH 9.4), 2.5 mm MgCl2, 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin. The 5′-phosphorylated viral strand component of the PCR product was hydrolyzed by digestion with 5 units of λ exonuclease at 37 °C for 30 min (18Prolla T.A. Pang Q. Alani E. Kolodner R.D. Liskay R.M. Science. 1994; 265: 1091-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar), and protein was extracted as described above. Undigested DNA was collected by ethanol precipitation, and 5′-end-labeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase. After deproteinization and ethanol precipitation, unincorporated label was removed by Sephadex G-50 filtration. The end-labeled 138-nucleotide complementary strand PCR product (10 pmol, corresponding to M13mp2 nucleotides 6236–6373) was hybridized to the gapped circular DNA (1 pmol) in 250 μl of 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.6, 10 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT. Incubation was at 95 °C for 5 min, 65 °C for 15 min, and the solution was then cooled to room temperature. In an alternate procedure, a 3-ml reaction containing 10 mm KPO4, pH 7.4, 10 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 2.1 nmol of the 138-nucleotide strand, and 210 pmol of gapped circular duplex was supplemented with 90 μl of 10n NaOH and incubated at room temperature for 5 min. After addition of 300 μl of 2.9 n acetic acid, 135 μl of 3m KCl, and 372 μl of 1 m KPO4, pH 7.4 (final pH 6.9), DNA was annealed at 65 °C for 30 min, slow cooled to 37 °C, and chilled on ice. Hybridized products were purified by heating to 70 °C for 5 min and filtration through Sephacryl-400 columns equilibrated with TNE at 70 °C. Quantitation was by ethidium fluorescence using M13mp2 RF DNA as a standard. Helicase activity on the duplex substrate was initiated by addition of repair proteins in a total volume of 3 μl of the diluent described above to 7 μl of a solution containing 71 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 8.0, 29 mm KCl, 8.6 mm MgCl2, 1.4 mm DTT, 71 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 2.9 mm ATP, and 23 fmol of duplex substrate. Unless specified otherwise, proteins were added in the following order and amounts: 370 fmol of MutS, 250 fmol of MutL, 120 fmol of DNA helicase II. After incubation at 30 °C as indicated, reactions were terminated as described above and supplemented with 2 μg/ml proteinase K. After a further 10 min of incubation at 30 °C, samples were loaded on a 3% Meta-Phor-agarose (FMC Corp.) in 44.5 mm Tris, 44.5 mm boric acid, pH 7.6, 1 mm EDTA and run at 4.5 V/cm for 3.5 h. The agarose gel was dried, and radioactivity was quantitated using a PhosphorImager. During initial attempts to identify a partial reaction dependent on MutS, MutL, and DNA helicase II, we found that near homogeneous preparations of MutL markedly stimulated helicase activity on a conventional substrate constructed by hybridization of a 35-residue oligonucleotide to M13mp2 viral strand DNA (see “Experimental Procedures”). Under conditions where helicase II was present at one monomer equivalent per mol of substrate (as molecules), the addition of two monomer equivalents of MutL enhanced the initial rate of oligonucleotide displacement 11-fold (Fig. 1, upper panel). MutS and/or the presence of a G-T mismatch within the hybrid region had no effect on the rate of oligonucleotide displacement in the presence or absence of MutL (not shown). E. coli Rep helicase and DNA helicase II are about 40% homologous at the sequence level (19Gilchrist C.A. Denhardt D.T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 465-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), the two proteins can form heterodimers (20Wong I. Amaratunga M. Lohman T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20386-20391Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the duplex unwinding activity of both is stimulated by a 3′-single-stranded DNA tail. Low levels of MutL also stimulated Rep unwinding about 5-fold, although higher concentrations of the Rep activity were required to support significant unwinding with the substrate used here (Fig. 1, lower panel). The failure to observe MutS or mismatch effects with the conventional helicase substrate might be due to the presence of mismatches within the secondary structure assumed by the 7 kilobases of single-stranded DNA in the molecule. To circumvent this potential problem, we constructed a duplex helicase substrate similar to that described by Washburn and Kushner (21Washburn B.K. Kushner S.R. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 341-350Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) by hybridizing a 138-residue oligonucleotide to M13mp2 circular duplex DNA that contained a 138-nucleotide gap (Fig. 2). The 138-residue oligonucleotide was produced by PCR amplification using two different templates so that duplex helicase substrates could be constructed with or without a G-T mismatch between the two strand breaks (see “Experimental Procedures”). As shown in Fig. 3, neither MutS nor MutL detectably altered the integrity of either homoduplex or G-T heteroduplex DNAs prepared in this manner. Furthermore, both DNAs supported only trace levels of unwinding by helicase II in the presence or absence of MutL or MutS. However, extensive displacement of the 138-residue oligonucleotide of the G-T heteroduplex occurred when all three proteins were present. The MutS, MutL, and helicase II-dependent unwinding reaction required ATP and Mg2+ and was not further enhanced by the addition of single-stranded DNA binding protein (not shown). It is noteworthy that the DNA and protein concentrations used in this experiment are those that have been determined to be optimal for the reconstituted mismatch repair reaction (2Lahue R.S. Au K.G. Modrich P. Science. 1989; 245: 160-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). Significant unwinding of the homoduplex control also occurred in the presence of MutS, MutL, and helicase II, but the degree of oligonucleotide displacement was considerably less than that observed with the G-T heteroduplex (Fig. 3). The kinetics of oligonucleotide displacement with these two substrates is illustrated in Fig. 4.Figure 4A time course for the MutSLU helicase assay. Assay of unwinding with duplex helicase substrates were performed as described under “Experimental Procedures” except that reactions (120 μl) contained 56 fmol of duplex G-T or A·T DNA, and MutS (2 pmol), MutL (680 fmol), and DNA helicase II (290 fmol) were present as indicated. Reactions were sampled (10 μl) as a function of time and scored for oligonucleotide displacement.

Given the random nature of production of such lesions, this hypothesis predicts that significant differences in mismatch dependence would be observed between independent sets of heteroduplex/homoduplex constructs. As summarized in TableI, this was in fact the case. With seven independent sets of heteroduplex/homoduplex constructs, the rate of unwinding of the G-T substrate ranged from 2.4 to 8.3 times that observed with the A·T control with a mean value of 4.4. Nevertheless, other explanations for the homoduplex background cannot be excluded. For example, it is possible that the MutS and MutL pair might simply activate helicase II with duplex substrates. However, as shown in the accompanying paper, we have failed to observe detectable MutS, MutL, and helicase II-dependent unwinding of a similar circular homoduplex that contained a single nick and was prepared without using PCR methodology (8Dao V. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9202-9207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar).Table IMismatch dependence of MutL, MutS, and helicase II-mediated oligonucleotide displacement from the duplex substrateHeteroduplex/Homoduplex preparationMismatch dependence12.423.333.743.953.965.078.3Mean ± S.D.4.4 ± 1.8 Open table in a new tab In contrast to mutU (uvrD) mutations that inactivate helicase II function in mismatch repair (17Lu A.-L.

Genet. 1975; 139: 233-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), rep mutants are not mutators (27Matson S.W. Kaiser-Rogers K.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 289-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar), and despite the significant MutL stimulation of Rep in conventional helicase assays (Fig. 1), the protein has no known function in mismatch repair. As shown in Fig. 5, activation of unwinding of the nicked duplex G-T substrate by MutS and MutL is specific for helicase II. Rep activity with this DNA was limited, and the presence of MutS and MutL had no significant effect on unwinding even at Rep concentrations 50 times that of the highest helicase II level tested. Previous work has demonstrated that in addition to their roles in the initiation stage of methyl-directed repair, MutS and MutL are required for one or more subsequent steps (2Lahue R.S. Au K.G. Modrich P. Science. 1989; 245: 160-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar), including the excision stage of the reaction (3Grilley M. Griffith J. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11830-11837Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The experiments described here provide further support for involvement of these two proteins in the excision stage of the reaction. Results obtained with duplex substrates of the type shown in Fig. 2 indicate that the two proteins activate unwinding by helicase II in a mismatch-dependent manner. We have not directly addressed the mechanism of this effect, but it is possible that activation may involve several steps in the unwinding reaction. The accompanying paper (8Dao V. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9202-9207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) demonstrates that mismatch-dependent unwinding by MutS- and MutL-activated helicase II initiates at a strand break. Whereas helicase II is capable of unwinding from a nick (28Runyon G.T. Bear D.G. Lohman T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6383-6387Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), this reaction requires very high helicase II concentrations with initiation being rate-limiting (29Runyon G.T. Lohman T.M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4128-4138Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the finding that a genetically altered form of helicase II is selectively defective in unwinding from a nick suggests that this reaction may be biologically significant (30Brosh Jr., R.M. Matson S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 572-579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In view of these findings, our observations with the duplex helicase substrate indicate that MutS and MutL act in mis-match-dependent manner to enhance the rate of helicase II initiation at a strand break. As noted above, this effect is specific for helicase II and does not occur with 40% homologous Rep helicase, consistent with known requirements for helicase II in mismatch repair (17Lu A.-L. Clark S. Modrich P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 4639-4643Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 26Nevers P. Spatz H. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1975; 139: 233-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In contrast to our failure to observe significant unwinding of a 138-residue oligonucleotide in the duplex substrate at low helicase II concentrations (Figs. Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4), a 12-residue oligonucleotide in this type of molecule was previously shown to be efficiently displaced at low concentrations of the protein (21Washburn B.K. Kushner S.R. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 341-350Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We think it likely that these disparate results are due to the smaller size of the oligonucleotide in the latter substrate. Since helicase II binds at nicks (29Runyon G.T. Lohman T.M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4128-4138Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), it is possible that proximity of the two strand breaks in the latter DNA results in a concerted effect on initiation of unwinding by the enzyme. Differences due to chain length effects may also reflect the relatively modest processive behavior of helicase II (31Ali J.A. Lohman T.M. Science. 1997; 275: 377-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar), and it has been shown that the number of base pairs unwound by the activity depends on the amount of the protein (32Matson S.W. George J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 2066-2076Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to the MutS- and MutL-dependent activation of helicase II at a strand break, we have also found that MutL markedly enhances the activity of helicase II, and to a lesser extent the Rep enzyme, on conventional substrates. This effect is evident at very low protein concentrations (in the case of helicase II, about one monomer equivalent and 2 MutL monomer equivalents per 7-kb DNA molecule), indicating high specificity. In fact, preliminary experiments indicate that MutL and helicase II interact in the absence of DNA as judged by native electrophoretic analysis (33Yamaguchi, M., MutS, MutL, and DNA Helicase II Are Required for Mismatch-provoked Unwinding at a Stroud ScissionPh.D. thesis, 1997, Duke University.Google Scholar). Thus, in addition to its role with MutS in activating helicase II initiation at a nick, it is likely that MutL also functions as a helicase activator subsequent to initiation of unwinding. This activation could occur by increasing the processive behavior of the helicase by a direct interaction as is the case for φX174 gene-A protein and Rep helicase (34Arai K.-I. Arai N. Shlomai J. Kobori J. Polder L. Low R. Hübscher U. Bertsch L. Kornberg A. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1981; 26: 9-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The differential effects observed with the Rep helicase in the two assays are also consistent with the idea that MutS and/or MutL modulate helicase action at several levels of the unwinding reaction. MutL stimulation of both Rep and helicase II in conventional assays can be understood in terms of the 40% sequence homology shared by the two helicases (19Gilchrist C.A. Denhardt D.T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 465-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). However, the failure of MutS and MutL to activate Rep unwinding at a single-strand break must be due to amino acid sequence elements that distinguish Rep from helicase II. Although MutL is required for several steps in methyl-directed mismatch repair, precise molecular roles for the protein in the reaction have not been assigned. MutL binds to MutS-heteroduplex complexes (12Grilley M. Welsh K.M. Su S.-S. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 1000-1004Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), is required along with MutS and a mismatch for activation of the latent d(GATC) endonuclease of MutH (1Au K.G. Welsh K. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12142-12148Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and stimulates the ATP-dependent MutS-catalyzed formation of heteroduplex DNA loops (35Allen D.J. Makhov A. Grilley M. Taylor J. Thresher R. Modrich P. Griffith J.D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4467-4476Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Such observations have led to the suggestion that MutL serves to interface mismatch recognition by MutS to other components of the repair system (36Modrich P. Ann. Rev. Genet. 1991; 25: 229-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (770) Google Scholar, 37Sancar A. Hearst J.E. Science. 1993; 259: 1415-1420Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The observations that MutL physically interacts with and activates helicase II are consistent with this view (33Yamaguchi, M., MutS, MutL, and DNA Helicase II Are Required for Mismatch-provoked Unwinding at a Stroud ScissionPh.D. thesis, 1997, Duke University.Google Scholar). Coupled with the finding that MutL is also required for the mismatch, MutS, and helicase II-dependent unwinding observed with nicked circular heteroduplex substrate, we think it likely that the protein has an important role in the mismatch-dependent loading of helicase II into the nicked heteroduplex, an event that is shown in the accompanying paper (8Dao V. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9202-9207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) to occur at the strand break. A single hemimodified d(GATC) sequence is sufficient to provide strand specificity to heteroduplex repair by the E. colimethyl-directed pathway (4Cooper D.L. Lahue R.S. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11823-11829Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Lahue R.S. Su S.S. Modrich P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 1482-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), and mismatch-provoked incision of the unmethylated strand of this d(GATC) site by activated MutH (1Au K.G. Welsh K. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12142-12148Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) provides a strand break that is thought to serve as the initiation site for exonucleolytic removal of that portion of the new strand spanning the nick and the mispair (3Grilley M. Griffith J. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11830-11837Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The latter conclusion is based on the finding that excision on a single d(GATC) site heteroduplex depends not only on MutS, MutL, and DNA helicase II (2Lahue R.S. Au K.G. Modrich P. Science. 1989; 245: 160-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar, 3Grilley M. Griffith J. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11830-11837Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but also requires an appropriate 3′ → 5′ or 5′ → 3′ single-strand exonuclease, depending on whether the MutH strand break is produced 3′ or 5′ to the mispair (4Cooper D.L. Lahue R.S. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11823-11829Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). By contrast, we have shown here that MutS, MutL, and helicase II are sufficient to displace a mismatched oligonucleotide from a heteroduplex in which a strand break is present on either side of the mismatch, raising questions concerning the biological significance of this exonuclease-independent reaction. Unfortunately, it is difficult to compare results obtained with the two types of heteroduplex. In the single d(GATC) site substrates examined previously, the distance between the MutH-produced strand break and the mispair is 1,000 bp (39Su S.-S. Lahue R.S. Au K.G. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6829-6835Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas nicks in the heteroduplex described here were located 45- and 92-bp to either side of the mismatch. Since activated helicase II can clearly unwind the latter substrate, concurrent exonucleolytic hydrolysis of the displaced strand product may be necessary for continued unwinding of the 1000 base pairs that separate the mismatch and the strand break in the former heteroduplexes. The distinct properties of these two types of substrates may be clarified by study of two d(GATC) site molecules and by examination of doubly incised heteroduplexes as a function of strand break-mismatch separation distance.

A chimera consisting of the N-terminal half of MKP-3 with the C-terminal catalytic core of M3-6 also bound tightly to ERK1 but not to JNK3/SAPKβ. Consistent with a role for N-terminal binding in determining MKP-3 specificity, at least 10-fold higher concentrations of purified MKP-3ΔN than full-length MKP-3 is required to inhibit ERK2 activity. In contrast, both MKP-3ΔN and full-length MKP-3 inactivate JNK/SAPK and p38 MAP kinases at similarly high concentrations. Also, a chimera of the M3-6 N terminus with the MKP-3 catalytic core which fails to bind ERK elicits non selective inactivation of ERK1 and JNK3/SAPKβ.

Different cell stimuli appear to activate distinct MAP kinases preferentially. Hence, while growth factors and some oncogenes are linked to activation of ERK, inflammatory cytokines and cell stresses lead to activation of JNK/SAPK and p38 (1Cohen P.

Of these family members MKP-3/PYST1 and M3-6 appear exceptional insofar that they display highly specific inactivation of ERK or SAPK/JNK MAP kinases, respectively (38Groom L.A. Sneddon A.A.

One important unanswered question is of the structural domains within MKP-3 and M3-6 which underlie their selectivity for inactivation of different MAP kinases. Dual specificity phosphatase family members are characterized by an extended PTP active site signature sequence localized to the C-terminal half of the molecule (41Wiland A.M. Denu J.M. Mourey R.J.

Chem. 1994; 269: 3596-3604Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Despite low homology within CH2 domains, the N-terminal halves of dual specificity phosphatases are otherwise highly divergent (21Keyse S.M. Biochem. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1265: 152-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 36Muda M. Boschert U. Dickinson R. Martinou J.-C. Martinou I. Camps M. Schlegel W. Arkinstall S. J. Biol.

We report here experiments demonstrating that the N-terminal half of MKP-3 is responsible for tight binding to its substrates ERK1 and ERK2 but not JNK/SAPKs or p38. This interaction appears to be responsible for MKP-3 enzymatic selectivity for inactivation of ERK MAP kinases. To produce the full-length GST-MKP3 fusion protein, the oligonucleotides GCCGGATCCATGATAGATACGCTCAGACC and GCCCTCGAGTCACGTAGATT GCAGTTGCAGGGAGTC were used to PCR amplify the complete MKP3 coding sequence from pMST-SM (36Muda M.

Upon restriction digestion with BamHI and XhoI the amplified cDNA was ligated to the corresponding sites in the pGEX4T3. To generate an enzymatically inactive GST-MKP3 fusion protein, the essential catalytic Cys293 was changed to Ser by site-directed mutagenesis performed using the Transformer site-directed mutagenesis kit (CLONTECH). To produce a GST fusion protein consisting of the MKP-3 C-terminal catalytic core (GST-MKP-3ΔN; amino acids 153–381) the first 151 amino acid were deleted by cutting full length pGEX4T3/MKP-3 (see above) withXbaI and BamHI followed by religation. To generate the MKP-3 N terminus as a GST fusion protein (GST-MKP-3ΔC; amino acids 1–221), the plasmid pGEX4T3/MKP-3 was digested withStyI and XhoI and ligated to a double-stranded oligonucleotide obtained by annealing the two oligonucleotides CAAGGAACTAAGAAGGGGTTCGCT and TCGAGCGAACCCCTTCTTAGTC. Fig. 1 A illustrates schematically the MKP-3 amino acid sequences encoded within these fusion proteins. All MKP-3 and other GST-fusion proteins were expressed in E. coli by induction with 100 μm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and growth overnight at 20 °C. Fusion proteins were purified with glutathione-Sepharose using standard techniques. ERK2 and MEK-1 EE were further purified following cleavage of the GST-fusion as described (39Muda M. Boschert U.

The Myc-epitope EQKLISEEDL was constructed using the oligonucleotides GGCCCGAGCAGAAACTTATCTCCGAGGAAGATCTCTG and AATTCAGAGATCTTCCTCGGAGATAAGTTTGTCCTCG and was used together with pMT-SM vector (Asp718-EcoRI-digested) and the M3-6 fragment in a triple ligation. To make MKP-3/M3-6 chimeras the following oligonucleotides were then synthesized: M3-6(A), CCTGGGATCCCAGAAAGATGTC; M3-6(B), CTGGGATCCCAGGTAGAGGTGAG; MKP-3(A), CCTGGGATCCGCCAAGGACTCTAC; and MKP-3(B), GGCGGATCCCAGGTAAAGGAAGG together with a T3 primer and the vector primers pMT(A) TTGTTGTCAAGCTTGAGGTG and pMT(B) TCACGCTAGGATTGCCGTCA.

These polymerase chain reaction products were then digested using XhoI-BamHI orBamHI-EcoRI, respectively, and subcloned into SalI-EcoRI linearized pMT-SM by triple ligation. An epitope tagged version of the N-terminal portion MKP3, termed MKP-3ΔC, was made using an oligonucleotide encoding the Myc epitope sequence corresponding to the sequence EQKLISEEDLN ligated to theBamHI site of the construct CB16.

Full-length PYST1 has been shown previously to form stable complexes with p42-ERK2 (38Groom L.A. Sneddon A.A. Alessi D.R. Dowd S. Keyse S.M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3621-3632Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar), although binding to p44-ERK1, JNK/SAPK, or p38 MAP kinases was not investigated. To test this, we transfected COS-7 cells with p44-HA-ERK1, p42-Myc-ERK2, p54-HA-JNK3/SAPKβ, or HA-p38 and compared the ability of a range of GST-MKP-3 fusion proteins immobilized on glutathione beads to precipitate these MAP kinases from cell extracts. To perform these experiments the following fusion proteins were purified following expression in E. coli: full-length GST-MKP-3, the inactive mutant GST-MKP-3 C293S, the MKP-3 N-terminal GST-MKP-3ΔC (amino acids 1–221), and the MKP-3 C-terminal GST-MKP-3ΔN (amino acids 153–381) (Fig. 1). When incubated with lysates from transfected COS-7 cells, GST-MKP-3 is able to precipitate both p44-HA-ERK1 and p42-Myc-ERK2 (Fig. 2). In contrast, no precipitation of p54-HA-JNK3/SAPKβ or HA-p38 MAP kinases by GST-MKP-3 was detected under identical conditions (Fig. 2). In a similar manner, the inactive mutant GST-MKP-3 C293S binds tightly and precipitates both p44-HA-ERK1 and p42-Myc-ERK2 while binding only weakly to HA-p38 MAP kinase. No precipitation of p54-HA-JNK3/SAPKβ was observed under identical conditions (Fig. 2). To test whether MKP-3 binding to ERK MAP kinases reflects interaction through N- and/or C-terminal regions, we next performed precipitations using either GST-MKP-3ΔC or GST-MKP-3ΔN (Fig. 1). Unlike the full- length MKP-3 molecule, GST-MKP-3ΔN containing the C-terminal catalytic core is unable to precipitate detectable levels of either p44-HA-ERK1 or p42-Myc-ERK2 (Fig. 2). GST-MKP-3ΔN was also unable to bind detectably to either p54-HA-JNK3/SAPKβ or HA-p38 MAP kinases (Fig. 2). The inability of GST-MKP-3ΔN to bind ERK MAP kinases is unlikely to reflect misfolding as this fusion protein displayed similar enzymatic activity as full-length GST-MKP-3 when using the artificial substrate p-nitrophenyl phosphate (Fig. 3). Somewhat surprisingly, and in contrast to the C-terminal catalytic core of MKP-3, the N-terminal GST-MKP-3ΔC was found to bind tightly and precipitate both p44-HA-ERK1 and p42-Myc-ERK2 at least as well as the full length GST-MKP-3 molecule (Fig. 2). GST-MKP-3ΔC was also able to bind weakly to HA-p38 MAP kinase while this fusion was completely ineffective at binding p54-HA-JNK3/SAPKβ (Fig. 2). Overall, the rank-order for MKP-3 N-terminal binding and precipitation of MAP kinases is p44-ERK1 = p42-ERK2 ≫ p38 > p54SAPKβ. Together, these observations indicate that the N-terminal half of MKP-3 is alone able to bind tightly to ERK family MAP kinases and probably accounts, at least in part, for the precipitation observed with the full-length molecule. Studies in yeast and mammalian cells have demonstrated that elements within MAP kinase cascades as well as other signal transduction pathways form multicomponent complexes through tight association with various anchoring proteins. For instance, the yeast pheromone mating response MAP kinases FUS3 or KSS1, as well as the upstream kinases STE7 and STE11 and G protein β-subunit STE4 all bind simultaneously to the scaffold protein STE5, while the mammalian cell protein AKAP79 maintains protein kinase A and C, as well as the serine threonine protein phosphatase calcineurin in close proximity to their target substrates (46Klauck T.M.

Dev. 1997; 7: 59-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). To test whether MKP-3 is able to bind to ERK MAP kinases directly and independently of additional cellular proteins, we next tested binding to p42 ERK2 protein purified following its expression in E. coli and cleavage from its GST fusion. Fig. 4 shows that, as observed with cell lysates, GST-MKP-3, GST-MKP-3 C293S, and GST-MKP-3ΔC immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads are all able to bind and precipitate purified p42 ERK2 from lysis buffer, while GST-MKP-3 ΔN binds only very weakly to this MAP kinase. This result indicates that binding between the MKP-3 N-terminal and ERK MAP kinases is direct and independent of additional cellular proteins. To investigate the relationship between MKP-3 binding and MAP kinase inactivation we next incubated purified ERK2 activated by the constitutively active MAP kinase kinase MEK-1 mutant S218E S222E (39Muda M. Boschert U. Smith A. Antonsson B. Gillieron C. Chabert C. Camps M. Martinou I. Ashworth A. Arkinstall S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5141-5151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar,45Stokoe D. Campbell D.G. Nakielny S. Hidaka H. Leevers S.J. Marshall C.J. Cohen P. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3985-3994Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar) together with increasing concentrations of either full-length GST-MKP-3 or GST-MKP-3ΔN. While 0.5 μg of MKP-3 completely blocked MEK-1-dependent ERK2 activation, 10-fold higher concentrations of MKP-3ΔN were required to elicit similar inhibition of this MAP kinase (Fig. 5). In contrast to potent and selective inactivation of ERK2 by MKP-3, similarly high concentrations of MKP-3 and MKP-3ΔN were required to inhibit either JNK2/SAPKα or JNK3/SAPKβ activated in vitro by purified SEK1 or to reverse p38 MAP kinase activation by MKK6 (Fig. 5). This suggests that, in contrast to full-length MKP-3, MKP-3ΔN displays little selectivity for inactivating different MAP kinase isoforms. These experiments demonstrate a clear correlation between ERK binding to full-length MKP-3 and specificity for ERK MAP kinase inactivation. We next co-expressed in COS-7 cells either p44-HA-ERK1 or p54-HA-JNK3/SAPKβ together with Myc epitope-tagged versions of MKP-3, MKP-3 C293S, MKP-3ΔC (amino acids 1–217), M3-6, CB16 (chimera consisting of N-terminal 217 residues of MKP-3 and amino acids 172–321 M3-6), or CA8 (chimera of M3-6 N-terminal 171 residues with amino acids 218–381 of MKP-3) (Fig. 6). In agreement with observations using the GST fusion proteins, when cell extracts were subject to immunoprecipitation using the Myc epitope-specific monoclonal antibody 9E10, p44-HA-ERK1 can be seen clearly to bind tightly to MKP-3, MKP-3 C293S, and MKP-3ΔC, while p54-HA-JNK3/SAPKβ failed to immunoprecipitate detectably with any of these MKP-3 constructs (Fig. 7). Also consistent with our previous observations, p44-HA-ERK1 binds tightly and co-immunoprecipitates with the chimera CB16 (with the MKP-3 N terminus) despite consistently lower levels of expression with this construct (Fig. 7). In contrast, p44-HA-ERK1 failed to co-immunoprecipitate detectably with either M3-6 or the chimera CA8 comprising the M3-6 N terminus (Fig. 7). Neither M3-6, CB16, or CA8 bind detectably to p54-SAPKβ under identical conditions (Fig. 7). To confirm that tight binding between the MKP-3 N terminus and ERK also parallels specific inactivation of this class of MAP kinase within intact cells, immune complex assays were performed on p44-HA-ERK1 and p54-HA-JNK3/SAPKβ co-expressed with the same MKP-3 and M3-6 constructs. As we have reported previously (40Muda M. Theodosiou A. Rodrigues N. Boschert U. Camps M. Gillieron C. Davies K. Ashworth A. Arkinstall S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27205-27208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar) MKP-3 co-expression abolishes EGF-stimulated activation of p44-HA-ERK1 (Fig. 8). In contrast, the catalytically inactive mutants MKP-3 (C293S) and MKP-3ΔC fail to inhibit, and rather augment by 2–3-fold the activation state of p44-HA-ERK1 (Fig. 8). Also as seen before (40Muda M. Theodosiou A. Rodrigues N. Boschert U. Camps M. Gillieron C. Davies K. Ashworth A. Arkinstall S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27205-27208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar), co-expression of M3-6 is completely unable to suppress EGF-stimulated p44-HA-ERK1, while anisomycin-dependent stimulation of p54-HA-JNK3/SAPKβ is inhibited by >90% (Fig. 8). It is of note that a truncated version of this dual specificity phosphatase, M3-6ΔC (Fig. 6 A), elicits indistinguishable selective inhibition of p54-HA-JNK3/SAPKβ (not shown). Dramatically, and in contrast to tight binding of CB16 to p44-HA-ERK1 (Fig. 7), CB16 is totally ineffective in its ability to inhibit EGF-stimulated activation of this MAP kinase (Fig. 8). Rather, as observed with the enzymatically inactive mutants MKP-3 C293S and MKP-3ΔC, co-expression of CB16 facilitates p44-HA-ERK1 activation state by approximately 2-fold (Fig. 8). Importantly, CB16 appears to be an active enzyme as its co-expression with p54-HA-JNK3/SAPKβ results in an ∼80% inhibition of anisomycin-stimulated activity (Fig. 8). The chimera CB16 therefore retains the enzymatic specificity of its M3-6 catalytic core despite tight interaction with p44-HA-ERK1. In contrast to these observations, the chimera CA8 possessing the catalytic core of MKP-3 and which fails to bind to p44-HA-ERK1 (Fig. 7), mediates complete inactivation of EGF-stimulated activation of this MAP kinase (Fig. 8). Notably however, and as observed in vitro using GST-MKP-3ΔN (Fig. 5), CA8 differs from MKP-3 insofar that it displays no selectivity for inactivation of p44-HA-ERK1 when compared with p54-HA-JNK3/SAPKβ (Fig. 9). This indicates that binding of the MKP-3 N terminus to ERK isoforms within intact cells also plays a critical role in determining specificity for inactivation of this class of MAP kinase.Figure 9Inhibition of ERK1 and SAPKβ by MKP-3 and the M3-6/MKP-3 chimera CA8. COS-7 cells were transfected with 1 μg of p44-HA-ERK1 (A and C) or p54-HA-JNK3/SAPKβ (B and D) alone or together with increasing concentrations of the MKP-3 (A and B) or CA8 (C and D) plasmid as indicated. Plasmid concentrations were kept constant using the empty pMT-SM vector. After culture for 40 h, cells were incubated for 2 h in serum-free medium and then stimulated with either 10 nm EGF (p44-HA-ERK1) or 10 μg/ml anisomycin (p54-HA-JNK3/SAPKβ). Following cell lysis, MAP kinase immunoprecipitation and immunecomplex assays were performed as described in Fig. 8. Upper panels in A–D show autoradiograms of phosphorylated MBP (p44-HA-ERK1) or c-Jun (p54-HA-JNK3/SAPKβ) upon co-expression with the indicated amounts of MKP-3 (A and B) or CA8 (C and D) plasmid. Substrate bands were excised for counting by scintillation spectrometry and calculation of relative kinase activity which is indicated numerically below each lane. Western blot of immunoprecipitated (IP) p44-HA-ERK1 and p54-HA-JNK3/SAPKβ used for immune complex assays is shown below each autoradiogram. Detection is as described in Fig. 8.

Nature. 1996; 382: 555-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Based on the crystal structure of VHR, reliable secondary structure prediction of rVH6 (identical to MKP-3) is possible and demonstrates that the C-terminal domain (amino acids 134–381) is alone able to form the catalytic core of this dual specificity phosphatase (41Wiland A.M. Denu J.M. Mourey R.J. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33486-33492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). We have obtained essentially identical results modeling the primary amino acids 209–348 of MKP-3 on the crystal structure of VHR using the SWISS MODEL program (53Peitsch M.C. Bio/Technology. 1995; 13: 658-660Crossref Scopus (116) Google Scholar) (not shown). These secondary structure predictions are also consistent with experimental observations that the MKP-3 C-terminal half displays indistinguishable enzymatic activity to the full-length molecule when using the artificial substrate p-nitrophenyl phosphate (Fig. 3). What then is the function of the N-terminal noncatalytic halves of this gene family? Experiments described in this report demonstrate that one role for the N terminus of MKP-3 is likely to be tight binding to its substrate MAP kinases p44-ERK1 and p42-ERK2. Tight substrate binding may ensure highly restricted enzyme action within the environment of an intact cell. One untested hypothesis is that the highly divergent N termini of dual specificity phosphatase family members (39Muda M. Boschert U. Smith A. Antonsson B. Gillieron C. Chabert C. Camps M. Martinou I. Ashworth A. Arkinstall S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5141-5151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) bind tightly to a distinct set of target substrates. Interestingly, examination of the gene structures of CL100 and PAC1 indicates that their N termini are encoded by exons 1 and 2 and may have distinct evolutionary origins to the C-terminal catalytic core (44Kwak S.P. Hakes D.J. Martell K.J. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3596-3604Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 54Noguchi T. Metz R. Chen L. Mattei M.-G. Carrasco D. Bravo R. Mol. Cell.

Diverse substrate binding capabilities for this gene family may therefore have arisen through convergence of gene structures encoding a limited set of catalytic cores with a more varied range of N-teminal targeting sequences. The emergence of gene structures for other dual specificity phosphatase family members will help clarify this issue. In summary, these observations demonstrate that MKP-3 binds directly the MAP kinases ERK1 and ERK2 through its non-catalytic N terminus. MKP-3 binding displays the rank order p44-ERK1 = p42-ERK2 ≫ p38 > p54SAPKβ which parallels its enzymatic specificity for MAP kinase inactivation (38Groom L.A. Sneddon A.A. Alessi D.R. Dowd S.

Experiments described in this report using the MKP-3ΔN catalytic core as well as with chimeras of MKP-3 and M3-6 indicate that this binding may underlie MKP-3 selectivity for ERK family MAP kinases. Restricted substrate binding by the structurally diverse N termini of different dual-specificity phosphatases may provide a general mechanism ensuring enzymatic selectivity for this gene family.

(1998) J. Biol. Chem., 273, 9197–9201). We have studied unwinding of 6.4-kilobase circular G-T heteroduplexes that contain a single-strand incision, 808 base pairs 5′ to the mismatch or 1023 base pairs 3′ to the mispair as viewed along the shorter path between the two DNA sites. Unwinding of both substrates in the presence of MutS, MutL, DNA helicase II, and single-stranded DNA binding protein was mismatch-dependent and initiated at the single-strand break. Although unwinding occurred in both directions from the strand break, it was biased toward the shorter path linking the strand break and the mispair. MutS and MutL are thus sufficient to coordinate mismatch recognition to the orientation-dependent activation of helicase II unwinding at a single-strand break located a kilobase from the mispair. Escherichia coli MutS, MutL, and DNA helicase II are sufficient to initiate mismatch-dependent unwinding of an incised heteroduplex (Yamaguchi, M., Dao, V., and Modrich, P. (1998) J. Biol.

MutS and MutL are thus sufficient to coordinate mismatch recognition to the orientation-dependent activation of helicase II unwinding at a single-strand break located a kilobase from the mispair. The strand specificity necessary for correction of DNA biosynthetic errors by the Escherichia coli mismatch repair system is provided by the transient absence of adenine modification of d(GATC) sequences within newly synthesized DNA (1Meselson M. Low K.B. Recombination of the Genetic Material. Academic Press, San Diego1988: 91-113Google Scholar). Repair is initiated by binding of a MutS homodimer to a mismatch followed by addition of MutL to this complex (2Su S.-S. Lahue R.S. Au K.G. Modrich P. J. Biol.

Assembly of this ternary complex activates a MutH-associated endonuclease that cleaves the unmethylated strand at a hemimethylated d(GATC) sequence within newly replicated DNA (5Au K.G. Welsh K.

The single-strand break introduced by MutH, which may occur either 3′ or 5′ to the mismatch on the unmethylated strand, directs the excision of that portion of the unmodified strand spanning the d(GATC) sequence and the mispair (6Lahue R.S.

Excision requires MutS, MutL, DNA helicase II (also called MutU), and depending on the strand break to mismatch orientation, a 3′ → 5′ or 5′ → 3′ single-strand exonuclease (6Lahue R.S. Au K.G.

In this paper we have used KMnO4 to determine the site of initiation of mismatch-dependent helix unwinding in DNA substrates containing a site- and strand-specific, single-strand break. Permanganate preferentially attacks single-stranded DNA where it oxidizes the 5,6 double bond of thymine and methylcytosine and reacts to a lesser degree with other bases (10Hayatsu H. Ukita T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1967; 29: 556-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 11Fritzsche E. Hayatsu H. Igloi G.L. Iida S. Kössel H.

This single-strand selective reagent has been used previously to detect helix opening associated with promoter melting by bacterial and eukaryotic RNA polymerases (12Sasse-Dwight S. Gralla J.D. Proc.

Using this approach we show that MutS-, MutL-, and helicase II-dependent unwinding of an incised heteroduplex initiates at the strand break, with the direction of unwinding being biased toward the shorter path between the strand break and the mismatch in a circular heteroduplex.

DNAs with a single-strand break in the complementary strand at the HincII site are referred to as 5′-heteroduplexes since the nick is 5′ to the mismatch as viewed along the shorter path (808 base pairs) in the circular DNA. A second configuration, referred to as a 3′-substrate, was prepared by MutH incision of the viral strand at the single GATC site (1023 bp from the mismatch, shorter path) in hemimethylated DNA (6Lahue R.S.

The excision step of methyl-directed mismatch repair requires MutS, MutL, DNA helicase II, an appropriate exonuclease, and a heteroduplex containing a single-strand break (6Lahue R.S. Au K.G. Modrich P. Science. 1989; 245: 160-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar, 7Grilley M. Griffith J. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11830-11837Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Cooper D.L. Lahue R.S. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11823-11829Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The accompanying article demonstrates that MutL greatly stimulates helicase II on conventional helicase substrates and that MutS and MutL activate the unwinding activity of helicase II on an incised DNA containing a mismatch (9Yamaguchi M. Dao V. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 273: 9197-9201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (134) Google Scholar). We show here that MutS-, MutL-, and helicase II-dependent unwinding of heteroduplex DNA initiates at the strand break. To determine the site of initiation of heteroduplex unwinding, we have used permanganate, which preferentially oxidizes thymidylate residues in single-stranded DNA (10Hayatsu H. Ukita T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1967; 29: 556-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 11Fritzsche E. Hayatsu H. Igloi G.L. Iida S. Kössel H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 5517-5528Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Since thymidylate oxidation renders the phosphodiester bond subject to hydrolysis by strong base, the location of oxidized residues can be determined. The circular 6.4-kilobase DNAs used in this work contained a G-T mismatch (or an G·C base pair) and a site- and strand-specific nick located 808 bp 5′ or 1023 bp 3′ to the mismatch as viewed along the short path linking the two DNA sites in the circular molecules (Fig. 1). For convenience, the two substrate orientations are referred to as 5′- or 3′-heteroduplexes, respectively. A solution of G-T heteroduplex (or G·C homoduplex), MutL, MutS, and helicase II was mixed in a chemical quench device with a solution of ATP and SSB, and after brief incubation reactions were subjected to a 2 s oxidation with KMnO4 (see “Experimental Procedures”). Sites of KMnO4 hydrolysis were mapped relative to an appropriate restriction site by indirect end-labeling (18Fang W.-H. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11838-11844Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) after piperidine hydrolysis and electrophoresis through denaturing polyacrylamide gels. As shown in Fig. 2(lanes 1–3), initiation of unwinding of the 5′-G-T heteroduplex at the single-strand break was evident as judged by conversion of either the incised (upper panel) or the continuous (lower panel) strand of the molecule to a permanganate-sensitive form. Conversion of that region of the molecule to permanganate-sensitivity in the vicinity of the nick was rapid with a maximal unwinding rate achieved in 5 s or less. An otherwise identical G·C homoduplex did not support the reaction (lane 8), and increased permanganate reactivity was not observed in the absence of helicase II or MutS (lanes 4 and 5) or in the absence of MutL (not shown). Consequently, unwinding observed at the strand break is dependent on MutS, MutL, and helicase II and on the recognition of a mismatch 808-bp distant. Analysis of permanganate sensitivity of the continuous strand of the heteroduplex (Fig. 2,lower panel) revealed that mismatch-provoked unwinding of 5′-heteroduplex occurred to either side of the nick. This observation will be considered further below. As shown in Fig. 3, virtually identical results were obtained with a 3′-G-T heteroduplex in which the mismatch and strand break were separated by 1023 bp. However, in contrast to results obtained with the 5′-heteroduplex described above, the degree of unwinding of the 3′-substrate increased significantly between 1 and 5 s, perhaps due to the increased distance between the two DNA sites in the latter molecule. Although presence of a G-T mismatch is known to enhance helix dynamics in the vicinity of the mispair (19Patel D.J. Pardi A. Itakura K. Science. 1982; 216: 581-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 20Pardi A. Morden K.M. Patel D.J. Tinoco Jr., I. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 6567-6574Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), the mismatched thymidylate in the G-T heteroduplex did not detectably react with permanganate under the mild oxidation conditions used. 2The mismatched thymidylate residue does react with permanganate under more vigorous conditions (6 mmKMnO4 for 3 min at 37 °C, L. Blackwell and P. Modrich, unpublished observations). Furthermore, under conditions where single-strand character was rapidly generated at the strand break in the G-T heteroduplex in the presence of MutS, MutL, helicase II, and SSB, permanganate oxidation products were not detected in the vicinity of the mismatch after 5 s incubation. This is illustrated in Fig. 4 for the 5′-G-T heteroduplex, and identical results were obtained with the 3′-substrate (not shown). These results imply that the single-strand character that develops at the strand break in an incised heteroduplex is not the consequence of an unwinding event that initiates at the mispair and propagates to the mismatch. Consequently, we have concluded that unwinding by activated helicase II initiates at the strand break. The extent of unwinding observed with 5′- and 3′-heteroduplexes was about 50–100 nucleotides. As mentioned above and shown in the lower panels of Figs. 2 and3, analysis of permanganate sensitivity of the continuous heteroduplex strand demonstrated that unwinding occurs in both directions from the strand break. However, analysis of mismatch-provoked methyl-directed excision tracts produced in extracts and in a purified system has demonstrated that excision is largely restricted to the shorter path between the strand signal and the mismatch in circular heteroduplexes similar to those used here (7Grilley M. Griffith J. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11830-11837Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The unwinding reactions described above utilized only a subset of the proteins required for methyl-directed mismatch repair, and helicase II is known to load preferentially onto single-strand regions within otherwise duplex DNA (21Runyon G.T. Lohman T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17502-17512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Consequently, it was possible that a directional unwinding preference was masked to some degree by secondary events in which the helicase loaded onto single-stranded DNA produced by orientation-dependent unwinding from the strand break. This possibility was assessed in several ways with potential unwinding preference estimated by summing integrated band intensities of oxidation products produced on the continuous heteroduplex strand to either side of the nick. As shown in Figs. 5 and6 (upper panels), directional unwinding from the strand break toward the mismatch via the shorter path in the circular heteroduplex could be demonstrated with both 3′- and 5′-heteroduplexes, but the magnitude of preference for the shorter path decreased monotonically with increasing helicase II concentration. A decrease in preferential unwinding along the shorter path with both substrates also occurred as reaction time increased (Figs. 5 and 6,lower panels), and whereas heteroduplex unwinding from the strand break did not require SSB, presence of the protein conferred a modest increase in directional unwinding (not shown). MutS and MutL are therefore not only sufficient to activate helicase II unwinding from the strand break of an incised heteroduplex, but they also confer directionality on this process.Figure 6Helicase II unwinding is biased toward the shorter path between the nick and mismatch with a 5′-heteroduplex.Complete reactions, which contained a 5′-G-T heteroduplex with a nick in the C strand at the HincII site (Fig. 1), were performed as described under “Experimental Procedures” and in the legend to Fig. 5. SSB was present at 8 μg.

A. 1987; 84: 1482-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), with mismatch-provoked incision of the unmethylated strand of the d(GATC) site providing a strand break that directs removal of that portion of the new strand spanning the nick and the mispair (5Au K.G. Welsh K. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12142-12148Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Lahue R.S. Au K.G. Modrich P.

Analysis of reaction intermediates has suggested that excision initiates at the strand break by a mechanism in which helicase II displacement renders the incised strand sensitive to an appropriate 3′ → 5′ or 5′ → 3′ single-strand exonuclease, depending on location of the nick 3′ or 5′ to the mispair (7Grilley M. Griffith J. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11830-11837Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The experiments described here are compatible with this mechanism and demonstrate that MutS and MutL are sufficient to coordinate mismatch recognition to activation of helicase II unwinding at a single-strand break that can be located 800–1,000 bp from the mismatch. As noted previously (7Grilley M. Griffith J. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11830-11837Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Cooper D.L. Lahue R.S. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11823-11829Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the bidirectional nature of the methyl-directed system requires loading of the appropriate hydrolytic activity at the incised d(GATC) sequence to ensure that excision proceeds toward the mispair. The finding that helicase II activation by MutS and MutL results in a significant degree of orientation-dependent unwinding on a nicked heteroduplex suggests that the latter proteins are sufficient to evaluate placement of the strand break 3′ or 5′ to the mismatch. Despite their separation distance, interaction of the mismatch and the strand break during the course of this reaction is fast with maximal initiation of unwinding achieved after 1–5 s under conditions of MutS, MutL, and helicase II excess. Although the molecular events responsible for interaction of the two DNA sites are not fully understood, recent electron microscopy experiments (4Allen D.J. Makhov A. Grilley M. Taylor J. Thresher R. Modrich P. Griffith J.D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4467-4476Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar) have suggested that MutS translocation along the heteroduplex contour may play a role in this process. Whereas the MutS dimer initially binds to heteroduplex DNA at the mismatch, this complex is converted in the presence of ATP to an α-shaped DNA structure that is stabilized by MutS at the base. The mismatch in such complexes is usually found in the DNA loop. This rearrangement has been attributed to a mechanism in which the two subunits of the MutS dimer act as ATP-driven divergent motors that translocate from the mispair in a bidirectional fashion along the helix contour. MutL stimulates this reaction and when present migrates along the helix with MutS. Under the buffer conditions used for the experiments described here, the rate of MutS-catalyzed formation of α-shaped DNA loops approaches 10,000 bp per min in the absence of MutL (4Allen D.J. Makhov A. Grilley M. Taylor J. Thresher R. Modrich P. Griffith J.D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4467-4476Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar), sufficiently fast to account for the interaction of the two sites observed in the experiments described here. Fig. 7 illustrates a mechanism for MutS- and MutL-dependent activation of helicase II unwinding that incorporates these electron microscopy results, as well as the findings presented here and in the accompanying paper (9Yamaguchi M. Dao V. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 273: 9197-9201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Helicase II activation initiates by binding of a MutS dimer to the mismatch (4Allen D.J. Makhov A. Grilley M. Taylor J. Thresher R. Modrich P. Griffith J.D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4467-4476Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). MutL adds to the MutS·DNA complex in a reaction that requires ATP but apparently not ATP hydrolysis (3Grilley M. Welsh K.M. Su S.-S. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 1000-1004Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although MutL exists as a dimer in solution (3Grilley M. Welsh K.M. Su S.-S. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 1000-1004Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the stoichiometry of MutL addition has not been established. In a reaction that depends on ATP hydrolysis, the subunits of the MutS dimer leave the mismatch, usually in a bidirectional manner, with MutL moving along the helix with MutS. At a stage in the reaction that remains to be determined, helicase II adds to MutS·MutL·DNA complex, and when a strand break is encountered the activity enters the helix in such a way that unwinding tends to proceed toward the mismatch, irrespective of placement of the nick 3′ or 5′ to the mispair on the incised strand. Since MutL greatly stimulates the activity of helicase II and since the two proteins interact physically (9Yamaguchi M. Dao V. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 273: 9197-9201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 23Yamaguchi, M. (1997) MutS, MutL, and DNA Helicase II Are Required for Mismatch-provoked Unwinding at a Stroud Scission, Ph.D. thesis, Duke University.Google Scholar), it is likely that MutL directly promotes initiation of unwinding by helicase, perhaps by physically facilitating helix entry of the activity at the strand break. DNA helicases show a preferred polarity during initiation of unwinding (24Lohman T.M. Bjornson K.P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 169-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar). The orientation-dependent unwinding from the nick toward the mismatch described here can be understood in terms of this polarity preference, which for helicase II is 3′ to 5′ (25Matson S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 10169-10175Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, one need only invoke loading of the unwinding activity onto the incised strand when the nick is 3′ to the mismatch or onto the continuous strand when nick is 5′ to the mispair. The suggestion that MutL may have an important role in activating the excision step of bacterial mismatch repair may have implications for the eukaryotic reaction. The mammalian pathway has a mispair specificity similar to that of the bacterial reaction and occurs by a similar bidirectional mechanism. Defects in this system have been implicated in both inherited and sporadic cancers, as well as in cellular resistance to certain DNA damaging agents (26Eshleman J.R. Markowitz S.D. Curr. Opin. Oncol. 1995; 7: 83-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 27Kolodner R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1433-1442Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar, 28Modrich P. Lahue R. Annu. Rev.

However, in contrast to the MutS and MutL homodimers that are active in the bacterial pathway, human mismatch repair is dependent on MutSα, a heterodimer of the MutS homologs MSH2 and MSH6, and MutLα, a heterodimer of the MutL homologs MLH1 and PMS2 (30Li G.M.

Science. 1995; 268: 1912-1914Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). CertainMLH1 and PMS2 mutations confer selective directional defects in mismatch repair. Thus, some MLH1mutations are selectively defective in repair directed by a strand break located 3′ to the mismatch but are proficient in mismatch correction directed by a 5′-strand signal (33Drummond J.T. Anthoney A. Brown R. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19645-19648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). 3G.-M. Li and P. Modrich, unpublished observations. Conversely, aPMS2 mutation has been identified that blocks repair from the 5′-side of the mismatch but not from the 3′-side (34Nicolaides N.C. Littman S. Modrich P. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1635-1641Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). One interpretation of these findings is that like bacterial MutL, human MutLα functions to activate the mismatch repair excision system, but in the case of the human pathway the two subunits of MutLα differentially function to load a 3′ to 5′ or 5′ to 3′ excision system, depending on the location of the strand break that directs the reaction.

Mutation of each tyrosine residue individually revealed that the major sites of tyrosine phosphorylation of SHPS-1 in response to insulin are Tyr449 and Tyr473. In addition, mutation of either Tyr449 or Tyr473 abolished the insulin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of SHPS-1 and its association with SHP-2. Surface plasmon resonance analysis showed that glutathioneS-transferase fusion proteins containing the NH2-terminal or COOH-terminal SH2 domains of SHP-2 bound preferentially to phosphotyrosyl peptides corresponding to the sequences surrounding Tyr449 or Tyr473, respectively, of SHPS-1. Furthermore, phosphotyrosyl peptides containing Tyr449 or Tyr473 were effective substrates for the phosphatase activity of recombinant SHP-2 in vitro. Together, these results suggest that insulin may induce phosphorylation of SHPS-1 at Tyr449 and Tyr473, to which SHP-2 then binds through its NH2-terminal and COOH-terminal SH2 domains, respectively.

Injection of mRNA encoding a catalytically inactive mutant SHP-2 into Xenopus oocytes blocked fibroblast growth factor- and activin-induced induction of mesoderm as well as fibroblast growth factor-induced activation of MAP kinase (9Tang T.L.

SHP-2 has also been suggested to mediate EGF stimulation of the RAS-MAP kinase cascade that leads to DNA synthesis (10Bennett A.M. Hausdorff S.F. O'Reilly A.M. Freeman R.M. Neel B.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1189-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Corkscrew (the putative Drosophila homolog of SHP-2) is thought to be required for Ras1 activation or to function in conjunction with Ras1 during signaling by the Sevenless receptor tyrosine kinase (11Perkins L.A.

Thus, in general, SHP-2 appears to play a positive role in growth factor-induced cell proliferation, probably through activation of the RAS-MAP kinase cascade. SHP-2 is also implicated in insulin signal transduction. The binding of insulin to its receptor stimulates receptor autophosphorylation on tyrosine residues as well as the receptor-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of intracellular substrates such as IRS-1, IRS-2, and GAB-1 (13Sun X.J.

Tyrosine phosphorylation of SHC also plays an important role in insulin-induced activation of the RAS-MAP kinase cascade (25Pronk G.J. de Vries-Smits A.M.M. Buday L. Downward J. Maassen J.A.

Tyrosine-phosphorylated SHC binds to the SH2 domain of the adapter protein GRB2, which is constitutively associated with the guanine nucleotide exchange protein SOS (27Skolnik E.Y. Batzer A. Li N. Lee C.-H. Lowenstein E. Mohammadi M. Morgolis B. Schlessinger J. Science. 1993; 260: 1953-1955Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). SOS catalyzes the exchange of GTP for GDP on RAS, resulting in activation of the RAF-MEK-MAP kinase cascade (28Boguski M.S. McCormick F. Nature. 1993; 366: 643-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (1762) Google Scholar). In addition, the GRB2·SOS complex also binds to tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS-1 (29Skolnik E.Y. Lee C.-H. Batzer A.

Thus, both SHC·GRB2 and IRS-1·GRB2 complexes are implicated in linking IR stimulation to RAS activation. However, the expression of a catalytically inactive SHP-2 does not affect binding of GRB2 to either IRS-1 or SHC in response to insulin, suggesting that SHP-2 may regulate an upstream factor necessary for RAS activation by insulin and that this upstream factor may be required for the GRB2- or SHC-dependent pathway (21Noguchi T. Matozaki T. Horita K. Fujioka Y. Kasuga M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6674-6682Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Because the precise mechanism by which SHP-2 mediates activation of the RAS-MAP kinase cascade in response to insulin is unknown, identification of a phosphorylated substrate of SHP-2 is essential. In an attempt to identify such a physiological substrate of SHP-2, we recently discovered an ∼120-kDa receptor-like glycoprotein, termed SHPS-1, the tyrosine phosphorylation of which was greatly increased in cells overexpressing a catalytically inactive SHP-2 (31Fujioka Y.

Subsequently, we (34Yamao T. Matozaki T. Takahashi N. Amano K. Matsuda Y. Ochi F. Fujioka Y. Kasuga M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 231: 61-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and others (35Kharitonenkov A. Chen Z. Sures I. Wang H. Schilling J. Ullrich A. Nature. 1997; 386: 181-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar) cloned a human homolog of SHPS-1 (also named SIRPα1), and a family of related proteins was also identified (35Kharitonenkov A. Chen Z. Sures I. Wang H. Schilling J. Ullrich A. Nature. 1997; 386: 181-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). The entire putative extracellular region of SHPS-1 consists of three homologous Ig-like domains with multiple N-linked glycosylation sites, indicating that SHPS-1 belongs to the Ig superfamily. The cytoplasmic region of SHPS-1 contains four tyrosine residues each followed by XX(L/V/I) sequences, characteristic of tyrosine phosphorylation sites. These sequences also match well those to which the SH2 domains of SHP-2 prefer to bind as revealed by in vitro binding studies with a phosphotyrosyl peptide library (36Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. Chaudhuri M. Gish G. Pawson T. Haser W.G. King F. Roberts T. Ratnofsky S. Lechleider R.J. Neel B.G. Birge R.B. Fajardo J.E. Chou M.M. Hanafusa H. Schaffhausen B. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1993; 72: 767-778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2391) Google Scholar). Insulin rapidly stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of SHPS-1 and its association with SHP-2, and the IR kinase phosphorylates SHPS-1 on tyrosine residues in vitro, suggesting that SHPS-1 is a direct substrate for the IR kinase (32Noguchi T. Matozaki T. Fujioka Y. Yamao T. Tsuda M. Takada T. Kasuga M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27652-27658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Thus, the SH2 domains of SHP-2 may bind to one or more phosphorylated tyrosine residues in the cytoplasmic region of SHPS-1 in response to insulin. Because sequences corresponding to known catalytic domains are not present in its cytoplasmic region, SHPS-1 appears to be a docking protein, such as IRS, GAB-1, or Drosophila DOS (37Herbst R. Carroll P.M. Allard J.D. Schilling J. Raabe T. Simon M.A. Cell. 1996; 85: 899-909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), that recruits SHP-2 from the cytosol to a region near the plasma membrane in response to insulin. However, little is known of the precise roles of complex formation between SHPS-1 and SHP-2 in insulin regulation of biological activities. In addition, it is not clear which tyrosine residues in the cytoplasmic domain of SHPS-1 are essential for its interaction with SHP-2. We have now generated cells that express wild-type or various mutant forms of SHPS-1. An increase in complex formation between SHPS-1 and SHP-2 induced by overexpression of wild-type SHPS-1 enhanced MAP kinase activation in response to insulin. Furthermore, of the four potential tyrosine phosphorylation sites of SHPS-1, only Tyr449 and Tyr473 are required for the optimal tyrosine phosphorylation of SHPS-1 and the binding of SHP-2 to SHPS-1 in response to insulin. CHO cell lines expressing human IRs (CHO-IR cells) were maintained in Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 10% FBS. CHO-IR cells that overexpress a catalytically inactive SHP-2 (SHP-2-C/S cells) were generated previously (21Noguchi T. Matozaki T. Horita K. Fujioka Y. Kasuga M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6674-6682Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). To generate CHO-IR cells that overexpress various mutant SHPS-1 proteins, we introduced point mutations that changed each or all of the tyrosine residues in the cytoplasmic region (Tyr408, Tyr432, Tyr449, and Tyr473) to phenylalanine into the rat SHPS-1 cDNA by site-directed mutagenesis. The full-length wild-type and mutant SHPS-1 cDNAs were then cloned into the EcoRI site of the pSRα vector. CHO-IR cells (∼5 × 105 cells per 10-cm dish) were transfected with both 10 μg of pSRα containing SHPS-1 cDNA and 1 μg of pHyg, which contains the hygromycin B phosphotransferase gene, with the use of LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.). The cells were cultured in Ham's F-12 medium containing hygromycin B (200 μg/ml) (Wako, Osaka, Japan) and 10% FBS, and colonies were isolated 14–21 days after transfection. Several cell lines expressing wild-type or mutant SHPS-1 proteins were identified by immunoblot analysis of cell lysates with polyclonal antibodies to SHPS-1 as described below. NIH 3T3 cells or Rat-1 cells overexpressing human IRs (Rat-1-IR cells) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% FBS. NIH 3T3 or Rat-1-IR cells that overexpress wild-type SHPS-1 were also generated as described above. To generate a mAb specific to rat SHPS-1, we partially purified SHPS-1 from 100 10-cm plates of confluent SR-3Y1 cells as described previously (31Fujioka Y. Matozaki T. Noguchi T. Iwamatsu A. Yamao T. Takahashi N. Tsuda M. Takada T. Kasuga M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6887-6899Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). The resulting SHPS-1 preparation was injected into the hind footpads of two BALB/c mice three times at 1-week intervals, after which lymphocytes were isolated from the draining lymph nodes and fused with P3U1 myeloma cells as described previously (32Noguchi T. Matozaki T. Fujioka Y. Yamao T. Tsuda M. Takada T. Kasuga M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27652-27658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Antibodies in culture supernatants of the resulting hybridomas were screened on the basis of their ability to immunoprecipitate SHPS-1 from the membrane fraction of SR-3Y1 cells as assessed by immunoblot analysis with antibodies to phosphotyrosine (PY20). Positive hybridomas were rescreened by the same procedure. Among several positive clones, clone 2F34 was chosen, and the corresponding mAb was purified from ascites fluid of mice with a MAPS II kit (Bio-Rad). We found that mAb 2F34 reacts well with rat SHPS-1 but poorly with the corresponding protein of other species such as hamster or mouse. The detailed properties of this mAb will be described elsewhere. In contrast to mAb 2F34, mAb 4C6, which we generated previously (32Noguchi T. Matozaki T. Fujioka Y. Yamao T. Tsuda M. Takada T. Kasuga M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27652-27658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), reacts well with hamster SHPS-1 but poorly with the corresponding protein of rat or mouse. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies to SHPS-1 (31Fujioka Y. Matozaki T. Noguchi T. Iwamatsu A. Yamao T. Takahashi N. Tsuda M. Takada T. Kasuga M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6887-6899Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar) or to SHP-2 (21Noguchi T. Matozaki T. Horita K. Fujioka Y. Kasuga M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6674-6682Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar) were generated with GST fusion proteins containing the COOH-terminal regions of either SHPS-1 or SHP-2 as described previously. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies (α91) to both p44 and p42 MAP kinase were prepared with a synthetic peptide corresponding to residues 307–327 of rat MAP kinase. The rabbit polyclonal antibodies to MAP kinase, α92, were prepared against synthetic peptide corresponding to residues 350–367 of rat MAP kinase. HRP-conjugated mAb PY20 to phosphotyrosine was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Transfected CHO-IR cells, NIH 3T3 cells, or Rat-1-IR cells were deprived of serum for 16 h and then stimulated with insulin. The culture medium was aspirated, and the cells were immediately washed with PBS and frozen in liquid nitrogen. The cells were subsequently lysed on ice in 1 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 140 mm NaCl, 2.6 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% (v/v) glycerol) containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 1 mm sodium vanadate. The lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, and the resulting supernatants (1.0–1.5 mg) were subjected to immunoprecipitation and immunoblot analysis. Supernatants were incubated for 4 h at 4 °C with various antibodies bound to protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The beads were then washed twice with 1 ml of WG buffer (50 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.6), 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100) and resuspended in SDS sample buffer. Gel electrophoresis and immunoblot analysis with various antibodies and an ECL detection kit (Amersham) were performed as described previously (21Noguchi T. Matozaki T. Horita K. Fujioka Y. Kasuga M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6674-6682Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar, 38Matozaki T. Uchida T. Fujioka Y. Kasuga M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 204: 874-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). CHO-IR cells (in four 10-cm plates) treated with or without insulin were frozen in liquid nitrogen, scraped into 2 ml of ice-cold hypotonic lysis solution (20 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.6), 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 5 mm EGTA, 1 mmMgCl2) containing aprotinin (10 mg/ml), 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm sodium vanadate, and homogenized with a Dounce homogenizer. The homogenate was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min, and the resulting supernatant was referred to the cytosolic fraction. The pellet was suspended in 0.5 ml of membrane solubilizaton solution (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1% Triton X-100, 150 mmNaCl, 1 mm MgCl2) supplemented with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 1 mmsodium vanadate. The suspension was centrifuged at 100,000 ×g for 60 min, and the resulting supernatant was referred to as the solubilized membrane fraction. All procedures were performed at 4 °C. MAP kinase activation was monitored by immunoblot analysis of cell lysates with antibodies to p44 and p42 MAP kinase (New England BioLabs) that recognize the enzymes only when they are activated by phosphorylation of Tyr204. MAP kinase activation was also monitored by using the direct in vitro kinase assay as described previously (21Noguchi T. Matozaki T. Horita K. Fujioka Y. Kasuga M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6674-6682Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Briefly, after insulin stimulation, cells were lysed in 500 μl of lysis buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 25 mm NaCl, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm NaF, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 0.5 mm EGTA, 10 nm okadaic acid (Wako Chemicals), and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The lysates were incubated with for 3 h at 4 °C with α92 anti-MAP kinase antibodies that had been bound to protein G-Sepharose beads. The immunoprecipitates were washed twice with lysis buffer and suspended in 35 ml of assay buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 40 μm ATP, 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, 2 mm protein kinase inhibitor (Sigma), and 0.5 mm EGTA, and myelin basic protein (1 μg/ml) (Sigma) as substrate). After incubation for 10 min at 20 °C, the reaction was stopped by adding 10 μl of stop solution, containing 0.6% HCl, 1 mm ATP, and 1% bovine serum albumin. Portions (30 μl) of reaction mixtures were spotted on P-81 paper (Whatman), which was then washed three times with 0.5% phosphoric acid and once with acetone, and the associated radioactivity was determined by a liquid scintillation counter. Recombinant full-length SHP-2 and SH2 domains of SHP-2 were generated with the GST fusion protein system. The polymerase chain reaction was performed as described previously (39Matozaki T. Suzuki T. Uchida T. Inazawa J. Ariyama T. Matsuda K. Horita K. Noguchi H. Mizuno H. Sakamoto C. Kasuga M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2075-2081Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with wild-type SHP-2 cDNA as a template and the following sense and antisense, respectively, oligonucleotide primers: 5′-GGATCCATGACATCGCGGAGATGGTTTCA (nucleotides 113–136) and 5′-AAGAATTCATCTGAAACTTTTCTGCTGTTG (nucleotides 1872–1895) for full-length SHP-2; 5′-GGATCCATGACATCGCGGAGATGGTTTCA (nucleotides 113–136) and 5′-GAATTCTGCACAGTTCAGAGGATATTTAAG (nucleotides 405–428) for the NH2-terminal SH2 domain of SHP-2; and 5′-GGATCCTGGTTTCATGGACATCTCTCTGGG (nucleotides 447–470) and 5′-GAATTCGAGTCGTGTTAAGGGGCTGCTT (nucleotides 750–771) for the COOH-terminal SH2 domain of SHP-2. The amplification products were digested with BamHI and EcoRI and inserted in frame into the BamHI and EcoRI sites of pGEX-2T (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The GST fusion proteins were expressed and purified with glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as described previously (21Noguchi T. Matozaki T. Horita K. Fujioka Y. Kasuga M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6674-6682Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar, 39Matozaki T. Suzuki T. Uchida T. Inazawa J. Ariyama T. Matsuda K. Horita K. Noguchi H. Mizuno H. Sakamoto C. Kasuga M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2075-2081Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The recombinant proteins were then subjected to in vitro binding experiments or PTPase assays with synthetic phosphotyrosyl peptides. Dephosphorylation of synthetic phosphotyrosyl peptides by recombinant SHP-2 was determined by incubating 480 μm phosphotyrosyl peptide with SHP-2 (100 μg/ml) at 30 °C for 20 min in 50 μl of a solution containing 50 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.1), 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm dithiothreitol, and 2 mm EDTA, as described previously (21Noguchi T. Matozaki T. Horita K. Fujioka Y. Kasuga M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6674-6682Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). The reaction was terminated by addition of 950 μl of 0.1 m NaOH. The amount of released inorganic phosphate (Pi) was determined in 50 μl of the mixture with a Phosphor C kit (Wako) by measurement of absorbance at 750 nm. The sequences of the phosphotyrosyl peptides, which were obtained from Peptide Institute (Osaka, Japan), are as follows: IRS-1-pY1172, SLNpYIDLDLVK; IRS-1-pY1222, LSTpYASINFQK; SHPS-1-pY408, DITpYADLNLPK; SHPS-1-pY432, HTEpYASIETGK; SHPS-1-pY449, TLTpYADLDMVH; SHPS-1-pY473, FSEpYASVQVQR; and IR-pY51, KRSpYEEHI (pY indicates the phosphorylated tyrosine). Corresponding nonphosphorylated peptides were also obtained from the same manufacturer. A Biacore 2000 instrument (Biacore, Uppsala, Sweden) was used to measure the interaction between phosphotyrosyl peptides and SH2 domains of SHP-2. In this instrument, the four detection sites are placed on a sensor surface. Immobilization of ligand and all analyses were performed with multichannel detection at a flow rate of 10 μl/min with PBS as eluent. Immobilization of phosphotyrosyl peptides to the CM-5 surface was performed essentially as described (40Felder S. Zhou M. Hu P. Urena J. Ullrich A. Chaudhuri M. White M.F. Shoelson S.E. Schlessinger J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1449-1455Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 41Payne G. Shoelson S.E. Gish G.D. Pawson T. Walsh C.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4902-4906Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Each phosphopeptide (1 mg/ml) dissolved in 1 m NaCl was injected for 7 min onto activated sites 1 and 3, and nonphosphorylated peptides (blank controls) were injected onto sites 2 and 4. All peptide-coupled sites were blocked with 1 m ethanolamine for 7 min to deactivate the remaining active groups. Various concentrations of GST fusions of the NH2-terminal or COOH-terminal SH2 domains of SHP-2 dissolved in PBS were injected simultaneously over all four sites of the sensor surface. After binding and elution, 0.1 m NaOH (two pulses of 1-min duration) was injected to regenerate the surface for another round of binding. The sensorgram for each nonphosphorylated peptide was subtracted from that for the corresponding phosphotyrosyl peptide with BIAevaluation 2.1 software to obtain the sensorgram for the specific interaction. The association constant (Ka) was calculated from the equilibrium binding (Req) value by Scatchard analysis (42Karlsson R. Michaelsson A. Mattsson L. J. Immunol. Methods. 1991; 145: 229-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (1015) Google Scholar). After subtraction of the nonspecific SPR response due to changes in bulk refractive index (determined by injection over a blank surface), Req/C (where Cis the concentration of injected peptide) was plotted againstReq. The Ka and Rmax (maximal binding) values were calculated from the slope and intercept, respectively, by linear least-squares curve-fitting based on the following equation,Req/C = (Ka× Rmax) − (Ka ×Req). The Kd (dissociation constant) value also could be calculated as 1/Ka. We generated CHO-IR cell lines expressing either wild-type rat SHPS-1 (SHPS-1-WT) or a mutant SHPS-1 in which all four tyrosine residues in the cytoplasmic domain were replaced by phenylalanine (SHPS-1–4F). This mutant SHPS-1 protein should not be able to bind SHP-2 in response to insulin. We also prepared the following three different antibodies to SHPS-1 (see “Experimental Procedures”): (i) the mAb 4C6 (32Noguchi T. Matozaki T. Fujioka Y. Yamao T. Tsuda M. Takada T. Kasuga M. J.

To analyze the in vitro folding process with independent structural domains, eight fragments comprising two (AB, FG), three (AC, EG), four (AD, DG) or five (AE, CG) of the transmembrane segments were produced by expression in Escherichia coli. The polypeptides were purified to homogeneity by solvent extraction of E. coli membranes, repeated phase separation, and anion-exchange chromatography employing the C-terminal tail of bacteriorhodopsin for adsorption.

Together with previous studies, these results demonstrate that the covalent connections in each of the six interhelical loops are dispensable for a correct association of the helices. The different loops, however, contribute to the stability of the folded structure, as shown by increased susceptibilities toward denaturation in SDS and at acidic pH, and decreased Schiff base pKa values for the AB·CG, AC·DG, AD·EG, and AE·FG complexes, compared with the intact protein. Notably, the heptahelical bundle structure was also generated by all possible combinations of pairs of overlapping fragments, containing one (AC·CG, AD·DG, AE·EG), two (AD·CG, AE·DG), or three (AE·CG) redundant helices. The spectral properties of the chromophores indicate that the retinal-binding pocket of the AC·CG, AD·CG, and AE·CG complexes is formed by helices A and B of the respective N-terminal fragment and the C-terminal CG fragment, whereas the AD·DG, AE·DG, and AE·EG complexes are likely to adopt a heptahelical bundle structure analogous to AD·EG.

Reconstitution of the native structure has also been accomplished with complementary combinations of proteolytic fragments and synthetic peptides, comprising one or more of the transmembrane regions (7Liao M.J.

Furthermore, refolding and chromophore binding has been demonstrated for numerous mutants containing amino acid substitutions, deletions, or insertions (12Krebs M.P. Khorana H.G. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 1555-1560Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Gilles-Gonzalez M.A. Engelman D.M. Khorana H.G. J. Biol.

By using time-resolved spectroscopy, transient intermediates in the folding process of native BR have recently been identified (16Booth P.J. Flitsch S.L. Stern L.J. Greenhalgh D.A. Kim P.S. Khorana H.G. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 139-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 17Booth P.J. Farooq A. Flitsch S.L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5902-5909Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Second, the structure of BR has been solved at high resolution, revealing the detailed arrangement of the seven membrane-spanning α-helices and of the surface loops (18Pebay-Peyroula E. Rummel G. Rosenbusch J.P. Landau E.M. Science. 1997; 277: 1676-1681Crossref PubMed Scopus (828) Google Scholar, 19Grigorieff N. Ceska T.A. Downing K.H. Baldwin J.M. Henderson R. J. Mol.

Nature. 1997; 389: 206-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). The retinal chromophore is linked covalently through a protonated Schiff base to Lys-216 (Fig. 1) and is located in a central cavity where it contacts each of the seven helices. The membrane topology of BR is shared by the visual pigment rhodopsin, which in turn is a member of the large and functionally diverse superfamily of receptors coupled to guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (3Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1166-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Third, detailed insight into intramolecular interactions present in the ground state and photocycle intermediates of BR has been provided over the past years by the combined application of site-directed mutagenesis and various biophysical techniques (21Lanyi J.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1183: 241-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar, 22Rothschild K.J. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1992; 24: 147-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 23Oesterhelt D. Tittor J. Bamberg E. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1992; 24: 181-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). The majority of these methods have relied on the absorption properties of the retinal chromophore, which represents an extremely sensitive probe to monitor the environment and detect structural changes within the protein. Based on thermodynamic arguments and renaturation experiments on BR, a model for the folding of helical membrane proteins has been proposed, involving two principal steps (24Popot J.L. Engelman D.M. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 4031-4037Crossref PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar, 25Popot J.L. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1993; 3: 532-540Crossref Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 26Lemmon M.A. Engelman D.M. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1994; 27: 157-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). In the first stage, hydrophobic segments insert into the membrane as α-helices, which are independently stabilized by hydrophobic interactions with the bilayer and by main chain hydrogen bonds. In the second stage, the preformed helices assemble without major rearrangement to form the native bundle structure. The transmembrane helix association is driven by helix-helix interactions, external constraints provided by surface loops, lipid-packing effects, and occasionally prosthetic groups (26Lemmon M.A. Engelman D.M. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1994; 27: 157-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). This model predicts that individual transmembrane α-helices represent independent folding domains, since they achieve a defined conformation in the absence of other parts of the molecule. The large degree of structural autonomy of membrane-spanning polypeptides is supported by experiments, in which native structures have been assembled from fragments that were separately refoldedin vitro or synthesized in vivo.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8198-8206Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Specifically, in the case of BR it has been shown that proteolytic fragments comprising the two helices AB 2BR polypeptide fragments are designated by two letters specifying the initial and final transmembrane helix, respectively, of the construct (cf. Fig. 1). The dot symbolizes a missing covalent connection between two fragments. or FG reassociate with the complementary five-helix fragments CG or AE, respectively, to form the native chromophore (7Liao M.J. London E. Khorana H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 9949-9955Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Popot J.L. Gerchman S.E. Engelman D.M. J. Mol.

Biochem. 1988; 177: 125-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 27Hansen O.K. Pompejus M. Fritz H.J. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1994; 375: 715-719PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the BR structure could be regenerated upon substitution of the two-helix fragments by two synthetic peptides corresponding to the individual transmembrane helices (10Kahn T.W. Engelman D.M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 6144-6151Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 11Ozawa S. Hayashi R. Masuda A. Iio T. Takahashi S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1323: 145-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). These results indicate that the A-B, B-C, E-F, and F-G loops are not required for the assembly process, although they contribute to the stability of BR, as shown for the A-B and B-C loops by thermodynamic measurements (35Kahn T.W. Sturtevant J.M. Engelman D.M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 8829-8839Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In contrast, the roles of the short C-D and D-E surface loops (Fig. 1) in folding and stabilization of the protein have not been evaluated, primarily due to a lack of selective accessibility to proteases and availability of an appropriate expression system. To characterize the in vitro folding and assembly process of BR with independent structural domains, an efficient procedure for the production of polypeptide fragments in Escherichia coli has been developed in the present work. By introducing the C-terminal tail of BR as a purification tag into each construct, eight fragments containing two (AB, FG), three (AC, EG), four (AD, DG), or five (AE, CG) of the membrane-spanning helices could be prepared in milligram quantities. Upon reconstitution into phospholipid/detergent micelles, all pairs of fragments comprising complementary (AB·CG,2AC·DG, AD·EG, AE·FG) or overlapping (AC·CG, AD·CG, AD·DG, AE·CG, AE·DG, AE·EG) parts of the protein regenerated a native-like chromophore with high efficiency, whereas in the absence of one or more of the transmembrane segments pigment formation was abolished. This shows that the assembly of BR requires each of the seven helices but does not depend on any of the covalent connections provided by the surface loops. Denaturations in SDS and pH titrations revealed a general destabilization of the chromophores formed by fragment complexes, relative to intact BR. Regions that are susceptible to denaturation were identified in helices D and F-G. The overall results indicate that the C-D and E-F surface loops contribute to the specificity of helix interactions in BR. Purified oligonucleotides were purchased from Eurogentec (Seraing, Belgium), and restriction enzymes were obtained from Pharmacia (Freiburg, Germany) or New England Biolabs (Schwalbach, Germany). Sequenase (version 2.0) and α-35S-dATP (500 Ci/mmol) were from Amersham (Braunschweig, Germany), and DNA purification kits were from Qiagen (Hilden, Germany). Casamino acids and yeast extract were obtained from Difco (Augsburg, Germany), and kanamycin, all-trans-retinal, DMPC, and soybean lipids (l-α-phosphatidylcholine, type II-S) were from Sigma (Deisenhofen, Germany). Ampicillin, DNase I, RNase A, lysozyme, and CHAPS were purchased from Boehringer (Mannheim, Germany). Protran nitrocellulose (0.2 μm) was from Schleicher & Schuell (Dassel, Germany), horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG from Dako (Glostrup, Denmark), and DEAE-Trisacryl from BioSepra (Frankfurt, Germany). Reagents used for N-terminal sequencing and amino acid analysis were obtained from Applied Biosystems (Weiterstadt, Germany). All other chemicals were of analytical grade and purchased from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). The organic solvent compositions for the purification of BO fragments were as follows. Solvent A, chloroform/methanol/water/TEA (100:100:30:1, volume ratios); solvent B, chloroform/methanol/TEA (100:100:1); and solvent C, chloroform/methanol/water (100:100:25). TEA acetate solutions of different concentrations were prepared by adding equimolar amounts of TEA and acetic acid to solvent C. All BO gene fragments were constructed by restriction fragment replacement in the cloning vector pSBO2 that contains a synthetic BO gene (36Nassal M. Mogi T. Karnik S.S. Khorana H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9264-9270Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Oligonucleotide duplexes encoding amino acid deletions in the wild-type protein sequence (Table I) were synthesized to span the following restriction sites (cf. Fig. 1 of Ref. 36Nassal M. Mogi T.

The gene fragments were constructed with a three-component ligation procedure (37Hackett N.R. Stern L.J. Chao B.H. Kronis K.A. Khorana H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9277-9284Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the sequences of sections containing newly synthesized oligonucleotides were confirmed by direct plasmid sequencing (38Sanger F.

Open table in a new tab E. coli strain W3110 harboring the temperature-sensitive repressor plasmid pcI857 was transformed with expression vectors carrying the BO gene fragments. Cells were grown in a 2-liter culture vessel at 30 °C under aeration in a rich medium initially consisting of 50 mm potassium phosphate, 15 mm ammonium sulfate, 4 mm sodium citrate, 2 mm MgSO4, 0.2 mmCaCl2, 1% casamino acids, 0.5% yeast extract, 0.1% glucose, 0.02% tryptophan, with 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 50 μg/ml kanamycin. During cell growth 150 ml of nutrient was added, consisting of 25% glucose, 10% casamino acids, and 5% yeast extract. When the cells reached an A600 of 8–12 (corresponding to 2–3 g dry cell weight/liter), the temperature of the culture was rapidly raised to 42 °C to induce production of BO fragments. After 20 min the cells were harvested by centrifugation (15 min, 5,000 × g, 4 °C) and then frozen. Thawed cells were resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mmMgCl2, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 50 μg/ml DNase I, 20 μg/ml RNase A, 0.5 mg/ml lysozyme, and 0.2 mg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and were disrupted by ultrasonication. Membranes were collected by centrifugation (2 h, 40,000 ×g, 4 °C), lyophilized, and stored at −20 °C. To purify the expressed BO fragments, the procedure developed by Braiman et al. (39Braiman M.S. Stern L.J. Chao B.H. Khorana H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9271-9276Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) for eBO was modified as follows. Lyophilized membranes (∼5 g) were mixed directly with 40 ml of solvent A, and the solution was homogenized thoroughly (2 min, Ultra-Turrax T25 Tissuemizer, IKA-Labortechnik, Staufen, Germany). Following centrifugation (15 min, 5,000 × g, 4 °C), the clear supernatant was decanted and the pellet reextracted with 40 ml of solvent A. The two solvent extracts were combined, and a phase separation was then induced by the addition of an equal volume of water. Following centrifugation (20 min, 5,000 × g, 4 °C), the aqueous and organic phases were both removed by decantation. The solid interface was mixed with solvent B (∼40 ml) until a single liquid phase was obtained. After removal of insoluble material by centrifugation, the phase separation and interface resolubilization steps were repeated. The interface obtained after the third phase separation was redissolved in 25 ml of solvent C containing 30 mm TEA acetate. Following sedimentation of insoluble material, the supernatant was applied to a DEAE-Trisacryl column (1 × 25 cm) equilibrated in solvent C containing 30 mm TEA acetate. The column was washed with 30 mm TEA acetate in solvent C until the absorbance at 280 nm of the eluate reached the base-line value. Elution of BO fragments was performed with a linear gradient of TEA acetate (30–150 mm, using 2 column volumes each of the initial and final concentration) in solvent C. The polypeptide fragments generally eluted from the column at a TEA acetate concentration of about 120 mm. BO fragments were recovered by phase separation of pooled fractions and were redissolved in solvent B. To transfer the proteins into aqueous solutions, an aliquot of 10% (w/v) SDS in water was added. The exact amount of SDS was chosen to give a final SDS/protein ratio of 5:1 (w/w). Following evaporation of the organic solvent in a speedvac concentrator, the BO fragments were redissolved by the addition of water and lyophilized. Purified BO fragments were analyzed by nonreducing SDS-PAGE with a 5% stacking and a 15% resolving gel (40Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207478) Google Scholar). For Western blot analysis, proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose by semidry blotting (41Kyhse-Andersen J. J. Biochem. Biophys. Methods. 1984; 10: 203-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (2158) Google Scholar). Immunoreactive proteins were detected by using BR114 (42Kimura K. Mason T.L. Khorana H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 2859-2867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as primary antibody (dilution 1:2000) and peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG as secondary antibody (dilution 1:800). The protein bands were visualized with 4-chloro-1-naphthol. Protein concentrations were calculated based on the extinction coefficient at 280 nm in 0.2% SDS, determined for the purified fragments by amino acid analysis. Samples of known absorbance at 280 nm were hydrolyzed in the vapor phase with 6 m HCl containing 1% (w/v) phenol for 20 h at 110 °C under vacuum. Norleucine was added as an internal standard prior to hydrolysis. Automated derivatization of liberated amino acids with phenylisothiocyanate was carried out in an amino acid analyzer (model 421, Applied Biosystems), and the resulting phenylthiocarbamyl products were separated with an on-line HPLC system (model 172A, Applied Biosystems). N-terminal amino acid sequences (>25 cycles) of individual fragments were analyzed using an Applied Biosystems model 473A protein sequencer. Initial yields were calculated based on the average yield of phenylthiohydantoin amino acids observed in the first four cycles of sequencing. Chromophores were regenerated by the addition of all-trans-retinal to two fragments present in equimolar amounts (10–18 μm) in a solution containing 1.5% DMPC, 0.5% CHAPS, 0.2% SDS, and 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.0. The kinetics of chromophore formation were measured at 22 °C in the presence of a ≥3-fold molar excess of retinal. Under these conditions the regeneration rates were found to be independent of the retinal concentration. The absorbance increases were monitored at the λmax of the dark-adapted chromophores, using an Uvicon model 930 or 932 spectrophotometer (Kontron, Eching, Germany). The traces of absorbance versus time were fit to the sum of two exponential processes, as described previously (43Stern L.J. Khorana H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14202-14208Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Time constants and amplitudes were calculated using a nonlinear least squares algorithm (Sigmaplot, Jandel Scientific). The λmax values of regenerated BR chromophores were measured at 4 °C after overnight dark adaptation followed by light adaptation for 5 min using a fiber optic illuminator (model A3200, Dolan-Jenner, Lawrence, MA) equipped with a 475-nm long-pass filter. Extinction coefficients of fragment complexes were determined by acid denaturation in the dark to give a chromophore with λmax at 442 nm (44Marti T. Otto H. Mogi T. Rösselet S.J. Heyn M.P. Khorana H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6919-6927Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The ratio of the absorption at the λmax to the absorption at 442 nm after acidification to pH 2.2 was compared with that of wild-type eBR. The extinction coefficient of eBR was assumed to be 52,000m−1 cm−1 (6London E. Khorana H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 7003-7011Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Spectrometric titrations of regenerated chromophores were carried out in steps of 0.1–0.3 pH units by adding microliter aliquots of 0.1–2 nH2SO4 or 0.1–5 m NaOH. Following complete equilibration (∼3 min), pH readings and absorption spectra were recorded for each point. The amount of titrated pigment was determined from difference spectra as described (45Marti T. Rösselet S.J. Otto H. Heyn M.P. Khorana H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18674-18683Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For the transition to a deprotonated Schiff base at alkaline pH, the absorbance increase at 365 nm was measured. Denaturation at acidic pH was assessed based on the formation of a 442-nm absorbing protonated Schiff base devoid of retinal-protein interactions. The absorbance change ΔA was then plotted versus the pH, and the pKa values as well as the number of protons involved in the transition were obtained from a previously reported three-parameter curve that was fitted to the data points (45Marti T. Rösselet S.J. Otto H. Heyn M.P. Khorana H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18674-18683Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To evaluate the chromophore stability toward SDS, fragment complexes were regenerated as described above and diluted in the dark at a ratio of 4:5 (v/v) with solutions containing 1.5% DMPC, 0.5% CHAPS, and varying amounts of SDS to give final SDS concentrations of 0.2–2% (w/v). Following equilibration for 20 h at room temperature, the extent of denaturation was determined from dark-adapted UV-visible absorption spectra. For proton-pumping measurements, regenerated BR fragment complexes were reconstituted into soybean lipid vesicles by detergent dilution. Light-dependent pH changes were recorded in 2 mNaCl according to a previously described procedure (46Sonar S. Marti T. Rath P. Fischer W. Coleman M. Nilsson A. Khorana H.G. Rothschild K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28851-28858Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Eight polypeptide fragments comprising two (AB, FG), three (AC, EG), four (AD, DG), or five (AE, CG) of the transmembrane regions of BR were prepared. The strategy used for the production of the fragments was based on previously developed procedures for the expression of wild-type BO and site-specific variants in E. coli (36Nassal M. Mogi T. Karnik S.S. Khorana H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9264-9270Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Hackett N.R. Stern L.J. Chao B.H. Kronis K.A. Khorana H.G. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2092173338,"The cGMP-gated cation channel mediating phototransduction in retinal rods has recently been shown to be inhibited by calcium-calmodulin, through direct binding of the latter to the β-subunit of the heterotetrameric channel complex. Here, we report the characterization of this inhibition and the identification of a domain crucial for this modulation. Heterologous expression of the α- and β-subunits of the human rod channel in HEK 293 cells produced a cGMP-gated current that was highly sensitive to calcium-calmodulin, with half-maximal inhibition at approximately 4 nm. In biochemical and electrophysiological experiments on deletion mutants of the β-subunit, we have identified a region on its cytoplasmic N terminus that binds calmodulin and is necessary for the calmodulin-mediated inhibition of the channel. However, in gel shift assays and fluorescence emission experiments, peptides derived from this region indicated a low calmodulin affinity, with dissociation constants of approximately 3–10 μm. On the C terminus, a region was also found to bind calmodulin, but it was likewise of low affinity, and its deletion did not abolish the calmodulin-mediated inhibition. We suggest that although the identified region on the N terminus of the β-subunit is crucial for the calmodulin effect, other regions are likely to be involved as well. In this respect, the rod channel appears to differ from the olfactory cyclic nucleotide-gated channel, which is also modulated by calcium-calmodulin. The cGMP-gated cation channel mediating phototransduction in retinal rods has recently been shown to be inhibited by calcium-calmodulin, through direct binding of the latter to the β-subunit of the heterotetrameric channel complex. Here, we report the characterization of this inhibition and the identification of a domain crucial for this modulation. Heterologous expression of the α- and β-subunits of the human rod channel in HEK 293 cells produced a cGMP-gated current that was highly sensitive to calcium-calmodulin, with half-maximal inhibition at approximately 4 nm. In biochemical and electrophysiological experiments on deletion mutants of the β-subunit, we have identified a region on its cytoplasmic N terminus that binds calmodulin and is necessary for the calmodulin-mediated inhibition of the channel. However, in gel shift assays and fluorescence emission experiments, peptides derived from this region indicated a low calmodulin affinity, with dissociation constants of approximately 3–10 μm. On the C terminus, a region was also found to bind calmodulin, but it was likewise of low affinity, and its deletion did not abolish the calmodulin-mediated inhibition. We suggest that although the identified region on the N terminus of the β-subunit is crucial for the calmodulin effect, other regions are likely to be involved as well. In this respect, the rod channel appears to differ from the olfactory cyclic nucleotide-gated channel, which is also modulated by calcium-calmodulin. Visual transduction in retinal rods involves a light-triggered signaling cascade that leads to a decrease in cGMP concentration (for review, see Refs. 1Lagnado L. Baylor D.A.

In darkness, cytoplasmic cGMP binds to and opens cGMP-gated, nonselective cation channels on the plasma membrane (for review, see Refs. 4Yau K.-W. Baylor D.A. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1989; 12: 289-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar, 5Kaupp U.B. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1995; 5: 434-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 6Finn J.T. Grunwald M.E.

Neurosci. 1996; 19: 235-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). These open channels sustain an inward dark current, carried predominantly by Na+ and Ca2+, that keeps the cell depolarized. In the light, the hydrolysis of cGMP leads to the closure of these channels, resulting in a membrane hyperpolarization as the electrical response. When the cGMP-activated channels close, the Ca2+ influx into the rod outer segment stops, but a Ca2+ efflux through a Na+/Ca2+, K+ exchanger continues, leading to a decrease in the cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration in the outer segment. This decrease in Ca2+ triggers a negative feedback to produce light adaptation of the rod (for review, see Ref. 3Koutalos Y. Yau K.-W. Trends Neurosci. 1996; 19: 73-81Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). One mechanism underlying this Ca2+ feedback involves a reduction of the apparent affinity of the channel for cGMP (8Nakatani K. Koutalos Y. Yau K.-W. J.

Visual Neurosci. 1997; 14: 233-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The rod channel belongs to a family of cyclic nucleotide-activated, nonselective cation channels now known to be important for both visual and olfactory transduction pathways (for review, see Refs. 5Kaupp U.B. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1995; 5: 434-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 6Finn J.T. Grunwald M.E. Yau K-W. Annu. Rev.

These channels are ligand-gated, being opened directly by cGMP and cAMP. They are composed of at least two subunit species (α and β, or 1 and 2) most probably forming heterotetrameric complexes (15Gordon S.E. Zagotta W.N. Neuron. 1995; 14: 857-864Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 16Liu D.T. Tibbs G.R. Siegelbaum S.A. Neuron. 1996; 16: 983-990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The α-subunit, but not the β-subunit, is capable of forming functional homomeric channels. Like the Shaker superfamily of potassium channels, both subunits have six transmembrane domains and a putative β-hairpin that forms part of the pore. The cyclic nucleotide-binding site is situated on the cytoplasmic C terminus and is homologous to the binding sites found on the cyclic nucleotide-activated kinases protein kinase C and protein kinase A, and the Escherichia coli catabolite gene activator protein, CAP (see Refs. 5Kaupp U.B. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1995; 5: 434-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 6Finn J.T. Grunwald M.E. Yau K-W. Annu. Rev.

The reduction in affinity of the rod cGMP-gated channel for cGMP involves Ca2+-CaM binding to the β-subunit (Refs. 17Chen T.-Y. Illing M. Molday L.L. Hsu Y.-T. Yau K.-W. Molday R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11757-11761Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar and18Körschen H. Illing M. Seifert R. Williams A. Gotzes S. Colville C. Müller F. Dosé A. Godde M. Kaupp U.B.

A similar, but more potent, inhibition by Ca2+-CaM was found for the olfactory cyclic nucleotide-gated channel, although in this case the modulation involves Ca2+-CaM binding to the α-subunit of the channel (21Chen T.-Y. Yau K.-W. Nature. 1994; 368: 545-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar,22Liu M. Chen T.-Y. Ahamed B. Li J. Yau K.-W. Science. 1994; 266: 1348-1354Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which the olfactory channel is modulated by Ca2+-CaM has been elucidated (22Liu M. Chen T.-Y. Ahamed B. Li J. Yau K.-W. Science. 1994; 266: 1348-1354Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). A domain on the N terminus of the olfactory channel α-subunit influences gating by promoting the open state of the liganded channel. When Ca2+-CaM binds to this domain, the influence of the latter on channel gating is removed, leading to a decrease in the apparent affinity of the channel for cGMP due to the coupling of ligand binding and channel gating. Most recently, it has been reported that the N and C termini of the olfactory channel α-subunit interact directly with each other and that the domain on the N terminus that is important for this interaction coincides with the Ca2+-CaM-binding site (23Varnum M.D. Zagotta W.N. Science. 1997; 278: 110-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). When Ca2+-CaM binds, the interaction between the two termini disappears (23Varnum M.D. Zagotta W.N. Science. 1997; 278: 110-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Presumably, this interaction influences the gating of the channel and accounts for the ability of Ca2+-CaM to modulate the channel. In this paper, we address the question of how the rod channel is modulated by Ca2+-CaM. In an electrophysiological approach, we recorded cGMP-activated currents in the absence and presence of Ca2+-CaM from excised, inside-out membrane patches of HEK 293 cells expressing the human rod channel α- and β-subunits. Furthermore, site-directed mutagenesis and biochemical binding studies were carried out to identify the Ca2+-CaM-binding domain on the β-subunit important for this modulation. The results indicate similarities, but also differences, between the rod and olfactory channels with respect to the CaM inhibition. Poly(A)+ RNA was isolated from bovine retina with the oligo(dT)-selection method (Micro-FastTrack, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Oligo(dT)-primed cDNA was then synthesized using the SuperScriptTM Choice system (Life Technologies, Inc.). Using this cDNA as template, PCR was performed with the primers AGGAAGAAGGCAAGTCCTG and ATGGGCTTGATCTCCAAGG, corresponding to nucleotides −50 to −32 and 635–617 of the cDNA coding for bovine GARP (glutamic acid-rich protein; Ref. 24Sugimoto Y. Yatsunami K. Tsujimoto M. Khorana H.G. Ichikawa A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3116-3119Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The PCR product with the appropriate size was isolated, sequenced, and used as a probe to screen an adult human retinal cDNA library in λgt10. Six positive clones were isolated. The clones fell into two groups according to their restriction patterns. One clone from each group was used for further characterization. The inserts were subcloned into pCIS and sequenced. These two clones, named hGARP1.6 and hGARP2.5, shared a common 5′-region of 0.9 kb but were divergent in their 3′-regions. The 3′-region of hGARP2.5 overlapped with the 5′-end of the hRCNC2b clone described in Chen et al. (25Chen T.-Y. Peng Y.-W. Dhallan R.S. Ahamed B. Reed R.R. Yau K.-W. Nature. 1993; 362: 764-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar) (see “Results”). To combine hGARP2.5 and hRCNC2b, two of three Bsu36I sites in hGARP2.5 were deleted by silent mutations. ABsu36I-BamHI fragment from hRCNC2b (spanning nucleotides 417–2849) was then ligated into hGARP2.5, generating a clone that appears to code for the full-length β-subunit of the human rod channel, by comparison to the bovine ortholog. In this paper, we refer to hRCNC2b as the trunc-β-subunit and to the full-length β-subunit as the full-β-subunit. The cDNAs coding for the human rod cGMP-activated channel α-subunit (corresponding to hRCNC1 in Ref. 26Dhallan R.S. Macke J.P. Eddy R.L. Shows T.B. Reed R.R. Yau K.-W. Nathans J. J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 3248-3256Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and renamed hRCNCα here) and the trunc-β- or full-β-subunit were subcloned in the pCIS expression vector and cotransfected into human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells (American Type Culture Collection) using the calcium-phosphate method (27Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 7: 2745-2752Crossref Scopus (4799) Google Scholar). For hRCNCα, a Kozak consensus sequence (28Kozak M. Cell. 1986; 44: 283-292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3555) Google Scholar) had been introduced into its 5′-region, which enhanced the level of protein expression by a modest degree. HEK 293 cells were cultured at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and penicillin/streptomycin in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. At 2–4 days after transfection, current recordings were made from voltage-clamped, excised, inside-out membrane patches using an EPC-9 patch-clamp amplifier and the PULSE/PULSE-FIT software package (both from HEKA Elektronik, Lamprecht, Germany, distributed by Instrutech, Great Neck, NY). The signals were low pass filtered at 2.9 kHz (4-pole Bessel filter). The patch pipettes were made from borosilicate glass capillaries, with a tip-lumen diameter of 1–1.5 μm and a resistance of 2–4 MΩ. The relatively low signal-to-noise ratio in some of the traces had resulted from the small magnitudes of the currents and the lack of signal averaging. For zero-Ca2+ conditions, the pipette and bath solutions both contained 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm EGTA, and 10 mm HEPES/NaOH, pH 7.4. In experiments involving Ca2+-CaM, the bath was perfused with a solution containing CaM at a specified concentration and also 50 μm buffered free Ca2+ (achieved by substituting 2 mm nitrilotriacetic acid and 704 μm CaCl2 for the EGTA). cGMP was added to the bath solution as needed. In experiments involving the β-subunit, the cGMP-activated current was always tested for blockage at +60 mV by 10 μml-cis-diltiazem applied to the bath solution to verify its functional expression (25Chen T.-Y. Peng Y.-W. Dhallan R.S. Ahamed B. Reed R.R. Yau K.-W. Nature. 1993; 362: 764-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). A solenoid-controlled rotary valve system (29Nakatani K. Yau K.-W. J. Physiol. 1988; 395: 731-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) was used to change the bath solution, and the solution change around the membrane patch was complete within 1–2 s. All experiments were performed at room temperature. Deletion mutants were generated by performing site-directed mutagenesis on the cDNAs coding for the trunc-β- and full-β-subunits. For binding studies, fusion protein constructs containing the cytoplasmic N terminus (amino acid residues 1–313) or C terminus (residues 535–908) of the trunc-β-subunit were made by PCR amplification using primers with flanking BamHI and EcoRI sites and subcloning the PCR fragments into pGEX-2T (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The resulting constructs were transformed into E. coli BL21 cells, and the fusion proteins were isolated and purified using the Bulk GST purification module from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Fluorescence experiments to measure the binding of peptides to Ca2+ CaM were performed using the Perkin-Elmer Luminescence Spectrometer LS50B. Peptides, representing putative Ca2+-CaM-binding sites on the trunc-β-subunit, were synthesized in the Howard Hughes Medical Institute Biopolymer Facility at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. Dansyl-CaM (Sigma) was incubated at a given concentration with increasing peptide concentration in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.3, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.5 mm CaCl2 or 2 mm EGTA. The emission spectrum at 400–600 nm was recorded using an excitation wavelength of 340 nm, the bandwidth being 10–15 nm for both excitation and emission. The increase in fluorescence at 480 nm was used to assay for the concentration of dansyl-CaM bound to peptide. Assuming a 1:1 stoichiometry of binding between Ca2+-CaM and peptide, the fraction of peptide, fb, bound to CaM is given by the equation fb = (Im− If)/(Ib −If), where If is the dansyl-CaM fluorescence with no peptide present,Ib is the fluorescence when all dansyl-CaM is bound to peptide, and Im is the fluorescence of intermediate mixtures (see Ref. 22Liu M. Chen T.-Y. Ahamed B. Li J. Yau K.-W. Science. 1994; 266: 1348-1354Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). The dissociation constant,Kd, between Ca2+-CaM and the peptide was derived from the relationship between the fractional increase of fluorescence and the calculated concentration of free peptide. According to vendor specifications, the mole ratio between the dansyl moiety and CaM in dansyl-CaM is about 0.6. However, this factor does not influence the results, provided that CaM and dansyl-CaM behave identically in the binding experiments. A polyclonal antibody, Ab1859, was raised in rabbit (HRP Inc., Denver, PA) against the resin-coupled peptide MLGWVQRVLPQPPGTPRKTK, which corresponds to amino acids 1–20 in the full-β-subunit (see Fig. 1 B). For immunoprecipitation experiments, the antibody was purified by protein A-Sepharose chromatography. Ab1859 cross-reacts with the bovine homolog of the protein. Overlay experiments were performed on purified fusion proteins (see above), retinal lysates, and the heterologously expressed full-β-subunit. Retinal lysates were prepared from human retinal tissue that had been isolated and frozen in liquid nitrogen within 5 h post-mortem. The low salt lysis buffer contained 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1% Triton X-100. For the heterologously expressed full-β-subunit, HEK 293 cells were harvested 3–4 days after transfection and lysed in the above low salt buffer. The β-subunit was immunoprecipitated by incubating the cell lysate with 10 μg of the purified Ab1859 antibody and a suspension of protein A-Sepharose (Sigma) for 2 h at 4 °C. Alternatively, the antibody was covalently coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B and used instead. The fusion proteins, retinal lysates, and immunoprecipitates were loaded on SDS gels and transferred to nitrocellulose (TransBlot, Bio-Rad) or polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon, Millipore, Bedford, MA) in 10 mm CAPS, pH 10.8, or Towbin buffer containing 2–10% methanol (30Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44643) Google Scholar). After transfer, the blots were probed with CaM-coupled alkaline phosphatase or biotinylated CaM in the presence of 0.1–1 mm Ca2+ or 5 mmEGTA. The synthesis of CaM-coupled alkaline phosphatase and the detection procedure were both according to Walker et al.(31Walker R.G. Hudspeth A.J. Gillespie P.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2807-2811Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In assays with biotinylated CaM, the membranes were blocked in a buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm CaCl2 or 5 mm EGTA, 0.1% antifoam A, and 5% nonfat dry milk for 30 min. Biotinylated CaM (Biomedical Technologies, Stoughton, MA) was added to give a final concentration of 1 μg/ml, followed by an incubation for 1–2 h at room temperature. After extensive washing in the same buffer without additives, the membrane was incubated with avidin and horseradish peroxidase (ABC system, Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) and developed using the ECL system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For Western blotting, the membranes were blocked in 2% nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline (140 mm NaCl, 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5) and incubated with the antibodies in the same buffer for 1 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C. The antibody Ab1859 was used at 1:2000 dilution. Fusion proteins were detected using the commercially available anti-glutathione S-transferase (GST) antibody (Amrad, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia) at a dilution of 1:5000. The bands were visualized using an horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibody (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) or the ABC system (Vector Laboratories). For Western blotting after the CaM overlay experiment, blots were stripped using 1% SDS, 1 mm EDTA in Tris-buffered saline. CaM (375 pmol) was incubated with different molar amounts of peptide in a buffer containing 10 mm HEPES/NaOH (pH 7.2) and 2 mmCaCl2 or 5 mm EGTA, respectively, for 30 min at room temperature. The CaM-peptide complexes were then resolved by nondenaturing gel electrophoresis on 15% gels according to standard procedures for SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, but omitting SDS and adding 2 mm CaCl2 or 5 mm EGTA, respectively. Bands were visualized by Coomassie Blue staining. Previously, we cloned the cDNA for a β-subunit of the human rod cGMP-gated channel (hRCNC2b; see Ref. 25Chen T.-Y. Peng Y.-W. Dhallan R.S. Ahamed B. Reed R.R. Yau K.-W. Nature. 1993; 362: 764-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Subsequently, this clone appeared to be a truncated form of the cDNA for the full-length β-subunit, with the coded protein missing a segment of the N terminus (17Chen T.-Y. Illing M. Molday L.L. Hsu Y.-T. Yau K.-W. Molday R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11757-11761Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 18Körschen H. Illing M. Seifert R. Williams A. Gotzes S. Colville C. Müller F. Dosé A. Godde M. Kaupp U.B. Molday R.S. Neuron. 1995; 15: 627-636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, when expressed, the truncated human protein exhibited all of the hallmark properties of the bovine full-length protein that was subsequently cloned by Körschenet al. (18Körschen H. Illing M. Seifert R. Williams A. Gotzes S. Colville C. Müller F. Dosé A. Godde M. Kaupp U.B. Molday R.S. Neuron. 1995; 15: 627-636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). One of these common properties is the modulation by Ca2+-CaM. In this study, we obtained the human full-length channel cDNA to use for experiments. We generated a probe by performing PCR on cDNA synthesized from bovine retinal poly(A)+-RNA, using primers based on the 5′-segment (the GARP region) of the bovine full-length β-subunit (Ref. 24Sugimoto Y. Yatsunami K. Tsujimoto M. Khorana H.G. Ichikawa A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3116-3119Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar; see also Ref. 18Körschen H. Illing M. Seifert R.

This probe was used to screen an adult human retinal cDNA library (see “Experimental Procedures”). Two different types of clones were obtained. One clone, named hGARP1.6 (see Fig. 1), is identical to a human cDNA clone previously published by Ardell et al. (32Ardell M.D. Aragon I. Oliveira L. Porche G.E. Burke E. Pittler S.J. FEBS Lett. 1996; 389: 213-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and to the human t-GARP clone more recently reported by Colville and Molday (33Colville C.A. Molday R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32968-32974Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), except for the absence of six amino acid residues (GAASDP) at position 188 in our hGARP1.6 (indicated by insertion in Fig. 1; see also Refs.32Ardell M.D. Aragon I. Oliveira L. Porche G.E. Burke E. Pittler S.J. FEBS Lett. 1996; 389: 213-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar and 33Colville C.A. Molday R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32968-32974Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The reason for this difference is unclear, because it appeared that the same cDNA library was used by all three groups. The hGARP1.6 clone shares a common 5′ region with the other clone, hGARP2.5, but has a unique 3′ region that can also be found in the genomic DNA for the β-subunit (data not shown), suggesting that it is a differentially spliced variant. hGARP1.6 was not pursued further. As for hGARP2.5, its 3′-end shows regions of identity with the 5′-end of the translated region of hRCNC2b, except that it has an extra insertion of 264 bases and a unique tail (Fig. 1); furthermore, there is a stop codon 147 bases into the insertion. In the translated protein from this clone, the C terminus overlaps with the N terminus of hRCNC2b for a stretch of 117 amino acids, followed by a unique stretch of 49 residues. The overall protein coded by the hGARP2.5 clone has 502 amino acids and a calculated molecular mass of 55,322 Da. However, in SDS-gels, the expressed protein showed an apparent molecular mass of around 110 kDa (Fig. 2 A, hGARP2.5), probably because of its high glutamic acid content. hGARP2.5 is presumably the human equivalent of the bovine f-GARP described by Colville and Molday (33Colville C.A. Molday R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32968-32974Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). We fused hGARP2.5 and hRCNC2b using Bsu36I and BamHI restriction sites to produce a single 3.8-kb insert coding for the complete β-subunit of the human rod channel (see Fig. 1), by comparison to the bovine ortholog (18Körschen H. Illing M. Seifert R. Williams A. Gotzes S. Colville C. Müller F. Dosé A. Godde M. Kaupp U.B. Molday R.S. Neuron. 1995; 15: 627-636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). The translated protein has 1245 amino acid residues and a calculated molecular mass of 139,160 Da. The protein, obtained either directly from lysate of transfected HEK 293 cells or by immunoprecipitation from the lysate with an antibody (Ab1859) generated against its GARP part (see “Experimental Procedures”), migrated on an SDS-gel with an apparent molecular mass of approximately 220 kDa (Fig. 2, A and B). This full-length clone is identical to that recently identified by Colville and Molday (33Colville C.A. Molday R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32968-32974Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), except again for the missing six residues in our protein described above. Co-transfection of HEK 293 cells with this full-length β-subunit cDNA and that for hRCNCα (renamed from hRCNC1 of Ref. 26Dhallan R.S. Macke J.P. Eddy R.L. Shows T.B. Reed R.R. Yau K.-W. Nathans J. J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 3248-3256Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) produced cGMP-activated channels with properties very similar to those observed in co-transfections involving the hRCNCα and hRCNC2b cDNAs. For instance, both types of heteromeric channels were blocked byl-cis-diltiazem (see Fig. 2 C for channels containing the full-length β-subunit). Also, Ca2+-CaM inhibited both types of channels to about the same extent. This is consistent with the results obtained by Körschenet al. (18Körschen H. Illing M. Seifert R. Williams A. Gotzes S. Colville C. Müller F. Dosé A. Godde M. Kaupp U.B. Molday R.S. Neuron. 1995; 15: 627-636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) with the bovine protein. We refer to hRCNC2b as the trunc-β-subunit and to the full-length β-subunit as the full-β-subunit. We first characterized the inhibition of the α/β-heteromeric rod channel by Ca2+-CaM in greater detail than before (17Chen T.-Y. Illing M. Molday L.L. Hsu Y.-T. Yau K.-W. Molday R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11757-11761Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The cDNAs for the α- and trunc-β-subunits were transfected into HEK 293 cells and the macroscopic cGMP-activated current was recorded from excised, inside-out membrane patches. At −60 mV, 60 μm cGMP evoked a current less than half-maximum, and 250 nm CaM reversibly inhibited this current by 60–80% in the presence of 50 μm Ca2+ (Fig. 3 A). In the absence of Ca2+, CaM was unable to elicit the inhibitory effect (data not shown). Also, the recovery of the current from the Ca2+-CaM inhibition required the removal of both CaM and Ca2+ (Fig. 3 A). Fig. 3 B shows the dose-response relationships, averaged from two patches, between current activation and cGMP concentration in the absence and presence of Ca2+-CaM, respectively. In the presence of CaM, the dose-response relationship was shifted by about 2-fold to higher cGMP concentrations. This extent of shift is consistent with our previous finding (17Chen T.-Y. Illing M. Molday L.L. Hsu Y.-T. Yau K.-W. Molday R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11757-11761Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). To investigate the relationship between the extent of channel inhibition and Ca2+-CaM concentration, we evoked a current from a patch at −60 mV with 60 μm cGMP and measured the extent of inhibition of this current at different CaM concentrations in the presence of 50 μm Ca2+ (Fig. 3 C). One or two low CaM concentrations were tested on each patch, and the inhibition of channel activity was normalized with respe"

The enzyme was purified to apparent homogeneity from the serum-free culture medium of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells (Habuchi, H., Habuchi, O., and Kimata, K. (1995)J. Biol Chem. 270, 4172–4179). From the amino acid sequence data of the purified enzyme, degenerate oligonucleotides were designed and used as primers for the reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction using poly(A)+ RNA from CHO cells as a template. The amplified cDNA fragment was then used as a probe to screen a cDNA library of CHO cells. The cDNA clone thus obtained encoded a partial peptide sequence composed of 236 amino acid residues that included the sequences of six peptides obtained after endoproteinase digestion of the purified enzyme. This cDNA clone was applied to the screening of a human fetal brain cDNA library by cross-hybridization. The isolated cDNA clones contained a whole open reading frame that predicts a type II transmembrane protein composed of 401 amino acid residues. No significant amino acid sequence identity to any other proteins, including heparan-sulfate 2-sulfotransferases, was observed. When the cDNA for the entire coding sequence of the protein was inserted into a eukaryotic expression vector and transfected into COS-7 cells, the HS6ST activity increased 7-fold over the control. The FLAG fusion protein purified by anti-FLAG affinity chromatography showed the HS6ST activity alone. Northern blot analysis revealed the occurrence of a single transcript of 3.9 kilobases in both human fetal brain and CHO cells. The results, together with the ones from our recent cDNA analysis of heparan-sulfate 2-sulfotransferase (Kobayashi, M., Habuchi, H., Yoneda, M., Habuchi, O., and Kimata, K. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 13980–13985), suggest that at least two different gene products are responsible for 6- and 2-O-sulfations of heparan sulfate.

Chem. 272, 13980–13985), suggest that at least two different gene products are responsible for 6- and 2-O-sulfations of heparan sulfate. Heparan sulfate proteoglycans are ubiquitously present on the cell surface and in the extracellular matrix, including the basement membrane (1Yanagishita M. Hascall V.C. J. Biol.

The interactions of heparan sulfate with various ligands seem to be mediated by specific regions of heparan sulfate with different, albeit overlapping, structures. Heparan sulfate is required for high affinity binding of fibroblast growth factors to their receptors as well as for oligomerization of fibroblast growth factors themselves (15Yayon A. Klagsbrun M.

The structure of the fibroblast growth factor 2-binding region in heparan sulfate is represented by a cluster of IdceA(2SO4)-GlcNSO3 units (18Habuchi H. Suzuki S. Saito T. Tamura T. Harada T.

An additional structural region of heparan sulfate, containing a IdceA(2SO4)-GlcNSO3(6SO4) unit, is required for the signal transduction with fibroblast growth factor 2 (23Ishihara M. Tyrrell D.J.

Hepatocyte growth factor is a heparin-binding polypeptide and has also been shown to have affinity for the regions of heparan sulfate that contain at least two repeating IdceA(2SO4)-GlcNSO3(6SO4) units/octasaccharide (25Lyon M.

The binding of hepatocyte growth factor to heparan sulfate may modulate the mitogenic activity of hepatocyte growth factor (27Naka D. Ishii T. Shimomura T. Hishida T. Hara H. Exp.

The ability of cells to produce heparan sulfate with the specific structural regions described above depends on the specific mechanism of heparan sulfate biosynthesis (30Salmivirta M. Lidholt K.

Two kinds ofN-deacetylase/N-sulfotransferases, one (N-deacetylase/N-sulfotransferase-1) from heparan sulfate-producing rat liver (32Brandan E. Hirschberg C.B. J. Biol.

The specificities of these two kinds of enzymes appear to be different with respect to the extent ofN-sulfation. Heparan-sulfate glucosaminyl-3-O-sulfotransferase was also purified and cloned and found to exist as three isoforms, the substrate specificities of which appear to be different from each other (31Rosenberg R.D. Shworak N.W. Liu J. Schwartz J. Zhang L. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 2062-2070Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 37Liu J. Shworak N.W. Fritze L.M.S. Edelberg J.M. Rosenberg R.D. J. Biol.

The occurrence of such isoforms with different substrate specificities may be responsible for further structural diversity of heparan sulfate. We previously purified heparan-sulfate 6-O-sulfotransferase (HS6ST) 1The abbreviations used are: HS6ST, heparan-sulfate 6-sulfotransferase; HS2ST, heparan-sulfate 2-sulfotransferase; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; PCR, polymerase chain reaction. (35Habuchi H. Habuchi O. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4172-4179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) and heparan-sulfate 2-O-sulfotransferase (HS2ST) (36Kobayashi M. Habuchi H. Habuchi O. Saito M. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7645-7653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) to apparent homogeneity from the medium and cell layer of a CHO cell culture, respectively. The sequence information from the purified HS2ST has recently enabled us to perform the cloning of the hamster HS2ST cDNA (41Kobayashi M. Habuchi H. Yoneda M. Habuchi O. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13980-13985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The transfection of the vector containing the cloned cDNA into COS-7 cells resulted in the overexpression of the HS2ST activity alone. In contrast, Wlad et al. (34Wlad H. Maccarana M. Eriksson I. Kjellen L. Lindahl U. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24538-24541Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reported the presence of a 60-kDa enzyme in mouse mastocytoma tissue that contained both HS2ST and HS6ST activities. The molecular cloning of HS6ST may be helpful to assess the above discrepancy between our results and those of Wlad et al. and to understand the regulatory mechanisms of the 6- and 2-O-sulfations in heparan sulfate biosynthesis. In this study, we cloned the cDNAs containing the entire and partial coding sequences of human and hamster HS6ST, respectively, and further showed that the protein expressed in COS-7 cells by transfection with the expression vector containing the cloned human cDNA had the HS6ST activity alone. HS6ST was purified from the serum-free culture medium of CHO cell as described previously (35Habuchi H. Habuchi O. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4172-4179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The purified HS6ST was subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis according to the method of Laemmli (43Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1990; 227: 680-685Crossref Scopus (207472) Google Scholar) and then electrotransferred onto ProBlott polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Applied Biosystems, Inc.). The transferred protein was visualized with Ponceau S. The bands of the 45- and 52-kDa proteins, which had the HS6ST activity (35Habuchi H. Habuchi O. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4172-4179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), were excised, and a part of the membrane was used for N-terminal amino acid sequencing. The remaining membrane of the 45-kDa protein was subjected to reduction and S-carboxymethylation. After digestion withN-glycanase, the membrane was digested sequentially with endoproteinase Lys-C and then endoproteinase Asp-N followed by trypsin according to Iwamatsu (44Iwamatsu A. Electrophoresis. 1992; 13: 42-147Crossref Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Each endoproteinase digest was subjected to reverse-phase capillary HPLC and eluted with a gradient of 2–100% solvent A (80% acetonitrile in 0.052% trifluoroacetic acid). The amino acid sequences of the separated peptides were analyzed with a Model 476A protein sequenator (Applied Biosystems, Inc.). Based on the amino acid sequences of peptides derived from the purified HS6ST, degenerate primers of both sense and antisense strands were designed with deoxyinosine substitutions as indicated in Fig. 1 A. A reverse transcriptase reaction was performed at 50 °C for 1 h using poly(A)+ RNA from CHO cells as a template and a mixture of oligo(dT) and random hexamer as a primer. The PCR was carried out in a final volume of 50 μl containing 100 pmol of each primer, 5-μl aliquots of reverse transcriptase reaction mixture, 0.25 mm each dNTP, and 1.25 units of AmpliTaq polymerase (Perkin-Elmer) under the conditions of 35 cycles of denaturation at 95 °C for 1 min, annealing at 46–56 °C for 1 min, and extension at 72 °C for 2 min. PCR products were subjected to agarose gel electrophoresis, and DNA fragments were excised and subcloned into pBluescript II vector (Stratagene). Subclones were characterized by sequencing. Total RNA was prepared from the cultured CHO cells using an RNA extraction kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and poly(A)+ RNA was purified with oligo(dT)-latex (Oligotex dT30, Hoffmann-La Roche). Synthesis of cDNA and ligation of the cDNA to EcoRI-digested λgt11 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were carried out using a TimeSaver cDNA synthesis kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Random oligonucleotide primers and oligo(dT) were used for the reverse transcriptase reaction. The ligated DNA was packaged in vitro using Gigapack II packaging extract (Stratagene). The library was used for cDNA screening without further amplification. Approximately 8 × 105 plaques from the CHO cell cDNA library were screened using the above PCR product as a probe. Hybond N+nylon membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) replicas of the plaques from the λgt11 cDNA library were fixed by the alkali fixation method recommended by the manufacturer and prehybridized in a solution containing 50% formamide, 5× SSPE (SSPE = sodium chloride/sodium phosphate/EDTA buffer), 5× Denhardt's solution, 0.5% SDS, and 0.05 mg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA for 3 h at 42 °C. Hybridization was carried out at 42 °C in the same buffer containing32P-labeled probe for 16 h. One positive clone was detected by autoradiography, and the inserted cDNA was subcloned into pBluescript by EcoRI digestion. Approximately 8 × 105 plaques from the human fetal brain cDNA library (CLONTECH) were screened using the above inserted cDNA as a probe under the same conditions used for screening the CHO cell cDNA library. Positive clones were detected by autoradiography. The subcloned DNAs were sequenced on both strands by the dideoxy chain termination method usingTaq polymerase (dye terminator cycle sequencing; Perkin-Elmer) with a DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems 373A) and using deaza-GTP kits with Sequenase Version 2.0 (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). The DNA sequences thus obtained were compiled and analyzed using GENETYX-MAX computer programs (Software Development Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). For the construction of pFLAG-CMV-2hHS6ST, the PCR product containing the open reading frame of 1206 base pairs from positions 139 to 1344 was prepared using ATGGTTGAGCGCGCCAGCAAG for the 5′-primer and TACCACTTCTCAATGATGTG for the 3′-primer and was ligated into the bluntedHindIII/EcoRI site of the pFLAG-CMV-2 expression vector (Eastman Kodak Co.). The direction of the inserted cDNA was determined by restriction mapping. COS-7 cells (5 × 105) precultured for 48 h in a 60-mm culture dish were transfected with 4 μg of pFLAG-CMV-2hHS6ST or pFLAG-CMV-2 alone. The transfection was performed using the DEAE-dextran method (45Aruffo A. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingstone R.E. Moore D.D. Seidmann J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Green Publishing Associates/Wiley-Interscience, New York1991: 13.1-16.13.7Google Scholar). After incubation in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics for 72 h, the spent medium was collected, and the cell layers (1.5 × 106 cells) were washed with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium alone, scraped, and homogenized in 1.5 ml of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 0.5% (w/v) Triton X-100, 0.15 m NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, and 2 mm CaCl2. The homogenates were stirred for 1 h and then centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 30 min. FLAG fusion proteins in the supernatant (cell extract) and the spent medium were isolated, respectively, by anti-FLAG M2 (Kodak) affinity chromatography according to the method described by the manufacturer. The activities of HS6ST and HS2ST in the supernatant (cell extract), in the spent medium, and in the anti-FLAG affinity-bound fractions were measured as described previously (35Habuchi H. Habuchi O.

There was no significant difference in the total cell numbers and protein concentrations among the transfectants under the transfection conditions used. Poly(A)+ RNA samples (5 μg) prepared from cultured CHO cells and human fetal brain (CLONTECH) were denatured, electrophoresed on 1% agarose gel containing 6% formaldehyde, and transferred to a Hybond N+ nylon membrane. These membranes were prehybridized in a solution containing 50% formamide, 5× SSPE, 5× Denhardt's solution, 0.5% SDS, and 100 μg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA at 42 °C for 3 h and then were hybridized in the same solution containing32P-labeled probes (1 × 106 cpm/ml) at 42 °C for 16 h. The probes used were a 1343-base fragment at positions 88–1430 and a 710-base fragment for Northern analysis of human tissues and CHO cells, respectively, and human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA, which were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP by random oligonucleotide priming (Ready-to-Go DNA labeling kit, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The membranes were washed twice with 1× SSPE and 0.1% SDS at 50 °C and subsequently with 0.1× SSPE and 0.1% SDS at 50 °C and then subjected to a FUJIX BAS-2000 II bioimaging analyzer (Fuji Photo Film Co.). HS6ST purified from the serum-free culture medium of CHO cells was immobilized on a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane after SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The amino-terminal amino acid sequence of the 45-kDa protein was identical to that of the 52-kDa protein as far as the identification was possible (Table I). We also analyzed the internal amino acid sequence of the 45-kDa protein. The protein prepared by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was immobilized on a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and digested sequentially with endoproteinase Lys-C and then endoproteinase Asp-N followed by trypsin. The digests were separated on a reverse-phase column by HPLC and analyzed with a protein sequencer. Sequence was determined from five different peptides (Table I).Table IAmino acid sequences of HS6ST secreted from CHO cells and its peptides derived from in situ protease digestionSamplesAmino acid sequenceIntact HS6ST (45-kDa protein)(L/Y)P G P X L X L G A P X X R A PIntact HS6ST (52-kDa protein)X P G P X L X L G A PPeptide 1 YX F P V R E LPeptide 2 E T W L FPeptide 3 H L V Q NPeptide 4 D P A G L RPeptide 5 D C P Y N L A Open table in a new tab Based on the amino acid sequences of peptides 2 and 5, sense and antisense primers were designed as shown in Fig. 1 A (sense primers 2s and 5s and antisense primers 2a and 5a). When primers 2s and 5a were used in a PCR with the first strand cDNA of CHO cell poly(A)+ RNA as a template, a major PCR product of 330 base pairs was obtained only in the presence of both primers (Fig. 1 B). When the 330-base pair PCR product was subcloned and sequenced, it contained the nucleotide sequences encoding peptide 4 in addition to those extended from peptides 2 and 5 used as primers. The 330-base pair PCR product was used as a probe to screen the CHO cell cDNA library. We obtained only one positive clone containing the 0.7-kilobase insert after several screenings. Nucleotide sequence analysis indicated that the clone contained 710 nucleotides and encoded a polypeptide composed of 236 amino acid residues (Fig. 2). The predicted amino acid sequence contained a partial N-terminal amino acid sequence of the purified HS6ST and all four internal peptides obtained by endoproteinase digestion of the enzyme (Fig. 2,underlined). However, this clone (clone CHO-HS6ST-3) did not cover all of the open reading frame. The EcoRI fragment from the clone CHO-HS6ST-3 was used as a probe for screening the human fetal brain cDNA library. Seventeen positive clones were obtained from 8 × 105 plaques. Seven independent clones were isolated and subcloned into pBluescript II KS. The nucleotide sequence determined from two overlapping clones (1.7 and 2.0 kilobases) encoded the entire open reading frame of human HS6ST as shown in Fig. 3 A. The amino-terminal sequence contains two in-frame ATG codons. According to the consensus eukaryotic translation initiation sequence (46Kozak M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 229-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (2810) Google Scholar), the second ATG codon, but not the first one, appeared to possess the preferred nucleotides in the crucial positions for a translation initiation site. A single open reading frame beginning at the second ATG codon predicts a protein of 401 amino acid residues with a molecular mass of 47,075 Da and two potential N-linked glycosylation sites. To determine the location of the transmembrane domain, if any, a hydropathy plot was generated from the translated sequence. Analysis of the plot revealed one prominent hydrophobic segment in the amino-terminal region, 15 residues in length, that extends from amino acid residues 8 to 22 (Fig. 3 B). The amino acid sequence predicted from the human HS6ST cDNA showed 97% identity to the sequence of the hamster HS6ST cDNA as far as the available sequence data were compared. The amino acid sequence near the carboxyl-terminal end of the transmembrane domain, which started at amino acid residue 25 (see trianglein Fig. 3 A), was almost identical to the amino-terminal sequence of HS6ST purified from the culture medium of CHO cells (see Table I). If the protein were truncated at this site near the transmembrane domain, the molecular mass of the product would be calculated as 44,389 Da, which matches the molecular mass of the CHO-HS6ST protein formed after N-glycanase digestion. To demonstrate that the isolated cDNA encodes heparan-sulfate 6-sulfotransferase, COS-7 cells were transfected with pFLAG-CMV-2hHS6ST, a recombinant plasmid containing the isolated cDNA in the mammalian expression vector pFLAG-CMV-2, or with the vector alone as a control. The HS6ST activity in the cell extract prepared from the transfectants was increased 7.5-fold over the control, but there was no increase in the HS2ST activity in the transfectants compared with the control (TableII). When the cell extract from the transfectants was purified on the anti-FLAG antibody column, the HS6ST activity alone was recovered in the affinity-purified fraction. The HS2ST activity contained in the cell extract was completely removed by this chromatography (Table II). The results clearly indicate that the isolated cDNA encodes a protein for HS6ST. Since HS6ST was found to be secreted from CHO cells to the culture medium (35Habuchi H. Habuchi O. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4172-4179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), we also examined if the HS6ST activity in the transfectants was secreted to the culture medium. The HS6ST activity in the culture medium of the transfectants was increased 3.7-fold over the control. However, when the medium fraction was applied to the anti-FLAG antibody column, no activity was recovered in the affinity-purified fraction (Table II). The loss of FLAG sequence from the recombinant HS6ST might have happened during the secretion.Table IIOverexpression of heparan-sulfate 6-sulfotransferase in COS-7 cellsPlasmidSulfotransferase activityHS6STHS2STpmol/min/1.5 × 106 cellsCell extract pFLAG-CMV-21.9 ± 0.23.8 ± 0.2 pFLAG-CMV-2hHS6ST14.1 ± 0.43.1 ± 0.2FLAG affinity fraction of cell extract pFLAG-CMV-2<0.1<0.1 pFLAG-CMV-2hHS6ST3.1 ± 0.2<0.1Spent medium pFLAG-CMV-213.2 ± 0.31.7 ± 0.2 pFLAG-CMV-2hHS6ST49.3 ± 0.12.9 ± 0.5FLAG affinity fraction of spent medium pFLAG-CMV-2ND2-2001ND, not determined.ND pFLAG-CMV-2hHS6ST<0.1<0.12-2001 ND, not determined. Open table in a new tab When a poly(A)+ RNA sample was prepared from the cultured CHO cells and hybridized with a radioactive probe prepared from an EcoRI fragment of the clone CHO-HS6ST-3, a single transcript of 3.9 kilobases was observed (Fig. 4, lane 1). When a poly(A)+ RNA sample from human fetal brain was hybridized with the radioactive probe prepared from the open reading frame of human HS6ST cDNA, a single transcript of the identical size was also detected (Fig. 4, lane 2). The following lines of evidence suggest that the cloned cDNA encodes a human homologue of the hamster HS6ST protein that we previously purified from CHO cell culture medium (35Habuchi H. Habuchi O. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4172-4179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The polypeptide encoded by the hamster cDNA fragment contained all of the partial amino acid sequences obtained from the purified hamster HS6ST. The human cDNA clones obtained by cross-hybridization with the above hamster cDNA fragment encoded the protein that contained a segment with 97.4% amino acid sequence identity to the polypeptide encoded by the hamster cDNA fragment. When the human cDNA was introduced into a eukaryotic expression system, a preferential increase in the HS6ST activity was observed without any significant change in the HS2ST activity. In addition, the HS6ST activity alone was found to be associated with the fusion protein after the anti-FLAG affinity purification. The enzyme properties of the purified fusion protein were the same as those of the purified Chinese hamster HS6ST protein that we reported previously (35Habuchi H. Habuchi O. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4172-4179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) (for instance, the inhibitory effect of dithiothreitol and the number of and sites for N-linked glycosylation) (data not shown). Two in-frame ATG codons were found in the amino-terminal sequence of the human HS6ST cDNA, but only the sequence around the second ATG codon matched the consensus eukaryotic translation initiation sequence (46Kozak M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 229-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (2810) Google Scholar, 47Kozak M. Cell. 1986; 44: 283-292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3596) Google Scholar). However, the possibility that the first ATG codon might function as the initiation codon could not be ruled out because Kozak's rule does not explain all eukaryotic translation sequences and there are a few exceptions such as some hormones or lymphokines (48Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8125-8132Crossref PubMed Scopus (4170) Google Scholar). The predicted amino acid sequence of human HS6ST showed no significant homology to that of any other sulfotransferase (38Hashimoto Y. Orellana A. Gil G. Hirschberg C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15744-15750Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 39Orellana A. Hirschberg C.B. Wei Z. Swiedler S.J. Ishihara M. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 13980-13985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). It contained neither the sequence of the putative 3′-phosphoadenosine 5′-phosphosulfate-binding site found in arylsulfotransferase IV, LEKCGR (51Zheng Y. Bergold A. Duffel M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30313-30319Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), nor the so-called “P-loop,” GXXGXXK(R) (52Weinshilboum R.W. Otterness D.M. Aksoy I.A. Wood T.C. Her C.H. Raftoglanis R.B. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 3-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar), which is found in most sulfotransferases and thought to be a possible ATP- or GTP-binding site. Thus, human HS6ST may have a tertiary structure for the 3′-phosphoadenosine 5′-phosphosulfate-binding site that is constructed from the amino acid sequence distinct from those of other sulfotransferases. The hydropathy plot (Fig. 3 B) suggests that human HS6ST has a hydrophobic domain at the amino-terminal region and belongs to type II membrane protein. Since the amino acid sequence near the carboxyl-terminal end of the transmembrane domain was almost identical to the amino-terminal sequence of hamster HS6ST purified from the culture medium, the purified HS6ST might have been released from the CHO cells after proteolytic cleavage at the putative site near the transmembrane domain. The proteolytic cleavage was also suggested in the secretion of chondroitin 6-sulfotransferase from chick chondrocytes (49Fukuta M. Uchimura K. Nakashima K. Kato M. Kimata K. Shinomura T. Habuchi O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18575-18580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The secretion of HS6ST may occur not only in cultured cells, but also in tissues in vivo since the HS6ST activity was found in the serum collected from adult mice. As observed in the cultured CHO cells, the serum contained little, if any, HS2ST activity. 2H. Habuchi and K. Kimata, unpublished observations. Northern analysis showed only one transcript of 3.9 kilobases in poly(A)+ RNA samples prepared from both cultured CHO cells and human fetal brain (Fig. 4). Since the purified preparation of hamster HS6ST gave two protein bands of different sizes (52 and 45 kDa) that have the identical N-terminal amino acid sequence (Table I), it is likely that, in addition to the proteolytic cleavage described above, further post-translational modification or processing may be involved in the synthesis and secretion of HS6ST. In contrast to HS6ST, multiple transcripts of different sizes are observed in other sulfotransferases (38Hashimoto Y. Orellana A. Gil G. Hirschberg C.B. J. Biol.

Genomics. 1995; 26: 239-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). However, as far as investigated, they have the same open reading frame, and the differences are detected only in the size and sequence of the untranslated region (52Weinshilboum R.W. Otterness D.M.

Genomics. 1995; 26: 239-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Together with our previous study on the HS2ST cDNA (41Kobayashi M. Habuchi H. Yoneda M. Habuchi O. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13980-13985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), this study suggests that HS6ST and HS2ST may be products from two different and independent transcripts because they are encoded by the different cDNAs without any common sequence and the sizes of their transcripts were different from each other (5.0 and 3.0 kilobases for HS2ST and 3.9 kilobases for HS6ST). The above possibility is also supported by the report of Bai and Esko (21Bai X. Esko J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17711-17717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) on a mutant CHO cell line that is defective only in heparan sulfate 2-O-sulfation. It has been shown recently that the defect in the mutant cell line was recovered by the transfection of our HS2ST cDNA into the cells (55Bai X. Bame K.J. Habuchi H. Kimata K. Esko J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23172-23179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). However, the ongoing genomic analyses will give the definitive answer. Studies on sulfotransferases involved in heparin biosynthesis of mastocytoma tissue have suggested that the 2- and 6-O-sulfotransferase activities may share a common subunit or reside in a single protein (34Wlad H. Maccarana M. Eriksson I. Kjellen L. Lindahl U. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24538-24541Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Considering these observations together, it is likely that several different kinds ofO-sulfotransferases with different specificities may be involved in the 6- and 2-O-sulfation processes of heparan sulfate and heparin as observed in the cases ofN-deacetylation/N-sulfation (32Brandan E.

https://openalex.org/W1992207607,"We report the cloning of a novel human activator of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 7 (MKK7). The mRNA for MKK7 is widely expressed in humans and mice and encodes a 47-kDa protein (419 amino acids), as determined by immunoblotting endogenous MKK7 with an antibody raised against its N terminus. The kinase domain of MKK7 is closely related to aDrosophila JNK kinase dHep (69% identity) and to a newly identified ortholog from Caenorhabditis elegans (54% identity), and was more distantly related to MKK4, MKK3, and MKK6. MKK7 phosphorylated and activated JNK1 but failed to activate p38 MAPK in co-expression studies. In hematopoietic cells, endogenous MKK7 was activated by treatment with the growth factor interleukin-3 (but not interleukin-4), or by ligation of CD40, the B-cell antigen receptor, or the receptor for the Fc fragment of immunoglobulin. MKK7 was also activated when cells were exposed to heat, UV irradiation, anisomycin, hyperosmolarity or the pro-inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-α. Co-expression of constitutively active mutants of RAS, RAC, or CDC42 in HeLa epithelial cells or of RAC or CDC42 in Ba/F3 factor-dependent hematopoietic cells also activated MKK7, suggesting that MKK7 will be involved in many physiological pathways.

The generation of embryonic stem (ES) cells in which the mkk4gene was disrupted provided conclusive evidence for the existence of another JNK kinase, as ES cells lacking MKK4 still exhibited increased JNK activity following treatment with hyperosmolarity or UV irradiation (24Yang D.

The mRNA for MKK7 was widely expressed and encodes a 419-amino acid protein that is most highly related to the Drosophila MKK known as dHep (26Glise B. Bourbon H. Noselli S. Cell. 1995; 83: 451-461Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). MKK7 was capable of phosphorylating and activating JNK1 both in vivo and in vitro but was unable to activate p38 MAPKin vivo. MKK7 was activated in response to the hematopoietic growth factor interleukin-3 (IL-3) or ligation of three receptors involved in immune regulation as follows: CD40, the receptor for the Fc fragment of immunoglobulin G (FcR), or the B-cell antigen receptor (BCR), as well as by stresses such as hyperosmolarity, heat shock, UV irradiation, anisomycin, or the pro-inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). Co-expression of MKK7 with constitutively active mutants of the small GTPases RAS, RAC, or CDC42 indicated that MKK7 was downstream of RAS, RAC, or CDC42 in HeLa cells and downstream of RAC or CDC42 in Ba/F3 cells.DISCUSSIONOur results indicate that human and murine MKK7 are highly conserved (99% identity) and are most closely related to dHep, a MKK in Drosophila, exhibiting 69% identity in the kinase domain. MKK7 was less related to MKK4, MKK6, or MKK3 (∼45–55% identity), the other mammalian MKK known to be activators of JNK and p38 MAPK, and was even less similar to MEK1 or MEK2 (∼30–35% identity), the activators of ERK MAPK (Fig. 1 B). We conducted extensive searches of the yeast and invertebrate data bases, and although we failed to identify MKK7 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we did identify a highly related C. elegansMKK (cMKK7) that exhibited 54% identity to MKK7 within the kinase domain (28Wilson R. et al.Nature. 1994; 368: 32-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (1439) Google Scholar). A more detailed inspection of alignments revealed a series of residues or motifs that were conserved among dHep, MKK7, and cMKK7 that were not present in MKK3, MKK4, and MKK6, and vice versa. Particularly striking are differences in the activation loops, with MKK7, dHep, and cMKK7 being characterized by a basic amino acid (S(K/R)AKT), at the same position where in MKK3, MKK4, and MKK6 a hydrophobic residue (S(I/V)AKT) is found. Overall these patterns of conservation of specific motifs support the notion that MKK7 is orthologous with dHep and cMKK7 and is more distantly related to MKK4, MKK3, and MKK6 (Fig. 1 B). It will be interesting to determine the functional significance of the conserved residues that characterize MKK7, dHep, and cMKK7 and distinguish them from MKK4, MKK3, and MKK6.Tournier et al. (32Tournier C. Whitmarsh A.J. Cavanagh J. Barrett T. Davis R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The amino acid sequence predicted from their murine MKK7a clone is identical to the sequence that we report here, with the exception that it lacks the N terminus that was present in all of our predicted human and murine MKK7 splice variants. We were able to immunoblot endogenous MKK7 in lysates of Ba/F3 hematopoietic cells and MC/9 mast cells using an antiserum raised against the N terminus of our human and murine MKK7 sequence (Fig. 2 A), and therefore we are confident that the form of MKK7 predicted from our human and murine cDNA is indeed expressed in murine cells.Since submission of this manuscript there have been a number of articles describing the cloning of MKK7 (33Holland P.M.

Moriguchi et al. (34Moriguchi T. Toyoshima F. Masuyama N. Hanafusa H. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7045-7053Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have cloned murine MKK7γ and identified two MKK7 isoforms using an antiserum raised against full-length murine MKK7γ. Based on electrophoretic mobility, we believe the larger isoform could represent the murine equivalent of our human MKK7β (Fig. 1 A). Lu et al. (35Lu X. Nemoto S. Lin A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24751-24754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) have identified another isoform of human MKK7 that has the same N terminus and kinase domain as our MKK7 isoforms but contains 70 amino acids that are unique to any of the MKK7 isoforms reported to date.Based on sequence identities between the known MKK (Fig. 1 B), we investigated the ability of MKK7 to activate JNK or p38 MAPK and showed that in co-transfection assays MKK7 acted upstream of JNK1 (Fig. 3 A) but not p38 MAPK (Fig. 3 B). The identification of JNK1 as an in vitro substrate for MKK7 permitted us to investigate the ability of a range of stimuli to activate transiently expressed MKK7. In HeLa cells, MKK7 was strongly activated by hyperosmotic shock, UV light, anisomycin, heat shock, and to a lesser extent TNF-α (Fig. 4, A and B). We observed no detectable activation of MKK7 in HeLa cells treated with EGF (Fig. 4 A). These results are similar to that seen by Holland et al. (33Holland P.M. Suzanne M. Campbell J.S. Noselli S. Cooper J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24994-24998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) with platelet-derived growth factor in NIH3T3 cells. In Ba/F3 hematopoietic cells, hyperosmotic shock and UV light also activated MKK7 (Fig. 4 C). Our observations that stimulation of Ba/F3 cells with IL-3 increased the activity of MKK7 (Figs. 4 C and 5 C) correlate with recent observations that JNK was activated by a range of hematopoietic growth factors including IL-3, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, G-CSF, erythropoietin or Steel locus factor (10Foltz I.N.

Moreover our observation that IL-4 failed to activate MKK7 (Figs. 4 C and 5 C) correlates with the inability of IL-4 to activate the RAS, ERK, p38, or JNK MAP kinase pathways in hematopoietic cells (3Welham M.J.

This is consistent with previous work that demonstrated that the RAS and RHO family of small GTPases are capable of activating JNK (6Dérijard B. Hibi M. Wu I. Barrett T. Su B. Deng T. Karin M.

Chem. 1995; 270: 27995-27998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). Slightly different results were obtained in Ba/F3 cells where MKK7 was activated by co-expression of activated RAC or CDC42 but not RAS (Fig. 6 B). The inability of RAS to activate MKK7 was not surprising as a constitutively active RAS was insufficient to activate JNK in Ba/F3 cells (11Terada K. Kaziro Y. Satoh T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4544-4548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), although IL-3-induced JNK activation was blocked by expression of a dominant-negative mutant of RAS (11Terada K. Kaziro Y. Satoh T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4544-4548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results support the notion that RAS is necessary but not sufficient for JNK activation. Our evidence that IL-3 increased MKK7 activity (Figs.4 C and 5 C), but that RAS alone failed to increase MKK7 activity (Fig. 6 B), is also consistent with data on activation of JNK by G-CSF, which is structurally related to IL-3 and acts through a similar receptor. These experiments showed that activation of JNK in cells stimulated with G-CSF depended upon both an intact RAS signaling pathway as well as a specific tyrosine residue in the G-CSF receptor (13Rausch O. Marshall C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1170-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Together these data suggest that activation of MKK7 in response to IL-3 involves both activation of the RAS pathway and an as yet unknown signal.Depending on differentiation of the B lymphocyte and the presence of co-stimulatory molecules such as CD40, signaling through the BCR can initiate signals for either growth and survival or death of the B lymphocyte (41DeFranco A.L. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1997; 9: 296-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown the BCR to be a weak activator of JNK (16Sutherland C.L. Heath A.W. Pelech S.L. Young P.R. Gold M.R. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 3381-3390PubMed Google Scholar). We observed that ligation of the μ-chain of the BCR on WEHI-231 cells induced weak, but reproducible, activation of MKK7 (Fig. 5 D), consistent with the activation of JNK we observed after ligation of the BCR (data not shown).The receptor for the Fc fragment of immunoglobulin G (FcR) is structurally related to the BCR and has many important roles in the immune system (42Takai T. Int. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 13: 369-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). These include the phagocytosis of Ig-coated particles by macrophages and neutrophils, the antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity by NK cells, the down-regulation of signaling through the BCR, and the release of TNF-α and other mediators by macrophages and mast cells. Our observation that ligation of FcR results in the activation of both endogenous MKK4 and MKK7 in MC/9 mast cells (Fig. 5 E) supports previous findings that signaling through the FcR activates JNK in bone marrow-derived macrophages (17Rose D.M. Winston B.W. Chan E.D. Riches D.W.H. Gerwins P. Johnson G.L. Henson P.M. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 3433-3438PubMed Google Scholar). Recent studies have shown that signaling through the JNK pathway is required for the production of TNF-α in MC/9 mast cells (43Ishizuka T. Terada N. Gerwins P. Hamelmann E. Oshiba A. Fanger G.R. Johnson G.L. Gelfand E.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6358-6363Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). As signaling through the FcR activates JNK through MKK4 and MKK7, it will be important to determine their individual roles in the production of TNF-α in mast cells.CD40 is a member of the TNF receptor family, and ligation of CD40 has been reported to activate JNK in B-cells (15Berberich I. Shu G. Siebelt F. Woodgett J.R. Kyriakis J.M. Clark E.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 92-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 16Sutherland C.L. Heath A.W. Pelech S.L. Young P.R. Gold M.R. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 3381-3390PubMed Google Scholar). Signaling through CD40 is critical for the growth, differentiation, and class switching of B lymphocytes (44Foy T.M. Aruffo A. Bajorath J. Buhlmann J.E. Noelle R.J. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 591-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar), and the development of the Th1 subset of T lymphocytes through the activation of macrophages and dendritic cells (45Grewal I.S. Foellmer H.G. Grewal K.D. Xu J. Hardardottir F. Baron J.L. Janeway C.A. Flavell R.A. Science. 1996; 273: 1864-1867Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). Our findings that ligation of CD40 activated both endogenous MKK4 and MKK7 (Fig. 5 D) is consistent with our findings on the activation of endogenous MKK4 and MKK7 in HeLa cells treated with TNF-α (Fig. 5 B). MKK7 has also been reported to be activated by ligation of Fas, another member of the TNF receptor family (46Toyoshima F. Moriguchi T. Nishida E. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1005-1015Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Together these findings suggest that activation of MKK7 may be a common feature of signals activated by ligation of members of the TNF receptor family. Recent reports have shown that the genetic disruption of mkk4 in B lymphocytes failed to affect their growth or their ability to undergo class switching (47Nishina H. Bachmann M. Oliveira-dos-Santos A.J. Kozieradzki I. Fischer K.D. Odermatt B. Wakeham A. Shahinian A. Takimoto H. Bernstein A. Mak T.W. Woodgett J.R. Ohashi P.S. Penninger J.M. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 941-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). It will be interesting to determine the role of MKK7 in the physiological regulation of the immune system via signaling through the BCR, the FcR, or CD40.The existence of multiple activators of JNK responsive to different stimuli was established by the fact that MKK4-deficient ES cells still exhibited activation of JNK in response to hyperosmolarity and UV light but not heat shock or anisomycin (19Lin A. Minden A. Martinetto H. Claret F. Lange-Carter C. Mercurio F. Johnson G.L. Karin M. Science. 1995; 268: 286-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar, 20Dérijard B. Raingeaud J. Barrett T. Wu I. Han J. Ulevitch R.J. Davis R.J. Science. 1995; 267: 682-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (1405) Google Scholar). In that MKK7 is activated by all of the above stimuli (Figs. 4 and 5), and MKK7 mRNA is present in ES cells (Table I), the failure of MKK4-deficient ES cells to activate JNK in response to heat shock or anisomycin is paradoxical. It is possible that, although MKK7 is expressed in ES cells, it is not activated by heat or anisomycin because of cell-specific differences in upstream activators. This notion is supported by a recent report that in KB and U937 cells TNF-α activates MKK7 but not MKK4 (34Moriguchi T. Toyoshima F. Masuyama N. Hanafusa H. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7045-7053Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 37Lawler S. Cuenda A. Goedert M. Cohen P. FEBS Lett. 1997; 414: 153-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), whereas in HeLa cells we observed that TNF-α activates both MKK7 and MKK4 (Fig. 5 B), an observation recently reported by Wuet al. (36Wu Z. Wu J. Jacinto E. Karin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 7407-7416Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). MKK4 has also been recently reported to be activated in normal bone marrow-derived macrophages treated with TNF-α, supporting the notion that these kinases will be regulated differently depending on their cellular context (48Winston B.W. Chan E.D. Johnson G.L. Riches D.W.H. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 4491-4497PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, Wuet al. (36Wu Z. Wu J. Jacinto E. Karin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 7407-7416Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) have reported that ASK1 and GCK activate MKK7 in preference to MKK4, whereas MEKK1 and MEKK2 activate both MKK4 and MKK7 to comparable levels.The functional significance of the activation of MKK7 is unclear, but its activation by physiological stimuli such as IL-3 (Figs.4 C and 5 C), by ligation of immunoregulators such as CD40 (Fig. 5 D), BCR (Fig. 5 D), FcR (Fig. 5 E), CD3 (36Wu Z. Wu J. Jacinto E. Karin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 7407-7416Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), 2M. Luckach and R. Salmon, unpublished observations. or by the GTPases RAS, RAC, and CDC42 (Fig. 6) suggest that the role of MKK7 will not be confined to stress responses. The existence of an ortholog of MKK7 in C. elegans and our failure to identify an ortholog in S. cerevisiae suggest that MKK7 arose in evolution during the transition from single cellular to multicellular organisms. The notion that MKK7 is involved in processes important for multicellular organisms such embryonic development, chemotaxis, or apoptosis is in keeping with evidence that mutations in dHep and Bsk, the Drosophila homolog of JNK1, result in a similar failure of epithelial cell movement and dorsal closure (26Glise B. Bourbon H. Noselli S. Cell. 1995; 83: 451-461Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 49Sluss H.K. Han Z. Barrett T. Davis R.J. Ip T.

Chem. 1997; 272: 24994-24998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that MKK7 is able to partially complement a deficiency of dHep in Drosophila. This demonstrates that MKK7 is highly conserved functionally and suggests that it may play a role in embryological development in mammals. The embryonic lethality resulting from disruption of the mkk4gene in mice also points to the importance of normal JNK signaling during embryonic development (24Yang D. Tournier C. Wysk M. Lu H.-T.

Future work detailing the function of individual activators of JNK is likely to reveal roles in multiple aspects of development and other physiological processes, including hematopoiesis and immune responses. The responses of eukaryotic cells to extracellular stimuli are remarkably well conserved in evolution. In mammalian cells most extracellular stimuli result in the activation of three families of Ser/Thr protein kinases, the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) 1The abbreviations used are: MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; IL, interleukin; TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor-α; FcR, Fc receptor for IgG; BCR, B-cell antigen rece"
https://openalex.org/W2023638809,"Interleukin-9 (IL-9) is a cytokine with pleiotropic effects on mast cell and T cell lines. It exerts its effects through the IL-9R complex consisting of IL-9Rα and the common γc subunit. Here we report functional evidence for receptor heteromerization for efficient signal transduction, and we define minimal requirements in the two receptor subunits for IL-9R function. Tyrosine 336 of the IL-9Rα and the membrane-proximal segment of γc are both crucial for signaling. The activated IL-9R complex employs the Janus kinases JAK1 and JAK3 for subsequent activation of the signal transducer and activator transcription (STAT) factors STAT-1, STAT-3, and STAT-5. This process is independent of Tyk2. We demonstrate further that the activated STAT complexes consist of STAT-1 and STAT-5 homodimers and STAT-1-STAT-3 heterodimers. Finally, we show that IL-9R signaling in a T cell line does not result in detectable mitogen-activated protein kinase activation and leads to unsustained proliferation. Nonetheless, these T cells are efficiently protected from dexamethasone-induced apoptosis.

(1Renauld J.C. Kermouni A. Vink A. Louahed J. Van Snick J. J. Leukoc. Biol. 1995; 57: 353-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar)). It is a major factor for mast cell differentiation, but its activity on T cells is less well characterized. It was shown to induce granzyme A and B expression in T cell lines (2Louahed J. Kermouni A. Van Snick J. Renauld J.-C. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 5061-5070PubMed Google Scholar). IL-9 is not mitogenic for freshly isolated T cells, but it is active on preactivated T cells and T cell lines (3Uyttenhove C. Simpson R.J. Van Snick J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 6934-6938Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). In addition, IL-9 stimulates in vitro growth of T cell lymphomas (4Vink A. Renauld J.-C. Warnier G. Van Snick J. Eur. J. Immunol. 1993; 23: 1134-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), and IL-9 transgenic mice show increased occurrence of thymic lymphomas (5Renauld J.-C. van der Lugt N. Vink A. van Room M. Godfraind C. Warnier G. Merz H. Feller A. Berns A. Van Snick J. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1327-1332PubMed Google Scholar). In humans, dysregulated IL-9 expression has been found in patients with Hodgkin's disease (6Merz H. Houssiau F. Orscheschek K. Renauld J.-C. Fliedner A. Herin M. Noel H. Kadin M. Mueller-Hermelink K.H. Van Snick J. Feller A.C.

Brach M.A. Drexler H.G. Bross K.J. Herrman F. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 1026-1031PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been shown that IL-9 can protect thymic lymphoma cells and T cell lines from dexamethasone-induced apoptosis (8Renauld J.-C. Vink A. Louahed J. Van Snick J. Blood. 1995; 5: 1300-1305Crossref Google Scholar, 9Louahed J. Renauld J.-C. Demoulin J.-B. Baughman G. Bourgeois S. Sugamura K. Van Snick J. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 3704-3710PubMed Google Scholar). These data together suggest a possible role for IL-9 in tumorigenesis. IL-9 exerts its effects through the functional IL-9R complex, consisting of IL-9Rα (10Renauld J.-C. Druez C. Kermouni A.

The γc subunit is also utilized in the receptor complexes for IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, and IL-15 (11Kondo M. Takeshita T. Ishii N. Nakamura M. Watanabe S. Arai K.-I. Sugamura K.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3654-3663Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). Both IL-9Rα and γc are members of the hematopoietin receptor superfamily (15Idzerda R.L. March C.J. Mosley B. Lyman S.D. Vanden Bos T. Gimpel S.D. Din W.S. Grabstein K.H. Widmer M.B. Park L.S. Cosman D. Beckmann M.P. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 171: 861-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar), which share several common motifs, including four canonically spaced cysteine residues and the WSXWS motif in the extracellular domain, and the Box1 and Box2 motifs in the intracellular domain. The IL-9Rα was shown previously to associate with γc in the presence of IL-9 (16Russell S.M. Johnston J.A. Noguchi M. Kawamura M. Bacon C.M. Friedmann M. Berg M. McVicar D.W. Witthuhn B.A. Silvennoinen O. Goldman A.S. Schmalstieg F.C. Ihle J.N. O'Shea J.J. Leonard W.J. Science. 1994; 266: 1042-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar), and evidence for functional interaction of the two receptor chains was derived from studies in which anti-γc antibody treatment abolished IL-9R signaling (17Kimura Y. Takeshita T. Kondo M. Ishii N. Nakamura M. Van Snick J. Sugamura K. Int. Immunol. 1995; 7: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Although neither receptor chain has any intrinsic kinase activity, rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of both receptor chains and cellular substrates occurs after receptor engagement. This step is thought to be mediated by the nonreceptor protein tyrosine kinases of the Janus kinase (JAK) family, which are preassociated with the receptor chains (for reviews, see Refs. 18Darnell J.E. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Science. 1994; 264: 1415-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (4912) Google Scholar and 19Schindler C. Darnell J.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 621-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (1636) Google Scholar). Stimulation of the IL-9R was shown to lead to the phosphorylation of JAK1, JAK3, and Tyk2 (20Yin T. Yang L. Yang Y.-C. Blood. 1995; 85: 3101-3106Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It remained unclear, however, which of these kinases are necessary for the generation of the signaling response. Phosphorylated tyrosines of the receptor act as docking sites for STAT proteins (signaltransducer and activator oftranscription), that bind phosphotyrosines via SH2 domains (21Fu X.-Y. Schindler C. Improta T. Aebersold R. Darnell J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7840-7843Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar, 22Schindler C. Shuai K. Prezioso V.R. Darnell J.E. Science. 1992; 257: 809-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar). Once bound, they become tyrosine-phosphorylated, dissociate from the receptor, and form homo- or heterodimers with members of their own family via SH2 domain interactions. These activated transcription factor dimers are capable of translocation into the nucleus to bind to specific DNA elements and initiate transcription of target genes. Several studies have suggested that the STATs involved in IL-9R signaling are STAT-1, STAT-3, and STAT-5 (20Yin T. Yang L. Yang Y.-C. Blood. 1995; 85: 3101-3106Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Yin T. Keller S.R. Quelle F.W. Witthuhn B.A. Tsang M.L.-S. Lienhard G.E. Ihle J.N. Yang Y.-C. J. Biol.

Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4710-4716Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). However, the specific composition of the STAT·DNA complexes remained unclear. The major activity of IL-9 on T cells has been proposed to be protection from apoptosis rather than mitogenesis. This has been demonstrated for thymic lymphoma cell lines (8Renauld J.-C. Vink A. Louahed J. Van Snick J. Blood. 1995; 5: 1300-1305Crossref Google Scholar) and T cell lines (9Louahed J. Renauld J.-C. Demoulin J.-B. Baughman G. Bourgeois S. Sugamura K. Van Snick J. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 3704-3710PubMed Google Scholar). However, no evidence has been obtained regarding the mechanisms underlying this antiapoptotic activity of the activated IL-9R. In the present study chimeric receptors between the erythropoietin (EPO) extracellular domain and the IL-9Rα and γcintracellular domains were created and tested, along with several mutants of these chimeras, in COS-7 cells. The role of JAKs in IL-9R signaling was investigated in the human fibrosarcoma cell lines U4A and U1A that are deficient in JAK1 and JAK3, and JAK3 and Tyk2, respectively. Using these systems, the minimal requirements for IL-9R signaling were defined. Finally, a murine T helper cell line was stably transfected with chimeric receptors, and the effect of receptor stimulation was investigated by assays for STAT-DNA binding, antiapoptotic activity, and proliferation. These data suggest that signaling through the IL-9R blocks dexamethasone-induced activation of components of the cell death machinery, possibly due to activation of the antiapoptotic STAT-3 and STAT-5. The IL-2-dependent murine T helper cell line HT-2 (ATCC) was cultured in RPMI 1640, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 55 μm2-mercaptoethanol, 2 mml-glutamine, and 200 units/ml recombinant human IL-2. Transfections were performed by electroporation (950 μF, 300 V, on a Bio-Rad Genepulser II) using 1 × 107 cells and 20 mg of DNA; stable transfectants were obtained by selection in G418 (1 mg/ml, Life Technologies, Inc.). Clones isolated by limiting dilution were screened by Northern blot analysis to identify cell lines stably expressing the transfected receptor subunit. Stable transfectants expressing two receptor subunits were derived from cells already expressing either EPOγ or EPOγYF; clones were obtained by selection in G418 and hygromycin B (Boehringer Mannheim) and screened by Northern blot analysis. COS-7 monkey kidney cells (ATCC) were routinely cultured in Iscove's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 2 mml-glutamine. Transfections were carried out in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 2 mml-glutamine using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) per the manufacturer's instructions. U4A and U1A human fibrosarcoma cells (a kind gift of Dr. G. Stark) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mml-glutamine, and hygromycin B. Transfections were carried out using the calcium phosphate method (Life Technologies, Inc.). Anti-STAT-3 and anti-STAT-5 antisera were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Anti-STAT-1 monoclonal antibody was obtained from Transduction Laboratories, antiphosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody (4G10) from Upstate Biotechnology. Recombinant murine IL-9 was purchased from Genzyme; recombinant human EPO was a kind gift of Ortho Biotech Inc., and recombinant human IL-2 was a kind gift of the Chiron Corp. All receptor cDNAs were subcloned into the expression vectors pCMV4, pCMV4neo, or pCMV4hygro. Chimeric EPOγ and receptor mutants were generated as described elsewhere (25Goldsmith M.A. Lai S.Y. Xu W. Amaral M.C. Kuczek E.S. Parent L.J. Mills G.B. Tarr K.L. Longmore G.D. Greene W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21729-21737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The EPO9 chimera was constructed in a similar way using a NheI site at the fusion junction between EPOR extracellular domain and the transmembrane region of the human IL-9Rα. The EPO9Y3F mutant was generated using polymerase chain reaction overlap methodology as described previously (25Goldsmith M.A. Lai S.Y. Xu W. Amaral M.C. Kuczek E.S. Parent L.J. Mills G.B. Tarr K.L.

Conventional 72-h [3H]thymidine incorporation assays were performed using triplicate cultures of 5 × 104 cells per sample. Cells were incubated for the indicated time period with the indicated amount of factor. 1 μCi of [3H]thymidine was added for the last 4 h of incubation. Data are expressed as a percentage of [3H]thymidine incorporation of cells treated with 10 nm IL-2. 5–10 × 106 cells were incubated for 24 h in medium without IL-2, or stimulated with 10 nm IL-2, 50 units/ml EPO, or 1 μmdexamethasone (Sigma), respectively. Cells were harvested, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and immediately used for staining. Staining with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated annexin 5 and propidium iodide was performed using the ApoAlert kit (CLONTECH). Samples were analyzed on a Becton Dickinson FACScan. The percentage of dead (annexin 5- and propidium iodine-positive cells) and actively dying cells (annexin 5-positive and propidium iodide-negative) was determined by gating on the intact cell population, excluding cellular debris. 20–40 × 106 cells were rested in serum-free medium containing 1% bovine serum albumin for 4 h and stimulated as described for 10 min (COS-7, U4A, U1A) or 15 min (HT-2). Cells were lysed, and nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously (26Gaffen S.L. Lai S.Y. Xu W. Gouillex F. Groner B. Goldsmith M.A. Greene W.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7192-7196Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). DNA binding studies were performed with 1 × 105 cpm of probe, 3 μg of poly(dI-dC) (Boehringer Mannheim) and the indicated amounts of nuclear extracts on a nondenaturing 5% polyacrylamide gel. The IgG Fc receptor STAT response element (FcγR1) was end-labeled with [γ-32P]dATP (Amersham Corp.) and polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs). Preincubations with different antibodies were performed in the absence of poly(dI-dC) and binding buffer for 45 min on ice prior to initiation of the binding reaction by addition of labeled probe. 10–20 × 106 cells were rested for 6 h and stimulated as described. In vitro MAPK assays were performed using the MAPK assay kit (New England Biolabs). In short, cells were lysed and activated Erk1/Erk2 MAPK was immunoprecipitated using an antiphospho-MAPK antibody. Kinase assays were performed using an Elk1-glutathione S-transferase fusion protein as a substrate with subsequent immunoblotting for phosphorylated Elk1. To evaluate the minimal requirements for efficient signaling in the IL-9R system a chimeric receptor approach was employed in the background of COS-7 cells. Expression plasmids encoding EPO9 (chimeric IL-9Rα subunit containing extracellular domain of EPOR) and EPOγ (chimeric γc chain containing extracellular domain of EPOR) were cotransfected into these cells together with various components of the signaling machinery and STAT activation was investigated. After stimulation with EPO, nuclear extracts were prepared, followed by EMSA with a STAT-specific binding element (FcγR1). DNA binding activity was observed only when both chimeric receptor chains EPO9 and EPOγ were present (Fig. 1 A), and was not detected when either receptor chain alone was present. Thus, signaling through the IL-9R apparently depends on heteromultimerization of the two receptor subunits; based on the structure of EPOR these presumably represent dimers, but higher order multimers may exist. Endogenous JAKs and cotransfected JAK3 were necessary and sufficient for the generation of a signal by this receptor complex. In the absence of cotransfected STAT, a single band corresponding to endogenous STAT-1 (as identified by antibody supershift analysis, data not shown) was present; cotransfection of STAT-5 resulted in a second more slowly migrating band, which was identified as STAT-5 by antibody supershift analysis (data not shown). These data show that EPO9 and EPOγ apparently must form heteromers for efficient signal transduction resulting in STAT binding to DNA. This signaling complex requires JAK3 and is able to activate both STAT-1 and STAT-5. To test which portions of γc are necessary for efficient signaling, several mutants of EPOγ (25Goldsmith M.A. Lai S.Y. Xu W. Amaral M.C. Kuczek E.S. Parent L.J. Mills G.B. Tarr K.L. Longmore G.D. Greene W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21729-21737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) were tested (Fig. 1 B). The EPOγ336 mutant, with C-terminal truncation up to the Box2 region, supported induction of both STAT-1 and STAT-5 bands and thus showed no difference compared with the wild-type chain in the EMSA. Further truncation into the Box1-Box2 (EPOγ294) domain and to the TM region (EPOγTM), or internal deletion of either Box1 or Box2, abolished signaling. Since JAK3 has been proposed to bind to the Box1-Box2 domain of γc, these results likely are explained by the inability of those mutants to bind JAK3. Tyrosine substitution mutants of both receptor chains were tested to elucidate the role of tyrosine residues in the signaling processes (Fig. 1 C). Complete substitution of all tyrosines in the EPOγ chain with phenylalanine (EPOγYF) led to no change in STAT activation. EPO9Y3F was created to verify in this system the recent report that tyrosine 336 of IL-9Rα is important for STAT activation and antiapoptotic signaling (24Demoulin J.-B. Uyttenhove C. Van Roost E. de Lestre B. Donckers D. Van Snick J. Renauld J.-C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4710-4716Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Substitution of tyrosine 336 with phenylalanine (EPO9Y3F) in EPO9 led to the loss of both STAT bands following receptor stimulation (Fig. 1 C). These results indicate that tyrosines of γc are dispensable for signaling by the IL-9R, whereas tyrosine 336 of IL-9Rα is crucial for activation of STAT-1 and STAT-5. To confirm these findings and to clarify further the role of the JAKs in IL-9R function, U4A and U1A cells were employed in a similar reconstitution approach. U4A is a somatic mutant of the human 2FTGH cell line that fails to express JAK3 and JAK1 but contains JAK2 and Tyk2 (27Muller M. Briscoe J. Laxton C. Guschin D. Ziemiecki A. Silvennoinen O. Harpur A.G. Barbieri G. Witthuhn B.A. Schindler C. Pellegrini S. Wilks A.F. Ihle J.N. Stark G.R. Kerr I.M. Nature. 1993; 366: 129-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar). In U4A cells, IL-9-mediated induction of STAT-5 was reconstituted by the simultaneous transfection of IL-9Rα, γc, JAK1, JAK3, and STAT-5 (Fig. 2). No signal was observed when any of these components were omitted from the transfection, indicating that endogenous Tyk2 or JAK2 cannot substitute for JAK1 or JAK3 in this system (Fig. 2). Furthermore, replacement of either wild-type JAK1 or JAK3 with a kinase-inactive mutant that lacks the catalytic lysine (JAK1 K907A or JAK3 K851A, respectively) (28Liu K.D. Gaffen S.L. Goldsmith M.A. Greene W.C. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 817-826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) abolished downstream induction of STAT-5. These findings strongly suggest that the primary kinases required for IL-9R function are JAK1 and JAK3, and that Tyk2 is dispensable for this activity. To establish definitively whether or not Tyk2 contributes to IL-9R function in this system, similar experiments were performed with the U1A somatic mutant (29Velazquez L. Fellous M. Stark G.R. Pellegrini S. Cell. 1992; 70: 313-322Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar) that lacks Tyk2 and JAK3 but retains JAK1 and JAK2. In this cellular context, robust activation of STAT-5 through the IL-9R occurred upon introduction of JAK3 (Fig. 2); Tyk2 evidently was nonessential for this process since these cells lack Tyk2. Transfection with a Tyk2 expression plasmid in place of JAK3 yielded only a very marginal signal (Fig. 2). Therefore, complementary systems (COS, U4A, and U1A) uniformly demonstrated the importance of catalytically active JAK1 and JAK3 and the dispensability of Tyk2 for IL-9R-dependent signaling. The EPO9 and EPOγ/EPOγYF receptor chains were stably transfected into the IL-2-dependent murine T helper cell line HT-2 to investigate IL-9R signaling in a T cell context. After stimulation of stable transfectants with EPO, nuclear extracts were prepared and analyzed by EMSA with the FcγR1 probe. DNA binding activity was detected only in cells expressing both chimeric receptor chains, EPO9 and EPOγ (Fig. 3). The resulting triple band vanished when excess unlabeled oligonucleotide was used as a competitor. STAT activation was sustained over a 60-min stimulation period, and the signal became weaker with prolonged stimulation vanishing after 90 min (data not shown). The tripartite band was also observed in cells transfected with vectors encoding EPO9 and EPOγYF (Fig. 3). To determine further the nature of the observed bands, supershift analysis was performed with antibodies against phosphotyrosine and against STAT-1, STAT-3, and STAT-5 (Fig. 3). Isotype-matched antibodies resulted in no change of pattern. Treatment with antiphosphotyrosine antibodies resulted in a complete loss of all three bands, due to prevention of formation of STAT dimers via SH2 domain-phosphotyrosine interactions. When extracts were treated with anti-STAT-1 antibody, the two lower bands were lost, whereas anti-STAT-3 treatment led to selective loss of the middle band and some diminution of the lower band. Anti-STAT-5 antibody resulted in slower migration of the upper band. The anti-STAT-1 and anti-STAT-3 antibodies presumably are blocking antibodies, preventing either STAT-dimer formation or DNA binding, resulting in loss of the band. In contrast, the anti-STAT-5-antibody apparently binds to the STAT-5·DNA complex, which leads to a slower migration of the band on the gel. These data suggest that the STAT complexes formed upon stimulation of the IL-9R consist of STAT-5 and STAT-1 homodimers (upper and lower bands, respectively), STAT-1-STAT-3 heterodimers (middle band), and possibly STAT-3 homodimers (bottom band). To test whether IL-9R stimulation protected HT-2 cells from glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis, stable cell lines were treated with dexamethasone and evaluated for apoptotic responses by flow cytometry analysis of cells stained with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled annexin 5. HT-2 cells were starved of IL-2 for 24 h and treated with either dexamethasone alone or with dexamethasone and EPO. IL-2 withdrawal, as well as additional dexamethasone treatment, led to the onset of apoptosis after ∼4 h (data not shown), resulting in a massive number of apoptotic cells after 24 h (Fig. 4). Treatment with dexamethasone increased the percentage of dead and dying cells considerably above the level induced by IL-2 withdrawal. Stimulation of the chimeric receptor complex with EPO led to a complete blockade of apoptosis caused by dexamethasone, but had no influence on the degree of apoptosis caused by IL-2 starvation. EPO-mediated inhibition of dexamethasone-dependent apoptosis was not observed in cells expressing a single receptor subunit (EPOγ or EPO9, Fig. 5, A and B, respectively), but only in cells expressing both EPO9 and EPOγ or EPO9 and EPOγYF (Fig. 4, C and D, respectively).Figure 5Induction of proliferation in a T cell line. Proliferative response of stably transfected HT-2 cells after stimulation with the indicated doses of EPO. A, cells expressing only a single receptor subunit did not respond to EPO after 24 h of stimulation. The double transfectants EPOγ/9 and EPOγYF/9 responded to EPO vigorously in a dose-dependent manner. B, the proliferative response of HT-2 EPOγ/9 and HT-2 EPOγYF/9 cells was time-dependent and was not sustained for more than 24 h. Additional dexamethasone treatment completely blocked the proliferative response to EPO (14 units/ml) of these cell lines; the same effects were observed at 10 or 50 units/ml (data not shown). Error bars are the standard error of the mean of triplicate measurements; in some cases these error bars are too small too be depicted.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Since reduction of the percentage of annexin 5-positive cells by treatment with EPO could have been due to an increased overall cell number, the proliferative signal generated by the IL-9R was investigated. HT-2 cells transfected with either EPO9 or EPOγ alone displayed no proliferative response to EPO in the absence of IL-2 as measured by [3H]thymidine incorporation (Fig. 5). Both, EPOγ/9 and EPOγYF/9, however, showed vigorous DNA synthesis after 24 h in a dose-dependent fashion. Nevertheless, this response was not sustained and diminished to background levels after 72 h (Fig. 5). Prolonged cultivation in EPO without IL-2 did not lead to generation of EPO-dependent clones. To test whether the proliferative response after chimeric receptor stimulation with EPO was associated with activation of MAPKs,in vitro kinase assays of immunoprecipitated Erk1/Erk2 MAPK were performed. Unstimulated HT-2 EPOγ/9 cells showed no detectable MAPK activity as shown by Western blotting for in vitrophosphorylated Elk1 substrate (Fig. 6). However, upon stimulation with IL-2, strong activation of MAPK was observed. Stimulation of the chimeric EPOγ/9 receptor complex with EPO did not result in substantial induction of MAPK activity. These data suggest that the signaling pathways leading to proliferation are different in the IL-2R and IL-9R systems, and apparently are incomplete in the IL-9R system in this cellular context. These studies demonstrate that the functional IL-9R complex consists of heteromers of γc and IL-9Rα, as confirmed in a variety of cellular backgrounds and by various measurements of signal transduction. In a T cell line, STAT activation, induction of DNA synthesis and protection from apoptosis were observed exclusively upon engagement of both receptor subunits. The data presented here with various mutants of the γc or IL-9Rα cytoplasmic tail are also consistent with the “trigger driver” model proposed for signaling by various chimeric cytokine receptors (30Smets L.A. van den Berg J. Leuk. Lymphoma. 1996; 20: 199-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In this model, the γc chain acts in the IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL-9, and IL-15 receptors to initiate the signaling response upon engagement of ligand by conveying a kinase (JAK3) into the receptor complex. Within the IL-9R, the specificity of the resulting signaling response appears to be coupled to tyrosine residues within the IL-9Rα chain. The IL-9R and its associated JAK1 and JAK3 apparently activate a specific signaling program involving STAT-1 homodimers, STAT-1-STAT-3 heterodimers and STAT-5 homodimers as shown by antibody supershift analysis of nuclear extracts of stable transfectants. Furthermore, activation of these STAT complexes is linked to tyrosine 336 of IL-9Rα and does not depend upon tyrosines of the γcsubunit. Therefore, as in the IL-2, IL-4, and IL-7 receptors, specificity in the signaling program appears to be driven largely through the longer, non-γc subunit of the receptor. Consistent with earlier studies demonstrating JAK1 and JAK3 activation (20Yin T. Yang L. Yang Y.-C. Blood. 1995; 85: 3101-3106Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Yin T. Keller S.R. Quelle F.W. Witthuhn B.A. Tsang M.L.-S. Lienhard G.E. Ihle J.N. Yang Y.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20497-20502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) by IL-9, these kinases were observed to be crucial for generating STAT·DNA complexes in the IL-9R system. In the U4A system, simultaneous transfection of both JAK1 and JAK3 (along with the receptor chains and STAT-5) effectively reconstituted IL-9-mediated STAT-5 induction. Since these cells express Tyk2 endogenously, it is evident that Tyk2 could not replace either JAK1 or JAK3 to support IL-9R function. Additionally, the catalytic integrity of both of these kinases was essential for IL-9R function. These findings are consistent with those observed in the reconstitution experiments, in which endogenous Tyk2 and JAK1 were insufficient to support IL-9R function. Moreover, experiments with the U4A cell line lacking Tyk2 revealed definitively the dispensability of Tyk2 for IL-9R function. Therefore, although Tyk2 may be activated detectably by IL-9 in some cellular contexts, it does not appear to play a major role in IL-9R signaling function. IL-9R signals through chimeric receptors were found to stimulate short-term DNA synthesis of HT-2 cells. Strong proliferative effects of IL-9 have been observed only in mast cells and activated T-cells. Non-sustained proliferation, as observed here, could be due to a variety of signaling constraints that may be cell context-specific. The failure of the IL-9R to activate Erk1/Erk2 MAPK as measured in the short-term assay in this system is one such example, and other cell-specific pathways also need to be explored. Perhaps the most important function mediated by IL-9 is prevention of apoptosis, which was shown here to depend upon dimerization of the IL-9Rγ and γc subunits of the IL-9R. The molecular mechanism underlying the antiapoptotic effect remains to be elucidated. STAT-3 and/or STAT-5 may play a role, since they have been implicated in antiapoptotic effects in other signaling systems. For example, it was demonstrated that overexpression of a dominant-negative form of STAT-3 inhibited induction of the antiapoptotic gene bcl-2 upon stimulation of the IL-6R complex (31Fukada T. Hibi M. Yamanaka Y. Takahashi-Tezuka M. Fujitani Y. Yamaguchi T. Nakajima K. Hirano T. Immunity. 1996; 5: 449-460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar). Moreover, STAT-5 has been shown to bind to the activated glucocorticoid receptor and to inhibit glucocorticoid receptor-mediated gene transcription in COS-7 cells (32Stoecklin E. Wissler M. Gouilleux F. Groner B. Nature. 1996; 383: 726-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). Further studies are needed to clarify these and other possible mechanisms with regard to the IL-9R. Since apoptosis in general plays an important role in tissue homeostasis and regulation of the immune response (33Wyllie A.H. Kerr J.F.R. Currie A.R. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1980; 68: 251-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (6683) Google Scholar), clarifying mechanisms by which immune regulatory cytokines exert antiapoptotic activity and proliferative actions remains an important goal. The system presented here should prove useful in addressing these questions. We thank Drs.

Studies with animal model systems, however, suggest opposite effects. In HepG2 cells stably expressing estrogen receptor α (ERα), 17β-estradiol (E2) potently inhibited apoAI mRNA steady state levels. ApoAI promoter deletion mapping experiments indicated that ERα plus E2 inhibited apoAI activity through the liver-specific enhancer. Although the ERα DNA binding domain was essential but not sufficient for apoAI enhancer inhibition, ERα binding to the apoAI enhancer could not be detected by electrophoretic mobility shift assays. Western blotting and cotransfection assays showed that ERα plus E2 did not influence the abundance or the activity of the hepatocyte-enriched factors HNF-3β and HNF-4, two transcription factors essential for apoAI enhancer function. Expression of the ERα coactivator RIP140 dramatically repressed apoAI enhancer function in cotransfection experiments, suggesting that RIP140 may also function as a coactivator on the apoAI enhancer. Moreover, estrogen regulation of apoAI enhancer activity was dependent upon the balance between ERα and RIP140 levels. At low ratios of RIP140 to ERα, E2 repressed apoAI enhancer activity, whereas at high ratios this repression was reversed. Regulation of the apoAI gene by estrogen may thus vary in direction and magnitude depending not only on the presence of ERα and E2 but also upon the intracellular balance of ERα and coactivators utilized by ERα and the apoAI enhancer.

For example, numerous observational studies and a recent randomized trial have shown that estrogen replacement therapy increases apoAI and HDL plasma levels (9The Writing Group for the PEPI Trial J.

In cynomolgus monkeys, ethinyl estradiol or conjugated equine estrogen markedly reduces apoAI and HDL plasma levels (15Williams J.K. Anthony M.S. Honore E.K. Herrington D.M. Morgan T.M. Register T.C.

Similarly, ovariectomy increases hepatic apoAI mRNA levels in rats, further supporting the concept that estrogen may repress apoAI gene expression (17Staels B. Auwerx J. Chan L. van Tol A. Rosseneu M. Verhoeven G. J. Lipid Res. 1989; 30: 1137-1145Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, the ethinyl estradiol-induced increases in apoAI mRNA levels in these animals appears to occur via indirect dietary effects due to hormone treatment (17Staels B. Auwerx J. Chan L. van Tol A. Rosseneu M. Verhoeven G. J. Lipid Res. 1989; 30: 1137-1145Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Further, estrogen-induced increases in apoAI transcription rates in rats are dependent on the strains used (6Tang J. Srivastava R.A.K. Krul E.S. Baumann D. Pfleger B.A. Kitchens R.T. Schonfeld G. J. Lipid Res. 1991; 32: 1571-1581Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Liver-specific expression of the apoAI gene is conferred by a powerful hepatocyte-specific enhancer located in the nucleotide region −220 to −110 upstream of the apoAI transcriptional start site (18Widom R.L. Ladias J.A. Kouidou S. Karathanasis S.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 677-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The activity of the enhancer depends on synergistic interactions between transcription factors bound to three distinct sites: A (−214 to −192), B (−169 to −146), and C (−134 to −119) within the enhancer (18Widom R.L.

Estrogen signal transduction involves high affinity binding to intracellular ERs, ligand-induced conformational changes of ERs leading to the recruitment of transcriptional auxiliary factors, binding of ERs to estrogen response elements (EREs) in gene promoters, and regulation of transcriptional activity in conjunction with other transcription factors bound to their cognate sites in the promoter. Recent efforts to characterize ER transcription auxiliary factors have led to the identification of a growing number of coactivators such as Trip/Sug1 (30Lee J.W. Ryan F. Swaffield J.C. Johnston S.A.

Although all of these proteins bind ERα in a ligand-dependent fashion, the mechanisms by which they modulate ER signaling and “cross-talk” with other signal transduction pathways is not understood. Recent findings indicate that the related coactivators p300 (37Dyson N. Harlow E. Cancer Surv. 1992; 12: 161-195PubMed Google Scholar) and CBP (38Kwok R.P. Lundblad J.R. Chrivia J.D. Richards J.P.

Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 4516-4521PubMed Google Scholar).This report shows that ERα and 17β-estradiol repress apoAI promoter activity in human hepatoma HepG2 cells. This effect appears to be due to ERα partitioning of coactivators required for apoAI enhancer function in liver cells. The data suggest that RIP140 may play an important role in apoAI enhancer function and ERα-mediated repression. We propose that estrogen effects on apoAI gene expression vary in direction and magnitude depending upon the balance of coactivators shared by ERα and the apoAI enhancer.DISCUSSIONThe apoAI liver-specific enhancer plays a central role in integration of diverse physiological and environmental signals affecting apoAI gene expression. Our working hypothesis is that signal-induced transient multiprotein complexes containing both DNA binding factors and factors not directly bound to DNA assemble onto the apoAI enhancer and regulate one or more steps in transcription initiation.In this study, estrogenic signals influenced apoAI expression at the mRNA level by repressing apoAI gene transcription. More specifically, ERα and E2 potently repressed apoAI liver-specific enhancer activity in a ligand- and receptor-dependent manner. Although gel shift experiments did not provide evidence for ERα binding to the enhancer, the DBD was essential for apoAI repression. In addition, the ERα transcription activation functions AF1 and AF2, although not sufficient by themselves, were individually essential for repression when associated with the DBD. Experiments with ERα mutants showed that the combination of the DBD and AF2 domain is as effective in enhancer repression as the wild type ERα, whereas the combination of the DBD and AF1 domain is only 50% as effective as full-length ERα. All ERα mutants tested were capable of ligand binding (51Mader S. Kumar V. deVerneuil H. Chambon P. Nature. 1989; 338: 271-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar, 57Lees J.A. Fawell S.E. Parker M.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 5477-5488Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 58Danielian P.S. White R. Lees J.A. Parker M.G. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1025-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar), and apoAI enhancer repression by them was strictly ligand-dependent. Thus, it appears that a ligand-induced change in the receptor cooperates with the DBD and either AF1 or AF2 to impart an apoAI enhancer repressing activity.How does ERα and E2 repress apoAI enhancer function? Previous studies showed that maximal activity of the apoAI enhancer depends on synergistic interactions between transcription factors bound to enhancer sites A, B, and C (18Widom R.L. Ladias J.A. Kouidou S. Karathanasis S.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 677-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Because ERα does not bind to the enhancer under our gel-shifting conditions, repression mechanisms involving transcription interference by quenching (59Levine M. Manley J.L. Cell. 1989; 59: 405-408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar) seem unlikely. ERα may repress the apoAI enhancer by inhibiting the activity of transcription factors required for enhancer function (see for example Refs. 42Blobel G.A. Sieff C.A. Orkin S.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3147-3153Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar and 56Stein B. Yang M.X. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4971-4979Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For example, we have recently observed that adenovirus E1A inhibits apoAI enhancer activity by selective inactivation of HNF-3, the factor that binds to site B. 2E. Kilbourne and S. K. Karathanasis, unpublished data. To test this possibility, two liver-specific transcription factors, HNF-4 and HNF-3β, involved in apoAI enhancer function were assayed. The results showed that neither HNF-3β nor HNF-4 activities or protein levels were influenced by ERα plus E2, suggesting that ERα represses the apoAI enhancer at some other level. Although the possibility that ERα activates a repressing transcription factor that binds to the enhancer and inhibits its function cannot be unequivocally excluded, the observation that ERα could mediate apoAI enhancer repression independent of individual cis-elements mutations within the enhancer suggests that repression occurs at a level secondary to DNA binding.An alternative explanation for the ERα- and E2-induced repression of the apoAI enhancer is that a coactivator common to the enhancer and ERα is partitioned to ERα, leading to transcriptional interference with the enhancer. HNF-4, which binds to site A, is a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily and could share coactivators with ERα similar to other nuclear receptors (reviewed in Ref. 41Glass C.K. Rose D.W. Rosenfeld M.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 222-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar). For example, partitioning of p300/CBP to ERα was recently shown to be the major mechanism of transcriptional interference between ERα and the progesterone receptor (39Smith C.L. Onate S.A. Tasi M. O'Malley B.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8884-8888Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar) or the transcription factor AP-1 (36Kamei Y. Xu L. Heinzel T. Torchia J. Kurokawa R. Gloss B. Lin S.C. Heyman R.A. Rose D.W. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Cell. 1996; 85: 403-414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1916) Google Scholar). The involvement of coactivators in nuclear receptor function and their importance in apoAI enhancer function prompted us to test the possibility that CBP or RIP140 is involved in apoAI enhancer function. The results showed that expression of CBP does not affect apoAI enhancer activity. However, similar experiments with RIP140 showed that this cofactor repressed apoAI enhancer activity, reminiscent of the RIP140 squelching effects on ERα activation (33Cavailles V. Dauvois S. L'Horset F. Lopez G. Hoare S. Kushner P.J. Parker M.G. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3741-3751Crossref PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar). In the presence of E2, low RIP140 expression vector levels reversed the ERα-mediated repression of apoAI enhancer activity. Therefore, RIP140-like factors may be one class of non-DNA binding coactivators involved in apoAI enhancer function that are partitioned to ERα.The observation that two different activation functions in ERα (i.e. AF1 and AF2) can in conjunction with the DBD repress apoAI enhancer activity independently of each other raises the possibility that ERα partitions an additional cofactor(s) involved in apoAI enhancer function. Consistent with this, RIP140 interaction with ERα requires a functional AF2 domain (60Joyeaux A. Cavailles V. Balaguer P. Nicolas J.C. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 193-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) that is inactive in the ERα mutant AF1-DBD-X that represses enhancer activity. Therefore a model whereby, in addition to RIP140, ERα shares other cofactors with the apoAI enhancer and RIP140 binding to ERα alters its conformation, so that some, but not all, of these factors are released and used by the enhancer is possible.How could the disparities regarding ERα regulation of apoAI and HDL plasma levels between different cell and animal systems (see the Introduction) be reconciled? It is clear from our previous work that the multiprotein complexes assembled onto the apoAI enhancer are transient, and their protein composition is influenced by the prevailing developmental, physiological, and environmental factors affecting apoAI gene expression. For example, although apoAI enhancer activity does not depend on retinoids, prior repression of enhancer activity by the nuclear receptor apolipoprotein AI regulatory protein-1 converts the enhancer into a retinoid-responsive element (61Widom R.L. Rhee M. Karathanasis S.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3380-3389Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A similar phenomenon may be occurring with E2 in which the state of the apoAI enhancer due to intracellular coactivator levels determines the mode of ERα regulation. When cofactors shared by the apoAI enhancer and ERα are present in limiting amounts compared with ERα, their partitioning by ERα will result in enhancer inhibition. This latter case appears to be operating in the Hep89 cell system. In contrast, when these cofactors are in excess compared with ERα and apoAI enhancer activity is partially repressed due to endogenous squelching, estrogen-activated ERα will alleviate repression by partitioning cofactors in excess and result in enhancer stimulation. Consistent with this, the low level enhancer activity obtained at high RIP140 expression vector levels was stimulated 3-fold by ERα in a ligand-dependent fashion. In addition, differences in ERα affinity for these coactivators, induced by different ligands, may explain the opposite effects of different estogen agonists and antagonists on apoAI plasma levels (62Saarto T. Blomqvist C. Ehnholm C. Taskinen M.R. Elomaa I. J. Clin. Oncol. 1996; 14: 429-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 63Anthony M.S. Clarkson T.B. Hughes J., C.L. Morgan T.M. Burke G.L. J. Nutr. 1996; 126: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). Therefore, we propose that the effects of estrogen on apoAI gene transcription will depend upon the balance between cofactors shared by the apoAI enhancer and ERα and may explain the disparities observed for apoAI gene regulation by E2 obtained using different cell and animal systems. Apolipoprotein AI (apoAI) 1The abbreviations used are: apoAI, apolipoprotein AI; HDL, high density lipoprotein; HNF, hepatocyte nuclear factor; ER, estrogen receptor; ERE, estrogen response element; CBEB, cAMP-response element binding protein; CBP, CREB-binding protein; DBD, DNA binding domain; E2, 17β-estradiol; CMV, cytomegalovirus. 1The abbreviations used are: apoAI, apolipoprotein AI; HDL, high density lipoprotein; HNF, hepatocyte nuclear factor; ER, estrogen receptor; ERE, estrogen response element; CBEB, cAMP-response element binding protein; CBP, CREB-binding protein; DBD, DNA binding domain; E2, 17β-estradiol; CMV, cytomegalovirus. is the major protein constituent of plasma high density lipoproteins (HDLs), a class of lipoproteins thought to play a major role in protection against atherosclerosis (reviewed in Ref. 1Karathanasis S.K. Monogr. Hum. Genet. 1992; 14: 140-171Crossref Google Scholar). Because plasma HDL levels are correlated with plasma apoAI and liver apoAI mRNA levels (2Sorci-Thomas M. Prack M.M. Dashti N. Johnson F.

Lipid Res. 1989; 30: 1397-1403Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it is thought that factors affecting apoAI gene expression play an important role in atherosclerosis susceptibility. Although a number of pharmacological, dietary, and physiological factors affect apoAI and HDL plasma levels (3Vandenbrouck Y. Lambert G. Janvier B. Girlich D. Bereziat G. Mangeney-Andreani M.

Thromb. 1993; 13: 1505-1514Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the underlying molecular mechanisms remain obscure. For example, numerous observational studies and a recent randomized trial have shown that estrogen replacement therapy increases apoAI and HDL plasma levels (9The Writing Group for the PEPI Trial J. Am. Med. Assoc. 1995; 273: 199-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (2335) Google Scholar, 10Barrett-Connor E.

Alberts J.J. Hazzard W.R. J. Lipid Res. 1989; 30: 1895-1906Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have been suggested as potential mechanisms. Work with animals has further complicated the issue. In cynomolgus monkeys, ethinyl estradiol or conjugated equine estrogen markedly reduces apoAI and HDL plasma levels (15Williams J.K. Anthony M.S.

Morgan T.M. Koritnik D.R. Adams M.R. Kaplan J.R. Obstet. Gynecol. 1990; 75: 217-222PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, ovariectomy increases hepatic apoAI mRNA levels in rats, further supporting the concept that estrogen may repress apoAI gene expression (17Staels B. Auwerx J. Chan L. van Tol A. Rosseneu M. Verhoeven G. J. Lipid Res. 1989; 30: 1137-1145Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, the ethinyl estradiol-induced increases in apoAI mRNA levels in these animals appears to occur via indirect dietary effects due to hormone treatment (17Staels B. Auwerx J. Chan L. van Tol A. Rosseneu M. Verhoeven G. J. Lipid Res. 1989; 30: 1137-1145Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Further, estrogen-induced increases in apoAI transcription rates in rats are dependent on the strains used (6Tang J. Srivastava R.A.K. Krul E.S. Baumann D. Pfleger B.A. Kitchens R.T. Schonfeld G. J. Lipid Res. 1991; 32: 1571-1581Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Liver-specific expression of the apoAI gene is conferred by a powerful hepatocyte-specific enhancer located in the nucleotide region −220 to −110 upstream of the apoAI transcriptional start site (18Widom R.L.

https://openalex.org/W2000814287,"Human replication protein A (RPA) is a three-subunit protein complex (70-, 34-, and 11-kDa subunits) involved in DNA replication, repair, and recombination. Both the 70- (p70) and 34-kDa (p34) subunits interact with Xeroderma pigmentosumgroup A complementing protein (XPA), a key protein involved in nucleotide excision repair. Our deletion analysis indicated that no particular domain(s) of RPA p70 was essential for its interaction with XPA, whereas 33 amino acids from the C terminus of p34 (p34Δ33C) were necessary for the XPA interaction. Furthermore, mutant RPA lacking the p34 C terminus failed to interact with XPA, suggesting that p34, not p70, is primarily responsible for the interaction of RPA with XPA. RPA stimulated the interaction of XPA with UV-damaged DNA through an RPA-XPA complex on damaged DNA sites because (i) the RPA mutant lacking the C terminus of p34 failed to stimulate an XPA-DNA interaction, and (ii) the ssDNA binding domain of RPA (amino acids 296–458) was necessary for the stimulation of the XPA-DNA interaction. Two separate domains of p70, a single-stranded DNA binding domain and a zinc-finger domain, were necessary for RPA function in nucleotide excision repair. The mutant RPA (RPA:p34Δ33C), which lacks its stimulatory effect on the XPA-DNA interaction, also poorly supported nucleotide excision repair, suggesting that the XPA-RPA interaction on damaged DNA is necessary for DNA repair activity.

Human replication protein A (also known as human single-stranded DNA-binding protein) is composed of three tightly associated polypeptides (70-, 34-, and 11-kDa subunits). It was originally identified as a factor required for in vitro SV40 DNA replication (1Wobbe C.R. Weissbach L. Borowiec J.A. Dean F.B. Murakami Y. Bullock P. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

During replication, RPA binds to and stabilizes the ssDNA generated at the replication forks and stimulates DNA polymerase α activity, suggesting it has a role in both initiation and elongation (9Wold M.S. Weinberg D.H. Virshup D.M. Li J.J. Kelly T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 264: 2801-2809Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar, 10Kenny M.K. Lee S.-H. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Recent mutational analysis, however, indicates that the ssDNA binding activity of RPA, but not its ability to stimulate DNA polymerase, is essential for SV40 DNA replication (12Kim D.-K. Stigger E. Lee S.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15124-15129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The involvement of RPA in DNA repair has been shown in human and yeast nucleotide excision repair systems (13Coverly D. Kenny M.K. Munn M. Rupp W.D. Lane D.P. Wood R.D.

Similar to its function in replication, RPA appears to be involved in multiple stages of the DNA repair process. Its role in the early stage of repair was suggested because the RPA requirement can be bypassed by the presence ofEscherichia coli UvrABC, which incises damaged DNA (14Coverly D. Kenny M.K. Lane D.P. Wood R.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 3873-3881Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). This early stage involvement includes the interaction of RPA with the UV damage recognition factor XPA (17Matsuda T. Saijo M. Kuraoka I. Kobayashi T. Nakatsu Y. Nagai A. Enjoji T. Masutani C.

After forming an RPA-XPA complex on damaged DNA, RPA recruits XPG and ERCC1-XPF, two endonucleases that are likely involved in the 3′ and 5′ incision reactions (18He Z. Henricksen L.A. Wold M.S.

RPA is also involved in the later stage gap-filling reaction, which requires PCNA, RF-C (A1), and DNA polymerase δ (or ε) (22Aboussekhra A. Biggerstaff M. Shivji M.K.K. Vilpo J.A. Moncollin V. Podust V.N. Protic M. Hubscher U. Egly J.-M. Wood R.D. Cell. 1995; 80: 859-868Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (750) Google Scholar). In the mammalian system, RPA p34 phosphorylation is induced by DNA damage (UV or x-ray). DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) was shown to be responsible for the hyperphosphorylation of RPA p34 (23Carty M.P. Zernik-Kobak M. McGrath S. Dixon K. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2114-2123Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 24Liu V.F. Weaver D.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7222-7231Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar); however, recent in vivo observations suggest the possible involvement of other kinases (25Fried L Koumenis C. Peterson S.R. Green S.L. van Zijl P. Allalunis-Turner J. Chen D.J. Fishel R. Giaccia A.J. Brown J.M. Kirchgessner C.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Human and mouse cells deficient in DNA-PK activity are not only defective in site-specific recombination but are also very sensitive to DNA damage, suggesting a role for DNA-PK (and possibly RPA phosphorylation) in these processes (26Lees-Miller S.P.

In addition, extracts from UV-irradiated HeLa cells poorly support SV40 DNA replication compared with those from nonirradiated cells (23Carty M.P. Zernik-Kobak M. McGrath S. Dixon K. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2114-2123Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). UV damage-induced inhibition of replication correlates with RPA phosphorylation and is reversed by the addition of purified RPA to an in vitro system, suggesting a role for RPA phosphorylation in damage-induced inhibition of replication (23Carty M.P. Zernik-Kobak M. McGrath S. Dixon K. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2114-2123Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). However, no biologic function for RPA phosphorylation has yet been identified. RPA is involved in recombination through its stimulation of strand exchange reactions in vitro (28Heyer W.-D. Rao M.R.S. Erdile L.F. Kelly T.J. Kolodner R.D. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2321-2329Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) and its requirement in homologous recombination (29Sung P. Robberson D.L. Cell. 1995; 82: 453-461Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). Recently, RPA was shown to interact with Rad52, a protein required for recombination and strand-break repair (30Shinohara A. Ogawa H. Ogawa T. Cell. 1992; 69: 457-470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1052) Google Scholar, 31Park M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15467-15470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In addition, the RPA-Rad52 interaction seems to be required for homologous recombination in vivo (32Park M.S. Ludwig D.L. Stigger E. Lee S.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18996-19000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). RPA forms a complex in an orderly manner such that p34 and p11 form a stable subcomplex to which p70 is then added (33Stigger E. Dean F.B. Hurwitz J. Lee S.-H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The p34 phosphorylation sites for DNA-PK and cyclin-dependent kinase have recently been mapped to its N-terminal domain (38Zernik-Kobak M. Vasunia K. Connelly M. Anderson C.W. Dixon K. J. Biol.

In this report, we analyzed RPA function in nucleotide excision repair by examining various RPA mutants. We found that the C-terminal domain of RPA p34 is responsible for RPA interaction with XPA. This interaction is necessary for the formation of a stable RPA-XPA complex on DNA. An RPA mutant lacking the p34 C terminus poorly supported DNA repair, which strongly suggests that the XPA-RPA interaction is necessary for efficient DNA repair. We also found two p70 domains (a ssDNA binding domain and a zinc finger motif) that were essential for nucleotide excision repair. A plasmid expressing glutathione S-transferase (GST)-Rad52 was described previously (32Park M.S. Ludwig D.L. Stigger E. Lee S.-H. J. Biol.

Random oligonucleotides (90-mer, 5′-GACGGCCGGATCCATGTACCCCTACGACGTGCCCGACTACGCCAGCCTGGGCGGCCCCCTGCCCAGAGGCAGCCCCGCACCTTCTCAAGC-3′; 67-mer, 5′-GATCGATCGAGCGGCCGCCAAGATGTACCCCTACGACGTGCCCGACTACGCCTGGAACAGTGGATTC-3′; 44-mer, AAAAGCCTCCTCACTACTTCTGGAATAGCTCAGAGGCCGAGGAT-3′; 27-mer, 5′-GCCCCGCACCTGCTCAAGCCGAAAAGA-3′) were synthesized by the Molecular Resource Center at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN. The DNA plasmid, p5A (4.5 kbp), represents pBluescript (pBS, 3 kbp) in which the 1.45-kb full-length cDNA for RPA p34 had been inserted. This plasmid was prepared for the nucleotide excision repair assay by two rounds of CsCl gradient centrifugation (40Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) followed by 5–20% sucrose density gradient centrifugation at 25,000 rpm for 19 h at 2 °C. pBS (3 kbp) was prepared by two rounds of CsCl centrifugation from the E. coli strain JM109 (recA), without chloramphenicol amplification. The purified pBS (500 μg) was suspended in 10 ml of TE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA) and thin-layered in a plastic Petri dish (150 mm) with gentle rocking. The Petri dish was then UV-irradiated with germicidal UV light (G15T8) at a fluence rate of 0.9 watt/m2. UV fluence was measured by using a Black-Ray UV meter (UVP, Inc., Upland, CA). After UV irradiation, the DNA was treated with E. coli Nth protein, and closed circular supercoiled DNA was isolated by CsCl gradient centrifugation followed by sucrose gradient centrifugation, as described previously (41Wood R.D. Robins P. Lindahl T. Cell. 1988; 53: 97-106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). Even though the primary source of UV was UV-C (254 nm in wavelength), the final preparation of irradiated plasmid DNA contained more than 90% supercoiled circular duplex DNA (data not shown). Construction of recombinant baculoviruses containing either wild-type or mutant RPA subunits were described previously (8Lee S.-H. Kim D.K. J. Biol.

Sf-9 cells (2.0 × 106) were plated on a 60-mm dish and infected with individual recombinant baculoviruses encoding RPA subunits at a multiplicity of infection of 15 for approximately 40 h at 27 °C. The insect cells were then labeled with trans35S-labeled methionine at 200 μCi/ml (1200–1600 Ci/mmol) for 4 h in methionine-free medium containing 5% dialyzed fetal calf serum. Cells were briefly washed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed for 1 h on ice in 0.5 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 250 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mmNaF, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mg/ml leupeptin, and 0.2 mg/ml antipain). For immunoprecipitation, cleared cell lysates (50 μl) were incubated with the indicated polyclonal antibody (5 μl) in the presence of bovine serum albumin (200 μg/ml) at 4 °C with rocking. Protein A-Sepharose was then added, and the mixture was incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were collected by centrifugation, washed 5 times with cell lysis buffer, and analyzed by 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). Unless otherwise specified, aliquots (0.4–1.0 ml) of GST fusion protein containing lysates were adjusted to 0.5% nonfat dried milk and add to 25 μl of glutathione-Sepharose beads that had been washed three times and resuspended (1:1 (v/v)) in NETN buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) containing 0.5% dried milk. The aliquots were then rocked for 30 min at 4 °C. After being washed 3 times with NETN containing 0.5% dried milk, the beads were incubated with lysates containing target protein (or purified protein) for 1 h at 4 °C on a rocker and then washed 5 times with NETN. For a direct analysis of the proteins bound to the beads, the beads were mixed with SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and proteins were resolved on SDS-PAGE. Proteins were then visualized either by fluorography or immunoblotting. To purify bound GST-XPA, proteins bound to the GST beads were eluted with elution buffer (40% ethylene glycol, 10% glycerol, 1.5 m NaCl, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm DTT), and dialyzed against buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mmNaCl, 0.02% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 10% glycerol, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 100 μg/l antipain and leupeptin) overnight. Protein samples were separated by 12% SDS-PAGE as described previously (42Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207472) Google Scholar). Proteins were then transferred to nitrocellulose (BA83; Bio-Rad), immunoblotted with an anti-p70 (or anti-p34) rabbit polyclonal antibody (33Stigger E. Dean F.B. Hurwitz J. Lee S.-H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 579-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), and detected by 125I-protein A (Amersham). Wild-type RPA and RPA mutants, PCNA, and XPA were isolated by the procedures described previously (12Kim D.-K. Stigger E. Lee S.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15124-15129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar,20Lee S.-H. Kim D.K. Drissi R. J. Biol.

Cunningham (State University of New York, Albany, NY) and purified according to the published procedure (43O'Handley S. Scholes C.P. Cunningham J.P. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 2528-2536Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). DNA-PK was kindly provided by Dr. C. Anderson (Brookhaven National Laboratory, Long Island, NY) (44Lees-Miller S.P. Sakaguchi K. Ullrich S. Appella E. Anderson C.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5041-5050Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). HeLa whole cell extracts were prepared as described previously (41Wood R.D. Robins P. Lindahl T. Cell. 1988; 53: 97-106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). Briefly, asynchronously grown HeLa cells (5 × 109) were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in hypotonic buffer (20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.5, 5 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT). Protease inhibitors (0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mg/ml leupeptin, and 0.2 mg/ml antipain) were then added, and the swollen cells were broken by 15–20 strokes in a dounce homogenizer. An equal volume of buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mmMgCl2, 2 mm DTT, 25% sucrose, and 50% glycerol) was added to the dounce-homogenized extracts followed by one-eighth volume of saturated ammonium sulfate solution, pH 7.5. The mixture was then stirred for 30 min on ice. After centrifugation at 41,000 rpm for 3 h at 2 °C, the supernatant was collected, and proteins were precipitated by the addition of ammonium sulfate (0.33 g/ml). After centrifugation, the precipitates were resuspended and dialyzed against buffer (25 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.9, 0.1m KCl, 12 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm DTT, and 17% glycerol). To prepare protein fractions lacking RPA, HeLa cell extracts (20 ml, 350 mg of protein) were ammonium sulfate-fractionated as described previously (1Wobbe C.R. Weissbach L. Borowiec J.A. Dean F.B. Murakami Y. Bullock P. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 82: 5710-5714Crossref Scopus (228) Google Scholar). The ammonium sulfate-(35–65%) fraction was dialyzed against buffer A containing 150 mm KCl and loaded onto a phosphocellulose column (PC; 15 ml) that was preequilibrated with buffer A containing 150 mm KCl. After washing the column with the same buffer, bound proteins were eluted with buffer A containing 1.0 m KCl. The PC-1.0 m fraction, which represents the fraction of HeLa whole cell extracts that bound to the PC column in the presence of 0.1 m KCl and is eluted with 1.0 m KCl, was pooled and dialyzed against buffer A (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, and 10% glycerol) containing 50 mm KCl and then used as a receptor fraction for the RPA complementation assay in repair (the PC-1.0 m fraction also lacks the repair protein PCNA). To prepare the DNA substrate, pBS plasmid was digested with BstN1 and a 121-bp fragment isolated from the agarose gel. After being labeled with [γ-32P]ATP by the action of polynucleotide kinase, the DNA was irradiated with a germicidal UV lamp to prepare UV-damaged DNA. The reaction mixtures (100 μl) contained 25 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.5), 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 100 mm KCl, bovine serum albumin (200 μg/ml), 0.1 μg of poly(dI:dC), 50 fmol of either irradiated or nonirradiated 5′-[32P]DNA (121 bp), and the indicated amounts of GST-XPA and/or RPA. After a 15-min incubation at 30 °C, NETN buffer containing 0.5% dried milk and GST beads was added, and the reactions were processed as described for the GST fusion pull-down assay. After the GST beads were washed, the samples were analyzed for [32P]DNA on a 5% polyacrylamide gel containing 0.1% SDS. Nucleotide excision repair of UV-damaged DNA was carried out according to the published procedure (41Wood R.D. Robins P. Lindahl T. Cell. 1988; 53: 97-106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). Reaction mixtures (50 μl) contained 0.2 μg each of UV-irradiated (450 J/m2) pBS (3 kbp) and nonirradiated p5A (4.5 kbp), 40 mm creatine phosphate-di-Tris salt, pH 7.7, 1 μg of creatine kinase, 50 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.8, 70 mm KCl, 7.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.4 mm EDTA, 2 mm ATP, 20 μm each dGTP, dCTP, TTP, 8 μm[α-32P]dATP (25,000 cpm/pmol), 5 μg of bovine serum albumin, and 150 μg of the PC-1.0 m fraction of HeLa whole cell extracts. After incubation for 3 h at 30 °C, DNA was isolated from the reaction mixtures, linearized with BamHI, and separated by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis in the presence of 0.5 μg/ml ethidium bromide. The DNA and repair products were analyzed by both fluorography and exposure to x-ray film. RPA interacts with SV40 Tag, XPA, and human Rad52, key proteins involved in replication, repair, and recombination, respectively. These interactions are essential to the function of RPA in DNA metabolism. We and others have shown that both p70 and p34 interact with XPA, Rad52 (17Matsuda T. Saijo M. Kuraoka I. Kobayashi T.

Chem. 1996; 271: 18996-19000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), and SV40 Tag (data not shown) and have suggested that RPA may function in all three DNA metabolic events by interacting with key proteins in replication, repair, and recombination. To identify the domain(s) of RPA p70 and p34 involved in these protein-protein interactions, we examined p70 and p34 deletion mutants for their ability to interact with XPA. An GST-XPA fusion protein was used to pull down the metabolically labeled RPA p70 or p34 (Fig. 1, panel A). Compared with the amount of mutant p70 immunoprecipitated by the anti-p70 antibody, only a fraction of the p70 in lysates was pulled down by the GST fusion protein (Fig. 1, panel B). In addition, no particular domain for p70 binding to XPA was identified. In contrast, p34 interacted efficiently with XPA (Fig. 1, panel C). Of interest, XPA interacted with a p34 mutant that had an N-terminal deletion (p34Δ2-30) as well as a mutant that had a serine-to-alanine substitution in its cdk consensus sites (amino acids 23 and 29); however, XPA did not interact with a p34 mutant that lacked 33 amino acids at its C terminus (Fig. 1, panel C). To further analyze the RPA-XPA interaction, we examined purified RPA complexes containing either p34 that lacked the C terminus (p34Δ33C) or p70 that lacked the ssDNA binding domain (ΔRS) for their interaction with XPA. Mutant RPA that lacked the p34 C terminus failed to interact with XPA, whereas RPA containing the p70 mutant (ΔRS) interacted with XPA (Fig. 2). All other RPAs containing various p70 mutants also supported the RPA-XPA interaction (data not shown). It should be pointed out, however, that our failure to detect p34Δ33C in the GST-XPA pulldown assay (Fig. 2 B) might be due to the much reduced band intensities compared with the Western blot band intensities shown in Fig. 2 A. Overall, our result suggests that XPA interacts with RPA primarily through the C terminus of p34. Previous reports demonstrated that XPA binding to damaged DNA is enhanced by the presence of RPA (18He Z. Henricksen L.A. Wold M.S. Ingel C.J. Nature. 1995; 374: 566-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar, 19Li L. Lu X. Petersen C.A. Legerski R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5396-5402Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar), even though both XPA and RPA can independently bind to damaged DNA (45Jones C.J. Wood R.D. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 12096-12104Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 46Burns J.L. Guzder S.N. Sung P. Prakash S. Prakash L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11607-11610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). We examined the effect of RPA on the interaction of XPA with DNA by using purified GST-XPA in a pull-down assay to measure the interaction of XPA with a 5′-labeled 121-bp fragment of damaged and nondamaged dsDNA. The purified GST-XPA used in this experiment was described previously (17Matsuda T. Saijo M. Kuraoka I. Kobayashi T. Nakatsu Y. Nagai A. Enjoji T. Masutani C. Sugasawa K. Hanaoka F. Yasui A. Tanaka K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4152-4157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) and was functionally active in nucleotide excision repair (data not shown). Consistent with a previous study (45Jones C.J. Wood R.D. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 12096-12104Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar), XPA alone showed a strong interaction with damaged DNA (8 kJ/m2) but not with nondamaged DNA (Fig. 3, panel A). The XPA-damaged DNA interaction was significantly stimulated (up to 4-fold) by the addition of RPA (Fig. 3, panel B). The weak interaction between XPA and nondamaged DNA was also stimulated by RPA (Fig. 3, panel B, lanes 2–4), which may be explained by the fact that RPA binds to dsDNA in a nonspecific manner (9Wold M.S. Weinberg D.H. Virshup D.M. Li J.J. Kelly T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 264: 2801-2809Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar, 11Brill S.J. Stillman B.

We examined whether the stimulatory effect of RPA on the XPA-DNA interaction occurs through the interaction of RPA with XPA on DNA. For"

Western blot analysis of subcellular fractions from sucrose equilibrium density gradients and glycerol velocity gradients of homogenates from stably transfected cells revealed hVAChT immunoreactivity in fractions that contain synaptophysin, a marker of synaptic vesicles, while hVMAT2 immunoreactivity was confined to heavy fractions containing chromogranin B, a marker of large dense core vesicles. In cells treated with nerve growth factor, hVAChT immunoreactivity alone co-localized with synaptophysin and was abundantly expressed on synaptic vesicle clusters. Chimeras between hVMAT2 and hVAChT were utilized to identify the domain of hVAChT required for its expression on synaptic vesicles and which would shift the expression of hVMAT2 from large dense core vesicles to synaptic vesicles. Biochemical, immunocytochemical, and electron microscopic analyses revealed that a chimera in which the cytoplasmic tail of hVMAT2 was replaced with hVAChT sequences was now preferentially targeted to synaptic vesicles. In addition, hVAChT expression on synaptic vesicles was nearly abolished when the hVMAT2 cytoplasmic tail was present. Thus, structural information resides within the terminal cytoplasmic domain of VAChT, which specifically targets it to synaptic vesicles.

The biogenesis and fate of these organelles and targeting of various proteins to them differ in several ways (1Navone F. Jahn R. DiGioia G. Stukenbrok H. Greengard P. De Camilli P. J.

LDCVs (approximately 200 nm) are the product of the trans-Golgi network as they contain soluble glycoproteins, such as the chromogranins, and various neuropeptides. Following maturation and subsequent exocytosis at the plasma membrane, components of the LDCV membrane must recycle to the Golgi complex to replenish their soluble neurohormone content and re-enter the regulated secretory pathway. In contrast, synaptic vesicle proteins, such as synaptophysin (p38), appear to travel to the plasma membrane via the constitutive secretory pathway and are then endocytosed and sorted in endosomes, from which synaptic vesicles (40 nm) bud. Exocytosis/endocytosis and recycling of cholinergic synaptic vesicles takes place at the presynaptic nerve terminal, while neuropeptide- and monoamine-containing LDCVs, located throughout the cell, may release nonsynaptically (7Thureson-Klein A.K.

Cloning and characterization of the family of vesicular transporters for biogenic amines and ACh has provided new tools for the study of the biogenesis of these regulated secretory organelles (11Varoqui H.

The examination of the subcellular localization of these proteins indicates that they are associated with distinct vesicle populations in neurons and neuroendocrine cells. The endocrine-specific VMAT1 isoform is expressed on LDCVs of the rat adrenal medulla (13Liu Y. Schweitzer E.S. Nirenberg M.J. Pickel V.M. Evans C.J. Edwards R.H. J.

The trafficking of VMATs and VAChT and biogenesis of LDCVs and synaptic vesicles can be studied using the pheochromocytoma (PC12) cell line. PC12s are mixed monoaminergic/cholinergic cells that synthesize, store, and secrete ACh as well as dopamine (21Green L.A. Rein G.

In the present study, we examined whether VAChT sorting to synaptic vesicles relies on a unique targeting domain. We first compared the expression of the human homologues of VAChT and VMAT2 against the rat neuroendocrine PC12 cell background and find that these proteins are targeted to synaptic vesicles and LDCVs, respectively. The subcellular distribution of chimeric hVMAT2/hVAChT molecules was then examined, and the results demonstrate that the cytoplasmic tail of VAChT is necessary and sufficient for synaptic vesicle targeting in PC12 cells. Rat PC12 cells were maintained at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 95% air, 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 7% fetal bovine serum, 7% heat-inactivated horse serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 mg/ml), and glutamine (4 mm). The stable PC12 cell line expressing hVAChT used was described previously (34Varoqui H. Erickson J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27229-27232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The hVMAT2 (35Erickson J.D. Schäfer M.K.-H. Bonner T.I. Eiden L.E. Weihe E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5166-5171Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar) and chimeric cDNAs were subcloned into Rc/CMV (Invitrogen) at the HindIII and NotI sites. PC12 cells were transfected with the various constructs using Lipofectin (10 mg/ml; Life Technologies, Inc.), and stable transformants were selected with 0.5 mg/ml Geneticin (G418; Life Technologies, Inc.). G418-resistant colonies were picked and grown overnight on collagen-coated four-chamber permanox slides. Cells were fixed for 2 h in 10% formalin/phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and incubated with species-specific hVAChT or isoform-specific hVMAT2 antipeptide polyclonal antisera at a final dilution of 1:2000 in PBS, 0.1% Triton, 3% normal goat serum. Primary antibodies were visualized using VectaStain kit (Vector Laboratories Inc.). Polyclonal antipeptide antibodies against the C-terminal amino acids of rVMAT1, hVMAT2, and hVAChT (35Erickson J.D.

Neurosci. 1995; 6: 225-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) were affinity-purified using the immunogenic peptide and SulfoLink kit (Pierce). Polyclonal antibodies against chromogranin B (CgB) were a generous gift of Reiner Fischer-Colbrie (Innsbrück). Ian S. Trowbridge (The Salk Institute, La Jolla, CA) kindly provided the monoclonal antibody (H68.4) against human transferrin receptor (TFR). Monoclonal antibodies directed against synaptophysin (p38) were purchased from Sigma. A unique BstBI restriction site was introduced into the hVAChT cDNA at the junction between the putative 12th transmembrane domain and the cytoplasmic tail (amino acids RN; see Fig. 6) using the method of Deng and Nickoloff (38Deng W.P. Nickoloff J.A. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 200: 81-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar). An equivalent site is found in the wild-type hVMAT2 cDNA. The Escherichia coli BMH 71–18mutS bacterial strain and buffers were provided with the transformer site-directed mutagenesis kit (CLONTECH). Mutagenesis was performed on theSalI/XbaI fragment of hVAChT in pUC18. The mutagenic primer included two nucleotide changes in hVAChT (C1849 to T; C1852 to A) such that a silentBstBI restriction site was added. Transformants were screened by restriction analysis and verified by cDNA double-stranded sequencing using the Sequenase kit (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). The mutated SalI/XbaI fragment was then reintroduced into the hVAChT DNA. The BstBI-NotI fragments containing the cytoplasmic tails of hVAChT and hVMAT2 were then exchanged, and the chimeric cDNAs were subcloned into pRc/CMV for transfection into PC12 cells. Control and PC12 cell lines expressing hVAChT, hVMAT2, and the chimeras were grown to confluence, rinsed with PBS, collected in PBS containing 10 mm EDTA (pH 7.4), and centrifuged at 800 ×g for 10 min. The cell pellets were resuspended and homogenized (Dounce, type B pestle) in ice-cold buffer containing 110 mm potassium tartrate, 20 mm HEPES, 1 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm MgCl2, adjusted to pH 7.0 with KOH, and supplemented with a protease inhibitors mixture (0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mg/ml leupeptin, 2 mg/ml aprotinin, 2 mg/ml pepstatin). The nuclei and unbroken cells were spun out at 800 × g for 10 min, resuspended, homogenized, and spun as before. The two low speed supernatants were combined, and the protein content was measured using the Bradford assay (39Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 73: 248-254Crossref Scopus (216357) Google Scholar). The levels of expression of the human proteins were assessed on Western blot and with [3H]vesamicol (l-[piperidinyl-3,4-3H]vesamicol) and [3H]TBZOH (α-[O-methyl-3H]dihydrotetrabenazine) binding measurements. For [3H]vesamicol or [3H]TBZOH binding assays, aliquots of PNS (30 μg of protein in 50 μl) or aliquots of the fractions collected from glycerol gradients (50 ml) were mixed with buffer containing 20 mm potassium tartrate, 20 mm HEPES at pH 7.4 (50–100 μl), and various concentrations of [3H]vesamicol (31 Ci/mmol, NEN Life Science Products) or [3H]TBZOH (152 Ci/mmol, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After 1-h incubation at 20 °C, the reactions were stopped by vacuum filtration through GF/C glass fiber filters (Whatman) presoaked in 0.5% polyethyleneimine, followed by a 5-ml wash with ice-cold buffer containing 110 mm potassium tartrate and 20 mmHEPES (pH 7.4). Radioactivity bound to the filters was solubilized in 1 ml of 1% SDS and measured by scintillation counting in 10 ml of EcoScint (National Diagnostics). Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 30 μml-vesamicol or 1 μm unlabeled tetrabenazine and was subtracted from the total binding. For equilibrium density fractionation, a PNS (2–3 mg of protein) was loaded on a continuous 11-ml 0.6–1.6m (20–46%) sucrose gradient buffered with 20 mm HEPES (pH 7) for sedimentation at 40,000 rpm at 4 °C for 3 h in a SW40 rotor. Twelve 1-ml fractions were collected from the bottom using a fraction recovery system (Beckman). Glycerol velocity fractionation was performed according to the method described by Kelly and co-workers (40Grote E. Hao J.C. Bennett M.K. Kelly R.B. Cell. 1995; 81: 581-589Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) with minor modification. Briefly, the PNS was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min, and the resulting supernatant (about 2 mg of protein) was loaded onto a 4.6-ml 5–25% glycerol gradient prepared in homogenization buffer for a 45-min-long centrifugation at 55,000 rpm in a SW55 rotor. A first fraction equivalent to the volume-loaded, then successive 350-ml fractions, were collected from the top. The linearity of the gradients was verified by refractometry. Equal volumes of each gradient fraction were processed for Western blot analysis (41Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207200) Google Scholar). High speed pellets were prepared from diluted gradient fractions; the sucrose gradient fractions were brought to 320 mm sucrose with 20 mm HEPES (pH 7) and centrifuged for 3 h at 40,000 rpm in a Ti70.1 rotor, while the glycerol gradient fractions were diluted 5-fold in the same buffer and spun for 1 h at 100,000 rpm in a TLA100.2 rotor. Pellets were solubilized in sample buffer containing 62 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 5% SDS, and 50 mm dithiothreitol. Membrane proteins were separated on 8% polyacrylamide mini-gels and electrotransferred onto nitrocellulose (Hybond-ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). (CgB and p38 could also be detected on aliquots directly taken from gradient fractions and dissolved in sample buffer.) Following a 1-h preincubation in TBS (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) containing 5% non-fat dry milk, the blots were incubated for 2 h at room temperature with affinity-purified hVAChT or hVMAT2 antibodies (1 μg/ml), rVMAT1 antisera (1:500), anti-CgB (1/800), anti-p38 (1/5000), or anti-TFR (8 μg/ml) in TBS-1% bovine serum albumin. Bound primary antibodies were visualized using a monoclonal anti-rabbit antibody or a polyclonal anti-mouse antibody, each coupled to peroxidase (Sigma) and an ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Cells were plated on polyornithine (100 μg/ml)-coated glass coverslips and treated with NGF (50 ng/ml; Collaborative Biomedical Products) for 4 days. After fixation in 10% formalin/PBS, cells were washed extensively and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in 3% NGS/PBS. Double staining for the transporters and p38 was then performed using the affinity-purified anti-hVAChT or anti-hVMAT2 antisera (1 μg/ml) and anti-p38 (1/300) diluted in the blocking/permeabilization buffer. Primary antibodies were applied for 2 h at room temperature, then the cells were washed with PBS and incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-coupled goat anti-rabbit (1/80; Sigma) and tetramethylrhodamine B isothiocyante-coupled goat anti-mouse (1/128; Sigma) in 3% NGS/PBS, for 1 h at room. After final washes, the coverslips were mounted with Cytoseal 60 (Stephens Laboratories) and examined under epifluorescence. We used the method described by Tao-Cheng and co-workers (42Tanner V.A. Ploug T. Tao-Cheng J.-H. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1996; 44: 1481-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were grown on Matrigel (Collaborative Biomedical Products)-coated eight-well chamber slides and treated with NGF (50 ng/ml) for 14 days. Following fixation in 4% formaldehyde, 0.01% glutaraldehyde (hVAChT labeling) or 2% formaldehyde, 0.1% glutaraldehyde (hVMAT2 labeling), the preparations were washed extensively and stained for hVAChT or hVMAT2 using 3 μg/ml affinity-purified antibodies in 0.1% saponin, 5% NGS/PBS. A secondary anti-rabbit antibody coupled to a 1.4 nm gold particle (Nanoprobe) was applied thereafter and the particles amplified by silver enhancement (HQ kit, Nanoprobes). The human vesicular transporters could be distinguished from the endogenously expressed rVAChT or rVMAT1 in stably transfected PC12 cell lines using species-specific or isoform-specific antisera. In addition, the human proteins were assayed biochemically as the level of specific [3H]vesamicol binding is very low in naive PC12 cells (34Varoqui H. Erickson J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27229-27232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), and the VMAT2 isoform selectively binds TBZOH (35Erickson J.D. Schäfer M.K.-H. Bonner T.I. Eiden L.E. Weihe E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5166-5171Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). Chimeras of hVAChT and hVMAT2 in which the cytoplasmic tails were exchanged retained the ability to bind these specific inhibitors. The affinity of the V/2 chimera (Kd = 15 ± 3.4 nm; n = 3) for [3H]vesamicol was slightly lower than that of hVAChT (Kd = 4.2 ± 0.7 nm; n = 6) while the affinity of the 2/v chimera (Kd = 5.9 ± 0.3;n = 3) for [3H]TBZOH was not significantly different from that observed for hVMAT2 (Kd = 7.3 ± 0.3 nm;n = 3). The level of expression of hVAChT (Bmax = 7.4 ± 0.7 pmol/mg) was similar to that of hVMAT2 (Bmax = 5.0 ± 1.2 pmol/mg) and approximately four to five times higher than levels of expression of the chimeras (2/v; Bmax = 1.6 ± 0.5 pmol/mg and V/2; Bmax = 1.3 ± 0.4 pmol/mg). This difference in levels of wild-type versuschimeric protein expression was considered advantageous considering the reported saturability of the protein machinery for synaptic vesicle biogenesis (43Grote E. Kelly R.B. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 537-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). To characterize the subcellular distribution of hVAChT and hVMAT2 in PC12 cells, we have fractionated the cells by equilibrium sedimentation through sucrose density gradients (Fig. 1). Immunoblots of the fractions stained with antibodies to chromogranin B (CgB), a soluble protein of LDCVs, and p38 indicated that these proteins predominantly reside as expected in the heavier LDCV and lighter synaptic vesicle fractions of the gradient. In addition, the antipeptide antibody to the endogenous rVMAT1 detected immunoreactive material migrating in the heavy fractions containing CgB. When these immunoblots were stained with antibodies directed against hVMAT2 and hVAChT, these proteins predominantly reside in LDCV- and synaptic vesicle-containing fractions of the gradient, respectively. To localize the hVAChT immunoreactivity that appeared in lighter density fractions on the sucrose gradient, we have used glycerol gradients that separate by sedimentation rate and not by equilibrium density (Fig. 2). Furthermore, velocity sedimentation through glycerol enables separation of endosomal membranes from synaptic vesicles (26Clift-O'Grady L. Linstedt A.D. Lowe A.W. Grote E. Kelly R.B. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 1693-1703Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). We found that when high speed supernatants of PC12 cells were centrifuged through glycerol, hVAChT sedimented in synaptic vesicle fractions containing p38. The transferrin receptor (TFR) also shuttles between early endosomes and the plasma membrane in PC12 cells. However, the endosomal membranes containing the TFR were excluded from fractions containing synaptic vesicles. A large fraction of the p38 and VAChT in PC12 cells was present in fractions that also contain the transferrin receptor and is consistent with the model that PC12 synaptic vesicles bud from endosomes (31Cameron P.L. Südhof T.C. Jahn R. De Camilli P. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 151-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 44Linstedt A.D. Kelly R.B.

EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3589-3601Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). PC12 cells were treated with NGF to induce formation of neural processes. Morphologic examination of hVAChT and hVMAT2 expression of NGF-treated PC12 cells (4 days) by light microscopy and immunofluorescence revealed co-localization of hVAChT and p38 and a distinct pattern of distribution for hVMAT2 (Fig. 3). Double staining with antibodies to hVAChT and p38 showed intense perinuclear localization which was not observed for hVMAT2. Immunoelectron microscopic analysis was performed on cultures of cells treated with NGF for prolonged periods of time (14 days) to generate synaptic vesicle clusters (42Tanner V.A. Ploug T. Tao-Cheng J.-H. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1996; 44: 1481-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, an abundance of hVAChT-immunoreactive gold particles was observed on synaptic vesicles, while hVMAT2 was relatively excluded from these organelles (Fig. 4).Figure 4Localization of hVAChT and 2/v chimera to synaptic vesicle clusters. NGF-treated (14 days), stably transfected PC12-cells were fixed and processed for pre-embedding immunoelectron microscopy. The hVAChT, hVMAT2, and 2/v chimera were visualized using affinity-purified antisera (anti-hVAChT or anti-hVMAT2), 1.4-nm gold particle-coupled anti-rabbit antibody and silver enhancement.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Since hVAChT and hVMAT2 contain information within their primary sequences that selectively target them different secretory organelles in PC12 cells, chimeric molecules can be used to identify the relevant sorting domains. Fractionation of cells expressing chimeras of hVAChT and hVMAT2 in which the entire cytoplasmic tail of these proteins was switched revealed a marked shift in their subcellular distribution. When hVAChT contained the cytoplasmic tail of hVMAT2 (V/2 chimera), its distribution on sucrose density gradients was more similar to that observed for CgB or hVMAT2 than that seen with hVAChT or p38, although some immunoreactivity in intermediate fractions was also seen (Fig. 1). The V/2 chimera was excluded from p38 containing synaptic vesicle fractions on glycerol gradients, indicating that the cytoplasmic tail of hVAChT was necessary for synaptic vesicle targeting (Fig. 2). On the other hand, when the hVMAT2 protein had the cytoplasmic tail of hVAChT (2/v chimera), it co-localized in equilibrium density and glycerol velocity gradient fractions that contain p38, as was observed for hVAChT (Figs.1 and 2). Likewise, the immunocytochemical and electron microscopic distribution of the 2/v chimera resembled hVAChT with intense perinuclear co-localization with p38 (Fig. 3) and presence on synaptic vesicle clusters in NGF-treated cultures (Fig. 4). A further evaluation of the shift in the expression of hVMAT2 from LDCVs to synaptic vesicles due to the presence of the cytoplasmic tail of hVAChT was performed by analyzing the binding of [3H]TBZOH and [3H]vesamicol on membrane fractions from NGF-treated cultures obtained following centrifugation through glycerol (Fig. 5). Synaptic vesicle fractions containing hVAChT could selectively bind high levels of [3H] vesamicol. However, the binding of [3H]TBZOH to synaptic vesicle fractions collected from hVMAT2-expressing cells was low. On the other hand, the binding of [3H]TBZOH to synaptic vesicle fractions containing the 2/v chimera was similar to the level of [3H]vesamicol binding to hVAChT. The binding recovered in the synaptic vesicle fractions represents approximately 13, 3, and 25% of the total binding for hVAChT, hVMAT2, and 2/v chimera, respectively. Thus, while the total level of hVMAT2 expression is more than three times greater than that of the 2/v chimera in the stably transfected cells, the amount of [3H]TBZOH binding to the 2/v chimera in the synaptic vesicle fractions is considerable higher (approximately 4-fold) than that recovered for hVMAT2. These data indicate that the presence of cytoplasmic tail of hVAChT was sufficient for synaptic vesicle targeting of hVMAT2. The trafficking of vesicular transporters into regulatedversus constitutive vesicles and mechanisms of sorting and recycling of regulated secretory organelles can be studied using PC12 cells that express both LDCV and synaptic vesicle proteins. To identify the domain of VAChT, which is required for its preferential targeting to the cholinergic vesicles in PC12 cells, we have (i) examined the steady-state distribution of stably expressed hVAChT and hVMAT2 and found that they differentially sort to synaptic vesicles and LDCVs and (ii) demonstrated that the cytoplasmic domain of hVAChT is necessary for its expression on synaptic vesicles and sufficient to redirect the expression of hVMAT2 from LDCVs to synaptic vesicles. We have shown previously that the endogenously expressed rVAChT is localized to synaptic vesicle clusters in NGF-treated PC12 cells (27Erickson J.D. Weihe E. Schäfer M.K.-H. Neale E. Williamson L. Bonner T.I. Tao-Cheng J.-H. Eiden L.E. Prog. Brain Res. 1996; 109: 69-82Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,28Weihe E. Tao-Cheng J.-H. Schäfer M.K.-H. Erickson J.D. Eiden L.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3547-3552Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). The localization of hVAChT also to synaptic vesicles in PC12 cells indicates that VAChT contains within its primary amino acid sequence information important for its selective targeting. On the other hand, hVMAT2 is preferentially targeted to LDCVs when expressed in PC12 cells. The localization of VMAT2 to LDCVs in PC12 cells suggests that the sorting mechanisms for VMAT2 are similar to those of VMAT1 and that information required for targeting to DCVs may be contained within regions of the VMAT molecule that are common to both VMAT1 and VMAT2. The soluble proteins and membrane-associated proteins that are absent from the constitutive pathway and synaptic vesicles are thought to sort into the regulated pathway through aggregation at thetrans-Golgi (47Burgess T.L. Kelly R.B. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1987; 3: 243-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (750) Google Scholar). LDCV targeting information may therefore be in the luminal portion of the VMAT molecules as is the case for peptidyl-amidating monooxygenase, a type 1 membrane protein that is found in several forms, including a soluble variant (48Milgram S.L. Johnson R.C. Mains R.E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 717-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The lumenal glycosylated loop of hVMAT2 does not interfere with the targeting to synaptic vesicles though when it is present in a hVAChT chimera. 2H. Varoqui and J. D. Erickson, unpublished observation. Information affecting internalization from the plasma membrane may be found in cytoplasmic domains as has been observed for peptidyl-amidating monooxygenase and other exogenous granular membrane proteins such as P-selectin and furin when they are expressed in PC12 cells (49Disdier M. Morrissey J.H. Fugate R.D. Bainton D.F. McEver R.P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 309-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 50Milgram S.L. Mains R.E. Eipper B.A. J.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4961-4975Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Immunogold labeling of VMAT2 in the monoaminergic rat solitary tract nuclei has revealed its expression on both DCVs and synaptic vesicles (17Nirenberg M.J. Liu Y. Peter D. Edwards R.H. Pickel V.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8773-8777Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The absence of VMAT2 from synaptic vesicles in transfected PC12 cells suggests that PC12 cells lack some component that is required for VMAT2 targeting to synaptic vesicles. Indeed, SDCVs, the small synaptic vesicles of monoaminergic neurons, may be a third type of regulated secretory vesicle which is absent in PC12 cells (6Bauerfeind R. Jelinek R. Hellwig A. Huttner W.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7342-7346Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). While studies of synaptic vesicle biogenesis in PC12 cells have led to the conclusion that p38 trafficks from the trans-Golgi to the cell surface via a constitutive vesicle, it is not known whether VAChT trafficks via this route or by some other organelle, such as the LDCV. Some VAChT-asssociated gold particles are observed on LDCVs along the fibers of control and hVAChT-expressing PC12 cells (11Varoqui H. Erickson J.D. Mol. Neurobiol. 1997; 15: 165-191Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 54Tao-Cheng J.-H. Eiden L.E. Adv. Pharmacol. 1997; 42: 250-253Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar). This suggests that VAChT may initially be targeted to immature DCVs at thetrans-Golgi and during LDCV maturation is selectively removed. However, LDCVs are the majority of vesicles observed in PC12 cells, in contrast to the situation in cholinergic nerves in vivo, where synaptic vesicles predominate. In cholinergic nerves, ACh and neuropeptides are differentially released, reflecting the fact that they are stored in synaptic vesicles and LDCVs, respectively (8Matteoli M. Haimann C. Torri-Tarelli F. Polak J.M. Ceccarelli B. De Camilli P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7366-7370Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar,55Agoston D.V. Conlon J.M. Whittaker V.P. Exp. Brain Res. 1988; 72: 535-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Synaptic vesicle membrane proteins may have at least two distinct targeting signals that act sequentially: a plasma membrane internalization signal and a signal for sorting from the endosome to the synaptic vesicle. The information required for endocytosis of p38 lies in its cytoplasmic domain (56Linstedt A.D. Kelly R.B. J. Physiol. (Paris). 1991; 85: 90-96PubMed Google Scholar), but a synaptic vesicle sorting signal has not been identified. Synaptic vesicle biogenesis at the endosome has been suggested to be a result of selective association of synaptic vesicle proteins with one another to form an aggregate that excludes other membrane proteins (26Clift-O'Grady L. Linstedt A.D. Lowe A.W. Grote E. Kelly R.B. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 1693-1703Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Proteins in such aggregates might then bud off from the endosomal membranes into vesicles of the correct dimensions. Kelly and co-workers (40Grote E. Hao J.C. Bennett M.K. Kelly R.B. Cell. 1995; 81: 581-589Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) have suggested that VAMP-2 (synaptobrevin) is targeted to synaptic vesicles in PC12 cells by associating, via a hydrophobic amphipathic helix in the cytoplasmic domain, with other synaptic vesicle membrane proteins. In the case of VAMP-2, this synaptic vesicle targeting signal is also used for endocytosis (43Grote E. Kelly R.B. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 537-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The targeting of VAChT to synaptic vesicles in PC12 cells may occur by interaction of the cytoplasmic tail with specific escort proteins of a novel protein-sorting machinery. Several conserved amino acid residues within the cytoplasmic tail of hVAChT (dileucine and tyrosine-based motifs and putative serine phosphorylation site) are potential candidates (Fig. 6) for endocytosis and/or synaptic vesicle targeting signals (57Trowbridge I.S. Collawn J.F. Hopkins C.R. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 129-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar, 58Marks M.S. Woodruff L. Ohno H. Bonifacino J.S. J.

Future experiments will be directed toward the identification of a specific synaptic vesicle targeting motif within the cytoplasmic tail of VAChT and whether there is overlap with the signal for endocytosis.

https://openalex.org/W1964710104,"The CYP monooxygenase, CYP2B12, is the first identified skin-specific cytochrome P450 enzyme. It is characterized by high, constitutive expression in an extrahepatic tissue, the sebaceous glands of cutaneous tissues. It is expressed exclusively in a subset of differentiated keratinocytes called sebocytes, as demonstrated by Northern blot analysis, in situ hybridization, and polymerase chain reaction. The onset of its expression coincides with the morphological appearance of sebaceous glands in the neonatal rat. Recombinant CYP2B12 produced in Escherichia coli epoxidizes arachidonic acid to 11,12- and 8,9-epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (80 and 20% of total metabolites, respectively). The identification of arachidonic acid as a substrate for this skin-specific CYP monooxygenase suggests an endogenous function in keratinocytes in the generation of bioactive lipids and intracellular signaling. The CYP monooxygenase, CYP2B12, is the first identified skin-specific cytochrome P450 enzyme.

It is expressed exclusively in a subset of differentiated keratinocytes called sebocytes, as demonstrated by Northern blot analysis, in situ hybridization, and polymerase chain reaction. The onset of its expression coincides with the morphological appearance of sebaceous glands in the neonatal rat. Recombinant CYP2B12 produced in Escherichia coli epoxidizes arachidonic acid to 11,12- and 8,9-epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (80 and 20% of total metabolites, respectively). The identification of arachidonic acid as a substrate for this skin-specific CYP monooxygenase suggests an endogenous function in keratinocytes in the generation of bioactive lipids and intracellular signaling. Mammalian CYP monooxygenases (CYP gene superfamily) oxidatively metabolize small, hydrophobic compounds, including steroids, sterols, fatty acids, fat-soluble vitamins, drugs, and toxins (1Nebert D.W. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 1203-1214Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). These enzymes are expressed in most mammalian tissues, where they function in the biosynthesis or catabolism of endogenous and exogenous substrates. Members of the CYP2B gene subfamily are often called phenobarbital-inducible cytochrome P450 enzymes because phenobarbital treatment results in transcriptional activation of certain hepatic CYP2B genes (2Henderson C.J. Wolf C.R. Prog. Drug Metab. 1992; 13: 73-139Google Scholar). A typical CYP2B monooxygenase has 16-hydroxylase activity with androgenic steroids, such as testosterone, and is expressed in the liver and organs such as kidney, lung, and testis (2Henderson C.J. Wolf C.R. Prog. Drug Metab. 1992; 13: 73-139Google Scholar). CYP2B12 has long been known to be an unusual member of theCYP2B gene subfamily. The gene encoding this enzyme (CYP2B12) was discovered by Atchison and Adesnik (3Atchison M. Adesnik M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 2300-2304Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Originally called gene 4, it was one of several partial genomic clones that proved the multiplicity of the CYP2B gene subfamily. Gene 4 expression was not detected in the liver or other organs but rather in preputial glands (4Friedberg T. Grassow M.A. Bartlomowicz-Oesch B. Siegert P. Arand M. Adesnik M. Oesch F. Biochem. J. 1992; 287: 775-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), the large, paired sebaceous glands beneath the genital skin in rodents. This finding led Friedberget al. (4Friedberg T. Grassow M.A. Bartlomowicz-Oesch B. Siegert P. Arand M. Adesnik M. Oesch F. Biochem. J. 1992; 287: 775-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) to isolate and characterize a full-length cDNA corresponding to gene 4 from a preputial gland cDNA library. More than 10 years after its discovery, the novel cytochrome P450 named CYP2B12 is now recognized as the first identified skin-specific cytochrome P450 enzyme. CYP2B12 has remained enigmatic not only for its restricted tissue-specific expression but also because its substrate was not identified. No activity could be demonstrated with preputial gland microsomes using typical CYP2B substrates, such as testosterone, androstenedione, benzphetamine, and ethoxy-, pentoxy-, and benzoyresorufin (2Henderson C.J. Wolf C.R. Prog. Drug Metab. 1992; 13: 73-139Google Scholar, 4Friedberg T. Grassow M.A. Bartlomowicz-Oesch B. Siegert P. Arand M. Adesnik M. Oesch F. Biochem. J. 1992; 287: 775-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Our preliminary investigations of a novel CYP2B in mouse skin 1D. S. Keeney, C. Skinner, and M. R. Waterman, unpublished data. having sequence homology to rat CYP2B12 renewed interest in this cutaneous P450 enzyme. We report here that CYP2B12 is a gene product unique to sebocytes, a subset of differentiated keratinocytes, and that arachidonate is a substrate for CYP2B12. It is hypothesized that the epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) 2The abbreviations used are: EET, epoxyeicosatrienoic acid; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; HPLC,high performance liquid chromatography; NICI/GC/MS, negative ion chemical ionization-gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy; PFB, pentafluorobenzyl; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; RT, reverse transcription; bp, base pair(s). produced by this enzyme may function in signal transduction pathways essential for establishing or maintaining the differentiated phenotype of keratinocytes in cutaneous tissues. Total RNA was isolated by a modification of the method of Chomczynski and Sacchi as described (5Keeney D.S. Ikeda Y. Waterman M.R. Parker K.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1091-1098PubMed Google Scholar), with the following changes: cutaneous tissues were frozen in liquid nitrogen, pulverized with a mortar and pestle, dissolved in guanidinium thiocyanate solution, and sheared with a 25 gauge needle. For Northern analysis, total RNA was size-fractionated on formaldehyde-containing 1% agarose gels and transferred by capillarity to GeneScreen Plus membranes (DuPont). Membranes were baked at 80 °C and stained with methylene blue to assess RNA integrity. Hybridization was carried out overnight with a 32P-labeled cDNA encoding 3′-untranslated sequences of CYP2B12 (570 bp; GenBank accession no.X63545) or CYP2B15 (260 bp; GenBank accession no. D17349). These fragments were generated by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) from rat skin RNA using oligonucleotides 1 and 2 for CYP2B12 or oligonucleotides 3 and 4 for CYP2B15 (TableI). Hybridized membranes were washed stringently and exposed to autoradiographic film. For RT-PCR, an RNA PCR kit (Perkin-Elmer) was used according to the manufacturer's instructions, with total RNA as template. Oligonucleotides contained in exons 4 and 9 (Table I, oligonucleotides 5 and 6) were used to determine the tissue distribution of CYP2B12 transcripts. Thus, products amplified from RNA (920 bp) or genomic DNA could be distinguished. The PCR products were size-fractionated on agarose gels and visualized with ethidium bromide. To survey expression of putative CYP epoxygenases in sebaceous tissues by RT-PCR, the following primers (Table I) were used: 1) CYP1A subfamily-specific (oligonucleotides 7 and 8); 2) CYP2B subfamily-specific (oligonucleotides 9 and 10); and 3) CYP3A subfamily-specific (oligonucleotides 11 and 12). Two primer pairs were used in the same reaction to achieve consensus for mammalian CYP2C subfamily members (oligonucleotides 13–16). Finally, two pairs of oligonucleotides were used to detect expression of CYP2E1 (oligonucleotides 17 and 18) and CYP2J3 (oligonucleotides 19 and 20).Table ISummary of oligonucleotides used in this study (5′ → 3′)OligonucleotideSequence1SenseTGCTGTGAGTCTAGAAGAGCA2AntisenseGCCAGCATTAAAGATCATGTCG3SenseCACAGTCACACACCTTCACAG4AntisenseAGTGAGCTCAAGACCA(G/A)CCAG5SenseGGATCTAGTCTATAAGACATCTGT6AntisenseGACACGTCATTCCATTGACTCTT7SenseT(G/C)AG(C/T)(G/C)GCCTG(G/A)ACACCAT8AntisenseCTGTG(G/C)GGIATGGTGAA(T/G)G9SenseCTGCTCCAT(T/C)GT(G/C)TTTGGA10Antisense(A/G)ATCACCTGITC(A/G)ATCTCC11SenseCAGCATGGA(T/C)GTGAT(C/T)AC12AntisenseGCAAACCTCAT(G/T)(C/T)CAA(T/G)GC13SenseTGTGCTCCI(G/T)GCAATGT(G/C)AT14AntisenseATCTC(T/C)TCCTG(C/G)ACTTTA(G/T)C15SenseTG(C/T)TCC(C/T)T(C/G)CAA(T/C)(G/C)TGATCT16AntisenseAAGTAGTC(T/A)(G/C)TCTTCTT(G/A)AAG17SenseCACCTTCAGTCACTGGACATCAAC18AntisenseCATGCACCACAGCATCCATGTAG19SenseGACAGTCAGTTTCAGGAGATGCTG20AntisenseGATGTTGCCTATTCTCTGCACCTC21SenseGGTTAGACCAGGACCATGGCTCTGTTATTAGCAGTTCTCCTCACTCTCACTGTGGGCTTCTTGCTA22AntisenseCTGGTTCGGCCCATCTCCACA(C/A)TATGG(G/C)CAATGTA Open table in a new tab Sprague-Dawley rats were obtained from Harlan Sprague-Dawley and handled according to protocols approved by Vanderbilt University. Whole skin samples were immersion-fixed for 24 h in 4% buffered paraformaldehyde. Tissue preparation and in situ hybridization were done as described (5Keeney D.S. Ikeda Y. Waterman M.R. Parker K.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1091-1098PubMed Google Scholar). [35S-UTP]cRNAs were produced by in vitrotranscription from a 570-bp fragment of CYP2B12 (described above). Specific hybridization was distinguished by comparing silver grain development produced by sense and antisense cRNAs applied to consecutive sections on the same slide. A CYP2B12 cDNA (4Friedberg T. Grassow M.A. Bartlomowicz-Oesch B. Siegert P. Arand M. Adesnik M. Oesch F. Biochem. J. 1992; 287: 775-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) (pBS2B12) was modified and subcloned into pKK233–2 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) to make the expression construct pKK2B12, similar to the method of John et al. (6John G.H. Hasler J.A. He Y. Halpert J.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 314: 367-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), who used pKK233–2 successfully to express several CYP2B enzymes in E. coli. Briefly, a 1.6 kb fragment of pBS2B12, containing all but 83 bp of 5′-coding sequence, was isolated by restriction with XbaI, digestion with Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I to produce a blunt end, and then restriction with NcoI. This fragment was purified and ligated into pKK233–2. Before replacing the missing 83 bp 5′-end of CYP2B12, the native N-terminal sequence MEFGVLL was changed to MALLLAV by PCR mutagenesis as described (6John G.H. Hasler J.A. He Y. Halpert J.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 314: 367-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 7Barnes H.J. Arlotto M.P. Waterman M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5597-5601Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar), using oligonucleotides 21 and 22 (Table I). The PCR product containing this N-terminal modification was restricted with NcoI, producing the missing 83-bp fragment, and ligated into pKK2B12 construct above. By DNA sequence analysis, this final pKK2B12 expression construct contained the entire open reading frame of CYP2B12, the MALLLAV N-terminal modification, and 40 bp of untranslated sequence beyond the stop codon. Competent E. coli cells (Topp3 strain; Stratagene) were transformed with pKK2B12. Media and conditions for expression were as described (8Sandu P. Baba T. Guengerich F.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 306: 443-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The cultures were harvested after 48–72 h at 30 °C at 200 rpm. Typical yields were ≥500 nmol of P450/liter of culture by whole cell spectral assay. Whole cells or cellular fractions were diluted in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer containing 20% glycerol to measure CO difference spectra (9Omura T. Sato R. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 2379-2385Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Bacterial membranes solubilized with CHAPS detergent were prepared as described (6John G.H. Hasler J.A. He Y. Halpert J.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 314: 367-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) for metabolism studies. CYP2B12 activity was assayed as described (10Capdevila J.H. Falck J.R. Dishman E. Karara A. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 187: 385-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Briefly, CHAPS-solubilized E. coli membranes were incubated at 30 °C with purified rat NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase (molar ratio of P450:reductase, 1:5) in the presence ofl-α-dilauroyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine and a NADPH regenerating system. After 1 min equilibration at 30 °C, [1-14C]arachidonic acid was added (50 μCi/μmol; final concentration, 50–75 μm), and the reaction was initiated with NADPH (final concentration, 1 mm). At various time points, the reaction mixtures were extracted with ethyl ether, and the organic extracts were resolved by reversed phase HPLC with on-line liquid scintillation detection (Radiomatic Flo-One β-detector; Radiomatic Instruments). For product structural analyses, CYP2B12 was reconstituted in the presence of NADPH and 70 μm[1-14C]arachidonic acid (0.2–0.4 μCi/μmol). Radioactive fractions with retention times corresponding to those of authentic 5,6-, 8,9-, and 11,12-EET were collected, and individual EET regioisomers were resolved by normal phase HPLC as described (10Capdevila J.H. Falck J.R. Dishman E. Karara A. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 187: 385-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 11Capdevila J.H. Dishman E. Karara A. Falck J.R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 206: 441-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Purified EET regioisomers were converted to the corresponding pentafluorobenzyl (PFB) esters, and their optical antipodes were resolved by chiral phase HPLC as described (11Capdevila J.H. Dishman E. Karara A. Falck J.R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 206: 441-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 12Hammonds T.D. Blair I.A. Falck J.R. Capdevila J.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 300-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Aliquots of purified EET-PFB regioisomers were analyzed by negative ion chemical ionization-gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy (NICI/GC/MS) as described (11Capdevila J.H. Dishman E. Karara A. Falck J.R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 206: 441-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Endogenous EET was measured in freshly isolated rat preputial and clitoral glands. Homogenized tissue was extracted in the presence of triphenylphosphine and analyzed as described by NICI/GC/MS (11Capdevila J.H. Dishman E. Karara A. Falck J.R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 206: 441-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The tissue content of 8,9-, 11,12-, and 14,15-EET was estimated, but 5,6-EET is too labile to be detected (11Capdevila J.H. Dishman E. Karara A. Falck J.R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 206: 441-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). CYP2B12 is a cutaneous monooxygenase expressed constitutively in rat preputial gland (the tissue source from which a full-length CYP2B12 cDNA was isolated) (4Friedberg T. Grassow M.A. Bartlomowicz-Oesch B. Siegert P. Arand M. Adesnik M. Oesch F. Biochem. J. 1992; 287: 775-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Among cutaneous tissues, the single most enriched source of CYP2B12 mRNA is the pair of preputial (male) or clitoral (female) (Fig. 1) glands in the rat. These large, paired sebaceous glands in the genital skin are readily dissected free of surrounding cutaneous tissue and subcutaneous fat. As such, they are composed nearly exclusively of keratinocytes at different stages of differentiation. Although CYP2B12 transcripts were detectable in all cutaneous tissues examined, transcript abundance varied. Among samples of full-thickness skin, tail and anogenital skin showed a relatively high level of expression. Lower levels were found in the abdominal skin, ear, and foot pad. For these latter samples, visible bands of the expected molecular size appeared after longer exposure times than that shown in Fig. 1. The differences in hybridization signal intensity among cutaneous tissues appeared to be proportional to the relative size and abundance of sebaceous glands observed morphologically. By Northern blot analysis, CYP2B12 mRNA was undetectable in the liver, lung, kidney, testis, adrenal gland, and intestinal mucosa (4Friedberg T. Grassow M.A. Bartlomowicz-Oesch B. Siegert P. Arand M. Adesnik M. Oesch F. Biochem. J. 1992; 287: 775-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). The tissue-specificity of CYP2B12 gene expression was investigated further by the highly sensitive RT-PCR technique. Using total RNA as template, no product of the expected size could be detected in the following noncutaneous tissues of the rat: liver, kidney, lung, heart, adipose, spleen, uterus, ovary, adrenal glands, and tongue (not shown). The positive control, clitoral gland RNA, was amplified only when reverse transcriptase was included in the reaction mixture. These results indicate that CYP2B12 is truly a cutaneous monooxygenase. In situ hybridization was used to identify the cutaneous cell type(s) expressing CYP2B12. CYP2B12 antisense cRNA hybridized specifically to preputial gland acini containing sebaceous keratinocytes. Acini are shown in Fig. 2, A and B, surrounding a central collecting duct, which directs the flow of sebum to the skin surface. At higher magnification (not shown), silver grains localized specifically to sebocytes, the terminally differentiated keratinocytes in this gland, but not to undifferentiated keratinocytes at the periphery of individual acini or any other cutaneous tissue. Reproducible epidermal expression was not observed in situ, although a very low level of expression in epidermal keratinocytes cannot be ruled out. CYP2B12 transcripts also localized to sebocytes in other types of sebaceous glands, for example, the Meibomian glands in the eyelid (not shown), anal glands in anogenital skin (not shown), and sebaceous glands associated with hair follicles. In hair follicles (Fig. 2, C and D), CYP2B12 antisense cRNA localized to sebocytes but not to keratinocytes making up the hair follicle root sheath, epidermis, or other cutaneous structures. During postnatal development, the onset of expression of CYP2B12 coincides with the morphological appearance of well-developed sebaceous glands in both sexes (not shown). These data demonstrate that expression of this cutaneous cytochrome P450 enzyme is restricted to a subset of differentiated keratinocytes found in sebaceous glands. Differentiated keratinocytes are responsible for producing the unusual lipids found in the epidermal water permeability barrier and sebum (13Nicolaides N. Science. 1974; 186: 19-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). Because CYP2B12 is expressed constitutively in lipid-laden sebocytes, it seemed plausible that its endogenous substrate(s) would be lipids. To test this hypothesis, recombinant CYP2B12 was produced in E. coliafter its first seven amino acids were replaced with the sequence MALLLAV (7Barnes H.J. Arlotto M.P. Waterman M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5597-5601Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar). The DNA sequence of this bacterial expression construct, pKK2B12, was compared with the CYP2B12 cDNA in GenBank (4Friedberg T. Grassow M.A. Bartlomowicz-Oesch B. Siegert P. Arand M. Adesnik M. Oesch F. Biochem. J. 1992; 287: 775-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Except for the deliberate N-terminal modification, only one difference was found in the nucleotide sequence (ATT → AGT) that would lead to an amino acid change at residue 476 (Ile → Ser). At this residue, the sequence of pKK2B12 agreed with that obtained by sequencing RT-PCR products amplified from rat preputial gland RNA. Reconstituted, recombinant CYP2B12 was active with [14C]arachidonic acid as substrate. Shown in Fig. 3 A, metabolism generated, in a NADPH-dependent manner, a major radioactive fraction eluting at 24 min. This fraction had a retention time similar to that of authentic 11,12-EET; radioactivity eluting at 34 min represents unmetabolized substrate. Production of the metabolites contained in this fraction was specific for pKK2B12 transformants because no metabolites were observed with membranes isolated from untransformedE. coli cells (Fig. 3 B). CYP2B12 substrate specificity was also demonstrated by its lack of catalytic activity toward the short chain fatty acid laurate (C12:0) (not shown). Metabolites eluting at 24 min (Fig. 3 A) were pooled and resolved by normal phase HPLC into two radioactive fractions having the same retention times as authentic 11,12- and 8,9-EET (Fig. 4). These two EETs were the sole reaction products observed, with 11,12- and 8,9-EET accounting for 80 and 20% of total metabolites, respectively. TableII shows the chiral analysis of these products. Both EETs were produced in an enantioselective fashion. The predominant enantiomers generated by CYP2B12 were 11(S),12(R)- and 8(R),9(S)-EET. The stereochemistry of 11,12-EET in Table II is similar to that found endogenously in rat liver (14Capdevila J.H. Zeldin D. Karara A. Falck J.R. Adv. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 14: 317-339Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar), further evidence that the function of CYP2B12 is metabolism of arachidonic acid.Figure 4Resolution of EET regioisomers generated by recombinant CYP2B12. The metabolites eluting at 24 min in Fig. 3 A were resolved by normal phase HPLC into two EET regioisomers that eluted with retention times identical to authentic 11,12- and 8,9-EET standards.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Table IIRegio- and stereochemical composition of epoxyeicosatrienoic acids produced from [14C]arachidonic acid by recombinant CYP2B12RegioisomerTotal EET metabolitesEnantioselectivityR, SS, R%14,15-EETND2-2001ND, not detected.11,12-EET8030708,9-EET2061395,6-EETND2-2001 ND, not detected. Open table in a new tab Structures of the 11,12- and 8,9-EET metabolites were confirmed by NICI/GC/MS. A mass spectral fragmentation pattern for the 11,12-EET-PFB is shown (Fig. 5). Major negative ions were as follows: m/z 319 (loss of the PFB from the molecule), m/z 321 (loss the PFB from the isotopically labeled molecule), and m/z 301 and 303 (loss of PFB, H2O, and oxygen). Similar results were obtained for the purified 8,9-EET produced by CYP2B12 (not shown). The fragmentation patterns are consistent with those of authentic EETs (11Capdevila J.H. Dishman E. Karara A. Falck J.R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 206: 441-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). These data demonstrate for the first time that arachidonic acid is a substrate for CYP2B12 and that the regiospecific metabolism by CYP2B12 is unlike most arachidonate (CYP) epoxygenases, which typically produce several EET regioisomers as major products (14Capdevila J.H. Zeldin D. Karara A. Falck J.R. Adv. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 14: 317-339Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Endogenous EETs were measured in freshly isolated rat preputial and clitoral glands using a quantitative mass spectral assay (11Capdevila J.H. Dishman E. Karara A. Falck J.R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 206: 441-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). From 5.7 g of sebaceous tissue, 202 ng of EET were recovered; 49% (98 ng) was 14,15-EET, 25% (51 ng) was 11,12-EET, and 26% (52 ng) was 8,9-EET. These results indicate the presence of another epoxygenase(s) because recombinant CYP2B12 produced 11,12-EET nearly exclusively. Although the fraction of EETs generated by CYP2B12 in sebaceous tissue cannot be determined, one possibility is that CYP2B12 contributes a major fraction of 11,12-EET. However, another epoxygenase(s) must be responsible for generating a major fraction of total EETs. The identity of other CYP epoxygenases in rat preputial/clitoral glands was explored using RT-PCR and DNA sequencing, whereas the relative abundance of specific transcripts was evaluated by Northern blot analysis or in situ hybridization. CYP1A and CYP3A subfamily-specific oligonucleotides yielded no PCR product. CYP2C subfamily-specific oligonucleotides yielded very faint bands of predicted size, negligible compared with the large amount of product from CYP2B subfamily-specific primers (not shown). CYP2C PCR products were not sequenced because of their low abundance. Sequencing of CYP2B PCR products indicated the presence of CYP2B1/2B2 mRNAs, but the levels in rat skin were too low to be detected by in situhybridization. In situ hybridization is more sensitive than Northern analysis. In addition to CYP2B12, which is a major transcript (Fig. 1), and low levels of CYP2B1/2B2, CYP2B15 (15Nakayama K. Suwa Y. Mizukami Y. Sogawa K. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Gene. 1993; 136: 333-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) was the third transcript detected in rat sebaceous RNA. CYP2B15 is a major transcript (Fig. 6) that appears to be expressed at levels comparable to CYP2B12, in the same tissues. In situhybridization studies (not shown) show that CYP2B15 is co-expressed with CYP2B12 in sebocytes. Although the activity of CYP2B15 is not known, we believe that this enzyme will prove to be an epoxygenase. This hypothesis is based on unpublished data1 suggesting that CYP2B15 is orthologous to murine CYP2B19, a novel keratinocyte-specific CYP2B in mouse skin having epoxygenase activity with arachidonic acid. Hence, we predict that CYP2B12 and CYP2B15 will be the major epoxygenases in rat sebaceous tissues. Two other CYP2 monooxygenases (CYP2E1 and CYP2J3) having epoxygenase activity (Table III) were detected in preputial/clitoral gland RNA by RT-PCR. Sequence analysis revealed the presence of authentic CYP2E1 and CYP2J3 mRNAs, as well as a novel CYP2J sequence that was 83% identical to both CYP2J3 (16Wu S. Chen W. Murphy E. Gabel S. Tomer K.B.

By Northern analysis, CYP2E1 and CYP2J3 mRNAs were not detected in clitoral gland RNA after membranes were exposed to film for 2 days (compared with <20 h for Figs. 1 and 6), indicating a low level of constitutive expression (not shown).Table IIIRegioselectivity of purified CYP2 family arachidonic acid epoxygenasesCYP geneSpeciesRegioisomers producedRef.14,15-EET11,12-EET8,9-EET5,6-EET%3-2001% of total.

Open table in a new tab In summary, these data demonstrate that CYP2B12 is a major epoxygenase in rat sebaceous tissue, but at least one other major epoxygenase must be present. We predict that the second epoxygenase will prove to be CYP2B15. Furthermore, CYP1A, CYP2C, and CYP3A transcripts are low or undetectable in rat sebaceous glands. CYP2B1/2B2, CYP2E1, and CYP2J3 transcripts are detectable, but constitutive expression is very low compared with that of CYP2B12 and CYP2B15. The expression pattern of CYP2B12 is highly unusual compared with other CYP2B genes. First, it shows high, constitutive expression in an extrahepatic tissue. Second, it is expressed in a single cell type: differentiated keratinocytes. As shown by in situ hybridization, it is restricted to a subset of differentiated keratinocytes called sebocytes. As demonstrated by Northern blot analysis, in situ hybridization, and RT-PCR, the singular cell type specificity of this cutaneous cytochrome P450 has few parallels in the CYP gene superfamily. Third, the ontogeny of CYP2B12 gene expression during postnatal development coincides with the morphological appearance of the sebaceous tissues in which the gene is expressed. The function of CYP2B12 has remained obscure, not only because of its cell type specificity but also because no substrate for CYP2B12 was identified. Preputial gland microsomes showed no enzymatic activity with substrates metabolized by other CYP2B enzymes (4Friedberg T. Grassow M.A. Bartlomowicz-Oesch B. Siegert P. Arand M. Adesnik M. Oesch F. Biochem. J. 1992; 287: 775-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), providing no clues as to the physiological functions of CYP2B12. In situhybridization studies led us to identify sebocytes as the source of CYP2B12 in skin, providing new insight on potential substrates and endogenous functions. A role in some aspect of cutaneous lipid metabolism seemed plausible because an important function of differentiated keratinocytes in the epidermis and sebaceous glands is the biosynthesis of specialized lipids (13Nicolaides N. Science. 1974; 186: 19-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). Cutaneous lipids are essential to prevent excessive transepithelial water loss and are important for thermoregulation in response to stress (13Nicolaides N. Science. 1974; 186: 19-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar, 18Wheatley V.R. Physiol. Pathophysiol. Skin. 1986; 9: 2705-2721Google Scholar, 19Chen W. Kelly M.A. Opitz-Araya X. Thomas R.E. Low M.J. Cone R.D. Cell. 1997; 91: 789-798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). The successful expression of CYP2B12 in E. coli allowed the identification of the first known substrate for this enzyme. Recombinant CYP2B12 catalyzes NADPH-dependent epoxidation of arachidonic acid, an important precursor of many lipid mediators (14Capdevila J.H. Zeldin D. Karara A. Falck J.R. Adv. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 14: 317-339Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Other CYP2B arachidonic acid epoxygenases are known: rabbit lung CYP2B4 (20Zeldin D.C. Plitman J.D. Kobayashi J. Miller R.F. Snapper J.R. Falck J.R. Szarek J.L. Philpot R.M. Capdevila J.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 2150-2160Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), a putative CYP2B4 orthologue in guinea pig lung (21Knickle L.C. Bend J.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 1273-1280PubMed Google Scholar), and rat liver CYP2B1 and CYP2B2 (22Capdevila J.H. Karara A. Waxman D.J. Martin M.V. Falck J.R. Guengerich F.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10865-10871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Unlike CYP2B12, these CYP2B epoxygenases are expressed in multiple tissues, and their activities are less regioselective. CYP2B12 produces a single major EET regioisomer, mainly 11,12-EET, from arachidonic acid. This degree of regioselectivity during arachidonic acid epoxidation is quite unusual (23Capdevila J.H. Zeldin D. Makita K. Karara A. Falck J.R. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Cytochrome P450: Structure, Mechanism and Biochemistry. Plenum Press, New York1995: 443-471Crossref Google Scholar) (Table III). An exception is rabbit lung CYP2B4, which generates 5,6-EET as the predominant EET (20Zeldin D.C. Plitman J.D. Kobayashi J. Miller R.F. Snapper J.R. Falck J.R. Szarek J.L. Philpot R.M. Capdevila J.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 2150-2160Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Another distinction is that CYP2B12 catalyzes only epoxidation of arachidonic acid, whereas CYP2B4 (20Zeldin D.C. Plitman J.D. Kobayashi J. Miller R.F. Snapper J.R. Falck J.R. Szarek J.L. Philpot R.M. Capdevila J.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 2150-2160Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), CYP2E1 (24Laethem R.M. Balazy M. Falck J.R. Laethem C.L. Koop D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12912-12918Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), CYP2J3 (16Wu S. Chen W. Murphy E. Gabel S. Tomer K.B. Foley J. Steenbergen C. Falck J.R. Moomaw C.R. Zeldin D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12551-12559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar), and CYP2J4 (17Zhang Q.-Y. Ding X. Kaminsky L.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 340: 270-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), for example, generate ω/ω-1 alcohols or other eicosanoids as major products. Importantly, lauric acid is not a CYP2B12 substrate. The catalysis of eicosanoid oxidation by CYP2B12 suggests that this enzyme may participate in signal transduction mechanisms in keratinocytes. Although CYP2B12 exhibits a relatively high level of constitutive expression, EET generation may be regulated by cellular phospholipases and arachidonic acid release (14Capdevila J.H. Zeldin D. Karara A. Falck J.R. Adv. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 14: 317-339Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 23Capdevila J.H. Zeldin D. Makita K. Karara A. Falck J.R. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Cytochrome P450: Structure, Mechanism and Biochemistry. Plenum Press, New York1995: 443-471Crossref Google Scholar). Another source of EETs might include EETs esterified into cellular glycerophospholipids (25Zhu Y. Schieber E.B. McGiff J.C. Balazy M. Hypertension. 1995; 25: 854-859Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Karara A. Dishman E. Falck J.R. Capdevila J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7561-7569Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although in vivo functions for endogenous EETs produced by CYP2B12 remain to be proven, clues may be obtained from studies of other arachidonic acid epoxygenases. The biological activities of EETs or their hydration products, dihydroxyeicosatrienoic acids, involve changes in membrane permeability to Ca2+, Na+, K+, and H+, as well as stimulation of peptide hormone secretion and vasomodulation (14Capdevila J.H. Zeldin D. Karara A. Falck J.R. Adv. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 14: 317-339Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 23Capdevila J.H. Zeldin D. Makita K. Karara A. Falck J.R. Ortiz de Montellano P.R.

In epidermal keratinocyte cultures, increases in extracellular Ca2+ concentrations lead to increases in intracellular Ca2+ concentration and result in keratinocyte differentiation (28Yuspa S.H. Kilkenny A.E. Steinert P.M. Roop D.R. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 1207-1217Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar, 29Hennings H. Kruszewski F.H. Yuspa S.H. Tucker R.W. Carcinogenesis. 1989; 10: 777-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The correlation also exists in mouse epidermis in situ. The greatest concentrations of inter- and intracellular Ca2+ localize cytochemically to the upper epidermal cell layer (30Menon G.K. Grayson S. Elias P.M. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1985; 84: 508-512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar), the stratum granulosum, which contains the most terminally differentiated, nucleated keratinocytes. By analogy, sebocytes are the most terminally differentiated keratinocytes in sebaceous glands. We hypothesize that the CYP2B12-dependent production of 11,12-EET may be involved in establishing the differentiated phenotype or maintaining a differentiated function of keratinocytes in sebaceous tissues. We thank Drs. Yasuna Kobayashi and James Halpert for assistance in expression and purification of CYP2B12 and Dr. Jorge Capdevila for assistance in arachidonic acid metabolism studies and critical interpretation of the data. Support and technical assistance from the Skin Diseases Research Center at Vanderbilt are greatly appreciated, especially the contributions of Drs. Lillian Nanney and Lloyd E. King, Jr., in data interpretation and consultations in cutaneous biology."

It donates four mannosyl residues in the N-linked oligosaccharide precursor and all three mannosyl residues in the core of the glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor. In yeasts it also donates one mannose to the O-linked oligosaccharide. The yeastDPM1 gene encodes a Dol-P-Man synthase that is a transmembrane protein expressed in the endoplasmic reticulum. We cloned human and mouse homologues of DPM1, termedhDPM1 and mDPM1, respectively, both of which encode proteins of 260 amino acids, having 30% amino acid identity with yeast Dpm1 protein but lacking a hydrophobic transmembrane domain, which exists in the yeast synthase. Human and mouse DPM1cDNA restored Dol-P-Man synthesis in mouse Thy-1-deficient mutant class E cells. Mouse class E mutant cells had an inactivating mutation in the mDPM1 gene, indicating that mDPM1 is the gene for class E mutant. In contrast, hDPM1 and mDPM1 cDNA did not complement another Dol-P-Man synthesis mutant, hamster Lec15 cells, whereas yeast DPM1restored both mutants.

The enzyme is expressed in the endoplasmic reticulum. The Saccharomyces cerevisiae dpm1 mutant is defective in synthesis of Dol-P-Man. Its gene, DPM1, has been cloned (6Orlean P. Albright C.

Dpm1p expressed in CHO cells showed reticular immunofluorescence staining, suggesting expression in the endoplasmic reticulum (8Beck P.J. Orlean P. Albright C. Robbins P.W. Gething M.J. Sambrook J.F.

Cell. 1978; 14: 21-32Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) do not synthesize Dol-P-Man (10Chapman A. Fujimoto K. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 4441-4446Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and consequently do not synthesize the GPI core, resulting in the defective surface expression of GPI-anchored proteins, such as Thy-1 (11Sugiyama E. DeGasperi R. Urakaze M. Chang H.M. Thomas L.J. Hyman R. Warren C.D. Yeh E.T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12119-12122Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The Lec15 mutant of CHO cells is also defective in Dol-P-Man synthesis (12Stoll J. Robbins A.R. Krag S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 2296-2300Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Because they lack Dol-P-Man, the donor of the last four mannosyl residues in the N-linked oligosaccharide precursor, neither Lec15 nor class E cells assemble a mature oligosaccharyl precursor but rather, accumulate an intermediate bearing five mannosyl residues (10Chapman A.

Since this intermediate transfers incomplete oligosaccharides to proteins and are modified to complex type oligosaccharides without trimming of mannosyl residues by swainsonine-sensitive α-mannosidase II, these mutants are not sensitive to swainsonine treatment (8Beck P.J.

A human genomic library (Stratagene) was screened with an hDPM1 cDNA probe (1-kilobase pairXhoI-NotI fragment). The ribonuclease protection assay was done with a HybSpeed RPA kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) and total RNA of HeLa cells. We identified a number of ESTs ofmDPM1 in a data base of EST (National Center of Biotechnology Information) and synthesized polymerase chain reaction primers from those sequences. Using cDNA prepared from RNA of wild-type BW5147 and its class E mutant cells as templates, we amplified mDPM1 cDNA in two overlapping fragments and cloned and sequenced them. The primers used were 5′-GTCCATGGCTTCCACGGGGGCGAG and 5′-TGGTGGGAGAGGTCAGCATCCA to amplify the region spanning nucleotides 1–371, and 5′-GCAGAGATCTATGGGCCCGACAG and 5′-TGAACACGGGAAGCATAAGTGAATCA to amplify the region spanning nucleotides 235–815. An expression plasmid for hDPM1 tagged with glutathioneS-transferase (GST-hDPM1) was prepared as described previously (16Watanabe R. Kinoshita T. Masaki R. Yamamoto A. Takeda J. Inoue N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26868-26875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Flag-tagged microsomal aldehyde dehydrogenase (16Watanabe R. Kinoshita T. Masaki R. Yamamoto A. Takeda J. Inoue N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26868-26875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) was used as a control membrane-bound protein. Wild-type CHO and Lec15 cells expressing GST-hDPM1, free GST, and Flag-aldehyde dehydrogenase were hypotonically lysed and separated into soluble (cytoplasm) and insoluble (membranes) fractions by centrifugation at 100,000 ×g for 1 h. These fractions were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis/Western blotting against goat anti-GST (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) visualized by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-goat IgG antibody (Organon Teknika) plus chemiluminescence reactions (Renaissance, DuPont). The same samples were also Western blotted against anti-Flag antibody M2 (Kodak) (16Watanabe R. Kinoshita T. Masaki R. Yamamoto A. Takeda J. Inoue N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26868-26875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). A search of the TIGR EST data base for a homologue of a nucleotide sequence of yeast DPM1 identified a cluster of ESTs. This cluster contained a contiguous sequence of 451 nucleotides (Fig. 1, nucleotides 5–455) that has 41% identity to the corresponding sequence of yeast DPM1. We amplified both the 5′ and 3′ ends of this cDNA sequence by RACE methods from a cDNA library derived from human placenta and ligated and cloned them in a mammalian expression vector, then transfected the vector into mouse class E mutant cells. The cloned cDNA, 1043 base pairs (Fig. 1, nucleotides 5–1047), partially restored the surface expression of Thy-1 (data not shown), indicating that Dol-P-Man synthesis was partially restored leading to a synthesis of the GPI anchor and the surface expression of GPI-anchored proteins. Since there was no methionine codon near the 5′ end and a reading frame was open to the 5′ end, we tried to amplify the 5′ end by RACE methods again, but only three more nucleotides (Fig. 1, nucleotides 2–4) were obtained. It is possible that some structural constraint hampered reverse-transcription of the 5′ end. To obtain the 5′ end of the coding region, we isolated a genomic clone of human homologue of DPM1. We identified four exons in the genomic clone of 17 kilobase pairs by comparing its sequence with the cDNA sequence. The exon sequences were exactly the same as the corresponding cDNA sequences, indicating that this clone represented the human gene homologous to DPM1. The four exon boundaries corresponded to cDNA nucleotide numbers 161, 261, and 295 (nucleotide number 1 at A of the initiation codon ATG; see Fig. 1). The genomic clone contained an exon that included a methionine codon at two residues amino-terminal to the end of the partial cDNA (Fig. 1). This methionine codon was within a Kozak consensus sequence (21Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8125-8148Crossref PubMed Scopus (4148) Google Scholar). We prepared an expression construct including these two residues (spanning nucleotides −54 to 1047) and transfected it into a class E mutant. The surface expression of Thy-1 was completely restored (Fig. 2), indicating that we cloned the full-length coding region. Based on this functional activity, we termed the cloned gene hDPM1. Since the reading frame was still open to the 5′ end, we analyzed a start site of transcription with the ribonuclease protection assay using RNA of HeLa cells. Only one protected fragment of thehDPM1 RNA probe was seen and from its size the start site of transcription was determined to be at around nucleotide −10 (data not shown). This is consistent with the idea that the methionine codon at position 1–3 is the initiation codon. Human DPM1 encodes a protein of 260 amino acids. Fig. 3 compares amino acid sequences of yeast Dpm1p (267 amino acids) and hDPM1 protein. The amino acid identity between homologous regions is about 30%. There are two significant differences. Human DPM1 has 22 extra residues at the amino terminus. This sequence is hydrophilic. Human DPM1 is shorter than Dpm1p at the carboxyl terminus by 29 residues. The hydropathy profile of hDPM1 protein (not shown) indicated that it lacks a transmembrane domain and an amino-terminal hydrophobic signal sequence. So, hDPM1 has characteristics of a cytoplasmic protein or a peripheral membrane protein. In contrast, yeast Dpm1p has a carboxyl-terminal hydrophobic segment that may be a transmembrane domain. Human DPM1 had a sequence RKIIS (Fig. 3, amino acids 161–165) that is similar to a consensus phosphorylation site sequence for cAMP-dependent protein kinase found in Dpm1p (RRVIS corresponding to amino acids 137–141) (6Orlean P. Albright C. Robbins P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17499-17507Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Restoration of Dol-P-Man synthase activity in class E mutants was tested after stable transfection of an expression construct of hDPM1(Fig. 4). Class E cells had almost no activity.hDPM1 and yeast DPM1 restored Dol-P-Man synthase in class E cells to levels about 3 times and 2.5 times as high as the wild-type level, respectively. To confirm that restoration of Dol-P-Man synthase activity in class E cells by hDPM1 led to restoration of synthesis of GPI anchor precursors, we labeled the class E cells and hDPM1 and DPM1 transfectants with [3H]mannose, and analyzed mannolipids. As shown in Fig. 5, the synthesis of Dol-P-Man and mannose-containing GPI anchor precursors was restored. These results indicate that hDPM1 restored the defective synthesis of Dol-P-Man in class E mutant cells. We next tested whether hDPM1 complements Lec15 mutant. It was reported previously that yeast DPM1 fully complemented defective Dol-P-Man synthesis of Lec15 (8Beck P.J. Orlean P. Albright C. Robbins P.W. Gething M.J. Sambrook J.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 4612-4622Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) as well as that of class E. On the other hand, there is a report that Lec15 and class E are different mutants (5Singh N. Tartakoff A.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 391-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). We confirmed the latter by a cell hybridization experiment; heterokaryons expressed Thy-1 on the cell surface 2 days after fusion, indicating complementation (data not shown). We stably transfected Lec15 mutant cells with hDPM1 and DPM1, and assessed restoration of Dol-P-Man synthase activity. Consistent with its leaky phenotype (17Camp L.A. Chauhan P. Farrar J.D. Lehrman M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6721-6728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the lysate of Lec 15 mutant cells synthesized about 20% as much Dol-P-Man as the lysate of wild-type CHO cells (Fig. 6). YeastDPM1 restored Dol-P-Man synthesis of Lec 15 mutant as reported (8Beck P.J. Orlean P. Albright C. Robbins P.W. Gething M.J. Sambrook J.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 4612-4622Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), whereas hDPM1 had no enhancement effect (Fig. 6). Transfection of the same expression vector of hDPM1cDNA into wild-type CHO cells doubled the Dol-P-Man synthase activity (data not shown), indicating that the expression vector was functional in CHO cells. To confirm the inability of hDPM1 to complement Lec15, we cultured wild-type CHO cells, Lec15, and Lec15 hDPM1 and DPM1 transfectants in swainsonine for 4 days, before staining them with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated phytohemagglutinin-E4 for complex oligosaccharides. The staining intensity of wild-type CHO decreased by 75% after incubation in swainsonine, whereas that of Lec15 did not change as expected (Fig. 7, panels A and B). In about a half of the DPM1-transfected Lec15 cells, the staining intensity was reduced by 80% after incubation in swainsonine, indicating complementation (panel C). On the other hand,hDPM1-transfected Lec15 cells maintained a mutant phenotype (panel D). A mDPM1 cDNA encoded a protein of 260 amino acids having 91% identity in amino acids with hDPM1 protein (Fig. 8 A). Nucleotide sequence analysis of products of reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction from class E cells demonstrated that all eight clones had a T to C substitution at nucleotide 365 that caused a change of serine 122 to phenylalanine. To test whether this missense mutation causes a loss of function, we transfected the mutant mDPM1 cDNA into class E mutant cells. The cDNA bearing the mutation did not restore the surface expression of Thy-1 while the wild-type cDNA restored it (Fig. 8 B), indicating that this base substitution is an inactivating mutation and that the class E cell is a mutant of themDPM1 gene. The above results indicate that synthesis of Dol-P-Man in mammalian cells is mediated by a mammalian homologue of Dpm1p and a product of the gene defective in Lec15 cells. hDPM1 protein may be either a cytoplasmic protein or a peripheral membrane protein as described above. If the former is true, the protein defective in Lec15 cells may be required for association of hDPM1 protein with the membrane. In this case, Dol-P-Man synthesis activity would be complemented if the cytoplasm of Lec15 cells that may contain a soluble DPM1 homologue is mixed with the membranes of class E cells that may contain the protein necessary for membrane association of DPM1 homologue. This mixture, however, was inactive (data not shown), indicating that the latter case may be true. To confirm this, we tested whether hDPM1 is membrane-bound even when expressed in Lec15 cells. As shown in Fig. 9, transfected GST-tagged hDPM1 was expressed in the membrane of Lec15 cells (lane 4) but not in the cytoplasm (lane 3), similarly to transfection into wild-type CHO cells (lanes 1 and 2). Therefore, it appeared that the protein defective in Lec15 cells is not required for membrane association of mammalian DPM1. We have cloned a human homologue of the yeast Dol-P-Man synthase gene DPM1 and termed it hDPM1. AnhDPM1 cDNA complemented mouse Thy-1-negative class E mutant cells that are defective in Dol-P-Man synthesis, indicating that the hDPM1 gene product participates in Dol-P-Man synthesis (Figs. 2, 4, and 5). However, the hDPM1 cDNA did not complement another Dol-P-Man synthesis mutant, CHO Lec15 (Figs. 6 and7). To determine whether class E cells are defective in mouseDPM1 homologue, we cloned it, analyzed its sequence in class E cells, and found an inactivating mutation (Fig. 8). This indicates that the defective Dol-P-Man synthesis in class E cells is due to the mutation in mDPM1. Somatic cell hybridization demonstrated that class E and Lec15 cells are of different complementation groups (5Singh N. Tartakoff A.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 391-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). These results together indicate that two genes, a DPM1homologue and one defective in Lec15 cells, are necessary for synthesis of Dol-P-Man in mammalian cells. In contrast to hDPM1 cDNA, yeast DPM1 DNA complemented both class E and Lec15 mutants (8Beck P.J. Orlean P. Albright C. Robbins P.W. Gething M.J. Sambrook J.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 4612-4622Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 14DeGasperi R. Thomas L.J. Sugiyama E. Chang H.M. Beck P.J. Orlean P. Albright C. Waneck G. Sambrook J.F. Warren C.D. Yeh E.T.H. Science. 1990; 250: 988-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) (Figs. 2 and Figure 4, Figure 5, Figure 6, Figure 7). Since yeast Dpm1p has Dol-P-Man synthase activity by itself, it is not surprising that yeast DPM1 complements both mutants. A major structural difference between yeast and human Dpm1 proteins is that yeast Dpm1p has a hydrophobic carboxyl-terminal segment, whereas human DPM1 protein lacks it (Fig. 3). The hydrophobic segment in Dpm1p may serve as a transmembrane domain (6Orlean P. Albright C. Robbins P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17499-17507Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and in addition it may act as an acceptor site for Dol-P. hDPM1 protein does not have a hydrophobic segment for a typical transmembrane domain, nevertheless, it associated with the membrane even in Lec15 cells (Fig. 9), suggesting that hDPM1 may be a peripheral membrane protein. The protein defective in Lec15 cells, therefore, does not play a role in association of hDPM1 with the membrane. So, a possible role of that protein may be in a step of Dol-P-Man synthesis, such as binding of Dol-P. It is noticeable, however, that an expression level of GST-tagged hDPM1 protein in Lec15 mutant was much lower than that in wild-type CHO cells (Fig. 9). This suggests another possible role of the protein defective in Lec15 cells,i.e. it may be necessary for stable expression of hDPM1 in the endoplasmic reticulum. This has to be formally shown by a complementation experiment when the gene defective in Lec15 mutant is cloned because it is possible that some nonrelevant mechanism operating in this particular Lec15 cell line caused rapid degradation of GST-tagged hDPM1 and/or its mRNA. Recently, a hamster SL15 cDNA was cloned (22Ware F.E. Lehrman M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13935-13938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar).SL15 encodes a protein of 248 amino acids bearing at least two putative transmembrane domains and a double-lysine endoplasmic reticulum retention signal near the carboxyl terminus, suggesting that it is an endoplasmic reticulum transmembrane protein (22Ware F.E. Lehrman M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13935-13938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar).SL15 is a candidate that is necessary, together with mammalian DPM1, for Dol-P-Man synthesis, because it has been reported to suppress the Lec15 mutation. It is yet to be determined whether the Lec15 mutation is actually due to a defect in SL15 or some other protein. The synthesis of Dol-P-Man in yeast and mammalian cells, therefore, differs; Dpm1p alone is sufficient in S. cerevisiae, whereas at least two gene products are necessary in mammalian cells.DPM1 homologues were cloned from a protozoa,Trypanosoma brucei brucei and a fungus Ustilago maydis (23Mazhari-Tabrizi R. Eckert V. Blank M. Mueller R. Mumberg D. Funk M. Schwarz R.T. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 853-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 24Zimmerman J.W. Specht C.A. Cazares B.X. Robbins P.W. Yeast. 1996; 12: 765-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The overall structure of T. b. bruceiDPM1 protein is very similar to that of yeast Dpm1p, i.e.267 amino acids having a hydrophobic putative transmembrane domain near the carboxyl terminus. U. maydis DPM1 protein is of 294 amino acids. It also has a hydrophobic putative transmembrane domain near the carboxyl terminus. These two DPM1 proteins have Dol-P-Man synthase activity in vitro. So, only mammalian DPM1 protein requires an additional protein and lacks the carboxyl-terminal hydrophobic segment. Moreover, S. cerevisiae Dol-P-Man synthase is active in the presence of nonionic detergent (6Orlean P. Albright C. Robbins P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17499-17507Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Schutzbach J.S. Zimmerman J.W. Forsee W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24190-24196Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas mammalian Dol-P-Man synthase is inactive (25Jensen J.W. Schutzbach J.S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 153: 41-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Furthermore, amino acid identities among three microbial Dpm1 proteins are 49–60%, whereas those between mammalian DPM1 and three microbial ones are only about 30%. Therefore, mammalian DPM1 diverged from three microbial DPM1s. A consensus sequence for cAMP-dependent protein kinase-mediated phosphorylation is conserved in yeast,Ustilago and Trypanosoma DPM1 proteins,i.e. RRVIS (6Orlean P. Albright C. Robbins P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17499-17507Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), RRIIS (24Zimmerman J.W. Specht C.A. Cazares B.X. Robbins P.W. Yeast. 1996; 12: 765-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), and RRFIS (23Mazhari-Tabrizi R. Eckert V. Blank M. Mueller R. Mumberg D. Funk M. Schwarz R.T. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 853-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), respectively. The corresponding sequence in hDPM1 was RKIIS (amino acids 161–165). Although the double arginine sequence conserved in three other DPM1 proteins is changed to arginine-lysine in hDPM1, it would still be consistent with a phosphorylation site (26Kemp B.E. Graves D.J. Benjamini E. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 4888-4894Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Kennelly P.J. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15555-15558Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It was reported that Dol-P-Man synthase activities of microsomes prepared from rat, bovine, and hen cells were enhanced by 30–80% upon phosphorylation with cAMP-dependent kinase (28Banerjee D.K. Kousvelari E.E. Baum B.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 6389-6393Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Whether this regulation of Dol-P-Man synthesis is mediated through phosphorylation of DPM1 is yet to be determined.

https://openalex.org/W1968567905,"The major microtubule-associated protein in echinoderms is a 77-kDa, WD repeat protein, called EMAP. EMAP-related proteins have been identified in sea urchins, starfish, sanddollars, and humans. We describe the purification of sea urchin EMAP and demonstrate that EMAP binding to microtubules is saturable at a molar ratio of 1 mol of EMAP to 3 mol of tubulin dimer. Unlike MAP-2, MAP-4, or tau proteins, EMAP binding to microtubules is not lost by cleavage of tubulin with subtilisin. In addition to binding to the microtubule polymer, EMAP binds to tubulin dimers in a 1:1 molar ratio. The abundance of EMAP in the egg suggests that it could function to regulate microtubule assembly. To test this hypothesis, we examined the effects of EMAP on the dynamic instability of microtubules nucleated from axoneme fragments as monitored by video-enhanced differential interference contrast microscopy. Addition of 2.2 μm EMAP to 21 μm tubulin results in a slight increase in the elongation and shortening velocities at the microtubule plus ends but not at the minus ends. Significantly, EMAP inhibits the frequency of rescue 8-fold without producing a change in the frequency of catastrophe. These results indicate that EMAP, unlike brain microtubule-associated proteins, promotes microtubule dynamics.

These results indicate that EMAP, unlike brain microtubule-associated proteins, promotes microtubule dynamics. Microtubules are essential structural and functional components of the mitotic apparatus, the machinery responsible for chromosome movements to the daughter cells in all eukaryotic cells. The transition from interphase to mitosis (G2/M) requires a rapid reorganization of the microtubule array and imposes compulsory changes in microtubule dynamics. Longer interphase microtubules are replaced by shorter, less stable, mitotic microtubules (1Gelfand V.I. Bershadsky A.D. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1991; 7: 93-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 2Inouè S. Salmon E.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1619-1640Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). This microtubule behavior is best described by dynamic instability, a phenomenon where microtubules in a population exist in both growing and shortening phases (3Mitchison T. Kirschner M. Nature. 1984; 312: 237-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (2270) Google Scholar). Dynamic instability is driven by GTP hydrolysis and exchange, such that microtubules with ends composed of GTP-bound tubulin preferentially elongate whereas microtubules with GDP-tubulin rapidly shorten (3Mitchison T. Kirschner M. Nature. 1984; 312: 237-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (2270) Google Scholar, 4Carlier M. Pantaloni D. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 1918-1920Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 5Hill T. Carler M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 7234-7238Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In addition to the kinetics of subunit addition, the morphology of the microtubule ends may contribute significantly to the dynamic properties of microtubules (6Hyman A.A. Karsenti E. Cell. 1996; 84: 401-410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Measurable parameters of dynamic instability include the number of nucleation sites, the growth and shortening rates, the frequency of transition from growing to shortening (catastrophe), and the frequency of transition from shortening to growing (rescue) (7Horio T. Hotani H. Nature. 1986; 321: 605-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar, 8Walker R.A. O'Brien E.T. Pryer N.K. Soboeiro M.F. Voter W.A. Erickson H.P. Salmon E.D. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 1437-1448Crossref PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar). It is likely that many factors interact to regulate microtubule dynamics (1Gelfand V.I. Bershadsky A.D. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1991; 7: 93-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 9Cassimeris L. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1993; 26: 275-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar,10McNally F.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 23-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Factors known to regulate microtubule dynamics include microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs). 1The abbreviations used are: MAP, microtubule-associated protein; Pipes, piperazine-N,N′-bis(2-ethanesulfonic acid); VE-DIC, video-enhanced differential interference contrast microscopy; Hu, human; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. 1The abbreviations used are: MAP, microtubule-associated protein; Pipes, piperazine-N,N′-bis(2-ethanesulfonic acid); VE-DIC, video-enhanced differential interference contrast microscopy; Hu, human; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Neuronal brain MAPs, the most abundant of which are MAP-2 and tau, stimulate microtubule assembly by promoting nucleation and, more specifically, by decreasing the rate of microtubule depolymerization (11Sloboda R.D. Dentler W.L. Rosenbaum J.L. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 4497-4505Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 12Murphy D.B. Johnson K.A. Borisy G.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 1178: 33-52Crossref Scopus (144) Google Scholar). When the assembly of individual microtubules is monitored in the presence of MAP-2 or tau, dynamic instability is suppressed through the reduction of catastrophes, the promotion of rescue events, and a reduction in the rate of microtubule shortening (13Dreschel D.N. Hyman A.A. Cobb M.H. Kirschner M.W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 1141-1154Crossref PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar, 14Pryer N.K. Walker R.A. Skeen V.P. Bourns B.D. Soboeiro M.F. Salmon E.D. J.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11117-11127Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Other neuronal MAPs, such as MAP1B and the 3-repeat, immature form of tau, do not suppress dynamic instability (18Trinczek B. Biernat J. Baumann K. Mandelkow E.M. Mandelkow E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1887-1902Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 19Vandecandelaere A. Pedrotti B. Utton M.A. Calvert R.A. Bayley P.M. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1996; 35: 134-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Therefore, the dynamic properties of neuronal microtubules may be controlled in part by their MAP composition. In actively dividing cells, much less information is available regarding the effects of specific MAPs on microtubule dynamics. Within the mitotic apparatus, the turnover rates of individual microtubules vary such that kinetochore microtubules have longer half-lives than non-kinetochore microtubules (20Saxton W.M. Stemple D.L. Leslie R.J. Salmon E.D. Zavortink M. McIntosh J.R. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 2175-2186Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar, 21Zhai Y. Kronebusch P.J. Simon P.M. Borisy G.G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 201-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). It is likely that the stability of individual microtubules in the mitotic apparatus is controlled by individual MAPs. MAP-4, from HeLa cells, appears to stabilize microtubules by enhancing rescue events at microtubule plus ends (22Ookata K. Hisanaga S. Bulinski J.C. Murofushi H. Aizawa H. Itoh T.J. Hotani H.

This 30-fold enhancement of the rescue frequency is abolished when MAP-4 is phosphorylated by the p34cdc2 kinase, demonstrating that MAP function can be regulated further by post-translational events (22Ookata K. Hisanaga S. Bulinski J.C. Murofushi H. Aizawa H. Itoh T.J. Hotani H. Okumura E. Tachibana K. Kishimoto T. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 849-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). In Xenopus, the thermostabile, MAP-4-like XMAP230 stabilizes microtubules by suppressing catastrophes and decreasing the rate of microtubule shortening (23Andersen S.S.L. Buendia B. Domı́nguez J.E. Sawyer A. Karsenti E. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1289-1299Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In contrast, the unrelated XMAP215 increases the rate of microtubule elongation and shortening and decreases the rescue frequency (24Vasquez R.J. Gard D.L. Cassimeris L. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 985-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). A third Xenopus MAP, XMAP310, decreases the rate of shortening and promotes rescue (25Andersen S.S.L. Karsenti E. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 975-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Thus, within the same cell type, there are MAPs with unique effects on microtubule dynamics. The major microtubule-associated protein in the sea urchin is a 75–80-kDa protein called EMAP, which was first identified by its ability to co-polymerize with tubulin isolated from the mitotic apparatus (26Keller III, T.C.S. Rebhun L.I. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 93: 788-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). EMAP is not restricted to the mitotic apparatus; immunolocalization studies also reveal EMAP along interphase microtubule arrays in adult coelomocytes (27Bloom G.S. Luca F.C. Collins C.A. Vallee R.B. Cell Motil. 1985; 5: 431-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 28Suprenant K.A. Dean K. McKee J. Hake S. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 104: 445-456Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is likely that EMAP function is regulated by phosphorylation, since EMAP is phosphorylated in vivo in a cell cycle-dependent manner (29Brisch E. Daggett M.A.F. Suprenant K.A. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 2885-2893PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to microtubules, EMAP may interact with components of the translational machinery, such as ribosomes, that are associated with sea urchin microtubules in vitro and in vivo (28Suprenant K.A. Dean K. McKee J. Hake S. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 104: 445-456Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Suprenant K.A. Tempero L.B. Hammer L.E. Cell Motil.

Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 973-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Translation of a cDNA sequence for EMAP reveals that EMAP does not share significant sequence homology with other MAPs (32Li Q. Suprenant K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31777-31784Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In particular, a microtubule-binding domain has not been identified, although the very basic (pI 10) amino terminus of the protein is a candidate domain. Recently, a human gene for an EMAP-related protein was identified by positional cloning (33Eudy J.D. Ma-Edmonds M. Yao S. Talmadge C.B. Kelley P.H. Weston M.D. Kimberling W.J. Sumegi J. Genomics. 1997; 43: 104-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Human EMAP (HuEMAP) is a 79-kDa protein that is very similar to EMAP, sharing both a very basic amino terminus and a large WD-40 repeat domain (32Li Q. Suprenant K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31777-31784Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Eudy J.D. Ma-Edmonds M. Yao S. Talmadge C.B. Kelley P.H. Weston M.D. Kimberling W.J. Sumegi J. Genomics. 1997; 43: 104-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Remarkably, the HuEMAPgene appears to be located at the Usher syndrome type 1a locus at position 14q32 (33Eudy J.D.

Usher syndrome is a recessive genetic disorder that is characterized primarily by deafness accompanied by retinitis pigmentosa. Another variant of Usher syndrome, type 1b, results from mutations in the myosin VIIa gene (35Weil D. Banchard S. Kaplan J. Guilford P. Givson F. Walsh J. Mburu P. Varela A. Levilliers J. Weston M. Kelly P.M. Kimberling W.J. Wagenaar M. Levi-Acobas F. Larget-Piet D. Munnich A. Steel K.P. Brown S.D.M. Petit C. Nature. 1995; 374: 60-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (859) Google Scholar). It is possible that HuEMAP may be involved in related cytoskeletal processes in sensory epithelial cells such as the cochlear hair cells and retinal rod photoreceptor cells. The chromosomal region, 14q32, has also been implicated as a tumor suppressor gene loci (36Bandera C.A. Takahashi H. Behbakht K. Liu P.C. LiVolsi V.A. Benjamin I. Morgan M.A. King S.A. Rubin S.C.

Oncogene. 1992; 7: 1059-1065PubMed Google Scholar), thus suggesting that HuEMAP may be an important component in the normal cell proliferation pathway. To understand how EMAP affects microtubule behavior in dividing cells, we have purified EMAP to homogeneity from unfertilized sea urchin eggs. For this study, we have used video-enhanced differential interference contrast microscopy (VE-DIC) to examine the effects of EMAP on microtubule dynamics. Our results indicate that EMAP promotes microtubule turnover by dramatically decreasing the frequency of rescue. These results suggest that EMAP may play an important role in regulating microtubule dynamics. The following reagents were purchased from Research Organics Inc. (Cleveland, OH): ultrapure acrylamide, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate, dithiothreitol, glycine, Pipes, and Tris. Paclitaxel was purchased from Molecular Probes Inc. (Eugene, OR). All other reagents were from the Sigma or Fisher unless otherwise specified in the text. Microtubule protein was purified from unfertilized sea urchin (Strongylocentrotus purpuratus) eggs as described previously (30Suprenant K.A. Tempero L.B. Hammer L.E. Cell Motil.

Porcine tubulin and sea urchin sperm flagellar axonemes were also purified as described previously (8Walker R.A. O'Brien E.T. Pryer N.K. Soboeiro M.F. Voter W.A. Erickson H.P. Salmon E.D. J.

SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) was performed on discontinuous gels (3% stacking and 8% separating) as described in Laemmli (43Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar). For immunoblotting, proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose using the procedure of Towbin et al. (44Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44644) Google Scholar), probed with anti-EMAP antiserum (A58), and developed with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibodies, as described previously (28Suprenant K.A.

Biochem. 1984; 136: 175-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (1622) Google Scholar). Thirty to 40 mg of purified sea urchin egg microtubule protein was thawed on ice. Microtubules were induced to assemble by incubation at 30 °C for 20 min, and the microtubules were pelleted (50,000 rpm, 10 min, 30 °C, TLA100.3 rotor). The pellet was resuspended in 2 ml of ice-cold column buffer (10 mm Pipes/K+, 1 mmMgCl2, 0.1 mm GTP, 0.2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 3 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin A), homogenized, incubated on ice for 20 min, then centrifuged (50,000 rpm, 10 min, 2 °C). The supernatant was applied to a DE52 cellulose (Whatman) column. A 1.5 × 6-cm DE52 cellulose column was equilibrated in ≥10 column volumes of degassed column buffer at 4 °C. After equilibration, 2 ml of 10–15 mg/ml cold depolymerized microtubule proteins (50,000 rpm supernatant) were loaded on the column. The column was washed with ∼80 ml of column buffer and run by gravity with ∼20 cm pressure. Proteins bound to the column were eluted with 160 ml of a 0 to 0.6 m KCl linear gradient in column buffer. Two-milliliter fractions were collected throughout the gradient and analyzed by gel electrophoresis. The EMAP containing fractions were pooled and dialyzed against several changes of ice-cold PME buffer, pH 6.9 (100 mmPipes/K+, 1 mm MgSO4, 1 mm EGTA), over a 12–15-h period. EMAP was concentrated either by dialysis against solid polyvinylpyrrolidone (Sigma) or by concentration in a Slide-a-Lyzer (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The concentration of EMAP was limited to approximately 0.4 mg/ml in PME buffer; above this concentration, EMAP precipitated out of solution. The concentrated proteins were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. The egg tubulin-containing fractions were concentrated by ammonium sulfate precipitation (50% saturation, 4 °C, 20 min) and centrifuged at 27,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. Tubulin precipitates were resuspended in 1–2 ml of PME buffer, pH 6.9, containing 0.1 mm GTP and were desalted on Sephadex G-25 spin columns. Tubulin in the flow-through fractions was drop frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. Sea urchin microtubule proteins were quantitated by the enhanced bicinchoninic assay (Pierce) with bovine serum albumin as the protein standard. Porcine tubulin concentration was determined as described by Hyman and Karsenti (6Hyman A.A. Karsenti E. Cell. 1996; 84: 401-410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). A 300 × 7.8-mm gel filtration high pressure liquid chromatography column (BioSep-SEC-S2000; Phenomenex, Torrence, CA) was used to determine the native molecular mass of EMAP. The column was equilibrated and run in 100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7, with a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Gel filtration standards for size exclusion chromatography were thyroglobulin (670,000), bovine gamma globulin (158,000), chicken albumin (44,000), equine myoglobin (17,000), and vitamin B-12 (1,350) from Bio-Rad. Protein elution profiles were monitored by the absorbance spectra at 280 nm. A linear relationship was obtained from a plot of the logarithms of the molecular mass standards versus their elution time. The relative elution time for EMAP was used to determine the Mr for EMAP. Purified sea urchin egg tubulin was assembled into microtubules (24 °C, 20 min) in the presence of increasing amounts of purified EMAP in a microtubule assembly buffer (100 mm Pipes, pH 6.9, 1 mm MgSO4, 1 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm GTP, 20 μmtaxol). The microtubules were pelleted (100,000 × g, 24 °C, 10 min), and the supernatants and resuspended pellets were analyzed on Coomassie Blue-stained SDS gels. Densitometric analysis of the gels were carried out with a Hewlett-Packard Scan Jet Iicx and quantitated using NIH Image software. The molar stoichiometry of EMAP bound to tubulin dimers in microtubules and the stoichiometry of EMAP:tubulin dimers:37-kDa polypeptide in DE52 cellulose column fractions were estimated from densitometric analysis of Coomassie Blue-stained gels. Areas under each protein peak were converted to total mass units and divided by the appropriate molecular mass of each polypeptide to determine the relative number of moles of each polypeptide. The relative molecular masses used in these calculations were 100,000 for the tubulin dimer (α and β subunit), 75,000 for the EMAP monomer, and 37,000 for the unknown polypeptide. Bovine brain tubulin (1.5 mg/ml) was polymerized in the presence of 20 μm paclitaxel, in the presence or absense of 1.5% (w/w) subtilisin (Boehringer Mannheim). After 25 min at 30 °C, the reaction was stopped by placing the sample on ice and adding 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (46Serrano L. de la Torre J. Maccioni R.B. Avila J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 5989-5993Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Purified EMAP (5 μg) was added to both tubulin samples, along with an additional 1 mm GTP. The proteins were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min and then the microtubules were pelleted (100,000 × g, 30 °C, 10 min). The supernatants and resuspended pellets were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Microtubule assembly assays were performed as described in Walker et al. (8Walker R.A. O'Brien E.T. Pryer N.K. Soboeiro M.F. Voter W.A. Erickson H.P. Salmon E.D. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 1437-1448Crossref PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar) and Vasquezet al. (24Vasquez R.J. Gard D.L. Cassimeris L. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 985-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) using pig brain tubulin and sea urchin flagellar axonemes. Briefly, individual microtubules assembled from axoneme fragments were observed using video-enhanced differential interference contrast light microscopy (VE-DIC). Porcine brain tubulin (21 μm) was incubated in the presence or absence of purified EMAP (2.2 μm). The slides were maintained at 23 °C and examined for 30–60 min. The concentration of tubulin used was low enough to prevent spontaneous microtubule assembly under these conditions, and therefore, all assembly was off the axoneme fragments. For all samples, the plus and minus ends were distinguished by the faster rate of elongation on the plus ends. Individual microtubules were visualized using VE-DIC microscopy as described previously (24Vasquez R.J. Gard D.L. Cassimeris L. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 985-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 47Schnapp B.J. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 134: 561-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 48Salmon T. Walker R.A. Pryer N.K. BioTechniques. 1989; 7: 624-633Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Microtubule assembly and shortening rates were determined from video tapes using PC-based analysis software (49Gliksman N.R. Parsons S.F. Salmon E.D. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1271-1276Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 50Simon J.R. Parsons S.F. Salmon E.D. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1992; 21: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). For each microtubule tracked, the change in microtubule length was plotted versus time. The average rate of microtubule growth or shortening was determined using least squares regression analysis. The frequencies of catastrophe and rescue were determined as decribed in Walker et al. (8Walker R.A. O'Brien E.T. Pryer N.K. Soboeiro M.F. Voter W.A. Erickson H.P. Salmon E.D. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 1437-1448Crossref PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar). Standard deviations for transition frequencies were determined from the catastrophe or rescue frequency divided by the square root of the number of transitions observed (8Walker R.A. O'Brien E.T. Pryer N.K. Soboeiro M.F. Voter W.A. Erickson H.P. Salmon E.D. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 1437-1448Crossref PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar). This calculation assumes a Poisson distribution of growth or shortening times (8Walker R.A. O'Brien E.T. Pryer N.K. Soboeiro M.F. Voter W.A. Erickson H.P. Salmon E.D. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 1437-1448Crossref PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar). Dynamicity, as a measure of tubulin subunit addition or loss per unit time, was calculated as described previously (24Vasquez R.J. Gard D.L. Cassimeris L. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 985-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 51Toso R.J. Jordan M.A. Farrell K.W. Matsumoto B. Wilson L. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1285-1293Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). The most abundant microtubule-associated protein in sea urchins is a 77-kDa polypeptide called EMAP that copurifies stoichiometrically with microtubules assembled from sea urchin eggs. To examine the effect of EMAP on microtubule dynamics, EMAP was purified from third cycle egg microtubule protein. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis demonstrated that the pI of EMAP in microtubule protein was 6.9; therefore, EMAP was purified from the more acidic tubulin subunits on a DE52 cellulose, anion exchange column (Fig. 1). EMAP eluted from the column in two distinct peaks. The first EMAP fraction was greater than 98% pure and eluted from the column at approximately 0.17 m KCl (fractions 22–27). In this manner, over 400 μg of purified EMAP was obtained from a typical microtubule preparation starting with 100 ml of unfertilized sea urchin eggs (Figs. 1 and 2). The second EMAP fraction came off the column at approximately 0.25 m KCl (fractions 31–38) in a peak that contained tubulin dimers and a prominent 37-kDa polypeptide (Figs. 1 and 2). The molar ratio of the 37-kDa polypeptide to EMAP to tubulin dimers in this complex was estimated from the apparent mass ratios in the stained gels. A comparison of five separate experiments indicates that the molar ratio of EMAP:tubulin dimers appears to be constant at 1:1 in these complexes. In contrast, the ratio of the 37-kDa polypeptide to EMAP or tubulin appears to vary from 1:1, 1:2, and 1:3. On average, the molar ratio of the 37-kDa polypeptide:tubulin dimer:EMAP is 1:1.9:2.0 (n = 5). Finally, the last proteins to elute off the column, at approximately 0.35 to 0.5 m KCl, are tubulin dimers (fractions 43–48).Figure 2Microtubule proteins purified by anion exchange chromatography.

This is in close agreement with its molecular mass, 75,488 daltons, calculated from a translated cDNA sequence (32Li Q. Suprenant K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31777-31784Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and with the protein's estimated mass of 77 kDa on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. These results indicate that EMAP is probably a globular protein and is a monomer in its purified form. The acidic COOH terminus of tubulin has been postulated to be important for MAP binding to microtubules (46Serrano L. de la Torre J. Maccioni R.B. Avila J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 5989-5993Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 52Serrano L. Jesus A. Maccioni R.B. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 4675-4681Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 53Maccioni R.B.

Nature. 1989; 342: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). To determine if this region of tubulin was necessary for purified EMAP to bind to tubulin, we cleaved the COOH terminus of β-tubulin with subtilisin and assayed for EMAP binding (Fig. 3). The shift in the mobility of β-tubulin on the gel is consistent with subtilisin digestion. That all the EMAP pellets with subtilisin-digested microtubules indicates that EMAP does not bind to the COOH terminus of β-tubulin. EMAP alone does not pellet under these conditions. To assay the stoichiometry of EMAP binding to microtubules, increasing amounts of purified EMAP were added to a constant amount of purified sea urchin egg tubulin in the presence of GTP and the microtubule stabilizing agent, paclitaxel. After polymerization of the microtubules and centrifugation, the supernatants and pellets were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and scanning densitometry (Fig. 4). EMAP binding to microtubules was examined over an EMAP concentration range of 0 to 250 μg/ml. Quantitation of the microtubule-bound EMAP in the pellet and unbound EMAP in supernatant fractions reveals that binding of EMAP to microtubules is saturable at a mass ratio of approximately 1:4 (1 mol of EMAP monomer to 3 mol of tubulin dimer). The growth and shortening of individual microtubules in a nucleated assembly assay was followed using video-enhanced differential interference contrast (VE-DIC) microscopy.

To investigate this process, we modified histone H3 at the H3-H3 interface, within the histone (H2A-H2B-H3-H4)2octamer or the histone (H3-H4)2 tetramer, by forming adducts on the single cysteine of duck histone H3. We used three sulfhydryl reagents, iodoacetamide, N-ethylmaleimide, and 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid). Torsionally constrained DNA was assembled on the modified histones. The H3 adducts, which have no effect on the structure of the nucleosome, dramatically affected the structural transitions that the (H3-H4)2 tetrameric nucleoprotein particle can undergo. Iodoacetamide and N-ethylmaleimide treatment prevented the assembly of positively constrained DNA on the tetrameric particle, whereas 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) treatment strongly favored it. Determination of DNA topoisomer equilibrium after relaxation of the tetrameric nucleoprotein particles with topoisomerase I demonstrated that the structural transition occurs without histone dissociation. Incorporation of H2A-H2B dimers into the tetrameric particle containing modified or unmodified cysteines allowed nucleosomes to reform and blocked the structural transition of the particle.

The interaction of the histone H2A-H2B dimer with the histone (H3-H4)2 tetramer involves mostly hydrogen bonds and is significantly weaker than the interaction between H3 and H4 within the tetramer. This supports the model of a tripartite organization of the core histone octamer, the assembly of which is governed by positive cooperativity and reversibility (7Arents G. Burlingame R.W. Wang B.C.

Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 4955-4964Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). In addition, histone H2A-H2B dimers are more easily released and interchanged from chromatin than (H3-H4)2 tetramers (9Jackson S. Brooks W. Jackson V. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5392-5403Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar); the lability of the H2A-H2B dimer interaction within the nucleosome appears to additionally depend on RNA polymerase activity (10Baer B.W. Rhodes D. Nature. 1983; 301: 482-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 11Jackson V. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 719-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 12Louters L. Chalkley R. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 3080-3085Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Posttranslational modifications of the core histones, such as ubiquitination, methylation, phosphorylation, ADP-ribosylation, and acetylation, probably result in subtle changes in nucleosome structure. Among these modifications, the reversible acetylation of ε-amino groups of lysine residues present in the amino-terminal domains, or “tails,” of the core histones, is the most strongly linked with transcriptional activity. Certain transcriptional coactivators have acetyltransferase activity, and they can be targeted to specific promoters by transcription factors (13Bannister A.J. Kouzarides T. Nature. 1996; 384: 641-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (1518) Google Scholar, 14Mizzen C.A. Yang X.J. Kokubo T. Brownell J.E. Bannister A.J. Owen-Hughes T. Workman J. Wang L. Berger S.L. Kouzarides T.

More recently, it has been demonstrated that histone deacetylase can also be targeted by transcriptional repressors (reviewed in Ref. 16Wolffe A.P. Nature. 1997; 387: 16-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Targeted histone acetylation/deacetylation is likely to play a major role in inducing nucleosome structural changes, thus allowing transcription complex assembly/disassembly and/or RNA polymerase tracking. The structural complexity of the core histones makes the nucleosome a master molecule that governs biochemical processes implicating chromatin. Mechanisms that modify the conformation of chromatin in living cells are of considerable interest because they are likely to determine the efficiencies of transcription, replication, recombination, and DNA repair. Gene activation is accompanied by alterations in the conformation of chromatin, which for highly transcribed genes are revealed by an increased sensitivity to cleavage by nucleases. The nature of these alterations at the level of nucleosomal structure is not known, but it is clear that both histone-DNA interactions and histone content are modified. One possible way to spread alterations along a chromatin fiber is through the torsional stress generated by RNA polymerase during transcription (17Liu L.F. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 7024-7027Crossref PubMed Scopus (1475) Google Scholar,18Wu H.Y. Shyy S.H. Wang J.C. Liu L.F. Cell. 1988; 53: 433-440Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). Garrard and co-workers (19Lee M.S. Garrard W.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9675-9679Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 20Lee M.S. Garrard W.T. Embo. J. 1991; 10: 607-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) have proposed that transient positive supercoils downstream of a tracking RNA polymerase result in nucleosome splitting. A similar conclusion was reached from an investigation of the influence of positive stress on nucleosome assembly (9Jackson S. Brooks W. Jackson V. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5392-5403Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 21Jackson V. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5901-5912Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 22Jackson V. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10607-10619Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Recently, it was also shown that the histone (H3-H4)2 tetramer can associate with positively supercoiled DNA with a high affinity, probably as a result of a change in tetramer topology (23Hamiche A. Carot V. Alilat M. De Lucia F. O'Donohue M.F. Revet B. Prunell A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7588-7593Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Based on these observations, it has been proposed that a slight shift in the dimer-dimer interface may be all that is needed for the DNA to wrap the (H3-H4)2 tetramer in a right-handed helix (24Reeve J.N. Sandman K. Daniels C.J. Cell. 1997; 89: 999-1002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). To address the question of how the (H3-H4)2 tetramer can undergo a structural change allowing it to accommodate either negatively or positively supercoiled DNA, we modified the cysteine located at position 110 within the H3 molecule. X-ray crystallography studies have demonstrated that modifications of this cysteine do not change the histone structure (25Arents G. Moudrianakis E.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10489-10493Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 26Luger K. Mader A.W. Richmond R.K. Sargent D.F. Richmond T.J. Nature. 1997; 389: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (6725) Google Scholar). Because the two cysteines face each other at a distance of 6.2 Å, this should create steric hindrances at the H3-H3 interface within the (H3-H4)2tetramer. Adducts on the cysteine were formed by treating histone octamers and (H3-H4)2 tetramers with three different sulfhydryl reagents. We used these treated histones to reconstitute nucleoprotein particles on DNA mini-circles of negative and positive superhelicities. These experiments, together with an analysis of the topoisomerase I relaxation of the particles, demonstrate that the (H3-H4)2 tetramer can flip from the left-handed conformation it adopts within the nucleosome to a right-handed conformation. This flipping requires a reorientation of the H3-H3 interface, because adducts on cysteine 110 allow the freezing of the tetrameric particle in left- or right-handed conformations. The presence of histones H2A-H2B prevents this transition by blocking the tetramer in a left-handed structure. Such a conformational flexibility of the (H3-H4)2 tetramer could provide a fine-tuned mechanism for modulating the accessibility of DNA sequences within the nucleosome. The murine mammary tumor virus-long terminal repeat 359-bp fragment used to generate mini-circles spans the promoter from −280 to +72. It was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using the following primers, which contain an EcoRI site: primer 1, 5′-GCGAATTCTAGAACATTATTCTGCAAAAA-3′, and primer virus 2,5′-GCGAATTCAGGATCCGTGACGAGCGGAGA-3′. The resulting DNA fragment was digested with EcoRI and fractionated by electrophoresis on polyacrylamide gel. The 359-bp band was eluted from the gel. The DNA fragment was ligated to linearized dephosphorylated pUC18 under conditions whereby two tandemly repeated fragments were inserted into the vector (construct pUC359.2m). Negatively and positively supercoiled DNA topoisomers were prepared from the above fragment, after purification by gel electrophoresis and 32P end-labeling by circularization in the presence of ethidium bromide and netropsin, respectively. The different DNA topoisomers were separated by electrophoresis on acrylamide gels, the bands were excised, and the DNA was eluted (27Zivanovic Y. Goulet I. Prunell A. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 192: 645-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Duck erythrocyte nuclei were prepared according to the method described in Ref. 28Bates D.L. Butler P.J. Pearson E.C. Thomas J.O. Eur. J. Biochem. 1981; 119: 469-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, and histone octamers (1–2 mg/ml) were prepared as described previously (29Hamiche A. Schultz P. Ramakrishnan V. Oudet P. Prunell A. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 257: 30-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Long soluble chromatin obtained from micrococcal nuclease digestion of nuclei was adsorbed onto a hydroxyapatite column as described in Ref. 30Simon R.H. Felsenfeld G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1979; 6: 689-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar. Non-histone proteins histone H1 and histone H5, were eluted first, and the core histones were eluted second by sequential washes with 0.65 m and 2m NaCl (in 0.1 m potassium phosphate, pH 7, 0.25 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm2-β mercaptoethanol), respectively. To isolate H2A-H2B and H3-H4 histones separately, after the 0.65 m NaCl wash, a stepwise elution with 0.93 m NaCl allowed recovery of most of the H2A-H2B histone dimers without any contamination with (H3-H4)2 histone tetramers; 1.2 m NaCl eluted the remaining H2A-H2B histone dimers and also some of (H3-H4)2 histone tetramers; and 2 m NaCl elution allowed recovery of (H3-H4)2 histone tetramers, free from H2A-H2B histone dimers. Samples were dialyzed against 2m NaCl, 10 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.6), and 0.25 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Histone H2A-H2B dimers and histone (H3-H4)2 tetramers were concentrated by centrifugation in Centricon-10 and Centricon-30 microconcentrators (Amicon), respectively. Histone preparations were aliquoted and stored at −80 °C until use. DTNB was prepared as a 10 mm stock solution in 100 mm potassium phosphate (pH 8.0). Histone octamers and (H3-H4)2 tetramers in 10 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.6), 2 m NaCl (at a final thiol group concentration of 30 mm) were incubated with 0.25 mm DTNB under the conditions described under “Results.” The reaction was followed by recording absorbance at 412 nm. Product yield was calculated from its extinction coefficient, εM = 13.6 mm−1 (Ellman's reagent; Ref. 31Habeeb A.F.S.A. Methods Enzymol. 1972; 25: 457-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (864) Google Scholar). Treated histone octamers and tetramers were dialyzed to remove the excess of reagent and stored at −80 °C. NEM was prepared as a 1m stock solution in methanol. Histones were treated at room temperature with 1 mm NEM in 2 m NaCl and 10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.6. Histones were added directly to this solution in a 1-ml cuvette, and the reaction was followed by measuring the decrease of the absorbance at 305 nm (32Riordan J.F. Vallee B.L. Methods Enzymol. 1972; 25: 449-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The extinction coefficient value εM = 0.620 mm−1 was used for the calculations of reacted NEM. IA was prepared as a 1m stock solution in water. Histones were treated with 1 mm IA for 2–3 h at room temperature. To generate nucleoprotein particles, histone octamers or tetramers were assembled on topologically constrained DNA circles according to the “salt jump” method (33Stein A. J. Mol. Biol. 1979; 130: 103-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) as described in Ref. 29Hamiche A. Schultz P. Ramakrishnan V. Oudet P. Prunell A. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 257: 30-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar. The procedure involved the addition of 32P-labeled DNA topoisomer to the plasmid DNA (form I) from which the fragment originated (final DNA concentration, 200 mg/ml), followed by the suitable amount of histones (histone:DNA weight ratio =rw), in 2 m NaCl, 10 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. The mixture was first incubated for 10 min at 37 °C, diluted to 50 mg/ml DNA and 0.5m NaCl, incubated at the same temperature for 30 min, and finally dialyzed at 4 °C against 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA for at least 1.5 h. For the experiments involving measurement of the DNA topoisomer:histone ratio (two-dimensional gel electrophoresis), nonradioactive topoisomer was substituted to the carrier plasmid DNA. Assembly of histones H2A-H2B on tetrameric nucleoprotein particles was performed as follows: increasing amounts of purified H2A-H2B dimers were added to particle preparations; adjusted to 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.1 mm EDTA, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 100 mg/ml bovine serum albumin; and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. For relaxation studies, nucleoprotein particle preparations were adjusted to 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.1 mmEDTA, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 100 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and the DNA was relaxed by incubation with 800–1000 units of calf thymus topoisomerase I (Life Technologies, Inc.) per ml at 37 °C for 1 h (34Zivanovic Y. Duband-Goulet I. Schultz P. Stofer E. Oudet P. Prunell A. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 214: 479-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Octameric and tetrameric nucleoprotein particles were electrophoresed at room temperature in 4% polyacrylamide (acrylamide/bisacrylamide, 29:1, w/w) slab gels (0.15 × 17 × 18 cm) in TE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA). Gels were pre-electrophoresed for 1 h at 200–250 V and electrophoresed at the same voltage for 3–4 h with extensive buffer recirculation. Gels were dried and autoradiographed at −80 °C. For the two-dimensional gel analysis, after the first dimension run in TE buffer (see above), the bands were excised an loaded onto a second dimension 18% acrylamide denaturing gel (35Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar). DNA and histones were visualized by silver staining (36Wray W. Boulikas T. Wray U.P. Hanckock R. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 118: 197-203Crossref Scopus (2491) Google Scholar). In preparative relaxation experiments, “chromatin” gels were dried without heating to allow the reswelling of the excised gel slices and the elution of the DNAs. Unless otherwise stated, naked DNA was electrophoresed at room temperature in 4% polyacrylamide (acrylamide/bisacrylamide, 20:1, w/w) slab mini-gels (0.15 × 10 × 8 cm) for 2 h at 100 V in 20 mm sodium acetate, 2 mm EDTA, 40 mm Tris acetate (pH 7.8). When required for the separation of DNA topoisomers, chloroquine (125 μm) was included. The radioactivity in the bands was quantitated in the dried gels using a phosporimager (Fuji PC-Bas). Topoisomer linking difference relative to its most probable configuration is given by the equation, ΔLk=Lk−Lk0Equation 1 in which Lk and Lk0 are the linking numbers of the topoisomer and of its most probable configuration, respectively (37Wang J.C. Peck L.J. Becherer K. Cold Spring Harb. Symp. Quant. Biol. 1983; 47: 85-91Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). ΔLk is also known as the constraint (38Le Bret M. Biopolymers. 1980; 19: 619-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) or as the number of titratable superhelical turns (39Bauer W.R. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Bioeng. 1978; 7: 287-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Lk0 is the linking number at the center of the topoisomers equilibrium distribution, obtained upon DNA relaxation. It can be estimated, more conveniently, from the helical periodicity of the DNA, h0, through the equation, Lk0=N/h0Equation 2 in which N is the ring size (40Horowitz D.S. Wang J.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 173: 75-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). ΔLk was used to identify the topoisomers, using the valueh0 = 10.56 bp/turn (measured under the DNA gel electrophoresis conditions used here and for a migration at 25 °C (27Zivanovic Y. Goulet I. Prunell A. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 192: 645-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 41Goulet I. Zivanovic Y. Prunell A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 2803-2821Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar)). This h0 value and the ring sizeN = 359 bp were used to calculate Lk0 = 34.0 from equation (2Bina-Stein M. Simpson R.T. Cell. 1977; 11: 609-618Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) Topoisomers with Lk = 35, 34, 33, 32, and 31 have linking number differences ΔLk = +1, 0, −1, −2, and −3, respectively (see Eq. 1). The linking number increment associated with an octameric or tetrameric particle reconstitution is given by the following equation. ΔLkp=Lk0p−Lk0Equation 3 Lk0 was calculated from Eq. 2, usingh0 = 10.53 bp/turn as measured under relaxation conditions (42Zivanovic Y. Goulet I. Revet B. Le Bret M. Prunell A. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 200: 267-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Lk0 was Lk0 = 34.09 bp for the 359-bp mini-circle. Lkp0 is the linking number of the most probable configuration of the mini-circle partially wrapped around the histones. Lkp0 can be measured from the amounts of the different topoisomers in the equilibrium distribution obtained upon particle relaxation with topoisomerase I. If Lki and ri are the linking number and the amount of topoisomer i, respectively, then the following equation applies. Lk0p=Σ(Lki·ri)/ΣriEquation 4 The linking number difference or topological constraint of the loop, ΔLkl, is given by the equation, ΔLk=ΔLkp+ΔLklEquation 5 in which ΔLk and ΔLkp are given by Eqs. 1 and 3. This implies that the loop is an independent topological domain of constant size delimited by the clamping of DNA to the histones. We have used sulfhydryl reagents to investigate the structure and the dynamics of the nucleosome. Titration of the unique histone H3 cysteine by DTNB has been reported (43Feinstein D.L. Moudrianakis E.N. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 8409-8418Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The authors of that study concluded that cysteine accessibility is different in histone (H3-H4)2 tetramers (two cysteines, corresponding to the two H3 molecules, are titrated) than in histone (H2A-H2B-H3-H4)2 octamers (only one cysteine was titrated). To ensure that under our experimental conditions the two cysteines were reacted with DTNB in both histone tetramers and octamers, we treated them with DTNB at 25 °C for different periods of time in the presence of 2 m NaCl to preserve their oligomeric structure. Fig. 1 presents the result of such an experiment. The two histone H3 cysteines were rapidly titrated by DTNB within the histone tetramer. In contrast, within histone octamers, titration of one and two cysteines was achieved only after a treatment time of 25–30 min and 2–3 h, respectively. During that time, spontaneous hydrolysis of the DTNB was negligible. To confirm that the maximal absorbance reflected a complete reaction of the two cysteines with DTNB, we performed the following controls. After each reaction had reached its maximal value, an aliquot of the mixture was brought to a final concentration of 5 m urea to allow complete accessibility of the cysteines and incubated for 10 min at 37 °C with DTNB, and the absorbance was measured. There was no increase in the absorbance, compared with the samples untreated with urea. This allowed us to conclude that the two cysteines were titrated in both histone tetramers and octamers. In addition, samples containing untreated histone tetramers or octamers were brought to a final concentration of 5 m urea and then incubated for 15 min at 37 °C with DTNB, and the absorbance of the samples was measured. This absorbance was identical to that obtained in the previous experiment. Taken together, these results demonstrate that providing the reaction is left to proceed long enough, DTNB can react with the two histone H3 cysteines in both the histone tetramer and octamer. The same results were obtained for the titration of the cysteines withN-ethylmaleimide (not shown). We used torsionally constrained DNA mini-circles to reconstitute nucleoprotein particles on histone octamers or tetramers that were treated or not treated with sulfhydryl reagents. Fig. 2 presents the results of an experiment in which histone octamers were treated with either NEM, IA, or DTNB. The DNA topoisomers used to reconstitute a nucleosome had a linking number difference of ΔLk = −1 (Fig. 2, lanes 1–5) or +1 (lanes 6–10). Lanes 1 and 6 show the naked DNA. Lanes 2 and 3demonstrate the assembly of the untreated histone octamer particle on topoisomer −1, resulting mainly in the formation of mononucleosomes (OP) but also in the formation of some dinucleosomes ( Di). The amount of dinucleosomes assembled with the mini-circles increased with the increase of the histone:DNA ratio. The different dinucleosome bands correspond to different positions of the two nucleosomes on the DNA. Treatment of the histone octamers with the sulfhydryl reagents (Fig. 2, lanes 4–5) did not prevent the assembly of the nucleosome on DNA topoisomer −1. However, the formation of dinucleosomes was completely abolished, independent of the reagent used, even at the highest histone:DNA ratio. Lanes 7 and 8 show the assembly of the DNA topoisomer +1 on histone octamers. The migration of the DNA-protein complex was slower than that of the naked circle and corresponds to a histone tetrameric particle, illustrating the previously described release of H2A-H2B from histone octamers upon assembly on positively supercoiled DNA (23Hamiche A. Carot V. Alilat M. De Lucia F. O'Donohue M.F. Revet B. Prunell A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7588-7593Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). In contrast, histone octamers treated with the sulfhydryl reagents were unable to assemble with positively supercoiled mini-circles. Reaction of the cysteine with these reagents probably induces a conformational change of the histone (H3-H4)2 tetramer that does not allow it to accommodate positively supercoiled DNA. To test this hypothesis, negatively or positively supercoiled DNA mini-circles were assembled on (H3-H4)2 tetramers treated with these reagents. Fig. 3 shows the result of such an experiment. Lanes 2, 3, 7, and 8 demonstrate that untreated histone tetramers efficiently assemble on either negatively (lanes 2 and 3) or positively (lanes 7 and 8) constrained DNA, resulting in the formation of tetrameric nucleoprotein particles (TP). Histone tetramers treated with sulfhydryl reagents were able to associate on negatively constrained circles (lanes 4 and 5). However, these tetrameric particles migrated faster than the control particles, suggesting differences in conformation and/or composition. As observed for the histone octamer, positively supercoiled DNA was unable to assemble on histone tetramers treated with either NEM or IA (Fig. 3, NEM and IA, lanes 9 and 10). Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis allowed us to confirm that the band migrating at the same position as DNA topoisomer +1 did not contain nucleoprotein particles with an altered mobility (not shown). In contrast, treatment of the histone tetramer with DTNB allowed an efficient particle assembly with positively supercoiled DNA (Fig. 3, DTNB, lanes 9 and 10). It was intriguing that histone tetramers treated with NEM or IA associated exclusively with negatively constrained DNA, whereas histone tetramers treated with DTNB associated with both negatively and positively constrained DNA. In addition, as pointed out above, in the case of the negatively constrained circles, the tetrameric nucleoprotein particles migrated faster than the control ones, suggesting an altered conformation and/or histone composition. To investigate the possibility of a change in histone H3 structure induced by the formation of a DTNB adduct on cysteine 110, we compared the behavior of tetrameric nucleoprotein particles containing either one or two modified cysteines (Fig. 1). To obtain such tetramers containing a single modified cysteine, histone octamers were treated with DTNB, because cysteine titration within a histone octamer is much slower than in a tetramer, allowing us to stop the reaction after the titration of either one or two cysteins. Histone H2A-H2B were dissociated and histone tetramers purified. The resulting histone tetramers could be either mostly tetramers with one cysteine adduct or a mixture of tetramers containing zero, one, or two cysteine adducts. In the second hypothesis, after assembly of these treated histone tetramers with DNA topoisomer −1, the particle population containing two adducts per molecule should be visualized, after electrophoresis, by the presence of a fast migrating band. This band was not present (compare the positions of the tetrameric particles in Fig. 4), demonstrating the homogeneity of the tetrameric particles that contain one DTNB adduct. In contrast, the already described increased electrophoretic mobility of the particles containing two modified cysteines, assembled on negatively constrained mini-circles, was observed (Fig. 4, lane 3). The particles containing only one modified cysteine displayed a migration pattern indistinguishable from that of the control particles (Fig. 4, compare lanes 2 and 4).

Voltage-activated Ca2+ channels are expressed in a multitude of tissues and are involved in a variety of cell functions (1Catterall W.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 493-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (777) Google Scholar). The skeletal muscle l-type Ca2+ channel, also called dihydropyridine (DHP) 1The abbreviations used are: DHP, dihydropyridine; GFP, green fluorescent protein; βGFP, fusion protein of β1a and GFP; nt, nucleotide; ER, endoplasmic reticulum. receptor, is localized in the junctions between the transverse tubules and the sarcoplasmic reticulum (2Jorgensen A.O.

It consists of five subunits: the pore-forming α1S subunit, the α2δ subunit complex, a peripheral membrane protein, the β1asubunit, and the γ subunit, which is unique for this tissue (6Takahashi M.

Adams B.A. Niidome T. Numa S. Nature. 1990; 346: 567-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar) and the accessory channel subunits (12Pragnell M. De Waard M. Mori Y. Tanabe T. Snutch T.P. Campbell K.P. Nature. 1994; 368: 67-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). The molecular domain responsible for binding the β subunit is a conserved motif of nine amino acids in the cytoplasmic loop between repeats I and II of the α1 subunit. Mutations within this motif severely interfered with β binding to α1 and with β-induced current stimulation (13De Waard M. Scott V.E.S. Pragnell M. Campbell K.P. FEBS Lett. 1996; 380: 272-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The β subunit exists in several isoforms and splice variants in different tissues (14Isom L.L. DeJongh K.S. Catterall W.A. Neuron. 1994; 12: 1183-1194Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). Coexpression of various combinations of α1 subunits and accessory subunits in heterologous expression systems has contributed much of our present knowledge about the functions of the subunits. Whereas the α1 subunit alone is sufficient for the expression of functional Ca2+channels (15Mikami A. Imoto K. Tanabe T. Niidome T. Mori Y. Takeshima H. Narumiya S. Numa S. Nature. 1989; 340: 141-145Crossref Scopus (767) Google Scholar, 16Perez-Reyes E. Kim H.S. Lacerda A.E. Horne W. Wei X. Rampe D. Campbell K.P. Brown A.M. Birnbaumer L. Nature. 1989; 340: 233-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar), additional expression of α2δ and β subunits increases the incorporation of functional channels into the plasma membrane and modulates the current properties (17Lacerda A.E.

J. 1992; 63: 1421-1424Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). β coexpression has been demonstrated to enhance the Ca2+ and DHP binding capacity of α1C (20Mitterdorfer J. Froschmayr M. Grabner M. Striessnig J. Glossmann H. FEBS Lett. 1994; 352: 141-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), to elevate current magnitudes, and increase gating charges (21Josephson I.R. Varadi G. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: 1285-1293Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). A multitude of qualitative effects of β on Ca2+ currents has been reported. However, they are as variable as the subunit combinations and expression systems used for these studies (14Isom L.L. DeJongh K.S. Catterall W.A. Neuron. 1994; 12: 1183-1194Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar, 22Hofmann F. Biel M. Flockerzi V. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1994; 17: 399-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). The most compelling evidence for functional modulation of current properties by β are the increase in open probability in single-channel recordings of α1C co-transfected with β2a inXenopus oocytes (23Wakamori M. Mikala G. Schwartz A. Yatani A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 196: 1170-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 24Shistik E. Ivanina T. Puri T. Hosey M. Dascal N. J. Physiol. 1995; 489: 55-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) and in mammalian cells, a modulation of current densities but not of gating charges upon coexpression of α1C with a mutated β2asubunit (25Chien A.J. Zhao X. Shirokov R.E. Puri T.S. Chang C.F. Sun D. Rios E. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30036-30044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). As possible mechanisms for modulatory effects of β, an improved intramolecular coupling (26Neely A. Wei X. Olcese R. Birnbaumer L. Stefani E. Science. 1993; 262: 575-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) and a stabilization of Ca2+ coordination sites in the channel pore have been suggested (20Mitterdorfer J. Froschmayr M. Grabner M. Striessnig J. Glossmann H. FEBS Lett. 1994; 352: 141-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In several recent studies, the mechanism by which β increases channel expression in the plasma membrane has been directly addressed. In transiently transfected HEK cells, it was shown with immunocytochemistry that the cardiac β2a subunit is preferentially localized in the plasma membrane and that coexpression of the cardiac α1C with β2a causes the translocation of α1C into the membrane (25Chien A.J. Zhao X. Shirokov R.E. Puri T.S. Chang C.F. Sun D. Rios E. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30036-30044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). A similar translocation of a neuronal α1A subunit into the plasma membrane was accomplished by four different β isoforms: β1b, β2a, β3b, and β4 (27Brice N.L. Berrow N.S. Campbell V. Page K.M. Brickley K. Tedder I. Dolphin A.C. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1997; 9: 749-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Interestingly, not all of the β subunits that are able to induce α1A translocation were localized in the plasma membrane. Only β1b and β2a but not β3b and β4 showed a plasma membrane association. Palmitoylation at two N-terminal-located cysteines is a possible mechanism by which β2a could be anchored to the plasma membrane. However, mutation of these cysteines that blocked palmitoylation of β2a expressed in tsA201 cells caused a failure of current stimulation but not of channel incorporation as seen in recordings of gating charges (28Chien A.J. Carr K.M. Shirokov R.E. Rios E. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26465-26468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). The skeletal muscle l-type Ca2+ channel is distinct from other voltage-gated Ca2+ channels with respect to its organization in the triad junction (29Flucher B.E. Franzini-Armstrong C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8101-8106Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), with respect to its function in excitation-contraction coupling (4Rios E. Ma J. Gonzales A. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1991; 12: 127-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), and with respect to modulation of its channel properties (14Isom L.L. DeJongh K.S. Catterall W.A. Neuron. 1994; 12: 1183-1194Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar, 30Johnson B.D. Brousal J.P. Peterson B.Z. Gallombardo P.A. Hockerman G.H. Lai Y. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 1243-1255Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Whether interactions between the skeletal muscle α1 and β subunits expressed in mammalian non-muscle cells also differ from those of other isoforms is not known. Here we report isoform-specific effects of β1a and β2a on the subcellular distribution and current stimulation upon coexpression with α1S in tsA201 cells. A mutation in the β interaction domain of α1S interferes with the stable association of the subunits but not with the β1a-induced stimulation of Ca2+ currents. tsA201 cells, a HEK cell subclone stably transfected with the SV40 large T-antigen, were plated and proliferated in F-12 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were grown to 80% confluency before passing. For structural analysis (green fluorescent protein (GFP) and immunocytochemistry), cells were plated at dilutions of about 1:10 onto poly-l-lysine-coated 13-mm round coverglasses and transfected on the following day (see below) when cells reached 30% confluency. For patch clamp analysis, cells were plated in 35-mm culture dishes at a dilution of 1:10. After transfection at about 50% confluency, cells were replated onto poly-l-lysine-coated 25-mm round coverglasses at dilutions between 1:5 and 1:10 to get isolated cells for patch clamp recordings on the following day. Transfections were carried out with a liposomal transfection reagent (DOTAP, Boehringer Mannheim) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The total amount of DNA used per 35-mm culture dish was 10 μg, 5–8 μg of which was specific DNA (expression plasmids encoding α1S constructs, β, and GFP); the rest was filled up with inert DNA (pUC18; Ref. 31Norrander J. Kempe T. Messing J. Gene. 1985; 26: 101-106Crossref Scopus (1535) Google Scholar). In co-transfection experiments, two or more expression plasmids were combined at equimolar concentrations. This resulted in coexpression of βGFP with any α1S construct in approximately 70% of βGFP-transfected cells. The liposome/DNA mixture was diluted in 1.5 ml of F-12 medium and then added to the culture. On the following day, the cells were processed for immunocytochemistry or replated for patch clamp analysis. The coding sequence of the rabbit α1S-cDNA was excised from the plasmid pCAC6 (33Tanabe T. Beam K.G. Powell J.A. Numa S. Nature. 1988; 336: 134-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar) by HindIII digestion and inserted into the expression plasmid pcDNA3 (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). Mutations were introduced into α1S by site-directed mutagenesis of the α1S-pcDNA3 using the splicing by overlap extension technique (32Horton R.M. Hunt H.D. Ho S.N. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene. 1989; 77: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (2641) Google Scholar). In a first step, a SacII (nt 81 of α1S)-XhoI (nt 2652 of α1S) fragment of the α1S-cDNA was subcloned from the α1S-pcDNA3 into the pBluescript SK(−) (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). In a second step, the mutations in the α1S were generated by using different mutagenic primers: 1, the sense primer 5′-AAGCAGCAGCTAGAGGAGGACCTTCGGGGCTCCATGAGCTGGAT-3′ for a single substitution in the α1S in position 366 from tyrosine to serine (α1S-Y366S); 2, the sense primer 5′-GCCAAGTCCAGGGGAACCTTCCTGAGAGAAGGAAAGCTG-3′ for a 30-amino acid deletion mutation in the α1S from position 351 to position 380 (α1S-Δ351–380); and 3, the sense primer 5′-GCCAAGTCCAGGGGAACCTTCTGGATCACGCAGGGCGAG-3′ for an 18-amino acid deletion mutation in the α1S from position 351 to position 368 (α1S-Δ351–368). To facilitate the identification of positive clones, a PvuII site (nt 1071 of α1S) was eliminated by a silent mutation in the mutagenic primers. The mutated α1S fragments were inserted into the α1S-pcDNA3 after digestion with SacII and XhoI. All mutations were verified by sequence analysis. The construction of a β1a-GFP C-terminal fusion protein required five steps. In the first step the GFP-cDNA was excised from the GFP-pRK5 by using a BamHI (nt 2 of GFP) and aHindIII site (nt 1671 of GFP-pRK5) and ligated into the pBluescript SK(−). Secondly, the SacI (nt 695 of β1a)-BamHI (multiple cloning site of pSVL) fragment of the rabbit β1a-cDNA from pSVL (20Mitterdorfer J. Froschmayr M. Grabner M. Striessnig J. Glossmann H. FEBS Lett. 1994; 352: 141-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) was inserted into the GFP-pBluescript SK(−). In the third step, a fragment consisting of the 3′ terminus of the β1a-cDNA fused to the 5′ terminus of the GFP-cDNA including aBamHI restriction site was constructed by PCR using the fusion primer: 5′-CTCATGGGATCCATCATGGCGTGCTCCTGCTGTTGGGGCACC-3′. In the fourth step, NarI (nt 1147 of β1a) and BamHI (nt 2 of GFP) digestion of the polymerase chain reaction product allowed insertion into the pBluescript SK(−) subclone containing the β1a- and GFP-cDNAs. Finally, the fused β1a-GFP fragment was inserted into the β1a-pcDNA3 after digestion withBstXI (nt 834 of β1a) and ApaI (multiple cloning site of pcDNA3). The integrity of the β1a-GFP transition was verified by cDNA sequence analysis. Paraformaldehyde-fixed cultures were immuno-stained as described previously (37Flucher B.E. Andrews S.B. Fleischer S. Marks A.R. Caswell A.H. Powell J.A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1161-1174Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). For double-labeling with GFP, Texas red-conjugated antibodies (Jackson Immuno Research, West Grove, PA) were used to exclude bleed-through between the red and the green channels. Working dilutions and the sources of primary antibodies are listed in TableII. Samples were evaluated on a Zeiss Axiovert microscope with epifluorescence and phase contrast optics and documented on 35-mm high speed black and white film. The antibodies were carefully characterized for their use in immunofluorescence experiments in previous studies (37Flucher B.E. Andrews S.B. Fleischer S. Marks A.R. Caswell A.H. Powell J.A. J.

Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.J. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15149) Google Scholar). Cultures grown on 25-mm-round coverglasses were mounted in a recording chamber and viewed with a 16× phase contrast multi-immersion lens on a Zeiss Axiovert microscope. Fluorescent cells (βGFP or GFP-transfected) were selected for recording, except for controls with nontransfected cells. The bath solution contained (40 mm BaCl2, 100 mm tetraethylammonium chloride, 10 mm HEPES, and 5 μm (±)-BayK8644 (adjusted to pH 7.4 using tetrathylammonium hydroxide). Patch pipettes pulled from borosilicate glass and fire-polished were filled with 130 mm cesium aspartate, 10 mm HEPES, 2 mm MgATP, 2 mm CsEGTA, and 0.5 mmMgCl2 (adjusted to pH 7.4 with CsOH). Resistances of the patch pipettes were between 4 and 7 megaohms. An Axopatch 200A patch clamp amplifier controlled by the software pClamp 6.0 (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA) was used for all recordings. Capacitative currents were compensated using the built-in analog circuits (series resistance error was corrected for 80%). Leak resistance in the cell-attached mode was normally larger (8 gigaohms). Current data were low-pass Bessel-filtered with 1 kHz and sampled at 0.5 kHz with an IBM-compatible PC. To test cells for the expression of barium currents, a voltage ramp protocol was used (from −80 mV to +70 mV over a period of 750 ms) without using any leak current subtraction. Under these conditions, the current detection threshold, indicated by an inward peak in the current trace (see, e.g. Fig. 6 a), was about 10 pA. Nontransfected tsA201 cells or cells transfected only with βGFP showed one or, in rare cases, two distinct types of inward barium currents. One with the current peak at −11.5 mV ± 2.1 mV S.D. during the voltage ramp and with fast inactivation kinetics characteristic for T-type current; a second current peaking at 8.7 mV ± 5.1 mV S.D. (see also Ref. 43Berjukov S. Doring F. Froschmayr M. Grabner M. Glossmann H. Hering S. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 118: 748-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). To exclude a possible interference with the analysis of the heterologously expressed currents, any current peaking below +30 mV was rejected from the analysis. Only cells transfected with the α1S constructs showed inward barium currents, with the current peak located between +30 mV and + 50 mV of the voltage ramp. These high voltage-activated currents were therefore attributed to the expression of one of the α1S constructs. For a further check, I/V curves were determined for those cells showing stable recordings with a high current density using a voltage step protocol with a holding potential of −80 mV and 1 s test pulses of −40 mV in 10 mV increments to +80 mV (using a −P/4 leak subtraction protocol). The I/V curves and current kinetics (activation time constant τact = 18.2 ms ± 3.5 ms S.E., inactivation time constant τact = 486 ms ± 41 ms S.E. at +40 mV test potential and α1S + βGFP coexpression; see Fig. 6 b) showed similar characteristics when α1S and β1awere coexpressed in l-cells (18Varadi G. Lory P. Schultz D. Varadi M. Schwartz A. Nature. 1991; 352: 159-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar) or in myotubes (44Strube C. Beurg M. Powers P.A. Gregg R.G. Coronado R. Biophys. J. 1996; 71: 2531-2543Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). An expression plasmid encoding a fusion protein of the β1a subunit of the skeletal muscle DHP receptor and GFP, called βGFP, has been constructed as a tool for studying the subcellular distribution of β1a transiently expressed in tsA201 cells. βGFP aids in the identification of cells expressing the β1a subunit and allows its direct localization. Double-labeling of transfected tsA201 cells with GFP and immunofluorescence using an antibody against the β subunit resulted in identical distribution patterns of both stains (Fig. 1, a and b). Transfection with the βGFP fusion protein (Fig. 1 b) or transfection with the wild type β1a (Fig. 1 e) also resulted in identical β immuno-labeling patterns. Thus, βGFP fluorescence gives a true picture of the β1alocalization, and using the fusion protein instead of the wild type β1a, has no undesired effects on its subcellular localization. This was still true when the β distribution was altered upon coexpression with the α1S subunit (see below). Moreover, electrophysiological analysis showed that effects of βGFP and wild type β1a on Ca2+ currents were indistinguishable in control experiments in which the cardiac α1C was coexpressed with βGFP or β1a 2B. Neuhuber, U. Gerster, and B. E. Flucher, unpublished results. and upon coexpression of both β constructs with α1S in dysgenic skeletal myotubes (53Neuhuber B. Gerster U. Döring F. Glossmann H. Tanabe T. Flucher B.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, our βGFP construct can be used in place of β1a, with the advantage of allowing the direct observation of β1a expression and localization in transiently transfected cells. The distribution pattern of βGFP when expressed by itself in tsA201 cells was always diffuse and evenly distributed throughout the cytoplasm (Fig. 1 a). The label did not appear to be specifically associated with any membrane system or cytoplasmic structure. Only the nuclei and vacuolar structures excluded the βGFP stain. This was different from the fluorescence signal obtained by expressing GFP alone, which was also diffusely distributed throughout the cytoplasm but in addition labeled the nuclei (Fig. 1 d). The α1S subunit of the DHP receptor expressed in tsA201 cells showed a different subcellular distribution. Localizing α1S with a specific antibody showed that it was contained in a dense network of a tubular membrane compartment that extended throughout the entire cytoplasm (Fig. 2,a, c, and e). The tubular/reticular network was very dense in the perinuclear region, and occasionally the nuclear envelope was also labeled. The reticular nature of the compartment could be best seen in thin regions of the cells. Based on these structural characteristics, the α1S-containing compartment is identified as the ER. Other cytoplasmic compartments that could have been recognized by their morphology, most importantly, the plasma membrane, were not labeled with the α1Santibody. Transfection of tsA201 cells with α1Sconstructs in which the β interaction domain has either been deleted or mutated showed the same subcellular distribution in the ER (see Fig. 2, a, c, and e). βGFP expressed alone was diffusely distributed throughout the cytoplasm (Fig. 3, a and b). However, when βGFP was coexpressed with the wild type α1S subunit of the DHP receptor, the β1asubunit became localized in the tubular/reticular membrane system, presumably the ER (Fig. 3, c and d). The cytoplasm was essentially free of diffuse βGFP fluorescence, and no staining of the plasma membrane could be observed. Double-labeling of βGFP and an antibody against α1S showed a colocalization of β1a and α1S in the ER (see Fig. 4, a and b). To test whether this redistribution of βGFP was due to its direct association with the α1S subunit, three α1S constructs with mutations in the β interaction domain have been generated. In α1S-Δ351–380, the entire β interaction domain has been deleted; in α1S-Δ351–368, the N-terminal portion of the β interaction domain has been deleted; in α1S-Y366S, tyrosine in position 366 has been substituted with serine. Equivalent mutations in the β interaction domain of α1A have been shown to inhibit binding of β1b and current stimulation (12Pragnell M. De Waard M. Mori Y. Tanabe T. Snutch T.P. Campbell K.P. Nature. 1994; 368: 67-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). If the translocation of βGFP from the cytoplasm to the ER was a result of a direct association of β1a to α1S, mutations in the β interaction domain of α1S should inhibit the observed translocation of βGFP.Figure 4Comparison of the subcellular localization of β1a and α1S in tsA201 cells coexpressing βGFP with the wild type and mutant α1S subunits.β1a localization is shown with GFP fluorescence (upper row), and α1S localization is shown with immunofluorescence (lower row). βGFP and wild type α1S are colocalized in a reticular cytoplasmic membrane system (a and b). α1S-Y366S (d) and α1S-Δ351–380 (f) are both localized in the reticular membrane system; however, in these cells βGFP is not associated with the reticular membrane system but diffusely distributed in the cytoplasm (c and e).Insets show a small field of a thin area of the cell at 2-fold magnification.

Quantitative analysis of the βGFP distribution when expressed alone or in combination with either one of the α1S mutants showed that 376 of 441 (85.3%) analyzed cells co-transfected with α1S had a clearly identifiable ER distribution of βGFP, but in none of the cells co-transfected with α1S-Y366S or α1S-Δ351–380 was βGFP found in the ER (Table III). The small fraction of cells in βGFP/α1S co-transfected cultures that did not show an ER distribution of βGFP most likely represents cells that only expressed βGFP and not α1S and cells with an overall poor morphology. The differential distribution of βGFP upon coexpression with the different α1Sconstructs was verified by immunolocalization of β1a(Fig. 3, b, d, f, and h). Immuno-labeling of β1a or βGFP gave the same distribution patterns as seen with intrinsic βGFP fluorescence (Fig. 3, a, c, e, and g). 348 of 447 (77.9%) analyzed cells co-transfected with βGFP and α1S, but none of the cells co-transfected with either one of the α1S mutants showed β immuno-localized in the ER. Since the two deletion mutants, α1S-Δ351–368 and α1S-Δ351–380, gave identical results in all experiments, quantitative data and figures of only α1S-Δ351–380 will be shown in this article as repres"
https://openalex.org/W2090853676,"The Cry1A insecticidal crystal protein (protoxin) from six subspecies of Bacillus thuringiensis as well as the Cry1Aa, Cry1Ab, and Cry1Ac proteins cloned in Escherichia coli was found to contain 20-kilobase pair DNA. Only the N-terminal toxic moiety of the protoxin was found to interact with the DNA. Analysis of the crystal gave approximately 3 base pairs of DNA per molecule of protoxin, indicating that only a small region of the N-terminal toxic moiety interacts with the DNA. It is proposed that the DNA-protoxin complex is virus-like in structure with a central DNA core surrounded by protein interacting with the DNA with the peripheral ends of the C-terminal region extending outward. It is shown that this structure accounts for the unusual proteolysis observed in the generation of toxin in which it appears that peptides are removed by obligatory sequential cleavages starting from the C terminus of the protoxin. Activation of the protoxin by spruce budworm (Choristoneura fumiferana) gut juice is shown to proceed through intermediates consisting of protein-DNA complexes. Larval trypsin initially converts the 20-kilobase pair DNA-protoxin complex to a 20-kilobase pair DNA-toxin complex, which is subsequently converted to a 100-base pair DNA-toxin complex by a gut nuclease and ultimately to the DNA-free toxin."
https://openalex.org/W2134514653,"Murine ZFP-37 is a member of the large family of C2H2 type zinc finger proteins. It is characterized by a truncated NH2-terminal Krüppel-associated box and is thought to play a role in transcriptional regulation. During development Zfp-37mRNA is most abundant in the developing central nervous system, and in the adult mouse expression is restricted largely to testis and brain. Here we show that at the protein level ZFP-37 is detected readily in neurons of the adult central nervous system but hardly in testis. In brain ZFP-37 is associated with nucleoli and appears to contact heterochromatin. Mouse and human ZFP-37 have a basic histone H1-like linker domain, located between KRAB and zinc finger regions, which binds double-stranded DNA. Thus we suggest that ZFP-37 is a structural protein of the neuronal nucleus which plays a role in the maintenance of specialized chromatin domains.

Thus we suggest that ZFP-37 is a structural protein of the neuronal nucleus which plays a role in the maintenance of specialized chromatin domains. It was proposed recently that the large family of nucleic acid-binding C2H2 type zinc finger genes is divided into two classes (1Pieler T. Bellefroid E. Mol. Biol. Rep. 1994; 20: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). One consists of zinc finger genes that encode small protein families with evolutionary conserved finger clusters of three to five units. These proteins bind to similar DNA sequences and play an important role either as housekeeping proteins or as regulatory factors during development. Examples of this class of zinc finger genes are Gli-1, Krox-20,WT1, Egr-1, and Sp1. The second class consists of C2H2 zinc finger genes, which often contain more than 10 zinc finger units/gene. Because some of these genes are not well conserved among species it was speculated that they must have arisen late in evolution. For example ZNF91, which encodes a protein with 35 zinc fingers, is found duplicated many times in man and primates, but the gene cluster is undetectable in rodents (2Bellefroid E.J. Marine J.C. Matera A.G. Bourguignon C. Desai T. Healy K.C. Bray-Ward P. Martial J.A. Ihle J.N. Ward D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10757-10761Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The function of the protein products encoded by this class of genes could be to bind to repetitive DNA sequences (1Pieler T. Bellefroid E. Mol. Biol. Rep. 1994; 20: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Common structural motifs other than the zinc finger characterize the second class of genes. These include the finger-associated box (FAX; Ref. 3Knochel W. Poting A. Koster M. el Baradi T. Nietfeld W. Bouwmeester T. Pieler T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The KRAB region is almost always found at the NH2 terminus of Krüppel-like zinc finger proteins (ZFPs). The KRAB domain is estimated to be present in about one-third of all C2H2 type zinc fingers (5Bellefroid E.J. Poncelet D.A. Lecocq P.J. Revelant O. Martial J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3608-3612Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar) but has also been found in two non-zinc finger genes (6Crew A.J. Clark J. Fisher C. Gill S. Grimer R. Chand A. Shipley J. Gusterson B.A. Cooper C.S. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2333-2340Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). It has been subdivided into a conserved A region and a more degenerate B domain, which are often encoded by two different exons. Accumulating evidence supports a function for the KRAB domain in transcriptional repression (7Margolin J.F. Friedman J.R. Meyer W.K. Vissing H. Thiesen H.J. Rauscher III, F.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4514-4518Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Because of this the KRAB ZFPs are generally assumed to be DNA-binding transcriptional regulators. We are interested in neuronal nuclear architecture and are investigating the molecular mechanisms that underlie the adaptations in gene expression and protein synthesis patterns allowing these postmitotic cells to function in complex neuronal circuitries. The murine Zfp-37 gene encodes a protein that potentially plays a role in these processes. It was described originally as a gene transcribed exclusively in testis and encoding a protein with 12 zinc fingers at its COOH terminus (11Nelki D. Dudley K. Cunningham P. Akhavan M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3655Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 12Burke P.S. Wolgemuth D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 2827-2834Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). We then showed that it is a member of the KRAB zinc finger gene family and that it is not only expressed in testis but also in the developing and adult central nervous system and, at lower levels, in a number of other tissues (13Mazarakis N. Michalovich D. Karis A. Grosveld F. Galjart N. Genomics. 1996; 33: 247-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In adult brain, the Zfp-37 message is specific to neurons, with regional differences in expression levels found throughout the brain. Multiple protein isoforms of the Zfp-37 gene can be generated through the use of different promoters and alternative splicing of pre-mRNAs. The major isoforms have a predicted molecular mass of 67 kDa, and they contain a truncated KRAB-A and a complete KRAB-B region. The minor form is 62 kDa and lacks the truncated KRAB-A region. By virtue of sequence elements located in its 3′-untranslated region Zfp-37 was predicted to be an immediate-early response gene (13Mazarakis N. Michalovich D. Karis A. Grosveld F. Galjart N. Genomics. 1996; 33: 247-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). This combination of highly regulated expression in neurons of a potential immediate-early transcription factor provided the basis for a further analysis of the role of Zfp-37. Here we show that ZFP-37 isoforms of ∼67 kDa are expressed in vivo and that they contain the truncated KRAB-A region, indicating that the protein might function as a transcriptional repressor. ZFP-37 is detected in neurons of the adult central nervous system but hardly in testis. In the brain ZFP-37 localizes to constitutive heterochromatin attached to nucleoli, and/or it decorates the interior of the nucleolus. Furthermore, both mouse and human ZFP-37 contain a DNA binding domain that is located in the basic amino acid stretch between KRAB and zinc finger regions. This domain has a preference for double-stranded DNA, and it resembles the basic COOH-terminal DNA binding motif of histone H1. Together, these data suggest that ZFP-37 is involved in the functional specialization of neuronal nuclear domains. Mouse brain-derivedZfp-37 cDNA (13Mazarakis N. Michalovich D. Karis A. Grosveld F. Galjart N. Genomics. 1996; 33: 247-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) was digested with restriction enzymes to give DNA fragments suitable for subcloning into the bacterial expression plasmids pGEX2T and pGEX3X (Pharmacia). The following constructs were generated initially: GST-ZFP-37 (containing nucleotides 148–1870 of the mouse Zfp-37 cDNA sequence), GST-K(RAB)A (containing nucleotides 148–210), GST-KL1 (containing nucleotides 148–555), GST-3ZF (containing nucleotides 1550–1870), and GST-8ZF (containing nucleotides 1160–1870; see also Fig. 2 A). Subsequent constructs (see Fig. 4 A) were generated by PCR (14Saiki R.K. Gelfand D.H. Stoffel S. Scharf S.J. Higuchi R. Horn G.T. Mullis K.B. Erlich H.A. Science. 1988; 239: 487-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (13517) Google Scholar) using Zfp-37-specific primers with anchored restriction enzyme sites. The linker regions of rKr2 (U27186), RNU67082, mouse kid-1 (L77247), NK10 (X79828), and ZFP60 (U48721) were taken from the data base and primers designed for reverse transcriptase-PCR which yielded the complete linker region in between KRAB and zinc finger domains. The hL1 fusion protein was also obtained by PCR, using a human Zfp-37 cDNA clone as template. 2S. Dreyer, A. Winterpacht, and B. Lee, unpublished results. PCR fragments were subcloned into pGEX, and clones were verified by sequence analysis. Bacterial fusion proteins were induced and purified as described (15Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5047) Google Scholar). Except for GST-ZFP-37, all fusion proteins were made in large quantities.Figure 4Minimal DNA binding domain in ZFP-37 linker. Panel A, the linker region of mouse ZFP-37 was divided into increasingly smaller segments, and each fragment was cloned in-frame with GST, using PCR amplification with Zfp-37-specific primers (B1–B18). The amino acid sequences of the different linker fragments are shown in the left panel. The hL1 sequence is from the human ZFP-37 linker. The relative DNA binding strength of each fusion protein is given (+++ indicates very strong binding; − indicates no binding); it was determined by electrophoresis mobility shift assay, similar to the experiment depicted in Fig. 3. A representative bandshift with a 3 μm concentration of each fusion protein and 5 ng of a 140-bp DNA probe is presented to theright. S, slot; fp, free probe. Control probe incubations without fusion protein and with GST only are shown in the left two lanes. Panel B, on the basis of the minimal core DNA binding region defined in panel A, three peptides were synthesized containing the complete minimal DNA binding domain (Pwt) or mutated/truncated forms of this domain (Pmut and Pshort, respectively). Increasing amounts of each peptide were incubated with the probe described above, and protein-DNA complexes were analyzed by bandshift. Panel C, to define the DNA binding properties of Pwt, affinity coelectrophoresis was carried out. The 140-bp DNA probe used above was loaded into a wide slot of a 1% agarose gel. Upon migration the probe encounters perpendicularly placed lanes with increasing amounts of Pwt, which will retard the DNA. After electrophoresis the gels were dried and exposed.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) DNA fragments for bandshift assays were isolated using standard procedures (16Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The 140-bp probe used in most bandshift experiments contains 106 bp from intron 3 of theZfp-37 gene. This fragment was PCR amplified and cloned into the EcoRV site of Bluescript (Stratagene). A 140-bp fragment used for bandshift analysis was generated by excision withEcoRI and SalI. Radioactive probes for the Southwestern analysis were made as described (17Feinberg A.P. Vogelstein B. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 132: 6-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (16651) Google Scholar). Southwestern assays were performed as published previously (18Sukegawa J. Blobel G. Cell. 1993; 72: 29-38Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). For bandshift experiments, GST fusion proteins were purified with the use of glutathione beads (Pharmacia). Before bandshift proteins were diluted to the required concentration in binding buffer (5 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm EDTA, 25 mm NaCl, 1% Ficoll), occasionally in the presence of 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. Various concentrations of fusion protein were mixed with 2–10 ng of probe in binding buffer and incubated for 20 min. When required, cold competitor DNA was added simultaneously to the samples. Protein-DNA complexes were resolved on 4% acrylamide gels. After electrophoresis, the gels were dried and exposed to PhosphorImager screens (Molecular Dynamics). Affinity coelectrophoresis was carried out as described previously (19Lim W.A. Sauer R.T. Lander A.D. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 208: 196-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar,20Nedved M.L. Moe G.R. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 227: 80-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Increasing concentrations of the Pwt peptide were used for this analysis, together with 0.5 ng of the 140-bp DNA probe. Gel electrophoresis was carried out in 1% low melting agarose gels in Tris acetate buffer containing 50 mm NaCl. Gels were dried after electrophoresis and exposed to PhosphorImager screens. Peptides were synthesized according to the solid phase method (21Erickson B.W. Merrifield R.B. Neurath H. Hill R.L. The Proteins. 3rd Ed. Academic Press, New York1976: 255-527Crossref Google Scholar). The sequences of Pwt, Pshort, and Pmut peptides are shown in Fig. 4 B. In addition we made a Pwt peptide with an extra cysteine residue at its NH2 terminus. 2 mg of this sulfhydryl-containing peptide was conjugated to 2 mg of maleimide-activated bovine serum albumin using the Imject activated immunogen conjugation kit (Pierce). Purified bacterial fusion proteins or conjugated peptide preparations were injected into rabbits, in a suspension containing Freund's incomplete adjuvant (Difco). After three boosts with the respective antigens, antibodies were obtained and tested on Western blots containing COS-1 cell extracts. Antibodies were purified using protein A-Sepharose (Pharmacia) and, if needed, subsequently affinity purified on filter strips containing the various bacterial fusion proteins. MeCP2 antibodies (22Nan X. Tate P. Li E. Bird A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 414-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar) and histone H1 antibodies (23Parseghian M.H. Clark R.F. Hauser L.J. Dvorkin N. Harris D.A. Hamkalo B.A. Chromosome Res. 1993; 1: 127-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) were kind gifts of Drs. A. Bird and M. Parseghian, respectively. Nuclear extracts from embryonic and adult mouse tissues were made as published (24Lichtsteiner S. Wuarin J. Schibler U. Cell. 1987; 51: 963-973Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar) and protein concentrations measured using the BCA assay (Pierce). Total protein extracts from COS-1 cells or tissues were made by freeze-thawing and sonication of cell suspensions followed by boiling in SDS sample buffer containing dithiothreitol. About 25–50 μg of (nuclear) protein lysate was loaded per lane on SDS-polyacrylamide gels (16Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). After electrophoresis, proteins were blotted, and filters were blocked for 16 h in 50 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl (Tris-buffered saline), and 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20 (Sigma), containing 3% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (Sigma). Antibody incubations were done for 2–16 h, in the same buffer. Antibody-antigen interactions were detected according to standard procedures (16Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). For ZFP-37 overexpression studies, two constructs, encoding different isoforms of mouse ZFP-37, were subcloned into a derivative of the mammalian expression vector pCD-X (25Okayama H. Berg P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1983; 3: 280-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). In one clone a genomic fragment was linked to the full-length Zfp-37 cDNA sequence to enable translation initiation from the first methionine in the mouse cDNA sequence (13Mazarakis N. Michalovich D. Karis A. Grosveld F. Galjart N. Genomics. 1996; 33: 247-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The second construct encompassed nucleotides 145–2377 of theZfp-37 cDNA (13Mazarakis N. Michalovich D. Karis A. Grosveld F. Galjart N. Genomics. 1996; 33: 247-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), to allow only translation initiation from the second methionine in the mouse cDNA. To verify the localization of overexpressed ZFP-37, the protein was fused to a modified form of green fluorescent protein (26Chalfie M. Tu Y. Euskirchen G. Ward W.W. Prasher D.C. Science. 1994; 263: 802-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (5540) Google Scholar, 27Cubitt A.B. Heim R. Adams S.R. Boyd A.E. Gross L.A. Tsien R.Y. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 448-455Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1207) Google Scholar), called hGFP-S65T (CLONTECH). hGFP-S65T was further mutagenized at 3 amino acid residues (T65S, Y66H, Y145F) with the transformer site-directed mutagenesis kit (CLONTECH) to yield blue fluorescent protein, or BFP (28Heim R. Tsien R.Y. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 178-182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1213) Google Scholar). A cDNA subclone of human ribosomal protein S6 (29Schmidt C. Lipsius E. Kruppa J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1875-1885Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), which encodes a nucleolus-localizing sequence (NoLS), was then linked in-frame to BFP. COS-1 cells (30Gluzman Y. Cell. 1981; 23: 175-182Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1460) Google Scholar) were transfected as described previously (31Galjart N.J. Gillemans N. Harris A. van der Horst G.T. Verheijen F.W. Galjaard H. d'Azzo A. Cell. 1988; 54: 755-764Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). After 24 h cells were fixed using 3% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline and permeabilized with 0.05% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were incubated subsequently with affinity-purified anti-ZFP-37 antibodies followed by a detection step with FITC-labeled goat anti-rabbit antibody (Nordic Immunological Laboratories, Tilburg, The Netherlands). All antibodies gave similar results in these experiments, except the one against GST-KRAB-A, which did detect COS-1 cell-derived ZFP-37, produced from the first methionine, but not ZFP-37 produced from the second methionine (data not shown). The ZFP-37-GFP and NoLS-BFP proteins were detected in live transfected COS-1 cells using an Olympus IX-70 inverted microscope with appropriate filterblocks (Chromacorp). Images were captured with a Sony 3CCD color video camera and digital still recorder. For the detection of ZFP-37 in mouse tissues, wild type or transgenic mice were anesthetized using 50 μl of Hypnodil (Janssen Pharmaceutica) and perfused transcardially with 50 ml of saline solution followed by 50 ml of freshly prepared 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline. Tissues were removed after perfusion and postfixed in the same solution for 1–2 h at 4 °C. Tissues were embedded in paraffin (Merck 1.07157), and 10-μm sections were cut on a microtome. Sections were spread onto Mentzel Superfrost slides and dried. Paraffin was removed using xylene, and sections were rehydrated through an ethanol series. Subsequently, slides were immersed into 10 mm sodium citrate buffer (pH 6.0), microwave treated (3 × 5 min at 600 watts with a 5-min rest period in between), and cooled down slowly in the same buffer. Sections were then rinsed with 10 mm Tris (pH 7.6), 50 mm NaCl (TN buffer), followed by three washes with the same buffer containing 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20 (TNT buffer). Blocking of nonspecific sites was carried out for 2–3 h at room temperature using 3% bovine serum albumin in TNT buffer. Antibody incubations were done overnight at 4 °C in the same buffer. Sections were then washed in TNT buffer and incubated with FITC-labeled secondary antibody. After further washing, sections were dried and mounted with DAPI/DABCO/glycerol medium. Recently the gene encoding the human counterpart of ZFP-37 was isolated and characterized. Comparison of the protein product with murine ZFP-37 reveals that these proteins are almost identical in their zinc finger domains (Fig. 1 A). Therefore, the molecular partners of this region could be conserved between mouse and man. Upstream of the zinc finger region the similarity between mouse and human proteins drops to ∼50%. In addition, human ZFP-37 contains a longer NH2-terminal region upstream of the KRAB domain. This raises the question of whether these less conserved regions serve the same function in mouse and man. However, alignment of the ZFP-37 linker, located between KRAB and zinc finger domains, to the Swissprot data base revealed the presence of a small basic region in both linkers, embedded in a framework of alanine and proline residues, which resembles the COOH-terminal tail of a number of histone H1 variants and other nuclear and nucleolar proteins (Fig. 1 B). Domains of this kind may bind to the minor groove of DNA in a nonspecific manner (for review, see Ref. 32Churchill M.E. Travers A.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 92-97Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Thus, the structure of both murine and human ZFP-37 predicts the presence of two nucleic acid binding motifs: a highly conserved zinc finger region located at the COOH terminus of both proteins and a histone H1-like region located between the zinc finger and KRAB domains. Binding site selection experiments have been developed to identify high affinity DNA binding sites for transcription factors (33Pollock R. Treisman R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 6197-6204Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). This protocol has also been applied successfully in the case of multi-zinc finger proteins of the C2H2 type (e.g. Ref. 34Arranz V. Harper F. Florentin Y. Puvion E. Kress M. Ernoult-Lange M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2116-2126Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). To identify ZFP-37-responsive sequence(s) using this approach, bacterial fusion proteins were made, containing either full-length ZFP-37 or truncated parts of the protein, linked to GST. Initially, five different fusion proteins were made (Fig. 2 A, upper panel), all of which are soluble (data not shown). Except for the full-length ZFP-37-GST fusion protein, each polypeptide was produced in large quantities and could be purified as a single species using affinity chromatography (data not shown). However, none of the five proteins yielded a specific DNA binding site when tested with the selection protocol (data not shown). The DNA binding capacities of the histone H1-like domain and zinc finger region were therefore investigated in a Southwestern blot assay (Fig. 2 A). Bacterial proteins were allowed to renature on a blot in the presence or absence of zinc and incubated with different radioactively labeled DNA fragments. This analysis demonstrates that the zinc finger region of ZFP-37 does have the capacity to bind DNA but only when the fingers have been allowed to renature in the presence of zinc (Fig. 2 A, lower left panel). Because multiple probes were bound (data not shown) we conclude that in this assay the zinc fingers bind DNA nonspecifically. In accordance with our prediction, the fusion protein called KL1, which contains the histone H1-like domain described above, is also able to bind DNA, in both the presence and absence of zinc chelators, whereas GST or GST-KA does not bind (Fig. 2 A, lower left and right panels). Thus ZFP-37 indeed harbors two different regions with the potential to bind DNA. Conservation of the DNA binding activity of mouse ZFP-37 in the human protein would indicate that this is a physiologically relevant feature of ZFP-37. Hence the domain from human ZFP-37, encompassing the histone H1-like stretch (hL1, see Fig. 1 A), was fused in-frame to GST and tested by Southwestern assay. In addition, we checked the linker regions from five other KRAB ZFPs for potential DNA binding capacity. These linkers were chosen because they are basic (i.e. kid-1 (35Witzgall R. O'Leary E. Gessner R. Ouellette A.J. Bonventre J.V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1933-1942Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), rKr2 (36Pott U. Thiesen H.-J. Colello R.J. Schwab M.E. J. Neurochem. 1995; 65: 1955-1966Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), and ZFP-60 (37Perez M. Rompato G. Corbi N. De G.L. Dragani T.A. Passananti C. FEBS Lett. 1996; 387: 117-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar)) or because they contain cysteine residues (i.e. NK10 (38Lange R. Christoph A. Thiesen H.J. Vopper G. Johnson K.R. Lemaire L.

DNA Cell Biol. 1995; 14: 971-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and RNU67082) and might have the potential to form a nucleic acid binding pocket. Each of the fusion proteins was produced in comparable quantity in bacteria, and these amounts were sufficient to be detected on blots stained with Amido Black (Fig. 2 B, lower panel). However, when tested in the Southwestern assay, only hL1 bound DNA substantially (Fig. 2 B, upper panel). These data suggest that the DNA binding capacity of the mouse ZFP-37 linker region is indeed conserved in man and is unique to ZFP-37. Fusion protein binding to DNA was characterized further in bandshift assays, using probes between 30 and 250 bp. Under the conditions tested GST-3ZF and GST-8ZF did not bind DNA (data not shown). It was not possible to investigate the complete zinc finger region because GST-ZFP-37 is very difficult to elute using glutathione beads and is never eluted as a single pure species. Although we subsequently synthesized other fusion proteins that lacked the KRAB and linker regions but contained 10–12 zinc fingers, we found that these fusion proteins also are difficult to purify (data not shown). Hence the zinc finger domain was not analyzed further using the GST system. In contrast, GST-KL1, which is eluted in high yields and as a pure species, binds efficiently to all tested probes larger than 50 bp (data not shown). We next tested the influence of protein concentration on KL1-DNA complex formation using a probe of 140 bp (Fig. 3 A). This showed that between 163 and 325 nm KL1, protein-DNA interactions become stable,i.e. complexes migrate as a single species through the acrylamide gel. The increase in apparent size of protein-DNA complexes at increasing protein concentrations suggests that more than one molecule of KL1 needs to be bound per DNA molecule to get a rigid structure that can migrate stably through a gel. This in turn indicates that KL1 binds DNA cooperatively. Probes smaller than 50 bp might not be able to accommodate enough protein molecules to ensure a stable interaction with DNA. The specificity of DNA binding by the linker domain of ZFP-37 was investigated in more detail in competition bandshifts (Fig. 3 B). Increasing amounts (10-, 50-, and 200-fold excess) of unlabeled single- and double-stranded DNA or RNA competitors were added to reactions that contained an excess of KL1 fusion protein complexed to 5 ng of the 140-bp probe. In these experiments the best competitor was sheared mouse genomic DNA, which is able to abolish probe-protein interactions completely when added at a 10-fold excess (Fig. 3 B). Roughly 5-fold more of the other double-stranded nucleic acids (both DNA and RNA) is needed to compete away binding of the labeled probe to KL1, whereas single-stranded competitors and poly(dI·dC) are effective only at very high concentrations. Interestingly, the addition of denatured RNA to KL1-DNA complexes caused an apparent increase in the size of these complexes instead of a decrease (or disappearance) as in the other lanes. One explanation for this phenomenon is that this nonlabeled competitor is able to attach to the KL1-DNA complexes. The competition by RNA is not caused by contaminating DNA in the preparation because RNase-treated RNA does not compete (data not shown). Together the data indicate that the linker region of ZFP-37 has more affinity for double-stranded than for single-stranded nucleic acids, and it has a preference for DNA over RNA. To investigate whether the histone H1-like region in ZFP-37 is responsible for DNA binding, we generated fusion proteins with increasingly smaller and/or different parts of the KL1 linker domain (Fig. 4 A). All proteins were made in sufficient quantity and could be affinity purified in a single step (data not shown). These proteins (and GST-hL1 described above) were next tested for their ability to"

L-A has a 4.6-kilobase single segment genome encoding its major coat protein, Gag, and an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, Pol, synthesized as a Gag-Pol fusion protein formed by a −1 ribosomal frameshift (9Icho T.

A. 1991; 88: 174-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). This structure has proven typical of a large group of viruses of fungi, parasitic microorganisms and plants, theTotiviridae. A satellite dsRNA, M1, encodes a polypeptide killer toxin lethal to strains not carrying M1and is useful as a phenotype for following L-A functions genetically. The coding strategy of L-A suggested both a parallel with retroviruses, and a mechanism of virus assembly and packaging (9Icho T. Wickner R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6716-6723Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Fujimura T. Wickner R.B. Cell. 1988; 55: 663-671Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). It was proposed that the fusion protein was incorporated into the viral particles by the association of the Gag part of the Gag-Pol fusion protein, with free Gag molecules. Because the Pol domain of the fusion protein bound single-stranded RNA, it was suggested that this association led also to packaging of the viral (+) strands. It was shown that most of Pol was dispensable for incorporation of Gag-Pol into viral particles but that the N terminus of Pol contains the domain necessary for packaging viral RNA (12Fujimura T. Ribas J.C. Makhov A.M. Wickner R.B. Nature. 1992; 359: 746-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 13Ribas J.C. Fujimura T. Wickner R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28420-28428Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, it was impossible to test whether part or all of Gag of the Gag-Pol fusion protein was necessary for incorporation of Gag-Pol into viral particles without changing both Gag itself and the Gag part of the fusion protein. The ribosomal frameshift site that forms the Gag-Pol fusion is not at the C terminus of Gag but lies 35 amino acids upstream from that point, so that the Gag part of Gag-Pol lacks these C-terminal 35 residues present in Gag. For the same reason, the most N-terminal part of the Pol ORF is encoded by the same sequence as is the C-terminal 35 residues of Gag. Its function could also not be tested without simultaneous alterations of Gag. The Gag protein is sufficient to form viral particles (12Fujimura T. Ribas J.C. Makhov A.M. Wickner R.B. Nature. 1992; 359: 746-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), but what parts of Gag are essential has not been defined. The N termini of Gag and Gag-Pol are acetylated by Mak3p, a modification necessary for viral assembly (14Tercero J.C. Riles L.E. Wickner R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20270-20276Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Tercero J.C. Wickner R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20277-20281Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Tercero J.C. Dinman J.D. Wickner R.B. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 3192-3194Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), but whether both Gag and Gag-Pol need to be acetylated or whether myristoylation can substitute for acetylation was not known. In this work, we address the functions of Gag, the Gag part of the fusion protein, and the part of Pol that overlaps Gag by expressing Gag and Gag-Pol (and their mutants) separately and using this combination to support the M1 satellite dsRNA encoding the killer toxin.

It was made by inserting a XhoI site in pJR99 before the Pol sequence to make pJR134 and inserting a XhoI site in pJR96 after the end of Gag to make pJR135. pJR136 contained the largeHindIII-XhoI fragment of pJR134 (including vector and Pol sequences) and the HindIII-XhoI Gag fragment of pJR135. XhoI was removed, and Gag and Pol were put in frame by site-directed mutagenesis (SDM) of pJR136 to make pJR139. pJR138 contained the entire Gag sequence and the Pol sequence lacking its first 35 amino acids and was made by SDM of pJR13. pJR146 has the ADH1 promoter-X cDNA sequence-ADH1 terminator fragment from pJR58 (13Ribas J.C.

Viral particles from strains JR3 or JR13, harboring different L-A constructs, were prepared from CsCl gradients by a modification of our method (13Ribas J.C. Fujimura T. Wickner R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28420-28428Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Stationary phase cells from a 1-liter culture were suspended in 1.6 ml/g (wet weight) of 100 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.6, 20 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1.4m sorbitol, and 6 mg/ml zymolyase 20T, incubated for 55–60 min at 37 °C, and collected by centrifugation at 1500 ×g for 20 min. Cells were suspended in 30 ml of buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol) and lysed by passage through a French pressure cell. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 20 min, and a sample was taken as “cell extract” (see figures). The supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 90 min. The pellet was resuspended in buffer A, clarified, and made 1.32 g/ml with CsCl (for empty particles from strain JR13) or 1.35 (for M1 dsRNA containing particles from strain JR3) in a total volume of 13 ml. 18 fractions of 0.5–0.6 ml were collected. For sucrose gradients, CsCl gradient fractions 8–18 were pooled, diluted to 26 ml with buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 10 mmβ-mercaptoethanol), and centrifuged 90 min at 130,000 ×g. The pellet was washed in buffer A, centrifuged 45 min at 130,000 × g, and suspended in 200 μl of buffer A. Particles were centrifuged 14 h at 15,000 rpm in an SW41 rotor on 10-ml gradients of 10–40% sucrose in buffer A. 18 fractions of 0.5–0.6 ml were collected. Fractions were diluted four times in SDS loading buffer, boiled for 4 min, and 4 μl (empty particles) or 20 μl (M1 particles) were analyzed by SDS-7.5% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blotting. The upper part of the membrane was incubated with rabbit polyclonal anti-Pol and the lower part with mouse monoclonal anti-Gag antiserum as described (13Ribas J.C. Fujimura T. Wickner R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28420-28428Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Detection was by an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated second antibody (Promega). Cytoduction (transfer of cytoplasm from donor to recipient strain without changing the nuclear genotype (24Conde J. Fink G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 3651-3655Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar)) and the killer assay were done as described (13Ribas J.C. Fujimura T. Wickner R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28420-28428Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Ribas J.C. Wickner R.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2185-2189Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). M1 dsRNA was introduced from the donor strain JR5 pI2L2 K+ to the recipient strain JR8, expressing Gag and Gag-Pol (or their mutant forms). When Gag and Gag-Pol are translated from the mRNA of L-A, the fusion protein is expressed at about 2% the efficiency of Gag (10Dinman J.D. Icho T. Wickner R.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 174-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). However, expressing Gag and Gag-Pol from two independent clones (pJR96 + pM2, Fig. 1 A,sample 4), produced particles with roughly the same ratio of Gag to Gag-Pol as was produced from the intact L-A clone (pI2L2, Fig. 1 A, sample 1) or is found in the L-A virus (data not shown). As previously shown (12Fujimura T. Ribas J.C. Makhov A.M. Wickner R.B. Nature. 1992; 359: 746-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), Gag alone was able to make particles (Fig. 1 A, sample 2), but Gag-Pol did not (Fig. 1 A, sample 3). For unknown reasons, the level of Gag-Pol (and its mutants) was only 3–4-fold higher when expressed from these clones than when expressed by the −1 frameshifting mechanism (see cell extract of Fig. 1 A,samples 3 and 4, and below). The separately expressed Gag and Gag-Pol made virus particles containing the fusion protein, and these particles could stably maintain the killer toxin-encoding M1 satellite dsRNA when M1 was introduced by cytoduction (Fig. 1 C, sample 4) and showed the same profile of M1-containing particles in CsCl gradients as that from an L-A clone (Fig. 1 B). A higher Gag-Pol ratio achieved by expressing Gag-Pol alone from one plasmid and both Gag and Gag-Pol (by frameshifting) from the normal L-A clone also stably maintained M1 dsRNA (data not shown). A very low Gag-Pol:Gag ratio supplied by pJR13, mutated in the frameshift sequence, could propagate M1 dsRNA at very low copy number, with just detectable killer activity (data not shown). In strain JR3, this very weak activity was stably propagated, but it was unstable in host strain JR13. The fusion protein was undetectable on CsCl gradients of particles (data not shown). In the experiments described below, Gag (and its mutant derivatives) was provided from pJR13 derivatives that had been deleted for Pol sequences. When a fusion protein, truncated at residue 414 of the Pol domain, is expressed, even though in 3–4-fold excess, together with the full-length L-A, the former does not interfere with the ability of the latter to propagate M1 stably. The truncated Gag-Pol is nonfunctional, lacking the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase consensus regions known to be essential for propagation of M1 (25Ribas J.C. Wickner R.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2185-2189Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). We examined M1 dsRNA containing viral particles in two strains: one with a full-length L-A clone and a truncated Gag-Pol clone (Fig. 2 A) and the other with a truncated L-A clone (that makes Gag and a truncated Gag-Pol) and a full-length Gag-Pol clone (Fig. 2 B). Because of its smaller size, the truncated Gag-Pol can be distinguished on Western blots from the full-length Gag-Pol. CsCl gradients of M1-containing particles from both strains showed peaks of empty particles, light particles (one M1 dsRNA molecule per particle), and heavy particles (two M1 dsRNA molecules per particle). In both strains, the truncated Gag-Pol was incorporated into the fractions of M1 dsRNA-containing particles. Each particle with the truncated Gag-Pol that has M1 dsRNA must also have a second (functional) Gag-Pol. The only qualification of this experiment is that the deleted part of Gag-Pol could be the part that identifies the molecule as Gag-Pol to the assembling virus. However, if this were the case, higher amounts of the truncated fusion protein should be found in virions as it would be incorporated as a Gag, rather than as a Gag-Pol. In fact, the particles formed in cells with excess truncated fusion protein have no more truncated than full-length fusion protein (Fig. 2 A), whereas the cells making excess full-length fusion protein incorporate it more efficiently into particles than the truncated protein (Fig. 2 B). X dsRNA, a deletion mutant of L-A dsRNA, is propagated by L-A virus-encoded proteins and is found in particles containing from one to eight X molecules per particle (26Esteban R. Wickner R.B. J. Virol. 1988; 62: 1278-1285Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When X is supported by a full-length L-A clone and a truncated Gag-Pol, the truncated protein is found in all fractions containing virus particles but always in amounts equal to or less than the full-length fusion protein, supporting the results above (data not shown). Does L-A have cis-assembly, preferentially incorporating the Gag-Pol made on the same mRNA as that making the Gag? The truncated fusion protein expressed from the mRNA that also makes Gag is incorporated with lower efficiency than the full-length fusion protein expressed in trans (Fig. 2 B). In the opposite case, both fusion proteins are incorporated equally (Fig. 2 A). This suggests that L-A does not have a preferential mechanism of cis-assembly. A Gag-Pol with the last 35 amino acids of Gag added between the Gag and Pol sequence was incorporated into the particles (Fig. 3, A, sample 5, and C, sample 5), and these particles were able to maintain the killer dsRNA (Fig. 3 C,sample 5). Like the native Gag-Pol, this construct cannot make particles by itself (data not shown), so the failure of native Gag-Pol to form viral particles or to be incorporated in higher amount into particles is not simply due to the absence of these 35 residues present in its Gag part. This construct, like the normal Gag-Pol, was only 3–4-fold overproduced in total cell extracts (Fig. 3 A, compare samples 1 and 5). To simulate a frameshift at the end of Gag we made a Gag-Pol lacking the first 35 residues of Pol but having the entire Gag, instead of lacking 35 residues (Fig. 3 C, samples 2 and 4). Total expression and incorporation into particles (Fig. 3 A,4) was similar to normal Gag-Pol or to the full Gag-full Pol construct, but it was unable to support the killer activity (Fig. 3 C, sample 4). This result, combined with earlier data (12Fujimura T. Ribas J.C. Makhov A.M. Wickner R.B. Nature. 1992; 359: 746-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 13Ribas J.C. Fujimura T. Wickner R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28420-28428Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), shows that there is no single part of Pol that is necessary for incorporation of the fusion protein into viral particles. Further, the limited expression of Gag-Pol is due to the presence of Pol rather than to the absence of the last 35 amino acids of Gag. To test RNA packaging with these constructs, Gag was expressed from one plasmid, the different fusion proteins from a second plasmid, and the packaging substrate from a third expression plasmid that produces a transcript, detectable on Northern blots, containing the L-A packaging site (12Fujimura T. Ribas J.C. Makhov A.M. Wickner R.B. Nature. 1992; 359: 746-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Particles containing the proteins shown in Fig. 3 C, samples 4 or 5, were purified in a CsCl gradient and analyzed for their ability to package the tester transcript. Both types of viral particles packaged the RNA transcript (Fig. 3 B), indicating that the only region responsible for packaging is that previously described, from residues 67 to 213 of Pol. The absence of M1 propagation activity of the construct in Fig. 3 C, sample 4, must be due to alteration of other Pol functions such as RNA replication or transcription. L-A proteins are acetylated at their N terminus, and the absence of this modification leads to failure of particle formation (14Tercero J.C. Riles L.E. Wickner R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20270-20276Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Tercero J.C. Wickner R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20277-20281Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Tercero J.C. Dinman J.D. Wickner R.B. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 3192-3194Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). When the Gag N terminus was modified by changing MLRF to MLAF or MLEF, changes previously shown to prevent acetylation (16Tercero J.C. Dinman J.D. Wickner R.B. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 3192-3194Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), no viral proteins were detected in cell extracts or a CsCl gradient, as expected. However, when these changes were introduced into Gag-Pol and expressed with normal Gag, viral proteins including the fusion protein were made and assembled into particles detected on CsCl or sucrose gradients; these particles were able to stably maintain M1 dsRNA (data not shown). Other viruses, such as hepatitis B virus (27Persing D.H. Varmus H.E. Ganem D. J. Virol. 1987; 61: 1672-1677Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or HIV (28Veronese F.D.M. Copeland T.D. Oroszlan S. Gallo R.C. Sarngadharan M.G. J. Virol. 1988; 62: 795-801Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), myristoylate their N terminus rather than acetylating it. When L-A Gag's N terminus was modified to that of cAMP-dependent protein kinase, or of HIV Gag, each of which are recognized and modified by the yeastN-myristoyl-transferase (20Towler D.A. Adams S.P. Eubanks S.R. Towery D.S. Jackson-Machelski E. Glaser L. Gordon J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1784-1790Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), no viral proteins could be detected in cell extracts or CsCl or sucrose gradients. With the same Gag-Pol modifications, leaving Gag normal, the proteins were detected in cell extracts and particles were made, but Gag-Pol was barely detectable in sucrose gradients, and these particles were unable to propagate the M1 dsRNA (data not shown). This means that the Gag modifications have different effects on Gag and Gag-Pol. Failure to acetylate Gag results in absence of accumulation of viral proteins, probably due to failure of assembly and consequent instability of viral proteins, but acetylation of Gag-Pol is dispensable. In contrast, changing either Gag or Gag-Pol to a substrate for myristoylation disrupts their function. However, even in the case of myristoylation, Gag-Pol is less affected than Gag, as the former is not degraded and is partially incorporated into particles. To examine the importance of the N-proximal part of Gag for function, deletions were made, leaving the 8 N-terminal residues unchanged to maintain acetylation (see Ref. 16Tercero J.C. Dinman J.D. Wickner R.B. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 3192-3194Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Deletion in Gag of amino acids 9–13 did not affect its ability to form particles or to propagate M1 (Fig. 4 C, sample 1), although its amount in total cell extracts decreased slightly (Fig. 4 A, sample 1). Further deletion of residues 9–18 abolished the ability to make particles or to propagate the killer (Fig. 4 A, sample 2), and the protein was barely detectable in total cell extracts, suggesting that its failure to form particles made it unstable (Fig. 4 A, sample 2). The Gag-Pol requirements were slightly more permissive. Again, deletion of residues 9–13 did not affect either incorporation into particles or killer maintenance (Fig. 4, B, sample 3, and C, sample 3). Deletion of residues 9–18 had no effect on total amount of Gag-Pol in extracts, but incorporation into particles was barely detectable, and the particles did not maintain M1 dsRNA (Fig. 4, B, sample 4, and C, sample 4). A longer deletion, of residues 9–118, completely prevented incorporation of Gag-Pol into particles, although its total amount in cell extracts was unchanged (Fig. 4, B, sample 5, and C, sample 5). Gag-Pol lacks the last 35 residues of Gag without affecting its ability to be incorporated into particles. To determine if these residues play a specific role for Gag in assembly and viral activity, a series of deletions was made supplying Gag-Pol from a separate plasmid. The last 10 amino acids were dispensable for Gag (Fig. 5 C, samples 1–3), but deletion of 15 residues made the protein unable to support M1 propagation (Fig. 5 C, sample 4), although viral particles were still made. Gag with 33 residues deleted remained able to make particles incorporating the fusion protein (Fig. 5 A, sample 6), but deletion of two more amino acids from Gag (to residue 645) resulted in failure to make particles (Fig. 5 A, sample 7), although this is the normal composition of the Gag part of Gag-Pol, which is incorporated into the particles. This and further deletions appeared spread over the light half of the CsCl gradient with amount of protein decreasing with increasing deletion. This decrease of Gag was also detected in total cell extracts, suggesting that failure of assembly leads to destabilization of Gag and degradation (Fig. 5 A). Using a strain harboring M1 dsRNA supported by the full-length L-A cDNA clone, the same series of Gag C-terminal deletions were introduced, and interference with normal Gag was tested by checking the ability to maintain the killer activity. We found low level interference in deletions that make particles but do not maintain the killer. This interference increased, peaking in a deletion of 45 amino acids (Fig. 5 C, samples 1–10), but a further deletion to 52 residues abolished interference (Fig. 5 C, sample 11). Thus, the ability of Gag to interact with other Gag molecules extends beyond its ability to make particles. Yao and Bruenn (37Yao W. Bruenn J.A. Virology. 1995; 214: 215-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), measuring loss of L-A and M1 dsRNAs, found that even production of Gag1–476 was sufficient to show interference. The difference in assay methods and possible differences in the amounts of proteins produced may explain this apparent discrepancy. N-terminal substitutions and deletions were also tested for interference, but none affected M1propagation. When C-terminal deletions of the Gag region of Gag-Pol were analyzed, it was found that a 2-residue deletion (644–645, Fig. 5 C,sample 12) had no effect. A five-amino acid deletion reduced the fusion protein's activity, making cells gradually lose the killer dsRNA, although this fusion protein was efficiently incorporated into particles (Fig. 5, B, sample 13, and C, sample 13). Longer deletions did not maintain the killer at all, and the incorporation of the mutant fusion proteins gradually decreased until a deletion of 210 residues was not detectable at all in particles (Fig. 5, B, sample 16, C, sample 16). In contrast to the results with Gag deletions, neither C-terminal nor N-terminal deletions of Gag-Pol showed any interference with normal virus made from the L-A cDNA clone (Fig. 5 C, samples 12–16, and data not shown). In no case is there more fusion protein incorporated in the particles than is found from the normal construct in which fusion protein is made by ribosomal frameshifting. Comparing normal M1-containing particles that must have the correct amount of fusion protein with M1-containing or empty particles made with plasmids overproducing Gag-Pol or its derivatives, the ratio of Gag-Pol to Gag varies from the normal ratio down to one-eighth the normal amount. Mutants of Gag that did not form particles showed decreased accumulation in total cell extracts, but in no case did a mutant in the Gag part of Gag-Pol show decreased stability or amount in total cell extracts. Like the Totiviruses, of which L-A is the type species, many retroviruses synthesize their reverse transcriptase (Pol) as a Gag-Pol fusion protein, often using a ribosomal frameshift to fuse the reading frames in a minority of the protein molecules. Expressing Gag and Gag-Pol from separate plasmids produces functional viral particles and allows independent control of their structure and the amounts produced. Although we were able to produce three to four times more than the normal proportion of fusion protein relative to Gag, we never observed more than the normal proportion of fusion protein in the particles. This amount has been roughly estimated based on the normal efficiency of ribosomal frameshifting (1.8%, Ref. 10Dinman J.D. Icho T. Wickner R.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 174-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar) and on Coomassie Blue staining to be about 2 molecules per particle. Because of evidence that L-A could only tolerate a 2-fold change in the Gag:Gag-Pol ratio (29Dinman J.D. Wickner R.B. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 3669-3676Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,30Dinman J.D. Ruiz-Echevarria M.J. Czaplinski K. Peltz S.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6606-6611Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), we were surprised that this apparent overproduction of Gag-Pol relative to Gag did not adversely affect viral propagation. The earlier studies involved altering the ratio of proteins produced from a single mRNA (viral or plasmid), whereas our experiments involved proteins made from two different mRNAs. We show that there is no cis-assembly, that is, no preference for the Gag and Gag-Pol molecule to originate from the same mRNA. Previous work has suggested that there iscis-packaging, the preferential binding (packaging) by Gag-Pol of the mRNA from which it was translated (22Valle R.P.C. Wickner R.B. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 2764-2771Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Esteban R. Wickner R.B. J. Virol. 1988; 62: 1278-1285Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Dinman J.D. Wickner R.B. Genetics. 1994; 136: 75-86Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), although direct evidence on this point is not yet available. We show here that there are at least two fusion protein molecules per particle. What limits the amount of Gag-Pol to about 2 molecules per particle? What tells the assembling virus not to regard a particular molecule as a Gag monomer but to treat it as a Gag-Pol fusion protein? There is no unique part of Pol whose deletion results in increased incorporation of fusion protein (deletions of residues 9–204, 205–413, 415–860 of Pol behave the same as intact Pol). 2J. Carlos Ribas and R. B. Wickner, unpublished results. The Gag part of Gag-Pol lacks 35 residues present in Gag, but we show here that this is not what limits the amount of Gag-Pol in viral particles. Perhaps it is simply the presence of any sizable sequence attached to the Gag C terminus that limits incorporation. Alternatively, it is possible that there is a specific association of Pol domains, that Gag-Pol dimerization is rate-limiting, and dimers of Gag-Pol prime particle formation. This Gag-Pol dimer primed capsid assembly may thus kinetically exclude more fusion protein molecules. Once a Gag-Pol dimer is formed, it rapidly becomes a complete particle. Because Gag is sufficient to make viral particles, Gag-Pol is not necessary, but it may speed the initiation of particle formation. It will be of interest to determine whether the two fusion protein molecules in each particle are in fact part of the same dimer in the structure of the shell (4Caston J.R. Trus B.L. Booy F.P. Wickner R.B. Wall J.S. Steven A.C. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 975-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), as is the case in retroviruses (32Kohlstaedt L.A. Wang J. Friedman J.M. Rice P.A. Steitz T.A. Science. 1992; 256: 1783-1790Crossref PubMed Scopus (1763) Google Scholar). The deletions of the Gag part of Gag-Pol confirm the hypothesis (11Fujimura T. Wickner R.B. Cell. 1988; 55: 663-671Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) that the Gag region is directing its incorporation into particles. However, the Gag requirements of Gag-Pol to interact with Gag proteins are less stringent than those of Gag itself. The integrity of the particle structure is determined by Gag, whereas the Gag part of Gag-Pol need only associate with other Gag molecules to be incorporated. Similar results have been obtained for incorporation of HIV Gag-Pol into particles composed mainly of HIV Gag (33Srinivasakumar N. Hammarskjold M.-L. Rekosh D. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 6106-6114Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). N-Acetylation of Gag, but not of Gag-Pol, is necessary for particle assembly, a result in perfect parallel with that found for HIV (34Park J. Morrow C.D. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 6304-6313Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Smith A.J. Srinivasakumar N. Hammarskjold M.-L. Rekosh D. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 2266-2275Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Rous sarcoma virus cores assemble without myristoylation of Gag but do not properly localize to the membrane. Myristoylation does not substitute for acetylation in L-A assembly. Even Gag-Pol, whose acetylation is dispensable, is nonfunctional if myristoylated. Understanding the precise role of acetylation will require more detailed knowledge of L-A structure. We expect that a detailed molecular dissection of L-A viral proteins, combined with structural studies, will provide a deeper understanding of the mechanisms of its assembly and replication."

However, there is only circumstantial evidence for such a two-step reaction pathway. Here we directly observe the sequential appearance of two complexes by measuring the time-dependent change in fluorescence resonance energy transfer between fluorescein-elastase and rhodamine-α1-protease inhibitor. A moderately tight initial Michaelis-type complex EI1(Ki = 0.38–0.52 μm) forms and dissociates rapidly (k1 = 1.5 × 106m−1 s−1,k−1 = 0.58 s−1).EI1 then slowly converts into EI2 (k2 = 0.13 s−1), the fluorescence intensity of which is stable for at least 50 s. The two species differ by their donor-acceptor energy transfer efficiency (0.41 and 0.26, respectively).EI2 might be the final product of the elastase + inhibitor association because its transfer efficiency is the same as that of a complex incubated for 30 min. The timedependent change in fluorescence resonance energy transfer between fluorescein-elastase and rhodamine-eglin c, a canonical inhibitor, again allows the fast formation of a complex to be observed. However, this complex does not undergo any fluorescently detectable transformation.

However, this complex does not undergo any fluorescently detectable transformation. Proteolysis, a biologically important event, is regulated by protein proteinase inhibitors that belong to two major classes: the so-called “canonical” inhibitors and the serine proteinase inhibitors, called “serpins.” The former are relatively small proteins (29–190 amino acid residues) that belong to numerous structural families (1Bode W. Huber R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 204: 433-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (1001) Google Scholar). The latter are larger proteins (400–450 residues) that form a single family with highly conserved secondary structural elements (nine α-helices and three β-sheets) (2Huber R. Carrell R. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8951-8966Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar, 3Potempa J. Korzus E. Travis J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15957-15960Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Canonical inhibitors form tight reversible complexes with their cognate enzymes. X-ray crystallography shows that they have an exposed peptidic sequence, the reactive site loop, that forms a “lock and key” complex with the substrate-binding crevice of the proteinase. This Michaelian-like complex is stabilized by a large number of noncovalent bonds which account for the high enzyme-inhibitor binding energy. Its hydrolysis is probably prevented by a small distortion of the P1-P1′ linkage of the inhibitor (1Bode W. Huber R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 204: 433-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (1001) Google Scholar). Unlike canonical inhibitors, serpins form denaturant-stable complexes with their target proteinases and behave kinetically like irreversible inhibitors (3Potempa J. Korzus E. Travis J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15957-15960Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Beatty K. Bieth J.G. Travis J. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 3931-3934Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Their mechanism of action is not well understood mainly because the tertiary structure of their complexes with proteinases has not yet been solved. A significant number of x-ray structures of active and inactive serpins are, however, available (5Loebermann H. Tokuoka R. Deisenhofer J. Huber R. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 177: 531-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar, 6Wright H. Qian H. Huber R. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 213: 513-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 7Stein P. Leslie A.W.

These structures reveal that the reactive site loop of serpins is much longer and much more flexible than that of canonical inhibitors. It may easily insert into β-sheet A to form the central strand of this unusually malleable (12Banzon J.A. Kelly J.W. Protein Eng. 1992; 5: 113-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) sheet. Full insertion of the P1 to P14 sequence of the reactive site loop may occur spontaneously (9Mottonen J. Strand A. Symersky J. Sweet R.M. Danley D.E. Geoghegan K.F. Gerard R.D. Goldsmith E.J. Nature. 1992; 355: 270-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar) or following cleavage of the P1-P1′ bond (5Loebermann H. Tokuoka R. Deisenhofer J. Huber R. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 177: 531-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar). Serpins that have undergone such a β-sheet rearrangement are inactive. On the other hand, introduction into β-sheet A of a tetradecapeptide structurally related to P1-P14 inactivates serpins because it renders them unable to insert their own P1-P14 sequence (13Schulze A.J. Baumann U. Knof S. Jaeger E. Huber R. Laurell C.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 194: 51-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Thus, full loop-sheet insertion and lack of insertion both yield inactive serpins. This led to the suggestion that loop-sheet insertion modulates the inhibitory activity of serpins (14Carrell R.W. Evans D. Stein P. Nature. 1991; 353: 576-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar) and to the proposal of a number of models for the serpin-proteinase interaction (15Wright H.T. Scarsdale J.D. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1995; 22: 210-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 16Whisstock J. Lesk A.M. Carrell R. Proteins Struct. Funct.

Biol. 1997; 118: 236-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). All these models assume that the inhibition reaction takes place in at least two steps: an initial binding followed by a structural rearrangement that stabilizes the complex. However, these steps have not been observed directly and it is not known at which rate the proteinase moves from its initial to its final position. Just as chemical kinetics helps elucidating reaction mechanisms (19Eigen M. Hammes G.G. Adv. Enzymol. 1963; 25: 1-38PubMed Google Scholar), inhibition kinetics affords insight into inhibition mechanisms. For instance, several years before publication of the first three-dimensional structure of a canonical inhibitor-proteinase complex, an inhibition mechanism for a canonical inhibitor has been proposed on the basis of a kinetic analysis (20Finkenstadt W.R. Laskowski Jr., R. J. Biol. Chem. 1965; 240: 962-963Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Most kinetic studies on serpins have reported measurements of kass, the second-order inhibition rate constant, which is useful for delineating inhibitor efficiency and physiological function (21Bieth J.G. Biochem. Med. 1984; 32: 387-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) but of poor mechanistic significance because it is a combination of rate constants for the individual reaction steps (22Bieth J.G. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 248: 59-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). On the other hand, two-step serpin-proteinase interactions I+E⇌k−1k1EI1→k2EI2Interaction 1 have been demonstrated by a limited number of investigators. The measurements were based on competition experiments in which the serpins displaced a substrate or another ligand from the active center of the proteinase (23Olson S. Shore J. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 14891-14895Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Stone S.R. Nick H. Hofsteenge J. Monard D. Arch. Biochem.

Bieth J.G. Biochem. J. 1989; 259: 929-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The time course of the reaction was thus followed indirectly. In addition, these experimental approaches did not provide access to k−1 and k1 but only to Ki, the ratio of these two constants. We hypothesized that labeling of one reaction partner with a fluorescence donor and of the other with a fluorescence acceptor and measuring the time dependence of the fluorescence resonance energy transfer with a fast kinetic apparatus would allow us to directly observe the individual reaction species as well as the dynamics of their interconversion. The present work checks this hypothesis by investigating the interaction of elastase with α1PI, a serpin, and comparing it with binding of elastase with eglin c, a canonical inhibitor. Porcine pancreatic elastase (elastase) 1The abbreviations used are: elastase, porcine pancreatic elastase (unless another type of elastase is specifically mentioned); α1PI, α1-proteinase inhibitor (α1-antitrypsin); FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; TMR, tetramethylrhodamine; TES,N-tris(hydroxymethyl)methyl-2-aminoethanesulfonic acid. was isolated and active site titrated as described previously (27Boudier C. Bieth J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4370-4375Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant α1PI and eglin c expressed in Escherichia coliwere obtained from Novartis (Basel) and were titrated with human neutrophil elastase (27Boudier C. Bieth J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4370-4375Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Faller B. Dirrig S. Rabaud M. Bieth J.G. Biochem. J. 1990; 270: 639-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). α1PI was specifically labeled on Cys-232, its single free cysteinyl residue using tetramethylrhodamine-5-maleimide (Molecular Probes). A 140 μm solution of α1PI was made up in 50 mm TES, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.0, and reacted with a 1.5 molar excess of the labeling reagent dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide. After 1 h at room temperature, excess reagent was removed by two gel filtrations on a PD-10 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with 50 mm Hepes, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4. Active site titration with human neutrophil elastase showed that α1PI was fully active after labeling. Yields varied from 0.7 to 0.9 label/molecule of α1PI as determined spectrophotometrically using ε555 nm = 75,000 m−1cm−1 for protein-bound label. Prior reaction of α1PI with 4-N,N-dimethylaminoazobenzene-4′-iodoacetamido-2′-sulfonic acid (Protein Institute, Philadelphia, PA), a specific reagent of free thiols (29Sun X. Chang J. Eur. J. Biol. 1989; 185: 225-230Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar), yielded a protein that did not further bind tetramethylrhodamine-5-maleimide, indicating that the latter specifically labels Cys-232. Eglin c (1.2 mm) was dissolved in the above TES buffer and reacted with a 3-fold molar excess of the succinimidyl derivative of tetramethylrhodamine dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide. After 1 h at room temperature, excess reagent was removed as described above. Active site titration with human neutrophil elastase showed that the labeled inhibitor retained full activity. There was 0.96 molecule of label/molecule of eglin c as determined spectrophotometrically using the above ε555 nm. Elastase (0.8 mm) was dissolved in 0.1 mcarbonate buffer, pH 9.0, and reacted with a 20-fold molar excess of FITC (Molecular Probes) dissolved in methanol. After 1 h at room temperature, excess reagent was removed by gel filtration on two PD-10 columns equilibrated and developed successively with the above carbonate buffer and with 1 mm HCl. Active site titration of FITC·elastase with nonlabeled α1PI showed that the enzyme did not loose activity during labeling. There was 1.1 label/molecule of elastase as determined spectrophotometrically using ε495 nm = 66,800 m−1cm−1 for protein-bound FITC (30Mercola D.A. Morris J.W.S. Arquilla E.R. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 3860-3874Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). A higher degree of labeling could not be achieved. Absorption and emission spectra were recorded on a Cary 4 spectrophotometer and a SLM-8000 spectrofluorometer, respectively. Fluorescence quantum yields of free and α1PI-bound FITC elastase were measured using acryflavin as a reference (φ = 0.45). Emission spectra were corrected for screening effects at both excitation and emission wavelengths (31Pigault C. Gérard D. Photochem. Photobiol. 1984; 40: 291-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Kinetics of interaction of FITC·elastase with TMR·α1PI or TMR·eglin c was monitored by fluorescence resonance energy transfer from FITC to TMR using a Bio-Logic SFM-3 stopped flow apparatus with a dead time of 1.7 ms (Bio-Logic, Claix, France). The reaction was done in 100 mm Hepes, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4, 25 °C. The excitation and emission wavelengths were 450 and 514 nm (Melles-Griot interferential filter), respectively. Fig. 1shows the fluorescence spectra of the free and bound species. It can be seen that reaction of FITC·elastase with TMR·α1PI significantly quenches the emission of FITC and enhances that of TMR, strongly suggesting fluorescence resonance energy transfer between the donor and the acceptor. To see whether part of the fluorescence intensity variation is due to a change in the environment of the label(s) following complex formation, we have recorded the spectrum of the complex formed of FITC·elastase and unlabeled α1PI as well as that formed of TMR·α1PI and unlabeled elastase (Fig. 1). In both curves, the binding of the unlabeled protein only marginally affected the fluorescence of the labeled one. This clearly indicates that all of the fluorescence intensity variation is associated with a nonradiative energy transfer process between FITC and TMR. Fig. 2shows a typical biphasic stopped flow trace observed upon mixing FITC·elastase with a 10-fold molar excess of TMR·α1PI. The fluorescence intensity rapidly decreases (t½ ≈ 60 ms), falls to a minimum and then slowly recovers (t½ ≈ 5 s) without reaching its initial value. We have tentatively assumed that the initial fluorescence quenching describes the formation of an initial complexEI1, which slowly converts into a second complexEI2 (Fig. 2). The fluorescence intensity was stable for at least 50 s (i.e. 10t½ of EI2 formation) whether the reaction was run under pseudo-first-order conditions ([I]o = 10 [E]o = 7 μm) or under second-order-conditions ([E]o = [I]o= 7 μm). This indicates that within this interval of time, EI2 neither releases free FITC·elastase, which would enhance the fluorescence intensity, nor converts into a further complex with a different donor-acceptor transfer efficiency. The fluorescence intensity could not be recorded beyond 50 s because of photodecomposition of the label(s). A control where FITC·elastase was mixed with unlabeled α1PI showed a fluorescence decay of about 4% over the observation time of 50 s. This small decrease was considered to be negligible and was not taken into account for further calculations. Data analysis showed that the formation of the two complexes could be described by simple exponentials: the pseudo-first-order rate constant of EI1 formation (kobs) was 11.8 ± 0.6 s−1 for [I]o = 10 [E]o = 7 μm, whereas the first-order rate constant for the conversion of E11 into EI2 (k2) was 0.130 ± 0.004 s−1. To see whether the EI1 complex is reversible or irreversible, we have recorded stopped flow traces using constant concentrations of FITC·elastase and variable concentrations of TMR·α1PI. We have found that the minimum fluorescence intensity (Fig. 2), a measure of the concentration ofEI1, varies hyperbolically with the inhibitor concentration (Fig. 3). This rules out irreversible binding because reaction of constant concentrations of enzyme with increasing concentrations of inhibitor should lead to constant concentrations of complex if binding were irreversible. The data of Fig. 3 were thus analyzed assuming that FITC·elastase (E) and TMR·α1PI (I) form a reversible complexEI1 whose equilibrium dissociation constantKi may be calculated by fitting the fluorescence data to Equation 1. ΔFΔFmax=[(E)o+(I)o+Ki]−[(E)o+(I)o+Ki]2−4(E)o(I)o2(E)oEquation 1 where ΔF is the difference between the minimum fluorescence intensity of EI1 and the fluorescence intensity at t = 0 while ΔFmax is the asymptotic value of ΔF for infinite concentrations of inhibitor. Nonlinear regression analysis yielded Ki = 0.52 ± 0.08 μm. The curve calculated using this value fairly well fits the experimental points (Fig. 3). The above equilibrium may also be described by the rate constant of complex formation and dissociation by the following interaction. E+I⇌k−1k1EI1Interaction 2 which may also be written as E⇌k−1k1[I]oEI1Interaction 3 if pseudo-first-order conditions prevail. Hence,kobs, the pseudo-first-order rate constant for the EI1 formation is given by kobs=k1[I]o+k−1Equation 2 To determine k1 and k−1 we have measuredkobs under pseudo-first-order conditions. Fig. 4 shows that kobsis linearly related to [I]o as predicted by Equation 2. The individual rate constants were calculated by linear regression analysis k1 = (1.5 ± 0.02) × 106m−1 s−1,k−1 = 0.58 ± 0.08 s−1. The equilibrium dissociation constant K1 of theEI1 complex, calculated fromk1 and k−1 was 0.38 ± 0.06 μm. This value is in good agreement with that measured under equilibrium conditions and therefore provides good internal consistency to our data. On the other hand, the fluorescence intensity corresponding to EI2 did not change with the inhibitor concentration. In addition, k2, the first-order rate constant for the conversion of EI1 into EI2 was also inhibitor-independent (data not shown). These two observations are interpreted to mean thatk2 is a true first-order rate constant,i.e. that the transformation of EI1into EI2 is an irreversible process. Our data therefore provide a complete kinetic description of the minimum steps of the interaction of elastase with α1PI: E+I⇌0.58s−11.5×106M−1s−1EI1→0.13s−1EI2Interaction 4 The transfer efficiency, ED, within the complex prepared by manually mixing labeled elastase with labeled α1PI (see legend to Fig. 1) was derived from steady-state fluorescence measurements and calculated as follows: ED=1−ΦD,A/ΦDEquation 3 where φD,A and φD are the quantum yields of the FITC·elastase-TMR·α1PI complex and the FITC·elastase-α1PI complex, respectively. φD,A was corrected to take into account the degree of labeling, f, of α1PI by TMR. ΦD,A(corrected)=ΦD,A(measured−(1−f)ΦD)fEquation 4 Following corrections for screening effects,ED was found to be 0.26 ± 0.02. The transfer efficiencies, ED, within theEI1 and EI2 complexes detected by stopped flow (Fig. 2) were also calculated from the fluorescence intensities at 515 nm, a wavelength at which FITC is the only fluorescent chromophore: ED=1−ID,A/IDEquation 5 where ID,A and IDare the fluorescence intensities of the FITC·elastase-TMR·α1PI complex and the FITC·elastase-α1PI complex, respectively.ID,A was again corrected for the degree of labeling. The screening effect was negligible in the stopped flow experiments. For the EI2 complex,ED was 0.26 ± 0.03, a value identical to that corresponding to the elastase-α1PI complex prepared by manual mixing. The value of ID,A used to calculateED for the EI1 complex was taken from the minimum fluorescence intensity (Fig. 2) of stopped flow mixtures containing 0.35 μm FITC·elastase and 11.4 μm TMR·α1PI, which yield 97%EI1 complex, i.e. in which the fluorescence contribution of free FITC·elastase is negligible. After correcting for the degree of labeling, ED was found to be 0.41 ± 0.04. Possible random labeling of the lysine residues of elastase precluded interchromophore distance calculations using the ED values. Eglin c is a reversible proteinase inhibitor that belongs to the class of canonical inhibitors (1Bode W. Huber R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 204: 433-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (1001) Google Scholar). Mixing FITC·elastase with a 10-fold molar excess of TMR·eglin c yields an exponential fluorescence quenching whose amplitude does not change during the 50-s observation time (Fig. 5). This behavior sharply contrasts with that of α1PI (Fig. 2). The reversible binding of elastase with eglin c (22Bieth J.G. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 248: 59-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) therefore takes place in only one fluorescently detectable step. We have measured the rate constant kobs of fluorescence energy transfer as a function of inhibitor concentration under pseudo-first-order conditions ([I]o = 10 [E]o). Fig. 6 shows that kobsincreases linearly with the inhibitor concentration as already observed with α1PI and described by Equation 2. The association rate constant k1 calculated from this plot was found to be 1.8 × 106m−1s−1, in good agreement with the value of 106m−1 s−1, measured by enzymatic means (22Bieth J.G. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 248: 59-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). The k−1 value could not be determined accurately because the eglin c concentrations used in these experiments were at least 86-fold higher than the Ki of the elastase-eglin c complex (Ki = 10−8m; Ref. 22Bieth J.G. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 248: 59-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) so thatk1 [I]o ≫k-1 and kobs ≈k1 [I]o in Equation 2.Figure 6Effect of TMR·eglin c concentration on the apparent first-order rate constant for the formation of the FITC·elastase-TMR·eglin c complex at pH 7.4 and 25 °C.

It is commonly assumed but rarely demonstrated that the first step of the reaction of a proteinase with a serpin is the formation of a reversible Michaelis-type complex involving the substrate-binding site of the enzyme and the reactive site loop of the inhibitor. Serpin-induced displacement of ligands from the active center of proteinases (23Olson S. Shore J. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 14891-14895Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Stone S.R.

Acta. 1982; 704: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 33Shieh B. Potempa J. Travis J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13420-13423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have provided indirect evidence for such a reversible binding step. In the present work an initial complex referred to as EI1 forms in less than 1 s after mixing. Rate and equilibrium measurements of the building up of this species clearly demonstrate that it is a fast equilibrating reversible complex. We believe this is the first direct evidence for a Michaelis-type complex between a proteinase and a serpin. On the other hand, the conversion of EI1into EI2 is a true first-order process because its rate and amplitude do not depend upon the inhibitor concentration. This indicates that the formation of EI2 and hence the overall elastase-α1PI interaction is an irreversible process, a view supported by enzymatic data showing that α1PI and other serpins behave like irreversible proteinase inhibitors (4Beatty K. Bieth J.G. Travis J. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 3931-3934Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The two-step model presented here is probably a minimal one because fluorescence detects only those species that significantly differ in energy transfer efficiency, whereas it is not unlikely that undetectable reaction intermediates also appear during the elastase + α1PI reaction. Molecular modeling studies (15Wright H.T. Scarsdale J.D. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1995; 22: 210-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 16Whisstock J. Lesk A.M. Carrell R.

A. 1997; 94: 453-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) indicate that in the course of its reaction with a serpin, the proteinase moves more or less far away from its initial position, whereas the serpin's reactive site loop inserts more or less deeply into β-sheet A. It has also been demonstrated that proteinases cleave the P1-P′1 bond of serpins and form acyl-enzyme intermediates between the serine residue of their catalytic site and the P1 residue of the inhibitors. This cleavage is believed to trigger the above conformational changes and, as a consequence, to stabilize the final complex by preventing the hydrolysis of the acyl-enzyme (35Lawrence D.A. Ginsburg D. Day D.E. Berkenpass M.B. Verhammes I.M. Kvassman J.O. Shore J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25309-25312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 36Wilczynska M.

These findings may help discuss the nature of theEI2 complex and the significance ofk2, the rate constant of its formation. The stopped flow detected complex is probably structurally identical to the stable complex prepared by manual mixing and incubated for 30 min because the two species have identical donor-acceptor transfer efficiencies. As a consequence, EI2 is likely to be identical with the elastase-α1PI complex, which Lawrence et al. (35Lawrence D.A. Ginsburg D. Day D.E. Berkenpass M.B. Verhammes I.M. Kvassman J.O. Shore J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25309-25312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar) and Wilczynska et al. (36Wilczynska M. Fa M. Ohlsson P.-I. Ny T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29652-29655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) have shown to be a translocated acyl-enzyme. Althoughk2 describes the first-order fluorescence increase that accompanies the conversion of EI1into EI2, it is not necessarily the rate constant for the translocation of elastase. The enzyme's acylation and translocation are separate events characterized by two individual rate constants, kacylation and ktranslocation. Because theEI1 to EI2 conversion is a simple exponential process, k2 might have either one of the following two meanings: (i) k2≈ kacylation, i.e. kacylation ≪ ktranslocationor (ii) k2 ≈ktranslocation, i.e. kacylation ≫ktranslocation. The second assumption implies that the acyl-enzyme would be exposed to water during the long lasting translocation process (t½ = 5.3 s). Because enzyme translocation is required to prevent hydrolysis of the acyl-enzyme, active enzyme would be released during the translocation process. This is not the case because the 1:1 elastase·α1PI complex is enzymatically inactive (4Beatty K. Bieth J.G. Travis J. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 3931-3934Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We may, therefore, tentatively conclude that k2 is the rate constant for the acylation of elastase. We are not unaware that the above reasoning is somewhat speculative. For instance, despite its having an energy transfer efficiency identical to that of the stable complex prepared by manual mixing, EI2might not be the final inhibitory complex because it might still undergo fluorescently silent structural changes. On the other hand, the acylation and the translocation rates might not be as different from each other as we have hypothesized. Clearly, the only way to solve these uncertainties would be to directly measure the rate of acylation. Like the serpin α1PI, the canonical inhibitor eglin c (1Bode W. Huber R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 204: 433-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (1001) Google Scholar) rapidly forms a Michaelis-type complex with elastase, but this complex does not undergo the characteristic conversion seen with the elastase-α1PI complex. This is in accord with crystallographic data showing that the P1-P′1bond of eglin c is not cleaved within the enzyme-inhibitor complex (37Bode W. Papamokos E. Musil D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 166: 673-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar) and that there are no gross structural differences between free and proteinase-bound eglin c (38Hipler K. Priestle J. Rahuel J. Grutter M. FEBS Lett. 1992; 309: 139-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Thus, kinetics of fluorescence resonance energy transfer unambiguously discriminates the serpin α1PI from the canonical inhibitor eglin c. Most extracellular serpins play a proteolysis-preventing function. The data collected using our new approach may help to better delineate this function. In vivo, a proteinase is usually released into a milieu containing both serpin and substrate. Knowledge ofKi and [I]o, the in vivoinhibitor concentration, will allow prediction of whether the substrate may effectively compete with the serpin for the binding of the proteinase; competition is possible if [I]o/Ki ≈ [S]o/Km. Besides, the magnitude ofk−1 will predict the rate at which a preformedEI1 complex may be dissociated by substrate. Last, the magnitude of k2 will predict the apparent reversible or irreversible nature of the inhibition in vivo. If k2 is fast, for example sayk2 > 10−2 s−1(t½ < 1 min), the inhibition will be irreversible within a few minutes. However, if k2 < 10−2 s−1, the inhibition may be reversible for a prolonged time, a view that is generally overlooked.

Myosin is a family of mechanochemical proteins that contain a conserved ∼80-kDa motor domain which can bind to actin, hydrolyze ATP, and translocate along actin filaments (1Mooseker M.S. Cheney R.E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 633-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 2Sellers J.R. Goodson H.V. Protein Profile. 1995; 2: 1323-1423PubMed Google Scholar). The myosin family now consists of 14 classes. Conventional myosin (myosin II in the new classification) consists of a pair of heavy chains (∼200 kDa) and two pairs of light chains (15–20 kDa) and can form filaments through an α-helical coiled coil rod-like region. While nonmuscle myosin II is present in all eukaryotic cells, in higher organisms, different types of cells contain different isoforms of myosin II. In vertebrates, there are over 10 different isoforms of myosin II that are divided into two subgroups, i.e. sarcomeric (skeletal and cardiac muscles) and nonsarcomeric (smooth muscle and nonmuscle) myosin IIs. The contractile property of sarcomeric and smooth muscle myosin IIs is their prominent feature and they serve as an integral part of the contractile apparatus in muscle cells. On the other hand, the exact function of nonmuscle myosin II is still under study, but numerous biochemical and cell biological studies, as well as genetic studies using Dictyostelium, have demonstrated that myosin IIs in nonmuscle cells are involved in diverse cellular motile processes including cytokinesis, capping of surface receptors, and cell shape changes (see Ref. 3Spudich J.A. Cell Regul. 1989; 1: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar for review). Recent genetic studies usingDrosophila and mouse systems have also demonstrated that nonmuscle myosin II plays a critical role in embryonic morphogenesis and development (4Young P.E. Richman A.M.

There are at least 8 genes for sarcomeric MHCs in vertebrates and expression of these genes is regulated developmentally, hormonally, and in a muscle fiber type-specific manner. This regulation occurs mainly at a transcriptional level and a number of muscle-specific enhancers and transcriptional factors have been identified (6Weintraub H.

Chem. 1992; 267: 17864-17871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Kawamoto S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17613-17616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Human nonmuscle MHC-A and -B genes are located on chromosomes 22q11.2 and 17p13, respectively (12Saez C.G. Myers J.C. Shows T.B. Leinwand L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Blood. 1991; 78: 1826-1833Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The two nonmuscle MHC mRNAs are expressed in a variety of tissues, but the relative amounts of the two mRNAs vary among different tissues (10Katsuragawa Y. Yanagisawa M. Inoue A. Masaki T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 184: 611-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 17Kawamoto S. Adelstein R.S. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 915-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). MHC-A is the dominant isoform in intestinal epithelium, spleen, and thymus, whereas MHC-B is dominant in brain and testis. Lung and kidney contain approximately equal amounts of each MHC mRNA. In contrast, both nonmuscle MHC-A and -B mRNAs are barely detectable in fully developed skeletal muscles where the sarcomeric MHC is dominant. Serum and other mitotic stimulants change the expression of these genes differently (14Toothaker L.E. Gonzalez D.A. Tung N. Lemons R.S. Le Beau M.M. Arnaout M.A. Clayton L.K. Tenen D.G. Blood. 1991; 78: 1826-1833Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Kawamoto S. Adelstein R.S. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 915-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). For example, serum stimulation up-regulates MHC-A gene expression, whereas it down-regulates MHC-B gene expression in fibroblasts. Accumulating evidence shows that the expression of the specific nonmuscle MHC isoforms is dependent on cell types and is linked to cell proliferation and differentiation, especially in neuronal and muscle cells. However, the regulatory mechanisms controlling the expression of nonmuscle MHC genes have not yet been elucidated. We have recently cloned and characterized the promoter region of the human nonmuscle MHC-A gene (18Kawamoto S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15101-15110Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The structure of this region shows many features typical of a housekeeping gene. There is no TATA element and the GC content is high, with multiple GC boxes. Weir and Chen (19Weir L. Chen D. Gene Exp. 1996; 6: 45-57PubMed Google Scholar) have isolated genomic clones which encode the promoter regions of human and mouse nonmuscle MHC-B genes. These genes also lack a TATA element and the GC content is high. The finding that the nonmuscle MHC-A and -B genes belong to the housekeeping gene family, based on sequence and structural features of the promoter regions, is consistent with the previous reports that both genes are expressed in a wide variety of cell types and tissues. However, as noted, there are differences in expression of these genes among different cells and tissues. The nonmuscle MHC-A gene is expressed abundantly in epithelial cells, lymphoid cells, and fibroblasts, but less abundantly in neuronal cells and differentiated muscle cells. Thus, we searched for the cis-regulatory elements that might be responsible for the regulation of nonmuscle MHC-A gene transcription. We report here a cell type-dependent enhancer activity found in intron 1, located in the 23-kb downstream region from the transcriptional start sites of the human nonmuscle MHC-A gene. We identified three clustered protein-binding elements, one of which is recognized specifically by the Sp1 and Sp3 transcriptional factors. The core promoter luciferase reporter plasmid contains the core promoter of the human nonmuscle MHC-A gene which corresponds to the sequence between −112 and +61 (where +1 is a major transcription start site) inserted at a HindIII site in a promoterless luciferase reporter vector pGL2 basic (Promega) and has been described (18Kawamoto S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15101-15110Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This plasmid was used as a host vector to make all constructs described below. Construct 5.9(±) was constructed by inserting a 5.9-kbBglII fragment in intron 1 (see Fig. 1) into the core promoter luciferase plasmid at a BglII site, located upstream to the core promoter, in the same (+) and opposite (−) orientations. Constructs 0.9(+), 2.8(±), and 2.2(−) were constructed by deleting appropriate restriction fragments from constructs 5.9(±) to preserve the 0.9-kb (BglII-SpeI), 2.8-kb (SpeI-NdeI), and 2.2-kb (NdeI-BglII) portion of the 5.9-kb fragment, respectively. Defined fragments were generated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from the 2.8 construct using appropriate synthetic primers. All primers contain a BamHI site at their 5′ ends and PCR products were inserted into the core promoter luciferase plasmid at a BglII site. The wild-type construct 1 includes the 120-bp fragment, N2d′, corresponding to the 100-bp N2d region in addition to 10 bp of flanking sequences at both sides, at aBglII site in the core promoter luciferase plasmid. The 120-bp fragments which contain mutations at elements A, C, and F (see text) in various combinations in the context of N2d′ were generated by recombinant PCR (20Higuchi R. Innis M.A. Gelfand D.H. Sninsky J.J. White T.J. PCR Protocols. Academic Press Inc., San Diego1990: 177-183Google Scholar) and inserted at a BglII site in the core promoter luciferase plasmid. The mutated nucleotides at elements A, C, and F are the same as those in mutant oligonucleotides m1-m4 described below. All PCRs were performed using Vent (New England Biolabs, Inc.) and Pfu (Stratagene) DNA polymerases. The fidelity of all constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. Control luciferase expression plasmids which contain the SV40 early promoter (pGL2 promoter) and SV40 early promoter and enhancer (pGL2 control) are from Promega. The β-galactosidase expression vectors containing SV40 promoter and enhancer (pSV-β-Gal) and Rous sarcoma virus long terminal repeat (pRSV-β-Gal) were from Promega and Dr. M. Reitman (NIDDK), respectively. NIH 3T3 and C2C12 cells were cultured as described (18Kawamoto S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15101-15110Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Transient transfection of test luciferase plasmids and control β-galactosidase plasmids were performed by the calcium-phosphate-DNA coprecipitation method as described previously (18Kawamoto S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15101-15110Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Transfected cells were harvested in a reporter lysis buffer (Promega) and the activities of luciferase and β-galactosidase were assayed using substrate mixtures from Promega. Both luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were determined to be in the linear range. Nuclear extracts from NIH 3T3 cells were prepared as described (21Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Current Protocols, U. S. A.1990Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford method (Bio-Rad) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. The 100-bp N2d DNA was generated by PCR. Double-stranded oligonucleotides N2d1-N2d6 and m1-m4 were prepared by annealing two complemental strands of synthetic oligonucleotides which were purified by high pressure liquid chromatography, followed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis purification. The upper strand sequence of each oligonucleotide is as follows: N2d1, 5′-tcggaattcGGGAGGGGCCGCGTGACCCTTCACTTTGCCaggccttga-3′; N2d2, 5′-ACCCTTCACTTTGCCAAGGCTGGCGGGATC-3′; N2d3, 5′-AAGGCTGGCGGGATCAGATGATGTAAACAC-3′; N2d4, AGATGATGTAAACACCACGAGATGAATGTG-3′; N2d5, 5′-ctcggatccCACGAGATGAATGTGTCAGGTGATTGGGTTggatccctc-3′; N2d6, 5′-TCAGGTGATTGGGTTGCTACAGCTGAGTCT-3′; m1, 5′-ctcggatccTACGTACAGCGCGTGACCCTTCACTTTGCCagatctgtc-3′; m2, 5′-ctcggatccGGGAGGGGCGTAAATGATCTTCACTTTGCCagatctgtc-3′; m3, ctcggatccTACGTACAGGTAAATGATCTTCACTTTGCCagatctgtc-3′; and m4, 5′-ctcggatccCACGAGATGAATGCAAATCAGAATTGGGTTagatctgtc-3′. Lowercase letters and underlined letters represent adaptor sequences, including restriction enzyme sites and mutated sequences, respectively. N2d1 and N2d5 DNAs used in Fig. 3 do not contain the adaptor sequences shown in lowercase letters. Double strand oligonucleotides which include authentic binding sites for specific transcription factors and their mutant forms were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. All DNA probes were 5′ end-labeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP (7000 Ci/mmol, ICN Radiochemicals). Antibodies to specific transcriptional factors used in gel shift assays were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. Binding reactions for gel shift assays were carried out in a 10-μl mixture that contains 4–6 μg of nuclear extracts (unless otherwise indicated), ∼5 × 104 cpm (∼2f mol) of DNA probe, 0.5 μg of poly(dI-dC), 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 4 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.9), 50 mm NaCl, 20 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.54 mm EDTA, 0.6 mm dithiothreitol, and 8% glycerol. For competition experiments, the indicated amounts of unlabeled DNA were preincubated for 15–20 min at room temperature before addition of the probe. For antibody supershift experiments, 1 μg of indicated antibodies was preincubated for 1.5 h on ice or 45 min at room temperature, prior to addition of the probe. Following incubation of the reaction mixture for 20 min at room temperature after addition of the probe, the samples were subjected to electrophoresis in a 4% polyacrylamide gel (Fig. 3) or a 6% polyacrylamide gel (Figs. 4,Figure 6, Figure 7, Figure 8, Figure 9, and 11) in 0.5 × Tris borate-EDTA buffer.Figure 11Participation of E-box-binding proteins in the N2d5-protein complex. A, competition of the consensus sequences for E-box binding transcription factors for N2d5-protein complexes. The consensus binding sequences for E-box-binding proteins, Myc-Max, USF, and MEF-1, as well as their mutant sequences (Myc-Maxm, USFm, and MEF-1m), are used as competitors for N2d5-protein complex formation with NIH 3T3 nuclear extracts in gel mobility shift assays. DNA-protein complexes f1-f3 are indicated. The concentrations of unlabeled competitors are shown as molar excess relative to the probe concentration. B, USF or USF-related protein is a component of complex f2. Antibodies specific to E-box binding transcriptional factors indicated (Ab.) are used in gel mobility shift assays performed using the N2d5 probe and NIH 3T3 nuclear extracts. Complexes f1-f3 formed in the absence of antibodies (Ab. −) are indicated. An arrowhead withSS represents supershifted complexes formed due to binding of antibodies specific to USF1 and USF2 (lane 8).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Methylation interference analyses were performed according to a protocol previously described (21Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Current Protocols, U. S. A.1990Google Scholar). The final reaction products were analyzed on urea-13% polyacrylamide gels. We previously isolated genomic clones which encode the promoter and flanking region (∼70 kb) of human nonmuscle MHC-A and characterized the core promoter and proximal regulatory regions (18Kawamoto S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15101-15110Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In an attempt to identify cell type-specific cis-regulatory elements, we now examined the region extending ∼20 kb upstream and ∼40 kb downstream from the transcriptional start sites, which includes the 37-kb intron 1. The genomic DNA clones were fragmented by restriction enzymes (BglII and BamHI) and introduced upstream to the MHC-A core promoter in the luciferase reporter constructs. Following transfection into NIH 3T3 fibroblasts, a 5.9-kb fragment in intron 1, that is located 21–27 kb downstream from the transcriptional start sites, was found to enhance transcriptional activity 5–10-fold (Fig. 1). We also examined the cis-acting influence of this 5.9-kb fragment in a myogenic cell line, C2C12, in both proliferating and terminally differentiated cells. The proliferating C2C12 myoblasts express nonmuscle MHC-A as abundantly as fibroblasts. However, when C2C12 cells terminally differentiate to form multinucleated myotubes, nonmuscle MHC expression is dramatically decreased. Concomitantly, the sarcomeric MHC begins to be expressed and becomes the dominant myosin isoform, as in skeletal muscle. As shown in Fig. 1, the 5.9-kb fragment causes a 3–6-fold increase in luciferase activity in proliferating C2C12 myoblasts. In contrast, the same 5.9-kb fragment causes a 2–3-fold decrease in activity in differentiated C2C12 myotubes compared with the basal promoter. The different effects of the 5.9-kb fragment on transcription in different cell backgrounds are consistent with the differences in relative mRNA levels of endogenous nonmuscle MHC-A in these cells. The 5.9-kb fragment was subdivided into the three fragments (0.9, 2.8, and 2.2 kb) based on the presence of convenient restriction enzyme sites, and the effect of each fragment on transcriptional activity was examined (Fig. 1). Enhancement of transcription by the 5.9-kb fragment observed in NIH 3T3 and proliferating C2C12 myoblasts is confined to the 2.8-kb fragment in both cell types. Transcription of this fragment, however, is unchanged in differentiated C2C12 myotubes. The 2.2-kb fragment causes a 2-fold decrease in transcription in C2C12 myotubes, whereas this has no effect in NIH 3T3 and C2C12 myoblasts. Thus, the enhancer activity observed in NIH 3T3 cells and proliferating myoblasts and the repressor activity observed in differentiated C2C12 myotubes are located in distinct regions within a 5.9-kb fragment. In this report, we now focus on identifying and characterizing the cis-acting elements and trans-acting factors responsible for high expression of the nonmuscle MHC-A gene in fibroblasts. In an effort to localize the region responsible for the enhanced activity due to the 2.8-kb fragment, this fragment was progressively narrowed down using PCR generated overlapping fragments which were introduced into the luciferase reporter construct in both orientations. As shown in Fig. 2, the first set of analyses (N1-N9) demonstrates that three 450-bp fragments, N2, N3, and N7, possess enhancer activity in an NIH 3T3 background. The second set of reporter constructs, N2a-N2f and N7a-N7d, cover the region N2 plus N3 and N7, respectively. Analysis of these constructs defines a 100-bp fragment, N2d, with maximum enhancer activity (∼20-fold) (Fig. 2). The nucleotide sequence of the N2d fragment is shown in Fig. 13. The activity of the N2d fragment still shows cell type dependence (Fig. 1). Maximal activation due to the N2d fragment is seen in NIH 3T3 (∼20-fold). C2C12 myoblasts show intermediate activation (∼7-fold). In contrast, transcription in differentiated C2C12 myotubes show only 2–3-fold activation. Thus, the N2d fragment, which is located 23 kb downstream from transcriptional start sites, possess a cell type- and differentiation state-dependent transcriptional enhancer activity.Figure 13Cis-elements and trans-factors regulating nonmuscle myosin II heavy chain-A gene. Nucleotide sequence of the N2d′ region (1–120) are shown. The sequence of the N2d region corresponds to the sequence from 11 to 110. Protein binding elements C, A, and F determined in this study are indicated. Transcriptional factors Sp1 and Sp3 bind to element C. The curved arrows represent a possible functional interaction.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We then undertook to identify cis-regulatory elements in the 100-bp N2d fragment by in vitro DNA-protein binding analysis. To see whether the N2d fragment recognizes specific nuclear protein(s), a gel mobility shift assay was performed using the N2d fragment as a probe. As shown in Fig. 3 B, two different complexes (I and II) were demonstrated using nuclear extracts prepared from NIH 3T3 cells (lane 2). The nonradioactive N2d fragment, as well as the overlapping 30-bp double-stranded oligonucleotide subfragments located in N2d (Fig. 3 A), were used as competitors. The N2d1 subfragment, as well as the entire N2d fragment, compete efficiently to displace the labeled probe in both complexes (lanes 3–5). The N2d5 subfragment, which is distant from N2d1, also competes effectively for complex I formation (× 10 excess competitor) and less effectively for complex II formation (× 100 excess competitor) (lanes 12 and 13). The other subfragments have less or no effect on complex formation. In parallel experiments, these oligonucleotide subfragments were also used as probes (Fig. 3 C). N2d1 forms multiple complexes with similar mobility, resulting in broad shifted bands (III) (in lane 2) and N2d5 also forms an apparent single complex (IV) (in lane 14) in this gel system. The other probes, however, do not form any significant complexes. These results suggest that at least two sites in the 100-bp N2d fragment interact with NIH 3T3 nuclear proteins. To characterize these DNA-protein complexes further, we made use of a high resolution gel electrophoresis system with higher acrylamide gel concentrations. Using the N2d1 probe and NIH 3T3 nuclear extracts, as shown in Fig. 4, one major DNA-protein complex (a) is observed with a low amount of nuclear proteins (lane 1). With increasing amounts of nuclear proteins, three complexes b, c (appears as doublet c1 and c2), and d are detected (lanes 2–5). With the highest amount of nuclear proteins (lane 5), complex d becomes the dominant species, while complex a becomes a minor species. These results suggest that the N2d1 probe can recruit different proteins or different protein complexes through either a single or multiple protein-binding sites. To examine if these complexes bind to a distinct region of the N2d1 probe, methylation interference assays were carried out for each of the complexes. Strong interference with protein binding due to methylation of G residues (and some A residues) is indicated by solid circles and weak interference by open circles in Fig. 5. These marked residues contact proteins and are required for protein-DNA complex formation. The complexes a and c1 + c2 bind to two distinct sequences within the 30-bp N2d1 probe. These binding sites are designated element A (GTGACCC) for complex a and element C (GGGAGGGGCC) for complex c1 + c2. Interestingly, complex d binds to both elements A and C. We next evaluated how mutations in each of the elements affects formation of each of the N2d1-protein complexes (Fig. 6). The unlabeled wild-type N2d1 competes effectively with the labeled N2d1 probe for all complex formations, resulting in disappearance of all labeled N2d1-protein complexes, as expected (lanes 2 and 3). The mutant m1, which has mutations in element C, can compete with the N2d1 probe for formation of complexes a, b, and d, whereas it does not affect c1 and c2 complex formation (lanes 4 and 5), implying that complexes a, b, and d require element A, but complexes c1 and c2 do not. On the other hand, mutant m2, which has mutations in element A, competes for formation of the c1, c2, and d complexes, but not for formation of a and b complexes (lanes 6 and 7), implying that element C is required for c1, c2, and d complexes, but not for a and b complexes. The mutant m3, which is mutated in both elements A and C, does not affect any complex formation, indicating that no other sequences besides elements A and C are required for complex formation. These results are consistent with the data obtained from methylation interference assays and establish that complex a requires only the A element whereas complexes c1 and c2 require only the C element and complex d requires both A and C elements. Moreover, the above data also indicate that b complex shares the same binding sequences with complex a, although the b complex was not analyzed by methylation interference assays. The sequences of the two elements A and C do not show complete identity with any known binding sites for transcription factors. However, the C element sequence (GGGAGGGGCC) resembles the consensus sequence for the Sp1-binding site (GGGGCGGGGC) (22Kadonaga J.T. Jones K.A. Tjian R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1986; 11: 20-23Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (878) Google Scholar). Therefore, the authentic Sp1-binding sequence as well as other known transcription factor binding sequences, which are rich in G residues, were tested for their effects on N2d1-protein complex formation in gel shift assays. As shown in Fig. 7, excess amounts of the unlabeled consensus Sp1-binding sequence is able to compete specifically for complexes c1, c2, and d, but not for complexes a and b using the N2d1 probe (lane 3). In contrast, these complexes are not affected by the presence of the same amounts of a mutated Sp1-binding sequence (Sp1m) (lane 4), demonstrating the specificity of competition"

Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1987; 10: 195-236Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Five different mammalian mAChR subtypes (m1–m5) and four chicken mAChR subtypes (m2–m5) have been identified and shown to be encoded by separate genes (2Bonner T.I. Trends Neurosci. 1989; 12: 148-151Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar, 3Hulme E.C. Birdsall N.J.M. Buckley N.J. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1990; 30: 633-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (1098) Google Scholar). The m1, m3, and m5 subtypes preferentially couple to the stimulation of phospholipase C, whereas the m2 and m4 subtypes preferentially couple to the inhibition of adenylyl cyclase. The different mAChR subtypes have unique overlapping expression patterns and are found in the central nervous system, peripheral nervous system, smooth muscle, and heart (4Caulfield M.P. Pharmacol. Ther. 1993; 58: 319-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (1160) Google Scholar). The m2 subtype is the main mAChR found in mammalian heart (5Peralta E.G. Ashkenazi A. Winslow J.W. Smith D.H. Ramachandran J. Capon D.J. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 3923-3929Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar); however, chick heart expresses predominantly m2 with significant amounts of m4 and m3 (6McKinnon L.A. Nathanson N.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20636-20642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Cardiac mAChR activation causes a decrease in both the rate and force of contraction (7Katz A.M. Physiology of the Heart. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1977Google Scholar). These effects are mediated through the inhibition of adenylyl cyclase activity, activation of an inward-rectifying potassium channel, inhibition of a calcium channel, and inhibition of the hyperpolarization-activated pacemaker current. Since the initial discovery of multiple muscarinic acetylcholine receptor subtypes, great effort has been made to understand the expression patterns and, ultimately, the function of the different subtypes. Although many advances have been made in determining the expression patterns of the different muscarinic receptor subtypes, little is known about the molecular mechanisms that determine these patterns. The isolation of promoter regions for the m1, m2, and m4 receptor genes has been recently reported (8Pepitoni S. Wood I.C. Buckley N.J. J. Biol.

The mechanisms governing neural-specific expression of muscarinic receptors are beginning to be understood. For example, the m4 receptor contains a repressor element 1/neuron restrictive silencer element that plays a role in determination of neural-specific expression (10Mieda M. Haga T. Saffen D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5177-5182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In addition, we have demonstrated activation of the m2 promoter by the cytokines ciliary neurotrophic factor and leukemia inhibitory factor in mammalian neural cell lines. The mechanisms that regulate expression of the m2 receptor in heart are for the most part unknown. Previously, we identified regions of the chick m2 promoter necessary for basal level expression in chick heart primary cultures (9Rosoff M.L. Wei J. Nathanson N.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14889-14894Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). We sought to determine if the GATA family of transcription factors plays a role in expression of the m2 receptor gene in heart. The founding member of the GATA family of transcription factors (GATA-1) was first identified as a determinant of lineage-specific gene expression during hematopoiesis that bound to the DNA sequence (A/T)GATA(A/G) found in the promoter region of several erythroid-specific genes (12Orkin S.H.

Two transcripts for chick GATA-5, designated GATA-5 short and long, are produced by the use of alternative exons. The short GATA-5 isoform contains a single zinc finger and binds DNA but has decreased ability to transactivate GATA-responsive promoters (20MacNeill C. Ayres B. Laverriere A.C. Burch J.B. J. Biol.

In this manuscript we demonstrate 1) transactivation of m2 reporter constructs by the GATA family of transcription factors, 2) determination of the GATA-responsive element in the m2 promoter, 3) binding of a chick heart nuclear protein to the GATA-responsive element, and 4) regulation of basal level expression of m2 in chick heart primary cultures by the GATA-responsive element. Primary chicken heart cultures were prepared from 9-day embryos as described and grown in either defined media or medium M199 supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin, streptomycin at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 environment (25Subers E.M. Nathanson N.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19685-19693Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For transfections, cells were plated out into 24-well plates and transfected 60 h later with either Transfectam reagent (Promega), for cells grown in defined media, or by the calcium phosphate method as described (9Rosoff M.L. Wei J. Nathanson N.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14889-14894Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 26Luthman H. Magnusson G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1295-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). For Transfectam transfections, the transfection mixture contained 100 ng/well pSV-β-galactosidase (Promega) to correct for minor differences in transfection efficiency and 0.037 pmol/well reporter construct (117–134 ng) brought to a final total DNA concentration of 234 ng/well with pGEM4 (Promega) carrier DNA. The calcium phosphate transfection mixture contained 100 ng/well pSV-β-galactosidase (Promega) and 0.048 pmol (153–183 ng) of reporter construct brought to a final amount of 283 ng with carrier DNA. Cells were lysed 32 h after the addition of transfection mixture. The human choriocarcinoma cell line JEG-3 (American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, MD) was grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin, streptomycin at 37° in a humidified 10% CO2 environment. Cells were plated at a density of 20,000/well into 24-well plates, transfected 48 h after plating, and harvested 48 h later as described (27Migeon J.C. Nathanson N.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9767-9773Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The transfection mixture contained 177 ng/well reporter construct and varying amounts of GATA factor expression plasmids. A plasmid containing thelacZ gene driven by the Rous sarcoma virus promoter (RSV-β-galactosidase) was included to correct for minor differences in transfection efficiencies (28Edlund T. Walker M.D. Barr P.J. Rutter W.J. Science. 1985; 230: 912-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). The total DNA concentration was kept constant by the addition of empty expression vector. COS-7 cells (American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, MD) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin, streptomycin at 37° in a humidified 10% CO2 environment. Transfections were performed by the calcium phosphate method. Briefly, calcium phosphate precipitates containing 17 μg of either GATA factor expression constructs or empty expression vector were added to 10-cm dishes grown to approximately 70–90% confluency. Luciferase activities were determined using a Berthold AutoLumat LB 953 as described (27Migeon J.C. Nathanson N.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9767-9773Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). β-Galactosidase activity was determined using the o-nitrophenyl β-d-galactopyranoside colorimetric assay for cells transfected by the calcium phosphate method and the Galactolight chemiluminescent assay (Tropix) for cells transfected with Transfectam (27Migeon J.C. Nathanson N.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9767-9773Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The luciferase activity was normalized to β-galactosidase activity and in some cases expressed as -fold above the luciferase/β-galactosidase activity of promoterless luciferase vector (pGL3 Basic). Heart cell nuclear extracts were isolated from 9-day embryonic chick heart primary cultures grown in defined media 96 h after plating as described (29Zou Y. Chien K.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2972-2982Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Whole cell extracts were prepared from COS-7 cells 36 h after the addition of transfection mixture as described (30Latchman D.S. Transcription Factors: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford1993Google Scholar). Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) were performed as described (30Latchman D.S. Transcription Factors: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford1993Google Scholar). Briefly, 10 fmol of double-stranded oligonucleotides labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase were used as the probe. Experiments were performed with either 1.5–2.5 μg of nuclear extracts isolated from 9-day embryonic chick heart primary cultures or 2.2 μl of whole cell mini-extracts isolated from COS-7 cells. Binding reaction components were added in the following order: 1) buffer, salts, and nonspecific DNA; 2) protein extracts; 3) cold competitor DNA; and 4) probe. Antibody, either 5 μg of anti-HA or 100 ng of anti-myc, was added 10 min after the addition of probe for supershift experiments. The binding reaction was incubated on ice for 45 min and separated on a 5% polyacrylamide 0.25× Tris borate-EDTA gel prerun for 2 h at 4 °C. The dried gel was exposed to Kodak X-Omat film at −70 °C with two Dupont lightning intensifying screens for the indicated time. Double-stranded oligonucleotides used were: 3′-GATA, 5′-GATCATGGAAGAGAAAGATAAAGCGGCTGCC-3′; 3′-GGTA, 5′-ATGGAAGAGAAAGGTAAAGCGGCTGCC-3′; MID-GATA, 5′-CTAGTAAGCTAGGTTTGATAGCTCTGTGTAT-3′; 5′-GATA, 5′-CTAGGAAATATGAATTATCATCGGCTCACTT-3′. Synthetic GATA site, 5′-TGCGGATAGATAAGGCCGGAATTCGGATC-3′. The constructs pNMR26-29 containing 789 bp, 2 kbp, 3.3 kbp, and 8 kbp fragments, respectively, of the m2 promoter cloned into the pGL3 Basic (Promega) luciferase reporter gene vector have been previously described (9Rosoff M.L. Wei J. Nathanson N.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14889-14894Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The m2 789-bp reporter construct was used as a template for polymerase chain reaction overlap site-directed mutagenesis (31Inc., New York.Google Scholar) using Pfu polymerase (Stratagene). All polymerase chain reaction constructs were sequenced with the Applied Biosystems Taq Dye Terminator Sequence kit to ensure the GATA to GGTA change and the absence of secondary mutations. The plasmid pAP/GATA was constructed by placing a synthetic GATA, 5′-TGCGGATAAGATAAGGCCGGAATT-3′, site upstream of the −44 to +71 region of the human liver/bone/kidney alkaline phosphatase gene (32Weiss M.J. Ray K. Henthorn P.S. Lamb B. Kadesch T. Harris H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 12002-12010Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The resulting synthetic promoter was cloned into pGL3 Basic. The PYP-GATA-6 expression plasmid contains the GATA-6 coding region from the sequence PVYVP (amino acid 42) to the stop codon in the expression vector pR18 (33Pei D.Q. Shih C.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1480-1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Expression constructs containing the coding region of the two chicken GATA-5 isoforms (GATA-5S and GATA-5L) inserted into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) have been reported previously (20MacNeill C. Ayres B. Laverriere A.C. Burch J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8396-8401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The PYP-GATA-4 expression construct contains the largest cDNA isolated for GATA-4 inserted into pR18 and begins at the conserved PVYVP found in GATA-4-6 (18Laverriere A.C. MacNeill C. Mueller C. Poelmann R.E. Burch J.B. Evans T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23177-23184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The HA-GATA-5 and HA-GATA-6 contain the HA epitope (34Field J. Nikawa J. Broek D.

Biol. 1988; 8: 2159-2165Crossref PubMed Scopus (733) Google Scholar) fused in-frame to the initiating methionine of the entire GATA-5(long isoform) and GATA-6 inserted into pcDNA3. The MYC-GATA-5 and MYC-GATA-6 constructs contain five copies of the myc epitope (35Roth M.B. Zahler A.M. Stolk J.A. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 587-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar) from pCST+MT (kindly donated by D. Turner, R. Rupp, and H. Weintraub) fused in-frame to the initiator methionine of GATA-5(long) and GATA-6, respectively, inserted into pcDNA3. Expression constructs for Xenopus GATA-4, -5, and -6 (16Jiang Y. Evans T. Dev. Biol. 1996; 174: 258-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) contained the entire coding region inserted into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). Ten microliters of the whole cell extracts used for EMSA were separated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to nitrocellulose using standard conditions (36Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Duplicate blots were probed with either anti-HA (5 μg/ml final) or anti-myc (100 ng/ml final) monoclonal Ab. After incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary Ab, the blots were developed with the Renaissance chemiluminescent reagent (NEN Life Science Products) and exposed to Kodak X-Omat x-ray film. [γ-32P]ATP was purchased from NEN. All restriction enzymes and T4 polynucleotide kinase were purchased from New England Biolabs. Pfu polymerase was purchased from Stratagene. The anti-HA monoclonal Ab (12CA5) was purchased from Boehringer Mannheim, and the anti-c-myc monoclonal Ab (9E10) was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-mouse and donkey anti-rabbit antibodies were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. We utilized a heterologous system consisting of the human choriocarcinoma cell line JEG-3, which express very low levels of mAChR, to determine whether chick GATA factors were capable of transactivating m2 reporter gene constructs and what promoter region may be responsible for activation. Preliminary experiments2 demonstrated that GATA-6 transactivated the m2 promoter at levels higher than GATA-4 or -5. Cotransfection of equimolar amounts of vector alone (pGL3) or either the 789 bp, 2 kbp, 3.3 kbp, or 8 kbp m2 promoter reporter gene constructs along with PYP-GATA-6 and an RSV-β-galactosidase plasmid, to correct for minor differences in transfection efficiency, resulted in an increase in m2 promoter-driven luciferase expression (45–63-fold above pGL3 alone) compared with basal levels (2–7-fold above pGL3 alone) (Fig. 1). A positive control plasmid pAP/GATA containing a minimal promoter region from the human alkaline phosphatase gene downstream of a synthetic consensus GATA binding site (see “Experimental Procedures”) showed an increase from 3- to 26-fold above pGL3 alone when PYP-GATA-6 was cotransfected. Although the various m2 luciferase constructs displayed different basal levels of expression (37Merika M. Orkin S.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3999-4010Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar), cotransfection of PYP-GATA-6 resulted in similar m2-driven luciferase expression, indicating that the GATA-responsive element is located within the 789-bp promoter fragment. Sequence analysis identified three consensus GATA factor binding sites (37Merika M. Orkin S.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3999-4010Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar, 38Ko L.J. Engel J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4011-4022Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar) located at positions −150, −500, and −580 bp in the m2 promoter (Fig. 2 A). The site present at −150 bp, designated the 3′ site, is located 208 bp downstream of the most 3′ start site of transcription. The two other sites, located at 142 and 222 bp upstream of the most 3′ start site of transcription, were designated the MID and 5′ sites, respectively. We wanted to determine if the chick GATA-4, -5, and -6 were capable of transactivating the m2 promoter in our heterologous system. Increasing amounts of the expression constructs PYP-GATA-4, GATA-5L, GATA-5S, and PYP-GATA-6 (see “Experimental Procedures”) were cotransfected with the 789-bp m2 reporter gene construct into JEG-3 cells. An RSV-β-galactosidase plasmid was included to correct for minor differences in transfection efficiencies. The PYP-GATA-4, GATA-5L, and PYP-GATA-6 were capable of transactivating the m2 789-bp promoter, albeit at different levels, whereas the GATA-5S did not transactivate the m2 789-bp promoter (Fig. 2 B). The levels of transactivation for PYP-GATA-6 and PYP-GATA-4 peak at 75 ng of expression plasmid/well and decrease with higher amounts of expression plasmid, whereas the GATA-5L shows the highest transactivation when 150 ng/well expression plasmid is cotransfected. In this system, PYP-GATA-6 transactivates the m2 promoter the greatest (43 ± 4-fold increase) with PYP-GATA-4 and GATA-5L transactivating less (18 ± 2 and 6 ± 2). Neither the Xenopus GATA-4, -5, nor -6 were capable of transactivating the m2 promoter in this system. 2M. Rosoff and N. Nathanson, unpublished observation. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to change the three consensus GATA sites to GGTA in the 789-bp m2 reporter gene construct. The wild type and mutant constructs were transfected into 9-day embryonic primary chick heart cultures grown in either defined media (Fig. 3 A) or M199 supplemented with 5% FBS (Fig. 3 B). Cultures were transfected using Transfectam reagent (Fig. 3 A) or by the calcium phosphate method (Fig. 3 B). The two culture and transfection methods were used to ensure that our results were not biased by selective transfection of a subpopulation of the multiple cell types found in chick heart primary cultures. Changing a single adenine to guanine nucleotide in the 3′-GATA site of the 789-bp promoter region reduced the basal level expression to 25 ± 6 and 22 ± 1% that of the wild type construct for cultures grown in defined media and M199, 5% fetal bovine serum, respectively (Fig. 3,A and B). Mutating the other consensus GATA sites resulted in little or no change in the basal level expression for cultures grown in defined media. However, mutating the MID-GATA site resulted in decreasing the basal activity to 67 ± 2% that of wild type for cultures supplemented with fetal bovine serum. Any combination of the 3′-GGTA with either the 5′-GGTA or MID-GGTA resulted in a similar decrease found with constructs containing only the 3′-GGTA. Mutating all three GATA sites resulted in slightly greater decreases in basal activity (20 ± 4 and 17 ± 3% that of wild type) for cultures grown in defined media and M199, fetal bovine serum, respectively. Similar results were seen when the mutant constructs were cotransfected with PYP-cGATA6 into JEG-3 cells.2 Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed with nuclear extracts isolated from chick primary heart cultures grown in defined media to determine if the 3′-GATA site shown to be functionally important was a binding site for a nuclear protein. A 32P end-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide for the 3′-GATA site was incubated with nuclear extracts isolated from 9-day embryonic chick heart primary cultures grown in defined media. The products of the binding reaction were separated on a native polyacrylamide gel and subjected to autoradiography. Two different protein-DNA complexes were detected (Fig. 4, A–C). Competition experiments demonstrated that the binding of the slower mobility complex could be competed off, whereas the binding of the faster mobility complex was decreased but not eliminated by 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled 3′-GATA probe (Fig. 4 A). These results suggest that at least one specific protein binds the 3′-GATA site and that the faster mobility band may be composed of either a protein that has higher affinity for binding or two proteins, one of which shows specific binding to this site. Unlabeled 5′ and MID-GATA probe showed much less competition for binding by both proteins to the 3′-GATA site but had some effect when a 100-fold excess was used (Fig. 4, A and B). The mutant 3′-GGTA did not compete for binding of either proteins even in a 100-fold molar excess (Fig. 4 C). We were unable to reproducibly detect any protein-DNA complexes when the MID and 5′-GATA sites were used as probes.2 Although it is reasonable to postulate that one (or more) of the chicken GATA factors is the nuclear protein that binds to the 3′ site, the lack of antisera against chick GATA-4, -5, or -6 prevents determination of whether the 3′-GATA protein-DNA complex contains either chick GATA-4, -5, or -6. Since there are no antibodies available for chick GATA -4, -5, or -6, we epitope-tagged the chick GATA-5 and -6 at the N terminus with either one copy of the HA epitope (39Wilson I.A. Niman H.L. Houghten R.A. Cherenson A.R. Connolly M.L. Lerner R.A. Cell. 1984; 37: 767-778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar) or five copies of the myc epitope (35Roth M.B. Zahler A.M. Stolk J.A. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 587-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). The epitope-tagged GATA-5 and -6 transactivated the 789-bp m2 reporter construct in JEG-3 cells with similar abilities relative to the non-tagged versions (GATA-5L, 6.6 ± 0.9-fold increase; HA-GATA-5, 10.3 ± 1.0; myc-GATA-5, 40.4 ± 4.6; PYP-GATA-6, 41.2 ± 3.6; HA-GATA-6, 75.4 ± 11.9; myc-GATA-6, 135.7 ± 23.3; mean ± S.E.,n = 3). We were unable to express functionally active N-terminal myc or HA-tagged PYP-GATA-4.2 To determine if GATA-4, -5, and -6 were capable of binding to the 3′-GATA site in vitro, whole cell extracts isolated from COS-7 cells transiently transfected with expression constructs for chick PYP-GATA-4 and epitope-tagged GATA-5L and 6 were used for EMSA with the 3′-GATA site probe (Fig. 5). Experiments performed with extracts from cells transfected with PYP-GATA-4, myc-tagged GATA-5 or GATA-6 (myc-GATA-5, myc-GATA-6), and HA-tagged GATA-5 or -6 (HA-GATA-5, HA-GATA-6) show a single protein-DNA complex that is not present in binding reactions performed with extracts from cells transfected with empty expression vector or untransfected cells. The formation of this complex can be eliminated by including a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled competitor in the binding reaction (Fig. 5). The addition of monoclonal antibodies to the HA or Myc epitope to the binding reactions produced a “supershift” of the protein-DNA complexes that was proportional to the number of epitopes present in the tagged GATA factors (1 epitope for HA versus 5 for myc). Competition experiments demonstrated that the specificity of chick GATA -4, -5, and -6 for the 3′-GATA site (Fig. 6) was similar to results observed with chick heart nuclear extracts (Fig. 4). Western blot analysis demonstrated that the myc-tagged GATA-6 was expressed at higher levels than the myc-tagged GATA-5, and the extent of transactivation of the m2 promoter by the myc-tagged constructs was proportional to the relative levels of protein expression (Fig. 7). The HA-tagged GATA-5 and GATA-6 are expressed at comparable levels and, in the experiment shown, HA-GATA-5 is expressed at slightly higher levels (Fig. 7). The ability of the HA-tagged GATA constructs to transactivate the m2 promoter do not appear to be dependent on the relative protein levels detected by Western blot analysis (Fig. 7).Figure 6Competition experiments performed with chick GATA-4, -5, and -6 overexpressed in COS-7 cells. Nuclear extracts from COS-7 cells transfected with PYP-GATA-4 (A), myc-GATA-5L (B), or myc-GATA-6 (C) were incubated with 32P-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotides for the 3′-GATA site and electrophoresed on a 5% polyacrylamide 0.25× Tris borate-EDTA gel. The dried gel was exposed to film for 16 h.0, 0 competitor; 5′ GATA, 5′ m2 GATA site;M, middle m2 GATA site.

In this system, truncated versions of the chick GATA-4 and -6 were capable of transactivating the m2 promoter, in agreement with a recent report demonstrating that mouse GATA-4 containing an N-terminal truncation at the PVYVP motif conserved between mouse, human, chick, and Xenopus shows the same activity as the full-length protein when cotransfected into NIH-3T3 cells (40Morrisey E.E. Ip H.S. Tang Z. Parmacek M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8515-8524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). In contrast to the GATA-5 long isoform, the GATA-5 short isoform was incapable of transactivating the m2 promoter. Similar results have been reported using a different promoter in COS-7 cells (20MacNeill C. Ayres B. Laverriere A.C. Burch J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8396-8401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Cotransfection of GATA-5L into chick heart primary cultures with the 789-bp m2 reporter plasmid resulted in an increase in m2-driven luciferase expression, whereas cotransfection of the GATA-5S had no effect.2 Therefore, it is unlikely that the short GATA-5S isoform acts as a negative regulator of m2 transcription in heart. Mutation of the 3′-GATA site in the m2 promoter drastically decreased the basal level activity in chick heart primary cultures, suggesting that the results from our heterologous system are relevant to cardiac regulation of m2 in vivo. Several reports implicate GATA-4, -5, and -6 involvement in early cardiac development (15Kelley C. Blumberg H. Zon L.I. Evans T.

In mouse and XenopusGATA-4, -5, -6, expression was present in mesoderm during gastrulation (15Kelley C. Blumberg H. Zon L.I. Evans T.

Mutating the GATA sites in the m2 promoter does not completely eliminate basal level expression in chick heart primary cultures. Taken together, these results suggest that although GATA-4, -5, and -6, in combination with other transcription factors, may determine mAChR subtype-specific expression during cardiac differentiation, they are most likely required for but do not regulate chick m2 expression levels during development past embryonic day 4. Chick GATA-4, -5, -6 are incapable of transactivating a mouse m1 subtype mAChR promoter construct in JEG-3 cells,2consistent with a specific role for GATA-4, -5, and -6 in the regulation of cardiac mAChR expression. The identity of the GATA factor(s) that are required for maximal m2 expression in heart remains to be elucidated. Our data suggest that all three members of the GATA-4, -5, and -6 can family bind to and transactivate the m2 promoter. The abilities of the myc-tagged GATA constructs to transactivate m2 transcription in our heterologous system are proportional to the relative levels of protein demonstrated by Western blot analysis and by the intensity of the protein-DNA complexes seen by EMSA. In contrast, the relative abilities of the HA-tagged GATA constructs to transactivate m2 did not appear to be dependent on the amount of protein expressed as detected by Western blot analysis. These results suggest that GATA-6 may be better at transactivating transcription of m2 than GATA-5 when the two proteins are expressed at similar levels. This may reflect different binding affinities of GATA-5 or GATA-6 for the 3′-GATA element or differential interactions of GATA-5 and GATA-6 with other proteins required for transcription from the m2 promoter. We observed at least two protein complexes that can bind the 3′-GATA site in the m2 promoter when chick heart nuclear extracts were used for EMSA but only saw a single complex when GATA-4, -5, and -6 were overexpressed in COS-7 cells. The two complexes may contain different members of the GATA-4, -5, and -6 family or, alternatively, may contain a GATA factor and a cofactor. Recently, a novel factor, dubbed FOG, was found to associate with GATA-1 and synergistically activate transcription of a hematopoietic regulatory region (48Tsang A.P. Visvader J.E. Turner C.A. Fujiwara Y. Yu C. Weiss M.J. Crossley M. Orkin S.H. Cell. 1997; 90: 109-119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). Therefore, the two protein-DNA complexes may contain different combinations of GATA factors and/or cofactors. Preparation of subtype-specific antisera for the chick GATA-4, -5, and -6 will be necessary to clarify which GATA factor(s) are involved with regulation of m2 receptor expression in heart. The results presented here are the first identification of a transcription factor required for maximum basal level expression of a muscarinic acetylcholine receptor gene. Although we and others have identified promoter regions involved with the determination of neuronal expression of mAChR, the mechanisms determining cardiac-specific expression of mAChRs were previously unknown. Our results provide a framework for further studies to better understand the transcriptional regulation of the m2 gene in both heart and in neural tissue. We thank Dr. John B. Burch for his donation of the chick GATA-4, -5, and -6 expression plasmids and helpful discussions. We thank Dr. Todd Evans for donation of theXenopus GATA-4, -5, -6 expression plasmids.

The genetic defect is an expanding CTG trinucleotide repeat in the 3′-untranslated region of the myotonic dystrophy protein kinase gene. We present the in vitro characterization of cisregulatory elements controlling transcription of the myotonic dystrophy protein kinase gene in myoblasts and fibroblasts. The region 5′ to the initiating ATG contains no consensus TATA or CCAAT box. We have mapped two transcriptional start sites by primer extension.

The strongest promoter activity mapped to a 189-base pair fragment. This sequence contains a conserved GC box to which the transcription factor Sp1 binds. Reporter gene constructs containing a 2-kilobase pair first intron fragment of the myotonic dystrophy protein kinase gene enhances reporter activity up to 6-fold in the human rhabdomyosarcoma myoblast cell line TE32 but not in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts. Co-transfection of a MyoD expression vector with reporter constructs containing the first intron into 10 T1/2 fibroblasts resulted in a 10–20-fold enhancement of expression. Deletion analysis of four E-box elements within the first intron reveal that these elements contribute to enhancer activity similarly in TE32 myoblasts and 10 T1/2 fibroblasts. These data suggest that E-boxes within the myotonic dystrophy protein kinase first intron mediate interactions with upstream promoter elements to up-regulate transcription of this gene in myoblasts.

Delineation of the biological role of DMPK in these tissues will allow a greater understanding of the pathological process of DM. Accordingly, we have begun analysis of the DMPK gene forcis elements that direct its expression in various cultured cell lines. Transgenic mice containing a 15-kb human genomic DNA fragment encompassing the entire DMPK gene express the human mRNA and protein in the appropriate tissues, suggesting at least a subset of tissue-specific cis elements are contained within the transgene sequence 2M. Narang and R. G. Korneluk, submitted for publication. (21Jansen G. Groenen P.J.T.A. Bächner D. Jap P.H.K. Coerwinkel M. Oerlmans F. van den Broek W. Gohlsch B. Pette D. Plomp J.J. Molenaar P.C.

Here we attempt identification of transcriptional regulatory elements required for increased DMPK mRNA production in cultured myoblastsversus fibroblasts. A 2-kb fragment of the DMPK upstream sequence driving the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts and TE32 myoblasts indicates a ubiquitous, housekeeping-type promoter region with only minor muscle-specific regulatory activity. We also investigated various deletions of the DMPK first intron for transcriptional regulatory sequences, which may enhance expression of CAT driven by endogenous and exogenous promoters in fibroblasts and muscle cells. Results presented indicate that the DMPK gene is regulated by a low level promoter that operates in conjunction with an enhancer element in the first intron. This first intron enhancer element is responsive to MyoD, requires the presence of conserved E-boxes, and in the presence of the DMPK promoter, confers increased expression of CAT in myoblasts. Cell lines were grown in α-minimal essential medium containing penicillin and streptomycin supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 2 mm glutamine (Life Technologies, Inc.). In the case of C2C12 differentiation medium, 10% horse serum was used in place of 10% fetal bovine serum. Mammalian cells were cultured at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. Primary human foreskin fibroblasts (HFSF) were a gift from Dr. Chaim Birnboim (Ottawa Regional Cancer Center, Ottawa, Canada), C2C12 mouse muscle cells, TE32 human myoblasts (24McAllister R.M. Melnyk J. Finkelstein J.Z. Adams Jr., E.C. Gardner M.B. Cancer. 1969; 24: 520-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar), NIH 3T3 mouse fibroblasts, human HeLa cells, and C3H10T1/2 mouse fibroblasts were obtained from the ATCC. Transfections were performed with 5 μg of CsCl-purified test plasmid, 3 μg of β-galactosidase expression construct (pSVβ-gal-Promega) by the calcium phosphate co-precipitate method with a glycerol shock essentially as described (25Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 7.79-7.83Google Scholar). β-Galactosidase assays were carried out by adding 45 μl of cell extract to 155 μl of Z-buffer (60 mm Na2HPO4, 40 mmNaH2PO4, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm MgSO4, 50 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, pH 7) and 40 μl of O-nitrophenyl-β-pyranogalactoside (Sigma) (4 mg/ml in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7, 77.3 g of Na2HPO4·7H2O, 29.1 g of NaH2PO4·H2O in 500 ml of H2O) and incubating at 30 °C for 2 to 15 h. The reactions were stopped by adding 100 μl of 1 mNa2CO3 and the optical density measured at 420 nm on a spectrophotometer. CAT assays were performed essentially as described (25Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 7.79-7.83Google Scholar). A series of deletions of the DMPK 5′ region were generated by standard methods and sub-cloned into PstI or PstI/HindIII-digested promoterless pCAT-Basic vector (Promega). All 5′ region CAT deletion constructs (Fig. 4) are named according to the position of the 5′ end of the inserted sequence relative to the DMPK translation initiation codon, and all share the same 3′ termini, which is 42 bp upstream of the ATG initiation codon. Promoter/first intron combinations −722 CAT IVS, −722 CAT SVI, TK CAT IVS, and TK CAT SVI were constructed by subcloning a 2-kb EcoRI/BamHI first intron fragment into EcoRI/BamHI-digested pCAT-Basic vector downstream of the CAT gene. The −722, −940 DMPK promoter and TK promoter fragments were inserted into HindIII/PstI, HindIII/XbaI, and HindIII sites, respectively, upstream of the CAT gene. The TK promoter was generated by polymerase chain reaction amplification of the herpes simplex thymidine kinase (TK) promoter from a plasmid (4RTKCAT). To construct TK CAT, this polymerase chain reaction product was subcloned into the HindIII site upstream of the CAT gene in pCAT-Basic. IVS TK CAT and SVI TK CAT were constructed by fusing the 2-kb intron 1 fragment into thePstI site in both orientations upstream of the TK promoter in TK CAT. First intron deletions were generated by polymerase chain reaction, cloned into pCR 2.1, excised with EcoRI, and cloned into pCAT-Basic. Subsequently, TK and DMPK promoter elements were cloned into these constructions as described above. To ensure all clones were properly constructed, all plasmid DNA constructions were analyzed by restriction digest and/or DNA sequencing. Approximately 50 ng of DMPK primer 2151 (5′-TTGGACAGGCAGCACCATGGC) was end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using T4 polynucleotide kinase. Primer extension reactions were set up using 60 μg of TE32 myoblast or HFSF RNA essentially as described (25Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 7.79-7.83Google Scholar), except Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) was used in place of murine reverse transcriptase. Standards for sizing primer extension products were generated from the control sequence of the Sequenase 2 kit (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). These were synthesized according to manufacturers instructions with [γ-33P]dATP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using single-stranded M13mp18 DNA and the −40 primer provided. RNA was extracted from confluent plates of cultured mammalian cells according to Birnboim (26Birnboim H.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 1487-1497Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) and a Northern blot performed as described (27Farrell Jr., R.E. RNA Methodologies: A Laboratory Guide for Isolation and Characterization. Academic Press Inc., San Diego, CA1993: 158-173Crossref Google Scholar). A 1.2-kb XhoI DNA fragment from the 5′ end of the DMPK cDNA (pBS DMK) was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using the Redi-prime labeling system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The membrane was prehybridized at 65 °C for 2–6 h in 6 × SSC, 0.5 × Denhardt's, 0.25% SDS, and 2.5 mg of herring sperm DNA and then hybridized overnight with the probe in 4 parts prehybridization buffer, 1 part 50% dextran sulfate. Following the incubation, the membrane was washed twice for 15 min at room temperature with 2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS then twice at 50 °C for 15 min in 0.2% SSC, 0.1% SDS and then once at 65 °C in 0.1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS for 15 min. The membrane was covered with plastic wrap, exposed to film overnight at −80 °C, and developed the following day. The blot was then stripped by washing twice for 15 min in hot water and hybridized with a fragment of the phosphoglycerate kinase gene (Pgk-1) probe by performing labeling, prehybridization, hybridization, and washing steps as described above. Oligonucleotides corresponding to both strands of the DMPK GC box (nucleotides 1947–1975, Fig. 3, see below) were annealed using a thermal ramp in a Perkin-Elmer thermocylcer and end-labeled using [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), T4 kinase, and forward reaction buffer (Life Technologies, Inc.) followed by incubation for 45 min to 1 h at 37 °C. Nuclear extracts were obtained, using the procedure of Hoppe-Seyler et al. (28Hoppe-Seyler F. Butz K. Rittmüller C. von Knebel Doeberitz M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 5080Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), which were quantitated for total protein concentration using a Pierce Micro-BCA kit according to manufacturer's instructions. Nuclear extract (5 μg) was incubated with 2.5 × 104 cpm of labeled oligonucleotide, 1 μg of poly(dI·dC), 1 μl of bovine serum albumin (10 mg/ml), 2 μl of gel shift buffer (250 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 50 mm MgCl2, 340 mm KCl), and competitor for 20 min on ice. The complexes were then mixed with 2 μl of gel loading buffer (20% Ficoll 400, 0.1% bromphenol blue), and electrophoresed on a 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel at 150 V for 1.3 h. Gels were then exposed to film overnight at −80 °C. Sequences of oligonucleotides used in electrophoretic mobility shift assay and competition analysis (shown in Fig. 5) were synthesized using an ABI 394 DNA/RNA synthesizer and are as follows: thymidine kinase oligonucleotide, 5′-ATGACACAAACCCCGCCCAGCGTCTTG-3′ (29Jones K.A. Yamamoto K.R. Tjian R. Cell. 1985; 42: 559-572Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar); AP-2 oligonucleotide, 5′-AGTCCCCAGGCTCCCCAGCAG-3′ (30Mitchell P.J. Wang C. Tjian R. Cell. 1987; 50: 847-861Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar); wild type DMPK oligonucleotide, 5′-TAAGGCTGGGAGGCGGGAGGGGGGCTGG-3′; mutant DMPK oligonucleotide, 5′-TAAGGCTGGGAGGCTTGAGGGGGGCTGG-3′ (mutated nucleotides are shown in boldface italics). The focus of this study was on DMPK transcriptional regulation in muscle cells versus fibroblasts. Initially, we characterized expression of the DMPK mRNA in a number of human and mouse cell lines in an effort to identify cell lines suitable for the study of DM protein kinase gene myoblast specific cis elements. Northern blot analysis (Fig. 1) using a probe from the DMPK cDNA was performed on RNA isolated from a number of human and mouse cell lines. Relative to a Pgk-1 control, DMPK expression was strongest in TE32 myoblasts, followed by C2C12 myotubes and C2C12 myoblasts. Weak DMPK expression was observed in NIH 3T3, primary HFSF, and C3H10T1/2 cells, while the message was barely detectable in HeLa cells. Given the high expression level of DMPK mRNA in TE32 myoblasts and the lower level in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts, comparison of DMPK-reporter gene fusion construct activities between these cell lines was deemed a suitable system for identifying myoblast specific transcription control elements within the DMPK gene. Primer extension analysis of the DMPK 5′ region mapped two major transcription start sites in both myoblasts and fibroblasts, one at position −421 (Fig. 2 A) and the other at position −71 relative to the translation initiation codon (Fig. 2 B). The sequence products shown in Fig. 2 Awere electrophoresed longer to accurately size the extension products. Longer exposures of primer extension gels revealed other minor start sites, one upstream of −421 consistent with start sites reported earlier (31Mahadevan M.S. Amemiya C. Jansen G. Sabourin L. Baird S. Neville C.E. Wormskamp N. Segers S. Batzer M. Lamerdin J. de Jong P. Wieringa B. Korneluk R.G. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1993; 2: 299-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) and several between −421 and −71. The location of transcriptional start sites mapped by primer extension is shown schematically in Figs. 3 and4. The 5′ region of the DMPK gene contains several well conserved consensus binding sites for known eukaryotic transcription factors, including Sp1 (32Kadonaga J.T. Jones K.A. Tijian R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1986; 11: 20-23Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (878) Google Scholar), AP-1 (33Lee W. Mitchell P. Tjian R. Cell. 1987; 49: 741-752Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1365) Google Scholar), and AP-2 (30Mitchell P.J. Wang C. Tjian R. Cell. 1987; 50: 847-861Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3). The lack of a TATA and CCAAT box and the high GC content in this region of the DMPK gene are characteristic of housekeeping genes (35Herrick K.R. Gorin F.A. Park E.A. Tait R.C. Gene (Amst .). 1993; 126: 203-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 36Wang S.P. Robert M.F. Gibson K.M. Wanders R.J. Mitchell G.A. Genomics. 1996; 33: 99-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), growth control genes (37Ito F. Ishizaka Y. Tahira T. Yamamoto M. Miya A. Imai K. Yachi A. Takai S. Sugimura T. Nagao M. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 1201-1206PubMed Google Scholar), and some kinase gene promoters (38Clegg C.H. Haugen H.S. Boring L.F. J. Biol.

Chem. 1994; 269: 14924-14930Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Inspection of mouse and human DMPK 5′ regions show strong homology from nucleotide 1900 to the translation initiation codon (+1) (nucleotide 2170) (Fig. 3) and includes a conserved GC box upstream of the transcription start site at position −71. Homology between the human and mouse genes is also evident upstream of the transcription start site located at position −421. To identify the location of promoter elements, we constructed promoter deletion mutants of the DMPK 5′ region. A 1963-bp fragment of the DMPK 5′ region was fused to the bacterial CAT reporter gene and a series of deletion constructs from this parental plasmid were constructed (Fig. 4). To localize possible myoblast specific transcriptional control elements within this sequence, these constructs were transfected into TE32 myoblasts and NIH 3T3 mouse fibroblasts. Relative CAT activities were normalized to promoterless CAT-Basic to compare the strengths of each construct between the two cell lines (Fig. 4). Modest myoblast-specific expression of CAT was observed for constructs −1963 CAT, −537 CAT, and −403 CAT (Fig. 4); however, most deletion fragments produced similar relative CAT activities in both cell lines, suggesting that only weak myoblast-specific regulatory elements are present in this region of the DMPK gene. A 189-bp deletion fragment of DMPK 5′ sequence driving CAT exhibited the highest level of CAT expression in TE32, NIH 3T3, and several other cell lines tested, including HeLa and monkey kidney cells (data not shown). The strength of this promoter fragment was about half the strength of the phosphoglycerate kinase promoter in NIH 3T3 cells and 110 the strength of this promoter in TE32 cells (data not shown). Removal of 66 bp from −232 CAT, which includes a conserved GC box (Fig. 3), resulted in near-background CAT expression in all cell lines tested, suggesting important promoter elements reside within this sequence (Fig. 4). To investigate the possibility that Sp1 may bind this region of the DMK promoter and activate transcription, electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed using a probe to the putative Sp1 binding site. Four apparent protein-DNA complexes were observed (a–d) (Fig. 5). Extracts from several cell lines, including TE32 myoblasts, yield identical banding patterns (data not shown) consistent with the CAT assay data, suggesting that this region of DMPK 5′ sequence is part of a ubiquitous promoter element. Complex d appears to be probe as it is present in the lane containing only probe (Fig. 5, lane 1). Complex c can be competed for by wild type DMPK oligonucleotide, an oligonucleotide corresponding to a medium affinity Sp1 site (29Jones K.A. Yamamoto K.R. Tjian R. Cell. 1985; 42: 559-572Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar) from the thymidine kinase promoter (TK), an oligonucleotide corresponding to GC-rich paired AP-2 sites from the SV40 early promoter (30Mitchell P.J. Wang C. Tjian R. Cell. 1987; 50: 847-861Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar) and DMPK oligonucleotides mutated in two positions in the GC box (lanes 3–10). This suggests that complex c represents a protein binding GC-rich sequences, but not specifically to the Sp1 binding site. The binding of the protein to the DNA in complexes a and b was specific as a molar excess of both the unlabeled DMPK probe (Fig. 5,lanes 3 and 4) and TK oligonucleotide (Fig. 5,lane 5 and 6) could compete for both complexes. Furthermore, only very weak competition was observed when oligonucleotides corresponding to the GC-rich binding site of the unrelated transcription factor AP-2 were used as competitor (Fig. 5,lanes 7 and 8). In addition, the mutant DMPK oligonucleotide could only compete weakly for complexes aand b, suggesting the NIH 3T3 nuclear protein(s) are binding the GC box specifically (Fig. 5, lane 9 and 10). Also, this mutant oligonucleotide could not form complexes with NIH 3T3 nuclear extracts (data not shown). Purified Sp1 protein was able to form a complex with the DMPK oligonucleotide of identical mobility to complex a seen in lane 2 (lane 11), but not with mutant oligonucleotide (lane 12), suggesting that complex a is Sp1-bound to the DMPK oligonucleotide. Taken together, these results demonstrate that Sp1 binds specifically to a GC box located within a minimal region of the DMPK 5′ sequence, which behaves as a minimal promoter, suggesting a key role for Sp1 in the basal activity of this DMPK promoter element. Evidence of only minor increases in CAT transcription in myoblasts over fibroblasts found with control elements in the DMPK 5′ region prompted us to look within the first intron for other sequences that may increase CAT expression in myoblasts. Mouse and human DMPK sequences were aligned (Fig. 6) and complete conservation of five potential E-boxes, a C(A/T)CCC box, a BEE-1 element (40Feo S. Antona V. Barbieri G. Passantino R. Cali L.

To explore the possibility that functional muscle-specific regulatory elements are present in the first intron, a 2-kb fragment (Fig. 9 A) containing most of the first intron was cloned downstream of the CAT gene in both orientations in the presence of a 679-bp fragment of DMPK 5′ sequence (Fig. 7 A). These constructs were then transfected into TE32 and NIH 3T3 cells. Fig. 7 shows that the presence of the first intron, irrespective of orientation, in combination with DMPK 5′ sequence, can activate transcription of the CAT gene up to 6-fold in TE32 myoblasts, whereas no activation was observed in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts. This demonstrates the existence of an orientation-independent myoblast-specific transcriptional enhancing element within the first intron of the DMPK gene.Figure 9Deletion mapping of DMPK first intron enhancer.

https://openalex.org/W1985918400,"ArsA protein, the catalytic component of the plasmid-encoded anion-translocating ATPase in Escherichia coli, contains two consensus nucleotide binding domains, A1 and A2, that are connected by a flexible linker. ATP has previously been shown to cross-link to the A1 domain upon activation with UV light but not to the A2 domain. The ATP analogue, 5′-p-fluorosulfonylbenzoyladenosine (FSBA) was used to probe the nucleotide binding domains of ArsA. The covalently labeled protein was subjected to partial trypsin proteolysis, followed by Western blot analysis of the fragments with the anti-FSBA serum. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of the labeled fragment showed that FSBA binds preferentially to the C-terminal domain A2 both in the absence and the presence of antimonite. Occupancy of the two nucleotide binding sites was determined by protection from trypsin proteolysis. Trypsin cleaved the ArsA protein at Arg290 in the linker to generate a 32-kDa N-terminal and a 27-kDa C-terminal fragment. The 32-kDa fragment is compact and largely inaccessible to trypsin; however, the 27-kDa was cleaved further. Incubation with FSBA, which binds to the C-terminal domain, resulted in significant protection of the 27-kDa fragment. This fragment was not protected upon incubation with ATP alone, indicating that A2 might be unoccupied. However, upon incubation with ATP and antimonite, almost complete protection from trypsin was seen. ATP and FSBA together mimicked the effect of ATP and antimonite, implying that this fully protected conformation might be the result of both sites occupied with the nucleotide. It is proposed that the A1 site in ArsA is a high affinity ATP site, whereas the allosteric ligand antimonite is required to allow ATP binding to A2, resulting in catalytic cooperativity. Thus antimonite binding may act as a switch in regulating ATP binding to A2 and hence the ATPase activity of ArsA.

Thus antimonite binding may act as a switch in regulating ATP binding to A2 and hence the ATPase activity of ArsA. ArsA protein is the catalytic component of the plasmid-encoded anion-translocating ATPase in Escherichia coli. In conjunction with the integral membrane protein ArsB, ArsA brings about ATP-dependent efflux of oxyanions, such as antimonite (Sb(III)) and arsenite (As(III)) (1Kaur P. Adv. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 23B: 453-488Google Scholar). The purified ArsA protein shows oxyanion-stimulated ATPase activity (2Hsu C.-M. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17349-17354Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It consists of two homologous halves, the N-terminal domain A1 (residues 1–282) and the C-terminal domain A2 (residues 321–583), connected by a flexible linker (residues 283–320; 1). Each half contains one nucleotide binding site with significant homology to the consensus P-loop sequence found in most nucleotide binding proteins (3Walker J.E. Saraste M. Runswick M.J. Gay N.J. EMBO J. 1982; 1: 945-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (4234) Google Scholar). It is of interest to determine the role of multiple nucleotide binding domains in ArsA and in other ATPases involved in transport. Site-directed mutagenesis studies with ArsA indicate that both of the sites are required for function of the protein (4Karkaria C.E. Chen C.M. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7832-7836Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Kaur P. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19272-19277Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In vivo complementation studies carried out with mutants in the A1 or A2 domain (6Kaur P. Rosen B.P. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 351-357Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as well as the suppressor analysis (7Li J. Liu S. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25247-25252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) suggested that an interaction between the A1 and A2 domains might occur in trans between subunits in a homodimer of ArsA. It has been proposed earlier that it is binding of the oxyanion that brings about dimerization of the protein (8Hsu C.-M. Kaur P. Karkaria C.E. Steiner R.F. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2327-2332Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Upon UV cross-linking in the presence of [α-32P]ATP, only the A1 domain was shown to form an ATP adduct. The site of the ATP adduct lies between residues 283 and 320 of the protein (9Kaur P. Rosen B.P. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6456-6461Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), which forms a flexible linker region between the N- and C-terminal domains. ATP cross-linking studies carried out with the truncated peptides N28, N35, C35, and the in vitro reconstituted active complex of N28 and C35 also suggested that a molecule of ATP binds to the A1 nucleotide binding site; the phosphate group of this molecule interacts with the P-loop (residues 15–23), whereas the adenine ring of this same molecule binds to a region about 250 residues away, indicating that the A1 nucleotide binding pocket consists of residues far apart in the primary sequence of the protein (9Kaur P. Rosen B.P. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6456-6461Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). These experiments, however, provided no evidence for ATP binding to the C-terminal nucleotide binding domain of ArsA or its role in catalysis. To understand the role of the C-terminal domain, we investigated binding of an ATP analogue, FSBA 1The abbreviations used are: FSBA, 5′-p-fluorosulfonylbenzoyladenosine; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; Tricine,N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine; A, ATP; F, FSBA; AS, ATP plus antimonite; FS, FSBA plus antimonite; AF, ATP followed by FSBA; ASF, ATP plus antimonite followed by FSBA; FA, FSBA followed by ATP; FSA, FSBA plus antimonite followed by ATP. 1The abbreviations used are: FSBA, 5′-p-fluorosulfonylbenzoyladenosine; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; Tricine,N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine; A, ATP; F, FSBA; AS, ATP plus antimonite; FS, FSBA plus antimonite; AF, ATP followed by FSBA; ASF, ATP plus antimonite followed by FSBA; FA, FSBA followed by ATP; FSA, FSBA plus antimonite followed by ATP. to the ArsA protein. ATP analogues have the potential of providing significant insights into the workings of an ATPase, since they allow us to look at certain conformations not otherwise accessible. FSBA, which can be considered an analogue of both ATP and ADP, contains an unmodified adenosine group; however, the phosphoryl groups in FSBA are replaced by an alkylating fluorosulfonylbenzoyl group (10Colman R.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1983; 52: 67-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). It has been used to analyze nucleotide binding sites in enzymes such as pyruvate kinase (11Wyatt J.L. Colman R.F. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 1333-1342Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) and the F1-ATPase (12Bullough D.A. Allison W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 14171-14177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). FSBA has previously been shown to inhibit the ATPase activity of the ArsA protein in a specific manner (8Hsu C.-M. Kaur P. Karkaria C.E. Steiner R.F. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2327-2332Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, binding site(s) for FSBA or its mechanism of inhibition have not been characterized. This study provides evidence for preferential binding of FSBA to the A2 site in ArsA. The results suggest a role for the allosteric activator arsenite or antimonite in allowing ATP binding to A2, although FSBA, having a higher affinity for ArsA than ATP in the absence of the oxyanion, can access the A2 site in its absence. Based on the results of this study, it is proposed that the two nucleotide binding sites in ArsA have different conformations and affinity for the nucleotide. ATP binding to the A2 site occurs only in the presence of the oxyanion, and this binding acts as a switch for the catalytic mode of ArsA. The arsA gene was subcloned into the pET16b vector (Novagen Inc., Madison, WI) to create a fusion of the His6 tag at the N terminus of ArsA. The NdeI and HindIII fragment from pSU2718arsA (6Kaur P. Rosen B.P. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 351-357Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was ligated to pET16b vector similarly digested with these two enzymes. Cells containing the plasmid pET16barsA were grown to mid-log phase and induced with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. The cell lysate was prepared by a single passage through the French pressure cell at 20,000 p.s.i. The ArsA protein was purified by passing the cell lysate through a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen Inc., Chatsworth, CA) column according to the manufacturer's instructions. Purified ArsA protein (0.4 mg/ml) was incubated with different concentrations of FSBA at 37 °C for 30 min in the presence or the absence of 0.5 mm antimonite. The reaction was carried out in a 100-μl reaction volume containing 50 mm MOPS-KOH, pH 7.5. ArsA protein containing dimethyl sulfoxide (final concentration 5%, v/v) was used as a control. Where indicated, the samples were preincubated with the substrates at 37 °C for 20 min. The samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE on 10% polyacrylamide gels, followed by Western blotting with anti-FSBA serum (13Anostario M. Harrison M.L. Geahlen R.L. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 190: 60-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The Immunelite kit from Bio-Rad was used for detection of the bands on the Western blots. The 870-base pair C31 fragment starting at nucleotide 960 of thearsA gene was polymerase chain reaction-amplified using linearized pJHW101 (14Wu J. Tisa L.S. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12570-12576Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as a template. The primers used were as follows: I, 5′-CCCCCCTGATCAGGATGATATTGCCCGT-3′; II, 5′-GGGGGGAAGCTTTTACCCAGCAAGTTG-3′. These primers contained restriction sites for BclI and HindIII enzymes, respectively. The 870-base pair polymerase chain reaction-amplified fragment was digested with BclI and HindIII, purified on a low melting agarose gel, and ligated to pJHW101, which had been digested with BclI and HindIII enzymes, thus substituting the entire ars operon with the 870-base pair amplified fragment. This subcloning resulted in the fusion of codon 24 ofarsD with codon 320 of arsA behind the promoter pars. This clone has been designated pC31. E. coli TG1 cells containing pC31 plasmid were grown to mid-log phase and induced with 10 μm sodium arsenite (15Kaur P. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9698-9704Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were harvested after a further incubation of 2 h at 37 °C. The cells were lysed by a single passage through a French pressure cell at 20,000 p.s.i. The C31 peptide was renatured from the inclusion bodies (15Kaur P. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9698-9704Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Antibodies to the C31 fragment were raised in New Zealand White rabbits as described earlier (9Kaur P. Rosen B.P. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6456-6461Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Renatured N28, N35, C31, or C35 peptide of ArsA or the reconstituted complex of N28 and C35 was prepared from inclusion bodies as described earlier (15Kaur P. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9698-9704Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 0.6–0.8 mg/ml of each peptide was incubated with FSBA at 37 °C for 30 min in 100 μl of buffer containing 50 mm MOPS-KOH, pH 7.5. Where indicated, the samples were preincubated with the substrates at 37 °C for 20 min. The samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE on 12% polyacrylamide gel, followed by Western blotting with anti-FSBA serum. Purified ArsA protein (0.4 mg/ml) incubated with the indicated concentrations of FSBA at 37 °C was subjected to trypsin digestion for 60 min at room temperature. The ArsA:trypsin ratio of 1100:1 (w/w) was used. Proteolysis was terminated by the addition of a 2-fold excess of soybean trypsin inhibitor. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE using 10% polyacrylamide gel, followed by Coomassie Blue staining. FSBA-labeled fragments were detected by Western blotting using anti-FSBA serum. Protection from trypsin proteolysis in the presence of ATP (5 mm) and/or FSBA (1 mm) was studied by serial incubations of ArsA with each for 10 min at 37 °C. Where indicated, the reaction mix contained 0.5 mm antimonite. Different combinations of ATP, FSBA, and antimonite tested are indicated under “Results” and in the legend to Fig. 5. The incubations were followed by the addition of trypsin and analysis of fragments by SDS-PAGE as described above. 120 μg of total ArsA protein was labeled with 1 mm FSBA in the presence of antimonite and subjected to partial trypsin proteolysis as described above. After electrophoresis on an SDS 10% polyacrylamide gel to separate the fragments, gel slices containing the desired fragments were excised, and the CNBr cleavage was carried out in gel slices as described earlier (9Kaur P. Rosen B.P. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6456-6461Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The reaction was carried out in a 2% (w/v) solution of cyanogen bromide for 30 or 60 min at room temperature. To separate the peptides, the gel slices were applied onto a Tricine-SDS gel (16Schagger H. Jagow G.V. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10457) Google Scholar) containing 12% polyacrylamide. The cleaved fragments were visualized by Coomassie Blue staining of the gel. FSBA-labeled fragments were detected by using anti-FSBA serum. Trypsin- or CNBr-digested fragments were transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane at 50 V for 2 h. The fragments were visualized by staining the membrane briefly with 0.1% Coomassie Blue in methanol. The bands were excised and subjected to N-terminal sequencing using a Beckman model LF3000 solid phase amino acid sequencer in the core facility of the Department of Biology at the Georgia State University. FSBA has previously been shown to inhibit the ATPase activity of the ArsA protein (8Hsu C.-M. Kaur P. Karkaria C.E. Steiner R.F. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2327-2332Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Inhibition by FSBA was increased in the presence of the oxyanion antimonite. A complete protection from inhibition was seen upon preincubation with ATP and antimonite, indicating that FSBA binding is specific for the nucleotide binding site(s) of ArsA (8Hsu C.-M. Kaur P. Karkaria C.E. Steiner R.F. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2327-2332Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we characterized covalent binding of FSBA to ArsA by using polyclonal antibodies to FSBA raised in rabbits (13Anostario M. Harrison M.L. Geahlen R.L. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 190: 60-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Wild type ArsA protein was incubated with 0.5 mm or 1 mm FSBA in the presence or the absence of antimonite, and the Western blots were probed with the anti-FSBA antibody. Data in Fig. 1 show cross-reactivity of FSBA-treated ArsA with the FSBA antibody (lanes 1–8). This FSBA-reactive band is absent in control ArsA sample not treated with FSBA (lane 9). A band of faster mobility that cross-reacted nonspecifically with the antibody was seen in all the lanes, including the control (lanes 1–9). FSBA binding to ArsA was seen both in the presence (lanes 2 and 6) or the absence of antimonite (lanes 1 and 5). Preincubation with ATP resulted in a decrease in labeling with FSBA (lanes 3 and 7). Preincubation with ATP and antimonite further decreased incorporation of FSBA into ArsA (lanes 4 and 8). To determine whether FSBA inhibition results from binding to the N- or the C-terminal nucleotide binding site in ArsA, FSBA binding to the truncated N- or C-terminal peptides was investigated. Data in Fig. 2 A show that FSBA binds predominantly to the C-terminal peptide C35 (lanes 4–6). This binding was diminished upon preincubation with ATP and antimonite (lane 6). The N-terminal peptide N28 and N35 showed very faint signals with the anti-FSBA antibody (lanes 1–3 and 7–9). Upon in vitro reconstitution of the N28 and C35 peptides to yield an active complex (15Kaur P. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9698-9704Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), FSBA binding was still predominantly seen on the C35 peptide (data not shown). A C-terminal clone, C31, that starts at amino acid residue 320 of ArsA and lacks the linker region was also tested for FSBA binding. Data in Fig. 2 B (lanes 2 and 3) show that C31 was able to react with FSBA as C35 peptide (lane 1), indicating that the linker region is not involved in FSBA binding to the C-terminal domain. The linker region has previously been identified to be the site where the adenine ring of the ATP molecule bound to the A1 domain of ArsA forms an UV-activated adduct (9Kaur P. Rosen B.P. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6456-6461Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). To identify the FSBA binding site in the wild type ArsA protein, purified protein was treated with different concentrations of FSBA in the presence or the absence of antimonite, followed by partial proteolysis with trypsin. The analysis of the peptides upon SDS-PAGE, followed by Coomassie Blue staining, showed three major fragments: roughly 54, 32, and 27 kDa (Fig. 3 A). Western blot analysis of a similar gel using anti-FSBA antibodies showed that the major species that cross-reacted with the FSBA antibody was the 27-kDa fragment (Fig. 3 B). The labeling was found to be dose-dependent so that it increased with increasing concentrations of FSBA. The presence of antimonite in the reaction was seen to enhance FSBA binding to the 27-kDa fragment slightly (lanes 4, 6,8, and 10). The 32-kDa fragment showed very weak labeling although the amount of the 32-kDa fragment was significantly more than the 27-kDa fragment as seen from the Coomassie Blue-stained gel (Fig. 3 A). The origin of the 32- and 27-kDa fragments was determined by a combination of techniques. Antibodies to the N18 (residues 1–166; Ref.9Kaur P. Rosen B.P. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6456-6461Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), C31 (residues 320–583) or the C46 (residues 167–583; Ref. 9Kaur P. Rosen B.P. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6456-6461Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) peptide of ArsA were used to determine if these fragments originated from the N or the C terminus of the protein. The data in Fig. 3 C show that the 32-kDa fragment reacted with the anti-N18 (lane 3) and anti-C46 (lane 9) but not with the anti-C31 antibodies (lane 6), whereas the 27-kDa fragment reacted with the anti-C31 (lane 6) and the anti-C46 antibody (lane 9) but not the N18 antibody (lane 3). These data indicate that the 32-kDa fragment belongs to the N terminus of the protein and that it does not extend beyond the linker region, whereas the 27-kDa fragment starts after amino acid residue 166. To determine the exact start point for these fragments, the fragments were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and N-terminal amino acid sequencing was undertaken. The N-terminal analysis of the 27-kDa trypsin fragment gave the sequence 291 XXSTQPVAXP (X represents the residue that could not be definitively deciphered) indicating that the start point of the 27-kDa fragment lies within the linker region (residue 283–320) that connects the A1 and A2 halves of ArsA. Analysis of the N terminus of the 32-kDa trypsin fragment indicated that it started at the N terminus of the ArsA protein. It gave the sequence 1MQFLQNIPPY. CNBr cleavage of this fragment was carried out (Fig. 4 A, lane 3). The N-terminal amino acid sequence of an internal 12-kDa fragment (marked with an arrow) yielded the sequence177AGLEKQREQY. This CNBr fragment would extend up to residue Met282 (for a linear map of ArsA, see Fig. 6 B). Hence, the 32-kDa trypsin fragment is probably the result of a cleavage event at the C terminus of Arg290 that also produces the C-terminal 27-kDa fragment. Since FSBA bound very weakly to the 32-kDa fragment, as seen from the reaction with anti-FSBA antibody, further analysis of this fragment was not carried out.Figure 6A model showing occupancy of the two nucleotide binding sites in the ArsA protein. A, linear depiction of the A1 and A2 domains and the linker region in ArsA. The P-loop and the binding site for the adenine ring of the ATP molecule (hatched area, as determined by UV cross-linking; Ref. 9Kaur P. Rosen B.P. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6456-6461Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) in the A1 domain are shown. Similarly, the P-loop region and the FSBA binding site (hatched area) for the A2 domain are shown. The locations of amino acid residues Met176, Met282, and Arg290 are indicated. B, conformations of ArsA. The ArsA protein is shown as consisting of two domains, A1 and A2, connected by a flexible linker in the middle. This model shows four central conformations (I–IV, boxed) of ArsA based on its trypsin accessibility. Trypsin-sensitive conformations are indicated by the availability of residue Arg290 in the linker. Further, hatched lineswithin the A2 domain indicate cleavage of that domain. A completely trypsin-resistant conformation IV results when both sites are occupied by ATP. It is also the active conformation and can be achieved via conformation II or III with antimonite binding acting as a switch that regulates ATP binding to the site A2. A conformational change induced by the oxyanion precedes binding of ATP to A2, and it is shown as the dimerization of ArsA. Additional conformations, such as F, FA, AF, or FS, are attained by the addition of FSBA and/or ATP to conformations I, II, or III. ATP cannot access site A2 in the absence of the oxyanion, while the ATP analog FSBA can; hence, ATP and FSBA together result in the same trypsin-resistant conformation (AF/FA) as ATP and oxyanion (AS or IV). Occupancy of the A2 site by FSBA in conformation F or FS can be seen by protection of the 27-kDa C-terminal fragment upon binding FSBA. Complete cleavage of this domain is seen when it is unoccupied (conformations I and II). Tryp, trypsin.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To narrow down the FSBA binding site, the 27-kDa fragment was cleaved further with CNBr (Fig. 4 A, lane 5). Immunoblotting of a similar gel with the anti-FSBA antibody showed four bands that cross-reacted with the antibody (Fig. 4 B,lane 1). The top band in both lanes 1 and 2 in Fig. 4 B is the undigested 27-kDa peptide. Of the four FSBA-cross-reactive bands in lane 1, the lower three bands are about 1 kDa apart in size. All of the FSBA cross-reactive bands disappeared upon extension of the reaction time with CNBr from 30 to 60 min (Fig. 4 B, lane 2). The C-terminal domain of ArsA contains 10 methionines, eight of which occur between residues 331 and 482. The fact that the FSBA-reactive bands disappeared upon longer incubation with CNBr might indicate that the FSBA binding site lies in this region rich in methionines. The smallest two bands marked with an asterisk were subjected to N-terminal amino acid sequencing. Both of these fragments were found to start at amino acid residue 355 with the amino acid sequence for both fragments being 355GFDVHLT. Since these fragments are between 14 and 15 kDa in size, the data suggest that the FSBA binding site in the A2 domain lies between residues 355 and residue 482. Greater resolution of the A2 binding site using the anti-FSBA antibody has not been possible. To determine occupancy of the two nucleotide binding domains in ArsA, protection from proteolysis by trypsin in the presence of ATP and/or FSBA was investigated. Conditions of trypsin proteolysis defined in an earlier experiment (Fig. 3) were employed to examine the effect of occupancy of the A1 or A2 domain on protection. To decipher the role of the allosteric ligand on nucleotide binding, protection experiments were carried out in the presence or the absence of antimonite. FSBA was included in the protection experiments, since the binding site for FSBA had already been identified (Figs. 3 and 4), and it was expected that the FSBA bound form of ArsA might allow us to look at a conformation or a step in the sequence of events that it would not be otherwise possible to study in isolation. The experiment consisted of an incubation of ArsA with ATP and/or FSBA in the presence or the absence of antimonite, followed by trypsin treatment. The following combinations of ATP, FSBA, and antimonite were tested: ATP (A); FSBA (F); ATP plus antimonite (AS); FSBA plus antimonite (FS); ATP followed by FSBA (AF); ATP plus antimonite followed by FSBA (ASF); FSBA followed by ATP (FA); and FSBA plus antimonite followed by ATP (FSA). The abbreviations in parentheses are used here to discuss the effect of different conditions. The protection of the protein from proteolysis was determined by analysis of the fragments on SDS-PAGE. The data are shown in Fig. 5. The major fragments in both F and FS samples upon the addition of trypsin were 54, 32, and 27 kDa (lanes 2 and 4) as was also seen in Fig. 3 A. The 32-kDa fragment comes from the N terminus of ArsA, and the 27-kDa fragment originates from the C terminus starting at residue 291 as shown above by N-terminal amino acid sequencing. Also, the 27-kDa fragment was shown above to contain the FSBA binding site (Fig. 3 B). Interestingly, the 27-kDa fragment originating from the C terminus is seen only in F- or FS-treated samples. In the ATP-treated samples, only the N-terminal 32-kDa fragment is seen (Fig. 5, lane 16). Since the 32-kDa fragment is also seen in control samples (Fig. 5, lane 18), it appears that the N-terminal domain is very compact and is largely inaccessible to trypsin. Hence, under the proteolysis conditions used in this experiment, the most accessible trypsin cleavage site is in the linker region at Arg290, and it cleaves the protein into N and C domains. If the A2 site in the C terminus is occupied as in F or FS-treated samples, the C-terminal 27-kDa fragment is protected (Fig. 5, lanes 2 and 4). If the C-terminal site is unoccupied as in control and ATP-treated samples, the 27-kDa fragment is completely digested (Fig. 5, lanes 16 and 18). Interestingly, complete protection from trypsin was seen in FA, FSA, AF, or AS samples such that even the first cleavage at Arg290 did not occur (Fig. 5, lanes 6,8, 10, 12, and 14). A comparison of the A and AS samples versus F and FS is also very revealing. The proteolysis pattern of the A and AS samples was significantly different. The A-treated ArsA was cleaved into the 32- and 27-kDa fragments, and the 27-kDa fragment was further digested completely, but the AS sample was completely protected. By comparison, no difference between the F and FS samples was observed. Both generate 32- and 27-kDa fragments, and the 27 kDa-fragment is protected. In the present study, we characterized binding of an ATP analogue, FSBA, to the ArsA protein. FSBA has previously been shown to inhibit the ATPase activity of ArsA with a stoichiometry of 1 mol of FSBA/mol of ArsA in the absence of antimonite and 0.5 mol of FSBA/mol of ArsA in the presence of antimonite (8Hsu C.-M. Kaur P. Karkaria C.E. Steiner R.F. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2327-2332Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These studies led to the hypothesis that each monomer of ArsA has a single binding site for FSBA. In the present study, we have shown that only the A2 domain in ArsA is covalently modified with FSBA (Fig. 3), implying that the two nucleotide binding sites in ArsA have distinct conformations. It is likely that both the sites in ArsA bind FSBA; however, binding to the A1 domain may not lead to covalent incorporation as has also been shown for FSBA binding to pyruvate kinase (10Colman R.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1983; 52: 67-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The addition of FSBA to pyruvate kinase initially results in partial inactivation due to modification of a cysteine residue; however, this reaction does not lead to covalent incorporation of the label. Complete inactivation of pyruvate kinase then results from modification of a tyrosine residue at a different location (18Annamalai A.E. Colman R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 10276-10283Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The FSBA binding site in the A2 domain of ArsA is different from the previously characterized A1 site that forms an adduct with ATP in the linker region on UV cross-linking (9Kaur P. Rosen B.P. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6456-6461Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). FSBA binding to the A2 site was seen both in the presence or the absence of antimonite. Earlier studies have shown that antimonite enhances the inhibition of ArsA by FSBA (8Hsu C.-M. Kaur P. Karkaria C.E. Steiner R.F. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2327-2332Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Perhaps the role of antimonite is only to cause tighter binding of FSBA to the A2 domain in a dimer. FSBA binding to the truncated peptide C31 (A2) or C35 (linker +A2) suggests that these peptides acquire at least a partially native conformation like the N-terminal peptide N35 that also forms an independent domain capable of forming an UV-activated adduct with [α-32P]ATP (6Kaur P. Rosen B.P. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 351-357Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Kaur P. Rosen B.P. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6456-6461Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Although FSBA binding to A2 was seen in the absence of antimonite, the data presented in this paper suggest that binding of ATP to the A2 site occurs predominantly in the presence of antimonite. Trypsin protection experiments provided an invaluable tool to probe the occupancy of the two nucleotide binding sites in ArsA. A model based on the available data is shown in Fig. 6 B. The ArsA protein consists of two homologous halves, A1 and A2, which are connected by a flexible linker. The catalytic activity of ArsA is stimulated by the oxyanion antimonite or arsenite. Hence, ArsA is an allosteric protein that contains binding site(s) for the oxyanion in addition to the two nucleotide binding sites. In this model, conformations I–IV of ArsA show the temporal sequence of events leading to catalysis. Conformation IV is the active conformation and can be achieved via conformation II or III as a result of antimonite binding. These conformations are based on their trypsin accessibility and on the trypsin accessibility of additional conformations (F, FS, FA, AF) seen in the presence of FSBA. I, II, and III are trypsin-sensitive conformations, and this is indicated by the availability of residue Arg290 in the linker. Cleavage at this residue results in an N-terminal 32-kDa and a C-terminal 27-kDa fragment (Fig. 5). FSBA can be added to conformation I or III, resulting in binding of FSBA to the A2 domain (Figs. 3 and 5). This is reflected in protection of the 27-kDa fragment derived from the A2 domain in F or FS conformations. Since this fragment is not protected (hatched lines in Fig. 6 B indicate complete cleavage) in conformation II, which is achieved in the presence of ATP, it is assumed that the A2 site under these conditions is unoccupied by the nucleotide. The addition of FSBA to conformation II or the addition of ATP to conformation F results in a completely trypsin-protected conformation AF or FA. In this conformation, Arg290 in the linker is not accessible to trypsin for the initial cleavage event. Hence, FSBA and ATP can be added to the ArsA protein in any order (samples FA and AF), attaining the same final trypsin-resistant conformation. Since FSBA binds to the A2 site, it appears that in AF or FA samples, ATP and FSBA are bound to the ArsA protein simultaneously (ATP to A1 and FSBA to A2). Hence, occupancy of both sites simultaneously by the nucleotide results in a change in conformation of the linker and a completely trypsin-protected conformation. This same conformation is also seen in the presence of ATP and antimonite (AS or conformation IV). Hence, FSBA and ATP together mimic the effect of ATP and antimonite, thus suggesting the role of antimonite, which might be to induce ATP binding to the C-terminal site so that one ATP binds in the absence of antimonite (to A1) and two molecules of ATP bind in its presence (to A1 and A2). Since FSBA binds to the A2 site irrespective of the presence or the absence of antimonite, the effect of antimonite on FSBA binding is not reflected in an increase in the number of sites occupied. FSBA, having a higher affinity for ArsA than ATP in the absence of the oxyanion, can access a site in ArsA that is accessible to ATP only in the presence of antimonite. Accordingly, no difference is observed in trypsin-digested F or FS samples, whereas the difference between the trypsin-digested A and AS samples is significant (Fig. 5). ATP has previously been shown to form an UV-activated covalent adduct only to the A1 domain of ArsA (6Kaur P. Rosen B.P. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 351-357Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Kaur P. Rosen B.P. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6456-6461Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). If ATP binds to the A2 domain in the presence of antimonite, one might expect ATP to UV cross-link to the A2 domain in the presence of antimonite and to A1 in either the presence or the absence of antimonite. Although UV-activated adduct was seen to form only to the A1 domain either in the presence or in the absence of antimonite (data not shown), the absence of UV cross-linking to the A2 site does not necessarily imply the absence of ATP binding. It is possible that UV cross-linking might require certain specific residue(s) in the vicinity of the ATP binding site, and such a residue might be absent from the A2 domain. The implications of the model presented in Fig. 6 are the following. The A1 site in ArsA is a high affinity ATP site (based on the fact that the AF or FA conformation, distinct from the F conformation, can be isolated), whereas the A2 site has low affinity and binds ATP only in the presence of antimonite. Hence, antimonite binding acts as a switch that regulates the binding of ATP to A2. It is likely that antimonite does so by inducing a conformation, such as dimerization, that opens up the A2 site. When both sites are occupied by ATP, positive catalytic cooperativity results in promotion of catalysis. Asymmetry between the nucleotide binding sites and positive catalytic cooperativity resulting from occupancy of more than one site is well documented in the F1-ATPase (19Boyer P.D. FASEB J. 1989; 3: 2164-2178Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Each β-subunit in F1 at any one time has a different conformation and hence a different binding affinity for the nucleotide, but each subunit goes through the binding changes in a cyclic manner (17Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2743) Google Scholar). This asymmetry in F1 is brought about by rotation of the α-β head relative to the λ-subunit (17Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2743) Google Scholar). In ArsA, the asymmetry between the sites and the difference in affinity for ATP appears to be built into the structure, perhaps to prevent futile cycles of ATP hydrolysis. Hence, in ATPases like ArsA, a switch is essential, and the switch in ArsA may be the binding of the allosteric ligand antimonite or arsenite that allows ATP binding to the low affinity A2 site, resulting in a 10–15-fold stimulation of hydrolysis. The mechanism appears to be an “on/off” effect rather than an increase in affinity, since the effect of the oxyanion cannot be bypassed by increasing the concentration of ATP. Whether each site in ArsA is capable of unisite catalysis remains to be determined. Experiments are under way to directly test ATP binding to both nucleotide binding sites in ArsA in the presence of antimonite and to one site in its absence. Structural information on different conformations of ArsA is also expected to greatly help in achieving a better understanding of the mechanism of this ATPase.
