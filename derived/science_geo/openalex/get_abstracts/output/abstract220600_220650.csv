 Rogers and Seddon
 review recent progress on developing new ionic liquid solvents for use in chemical synthesis, catalysis, fuel cells, and other applications. Ionic liquids are considered advantageous not only because of their versatility but also for their green credentials, although it is important to remember that not all ionic liquids are environmentally benign. One industrial process has been reported, and others may not be far behind. The authors conclude that in the next decade, ionic liquids are likely to replace conventional solvents in many applications."

https://openalex.org/W2018098207,"Entanglement lies at the heart of quantum mechanics, and in recent years has been identified as an essential resource for quantum information processing and computation. The experimentally challenging production of highly entangled multi-particle states is therefore important for investigating both fundamental physics and practical applications. Here we report the creation of highly entangled states of neutral atoms trapped in the periodic potential of an optical lattice. Controlled collisions between individual neighbouring atoms are used to realize an array of quantum gates, with massively parallel operation. We observe a coherent entangling-disentangling evolution in the many-body system, depending on the phase shift acquired during the collision between neighbouring atoms. Such dynamics are indicative of highly entangled many-body states; moreover, these are formed in a single operational step, independent of the size of the system."
https://openalex.org/W1969840935,"Following the demonstration of coherent control of the quantum state of a superconducting charge qubit, a variety of qubits based on Josephson junctions have been implemented. Although such solid-state devices are not currently as advanced as microscopic qubits based on nuclear magnetic resonance and ion trap technologies, the potential scalability of the former systems--together with progress in their coherence times and read-out schemes--makes them strong candidates for the building block of a quantum computer. Recently, coherent oscillations and microwave spectroscopy of capacitively coupled superconducting qubits have been reported; the next challenging step towards quantum computation is the realization of logic gates. Here we demonstrate conditional gate operation using a pair of coupled superconducting charge qubits. Using a pulse technique, we prepare different input states and show that their amplitude can be transformed by controlled-NOT (C-NOT) gate operation, although the phase evolution during the gate operation remains to be clarified."

https://openalex.org/W2045151558,"The ubiquitin system plays an important role in endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated degradation of proteins that are misfolded, that fail to associate with their oligomerization partners, or whose levels are metabolically regulated. E3 ubiquitin ligases are key enzymes in the ubiquitination process as they recognize the substrate and facilitate coupling of multiple ubiquitin units to the protein that is to be degraded. The <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> ER-resident E3 ligase Hrd1p/Der3p functions in the metabolically regulated degradation of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase and additionally facilitates the degradation of a number of misfolded proteins from the ER. In this study we characterized the structure and function of the putative human orthologue of yeast Hrd1p/Der3p, designated human HRD1. We show that human HRD1 is a non-glycosylated, stable ER protein with a cytosolic RING-H2 finger domain. In the presence of the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UBC7, the RING-H2 finger has <i>in vitro</i> ubiquitination activity for Lys<sup>48</sup>-specific polyubiquitin linkage, suggesting that human HRD1 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase involved in protein degradation. Human HRD1 appears to be involved in the basal degradation of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase but not in the degradation that is regulated by sterols. Additionally we show that human HRD1 is involved in the elimination of two model ER-associated degradation substrates, TCR-α and CD3-δ."
https://openalex.org/W1997490378,"The proximal promoter of the C/EBPβ gene possesses dual cis regulatory elements (TGA1 and TGA2), both of which contain core CREB binding sites. Comparison of the activities of C/EBPβ promoter-reporter genes with 5′-truncations or site-directed mutations in the TGA elements showed that both are required for maximal promoter function. Electrophoretic mobility shift and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analyses with antibodies specific to CREB and ATF1 showed that these CREB family members associate with the proximal promoter both in vitro and ex vivo. Immunoblotting and ChIP analysis revealed that other CREB family members, CREM and ATF1, are up-regulated and associate with the proximal C/EBPβ promoter in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) from CREB(-/-) mice. ChIP analysis of wild-type MEFs and 3T3-L1 preadipocytes revealed that interaction of phospho-CREB, the active form of CREB, with the C/EBPβ gene promoter occurs only after induction of differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes and MEFs. Consistent with the interaction of CREB and ATF1 at the TGA regulatory elements, expression of constitutively active CREB strongly activated C/EBPβ promoter-reporter genes, induced expression of endogenous C/EBPβ, and caused adipogenesis in the absence of the hormonal inducers normally required. Conversely, expression of a dominant-negative CREB blocked promoter-reporter activity, expression of C/EBPβ, and adipogenesis. When subjected to the standard adipocyte differentiation protocol, wild-type MEFs differentiate into adipocytes at high frequency, whereas CREB(-/-) MEFs exhibit greatly reduced expression of C/EBPβ and differentiation. The low level of expression of C/EBPβ and differentiation in CREB(-/-) MEFs appears to be due to up-regulation of other CREB protein family members, i.e. ATF1 and CREM.

The increased adipose tissue mass associated with obesity results from an increase in the number and size of adipocytes (1Shepherd P.R. Gnudi L. Tozzo E. Yang H. Leach F. Kahn B.B. J. Biol.

The increase in adipocyte number is due to recruitment of preadipose cells (including preadipocytes) that populate the vascular stroma of adipose tissue (3Van R.L. Bayliss C.E. Roncari D.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1976; 58: 699-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar).

When growth-arrested 3T3-L1 preadipocytes or mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) are treated with differentiation inducers, they synchronously re-enter the cell cycle, undergo ∼2 rounds of MCE, and then acquire adipocyte characteristics. Recent evidence has shown that this process is a prerequisite for terminal adipocyte differentiation (7Tang Q.Q. Otto T.C. Lane M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 44-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar, 8Patel Y.M. Lane M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1279-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). C/EBPβ, a B-Zip transcription factor that is expressed prior to MCE, plays an essential role in this process (9Tang Q.Q. Otto T.C. Lane M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 850-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar) and in subsequent events of the differentiation program (10Tang Q.-Q. Lane M.D. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2231-2241Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar).Following MCE, C/EBPβ initiates a cascade of transcriptional activation (11Yeh W.-C. Cao Z. Classon M. McKnight S.L. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 168-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar). C/EBPβ activates expression of the C/EBPα and PPARγ genes which function together as pleiotropic transcriptional activators of the large group of genes that produce the adipocyte phenotype (6MacDougald O.A. Lane M.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 345-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (933) Google Scholar, 12Rosen E.D. Walkey C.J. Puigserver P. Spiegelman B.M.

Both of the C/EBPα and PPARγ genes possess cis-C/E BP regulatory elements in their proximal promoters at which C/EBPβ binds and coordinately activates transcription (14Christy R.J. Kaestner K.H. Geiman D.E. Lane M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2593-2597Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 15Tang Q.Q. Jiang M.S. Lane M.D. Mol. Cell.

Commun. 1997; 240: 99-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Once expressed, C/EBPα is thought to maintain expression of both the C/EBPα and PPARγ genes via transactivation mediated by their respective C/E BP regulatory elements (14Christy R.J. Kaestner K.H. Geiman D.E. Lane M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2593-2597Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 16Zhu Y. Qi C. Korenberg J.R. Chen X.N. Noya D. Rao M.S. Reddy J.K. Proc. Natl.

A. 1997; 94: 13571-13575Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), the expression of C/EBPβ declines. Presumably, this dual role facilitates maintenance of the terminally differentiated state.Several lines of evidence have implicated CREB (cAMP response element-binding protein) as a transcriptional activator in the adipocyte differentiation program. Forced expression of CREB in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes promotes differentiation as evidenced by expression of adipocyte markers and the accumulation of cytoplasmic triglyceride (20Reusch J.E. Colton L.A. Klemm D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1008-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Factors, such as methylisobutylxanthine or forskolin that increase cellular cAMP or cAMP itself (6MacDougald O.A. Lane M.D. Annu. Rev.

Hsu R.Y. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 4745-4750Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cellular target of cAMP, protein kinase A, catalyzes phosphorylation of CREB on serine 133 and thereby, its capacity to activate transcription (26Gonzalez G.A. Montminy M.R. Cell. 1989; 59: 675-680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2041) Google Scholar). Finally, there is circumstantial evidence that cAMP, acting through CREB, is responsible for the transcriptional activation of the C/EBPβ gene (27Niehof M. Manns M.P. Trautwein C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3600-3613Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).In the present investigation, we identify and characterize the roles of dual CRE-like cis regulatory elements (and their cognate trans-acting factors) in the C/EBPβ gene promoter early in the adipocyte differentiation program. We show that CREB is activated by phosphorylation and, along with ATF1, binds to the dual CRE-like elements in the proximal promoter of the C/EBPβ gene. Several lines of evidence indicate an essential role of the cis-elements and members of the CREB/ATF1 family in the adipocyte differentiation process.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture and Induction of Differentiation—The 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were maintained and propagated in DMEM containing 10% (v/v) calf serum. Two-day postconfluent (designated day 0) cells were induced to differentiate (25Student A.K. Hsu R.Y. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 4745-4750Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with DMEM containing 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 0.5 mm 1-methyl-3-isobutylxanthine (i.e. 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine), 1 μm dexamethasone, and 1 μg of insulin per milliliter (designated hereafter as MDI) until day 2. Cells were then fed DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and insulin (1 μg/ml) for 2 days after which they were fed every other day with DMEM containing 10% FBS.Preparation of Mouse Embryo Fibroblasts (MEFs)—CREB+/- females were crossed with CREB+/- males, and embryos were dissected 14.5 days after detection of vaginal plugs. After the head and internal organs were removed, embryos were minced and incubated in trypsin for 30 min at 37 °C. Dispersed cells were harvested (and saved), and fresh trypsin was added to the undispersed clumps. This step was repeated for three times until the embryo was virtually completely digested. After a low speed centrifugation, the pooled dispersed cells were resuspended in DMEM containing 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum and propagated. MEF cells were induced into differentiation using the same protocol employed for 3T3-L1 preadipocytes.Gene Constructs and Mutations—A DNA fragment containing the mouse C/EBPβ cDNA (sequence information from GenBank™) was used as a probe to screen a λ FixII mouse (BALB/cJ) genomic DNA library (provided by D. Nathans, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine). After three rounds of screening, positive clones were selected and amplified. The amplified phage DNA was subjected to restriction digestion and Southern blotting and probed with a 5′-proximal promoter fragment of mouse C/EBPβ cDNA (nucleotides -341 to +50). Positive bands of appropriate size were cloned and sequenced. The promoter sequences were then cloned into pGL3basic luciferase reporter expression vector (Promega). Serial 5′-deleted reporter constructs of the C/EBPβ promoter were constructed using nested deletion techniques (Exo Mung Bean Deletion Kit, Stratagene).TGA-site mutant constructs, e.g. MT1, MT2, and DMT, were generated by the PCR method as described previously (28Saiki R.K. Gelfand D.H. Stoffel S. Scharf S.J. Higuchi R. Horn G.T. Mullis K.B. Erlich H.A. Science. 1988; 239: 487-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (13401) Google Scholar). In TGA1, the core TGA site at -111 bp was mutated from ATGACGCG to AACTCGCG (mutated bases underlined), and in TGA2 the core TGA site at -65 bp was mutated from GTGACGCAG to GACTCGCAG. To construct DMT with mutations on both TGA sites, a unique ApaI restriction site between the two TGA sites was utilized. After double digestion with ApaI and XhoI, the DNA fragment containing the wild-type TGA2 site in construct MT1 was replaced with a mutated TGA2 fragment from construct MT2. The authenticity of the mutations was verified by sequencing.Transfection and Reporter Gene Analysis—Proliferating (∼70% confluent) 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were transiently transfected with 2 μg of promoter-reporter construct along with 8 μg of carrier DNA using the calcium phosphate precipitation method (29Hwang C.-S. Mandrup S. MacDougald O.M. Geiman D.E. Lane M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 873-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). After 2 days post-confluent (about 72 h or more after transfection) in culture, cells were treated with the MDI differentiation inducer mixture. Eight hours after induction, cells were harvested and cell extracts were prepared and assayed for luciferase activity.Immunoblotting and Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Analysis—Cell monolayers were washed with PBS, lysed in 1% SDS/60 mm Tris·Cl, pH 6.8, buffer and incubated at 100 °C for 10 min. Lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore). Nuclei were isolated from 3T3-L1 cells and nuclear extracts were prepared using 1× NUN solution (30Lavery D.J. Schibler U. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1871-1884Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar) containing 0.3 m NaCl, 1 m urea, 1% Nonidet P-40, 25 mm Hepes (pH 7.9), and 1 mm dithiothreitol. Protein concentration was determined by the Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad). For immunoblot analysis, equal amounts of protein lysates were loaded, and proteins were identified with specific antibodies. CREB antibody was from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA), anti-phospho-CREB was from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY), and anti-ATF1 was generously provided by Dr. Wolfgang Schmid (German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany). EMSA analysis was performed essentially as described (31Raymondjean M. Cereghini S. Yaniv M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 757-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 32Fried M. Crothers D.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 6506-6525Crossref Scopus (1683) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Reaction mixtures containing 0.25 ng of 32P-labeled oligonucleotide, 1 μg of poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC), and 10 μg of nuclear extract protein in 30 μl of buffer (10 mm Hepes, 0.1 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol, 100 mm NaCl, 0.3 m urea, 0.3% Nonidet P-40) were incubated at 4 °C for 15 min after which proteins were resolved in TBE (44.5 mm Tris, 44.5 mm boric acid, 1 mm EDTA at pH 8.3)/5% polyacrylamide gels (30:1 acrylamide/N,N-methylenebisacrylamide in 0.5× TBE) by electrophoresis in 0.5× TBE buffer. For competition experiments, a 20-fold excess of unlabeled competitor oligonucleotide was added to the reaction mixtures prior to addition of labeled probe. Wild-type TGA1-, TGA2-, and mutated TGA1-, TGA2-site oligonucleotides were double-stranded and contained the following sequences: TGA1 wt -117 bp, 5′-GGGCAATGACGCGCACCGACCG-3′ -96 bp; TGA1 mutant, 5′-GGGCAAACTCGCGCACCGACCG-3′; TGA2 wt -71 bp, 5′-CCAGCGTGACGCAGCCCGTTGC-3′ -50 bp; and TGA2 mutant, 5′-CCAGCGACTCGCAGCCCGTTGC-3′.Anti-CREB, -ATF1, and -ATF1/2-(which recognizes both CREB and ATF1) were used in EMSA supershift experiments. Anti-CREB was generously provided by Dr. David Ginty (Dept. of Neuroscience, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD); anti-ATF1 and anti-ATF1/2 were from Dr. Wolfgang Schmid (Division of Molecular Biology of the Cell I, German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany). The same antibodies were used for ChIP assays.Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Analysis—ChIP analyses were performed using an assay kit (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Two-day post-confluent 3T3L1 or MEF cells (one 10-cm dish) were treated with MDI for 1 h, after which cells were cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature. After washing twice with ice-cold PBS containing protease inhibitors, scraping and centrifugation, cell pellets were resuspended in SDS lysis buffer. After incubation for 10 min at 4 °C, the cell lysates were sonicated six times with each time being 25 s using a sonicator (550 Sonic Dismembrator, Fisher Scientific). After centrifugation, the supernatant was diluted in ChIP dilution buffer and then incubated overnight at 4 °C with anti-CREB, anti-ATF1, anti-ATF1/2 (which can recognize both CREB and ATF1), anti-phospho-CREB, or anti-CREM. Immune complexes were recovered by the addition of 60 μl of salmon sperm DNA/protein A-agarose-50% slurry and incubation for 2 h at 4 °C with rotation. Agarose beads were pelleted by gentle centrifugation (1000 rpm at 4 °C). The beads were sequentially washed with low and high salt buffer, LiCl buffer, and finally twice with TE (Tris, 10 mm, pH 8.0; EDTA, 1 mm) buffer. After washing, the immune complexes were eluted by incubation for 15 min at 25 °C with 200 μl of fresh elution buffer (1% SDS, 0.1 m NaHCO3). To reverse the cross-linking of DNA, 8 μl of 5 m NaCl were added and incubated for 4 h or overnight at 65 °C. After treatment with proteinase K for 1 h at 45 °C, DNA was recovered by phenol-chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. The DNA pellets were resuspended in 50 μl of TE buffer. PCR amplification was carried out for 35 cycles with 2 μl of sample DNA solution, and PCR products were separated on 2% agarose gels in 1× TBE. Two primers were used to amply the segment flanking the two TGA sites with forward primer 5′-GCCCTCTCGCGCTC-3′ and reverse primer 5′-GGCTCCGCTGCGTC-3′.Oil Red O Staining—Cell monolayers were washed three times with PBS and then fixed for 2 min with 3.7% formaldehyde. Oil red O (0.5% in isopropanol) was diluted with water (3:2), filtered through a 0.45-μm filter, and incubated with the fixed cells for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were washed with water, and the stained fat droplets in the cells were visualized by light microscopy and photographed.Ecdysone-inducible VP16-CREB and KCREB Expression System— The Ecdysone-inducible expression system was employed to prepare stably transfected 3T3-L1 preadipocytes that could be induced to express VP16-CREB, CREB-DIEDML, LacZ, or KCREB. The open reading frame for KCREB was isolated from the plasmid, pRSV-KCREB, as a HindIII-EcoRI fragment. This fragment was subjected to PCR with a 5′ primer that introduced a new HindIII site and a consensus Kozak translation initiation sequence (GCCACC) immediately upstream of the first methionine codon. The resulting PCR product was purified by electrophoresis on a 1% agarose gel and ligated into the HindIII and EcoRI sites of the plasmid, pIND. The open reading frame for VP16 (amino acids 412–490) was excised from the plasmid, pVP16 (Arthur Gutierrez-Hartman, University of Colorado Health Sciences Center, Denver, CO) as a HindIII-BamHI fragment. This fragment was also subjected to PCR to introduce a Kozak sequence immediately upstream of the translation start site and was then directly ligated to a BglIIEcoRI fragment containing the DNA binding domain (amino acids 217–327) of CREB-327 excised from the plasmid pRSET-CREB (James Hoeffler, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The chimeric VP16-CREB gene was ligated into the HindIII and EcoRI sites of pIND. As a control, we generated a chimeric gene composed of the VP16 transactivation domain linked to the (non)DNA binding domain of KCREB. The CREBDIEDML open reading frame was excised from a plasmid provided by Richard Goodman (Volum Institute) as a HindIII-XbaI fragment and ligated directly into the corresponding sites of pIND. The resulting plasmids were confirmed by restriction enzyme mapping and sequencing.Antisense Oligonucleotides and Treatments—Phosphorothioate oligonucleotides were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc. (Coralville, IA). The sequence of the antisense oligonucleotides was: CREB, 5′-GGTCATCTAGTCACCGGT-3′; ATF-1, ′-TTCCATGGTCATTTGCCT-3′; and c-Jun, 5′-TCTTTGCAGTCATAGAAC-3′. A random sequence oligonucleotide (Scrambled) with sequence 5′-GTCTGCAGTCGATCTACG-3′ was used as a control. Each antisense or control oligonucleotide was introduced into 3T3-L1 preadipocytes using lipofectin reagent (Invitrogen). Oligonucleotide-lipofectin complexes were prepared in Opti-MEM medium (Invitrogen) and placed on cells at a final concentration of 15 μg/ml lipofectin and 3 μm oligonucleotide. After 4 h, the cells were refed with conventional growth medium containing 20 μm of the individual oligonucleotides.RESULTSDual CREs in the Proximal Promoter of the C/EBPβ Gene Mediate Reporter Gene Expression Early in the Adipocyte Differentiation Program—A 300-bp cDNA probe corresponding to the 5′-untranslated region of the C/EBPβ mRNA was used to screen a mouse genomic library to obtain the 5′-flanking region of the gene (results not shown). An insert of ∼6 kb was isolated, mapped, and sequenced. Alignment with the sequence of the C/EBPβ gene from the NCBI mouse genome data base verified its location in the 5′-flanking region of the gene. A series of 5′-truncated promoter fragments (beginning at -2912 and terminating at +33 relative to the start site of transcription) were isolated and inserted into the pGL3basic luciferase reporter vector (Fig. 1A).To identify promoter sequences necessary for activation of reporter gene expression during adipogenesis, the 5′-truncated promoter-luciferase constructs were transiently transfected into 3T3-L1 preadipocytes when cells reached ∼70% confluence. Two days after achieving confluence the preadipocytes were subjected to our standard adipocyte differentiation protocol (25Student A.K. Hsu R.Y. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 4745-4750Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which involved exposure to medium containing MDI (methylisobutylxanthine, dexamethasone, and insulin). Fig. 1B illustrates the protocol for analysis of reporter gene activity. Thereafter, cells were harvested every 2 h during the early phase (0–14 h) of the differentiation program, and cell extracts were prepared for luciferase activity measurements. Maximal luciferase activity (∼10-fold greater than non-induced controls) occurred ∼8 h following induction after which activity began to decline (results not shown). As shown in Fig. 1C deletions between -2912 bp and -117 bp promoter had little effect on reporter activity. However, deletion of the region between -117 bp and -107 bp resulted in a reduction of luciferase activity of ∼50%. Further deletion of the segment between -107 bp and -50 bp virtually abolished reporter activity. These findings indicated that two regions in the proximal promoter, between -117 bp and -107 bp and between -107 bp and -50bp, were crucial for promoter-reporter activity induced by the differentiation inducers. Using the TESS (transcription element search system) to scan the promoter sequence of the C/EBPβ gene, two CRE-like elements were identified. Both elements share the same half-CRE core sequence TGACG, located at -111/-107 bp (referred to as TGA1) and at -65/-61 bp (referred to as TGA2).The importance of the two CRE-like elements for promoter activity was verified by site-directed mutagenesis. Consistent with the results of the 5′-deletion experiments, mutation of each of the core CRE consensus sequences of the TGA1 and TGA2 sites (TGA → ACT) resulted in a 50–60% reduction of promoter activity (Fig. 1D). Mutation of both sites virtually abolished promoter activity. The two CRE-like elements are located just upstream of a consensus TATA box (Fig. 1A). In the experiments described below the -117-bp construct was used as a minimal promoter-reporter.CREB and ATF1 Form Complexes with Oligonucleotides Corresponding to the TGA Promoter Elements—Electrophoretic mobility shift analyses (EMSAs) were performed with 32P-labeled TGA1 (-117/-96) and TGA2 (-71/-50) oligonucleotide probes, and nuclear extracts from 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were prepared at 0, 2, and 8 h following MDI treatment. As shown in Fig. 2A both probes produced band-shifts at all three times (Fig. 2A, lanes 1–3 and 10–12). Specificity was verified by the abolition of binding with a 20-fold excess of unlabeled CRE-consensus oligonucleotide (Fig. 2A, lanes 4–6 and 13–15). Mutations (TGA → ACT) in the core CRE-consensus sequences in TGA1 and TGA2 also blocked complex formation (Fig. 2A, lanes 7–9 and 16–18).Fig. 2Electrophoretic mobility shift and supershift analyses with wt and mutant oligonucleotides corresponding to the two C/EBPβ promoter TGA sites and nuclear extracts of 3T3-L1 cells following induction of differentiation.A, EMSA with wt and mutant TGA-site oligonucleotides.

PI serum refers to preimmune serum.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Because members of the CREB family of transcription factors are known to bind to sequences of this type, supershift experiments were conducted with antibodies directed against these family members. Co-incubation of antibody, directed against CREB with labeled TGA1 or TGA2 oligonucleotides and nuclear extracts from 3T3-L1 preadipocytes after exposure to MDI for 0, 2, and 8 h, produced supershifted bands (Fig. 2B). Although most of the protein-TGA complexes were removed/supershifted by this antibody, a significant fraction remained suggesting the presence of another TGA site-binding protein of similar size in the nuclear extract. This additional TGA-binding protein appears to be ATF1, a member of the CREB family of transcription factors. Thus, preincubation with antibody against ATF1 produced a weakly supershifted band (Fig. 2C, lanes 3 and 6), however, antibody that recognizes both CREB and ATF1 completely supershifted the band formed in the absence of specific antibody (Fig. 2C, lanes 2 and 5). Taken together, these findings indicate that both CREB and ATF1 interact with the TGA oligonucleotides and that CREB is the predominant isoform present in nuclear extracts from 3T3-L1 preadipocytes.Expression of C/EBPβ Is Correlated with Phosphorylation of CREB—The expression of CREB, ATF1, phospho-CREB, and C/EBPβ was analyzed following treatment of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes to differentiation inducers. Cell lysates, prepared at various times after treatment with MDI, were subjected to immunoblotting with antibodies against each of the three proteins (Fig. 3). CREB and ATF1 were expressed constitutively over the entire time course (up to 48 h after induction) even prior to exposure to differentiation inducers and did not correlate with the onset of expression of C/EBPβ. C/EBPβ was rapidly expressed, i.e. at 30 min, and reached a maximum between 2 and 4 h after induction. Correlated with the expression of C/EBPβ was the appearance of phospho-CREB and phospho-ATF1. Phospho-CREB and phospho-ATF1 were detected as early as 5 min after induction, remained high until 2–4 h and then declined. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments (shown below) revealed that phospho-CREB binds to the proximal"
https://openalex.org/W2090942749,"Comparison of birds and pterosaurs, the two archosaurian flyers, sheds light on adaptation to an aerial lifestyle. The neurological basis of control holds particular interest in that flight demands on sensory integration, equilibrium, and muscular coordination are acute. Here we compare the brain and vestibular apparatus in two pterosaurs based on high-resolution computed tomographic (CT) scans from which we constructed digital endocasts. Although general neural organization resembles birds, pterosaurs had smaller brains relative to body mass than do birds. This difference probably has more to do with phylogeny than flight, in that birds evolved from nonavian theropods that had already established trends for greater encephalization. Orientation of the osseous labyrinth relative to the long axis of the skull was different in these two pterosaur species, suggesting very different head postures and reflecting differing behaviours. Their enlarged semicircular canals reflect a highly refined organ of equilibrium, which is concordant with pterosaurs being visually based, aerial predators. Their enormous cerebellar floccular lobes may suggest neural integration of extensive sensory information from the wing, further enhancing eye- and neck-based reflex mechanisms for stabilizing gaze."
https://openalex.org/W2004747515,"Tetradecameric Clp protease core complexes in non-photosynthetic plastids of roots, flower petals, and in chloroplasts of leaves of Arabidopsis thaliana were purified based on native mass and isoelectric point and identified by mass spectrometry. The stoichiometry between the subunits was determined. The protease complex consisted of one to three copies of five different serine-type protease Clp proteins (ClpP1,3-6) and four non-proteolytic ClpR proteins (ClpR1-4). Three-dimensional homology modeling showed that the ClpP/R proteins fit well together in a tetradecameric complex and also indicated unique contributions for each protein. Lateral exit gates for proteolysis products are proposed. In addition, ClpS1,2, unique to land plants, tightly interacted with this core complex, with one copy of each per complex. The three-dimensional modeling show that they do fit well on the axial sites of the ClpPR cores. In contrast to plastids, plant mitochondria contained a single ∼320-kDa homo-tetradecameric ClpP2 complex, without association of ClpR or ClpS proteins. It is surprising that the Clp core composition appears identical in all three plastid types, despite the remarkable differences in plastid proteome composition. This suggests that regulation of plastid proteolysis by the Clp machinery is not through differential regulation of ClpP/R/S gene expression, but rather through substrate recognition mechanisms and regulated interaction of chaperone-like molecules (ClpS1,2 and others) to the ClpP/R core. Tetradecameric Clp protease core complexes in non-photosynthetic plastids of roots, flower petals, and in chloroplasts of leaves of Arabidopsis thaliana were purified based on native mass and isoelectric point and identified by mass spectrometry.

This suggests that regulation of plastid proteolysis by the Clp machinery is not through differential regulation of ClpP/R/S gene expression, but rather through substrate recognition mechanisms and regulated interaction of chaperone-like molecules (ClpS1,2 and others) to the ClpP/R core. Plastids are essential organelles of prokaryotic origin that are present in every plant cell and differentiate from proplastids into non-photosynthetic plastids in roots and flowers and photosynthetic plastids in leafs and stems. Plastids are responsible for synthesis of key molecules required for the architecture and functions of plant cells. To maintain a correct stoichiometry between different proteins and pathways, to remove and recycle damaged or mis-folded proteins, and to control gene expression by proteolysis of transcription or translation factors, different proteolytic systems are present in the plastid. Members of at least five protease families are present in plastids, but their structures, functions, substrates, and biological importance are poorly understood (2Adam Z. Adamska I. Nakabayashi K. Ostersetzer O. Haussuhl K. Manuell A. Zheng B. Vallon O. Rodermel S.R. Shinozaki K. Clarke A.K. Plant Physiol. 2001; 125: 1912-1918Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). A very prominent group of proteases in plants is the Clp protease family. Our latest analysis of the Arabidopsis thaliana nuclear genome indicates the presence of at least 26 Clp-related genes, with 15 genes encoding for plastid-localized proteins (3Peltier J.B.

An additional gene, ClpP1, is located on the plastid genome and is essential in tobacco (4Shikanai T. Shimizu K. Ueda K. Nishimura Y. Kuroiwa T. Hashimoto T. Plant Cell Physiol. 2001; 42: 264-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 5Kuroda H. Maliga P.

Genet. 1994; 244: 151-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Reduced expression of the ClpP1 gene in C. reinhardtii suggested that ClpP1 is involved in degradation of photosynthetic complexes (7Majeran W. Wollman F.A. Vallon O. Plant Cell. 2000; 12: 137-150PubMed Google Scholar). Transcript analysis suggested that in plants the Clp genes are constitutively expressed, with only minor altered gene expression under specific stress conditions or during senescence (8Shanklin J. DeWitt N.D. Flanagan J.M. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 1713-1722PubMed Google Scholar, 9Nakabayashi K. Ito M. Kiyosue T. Shinozaki K. Watanabe A.

Plant. 2002; 114: 92-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In the photosynthetic cyanobacterium Synechococcus, the ClpP1-3, ClpR, ClpX, and ClpC genes are essential for autotrophic growth (11Schelin J. Lindmark F. Clarke A.K. Microbiology. 2002; 148: 2255-2265Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 12Sokolenko A. Pojidaeva E. Zinchenko V. Panichkin V. Glaser V.M. Herrmann R.G. Shestakov S.V. Curr. Genet. 2002; 41: 291-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Clp proteins (for caseinolytic protease) were first identified in Escherichia coli (13Katayama-Fujimura Y. Gottesman S. Maurizi M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 4477-4485Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In E. coli, ClpP complexes were shown to be ATP-dependent serine-type proteases, consisting of a catalytic core, flanked at one or both ends by a hexamer of regulatory ClpA/X chaperone subunits, and belonging to the family of ATP-dependent HSP100 proteins (14Grimaud R. Kessel M. Beuron F. Steven A.C. Maurizi M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12476-12481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). This catalytic core is composed of two homo-heptameric rings of ClpP subunits, all encoded by a single gene. The diameter of the cavity is 50 Å, and the diameter of entrances at either end of the complex was reported as 10 Å (15Wang J. Hartling J.A. Flanagan J.M. Cell. 1997; 91: 447-456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). This suggested that only peptides and proteins in an unfolded state can enter the cavity, which is in agreement with biochemical data showing that the ATPase and ATP hydrolysis are required for the degradation of folded proteins (16Maurizi M.R. Thompson M.W. Singh S.K. Kim S.H. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 244: 314-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). However, E. coli ClpXP can accommodate 2 or 3 polypeptide chains at the same time, leading to an estimation of the opening of 20-25 Å wide (17Burton B.M. Williams T.L. Baker T.A. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 449-454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Clp complexes in bacteria can also be formed by ClpQ,Y (HslV and HsIU) proteins, which are unrelated to ClpP (18Missiakas D. Schwager F. Betton J.M. Georgopoulos C. Raina S. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6899-6909Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). No ClpQ,Y homologues has been found in any plant species. The functional role of Clp complexes in E. coli and other bacteria, such as Bacillus subtilis, involves (i) degradation of mis-folded proteins, (ii) stress responses, and (iii) gene regulation by proteolysis of transcription factors. Recognition of proteins by the Clp machinery in bacteria occurs via N- or C-terminal tags or via internal domains (see Refs. 19Herman C. Thevenet D. Bouloc P. Walker G.C. D'Ari R.

In this study, we have investigated the Clp machinery in non-photosynthetic plastids of roots and petals, in chloroplasts of leaves, as well as in mitochondria. All three plastid types were found to contain a single tetradecameric Clp protease core complex (∼325 kDa and pI ∼5.0) consisting of one to three copies of five different serine-type protease Clp proteins (ClpP1,3-6) and four non-proteolytic ClpR proteins (ClpR1-4). In addition, two chaperone-like proteins, ClpS1,2, unique to land plants, were found to interact tightly with this core complex. In contrast, mitochondria contained a single homo-tetradecameric ClpP2 complex, without association of ClpR or ClpS proteins. Large scale crystallization projects and three-dimensional homology modeling studies have shown that the structure of a protein can be predicted accurately from the x-ray crystal structure of a homologous protein. This removes the need to crystallize each protein or protein complex to know their structure (24Sanchez R. Sali A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13597-13602Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 25Baker D. Sali A. Science. 2001; 294: 93-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (1307) Google Scholar). Given the high level of sequence identity between the ClpP,R and the E. coli ClpP sequences, we decided to build models for each of the ClpP,R proteins.

The three-dimensional modeling provided suggestions for the individual contributions of the different ClpP/R proteins, as well as molecular details of the overall oligomer. ClpS1,2 models were built by threading, based on sequence identity to the N terminus of ClpA. This showed that ClpS1,2 cannot be part of this ring structure but that they likely attach to specific pockets on top (the axial site) of the core, explaining the tight interaction observed experimentally.

Plant Material and Protein Preparations—A. thaliana (Col 0) was grown under 10-h light/14-h dark cycles at 25/17 °C, and leaves were collected from mature rosettes. Flowers were collected from Brassica oleracea grown with supplemental lightning. Brassica rapa and potato tubers were purchased at local stores. Thylakoids and peripheral complexes from A. thaliana were purified according to Ref. 26Peltier J.B. Emanuelsson O. Kalume D.E. Ytterberg J. Friso G. Rudella A. Liberles D.A. Soderberg L. Roepstorff P. von Heijne G. van Wijk K.J. Plant Cell. 2002; 14: 211-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar, with minor modifications to improve thylakoid purity. Intact plastids were isolated from the various tissues by brief homogenization in grinding medium (50 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 8.0, 330 mm sorbitol) and filtered through nylon mesh. The crude plastids were then collected by a 2-min spin at 1100 × g and further purified on 40-85% Percoll cushions (Percoll in 0.6% Ficoll, 1.8% polyethylene glycol, and 0.6% bovine serum albumin) by a 10-min spin at 3750 × g and one additional wash in the grinding medium. Plastids were subsequently lysed in 10 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, 5 mm MgCl2 with a mixture of protease inhibitors under mild mechanical disruption. The stromal content was collected, concentrated, and immediately used for two-dimensional analysis. Intact potato mitochondria were purified according to Ref. 27Zabrouskov V. Knowles N.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 402: 136-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar with minor modifications. Protein Separation by Colorless Native Gels (CN-PAGE) and Native IEF—Concentrated protein samples were supplemented with aminocaproic acid, BisTris/HCl, pH 7.0, and glycerol to a final concentration of 5 and 50 mm and 20%, respectively. Samples were immediately loaded on native gradient gels (6-15% acrylamide), according to Ref. 28Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 199: 223-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (1918) Google Scholar. After separation, gel lanes were cut, and the proteins were denatured, reduced, alkylated, and run on Tricine-SDS-PAGE acrylamide gradient gels, according to Refs. 3Peltier J.B. Ytterberg J.

For native IEF, chloroplast stroma (10-15 mg) was loaded on 2.2-ml (0.1-1 m) sucrose gradients, spun for 2.5 h at 259,000 × g, and collected in 0.2-ml fractions. The fractions were concentrated and loaded on IEF tube gels with pI range of 3 to 10 or 4 to 7, principally as described previously (30O'Farrell P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 4007-4021Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Proteins were focused for 20 kV-h, subsequently solubilized, reduced, and alkylated as described earlier (3Peltier J.B. Ytterberg J. Liberles D.A. Roepstorff P. van Wijk K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16318-16327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The gels were then loaded on Tricine-SDS-PAGE gels, as described for CN-PAGE above, and proteins were separated. Protein Identification by MS and Bioinformatics—Stained protein spots were excised, washed, digested with modified trypsin, and peptides extracted automatically (ProPic and Progest, Genomic Solutions, Ann Arbor, MI), and peptides were applied to the MALDI-TOF target plates as described previously (1Peltier J.B. Friso G. Kalume D.E. Roepstorff P. Nilsson F. Adamska I. van Wijk K.J. Plant Cell. 2000; 12: 319-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 26Peltier J.B. Emanuelsson O. Kalume D.E. Ytterberg J.

Automated MS or MS/MS analyses were carried out as follows. A Voyager-DE-STR (PerSeptive Biosystems) generated the MALDI-TOF-MS spectra in reflectron mode, which were then annotated and internally calibrated. For nano-LC-ESI-MS/MS, a quadrupole-time of flight (micromass) was used. Separation of peptide mixtures was achieved by using a μ-Guard Pre-Column (LC Packings: inner diameter 300 μm, 1 mm long) followed by a PepMap C18 Reverse Phase Nano Column (LC Packings: inner diameter 180 μm, 15 cm long). Peptides were eluted by running a gradient using 95% H2O, 5% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid as solvent A and 95% acetonitrile, 5% H2O, 0.1% formic acid as solvent B, at a flow rate of 0.75 μl. The MS or MS/MS spectra were used to search the latest versions of the NCBI BLAST non-redundant data base or Arabidopsis MIPS or TIGR data bases automatically via Knexus using the search engines ProFound for MS and Sonar-MS for MS/MS data. Alternatively, MS/MS data were manually submitted to Mascot (www.matrixscience.com). Criteria for positive identification of proteins by peptide mass finger printing were at least 5 matching unique peptides (with mass accuracy <50 ppm, but typically <10 ppm), allowing no missed cleavage or modifications, and requiring at least 15% coverage of the predicted protein sequence. Criteria for nano-LC-ESI-MS/MS were at least two matching sequence tags of high quality (clear Y-ion series and several complementary B ions; manually verified). In case of identification of closely related paralogues or orthologues, it was verified that these sequences were unique. The proteome data will become available via cbsu.tc.cornell.edu/vanwijk/and as Tables 1-4 in the Supplemental Material. ClpP2:GFP Fusion and Transient Expression Assay—The ClpP2 cDNA was amplified from an A. thaliana cDNA library (CD4-7; Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center). The cDNA was then cloned as an NcoI/SpeI fragment into p1302, a pCAMBIA vector (www.cambia.org), containing an mGFP5 expression cassette driven by a CaMV35S promoter. The resulting plasmid was sequenced and used for particle bombardment of Nicotiana tabacum cv. petit havana leaves on agar plates. Leaves were bombarded twice with plasmid-coated 1.1-μm tungsten particles using a model PDS 1000/He Biolistic Particle Delivery System and were kept in the dark for 3 days before imaging. Confocal laser scanning microscopy was performed on an MRC600 attached to a Zeiss Axiovert10 and COMOS program. Images were colored and projected using the Confocal Assistant 4.02 program. Equipment and software were from Bio-Rad. Homology Modeling and Threading—Reliable pairwise alignments were obtained by BLAST. Three-dimensional models were generated by comparative protein modeling through satisfaction of spatial restraints with the program MODELLER (31Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10636) Google Scholar), minimizing the violations of distance and dihedral angle restraints from the template structure (i.e. the x-ray crystal structure of eClpP, 1TYF). The main chain atoms of the models are expected to be within 0.4 Å of the equivalent atoms in the template structure in the conserved regions. Excluding the C-terminal regions, the Cα r.m.s.d. in the ClpP,R models are expected to be on average around 1.5 Å, with 70% of the side chain positions modeled correctly (32Sali A. Potterton L. Yuan F. van Vlijmen H. Karplus M. Proteins. 1995; 23: 318-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (958) Google Scholar). The models of residues in the C-terminal part of ClpP,R proteins as well as those in the insertion loop (L1) of ClpR1,3,4 were built based on the x-ray crystal structures of structural neighbors (Protein Data Bank codes 1NZY and 1HNO) of the structure of eClpP, 1TYF. These parts of the models are expected to be within a 6-Å r.m.s.d. of the real structure. By using the threading program 3DPSSM (33Kelley L.A. MacCallum R.M. Sternberg M.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 499-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (1121) Google Scholar) and MODELLER, we built the models for ClpS1,2, respectively, based on the N-terminal domain.

The Complexity of the Clp Gene Family in A. thaliana—Our latest analysis of the sequenced A. thaliana nuclear genome indicates the presence of 26 Clp-related genes, with 19 genes predicted to encode for plastid- or mitochondrial proteins (Table I and Fig. 1A). An additional ClpP gene (P1) is located on the plastid genome. The subcellular localizations of 16 of these organellar proteins have been experimentally determined in this study and/or in earlier studies (2Adam Z. Adamska I. Nakabayashi K. Ostersetzer O.

Interestingly, a homologue is also present in the A. thaliana genome (assigned here ClpT), and sequence analysis suggests chloroplast localization (see Table I). The bacterial ClpS protein is not related to ClpS1, which we identified as part of the chloroplast ClpPR complex (3Peltier J.B. Ytterberg J. Liberles D.A. Roepstorff P. van Wijk K.J. J. Biol.

Open table in a new tab The Clp gene family can be divided into three groups of ClpP/R (proteases), ClpC/D/B/F/S/Z/X (chaperones), and ClpT (modulator). The chaperone genes are predominantly located on chromosome 5, whereas the ClpP, -R, and -T genes are mostly on chromosome 1 (Fig. 1A). Analysis of the mitochondrial and plastid chaperones (ClpC1,2/D/B3/S1,2/X1,2,3) shows conservation of a I(L)GF motif combined with an upstream basic residue (Lys/Arg), in all sequences but ClpB3 (Fig. 1B). In ClpX of E. coli, this motif is implicated in interaction with the Clp core (37Kim Y.I. Levchenko I. Fraczkowska K. Woodruff R.V. Sauer R.T. Baker T.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 230-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). This suggests that eight of nine plastid and mitochondrial chaperones might interact with Clp cores, as will be further discussed below. Nomenclature—Throughout this paper we will often refer to Clp proteins and genes from E. coli. For the sake of clarity and to save space, we will refer to all E. coli Clp proteins as eClp (e.g. eClpP, eClpA, etc). Unless otherwise specified, all other proteins are from A. thaliana. Clp Cores and Chaperones in Chloroplasts of A. thaliana—In an earlier study, we identified an ∼350-kDa Clp core complex copurified with the thylakoid by “blue native” gel electrophoresis (BN-PAGE), followed by SDS-PAGE and MS (3Peltier J.B. Ytterberg J. Liberles D.A. Roepstorff P. van Wijk K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16318-16327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Six Clp proteins (ClpP1-P6), three ClpR proteins (ClpR1-3), and a completely new protein, assigned ClpS1, were identified in this core complex. The heterogeneity of the Clp complex and the identification of a new Clp protein, ClpS1, was extremely surprising. At that time, we did not identify ClpR4 and ClpS2, both predicted to be targeted to the chloroplast. In the current study, by using native isoelectric focusing and a very “mild” native mass gel system, we identified the stromal Clp core complexes in chloroplasts, as well as non-photosynthetic plastids in roots and petals, and we reanalyzed the composition of the thylakoid-associated ClpPRS core. Fig. 2, A and B, shows the two-dimensional separation of stromal and thylakoid-associated Clp cores with “colorless native” gel electrophoresis (CN-PAGE) as the first dimension. We changed from BN-PAGE to CN-PAGE, because this resulted in greater stability of several chloroplast protein complexes. 2J.-B. Peltier and K. J. van Wijk, unpublished information. All stained protein spots were analyzed by a combination of matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight MS (MALDI-TOF MS) and nano-LC-ESI-MS/MS. The purification of Clp complexes, their gel-based separation, and MS analysis were repeated several times. The relevant MS/MS data are listed in Table 1, A and B, of the Supplemental Material, whereas complementary MALDI-TOF MS data are not shown. The criteria for positive identification are described under “Experimental Procedures.” We have indicated the Clp complex in Fig. 2, A and B, and also numbered the most abundant proteins around the Clp complex. About 95% of the Clp core was soluble in the stroma, and 5% was associated with the membrane. In both complexes, four ClpR proteins (ClpR1-4), two ClpS proteins (ClpS1,2), as well as five of six ClpP proteins (ClpP1 and ClpP3-P6) were identified by MS. Thus we now also identified ClpS2 and ClpR4 in the core complex. ClpP2 was also identified in the thylakoid-associated complex but not in the stromal complex. Further below, we demonstrate that this was because of a minor mitochondrial contamination. Protein spots in the area around the Clp complex were all identified by MS and were unrelated to the Clp machinery (Fig. 2, A and B). The ClpC chaperone was identified in the stroma as a dimeric complex of ∼200 kDa (Fig. 2C). A very large number of sequence tags generated by MS/MS were identified, matching to both the C1 and C2 protein (Table 1C, Supplemental Material). A number of tags were unique for ClpC1, and none were unique to ClpC2. Thus the dimer certainly contained ClpC1 and probably not (or very little) ClpC2. We searched for ClpD and ClpB3, and a small gel spot with ClpB3 was found in the interface of the stacking gel of the CN-PAGE dimension (above 1000 kDa) (not shown). Separation of Stromal Complexes by Sucrose Gradient Fractionation and Native Isoelectric Focusing (NIEF)—The chloroplast Clp complex always migrated on both the BN-PAGE and CN-PAGE gels as a single heteromeric complex of ∼325 kDa. However, it is still possible that the complex observed in the gels is in fact a mixture of different complexes with approximately the same mass. To elucidate this important point, stromal complexes were separated based on their native pI values, rather than native mass. If indeed Clp core complexes of different composition exist, they are likely to migrate at different pI values, because the predicted pI of the different processed ClpP,R and S subunits vary widely between 4.7 and 8.6 (Table II).Table IIProperties of the ClpP, -R, -S proteins and sequence comparisons to related proteinspIC-terminal extensionaC-terminal extension of core subunits as compared with eClpP.(Lys;Lys + Arg + His + Tyr)Sequence identityAligned/gap positionsCα r.m.s.d.bRoot mean square deviations computed using the positions of the Cα atoms after optimal superposition of these atoms on the target and template molecules.%ClpP14.9806;2743.6181/10.4ClpP25.88+2110;3553.8173/00.5ClpP35.24+5217;3453.8173/00.6ClpP44.68+4112;3049.7173/00.5ClpP55.46+128;3261.3173/00.5ClpP67.9+410;3141.9172/00.5ClpR1cThe predicted mass of the mature protein (38.2 kDa) is much larger than the apparent mass (28 kDa).8.62cThe predi"

Dynamic regulation of TJ function is fundamental to many physiological processes, and disruption of TJs drastically alters paracellular permeability and is a hallmark of many pathological states (8Madara J.L.

Many insults to epithelia such as ischemia/reperfusion, inflammation, and toxic injury lead to the loss of this barrier function (10Denker B.M. Nigam S.K. Am. J.

Previous studies demonstrated a correlation between reduction of TJs and tumor differentiation, and evidence for altered permeability of TJs in transformed epithelia has long been recognized (13Saito T.

Claudins, the recently identified integral transmembrane protein of TJs, are members of a superfamily of transmembrane proteins (3Tsukita S. Furuse M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 13-16Google Scholar, 4Anderson J.M. Van Itallie C.M. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: R922-R924Google Scholar). To date, 24 members of this family have been identified, and they encode proteins with molecular masses that range from ∼20 to 27 kDa (19Tsukita S. Furuse M. Itoh M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 285-293Google Scholar). They are predicted to have four transmembrane-spanning helices with cytoplasmic N and C termini (3Tsukita S. Furuse M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 13-16Google Scholar). Epithelia in different organs and even within the same organ differ qualitatively in their overall ability to regulate paracellular solute and ion movement, and this difference is defined by the quality and complexity of the TJs. Claudins demonstrate homo- and heterophilic interactions with other claudins (3Tsukita S. Furuse M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 13-16Google Scholar, 20Furuse M. Sasaki H. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 891-903Google Scholar) as well as with the TJ-related proteins occludin and ZO-1 through their PDZ binding domains (21Fanning A.S. Jameson B.J. Jesaitis L.A. Anderson J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29745-29753Google Scholar, 22Itoh M. Furuse M. Morita K. Kubota K. Saitou M. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1351-1363Google Scholar), and the overall ratio among claudins expressed in a particular cell type helps define the characteristics of its TJs (23Furuse M. Furuse K. Sasaki H. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 263-272Google Scholar). The epidermal growth factor (EGF) is a 53-amino acid polypeptide that regulates the proliferation and differentiation of a variety of cell types, including polarized epithelial cells (24Brown K.D. Eur. J. Gastroenterol. Hepatol. 1995; 7: 914-922Google Scholar, 25Dignass A.U. Sturm A. Eur. J. Gastroenterol. Hepatol. 2001; 13: 763-770Google Scholar). The receptor for EGF and related ligands (EGFR, HER1, ErbB1), the prototypical member of a superfamily of receptors with intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity, is widely expressed in many cell types, including cells of epithelial lineage (26Carraway III, K.L. Sweeney C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 125-130Google Scholar, 27Wells A. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 31: 637-643Google Scholar). Upon activation, the intrinsic kinase is activated, and EGFR tyrosyl-phosphorylates itself and numerous intermediary effector molecules, including closely related ErbB receptor family members, initiating myriad signaling pathways (27Wells A. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 31: 637-643Google Scholar, 28Grant S. Qiao L. Dent P. Front. Biosci. 2002; 1: 376-389Google Scholar). The integrated biological responses to EGFR signaling are pleiotropic, including mitogenesis or apoptosis, enhanced cell motility, protein secretion, and differentiation or dedifferentiation (27Wells A. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 31: 637-643Google Scholar). Homozygous deletion of EGFR is lethal, and knockout mice die as embryos or shortly after birth due to severe epithelial developmental defects (29Miettinen P.J. Berger J.E. Meneses J. Phung Y.

Although its function is still incompletely understood, it has been suggested to play an important role in the maintenance of epithelial integrity of the distal nephron, ureter, and bladder (41Hise M.K. Salmanullah M. Liu L. Drachenberg C.I. Papadimitriou J.C. Rohan R.M. Nephron. 2001; 88: 71-79Google Scholar). Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK), epithelial cells from canine renal collecting duct, have been widely used as an in vitro model to delineate mechanisms involved in the biogenesis and regulation of TJs. The present study examines the role of EGF in the regulation of TJs in MDCK II cells through selective and differential regulation of claudin subtypes. Cell Culture and Reagents—MDCK II cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing Earle's balanced salt solution supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 0.25 μg/ml amphotericin B in 5% CO2 and 95% air at 37 °C. For polarization studies, cells were grown on Transwell filters (12- or 24-mm, 0.4-μm pore size; Corning Costar, Cambridge, MA). EGF was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. Anti-claudin-1, -2, -3, and -4; anti-occludin; and anti-ZO-1 antibodies were purchased from Zymed Laboratories Inc. (South San Francisco, CA), and anti-E-cadherin and anti-β-catenin antibodies were purchased from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). The bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) staining kit was obtained from Roche Applied Science. Rhodamine X-conjugated anti-rabbit and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibodies were purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc. (West Grove, PA). Measurement of TER—MDCK cells were plated on Transwell filters at confluence (∼2 × 105 cells) and allowed to attach for 12-20 h to form a tight monolayer in normal Ca2+-containing medium. Thereafter, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and placed in serum-free culture medium for 24 h to render them quiescent. EGF (100 ng/ml) was then added to the quiescent cells and left in the medium. One Transwell chamber was left blank intentionally to determine the intrinsic resistance of the membrane. TER was measured at various time points after treatment using a Millipore electrical resistance system. Final values were obtained by subtracting the blank value, and the results are expressed as ohms/cm2. Preparation of Triton X-100-soluble and -insoluble Fractions—The method for preparation of Triton X-100-soluble and -insoluble fractions was adapted from Stuart et al. (42Stuart R.O. Sun A. Panichas M. Hebert S.C. Brenner B.M. Nigam S.K. J. Cell. Physiol. 1994; 159: 423-433Google Scholar) with modifications. In brief, cells were scraped in cell lysis buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 1% Triton X-100, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm benzamidine, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and soybean and lima bean trypsin inhibitors) and incubated at 4 °C for 20 min, followed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 20 min. The resulting supernatant was considered the Triton X-100/detergent-soluble fraction. For the insoluble fraction, the pellet from the soluble fraction was dissolved by pipetting in pellet solubilization buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 1% SDS, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm benzamidine, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and soybean and lima bean trypsin inhibitors), and the proteins were released by three sonication pulses (10 s each) at level 2. The resulting preparation was incubated at 4 °C for 20 min, followed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 20 min; the supernatant was considered the Triton X-100/detergent-insoluble fraction. Protein concentration was determined separately for both fractions using the respective lysis buffer as a blank, and equal amounts of protein were subjected to analysis. To ensure equal loading, the same immunoblot was stripped and probed for different antigens with different patterns of expression. Immunoblotting—Equal amounts of proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with the specific antibodies for different antigens. Signals were detected using an ECL detection kit (Amersham Biosciences). Following densitometry, the value obtained for protein extracted from the Triton X-100-soluble fraction in the control cells was taken as 100%, and the ratio between detergent-soluble and -insoluble fractions and changes in protein expression were determined relative to this value. When total cellular protein was used, the protein loading was normalized to actin values obtained from immunoblotting with anti-actin antibody after stripping the same membrane, and the percentage decrease/increase was determined relative to control values. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Cells plated on Transwell filters or glass coverslips were rinsed with PBS with 0.2% bovine serum albumin and fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS for 30 min on ice. For permeabilization, fixed cells were treated with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min and thereafter washed three times with PBS. After blocking in PBS containing 5% normal goat serum and 1% bovine serum albumin, the samples were incubated with primary antibodies for 1 h in a moist chamber at 37 °C. The Samples were then washed three times with PBS, followed by incubation for 30 min with the respective conjugated secondary antibody. The samples were again washed three times with PBS, embedded in glycerol/PBS-based mounting medium, and examined using a Zeiss 410 confocal microscope at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center Cell Imaging Core Resource. Image analysis was performed using the Metamorph cell imaging program (Universal Imaging Corp., Downingtown, PA). Northern Blot Analysis—Northern blot analysis was performed as described previously (43Kaushal G.P. Singh A.B. Shah S.V. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: F587-F595Google Scholar). In brief, 25 μg of total RNA isolated from control and EGF-treated cells was electrophoresed under denaturing conditions on a 1.2% agarose gel and blotted onto Immobilon N nylon membrane (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). The membrane was baked under vacuum for 1 h and hybridized with 32P-labeled full-length claudin-2 cDNA amplified from MDCK II cells under standard conditions. After washing, the membrane was subjected to autoradiography at 70 °C to detect mRNA signals. The same membrane was stripped and probed with glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase probe to ensure equal loading. BrdUrd Incorporation and Claudin Staining in Subconfluent Cells— MDCK II cells were plated at low density on glass coverslips and were left to develop into individual colonies. Thereafter, cells were serum-starved for 24 h, and EGF (100 ng/ml) was added. After 20 h of EGF treatment, BrdUrd (following the manufacturer's recommendation) was added to the cells for 2 h. Preliminary experiments indicated peak thymidine incorporation 20-24 h post-EGF treatment. 2A. B. Singh and R. C. Harris, unpublished data. Statistics—The graphic data are presented as means ± S.E. Statistical analysis was performed, when appropriate, using Student's t test. A difference of p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Exogenous EGF Increases TER—Exogenous EGF (100 ng/ml) was administered to confluent quiescent MDCK II cells plated on Transwell filters, and TER was measured at 0, 1, 4, 8, 18, and 24 h as described under “Experimental Procedures.” EGF administration resulted in a significant increase in TER beginning at 4 h after the administration of EGF, with TER reaching a maximum value (3-fold increase) 24 h following EGF treatment (Fig. 1A). The peak in TER was followed by a gradual decline starting from 30 h post-treatment; however, the values remained higher compared with those in control cells even at 48 h post-EGF treatment. To ensure that this response was dependent on EGFR activation, one group of cells was pretreated for 30 min with a specific and stable pharmacological inhibitor of EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation, PD153035 (44Pai R. Soreghan B. Szabo I.L. Pavelka M. Baatar D. Tarnawski A.S. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 289-293Google Scholar), before administration of EGF. Pretreatment of cells with PD153035 completely blocked the EGF-induced increase in TER (Fig. 1A), whereas PD153035 alone had no effect on basal TER in non-EGF-treated cells (data not shown). In addition, we tested LY294002 and wortmannin (specific phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitors), SB203580 (a specific p38 MAPK inhibitor), PD98059 (a specific ERK1/2 MAPK inhibitor), and staurosporine (a broad-range inhibitor of protein kinase C signaling pathways) to determine the possible signaling pathway(s) responsible for the EGF-induced increase in TER downstream of EGFR. Although LY294002, wortmannin, and SB203580 were without effect, PD98059 and staurosporine both blocked the EGF-induced increase in TER (Fig. 1B). EGF Down-regulates Claudin-2 Expression—MDCK II cells express claudin-1, -2, -3, and -4 (23Furuse M. Furuse K. Sasaki H. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 263-272Google Scholar). Overexpression of claudin-2 decreased TER in MDCK I cells, the high resistance clone of MDCK cells (23Furuse M. Furuse K. Sasaki H. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 263-272Google Scholar), suggesting an inhibitory effect of claudin-2 on MDCK cell TJ function. Therefore, we first determined the effect of EGF treatment on claudin-2 protein expression at 15 min and 1, 4, 8, and 18 h post-EGF treatment. EGF treatment significantly down-regulated expression of total cellular claudin-2 protein, beginning as early as 15 min after EGF treatment, and claudin-2 expression reached its nadir by 18 h post-EGF treatment (Fig. 2A). Pretreatment of cells with PD153035 prevented the EGF-induced decrease in claudin-2 expression (Fig. 2B). To investigate whether decreased claudin-2 protein expression is the result of a decrease in mRNA transcription, we performed Northern blot analysis. Quiescent cells were treated as described above, and samples were collected at 15 min and 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, and 18 h post-EGF treatment. One group of cells was pretreated with PD153035, and samples were collected at 8 h post-EGF treatment. The results indicate that EGF treatment induced a decrease in claudin-2 mRNA expression starting at 15 min post-EGF treatment, and mRNA expression reached its nadir after 3-6 h of EGF treatment (Fig. 2C). Pretreatment of cells with PD153035 also prevented this decrease in mRNA expression (Fig. 2D). To determine whether the EGF-induced decrease in claudin-2 expression is specific to the protein fraction associated with the TJs, we further analyzed the changes in expression of claudin-2 in detergent-soluble (cytosolic or loosely associated with membrane) and detergent-insoluble (representing protein incorporated in the TJs) fractions in response to EGF treatment. Under basal conditions, the majority of the claudin-2 protein was extracted in the detergent-insoluble fraction; EGF treatment resulted in significantly decreased protein expression in both detergent-soluble and -insoluble fractions beginning at 15 min post-EGF treatment without altering the relative percentages of the protein in the detergent-soluble and -insoluble fractions (Fig. 3A). This decrease in claudin-2 protein expression was persistent at 24 and 48 h post-EGF treatment (data not shown). Pretreatment of cells with PD153035 markedly prevented the EGF-induced decrease in claudin-2 protein expression in both detergent-soluble and -insoluble fractions (Fig. 3B). Immunofluorescent staining with anti-claudin-2 antibody confirmed the results from biochemical analysis and indicated predominant lateral membrane staining in control cells (Fig. 3C). The lateral membrane staining was significantly decreased after 8 h and was almost undetectable after 18 h of EGF treatment, supporting the findings from immunoblot analysis. At the same time, a punctuate pattern of cytoplasmic/perinuclear staining was observed after 18 h of EGF treatment. Because little full-length immunoreactive claudin-2 protein was present in the detergent-soluble fraction at the same time points, this cytoplasmic/perinuclear immunoreactivity may represent claudin-2 protein degradation products trafficked to subcellular organelles. Lactacysteine Pretreatment Prevents EGF-induced Claudin-2 Protein Degradation—Although Northern blot analysis showed that EGF decreased steady-state levels of claudin-2 mRNA, there was a relatively greater decrease in claudin-2 protein content in the detergent-insoluble fraction at early time points. We therefore determined whether pretreatment of the cells with an inhibitor of ubiquitination, lactacysteine (45Favit A. Grimaldi M. Nelson T.J. Alkon D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5562-5567Google Scholar), before EGF treatment would affect the EGF-induced decrease in claudin-2 protein expression. Experiments were performed as described above, except that one group of cells received lactacysteine (5 μm) for 30 min before EGF treatment, and samples were collected at 4 and 8 h post-EGF treatment. Lactacysteine pretreatment almost completely prevented the EGF-induced decrease in claudin-2 content in the detergent-insoluble fractions at 4 h post-EGF treatment and partially prevented the decrease after 8 h of EGF treatment. In contrast, lactacysteine had no effect on the EGF-induced decrease in claudin-2 protein content in the detergent-soluble fraction at the same time points (Fig. 3D). EGF Induces Intracellular Redistribution and Increases Protein Synthesis of Claudin-1—Overexpression of claudin-1 has been shown to increase TER and the number of TJ strands in MDCK II cells (46Inai T. Kobayashi J. Shibata Y. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 78: 849-855Google Scholar, 47McCarthy K. Francis S. McCormack J. Lai J. Rogers R. Skare I. Lynch R. Schneeberger E. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3387-3398Google Scholar), and bryostatin-1-induced TJ tightness in T84 epithelial cells correlates with enhanced membrane association of claudin-1 (48Yoo J. Nichols A. Mammen J. Calvo I. Song J.C. Worrell R.T. Matlin K. Matthews J.B. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: C300-C309Google Scholar). In this study, in contrast to claudin-2, EGF treatment induced significant increases in claudin-1 expression selectively in the detergent-insoluble fractions within 1 h after EGF treatment, and claudin-1 expression was 213 and 233% of the control values after 8 and 18 h of EGF treatment, respectively (Fig. 4A). Interestingly, EGF treatment also induced a simultaneous and progressive decrease in claudin-1 protein content in the detergent-soluble fraction as early as 1 h post-EGF treatment, with protein expression in this fraction reaching a nadir (65% compared with the control value) after 8 h of EGF treatment (Fig. 4A). After 18 h of EGF treatment, claudin-1 was slightly higher in the detergent-soluble fraction compared with 8-h post-EGF treatment values. This suggests that the EGF-induced increase in the membrane-specific claudin-1 protein expression is the result of both translocation of the protein from cytoplasmic fractions and increased protein synthesis. The timing of the EGF-induced increases in claudin-1 expression paralleled the EGF-induced increases in TER. Interestingly, the shift in subcellular localization and the increase in claudin-1 protein expression specific to detergent-insoluble fractions observed at 18 h post-EGF treatment remained unchanged at 48 h post-treatment (data not shown). Pretreatment of cells with PD153035 completely blunted the EGF-induced changes in claudin-1 expression (Fig. 4B). Confocal microscopic analysis indicated weak lateral membrane and intense perinuclear/nuclear staining for claudin-1 in control cells. Increased lateral membrane staining was observed after 8 h of EGF treatment, with predominant immunolocalization at the lateral membrane by 18 h (Fig. 4C). EGF Induces Increased Protein Synthesis of Claudin-3 and -4 —Overexpression of claudin-4 in MDCK II cells increases TER through selective regulation of ion flux (49Van Itallie C. Rahner C. Anderson J.M. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: 1319-1327Google Scholar). Although the functional role of claudin-3 in the regulation of TER in MDCK cells has not yet been determined, recent studies have shown that claudin-3 is expressed exclusively in the tight epithelia (50Reyes J.L. Lamas M. Martin D. Del Carmen Namorado M. Islas S. Luna J. Tauc M. González-Mariscal L. Kidney Int. 2002; 62: 476Google Scholar). Similar to claudin-1, EGF treatment also induced significant increases in claudin-3 and -4 expression selectively in the detergent-insoluble fractions within 1 h after EGF treatment, with expression increased by 184 and 263% at 8 h and by 202 and 295% at 18 h, respectively (Figs. 5A and 6A), which remained unchanged at 24 and 48 h post-EGF treatment. In contrast to claudin-1, claudin-3 and -4 protein content in the detergent-soluble fractions was decreased by only 16 and 14%, respectively, after 8 h of EGF treatment (Figs. 5 and 6A). Pretreatment of cells with PD153035 also prevented EGF-induced changes in claudin-3 and -4 expression (Figs. 5 and 6B). These two claudins demonstrated patterns of expression distinct from those of claudin-1. In control cells, claudin-3 exhibited weak but predominant lateral membrane staining, confirming the extraction of relatively higher amounts of claudin"
https://openalex.org/W1998869546,"Recently, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) ligands have been reported to increase endothelial NO, but the signaling mechanisms involved are unknown. Using troglitazone, a PPARγ ligand known as an antidiabetic compound, we investigated the molecular mechanism of its effect on NO production in bovine aortic endothelial cells. Troglitazone increased endothelial NO production in a dose- and time-dependent manner with no alteration in endothelial nitric-oxide synthase (eNOS) expression. The maximal increase (∼3.1-fold) was achieved with 20 μm troglitazone treatment for 12 h, and this increase was accompanied by increases in the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its receptor, KDR/Flk-1, and in Akt phosphorylation. Analysis with antibodies specific for each phosphorylated site demonstrated that troglitazone (20 μm treatment for 12 h) significantly increased both the phosphorylation of Ser1179 of eNOS (eNOS-Ser1179) and the dephosphorylation of eNOS-Ser116 but did not alter eNOS-Thr497 phosphorylation. Treatment with anti-VEGF antibody to scavenge the increased VEGF induced by troglitazone partially inhibited troglitazone-stimulated NO production. This was accompanied by the attenuation of troglitazone-stimulated increases in the phosphorylation of Akt and eNOS-Ser1179 with no alteration in eNOS-Ser116 dephosphorylation. We also found that bisphenol A diglycidyl ether, a PPARγ antagonist, partially inhibited troglitazone-stimulated NO production with a concomitant reduction in VEGF-KDR/Flk-1-Akt-mediated eNOS-Ser1179 phosphorylation but with no alteration in eNOS-Ser116 dephosphorylation induced by troglitazone. Taken together, our results demonstrate that prolonged treatment with troglitazone increases endothelial NO production by at least two independent signaling pathways: PPARγ-dependent, VEGF-KDR/Flk-1-Akt-mediated eNOS-Ser1179 phosphorylation and PPARγ-independent, eNOS-Ser116 dephosphorylation.

Med. 1998; 338: 861-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). However, it was later withdrawn from the market because of fatal hepatic injury (3.Watkins P.B. Whitcomb R.W. N. Engl. J. Med. 1998; 338: 916-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). The effects of this drug are known to be mediated, in part, through its binding to peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) (4.Spiegelman B.M. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 507-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (1640) Google Scholar), a member of the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily. Because people with type 2 DM often have at least one cardiovascular disease risk factor (5.Bonora E. Muggeo M. Diabetologia. 2001; 44: 2107-2114Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar), troglitazone is likely to be implicated in the pathophysiology of both cardiovascular disease and DM. Troglitazone has been reported to lower blood pressure (6.Ogihara T. Rakugi H. Ikegami H. Mikami H. Masuo K. Am. J. Hypertens. 1995; 8: 316-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar), increase insulin sensitivity, and correct hyperinsulinemia (7.Iwamoto Y. Kosaka K. Kuzuya T. Akanuma Y. Shigeta Y. Kaneko T.

Peuler J.D. Hypertension. 1994; 24: 170-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Recently, troglitazone has also been reported to inhibit microvascular endothelial cell proliferation (11.de Dios S.T. Hannan K.M. Dilley R.J. Hill M.A. Little P.J. J. Diabetes Compl. 2001; 15: 120-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Endothelial nitric-oxide synthase (eNOS) is an enzyme essential to the maintenance of cardiovascular integrity by producing NO in vivo, a key molecule with multiple functions, including vasodilation, and many antiatherogenic properties (12.van Haperen R. de Waard M. van Deel E.

Therefore, the dysregulation of eNOS is thought to contribute to the pathogenesis of certain vascular diseases, such as atherosclerosis and hypertension (13.Perrault L.P. Malo O. Bidouard J.P.

Heart Lung Transplant. 2003; 22: 439-451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). eNOS is regulated not only at the level of expression (14.Hattori M.A. Kato Y. Fujihara N.

Recently, specific sites of phosphorylation have been identified; among these sites, Ser1179 (eNOS-Ser1179; bovine sequence) and eNOS-Thr497 are the most studied. The phosphorylation of eNOS-Ser1179 reduces the Ca2+-calmodulin dependence of the enzyme (20.Chen Z.P. Mitchelhill K.I. Michell B.J. Stapleton D. Rodriguez-Crespo I. Witters L.A. Power D.A.

Roman L.J. Sessa W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6123-6128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar), thereby increasing NO production (22.Dimmeler S. Fleming I.

In contrast, the phosphorylation of eNOS-Thr497 decreases eNOS activity by increasing Ca2+-calmodulin dependence (20.Chen Z.P. Mitchelhill K.I. Michell B.J. Stapleton D. Rodriguez-Crespo I.

Phosphatases such as protein phosphatase 1 and protein phosphatase 2B increase the dephosphorylation of eNOS-Thr497, resulting in an increase in NO production (19.Harris M.B. Ju H. Venema V.J.

Another phosphorylation site, eNOS-Ser116, has also been reported, and its dephosphorylation by protein phosphatase 2B increases eNOS activity (30.Kou R. Greif D. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29669-29673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Recently, two other sites, eNOS-Ser635 and eNOS-Ser617, were also identified as phosphorylation targets of protein kinase A and Akt, respectively (31.Michell B.J. Harris M.B. Chen Z.P. Ju H.

However, the roles of these protein kinases and phosphatases as signaling molecules for eNOS phosphorylation and dephosphorylation at several potential sites are dependent on the experimental conditions used, such as the presence of agonists, the endothelial cell type, and treatment time. For example, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) (32.Gelinas D.S. Bernatchez P.N. Rollin S. Bazan N.G. Sirois M.G. Br. J.

Hwang J. Sykes M. Michell B.J. Kemp B.E. Lum H. Jo H. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: H1819-H1828Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). In contrast to VEGF and shear stress, which cause no dephosphorylation of eNOS-Thr497, 8-bromo-cAMP rapidly dephosphorylates eNOS-Thr497. All of these findings suggest that the activity of eNOS in cells may be controlled through a coordinated regulation of, and interaction between, several protein kinases and phosphatases. Most studies of troglitazone have focused on the inhibition of cytokine-induced NO production via a decrease in the expression of inducible nitric-oxide synthase (iNOS) in adipocytes (34.Dobashi K. Asayama K. Nakane T. Kodera K. Hayashibe H. Nakazawa S. Life Sci. 2000; 67: 2093-2101Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and VSMC (35.Ikeda U. Shimpo M. Murakami Y. Shimada K. Hypertension. 2000; 35: 1232-1236Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). However, troglitazone is also reported to increase in vivo forearm blood flow (36.Fujishima S. Ohya Y. Nakamura Y. Onaka U. Abe I. Fujishima M. Am. J. Hypertens. 1998; 11: 1134-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the PPARγ ligands 15-deoxy-Δ12,14-prostaglandin J2 (15d-PGJ2) and ciglitazone were recently shown to increase endothelial NO production (37.Calnek D.S. Mazzella L. Roser S. Roman J. Hart C.M. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2003; 23: 52-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). However, no detailed mechanism underlying this increase has yet been reported. Together with the previous observation that TZDs in vivo increased the expression of VEGF, a well known agonist for endothelial NO production (38.Baba T. Shimada K. Neugebauer S. Yamada D. Hashimoto S. Watanabe T. Diabetes Care. 2001; 24: 953-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), these results prompted us to characterize the molecular mechanism underlying the troglitazone-stimulated increase in endothelial NO production. Our current data demonstrate, for the first time, that troglitazone increases NO production by at least two independent signaling pathways: PPARγ-dependent, VEGF-KDR/Flk-1-Akt-mediated eNOS-Ser1179 phosphorylation and PPARγ-independent, eNOS-Ser116 dephosphorylation. Materials—Troglitazone was obtained as a gift from Sankyo Co. (Tokyo, Japan), and bisphenol A diglycidyl ether (BADGE) was obtained from Sigma. Antibodies against eNOS and Akt were purchased from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY) and New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA), respectively. Antibodies against VEGF and KDR/Flk-1 were purchased from Sigma and Santa Cruz Biotechnology (La Jolla, CA), respectively. Antibodies against Akt phosphorylated at Ser473 (p-Akt-Ser473) and p-eNOS-Ser1179 were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA), and those against p-eNOS-Thr497 and p-eNOS-Ser116 were from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Trizol reagent for RNA extraction and SuperScript™ II RNase H– reverse transcriptase were obtained from Invitrogen. Recombinant Taq (rTaq) DNA polymerase was purchased from TaKaRa Biomedicals (Shiga, Japan), and collagenase (type 2) was purchased from Worthington Biochemical Corporation (Freehold, NJ). Minimal essential medium, Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline, newborn calf serum, penicillin and streptomycin antibiotics, l-glutamine, trypsin-EDTA solution, and plasticware for cell culture were purchased from Invitrogen. All other chemicals were of the purest analytical grade. Cell Culture and Drug Treatments—Bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC) were isolated exactly as described previously (39.Kim H.P. Lee J.Y. Jeong J.K. Bae S.W. Lee H.K. Jo I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 263: 257-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar) and maintained in minimal essential medium supplemented with 5% newborn calf serum at 37 °C under 5% CO2 in air. The endothelial cells were confirmed by their typical cobblestone configuration when viewed by light microscopy and by a positive indirect immunofluorescence test for von Willebrand factor VIII. The cells between passages 5 and 9 were used for all experiments. When BAEC were grown to confluence, the cells were further maintained for the indicated times in minimal essential medium supplemented with 0.5% newborn calf serum containing various concentrations of troglitazone. In some experiments, the cells were co-treated with either anti-VEGF antibody (200 μg/ml) or BADGE (5 μm). RNA Extraction and Semi-quantitative Reverse Transcription-PCR— After treatment with troglitazone for the indicated times, the culture medium was removed, and total cellular RNA was isolated with Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. A reverse transcription reaction was performed with 2 μg of total RNA in a final volume of 40 μl using 20 pmol of oligo(dT)15 in the presence of 200 units of SuperScript™ II RNase H– reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). Subsequent PCR amplification of cDNA encoding VEGF was carried out in a total volume of 20 μl containing 0.5 units of rTaqDNA polymerase and 10 pmol of each primer. Primer pairs for PCR were as follows (40.Kang M.A. Kim K.Y. Seol J.Y. Kim K.C. Nam M.J. J. Gene Med. 2000; 2: 289-296Crossref PubMed Google Scholar): for VEGF (475 bp), forward 5′-ACGACAGAAGGGGAGCAGAAAG-3′, reverse 5′-GGAACGTTGCGCTCAGACACA-3′. Amplification of cDNA encoding glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (494 bp) was performed for semi-quantitative normalization using the following primers: forward, 5′-ACCACAGTCCATGCCATCAC-3′, and reverse, 5′-TCCACCACCCTGTTGCTGTA-3′. The amplified fragments were separated on a 2% agarose gel containing ethidium bromide and visualized with an image analyzing device (Vilber Lourmat, France) under UV illumination. The bands on the images were quantitated with the image analyzing software, ImageJ (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Washington, D. C.). Western Blot Analysis—For Western blot analysis, the cells treated with troglitazone in the absence or presence of various chemicals were washed with ice-cold Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4) containing 1× Protease Inhibitor Mixture™ (Roche Applied Science). The protein concentrations were determined with the BCA protein assay kit (Sigma). Equal quantities of protein (30 μg) were separated on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel under reducing conditions and then electrophoretically transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. The blots were then probed with the appropriate antibody directed against VEGF (1:500), KDR/Flk-1 (1:1000), Akt (1:4000), eNOS (1:4000), p-Akt-Ser473 (1:4000), p-eNOS-Ser1179 (1:1000), p-eNOS-Thr497 (1:2000), or p-eNOS-Ser116 (1: 4000), followed by the corresponding secondary antibody and finally developed using ECL reagents (Amersham Biosciences). Measurement of NO Release—NO production by BAEC was measured as nitrite (a stable metabolite of NO) concentration in cell culture supernatants, as described in many previous studies (41.Moon J. Yoon S. Kim E. Shin C. Jo S.A. Jo I. Thromb. Res. 2002; 107: 129-134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), with minor modifications. Briefly, after cells were treated with troglitazone for the indicated times in the absence or presence of various chemicals, the culture medium was changed to Kreb's solution (pH 7.4; 1.5 ml/60-mm dish), which contained 118 mm NaCl, 4.6 mm KCl, 27.2 mm NaHCO3, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, and 11.1 mm glucose, and was equilibrated for 1 h at 37 °C. At the end of the incubation, 200 μl of each supernatant (in Kreb's solution) was carefully transferred into a 96-well plate, with the subsequent addition of 100 μl of Griess reagent (50 μl of 1% sulfanilamide containing 5% phosphoric acid and 50 μl of 0.1% N-(1-naphthyl)ethylenediamine). After color development at room temperature for 10 min, the absorbance was measured on a microplate reader at a wavelength of 520 nm. Each sample was assayed in triplicate wells. A calibration curve was plotted using known amounts of sodium nitrate solution. With this protocol, the measured values represent the amounts of NO produced by the cells during the 1-h incubation in Kreb's solution, following troglitazone treatment of a specified duration in the absence or presence of various chemicals. Therefore, subsequent NO production was solely dependent on eNOS activity at the end of these treatments. Statistical Analysis—All results are expressed as the means ± standard deviation (S.D.), with n indicating the number of experiments. Statistical significance was determined by Student's t test for two points. All differences were considered significant at a p value of < 0.05. Troglitazone Increases NO Production in BAEC with No Alteration in eNOS Expression—Troglitazone increased NO production by BAEC in a dose- and time-dependent manner, as shown in Fig. 1. The maximal increase in NO levels (3.1 ± 0.42-fold of the control) was observed with 20 μm troglitazone treatment for 12 h. Longer incubation (24 h) of cells with 20 μm troglitazone caused no further increase. Therefore, all of the subsequent experiments were performed using these conditions. Western blot analysis revealed that the troglitazone-stimulated increase in NO production did not result from an increase in eNOS protein expression (Fig. 1B), suggesting that classical intracellular genomic activity is not responsible for the observed effect. Troglitazone Increases NO Production by Up-regulating the Expression of VEGF and Its Receptor, KDR/Flk-1—Because troglitazone has been previously reported to increase the in vivo and in vitro expression of VEGF (42.Emoto M. Anno T. Sato Y. Tanabe K. Okuya S. Tanizawa Y. Matsutani A. Oka Y. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 1166-1170Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), a well known agonist of NO production in endothelial cells, we next tested whether this troglitazone-stimulated NO increase is mediated by the up-regulation of VEGF. Troglitazone increased the expression of VEGF mRNA in a dose- and time-dependent manner, as shown in Fig. 2 (A and B). The maximal increase (6.23 ± 1.33-fold of the control) was observed with 20 μm troglitazone treatment for 24 h, although a significant increase (4.12 ± 0.53-fold of the control) was also found with the 12-h treatment. In concert with the increase in VEGF mRNA levels, troglitazone also increased VEGF protein expression in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2C). The maximal increase (3.73 ± 1.09-fold of the control) was observed with 20 μm troglitazone treatment for 12 h. A similar dose response was also apparent in the troglitazone-stimulated increase in the expression of the VEGF receptor, KDR/Flk-1 (Fig. 2C), peaking at 20 μm. To determine whether these increases in VEGF and KDR/Flk-1 expression mediate troglitazone-stimulated NO production in BAEC, we used anti-VEGF antibody to scavenge the increased VEGF induced by troglitazone. Anti-VEGF antibody partially (∼40%), but significantly, reduced troglitazone-stimulated NO production, as shown in Fig. 2D, suggesting that troglitazone-stimulated NO production in BAEC may be mediated, at least in part, by the VEGF–KDR/Flk-1 signaling pathway. Troglitazone Increases NO Production in BAEC by Increasing Either eNOS-Ser1179 Phosphorylation or eNOS-Ser116 Dephosphorylation—Because phosphorylation of eNOS-Ser1179 is a major mechanism for VEGF-mediated increase in NO production (43.He H. Venema V.J. Gu X. Venema R.C. Marrero M.B. Caldwell R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25130-25135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar, 44.Hood J.D. Meininger C.J. Ziche M. Granger H.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: H1054-H1058PubMed Google Scholar), we examined whether troglitazone increases NO production by the stimulation of the phosphorylation of this residue. Troglitazone (20 μm) increased eNOS-Ser1179 phosphorylation in a time-dependent manner, as shown in Fig. 3, suggesting a potential role for troglitazone in eNOS-Ser1179 phosphorylation. The maximal increase (2.4 ± 0.53-fold of the control) was observed with the 12-h treatment. With longer incubation (24 h) of the cells with troglitazone, however, a slight but significant attenuation was observed (1.8 ± 0.17-fold of the control). Furthermore, using antibodies specific to p-eNOS-Thr497 and p-eNOS-Ser116, we also observed that troglitazone significantly stimulated the dephosphorylation of eNOS-Ser116 in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 3), whereas the phosphorylation levels of eNOS-Thr497 were not altered by troglitazone treatment for up to 12 h. It should be noted that eNOS-Ser116 dephosphorylation by troglitazone occurred at an earlier time point (6 h) than eNOS-Ser1179 phosphorylation and that a slight but significant increase in the phosphorylation of eNOS-Thr497 was also observed with longer exposure (24 h). Our current results, together with previous findings of a positive role for both eNOS-Ser1179 phosphorylation and eNOS-Ser116 dephosphorylation in increasing NO production (30.Kou R. Greif D. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29669-29673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 32.Gelinas D.S. Bernatchez P.N. Rollin S. Bazan N.G. Sirois M.G. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2002; 137: 1021-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), indicate that troglitazone-dependent coordinated changes in the phosphorylation levels of eNOS at these two different residues are primarily involved in the troglitazone-stimulated NO increase in BAEC. Troglitazone-induced Increases in eNOS-Ser1179 Phosphorylation and eNOS-Ser116 Dephosphorylation Are Mediated by at Least Two Separate Signaling Pathways—We examined whether either the phosphorylation or dephosphorylation of eNOS at the Ser1179 or Ser116 residues, respectively, is the consequence of a troglitazone-stimulated VEGF–KDR/Flk-1-mediated signaling pathway. Co-treatment with anti-VEGF antibody and troglitazone significantly reversed the eNOS-Ser1179 phosphorylation induced by troglitazone, whereas no alteration in the phosphorylation levels of either eNOS-Thr497 or eNOS-Ser116 was observed, as shown in Fig. 4 (A–C). Furthermore, anti-VEGF antibody also completely reversed the troglitazone-stimulated increase in the phosphorylation of Akt, an intermediate signaling molecule that mediates VEGF-eNOS-Ser1179 phosphorylation (Fig. 4D). Troglitazone also stimulated Akt phosphorylation in a time-dependent manner, showing a very similar pattern to the phosphorylation of eNOS-Ser1179 induced by troglitazone (data not shown). These results, together with the finding that anti-VEGF antibody partially attenuates troglitazone-stimulated NO increase (Fig. 2D), suggest that troglitazone increased NO production in BAEC in part by increasing VEGF-KDR/Flk-1-Akt-mediated eNOS-Ser1179 phosphorylation. In contrast, because anti-VEGF antibody did not alter the level of phosphorylation of eNOS-Ser116 (Fig. 4C) and eNOS-Ser116 dephosphorylation has a potential role in the troglitazone-stimulated increase in NO production, we hypothesize that the VEGF-KDR/Flk-1-Akt-mediated pathway is not an upstream signaling pathway for eNOS-Ser116 dephosphorylation. This hypothesis was further examined using BADGE, a PPARγ antagonist (45.Wright H.M. Clish C.B. Mikami T. Hauser S. Yanagi K. Hiramatsu R. Serhan C.N. Spiegelman B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1873-1877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar, 46.Zander T. Kraus J.A. Grommes C. Schlegel U. Feinstein D. Klockgether T. Landreth G. Koenigsknecht J. Heneka M.T. J. Neurochem. 2002; 81: 1052-1060Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). BADGE (5 μm) partially (∼40%) attenuated the troglitazone-stimulated increase in NO production, as shown in Fig. 5A. Furthermore, BADGE completely blocked KDR/Flk-1 expression stimulated by troglitazone (Fig. 5B). Like anti-VEGF antibody, BADGE significantly attenuated the phosphorylation of Akt and eNOS-Ser1179 induced by troglitazone but not the phosphorylation of eNOS-Thr497 and eNOS-Ser116 (Fig. 5, C–F).

In this study, we investigated the induction of cellular responses by different expression levels of oncogenic ras in primary human fibroblasts. We found that a moderate, severalfold increase in ras expression promoted cell growth. Further elevation of ras expression initially enhanced proliferation but eventually induced p16INK4A expression and senescence. The induction of these opposing cellular responses by ras signals of different intensity was achieved through differential activation of the MAPK pathways that mediated these responses. Whereas moderate ras activities only stimulated the mitogenic MEK-ERK pathway, high intensity ras signals induced MEK and ERK to higher levels, leading to stimulation of the MKK3/6-p38 pathway, which had been shown previously to act downstream of Ras-MEK to trigger the senescence response. Thus, these studies have revealed a mechanism for the differential effects of ras on cell proliferation. Furthermore, moderate ras activity mediated transformation in cooperation with E6E7 and hTERT, suggesting that a moderate intensity ras signal can provide sufficient oncogenic activities for tumorigenesis. This result also implies that the ability of ras to promote proliferation and oncogenic transformation can be uncoupled with that to induce senescence in cell culture and that the development of tumors with relatively low ras activities may not need to acquire genetic alterations that bypass premature senescence.

This result also implies that the ability of ras to promote proliferation and oncogenic transformation can be uncoupled with that to induce senescence in cell culture and that the development of tumors with relatively low ras activities may not need to acquire genetic alterations that bypass premature senescence. Neoplastic transformation is caused by multiple and successive genetic alterations (1.Hanahan D. Weinberg R.A. Cell. 2000; 100: 57-70Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22406) Google Scholar), among which the oncogenic activation of ras genes seems to be one of the critical steps. The ras proto-oncogenes encode a family of small GTP-binding proteins that transduce mitogenic signals from the cell surface. Amplification of the ras genes and constitutively active ras mutant alleles has been frequently found in a wide variety of tumors (2.Bos J.L. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 4682-4689PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that the growth signals elicited by ras are crucial for tumorigenesis. Whereas wild-type ras transduces mitogenic signals in response to extracellular stimuli, activated ras provides cells with constitutive growth signals. The key role of activated ras in promoting oncogenic transformation has been established by numerous studies. In both in vitro cell culture systems and animal models, activated ras genes can cooperate with other oncogenic genetic alterations to lead to transformation (3.Weinberg R.A.

Trends Genet. 1993; 9: 138-141Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1509) Google Scholar). In addition, ras genes have been found to be activated in a variety of carcinogen-induced tumors in animals, suggesting that ras genes are targets of carcinogens and that they are likely to participate in the initiation of neoplastic transformation (9.Barbacid M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 779-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (3778) Google Scholar). The transforming activity of activated ras depends on its interaction with multiple downstream effectors, which mediate different aspects of oncogenic transformation (10.Marshall C.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 197-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar, 11.Shields J.M. Pruitt K. McFall A. Shaub A. Der C.J.

Activated ERKs have been shown to promote cell proliferation in tumor cells (18.Graves L.M. Guy H.I. Kozlowski P. Huang M. Lazarowski E. Pope R.M. Collins M.A. Dahlstrand E.N. Earp III, H.S.

Biol. 1999; 19: 321-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). In early passage primary human and rodent cells, however, the outcome of ras activation alone is somewhat different. Expression of activated ras was initially mitogenic but eventually caused a permanent cell cycle arrest in G1 when activation was sustained for a few days (21.Serrano M. Lin A.W. McCurrach M.E. Beach D. Lowe S.W. Cell. 1997; 88: 593-602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3965) Google Scholar, 22.Tremain R. Marko M. Kinnimulki V. Ueno H. Bottinger E. Glick A. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 1698-1709Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The arrest was phenotypically indistinguishable from replicative senescence observed in late passage primary cells, indicating that oncogenic ras induces premature senescence in these otherwise proliferating, early passage cells. The premature senescence induced by ras was accompanied by accumulation of cell cycle inhibitors such as p53, p21WAF1, p16INK4A, and/or p19ARF, decreased expression of cyclin A, and reduced kinase activity of cyclin-dependent protein kinase-2 (21.Serrano M. Lin A.W. McCurrach M.E. Beach D. Lowe S.W. Cell. 1997; 88: 593-602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3965) Google Scholar, 23.Dimri G.P. Itahana K. Acosta M. Campisi J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 273-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar), all of which are characteristics consistent with growth arrest. The ability of ras to induce premature senescence relies on the activation of the Raf-1/MEK/ERK MAPK pathway that also mediates cell proliferation (24.Lin A.W. Barradas M. Stone J.C. Van Aelst L. Serrano M. Lowe S.W. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3008-3019Crossref PubMed Scopus (766) Google Scholar, 25.Zhu J. Woods D. McMahon M. Bishop J.M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2997-3007Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). We recently showed that the stress-induced p38 MAPK acted downstream of MEK to mediate ras-induced p16INK4A expression and senescence (26.Wang W. Chen J.X. Liao R. Deng Q. Zhou J.J. Huang S. Sun P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3389-3403Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Upon activation by ras, MEK subsequently stimulates the activity of p38-activating kinases MKK3 and MKK6, resulting in the induction of p38 activity. Constitutive activation of p38 by active MKK3 or MKK6 is sufficient to induce premature senescence. In addition, ras fails to provoke senescence when p38 activity is inhibited, suggesting an essential role of p38 in the induction of senescence response. These findings imply that the p38 pathway, when activated by ras, can limit the transforming potential of ras in primary cells by inducing premature senescence. The ability of oncogenic ras to induce senescence-like growth arrest as well as proliferation and transformation suggests that mechanisms must exist that regulate the switch in the signal specificity of ras in cells. In this study, we attempt to explore these mechanisms. Because the ras expression levels vary substantially in human tumors, ranging from severalfold to more than 50-fold over the wild-type levels (6.Elenbaas B. Spirio L. Koerner F. Fleming M.D. Zimonjic D.B. Donaher J.L. Popescu N.C. Hahn W.C. Weinberg R.A. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 50-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar, 27.Bos J.L. Mutat. Res. 1988; 195: 255-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar), we investigated the impact of differential expression levels of oncogenic ras on cellular responses in primary human fibroblasts. We show that the type of response ras triggers in these cells relies on the strength of ras expression. Whereas a strong ras signal induces premature senescence, moderate ras activity promotes cell proliferation and oncogenic transformation. Further studies reveal that ras signals of different strength lead to differential activation of separate MAPK pathways that mediate these distinct cellular responses. Moderate ras signals stimulate the activity of the mitogenic MEK-ERK pathway but not that of the senescence-inducing MKK3/6-p38 pathway. In contrast, high intensity ras signals induce MEK-ERK to a higher degree, which results in activation of the MKK3/6-p38 pathway and increased expression of p16INK4A. These results have therefore provided a molecular mechanism by which oncogenic ras can confer opposing effects on proliferation in the same cells. Cell Culture—BJ human foreskin fibroblasts (a gift from Dr. J. Smith, Baylor College of Medicine) were maintained in minimum essential medium with 10% fetal calf serum, non-essential amino acids, and glutamine. LinX-A retroviral packaging cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum and glutamine. Retroviral Vectors and Their Transduction—WZL-hygro- and Babepuro-HaRasV12 were obtained from Dr. Lowe (21.Serrano M. Lin A.W. McCurrach M.E. Beach D. Lowe S.W.

King J.E. Elenbaas B. Sabatini D.M. DeCaprio J.A. Weinberg R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 2111-2123Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). LXSN-E6, -E7, and -E6E7 were from Dr. Galloway (30.Halbert C.L. Demers G.W. Galloway D.A. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 473-478Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mutant E7 was generated by site-directed mutagenesis (QuikChange kit, Stratagene). HaRasV12 and GAPDH, GFP, E6E7, or E6 were subcloned downstream and upstream of the PGK promoter, respectively, in the binary vector (J. Wang, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory). Retrovirus-mediated gene transduction was carried out as described previously using an amphotropic packaging cell line (LinX-A) (31.Sun P. Dong P. Dai K. Hannon G.J. Beach D. Science. 1998; 282: 2270-2272Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). We typically achieved 20–30% infection rates in BJ cells. Transduced cells were purified with 100 μg/ml hygromycin B, 400 μg/ml G418, and/or 1 μg/ml puromycin. Western Blot—Cells were lysed in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 120 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, Complete protease inhibitor mix, Roche Applied Science). Protein concentrations were determined by Bradford assays. 20–80 μg of proteins were separated on 10% SDS-PAGE gel and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The primary antibodies used were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Ha-Ras C-20, ERK2 C-14, p21 C-19, cyclin A, cyclin D1, and cyclin B), Cell Signaling (phospho-MEK1/2 Ser-217/221, phospho-ERK Thr-202/Tyr-204, ERK1/2, phospho-MKK3/MKK6 Ser-189/207, MKK3, phospho-p38 Thr-180/Tyr-182, and p38), Novocastra (p16INK4A DCS-50 and p53 CM1), Pharmingen (Rb G3–245), and Sigma (actin). The anti-cyclin E monoclonal antibody was a gift from Dr. Steve Reed (The Scripps Research Institute). Reactive proteins were visualized using ECL. Some of the chemiluminescence signals (e.g. for Ras and phospho-ERK) were captured and quantified by the FluorChem™-8900 Imaging System (AlphaInnotech). Analysis of Senescence—Cells infected with ras or control viruses at PD12–25 were selected with proper drugs for 4 days and analyzed for senescence. The day when drug selection was completed (6 days after infection) was defined as day 0. For analysis of the cells expressing doxycycline-inducible Ha-RasV12, day 0 was defined as the day when the doxycycline treatment started. For growth curves, cells were plated in 12-well plates at 104/well in duplicates or triplicates. Every 3–4 days, cells were harvested and counted. At each split, 104 cells were reseeded to fresh plates and allowed to grow until next split. Population doublings (PD) were calculated with the formula PD = log(n2/n1)/log2, where n1 is the number of cells seeded and n2 is that recovered (32.Shay J.W. Wright W.E. Exp. Cell Res. 1989; 184: 109-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Cells with senescence-associated β-galactosidase activity were detected as described previously (21.Serrano M. Lin A.W. McCurrach M.E. Beach D. Lowe S.W. Cell. 1997; 88: 593-602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3965) Google Scholar). At least 200 cells were counted in randomly chosen fields for each sample. Proliferation Assay—3 days after retroviral infection, BJ cells (PD25) transduced with WZL-Hygro-Ha-rasV12, binary vectors for Ha-rasV12, or control vectors were grown in medium containing 0.1% FBS for 24 h before being labeled with 50 μm BrdUrd (Sigma) for 2 h. Cells were harvested and fixed in 70% ethanol at 4 °C overnight. Cells were then treated with 2 n HCl, 0.5% Triton X-100 for 30 min at room temperature, followed by neutralization with 0.1 m Na2B4O7 and subsequent incubation with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-BrdUrd antibody (BD Biosciences) for 1 h at room temperature. Finally, cells were washed with PBS, 1% BSA, 0.5% Tween 20, resuspended in PBS containing 5 μg/ml propidium iodide, and analyzed by two-dimensional flow cytometry. Construction of Cell Lines Expressing Doxycycline-inducible HarasV12—BJ cells (PD17) were serially infected with Babe-puro-hTERT and a virus expressing rtTA (WZL-Neo-rtTA) (33.Gossen M. Freundlieb S. Bender G. Muller G. Hillen W. Bujard H. Science. 1995; 268: 1766-1769Crossref PubMed Scopus (2040) Google Scholar). WZL-Neo-rtTA was a gift from Dr. R. Maestro (CRO-IRCCS, National Cancer Institute, Aviano, Italy). Single cell clones were isolated after drug selection, transduced individually with a retrovirus expressing a LacZ reporter under the control of a doxycycline-inducible promoter (BabeSIN-Hygrotet-LacZ), and tested for the induction of LacZ expression by doxycycline. The most responsive clone (before transduction of BabeSIN-Hygro-tet-LacZ) was selected and transduced with a virus expressing doxycycline-inducible Ha-RasV12 (BabeSIN-Hygro-tet-HaRasV12). Transduced cells were purified by selection with 10 μg/ml hygromycin. Single-cell clones were isolated, propagated, and tested for induction of Ha-RasV12 by different concentrations of doxycycline. Tumorigenic Assays—BJ cells (PD10–20) were serially transduced with hTERT and other oncogenes to construct transformed cell lines. For soft agar assays, 104 cells at PD30–45 were resuspended in 2 ml of growth medium containing 0.3% low melting temperature agarose (Sea-Plaque GTG, FMC BioProducts) and plated onto 2 ml of solidified bottom layer medium containing 0.5% low melting agarose in 6-well plates in triplicates. Cultures were fed every 7–10 days. Colonies were stained with 0.02% Giemsa and counted 4 weeks after plating. For tumor formation assays, 5 × 106 cells at PD30–45 were resuspended in 100 μl of serum-free RPMI 1640 medium and injected subcutaneously into 6–8-week-old female athymic WEHI nude mice (Rodent Breeding Colony, The Scripps Research Institute). Tumor size was measured every 4–6 days, and the volume of a tumor was calculated with the formula V = (L × W2)/2, where L and W indicate the length and width of a tumor, respectively (24.Lin A.W. Barradas M. Stone J.C. Van Aelst L. Serrano M. Lowe S.W. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3008-3019Crossref PubMed Scopus (766) Google Scholar). To culture the tumor cells, tumors were removed from mice, washed with PBS, minced with razor blades, and incubated with 0.15% collagenase type I at 37 °C for 1 h. The dissociated cells were washed with complete medium, filtered through a sterile gauze pad, and plated. Appropriate drug selection was applied to eliminate mouse cells from the culture. Southern Blot—Cells were lysed in 10 mm Tris, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, and 1% SDS. The lysates were treated with 120 μg/ml RNase A and 0.5 mg/ml proteinase K and extracted with phenol/chloroform. Genomic DNA was precipitated and resuspended in H2O. 8 μg of EcoRI-digested DNA was separated on 1% agarose gel and transferred to Hybond N+ membrane in 0.4 m NaOH. After UV cross-linking and pre-hybridizing in 1% BSA, 0.4 m NaPO4, pH 7.0, 15% formamide, 1 mm EDTA, and 7% SDS, the blot was hybridized in the same solution to a DNA probe encoding the hygromycin resistance gene, which was labeled with α-[32P]dATP and α-[32P]dCTP by random priming. Signals were visualized on a PhosphorImager. Karyotype Analysis—Chromosome spreads from pre- or post-tumor cells were prepared, stained, and analyzed following standard protocols as described previously (34.Wu B.L. Schneider G.H. Sabatino D.E. Bozovic L.Z. Cao B. Korf B.R. Am. J. Med. Genet. 1996; 62: 77-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 35.Seabright M. Lancet. 1971; 2: 971-972Abstract PubMed Scopus (4202) Google Scholar). For each sample, detailed chromosome analysis was performed with 20 GTG-banded metaphase cells of at least the 450–500-band level. Induction of Premature Senescence Relies on the Strength of Oncogenic ras Signals—Although ras is frequently activated in human tumors, the expression levels of activated ras vary from severalfold to more than 50-fold (6.Elenbaas B. Spirio L. Koerner F. Fleming M.D. Zimonjic D.B. Donaher J.L. Popescu N.C. Hahn W.C. Weinberg R.A. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 50-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar, 27.Bos J.L. Mutat. Res. 1988; 195: 255-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar). In fact, ras genes activated through point mutations are usually not overexpressed at very high levels. This prompted us to explore the relationship between the signaling intensity of oncogenic ras and its ability to induce senescence in primary human cells. Two retroviral expression vectors, both derived from the same Moloney murine leukemia virus-based expression plasmid (WZL-Hygro), were used to achieve differential expression levels of Ha-rasV12 (Fig. 1A). WZL-Hygro-HaRasV12 was used previously to express Ha-rasV12 and induce senescence (21.Serrano M. Lin A.W. McCurrach M.E. Beach D. Lowe S.W. Cell. 1997; 88: 593-602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3965) Google Scholar, 24.Lin A.W. Barradas M. Stone J.C. Van Aelst L. Serrano M. Lowe S.W. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3008-3019Crossref PubMed Scopus (766) Google Scholar). A second binary vector was essentially the same as WZL-Hygro-HaRasV12 but contained an additional neutral gene (GFP or GAPDH) and a PGK promoter downstream of the 5′-long terminal repeat. In this vector, the expression of the upstream neutral gene was directed by the viral long terminal repeat, whereas the downstream Ha-rasV12 was expressed from the PGK promoter. We consistently found that expression of Ha-rasV12 was reduced by the presence of the upstream gene. By using these two vectors, Ha-rasV12 was stably transduced into early passaged human foreskin fibroblast cells (BJ). In the presence of an upstream gene (GFP, GAPDH, E6, or E6E7), the expression levels of Ha-RasV12 from the binary vectors were 3–6-fold higher than that in the control cells not transduced with ras (Fig. 3). On the other hand, the WZL-Hygro-HaRasV12 vector conferred more than 20-fold overexpression of ras. Ras overexpressed by more than 20-fold led to a higher degree of activation of its downstream signaling components, MEK and ERK, than when overexpressed by 3–6-fold (Fig. 3), indicating that higher expression levels of ras had indeed generated stronger ras signals in BJ cells.Fig. 3Activation of the ERK and p38 MAPK pathways relies on the strength of oncogenic ras expression. Western blot analysis of the protein levels of Ras, MEK phosphorylated at Ser-217 and Ser-221, ERK phosphorylated at Thr-202 and Tyr-204, ERK2, p38 phosphorylated at Thr-180 and Tyr-182, p38, p21Cip1, p16INK4A, Rb, cyclin (Cyc) A, cyclin B, cyclin D1, cyclin E, and actin in BJ cells 8 days after transduction of high (WH-Ras) or moderate levels (GAPDH-, GFP-, E6E7-, and E6-PGKRas) of Ha-RasV12 or a vector control (WH). The relative ras expression levels were quantified by the FluorChem™-8900 software, normalized to the basal ras level, and indicated in the figure. The ras signals from cells transduced with WH-Ras (indicated by *) were quantified manually because they were overexposed and beyond the linear range of quantification with the software.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Confirming previous findings, Ha-RasV12 induced premature senescence in BJ cells when overexpressed from WZL-Hygro at high levels (Fig. 1, B and C). These cells stopped proliferating and accumulated senescence-associated β-galactosidase, a marker distinguishing senescence from other types of growth arrest (36.Dimri G.P. Lee X. Basile G. Acosta M. Scott G. Roskelley C. Medrano E.E. Linskens M. Rubelj I. Pereira-Smith O. Peacocke M. Campisi J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9363-9367Crossref PubMed Scopus (5738) Google Scholar). In contrast, when Ha-RasV12 was expressed at relatively lower levels from the binary vectors, cells did not undergo premature senescence. Unlike the cells with high levels of ras, these cells showed exponential growth kinetics (Fig. 1B) and did not accumulate senescence-associated β-galactosidase (Fig. 1C). In addition, these cells displayed normal morphology of fibroblasts, whereas cells expressing high ras levels became large and flat, showing morphology typical of senescence (data not shown). BJ cells transduced with binary vectors expressing only GFP or GAPDH grew at similar rates as those transduced with the WH vector, indicating that GFP and GAPDH alone had no effect on cell proliferation. Thus, the ability of oncogenic ras to induce senescence depends on the intensity of its expression levels. Oncogenic ras provokes senescence-like growth arrest in primary human fibroblasts only when it is highly expressed. Oncogenic ras Is Mitogenic When Expressed at Moderate Levels—Whereas the moderate ras expression levels did not trigger senescence in BJ cells, we determined the ability of ras to promote cell proliferation when expressed at moderate levels. BJ cells overexpressing Ha-RasV12 by 3–5-fold above the background from the binary vectors consistently displayed higher growth rates than those transduced with the vector control, when the cells were continuously grown in complete medium (Fig. 1B). We estimated that the doubling time of the cells reduced from 1.4 days to 1.0 day upon the transduction of moderate expression levels of ras. To determine further the mitogenic activity of ras, the rate of BrdUrd incorporation was measured in BJ cells under serum starvation. Transduction of BJ cells with moderate expression levels of ras resulted in a 2–3-fold increase in BrdUrd incorporation when the cells were grown in a low serum-containing medium (Fig. 2). A similar degree of increase in BrdUrd incorporation was observed in cells transduced with high levels of ras, before premature senescence occurred (Fig. 2), confirming published observations (24.Lin A.W. Barradas M. Stone J.C. Van Aelst L. Serrano M. Lowe S.W. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3008-3019Crossref PubMed Scopus (766) Google Scholar, 26.Wang W. Chen J.X. Liao R. Deng Q. Zhou J.J. Huang S. Sun P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3389-3403Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Expression of GFP or GAPDH alone from the binary vectors had no effect on the rate of BrdUrd incorporation (Fig. 2), suggesting that the increases in BrdUrd incorporation observed in cells transduced with the binary vectors were indeed due to the moderate ras expression. Therefore, although ras signals of moderate intensity did not induce senescence, they stimulated proliferation in primary BJ human fibroblasts as did the high intensity ras signals. This notion was confirmed by the finding that both moderate and high intensity ras signals led to increased protein levels of cyclin E (Fig. 3), which plays an important role in promoting G1/S transition. Thus, our results demonstrated that ras triggered opposing cellular responses when present in cells at different intensity. Although moderate ras activity was mitogenic, higher ras activity led to growth arrest and premature senescence. Ras Signals of Different Intensity Differ in Their Abilities to Activate the ERK and p38 MAPK Pathways and to Induce Senescence-associated Changes—One of the downstream effectors that ras relies on to transmit mitogenic signals and confer tumorigenesis is the Raf/MEK/ERK MAPK pathway (37.Kolch W. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 289-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (1218) Google Scholar, 38.Wasylyk B. Hagman J. Gutierrez-Hartmann A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 213-216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). This pathway is also essential for ras to induce the senescence response in primary cells (24.Lin A.W.

Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2997-3007Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). We have showed earlier that active MEK leads to the activation of p38 MAPK that in turn mediates the induction of p16INK4A and senescence (26.Wang W. Chen J.X. Liao R. Deng Q. Zhou J.J. Huang S. Sun P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3389-3403Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). In order to explore the possible molecular mechanism underlyi"

Mutations in AQP2 lead to nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, a disorder in which functional AQP2 is not expressed on the apical cell surface of kidney collecting duct principal cells. The mechanisms and pathways directing AQP2 from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi complex and beyond have not been defined. We found that ∼25% of newly synthesized AQP2 is glycosylated.

Yasui M. King L.S. Agre P. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 109: 1395-1399Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). AQPs share a highly conserved domain organization with six transmembrane domains and cytoplasmically oriented N and C termini. AQPs form tetramers or sometimes higher order oligomers in membranes. Structural studies of AQP1 revealed that the functional unit is a tetramer with each monomer providing an independent water pore (2.Murata K. Mitsuoka K. Hirai T. Walz T. Agre P. Heymann J.B. Engel A. Fujiyoshi Y. Nature. 2000; 407: 599-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (1394) Google Scholar). Stability of the tetramer is thought to be conferred by the assembly of monomers as a tight fitting wedge within the tetramer. With the exception of AQP2, which is regulated by the antidiuretic hormone vasopressin, most of the AQPs are expressed constitutively at the plasma membrane (see Ref. 3.Nielsen S. Frokjaer J. Marples D. Kwon T.H. Agre P. Knepper M.A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 205-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (1005) Google Scholar). AQP2 is localized in a tubulovesicular subapical storage compartment. The intracellular retention is thought to be caused by tethering of the storage vesicles to the actin cytoskeleton and is regulated by members of the rho subfamily of small GTPases (4.Klussmann E.

Binding of vasopressin to the basolateral V2 receptor increases cAMP concentration which activates protein kinase A. Protein kinase A phosphorylates AQP2-Ser256 which is required for fusion of AQP2 storage vesicles with the plasma membrane (5.Fushimi K. Sasaki S. Marumo F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14800-14804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar, 6.van Balkom B.W.M. Savelkoul P.J.M. Markovich D. Hofman E. Nielsen S. van der Sluijs P. Deen P.M.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41473-41479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). The precise mechanism responsible for the recruitment of tetrameric AQP2 to the cell surface is not known, but phosphorylation of at least three of the four monomers, reportedly, is required and sufficient for the localization of AQP2 on the plasma membrane (7.Kamsteeg E.J. Heijnen I. van Os C.H. Deen P.M.T. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 919-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The regulated recruitment of plasma membrane proteins from intracellular storage vesicles provides an efficient means to control cell surface expression and was originally discovered for the insulin-regulated glucose transporter GLUT4 (see Ref. 8.Bryant N.J. Govers R. James D.E. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 267-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (907) Google Scholar). GLUT4 and AQP2 translocation share some similarities such as the requirement for the v-SNARE synaptobrevin-2 in fusion with the plasma membrane (8.Bryant N.J. Govers R. James D.E. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 267-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (907) Google Scholar, 9.Gouraud S. Laera A. Calmita G. Carmosini M. Procino G. Rosetto O. Mannucci R. Rosenthal W. Svelto M. Valenti G. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 3667-3674Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, there are important differences. For instance, GLUT4 translocates from a basolateral storage compartment in polarized epithelial cells, and phosphorylation of GLUT4 inhibits glucose transport, whereas phosphorylation of AQP2 is essential for its recruitment from an apical storage compartment. Despite the progress that has been made in understanding the physiology of AQP-mediated water transport, important aspects such as biosynthetic maturation and intracellular transport of AQP water channels are incompletely understood. For instance, it has been shown for AQP1 that conformational changes and rearrangements take place during insertion in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), but whether insertion occurs cotranslationally or post-translationally has become a controversial issue (10.Skach W.R. Shi L. Calayag M.C. Frigeri A. Lingapppa V.R. Verkman A.S. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 803-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 11.Dohke Y. Turner R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15215-15219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In addition, with the exception of AQP4 (12.Madrid R. Le Maout S. Barrault M.B. Janvier K. Benichou S. Merot J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 7008-7021Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), the sorting signals required for transport of AQPs between intracellular compartments remain to be defined. The observations that AQP2 and AQP6 (13.Yasui M. Hazama A. Kwon T.H. Nielsen S. Guggino W.B. Agre P.

The consensus N-linked glycosylation site in AQP1 and AQP2 is used inefficiently. Most of the AQP1 and AQP2 molecules on the cell surface remain unglycosylated (14.Smith B.L. Preston G.M. Spring F.A. Anstee D.J. Agre P. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 1043-1049Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15.Baumgarten R. van de Pol M.H.J. Wetzels J.F.M. van Os C.H. Deen P.M.T. J. Am. Soc.

Nephrol. 2002; 13: 2267-2277Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), is not glycosylated because the consensus N-linked glycosylation motif is disrupted. This mutant is absent from the plasma membrane (17.Marr N. Bichet D.G. Hoefs S. Savelkoul P.J.M. Konings I.B.M. de Mattia F. Graat M.P.J. Arthus M.F. Lonergan M. Fujiwara T.M. Knoers N.V.A.M.

The significance of this observation transcends well beyond the particular AQP2-T125M patient mutant because it translates directly into two general questions relating to mechanisms responsible for ER quality control of AQPs and how nonglycosylated wild-type AQP2 is normally targeted to the plasma membrane. Mutations in AQP2 result in NDI (see Ref. 18.Morello J.P. Bichet D.G. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2001; 63: 607-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar) through two putative mechanisms. Recessive nonfunctional mutants are thought to be retained in the ER and fail to tetramerize, whereas dominant AQP2 mutants oligomerize with the product of the wild-type allele, forming tetramers that are improperly targeted and do not reach the apical cell surface (19.Kamsteeg E.J. Wormhoudt T.A.M. Rijss J.P.L. van Os C.H. Deen P.M.T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2394-2400Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 20.Marr N. Bichet D.G. Lonergan M. Arthus M.F. Jeck N. Seyberth H.W. Rosenthal W. van Os C.H. Oksche A. Deen P.M.T. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 779-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Given the consequences of mutant AQP2 alleles for the health of affected individuals, surprisingly little is known about biosynthetic maturation and sorting of AQP2. To develop rationally therapeutic protocols for NDI, we need to understand the pathways of wild-type AQP2 to the cell surface. Earlier studies with tunicamycin were interpreted to indicate that glycosylation was not essential for AQP2 shuttling (15.Baumgarten R. van de Pol M.H.J. Wetzels J.F.M. van Os C.H. Deen P.M.T. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1998; 9: 1553-1559Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Given the recent findings that this glycosylation inhibitor severely affects multiple ER and secretory pathway functions (21.Ye J. Rawson R.B. Komuro R. Chen X. Dave U.P. Prywes R. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1355-1364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1311) Google Scholar, 22.Travers K.J. Patil C.K. Wodicka L. Lockhart D.J. Weissman J.S. Walter P. Cell. 2000; 101: 249-258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1562) Google Scholar), a reevaluation of the significance of glycosylation in AQP2 function became necessary. Using biochemical and morphological methods, we show that tetramerization of AQP2 occurs in the ER and that N-linked glycosylation is important for its transport from the Golgi complex to post-Golgi compartments. Reagents—AQP2-N123Q was constructed by overlap extension PCR and ligated in pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). Synthetic cDNAs were verified by restriction analysis and dye termination sequencing. Furin-pEGFP was generously provided by Gary Thomas. Antibodies against the C terminus of AQP2 were raised in rabbits and guinea pigs as described (23.Deen P.M.T. van Aubel R.A. van Lieburg A.F. van Os C.H. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1996; 7: 836-841PubMed Google Scholar). The following antibodies were used: rabbit anti-protein disulfide isomerase and rabbit anti-calnexin (Ineke Braakman, University of Utrecht), mouse anti-gp114 (Kai Simons, Max Planck Institute, Dresden), mouse anti-CTR433 (Michel Bornens, Curie Institute, Paris), and mouse anti-α-tubulin Thomas Kreis, University of Geneva). The mouse antibodies against γ-adaptin and GM130 were from Transduction Labs, and conjugated secondary antibodies were purchased from Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories and Molecular Probes. Cell Culture and Transfection—Madin-Darby canine kidney type I (MDCK-I) cells expressing human wild-type AQP2, or vesicular stomatitis virus G-tagged AQP2-R187C were maintained as described (24.Deen P.M.T. Rijss J.P.L. Mulders S.M. Errington R.J. van Baal J. van Os C.H. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1997; 8: 1493-1501Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). MDCK-I cells were transfected with AQP2-N123QpcDNA3 using the calcium phosphate method. CHO and CHO-15B cells were transfected with wild-type AQP2pcDNA3 and AQP2-N123QpcDNA3 in the same way. Stable transfectants were selected in medium containing 0.6 mg/ml G418 and screened by immunofluorescence microscopy and Western blot. Expression of cytomegalovirus-driven constructs was induced by culturing the cells for 14-17 h in the presence of 5 mm sodium butyrate. Pulse-Chase and Immunoprecipitation—Cells were grown in 6-cm tissue culture dishes, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and incubated for 30 min with methionine- and cysteine-free minimum Eagle's medium (Sigma). The cells were labeled for 30 min at 37 °C with 0.2 mCi/ml [35S]methionine/cysteine (Redivue Promix, Amersham Biosciences) and chased for different periods of time in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal calf serum, 1 mm methionine, 1 mm cysteine. Cells were lysed in 1 ml of 1% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, and a protease inhibitor mix (Complete mini, Roche Applied Science) on ice. Detergent lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 5 min to remove insoluble debris. Lysates were next precleared by incubation with bovine serum albumin-coated protein A beads for 1 h at 4 °C. The supernatants were then transferred to a fresh tube and incubated with antibody-coated beads for 2 h at 4 °C. Beads were washed three times at room temperature for 5 min with 0.05% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 0.3 m NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.6. Endoglycosidase H (Endo H) and peptide N-glycosidase F (PNGase F) digestions were performed on immune precipitates as described previously (25.Braakman I. Litty H.H. Wagner K.R. Helenius A. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 401-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Samples were resuspended in 25 μl of Laemmli sample buffer containing 50 mm dithiothreitol, incubated for 30 min at 37 °C, and resolved by SDS-PAGE on 12.5% gels. Quantitation of immunoprecipitated AQP2 was done by phosphorimaging. Immunoelectron Microscopy—MDCK-AQP2 and MDCK-AQP2-N123Q cells were fixed for immunoelectron microscopy with a mixture of 2% freshly prepared formaldehyde and 0.2% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. After 6 h at room temperature the fixative was replaced, and cells were postfixed in 2% formaldehyde overnight at 4 °C. Cells were then prepared for ultrathin cryosectioning and immunogold labeled according to the protein A-gold method. Briefly, fixed cells were washed once in phosphate-buffered saline with 0.02 m glycine, after which cells were scraped in 1% gelatin in phosphate-buffered saline and embedded in a 12% gelatin solution. The cell-gelatin mixture was solidified on ice and cut into small blocks. After infiltration with 2.3 m sucrose at 4 °C, blocks were mounted on aluminum pins and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Ultrathin cryosections were picked up in a mixture of 50% sucrose and 50% methyl cellulose (26.Liou W. Geuze H.J. Geelen M.J.H. Slot J.W. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 61-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) and incubated with a rabbit antibody against AQP2, which was used previously for the ultrastructural localization of AQP2 in Xenopus oocytes (27.Mulders S.M. Bichet D.G. Rijss J.P.L. Kamsteeg E.J. Arthus M.F. Lonergan M. Fujiwara M. Morgan K. Leijendekker R. van der Sluijs P. van Os C.H. Deen P.M.T. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 57-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Labeling was done with protein A coated with 10 nm of gold. Miscellaneous Methods—Methods for cRNA injection in Xenopus oocytes, water permeability measurements, immunofluorescence microscopy, cell surface biotinylation, and velocity gradient centrifugation have been described previously (17.Marr N.

Confocal laser scanning immunofluorescence microscopy of MDCK cells was done as described previously (29.Deneka M. Neeft M. Popa I. van Oort M. Sprong H. Oorschot V. Klumperman J. Schu P. van der Sluijs P. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2645-2657Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Biosynthesis and Maturation of AQP2—To investigate the biosynthesis of AQP2 we used the MDCK cell line. These cells lack measurable levels of endogenous AQP2, whereas transfected AQP2 is subject to vasopressin-dependent translocation like AQP2 in the kidney (24.Deen P.M.T. Rijss J.P.L. Mulders S.M. Errington R.J. van Baal J. van Os C.H. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1997; 8: 1493-1501Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). MDCK-AQP2 cells were pulse labeled with [35S]methionine/cysteine, and AQP2 was immunoprecipitated from detergent lysates after different periods of chase time and analyzed by SDS-PAGE on 12.5% reducing gels. As shown in Fig. 1A, two bands of 29 and 31-32 kDa (which we refer to as 31 kDa) can be discerned which are not present in immunoprecipitates prepared from nontransfected cells (not shown). Quantification of the 29- and 31-kDa bands at the end of the 30-min pulse by phosphorimaging showed that they are formed at a ratio of 3:1. Even after a short pulse of 2.5 min, about 25% of newly synthesized AQP2 was present in the 31-kDa band, suggesting that glycosylation occurs cotranslationally or very shortly after translation. Whereas the 29-kDa form remained present at all chase times, the 31-kDa form disappeared within 1-1.5 h of chase, and at the same time, a complex of proteins appeared as a faint smear of 40-46 kDa. We then explored the relationship between the 29-, 31-, and the 40-46-kDa bands using Endo H and PNGase F digestions of AQP2 immunoprecipitates. As shown in Fig. 1A, Endo H selectively removed the 31-kDa band but not the 29-kDa and 40-46-kDa bands, whereas after PNGase F only the 29-kDa protein remained detectable as a doublet. PNGase F treatment causes oxidation of the asparagine to an aspartate in the consensus N-linked glycosylation sequence. This modification adds extra negative charge to the protein which might be responsible for a small shift in mobility on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Alternatively, the hydrophobic transmembrane domains of AQP2, which represent ∼50% of its mass, might fail to be completely denatured in SDS. This could limit the accessibility of the N-linked glycosylation site to PNGase F, preventing quantitative deglycosylation. Disappearance of the 31-kDa band within 1 h after translation and the appearance of the 40-46-kDa bands indicate transport from the ER to the Golgi complex. Although some of 40-46-kDa material is already present at the end of the pulse period, it is unlikely that complex glycosylation of AQP2 occurs cotranslationally. Assuming a translation rate of 5-10 amino acids/s (25.Braakman I. Litty H.H. Wagner K.R. Helenius A. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 401-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 30.Horwitz M.S. Scharff M.D. Maizel J.V.J. Virology. 1969; 39: 682-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), the pulse period is relatively long compared with the time it takes to translate the 270-amino acid protein AQP2. Likely the AQP2 molecules that were synthesized at the beginning of the pulse may have already left the ER. Indeed, when the pulse is reduced to 2.5 min, we did not observe the 40-46 kDa smear (Fig. 1A, lane indicated with *). The 29-kDa form of AQP2 is a very stable molecular species. After an initial decrease during the 1st h of the chase (likely because of degradation in the ER and transport to the Golgi complex), the half-life of this form is in the order of 6-12 h. The results of the pulse-chase experiments extend and confirm earlier steady-state measurements that document that the 29-kDa band represents nonglycosylated AQP2, whereas the 31- and 40-46-kDa bands are the high mannose and the complex glycosylated forms, respectively. Because the complex glycosylated forms of newly synthesized AQP2 ran as a faint smear between 40 and 46 kDa and because of a background signal along the entire length of the lane, an accurate quantification of the glycoforms was problematic and precluded the investigation of product precursor relationships between the various forms. To avoid this problem we expressed AQP2 in CHO-15B cells that lack functional GlcNAc transferase I (31.Schlesinger S. Gottlieb C. Feil P. Gelb N. Kornfeld S. J. Virol. 1975; 17: 239-246Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and do not express endogenous AQP2. This enzyme adds N-acetylglucosamine to mannose residues after trimming of the GlcNac2Man9Glc3 oligosaccharide by ER and Golgi mannosidases. In the absence of a functional enzyme, complex glycosylated proteins are not formed, and the resulting mannose-trimmed glycoproteins have a slightly higher mobility than the high mannose precursor. Results of pulse-chase experiments in CHO-15B-AQP2 cells are shown in Fig. 1B. As in MDCK cells, ∼75% of newly synthesized AQP2 was present in the 29-kDa band and was not glycosylated at the end of the pulse, whereas the remainder of radioactivity was present in the 31-kDa band. During the chase period this Endo H-sensitive band (not shown) was converted to a discrete band of 30 kDa. Quantification of the three bands (Fig. 1B) shows a clear precursor-product link between the high mannose and the 30-kDa glycosylated forms of AQP2. The kinetics of AQP2 glycosylation in MDCK and CHO-15B cells was similar, suggesting that the limited extent of glycosylation is not a property of the cells but instead is determined by intrinsic features contained within the AQP2 molecule. As in MDCK cells, the nonglycosylated and terminally glycosylated form of wild-type AQP2 are stable proteins, whose levels decrease with a half-life of 6-12 h after the 1st h of chase, indicating that glycosylation is not essential for the stability of the wild-type protein. The consensus site for N-linked glycosylation is located in the second extracellular loop, 7 amino acid residues upstream of the predicted fourth transmembrane domain. Efficient glycosylation requires a distance of at least 10 amino acids from a C-terminal transmembrane domain, possibly because space constraints combined with egress through the translocon limit a productive interaction with oligosaccharyltransferase (32.Nilsson I. von Heijne G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17338-17343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). We therefore hypothesized that a prolonged residence time of AQP2 in the ER would increase glycosylation. To address this issue, we performed pulse-chase experiments in MDCK cells expressing vesicular stomatitis virus G-tagged AQP2-R187C (Fig. 1C), a mutant that is retained in the ER in recessive NDI (33.Deen P.M.T. Croes H. van Aubel R.A. Ginsel L.A. van Os C.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 2291-2296Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1C, the amount of the high mannose precursor of the mutant continued to increase during the first 2 h of chase. This is in sharp contrast to wild-type AQP2 for which the level of the high mannose form decreased continually after the pulse (Fig. 1A). Thus this result suggests that prolonged residence of AQP2 in the ER enhanced the efficiency of glycosylation in a post-translational manner. Glycosylation Is Required for Cell Surface Expression of AQP2—To analyze the function of N-linked glycosylation we substituted Asn123 for Gln and expressed this AQP2 mutant in MDCK cells. We first investigated the synthesis and stability of AQP2-N123Q in pulse-chase experiments of 35S-labeled cells followed by immunoprecipitation and SDS-PAGE. As expected and shown in Fig. 2A, removal of the N-linked glycosylation consensus site did not affect expression of the nonglycosylated 29-kDa precursor; however, neither the 31-kDa nor the mature 42-46-kDa were present. Quantitation of the 29-kDa band showed that its half-time was reduced from 6-12 h in MDCKAQP2 cells to 4 h in the MDCK-AQP2-N123Q cells. Many glycoproteins are O-glycosylated in the Golgi complex. It is not known, however, whether AQPs are O-glycosylated. Removal of the N-linked glycosylation motif in AQP2 produced a protein that ran as single sharp band on SDS-polyacrylamide gels during the pulse and all chase times, suggesting that AQP2 is not O-glycosylated in these cells. Given the reduced stability of the glycosylation mutant, we next addressed whether or not this protein was misfolded, using water permeability in Xenopus oocytes as read-out system. Although oocytes lack the mechanisms for vasopressin-regulated translocation of AQP2, they nevertheless are very valuable for determining the biophysical properties of water channels (28.Deen P.M.T. Verdijk M.A. Knoers N.V.A.M. Wieringa B. Monnens L.A.H. van Os C.H. van Oost B.A. Science. 1994; 264: 92-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar). We injected wild-type AQP2 and AQP2-N123Q cRNAs in Xenopus oocytes and measured water permeability of the plasma membrane. As documented in Fig. 2B, both proteins were expressed at the same level at the plasma membrane and yielded similar water permeability. This showed that the absence of glycosylation did not affect the ability of AQP2 to form functional water channels and suggests that AQP2-N123Q is not misfolded. To investigate whether AQP2-N123Q reached the cell surface in a more physiological model, we performed cell surface biotinylation in the MDCK-AQP2-N123Q cells. Biotinylated proteins were then retrieved from detergent lysates by neutravidin-agarose precipitation, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by Western blot. Although wild-type AQP2 was expressed at the plasma membrane, AQP2-N123Q was not detected on the cell surface (Fig. 2C). To rule out that the AQP2 signal on the plasma membrane was the result of cell leakage, causing biotinylation of intracellular proteins, we also analyzed the blots with a tubulin antibody. As expected, we did detect tubulin in total cell lysates; however, it was not retrieved on the neutravidin beads, showing that the plasma membrane remained intact during the experiment. Because plasma membrane expression of AQP2 can be induced by vasopressin or forskolin treatment, we added 10 μm forskolin to the cells. Even under this condition AQP2-N123Q was retained intracellularly. The observation that AQP2-N123Q is not delivered to the cell surface suggested that the mutant either cannot leave the ER or is allowed to exit the ER but retained in another compartment. To discriminate between these possibilities, we investigated the localization of AQP2-N123Q. Cells were treated with either indomethacin or forskolin, which diminishes or enhances cAMP-dependent AQP2 expression on the apical cell surface (24.Deen P.M.T. Rijss J.P.L. Mulders S.M. Errington R.J. van Baal J. van Os C.H. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1997; 8: 1493-1501Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), respectively. As shown in Fig. 2D, AQP2-N123Q is predominantly localized in perinuclear structures but not on the plasma membrane. We confirmed with confocal immunofluorescence microscopy on filter-grown AQP2-N123Q MDCK cells, that the mutant was localized intracellularly (not shown). Even though the various kinase consensus sequences are retained in the mutant, it is clear that AQP2-N123Q localization is not affected by the drugs. In contrast wild-type AQP2 is translocated to the cell surface in the presence of forskolin, whereas the level of wild-type AQP2 at the cell surface is decreased by indomethacin as was reported before (Fig. 2D). Thus, glycosylation of AQP2 is required for cell surface expression, and the absence of glycosylation induces intracellular retention. Glycosylation of AQP2 Is Not Essential for Exit from the ER—To define the location where nonglycosylated AQP2 is retained, we performed double label immun"

We have observed that a specific type of κB DNA sequence motif supports both NF-κB p65 homodimer binding and cooperativity with non-tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT3. This activity, in contrast to that mediated by κB DNA motifs that do not efficiently bind p65 homodimers, is shown to be uniquely dependent upon signal transduction through the carboxyl terminus of TRAF6. Furthermore, STAT3 and p65 are shown to physically interact, in vivo, and this interaction appears to inhibit the function of “classical” STAT3 GAS-like binding sites. The distinct p50 form of NF-κB is also shown to interact with STAT3. However, in contrast to p65, p50 cooperates with STAT3 bound to GAS sites. These data argue for a novel transcription factor cross-talk mechanism that may help resolve inconsistencies previously reported regarding the mechanism of IL-1 inhibition of IL-6 activity during the acute-phase response.

One of the important homeostatic processes is the acute phase response (APR) in which various stress stimuli, such as microbiological products, injury, and neoplasia, result in the activation of endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, and antigen-presenting cells such as macrophages, which in turn express cytokines such as IL-1, TNF, and IL-6. These cytokines can induce targets, such as endothelial, fibroblast, chondrocyte, osteoclast, and pituitary cells, to express factors important for both cellular and humoral immunity. These factors include IL-4, -5, -12, and -18 as well as secondary expression of additional IL-1, -6, and TNF. This organism-wide phenomenon has recently been referred to as the “danger response” (1.Matzinger P. Science. 2002; 296: 301-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (3348) Google Scholar). The liver is an important component of the APR and has been exhaustively studied (2.Baumann H. Gauldie J. Immunol. Today. 1994; 15: 74-80Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). Central to the activation of the liver is the induction of distinct gene collectives that are primarily under the control of three transcription factors, namely STAT3, NF-κB, and C/EBPβ. STAT3 is activated from a cytoplasmic non-tyrosine-phosphorylated monomer to a nuclear localized tyrosine-phosphorylated dimer by an IL-6-dependent signal transduction mechanism. Both C/EBPβ (also called NF-IL6) and NF-κB are activated either by IL-1 or TNF. C/EBPβ is activated by direct mitogen-activated protein kinase serine phosphorylation, which results in a conformational change of the constitutively inactive transcription factor (3.Kowenz-Leutz E. Twamley G. Ansieau S. Leutz A. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2781-2791Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 4.Williams S.C. Dillner B.M. Johnson P.F.

NF-κB is activated via either serine or tyrosine phosphorylation of the various forms of the IκB inhibitor that is subsequently released and usually degraded by the proteasome (5.Fan C. Li Q. Ross D. Engelhardt J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2072-2080Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Although IL-6 can also activate C/EBPβ, it cannot activate NF-κB. The IL-6 responses mediated by STAT3 are known to be somewhat independent of those associated with C/EBPβ and especially NF-κB. In fact, evidence has accumulated arguing that many of the IL-6 responses are inhibited by agents that activate NF-κB (6.Conti P. Bartle L. Barbacane R. Reale M. Sipe J. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1995; 142: 171-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 7.Zhang Z. Fuller G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 237: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 8.Zhang Z.

Immunol. 2001; 167: 1469-1481Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Yet, under some conditions the two responses are also cooperative. Although several models have been proposed to explain these apparently inconsistent observations, none is either entirely satisfactory or universally accepted (7.Zhang Z. Fuller G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 237: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 9.Bode J. Fischer R. Haussinger D. Graeve L. Heinrich P. Schaper F. J.

In the process of investigating such mechanisms, we discovered that an asymmetric functional relationship exists between STAT3 and NF-κB. This relationship is mechanistically dependent upon a protein-protein interaction between one form of NF-κB and monomeric aphosphotyrosine STAT3 (STAT3aPTyr). We have observed that NF-κB p65 homodimers can cooperate with STAT3aPTyr, when bound to a specific type of κB motif. Reciprocally, this interaction appears to inhibit function of “classical” STAT3 GAS-like binding sites. In contrast, NF-κB p50 can cooperate with STAT3 bound to STAT3 GAS sites. The specificity of the response is not only associated with the specific DNA binding site, but also the signal transduction pathway, which appears to rely upon the carboxyl-terminal meprin and TRAF homology (MATH) domain of TRAF6 for the selective activation of p65 homodimers. Together these data argue for a novel transcription factor cross-talk mechanism that may explain many of the controversial observations associated with APR and the activation of distinct forms of NF-κB. Cell Lines—Hep3B cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). Cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 4 mm l-glutamine, and 0.5% penicillin-streptomycin in humidified 10% CO2 and 90% air at 37 °C. HEK293R cells were derived from HEK293 cells (ATCC) and then stably transfected with pcDNA3.1 expression vector (Invitrogen) containing the cDNA sequence for the human IL-1 type I receptor chain (IL1RI) introduced by recombinant PCR subcloning. These cells generated a qualitatively similar response to the parental HEK293. However, the presence of IL1R1 amplified the response, generating a higher sensitivity. Selection for stable transfection was accomplished in the presence of 400 μg/ml G418. The resulting cells expressed high levels of IL-1 type I receptor and are referred to in the text as HEK293/IL1RI cells.

The GAS/κB (9-bp NF-κB) 5′-GATCCTTCTGGGAATTCCTAGATC-3′ used in Fig. 1 was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Antibodies obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology were as follows: anti-NH2-terminal STAT3α, anti-internal STAT3α, anti-COOH-terminal STAT3α, anti-p50, anti-p65, anti-STAT1, and anti-STAT3 phosphotyrosine 705. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays (EMSAs)—EMSAs were performed essentially as described previously (18.Koyama Y. Tanaka Y. Saito K. Abe M. Nakatsuka K. Morimoto I. Auron P.E. Eto S. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 5097-5103PubMed Google Scholar, 19.Tsukada J. Waterman W.R. Koyama Y. Webb A.C. Auron P.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2183-2194Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Briefly, 10 μg of whole cell extracts or nuclear extracts was preincubated for 20 min at room temperature in 15 μl of buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 4% glycerol, 40 mm NaCl) containing 1 μg of poly(dI-dC), and each oligonucleotide was labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) and [γ-32P]ATP (6,000 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Protein-DNA complexes were resolved on 4% TBE polyacrylamide gels and analyzed with or without specific antibody or nonlabeled hSIE oligonucleotide. DNA Constructs—Luciferase reporter plasmids were constructed containing the sequences used as EMSA probes (see above) inserted upstream (between unique KpnI and NheI sites) of the minimal (–56 to +109) murine c-fos promoter (20.Gilman M.Z. Wilson R.N. Weinberg R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 4305-4316Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar), which had previously been inserted into the pGL3 Basic promoter (Promega, Madison, WI). The GAS/κB reporter used for most of the studies harbored four copies of the 24-bp oligonucleotide containing the 9-bp κB sequence described, above, under “Oligonucleotides and Antibodies.” These four sequences are separated by spacers of 12, 32, and 12 bp in order from the upstream-toward the downstream-most element. An additional 59 bp separates the last element from the–56 position of the c-fos promoter. The hSIE GAS reporter contained two copies of the oligonucleotide described, above, spaced 13 bp apart and separated from the c-fos promoter by 47 bp. The 4spC-like GAS reporter contained a single copy of the above described oligonucleotide located 94 bp upstream of the c-fos promoter. The wild-type and mutated GAS/κB reporters described in Fig. 4 each contained two copies of the same sequence located 47 bp upstream of the c-fos promoter. The MHCκB reporter (MHCκB-luc) was from Dr. T. Born (21.Born T.L. Thomassen E. Bird T.A. Sims J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29445-29450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar) and contained four tandem copies of the described oligonucleotide located 3 bp upstream of the c-fos promoter. IL-8 reporter (IL-8-luc) was provided by Dr. T. A. Libermann, which contains the IL-8 promoter region from –1481 to +40 as reported by Zhao et al. (22.Zhao D. Keates A.C. Kuhnt-Moore S. Moyer M.P. Kelly C.P. Pothoulakis C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44464-44471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). TRAF6 vectors were constructed by inserting PCR-amplified cDNA fragments into the pcDNA3.1 expression vector (Invitrogen). The creation of the COOH-terminal FLAG-tagged, v-Src myristoylation signal-TRAF6 fusion expression vectors used pFLAG-CMV-5a (Sigma) as a parent vector to which was added the v-Src myristoylation sequence (23.Dadgostar H. Cheng G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2539-2544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) along with HindIII, XhoI, and NotI restriction sites (5′-GAAAGCTTCTCGAGAATACCATGGGTAGCAACAAGAGCAAGCCCAAGGATGCCAGCCAGCGGGGGGCGGCCGCTAAA-3′). This double stranded oligonucleotide was introduced into the HindIII/NotI site of the parent vector. Each TRAF mutant was constructed using PCR and appropriate primers and introduced into the NotI/BglII site of the vector. The cDNA for STAT3 was purchased (Invitrogen) and was inserted into pcDNA3.1. The mutant STAT3 at tyrosine 705 (mSTAT3) was made by PCR-based point mutation methods. The dominant negative IκBα was purchased (Upstate, Waltham, MA). The pCI p50 and p65 plasmids were provided by Dr. P. Oettgen. All plasmids used for transfections were prepared by means of the EndoFree Plasmid Maxi Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Transfections and Luciferase Assays—Cells were transfected with the transfection reagent FuGENE6 (Roche Applied Science) at 3 μl of reagent/μg of DNA according to the manufacturer's instructions. A total of 0.15–0.5 μg of DNA, including the luciferase reporter construct, expression vectors, and 0.01 μg of pRL-TK-RLuc (Promega), was added to about 90% confluent cells in 24-well tissue culture plates. The total amount of transfected DNA was adjusted to be constant in each experiment. At 24 h after transfection, cells were stimulated with or without 2 ng/ml of IL-1β (Cistron Biotechnology, Pine Brook, NJ) or 50 ng/ml IL-6 (Upstate, Waltham, MA). After an additional 3-h incubation, cells were lysed with Passive Lysis Buffer (Promega). The cytosolic fractions were used for a dual luciferase reporter assay system (Promega). Transfection efficiency was monitored by use of the internal control. Immunoblots—For preparation of whole cell lysis, cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer with 10 mg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, aprotinin, proteinase inhibitors (Complete™, EDTA-free; Roche Applied Science). Nuclear extracts were prepared using a kit (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The protein amount for each sample was measured using a Bradford assay (Bio-Rad) and adjusted to be equal in all samples. Immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis with enhanced chemiluminescent detection (SuperSignal WestFemto System, Pierce) were carried out by standard methods (24.Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, New York1994Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE was run with 40% acrylamide using a 29:1 ratio of acrylamide to bisacrylamide. Molecular weight standards (Bio-Rad) were used for determining molecular mass. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP)—Hep3B cells were grown in 100 × 20-mm plates to 75% confluence and were treated with 10 ng/ml IL-1β and 50 ng/ml IL-6. After 15 min, ChIP was performed using a kit from Upstate USA. In brief, proteins of both treated and untreated cells were cross-linked to DNA by adding 37% formaldehyde to a final concentration of 1% for 15 min. Cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma), scraped, and washed three times. Cells were lysed with 300 μl of SDS-lysis buffer containing protease inhibitor, and DNA was sonicated (10 W on a Fisher model 100 Sonic Dismembrator for 18 × 5 s to generate 200–1,000-bp lengths), and samples were centrifuged at 12,000 rpm × 8 min. Sonicated cell supernatant was diluted 10-fold with ChIP dilution buffer (Upstate USA). Immunoclearing was accomplished by incubating with sheared salmon sperm DNA and protein A/G-Sepharose. Samples were rotated at 4 °C for 30 min and incubated with specific antibodies overnight. Sepharose beads were harvested by centrifugation (3,000 rpm × 3 min) and washed with ChIP wash buffer (Upstate). Beads were incubated with proteinase K for 45 min. DNA was eluted from the beads with elution buffer (1% SDS, 0.1 m NaHCO3), and then DNA cross-links were reversed by incubating the sample 4 h to overnight at 65 °C in 0.2 m NaCl. Final purification of DNA used a PCR minielute kit (Qiagen) followed by PCR amplification using specific primers and Fast Start Taq polymerase (Roche Applied Science). The PCR amplification conditions were 4 min at 94 °C followed by 27 cycles of 30 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 54 °C, and 45 s at 72 °C. Synthesis was terminated by incubation for 15 min at 72 °C. The human IL-8 gene primers were TGCCATTAAAAGAAAATCATCCA (–359/–337 sense strand) and CCTTATGGAGTGCTCCGGT (+10/–9 antisense strand). IL-1 Induces a STAT3·p65 Complex to Bind DNA—It is known that IL-1β induces the transcription of many genes via members of the REL(NF-κB) family of transcription factors. The REL factors, such as p50, p52, p65, c-Rel, RelA, and RelB, function as dimers and have been shown to be both differentially activated (25.Thompson J. Phillips R. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Ghosh S. Cell. 1995; 80: 573-582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar, 26.Han Z. Ip Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21355-21361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 27.Yamazaki S. Muta T. Takeshige K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27657-27662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar) and to possess distinct target DNA binding site specificities (28.Chen Y. Ghosh S. Ghosh G. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 67-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 29.Kunsch C. Rosen C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 137-146Crossref Google Scholar) that depend upon dimer composition. The p50 and p52 proteins do not possess a transactivation domain (TAD) and can either inhibit as homodimers or potentiate the activity of other REL factors upon heterodimerization. Fig. 1 demonstrates that Hep3B cells treated for 15 min with IL-1β contain inducible DNA-binding complexes, the nature of which depends upon the sequence of the DNA probe (Fig. 1B and 1C, lanes 1 and 2). One probe contains a well characterized 10–11-bp-long KBF1/H2TF1 κB site (MHCκB) from the murine major histocompatibility complex class I locus enhancer that is known to be a good binding site for p50-containing REL family dimers (30.Scheinman R. Beg A. Baldwin A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6089-6101Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The other has a GAS-like STAT factor binding site that overlaps a κB motif and is closely related to a sequence derived from the rat α2-macroglobulin gene (Fig. 1A). The 9-bp-long κB sequence in this probe is similar to that which was shown to be capable of binding NF-κB p65 homodimers strongly (28.Chen Y. Ghosh S. Ghosh G. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 67-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). A fast migrating complex (complex I) was associated with both probes and reacted completely with either anti-p50 or p65 antibody and is likely a p50/p65 heterodimer (Fig. 1B, lanes 7 and 8, and 1C, lanes 3 and 4). The GAS/κB probe, but not the MHCκB probe, also generated a more slowly migrating complex (complex II) that was, surprisingly, recognized by antibodies specific for p65 and two STAT3 epitopes (the COOH-terminal transcription activation domain and the internal SH2 domain), but not by antibodies specific for p50, STAT1, and the NH2-terminal protein-protein interaction (31.Zhang X. Darnell J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33576-33581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) domain of STAT3 (Fig. 1B, lanes 3–8). Unexpectedly, Complex II did not bind to an hSIE GAS oligonucleotide known to be a consensus sequence for STAT3 homo- and heterodimers (Fig. 1B, lane 9). As expected, EMSA analysis using the hSIE GAS probe revealed that, in contrast to IL-6, IL-1 could not induce STAT3 binding (data not shown). Interestingly, complex II could only be detected to bind MHCκB probe after very long exposure to film (not shown), arguing that the NF-κB site in the MHCκB probe binds only p50/p65 heterodimers strongly. It is unclear why there is an absence of an effect for N-STAT3 antibody (Fig. 1B, lane 5). All the antibodies were tested independently on EMSA using extracts from IL-6-treated Hep3B cells and a labeled hSIE probe (not shown). The EMSA revealed the expected three complexes corresponding to STAT3 and STAT1 homo- and heterodimers. All the antibodies reacted with the appropriate complexes, except for N-STAT3, which reacted with the STAT3 homodimer complex, but not with that corresponding to the STAT1/STAT3 heterodimer. It is not known whether this is because the antibody recognizes the likely complex that occurs between STAT amino termini or whether there is a distinct conformational change for the heterodimer. Because complex II appeared to be completely dependent upon both p65 and STAT3, we looked for a protein-protein interaction between these two proteins. Following IL-1 stimulation, cell lysates were prepared and immunoprecipitated with either anti-p65 or anti-STAT3 antibodies. Fig. 1D shows that STAT3 is coimmunoprecipitated with p65, suggesting that p65 interacts with STAT3 in vivo. The above results show that p65 can make a complex with STAT3 both in vitro, in the presence, and in vivo, in the absence of DNA. This complex binds to an overlapping GAS/κB motif, but not to the MHCκB sequence, which does not reveal any obvious GAS-like sites. STAT3 and p65 Cooperate Functionally on a Specific DNA Binding Site—To characterize functionally the in vitro DNA binding, we prepared luciferase reporter constructs containing multiple copies of various binding sites positioned immediately upstream of the murine c-fos core promoter. These included reporters containing the GAS/κB and MHCκB sequences, as well as consensus GAS sequences such as the hSIE and 4spC, which are devoid of any obvious κB-like motifs. These constructs were transfected into Hep3B cells, and luciferase activity was assayed in response to stimulation with either IL-1 or IL-6 (Fig. 2A). Treatment of Hep3B cells with IL-1 resulted in strong activity for the GAS/κB and MHCκB-luc reporters, but not for the two GAS-luc reporters. This activity appeared to be dependent upon NF-κB, as judged by its sensitivity to inhibition by overexpression of a mutated form of IκBα, which serves as a strong NF-κB dominant negative (dn-IκB in Fig. 2A). In contrast, IL-6 strongly activated the two GAS-luc reporters, but only weakly activated GAS/κB-luc. As expected, the MHCκB-luc reporter did not respond to IL-6. Fig. 1B shows that STAT3 was induced by IL-1 to bind to the GAS/κB sequence as an apparent complex with NF-κB p65. Therefore, we investigated whether the expression of STAT3 could induce the GAS/κB-luc reporter. Fig. 2B shows that STAT3 alone, as expected, could not induce GAS/κB-luc. This is in contrast to what was observed for cotransfection with an expression vector coding for NF-κB p65. This is probably the result of an expression level that exceeds that of the endogenous IκB inhibitors. Coexpression of both STAT3 and p65 resulted in a cooperative response. Interestingly, this cooperativity appeared to be independent of IL-6 stimulation as well as the ability of STAT3 to be tyrosine-phosphorylated, as judged by the activity of a nonphosphorylatable Y705F mutation in STAT3 (mSTAT3). To confirm that the product of the Y705F mutated STAT3 expression vector was not tyrosine-phosphorylated, the vector was cotransfected along with the GAS-luc reporter. Fig. 2C shows that the Y705F mutation resulted in dominant negative activity for the GAS-luc reporter, as reported previously (32.Wen Z. Zhong Z. Darnell Jr, J.E. Cell. 1995; 82: 241-250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1743) Google Scholar, 33.Kapstein A. Paillard V. Saunders M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5961-5964Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). It is well known that the IL-6-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 is necessary for dimerization and DNA binding. The observation that STAT3aPTyr can cooperate with p65 suggests that tyrosine phosphorylation is not necessary for formation of the STAT3·p65 complex. The cooperative behavior between STAT3 and p65 was only observed for GAS/κB-luc, not MHCκB-luc. The results shown in Fig. 2D argue that IL-1 could neither efficiently tyrosine phosphorylate STAT3, nor interfere with tyrosine phosphorylation by IL-6. This argues that IL-1 inhibition of GAS site activation during APR is not likely via induction of SOCS3 (34.Bode J. Nimmesgern A. Schmitz J. Schaper F. Schmitt M. Frisch W. Haussinger D. Heinrich P. Graeve L. FEBS Lett. 1999; 463: 365-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), a Janus kinase inhibitor that mediates LPS- and TNF-dependent inhibition of STAT3. The observation that pretreatment of Hep3B cells with IL-1 inhibits IL-6 induction of a GAS-luc reporter, while not having an effect on STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation, argues that SOCS3 is probably not involved in the observed activity inhibition. p65 Inhibits, Whereas p50 Activates, a GAS-dependent Promoter—The observation that IL-1 induces the formation of a functionally cooperative interaction between p65 and STAT3aPTyr on a composite GAS/κB-luc reporter, while inhibiting the activation of a GAS-luc reporter, prompted investigation of how different forms of NF-κB might affect the induction of a GAS-dependent reporter. Fig. 3 shows that cotransfection of expression vectors for either the p65 or p50 form of NF-κB resulted in distinct responses for a GAS-luc reporter. As expected, only IL-6 (and not IL-1, p50, and p65) induced transcription from the GAS-luc reporter. Expression of p65 inhibited the IL-6-dependent activity, whereas p50 cooperated with IL-6. As a positive control, expression of STAT3 in the presence of IL-6 revealed strong activity. These data argue that the activation of p65 by IL-1 may be responsible for both the inhibition of GAS-dependent genes as well as the observed cooperativity for the GAS/κB-luc reporter. Furthermore, it appears that TAD-deficient p50, in contrast to p65, can cooperate with IL-6 to activate a STAT3-dependent reporter containing APR class 2 GAS sites. Cooperativity between STAT3 and p65 Depends upon the Binding of p65 to DNA—The observation that the composite GAS/κB sequence, in contrast to that of Ig-κB, both binds and functionally cooperates with STAT3, taken together with the observation that STAT3 and p65 can interact in the absence of DNA (Fig. 1D), suggests that either the presence of the GAS motif or differences between the nature of the two different κB sequences may be responsible for the observed specificities. In an attempt to evaluate the importance of the intact GAS site in the overlapping GAS/κB sequence, mutations were introduced into the nonoverlapping portion of each half-site (Fig. 4A). Fig. 4B shows that mutation of the κB (mNFκB), but not the GAS (mGAS) half-site eliminates formation of both DNA-binding complexes. In contrast, mutation of the GAS half-site has no effect on DNA binding. To confirm this, the same sequences used as EMSA probe were incorporated into luciferase reporters and assayed for activity. Fig. 4C shows that IL-1 activates both the wild-type and mGAS-luc but not mNFκB-luc, which is cons"
https://openalex.org/W2046226087,"The possibility that certain integral plasma membrane (PM) proteins involved in Ca2+ homeostasis form junctional units with adjacent endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in neurons and glia was explored using immunoprecipitation and immunocytochemistry. Rat brain membranes were solubilized with the mild, non-ionic detergent, IGEPAL CA-630. Na+/Ca2+ exchanger type 1 (NCX1), a key PM Ca2+ transporter, was immunoprecipitated from the detergent-soluble fraction. Several abundant PM proteins co-immunoprecipitated with NCX1, including the α2 and α3 isoforms of the Na+ pump catalytic (α) subunit, and the α2 subunit of the dihydropyridine receptor. The adaptor protein, ankyrin 2 (Ank 2), and the cytoskeletal proteins, α-fodrin and β-spectrin, also selectively co-immunoprecipitated with NCX1, as did the ER proteins, Ca2+ pump type 2 (SERCA 2), and inositol-trisphosphate receptor type 1 (IP3R-1). In contrast, a number of other abundant PMs, adaptors, and cytoskeletal proteins did not co-immunoprecipitate with NCX1, including the Na+ pump α1 isoform, PM Ca2+ pump type 1 (PMCA1), β-fodrin, and Ank 3. In reciprocal experiments, immunoprecipitation with antibodies to the Na+ pump α2 and α3 isoforms, but not α1, co-immunoprecipitated NCX1; the antibodies to α1 did, however, co-immunoprecipitate PMCA1. Antibodies to Ank 2, α-fodrin, β-spectrin and IP3R-1 all co-immunoprecipitated NCX1. Immunocytochemistry revealed partial co-localization of β-spectrin with NCX1, Na+ pump α3, and IP3R-1 in neurons and of α-fodrin with NCX1 and SERCA2 in astrocytes. The data support the idea that in neurons and glia PM microdomains containing NCX1 and Na+ pumps with α2 or α3 subunits form Ca2+ signaling complexes with underlying ER containing SERCA2 and IP3R-1. These PM and ER components appear to be linked through the cytoskeletal spectrin network, to which they are probably tethered by Ank 2.

Immunocytochemistry revealed partial co-localization of β-spectrin with NCX1, Na+ pump α3, and IP3R-1 in neurons and of α-fodrin with NCX1 and SERCA2 in astrocytes. The data support the idea that in neurons and glia PM microdomains containing NCX1 and Na+ pumps with α2 or α3 subunits form Ca2+ signaling complexes with underlying ER containing SERCA2 and IP3R-1. These PM and ER components appear to be linked through the cytoskeletal spectrin network, to which they are probably tethered by Ank 2. Cytosolic Ca2+ plays a key role as a second messenger in all cells and is responsible for regulating numerous cellular processes simultaneously. Spatial as well as temporal control of the cytosolic Ca2+ signals is therefore critical (1.Bootman M.D. Lipp P. Berridge M.J. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2213-2222Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2.Blaustein M.P. Golovina V.A. Trends Neurosci. 2001; 24: 602-608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Much of the “signal Ca2+” comes from intracellular stores, primarily in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). 1The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; Ank, ankyrin; CaSCs, Ca2+ signaling complexes; DHPR, dihydropyridine receptor; IP, immunoprecipitate; IP3R, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor; jER, junctional ER; mAb, monoclonal antibody; N-CAM, neural cell adhesion molecule; NCX, Na+/Ca2+ exchanger; pAb, polyclonal antibody; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PM, plasma membrane; PMCA, ATP-driven PM Ca2+ pump; SERCA, SR/ER Ca2+ pump; SOCs, store-operated channels; SR, sarcoplasmic reticulum; Trk B, a neurotrophin receptor; TRPC, transient receptor potential channel protein; PIPES, piperazine-N,N′-bis(2-ethanesulfonic acid; NCX1, Na+/Ca2+ exchanger type 1. Nevertheless, Ca2+ signaling depends critically upon the coordination of Ca2+ entry across the plasma membrane (PM), Ca2+ release from the ER, Ca2+ extrusion across the PM, and refilling of the ER stores by resequestration and by entry from the extracellular fluid (1.Bootman M.D. Lipp P. Berridge M.J. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2213-2222Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2.Blaustein M.P. Golovina V.A. Trends Neurosci. 2001; 24: 602-608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Clearly, the many specific mechanisms responsible for all these Ca2+ movements must be coordinated precisely. One possibility is that several functionally inter-dependent mechanisms may be clustered and organized into specialized “Ca2+ signaling complexes” (CaSCs). Indeed, recent results suggest that PM microdomains, adjacent “junctional” ER (jER), and the intervening tiny volume of cytosol (units we have called “PLasm-ERosomes”) (2.Blaustein M.P. Golovina V.A. Trends Neurosci. 2001; 24: 602-608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) serve as CaSCs in many types of cells (3.Juhaszova M. Blaustein M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1800-1805Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 4.Juhaszova M. Blaustein M.P. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1997; 834: 524-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 5.Arnon A.

Protasi F. Ramesh V. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1998; 853: 20-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Structurally similar PM-SR or PM-ER junctions have been observed by electron microscopy in smooth muscle (9.Somlyo A.V. Franzini-Armstrong C. Experientia (Basel). 1985; 41: 841-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and neurons (10.Henkart M. Landis D.M. Reese T.S. J. Cell Biol. 1976; 70: 338-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 11.Watanabe H. Burnstock G. J. Neurocytol. 1976; 5: 125-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), even though Ca2+ signaling in these cells involves some different Ca2+ transporters. The Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (NCX) is a Ca2+ transporter that helps to control intracellular and jER Ca2+ concentrations and cell signaling in many types of cells (12.Blaustein M.P. Lederer W.J. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 763-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (1454) Google Scholar). All three isoforms (NCX1-3), each the product of a different gene, are expressed in the brain (13.Thurneysen T. Nicoll D.A. Philipson K.D. Porzig H. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 2002; 107: 145-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). NCX1 is the most widely distributed isoform and is prevalent in both neurons and glia (13.Thurneysen T. Nicoll D.A. Philipson K.D. Porzig H. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 2002; 107: 145-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 14.Papa M. Canitano A. Boscia F. Castaldo P. Sellitti S. Porzig H. Taglialeta M. Annunziato L. J. Comp. Neurol. 2003; 461: 31-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The activity of the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger is driven by the Na+ electrochemical gradient across the PM and appears to be functionally linked to Na+ pumps with α2 or α3 catalytic subunits in neurons, glia, and other cell types (5.Arnon A. Hamlyn J.M. Blaustein M.P. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: H679-H691Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7.Golovina V.A. Song H. James P.F. Lingrel J.B. Blaustein M.P. Am. J.

Physiol. 2001; 281: R917-R925Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, these particular Na+ pumps indirectly modulate Ca2+ signaling. Moreover, immunocytochemical evidence indicates that the NCX and Na+ pumps with α2 or α3 subunits are confined to PM microdomains that overlie jER (or SR) in neurons, astrocytes, and smooth muscle cells (3.Juhaszova M. Blaustein M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1800-1805Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 4.Juhaszova M. Blaustein M.P. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1997; 834: 524-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In contrast, Na+ pumps with α1 catalytic subunits and the ATP-driven PM Ca2+ pump (PMCA) are more uniformly distributed on the surfaces of these cells (3.Juhaszova M. Blaustein M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1800-1805Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 4.Juhaszova M. Blaustein M.P. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1997; 834: 524-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The Na+ pumps with α1 subunits apparently are “housekeepers” that maintain low cytosolic Na+ concentrations, whereas those with α2 or α3 subunits, expressed in the same cells, likely regulate Ca2+ signaling (7.Golovina V.A. Song H. James P.F. Lingrel J.B. Blaustein M.P. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: C475-C486Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Immunocytochemical evidence (17.Golovina V.A. Biophys. J. 2002; 82: 61Google Scholar) suggests that store-operated channels (SOCs), which mediate Ca2+ entry and ER refilling following ER Ca2+ store depletion (18.Putney Jr., J.W. Ribeiro C.M. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2000; 57: 1272-1286Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19.Montell C. Birnbaumer L. Flockerzi V. Cell. 2002; 108: 595-598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar), also are located in the PM microdomains at PM-ER junctions. These SOCs may therefore form part of the CaSCs that also include NCX1 and Na+ pumps with α2 or α3 subunits. Here we test the idea that the integral membrane proteins in the CaSCs are concentrated into distinct membrane domains and junctional complexes. How are the PM microdomains and PM-jER complexes organized? Involvement of the cytoskeleton in this organization is suggested by the evidence that both the NCX and Na+ pumps bind to the adaptor protein, ankyrin (20.Nelson W.J. Hammerton R.W. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 893-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 21.Li Z.P. Burke E.P. Frank J.S. Bennett V. Philipson K.D. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 18681-18684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Ankyrins also associate with ER proteins such as the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor, IP3R (23.Joseph S.K. Samanta S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6477-6486Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the SR/ER Ca2+ pump, SERCA (24.Tuvia S. Buhasi M. Davis L. Reedy M. Bennett V. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 995-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), and bind to the cytoskeletal protein spectrin (25.Bennett V. Chen L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 61-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 26.Ursitti J.A. Martin L. Resneck W.G. Chaney T. Zielke C. Alger B.E. Bloch R.J. Brain Res. Dev.

We hypothesized that the cytoskeleton might form a scaffold to link the relevant PM and adjacent ER transporters. To test this possibility, we used immunoprecipitation (IP) and immunoblotting to isolate and partially characterize the protein complexes from brain homogenates. Immunocytochemistry was used to verify the co-localization of some of these proteins in the complexes in cultured neurons and astrocytes. The results provide new insight into the structural organization of PM-ER junctions that underlies critical aspects of the spatial regulation of neuronal and glial Ca2+ signaling. A preliminary report of some of these findings has been published (28.Lencesova L. Blaustein M.P. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 466Google Scholar). Preparation of Tissue Extracts—Brains from Sprague-Dawley rats (males, 150-200 g) were minced in NaCl/sucrose buffer (∼1 mg/5 ml) containing 140 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 10 mm sodium azide, 20 mm Tris base, pH 7.4, 0.25 m sucrose, and protease inhibitor mixture tablets (Roche Diagnostics). The suspension was homogenized at 4 °C with a Polytron homogenizer (Brinkmann Instruments) and subjected to centrifugation for 20 min at 27,000 × g and 4 °C. The pellet from this centrifugation step was resuspended in ∼15 ml of NaCl/sucrose buffer containing the non-ionic detergent, IGEPAL CA-630 (1%) (Sigma), and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. The lysate was centrifuged for 20 min at 27,000 × g and 4 °C. The supernatant (detergent extract or “Homogenate”), ∼3.3 mg of protein/ml, was stored at -70 °C and used for immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting. The protein concentration was determined with the bicinchoninic acid assay (Bio-Rad), with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Immunoprecipitation—Appropriate monoclonal antibodies (mAb; 3 μg) or polyclonal antibodies (pAb; ∼6 μg) were incubated with ∼2 × 107 (50 μl) washed magnetic beads (Dynabeads M-450, coated with goat anti-mouse IgG or M-280 sheep anti-rabbit IgG; Dynal Biotech, Lake Success, NY) overnight at 4 °C on a rotator (see manufacturer's directions). As negative controls, the coated beads were incubated with either mouse IgG1κ (MOPC-21; Sigma) for mAb, or with rabbit γ-globulin (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) for pAb raised in rabbits. The beads, with antibody attached, were washed (twice, 200 μl) with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Proteins were immunoprecipitated from 1 mg of detergent-extracted total protein by incubation for 4 h at 4 °C with antibody-bound beads. Following incubation, the supernatant was frozen and later used for immunoblotting. Bead complexes were washed with (4 times 400 μl) PTA (145 mm NaCl, 10 mm NaH2PO4, 10 mm sodium azide, and 0.5% Tween 20, pH 7.0). Immunoprecipitated proteins were then extracted with 50 μl of 2× Laemmli Sample Buffer (Bio-Rad) (29.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207227) Google Scholar) and boiled for 5 min. In a few instances, the proteins were extracted by heating to 42 °C for 15 min (stated in figure legends). Immunoblotting—Proteins were solubilized in Laemmli Sample Buffer containing 5% 2-mercaptoethanol and were separated on 7.5 or 4-20% linear gradient polyacrylamide minigels (Bio-Rad). For immunoblotting, proteins were then transferred electrophoretically to nitrocellulose or polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Amersham Biosciences). The membranes were blocked in 5% non-fat dry milk in TBS-T (137 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.6, with 0.1% Tween 20) overnight at 4 °C and then incubated for 1 h with appropriate primary antibody. Following washing, membranes were incubated with secondary antibodies to rabbit IgG (for pAb) or mouse IgG (for primary mAb), conjugated to horseradish peroxidase, for 1 h at room temperature. An enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (ECL+Plus; Amersham Biosciences) was used to detect bound antibody in most experiments (see “Results”). Similar results also were obtained with a more sensitive detection system, SuperSignal-West Femto (Pierce). Antibodies—Antibodies raised against the following proteins were used: NCX1 (R3F1 mAb, a gift from K. D. Philipson, UCLA); Na+ pump α1, α2, and α3 (subunit isoform-specific pAbs, gifts from T. A. Pressley, Texas Tech University Health Science Center, Lubbock, TX; and A. McDonough, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, and generated for us by Sigma Genosys, The Woodlands, TX; Ref. 30.Pressley T.A. Am. J.

Wojcikiewicz, State University of New York Syracuse Health Science Center, Syracuse, NY); IP3R-3 (mAb from BD Transduction Laboratories); ankyrin 2 and ankyrin 3 (mAb from Zymed Laboratories Inc., San Francisco, CA); α-fodrin (αII-spectrin; Ref. 31.Malchilodi-Albedi F. Ceccarini M. Winkelmann J.C. Morrow J.S. Tamara C. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 106: 67-78PubMed Google Scholar)), β-fodrin (βII-spectrin), and β-spectrin (βI-spectrin; rabbit and chicken pAb; Ref. 26.Ursitti J.A. Martin L. Resneck W.G. Chaney T. Zielke C. Alger B.E. Bloch R.J. Brain Res. Dev. Brain Res. 2001; 129: 81-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar); Trk B (a neurotrophin receptor; mAb from BD Biosciences); N-CAM (neural cell adhesion molecule, mAb from University of Iowa Hybridoma Bank, Iowa City, IA); homer 1 and homer 2 (pAbs, gifts from P. Worley, The Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD); and TRPC-4 (transient receptor potential channel protein, pAb from Alomone Labs, Jerusalem, Israel). Quantitative Analysis of Immunoblots—Immunoblots were scanned, and band densities were analyzed and quantified using a Kodak DC120 digital camera and 1D Image Analysis Software (Eastman Kodak Co.). The densities of specific bands from the post-IP supernatant (IP S in Fig. 1) were compared with the densities of the bands from the original detergent extract (Homog in Fig. 1). This ratio (IP S/Homog) measures the fraction of that protein extracted by the IP. Primary Culture of Neurons and Astrocytes—Cortical neurons, cultured from embryonic day (E) 16-17-day mouse brains (32.Bading H. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1991; 253: 912-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar), were kindly provided by P. Murray and B. K. Krueger (University of Maryland, Baltimore). Cortical astrocytes were cultured from E18-19-day rat brains (33.Booher J. Sensenbrenner M. Neurobiology. 1972; 2: 97-105PubMed Google Scholar). The neurons and astrocytes were used after 6-10 days in culture. Immunocytochemistry—Primary cultured mouse neurons were washed with PBS at 22 °C and fixed for 10 min in ice-cold methanol. The fixed neurons on the coverslips were rinsed 3 times with PBS, permeabilized with 0.25% Triton X-100 in PBS, and rinsed 3 more times with PBS. After blocking nonspecific binding with 10% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 1 h, the neurons were incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies diluted in Antibody Buffer (0.5 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 20 mm NaN3, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4). The neurons were then washed 3 times with PBS and incubated for 1 h at 22 °C with fluorescently labeled secondary antibodies (Alexa 586-labeled antimouse or anti-rabbit antibodies from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR) for NCX1, the α3 subunit of the Na+ pump, or IP3R-1, and fluoresceinlabeled donkey anti-chicken antibody for β-spectrin). The neurons were then washed again in PBS, and the coverslips were mounted with Vectashield (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Primary cultured rat astrocytes were fixed for 45 min at 22 °C with 0.45% (w/v) paraformaldehyde in fixation solution (75 mm cyclohexylamine (free base), 75 mm NaCl, 10 mm EGTA, 10 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm PIPES adjusted to pH 6.8 with HCl). The cells on the coverslips were then permeabilized with fresh fixative containing 0.5% Brij 58 (Sigma) for 10 min. The coverslips were washed with washing solution (75 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm NaN3, pH 6.7) for 2 h. Nonspecific cross-reactivity was blocked by incubating the cells for 4 h in 5% normal donkey serum (Jackson ImmunoResearch) diluted with Antibody Buffer. The antibodies diluted in Antibody Buffer were applied to the coverslips overnight at 4 °C. The coverslips were then washed in 3 changes of Antibody Buffer (30 min each) for 1.5 h and probed (4 h, 22 °C) with secondary antibodies labeled with the appropriate fluorochrome (Alexa 586 or Cy3; Molecular Probes). Following washing in Antibody Buffer, the coverslips were mounted with Vectashield. Immunoprecipitation of the NCX1 from a Detergent-soluble Extract of Rat Brain Membranes—Ca2+ homeostasis in most cells depends upon two PM Ca2+ transporters, the PMCA (34.Strehler E.E. Zacharias D.A. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 21-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar) and the NCX (12.Blaustein M.P. Lederer W.J. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 763-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (1454) Google Scholar). The NCX1 isoform, which is prevalent in neurons and glia (see Introduction), appears to be confined to membrane microdomains that form junctional complexes with the adjacent ER (3.Juhaszova M. Blaustein M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1800-1805Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 4.Juhaszova M. Blaustein M.P. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1997; 834: 524-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Moreover, NCX activity modulates ER-dependent Ca2+ signaling (2.Blaustein M.P. Golovina V.A. Trends Neurosci. 2001; 24: 602-608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). To learn if NCX1 forms a complex with elements of the ER, and if these junctional structures contain cytoskeletal structures capable of linking them together, we prepared immunoprecipitates of NCX1 from detergent-solubilized extracts of rat brain membranes. Immunoblots were performed on these IPs to identify other proteins that co-IP with, and may therefore associate with, NCX1 (Figs. 1 and 2). Immunoprecipitation removed a large fraction (about 73%) of the NCX1 from the detergent extract. Fig. 1A shows that the density of the dominant NCX1 band (140 kDa in this immunoblot) 2NCX1 protein has a molecular mass of 120 kDa. Following boiling, however, the protein sometimes runs as a 140-kDa band (35.Santacruz-Toloza L. Ottolia M. Nicoll D.A. Philipson K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 182-188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). in the post-IP, detergent-soluble supernatant (IP S) fraction was only about 27% of the band density in the original homogenate (Homog; n = 4 different IPs). For controls, the Dynabeads were coated with nonspecific mAb (MOPC-21 = MOPC). No NCX1 bound to these beads. As a result, the NCX1 band in the post-IP, detergent-soluble fraction in this control sample was comparable in density to that in the homogenate. Some PM proteins co-IP to a significant extent with NCX1 (Fig. 1B), notably the α2 and α3 (catalytic) subunits of the Na+ pump and the α2 subunit of the L-type voltage-gated Ca2+ channel (DHPR α2). TRPC-4 protein, a component of some store-operated channels (36.Hofmann T. Schaefer M. Schultz G. Gudermann T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7461-7466Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar), was also observed in the IP, although to a lesser extent (not shown; see Table I). In marked contrast, several other neuronal and glial PM proteins that also are prevalent in the detergent extract did not co-IP with NCX1 (Fig. 1B). These include the α1 isoform of the Na+ pump, PMCA1, Trk B (two isoforms at 95 and 145 kDa), and N-CAM (two isoforms at 140 and 180 kDa). These differences are exemplified by the relative densities of the protein bands detected in immunoblots of IPs generated with anti-NCX1. For example, the band densities of the α2 and α3 isoforms of the Na+ pump and the α2 subunit of the DHPR in the post-IP supernatant (IP S) were reduced by about 24, 63, and 49% (means of 2-3 IPs), respectively, compared with the band densities in the original detergent extract (Homog). In contrast, the Na+ pump α1 isoform, PMCA1, Trk B, and N-CAM were not significantly reduced. The fact that these proteins were prevalent in the detergent extract, but absent from the IPs generated with anti-NCX1, confirms the specificity of the interactions detected by co-IP and serves as an additional control. These and our other co-IP data (Figs. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9) are summarized in Table I.Table ISummary of co-immunoprecipitation data The data from Figs. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and similar experiments (including some results mentioned in the text but not shown in the figures) are summarized. The left-hand column lists the antibodies that were used to test for proteins that Co-immunoprecipitated with the proteins indicated at the top of columns 2-9; all of these proteins were prevalent in the original homogenates (see Figs. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9). Cross-reactivity: ++, very strong; +, strong; ±, weak; -, none; X indicates the immunoprecipitated protein, and a blank indicates that the antibody was not tested.

FGF treatment inhibits the proliferation of chondrocytes both in vitro and in vivo, but the signaling pathways involved have not been clearly identified. In this report we show that both the MEK-ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK pathways, but not phospholipase Cγ or phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, play a role in FGF-mediated growth arrest of chondrocytes. Chemical inhibitors of the MEK1/2 or the p38 MAPK pathways applied to rat chondrosarcoma (RCS) chondrocytes significantly prevented FGF-induced growth arrest. The retinoblastoma family members p107 and p130 were previously shown to be essential effectors of FGF-induced growth arrest in chondrocytes. The dephosphorylation of p107, one of the earliest events in RCS growth arrest, was significantly blocked by MEK1/2 inhibitors but not by the p38 MAPK inhibitors, whereas that of p130, which occurs later, was partially prevented both by the MEK and p38 inhibitors. Furthermore, by expressing the nerve growth factor (NGF) receptor, TrkA, and the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor, ErbB1, in RCS cells we show that NGF treatment of the transfected cells caused growth inhibition, whereas EGF did not. FGF- and NGF-induced growth inhibition is accompanied by a strong and sustained activation of ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK and a decrease of AKT phosphorylation, whereas EGF induces a much more transient activation of p38 and ERK1/2 and increases AKT phosphorylation. These results indicate that inhibition of chondrocyte proliferation by FGF requires both ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK signaling and also suggest that sustained activation of these pathways is required to achieve growth inhibition.

Development of most skeletal elements occurs through the multistep process of endochondral ossification, in which a cartilage template is converted into bone. Chondrocytes transit through maturational stages of proliferation, prehypertrophy, and hypertrophy within the epiphyseal growth plate and eventually undergo apoptosis. FGF signaling inhibits endochondral bone growth by regulating the proliferation and differentiation of chondrocytes (4.Ornitz D.M. Marie P.J. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1446-1465Crossref PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar). Gain of function mutations of FGF receptor 3 (FGFR3), which is expressed in growth plate chondrocytes, cause several forms of human dwarfism (4.Ornitz D.M. Marie P.J.

Genet. 1996; 12: 390-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar). In line with this genetic evidence, we showed previously (8.Sahni M. Ambrosetti D.C. Mansukhani A. Gertner R. Levy D. Basilico C. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1361-1366Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 9.Sahni M. Raz R. Coffin J.D. Levy D. Basilico C. Development. 2001; 128: 2119-2129Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that FGF inhibits proliferation of chondrocytes both in vivo and in vitro and that this phenomenon requires STAT1 function. Furthermore, we established that two members of the retinoblastoma (Rb) protein family, p107 and p130, but not pRb, are essential downstream mediators of FGF-induced growth arrest in chondrocytes (10.Laplantine E. Rossi F. Sahni M. Basilico C. Cobrinik D. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 741-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The function Rb proteins is regulated by phosphorylation (11.Dyson N. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2245-2262Crossref PubMed Scopus (1971) Google Scholar), and a very early event in the growth arrest of chondrocytes following FGF treatment is the rapid dephosphorylation of p107, which took place even in the absence of new RNA or protein synthesis (12.Dailey L. Laplantine E. Priore R. Basilico C. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 1053-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). FGFs activate a complex network of signaling and transcriptional events in chondrocytes leading to growth arrest (8.Sahni M. Ambrosetti D.C. Mansukhani A. Gertner R. Levy D. Basilico C. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1361-1366Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 9.Sahni M. Raz R. Coffin J.D. Levy D. Basilico C.

Although the studies summarized above identified STAT1 and Rb proteins as essential mediators of FGF-induced chondrocyte growth arrest, the signal transduction pathways that utilize STAT1 or lead to dephosphorylation of Rb proteins have not been clearly identified. FGF binding to its cognate receptors induces receptor tyrosine kinase activation and transphosphorylation of the receptor dimers. The phosphorylated tyrosines function as binding sites for Src homology domain 2 or phosphotyrosine binding domains of a variety of downstream signaling enzymes and adaptor proteins (14.Klint P. Claesson-Welsh L. Front. Biosci. 1999; 4: D165-D177Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15.Schlessinger J. Cell. 2000; 103: 211-225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3537) Google Scholar). A key component of FGF signaling is the docking protein FRS2, which binds to the FGFRs and recruits several signal transducing molecules leading to the activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade and the PI3K-AKT antiapoptotic pathway (16.Kouhara H. Hadari Y.R. Spivak-Kroizman T. Schilling J. Bar-Sagi D. Lax I. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1997; 89: 693-702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar, 17.Hadari Y.R. Kouhara H.

A. 2001; 98: 6074-6079Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). The MAPKs are focal points for diverse extracellular stimuli and regulate the activities of kinases or transcription factors downstream, thereby influencing gene expression and cellular responses (19.Hagemann C. Blank J.L. Cell. Signal. 2001; 13: 863-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). The MAPK family includes the following: 1) extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK1 and ERK2); 2) c-Jun N-terminal or stress-activated protein kinases; and 3) the p38 kinases α, β, γ, and δ (20.Chen Z. Gibson T.B. Robinson F. Silvestro L. Pearson G. Xu B. Wright A. Vanderbilt C. Cobb M.H. Chem. Rev. 2001; 101: 2449-2476Crossref PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells the Ras-Raf-MEK1/2-ERK1/2 cascade is activated by growth factors and is implicated in cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival (21.English J. Pearson G. Wilsbacher J.

Eiden L.E. Science. 2002; 296: 1648-1649Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar). Unlike the ERK signaling pathway, p38 and JNK are preferentially activated by inflammatory cytokines and cellular stresses, but recent studies have demonstrated that p38 is also activated by several growth factors including FGFs (25.Ono K. Han J. Cell. Signal. 2000; 12: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (1393) Google Scholar, 26.Harper S.J. LoGrasso P. Cell. Signal. 2001; 13: 299-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 27.Matsumoto T. Turesson I. Book M. Gerwins P. Claesson-Welsh L. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 149-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Although many JNK/p38-activating stimuli are proapoptotic, the biological outcome of JNK/p38 activation is highly divergent and appears to be largely dependent on the cell type (28.Ichijo H. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6087-6093Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). In this report we have investigated the role that FGF activation of MAPK signal transduction pathways plays in chondrocyte growth arrest. We show that ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK play a role in the FGF-induced growth arrest of RCS chondrocytes. By introducing exogenous receptors for NGF (TrkA) and EGF (ErbB1) into RCS cells, we could also show that NGF treatment causes growth arrest, whereas EGF does not. Both the FGF- and NGF-induced RCS growth arrest are accompanied by a strong and prolonged activation of ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK, whereas treatment with EGF activates ERKs and p38 only transiently. These findings indicate that both p38 MAPK and ERK signalings are required for the inhibition of the proliferation of chondrocytes induced by FGFs and suggest that the duration and the strength of ERK1/2 and p38 activation play a role in this process. Reagents and Antibodies—Antibodies against PLCγ1, JNK1, phospho-JNK1/2, ERK2, TrkA, EGFR were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Antibodies against phospho-p38 MAPK, p38 MAPK, phospho-AKT, AKT, phospho-p44/42 MAPK, p44/42 MAPK were from Cell Signaling Technology. Anti-phospho-tyrosine 4G10 was from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. The antibody anti-EGFR was a generous gift from Dr. J. Schlessinger (Yale University). The horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse and anti-rabbit secondary antibodies were purchased from Promega Inc. Anti-BrdUrd monoclonal antibody was from Amersham Biosciences (RPN-202). Antimouse secondary antibody Cy3-conjugated was from The Jackson Laboratories. p38 MAPK Assay Kit was from Cell Signaling Technology (catalog number 9820). MEK1/2 inhibitors (PD98059 and U0126) were from Cell Signaling Technology. p38 MAPK inhibitors (SB202190 and SB203580) and PLCγ inhibitor (U73122) were from Calbiochem. Mouse nerve growth factor (NGF) was purchased from Harlam. Human recombinant epidermal growth factor (EGF) was from Intergen. Cell Culture—Rat chondrosarcoma (RCS) cells were maintained as monolayer cultures in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) as described previously (29.Mukhopadhyay K. Lefebvre V. Zhou G. Garofalo S. Kimura J.H. de Crombrugghe B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27711-27719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). RCS expressing TrkA (RCS/TrkA), RCS expressing EGFR (RCS/ErbB1), and 293 gag-pol-expressing cells were cultured under the same conditions. Cloning and Retroviral Infections—TrkA cDNA was subcloned into pLXSN retroviral expression vector that contains a neomycin resistance gene. The cDNA was cut from pCMV/TrkA expression vector (gift from Dr. M. Chao, New York University), by restriction digestion with EcoRI and cloned into pLXSN generating pLXSN/TrkA. The pLXSN/ErbB1 retroviral expression vector was a gift from Dr. J. Schlessinger (Yale University). 293 gag-pol-expressing cells were used for production of retroviruses. Cells were plated at 60% confluency in 100-mm plates and cotransfected with 5 μg of pLXSN/TrkA or pLXSN/ErbB1 plasmids and 5 μg of pCMV-VSV-G plasmid by calcium phosphate precipitation (30.Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4821) Google Scholar). The following day the medium was changed, and 48 h later the viral supernatant was collected. About 2 × 105 RCS cells were infected with 1 ml of viral supernatant in the presence of 8 μg/ml Polybrene for 5 h. The cells were selected with geneticin G418 (600 μg/ml) (Sigma) for 2 weeks. Protein expression of TrkA or ErbB1 was further analyzed. Pools of selected cultures were used in the studies. Proliferation Assay—2 × 104 cells were seeded onto glass coverslips in 24-well plates (Costar) for 48 h in DMEM containing 10% FCS. Recombinant human FGF1 and heparin (Sigma, 10 μg/ml), NGF, or EGF were added for 20 h at the indicated concentrations, and the cells were labeled with 1 μg/ml bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd; Sigma) for 4 h at 37 °C. The cells were fixed in 3.7% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature, permeabilized for 10 min with 0.5% Triton in phosphate-buffered saline, and treated for 15 min with 1.5 n HCl. After several washes, analysis of BrdUrd incorporation was performed using an anti-BrdUrd monoclonal antibody (Amersham Biosciences) followed by anti-mouse secondary antibody conjugated with Cy3 (1:400). Cell nuclei were stained with a solution of 0.5 μg/ml of Hoechst (Sigma) in phosphate-buffered saline for 20 min prior to mounting on slides. The fluorescence was visualized using an Axioplan 2 Zeiss microscope equipped with a digital camera. The frequency of S phase cells was calculated as a ratio of BrdUrd-positive nuclei to the total Hoechststained nuclei. Growth Factor Stimulation and Cell Lysate Preparation—RCS cells were starved overnight in DMEM and stimulated for the indicated times and at the indicated concentrations at 37 °C with FGF1 and heparin, NGF, or EGF in DMEM. After stimulation, cells were washed once with cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed either in RIPA buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.1% SDS, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Triton X-100) or HNTG buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 750 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 105 glycerol, 1% Triton X-100) in the presence of protease and phosphatase inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm sodium fluoride). Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. Protein concentration was determined by the Bradford methods (Bio-Rad). Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot Analysis—500 μg of protein extract was immunoprecipitated with specific antibodies and 40 μl of Protein A Plus-agarose (Oncogene Science) over night at 4 °C. The immunocomplexes were washed 3 times in lysis buffer and resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer. Immunoprecipitates or total protein extracts (20–30 μg) were boiled separately by SDS-PAGE and electrotransferred on nitrocellulose membranes (Protran®). The membranes were blocked in TBST (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 0.5 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) containing 3% bovine serum albumin (Sigma) or in TBST containing 5% dried milk. The blots were first probed with the indicated primary antibodies in 3% bovine serum albumin/TBST and then with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies in TBST. Proteins were visualized by ECL detection system (Amersham Biosciences). For proliferation assay and biochemical assay, the cells were pretreated with MEK1/2 inhibitors, PD98059 and U0126, and p38 MAPK inhibitors, SB202190 and SB203580, and the PLCγ inhibitor, U73122, for 1 h before addition of growth factors. All the compounds were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO). p38 MAPK Assay—The p38 kinase assay was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Cell Signaling). Treated cells were lysed (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate), and 20 μl of immobilized agarose phospho-p38 MAPK antibody was incubated with 400 μg of total protein lysate overnight at 4 °C. The immunocomplexes were washed twice with the lysis buffer and once with the kinase buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate). Immunoprecipitates were suspended in 50 μl of kinase buffer supplemented with 200 μm ATP and 2 μg of ATF-2 fusion protein and incubated for 30 min at 30 °C. The reaction was stopped with Laemmli sample buffer, and the samples were boiled for 5 min, separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and immunoblotted with an antibody anti-phospho-ATF2 (Thr-71). For our experiments we used the RCS cell line that displays numerous chondrocytic characteristics, including expression of type II, type IX, and type XI collagen and Alcian blue-stainable cartilage-specific proteoglycans (29.Mukhopadhyay K. Lefebvre V. Zhou G. Garofalo S. Kimura J.H. de Crombrugghe B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27711-27719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). We treated RCS cells with FGF1, a high affinity ligand for all known FGFR isoforms. In preliminary studies, we confirmed that RCS cells expressed FGFR3 and FGFR2, which are phosphorylated at tyrosine residues upon treatment with FGF1 (not shown). As reported previously (8.Sahni M. Ambrosetti D.C. Mansukhani A. Gertner R. Levy D. Basilico C. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1361-1366Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 10.Laplantine E. Rossi F. Sahni M. Basilico C. Cobrinik D. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 741-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 13.Aikawa T. Segre G.V. Lee K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29347-29352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), FGF1 treatment of RCS resulted in a drastic and dose-dependent growth inhibition, reflected in the reduction of the proportion of cells incorporating BrdUrd. Inhibition of DNA synthesis was rapid and reached a maximum by 16–20 h after treatment. FGF Stimulation of RCS Cells Leads to the Activation of ERK1/2, p38 MAPK, and PLCγ but Not JNK and AKT—To determine which of the signal transduction pathways activated by FGFR in RCS cells may contribute to the growth-inhibitory response, we studied the activation of known FGF signaling pathways, including those of the MAPK family, PI3K and PLCγ, in FGF-treated RCS cells. FGF1 (100 ng/ml) was added to RCS cells for different times, and cellular lysates were analyzed. Fig. 1A shows that FGF1 stimulation led to a strong phosphorylation of ERK1 and ERK2 that was detectable at 5 min and persisted up to 1 h. p38 MAPK was also phosphorylated upon FGF1 stimulation, whereas no activation of JNK1 (p46) and JNK2 (p54) was detected. To verify that the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK led to its activation, an in vitro kinase assay was performed. The transcription factor ATF-2 is a direct substrate for p38 MAPK in vitro and in vivo; therefore, its phosphorylation can serve as a measure of p38 activity (31.Livingstone C. Patel G. Jones N. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1785-1797Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). Fig. 1C shows that FGF1 is able to induce p38-mediated phosphorylation of ATF-2, which peaked at 15 min and decreased to basal levels in 3 h. The activation of PI3K induced by FGF1 in RCS cells was determined by analyzing the phosphorylation of AKT, a downstream effector of PI3K signaling (32.Franke T.F. Yang S.I. Chan T.O. Datta K. Kazlauskas A. Morrison D.K. Kaplan D.R. Tsichlis P.N. Cell. 1995; 81: 727-736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1828) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting using an antibody against the phosphorylation site (Ser-473) in AKT shows that FGF1 did not activate AKT (Fig. 1A). Untreated serum-starved cells exhibit a basal level of AKT phosphorylation that was slightly reduced after 15 min of FGF1 treatment. This result is in contrast with the finding that FGF strongly induces phosphorylation of AKT in fibroblasts (33.Mansukhani A. Bellosta P. Sahni M. Basilico C. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 1297-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). PLCγ is phosphorylated on tyrosine residues following binding to activated FGFRs (34.Mohammadi M. Honegger A.M. Rotin D. Fischer R. Bellot F. Li W. Dionne C.A. Jaye M. Rubinstein M. Schlessinger J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5068-5078Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PLCγ was immunoprecipitated from cellular lysates using an anti-PLCγ antibody followed by a Western blot using an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. As shown in Fig. 1B, FGF1 strongly activated PLCγ after 5 min of treatment. Thus, these results show that FGF1 stimulation of RCS leads to the activation of ERK1/2, p38 MAPK, and PLCγ but not JNK1/2 and to a decrease of the basal levels of phosphorylated AKT. MEK1/2 and p38 MAPK Inhibitors Block FGF-mediated Growth Arrest of RCS Cells—We used specific chemical inhibitors for ERK1/2, p38 MAPK, and PLCγ to determine their effect on FGF-induced growth arrest. The compounds used were the MEK1/2 inhibitors, U0126, PD98059, SB202190, and SB203580, which inhibit p38α and p38β MAPK, and the PLCγ inhibitor U73122. The MEK1/2 inhibitors selectively prevent the activation of MEK1/2 by Raf with a subsequent blocking of the ERK1/2 cascade. U0126 was shown to be able to inhibit both MEK1 and MEK2, whereas PD98095 inhibits MEK1 more potently than MEK2. SB202190 and SB203580 are able to block the kinase activity of p38α and p38β MAP kinases, and U73122 has been shown to inhibit PLCγ-associated phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate hydrolysis (35.Zapf-Colby A. Eichhorn J. Webster N.J. Olefsky J.M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 4908-4919Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 36.Davies S.P. Reddy H. Caivano M. Cohen P. Biochem.

The effect of MEK1/2 inhibitors on ERK1/2 activation and on RCS proliferation was tested. Treatment of RCS cells with PD98059 and U0126 produced a significant reduction in FGF1-induced ERK1/2 activation. A complete block of ERK1/2 phosphorylation was seen using 100 μm PD98059 and 20 μm U0126 (Fig. 3A and data not shown). These concentrations of the inhibitors were able to partially counteract the FGF-mediated growth arrest of RCS cells. BrdU incorporation in the presence of the inhibitors shows that the effect was detectable at concentrations of FGF1 ranging from 0.5 to 10 ng/ml (Fig. 2A).Fig. 2Effect of MEK1/2, p38 MAPK, and PLCγ inhibitors on FGF1-induced growth arrest of RCS cells. RCS cells were seeded on coverslips at a density of 2 × 104 cells/well (24-well plates) in DMEM containing 10% FCS. After 24 h, the medium was replaced with fresh medium, and the cells were treated with the indicated concentrations of MEK1/2 inhibitors (U0126 and PD98059) (A), p38 MAPK inhibitors (SB202190 and SB203580) (B), PLCγ inhibitor (U73122) (C), or with only Me2SO (DMSO) as a control. After 1 h FGF1 was added for 20 h. Cells were labeled with BrdU (5 μg/ml) for the last 4 h, fixed, and processed for immunofluorescent detection of BrdU incorporation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In order to determine whether p38α and p38β MAPKs also played a role in the response to FGF, we used two different concentrations of SB202190 and SB203580 (10 and 30 μm), which inhibited p38 by the effect on its target MAPKAP kinase-2 activity (data not shown) (38.Cuenda A. Rouse J. Doza Y.N. Meier R. Cohen P. Gallagher T.F. Young P.R. Lee J.C. FEBS Lett. 1995; 364: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (1980) Google Scholar, 39.Guay J. Lambert H. Gingras-Breton G. Lavoie J.N. Huot J. Landry J. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 357-368Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Both inhibitors were very effective at blocking the FGF1-mediated growth arrest with a maximal effect occurring at 30 μm (Fig. 2B). On the other hand, inhibition of PLCγ activity in the FGF-treated RCS cells using U73122, at concentrations of 1 and 5 μm, did not reverse the FGF-induced growth arrest (Fig. 2C). Inhibition of PI3K activity by wortmannin also had no effect on FGF-mediated growth arrest (data not shown). Thus, these results indicate that p38 MAPK and ERK1/2 signaling play a role in FGF-mediated growth arrest of RCS cells. The MEK1/2 Inhibitors Affect p38 MAPK Activity—Recent studies (40.Jun, T., Gjoerup, O., and Roberts, T. M. (1999) Science's STKE http:/www.stke.org/cgi/content/full/OC_sigtrans;1999/PE1Google Scholar) have shown that cross-talk between signaling cascades can modulate the response to growth factors. To determine whether inhibition of MEK1/2 could affect the activity of p38 and vice versa, we studied the phosphorylation pattern of ERK1/2, and the enzymatic activity of p38 MAPK in the absence and presence of a MEK1/2 inhibitor (U0126) and a p38 MAPK inhibitor (SB202190). As expected, FGF-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation was blocked by 20 μm U0126 but not by 20 μm SB202190, indicating that p38 MAPK is not required for ERK1/2 activation (Fig. 3A). We determined the effect of U0126 on p38 activity by an in vitro kinase assay using ATF-2 as substrate. Fig. 3B shows that the p38 activity induced by FGF1 was reduced in the presence of the MEK1/2 inhibitor, indicating that MEK1/2-ERK1/2 signaling can contribute to p38 MAPK activation or that the U0126 compound is not completely specific. Similar results were obtained with the PD98059 MEK1/2 inhibitor (data not shown). This result suggests that by using our experimental conditions, the ability of MEK1/2 inhibitors to prevent the FGF-induced growth arrest may depend in part on their effect on p38 MAPK activity. The ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK Pathways Are Involved in p107 and p130 Dephosphorylation—Laplantine et al. (10.Laplantine E. Rossi F. Sahni M. Basilico C. Cobrinik D. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 741-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) have shown that FGF treatment of RCS cells causes dephosphorylation of Rb family proteins and that p107 and p130 function is required for FGF-induced growth inhibition of chondrocytes in vitro and in vivo. Further data (12.Dailey L. Laplantine E. Priore R. Basilico C. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 1053-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) indicated that dephosphorylation of p107 and p130 is generated by different mechanisms and that p107 dephosphorylation is one of the earliest events in FGF-induced growth arrest of chondrocytes. We have studied the effect of the MEK1/2 and p38 MAPK inhibitors on the dephosphorylation of p107 and p130 induced by FGF in RCS cells. As shown in Fig. 4A, RCS cells contain a mixture of hyper- and hypophosphorylated p107 molecules that upon FGF treatment are rapidly converted to the hypophosphorylated form. This event is significantly prevented by the U0126 MEK1/2 inhibitor but not by the p38 inhibitor SB202190. The effect of the MEK1/2 inhibitor is clearly detectable at 1 h after FGF addition and persists up to 20 h. On"
https://openalex.org/W1988737089,"The signals used by insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) to stimulate proliferation in human mammary epithelial cells have been investigated. IGF-I caused the activation of both ERKs and Akt. Activation of ERKs was slower and more transient than that of Akt. ZD1839, a specific epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor, prevented activation of ERKs but not Akt by IGF-I. Inhibition of the EGFR with function-blocking monoclonal antibodies also specifically blocked IGF-I-induced ERK activation. These effects occurred in primary mammary epithelial cells and in two cell lines derived from normal mammary epithelium but not in mammary fibroblasts or IGF-I-responsive breast carcinoma cell lines. Although IGF-I stimulated the proliferation of both normal and carcinoma cell lines, ZD1839 blocked this only in the normal line. ZD1839 had no effect on IGF-I receptor (IGF-IR) autophosphorylation in intact cells. IGF-I-induced ERK activation was insensitive to a broad spectrum matrix-metalloproteinase inhibitor and to CRM-197, an inhibitor of the EGFR ligand heparin-bound epidermal growth factor. EGFR was detectable within IGF-IR immunoprecipitates from normal mammary epithelial cells. Treatment of cells with IGF-I led to an increase in the amount of tyrosine-phosphorylated EGFR within these complexes. ZD1839 had no effect on complex formation but completely abolished their associated EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation. These findings indicate that IGF-I utilizes a novel EGFR-dependent signaling pathway involving the formation of a complex between the IGF-IR and the EGFR to activate the ERK pathway and to stimulate proliferation in normal human mammary epithelial cells. This form of regulation may be lost during malignant progression."
https://openalex.org/W2037739709,"Necdin is a growth suppressor expressed predominantly in postmitotic neurons and implicated in their terminal differentiation. Necdin shows a moderate homology to the MAGE family proteins, the functional roles of which are largely unknown. Human genes encoding necdin, MAGEL2 (necdin-like 1), and MAGE-G1 (necdin-like 2) are located in proximal chromosome 15q, a region associated with neurodevelopmental disorders such as Prader-Willi syndrome, Angelman syndrome, and autistic disorder. The necdin and MAGEL2 genes are subjected to genomic imprinting and suggested to be involved in the etiology of Prader-Willi syndrome. In this study, we compared biochemical and functional characteristics of murine orthologs of these necdin-related MAGE proteins. The colony formation and bromodeoxyuridine incorporation analyses revealed that necdin and MAGE-G1, but not MAGEL2, induced growth arrest. Necdin and MAGE-G1 interacted with the transcription factor E2F1 via its transactivation domain, repressed E2F1-dependent transcription, and antagonized E2F1-induced apoptosis of N1E-115 neuroblastoma cells. In addition, necdin and MAGE-G1 interacted with the p75 neurotrophin receptor via its distinct intracellular domains. In contrast, MAGEL2 failed to bind to these necdin interactors, suggesting that MAGEL2 has no necdin-like function in developing brain. Overexpression of p75 translocated necdin and MAGE-G1 in the proximity of the plasma membrane and reduced their association with E2F1 to facilitate E2F1-induced death of neuroblastoma cells. These results suggest that necdin and MAGE-G1 target both E2F1 and p75 to regulate cell viability during brain development.

Necdin also contributes to the terminal differentiation of sensory neurons that are dependent on nerve growth factor (NGF) (11.Takazaki R. Nishimura I. Yoshikawa K. Exp. Cell Res. 2002; 277: 220-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Furthermore, necdin associates with the p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR) (12.Tcherpakov M. Bronfman F.C. Conticello S.G.

These observations suggest that necdin induces cell cycle arrest and controls neuronal apoptosis through interactions with E2F1 and p75NTR.The human necdin gene is mapped to chromosome 15q11-q12, a region deleted in Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) (14.Nakada Y. Taniura H. Uetsuki T. Inazawa J. Yoshikawa K. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 213: 65-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). PWS is a genomic imprinting-associated neurodevelopmental disorder, the major symptoms of which are feeding problems, gross obesity, and hypogonadism, suggesting abnormalities in hypothalamic neurons. The necdin gene is maternally imprinted, transcribed only from the paternal allele, and not expressed in individuals with PWS (15.Jay P. Rougeulle C. Massacrier A. Moncla A. Mattei M.G. Malzac P.

Wevrick R. Stewart C.L. Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 199-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), reduction in specific groups of hypothalamic neurons, and behavioral alterations, which are characteristics of the PWS phenotype (19.Muscatelli F. Abrous D.N. Massacrier A. Boccaccio I. Moal M.L. Cau P. Cremer H. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 3101-3110Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that necdin is responsible, at least in part, for the pathogenesis of PWS. On the other hand, the gene encoding MAGEL2 is located near the necdin gene and maternally imprinted (20.Boccaccio I. Glatt-Deeley H. Watrin F. Roeckel N. Lalande M. Muscatelli F. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 2497-2505Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 21.Lee S. Kozlov S. Hernandez L. Chamberlain S.J. Brannan C.I. Stewart C.L. Wevrick R. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 1813-1819Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Thus, it appears that MAGEL2 is also involved in the pathogenesis of PWS. More recently, another gene encoding novel necdin homologous protein MAGE-G1 (also designated necdin-like 2) has been mapped to proximal chromosome 15q (22.Chibuk T.K. Bischof J.M. Wevrick R. BMC Genet. 2001; 2: 22Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The proximal region of human chromosomal 15q is subject to genomic imprinting and implicated in various human neurological and mental disorders including PWS, Angelman syndrome, autism, epilepsy, and schizophrenia, all of which show the parent-of-origin effects (23.Isles A.R. Wilkinson L.S. Trends Cogn. Sci. 2000; 4: 309-318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that the necdin-related proteins are involved in brain development, and their abnormalities cause neurodevelopmental diseases. However, the biochemical and functional features of MAGEL2 and MAGE-G1 remain totally unknown at present.Here we characterize MAGEL2 and MAGE-G1 based on the known features of necdin, and demonstrate that MAGE-G1, but not MAGEL2, has characteristics similar to those of necdin such as growth suppression and interactions with E2F1 and p75NTR. The present findings suggest that other MAGE proteins with unknown function can be characterized using p75NTR and E2F1.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESDNAs and Plasmids—Mouse full-length MAGEL2 coding sequence was synthesized by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using mouse genomic DNA as a template and sets of primers flanking the coding region (20.Boccaccio I. Glatt-Deeley H. Watrin F. Roeckel N. Lalande M. Muscatelli F. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 2497-2505Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Mouse MAGE-G1 cDNA was isolated from a phage library of neurally differentiated P19 embryonal carcinoma cells as one of the cDNA clones that hybridized with human MAGE-F1 cDNA (kindly provided by Dr. B. Stone, Virginia Mason Research Center, Seattle, WA). DNAs encoding MAGEL2 (amino acids 1–490) and MAGE-G1 (amino acids 1–279) were subcloned into pBluescript (Stratagene), 6× Myc tag plasmid (kindly provided by Dr. M. McBurney, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada), and pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen). Mouse necdin cDNA was subcloned into pBluescript, pRc/CMV, and p3xFLAG-CMV14 (1.Maruyama K. Usami M. Aizawa T.

Chem. 2002; 277: 42128-42135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The sequences and homologies were analyzed by Gene-tyx-Mac version 11 software (Genetyx, Tokyo, Japan).RNA Blot Analyses—Total RNA was prepared from ICR strain mice at various developmental stages by the method of Chomczynski and Sacchi (24.Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62993) Google Scholar). Standard RNAs were synthesized in vitro with T7 RNA polymerase by transcription of the inserts for necdin, MAGEL2, and MAGE-G1 in pBluescript. For RNA dot blot analysis, known amounts of synthetic RNA and total RNA extracted from mouse tissues were blotted onto Hybond-N+ membrane (Amersham Biosciences) and fixed by UV irradiation. For Northern blot analysis, total RNA was electrophoresed on a 1% agarose gel containing 6% formaldehyde and blotted onto Hybond-N+ membrane. The membranes were incubated with DNA probes labeled with digoxigenin (DIG-High Prime kit, Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Hybridization was carried out as reported previously (25.Yoshikawa K. Hong J.S. Sabol S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 589-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) except for the hybridization temperature of 50 °C. The membrane was incubated with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-digoxigenin antibody (Roche), and detected by CDP-Star chemiluminescence detection system (Roche). The equality and integrity of total RNA were examined by staining RNA on the membrane with ethidium bromide.Cell Growth Analyses—The colony formation assay was carried out as described previously (6.Taniura H. Taniguchi N. Hara M. Yoshikawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 720-728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Briefly, SAOS-2 cells grown in 60-mm dishes were transfected with pcDNA3.1, pRc-necdin, pcDNA3.1-Myc-MAGEL2, and pcDNA3.1-Myc-MAGE-G1 (3 μg each) by the calcium phosphate method using a CellPhect transfection kit (Amersham Biosciences). The cells were treated with G418 (500 μg/ml) (Sigma) for 14 days, fixed, and stained with 0.4% crystal violet. Integrated densities of stained colonies were quantified with an image analyzer (LAS-1000plus, Fujifilm). For bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) incorporation assay, HEK293A cells grown on coverslips in 35-mm dishes were transfected with above vectors (1 μg each) and pRc-LacZ (1 μg) as described previously (9.Kobayashi M. Taniura H. Yoshikawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42128-42135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). BrdUrd (10 μm) was added 48 h after transfection, fixed 4 h later, and incubated with antibodies against β-galactosidase (Chemicon) (1:300) and BrdUrd (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) (1:30). The cells were then incubated with anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with fluorescein isothiocyanate (Cappel) (1:500) and anti-mouse IgG conjugated with rhodamine B (Cappel) (1:500). For chromosomal DNA staining, cells were incubated with 5 μm Hoechst 33342 (Sigma) for 10 min. Immunoreactive images were observed with a fluorescence microscope (BX50–34-FLAD1, Olympus), taken by CCD camera system (M-3204C, Olympus), and processed using Adobe Photoshop 5.0 software. Statistical significance was analyzed using Student's t test.Co-immunoprecipitation—For detection of E2F1 complexes, combinations of pRc-E2F1 (amino acids 1–430) (6.Taniura H. Taniguchi N. Hara M. Yoshikawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 720-728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), p3xFLAG-CMV14-necdin, pcDNA3.1-Myc-MAGEL2, pcDNA3.1-Myc-MAGE-G1, and empty pcDNA3.1 (5 μg each) were transfected into COS-7 cells by the calcium phosphate method. The cells were harvested 48 h after transfection and lysed in CSK buffer containing 10 mm PIPES (pH 6.8), 100 mm NaCl, 300 mm sucrose, 3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, and 1× protease inhibitor mixture (Roche). The lysates (200 μg) were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with antibodies against Myc (9E10) (1:4), E2F1 (C-20, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) (1:50), and FLAG (M2, Sigma) (1:50) in 200 μl of CSK buffer. The complexes were pelleted with protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences), separated by 10–12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE), and transferred to Immobilon membrane (Millipore) by electroblotting. The membranes were incubated with antibodies against E2F1 (1:500), FLAG (1:300), and Myc (1:10), washed, and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit and anti-mouse IgGs (Cappel). Proteins were visualized by chemiluminescence method (Western Lightning, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The p75NTR complexes in COS-7 cells transfected with pcDNA3.1-hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged human p75NTR (amino acids 1–427) (5 μg) (kindly provided by Dr. T. Yamashita, Osaka University) were detected with an anti-p75NTR antibody (Promega) (1:500). For detection of the p75NTR complexes in N1E-115 cells, combinations of p3xFLAG-CMV14-necdin (1 μg), pcDNA3.1-Myc-MAGE-G1 (2 μg), pRc-E2F1 (2 μg), and pcDNA3.1-HA-p75NTR (2 or 6 μg) were transfected using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen). The total amount of plasmids was adjusted to 10 μg/assay by adding empty pcDNA3.1 vector. The cells were cultured in the presence or absence of 2.5 S mouse NGF (100 ng/ml) (Invitrogen), treated 24 h later with 2% dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) to differentiate (9.Kobayashi M. Taniura H. Yoshikawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42128-42135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), and harvested 72 h after transfection. Cell lysates (400 μg) were incubated with antibodies against E2F1 (1:50) and p75NTR (1:50) in 200 μl of CSK buffer, and the complexes were detected with anti-FLAG and anti-Myc antibodies as above. The signal intensity was measured with the image analyzer. The protein concentration was determined by the Bradford method (Bio-Rad).In Vitro Binding—Maltose binding protein (MBP)-fused E2F1 proteins (amino acids 55–430, 55–338, and 383–430) were expressed in Escherichia coli and immobilized on amylose resin (New England Biolabs) (9.Kobayashi M. Taniura H. Yoshikawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42128-42135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Glutathione S-transferase (GST)-fused necdin (amino acids 1–325), MAGEL2 (amino acids 1–490), and MAGE-G1 (amino acids 1–279) were expressed using pGEX-5X-1(Amersham Biosciences) and purified with glutathione-agarose (Sigma). MBP-E2F1 fusions (1 μg each) on amylose resin (20 μl of 50% slurry) were incubated with purified GST-necdin, GST-MAGEL2, and GST-MAGE-G1 (100 ng each) at 4 °C for 30 min in in vitro binding buffer (0.5 ml) containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 200 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA. After the resin was washed with the buffer, bound proteins were eluted with 20 mm maltose. GST-necdin, GST-MAGEL2, and GST-MAGE-G1 were detected by Western blot analysis with an anti-GST antibody (Sigma) (1:5000). For analysis of binding domains of p75NTR, cDNAs encoding human p75NTR and its deletion mutants (amino acids 1–427, 1–341, 1–311, 1–274, and 340–418) were generated by PCR using synthetic oligonucleotide primers and cloned into pMAL-C2E (New England Biolabs). MBP-fused p75NTR proteins were incubated with GST-necdin and GST-MAGE-G1 as above.Reporter Assay—U2OS osteosarcoma cells were transfected with a luciferase reporter PGV-B vector containing the mouse c-Myc core promoter (P1–3) (26.Matsumoto K. Taniura H. Uetsuki T. Yoshikawa K. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 272: 173-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) (0.8 μg) in combination with pRc-E2F1, pRc-necdin, pcDNA3.1-Myc-MAGEL2, and pcDNA3.1-Myc-MAGE-G1. The total amount of plasmid DNA was adjusted to 4 μg by adding empty pcDNA3.1. Cells were cultured for 48 h and harvested to measure luciferase activity with a luminometer (Lumat LB9501, Berthold) using a reagent kit (Toyo Ink). Transfection efficiency was normalized with co-expressed pRc-LacZ (0.8 μg).Cell Death Analyses—N1E-115 cells were transfected with the expression vectors pRc-E2F1, pRc-necdin, pcDNA3.1-Myc-MAGEL2, pcDNA3.1-Myc-MAGE-G1 (1.5 μg each), and pRc-LacZ (1 μg) using LipofectAMINE 2000. The amount of plasmid DNA was adjusted to 4 μg by adding empty pcDNA3.1 vector. Cells were treated with Me2SO to differentiate 24 h after transfection, fixed 24 h later, and stained with the anti-β-galactosidase antibody and Hoechst 33342 (Sigma) (9.Kobayashi M. Taniura H. Yoshikawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42128-42135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Apoptotic cells carrying condensed or fragmented nuclei were counted. For lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) assay, N1E-115 were transfected with combinations of pRc-necdin (0.8 μg), pcDNA3.1-Myc-MAGEL2 (0.8 μg), pcDNA3.1-Myc-MAGE-G1 (0.8 μg), pRc-E2F1 (0.8 μg), and pcDNA3.1-HA-p75NTR (2.4 μg) using LipofectAMINE 2000. The amount of plasmid DNA was adjusted to 4 μg by adding empty pcDNA3.1. Transfected cells were cultured in the presence or absence of NGF (100 ng/ml), and induced to differentiate by Me2SO treatment 24 h after transfection. The conditioned medium was collected 72 h after transfection, and LDH activity was measured using the MTX LDH assay kit (Kyokuto) as described previously (27.Kuwako K. Nishimura I. Uetsuki T. Saido T.C. Yoshikawa K. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 2002; 107: 166-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). LDH activity (A560 of diformazan generated for 30 min at 37 °C) was obtained by subtracting the value of the culture medium of untransfected cells.Immunoaffinity Purification—P19 embryonal carcinoma cells were cultured and neurally differentiated with 5 × 10–7m all-trans-retinoic acid (Sigma) for 4 days (28.McBurney M.W. Jones-Villeneuve E.M. Edwards M.K. Anderson P.J. Nature. 1982; 299: 165-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). To enrich postmitotic neurons, retinoic acid-treated P19 cells were cultured in the presence of 5 μg/ml cytosine arabinoside (Sigma) for 7 days (29.Azuma-Hara M. Taniura H. Uetsuki T. Niinobe M. Yoshikawa K. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 251: 442-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Cells were lysed in CSK buffer, and the lysate (500 μg for necdin, 3 μg for MAGE-G1) was applied to HiTrap NHS-activated affinity column (Amersham Biosciences) coupled with IgG fractions of anti-necdin antiserum (NC243) (30.Niinobe M. Koyama K. Yoshikawa K. Dev. Neurosci. 2000; 22: 310-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), anti-MAGE-G1 antiserum, and pre-immune rabbit serum. Bound proteins were eluted with 0.1 m glycine-HCl (pH 2.5), precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid, rinsed with cold acetone, and separated by 10% SDS-PAGE. Proteins were detected by Western blot analysis with antibodies against E2F1 (1:500), p75NTR (1:500), necdin (NC243) (1:3000), and MAGE-G1 (1:300). An anti-MAGE-G1 antibody was raised in a New Zealand White rabbit against purified MBP-MAGE-G1 (amino acids 1–279) fusion protein.Translocation Analyses—P19 cells treated with retinoic acid were double-stained for necdin with NC243 and chromosomal DNA with Hoechst 33342 as described previously (2.Aizawa T. Maruyama K. Kondo H. Yoshikawa K. Brain Res. Dev. Brain Res. 1992; 68: 265-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 11.Takazaki R. Nishimura I. Yoshikawa K. Exp. Cell Res. 2002; 277: 220-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The images were captured with the CCD camera attached to the fluorescence microscope. N1E-115 cells grown on coverslips in 35-mm dishes were transfected with expression vectors (2 μg each) for p3xFLAG-necdin, Myc-MAGE-G1, Lac-Z, E2F1, and HA-p75NTR using LipofectAMINE 2000. Cells were induced to differentiate 24 h after transfection, fixed 72 h later, and incubated with the antibodies against FLAG, Myc, β-galactosidase, E2F1, and p75NTR. Immunofluorescence images were obtained by confocal laser scanning microscopy (LSM5 PASCAL, Carl Zeiss).RESULTSExpression of the Necdin-related Genes in Mouse Brain— Mouse MAGEL2 and MAGE-G1 encoded in the cloned DNAs consist of 490 and 279 amino acids, respectively, and their primary structures are consistent with those reported previously (20.Boccaccio I. Glatt-Deeley H. Watrin F. Roeckel N. Lalande M. Muscatelli F. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 2497-2505Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 22.Chibuk T.K. Bischof J.M. Wevrick R. BMC Genet. 2001; 2: 22Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). MAGE-G1 is more homologous to necdin than MAGEL2; The degrees (percentage of identity) of overall protein sequences are as follows: necdin versus MAGEL2, 23.5; necdin versus MAGE-G1, 33.5; MAGEL2 versus MAGE-G1, 24.7. The homology domains of necdin, MAGEL2, and MAGE-G1 are located at amino acids 116–280, 272–436, and 73–238, respectively. The degrees (percentage of identity) of the homology domains are as follows: necdin versus MAGEL2, 32.1; necdin versus MAGE-G1, 39.8; MAGEL2 versus MAGE-G1, 41.3.We examined the expression of mRNAs for necdin, MAGEL2, and MAGE-G1 in the mouse tissues in vivo using their DNAs as hybridization probes (Fig. 1A). These probes hybridized with their corresponding synthetic RNAs with similar intensities, and the detection limits were ∼10 pg. By the dot blot analysis, necdin and MAGEL2 mRNAs were detectable in the brain at E14 and P70, but MAGEL2 mRNA was undetectable. The abundances of necdin mRNA in several brain samples were 5–10 times those of MAGE-G1 mRNA (data not shown). By Northern blot analysis using these probes, a ∼1.7-kb necdin mRNA was readily detected in the brain and very weakly in the ovary at P70, whereas a ∼1.7-kb MAGE-G1 mRNA was detected in all the tissues examined (Fig. 1B). The levels of MAGE-G1 mRNA in the brain, testis, and ovary were higher than those in other organs. We then analyzed the mRNA expression at various stages of brain development (Fig. 1C). The levels of necdin mRNA were relatively high at late embryonic stages (E16 and E18) and decreased thereafter, whereas those of MAGE-G1 mRNA in the brain remained relatively constant. On the other hand, MAGEL2 mRNA, for which the predicted size is ∼2.5 kb (20.Boccaccio I. Glatt-Deeley H. Watrin F. Roeckel N. Lalande M. Muscatelli F. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 2497-2505Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), was undetectable by Northern blotting in any tissues at P70 and at any stage of brain development, consistent with the previous report (20.Boccaccio I. Glatt-Deeley H. Watrin F. Roeckel N. Lalande M. Muscatelli F. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 2497-2505Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). We failed to detect a ∼4.5-kb MAGEL2 mRNA species reported previously (21.Lee S. Kozlov S. Hernandez L. Chamberlain S.J. Brannan C.I. Stewart C.L. Wevrick R. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 1813-1819Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar).Growth Suppression by the Necdin-related Proteins—Because necdin exerts a strong suppressive effect on the growth of various cell lines, we employed the SAOS-2 colony formation assay to examine whether MAGEL2 and MAGE-G1 suppress cell growth. Necdin and MAGE-G1 reduced the colony densities to 31 and 35% of the control level (transfected with the empty vector), respectively, whereas MAGEL2 showed no significant reduction (Fig. 2, A and B). We also examined the effects of these proteins on the proliferation of HEK293A cells by BrdUrd incorporation assay (Fig. 2C). Necdin and MAGE-G1 significantly reduced the number of BrdUrd-positive S-phase cells among β-galactosidase-positive cells to 37 and 43%, respectively, of the control level (Fig. 2D). In contrast, MAGEL2 exerted no significant effect on cell growth. Together, these results suggest that MAGE-G1, like necdin and unlike MAGEL2, facilitates growth arrest.Fig. 2Effects of necdin-related MAGE proteins on growth arrest. A, colony formation assay. SAOS-2 cells were transfected with expression vectors for necdin (Necdin), Myc-MAGEL2 (L2), and Myc-MAGE-G1 (G1). Cells were cultured in the presence of G418 for 14 days, and G418-resistant colonies were stained with crystal violet. Vector, empty pcDNA3.1. B, quantification of the colony density. Integrated densities of stained colonies of transfected SAOS-2 cells are presented (mean ± S.E., n = 4). *, p < 0.001, significantly different from the control vector value. C, BrdUrd incorporation assay. HEK293A cells were transfected with pRc-LacZ plus each expression vector, cultured for 48 h, and incubated with BrdUrd for 4 h. Transfected cells were triply stained for β-galactosidase (β-Gal), BrdUrd (BrdUrd), and chromosomal DNA (Hoechst). Note the reduced BrdUrd immunoreactivity in β-galactosidase-positive cells co-transfected with cDNAs for necdin and MAGE-G1 (arrows). Scale bar, 20 μm. D, quantification of BrdUrd-positive cells. BrdUrd-positive HEK293A cells (%) among >100 β-galactosidase-positive cells were counted (mean ± S.E., n = 4). *, p < 0.001, significantly different from the control vector value.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Physical Interactions of the Necdin-related Proteins with E2F1—To examine whether MAGEL2 and MAGE-G1 associate with E2F1, we employed the co-immunoprecipitation assay using transfected COS-7 cells (Fig. 3). E2F1 was co-immunoprecipitated with FLAG-necdin (49 kDa) and Myc-MAGE-G1 (46 kDa), but not with Myc-MAGEL2 (71 kDa) (Fig. 3A).

Glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) phosphorylates four serine residues in the COOH terminus of glycogen synthase. Phosphorylation of one of these residues, Ser640 (site 3a), causes strong inactivation of glycogen synthase. In previous work, we demonstrated in cell models that site 3a can be phosphorylated by an as yet unidentified protein kinase (3a-kinase) distinct from GSK-3. In the present study, we purified the 3a-kinase from rabbit skeletal muscle and identified one constituent polypeptide as HAN11, a WD40 domain protein with unknown function. Another polypeptide was identified as DYRK1A, a member of the dual-specificity tyrosine phosphorylated and regulated protein kinase (DYRK) family. Two isoforms of DYRK, DYRK1A and DYRK1B, co-immunoprecipitate with HAN11 when coexpressed in COS cells indicating that the proteins interact in mammalian cells. Co-expression of DYRK1A, DYRK1B, or DYRK2 with a series of glycogen synthase mutants with Ser/Ala substitutions at the phosphorylation sites in COS cells revealed that protein kinases cause phosphorylation of site 3a in glycogen synthase. To confirm that DYRKs directly phosphorylate glycogen synthase, recombinant DYRK1A, DYRK2, and glycogen synthase were produced in bacterial cells. In the presence of Mg-ATP, both DYRKs inactivated glycogen synthase by more than 10-fold. The inactivation correlated with phosphorylation of site 3a in glycogen synthase. These results indicate that protein kinase(s) from the DYRK family may be involved in a new mechanism for the regulation of glycogen synthesis.

These results indicate that protein kinase(s) from the DYRK family may be involved in a new mechanism for the regulation of glycogen synthesis. Glycogen is the main storage form of glucose in mammals and plays an important role in whole body glucose metabolism. For example, a substantial proportion of ingested glucose is converted to muscle glycogen (1.Jue T. Rothman D.L. Tavitian B.A. Shulman R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. U. S.

Med. 1990; 322: 223-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (1022) Google Scholar). The rate of muscle glycogen synthesis is determined by its entry into muscle and the phosphorylation state of glycogen synthase, both of which processes are controlled by insulin (3.Lawrence J.C.

The muscle isoform of glycogen synthase is phosphorylated at nine or more sites by multiple protein kinases (for reviews see Refs. 4.Skurat A.V. Roach P.J. LeRoith D. Olefsky J.M. Taylor S.I.

Phosphorylation leads to inactivation of glycogen synthase, but activity can be restored by the allosteric activator glucose 6-phosphate. In rabbit skeletal muscle glycogen synthase, the critical phosphorylation sites that control the enzyme activity are NH2-terminal residues Ser7 (site 2) and Ser10 (site 2a) and COOH-terminal residues Ser640 (site 3a) and Ser644 (site 3b) (7.Flotow H.

It was proposed that phosphate serves as part of the recognition determinant for GSK-3 in the sequence motif -S-X-X-X-S(P)- (14.Fiol C.J. Mahrenholz A.M. Wang Y. Roeske R.W. Roach P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 14042-14048Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a hypothesis that has been reinforced by the recent solution of the crystal structure of GSK-3 (15.Dajani R. Fraser E.

However, we also demonstrated that, for glycogen synthase expressed in COS cells and Rat1 fibroblasts, disruption of the recognition sequence for GSK-3 by Ser/Ala substitution at sites 3c, 4, and/or 5 did not preclude inactivation of the enzyme (9.Skurat A.V.

Our work has shown also that sites 3a and 3b can be directly phosphorylated by as yet unidentified protein kinases (10.Skurat A.V. Roach P.J. J. Biol.

In the present study, we purified a protein kinase that specifically phosphorylates site 3a in glycogen synthase (3a-kinase). We identified the 3a-kinase catalytic subunit as a member of the DYRK (dual specificity tyrosine phosphorylated and regulated kinase) family of protein kinases. The protein kinase isolated from muscle is oligomeric and also contains a WD domain protein called Han11. Control of glycogen synthase by DYRK represents a novel mechanism, and a potentially novel pathway, for the regulation of glycogen synthesis. Construction of Expression Vectors and Site-directed Mutagenesis— The cDNA for rabbit muscle glycogen synthase was subcloned into the pCMV-4 expression vector as described previously (19.Skurat A.V. Cao Y. Roach P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14701-14707Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and was designated pCMV-GS. Construction of the vector containing the mutation in the cDNA for glycogen synthase that changes amino acid 7 (site 2) from serine to alanine was described earlier (9.Skurat A.V. Wang Y. Roach P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25534-25542Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and was designated pCMV-GS(site 2). To construct the vectors for expression of rabbit skeletal muscle glycogen synthase in Escherichia coli a novel NdeI site was introduced at the initiator ATG by site-directed mutagenesis using PCR with pCMV-GS and pCMV-GS(site 2) as templates. The PCR-generated fragments of wild type and mutated (site 2) glycogen synthase were digested with both NdeI and AsuII, then combined with the AsuII/BamHI fragment from pCMV-GS and ligated into NdeI/BamHI-digested pET-23a vector to generate pET-GSBam and pET-GS(site 2)Bam, respectively. In these vectors, the cDNA for glycogen synthase encodes amino acid residues from Met1 to Arg303. To make a truncated protein, the GAC codon for Asp683 was replaced by the TGA stop codon in pCMV-GS vector as described previously (10.Skurat A.V. Roach P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12491-12497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The cDNA for truncated glycogen synthase was digested with BamHI, and the 1.1-kb fragment was ligated into BamHI-cut pET-GSBam to produce pET-GSΔ vector. The pCMV-4-based constructs for expression of truncated glycogen synthase, which additionally contains phosphorylation site mutations, were described previously (10.Skurat A.V. Roach P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12491-12497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Three glycogen synthase mutants, S640A,S644A,S648A,S652A,S656AΔ682 (AAAAAΔ682), S644A,S648A,S652A,S656AΔ682 (SAAAAΔ682), and S640A,S648A,S652A,S656AΔ682 (ASAAAΔ682) (see Ref. 10.Skurat A.V.

Chem. 1995; 270: 12491-12497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), in which the indicated Ser residues were changed into Ala, were digested with BamHI and the 1.1-kb fragments were ligated into BamHI-cut pET-GS(site 2)Bam to produce pET-2,AAΔ, pET-2,SAΔ, and pET-2,ASΔ, respectively (the mutants structure is shown in Fig. 1). HAN11 was amplified by PCR from the EST clone AA442821 using two primers (5′-TGAGAATTCCATATGTCCCTGCACGGCAAACGGAAGGAGATC-3′ and 5′-AGTGTCGACTCGAGCTACACTCTGAGTATCTCCAGGCAGTTGTTG-3′). To construct pGBDU-HAN11, the 1-kb PCR fragment was digested with EcoRI and SalI and cloned into EcoRI/SalI-cut pGBDU-C2 vector (20.James P. Halladay J. Craig E.A. Genetics. 1996; 144: 1425-1436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To construct pET32-HAN11, pGDBU-HAN11 was digested with EcoRI and SalI, and the 1-kb fragment encoding HAN11 was ligated into pET32a (Novagen), which had been previously cut with EcoRI and SalI. The resulting vector encodes a fusion protein that contains, starting from the NH2 terminus, a Trx tag (thioredoxin), a His6 tag, an S-tag and HAN11. To construct a fusion protein containing an NH2-terminal His6 tag, an S-tag followed by HAN11, we used PCR with two primers (5′-TCCCGGGAAAAATGTCTCACCATCATCATCATCATTC-3′ and 5′-AGTGTCGACTCGAGCTACACTCTGAGTATCTCCAGGCAGTTGTTG-3′) and pET32-HAN11 as template. This PCR product was digested with SmaI and XhoI and ligated into the pcDNA vector (Invitrogen), which had been cut with HindIII, blunt-ended, and cut with XhoI. The resulting plasmid was designated pcDNA-S-HAN11. The SCAN11 gene (chromosome XVI open reading frame YPL247C) was cloned from the genome of yeast strain PJ69-4A by amplification of a 1.6-kb fragment using primers 5′-GAATTCCATATGGATCCCTTTCACAATGGCAAT-3′ and 5′-AGATCTGTCGACTCAAAGGACGCGGACGTTTTGAAA-3′. This product was cut with EcoRI and SalI and ligated into EcoRI/SalI-cut pGBDU-C2 vector to generate pGBDU-SCAN11. Human DYRK2 was amplified by PCR from the EST clone AW665190 using two primers (5′-GCGGCCGCAGAATTCATGAATGATCACCTGCATGTCGG-3′ and 5′-AGATCTGTCGACTCAGCTAACAAGTTTTGGCAACACTG-3′). To construct pFLAG-DYRK2, the 1.8-kb PCR product was digested with NotI and SalI and inserted into NotI/-SalI-cut pFLAG-CMV-2 (Sigma). To construct pGEX-DYRK2, the 1.8-kb PCR fragment was digested with EcoRI and SalI and inserted into pGEX-4T1 (Pharmacia), which had been cut with same restriction endonucleases. The 1.9-kb fragment containing the cDNA for splice variant b of human DYRK1B (Ref. 21.Leder S. Weber Y. Altafai X. Estivill X. Joost H.G. Becker W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 254: 474-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, GenBank™ accession number NP_006474) was excised from EST clone BE907785 by StuI and ligated into the pFLAG-CMV-2 vector that had been cut with HindIII and blunt-ended and into the pGBDU-C3 vector that had been cut with EcoRI and blunt-ended. The resulting constructs, which both contain an additional 31-bp sequence from the 5′-untranslated region and 121-bp sequence from 3′-untranslated region, were designated pFLAG-DYRK1Bb or pGBDU-DYRK1Bb. The 1.5-kb fragment containing 3′ end of splice variant a (21.Leder S. Weber Y. Altafai X. Estivill X. Joost H.G. Becker W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 254: 474-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, GenBank™ accession number NP_004705) of DYRK1B was generated by digestion of EST clone BG832206 with SalI and BglII. This fragment was used to substitute the 1-kb SalI/BamHI sequence in pFLAG-DYRK1Bb or the 1-kb SalI/BglII sequence in pGBDU-DYRK1Bb to produce pFLAG-DYRK1Ba or pGBDU-DYRK1Ba, respectively. To construct pGEX-DYRK1Ba, pGBDU-DYRK1Ba was digested with BglII, blunt-ended, and cut with EcoRI. Then the 2.4-kb fragment was ligated into pGEX-4T1, which had been digested with SalI, blunt-ended, and cut with EcoRI. Mouse DYRK1A was amplified by PCR from EST clone BE372353 using two primers (5′-GAATTCGCGGCCGCGATGCATACAGGAGGAGAG-3′ and 5′-AGATCTGTCGACTCACGAGCTAGCTACAGGACTC-3′). To construct pFLAGDYRK1A, the 2.3-kb PCR product was digested with NotI and SalI and ligated into NotI/SalI-cut pFLAG-CMV-2. To construct pGEX-DYRK1A, the 2.3-kb PCR product was digested with EcoRI and SalI and ligated into EcoRI/SalI-cut pGEX-4T1. Expression and Purification of Recombinant Proteins—E. coli cells BL21/DE3, transformed with pET vectors that contained the cDNA for mutated glycogen synthases, were grown at 37 °C until the A600 was ∼0.7, then induced with 0.1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside and grown at 30 °C for an additional 16 h. Purification of the recombinant proteins was by the method of Zhang et al. (13.Zhang W. DePaoli-Roach A.A. Roach P.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 304: 219-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Vectors encoding DYRK1A and DYRK2 as glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins (pGEX-DYRK1A and pGEX-DYRK2) were used to transform E. coli cell BL21/DE3. Transformants were isolated, induced with isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 16 h at 37 °C, and the recombinant proteins were purified over glutathione-agarose. Bound proteins were eluted from the resin with 20 mm glutathione. The purified proteins were dialyzed against a buffer comprising 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 15 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 30% glycerol to remove residual glutathione, and were stored at –80 °C. The concentrations of protein kinases were determined by measuring optical density of the bands in Coomassie-stained gels using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Assay of Protein Kinase Activity—Protein kinase activity was determined by measuring the incorporation of [32P]phosphate into glycogen synthase mutants WTΔ; 2,AAΔ; 2,SAΔ; or 2,ASΔ (Fig. 1). Unless otherwise stated, assays contained, in a final volume of 20 μl: 0.2 μg of glycogen synthase, 10 μm ATP, 0.5–1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, a portion of enzyme sample, and kinase assay buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol). After incubation at 37 °C for 20 min, reactions were terminated by addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer and boiling for 5 min. Polypeptides were separated by SDS-PAGE, gels were stained with Coomassie Blue and dried. The phospholabeled proteins were detected by autoradiography, then excised from gels and the radioactivity incorporated was quantitated by scintillation counting. Purification of 3a-Kinase from Rabbit Skeletal Muscle—Approximately 6 kg of rabbit skeletal muscle was homogenized in 12 liters of buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 0.5 mg/ml benzamidine) and centrifuged for 40 min at 5000 × g. The supernatant was filtered through glass wool and solid ammonium sulfate was added to bring the final concentration to 55% saturation. After stirring for 60 min, the suspension was centrifuged for 30 min at 5000 × g, the supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was resuspended in 1.2 liters of buffer A. The solution was centrifuged for 60 min at 100,000 × g, and the supernatant was loaded onto a 600-ml column of phenyl-Sepharose CL-4B (Sigma) equilibrated in buffer A. After subsequent washings with buffer A and buffer A with 25% ethylene glycol, 3a-kinase was eluted with buffer A containing 50% ethylene glycol and dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mm PMSF (buffer B). The dialyzed protein was chromatographed on a 200-ml column of SP-Sepharose HP (Pharmacia) equilibrated in buffer B. After washing with buffer B, 3a-kinase was eluted with a 400-ml linear gradient of 50–400 mm NaCl. The majority of 3a-kinase activity was eluted at ∼200 mm NaCl. The active fractions were pooled, dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mm PMSF (buffer C), and loaded onto a 40-ml column of Q-Sepharose (Pharmacia) equilibrated in buffer C. The column was washed with buffer C, followed by a 200-ml linear gradient of 50–400 mm NaCl in buffer C. The 3a-kinase activity was eluted at ∼130 mm NaCl. The most active fractions were pooled, dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mm PMSF, 0.01% Brij 35 (buffer D) and applied to a 5-ml column of heparin-Sepharose HT (Pharmacia) equilibrated in buffer D. The column was developed with a 100-ml linear gradient of 50–400 mm NaCl in buffer D and 3a-kinase was eluted as one major peak at 350 mm NaCl. The active fractions were pooled, dialyzed against 10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.01% Brij 35 (buffer E), and loaded on a 1-ml column of ceramic hydroxyapatite (Bio-Rad) equilibrated in buffer E. The column was developed with a 40-ml linear gradient of 10–300 mm potassium phosphate. The fractions containing 3a-kinase were pooled, dialyzed against buffer E, and stored at –80 °C. Tryptic Digestion of Purified Proteins and Amino Acid Sequencing— Purified material from the heparin-Sepharose step was concentrated and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and stained with Coomassie Blue. The membrane pieces containing protein bands were excised, destained in 70% acetonitrile, and dried. The membrane pieces were placed in 50 μl of digestion mixture containing 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10% acetonitrile, 0.1% reduced Triton X-100, and 0.2 μg of modified porcine trypsin (Promega, sequencing grade). After incubation for 24 h at 37 °C, samples were sonicated and supernatants were removed. Membranes were washed two times with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and the supernatants were pooled with the previous one. The combined supernatants were chromatographed on a Vydac C18 column (250 × 2.1 mm) connected to an Applied Biosystems Microbore high performance liquid chromatography system equilibrated in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The column was developed with a linear acetonitrile gradient in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Peptides detected by absorbance at 214 nm were collected and analyzed by Edman sequencing. MALDI-TOF Mass Spectrometry Analysis—Protein bands were excised from gels, cut into small pieces, destained with 50% acetonitrile, 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate, reduced with 10 mm dithiothreitol (Sigma), and alkylated with 55 mm iodoacetamide (Sigma). After alkylation, the gel slices were digested with trypsin (Promega) in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate (enzyme substrate ratio 1:50 to 1:100) overnight at 37 °C. The peptides were extracted from the gel with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in 60% acetonitrile for 30 min. One microliter of the extracted protein solution was spotted on a MALDI plate with 1 μl of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (Sigma) in a 50% acetonitrile, 50% methanol matrix solution. Mass spectra were recorded using the positive reflection mode of a MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer (Micromass, Manchester, UK). The time of flight was measured using the following parameters: 3,400 V pulse voltage, 15,000 V source voltage, 500 V reflectron voltage, 1,950 V MCP voltage, and low mass gate of 400 Da. For high accuracy mass measurement, the instrument was tuned to a resolution just over 15,000 full width at peak half-height. The MALDI-MS data obtained were used for data base searches. Antibodies—HAN11 antibodies were generated against a peptide having sequence corresponding to residues 45–51 in HAN11. Rabbits were immunized with this peptide (NKVQLVGLDEESSEFIC) coupled to Imject® maleimide-activated mariculture keyhole limpet hemocyanin (Pierce). After the third booster injection, serum was collected and incubated with an affinity resin prepared by coupling a peptide to Sulfo-Link beads (Pierce). After exhaustively washing the resin, the anti-peptide antibodies were eluted with 0.3 m glycine-HCl, pH 2.7, neutralized, and dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline. Antibodies to FLAG (M2) were from Sigma. Antibodies to Dyrk1A were from BD Biosciences. Antibodies p-GS(S641), which specifically recognize phosphorylated site 3a in glycogen synthase, were from Cell Signaling Technology. Northern Blot Analysis—A human multiple tissue Northern blot (Clontech) was probed with a 32P-labeled 1.6-kb HAN11 fragment excised from EST clone AA442821 by EcoRI and NotI digestion. The procedure was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol. Electrophoresis and Immunoblotting—To analyze protein expression, mouse tissues were homogenized in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1 mm Nα-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone (TLCK), 2 mm benzamidine, 0.5 mm PMSF, and 0.01 mg/ml leupeptin. The homogenates were centrifuged for 20 min at 17,000 × g and the supernatants were retained for analysis. Approximately 50 μg of protein from each tissue was separated by SDS-PAGE followed by transfer to nitrocellulose, which was probed with affinity purified anti-HAN11 antibodies. Transient Transfection and Analysis of Expressed Proteins—COS-M9 cells were transiently transfected by using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen). Briefly, 0.5–1 μg of plasmid DNA per 6 μl of LipofectAMINE was used to transfect cells in a 35-mm dish. Cells were grown for 2 days and frozen in liquid nitrogen in 0.2 ml of buffer A, containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 10 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 100 mm NaF, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm PMSF, 0.1 mm TLCK, or in buffer B that contained 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors. Cells frozen in buffer A or buffer B were used for glycogen synthase assay or to analyze for interactions between expressed proteins, respectively. After thawing, cells were homogenized and centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min. To analyze the interaction between S-tag HAN11 and FLAG-tagged DYRK isoforms, the supernatants were incubated with S protein-agarose (Novagen) in the presence of 0.1% Triton X-100. The precipitates were washed three times with buffer B containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and proteins were eluted with SDS-PAGE loading buffer. The supernatants, the pellet fractions, and the S protein-agarose precipitates were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blot. Glycogen Synthase Assay—Glycogen synthase activity was determined in the pellet fractions of COS cell homogenates by measuring the incorporation of [14C]glucose from UDP-[U-14C]glucose into glycogen (22.Thomas J.A. Schlender K.K. Larner J. Anal. Biochem. 1968; 25: 486-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (947) Google Scholar) as described previously (9.Skurat A.V. Wang Y. Roach P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25534-25542Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The –/+ glucose-6-P activity ratio was calculated after subtraction of endogenous glycogen synthase activity in COS cells (9.Skurat A.V. Wang Y. Roach P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25534-25542Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Activities of recombinant GST-DYRK1A and GST-DYRK2 were measured by the inactivation of added recombinant glycogen synthase protein as monitored by the decrease in the –/+ glucose-6-P activity ratio as a function of time. Reaction mixtures (total volume 0.1 ml) were composed of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2,1mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm ATP, and 3 μg of glycogen synthase. Reactions were started by adding 20 μl of GST-DYRK1a, GST-DYRK2, or protein kinase dilution buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.1 m NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 30% glycerol). After incubation at 30 °C for the indicated times the 10-μl aliquots were removed and mixed with 80 μl of glycogen synthase assay buffer containing 20 mm EDTA (9.Skurat A.V. Wang Y. Roach P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25534-25542Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to measure glycogen synthase activity. Analysis of Phosphorylation of Site 3a in Glycogen Synthase—Glycogen synthase was incubated in the presence of GST-DYRK1A and GST-DYRK2 under the same conditions as described for time course inactivation of glycogen synthase. At the indicated times, 18-μl aliquots were removed, mixed with SDS-PAGE gel loading buffer, and analyzed by Western blot using phospho-specific antibodies that recognize phosphorylated site 3a (p-GS(S641) antibodies). Activity Assay of Recombinant DYRK1A and DYRK2—Protein kinase activity was determined by measuring the incorporation of [32P]phosphate into protein substrates. The substrates, which included purified rabbit skeletal muscle glycogen synthase, glycogen phosphorylase b, phosphorylase kinase, protein phosphatase inhibitor-2, and recombinant targeting subunit (RGL/GM) of the muscle-specific glycogen-associated type 1 protein phosphatase (exon 1), were kindly provided by Dr. Anna DePaoli-Roach (Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN). Assays contained, in a final volume of 20 μl: 0.8 μg of protein substrate, 10 μm ATP, 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, 16 ng of GST-DYRK1A or 2 ng of GST-DYRK2, and kinase assay buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol). To estimate endogenous phosphorylation in protein substrates, GST-DYRK1A and GST-DYRK2 were excluded from the reaction mixture. After incubation at 37 °C for 10 min, reactions were terminated by addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer and boiling for 5 min. Histones H1 and H2B were obtained from Roche. Individual caseins, αs1-casein, β-casein, and κ-casein, obtained from Dr. P. J. Roach, Indiana University, were originally a gift from Dr. Elizabeth W. Bingham, USDA Eastern Regional Research Center, Philadelphia, PA. Polypeptides were separated by SDS-PAGE, gels were stained with Coomassie Blue and dried. The phospho-labeled proteins were detected by autoradiography, then excised from gels and the radioactivity incorporated was quantitated by scintillation counting. Expression of HAN11 in Rat1 Fibroblasts—Stable clones of Rat1 fibroblasts expressing StagHAN11 were generated by transfection of cells with pcDNA-S-HAN11 using LipofectAMINE and selection of the clones with 0.5 mg/ml Geneticin (Invitrogen). Design of Substrates for Purification of Glycogen Synthase Kinases—To monitor 3a-kinase activity during purification, mutant forms of glycogen synthase were designed, expressed in E. coli, and purified. All the glycogen synthases are truncated at Lys682 to avoid phospho"

Here, we present biochemical and electron microscopic evidence of Ca2+-sensitive structural changes in the three-dimensional structure of type 1 IP3R (IP3R1). Low concentrations of Ca2+ and high concentrations of Sr2+ and Ba2+ were shown to be effective for the limited proteolysis of IP3R1, but Mg2+ had no effect on the proteolysis. The electron microscopy and the limited proteolysis consistently demonstrated that the effective concentration of Ca2+ for conformational changes in IP3R1 was <10-7m and that the IP3 scarcely affected the conformational states. The structure of IP3R1 without Ca2+, as reconstructed by three-dimensional electron microscopy, had a “mushroom-like” appearance consisting of a large square-shaped head and a small channel domain linked by four thin bridges. The projection image of the “head-to-head” assembly comprising two particles confirmed the mushroom-like side view. The “windmill-like” form of IP3R1 with Ca2+ also contains the four bridges connecting from the IP3-binding domain toward the channel domain. These data suggest that the Ca2+-specific conformational change structurally regulates the IP3-triggered channel opening within IP3R1.

Neuron. 1998; 21: 13-26Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1735) Google Scholar). IP3Rs are structurally divided into three regions: 1) a large cytoplasmic region with an IP3 binding pocket close to the N terminus; 2) a transmembrane region near the C terminus; and 3) a short C-terminal tail (2Furuichi T. Yoshikawa S. Miyawaki A. Wada K. Maeda N. Mikoshiba K. Nature. 1989; 342: 32-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar). The most characterized IP3R, type 1 IP3R (IP3R1), a predominant type in the cerebellar endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and spine apparatus, is a 2749-amino acid polypeptide (2Furuichi T. Yoshikawa S.

Protein Eng. 2001; 14: 867-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar).The IP3 never fully opened the channel of IP3R without Ca2+. Previous functional analysis indicates that the low Ca2+ level acts as an essential co-agonist for IP3-gated Ca2+ release (11Iino M. J. Gen. Physiol. 1990; 95: 1103-1122Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar, 12Iino M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 142: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 13Bezprozvanny I.

The requirement of the dual ligands is considered to be an important basis of the signaling cross-talk involved in the cell function (15Berridge M.J. Lipp P. Bootman M.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 11-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (4372) Google Scholar). Thus, it would be useful to understand how the binding of co-agonists structurally opens the channel of IP3R. Recently, the x-ray structure of the crystallized IP3 binding core has revealed the spatial relationship among a specific IP3-binding site and two plausible Ca2+-binding sites (4Bosanac I. Alattia J.R. Mal T.K. Chan J. Talarico S. Tong F.K. Tong K.I. Yoshikawa F. Furuichi T. Iwai M. Michikawa T. Mikoshiba K. Ikura M. Nature. 2002; 420: 696-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). The local allosteric coupling of IP3- and Ca2+-binding sites in this domain is thought to be one of the possible elements for the requirement of dual agonists to open the channel. However, additional six Ca2+-binding sites have been detected by extensive screening of expressed IP3R1-fragments outside the IP3 binding core (16Sienaert I. De Smedt H. Parys J.B. Missiaen L.

Furthermore, allosteric sites for regulations were widely distributed outside the IP3 binding core (20Furuichi T. Mikoshiba K. J. Neurochem. 1995; 64: 953-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Thus, it is quite important to visualize the overall behavior of tetrameric IP3R to elucidate the mechanism underlying channel gating by IP3 and Ca2+.Knowledge of the spatial interrelations and rearrangements of the transmembranous channel and ligand-binding domains is central to understanding how IP3R carries out channel gating by structural coupling. Biochemical analyses have revealed that the IP3-gated Ca2+ release requires interdomain associations between the channel and the IP3-binding domains (21Joseph S.K. Pierson S. Samanta S. Biochem. J. 1995; 307: 859-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 22Boehning D. Joseph S.K. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5450-5459Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 23Yoshikawa F. Iwasaki H.

From a structural perspective, an investigation of this coupling problem requires information regarding the three-dimensional arrangement of these functional modules. However, knowledge of the overall quaternary structure has been limited because of the apparent heterogeneity within IP3R particles (24Chadwick C.C. Saito A. Fleischer S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

One is square-shaped (26Kanaseki T. Ikeuchi Y. Tashiro Y. Cell Struct. Funct. 1998; 23: 373-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 27Hamada K. Miyata T. Mayanagi K. Hirota J. Mikoshiba K. J.

A. 1990; 87: 2132-2136Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 27Hamada K. Miyata T. Mayanagi K. Hirota J. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol.

Chem. 2003; 278: 21319-21322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). We have postulated that these dual structures are attributable to global conformational changes between the square state (S-state) and windmill state (W-state) within tetrameric IP3R particles as described previously (27Hamada K. Miyata T. Mayanagi K. Hirota J. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21115-21118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). To obtain structural evidence in support of this hypothesis, it is essential to unveil the three-dimensional structure of IP3R to exclude the possibility that the duality of structure is an illusion arising from the orientation of the projections. However, the recent three-dimensional maps are very incoherent (28Jiang Q.X. Thrower E.C. Chester D.W. Ehrlich B.E. Sigworth F.J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3575-3581Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 29Da Fonseca P.C. Morris S.A. Nerou E.P. Taylor C.W. Morris E.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 2003; 278: 21319-21322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), especially with regard to their side views, which is probably because of the structural flexibility and the lack of direct visualization. These two points are potentially large problems for the three-dimensional reconstruction by single-particle analysis, and thus information regarding well controlled conditions for the stable states and reliable raw images with higher signal-to-noise ratio are required for a precise understanding of the three-dimensional structure of IP3R. In this study, we directly visualized a clear side view of IP3R1 using negative staining and reconstructed the first three-dimensional structure in two-state conformations based on single-particle analysis using electron microscopy to gain insight into the mechanism by which the cytoplasmic architecture couples with the transmembrane channel. We also studied the effective concentration and the specificity of Ca2+, and we discuss functional implications of the global structural changes in IP3R1.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPurification of Native and Recombinant IP3R1s—Immunoaffinity purification of cerebellar IP3R1 was performed as described previously (27Hamada K. Miyata T. Mayanagi K. Hirota J. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21115-21118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). For the purification of recombinant IP3R1 with the C-terminal 2218-2749 residues deleted (Δ-CT), we used a recombinant baculovirus (31Ando H. Mizutani A. Matsu-ura T. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10602-10612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf-9) cells were incubated at 27 °C for 3 days after being infected with the baculovirus. Harvested Sf-9 cells were washed with over 3 volumes of ice-cold saline at least twice. They were mixed with 10 volumes of the Tris buffer (pH 7.5) containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm KCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm octylglucoside, and four kinds of protease inhibitors (200 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μm pepstatin A, 10 μm leupeptin, and 10 μm E-64), and homogenized with 10 strokes at 1,000 rpm in a glass Teflon Potter homogenizer. The homogenates were centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 5 min at 2 °C, and the resulting pellet was re-homogenized. The combined supernatant was centrifuged at 105,000 × g for 1 h at 2 °C. The clear supernatant was added to glutathione-Sepharose beads pre-equilibrated with the Tris buffer, mixed, and incubated for 30 min at 4 °C. The affinity beads were washed with 25 volumes of the same buffer at least five times and packed into a column. Δ-CT specifically bound to matrix was eluted with an equal volume of the buffer containing 10 mm glutathione. The elution procedure was repeated three times. The eluates were pooled, concentrated, quick-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80 °C.Partial Proteolysis—Partial proteolysis experiments were carried out in a solution containing IP3R1 and lysyl endopeptidase (Lys-C) as described previously (27Hamada K. Miyata T. Mayanagi K. Hirota J. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21115-21118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Proteolytic fragments were analyzed by discontinuous PAGE (5 or 10% gel) and immunoblotted using the monoclonal antibodies 4C11 and 18A10. Free Ca2+ concentrations were calculated using the program MAXC (www.stanford.edu/~cpatton/maxc.html).Electron Microscopy and Image Processing—The purified IP3R1 (0.5 μl) was injected into 9.5 μl of Tris buffer (pH 7.5) containing various concentrations of Ca2+ and incubated for 1 h on ice. A 4-μl aliquot of the mixture was applied onto carbon-coated copper grids, which were fleshly glow-discharged. Excess solution was removed by filter paper, and the IP3R1 particles were stained with 2 μl of 1% (w/v) uranyl acetate solution. Dried grids were examined on a JEM 1200 EX transmission electron microscope operated at 80-kV acceleration voltage with an LaB6 cathode. Micrographs were recorded on Kodak films at nominal magnifications ranging from ×25,000 to ×50,000 under low dose conditions (∼10 e-/Å) with 0.5-1.5-μm defocus. Images were digitized on a flatbed scanner, and the identifiable particles were windowed into smaller images (windmill: 80 × 80 pixels; square: 64 × 64 pixels; and head-to-head: 100 × 100 pixels) at a final pixel size of 5.3 Å.Image processing was accomplished by using the EMAN (32Ludtke S.J. Baldwin P.R. Chiu W. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 128: 82-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (2099) Google Scholar, 33Ludtke S.J. Jakana J. Song J.L. Chuang D.T. Chiu W. J. Mol.

For three-dimensional reconstruction, the identifiable square and windmill images were corrected for the effect of the contrast transfer function by using a spherical aberration constant (3.4 mm) and bandpass-filtered with a 0.05 Å-1 low and 0.003 Å-1 high frequency cut-off to remove unwanted spatial frequencies. The three-dimensional model presented here was produced by a standard procedure using an EMAN package. First, we generated an initial model from the selected top and side views (300-400 particles) by imposing 4-fold symmetry. Based on a set of projections generated by a reprojection of the initial three-dimensional map, the windowed raw images (square: 6099 particles; windmill: 3997 particles) were classified by the multi-reference alignment and each class average was calculated with 10 refinements. The resultant class averages were back-projected to make a new three-dimensional map, which was then used as a starting model for the next iteration. A final map was obtained by 10 iteration cycles. Visualizations of the three-dimensional map were performed using Micro AVS (Kubota Graphics Technologies).RESULTSCa2+-sensitive Proteolysis of IP3R1—We monitored the Ca2+ sensitivity of native and recombinant IP3R1s by means of limited proteolysis. To investigate the overall pattern of limited proteolysis, we separated the large fragments with 5% gel and detected them by double-labeling with 4C11 and 18A10 antibodies. The pattern of fragments resulting from immunopurified native IP3R1 was clearly Ca2+-dependent (Fig. 1A, upper panel). Many more ladder bands were observed in the 1 mm EGTA solution than in the 1 mm CaCl2 solution. The 100- and 105-kDa products were particularly abundant in the presence of Ca2+. Especially, the 38-kDa fragment, which was separated with 10% gel and labeled with 4C11, exhibited a marked Ca2+ dependence (Fig. 1A, lower panel). These data confirmed the findings of our previous study using Ca2+-EDTA solutions (27Hamada K. Miyata T. Mayanagi K. Hirota J. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21115-21118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The Ca2+ dependence of recombinant IP3R1 (Δ-CT) was different from that of native IP3R1 (Fig. 1B). The 38-kDa band was abundantly observed in the 1 mm EGTA solution when the recombinant IP3R1 was digested by 0.5 and 2 μg/ml Lys-C.To investigate the selectivity of divalent cations for the structural changes, we performed the limited proteolysis in the presence of Ca2+, Mg2+, Sr2+, and Ba2+ using a microsomal membrane as shown in Fig. 2A. Sr2+ and Ba2+ as Ca2+ analogues were effective at enhancing proteolysis, but Mg2+ clearly had no effect (Fig. 2A). Based on the calculation of free cations by MAXC, the effective concentrations of Ca2+ and Sr2+ were <0.01 and 0.1 mm, respectively, whereas the required concentration of Ba2+ was >0.5 mm. These data clearly indicated that the limited proteolysis of IP3R1 was Ca2+-dependent.Fig. 2Effects of divalent cations on partial proteolysis of microsomal IP3R1.A, microsomal IP3R1 was digested by Lys-C (10 μg/ml) in the presence of CaCl2, MgCl2, SrCl2, or BaCl2. Proteolytic fragments (38-kDa) in 15,000 × g supernatants were detected with 4C11 as described previously (27Hamada K. Miyata T. Mayanagi K. Hirota J. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21115-21118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). B, effective concentration of free Ca2+ upon IP3-unliganded or IP3-liganded IP3R1 (in 10 μm IP3).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To evaluate the concentration dependence toward free Ca2+ in more detail, we performed a series of proteolytic estimations under a micromolar range of Ca2+. The apparent EC50 of Ca2+ ranged from 10-8m to 10-7 M (Fig. 2B). In the presence of a supramaximal amount of IP3 (10 μm), the effective concentration of Ca2+ was unchanged (Fig. 2B). This result was consistent with the undetectable change in the overall appearance of IP3R1 in the presence of IP3 (1 or 10 μm) as monitored by electron microscopy.Electron Microscopic Analysis of Negatively Stained IP3R1—To correlate the specific Ca2+ dependence on enzymatic proteolysis with the global conformational changes as a function of Ca2+, we performed a series of microscopic observations under the micromolar range of Ca2+. The rapidly immunopurified IP3R1 in the 0.5 mm EGTA solution was incubated in the presence of various concentration of free Ca2+ and was negatively stained and imaged in a transmission electron microscope. The windmill-like particles were clearly observed in the presence of Ca2+ as shown in Fig. 3. The maximal abundance of windmill-structures was shown at the concentration of 0.1 μm, which was approximately six times greater than that under the Ca2+-depleted condition (Fig. 3B). The apparent EC50 ranged from 10-8m to 10-7m, quite similar to that for the Ca2+-dependent proteolysis (Fig. 2B).Fig. 3Electron microscopic estimation of the effective concentration of free Ca2+ upon conformational changes in purified IP3R1.A, a representative view of negatively stained IP3R1. White arrows show identifiable windmill particles. Bar, 50 nm. B, Ca2+-dependent abundance of windmill structures. IP3R1 was purified in the presence of 0.5 mm EGTA and injected into the buffer containing various concentrations of free Ca2+, which were calculated by WinMAXC. Experimental values were expressed as counts of windmill particles possessing more than three wings in a micrograph taken at a nominal magnification of 25,000.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To analyze the top views and side views of IP3R1 in more detail, raw images of the IP3R1 particles were collected and subjected to reference-based alignment analyses. In the presence of Ca2+, the raw images with 4-fold symmetry indicated four segregated radial wings composed of two domains: a globular domain and a constricted segment bridging the globular domain and the central core domain (Fig. 4A, upper montage). These structural properties were explicitly confirmed by the image analysis (Fig. 4A, lower row). The other stained images were classified into at least three types. We categorized the windmill-like particles without 4-fold symmetry into the “tilted view” (Fig. 4B), the flatten triangle images with three heads into the “three-headed side view” (Fig. 4C), and the V-shaped images into the “two-headed side view” (Fig. 4D), respectively. The dimensions of the average were ∼30 nm from the tip of one wing to the tip of the opposite wing within the top view and the tilted view (Fig. 4, A and B). The widths of average of the three-headed and two-headed side views were around 29 and 26 nm, respectively (Fig. 4, C and D). The height of the two-headed side view was approximately 16 nm. The diameter of the globular density in the segregated wing was consistently 7-9 nm within the all four types of views (Fig. 4, A-D).Fig. 4Electron microscopic images and image analyses of negatively stained IP3R1.Upper montages show individual images, and lower boxes present class averages (left) and contours (right) calculated by the reference-based alignment method. A, typical top views of windmill-like particles in the presence of Ca2+. Tilted views of windmill-like particles (B), three-headed side views (C), and two-headed side views (D) were also observed in the presence of Ca2+. Top views of square-shaped particles (E), typical mushroom-like side views of single particles (F), and unique side views of two IP3R1 particles arranged in a head-to-head fashion (G) were visualized in the Ca2+-free solution. Class averages of selected top views (A, resolution: 3.8 nm), tilted views (B, resolution: 5.3 nm), three-headed side views (C, resolution: 4.2 nm), and two-headed side views (D, resolution: 3.9 nm) of Ca2+-bound form were calculated from 271, 132, 219, and 56 particles, respectively. Class averages of selected top views (E, resolution: 4.0 nm), side views (F, resolution: 3.7 nm), and head-to-head views (G, resolution: 3.3 nm) of Ca2+-unbound form were calculated from 229, 134, and 132 particles, respectively. 4-fold symmetry-produced images were used as a reference on analyses of the top view. The arrows in C and D represent the three and two separated densities, respectively. The arrows in G indicate the site of the two-particle binding interface within the head-to-head assembly. Areas enclosed by black lines in F and G delineate window architectures. Resolutions were determined with the Fourier ring correlation criterion on the Xmipp program package (34Marabini R. Masegosa I.M. San M. Iacute N, M.C. Marco S. Fernandez J.J. de la Fraga L.G. Vaquerizo C. Carazo J.M. J. Struct.

Bars, 10 nm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Under Ca2+-free conditions, we found three characteristic projections: the square-shaped top view (Fig. 4E), the mushroom-like side view (Fig. 4F), and the symmetric “head-to-head” IP3R1 assembly composed of two mushroom-like particles (Fig. 4G). The dimensions of the square-shaped top view, which was composed of four separate densities, were ∼19 nm/side (Fig. 4E), similar to the dense projections in the ER of rat Purkinje cells (26Kanaseki T. Ikeuchi Y. Tashiro Y. Cell Struct. Funct. 1998; 23: 373-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) and to the negatively stained images of purified IP3R1 (27Hamada K. Miyata T. Mayanagi K. Hirota J. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21115-21118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The relative abundance of head-to-head views was much less than that of the isolated mushroom views; however, the raw image of the head-to-head assembly was quite identifiable by a binding interface that appeared as extremely stained clefts between two particles (Fig. 4G), which strongly confirmed that the mushroom projection is a side view perpendicular to its long axis. Regardless of the starting references, the resultant averages of the side-view images indicated that the overall dimensions of the mushroom particle and the head-to-head assembly were 24 × 17 and 24 × 33 nm, respectively (Fig. 4, F and G). Based on these projections, we can determine that the IP3R1 particle can be divided into two major domains: a smaller ellipsoidal component (12 × 7 nm) and a larger isosceles triangle component (24 × 10 nm) that attaches to an adjacent face in the head-to-head assembly. This protruding mass is thought to contain the membrane-traversing segments of the IP3R1, whereas the large component has dimensions similar to rectangular dense projections that have been observed on the cytoplasmic side of the ER membrane (26Kanaseki T. Ikeuchi Y. Tashiro Y. Cell Struct. Funct. 1998; 23: 373-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar); thus, we will refer to these two structures as the channel and cytoplasmic domains. Furthermore, the most striking feature of the cytoplasmic domain was the presence of large-stained cavities (∼3 nm) that we will call “windows” surrounded by narrow protein densities that we will refer to as “bridges,” which formed a link between the channel domain and the cytoplasmic domain containing the interface between the two particles (Fig. 4, F and G).Three-dimensional Reconstruction of IP3R1—We generated a low resolution three-dimensional model from the selected top and side views and refined the model by im"

We report on a monoclonal antibody, V5B2, raised against a peptide from the C-terminal part of PrP, which recognizes an epitope specific to PrPSc. In cryostat sections from Creutzfeldt-Jacob's disease (CJD) patients' brains, V5B2 selectively labels various deposits of PrPSc without any pretreatment for removal of PrPC. V5B2 does not bind to non-CJD brain samples or to recombinant PrP, either in its native or denatured form. Specificity for PrP is confirmed by a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay utilizing V5B2, which discriminates between CJD and normal samples without proteinase K treatment, and by immunoprecipitation from CJD brain homogenate.

Nature. 1967; 215: 1043-1044Google Scholar, 2Prusiner S.B. Science. 1982; 216: 136-144Google Scholar). PrPSc forms characteristic insoluble aggregates, is partially resistant to protease digestion, and differs in secondary structure from PrPC (1Griffith J.S. Nature. 1967; 215: 1043-1044Google Scholar, 2Prusiner S.B. Science. 1982; 216: 136-144Google Scholar, 3Prusiner S.B. Scott M.R. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1997; 31: 139-175Google Scholar). The importance of TSE arose in the last decade with the epidemic of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) and the appearance of a new variant of Creutzfeldt-Jacob's disease (vCJD), predominantly but not exclusively in the United Kingdom. A specific, rapid, and sensitive test for detecting PrPSc is required to minimize the possible risk of prion contamination. Currently available methods for immunological diagnosis of TSE rely on the use of antibodies that react with both forms of PrP (4Will R.G. Ironside J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4738-4739Google Scholar) and, thus, depend on prior elimination of PrPC by proteinase K digestion for positive identification of the remaining PrPSc (5Giaccone G. Canciani B. Puoti G. Rossi G. Goffredo D. Iussich S. Fociani P. Tagliavini F. Bugiani O. Brain Pathol. 2000; 10: 31-37Google Scholar) as its partially digested product, PrPres. Because it has been established that the conformation of PrPSc differs from that of PrPC, the aim of our work was to identify the epitope specific for PrPSc that would enable better insight into the differences between the two isoforms and provide a tool for analyzing biological samples. An earlier study reported production of a monoclonal antibody (mAb) specific for the disease-associated form of PrP (6Korth C. Stierli B. Streit P. Moser M. Schaller O. Fischer R. Schulz-Schaeffer W. Kretzschmar H. Raeber A. Braun U. Ehrensperger F. Hornemann S. Glockshuber R. Riek R. Billeter M. Wuthrich K. Oesch B. Nature. 1997; 390: 74-77Google Scholar). It was later stated by the same authors that the availability of PrP knock-out mice and recombinant PrP (recPrP) were some of the prerequisites for successful immunization and generation of the specific antibodies (7Korth C. Streit P. Oesch B. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 309: 106-122Google Scholar). Our approach for generating PrPSc-selective mAbs was to immunize BALB/c mice with carefully chosen peptides based on previous investigations on the structure and mechanism of PrPSc formation. We have prepared a mAb that reacts with an epitope specific for the native PrPSc and show that this epitope could not be generated in vitro from recombinant PrP. We suggest that the C-terminal part of PrPSc folds into a distinct conformation, which may be stabilized by interaction with other molecules under disease conditions. prion protein cellular PrP pathological PrP isoform recombinant PrP bovine spongiform encephalopathy transmissible spongiform encephalopathy bovine serum albumin Creutzfeldt-Jacob's disease sporadic CJD variant of CJD enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay guanidine HCl horseradish peroxidase immunohistochemistry keyhole limpet hemocyanin monoclonal antibody phosphate-buffered saline. prion protein cellular PrP pathological PrP isoform recombinant PrP bovine spongiform encephalopathy transmissible spongiform encephalopathy bovine serum albumin Creutzfeldt-Jacob's disease sporadic CJD variant of CJD enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay guanidine HCl horseradish peroxidase immunohistochemistry keyhole limpet hemocyanin monoclonal antibody phosphate-buffered saline.

Brain Tissue Sample Preparation—Human brain tissue samples (nine sCJD positive and two non-CJD) were homogenized (HT1000 Potter homogenizer) in ice-cold PBS containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40 and 0.5% deoxycholate to give a 10% (w/v) final suspension.

Dot Blot Analysis—50 μlof10×,20×,or40× diluted supernatants of brain homogenates were loaded on 0.2-μm nitrocellulose membranes using the dot blot (Bio-Rad). The membranes were blocked with 5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk (Amersham Biosciences) in Tris-buffered saline/Tween 20 (TBS-T) at 4 °C overnight and then incubated with primary mAbs (5 μg/ml V5B2 or 0.2 μg/ml 3F4 in 1% milk/TBS-T) for 1 h with shaking at room temperature. Membranes were washed with TBS-T and incubated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-labeled anti-mouse secondary antibody (Amersham Biosciences; 1:1500 in 1% milk/TBS-T) at room temperature for 1 h. Reaction was detected using chemiluminescence detection reagents (ECL, Amersham Biosciences). Western Blot Analysis—Native or proteinase K-digested (final proteinase K concentration 5 μg/ml for 30 min at 37 °C, heat inactivated) supernatants of brain homogenates, denatured with SDS-PAGE sample buffer (Novex), were loaded on SDS-Tris-glycine polyacrylamide gels (7.5% gel) and run for 60 min at 120 V with 25 mm Tris, 0.32 m glycine, and 0.16% SDS (w/v), pH 8.3. The samples were blotted on 0.2 μm nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad) for 60 min at 200 mA using 25 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine, and 20% methanol buffer. The membranes were blocked, and proteins were detected as described above. Sandwich ELISA with Brain Tissue Homogenates—Microtiter plates (Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark) were coated with 5 μg/ml mAb 6H4 (Prionics, Zürich, Switzerland) in 50 mm carbonate/bicarbonate buffer, pH 9.6. The plates were blocked with 1% BSA and 50 μl of sCJD or non-CJD brain homogenates in 1% BSA/PBS/Tween20 were applied to the wells. After 90 min of incubation at 37 °C, V5B2, conjugated with HRP and diluted 1:1000 in 1% BSA/PBS/Tween 20, was added to the wells. After 90 min incubation at 37 °C reaction was detected as an indirect ELISA. Immunoprecipitation—mAb V5B2 was covalently coupled to carboxyl-terminated magnetic beads (Sigma) using 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide as a bifunctional coupling reagent as suggested by the manufacturer. Beads were preincubated in 1% BSA/PBS at room temperature for 1 h and washed in binding buffer (3% Nonidet P-40, 3% Tween, and 250 mm NaCl in 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4). 30 μl of brain homogenate containing ∼270 μg of protein was added to a suspension containing 50 μl of magnetic beads and 150 μl of binding buffer. Suspension was shaken for 1 h at room temperature and washed three times with washing buffer (2% Nonidet P-40, 2% Tween 20, and 350 mm NaCl in 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4). Bound proteins were eluted with SDS loading buffer and heated at 95 °C before application to gel electrophoresis and detection by either the 3F4 or the 6H4 antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. Cryosections of Fresh Frozen Tissue Samples—Brains of clinically suspected CJD cases were collected at autopsy and, prior to whole brain formalin fixation, pieces of cerebral and cerebellar tissue were frozen rapidly in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C until final pathological diagnosis of CJD. Brain cryosections of two sCJD cases and one non-CJD patient (cause of death was myocardial infarction) were used in this study. Sections were cut in the cryostat at 10 μm, thaw-mounted to SuperFrost Plus slides (Menzel Gläser, Germany), and labeled without prior fixation. Paraformaldehyde-fixed, Paraffin-embedded Tissue Samples—Brain tissues from 16 cases of sporadic CJD were used. Following 14 days of buffered 4% paraformaldehyde fixation, tissue blocks were immersed in 96% formic acid for 1 h and embedded in paraffin. 4-μm-thick sections were either microwaved (96 °C) in EDTA buffer (pH 8) for 10 min (“mild” pretreatment) or autoclaved for 30 min (121 °C), cooled, immersed for 5 min in 96% formic acid, and washed prior to immunohistochemistry (IHC). A sample of hematoxylin-eosin stained section of a vCJD case brain was destained and labeled immunohistochemically without any pretreatment. Indirect IHC—V5B2 was tested in manual IHC on CJD and non-CJD cryostat brain sections at concentrations ranging from 0.3 to 30 μg/ml. Commercially available anti-PrP antibody 3F4 (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark) was used for comparison. Manual IHC was performed on slide-mounted sections using the avidin-biotin method with a peroxidase substrate as described (8Bresjanac M. Antauer G. Exp. Neurol. 2000; 164: 53-59Google Scholar). IHC on paraffin-embedded sections was performed on an automated machine (Ventana Medical Systems, Tucson, AZ) using Ventana kits and prescribed protocols at every step of the procedure. In addition to non-CJD brain tissue that served as a control for V5B2 selectivity for PrPSc, controls of IHC labeling were performed by omitting primary antibody from the IHC protocol carried out on adjacent sections as described above. Hematoxylin (Dako) was used to lightly counterstain the cell nuclei on all IHC-labeled slides. The slides were analyzed under a microscope (Eclipse E600, Nikon). Images were acquired with an attached digital camera (DXM 1200 digital camera, Nikon) linked to a PC. V5B2 conjugated with HRP (V5B2-HRP) was used following the same antigen retrieval procedure as described above for direct IHC. The concentration of V5B2-HRP conjugate was 5 μg/ml. Preparation of Recombinant Proteins—The oligonucleotide (5′-phosphate-TGCATTACCCAGTATGAACGTGAAAGCCAGGCGTATTATTATTAAATG-3′) encoding peptide sequence, annealed with a corresponding complementary oligonucleotide, was ligated into pET31b(+) expression vector (Novagen; Ref. 9Kuliopulos A. Walsh C.T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1994; 116: 4599-4607Google Scholar) 3′ to the ketosteroid isomerase gene. Fusion protein was overproduced in Escherichia coli in the form of inclusion bodies. Inclusion bodies were washed, solubilized in 6 m GdnHCl, pH 8, dialyzed against deionized water, and the precipitate (>95% pure) was used in assays. Recombinant human PrP (amino acids 23–230 and 90–230) forms were expressed in E. coli in form of inclusion bodies and purified (10Zahn R. von Schroetter C. Wuthrich K. FEBS Lett. 1997; 417: 400-404Google Scholar). Preparation of Different Structural Forms of Prion Protein—Several structural forms of human recPrP (23–230) (Prionics) were produced to test the reactivity of V5B2 toward them. Human recPrP (0.2 mg/ml) was unfolded by overnight incubation at room temperature in 4.8 m GdnHCl, 100 mm dithiothreitol, and 16 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8. Buffer was exchanged to 50 mm sodium acetate pH 4, to maintain the cysteine residues in a reduced state. Thermal denaturation was performed by heating the protein solution for 6 min at 95 °C. Oligomers of PrP with a high content of β-sheet structure were formed by the following reaction conditions: 1 or 3.5 m urea, 0.15 m NaCl, 50 mm sodium acetate pH 4 or 8 (11Morillas M. Vanik D.L. Surewicz W.K. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6982-6987Google Scholar); 1 m GdnHCl, 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 4 (12Swietnicki W. Morillas M. Chen S.G. Gambetti P. Surewicz W.K. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 424-431Google Scholar); or reduction in 4 m urea, pH 4 (13Jackson G.S. Hosszu L.L. Power A. Hill A.F. Kenney J. Saibil H. Craven C.J. Waltho J.P. Clarke A.R. Collinge J. Science. 1999; 283: 1935-1937Google Scholar), and reduced PrP in 0.1% or trifluoroacetic acid, pH 2 (34Lu B.Y. Chang J.Y. Biochem. J. 2002; 364: 81-87Google Scholar). Monoclonal Antibody V5B2 Prepared against a Synthetic Peptide in BALB/c Mice—Of the three peptides based on the sequence of human PrP used for immunization (see “Experimental Procedures”), the best results were obtained with a 13-residue synthetic peptide from the C-terminal part of human PrP (amino acids 214–226). We have selected this region of PrP because it is part of the protease-resistant structure as determined by reactivity with mAb raised against the peptide 218–232 (14Horiuchi M. Caughey B. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3193-3203Google Scholar). This part of the molecule has already been shown to be promising for its immunogenicity and specificity (6Korth C. Stierli B. Streit P. Moser M. Schaller O. Fischer R. Schulz-Schaeffer W. Kretzschmar H. Raeber A. Braun U. Ehrensperger F. Hornemann S. Glockshuber R. Riek R. Billeter M. Wuthrich K. Oesch B. Nature. 1997; 390: 74-77Google Scholar, 7Korth C. Streit P. Oesch B. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 309: 106-122Google Scholar, 15Takahashi H. Takahashi R.H. Hasegawa H. Horiuchi M. Shinagawa M. Yokoyama T. Kimura K. Haritani M. Kurata T. Nagashima K. J. Neurovirol. 1999; 5: 300-307Google Scholar). BLAST search showed that the sequence of our immunizing peptide is unique to prion proteins, and the most similar segment among the human non-prion sequences differed at 6 of 13 residues. Polyclonal antibodies against a slightly larger peptide from this region of the bovine molecule reacted with PrPC but not with PrPSc (15Takahashi H. Takahashi R.H. Hasegawa H. Horiuchi M. Shinagawa M. Yokoyama T. Kimura K. Haritani M. Kurata T. Nagashima K. J. Neurovirol. 1999; 5: 300-307Google Scholar). Three epitopes, described as specific for bovine PrPSc, have been defined, one of which is located in the same region of the protein (6Korth C. Stierli B. Streit P. Moser M. Schaller O. Fischer R. Schulz-Schaeffer W. Kretzschmar H. Raeber A. Braun U. Ehrensperger F. Hornemann S. Glockshuber R. Riek R. Billeter M. Wuthrich K. Oesch B. Nature. 1997; 390: 74-77Google Scholar, 7Korth C. Streit P. Oesch B. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 309: 106-122Google Scholar). Prnp0/0 mice and the recombinant bovine prion protein were a prerequisite for developing an mAb with this specificity. Additionally, the presence of glutamate and multiple tyrosines (two and three of each, respectively, in our peptide) has been reported to be favorable in stimulating production of conformationally specific antibodies (16Price K.M. Ritter M.A. Ladyman H.M. Monoclonal Antibodies: Production, Engineering, and Clinical Applications. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK1995: 60-82Google Scholar). Immunization with this peptide resulted in a strong immune response in all the injected BALB/c mice. Over 2000 hybridomas were prepared from three fusions and, of the 44 clones that produced antibodies reactive against P1, three were found to distinguish between PrPSc and PrPC. ELISA, dot blot, Western blot, and IHC were used to select mAb V5B2 from a number of mAbs of different specificity for PrPC or PrPSc. PrPSc Selectivity of V5B2—V5B2 was found to distinguish reproducibly between normal and CJD brain homogenates in dot blot analysis (Fig. 1a). This is in sharp distinction to mAb 3F4 (Senetec, Maryland Heights, MO, and Dako), the widely accepted reference antibody for prion detection (17Kascsak R.J. Rubenstein R. Merz P.A. Tonna-DeMasi M. Fersko R. Carp R.I. Wisniewski H.M. Diringer H. J. Virol. 1987; 61: 3688-3693Google Scholar), which displayed strong reactivity with non-CJD as well as pathological brain homogenate (Fig. 1b). Sandwich ELISA, employing commercially available mAb 6H4 (6Korth C. Stierli B. Streit P. Moser M. Schaller O. Fischer R. Schulz-Schaeffer W. Kretzschmar H. Raeber A. Braun U. Ehrensperger F. Hornemann S. Glockshuber R. Riek R. Billeter M. Wuthrich K. Oesch B. Nature. 1997; 390: 74-77Google Scholar) as the capture antibody and V5B2 as the detection antibody, gave a strong signal with the brain homogenate from CJD-affected brain, unlike that from non-CJD brain without proteinase K digestion (Fig. 2), demonstrating that the target of V5B2 in tissue is indeed PrPSc characteristic for the prion disease and is not found in normal brain. V5B2 gave no reaction on Western blot analysis with extracts from CJD and non-CJD brain subjected to denaturing SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3), as expected for a conformational antibody. mAb 3F4 was used as a positive control. V5B2 conjugated to magnetic beads precipitated PrP from CJD-affected, but not normal brain homogenate (Fig. 4), confirming the specificity of V5B2.Fig. 2Sandwich ELISA discriminates between CJD-positive and -negative tissue. sCJD-positive (sCJD) and -negative (neg.) human brain homogenates tested with sandwich ELISA composed of 6H4 as the capture and the V5B2-HRP conjugate as the reporter antibody, showing the specific reactivity of V5B2 with PrPSc in sCJD-positive samples without treatment with proteinase K.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Fig. 3Western blot of sCJD-positive (sCJD) and negative (neg.) human brain homogenates under denaturing conditions.

Homogenates contained comparable total amounts of protein in controls (CJD+ and CJD-) as well as in homogenates used in immunoprecipitation. V5B2 magnetic beads were a negative control without brain homogenate. PrP was detected by direct immunoblotting with 3F4.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Additional confirmation of the selectivity of V5B2 for PrPSc and a demonstration of its usefulness come from its strong and selective labeling of PrPSc aggregates in unfixed, thaw-mounted cryosections of human brain tissue from CJD cases (Fig. 5a). No labeling occurred with normal human brain tissue (Fig. 5b) or with brain tissue from other neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease (not shown). In contrast, strong, non-selective labeling of tissue components in parallel tissue cryosections of both CJD (Fig. 5c) and non-CJD (Fig. 5d) brain was obtained with mAb 3F4. The conformational epitope was still recognized by V5B2 after paraformaldehyde fixation and could be detected in sections from paraffin-embedded fixed brains (Fig. 5e), even when a direct method of immunodetection was used in which V5B2 was directly conjugated with HRP without additional amplification of the signal through the secondary antibody and the avidin-biotin complex (Fig. 5f). Inclusion of a formic acid incubation step in the antigen retrieval pre-treatment protocol further enhanced V5B2 immunoreactivity with the CJD brain sections, permitting detection of fine, “synaptic” type prion deposits (Fig. 5g). V5B2 was also tested on fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections from vCJD, where it displayed strong immunoreactivity to prion aggregates (Fig. 5h). We have also found that mAb V5B2 can be used to diagnose BSE and scrapie in the brain tissue of infected cattle and sheep (data not shown). mAb V5B2 Does Not React with Any Form of Recombinant PrP—V5B2 did not bind to human or bovine recPrP in either dot blot or ELISA despite the presence of the identical peptide sequence at the C terminus, although it bound to the immunogenic peptide and its conjugate to KLH. To test whether the antibody would recognize the aggregated protein, we prepared human recPrP in the form of insoluble inclusion bodies, but there was no reaction with V5B2 although, as a control, there was strong reaction with 3F4 (Fig. 6). Additionally, we have fused the peptide to the C terminus of ketosteroid-isomerase to test whether the non-reactivity against PrP inclusion bodies might be due to its inaccessibility in the aggregated form. This fusion protein also formed inclusion bodies but, in contrast, reacted strongly with V5B2. These results indicate that some of the residues of the peptide that react with V5B2 are buried in the native conformation of the recPrP and PrPC as well as in denatured aggregated PrP. These results indicate that the conformation of the peptide in the form that reacts with V5B2 differs from that in recPrP and PrPC as well as in denatured aggregated PrP. Circular dichroism and NMR spectra and the prediction of the α-helical content of the peptide by AGADIR (18Munoz V. Serrano L. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 245: 275-296Google Scholar) (not shown) indicate that the short immunizing peptide itself does not possess an α-helical structure but is disordered in solution whereas, when it is part of the protein it is stabilized in a defined conformation by long range interactions. recPrP has been subjected to a variety of denaturing conditions that were shown previously to cause a transition in vitro to a conformation with a high content of β-structure with subsequent aggregation (11Morillas M. Vanik D.L. Surewicz W.K. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6982-6987Google Scholar, 13Jackson G.S. Hosszu L.L. Power A. Hill A.F. Kenney J. Saibil H. Craven C.J. Waltho J.P. Clarke A.R. Collinge J. Science. 1999; 283: 1935-1937Google Scholar, 19Lu B.Y. Chang J.Y. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 13390-13396Google Scholar). These conditions included intermediate or high concentrations of urea and GdnHCl, low pH, and the presence of salt or reducing agents (see “Experimental Procedures”). None of these conditions resulted in any reactivity with V5B2 (not shown). Particularly for the transplantation and transfusion services there is an urgent need for fast, preferably pre mortem diagnostics that require antibodies that react specifically with the PrPSc without any pretreatment. Sandwich ELISA, as described in the present paper and which uses the PrPSc-specific antibody V5B2, distinguishes well between samples from normal and CJD-affected patients and is a useful tool for fast diagnosis. In contrast to other assays such as the conformation-dependent assay (20Safar J. Wille H. Itri V. Groth D. Serban H. Torchia M. Cohen F.E. Prusiner S.B. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 1157-1165Google Scholar), where the content of PrPSc is estimated from the difference in reactivity between the native and denatured sample or by degradation of PrPC by proteinase K, our assay estimates directly the content of PrPSc in the presence of PrPC. The sequence of the immunizing peptide partially overlaps with the conformational epitope of the previously reported PrPSc-specific mAb, 15B3 (6Korth C. Stierli B. Streit P. Moser M. Schaller O. Fischer R. Schulz-Schaeffer W. Kretzschmar H. Raeber A. Braun U. Ehrensperger F. Hornemann S. Glockshuber R. Riek R. Billeter M. Wuthrich K. Oesch B. Nature. 1997; 390: 74-77Google Scholar, 7Korth C. Streit P. Oesch B. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 309: 106-122Google Scholar). However, the latter mAb has never been available for either research or diagnostic purposes and has not been shown to work in immunohistochemical detection of PrPSc. While our manuscript was under revision, another paper reporting PrPSc-specific antibodies appeared (21Paramithiotis E. Pinard M. Lawton T. LaBoissiere S. Leathers V.L. Zou W.Q. Estey L.A. Lamontagne J. Lehto M.T. Kondejewski L.H. Francoeur G.P. Papadopoulos M. Haghighat A. Spatz S.J. Head M. Will R. Ironside J. O'Rourke K. Tonelli Q. Ledebur H.C. Chakrabartty A. Cashman N.R. Nat. Med. 2003; 9: 893-899Google Scholar). Paramithiotis et al. report that antibodies against the Tyr-Tyr-Arg motif are selective for the misfolded conformation of PrP. A similar sequence is present at the C terminus of our peptide, suggesting that both antibodies may recognize the same region of the protein. Although the conformational transition in PrP is believed to occur mainly in the N-terminal part of the structured domain, the region of PrP from which the peptide of this study originates has attracted attention before. The largest differences in the conformation of the structured domains of PrPC (amino acids 121–231) from different species are observed at the end of the C-terminal helix, which is less structured in murine than in human and bovine PrP (22Zahn R. Liu A. Luhrs T. Riek R. von Schroetter C. Lopez G.F. Billeter M. Calzolai L. Wider G. Wuthrich K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 145-150Google Scholar, 23Billeter M. Riek R. Wider G. Hornemann S. Glockshuber R. Wuthrich K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7281-7285Google Scholar). NMR investigations of the full-length PrP have indicated that the disordered N-terminal tail probably interacts with the residues at the end of the third helix (22Zahn R. Liu A. Luhrs T. Riek R. von Schroetter C. Lopez G.F. Billeter M. Calzolai L. Wider G. Wuthrich K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 145-150Google Scholar). Our results provide evidence that the conformation at the C terminus of PrPSc differs from the α-helical conformation of PrPC. Analysis of inter-helical contacts in PrPC indicate that any structural transformation of helix 2, which is believed to be frustrated, would affect the third helix, particularly its C terminus (24Dima R.I. Thirumalai D. Biophys. J. 2002; 83: 1268-1280Google Scholar). Hydrogen exchange experiments have shown that even unfolded PrP retains an extremely stable core of ∼10 residues around the disulfide bond, of which most are part of the peptide of this study (25Hosszu L.L. Baxter N.J. Jackson G.S. Power A. Clarke A.R. Waltho J.P. Craven C.J. Collinge J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 740-743Google Scholar). It is likely, therefore, that this region nucleates the rapid refolding on removal of denaturants, which explains the masking of the epitope for V5B2. The region C-terminal to our peptide (amino acids 225–231) was shown to be accessible in both PrPSc and PrPC (26Peretz D. Williamson R.A. Matsunaga Y. Serban H. Pinilla C. Bastidas R.B. Rozenshteyn R. James T.L. Houghten R.A. Cohen F.E. Prusiner S.B. Burton D.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 614-622Google Scholar), which indicates that only part of the helix 3 is in different conformation or, alternatively, that an insufficient number of hybridomas were screened. Several mAbs have been characterized that are reactive against both PrPC and denatured PrPSc, indicating that denaturation disrupts the specific metastable conformation of PrPSc and that refolding takes place, on removal of denaturant, to a PrPC-like conformation (26Peretz D. Williamson R.A. Matsunaga Y. Serban H. Pinilla C. Bastidas R.B. Rozenshteyn R. James T.L. Houghten R.A. Cohen F.E. Prusiner S.B. Burton D.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 614-622Google Scholar). V5B2 is, in this respect, directly opposite to those antibodies, recognizing PrPSc but not PrPC or denatured PrPSc. The conformation of PrPSc can be disrupted with strong denaturants that inactivate its infectivity irreversibly (27Gasset M. Baldwin M.A. Fletterick R.J. Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1-5Google Scholar). We have observed that the specific conformation of PrPSc was disrupted and the reactivity with V5B2 was eliminated by treatment with SDS and NaOH but not by boiling (data not shown), conditions which have been shown to decrease or destroy the infectivity of PrPSc (2Prusiner S.B. Science. 1982; 216: 136-144Google Scholar). It has been suggested that the high content of the β-structure and the ability to aggregate are not sufficient for the onset of the disease. Binding of additional components present in tissue, such as a putative factor X, may be necessary for keeping the C-terminal part of PrP in the conformation recognized by V5B2. Involvement of this region in the species barrier and interaction with a putative factor X has been suggested previously (28Telling G.C. Scott M. Mastrianni J. Gabizon R. Torchia M. Cohen F.E. DeArmond S.J. Prusiner S.B. Cell. 1995; 83: 79-90Google Scholar, 29Kaneko K. Zulianello L. Scott M. Cooper C.M. Wallace A.C. James T.L. Cohen F.E. Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10069-10074Google Scholar). Interestingly, quinacrine, proposed for treatment of CJD, also binds to the Tyr-Tyr motif at the end of P1 (30Vogtherr M. Grimme S. Elshorst B. Jacobs D.M. Fiebig K. Griesinger C. Zahn R. J. Med. Chem. 2003; 46: 3563-3564Google Scholar). Finally, the alleles Q218K in mouse and E219K in human, which are located in the immunogenic peptide, protect against occurrence of the disease (31Perrier V. Kaneko K. Safar J. Vergara J. Tremblay P. DeArmond S.J. Cohen F.E. Prusiner S.B. Wallace A.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 13079-13084Google Scholar, 32Shibuya S. Higuchi J. Shin R.W. Tateishi J. Kitamoto T. Ann. Neurol. 1998; 43: 826-828Google Scholar). Peptides from the C terminus and antibodies against this region have been shown to prevent formation of PrP aggregates in vivo (33Horiuchi M. Baron G.S. Xiong L.W. Caughey B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15489-15497Google Scholar), and, in view of the strong immunogenicity of the peptide reported in this study, it warrants evaluation as a potential vaccine. We show that mAb V5B2 recognizes specifically the conformation of the C-terminal region of the PrPSc isoform, which differs from the PrPC. V5B2 does not react with recombinant PrP, regardless of treatment. The potent PrPSc-specific mAb V5B2 permits easy detection of PrPSc by standard immunohistochemical procedures on tissue from CJD patients' in dot blot assays or ELISA. Its production does not require the use of knock-out mice (6Korth C. Stierli B. Streit P. Moser M. Schaller O. Fischer R. Schulz-Schaeffer W. Kretzschmar H. Raeber A. Braun U. Ehrensperger F. Hornemann S. Glockshuber R. Riek R. Billeter M. Wuthrich K. Oesch B. Nature. 1997; 390: 74-77Google Scholar, 7Korth C. Streit P. Oesch B. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 309: 106-122Google Scholar), and, being sub-class IgG1, it is suitable for improved immunodiagnostic procedures and possibly novel treatment options for TSE in humans as well as in animals. Finally, the results show that V5B2 is a potentially valuable tool for TSE research and may help to identify and manipulate the region of PrP, which experiences a change in conformation during the transition to the pathological form.

https://openalex.org/W2000071456,"Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) is a potent mitogen and chemoattractant for vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs) whose biological activity is mediated via its high affinity interaction with specific cell surface receptors. The molecular mechanisms governing the expression of PDGF receptor-α (PDGFR-α) are poorly understood. Here we demonstrate that PDGFR-α protein and transcriptional regulation in SMCs is under the positive regulatory influence of the zinc finger nuclear protein, Sp1. Electrophoretic mobility shift, competition, and supershift analysis revealed the existence of an atypical G-rich Sp1-binding element located in the PDGFR-α promoter –61 to –52 bp upstream of the transcriptional start site. Mutation of this sequence ablated endogenous Sp1 binding and activation of the PDGFR-α promoter. PDGFR-α transcription, mRNA, and protein expression were repressed in SMCs exposed to fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2). This inhibition was rescued by the blockade of extracellular signal-regulated kinase-1/2 (ERK1/2). FGF-2 repression of PDGFR-α transcription was abrogated upon mutation of this Sp1-response element. FGF-2 stimulated Sp1 phosphorylation in an ERK1/2- but not p38-dependent manner, the growth factor enhancing Sp1 interaction with the PDGFR-α promoter. Mutation of residues Thr453 and Thr739 in Sp1 (amino acids phosphorylated by ERK) blocked FGF-2 repression of PDGFR-α transcription. These findings, taken together, demonstrate that FGF-2 stimulates ERK1/2-dependent Sp1 phosphorylation, thereby repressing PDGFR-α transcription via the –61/–52 element in the PDGFR-α promoter. Phosphorylation triggered by FGF-2 switches Sp1 from an activator to a repressor of PDGFR-α transcription, a finding previously unreported in any Sp1-dependent gene. Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) is a potent mitogen and chemoattractant for vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs) whose biological activity is mediated via its high affinity interaction with specific cell surface receptors. The molecular mechanisms governing the expression of PDGF receptor-α (PDGFR-α) are poorly understood. Here we demonstrate that PDGFR-α protein and transcriptional regulation in SMCs is under the positive regulatory influence of the zinc finger nuclear protein, Sp1. Electrophoretic mobility shift, competition, and supershift analysis revealed the existence of an atypical G-rich Sp1-binding element located in the PDGFR-α promoter –61 to –52 bp upstream of the transcriptional start site. Mutation of this sequence ablated endogenous Sp1 binding and activation of the PDGFR-α promoter. PDGFR-α transcription, mRNA, and protein expression were repressed in SMCs exposed to fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2). This inhibition was rescued by the blockade of extracellular signal-regulated kinase-1/2 (ERK1/2). FGF-2 repression of PDGFR-α transcription was abrogated upon mutation of this Sp1-response element. FGF-2 stimulated Sp1 phosphorylation in an ERK1/2- but not p38-dependent manner, the growth factor enhancing Sp1 interaction with the PDGFR-α promoter. Mutation of residues Thr453 and Thr739 in Sp1 (amino acids phosphorylated by ERK) blocked FGF-2 repression of PDGFR-α transcription. These findings, taken together, demonstrate that FGF-2 stimulates ERK1/2-dependent Sp1 phosphorylation, thereby repressing PDGFR-α transcription via the –61/–52 element in the PDGFR-α promoter. Phosphorylation triggered by FGF-2 switches Sp1 from an activator to a repressor of PDGFR-α transcription, a finding previously unreported in any Sp1-dependent gene.

Westermark B. Physiol. Reviews. 1999; 79: 1283-1300Crossref PubMed Scopus (1996) Google Scholar) whose biological activity is mediated via high affinity interactions with specific protein-tyrosine kinase cell surface receptors, PDGFR-α and -β. PDGFs are secreted as disulfide-linked bivalent ligands that induce receptor dimerization, trans-phosphorylation, and the activation of signal transduction cascades (2.van der Geer P. Hunter T. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 251-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (1252) Google Scholar). PDGFR-α and -β have different ligand binding capabilities for their ligands. PDGFR-α binds PDGF-A, PDGF-B, and PDGF-C, whereas PDGFR-β binds PDGF-B and PDGF-D (3.Betsholtz C Karlsson L Lindahl P. BioEssays. 2001; 23: 494-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Assembly of the receptor dimer combinations (PDGFR-αα, -αβ, -ββ) is dependent on the isoform of the dimeric ligand (3.Betsholtz C Karlsson L Lindahl P. BioEssays. 2001; 23: 494-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Consequently, PDGF-AA causes αα receptor complex formation, PDGF-AB induces αα or αβ, and PDGF-BB stimulates αα, αβ, or ββ (4.Heldin C.H. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4251-4259Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 5.Eriksson A. Siegbahn A. Westermark B. Heldin C.H. Claesson-Welsh L.

PDGF and fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2) have long been recognized to play a regulatory role in vascular pathologies such as atherosclerosis and postangioplasty restenosis involving smooth muscle cell (SMC) growth. Both these growth factors and their receptors are expressed in SMCs. SMC replication and matrix deposition lead to lesion formation and thickening of the artery wall (9.Dzau V.J. Gibbons G.H. Morishita R. Pratt R.E. Hypertension. 1994; 23: 1132-1140Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Conversely, SMC apoptosis can weaken the atherosclerotic plaque and lead to its rupture (10.Bennett M.R. Boyle J.J. Atherosclerosis. 1998; 138: 3-9Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 11.Rossig L. Dimmeler S. Zeiher A.M. Basic Res. Cardiol. 2001; 96: 11-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Interestingly, as the plaque develops from early to late stage, FGF-2 levels decrease (12.Hughes S.E. Crossman D. Hall P.A. Cardiovasc. Res. 1993; 27: 1214-1219Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), whereas PDGFR-α levels increase (13.Irvine C.D. George S.J. Sheffield E. Johnson J.L. Davies A.H. Lamont P.M. Cardiovasc. Res. 2000; 8: 121-129Google Scholar). Beyond this, however, an interrelationship between FGF-2 and PDGFR-α has not been established. The molecular mechanisms governing the transcription of PDGFR-α are poorly understood. The PDGFR-α gene lacks a typical TATA box but contains GATA motifs and a CCAAT box. It also contains potential sites for AP-1, AP-2, Oct-1, and Oct-2 transcription factors (14.Kawagishi J. Kumabe T. Yoshimoto T. Tamamoto T. Genomics. 1995; 30: 224-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). CCAAT/enhancer-binding proteins C/EBP-β and C/EBP-δ bind to the PDGFR-α promoter and modulate its activity both positively and negatively (15.Fukuoka T. Kitami Y. Okura T. Hiwada K. J. Biol.

Res. 1999; 84: 64-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). For example, IL-1β can induce PDGFR-α mRNA expression via induction of C/EBP-δ (15.Fukuoka T. Kitami Y. Okura T. Hiwada K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25576-25582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 16.Kitami Y. Fukuoka T. Hiwada K. Inagami T. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 64-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). PDGFR-α is under the positive transcriptional influence of NF-κB (17.Lindroos P.M. Rice A.B. Wang Y.Z. Bonner J.C. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 3464-3468PubMed Google Scholar). The proto-oncogene product Cbl negatively regulates PDGFR-α by enhancing ubiquitination and degradation (18.Miyake S. Mullane-Robinson K.P. Lill N.L. Douillard P. Band H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16619-16628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Deletion of PDGFR-α in mice produces severe cardiovascular abnormalities among many other defects, leading to embryonic death at day 8–16 (19.Li X. Ponten A. Aase K. Karlsson L. Abramsson A.

Our previous studies have demonstrated that the zinc finger transcription factor Sp1 regulates transcription of the PDGF-A and PDGF-B genes in SMCs and in other vascular cell types (20.Khachigian L.M.

Here we show that PDGFR-α expression in SMCs is under the positive regulatory influence of Sp1, via an atypical recognition element located –61/–52 bp upstream of the transcriptional start site. This site mediates FGF-2 repression of PDGFR-α expression in an ERK1/2-dependent manner. Phosphorylation of Sp1 upon exposure to FGF-2 switches Sp1 from an activator to a repressor of PDGFR-α transcription. Cell Culture—WKY12-22 rat aortic SMCs were cultured in Waymouth's MB752/1 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 30 μg/ml l-glutamine, 10 units/ml penicillin, and 10 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C and 5% CO2. The cells were passaged every 3–4 days in 75-cm2 flasks. Plasmid Constructs—The plasmid pLuc-a2 (23.Kitami Y. Inui H. Uno S. Inagami T. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 558-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), containing the promoter region of platelet-derived growth factor receptor-α, was kindly donated by Dr Yutaka Kitami from Ehime University School of Medicine, Ehime, Japan. pLuc-a2.Sp1m3 and CMV-Sp1.mThr453/mThr739 were produced using the QuikChange® XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. Thr453 was converted to Ala453, and Thr739 was changed to Ala739. The primers are as follows: Sp1m3 forward, 5′-TTTATTTTGAAGAGACCATTTTTTTTTTCTTCATTTCCTGACAGCT-3′; Sp1m3 reverse, 5′ AGCTGTCAGGAAATGAAGAAAAAAAAAATGGTCTCTTCAAAATAAA-3′. CMV-Sp1.mThr453/mThr739 mutant was constructed by performing two mutagenesis reactions, each followed by sequencing, to obtain the double mutant. The primers are as follows: Sp1mThr453 forward, 5′-CCCATCATCATCCGGGCACCAACAGTGGGG-3′; Sp1mThr453 reverse, 5′-CCCCGCTGTTGGTGCCCGGATGATGATGGG-3′; Sp1mThr739 forward, 5′-GGCAGTGGCACTGCCGCTCCTTCAFCCCTTATT-3′; Sp1mThr739 reverse, 5′-AATAAGGGCTGAAGGAGCGGCAGTGGCACTGCC-3′. Transient Transfections—For reporter gene analysis, WKY12-22 cells were transfected with 10 μg of pLuc-a2, pLuc-a2.Sp1m3, or CMV-Sp1.mThr453/mThr739. Cells were also transfected with 0.5 μg of pRL-TK to correct for transfection efficiency. Firefly luciferase activity was normalized to Renilla. Transient transfections were performed using FuGENE6 (Roche Applied Science) where 3 μl of FuGENE6/μg of transfected DNA was added, and the transfection mix was made up to 1 ml with serum-free medium. After incubation at 22 °C for 10 min, the DNA/FuGENE6 mixture was added to cells containing 10 ml of complete medium. Twenty-four h after transfection, cell lysates were prepared for assessment of luciferase activity where the dual luciferase assay reporter system (Promega DLR™) was performed on a manual luminometer (model TD-20/20 Turner Designs, Quantum Science). mRNA Expression Analysis—Cells were washed two times with ice-cold PBS and harvested with 4.5 ml of TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. cDNA synthesis from total RNA was performed using Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Promega, WI) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. Thermal cycling conditions as follows: PDGFR-α 94 °C for 10 s, 62 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 1.5 min for 40 cycles; GAPDH 94 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 30 s, 68 °C for 2 min for 18, 24, and 28 cycles. The PDGFR-α primers are: 5′-AGATAGCTTCATGAGCCGAC-3′ (forward) and 5′-GGAACAGGGTCAATGTCTGG-3′ (reverse); the GAPDH primers are: 5′-ACCACAGTCCATGCCATCAC-3′ (forward) and 5′-TCCACCACCCTGTTGCTGTA-3′ (reverse). Western Immunoblot Analysis—Transfected cells were washed two times with ice-cold PBS before being lysed on ice in 1× radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) containing protease inhibitors (2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 5 mm EDTA, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1% aprotinin). Cell lysates were collected after centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C, and the protein concentration was determined by BCA protein assay (Pierce). Lysates containing 10 μg of protein were prepared in SDS sample buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, 2% SDS, 0.01% bromphenol blue, and 30 mm dithiothreitol (DTT)) and boiled for 5 min with 0.5 m iodoacetamide added before loading onto an 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Gels were blotted onto Immobilon-P (polyvinylidene difluoride) membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA) and blocked overnight at 4 °C in 5% skim milk powder, 0.05% Tween 20, and PBS. Sp1 was detected using rabbit polyclonal antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and chemiluminescence detection (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Preparation of Nuclear Extracts—SMC monolayers were washed two times with ice-cold PBS, pH 7.4, and then scraped into 10 ml of cold PBS. The cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 250 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Cells were lysed by the addition of ice-cold hypotonic solution (Buffer A) consisting of 10 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mm DTT, 200 mm sucrose, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mm PMSF, 1 μg/ml aprotinin. The suspension was recentrifuged, and the nuclei were lysed in an ice-cold solution (Buffer C) consisting of 20 mm HEPES, pH 8, 100 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 20% glycerol, 1 mm DTT, 0.5 mm PMSF, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin. The nuclear fraction was combined with an equal volume of Buffer D (20 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 100 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 20% glycerol, 1 mm DTT, 0.5 mm PMSF, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—Binding reactions for gel shift assays were performed in 20 μl of 10 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 5% glycerol, 1 mm PMSF, 1 μg of salmon sperm DNA (Sigma), 32P-labeled oligonucleotide probe (150,000 cpm), and 3 μg of nuclear extract (determined by Pierce protein assay). The reaction was incubated for 35 min at 22 °C. In supershift studies, 2 μl of the appropriate affinity-purified anti-peptide polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was incubated with the binding mix for 10 min before the addition of the probe. Bound complexes were separated from free probe by loading samples onto a 6% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel and electrophoresing at 120 V for 2.5 h. The gels were vacuum-dried at 80 °C and subjected to autoradiography overnight at –80 °C. Sp1 Positively Regulates PDGFR-α Transcription and Protein Expression—Our previous investigations demonstrated a positive regulatory role for Sp1 in the transcriptional regulation of PDGF A- (22.Khachigian L.M.

Science. 1996; 271: 1427-1431Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar) via cis-acting elements in the proximal promoter regions of these genes. Unlike the PDGF-A and -B promoters, however, consensus elements for Sp1 do not appear in the proximal PDGFR-α promoter. Whether Sp1 controls PDGFR-α expression has not been investigated in any cell type. We assessed levels of PDGFR-α protein in vascular SMCs 24 h after transfection with the CMV-based Sp1 expression vector, CMV-Sp1. Western immunoblot analysis revealed that Sp1 overexpression produced a discreet band of molecular mass 170 kDa (Fig. 1A), which was barely apparent in cells transfected with the backbone vector, pcDNA3 (Fig. 1A). To confirm these observations at the level of transcription, we co-transfected SMCs with CMV-Sp1 and pLuc-a2, a Firefly luciferase-based reporter construct driven by 1.3 kb of PDGFR-α promoter (23.Kitami Y. Inui H. Uno S. Inagami T. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 558-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The cells were also transfected with the Renilla luciferase-based construct to correct for transfection efficiency. Normalized luciferase activity 24 h after transfection revealed dose-dependent induction of PDGFR-α transcription by Sp1 (Fig. 1B). An Atypical Sp1-binding Motif in the PDGFRα Promoter Serves as a Functional Sp1-response Element—The proximal region of the PDGFR-α promoter does not contain a consensus Sp1-binding motif (5′-GGGCGG-3′). However, a G-box comprising 10 consecutive guanines was present at position –61G10–52, relative to the transcriptional start site (Fig. 2). To determine whether this site could support an interaction with Sp1, we performed an electrophoretic mobility shift assay using SMC nuclear extracts and a 32P-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide (32P-PDGFR-α oligonucleotide –80/–33) whose sequence spans bp –80/–33 in the PDGFR-α promoter. This produced a number of nucleoprotein complexes (C1–C4) whose specificity was demonstrated by their abrogation in the presence of a 150-fold molar excess of unlabeled oligonucleotide (Fig. 3, UL). The same -fold excess of an irrelevant oligonucleotide containing the NF-κB-binding site failed to change the profile of these complexes (Fig. 3). Transverse mutation of the 5′-G10-3′ (–61G10–52 to –61T10–52) motif in the oligonucleotide abrogated complex formation (Fig. 3, 32P-Mutant PDGFR-α Oligo –80/–33). Incubation of extracts with antibodies to Sp1 eliminated complexes C1 and C3 and decreased the intensity of complexes C2 and C4 (Fig. 3), whereas antibodies to Ets-1 had no effect (Fig. 3). Thus, endogenous Sp1 protein interacts with this atypical Sp1 element in the PDGFR-α promoter in a sequence-specific manner.Fig. 3Atypical Sp1-binding element in the PDGFR-α promoter interacts with endogenous Sp1. This figure shows an electrophoretic mobility shift assay using 32P-labeled oligonucleotide spanning the –80/–33 region (32P-Mutant PDGFR-α Oligo –80/–33) of the PDGFR-α promoter or the 32P-labeled mutant (G10 → T10) oligonucleotide and SMC nuclear extracts. Supershift analysis with Sp1 antibodies abrogates complexes C1 and C3 and decreases intensity of C2 and C4, whereas Ets-1 antibodies have no effect. UL, unlabeled oligonucleotide.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To establish the functional significance of this atypical Sp1-binding element in the context of 1.3 kb of the PDGFR-α promoter, the same transverse mutation was introduced into pLuc-a2 (pLuc-a2.Sp1m3). Co-transfection analysis with CMV-Sp1 or pcDNA3 in SMCs together with mutant pLuc-a2.Sp1m3 completely abrogated Sp1 induction of the PDGFR-α promoter (Fig. 4). These findings thus demonstrate the existence of a novel Sp1-response element in the proximal region of the PDGFR-α promoter. FGF-2 Represses PDGFR-α Transcription, mRNA, and Protein Expression—PDGFR-α levels progressively decrease in the growing atheroma as levels of FGF-2 increase (12.Hughes S.E. Crossman D. Hall P.A. Cardiovasc. Res. 1993; 27: 1214-1219Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 13.Irvine C.D. George S.J. Sheffield E. Johnson J.L. Davies A.H. Lamont P.M. Cardiovasc. Res. 2000; 8: 121-129Google Scholar). We hypothesized that FGF-2 may negatively influence PDGFR-α expression. Whether a growth factor can repress the expression of the receptor of another has not been demonstrated previously. Luciferase activity in SMCs transfected with pLuc-a2 was reduced by FGF-2 in a dose-dependent manner within 24 h (Fig. 5A). Semiquantitative reverse-transcriptase-PCR analysis confirmed these data. FGF-2 repressed endogenous PDGFR-α mRNA expression 24 h after exposure of the cells to the growth factor (Fig. 5B, left panel). Corresponding GAPDH transcript levels demonstrated unbiased sample loading (Fig. 5B, right panel). Western blot analysis further revealed FGF-2 suppression of PDGFR-α protein expression, after 8 and 24 h of incubation with FGF-2 (Fig. 6, left panel). These findings indicate that FGF-2 inhibits PDGFR-α gene expression at the level of mRNA and protein.Fig. 6FGF-2-repression of PDGFR-α is ERK1/2-dependent. As shown in the left panel, FGF-2 suppression of PDGFR-α is rescued following treatment with PD98059. Western blot analysis using total cell extracts of SMCs exposed to FGF-2 for 8 or 24 h is shown. Cells were incubated with PD98059 (10 μm) or SB202190 (500 nm) for 1 h prior to the addition of FGF-2. As shown in the right panel, the ERK1/2 inhibitor rescues the PDGFR-α promoter from repression by FGF-2. Luciferase activity was measured following 24 h of FGF-2/PD98059 treatment. Firefly luciferase activity was normalized to Renilla. Error bars represent S.E. The data are representative of two or more independent determinations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) FGF-2 Repression of PDGFR-α Gene Expression Is Dependent on ERK1/2 but Not p38 MAP Kinase—We and others have demonstrated that a major signaling pathway used by FGF-2 in SMCs is the extracellular signal-regulated kinase-1/2 (ERK1/2) cascade (24.Pintucci G. Moscatelli D. Saponara F. Biernacki P.R. Baumann F.G. Bizekis C. Galloway A.C. Basilico C. Mignatti P. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 598-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 25.Enarsson M.

Western blot analysis revealed that FGF-2 repression of PDGFR-α protein expression was rescued by the MEK/ERK inhibitor PD98059 (10 μm) at 8 and 24 h (Fig. 6, left panel). In contrast, the p38 kinase inhibitor SB202190 (500 nm) failed to modulate FGF-2 down-regulation of PDGFR-α expression (Fig. 6, left panel). Reversibility of FGF-2 inhibition by the ERK1/2 inhibitor, but not the p38 inhibitor, was also demonstrated at the level of transcription in transfection analysis using pLuc-a2 (Fig. 6, right panel). FGF-2 Repression of PDGFR-α Transcription via Sp1 Repression Element—Previous studies have shown that activation of ERK1/2 can phosphorylate and alter the interaction of Sp1 with the promoters of responsive genes (28.Samson S.-L. Wong N.C. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 29: 265-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). For example, ERK1/2-phosphorylation of Sp1 increases its interaction with the gastrin gene promoter and augments epidermal growth factor-induced gastrin gene expression (29.Merchant J.L. Du M. Todisco A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 254: 454-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Whether ERK1/2-inducible Sp1 phosphorylation mediates repression of gene expression is presently not known. Since FGF-2 activates ERK1/2 (27.Santiago F.S. Lowe H.C. Day F.L. Chesterman C.N. Khachigian L.M. Am. J. Pathol. 1999; 154: 937-944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) and PD98059 reverses FGF-2 repression of the PDGFR-α promoter (Fig. 6, right panel), we hypothesized that FGF-2 inhibition of PDGFR-α is mediated via modification of Sp1. To begin to address this possibility, we exposed SMCs transfected with pLuc-a2.Sp1m3 to FGF-2 and assessed luciferase activity after 24 h (Fig. 7). FGF-2 down-regulation of PDGFR-α promoter activity was virtually abrogated by the mutation in the Sp1-binding site (Fig. 7). This novel Sp1-response element therefore mediates FGF-2 repression of the PDGFR-α promoter. We next investigated the effect of FGF-2 at the level of Sp1 protein. FGF-2 Stimulates Sp1 Phosphorylation in an ERK1/2-dependent Manner Increasing Sp1 Interaction with the PDGFR-α Promoter—Phosphorylation of Sp1 increases its molecular mass; the hyper- and hypo-phosphorylated forms can be readily resolved by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (30.Kavurma M.M. Bobryshev Y. Khachigian L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36244-36252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 31.Rafty L.A. Khachigian L.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 1027-1033Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Western blot analysis for Sp1 using nuclear extracts from SMCs treated with FGF-2 for 8 and 24 h demonstrated increased levels of Sp1 phosphorylation (Fig. 8A). Incubation of extracts from FGF-2-treated cells with calf intestinal phosphatase (CIP) eliminated the hyperphosphorylated form of this transcription factor, whereas incubation with bovine serum albumin (BSA) had no effect (Fig. 8A). These findings indicate, for the first time, that FGF-2 stimulates Sp1 phosphorylation. To demonstrate whether FGF-2 stimulates Sp1 phosphorylation via ERK1/2, SMCs were treated with PD98059 prior to the addition of FGF-2. Densitometric analysis after Western blotting for Sp1 revealed that FGF-2 phosphorylation of Sp1 was blocked by the ERK1/2 inhibitor (Fig. 8B). In contrast, the p38 inhibitor had no influence on the capacity of FGF-2 to phosphorylate Sp1 (Fig. 8B). Electrophoretic mobility shift assay with the 32P-labeled PDGFR-α oligonucleotide –80/–33 revealed the formation of an inducible (Ind) nucleoprotein complex within 8 h of incubation with FGF-2 (Fig. 8C). Supershift analysis with Sp1 antibodies eliminated the constitutive (C) and inducible complexes (Fig. 8C), whereas antibodies to Smad2 had no effect (Fig. 8C). Recently, it was shown that ERK1/2 phosphorylates two specific threonine residues (Thr453 and Thr739) in Sp1 (32.Milanini-Mongiat J. Pouyssegur J. Pages G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20631-20639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). We mutated these amino acids (to Ala) in full-length Sp1 to demonstrate whether FGF-2 down-regulation of PDGFR-α is critically dependent upon these residues. Transient transfection analysis in SMCs transfected with the CMV-Sp1 double mutant (CMV-Sp1.mThr453/mThr739) exposed to FGF-2 for 24 h revealed that FGF-2 could not suppress PDGFR-α transcription (Fig. 9). These findings, taken together, demonstrate that FGF-2 stimulates ERK1/2-dependent Sp1 phosphorylation, thereby repressing PDGFR-α transcription via the –61/–52 element in the PDGFR-α promoter. The integrity of Thr453 and Thr739 in Sp1 is critical to FGF-2 inhibition of PDGFR-α transcription. ERK1/2-dependent phosphorylation triggered by FGF-2 switches Sp1 from an activator to a repressor of PDGFR-α transcription. The transcriptional mechanisms regulating PDGFR-α expression are poorly understood. In this study, we demonstrate that PDGFR-α transcription and protein expression are activated by native Sp1, which binds to an atypical G-rich binding element located at –61/–52 bp in the PDGFR-α promoter. Interestingly, this element also mediates FGF-2 inhibition of PDGFR-α activity, which is reversed by mutation of the cis-acting element or blockade of ERK1/2 but not p38. Mutation of residues Thr453 and Thr739 in Sp1 that are phosphorylated by ERK1/2 abrogates FGF-2 repression of PDGFR-α transcription. Although native Sp1 activates PDGFR-α, Sp1 phosphorylation by FGF-2 increases its interaction with the PDGFR-α promoter, reducing its activity via this cis-acting element. Thus, Thr453/Thr739 phosphorylation switches Sp1 from an activator to a repressor of PDGFR-α transcription. This is the first report of Sp1 phosphorylation by FGF-2. It also demonstrates the capacity of a growth factor to regulate the expression of the receptor of another, as has been observed for the insulin-like growth factor-I receptor with PDGF (33.Rubini, M., Werner, H., Gandini, E., Roberts, C. T., Jr., LeRoith, D., and Baserga, R. (1994) Exp. Cell Res. 374–379Google Scholar) and FGF-2 (34.Hernandez-Sanchez C. Werner H. Roberts Jr., C.T. Woo E.J. Hum D.W. Rosenthal S.M. LeRoith D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4663-4670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). It is thus tempting to speculate that the inverse relationship between the expression of FGF-2 and PDGFR-α in the complex milieu of a developing atheroma may be mediated by the phosphorylation status of Sp1 and this novel recognition element in the PDGFR-α promoter."

APH-1 is known to be necessary for γ-secretase activity, but its precise function in the complex is not fully understood, and its membrane topology has not been described, although it is predicted to traverse the membrane seven times. To investigate this, we used selective permeabilization of the plasma membrane and immunofluorescence microscopy to show that the C terminus of the APH-1 resides in the cytosolic space. Insertion of N-linked glycosylation sites into each of the hydrophilic loop domains and the N terminus of APH-1 showed that the N-terminal domain as well as loops 2, 4, and 6 could be glycosylated, whereas loops 1, 3, and 5 were not. Thus, APH-1 topologically resembles a seven-transmembrane domain receptor with the N terminus and even-numbered loops facing the endoplasmic reticulum lumen, and the C terminus and odd-numbered loops reside in the cytosolic space. By using these glycosylation mutants, we provide evidence that the association between nicastrin and APH-1 may occur very soon after APH-1 synthesis and that the interaction between these two proteins may rely more heavily on the transmembrane domains of APH-1 than on the loop domains. Furthermore, we found that APH-1 can be processed by several endoproteolytic events. One of these cleavages is strongly up-regulated by co-expression of nicastrin and generates a stable C-terminal fragment that associates with nicastrin.

Understanding how the γ-secretase complex assembles and is regulated can provide information about its maturation, trafficking, activity, and substrate selectivity. An important step in understanding the role of APH-1 in the complex is to learn its topology within the membrane and to determine whether it undergoes post-translational processing events. Analysis of the APH-1 sequence shows that it contains seven potential TM domains of unknown orientation. By using glycosylation motif insertion mutagenesis combined with selective membrane permeabilization and immunofluorescence microscopy, we found that APH-1 does in fact traverse the membrane seven times, with the N-terminal domain facing the extracytosolic space and the C-terminal domain facing the cytosol. We also found that APH-1 can be processed by several endoproteolytic events, with one of these cleavages being strongly up-regulated by co-expression of Nct. The resulting C-terminal fragment is stable and binds Nct, raising the possibility that APH-1 function, like that of PS, may be modulated by endoproteolytic processing.

The APH-1 point mutations described in Fig. 1B were introduced by QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis with overlapping mismatched PCR primers using the APH-1aS-V5 plasmid as the template. Loop extensions containing glycosylation sites were generated using standard overlapping PCR methodology, with the introduced sequences indicated in Fig. 4A. The N-terminal extension containing a glycosylation site was generated using standard PCR with the forward primer encoding the extension. The amino acid sequence of this extension (MTAGNGTGSASAGHASPGAT) was the same as a portion of the loop 6 extension. The loop extension and N-terminal extension PCR products were cloned into the pcDNA3.1D/V5-His vector (Invitrogen) without a stop codon to allow expression of the V5/His tag. All primer sequences are available upon request.Fig. 4Loops 2, 4, and 6 of APH-1 are extracytosolic.A, a diagram of APH-1 shows the positions and sequences of the inserted loop extensions. Glycosylation motifs (NGT) are shown in boldface type. B, HEK293T cells were transfected with each of the six glycosylation extended-loop (GX-L) mutants or with wt APH-1. Numbering of the GX-L mutants refers to the hydrophilic loop containing the extension and glycosylation motif. For example, GX-L1 refers to the mutant containing a loop extension inserted after residue 29 in the APH-1 sequence. All constructs had C-terminal V5 tags. Control cells were transfected with GFP. Cells were lysed in RIPA buffer and analyzed by Western blotting for the V5 tag. Placement of the glycosylation motif into loops 2, 4, or 6 caused an upward mobility shift. The solid circle indicates the position of the upper CTF as described later in the text, and the bracket indicates the positions of upper CTFs that have shifted upward due to inclusion of a loop extension with (GX-L4 and GX-L6) or without (GX-L5) an additional shift due to glycosylation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Antibodies—V5-tagged APH-1 was detected with anti-V5 monoclonal antibody (mAb) (Invitrogen) on Western blots. Rabbit anti-V5 polyclonal antibody (pAb) (Sigma) was used for immunofluorescence detection. Immunoprecipitations were performed using a rabbit anti-V5 antisera produced at Cocalico (Reamstown, PA) by immunizing rabbits with a thioredoxin/V5 fusion protein. APP-KK was detected with the goat pAb Karen. HA-tagged proteins were detected with HA.11 mAb (Covance, Princeton, NJ) for Western blots and were immunoprecipitated with HA.11 pAb (Covance). Immunofluorescence Microscopy—HeLa cells were plated at ∼30% confluency on glass coverslips in 24-well plates and transfected the following day with APP-KK plus APH-1-V5 (1 μg of DNA of each plasmid per well) using the GenePorter transfection reagent (Gene Therapy Systems, Inc., San Diego, CA). Some samples were treated with activated streptolysin O (SLO; 200 units/ml) for 5 min at 37 °C prior to fixation to permeabilize selectively the plasma membrane. All samples were then fixed in 2% formaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature. Some samples were fully permeabilized after fixation by treatment with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min at room temperature. APP-KK was detected with Karen pAb (1:500), and APH-1-V5 was detected with anti-V5 pAb (1:500). All antibodies were diluted in PBS containing 4% fetal bovine serum. Secondary antibodies used were donkey anti-goat AlexaFluor 488 and donkey anti-rabbit AlexaFluor 594 (each at 1:500; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). 4′,6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride (1:1000) was included with all secondary antibodies to stain nuclei. Coverslips were mounted using Fluoromount-G (Southern Biotechnology Associates, Inc., Birmingham, AL). Cells were imaged with a ×100 objective lens on a Nikon E600 epifluorescence microscope. Glycosylation Assays—HEK293T cells were plated at ∼50% confluency in 6-well plates and transfected the following day with APH-1 or Pen-2 plasmids (2 μg of DNA per well) using the GenePorter transfection reagent. Control cells were transfected with a green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression plasmid. Cells were lysed ∼24 h post-transfection in radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 5 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 8) with Complete protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science) after washing in PBS. Lysates were sonicated and centrifuged (10,000 × g, 10 min, 4 °C) to remove insoluble material and then denatured in sample preparation buffer (2% SDS, 50 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 10% glycerol) at 55 °C for 15 min. For some experiments, the lysates were divided into 3 aliquots and treated with peptide N-glycosidase F (PNGase F) or endoglycosidase H (Endo H) (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA), as described in the manufacturer's instructions, or with PBS as a control. Digestions were carried out at 37 °C for 3 h, followed by denaturation in sample preparation buffer. Lysates were electrophoresed on 10–20% polyacrylamide Tris-HCl gels (Bio-Rad), transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and then probed with the appropriate primary antibodies and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. Blots were imaged with ECL-Plus Western blotting detection system (Amersham Biosciences) or SuperSignal West Femto maximum sensitivity substrate (Pierce) on a Fujifilm (Stamford, CT) LAS-1000 camera. Co-immunoprecipitations—HEK293T cells in 6-well plates were transfected with APH-1-V5 plasmids plus or minus Nct-HA plasmids (1.5 μg of each plasmid per well) using GenePorter. For all co-transfection experiments, total DNA transfected per well was equalized by adding 1.5 μg of an irrelevant expression vector (DC-SIGN in pcDNA3.1) to the samples in which Nct was omitted. Cells were lysed ∼24 h post-transfection with CHAPSO buffer (1% CHAPSO (Sigma), 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA with Complete protease inhibitors). Lysates were incubated for 30 min at 4 °C with rotation to allow complete lysis and then centrifuged (10,000 × g, 5 min, 4 °C) to remove insoluble material. Lysates were pre-cleared with protein A/G-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) plus normal rabbit serum (NRS). Cleared lysates were divided into aliquots for immunoprecipitation at 4 °C for 3 h with HA.11 pAb, anti-V5 pAb, or NRS pre-bound to protein A/G-agarose beads and then washed three times in CHAPSO buffer after immunoprecipitation. For samples being processed for APH-1 detection, the proteins were eluted from the beads with immunoprecipitation elution buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 4 m urea, 10% glycerol) at 55 °C for 15 min. For samples being processed for Nct detection, the proteins were eluted with sample preparation buffer plus 2% β-mercaptoethanol at 100 °C for 10 min. For immuno-precipitation followed by PNGase F treatment, the proteins were first eluted with 1% SDS, 50 mm Tris, pH 6.8, for 15 min at 55 °C, then treated with PNGase F after adding the appropriate buffers for 3 h at 37 °C, and then denatured in immunoprecipitation elution buffer at 55 °C for 15 min. Samples were electrophoresed and detected as described above for the glycosylation assays. Cycloheximide Treatment—HEK293T cells were transfected with APH-1-V5 plus or minus Nct-HA, with the total DNA added per well equalized as described above. Cells were treated with 150 μg/ml cycloheximide (CHX; Sigma) in cell culture medium, then washed and lysed at various time points in RIPA buffer, and prepared for Western blot analysis as described above. The C-terminal Domain of APH-1 Faces the Cytosol—APH-1 contains seven hydrophobic regions that are of sufficient length to span the lipid bilayer (Fig. 1A), giving rise to a model in which APH-1 traverses the membrane seven times. However, it is unclear whether all of these regions are in fact utilized as TM domains, nor is it known on which side of the membrane the N and C termini of the protein reside. To determine whether the C terminus of APH-1 lies on the cytosolic or luminal side of the ER membrane, we added a C-terminal V5 epitope tag to APH-1aS (the short splice variant of APH-1a), expressed the construct in HeLa cells, and visualized the epitope tag by immunofluorescence microscopy under various permeabilization conditions (Fig. 2). As a control, the cells were co-transfected with an APP construct containing a di-lysine ER retention motif (APP-KK). APP-KK was detected with an antisera that binds to epitopes within the APP ectodomain. In non-permeabilized cells, neither the APP ectodomain nor the APH-1 C-terminal tag was detectable (Fig. 2, upper panels). When the cells were treated with SLO to permeabilize selectively the plasma membrane, the APP ectodomain was not detected, indicating that the ER membrane remained intact, but the C-terminal tag of APH-1 was clearly visible (Fig. 2, middle panels). When all cellular membranes were permeabilized with Triton X-100, both APP and APH-1 were detected in a pattern characteristic of ER localization (Fig. 2, lower panels). These results indicate that the C terminus of APH-1 resides within the cytosol. Unfortunately, a variety of epitope tags placed on the N terminus of APH-1 were not detectable by immunofluorescence under any conditions, so we were unable to determine the location of the N terminus with this technique. Glycosylation Site Insertion Mutagenesis—To identify regions of APH-1 that lie within the ER lumen, we used site-directed mutagenesis to introduce the N-linked glycosylation sequon NX(S/T) into regions of APH-1 that are predicted to reside outside of the lipid bilayer (Fig. 1B). Because N-linked glycosylation occurs only within the lumen of the ER (30Kornfeld R. Kornfeld S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 631-664Google Scholar), proteins containing this motif will be glycosylated only if the sequon is contained within a luminally exposed region of the protein. This method of glycosylation-scanning mutagenesis has been used to probe the topology of other membrane proteins, including Pen-2 (22Crystal A.S. Morais V.A. Pierson T.C. Pijak D.S. Carlin D. Lee V.M.Y. Doms R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20117-20123Google Scholar, 31Chang X.B. Hou Y.X. Jensen T.J. Riordan J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18572-18575Google Scholar, 32Hamilton S.R. Yao S.Y. Ingram J.C. Hadden D.A. Ritzel M.W. Gallagher M.P. Henderson P.J. Cass C.E. Young J.D. Baldwin S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27981-27988Google Scholar, 33Vannier B. Zhu X. Brown D. Birnbaumer L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8675-8679Google Scholar). As a control for the assay, we expressed a previously characterized Pen-2 S93N mutant containing a glycosylation site within its luminal C-terminal domain (22Crystal A.S. Morais V.A. Pierson T.C. Pijak D.S. Carlin D. Lee V.M.Y. Doms R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20117-20123Google Scholar). This protein became glycosylated and showed the expected ∼4-kDa mobility shift above wild-type (wt) Pen-2 (Fig. 3). However, none of the seven APH-1 mutants exhibited mobility shifts characteristic of glycosylation (Fig. 3). Because N-linked glycosylation may be inefficient when the NX(S/T) motif is in close proximity to adjacent membrane domains and because most of the predicted hydrophilic loops of APH-1 are short, we next constructed “glycosylation extended-loop” (GX-L) mutants of APH-1, in which each of the six hydro-philic loop regions was extended to a length of at least 30 amino acids with an NGT sequon in the middle (Fig. 4A). Because loops 2 and 4 are each ∼15 residues long, GX-L2 and GX-L4 were created by doubling the loop sequence and placing the NGT sequon between the two repeats. The extensions on the other loops (GX-L1, GX-L3, GX-L5, and GX-L6) were created using random hydrophilic amino acids as spacers with NGT in the middle. When these GX-L mutants were expressed in cells and analyzed by Western blotting, GX-L2, GX-L4, and GX-L6 showed ∼4–5-kDa shifts upward, whereas GX-L3 and GX-L5 did not (Fig. 4B). As expected, the mobilities of all of the mutants were somewhat shifted compared with wt APH-1 because of the added mass of the loop extensions themselves, each of which are ∼1–2 kDa. GX-L1 was apparently an unstable mutant as it was detected poorly. To determine whether the observed mobility shifts were due to glycosylation, we treated cell lysates with PNGase F, which removes all N-linked carbohydrate structures. We found that PNGase F treatment caused a downward mobility shift in GX-L2, GX-L4, and GX-L6 but did not alter the mobilities of wt APH-1, GX-L3, or GX-L5 (Fig. 5A). These results confirm that loops 2, 4, and 6 were glycosylated and therefore within the lumen of the ER, whereas loops 3 and 5 were not. The addition of hydrophilic loop extensions could alter the topology of APH-1. For example, a significant length of additional hydrophilic residues could prevent a portion of the protein that would normally be luminal from transferring across the ER membrane. If this were the case, the remainder of the protein C-terminal to the extension might adopt a topology opposite of its normal orientation. To assess whether the topology of any of our GX-L mutants had been reversed, we used the V5 epitope tag at the C terminus of each of the GX-L constructs and performed immunofluorescence microscopy with selective membrane permeabilization as in Fig. 2. In each case, the C-terminal tag was detectable within the cytosol after selective plasma membrane permeabilization with SLO, similar to the wild-type protein, whereas the ectodomain of the control protein (APP-KK) was not (data not shown). We also assessed whether each of the mutants was able to associate with Nct in co-immunoprecipitation experiments. Each of the GX-L mutants (except for the poorly expressed GX-L1) was expressed in HEK293T cells along with Nct-HA, followed by immunoprecipitation of APH-1 (wt or GX-L mutants) and detection of coimmunoprecipitated Nct on Western blots with an anti-HA epitope tag antibody. Each of the APH-1 constructs interacted with Nct as judged by this co-imm"

We previously used a series of probes incorporating photolabile residues into positions 6, 12, 13, 14, 18, 22, and 26 of the 27-residue peptide and demonstrated that each covalently labeled a site within the receptor amino terminus. Although supporting a critical role of this domain for ligand binding, it does not explain the molecular mechanism of receptor activation. Here, we developed probes having photolabile residues at the amino terminus of secretin to explore possible approximations with a different receptor domain. The first probe incorporated a photolabile p-benzoyl-l-phenylalanine into the position of His1 of rat secretin ([Bpa1,Tyr10]secretin-27). Because His1 is critical for function, we also positioned a photolabile Bpa as an amino-terminal extension, in positions -1 (rat [Bpa-1,Tyr10]secretin-27) and -2 (rat [Bpa-2,Gly-1,Tyr10]secretin-27). Each analog was shown to be a full agonist, stimulating cAMP accumulation in receptor-bearing Chinese hamster ovary-SecR cells in a concentration-dependent manner, with the position -2 probe being most potent. They bound specifically and saturably, although the position 1 analog had lowest affinity, and all were able to label the receptor efficiently. Sequential specific cleavage, purification, and sequencing demonstrated that the sites of covalent attachment for each probe were high within the sixth transmembrane segment. This suggests that secretin binding may exert tension between the receptor amino terminus and the transmembrane domain to elicit a conformational change effecting receptor activation.

This suggests that secretin binding may exert tension between the receptor amino terminus and the transmembrane domain to elicit a conformational change effecting receptor activation. The secretin receptor is prototypic of the Class B family of guanine nucleotide-binding protein (G protein)-coupled receptors which includes many important drug targets. Understanding of the molecular basis of ligand binding of receptors is important for the rational design of receptor-active drugs. However, the molecular basis of ligand binding of Class B receptors is less well understood than that of members of the Class A family, such as rhodopsin and the adrenergic receptor. This likely reflects the facts that natural ligands for Class B G protein-coupled receptors are relatively large peptides with diffuse phamacophoric domains and that these receptors have long and complex amino-terminal domains that are important for binding. Both of these interacting domains are flexible, with active conformations that have not been clearly defined. One of the distinct characteristics of the Class B receptor family is the long amino terminus that exceeds 120 residues in length. It contains 6 conserved Cys residues that have been demonstrated to form intradomain disulfide bonds (1.Qi L.J. Leung A.T. Xiong Y. Marx K.A. Abou-Samra A.B.

It should be noted that the pattern of disulfide bonds obtained from the refolded amino-terminal extracellular domain of the corticotropin-releasing factor is different from that predicted by mutagenesis of that entire receptor (1.Qi L.J. Leung A.T. Xiong Y. Marx K.A. Abou-Samra A.B. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12442-12448Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Like that of other members of the Class B family, the complex amino terminus of the secretin receptor has been demonstrated to play a critical role in ligand binding by mutagenesis and chimeric receptor analysis (6.Holtmann M.H.

We have taken a more direct approach to understanding the molecular basis of secretin binding to its receptor, utilizing intrinsic photoaffinity labeling. This approach can provide information regarding spatial approximations between photolabile residues situated within a ligand and residues adjacent to these when docked at the receptor. We have used a series of probes with a photolabile residue (p-benzoyl-l-phenylalanine (Bpa) or p-benzoylbenzoyl-l-lysine (BzBz)Lys)) in different regions of the peptide, in positions 6, 12, 13, 14, 18, 22, and 26 (8.Dong M.

This strongly supports a critical role for the amino terminus of the secretin receptor in ligand binding. However, mutagenesis data have shown that, in addition to the amino-terminal region of the secretin receptor, the extracellular loop regions play complementary roles that affect ligand binding. It is not known whether such effects are direct, interacting with the ligand, or indirect, interacting with other portions of the receptor itself. Because the distal amino-terminal region of secretin has been shown to be functionally important and has not yet been studied directly by photoaffinity labeling, in the current work we focused on this region as a possible site of interaction with the body of the receptor. The amino terminus of PTH, the natural ligand of another Class B G protein-coupled receptor, has been shown to interact with the top of the sixth transmembrane segment (TM6) of that receptor (14.Bisello A.

Bitan G. Rosenblatt M. Chorev M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9-17Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). However, incorporation of a photolabile residue at the amino terminus of secretin may be challenging because of the critical importance of His1 in structure-activity studies (16.Hefford M.A. Kaplan H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 998: 267-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Therefore, in addition to replacing His1 with a photolabile Bpa (rat [Bpa1,Tyr10]secretin-27), we also placed a Bpa at the amino-terminal extension of secretin, in positions -1 (rat [Bpa-1,Tyr10]secretin-27) and -2 (rat [Bpa-2,Gly-1,Tyr10]secretin-27), to minimize possible negative functional impact. In this work, we have successfully synthesized three photolabile analogs and have shown that they are full agonists that bind to the secretin receptor specifically and saturably and that they are able to label this receptor efficiently. All three probes consistently labeled receptor residues in a distinct region that included the top of the secretin receptor TM6. Together with other photoaffinity labeling data we reported previously, these constraints were built into a three-dimensional model of the agonist-bound secretin receptor. These findings add important constraints to the docking of secretin to its receptor and may suggest a mechanism for ligand binding and activation which may be shared by other members of the Class B family of G protein-coupled receptors. Materials—Cyanogen bromide (CNBr), solid phase oxidant, N-chloro-benzenesulfonamide (IODO-BEADS), m-maleimidobenzoyl-N-hydroxysulfosuccinimide ester (Sulfo-MBS), and acetic anhydride were purchased from Pierce. Endoproteinase Lys-C was from Calbiochem. 3-Isobutyl-1-methylxanthine and N-(2-aminoethyl-1)-3-aminopropyl glass beads were from Sigma. Endoglycosidase F was produced in our laboratory (17.Pearson R.K. Miller L.J. Hadac E.M. Powers S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 13850-13856Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All other reagents were analytical grade. Peptides—The probes, rat [Bpa1,Tyr10]secretin-27 (Bpa1 probe), rat [Bpa-1,Tyr10]secretin-27 (Bpa-1 probe), and rat [Bpa-2,Gly-1,Tyr10]secretin-27 (Bpa-2 probe), were designed to contain a Tyr residue at position 10 for radioiodination and a photolabile residue, Bpa, in positions near the amino terminus, for covalent labeling of the secretin receptor. These three probes and other peptides used in this study, i.e. rat secretin-27 and the peptide used for radiolabeling, rat [Tyr10]secretin-27, were synthesized by manual solid phase techniques and purified to homogeneity by reversed-phase HPLC, as described previously (18.Powers S.P. Pinon D.I. Miller L.J. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1988; 31: 429-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Their chemical identities were established by mass spectrometry. The above three photolabile probes and the radioligand used in receptor binding studies were radioiodinated oxidatively with Na 125I upon exposure to an IODO-BEAD for 15 s and purified by reversed-phase HPLC to yield specific radioactivities of 2,000 Ci/mmol (18.Powers S.P. Pinon D.I. Miller L.J. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1988; 31: 429-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Receptor Preparations—Secretin receptor-bearing Chinese hamster ovary cell line (CHO-SecR), which has been previously established and characterized (19.Ulrich C.D. Pinon D.I. Hadac E.M. Holicky E.L. Chang-Miller A. Gates L.K. Miller L.J. Gastroenterology. 1993; 105: 1534-1543Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), was used as source of wild type receptors for the current study. In this work, it was necessary to develop new secretin receptor mutants that incorporated additional sites for CNBr cleavage in the first extracellular loop (ECL1) and TM6. These represented Ala175 to Met (A175M), Leu324 to Met (L324M), Ile331 to Met (I331M), and Ile334 to Met (I334M) receptor constructs. In addition, two dual mutants were developed to introduce a new CNBr cleavage site while simultaneously eliminating a naturally occurring Met residue, one representing Ile331 to Met, Met344 to Ile (I331M/M344I), with another one representing Ile334 to Met, Met344 to Ile (I334M/M344I). These mutants were prepared using an oligonucleotide-directed approach with the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene, with the products verified by direct DNA sequencing (20.Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52769) Google Scholar). A CHO cell line stably expressing the I334M/M344I construct was produced using the same methodology utilized previously (21.Hadac E.M. Ghanekar D.V. Holicky E.L. Pinon D.I. Dougherty R.W. Miller L.J. Pancreas. 1996; 13: 130-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). This cell line and the CHO-SecR line were cultured at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 environment on Falcon tissue culture plastic ware in Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 5% fetal clone-2 (Hyclone Laboratories, Logan, UT). Cells were passaged twice a week and lifted mechanically before use. The A175M, L324M, I331M, I334M, and I331M/M344I mutant receptor constructs were expressed transiently on COS cells (American Type Cell Collection, Manassas, VA) after transfection using a modification of the DEAE-dextran method (7.Holtmann M.H. Ganguli S. Hadac E.M. Dolu V. Miller L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14944-14949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). These cells were harvested mechanically 72 h after transfection. Receptor-enriched plasma membranes were prepared from these cell lines using methods that we reported previously (21.Hadac E.M. Ghanekar D.V. Holicky E.L. Pinon D.I. Dougherty R.W. Miller L.J. Pancreas. 1996; 13: 130-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Biological Activity Assay—The agonist activities of the Bpa1, Bpa-1, and Bpa-2 probes were studied for stimulation of cAMP activity in the CHO-SecR cells using a competitive binding assay (Diagnostic Products Corporation, Los Angeles, CA). Cells were stimulated with the secretin analogs at 37 °C for 30 min, and the reaction was stopped by adding ice-cold perchloric acid. After adjusting the pH to 6 with KHCO3, cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 3,000 rpm for 10 min, and the supernatants were used in the assay, as described previously (22.Ganguli S.C. Park C.G. Holtmann M.H. Hadac E.M. Kenakin T.P. Miller L.J. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1998; 286: 593-598PubMed Google Scholar). Radioactivity was quantified by scintillation counting in a Beckman LS6000. This assay was also used to characterize functionally the new receptor mutants expressed transiently in COS cells. Ligand Binding—Binding to the secretin receptor was characterized in a standard assay using membranes from the CHO-SecR cell line as source of receptor. Membranes (5 μg) were incubated with a constant amount of radioligand, rat 125I-[Tyr10]secretin-27 (5 pm), in the presence of increasing concentrations of rat [Bpa1,Tyr10]secretin-27, rat [Bpa-1,Tyr10]secretin-27, or rat [Bpa-2,Gly-1,Tyr10]secretin-27 (0–1 μm) for 1 h at room temperature in Krebs-Ringer-HEPES (KRH) medium (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 104 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm KH2PO4, 1.2 mm MgSO4,2mm CaCl2,1mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.01% soybean trypsin inhibitor) containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin. Bound and free radioligand were separated using a Skatron cell harvester (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) with glass fiber filtermats that had been soaked in 0.3% Polybrene for 1 h, and bound radioactivity was quantified in a γ-spectrometer. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 1 μm secretin and represented <20% of total binding. The same assay was also utilized to characterize the binding activity of the new receptor mutants transiently expressed in COS cells. Photoaffinity Labeling of the Secretin Receptor—For covalent labeling studies, membranes from receptor-bearing CHO cells containing ∼50 μg of protein were incubated with 0.1 nm rat 125I-[Bpa1,Tyr10]secretin-27 or rat 125I-[Bpa-1,Tyr10]secretin-27 or rat 125I-[Bpa-2,Gly-1,Tyr10]secretin-27 in the presence of increasing concentrations of secretin (0–1 μm)for1hat room temperature prior to photolysis for 30 min at 4 °C in a Rayonet photochemical reactor (Southern New England Ultraviolet, Hamden, CT) equipped with 3,500-Å lamps. To scale up receptor for purification, a larger amount of membranes (150–200 μg) was incubated with 0.5 nm rat 125I-[Bpa1,Tyr10]secretin-27 or rat 125I-[Bpa-1,Tyr10]secretin-27 or rat 125I-[Bpa-2,Gly-1,Tyr10]secretin-27 in the absence of competing secretin. After photolysis, membranes were washed, pelleted, solubilized in SDS sample buffer, and applied to a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel for electrophoresis (23.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Radiolabeled bands were detected by autoradiography. Identification of the Labeled Receptor Domains—Radioactive receptor bands were cut out from the gel and homogenized in water in a Dounce homogenizer, followed by elution, lyophilization, and ethanol precipitation. This material was used for chemical or enzymatic cleavage experiments. Aliquots of affinity labeled secretin receptor were deglycosylated with endoglycosidase F, as described previously (21.Hadac E.M. Ghanekar D.V. Holicky E.L. Pinon D.I. Dougherty R.W. Miller L.J. Pancreas. 1996; 13: 130-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). CNBr and endoproteinase Lys-C were used separately or in sequence to cleave the labeled secretin receptor or its mutants using procedures described previously (8.Dong M. Wang Y. Pinon D.I. Hadac E.M. Miller L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 903-909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The products of cleavage were resolved on 10% NuPAGE gels using MES running buffer (Invitrogen). After electrophoresis, labeled bands were identified by exposure to x-ray film with intensifying screens at -80 °C. In addition to peptide mapping by chemical and enzymatic cleavage, as described above, identification of the secretin receptor fragments affinity-labeled with the Bpa-1 and Bpa-2 probes was also achieved by Edman degradation sequencing of the purified CNBr fragments of the labeled receptor. For this, plasma membranes (10 mg) were photoaffinity labeled with 0.1 μm rat [Bpa-1,Tyr10]secretin-27 or rat [Bpa-2,Gly-1,Tyr10] secretin-27. These materials were mixed with 1-mg plasma membranes labeled with 1 nm rat 125I-[Bpa-1,Tyr10] secretin-27 or rat 125I-[Bpa-2,Gly-1,Tyr10] secretin-27 and were gel purified by the procedure described above. Labeled receptors were cleaved by CNBr and the resulting fragments were purified by gel electrophoresis followed by elution, lyophilization, and acetone precipitation. Purified fragments were then injected onto a PerkinElmer Life Sciences/Brownlee microbore C-18 HPLC column, utilizing a flow rate of 5 μl/min and 10 min of 1% solution B, followed by a linear gradient up to 80% solution B over 190 min (A, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and B, 0.085% trifluoroacetic acid and acetonitrile). The separation was monitored at 280 nm with a UV absorbance detector. The eluant from this microbore column was collected directly onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane strip that was subsequently exposed to x-ray film for detection of the position of the radioactive peak. The peak area was excised from the membrane and subjected to Edman degradation sequencing using an Applied Biosystems automated instrument. Identification of Labeled Receptor Residues—Considering that the photolabile residue Bpa was located in the first position of the secretin analogs used in this study, caution was required to prevent cleavage of the Bpa in the first cycle of radiochemical Edman degradation sequencing of the attached receptor fragment. This was achieved by acetylation of the free amino group of the photolabile probe using acetic anhydride after photoaffinity labeling of the receptor, but prior to CNBr cleavage. For this, gel-purified and ethanol-precipitated labeled secretin receptor was dissolved in 200 μl of 0.1 m phosphate buffer (pH 7.8) containing 0.1% SDS. 20 μl of acetic anhydride was added in 5-μl aliquots over the course of 1 h, and the reaction was incubated for an additional hour with stirring at room temperature in the dark. Acetylated materials were ethanol precipitated prior to CNBr cleavage. After gel purification, the CNBr fragment was used for Edman degradation to localize the receptor residues labeled by these probes. Radiochemical sequencing was performed on cysteine-containing CNBr fragments of the receptor which were immobilized through sulfhydryl groups using the bifunctional cross-linker, Sulfo-MBS, and N-(2-aminoethyl-1)-3-aminopropyl glass beads. Edman degradation was manually repeated in a manner that has been reported previously in detail (24.Ji Z. Hadac E.M. Henne R.M. Patel S.A. Lybrand T.P. Miller L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24393-24401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 25.Hadac E.M. Pinon D.I. Ji Z. Holicky E.L. Henne R.M. Lybrand T.P. Miller L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12988-12993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), and the radioactivity released in each cycle was quantified in a γ-spectrometer. Statistical Analysis—All observations were repeated at least three times in independent experiments and are expressed as the means ± S.E. Binding curves were analyzed and plotted using the nonlinear regression analysis routine for radioligand binding in the Prism software package (GraphPad Software, San Diego). Binding kinetics was determined by analysis with the LIGAND program of Munson and Rodbard (26.Munson P.J. Rodbard D. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 107: 220-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (7772) Google Scholar). Molecular Modeling—Homology modeling techniques were employed to model both the receptor amino-terminal region and transmembrane region. The two regions were then connected guided by experimental data reported previously (27.Pellegrini M. Bisello A. Rosenblatt M. Chorev M. Mierke D.F. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 12737-12743Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). A detailed description of the receptor modeling has been reported elsewhere (13.Dong M. Li Z. Zang M. Pinon D.I. Lybrand T.P. Miller L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48300-48312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Here we give a brief summary. For modeling of the amino-terminal region, sequence data bases were searched for homologs of each of the closely related Class B family amino-terminal domains using FASTA3 (28.Pearson W.R. Lipman D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2444-2448Crossref PubMed Scopus (9393) Google Scholar). Homologs with experimentally determined three-dimensional structures were assessed for suitability as templates in a homology modeling exercise, using structure-based sequence alignment of the secretin receptor amino terminus incorporated in MOE (29.Chemical Computing Group, Inc.MOE 2001.01. Chemical Computing Group, Inc., Montreal, Canada1997–2001Google Scholar). Three-dimensional homology models for the rat secretin receptor amino terminus were then built using Modeler (30.Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10636) Google Scholar). Final models were assessed for stereochemical quality and side chain packing profiles using the PROCHECK (31.Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar) and QPACK programs (32.Gregoret L.M. Cohen F.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 211: 959-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The first eight residues of the amino-terminal region were then built into the homology model as an extended conformation, and the rest of carboxyl-terminal residues (109–122) were modeled as two α-helices approximately perpendicular to each other as suggested by experimental data (27.Pellegrini M. Bisello A. Rosenblatt M. Chorev M. Mierke D.F. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 12737-12743Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). To model the receptor transmembrane domain, the transmembrane helix sequences of the rat secretin receptor were aligned with those of bovine rhodopsin (PDB code: 1F88) based on the previously reported alignment derived using the “cold spot” method (33.Frimurer T.M. Bywater R.P. Proteins. 1999; 35: 375-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). A homology model for the transmembrane domain was built using Sybyl 6.9 (34.Tripos Inc Sybyl 6.9. Tripos, Inc., St. Louis, MO2003Google Scholar). Extracellular and cytosolic loops were built by first defining anchoring residues located at each helix terminus, then searching a data base of protein loops for a proper template to model them. The last carboxyl-terminal helix of the amino-terminal domain model described above was treated as the beginning of transmembrane helix 1, these fragments were superimposed, and the two domains connected to create an intact secretin receptor model. The NMR-derived solution structure of secretin (35.Clore G.M. Nilges M. Brunger A. Gronenborn A.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 171: 479-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) was manually docked close to its putative binding site in the three-dimensional model, guided by our previous photoaffinity labeling data (8.Dong M.

https://openalex.org/W2070476685,"Modification by ubiquitin plays a major role in a broad array of cellular functions. Although reversal of this process, deubiquitination, likely represents an important regulatory step contributing to cellular homeostasis, functions of deubiquitination enzymes still remain poorly characterized. We have previously shown that the ubiquitin protease Ubp3p requires a co-factor, Bre5p, to specifically deubiquitinate the coat protein complex II (COPII) subunit Sec23p, which is involved in anterograde transport between endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi compartiments. In the present report, we show that disruption of BRE5 gene also led to a defect in the retrograde transport from the Golgi to the endoplasmic reticulum. Further analysis indicate that the COPI subunit β′-COP represents another substrate of the Ubp3p·Bre5p complex. All together, our results indicate that the Ubp3p·Bre5p deubiquitination complex co-regulates anterograde and retrograde transports between endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi compartments.

Modification of target proteins by ubiquitin participates in a wide array of biological functions. Proteins destined for degradation or processing via the 26 S proteasome are coupled to multiple copies of ubiquitin. However, attachment of ubiquitin or ubiquitin-related molecules may also result in changes in subcellular distribution or modification of protein activity (1Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6958) Google Scholar, 2Glickman M.H. Ciechanover A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 373-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (3378) Google Scholar). Understanding of mechanisms and regulation of ubiquitin conjugation considerably improved over the past 10 years and recent studies indicate that reversal of this modification, namely deubiquitination, represents an additional level of regulation. The deubiquitination process is catalyzed by proteases called deubiquitinating enzymes, which fall into four distinct families (3Kim J.H. Park K.C. Chung S.S. Bang O. Chung C.H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2003; 134: 9-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolases, ubiquitin-specific processing proteases (USPs or UBPs), 1The abbreviations used are: USPs (or UBPs)ubiquitin-specific processing proteasesERendoplasmic reticulumNTF2nuclear transport factor 2GSTglutathione S-transferaseGAPGTPase-activating proteinCOPcoat protein complex. OTU-domain ubiquitin-aldehyde-binding proteins, and Jab1/Pad1/MPN-domain-containing metallo-enzymes. Among these four families, UBPs represent the most widespread and represented deubiquitinating enzymes across evolution. In particular, the Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome encodes for 16 UBPs and only one UCH, but none of these enzymes is essential for yeast viability. UBPs tend to release ubiquitin from a conjugated protein. They display similar catalytic domains containing conserved Cys and His boxes but divergent N-terminal and occasionally C-terminal extensions (4Chung C.H. Baek S.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 266: 633-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 5Wilkinson K.D. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 11: 141-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar), which are thought to function in substrate recognition, subcellular localization, and protein-protein interactions. The molecular basis for substrate recognition by UBP has been described poorly. Indeed human HAUSP has been shown to be necessary and sufficient to deubiquitinate its specific substrate, the p53 tumor suppressor (6Li M. Chen D. Shiloh A. Luo J. Nikolaev A.Y. Qin J. Gu W. Nature. 2002; 416: 648-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar), but no additional substrate for this Ubp has been identified so far. The tumor suppressor CYLD has been shown to negatively regulate NF-κB signaling by deubiquitinating NEMO and TRAF2 (7Trompouki E. Hatzivassiliou E. Tsichritzis T. Farmer H. Ashworth A. Mosialos G.

We recently reported that the yeast Ubp3p forms a complex with Bre5p, which specifically deubiquitinates Sec23p, a component of the COPII complex essential for anterograde transport between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the Golgi apparatus (10Cohen M. Stutz F. Belgareh N. Haguenauer-Tsapis R. Dargemont C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 661-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Ubp3p is the only yeast Ubp able to catalyze Sec23p deubiquitination indicating that Ubps can exert their activity on specific substrates and are probably not redundant. Ubp3p directly interacts with Sec23p, and its catalytic cysteine residue is essential for the deubiquitinating activity. In contrast Bre5p does not participate to Sec23p recognition nor complements a catalytically inactive Ubp3p but rather acts as an essential positive regulator of Ubp3p. Bre5p displays an N-terminal domain related to the nuclear transport factor 2 (NTF2) and responsible for the interaction with Ubp3p and and a C-terminal domain presenting putative RNA-binding sites. Mammalian cells display two proteins homologous to Bre5p, G3BP1 and G3BP2. Interestingly, G3BP1 has been shown to interact with USP10 (11Soncini C. Berdo I. Draetta G. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 3869-3879Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), a human ubiquitin protease sharing 46% similarity and 27% identity with Ubp3p. The interaction between USP10 and G3BP1 suggests that the Ubp3p·Bre5p complex might have been conserved during evolution. However, there is no clue whether these yeast and human complexes are implicated in similar functions. In the present report, we analyzed whether the yeast Ubp3p·Bre5p complex could have other substrates than Sec23p and whether the human USP10·G3BP1 complex could recognize these substrates.

Demarini D.J. Shah N.G. Wach A. Brachat A. Philippsen P. Pringle J.R. Yeast. 1998; 14: 953-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (4193) Google Scholar). Rabbit polyclonal antibodies to yeast Gcs1p (1:1000 dilution) and Glo3p (1:1000) were kindly provided by G. Johnston, α-COP (1:800), β′-COP (1:200), and δ-COP (1:500) by F. Letourneur and antibodies to β-COP#9381 (1:600), β′-COP#9562 (1:1000), γ-COP (1: 1000), and ϵ-COP (1:800) were generous gifts from R. Duden. ER Retrieval Defect Assay of Dilysine-tagged Ste2p—The in vivo assay to monitor ER retrieval of dilysine-tagged Ste2p in yeast was performed essentially as described previously (13Letourneur F. Gaynor E.C. Hennecke S. Demolliere C. Duden R. Emr S.D. Riezman H. Cosson P. Cell. 1994; 79: 1199-1207Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar). Briefly, MATa cells (WT, ret1.1, and bre5Δ) deleted of the endogenous STE2 gene and expressing the Ste2-WBP1 fusion protein, were mated with MATα cells (RH311-3D). Resulting diploids were selected on growth medium lacking uracil and histidine. Yeast Extracts and GST Pull-down Assay—Cells grown in yeast/peptone/dextrose were collected during the exponential growth phase (A600 = 2). Total protein extracts were prepared by the NaOH-trichloroacetic acid lysis method (14Avaro S. Belgareh-Touze N. Sibella-Arguelles C. Volland C. Haguenauer-Tsapis R. Yeast. 2002; 19: 351-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Alternatively cells were lysed at 4 °C with glass beads in IP buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0,5% Triton, 10% glycerol, supplemented with a mixture of protease inhibitors, 10 μg/ml aprotinine, pepstatine, leupeptine, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The resulting lysate was centrifuged for 30 min at 13,000 × g. 3 μg of GST-WBP1 or GST-WBP1-SS fusion proteins expressed from plasmids generously provided by F. Letourneur were incubated with lysates of BRE5 or bre5Δ cells for 1 h at 4 °C and an additional hour at 4 °C in the presence of glutathione-Sepharose beads. Beads were washed in IP buffer and heated in sample buffer before SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Two-hybrid Assay—A bait fusion protein between USP10 and the LexA DNA binding domain was expressed from the pBTM116 plasmid (11Soncini C. Berdo I. Draetta G. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 3869-3879Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). COPI bovine subunits fused to the Gal4 activation domain were expressed from the pAD-Gal4–2.1 and pACTII plasmids (15Faulstich D. Auerbach S. Orci L. Ravazzola M. Wegchingel S. Lottspeich F. Stenbeck G. Harter C. Wieland F.T. Tschochner H. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 53-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The two-hybrid assay was performed as described previously (10Cohen M. Stutz F. Belgareh N. Haguenauer-Tsapis R. Dargemont C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 661-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). BRE5 Genetically Interacts with the GLO3 Gene—Screening for mutations that induce synthetic lethality upon disruption of the BRE5 gene recently led to the identification of a genetic interaction between BRE5 and SFB3, a gene encoding for a Sec24-like component of the COPII complex. Indeed Bre5p forms a complex with the ubiquitin protease Ubp3p that deubiquitinates the COPII protein Sec23p (10Cohen M. Stutz F. Belgareh N. Haguenauer-Tsapis R. Dargemont C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 661-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). To identify additional substrates of the Ubp3p·Bre5p complex, we characterized another mutant strain from this screen and found that the viability of these cells could be rescued by the GLO3 gene (Fig. 1A). Both BRE5 and a truncated version of BRE5 encoding a protein deleted of its RNA-binding domain (BRE5 (1–400)) could complement the bre5Δ-glo3 mutant. In contrast, deletion of the NTF2-like domain (BRE5-(146–515)) responsible for the interaction with Ubp3p abolished the ability of Bre5p to rescue the viability of bre5Δ-glo3 mutant (Fig. 1B). ER Retrieval Defect in Cells Disrupted for BRE5—Glo3p is one of the GTPase-activating proteins (GAP) for the small GTPase ADP-ribosylation factor 1 (Arf1p). Arf1p and the heptameric coatomer complex (α, β, β′, γ, δ, ϵ, ζ-COP) form the coat protein complex I (COPI) involved in retrograde transport within the Golgi apparatus (16Orci L. Stamnes M. Ravazzola M. Amherdt M. Perrelet A. Sollner T.H. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1997; 90: 335-349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar) and from the Golgi to the ER (13Letourneur F.

Science. 1994; 263: 1629-1631Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). The GDP-bound form of Arf1p is likely recruited on Golgi membranes by the transmembrane protein p23 prior nucleotide exchange. Arf1p-GTP as well as p23/p24 proteins then triggers coatomer binding and coat polymerization (18Nickel W. Brugger B. Wieland F.T. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 3235-3240Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Palmer D.J. Helms J.B. Beckers C.J. Orci L. Rothman J.E. J. Biol.

A. 1992; 89: 6408-6412Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). Following budding, Arf1p-dependent GTP hydrolysis initiates vesicle uncoating (21Tanigawa G. Orci L. Amherdt M. Ravazzola M.

The three yeast Arf1-GAPs share overall similarity but appear specialized in specific transport routes. Gcs1p and Age2p have been shown to be implicated in transport from the trans Golgi network (23Poon P.P. Nothwehr S.F. Singer R.A. Johnston G.C. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 1239-1250Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), whereas Glo3p is the major GAP involved in ER retrieval (24Dogic D. de Chassey B. Pick E. Cassel D. Lefkir Y. Hennecke S. Cosson P. Letourneur F. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 78: 305-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The genetic interaction between GLO3 and BRE5 led us to analyze whether deletion of BRE5 could induce defects in retrograde transport from the Golgi to the ER. For this purpose, we used a previously described in vivo assay to monitor ER retrieval of dilysine-tagged proteins in yeast (13Letourneur F. Gaynor E.C. Hennecke S. Demolliere C. Duden R. Emr S.D. Riezman H. Cosson P. Cell. 1994; 79: 1199-1207Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar). Indeed, it has been clearly shown that dilysine signals confer a COPI-mediated localization to the ER (13Letourneur F. Gaynor E.C. Hennecke S. Demolliere C. Duden R. Emr S.D. Riezman H. Cosson P. Cell. 1994; 79: 1199-1207Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar). This assay is based on the use of MATa cells deleted from the endogenous α-factor receptor STE2 gene but expressing a fusion protein between Ste2p and WBP1. The dilysine retrieval motif of WBP1 confers an ER localization to the chimeric protein resulting in the inability of these ste2Δ Ste2-WBP1 (WT) cells to mate (Fig. 2A). However, when retrograde transport from Golgi to ER is defective, Ste2-WBP1 is mislocalized to the cell surface, allowing mating to occur. In particular, a ts mutation in the α subunit of the coatomer (ret1.1) was able to restore mating (Fig. 2A) as described previously (13Letourneur F. Gaynor E.C. Hennecke S. Demolliere C. Duden R. Emr S.D. Riezman H. Cosson P. Cell. 1994; 79: 1199-1207Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar). Deletion of BRE5 led to a partial rescue of the ability to mate indicating that lack of Bre5p causes a defect in ER retrieval (Fig. 2A). Mutations affecting ER retrieval of dilysine-tagged proteins fall into two classes distinguished by their ability to alter, or not, binding of coatomer to dilysine motifs in vitro (13Letourneur F. Gaynor E.C. Hennecke S. Demolliere C. Duden R. Emr S.D. Riezman H. Cosson P. Cell. 1994; 79: 1199-1207Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar). To better characterize the effects of BRE5 deletion on retrograde transport, lysates from BRE5 and bre5Δ cells were incubated with purified recombinant fusion proteins between GST and WBP1 peptides presenting dilysine (GST-WBP1) or diserine motifs (GST-WBP1-SS) and pulled down with glutathione beads as described previously (17Cosson P. Letourneur F. Science. 1994; 263: 1629-1631Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). Bound proteins were revealed by immunoblotting with antibodies to β′-COP and δ-COP, two subunits of COPI coatomer (Fig. 2B). Neither β′-COP nor δ-COP were retained on GST-WBP1-SS beads. Although both subunits were bound to GST-WBP1 beads, the efficiency of recruitment was affected upon BRE5 deletion. A precise quantification performed on three independent experiments indicated that the amount of bound β′-COP and δ-COP from bre5Δ cells extracts corresponded to 50 and 65%, respectively, of material bound using WT extracts. This result suggests that coatomer assembly is likely altered in bre5Δ cells thus inducing an ER retrieval defect. Consistently, cells disrupted for BRE5 encoding gene have been shown to be hypersensitive to brefeldine A (25Muren E. Oyen M. Barmark G. Ronne H. Yeast. 2001; 18: 163-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), an inhibitor of nucleotide exchange on the ADP-ribosylation factor, which blocks coatomer binding to membranes (26Lowe M. Kreis T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30725-30730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Bre5p·Ubp3p Complex Deubiquitinates the COPI Subunit β′-COP/Sec27p—To analyze the molecular basis of the ER retrieval defect in bre5Δ cells, expression levels of the different COPI components were analyzed in wild-type, bre5Δ, and ubp3Δ cells. No significant difference could be observed in the steady-state level of the Arf-GAPs Gcs1p or Glo3p nor coatomer subunits α-COP, β-COP, δ-COP, γ-COP, or ϵ-COP in the various strains (Fig. 3A). In contrast, a modified form of β′-COP with slower mobility than the β′-COP main signal was reproducibly detected in bre5Δ and ubp3Δ cells but not in wild-type cells (Fig. 3A). The modified form of β′-COP not only displayed a molecular mass of ∼10 kDa greater than unmodified β′-COP and accumulated in the absence of the Ubp3p·Bre5p deubiquitination complex, but β′-COP has also been shown to be ubiquitinated (27Peng J. Schwartz D. Elias J.E. Thoreen C.C. Cheng D. Marsischky G. Roelofs J. Finley D. Gygi S.P. Nat. Biotechnol. 2003; 21: 921-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (1319) Google Scholar). Thus the modified form of β′-COP most likely corresponds to monoubiquitinated β′-COP that could not be incorporated into the COPI complex and therefore affects coatomer assembly and ER retrieval. We recently reported that absence of the Bre5p·Ubp3p complex induces an accumulation of monoubiquitinated Sec23p that facilitates its subsequent polyubiquitination and degradation by the 26 S proteasome (10Cohen M. Stutz F. Belgareh N. Haguenauer-Tsapis R. Dargemont C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 661-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). To address a possible role of the Bre5p·Ubp3p complex in β′-COP turnover, we first measured β′-COP stability in the presence of cycloheximide and found that the half-life of this protein is shorter in bre5Δ cells than in WT cells (data not shown). Since polyubiquitination rather than modification with a single ubiquitin triggers proteins for recognition and degradation by the 26 S proteasome, modification of β′-COP was analyzed in cim3-1 thermosensitive mutants defective for the proteasome activity (28Ghislain M. Udvardy A. Mann C. Nature. 1993; 366: 358-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). A 2-h shift from 23 to 37 °C in the presence of cycloheximide led to a rapid degradation of β′-COP in wild-type cells (CIM3) and bre5Δ cells, whereas it was stabilized in cim3-1 strains (Fig. 3B) indicating that degradation of β′-COP depends on the proteasome activity. Interestingly, deletion of BRE5 in cim3-1 cells led to an accumulation at 37 °C of both unmodified and high molecular weight forms of β′-COP likely corresponding to polyubiquitinated species of β′-COP (Fig. 3B). These results indicate that absence of a functional Ubp3p·Bre5p complex led to a faster polyubiquitination and degradation of β′-COP by the proteasome. Mammalian β′-COP Interacts with USP10—G3BP1, one of the two human proteins similar to Bre5p, has been previously shown to interact with USP10 (11Soncini C. Berdo I. Draetta G. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 3869-3879Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), a human ubiquitin protease sharing 46% similarity and 27% identity with Ubp3p mainly concentrated in the catalytic domain (Fig. 4A). Using a twohybrid assay, we found that USP10 not only interacts with G3BP1 but also with G3BP2, the second human homologue of Bre5p (data not shown). Moreover, similarly to the Ubp3p·Bre5p complex, the interaction between USP10 and G3BP1 or G3BP2 is mediated by the NTF2-like domain of G3BPs (data not shown). Yeast β′-COP is very similar to bovine β′-COP (43% identity, 64% similarity). To test whether Ubp3p·Bre5p and USP10·G3BP complexes could exert their deubiquitination activity on similar substrates, we tested whether human USP10 could interact with COPI subunits. For this purpose, we used a two-hybrid approach where the LexA DNA binding domain alone or fused to USP10 was co-expressed with bovine COPI coatamer subunits fused to the Gal4 activating domain (Fig. 4B). We found that Gal4-β′-COP strongly interacted with LexA-USP10, whereas the other fusion proteins did not display any significant interaction using this assay. This result suggests that the yeast Ubp3p·Bre5p and the mammalian USP10·G3BP complexes could be functionally homologous and could regulate Golgi to ER transport by acting on the function and stability of β′-COP substrate. In this study, we show that inactivation of the Ubp3p·Bre5p deubiquitination complex induces an ER retrieval defect likely due to a defect of COPI coat assembly. This partial defect led to cell lethality when combined with mutation on the ArfGAP Glo3p. Further analysis indicates that the COPI subunit β′-COP is a substrate of the Ubp3p·Bre5p complex. Indeed, inactivation of the deubiquitination complex leads to an accumulation of ubiquitinated β′-COP and a faster proteasome-dependent degradation of the protein. The ability of USP10 to interact with mammalian β′-COP suggests that regulation of Golgi to ER transport by ubiquitination could also occur in mammals. All together, these data therefore indicate that the Ubp3p·Bre5p complex is able to regulate retrograde transport from the Golgi apparatus to the ER by acting on the essential COPI subunit β′-COP. We have previously shown that the Ubp3p·Bre5p complex can act on anterograde transport between ER and Golgi compartments by deubiquitinating the COPII protein Sec23p (10Cohen M. Stutz F. Belgareh N. Haguenauer-Tsapis R. Dargemont C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 661-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Therefore, the Ubp3p·Bre5p complex appears to co-regulate anterograde and retrograde transports between ER and Golgi compartments by deubiquitinating and controlling expression levels of COPII Sec23p and COPI β′-COP, respectively. Interestingly, Ubp3p has been implicated in pheromone signaling (29Wang Y. Dohlman H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15766-15772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), G3BP1 in the Ras signaling pathway (30Parker F. Maurier F. Delumeau I. Duchesne M. Faucher D. Debussche L. Dugue A. Schweighoffer F. Tocque B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2561-2569Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), and Bre5p as well as G3BP1 can be phosphorylated (31Ficarro S.B. McCleland M.L. Stukenberg P.T. Burke D.J. Ross M.M. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. White F.M. Nat. Biotechnol. 2002; 20: 301-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (1498) Google Scholar, 32Gallouzi I.E. Parker F.

It is therefore tempting to speculate that Bre5p/G3BP phosphorylation is regulated by signaling cascades and controls the activity of the ubiquitination complex. Ubp3·Bre5 complex might therefore contribute to coordinate and adapt anterograde and retrograde transport routes between ER and Golgi compartments to the cellular environment and physiological conditions.

Previous studies demonstrated that L-selectin ligand sulfotransferase (LSST) forms 6-sulfo sialyl Lewis x (sLex) on both core 2 branch and MECA-79-positive extended core 1 O-glycans, but the chemical nature and roles of HEV ligands elaborated by LSST and core 2 β1,6-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase-1 (Core2GlcNAcT) have been undefined. In the present study, we have generated mutant mice with deficient LSST and show that inactivation of LSST gene alone leads to only partial impairment of lymphocyte homing to peripheral lymph nodes and moderate reduction in lymphocyte counts in the peripheral lymph nodes, despite the fact that L-selectin ligands that contain 6-sulfo sLex are reduced at HEV. By contrast, LSST/Core2GlcNAcT double null mice exhibited a markedly reduced lymphocyte homing and reduced lymphocyte counts as a result of significantly decreased 6-sulfo sLex on HEV L-selectin counterreceptors, relative to LSST- or Core2GlcNAcT-single null mice. Moreover, induction of LSST and Core2GlcNAcT transcripts was observed in HEV-like structure formed in the salivary gland of the non-obese diabetic mouse, which displays chronic inflammation.

Lymphocyte recirculation through lymph nodes and Peyer's patches is important for detection of foreign antigens by the immune system and subsequent processes that neutralize these molecules. Lymphocyte recirculation critically depends on interaction between the leukocyte adhesion molecule L-selectin and counterreceptors restricted on specialized post capillary venules, high endothelial venules (HEV) 1The abbreviations used are: HEV, high endothelial venule; LSST, L-selectin ligand sulfotransferase; Core2GlcNAcT, β1,6-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase-1; Core1-β3GlcNAcT, core 1 extension β1,3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase; sLex, sialyl Lewis x; NOD, non-obese diabetic; EGFP; enhanced green fluorescent protein; CMFDA, 5-chloromethyl fluorescence diacetate; GlcNAc6ST-1, GlcNAc-6-O-sulfotransferase-1; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; ES cells, embryonic stem cells. in secondary lymphoid organs. The counterreceptors on the luminal surface of HEV capture circulating lymphocytes via L-selectin-dependent adhesive interactions that lead, in turn, to lymphocyte tethering and rolling, chemokine-dependent activation, integrin-mediated firm attachment, and lymphocyte transmigration (1.Springer T.A.

L-selectin and its ligands are also implicated in lymphocyte recruitment in certain chronic inflammation. HEV-like microvasculature is induced on endothelium in association with insulitis characteristic of the non-obese diabetic (NOD) mouse and the rejection of heart transplants in rodents and humans (5.Hanninen A.

Similarly, HEV-like structure is observed in inflammatory bowel diseases, rheumatoid arthritis, lymphocytic thyroiditis, and the hyperplastic thymus of the AKR mouse (9.Salmi M. Granfors K.

It has been suggested that recruitment of lymphocytes by induced L-selectin ligand may contribute to the pathogenesis of these diseases, which is characteristic of induced HEV-like microvasculature. L-selectin present on leukocytes is a carbohydrate-binding protein characterized by dependence on Ca2+ for its activity. HEV-borne L-selectin counterreceptors include GlyCAM-1, CD34, podocalyxin, Sgp200, endoglycan, and MAdCAM-1, all of which have mucin-like domains that act as scaffolding for O-linked oligosaccharides (13.Rosen S.D. Am. J. Pathol. 1999; 155: 1013-1020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The function of these L-selectin counterreceptors entirely depends on their decoration with specific sialylated, fucosylated, and sulfated oligosaccharides, which contain 6-sulfo sialyl Lewis X (sLex), (NeuNAcα2→3Galβ1→4[Fucα1→3(sulfo→6)]GlcNAcβ1→R) (14.Imai Y.

Indeed, recent studies demonstrate that mouse and human L-selectin ligand sulfotransferase (LSST, also known as HEC-GlcNAc6ST or GlcNAc6ST-2 (18.Fukuda M. Hiraoka N. Akama T.O. Fukuda M.N. J. Biol.

More recent studies demonstrated that LSST together with core 1 extension enzyme (Core1-β3GlcNAcT) forms the MECA-79 epitope, defined as Galβ1→4(sulfo→6)GlcNAcβ1→3Galβ1→3GalNAcα1→R, which is a partial structure of 6-sulfo sLex on extended core 1 O-glycans (20.Yeh J.C.

The MECA-79 antibody also binds to 6-sulfo sLex on extended core 1 and inhibits both in vivo and ex vivo lymphocyte attachment to HEV by neutralizing L-selectin ligands (20.Yeh J.C. Hiraoka N.

Moreover, 6-sulfo sLex on bi-antennary O-glycans containing both core 2 branch and core 1 extension yield more efficient L-selectin-dependent cell adhesion than 6-sulfo sLex on core 2 branch or core 1 extension alone, indicating a synergistic effect of bivalent ligands on L-selectin-mediated adhesion (20.Yeh J.C.

Gene inactivation of LSST through homologous recombination results in significant reduction in lymphocyte homing and loss of MECA-79 at the luminal side of HEV. LSST null (LSSTΔ) mice, however, still exhibit slightly over 50% of lymphocyte homing to the peripheral lymph nodes relative to wild-type mice (23.Hemmerich S. Bistrup A. Singer M.S. van Zante A. Lee J.K. Tsay D. Peters M. Carminati J.L. Brennan T.J. Carver-Moore K. Leviten M. Fuentes M.E. Ruddle N.H. Rosen S.D.

These observations thus indicate that 6-sulfo sLex on extended core 1 O-glycans is almost absent in LSST null mice, but 6-sulfo sLex on other structures remaining after inactivation of LSST must play a role as L-selectin ligands. One of those ligands is likely to be 6-sulfo sLex on core 2-branched O-glycans (16.Hiraoka N. Petryniak B. Nakayama J. Tsuboi S. Suzuki M. Yeh J.C. Izawa D. Tanaka T. Miyasaka M. Lowe J.B. Fukuda M.

The formation of 6-sulfo sLex on core 2-branched O-glycans requires core 2 β1,6-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase-I (Core2GlcNAcT) (24.Bierhuizen M.F. Fukuda M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9326-9330Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). In Core2GlcNAcT null (Core2GlcNAcTΔ) mice established previously, L-, P-, or E-selectin ligand on neutrophils was significantly diminished. Concomitantly, neutrophil recruitment to inflamed peritoneum in Core2GlcNAcTΔ mice was diminished to 20% of levels seen in wild-type mice (25.Ellies L.G. Tsuboi S. Petryniak B. Lowe J.B. Fukuda M. Marth J.D. Immunity. 1998; 9: 881-890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). However, the same studies showed that Core2GlcNAcTΔ mice exhibited only partial reduction in lymphocyte homing and lymphocyte counts in the peripheral lymph nodes. Analysis of O-glycans remaining after Core2GlcNAcT inactivation demonstrated that no core 2-branched O-glycans was detected in GlyCAM-1 isolated from HEV and that the majority of O-glycans contains core 1 extension in HEV of Core2GlcNAcTΔ mice (20.Yeh J.C. Hiraoka N. Petryniak B. Nakayama J. Ellies L.G. Rabuka D. Hindsgaul O. Marth J.D. Lowe J.B. Fukuda M. Cell. 2001; 105: 957-969Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). These results suggest that almost all of the 6-sulfo sLex on L-selectin counterreceptors reside either on core 2-branch or extended core 1 O-glycans. However, precise structures of these O-glycans and their roles in lymphocyte homing have remained undefined. To determine the roles of LSST and Core2GlcNAcT in L-selectin ligand biosynthesis at HEV, we first generated mutant mice deficient in LSST and then generated double knockout mice deficient in both LSST and Core2GlcNAcT by cross-breeding LSSTΔ mice with Core2GlcNAcTΔ mice, which had been previously established (25.Ellies L.G. Tsuboi S. Petryniak B. Lowe J.B. Fukuda M. Marth J.D. Immunity. 1998; 9: 881-890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Double knockout mice deficient in both LSST and Core2GlcNAcT exhibited significantly reduced lymphocyte homing activity and lymphocyte numbers in the peripheral lymph nodes, compared with single knockout LSSTΔ or Core2GlcNAcTΔ mice, or to wild-type mice. In addition, LSST and Core2GlcNAcT transcripts were detected in HEV-like microvaculate endothelium formed in the salivary gland of NOD mice. These results together with structural analysis of HEV-derived O-glycan ligands demonstrate that LSST and Core2GlcNAcT cooperatively synthesize L-selectin ligands and together play dominant roles in lymphocyte homing and suggest that LSST and Core2GlcNAcT play a critical role in lymphocyte trafficking during chronic inflammation. Generation of Targeted ES Cells—A genomic fragment of ∼25 kb containing mouse LSST gene was isolated from a mouse genomic library as a BAC clone (Research Genetics) and subcloned into pBlue-script II SK(-) (Stratagene). To disrupt the enzymatic function of mouse LSST, and to create a fusion protein of enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) with the N terminus of LSST, including the short cytoplasmic domain, transmembrane domain, and stem region, a 1-kb NdeI and BglII segment of the LSST gene encoding the catalytic domain was replaced with a 2-kb fragment carrying EGFP-F and the G418 resistance selection (PGKneo) cassette. The inserted EGFP-F segment containing EGFP coding sequences plus the Ras farnesylation signal, and an SV40 poly(A) signal was prepared by amplification of pEGFP-F vector (Clontech), in which the multicloning sites had been deleted by PCR using 5′-TCCATATGTCCGTCCACAGACACCTTATGGTGAGCAAGGGCGAGGAG-3′ (5′-primer) and 5′-CGGGATCCGCGTTAAGATACATTGATGAGTTTG-3′ (3′-primer). The EGFP-F and PGKneo cassette was flanked by 1 kb of mouse genomic DNA at its 5′ region and by 4.5 kb of mouse genomic DNA at its 3′ region. The targeting vector was linearized and electroporated into R1 ES cells. ES cells were positively selected for G418 resistance and negatively selected by expression of the diphtheria toxin gene, inserted into the targeting vector. Targeting events were identified by PCR amplification with EGFP-specific primer (R1M) and a primer (F1M) specific for a LSST sequence outside the LSST sequence contained in the targeting vector (see Fig. 1A). ES cells positively screened by PCR were confirmed by Southern blot analysis using XbaI digestion and the genomic probe A in the 5′ region of homologous recombination (20 kb WT, 10.5 kb mutant) and EcoRV digestion and genomic probe B in the 3′ arm of the LSST genome using the targeting vector (30 kb WT, 5 kb mutant). Generation of LSSTΔ Mice and LSSTΔ/Core2GlcNAcTΔ Mice—Chimeric males were produced by injection of LSST+/- ES cells into blastocysts and were bred with C57BL/6 females to produce F1 heterozygotes. Germ line transmission was confirmed by PCR, and LSST+/- progeny were backcrossed onto C57BL/6 wild-type mice. Heterozygous males and females were mated to produce wild-type, heterozygous, and homozygous mutant animals. For PCR analysis to genotype the mice, genomic DNA was purified from mouse tail and used as template. F1M and R1M primer pairs were used for detection of the mutated allele. For detection of the wild-type allele, F1W and R1W were used (see Fig. 1A). In some analyses, the following PCR primers were used for simultaneous detection of wild-type and mutant alleles in the same PCR reaction; 5′-AAGAAAGGGAGGCTGCTGATGTTC-3′ (F2W) was used as the 5′-primer and 5′-TCCACCATATCAAAGGGCTGCTGA-3′ (R2W) and R1M as 3′-primers. LSSTΔ mice were back-crossed with C57BL/6 for a total of three generations. C57BL/6 Core2GlcNAcTΔ mice and C57BL/6 LSSTΔ mice were then bred to generate a C57BL/6 LSSTΔ/Core2GlcNAcTΔ strain. Detection of LSST-GFP Chimeric Protein and MECA-79 Antigen and Binding of L-selectin-IgM Chimeric Protein to HEV—The extracellular domain of human L-selectin was amplified by PCR and linked to the DNA sequence encoding for the CH2, CH3, and CH4 domains of human IgM in pcDNA1.1 as described for the mouse L-selectin IgM chimera (26.Maly P. Thall A. Petryniak B. Rogers C.E. Smith P.L. Marks R.M. Kelly R.J. Gersten K.M. Cheng G. Saunders T.L. Camper S.A. Camphausen R.T. Sullivan F.X. Isogai Y. Hindsgaul O. von Andrian U.H. Lowe J.B.

Binding of L-selectin-IgM was detected by goat biotinylated anti-human IgM antibodies followed by Texas red-conjugated avidin. MECA-79 antigen was detected using MECA-79 antibody (BD Pharmingen (21.Streeter P.R. Rouse B.T. Butcher E.C. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 1853-1862Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar)), followed by rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-rat IgM. The expression of LSST in HEV was detected by fluorescence derived from LSST-EGFP chimeric protein. Isolation of GlyCAM-1—GlyCAM-1 was prepared from sera of wild-type and LSSTΔ mice as described previously (27.Bruehl R.E. Bertozzi C.R. Rosen S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32642-32648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE, blotted to a nitrocellulose membrane and reacted with anti-GlyCAM-1 antibodies that had been prepared as described previously (27.Bruehl R.E. Bertozzi C.R. Rosen S.D. J. Biol.

The bound antibodies were visualized by ECL (Amersham Biosciences). Structural Analysis of Oligosaccharides Attached to GlyCAM-1— Axillary, cervical, and mesenteric lymph nodes from wild-type, LSSTΔ, Core2GlcNAcTΔ, or LSSTΔ/Core2GlcNAcTΔ mice were metabolically labeled with 0.5 mCi/ml [3H]galactose (20.Yeh J.C.

GlyCAM-1 was purified from the condition medium using a column of anti-GlyCAM-1 antibodies conjugated to UltraLink Biosupport Medium (Pierce), as described previously (27.Bruehl R.E. Bertozzi C.R.

O-Glycans from the purified GlyCAM-1 were isolated and separated by QAE-Sephadex A-25 column chromatography in 10 mm pyridineacetate buffer (pH 5.5) before and after removal of sialic acid by mild acid hydrolysis as described previously (20.Yeh J.C.

Monosulfated, disulfated, and trisulfated O-glycans, eluted with 70 mm, 120 mm (plus 140 mm), and 250 mm (plus 300 mm) NaCl, respectively, were separately applied to a Bio-Gel P-4 gel filtration column as described previously (16.Hiraoka N.

Fractionated O-glycans were then sequentially treated with α1,3-fucosidase and Jack bean β-galactosidase followed by β-N-acetylhexosaminidase B, which cleaves only non-sulfated N-acetylglucosamine. After these digestions, the majority of oligosaccharides should yield (sulfo→6)GlcNAcβ1→6(Galβ1→3)GalNAcOH from sulfated core 2-branch O-glycans and (sulfo→6)GlcNAcβ1→3Galβ1→3GalNAcOH from sulfated, extended core 1 O-glycans, respectively. These two compounds can be separated by a shallow gradient elution using a Partisil SAX-10 column (29.Hiraoka N. Nakagawa H. Ong E. Akama T.O. Fukuda M.N. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20188-20196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) or an Asahipak NH2-bonded HPLC column as described previously (20.Yeh J.C. Hiraoka N. Petryniak B.

Oligosaccharides obtained after each step of sequential glycosidase digestion were also fractionated using the Asahipak column. For this, the sample was eluted for 10 min with a linear gradient from solvent A (64% acetonitrile, 36% H2O) to a 70:30 mixture of solvent A and solvent B (64% acetonitrile, 36% 69 mm NaH2PO4/H2O, pH 4.2), followed by a 40-min linear gradient elution to a 30:70 mixture of solvent A and solvent B. Finally, the sample was eluted for 5 min with a linear gradient elution to 100% of solvent B. Oligosaccharides were also digested by hexosaminidase A, which cleaves both non-sulfated and sulfated N-acetylglucosamine (30.Kytzia H.J. Sandhoff K. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 7568-7572Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Standard oligosaccharides were prepared from Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing LSST and Core1-β3GlcNAcT or Core2GlcNAcT-I or both. Lymphocyte Homing—Lymphocyte homing in vivo was assayed as described previously (26.Maly P. Thall A. Petryniak B. Rogers C.E. Smith P.L. Marks R.M. Kelly R.J. Gersten K.M. Cheng G. Saunders T.L.

Briefly, 2.5 × 107 5-chloromethyl fluorescein diacetate (CMFDA)-labeled lymphocytes from spleen and mesenteric lymph nodes, derived from wild-type mice, were injected into tail veins of 7- to 8-week-old wild-type, LSSTΔ, Core2GlcNAcTΔ, and LSSTΔ/Core2GlcNAcTΔ mice. After 1 h, animals were sacrificed, and peripheral (axillary and cervical) and mesenteric lymph nodes, Peyer's patches, and spleen were isolated. Lymphocyte suspensions were prepared from these organs and subjected to fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis to determine the fractional content of fluorescent cells. Measurement of L-selectin-mediated Rolling on GlyCAM-1 Samples from Wild-type, LSSTΔ, Core2GlcNAcTΔ, and LSSTΔ/Core2GlcNAcTΔ Mice—GlyCAM-1 was prepared from sera of wild-type, LSSTΔ, Core2GlcNAcTΔ, and LSSTΔ/Core2GlcNAcTΔ mice, as described above, and captured on polystyrene plates, which had been coated with anti-GlyCAM-1 antibodies (20.Yeh J.C.

The amount of GlyCAM-1 from wild-type, LSSTΔ, Core2GlcNAcTΔ, and LSSTΔ/Core2GlcNAcTΔ mice was adjusted to provide equivalent amounts of GlyCAM-1 as assessed by Western blotting analysis using the anti-GlyCAM-1 antibodies. Lymphocytes were initially introduced into the flow chamber at a wall shear stress of 5 dynes/cm2 for 15 s, followed by the termination of flow, allowing cells to adhere under static conditions. Flow rate was then reinitiated at various shear forces. Image analysis was performed and analyzed as described (20.Yeh J.C. Hiraoka N. Petryniak B. Nakayama J. Ellies L.G. Rabuka D. Hindsgaul O.

At the same time, rolling velocities for individual cells (between 120 and 200 rolling cells per experiment) were determined for the results obtained on GlyCAM-1 isolated from wild-type and LSSTΔ mice as described previously (16.Hiraoka N.

In Situ Hybridization and Immunohistochemistry—The immunohistochemical staining of MECA-79 antigen and in situ hybridization for mouse Core1-β3GlcNAcT, Core2GlcNAcT, LSST, and FucT-VII were performed on the inflamed salivary gland of a 55-week-old NOD mouse as described previously (16.Hiraoka N.

Digoxigenin-labeled antisense and sense RNA probes were prepared by in vitro transcription from pGEM-3Zf (+) (Promega) containing a partial cDNA sequence of mouse Core1-β3GlcNAcT (nucleotides +705 to +854), Core2GlcNAcT (nucleotides +991 to + 1140), LSST (nucleotides +556 to +744), or FucT-VII (nucleotides +2196 to + 2497). Hybridized probes were detected by alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-digoxigenin antibody, and no specific signals were found in control experiments using sense probes. Immunohistochemistry with the MECA-79 antibody was performed by the indirect immunoperoxidase method. Control experiments were done by omitting primary antibody from the procedure, and in this case no specific staining was seen. Counterstaining was carried out with hematoxylin. Disruption of the Mouse LSST Locus—The gene encoding LSST was incorporated into a targeting vector by replacing a portion of the LSST gene with cDNAs encoding EGFP and the neomycin resistance enzyme. After homologous recombination, the resultant gene encodes the cytoplasmic, transmembrane, and stem regions of LSST (amino acid resides 1-32), which are fused with EGFP and driven by the LSST promoter (Fig. 1A). It has been shown that the cytoplasmic, transmembrane, and stem regions of Golgi-associated enzymes specify Golgi retention (33.Munro S. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3577-3588Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 34.Aoki D. Lee N. Yamaguchi N. Dubois C. Fukuda M.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Targeted ES cell clones were injected into C57BL/6 blastocysts, and F1 crosses of chimeric mice produced LSSTΔ as determined by PCR of genomic DNA (Fig. 1B). Intercrosses of heterozygous progeny yielded litters of normal size with Mendelian transmission of the null allele.

https://openalex.org/W2129727440,"In a large group of organisms including low G + C bacteria and eukaryotic cells, DNA synthesis at the replication fork strictly requires two distinct replicative DNA polymerases. These are designated pol C and DnaE in Bacillus subtilis. We recently proposed that DnaE might be preferentially involved in lagging strand synthesis, whereas pol C would mainly carry out leading strand synthesis. The biochemical analysis of DnaE reported here is consistent with its postulated function, as it is a highly potent enzyme, replicating as fast as 240 nucleotides/s, and stalling for more than 30 s when encountering annealed 5′-DNA end. DnaE is devoid of 3′ → 5′-proofreading exonuclease activity and has a low processivity (1–75 nucleotides), suggesting that it requires additional factors to fulfill its role in replication. Interestingly, we found that (i) DnaE is SOS-inducible; (ii) variation in DnaE or pol C concentration has no effect on spontaneous mutagenesis; (iii) depletion of pol C or DnaE prevents UV-induced mutagenesis; and (iv) purified DnaE has a rather relaxed active site as it can bypass lesions that generally block other replicative polymerases. These results suggest that DnaE and possibly pol C have a function in DNA repair/mutagenesis, in addition to their role in DNA replication.

In all living organisms, DNA replication is carried out by a functionally highly conserved protein complex. Genetic and biochemical data have shown that this complex, called DNA polymerase holoenzyme, contains two copies of an essential replicative DNA polymerase in Escherichia coli, T4 and T7 phages, and SV40 (reviewed in Refs. 1.Kelvin Z.

This higher level of complexity would hold true for many organisms as follows: (i) systematic sequencing of bacterial genomes (more than 100 completed to date) revealed that ∼50% carry at least two copies of dnaE or contain dnaE and polC (no genome containing only polC has been detected so far), and (ii) pol δ and pol ϵ seem to be ubiquitous in eukaryotes. It is well established that pol C in bacteria and pol δ in eukaryotes are required at the replication fork (5.Burgers P.M.

On the other hand, the specific roles of DnaE and pol ϵ during replication are still not known. In B. subtilis, it was reported that the purified DnaE protein has a DNA polymerase activity devoid of proofreading activity and presents a high affinity for dNTP (14.Gass K.B. Cozzarelli N.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 7688-7700Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16.Foster K.A. Barnes M.H. Stephenson R.O. Butler M.M. Skow D.J. LaMarr W.A. Brown N.C. Protein Expression Purif. 2003; 27: 90-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Genetic and cytological data as well as in vivo assays of radioactive precursor incorporation have shown that DnaE, like pol C, is essential for the elongation phase of replication and is associated with the replication factory at mid-cell (7.Dervyn E. Suski C. Daniel R. Bruand C. Chapuis J. Errington J. Janniere L. Ehrlich S.D. Science. 2001; 294: 1716-1719Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Moreover, study of plasmid replication intermediates indicated that DnaE plays a role in lagging strand synthesis, whereas pol C is mainly involved in leading strand synthesis (7.Dervyn E. Suski C. Daniel R. Bruand C. Chapuis J. Errington J. Janniere L. Ehrlich S.D. Science. 2001; 294: 1716-1719Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). These results suggest that two different replicative polymerases ensure synthesis of both DNA strands in B. subtilis and, by extension, potentially in all organisms encoding these two polymerases. Interestingly, genes are mostly (78%) colinear with the replication forks in bacteria encoding both pol C and DnaE, whereas they are much more randomly oriented in organisms carrying only the dnaE gene (17.Rocha E. Trends Microbiol. 2002; 10: 393-395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), suggesting a different organization of the replication fork in these bacteria. In this work, we show that B. subtilis DnaE is an efficient DNA polymerase, with moderate processivity and no 3′ → 5′-exonuclease activity. By using templates bearing miscoding or non-coding lesions, we have observed that DnaE is able to bypass AAF adducts and abasic sites (although less efficiently) but not (6-4)TT photoproducts and BaP adducts and that it produces mainly frameshifts rather than base substitution. Furthermore, dnaE transcription and translation are induced ∼3-fold during the SOS response. Interestingly, UV-induced mutagenesis is abolished upon DnaE depletion. These results suggest that DnaE could have dual role in B. subtilis, one with pol C in chromosome replication and the other in DNA mutagenesis during the SOS response. Strains and Expression Vector—B. subtilis strains are all derivatives of strain 168. In HVS614, the dnaE gene is placed under the control of the Pspac promoter (7.Dervyn E. Suski C. Daniel R. Bruand C. Chapuis J. Errington J. Janniere L. Ehrlich S.D. Science. 2001; 294: 1716-1719Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). This strain was obtained by single crossover integration of pMUTIN2 carrying a DNA segment overlapping the 5′-end of the dnaE gene and harbors pMAP65, a plasmid overproducing the LacI repressor (18.Petit M.A. Dervyn E. Rose M. Entian K.D. McGovern S. Ehrlich S.D. Bruand C. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 261-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). This strain thus allows (i) the tight regulation of the Pspac activity upon addition of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside (IPTG) and (ii) the measure of dnaE expression using dnaE:lacZ transcriptional fusion. HVS609 carries a similar Pspac-pol C fusion (7.Dervyn E. Suski C. Daniel R. Bruand C. Chapuis J. Errington J. Janniere L. Ehrlich S.D. Science. 2001; 294: 1716-1719Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The dinR-deficient (DinR–) strain, carrying the interruption mutant dinR::upp-K7, was previously published (19.Fabret C. Ehrlich S.D. Noirot P. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 46: 25-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). E. coli B834(DE3) (hsdS gall cIts857 ind1 metSam7 nin5 lacUV5-T7 gene 1 (20.Studier F.W. Moffatt B.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 189: 113-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (4809) Google Scholar)) was used to overexpress DnaE. DnaE protein was purified using an expression vector pTYB3dnaE derived from the pTYB3 vector (IMPACT-CN system from New England Biolabs). It allows the expression of a C-terminal fusion protein between DnaE and a self-cleavable intein/chitin binding domain tag. Expression of the fusion protein is under the control of the PT7/lac promoter. The dnaE open reading frame was amplified by PCR from the strain B. subtilis 168 using the following primers: P100, 5′-aaggaaaaacATG TCT TTT GTT CAC CTG CAA GTG (containing a BspLu11I restriction site, underlined, compatible with the NcoI site; the sequence of the dnaE gene is in capital letters); and P101, 5′-ggtggttgctcttcgcaCCA CTG TTT TAA AAC GAC GTT TTT TTG (containing a SapI site). The PCR product was digested by BspLu11I and SapI and cloned into the NcoI and SapI sites of pTYB3. Oligonucleotides were from Genset or Genosys. Proteins—pol I Klenow fragment and T7 pol were purchased from Roche Applied Science and New England Biolabs, respectively. DNA sequencing was carried out with Sequenase™ version 2 (APBiotech) according to the manufacturer. For all polymerases, 1 unit of enzyme catalyzes the incorporation of 10 nmol of total nucleotide into acid-insoluble material in 30 min at 37 °C. E. coli SSB was purchased from U. S. Biochemical Corp. Proteinase K was from Roche Applied Science. B. subtilis SSB was a gift from P. Polard. Chemicals—[α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol) and [γ-32P]ATP (6000 Ci/mmol) were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Unlabeled nucleotides were from Amersham Biosciences. Heparin sodium was from Roussel UCLAF. Purification of the B. subtilis DnaE Protein—B834(DE3) cells freshly transformed with pTYB3dnaE were grown to mid log phase at 30 °C in LB medium supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin. At A650 = 0.6, expression was induced by addition of 1 mm IPTG for 4 h. It allows the overproduction of the dnaE-Intein-CBD (where CBD is chitin binding domain) fusion protein to about 1% of total protein in a soluble form. All the following operations were carried out at 4 °C. The cell pellet was resuspended in 50 ml of buffer TEN1000 (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm EDTA, 1 m NaCl), sonicated, and centrifuged at high speed to yield a clear lysate. The clear lysate was subsequently loaded in batch onto 8-ml chitin beads (New England Biolabs). Beads were washed 3 times with 100 ml of buffer TEN2000 (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm EDTA, 2 m NaCl) to get rid of unbound proteins. Intein-mediated self-cleavage was performed by an on-column incubation of the immobilized fusion protein for 42 h with 30 mm DTT in buffer TEN1000. This resulted in the release of 80% pure wild-type DnaE protein. The protein was then further purified by chromatography. DnaE was dialyzed overnight against buffer TEN50 supplemented with 10% glycerol, loaded onto a Hi-Trap Q column (Amersham Biosciences) to eliminate the contaminant DNA, and eluted with a linear NaCl gradient (DnaE elutes at about 215 mm NaCl). The fractions containing DnaE were dialyzed overnight against buffer TEN50 supplemented with 10% glycerol, loaded onto a Hi-Trap heparin column (Amersham Biosciences) to eliminate the main contaminant proteins, and eluted with a linear NaCl gradient (DnaE elutes at about 235 mm NaCl). Salt concentration was increased up to 300 mm NaCl to prevent DnaE precipitation. The protein was then stored at –80 °C in buffer TEN300 supplemented with 10% glycerol and 5 mm DTT. The yield of DnaE was about 4 mg of protein per liter of culture, and its purity was estimated to be 95% after SDS-PAGE and SYPRO Red (Molecular Probes) staining. Protein concentrations were quantified using the Coomassie Protein Assay Kit (Pierce) using BSA as a standard. A gel filtration chromatography was performed using a Superose 12 column (Amersham Biosciences) and buffer TEN50 supplemented with 10% glycerol, to determine the oligomerization state of DnaE. DnaE eluted as a dimer on the gel filtration column. Primer Extension Reactions—A 32P-labeled 30-mer primer P109, 5′-gtaccccggttgataatcagaaaagcccca, was annealed to M13mp18 ssDNA templates (New England Biolabs). Kinetics of primer extension were performed in 60 μl containing 75 ng of primed ssDNA and 60 μm of each dNTP. SSB was added to the reaction mixture as indicated in the figure legends. Reactions were preincubated 5 min at 30 °C in the presence or in the absence of SSB, with all the other components, before DNA polymerase addition. Reaction buffer contained 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 12.5 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 25 μg/ml BSA, and 2% glycerol. At the time indicated in the figures, 10-μl aliquots were taken, and DNA synthesis was stopped by the addition of 25 mm EDTA and 500 μg/ml proteinase K. The mixture was then incubated for 15 min at 55 °C. Reaction products were analyzed by electrophoresis on 0.8% agarose gels (Seakem GTG) under native conditions in TAE buffer (40 mm Tris acetate, pH 8.3, 1 mm EDTA) at 2 V/cm for 16 h. DNA was visualized and analyzed on a STORM apparatus (Amersham Biosciences). Exonuclease Activity—Reactions of 10 μl contained 20 fmol of 32P-labeled primer P109 in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 15 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 25 μg/ml BSA, 1% glycerol, and either 0.5 units of Klenow or 40 fmol of DnaE. At the time indicated in the figure legends, the samples were processed as described above and analyzed on a 12% denaturing (8 m urea) polyacrylamide gel. Electrophoresis was carried out at 60 watts/100 mA for 3 h in TBE buffer (90 mm Tris borate, pH 8.3, 2 mm EDTA). Measurement of Strand Displacement Activity—The procedure used to measure the strand displacement activity has been described previously (21.Canceill D. Viguera E. Ehrlich S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27481-27490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Briefly, a 32P-radiolabeled primer 1212 was annealed to a ssM13mp18 at positions 6326–6310 in 2-fold molar excess. In addition, one of the two following unlabeled oligonucleotides was annealed to ssM13mp18 at positions 6235–6216 in a 2-fold molar excess. Primer 45 (5′-GAA TTC GTA ATC ATG GTC AT-3′) is complementary to the template. Primer 37 (5′-CTA ATC AGG AGA ATT CGT AAT CAT GGT CAT-3′) is identical to number 45 for its 3′-end but possesses at its 5′-end an extra heterology of 10 bases. T7 pol, known to be devoid of strand displacement activity in the absence of SSB (21.Canceill D. Viguera E. Ehrlich S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27481-27490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), was used to test the quality of the substrates. Primer extension reactions were performed as described above, except that they contained 125 ng of doubly primed M13mp18 ssDNA in 50 μl. Aliquots of 5 μl were withdrawn at the indicated times and processed as described above. Enzymatic Assays—β-Galactosidase was assayed as described previously (22.Msadek T. Kunst F. Henner D. Klier A. Rapoport G. Dedonder R. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 824-834Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). β-Galactosidase activities are expressed in Miller units per mg of protein. Protein concentrations were determined using the Coomassie Protein Assay Kit (Pierce) using BSA as a standard. Immunodetection of DnaEBs—Immunization against DnaEBs and serum preparation in the rabbit was entrusted to Eurogentec. Prior to injection, DnaEBs protein was further purified to homogeneity by SDS-PAGE. DnaE levels in the different strains and growth conditions were determined by immunoblot analysis essentially as described previously (23.Petit M.A. Ehrlich D. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3137-3147Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) except for the following modifications. Equal amounts of soluble cellular proteins (equivalent to 3.7 × 107 cells) were separated by 8% SDS-PAGE and transferred to a Hybond PVDF membrane (Amersham Biosciences) by electroblotting using HorizBlot semi-dry transfer system (Atto Instruments). DnaE antibodies were diluted 1:500. Protein G-horseradish peroxidase (Bio-Rad, 1:5000 dilution) was used as a secondary antibody. DnaE was revealed using the ECL+ reagent (Amersham Biosciences) and a Storm apparatus (Amersham Biosciences) and quantified using ImageQuant software. Measure of Spontaneous and UV-induced Mutagenesis—Overnight cultures grown in LB (168) or in LB supplemented with erythromycin (0.6 μg/ml), kanamycin (5 μg/ml), and IPTG (25 μm for spac-DnaE or 100 μm for spac-pol C) were diluted 1000-fold in fresh media supplemented or not with IPTG at the concentration indicated in Fig. 6A. At an A650 of 0.3–0.4, cells from 10-ml aliquots were pelleted by centrifugation and resuspended in 26 ml of minimal salts (supplemented when necessary with IPTG at the same concentration as in the culture). Half of the cells were irradiated at 80 J/m2 in a Petri dish upon gentle agitation. Both irradiated and unirradiated cells were pelleted by centrifugation, resuspended in 5 ml of fresh LB media similarly supplemented with antibiotics and IPTG when required, and incubated at 37 °C until cultures enter stationary phase. UV sensitivity was measured immediately after UV irradiation, plating serial dilution of the cultures on LB agar plates supplemented as in the liquid cultures. Mutagenesis was estimated by determining the frequency of rifampicin-resistant cells (at 10 μg/ml rifampicin) present in unirradiated or irradiated samples at the end of the culture. TLS Substrates—Construction of single-stranded plasmids containing a lesion at a specific position (pUC-L) has been extensively described previously (24.Cordonnier A.M. Lehmann A.R. Fuchs R.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2206-2211Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 25.Napolitano R.L. Fuchs R.P. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1997; 10: 667-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Lesions used in this study and their sequence context were described previously: AAF adducts (26.Lambert I.B. Napolitano R.L. Fuchs R.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1310-1314Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 27.Koffel-Schwartz N. Coin F. Veaute X. Fuchs R.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Science. 1993; 261: 598-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), (6-4)TT photoproduct (29.Becherel O.J. Fuchs R.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 294: 299-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), and BaP adduct (30.Lenne-Samuel N. Janel-Bintz R. Kolbanovskiy A. Geacintov N.E. Fuchs R.P. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 38: 299-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The presence of the lesion on all the template molecules was verified during the construction process by restriction as described previously (24.Cordonnier A.M. Lehmann A.R. Fuchs R.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2206-2211Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 25.Napolitano R.L. Fuchs R.P. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1997; 10: 667-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). For the AP site-containing template, 90-mer oligonucleotides containing a single AP site within the NarI sequence context (5′-GGCXCC-3′, where X represents the abasic site) were purchased from Eurogentec. Lesion Bypass Assays—For all the TLS experiments except AP site-containing templates, assays were performed using single-stranded substrates pUC-L primed with the oligonucleotide 2316, 5′-ACACGACGTTCCGCTAATTCAACC-3′, that hybridizes 90 bases upstream from the lesion. For the AP site-containing template, the primer used was NarL-1, 5′-TGCCAAGCTTAGTCTGTGG-3′, that anneals 1 base before the lesion on the 90-mer template. All reactions were conducted at 37 °C in 20 μl of the following buffer: 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm DTT, 1 mm ATP, 0.1 mg/ml BSA, and 100 μm of each dNTP. SSB (1 molecule of SSB as a monomer/nt, oversaturating amount) was added when using pUC-L substrate to prevent unspecific binding of the polymerase. Replication bypass was performed by incubating 1 fmol of primer/template (pUC-L/2316* or 90-AP/NarL-1*) with 1, 5, and 10 fmol of DnaE for 10 min at 37 °C. Reactions were stopped by addition of 20 mm EDTA and 4 volumes of termination mixture (4 μg of proteinase K, 1% SDS), incubated for 1 h at 37 °C, and ethanolprecipitated. The pellet was then redissolved and restricted for 3 h by EcoRI to determine the length of the bypass products. EcoRI restriction cleaves 11–13 nucleotides downstream from the lesion on the pUC-L templates, thus generating shorter fragments that can be separated by PAGE. No restriction was performed on the 90-mer AP templates. Restriction reactions were further ethanol-precipitated and resuspended in loading buffer (95% formamide, 5% TE, pH 8.0, 0.5% bromphenol blue). The reaction mixtures were heat-denatured, electrophoresed for 3–4 h (2000 V/80 watts) in TBE buffer on 12 or 15% denaturing (8 m urea) polyacrylamide gels, and visualized using a PhosphorImager 445SI (Amersham Biosciences). Specificity of Deoxynucleotide Incorporation by DnaE Protein—32P-Radiolabeled primers that annealed 1 base prior the lesion were used. DnaE (2.5 fmol) was incubated with the primer/template substrates (1 fmol) in the primer extension buffer as described above in the absence or in the presence of only one of each dNTP (G, A, T, or C) at 100 μm final concentration and incubated for 10 min at 37 °C. Reactions were stopped by adding 20 mm EDTA and 4 volumes of loading buffer, electrophoresed on 20% denaturing (8 m urea) polyacrylamide gel, and visualized as described above. DnaE Is a Potent DNA Polymerase Lacking 3′ → 5′-Exonuclease Activity—To explore the biological function of B. subtilis DnaE, the enzyme was purified to homogeneity from E. coli (see “Experimental Procedures”). DNA synthesis on a primed ssDNA showed that DnaE fully replicates the 7.25-kb M13mp18 genome at a speed of 60 nt/s at 37 °C (Fig. 1A, left). Coating of the template with SSB from either E. coli or B. subtilis enhances the rate of synthesis to 120 nt/s (Fig. 1A, middle and right). The rate of synthesis on E. coli SSB-coated ssDNA increases with the temperature from 60 nt/s at 30 °C to 240 nt/s at 47 °C (Fig. 1B). DnaE uses DNA or RNA primers with the same efficiency and is inhibited by NaCl concentration higher than 25 mm (not shown). Protein sequence analysis suggests that B. subtilis DnaE does not contain the 3′ → 5′-exonuclease domain. This was experimentally confirmed as no DnaE-mediated degradation of a 5′-32P-labeled oligonucleotide was observed (Fig. 1C). A similar result was obtained with an oligonucleotide annealed to an ssDNA template (not shown). DnaE Is Poorly Processive—The processivity of DnaE was estimated by single-hit elongation experiments using heparin as a DNA polymerase trap. Preliminary experiments showed that DnaE is not a highly processive enzyme. Indeed, whereas T7 DNA polymerase (T7 pol) incubated with 2 μg of heparin fully replicates a primed M13mp18 ssDNA, 100 ng of heparin fully inhibited DNA synthesis with similar amounts of DnaE (data not shown). To determine more precisely the processivity of DnaE, time course experiments were performed, and extension products were analyzed by denaturing PAGE (Fig. 2). T7 pol and Klenow enzyme were used as controls. The lowest concentrations of enzymes required to efficiently convert a primed M13mp18 ssDNA into dsDNA were used (Fig. 2, lanes 1 of each panel). The polymerases were incubated in the reaction mixture lacking MgCl2, in order to allow DNA polymerase loading without polymerization. Simultaneously, 10 mm MgCl2 and 800 ng of heparin were added to start the synthesis and trap the free and dissociated DNA polymerases, preventing them from (re)loading onto DNA. The efficiency of the trap was independently verified by two means. First, time course experiments were done to verify that the extension pattern did not change between 15 s and 4 min of incubation. Second, heparin was preincubated in the reaction mixture before addition of the polymerase to verify that it fully abolished DNA synthesis (Fig. 2, panel T7 pol, lane 6). In similar conditions, the processivity of Klenow was estimated to be 1–55 nt (Fig. 2, panel Klenow, lanes 3–5), in full agreement with previous measures (31.Kornberg A. Baker T. DNA Replication. 2nd Ed. W. H. Freeman & Co., New York1992: 494-496Google Scholar). For an unknown reason and as reported previously (32.Creighton S. Bloom L.B. Goodman M.F. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 232-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar), heparin is not a perfect trap for Klenow polymerase (some synthesis is observed despite the heparin preincubation, Fig. 2, panel Klenow, lane 6). Nevertheless it can be used successfully to measure the processivity of the enzyme (extension profiles evolve little between 15 s and 4 min). The same procedure was applied to B. subtilis DnaE and revealed that the enzyme alone has a processivity similar to that of Klenow, the main signals indicating extension of 1–55 nt and faint signals up to 130 nt (Fig. 2, panel DnaE, lanes 3–5). Coating the substrate with E. coli SSB slightly increased its processivity as main signals indicate extension of 1–75 nt, and faint signals were still observed up to 130 nt (Fig. 2, panel DnaE + SSBEc, lanes 3–5). SSB from B. subtilis gave similar results (not shown). DnaE Pauses When Encountering Annealed 5′-Ends—In bacteria, Okazaki fragments are synthesized on the lagging strand of the replication fork every second at 37 °C. The lagging strand polymerase binds to the primer, synthesizes about 1000 nt, precisely terminates when encountering the RNA primer of the former Okazaki fragment, and rapidly dissociates from DNA. Considering the possible role of the B. subtilis DnaE polymerase in lagging strand synthesis, we tested its ability to pause in front of various 5′-ends, using a circular ssDNA template carrying two primers 91 nt away, as described previously (see Fig. 3 top) (21.Canceill D. Viguera E. Ehrlich S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27481-27490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Pausing was assessed in the absence or in the presence of SSB (either from E. coli or B. subtilis) at different concentrations. Upon initiation of DNA synthesis both annealed primers are elongated, and a dsDNA molecule is generated. Only the upstream primer is radioactively labeled, and replication from this primer is monitored at various time points, using denaturing PAGE. With a fully annealed downstream primer (primer 45) we observed a strong block of DnaE progression (Fig. 3, B and C). In the absence of SSB, DnaE pauses ≥8 min, although in its presence it pauses ∼30 s. After pausing, DnaE progresses slowly through the dsDNA region indicating that it has a weak strand displacem"
https://openalex.org/W2039847693,"The VacA toxin secreted by Helicobacter pylori is considered to be an important virulence factor in the pathogenesis of peptic ulcer disease and gastric cancer. VacA monomers self-assemble into water-soluble oligomeric structures and can form anion-selective membrane channels. The goal of this study was to characterize VacA-VacA interactions that may mediate assembly of VacA monomers into higher order structures. We investigated potential interactions between two domains of VacA (termed p-33 and p-55) by using a yeast two-hybrid system. p-33/p-55 interactions were detected in this system, whereas p-33/p-33 and p-55/p-55 interactions were not detected. Several p-33 proteins containing internal deletion mutations were unable to interact with wild-type p-55 in the yeast two-hybrid system. Introduction of these same deletion mutations into the H. pylori vacA gene resulted in secretion of mutant VacA proteins that failed to assemble into large oligomeric structures and that lacked vacuolating toxic activity for HeLa cells. Additional mapping studies in the yeast two-hybrid system indicated that only the N-terminal portion of the p-55 domain is required for p-33/p-55 interactions. To characterize further p-33/p-55 interactions, we engineered an H. pylori strain that produced a VacA toxin containing an enterokinase cleavage site located between the p-33 and p-55 domains. Enterokinase treatment resulted in complete proteolysis of VacA into p-33 and p-55 domains, which remained physically associated within oligomeric structures and retained vacuolating cytotoxin activity. These results provide evidence that interactions between p-33 and p-55 domains play an important role in VacA assembly into oligomeric structures."
https://openalex.org/W2001928951,"Inteins are protein-splicing domains present in many proteins. They self-catalyze their excision from the host protein, ligating their former flanks by a peptide bond. The C-terminal residue of inteins is typically an asparagine (Asn). Cyclization of this residue to succinimide causes the final detachment of inteins from their hosts. We studied protein-splicing activity of two inteins with atypical C-terminal residues. One having a C-terminal glutamine (Gln), isolated from Chilo iridescent virus (CIV), and another unique intein, first reported here, with a C-terminal aspartate, isolated from Carboxydothermus hydrogenoformans (Chy). Protein-splicing activity was examined in the wild-type inteins and in several mutants with N- and C-terminal amino acid substitutions. We demonstrate that both wild-type inteins can protein splice, probably by new variations of the typical protein-splicing mechanism. Substituting the atypical C-terminal residue to the typical Asn retained protein-splicing only in the CIV intein. All diverse C-terminal substitutions in the Chy intein (Asp345 to Asn, Gln, Glu, and Ala) abolished protein-splicing and generated N- and C-terminal cleavage. The observed C-terminal cleavage in the Chy intein ending with Ala cannot be explained by cyclization of this residue.

We present and discuss several new models for reactions in the protein-splicing pathway. Inteins are proteins that catalyze their own excision out of diverse host proteins while ligating the polypeptide flanks (N-extein and C-extein) of their host protein. This process, termed protein-splicing, is an intramolecular event, not requiring additional enzymes. Protein-splicing, as currently understood, requires four successive steps, directly involving three conserved intein positions: (i) Cys or Ser at the N terminus of the intein; (ii) Asn at the intein C terminus; and (iii) Cys, Ser, or Thr directly following the intein C terminus (1Paulus H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 447-496Google Scholar, 2Noren C.J. Wang J. Perler F.B. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2000; 39: 450-466Google Scholar). Few inteins with an N-terminal Ala residue differ in the first step of the reaction and have been described (3Southworth M.W. Benner J. Perler F.B. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5019-5026Google Scholar). Protein-splicing typically commences by an N → O or N → S acyl rearrangement of the peptide bond between the N-extein and the N terminus of the intein into an ester intermediate. This step involves the nucleophilic attack of the thiol or hydroxyl side chain of the intein N-terminal amino acid (Cys or Ser, respectively) on the carbonyl group of the adjacent N-extein peptide bond (4Shao Y. Xu M.Q. Paulus H. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3810-3815Google Scholar). Instantaneously, the thiol or hydroxyl, of the residue following the intein C terminus, attacks the ester bond. In inteins with N-terminal Ala residues, the N-terminal peptide bond is not rearranged by the N-terminal Ala but by the nucleophilic group of the residue immediately following the intein C terminus (3Southworth M.W. Benner J. Perler F.B. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5019-5026Google Scholar). In either case, a branched intermediate is formed: the N-extein is connected by an ester bond to the side chain of the first C-extein residue, whereas this residue is also connected by a peptide bond to the intein C terminus (5Xu M.Q. Southworth M.W. Mersha F.B. Hornstra L.J. Perler F.B. Cell. 1993; 75: 1371-1377Google Scholar, 6Xu M.Q. Comb D.G. Paulus H. Noren C.J. Shao Y. Perler F.B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5517-5522Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). This branched intermediate is resolved by a modification of the intein C-terminal residue. In inteins with the typical Asn C-terminal residue, it is proposed that the nucleophilic β-amide nitrogen attacks the carbonyl carbon of the peptide bond adjacent to it. This reaction is suggested to cause the cyclization of the Asn into an aminosuccinimide ring, (Fig. 1) (6Xu M.Q. Comb D.G. Paulus H. Noren C.J. Shao Y. Perler F.B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5517-5522Google Scholar, 7Shao Y. Xu M.Q. Paulus H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10844-10850Google Scholar, 8Chong S. Shao Y. Paulus H. Benner J. Perler F.B. Xu M.Q. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22159-22168Google Scholar). In this step, the two exteins, ligated by an ester bond, detach from the intein. Finally, two independent events occur. The ester bond between the two exteins rapidly rearranges into the more stable amide bond, forming a peptide bond, and the aminosuccinimide C terminus of the intein undergoes gradual hydrolysis into Asn or iso-Asn residues (7Shao Y. Xu M.Q. Paulus H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10844-10850Google Scholar). Intein mutations that inhibit some stages of protein-splicing activity frequently generate protein-splicing side products. These include the cleavage of the C-terminal or N-terminal intein junctions and appearance of the, usually transient, branched intermediate form. Mutational analysis links the formation of these side products with specific amino acids on the intein sequence. It has been shown that substitution of amino acids located on three conserved positions, at the N and C terminus of the intein, and the amino acid directly following the intein C terminus, blocks protein-splicing but still produces some side products. Particularly, substituting the C-terminal Asn into Ala in four different inteins (3Southworth M.W. Benner J. Perler F.B. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5019-5026Google Scholar, 9Xu M.Q. Perler F.B.

An atypical intein with a C-terminal Gln was first reported in the Chilo iridescent virus (CIV) 1The abbreviations used are: CIVChilo iridescent virusMBPmaltose-binding proteinCBDchitin-binding domainMALDI-TOFmatrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight. (12Pietrokovski S. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: R634-R635Google Scholar). Currently, only four inteins are known to have a C-terminal Gln, the CIV intein, integrated into the large subunit of ribonucleotide reductase (R1), and three alleles found within the same integration point in the archaeal PolD DNA polymerase large DP2 subunits from Pyrococcus horikoshii OT3, Pyrococcus abyssi GE5, and Halobacterium species NRC-1. It was suggested that inteins with a C-terminal Gln undergo splicing in a way similar to inteins with C-terminal Asn: by cyclization of Gln into aminoglutarimide (12Pietrokovski S. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: R634-R635Google Scholar). Whereas the suggested reaction is analogous to Asn cyclization into aminosuccinimide, it is chemically less favorable because of the additional CH2 group of Gln. Moreover, Asn to Gln mutations in the C termini of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Pyrococcus species GB-D inteins abolish protein-splicing activity (9Xu M.Q. Perler F.B. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5146-5153Google Scholar, 10Cooper A.A. Chen Y.J. Lindorfer M.A. Stevens T.H. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2575-2583Google Scholar). Chilo iridescent virus maltose-binding protein chitin-binding domain matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight. A unique intein from Carboxydothermus hydrogenoformans DSM 6008 (Chy), first reported here, is an allele of the CIV intein. This intein is atypical, being the only known intein with an Asp in its C terminus. Current protein-splicing mechanisms cannot explain protein-splicing with a C-terminal Asp. The discovery of inteins with atypical C-terminal residues raises questions regarding their protein-splicing activity and the particular biochemical pathway in which this process proceeds. In this study, we show protein-splicing of the CIV intein, with a C-terminal Gln, and of the Chy intein with a C-terminal Asp. C-terminal substitution of these inteins to Asn blocks protein-splicing in the Chy but not in the CIV intein. N-terminal substitution of both inteins to Ala blocks N-terminal cleavage. Mutation analysis of the Chy intein C terminus suggests that C-terminal autocleavage can proceed even with a substitution of the C-terminal Asp by alanine (Ala). Our results support C-terminal autocleavage of the Chy intein with diverse C-terminal amino acids. The Chy intein C-terminal amino acid substitution to Ala enables C-terminal cleavage that cannot proceed by C-terminal residue cyclization. The implications of these results to protein-splicing reactions in particular and protein chemistry in general, are discussed in this report. DNA Samples—The CIV R1 intein gene was amplified by PCR from CIV genomic DNA (provided by James Kalmakoff, University of Otago, New Zealand). C. hydrogenoformans R1 intein gene was amplified by PCR from genomic DNA (supplied by DSMZ, Braunschweig, Germany). Oligonucleotides and PCR Conditions—The oligonucleotides used for cloning and substitution of the C or N termini of the inteins are detailed in Supplementary Materials Table S2. PCR mixtures contained TaqDNA polymerase (1 unit), and its supplied buffer (Sigma), 200 mm dNTP, 10 mm of each primer, and 100 ng of genomic DNA all in a 50-μl reaction. Amplification was carried out using a Biometra thermal cycler. Functional Assay of Protein-splicing—To create a functional assay for protein-splicing activity, a plasmid containing the genes malE and cbd for two protein tags, maltose-binding protein (MBP) and chitin-binding domain (CBD), was assembled as described earlier (13Amitai G. Belenkiy O. Dassa B. Shainskaya A. Pietrokovski S. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 47: 61-73Google Scholar). The resulting plasmid termed pC2C is based on a modification of the pMALC2 vector (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). All intein inserts were cloned between the BamHI and XbaI sites upstream from the cbd and downstream of the malE coding sequences. DNA sequence of all intein inserts was verified by DNA sequencing. Protein Expression—Growth, expression of the different inteins in E. coli, and lysis of bacterial cells followed the same procedures as described previously (13Amitai G. Belenkiy O. Dassa B. Shainskaya A. Pietrokovski S. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 47: 61-73Google Scholar). The supernatant extracted from the lysed cells was used for further analyses. Purification of CIV Wild-type and Mutant Inteins Splicing Products—Protein-splicing products were purified from extracted supernatant over amylose (New England Biolabs) or chitin (New England Biolabs) beads in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 0.2 m NaCl (Buffer A) according to manufacturer's instructions (New England Biolabs, “Expression and Purification of Proteins from Cloned Genes Instruction Manual,” version 4 and “One-Step Purification of Recombinant Proteins Using a Self-cleavable Affinity Tag Instruction Manual,” version 1.2). The purified protein samples were used for mass spectrometry and SDS-PAGE. Prior to gel loading protein samples were heated for 3 min at 100 °C in 62 mm Tris-Cl, 2% SDS, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.01% bromphenol blue, pH 6.8 (Buffer B). Protein-splicing products were eluted by Buffer A containing 10 mm maltose and Buffer B from amylose and chitin beads, respectively. CIV intein protein was purified for mass spectrometry analysis directly from a Tris glycine gel after SDS-PAGE. Purification of Chy Wild-type and Mutant Inteins Splicing Products—Protein-splicing products were purified and eluted in the same method as the CIV protein products described above. Protein products immobilized on chitin were incubated in Buffer A at either 70 or 4 °C for 20 min before elution from beads. Protein products incubated at 4 °C were heated for 3 min at 100 °C in Buffer B prior to SDS-PAGE, and those incubated at 70 °C were directly applied on gels after the addition of Buffer B. Purification of Chy Intein—Chy intein was purified by heat treatment of extracted supernatant at 80 °C for 15 min in Buffer A with 10% glycerol. The heated sample was centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 5 min and the supernatant was subjected to SDS-PAGE. Finally, the band corresponding to the intein Mr was purified from the gel and sent for further mass spectrometry analysis. Protein-splicing Activity Assay—Intein protein-splicing activity was determined by the appearance of the spliced and excised products. Detection by SDS-PAGE of the intein-mediated protein-spliced product MBP-CBD (MC) as compared with a control fusion protein (MC); and detection of intein product (I), spliced of its host protein. Detection of MC product was supported by Western blots, and that of the Chy and CIV intein by mass spectrometry using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF). Protein quantity was estimated by comparing the intensity of Coomassie Blue staining of samples run on the same gel. Protein-splicing products were compared with the total amount of protein in each lane. Stained gels were dried and scanned with a UMAX 610S scanner and analyzed with NIH Image 1.62 software. LC-ESI-MS Peptide Analysis of CIV Mutants—Protein samples of the CIV-C1A, CIV-C1A/Q339N, and C1A-C340Stop mutants were expressed and purified on an amylose affinity column as described above. Purified proteins were concentrated by Centricon® (Millipore, Bedford, MA) mini-columns with a 50-kDa cutoff. All protein samples were equilibrated to a concentration of 500 μg/ml and examined for purity using SDS-PAGE. Proteins were denatured by mixing with 8 m urea, 10 mm ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.0. Urea concentration was lowered to 2 m by dilution with the addition of trypsin solution. Tryptic digest was conducted overnight at 25 °C in 2 m urea, 10 mm ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.0. Peptides were resolved by reverse-phase chromatography on 0.1 × 300-mm fused silica capillaries (J&W, 100 mm inner diameter) self-filled with porous R2 (Perspective). The peptides were eluted using a 80-min linear gradient of 5 to 95% acetonitrile with 0.1% acetic acid in water at a flow rate of about 1 μl/min. The liquid from the column was electrosprayed into an ion-trap mass spectrometer (LCQ, Finnigan, San Jose, CA). Mass spectrometry was performed in the positive ion mode using repetitively full MS scan followed by collision induced dissociation of the most dominant ion selected from the first MS scan. The mass spectrometry data were compared with simulated proteolysis and collision induced dissociation of the proteins in the NR-NCBI data base using Sequest software (J. Eng and J. Yates, University of Washington and Finnigan, San Jose). Antibodies—Monoclonal mouse antibodies directed at MBP (Novus Biologicals, Inc., Littleton, CO) and polyclonal rabbit antibodies directed at CBD (New England Biolabs) were used for identification of fusion protein harboring the corresponding tags. Secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat antibodies directed against mouse IgG or rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc., West Grove, PA) were used for the Western blot analysis. MALDI-TOF Mass Spectrometry Analysis of Proteins and Peptides— Electroelution from the gel and in-gel digestion, intact molecular weight measurements of proteins and peptide mass mapping of enzymatically cleaved peptides using MALDI-TOF, are as previously described (13Amitai G. Belenkiy O. Dassa B. Shainskaya A. Pietrokovski S. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 47: 61-73Google Scholar). N-terminal Amino Acid Sequencing—Amylose or chitin-purified proteins were subjected to electrophoresis on the Tris glycine buffer system with 10% polyacrylamide gels. Gels were electroblotted to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad) and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 according to the manufacturer's instructions (Hoefer, protein electrophoresis application guide). Polyvinylidene difluoride membranes were then destained with in 40% methanol, 7% acetic acid followed by 90% methanol and 10% acetic acid. Protein bands corresponding to the molecular mass of MIC (88 kDa), MC (50 kDa), and IC (45 kDa) were cut with a clean scalpel from the polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and each subjected to Edman degradation. The data were acquired and analyzed on a Prosize 4.90 data system (Applied Biosystems). C-terminal Autocleavage Rate of CIV Intein—The C-terminal cleavage rate was carried out on CIV-C1A and CIV-C1A/Q339N amylosepurified samples, in 20 mm Tris-Cl, 0.2 m NaCl. Duplicate samples were incubated at 37 °C in three different pH values 6.4, 7.2, and 8.2 for various times and the reaction was terminated by flash freezing the protein samples in liquid nitrogen. Samples were then kept in –70 °C until analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Coomasie-stained gels were scanned with a UMAX 610S scanner and analyzed densitometrically with NIH Image 1.62 software. The only observed bands on the gels were those of the C-terminal cleavage product band (MI) and the precursor (MIC). The MI band in each lane was normalized to the total intensities of the MI plus MIC. The rate constants for cleavage were calculated from the slopes of the pseudo-first order plots of the natural logarithm of 1-MI/(MIC+MI) against time (min) (Supplementary Materials Fig. S3). Sequence Data—The C. hydrogenoformans Z-2901 R1 ribonucleotide reductase gene is present in TIGR data set 246194 contig 2341, which can be identified on the NCBI microbial genomes BLAST page. 2www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sutils/genom_table.cgi. Inteins were tested for protein-splicing activity when overexpressed in Escherichia coli and fused to N- and C-terminal protein tags. The precursor fusion proteins were maltose-binding protein/intein/chitin-binding domain (MIC). Reaction products were examined and the nature of the C-terminal ends of spliced inteins was studied by mass spectrometry. N- and C-terminal amino acids of both inteins were substituted to assess their protein-splicing mechanism (Fig. 2). Protein-splicing of the CIV Intein with a C-terminal Gln— Overexpression of the CIV intein fusion protein in E. coli resulted in protein-splicing of the MIC precursor to MC and I products (Fig. 3). Identity of the putative MC protein band (the ligated exteins) was validated by comparing its apparent Mr to that of a control MC without an intein, by mass spectrometry (Table I), and by Western blot using antibodies against both chitin-binding domain (C) and maltose-binding protein (M) (Supplementary Materials Fig. S2). The I product was observed after purification on both amylose and chitin beads. This phenomenon probably results from aggregation of I with other protein products as supported by gel-filtration chromatography of the wild-type sample (not shown). Mass spectrometry of the putative I band, detected by SDS-PAGE, at the Mr of the CIV intein, showed an intact mass corresponding to the expected mass of the CIV intein (Tables I, II, III). Peptide mass content, following proteolytic cleavage of this protein, as measured by MALDI-TOF, identified this protein as the intein (Supplementary Materials Fig. S1).Table IMALDI-TOF mass spectrometry results of CIV and Chy intein protein-splicing productsProtein[M + H]+ calculated mass[M + H]+ measured massMass accuracyCIV-MIC88321.6988637.250.35%CIV-MI81118.1981221.400.12%CIV-MC50268.3550248.760.03%CIV-IC45486.0045192.320.64%CIV-M43064.8442727.340.06%CIV-I38282.4938311.260.07%Chy-I38539.3938539.490.002% Open table in a new tab Table IIC-terminal peptide massIntein typePeptide coordinatesDigestive enzyme[M + H]+ calculated mass[M + H]+ measured massMass accuracy in PPMCIV wt316-339Trypsin2669.2aMass calculated with the addition of a carboxymethyl group.2669.716193CIV wt313-339Trypsin2983.376aMass calculated with the addition of a carboxymethyl group.2984.074233CIV wt330-339Chymotrypsin1005.521005.57352CIV-C340Stop316-339Trypsin2669.2aMass calculated with the addition of a carboxymethyl group.2669.901262CIV-C340Stop313-339Trypsin2983.376aMass calculated with the addition of a carboxymethyl group.2984.015214CIV-C340Stop330-339Chymotrypsin1005.521005.57352Chy wt334-345Trypsin1395.7161395.69812a Mass calculated with the addition of a carboxymethyl group.

The band corresponding to M was also observed, in smaller quantities, in the control MC fusion protein, expressed without an intein (Fig. 3). Appearance of this band is believed to be at least in part because of premature termination of either translation or transcription (13Amitai G. Belenkiy O. Dassa B. Shainskaya A. Pietrokovski S. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 47: 61-73Google Scholar). Amino Acid Substitution of the CIV Intein N- and C-terminal Residue—To examine the splicing pathway, the activity of mutated CIV intein was tested. Substitution of the CIV intein C-terminal Gln by Asn (CIV-Q339N) still enabled protein-splicing activity (Fig. 3). Protein-splicing yield, measured by the ratio of the ligated MC to the rest of the protein products, shows a 7-fold reduction of the CIV-Q339N mutant compared the wild-type. Substitution of the N-terminal Cys of both the wild-type and CIV-Q339N to Ala (CIV-C1A and CIV-C1A/Q339N) blocked N-terminal cleavage as evidenced by the formation of only a C-terminal junction cleavage product, MI, from the MIC precursor (Fig. 3). The yield of MI produced by the in vivo C-terminal junction cleavage of the CIV-C1A/Q339N was 4-fold lower than that of MI produced by CIV-C1A (Fig. 3, lanes 7 and 8). However, the rate of MI formation from MIC measured in vitro was higher (p = 0.01 at 0.05 confidence level for paired samples t test) for the CIV-C1A/Q339N than for the CIV-C1A mutant in neutral, mild acidic, and basic conditions (Table IV and Supplementary Materials Fig. S3). Substitution of the C-terminal Gln to Ala (CIV-Q339A) blocked C-terminal cleavage of the intein but still allowed N-terminal cleavage as apparent by the large accumulation of IC (Fig. 3, lane 5). CIV-C1A and CIV-Q339A mutants cleavage was prevented at the mutated intein-extein junction points, while allowing the cleavage of the other, wild-type, junction point. Expression of CIV-C340Stop mutant, which does not contain a C-extein, produced MI, I, and M. I and M formation was enhanced by dithiothreitol or NH2OH (not shown).Table IVEffect of CIV intein C-terminal substitutions on initial C-terminal cleavage ratepHCIV intein substitutionCIACIA/Q339N6.40.0016, 0.00200.0036, 0.00457.20.0024, 0.00130.0039, 0.00438.20.00170.0022, 0.0023 Open table in a new tab Analysis of the CIV Intein C Terminus—Inteins with a C-terminal Asn are known to form an imide-ring during protein-splicing. To confirm the presence of such a cyclization analogue product in inteins with a C-terminal Gln both the wild-type and mutant CIV inteins were analyzed by mass spectrometry. The mass of the C-terminal peptide from the spliced CIV intein and from an intein generated by N-terminal junction cleavage of a fusion protein that did not have a C-extein (CIV-C340Stop) were compared with each other. Mass spectrometry data showed no difference between the C-terminal peptide of the CIV wild-type and that of CIV-C340Stop (Table II). These results were obtained for two tryptic and one chymotryptic peptides, for wild-type spliced and native C-terminal inteins. All masses were within 0.7 to 0.05 Da of the mass expected for a peptide with a C-terminal Gln. Because the half-life of a glutarimide ring, if formed, is unknown we wanted to minimize the amount of time elapsed from the moment a C-terminal cleavage event occurred to the time it is analyzed by mass spectrometry. The gradual C-terminal autocleavage of the CIV-C1A and C1A/Q339N mutants provided such a system. The C-terminal peptide masses of the MI fusion protein formed by both of these mutants and the CIV-C340Stop mutant were also analyzed. Results agreed with the previous data obtained with the spliced intein. In both approaches the C-terminal peptide of the intein was detected. However, in all cases, including that of the CIV-C1A/Q339N, no reduction of 18 Da from the expected mass of the C-terminal peptide ending with the Gln residue (Tables I, II, III) was detected. Identification of a C-terminal Asp Intein—A unique intein was identified by sequence data analysis in the large subunit of ribonucleotide reductase (R1) of the hyperthermophilic bacteria C. hydrogenoformans (Chy) (Fig. 4). It is an allele of the CIV intein, present in the same integration point in R1, but not particularly related to it, compared with the other alleles of this integration point (not shown). Sequence comparison to other known inteins shows this intein to have a unique C-terminal Asp and a penultimate Leu. Protein-splicing of the C-terminal Asp Chy Intein—Chy intein fusion protein was overexpressed in E. coli and was shown to protein splice (Fig. 5). Detection of MC and I, confirming Chy intein protein-splicing activity was based on several methods. These included the identification of the MC band by comparison of its Mr to that of a control MC product, from a fusion without an intein, Western blot with antibodies raised against either MBP or CBD tags, and by N-terminal amino acid sequencing data of MC (Supplementary Materials Fig. S2 and Table S1). The band corresponding to the Mr of the Chy intein on SDS-PAGE had the expected intact mass (Table I) and the peptide content (Supplementary Materials Fig. S1) of the Chy intein as evidenced by its mass spectrometry analysis. Other products having the apparent Mr of MI, M, IC, and MIC precursor were also detected by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 5). The C-terminal peptide mass of the Chy intein was also detected by mass spectrometry (Table II) and corresponded to its C-terminal peptide having a C-terminal Asp. Amino Acid Substitutions of the Chy Intein—Both the N- and C-terminal residues of the Chy intein were substituted to evaluate protein-splicing activity and autocleavage of the N- and C-terminal junction points. After in vivo overexpression at 37 °C, proteins were purified on both chitin and amylose beads at 4 °C. To examine the effect of temperature on Chy intein activity its chitin-bound products were incubated for 20 min at 70 °C, before elution from the beads. This temperature is close to the natural environment of the thermophilic bacterium where this intein is present (78 °C) (14Svetlichny V.A. Sokolova T.G. Gerhardt M. Ringpfeil M. Kostrikina N.A. Zavarzin G.A. Syst. Appl. Microbiol. 1991; 14: 254-260Google Scholar) (Fig. 5). C1A mutation blocked protein-splicing and N-terminal cleavage, as expected. A double mutant Chy-C1A/D345A inhibited protein-splicing, and also any other autocleavage processes, as evident by appearance of only the precursor (MIC). Chy intein with the C-terminal substitution to Asn (D345N) did not show any protein-splicing activity (no MC product). However, N-terminal cleavage, as evident by the appearance of IC and M, was observed for all C-terminal mutants, namely Chy-D345A, Chy-D345E, Chy-D345N, and Chy-D345Q. Additionally, a faint protein band with the apparent Mr of the Chy intein (I) appears in protein samples purified by chitin beads. After incubation at 70 °C some of the protein bands are more prominent than others. The protein band corresponding to the I and MI product are more prominent in the wild-type and Chy-C1A mutant, respectively. In contrast the MIC precursor becomes less prominent for both wild-type and the Chy-C1A mutant. In addition the putative intein band seems denser for all Chy C-terminal mutants. This band did not appear in the Chy C1A and C1A/D345A mutants. A second band migrating slightly faster than the su"

Under basal conditions, only a trace amount of LRP1 was caveolae-associated despite the markedly elevated caveolin-1 and caveolae after adipocytic cell differentiation. Upon insulin treatment, the amount of LRP1 associated with caveolae was increased by 4-fold within 10 min, which was blocked completely by pretreatment with wortmannin prior to insulin. The caveolar localization of LRP1 in adipocytes was specific to insulin; treatment with platelet-derived growth factor-bb isoform did not promote but rather decreased caveolar localization of LRP1 below basal levels. The insulin-induced caveolar localization of LRP1 was also observed in 3T3-L1 fibroblasts where translocation of LRP1 from intracellular membranes to the cell surface was absent, suggesting that association of LRP1 with caveolae was achieved, at least in part, through lateral transmigration along the plane of plasma membranes. Immunocytochemistry studies revealed partial co-localization of LRP1 (either endogenous LRP1 or an epitope-tagged minireceptor) with caveolin-1 in cells treated with insulin, which was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation of LRP1 with caveolin-1 in cells treated with insulin but not platelet-derived growth factor-bb.

Mammalian LRP1 is abundantly expressed in hepatocytes, neurons, smooth muscle cells, fibroblasts, and adipocytes. LRP1 is cleaved post-translationally by the endopeptidase furin in the distal Golgi, and the resulting extracellular α-chain (515 kDa) and transmembrane β-chain (85 kDa) form a non-covalent heterodimer (3.Herz J. Kowal R.C. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1769-1776Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). The α-chain is composed of three major structural modules, namely class A ligand-binding (complement-type) repeats, the epidermal growth factor (EGF) precursor-type repeats, and YWTD β-propellers. The ligand-binding repeats are dispersed throughout the LRP1 extracellular domain in four clusters denoted I to IV, of which clusters II and IV possess the ability to bind a variety of structurally unrelated ligands (4.Obermoeller-McCormick L.M.

In addition, the cytoplasmic tail of the LRP1 β-chain also contains amino acid sequences that act as a binding site for adaptor proteins (8.Barnes H. Larsen B. Tyers M. van Der G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19119-19125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Most of the LRP1-interacting proteins contain a protein interaction domain, phosphotyrosine binding domain, or PDZ domain and function in cell adhesion, trafficking, and signal transduction (9.Gotthardt M.

Cell. 1992; 71: 411-421Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar) suggest that LRP1 participates in biological processes other than lipoprotein metabolism. Accumulating experimental data have indicated that LRP1 and some other LDLR family members are located within the lipid raft microdomains of the plasma membrane (20.Riddell D.R. Sun X.M.

Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 199-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (1711) Google Scholar). They are abundant in some terminally differentiated cells such as adipocytes, endothelial cells, and smooth muscle cells. Caveolin-1, a 21-24-kDa protein associated with the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane, is the structural protein component of caveolae that acts as a scaffolding protein to organize and concentrate specific lipids, signaling molecules, and receptor tyrosine kinases, such as insulin receptor, platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR), and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) (27.Anderson R.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 199-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (1711) Google Scholar, 28.Razani B. Schlegel A. Lisanti M.P. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 2103-2109Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Some signaling molecules appear to exist as a tightly associated complex with caveolin-1 (26.Sargiacomo M. Sudol M. Tang Z. Lisanti M.P. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 789-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar, 29.Lisanti M.P. Scherer P.E. Vidugiriene J. Tang Z. Hermanowski-Vosatka A. Tu Y.H. Cook R.F. Sargiacomo M. J.

The apolipoprotein E receptor 2 (apoER2) was the first LDLR family member found in caveolin-enriched membrane fractions (20.Riddell D.R. Sun X.M. Stannard A.K. Soutar A.K. Owen J.S. J. Lipid Res. 2001; 42: 998-1002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This localization of apoER2 to caveolae suggests a signaling role in addition to lipoprotein endocytosis (30.Hiesberger T. Trommsdorff M. Howell B.W. Goffinet A. Mumby M.C. Cooper J.A. Herz J.

The LDLR itself has also been found in lipid rafts in hamster and rat hepatocytes, and this raft association can be enhanced by cholesterol treatment (22.Ness G.C. Kohlruss N. Gertz K.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 303: 177-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). However, the function of raft-associated LDLR remains unclear. LRP1 has also been found in caveolae in fibroblasts, where the cytoplasmic tail of the β-chain can be tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to PDGF-bb (18.Loukinova E. Ranganathan S. Kuznetsov S. Gorlatova N. Migliorini M.M. Loukinov D. Ulery P.G. Mikhailenko I. Lawrence D.A. Strickland D.K. J. Biol.

The tyrosine phosphorylation of LRP1 β-chain can be catalyzed by the non-receptor tyrosine kinase Src, and phosphorylated LRP1 can bind to Shc, an adaptor protein involved in signal transduction (8.Barnes H. Larsen B. Tyers M. van Der G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19119-19125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The potential signaling role of LRP1 has prompted us to determine whether LRP1 is associated with caveolae in adipocytes. In differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes, caveolae account for 20% of the plasma membrane surface area (32.Fan J.Y. Carpentier J.L. van Obberghen E. Grunfeld C. Gorden P. Orci L. J. Cell Sci. 1983; 61: 219-230Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and are evident as single pits as well as clustered “rosette” structures (33.Parton R.G. Molero J.C. Floetenmeyer M. Green K.M. James D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46769-46778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). We found previously that insulin treatment stimulated a rapid translocation of LRP1 from intracellular membranes to the plasma membrane in a phosphatidylinositide (PI) 3-kinase-dependent manner in differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes (34.Ko K.W. Avramoglu R.K. McLeod R.S. Vukmirica J. Yao Z. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 752-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). We hypothesize that the increased cell surface presentation of LRP1 upon insulin stimulation may in part represent caveolae localization. In the present study, we used the detergent solubilization method to isolate caveolae/lipid rafts from both 3T3-L1 fibroblasts and differentiated adipocytes, and we analyzed caveolae localization of LRP1 in response to insulin treatment. Materials—Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) and fetal bovine serum were obtained from Invitrogen. Insulin, 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, wortmannin, and cholera toxin B peroxidase conjugate were obtained from Sigma. Dexamethasone and PDGF-bb were purchased from Steraloids (Wilton, NH) and R & D Systems, respectively. Polyclonal anti-human LRP1 β-chain antisera were generated by using a synthetic polypeptide corresponding to the C-terminal 13 amino acids of LRP1. The polyclonal (C13630) and monoclonal (C37) anti-caveolin-1 antibodies and polyclonal anti-PDGF receptor-β antibody were obtained from BD Transduction Laboratories. The antibodies against GLUT4, transferrin receptor (TfR), and phosphotyrosine (clone 4G10) were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology and Upstate Cell Signaling. The monoclonal anti-hemagglutinin (HA) antibody was obtained from Babco. The goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated with Alexa Fluor™, anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with Alexa Fluor™, and SlowFade Light AntiFade kits were obtained from Molecular Probes. Cell Culture—3T3-L1 mouse fibroblasts (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) were propagated and differentiated into adipocytes as described previously (34.Ko K.W. Avramoglu R.K. McLeod R.S. Vukmirica J. Yao Z. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 752-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes used for all experiments were 6-12 days post-differentiation. Greater than 85% of the cells were differentiated as determined by observation of lipid droplets under light microscope (×10 objective). Insulin, Wortmannin, and PDGF-bb Treatment—The 3T3-L1 fibroblasts and adipocytes were grown in serum-free DMEM containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 16 h prior to experiments. Cells were incubated with serum-free media containing insulin (100 nm) or PDGF-bb (50 ng/ml) for 10 min at 37 °C. In some experiments, cells were treated with wortmannin (100 nm) for 15 min prior to insulin treatment. After washing with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) three times, the cells were subjected to subcellular fractionation or were used for isolation of caveolae fractions. Isolation of Caveolae—Preparation of caveolae fractions was performed as described previously (24.Brown D.A. Rose J.K. Cell. 1992; 68: 533-544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2588) Google Scholar, 26.Sargiacomo M. Sudol M. Tang Z. Lisanti M.P. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 789-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. All steps were carried out at 4 °C. Briefly, 3T3-L1 adipocytes (18 × 106 cells) were washed three times with ice-cold PBS, collected in 2 ml of MES buffer (25 mm MES, pH 6.5, 150 mm NaCl) containing 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm NaF, and protease inhibitor mixture. Cells were homogenized by passing through a chilled ball-bearing homogenizer (20 strokes). The cell homogenates were mixed with Triton X-100 to a final concentration of 1% (v/v), incubated on ice for 30 min, and then added to an equal volume of sucrose solution (80%, w/v; prepared in MES buffer) prior to loading into a 12-ml ultracentrifuge tube (for SW41 rotor, Beckman Instruments). The sample (4 ml) was overlaid with 4 ml of 30% sucrose and 3.6 ml of 5% sucrose (in MES buffer) and centrifuged for 18 h, 39,000 rpm, at 4 °C. After centrifugation, 12 fractions (900 μl each) were collected from the top of the tubes. An equal aliquot of each fraction was resuspended in SDS sample buffer, and proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and detected by immunoblotting with proper antibodies. Subcellular Fractionation—The high density microsomes (HDM) and low density microsomes (LDM) were separated from the plasma membrane (PM) and the nucleus/mitochondrial membranes according to published methods (35.Fisher M.D. Frost S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11806-11809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 36.Simpson I.A. Yver D.R. Hissin P.J. Wardzala L.J. Karnieli E. Salans L.B. Cushman S.W.

Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 752-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The resulting PM, HDM, LDM and nucleus/mitochondria pellet were resuspended in equal amounts of buffer A (250 mm sucrose, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting analysis. Dot Blot—For analysis of GM1, equal amounts of the fractionated samples were dot-blotted onto nitrocellulose membrane and probed with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated cholera toxin B subunit, a ligand for ganglioside GM1 enriched in the plasma membrane of caveolae/lipid rafts (37.Fra A.M. Masserini M. Palestini P. Sonnino S. Simons K. FEBS Lett. 1995; 375: 11-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation—Pooled caveolae fractions were resuspended and lysed in IPB buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm CaCl2) containing 1% Triton X-100, 60 mm octylglucoside, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm NaF, and protease inhibitor mixture. Samples were incubated at room temperature for 0.5 h and at 4 °C for 1 h with constant rocking. Cleared lysates were incubated with the specified antibodies at 4 °C overnight. Protein A-Sepharose beads (40 μl of 0.1 g/ml slurry) were added to the samples and incubated at 4 °C for an additional 2 h. The beads were sedimented by centrifugation and washed once with IPB buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, twice with IPB buffer containing 0.5% Triton X-100, and twice with IPB buffer alone. The immunoprecipitated proteins were eluted using SDS sample buffer, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and detected by immunoblotting. Preparation of Adenovirus Vector and Infection into 3T3-L1 Fibroblasts and Adipocytes—The adenoviral expression plasmid pAdCMV-LRP1-IV was constructed by using the pAdEasy vector system (Q-BIO gene), which encoded the LRP1 signal sequence followed with the N-terminal first 5 amino acids (AIDAP) of the mature LRP1 (GenBank™ accession number X13916), the HA epitope, a 3-amino acid linker (GAP), the entire cluster IV of class A ligand binding repeats, the transmembrane domain, and the cytoplasmic tail. The pAdCMV-LRP1-IV was transfected into HEK-293 cells, and the resulting virus particles were purified by ultracentrifugation in a CsCl gradient. The virus stock was titered with HEK-293 cells, and plaques were counted on day 8. The virus particles were used to infect 3T3-L1 fibroblasts or adipocytes at 100 plaque-forming units/cell. After incubation at 37 °C for 1.5 h with agitation at 15-min intervals, additional serum-free DMEM was added for an overnight incubation. Serum-free medium was changed to complete medium after 24 h of infection. The complete medium was maintained for 24 h and then replaced with serum-free DMEM for 16 h prior to insulin treatment. Immunocytochemistry—The AdCMV-LRP1-IV-infected 3T3-L1 fibroblasts and adipocytes (plated on coverslips) were treated with or without insulin for 10 min at 37 °C. After treatment, cells were washed three times with ice-cold PBS and fixed on ice with 3% paraformaldehyde for 30 min. The cells were washed three times with 100 mm glycine and blocked with 1% BSA for 1 h prior to probing with a monoclonal anti-HA antibody. Cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 5 min on ice. The cells were blocked with 1% BSA for 1 h prior to probing with a polyclonal anti-caveolin-1 antibody followed by incubation with goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated with Alexa Fluor™ 488 and goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with Alexa Fluor™ 594. All solutions were prepared in 1× PBS buffer, and all incubations and washes were performed at 4 °C. After immunostaining, the coverslips were mounted onto a glass slide using SlowFade Light AntiFade. The images were captured using an MRC-1024 laser-scanning confocal imaging system. In some experiments, double immunofluorescence staining was performed with 3T3-L1 fibroblasts to detect endogenous LRP1 and caveolin-1. For this purpose, the paraformaldehyde-fixed cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 and probed with an anti-LRP1 β-chain polyclonal antibody and an anti-caveolin-1 monoclonal antibody. Tandem Mass Spectrometry Analysis of Lipids Composition of Rafts and Non-raft Fractions—Differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes were serum-starved for 16 h and then treated with or without insulin (100 nm), for 10 min. Caveolae fractions were isolated from the cells by the detergent solubilization and sucrose density ultracentrifugation method as described above. Caveolae and non-caveolae membranes were pooled from fractions 4 to 6 and 10 to 12, respectively. Total lipids of the two pooled fractions were extracted using chloroform/methanol/acetic acid/saturated NaCl/H2O (4:2:0.1:1:2 by volume) in the presence of 230 pmol of dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (14:0-14:0) and 110 pmol of dipalmitoylphosphatidylethanolamine (PE) (16:0-16:0) as internal standards. Aliquots of lipid extracts were applied to tandem mass spectrometry, and the molecular species (i.e. fatty acid composition) of choline-containing lipids and PE were determined by daughter ion analysis in the negative ion mode as described previously (38.DeLong C.J.

Chem. 2000; 275: 25023-25030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The integrated area under the peak of each molecular species was quantified by comparing with that of internal standards. Insulin Stimulates LRP1 Association with Caveolae in 3T3-L1 Adipocytes—We (34.Ko K.W. Avramoglu R.K. McLeod R.S. Vukmirica J. Yao Z. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 752-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and others (40.Corvera S. Graver D.F. Smith R.M. J. Biol.

Chem. 1993; 268: 974-981Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) showed previously that insulin acutely stimulated the translocation of LRP1 from an intracellular membrane compartment to the cell surface. In the present study, we characterized further the effect of insulin treatment on LRP1 distribution between PM, HDM, and LDM by immunoblot analysis. Representative blots typical of three independent experiments are shown in Fig. 1. Under basal conditions, ∼21% (± 1.4%, n = 3) of the total LRP1 in 3T3-L1 adipocytes was present in the plasma membrane fraction; 44 (±3.8%) and 14% (±0.3%) were associated with HDM and LDM, respectively, and the remainder 22% (± 1.9%) was found in the combined nucleus/mitochondria fractions (data not shown). Insulin treatment (100 nm, 10 min) increased plasma membrane-associated LRP1 by ∼188% (± 11.6%) of basal, accounting for 43% (± 5.0%) of the total LRP1. The increased LRP1 associated with plasma membrane was accompanied by a marked decrease in LDM-associated LRP1. This result, in agreement with our previous observation (34.Ko K.W. Avramoglu R.K. McLeod R.S. Vukmirica J. Yao Z. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 752-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), confirms translocation of LRP1 from LDM to plasma membrane in 3T3-L1 cells treated with insulin. The abundance of caveolae on the plasma membrane of 3T3-L1 cells (32.Fan J.Y. Carpentier J.L. van Obberghen E. Grunfeld C. Gorden P. Orci L. J.

To this end, we compared the two commonly used protocols for caveolae isolation, namely the detergent solubilization (24.Brown D.A. Rose J.K.

After centrifugation, the protein marker caveolin-1 and the lipid marker ganglioside GM1 of caveolae were found predominantly in low density fractions 4-7 (which were at the interface between 5 and 30% sucrose densities), whereas the non-caveolae protein marker TfR presented at the bottom of the sucrose gradient (i.e. fractions 10-12) (Fig. 2A). Because it has been shown previously that caveolin-1 and GM1 reside predominantly on the plasma membrane (37.Fra A.M. Masserini M. Palestini P. Sonnino S. Simons K. FEBS Lett. 1995; 375: 11-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), the fractions 4-7 of the sucrose gradient most likely represent caveolae domains of plasma membrane origin. A small proportion of caveolin-1 was present in fractions 8-10, which probably represented non-plasma membrane intracellular species (44.Ito J. Nagayasu Y. Yokoyama S. J.

The inner membrane protein Oxa1 plays an important role in this process. Translocation of the terminal intermembrane space domains of subunit 2 of the cytochrome oxidase complex, Cox2, strictly depends on Oxa1. In contrast, other Oxa1 substrates can be inserted independently of Oxa1 function, although at reduced efficiency. A Saccharomyces cerevisiae mutant containing a large deletion in its mitochondrial genome allowed us to analyze the insertion process of a fusion protein of cytochrome b and Cox2. In this mutant, the N-terminal domain of Cox2 is synthesized as a hairpin loop that is flanked by hydrophobic transmembrane segments on both sides. Both genetic and biochemical evidences indicate that translocation of this region across the inner membrane still requires Oxa1 function. Thus, the position of intermembrane space domains within protein sequences does not appear to determine their dependence on the Oxa1 translocase. Our observations rather suggest that the dependence on Oxa1 correlates with the net charge of the domain that has to be translocated across the lipid bilayer.

The vast majority of inner membrane proteins, however, is synthesized in the cytosol and inserted after import into the mitochondria. The inner membrane protein Oxa1 was shown to play an important role in the insertion process of both mitochondrially and nuclear encoded proteins into the inner membrane (1.Hell K. Herrmann J. Pratje E. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 418: 367-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 2.Hell K. Herrmann J.M. Pratje E. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cell. 1997; 8: 1449-1460Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar).Oxa1 belongs to a large protein family with members in mitochondria, bacteria, and chloroplasts (5.Kuhn A. Stuart R. Henry R. Dalbey R.E. Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 510-516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 6.Luirink J. Samuelsson T. de Gier J.W. FEBS Lett. 2001; 501: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 7.Yen M.R. Harley K.T. Tseng Y.H. Saier Jr, M.H. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2001; 204: 223-231Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In all these systems, Oxa1 homologs have been shown to be crucial components of membrane insertion reactions. Although the precise molecular role of this protein family is still not clear, Oxa1 proteins are believed to serve as translocation factors that facilitate the transport of hydrophilic protein domains from one side of the membrane to the other.In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, seven inner membrane proteins are encoded by the mitochondrial genome. At least four of these proteins transiently interact with Oxa1 during membrane integration. These proteins are subunits 1, 2, and 3 of the cytochrome oxidase (Cox) 1The abbreviations used are: Cox, cytochrome oxidase; DHFR, dihydrofolate reductase; 5-FOA, 5-fluoroorotic acid.1The abbreviations used are: Cox, cytochrome oxidase; DHFR, dihydrofolate reductase; 5-FOA, 5-fluoroorotic acid. complex (Cox1, 2, and 3) and cytochrome b of the bc1 complex (3.Hell K. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1281-1288Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Whereas Oxa1 function was shown to be absolutely essential for membrane integration of Cox2, other polypeptides such as Cox1, Cox3, cytochrome b, and subunit 6 of the F0F1-ATPase (Atp6) insert into the inner membrane in the absence of Oxa1, although at reduced levels (3.Hell K. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1281-1288Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). The ability to bypass Oxa1-mediated insertion requires the presence of the inner membrane protein Mba1, a component in a second, Oxa1-independent insertion pathway (8.Preuss M. Leonhard K. Hell K. Stuart R.A. Neupert W. Herrmann J.M. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1085-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 9.Herrmann J.M. Neupert W. IUBMB Life. 2003; 55: 219-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar).The reason for the strict Oxa1 dependence of Cox2 is unclear. Cox2 spans the inner membrane twice and exposes its hydrophilic N and C termini into the intermembrane space. In contrast, the intermembrane space domains of the other mitochondrially encoded substrates of Oxa1 form hairpin loops, i.e. stretches flanked on both sides by transmembrane domains: Cox1, cytochrome b, and the precursor form of Atp6 expose four, six, and three loop domains to the intermembrane space, respectively; Cox3 contains three intermembrane space loops and a C-terminal domain of few hydrophobic residues most likely completely buried in the membrane and therefore not exposed to the intermembrane space (10.Iwata S. Ostermeier C. Ludwig B. Michel H. Nature. 1995; 376: 660-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (1968) Google Scholar, 11.di Rago J.P. Sohm F. Boccia C. Dujardin G. Trumpower B.L. Slonimski P.P. J. Biol.

Des. 2000; 8: 669-684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (508) Google Scholar). Oxa1 might be generally dispensable for the insertion of loop domains but strictly required for the export of terminal sequences explaining why the export of both Cox2 tails is blocked completely when Oxa1 function is compromised (1.Hell K. Herrmann J. Pratje E. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 418: 367-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The so far characterized nuclear encoded Oxa1 substrates likewise contain N termini that have to be exported across the inner membrane.Cox2 is synthesized in the matrix as a precursor protein with an N-terminal extension. This presequence is proteolytically removed by the Imp1 protease in the intermembrane space after translocation across the inner membrane. Translocation of the N-terminal domain of Cox2 was found kinetically to precede export of the C terminus, and conditions that block N tail export also prevent translocation of the C terminus (13.Herrmann J.M. Koll H. Cook R.A. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27079-27086Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The precise function of the presequence of Cox2 is not clear. This presequence tolerates considerable changes in its primary structure, challenging the hypothesis that this region of the protein contains important targeting information (14.Bonnefoy N. Bsat N. Fox T.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2359-2372Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The mRNA sequence that encodes the presequence, however, was shown to be essential for translation of Cox2, and deletion of the presequence-encoding region completely abolished Cox2 synthesis (14.Bonnefoy N. Bsat N. Fox T.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2359-2372Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 15.Torello A.T. Overholtzer M.H. Cameron V.L. Bonnefoy N. Fox T.D. Genetics. 1997; 145: 903-910Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Employing a genetic suppressor screen, Fox and co-workers (14.Bonnefoy N. Bsat N. Fox T.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2359-2372Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 15.Torello A.T. Overholtzer M.H. Cameron V.L. Bonnefoy N. Fox T.D. Genetics. 1997; 145: 903-910Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) isolated a respiratory-competent yeast mutant lacking the presequence of Cox2. This mutant contains two mitochondrial genomes, which are depicted in Fig. 1, B and C: one genome in which the region encoding for the 13 residues of the presequence is missing (cox2–20 genome) and a second genome showing a large deletion (cob::cox2 genome). This large deletion fuses the COB gene for cytochrome b to that of Cox2. This results in a gene product consisting of the N-terminal 252 amino acid residues of cytochrome b and the entire mature part of Cox2. This mutant is able to grow on nonfermentable carbon sources, indicating that a functional Cox2 protein is produced. Here we report on the analysis of the insertion process of the CobCox2 fusion protein into the inner membrane of mitochondria, focusing especially on the relevance of Oxa1 function for its biogenesis. Our observations indicate that the dependence on Oxa1 is not determined primarily by the position of the exported domain within a protein but rather by its nature. We propose that Oxa1 dependence correlates with the charges that have to be translocated.MATERIALS AND METHODSYeast Strains—Yeast strains used in this study were isonuclear to W303-1A (MAT a, leu2, trp1, ura3, ade2). The mitochondrial genomes were derived from that of a D273-10B strain (ATCC 25657). Generation of the temperature-sensitive oxa1ts strain was reported before (3.Hell K. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1281-1288Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). For generation of cob::cox2 strains (NBY275 and NBY276), the wild type mitochondrial genomes in W303-1A and oxa1ts cells were removed by growth on ethidium bromide, and both the cob::cox2 and cox2–60 genomes (Fig. 1, C and D) were introduced by successive cytoduction (16.Bonnefoy N. Fox T.D. Methods Cell Biol. 2001; 65: 381-396Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For expression of Oxa1, the entire OXA1 gene was cloned into a pRS416 (URA3, CEN) expression vector (17.Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Yeast strains were grown in YP medium (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone) supplemented with either 2% glucose (YPD) or 2% ethanol and 2% glycerol (YPEG). For isolation of mitochondria, cells were grown in lactate medium at 30 or 24 °C (for oxa1ts mutant strains) and treated as described previously (18.Herrmann J.M. Fölsch H. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. Celis J.E. Cell Biology: A Laboratory Handbook. 1. Academic Press, San Diego1994: 538-544Google Scholar).Radiolabeling of Mitochondrial Translation Products—Mitochondrial translation products were radiolabeled in isolated mitochondria essentially as described before (19.Westermann B. Herrmann J.M. Neupert W. Methods Cell Biol. 2001; 65: 429-438Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mitochondria (50 μg) were resuspended in 12 μl of labeling buffer (0.6 m sorbitol, 150 mm KCl, 15 mm potassium phosphate, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 12.5 mm MgSO4, 3 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 4 mm ATP, 0.5 mm GTP, 5 mm α-ketoglutarate, 5 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, and 12 μg/ml of all amino acids except methionine). To induce the temperature-sensitive phenotype of oxa1ts strains, mitochondria were incubated for 10 min at 37 °C or kept on ice for control. After an incubation for 2 min at 25 °C, 1 μl of [35S]methionine (10 μCi/μl) was added and the sample incubated further at 25 °C. After labeling, the reaction was diluted in 1 ml of ice-cold washing buffer (0.6 m sorbitol, 80 mm KCl, 20 mm HEPES pH 7.4). Mitochondria were reisolated by centrifugation at 16,000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min, washed again, and lysed in SDS sample buffer (20.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206024) Google Scholar).Immunoprecipitation—For immunoprecipitations (21.Herrmann J.M. Westermann B. Neupert W. Methods Cell Biol. 2001; 65: 217-230Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) mitochondria were lysed in 5 μl of 1% SDS, 20 mm HEPES pH 7.4, vortexed for 5 min, boiled for 30 s, and diluted immediately with 500 μl of ice-cold IP buffer (1% Triton X-100, 300 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4). The extract was cleared by centrifugation at 16,000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min and incubated with antibodies prebound to protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences). After incubation for 2 h at 4 °C the beads were recovered by centrifugation for 5 s at 12,000 × g, washed three times with IP buffer, once in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and resuspended in SDS sample buffer. The antisera used were raised in rabbits against full-length Cox2 purified from yeast or against a C-terminal peptide of Cox2 (13.Herrmann J.M. Koll H. Cook R.A. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27079-27086Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar).Miscellaneous—The following procedures were described before: in vitro transcription/translation of precursor proteins and import of precursor proteins into isolated mitochondria (22.Ryan M.T. Voos W. Pfanner N. Methods Cell Biol. 2001; 65: 189-215Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); enzymatic measurements of Cox activity (23.Tzagoloff A. Akai A. Needleman R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 8228-8235Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); and mitochondrial subfractionation (24.Leonhard K. Herrmann J.M. Stuart R.A. Mannhaupt G. Neupert W. Langer T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4218-4229Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Radiographic signals were quantified by densitometry using a Pharmacia ImageScanner with Image Master 1D Elite software package (Amersham Biosciences).RESULTSThe CobCox2 Fusion Protein Is Synthesized Efficiently and Gives Rise to a Functional Cox2 Protein—Deletion of the presequence-encoding sequence of COX2 (Fig. 1B) abolishes Cox2 synthesis resulting in a respiratory deficient growth phenotype of the mutant. Torello et al. (15.Torello A.T. Overholtzer M.H. Cameron V.L. Bonnefoy N. Fox T.D. Genetics. 1997; 145: 903-910Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) isolated a suppressor of such a mutant harboring an additional truncated mitochondrial genome (Fig. 1C). On this genome, the COB and COX2 genes are fused resulting in a sequence that encodes a chimeric protein consisting of the N-terminal 252 amino acid residues of cytochrome b and residues 14–251 of Cox2 (see Fig. 1, E–G). Expression of this chimera, CobCox2, restored respiratory competence of the strain. To study the biogenesis of this fusion protein, we constructed a yeast strain (NBY275) containing two mitochondrial genomes: the cob::cox2 genome (Fig. 1B), and a genome in which the promoter and start region of the COX2 gene were deleted (cox2–60, Fig. 1D) so that Cox2 is not produced (25.Bonnefoy N. Fox T.D. Mol. Gen. Genet. 2000; 262: 1036-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar).To assess the synthesis of the CobCox2 fusion protein, mitochondrial translation products were radiolabeled in isolated mitochondria by incubation with [35S]methionine, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and visualized by autoradiography (Fig. 2A). Only low amounts of mature Cox2 were found in cob::cox2 mutant mitochondria. Instead the mutant efficiently expressed a protein of an apparent mass of 51 kDa which was absent in the wild type. This was slightly below the calculated size of the CobCox2 fusion (55 kDa), which is most likely because of the fast migration of cytochrome b during electrophoresis (apparent mass, 30 kDa; calculated mass, 43 kDa). To show that the 51-kDa band represents the CobCox2 fusion protein, mitochondria were lysed after the labeling reaction, and Cox2 derivatives were isolated by immunoprecipitation. The 51-kDa band could be isolated with Cox2-specific antibodies verifying that this species represents the CobCox2 protein. The signal of the CobCox2 protein was much stronger than that of the mature Cox2 form. This is in part because of its significantly higher content in methionine residues in the fusion protein (21 versus 6). Despite the inefficient processing of the CobCox2 fusion, Western blotting revealed almost wild type levels of endogenous mature Cox2 in the cob::cox2 mutant (Fig. 2B), explaining its respiratory-competent growth phenotype. Interestingly, no steady-state levels of CobCox2 protein could be detected by Western blotting, suggesting that this form is either completely converted to mature Cox2 over time or degraded. Expression of Cox2 from the cob::cox2 gene resulted in a fully functional Cox2 protein, and the levels of cytochrome oxidase activity reached about 65% of that in wild type mitochondria (Fig. 2C).Fig. 2The CobCox2 fusion protein is expressed and converted into a functional Cox2 protein. A, labeling of CobCox2 in isolated mitochondria. Mitochondrial translation products were radio-labeled in isolated wild type (wt) or cob::cox2 mitochondria (70 μg) for 30 min at 25 °C. Mitochondria were lysed and subjected to SDS-PAGE, either directly (total, T) or after immunoprecipitation with a Cox2-specific antiserum (αCox2). For total lanes, 10% of the reactions were loaded. Positions of molecular mass standards are indicated. B, cob::cox2 mitochondria contain about wild type levels of Cox2. Mitochondrial proteins (100 μg) of wild type or cob::cox2 cells were subjected to Western blotting employing antisera against aconitase (Aco1), D lactate dehydrogenase (Dld1), Cox2, and Mge1. C, cob::cox2 mitochondria contain active cytochrome oxidase. The levels of cytochrome oxidase were measured in mitochondria isolated from wild type, cob::cox2, or Δoxa1 cells. The Δoxa1 mutant served as control for a strain devoid of cytochrome oxidase activity.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Oxa1 Is Required for Respiration in a cob::cox2 Background—Oxa1 is essential for the export of the N terminus of Cox2 across the inner membrane (1.Hell K. Herrmann J. Pratje E. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 418: 367-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). In contrast, insertion of the loop-forming proteins Cox1, Cox3, and cytochrome b bypasses the need for Oxa1 to some extent (3.Hell K. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1281-1288Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). In the CobCox2 fusion protein, the N tail of Cox2 represents a hydrophilic sequence that is flanked on both sides by hydrophobic transmembrane regions. Thus, in principle this Cox2 domain now mimics a hairpin loop structure, and we asked whether Cox2 biogenesis in the cob::cox2 background was still dependent on Oxa1 function. To test this, the cob::cox2 and cox2–60 genomes were transferred into a mutant in which the nuclear copy of OXA1 was deleted and which carried a URA3 plasmid expressing Oxa1. If Oxa1 function was not required for insertion of the CobCox2 fusion protein, the plasmid would be dispensable, and counterselection against the URA3 marker on glycerol medium containing 5-fluoroorotic acid (5-FOA) should result in a respiratory competent strain. As shown in Fig. 3, the OXA1-containing plasmid was essential for growth of the Δoxa1 cob::cox2 strain on nonfermentable carbon sources, because counterselection against the plasmid on 5-FOA did not give rise to any colonies on glycerol (fifth through ninth rows). In contrast, the plasmid was dispensable in a wild type control, resulting in viable colonies on 5-FOA (second row). Thus, the cob::cox2 strain still required Oxa1 function for respiratory competence. This indicates that either the biogenesis of CobCox2 is still Oxa1-dependent or that the function of at least one other mitochondrial protein strictly depends on Oxa1 function.Fig. 3The cob::cox2 mutation does not bypass the requirement of OXA1 for growth on nonfermentable carbon sources. Cultures of the strains indicated were grown to logarithmic phase in liquid medium, and 10-fold dilutions were dropped on YP plates containing either fermentable (2% glucose) or nonfermentable (2% ethanol and 2% glycerol) carbon sources. Plates containing 5-FOA were used to select for uracil auxotroph strains. The first row shows a uracil auxotroph wild type strain that is able to grow on 5-FOA. Transformation of this strain with the OXA1, URA3-containing plasmid still gave rise to growing colonies on 5-FOA glycerol medium because of a partial loss of the plasmid in the progeny (second row). For control, URA3 prototroph wild type cells are shown which cannot lose the URA3 marker (third row). OXA1 is required for growth on nonfermentable carbon sources, and Δoxa1 mutants therefore are unable to grow on glycerol (fourth row). The fifth through the eighth rows show four independent isolates of Δoxa1 cob::cox2 cells harboring the OXA1, URA3-containing plasmid. These mutants were unable to grow on 5-FOA/glycerol, indicating that they require the OXA1 gene to maintain their respiration activity. The last row shows a ura3 auxotroph cob::cox2 mutant for control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)CobCox2 Processing Depends on Oxa1 Function—To assess the Oxa1 dependence of the biogenesis of CobCox2 in more detail, we transferred the cob::cox2 and cox2–60 genomes into a strain harboring a temperature-sensitive oxa1 allele (26.Bauer M. Behrens M. Esser K. Michaelis G. Pratje E. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1994; 245: 272-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). This strain (NBY276) was unable to grow on nonfermentable carbon sources under restrictive conditions, again indicating that the cob::cox2 mutation does not bypass the requirement for Oxa1 function. The oxa1ts allel allows the irreversible inhibition of Oxa1 in isolated mitochondria (1.Hell K. Herrmann J. Pratje E. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 418: 367-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Upon exposure to 37 °C for 10 min the Oxa1-dependent insertion of wild type Cox2 is largely blocked in this mutant, and Cox2 accumulates in its precursor form (Fig. 4A). Whereas in oxa1 deletion mitochondria Cox2 processing is completely abolished (4.He S. Fox T.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1449-1460Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), some maturation still occurs in the oxa1ts mitochondria, most likely because of the residual Oxa1 activity of this mutant.Fig. 4Oxa1 function is required for membrane insertion of the CobCox2 fusion protein. A, Cox2 precursor (pCox2) accumulates in oxa1ts mitochondria. Wild type (OXA1) or oxa1ts mitochondria were preincubated for 10 min at 0 or 37 °C. Samples were adjusted to 25 °C and incubated in the presence of [35S]methionine for 30 min. The Cox2 species synthesized were isolated by immunoprecipitation and visualized by autoradiography. B, wild type (COX2 OXA1), cob::cox2 OXA1, and cob::cox2 oxa1ts mitochondria (300 μg) were converted to mitoplasts by hypotonic swelling. The organelles were reisolated and exposed to 37 °C for 10 min in translation buffer. Then, the temperature was adjusted to 25 °C, and [35S]methionine was added. After radiolabeling for 30 min, the samples were split. One half was mock treated and the other incubated with 100 μg/ml proteinase K for 30 min on ice. After the addition of 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, mitochondria were reisolated, washed, and lysed. The extract was clarified by centrifugation, and Cox2 species were isolated by immunoprecipitation (upper panel). Positions of molecular mass standards are indicated. Swelling of the mitochondria was controlled by Western blotting of the samples with antisera raised against the matrix protein Tim44 or the intermembrane space domain of Dld1. The C-terminal CobCox2 fragment is depicted as f37. To assess the relative amounts of the Cox2 species, one should keep in mind that the CobCox2, f37, and mCox2 forms contain very different numbers of methionine residues, namely 21, 13, and 6, respectively. The signals of unprocessed to Imp1-processed Cox2 species produced in the three mitochondria were quantified, and the proportion of matured protein was calculated under consideration of the different methionine contents of the proteins. C, the topologies of Cox2 and partial and completely inserted CobCox2 are indicated. The pictures are oriented with the matrix side down.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Is Oxa1 function also required for the conversion of CobCox2 into the mature Cox2 form? If the expression of the N-terminal Cox2 domain as a loop-forming structure would bypass the dependence on Oxa1 function, CobCox2 processing should not be affected in the oxa1ts mutant background. To test this, wild type, OXA1 cob::cox2 or oxa1ts cob::cox2 mitochondria were converted to mitoplasts by hypotonic swelling of the outer membrane and incubated for 10 min at 37 °C. Then mitochondrial translation products were radiolabeled. The samples were split; one half was mock treated and the other incubated with proteinase K to digest protein sequences that are exposed to the intermembrane space. The samples were lysed, and the Cox2 species produced were isolated by immunoprecipitation (Fig. 4B). Swelling efficiency and protease protection were controlled by Western blotting with antibodies against the matrix protein Tim44 and the intermembrane space domain of the inner membrane protein Dld1 (Fig. 4B, lower panel). In wild type mitochondria (left panels), Cox2 was almost entirely present in the mature form. Both the N- and the C-terminal domains of this Cox2 species were accessible to proteinase K and, thus, had been efficiently exported into the intermembrane space. In the OXA1 cob::cox2 mitochondria, both the CobCox2 fusion protein and the mature Cox2 protein were found. Quantification of the signals and correction for the very different methionine contents of both forms revealed that 50% of the total Cox2 was present in the matured form. Protease treatment led to a complete degradation of both Cox2 species, indicating that in the presence of functional Oxa1 the fusion protein was efficiently and correctly integrated into the lipid bilayer of the inner membrane. In contrast, when Oxa1 function was compromised in the cob::cox2 oxa1ts mitochondria, strongly reduced amounts of mature Cox2 were generated, indicating an insertion defect of the CobCox2 protein in this mutant. In addition, 30–40% of the unprocessed CobCox2 remained inaccessible for proteinase K and, thus, did not expose any protease-sensitive domains into the intermembrane space (right panel). This number is comparable with the proportion of noninserted cytochrome b protein in oxa1ts mutants (3.Hell K. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1281-1288Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). The residual fraction of CobCox2 was converted to a specific fragment of 37 kDa (f37). This fragment could be isolated with antisera raised against full-length (Fig. 4B) or the very C terminus of Cox2 (not shown). It apparently resulted from proteinase K cleavage in the large hydrophilic loop between transmembrane domains 3 and 4 of the cytochrome b moiety (as depicted in Fig. 4C). Thus, in the absence of functional Oxa1, the Cox2 domain of the fusion protein remained in the matrix. From this we conclude that expression of the N terminus of Cox2 as a hairpin loop did not bypass its dependence on Oxa1 function, explaining why OXA1 remained essential for respiratory competence in the cob::cox2 background.The Nature of Transferred Domains Influences Their Dependence on Oxa1—If not the final topology of a substrate protein, what determines the degree of Oxa1 dependence of an export reaction? It was shown before that the charge of translocated protein domains plays a crucial role in the export process (27.Gavel Y. von Heijne G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 205: 1207-1215Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar); the export reaction becomes more efficient with increasing negative net charge of translocated protein domains (28.Rojo E.E. Guiard B. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19617-19622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Both the N and the C termini of Cox2 are of highly acidic nature and contain a large number of negative charges. Therefore we asked whether charges in a transferred domain influence the dependence of the export reaction on Oxa1. For this we employed mutants of the nuclear encoded Oxa1 substrate subunit 9 (2.Hell K. Herrmann J.M. Pratje E. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2250-2255Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google"
https://openalex.org/W2013546240,"We report here the cloning and initial characterization of a novel growth-related gene (EEG-1) that is located on the short arm of chromosome 12. Two spliced transcripts were cloned from human bone marrow and human erythroid progenitor cells: EEG-1L containing a 4350-nucleotide open reading frame encoding a putative protein of 1077 amino acids including a C1q-like globular domain, and an alternatively spliced transcript lacking exon 5 (EEG-1S) encodes a significantly smaller coding region and no C1q-like domain. Quantitative PCR revealed expression of both EEG-1 transcripts in all analyzed tissues. Plasmids encoding green fluorescent protein-tagged genes (GFP-EEG-1) were transfected into Chinese hamster ovary cells for localization and functional assays. In contrast to the diffuse cellular localization of the GFP control, GFP-EEG-1L was detected throughout the cytoplasm and excluded from the nucleus, and GFP-EEG-1S co-localized with aggregated mitochondria. Transfection of both isoforms was associated with significantly increased levels of apoptosis. Stable transfection assays additionally demonstrated decreased growth in those cells expressing EEG-1 at higher levels. Quantitative PCR analyses of mRNA obtained from differentiating erythroid cells from blood donors were performed to determine the transcriptional pattern of EEG-1 during erythropoiesis. EEG-1 expression was highly regulated with increased expression at the stage of differentiation associated with the onset of global nuclear condensation and reduced cell proliferation. We propose that the regulated expression of EEG-1 is involved in the orchestrated regulation of growth that occurs as erythroblasts shift from a highly proliferative state toward their terminal phase of differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2135538727,"The predicted TM10 transmembrane sequence, 4844IIFDITFFFFVIVILLAIIQGLII4867, has been proposed to be the pore inner helix of the ryanodine receptor (RyR) and to play a crucial role in channel activation and gating, as with the inner helix of bacterial potassium channels. However, experimental evidence for the involvement of the TM10 sequence in RyR channel activation and gating is lacking. In the present study, we have systematically investigated the effects of mutations of each residue within the 24-amino acid TM10 sequence of the mouse cardiac ryanodine receptor (RyR2) on channel activation by caffeine and Ca2+. Intracellular Ca2+ release measurements in human embryonic kidney 293 cells expressing the RyR2 wild type and TM10 mutants revealed that several mutations in the TM10 sequence either abolished caffeine response or markedly reduced the sensitivity of the RyR2 channel to activation by caffeine. By assessing the Ca2+ dependence of [3H]ryanodine binding to RyR2 wild type and TM10 mutants we also found that mutations in the TM10 sequence altered the sensitivity of the channel to activation by Ca2+ and enhanced the basal activity of [3H]ryanodine binding. Furthermore, single I4862A mutant channels exhibited considerable channel openings and altered gating at very low concentrations of Ca2+. Our data indicate that the TM10 sequence constitutes an essential determinant for channel activation and gating, in keeping with the proposed role of TM10 as an inner helix of RyR. Our results also shed insight into the orientation of the TM10 helix within the RyR channel pore. The predicted TM10 transmembrane sequence, 4844IIFDITFFFFVIVILLAIIQGLII4867, has been proposed to be the pore inner helix of the ryanodine receptor (RyR) and to play a crucial role in channel activation and gating, as with the inner helix of bacterial potassium channels. However, experimental evidence for the involvement of the TM10 sequence in RyR channel activation and gating is lacking. In the present study, we have systematically investigated the effects of mutations of each residue within the 24-amino acid TM10 sequence of the mouse cardiac ryanodine receptor (RyR2) on channel activation by caffeine and Ca2+.

Our results also shed insight into the orientation of the TM10 helix within the RyR channel pore. Muscle contraction is initiated by the release of Ca2+ from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. In cardiac muscle, it is believed that sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ release is triggered by Ca2+ influx via a mechanism known as Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release (1Endo M. Physiol. Rev. 1977; 57: 71-108Google Scholar, 2Fabiato A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1985; 85: 247-289Google Scholar, 3Ebashi S. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1991; 53: 1-16Google Scholar, 4Bers D.M. Nature. 2002; 415: 198-205Google Scholar). Specifically, the voltage-gated Ca2+ channel or dihydropyridine receptor located in the transverse tubular membrane opens upon membrane depolarization. The resulting Ca2+ entry through the dihydropyridine receptor activates the cardiac Ca2+ release channel (ryanodine receptor (RyR) 1The abbreviations used are: RyRryanodine receptorCHAPS3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acidHEKhuman embryonic kidneyTMtransmembranewtwild type. 2) located in the sarcoplasmic reticulum, leading to a large Ca2+ release and, subsequently, muscle contraction. Activation of RyR2 by Ca2+ is therefore an essential step in the process of excitation-contraction coupling in heart muscle, and alterations in Ca2+ activation of RyR2 have been implicated in diseases, including heart failure and arrhythmias (5Marks A. Priori S. Memmi M. Kontula K. Laitinen P. J. Cell. Physiol. 2002; 190: 1-6Google Scholar, 6Bers D.M. Circ. Res. 2002; 90: 14-17Google Scholar, 7Scoote M. Williams A. Cardiovasc. Res. 2002; 56: 359-372Google Scholar). Despite its physiological importance, the molecular mechanism of Ca2+ activation of RyR remains poorly understood. ryanodine receptor 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid human embryonic kidney transmembrane wild type. Activation of RyR by Ca2+ is likely to be mediated by the binding of Ca2+ ions to high affinity Ca2+ binding sites in the channel protein (8Meissner G. Darling E. Eveleth J. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 236-244Google Scholar, 9Meissner G. Rios E. Tripathy A. Pasek D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1628-1638Google Scholar), but the locations of these Ca2+ activation sites in the RyR sequence are unknown. Structure-function studies of RyR have provided important information about the molecular determinants of Ca2+ activation. Expression of an NH2-terminally truncated RyR containing the last ∼1,000 COOH-terminal amino acid residues in Chinese hamster ovary cells yielded a Ca2+-activated Ca2+ release channel, indicting that the Ca2+ sensor of RyR resides within the last ∼1,000 amino acid residues (10Bhat M.B. Zhao J. Takeshima H. Ma J. Biophys. J. 1997; 73: 1329-1336Google Scholar). Within this region, several EF-hand-like Ca2+ binding sites have been identified, although their significance in RyR function has yet to be demonstrated (11Chen S.R. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22698-22704Google Scholar, 12Xiong H. Feng X. Gao L. Xu L. Pasek D. Seok J. Meissner G. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4804-4814Google Scholar). Furthermore, deletion of residues 4,274–4,535 increased the sensitivity of RyR1 to activation by caffeine and Ca2+, indicating that this region is unlikely to contain the Ca2+ activation sites (13Du G.G. Khanna V.K. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11778-11783Google Scholar). We have demonstrated recently that a single point mutation, E3987A in RyR2 (14Li P. Chen S.R. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 118: 33-44Google Scholar) and E3885A in RyR3 (15Chen S.R. Ebisawa K. Li X. Zhang L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14675-14678Google Scholar), reduces the sensitivity of the RyR channel to Ca2+ activation by 1,000–10,000-fold. Moreover, coexpression of the RyR2 or RyR3 wild type (wt) and the corresponding Ca2+-sensing mutant proteins produces single individual channels that exhibit intermediate sensitivity to Ca2+ activation. These observations have led us to propose that the Glu3987 residue in RyR2 and the Glu3885 residue in RyR3 constitute an essential determinant of Ca2+ activation (14Li P. Chen S.R. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 118: 33-44Google Scholar, 15Chen S.R. Ebisawa K. Li X. Zhang L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14675-14678Google Scholar). In addition to these identified residues, other determinants of Ca2+ activation probably exist particularly in the channel pore region of RyR because the signal or conformational changes resulting from the binding of Ca2+ ions to the activation sites must be transduced into the pore region to open the channel. However, the exact signal transduction mechanism for Ca2+ activation is currently unknown because of, in part, the lack of detailed structural information about the RyR channel pore. Sequence analysis and functional expression studies have suggested that the ion conduction pore of RyR is located in the COOH-terminal region (10Bhat M.B. Zhao J. Takeshima H. Ma J. Biophys. J. 1997; 73: 1329-1336Google Scholar, 16Takeshima H. Nishimura S. Matsumoto T. Ishida H. Kangawa K. Minamino N. Matsuo H. Ueda M. Hanaoka M. Hirose T. Nature. 1989; 339: 439-445Google Scholar, 17Zorzato F. Fujii J. Otsu K. Phillips M. Green N.M. Lai F.A. Meissner G. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2244-2256Google Scholar). Recent site-directed mutagenesis studies have revealed further insights into the location of the conduction pathway of RyR. We have shown that a single substitution of alanine for glycine at position 4824 in the mouse RyR2 decreases the single channel conductance by 97% (18Zhao M. Li P. Li X. Zhang L. Winkfein R.J. Chen S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25971-25974Google Scholar). The Gly4824 residue is located in a highly conserved luminal loop linking the predicted transmembrane helices TM8 and TM10 (17Zorzato F. Fujii J. Otsu K. Phillips M. Green N.M. Lai F.A. Meissner G. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2244-2256Google Scholar) or TM3 and TM4 according to the transmembrane topology model of Takeshima et al. (16Takeshima H. Nishimura S. Matsumoto T. Ishida H. Kangawa K. Minamino N. Matsuo H. Ueda M. Hanaoka M. Hirose T. Nature. 1989; 339: 439-445Google Scholar). Mutations in the corresponding luminal loop of RyR1 and in rabbit RyR2 have also been shown to alter channel conduction (19Gao L. Balshaw D. Xu L. Tripathy A. Xin C. Meissner G. Biophys. J. 2000; 79: 828-840Google Scholar, 20Du G.G. Guo X. Khanna V.K. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31760-31771Google Scholar). These observations have led to the suggestion that TM8, TM10, and the loop linking these two transmembrane helices form a major part of the RyR channel pore. The predicted secondary structure of this putative pore-forming region of RyR shares a high degree of similarity with that of the bacterial potassium channel KcsA, whose three-dimensional structure has been resolved (21Doyle D.A. Morais Cabral J. Pfuetzner R.A. Kuo A. Gulbis J.M. Cohen S.L. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Norris A. Geddes D.M. Williams A.J. Science. 1998; 280: 69-77Google Scholar). The crystal structure of both the Ca2+- and voltage-gated bacterial potassium channels have also been determined (22Jiang Y. Lee A. Chen J. Cadene M. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Nature. 2002; 417: 523-526Google Scholar, 23Jiang Y. Lee A. Chen J. Cadene M. Chait B. MacKinnon R. Nature. 2002; 417: 515-522Google Scholar, 24Jiang Y. Lee A. Chen J. Ruta V. Cadene M. Chait B. MacKinnon R. Nature. 2003; 423: 33-41Google Scholar), and a comparison of these three-dimensional structures shows an almost identical pore architecture among both the ligand- and voltage-gated bacterial potassium channels. Based on sequence analysis and mutational studies, Williams et al. (25Williams A.J. West D.J. Sitsapesan R. Q. Rev. Biophys. 2001; 34: 61-104Google Scholar) have suggested that the RyR pore may share a basic common architecture with that of potassium channels, and they proposed a structural model for the pore-forming region of RyR using the three-dimensional pore structure of KcsA as a framework. In this hypothetical model, the TM8 and TM10 sequences are thought to correspond, respectively, to the outer and inner helices of the KcsA pore, whereas the luminal loop linking TM8 and TM10 contain motifs equivalent to the pore helix and selectivity filter of KcsA. Comparative analysis of the three-dimensional structures of closed and opened potassium channels reveals that the inner helices are involved in coupling the conformational changes in the gating domain to channel opening via a gating hinge located near the middle of the inner helix (22Jiang Y. Lee A. Chen J. Cadene M. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Nature. 2002; 417: 523-526Google Scholar). This structural feature is apparently conserved among a wide range of ligandand voltage-gated potassium channels (22Jiang Y. Lee A. Chen J. Cadene M. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Nature. 2002; 417: 523-526Google Scholar, 23Jiang Y. Lee A. Chen J. Cadene M. Chait B. MacKinnon R. Nature. 2002; 417: 515-522Google Scholar, 24Jiang Y. Lee A. Chen J. Ruta V. Cadene M. Chait B. MacKinnon R. Nature. 2003; 423: 33-41Google Scholar). On the basis of these findings and the proposed pore model of RyR, it is anticipated that the putative inner helix of the RyR channel pore, TM10, would be involved in channel activation and gating. In line with this hypothesis, we have recently shown that the TM10 sequence contains an important determinant for ryanodine interaction (26Wang R. Zhang L. Bolstad J. Diao N. Brown C. Ruest L. Welch W. Williams A.J. Chen S.R.W. J. Biol. Chem. Octoer 13, 2003; (10.1074/jbc.M306788200)Google Scholar) and that ryanodine is able to sensitize the RyR channel to Ca2+ activation (27Masumiya H. Li P. Zhang L. Chen S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39727-39735Google Scholar), suggesting the involvement of TM10 in Ca2+ activation. To test this hypothesis directly, we have mutated each residue in the TM10 sequence and systematically characterized the effects of these mutations on channel activation by caffeine or by Ca2+. These studies demonstrate that mutations in the TM10 sequence can alter the sensitivity of the channel to activation by caffeine and Ca2+, the basal channel activity, and the gating properties, indicating that the TM10 sequence plays an important role in RyR channel activation and gating. Materials—[3H]Ryanodine was obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Ryanodine was purchased from Calbiochem. Brain phosphatidylserine, heart phosphatidylethanolamine, and plant phosphatidylcholine were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipid. CHAPS, caffeine, and other reagents were purchased from Sigma. Site-directed Mutagenesis and DNA Transfection—Single point mutations within the proposed TM10 transmembrane sequence of the mouse RyR2 were generated by the overlap extension method as described previously (26Wang R. Zhang L. Bolstad J. Diao N. Brown C. Ruest L. Welch W. Williams A.J. Chen S.R.W. J. Biol. Chem. Octoer 13, 2003; (10.1074/jbc.M306788200)Google Scholar). HEK293 cells grown on 100-mm tissue culture dishes in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, supplemented with 0.1 mm nonessential amino acids, 4 mml-glutamine, 100 units of penicillin/ml, 100 μg of streptomycin/ml, 4.5 g of glucose/liter, and 10% fetal calf serum, for 18–20 h after subcultures were transfected with 12 μg of wt or mutant RyR2 cDNA using the method of Ca2+ phosphate precipitation (28Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 16.30-16.73Google Scholar). Ca2+Release Measurements in Transfected HEK293 Cells—Free cytosolic Ca2+ concentration in transfected HEK293 cells was measured using the fluorescence Ca2+ indicator dye fluo 3-AM as described previously (14Li P. Chen S.R. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 118: 33-44Google Scholar) with some modifications. Cells grown for ∼18 h after transfection were washed five times with phosphate-buffered saline (137 mm NaCl, 8 mm Na2HPO4, 1.5 mm KH2PO4, 2.7 mm KCl) and incubated in KRH buffer without MgCl2 or CaCl2 (KRH buffer: 125 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 6 mm glucose, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, and 25 mm Hepes (pH 7.4) at room temperature for 45 min with gentle shaking and then at 37 °C for 45 min. After being detached from culture dishes by gentle pipetting, cells were collected by centrifugation at 1,000 rpm for 5 min in a Thermo/EC Centra CL2 centrifuge. Cell pellets were resuspended in supplemented Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and loaded with 10 μm fluo 3-AM at room temperature for 1 h. The fluo 3-loaded cells were washed with KRH buffer three times and resuspended in KRH buffer plus 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and 250 μm sulfinpyrazone. An aliquot of fluo 3-loaded cells was then added to 2 ml (final volume) KRH buffer in a cuvette, and the fluorescence intensity of fluo 3 before and after sequential additions of various concentrations of caffeine or after a single addition of caffeine with various concentrations was monitored at 530 nm in an SLM-Aminco series 2 luminescence spectrometer with 480 nm excitation at 25 °C. [3H]Ryanodine Binding—Equilibrium [3H]ryanodine binding to cell lysates was performed as described previously (14Li P. Chen S.R. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 118: 33-44Google Scholar) with some modifications. [3H]Ryanodine binding was carried out in a total volume of 300 μl of binding solution containing 30 μl of cell lysate, 500 mm KCl, 25 mm Tris, 50 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), a wide range of Ca2+ concentrations or various channel modulators as indicated, 5 nm [3H]ryanodine, and a protease inhibitor mix at 37 °C for 2–3 h. The binding mix was diluted with 5 ml of ice-cold washing buffer containing 25 mm Tris, pH 8.0, and 250 mm KCl and immediately filtered through Whatman GF/B filters presoaked with 1% polyethylenimine. The filters were washed, and the radioactivities associated with the filters were determined by liquid scintillation counting. Nonspecific binding was determined by measuring [3H]ryanodine binding in the presence of 20 μm unlabeled ryanodine. All binding assays were done in duplicate. Single Channel Recordings—Recombinant RyR2 wt and the I4862A mutant proteins were partially purified from whole cell lysate by sucrose density gradient centrifugation and used for single channel recordings as described previously (14Li P. Chen S.R. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 118: 33-44Google Scholar). Effect of Mutations in the TM10 Sequence on the Response of RyR2 to Activation by Caffeine—To investigate the role of the proposed pore inner helix, TM10, in RyR channel activation, we have mutated each amino acid residue within the TM10 sequence to either alanine or glycine, the latter only in the case of the single alanine residue, Ala4860. A total of 24 TM10 mutants were generated. We have shown that all of the TM10 mutants were expressed in HEK293 cells and that their levels of expression were comparable with that of the wt (26Wang R. Zhang L. Bolstad J. Diao N. Brown C. Ruest L. Welch W. Williams A.J. Chen S.R.W. J. Biol. Chem. Octoer 13, 2003; (10.1074/jbc.M306788200)Google Scholar). To screen the impact of this large number of mutations on channel activation quickly, we employed a simple and quick Ca2+ release assay based on the use of the HEK293 cell expression system and using caffeine as a functional probe. Caffeine is the most widely used activator of RyRs and is believed to stimulate RyR activity by enhancing Ca2+ activation (9Meissner G. Rios E. Tripathy A. Pasek D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1628-1638Google Scholar). In this assay, we monitored the level of intracellular Ca2+ release induced by sequential additions of increasing concentrations of caffeine in HEK293 cells transfected with wt cDNA or the TM10 mutants cDNA using the fluorescence Ca2+ indicator, fluo 3-AM. As shown in Fig. 1Aa, the level of intracellular Ca2+ release in HEK293 cells transfected with RyR2 wt was hardly detected after the first addition of caffeine (0.025 mm). The second addition of caffeine (0.05 mm) induced a clearly detectable level of Ca2+ release, suggesting that the threshold for activation of the wt RyR2 channel by caffeine is ∼0.05 mm. A considerable amount of Ca2+ release was detected after the third to sixth additions of caffeine (0.1, 0.25, 0.5, and 1.0 mm, respectively). The level of Ca2+ release increased progressively with each consecutive addition of caffeine from 0.05 mm up to 1.0 mm and then decreased with further additions of caffeine (2.5 and 5 mm). The reduced level of Ca2+ release seen after the additions of 2.5 and 5.0 mm caffeine, compared with that seen after the addition of 1.0 mm caffeine, is likely the result of the depletion of the intracellular Ca2+ stores by the previous additions of caffeine (0.025–1.0 mm). The responses to this repeated caffeine stimulation of HEK293 cells expressing each TM10 mutant are shown in Figs. 1 and 2. Based on the patterns of their caffeine responses, the TM10 mutants can be grouped into four classes. The first class includes I4844A[1], I4845A[2], F4846A[3], I4848A[5], T4849A[6], I4857A[14], I4861A[18], G4864A[21], and L4865A[22]. HEK293 cells expressing these mutants displayed a pattern of response to repeated caffeine stimulation (from 0.025 to 5 mm) nearly identical to that seen in HEK293 cells expressing RyR2 wt (Fig. 1A, b–j). Thus, these mutations did not apparently alter channel activation by caffeine. The second class of TM10 mutants contains V4856A[13], I4862A[19], and I4867A[24]. HEK293 cells expressing these mutants exhibited a markedly reduced level of intracellular Ca2+ release at all caffeine concentrations (0.025–5.0 mm) (Fig. 1B). Despite this reduced level, intracellular Ca2+ release was consistently detected at low concentrations of caffeine (from 0.05 to 0.1 mm), indicating that these mutants remain highly sensitive to caffeine activation. This suggests that the reduced level of intracellular Ca2+ release seen in these mutants probably results from altered channel gating, which could lead to either uncontrolled openings of the channel and, consequently, a reduced intracellular Ca2+ store or partial openings of the channel. F4851A[8], F4852A[9], F4853A[10], V4854A[11], I4855A[12], A4860G[17], and Q4863A[20] belong to the third class of TM10 mutants. These mutants showed a pattern of response to repeated caffeine stimulation quite different from that observed with RyR2 wt. As seen in Fig. 2Aa, HEK293 cells expressing RyR2 wt were considerably activated by the first addition of 0.25 mm caffeine, and the level of Ca2+ release generated by the first addition of caffeine (0.25 mm) was comparable with that detected with the second and the third additions of caffeine (0.5 and 1.0 mm, respectively). In contrast, the amount of Ca2+ release induced by the first and second additions of caffeine (0.25 and 0.5 mm, respectively) to HEK293 cells expressing these mutants was lower than that observed with the third (1.0 mm) or subsequent additions (2.5 or 5.0 mm) of caffeine, indicating that these mutants require higher concentrations of caffeine for maximal activation than RyR2 wt. On the other hand, using the same set of caffeine concentrations (from 0.25 to 10 mm) (Fig. 2A), the response of the first class of TM10 mutants to repeated caffeine stimulation was indistinguishable from that of RyR2 wt (not shown), which is consistent with the data shown in Fig. 1A. The fourth class of TM10 mutants includes D4847A[4], F4850A[7], L4858A[15], L4859A[16], and I4866A[23]. HEK293 cells expressing these mutants displayed no or little Ca2+ release in response to stimulation by various concentrations of caffeine (Fig. 2B). These mutations apparently have a severe impact on channel activation. Because all TM10 mutants were expressed in HEK293 cells at a comparable level, the reduced level or lack of caffeine-induced Ca2+ release in the second and fourth classes of TM10 mutants was not the result of poor expression. Mutations in the TM10 Sequence Reduce the Sensitivity of RyR2 to Activation by Caffeine—To assess quantitatively the effect of the TM10 mutations on caffeine activation of RyR2, we determined the sensitivity of the TM10 mutants to activation by caffeine. In the light of the results of our initial screening (Figs. 1 and 2), we focused on the third class of TM10 mutants that appeared to have reduced caffeine sensitivity. HEK293 cells were transfected with each of the third class of the TM10 mutants. The transfected cells expressing the same mutant were pooled from multiple plates and aliquoted. The levels of intracellular Ca2+ release from each aliquot of transfected cells were then determined after a single addition of different concentrations of caffeine. Fig. 3 shows examples of individual Ca2+ release events in HEK293 cells expressing RyR2 wt (Fig. 3Aa) and F4852A[9] (Fig. 3Ab), induced by a single dose of caffeine of various concentrations. The peak values of caffeine-induced Ca2+ release were then used to generate the caffeine activation curves for RyR2 wt and each of the class III TM10 mutants. As shown in Fig. 3B, the sensitivity of all the class III TM10 mutants, in particular mutants F4851A[8)], F4852A[9], I4855A[12], and A4860G[17], to caffeine activation was reduced compared with that of the wt, consistent with the observations seen in Fig. 2. Analyses of the concentration dependence of caffeine activation using the Hill equation yielded the apparent EC50 values for caffeine activation of 0.30 ± 0.02 mm (n = 3) for RyR2 wt, 5.10 ± 0.23 mm (n = 4) for F4851A[8], 1.25 ± 0.08 mm (n = 3) for F4852A[9], 0.55 ± 0.06 mm (n = 3) for F4853A[10], 0.79 ± 0.28 mm (n = 4) for V4854A[11], 2.40 ± 0.10 mm (n = 3) for I4855A[12], 1.75 ± 0.47 mm (n = 4) for A4860G[17], and 0.56 ± 0.20 mm (n = 4) for Q4863A[20] (inset in Fig. 3B). Taken together, these data indicate that mutations within the proposed TM10 pore inner helix markedly alter channel activation by caffeine. Effects of the TM10 Mutations on the Sensitivity of RyR2 to Activation by Ca2+—Because caffeine activates RyR by sensitizing the channel to Ca2+ activation (9Meissner G. Rios E. Tripathy A. Pasek D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1628-1638Google Scholar), and mutations that alter Ca2+ activation can in turn affect caffeine activation (14Li P. Chen S.R. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 118: 33-44Google Scholar), the observed changes in caffeine response suggest that the TM10 mutations may also alter Ca2+ activation. To test this possibility directly, we examined the response of the TM10 mutants to Ca2+ activation using [3H]ryanodine binding. [3H]Ryanodine binding has been used widely to assess RyR channel activities because ryanodine has access to its binding site only when the channel is in the open state (29Chu A. Diaz-Munoz M. Hawkes M.J. Brush K. Hamilton S.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 1990; 37: 735-741Google Scholar, 30Meissner G. el-Hashem A. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1992; 114: 119-123Google Scholar, 31Tanna B. Welch W. Ruest L. Sutko J.L. Williams A.J. J. Gen. Physiol. 1998; 112: 55-69Google Scholar). We have shown previously that about half of the 24 mutations made within the TM10 sequence severely curtailed or abolished [3H]ryanodine binding (26Wang R. Zhang L. Bolstad J. Diao N. Brown C. Ruest L. Welch W. Williams A.J. Chen S.R.W. J. Biol. Chem. Octoer 13, 2003; (10.1074/jbc.M306788200)Google Scholar). Hence the Ca2+ response of these mutants could not be assessed using the [3H]ryanodine binding assay. On the other hand, 13 of the 24 TM10 mutants exhibited a considerable amount of [3H]ryanodine binding. Subsequently, the Ca2+ response of these mutants was determined by measuring the amount of bound [3H]ryanodine at a wide range of Ca2+ concentrations. Analysis of the Ca2+ response using the Hill equation yielded an EC50 value of 0.18 ± 0.02 μm (n = 4) for Ca2+ activation of RyR2 wt (Fig. 4A). Both increased and decreased EC50 values for Ca2+ activation were observed among the TM10 mutants. For instance, the V4854A[11] mutation substantially increased the EC50 value for Ca2+ activation to 0.75 ± 0.03 μm (n = 4), whereas the I4862A[19] mutation considerably reduced the EC50 value to 0.09 ± 0.02 μm (n = 5). Thus, mutations in the TM10 sequence can influence the sensitivity of the channel to Ca2+ activation. The EC50 values for other TM10 mutants were 0.62 ± 0.09 μm (n = 4) for I4844A[1], 0.24 ± 0.05 μm (n = 3) for I4845A[2], 0.48 ± 0.18 μm (n = 3) for I4848A[5], 0.43 ± 0.01 μm (n = 3) for F4852A[9], 0.39 ± 0.10 μm (n = 4) for F4853A[10], 0.14 ± 0.03 μm (n = 4) for I4857A[14], 0.34 ± 0.03 μm (n = 3) for A4860G[17], 0.40 ± 0.12 μm (n = 4) for I4861A[18], 0.13 ± 0.02 μm (n = 5) for G4864A[21], 0.22 ± 0.02 μm (n = 3) for L4865A[22], and 0.42 ± 0.03 μm (n = 3) for I4867A[24]. The Bmax values for RyR2 wt and the TM10 mutants were 0.63 ± 0.29 pmol/mg (n = 4) for RyR2 wt, 0.28 ± 0.17 pmol/mg (n = 4) for I4844A[1], 0.29 ± 0.13 pmol/mg (n = 3) for I4845A[2], 0.40 ± 0.10 pmol/mg (n = 3) for I4848A[5], 0.41 ± 0.04 pmol/mg (n = 3) for F4852A[9], 0.56 ± 0.10 pmol/mg (n = 4) for F4853A[10], 0.12 ± 0.04 pmol/mg (n = 4) for V4854A[11], 0.33 ± 0.06 pmol/mg (n = 4) for I4857A[14], 0.27 ± 0.12 pmol/mg (n = 3) for A4860G[17], 0.23 ± 0.05 pmol/mg (n = 4) for I4861A[18], 0.24 ± 0.04 pmol/mg (n = 5) for I4862A[19], 0.52 ± 0.13 pmol/mg (n = 5) for G4864A[21], 0.35 ± 0.07 pmol/mg (n = 3) for L4865A[22], and 0.23 ± 0.06 pmol/mg (n = 3) for I4867A[24]. Mutations in the TM10 Sequence Enhance the Basal Activity of [3H]Ryanodine Binding to RyR2—In addition to alterations in Ca2+ sensitivity, Fig. 4 also shows that mutations in TM10 can induce considerable [3H]ryanodine binding to RyR2 at very low Ca2+ concentrations. At Ca2+ concentrations between 0.1 and 10 nm, 11.2 ± 1.9% (n = 4), 33.1 ± 8.7% (n = 5), and 11.5 ± 2.6% (n = 5) of maximal binding were observed in the I4857A[14], I4862A[19], and G4864A[21] mutants, respectively, whereas ∼5% of maximal binding was detected in wt. This enhanced basal activity of [3H]ryanodine binding is unlikely to result from nonspecific [3H]ryanodine binding, as the basal activity was modulated by various ligands. As shown in Fig. 5, the basal [3H]ryanodine binding activity of the I4862A[19] mutant at ∼3 nm Ca2+ was inhibited by Mg2+ and ruthenium red and was activated by Ca2+, ATP, and caffeine. Furthermore, the response of the I4862A[19] mutant to different modulators at this Ca2+ concentration was similar to that observed at a higher concentration of Ca2+ (∼43 nm). Because [3H]ryanodine binding reflects channel activity, the enhanced specific basal [3H]ryanodine binding to some of the TM10 mutants suggests that mutations in the TM10 sequence can lead to channel openings at very low concentrations of Ca2+, probably by destabilizing the closed state of the channel. Single Channel Properties of the I4862A[19] Mutant at Low Ca2+Concentrations—To examine directly the possibility that the I4862A[19] mutation alters channel gating, we incorporated single wt and I4862A[19] mutant channels into planar lipid bilayers and assessed their channel properties at low Ca2+ concentrations. As shown in Fig. 6A, a single wt channel displayed very little channel activity at ∼45 nm Ca2+. The average open probability (Po), mean open time (To), and mean closed time (Tc) of single wt channels under these conditions were 8.3 × 10-5 ± 5.7 × 10-5, 0.69 ± 0.26 ms, and 4.1 × 103 ± 1.3 × 103 ms (n = 9), respectively. On the other hand, under the same conditions, considerable opening events and altered gating were detected in single I4862A[19] mutant channels (Fig. 6B). The average Po, To, and Tc of single I4862A[19] mutant channels were 4.1 × 10-3 ± 3.8 × 10-3, 1.8 ± 0.8 ms, and 350 ± 120 ms (n = 7), respectively. Hence, the I4862A[19] mutation increased the channel Po by ∼50-fold and mean open time by ∼2-fold, and decreased the mean closed time by ∼90%. However, the single channel conductance of the I4862A[19] mutants (796 ± 2.5 picosiemens, n = 5) was indistinguishable from that of the wt (∼800 picosiemens). The marked decrease in mean closed time observed in single I4862A[19] mutant channels, compared with that of RyR2 wt, is consistent with the view that the I4862A[19] mutation may destabilize the closed state of the RyR2 channel. A destabilized closed state would be expected to cause spontaneous channel openings, and, consequently, depletion of the intracellular Ca2+ stores in HEK293 cells expressing the I4862A[19] mutant. This may account for the low level of caffeine-induced intracellular Ca2+ release observed in HEK293 cells expressing the I4862A[19] mutant (Fig. 1B). Taken together these observations indicate that mutations in TM10 can affect the gating properties of RyR2. In the present study we have investigated the role of the predicted TM10 transmembrane sequence in channel activation by caffeine and Ca2+ and in channel gating. Each residue within the 24-amino acid TM10 sequence was mutated, and the effect of each mutation on channel function was assessed. These studies have demonstrated that mutations in the TM10 sequence can reduce the sensitivity of the channel to activation by caffeine or severely curtail caffeine activation. Using [3H]ryanodine binding and single channel analysis we have shown that mutations in the TM10 sequence can influence the sensitivity of the channel to activation by Ca2+ and alter channel gating. We have also demonstrated recently that mutations in the TM10 sequence reduce or abolish [3H]ryanodine binding. Together, these results indicate that the TM10 sequence is involved in both Ca2+ activation and ryanodine interaction. This dual role of TM10 may provide an explanation for the action of ryanodine on channel open probability and Ca2+ sensitivity (27Masumiya H. Li P. Zhang L. Chen S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39727-39735Google Scholar). These data provide the first evidence that the TM10 sequence constitutes an essential determinant of RyR channel activation and gating. It is likely that the TM10 sequence plays an important role in communicating the signals of binding of ligands such as Ca2+, caffeine, and ryanodine to channel opening, but the exact mechanisms underlying the ligand gating of RyR are unknown. Fundamental insights into the gating mechanism of potassium channels have recently been revealed by determining the three-dimensional structures of several bacterial potassium channels (22Jiang Y. Lee A. Chen J. Cadene M. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Nature. 2002; 417: 523-526Google Scholar, 23Jiang Y. Lee A. Chen J. Cadene M. Chait B. MacKinnon R. Nature. 2002; 417: 515-522Google Scholar, 24Jiang Y. Lee A. Chen J. Ruta V. Cadene M. Chait B. MacKinnon R. Nature. 2003; 423: 33-41Google Scholar). A wide range of potassium channels seems to share a common structural basis for gating. Both ligand- and voltage-gated potassium channels contain a gating hinge located near the middle of the pore inner helix. It is believed that conformational changes in the gating domain induced by ligand binding or membrane voltage are transduced to the inner helices, causing the gating hinge to bend and resulting in opening of the inner helix bundle and the channel pore (22Jiang Y. Lee A. Chen J. Cadene M. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Nature. 2002; 417: 523-526Google Scholar). Although it is unclear whether the RyR channel adopts a gating mechanism similar to that seen with potassium channels, sequence analysis and functional studies suggest that the putative pore region of RyR may share a basic architecture with that of the bacterial potassium channel KcsA. With this rationale, Williams et al. (25Williams A.J. West D.J. Sitsapesan R. Q. Rev. Biophys. 2001; 34: 61-104Google Scholar) have proposed a structural model for the RyR channel pore. In this model, the TM10 sequence of RyR would be equivalent to the inner helix of KcsA. Thus, being analogous to the inner helix of KcsA, the putative inner helix of the RyR channel, TM10, would have a major role in channel gating. Our observations that mutations in the TM10 sequence can alter channel activation and gating corroborate this view. According to the hypothetical model of the RyR channel pore, the TM10 helices of each monomer would line a water-filled cavity of the tetrameric channel pore. In such an arrangement, one side of the TM10 helix would face the water-filled cavity, and the opposite side would interact with other helices or the lipid membrane. The amino acid residues that contribute to these two unique faces of the TM10 helix are unknown, but it is of interest to know that mutations that severely curtail caffeine or Ca2+ activation are predominantly clustered on one side of the TM10 helix. These mutations include I4844A[1], D4847A[4], F4850A[7], F4851A[8], F4852A[9], V4854A[11], I4855A[12], L4858A[15], L4859A[16], and I4866A[23]. On the other hand, most of the mutants located on the other side of the TM10 helix retain considerable channel activity. This side of the helix also contains residues Ala4860[17] and Gly4864[21], which have small side chains, and residues Thr4849[6] and Gln4863[20], which possess low relative hydrophobicity. If the TM10 helices do indeed form the water-filled cavity, one would expect that mutations of large and hydrophobic residues to a smaller and less hydrophobic residue, alanine, would have relatively mild effects on channel activity if the residue is facing the aqueous pore, but would impair channel function if the residue is involved in hydrophobic interactions. One would also expect that large and highly hydrophobic side chains pointing toward the aqueous pore would tend to impede ion conduction. On the basis of these rationales and the results of our mutational studies, we propose a model for the orientation of the TM10 helix in relation to the channel pore. As shown in Fig. 7, we hypothesize that the side of the TM10 helix containing smaller and less hydrophobic residues is oriented toward the water-filled cavity, whereas the opposite side of the helix is involved in hydrophobic interactions with other helices of the channel. In support of this model, we have shown that TM10 residues such as Phe4846[3], Thr4849[6], Val4856[13], and Gln4863[20] are critical for interaction with ryanodine (26Wang R. Zhang L. Bolstad J. Diao N. Brown C. Ruest L. Welch W. Williams A.J. Chen S.R.W. J. Biol. Chem. Octoer 13, 2003; (10.1074/jbc.M306788200)Google Scholar). These residues are located on the proposed pore-lining side of the TM10 helix, which is consistent with the notion that the high affinity ryanodine binding site is likely located in the outer vestibule of the RyR channel pore (31Tanna B. Welch W. Ruest L. Sutko J.L. Williams A.J. J. Gen. Physiol. 1998; 112: 55-69Google Scholar). Systematic investigations of the accessibility of the TM10 residues should provide further insight into the orientation of the TM10 helix within the channel pore. In potassium channels the water-filled cavity formed by the inner helices not only provides a pathway for ion conduction, but also contains receptor sites for the N-type inactivation gate and large, organic blocking cations (32Zhou M. Morais-Cabral J.H. Mann S. MacKinnon R. Muschol M. Dasgupta B.R. Salzberg B.M. Nature. 2001; 411: 657-661Google Scholar). Interestingly, permeant cation translocation in the RyR channel can be blocked by both potassium channel inactivation peptides (33Mead F.C. Sullivan D. Williams A.J. J. Membr. Biol. 1998; 163: 225-234Google Scholar) and large tetraalkylammonium cations such as tetrabutylammonium (34Tinker A. Lindsay A.R. Williams A.J. J. Membr. Biol. 1992; 127: 149-159Google Scholar), suggesting that the water-filled cavity of the RyR channel, presumably formed by the putative inner helix, TM10, may also contain receptor sites for peptides and organic cations. In this context, it will be of interest to determine whether the TM10 helix and, in particular, the proposed pore-lining face of the TM10 helix, is involved in interactions with various compounds and peptides that have been shown to alter the activity and conduction of RyR. In summary, mutations in the predicted TM10 transmembrane sequence can influence the activation and gating of the RyR2 channel. These data are in agreement with a structural model of the RyR pore in which the TM10 sequence constitutes the pore inner helix that lines the water-filled cavity and plays an important role in channel activation and gating. Further investigation of the orientation of the TM10 helix, the molecular determinants of the gating hinge and gating domain, and the interactions between them should help toward an understanding of the mechanisms of gating and Ca2+ activation of the RyR channel. We thank Dr. Alan Williams for helpful discussions and suggestions on modeling the RyR2 channel pore and for critical reading of the manuscript."

Papillomavirus is classified in the Papovaviridae family of double-stranded DNA tumor viruses, which also includes polyomaviruses such as SV40. There are about 100 identified papillomaviruses that infect humans.

Recently HPV-16, -18, and other high risk HPVs have been implicated as the necessary cause of cervical carcinoma, the second most frequent cancer in women worldwide and a major cause of death in countries that lack screening programs (1Walboomers J.M. Jacobs M.V. Manos M.M. Bosch F.X. Kummer J.A. Shah K.V. Snijders P.J. Peto J. Meijer C.J. Munoz N. J. Pathol. 1999; 189: 12-19Google Scholar). HPV-16 accounts for 50-60% of all cervical cancer cases and is the predominant type in carcinomas of squamous cell origin (2Bosch F.X. de Sanjosé S. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. Monogr. 2003; 31: 3-13Google Scholar). HPV-18 accounts for 10-12% of all cervical cancers and is the predominant type in adenocarcinomas and small cell neuroendocrine carcinomas of the cervix (2Bosch F.X. de Sanjosé S. J. Natl.

Adenocarcinomas are difficult to detect by the Papanicolaou (Pap) smear, and therefore cancer commonly associated with HPV-18 is often associated with rapidly progressing disease and death (3Crum C.P. Abbott D.W. Quade B.J. J. Clin. Oncol. 2003; 21: 224-230Google Scholar). High risk HPVs also play a role in cancers of the prostate, bladder, anus, penis, larynx, esophagus, oral cavity, and skin.

All types of papillomavirus are tropic for epithelial cells of skin and mucous membranes. The 8-kilobase pair genome encodes for six early (E) genes, involved in viral DNA replication, viral gene transcription, and cellular transformation, and two late (L) genes, which form the viral capsid. Stages in the viral life cycle are dependent on specific factors that are present in sequential differentiated stages of epithelial cells with expression of L genes restricted to the outermost layer of differentiated keratinocytes. While cervical cancer cells contain chromosomally integrated HPV DNA or a mixture of both integrated and episomal DNA, in non-cancerous or premalignant warts, the HPV genome is strictly episomal (4Cullen A.P. Reid R. Campion M. Lorincz A.T. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 606-612Google Scholar). HPV episomes associate with cellular histones in a chromatin-like assembly. The primary viral proteins expressed in the basal cells are E1 and E2, which are both essential for initiation of papillomavirus DNA replication in vivo (5Sanders C.M. Stenlund A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7044-7055Google Scholar, 6Lusky M. Hurwitz J. Seo Y.-S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8895-8899Google Scholar). DNA replication is one of the central processes in viral maintenance, and the machinery involved would be a good target for the design of antiviral therapy at benign and premalignant stages of disease. E1 is involved in all steps of replication initiation: origin (ori) recognition, ATP-dependent DNA melting, and unwinding of DNA (for a review, see Ref. 7Wilson V.G. West M. Woytek K. Rangasamy D. Virus Genes. 2002; 24: 275-290Google Scholar). The protein is highly conserved among papillomaviruses and consists of a DNA-binding domain (DBD) and an ATPase/helicase domain. We previously determined the crystal structure of the BPV-1 E1-DBD (residues 159-303) (8Enemark E.J. Chen G. Vaughn D.E. Stenlund A. Joshua-Tor L. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 149-158Google Scholar) and found it to be structurally similar to the DBD of SV40 large T antigen, although sequence conservation is only 6%. Others have reported structural similarities with additional viral proteins essential for DNA replication and integration, such as the DBD of the geminivirus tomato yellow leaf curl virus Rep and the endonuclease domain of adeno-associated virus Rep (9Campos-Olivas R.

Cell. 2002; 10: 327-337Google Scholar). While monomeric in solution, full-length E1 must first bind to the viral ori as a dimer along with a dimer of E2 (11Chen G. Stenlund A. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 2567-2576Google Scholar). The DBD of E1 alone is highly sequence-specific, but in the context of full-length protein, which also contains the nonspecific DNA binding activity of the E1 helicase domain, E1 requires interactions with E2 to block nonspecific E1/DNA interactions (12Stenlund A. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 954-963Google Scholar). Recently inhibitors of the E1/E2 interaction have been reported to inhibit in vivo DNA replication for low risk HPV types 6 and 11 but not for high risk HPVs (13White P.W. Titolo S. Brault K. Thauvette L. Pelletier A. Welchner E. Bourgon L. Doyon L. Ogilvie W.W. Yoakim C. Cordingley M.G. Archambault J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26765-26772Google Scholar). Once the initial E1 dimer has been loaded by E2, more molecules of E1 are recruited by E2 bound at a distal site to form a tetrameric E1 complex (14Sanders C.M. Stenlund A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3522-3534Google Scholar). Ultimately two hexameric E1 helicases are assembled that have ATPase activity and can unwind the DNA (5Sanders C.M. Stenlund A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7044-7055Google Scholar, 14Sanders C.M. Stenlund A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3522-3534Google Scholar). We have also previously determined the crystal structures of the BPV-1 E1-DBD dimer bound to DNA and tetramer bound to DNA (15Enemark E.J. Stenlund A. Joshua-Tor L. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1487-1496Google Scholar), and the ringlike hexameric helicase form of E1 has been visualized by electron microscopy (16Fouts E.T. Yu X. Egelman E.H. Botchan M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4447-4458Google Scholar). E1 dimerization is due to the interaction of hydrophobic residues in the third α-helix of each monomer. The interface is small, burying only 500 Å2 of monomer surface area (8Enemark E.J. Chen G. Vaughn D.E. Stenlund A. Joshua-Tor L. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 149-158Google Scholar). While the hydrophobicity of the dimer interface is conserved among all papillomavirus types, the actual residues involved are very poorly conserved. However, this interaction is crucial to replication initiation as mutation of one hydrophobic residue in BPV-1 E1-DBD (Val-202 or Ala-206) or HPV-11 E1-DBD (Ala-251) to arginine inhibits the ability of E1-DBD to bind to ori DNA as a dimer in vitro, and in the context of full-length E1, these mutations prevent DNA replication in vivo (8Enemark E.J. Chen G. Vaughn D.E. Stenlund A. Joshua-Tor L. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 149-158Google Scholar, 17Titolo S. Brault K. Majewski J. White P.W. Archambault J. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 5178-5191Google Scholar). 2A. Stenlund, personal communication. The E1 dimerization interface is a logical target for the disruption of DNA replication by a small molecule because of its limited surface area and functional importance. In this study, we present the structure of the E1-DBD from the high risk HPV-18 and provide evidence that E1 dimerization via the α3 helix is conserved, although the conformation of the α3 helix differs from that of BPV-1 E1. This structural information is important for the development of specific antiviral therapeutics to this clinically relevant group of viruses. E1 binds to overlapping sites in the ori in the assembly of E1 complexes (18Sedman T. Sedman J. Stenlund A. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 2887-2896Google Scholar, 19Chen G. Stenlund A. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 292-302Google Scholar). The initial E1-DBD dimer binds cooperatively, as shown for BPV-1 and HPV-11, to palindromic hexanucleotide sites (called sites 2 and 4, see Table I) that are separated by 3 base pairs in the ori and have the consensus sequence ATTGTT (17Titolo S. Brault K. Majewski J. White P.W. Archambault J. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 5178-5191Google Scholar, 19Chen G. Stenlund A. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 292-302Google Scholar). These sites encompass two consecutive major grooves of DNA, one helical turn apart, and binding of the E1-DBD dimer results in compression of the minor groove and increased positive rise, twist, and slide and negative roll of the DNA in the BPV-1 E1-DBD/DNA co-crystal structure (15Enemark E.J. Stenlund A. Joshua-Tor L. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1487-1496Google Scholar). Circular permutation assays have indicated that binding of the BPV-1 E1-DBD dimer confers a bend of 40-50° in the DNA (20Gillitzer E. Chen G. Stenlund A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3069-3079Google Scholar), and hydroxy radical footprinting experiments have demonstrated that DNA sequences extending beyond the E1 binding sites (BSs) are involved in E1 binding and DNA bending (21Chen G. Stenlund A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 7712-7720Google Scholar).Table IE1 binding sites from 20 papillomaviruses Open table in a new tab The DNA-binding region of E1 consists of the fourth α-helix and a well ordered loop, which form a continuous area on the surface of the protein but bind separately to the two individual strands of the DNA (15Enemark E.J. Stenlund A. Joshua-Tor L. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1487-1496Google Scholar). The DNA-binding helix makes only nonspecific phosphate backbone interactions, while the DNA-binding loop is responsible for all base-specific contacts (15Enemark E.J. Stenlund A. Joshua-Tor L. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1487-1496Google Scholar). The residues that contact the DNA are very well conserved between all papillomaviruses. All of the base-specific contacts are van der Waals interactions, and they primarily involve the thymidine in position 2 of each hexanucleotide site. One specific protein-DNA contact (shown for BPV-1) is a threonine in the DNA-binding loop (Thr-187) with the methyl group of this thymidine (15Enemark E.J. Stenlund A. Joshua-Tor L. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1487-1496Google Scholar, 22Gonzalez A. Bazaldua-Hernandez C. West M. Woytek K. Wilson V.G. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 245-253Google Scholar). DNA binding is abrogated if Thr-187 is changed to an alanine or if the thymidine in position 2 of either E1-BS, site 2 or 4, is changed to any other base, including a change to uridine, which removes only the methyl group. This is the only nucleotide position that has an absolute requirement for a particular base (shown for BPV-1 and HPV-11) (15Enemark E.J. Stenlund A. Joshua-Tor L. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1487-1496Google Scholar, 17Titolo S. Brault K. Majewski J. White P.W. Archambault J. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 5178-5191Google Scholar), and this thymidine (shown in red in Table I) is in fact conserved among many papillomavirus sequences. However, the hexanucleotide sequence of site 2 in the HPV-18 ori deviates and instead has a T-to-A transversion in position 2 (shown in blue in Table I). In this study, we present evidence that the thymidine in BS2 is dispensable for HPV-18 E1 DNA recognition although the thymidine in BS4 is significant, and the threonine in the DNA-binding loop equivalent to BPV-1 Thr-187 (HPV-18 Thr-238) is also nonessential for HPV-18 E1 DNA binding. The differences in DNA binding may be related to the structural differences at the HPV-18 E1 dimerization interface and/or differences in the electrostatic potential energy surface of the HPV-18 E1-DBD. Protein Expression, Site-directed Mutagenesis, and Purification—The plasmid for expression of the minimal HPV-18 E1-DBD (amino acids 210-354) as a glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein with an internal thrombin cleavage site was provided by Arne Stenlund (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory). The plasmid encoding an additional HPV-18 E1 fragment (amino acids 193-425) was cloned from genomic DNA (ATCC) into the BamHI and XhoI sites of pGEX-4T-1 (Amersham Biosciences), resulting in an N-terminal GST-tagged protein with an internal thrombin cleavage site. Plasmids for expression of the HPV-18 E1-(193-425) fragment with N-terminal hemagglutinin (HA) or FLAG tags were cloned by insertion of a cassette containing the respective epitope tag between the thrombin cleavage site and the first codon of the protein. Single amino acid substitutions were introduced in vectors encoding untagged, HA-tagged, and FLAG-tagged HPV-18 E1-(193-425) using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. All HPV-18 E1-DBD fragments were expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21DE3 at 17 °C by induction with 0.4 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 12 h. The proteins were purified using the procedure described previously for the BPV-1 E1-DBD (8Enemark E.J. Chen G. Vaughn D.E. Stenlund A. Joshua-Tor L. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 149-158Google Scholar). Crystallization, Data Collection, Structure Solution, and Refinement—Crystals were grown by the hanging drop method at 17 °C using a 5 mg/ml protein solution containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, and 10 mm dithiothreitol and a reservoir solution consisting of 28-30% polyethylene glycol 4000, 100 mm ammonium acetate, 100 mm sodium citrate, pH 5.0-5.6, and 50-100 mm dithiothreitol in a 1:1 (protein:reservoir) ratio for a drop volume of 2 μl. Crystals with typical dimensions around 0.1 × 0.05 × 0.05 mm grew within 2 weeks. Data were collected at beamline X26C at the National Synchrotron Light Source at Brookhaven National Laboratory at 100 K by flash-freezing crystals directly in the cryostream. See Table II for data collection statistics. Diffraction data were processed and scaled with HKL2000 (23Otwinowski Z. Minor W.

Crystallogr. 2000; 56: 1622-1624Google Scholar) (resolution range 30-3 Å) using a search model based on the crystal structure of the minimal E1-DBD from BPV-1 (amino acids 159-303) (8Enemark E.J. Chen G. Vaughn D.E. Stenlund A. Joshua-Tor L. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 149-158Google Scholar) in which non-identical residues were changed to alanine. The initial R factor was 0.527, and the correlation coefficient was 0.267. The B factors of the starting model were set to 19 Å2 according to the Wilson plot. The model phases were used as the starting phases for the solvent-flattening routine of CNS (25Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.-S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Google Scholar). The model was then refined against the data with CNS followed by iterative model building using O (26Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowen S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Google Scholar). 5% of reflections were randomly reserved for calculating the Rfree at all stages to monitor refinement. Several cycles of model building and refinement allowed for the placement of water molecules and two alternate side chain conformations to produce the final model. The criteria for the assignment of a Fo - Fc density peak as water is a peak height greater than 4 σ and a hydrogen bonding distance between the solvent peak and any protein oxygen or nitrogen atom between 2.5 and 3.5 Å. The water scrutinizer routine of XPAND was used to check the validity of water molecules (27Kleywegt G.J. Zou J.Y. Kjeldgaard M. Jones T.A. Rossman M.G. Arnold E. International Tables for Crystallography, Vol. F. Crystallography of Biological Macromolecules. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands2001: 353-356Google Scholar). The final model contains clear electron density for residues 210-353 with a break in the density from residues 231 to 239. Three residues (Gly, Ser, and Arg) that remain on the N terminus after cleavage of the protein from GST are not clearly visible in the electron density. See Table II for refinement details. Figures were prepared with MOLSCRIPT (28Kraulis P.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 946-950Google Scholar), BOBSCRIPT (29Esnouf R.M. J. Mol. Graph. 1997; 15: 132-134Google Scholar), and Raster 3D (30Bacon D.J. Anderson W.F. J. Mol. Graph. 1988; 6: 219-220Google Scholar, 31Merritt E.A. Murphy M.E.P. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 869-873Google Scholar). Gel Mobility Shift Assays—The 105-bp probe for gel mobility shift assays was generated by PCR amplification of HPV-18 genomic DNA containing the ori using a plus strand primer that was 5′-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase. The probe was gel-purified by 8% non-denaturing PAGE, exposure to film, and elution of DNA from acrylamide slices by overnight incubation in Tris-EDTA. For DNA competition assays, 21-bp DNA containing wild type HPV-18, mutant HPV-18, or BPV-1 E1 binding sites as found in the respective origins of replication was synthesized by Operon with the trityl protecting group left on and purified by reverse-phase chromatography, on-column deprotection, desalting, and ion exchange chromatography. Competition assays were performed as described previously (32Carey M. Smale S.T. Transcriptional Regulation in Eukaryotes. Concepts, Strategies, and Techniques. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000: 257-268Google Scholar). Serial dilutions of competitor DNA were incubated with 10 ng of HPV-18 E1-DBD (amino acids 193-425) for 15 min at room temperature in a buffer containing 20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, 200 mm sodium chloride to minimize nonspecific E1/DNA interactions, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 3 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.7 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. The reaction buffer for gel shift assays with dimerization mutant proteins (data not shown) contained 100 mm NaCl, and HA-tagged proteins were supershifted with monoclonal antibody anti-HA tag (12CA5, produced and purified by the Antibody Facility of Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory). After preincubation, the radiolabeled probe (25,000 cpm/reaction) and 40 ng/reaction nonspecific competitor DNA (pGEX-4T-1) were added to each reaction. Samples were incubated at room temperature for an additional 30 min and then were resolved by 5% PAGE 39:1 (acrylamide:bisacrylamide) in 0.5× Tris-Borate-EDTA. After electrophoresis, the gels were dried and subjected to autoradiography. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot Analysis—Immunoprecipitation of FLAG fusion proteins and associated proteins was performed with anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel according to the manufacturer's protocol (Sigma). Binding reactions and washes were carried out in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, and sodium chloride at the concentrations indicated in Fig. 3. Proteins were eluted into Laemmli sample buffer and loaded onto 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels followed by transfer to Hybond-P membranes (Amersham Biosciences) using a semi-dry transfer apparatus. Blocking and antibody incubations were all carried out in 5% (w/v) nonfat milk in Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween 20, and washes were with Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween 20. The primary antibody was anti-FLAG polyclonal (Sigma) at a concentration of 1:1000, and the secondary antibody was goat anti-rabbit IgG (heavy + light)-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Bio-Rad) at a concentration of 1:3000. Proteins were detected by incubation with Super Signal West Pico chemiluminescent reagent (Pierce) followed by exposure to x-ray film. Overall Structure of the HPV-18 E1-DBD and Comparison with BPV-1 E1-DBD—The minimal stable DBD in BPV-1 E1 (residues 159-303) was identified by limited proteolysis, determined by gel mobility shift analysis to have DNA binding activity, and shown to possess a fold unique to viral ori-binding proteins (8Enemark E.J. Chen G. Vaughn D.E. Stenlund A. Joshua-Tor L. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 149-158Google Scholar, 9Campos-Olivas R. Louis J.M. Clérot D. Gronenborn B. Gronenborn A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 10310-10315Google Scholar, 10Hickman A.B. Ronning D.R. Kotin R.M. Dyda F. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 327-337Google Scholar). Because the sequence identity between BPV-1 E1-DBD and the analogous E1-DBD from several high risk HPVs, including HPV-18, is limited to 30-35% (Fig. 1A) and because of the difference in the HPV-18 E1-BS as compared with other papillomaviral origins of replication (Table I), we wanted to study whether there are any structural and/or biochemical differences among these proteins. We expressed the HPV-18 E1-DBD (residues 210-354) as a GST fusion protein, cleaved the E1-DBD from GST, and purified the protein to homogeneity. The crystal structure of HPV-18 E1-DBD (residues 210-354), containing one molecule in the asymmetric unit, was solved by molecular replacement and refined to 1.8-Å resolution. As expected, the structure has the same overall fold as the E1-DBD from BPV-1, namely a central five-stranded antiparallel β-sheet flanked by four loosely packed α-helices on one side and two tightly packed helices on the other side (Fig. 1B). While the DNA-binding loop was very well ordered in the BPV-1 E1-DBD monomer structure, it is disordered in the structure of the HPV-18 E1-DBD. The BPV-1 E1-DBD monomer crystals grew from a high salt condition, and the ions in the solution were bound to the DNA-binding loop, mimicking some of the phosphates of a DNA backbone, as later seen from the co-crystal structure with DNA (15Enemark E.J. Stenlund A. Joshua-Tor L. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1487-1496Google Scholar). However, the HPV-18 E1-DBD crystals grew from a low salt condition, so this effect was not present. The overall root mean square deviation (r.m.s.d.) between the DBD of HPV-18 E1 and BPV-1 E1 is 1.13 Å for 132 aligned α-carbons (LSQMAN (33Kleywegt G.J. Jones T.A. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 525-545Google Scholar)). As shown in Fig. 1C, there are four regions for which the two molecules do not superimpose as well: the disordered DNA-binding loop (HPV-18 E1-DBD residues 231-239), an extended β-hairpin of no known function (residues 272-283), a small loop of no known function (residues 334-337), and the α3 helix shown to be required for BPV-1 2A. Stenlund, personal communication. (8Enemark E.J. Chen G. Vaughn D.E. Stenlund A. Joshua-Tor L. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 149-158Google Scholar) and HPV-11 (17Titolo S. Brault K. Majewski J. White P.W. Archambault J. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 5178-5191Google Scholar) DNA-dependent E1 dimerization and replication function (residues 252-263). The HPV-18 E1-DBD α3 helix is a residue shorter in length than the analogous BPV-1 E1-DBD α3 helix (residues 201-213) (8Enemark E.J. Chen G. Vaughn D.E. Stenlund A. Joshua-Tor L. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 149-158Google Scholar). Also, as seen in Fig. 1B, the HPV-18 E1-DBD α3 helix has an obvious kink, which is clearly defined in the electron density, that is not present in the BPV-1 E1-DBD. The DNA-binding helix is unchanged between HPV-18 and BPV-1 E1-DBD. The kink in the HPV-18 E1-DBD α3 helix is due to differences in the hydrogen (H)-bonding network (see Fig. 2). A straight α-helix retains its shape because of the backbone H-bonding interaction between the CO group of each residue n with the NH group of residue (n + 4). In the HPV-18 E1-DBD α3 helix, there are four residues that H-bond with the NH group of the (n + 3) residue rather than the (n + 4): Ile-254 with Gly-257, Ala-255 with Phe-258, Ile-262 with Phe-265, and Gln-263 with Ile-266 (HBPLUS (34McDonald I.K. Thornton J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 238: 777-793Google Scholar)), resulting in a partial 310 helix. In contrast, the α3 helix in the BPV-1 E1-DBD structure consists of only (n + 4) backbone H-bonding interactions of a typical, straight α-helix. The HPV-18 E1 α3 helix is also stabilized by a tightly bound water molecule, which H-bonds to the CO groups of residues Ala-255 and Glu-256 and the NH groups of residues Phe-258 and Lys-259 (XPAND (27Kleywegt G.J. Zou J.Y. Kjeldgaard M. Jones T.A. Rossman M.G. Arnold E. International Tables for Crystallography, Vol. F. Crystallography of Biological Macromolecules. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands2001: 353-356Google Scholar)). However, in the BPV-1 E1-DBD structure there is no solvent bound to α3 helix residues. Finally residue Thr-253 in the HPV-18 E1-DBD α3 helix does not participate in any H-bonding interactions either to other residues or to solvent, whereas the equivalent residue (Val-202) in the BPV-1 E1-DBD makes the typical (n + 4) H-bonds. For BPV-1, there were four different interaction surfaces between E1-DBD monomers in the E1-DBD crystal, one of which placed the DNA-binding surfaces of each monomer exactly one helical turn apart, and this was shown by mutational analysis to constitute the natural dimer (8Enemark E.J. Chen G. Vaughn D.E. Stenlund A. Joshua-Tor L. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 149-158Google Scholar). This contact was also present in several other crystal forms of BPV-1 E1-DBD. However, for the HPV-18 E1-DBD crystals, there was no apparent biologically relevant dimer from crystal packing. It should be noted that the same α3 helix interface was not used for lattice interactions, and therefore its different conformation is probably not due to crystal packing forces. The difference in the HPV-18 E1 α3 helix structure and the T-to-A transversion in the HPV-18 E1 binding site 2 (Table I) brought up the possibility that HPV-18 E1 dimerizes and/or contacts the DNA differently.

https://openalex.org/W1997483799,"Despite several concordant structural studies on the initial non-covalent complex that serpins form with target proteinases, a recent study on the non-covalent complex between the serpin α1-proteinase inhibitor (α1PI) and anhydroelastase (Mellet, P., and Bieth, J. G. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275, 10788–10795) concluded that translocation of the proteinase precedes cleavage of the reactive center loop and formation of the acyl ester. Because this conclusion is diametrically opposite to those of the other structural studies on serpin-proteinase pairs, we proceeded to examine this specific serpin-proteinase complex by the same successful NMR approach used previously on the α1PI-Pittsburgh-S195A trypsin pair. Both non-covalent complex with anhydroelastase and covalent complex with active elastase were made with 15N-alanine-labeled wild-type α1PI. The heteronuclear single quantum correlation spectroscopy (HSQC) NMR spectrum of the non-covalent complex showed that the entire reactive center loop remained exposed, and the serpin body maintained a conformation indistinguishable from that of native α1PI, indicating no movement of the proteinase and no insertion of the reactive center loop into β-sheet A. In contrast, the HSQC NMR spectrum of the covalent complex showed that the reactive center loop had fully inserted into β-sheet A, indicating that translocation of the proteinase had occurred. These results agree with previous NMR, fluorescence resonance energy transfer, and x-ray crystallographic studies and suggest that a common mechanism is employed in formation of serpin-proteinase complexes. We found that preparations of anhydroelastase that are not appropriately purified contain material that can regenerate active elastase over time. It is likely that the material used by Mellet and Bieth contained such active elastase, resulting in mistaken attribution of the behavior of covalent complex to that of the non-covalent complex.

Serpins are a large and growing superfamily of proteins, many of which are inhibitors of serine proteinase and some of which can also inhibit cysteine proteinases (1Gettins P.G.W. Chem. Rev. 2002; 102: 4751-4804Crossref PubMed Scopus (1003) Google Scholar). X-ray structures have now been determined for 10 different serpins in their active conformations, all of which show the same overall fold and a prominent, exposed reactive center loop through which the serpin makes initial contact with the target proteinase (1Gettins P.G.W. Chem. Rev. 2002; 102: 4751-4804Crossref PubMed Scopus (1003) Google Scholar). Much early biochemical data had indicated that serpins function by a mechanism very different from that of lock-and-key type proteinase inhibitors of the Kunitz, Kazal, and Bowman-Birk families (2Patston P.A.

However, prior to definitive structural studies, the details of the mechanism had remained highly controversial (8Wright H.T. Scarsdale J.N. Proteins. 1995; 22: 210-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). In the past 6 years structural studies on the final serpin-proteinase complex and on intermediates in the pathway have led to a coherent picture of how serpins inhibit serine proteinases by a suicide substrate mechanism (Fig. 1) (9Stratikos E.

This mechanism involves formation of an initial noncovalent Michaelis-like complex between the proteinase and specificity-determining residues in the exposed RCL. 1The abbreviations used are: RCL, reactive center loop; α1PI, α1-proteinase inhibitor; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; PAI-1, plasminogen activator inhibitor 1; HSQC, heteronuclear single quantum correlation spectroscopy. This complex requires little or no change in conformation of the RCL, and no insertion of the RCL into β-sheet A of the serpin. The catalytic apparatus of the proteinase then attacks the scissile peptide bond in the serpin RCL leading to formation of a covalent acyl-enzyme intermediate between the peptide carbonyl of the P1 residue and Ser-195 of the proteinase and cleavage of the RCL. This RCL cleavage then permits unrestrained insertion of the RCL into β-sheet A, with concomitant movement of the attached proteinase. Following full insertion of the RCL, the proteinase is then held sufficiently tightly against the bottom of the serpin that the proteinase active site residues are disoriented, rendering the proteinase catalytically incompetent and hence trapping the proteinase in a kinetically stabilized covalent acyl-enzyme complex. The source of the energy required to distort the proteinase is believed to come from the enhanced stability of the loop-inserted conformation of the serpin (16Boudier C. Bieth J.G. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 9962-9967Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 17Kaslik G. Kardos J. Szabó L. Závodszky P. Westler W.M. Markley J.L. Gráf L.

This highly unusual mechanism is now supported by structural studies on a significant number of different serpin-proteinase complexes.

In this context of general agreement on the structures of the initial and final complexes, it is particularly surprising to encounter studies that claim very different structures for such complexes. Recently this has been the case for the covalent complex formed between α1-antichymotrypsin and chymotrypsin, in which it was proposed that little movement of the proteinase occurs (23O'Malley K.M. Cooperman B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6631-6637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), and conversely for the α1PI-anhydroelastase non-covalent complex for which it was proposed that full proteinase translocation occurs (24Mellet P. Bieth J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10788-10795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Because the two-dimensional NMR method that we used for examining α1PI-Pittsburgh-trypsin covalent and non-covalent complexes (20Peterson F.C. Gettins P.G.W. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6284-6292Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 21Peterson F.C. Gordon N.C. Gettins P.G.W. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11884-11892Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) proved to be both very sensitive to conformational differences in the RCL and body of the serpin and to give results that were in full agreement with both earlier fluorescence resonance energy transfer studies and later x-ray studies on the same complexes, we decided to use this method to examine the specific serpin-proteinase pair examined by Mellet and Bieth (24Mellet P. Bieth J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10788-10795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) to determine whether or not the nature of the pair radically affected the conformation of the complex. Expression and Purification of α1PI and 15N-Ala-labeled α1PI—The plasmid pQE30-multi8α1PI was made from pQE30-multi9α1PI (21Peterson F.C. Gordon N.C. Gettins P.G.W. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11884-11892Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) by changing the P1 arginine residue back to the wild-type methionine. The multi7 variant of human α1PI has 7 stabilizing mutations that improve the thermal stability and prevent loop-sheet polymerization (25Im H. Seo E.J. Yu M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11072-11077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) but otherwise has similar inhibitory properties to that of the natural wild-type protein. The multi8 variant contains an additional change of Cys-232 to serine to prevent unwanted disulfide-mediated dimerization during refolding. α1PI was expressed in Escherichia coli, isolated as inclusion bodies, refolded, and purified as described previously (21Peterson F.C. Gordon N.C. Gettins P.G.W. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11884-11892Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). For specific labeling with 15N-Ala, cells were grown in minimal medium supplemented with 100 mg liter-115N-Ala and 100 mg liter-1 of all other amino acids except alanine, as described previously. We use the name α1PI subsequently to represent the multi8 variant that has a natural P1 methionine. To maximize the yield of serpin, α1PI was also isolated from the supernatant and purified by the same steps as for refolded material. The concentration of α1PI was determined spectro-photometrically using an extinction coefficient at 280 nm of 0.43 for a 1 mg ml-1 solution. Preparation of α1PI-Sepharose—Anhydroelastase was purified by affinity chromatography on α1PI-Sepharose to ensure that homogeneous, inactive anhydroelastase was isolated for all subsequent experiments. α1PI was coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4 Fast Flow (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. 20 mg of α1PI was used for coupling to each milliliter of resin. After 90 min at room temperature, 16 mg of protein was bound per ml of Sepharose. After blocking unreacted groups and washing, a 7-ml column was prepared for purification of anhydroelastase. Preparation and Purification of Anhydroelastase—Porcine pancreatic elastase from Calbiochem (catalog number 324682) was used as the starting material. A stock solution of ∼10 mg ml-1 was prepared in 5 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 4.5, containing 1 mm EDTA and kept at 4 °C until use. Elastase concentration was determined using ∈280 = 2.1 ml·mg-1·cm-1. The stock solution was diluted to 20 μm (0.52 mg/ml) with 5 mm sodium citrate, and the pH was adjusted to 7.0 with 1 m sodium citrate. Aliquots of PMSF (stock solution of 50 mm in methanol) were added, and the mixture was incubated on ice. A total of 4–5-fold molar excess of PMSF and 16 h were necessary to obtain ≤0.5% residual activity. 1 m prechilled NaOH was added to a final concentration of 0.1 m to effect the β-elimination and generate anhydroelastase (26Ako H. Foster R.J. Ryan C.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1972; 47: 1402-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 27Ako H. Foster R.J. Ryan C.A. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 132-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The reaction was stopped after 2 h by adjusting the pH to 6.0 with 1 m acetic acid. N-MeO-succinyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Val-chloromethyl ketone (Sigma) was added to 2 μm (∼10% of total elastase concentration) to inhibit any residual activity. The mixture was further incubated on ice for 16 h, concentrated, and then clarified by centrifugation. About half of the crude material was lost to precipitation. The clarified crude anhydroelastase had <0.05% activity. Crude anhydroelastase (5–10 mg in 0.5–1 column volume) was applied to the α1PI-Sepharose column (7 ml) in high pH buffer (0.2 m Tris, 0.2 m NaCl, pH 8.0) and eluted by a step pH gradient. The gradients were by mixing different ratios of the high pH buffer and a low pH buffer (0.2 m sodium acetate, 0.2 m NaCl, pH 4.0). Activity of selected fractions was measured immediately after purification and also after prolonged storage at 4 °C. Anhydroelastase was found in peak II, being characterized by weak binding to α1PI-Sepharose, and lack of proteolytic activity (i.e. <0.01%) even after prolonged storage. The middle of peak II was used for our studies. The overall yield was about 30%. Kinetic Assays—Elastase activity was measured by using the chromogenic substrate succinyl-Ala-Ala-Ala-p-nitroaniline. The assay buffer was either 100 mm HEPES, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% PEG-8000, pH 8.0, or 50 mm HEPES, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% PEG-8000, pH 8.0, as indicated. The substrate concentration was 220 μm (except for KM determination where it varied between 0.22 and 4.4 mm and for the inhibition assays where it was 660 μm). Absorbance was monitored at 410 nm for 1–20 min at 25 °C. Active elastase concentrations were 1–20 nm. PMS or anhydroelastase concentrations were 0.02–2 μm. Anhydroelastase Binding to α1PI—Independent kinetic demonstration of the binding of anhydroelastase to α1PI was performed analogously to a previous demonstration of S195A tissue plasminogen activator binding to PAI-1 (28Olson S.T. Swanson R. Day D. Verhamme I. Kvassman J. Shore J.D. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11742-11756Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 29Delaglio F. Grzesiak A. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11638) Google Scholar). 100 nm final α1PI was premixed with 0, 10, and 20 μm (final concentration) anhydroelastase in 50 mm HEPES, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% PEG-8000, pH 8.0, containing 660 μm succinyl-Ala-Ala-Ala-p-nitroaniline. The reaction was started by addition of active elastase to a final concentration of 10 nm. Absorbance at 410 nm was monitored until no further increase was observed. The pseudo-first-order inhibition rate constants (kobs) were determined by nonlinear regression. The KD of the α1PI-anhydroelastase complex was calculated using the equation: KD = [EAH]·(q/(1 - q))/(1 + [S]/KM), where q = kobs/kobs,0; [S] is the substrate concentration; [EAH] is the anhydroelastase concentration, and KM is the Michaelis constant. kobs,0 is the pseudo-first-order inhibition rate constant measured in the absence of anhydroelastase. KM was determined to be 1.45 mm in 50 mm HEPES, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% PEG-8000, pH 8.0. Preparation of Cleaved α1PI and α1PI-Elastase Covalent Complex— Active elastase and 15N-Ala-labeled α1PI were reacted in 20 mm Tris, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0 buffer. Initial concentrations were 2 μm (52 μg/ml) for elastase and 3.6 μm (162 μg/ml) for α1PI (1:1.8 molar ratio). After 20 min at room temperature, 20 μmN-MeO-succinyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Val-chloromethyl ketone was added to inhibit any residual activity, and the mixture was stored at 4 °C until further use. The final composition of the mixture was ≤2 μm covalent complex, and ∼0.8–0.8 μm cleaved and native α1PI, respectively, together with small amounts of degradation products. The mixture was stable for several weeks due to the presence of excess native α1PI and inhibition of residual elastolytic activity. After concentration and buffer exchange, the covalent complex was purified by chromatofocusing. A mixture containing ∼ 25 mg of covalent complex in starting buffer (25 mm imidazole, pH 7.4) was applied in ≤1 column volume to a 23-ml PBE 94 (Amersham Biosciences) column and eluted with 1:8 diluted polybuffer 74 (Amersham Biosciences), pH 5.0. The first peak was pure covalent complex, and subsequent overlapping peaks were degradation products, native α1PI, and cleaved α1PI. Immediately after purification, 20 μm chloromethyl ketone and 2 μm unlabeled native α1PI (an estimated 15% molar ratio assuming 100% yield) were added to the covalent complex-containing fractions to prevent any cleavage of the complex by any free elastase that might form from complex hydrolysis. Polybuffer was removed during concentration of the sample on 30-kDa cut-off membranes. The extinction coefficient of the covalent complex was calculated from that of the components (∈280 = 1.04 ml·mg-1·cm-1). The final yield for the covalent complex was 50–60%. Fractions containing cleaved α1PI were combined (pH ≈6.0), concentrated, and heated at 90 °C for 30 min. An equal volume of 500 mm NaCl, 20 mm, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, was then immediately added. Most of the contaminating proteins precipitated due to the heat treatment, except cleaved α1PI, which has a melting point of >120 °C. The mixture was clarified by centrifugation and filtration, and monomeric cleaved α1PI was separated from soluble aggregates and polybuffer by gel filtration on a Superdex-75 column (Amersham Biosciences). The overall yield for cleaved α1PI was 20–30%. 1H-15N HSQC NMR—All NMR experiments were performed at 318 K on a Bruker DRX600 spectrometer equipped with a 5-mm 1H/15N/13C triple resonance cryoprobe and pulse field gradient capability. 15N-Ala-labeled native α1PI and cleaved α1PI were both 200 μm in 10% D2O, 90% H2O, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 0.02% NaN3. The non-covalent complex was made in the same buffer using 200 μm15N-Ala-labeled native α1PI and an excess (300 μm) of unlabeled anhydroelastase. The covalent complex was ∼350 μm in the same buffer, except that the NaCl concentration was 300 mm to avoid precipitation/aggregation, and contained ∼100 μm unlabeled native α1PI. Data collection times were 3.8, 5.7, 14.3, and 15.3 h for native α1PI, cleaved α1PI, the noncovalent complex, and the covalent complex, respectively. NMR data were processed using NMRPipe software (29Delaglio F. Grzesiak A. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11638) Google Scholar). The Non-covalent Complex of α1PI with Anhydroelastase—We have previously used two-dimensional 1H-15N HSQC NMR of 15N-Ala-labeled α1PI-Pittsburgh as an extremely sensitive means of separately evaluating the conformations of the body of the serpin and of the reactive center loop when it forms covalent complex with trypsin or non-covalent complex with S195A trypsin (20Peterson F.C. Gettins P.G.W. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6284-6292Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 21Peterson F.C. Gordon N.C. Gettins P.G.W. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11884-11892Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The spectrum of the native serpin shows the expected number of resolved resonances, with those from the cluster of RCL alanines in the center of the spectrum, reflecting their exposed, non-structured environment. Upon RCL cleavage and insertion into β-sheet A, the resonance of every alanine changes chemical shift, although the changes are particularly pronounced for the alanines from the RCL, because they undergo the most drastic change in environment, from exposed and unstructured to being a central strand of β-sheet A. Although wild-type α1PI was used for the present study rather than the Pittsburgh variant, which contains a P1 arginine, the two-dimensional HSQC spectra of both native and cleaved forms were essentially identical to those of the Pittsburgh variant (Fig. 2, A and D). This is in keeping with x-ray structures of the native states of wild-type and Pittsburgh α1PIs, which are superimposable in both the body and RCL with minimal root mean square deviation. Accordingly, assignments obtained previously for selected alanines of the RCL and the serpin body are readily transferable to the spectra of the wild-type protein for both the native (Fig. 2A) and cleaved (Fig. 2D) states. The HSQC NMR spectrum of the non-covalent complex of 15N-Ala-labeled α1PI with anhydroelastase gave a single set of resolved resonances (Fig. 2C) that differed primarily from the spectrum of native α1PI in being a little broader, but at otherwise similar chemical shifts. Importantly, the presence of only a single set of visible resonances indicates that any uncomplexed 15N-labeled α1PI must be undetectable under the conditions of the NMR experiment. The lack of chemical shift perturbation is more clearly seen by superimposing the spectra of native α1PI and the non-covalent complex (Fig. 2B). The only resonances that show significant perturbation are those of P4 in the reactive center loop and Ala-284, which lies directly underneath P1 in the x-ray structures of both native α1PI and the non-covalent complex of α1PI-Pittsburgh with S195A trypsin. These are also the only two alanines that showed perturbation upon forming the non-covalent complex between α1PI-Pittsburgh and S195A trypsin and reflect direct contact perturbations resulting from interaction of the proteinase active site with residues in the immediate vicinity of the P1 residue. Critically, because the chemical shifts of alanines at P12, P11, and P9 shift by 3.4 to 4.5 ppm in the 15N dimension upon inserting into β-sheet A, yet are perturbed by at most 0.1 ppm here upon formation of the non-covalent complex, there can be no insertion of any residues of the reactive center loop into β-sheet A upon forming this complex. This is further demonstrated by the superpositioning of alanine resonances from alanines in the body of the serpin. Because these are also sensitive to the conformational change in the serpin body that accompanies expansion of β-sheet A to accommodate the RCL as a central strand, their lack of perturbation indicates un-equivocally that the serpin body has not changed conformation. Although the spectrum of the non-covalent complex shows both resonance broadening and chemical shift perturbation of two alanines, one at P4 and one underneath P1, each of which indicates that a complex was indeed formed under the conditions of the experiment, we wanted to independently demonstrate that the anhydroelastase prepared here bound to the RCL of α1PI. For this a competitive inhibition assay run under continuous assay conditions was carried out. α1PI was incubated with different concentrations of anhydroelastase in the presence of the chromogenic substrate succinyl-Ala-Ala-Ala-p-nitroaniline. Active elastase was then added and the hydrolysis of substrate monitored. As expected, the presence of anhydroelastase delayed the irreversible inhibition of elastase by α1PI in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 3), indicating a competition between anhydroelastase and elastase for the RCL of α1PI. Fitting of the data gave a KD of 33 ± 7 μm for the interaction between anhydroelastase and α1PI. Although this is significantly weaker than some other interactions between S195A serine proteinases and serpins (11Stratikos E. Gettins P.G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 453-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 30Futamura A. Stratikos E. Olson S.T. Gettins P.G.W. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13110-13119Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), it should be noted that human neutrophil elastase, rather than the porcine pancreatic elastase used both here and by Mellet and Bieth (24Mellet P. Bieth J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10788-10795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), is the in vivo target of α1PI. There are also other examples of cognate serpin-proteinase pairs with comparable affinities. The Covalent Complex of α1PI with Elastase—Because it is still the case that covalent complexes have been examined structurally for relatively few serpin-proteinase pairs, we also wanted to use the same NMR approach to characterize the covalent complex formed between α1PI and active elastase. This would be both the first example of a covalent serpin complex with elastase examined by a primary structural technique (NMR or x-ray crystallography) and serve as a comparison to the non-covalent complex described above. Covalent complex between 15N-Ala-labeled α1PI and active pancreatic elastase was generated and purified as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Because it is well documented that the proteinase in such serpin-proteinase complexes is much more susceptible to proteolytic cleavage by free proteinase (whether self or foreign) than is uncomplexed proteinase, care must be taken to ensure that the covalent complex remains intact by inhibiting any elastase that might form by deacylation of the covalent complex to yield active proteinase and cleaved serpin. This was accomplished by addition of a small excess of unlabeled α1PI to react with any regenerated elastase. SDS-PAGE of the purified covalent complex after initial purification and at the beginning and end of NMR data collection showed that negligible deacylation had occurred and, also importantly, that the covalent complex showed no evidence for proteolytic cleavage, which would have resulted in bands with mobility intermediate between that of the 71-kDa intact covalent complex and the 45-kDa cleaved α1PI (Fig. 4). The covalent complex of 15N-Ala α1PI with elastase gave a 1H-15N HSQC NMR spectrum very different from that of the equivalently labeled non-covalent complex (Fig. 2F). Resonance positions were very different from those of native α1PI and instead were mostly identical to those of cleaved, loop-inserted α1PI. This is shown clearly in Fig. 2E in which the spectra of the covalent complex and cleaved α1PI are overlaid. Importantly, the resonances of the RCL alanines P12, P11, and P9 show identical positions to those in cleaved α1PI, showing that the RCL has inserted into β-sheet A (note that P12 is only visible at a lower contour level than shown). This is corroborated by the similar positions of most of the remaining reporter alanines from the body of the serpin. Only alanines 183, 316, 325, and 332 and P4 in the RCL showed a somewhat altered chemical shift from cleaved α1PI. However, these are the same alanines that showed equivalent differences in chemical shift in the complex of α1PI-Pittsburgh with trypsin. In that case it was found that each of the alanines has a special position that makes them sensitive to additional perturbations in the complex compared with simple cleaved α1PI. Thus, alanines 316 and 325 are at the contact interface between trypsin and α1PI in the x-ray structure of this covalent complex, whereas alanines at positions 183 and 332 and P4 are in strands s3A, s5A, and s4A, respectively, of β-sheet A, close to the proteinase and may be sensing the effect of the mutual “crushing” of proteinase against the bottom of the serpin. The spectrum thus indicates that elastase forms a covalent complex with α1PI that involves full loop insertion and consequent alteration of the serpin conformation to resemble that of cleaved α1PI. Such a structure, involving translocation of the proteinase to the distal end of the serpin, is the same as was found by NMR spectroscopy and x-ray crystallography for the complex of α1PI with trypsin and suggests a common structural organization and mechanism for inhibition of serine proteinases by serpins. Rationalization of Earlier Conflicting Structure—Given that the results presented above on the non-covalent complex of anhydroelastase with α1PI clearly indicate a structure in which the anhydroproteinase perturbs only the residues of the RCL in the immediate vicinity of the scissile bond and in which there is no loop insertion into β-sheet A and hence no translocation of the proteinase, the question arises as to why Mellet and Bieth (24Mellet P. Bieth J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10788-10795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) came to the opposite conclusion using time-dependent fluorescence resonance energy transfer measurements. Their approach was to use anhydroelastase to which a fluorescein donor fluorophore had been covalently attached and α1PI to which a rhodamine acceptor fluorophore had been covalently attached. These species were then mixed in a stopped-flow apparatus, and the change in fluorescence was monitored with time. These authors found a two-phase change, with the first phase interpreted as initial association and the second as a concentration-independent step, representing translocation of the proteinase. Because anhydroelastase was used for this study, the second step was interpreted as a translocation prior to acylation. Two aspects of this study struck us as problematic. The first was that the kinetics of the two phases seen with anhydroelastase were identical to those reported earlier by the same authors, and by the same method, for formation of the covalent complex. The second was that the magnitude of the fluorescence change for the second phase, as a percentage of total fluorescence, was about 10%, whereas for formation of the covalent complex it was very much larger. A possible explanation for the results was that the preparation of anhydroelastase used by Mellet and Bieth (24Mellet P. Bieth J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10788-10795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) contained a significant proportion of active proteinase. Under such circumstances, the second phase of the fluorescence change would correspond to formation of covalent serpin-proteinase complex and consequently have identical kinetics to that found previously for formation of this complex. At the outset of the present study we therefore tested this possibility, both to see if this could be the explanation for the discrepancy and, if it were, to ensure that anhydroelastase used here for NMR studies was not contaminated with active proteinase. Anhydroelastase was prepared chemically by the same β-elimination method used by Mellet and Bieth (24Mellet P. Bieth J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10788-10795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In the present study, however, the crude product was fractionated over an α1PI-Sepharose column, and fractions were assayed immediately and after several weeks storage at 4 °C for enzymatic activity. Although both the initial crude material and all eluted fractions assayed immediately after elution had negligible enzymatic activity, it was found that the later eluting fractions (Fig. 5A, peak III) assayed after storage at 4 °C recovered activity in a solution assay and were capable of forming SDS-stable complexes with α1PI (Fig. 5B, lanes 8 and 9). In contrast, fractions eluting in the central part of peak II (Fig. 5A) did not regain activity over time and were incapable of forming an SDS-stable complex with α1PI. These fractions were judged to be pure anhydroelastase and were the ones used in the present study. Because Mellet and Bieth (24Mellet P. Bieth J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10788-10795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) used only the absence of enzymatic activity and the ability to bind to eglin c as criteria of purity, any elastase that was still the PMSF derivative and had not undergone β-elimination might have been included in their preparation. If used immediately, there would have been no ability to form covalent complex. However, if used some time later, hydrolysis of the PMS group would have regenerated functional elastase, as we found here for fractions eluting under peak III. Conclusions—In the present study we have used a sensitive primary structural approach (NMR) to examine the conformations and organization of both non-covalent and covalent complexes of the serpin α1PI with anhydroelastase and elastase, respectively. The structure of the non-covalent complex was found to be indistinguishable from those of other serpin-proteinase pairs and to involve simple docking of serpin and proteinase. Similarly, the covalent complex was found to be like other covalent serpin-proteinase complexes and to involve dramatic conformational change of the serpin and translocation of the proteinase from one pole to the other. These new structures significantly extend the currently very limited range of serpin-proteinase pairs for which primary structural information is available and support the idea that a common mechanism of serine proteinase inhibition is used by serpins. We have also identified a very plausible explanation for the earlier contradictory conclusion on the structure of the same non-covalent complex. We thank Dr. Steven Olson for helpful discussion and for comments on the manuscript and Dr. Klavs Dolmer for invaluable help with protein expression and purification."
https://openalex.org/W2133193988,"The strychnine-sensitive glycine receptor (GlyR) is a ligand-gated chloride channel composed of ligand binding α- and gephyrin anchoring β-subunits. To identify the secondary and quaternary structures of extramembraneous receptor domains, the N-terminal extracellular domain (α1-(1–219)) and the large intracellular TM3–4 loop (α1-(309–392)) of the human GlyR α1-subunit were individually expressed in HEK293 cells and in Escherichia coli. The extracellular domain obtained from E. coli expression was purified in its denatured form and refolding conditions were established. Circular dichroism and Fourier-transform-infrared spectroscopy suggested ∼25% α-helix and ∼48% β-sheet for the extracellular domain, while no α-helices were detectable for the TM3–4 loop. Size exclusion chromatography and sucrose density centrifugation indicated that isolated glycine receptor domains assembled into multimers of distinct molecular weight. For the extracellular domain from E. coli, we found an apparent molecular weight compatible with a 15mer by gel filtration. The N-terminal domain from HEK293 cells, analyzed by sucrose gradient centrifugation, showed a bimodal distribution, suggesting oligomerization of ∼5 and 15 subunits. Likewise, for the intracellular domain from E. coli, a single molecular mass peak of ∼49 kDa indicated oligomerization in a defined native structure. As shown by [3H]strychnine binding, expression in HEK293 cells and refolding of the isolated extracellular domain reconstituted high affinity antagonist binding. Cell fractionation, alkaline extraction experiments, and immunocytochemistry showed a tight plasma membrane association of the isolated GlyR N-terminal protein. These findings indicate that distinct functional characteristics of the full-length GlyR are retained in the isolated N-terminal domain.

The GlyR is a member of the ligand-gated ion channel superfamily, which also includes the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR), serotonin 5-HT3 receptor, as well as GABAA/C receptors. Members of this protein family share a quaternary structure of five subunits surrounding a central ion-conducting pore (4.Langosch D. Thomas L. Betz H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7394-7398Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 5.Hucho F. Weise C. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2001; 40: 3100-3116Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6.Laube B. Maksay G. Schemm R. Betz H. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2002; 23: 519-527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). The GlyR isoform prevalent in adult mammalian central nervous system is thought to comprise three α1-subunits and two structural β-subunits, which are thought to contribute to synaptic anchoring of receptor complexes. Generally, GlyR α-subunits possess the ability to form functional homomeric receptor channels. The subunit topology of the nAChR superfamily, as deduced from hydropathy analysis, consists of a large N-terminal extracellular domain, followed by four hydrophobic stretches of sufficient length to span the plasma membrane, and the extracellular C terminus (7.Betz H. Neuron. 1990; 5: 383-392Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Of all transmembrane regions, TM2 forms the inner lining of the central ion channel. A large cytosolic loop, flanked by TM3 and TM4, is thought to mediate intracellular interactions. Based on NMR studies of corresponding synthetic peptides, TM2 of the nAChR and GlyR has been demonstrated to be α-helical (8.Opella S.J. Marassi F.M. Gesell J.J. Valente A.P. Kim Y. Oblatt-Montal M. Montal M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 374-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 9.Tang P. Mandal P.K. Xu Y. Biophys. J. 2002; 83: 252-262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Several attempts have been made to elucidate the structure of the nAChR extracellular domain, which is widely seen as a prototype of the structural homologous GlyR. Recently, the chicken α7 extracellular domain was expressed in Xenopus oocytes (10.Wells G.B. Anand R. Wang F. Lindstrom J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 964-973Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), while a soluble fusion protein of the rat α7 nAChR N-terminal domain and maltose binding protein has been generated in Escherichia coli (11.Fischer M. Corringer P.J. Schott K. Bacher A. Changeux J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3567-3570Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In addition, the extracellular domain from the human muscle AChR α subunit was expressed as a soluble protein in the yeast Pichia pastoris (12.Psaridi-Linardaki L. Mamalaki A. Remoundos M. Tzartos S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26980-26986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), while the α7 nAChR extracellular domain fused to GST was expressed in E. coli and subsequently refolded (13.Tsetlin V.I. Dergousova N.I. Azeeva E.A. Kryukova E.V. Kudelina I.A. Shibanova E.D. Kasheverov I.E. Methfessel C. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 2801-2809Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In an alternative approach, the x-ray structure of a molluscan ACh binding protein was solved at atomic resolution (14.Brejc K. van Dijk W.J. Klaassen R.V. Schuurmans M. van Der Oost J. Smit A.B. Sixma T.K. Nature. 2001; 411: 269-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (1563) Google Scholar), and revealed structural similarity to the extracellular domain of nAChRs, as determined by electron microscopy (15.Unwin N. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 257: 586-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The extracellular domain of the GlyR α1-subunit comprises ∼50% of the entire subunit sequence, and contains determinants of ligand binding and subunit assembly (16.Breitinger H.-G. Becker C.-M. ChemBioChem. 2002; 3: 1042-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Six of eight key residues that form the putative intersubunit contact surface are located within the stretch of amino acid residues 1 to 100 (17.Griffon N. Buttner C. Nicke A. Kuhse J. Schmalzing G. Betz H. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4711-4721Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), a segment that was not associated with high affinity ligand binding (18.Grenningloh G. Rienitz A. Schmitt B. Methfessel C. Zensen M. Beyreuther K. Gundelfinger E.D. Betz H. Nature. 1987; 328: 215-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis studies suggest that glycine and strychnine bind to distinct, but overlapping, sites on recombinant receptors (16.Breitinger H.-G. Becker C.-M. ChemBioChem. 2002; 3: 1042-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In the GlyR α1-subunit, residues Ala101-Asn102, Gly160-Tyr161, Lys193, and Lys200-Thr204 represent determinants of ligand binding and agonist-antagonist discrimination. Recently, an alternative model of the GlyR topology was proposed, based on limited proteolysis and chemical modification of reconstituted α1 GlyR (19.Cascio M. Biopolymers. 2002; 66: 359-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). In particular, this alternative model suggested the presence of one or more membrane-associated stretches within the postulated extracellular N-terminal domain as well as a new topology of TM1 and TM3. Here, we describe the large scale recombinant expression and purification of the isolated GlyR α1 extracellular and intracellular domains. Strychnine affinity in the nanomolar range was retained for both, eukaryotic and refolded N-terminal domains. Surprisingly, the isolated extracellular domain showed a strong membrane association when expressed in HEK293 cells. Secondary structure analysis suggested a significant contribution of α-helices to the extracellular domain, while no α-helical structure was detectable in the intracellular TM3–4 loop. Our results show that other extracellular regions of the GlyR, such as the TM2–3 loop and the C terminus may be important for signal transduction and channel gating (16.Breitinger H.-G. Becker C.-M. ChemBioChem. 2002; 3: 1042-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 42.Xue H. Shi H. Tsang S.Y. Zheng H. Savva C.G. Sun J. Holzenburg A. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 312: 915-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), but are not essential for ligand binding. Construction of Vectors, Expression, and Purification of Fusion Proteins—Domains of interest were amplified by PCR using hsα1 DNA as template. Oligonucleotides were custom-synthesized (Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany). PCR primers contained appropriate restriction sites, allowing ligation into the pET30a (Novagen, Darmstadt, Germany) and pRK5 vectors. Successful mutations were verified by DNA sequencing (ABI Systems, Weiterscheidt, Germany). After transformation and expression, BL21 cells (Novagen, Darmstadt, Germany) were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 2.5 mm EDTA, pH 7.4, treated with lysozyme (0.1 mg/ml, 30 min, 0 °C) and sonicated (eight 10-s pulses) on ice. Sonification was repeated and the supernatant collected for native purification. For purification under denaturing conditions, the pellet was washed four times with 50 mm Tris-HCl, 2.5 mm EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, pH 8.2, and finally dissolved in 100 mm NaPi, 10 mm Tris-HCl, 8 m urea, pH 8.0. The denatured protein was applied to a Ni-agarose column (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), washed at pH 5.9 and eluted at pH 4.5. Native purification, performed on a Ni-agarose column, was achieved by washing and eluting with increasing imidazole concentrations. To avoid precipitation of these protein constructs in the presence of protease substrate buffers, tags were not removed. Refolding—A variety of folding conditions was tested, following published folding screens (20.Chen G.Q. Gouaux E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13431-13436Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 21.Heiring C. Muller Y.A. Protein Eng. 2001; 14: 183-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). After 2 h of incubation in denaturing buffer, 10 μl of the dissolved inclusion bodies (1 mg/ml) were added to 990 μl of folding screen solution. Samples were incubated overnight at 4 °C, dialyzed for 6 h against 100 ml of proteolysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0), concentrated and proteolyzed using subtilisin (1 μg/ml). The reaction was stopped after 100 min by adding phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 mm), and the samples were vacuum-dried. Western blot analysis was carried out for refolded protein samples before and after proteolysis. Large scale preparations (20 ml of denatured protein solution, 2–5 mg/ml) were made by stepwise dialysis: a first dialysis step against 1 liter of a 1:1 mixture of folding buffer and denaturing buffer was followed by repeatedly exchanging 30% of the solution with fresh folding buffer every 3 h. This step was repeated six times, followed by a final dialysis against pure folding buffer overnight. Mass Spectrometry—For matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) and surface enhanced laser desorption ionization (SELDI), protein samples were diluted to 2 mg/ml and mixed (1:1) with a CCA-Matrix (3-hydroxy-α-cyano-cinnamic-acid; saturated solution in 30% acetonitrile/0.1% trifluoroacetic acid), dotted onto a steel target, and air-dried. MALDI-TOF-MS analysis was performed on an Autoflex spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany) in the reflector mode while the SELDI analysis was carried out on a PBS II spectrometer (Ciphergen, Göttingen, Germany). Desorption of the samples was carried out using a nitrogen laser (337 nm). For the MALDI-TOF-MS analysis, the samples were accelerated with 19 kV after a delay of 3500 ns and several individual spectra of the respective samples were averaged. A peptide standard mix served as an external calibration. For SELDI analysis, time-of-flight spectra were generated by averaging 360 laser shots collected in the positive mode at laser intensity 259, detector sensitivity 10, and a focus lag time of 900 ns. Transfection of HEK 293 Cells, Alkaline Extraction, and Immunocytochemistry—HEK293 cells were cultured and transfected, and crude membrane fractions were prepared as described (22.Sontheimer H. Becker C.-M. Pritchett D.B. Schofield P.R. Grenningloh G. Kettenmann H. Betz H. Seeburg P.H. Neuron. 1989; 2: 1491-1497Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). For Western blot analysis (23.Kling C. Koch M. Saul B. Becker C.-M. Neuroscience. 1997; 78: 411-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) the monoclonal antibody mAb4a, a mouse monoclonal His-tag antibody (Novagen, Darmstadt, Germany) or a mouse monoclonal gephyrin antibody (BD Sciences, Heidelberg, Germany) were used, followed by a Cy5-coupled goat anti-mouse antibody gdMIgG-Cy5 (Dianova, Hamburg, Germany), and visualized on a Storm 860 Fluoro-imager (Molecular Dynamics, Krefeld, Germany). To test for membrane association, membrane preparations from transfected HEK293 cells (0.5 mg/ml) were incubated for 60 min at pH 7.4 or pH 11.0 at 4 °C and centrifuged (180,000 × g, 4 °C) for 90 min as described (24.Schmitt B. Knaus P. Becker C.-M. Betz H. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 805-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The pellets and supernatants were then subjected to Western blot analysis. HEK293 cells, grown on cover slips, were transferred to a 24-well plate 2 days after transfection. After fixation in paraformaldehyde for 10 min, cover slips were washed twice in PBS (1.5 mm KH2PO4, 6.5 mm Na2HPO4, 3 mm KCl, 137 mm NaCl), and blocked with 5% sheep serum for 30 min. For permeabilization, cells were treated with 0.1% Triton X-100. Primary (mAb4a, anti-Gephyrin) and secondary antibody, Cy3 goat anti-mouse F(ab)2 (Dianova, Hamburg, Germany) were applied for 60 min, every step followed by three washes with phosphate-buffered saline. Cover slips were transferred to slides and examined on a confocal microscope (Leica, Bensheim, Germany). [3H]Strychnine Binding—Different radioligand filtration assays were performed to determine [3H]strychnine binding of soluble protein (i, ii) and membrane-associated protein (iii): (i) Polyethylene glycol (PEG) precipitation: 15 μg of refolded protein, 0.13% γ-globulin, [3H]strychnine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Zaventem, Belgium; specific activity, 47.8 mCi/mol), and binding buffer B (25 mm KPi pH 7.4, 200 mm KCl) in the presence and absence of cold strychnine were incubated on ice for 30 min. PEG400 (15%) in buffer B was added and the mixture incubated on ice for another 30 min. The precipitated protein was applied to GF/C filter, soaked in 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and washed twice with cold buffer B. (ii) Adsorption on polyethyleneimine (PEI)-coated filters: Total cell extract preparation (50 μg) and [3H]strychnine in the presence or absence of cold strychnine were incubated on ice for 30 min, before applying to 0.3% PEI-soaked GF/B filter and washing twice with buffer B. (iii) Filter adsorption of membrane fractions: Protein obtained from membrane preparations was treated as described previously (23.Kling C. Koch M. Saul B. Becker C.-M. Neuroscience. 1997; 78: 411-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). For all methods, dried filters were subjected to scintillation counting (Roth, Karlsruhe, Germany). Binding data were fitted to Equation 1. dpmspec=Bmax11+KD/[Str](Eq. 1) Here, dpmspec represents specific binding expressed as scintillator counts (dpmspec was determined by subtracting unspecific counts from total counts), Bmax = total number of agonist binding sites, KD = binding constant, [Str] = [3H]strychnine concentration. For each concentration, unspecific binding was determined in the presence of 1 μm cold strychnine. Determinations were carried out in triplicate. Size Exclusion Chromatography and Sucrose Gradient Centrifugation—Sephacryl S400 (30 ml) and Sephacryl S200 (120 ml) columns were chosen to determine the native molecular weight of the GlyR extra- and intracellular domains, respectively. Calibration runs of marker proteins (Amersham Biosciences) were performed in triplicate on a BioLogicHR FPLC station (BioRad, München, Germany). Kav is defined by Equation 2, Kav=Ve-VoVt-Vo(Eq. 2) where Ve is the elution volume of the protein, Vo is the column void volume, and Vt is the total bed volume. Runs were performed at 4 °C in 50 mm KPi pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl for Sephacryl S200 and 50 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm NaCl for Sephacryl S400. For molecular weight determinations in a continuous sucrose gradient, 1 ml of total cell extract containing ∼5 mg of protein was layered on a continuous 10–40% sucrose gradient (26 ml) in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 25 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100 on top of a 60% sucrose cushion (3 ml). After centrifugation for 14 h in a Sorvall SW-28 rotor at 27,000 rpm GlyR antigen was quantified using a dot blot receptor assay (DORA). Sucrose fractions (1.5 ml) were collected, and 300 μl of the fraction was taken up in 300 μl of uptake buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2% sodium desoxycholate, 40% methanol, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA), and directly spotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane. GlyR content was then determined as described for Western blot analysis, mAb4a immune signal was quantified on a Storm860 fluoroimager. The following protein markers were used: cytochrome c (12.3 kDa, 1.83 Svedberg (S)), ovalbumin (43 kDa, 3.55 S), malate dehydrogenase (70 kDa, 4.32 S), lactic dehydrogenase (140 kDa, 6.95 S), and catalase (232 kDa, 11.3 S). CD Spectroscopy—Purified intra- and extracellular GlyR domains, expressed in E. coli and buffered in 10 mm KPi pH 7.4, were subjected to CD analysis. Measurements were performed on a JASCO-J810 spectrometer (JASCO, Groβ-Umstadt, Germany) in a 0.1-cm analytical cell. All spectra were baseline corrected by subtracting buffer runs. Eight individual scans were taken at room temperature in a range of 320 to 180 or 200 nm, with a 0.5-nm step size and averaged. Protein concentrations were determined by measuring the absorbance at 280 nm using the equation c = A280 nm/(ϵ × l). The path length l was 1 cm, the extinction coefficients (S_α1-(1–219), ϵ = 27550 m–1 cm–1; hsα1-(1–219), ϵ = 27550 m–1 cm–1; hsα1-(309–392), ϵ = 1400 m–1 cm–1) were calculated from the protein sequence (48.Gill S. Hippel P. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5010) Google Scholar). While α-helical structure elements give distinct CD spectra with negative maxima at 222 and 208 nm, spectra obtained from β-sheets have a broad negative maximum at 215 nm (25.Brahms S. Brahms J. J. Mol. Biol. 1980; 138: 149-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar, 26.Greenfield N.J. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 235: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). The left-handed type II polyproline (PPII) helix (26.Greenfield N.J. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 235: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar, 27.Schweimer K. Hoffmann S. Bauer F. Friedrich U. Kardinal C. Feller S.M. Biesinger B. Sticht H. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 5120-5130Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) yields spectra with an intense negative band at 204 nm. Here, the α-helix content was estimated using single wavelength methods based on the maxima at 222 and 208 nm (28.Greenfield N. Fasman G.D. Biochemistry. 1969; 8: 4108-4116Crossref PubMed Scopus (3296) Google Scholar, 29.Scholtz J.M. Qian H. York E.J. Stewart J.M. Baldwin R.L. Biopolymers. 1991; 31: 1463-1470Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). Additionally, a least square method was used to estimate secondary structure elements from a data base of reference CD spectra (30.Yang J.T. Wu C.S. Martinez H.M. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 130: 208-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (1722) Google Scholar). ATR-FTIR Spectroscopy—Attenuated total reflection (ATR) Fourier-transform-infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy was used to assess the relative amounts of secondary structure in the N-terminal extracellular domain and in the TM3–4 loop of the GlyR α1 subunit in aqueous solution. 20 μl of a solution containing 4–15 mg protein/ml in 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer pH 7.4 were placed on the silicon crystal of a Bruker Bio-ATR-II cell and 256 interferograms averaged at 2 cm–1 resolution with a Bruker Vector 22 spectrometer. Absorption spectra were obtained from the transformed interferograms using the pH-matched buffer without protein as the reference. The amide I and II absorption bands were fitted by gaussian bands corresponding to known absorption maxima of secondary structure elements (31.Bandekar J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1120: 123-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar, 32.Dong A. Huang P. Caughey W.S. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 3303-3308Crossref PubMed Scopus (1220) Google Scholar, 33.Krimm S. Bandekar J. Adv. Protein. Chem. 1986; 38: 181-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (2641) Google Scholar) using the Microcal Origin and OPUS software. The corresponding peak positions were restricted within 2 cm–1 to the frequencies at which minima occurred in the second derivative of the original spectra. Band widths were restricted to 30–32 cm–1. The integrals of the individual gaussian bands were taken as a relative measure of the type of secondary structure that corresponds with the center frequency of the resolved band. For analysis of GlyR α1-subunit extra- and intracellular domains, three different cDNA constructs were designed and expressed in both E. coli and in HEK293 cells. The vector pET30a, containing a variety of functional sites, was prepared for high yield protein expression in E. coli. In particular, a His-tag, a thrombin site, an S-tag (i.e. a 15-residue part of the ribonuclease S protein), and an enterokinase cleavage site preceded the fusion protein. To control for a potential interference with the S-tag, the truncated vector pET30aΔS-tag was designed, lacking the S-tag and the enterokinase cleavage site of the pET30a vector. The vector pRK5 was chosen for eukaryotic protein expression in HEK293 cells (34.Breitinger H.-G. Villmann C. Becker K. Becker C.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29657-29663Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Target proteins expressed in E. coli (pET30a and pET30aΔS-tag) included the extracellular domain without signal peptide and the large intracellular loop (Fig. 1, constructs 1, 2, 6). The influence of the His-tag on ligand binding was examined by expression of the extracellular domain in HEK293 cells (Fig. 1, constructs 3 and 4). Investigation of a potential membrane association of the isolated extracellular domain required a construct containing the signal peptide for incorporation into the plasma membrane compartments (Fig. 1, construct 5). Protein Expression, Purification, and Refolding of Pure GlyR Protein Constructs—For large scale production of pure protein, human GlyR α1 domains were expressed in E. coli. Initial affinity purification using maltose binding protein fused to the target protein proved to be ineffective due to degradation of the receptor polypeptide during factor Xa treatment (not shown). Therefore, a His-tagged fusion protein was engineered for recombinant expression, followed by purification on Ni-NTA agarose. When the large intracellular loop was expressed in E. coli, a soluble protein was obtained which was efficiently purified under native conditions using a Ni-agarose column. In contrast, E. coli expression of the extracellular domain almost exclusively resulted in inclusion body formation. As shown for other receptors, e.g. the N-terminal domain of the α7 AChR (13.Tsetlin V.I. Dergousova N.I. Azeeva E.A. Kryukova E.V. Kudelina I.A. Shibanova E.D. Kasheverov I.E. Methfessel C. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 2801-2809Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), proteins from inclusion bodies may properly refold, but the refolding procedure does not necessarily result in a high percentage of correctly folded protein (35.Rudolph R. Lilie H. Faseb J. 1996; 10: 49-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar). While we made considerable efforts to avoid inclusion body formation by testing different E. coli strains and varying the expression conditions, we never obtained sufficient amounts of the target protein in its soluble form (not shown). Nevertheless, expression in form of inclusion bodies yielded high amounts of almost pure N-terminal protein, which was further purified on a Ni-NTA column under denaturing conditions. Refolding conditions were established following a modified protocol of Heiring and Muller (21.Heiring C. Muller Y.A. Protein Eng. 2001; 14: 183-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) (Table I). Since correctly folded protein is expected to be more stable against degradation than a non- or incorrectly folded structure, resistance to a protease digest served as an indicator of correct folding (21.Heiring C.

Refolded protein, prepared by 100-fold dilution into folding buffer, therefore, was treated with subtilisin and subjected to Western blot analysis (Fig. 2). Proper protein refolding was assessed by comparing signal intensities of intact full-length protein and degradation products. Large scale preparation of pure protein was carried out by stepwise dialysis against refolding buffer. Under these conditions, best refolding was obtained with 50 mm Tris-HCl and 7 μm CuCl2 (Fig. 2, lane 16). Several other conditions resulted in efficient refolding during the initial test analysis (Fig. 2, lanes 8, 12, and 13), but were hampered by precipitation of the desired protein during final large-scale preparations. This appeared to be due to elevated salt concentrations in combination with protein concentrations that were 2000–5000-fold higher than under the initial test conditions. High purity and integrity of the GlyR α1 fragments was verified by Coomassie gel staining (Fig. 3A) and Western blot analysis (Fig. 3B) using mAb4a for the extracellular domain and His-tag antibody for the intracellular domain. Mass spectrometry analysis by MALDI-TOF-MS and SELDI of pure protein constructs from E. coli verified the molecular weights of 12,115 kDa for the intracellular domain and 30,685 kDa for the N-terminal construct Sα1_(1–219) (Fig. 3C). All N-terminal constructs and the full-length receptor showed significant levels of expression in HEK293 cells (Fig. 3B).Table IRefolding screen for the GlyR extracellular domainNo.BufferSaltCation/no cationPEGDetergentChaotr.Polar/non polar addit.Redox comp.1Tris-HClHighEDTA+---DTT2MESLowMg-/CaCl2-LM+-GSSG/GSH3MESLowEDTA+-+Sucr/argGSSG/GSH4Tris-HClHighMg-/CaCl2-LM-Sucr/argDTT5Tris-HClHighMg-/CaCl2+LM+Sucr/argGSSG/GSH6Tris-HClLowEDTA+LM+SucroseDTT7Tris-HClLowMg-/CaCl2--+ArginineDTT8MESHighEDTA+LM-ArginineGSSG/GSH9MESHighMg-/CaCl2+-+SucroseDTT10Tris-HClLowEDTA-LM-SucroseGSSG/GSH11Tris-HClLowMg-/CaCl2+--ArginineGSSG/GSH12MESHighEDTA-LM+ArginineDTT13Tris-HClHighEDTA--+-GSSG/GSH14MESLowMg-/CaCl2+LM--DTT15MESLowEDTA---Sucr/argDTT16Tri"
https://openalex.org/W2023880638,"We have cloned a novel γ-aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) receptor γ2 subunit variant named γ2XL. γ2XL contains an alternatively spliced exon, resulting in the addition of 40 amino acids to the N-terminal extracellular domain between Ser171 and Tyr172. We show that γ2XL failed to localize to the cell surface when it was coexpressed with the α2 and β1 subunits in human embryonic kidney 293 cells. Expression of γ2XL in 293 cells suppressed GABAA receptor binding in a dose-dependent manner by preventing GABAA receptor cell-surface localization. We also generated a γ2 mutant with Ser171 and Tyr172 converted to glycine and threonine, respectively. We demonstrate that this mutant has a significantly lower affinity for the α2 and β1 subunits and failed to reach the cell surface when coexpressed with these subunits. Together, our results indicate that Ser171 and Tyr172 in the γ2 subunit constitute a critical motif. When this motif is disrupted by insertion of the alternative exon, access of the γ2 subunit to the cell surface is prevented.

Heterologous expression of recombinant GABAA receptor subunits in cultured cells shows that the combination of α and β subunits is sufficient for creating the GABA-binding sites and for eliciting GABA-gated Cl- currents (7.Nayeem N. Green T.P. Martin I.L. Barnard E.A. J. Neurochem. 1994; 62: 815-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar).

The γ2 subunit has been identified as two alternatively spliced variants, γ2L and γ2S. γ2L contains an alternative exon that encodes 8 amino acids inserted in the intracellular loop between the third and fourth transmembrane domains. Patterns of γ2L and γ2S expression are overlapping but distinct (16.Araki T. Sato M. Kiyama H. Manabe Y. Tohyama M. Neuroscience. 1992; 47: 45-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 17.Gutierrez A. Khan Z.U. De Blas A.L. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 7168-7179Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Genetically engineered mice bearing only γ2S exhibit increased affinity for benzodiazepines and show increased sensitivity in behavioral responses to these agonists (18.Quinlan J.J. Firestone L.L. Homanics G.E. Pharmacol. Biochem. Behav. 2000; 66: 371-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). This work describes the cloning and characterization of a third γ2 subunit splice variant, γ2XL. This variant possesses an additional alternative exon that encodes a stretch of 40 amino acids inserted in the N-terminal extracellular domain, but lacks the 8-amino acid alternative exon found in γ2L. γ2XL was localized intracellularly when coexpressed with the α2 and β1 subunits in 293 cells. Overexpression of γ2XL decreased ligand binding to the GABAA receptor composed of the α2, β1, and γ2 subunits. We further identified that 2 amino acids in the γ2 subunit (Ser171 and Tyr172) are essential for subunit interaction and cell-surface expression. Coincidently, these 2 amino acids directly flank the inserted alternative exon and are extremely conserved among members of the GABAA receptor subunit superfamily. Identification of a novel exon inserted in the highly conserved motif in the γ2 subunit will further our understanding of the mechanisms that control GABAA receptor assembly and membrane trafficking. Cloning of α2, β1, γ2, and γ2XL Receptor Subunits—First-strand cDNAs were synthesized with StrataScript reverse transcriptase (Stratagene) using an mRNA pool prepared from 168 representative normal and diseased human tissues. These tissues covered all the major organs of the human anatomy. Total RNA was extracted from each tissue sample using TRIzol (Invitrogen), followed by mRNA isolation using Oligotex (QIAGEN Inc.) and DNase treatment. The integrity of mRNA was checked by agarose gel electrophoresis prior to pooling. GABAA receptor γ2 subunit cDNA (NCBI Nucleotide Database RefSeq NM_000816) 2Available at www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Entrez/Nucleotide and γ2XL were cloned using a PCR primer pair flanking the entire open reading frame (5′-GCGATGAGTTCGCCAAATATATG and 5′-CATCTCTCCATGAGACTCAGTGAATAAG). PCR products were cloned into the pDrive cloning vector (QIAGEN Inc.), and the cDNA insert size from ∼200 randomly selected recombinant clones was determined by PCR amplification. Representative clones with subtle differences in molecular mass were completely sequenced. γ2XL was identified by alignment of cloned cDNA sequences with the human γ2 subunit genomic DNA (RefSeq NT_023133.11) using the software SIM4 (19.Florea L. Hartzell G. Zhang Z. Rubin G.M. Miller W. Genome Res. 1998; 8: 967-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). α2 (RefSeq NM_000807) and β1 (RefSeq _000812) subunit cDNAs were cloned by reverse transcription-PCR using primers 5′-GGCGGTGATGAAGACAAAATTGAA and 5′-GATAACATGGGTCTCAATTCAAGG and primers 5′-GTAATGTGGACAGTACAAAATCGAGAG and 5′-CGCTGTTGGGGACCTGTAAG, respectively. All cloned cDNAs were verified by complete insert sequencing. Plasmid Constructs—To prepare DNA constructs for GABAA receptor-ligand binding assays, α2, β1, γ2, and γ2XL cDNA inserts were removed from the pDrive cloning vector by restriction digestion and subcloned into the pCEP4 expression vector (Invitrogen). To facilitate protein detection, epitope tags were added to the receptor subunits by PCR. To add a Myc-His tag to the C termini of γ2 and γ2XL, the cDNAs were amplified by PCR using primers 5′-GTACAAGCTTACCATGAGTTCGCCAAATATATGGAGCACA and 5′-ATCCTCGAGCAGGTAGAGGTAGGAGACCCAATAGAC and cloned into the HindIII/XhoI sites of the pcDNA3.1/Myc-His A plasmid (Invitrogen). To enhance detection, a second Myc tag was introduced between amino acids 8 and 9 of mature γ2 and γ2XL by PCR. The cDNA was amplified in two pieces using primers 5′-ATCAAGCTTACCATGGGTTCGCCAAATATATGGAGCACAGGA and 5′-ATCGAATTCATAGTCATCATCAGATTTCTG and primers 5′-ATGAATTCGAACAAAAACTCATCTCAGAAGAGGATCTGGATTATGCTTCTAACAAAACATGGGTC and 5′-ATCCTCGAGCAGGTAGAGGTAGGAGACCCAATAGAC. The PCR fragments were digested with HindIII and EcoRI or with EcoRI and XhoI and cloned back into the HindIII/XhoI sites of the pcDNA3.1/Myc-His A plasmid. We constructed α2 and β1 subunits with a C-terminal V5 tag using PCR. For α2-V5, PCR was performed with primers 5′-GTAAAGCTTACCATGGGACAAAATTGAACATCTAGAACATC and 5′-GTCTGGATCCTCACGTAGAATCGAGACCGAGGAGAGGGTTAGGGATGGCTTACCCCAAGGACTGACCCCTAATAC. For β1-V5, PCR was performed with primers 5′-GTACAAGCTTACCATGGGGACAGTACAAAATCGAGAGAGTCTG and 5′-GTCTGGATCCTCACGTAGAATCGAGACCGAGGAGAGGGTTAGGGATAGGCTTACCCCAGTGTACATAGTAAAGCCAATAGAC. The PCR products were digested with HindIII and BamHI and cloned into pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen). The γ2(S171G/Y172T) and γ2(S171G/Y172T)-Myc constructs were prepared from γ2XL and γ2XL-Myc, respectively, by deleting the alternative exon using PCR. The coding sequence of γ2XL was amplified using primers 5′-ATCAAGCTTACCATGGGTTCGCCAAATATATGGAGCACAGGA and 5′-GACTGGTACCGGAGAACTCCAAGGGGCAGGA and primers 5′-GACTGGTACCGGCTATCCACGTGAAGAAATTGTT and 5′-ATCCTCGAGCAGTCAGAGGTAGGAGACCCAATAGAC. The PCR products were digested with HindIII and KpnI or with KpnI and XhoI and cloned into the HindIII/XhoI sites of the pcDNA3.1 plasmid to introduce the S171G and Y172T mutations at the KpnI restriction site. Quantitative PCR (Q-PCR)—mRNAs were isolated from 18 human brain tissues using Oligotex. Two human brain total RNAs were purchased (Stratagene). Following DNase treatment, the mRNA samples were verified by Q-PCR to be free of detectable genomic DNA contamination. First-strand cDNA was generated using StrataScript reverse transcriptase. Q-PCR primers and probes were designed using Primer Express Version 1.5 (Applied Biosystems). The γ2XL primer/probe set lies within the alternative exon to yield a 63-bp amplicon (primers 5′-GTGGTGTGATCTCGGCTCACT and 5′-GCCAAGGTGGGAGGATCAG and probe 5′-AGCCTTCGCTTCTGG). The control primer/probe set was selected from exons 7 and 8 of the γ2 subunit gene, which flanks a 6792-bp intron, to yield a 100-bp amplicon (primers 5′-TGTCGTCCTATCCTGGGTGTCT and 5′-TGCTGAGGGTGGTCATTGTC and probe 5′-TTCCAGCCAGAACAT). Q-PCRs were performed for 50 cycles on an ABI7900 (Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The threshold cycle values were determined by the ABI software default ΔRn vAlue. Cell Cultures and Transfection—Human embryonic kidney 293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) and transfected using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. Transfection was performed either in 10-cm dishes with 24 μg/dish plasmid DNA or in 6-well plates with 5 μg/well plasmid DNA. Radioligand Binding—Cells were harvested 48 h after cotransfection with equal amounts of the α2, β1, and either γ2 or γ2XL constructs. To prepare the membrane fraction, cells were homogenized in ice-cold wash buffer (10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7. 2) by passage through a 27-gauge needle. Cell homogenates were washed by two centrifugation-resuspension cycles in 1 ml of ice-cold wash buffer. Cell homogenates were centrifuged at 4 °C for 60 min at 15,000 × g. The pellets were resuspended in 600 μl of ice-cold assay buffer (10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7. 2, and 100 mm potassium chloride) and centrifuged at 500 × g for 5 min. The supernatant, which contained the enriched membrane fraction, was collected and stored at -80 °C after the protein concentration was determined. For radioligand binding, 150-200 μg of membrane protein preparation was incubated on ice for 60 min with 10 nm [3H]Ro 15-1788 (78 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) or 10 nm [3H]muscimol (28.5 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in a total volume of 200 μl. Unbound ligands were removed at the end of the incubation by rapid filtration on Whatman GF/C filters with a Model 1225 sampling manifold (Millipore Corp.). The filters were washed once with 15 ml of ice-cold assay buffer, and the filter-retained radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Protein Analysis—Cells were transfected with tagged or untagged GABAA receptor subunit constructs and harvested 48 h later. Nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA)-agarose beads (QIAGEN Inc.) were used for purifying His6-tagged proteins under native conditions following the manufacturer's instructions. Purified His6-tagged proteins were eluted and separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels for immunoblotting using anti-Myc or anti-V5 antibody (both from Invitrogen). Antibodies were diluted 1:5000. Immunocytochemistry—Transfected cells plated on poly-l-lysine (25 μg/ml)-coated coverslips were fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) 24 h after transfection. When membrane permeabilization was required, cells were treated with PBS and 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 for 10 min following fixation. Cells were washed three times with PBS and blocked for 10 min in PBS containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 0.5% bovine serum albumin. Anti-Myc antibody (diluted 1:100) was applied for 1 h, followed by three washes with PBS. Fluorescein-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (diluted 1:100; Calbiochem) was applied for 1 h. Coverslips were washed three times with PBS, mounted on glass slides, and examined using a fluorescent microscope (Carl Zeiss, Inc.). Cloning of a Novel Splice Variant of the γ2 Subunit Gene—A novel GABAA receptor γ2 subunit variant was cloned (submitted to the GenBank™/EBI Data Bank with accession number CD014120) using reverse transcription-PCR with forward and reverse primers that flank the open reading frame of the human GABAA receptor γ2 subunit cDNA (NCBI Nucleotide Database RefSeq NM_000816). This variant is identical to γ2S, except that it contains an exon insertion of 120 bp between exons 5 and 6 of the γ2 subunit gene (Fig. 1). This additional exon encodes 40 amino acids that are inserted in the N-terminal extracellular domain between Ser171 and Tyr172 of the mature γ2 subunit (Fig. 2). This novel γ2 subunit variant was named as γ2XL. A BLAST search against the NCBI Alu Database 3Available at www.ncbi.nlm.nib.gov/pub/jmc/Alu/. identified the presence of an Alu-J element in the antisense orientation (20.Deininger P.L. Batzer M.A. Genome Res. 2002; 12: 1455-1465Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 21.Roy-Engel A.M. Salem A.H. Oyeniran O.O. Deininger L. Hedges D.J. Kilroy G.E. Batzer M.A. Deininger P.L. Genome Res. 2002; 12: 1333-1344Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) within the 2572-bp γ2 subunit intron 5 sequence (see Fig. 1). Part of the 5′-end Alu-J sequence (120 bp) is spliced to become the alternative exon of γ2XL. Reverse transcription-PCR experiments using a forward primer specific to the alternative exon and a reverse primer against exon 6 (see Fig. 1) further revealed the existence of this Alu-derived alternative exon in cynomolgus monkey γ2 subunit mRNA transcripts (data not shown). A BLAST search against available intron 5 sequences derived from other GABAA receptor subunit superfamily members confirmed the presence of an intronic Alu in α1, α3, α5, β1, γ1, ρ1, and π subunit genes, accounting for about half of the intron 5 sequences analyzed (data not shown).Fig. 2Protein sequence alignment. Shown is the alignment of the γ2 and γ2XL precursor sequences. The putative signal peptide (Sp) and transmembrane domains (Tm) are indicated. Note that Tyr172 is converted to tryptophan as a result of the exon insertion in γ2XL.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) A Weak Donor Splice Site Flanks the Alternative Exon—Pre-mRNA splicing is a complex process that begins with the interactions between splice site elements and the spliceosome components (22.Smith C.W. Valcarcel J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 381-388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (761) Google Scholar). We examined the splice site elements in intron 5 (between exons 5 and 6) of the γ2 subunit gene and found a perfect lariat branch point and acceptor elements for the alternative exon (Fig. 3). The 3′-end of the alternative exon is flanked by a “GC” nucleotide pair, which is an intrinsically weak donor in pre-mRNA splicing due to a mismatched base pair C (instead of a T) in the interaction between the donor and U1 small nuclear RNA (23.Thanaraj T.A. Clark F. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 2581-2593Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). RNA Expression—mRNA expression of γ2XL in brain was quantitated by Q-PCR using mRNAs from different human brain regions. PCR primers used for detecting γ2XL were selected within the alternative exon and will amplify only γ2XL. PCR primers used for detecting the γ2 subunit were selected from exons 7 and 8 of γ2 (a region also shared by γ2XL) and will therefore detect γ2, including γ2S and γ2L (24.Whiting P. McKernan R.M. Iversen L.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9966-9970Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar), and γ2XL. Expression of γ2XL was detected in all brain mRNAs tested (Fig. 4). However, the levels of γ2XL expression were much lower than those of γ2 subunit expression, as reflected by the significantly (∼10-fold) higher threshold cycle values. γ2XL expression was lowest in hippocampus and was lower in fetal brain than in adult brain (Fig. 4). Expression of Recombinant γ2XL in Human Cells—A Myc-His tag was fused in-frame to the 3′-end of γ2 or γ2XL to facilitate protein detection. A second Myc tag was inserted between amino acids 9 and 10 of the mature proteins to enhance the signals detected. As shown in Fig. 5, anti-Myc antibody detected γ2XL expressed in human embryonic kidney 293 cells as a band of ∼54 kDa, which is slightly larger than the γ2 subunit. γ2XL with Myc tags at both the 5′- and 3′-ends gave a much stronger signal than did γ2XL with a single 3′-end Myc tag. The γ2 and γ2XL constructs with two Myc tags were therefore chosen for immunoblotting and immunocytochemistry assays throughout this study. Cells Coexpressing α2, β1, and γ2XL Fail to Bind Benzodiazepines—GABAA receptor subunits were cotransfected into 293 cells. Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection, and membrane fractions were prepared. The membrane preparation from cells cotransfected with the α2 and β1 subunits bound [3H]muscimol, a GABA agonist, but did not bind [3H]Ro 15-1788, a benzodiazepine antagonist (Fig. 6, A and B). The membrane preparation from cells cotransfected with the α2, β1, and γ2 subunits bound both [3H]muscimol and [3H]Ro 15-1788 (Fig. 6, A and B). These results are consistent with published results that the combination of α and β subunits is sufficient for creating the GABA-binding sites and that a third component, the γ subunit, is required for formation of the benzodiazepine-binding sites (12.Connolly C.N.

Gorrie G.H. Hosie A. Smart T.G. Moss S.J. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 1297-1306Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the membrane preparation from cells coexpressing α2, β1, and γ2XL did not bind [3H]Ro 15-1788 and bound to a lower amount of [3H]muscimol (Fig. 6, A and B). Overexpression of γ2XL Suppresses GABAA Receptor Binding—To further examine the effect of γ2XL on GABAA receptor binding, we cotransfected 293 cells with the GABAA receptor α2, β1, and γ2 subunits together with increasing amounts of γ2XL. The membrane preparation from cells cotransfected with the α2, β1, and γ2 subunits bound [3H]Ro 15-1788 (Fig. 7A) and [3H]muscimol (Fig. 7B). However, the binding of both [3H]Ro 15-1788 and [3H]muscimol decreased progressively with increasing amounts of γ2XL (Fig. 7, A and B). To demonstrate that the level of γ2XL protein expression corresponds to the amount of γ2XL cDNA transfected, cells were transfected with Myc-His-tagged γ2XL (γ2XL-Myc), and the expressed protein was purified using Ni-NTA-agarose beads. Increased expression of the γ2XL-Myc protein was demonstrated in cells transfected with greater amounts of γ2XL-Myc cDNA (Fig. 7C). Failure of γ2XL to Localize to the Cell Surface—Assembly and cell-surface expression of GABAA receptor αβ or αβγ heteromers have previously been described (12.Connolly C.N. Kittler J.T. Thomas P.

Moss S.J. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 1297-1306Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our observation that overexpression of γ2XL decreased GABAA receptor binding (Fig. 7) indicates that perhaps the presence of an additional exon insertion in the γ2 subunit may have caused a conformational change to the GABAA receptor on the cell surface. Alternatively, the γ2 subunit variant may have affected the membrane trafficking of the GABAA receptor and interfered with its localization to the cell surface. To test these hypotheses, γ2-Myc or γ2XL-Myc was coexpressed with the α2 and β1 subunits in 293 cells. Receptor expression was analyzed by immunofluorescence staining using anti-Myc antibody. Cells coexpressing α2β1γ2-Myc generated robust cell-surface staining (Fig. 8A). However, no immunostaining could be detected on the surface of cells coexpressing α2β1γ2XL-Myc (Fig. 8C). When the cell membrane was permeabilized, both transfected cells showed a strong perinuclear staining typical of an endoplasmic reticulum staining pattern (Fig. 8, B and D). The failure of the γ2XL-Myc protein to localize to the cell surface, together with the decreased GABAA receptor binding of both [3H]Ro 15-1788 and [3H]muscimol when increasing amounts of γ2XL protein were expressed, indicates that γ2XL is capable of suppressing the cell-surface expression of the GABAA receptor. Identification of Critical Amino Acids That Mediate γ2 Subunit Cell-surface Expression—We were interested in identifying amino acids in the γ2 subunit that are responsible for its cell-surface expression. When the alternative exon was deleted from γ2XL, we inserted a KpnI restriction site at the deletion junction. This led to the substitution of Ser171 with glycine and Tyr172 with threonine, resulting in the γ2 mutant γ2(S171G/Y172T) (Fig. 9; see also Fig. 2). Cells expressing the α2 and β1 subunits and Myc-His-tagged γ2(S171G/Y172T) showed only perinuclear immunostaining in permeabilized cells, and no cell-surface staining could be detected (Fig. 8, E and F). Ligand binding assays further confirmed that the membrane preparation from cells coexpressing α2β1γ2(S171G/Y172T) was able to bind [3H]muscimol, but failed to bind [3H]Ro 15-1788 (data not shown). These results demonstrate that Ser171 and Tyr172 are necessary for the cell-surface expression of the γ2 subunit. Interestingly, a search against the GenBank™/EBI Data Bank using the BLASTP program showed that Ser171 and Tyr172 of the γ2 subunit are extremely conserved among the members of the GABAA receptor subunit superfamily (Fig. 9). Receptor Subunit Interaction—The interaction of GABAA receptor subunits has been demonstrated previously (25.Connolly C.N. Krishek B.J. McDonald B.J. Smart T.G. Moss S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 89-96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 27.Klausberger T. Ehya N. Fuchs K. Fuchs T. Ebert V. Sarto I. Sieghart W. J. Biol.

Neurosci. 2001; 21: 9124-9133Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To study the interaction of γ2XL with other receptor subunits, we tagged the α2 and β1 subunits with a V5 epitope at the C terminus. Subunits with or without a tag were coexpressed in 293 cells as detailed in Fig. 10A. Subunit complexes in cell lysates were purified using Ni-NTA-agarose beads under native conditions and separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Immunoblots were probed with anti-Myc or anti-V5 antibody. The results in Fig. 10A show that anti-Myc antibody detected expression of γ2-Myc and γ2XL-Myc in cotransfected cells. However, the levels of γ2XL-Myc were lower than those of γ2-Myc. This may reflect a difference in protein stability or partial blockage of the His6 tag in γ2XL as a result of the exon insertion. The interaction of γ2-Myc with α2-V5 and β1-V5 was detected by anti-V5 antibody (Fig. 10, A and B, lower panels). Subunit association among γ2XL-Myc, α2-V5, and β1-V5 was also demonstrated, although the affinity of binding appeared to be lower than that among γ2-Myc, α2-V5, and β1-V5, indicating that the exon insertion in γ2XL negatively affects the receptor subunit association. The interaction of Myc-His-tagged γ2(S171G/Y172T) with α2-V5 and β1-V5 was also studied in cells coexpressing these subunits. The results show that, similar to γ2XL-Myc, γ2(S171G/Y172T)-Myc bound significantly less α2-V5 and β1-V5 than did γ2-Myc (Fig. 10B). These results clearly demonstrate that Ser171 and Tyr172 are critical for subunit interaction with the α2 and β1 subunits. Two splice variants of the GABAA receptor γ2 subunit, γ2L and γ2S, have previously been cloned and extensively characterized. We cloned a third GABAA receptor γ2 subunit variant, γ2XL. γ2XL contains an additional exon that is derived from an Alu element. Interestingly, this Alu-derived exon is also spliced in monkey γ2 subunit mRNA, as detected by reverse transcription-PCR (data not shown). We also found the presence of this Alu element in intron 5 sequences of about half of the GABAA receptor subunit superfamily members. Alu elements are short interspersed sequences that amplify in primate genomes (20.Deininger P.L. Batzer M.A. Genome Res. 2002; 12: 1455-1465Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 29.Mighell A.J. Markham A.F. Robinson P.A.

Genome Res. 2002; 12: 1060-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). Because Alu elements are only found in primate genomes, Alu-derived exons might contribute to some of the characteristically unique features of primates (32.Lev-Maor G. Sorek R. Shomron N. Ast G. Science. 2003; 300: 1288-1291Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Indeed, Alu exonization not only contributes to protein diversity and genome evolution, but has been shown to cause human genetic diseases (32.Lev-Maor G. Sorek R. Shomron N. Ast G.

For example, a C-to-G single nucleotide mutation that activates a donor splice site causes constitutive splicing of the intronic Alu in the ornithine δ-aminotransferase gene and inactivates it. This results in autosomal recessive chorioretinal degeneration caused by deficiency of ornithine δ-aminotransferase (34.Mitchell G.A. Labuda D. Fontaine G. Saudubray J.M. Bonnefont J.P. Lyonnet S.

To determine the physiological significance of the γ2XL splice variant, we examined its tissue expression in human brain. Our Q-PCR results show that the abundance of γ2XL transcripts was drastically lower than that of γ2 transcripts in all human brain regions tested. In analyzing the splice site elements in the intron between exons 5 and 6 of the γ2 subunit gene, we found a perfect branch point and acceptor site consensus for splicing of the alternative exon, but an intrinsically weak donor site (GC) that flanks the 3′-end of the alternative exon (22.Smith C.W. Valcarcel J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 381-388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (761) Google Scholar, 23.Thanaraj T.A. Clark F. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 2581-2593Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). It has been reported that ∼99% of the splice sites are the GT-AG donor-acceptor type. The major variant is the GC-AG type, accounting for ∼0.5% of the total donor sites (37.International Human Genome Sequencing ConsortiumNature. 2001; 409: 860-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (18200) Google Scholar). GC is a weak donor in pre-mRNA splicing because of a mismatched base pair C in the interaction between the donor and U1 small nuclear RNA (23.Thanaraj T.A. Clark F. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 2581-2593Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). This discovery explains, from a molecular basis, why the alternative exon is rarely included in the mature γ2 transcripts. However, it remains to be explored if there is a cell type- or disease-specific factor that compensates for such a weak donor and that promotes inclusion of the alternative exon in γ2 transcripts. For example, a neuron-specific RNA-binding protein (Nova) has been found to promote the inclusion of the 8-amino acid miniexon in γ2Ltranscripts (38.Dredge B.K. Darnell R.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 4687-4700Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Our results show that γ2XL failed to be expressed on the cell surface when coexpressed with the α2 and β1 subunits. If overexpressed, γ2XL decreased the cell-surface number of GABAA receptors available for binding both [3H]muscimol (GABA site) and [3H]Ro 15-1788 (benzodiazepine site) ligands. The mechanisms by which γ2XL inhibits binding of these ligands remain to be elucidated. γ2XL may block the cell-surface expression of the GABAA receptor by its intracellular association with the α2 and β1 subunits or by sequestering factors crucial to the subunit assembly and membrane trafficking of the receptor (39.Kneussel M.

Wisden W. Triller A. Smart T.G. Moss S.J. Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 908-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Indeed, the γ2 subunit has been found to bind the GABAA receptor-associated protein, a factor involved in GABAA receptor trafficking (42.Wang H. Bedford F.K. Brandon N.J. Moss S.J. Olsen R.W. Nature. 1999; 397: 69-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar, 43.Stangler T. Mayr L.M. Willbold D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13363-13366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). This work has focused on the effect of γ2XL on the α2 and β1 subunits, and the functional relationship of γ2XL with other GABAA receptor subunits (e.g. the more dominant α1 and β2 subunits) remains to be characterized. We identified 2 amino acid residues (Ser171 and Tyr172) essential for γ2 subunit function. Interestingly, these 2 residues not only directly flank the inserted alternative exon, but also are extremely conserved among the members of the GABAA receptor subunit superfamily. Substitution of these amino acids in the γ2 subunit with Gly171 and Thr172, respectively, significantly decreased the association of the heteromeric subunit with the α2 and β1 subunits and prevented its cell-surface expression. It was previously reported that a γ2 mutant with Tyr172 converted to serine (Y172S) had little effect on the binding of [3H]Ro 15-1788 when coexpressed with the α1 and β2 subunits (5.Whiting P.J. McAllister G. Vassilatis D. Bonnert T.P. Heavens R.P. Smith D.W. Hewson L. O'Donnell R. Rigby M.R. Sirinathsinghji D.J. Marshall G. Thompson S.A. Wafford K.A. Vasilatis D. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 5027-5037Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Perhaps, of the 2 identified residues, only Ser171 is indispensable. Alternatively, Ser171 and Tyr172 may be important only for the function of and association with α2 and β1, the subunits used for characterization in this study. In summary, this is the first report to identify a novel splice variant of the GABAA receptor γ2 subunit with an Alu-derived alternative exon inserted between 2 critical amino acids, Ser171 and Tyr172. When these 2 amino acids were mutated or disrupted by insertion of the alternative exon, access of the γ2 subunit to the cell surface was prevented. Identification of such amino acids essential for γ2 subunit function will enhance our understanding of the structure-function relationship of γ2 in the context of the subunit association and cell-surface expression of GABAA receptors.

The transfection efficiency was measured by co-transfection of pSV-β-galactosidase control vector (1 μg) followed by β-galactosidase assay, as previously described (26.Quinto I. Mallardo M. Baldassarre F. Scala G. Englund G. Jeang K.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17567-17572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Similarly, COS-1 cells were transfected with pMA239 (1 μg) in presence of pNLIκB-αS32/36A (5 μg), pNLIκB-antisense (5 μg), or pRc/CMV (5 μg). The production of SIV virions was measured by p27 ELISA assay in culture supernatants at 48 and 72 h post-transfection using the SIV core antigen kit (Coulter Corp., Hialeah, FL). Construction of pSIVIκB-αS32/36A—The sequence of SIVmac239 from 8997 to 9499 nucleotides was amplified by PCR from p239SpE3′ (NIH AIDS Research & Reference Reagent Program) with the primers SIV11, 5′-CCCAAGCTTGCTAGCTAAGTTAAGGCAGG-3′ and SIV12, 5′-TTCCGCGGCCGCTATGGCCGACGTCGACTACTCACAAGAGAGTGAGCTC-3′. The PCR product was ligated to pSP73 (Promega) after digestion with Hind III and SalI to generate pSP73SIV11/12. Then, the sequence of SIVmac239 from nucleotides 9682 to 10535 was amplified from p239SpE3′ with the primers SIV13, 5′-ACGCGTCGACGCGGCCGCTCTAGACATGTCTCATTTTATAAAAGAA AAG-3′ and SIV14, 5′-GGAATTCTAATGTTGGTGGAAACTG-3′ and ligated to pSP73SIV11/12 after digestion with SalI and EcoRI to generate the shuttle SIVΔnef. The resulting nef sequence was deleted from nucleotides 9501 to 9681 and replaced with a sequence containing a stop codon after the 56th amino acid of Nef followed by the unique cloning sites SalI and XbaI. The IκB-αS32/36A cDNA fused to the FLAG epitope was cloned in sense or antisense orientation in the shuttle SIVΔnef digested with SalI and XbaI to generate the shuttles SIVIκB-αS32/36A and SIVIκB-antisense, respectively. For cloning in sense orientation, IκB-αS32/36A was amplified from pCMV-HA-IκB-αS32/36A with the primers 5′IκB-α, 5′-ACGCGTCGACATGTTCCAGGCGGCCGAGCG-3′ and 3′IκB-α, 5′-GCTCTAGATCACTTGTCGTCATCGTCTTTGTAGTCTAACGTCAGACGCTGG-3′. For cloning in antisense orientation, IκB-αS32/36A was amplified with the primers 5′IκB-AS, 5′-GCTCTAGAATGTTCCAGGCGGCCGAGCGC-3′ and 3′IκB-AS, 5′-ACGCGTCGACTAGTAACGTCAGACGCTGGCCTCCAAA-3′. Following NheI and EcoRI digestion, the 1.3 kb of the shuttle SIVΔnef or the 2.3-kb fragments of the shuttles SIVIκB-αS32/36A and SIVIκB-antisense were ligated to the 14-kb NheI/EcoR I fragment of pMA239 to generate pSIVΔnef, pSIVIκB-αS32/36A, and pSIVIκB-antisense, respectively. The correct coding frame of the insert was verified by DNA sequencing. The expression of viral proteins was analyzed by transfection of 293 T cells with the viral plasmids (5 μg) and 48 h later by Western blotting of cell extracts (10 μg) with anti-SIVmac251 serum (NIH AIDS Research & Reference Reagent Program) (26.Quinto I. Mallardo M. Baldassarre F. Scala G. Englund G. Jeang K.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17567-17572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The IκB-αS32/36A-FLAG protein was immunoprecipitated from cell extracts (500 μg) using anti-FLAG M2 mAb (Sigma) and detected by Western blotting with IκB-α (C-15)-G goat polyclonal IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). Viral Stocks and Cell Culture Infections—Viral stocks were produced by transfecting 293 T cells with viral plasmids and evaluated by RT assay and p27gag antigen using the SIV core antigen kit (Coulter Corp., Hialeah, FL) as previously reported (26.Quinto I. Mallardo M. Baldassarre F. Scala G. Englund G. Jeang K.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17567-17572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). For cell culture infections, CEMx174 (105 cells) and rhesus macaque PBMC (2 × 105 cells) stimulated with concanavalin A were infected with 105 and 2 × 105 cpm RT activity of viral stocks, respectively. Viral growth was monitored by RT activity, as previously described (26.Quinto I. Mallardo M. Baldassarre F. Scala G. Englund G. Jeang K.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17567-17572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). For in vitro passages, CEMx174 (105 cells) were infected with 105 cpm RT activity. At the RT peak of each infection, virus was collected and used for infections in the next passage. For analysis of nef region, viruses were collected at the RT peak of each passage and the viral RNA was analyzed by RT-PCR using the primers SIV15, 5′-TCTGCGACAGAGACT-3′ (9377–9391 nucleotides of SIVmac239) and SIV16, 5′-TCCTGCCAATCTGGT-3′ (9791–9805 nucleotides of SIVmac239). Titers of viral stocks for monkey infection were measured as TCID50 by using CEMx174 cells. Animal Infection Studies—Mamu-A*01-positive juvenile rhesus macaques were maintained in accordance with the American Association for Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care Standards and housed in a biosafety level 2 facility. Viral infection was performed by intravenous inoculation of 100 TCID50 of viral stocks. The infected monkeys were monitored for plasma viral load by detecting SIV RNA using a real-time reverse transcription-PCR with a threshold sensitivity of 200 viral RNA copies Eq/ml (31.Chen X. Scala G. Quinto I. Liu W. Chun T.W. Shawn Justement J. Cohen O.J. van Cott T.C. Iwanicki M. Lewis M.G. Greenhouse J. Barry T. Venzon D. Fauci A.S. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 1225-1231Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The gag region was amplified by using the following primers and probe: SIV-F, 5′-AGTATGGGCAGCAAATGAAT-3′; SIV-R, 5′-TTCTCTTCTGCGTGAATGC-3′; SIV-P, 6FAM-AGATTTGGATTAGCAGAAAGCCTGTTGGA-TAMRA. For cocultures, PBMC and lymph node cells (106 up to 107) from infected animals were stimulated with 10 μg/ml PHA (Sigma-Aldrich) for 2 days and cultured with PHA-activated PBMC from uninfected monkeys or with CEMx174 cells. Cultures were monitored by RT activity and p27 production over 5 weeks of coculture. To analyze the nef region, viral RNA was reverse-transcribed and amplified using Superscript one-step RT-PCR for long template (Invitrogen Life Technologies) with the primers SIV15 and SIV16 above described. The PCR product (1 μl) was re-amplified with the primers SIV 17, 5′-GCGTGGGGAGACTTAT-3′ (9401–9416 nucleotides of SIV-mac239) and SIV 18,5′-CTTGCACTGTAATAAATCCC-3′ (9723–9742 nucleotides of SIVmac239). The PCR product was analyzed by liquid hybridization with a γ-32P-labeled IκB-α probe followed by electrophoresis on 10% acrylamide gel and autoradiography. The IκB-α probe was: 5′-TCCTGACCTGGTGTCACTC-3′. For gag analysis, viral RNA was amplified by RT-PCR with primers SIV-F and SIV-R above described, and the PCR products were detected by liquid hybridization with γ-32P-labeled SIV-P probe. Genomic DNA was extracted from lymph node cells using the Wizard Genomic DNA purification kit (Promega). The nef region was amplified by PCR of genomic DNA (100 ng) using the primers SIV25, 5′-TCCTCAGGACTGAACTGACC-3′ (9303–9322 nucleotides of SIVmac239) and SIV22, 5′-TACATCAAGAAAGTGGGCGTTC-3′ (10185–10206 nucleotides of SIVmac239) followed by nested PCR with the primers SIV17 and SIV18. The PCR products were analyzed by liquid hybridization with γ-32P-labeled IκB-α probe. Rhesus macaques were screened for the presence of the MAMU-A*01 allele by PCR of genomic DNA using the primers MAMU-A*01F, 5′-GACAGCGACGCCGCGAGCCAA-3′ and MAMU-A*01R, 5′-GCTGCAGCGTCTCCTTCCCC-3′ as described (32.Evans D.T. Piekarczyk M.S. Allen T.M. Boyson J.E. Yeager M. Hughes A.L. Gotch F.M. Hinshaw V.S. Watkins D.I. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 1374-1382PubMed Google Scholar). Immune Response—Antibody immune response was analyzed by ELISA using HIV-2 microplate EIA (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA). Plasma samples were tested at serial dilutions. The identification of SIV Gag p11C-specific T cells was performed by tetramer staining of freshly isolated PBMC (33.Kuroda M.J. Schmitz J.E. Barouch D.H. Craiu A. Allen T.M. Sette A. Watkins D.I. Forman M.A. Letvin N.L. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 1373-1381Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Briefly, PBMC (106 cells) were stained with phycoerythrin-labeled tetrameric Mamu-A*01/SIV Gag p11C epitope (CTPYDINQM) (NIH, MHC Tetramer Core Facility) for 15 min at room temperature followed by staining with anti-human CD8 monoclonal antibody conjugated with peridinin chlorophyl protein (BD Biosciences, San Diego, CA) for further 15 min. Tetramer+-CD8+ T cells were measured by using a FACScalibur flow cytometer and CellQuest software (BD Biosciences). To detect IFN-γ+ CTL, PBMC were stimulated for 2 h with a 20-mer SIVmac239 Gag peptide (2.5 μg/ml) spanning the amino acids 181–200 of SIVmac239 Gag (CTPYDINQMLNCVGDHQAAM) (NIH AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program) in 5% fetal bovine serum RPMI 1640. As controls, PBMC were stimulated with staphylococcus-enterotoxin B or left unstimulated. After overnight incubation with (1 μg/ml) of Brefeldin A (BD PharMingen, San Diego, CA), PBMC were stained with peridinin chlorophyl protein-labeled anti-human CD8 monoclonal antibody (BD Biosciences). Then, cells were fixed and permeabilized using Cytofix/Perm kit (BD PharMingen) followed by staining with phycoerythrin-labeled anti-human IFN-γ (BD PharMingen). IFN-γ+-CD8+ T cells were measured by flow cytometry. Levels of peripheral CD4- and CD8-positive T cells were determined by flow cytometry by using the following antibodies: CD3-FITC (BD Pharmingen), CD4-PE and CD8-PE (BD Biosciences). Inhibition of SIVmac239 Expression by IκB-αS32/36A—We first analyzed the LTR-driven transcription of SIVmac239 in response to IκB-αS32/36A. COS-1 cells were transfected with pSIVLTRluc and a Tat-expressing plasmid in the presence or absence of pCMV-HA-IκB-αS32/36A (Fig. 1a). As measured by luciferase activity, IκB-αS32/36A strongly inhibited the Tat-mediated transactivation of SIV-LTR. The inhibition by IκB-α S32/36A was likely exerted by squelching NF-κB proteins required for full activation of SIV-LTR. In fact, co-transfection of p50 and p65 subunits of NF-κB enhanced the Tat-mediated transactivation of SIV-LTR (Fig. 1b). We also tested the effect of IκB-αS32/36A on SIV production by co-transfecting the SIV-mac239 genome alone or together with HIV-1 plasmids expressing IκB-αS32/36A in sense (pNLIκB-αS32/36A) or antisense (pNLIκB-antisense) orientation (26.Quinto I. Mallardo M. Baldassarre F. Scala G. Englund G. Jeang K.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17567-17572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1c). IκB-αS32/36A exerted a strong inhibition of SIV production as measured by p27 Gag detection in culture supernatants. These results indicate that the Tat-mediated expression of SIV is enhanced by NF-κB and is inhibited by IκB-αS32/36A. Attenuation of SIVIκB-α S32/36A in Cell Cultures—Next, we generated a SIVmac239 expressing IκB-αS32/36A, SIVIκB-αS32/36A, by inserting the IκB-αS32/36A cDNA fused to the FLAG epitope into the nef region of SIVmac239 (Fig. 2a). As a control, we generated a SIVmac239 carrying the IκB-αS32/36A insert in antisense orientation (Fig. 2a). In both recombinant viruses, we deleted the nef coding region from nucleotides 9501 to 9681 of SIVmac239 leaving in place the sequence that overlaps with the env gene and codes for the first 56 amino acids of Nef (Fig. 2a). We detected the expression of viral proteins and IκB-αS32/36A by Western blotting of cell extracts upon transfection of 293 T cells with the viral plasmids (Fig. 2, b and c). As expected, IκB-αS32/36A was produced exclusively by SIVIκB-αS32/36A (Fig. 2c). Next, we analyzed the viral growth in CEMx174 cells and in rhesus macaque PBMC (Fig. 3a). SIVIκB-αS32/36A was highly attenuated as compared with the wild-type SIVmac239, the nef-deleted virus (SIVΔnef), and the SIVIκB-antisense (Fig. 3a, left panel). An even stronger attenuation was observed in PBMC where SIVIκB-αS32/36A was unable to grow (Fig. 3a, right panel). SIVIκB-αS32/36A maintained the attenuated phenotype (Fig. 3b) as well as the IκB-αS32/36A insert (Fig. 3c) in eight serial passages in CEMx174 cultures. In contrast, the insert was rapidly rearranged and lost in SIVIκB-antisense (Fig. 3c). In Vivo Attenuation of SIVIκB-αS32/36A—To analyze the in vivo infectivity of SIVIκB-αS32/36A, we intravenously injected rhesus macaques with 100 TCID50 of SIVIκB-αS32/36A (529, 904, 540, and 893) or SIVIκB-antisense (WBA, 374, 825, and 599). In the period of acute infection extending from week 0 through week 8, the group of animals infected with SIVIκB-αS32/36A had peaks of viremia lower than animals infected with control antisense virus (p = 0.029 by the Wilcoxon ranksum test, Fig. 4). From week 8 to 16, the group infected with SIVIκB-αS32/36A all had undetectable virus showing an overall significant difference with the control group infected with antisense virus (p = 0.028 by the Wei-Johnson method). After that time, the animals infected with the sense virus were aviremic for up to 2 years post-infection with a transient viremia in monkey 529 observed at weeks 17 and 18, while animals infected with control antisense virus were persistently viremic with the exception of monkey WBA (Fig. 4). Accordingly, no virus production was detected in cocultures of PBMC from SIVIκB-αS32/36A-infected animals (529, 904, 540, 893) at months 3, 6, 12, and 24 post-infection (Table I). In parallel, cocultures of PBMC from the control SIVIκB-antisense-infected monkeys produced virus at months 3, 6, 12, and 24 in animals 374, 825, and 599, and at month 3 in animal WBA (Table I). Moreover, cells obtained from two inguinal lymph nodes at 1 year post-infection produced virus only in the case of animals infected with the control antisense construct (WBA, 374, 825, 599; Table I). At 2 years post-infection, CD4+ T cells counts were stably maintained in the animals infected with SIVIκB-αS32/36A while they were substantially reduced in two animals of the control group (WBA, 374; Fig. 4). Altogether, these data indicate that the expression of IκB-αS32/36A coupled with nef deletion conferred a stronger attenuation of SIV in vivo as compared with an SIV nef-deleted control (SIVIκB-antisense).Table IVirus production in PBMC and lymph nodes of infected monkeysMonkeyPBMCLymph nodes, Month 24Month 3Month 6Month 12Month 24S1VIκB-antisenseWBA+---+374+++++825+++++599+++++S1VIκB-αS32/36A529-----904-----540-----893----- Open table in a new tab Next, we analyzed the stability of the IκB-α insert in plasma virions and lymph node cells. At week 3 of primary infection, the IκB-αS32/36A insert was completely (WBA, 374) or partially (825, 599) lost when placed in antisense orientation (Fig. 5, lanes 1–4), while it was maintained in the viral genome when placed in sense orientation (529, 904, 540, 893) (Fig. 5, lanes 12–15). At week 18 post-infection, virions produced in the antisense-infected animals had completely lost the IκB-αS32/36A antisense insert with the exception of 599 (Fig. 5, lanes 6–9). At the same time, animals 904, 540, and 893 infected with the sense construct tested negative in this assay (Fig. 5, lanes 18–20) consistently with the lack of detectable plasma viremia shown in Fig. 4; virions produced in 529 were depleted of the IκB-α insert (Fig. 5, lane 17). These findings indicate that viral attenuation correlated with the maintenance of IκB-αS32/36A expressed in sense orientation; in fact, the lack of the sense IκB-αS32/36A insert was associated with viremia in 529, while the maintenance of the antisense IκB-αS32/36A insert did not provide attenuation in 599. At 1 year post-infection, the genomic DNA from two inguinal lymph nodes of each monkey was analyzed for virus integration. In the animals infected with SIVIκB-antisense, the nef region was largely deleted (Fig. 6, upper panel, lanes 1–4). In animals infected with SIVIκB-αS32/36A, the nef region was amplified as a band of the expected size; smaller bands were also detected in 529, 904, and 540 (Fig. 6, upper panel, lanes 5–8). By liquid hybridization, the IκB-αS32/36A insert was present in the nef-amplified region of animals infected with SIVIκB-αS32/36A (Fig. 6, lower panel, lanes 5–8), while it was absent in animals infected with the control antisense virus with the exception of 599 (Fig. 6, lower panel, lanes 1–4). These findings are consistent with the higher genomic stability of SIVIκB-αS32/36A as compared with the SIVIκB-antisense control virus.Fig. 6Analysis of virus integration in lymph node cells. The nef region was amplified from genomic DNA of lymph node cells with the primers SIV22 and SIV25 followed by nested PCR with primers SIV17 and SIV18. The viral plasmids pSIVIκB-αS32/36A and pSIVIκB-antisense were amplified as controls. The nef PCR product is 1147 bp in SIVIκB-αS32/36A and SIVIκB-antisense (upper panel). The nef product was analyzed by liquid hybridization with the IκB-α probe (lower panel).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Analysis of Immune Response—Next, we analyzed the immune response elicited in infected monkeys. SIV-specific antibodies were detected at week 2 post-infection in all the animals and increased to higher levels throughout 2 years of post-infection observation (Fig. 7a). Antibody production did not correlate with the ability to control the viremia since the group of animals infected with antisense construct showed similar or even higher titers of SIV-specific antibodies as compared with the group of animals infected with SIVIκB-αS32/36A (Fig. 7a). In further studies, we measured the number of p11C Gag-specific CD8+ T lymphocytes. Over 2 years of observation, the percentages of p11C Gag-specific CD8+ T lymphocytes ranged between 0.1 and 2.15 in the group of animals infected with SIV-IκBαS32/36A, and between 0.1 and 0.6 in the group of animals infected with antisense construct (Fig. 7b) with no significant dif"

https://openalex.org/W1536588805,"Gravity is by far the weakest of the four known forces. The gravitational attraction between two protons is 35 orders of magnitude weaker than their electromagnetic repulsion. The weakness of gravity may not be an intrinsic property, however, but may result from the propagation of gravity in extra spatial dimensions. In his Perspective, [Feng][1] describes the search for strong gravity and extra dimensions that is now being pursued on many fronts--from tabletop probes of Newtonian gravity to searches for microscopic black holes in kilometer-scale cosmic ray detectors. Upcoming experiments will either exclude this explanation of the weakness of gravity or find evidence for a radically new view of spacetime.
