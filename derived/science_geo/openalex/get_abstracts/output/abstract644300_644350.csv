https://openalex.org/W2994689007,"Amaranth has two morphological types (morphs), one is red and another is green morph. Red morph amaranth is a marvelous source of nutrients, antioxidant pigments, minerals, and phytochemicals compared to green morph amaranth. For this purpose, we selected 25 red morph genotypes to evaluate in terms of proximate, minerals, antioxidant pigments and phytochemicals and antioxidant activity in RCBD design in three replicates. The leaves of red morph amaranth are an excellent source of dietary fiber, carbohydrates, moisture, and protein. We found remarkable potassium, calcium, magnesium (24.96, 10.13, 30.01 mg g-1), iron, manganese, copper, zinc (1089.19, 243.59, 25.77, 986.61 μg g-1), chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b (31.79, 16.05 mg 100 g-1), β-cyanins, total flavonoids (102.10 RE μg g-1 DW), β-xanthins, betalains (33.30, 33.09, 66.40 μg 100 g-1), carotenoids, total phenolics (172.23 GAE μg g-1 DW), β-carotene (1225.94, 1043.18 μg g-1), vitamin C (955.19 μg g-1), and antioxidant activity (DPPH and ABTS+) (19.97 and 39.09 TEAC μg g-1 DW) in the red morph amaranth leaves. We can select the genotype RA5, RA8, RA18, RA22, and RA25 as antioxidant-enriched red morph amaranth. It revealed that amaranth β-cyanins, phenolics, betalains, flavonoids, β-xanthins, carotenoids, vitamin C, and β-carotene had strong antioxidant activity. These phytochemicals contributed significantly in the antioxidant potentials of red morphs amaranth. Red morph amaranth could be a potential source of nutrients, antioxidant pigments, minerals, and phytochemicals as these compounds scavenged ROS and served as potential antioxidants in our daily diet to attaining nutritional and antioxidant sufficiency."
https://openalex.org/W2994860081,"Peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.) is an important nutrient-rich food legume and valued for its good quality cooking oil. The fatty acid content is the major determinant of the quality of the edible oil. The oils containing higher monounsaturated fatty acid are preferred for improved shelf life and potential health benefits. Therefore, a high oleic/linoleic fatty acid ratio is the target trait in an advanced breeding program. The two mutant alleles, ahFAD2A (on linkage group a09) and ahFAD2B (on linkage group b09) control fatty acid composition for higher oleic/linoleic ratio in peanut. In the present study, marker-assisted backcrossing was employed for the introgression of two FAD2 mutant alleles from SunOleic95R into the chromosome of ICGV06100, a high oil content peanut breeding line. In the marker-assisted backcrossing-introgression lines, a 97% increase in oleic acid, and a 92% reduction in linoleic acid content was observed in comparison to the recurrent parent. Besides, the oleic/linoleic ratio was increased to 25 with respect to the recurrent parent, which was only 1.2. The most significant outcome was the stable expression of oil-content, oleic acid, linoleic acid, and palmitic acid in the marker-assisted backcrossing-introgression lines over the locations. No significant difference was observed between high oleic and normal oleic in peanuts for seedling traits except germination percentage. In addition, marker-assisted backcrossing-introgression lines exhibited higher yield and resistance to foliar fungal diseases, i.e., late leaf spot and rust."
https://openalex.org/W2996366493,"Early life stress is associated with long-term and pervasive adverse effects on neuroendocrine development, affecting normal cognitive and emotional development. Experimental manipulations like environmental enrichment (EE) may potentially reverse the effects of early life stress induced by maternal separation (MS) paradigm in rodents. However, the functional brain networks involved in the effects of EE after prolonged exposure to MS have not yet been investigated. In order to evaluate possible changes in brain functional connectivity induced by EE after MS, quantitative cytochrome c oxidase (CCO) histochemistry was applied to determine regional brain oxidative metabolism in adult male rats. Unexpectedly, results show that prolonged MS during the entire weaning period did not cause any detrimental effects on spatial learning and memory, including depressive-like behavior evaluated in the forced-swim test, and decreased anxiety-like behavior. However, EE seemed to alter anxiety- and depression-like behaviors in both control and MS groups, but improved spatial memory in the latter groups. Analysis of brain CCO activity showed significantly lower metabolic capacity in most brain regions selected in EE groups probably associated with chronic stress, but no effects of MS on brain metabolic capacity. In addition, principal component analysis of CCO activity revealed increased large-scale functional brain connectivity comprising at least three main networks affected by EE in both MS and control groups. Moreover, EE induced a pattern of functional brain connectivity associated with stress and anxiety-like behavior as compared with non-enriched groups. In conclusion, EE had differential effects on cognition and emotional behavior irrespective of exposure to MS. In view of the remarkable effects of EE on brain function and behavior, implementation of rodent housing conditions should be optimized by evaluating the balance between scientific validity and animal welfare."
https://openalex.org/W2995051023,"Endolithic microbial communities survive nutrient and energy deficient conditions while contributing to the weathering of their mineral substrate. This study examined the mineral composition and microbial communities of fully serpentinized weathered rock from 0.1 to 6.5 m depth at a site within the Khalilovsky massif, Orenburg Region, Southern Ural Mountains, Russia. The mineral composition includes a major content of serpentinite family (mostly consisting of lizardite and chrysotile), magnesium hydrocarbonates (hydromagnesite with lesser amounts of hydrotalcite and pyroaurite) concentrated in the upper layers, and clay minerals. We found that the deep-seated weathered serpentinites are chrysotile-type minerals, while the middle and surface serpentinites mostly consist of lizardite and chrysotile types. Microbial community analysis, based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing, showed a similar diversity of phyla throughout the depth profile. The dominant bacterial phyla were the Actinobacteria (of which unclassified genera in the orders Acidimicrobiales and Actinomycetales were most numerous), Chloroflexi (dominated by an uncultured P2-11E order) and the Proteobacteria (predominantly class Betaproteobacteria). Densities of several groups of bacteria were negatively correlated with depth. Occurrence of the orders Actinomycetales, Gaiellales, Solirubrobacterales, Rhizobiales and Burkholderiales were positively correlated with depth. Our findings show that endolithic microbial communities of the Khalilovsky massif have similar diversity to those of serpentine soils and rocks, but are substantially different from those of the aqueous environments of actively serpentinizing systems."
https://openalex.org/W2996305198,"Existing research indicates that learning about the Pavlovian ‘signal value’ of stimuli can induce attentional biases: findings suggest that our attentional system prioritises detection of stimuli that have previously signalled availability of high reward. These findings potentially provide a human analogue of sign-tracking behaviour previously reported in studies of non-human animals. Here we examine a visual search task that has been developed to demonstrate the Pavlovian influence of reward on attention, in which the critical reward-signalling stimuli are never explicit targets of search. This procedure has previously yielded robust effects of reward on attention; however it remains unclear whether this pattern reflects a persistent and automatic bias in attentional capture based on prior experience of stimulus–reward pairings, or whether it results from participants strategically attending to reward-signalling distractors because they provide useful information about reward magnitude. To investigate this issue, in the current study participants initially completed a rewarded visual search task, in which colours of distractor stimuli signalled availability of high or low reward. Participants then completed a test phase in which rewards were no longer available, such that distractor colours no longer provided useful information on reward availability. Performance during the initial rewarded phase was impaired by the presence of a distractor signalling availability of high relative to low reward. Crucially, the magnitude of this reward-related distraction effect did not reduce in the subsequent unrewarded test phase. This suggests that participants’ experience of differences in reward value signalled by distractor stimuli in this task can induce persistent biases in the extent to which these stimuli involuntarily capture attention, even when they are entirely task-irrelevant."
https://openalex.org/W2995156878,"Nectar-inhabiting microbes are increasingly appreciated as important components of plant-pollinator interactions. We quantified the incidence, abundance, diversity, and composition of bacterial and fungal communities in floral nectar of two night-blooming plants of the Sonoran Desert over the course of a flowering season: Datura wrightii (Solanaceae), which is pollinated by hawkmoths, and Agave palmeri (Agavaceae), which is pollinated by bats but visited by hawkmoths that forage for nectar. We examined the relevance of growing environment (greenhouse vs. field), time (before and after anthesis), season (from early to late in the flowering season), and flower visitors (excluded via mesh sleeves or allowed to visit flowers naturally) in shaping microbial assemblages in nectar. We isolated and identified bacteria and fungi from >300 nectar samples to estimate richness and taxonomic composition. Our results show that microbes were common in D. wrightii and A. palmeri nectar in the greenhouse but more so in field environments, both before and especially after anthesis. Bacteria were isolated more frequently than fungi. The abundance of microbes in nectar of D. wrightii peaked near the middle of the flowering season. Microbes generally were more abundant as time for floral visitation increased. The composition of bacterial and especially fungal communities differed significantly between nectars of D. wrightii and A. palmeri, opening the door to future studies examining their functional roles in shaping nectar chemistry, attractiveness, and pollinator specialization."
https://openalex.org/W2996186483,"People with depression, anxiety, or psychosis often complain of confusion, problems concentrating or difficulties cognitively appraising contextual cues. The same applies to people with neurodegenerative diseases or brain damage such as dementia or stroke. Assessments of those cognitive difficulties often occurs in cross-sectional and controlled clinical settings. Information on daily moment-to-moment cognitive fluctuations and its relation to affect and context is lacking. The development and evaluation of a digital cognition task is presented. It enables the fine-grained mapping of cognition and its relation to mood, intrapersonal factors and context.The momentary Digit Symbol Substitution Task is a modified digital version of the original paper-and-pencil task, with a duration of 30 seconds and implemented in an experience sampling protocol (8 semi-random assessments a day on 6 consecutive days). It was tested in the healthy population (N = 40). Descriptive statistics and multilevel regression analyses were used to determine initial feasibility and assess cognitive patterns in everyday life. Cognition outcome measures were the number of trials within the 30-second sessions and the percentage of correct trials.Subjects reported the task to be easy, pleasant and do-able. On average, participants completed 11 trials with 97% accuracy per 30-second session. Cognitive variation was related to mood, with an interaction between positive and negative affect for accuracy (% correct) (p = .001) and an association between positive affect and speed (number of trials) (p = .01). Specifically, cheerful, irritated and anxious seem to covary with cognition. Distraction and location are relevant contextual factors. The number of trials showed a learning effect (p < .001) and was sensitive to age (p < .001).Implementing a digital cognition task within an experience-sampling paradigm shows promise. Fine-tuning in further research and in clinical samples is needed. Gaining insight into cognitive functioning could help patients navigate and adjust the demands of daily life."
https://openalex.org/W3013259817,"Understanding how ecological networks are assembled is important because network structure reflects ecosystem functioning and stability. Quantitative network analysis incorporates measures of interaction strength as an estimate of the magnitude of the effect of interaction partners on one another. Most plant-pollinator network studies use frequency of interaction between individual pollinators and individual plants (encounter) as a surrogate of interaction strength. However, the number of flowers visited per encounter may strongly vary among pollinator and plant species, and therefore not all encounters are quantitatively equivalent. We sampled plant-pollinator interactions in a Mediterranean scrubland and tested whether using a measure of interaction strength based on the number of flowers visited resulted in changes in species (species strength, interaction species asymmetry, specialization) and network descriptors (nestedness, H2', interaction evenness, plant generality, pollinator generality) compared to the encounter-based measure. Several species (including some of the most abundant ones) showed important changes in species descriptors, notably in specialization. These changes were especially important in plant species with large floral displays, which became less specialized with the visit-based measure of interaction strength. At the network level we found significant changes in all properties analysed. With the encounter-based approach plant generality was much higher than pollinator generality (high specialization asymmetry between trophic levels). However, with the visit-based approach plant generality was greatly reduced so that plants and pollinators had similar levels of generalization. Interaction evenness also decreased strongly with the visit-based approach. We conclude that accounting for the number of flowers visited per encounter provides a more ecologically relevant measure of interaction strength. Our results have important implications for the stability of pollination networks and the evolution of plant-pollinator interactions. The use of a visit-based approach is especially important in studies relating interaction network structure and ecosystem function (pollination and/or exploitation of floral resources)."
https://openalex.org/W2995981022,"Controversy persists regarding many aspects of traumatic diaphragmatic hernia (TDH). We aimed to understand why some traumatic diaphragmatic injuries present with chronic hernia and to evaluate diagnosis and treatment options. Fifty acute and 19 chronic TDH patients were diagnosed and treated at our institution over a 10-year period. Clinical data from these two groups were analyzed statistically and compared. Chronic TDH patients had a significantly lower Injury Severity Score than acute TDH patients (10.26 ± 2.68 vs. 26.92 ± 4.79, P < 0.001). The most common surgical approach for acute and chronic TDH was thoracotomy and laparotomy, respectively. The length of the diaphragmatic rupture was significantly shorter in chronic TDH patients than acute TDH patients (6.00 ± 1.94 cm vs. 10.71 ± 3.30 cm, P < 0.001). The mean length of hospital stay was significantly longer for acute TDH patients than chronic TDH patients (41.18 ± 31.02 days vs. 16.65 ± 9.61 days, P = 0.002). In conclusion, milder trauma and a smaller diaphragmatic rupture were associated with delayed diagnosis. A thoraco-abdominal computed tomography scan is needed for patients with periphrenic injuries to avoid delayed diagnosis of TDH. Improved awareness and understanding of diaphragmatic injuries will increase the rate of early diagnosis and improve prognosis."
https://openalex.org/W2995045034,"The Eurasian otter (Lutra lutra) is an endangered species for which diet analyses are needed as part of its conservation efforts. Eurasian otters feed on vertebrates, such as fishes, and invertebrates, such as crustaceans, but their detailed taxonomies are not fully understood in part due to limited resolving power of traditional morphological identification methods. Here, we used high-throughput sequencing (HTS)-based DNA metabarcoding approaches to analyze diet profiles of Eurasian otters inhabiting a marshy estuary area in Korea. We investigated their diet profiles based on spraint sampling followed by DNA metabarcoding analyses targeting 12S rRNA gene region for vertebrates, 16S rRNA gene region for invertebrates, and cytochrome c oxidase 1 (COI) gene region for fishes. For the vertebrate analysis, a blocking oligonucleotide (OBS1) was designed to suppress amplification of DNA fragments derived from the otters. The 12S rRNA gene sequencing assay detected species belonging to fishes (95%) and amphibians (3.3%). Fishes detected by 12S rRNA gene sequencing included crucian carp (Carassius auratus), mullets (Mugil spp.), bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus), and northern snakehead (Channa argus), which were also detected by COI gene sequencing. Among invertebrates, mud flat crabs (Helicana spp.) and shrimps (Palaemon spp.) were abundant. The designed blocking oligonucleotide OBS1 effectively inhibited amplification of the otter’s DNA, with only up to 0.21% of vertebrate sequence reads assigned to the otter. This study demonstrated that HTS-based DNA metabarcoding methods were useful to provide in-depth information regarding diet profiles of the otters at our sampling site. By using HTS-based DNA metabarcoding approaches, future research will explore detailed taxonomies of their diets across locations and seasons."
https://openalex.org/W2996968344,"Objective Interstitial cystitis (IC) is a chronic intractable disease. Recently, the potential application of stem cell (SC) therapy was suggested for IC management. This study aimed to establish an optimal SC source and verify the efficacy and safety of SC injection therapy in an IC rat model. Design After IC animal model induction, urine-derived stem cells (USCs), adipose tissue-derived stem cells (ADSCs), bone marrow-derived stem cells (BMSCs) and amniotic fluid-derived stem cells (AFSCs) were injected into the bladder submucosa. The following parameters were analysed: 1) functional improvement of bladder via cystometry, 2) histological changes and 3) inflammatory gene expression and regenerative potential of damaged bladder tissues. Additionally, an optimal method for SC introduction in terms of effective bladder regeneration was analysed. Results Intercontraction interval was significantly increased and inflammatory reactions and fibrotic changes were decreased in all of the SC-injected groups than in the control group. PCR analysis revealed that inflammatory gene expression significantly decreased in the USC-treated group than in the other groups. To confirm the optimal SC injection route in the IC rat model, group was divided according to the following criteria: 1) direction of SC injection into the bladder submucosa, 2) injection via tail vein, 3) transurethral instillation. In each analysis, the groups in which SCs were injected into the bladder submucosa showed significantly longer intercontraction interval, better morphologic regeneration and inhibition of bladder inflammatory reaction compared with the other groups. Conclusion Regardless of the cell source, human tissue-derived mesenchymal SCs regenerated damaged bladder tissue, promoted functional recovery and inhibited inflammatory cell accumulation in an IC rat model; particularly, USC had the highest inhibitory effect on inflammation. Additionally, direct USC injection into the bladder submucosa was expected to have the best therapeutic effect, which will be an important factor for clinical applications in the future."
https://openalex.org/W3013508968,"Background Abortion draws varied emotions based on individual and societal beliefs. Often, women known to have sought or those seeking abortion services experience stigma and social exclusion within their communities. Understanding community perception of abortion is critical in informing the design and delivery of interventions that reduce the gaps in access to safe abortion for women. Objective We explored community perceptions and beliefs relating to abortion, clients of abortion services, and abortifacients in Kenya. Methods We conducted focus group discussions (FGDs) and in-depth interviews (IDIs) in Kisumu and Nairobi counties in Kenya among a mix of adult men and women, pharmacists, nurses, and community health volunteers. Results Community perspectives around abortion were heterogeneous, reflecting a myriad of opinions ranging from total anti-abortion to more pro-choice positions, and with rural-urban differences. Notably, negative views on abortion became more nuanced and tempered, especially among young women in urban areas, as details of factors that motivate women to seek abortion became apparent. Participants were mostly aware of the pathways through which women and girls access abortion services. Whereas abortion is commonplace, multiple structural and socioeconomic barriers, as well as stigma, are prevalent, thus impeding access to safe and quality services. Conclusion Community perceptions on abortion are heterogeneous, varying by gender, occupation, level of education, residence, and position in society. Stigma and the hostile abortion environment limit access to safe abortion services, with several negative consequences. There is urgent need to strengthen community-based approaches to mitigate predisposing and enabling factors for unsafe abortions."
https://openalex.org/W2994928278,"Background This study was aimed to assess immunological recovery, failure, and factors associated with CD-4 T-cells progression over time, among adolescents and adults living with HIV on Antiretroviral Therapy in Northern Ethiopia. Methods A retrospective cross sectional study was done on 19,525 HIV patients on ART. Data were collected using a data retrieval checklist from a database. All eligible data in the database were exported to Microsoft excel 2010 and then data verification and filtration were done before exporting to STATA 14.0 for analysis. Factors associated with recent CD-4 count were modeled by using Generalized Linear Model poison family. Results Among the patients with advanced HIV infection (< 200 CD-4 T-cell/ mm3) at baseline, only 28.35%, 95% CI (27.45–29.26) of them had immunological recovery (≥ 500 T-cells/mm3). Only 2.14%, 95%CI (1.94%- 2.35%) of the patients had immunological failure. Baseline CD-4 count (Incidence Rate Ratio (IRR) = 1.0007, 95%CI = 1.00069–1.00078), patients from military health care facility (IRR = 1.11, 95%CI = 1.06–1.16), good adherence (IRR = 1.12, 95%CI = 1.04–1.21) and viral load suppression (IRR = 1.31, 95%CI = 1.28–1.33) were positively associated with recent CD-4 count in the full model. Whereas, being male (IRR = 0.85, 95%CI = 0.83–0.86), patients with on Anti-Retroviral Therapy (ART) regimen of 1e (TDF-3TC-EFV), 2f (AZT-3TC-ATV/r), and 2h (TDF-3TC-ATV/r) (IRR = 0.92, 95%CI = 0.91–0.94), (IRR = 0.65, 95%CI = 0.55–0.76) and (IRR = 0.71, 95%CI = 0.63–0.81) respectively were negatively associated with the recent CD-4 count in the full model. Conclusions Immunological recovery was achieved by 1/3 of the patients despite being on highly active ART (HAART). Therefore, intensive adherence counseling, follow-up and support should be focused on patients with viral non suppression to enhance immunological recovery."
https://openalex.org/W2995197331,"The potential role of probiotic bacteria as adjuvants in vaccine trials led to their use as nonparenteral live mucosal vaccine vectors. Yet, interactions between these vectors, the host and the microbiome are poorly understood. This study evaluates impact of three probiotic, Lactobacillus acidophilus, vector strains, and their interactions with the host’s immune response, on the gut microbiome. One strain expressed the membrane proximal external region from HIV-1 (MPER). The other two expressed MPER and either secreted interleukin-1ß (IL-1ß) or expressed the surface flagellin subunit C (FliC) as adjuvants. We also used MPER with rice bran as prebiotic supplement. We observed a strain dependent, differential effect suggesting that MPER and IL-1β induced a shift of the microbiome while FliC had minimal impact. Joint probiotic and prebiotic use resulted in a compound effect, highlighting a potential synbiotic approach to impact efficacy of vaccination. Careful consideration of constitutive adjuvants and use of prebiotics is needed depending on whether or not to target microbiome modulation to improve vaccine efficacy. No clear associations were observed between total or MPER-specific IgA and the microbiome suggesting a role for other immune mechanisms or a need to focus on IgA-bound, resident microbiota, most affected by an immune response."
https://openalex.org/W2995444270,"Objective This study is aimed toward establishing a decision-making model with multiple criteria for appraisal and reimbursement to compare the attitudes of different stakeholders toward various dimensions and criteria and to evaluate the five targeted therapies (bevacizumab, cetuximab, panitumumab, aflibercept, and regorafenib) for metastatic colorectal cancer. Method This study is a multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) using a model that includes three dimensions and nine criteria. Both the overall and individual scores of the respective targeted therapies in different dimensions and criteria were calculated. A sensitivity analysis was carried out in order to evaluate the robustness of the research results. An interview-based questionnaire survey was applied to obtain the performance information for the targeted therapies and the weights of the dimensions and criteria. Results Overall, the clinical dimension had the highest weight, followed by the economic dimension, and finally, the social dimension. In the clinical dimension, the “comparative efficacy” criterion had the highest weight; in the economic dimension, the “cost-effectiveness” criterion” was given the greatest importance; in the social dimension, the “social concern and patient needs” criterion was given more emphasis. The overall values ranked from high to low as follows: cetuximab (overall score 3.3666), bevacizumab (3.3043), panitumumab (3.2030), aflibercept (2.8923) and regorafenib (2.8366). Conclusions A comprehensive value assessment system combining “multi-dimensional criteria,” “multi-perspectives,” and an “integrative assessment” is necessary to evaluate the value of medicines. The results showed not only the order of weights of different dimensions or criteria, but also the rankings of the value of the targeted therapies."
https://openalex.org/W2995543141,"Background Pulmonary Tuberculosis (PTB) is a major health problem in prisons. Multiple studies of TB in regional Ethiopian prisons have assessed prevalence and risk factors but have not examined recently implemented screening programs for TB in prisons. This study compares bacteriologically-confirmed PTB (BC-PTB) prevalence in prison entrants versus residents and identifies risk factors for PTB in Kality prison, a large federal Ethiopian prison located in Addis Ababa, through a study of an enhanced TB screening program. Methods Participating prisoners (n = 13,803) consisted of 8,228 entrants screened continuously and 5,575 residents screened in two cross-sectional waves for PTB symptoms, demographics, TB risk factors, and medical history. Participants reporting at least one symptom of PTB were asked to produce sputum which was examined by microscopy for acid-fast bacilli, Xpert MTB/RIF assay and MGIT liquid culture. Prevalence of BC-PTB, defined as evidence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) in sputum by the above methods, was compared in entrants and residents for the study. Descriptive analysis of prevalence was followed by bivariate and multivariate analyses of risk factors. Results Prisoners were mainly male (86%), young (median age 26 years) and literate (89%). Prevalence of TB symptoms by screening was 17% (2,334/13,803) with rates in residents >5-fold higher than entrants. Prevalence of BC-PTB detected by screening in participating prisoners was 0.16% (22/13,803). Prevalence in residents increased in the second resident screening compared to the first (R1 = 0.10% and R2 = 0.39%, p = 0.027), but remained higher than in entrants (4.3-fold higher during R1 and 3.1-fold higher during R2). Drug resistance (DR) was found in 38% (5/13) of culture-isolated MTB. Risk factors including being ever diagnosed with TB, history of TB contact and low Body Mass Index (BMI) (<18.5) were significantly associated with BC-PTB (p<0.05). Conclusions BC-PTB prevalence was strikingly lower than previously reported from other Ethiopian prisons. PTB appears to be transmitted within this prison based on its higher prevalence in residents than in entrants. Whether a sustained program of PTB screening of entrants and/or residents reduces prevalence of PTB in prisons is not clear from this study, but our findings suggest that resources should be prioritized to resident, rather than entrant, screening due to higher BC-PTB prevalence. Detection of multi- and mono-DR TB in both entrant and resident prisoners warrants regular screening for active TB and adoption of methods to detect drug resistance."
https://openalex.org/W2996338639,"Facial expressions are behavioural cues that represent an affective state. Because of this, they are an unobtrusive alternative to affective self-report. The perceptual identification of facial expressions can be performed automatically with technological assistance. Once the facial expressions have been identified, the interpretation is usually left to a field expert. However, facial expressions do not always represent the felt affect; they can also be a communication tool. Therefore, facial expression measurements are prone to the same biases as self-report. Hence, the automatic measurement of human affect should also make inferences on the nature of the facial expressions instead of describing facial movements only. We present two experiments designed to assess whether such automated inferential judgment could be advantageous. In particular, we investigated the differences between posed and spontaneous smiles. The aim of the first experiment was to elicit both types of expressions. In contrast to other studies, the temporal dynamics of the elicited posed expression were not constrained by the eliciting instruction. Electromyography (EMG) was used to automatically discriminate between them. Spontaneous smiles were found to differ from posed smiles in magnitude, onset time, and onset and offset speed independently of the producer’s ethnicity. Agreement between the expression type and EMG-based automatic detection reached 94% accuracy. Finally, measurements of the agreement between human video coders showed that although agreement on perceptual labels is fairly good, the agreement worsens with inferential labels. A second experiment confirmed that a layperson’s accuracy as regards distinguishing posed from spontaneous smiles is poor. Therefore, the automatic identification of inferential labels would be beneficial in terms of affective assessments and further research on this topic."
https://openalex.org/W2996084376,"Secreted effectors of fungal pathogens are essential elements for disease development. However, lack of sequence conservation among identified effectors has long been a problem for predicting effector complements in fungi. Here we have explored the expression characteristics of avirulence (Avr) genes and candidate effectors of the flax rust fungus, Melampsora lini. We performed transcriptome sequencing and real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) on RNA extracted from ungerminated spores, germinated spores, isolated haustoria and flax seedlings inoculated with M. lini isolate CH5 during plant infection. Genes encoding two categories of M. lini proteins, namely Avr proteins and plant cell wall degrading enzymes (CWDEs), were investigated in detail. Analysis of the expression profiles of 623 genes encoding predicted secreted proteins in the M. lini transcriptome shows that the six known Avr genes (i.e. AvrM (avrM), AvrM14, AvrL2, AvrL567, AvrP123 (AvrP) and AvrP4) fall within a group of 64 similarly expressed genes that are induced in planta and show a peak of expression early in infection with a subsequent decline towards sporulation. Other genes within this group include two paralogues of AvrL2, an AvrL567 virulence allele, and a number of genes encoding putative effector proteins. By contrast, M. lini genes encoding CWDEs fall into different expression clusters with their distribution often unrelated to their catalytic activity or substrate targets. These results suggest that synthesis of M. lini Avr proteins may be regulated in a coordinated fashion and that the expression profiling-based analysis has significant predictive power for the identification of candidate Avr genes."
https://openalex.org/W2996211298,"Goats play an important role in the livestock sector in Greece. The national herd consists mainly of two indigenous breeds, the Eghoria and Skopelos. Here, we report the population structure and genomic profiles of these two native goat breeds using Illumina’s Goat SNP50 BeadChip. Moreover, we present a panel of candidate markers acquired using different genetic models for breed discrimination. Quality control on the initial dataset resulted in 48,841 SNPs kept for downstream analysis. Principal component and admixture analyses were applied to assess population structure. The rate of inbreeding within breed was evaluated based on the distribution of runs of homozygosity in the genome and respective coefficients, the genomic relationship matrix, the patterns of linkage disequilibrium, and the historic effective population size. Results showed that both breeds exhibit high levels of genetic diversity. Level of inbreeding between the two breeds estimated by the Wright’s fixation index FST was low (Fst = 0.04362), indicating the existence of a weak genetic differentiation between them. In addition, grouping of farms according to their geographical locations was observed. This study presents for the first time a genome-based analysis on the genetic structure of the two indigenous Greek goat breeds and identifies markers that can be potentially exploited in future selective breeding programs for traceability purposes, targeted genetic improvement schemes and conservation strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2995301705,"Vitamin D deficiency is highly prevalent worldwide, and vitamin D-binding protein (DBP) a major regulator of serum vitamin D levels. The rs4588 and rs7041 polymorphisms of the GC gene constitute the genetic basis of the three major isoforms of circulating DBP (GC1s, GC1f, and GC2), while the rs2282679 variant is located in an important regulatory region of the GC gene. The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] deficiency and to ascertain whether it is associated with DBP levels and with GC gene variants. Biorepository samples of 443 women aged 20 to 72 years, with no evidence of clinical disease, were analyzed. Circulating levels of 25(OH)D were considered sufficient if ≥20 ng/mL and deficient if <20 ng/mL. Genotype analysis was performed by RT-PCR. Mean age was 53.4±9.4 years; mean BMI was 27.8±5.8 kg/m2. The overall sample had mean 25(OH)D levels of 22.8±8.3 ng/mL; 39.7% of participants had deficient circulating 25(OH)D levels. Higher prevalence ratios (PR) of 25(OH)D deficiency were found for the CC genotype of rs2282679 (PR 1.74; 95%CI 1.30 to 2.24; p<0.001), GC2 isoform (PR 1.66; 95%CI 1.17 to 2.38; p = 0.005), time since menopause (PR 1.02; 95%CI 1.003 to 1.03, p = 0.016), and HOMA-IR (PR 1.02; 95%CI 1.01 to 1.03, p = 0.004). DBP levels (per 30 μg/mL increase in DBP) were associated with lower PR for 25(OH)D deficiency (PR 0.89; 95%CI 0.80;0.99; p = 0.027). Except for HOMA-IR, these prevalence ratios remained significant after adjustment for age and BMI. In conclusion, the rs2282679 polymorphism and the GC2 isoform of DBP were associated with lower serum DBP levels and with susceptibility to 25(OH)D deficiency in Brazilian women with no evidence of clinical disease."
https://openalex.org/W3013298624,"Learning a powerful representation for a class with few labeled samples is a challenging problem. Although some state-of-the-art few-shot learning algorithms perform well based on meta-learning, they only focus on novel network architecture and fail to take advantage of the knowledge of every classification task. In this paper, to accomplish this goal, it proposes to combine the channel attention and spatial attention module (C-SAM), the C-SAM can mine deeply more effective information using samples of different classes that exist in different tasks. The residual network is used to alleviate the loss of the underlying semantic information when the network is deeper. Finally, a relation network including a C-SAM is applied to act as a classifier, which avoids learning more redundant information and compares the relation between difference samples. The experiment was carried out using the proposed method on six datasets, such as miniimagenet, Omniglot, Caltech-UCSD Birds, describable textures dataset, Stanford Dogs and Stanford Cars. The experimental results show that the C-SAM outperforms many state-of-the-art few-shot classification methods."
https://openalex.org/W2995082955,"To meet patients’ information and communication needs over time in order to improve their recovery is particularly challenging for patients undergoing cancer surgery. The aim of the study was to evaluate whether an intervention with a person-centred approach to information and communication for patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer undergoing surgery can improve the patients’ preparedness for surgery, discharge and recovery during six months following diagnosis and initial treatment. The intervention components involving a novel written interactive patient education material and person-centred communication was based on critical analysis of conventional information and communication for these patients. During 2014–2016, 488 consecutive patients undergoing elective surgery for colorectal cancer were enrolled in a quasi-experimental longitudinal study. In three hospitals, first a conventional care group (n = 250) was recruited, then the intervention was introduced, and finally the intervention group was recruited (n = 238). Patients’ trajectories of preparedness for surgery and recovery (Preparedness for Colorectal Cancer Surgery Questionnaire—PCSQ) health related quality of life (EORTC QLQ-C30) and distress (NCCS Distress Thermometer) were evaluated based on self-reported data at five time points, from pre-surgery to 6 months. Length of hospital stay and patients’ behavior in seeking health care pre- and post-surgery were extracted from patient records. Longitudinal structural equation models were used to test the hypothesized effects over time. Statistically significant positive effects were detected for two of the four PCSQ domains (patients searching for and making use of information, and making sense of the recovery) and for the role functioning domain of the EORTC QLQ-C30. Patients in the intervention group were also more likely to contact their assigned cancer “contact nurse” (a.k.a. nurse navigator) instead of contacting a nurse on duty at the ward or visiting the emergency department. In conclusion, the overall hypothesis was not confirmed. Further research is recommended on written and oral support tools to facilitate person-centred communication."
https://openalex.org/W2995850295,"Health effects of traffic-related air pollution (TRAP) concentrations in densely populated areas are previously described. However, there is still a lack of knowledge of the health effects of moderate TRAP levels. The aim of the current study, a population-based survey including 16 099 adults (response rate 33%), was to assess the relationship between TRAP estimates and respiratory symptoms in an area with modest levels of traffic; Telemark County, Norway. Respondents reported respiratory symptoms the past 12 months and two TRAP exposure estimates: amount of traffic outside their bedroom window and time spent by foot daily along a moderate to heavy traffic road. Females reported on average more symptoms than males. Significant relationships between traffic outside their bedroom window and number of symptoms were only found among females, with the strongest associations among female occasional smokers (incidence rate ratio [IRR], 1.75, 95% confidence interval (CI) [1.16–2.62] for moderate or heavy traffic compared to no traffic). Significant relationship between time spent daily by foot along a moderate to heavy traffic road and number of symptoms was found among male daily smokers (IRR 1.09, 95% CI [1.04–1.15] per hour increase). Associations between traffic outside bedroom window and each respiratory symptom were found. Significant associations were primarily detected among females, both among smokers and non-smokers. Significant associations between time spent by foot daily along a moderate to heavy traffic road (per hour) and nocturnal dyspnoea (odds ratio (OR) 1.20, 95% CI [1.05–1.38]), nocturnal chest tightness (OR 1.13 [1.00–1.28]) and wheezing (OR 1.14 [1.02–1.29]) were found among daily smokers, primarily men. Overall, we found significant associations between self-reported TRAP exposures and respiratory symptoms. Differences between genders and smoking status were identified. The findings indicate an association between TRAP and respiratory symptoms even in populations exposed to modest levels of TRAP."
https://openalex.org/W2995320095,"Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a heterogeneous cognitive disorder that is often comorbid with Parkinson’s diseases (PD). The amnestic subtype of PD-MCI (PD-aMCI) has a higher risk to develop dementia. However, there is a lack of studies on the white matter (WM) structural changes of PD-aMCI. We characterized the WM structural changes of PD-aMCI (n = 17) with cognitively normal PD (PD-CN, n = 19) and normal controls (n = 20), using voxel-based and tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) analyses on fractional anisotropy (FA) axial diffusivity (AD), and radial diffusivity (RD). By excluding and then including the motor performance as a covariate in the comparison analysis between PD-aMCI and PD-CN, we attempted to discern the influences of two neuropathological mechanisms on the WM structural changes of PD-aMCI. The correlation analyses between memory and voxel-based WM measures in all PD patients were also performed (n = 36). The results showed that PD-aMCI had smaller FA values than PD-CN in the diffuse WM areas, and PD-CN had higher AD and RD values than normal controls in the right caudate. Most FA difference between PD-aMCI and PD-CN could be weakened by the motor adjustment. The FA differences between PD-aMCI and PD-CN were largely spatially overlapped with the memory-correlated FA values. Our findings demonstrated that the WM structural differences between PD-aMCI and PD-CN were mainly memory-related, and the influence of motor adjustment might indicate a common mechanism underlying both motor and memory impairment in PD-aMCI, possibly reflecting a predominant influence of dopaminergic neuropathology."
https://openalex.org/W2995697016,"Mollusk shell matrix proteins are important for the formation of organic frameworks, crystal nucleation, and crystal growth in Pinctada fucata martensii (P. f. martensii). MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous small non-coding RNAs that play important roles in many biological processes, including shell formation. In this study, we obtained the full-length sequence of Pif97-like gene in P. f. martensii (PfmPif97-like). PfmPif97-like was mainly distributed in mantle pallial and mantle edge. Correlation analysis indicated that the average shell thickness and weight showed a positive correlation with PfmPif97-like expression (P < 0.05). The inner surface of the nacreous layer and prismatic layer showed atypical growth when we knocked down the expression of PfmPif97-like by RNA interference (RNAi). We used a luciferase reporter assay to identify that miR-9b-5p of P. f. martensii (Pfm-miR-9b-5p) downregulated the expression of PfmPif97-like by interacting with the 3′-untranslated region (UTR) while we obtained the same result by injecting the Pfm-miR-9b-5p mimics in vivo. After injecting the mimics, we also observed abnormal growth in nacre layer and prismatic layer which is consistent with the result of RNAi. We proposed that PfmPif97-like regulated by Pfm-miR-9b-5p participates in shell formation of P. f. martensii. These findings provide important clues about the molecular mechanisms that regulate biomineralization in P. f. martensii."
https://openalex.org/W2995850591,"It has been revealed that β-amyloid (Aβ) is generated and released from the presynaptic terminals in activity-dependent manner. However, molecules modulating the presynaptic Aβ generation remain elusive. Here we test the hypothesis that Synapsin 1 (Syn1) may acts as a modulator of the Aβ production. Using biochemical and Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based imaging approaches we have found that Syn1 knock down decreases, whereas (over)expression of Syn1 in cells increases the Aβ levels. Mechanistically, Syn1 does not seem to affect the activity of Presenilin 1 (PS1)/γ-secretase, PS1 conformation, or the proximity between PS1 and amyloid precursor protein (APP). However, we found that Syn1 is involved in up-regulation of the β-site APP cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1)/β-secretase activity and increases the APP/BACE1 interaction. Therefore, we conclude that Syn1 may promote Aβ production via the modulation of BACE1."
https://openalex.org/W2996622984,"Transtibial amputees may experience decreased quality of life due to increased risk of knee joint osteoarthritis (OA). No prior studies have compared knee joint biomechanics for the same group of transtibial amputees in gait, cycling, and elliptical training. Thus, the goal of this study was to identify preferred exercises for transtibial amputees in the context of reducing risk of knee OA. The hypotheses were: 1) knee biomechanics would differ due to participant status (amputee, control), exercise, and leg type (intact, residual) and 2) gait kinematic parameters would differ due to participant status and leg type. Ten unilateral transtibial amputee and ten control participants performed exercises while kinematic and kinetic data were collected. Two-factor repeated measures analysis of variance with post-hoc Tukey tests and non-parametric equivalents were performed to determine significance. Maximum knee compressive force, extension torque, and abduction torque were lowest in cycling and highest in gait regardless of participant type. Amputee maximum knee extension torque was higher in the intact vs. residual knee in gait. Amputee maximum knee flexion angle was higher in the residual vs. intact knee in gait and elliptical. Gait midstance knee flexion angle timing was asymmetrical for amputees and knee angle was lower in the amputee residual vs. control non-dominant knees. The results suggest that cycling, and likely other non-weight bearing exercises, may be preferred exercises for amputees due to significant reductions in biomechanical asymmetries and joint loads."
https://openalex.org/W2996733290,"The rubber tree [Hevea brasiliensis (Willd. Ex Adr. de Juss.) Muell.-Arg] is the main source of natural rubber in the world. However, in the Amazon region, its production is reduced by biotic and abiotic limitations, which have prompted breeding programs in order to identify desirable agronomic and physiological indicators. The objective of this study was to analyze the temporal dynamics of photosynthetic responses based on the parameters of leaf gas exchange and chlorophyll a fluorescence in 10 rubber tree clones during the immature phase (pre-tapping) in three large-scale clone trials, during daily cycles and under two climatic periods (dry and rainy) in the Caquetá region (Colombian Amazon). The variables A, LT, ΦPSII, ETR and qP were significantly higher in the dry period, where the highest values of PAR, AT and VPD were seen. In San Vicente del Caguán and Florencia, the highest averages were estimated for A, E and gs, as compared with Belén de los Andaquíes. In Florencia, the highest fluorescence parameters of chlorophyll a were recorded. At 9:00 h and 12:00 h, the highest means of A, E, ΦPSII and ETR were observed. The majority of the clones displayed the highest Fv/Fm mean (0.82–0.84) in the dry period. The clones FX 4098, FDR 4575, MDF 180, GU198 and FDR 5788 represent genotypes with the best photosynthetic performance (greater photosynthetic rates and better ability of the photosynthetic apparatus to capture, use and dissipate light energy). These desirable genotypes constitute a promising gene pool for expanding the genetic resource of rubber trees in the Colombian Amazon."
https://openalex.org/W2995125302,"In diffusion MRI, the advent of high angular resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI) and HARDI with compressed sensing (HARDI+CS) has led to clinically practical signal acquisition techniques which allow for the assessment of white matter architecture in routine patient studies. However, the reconstruction and visualization of fiber pathways by tractography has not yet been established as a standard methodology which can easily be applied. This is due to various algorithmic problems, such as a lack of robustness, error propagation and the necessity of fine-tuning parameters depending on the clinical question. In the framework of a clinical study of glioma patients, we compare two different whole-brain tracking methods to a local connectivity mapping approach which has recently shown promising results in an adaptation to diffusion MRI. The ability of the three methods to correctly depict fiber affection is analyzed by comparing visualization results to representations of local diffusion profiles provided by orientation distribution functions (ODFs). Our results suggest that methods beyond fiber tractography, which visualize local connectedness rather than global connectivity, should be evaluated further for pre-surgical assessment of fiber affection."

Current effects of the perceived safety culture on employee safety motivation and performance were also examined. A total of 883 workers from the five petrochemical companies, which were located in the Chugoku region of Japan, provided valid responses to the survey distributed by email. Structural equation modeling was used to evaluate the personnel safety culture in these industries. The endogenous variables considered in this study included petrochemical safety culture, personnel error behavior and personnel attitudes toward violation behaviors. Petrochemical personnel safety motivation was a mediating variable. This study’s findings highlight the importance of the perceived safety culture as a significant component of the organizational culture that influences employee behaviors and safety attitudes. This study further verifies the significant impact of the perceived safety culture in this industry sector on improving petrochemical personnel safety motivation and performance. Future research should explore the differences between the subcultures that have formed under larger safety cultures within similar high-risk industries, such as construction, aviation, manufacturing and mining."
https://openalex.org/W2995318413,"Background HPV test appears to be more effective in cervical cancer (CC) screening. However, the decision of its adoption as a primary screening method by substituting the established cytology lies in the evaluation of multiple criteria. Aim of this study is to evaluate the economic and clinical impact of HPV test as primary screening method for CC. Methods A decision tree and a Markov model were developed to simulate the screening algorithm and the natural history of CC. Fourteen different screening strategies were evaluated, for women 25–65 years old. Clinical inputs were drawn from the HERMES study and cost inputs from the official price lists. In the absence of CC treatment cost data, the respective Spanish costs were used after being converted to 2017 Greek values. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted. Results All screening strategies, that offer as primary screening method triennial HPV genotyping (simultaneous or reflex) alone or as co-testing with cytology appear to be more effective than all other strategies, with regards to both annual CC mortality, due to missed disease (-10.1), and CC incidence(-7.5) versus annual cytology (current practice). Of those, the strategy with HPV test with simultaneous 16/18 genotyping is the strategy that provides savings of 1.050 million euros annually. However, when the above strategy is offered quinquennially despite the fact that outcomes are decreased it remains more effective than current practice (-7.7 deaths and -1.3 incidence) and more savings per death averted (1.323 million) or incidence reduced (7.837 million) are realized. Conclusions HPV 16/18 genotyping as a primary screening method for CC appears to be one of the most effective strategies and dominates current practice in respect to both cost and outcomes. Even when compared with all other strategies, the outcomes that it generates justify the cost that it requires, representing a good value for money alternative."
https://openalex.org/W3005493529,"Background The diagnosis of sickle cell disease (SCD) is made by hemoglobin assays such as high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), isoelectric focusing and cellulose acetate or citrate agar electrophoresis. These assays are easy to perform and used in large-scale newborn screening in many countries. These tests however may not easily differentiate Sβ0 thalassemia from SS or identify other hemoglobin variants, and in this case, hemoglobin (HBB) gene sequencing may be necessary. Objectives To develop a high throughput DNA based confirmatory assay for SCD and to detect mutations in the HBB gene Methods We developed an automated pyrosequencing technique (PyS) based on QIAGEN technology (Hilden, Germany) to detect homozygous or heterozygous hemoglobin S mutations as well as hemoglobin C mutations. The technique was tested on 2,748 samples from patients enrolled in a multi-center SCD cohort in Brazil. Patients were previously tested using HPLC to diagnose SCD as part of routine clinical care. Any subjects with discrepant results between HPLC and PyS or with heterozygous hemoglobin S detected had Sanger sequencing of the HBB gene. Results We identified 168 samples with discrepant results between HPLC and PyS and 100 with concordant PyS = heterozygous S and HPLC, which would suggest SB-thalassemia or other heterozygous S variants. The PyS assay correctly identified 1906 (98.7%) of the 1930 HbSS and 628 (98.7%) of the 636 HbSC samples. Of the 179 remaining samples, PyS correctly indicated S heterozygosis in 165 (92.2%). Of the 165 heterozygous S samples confirmed by Sanger as consistent with Sβ thalassemia genotype, 84 samples were classified as Sβ0 thalassemia and 81 as Sβ+ thalassemia. The most frequent beta thalassemia mutations of Sβ0 and Sβ+ were HBB: c.118C>T (Gln40Stop) and HBB c.92 + 6T> C, respectively. Discussion The PyS proved to be satisfactory for large-scale confirmatory testing of hemoglobin mutation. Moreover, with this study we were able to describe the most common β+ and β0 mutations in SCD patients with Sβ-thalassemia in a large multi-institutional SCD cohort in Brazil."

Data on pituitary function in long-term follow-up after CD treatment in childhood is limited. Aim Long-term assessment of patients of the Children’s Memorial Health Institute (CMHI) after CD treatment in childhood. Materials and methods Retrospective analysis of 29 CD patients, mean age at the time of diagnosis 13.46 yrs. The long-term follow-up (FU) was done by: 1) obtaining the data from a patient’s questionnaire (75% of adult patients); 2) using the data from the last clinic visit for patients who did not respond to the questionnaire and for current CMHI patients. The average long-term FU from transsphenoidal pituitary surgery (TSS) was 10.23 yrs. Results At the latest FU: 18 patients (62%) had long-term disease remission after TSS1, 2 patients (6.9%) after TSS2, 1 patient (3.4%) after the post-TSS radiotherapy (XRT) cycle and 3 patients (10.3%) after bilateral adrenalectomy (BA). One patient (3.4%) died after TSS2 due to postoperative complications, 1 patient (3.4%) had persistent disease at latest FU, in 1 patient (3.4%) the long-term FU was not possible to perform. CD recurrence occurred in 4 out of 28 patients (14%) at an average time 3.6 yrs. from definitive treatment. One patient (3.4%) after BA was operated because of Nelson's syndrome. Two patients (6.9%) were suspected of relapse at latest assessment. At the time of the last evaluation, 17 patients (63%) were on levothyroxine therapy since definitive treatment, 16 patients (59%) were on hydrocortisone treatment, 10 patients (37%) were taking sex hormones replacement, 4 patients (15%)—antidiuretic hormone. Conclusions Relatively large number of patients after CD treatment in childhood have hormonal pituitary deficits as well as mood and cognitive disorders. CD recurrence can occur even after a long time post effective treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2994893044,"Vancomycin resistant enterococci (VRE) belong to the most common causes of nosocomial infections worldwide. It has been reported that use of the glycopeptide growth promoter avoparcin selected for a significant livestock-reservoir of VRE in many European countries, including Norway. However, although avoparcin was banned as a feed-additive in 1995, VRE have for unknown reasons consistently been reported in samples from Norwegian broilers. When avoparcin was banned, broiler-feed was supplemented with the polyether ionophore narasin in order to control the diseases coccidiosis and the frequent sequela necrotic enteritis. A potential link between transferrable vancomycin resistance and reduced susceptibility to narasin was recently reported. The use of narasin as a feed additive was abolished by the Norwegian broiler industry in 2016 and since then, broilers have been reared without in-feed antibacterial supplements. In this study, we demonstrate that all VRE isolates from Norwegian broilers collected in 2006–2014 displayed reduced susceptibility to narasin. Surveillance data collected two years after the narasin abolishment show a significant reduction in VRE, below the detection limit of the surveillance method, and a concurrent marked reduction in Enterococcus faecium with reduced susceptibility to narasin. The significant decline of E. faecium with reduced susceptibility to these antimicrobial compounds also coincided with an increased focus on cleaning and disinfection between broiler flocks. Furthermore, data from a controlled in vivo experiment using Ross 308 broilers indicate that the proportion of E. faecium with reduced susceptibility to narasin was heavily reduced in broilers fed a narasin-free diet compared to a diet supplemented with narasin. Our results are consistent with that the abolishment of this feed additive, possibly in combination with the increased focus on cleaning and disinfection, has had a substantial impact on the occurrence of VRE in the Norwegian broiler population."
https://openalex.org/W2995672840,"Predicting overt hepatic encephalopathy (OHE) is important because the condition is frequent, often requires hospitalization and is potentially preventable. The risk of OHE is related to pre-existing discrete cognitive defects, and for clinical practice it is recommended to apply two different psychometric tests to detect such deficits. We used the continuous reaction time test (CRT) and the portosystemic encephalopathy (PSE) syndrome test and examined their single and combined value for OHE prediction in cirrhosis patients.We studied 130 clinically mentally unimpaired cirrhosis patients by the two tests and followed them for an average of 38.5 months. The CRT measures velocity and stability of motor reaction times to 150 repeated auditory signals. The PSE is a five sub-set paper-and-pencil test battery evaluating cognitive and psychomotor processing, speed and vision-motor coordination. We collected data on episodes of OHE during follow-up. The clinical course was analysed in patient groups according to the outcome of each test and of both tests together. No anti-HE treatment was initiated except for cases with OHE.At baseline, the CRT test was abnormal in 74 patients and the PSE in 47. During follow-up 35 patients (27%) experienced 74 OHE events. 23 patients with abnormal CRT experienced OHE (prediction sensitivity 65%). The PSE predicted OHE in 14 patients (prediction sensitivity 40%). One or both tests were abnormal in 87/130 (67%) and this predicted OHE in 27 patients (21%) (prediction sensitivity 77%).The CRT test was clinically useful in identifying two-thirds of clinically mentally unimpaired cirrhosis patients who later experienced OHE, and the use of both the CRT and PSE showed satisfactory prediction by identifying three-fourths of later OHE cases."
https://openalex.org/W2996475989,"The plethora of restriction factors with the ability to inhibit the replication of retroviruses have been widely studied and genetic hallmarks of evolutionary selective pressures in Primates have been well documented. One example is the tripartite motif-containing protein 5 alpha (TRIM5α), a cytoplasmic factor that restricts retroviral infection in a species-specific fashion. In Lagomorphs, similarly to what has been observed in Primates, the specificity of TRIM5 restriction has been assigned to the PRYSPRY domain. In this study, we present the first insight of an intra-genus variability within the Lagomorpha TRIM5 PRYSPRY domain. Remarkably, and considering just the 32 residue-long v1 region of this domain, the deduced amino acid sequences of Daurian pika (Ochotona dauurica) and steppe pika (O. pusilla) evidenced a high divergence when compared to the remaining Ochotona species, presenting values of 44% and 66% of amino acid differences, respectively. The same evolutionary pattern was also observed when comparing the v1 region of two Sylvilagus species members (47% divergence). However, and unexpectedly, the PRYSPRY domain of Lepus species exhibited a great conservation. Our results show a high level of variation in the PRYSPRY domain of Lagomorpha species that belong to the same genus. This suggests that, throughout evolution, the Lagomorpha TRIM5 should have been influenced by constant selective pressures, likely as a result of multiple different retroviral infections."

https://openalex.org/W2996701264,"There is a trade-off between reproductive effort and adult longevity, and when resource allocation is taken into account, it is especially pronounced in species that have aphagous adult forms. This trade-off may be further complicated by environmental factors such as nutrient availability during larval development and by the other sex, which influences the costs of reproduction due to the presentation of nuptial gifts. Here, we examined the influence of larval nutrient quantity on the sex-specific longevity costs of reproduction in the gift-giving seed beetle Callosobruchus maculatus. We found no indication that differences in the nutrient quality of larger and smaller host seeds influence survival in virgin and reproducing individuals or nuptial gift size in reproducing individuals. However, in the case of reproducing individuals, the effect of seed size on survival was statistically marginal. Therefore, we advise taking this into account when investigating reproductive efforts in this species. We have also observed interesting interactions between male and female reproductive costs. While females had generally higher mortality than males, nuptial gifts resulted in lowered female mortality and increased male mortality. Additionally, we found a possibly non-linear relationship between nuptial gift size and the offspring production rate of female recipients."
https://openalex.org/W2995446952,"During a mass media campaign accompanying the launch of the Maximum Diva Woman’s Condom (WC) in Lusaka, Zambia, a cluster-randomized evaluation was implemented to measure the added impact of a peer-led interpersonal communication (IPC) intervention on the awareness and uptake of the new female condom (FC). The WC and mass media campaign were introduced simultaneously in 40 urban wards in April 2016; half of the wards were randomly assigned to the treatment (IPC intervention) with cross-sectional surveys conducted before (n = 2,364) and one year after (n = 2,430) the start of the intervention. A pre-specified intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis measured the impact of randomization to IPC at the community level. In adjusted ITT models, there were no statistically significant differences between intervention and control groups. Due to significant implementation challenges, we also conducted exploratory secondary analyses to estimate effects among those who attended an IPC event (n = 66) using instrumental variable and inverse probability weighting analyses. In addition to increases in FC identification (IPC attendees had higher reported use of any condom, improved perceptions of FC’s, and were more likely to have discussed contraceptive use with their partner as compared to non-attendees). The introduction of a new FC product combined with an IPC intervention significantly increased general knowledge and awareness in the community as compared to media alone, but did not lead to detectable community level impacts on other primary outcomes of interest. Observational evidence from our study suggests that IPC attendance is associated with increased use and negotiation. Future studies should explore the intensity and duration of IPC programming necessary to achieve detectable community level impacts on behavior. Trial Registration: AEARCTR-0000899"
https://openalex.org/W2996266373,"Background Spinal anesthesia is a form of regional anesthesia frequently used in various lower abdominal, orthopedic, obstetric operations such as a cesarean delivery. The most common local anesthetic used for spinal anesthesia in obstetric and non-obstetric surgery is bupivacaine which can be utilized as an isobaric or hyperbaric solution, producing differences in maternal hemodynamic changes. Against this backdrop, the study aims to compare the effects of isobaric and hyperbaric bupivacaine on maternal hemodynamic alterations after administering spinal anesthesia for elective cesarean delivery at Gandhi Memorial Hospital, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Methods A hospital-based prospective cohort study design was employed for the period December 1, 2017 to January 30, 2018. A total of 100 parturient were involved, with one group exposed to isobaric bupivacaine and the other to hyperbaric bupivacaine to observe their effects on maternal hemodynamic changes post spinal anesthesia. The participants were selected through systematic random sampling. Data analysis was performed using SPSS (version 20) through descriptive statistic, independent sample t-test, Mann-Whitney U-test, Fisher’s exact test, and Chi-square test were used. P values of <0.05 was assumed as statistically significant for all tests. Results The incidence of hypotension was found to be greater in isobaric than hyperbaric groups (82% vs. 60% respectively; p = 0.015). No statistical significant differences were found in mean arterial pressure value at baseline, but, statistically significant changes were observed among the groups (p <0.05) at all study timing after spinal anesthesia, except at 30thmin. No statistically significant differences were seen in the mean heart rate variability after spinal anesthesia at all periods, except the 15th minute (p = 0.033). A greater rate of vasopressor was used in the isobaric group as compared to the hyperbaric group (36% vs. 14% respectively; p = 0.011). Conclusion Baricity is a significant factor in maternal hemodynamic changes in the parturient for elective cesarean section. Isobaric bupivacaine produces greater change in blood pressure and incidence of hypotension and entails a greater vasopressor requirement than hyperbaric bupivacaine after spinal anesthesia for elective cesarean section."

Furthermore, it can be altered by individual experience, even when using existing measurement methods for the multidimensional axis of odor such as odor profiling. It is, therefore, necessary to characterize patterns of odor quality with odor profiling and observe alterations in odor profiles under the influence of subjective rating conditions such as verbal cues. Considering the high performance of human odor categorization, we hypothesized that odor may have specific odor quality that is scarcely altered by verbal cues. We assessed odor responses to isovaleric acid with and without verbal cues and compared the results in each stimulation condition. We found that verbal cues influenced the rating of odor quality descriptors. Verbal cues weakly influenced the odor quality descriptors of high-rated value (upper 25%) compared to odor quality descriptors of low-rated value (lower 75%) by the survey test. Even under different verbal cue conditions, the same odor was classified in the same class when using high-rated odor quality descriptors. Our study suggests that people extract essential odor quality descriptors that represent the odor itself in order to efficiently quantify odor quality."

We calculated the proportion of babies in NNRD (aged <1 year and admitted between 2010-2017) with a BSI caused by clearly pathogenic organisms between two days after admission and two days after discharge. We used Poisson regression to determine trends in the proportion of babies with BSI based on i) deterministic and probabilistic linkage of NNRD and surveillance data (primary measure), ii) deterministic linkage of NNRD-surveillance data, iii) NNRD records alone, and iv) linked NNRD-surveillance data augmented with clinical records of laboratory-confirmed BSI in NNRD.Using deterministic and probabilistic linkage, 5,629 of 349,740 babies admitted to a NNU in NNRD linked with 6,660 BSI episodes accounting for 38% of 17,388 BSI records aged <1 year in surveillance data. The proportion of babies with BSI due to clearly pathogenic organisms during their NNU admission was 1.0% using deterministic plus probabilistic linkage (primary measure), compared to 1.0% using deterministic linkage alone, 0.6% using NNRD records alone, and 1.2% using linkage augmented with clinical records of BSI in NNRD. Equivalent proportions for babies born before 32 weeks of gestation were 5.0%, 4.8%, 2.9% and 5.9%. The proportion of babies who linked to a BSI decreased by 7.5% each year (95% confidence interval [CI]: -14.3%, -0.1%) using deterministic and probabilistic linkage but was stable using clinical records of BSI or deterministic linkage alone.Linkage that combines BSI records from national laboratory surveillance and clinical NNU data sources, and use of probabilistic methods, substantially improved ascertainment of BSI and estimates of BSI trends over time, compared with single data sources."
https://openalex.org/W2998058627,"The demographic profile of the biomedical workforce in the U.S. does not reflect the population at large, raising concerns that there will be insufficient trained researchers in the future, and the scope of research interests will not be sufficiently broad. To diversify and expand the pool of researchers trained to conduct research on cancer and cancer health disparities, a series of training activities to recruit and train primarily Hispanic students at both the undergraduate and graduate level were developed. The strengths of both a Hispanic Serving Institution and an NIH-designated Comprehensive Cancer Center were leveraged to develop appropriate research training and professional development activities. The career progression of the participants and degree completion rates was tracked, along with persistent interest in biomedical research in general and cancer and cancer health disparities research in particular for these underrepresented individuals. Finally, this report demonstrates that these training activities increased general knowledge about cancer among participants."
https://openalex.org/W2995404548,"To what extent are low-level visual and attentional phenomena related to higher-level personality traits? Trait self-control is thought to modulate behavior via two separate mechanisms: 1) by preventing initial temptation and, 2) by inhibiting temptation when it occurs (disengagement). Similarly, the control of visual attention often entails preventing initial distraction by irrelevant but tempting (goal-similar) objects, and disengaging attention when it has been inappropriately captured. Given these similarities, we examined whether individuals higher versus lower in trait self-control would differ in their susceptibility to attention capture using mouse-tracking as a sensitive, online measure of how attentional dynamics resolve over time and space in response to a distracting visual cue. Using a variety of metrics of attention capture, we found that differences among people in trait self-control did not predict initial selection of visual information nor subsequent disengagement. Overall, these results suggest that trait self-control and attention capture operate via separate mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2995735319,"Total variation (TV) based models are very popular in image denoising but suffer from some drawbacks. For example, local TV methods often cannot preserve edges and textures well when they face excessive smoothing. Non-local TV methods constitute an alternative, but their computational cost is huge. To overcome these issues, we propose an image denoising method named non-local patch graph total variation (NPGTV). Its main originality stands for the graph total variation method, which combines the total variation with graph signal processing. Schematically, we first construct a K-nearest graph from the original image using a non-local patch-based method. Then the model is solved with the Douglas-Rachford Splitting algorithm. By doing so, the image details can be well preserved while being denoised. Experiments conducted on several standard natural images illustrate the effectiveness of our method when compared to some other state-of-the-art denoising methods like classical total variation, non-local means filter (NLM), non-local graph based transform (NLGBT), adaptive graph-based total variation (AGTV)."
https://openalex.org/W2996355234,"Volition and sense of agency are two primary components of a voluntary or internally generated movement. It has been shown that movement selection cannot be altered without interfering with the sense of volition using single pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation over the primary motor cortex. In the current study, we aimed at examining whether modulating the cortical excitability of the final effector in the voluntary motor pathway—the primary motor cortex, using transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) would alter movement selection. Our hypothesis was that anodal tDCS would increase motor cortical excitability and thereby decrease the threshold for movement execution, which could favor selection of the contralateral hand. We recruited 13 healthy adults to perform a movement selection task involving free-choice and externally-cued trials while applying real/sham tDCS in a C3-C4 dual-hemispheric electrode montage. Contrary to our hypothesis, we did not observe any effect of tDCS on movement selection either at the individual or group level. However, our data confirms the strong preference of right-handed individuals for the dominant right hand. We also found higher reaction time for internally generated movement compared to externally triggered movement. We therefore conclude that movement selection cannot be influenced at the level of primary motor cortex and that brain areas upstream of the primary motor cortex in the voluntary motor pathway may be possible targets for influencing movement selection."
https://openalex.org/W2951767242,"In two experiments with large samples of participants, we explored contextual memory effects associated with body posture, which was considered a physical and proprioceptive context and, therefore, potentially relevant to the encoding and retrieval of information. In Experiment 1 (N = 128), we studied the effect of context dependence on memory by manipulating the body posture adopted by the participants during the incidental encoding and subsequent recall of a series of action sentences not intrinsically associated with particular body postures (e.g., ""to put on a pair of glasses"", ""to look at a postcard""). Memory performance was not affected by context manipulation, as reflected by the absence of significant differences between remembering while in the posture adopted at study or in a different posture. Experiment 2 (N = 85) was designed to analyze context congruency memory effects, and for that purpose we manipulated the participants' body posture during the recall of sentences that described actions usually performed in body postures that were congruent or incongruent with the posture of the participants (e.g., recalling the sentence ""to travel by taxi"" while sitting or while standing). A content-neutral posture (lying) was used for the incidental encoding phase. Memory performance was not affected by contextual congruency at the time of recall, as evidenced by the lack of significant differences between recalling in a posture congruent with the content to be recalled and recalling in an alternative posture. Bayesian analyses supported the strength of null findings in the two experiments, adding to the evidence that, when taken together, the results in this study clearly failed to show contextual memory effects of body posture on the recall of action-related verbal statements."
https://openalex.org/W2995051573,"Objective Given rising incidence of Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis (GC/CT), development of efficacious screening strategies is critical to interruption of the infection cycle. However, a small proportion of nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT) results are inconclusive—resulting in delays in diagnosis and treatment. As such, this study seeks to evaluate factors associated with inconclusive rectal GC/CT NAAT. Methods This is a retrospective chart review of individuals who received an inconclusive rectal GC/CT NAAT result at a single institution from 3/2016-6/2018. Inconclusive GC/CT NAAT was defined as presence of PCR amplification inhibitors using Roche Cobas v2.0 CT/NG assay. Clinical charts were abstracted for age, gender, HIV status, GC/CT (urogenital, rectal, pharyngeal) and syphilis screening results during the study period, clinic type (HIV clinic, university student health center, other), and whether repeat testing occurred within 6 months following an inconclusive result. Logistic regression analysis was used to calculate adjusted and unadjusted odds ratios of factors associated with receipt of repeat testing following an inconclusive rectal GC/CT NAAT result. Results During the study period, 6.1% (852/14,015) of rectal GC/CT NAAT were inconclusive for one or both of GC and CT. Among the 413 patients whose inconclusive rectal GC/CT NAAT results that were included in our analysis, 66.6% (275/413) received repeat testing within 6 months, of which 8.7% (24/275) were positive (compared to 5.4% positivity rate of all rectal samples). In multivariable analysis, individuals living with HIV had lower odds of receiving repeat testing following inconclusive rectal GC/CT NAAT compared to HIV uninfected individuals (adj OR 0.25; p = 0.001). Conclusions Despite being disproportionately affected by the STI epidemic, individuals living with HIV had 75% lower odds of receiving repeat testing following inconclusive rectal GC/CT NAAT compared to HIV-uninfected individuals, representing potentially missed opportunities for treatment and prevention of ongoing STI transmission."
https://openalex.org/W2995338703,"Neuroscience as a discipline is rarely covered in educational institutions in Puerto Rico. In an effort to overcome this deficit we developed the Bridge to Neuroscience Workshop (BNW), a full-day hands-on workshop in neuroscience education. BNW was conceived as an auxiliary component of a parent recruitment program called Bridge to the PhD in Neuroscience Program (BPNP). The objectives of BNW are to identify promising students for BPNP, and to increase awareness of neuroscience as a discipline and a career option. BNW introduces basic concepts in neuroscience using a variety of educational techniques, including mini-lectures, interactive discussions, case studies, experimentation, and a sheep brain dissection. Since its inception in 2011 BNW has undergone a series of transformations that continue to improve upon an already successful and influential educational program for underrepresented minorities. As of Fall 2018, we have presented 21 workshops, impacting 200 high school and 424 undergraduate students. BNW has been offered at University of Puerto Rico (UPR)-Arecibo, UPR-Cayey, UPR-Humacao, Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Ponce, and Universidad Interamericana de Puerto Rico-Arecibo. A pre-and post evaluation was given to evaluate material comprehension and thus measure effectiveness of our one-day interactive workshop. Our results suggest that both high school and undergraduate students have little prior knowledge of neuroscience, and that participation in BNW improves not only understanding, but also enthusiasm for the discipline. Currently, our assessment has only been able to evaluate short-term effects (e.g. comprehension and learning). Therefore, our current focus is developing methods capable of determining how participation in BNW impacts future academic and career decisions."
https://openalex.org/W2996519589,"An interaction of laser pulse, containing a few cycles, with substance is a modern problem, attracting attention of many researches. The frequency conversion is a key problem for a generation of such pulses in various ranges of frequencies. Adequate description of such pulse interaction with a medium is based on a slowly evolving wave approximation (SEWA), which has been proposed earlier for a description of propagation of the laser pulse, containing a few cycles, in a medium with cubic nonlinear response. Despite widely applicability of the frequency conversion for various nonlinear optics problems solutions, SEWA has not been applied and developed for a theoretical investigation of the frequency doubling process until present time. In this study the set of generalized nonlinear Schrödinger equations describing a second harmonic generation of the super-short femtosecond pulse is derived. The equations set contains terms, describing the pulses self-steepening, and the second order dispersion (SOD) of the pulse, a diffraction of the beam as well as mixed derivatives. We propose the transform of the equations set to a type, which does not contain both the mixed derivatives and time derivatives of the nonlinear terms. This transform allows us to derive the integrals of motion of the problem: energy, spectral invariants and Hamiltonian. We show the existence of two specific frequencies (singularities in the Fourier space) inherent to the problem. They may cause an appearance of non-physical absolute instability of the problem solution if the spectral invariants are not taken into account. Moreover, we claim that the energy preservation at the laser pulses propagation may not occur if these invariants do not preserve. Developed conservation laws, in particular, have to be used for developing of the conservative finite-difference schemes, preserving the conservation laws difference analogues, and for developing of adequate theory of the modulation instability of the laser pulses, containing a few cycles."
