https://openalex.org/W2001210466,"Transgenic mice overexpressing the 695-amino acid isoform of human Alzheimer beta-amyloid (Abeta) precursor protein containing a Lys670 --> Asn, Met671 --> Leu mutation had normal learning and memory in spatial reference and alternation tasks at 3 months of age but showed impairment by 9 to 10 months of age. A fivefold increase in Abeta(1-40) and a 14-fold increase in Abeta(1-42/43) accompanied the appearance of these behavioral deficits. Numerous Abeta plaques that stained with Congo red dye were present in cortical and limbic structures of mice with elevated amounts of Abeta. The correlative appearance of behavioral, biochemical, and pathological abnormalities reminiscent of Alzheimer's disease in these transgenic mice suggests new opportunities for exploring the pathophysiology and neurobiology of this disease."
https://openalex.org/W2137590150,"The cytokine-induced activation cascade of NF-kappaB in mammals and the activation of the morphogen dorsal in Drosophila embryos show striking structural and functional similarities (Toll/IL-1, Cactus/I-kappaB, and dorsal/NF-kappaB). Here we demonstrate that these parallels extend to the immune response of Drosophila. In particular, the intracellular components of the dorsoventral signaling pathway (except for dorsal) and the extracellular Toll ligand, spätzle, control expression of the antifungal peptide gene drosomycin in adults. We also show that mutations in the Toll signaling pathway dramatically reduce survival after fungal infection. Antibacterial genes are induced either by a distinct pathway involving the immune deficiency gene (imd) or by combined activation of both imd and dorsoventral pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2067069532,"Identification and characterization of antigen-specific T lymphocytes during the course of an immune response is tedious and indirect. To address this problem, the peptide-major histocompatability complex (MHC) ligand for a given population of T cells was multimerized to make soluble peptide-MHC tetramers. Tetramers of human lymphocyte antigen A2 that were complexed with two different human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-derived peptides or with a peptide derived from influenza A matrix protein bound to peptide-specific cytotoxic T cells in vitro and to T cells from the blood of HIV-infected individuals. In general, tetramer binding correlated well with cytotoxicity assays. This approach should be useful in the analysis of T cells specific for infectious agents, tumors, and autoantigens."
https://openalex.org/W2042982622,"The adult hematopoietic system of mammals is a dynamic hierarchy of cells with the hematopoietic stem cell at its foundation. During embryonic development, the source and expansion potential of this cell remain unclear. Two sites of hematopoietic activity, the yolk sac and aorta–gonad–mesonephros (AGM) region, function in mouse ontogeny at the pre-liver stage of hematopoiesis. However, cellular interchange between these tissues obscures the embryonic site of hematopoietic stem cell generation. Here we present the results of a novel in vitro organ culture system demonstrating that, at day 10 in gestation, hematopoietic stem cells initiate autonomously and exclusively within the AGM region. Furthermore, we provide evidence for the in vitro expansion of hematopoietic stem cells within the AGM region. These results strongly suggest that the AGM region is the source of the definitive adult hematopoietic system, which subsequently colonizes the liver."
https://openalex.org/W2079092292,"The comprehension of visually presented sentences produces brain activation that increases with the linguistic complexity of the sentence. The volume of neural tissue activated (number of voxels) during sentence comprehension was measured with echo-planar functional magnetic resonance imaging. The modulation of the volume of activation by sentence complexity was observed in a network of four areas: the classical left-hemisphere language areas (the left laterosuperior temporal cortex, or Wernicke's area, and the left inferior frontal gyrus, or Broca's area) and their homologous right-hemisphere areas, although the right areas had much smaller volumes of activation than did the left areas. These findings generally indicate that the amount of neural activity that a given cognitive process engenders is dependent on the computational demand that the task imposes."
https://openalex.org/W2038879792,"In response to visual stimulation, a subset of neurons in the striate and prestriate cortex displays synchronous rhythmic firing in the gamma frequency band (20 to 70 hertz). This finding has raised two fundamental questions: What is the functional significance of synchronous gamma-band activity and how is it generated? This report addresses the second of these two questions. By means of intracellular recording and staining of single cells in the cat striate cortex in vivo, a biophysically distinct class of pyramidal neuron termed ""chattering cells"" is described. These neurons are located in the superficial layers of the cortex, intrinsically generate 20- to 70-hertz repetitive burst firing in response to suprathreshold depolarizing current injection, and exhibit pronounced oscillations in membrane potential during visual stimulation that are largely absent during periods of spontaneous activity. These properties suggest that chattering cells may make a substantial intracortical contribution to the generation of synchronous cortical oscillations and thus participate in the recruitment of large populations of cells into synchronously firing assemblies."
https://openalex.org/W2051948296,"Targeting of most nuclear proteins to the cell nucleus is initiated by interaction between the classical nuclear localization signals (NLSs) contained within them and the importin NLS receptor complex. We have recently delineated a novel 38 amino acid transport signal in the hnRNP A1 protein, termed M9, which confers bidirectional transport across the nuclear envelope. We show here that M9-mediated nuclear import occurs by a novel pathway that is independent of the well-characterized, importin-mediated classical NLS pathway. Additionally, we have identified a specific M9-interacting protein, termed transportin, which binds to wild-type M9 but not to transport-defective M9 mutants. Transportin is a 90 kDa protein, distantly related to importin β, and we show that it mediates the nuclear import of M9-containing proteins. These findings demonstrate that there are at least two receptor-mediated nuclear protein import pathways. Furthermore, as hnRNP A1 likely participates in mRNA export, it raises the possibility that transportin is a mediator of this process as well."
https://openalex.org/W2031945557,"Emergence of hemopoietic stem cells in the mammalian embryo has yet to be definitively allocated. Previously, we detected multipotent hemopoietic precursors in the region surrounding the dorsal aorta (paraaortic splanchnopleura) beginning at 8.5 days postcoitum (dpc). However, as circulation is already established, it remained unclear whether hemopoietic precursors arise in situ or are blood-delivered. By adding an organotypic step to our former culture system, we now detect lymphocyte and multipotent myeloid precursors from the intraembryonic splanchnopleura as early as 7.5 dpc. Under identical conditions, yolk sacs from the same embryos are unable to generate lymphoid progeny and have a reduced potential for myeloid differentiation and maintenance. Thus, if isolated before circulation, the yolk sac does not produce multipotent precursors and therefore does not contribute to definitive hemopoiesis in the mouse."

Although several genetic causes are known for B+ SCID, the etiology of B− SCID has not been defined. Six of 14 B− SCID patients tested were found to carry a mutation of the recombinase activating gene 1 (RAG-1), RAG-2, or both. This mutation resulted in a functional inability to form antigen receptors through genetic recombination and links a defect in one of the site-specific recombination systems to a human disease."
https://openalex.org/W1993201799,"The eukaryotic 20S proteasome is responsible for the degradation of many cellular proteins, but how it is assembled and how its distinct active sites are formed are not understood. Like other proteasome subunits, the yeast Doa3 protein is synthesized in precursor form. We show that the N-terminal propeptide is required for Doa3 incorporation into the proteasome and, remarkably, that the propeptide functions in trans, suggesting it serves a chaperone-like function in proteasome biogenesis. Propeptide processing is not required for proteasome assembly but is needed for maturation of a specific subset of active sites. The likely nucleophile for these sites is provided by the N-terminal threonine of mature Doa3. Additional data indicate that precursor processing is autocatalytic and requires association of the two halves of the proteasome particle, thereby preventing formation of proteolytic sites until the central hydrolytic chamber has been sealed off from the rest of the cell."
https://openalex.org/W2135935249,"The initiation of intracellular signaling events through the 55 kDa tumor necrosis factor-receptor (TNF-R55) appears to depend on protein intermediates that interact with specific cytoplasmic domains of TNF-R55. By combined use of the yeast interaction trap system and a peptide scanning library, the novel WD-repeat protein FAN has been identified, which specifically binds to a cytoplasmic nine amino acid binding motif of TNF-R55. This region has been previously recognized as a distinct functional domain that is both required and sufficient for the activation of neutral sphingomyelinase (N-SMase). Overexpression of full-length FAN enhanced N-SMase activity in TNF-treated cells, while truncated mutants of FAN produced dominant negative effects. The data suggest that FAN regulates ceramide production by N-SMase, which is a crucial step in TNF signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2009238064,"DNA repair in the eukaryotic cell disrupts local chromatin organization. To investigate whether the resetting of nucleosomal arrays can be linked to the repair process, we developed model systems, with both Xenopus egg extract and human cell extracts, to follow repair and chromatin assembly in parallel on circular DNA templates. Both systems were able to carry out nucleotide excision repair of DNA lesions. We observed that UV-dependent DNA synthesis occurs simultaneously with chromatin assembly, strongly indicating a mechanistic coupling between the two processes. A complementation assay established that chromatin assembly factor I (CAF1) is necessary for this repair associated chromatin formation."
https://openalex.org/W2126768186,"The red blood cell (RBC) membrane protein AE1 provides high affinity binding sites for the membrane skeleton, a structure critical to RBC integrity. AE1 biosynthesis is postulated to be required for terminal erythropoiesis and membrane skeleton assembly. We used targeted mutagenesis to assess AE1 function in vivo. RBCs lacking AE1 spontaneously shed membrane vesicles and tubules, leading to severe spherocytosis and hemolysis, but the levels of the major skeleton components, the synthesis of spectrin in mutant erythroblasts, and skeletal architecture are normal or nearly normal. The results indicate that AE1 does not regulate RBC membrane skeleton assembly in vivo but is essential for membrane stability. We postulate that stabilization is achieved through AE1–lipid interactions and that loss of these interactions is a key pathogenic event in hereditary spherocytosis."
https://openalex.org/W2020651808,"The mechanism by which mammalian nucleotide excision repair (NER) detects a wide range of base lesions is poorly understood. Here, we tested the ability of human NER to recognize bulky modifications that either destabilize the DNA double helix (acetylaminofluorene (AAF) and benzo[<i>a</i>]pyrene diol-epoxide (BPDE) adducts, UV radiation products) or induce opposite effects by stabilizing the double helix (8-methoxypsoralen (8-MOP), anthramycin, and CC-1065 adducts). We constructed plasmid DNA carrying a defined number of each of these adducts and determined their potential to sequester NER factors contained in a human cell-free extract. For that purpose, we measured the capacity of damaged plasmids to compete with excision repair of a site-directed NER substrate. This novel approach showed differences of more than 3 orders of magnitude in the efficiency by which helix-destabilizing and helix-stabilizing adducts sequester NER factors. For example, AAF modifications were able to compete with the NER substrate ~1740 times more effectively than 8-MOP adducts. The sequestration potency decreased with the following order of adducts, AAF > UV ≥ BPDE > 8-MOP > anthramycin, CC-1065. A strong preference for helix-destabilizing lesions was confirmed by monitoring the formation of NER patches at site-specific adducts with either AAF or CC-1065. This comparison based on factor sequestration and repair synthesis indicates that human NER is primarily targeted to sites at which the secondary structure of DNA is destabilized. Thus, an early step of DNA damage recognition involves thermodynamic probing of the duplex."
https://openalex.org/W2025165483,"Afg3p and Rca1p are adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-dependent metalloproteases in yeast mitochondria. Cells lacking both proteins exhibit defects in respiration-dependent growth, degradation of mitochondrially synthesized proteins, and assembly of inner-membrane complexes. Defects in growth and protein assembly, but not in degradation, were suppressed by overproduction of yeast mitochondrial Lon, an ATP-dependent serine protease. Suppression by Lon was enhanced by inactivation of the proteolytic site and was prevented by mutation of the ATP-binding site. It is suggested that the mitochondrial proteases Lon, Afg3p, and Rca1p can also serve a chaperone-like function in the assembly of mitochondrial protein complexes."
https://openalex.org/W2063521424,"Hepatitis delta virus (HDV) is a pathogenic human virus whose RNA genome and replication cycle resemble those of plant viroids. However, viroid genomes contain no open reading frames, whereas HDV RNA encodes a single protein, hepatitis delta antigen (HDAg), which is required for viral replication. A cellular gene whose product interacts with HDAg has now been identified, and this interaction was found to affect viral genomic replication in intact cells. DNA sequence analysis revealed that this protein, termed delta-interacting protein A (DIPA), is a cellular homolog of HDAg. These observations demonstrate that a host gene product can modulate HDV replication and suggest that HDV may have evolved from a primitive viroidlike RNA through capture of a cellular transcript."
https://openalex.org/W2090544281,"Previously the role of invariant chain (Ii) had been described only as a chaperone that facilitates folding and transport of major histocompatability complex class II molecules; here it is shown that Ii is required for B cell development. B cells from mice lacking Ii were found to have a low response to T-independent type II antigen and could not proliferate after the mice were injected with antigen. Study of cell surface markers revealed a developmental arrest that prevented immature virgin B cells from becoming mature B cells in the periphery. This block was independent of major histocompatability complex class II expression and was an intrinsic feature of B cells that correlated with the amount of Ii. Thus, Ii participates by an unknown mechanism in B cell maturation."

https://openalex.org/W2012323430,"Thermoregulation of the thorax allows endothermic insects to achieve power outputs during flight that are among the highest in the animal kingdom. Flying endothermic insects, including the honeybee Apis mellifera, are believed to thermoregulate almost exclusively by varying heat loss. Here it is shown that a rise in air temperature from 20° to 40°C causes large decreases in metabolic heat production and wing-beat frequency in honeybees during hovering, agitated, or loaded flight. Thus, variation in heat production may be the primary mechanism for achieving thermal stability in flying honeybees, and this mechanism may occur commonly in endothermic insects."

The enzyme is soluble and its substrate, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), is present in phospholipid membranes. A potential mechanism for regulation of this enzyme is through influencing the equilibrium association of the enzyme with membrane surfaces. In this paper we describe a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) method for measuring the association of PLC β2 with phospholipid bilayers. The method allows equilibrium measurements to be made under a variety of conditions, including those that support enzymatic activity and ability to be regulated by G proteins. Using this method it was found that PLC β2 bound to vesicles containing anionic lipids and demonstrated a selective and unique interaction with PIP2-containing vesicles. The FRET data were corroborated with a centrifugation based method for estimating the affinity of PLC β2 for vesicles. Apparently different modes of association of PLC β2 with vesicles of different composition can be distinguished based on alterations in resonance energy transfer efficiency.

https://openalex.org/W1988267408,"We investigated a herpesvirus mutant that contains a single base insertion in its thymidine kinase (tk) gene yet expresses low levels of TK via a net +1 translational recoding event. Within this mutant gene, we defined a G-rich signal that is sufficient to induce recoding. Unlike other translational recoding events, downstream RNA structures or termination codons did not stimulate recoding, and paused ribosomes were not detected. Mutational analysis indicated that specific tRNAs or codon–anticodon slippage were unlikely to account for recoding. Rather, recoding efficiency correlated with the G-richness of the signal and its ability to form unusual structures. These findings identify a mechanism of translational recoding with unique features and potential implications for clinical drug resistance and other biological systems."

The C terminus of these proteins contains an extension of approximately 30 amino acids not present in other members of the Ras family and which exhibits all the hallmarks typical for calmodulin (CaM)-binding domains. A peptide corresponding to the putative CaM-binding domain of the Kir/Gem protein was synthesized, and its affinity for CaM was determined by fluorescence spectrometry. Titration of dansyl-CaM with the Kir/Gem peptide gave an affinity constant of 1 nM. Furthermore, a single point mutation of the peptide, W269G, abolished this high affinity interaction. Gel-shift analysis showed that the complex formation between CaM and the Kir/Gem peptide is strictly calcium-dependent. We also demonstrate with a newly developed [32P]CaM overlay technique that full-length Kir/Gem and Rad proteins bind CaM in a Ca2+-dependent fashion.

https://openalex.org/W2126275503,"Abstract The functional status of an integrin depends on the conformation of its extracellular domain, which is controlled by the cell expressing that receptor. The transmission of regulatory signals from within the cell is considered to be via propagated conformational changes from the receptor's cytoplasmic tails to the extracellular ligand binding “pocket.” The end result is increased accessibility of the ligand binding pocket in the high affinity (“active”) form of integrins. We report a novel monoclonal antibody (QE.2E5) that binds within the cysteine-rich repeats in the integrin β1 chain and induces high affinity binding of fibronectin to the integrin α5β1. The QE.2E5 epitope is located approximately 200 residues both from the predicted binding site for fibronectin and from the epitopes recognized by other activating anti-β1 monoclonal antibodies. It is also expressed on β1 integrins from a number of nonhuman species. Although they have the same functional effects, the binding of QE.2E5 and another activating antibody (8A2) to the receptor have contrasting effects on the expression of an activation-dependent epitope in the β1 chain. We propose that the cysteine-rich repeats contain a regulatory region that is distinct from those previously described in the integrin β1 chain."

This material is most clearly demonstrated when samples are subjected to gel filtration under conditions where GroEL is monomeric. There is a time-dependent increase in the high molecular weight material that occurs on incubation with ADP or, more slowly, with ATP. This material is generated during incubation, and none is present in the initial samples. Experiments with nucleases, proteases, radiolabeled nucleotides, and chemical cleavage reagents demonstrate that the high molecular weight material is polyadenylic acid whose formation is inhibited by phosphate.

The Escherichia coli chaperonin GroEL has been studied mostly for its ability to assist protein folding by binding and stabilizing non-native folding intermediates. This activity, together with the observation that GroEL is essential for E. coli, has been the focus of suggestions as to the role of this protein in the cell. However, the generality of the requirement for GroEL in the folding of most proteins has been called into question, since it has been calculated that there is only enough GroEL to refold ~5% of the proteins in E. coli (1Lorimer G.H. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 5-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). At the same time, several investigators have proposed additional roles for this chaperonin including involvement in protein turnover (2Kandror O. Busconi L. Sherman M. Goldberg A.L. J. Biol.

Chem. 1994; 269: 23575-23582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) did not contain GroEL. Other studies have indicated that GroEL can co-purify and functionally interact with RNase E activity (3Sohlberg B. Lundberg U. Hartl F.U. von Gabain A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 277-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), and it has been recently demonstrated that a protein complex containing GroEL can be isolated that binds and protects mRNA (4Georgellis D. Sohlberg B. Hartl F.U. von Gabain A. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 1259-1268Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). These latter studies did not report the presence of PNPase activity. polynucleotide phosphorylase high performance liquid chromatography polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. GroEL, as commonly isolated, copurifies with other polypeptide chains. These have most often been ascribed to the diverse set of polypeptides that interact with GroEL as it exerts its folding function. Recent methods have been developed to produce GroEL that appears quite homogeneous by gel staining, although the preparations often contain distinct tryptophan-like fluorescence, which is unexpected since GroEL contains no tryptophan in its sequence. Very recently it has been possible to treat GroEL in a way that removes this tryptophan fluorescence while retaining a fully functional chaperonin with respect to protein folding (7Ybarra J. Horowitz P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22962-22967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Since GroEL is large (Mr = 840,000), and it binds modestly sized proteins with a small stoichiometry (1:1), it is difficult to detect single proteins bound to GroEL oligomers. For example, 10 μg of GroEL would contain 0.4 μg of rhodanese (Mr = 33,000) at full occupancy, so that it might be difficult to detect bound rhodanese in partially occupied GroEL after its isolation. These considerations raise the possibility that GroEL may be a constituent of complexes in which advantage can be taken of its ability to provide extensive binding surfaces that could serve to organize activities and modify or sequester bound polypeptides or nucleotides. Therefore, it is of interest to determine whether distinct activities can be detected in association with GroEL. In this work, we report that polynucleotide phosphorylase activity can be found in association with highly purified GroEL, and that the presence of this protein can contribute to the commonly observed tryptophan-like fluorescence of these preparations. The partial occupancy after purification and the poor detectability by commonly applied procedures has complicated the detection in the usual preparations. The sensitivity of GroEL interactions to the solution conditions used in different isolation procedures can contribute to the variability of finding PNPase in each case. The present work also has a practical caveat, in that detection of radiolabeled nucleotide coeluting with GroEL does not necessarily imply protein binding since GroEL and polynucleotide products coelute in some of the commonly used chromatographic systems. Proteinase K (catalog number P6556) and polyribonucleotide:orthophosphate nucleotidyltransferase (PNPase; polynucleotide phosphorylase, EC2.7.7.8, catalog number P6264) were from Sigma. DNase I from bovine pancreas was from Boehringer Mannheim. Ribonuclease A (DNase-free) was prepared from Sigma RNase type IA and kindly supplied by Dr. John Lee (University of Texas Health Science Center, San Antonio, TX). All other reagents were analytical grade. The chaperonin GroEL was purified from lysates of E. coli cells bearing the multicopy plasmid pGroESL (8Goloubinoff P. Gatenby A.A. Lorimer G.H. Nature. 1989; 337: 44-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). This conventional preparation was a modified version of published protocols (9Hendrix R.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1979; 129: 375-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 10Chandrasekhar G.N. Tilly K. Woolford C. Hendrix R. Georgopoulos C. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 12414-12419Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as described previously (8Goloubinoff P. Gatenby A.A. Lorimer G.H. Nature. 1989; 337: 44-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar, 7Ybarra J. Horowitz P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22962-22967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The protein from this preparation was used for most of the work reported here. Conventionally purified GroEL was treated with Affi-Gel Blue (Bio-Rad) as described previously (11Fisher M.T. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 3955-3963Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 12Dessauer C, W. Bartlett S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19766-19776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to remove some 280 absorbing impurities. Briefly, 160 mg of GroEL were loaded onto an Affi-Gel Blue column (1.5 x 16.5 cm) that had been equilibrated with 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, that contained 50 mM KCl. After a brief period, the column was eluted with the equilibration buffer. GroEL eluted while the impurities were retained on the column. As reported previously (11Fisher M.T. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 3955-3963Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), GroEL prepared by this treatment contained a considerably reduced but still significant tryptophan-like fluorescence. GroEL was prepared as described previously by a method (Method I of 7Ybarra J. Horowitz P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22962-22967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) that involves disassembly of the GroEL 14-subunit oligomer and subsequent reassembly of the monomers (7Ybarra J. Horowitz P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22962-22967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). This procedure produces GroEL that contains very few contaminating polypeptides and shows little detectable tryptophan-like fluorescence. The GroEL so prepared is fully functional in its ability to assist the refolding of the enzyme rhodanese (7Ybarra J. Horowitz P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22962-22967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). HPLC gel permeation chromatography used a 7.5 mm x 30 cm TSKG4000SW column (TosoHaas) and was monitored at 230 nm. Chromatograms were typically developed at 1 ml/min. Sephacryl S400 gel permeation chromatography was performed using a 2.5 x 100 cm column in a conventional low pressure configuration. Nondenaturing gel electrophoresis was performed by the method of Neuhoff et al. (13Neuhoff V. Cheong-Kim K.S. Altland K. Electrophoresis. 1986; 7: 56-57Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar) using 6% polyacrylamide gels at constant 200 V for a 1-mm-thick gel. Denaturing gel electrophoresis was preformed using 12% polyacrylamide by the method of Laemmli (14Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207159) Google Scholar). Gels were stained for protein either with 0.05% Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250, 25% isopropyl alcohol, and 10% acetic acid, or they were silver-stained using Bio-Rad silver stain as described by the manufacturer. Where indicated, polynucleotide phosphorylase activity was probed on nondenaturing gels by incubating the gels overnight at 4°C in a solution of 50 mM TrisCl, pH 8.8, that contained 1 mM ADP and 2.5 mM MgCl2. After this, gels were stained using acridine orange by a modification of a procedure reported to detect polynucleotides (15Thang M.N. Thang D.C. Grunberg-Manago M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1967; 28: 374-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 16Py B. Causton H. Mudd E.A. Higgins C.F. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 14: 717-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Briefly, gels were incubated overnight at 4°C in 0.01% acridine orange, 0.1% lanthanum chloride, and 15% acetic acid. Gels were then washed in 7.5% acetic acid, after which polynucleotide containing regions were observed as reddish bands on an orange background. Fluorescence spectra were determined with an SLM 500C fluorometer (SLM Instruments, Urbana, IL). UV spectra were determined with a Milton Roy Spectronic 3000 diode array spectrophotometer (Houston, TX). High molecular weight material forms upon incubation of conventionally purified GroEL in ADP. A recently described protocol for purification of GroEL involves disassembly of the 14-mer in the presence of ADP (7Ybarra J. Horowitz P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22962-22967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The monomeric GroEL showed anomalous behavior when subjected to gel permeation chromatography, and the present studies were performed to document and determine the cause of these anomalies. Fig. 1 shows HPLC gel permeation chromatography of conventionally purified GroEL run on a TSK 4000 column after denaturation in 8 M urea and subsequent renaturation with MgADP for increasing times. There is a time-dependent increase in material absorbing at the 230 nm wavelength used for detection that elutes in the void volume (peak a, Fig. 1). This peak is well separated from the monomeric GroEL (peak b, Fig. 1). The curves represent chromatography of 300-μg samples injected at different times after dilution from 8 M urea (1-h incubation) into 50 mM triethanolamine acetate, pH 7.5, containing 5 mM MgADP to give a final urea concentration of 0.8 M. Incubations were at room temperature. Under these conditions, the GroEL remains largely monomeric. The monomers elute at b. The peak at a increases with time, and the profiles shown at a correspond, from the bottom, to: 0, 1, 2, and 3 h after dilution, respectively. GroEL 14-mer corresponds to the small shoulder between a and b. The material collected under peak a had a UV maximum at 260 nm characteristic of nucleotides. The appearance of peak a required nucleotide and, although it could be observed on incubation with ATP, the peak appeared more slowly than when the incubation was with ADP. In addition, the appearance of peak a with ATP was associated with hydrolysis. Thus, an experiment was performed in which GroEL (400 μl at 1 mg/ml) was incubated with 58 x 106 cpm of γ-labeled ATP, and 120 μl of the mixture was chromatographed on the TSK column. No counts were recovered under peak a for incubations of 0, 2, or 4 h. All counts were in the included volume. When the same experiment was repeated with α-labeled ATP using 36 x 106 cpm, 112,000 cpm were recovered under peak a. These results demonstrated that nucleotide-like material was contained in peak a and raised the question of its origin. It is important to realize that these gel filtration experiments would not clearly separate 14-mers from the material under peak a, and, thus, previous experiments of this type that detected some nucleotide under the GroEL peak may not have been monitoring nucleotide bound to the GroEL. In fact, a previous report indicated that some preparations of GroEL could generate high molecular weight nucleotide-like material (17Todd M.J. Viitanen P.V. Lorimer G.H. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 8560-8567Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Further experiments were done here to determine the nature and origin of the material that is under a. The main question was whether the material was released from GroEL by the treatment or whether it was being formed during incubation. If it was being formed, was it by GroEL itself or from some copurified activity residing on a distinct protein? Fig. 2 shows nondenaturing gels of samples from the gel filtration fractions in Fig. 1 run under conditions that can resolve GroEL monomers and 14-mers. At t = 0 there are monomers and some 14-mers, but there is no material in the lanes corresponding to fractions from peak a (first four fractions at t = 0). The gel on the right shows that after 5 h there is material under peak a that stains with silver, but barely enters the gel. These latter bands do not stain with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. This can be seen more clearly in Fig. 3 which shows some of these fractions run on SDS gels and stained with silver (left) or Coomassie (right). The material from the GroEL monomer peak stains with both Coomassie and silver, while the material under peak a stains only with silver (labeled 260). This reflects either the amount or nature of the material under peak a. Nucleotides stain with silver, but stain poorly with Coomassie.Fig. 3SDS-PAGE of samples from an elution profile as inFig. 1. The three lanes on the left are Coomassie-stained and represent samples from region a in lanes 1 and 2 (labeled 260) and from region b in lane 3. The rightmost three lanes show the same samples stained with silver. The GroEL was denatured as for Fig. 1 and incubated with MgADP for 5 h before chromatography. The single Coomassie staining band in lane 3 migrated at the same position as untreated GroEL.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Advantage was taken of the fact that the material from peak a in Fig. 1 could be silver-stained to test its sensitivity to several treatments. No band could be observed after treating for 30 min a sample of this material containing 0.35 A260 (from a stock solution containing 35.2 A260/ml) with 0.5 M KOH or 0.1 mg/ml RNase. The band could still be observed after treatment with DNase (0.1 mg/ml) or proteinase K (0.1 mg/ml). Thus, the material in peak a has the characteristics of an RNA-type polymer. In separate experiments, fractions from gel chromatography of GroEL not treated with ADP were subjected to electrophoresis. Fig. 4 shows denaturing (upper) and native (lower) gels for samples taken from the peak fractions of a sample of conventionally purified GroEL chromatographed on Sephacryl S400 without treatment with ADP. The SDS gel shows that fractions across the peak appear homogeneous by Coomassie staining. In addition, the lanes denoted by A contain samples of conventionally purified GroEL that were treated with Affi-Gel Blue as described under “Experimental Procedures” in a procedure that reduces the level of tryptophan fluorescence associated with the GroEL. The lanes marked P contain samples of E. coli PNPase (Sigma). The lower, nondenaturing gels show samples from the same fractions as above that were electrophoresed in the absence of any preincubation with ADP. If these gels were directly stained with Coomassie, only the upper bands would be disclosed (data not shown). Instead, the gels were incubated overnight in MgADP at 4°C before being treated with acridine orange to detect polynucleotide products. Only the lower bands were observed as reddish bands on an orange background. These bands coelectrophoresed with the acridine orange bands that were observed with authentic PNPase. This postelectrophoretic staining detected proteins in the lower bands by virtue of their ability to produce polynucleotides in the gel. Samples of GroEL that were treated with Affi-Gel Blue showed substantially reduced quantities of the acridine orange band (lane A, gel 3). After staining with acridine orange, the gels were counterstained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue which after this total protocol showed both the upper and lower bands as demonstrated in Fig. 4 (gels 3 and 4). These results indicate that proteins that remained associated with GroEL throughout the purification procedure could be separated by this electrophoretic protocol. Fluorescence spectra were used to test whether proteins could be observed under peak a. Fluorescence spectra were measured with excitation at 280 or 295 nm for a sample of pooled fractions from peak a after TSK 4000 chromatography. These spectra were characteristic of tryptophan-containing proteins, and, in each case, the wavelength maximum was at 346 nm. Samples of GroEL that were prepared by the assembly-disassembly protocol were subjected to the same treatments as described above. No evidence of a polynucleotide product was observed under any conditions, and the fluorescence spectrum was that of a protein containing only tyrosine as previously reported (7Ybarra J. Horowitz P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22962-22967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Those peptides that have been found associated with GroEL after purification have always been considered to be contaminating peptides that reflect the binding of a large and diverse group of polypeptides in various states of synthesis and folding. The only reported activity that has been associated with purified GroEL is RNase E. The results presented here demonstrate that polynucleotide phosphorylase activity can be detected in samples of highly purified GroEL that has been prepared under conditions that should be capable of separating these proteins. The results suggest that there are conditions that can result in the association of these proteins. These types of experiments cannot determine whether this association is an in vivo state of these proteins as opposed to a fortuitous interaction consequent to their adventitious admixture during preparation. It is interesting, though, that separate studies have demonstrated on the one hand that RNase E and PNPase are associated, while on the other hand RNase E and GroEL can be associated. It is tempting to speculate that these three proteins can be associated at some stage of their in vivo existence. This would support the role of GroEL as a participant in the processing and turnover of mRNA (3Sohlberg B. Lundberg U. Hartl F.U. von Gabain A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 277-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The polynucleotide phosphorylase is difficult to detect in the presence of GroEL. It stains poorly with common protein stains, and it would be a minor component if present with the much larger GroEL. Conventionally purified GroEL is commonly reported to contain the equivalent of 0.2 mol of tryptophan/monomer based on fluorescence. Based on the molecular weight of 77,122 and the content of 2 Trp per PNPase polypeptide, the observed Trp content would correspond to a complex containing 13% PNPase by weight. The polynucleotide product can be formed by ATP as well as ADP, although more slowly. It is expected that PNPase activity is specific for ADP. Presumably, the slow ATPase activity of GroEL can form ADP which then can be polymerized by the PNPase. On a practical note, the finding of PNPase activity with commonly available GroEL represents a caveat for assessing the binding of nucleotides by gel permeation methods that separate the large GroEL from the smaller mononucleotides. On many commonly used columns, the polynucleotide products will coelute with the GroEL oligomer, thus leading to the inference that the nucleotide has become incorporated into the GroEL. Overall, GroEL may be involved in a wide range of functions that can take advantage of its ability to bind partially folded polypeptides and perhaps polynucleotides and folded proteins with appropriate structures such as surface loops or interactive surfaces."
