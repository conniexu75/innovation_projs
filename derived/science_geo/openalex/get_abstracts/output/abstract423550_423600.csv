https://openalex.org/W2094608047,"Human populations have experienced recent explosive growth, expanding by at least three orders of magnitude over the past 400 generations. This departure from equilibrium skews patterns of genetic variation and distorts basic principles of population genetics. We characterized the empirical signatures of explosive growth on the site frequency spectrum and found that the discrepancy in rare variant abundance across demographic modeling studies is mostly due to differences in sample size. Rapid recent growth increases the load of rare variants and is likely to play a role in the individual genetic burden of complex disease risk. Hence, the extreme recent human population growth needs to be taken into consideration in studying the genetics of complex diseases and traits."

Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP-1) (ADP, adenosine diphosphate) synthesizes poly(ADP-ribose), which is attached to and regulates proteins involved in DNA repair. Langelier et al. (p. 728 ; see the Perspective by Gagné et al. ) use x-ray crystallography and biochemical analysis to demonstrate how PARP-1 detects DNA damage and how the interaction with DNA is coupled to poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation activity."
https://openalex.org/W2116053761,"To improve cancer therapy, it is critical to target metastasizing cells. Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) are rare cells found in the blood of patients with solid tumors and may play a key role in cancer dissemination. Uncovering CTC phenotypes offers a potential avenue to inform treatment. However, CTC transcriptional profiling is limited by leukocyte contamination; an approach to surmount this problem is single cell analysis. Here we demonstrate feasibility of performing high dimensional single CTC profiling, providing early insight into CTC heterogeneity and allowing comparisons to breast cancer cell lines widely used for drug discovery.We purified CTCs using the MagSweeper, an immunomagnetic enrichment device that isolates live tumor cells from unfractionated blood. CTCs that met stringent criteria for further analysis were obtained from 70% (14/20) of primary and 70% (21/30) of metastatic breast cancer patients; none were captured from patients with non-epithelial cancer (n = 20) or healthy subjects (n = 25). Microfluidic-based single cell transcriptional profiling of 87 cancer-associated and reference genes showed heterogeneity among individual CTCs, separating them into two major subgroups, based on 31 highly expressed genes. In contrast, single cells from seven breast cancer cell lines were tightly clustered together by sample ID and ER status. CTC profiles were distinct from those of cancer cell lines, questioning the suitability of such lines for drug discovery efforts for late stage cancer therapy.For the first time, we directly measured high dimensional gene expression in individual CTCs without the common practice of pooling such cells. Elevated transcript levels of genes associated with metastasis NPTN, S100A4, S100A9, and with epithelial mesenchymal transition: VIM, TGFß1, ZEB2, FOXC1, CXCR4, were striking compared to cell lines. Our findings demonstrate that profiling CTCs on a cell-by-cell basis is possible and may facilitate the application of 'liquid biopsies' to better model drug discovery."

https://openalex.org/W2048087821,"Aggregation of biotherapeutics has the potential to induce an immunogenic response. Here, we show that aggregated therapeutic antibodies, previously generated and determined to contain a variety of attributes (Joubert, M. K., Luo, Q., Nashed-Samuel, Y., Wypych, J., and Narhi, L. O. (2011) J. Biol. Chem. 286, 25118-25133), can enhance the in vitro innate immune response of a population of naive human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. This response depended on the aggregate type, inherent immunogenicity of the monomer, and donor responsiveness, and required a high number of particles, well above that detected in marketed drug products, at least in this in vitro system. We propose a cytokine signature as a potential biomarker of the in vitro peripheral blood mononuclear cell response to aggregates. The cytokines include IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10, MCP-1, MIP-1α, MIP-1β, MMP-2, and TNF-α. IL-6 and IL-10 might have an immunosuppressive effect on the long term immune response. Aggregates made by stirring induced the highest response compared with aggregates made by other methods. Particle size in the 2-10 μm range and the retention of some folded structure were associated with an increased response. The mechanism of aggregate activation at the innate phase was found to occur through specific cell surface receptors (the toll-like receptors TLR-2 and TLR-4, FcγRs, and the complement system). The innate signal was shown to progress to an adaptive T-cell response characterized by T-cell proliferation and secretion of T-cell cytokines. Investigating the ability of aggregates to induce cytokine signatures as biomarkers of immune responses is essential for determining their risk of immunogenicity."

https://openalex.org/W1993380981,"Earthquake Model Shakedown The Parkfield segment of the San Andreas Fault in California experiences Magnitude 6.0 earthquakes at a surprisingly regular interval—roughly every 22 years. This area is one of the most well studied fault segments in the world, yet computational models often struggle to integrate the wealth of observational data with theoretical predictions. Barbot et al. (p. 707 ; see the Perspective by Segall ) constructed a dynamic model of a fault segment which, when integrated with previous observations, reproduces the behavior of the Parkfield segment over the entire earthquake cycle. Because the model is based on realistic fault physics, it not only explains the distribution of small earthquakes but also the recurrence interval of large earthquakes and the amount of geodetic strain accumulated postseismically. It also reveals how smaller earthquakes can influence this region's semiregular earthquake cycle."

https://openalex.org/W1996742616,"The recent discovery that peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) targeted anti-diabetic drugs function by inhibiting Cdk5-mediated phosphorylation of the receptor has provided a new viewpoint to evaluate and perhaps develop improved insulin-sensitizing agents. Herein we report the development of a novel thiazolidinedione that retains similar anti-diabetic efficacy as rosiglitazone in mice yet does not elicit weight gain or edema, common side effects associated with full PPARγ activation. Further characterization of this compound shows GQ-16 to be an effective inhibitor of Cdk5-mediated phosphorylation of PPARγ. The structure of GQ-16 bound to PPARγ demonstrates that the compound utilizes a binding mode distinct from other reported PPARγ ligands, although it does share some structural features with other partial agonists, such as MRL-24 and PA-082, that have similarly been reported to dissociate insulin sensitization from weight gain. Hydrogen/deuterium exchange studies reveal that GQ-16 strongly stabilizes the β-sheet region of the receptor, presumably explaining the compound's efficacy in inhibiting Cdk5-mediated phosphorylation of Ser-273. Molecular dynamics simulations suggest that the partial agonist activity of GQ-16 results from the compound's weak ability to stabilize helix 12 in its active conformation. Our results suggest that the emerging model, whereby “ideal” PPARγ-based therapeutics stabilize the β-sheet/Ser-273 region and inhibit Cdk5-mediated phosphorylation while minimally invoking adipogenesis and classical agonism, is indeed a valid framework to develop improved PPARγ modulators that retain antidiabetic actions while minimizing untoward effects.

The classical mechanism by which TZDs activate PPARγ is well established (7Nolte R.T. Wisely G.B. Westin S. Cobb J.E. Lambert M.H. Kurokawa R. Rosenfeld M.G. Willson T.M. Glass C.K. Milburn M.V.

Ligand binding induces a large conformational change in helix 12 of the ligand-binding domain (LBD) of the receptor (8Nagy L. Schwabe J.W. Mechanism of the nuclear receptor molecular switch.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; 29: 317-324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). This remodeling of the LBD creates a hydrophobic cleft on the surface of the receptor that serves as a high affinity docking site for the recruitment of transcriptional coactivators. Although the mechanism of transcriptional activation may be well appreciated, the rationale for insulin sensitization has not been. First, why is the activation of a pro-obesogenic receptor beneficial in treating insulin resistance, a phenomenon closely linked to obesity? Further, significant efforts toward the development of PPARγ ligands have failed to demonstrate a clear correlation between receptor transcriptional activation and in vivo efficacy. In fact, one of the most tantalizing results of these efforts may have been the discovery of “partial agonists,” ligands with only partial efficacy in activating PPARγ that maintain insulin-sensitizing actions. That many partial agonists were reported to have lesser side effects than the full agonist TZDs suggested that ligands could be developed that maintain the insulin sensitization of TZDs without the undesirable side effects; however, the rationale for doing so was unclear. Recently, however, studies from Choi et al. (9Choi J.H. Banks A.S. Estall J.L. Kajimura S. Boström P. Laznik D. Ruas J.L. Chalmers M.J. Kamenecka T.M. Blüher M. Griffin P.R. Spiegelman B.M. Anti-diabetic drugs inhibit obesity-linked phosphorylation of PPARγ by Cdk5.Nature. 2010; 466: 451-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar) have shown that PPARγ phosphorylation at Ser-273 is linked to obesity and insulin resistance. Ser-273 phosphorylation results in the dysregulation of a subset of PPARγ target genes, such as adiponectin, that are known to be associated with insulin sensitization. Moreover, this study also suggested that both TZDs and partial agonists with anti-diabetic effects improve insulin sensitivity primarily by inhibiting Cdk5-mediated phosphorylation of PPARγ at Ser-273. Ser-273 phosphorylation seems to be distinct from classical transcriptional activation, which appears to mediate at least some of the undesirable side effects of chronic PPARγ activation. Herein we report the development of a novel PPARγ-targeted ligand that displays robust anti-diabetic activity in mice yet is dissociated from the TZD-related side effects of weight gain and edema. Structural and biochemical analyses allowed us to relate ligand binding mode to the desirable pharmacology and suggest that the in vivo efficacy of this compound arises from its ability to selectively and strongly stabilize the β-sheet region of the receptor, thus inhibiting Ser-273 phosphorylation by the Cdk5 kinase, as originally proposed by Choi et al. (9Choi J.H. Banks A.S. Estall J.L. Kajimura S. Boström P. Laznik D. Ruas J.L. Chalmers M.J. Kamenecka T.M. Blüher M. Griffin P.R. Spiegelman B.M.

Anti-aP2, anti-GAPDH, HRP-conjugated anti-mouse, and anti-goat IgGs were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). [3H]rosiglitazone was from American Radiolabeled Chemicals (St. Louis, MO). Human promonocyte U-937 cells were transiently cotransfected with a plasmid containing the PPARγ LBD fused to the Gal4 DNA-binding domain and a plasmid containing the luciferase reporter gene under regulation by five Gal4 DNA-binding elements (UASG × 5 TK-luciferase). Transfections were performed by electroporation, and cells were treated with vehicle (DMSO) or compounds for 24 h at 37 °C. A reporter luciferase assay kit (Promega) was used to measure luciferase activity according to the manufacturer's instructions, with a luminometer (Turner). Each experiment was performed in triplicate and repeated at least three times. Results were reported as -fold induction of normalized luciferase activity ± S.E. His-LBD-hPPARγ was incubated for 12 h at 4 °C with 40 nm [3H]rosiglitazone (specific activity 50 Ci/mmol) in buffer containing 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 50 mm KCl, and 10 mm dithiothreitol, in a final volume of 100 μl. Vehicle or unlabeled ligands were then added and allowed to incubate for an additional 12 h at 4 °C. Bound radioactive ligand was separated from free radioactivity by gravity flow-through 1-ml Sephadex G-25 desalting columns and quantitated using a liquid scintillation counter. Ki values were calculated using the one-site competition model in GraphPad 4.0 software (GraphPad, San Diego, CA). Similar methods were used initially to determine the Kd value of [3H]rosiglitazone to be 33 nm. Full-length PPARγ was labeled with [35S]methionine using a coupled in vitro transcription/translation system (Promega). GST and GST-SRC1(381–882) were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 cells and purified using glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads. The interaction reaction was carried out as follows. Three ml of [35S]methionine-labeled PPARγ were incubated with the glutathione bead suspension containing 4 mg of GST or GST-SRC1 fusion protein in GST-binding buffer (1× TST buffer with 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mm DTT, and 2 g/ml bovine serum albumin) in the presence of vehicle or the indicated ligands in a final volume of 150 ml. After 2 h on a nutator at 4 °C, the beads were washed three times with 1 ml of GST-binding buffer. Bound proteins were eluted in 2× SDS loading buffer and resolved in 10% SDS-PAGE. After electrophoresis, the gels were fixed in 10% acetic acid (v/v), 40% methanol (v/v) for 30 min; treated in Amplify (Amersham Biosciences) for 30 min; and dried under vacuum for 2 h at 80 °C. Labeled PPARγ was then visualized by autoradiography. Murine mesenchymal C3H10T1/2 cells or mouse embryonic fibroblast NIH-3T3L1 cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 g/ml streptomycin and maintained at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Two-day postconfluent cells (day 0) were induced to differentiate by incubation with DMEM supplemented with 1 μg/ml insulin (Sigma), 0.5 mm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (Sigma), and 1 μm dexamethasone (Sigma) for 2 days, followed by incubation with medium supplemented with 1 μg/ml insulin for 2 days. After this, cells were maintained in cell culture medium, changed every second day, until processing for analysis. Vehicle, 10 mm rosiglitazone, or 10 mm GQ-16 was added to the medium throughout the differentiation period (from day 0 to 2). Adipogenesis was assessed by staining intracellular lipids with Oil Red O, as described (11Janderová L. McNeil M. Murrell A.N. Mynatt R.L. Smith S.R.

Twelve-week-old mice that had been fed a high fat diet consisting of 55% calories from fat, 29% from carbohydrate, and 16% from protein (produced by the University of Campinas Central Animal Breeding Center; supplemental Table 1) since the age of 4 weeks were randomly assigned to receive vehicle, rosiglitazone (4 mg/kg/day), or GQ-16 (20 mg/kg/day) by oral gavage daily (n = 6/group). After 10 or 12 days of treatment, mice were submitted to either an insulin tolerance test (ITT) or intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test, respectively. All mice were weighed at 12 days. For the ITT, 1.5 IU/kg of human recombinant insulin (Humulin R) from Lilly was injected intraperitoneally, and serum glucose was measured at 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 min thereafter. Glucose disappearance rate (Kitt) was calculated as described previously (12Bonora E. Moghetti P. Zancanaro C. Cigolini M. Querena M. Cacciatori V. Corgnati A. Muggeo M.

Metab. 1989; 68: 374-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). For the intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test, glucose was administered intraperitoneally at a dose of 1 g/kg body weight, and serum glucose was measured at 0, 15, 30, 60, 90, and 120 min. After 15 days, mice were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of sodium thiopental, and anesthesia was confirmed by the loss of pedal and corneal reflexes. Insulin was then injected (3.8 IU/kg intravenously), and 5 min later, muscle, adipose tissue, and liver extracts were used for immunoblotting with the following antibodies: anti-insulin receptor, anti-phosphorylated insulin receptor, anti-insulin receptor substrate 1, anti-phosphorylated insulin receptor substrate 1, anti-JNK (Santa Cruz), anti-protein kinase B, anti-phosphorylated protein kinase B, and anti-IκBα (Cell Signaling). Male C57Bl/6J mice at 6 weeks of age were fed a Western diet (45% kcal fat, D12079, Research Diets) for 10 weeks. Metabolic rate, food intake, and ambulatory activity were measured using the comprehensive laboratory animal monitoring system from Columbus Instruments (Columbus, OH). Mice were housed in individual metabolic cages with food and water ad libitum and allowed to acclimate for 48 h prior to the start of data collection. Mice were administered vehicle, rosiglitazone (4 mg/kg/day), or GQ-16 (20 mg/kg/day) via intraperitoneal injection. Energy expenditure, food intake and ambulatory activity were examined and reported as an average over 3 days. After 7 days, fat and lean body mass were measured by quantitative NMR, and hematocrit levels were measured following capillary centrifugation. Purified PPARγ LBD was bound to HisTrap magnetic beads (Invitrogen) and incubated with active Cdk5 p35 (Sigma) in 70 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm DTT, and 1 μm ATP for 1 h, after which the beads were washed three times with wash buffer, containing 20 mm Tris, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Triton X-100. Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and PPARγ phosphorylation was assessed by autoradiography. The N-terminal His6-tagged PPARγ LBD construct was transformed into BL21 cells grown in LB at 37 °C to an OD of 0.6. Expression was induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and cells were grown at 18 °C overnight. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, lysed via sonication, and purified using a GE Hiprep Ni2+-NTA affinity column via the manufacturer's standard protocol and eluted with 500 mm imidazole. The fraction containing pure PPARγ LBD was buffer-exchanged into 25 mm Tris buffer at pH 7.5 containing 150 mm NaCl using a desalting column. The protein·drug complex was prepared by adding a saturated solution of GQ-16 in DMSO to a 1:2 PPARγ-LBD/SRC1-peptide (LTERHKIL-HRLLQEGSPS) solution. After mixing, the final concentration of GQ-16 was ∼600 mm. The complex was incubated at room temperature overnight and then concentrated to a final protein concentration of 10 mg/ml. The protein·ligand complex was crystallized at room temperature using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method by mixing equal volumes of the above complex and the reservoir solution containing 0.2 m ammonium acetate, 0.1 m sodium citrate at pH 5.6, and 30% PEG 4000. X-ray data were collected at the Advanced Light Source (ALS) Beamline 5.0.1. Data processing and scaling was done using IMOSFLM and SCALA module in CCP4 (13Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4 The CCP4 suite. Programs for protein crystallography.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19762) Google Scholar), and the structure was refined via the PHASER molecular replacement (14McCoy A.J. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Adams P.D.

Selected intensity data and refinement statistics are given in supplemental Table 2. All figures were prepared using PyMOL software (Schrödinger LLC, New York). Mass spectroscopy experiments were conducted using apo-hPPARγ LBD and hPPARγ LBD in the presence of rosiglitazone and GQ-16 (1.5-fold molar excess of ligand). Hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectrometry experiments were initiated by 20-fold dilution of hPPARγ in D2O buffer (final buffer: 1 mm Hepes, 7.5 mm NaCl, 0.2% glycerol, 0.1 mm DTT, and 60% (v/v) D2O) at 25 °C. These mixtures were incubated for 0, 1, 5, 30, and 90 min. Hydrogen/deuterium exchange was halted at each time point by placing samples on ice and adding 10 mm phosphate buffer (pH 2.5). The protein was immediately submitted to cleavage with pepsin (10 μg) for 7 min at 4 °C to decrease the rate of solvent back-exchange. After the addition of 30% acetonitrile, the samples were immediately applied onto a Synapt G2 HDMS (Waters) by direct infusion. The software MS-Digest (17Clauser K.R. Baker P. Burlingame A.L. Role of accurate mass measurement (±10 ppm) in protein identification strategies employing MS or MS/MS and database searching.Anal. Chem. 1999; 71: 2871-2882Crossref PubMed Scopus (981) Google Scholar) was used to identify the sequence of the peptic peptide ions, generated by pepsin cleavage. Deuterium level for each peptide was determined from the differences in centroid masses between the deuterated and non-deuterated fragments (18Figueira A.C. Saidemberg D.M. Souza P.C. Martínez L.

This procedure was applied to both liganded and unliganded protein. The simulations started from the crystallographic structure presented in this work (chain B of the GQ-16 complex) and from the structure 1FM6 (19Gampe Jr., R.T. Montana V.G. Lambert M.H. Miller A.B.

Missing residues in the GQ-16 complex structure (206–209 and 258–276) were taken from the structure of the rosiglitazone complex, which fit well after structural alignment with LovoAlign (20Martínez L. Andreani R. Martínez J.M. Convergent algorithms for protein structural alignment.BMC Bioinformatics. 2007; 8: 306Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Hydrogen atoms were added, and the protonation states of the histidine residues were estimated with H++ (21Gordon J.C. Myers J.B. Folta T. Shoja V. Heath L.S. Onufriev A. H++.

For all of the neutral histidines, the position of the hydrogen atoms was defined in such a way as to favor hydrogen bonds. The systems were then fully solvated with a water shell of at least 15 Å and neutralized with sodium and chloride ions to a total concentration of 0.15 mol/liter using the vmd (22Humphrey W. Dalke A. Schulten K. VMD: visual molecular dynamics.J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14 (27–28): 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (38802) Google Scholar) plugins solvate and autoionize, respectively. The final systems contained around 58,000 atoms. The CHARMM force field (23MacKerell A.D. Bashford D. Bellott Dunbrack R.L. Evanseck J.D. Field M.J. Fischer S. Gao J. Guo H. Ha S. Joseph-McCarthy D.

Comparison of simple potential functions for simulating liquid water.J. Chem. Phys. 1983; 79: 926-935Crossref Scopus (30080) Google Scholar) model was used for water molecules. Force field parameters for rosiglitazone were obtained as described previously (25Hansson A. Souza P.C.T. Silveira R.L. Martínez L. Skaf M.S. CHARMM force field parametrization of rosiglitazone.Int. J. Quantum Chem. 2011; 111: 1346-1354Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar), and GQ-16 was parameterized consistent with this protocol. The simulations were performed using periodic boundary conditions in the NpT ensemble 300 K and 1 atm using the Langevin thermostat and the Langevin/Nosé-Hoover piston for the temperature and pressure control, respectively. Electrostatics was evaluated using the particle mesh Ewald (26Leach A. Molecular Modeling: Principles and Applications. 2nd Ed. Prentice Hall, Harlow, UK2001Google Scholar) algorithm, and short range interactions were truncated at a cut-off radius of 12 Å. All of the bonds involving apolar hydrogens were constrained at their equilibrium values using SHAKE (27Ryckaert J. Ciccotti G. Berendsen H. Numerical integration of the Cartesian equations of motion of a system with constraints. Molecular dynamics of n-alkanes.J. Comput. Phys. 1977; 23: 327-341Crossref Scopus (16982) Google Scholar), and a time step of 2.0 fs was used for the integration of the equations of motion. The following treatment was used to prepare the systems for the production runs: (a) 2000 energy minimization steps using the conjugate gradients algorithm (CG) followed by 200 ps of MD keeping the ligand and protein residues fixed, except modeled residues; (b) 1000 energy minimization steps using CG followed by 200 ps of MD keeping only α carbons fixed (except those modeled); (c) 600 ps of MD without any constraints. After these preparative steps, MD trajectories of 5.0 ns were generated for analysis. This protocol was repeated five times for each system using the program NAMD (28Phillips J.C. Braun R. Wang W. Gumbart J. Tajkhorshid E. Villa E. Chipot C. Skeel R.D. Kalé L. Schulten K. Scalable molecular dynamics with NAMD.J. Comput. Chem. 2005; 26: 1781-1802Crossref PubMed Scopus (13191) Google Scholar). Data handling, analysis, and graphical representations were performed using GraphPad 4.0 software (GraphPad, San Diego, CA). Statistical differences were determined by one-way analysis of variance followed by Student-Newman-Keuls multiple comparison or by Student's t test; p < 0.05 was accepted as statistically significant. We previously described a series of 5-benzylidene-4-(4-methyl-benzyl)-thiazolidine-2,4-dione derivatives substituted on the benzylidene moiety (29Mourão R.H. Silva T.G. Soares A.L. Vieira E.S.

Chem. 2005; 40: 1129-1133Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) that included the ligand GQ-2. As an extension of this effort we synthesized the related compound GQ-16 (Fig. 1). GQ-16 was found to be a moderate affinity ligand for the LBD of PPARγ, exhibiting a Ki of 160 nm (supplemental Fig. S1A). GQ-16 was specific for PPARγ and possessed no detectable activity when tested for the ability to activate other PPAR subtypes (PPARα or PPARβ/δ) or RXRα (supplemental Fig. S1B). In transactivation assays, GQ-16 acted as a weak partial agonist. Even high concentrations of GQ-16 elicited only approximately one-third of the maximal activation stimulated by rosiglitazone (Fig. 2A). In vitro binding studies performed in the presence of saturating concentrations of ligand demonstrated that GQ-16 is significantly less effective in promoting the interaction between PPARγ and SRC-1 than the TZD troglitazone (supplemental Fig. S2). Finally, GQ-16 displayed reduced adipogenic potential in both NIH-3T3 and C3H10T1/2 cells, established models of PPARγ-dependent adipogenesis. Intracellular lipid accumulation afforded by GQ-16 and induction of the adipocyte-specific marker aP2 was less than that obtained with rosiglitazone (Fig. 2, B and C). Collectively, these results suggest that the binding of GQ-16 to PPARγ induces a receptor conformation that is suboptimal for the recruitment of coactivators to the AF-2 surface of the receptor.FIGURE 2GQ-16 is a partial agonist of PPARγ with modest adipogenic activity.

https://openalex.org/W2028807913,"Sepsis and jaundice are common conditions in newborns that can lead to brain damage. Though lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is known to alter the integrity of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), little is known on the effects of unconjugated bilirubin (UCB) and even less on the joint effects of UCB and LPS on brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMEC).Monolayers of primary rat BMEC were treated with 1 µg/ml LPS and/or 50 µM UCB, in the presence of 100 µM human serum albumin, for 4 or 24 h. Co-cultures of BMEC with astroglial cells, a more complex BBB model, were used in selected experiments. LPS led to apoptosis and UCB induced both apoptotic and necrotic-like cell death. LPS and UCB led to inhibition of P-glycoprotein and activation of matrix metalloproteinases-2 and -9 in mono-cultures. Transmission electron microscopy evidenced apoptotic bodies, as well as damaged mitochondria and rough endoplasmic reticulum in BMEC by either insult. Shorter cell contacts and increased caveolae-like invaginations were noticeable in LPS-treated cells and loss of intercellular junctions was observed upon treatment with UCB. Both compounds triggered impairment of endothelial permeability and transendothelial electrical resistance both in mono- and co-cultures. The functional changes were confirmed by alterations in immunostaining for junctional proteins β-catenin, ZO-1 and claudin-5. Enlargement of intercellular spaces, and redistribution of junctional proteins were found in BMEC after exposure to LPS and UCB.LPS and/or UCB exert direct toxic effects on BMEC, with distinct temporal profiles and mechanisms of action. Therefore, the impairment of brain endothelial integrity upon exposure to these neurotoxins may favor their access to the brain, thus increasing the risk of injury and requiring adequate clinical management of sepsis and jaundice in the neonatal period."
https://openalex.org/W2025439383,"For ~40 years it has been widely accepted that (i) the exercise-induced increase in muscle fatty acid oxidation (FAO) is dependent on the increased delivery of circulating fatty acids, and (ii) exercise training-induced FAO up-regulation is largely attributable to muscle mitochondrial biogenesis. These long standing concepts were developed prior to the recent recognition that fatty acid entry into muscle occurs via a regulatable sarcolemmal CD36-mediated mechanism. We examined the role of CD36 in muscle fuel selection under basal conditions, during a metabolic challenge (exercise), and after exercise training. We also investigated whether CD36 overexpression, independent of mitochondrial changes, mimicked exercise training-induced FAO up-regulation. Under basal conditions CD36-KO versus WT mice displayed reduced fatty acid transport (-21%) and oxidation (-25%), intramuscular lipids (less than or equal to -31%), and hepatic glycogen (-20%); but muscle glycogen, VO(2max), and mitochondrial content and enzymes did not differ. In acutely exercised (78% VO(2max)) CD36-KO mice, fatty acid transport (-41%), oxidation (-37%), and exercise duration (-44%) were reduced, whereas muscle and hepatic glycogen depletions were accelerated by 27-55%, revealing 2-fold greater carbohydrate use. Exercise training increased mtDNA and β-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase similarly in WT and CD36-KO muscles, but FAO was increased only in WT muscle (+90%). Comparable CD36 increases, induced by exercise training (+44%) or by CD36 overexpression (+41%), increased FAO similarly (84-90%), either when mitochondrial biogenesis and FAO enzymes were up-regulated (exercise training) or when these were unaltered (CD36 overexpression). Thus, sarcolemmal CD36 has a key role in muscle fuel selection, exercise performance, and training-induced muscle FAO adaptation, challenging long held views of mechanisms involved in acute and adaptive regulation of muscle FAO."
https://openalex.org/W2066199154,"Homeostatic scaling allows neurons to alter synaptic transmission to compensate for changes in network activity. Here, we show that suppression of network activity with tetrodotoxin, which increases surface expression of AMPA receptors (AMPARs), dramatically reduces levels of the deSUMOylating (where SUMO is small ubiquitin-like modifier) enzyme SENP1, leading to a consequent increase in protein SUMOylation. Overexpression of the catalytic domain of SENP1 prevents this scaling effect, and we identify Arc as a SUMO substrate involved in the tetrodotoxin-induced increase in AMPAR surface expression. Thus, protein SUMOylation plays an important and previously unsuspected role in synaptic trafficking of AMPARs that underlies homeostatic scaling."

Both of these epigenetic marks act to restrict chromatin accessibility and inhibit gene transcription. These regions remain methylated in lineages that do not express the cytokine, but become demethylated in the cytokine-expressing lineages.

However, some gene regulatory regions show the opposite pattern, being hypomethylated in naïve T cells and becoming hypermethylated upon differentiation. For instance, CpG dinucleotides in the ifnγ promoter are largely unmethylated in naïve CD4+ T cells.

In mature T cells, DNMT3a is induced upon T cell receptor ligation (13Gamper C.J. Agoston A.T. Nelson W.G. Powell J.D. Identification of DNA methyltransferase 3a as a T cell receptor-induced regulator of Th1 and Th2 differentiation.J. Immunol. 2009; 183: 2267-2276Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) and is recruited to the ifnγ promoter concomitant with its de novo methylation in Th2 cells (14Jones B. Chen J. Inhibition of IFN-γ transcription by site-specific methylation during T helper cell development.EMBO J. 2006; 25: 2443-2452Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), but whether this process is required to silence off-lineage cytokine gene transcription and to limit lineage plasticity in non-Th1 cells such as Th17 or Treg is not known. We find that T cell-specific deletion of DNMT3a results in a complete failure of Th2, Th17, and iTreg lineage cells to de novo methylate DNA at the ifnγ promoter, which in turn results in a decreased capacity of these non-Th1 lineages to maintain the ifnγ gene in a silent state. Dysregulated de novo DNA methylation led to decreased levels of the silencing H3K27me3 mark, and increased levels of the transcriptionally permissive H3K4me3 mark upon restimulation in the presence of IL-12. These results establish a causal link between DNA methylation and histone H3K4 methylation at an endogenous locus, and demonstrate that established Th1, Th17, and iTreg use de novo DNA methylation to actively repress the production of IFNγ when subsequently faced with a Th1 environment. DNMT3a2loxP mice on a B6/129 background were provided generously by Dr. En Li (Novartis). These mice were intercrossed with B10.D2 CD4-Cre mice and B10.D2 Thy1.1 mice (Dr. Charles Drake, Johns Hopkins University) and then back-crossed with B10.D2 mice (Taconic) for 10 generations prior to intercrossing to generate DNMT3a2loxP;CD4-Cre+ or CD4-Cre- mice used in experiments. Flow cytometric staining was performed using CD44-FITC, CD4- PE, CD4-PerCP, IFNγ-PE, IL-4-APC, IL-17-PE, and Tbet-PE from BD Biosciences. CD62L-APC, FoxP3-FITC, FoxP3-PE, and GATA3-AF647 were obtained from eBiosciences. Intracellullar staining of cytokines was performed following stimulation of cells in culture with phorbol myristate acetate (50 ng/ml) and ionomycin (500 ng/ml) (Sigma- Aldrich) in the presence of 1:1000 GolgiStop (BD Biosciences). Cells were fixed using the eBioscience FoxP3 Fix/Perm Kit to detect FoxP3, Tbet, or GATA3 along with cytokines or the BD Biosciences Cytofix/Cytoperm kit for detection of cytokines alone. Immunoblotting was performed using rabbit anti-DNMT3a (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, H-295) and rabbit anti-actin (Sigma). For cell culture, anti-CD3ϵ clone 145–2C11, anti-CD28 clone 37.51, and anti-IFNγ clone XMG1.2 were generously provided by Dr. Drew Pardoll, and mAbs were isolated from hybridoma culture supernatant by protein G chromatography. Anti-IL-4 (11B11) was obtained from the National Cancer Institute Biological Repository. Pooled spleen and lymph nodes from DNMT3a2loxP+/+;CD4−Cre+ or CD4-Cre− mice were mechanically dissociated, and CD4 T cells were enriched using the CD4 negative selection kit (Miltenyi Biotech). Cells were stained for CD4, CD44, and CD62L, and naïve CD4 T cells were isolated by flow cytometric sorting of CD4+CD62L+CD44low cells using a FACS Aria II (BD Biosciences). The post sort purity was >98%. Six-well dishes (Falcon) were coated with 5 μg/ml of anti-CD3ϵ in 1 ml of PBS for 2 h, and then plates were washed twice with PBS to remove unbound antibody prior to addition of medium and cells. One to two million cells were cultured in a mixture of 4 ml equal parts of RPMI and Eagle's Ham's Amino Acids (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS (Denville), 1 mm glutamine (Invitrogen), 50 μm 2-mercaptoethanol (Sigma-Aldrich), and antibiotic/antimycotic (Invitrogen). Costimulation was provided by soluble anti-CD28 (2 μg/ml). Murine IL-2, IL-4, IL-12, IL-23, and human TGFβ were obtained from Peprotech. For Th1 cultures, medium was supplemented with IL-12 (10 ng/ml), IL-2 (1 ng/ml), and anti-IL-4 (2 μg/ml). Th2 cultures were supplemented with IL-4 (10 ng/ml), IL-2 (1 ng/ml), and anti-IFNγ (2 μg/ml). Th17 cultures were supplemented with IL-6 (20 ng/ml), TGFβ (2.5 ng/ml), IL-23 (10 ng/ml), anti-IFNγ (2 μg/ml), and anti-IL-4 (2 μg/ml). iTreg cultures were supplemented with TGFβ (5 ng/ml), IL-2 (5 ng/ml), anti-IFNγ (2 μg/ml), and anti-IL-4 (2 μg/ml). After 72 h of stimulation, cells were collected. Th1 and Th2 cells were expanded into an additional 9 volumes of fresh media supplemented with IL-2 (1 ng/ml). Th17 cells were pelleted and resuspended at 2 million per ml in fresh Th17 culture media and replated onto fresh anti-CD3ϵ-coated wells. iTreg cells were expanded into an additional 9 volumes of fresh media supplemented with IL-2 (5 ng/ml). After 4 additional days of culture, cells were collected and used for experiments or recultured as above for an additional week of stimulation. In some experiments, cells previously cultured under Th2, Th17, or iTreg conditions were subsequently cultured under Th1 conditions, as described above. CpG methylation mapping of ifnγ promoter and intron I enhancer was performed by sodium bisulfite method as described previously (15Thomas R.M. Saouaf S.J. Wells A.D. Superantigen-induced CD4+ T cell tolerance is associated with DNA methylation and histone hypo-acetylation at cytokine gene loci.Genes Immun. 2007; 8: 613-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Briefly, 2 μg of genomic DNA was digested with BamHI and HindIII. DNA fragments were purified, denatured with 0.3 m NaOH, followed by conversion of cytosine to uracil by sodium bisulfite treatment. The ifnγ promoter and enhancer was PCR-amplified from converted DNA using previously described primers (15Thomas R.M. Saouaf S.J. Wells A.D. Superantigen-induced CD4+ T cell tolerance is associated with DNA methylation and histone hypo-acetylation at cytokine gene loci.Genes Immun. 2007; 8: 613-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) designed specifically for converted DNA. PCR product was cloned into PGEM. T-easy vector (Promega), and plasmid DNA from 25 to 30 individual clones were sequenced. ChIP analysis for H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 was performed on formaldehyde fixed cells using a ChIP assay kit (Millipore) and following the protocols provided by the vendor. Trimethyl K4 and K27-specific antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling Technologies. DNMT3a ChIP was performed in 1.5-ml tubes using polyclonal anti-DNMT3a or control anti-CD3γ Ab (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The DNA purified from ChIP samples was analyzed for relative enrichment of ifnγ regulatory regions by real-time quantitative PCR with SYBR Green reagents on a StepOne ABI real-time thermal cycler. The relative enrichment of PCR amplified regions was determined as described previously (15Thomas R.M. Saouaf S.J. Wells A.D. Superantigen-induced CD4+ T cell tolerance is associated with DNA methylation and histone hypo-acetylation at cytokine gene loci.Genes Immun. 2007; 8: 613-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). DNMT3a is expressed in naive CD4+ T cells and is up-regulated upon T cell receptor ligation (13Gamper C.J. Agoston A.T. Nelson W.G. Powell J.D. Identification of DNA methyltransferase 3a as a T cell receptor-induced regulator of Th1 and Th2 differentiation.J. Immunol. 2009; 183: 2267-2276Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), but the potential effects of T helper polarization on the expression of this protein have not been studied. We find that Th1 and Th2 cells both express high levels of DNMT3a at the protein level (Fig. 1, A, lanes 1 and 2, and C), with iTreg and Th17 cells exhibiting a more moderate level of expression (Fig. 1, A, lanes 3 and 4, and C). As a first step in determining whether the lack of ifnγ expression by non-Th1 lineage cells involves de novo methylation, we measured DNMT3a occupancy at the ifnγ promoter in differentiated T helper cells by ChIP analysis. Consistent with a previous study (14Jones B. Chen J. Inhibition of IFN-γ transcription by site-specific methylation during T helper cell development.EMBO J. 2006; 25: 2443-2452Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), we find that DNMT3a is not recruited to the ifnγ promoter in Th1 cells (Fig. 1D). However, significant recruitment of DNMT3a could be detected in Th2, Th17, and iTreg cells (Fig. 1D). These data show that, although DNMT3a is expressed by all T helper subsets, this methyltransferase is only recruited to the ifnγ promoter in T helper subsets that do not express this gene. To determine the role of de novo DNA methylation in silencing of the ifnγ gene, we utilized CD4+ T cells from mice that contain a functional DNMT3a gene (DNMT3a2loxP), or from mice in which the dnmt3a gene is deleted specifically in double-positive T lymphocytes (DNMT3a2loxPxCD4-Cre). Deletion of dnmt3a at this stage does not significantly impact T cell development (13Gamper C.J. Agoston A.T. Nelson W.G. Powell J.D. Identification of DNA methyltransferase 3a as a T cell receptor-induced regulator of Th1 and Th2 differentiation.J. Immunol. 2009; 183: 2267-2276Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Consistent with previous analyses (9Winders B.R. Schwartz R.H. Bruniquel D. A distinct region of the murine IFN-γ promoter is hypomethylated from early T cell development through mature naive and Th1 cell differentiation, but is hypermethylated in Th2 cells.J. Immunol. 2004; 173: 7377-7384Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 15Thomas R.M. Saouaf S.J. Wells A.D.

Hutchins A.S. High F.A. Lee H.W. Sykes K.J. Chodosh L.A. Reiner S.L. Hlx is induced by and genetically interacts with T-bet to promote heritable T(H)1 gene induction.Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 652-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar), the promoter region of the ifnγ locus is hypomethylated in CD4+CD62LloCD44hi T cells from DNMT3a2loxP (wild-type) mice (Fig. 2A, left panel), whereas the enhancer region in intron I is hypermethylated (Fig. 2A, right panel). More specifically, the majority of wild-type alleles carried only one methylated CpG in the ifnγ promoter (supplemental Fig. 1A), located 17 bp downstream of the transcriptional start site (Fig. 2A, left panel). However, roughly 20% of alleles exhibited additional methylation at −53, −171, or −205 (Fig. 2A and supplemental Fig. 1A). Conversely, >90% of alleles were methylated at 8/9 or 9/9 CpG dinucleotides located in the intronic enhancer (supplemental Fig. 1A). Naïve CD4+ T cells in which dnmt3a was deleted late in thymic development (DNMT3a-2loxP-CD4-Cre) exhibited a normal pattern and frequency of DNA methylation at the ifnγ locus (Fig. 2A), the only difference being an increase in the frequency of alleles with no methylated CpG dinucleotides in the promoter and a loss of alleles with two or more methylated alleles (supplemental Fig. 1A). Next, we cultured naïve, wild-type, or dnmt3a-deficient CD4+ T cells under Th1-, Th2-, Th17- or iTreg-promoting conditions in vitro through one to two rounds of stimulation. Differentiation of both wild-type and dnmt3a-deficient precursors into Th1 cells was associated with progressive demethylation of the already hypomethylated ifnγ promoter (Fig. 2B, left panels), consistent with the lack of DNMT3a recruitment to the promoter in these cells (Fig. 1D). Indeed, following the second round of polarization the majority of alleles contained no methylated CpG dinucleotides at all (supplemental Fig. 1B). However, although the dynamics of ifnγ promoter methylation occurred independently of DNMT3a in Th1 cells, DNMT3a appeared to oppose demethylation at the intronic enhancer, particularly during the second round of polarization. Wild-type Th1 cells also exhibited a roughly 50% loss of DNA methylation across the entire intronic enhancer after one round of stimulation (Fig. 2B, right panels). This population exhibited a heterogeneous, trimodal allelic distribution, with 20% of the alleles being fully methylated at all 10 CpG dinucleotides, 50% of the alleles methylated at 5, 6, or 7 CpG, whereas 30% of the alleles exhibiting no methylation (supplemental Fig. 1B). Dnmt3a-deficient Th1 cells also showed a loss of methylation at the intronic enhancer during the first round of differentiation; however, this population exhibited a bimodal allelic distribution shifted toward fewer methylated alleles as compared with wild-type Th1 cells. In the absence of DNMT3a, 60% of Th1 alleles contained only 2, 3, or 4 methylated CpG in the intron, 40% of the alleles were methylated at 8 or 9 CpG, and there were no fully methylated alleles. During the second round of Th1 polarization, wild-type cells exhibited de novo DNA methylation at the intron, particularly at the CpG dinucleotides located at +264 and +419 (Fig. 2B). This was associated with a decrease in the frequency of fully demethylated alleles and a more even “spreading” pattern typified by a roughly equal distribution of alleles with 0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 10 methylated CpG dinucleotides (supplemental Fig. 1B). However, 85% of the alleles from dnmt3a-deficient Th1 cells contained four or fewer methylated CpG, with those CpG located at +264, +304, +344, and +607 exhibiting the greatest differential methylation compared with wild-type. These data indicate that de novo methylation mediated by DNMT3a balances loss of maintenance methylation at the intronic enhancer. Consistent with the observed DNMT3a occupancy at the ifnγ promoter (Fig. 1D), a marked increase in DNA methylation was observed at the promoter in wild-type Th2, Th17, and iTreg lineages (Fig. 2, C–E, left panels). This de novo methylation was particularly pronounced at the −53, −205, and −375 CpG sites. A distinct bimodal distribution was established in differentiating Th2 cells, with ∼40% of the alleles exhibiting only 1 or 2 methylated CpG, whereas 60% of the alleles had accumulated up to 7 methylated CpG (supplemental Fig. 1C). This type of monoallelic behavior has been observed at the il4 locus in Th2 cells (17Bix M. Locksley R.M. Independent and epigenetic regulation of the interleukin-4 alleles in CD4+ T cells.Science. 1998; 281: 1352-1354Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) and is reminiscent of imprinting of maternal or paternal alleles in the fertilized egg, a process known to be dependent upon DNMT3a (12Okano M. Bell D.W. Haber D.A. Li E. DNA methyltransferases Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b are essential for de novo methylation and mammalian development.Cell. 1999; 99: 247-257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4484) Google Scholar). Indeed, Th2, Th17, and iTreg cells lacking DNMT3a completely failed to methylate the ifnγ promoter (Fig. 2, C–E), whereas loss of DNMT3a did not influence the intronic enhancer, which remained hypermethylated in all non-Th1 lineages (Fig. 2, C–E, right panels). Retroviral transduction of dnmt3a-deficient Th2 cells with wild-type DNMT3a but not with a catalytically inactive mutant of DNMT3a that is able to bind to chromatin was able to restore de novo methylation of the ifnγ promoter (supplemental Fig. 2). These results indicate that dysregulation of DNA methylation in dnmt3a-deficient CD4+ T cells is not due to a broader developmental defect and together demonstrate that DNMT3a is necessary and sufficient for the de novo DNA methylation observed at the ifnγ locus in non-Th1 lineages. To test whether de novo DNA methylation regulates other epigenetic processes at the ifnγ locus, we measured the levels of two opposing chromatin modifications, trimethylation (me3) of lysine 4 versus lysine 27 of histone H3. In wild-type and dnmt3a-deficient naïve CD4+ T cells, the ifnγ locus exhibits very low levels of H3K4me3 (Fig. 3A, dark green bars), a mark of active transcription, and low to moderate levels of H3K27me3 (Fig. 3A, dark red bars), a mark associated with transcriptionally silent genes, at the promoter, and three distinct enhancer regions. Differentiation of wild-type and dnmt3a-deficient CD4+ T cells toward the Th1 lineage was associated with a loss of H3K27 methylation and a strong increase in H3K4 methylation at the ifnγ locus (Fig. 3B). Conversely, differentiation of wild-type CD4+ T cells toward the Th2, Th17, and iTreg lineages was associated with a strong increase in the H3K27me3 silencing mark, with little or no increase in the active H3K4me3 mark (Fig. 3, C–E). Th2, Th17, and iTreg differentiated in the absence of DNMT3a exhibited a general decrease in H3K27me3 at the promoter and enhancer regions (Fig. 3, C–E, light red bars). Loss of de novo DNA methylation in Th17 cells did not result in an increase in H3K4 methylation (Fig. 3D, light green bars). However, the CNS-22 enhancer accumulated a significant degree of H3K4 methylation in dnmt3a-deficient Th2 cells (Fig. 3C, light green bars), and differentiation of dnmt3a-deficient CD4 cells into iTreg was accompanied by moderate H3K4me3 methylation at both the promoter and the intronic enhancer (Fig. 3E, light green bars). These data demonstrate that de novo DNA methylation influences histone methylation at the ifnγ locus during T helper differentiation. Methylation of CpG dinucleotides in the ifnγ promoter has been shown to inhibit transcription (8Young H.A. Ghosh P. Ye J. Lederer J. Lichtman A. Gerard J.R. Penix L. Wilson C.B. Melvin A.J.

Therefore, we predicted that dnmt3a-deficient T cells might exhibit increased expression of the ifnγ gene upon Th2, Th17, and iTreg differentiation. To test this, we restimulated primary cultures of wild-type and dnmt3a-deficient Th1, Th2, Th17, and iTreg with PMA and ionomycin and assessed cytokine production by intracellular staining and ELISA. Interestingly, non-Th1 helper cultures lacking DNMT3a did not produce more IFNγ than wild-type cultures (Fig. 4, B–E), consistent with the lack of H3K4 histone methylation in these populations (Fig. 3). Also, the absence of DNMT3a did not significantly influence the production of IFNγ by Th1 cultures (Fig. 4, A and E), IL-4 or IL-13 production by Th2 cultures (Fig. 4, B, F, and G), IL-17-producing cells in Th17 cultures (Fig. 4, C and H), or the frequency of Foxp3+ cells in iTreg cultures (Fig. 4D). The similar pattern of cytokine expression from polarized wild-type and dnmt3a-deficient T cells also corresponded with similar patterns of Tbet and GATA3 expression by intracellular staining with the exce"
https://openalex.org/W2094500687,"Publications worldwide have reported on the re-occurrence of human enterovirus 68 (EV68), a rarely detected pathogen usually causing respiratory illness. However, epidemiological data regarding this virus in particular on the Asian continent has so far been limited.We investigated the epidemiology and genetic variability of EV68 infection among Thai children with respiratory illnesses from 2006-2011 (n = 1810). Semi-nested PCR using primer sets for amplification of the 5'-untranslated region through VP2 was performed for rhino-enterovirus detection. Altogether, 25 cases were confirmed as EV68 infection indicating a prevalence of 1.4% in the entire study population. Interestingly, the majority of samples were children aged >5 years (64%). Also, co-infection with other viruses was found in 28%, while pandemic H1N1 influenza/2009 virus was the most common co-infection. Of EV68-positive patients, 36% required hospitalizations with the common clinical presentations of fever, cough, dyspnea, and wheezing. The present study has shown that EV68 was extremely rare until 2009 (0.9%). An increasing annual prevalence was found in 2010 (1.6%) with the highest detection frequency in 2011 (4.3%). Based on analysis of the VP1 gene, the evolutionary rate of EV68 was estimated at 4.93 × 10(-3) substitutions/site/year. Major bifurcation of the currently circulating EV68 strains occurred 66 years ago (1945.31 with (1925.95-1960.46)95% HPD). Among the current lineages, 3 clusters of EV68 were categorized based on the different molecular signatures in the BC and DE loops of VP1 combined with high posterior probability values. Each cluster has branched off from their common ancestor at least 36 years ago (1975.78 with (1946.13-1984.97)95% HPD).Differences in epidemiological characteristic and seasonal profile of EV68 have been found in this study. Results from Bayesian phylogenetic investigations also revealed that EV68 should be recognized as a genetically diverse virus with a substitution rate identical to that of enterovirus 71 genotype B (4.2 × 10(-3 )s/s/y)."

IL-HFS applied immediately after fear memory retrieval, but not three hours after retrieval or prior to conditioning, subsequently reduced freezing during fear extinction. Similarly, IL-HFS given immediately, but not three hours after, retrieval of a CTA memory reduced aversion during extinction.

Many studies for Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) allelic association with RA have been reported, but few have been validated in an RA subpopulation with ILD. In this study, we investigated the association of HLA class II alleles with ILD in RA. Methods An association study was conducted on HLA-DRB1, DQB1, and DPB1 in 450 Japanese RA patients that were or were not diagnosed with ILD, based on the findings of computed tomography images of the chest. Results Unexpectedly, HLA-DRB1*04 (corrected P [Pc] = 0.0054, odds ratio [OR] 0.57), shared epitope (SE) (P = 0.0055, OR 0.66) and DQB1*04 (Pc = 0.0036, OR 0.57) were associated with significantly decreased risk of ILD.

However, the molecular mechanisms that dictate Arc mRNA and protein dynamics during and after cholinergic epochs are little understood. Using human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells, we show that muscarinic cholinergic receptor (mAchR) stimulation triggers Arc synthesis, whereas translation-dependent RNA decay and proteasomal degradation strictly limit the amount and duration of Arc expression. Chronic application of the mAchR agonist, carbachol (Cch), induces Arc transcription via ERK signaling and release of calcium from IP3-sensitive stores. Arc translation requires ERK activation, but not changes in intracellular calcium. Proteasomal degradation of Arc (half-life ∼37 min) was enhanced by thapsigargin, an inhibitor of the endoplasmic calcium-ATPase pump. Similar mechanisms of Arc protein regulation were observed in cultured rat hippocampal slices. Functionally, we studied the impact of cholinergic epoch duration and temporal pattern on Arc protein expression. Acute Cch treatment (as short as 2 min) induces transient, moderate Arc expression, whereas continuous treatment of more than 30 min induces maximal expression, followed by rapid decline. Cholinergic activity associated with rapid eye movement sleep may function to facilitate long term synaptic plasticity and memory. Employing a paradigm designed to mimic intermittent rapid eye movement sleep epochs, we show that application of Cch in a series of short bursts generates persistent and maximal Arc protein expression.

https://openalex.org/W2030032466,"Sepsis is one of the leading causes of acute kidney injury (AKI). Septic patients who develop acute kidney injury (AKI) are at increased risk of death. To date there is no effective treatment for AKI or septic AKI. Based on their anti-inflammatory properties, we examined the effects of nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonists on renal damage using a mouse model of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced AKI where localized LPS promotes inflammation-mediated kidney damage. Administration of nicotine (1 mg/kg) or GTS-21 (4 mg/kg) significantly abrogated renal leukocyte infiltration (by 40%) and attenuated kidney injury. These renoprotective effects were accompanied by reduced systemic and localized kidney inflammation during LPS-induced AKI. Consistent with these observations, nicotinic agonist treatment significantly decreased renal IκBα degradation and NFκB activation during LPS-induced AKI. Treatment of human kidney cells with nicotinic agonists, an NFκB inhibitor (Bay11), or a proteasome inhibitor (MG132) effectively inhibited their inflammatory responses following stimulation with LPS or TNFα. Renal proteasome activity, a major regulator of NFκB-mediated inflammation, was enhanced by approximately 50% during LPS-induced AKI and elevated proteasome activity was significantly blunted by nicotinic agonist administration in vivo. Taken together, our results identify enhanced renal proteasome activity during LPS-induced AKI and the suppression of both proteasome activity and inflammation by nicotinic agonists to attenuate LPS-induced kidney injury."

Despite the identification of the 43 kDa transactive response DNA-binding protein (TDP-43) as a major pathological signatory protein in a wide range of neurodegenerative diseases, the mechanistic role of TDP-43 in neurodegenerative disorders is still poorly understood.

In particular, TDP-43 is predominantly a nuclear protein containing two RNA recognition motifs (RRM) and a C-terminal glycine-rich domain (GRD).

Despite the advance in the characterization of the biological activity of the TDP-43 protein, there is still much to be learned about the molecular mechanisms underlying the cellular function of TDP-43. Here we report that TDP-43 physically interacts with fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) and Staufen (STAU1) to form a functionally coordinated complex. Differential microarray analysis in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells identified a series of functionally important genes including Sirtuin (SIRT1) that are targeted by this complex. We showed that TDP-43/FMPR/STAU1 complex binds specifically to SIRT1 3′-UTR, and that knockdown the expression of any one of these three proteins resulted in the reduction of SIRT1 mRNA and protein levels. We demonstrated that depletion of TDP-43 sensitizes SH-SY5Y cells to DNA damages and apoptosis. Full-length TDP-43 were amplified from cDNA of SH-SY5Y cells and cloned through BamH1/XhoI into pCMV-Tag-2B-Flag vector (Agilent). TDP-43 mutants (D169G, G287S, G290A, G298S, and R361S,) were generated using site-directed mutagenesis according to the manufacturer's instructions (Agilent). TDP-43 deletion mutants including ΔRRM1 (Δ106–176aa), ΔRRM2 (Δ191–262aa), ΔRRM1+ΔRRM2/ΔRRMs (Δ106–262aa), ΔGRN (Δ274–414aa), and ΔNLS (Δ82–98aa) were PCR-amplified and subcloned into pCMV-Tag-2B-Flag vector according to the standard protocols. TDP-43 mutants were generated by quick change site-directed mutagenesis (Agilent). The sources of the antibodies were: anti-FLAG (clone M2), anti-TDP-43 (polyclonal), anti-TDP-43 (monoclonal), anti-α-tubulin, and anti-Flag M2 affinity gel (Sigma); anti-FMRP (Abcam), and anti-SIRT1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); anti-STAU1 (MBL); anti-HuR (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Camptothecin (CPT) was purchased from Sigma. Protein A/G-Sepharose CL-4B beads were from Amersham Biosciences, and protease inhibitor mixture mixture was from Roche Applied Science. All siRNAs were synthesized by Genepharma and the target sequences are listed in supplemental Table S3. SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells and HEK293T human embryonic kidney cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Transient transfections were performed with Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (for siRNA transfection) and Lipofectamine 2000 (for plasmid transfection) according to the company's specification (Invitrogen). SH-SY5Y nuclear extracts were prepared with Nuclear-Cytosol Extraction kit (Applygen Technologies). Approximately 6 mg of nuclear protein was concentrated to 500 μl using a Millipore Ultra free centrifugal filter apparatus (10 kDa nominal molecular mass limit), and then applied to Superose 6 size exclusion column (Amersham Biosciences) that had been equilibrated with PBS and calibrated with protein standards (blue dextran, 2000 kDa; thyroglobulin, 669 kDa; ferritin, 440 kDa; aldolase, 158 kDa; bovine serum albumin, 67 kDa; and Cornonin, 44 kDa; all from Amersham Biosciences). The column was eluted at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min and fractions were collected every 500 μl. For immunoblotting, SH-SY5Y were harvested and extracted in RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate) including protease inhibitor mixture (Roche) and centrifuged, and 50 μg of the supernatant was subjected to SDS-PAGE using 8 or 10% polyacrylamide gels and transferred onto nitrocellulose. Membranes were incubated with primary antibodies (anti-SIRT1, FMRP, STAU1, or TDP-43 antibodies) overnight at 4 °C followed by HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies. For immunoprecipitation assays, cellular extracts were incubated with appropriate primary antibodies or normal rabbit/mouse immunoglobin G (IgG) at 4 °C overnight, followed by addition of protein A/G-Sepharose CL-4B beads for 2 h at 4 °C. Beads were then washed and the immune complexes were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting with secondary antibodies. Immunodetection was performed using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL System, Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA was isolated with Trizol (Invitrogen) and treated with DNase I. After reverse transcription with AccessQuick™ RT-PCR System (Promega), real-time PCR was conducted on an ABI 7500 real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems). cDNA synthesis and amplification were performed according to the manufacturer's instruction. The primers used were listed in supplemental Table S4. RIP assays were performed using the Magna RIP Kit purchased from Millipore (cat. No. 17-700). SH-SY5Y cells (48 h after transfection) were collected and lysed in 500 μl of RIP lysis buffer supplemented with protease inhibitor and RNase inhibitor. 10% of the total lysate was processed in parallel to obtain the total input sample. After 5 min of incubation on ice, 50 μl of magnetic beads suspension was transferred to each tube. The beads were washed two times using 500 μl of RIP wash buffer, then add ∼5 μg of anti-TDP-43, anti-FMRP, and anti-STAU1 antibodies at room temperature for 30 min. The beads were washed five times with wash buffer, then in 900 μl of immunoprecipitation buffer (0.5 m EDTA, RNase inhibitor, and RIP wash buffer) at 4 °C for overnight. RNA was purified using proteinase K buffer (RIP wash buffer, 10% SDS, and 10 mg/ml proteinase K) and precipitated with Salt Solution I, Salt Solution II, Precipitate Enhancer and then absolute ethanol. The isolated RNA from RIP was analyzed by quantitative RT-PCR. The results were expressed as the relative fold enrichment of the target precipitation as compared with the normal rabbit IgG control. The primers used were listed in supplemental Table S5. cDNA was used as a template for PCR amplification of different SIRT1 untranslated regions (UTR) and coding regions (CR). All forward primers contained the T7 promoter sequence (T7), CAGAGATGCATAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGA. To prepare 5′-UTR-A transcript (positions 1 to 53), forward primer, (T7) GTCGAGCGGGAGCAGAG and reverse primer, CTTCCAACTGCCTCTCTGG were used. To prepare CR-B transcript (positions 54 to 754), forward primer, (T7) ATGGCGGACGAGGCG and reverse primer, TTTTTGGTGGTTCTGAAGGATA were used. To prepare CR-C transcript (positions 755 to 1653), forward primer, (T7) GGAAAAAAAGAAAAGATATTAAT and reverse primer, TGAAGAATCTGGTGGTGAA were used. To prepare CR-D transcript (positions 1654 to 2324), forward primer, (T7) GTGATTGTCACACTTTTAGACC and reverse primer, CTATGATTTGTTTGATGGATAGT were used. To prepare 3′-UTR-E transcript (positions 2325 to 2924), forward primer, (T7) TGTAATAATTGTGCAGGTACAGG and reverse primer, TCTCCCCACATATTGTTGACTTCCT were used. To prepare 3′-UTR-F transcript (positions 2925 to 3473), forward primer, (T7) GCACTCGGTTGTCTTTACTT and CCAGTAGAAGTACCATTATTATAGA were used. To prepare 3′-UTR-G transcript (positions 3474 to 4110), forward primer, (T7) GGAGAGTGTAATATTTTGGACTG and TAAGTTAACAGAAAAAAGTCAAATG were used. For biotin pull-down assay, PCR-amplified DNA was used as a template to transcribe biotinylated RNA by using T7 RNA polymerase in the presence of biotin-UTP and was purified as previously described (29Wang W. Martindale J.L. Yang X. Chrest F.J. Gorospe M. Increased stability of the p16 mRNA with replicative senescence.EMBO Rep. 2005; 6: 158-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). SH-SY5Y cells were seeded onto 6-well plates for 24 h and transfected with indicated siRNAs using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Invitrogen). 12 h later, the cells were transfected with appropriate plasmid constructs using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). After 48 h of the plasmid transfection, cells were harvested, and TUNEL assay were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (TB235, Promega) with a fluorescence method. SH-SY5Ycells were seeded onto 24-well plates for 24 h and transfected with indicated siRNAs using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Invitrogen). 12 h later, the cells were transfected with appropriate plasmid constructs using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). After 24 h of the plasmid transfection, CPT (0.2 μg/ml in DMSO) or DMSO were added for another 24 h and cell viability assays were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (TB 288, Promega) with a luminescent method. In an effort to further explore the mechanistic role of TDP-43 in neuronal cells, we employed affinity purification and mass spectrometry to identify the proteins that are associated with TDP-43 in vivo. In these experiments, FLAG-tagged TDP-43 (FLAG-TDP-43) was stably expressed in SH-SY5Y cells. Cellular extracts were prepared and subjected to affinity purification using an anti-FLAG affinity gel. Mass spectrometric analysis indicates that TDP-43 co-purified with hnRNP A0, A1, A2/B1, K, L, Q, R, and FUS, as reported previously (30Ling S.C. Albuquerque C.P. Han J.S. Lagier-Tourenne C.

Interestingly, TDP-43 also co-purified with FMRP and STAU1 (Fig. 1A), two proteins that are reported to be also involved in multiple RNA-processing events (32Zalfa F. Eleuteri B. Dickson K.S.

The presence of FMRP, STAU1, hnRNP A2/B1, hnRNP K, and hnRNP Q/R in the TDP-43-associated protein complex was confirmed by Western blotting analysis (Fig. 1B). The detailed results of the mass spectrometric analysis are provided in supplemental Table S1. To further support the observation that TDP-43 is physically associated with FMRP and STAU1 in vivo, co-immunoprecipitation experiments were performed. In these experiments, total proteins from SH-SY5Y cells were extracted and immunoprecipitated with antibodies against TDP-43 followed by immunoblotting with antibodies against FMRP or STAU1. The results showed that both FMRP and STAU1 could be efficiently co-immunoprecipitated by TDP-43 (Fig. 1C, middle and lower panels). Reciprocal immunoprecipitations with antibodies against FMRP or STAU1 followed by immunoblotting with antibodies against TDP-43 also confirmed that association of TDP-43 with FMRP and STAU1 in vivo (Fig. 1C, upper panel). The association of TDP-43 with FMRP and STAU1 was also detected in human embryonic kidney HEK 293T cells (Fig. 1D). Taken together, these data indicate that a TDP-43/FMRP/STAU1-containing protein complex exists in both neuronal and non-neuronal cell lines. The interaction of TDP-43 with FMRP and STAU1 suggests that these proteins may function in a concerted manner to regulate expression of certain target genes. To further support the observation that TDP-43, FMRP, and STAU1 exist in the same complex in vivo, protein fractionation experiments were carried out by fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC). Nuclear extracts derived from SH-SY5Y cells were fractionated by DEAE Sepharose, followed by superpose 6 gel filtration chromatography. Western blotting revealed a major peak at about 669–1000 kDa for TDP-43, and also for the FMRP, STAU1, and hnRNP K, whereas the hnRNP A2/B1 preferred a monomer style (Fig. 1E). Significantly, the elution pattern of TDP-43 was largely overlapped with that of FMRP and STAU1, further supporting the notion that these proteins may form a functionally coordinated complex in vivo. As mentioned above, it is believed that TDP-43 mainly functions as an RNA-binding protein to affect the mRNA processing of target genes (16Lagier-Tourenne C. Polymenidou M. Cleveland D.W.

To further investigate TDP-43 downstream target genes, RNA microarray analysis was performed in SH-SY5Y cells with the expression of TDP-43 knocked down by RNA interference (RNAi). Total RNA was extracted and hybridized on a Human Genome U133 + 2.0 array (Affymetrix). Compared with control, a total of 258 altered specific mRNA targets by microarray expression profiling in TDP-43-silenced cells were identified (supplemental Table S2).

https://openalex.org/W2074010408,"Androgen receptor (AR) plays a pivotal role in prostate cancer. Regulation of AR transcriptional activity by post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation by multiple kinases, is well documented. Here, we report that two PIM-1 kinase isoforms which are up-regulated during prostate cancer progression, namely PIM-1S and PIM-1L, modulate AR stability and transcriptional activity through differentially phosphorylating AR at serine 213 (Ser-213) and threonine 850 (Thr-850). Although both kinases are capable of interacting with and phosphorylating AR at Ser-213, only PIM-1L could phosphorylate Thr-850. We also showed that PIM-1S induced Ser-213 phosphorylation destabilizes AR by recruiting the ubiquitin E3 ligase Mdm2 and promotes AR degradation in a cell cycle-dependent manner, while PIM-1L-induced Thr-850 phosphorylation stabilizes AR by recruiting the ubiquitin E3 ligase RNF6 and promotes AR-mediated transcription under low-androgen conditions. Furthermore, both PIM-1 isoforms could promote prostate cancer cell growth under low-androgen conditions. Our data suggest that these kinases regulate AR stability and transcriptional activity through recruitment of different functional partners in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. As AR turnover has been previously shown to be critical for cell cycle progression in prostate cancer cells, PIM-1 kinase isoforms may promote prostate cancer cell growth, at least in part, through modulating AR activity via distinct mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2016028728,"Asthma comorbidity has been correlated with poor asthma control, increased health services use, and decreased quality of life. Managing it improves these outcomes. Little is known about the amount of different types of comorbidity associated with asthma and how they vary by age.The authors conducted a population study using health administrative data on all individuals living in Ontario, Canada (population 12 million). Types of asthma comorbidity were quantified by comparing physician health care claims between individuals with and without asthma in each of 14 major disease categories; results were adjusted for demographic factors and other comorbidity and stratified by age. Compared to those without asthma, individuals with asthma had higher rates of comorbidity in most major disease categories. Most notably, they had about fifty percent or more physician health care claims for respiratory disease (other than asthma) in all age groups; psychiatric disorders in individuals age four and under and age 18 to 44; perinatal disorders in individuals 17 years and under, and metabolic and immunity, and hematologic disorders in children four years and under.Asthma appears to be associated with significant rates of various types of comorbidity that vary according to age. These results can be used to develop strategies to recognize and address asthma comorbidity to improve the overall health of individuals with asthma."

Such polymorphisms could directly affect the binding of microRNA to hundreds of target mRNAs. It remains unknown whether rs4919510:C>G located in the mature miR-608 alters breast cancer susceptibility. Methods The association of rs4919510:C>G with risk and pathologic features of breast cancer were investigated in two independent case-control studies, the first set including 1,138 sporadic breast cancer patients (including 927 invasive ductal carcinoma patients, 777 of them with known subtypes: 496 luminal-like, 133 HER2-positive, and 148 triple-negative) and 1,434 community-based controls, and the second set including 294 familial/early-onset breast cancer patients and 500 hospital-based cancer-free controls. Odds ratios (ORs) were estimated by logistic regression. Predicted targets of miR-608 and complementary sequences containing rs4919510:C>G were surveyed to reveal potential pathological mechanism. Results In the first set, although rs4919510:C>G was unrelated to breast cancer in general patients, variant genotypes (CG/GG) were specifically associated with increased risk of HER2-positive subtype (Adjusted OR = 1.97, 95% CI, 1.34−2.90 in the recessive model). Variant G-allele was the risk allele with OR of 1.62 (95% CI, 1.23−2.15). Patients carrying GG-genotype also had larger HER2-positive tumors (P for Kruskal-Wallis test = 0.006). The relationship between rs4919510:C>G and risk of HER2-positive subgroup was validated in the second set (Bonferroni corrected P = 0.06). The adjusted combined OR (total 164 HER2-positive cases) in the recessive model was 1.97 (95% CI, 1.43−2.72) for GG genotype (corrected P = 1.1×10−4). Bioinformatic analysis indicated that, HSF1, which is required for HER2-induced tumorigenesis, might be a target of miR-608. The minimum free-energy of ancestral-miR-608 (C-allele) binding to HSF1 is −35.9 kcal/mol, while that of variant-form (G-allele) is −31.5 kcal/mol, indicating a lower affinity of variant-miR-608 to HSF1 mRNA. Conclusion rs4919510:C>G in mature miR-608 may influence HER2-positive breast cancer risk and tumor proliferation."

https://openalex.org/W1976619501,"Peptide Nucleic Acids (PNAs), nucleic acid analogues showing high stability to enzyme degradation and strong affinity and specificity of binding toward DNA and RNA are widely investigated as tools to interfere in gene expression. Several studies have been focused on PNA analogues with modifications on the backbone and bases in the attempt to overcome solubility, uptake and aggregation issues. γ PNAs, PNA derivatives having a substituent in the γ position of the backbone show interesting properties in terms of secondary structure and affinity of binding toward complementary nucleic acids. In this paper we illustrate our results obtained on new analogues, bearing a sulphate in the γ position of the backbone, developed to be more DNA-like in terms of polarity and charge. The synthesis of monomers and oligomers is described. NMR studies on the conformational properties of monomers and studies on the secondary structure of single strands and triplexes are reported. Furthermore the hybrid stability and the effect of mismatches on the stability have also been investigated.

Helicases are molecular motors that couple the energy of nucleoside triphosphate (NTP) hydrolysis to the unwinding and remodeling of structured DNA or RNA (1Lohman T.M. Bjornson K.P.

Essential molecular motor proteins for cellular machinery.Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 1835-1848Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Helicases are important in DNA metabolism and are implicated in the cellular processes of replication, DNA repair, recombination, transcription, chromosome segregation, and telomere maintenance (4Brosh Jr., R.M. Bohr V.A. Human premature aging, DNA repair, and RecQ helicases.Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: 7527-7544Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 5Pyle A.M. Translocation and unwinding mechanisms of RNA and DNA helicases.Annu. Rev. Biophys. 2008; 37: 317-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). The conversion of the energy derived from NTP hydrolysis into unwinding of double-stranded nucleic acids is coordinated by seven sequence motifs (I, Ia, II, III, IV, V, and VI), which are the feature motifs of superfamily-1 and -2 helicases (6Singleton M.R. Dillingham M.S. Wigley D.B. Structure and mechanism of helicases and nucleic acid translocases.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2007; 76: 23-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (956) Google Scholar). These motifs are usually clustered in a region of 200–700 amino acids called the helicase core domain. Because of the sequence of motif II (DEAD or DEAH or DEXH), the helicase family is also called the DEAD box (or DEAH or DEXH) protein family. Structural studies have demonstrated that the conserved helicase motifs are closely associated in the tertiary structure of helicases and are located in specific positions within the two so-called RecA-like domains coordinating ATP binding and hydrolysis to DNA unwinding (6Singleton M.R.

The Q motif (Gly-Phe-Xaa-Xaa-Pro-Xaa-Pro-Ile-Gln) was first identified in DEAD box RNA helicases. It is located ∼17 amino acids upstream of motif I (i.e. Walker A box) and consists of a nine-amino acid sequence containing an invariant glutamine (Q) residue (9Tanner N.K. Cordin O. Banroques J.

Cell. 2003; 11: 127-138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Site-specific mutagenesis studies demonstrated that the Q motif controls ATP binding and hydrolysis in the yeast translation initiation factor eIF4A, and in vivo analyses in yeast showed that the Q motif and upstream aromatic group are important for cell viability (9Tanner N.K.

Cell. 2003; 11: 127-138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). The Q motif was also shown to be important for ATPase activity of a viral helicase, NS3 (10Gallivan J.P. McGarvey M.J. The importance of the Q motif in the ATPase activity of a viral helicase.FEBS Lett. 2003; 554: 485-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Aromatic residues were proposed to aid in hydrophobic stacking interactions with the adenine (11Tanner N.K. The newly identified Q motif of DEAD box helicases is involved in adenine recognition.Cell Cycle. 2003; 2: 18-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The Q motif not only regulates ATP binding and hydrolysis but also regulates the affinity of yeast translation initiation factor Ded1 for RNA substrates and its helicase activity (12Cordin O.

The newly discovered Q motif of DEAD-box RNA helicases regulates RNA-binding and helicase activity.EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2478-2487Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). It was further proposed that the Q motif in eIF4A and Ded1 RNA helicases functions as a molecular on-off switch for ATP hydrolysis and helicase activity (11Tanner N.K. The newly identified Q motif of DEAD box helicases is involved in adenine recognition.Cell Cycle. 2003; 2: 18-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 12Cordin O. Tanner N.K. Doère M. Linder P.

A very recent study of the RNA helicase Hera examined the effect of the glutamic acid substituted for the invariant glutamine within the Q motif. This work suggested that the Q motif is responsible for sensing the nucleotide state of the helicase and establishing a stable interaction of the Walker A box (P-loop) with other helicase motifs, and this stabilization is required for catalytic competence (13Strohmeier J. Hertel I. Diederichsen U. Rudolph M.G. Klostermeier D. Changing nucleotide specificity of the DEAD-box helicase Hera abrogates communication between the Q-motif and the P-loop.Biol. Chem. 2011; 392: 357-369Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The Q motif, also called motif 0 in RecQ helicases, is well known for being conserved among most SF1 and SF2 DNA helicases as well. Several crystal structures of DNA helicases have been determined that show that the conserved glutamine is structurally important for nucleotide binding.

For example, the Q motif of phage λ packaging motor was shown to be involved in DNA-motor interactions and governs its force-generating ability (18Tsay J.M. Sippy J. Feiss M. Smith D.E.

Fanconi anemia group J protein Bloom syndrome protein G-quadruplex telomestatin adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate) single strand DNA telomestatin mitomycin C hydroxyurea. In this work, we investigated the importance of the Q motif in FANCJ for its biochemical and cellular functions. Replacement of the invariant glutamine in the Q motif of FANCJ with an alanine impaired ATP hydrolysis, abolished FANCJ helicase activity, and eliminated its ability to catalytically strip protein bound to DNA. The FANCJ Q motif mutant was impaired for DNA binding but displayed ATP binding and a temperature-induced folding transition similar to wild-type FANCJ. The FANCJ Q mutant allele failed to rescue cisplatin or telomestatin sensitivity of a FA-J null cell line, and expression of the FANCJ Q mutant in a wild-type background exerted a dominant negative effect. Taken together, the biochemical and genetic analyses demonstrate that the Q motif in FANCJ is essential for its catalytic activity and DNA repair function in vivo. The Q motif mutations were generated by QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Stratagene) using respective primers (supplemental Table S1) in the vectors of pVL1392 (27Cantor S.

All desired mutations and constructs were confirmed by direct DNA sequencing using the purified plasmids. Baculovirus encoding FANCJ-WT, FANCJ-Q25A, or FANCJ-ΔQ with a C-terminal FLAG tag was used to infect High Five insect cells, and the recombinant FANCJ proteins were purified with modifications to a protocol previously described (27Cantor S.

Briefly, cell pellets were resuspended in buffer A (10 mm Tris·HCl (pH 7.5), 130 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 10 mm NaF, 10 mm NaPi, 10 mm NaPPi). Cells were lysed in the presence of protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science) for 45 min at 4 °C with mild agitation and centrifuged at 21,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was incubated with FLAG antibody resin (Sigma) for 2 h at 4 °C. The resin was washed twice with buffer B (50 mm Tris·HCl (pH 7.4), 500 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) followed by buffer C (50 mm Tris·HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40). FANCJ was eluted with 4 μg/ml 3× FLAG peptide (Sigma) in buffer D (25 mm Tris·HCl (pH 7.4), 100 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Tween 20, 5 mm Tris (2-carboxyethyl) phosphine hydrochloride) (Sigma) for 1 h. FLAG-tagged FANCJ proteins were dialyzed for 2 h against buffer D using a dialysis tube with a 50-kDa molecular weight cutoff (Tube-O-DIALYZERTM), and aliquots were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. The concentrations of wild-type and mutant FANCJ proteins were determined by Bradford (Bio-Rad) using bovine serum albumin (BSA) as a standard. Although there is protein-protein variability because protein assays detect protein-specific functional groups, the FANCJ protein concentrations determined by Bradford were in close agreement with those obtained from the 660 nm assay (Pierce) using BSA as a standard. Wild-type and mutant purified FANCJ proteins were analyzed for SYPRO Orange-based thermal unfolding (33Ericsson U.B. Hallberg B.M. Detitta G.T. Dekker N. Nordlund P. Thermofluor-based high throughput stability optimization of proteins for structural studies.Anal. Biochem. 2006; 357: 289-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar) using a MX3005P real time PCR cycler (Stratagene). The unfolding curves were recorded in triplicate from at least two different protein batches in their final storage buffer (see above). PAGE-purified oligonucleotides used for the preparation of DNA substrates were purchased from Loftstrand Labs (Gaithersburg, MD) and are listed in supplemental Table S2. The forked duplex DNA substrate was prepared from the DC26 and TSTEM25 oligonucleotides as described previously (28Gupta R. Sharma S. Sommers J.A. Jin Z. Cantor S.B. Brosh Jr., R.M.

Helicase assay reaction mixtures (20 μl) contained 40 mm Tris·HCl (pH 7.4), 25 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 2% glycerol, 100 ng/μl bovine serum albumin, 2 mm ATP, 10 fmol of the specified tetraplex or duplex DNA substrate, and the indicated concentrations of FANCJ. Helicase reactions were initiated by the addition of FANCJ and incubated at 30 °C for 15 min unless otherwise indicated. Helicase reactions were terminated by addition of Stop buffer containing EDTA. Reaction products were resolved on nondenaturing 8 or 12% (19:1 acrylamide/bisacrylamide) polyacrylamide gels for the G4 and forked duplex substrates, respectively, and quantitated as described previously (30Wu Y. Shin-ya K. Brosh Jr., R.M. FANCJ helicase defective in Fanconia anemia and breast cancer unwinds G-quadruplex DNA to defend genomic stability.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2008; 28: 4116-4128Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Protein/DNA binding mixtures (20 μl) contained the indicated concentrations of FANCJ and 0.5 nm of the specified 32P-end-labeled DNA substrate in the same reaction buffer as that used for helicase assays (see above) containing 2 mm ATPγS or no nucleotide. The binding mixtures were incubated at 24 °C for 30 min after the addition of FANCJ. After incubation, 3 μl of Loading dye (74% glycerol, 0.01% xylene cyanol, 0.01% bromphenol blue) was added to each mixture, and samples were loaded onto native 5% (19:1 acrylamide/bisacrylamide) polyacrylamide gels and electrophoresed at 200 V for 2 h at 4 °C using 1× TBE as the Running buffer. The resolved radiolabeled species were visualized using a PhosphorImager and analyzed with ImageQuant software (GE Healthcare). ATP hydrolysis was measured using [γ-32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and analysis by thin layer chromatography (TLC) on polyethyleneimine-cellulose plates (Mallinckrodt Baker). The standard reaction mixture (20 μl total volume) contained 40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 25 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 2% glycerol, 100 ng/μl bovine serum albumin, 250 μm [γ-32P]ATP, 60 nm FANCJ protein and was incubated at 30 °C. The product was spotted onto a polyethyleneimine-cellulose TLC plate and resolved by using 0.5 m LiCl, 1 m formic acid as the carrier solvent. The TLC plate was exposed to a PhosphorImager cassette for 1 h and visualized using a PhosphorImager and analyzed with ImageQuant software. For experiments to determine Km(ATP), M13mp18 ssDNA was used at 2.1 nm; the concentration of ATP ranged from 31 to 8000 μm, and the reaction was incubated for 30 min. For determination of kcat, the concentration of ATP was 8.5 mm. 5-μl aliquots were removed and quenched with 5 μl of 0.1 m EDTA at 0, 7.5, 15, 30, and 45 min, respectively. For determination of Keff, the M13mp18 ssDNA concentration ranged from 0 to 10.6 nm, and the reaction was incubated for 30 min. The kinetic parameters were calculated by Enzyme Kinetics 1.3 (SigmaPlot, Systat Software Inc.) using the Michaelis-Menten equation. All experiments were repeated at least three times with S.D. indicated by error bars. Purified recombinant FANCJ protein (0.2 mg/ml, 0.5 ml) was applied to a 24-ml Superdex-200 size exclusion column (GE Healthcare) using an AKTA FPLC (GE Healthcare) that was equilibrated and eluted with 25 mm Tris·HCl (pH 7.5), 10% glycerol, 0.15 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm DTT. The column was run at a rate of 0.1 ml/min, and 0.5-ml fractions were collected. Proteins were detected using a UV detector. Protein concentration was determined by the Bradford method using BSA as standard in a 96-well plate. Enzymatic activity of the FANCJ protein was examined with the standard protocol as described above. The column was calibrated using standard molecular mass markers containing blue dextran (2000 kDa), thyroglobulin (670 kDa), alcohol dehydrogenase (150 kDa), albumin (66 kDa), carbonic anhydrase (29 kDa), and aprotinin (6.5 kDa) (Sigma). The Stokes radii of FANCJ-WT and FANCJ-Q25A were determined from their elution profile. The Kav for each protein was calculated from its elution profile and included and excluded volumes of the column. The Stokes radius of each protein was determined from a standard linear plot of log Stokes radius (RS) versus Kav using molecular weight markers. An aliquot (0.1 ml) of purified FANCJ protein (0.2 mg/ml) was layered onto a 5-ml 15–35% glycerol gradient in a buffer containing 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.2 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.2 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.2 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.1 μg/ml antipain, 1 mm pepstatin A, and 1 mm benzamidine. After centrifugation at 45,000 rpm for 18 h at 4 °C in a Beckman SW 50.1 rotor, four drops were collected from the bottom of the centrifugation tube. The distribution of FANCJ proteins was determined by 10% SDS-PAGE that was subjected to a Western blot assay using anti-FLAG antibody. The protein concentration of the FANCJ peaks was determined by the Bradford method using BSA as standard in a 96-well plate. Helicase and ATPase activity of protein were examined with the standard protocol as described above. Thyroglobulin (669 kDa), ferritin (440 kDa), and catalase (232 kDa) were used as protein molecular markers (GE Healthcare). Sedimentation values of proteins were determined as described previously. The apparent molecular weight was calculated using the Monty-Siegal equation: Mapp = 6 πηNas divided by (1 − νρ), where η = viscosity of the medium, N = Avogadro's number, a = Stokes radius, s = sedimentation coefficient, ν = partial specific volume, and ρ = density of the medium. The frictional ratio (f/f0), which estimates the deviation of the protein from a globular structure, was determined by the equation f/f0 = a/(3νM/4πN)1/3. HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and 1% l-glutamine at 37 °C in 5% CO2. For transient transfection, Lipofectamine2000 (Invitrogen) was used according provider's protocol, and cells were used 48 h after transfection. Chicken DT40 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum, 1% (v/v) chicken serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 50 μm 2-mercaptoethanol, 1% (v/v) penicillin/streptomycin in a 5% CO2 incubator at 41 °C.

https://openalex.org/W1978974591,"Magnetotactic bacteria (MTB) synthesize magnetosomes, which are intracellular vesicles comprising a magnetic particle. A series of magnetosomes arrange themselves in chains to form a magnetic dipole that enables the cell to orient itself along the Earth's magnetic field. MamK, an actin-like homolog of MreB has been identified as a central component in this organisation. Gene deletion, fluorescence microscopy and in vitro studies have yielded mechanistic differences in the filament assembly of MamK with other bacterial cytoskeletal proteins within the cell. With little or no information on the structural and behavioural characteristics of MamK outside the cell, the mamK gene from Magnetospirillium gryphiswaldense was cloned and expressed to better understand the differences in the cytoskeletal properties with its bacterial homologues MreB and acitin. Despite the low sequence identity shared between MamK and MreB (22%) and actin (18%), the behaviour of MamK monitored by light scattering broadly mirrored that of its bacterial cousin MreB primarily in terms of its pH, salt, divalent metal-ion and temperature dependency. The broad size variability of MamK filaments revealed by light scattering studies was supported by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) imaging. Filament morphology however, indicated that MamK conformed to linearly orientated filaments that appeared to be distinctly dissimilar compared to MreB suggesting functional differences between these homologues. The presence of a nucleotide binding domain common to actin-like proteins was demonstrated by its ability to function both as an ATPase and GTPase. Circular dichroism and structural homology modelling showed that MamK adopts a protein fold that is consistent with the 'classical' actin family architecture but with notable structural differences within the smaller domains, the active site region and the overall surface electrostatic potential."

The walls and ceiling of the room are painted with several human figures. Two walls also display a large number of delicate black, red, and incised hieroglyphs. Many of these hieroglyphs are calendrical in nature and relate astronomical computations, including at least two tables concerning the movement of the Moon, and perhaps Mars and Venus.

https://openalex.org/W2059084152,"The extracellular matrix protein biglycan (Bgn) is a leucine-rich proteoglycan that is involved in the matrix assembly, cellular migration and adhesion, cell growth, and apoptosis. Although a distinct expression of Bgn was found in a number of human tumors, the role of this protein in the initiation and/or maintenance of neoplastic transformation has not been studied in detail. Using an in vitro model of oncogenic transformation, a down-regulation of Bgn expression as well as an altered secretion of different Bgn isoforms was found both in murine and human HER-2/neu oncogene-transformed cells when compared with HER-2/neu(-) cells. This was associated with a reduced growth, wound closure, and migration capacity. Vice versa, silencing of Bgn in HER-2/neu(-) fibroblasts increased the growth rate and migration capacity of these cells. Bgn expression was neither modulated in HER-2/neu(+) cells by transforming growth factor-β(1) nor by inhibition of the phosphoinositol 3-kinase and MAP kinase pathways. In contrast, inhibition of the protein kinase C (PKC) pathway led to the reconstitution of Bgn expression. In particular, the PKC target protein cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) is a major regulator of Bgn expression as the silencing of CREB by RNA interference was accompanied by ∼5000-fold increase in Bgn-mRNA expression in HER-2/neu(+) cells. Thus, Bgn inhibits the major properties of HER-2/neu-transformed cells, which is inversely modulated by the PKC signaling cascade."

These lytic granules contain the pore-forming protein perforin and a set of five serine proteases called granzymes.

In the present study, we show that all human granzymes directly cleaved the DNA/RNA-binding protein heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K (hnRNP K), designating hnRNP K as the first known pan-granzyme substrate. Cleavage of hnRNP K was more efficient in the presence of RNA and occurred in two apparent proteolysis-sensitive amino acid regions, thereby dissecting the functional DNA/RNA-binding hnRNP K domains. HnRNP K was cleaved under physiological conditions when purified granzymes were delivered into living tumor cells and during lymphokine-activated killer cell-mediated attack. HnRNP K is essential for tumor cell viability, since knockdown of hnRNP K resulted in spontaneous tumor cell apoptosis with caspase activation and reactive oxygen species production. This apoptosis was more pronounced at low tumor cell density where hnRNP K knockdown also triggered a caspase-independent apoptotic pathway. This suggests that hnRNP K promotes tumor cell survival in the absence of cell-cell contact. Silencing of hnRNP K protein expression rendered tumor cells more susceptible to cellular cytotoxicity.

The major phenotypic landmark of exposure to low levels of T3 during development (hypothyroidism) in the cerebellum is the retarded inward migration of the most numerous cell type, granular neurons. In order to identify the direct genetic regulation exerted by T3 on cerebellar neurons and their precursors, we used microarray RNA hybridization to perform a time course analysis of T3 induced gene expression in primary cultures of cerebellar neuronal cell. These experiments suggest that we identified a small set of genes which are directly regulated, both in vivo and in vitro, during cerebellum post-natal development. These modest changes suggest that T3 does not acts directly on granular neurons and mainly indirectly influences the cellular interactions taking place during development."
https://openalex.org/W2059928376,"Enzymes secreted by Legionella pneumophila, such as phospholipases A (PLAs) and glycerophospholipid:cholesterol acyltransferases (GCATs), may target host cell lipids and therefore contribute to the establishment of Legionnaires disease. L. pneumophila possesses three proteins, PlaA, PlaC, and PlaD, belonging to the GDSL family of lipases/acyltransferases. We have shown previously that PlaC is the major GCAT secreted by L. pneumophila and that the zinc metalloproteinase ProA is essential for GCAT activity. Here we characterized the mode of PlaC GCAT activation and determined that ProA directly processes PlaC. We further found that not only cholesterol but also ergosterol present in protozoa was palmitoylated by PlaC. Such ester formations were not induced by either PlaA or PlaD. PlaD was shown here to possess lysophospholipase A activity, and interestingly, all three GDSL enzymes transferred short chain fatty acids to sterols. The three single putative catalytic amino acids (Ser-37, Asp-398, and His-401) proved essential for all PlaC-associated PLA, lysophospholipase A, and GCAT activities. A further four cysteine residues are important for the PLA/GCAT activities as well as their oxidized state, and we therefore conclude that PlaC likely forms at least one disulfide loop. Analysis of cleavage site and loop deletion mutants suggested that for GCAT activation deletion of several amino acids within the loop is necessary rather than cleavage at a single site. Our data therefore suggest a novel enzyme inhibition/activation mechanism where a disulfide loop inhibits PlaC GCAT activity until the protein is exported to the external space where it is ProA-activated."

LC-MS/MS analysis of PKCδ-activated intact hBVR identified phosphorylated serine positions 21, 33, 230, and 237, corresponding to the hBVR Src homology-2 domain motif (Ser(230) and Ser(237)), flanking the ATP-binding motif (Ser(21)) and in PHPS sequence (Ser(33)) as targets of PKCδ. Ser(21) and Ser(230) were also phosphorylated in hBVR-based peptides. The Ser(230)-containing peptide was a high affinity substrate for PKCδ in vitro and in cells; the relative affinity was PKCδ > PKCβII > PKCζ. Two overlapping peptides spanning this substrate, KRNRYLSF and SFHFKSGSL, were effective inhibitors of PKCδ kinase activity and PKCδ-supported activation of transcription factors Elk1 and NF-κB. Only SFHFKSGSL, in PKCδ-transfected phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-stimulated cells, caused membrane blebbing and cell loss. Biliverdin noncovalently inhibited PKCδ, whereas PKCδ potentiated hBVR reductase activity and accelerated the rate of bilirubin formation. This study, together with previous findings, reveals an unexpected regulatory interplay between PKCδ and hBVR in modulating cell death/survival in response to various activating stimuli. In addition, this study has identified novel substrates for and inhibitors of PKCδ. We suggest that hBVR-based technology may have utility to modulate PKCδ-mediated functions in the cell."

We previously established that the rate-limiting transition step occurs during the catalytic dwell at the initiation of the 120° rotation. Here, we use the phytopolyphenol, piceatannol, which binds to a pocket formed by contributions from α and β stator subunits and the carboxyl-terminal region of the rotor γ subunit. Piceatannol did not interfere with the movement through the 120° rotation step, but caused increased duration of the catalytic dwell. The duration time of the intrinsic inhibited state of F(1) also became significantly longer with piceatannol. All of the beads rotated at a lower rate in the presence of saturating piceatannol, indicating that the inhibitor stays bound throughout the rotational catalytic cycle. The Arrhenius plot of the temperature dependence of the reciprocal of the duration of the catalytic dwell (catalytic rate) indicated significantly increased activation energy of the rate-limiting step to trigger the 120° rotation. The activation energy was further increased by combination of piceatannol and substitution of γ subunit Met(23) with Lys, indicating that the inhibitor and the β/γ interface mutation affect the same transition step, even though they perturb physically separated rotor-stator interactions."

The PKC family of kinases can be divided into three subfamilies on the basis of their response to second messengers: conventional (cPKC) (α, βI, βII, and γ), novel (nPKC) (δ, ϵ, η, and θ), and atypical (ι/λ and ξ). In addition to regulation by intracellular second messengers, the maturation, stability, and activity of cPKC is regulated by three phosphorylation residues located in the activation loop, turn motif (TM) and hydrophobic motif (HM) (13.Parekh D.B. Ziegler W. Parker P.J. Multiple pathways control protein kinase C phosphorylation.EMBO J. 2000; 19: 496-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar).

Phosphorylation of serine 191 (Ser-191) in the C terminus of FADD has been proposed to be critical for its non-apoptotic function. Mice bearing the mutation mimicking constitutive phosphorylation (S191D) of FADD are immunologically compromised, similar to FADD-deficient mice (23.Hua Z.C. Sohn S.J. Kang C. Cado D. Winoto A.

The activation mechanisms of PKC are well documented, but the molecular mechanisms of PKC inactivation are less well understood. Dephosphorylation of TM and HM are critical for the inactivation and degradation of PKC α and βII (29.Hansra G. Bornancin F. Whelan R.

A recent report showed that PH domain and Leucine rich repeat Protein Phosphatases (PHLPP), a novel Ser/Thr phosphatase, can destabilize cellular PKCα and βII by dephosphorylating the HM of PKC (36.Gao T.

Here, we report that FADD is required for the PP2A catalytic subunit to recruit cPKC. In the absence of FADD, endogenous PKCα no longer interacted with PP2Ac, so was not dephosphorylated and resistant to degradation. More interestingly, the S191D mutation abolished the ability of FADD to promote PP2Ac recruiting PKCβII and promoted the resistance of PKCα and PKCβII to degradation. Both FADD deficiency and the S191D mutant enhanced cPKC phosphorylation, stability, and signaling. Moreover, up-regulated cPKC signaling promoted cytoskeleton remodeling and cell motility. Collectively, these findings suggest that FADD could regulate cPKC dephosphorylation and signaling termination.

For preparation of soluble and insoluble fractions, the cells was lysed in lysis buffer and centrifuged (15,000 × g, 10 min, 4 °C), and the supernatant was used as soluble fraction. The pellet was sonicated with 1× sample buffer and used as in soluble fraction. All the immunoblotting experiments were repeated three to five times. One representative result for each experiment is shown. 293T and MEFs were cultured in DMEM (Hyclone) containing 10% FBS (Hyclone) with 50 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin. FADD mutant cell lines, FADD-A and FADD-D, were constructed on the basis of FADD−/− MEFs. The construction and validation of all cell lines were performed in the laboratory of Dr. Astar Winoto (University of California, Berkeley). Briefly, FADD-A and FADD-D mutant cDNAs were generated using PCR, as described previously (23.Hua Z.C. Sohn S.J. Kang C. Cado D. Winoto A.

Supernatant was used to infect FADD KO MEFs. Infected MEFs were selected with Zeocin for 1 month. The expression level of FADD and FADD mutants was examined using Western blot analyses and was similar across different MEFs. The FADD phosphorylation mutant mice (FADD-D in FADD−/− alleles) were generated as reported previously (23.Hua Z.C. Sohn S.J. Kang C. Cado D. Winoto A. A function of Fas-associated death domain protein in cell cycle progression localized to a single amino acid at its C-terminal region.Immunity. 2003; 18: 513-521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Briefly, the FADD-D transgenic mice were generated and then mated to FADD+/− mice for at least two generations to obtain mice that express only FADD-D (with FADD−/− alleles). The mice were housed in an Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care Jiangsu Province-accredited specific pathogen free (SPF) animal facility in Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital, and all animal protocols were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of the School of Life Sciences of Nanjing University. Muscular tissues were homogenized in a lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 250 mm NaCl, 0.5%Triton X-100, 50 mm NaF, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, and protein inhibitor mixture and immunoprecipitated with anti-PKCβII antibody and protein G-agarose (Millipore). MEFs were directly lysed in the lysis buffer. The immunoprecipitates were washed six times with lysis buffer and subjected to Western blot analysis. Cells were lysed in lysis buffer without NaF and Na3VO4 and centrifuged for 20 min at 13,000 × g. PP2Ac was immunoprecipitated, and the activity was measured with the PP2A immunoprecipitation phosphatase assay kit (Millipore). After the indicated treatments, cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde for 1 h, penetrated with 0.5% Triton X-100 for 1 h, and then stained with Texas Red-X phalloidin for 1 h. F-actin was then visualized by microscopy (Carl Zeiss, Axioplan 2). For the wound closure assay, confluent cell monolayers were cultured in serum-free DMEM for 24 h and scraped manually with a pipette tip. The culture medium was replaced with fresh medium containing PMA or FBS. The transwell migration assay was performed using an 8-μm PET 24-well Millicell culture insert with hanging geometry (Millipore). Cells were cultured in serum-free medium overnight and treated with inhibitor for 2 h before trypsinization. 100-μl single-cell suspension at the concentration of 106 cells/ml was added to the inner side of the transwell. After 5 h, cells on the inner side of the membrane were wiped clean with a cotton swab. Cells on the outer side were fixed with 4% formaldehyde prior to staining with crystal violet. Images were captured with a ×10 objective lens. The average number of migrated cells in five to six randomly chosen fields of view per insert was taken to quantify the extent of migration. For the chemotaxis assay, splenocytes or mesenteric lymphocytes were isolated and cultured in serum-free medium for 2 h. A single-cell suspension was used for the transwell assay. After stimulation with SDF-1 or FBS, migrated cells were quantified using a QCMTM Chemotaxis cell migration assay (Millipore). To study the effects of FADD on PKC, we examined FADD-deficient murine embryonic fibroblast cells (FADD−/− MEFs). Interestingly, we found that protein levels of all cPKCs and one nPKC, PKCδ, were increased in FADD−/− MEFs as compared with FADD+/+ MEFs (Fig. 1A). In contrast, the protein levels of other nPKCs, such as PKCϵ, and atypical PKCs, such as PKCξ, in FADD−/− MEFs were similar to levels in FADD+/+ MEFs (Fig. 1A). To examine whether the accumulation of cPKC and nPKC in FADD−/− MEFs might be attributable to increased stability, we treated cells with PMA in a long-term manner (12 h) with lower and milder concentrations that induced endogenous PKCs degradation. Compared with that of FADD+/+ MEFs, PKCα degradation was greatly reduced in FADD−/− MEFs upon PMA treatment (Fig. 1B). Likewise, the degradation of both PKCβII and PKCγ was also decreased in FADD−/− MEFs (Fig. 1B and data not shown). In contrast to cPKC, the degradation of PKCδ was reduced only at low PMA concentrations (Fig. 1B). On the other hand, the rate of degradation of the nPKC PKCϵ was comparable between FADD+/+ and FADD−/− MEFs (Fig. 1B). Interestingly, we found that the protein levels of FADD are induced in response to PMA treatment in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1B). Because cPKCs such as PKCα and PKCβ are most affected by FADD deficiency, we concentrated our subsequent analysis of PKCα and PKCβ. We found that levels of both PKCα and PKCβ mRNA were comparable between FADD+/+ and FADD−/− MEFs after PMA stimulation (data not shown). Although inhibiting de novo protein synthesis with CHX significantly promotes the loss of PKCα in FADD+/+ MEFs in response to PMA, CHX had no significant effect on accumulated PKCα in FADD−/− MEFs (Fig. 1C). These data suggest that FADD is involved in posttranslational regulation of cPKC. To confirm that the increased PKCα protein levels was a consequence of FADD deletion, we reintroduced a FADD expression plasmid into FADD−/− MEFs. Re-expression of FADD restored the PMA-induced PKCα degradation in FADD−/− MEFs (Fig. S1). Previous studies have indicated that both TM and HM phosphorylation of PKCα/β are important for protein stability (29.Hansra G. Bornancin F. Whelan R.

Poised to signal.Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2010; 298: E395-E402Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). Therefore, we analyzed TM and HM phosphorylation of cPKC in FADD−/− MEFs. Consistent with the elevated protein level, phospho-TM and phospho-HM of PKCα/β were significantly higher in FADD−/− MEFs than in FADD+/+ MEFs (Fig. 1B). To differentiate the effect of FADD deficiency on the levels of PKCα protein versus that of phosphorylation, we treated cells with PMA in a short-term manner (3 h) with higher concentrations (500 ng/ml and 1000 ng/ml) to induce rapid phosphorylation loss without affecting protein level. Strikingly, TM dephosphorylation of PKCα/β was largely inhibited in FADD−/− MEFs, whereas HM dephosphorylation was comparable (Fig. 2A). These data suggest that FADD is required for TM dephosphorylation of PKCα/β but less important for HM dephosphorylation. mTORC2 has been shown to be required for cPKC TM and HM phosphorylation (17.Ikenoue T.

The mammalian target of rapamycin complex 2 controls folding and stability of Akt and protein kinase C.EMBO J. 2008; 27: 1932-1943Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). Therefore, we evaluated whether TORC2 contributes to the increased TM and HM phosphorylation in FADD−/− MEFs. This is similar to other reports (17.Ikenoue T. Inoki K. Yang Q. Zhou X. Guan K.L. Essential function of TORC2 in PKC and Akt turn motif phosphorylation, maturation and signalling.EMBO J. 2008; 27: 1919-1931Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar, 18.Facchinetti V. Ouyang W.

The mammalian target of rapamycin complex 2 controls folding and stability of Akt and protein kinase C.EMBO J. 2008; 27: 1932-1943Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar), although inhibition of mTORC2 by prolonged rapamycin treatment showed an insignificant effect on total cPKC protein level. Indeed, it reduced TM and HM phosphorylation in FADD+/+ MEFs (Fig. 2B). In contrast, rapamycin had no effect on TM and HM phosphorylation in FADD−/− MEFs (Fig. 2B). In addition, heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) has been reported to protect dephosphorylated PKCα from degradation (39.Gao T. Newton A.C. The turn motif is a phosphorylation switch that regulates the binding of Hsp70 to protein kinase C.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31585-31592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The HSP90 inhibitor 17-AAG promoted TM and HM dephosphorylation in FADD+/+ MEFs, whereas it had no significant effects on phospho-TM and phospho-HM in FADD−/− MEFs (Fig. 2B). These experiments suggest that the persistent phosphorylation of cPKCs in FADD−/− MEFs is not due to increased phosphorylation. To confirm the specific effects of FADD deletion on TM and HM phosphorylation in FADD−/− MEFs, we reintroduced a FADD plasmid into FADD−/− MEFs. Consistent with the abovementioned observations, restoration of FADD expression reduced PKCα protein levels. Furthermore, FADD expression reduced TM phosphorylation upon PMA treatment. Similarly, HM phosphorylation was also decreased in FADD-complemented FADD−/− MEFs (Fig. 2C). Phosphorylation of cPKC is known to provide resistance to degradation (40.Gould C.M. Newton A.C. The life and death of protein kinase C.Curr. Drug Targets. 2008; 9: 614-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Because cPKC is highly phosphorylated in FADD−/− MEFs, we explored whether the accumulated cPKC was due to increased protein stability in FADD−/− MEFs. We treated cells with CHX to monitor PKCα degradation. CHX reduced PKCα protein levels in FADD+/+ MEFs but had no significant effect on accumulated PKCα in FADD−/− MEFs (Fig. 3A). This result indicates that endogenous PKCα is resistant to degradation in the absence of FADD. It has been well established that mature PKCα is phosphorylated constitutively, stable, and localized in the detergent-soluble compartment. Upon dephosphorylation, PKCα became detergent-insoluble (36.Gao T. Brognard J. Newton A.C. The phosphatase PHLPP controls the cellular levels of protein kinase C.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 6300-6311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Most of the accumulated endogenous PKCα was present in the detergent-soluble supernatant, consistent with the highly phosphorylated status of PKCα in FADD−/− MEFs (Fig. 3B). We then determined the effect of FADD on the stability of the TM and HM phosphorylation mutants. We transfected wild-type PKCβII (WT), the TM mutation (PKCβII-T634A/T638A/T641A), and the HM mutation (PKCβII-S660A) into 293T cells in the absence or presence of FLAG-FADD. Consistent with previous studies (17.Ikenoue T. Inoki K. Yang Q. Zhou X. Guan K.L.

Immunostaining revealed that PPA is located at the brush-border membrane (BBM) of enterocytes in the duodenum and that the binding is inhibited by mannan but not galactan, indicating that PPA binds carbohydrate-specifically to BBM. The ligands for PPA in BBM were identified as glycoprotein N-glycans that are significantly involved in the assimilation of glucose, including sucrase-isomaltase (SI) and Na(+)/Glc cotransporter 1 (SGLT1). Binding of SI and SGLT1 in BBM to PPA was dose-dependent and inhibited by mannan. Using BBM vesicles, we found functional changes in PPA and its ligands in BBM due to the N-glycan-specific interaction. The starch-degrading activity of PPA and maltose-degrading activity of SI were enhanced to 240 and 175%, respectively, while Glc uptake by SGLT1 was markedly inhibited by PPA at high but physiologically possible concentrations, and the binding was attenuated by the addition of mannose-specific lectins, especially from Galanthus nivalis. Additionally, recombinant human pancreatic α-amylases expressed in yeast and purified by single-step affinity chromatography exhibited the same carbohydrate binding specificity as PPA in binding assays with sugar-biotinyl polymer probes. The results indicate that mammalian pancreatic α-amylases share a common carbohydrate binding activity and specifically bind to the intestinal BBM. Interaction with N-glycans in the BBM activated PPA and SI to produce much Glc on the one hand and to inhibit Glc absorption by enterocytes via SGLT1 in order to prevent a rapid increase in blood sugar on the other."

Conclusion: Agrobacterial protelomerase is the most compact enzyme of its kind that can uniquely both form and bind hairpin telomeres. Significance: The studies of the reaction mechanism is crucial in understanding why and how and the prevalence of the existence of linear chromosome in bacteria. Bacterial chromosomes and plasmids are usually circular. In some cases, linear chromosomes or linear plasmids with either covalent protein-bound or closed hairpin ends are stably maintained as an alternative genome configuration. To date, the bacteria known to harbor hairpin-ended linear chromosomes include only the large chromosome of all studied Borrelia species and one of the two chromosomes of Agrobacterium tumefaciens C58. Borrelia species cause diseases in mammals, including Lyme disease and relapsing fever in humans, and are unique among spirochetes in their chromosome architecture (1.Casjens S. Murphy M. DeLange M. Sampson L. van Vugt R. Huang W.M. Telomeres of the linear chromosomes of Lyme disease spirochaetes. Nucleotide sequence and possible exchange with linear plasmid telomeres.Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 26: 581-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Many strains of the genus Agrobacterium within the α-Proteobacteria cause the tumorous crown gall disease on a variety of plants and have been manipulated into an important tool for the genetic engineering of plants. Linear plasmids are somewhat more widely distributed. Borrelia spirochetes harbor, in addition to their linear chromosome, numerous linear and circular plasmids (2.Casjens S. Palmer N. van Vugt R. Huang W.M. Stevenson B. Rosa P. Lathigra R. Sutton G. Peterson J. Dodson R.J. Haft D. Hickey E. Gwinn M. White O. Fraser C.M. A bacterial genome in flux.

Microbiol. 2000; 35: 490-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in the γ-Proteobacteria, three linear hairpin-ended plasmid systems have been characterized as follows: the N15 of Escherichia coli, the φKO2 of Klebsiella oxytoca, and the PY54 of Yersinia enterocolitica (3.Casjens S.R.

Ford M.E. Hatfull G.F. Hendrix R.W. Genomic sequence and analysis of the atypical temperate bacteriophage N15.J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 53-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). These linear plasmids are the nonintegrated prophages of the corresponding bacteriophages. The phage enzymes responsible for generating closed hairpin-ended plasmids are called protelomerases (6.Rybchin V.N. Svarchevsky A.N. The plasmid prophage N15. A linear DNA with covalently closed ends.Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 33: 895-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The protelomerases from phages φKO2 and N15 have been extensively characterized biochemically. They use a topoisomerase IB and tyrosine recombinase (Y-recombinase) type of cutting-and-rejoining mechanism to generate DNA hairpin ends at a specific DNA site called tel (7.Huang W.M. Joss L. Hsieh T. Casjens S. Protelomerase uses a topoisomerase IB/Y-recombinase type mechanism to generate DNA hairpin ends.J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 337: 77-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Further examination of the mechanism showed that the protelomerases generate a pair of transient staggered cleavages 6 bp apart on the two strands of their specific target DNA sequence to form a 3′-covalent DNA-protein intermediate and a 5′-OH at each opening. After exchange of strand partners, the cleaved openings are re-ligated to generated closed hairpin ends as a result of two transesterification reactions. Although these enzymes use a tyrosine as the active site residue, they form a subfamily of Y-recombinases in that they act on a single duplex DNA site, rather than two target sites that are typically utilized by the canonical Y-recombinases to effect DNA insertion or excision (i.e. typical Y-recombinases do not make double strand cuts on one target site, whereas protelomerases make double-stranded staggered cuts on the target DNA). Protelomerases are simple enzymes that utilize sequence-specific target sites without the need for cofactors (7.Huang W.M. Joss L. Hsieh T. Casjens S. Protelomerase uses a topoisomerase IB/Y-recombinase type mechanism to generate DNA hairpin ends.J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 337: 77-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The protein responsible for generating the hairpin ends in the Borrelia burgdorferi linear plasmids has also been characterized. Like the phage enzymes, it generates a pair of 6-bp staggered cuts with 5′-protrusions and protein-linked intermediates at each of the openings that have 3′-phosphoryl-covalent attachment to the active site tyrosine and free 5′-OH (8.Chaconas G.

ResT, a telomere resolvase encoded by the Lyme disease spirochete.Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 195-201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the responsible protein, called ResT, is encoded on a circular plasmid of the bacteria (2.Casjens S. Palmer N. van Vugt R. Huang W.M. Stevenson B. Rosa P. Lathigra R. Sutton G. Peterson J. Dodson R.J. Haft D. Hickey E. Gwinn M. White O. Fraser C.M. A bacterial genome in flux.

Microbiol. 2000; 35: 490-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar). Whether the linear plasmids found in Borrelia had their origin in phages is unknown. In addition to the above mentioned closed hairpin end generating systems of linear plasmids, protelomerase-like genes have also been identified based on amino acid sequence alignments in a number of marine Vibrio phages, including those from Vibrio harveyi phage VHML (10.Oakey H.J.

Furthermore, protelomerase-like proteins harboring the signature amino acids have also been identified in the two sequenced eukaryotic filamentous brown algal viruses Ectocarpus siliculosus EsV-1 and the Feldmannia irregularis FirrV (14.Delaroque N.

Schroeder D.C. Allen M.J. Holden M.T. Parkhill J. Barrell B.G. Churcher C. Hamlin N. Mungall K. Norbertczak H. Quail M.A. Price C. Rabbinowitsch E. Walker D. Craigon M. Roy D. Ghazal P. Complete genome sequence and lytic phase transcription profile of a Coccolithovirus.Science. 2005; 309: 1090-1092Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Whether these phages and viruses exist intracellularly as linear plasmids in the infected cells remains to be further explored. Nonetheless, this suggests that this new class of enzymes may have a wider distribution than previously recognized and may even be present in eukaryotes. As a first step toward understanding the physiological significance of having closed linear chromosomes, we sought to examine the linear chromosome-generating system in A. tumefaciens C58. The type strain C58 (a representative of biovar 1 of the genus Agrobacterium (17.Allardet-Servent A. Michaux-Charachon S. Jumas-Bilak E. Karayan L. Ramuz M. Presence of one linear and one circular chromosome in the Agrobacterium tumefaciens C58 genome.J. Bacterial. 1993; 175: 7869-7874Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)) is genetically tractable and has one circular and one linear chromosome but no linear plasmids (it does have the two circular T-plasmids that are responsible for the pathogenicity of the bacteria). The terminal fragments of the linear chromosome have rapid snapback properties upon heat denaturation (18.Goodner B. Hinkle G. Gattung S. Miller N. Blanchard M. Qurollo B. Goldman B.S. Cao Y. Askenazi M. Halling C. Mullin L. Houmiel K. Gordon J. Vaudin M. Iartchouk O. Epp A. Liu F. Wollam C. Allinger M. Doughty D. Scott C. Lappas C. Markelz B. Flanagan C. Crowell C. Gurson J. Lomo C.

Genome sequence of the plant pathogen and biotechnology agent Agrobacterium tumefaciens C58.Science. 2001; 294: 2323-2328Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). This observation strongly suggests that the linear chromosomal ends are closed hairpins, similar to those described above. A. tumefaciens C58 must therefore maintain both circular and linear chromosome resolving machineries. Amino acid similarity searches based on the phage-encoded protelomerase enzymes identified open reading frame Atu2523 on the circular chromosome from the two published sequences (18.Goodner B.

The genome of the natural genetic engineer Agrobacterium tumefaciens C58.Science. 2001; 294: 2317-2323Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar); the nucleotide differences in the two published sequences have since been resolved and consolidated and are jointly listed under GenBankTM accession number AE008686. In the Borrelia system, which harbors a single linear chromosome and numerous smaller linear plasmids, the unique single copy gene for the protelomerase/resolving enzyme that is used to generate these different but related linear ends must possess somewhat relaxed nucleotide specificity (1.Casjens S. Murphy M. DeLange M. Sampson L. van Vugt R. Huang W.M. Telomeres of the linear chromosomes of Lyme disease spirochaetes. Nucleotide sequence and possible exchange with linear plasmid telomeres.Mol.

Microbiol. 2000; 35: 490-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar); however, the agrobacterial enzyme presumably has a more stringent specificity in its DNA target recognition because it acts exclusively on the two ends of its only linear chromosome, and no linear plasmids were found in the Agrobacterium genome. It should be noted that in systems where the linear plasmids exist as nonintegrated prophages, the target site for the phage protelomerase is invariably located upstream of the encoded gene as a full target of inverted repeat sequences. As such, the duplex target site is readily obtainable as the joined ends of the linear plasmid that reside in the interior of the phage genome. However, in linear replicons that are not phage-associated, such as the bacterial linear chromosome, the hairpin ends constitute only half of a target site. In this report, we complete the determination of the sequences of the linear chromosome to its telomeres and provide biochemical evidence that the protein encoded by Atu2523 is the agrobacterial protelomerase capable of generating closed hairpin ends identical to those of the linear chromosome of the organism. We also characterize the requirements of the enzyme and the minimal target site of the hairpin end generating system. Our results show that the Agrobacterium protelomerase also generates a pair of 6-bp staggered cleavages as an intermediate in the reaction confirming the universality of this reaction mechanism and that the Agrobacterium enzyme uniquely binds to and hence likely protects the hairpin ends. Open reading frame Atu2523 was cloned into pET15b (Novagen) via the NdeI and BamHI sites in the T7 promoter-driven system to express the N-terminal His-tagged full-length TelA protein. The coding sequence was amplified by PCR using the following primer pair: AG-1 (5′-GAGCCGCCATATGCTCGCCGCAAAACGAAAAACAA-3′) as upstream primer and AG-2 (5′-AGAGGATCCTTATCCCTTGCGGGACACGGGCGCGATCG-3′) as downstream primer, where the underlined nucleotides are the restriction sites used for cloning. The N-terminal deletion protein TelA-N11 was similarly constructed as the full-length protein, except primer AG-3 (5′-ACAAAACATATGGTCCTCGTGGAACGCATCGATCA-3′)that starts the coding information beyond the NdeI site from residue 12 was used as the upstream primer. Subsequent systematic N-terminal deletions were constructed using a similar scheme of using as the first amino acid a residue beyond the intended truncation as the upstream primer, and again coupled with AG-2 as the downstream primer in the PCR amplification reaction for the construction. The C-terminal deletion TelA-C was constructed using primer AG-1 with primer AG-4 (5′-CGCAAGCTTTTACATTTGCTGCAATGTCCGCTCATTGG-3′), which ends at residue 432 of the coding sequence. In the latter case, the NdeI and HindIII cloning sites of pET15b were used. Mutant protein TelA/Y405F was constructed using a 34-mer complementary primer pair 5′-TCGAAACGTCGCTGTCCTTTATGACCTATACGCT-3′ and 5′-AGCGTATAGGTCATAAAGGACAGCGACGTTTCGA-3′ carrying a Tyr to Phe substitution at residue 405 (the codon for the substituted residue is underlined), using the QuikChange II site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instruction. Similar site-directed mutagenesis was used to generate substitution mutants in the catalytic regions of the TelA proteins, namely R255A, K286N, Y363E, R366A, and H394A. The 50-bp synthetic target site and its truncation variants (described in Fig. 2) were cloned into a pSK plasmid (Stratagene) via HindIII and BamHI sites using synthetic oligonucleotides harboring the described sequences with the added restriction sites for cloning purposes. Similarly, substrate deletions (described in Fig. 4) as well as other substrate variants were constructed using symmetrically shorter oligonucleotide pairs or variant oligonucleotide pairs as target for the insertion into the pSK plasmid (Stratagene). All plasmid constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing.FIGURE 4Minimal DNA target size of TelA. A series of plasmids with symmetrical deletions in the 50-bp DNA target site used in Fig. 2 was generated to test their ability to serve as substrates for TelA. In each case, the central 6 bp (TCATGA) where the hairpin is formed was maintained, and 2 to 3 outside nucleotides were successively deleted from the dyad symmetrical target sequences to generate eight substrates, which were then linearized by AlwNI before use. The products were analyzed on 1% agarose electrophoresis gel. In the sequence depicted below the gel, the central 6 bp are boxed, two pairs of arrows indicate the two nested inverted repeats, and the lowercase nucleotides (represented as XXX in the diagram) indicate where dyad symmetry is not maintained.

Size fractions containing the 2-kbp NdeI fragment and a 1.8-kbp MluI fragment were isolated from agarose gels. The partially purified fragments were treated with S1 nuclease (room temperature, 5 min according to the manufacturer's instruction) and ligated with T4 ligase to a duplex linker that was formed by a pair of complementary synthetic oligonucleotides (5′-phosphorylated LK1, 22-mer, 5′-P-CCCTATAGTGAGTCGTATTACG-3′ and LK-2, 20-mer, 5′-TAATACGACTCACTATAGGG-3′). The duplex-linker thus formed has a blunt 5′-end and a 2-bp 3′-protrusion (underlined in the LK-1 sequence). This design ensured that the blunt end of the duplex linker was uniquely ligated to the blunt end generated by the S1 nuclease in the end fragments and not ligated to other linkers. The ligated products were then used as template for PCRs. For the right-end NdeI fragment, a 5′ upstream primer (5′-TTTTGTGCAGCTTTTGATAGG-3′, designed from the known linear chromosome sequence) and LK-2 oligonucleotide serving as 3′ primer generated a PCR fragment of about 500 bp. Similarly, using the left-end MluI fragment, an upstream primer (5′-GGAAAGGTGTGTTCAAATGG-3′) and the LK-2 oligonucleotide generated a PCR fragment of 550 bp. These PCR fragments were directly inserted into the pCR-4-TOPO cloning system (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The resulting plasmid clones were sequenced using vector-derived primers to sequence across the entire inserts. The inserted sequences were compiled and compared with the published linear chromosome sequence. Agrobacterium protelomerase (TelA) was purified as an N-terminal His6 fusion protein from E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells (Novagen) harboring the expression plasmid pET/TelA essentially as described previously for the purification of protelomerase from φKO2 (7.Huang W.M. Joss L. Hsieh T. Casjens S. Protelomerase uses a topoisomerase IB/Y-recombinase type mechanism to generate DNA hairpin ends.J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 337: 77-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In brief, cultures were grown in LB medium (5 g of NaCl, 10 g of bacto-tryptone, 5 g of yeast extract/liter) supplemented with 130 μg ml−1 ampicillin at 37 °C until the A590 reached about 0.8. Induction with isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was done at 0.8 mm at room temperature for 15 h. Cells from the induced culture were harvested by centrifugation and stored frozen at −80 °C until use. Cells expressing TelA (or its derivatives) were lysed by lysozyme (Sigma, used at 0.6 mg ml−1) and briefly sonicated in the presence of 25% sucrose, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 25 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and protease inhibitors 0.13 mm benzamidine and 0.6 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF). The crude extract was further treated with 150 μg ml−1 RNase and 5 μg ml−1 DNase, in 5 mm Mg2SO4 at 0 °C for 1 h, and finally made into 2 m NaCl and 0.6% Thesit (Roche Applied Science) to complete the extraction. Soluble protein, as supernatant after centrifugation at 25,000 rpm at 4 °C in an SW40 rotor (Beckman Coulter), was loaded onto a 15-ml column of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) equilibrated with buffer N (10% glycerol, 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mm benzamidine). The column was washed extensively with buffer N containing 0.5 m NaCl, and the protein was eluted with buffer N plus 0.5 m NaCl and 0.8 m imidazole. Fractions containing TelA were pooled and dialyzed against buffer N containing 0.5 m NaCl to remove imidazole and eventually dialyzed against buffer S (50% glycerol, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 m NaCl, 15 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 0.1 mm benzamidine) and 0.5 mm PMSF for storage at −20 °C. Aliquots of about 10 mg were further purified by gel filtration on a Superdex 200 column (HiLoad 16/60, GE Healthcare) using FPLC at a flow rate of 1 ml min−1 in buffer N containing 0.5 m NaCl. Protelomerase was assayed in 15-μl reactions containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm potassium glutamate, 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mg of supercoiled or linearized plasmid substrate DNA, and 0.2–2 pmol of enzyme. Reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 30 min and stopped by the addition of SDS to 1% final concentration. Products were analyzed on 1% agarose electrophoresis gels and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. When oligonucleotides were used as substrates, the same reaction conditions were used except the substrate concentration was present at 15 pmol per reaction, and the enzyme concentration was increased to 40–100 pmol per reaction. Oligonucleotide reaction products were analyzed on 12% polyacrylamide gels using a vertical gel electrophoresis system. These substrates were prepared by mixing complementary synthetic oligonucleotides at 10 pmol ml−1 in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 5 mm MgCl2. The mixture was first heated to 90 °C for 3 min followed by slow cooling at 0.01 °C/s in a thermal cycler that allowed controlled annealing to form duplexes. When appropriate, oligonucleotides were labeled at the 5′-end with T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs) and [γ-32P]ATP before annealing to provide a marker for the products. To prepare a duplex oligonucleotide substrate with an internal phosphate label, we used two halves of one strand of the full-length substrate, with the 5′-end of the designated internal break being first labeled with 32P. The two halves were then mixed with their complementary full-length oligonucleotide to form a duplex with an internal break. The annealed products were then ligated with T4 DNA ligase to reconstitute the full-length duplex oligonucleotide substrate, and an internal 32P was thus incorporated at the designated position. We define nucleotide numbering from left to right regardless of whether it is the top or bottom strand (as shown in Fig. 3), and because polynucleotide kinase adds a phosphate exclusively to the 5′-end of an oligonucleotide, the 3′ or 5′ orientation of the labeled internal phosphate at the top strand is different from that of the bottom strand. For example, to form substrate with label at 22T on the top strand, the two halves of the top strand consist of oligonucleotide 1–22 and oligonucleotide 23–60. The 5′-32P-phosphate was added to oligonucleotide 23–60. Thus, the 32P of 22T is added at the 3′-side of nucleotide number 22T. In contrast, when the bottom strand was internally labeled, the 32P was added at the 5′-side of the designated nucleotide. For example, in forming 28B substrate, the two halves of the bottom strand are formed by oligonucleotides 1–28 and 29–60 (numbering is again from left to right). The 5′-32P is added to the 5′-side of the left oligonucleotide 1–28 on the bottom strand before ligation to reconstitute the duplex substrate; hence, the 32P in this case was at the 5′-side of nucleotide 28B. The relevant phosphates are shown in Fig. 3A for clarity. Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry analysis was done at the University of Utah Core Facilities. Neutral agarose gel (1%) was carried out in TAE buffer, pH 8.2 (40 mm Tris-base, 5 mm sodium acetate, 2 mm EDTA-Na2). Alkaline agarose gel (1%) was carried out in 50 mm NaOH and 1 mm EDTA running at 40 V for 4 h at 4 °C. Reaction products using oligonucleotide as substrates were analyzed in 12% polyacrylamide gel running in TBE buffer pH 8.5 (0.135 m Tris-base, 45 mm boric acid, and 2.5 mm EDTA-Na2). The two published genomic sequences of A. tumefaciens C58 did not reach the telomeric ends of the linear chromosome, as the closed terminal fragments are expected to be absent from the collection of clones used in the sequencing projects. This is because the closed ends at the termini are not free to ligate to the vector during the library construction; hence, their sequences are excluded from the conventional genomic sequence. We set out to specifically determine the terminal sequences of the linear chromosome using a different strategy by first identifying the two terminal fragments of the linear chromosome and then opening the closed ends by single strand-specific nucleases, thereby making them accessible to ligation. This approach has been used successfully to determine the telomeres of the B. burgdorferi linear chromosome and some linear plasmids (1.Casjens S. Murphy M. DeLange M. Sampson L. van Vugt R.

These fragments were isolated from the total genomic DNA digests from agarose electrophoresis gels, followed by S1 nuclease treatment to nick open the hairpin ends, and these converted open ends were then blunt end-ligated to a double-stranded synthetic oligonucleotide linker. Using upstream genome sequence and the linker sequence as PCR primer targets, the end fragments were amplified and cloned into the pCR4-TOPO vector (Invitrogen) and sequenced (see under “Experimental Procedures” for details). We sequenced six clones from each of the NdeI and MluI fragment inserts, and the sequences were in perfect agreement with the published sequences where they overlapped and were followed by the extending new sequences, and the position of the linker sequence identified the tip of the linear chromosome. When the targeted independently determined right and left telomeric sequences reported here were compared with the published genomic sequences, we found that the University of Washington sequence (accession number AE008686 (19.Wood D.W.

LFP spatiotemporal features are particularly relevant in view of their applications both in research (e.g. for understanding brain rhythms, inter-areal neural communication and neuronal coding) and in the clinics (e.g. for improving invasive Brain-Machine Interface devices). However the relation between LFPs and spikes is complex and not fully understood. As spikes represent the fundamental currency of neuronal communication this gap in knowledge strongly limits our comprehension of neuronal phenomena underlying LFPs. We investigated the LFP-spike relation during tactile stimulation in primary somatosensory (S-I) cortex in the rat. First we quantified how reliably LFPs and spikes code for a stimulus occurrence. Then we used the information obtained from our analyses to design a predictive model for spike occurrence based on LFP inputs. The model was endowed with a flexible meta-structure whose exact form, both in parameters and structure, was estimated by using a multi-objective optimization strategy. Our method provided a set of nonlinear simple equations that maximized the match between models and true neurons in terms of spike timings and Peri Stimulus Time Histograms. We found that both LFPs and spikes can code for stimulus occurrence with millisecond precision, showing, however, high variability. Spike patterns were predicted significantly above chance for 75% of the neurons analysed. Crucially, the level of prediction accuracy depended on the reliability in coding for the stimulus occurrence. The best predictions were obtained when both spikes and LFPs were highly responsive to the stimuli. Spike reliability is known to depend on neuron intrinsic properties (i.e. on channel noise) and on spontaneous local network fluctuations. Our results suggest that the latter, measured through the LFP response variability, play a dominant role."
https://openalex.org/W2021353002,"Purpose To assess longitudinal changes in parapapillary atrophy in the adult population of Greater Beijing. Methods The population-based Beijing Eye Study 2006 included 3251 subjects who had participated in the Beijing Eye Study 2001 and returned for re-examination. The mean age was 60.4±10.1 years. Using optic disc photographs, we measured parapapillary atrophy which was divided into alpha zone and beta zone. Results Overall progression rate of alpha zone was seen in 0.6±0.1% (95% confidence interval (CI):0.3,0.9) of the subjects and of beta zone in 8.2±0.5% (95%CI:7.2,9.1) of the subjects. In binary regression analysis, rate of progression of alpha zone was significantly associated higher age (P = 0.04) and the co-progression of zone Beta (P<0.001). Rate of progression of beta zone was significantly associated with higher age (P<0.001; odds ratio (OR):1.11;95%CI:1.10,1.14), higher intraocular pressure (P<0.001;OR:1.10;95%CI:1.05,1.14), higher myopic refractive error (P<0.001;OR:0.71; 95%CI:0.67,0.75), rural region of habitation (P = 0.002;OR: 0.58; 95%CI:0.41,0.82), presence of glaucomatous optic nerve damage (P<0.001;OR:2.89; 95%CI:1.62,5.14), co-progression of alpha zone (P<0.001;OR:7.13;95%CI:2.43,20.9), absence of arterial hypertension (P = 0.03;OR: 0.70; 95%CI:0.51,0.96), and thicker central corneal thickness (P = 0.02;OR:1.01;95%CI:1.00,1.01). Subjects with a non-glaucomatous optic nerve damage (n = 22) as compared to the remaining subjects did not vary in the progression rate of alpha zone (0.0% versus 0.6±0.1%; P = 1.0) and beta zone (8.2±0.5% versus 6.3±0.6%;P = 1.0). Conclusions In adult Chinese in Greater Beijing, the 5-year progression rate of beta zone of parapapillary atrophy (seen in 8.2±0.5% of subjects) was significantly correlated with higher age, rural region of habitation, absence of arterial hypertension, higher intraocular pressure, higher myopic refractive error, thicker central corneal thickness, and presence of glaucoma. It was not associated with non-glaucomatous optic nerve damage."
https://openalex.org/W2109779276,"Vacuolar-type rotary H(+)-ATPase/synthase (V(o)V(1)) from Thermus thermophilus, composed of nine subunits, A, B, D, F, C, E, G, I, and L, has been reconstituted from individually isolated V(1) (A(3)B(3)D(1)F(1)) and V(o) (C(1)E(2)G(2)I(1)L(12)) subcomplexes in vitro. A(3)B(3)D and A(3)B(3) also reconstituted with V(o), resulting in a holoenzyme-like complexes. However, A(3)B(3)D-V(o) and A(3)B(3)-V(o) did not show ATP synthesis and dicyclohexylcarbodiimide-sensitive ATPase activity. The reconstitution process was monitored in real time by fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between an acceptor dye attached to subunit F or D in V(1) or A(3)B(3)D and a donor dye attached to subunit C in V(o). The estimated dissociation constants K(d) for V(o)V(1) and A(3)B(3)D-V(o) were ∼0.3 and ∼1 nm at 25 °C, respectively. These results suggest that the A(3)B(3) domain tightly associated with the two EG peripheral stalks of V(o), even in the absence of the central shaft subunits. In addition, F subunit is essential for coupling of ATP hydrolysis and proton translocation and has a key role in the stability of whole complex. However, the contribution of the F subunit to the association of A(3)B(3) with V(o) is much lower than that of the EG peripheral stalks."
https://openalex.org/W2046795066,"The canonical pathway for protein kinase D1 (PKD1) activation by growth factor receptors involves diacylglycerol binding to the C1 domain and protein kinase C-dependent phosphorylation at the activation loop. PKD1 then autophosphorylates at Ser(916), a modification frequently used as a surrogate marker of PKD1 activity. PKD1 also is cleaved by caspase-3 at a site in the C1-PH interdomain during apoptosis; the functional consequences of this cleavage event remain uncertain. This study shows that PKD1-Δ1-321 (an N-terminal deletion mutant lacking the C1 domain and flanking sequence that models the catalytic fragment that accumulates during apoptosis) and PKD1-CD (the isolated catalytic domain) display high basal Ser(916) autocatalytic activity and robust activity toward CREBtide (a peptide substrate) but little to no activation loop autophosphorylation and no associated activity toward protein substrates, such as cAMP-response element binding protein and cardiac troponin I. In contrast, PKD1-ΔPH (a PH domain deletion mutant) is recovered as a constitutively active enzyme, with high basal autocatalytic activity and high basal activity toward peptide and protein substrates. These results indicate that individual regions in the regulatory domain act in a distinct manner to control PKD1 activity. Finally, cell-based studies show that PKD1-Δ1-321 does not substitute for WT-PKD1 as an in vivo activator of cAMP-response element binding protein and ERK phosphorylation. Proteolytic events that remove the C1 domain (but not the autoinhibitory PH domain) limit maximal PKD1 activity toward physiologically relevant protein substrates and lead to a defect in PKD1-dependent cellular responses."
https://openalex.org/W2092398226,"During the G(1)-S transition, the activity of Cdk2 is regulated by its association with p27(KIP1), which in rodent fibroblasts undergoes phosphorylation mainly at serine 10, threonine 187, and C-terminal threonine 197 by KIS, Cdk2, and Pim or ROCK, respectively. Recently Cdc6 the AAA+ ATPase, identified initially to assemble pre-replicative complexes on origins of replication and later to activate p21(CIP1)-inactivated Cdk2, was found also to activate p27-bound Cdk2 but only after the bound p27 is C-terminally phosphorylated. On the other hand, the biological significance of the serine 10 phosphorylation remains elusive aside from its involvement in the stability of p27 itself. We report here that serine 10 phosphorylation is required for efficient C-terminal phosphorylation of its own by PIM and ROCK kinases and critically controls the potency of p27 as a Cdk2 inhibitor. In vitro, PIM1 and active ROCK1 efficiently phosphorylated free as well as Cdk2-bound p27 but only when the p27 was phosphorylated at Ser-10 in advance. Consistently, a Ser-10 nonphosphorylatable mutant p27 protein was not phosphorylated at the C terminus in vivo. Furthermore, when double-phosphorylated, free p27 was no longer a potent inhibitor of Cdk2, and Cdk2-bound p27 could be removed by Cdc6 to reactivate the Cdk2. Thus, phosphorylation at these two sites crucially controls the potency of this CDK inhibitor in two distinct modes."
https://openalex.org/W2001310890,"To establish a genetic tool for conditional deletion or expression of gene in neurons in a temporally controlled manner, we generated a transgenic mouse (NSE-MerCreMer), which expressed a tamoxifen inducible type of Cre recombinase specifically in neurons. The tamoxifen inducible Cre recombinase (MerCreMer) is a fusion protein containing Cre recombinase with two modified estrogen receptor ligand binding domains at both ends, and is driven by the neural-specific rat neural specific enolase (NSE) promoter. A total of two transgenic lines were established, and expression of MerCreMer in neurons of the central and enteric nervous systems was confirmed. Transcript of MerCreMer was detected in several non-neural tissues such as heart, liver, and kidney in these lines. In the background of the Cre reporter mouse strain Rosa26R, Cre recombinase activity was inducible in neurons of adult NSE-MerCreMer mice treated with tamoxifen by intragastric gavage, but not in those fed with corn oil only. We conclude that NSE-MerCreMer lines will be useful for studying gene functions in neurons for the conditions that Cre-mediated recombination resulting in embryonic lethality, which precludes investigation of gene functions in neurons through later stages of development and in adult."
https://openalex.org/W2033902006,"Understanding the organization and function of transcriptional regulatory networks by analyzing high-throughput gene expression profiles is a key problem in computational biology. The challenges in this work are 1) the lack of complete knowledge of the regulatory relationship between the regulators and the associated genes, 2) the potential for spurious associations due to confounding factors, and 3) the number of parameters to learn is usually larger than the number of available microarray experiments. We present a sparse (L1 regularized) graphical model to address these challenges. Our model incorporates known transcription factors and introduces hidden variables to represent possible unknown transcription and confounding factors. The expression level of a gene is modeled as a linear combination of the expression levels of known transcription factors and hidden factors. Using gene expression data covering 39,296 oligonucleotide probes from 1109 human liver samples, we demonstrate that our model better predicts out-of-sample data than a model with no hidden variables. We also show that some of the gene sets associated with hidden variables are strongly correlated with Gene Ontology categories.
