https://openalex.org/W2084486673,"Xiaowen Sun and colleagues report the whole-genome sequencing of the common carp, Cyprinus carpio. They also resequenced 33 representative accessions from a worldwide collection and provide insights into population structure and evolution. The common carp, Cyprinus carpio, is one of the most important cyprinid species and globally accounts for 10% of freshwater aquaculture production. Here we present a draft genome of domesticated C. carpio (strain Songpu), whose current assembly contains 52,610 protein-coding genes and approximately 92.3% coverage of its paleotetraploidized genome (2n = 100). The latest round of whole-genome duplication has been estimated to have occurred approximately 8.2 million years ago. Genome resequencing of 33 representative individuals from worldwide populations demonstrates a single origin for C. carpio in 2 subspecies (C. carpio Haematopterus and C. carpio carpio). Integrative genomic and transcriptomic analyses were used to identify loci potentially associated with traits including scaling patterns and skin color. In combination with the high-resolution genetic map, the draft genome paves the way for better molecular studies and improved genome-assisted breeding of C. carpio and other closely related species."
https://openalex.org/W2070604281,"Ping Chi and colleagues identify recurrent inactivating mutations in the PRC2 core components EED and SUZ12 in malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors. They further show that PRC2 loss is associated with loss of H3K27 trimethylation and aberrant expression of PRC2 target genes and downstream pathways. Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) represent a group of highly aggressive soft-tissue sarcomas that may occur sporadically, in association with neurofibromatosis type I (NF1 associated) or after radiotherapy1,2,3. Using comprehensive genomic approaches, we identified loss-of-function somatic alterations of the Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) components (EED or SUZ12) in 92% of sporadic, 70% of NF1-associated and 90% of radiotherapy-associated MPNSTs. MPNSTs with PRC2 loss showed complete loss of trimethylation at lysine 27 of histone H3 (H3K27me3) and aberrant transcriptional activation of multiple PRC2-repressed homeobox master regulators and their regulated developmental pathways. Introduction of the lost PRC2 component in a PRC2-deficient MPNST cell line restored H3K27me3 levels and decreased cell growth. Additionally, we identified frequent somatic alterations of CDKN2A (81% of all MPNSTs) and NF1 (72% of non-NF1-associated MPNSTs), both of which significantly co-occur with PRC2 alterations. The highly recurrent and specific inactivation of PRC2 components, NF1 and CDKN2A highlights their critical and potentially cooperative roles in MPNST pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2001790878,Polymorphous low-grade adenocarcinoma (PLGA) is the second most frequent type of malignant tumor of the minor salivary glands. We identified PRKD1 hotspot mutations encoding p.Glu710Asp in 72.9% of PLGAs but not in other salivary gland tumors. Functional studies demonstrated that this kinase-activating alteration likely constitutes a driver of PLGA.
https://openalex.org/W1981282682,"Background Hypothesizing that nutritional status, systemic inflammation and tumoral immune microenvironment play a role as determinants of lung cancer evolution, the purpose of this study was to assess their respective impact on long-term survival in resected non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC). Methods and Findings Clinical, pathological and laboratory data of 303 patients surgically treated for NSCLC were retrospectively analyzed. C-reactive protein (CRP) and prealbumin levels were recorded, and tumoral infiltration by CD8+ lymphocytes and mature dendritic cells was assessed. We observed that factors related to nutritional status, systemic inflammation and tumoral immune microenvironment were correlated; significant correlations were also found between these factors and other relevant clinical-pathological parameters. With respect to outcome, at univariate analysis we found statistically significant associations between survival and the following variables: Karnofsky index, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) class, CRP levels, prealbumin concentrations, extent of resection, pathologic stage, pT and pN parameters, presence of vascular emboli, and tumoral infiltration by either CD8+ lymphocytes or mature dendritic cells and, among adenocarcinoma type, tumor grade (all p<0.05). In multivariate analysis, prealbumin levels (Relative Risk (RR): 0.34 [0.16–0.73], p = 0.0056), CD8+ cell count in tumor tissue (RR = 0.37 [0.16–0.83], p = 0.0162), and disease stage (RR 1.73 [1.03–2.89]; 2.99[1.07–8.37], p = 0.0374- stage I vs II vs III-IV) were independent prognostic markers. When taken together, parameters related to systemic inflammation, nutrition and tumoral immune microenvironment allowed robust prognostic discrimination; indeed patients with undetectable CRP, high (>285 mg/L) prealbumin levels and high (>96/mm2) CD8+ cell count had a 5-year survival rate of 80% [60.9–91.1] as compared to 18% [7.9–35.6] in patients with an opposite pattern of values. When stages I-II were considered alone, the prognostic significance of these factors was even more pronounced. Conclusions Our data show that nutrition, systemic inflammation and tumoral immune contexture are prognostic determinants that, taken together, may predict outcome."
https://openalex.org/W2067894224,"Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) is a polar organic solvent that is used to dissolve neuroprotective or neurotoxic agents in neuroscience research. However, DMSO itself also has pharmacological and pathological effects on the nervous system. Astrocytes play a central role in maintaining brain homeostasis, but the effect and mechanism of DMSO on astrocytes has not been studied. The present study showed that exposure of astrocyte cultures to 1% DMSO for 24 h did not significantly affect cell survival, but decreased cell viability and glial glutamate transporter expression, and caused mitochondrial swelling, membrane potential impairment and reactive oxygen species production, and subsequent cytochrome c release and caspase-3 activation. DMSO at concentrations of 5% significantly inhibited cell variability and promoted apoptosis of astrocytes, accompanied with more severe mitochondrial damage. These results suggest that mitochondrial impairment is a primary event in DMSO-induced astrocyte toxicity. The potential cytotoxic effects on astrocytes need to be carefully considered during investigating neuroprotective or neurotoxic effects of hydrophobic agents dissolved by DMSO."
https://openalex.org/W2086163393,"The presenilin-containing γ-secretase complex produces the amyloid β-peptide (Aβ) through intramembrane proteolysis, and >100 presenilin mutations are associated with familial early-onset Alzheimer disease (AD). The question of whether these mutations result in AD through a gain or a loss of function remains highly controversial. Mutations in presenilins increase ratios of 42- to 40-residue Aβ critical to pathogenesis, but other Aβs of 38–49 residues are also formed by γ-secretase. Evidence in cells suggests the protease first cleaves substrate within the transmembrane domain at the ϵ site to form 48- or 49-residue Aβ. Subsequent cleavage almost every three residues from the C terminus is thought to occur along two pathways toward shorter secreted forms of Aβ: Aβ49 → Aβ46 → Aβ43 → Aβ40 and Aβ48 → Aβ45 → Aβ42 → Aβ38. Here we show that the addition of synthetic long Aβ peptides (Aβ45–49) directly into purified preparations of γ-secretase leads to the formation of Aβ40 and Aβ42 whether the protease complex is detergent-solubilized or reconstituted into lipid vesicles, and the ratios of products Aβ42 to Aβ40 follow a pattern consistent with the dual-pathway hypothesis. Kinetic analysis of five different AD-causing mutations in presenilin-1 revealed that all result in drastic reduction of normal carboxypeptidase function. Altered trimming of long Aβ peptides to Aβ40 and Aβ42 by mutant proteases occurs at multiple levels, independent of the effects on initial endoproteolysis at the ϵ site, all conspiring to increase the critical Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio implicated in AD pathogenesis. Taken together, these results suggest that specific reduction of carboxypeptidase function of γ-secretase leads to the gain of toxic Aβ42/Aβ40.

Spillantini M.G. A century of Alzheimer's disease.Science. 2006; 314: 777-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (1589) Google Scholar). A large body of evidence points to Aβ as the pathogenic initiator, most notably the identification of dominant missense mutations in the amyloid β-protein precursor (APP) and the presenilins that cause early-onset familial AD (FAD) (2.Tanzi R.E. Bertram L. Twenty years of the Alzheimer's disease amyloid hypothesis: a genetic perspective.Cell. 2005; 120: 545-555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1492) Google Scholar) and the discovery of presenilin as the catalytic component of γ-secretase responsible for generation of the Aβ C terminus (3.Wolfe M.S.

More than 100 FAD presenilin mutations have been identified, and these mutations can cause a decrease in γ-secretase cleavage of substrates as well as an increase in the ratio of the more aggregation-prone 42-residue Aβ (Aβ42) over the major secreted 40-residue Aβ (Aβ40). These findings have led to a still unresolved controversy over whether presenilin mutations cause FAD through a loss or a gain of function (4.Shen J. Kelleher 3rd., R.J.

In deciphering the effects of presenilin FAD mutations, it is critical to consider the various proteolytic functions of γ-secretase. First, upon assembly with the other three components of the protease complex, presenilin undergoes autoproteolysis (3.Wolfe M.S. Xia W. Ostaszewski B.L. Diehl T.S. Kimberly W.T. Selkoe D.J.

Borchelt D.R. Lee M.K. Slunt H.H. Spitzer L. Kim G. Ratovitsky T. Davenport F. Nordstedt C. Seeger M. Hardy J. Levey A.I. Gandy S.E. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Price D.L. Sisodia S.S.

FAD-mutant presenilins likewise undergo NTF/CTF formation, with one notable exception (Δexon9, which is active as a holoprotein (10.Thinakaran G. Borchelt D.R. Lee M.K. Slunt H.H. Spitzer L. Kim G.

Second, γ-secretase has endoproteolytic activity toward membrane stubs of APP and other substrates generated upon ectodomain release by sheddases (11.Haapasalo A. Kovacs D.M. The many substrates of presenilin/γ-secretase.J. Alzheimers Dis. 2011; 25: 3-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). This cleavage occurs within the substrate transmembrane domain to release the intracellular domain. For APP, the endoproteolytic site (called the ϵ site) is located close to the transmembrane/cytosolic boundary (Fig. 1A) (12.Weidemann A. Eggert S. Reinhard F.B. Vogel M. Paliga K. Baier G. Masters C.L. Beyreuther K. Evin G. A novel var ϵ-cleavage within the transmembrane domain of the Alzheimer amyloid precursor protein demonstrates homology with notch processing.Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 2825-2835Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar), with cleavage here releasing the APP intracellular domain (AICD). Reduction of ϵ cleavage is seen with many, although not all, FAD presenilin mutations (7.Chávez-Gutiérrez L. Bammens L. Benilova I. Vandersteen A. Benurwar M. Borgers M. Lismont S. Zhou L.

In recent years evidence has mounted in support of a third type of proteolytic function of the γ-secretase complex, a carboxypeptidase activity that trims membrane-associated long Aβ peptides of 48 or 49 residues to shorter secreted forms of 38–43 amino acids (15.Funamoto S.

Biochemical and cellular studies suggest that the endoproteolytic ϵ cleavage of APP substrate occurs first and that the resultant long Aβ peptides are primarily trimmed in intervals of three amino acids along two product lines (Fig. 1A), with Aβ49 leading to Aβ46, Aβ43 and Aβ40 and Aβ48 leading to Aβ45, Aβ42, and Aβ38 (this last event removing a tetrapeptide). The expected tri- and tetrapeptide products have been detected by mass spectrometry (18.Takami M. Nagashima Y. Sano Y. Ishihara S. Morishima-Kawashima M. Funamoto S.

The former contention has been disproven by the determination of equimolar Aβ and AICD production (24.Kakuda N. Funamoto S. Yagishita S. Takami M. Osawa S. Dohmae N. Ihara Y. Equimolar production of amyloid β-protein and amyloid precursor protein intracellular domain from β-carboxyl-terminal fragment by γ-secretase.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 14776-14786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), and the latter has been unambiguously settled recently with the demonstration that synthetic Aβ42 is converted to Aβ38 by isolated γ-secretase (25.Okochi M.

In this study we developed a method for examining the carboxypeptidase cleavage of synthetic Aβ48 and Aβ49 by isolated or purified enzyme complexes, independent of their initial formation through ϵ proteolysis of APP substrate. In so doing, we confirm that these long Aβ peptides are indeed intermediates toward Aβ40 and Aβ42, provide support for the dual-pathway model, and determine the degree to which long Aβ peptides contribute to the critical Aβ42-to-Aβ40 ratio. This biochemical system also allowed evaluation of the role of the membrane in the carboxypeptidase activity. Most notably, kinetic analysis of Aβ40 and Aβ42 production from long Aβ peptides by FAD mutant presenilin-1·γ-secretase complexes revealed striking reductions in carboxypeptidase activity that have important implications for resolving the loss-of-function versus gain-of-function controversy and providing a unifying model for the pathogenic mechanism of presenilin mutations. CHAPSO-solubilized membranes from S20 cells, which are CHO cells overexpressing all four γ-secretase components, were prepared as previously described (26.Cacquevel M. Aeschbach L. Osenkowski P.

The lysate was spun at low speed to remove nuclei and unbroken cells and then at 100,000 × g. The resulting membrane pellet was washed in sodium bicarbonate buffer and solubilized in 2 ml of 1% CHAPSO. For purified γ-secretase preparations, membranes from 160 confluent 15-cm plates of S20 cells were isolated, washed, and solubilized as described above, and γ-secretase complexes were purified by sequential affinity purifications via nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose beads (Sigma) and M2 immobilized anti-FLAG-agarose beads (Sigma). For the inactive mutant enzyme controls, both solubilized membranes and purified complexes were prepared from CHO D1 cells (overexpressing all four γ-secretase components but with D257A mutant PS1 containing an N-terminal Myc tag) in the same way as above, except the first affinity purification step involved anti-Myc antibody-agarose beads (Sigma). For the analysis of FAD PS1 mutant complexes, membranes were prepared from CHO cells overexpressing Pen2, Aph1, nicastrin, and either WT or mutant PS1 as previously reported (14.Quintero-Monzon O.

Samples of WT and FAD mutant membrane preparations were run on 4–12% Bis-Tris gels followed by Western blotting with mAb1563 (Millipore), which detects PS1 NTF. The signal was captured using ECL (GE Healthcare), densitometry was performed on the films using ImageQuant (GE Healthcare), and the amount of enzyme added to each reaction was normalized based on the measured level of PS1 NTF (or holoprotein in the case of the uncleavable Δexon9). Time course experiments were first performed with the FAD mutants to establish the linear range of product formation. Reactions were then carried out with varying concentrations of substrate within this linear time frame. Aβ40 and Aβ42 products were quantified by specific ELISAs (Invitrogen), and non-linear regression analysis with Km and Vmax determination was performed using GraphPad Prism 4. All CHO cell lines were grown in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum. For the analysis of long Aβ trimming in cells, APP truncated at residues 49 and 48 (Aβ numbering) and harboring the Swedish double mutation were cloned and expressed using the Tet-On system (Clontech). 100,000 CHO cells/well were seeded into 24-well plates. Upon reaching ∼50% confluence, cells were transiently co-transfected with a 1:5 ratio of the pTet-On Advanced plasmid (Clontech) and a pTRE-Tight plasmid (Clontech) carrying the truncated APP sequence. Six hours post-transfection, the medium was changed to DMEM complete containing 1 µg/ml doxycycline to induce the expression of the truncated APP. Inhibitor control transfections were also treated with 10 µm DAPT at this time. After 24 h cells and conditioned media were harvested. Aβ40 and Aβ42 in the media were measured by specific ELISAs (Meso Scale Discovery). Cells from each well were lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer, and the intracellular protein concentration was measured by a BCA assay (Pierce). Western blot analysis for APPϵ49 and APPϵ48 in cell lysates was carried out using anti-APP antibody 22C11 (Millipore). Comparisons of more than two groups were carried out using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Dunnett's post hoc test using WT values as the control group. Statistical significance between two groups was determined by unpaired two-tailed Student's t test. We first examined the production of Aβ40 and Aβ42 from synthetic Aβ48 and Aβ49 in vitro, which allowed us to demonstrate the C-terminal trimming of ϵ-site Aβ peptides by γ-secretase using isolated enzyme and substrate. We could also directly examine the model in which Aβ48 processing leads primarily to Aβ42 and Aβ49 primarily to Aβ40 (18.Takami M. Nagashima Y. Sano Y. Ishihara S. Morishima-Kawashima M. Funamoto S.

However, trimmed Aβ generated from the synthetic long Aβ substrates could not be detected by this method because the signal from the excess substrate streaked throughout the lane, completely obscuring any signals from the Aβ products (data not shown). The levels of Aβ40 and Aβ42 produced from each synthetic long Aβ were instead quantified using specific ELISAs. The data reveal that Aβ48 and Aβ49 are indeed trimmed by γ-secretase to Aβ40 and Aβ42 in both the CHAPSO-solubilized (Fig. 1B) and proteoliposome systems (Fig. 1C). Control reactions with Aβ substrate alone (in which no enzyme was added to the reaction mixture) give the base-line levels of cross-reactivity of the large amounts of long Aβ substrates in the assays with each ELISA detection antibody. Although there is some cross-reactivity, the results indicate that the signal obtained in the reactions with enzyme present is not simply background. Furthermore, the addition of the γ-secretase transition-state analog inhibitor L-685,458 to the assays results in inhibition of Aβ40 and Aβ42 production. Heat-inactivated or inactive PS1 D257A (D1) γ-secretase showed no Aβ production above background. In addition, no Aβ40 or Aβ42 was detected from solubilized membranes or proteoliposomes incubated without substrate, ensuring that the Aβ40 and Aβ42 produced is not due to cleavage of endogenous substrate present in the enzyme preparations. γ-Secretase modulators (GSMs) also had the effect on trimming that they typically have on Aβ production (32.Golde T.E.

The multivariable risk associated with co-sleeping on a sofa (OR = 18.3 [95% CI: 7.1-47.4]) or next to a parent who drank more than two units of alcohol (OR = 18.3 [95% CI: 7.7-43.5]) was very high and significant for infants of all ages. The risk associated with co-sleeping next to someone who smoked was significant for infants under 3 months old (OR = 8.9 [95% CI: 5.3-15.1]) but not for older infants (OR = 1.4 [95% CI: 0.7-2.8]). The multivariable risk associated with bed-sharing in the absence of these hazards was not significant overall (OR = 1.1 [95% CI: 0.6-2.0]), for infants less than 3 months old (OR = 1.6 [95% CI: 0.96-2.7]), and was in the direction of protection for older infants (OR = 0.1 [95% CI: 0.01-0.5]). Dummy use was associated with a lower risk of SIDS only among co-sleepers and prone sleeping was a higher risk only among infants sleeping alone.These findings support a public health strategy that underlines specific hazardous co-sleeping environments parents should avoid. Sofa-sharing is not a safe alternative to bed-sharing and bed-sharing should be avoided if parents consume alcohol, smoke or take drugs or if the infant is pre-term."
https://openalex.org/W2043857262,"Objective Interaction of stromal and tumor cells plays a dynamic role in initiating and enhancing carcinogenesis. In this study, we investigated the crosstalk between colorectal cancer (CRC) cells with stromal fibroblasts and the anti-cancer effects of curcumin and 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU), especially on cancer stem cell (CSC) survival in a 3D-co-culture model that mimics in vivo tumor microenvironment. Methods Colon carcinoma cells HCT116 and MRC-5 fibroblasts were co-cultured in a monolayer or high density tumor microenvironment model in vitro with/without curcumin and/or 5-FU. Results Monolayer tumor microenvironment co-cultures supported intensive crosstalk between cancer cells and fibroblasts and enhanced up-regulation of metastatic active adhesion molecules (β1-integrin, ICAM-1), transforming growth factor-β signaling molecules (TGF-β3, p-Smad2), proliferation associated proteins (cyclin D1, Ki-67) and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) factor (vimentin) in HCT116 compared with tumor mono-cultures. High density tumor microenvironment co-cultures synergistically increased tumor-promoting factors (NF-κB, MMP-13), TGF-β3, favored CSC survival (characterized by up-regulation of CD133, CD44, ALDH1) and EMT-factors (increased vimentin and Slug, decreased E-cadherin) in HCT116 compared with high density HCT116 mono-cultures. Interestingly, this synergistic crosstalk was even more pronounced in the presence of 5-FU, but dramatically decreased in the presence of curcumin, inducing biochemical changes to mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET), thereby sensitizing CSCs to 5-FU treatment. Conclusion Enrichment of CSCs, remarkable activation of tumor-promoting factors and EMT in high density co-culture highlights that the crosstalk in the tumor microenvironment plays an essential role in tumor development and progression, and this interaction appears to be mediated at least in part by TGF-β and EMT. Modulation of this synergistic crosstalk by curcumin might be a potential therapy for CRC and suppress metastasis."
https://openalex.org/W1993283926,"Pannexins constitute a family of three glycoproteins (Panx1, -2, and -3) forming single membrane channels. Recent work demonstrated that Panx1 is expressed in skeletal muscle and involved in the potentiation of contraction. However, Panxs functions in skeletal muscle cell differentiation, and proliferation had yet to be assessed. We show here that Panx1 and Panx3, but not Panx2, are present in human and rodent skeletal muscle, and their various species are differentially expressed in fetal versus adult human skeletal muscle tissue. Panx1 levels were very low in undifferentiated human primary skeletal muscle cells and myoblasts (HSMM) but increased drastically during differentiation and became the main Panx expressed in differentiated cells. Using HSMM, we found that Panx1 expression promotes this process, whereas it was impaired in the presence of probenecid or carbenoxolone. As for Panx3, its lower molecular weight species were prominent in adult skeletal muscle but very low in the fetal tissue and in undifferentiated skeletal muscle cells and myoblasts. Its overexpression (∼43-kDa species) induced HSMM differentiation and also inhibited their proliferation. On the other hand, a ∼70-kDa immunoreactive species of Panx3, likely glycosylated, sialylated, and phosphorylated, was highly expressed in proliferative myoblasts but strikingly down-regulated during their differentiation. Reduction of its endogenous expression using two Panx3 shRNAs significantly inhibited HSMM proliferation without triggering their differentiation. In summary, our results demonstrate that Panx1 and Panx3 are co-expressed in human skeletal muscle myoblasts and play a pivotal role in dictating the proliferation and differentiation status of these cells."
https://openalex.org/W2109482455,"Background The increasing use of multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) will inevitably lead to the exposure of wastewater treatment facilities. However, knowledge of the impacts of MWCNTs on wastewater nutrient removal and bacterial community structure in the activated sludge process is sparse. Aims To investigate the effects of MWCNTs on wastewater nutrient removal, and bacterial community structure in activated sludge. Methods Three triplicate sequencing batch reactors (SBR) were exposed to wastewater which contained 0, 1, and 20 mg/L MWCNTs. MiSeq sequencing was used to investigate the bacterial community structures in activated sludge samples which were exposed to different concentrations of MWCNTs. Results Exposure to 1 and 20 mg/L MWCNTs had no acute (1 day) impact on nutrient removal from wastewater. After long-term (180 days) exposure to 1 mg/L MWCNTs, the average total nitrogen (TN) removal efficiency was not significantly affected. TN removal efficiency decreased from 84.0% to 71.9% after long-term effects of 20 mg/L MWCNTs. After long-term exposure to 1 and 20 mg/L MWCNTs, the total phosphorus removal efficiencies decreased from 96.8% to 52.3% and from 98.2% to 34.0% respectively. Further study revealed that long-term exposure to 20 mg/L MWCNTs inhibited activities of ammonia monooxygenase and nitrite oxidoreductase. Long-term exposure to 1 and 20 mg/L MWCNTs both inhibited activities of exopolyphosphatase and polyphosphate kinase. MiSeq sequencing data indicated that 20 mg/L MWCNTs significantly decreased the diversity of bacterial community in activated sludge. Long-term exposure to 1 and 20 mg/L MWCNTs differentially decreased the abundance of nitrifying bacteria, especially ammonia-oxidizing bacteria. The abundance of PAOs was decreased after long-term exposure to 20 mg/L MWCNTs. The abundance of glycogen accumulating organisms (GAOs) was increased after long-term exposure to 1 mg/L MWCNTs. Conclusion MWCNTs have adverse effects on biological wastewater nutrient removal, and altered the diversity and structure of bacterial community in activated sludge."
https://openalex.org/W1996894475,"Humans have a strong preference for fair distributions of resources. Neuroimaging studies have shown that being treated unfairly coincides with activation in brain regions involved in signaling conflict and negative affect. Less is known about neural responses involved in violating a fairness norm ourselves. Here, we investigated the neural patterns associated with inequity, where participants were asked to choose between an equal split of money and an unequal split that could either maximize their own (advantageous inequity) or another person's (disadvantageous inequity) earnings. Choosing to divide money unequally, irrespective who benefited from the unequal distribution, was associated with activity in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, anterior insula and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Inequity choices that maximized another person's profits were further associated with activity in the ventral striatum and ventromedial prefrontal cortex. Taken together, our findings show evidence of a common neural pattern associated with both advantageous and disadvantageous inequity in sharing decisions and additional recruitment of neural circuitry previously linked to the computation of subjective value and reward when violating a fairness norm at the benefit of someone else."
https://openalex.org/W2017447898,"In this study, we evaluated the effect of astragaloside IV (Ast IV) post-ischemia treatment on myocardial ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury (IRI). We also examined whether hypoxia inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) and its downstream gene-inducible nitric oxide (NO) synthase (iNOS) play roles in the cardioprotective effect of Ast IV. Cultured cardiomyocytes and perfused isolated rat hearts were exposed to Ast IV during reperfusion in the presence or absence of the HIF-1α inhibitor 2-methoxyestradiol (2-MeOE2). The post-ischemia treatment with Ast IV protected cardiomyocytes from the apoptosis and death induced by simulated IRI (SIRI). Additionally, in cardiomyocytes, 2-MeOE2 and HIF-1α siRNA treatment each not only abolished the anti-apoptotic effect of post-ischemia treatment with Ast IV but also reversed the upregulation of HIF-1α and iNOS expression. Furthermore, after treatment with Ast IV, post-ischemic cardiac functional recovery and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release in the coronary flow (CF) were improved, and the myocardial infarct size was decreased. Moreover, the number of apoptotic cells was reduced, and the upregulation of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl2 and downregulation of the pro-apoptotic protein Caspase3 were reversed. 2-MeOE2 reversed these effects of Ast IV on IR-injured hearts. These results suggest that post-ischemia treatment with Ast IV can attenuate IRI by upregulating HIF-1α expression, which transmits a survival signal to the myocardium."
https://openalex.org/W2063531579,"Introduction Obesity is associated with low-grade systemic inflammation. The “inflammome” is a network layout of the inflammatory pattern. The systemic inflammome of obesity has not been described as yet. We hypothesized that it can be significantly worsened by smoking and other comorbidities frequently associated with obesity, and ameliorated by bariatric surgery (BS). Besides, whether or not these changes are mirrored in the lungs is unknown, but obesity is often associated with pulmonary inflammation and bronchial hyperresponsiveness. Objectives We sought to: (1) describe the systemic inflammome of morbid obesity; (2) investigate the effects of sex, smoking, sleep apnea syndrome, metabolic syndrome and BS upon this systemic inflammome; and, (3) determine their interplay with pulmonary inflammation. Methods We studied 129 morbidly obese patients (96 females; age 46±12 years; body mass index [BMI], 46±6 kg/m2) before and one year after BS, and 20 healthy, never-smokers, (43±7 years), with normal BMI and spirometry. Results Before BS, compared with controls, all obese subjects displayed a strong and coordinated (inflammome) systemic inflammatory response (adiponectin, C-reactive protein, interleukin (IL)-8, IL-10, leptin, soluble tumor necrosis factor-receptor 1(sTNF-R1), and 8-isoprostane). This inflammome was not modified by sex, smoking, or coexistence of obstructive sleep apnea and/or metabolic syndrome. By contrast, it was significantly ameliorated, albeit not completely abolished, after BS. Finally, obese subjects had evidence of pulmonary inflammation (exhaled condensate) that also decreased after BS. Conclusions The systemic inflammome of morbid obesity is independent of sex, smoking status and/or comorbidities, it is significantly reduced by BS and mirrored in the lungs."
https://openalex.org/W1980362801,"Background The neuropeptide Pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) plays pivotal roles in immunity and inflammation. So far, potential immune-modulatory properties of PACAP have not been investigated in experimental ileitis. Methodology/Principal Findings Mice were perorally infected with Toxoplasma (T.) gondii to induce acute ileitis (day 0) and treated daily with synthetic PACAP38 from day 1 to 6 post infection (p.i.; prophylaxis) or from day 4 to 6 p.i. (therapy). Whereas placebo-treated control mice suffered from acute ileitis at day 7 p.i. and succumbed to infection, intestinal immunopathology was ameliorated following PACAP prophylaxis. PACAP-treated mice exhibited increased abundance of small intestinal FOXP3+ cells, but lower numbers of ileal T lymphocytes, neutrophils, monocytes and macrophages, which was accompanied by less ileal expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-23p19, IL-22, IFN-γ, and MCP-1. Furthermore, PACAP-treated mice displayed higher anti-inflammatory IL-4 concentrations in mesenteric lymph nodes and liver and higher systemic anti-inflammatory IL-10 levels in spleen and serum as compared to control animals at day 7 p.i. Remarkably, PACAP-mediated anti-inflammatory effects could also be observed in extra-intestinal compartments as indicated by reduced pro-inflammatory mediator levels in spleen (TNF-α, nitric oxide) and liver (TNF-α, IFN-γ, MCP-1, IL-6) and less severe histopathological sequelae in lungs and kidneys following prophylactic PACAP treatment. Strikingly, PACAP prolonged survival of T. gondii infected mice in a time-of-treatment dependent manner. Conclusion/Significance Synthetic PACAP ameliorates acute small intestinal inflammation and extra-intestinal sequelae by down-regulating Th1-type immunopathology, reducing oxidative stress and up-regulating anti-inflammatory cytokine responses. These findings provide novel potential treatment options of inflammatory bowel diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2076763397,"Guidelines recommend Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) diagnosis and management in primary care with minimal investigations; however little evidence exists regarding risk of organic gastrointestinal conditions following diagnosis of IBS and how such risks vary over the long term. This study assesses excess incidence of coeliac disease, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and colorectal cancer (CRC) and variation with age and time after IBS diagnosis.IBS patients and controls were identified within the UK Clinical Practice Research Dataset. Incidence rates were calculated and stratified by age and time since IBS diagnosis with incident rate ratios generated.Fifteen years after IBS diagnosis there is a significant cumulative excess incidence of coeliac disease, IBD and CRC in IBS of 3.7% compared to 1.7% in controls. For every 10000 patient years, IBS patients experienced an additional 4 diagnoses of coeliac disease, 13 of IBD and 4 CRCs. In each condition peak excess incidence was in the 6 months following diagnosis. After one year, increased incidence of coeliac disease remained consistent without variation by age. IBD incidence fell slowly, with higher rates in those under 30. CRC incidence was increased only in patients aged 30 to 74 during the first 5 years.Some IBS patients later receive organic gastrointestinal diagnoses, with the early excess incidence likely detected during diagnostic investigation at the time of IBS diagnosis. More than 5 years after IBS diagnosis there is no increased risk of CRC compared to the general population, but a small excess risk of coeliac disease and IBD persists. Overall, though our findings provide reassurance that non-specialists, especially those in primary care, are unlikely to be missing an organic condition in the majority of their patients. This suggests that current guidelines suggesting avoidance of universal referral for these patients are appropriate."
https://openalex.org/W2092633406,"We investigated the impact of sexual stimuli and the influence of sexual motivation on the performance in a dot-probe task and a line-orientation task in a large sample of males and females. All pictures (neutral, erotic) were rated on the dimensions of valence, arousal, disgust, and sexual arousal. Additionally, questionnaires measuring sexual interest/desire/motivation were employed. The ratings of the sexual stimuli point to a successful picture selection because sexual arousal did not differ between the sexes. The stimuli were equally arousing for men and women. Higher scores in the employed questionnaires measuring sexual interest/desire/motivation led to higher sexual arousal ratings of the sex pictures. Attentional bias towards sex pictures was observed in both experimental tasks. The attentional biases measured by the dot-probe and the line-orientation task were moderately intercorrelated suggesting attentional bias as a possible marker for a sex-attention trait. Finally, only the sexual sensation seeking score correlated with the attentional biases of the two tasks. Future research is needed to increase the predictive power of these indirect measures of sexual interest."
https://openalex.org/W2156936493,"Ras homolog family member A (RhoA) and Rho-associated coiled coil-containing protein kinases 1 and 2 (ROCK1 and 2) are key regulators of focal adhesion, actomyosin contraction and cell motility. RhoA/ROCK signaling has emerged as an attractive target for the development of new cancer therapeutics. Whether RhoA/ROCK is involved in regulating the formation of tumor cell vasculogenic mimicry (VM) is largely unknown. To confirm this hypothesis, we performed in vitro experiments using hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell lines. Firstly, we demonstrated that HCC cells with higher active RhoA/ROCK expression were prone to form VM channels, as compared with RhoA/ROCK low-expressing cells. Furthermore, Y27632 (a specific inhibitor of ROCK) rather than exoenzyme C3 (a specific inhibitor of RhoA) effectively inhibited the formation of tubular network structures in a dose-dependent manner. To elucidate the possible mechanism of ROCK on VM formation, real-time qPCR, western blot and immunofluorescence were used to detect changes of the key VM-related factors, including VE-cadherin, erythropoietin-producing hepatocellular carcinoma-A2 (EphA2), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)14, MMP2, MMP9 and laminin 5γ2-chain (LAMC2), and epithelial-mesenchymal-transition (EMT) markers: E-cadherin and Vimentin. The results showed that all the expression profiles were attenuated by blockage of ROCK. In addition, in vitro cell migration and invasion assays showed that Y27632 inhibited the migration and invasion capacity of HCC cell lines in a dose-dependent manner markedly. These data indicate that ROCK is an important mediator in the formation of tumor cell VM, and suggest that ROCK inhibition may prove useful in the treatment of VM in HCC."
https://openalex.org/W1976148577,"Atrazine is a widely used herbicide with great environmental concern due to its high potential to contaminate soil and waters. An atrazine-degrading bacterial strain HB-6 was isolated from industrial wastewater and the 16S rRNA gene sequencing identified HB-6 as a Bacillus subtilis. PCR assays indicated that HB-6 contained atrazine-degrading genes trzN, atzB and atzC. The strain HB-6 was capable of utilizing atrazine and cyanuric acid as a sole nitrogen source for growth and even cleaved the s-triazine ring and mineralized atrazine. The strain demonstrated a very high efficiency of atrazine biodegradation with a broad optimum pH and temperature ranges and could be enhanced by cooperating with other bacteria, suggesting its huge potential for remediation of atrazine-contaminated sites. To our knowledge, there are few Bacillus subtilis strains reported that can mineralize atrazine, therefore, the present work might provide some new insights on atrazine remediation."
https://openalex.org/W2076775134,"Background MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are known to regulate many biological processes and their dysregulation has been associated with a variety of diseases including Chronic Fatigue Syndrome/Myalgic Encephalomyelitis (CFS/ME). The recent discovery of stable and reproducible miRNA in plasma has raised the possibility that circulating miRNAs may serve as novel diagnostic markers. The objective of this study was to determine the role of plasma miRNA in CFS/ME. Results Using Illumina high-throughput sequencing we identified 19 miRNAs that were differentially expressed in the plasma of CFS/ME patients in comparison to non-fatigued controls. Following RT-qPCR analysis, we were able to confirm the significant up-regulation of three miRNAs (hsa-miR-127-3p, hsa-miR-142-5p and hsa-miR-143-3p) in the CFS/ME patients. Conclusion Our study is the first to identify circulating miRNAs from CFS/ME patients and also to confirm three differentially expressed circulating miRNAs in CFS/ME patients, providing a basis for further study to find useful CFS/ME biomarkers."
https://openalex.org/W2047926406,"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) patients have the highest risk of developing cachexia, which is a direct cause of reduced quality of life and shorter survival. Novel biomarkers to identify patients at risk of cachexia are needed and might have a substantial impact on clinical management. Here we investigated the prognostic value and association of SELP-rs6136, IL6-rs1800796 and AKT1-rs1130233 polymorphisms with cachexia in PDAC. Genotyping was performed in DNA from blood samples of a test and validation cohorts of 151 and 152 chemo-naive locally-advanced/metastatic PDAC patients, respectively. The association of SELP-rs6136, IL6-rs1800796 and AKT1-rs1130233 polymorphisms with cachexia as well as the correlation between cachexia and the candidate polymorphisms and overall survival were analyzed. Akt expression and phosphorylation in muscle biopsies were evaluated by specific ELISA assays. SELP-rs6136-AA and AKT1-rs1130233-AA/GA genotypes were associated with increased risk of developing cachexia in both cohorts (SELP: p = 0.011 and p = 0.045; AKT1: p = 0.004 and p = 0.019 for the first and second cohorts, respectively), while patients carrying AKT1-rs1130233-GG survived significantly longer (p = 0.002 and p = 0.004 for the first and second cohorts, respectively). In the multivariate analysis AKT1-rs1130233-AA/GA genotypes were significant predictors for shorter survival, with an increased risk of death of 1.7 (p = 0.002) and 1.6 (p = 0.004), in the first and second cohorts, respectively. This might be explained by the reduced phosphorylation of Akt1 in muscle biopsies from patients harboring AKT1-rs1130233-AA/GA (p = 0.003), favoring apoptosis induction. In conclusion, SELP and AKT1 polymorphisms may play a role in the risk of cachexia and death in PDAC patients, and should be further evaluated in larger prospective studies."
https://openalex.org/W1996486490,"Although albuminuria and subsequent advanced stage chronic kidney disease are common among patients with diabetes, the rate of increase in albuminuria varies among patients. Since genetic variants associated with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) were identified in cross sectional studies, we asked whether these variants were also associated with rate of increase in albuminuria among patients with diabetes from ONTARGET and TRANSCEND-randomized controlled trials of ramipril, telmisartan, both, or placebo. For 16 genetic variants associated with eGFR at a genome-wide level, we evaluated the association with annual rate of increase in albuminuria estimated from urine albumin:creatinine ratio (uACR). One of the variants (rs267734) was associated with rate of increase in albuminuria. The annual rate of increase in albuminuria among risk homozygotes (69% of the study population) was 11.3% (95%CI; 7.5% to 15.3%), compared with 5.0% (95%CI; 3.3% to 6.8%) for heterozygotes (27% of the population), and 1.7% (95%CI; -1.7% to 5.3%) for non-risk homozygotes (4% of the population); P = 0.0015 for the difference between annual rates in the three genotype groups. These estimates were adjusted for age, sex, ethnicity, and principal component of genetic heterogeneity. Among patients without albuminuria at baseline (uACR<30 mg/g), each risk allele was associated with 50% increased risk of incident albuminuria (OR = 1.50; 95%CI 1.15 to 1.95; P = 0.003) after further adjustment for traditional risk factors including baseline uACR and eGFR. The rs267734 variant is in almost perfect linkage-disequilibrium (r2 = 0.94) with rs267738, a single nucleotide polymorphism encoding a glutamic acid to alanine change at position 115 of the ceramide synthase 2 (CERS2) encoded protein. However, it is unknown whether CERS2 function influences albuminuria. In conclusion, we found that rs267734 in CERS2 is associated with rate of increase in albuminuria among patients with diabetes and elevated risk of cardiovascular disease."
https://openalex.org/W1986207150,"Posttranscriptional gene regulation is governed by a network of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) that interact with regulatory elements in the mRNA to modulate multiple molecular processes, including splicing, RNA transport, RNA stability, and translation. Mounting evidence indicates that there is a hierarchy within this network whereby certain RBPs cross-regulate other RBPs to coordinate gene expression. HuR, an RNA-binding protein we linked previously to aberrant VEGF mRNA metabolism in models of SOD1-associated amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, has been identified as being high up in this hierarchy, serving as a regulator of RNA regulators. Here we investigated the role of HuR in regulating two RBPs, TDP-43 and FUS/TLS, that have been linked genetically to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. We found that HuR promotes the expression of both RBPs in primary astrocytes and U251 cells under normal and stressed (hypoxic) conditions. For TDP-43, we found that HuR binds to the 3′ untranslated region (UTR) and regulates its expression through translational efficiency rather than RNA stability. With HuR knockdown, there was a shift of TDP-43 and FUS mRNAs away from polysomes, consistent with translational silencing. The TDP-43 splicing function was attenuated upon HuR knockdown and could be rescued by ectopic TDP-43 lacking the 3′ UTR regulatory elements. Finally, conditioned medium from astrocytes in which HuR or TDP-43 was knocked down produced significant motor neuron and cortical neuron toxicity in vitro. These findings indicate that HuR regulates TDP-43 and FUS/TLS expression and that loss of HuR-mediated RNA processing in astrocytes can alter the molecular and cellular landscape to produce a toxic phenotype.

https://openalex.org/W2002113121,"Sputum cultures are an important tool in monitoring the response to tuberculosis treatment, especially in multidrug-resistant tuberculosis. There has, however, been little study of the effect of treatment regimen composition on culture conversion. Well-designed clinical trials of new anti-tuberculosis drugs require this information to establish optimized background regimens for comparison. We conducted a retrospective cohort study to assess whether the use of an aggressive multidrug-resistant tuberculosis regimen was associated with more rapid sputum culture conversion. We conducted Cox proportional-hazards analyses to examine the relationship between receipt of an aggressive regimen for the 14 prior consecutive days and sputum culture conversion. Sputum culture conversion was achieved in 519 (87.7%) of the 592 patients studied. Among patients who had sputum culture conversion, the median time to conversion was 59 days (IQR: 31-92). In 480 patients (92.5% of those with conversion), conversion occurred within the first six months of treatment. Exposure to an aggressive regimen was independently associated with sputum culture conversion during the first six months of treatment (HR: 1.36; 95% CI: 1.10, 1.69). Infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HR 3.36; 95% CI: 1.47, 7.72) and receiving less exposure to tuberculosis treatment prior to the individualized multidrug-resistant tuberculosis regimen (HR: 1.58; 95% CI: 1.28, 1.95) were also independently positively associated with conversion. Tachycardia (HR: 0.77; 95% CI: 0.61, 0.98) and respiratory difficulty (HR: 0.78; 95% CI: 0.62, 0.97) were independently associated with a lower rate of conversion. This study is the first demonstrating that the composition of the multidrug-resistant tuberculosis treatment regimen influences the time to culture conversion. These results support the use of an aggressive regimen as the optimized background regimen in trials of new anti-TB drugs."
https://openalex.org/W2088377329,"We set out to study the key effectors of resistance and sensitivity to ErbB2 tyrosine kinase inhibitors, such as lapatinib in ErbB2-positive breast and lung cancers. A cell-based in vitro site-directed mutagenesis lapatinib resistance model identified several mutations, including the gatekeeper ErbB2 mutation ErbB2-T798I, as mediating resistance. ErbB2-T798I engineered cell models indeed show resistance to lapatinib but remain sensitive to the irreversible EGFR/ErbB2 inhibitor, PD168393, suggestive of potential alternative treatment strategies to overcome resistance. Gene expression profiling studies identified a select group of downstream targets regulated by ErbB2 signaling and define PHLDA1 as an immediately downregulated gene upon oncogenic ErbB2 signaling inhibition. We find significant down-regulation of PHLDA1 in primary breast cancer and PHLDA1 is statistically significantly less expressed in ErbB2 negative compared with ErbB2 positive tumors consistent with its regulation by ErbB2. Lastly, PHLDA1 overexpression blocks AKT signaling, inhibits cell growth and enhances lapatinib sensitivity further supporting an important negative growth regulator function. Our findings suggest that PHLDA1 might have key inhibitory functions in ErbB2 driven lung and breast cancer cells and a better understanding of its functions might point at novel therapeutic options. In summary, our studies define novel ways of modulating sensitivity and resistance to ErbB2 inhibition in ErbB2-dependent cancers."

We investigate the association between delayed and incomplete chemotherapy, and the association of delayed chemotherapy with survival in stage II colon cancer patients.Patients (age ≥ 66) diagnosed as stage II colon cancer and received chemotherapy from 1992 to 2005 were identified from the linked SEER-Medicare database. The association between delayed and incomplete chemotherapy was assessed using unconditional and conditional logistic regressions. Survival outcomes were assessed using stratified Cox regression based on propensity score matched samples.4,209 stage II colon cancer patients were included, of whom 73.0% had chemotherapy initiated timely (≤ 2 months after surgery), 14.7% had chemotherapy initiated with moderate delay (2-3 months), and 12.3% had delayed chemotherapy (≥ 3 months). Delayed chemotherapy was associated with not completing chemotherapy (adjusted odds ratio (OR): 1.33 (95% confidence interval: 1.11, 1.59) for moderately delayed group, adjusted OR: 2.60 (2.09, 3.24) for delayed group). Delayed chemotherapy was associated with worse survival outcomes (hazard ratio (HR): 1.75 (1.29, 2.37) for overall survival; HR: 4.23 (2.19, 8.20) for cancer-specific survival).Although the benefit of chemotherapy is unclear in stage II colon cancer patients, delay in initiation of chemotherapy is associated with an incomplete chemotherapy course and poorer survival, especially cancer-specific survival. Causal inference in the association between delayed initiation of chemotherapy and inferior survival requires further investigation."
https://openalex.org/W2168272520,"Background Liposomes are currently an important part of biological, pharmaceutical, medical and nutritional research, as they are considered to be among the most effective carriers for the introduction of various types of bioactive agents into target cells. Scope of Review In this work, we study the lipid organization and mechanical properties of biomembranes made of marine and plant phospholipids. Membranes based on phospholipids extracted from rapeseed and salmon are studied in the form of liposome and as supported lipid bilayer. Dioleylphosphatidylcholine (DOPC) and dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) are used as references to determine the lipid organization of marine and plant phospholipid based membranes. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) imaging and force spectroscopy measurements are performed to investigate the membranes' topography at the micrometer scale and to determine their mechanical properties. Major Conclusions The mechanical properties of the membranes are correlated to the fatty acid composition, the morphology, the electrophoretic mobility and the membrane fluidity. Thus, soft and homogeneous mechanical properties are evidenced for salmon phospholipids membrane containing various polyunsaturated fatty acids. Besides, phase segregation in rapeseed membrane and more important mechanical properties were emphasized for this type of membranes by contrast to the marine phospholipids based membranes. General Significance This paper provides new information on the nanomechanical and morphological properties of membrane in form of liposome by AFM. The originality of this work is to characterize the physico-chemical properties of the nanoliposome from the natural sources containing various fatty acids and polar head."
https://openalex.org/W1966122583,"Spontaneous preterm birth is the leading cause of infant death and of neurological disabilities in survivors. A significant proportion of spontaneous preterm births are associated with infection. Infection activates inflammation which induces a cascade of events that leads to myometrial contractions and rupture of fetal membranes. In non-gestational tissues, the citrus flavone nobiletin has been shown to exert potent anti-inflammatory properties. Thus, in this study, we sought to determine the effect of nobiletin on pro-inflammatory mediators in human fetal membranes and myometrium. Human fetal membranes and myometrium were treated with bacterial endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in the absence or presence of nobiletin. In addition, the effect of nobiletin in fetal membranes taken from spontaneous preterm deliveries with and without infection (i.e. histological chorioamnionitis) was also examined. In human fetal membranes and myometrium, nobiletin significantly decreased LPS-stimulated expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6 and IL-8) and MMP-9 expression and pro-MMP-9 secretion. Additionally, nobiletin significantly decreased COX-2 expression and subsequent prostaglandin (PG) E2 production. Notably, nobiletin was also able to reduce the expression and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and MMP-9 in fetal membranes taken from women after spontaneous preterm birth. In conclusion, our study demonstrates that nobiletin can reduce infection-induced pro-inflammatory mediators in human fetal membranes and myometrium. These in vitro studies further support the increasing volume and quality of evidence that high fruit and vegetable intake in pregnancy is associated with a decreased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes."

The plasma membrane organization of the AQP4 water channel is unique among AQPs for two reasons. First, all AQPs are formed by homotetramers, whereas AQP4 forms heterotetramers made of two similar isoforms, called AQP4-M1 and AQP4-M23 (4Rossi A. Pisani F. Nicchia G.P. Svelto M. Frigeri A.

AQP4 aggregation of itself into OAPs serves to enhance water permeability in those cellular domains, such as the perivascular one, where this physiological need is correlated to the fluid shifts occurring and to confer a higher level of plasma membrane stability to AQP4 water channels, confined in microdomains not delimited by tight junctions such as the glial processes (6Nicchia G.P.

In some cases, such as patients with non-longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis not fulfilling MRI criteria for MS or with longitudinal spinal cord lesions and MS-like brain lesions, anti-AQP4 antibodies are the only factor allowing discrimination between MS and NMO with high specificity (7Jarius S.

The aim of this study was research into NMO-IgG epitope key molecular determinants and the identification of AQP4 point mutations able to impair such an epitope, whereas preserving the water channel function and the OAP structure.

Extracellular loops A, C, and E, intracellular loops B and D, and the N-terminal region were changed in the homologues of AQP4 by site-directed mutagenesis, using the QuikChange site-directed II kit (Stratagene), according to the manufacturer's instructions, changing up to seven amino acids in a single step. The C-terminal region of AQP0 was changed with the relative AQP4, by PCR and restriction techniques. The KpnI restriction site was used to link two PCR products, then the restriction site was deleted by site-directed deletion. For the generation of AQP4-mutants, AQP4 CDS cloned into pTarget and pmCherry-N1 were used as a template for single point mutation, using the QuikChange site-directed II kit (Stratagene), according to the manufacturers instructions.

To obtain stable transfected cell lines, cells were transfected and stable clones were selected by G418 treatment. Anti-AQP4 antibodies were from Santa Cruz (Sc-9888). Anti-AQP0 antibodies were from ADI. The secondary antibodies for immunoblotting analysis were peroxidase-conjugated IgGs from Santa Cruz, whereas Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated IgGs were used for immunofluorescence. NMO patients were diagnosed according to Wingercuck's 2006 criteria (8Wingerchuk D.M. Lennon V.A. Pittock S.J. Lucchinetti C.F. Weinshenker B.G.

NMO-1 were those sera showing a predominant role of loop A (residues 61–64), NMO-2 of the tip of the loop C (residues 146–150), and NMO-3 had an equal role as loop A and the tip of the loop.TABLE 321 NMO sera and relative epitope categoriesEpitope categoryNMO seraNMO-12, 3, 5, 8, 15, 17, 19NMO-21, 4, 10, 13, 14, 18, 21NMO-36, 7, 9, 11, 12, 16, 20 Open table in a new tab Briefly, HeLa, V79, or U87MG cells were first fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min, permeabilized with 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min, and finally saturated with PBS added with 0.1% gelatin for 10 min. The incubation with primary and secondary antibodies was performed as previously described (9Pisani F. Sparaneo A. Tortorella C. Ruggieri M. Trojano M. Mola M.G. Nicchia G.P. Frigeri A. Svelto M.

For the immunofluorescence analysis of NMO-IgG binding, unfixed cells were used as previously described (9Pisani F. Sparaneo A. Tortorella C. Ruggieri M. Trojano M. Mola M.G. Nicchia G.P. Frigeri A. Svelto M. Aquaporin-4 autoantibodies in neuromyelitis optica: AQP4 isoform-dependent sensitivity and specificity.PLoS One. 2013; 8: e79185Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In reported cases, PBS, pH 5.5, was used during NMO-IgG binding. For immunofluorescence analysis of oocytes, 3 days after the injection, they were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, 0.1 m sucrose for 4 h at room temperature, cryo-protected in 30% sucrose in PBS at 4 °C overnight, mounted in OCT, and sectioned in 10-µm slices. Immunostained cells were observed with a photomicroscope equipped for epifluorescence (DMRXA; Leica) and digital images were obtained with a DMX 1200 camera (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan). Transfected HeLa or V79 cells were stained with commercial AQP4 antibodies, or NMO serum, as described above, and analyzed as follows. A Nikon laser TIRF setup was used, consisting of a 488-nm argon laser mounted on a Nikon laser TE2000U microscope, which also allows phase-contrast and epifluorescence techniques to be combined with TIRF technology. An incidence angle greater than the critical angle was achieved by the use of a ×100 CFI Plan Apo with a numerical aperture of 1.45. Fluorescence excited by TIR evanescent field ∼100 nm) was collected with the same objective, and images were collected using a cooled charge-coupled device camera (Hamamatsu Orca). The TIRF signal was measured in 10 independent areas of transfected cells. V79 cells stably transfected with AQP4 D69H-mCherry, grown into two 15-cm dishes, were trypsinized, washed twice in PBS, and incubated with 500 µg of purified NMO-IgG (Melon-IgG purification kit) for 1 h at room temperature, with a rotary shaker. Cells were collected by centrifugation (1,500 × g, 5′) at room temperature, the supernatant (NMO-IgG D69H(−)) was recovered and cells were washed twice with PBS. Elution of D69H high affinity NMO-IgG (NMO-IgG D69H(+)), was performed with 1 ml of 0.1 m NaCl, 0.1 m Gly-HCl, pH 2.5, for 10 min at room temperature in a rotary shaker. Immediately after elution, 1/10 volume of 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, was added to the solution to neutralize the pH. Live stable transfected cells were incubated for 1 h in a cell incubator (37 °C, 5% CO2), in Hanks' balanced salt solution (Invitrogen), 5% human complement (Sigma), and human NMO serum (1:50) or purified 50–1600 µg/ml of IgG (by Melon-IgG purification kit) was added. Cells were washed in PBS/Ca2+-Mg2+, and dead cells were stained with 4 µm ethidium homodimer (Invitrogen) in PBS/Ca2+-Mg2+. The percent of dead cells was evaluated by fluorescence microscopy analysis, by counting red-stained nuclei with respect to total cells visualized by phase contrast; 10 independent fields were acquired. Blue Native-PAGE was performed as previously reported (10Pisani F. Mastrototaro M. Rossi A. Nicchia G.P. Tortorella C. Ruggieri M. Trojano M. Frigeri A. Svelto M.

Briefly, cells were lysed into 7–10 volumes of BN buffer (BN buffer: 1% Triton X-100, 12 mm NaCl, 500 mm 6-aminohexanoic acid, 20 mm BisTris, pH 7.0, 2 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol), with added protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostic Gmbh, Mannheim, Germany) on ice vortexing every 10 min for 1 h and centrifuged at 22,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Twenty micrograms of protein sample were mixed with 5% Coomassie Blue G-250 and loaded in polyacrylamide native gradient gels (4–9 or 3–13%). At the end of the run, the gel was blotted onto a PVDF (Millipore, Bedford, MA) membrane for Western blot analysis. X. laevis oocyte preparation, cRNA synthesis, and oocyte injections were performed as described (18Nicchia G.P. Ficarella R. Rossi A. Giangreco I. Nicolotti O. Carotti A. Pisani F. Estivill X.

The mMessage mMachine T7 in vitro transcription kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) was used to produce cRNA from each construct for oocyte injection. cRNAs were injected into single oocytes using an automated microinjector (Nanoject; Drummond Scientific, Broomall, PA), and Pf was measured (18Nicchia G.P.

Cells were seeded on black, clear bottom 96-well plates (Corning) at a density of 12,000 cells/well and used 24 h after plating. 80–85% confluent cells were washed with PBS and incubated at 37 °C for 45 min with 10 µm membrane permeable calcein-AM (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) as previously described (19Mola M.G. Nicchia G.P. Svelto M. Spray D.C. Frigeri A. Automated cell-based assay for screening of aquaporin inhibitors.Anal. Chem. 2009; 81: 8219-8229Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Calcein fluorescence was recorded on a FlexStation3 plate reader equipped with an integrated liquid handling module (Molecular Devices, MDS Analytical Technologies) able to transfer compounds from a source plate to the assay plate during data acquisition. Cells were rinsed in 60 µl of isosmolar PBS and osmotic gradients were applied 15 s after the beginning of each reading by addition of an appropriate volume of mannitol to reach 450 mosmol final osmolarity. Time course fluorescence data following mixing of cells with hyperosmotic solution were recorded over a 90-s period. Data acquisition was performed by SoftMaxPro software, and the data were analyzed using Prism (Graph Pad) software. The time constant of cell shrinkage was obtained by fitting the data to an exponential function. The initial structure of AQP4 was obtained from the Protein Data Bank (PDB entry 3GD8) (20Ho J.D. Yeh R. Sandstrom A. Chorny I. Harries W.E. Robbins R.A. Miercke L.J. Stroud R.M. Crystal structure of human aquaporin 4 at 1.8 Å and its mechanism of conductance.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 7437-7442Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). The obtained crystal was first pretreated using the MAESTRO protein preparation module (version 9.5) (43Schrödinger Maestro. Schrödinger, LLC, New York2013Google Scholar), which enables missing hydrogen atoms to be added and the optimal protonation states for histidine residues to be determined. The simulation system was built as follows. A 120 × 120 Å2 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine bilayer patch was first built using the membrane plug-in for visual molecular dynamics (VMD) (21Humphrey W. Dalke A. Schulten K. VMD: visual molecular dynamics.J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (38418) Google Scholar), with the membrane normal along the z axis. A tetramer of AQP4 was embedded in this bilayer and lipid molecules within 0.8 Å of heavy atoms of the protein were removed. To neutralize the system, 23 Na+ and 19 Cl− ions were added using the visual molecular dynamics autoionized plug-in, generating 100 mm ionic concentration and a final system of 135,833 atoms (number computed for wild type). Both mutated and WT protein structures were incorporated into a periodic box of TIP3P water molecules (22Jorgensen W.L. Chandrasekhar J. Madura J.D. Impey R.W. Klein M.L. Comparison of simple potential functions for simulating liquid water.J. Chem. Phys. 1983; 79: 926-935Crossref Scopus (29892) Google Scholar) extended by 18 Å in each direction from all protein atoms using the Add Solvation Box plug-in of VMD. To consider both tautomeric states of the histidine residue, two different mutated forms were built, namely D69HSD and D69HSE, in which the asparate in position 69 was substituted for histidine with a hydrogen atom at positions δ and ϵ, respectively. All molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed using NAMD 2.9 (23Phillips J.C. Braun R. Wang W. Gumbart J. Tajkhorshid E. Villa E. Chipot C. Skeel R.D. Kalé L. Schulten K. Scalable molecular dynamics with NAMD.J. Comput. Chem. 2005; 26: 1781-1802Crossref PubMed Scopus (13147) Google Scholar) and the CHARMM27 force field (24MacKerell Jr., A.D. Banavali N. Foloppe N. Development and current status of the CHARMM force field for nucleic acids.Biopolymers. 2000; 56: 257-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar). The full system was minimized to remove steric clashes in the initial geometry and gradually heated up to 310 K within 500 ps of MD. The SHAKE algorithm was employed to constrain all R-H bonds. Periodic boundary conditions were applied in all directions. A non-bonded cut-off of 12 Å was used, whereas the Particle-Mesh-Ewald (25Darden T. York D. Pedersen L. Particle mesh Ewald: an N·log(N) method for Ewald sums in large systems.J. Chem. Phys. 1993; 98: 10089-10092Crossref Scopus (20829) Google Scholar) was employed to include the contributions of long-range interactions. All simulations were performed in an isothermal-isobaric ensemble (1 atm, 310 K) with a Nosè–Hoover Langevin barostat (26Martyna G.J. Tobias D.J. Klein M.L.

Generalized Langevin equation approach for atom/solid-surface scattering: general formulation for classical scattering off harmonic solids.J. Chem. Phys. 1976; 64: 2375-2388Crossref Scopus (686) Google Scholar) (damping coefficient 1 ps−1). The time step was set to 2 fs, and coordinates were saved every 5000 steps (10 ps). A MD trajectory of 20 ns was obtained for the wild type and each mutated form. For each investigated system, the equilibration of the structure required less than 5 ns and thus the first 5 ns were removed from the analysis. All simulations were performed on the FERMI supercomputer at CINECA, Italy. Rat brain (cerebral cortex) membrane vesicles and skeletal muscle light microsome vesicles were prepared as reported (39Nicchia G.P. Cogotzi L. Rossi A. Basco D. Brancaccio A. Svelto M. Frigeri A.

https://openalex.org/W2003418613,"Salmonella enterica serovars Derby and Mbandaka are isolated from different groups of livestock species in the UK. S. Derby is predominantly isolated from pigs and turkeys and S. Mbandaka is predominantly isolated from cattle and chickens. Alignment of the genome sequences of two isolates of each serovar led to the discovery of a new putative Salmonella pathogenicity island, SPI-23, in the chromosome sequence of S. Derby isolates. SPI-23 is 37 kb in length and contains 42 ORFs, ten of which are putative type III effector proteins. In this study we use porcine jejunum derived cell line IPEC-J2 and in vitro organ culture of porcine jejunum and colon, to characterise the association and invasion rates of S. Derby and S. Mbandaka, and tissue tropism of S. Derby respectively. We show that S. Derby invades and associates to an IPEC-J2 monolayer in significantly greater numbers than S. Mbandaka, and that S. Derby preferentially attaches to porcine jejunum over colon explants. We also show that nine genes across SPI-23 are up-regulated to a greater degree in the jejunum compared to the colon explants. Furthermore, we constructed a mutant of the highly up-regulated, pilV-like gene, potR, and find that it produces an excess of surface pili compared to the parent strain which form a strong agglutinating phenotype interfering with association and invasion of IPEC-J2 monolayers. We suggest that potR may play a role in tissue tropism."
https://openalex.org/W1974859510,"PIWI proteins play essential and conserved roles in germline development, including germline stem cell maintenance and meiosis. Because germline regulators such as OCT4, NANOG, and SOX2 are known to be potent factors that reprogram differentiated somatic cells into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), we investigated whether the PIWI protein family is involved in iPSC production. We find that all three mouse Piwi genes, Miwi, Mili, and Miwi2, are expressed in embryonic stem cells (ESCs) at higher levels than in fibroblasts, with Mili being the highest. However, mice lacking all three Piwi genes are viable and female fertile, and are only male sterile. Furthermore, embryonic fibroblasts derived from Miwi/Mili/Miwi2 triple knockout embryos can be efficiently reprogrammed into iPS cells. These iPS cells expressed pluripotency markers and were capable of differentiating into all three germ layers in teratoma assays. Genome-wide expression profiling reveals that the triple knockout iPS cells are very similar to littermate control iPS cells. These results indicate that PIWI proteins are dispensable for direct reprogramming of mouse fibroblasts."
https://openalex.org/W2039902595,"A daily diary and two experience sampling studies were carried out to investigate curvilinearity of the within-person relationship between state neuroticism and task performance, as well as the moderating effects of within-person variation in momentary job demands (i.e., work pressure and task complexity). In one, results showed that under high work pressure, the state neuroticism-task performance relationship was best described by an exponentially decreasing curve, whereas an inverted U-shaped curve was found for tasks low in work pressure, while in another study, a similar trend was visible for task complexity. In the final study, the state neuroticism-momentary task performance relationship was a linear one, and this relationship was moderated by momentary task complexity. Together, results from all three studies showed that it is important to take into account the moderating effects of momentary job demands because within-person variation in job demands affects the way in which state neuroticism relates to momentary levels of task performance. Specifically, we found that experiencing low levels of state neuroticism may be most beneficial in high demanding tasks, whereas more moderate levels of state neuroticism are optimal under low momentary job demands."
https://openalex.org/W1969753989,"Blue Angelonia × angustifolia flowers can show spontaneous mutations resulting in white/blue and white flower colourations. In such a white line, a loss of dihydroflavonol 4-reductase (DFR) activity was observed whereas chalcone synthase and flavanone 3-hydroxylase activity remained unchanged. Thus, cloning and characterization of a DFR of Angelonia flowers was carried out for the first time. Two full length DFR cDNA clones, Ang.DFR1 and Ang.DFR2, were obtained from a diploid chimeral white/blue Angelonia × angustifolia which demonstrated a 99% identity in their translated amino acid sequence. In comparison to Ang.DFR2, Ang.DFR1 was shown to contain an extra proline in a proline-rich region at the N-terminus along with two exchanges at the amino acids 12 and 26 in the translated amino acid sequence. The recombinant Ang.DFR2 obtained by heterologous expression in yeast was functionally active catalyzing the NADPH dependent reduction of dihydroquercetin (DHQ) and dihydromyricetin (DHM) to leucocyanidin and leucomyricetin, respectively. Dihydrokaempferol (DHK) in contrast was not accepted as a substrate despite the presence of asparagine in a position assumed to determine DHK acceptance. We show that substrate acceptance testing of DFRs provides biased results for DHM conversion if products are extracted with ethyl acetate. Recombinant Ang.DFR1 was inactive and functional activity could only be restored via exchanges of the amino acids in position 12 and 26 as well as the deletion of the extra proline. E. coli transformation of the pGEX-6P-1 vector harbouring the Ang.DFR2 and heterologous expression in E. coli resulted in functionally active enzymes before and after GST tag removal. Both the GST fusion protein and purified DFR minus the GST tag could be stored at −80°C for several months without loss of enzyme activity and demonstrated identical substrate specificity as the recombinant enzyme obtained from heterologous expression in yeast."
https://openalex.org/W1981890955,"This study was conducted to investigate how the activity and expression of certain paramount antioxidant enzymes respond to grape seed extract (GSE) addition in primary muscle cells of goats. Gluteal primary muscle cells (PMCs) isolated from a 3-week old goat were cultivated as an unstressed cell model, or they were exposed to 100 µM H2O2 to establish a H2O2-stimulated cell model. The activities of catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutases (SOD) and glutathione peroxidases (GPx) in combination with other relevant antioxidant indexes [i.e., reduced glutathione (GSH) and total antioxidant capacity (TAOC)] in response to GSE addition were tested in the unstressed and H2O2-stimulated cell models, and the relative mRNA levels of the CAT, GuZu-SOD, and GPx-1 genes were measured by qPCR. In unstressed PMCs, GSE addition at the dose of 10 µg/ml strikingly attenuated the expression levels of CAT and CuZn-SOD as well as the corresponding enzyme activities. By contrast, in cells pretreated with 100 µM H2O2, the expression and activity levels of these two antioxidant enzymes were enhanced by GSE addition at 10 µg/ml. GSE addition promoted GPx activity in both unstressed and stressed PMCs, while the expression of the GPx 1 gene displayed partial divergence with GPx activity, which was mitigated by GSE addition at 10 µg/ml in unstressed PMCs. GSH remained comparatively stable except for GSE addition to H2O2-stimulated PMCs at 60 µg/ml, in which a dramatic depletion of GSH occurred. Moreover, GSE addition enhanced TAOC in unstressed (but not H2O2-stimulated) PMCs. GSE addition exerted a bidirectional modulating effect on the mRNA levels and activities of CAT and SOD in unstressed and stressed PMCs at a moderate dose, and it only exhibited a unidirectional effect on the promotion of GPx activity, reflecting its potential to improve antioxidant protection in ruminants."
https://openalex.org/W1980241993,"CYP2E1, one of the cytochrome P450 mixed-function oxidases located predominantly in liver, plays a key role in metabolism of xenobiotics including ethanol and procarcinogens. Recently, down-expression of CYP2E1 was found in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with the majority to be chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) carriers. In this study, we tested a hypothesis that HBx may inhibit CYP2E1 gene expression via hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α (HNF4α). By enforced HBx gene expression in cultured HepG2 cells, we determined the effect of HBx on CYP2E1 mRNA and protein expression. With a bioinformatics analysis, we found a consensus HNF-4α binding sequence located on −318 to −294 bp upstream of human CYP2E1 promoter. Using reporter gene assay and site-directed mutagenesis, we have shown that mutation of this site dramatically decreased CYP2E1 promoter activity. By silencing endogenous HNF-4α, we have further validated knockdown of HNF-4α significantly decreased CYP2E1expression. Ectopic overexpression of HBx in HepG2 cells inhibits HNF-4α expression, and HNF-4α levels were inversely correlated with viral proteins both in HBV-infected HepG2215 cells and as well as HBV positive HCC liver tissues. Moreover, the HBx-induced CYP2E1 reduction could be rescued by ectopic supplement of HNF4α protein expression. Furthermore, human hepatoma cells C34, which do not express CYP2E1, shows enhanced cell growth rate compared to E47, which constitutively expresses CYP2E1. In addition, the significantly altered liver proteins in CYP2E1 knockout mice were detected with proteomics analysis. Together, HBx inhibits human CYP2E1 gene expression via downregulating HNF4α which contributes to promotion of human hepatoma cell growth. The elucidation of a HBx-HNF4α-CYP2E1 pathway provides novel insight into the molecular mechanism underlining chronic HBV infection associated hepatocarcinogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2048993354,"We have shown that ex vivo pre-conditioning of bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (DC) with low molecular weight hyaluronan (LMW HA) induces antitumor immunity against colorectal carcinoma (CRC) in mice. In the present study we investigated the effects of LMW HA priming on human-tumor-pulsed monocytes-derived dendritic cells (DC/TL) obtained from healthy donors and patients with CRC. LMW HA treatment resulted in an improved maturation state of DC/TL and an enhanced mixed leucocyte reaction activity in vivo. Importantly, pre-conditioning of DC/TL with LMW HA increased their ability to migrate and reduced their attraction to human tumor derived supernatants. These effects were associated with increased CCR7 expression levels in DC. Indeed, a significant increase in migratory response toward CCL21 was observed in LMW HA primed tumor-pulsed monocyte-derived dendritic cells (DC/TL/LMW HA) when compared to LWM HA untreated cells (DC/TL). Moreover, LMW HA priming modulated other mechanisms implicated in DC migration toward lymph nodes such as the metalloproteinase activity. Furthermore, it also resulted in a significant reduction in DC migratory capacity toward tumor supernatant and IL8 in vitro. Consistently, LMW HA dramatically enhanced in vivo DC recruitment to tumor-regional lymph nodes and reduced DC migration toward tumor tissue. This study shows that LMW HA –a poorly immunogenic molecule- represents a promising candidate to improve human DC maturation protocols in the context of DC-based vaccines development, due to its ability to enhance their immunogenic properties as well as their migratory capacity toward lymph nodes instead of tumors."

SVR was higher in genotype 2 when compared with genotype 3 (64.7% vs. 56.9%, p = 0.004). By multivariate analysis of genotype 2 patients, low baseline γ -GT and RVR predicted SVR. In genotype 3 age ≤45 years, cholesterol>130 mg/dl, a low APRI score, and a γ-GT ≥3-times ULN, RVR, and RBV starting dose were associated with SVR by multivariate analysis.The present study corroborates that liver fibrosis is more pronounced in genotype 3 vs. 2. SVR is higher in genotype 2 versus genotype 3 partly because of follow-up problems in genotype 3 patients, in particular in those infected by drug use. Thus, subgroups of genotype 3 patients have adherence problems and need special attention also because they often have significant liver fibrosis.Verband Forschender Arzneimittelhersteller e.V., Berlin, Germany ML21645 ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02106156."
https://openalex.org/W1980677745,"Background and Objectives Thrombomodulin (TM), an integral membrane glycoprotein expressed on the lumenal surface of vascular endothelial cells, promotes anti-coagulant and anti-inflammatory properties. Release of functional TM from the endothelium surface into plasma has also been reported. Much is still unknown however about how endothelial TM is regulated by physiologic hemodynamic forces (and particularly cyclic strain) intrinsic to endothelial-mediated vascular homeostasis. Methods This study employed human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs) to investigate the effects of equibiaxial cyclic strain (7.5%, 60 cycles/min, 24 hrs), and to a lesser extent, laminar shear stress (10 dynes/cm2, 24 hrs), on TM expression and release. Time-, dose- and frequency-dependency studies were performed. Results Our initial studies demonstrated that cyclic strain strongly downregulated TM expression in a p38- and receptor tyrosine kinase-dependent manner. This was in contrast to the upregulatory effect of shear stress. Moreover, both forces significantly upregulated TM release over a 48 hr period. With continuing focus on the cyclic strain-induced TM release, we noted both dose (0–7.5%) and frequency (0.5–2.0 Hz) dependency, with no attenuation of strain-induced TM release observed following inhibition of MAP kinases (p38, ERK-1/2), receptor tyrosine kinase, or eNOS. The concerted impact of cyclic strain and inflammatory mediators on TM release from HAECs was also investigated. In this respect, both TNFα (100 ng/ml) and ox-LDL (10–50 µg/ml) appeared to potentiate strain-induced TM release. Finally, inhibition of neither MMPs (GM6001) nor rhomboids (3,4-dichloroisocoumarin) had any effect on strain-induced TM release. However, significantly elevated levels (2.1 fold) of TM were observed in isolated microparticle fractions following 7.5% strain for 24 hrs. Conclusions A preliminary in vitro investigation into the effects of cyclic strain on TM in HAECs is presented. Physiologic cyclic strain was observed to downregulate TM expression, whilst upregulating in a time-, dose- and frequency-dependent manner the release of TM."
https://openalex.org/W2003790211,"Homeostatic and adaptive control mechanisms are essential for keeping organisms structurally and functionally stable. Integral feedback is a control theoretic concept which has long been known to keep a controlled variable A robustly (i.e. perturbation-independent) at a given set-point A(set) by feeding the integrated error back into the process that generates A. The classical concept of homeostasis as robust regulation within narrow limits is often considered as unsatisfactory and even incompatible with many biological systems which show sustained oscillations, such as circadian rhythms and oscillatory calcium signaling. Nevertheless, there are many similarities between the biological processes which participate in oscillatory mechanisms and classical homeostatic (non-oscillatory) mechanisms. We have investigated whether biological oscillators can show robust homeostatic and adaptive behaviors, and this paper is an attempt to extend the homeostatic concept to include oscillatory conditions. Based on our previously published kinetic conditions on how to generate biochemical models with robust homeostasis we found two properties, which appear to be of general interest concerning oscillatory and homeostatic controlled biological systems. The first one is the ability of these oscillators (""oscillatory homeostats"") to keep the average level of a controlled variable at a defined set-point by involving compensatory changes in frequency and/or amplitude. The second property is the ability to keep the period/frequency of the oscillator tuned within a certain well-defined range. In this paper we highlight mechanisms that lead to these two properties. The biological applications of these findings are discussed using three examples, the homeostatic aspects during oscillatory calcium and p53 signaling, and the involvement of circadian rhythms in homeostatic regulation."
https://openalex.org/W1989378085,"A plethora of non-coding RNAs has been discovered using high-resolution transcriptomics tools, indicating that transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation is much more complex than previously appreciated. Small RNAs associated with transcription start sites of annotated coding regions (TSSaRNAs) are pervasive in both eukaryotes and bacteria. Here, we provide evidence for existence of TSSaRNAs in several archaeal transcriptomes including: Halobacterium salinarum, Pyrococcus furiosus, Methanococcus maripaludis, and Sulfolobus solfataricus. We validated TSSaRNAs from the model archaeon Halobacterium salinarum NRC-1 by deep sequencing two independent small-RNA enriched (RNA-seq) and a primary-transcript enriched (dRNA-seq) strand-specific libraries. We identified 652 transcripts, of which 179 were shown to be primary transcripts (∼7% of the annotated genome). Distinct growth-associated expression patterns between TSSaRNAs and their cognate genes were observed, indicating a possible role in environmental responses that may result from RNA polymerase with varying pausing rhythms. This work shows that TSSaRNAs are ubiquitous across all domains of life."
https://openalex.org/W2002207189,"Objective The aim of the study is to determine the frequency of parkin allelic variants in Czech early-onset Parkinson's disease patients and healthy controls. Methods A total of 70 early-onset Parkinson's disease patients (age at onset ≤40 years) and 75 controls were screened for the sequence variants and exon rearrangements in the parkin gene. Results Parkin mutations were identified in five patients (7.1%): the p.R334C point mutation was present in one patient, four patients had exon deletions. The detected mutations were observed in the heterozygous state except one homozygous deletion of the exon 4. No mutations were obtained in control subjects. A novel sequence variant p.V380I (c.1138G>A) was identified in one control. Non-pathogenic polymorphisms p.S167N and p.D394N were seen in similar percentage in patients and controls, polymorphism p.V380L was almost twice as frequent in controls as in patients. Conclusions Our study contributes to the growing body of evidence on the low frequency of the parkin mutations in the early-onset Parkinson's disease suggesting the potential role of other genes in the pathogenesis of the disease."
https://openalex.org/W2138199808,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small RNA molecules that play important roles in gene regulation and translational repression. The mechanisms that facilitate miRNA target binding and recognition have been extensively studied in recent years. However, it is still not well known how the miRNA regulation is affected by the location and the flanking sequences of miRNA target sites. In this study, we systematically quantify the contribution of a wide spectrum of target sites on miRNA-mediated gene expression regulation. Our study investigates target sites located in four different gene regions, including 3' untranslated regions, coding sequences, 5' untranslated regions and promoter regions. We have also introduced four additional non-canonical types of seed matches beyond the canonical seed matches, and included them in our study. Computational analysis of quantitative proteomic data has demonstrated that target sites located in different regions impact the miRNA-mediated repression differently but synergistically. In addition, we have shown the synergistic effects among non-canonical seed matches and canonical ones that enhance the miRNA regulatory effects. Further systematic analysis on the site accessibility near the target regions and the secondary structure of the mRNA sequences have demonstrated substantial variations among target sites of different locations and of different types of seed matches, suggesting the mRNA secondary structure could explain some of the difference in the miRNA regulatory effects impacted by these different target sites. Our study implies miRNAs might regulate their targets under different mechanisms when target sites vary in both their locations and the types of seed matches they contain."
https://openalex.org/W1990132014,"Oysters, with high levels of phenotypic plasticity and wide geographic distribution, are a challenging group for taxonomists and phylogenetics. Our study is intended to generate new EST-SNP markers and to evaluate their potential for cross-species utilization in phylogenetic study of the genus Crassostrea. In the study, 57 novel SNPs were developed from an EST database of C. gigas by the HRM (high-resolution melting) method. Transferability of 377 SNPs developed for C. gigas was examined on four other Crassostrea species: C. sikamea, C. angulata, C. hongkongensis and C. ariakensis. Among the 377 primer pairs tested, 311 (82.5%) primers showed amplification in C. sikamea, 353 (93.6%) in C. angulata, 254 (67.4%) in C. hongkongensis and 253 (67.1%) in C. ariakensis. A total of 214 SNPs were found to be transferable to all four species. Phylogenetic analyses showed that C. hongkongensis was a sister species of C. ariakensis and that this clade was sister to the clade containing C. sikamea, C. angulata and C. gigas. Within this clade, C. gigas and C. angulata had the closest relationship, with C. sikamea being the sister group. In addition, we detected eight SNPs as potentially being under selection by two outlier tests (fdist and hierarchical methods). The SNPs studied here should be useful for genetic diversity, comparative mapping and phylogenetic studies across species in Crassostrea and the candidate outlier SNPs are worth exploring in more detail regarding association genetics and functional studies."
https://openalex.org/W1988843008,"Recent qualitative studies indicated that physicians interact with pharmaceutical representatives depending on the relative weight of the benefits to the risks and are also influenced by a variety of experiences and circumstances. However, these studies do not provide enough information about if, when, how and why their attitudes and behaviors change over time.A qualitative study using semi-structured face-to-face individual interviews was conducted on 9 Japanese physicians who attended a symposium on conflicts of interest held in Tokyo. Interviews were designed to explore chronological changes in individual physicians' attitude and behavior concerning relationships with pharmaceutical representatives and factors affecting such changes. Their early interaction with pharmaceutical representatives was passive as physicians were not explicitly aware of the meaning of such interaction. They began to think on their own about how to interact with pharmaceutical representatives as they progressed in their careers. Their attitude toward pharmaceutical representatives changed over time. Factors affecting attitudinal change included work environment (local regulations and job position), role models, views of patients and the public, acquisition of skills in information seeking and evidence-based medicine, and learning about the concepts of professionalism and conflict of interest. However, the change in attitude was not necessarily followed by behavioral change, apparently due to rationalization and conformity to social norms.Physicians' attitudes toward relationships with pharmaceutical representatives changed over time and factors affecting such changes were various. Paying attention to these factors and creating new social norms may be both necessary to produce change in behavior consistent with change in attitude."
https://openalex.org/W2001754473,"Introduction Allergic reaction to dust mites is a relatively common condition among children, triggering cutaneous and respiratory responses that have a great impact on the health of this population. Anaphylactic hypersensitivity is characterized by an exacerbated response involving the production of regulatory cytokines responsible for stimulating the production of IgE antibodies. Objective To investigate an association of variants in cytokine genes (IL1A−889, IL1B−511, +3962, IL1R1970, IL1RA11100, IL4RA+1902, IL12−1188, IFNG+874, TGFB1codon 10, codon 25, TNFA−308, −238, IL2−330, +166, IL4−1098, −590, −33, IL6−174, nt565, and IL10−1082, −819, −592) between patients sensitive to dust mites and a control group. Methods A total of 254 patients were grouped as atopic and non-atopic according to sensitivity as evaluated by the Prick Test and to cytokine genotyping by the polymerase chain reaction-sequence specific primers (PCR-SSP) method using the Cytokine Genotyping Kit. Results A comparison between individuals allergic to Dermatophagoides farinae, Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus, and Blomia tropicalis and a non-atopic control group showed significant differences between allele and genotype frequencies in the regulatory regions of cytokine genes, with important evidence for IL4−590 in T/C (10.2% vs. 43.1%, odd ratio [OR] = 0.15, p = 5.2 10−8, pc = 0.0000011, and 95% confidence interval [95%CI] = 0.07–0.32) and T/T genotypes (42.9% vs. 13.8%, OR = 4.69, p = 2.5 10−6, pc = 0.000055, and 95%CI = 2.42–9.09). Other associations were observed in the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL1A−889 (T/T, C, and T) and IL2−330 (G/T and T/T) and the anti-inflammatory cytokines IL4RA+1902 (A and G), IL4−590 (T/C, T/T, C, and T), and IL10−592 (A/A, C/A, A, and C). Conclusion Our results suggest a possible association between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in cytokine genes and hypersensitivity to dust mites."
https://openalex.org/W2076387564,"We have been investigating whether xBmal1 and xNocturnin play a role in somitogenesis, a cyclic developmental process with an ultradian period. Previous work from our lab shows that circadian genes (xPeriod1, xPeriod2, xBmal1, and xNocturnin) are expressed in developing somites. Somites eventually form the vertebrae, muscles of the back, and dermis. In Xenopus, a pair of somites is formed about every 50 minutes from anterior to posterior. We were intrigued by the co-localization of circadian genes in an embryonic tissue known to be regulated by an ultradian clock. Cyclic expression of genes involved in Notch signaling has been implicated in the somite clock. Disruption of Notch signaling in humans has been linked to skeletal defects in the vertebral column. We found that both depletion (morpholino) and overexpression (mRNA) of xBMAL1 protein (bHLH transcription factor) or xNOCTURNIN protein (deadenylase) on one side of the developing embryo led to a significant decrease in somite number with respect to the untreated side (p<0.001). These manipulations also significantly affect expression of a somite clock component (xESR9; p<0.05). We observed opposing effects on somite size. Depletion of xBMAL1 or xNOCTURNIN caused a statistically significant decrease in somite area (quantified using NIH ImageJ; p<0.002), while overexpression of these proteins caused a significant dose dependent increase in somite area (p<0.02; p<0.001, respectively). We speculate that circadian genes may play two separate roles during somitogenesis. Depletion and overexpression of xBMAL1 and NOCTURNIN both decrease somite number and influence expression of a somite clock component, suggesting that these proteins may modulate the timing of the somite clock in the undifferentiated presomitic mesoderm. The dosage dependent effects on somite area suggest that xBMAL1 and xNOCTURNIN may also act during somite differentiation to promote myogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2108743786,"FLICE/caspase-8-associated huge protein (FLASH)/casp8ap2 is involved in various cellular functions, such as cell cycle progression, transcriptional regulation, the regulation of apoptosis, and the regulation of histone gene expression. The down-regulated expression of FLASH has been shown to inhibit cell cycle progression in the S phase in many kinds of mice and human cell lines and the inhibition of cell cycle progression may be attributed to the suppressed expression of replication-dependent histone genes. We here demonstrated that the induced knockout of FLASH never affected cell cycle progression in ES cells, in which the expression of core histone genes was decreased to levels similar to those in human KB cells sensitive to the knockdown of FLASH. In addition, the FLASH conditional knockout ES cells could differentiate normally into not only mesodermal and endodermal cells, but also trophoblasts. In order to investigate the function of FLASH in early embryogenesis in vivo, we also examined a FLASH mutant mouse, in which FLASH mutant allele did not express FLASH mRNA in embryos and most adult organs, except for the testis. FLASH mutant embryos died between E3.5 and E8.5. Furthermore, the in vitro cultivation of FLASH mutant embryos generated by in vitro fertilization showed embryonic lethality at the pre-implantation stage by inhibiting the hatching of embryos and their adherence to substrates. Taken together, these results indicate that FLASH plays an important role in early embryogenesis, but is not essential for either the proliferation or differentiation of ES cells."
https://openalex.org/W2003722674,"Revocation functionality is necessary and crucial to identity-based cryptosystems. Revocable identity-based encryption (RIBE) has attracted a lot of attention in recent years, many RIBE schemes have been proposed in the literature but shown to be either insecure or inefficient. In this paper, we propose a new scalable RIBE scheme with decryption key exposure resilience by combining Lewko and Waters' identity-based encryption scheme and complete subtree method, and prove our RIBE scheme to be semantically secure using dual system encryption methodology. Compared to existing scalable and semantically secure RIBE schemes, our proposed RIBE scheme is more efficient in term of ciphertext size, public parameters size and decryption cost at price of a little looser security reduction. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first construction of scalable and semantically secure RIBE scheme with constant size public system parameters."
https://openalex.org/W2036967818,"P-glycoprotein (Pgp) extrudes a large variety of chemotherapeutic drugs from the cells, causing multidrug resistance (MDR). The UIC2 monoclonal antibody recognizes human Pgp and inhibits its drug transport activity. However, this inhibition is partial, since UIC2 binds only to 10-40% of cell surface Pgps, while the rest becomes accessible to this antibody only in the presence of certain substrates or modulators (e.g. cyclosporine A (CsA)). The combined addition of UIC2 and 10 times lower concentrations of CsA than what is necessary for Pgp inhibition when the modulator is applied alone, decreased the EC50 of doxorubicin (DOX) in KB-V1 (Pgp+) cells in vitro almost to the level of KB-3-1 (Pgp-) cells. At the same time, UIC2 alone did not affect the EC50 value of DOX significantly. In xenotransplanted severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice co-treated with DOX, UIC2 and CsA, the average weight of Pgp+ tumors was only ∼10% of the untreated control and in 52% of these animals we could not detect tumors at all, while DOX treatment alone did not decrease the weight of Pgp+ tumors. These data were confirmed by visualizing the tumors in vivo by positron emission tomography (PET) based on their increased 18FDG accumulation. Unexpectedly, UIC2+DOX treatment also decreased the size of tumors compared to the DOX only treated animals, as opposed to the results of our in vitro cytotoxicity assays, suggesting that immunological factors are also involved in the antitumor effect of in vivo UIC2 treatment. Since UIC2 binding itself did not affect the viability of Pgp expressing cells, but it triggered in vitro cell killing by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), it is concluded that the impressive in vivo anti-tumor effect of the DOX-UIC2-CsA treatment is the combined result of Pgp inhibition and antibody dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC)."
https://openalex.org/W2046948827,"The upstream stimulatory factor 2 (USF2) is a regulator of important cellular processes and is supposed to have also a role during tumor development. However, the knowledge about the mechanisms that control the function of USF2 is limited. The data of the current study show that USF2 function is regulated by phosphorylation and identified GSK3β as an USF2-phosphorylating kinase. The phosphorylation sites within USF2 could be mapped to serine 155 and threonine 230. In silico analyses of the 3-dimensional structure revealed that phosphorylation of USF2 by GSK3β converts it to a more open conformation which may influence transactivity, DNA binding and target gene expression. Indeed, experiments with GSK-3β-deficient cells revealed that USF2 transactivity, DNA binding and target gene expression were reduced upon lack of GSK3β. Further, experiments with USF2 variants mimicking GSK3β phosphorylated USF2 in GSK3β-deficient cells showed that phosphorylation of USF2 by GSK3β did not affect cell proliferation but increased cell migration. Together, this study reports a new mechanism by which USF2 may contribute to cancerogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2057082748,"During quorum sensing in the plant pathogen Pantoea stewartii subsp. stewartii, EsaI, an acyl-homoserine lactone (AHL) synthase, and the transcription factor EsaR coordinately control capsular polysaccharide production. The capsule is expressed only at high cell density when AHL levels are high, leading to inactivation of EsaR. In lieu of detailed structural information, the precise mechanism whereby EsaR recognizes AHL and is hindered by it, in a response opposite to that of most other LuxR homologues, remains unresolved. Hence, a random mutagenesis genetic approach was designed to isolate EsaR* variants that are immune to the effects of AHL. Error-prone PCR was used to generate the desired mutants, which were subsequently screened for their ability to repress transcription in the presence of AHL. Following sequencing, site-directed mutagenesis was used to generate all possible mutations of interest as single, rather than multiple amino acid substitutions. Eight individual amino acids playing a critical role in the AHL-insensitive phenotype have been identified. The ability of EsaR* variants to bind AHL and the effect of individual substitutions on the overall conformation of the protein were examined through in vitro assays. Six EsaR* variants had a decreased ability to bind AHL. Fluorescence anisotropy was used to examine the relative DNA binding affinity of the final two EsaR* variants, which retained some AHL binding capability but remained unresponsive to it, perhaps due to an inability of the N-terminal domain to transduce information to the C-terminal domain."
