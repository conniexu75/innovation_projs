Four new metabolites of adrenal hormones have been isolated from human urine after ACTH administration and identified by isotopic dilution after a tracer dose of hydrocortisone-4-C14. The compounds obtained were (1) pregnane3ar,llp, 17o(,20a,21-pentol; (2) 3a, 1701,20a,21-tetra- hydroxypregnane-11-one; (3) pregnane-3a!, lip ,17a ,208,21-pentol; (4) 3ar, 17~~) 2Op ,21-tetrahydroxypregnane-1 l-one. Trivial names were sug- gested for these products. 2. On the basis of the isotopic dilution studies it was estimated that these compounds represent a minimum of 30 per cent of the metabolites of hydrocortisone found in the neutral ether-soluble extract of human urine after hydrolysis of their conjugates by means of beef liver @-glu- curonidase. 3. 3a, 17ar ,2Oa!, 21-Tetrahydroxypregnane-11-one was isolated from human urine after administration of 100 mg. of cortisone-t by vein. It was estimated that the metabolite represented about 6 per cent of radio- activity in the neutral ether-soluble fraction after hydrolysis by means of beef liver p-glucuronidase. 4. A novel and efficient synthesis for 3a, 17a,20a,21-tetrahydroxy- pregnane-11-one was described. The procedure is based upon the solvoly- sis of 3~r, 17a( ,21-triacetoxy-20P-p-toluenesulfonoxypregnane-ll-one with aqueous acetic acid in the presence of potassium acetate. The reaction is an example of “neighboring group effect ” in an acetyl migration with inversion of configuration. 5. The preparation of the related compounds, 3a,21-diacetoxy-17a-hy- droxy-20P-p-toluenesulfonoxypregnane-11-one, 3a,21-diacetoxy-17~u, ~OLU- epoxypregnane-11-one, and pregnane-3oL, llfl ,17ar ,2Oa! ,21 -pentol has been described. The authors express their gratitude to their colleagues Dr. Leon Hellman and Dr. Olaf Pearson for their cooperation in the studies with patients. We are especially indebted to Evelyn Meyer for technical assistance and to Friederike Herling for her valuable contributions to the interpretation of the infra-red spectra."

Such experiments are in progress and will be reported in due course. A recent publication by Armstrong2, in which it was shown that the administration of N-ethylglycocyamine (negmine) was followed by the urinary excretion of N-ethyl-glycocyamidine (negmidine), suggested that a phosphorylation reaction may have been involved. It was therefore of interest to determine whether negmine could be phosphorylated by the creatine phosphokinase system."

This is present in all Malus species examined, together with smaller amounts of the corresponding aglycone phloretin, a quercetin glycoside1, and traces only of chlorogenic acid and epicatechin. Pear leaf, in contrast, contains three phenolics in quantity: chlorogenic and isochlorogenie acids2 and the glucoside arbutin, with small amounts of catechin, epicatechin, flavonol glycosides and hydroquinone, the aglycone of arbutin."

Several workers have reported the lysis of bacteria (Eubacteria) by species of Myxobaeteria; but no satisfactory evidence has been produced that living cells are attacked. It has been shown by Singh1, who used a large number of strains of bacteria, that certain species of Myxococcaceae undoubtedly cause lysis of both Gram-positive and Gram-negative living bacteria upon solid media. Oxford and Singh2 and Oxford3 have shown that a strain of Myxococcus virescens growing on cell-free medium is able to produce two substances, an exo-cellular lytic (proteolytic) enzyme and an antibiotic. Noren4 has confirmed and extended this work to other species of Myxobacteria and has devised more suitable media for the production of the proteolytic enzyme and the antibiotic. The present work deals with the lysis of human pathogenic bacteria by two species of Myxococcus."

This aspect of the problem was about to be abandoned when a paper by Fabergé1 on the use of snail stomach cytase for maceration in cytology was discovered. There appears to be a general lack of knowledge of this method and its advantages. Manton2, for example, makes no mention of it."

These are commonly dried on the specimen support film, and the unwanted salt crystals are removed by washing, with resultant uncertainties due to loss of material during the process, which losses may well be selective. The salts are sometimes first removed from the suspensions by dialysis; but this may lead to changes in aggregation, or to loss by precipitation before the material can be finally laid down."

https://openalex.org/W2078958887,"4-HYDROXYisoPHTHALIC acid is a by-product of the manufacture of salicylic acid by the Kolbe–Schmitt reaction and has been found to be a major constituent of the ‘brown dust’ residues from the sublimation process for the purification of salicylic acid1. Analysis of a typical sample of ‘brown dust’ showed it to contain 10 per cent of salicylic, 82 per cent of 4-hydroxyisophthalic and 3 per cent of 2-hydroxyisophthalic acids, together with some inorganic material. From this source there is thus potentially available a considerable quantity of 4-hydroxyisophthalic acid, the chemistry of which is being investigated as part of a research programme on the Kolbe–Schmitt reaction at the Chemical Research Laboratory2. From a consideration of its structural similarity to salicylic acid, it was suggested at the Chemical Research Laboratory that 4-hydroxyisophthalic acid might also possess similar pharmacological properties. Accordingly, in February 1954, a pharmacological investigation was initiated at Ware and, since the findings were favourable, biochemical studies were also undertaken."

https://openalex.org/W2082074446,"Rowson, Lamming and Fry1 and Lamming and Rowson2 have reported that purulent infections rapidly become established in the uterus of the cow following introduction into the uterus of infected bull semen or cultures of C.pyogenes during the luteal phase of the œstrous cycle, but infections introduced into the uterus of cows in œstrus fail to become established. Using ovariectomized cows, the resistance and susceptibility of the bovine uterus to infection was shown to be due to the action of œstrogens and progesterone respectively. The possibilities suggested to account for the variation in resistance to infection include: (a) an increase in leucocyte activity during œstrus, (b) an increase in antibody activity during œstrus, (c) the production in the uterus during the luteal phase of an environment suitable for rapid bacterial development. The present work is concerned with the effects of the uterine environment."

These changes, which are irreversible, include a decrease in thickness and pore diameter when the membranes are re-equilibrated in water (Table 1). Membranes dried in this way and stored in the dark in contact with one another in a weighing bottle 2 in. diam. × 3 in. height tend to coalesce and decompose after long periods of storage. Membranes of low porosity are not easily re-wetted with water after being dry for several days. ‘Gradocol’ membranes may be dried by the method outlined below and stored for long periods without impairment of their characteristics."

In the course of investigations into the effects and components of various animal venoms, it was noted that eel serum contained a substance which causes a delayed, slow contraction of the isolated guinea pig ileum and bears some resemblance to the substances producing slow contractions present in wasp venom2 or appearing in cat plasma after intravenous injection of thalassine3."
