https://openalex.org/W1968124094,"The primary structures of human neuronal alpha 1, alpha 2, and beta subunits of a voltage-dependent Ca2+ channel were deduced by characterizing cDNAs. The alpha 1 subunit (alpha 1D) directs the recombinant expression of a dihydropyridine-sensitive L-type Ca2+ channel when coexpressed with the beta (beta 2) and the alpha 2 (alpha 2b) subunits in Xenopus oocytes. The recombinant channel is also reversibly blocked by 10-15 microM omega-conotoxin. Expression of the alpha 1D subunit alone, or coexpression with the alpha 2b subunit, did not elicit functional Ca2+ channel activity. Thus, the beta 2 subunit appears to serve an obligatory function, whereas the alpha 2b subunit appears to play an accessory role that potentiates expression of the channel. The primary transcripts encoding the alpha 1D, alpha 2, and beta subunits are differentially processed. At least two forms of neuronal alpha 1D were identified. Different forms of alpha 2 and beta transcripts were also identified in CNS, skeletal muscle, and aorta tissues."
https://openalex.org/W1548600249,"Antibodies were made to synthetic peptides corresponding to sequences specific to the glutamate receptor (GluR) subunits, GluR1-4. The specificity of the antibodies was established by Western blotting using membranes of simian kidney cells (COS-7) transfected with GluR subunit DNA. Four antibodies were found to be selective for each of the four GluR subunits, and a fifth antibody recognized both GluR2 and 3. All five antibodies immunoadsorbed Triton X-100-solubilized rat brain [3H]AMPA binding activity and labeled an Mr = 108,000 band in samples of rat brain. The structure of the Triton X-100-solubilized GluR was studied using subunit-specific antibodies covalently attached to protein A-agarose and analyzing GluR subunits bound to the antibodies by Western blotting. Each of the four subunit-specific antibodies immunoadsorbed its respective GluR subunit as well as the other three forms of GluR, showing that the detergent solubilized GluR exists as hetero-oligomers composed of two or more of the four subunits. Evidence supporting a similar structure for membrane bound GluR was obtained using synaptic membranes chemically cross-linked with dithiobis(succinimidylpropionate). GluR was immunoaffinity-purified using the GluR2 and 3-selective antibody. This antibody, covalently attached to protein A-agarose, adsorbed 55% of [3H]AMPA binding activity, and after elution with 1 M KSCN, 22-37% of the binding activity was recovered. Analysis of the purified product showed a major immunoreactive band at Mr = 108,000, and silver staining identified the same major band and no additional polypeptides. The GluR receptor complex, therefore, appears to be made up exclusively of GluR1-4. In the purified GluR preparation, in addition to the Mr = 108,000 band, three higher molecular weight immunoreactive components were also detected. These bands migrated at Mr = 325,000, 470,000, and 590,000. Similar sized proteins were seen in the cross-linked synaptic membrane sample, with the Mr = 590,000 component being substantially enriched after cross-linking. The Mr = 590,000 band is the largest component detected, and it has a size consistent with its being a pentamer of the Mr = 108,000 protein."

We now provide evidence for a major early onset FAD locus on the long arm of chromosome 14 near the markers D14S43 and D14S53 (multipoint lod score áº‘ = 23.4) and suggest that the inheritance of FAD may be more complex than had initially been suspected."

https://openalex.org/W2005491437,"The Ca2+ permeability of a nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) in the rat CNS was determined using both current and fluorescence measurements on medial habenula neurons. The elementary slope conductance of the nAChR channel was 11 pS in pure external Ca2+ (100 mM) and 42 pS in standard solution. Ca2+ influx through nAChRs resulted in the rise of cytosolic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) to the micromolar range. This increase was maximal under voltage conditions (below -50 mV) in which Ca2+ influx through voltage-activated channels was minimal. Ca2+ influx through nAChRs directly activated a Ca(2+)-dependent Cl- conductance. In addition, it caused a decrease in the GABAA response that outlasted the rise in [Ca2+]i. These results underscore the physiological significance of Ca2+ influx through nAChR channel in the CNS."

https://openalex.org/W2009173102,"Recombinant human ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) was infused for 2 weeks into the lateral ventricle of fimbria-fornix transected adult rats, and its effects were compared with those of purified mouse nerve growth factor (NGF). We provide evidence that CNTF can prevent degeneration and atrophy of almost all injured medial septum neurons (whereas NGF protects only the cholinergic ones). CNTF is also involved in up-regulation of immunostainable low affinity NGF receptor (LNGFR) in cholinergic medial septum and neostriatal neurons and in a population of lateral septum neurons. In contrast to NGF, CNTF did not stimulate choline acetyltransferase in the lesioned septum and normal neostriatum (pointing to different mechanisms for the regulation of choline acetyltransferase and LNGFR), cause hypertrophy of septal or neostriatal cholinergic neurons, or cause sprouting of LNGFR-positive (cholinergic) septal fibers."
https://openalex.org/W1516936296,"Activation of human monocytes results in the production of interstitial collagenase through a prostaglandin E2 (PGE2)-cAMP-dependent pathway. Inasmuch as interleukin 4 (IL-4) has been shown to inhibit PGE2 synthesis by monocytes, we examined the effect of IL-4 on the production of human monocyte interstitial collagenase. Additionally, we also assessed the effect of IL-4 on the production of 92-kDa type IV collagenase/gelatinase and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1) by monocytes. The inhibition of PGE2 synthesis by IL-4 resulted in decreased interstitial collagenase protein and activity that could be restored by exogenous PGE2 or dibutyryl cyclic AMP (Bt2cAMP). IL-4 also suppressed ConA-stimulated 92-kDa type IV collagenase/gelatinase protein and zymogram enzyme activity that could be reversed by exogenous PGE2 or Bt2cAMP. Moreover, indomethacin suppressed the ConA-induced production of 92-kDa type IV collagenase/gelatinase. These data demonstrate that, like monocyte interstitial collagenase, the conA-inducible monocyte 92-kDa type IV collagenase/gelatinase is regulated through a PGE2-mediated cAMP-dependent pathway. In contrast to ConA stimulation, unstimulated monocytes released low levels of 92-kDa type IV collagenase/gelatinase that were not affected by IL-4, PGE2, or Bt2cAMP, indicating that basal production of this enzyme is PGE2-cAMP independent. IL-4 inhibition of both collagenases was not a result of increased TIMP expression since Western analysis of 28.5-kDa TIMP-1 revealed that IL-4 did not alter the increased TIMP-1 protein in response to ConA. These data indicate that IL-4 may function in natural host regulation of connective tissue damage by monocytes."

https://openalex.org/W1504432233,"Gq mediates hormonal stimulation of phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC). We mutated the alpha subunit of Gq (alpha q) to replace arginine 183 with cysteine. Mutations that substitute cysteine for the corresponding arginine residues of alpha s and alpha i2 constitutively activate their respective effector pathways, creating the gsp and gip2 oncogenes. Transient expression of alpha q-R183C in COS-7 and HEK-293 cells constitutively activates PI-PLC, but wild type (WT) alpha q does not. This suggests that the mutated arginines in alpha s, alpha i2, and alpha q share a common function in regulating the active state of these proteins and that the alpha q gene may serve as a target for oncogenic mutations in human tumors. In an attempt to develop an assay for receptor stimulation of recombinant alpha q, we co-expressed receptors with alpha q-WT. We found that the alpha 2-adrenoceptor stimulates PI-PLC activation in HEK-293 cells in a fashion that depends completely on co-expression of alpha q-WT. These findings create an experimental model, similar to that provided for alpha s by S49 cyc- cells, that should make it possible to analyze receptor and effector coupling by mutant alpha q against a null background."
https://openalex.org/W2095357890,"The shutoff of the phototransduction cascade in retinal rods requires the inactivation of light-activated rhodopsin. The underlying mechanisms were studied in functionally intact detached rod outer segments by testing the effect of either sangivamycin, an inhibitor of rhodopsin kinase, or phytic acid, an inhibitor of 48K protein binding to phosphorylated rhodopsin, on light responses recorded in whole-cell voltage clamp. The results suggest that isomerized rhodopsin is inactivated fully by multiple phosphorylation and that the binding of 48K protein accelerates recovery by quenching partially phosphorylated rhodopsin. Higher concentrations of sangivamycin cause changes in the light response that cannot be explained by selective inhibition of rhodopsin kinase and suggest that other protein kinases are needed for normal rod function."
https://openalex.org/W2037384321,"Type IIA rat brain Na+ channel alpha subunits were expressed in CHO cells by nuclear microinjection or by transfection using a vector containing both metallothionein and bacteriophage SP6 promoters. Stable cell lines expressing Na+ channels were isolated, and whole-cell Na+ currents of 0.9-14 nA were recorded. The mean level of whole-cell Na+ current (4.5 nA) corresponds to a cell surface density of approximately 2 channels active at the peak of the Na+ current per microns 2, a density comparable to that observed in the cell bodies of central neurons. The expressed Na+ channels had the voltage dependence, rapid activation and inactivation, and rapid recovery from inactivation characteristic of Na+ channels in brain neurons, bound toxins at neurotoxin receptor sites 1 and 3 with normal properties, and were posttranslationally processed to a normal mature size of 260 kd. Expression of Na+ channel cDNA in CHO cells driven by the metallothionein promoter accurately and efficiently reproduces native Na+ channel properties and provides a method for combined biochemical and physiological analysis of Na+ channel structure and function."

https://openalex.org/W2057906214,"Previous studies have identified two components of whole-cell Ca2+ current in bovine chromaffin cells. The ""standard"" component was activated by single depolarizations, while ""facilitation"" could be activated by large prepulses or repetitive depolarizations. Neither current component was sensitive to changes in holding potential between -100 and -50 mV; thus neither appeared to be carried by N-type Ca2+ channels. We now report that the facilitation Ca2+ current is insensitive to omega-conotoxin GVIA (omega-CgTx), but that the toxin blocks approximately 50% of the standard Ca2+ current. In some cells the toxin blocks all of the standard Ca2+ current, in others about half of the current, while in others it has no effect. Kinetic differences in current activation are observed after toxin application. These results suggest that the standard component of chromaffin cell Ca2+ current is composed of two pharmacologically distinct channels-one is omega-CgTx sensitive and the other is not. Two kinetically distinct types of 14 pS Ca2+ channels that may correspond to the omega-CgTx-sensitive and -insensitive components were observed in single-channel experiments. Because omega-CgTx blocked Ca2+ channels that were not inactivated by a depolarized holding potential, the commonly used Ca2+ channel categorization scheme may be inadequate to describe the Ca2+ channels found in chromaffin cells."
https://openalex.org/W1532619203,"The minimal functional Na,K-ATPase unit is composed of a catalytic alpha-subunit and a glycosylated beta-subunit. So far three putative beta-isoforms have been described, but only beta 1-isoforms have been identified clearly as part of a purified active enzyme complex. In this study we provide evidence that a putative beta 3-isoform might be the functional component of Xenopus oocyte Na,K-ATPase. beta 3-isoforms are expressed in the oocyte plasma membrane together with alpha-subunits, but beta 3-isoforms are synthesized to a lesser extent than alpha-subunits. The unassembled oocyte alpha-subunits accumulate in an immature trypsin-sensitive form most likely in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Injection of both beta 1- and beta 3-cRNA into oocytes abolishes the transport constraint of the oocyte alpha-subunit, renders it trypsin-resistant, and finally leads to an increased number of functional pumps at the plasma membrane. In addition, beta 3-isoforms as beta 1-isoforms depend on the concomitant synthesis of alpha-subunits to be able to leave the ER and to become fully glycosylated. Finally, alpha-beta 1 and alpha-beta 3 complexes expressed at the plasma membrane appear to have similar transport properties as assessed by ouabain binding, rubidium uptake, and electrophysiological measurements in oocytes coexpressing exogenous alpha 1- and beta 1- or beta 3-isoforms. Thus our data indicate that beta 3-isoforms have functional qualities similar to beta 1-isoforms. They can assemble and impose a structural reorganization to newly synthesized alpha-subunits which permits the exit from the ER and the expression of functional Na,K-pumps at the plasma membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1577169945,"In uninduced cells, the NF-kappa B transcription factor resides in the cytoplasm in complex with an inhibitory protein, I kappa B. I kappa B is a specific inhibitor of DNA binding and apparently prevents nuclear uptake of NF-kappa B. Stimulation of cells, for instance with the cytokine tumor necrosis factor, releases I kappa B and allows nuclear translocation and DNA binding of NF-kappa B to regulatory DNA sequences in many genes. We recently reported on the purification of a major form of I kappa B, referred to as I kappa B-alpha, with a molecular size of 37 kDa. Here, we purified and characterized I kappa B-beta, a chromatographically distinct second form of I kappa B. I kappa B-beta has a size of 43 kDa and, as I kappa B-alpha, an acidic isoelectric point between 4.8 and 5.0. Both forms of I kappa B were inactivated by a treatment with protein kinases A and C in vitro. In contrast to I kappa B-alpha, I kappa B-beta lost its inhibiting activity upon a treatment with phosphatase. Phosphatase treatment also released active NF-kappa B from its inactive complex with I kappa B-beta suggesting that the activation of NF-kappa B in intact cells might not only rely on phosphate transfer onto I kappa B but also on phosphate removal from one form of I kappa B."
https://openalex.org/W1669775058,"The mRNA encoding ribosomal protein L32 redistributes from untranslated subribosomal particles into polysomes after mitogenic activation of quiescent T-lymphocytes and fibroblasts. To identify the regions of the L32 mRNA which are important in regulating its cytoplasmic location we constructed a plasmid containing the murine L32 cDNA under the control of the Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) long terminal repeat promoter and introduced this construct into murine 3T3 fibroblasts. The mRNA transcribed from the RSV-L32 construct redistributed from subribosomal particles into polysomes in response to mitogenic activation in a manner similar to endogenous L32 mRNA. A conserved polypyrimidine region present at the 5' terminus of all ribosomal protein mRNAs is required for translational regulation of L32 mRNA since deletion of this sequence resulted in a mRNA that was not sequestered in subribosomal particles in quiescent cells. A radioactive RNA probe containing the first 34 nucleotides of the L32 5'-untranslated region, including the polypyrimidine region, specifically interacted with a protein of about 56 kDa. This protein did not bind detectably to RNA probes lacking the polypyrimidine sequence. Binding activity was similar in protein extracts made from resting and activated cells, suggesting that binding of the 56-kDa protein as measured in this assay is not regulated. This protein is a member of what may be an emerging family of polyribopyrimidine-binding proteins with diverse biochemical functions."
https://openalex.org/W1602069100,"Purified Rad3 protein from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a single-stranded DNA-dependent ATPase and also acts as a DNA helicase on partially duplex DNA. In this study we show that the DNA helicase activity is inhibited when a partially duplex circular DNA substrate is exposed to ultraviolet (UV) radiation. Inhibition of DNA helicase activity is sensitive to the particular strand of the duplex region which carries the damage. Inhibition is retained if the single-stranded circle is irradiated prior to annealing to an unirradiated oligonucleotide, but not if a UV-irradiated oligonucleotide is annealed to unirradiated circular single-stranded DNA. UV irradiation of single-stranded DNA or deoxyribonucleotide homopolymers also inhibits the ability of these polynucleotides to support the hydrolysis of ATP by Rad3 protein. UV radiation damage apparently blocks translocation of Rad3 protein and results in the formation of stable Rad3 protein-UV-irradiated DNA complexes. As a consequence, Rad3 protein remains sequestered on DNA, presumably at sites of base damage. The sensitivity of Rad3 protein to the presence of DNA damage on the strand along which it translocates provides a potential mechanism for damage recognition during nucleotide excision repair and may explain the absolute requirement for Rad3 protein for damage-specific incision of DNA in yeast."

https://openalex.org/W1496063181,"The enzyme 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO) catalyzes the first two steps in the metabolism of arachidonic acid to leukotrienes, substances which play pivotal roles both in normal host defense and in pathologic states of inflammation. Recent studies in granulocytic cells have shown that activation of 5-LO involves its Ca(2+)-dependent translocation from cytosol to membrane compartments. However, little information exists about the molecular regulation of 5-LO in macrophages, even though these cells comprise the resident effector cell population of most organs. We therefore examined the levels of 5-LO activity and immunoreactive protein in cytosol and membrane fractions of resident rat alveolar (AM) and peritoneal macrophages (PM) and compared them with the well studied human neutrophil (polymorphonuclear leukocyte). In the resting state, PM resembled polymorphonuclear leukocyte in that most of their cell-free 5-LO activity, as well as protein content, were localized to the cytosol fraction. By contrast, resting AM contained most of their activity and almost half of their immunoreactive protein in the crude membrane fraction. The inability of the drug MK-886 to reverse this membrane association suggested that the 5-LO-activating protein was not the site of binding in the resting cell; however, this drug completely inhibited leukotriene B4 synthesis in ionophore A23187-stimulated AM, indicating that an interaction between 5-LO and 5-LO-activating protein was nonetheless required for product synthesis upon stimulation. Translocation of cytosolic 5-LO protein could not be convincingly demonstrated in A23187-stimulated AM, suggesting that the pool of 5-LO enzyme responsible for product formation originated in the membrane rather than the cytosol fraction of the resting cell. The AM therefore represents the first mammalian cell in which 5-LO has been recovered from the membrane fraction (a) of a resting cell and (b) in active form. These novel findings extend our understanding of the molecular regulation of 5-LO and may be of importance in designing strategies to limit inflammation in the lung and other sites."
https://openalex.org/W1504118827,"This study was undertaken to evaluate the role of internalization in the action of the peptide autacoid bradykinin (BK). At 4 degrees C [3H]BK binds to an apparently single class of B2 kinin receptors on DDT1 MF-2 smooth muscle cells (C. M. Munoz, S. Cotecchia, and L. M. F. Leeb-Lundberg, manuscript submitted). At this temperature the [3H]BK binding was confined exclusively to the cell surface. On the other hand, at 37 degrees C the B2 receptor-specific cell surface [3H]BK binding was rapidly followed by a receptor-specific internalization of [3H]BK (t1/2 approximately 9 min). The internalization reached a steady-state level after 30-40 min that was 80-100% of the level of specifically bound [3H]BK on the cell surface at 4 degrees C, and this level was maintained for greater than or equal to 2 h. Internalized [3H]BK was routed via at least two intracellular degradative pathways which were distinguished primarily based on subcellular localization but also on a small but significant difference in the rate of [3H]BK degradation. One pathway was localized in a plasma membrane-enriched fraction and had a relatively high degradative capacity. Another pathway was localized in a microsomal fraction and had a relatively low degradative capacity. The internalized [3H]BK activity was rapidly released into the media (t1/2 approximately 24 min). Following a single round of internalization, the released activity consisted almost exclusively of small [3H]BK fragments (less than [3H]BK(1-5)). In contrast, at steady-state [3H]BK represented 30-40% of the released activity. While chloroquine (100 microM) did not alter the rate of [3H]BK internalization or release or the intracellular distribution of [3H]BK, this agent significantly decreased the rate of [3H]BK degradation in both pathways. In all, these results show that B2 kinin receptor-mediated internalization of BK is a process integral to the interaction of BK with DDT1 MF-2 smooth muscle cells and may be a mechanism for terminating BK actions by rapidly removing extracellular free and receptor-bound BK and accessing various intracellular BK degradative pathways."
https://openalex.org/W1560724868,"The effects of topoisomerases I and II on the replication of SV40 DNA were examined using an in vitro replication system of purified proteins that constitutes the monopolymerase system. In the presence of the two topoisomerases, two distinct nascent DNAs were formed. One product arising from the replication of the leading template strand was approximately half the size of the template DNA, whereas the other product derived from the lagging template strand consisted of short DNAs. These products were synthesized from both SV40 naked DNA and SV40 chromosomes. For the replication of SV40 naked DNA, either topoisomerase I or II maintained replication fork movement and supported complete leading strand synthesis. When SV40 chromosomes were replicated with the same proteins, reactions containing only topoisomerase I produced shorter leading strands. However, mature size DNA products accumulated in reactions supplemented with topoisomerase II, as well as in reactions containing only topoisomerase II. In the presence of crude extracts of HeLa cells, VP-16, a specific inhibitor of topoisomerase II, blocked elongation of the nascent DNA during the replication of SV40 chromosomes. These results indicate that topoisomerase II plays a crucial role as a swivelase in the late stage of SV40 chromosome replication in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W1481883899,"Preparations enriched in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii thylakoids have proven useful in the study of photosynthesis. Many of their polypeptides however remain unidentified. We report here on three of those, h1 (34 kDa), h2 (11 kDa), and P3 (63 kDa). h1, h2, and P3 are present in all tested mutants of C. reinhardtii lacking either one or several of the photosynthetic chain complexes or depleted in thylakoid membranes. h2 is an ascorbate-reducible, soluble c550-type cytochrome encoded in the nucleus. It cross-reacts immunologically with mitochondrial cytochromes c from various sources and contains a hexapeptide encoded in C. reinhardtii cytochrome c cDNA. P3, a nuclear-encoded peripheral protein, cross-reacts with various ATP synthase beta subunits. Its N-terminal sequence is encoded in C. reinhardtii mitochondrial beta subunit cDNA. h1 behaves as an integral hemoprotein; it is absent in a mitochondrial mutant that carries a deletion in apocytochrome b gene. We conclude that C. reinhardtii mitochondrial membranes copurify with thylakoid membranes. h1 is part of the cytochrome bc1 complex, h2 is cytochrome c, and P3 is the beta subunit of mitochondrial ATP synthase."
https://openalex.org/W1556250291,"Electron nuclear double resonance (ENDOR) spectroscopy is used to probe the coordination of the mixed valence (Fe(II).Fe(III)) diiron cluster of the methane monooxygenase hydroxylase component (MMOH-) isolated from Methylosinus trichosporium OB3b. ENDOR resonances are observed along the principal axis directions g1 = 1.94 and g3 = 1.76 from at least nine different protons and two different nitrogens. The nitrogens are strongly coupled and appear to be directly coordinated to the cluster irons. The ratio of their superhyperfine coupling constants is roughly 4:7, which equals the ratio of the spin expectation values of the Fe(II) and Fe(III) in the ground state and suggests that at least one nitrogen is coordinated to each iron of the mixed valence cluster. Moreover, the superhyperfine and quadrupole coupling constants assigned to the Fe(III) site (AN = 13.6 MHz, PN = 0.7 MHz) are comparable with those observed for semimethemerythrin sulfide (AN = 12.1 MHz, PN = 0.7 MHz), for which the nitrogen ligands are histidines. At least three of the coupled protons exchange slowly when MMOH- is incubated in D2O, and 2H ENDOR resonances are subsequently observed. These observations are also consistent with histidine ligation of the iron cluster. On addition of the inhibitor dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) to MMOH- the EPR spectrum sharpens and shifts dramatically. Only one set of 14N ENDOR resonances is observed with frequencies equal to those assigned to the Fe(III)-histidine resonances of uncomplexed MMOH- suggesting that the nitrogen coordination to the Fe(II) site is altered or possibly lost in the presence of Me2SO. 2H ENDOR resonances are observed in the presence of d6-Me2SO indicating that the inhibitor Me2SO binds near or possibly to the diiron cluster. In contrast, no 2H ENDOR resonances are observed from d4-methanol upon addition to MMOH-. Thus, the changes observed in the EPR spectrum of MMOH- upon addition of methanol may result from binding to a site away from the diiron cluster or from bulk solvent effects on the protein structure."
https://openalex.org/W1602115143,"We previously have shown that insulin treatment of cells greatly increases the activity of phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase in immunoprecipitates made with an antibody to phosphotyrosine. However, the association of PI 3-kinase activity with the activated insulin receptor is not significant under these conditions. In the present study, we have attempted to reconstitute the association of PI 3-kinase activity with the activated insulin receptor in vitro. PI 3-kinase activity does indeed associate with the autophosphorylated insulin receptor in our in vitro system. The autophosphorylation of the insulin receptor and/or its associated conformational change appear to be necessary for the association of PI 3-kinase activity with the receptor, since kinase negative receptor failed to bind PI 3-kinase activity. After binding, PI 3-kinase or its associated protein seems to be released from the activated receptor after the completion of its tyrosine phosphorylation by the receptor. Tyr960 in the juxtamembrane region of the insulin receptor beta-subunit seems to be involved in the association of PI 3-kinase activity with the receptor, but not C terminus region of the beta-subunit including two tyrosine autophosphorylation sites (Tyr1316 and Tyr1322). The in vitro assay system for the association of PI 3-kinase activity with the insulin receptor can be utilized to study the mechanism of interaction of these molecules and will be an useful method to detect other associated molecules with the insulin receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1564860850,"Human monoamine oxidase A that had been synthesized in a reticulocyte lysate translation system was capable of binding to and inserting into either rat liver mitochondria or isolated mitochondrial outer membranes. The inserted form was as resistant to proteinase K as endogenous mitochondrial monoamine oxidase A. The insertion, but not the binding, of monoamine oxidase A was prevented by depleting the reaction mixture of either ATP (with apyrase) or ubiquitin (with purified antibodies against this polypeptide). Addition of ATP or ubiquitin, respectively, to these depleted mixtures restored the insertion of the enzyme. In the absence of mitochondria, in vitro synthesized monoamine oxidase A did not catalyze its own alkylation by the mechanism-based inhibitor, [3H]clorgyline. However, both monoamine oxidase A that had been membrane-inserted in vitro and monoamine oxidase A that had been bound to the mitochondria under conditions of ATP depletion catalyzed adduct formation. Furthermore, reaction of either clorgyline or another mechanism-based inhibitor, pargyline, with the membrane-bound enzyme during ATP depletion inhibited the insertion of monoamine oxidase A when ATP was restored. These observations indicate that monoamine oxidase A acquired a catalytically active conformation on interaction with the mitochondrial outer membranes prior to its ATP and ubiquitin-dependent insertion into the membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1610966535,"One of the functions of chromogranin A (CGA), the major soluble component of secretory granules in both adrenal medullary chromaffin cells and many other endocrine cell types appears to be that of a prohormone. CGA is the precursor of several peptides including pancreastatin, a 49-residue peptide, and a 20-residue peptide, chromostatin, which have been identified as biologically active peptides. Chromostatin produces a dose-dependent inhibition (ID50 of 5 nM) of the secretagogue-evoked catecholamine secretion from chromaffin cells. Here we report that chromostatin potently inhibits L-type calcium currents recorded with the nystatin-perforated patch technique in cultured chromaffin cells. This inhibitory effect of chromostatin on calcium currents was not observed in experiments using the classical patch-clamp whole-cell approach which induces the leakage of cytoplasmic components. Using 125I-chromostatin, we show that chromostatin exhibits a fully reversible and saturable binding to the plasma membrane of cultured chromaffin cells. Analysis of binding experiments at equilibrium indicates the existence of one class of binding sites with a Bmax of 2.7 pmol/mg of chromaffin cell proteins and an apparent Kd of 6.5 nM. This high affinity is in good correlation with the half-maximal concentration (ID50 5 nM) of chromostatin inhibiting catecholamine secretion from chromaffin cells. Specificity of the chromostatin binding was further assessed by displacement experiments with unlabeled CGA-related or -unrelated peptides. We found an excellent quantitative correlation between the affinities of the various peptides determined by binding assays and their functional potency tested on catecholamine secretion: bovine chromostatin greater than human chromostatin greater than CGA much greater than rat chromostatin, pancreastatin, CAP-14, substance P, and Leu-enkephalin. Cross-linking experiments reveal that chromostatin associates specifically with an 80-kDa plasma membrane protein. These results together with the patch-clamp experiments support the idea that chromaffin cells possess specific chromostatin receptors and that activation of such receptors leads to the inhibition of L-type voltage-sensitive calcium channels through an intracellular second messenger pathway."

Iota toxin ADP-ribosylated actin in the G-A complex from human platelets as effectively as skeletal muscle actin. The Km for NAD (4 microM) was identical for both substrates. C2 toxin ADP-ribosylated actin in the G-A complex with lower efficacy than nonmuscle actin from platelet cytosol. In the G-A-A complex both actin molecules were ADP-ribosylated by iota toxin. The G-A complex bound ADP-ribosylated actin (Ar) to form the G-A-Ar complex in which the weakly bound actin is ADP-ribosylated. Vice versa, ADP-ribosylated 1:1 gelsolin-actin complex (G-Ar) was able to bind unmodified actin to yield the G-Ar-A complex. ADP-ribosylation did not change the nucleation activity of either the G-Ar complex or the G-Ar-A complex. When monomeric actin was added to the G-A-Ar complex, polymerization of actin was delayed by about 10 min. According to a quantitative kinetic analysis, the delay of polymerization corresponded to the rate of dissociation of ADP-ribosylated actin from the G-A-Ar complex. This suggests that the nucleation activity of the G-A-A complex is inhibited by ADP-ribosylation of the weakly bound actin and that the inhibition can be removed by dissociation of ADP-ribosylated actin from the G-A-Ar complex."
https://openalex.org/W1563846221,"Formyl peptides and leukotriene B4 (LTB4) stimulate disparate neutrophil functional responses and second messenger generation. The hypothesis that differences in receptor-guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G protein) interaction account for the disparate responses was examined using HL-60 granulocyte plasma membranes. The quantity of receptor-coupled G proteins was determined by guanosine 5'-(gamma-thio)triphosphate (GTP gamma S) equilibrium binding in the presence or absence of f-Met-Leu-Phe and/or LTB4. About one-third of the total GTP gamma S binding sites were coupled to f-Met-Leu-Phe receptors, to LTB4 receptors, and to receptors when both ligands were added simultaneously. The dissociation constant of GTP gamma S-binding sites in the presence of LTB4 was significantly greater than that in the presence of f-Met-Leu-Phe. f-Met-Leu-Phe shifted the GDP dose-inhibition curve for GTP gamma S binding further to the right than did LTB4. The apparent initial rate of GTP hydrolysis and GTP gamma S binding stimulated by f-Met-Leu-Phe was significantly greater than that stimulated by LTB4. There were significantly more formyl peptide receptors than LTB4 receptors, however, formyl peptide and LTB4 receptor density did not differ under GTP gamma S binding assay conditions. The rate of GTP hydrolysis stimulated by LTB4 was not increased in membranes containing twice the LTB4 receptor density. We conclude that formyl peptide receptors stimulate more rapid activation of a common pool of G proteins than LTB4 receptors because of a significantly reduced affinity of formyl peptide receptor-activated G proteins for GDP."
https://openalex.org/W1593648033,"When incubated with N6-2'-O-dibutyryladenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (dbcAMP), HL-60 cells expressed formyl peptide receptor (FPR) (as assessed by ligand binding) and FPR transcripts in a time- and concentration-dependent fashion. Experiments using dbcAMP analogs modified at either the C-6 or C-8 position indicated that the process was mediated by a protein kinase A type I, and protein kinase A type I activity was isolated from undifferentiated HL-60 cells by DEAE-Sephacel chromatography. Forskolin mimicked the effects of dbcAMP. Forskolin and dbcAMP-dependent expression of FPR and FPR transcript was inhibited by staurosporine. Retinoic acid (but not retinal or retinol) was capable of inhibiting dbcAMP-dependent expression of FPR mRNA half-life. Dexamethasone enhanced the effects of dbcAMP and blocked the inhibitory effect of retinoic acid on expression of FPR and FPR transcripts. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) alone (1.5-15 nM) failed to induce HL-60 to express FPR and FPR transcripts. Low concentrations (1.5 nM) of PMA enhanced the ability of dbcAMP to induce HL-60 cells to express FPR and FPR transcript, whereas high (15 nM) concentrations of PMA inhibited dbcAMP effects. These results indicate that expression of FPR and FPR transcripts by HL-60 cells can be up- and down-regulated by agents that induce HL-60 cells to differentiate and that a cross-talk effect exists between protein kinase A and protein kinase C that modulates FPR gene transcription (and receptor expression) by these cells."
https://openalex.org/W1587237124,"The oxidized binuclear heme a3/CuB center of slow forms of bovine cytochrome oxidase exhibits a characteristic EPR signal at g' = 12. Following the (rapid) dithionite reduction of heme a and CuA, an additional EPR signal becomes apparent at g' = 2.95. As electrons enter the binuclear center this signal decays at the same slow rate as the g' = 12 signal. In the fully oxidized slow enzyme the small g' = 2.95 signal is usually masked by the g = 3 heme a signal, but it is readily detectable at low temperatures and high microwave powers. It is present in both the intrinsic and formate-ligated slow enzymes, but not in any form of fast preparation. The g' = 2.95 signal has similar temperature dependence and microwave power saturation characteristics to the g' = 12 signal. We conclude that the signal arises from the same population of binuclear centers responsible for the g' = 12 signal. The appearance of a signal at g' = 2.95 in X-band EPR is consistent with, but does not prove, the model of Hagen where the g' = 12 signal arises from a ferryl heme a3, with CuB cuprous and EPR-silent (Hagen, W. R. (1982) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 708, 82-98)."
https://openalex.org/W2096376316,"The effect of charges existing on the mature domain of secretory proteins on the efficiency and protonmotive force dependence of translocation into everted membrane vesicles of Escherichia coli was studied. Model secretory proteins devoid of charges on the mature domain were constructed at the DNA level using proOmpF-Lpp as the starting protein. The chargeless presecretory proteins thus constructed were translocated and processed for the signal peptide much faster than proOmpF-Lpp and the rate of translocation was appreciably enhanced by imposition of the protonmotive force. Not only the membrane potential but also delta pH were effective in stimulating the rate of translocation of the chargeless proteins. The results indicate that the mature domain does not have to be charged for the secretory translocation and that the major requirement of the protonmotive force for the secretory translocation is not for the movement, including an electrophoretic one, of charged regions of the mature domain. All of the proOmpF-Lpp derivatives thus constructed were translocated efficiently into everted membrane vesicles in a SecA-dependent manner, irrespective of their size. The mature domain of the smallest one was 45 amino acid residues in length. Contrary to the views previously presented by other workers, these results suggest that there is no sharp boundary at the reported regions for the translocation of presecretory proteins across the cytoplasmic membrane or for the requirement of SecA."
https://openalex.org/W1507392712,The human asialoglycoprotein receptor expressed by the HepG2 cell line is composed of the two homologous polypeptides H1 and H2. Transblot analysis of HepG2 cell lysates indicated that the progressive loss in the steady-state level of asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGR) when cells were maintained in medium supplemented with dialyzed fetal bovine serum was reversed by the addition of cell-permeant 8-bromo-cGMP. Estimates of the steady-state levels of H1- and H2-related mRNA by Northern blot analysis indicated that the reduction of ASGR was not the result of a concomitant reduction in gene transcript number. No difference in the translatability of the mRNAs derived from cells grown in medium supplemented with fetal bovine serum or its dialyzed counterpart was detected. Resolution of the mRNAs by sucrose gradient centrifugation suggests that cGMP-mediated posttranscriptional regulation of ASGR expression was due to a shift of both H1 and H2 mRNAs from the ribonucleoprotein fraction into a translationally active membrane-associated polysomal pool.
https://openalex.org/W1505499143,"The NADPH oxidase is a multicomponent enzyme system that produces the reduced oxygen species essential for bacterial killing by polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN). Study of the oxidase has typically been carried out in cell-free systems in which Km values of 20-150 microM NADPH have been reported. However, when compared with affinities reported for other flavoprotein dehydrogenases and when considering the cellular concentration of NADPH/NADP+ of approximately 35 microM, the reported affinity of the oxidase for NADPH appears low. To investigate this apparent discrepancy we have studied the kinetics of NADPH oxidase activation in situ in human PMN permeabilized with Staphylococcus aureus alpha-toxin. alpha-Toxin permeabilization of human PMN did not initiate NADPH oxidase activation at physiologic concentrations of NADPH. If permeabilized cells were stimulated with 1 microM formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine, 10 microM guanosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate), 0.5 mM Ca2+, 5 micrograms/ml cytochalasin B in the presence of varying concentrations of NADPH, we were able to demonstrate activation of the oxidase complex as shown by superoxide dismutase-inhibitable reduction of cytochrome c. In this system we determined that the Km for oxidase activation was 4-7 microM NADPH, a 4-10-fold decrease from reported values. The oxidase was the enzyme being studied as shown by the absence of enzymatic activity in patients with chronic granulomatous disease. In addition, if the enzyme was initially activated in permeabilized cells, the cells homogenized, and the Km for the oxidase determined in a cell-free system, the observed Km reverted to previously reported values (36 microM). These results indicate that NADPH oxidase, studied in situ, has a significantly higher substrate affinity than that observed in isolated membranes and, moreover, indicate that substrate affinity is optimal for catalysis at reported concentrations of cytosolic NADPH."
https://openalex.org/W1622917298,"The trpB8 mutation of Escherichia coli tryptophan synthase is unique in that the cells bearing this lesion are not only capable of utilizing indole for growth, but they also accumulate indole, under conditions of tryptophan limitation. The lesion was shown by DNA sequencing to be a G to C transversion at nucleotide 5528 of the trp operon, resulting in a Gly to Arg switch at codon 281. Gly-281, within the trypsin-sensitive region, is invariant among all known beta polypeptides. The catalytic activity of the mutant beta 2(B8) protein is dramatically stimulated by alpha subunit, both in vivo and in vitro. In the absence of alpha subunit, ammonium ion effectively stimulated the activity in an apparently cooperative manner. The pH optimum for the mutant subunit was 9.8, which is 2 units higher than that of wild type. In contrast to the wild-type subunit, beta(B8) partially aggregated within cells upon overexpression. At the optimal concentration of ammonium ions (2.25 M), the beta 2(B8) mutant enzyme displayed lower affinity than wild-type enzyme toward indole and L-serine, but the Vmax was almost unchanged. The physicochemical behavior of beta 2(B8) is supported by computer graphic modeling studies. An open versus closed model of conformational change within the beta 2 protein is proposed. A plausible role for the hinge region is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1563304706,"Second derivative absorption spectroscopy has been used to assess the effects of complex formation between cytochrome c and cytochrome c oxidase on the conformation of the cytochrome a cofactor. When ferrocytochrome c is complexed to the cyanide-inhibited reduced or mixed valence enzyme, the conformation of ferrocytochrome a is affected. The second derivative spectrum of these enzyme forms displays two electronic transitions at 443 and 451 nm before complex formation, but only the 443-nm transition after cytochrome c is bound. This effect is not induced by poly-L-lysine, a homopolypeptide which is known to bind to the cytochrome c binding domain of cytochrome c oxidase. The effect is limited to cyanide-inhibited forms of the enzyme; no effect was observed for the fully reduced unliganded or fully reduced carbon monoxide-inhibited enzyme. The spectral signatures of these changes and the fact that they are exclusively associated with the cyanide-inhibited enzyme are both reminiscent of the effects of low pH on the conformation of cytochrome a (Ishibe, N., Lynch, S., and Copeland, R. A. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 23916-23920). These results are discussed in terms of possible mechanisms of communication between the cytochrome c binding site, cytochrome a, and the oxygen binding site within the cytochrome c oxidase molecule."
https://openalex.org/W1546939475,"Solvent perturbation studies in 100% dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) have been carried out on rabbit liver metallothionein (MT) in an effort to learn more about the factors stabilizing the three-dimensional structure and the mechanism of cluster formation. As indicated by the electronic absorption spectra of Co7-metallothionein, the reconstituted protein preserves its structural integrity in this solvent. Minor spectral differences between water and Me2SO were fully reversible. The titration of apoMT with cobalt(II) in Me2SO, followed by UV-visible-near-infrared electronic absorption, circular dichroism, magnetic circular dichroism, and EPR spectroscopy, indicate that the protein can refold in this solvent. A comparison with the previous titration data in water reveals that the first four titration steps in both solvents are identical, indicating a thermodynamically controlled folding process. However, the reversed order of the cluster completion between Me2SO and water may suggest the involvement of a kinetically controlled folding process in the last three titration steps. A new cluster form developed with approximately nine Co(II) equivalents."
