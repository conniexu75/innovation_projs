https://openalex.org/W2064526034,"Treatment options for hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection have limited efficacy and high toxicity, resulting in poor adherence and, thus, viral resistance. Identifying previously unrecognized pathways involved in HCV infection may aid the development of new therapeutics. Using an RNAi screen, Lupberger et al. have identified cellular kinases involved in HCV infection of liver cells and have tested the ability of approved inhibitors to block viral entry both in vitro and in vivo. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a major cause of liver disease, but therapeutic options are limited and there are no prevention strategies. Viral entry is the first step of infection and requires the cooperative interaction of several host cell factors. Using a functional RNAi kinase screen, we identified epidermal growth factor receptor and ephrin receptor A2 as host cofactors for HCV entry. Blocking receptor kinase activity by approved inhibitors broadly impaired infection by all major HCV genotypes and viral escape variants in cell culture and in a human liver chimeric mouse model in vivo. The identified receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) mediate HCV entry by regulating CD81–claudin-1 co-receptor associations and viral glycoprotein–dependent membrane fusion. These results identify RTKs as previously unknown HCV entry cofactors and show that tyrosine kinase inhibitors have substantial antiviral activity. Inhibition of RTK function may constitute a new approach for prevention and treatment of HCV infection."
https://openalex.org/W2105598902,"Cellular RNA levels are determined by the interplay of RNA production, processing and degradation. However, because most studies of RNA regulation do not distinguish the separate contributions of these processes, little is known about how they are temporally integrated. Here we combine metabolic labeling of RNA at high temporal resolution with advanced RNA quantification and computational modeling to estimate RNA transcription and degradation rates during the response of mouse dendritic cells to lipopolysaccharide. We find that changes in transcription rates determine the majority of temporal changes in RNA levels, but that changes in degradation rates are important for shaping sharp 'peaked' responses. We used sequencing of the newly transcribed RNA population to estimate temporally constant RNA processing and degradation rates genome wide. Degradation rates vary significantly between genes and contribute to the observed differences in the dynamic response. Certain transcripts, including those encoding cytokines and transcription factors, mature faster. Our study provides a quantitative approach to study the integrative process of RNA regulation."
https://openalex.org/W2080351920,"The honeybee (Apis mellifera) forms two female castes: the queen and the worker. This dimorphism depends not on genetic differences, but on ingestion of royal jelly, although the mechanism through which royal jelly regulates caste differentiation has long remained unknown. Here I show that a 57-kDa protein in royal jelly, previously designated as royalactin, induces the differentiation of honeybee larvae into queens. Royalactin increased body size and ovary development and shortened developmental time in honeybees. Surprisingly, it also showed similar effects in the fruitfly (Drosophila melanogaster). Mechanistic studies revealed that royalactin activated p70 S6 kinase, which was responsible for the increase of body size, increased the activity of mitogen-activated protein kinase, which was involved in the decreased developmental time, and increased the titre of juvenile hormone, an essential hormone for ovary development. Knockdown of epidermal growth factor receptor (Egfr) expression in the fat body of honeybees and fruitflies resulted in a defect of all phenotypes induced by royalactin, showing that Egfr mediates these actions. These findings indicate that a specific factor in royal jelly, royalactin, drives queen development through an Egfr-mediated signalling pathway. The difference between the queen in a honeybee colony and the workers is not a matter of genetics but of nutrition: larvae that consume royal jelly become queens. The active royal-jelly ingredient has long remained elusive, but is now identified as royalactin, a previously known protein that exhibits epidermal growth factor (EGFR)-like effects on rat hepatocytes. Surprisingly, royalactin also induces queen-like phenotypes in the fruitfly Drosophila melanogaster, increasing body size and ovary development through an EGFR-mediated signalling pathway."

https://openalex.org/W2043532115,"Sarah Fortune and colleagues report the whole-genome sequencing of Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains isolated from cynomolgus macaques with either active, latent or early reactivation disease. They estimate a similar mutation rate for these disease states in vivo, as well as for the bacterium in vitro. This suggests that M. tuberculosis has a greater mutational rate during latent and early reactivation disease than previously predicted and may be able to acquire drug resistance during these states. Tuberculosis poses a global health emergency, which has been compounded by the emergence of drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) strains. We used whole-genome sequencing to compare the accumulation of mutations in Mtb isolated from cynomolgus macaques with active, latent or reactivated disease. We sequenced 33 Mtb isolates from nine macaques with an average genome coverage of 93% and an average read depth of 117×. Based on the distribution of SNPs observed, we calculated the mutation rates for these disease states. We found a similar mutation rate during latency as during active disease or in a logarithmically growing culture over the same period of time. The pattern of polymorphisms suggests that the mutational burden in vivo is because of oxidative DNA damage. We show that Mtb continues to acquire mutations during disease latency, which may explain why isoniazid monotherapy for latent tuberculosis is a risk factor for the emergence of isoniazid resistance1,2."
https://openalex.org/W1995709551,"We recently reported that shikonin and its analogs were a class of necroptotic inducers that could bypass cancer drug resistance. However, the molecular targets of shikonin are not known. Here, we showed that shikonin and its analogs are inhibitors of tumor-specific pyruvate kinase-M2 (PKM2), among which shikonin and its enantiomeric isomer alkannin were the most potent and showed promising selectivity, that is, shikonin and alkannin at concentrations that resulted in over 50% inhibition of PKM2 activity did not inhibit PKM1 and pyruvate kinase-L (PKL). Shikonin and alkannin significantly inhibited the glycolytic rate, as manifested by cellular lactate production and glucose consumption in drug-sensitive and resistant cancer cell lines (MCF-7, MCF-7/Adr, MCF-7/Bcl-2, MCF-7/Bcl-xL and A549) that primarily express PKM2. HeLa cells transfected with PKM1 showed reduced sensitivity to shikonin- or alkannin-induced cell death. To the best of our knowledge, shikonin and alkannin are the most potent and specific inhibitors to PKM2 reported so far. As PKM2 universally expresses in cancer cells and dictates the last rate-limiting step of glycolysis vital for cancer cell proliferation and survival, enantiomeric shikonin and alkannin may have potential in future clinical application."
https://openalex.org/W2163560143,"The experiences of patients who try drugs that aren't approved for their disease have the potential to be mined for insights into drug efficacy. Wicks et al. rapidly monitored the efficacy of lithium treatment for 149 patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis using an online data collection tool and a patient-matching algorithm. Patients with serious diseases may experiment with drugs that have not received regulatory approval. Online patient communities structured around quantitative outcome data have the potential to provide an observational environment to monitor such drug usage and its consequences. Here we describe an analysis of data reported on the website PatientsLikeMe by patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) who experimented with lithium carbonate treatment. To reduce potential bias owing to lack of randomization, we developed an algorithm to match 149 treated patients to multiple controls (447 total) based on the progression of their disease course. At 12 months after treatment, we found no effect of lithium on disease progression. Although observational studies using unblinded data are not a substitute for double-blind randomized control trials, this study reached the same conclusion as subsequent randomized trials, suggesting that data reported by patients over the internet may be useful for accelerating clinical discovery and evaluating the effectiveness of drugs already in use."
https://openalex.org/W2118947728,"Projection neurons migrate from the ventricular zone to the neocortical plate during the development of the mouse brain. Their overall movement is radial, but they become multipolar and move nonradially in the intermediate zone. Here we show that Reelin, the Rap1 GTPase and N-cadherin (NCad) are important for multipolar neurons to polarize their migration toward the cortical plate. Inhibition and rescue experiments indicated that Reelin regulates migration through Rap1 and Akt, and that the Rap1-regulated GTPases RalA, RalB, Rac1 and Cdc42 are also involved. We found that Rap1 regulated the plasma membrane localization of NCad and NCad rescued radial polarization when Rap1 was inhibited. However, inhibition of Rap1 or NCad had little effect on glia-dependent locomotion. We propose a multistep mechanism in which Reelin activates Rap1, Rap1 upregulates NCad, and NCad is needed to orient cell migration."

https://openalex.org/W1982240205,"Neurotransmitters are removed from the synapse by neurotransmitter/Na+ symporters (NSSs) in a reuptake process driven by the Na+ gradient. Zhao et al. examined the coupling of substrate binding to structural transitions in the prokaryotic NSS homologue LeuT. Using single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer, functional experiments and computational studies, they find that LeuT facilitates intracellular gate opening and substrate release at the intracellular face of the protein. Neurotransmitter/Na+ symporters (NSSs) terminate neuronal signalling by recapturing neurotransmitter released into the synapse in a co-transport (symport) mechanism driven by the Na+ electrochemical gradient1,2,3,4,5,6. NSSs for dopamine, noradrenaline and serotonin are targeted by the psychostimulants cocaine and amphetamine1, as well as by antidepressants7. The crystal structure of LeuT, a prokaryotic NSS homologue, revealed an occluded conformation in which a leucine (Leu) and two Na+ are bound deep within the protein8. This structure has been the basis for extensive structural and computational exploration of the functional mechanisms of proteins with a LeuT-like fold9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22. Subsequently, an ‘outward-open’ conformation was determined in the presence of the inhibitor tryptophan23, and the Na+-dependent formation of a dynamic outward-facing intermediate was identified using electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy24. In addition, single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer imaging has been used to reveal reversible transitions to an inward-open LeuT conformation, which involve the movement of transmembrane helix TM1a away from the transmembrane helical bundle22. We investigated how substrate binding is coupled to structural transitions in LeuT during Na+-coupled transport. Here we report a process whereby substrate binding from the extracellular side of LeuT facilitates intracellular gate opening and substrate release at the intracellular face of the protein. In the presence of alanine, a substrate that is transported ∼10-fold faster than leucine15,25, we observed alanine-induced dynamics in the intracellular gate region of LeuT that directly correlate with transport efficiency. Collectively, our data reveal functionally relevant and previously hidden aspects of the NSS transport mechanism that emphasize the functional importance of a second substrate (S2) binding site within the extracellular vestibule15,20. Substrate binding in this S2 site appears to act cooperatively with the primary substrate (S1) binding site to control intracellular gating more than 30 Å away, in a manner that allows the Na+ gradient to power the transport mechanism."

https://openalex.org/W2045780885,"The function, trafficking and synaptic signaling of AMPA receptors are tightly regulated by phosphorylation. Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII) phosphorylates the GluA1 AMPA receptor subunit at Ser831 to increase single-channel conductance. We show that CaMKII increases the conductance of native heteromeric AMPA receptors in mouse hippocampal neurons through phosphorylation of Ser831. In addition, co-expression of transmembrane AMPA receptor regulatory proteins (TARPs) with recombinant receptors is required for phospho-Ser831 to increase conductance of heteromeric GluA1-GluA2 receptors. Finally, phosphorylation of Ser831 increases the efficiency with which each subunit can activate, independent of agonist efficacy, thereby increasing the likelihood that more receptor subunits will be simultaneously activated during gating. This underlies the observation that phospho-Ser831 increases the frequency of openings to larger conductances rather than altering unitary conductance. Together, these findings suggest that CaMKII phosphorylation of GluA1-Ser831 decreases the activation energy for an intrasubunit conformational change that regulates the conductance of the receptor when the channel pore opens."
https://openalex.org/W2120836514,"Deficiency in fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) results in fragile X syndrome (FXS), an inherited form of intellectual disability. Despite extensive research, it is unclear how FMRP deficiency contributes to the cognitive deficits in FXS. Fmrp-null mice show reduced adult hippocampal neurogenesis. As Fmrp is also enriched in mature neurons, we investigated the function of Fmrp expression in neural stem and progenitor cells (aNSCs) and its role in adult neurogenesis. Here we show that ablation of Fmrp in aNSCs by inducible gene recombination leads to reduced hippocampal neurogenesis in vitro and in vivo, as well as markedly impairing hippocampus-dependent learning in mice. Conversely, restoration of Fmrp expression specifically in aNSCs rescues these learning deficits in Fmrp-deficient mice. These data suggest that defective adult neurogenesis may contribute to the learning impairment seen in FXS, and these learning deficits can be rectified by delayed restoration of Fmrp specifically in aNSCs."

https://openalex.org/W2066845647,"Although it is well recognized that bacteria respond to environmental stress through global networks, the mechanism by which stress is relayed to the interior of the cell is poorly understood. Here we show that enigmatic toxin-antitoxin systems are vital in mediating the environmental stress response. Specifically, the antitoxin MqsA represses rpoS, which encodes the master regulator of stress. Repression of rpoS by MqsA reduces the concentration of the internal messenger 3,5-cyclic diguanylic acid, leading to increased motility and decreased biofilm formation. Furthermore, the repression of rpoS by MqsA decreases oxidative stress resistance via catalase activity. Upon oxidative stress, MqsA is rapidly degraded by Lon protease, resulting in induction of rpoS. Hence, we show that external stress alters gene regulation controlled by toxin-antitoxin systems, such that the degradation of antitoxins during stress leads to a switch from the planktonic state (high motility) to the biofilm state (low motility)."

https://openalex.org/W2069808171,"Pheromones regulate male social behaviors in Drosophila, but the identities and behavioral role(s) of these chemosensory signals, and how they interact, are incompletely understood. We found that (z)-7-tricosene, a male-enriched cuticular hydrocarbon that was previously shown to inhibit male-male courtship, was essential for normal levels of aggression. The mechanisms by which (z)-7-tricosene induced aggression and suppressed courtship were independent, but both required the gustatory receptor Gr32a. Sensitivity to (z)-7-tricosene was required for the aggression-promoting effect of 11-cis-vaccenyl acetate (cVA), an olfactory pheromone, but (z)-7-tricosene sensitivity was independent of cVA. (z)-7-tricosene and cVA therefore regulate aggression in a hierarchical manner. Furthermore, the increased courtship caused by depletion of male cuticular hydrocarbons was suppressed by a mutation in the olfactory receptor Or47b. Thus, male social behaviors are controlled by gustatory pheromones that promote aggression and suppress courtship, and whose influences are dominant to olfactory pheromones that enhance these behaviors."
https://openalex.org/W1999832198,"Calcium-activated chloride currents are thought to amplify the olfactory signal during the transduction process. Here the authors identify Ano2 as the critical channel in both main olfactory epithelium and in the vomeronasal organ. Surprisingly, disruption of Ano2 did not reduce performance in an olfactory behavioral task, suggesting that olfaction does not actually depend on these channels. Canonical olfactory signal transduction involves the activation of cyclic AMP–activated cation channels that depolarize the cilia of receptor neurons and raise intracellular calcium. Calcium then activates Cl− currents that may be up to tenfold larger than cation currents and are believed to powerfully amplify the response. We identified Anoctamin2 (Ano2, also known as TMEM16B) as the ciliary Ca2+-activated Cl− channel of olfactory receptor neurons. Ano2 is expressed in the main olfactory epithelium (MOE) and in the vomeronasal organ (VNO), which also expresses the related Ano1 channel. Disruption of Ano2 in mice virtually abolished Ca2+-activated Cl− currents in the MOE and VNO. Ano2 disruption reduced fluid-phase electro-olfactogram responses by only ∼40%, did not change air-phase electro-olfactograms and did not reduce performance in olfactory behavioral tasks. In contrast with the current view, cyclic nucleotide–gated cation channels do not need a boost by Cl− channels to achieve near-physiological levels of olfaction."

Remarkably, although they have been linked to a plethora of cellular processes, the molecular control of UCP2 and UCP3 has remained elusive. Reactive cysteine residues of cellular proteins are known sites of regulation by conjugation to GSH, a process referred to as glutathionylation. This is especially relevant for mitochondria because a large fraction of the mitochondrial proteome contains exposed thiols that can be covalently modified by GSH. We were intrigued by the fact that UCP2 and UCP3 proteins contain several cysteine residues located in predicted membrane-spanning domains and in a loop region in the mitochondrial matrix (22Boss O.

Here, we provide the first evidence that implicates reversible glutathionylation in the regulation of UCP2 and UCP3 function. We also show that glutathionylation and ROS-induced deglutathionylation work in tandem to turn UCP2 and UCP3 off and on, respectively. This novel mechanism for UCP2 and UCP3 control provides new insight into the putative role of these proteins for cellular ROS buffering. These results also improved our understanding of the function of these proteins in various physiological processes. Thymocytes were isolated from UCP2 null (knock-out (KO)) and wild-type (WT) mice as described previously (23Krauss S. Buttgereit F. Brand M.D. Biochim. Biophys.

Interscapular BAT was dissected from 2–3 mice/genotype, cleaned, and pooled in a 250 mm sucrose solution. The tissue was minced and then homogenized by hand using a glass/Teflon Potter-Elvehjem tissue grinder in a 250 mm sucrose solution containing 0.2% BSA. Mitochondria were isolated as described (26Shabalina I.G. Jacobsson A. Cannon B. Nedergaard J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 38236-38248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined by Bradford assay using BSA as the standard. Mitochondrial preparations were kept on ice, and all experiments were conducted within 4 h following completion of the isolation procedure. Experiments in skeletal muscle mitochondria were conducted in incubation medium containing 120 mm KCl, 1 mm EGTA, 5 mm KH2PO4, 5 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, supplemented with 0.3% defatted BSA. Experiments in BAT mitochondria were conducted in incubation medium containing 125 mm sucrose, 20 mm Tris-HCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 4 mm KH2PO4, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.2. An aliquot of mitochondria from BAT and skeletal muscle was frozen at −20 °C for immunoblot analysis. Oxygen consumption was measured in isolated mitochondria (0.5 mg/ml) or thymocytes at 37 °C using a Clark-type oxygen electrode (Hansatech, Norfolk, UK) and incubated in the appropriate incubation medium assumed to contain 406 nmol of oxygen/ml at 37 °C. Mitochondria were preincubated in the absence or presence of 2 μm diamide for skeletal muscle mitochondria and 100 μm diamide for BAT mitochondria with 1 μg/ml of oligomycin for 10 min at 37 °C before oxygen consumption measurements. 10 mm pyruvate and 5 mm malate were the substrates. For determinations in thymocytes, 20 × 106 cells were incubated in DMEM containing 5 mm glucose, 4 mm glutamine, and 1 mm pyruvate for 15 min at 37 °C containing oligomycin (1 μg/ml) and in the presence or absence of diamide (100 μm). Following incubations, cells were then placed in the Clark-type electrode chamber for oxygen consumption measurements. An aliquot of thymocytes was kept for immunoblot analysis of UCP2 levels. Membrane potential (Δψm) was determined fluorimetrically, using safranin O dye (5 μm; excitation 485 nm, emission 580 nm) in isolated mouse mitochondria (0.5 mg/ml) incubated in the requisite incubation medium at 37 °C (27Silva J.P. Shabalina I.G. Dufour E. Petrovic N. Backlund E.C. Hultenby K. Wibom R. Nedergaard J. Cannon B. Larsson N.G. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 4061-4070Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Prior to assessments, mitochondria were preincubated for 10 min in diamide (0–200 μm) and then treated with 1 μg/ml oligomycin to induce state 4 respiration conditions. The substrates used were 5 mm pyruvate and 3 mm malate for BAT and 5 mm succinate for skeletal muscle. The XF24 extracellular flux analyzer (Seahorse Bioscience, North Billerica, MA) was employed to determine the mitochondrial bioenergetic characteristics of primary myotubes exposed to menadione, diamide, and/or BSO. Primary myoblasts were seeded at 50,000 cells/ml in Matrigel-coated 24-well Seahorse XF24 culture plates. Upon differentiation and reaching confluence, the cells were exposed to menadione (0–20 μm) or BSO (0–100 μm) for 24 h and then incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in HCO3-free DMEM containing 5–10 mm glucose, 4 mm l-glutamine, and 1 mm pyruvate. Measurement of oxygen consumption rates (OCRs) was performed for three measurement intervals to assess basal metabolic rate (one measurement interval consists of a 2-min mixing, 2-min incubation, and 2-min measurement step). State 4 respiration, maximal metabolic rate, and extramitochondrial O2 consumption were ascertained by injecting oligomycin (1 μg/ml), carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (1 μm), and antimycin A (1 μm). The impact of glutathionylation on state 4 respiration was determined by exposing cells to 100 μm diamide for 15 min prior to the injection of oligomcycin. OCR was normalized to total cellular protein/well using the Bradford assay. Reactive cysteines and glutathionylation sites were tested by BIAM (Invitrogen) and BioGEE (Invitrogen) labeling (28Reynaert N.L. van der Vliet A. Guala A.S. McGovern T. Hristova M. Pantano C. Heintz N.H. Heim J. Ho Y.S. Matthews D.E. Wouters E.F. Janssen-Heininger Y.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 13086-13091Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar, 29Marino S.M. Li Y.

Briefly, partially purified UCP3 was diluted to 4 mg/ml in sucrose buffer (250 mm sucrose, Tris-HCl, pH 7) containing 100 μm BIAM or BioGEE and incubated for 30 min at room temperature in the dark under constant agitation. For control experiments, the samples were preincubated for 30 min at room temperature in 10 mm dithiothreitol (DTT) or 5 mm N-ethylmaleimide (NEM). Samples were then passed through a PD-10 Sephadex G25 desalting column (GE Healthcare) and eluted by centrifugation at 1000 rpm for 1 min (30Clavreul N. Adachi T. Pimental D.R. Ido Y. Schöneich C. Cohen R.A. FASEB J. 2006; 20: 518-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). BIAM and BioGEE-labeled proteins were then pulled out of solution with streptavidin-coated beads overnight at 4 °C. Beads were then collected, and the supernatant fraction was placed in an ice-cold minitube containing Laemmli buffer. Beads were separated from the BIAM and BioGEE-labeled proteins using sucrose media containing 5 m urea. Upon removal of the deproteinated beads, the sample was placed in an ice-cold minitube containing Laemmli buffer constituting the pull-down fraction. Samples were electrophoresed under non-reducing conditions, and then UCP3 was detected by immunoblot using anti-UCP3 antibody (Abcam). The glutathionylation of UCP3 was tested with glutaredoxin 1 (GRx1; Sigma). For GRx1, experiments were performed as described previously (31Applegate M.A. Humphries K.M. Szweda L.I. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 473-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Purified UCP3 was incubated in sucrose buffer for 15 min at 37 °C under constant agitation and in the dark with 0.5 mm GSH in the absence or presence of 10 units of GRx1. The samples were then incubated in 200 μm BioGEE for 30 min at room temperature under constant agitation and in the dark. The reaction was quenched with 5 mm NEM and passed through a PD-10 Sephadex G25 desalting column. The amount of UCP3 was accessed by immunoblot using anti-UCP3 antibody (Abcam). Kidneys from WT and UCP2 null (KO) mice were excised, flash-frozen, and stored at −80 °C. On the day of experiments, kidneys were placed in 10 ml of Trizma (Tris base)-buffered sucrose solution (125 mm sucrose, 25 mm Trizma, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, pH 7.2) and homogenized on ice using a glass/Teflon Potter-Elvehjem tissue grinder. The homogenate was then centrifuged at 150 × g for 5 min at 4 °C to remove any particulates and whole cells, and the supernatant was then tested for protein content. Protein was diluted to 4 mg/ml in sucrose buffer and incubated for 30 min in the dark at room temperature under constant agitation with 100 μm BioGEE. Reactions were quenched by the addition of NEM. 15 μg of total protein was then loaded in a 6–15% linear gradient SDS-gel and then electrophoresed under standard conditions. UCP2 biotinylated with BioGEE was detected by probing blots for 1 h at room temperature in the dark using an anti-biotin HRP-conjugated antibody (1:4000 dilution in 5% nonfat skim milk; Abcam). The electrophoretic mobility of UCP2 in the biotin blots was confirmed by probing for UCP2 on the same gel with anti-UCP2 antibody. The assay was optimized by loading various amounts of protein (5–60 μg) and by varying antibody dilution (1:500 to 1:4000) and incubation time (30 min to 24 h). To test whether UCP3 was glutathionylated, we employed mitochondria isolated from the skeletal muscle of WT and UCP3 null (KO) mice. Mitochondria were diluted to 4 mg/ml in sucrose buffer and incubated in BioGEE. Reactions were stopped by the addition of NEM. Protein was then loaded in a 6–15% linear gradient SDS-gel and then electrophoresed under standard conditions. Detection of biotinylation was performed using anti-biotin HRP-conjugated antibody (1:4000 dilution in 5% nonfat skim milk; Abcam). The electrophoretic mobility of UCP3 in the biotin blots was confirmed by probing for these proteins on the same gel with anti-UCP3 (1:1000 dilution, 24-h incubation at 4 °C; Abcam) antibody. CMV plasmid constructs containing the full-length human UCP3 were purchased from Origene Technologies (Rockville, MD). For the site-directed mutagenesis, suitable primers (from Sigma; 5′-gcaggcacagcagccgcttttgctgacctcgt-3′ and 3′-cgtccgtgtcgtcggcgaaaacgactggagca-5′ for UCP3C25A, 5′-ttggagccggcttcgctgccacagtggtgg-3′ and 3′-aacctcggccgaagcgacggtgtcaccacc-5′ for UCP3C230A, and 5′-tacttcagccccctcgacgctatgataaagatggtggc-3′ and 3′-atgaagtcgggggagctgcgatactatttctaccaccg-5′ for UCP3C259A, respectively) were used to change codons from cysteine to alanine. Primers were designed using the QuikChange II mutagenesis primer design application (Agilent Technologies). Mutants were generated using the QuikChange II site-directed mutagenesis kit (Agilent Technologies). Plasmids carrying the appropriate point mutation were confirmed using BLAST and Expasy. Transient transfections were carried out with Lipofectamine 2000 according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, HEK293 cells were seeded at 90% confluence in Matrigel-coated 60-mm dishes in antibiotic/antimycotic-free low glucose DMEM containing 10% FBS. Cells were treated with plasmid-Lipofectamine complex in antibiotic/antimycotic-free DMEM containing 10% FBS and incubated for ∼36 h in the cell incubator. The cell monolayer was washed once with PBS and then incubated for 1 h at 37 °C in serum and antimycotic/antibiotic-free DMEM containing 1 mm BioGEE. The cell monolayer was then quickly washed twice, and the cells were lysed on ice with precipitation buffer containing 25 mm NEM. BioGEE-labeled proteins were isolated as described above. UCP3 was detected by immunoblot as described above. Primary WT myotubes were treated for 1 h with serum-free LG DMEM containing 1 mm BioGEE. Monolayers were then washed once with serum-free DMEM and then treated with serum-free DMEM containing 0–100 μm H2O2 for 15 min. Cells were then immediately washed with PBS and lysed with precipitation buffer containing 25 mm NEM. BioGEE-labeled proteins were extracted as described above, and the presence of UCP3 was tested by immunoblot. Protein content was tested by a BCA assay. Cells exposed to BioGEE and H2O2 as described above were also tested for ROS levels. Immediately following H2O2 exposure, WT cells were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in differentiating media containing 20 μm dichlorofluorescein diacetate. Fluorescence was determined as described (17Mailloux R.J. Adjeitey C.N. Harper M.E. PLoS One. 2010; 5: e13289Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Primary WT and UCP3 null (KO) myotubes were treated with 100 μm diamide for 30 min and then isolated by trypsinization. Mitochondria were isolated by sonication and differential centrifugation as described (32Mailloux R.J. Harper M.E. FASEB J. 2010; 24: 2495-2506Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) with some modifications. 50 mm NEM was included in the mitochondrial isolation buffer. Mitochondria were permeabilized with 1% (w/v) digitonin on ice for 30 min, and the specific activity of complex I was then determined using 1.5 mm NADH and 0.5 mg/ml mitochondrial protein. NADH consumption was monitored as described (32Mailloux R.J. Harper M.E. FASEB J. 2010; 24: 2495-2506Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial protein concentration was determined using the Bradford assay. Primary myotubes from WT mice were treated with diamide (0–500 μm) for 1 h in serum-free media and then lysed in a radioimmune precipitation buffer containing 50 mm NEM (to quench diamide reaction). Protein-glutathione (PSSG) adducts were detected using anti-PSSG antibody (Virogen). PSSG adducts were detected as described (33Hill B.G. Higdon A.N. Dranka B.P. Darley-Usmar V.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2010; 1797: 285-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Primary myotubes were exposed to BSO (0–100 μm) for 24 h and then trypsinized and washed with PBS, and then total GSH levels were tested using a GSH detection kit provided by Sigma. WT and KO primary myotubes were seeded, grown, and differentiated in Matrigel-coated 96-well plates. Upon full differentiation, cells were treated for 24 h with differentiating medium containing 0–40 μm menadione or for 30 min with serum-free DMEM containing 0–500 μm diamide. Following the exposure, cell monolayers were washed, probed with propidium iodide, and then tested for amount of cell death as described (32Mailloux R.J. Harper M.E. FASEB J. 2010; 24: 2495-2506Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Immunoblots were carried out as described previously (32Mailloux R.J. Harper M.E. FASEB J. 2010; 24: 2495-2506Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The membranes were blocked and probed for 3–24 h at 4 °C with primary antibodies directed against UCP3 (1:1000 dilution for cell lysate, 1:500 dilution of detection following BioGEE pull-down from cell lysate, 1:2500 dilution for purified UCP3; Abcam), UCP2 (1:2000, N-19; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), UCP1 (1:10,000; Sigma), protein-glutathione adducts (1:500; Virogen), troponin T (1:1000; Abcam), and SDH (1:2000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). SDH and troponin T served as the loading standards. Membranes were then incubated for 1 h at room temperature with the requisite horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (anti-rabbit, anti-mouse, or anti-goat 1:2000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). Blots were incubated in enhanced chemiluminescent substrate for visualization (ECL kit, Thermo Scientific). Unless otherwise stated, all data are expressed as mean ± S.D. Statistical analysis was performed using Statview software (SAS Institute Inc.) except for Student's t tests, which were performed in Microsoft Excel. Comparison of control with treated groups was performed with Student's t test, and for comparison of multiple treatments in the same group with a control, one-way ANOVA with a post hoc Tukey's test was used. As a first approach, we determined if partially purified UCP3 protein could be covalently modified with the two agents BIAM and BioGEE in vitro. BIAM is routinely used to test the presence of reactive cysteines on proteins, whereas BioGEE, a cell-permeable glutathione molecule attached to biotin, is used to test if proteins can be glutathionylated. We found that UCP3 was readily recovered following BIAM treatment and streptavidin pull-down (Fig. 1a). By maintaining the cysteines in a reduced state or by blocking the cysteines with NEM, the yield of UCP3 in the pull-down was significantly diminished, confirming the presence of reactive cysteines in this protein (Fig. 1a). Similar observations were made with BioGEE (Fig. 1a). The level of recoverable UCP3 following BioGEE treatment was decreased substantially by the reducing and blocking agents DTT and NEM, revealing the requirement of cysteines for the conjugation of GSH to UCP3 (Fig. 1a). Glutathionylation of proteins has been shown to be mediated by GRx, a thiol-rich enzyme involved in antioxidative defense (34Gallogly M.M. Starke D.W. Mieyal J.J. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2009; 11: 1059-1081Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Incubation of UCP3 with GRx1 and GSH prior to BioGEE treatment and pull-down with streptavidin significantly diminished the recovery of UCP3 (Fig. 1b). In contrast, incubations performed in the absence of GRx1 increased UCP3 recovery following BioGEE treatment and streptavidin pull-down. These data indicate that the glutathionylation of UCP3 is enzymatically mediated in vitro by the GSH exchanger, GRx. We next tested whether BioGEE could covalently modify UCP3 in mitochondria from skeletal muscle. Mitochondria were treated with BioGEE and then tested for biotin content by immunoblot using anti-biotin antibodies. Immunoblotting for BioGEE-modified mitochondrial proteins revealed bands at ∼34 kDa, which corresponds to the electrophoretic mobility of UCP3 (Fig. 1c). Moreover, these immunoreactive bands were only detected in mitochondria from WT mice. Furthermore, a slight shift in the electrophoretic mobility of UCP3 in the BioGEE-treated WT mitochondria was observed. This is most likely due to the covalent modification of this protein with BioGEE (Fig. 1c). Detection of BioGEE-modified proteins with anti-biotin antibodies also revealed a number of other immunoreactive bands at a range of molecular weights indicating that a number of mitochondrial proteins can be modified by GSH in skeletal muscle mitochondria. This is not surprising because the mitochondrial proteome is known to be very susceptible to glutathionylation (35Hurd T.R. Costa N.J. Dahm C.C. Beer S.M. Brown S.E. Filipovska A. Murphy M.P. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2005; 7: 999-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). To confirm that UCP3 is glutathionylated and to identify the"

However, the relatively short-lived expansion in nuclear collisions allows antimatter to decouple quickly from matter, and avoid annihilation. Thus, a high energy accelerator of heavy nuclei is an efficient means of producing and studying antimatter. The antimatter helium-4 nucleus ($^4\bar{He}$), also known as the anti-{\alpha} ($\bar{\alpha}$), consists of two antiprotons and two antineutrons (baryon number B=-4). It has not been observed previously, although the {\alpha} particle was identified a century ago by Rutherford and is present in cosmic radiation at the 10% level. Antimatter nuclei with B < -1 have been observed only as rare products of interactions at particle accelerators, where the rate of antinucleus production in high-energy collisions decreases by about 1000 with each additional antinucleon. We present the observation of the antimatter helium-4 nucleus, the heaviest observed antinucleus. In total 18 $^4\bar{He}$ counts were detected at the STAR experiment at RHIC in 10$^9$ recorded Au+Au collisions at center-of-mass energies of 200 GeV and 62 GeV per nucleon-nucleon pair. The yield is consistent with expectations from thermodynamic and coalescent nucleosynthesis models, which has implications beyond nuclear physics."

https://openalex.org/W1988160514,"Three novel human insulin-releasing cell lines designated 1.1B4, 1.4E7, and 1.1E7 were generated by electrofusion of freshly isolated of human pancreatic beta cells and the immortal human PANC-1 epithelial cell line. Functional studies demonstrated glucose sensitivity and responsiveness to known modulators of insulin secretion. Western blot, RT-PCR, and immunohistochemistry showed expression of the major genes involved in proinsulin processing and the pancreatic beta cell stimulus-secretion pathway including PC1/3, PC2, GLUT-1, glucokinase, and K-ATP channel complex (Sur1 and Kir6.2) and the voltage-dependent L-type Ca2+ channel. The cells stained positively for insulin, and 1.1B4 cells were used to demonstrate specific staining for insulin, C-peptide, and proinsulin together with insulin secretory granules by electron microscopy. Analysis of metabolic function indicated intact mechanisms for glucose uptake, oxidation/utilization, and phosphorylation by glucokinase. Glucose, alanine, and depolarizing concentrations of K+ were all able to increase [Ca2+]i in at least two of the cell lines tested. Insulin secretion was also modulated by other nutrients, hormones, and drugs acting as stimulators or inhibitors in normal beta cells. Subscapular implantation of the 1.1B4 cell line improved hyperglycemia and resulted in glucose lowering in streptozotocin-diabetic SCID mice.

The restricted supply of viable human islets greatly limits the opportunity for studies of beta cell function as well as restricting the success of worldwide clinical islet transplantation programs. Generation of human pancreatic beta cell lines would provide a practically unlimited supply of pure insulin-secreting cells, which can be grown and harvested with a minimum of effort. Such human cell lines would be extremely useful in studies of pancreatic beta cell biology and potentially provide an alternative strategy to primary tissue for cellular therapy of type 1 diabetes. A large number of rodent insulinoma cell lines have been developed from transgenic animals expressing the SV40 antigen oncogene from the insulinoma gene promoter such as the MIN-6, βTC, and βHC cell lines (Refs. 1Miyazaki J.

Studies of these rodent pancreatic beta cell lines have provided the foundation for many advances in beta cell research, but generation of stable human insulin-producing cell lines would provide a fundamental progression toward testing on human-derived tissue, assisting drug development and possible clinical diabetes therapy. Despite the overwhelming impetus to produce such cell lines, it has proven to be extremely difficult when compared with the rodent model (9Efrat S. Fleisher N. LeRoith D. Olefsky J.M. Taylor S.I.

One cell line developed from a spontaneous insulinoma, grew slowly, and lost many of its differentiated characteristics (11Gueli N. Toto A. Palmieri G. Carmenini G. Delpino A. J. Exp. Clin. Cancer Res. 1987; 6: 281-285Google Scholar). Another line, HIN D8 cloned from a human insulinoma, showed significant insulin secretory response to glucose and other secretagogues, but no studies have since been reported using this cell line (12Thivolet C.

Halvorsen T. Demeterco C. Tyrberg B. Itkin-Ansari P. Loy M. Yoo S.J. Hao E. Bossie S. Levine F. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 476-483PubMed Google Scholar). This cell line grows indefinitely but loses differentiated function and the ability to express insulin. Overexpression of PDX1 was able to restore glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. A reversibly immortalized human beta cell clone termed NAKT-15 has also been produced by transfection with the SV40T antigen and cells shown to express beta cell transcription factors and rescue streptozotocin-induced diabetes in mice (19Narushima M. Kobayashi N. Okitsu T. Tanaka Y. Li S.A. Chen Y. Miki A. Tanaka K. Nakaji S. Takei K. Gutierrez A.S. Rivas-Carrillo J.D. Navarro-Alvarez N. Jun H.S. Westerman K.A. Noguchi H. Lakey J.R. Leboulch P.

However, this demonstrates that gene transfection of human beta cells is usually necessary for continued expression of insulin and other proteins required for stimulus-secretion coupling. In the present study, we have adapted the technology used to generate the novel hybrid rat BRIN-BD11 insulin-secreting cell line (7McClenaghan N.H. Barnett C.R. Ah-Sing E. Abdel-Wahab Y.H. O'Harte F.P. Yoon T.W. Swanston-Flatt S.K. Flatt P.R. Diabetes. 1996; 45: 1132-1140Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to produce immortal human beta cells. We report here the characteristics and functional properties of three novel human pancreatic beta cell clones produced by electrofusion of human beta cells with human PANC-1 epithelial cells (20Lieber M. Mazzetta J. Nelson-Rees W. Kaplan M. Todaro G. Int. J. Cancer. 1975; 15: 741-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). These cell lines are stable in culture and exhibit many functional attributes of human beta cells. Cultured human islets from two donors aged 25 and 28 were sent by overnight courier from Barcelona to Coleraine. Ethical approval for use of this material was gained from relevant bodies in Spain and the United Kingdom. The cell fusion partner PANC-1 (20Lieber M. Mazzetta J. Nelson-Rees W. Kaplan M. Todaro G. Int. J. Cancer. 1975; 15: 741-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar) was obtained from the European Collection of Cell Cultures (ECACC, Salisbury, England) and rendered HAT 4The abbreviations used are: HAThypoxanthine/aminopterin/thymidineIBMXisobutylmethylxanthine. (hypoxanthine/aminopterin/thymidine)-sensitive by culture in RPMI 1640 culture medium containing 0.13 mm 8-azaguanine for 25 days until azaguanine-resistant cells were isolated. HAT selectivity was used to carefully select immortal partner cells for electrofusion. hypoxanthine/aminopterin/thymidine isobutylmethylxanthine. Islet cells from dispersed human islets and PANC-1 cells were mixed at a ratio of 1:1 and pipetted into a helical chamber (Biojet, B. Braun Biotech International GmbH). Electrofusion was carried out at 7 V, 2 MHz of AC field for 30 s followed by 60 V, triple pulses of 15-s duration times of DC field. The cells were then exposed to 7 V, 2 MHz of AC field for 30 s to allow post-fusion alignment. Cells were incubated overnight at 37 °C in RPMI 1640 culture medium supplemented with HAT (0.1 mm hypoxanthine, 0.4 μm aminopterin, 16 μm thymidine), which was replaced after 24 h, and the cells were maintained in this selective medium for 10 days. The cell fusion mixture was then maintained in medium supplemented with hypoxanthine (0.1 mm) and thymidine (16 μm) until colonies of hybrids were seen under microscopic observation. This procedure was repeated for the second batch of human islets, designated as Fusion 1 and Fusion 2, respectively (Fig. 1). Colonies of hybrid cells from Fusions 1 and 2 appeared 10–20 days after electrofusion and were maintained until 25–30 days, when the medium was replaced 24 h before screening. Aliquots of 200 μl of culture medium were removed in duplicate for insulin measurement. Correction for insulin or interfering substances was made using media similarly taken from parental PANC-1 cells. The first screening procedure resulted in the detection of five insulin-positive hybrids and hybrid cells with the highest insulin output (in Fig. 1, designated X and Y from Fusions 1 and 2, respectively) were harvested and divided into cloning wells. After a further 20–30 days, this resulted in the production of 19 hybrid clones from Fusion 1, 10 of which were insulin-positive, and 22 hybrid clones from Fusion 2, nine of which were insulin-positive. Of these 19 insulin-positive clones, a final selection of three clones with the highest insulin output was made, and these were designated 1.1B4, 1.1E7, and 1.4E7. These cell lines have been deposited and authenticated by ECACC, from where they are available on application. Cells were cultured at 37 °C in 5% CO2 and 95% air in RPMI 1640 culture medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum and antibiotics (100 units/ml penicillin and 0.1 g/liter streptomycin) using 150-cm2 vented Iwaki tissue culture flasks (Bibby Sterilin, Ltd., Stone, Staffordshire, UK). Cells were routinely passaged by washing with 2 × 10 ml Hanks' balanced saline solution (Invitrogen) prior to detachment with 0.25% (w/v) trypsin/EDTA (Invitrogen) and splitting at a 1:3 ratio. Monolayers were harvested 24 h prior to experimentation, and 250,000 cells were seeded in each well of 24-well multiplates (Iwaki Glass). After attachment overnight, medium was removed, and 1 ml of Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer (7McClenaghan N.H. Barnett C.R. Ah-Sing E. Abdel-Wahab Y.H. O'Harte F.P. Yoon T.W. Swanston-Flatt S.K. Flatt P.R. Diabetes. 1996; 45: 1132-1140Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), supplemented with 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 1.1 mm glucose, was added to each well. After a 40-min preincubation, test incubations were performed for 60 min in 1 ml of Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer supplemented with established modulators of beta cell function. Aliquots were removed and stored at −20 °C until analysis. Acid ethanol extracts were prepared for determination of hormone content. Insulin was measured by radioimmunoassay (21Flatt P.R. Bailey C.J. Diabetologia. 1981; 20: 573-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar) using a human insulin standard. The antibody employed cross-reacts fully with proinsulin. Human proinsulin was determined using a human total proinsulin ELISA kit (Linco Research), which detects intact human proinsulin with no cross-reactivity with either human insulin or C-peptide. Cells were plated onto poly-l-lysine-coated glass slides (BDH/Merck) and cultured overnight to allow attachment. After fixation in ice-cold 4% paraformaldehyde (BDH/Merck)/PBS, cells were permeabilized with 0.3% Triton X-100 before incubation with the primary antibodies: human insulin monoclonal antibody (AbD Serotec, Oxford, UK, 1:100); GLUT-1 affinity-purified polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, 1:100); amylin rabbit antiserum (Peninsula Laboratories Inc., Belmont, CA, 1:200); glucokinase polyclonal antiserum, (gift from Prof. Sigurd Lenzen, Hannover, Germany, 1:1000); human C-peptide monoclonal antibody (Bachem, St. Helens, UK, 1:5000); and human proinsulin monoclonal antibody (Hytest, 1:500), all carried out overnight at 4 °C. After washing, cells were incubated with either Alexa Fluor 488 fluorescein anti-rabbit IgG (H+L) or anti-mouse IgG (H+L) made in goat (Molecular Probes) at a dilution of 1:200 in PBS for 45 min at 37 °C before mounting and visualization of positive staining using an IX51 Olympus microscope, with images recorded using the PC Imagedok program. Immunohistochemistry was also performed with antibodies for glucagon (monoclonal antibody, Sigma, 1:1000), human somatostatin (polyclonal antibody, Peninsula Laboratories Inc., 1:200), and human pancreatic polypeptide (polyclonal antibody, Abcam, Cambridge, UK, 1:500). No positive staining for these islet peptides was detected in any of the cell lines tested (data not shown). Human-specific antibodies were used where possible, as indicated above. Total RNA from the hybrid cell lines, parental PANC-1 cells, and rat pancreas and liver was isolated with TRI Reagent (Sigma), and RNA was measured using a NanoDrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). RT-PCR was performed on a Bio-Rad Gene Cycler using 100 ng of RNA (supplemental Table 1). PCR products were run on a 2% ethidium bromide agarose gel, and images were taken with the Kodak Imagedok program. 1.1B4 cells were fixed with half-strength Karnovsky fixative (22Karnovsky M.J. J. Cell Biol. 1965; 27: 137-138Google Scholar), washed, and then post-fixed in 1% OsO4/0.1 m cacodylate buffer. Alcohol-dehydrated cells were incubated in 50:50 (v/v) propylene oxide/araldite prior to resin embedding. Ultrathin microtome sections (60/70 nm thick) were cut (Ultra-cut, Leica, Milton Keynes, UK), mounted on 200-mesh copper grids (Agar Scientific Ltd., Stansted, UK), and stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate (BDH) and viewed on an FEI Tecnai 12 electron microscope. Soluble cytoplasmic and membrane fractions were obtained from 15 × 106 cells for assessment of glucokinase and GLUT-1 proteins. 100 μg of samples was denatured by heating at 100 °C, and electrophoresis was performed at a constant current of 40 mA, 120 V and then 350 mA, 100 V for 90 min using the Bio-Rad Transblot system (Richmond, CA). Incubation was performed for 1 h with the primary GLUT-1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or glucokinase antibody (S. Lenzen, Hannover, Germany), both at 1:1000 dilution, followed by incubation with HRP-labeled antibody (Amersham Biosciences) diluted 1: 1000, and finally, streptavidin-HRP (horse radish peroxidase) conjugate (diluted 1:1500). Protein expression was visualized using the Amersham Biosciences enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection system using Hyperfilm ECL (Amersham Biosciences). Cellular uptake of 1 μCi/ml 3-O-methyl-d-[1-3H]glucose (Amersham Biosciences) at 1.1 or 16.7 mm d-glucose was assessed at 37 °C. The reaction was terminated by three rapid washes with 0.5 ml of ice-cold buffer containing 100 mm glucose, and cells were lysed with 1 ml of 0.5% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). Counts in lysates were quantified by liquid scintillation counting (Wallac 1409 liquid scintillation counter). Rates of cellular glucose-phosphorylating activity in the soluble cytoplasmic fractions (from the 45,000-rpm centrifugation step) were assayed at 37 °C (23Lenzen S. Tiedge M. Panten U. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1986; 35: 2841-2843Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Hexokinase activity was assayed in the presence of 1 mm d-glucose and subtracted from the total activity recorded at 100 mm d-glucose to give glucokinase activity. One unit of enzyme activity was defined as 1 μmol of glucose 6-phosphate formed from glucose and ATP per minute at 37 °C. For oxidative glucose metabolism, 2.0 × 105 cells were incubated at 1.1 or 16.7 mm glucose plus 0.25 μCi of d-[U-14C]glucose (24Jarrett R.J. Keen H. Lancet. 1966; 1: 633-635Abstract PubMed Google Scholar). Glucose utilization was determined similarly using d-[5-3H]glucose. The reactions were stopped by the addition of 0.2 m HCl (50 μl) and 14CO2- or 3H2O-labeled radioactivity determined by scintillation counting. Cells were incubated for 2 h with colchicine (0.2 ml/10 ml), washed, and resuspended by the dropwise addition of ice-cold fixative (3:1 methanol:acetic acid). Chromosomes were spread by dropping the suspension from a height of 1.0–1.5 m onto an ice-cold microscope slide held at an angle of 45°, stained with freshly prepared Giemsa stain, and visualized with the IX51 Olympus microscope. Cells were seeded at 1.0 × 105 cells/well as monolayers into 96-well black-walled, clear bottom microplates (Greiner Bio-One, Gloucestershire, UK) and allowed to attach overnight. After washing, 100 μl of Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer was added to each well for 10 min before the addition of 100 μl of the FLIPR calcium assay kit (Molecular Devices) at 37 °C (25Miguel J.C. Patterson S. Abdel-Wahab Y.H. Mathias P.C. Flatt P.R. Cell Calcium. 2004; 36: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Fluorometric data were acquired using the FlexStationTM (Molecular Devices). Adult female SCID mice (18–22 g) were made diabetic by intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin (Sigma) at 180 mg/kg of body weight (as indicated in Fig. 9B, day −14). 1.1B4 cells were harvested and resuspended in RPMI 1640 culture medium. Diabetic mice (n = 5) were given a single subscapular injection of 5 × 106 cells in 100 μl of tissue culture medium. Control mice (n = 4) received medium alone. Blood glucose was measured using the FreeStyle MiniTM kit and strips (TheraSense Inc., Alameda, CA). An intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test (18 mmol/kg) was performed on selected mice at day 20 after cell transplantation. The experiment was terminated at day 28 when body weight, plasma glucose, and insulin were determined together with examination of tissue at the original implantation site. Results are expressed as mean ± S.E. Values were compared using one-way analysis of variance followed by Dunnett's test. Groups of data were considered to be significantly different if p < 0.05. 1.1B4, 1.1E7, 1.4E7, and parental PANC-1 cells grew as monolayers taking on a pavement pattern (Fig. 2, A–D). Karyotyping showed cells to exhibit between 66 and 67 chromosomes (supplemental Table 2). The human cox-1 gene, used as a marker of human species identity, was expressed in all four cell lines (Fig. 2I, lanes 1–4). No expression was found in mouse pancreas (lane 6). All human islet hybrid cell lines showed consistent growth patterns with approximate doubling times of 23–26 h when compared with 21 ± 1.6 h for non-fused PANC-1 cells (supplemental Table 2). Each clonal cell line exhibited positive staining for insulin (Fig. 2, E–G) with cellular insulin content at passage 17 between 3.5 and 3.9 ng/106 cells (supplemental Table 2). There was no significant change in insulin content by passage 40 (3.2–4.1 ng/106 cells). PANC-1 cells did not contain immunoreactive insulin (supplemental Table 2 and Fig. 2H). If maintained in suspension culture rather than as monolayers, 1.1B4 cells formed pseudoislet-like structures (Fig. 2J). Evaluation of 1.1B4 cells by transmission electron micrographs revealed dark insulin granules in the cytoplasm and external cell surface (Fig. 2K). The three hybrid cell lines released 9–10% of cellular insulin during acute 60-min incubation (supplemental Table 2). In 1.1B4 cells, insulin, proinsulin, and C-peptide were each visualized using human-specific antibodies (Fig. 3, A–C). Islet amyloid polypeptide was also detected in the cytoplasm (Fig. 3D). Higher magnification phase contrast and fluorescence microscopy of the same cells show the location of cytoplasmic expression of human insulin (Fig. 3, E and F.) The presence of intact human proinsulin was demonstrated by ELISA in all three beta cell lines but not in PANC-1 cells, with a ratio of cellular proinsulin to insulin between 1:20 and 1:23 (Fig. 3G). RT-PCR analysis also confirmed expression of the human beta cell prohormone convertases PC1/3 and PC2 and the PC2-binding protein 7B2 in these cells (Fig. 3H, lanes 1–3). PANC-1 cells did not show expression of PC1/3 and PC2, although there was faint expression for 7B2 (Fig. 3H, lane 4).FIGURE 3A–D, fluorescence immunohistochemistry in the 1.1B4 cell line using antibodies specific to human insulin (A), human proinsulin (B), human C-peptide (C), and islet amyloid polypeptide (D). E and F, phase contrast high magnification image of two 1.1B4 cells (E) and the same cells under fluorescence showing the location of insulin in the cell cytoplasm as bright punctate spots (F). Positive staining is seen in all panels as bright spots of staining in the cell cytoplasm. Slides were analyzed by fluorescence microscopy using an IX51 Olympus microscope (×20 magnification, A–D; ×60 magnification, E and F). G and H, the ratio of human proinsulin:insulin content is shown for all three clonal hybrid cell lines (G) along with RT-PCR expression of the prohormone convertases PC1/3, PC2, and its binding protein 7B2 in 1.1B4, 1.1E7, 1.4E7, and parental PANC-1 cell lines (lanes 1–4, respectively) (H). p17, passage 17.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Each cell line showed a different pattern and magnitude of responsiveness to acute glucose challenge (Fig. 4, A–C). 1.1B4 cells exhibited a stepwise 2.3-fold insulin secretory response over the range 0–16.7 mm glucose, with a threshold at 5.6 mm glucose (Fig. 4A). Both 1.1E7 and 1.4E7 cells showed maximal 1.6- and 1.5-fold secretory response to glucose at 11.1 and 5.6 mm glucose, respectively (Fig. 4, B and C). Inclusion of 200 μmol/IBMX significantly increased the secretory responses by 20–100% (p < 0.001; Fig. 4, D–F). No significant differences were recorded between passages 17 and 40 in terms of basal insulin release and secretory responsiveness to glucose or KCl (supplemental Table 3). Western blot revealed expression of GLUT-1 glucose transporter protein in membranes of the hybrid cell lines (Fig. 5), with very low levels seen in parental PANC-1 cells. Fluorescence immunohistochemistry visualized GLUT-1 transporter expression in the cytoplasm, whereas no positive staining was detected in PANC-1 cells (Fig. 5, B–E). As shown in Fig. 5, F–H, the hybrid cell lines exhibited markedly enhanced glucose transport profiles at 16.7 mm when compared with 1.1 mm glucose or when compared with PANC-1 cells. Western blot with specific glucokinase antibody detected a 50-kDa protein in each electrofusion-derived cell line (Fig. 6A). Using fluorescence immunohistochemistry, glucokinase protein was visualized as small punctate spots in the cytoplasm of these cells (Fig. 6, B–D). No glucokinase expression was detected in PANC-1 cells (Fig. 6, A and E), and the three novel cell lines exhibited significantly higher (p < 0.01 to p < 0.001) glucokinase and lower (p < 0.01 to p < 0.001) hexokinase activity when compared with PANC-1 cells (Fig. 6F). The percentage of contribution of glucokinase to total glucose-phosphorylating activity was 27–42% in 1.1B4, 1.1E7, and 1.4E7 cells when compared with less than 2% in PANC-1 cells. All three beta cell lines exhibited greater glucose oxidation rates than PANC-1 cells (supplemental Table 4). 1.1B4 and 1.4E7 cells also showed significant increases (p < 0.05) in glucose oxidation rates when comparing 1.1 with 16.7 mm glucose. Values for glucose utilization were less and did not show such appreciable differences between PANC-1 and electrofusion-derived beta cells (supplemental Table 4). The amino acids leucine, KIC, alanine, arginine, tolbutamide, and glibenclamide significantly (p < 0.05 to p < 0.001) increased insulin secretion by 1.1–1.4-fold in the three cell lines (Fig. 7, A–C). Glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), and cholecystokinin-8 (CCK-8) also significantly (p < 0.001) increased insulin release (Fig. 7, D–F). The responses to a range of known inhibitors at 16.7 mm glucose are shown in Fig. 7, G–I. The K+-ATP channel opener, diazoxide (400 μmol/liter), caused a significant 20–50% inhibition of insulin release from 1.1B4, 1.1E7, and 1.4E7 cells (p < 0.01 to p < 0.001). Inclusion of the voltage-dependent Ca2+ channel blocker, verapamil (20 μm), inhibited insulin release by 20–40% (p < 0.05 to p < 0.001), whereas depletion of extracellular Ca2+ using EGTA significantly decreased insulin secretion by 20–40% (p < 0.01 to p < 0.001). All three hybrid beta cell lines and PANC-1 cells expressed Kir6.2 and Sur1 as revealed by RT-PCR analysis (Fig. 8A). Measurements of intracellular [Ca2+]i following exposure to 16.7 mm glucose, a depolarizing concentration of KCl (30 mm), or 20 mm alanine are shown in Fig. 8, B–D. Glucose caused a significant increase (p < 0.001) in [Ca2+]i in both 1.1B4 and 1.4E7 cells (Fig. 8B). Such change was less evident in 1.1E7 cells. Membrane depolarization with KCl consistently evoked significant (p < 0.001) incr"
https://openalex.org/W2063206231,"The complex that excises introns from pre-messenger RNAs, the spliceosome, is composed of ribonucleoprotein subcomplexes, or snRNPs. Most snRNPs contain a core unit of seven Sm proteins, an SMN (survival of motor neurons) chaperone, and an snRNA specific to each snRNP. Leung et al. have solved the structure of the U4 snRNP core. Comparison with a lower-resolution U1 snRNP structure reveals how different snRNAs induce structural changes that permit association of accessory factors that distinguish the various snRNPs. The spliceosome is a dynamic macromolecular machine that assembles on pre-messenger RNA substrates and catalyses the excision of non-coding intervening sequences (introns)1,2,3. Four of the five major components of the spliceosome, U1, U2, U4 and U5 small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs), contain seven Sm proteins (SmB/B′, SmD1, SmD2, SmD3, SmE, SmF and SmG) in common4,5. Following export of the U1, U2, U4 and U5 snRNAs to the cytoplasm6,7, the seven Sm proteins, chaperoned by the survival of motor neurons (SMN) complex, assemble around a single-stranded, U-rich sequence called the Sm site in each small nuclear RNA (snRNA), to form the core domain of the respective snRNP particle8,9. Core domain formation is a prerequisite for re-import into the nucleus10, where these snRNPs mature via addition of their particle-specific proteins. Here we present a crystal structure of the U4 snRNP core domain at 3.6 Å resolution, detailing how the Sm site heptad (AUUUUUG) binds inside the central hole of the heptameric ring of Sm proteins, interacting one-to-one with SmE–SmG–SmD3–SmB–SmD1–SmD2–SmF. An irregular backbone conformation of the Sm site sequence combined with the asymmetric structure of the heteromeric protein ring allows each base to interact in a distinct manner with four key residues at equivalent positions in the L3 and L5 loops of the Sm fold. A comparison of this structure with the U1 snRNP at 5.5 Å resolution11,12 reveals snRNA-dependent structural changes outside the Sm fold, which may facilitate the binding of particle-specific proteins that are crucial to biogenesis of spliceosomal snRNPs."
https://openalex.org/W1989285795,"Global environmental temperature changes threaten innumerable plant species. Although various signaling networks regulate plant responses to temperature fluctuations, the mechanisms unifying these diverse processes are largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate that an Arabidopsis monothiol glutaredoxin, AtGRXS17 (At4g04950), plays a critical role in redox homeostasis and hormone perception to mediate temperature-dependent postembryonic growth. AtGRXS17 expression was induced by elevated temperatures. Lines altered in AtGRXS17 expression were hypersensitive to elevated temperatures and phenocopied mutants altered in the perception of the phytohormone auxin. We show that auxin sensitivity and polar auxin transport were perturbed in these mutants, whereas auxin biosynthesis was not altered. In addition, atgrxs17 plants displayed phenotypes consistent with defects in proliferation and/or cell cycle control while accumulating higher levels of reactive oxygen species and cellular membrane damage under high temperature. Together, our findings provide a nexus between reactive oxygen species homeostasis, auxin signaling, and temperature responses."
https://openalex.org/W2115822290,"The plastid is a defining structure of photosynthetic eukaryotes and houses many plant-specific processes, including the light reactions, carbon fixation, pigment synthesis, and other primary metabolic processes. Identifying proteins associated with catalytic, structural, and regulatory functions that are unique to plastid-containing organisms is necessary to fully define the scope of plant biochemistry. Here, we performed phylogenomics on 20 genomes to compile a new inventory of 597 nucleus-encoded proteins conserved in plants and green algae but not in non-photosynthetic organisms. 286 of these proteins are of known function, whereas 311 are not characterized. This inventory was validated as applicable and relevant to diverse photosynthetic eukaryotes using an additional eight genomes from distantly related plants (including Micromonas, Selaginella, and soybean). Manual curation of the known proteins in the inventory established its importance to plastid biochemistry. To predict functions for the 52% of proteins of unknown function, we used sequence motifs, subcellular localization, co-expression analysis, and RNA abundance data. We demonstrate that 18% of the proteins in the inventory have functions outside the plastid and/or beyond green tissues. Although 32% of proteins in the inventory have homologs in all cyanobacteria, unexpectedly, 30% are eukaryote-specific. Finally, 8% of the proteins of unknown function share no similarity to any characterized protein and are plant lineage-specific. We present this annotated inventory of 597 proteins as a resource for functional analyses of plant-specific biochemistry."
https://openalex.org/W2036447740,"Sesquiterpene lactones (STLs) are terpenoid natural products possessing the γ-lactone, well known for their diverse biological and medicinal activities. The occurrence of STLs is sporadic in nature, but most STLs have been isolated from plants in the Asteraceae family. Despite the implication of the γ-lactone group in many reported bioactivities of STLs, the biosynthetic origins of the γ-lactone ring remains elusive. Germacrene A acid (GAA) has been suggested as a central precursor of diverse STLs. The regioselective (C6 or C8) and stereoselective (α or β) hydroxylation on a carbon of GAA adjacent to its carboxylic acid at C12 is responsible for the γ-lactone formation. Here, we report two cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (P450s) capable of catalyzing 6α- and 8β-hydroxylation of GAA from lettuce and sunflower, respectively. To identify these P450s, sunflower trichomes were isolated to generate a trichome-specific transcript library, from which 10 P450 clones were retrieved. Expression of these clones in a yeast strain metabolically engineered to synthesize substrate GAA identified a P450 catalyzing 8β-hydroxylation of GAA, but the STL was not formed by spontaneous lactonization. Subsequently, we identified the closest homolog of the GAA 8β-hydroxylase from lettuce and discovered 6α-hydroxylation of GAA by the recombinant enzyme. The resulting 6α-hydroxy-GAA spontaneously undergoes a lactonization to yield the simplest form of STL, costunolide. Furthermore, we demonstrate the milligram per liter scale de novo synthesis of costunolide using the lettuce P450 in an engineered yeast strain, an important advance that will enable exploitation of STLs. Evolution and homology models of these two P450s are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2057093156,"Using the massively parallel genetic algorithm for RNA folding, we show that the core region of the 3'-untranslated region of the dengue virus (DENV) RNA can form two dumbbell structures (5'- and 3'-DBs) of unequal frequencies of occurrence. These structures have the propensity to form two potential pseudoknots between identical five-nucleotide terminal loops 1 and 2 (TL1 and TL2) and their complementary pseudoknot motifs, PK2 and PK1. Mutagenesis using a DENV2 replicon RNA encoding the Renilla luciferase reporter indicated that all four motifs and the conserved sequence 2 (CS2) element within the 3'-DB are important for replication. However, for translation, mutation of TL1 alone does not have any effect; TL2 mutation has only a modest effect in translation, but translation is reduced by ∼60% in the TL1/TL2 double mutant, indicating that TL1 exhibits a cooperative synergy with TL2 in translation. Despite the variable contributions of individual TL and PK motifs in translation, WT levels are achieved when the complementarity between TL1/PK2 and TL2/PK1 is maintained even under conditions of inhibition of the translation initiation factor 4E function mediated by LY294002 via a noncanonical pathway. Taken together, our results indicate that the cis-acting RNA elements in the core region of DENV2 RNA that include two DB structures are required not only for RNA replication but also for optimal translation."
https://openalex.org/W2022635059,"Caveolin-1 (Cav-1), an important composition protein within the flask-shaped membrane invaginations termed caveolae, may play a role in host defense against infections. However, the phenotype in Pseudomonas aeruginosa-infected cav1 knock-out (KO) mice is still unresolved, and the mechanism involved is almost entirely unknown. Using a respiratory infection model, we confirmed a crucial role played by Cav-1 in host defense against this pathogen because Cav-1 KO mice showed increased mortality, severe lung injury, and systemic dissemination as compared with wild-type (WT) littermates. In addition, cav1 KO mice exhibited elevated inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF-α, and IL-12a), decreased phagocytic ability of macrophages, and increased superoxide release in the lung, liver, and kidney. We further studied relevant cellular signaling processes and found that STAT3 and NF-κB are markedly activated. Our data revealed that the Cav-1/STAT3/NF-κB axis is responsible for a dysregulated cytokine response, which contributes to increased mortality and disease progression. Moreover, down-regulating Cav-1 in cell culture with a dominant negative strategy demonstrated that STAT3 activation was essential for the translocation of NF-κB into the nucleus, confirming the observations from cav1 KO mice. Collectively, our studies indicate that Cav-1 is critical for inflammatory responses regulating the STAT3/NF-κB pathway and thereby impacting P. aeruginosa infection. Caveolin-1 (Cav-1), an important composition protein within the flask-shaped membrane invaginations termed caveolae, may play a role in host defense against infections. However, the phenotype in Pseudomonas aeruginosa-infected cav1 knock-out (KO) mice is still unresolved, and the mechanism involved is almost entirely unknown. Using a respiratory infection model, we confirmed a crucial role played by Cav-1 in host defense against this pathogen because Cav-1 KO mice showed increased mortality, severe lung injury, and systemic dissemination as compared with wild-type (WT) littermates. In addition, cav1 KO mice exhibited elevated inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF-α, and IL-12a), decreased phagocytic ability of macrophages, and increased superoxide release in the lung, liver, and kidney. We further studied relevant cellular signaling processes and found that STAT3 and NF-κB are markedly activated.

Collectively, our studies indicate that Cav-1 is critical for inflammatory responses regulating the STAT3/NF-κB pathway and thereby impacting P. aeruginosa infection. Pseudomonas aeruginosa accounts for 25% of Gram-negative bacteria isolated from hospitals and is associated with high morbidity and mortality (1Driscoll J.A. Brody S.L. Kollef M.H. Drugs. 2007; 67: 351-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). P. aeruginosa frequently infects immunocompromised individuals, such as those affected by ventilator-associated infection, severe burns, and cancer (2Lyczak J.B. Cannon C.L. Pier G.B. Microbes Infect. 2000; 2: 1051-1060Crossref PubMed Scopus (959) Google Scholar). More than 80% of cystic fibrosis patients suffer severe P. aeruginosa infection (3Heijerman H. J. Cyst. Fibros. 2005; 4: 3-5Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). This bacterium becomes increasingly resistant to various antibiotics. Further understanding the mechanism of the host-pathogen interaction may result in effective approaches to preventing this infection. Thus, P. aeruginosa has been a focus of airway infectious diseases (1Driscoll J.A. Brody S.L. Kollef M.H. Drugs. 2007; 67: 351-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar, 4Fagon J.Y. Chastre J.

Recent studies suggest that P. aeruginosa also invades the lung epithelial cells through lipid raft-mediated endocytosis (7Zaas D.W. Duncan M.J. Li G. Wright J.R. Abraham S.N. J. Biol.

Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2002; 165: 867-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (2133) Google Scholar). The invasion process of P. aeruginosa may involve certain lipid raft-associated proteins, including the caveolin family of proteins (9Garcia-Medina R. Dunne W.M. Singh P.K. Brody S.L. Infect. Immun. 2005; 73: 8298-8305Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar).

Caveolins are a family of integral membrane proteins involved in caveola formation and receptor-dependent endocytosis (13Scherer P.E. Okamoto T. Chun M. Nishimoto I. Lodish H.F. Lisanti M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1996; 93: 131-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar, 14Tang Z. Scherer P.E. Okamoto T. Song K. Chu C. Kohtz D.S. Nishimoto I. Lodish H.F. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol.

Cav-1 and -2 are co-expressed in various cells, such as endothelial cells, airway epithelial cells, and type I pneumocytes. Cav-1 is the major component of caveolae, flask-shaped plasma membrane invaginations. In the absence of Cav-1, Cav-2 cannot reach the plasma membrane and is degraded (16Mora R. Bonilha V.L. Marmorstein A. Scherer P.E. Brown D. Lisanti M.P. Rodriguez-Boulan E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25708-25717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Through the hetero-oligomeric complex formed between Cav-1 and Cav-2, Cav-2 can translocate to lipid rafts of the plasma membrane. The lipid rafts, also known as membrane microdomains, contain glycosphingolipids, cholesterol, and signaling/receptor proteins (17Thomas S. Preda-Pais A. Casares S. Brumeanu T.D. Mol. Immunol. 2004; 41: 399-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 18Thomas S. Kumar R.S. Brumeanu T.D. Arch. Immunol. Ther. Exp. 2004; 52: 215-224PubMed Google Scholar, 19Korade Z. Kenworthy A.K. Neuropharmacology. 2008; 55: 1265-1273Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar) and play a crucial role in many cellular activities, including airway bacterial invasion. Signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs) are SH2 domain-containing transcription factors involved in the inflammatory response in carcinogenesis and host defense (20Grivennikov S.I. Karin M.A. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2010; 21: 11-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar, 21Ivashkiv L.B.

Dis. 2006; 193: 360-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). STATs are activated through receptors for cytokines and hormones, and these receptors do not contain any intrinsic enzymatic activity; thus, they depend on tyrosine kinases that can interact with the intracellular domain of the receptor. STAT signaling is initiated by phosphorylating and activating Janus kinases (JAKs), which in turn lead to phosphorylation of tyrosine residues on receptors (24Wang L. Kurosaki T. Corey S.J. Oncogene. 2007; 26: 2851-2859Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). These receptors serve as docking sites for STATs. Suppressors of cytokine signaling (SOCSs) function as negative regulators of STATs and operate by binding and inhibiting JAKs or competing with STATs for phosphotyrosine binding sites on cytokine receptors (25Norkina O. Dolganiuc A. Catalano D. Kodys K. Mandrekar P. Syed A. Efros M. Szabo G. Alcohol Clin. Exp. Res. 2008; 32: 1565-1573Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Recently, STAT3 was found to interact with Cav-1 and heat shock protein 90 in plasma membrane rafts during Escherichia coli infection (26Maruvada R. Argon Y. Prasadarao N.V. Cell. Microbiol. 2008; 10: 2326-2338Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Cav-1 is also related to a JAK2/STAT5 pathway because Cav-1 is homologous to the pseudosubstrate for SOCS. Thus, Cav-1 may down-regulate JAK/STAT pathways, modulating the proinflammatory response. Because Cav-1 was found to be associated with STAT3 in lipid rafts by a co-localization study, it is also possible that a Cav-1 cascade may impact the PI3K/Akt pathway through molecular interactions, which may serve as a regulator for STAT3 (27Shen-Tu G. Schauer D.B. Jones N.L. Sherman P.M. Lab. Invest. 2010; 90: 266-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Thus, Cav-1 may help maintain the balance between host response and tissue damage that may be caused by overproduction of inflammatory cytokines. To better characterize the role of Cav-1 in P. aeruginosa infection, we sought to determine the pathogenic mechanism in cav1 KO mice. We found that cav1 KO mice manifested more severe infection, including increased bacterial burdens, inflammation, oxidative stress, and susceptibility to infection. Our studies also showed that the STAT3/NF-κB pathway is responsible for the dysregulated response during P. aeruginosa infection. KO and wild-type (WT) control mice (B6129SF2/J) were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME) (28Drab M. Verkade P. Elger M. Kasper M. Lohn M. Lauterbach B. Menne J. Lindschau C. Mende F. Luft F.C. Schedl A. Haller H. Kurzchalia T.V. Science. 2001; 293: 2449-2452Crossref PubMed Scopus (1292) Google Scholar). Mice were housed and bred in the animal facility at the University of North Dakota, and the animal experiments were performed in accordance with the institutional animal care and use committee guidelines. We anesthetized mice with 45 mg/kg ketamine and intranasally instilled 0.5 × 107 (PAK; six mice/group) to 1 × 107 (PAO1) colony-forming units (cfu) of P. aeruginosa, and mice were killed when they were moribund (29Kannan S. Audet A. Huang H. Chen L.J. Wu M. J. Immunol. 2008; 180: 2396-2408Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). After bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), the trachea and lung were excised for homogenization or fixed in 10% formalin. Mouse AM cells were isolated by BAL as described (30Wisniowski P.E. Spech R.W. Wu M. Doyle N.A. Pasula R. Martin 2nd, W.J. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2000; 162: 733-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). AM cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% newborn calf serum and penicillin/streptomycin antibiotics in a 5% CO2 incubator. MLE-12 cells were obtained from ATCC and maintained following the manufacturer's instructions. P. aeruginosa strain PAO1 WT was a gift from S. Lory (Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA). PAK and PAO1-GFP were obtained from G. Pier (Channing Laboratory, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA) (31Priebe G.P. Brinig M.M. Hatano K. Grout M. Coleman F.T. Pier G.B. Goldberg J.B. Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 1507-1517Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Bacteria were grown overnight in Luria-Bertani (LB) broth at 37 °C with vigorous shaking. The next day, the bacteria were pelleted by centrifugation at 5,000 × g, resuspended in 10 ml of fresh LB broth, and allowed to grow until the midlogarithmic phase. Optical density (OD) at 600 nm was measured, and density was adjusted to 653,740.25 OD (0.1 OD = 1 × 108 cells/ml). Cells were washed once with PBS after overnight culture in serum-containing medium and changed to serum-free and antibiotic-free medium immediately before infection (29Kannan S. Audet A. Huang H. Chen L.J. Wu M. J. Immunol. 2008; 180: 2396-2408Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Except for dose determination assays, cells were infected by P. aeruginosa in a multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of 10:1 bacteria-cell ratio for the indicated time points. MLE-12 cells were transfected with yellow fluorescent protein (YFP)-Cav-1 and YFP-Cav-1Δ51–169 dominant negative (DN) plasmids using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) in serum-free RPMI 1640 medium following the manufacturer's instruction. The cells were lysed after 24 h of transient expression (32Kannan S. Audet A. Knittel J. Mullegama S. Gao G.F. Wu M. Eur. J. Immunol. 2006; 36: 1739-1752Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Cytokine concentrations were measured by an ELISA kit (eBioscience Co., San Diego, CA) in samples of cell culture medium, BAL fluid, and lung homogenates collected at the indicated times after infection. The MLE-12 cells were treated as described above. Culture medium was collected after infection. For BAL fluid, the trachea was surgically exposed and cannulated, lungs were lavaged five times with 1.0-ml volume of lavage fluid, the lavageates were pooled, and cells were removed by centrifugation. For lung homogenates, excised lungs were ground in 500 μl of PBS. 96-well plates (Corning Costar 9018) were coated with 100 μl/well capture antibody in coating buffer and incubated overnight at 4 °C (33Kannan S. Huang H. Seeger D. Audet A. Chen Y. Huang C. Gao H. Li S. Wu M. PLoS One. 2009; 4: e4891Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). 100-μl aliquots of serum samples were added to the coated microtiter wells. The cytokine concentrations were determined with corresponding detection HRP-conjugated antibodies. The values were read at 450 nm and analyzed. Mouse monoclonal Abs against Cav-1, phospho-STAT3, IL-6, and NF-κB; rabbit polyclonal Ab against phospho-NF-κB; and goat polyclonal Abs against TNF-α and SOCS3 were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. Rabbit monoclonal Ab against glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was from Cell Signaling Technology. The samples derived from cells and lung homogenates were lysed and quantitated. The lysates were boiled for 5 min, and protease inhibitor mixture was added. The supernatants were collected, and an equal amount of each sample was loaded onto 10% SDS-polyacrylamide minigels and electrophoresed to resolve proteins. The proteins were then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Pierce) and blocked for 2 h at room temperature using 5% nonfat milk blocking buffer. Membranes were incubated overnight at 4 °C with appropriate first antibodies diluted at 1:1,000 in 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) Western antibody buffer. After washing three times with washing solution, the antigen-antibody complexes were incubated for 45 min at room temperature with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Rockland Immunochemicals, Gilbertsville, PA) diluted 1:2,000 (34Wu M. Stockley P.G. Martin 2nd, W.J. Electrophoresis. 2002; 23: 2373-2376Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Signals were visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit (SuperSignal West Pico, Pierce). RNA was extracted from lung homogenates and cells with TRIzol (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For detected genes, RT was performed using 1.5 μg of RNA, RNase ribonuclease inhibitor, oligo(dT), and cloned avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). PCR products were separated by 1.0% agarose gel electrophoresis containing ethidium bromide and visualized under UV light. The results for each gene were normalized in comparison with GAPDH expression (35Wu M. Harvey K.A. Ruzmetov N. Welch Z.R. Sech L. Jackson K. Stillwell W. Zaloga G.P. Siddiqui R.A. Int. J. Cancer. 2005; 117: 340-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Cells were grown either on coverslips in a 24-well plate or in glass bottom dishes (MatTek, Ashland, MA). For immunostaining, the cells were fixed in 3.7% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS, and the nonspecific binding site was blocked with blocking buffer for 30 min. Cells were incubated with primary Abs at a 1:500 dilution in blocking buffer for 1 h and washed three times with wash buffer. After incubation with appropriate fluorophore-conjugated secondary Abs, the coverslips were mounted on slides with VECTASHIELD mounting medium (36Kannan S. Pang H. Foster D.C. Rao Z. Wu M. Cell Death Differ. 2006; 13: 311-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). DAPI (Sigma-Aldrich) was used to stain the nucleus. The images were captured by an LSM 510 Meta confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging, Thornwood, NY) and processed using the software provided by the manufacturer. Transient transfections were performed with 2 × 105 cells plated in 6-well plates by using 2 μg of DNA and 3 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) in serum-free RPMI 1640 medium following the manufacturer's instruction. 24 h after transfection, the cells were infected with PAK at 10:1 m.o.i. for 1 h (37Yan C. Cao J. Wu M. Zhang W. Jiang T. Yoshimura A. Gao H. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 37227-37239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Cell lysates were subjected to luciferase activity analysis by using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega, Madison, WI). This assay measures the color change of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-dimethyltetrazolium bromide upon reduction by enzymes to assess the viability of cells. BAL fluid was centrifuged, and cells were cultured in a 96-well plate. After incubation with P. aeruginosa, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-dimethyltetrazolium bromide dye was added at a final concentration of 1 μg/ml per well. The cells were incubated at 37 °C for 60 min or until the color change occurred. The dye is yellow in color and upon reduction by enzymes forms a blue formazan product. The reaction was stopped by adding 100 μl of stop solution (10% DMSO, 10% SDS in 50 mm HEPES buffer). The plate was left at room temperature overnight for complete dissolution of formazan crystals. The next day, the plate was read at 560-nm absorbance using a plate reader to quantify the dye conversion (38Wu M. Brown W.L. Stockley P.G. Bioconjug. Chem. 1995; 6: 587-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Duplicates were done for each sample and control. Background correction was done with blanks containing dye alone. This assay is based on the color change of NBT dye upon reduction by released superoxide. Cells were treated as above, and same amount of dye as used above was added. The dye is yellow in color and upon reduction by superoxide forms a blue formazan product (39Wu M. Huang H. Zhang W. Kannan S. Weaver A. McKibben M. Herington D. Zeng H. Gao H. Infect. Immun. 2011; 79: 75-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Dihydrodichlorofluorescein diacetate dye (Molecular Probes, Carlsbad, CA) does not normally fluoresce but emits green fluorescence upon reaction with superoxide inside cells. Cells were treated as above, and an equal amount(s) of dye was added. After a 10-min incubation, fluorescence was measured using a fluorometer (BioTek, Winooski, VT) (39Wu M. Huang H. Zhang W. Kannan S. Weaver A. McKibben M. Herington D. Zeng H. Gao H. Infect. Immun. 2011; 79: 75-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 40Wu M. Audet A. Cusic J. Seeger D. Cochran R. Ghribi O. J. Neurochem. 2009; 111: 1011-1021Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Malondialdehyde is an end product of the lipid peroxidation process and was measured in a colorimetric assay (Calbiochem) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Homogenized lung tissue in 62.5 mm Tris-HCl (pH = 6.8) supplemented with Complete Mini protease inhibitor (Roche Diagnostics) in equal protein amounts was used in the assay. Duplicates were done for each sample and control (41Kannan S. Huang H. Seeger D. Audet A. Chen Y. Huang C. Gao H. Li S. Wu M. PLoS One. 2009; 4: e4891Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). AM cells obtained from BAL fluid were plated in 96-well plates and grown overnight. The cells were treated with the serum-free medium for 1 h. Then GFP-PAO1 was used to infect the cells at 10:1 m.o.i. After a 1-h incubation at 37 °C, the wells were washed and treated with 100 μg/ml polymyxin B for 1 h to kill any remaining extracellular bacteria (29Kannan S. Audet A. Huang H. Chen L.J. Wu M. J. Immunol. 2008; 180: 2396-2408Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The number of phagocytosed bacteria was counted using a Synergy HT fluorometer (BioTek) with 485 ± 20-nm excitation and 528 ± 20-nm emission filters. Background correction was done for autofluorescence. Duplicates were done for each sample and control. Alternatively, classical colony-forming units were counted to quantitate phagocytosis as described previously. The MPO assay was performed as follows. Samples were homogenized in 50 mm hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide, 50 mm KH2PO4, pH 6.0, 0.5 mm EDTA at 1 ml/100 mg of tissue and centrifuged for 15 min at 12,000 rpm at 4 °C. Supernatants were decanted, and 100 ml of reaction buffer (0.167 mg/ml O-dianisidine, 50 mm KH2PO4, pH 6.0, 0.0005% mm H2O2) were added to 100 ml of sample. Absorbance was read at 460 nm at 2-min intervals. Duplicates were done for each sample and control (41Kannan S. Huang H. Seeger D. Audet A. Chen Y. Huang C. Gao H. Li S. Wu M. PLoS One. 2009; 4: e4891Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). AM cells from BAL fluid and ground lung, spleen, liver, and kidney tissues were homogenized with PBS and spread on LB plates to enumerate levels of bacteria. The plates were cultured in a 37 °C incubator overnight, and colonies were counted. Duplicates were done for each sample and control. Lung tissues were fixed in 10% formalin and then embedded in paraffin using a routine histologic procedure. Four-micrometer sections were cut, stained by standard H&E, and examined for differences in morphology postinfection (42Wu M. Hussain S. He Y.H. Pasula R. Smith P.A. Martin 2nd, W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 14589-14594Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). All experiments were performed in triplicate and repeated at least three times. Data are presented as percent changes compared with the controls ±S.D. from the three independent experiments. Group means were compared by one-way ANOVA (Tukey's post hoc) using SPSS software, and a difference was accepted at p < 0.05 (39Wu M. Huang H. Zhang W. Kannan S. Weaver A. McKibben M. Herington D. Zeng H. Gao H. Infect. Immun. 2011; 79: 75-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The survival test was represented by Kaplan-Meier survival curves using SPSS software. To determine the role of Cav-1 in P. aeruginosa infection, we intranasally instilled PAK (0.5 × 107 cfu/mouse) to cav1 KO and WT mice (with otherwise similar genetic backgrounds). As shown in Fig. 1, cav1 KO mice exhibited increased lethality (50% cav1 KO mice died within 24 h postinfection). At 60 h, all KO mice died, whereas 50% of the WT control mice remained alive. The result is represented by Kaplan-Meier survival curves (p = 0.017, log rank test). These findings suggest that Cav-1 is required for host defense in P. aeruginosa infection in acute pneumonia models. To fully analyze the cause of the lethality, moribund mice were killed, and organs were aseptically removed for various assays. Lung homogenates were used to measure bacterial burdens. Cav-1 KO mice showed significantly increased colony-forming units of PAK in the lung tissue and AM cells when compared with WT mice (Fig. 2A; p < 0.001, one-way ANOVA), indicating severe lung injury and pneumonia. To quantitatively determine polymorphonuclear neutrophil (PMN) infiltration, BAL fluid and serum were analyzed for the percentage of PMN cells. PMN penetration to the lung was increased in the BAL fluid and serum of cav1 KO mice when compared with WT mice (Fig. 2, B and C). P. aeruginosa infection was previously shown to induce the release of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in lung, which may accumulate and eventually cause lung injury (43Suntres Z.E. Omri A. Shek P.N. Microb. Pathog. 2002; 32: 27-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). To measure this oxidative stress, cav1 KO and WT mice were infected by PAK, and AM cells were obtained. Compared with WT mice, AM cells of cav1 KO mice showed increased oxidative stress 18 h postinfection as determined by NBT assays (Fig. 2D). These results were further confirmed using the dihydrodichlorofluorescein diacetate assay (Fig. 2E), a sensitive fluorescence method for quantifying superoxide. Moreover, a decreased mitochondrial membrane potential was also observed in cav1 KO mice as compared with WT mice using JC-1 fluorescence assays (Fig. 2F), indicating that increased oxidation resulted in apoptotic cell death. These data collectively suggest that increased ROS may hamper cell survival by increasing apoptosis and may significantly damage the lung and other organs. These results are consistent with the increased PMN penetration in the lung and serum in cav1 KO mice (Fig. 2, B and C). Under P. aeruginosa infection, PMNs are expected to infiltrate into the lung to clear bacteria through ROS and proteases. Although bacterial clearance is dependent in part on the production of ROS, excessive ROS accumulation may cause lung injury. As a direct indicator of lung injury, lung histology was examined 18 h post-PAK infection. Although both cav1 KO mice and WT control mice showed signs of pneumonia, significant histological alterations and increased PMN infiltration were only observed in the lungs of cav1 KO mice, indicating more severe lung injury in these animals (Fig. 2G). The insets demonstrate the typical regions with serious tissue damage or inflammatory response. A logical question is whether or not the intranasal inoculation only caused a local infection within the lung. Using tissue homogenates, we assessed bacterial burdens in several other organs. Colony-forming units of PAK were also increased in the spleen, liver, and kidneys, indicating that bacteria were able to spread from the original inoculation site (lungs) (Fig. 3, A–C). The spleen, which is the most sensitive indicator for bacterial spread, displayed a marked increase in bacterial burdens (Fig. 3A). Consistent with the PMN penetration into the serum (Fig. 2C), these results also suggest that the severe lung injury and bacterial spread into other organs are the possible cause of mortality in these mice. To confirm the dissemination results, we next determined MPO activity in the lung and other organs to again probe neutrophil penetration because MPO is a recognized influx for oxidation in tissue. As expected, similar MPO activity was observed in the lung, liver, and kidney (Fig. 3, D–F). Increased MPO in organs other than the lung (e.g. liver and kidney) suggests that the superoxide release may result from systemic spread of the invading PAK bacteria. As increased oxidation can also cause tissue injury by oxidative degradation of lipids, we used a thiobarbituric acid-reactive substance assay to detect lipid peroxidation in the lung, liver, and kidney tissue. Our results show that lipid peroxidation was significantly increased in all of the PAK-infected organs of cav1 KO mice as compared with WT mice (Fig. 3, G–I). The lung showed a marked increase in lipid peroxidation compared with the liver and kidney, suggesting that the lung was the main target. These data were consistent with the severity of lung injury determined using the MPO assay and superoxide detection, suggesting that the increased lipid peroxidation in KO mice is relevant to the progression of lung injury by oxidation. AM cells play a crucial role in bacterial clearance by phagocytosis (43Suntres Z.E. Omri A. Shek P.N. Microb. Pathog. 2002; 32: 27-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). To explore this relationship, we also measured the ingested PAK bacteria in AM cells.

The G protein RalA resides on Glut4 vesicles, and binds to the exocyst after activation by insulin, but must then disengage to ensure continuous exocytosis. Here we report that, after recognition of the exocyst by activated RalA, disengagement occurs through phosphorylation of its effector Sec5, rather than RalA inactivation. Sec5 undergoes phosphorylation in the G-protein binding domain, allosterically reducing RalA interaction. The phosphorylation event is catalysed by protein kinase C and is reversed by an exocyst-associated phosphatase. Introduction of Sec5 bearing mutations of the phosphorylation site to either alanine or aspartate disrupts insulin-stimulated Glut4 exocytosis, as well as other trafficking processes in polarized epithelial cells and during development of zebrafish embryos. The exocyst thus serves as a 'gatekeeper' for exocytic vesicles through a circuit of engagement, disengagement and re-engagement with G proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2066097230,"Biogenesis of the ribbon-like membrane network of the mammalian Golgi requires membrane tethering by the conserved GRASP domain in GRASP65 and GRASP55, yet the tethering mechanism is not fully understood. Here, we report the crystal structure of the GRASP55 GRASP domain, which revealed an unusual arrangement of two tandem PDZ folds that more closely resemble prokaryotic PDZ domains. Biochemical and functional data indicated that the interaction between the ligand-binding pocket of PDZ1 and an internal ligand on PDZ2 mediates the GRASP self-interaction, and structural analyses suggest that this occurs via a unique mode of internal PDZ ligand recognition. Our data uncover the structural basis for ligand specificity and provide insight into the mechanism of GRASP-dependent membrane tethering of analogous Golgi cisternae."
https://openalex.org/W2081693385,"To improve the low antimicrobial activity of LF11, an 11-mer peptide derived from human lactoferricin, mutant sequences were designed based on the defined structure of LF11 in the lipidic environment. Thus, deletion of noncharged polar residues and strengthening of the hydrophobic N-terminal part upon adding a bulky hydrophobic amino acid or N-acylation resulted in enhanced antimicrobial activity against Escherichia coli, which correlated with the peptides' degree of perturbation of bacterial membrane mimics. Nonacylated and N-acylated peptides exhibited different effects at a molecular level. Nonacylated peptides induced segregation of peptide-enriched and peptide-poor lipid domains in negatively charged bilayers, although N-acylated peptides formed small heterogeneous domains resulting in a higher degree of packing defects. Additionally, only N-acylated peptides perturbed the lateral packing of neutral lipids and exhibited increased permeability of E. coli lipid vesicles. The latter did not correlate with the extent of improvement of the antimicrobial activity, which could be explained by the fact that elevated binding of N-acylated peptides to lipopolysaccharides of the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria seems to counteract the elevated membrane permeabilization, reflected in the respective minimal inhibitory concentration for E. coli. The antimicrobial activity of the peptides correlated with an increase of membrane curvature stress and hence bilayer instability. Transmission electron microscopy revealed that only the N-acylated peptides induced tubular protrusions from the outer membrane, whereas all peptides caused detachment of the outer and inner membrane of E. coli bacteria. Viability tests demonstrated that these bacteria were dead before onset of visible cell lysis."
https://openalex.org/W2058490927,"Recently, both clinical and animal studies demonstrated neuronal and glial plasticity to be important for the therapeutic action of antidepressants. Antidepressants increase glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) production through monoamine-independent protein-tyrosine kinase, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), and cAMP responsive element-binding protein (CREB) activation in glial cells (Hisaoka, K., Takebayashi, M., Tsuchioka, M., Maeda, N., Nakata, Y., and Yamawaki, S. (2007) J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 321, 148-157; Hisaoka, K., Maeda, N., Tsuchioka, M., and Takebayashi, M. (2008) Brain Res. 1196, 53-58). This study clarifies the type of tyrosine kinase and mechanism of antidepressant-induced GDNF production in C6 glioma cells and normal human astrocytes. The amitriptyline (a tricyclic antidepressant)-induced ERK activation was specifically and completely inhibited by fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors and siRNA for FGFR1 and -2. Treatment with amitriptyline or several different classes of antidepressants, but not non-antidepressants, acutely increased the phosphorylation of FGFRs and FGFR substrate 2α (FRS2α). Amitriptyline-induced CREB phosphorylation and GDNF production were blocked by FGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Therefore, antidepressants activate the FGFR/FRS2α/ERK/CREB signaling cascade, thus resulting in GDNF production. Furthermore, we attempted to elucidate how antidepressants activate FGFR signaling. The effect of amitriptyline was inhibited by heparin, non-permeant FGF-2 neutralizing antibodies, and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) inhibitors. Serotonin (5-HT) also increased GDNF production through FGFR2 (Tsuchioka, M., Takebayashi, M., Hisaoka, K., Maeda, N., and Nakata, Y. (2008) J. Neurochem. 106, 244-257); however, the effect of 5-HT was not inhibited by heparin and MMP inhibitors. These results suggest that amitriptyline-induced FGFR activation might occur through an extracellular pathway, in contrast to that of 5-HT. The current data show that amitriptyline-induced FGFR activation might occur by the MMP-dependent shedding of FGFR ligands, such as FGF-2, thus resulting in GDNF production."
https://openalex.org/W2149683117,"We report here the structural determination of the N-linked glycans in the 66-kDa glycoprotein, part of the unique sulfated complex cell wall polysaccharide of the red microalga Porphyridium sp. Structures were elucidated by a combination of normal phase/reverse phase HPLC, positive ion MALDI-TOF MS, negative ion electrospray ionization, and MS/MS. The sugar moieties of the glycoprotein consisted of at least four fractions of N-linked glycans, each composed of the same four monosaccharides, GlcNAc, Man, 6-O-MeMan, and Xyl, with compositions Man(8-9)Xyl(1-2)Me(3)GlcNAc(2). The present study is the first report of N-glycans with the terminal Xyl attached to the 6-mannose branch of the 6-antenna and to the 3-oxygen of the penultimate (core) GlcNAc. Another novel finding was that all four glycans contain three O-methylmannose residues in positions that have never been reported before. Although it is known that some lower organisms are able to methylate terminal monosaccharides in glycans, the present study on Porphyridium sp. is the first describing an organism that is able to methylate non-terminal mannose residues. This study will thus contribute to understanding of N-glycosylation in algae and might shed light on the evolutionary development from prokaryotes to multicellular organisms. It also may contribute to our understanding of the red algae polysaccharide formation. The additional importance of this research lies in its potential for biotechnological applications, especially in evaluating the use of microalgae as cell factories for the production of therapeutic proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2088307815,"Somatic mutations of FLT3 involving internal tandem duplication (ITD) of the juxtamembrane domain or point mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain (TKD) appear to activate FLT3 in a FLT3 ligand (FL)-independent manner. To determine whether or not FLT3 mutants respond to FL for their activation, a FL-deficient (FL−/−) murine embryo fibroblast (MEF) cell line was established. Expression of FLT3/ITD and FLT3/TKD mutations in FL−/− MEF cells resulted in low levels of constitutive phosphorylation of FLT3. However, a more than fourfold increase of FLT3 autophosphorylation was induced by exogenous FL. Rescue of endogenous FL expression in FL−/− MEF cells expressing FLT3 mutants led to more than a threefold increase of FLT3 phosphorylation. FL addition led to further activation of the FLT3 receptors and enhanced survival and/or decreased apoptosis in leukemia-derived cell lines and primary leukemic cells expressing FLT3 mutations. Functional studies revealed that exogenous FL promoted the colony-forming and recloning abilities of FLT3 mutant transduced primary bone marrow cells derived from FL−/− mice. Endogenous FL contributes in vivo to functional signaling through FLT3 as noted by the decreased survival of FL+/+ITD+/+ mice compared with FL−/−ITD+/+ mice. These data suggest that FL leads to further activation of FLT3 mutants and is especially important in light of recent findings of elevated FL levels in acute myeloid leukemia patients in response to chemotherapy."
https://openalex.org/W2142723398,"Lysoplasmalogenase (EC 3.3.2.2 and EC 3.3.2.5) is an enzyme that catalyzes hydrolytic cleavage of the vinyl ether bond of lysoplasmalogen, forming fatty aldehyde and glycerophosphoethanolamine or glycerophosphocholine and is specific for the sn-2-deacylated form of plasmalogen. Here we report the purification, characterization, identification, and cloning of lysoplasmalogenase. Rat liver microsomal lysoplasmalogenase was solubilized with octyl glucoside and purified 500-fold to near homogeneity using four chromatography steps. The purified enzyme has apparent K(m) values of ∼50 μm for both lysoplasmenylcholine and lysoplasmenylethanolamine and apparent V(m) values of 24.5 and 17.5 μmol/min/mg protein for the two substrates, respectively. The pH optimum was 7.0. Lysoplasmalogenase was competitively inhibited by lysophosphatidic acid (K(i) ∼20 μm). The predominant band on a gel at ∼19 kDa was subjected to trypsinolysis, and the peptides were identified by mass spectrometry as Tmem86b, a protein of unknown function. Transient transfection of human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells showed that TMEM86b cDNA yielded lysoplasmalogenase activity, and Western blot analyses confirmed the synthesis of TMEM86b protein. The protein was localized in the membrane fractions. The TMEM86b gene was also transformed into Escherichia coli, and its expression was verified by Western blot and activity analyses. Tmem86b is a hydrophobic transmembrane protein of the YhhN family. Northern blot analyses demonstrated that liver expressed the highest level of Tmem86b, which agreed with tissue distribution of activity. Overexpression of TMEM86b in HEK 293T cells resulted in decreased levels of plasmalogens, suggesting that the enzyme may be important in regulating plasmalogen levels in animal cells."
https://openalex.org/W1968327904,"The present study investigated the interactions among the complement membrane attack complex (MAC), CCL2, and VEGF that occur in vivo during the development of choroidal neovascularization (CNV). We first investigated the sequential expression of MAC, CCL2, and VEGF during laser-induced CNV in C57BL/6 mice. Increased MAC deposition was detected at 1 h, CCL2 increased at 3 h, and VEGF was up-regulated at day 3 post-laser treatment. These results suggested that during laser-induced CNV, MAC, CCL2 and VEGF are formed and/or expressed in the following order: MAC → CCL2 → VEGF. To determine the cross-talk between MAC, CCL2, and VEGF during laser-induced CNV, neutralizing antibodies were injected both systemically and locally to block the bioactivity of each molecule. Blocking MAC formation inhibited CCL2 and VEGF expression and also limited CNV formation, whereas neutralization of CCL2 bioactivity did not affect MAC deposition; however, it reduced VEGF expression and CNV formation. When bioactivity of VEGF was blocked, CNV formation was significantly inhibited, but MAC deposition was not affected. Together, our results demonstrate that MAC is an upstream mediator and effect of MAC on the development of laser-induced CNV can be attributed to its direct effect on VEGF as well as its effect on VEGF that is mediated by CCL2. Understanding the interplay between immune mediators is critical to gain insight into the pathogenesis of CNV."

DC-specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3-grabbing non-integrin (DC-SIGN; CD209) is a type II transmembrane C-type lectin expressed on myeloid DCs in the dermis, mucosae, lymph nodes, and monocyte-derived DCs (MoDCs) (6Geijtenbeek T.B.

DC-SIGN binds to “self” glycan ligands found on human cells and to “foreign” glycans of bacterial or parasitic pathogens, and specifically recognizes glycoconjugates containing mannose (Man), fucose (Fuc), and nonsialylated Lewis (Le)a/Leb epitope structures in a Ca2+-dependent manner (8van Liempt E.

Through recognition of these glycans, DC-SIGN functions as an adhesion receptor and mediates the binding and internalization of foreign pathogens such as viruses (human immunodeficiency virus and hepatitis C virus), yeasts, bacteria (Mycobacterium tuberculosis), and parasites (3Geijtenbeek T.B. van Vliet S.J.

J. Immunol. 2008; 180: 3347-3356Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) found that DC-SIGN recognizes colorectal carcinoma cells through carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). DC-SIGN-binding CEA contained tumor-associated Le glycans, which were important for cellular interactions between DCs and colorectal carcinoma cells in situ. It is evident that the expression of CEA is limited and can be detected only in cancer and embryonic tissues. This glycoprotein is one of the most widely used tumor markers for gastrointestinal cancers such as colorectal carcinomas. However, its sensitivity and specificity are not high, particularly for early stages of the disease such as Dukes A or B stages. Based on our studies, we hypothesized that DC-SIGN may also be involved in the recognition of other glycoproteins, as novel potential biomarkers, expressed on colorectal cancers.In this study, we first identified Mac-2-binding protein (Mac-2BP) expressed on colorectal carcinoma cells as a novel DC-SIGN ligand through affinity chromatography and mass spectrometry. Mac-2BP, also known as 90K or galectin-3BP, is a secretory glycoprotein expressed on various normal epithelial cells and in human bodily fluids. It has been reported that the level of Mac-2BP increases in patients with pancreatic, breast, and lung cancer, virus infections such as acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and hepatitis C, and autoimmune diseases (11Grassadonia A. Tinari N. Iurisci I. Piccolo E. Cumashi A. Innominato P. D'Egidio M. Natoli C. Piantelli M. Iacobelli S. Glycoconj. J. 2004; 19: 551-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). However, most of the immunological significance of Mac-2BP on colorectal carcinomas remains unknown.In addition, we found that DC-SIGN-dependent cellular interactions between immature MoDCs and colorectal carcinoma cells mainly expressing Mac-2BP were able to significantly inhibit LPS-induced MoDC functional maturation. Furthermore, we also detected Mac-2BP as a predominant DC-SIGN ligand expressed on some primary colorectal cancer tissues from certain parts of patients in comparison with CEA from the other parts. Therefore, we suggest that Mac-2BP carrying fucosylated glycans may become a novel potential colorectal cancer biomarker for some CEA-low or -negative colorectal cancer patients, and the novel function of DC-SIGN may, at least in part, underlie for its potential use as a novel diagnostic sensor for some colorectal cancer patients through recognition of CEA and Mac-2BP.DISCUSSIONDuring the neoplastic process in colon tissues, genetic or epigenetic gene alteration often accompanies changes in cell-surface glycans. Glycosylation changes during malignant transformation lead to tumor-specific carbohydrate structures that interact with C-type lectins on dendritic cells. In general, these changes have been associated with a poor prognosis, as they are linked to the aggressiveness and metastatic capacity of tumors. Good examples of heavily glycosylated tumor antigens are CEA and CEACAM1 (13Midiri G. Amanti C. Benedetti M. Campisi C. Santeusanio G. Castagna G. Peronace L. Di Tondo U. Di Paola M. Pascal R.R.

Because the function of dendritic cells may be dependent on their binding properties as to self-antigens and pathogens, it is essential to obtain a detailed insight into the carbohydrate-binding properties of DC-SIGN.Previous research indicated that tumor cells with their surface decorated with β1-6-branched N-linked oligosaccharides acquire invasiveness and metastatic potential through a change in the affinity level to the extracellular microenvironment (20Seelentag W.K. Li W.P. Schmitz S.F. Metzger U. Aeberhard P. Heitz P.U. Roth J. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 5559-5564PubMed Google Scholar, 21Dennis J.W. Laferté S. Waghorne C. Breitman M.L. Kerbel R.S. Science. 1987; 236: 582-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar). Mac-2BP expressed on colorectal carcinoma cells was initially identified as a l-PHA-recognized major glycoprotein bearing polylactosamine glycans extending from β1-6 branched N-linked oligosaccharides (22Laferté S. Loh L.C. Biochem. J. 1992; 283: 193-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 23Fernandes B. Sagman U. Auger M. Demetrio M. Dennis J.W. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 718-723PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we have firstly identified Mac-2BP on colorectal carcinoma cells as a novel ligand for C-type lectin DC-SIGN and demonstrated the Ca2+-dependent interaction of rhDC-SIGN with Mac-2BP from colorectal carcinoma COLO205 cells. Generally, DC-SIGN exhibits dual specificities for high-mannose as well as Le-type glycans (8van Liempt E. Bank C.M. Mehta P. Garciá-Vallejo J.J. Kawar Z.S. Geyer R. Alvarez R.A. Cummings R.D.

Biol. 2004; 11: 591-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). Foreign antigens recognized by DC-SIGN have both types of glycans. Whereas, so far, most endogenous ligands for DC-SIGN have been found to carry only Le-type glycans. Here we showed that specific removal of Le glycans on Mac-2BP by α1-3,4-fucosidase abrogated these interactions, indicating that the fucose moieties of Le glycans are required for the interactions. We also observed that DC-SIGN ligands are highly expressed with Le glycans on human colorectal carcinoma cells, suggesting that increased expression of DC-SIGN ligands on colorectal cancer cells in addition to altered glycosylation results in recognition by DC-SIGN and that further fucosylation of polylactosamine glycans and formation of Le epitopes on Mac-2BP during cancer progression may be important for induction of the interaction between DC-SIGN and Mac-2BP. In addition, we also found that the expression levels of Le epitopes were positively correlated with the staining levels with rhDC-SIGN in 30 colorectal carcinoma cell lines, including LoVo, LS513, LS174T, SNU1197, etc. (data not shown).CEA is one of the most widely used tumor markers for gastrointestinal cancer such as colorectal carcinomas. It has been pointed out that the change in distribution of CEA from apical into basolateral and stromal areas in malignant colorectal cancer tissues could be a cause of its entry into the blood and elevation of the serum CEA levels (14Hamada Y. Yamamura M. Hioki K. Yamamoto M. Nagura H. Watanabe K. Cancer. 1985; 55: 136-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 16Ahnen D.J. Nakane P.K. Brown W.R. Cancer. 1982; 49: 2077-2090Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). However, the sensitivity and specificity of CEA are considered to be low, particularly for early stages of the disease such as Dukes A or B stages (26Duffy M.J. Clin. Chem. 2001; 47: 624-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). We showed here that the distribution of Mac-2BP was more basolateral than that of CEA and that expression of Mac-2BP in primary colon adenocarcinoma tissues was increased compared with in proximal normal tissues and obtained various staining patterns for Mac-2BP such as luminal staining and punctate staining on the apical and basolateral faces (Fig. 7B). In addition, we observed here that DC-SIGN greatly associated with not only CEA but also Mac-2BP on the apical face of cancer epithelia and that DC-SIGN retained responsiveness to Mac-2BP in more basolateral areas. Because basolateral expression of Mac-2BP has been reported to be more prevalent in early stage Dukes A tumors than in advanced ones (12Ulmer T.A. Keeler V. Loh L. Chibbar R. Torlakovic E. André S. Gabius H.J. Laferté S. J. Cell Biochem. 2006; 98: 1351-1366Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), DC-SIGN may preferably recognize early stage colorectal carcinoma cells through Mac-2BP. Therefore, similarly to that of CEA, aberrant expression of Mac-2BP and its polar breakdown in cancer tissues may allow its entry into blood vessels. Furthermore, it is also interesting that the type of Mac-2BP secreted by several colorectal carcinoma cells had DC-SIGN-detectable glycan structures, whereas we did not detect any binding of DC-SIGN to serum Mac-2BP from healthy donors (data not shown), suggesting that DC-SIGN can qualitatively distinguish colorectal carcinoma-derived Mac-2BP from serum Mac-2BP in normal and cancer patients.Recent evidence indicates that dendritic cell-associated DC-SIGN may have functions in both the induction of tolerance to self-antigens and the recognition of pathogens, respectively. A variety of cytokines, including IL-6, IL-10, and macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF), have been shown to affect the maturation of DCs from CD34+ precursors and from MoDCs in vitro (27Menetrier-Caux C.

It is now evident that inadequate functioning of the host immune system is one of the main mechanisms by which tumors escape from immune control, as well as an important factor that limits the success of cancer immunotherapy. In recent years, it has become increasingly clear that defects in DCs play a crucial role in non-responsiveness to tumors (29Gabrilovich D. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2004; 4: 941-952Crossref PubMed Scopus (848) Google Scholar). Here, we showed that DC-SIGN-dependent cellular interactions between immature MoDCs and colorectal carcinoma cells significantly inhibited MoDC functional maturation, suggesting that, similar to CEA, Mac-2BP bearing colorectal tumor-associated Le glycans may provide a tolerogenic microenvironment for colorectal carcinoma cells through interactions with DC-SIGN. These findings also imply that the glycosylation-dependent cellular interactions may result in suppression of DC functions, possibly through immunosuppressive cytokines such as IL-6 and IL-10, and that production of these immunosuppressive factors in DC tumor coculture supernatants may be one of the mechanisms by which tumors evade immunosurveillance.Recently, the intracellular signaling mechanisms of DC-SIGN were elucidated (30Gringhuis S.I. den Dunnen J.

Immunol. 2009; 10: 1081-1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). DC-SIGN constitutively associates with a signalosome complex consisting of scaffold protein LSP1 and mediates cross-talk with Toll-like receptor signaling, which results in modulation of Toll-like receptor-induced cytokine responses. Indeed, interaction of foreign pathogens such as M. tuberculosis leads to up-regulation of LPS-induced IL-10 and suppresses MoDC maturation (33Geijtenbeek T.B. Van Vliet S.J. Koppel E.A. Sanchez-Hernandez M. Vandenbroucke-Grauls C.M. Appelmelk B. Van Kooyk Y. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 197: 7-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar). Therefore, the MoDC maturation as a consequence of DC-SIGN interacting with Le glycans of cancer cells may also be mediated through a series of LSP1-associated intracellular signaling pathway. MoDCs, following sensitization with CEA-derived peptides ex vivo, are now utilized as a tool for the clinical applications of tumor immunotherapies. As the immunogenicities of peptide vaccines vary among patients who exhibit different immune responsiveness, which is defined by means of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) types, etc., appropriate selection of antigens is needed individually to obtain adequate therapeutic benefit. In this context, colorectal carcinoma-derived Mac-2BP, similar to CEA, might become a candidate new cancer vaccine. Canceling of tumor-escaping mechanisms, such as DC-SIGN-mediated MoDC dysfunction, by combination of therapeutic agents that target intracellular signaling molecules (e.g. LSP1) may be a critical step for maintaining the effective tumor-immunogenicity in the future.In conclusion, based on the distinct expression patterns of Mac-2BP and CEA together with the DC-SIGN recognition model presented here, colorectal cancer patients could be divided into Mac-2BPhigh/CEAhigh, Mac-2BPlow/CEAhigh, Mac-2BPhigh/CEAlow, and Mac-2BPlow/CEAlow groups. The establishment of a model of the DC-SIGN-Mac-2BP/CEA interaction is a valuable step toward elucidation of the physiological function and molecular mechanism and provides a knowledge-based approach for the clinical applications of cancer immunotherapies and novel diagnoses. For this purpose, identification of the DC-SIGN-Mac-2BP/CEA model that breaks immunotolerance to Mac-2BP/CEA and induces cancer immunosurveillance failure both in vitro and in vivo is therefore a major goal for therapeutic applications in the future.

For effective recognition of antigens, DCs exploit a wide range of pattern recognition receptors such as Toll-like receptors and C-type lectins (3Geijtenbeek T.B. van Vliet S.J.

DC-specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3-grabbing non-integrin (DC-SIGN; CD209) is a type II transmembrane C-type lectin expressed on myeloid DCs in the dermis, mucosae, lymph nodes, and monocyte-derived DCs (MoDCs) (6Geijtenbeek T.B.

DC-SIGN binds to “self” glycan ligands found on human cells and to “foreign” glycans of bacterial or parasitic pathogens, and specifically recognizes glycoconjugates containing mannose (Man), fucose (Fuc), and nonsialylated Lewis (Le)a/Leb epitope structures in a Ca2+-dependent manner (8van Liempt E. Bank C.M. Mehta P. Garciá-Vallejo J.J. Kawar Z.S. Geyer R. Alvarez R.A. Cummings R.D. Kooyk Y. van Die I. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 6123-6131Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Through recognition of these glycans, DC-SIGN functions as an adhesion receptor and mediates the binding and internalization of foreign pathogens such as viruses (human immunodeficiency virus and hepatitis C virus), yeasts, bacteria (Mycobacterium tuberculosis), and parasites (3Geijtenbeek T.B. van Vliet S.J. Engering A. ‘t Hart B.A. van Kooyk Y. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2004; 22: 33-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar).Recently, we and another group (9van Gisbergen K.P. Aarnoudse C.A. Meijer G.A.

J. Immunol. 2008; 180: 3347-3356Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) found that DC-SIGN recognizes colorectal carcinoma cells through carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). DC-SIGN-binding CEA contained tumor-associated Le glycans, which were important for cellular interactions between DCs and colorectal carcinoma cells in situ. It is evident that the expression of CEA is limited and can be detected only in cancer and embryonic tissues. This glycoprotein is one of the most widely used tumor markers for gastrointestinal cancers such as colorectal carcinomas. However, its sensitivity and specificity are not high, particularly for early stages of the disease such as Dukes A or B stages. Based on our studies, we hypothesized that DC-SIGN may also be involved in the recognition of other glycoproteins, as novel potential biomarkers, expressed on colorectal cancers.In this study, we first identified Mac-2-binding protein (Mac-2BP) expressed on colorectal carcinoma cells as a novel DC-SIGN ligand through affinity chromatography and mass spectrometry. Mac-2BP, also known as 90K or galectin-3BP, is a secretory glycoprotein expressed on various normal epithelial cells and in human bodily fluids. It has been reported that the level of Mac-2BP increases in patients with pancreatic, breast, and lung cancer, virus infections such as acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and hepatitis C, and autoimmune diseases (11Grassadonia A. Tinari N. Iurisci I. Piccolo E. Cumashi A. Innominato P. D'Egidio M. Natoli C. Piantelli M. Iacobelli S. Glycoconj. J. 2004; 19: 551-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). However, most of the immunological significance of Mac-2BP on colorectal carcinomas remains unknown.In addition, we found that DC-SIGN-dependent cellular interactions between immature MoDCs and colorectal carcinoma cells mainly expressing Mac-2BP were able to significantly inhibit LPS-induced MoDC functional maturation. Furthermore, we also detected Mac-2BP as a predominant DC-SIGN ligand expressed on some primary colorectal cancer tissues from certain parts of patients in comparison with CEA from the other parts. Therefore, we suggest that Mac-2BP carrying fucosylated glycans may become a novel potential colorectal cancer biomarker for some CEA-low or -negative colorectal cancer patients, and the novel function of DC-SIGN may, at least in part, underlie for its potential use as a novel diagnostic sensor for some colorectal cancer patients through recognition of CEA and Mac-2BP."

Other chymotrypsins and elastases are inactive on the regulatory sites cleaved by CTRC, suggesting that CTRC recognizes unique sequence patterns. To characterize the molecular determinants underlying CTRC specificity, we selected high affinity substrate-like small protein inhibitors against CTRC from a phage library displaying variants of SGPI-2, a natural chymotrypsin inhibitor from Schistocerca gregaria. On the basis of the sequence pattern selected, we designed eight inhibitor variants in which amino acid residues in the reactive loop at P1 (Met or Leu), P2' (Leu or Asp), and P4' (Glu, Asp, or Ala) were varied. Binding experiments with CTRC revealed that (i) inhibitors with Leu at P1 bind 10-fold stronger than those with P1 Met; (ii) Asp at P2' (versus Leu) decreases affinity but increases selectivity, and (iii) Glu or Asp at P4' (versus Ala) increase affinity 10-fold. The highest affinity SGPI-2 variant (K(D) 20 pm) bound to CTRC 575-fold tighter than the parent molecule. The most selective inhibitor variant exhibited a K(D) of 110 pm and a selectivity ranging from 225- to 112,664-fold against other human chymotrypsins and elastases. Homology modeling and mutagenesis identified a cluster of basic amino acid residues (Lys(51), Arg(56), and Arg(80)) on the surface of human CTRC that interact with the P4' acidic residue of the inhibitor. The acidic preference of CTRC at P4' is unique among pancreatic proteases and might contribute to the high specificity of CTRC-mediated digestive enzyme regulation."
https://openalex.org/W2026727437,"Sarco/endoplasmic reticulum (SR/ER) Ca(2+)-ATPase (SERCA) is an intracellular Ca(2+) pump localized on the SR/ER membrane. The role of SERCA in refilling intracellular Ca(2+) stores is pivotal for maintaining intracellular Ca(2+) homeostasis, and disturbed SERCA activity causes many disease phenotypes, including heart failure, diabetes, cancer, and Alzheimer disease. Although SERCA activity has been described using a simple enzyme activity equation, the dynamics of SERCA activity in living cells is still unknown. To monitor SERCA activity in living cells, we constructed an enhanced CFP (ECFP)- and FlAsH-tagged SERCA2a, designated F-L577, which retains the ATP-dependent Ca(2+) pump activity. The FRET efficiency between ECFP and FlAsH of F-L577 is dependent on the conformational state of the molecule. ER luminal Ca(2+) imaging confirmed that the FRET signal changes directly reflect the Ca(2+) pump activity. Dual imaging of cytosolic Ca(2+) and the FRET signals of F-L577 in intact COS7 cells revealed that SERCA2a activity is coincident with the oscillatory cytosolic Ca(2+) concentration changes evoked by ATP stimulation. The Ca(2+) pump activity of SERCA2a in intact cells can be expressed by the Hill equation with an apparent affinity for Ca(2+) of 0.41 ± 0.0095 μm and a Hill coefficient of 5.7 ± 0.73. These results indicate that in the cellular environment the Ca(2+) dependence of ATPase activation is highly cooperative and that SERCA2a acts as a rapid switch to refill Ca(2+) stores in living cells for shaping the intracellular Ca(2+) dynamics. F-L577 will be useful for future studies on Ca(2+) signaling involving SERCA2a activity."
https://openalex.org/W2165508998,"VEGF-D is a mitogen for endothelial cells that promotes tumor growth and metastatic spread in animal models, and expression of which correlates with lymph node metastasis in some human cancers. It is secreted from the cell as a full-length form with propeptides flanking a central region containing binding sites for VEGFR-2 and VEGFR-3, receptors that signal for angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis. The propeptides can be cleaved from VEGF-D, enhancing affinity for VEGFR-2 and VEGFR-3 in vitro; however, the importance of this processing in cancer is unclear. To explore the necessity of processing for the effects of VEGF-D in cancer, we use a mutant full-length form that cannot be processed, and show that, in contrast to full-length VEGF-D that is processed, this mutant does not promote tumor growth and lymph node metastasis in a mouse tumor model. Processing of VEGF-D is required for tumor angiogenesis, lymphangiogenesis, and recruitment of tumor-associated macrophages. These observations may be explained by the requirement of processing for VEGF-D to bind neuropilin receptors and activate VEGFR-2. Our results indicate that proteolytic processing is necessary for VEGF-D to promote the growth and spread of cancer, and suggest that enzymes catalyzing this processing could be targets for antimetastatic therapeutics.—Harris, N.

https://openalex.org/W1995012876,"Methylmalonate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase (MSDH) belongs to the CoA-dependent aldehyde dehydrogenase subfamily. It catalyzes the NAD-dependent oxidation of methylmalonate semialdehyde (MMSA) to propionyl-CoA via the acylation and deacylation steps. MSDH is the only member of the aldehyde dehydrogenase superfamily that catalyzes a β-decarboxylation process in the deacylation step. Recently, we demonstrated that the β-decarboxylation is rate-limiting and occurs before CoA attack on the thiopropionyl enzyme intermediate. Thus, this prevented determination of the transthioesterification kinetic parameters. Here, we have addressed two key aspects of the mechanism as follows: 1) the molecular basis for recognition of the carboxylate of MMSA; and 2) how CoA binding modulates its reactivity. We substituted two invariant arginines, Arg-124 and Arg-301, by Leu. The second-order rate constant for the acylation step for both mutants was decreased by at least 50-fold, indicating that both arginines are essential for efficient MMSA binding through interactions with the carboxylate group. To gain insight into the transthioesterification, we substituted MMSA with propionaldehyde, as both substrates lead to the same thiopropionyl enzyme intermediate. This allowed us to show the following: 1) the pK(app) of CoA decreases by ∼3 units upon binding to MSDH in the deacylation step; and 2) the catalytic efficiency of the transthioesterification is increased by at least 10(4)-fold relative to a chemical model. Moreover, we observed binding of CoA to the acylation complex, supporting a CoA-binding site distinct from that of NAD(H)."

The main source of IFNβ RNA was the spermatid population. Importantly, the Tg10 mice, but not the double mutant Tg10-Ifnar1−/−, showed altered spermatogenesis. The first IFNAR-dependent histological alteration was a higher apoptosis index in all germ cell categories apart from non-dividing spermatogonia.

Several known interferon-stimulated genes were up-regulated in Tg10 Sertoli cells and prepachytene germ cells but not in pachytene spermatocytes and spermatids. In concordance with this, pachytene spermatocytes and spermatids isolated from wild-type testes did not display measurable amounts of IFNAR1 and phosphorylated STAT1 upon IFNβ challenge in vitro, suggesting hyporesponsiveness of these cell types to IFN. At day 60, Tg10 males were sterile, and Sertoli cells showed increased amounts of anti-Mullerian hormone and decreased production of inhibin B, both probably attributable to the massive germ cell loss.

The overexpression of GTPBP1 accelerated the target mRNA decay, whereas the reduction of the GTPBP1 expression with RNA interference stabilized the target mRNA. GTPBP1 has a putative guanosinetriphosphate (GTP)-binding domain, which is found in members of the G-protein family and Ski7p, a well-known core factor of the exosome-mediated mRNA turnover pathway in yeast.

Liquid rich medium containing acetate consisted of 1% (w/v) yeast extract, 2% (w/v) Bacto-peptone, and 2% (w/v) sodium acetate (YPA medium). 2% (w/v) Bacto-agar was added for plates. For the SICD experiments, cells were incubated in 2% glucose/water (referred to hereafter as “glucose/water”). The water for all experiments was purified by a Milli-Q reagent system (Millipore) and sterilized by autoclave, and the pH was 5.8. 2,5-Anhydro-d-mannitol (2,5-AM) was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The SICD assay was performed as described (13Granot D. Snyder M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1991; 88: 5724-5728Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Strains were pre-grown in 4 ml of YPD medium in glass tubes with shaking for 2 days at 30 °C to a density of 2–6 × 108 cells/ml. Cells were washed and resuspended in 2 ml of water, and aliquots were transferred to 3 ml of water, glucose/water, or glucose/water with various reagents to yield 2.0 × 107 cells/ml (15Granot D. Levine A. Dor-Hefetz E. FEMS Yeast Res. 2003; 4: 7-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). For every sample, the initial pH was adjusted to pH 5.8, and cultures were incubated with shaking at 37 °C. For the viability assay, aliquots were taken at the indicated times, diluted, and plated on YPD plates. The plates were incubated for 3 days at 30 °C, and then colony-forming units (cfu) were counted. The cfu value at the end of day 2 is the zero time point and represents 100% survival. A survival curve is the percent of viable cells versus time. For the growth assay, cells were pre-grown in YPD medium for 2 days at 30 °C and then washed and resuspended in water to a concentration of 1.0 × 108 cells/ml. Cells were serially diluted in 10-fold steps, and 5 μl of each dilution was spotted onto the indicated plates. Plates were incubated for several days at 30 °C. A BioTek Synergy 4 multi-detection microplate reader was used to measure ROS accumulation. At the indicated times, the dye 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA) was added to each sample of cells to yield a final concentration of 5 μg/ml, and the samples were then incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Samples were washed and resuspended to the original volume in water and then aliquoted into the individual wells of the plate. The excitation and emission wavelengths were 485 and 535 nm, respectively. The absorbance of each well was also measured at 560 nm. The “ROS signal” is S = F535 nm/A560 nm. Experiments were conducted in three independent experiments, each in triplicate. Oxygen consumption was monitored using a YSI Model 5300 biological oxygen monitor equipped with a Clark-type oxygen electrode (YSI Inc.). The samples were prepared as described above. Briefly, cells were pre-grown in YPD medium for 2 days, washed and resuspended in the indicated media, and incubated at 37 °C. Before determining the rate of oxygen consumption, the absorbance (A600 nm) of each sample was measured. Samples (5 ml) were then transferred to an airtight chamber maintained at 37 °C, and the oxygen content was monitored for at least 5 min. To ensure that the oxygen consumption was due to mitochondrial activity, sodium azide was routinely added to the cultures (final concentration, 0.05% (w/v)), and the rates with and without azide were compared. Each experiment was repeated three times. Cells were pre-grown in YPD medium for 2 days and then washed and resuspended in various media to a final concentration of 2.0 × 107 cells/ml. Cells were incubated with shaking for 3–6 h at 37 °C. The cultures were centrifuged at 7000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, and the pellet was resuspended in 0.6 ml of water. 100 μl of 35% (v/v) perchloric acid was added per sample, and the samples were incubated on ice for 1 h. Samples were neutralized with 145 μl of 2 m K2CO3. The ATP content of the cells was measured using an ATP bioluminescence assay kit (Sigma), which is based on the luciferin-luciferase reaction (18Lemasters J.J. Hackenbrock C.R. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 56: 530-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Glucose 6-phosphate, fructose 6-phosphate, and fructose 1,6-bisphosphate were determined using NAD(P)H-coupled enzymatic reactions according to Bergmeyer (19Bergmeyer H.U. Methods of Enzymatic Analysis. 2nd Ed. Academic Press, New York1974Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by the Lowry method (20Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). p values were determined using unpaired, two-tailed Student's t tests. The mean survival time (t½) is when 50% of the cells were dead. The SICD experiments described herein were performed in pre-grown cells (see “Experimental Procedures”) that were transferred to and incubated in glucose/water or water at 37 °C, the temperature at which the SICD phenotype is strongest (13Granot D. Snyder M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1991; 88: 5724-5728Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 14Granot D. Snyder M. Yeast. 1993; 9: 465-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). To illuminate the biochemical pathway that controls SICD in S. cerevisiae, we initially screened the Prestwick Chemical Library for drugs that block this mode of cell death and discovered that antimycin A, which inhibits mitochondrial respiratory enzyme complex III, partially inhibits SICD. This finding led us to discover even more potent inhibitors. Antimycin A partially protects stationary-phase cells (BY4741 and W303-1a) in glucose/water from SICD (Fig. 1A). The mean survival time (t½) increased from, on average, 0.3 days (without antimycin A) to 1.6 days (with antimycin A) for each WT strain. Respiratory-deficient rho0 cells, generated by treatment with EtBr, were also partially resistant to SICD (Fig. 1B). Note that antimycin A and EtBr were toxic to starved cells (water) (Fig. 1C). Specifically, the t½ values of stationary-phase cells in water and water/antimycin A were 12.2 ± 0.8 and 3.2 ± 0.5 days, respectively. This latter value is similar to the t½ for rho0 cells in water. The effect of antimycin A and EtBr on ROS accumulation in stationary-phase cells was also examined (Fig. 1D). These compounds decreased ROS accumulation by 57% (12 h) for cells in glucose/water. In contrast, these compounds increased ROS accumulation by 489% (12 h) for cells in water. Ascorbic acid, an antioxidant, increased the survival time of WT cells in glucose/water by 568% (Fig. 1E), indicating that ROS accumulation contributes to cell death. The results show that small molecule inhibitors of respiration partially protect cells from SICD (cells in glucose/water) but are toxic to starved cells (cells in water). The Krebs and glyoxylate cycles share intermediates and are coordinately regulated; deletion mutants of each cycle cannot use acetate as a sole carbon source (21Liao X. Butow R.A. Cell. 1993; 72: 61-71Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar, 22McCammon M.T. Genetics. 1996; 144: 57-69Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and often have growth defects on non-fermentable substrates (23Steinmetz L.M. Scharfe C. Deutschbauer A.M. Mokranjac D. Herman Z.S. Jones T. Chu A.M. Giaever G. Prokisch H. Oefner P.J. Davis R.W. Nat. Genet. 2002; 31: 400-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that such mutants would protect cells from SICD. To test this hypothesis, three Krebs cycle mutants (sdh1Δ, sdh2Δ, and fum1Δ) and one glyoxylate cycle mutant (icl1Δ) were evaluated. Stationary-phase mutants in glucose/water had dramatically reduced O2 consumption compared with WT cells (Table 1), and it was verified that the mutants fail to grow on acetate (Fig. 2A).TABLE 1O2 consumption of cells incubated under various conditionsConditionO2 consumptionO2 %/min/AYPD medium (6 h)WT0.04 ± 0.02Stationary-phase cells in water (6 h)WT0.26 ± 0.03+Sodium azide0.04 ± 0.02+Succinate (10 mm)0.11 ± 0.03+Phosphate (1 mm)0.24 ± 0.02+Phosphate (10 mm)0.25 ± 0.04rho00.01 ± 0.01sdh1Δ0.03 ± 0.01sdh2Δ0.03 ± 0.01fum1Δ0.02 ± 0.01icl1Δ0.05 ± 0.02Stationary-phase cells in glucose/water (6 h)WT0.84 ± 0.08aFrom a cfu assay, we estimated that, at 6 h of incubation, 20% of the cells were dead in this experiment.

Open table in a new tab The four mutants clearly protected against SICD, as evidenced by a 7–13.7-fold increase in survival compared with WT cells (Fig. 2B). Although these mutants displayed increased fitness against SICD, they displayed decreased fitness against starvation (water) (Fig. 2C), i.e. the survival time for WT cells of 11.6 ± 1.2 days decreased to 4.0–4.7 days for the mutants. ROS accumulation was measured at various times after shifting stationary-phase cells into glucose/water or water and incubating at 37 °C. In glucose/water, ROS accumulation was, on average, 62% (12 h) less in the Krebs and glyoxylate cycle mutants than in WT cells (Fig. 2D). In contrast, in water, ROS levels increased by 310% (12 h) in the mutants compared with WT cells. Similar ROS levels occurred in these mutants grown in glucose/water versus water. Because of down-regulated respiration, Krebs and glyoxylate cycle deletion mutants protect cells from SICD to the same extent as or even better than small molecule inhibitors of respiration. We hypothesized that stationary-phase yeast cells in glucose/water fail to down-regulate O2 consumption. To test this hypothesis, a Clark-type electrode was used to measure O2 consumption under a variety of conditions. For stationary-phase cells transferred into glucose/water and incubated for 6 h at 37 °C, the O2 consumption rate was 21-fold faster than for exponential-phase cells in YPD medium and 3.2-fold faster than for stationary-phase cells in water (Table 1). Such results indicate that glucose in the absence of other nutrients fails to inhibit respiration. Because succinate accumulates in the succinate dehydrogenase mutant sdh2Δ (24Smith E.H. Janknecht R. Maher 3rd, L.J. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2007; 16: 3136-3148Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), we questioned whether succinate, independent of the deletion of SDH2, can rescue cells from SICD. Wild-type cells were pre-grown to stationary phase and then transferred to and incubated in glucose/water or water with 10 mm succinate (or acetate or glycerol). For cells in glucose/water, succinate and acetate were prosurvival, increasing survival by 10- and 3.3-fold, respectively, whereas glycerol had no effect compared with cells without additives (Fig. 3A). For cells in water, succinate and acetate decreased survival by 73 and 44%, respectively, whereas glycerol had no effect (Fig. 3B). Succinate and acetate, but not glycerol, decreased ROS accumulation in stationary-phase cells in glucose/water but increased ROS accumulation in stationary-phase cells in water (Fig. 3C). Succinate also decreased the rate of O2 consumption of stationary-phase cells in glucose/water and water (Table 1). The combined results show that succinate (and to a lesser extent, acetate) protects cells from SICD and is toxic to starved cells. Phosphate has been suggested to regulate the Crabtree effect (11Koobs D.H. Science. 1972; 178: 127-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 12Sussman I. Erecińska M. Wilson D.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 591: 209-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Phosphate (1 mm) increased the survival of stationary-phase cells in glucose/water by 16.7-fold compared with cells without phosphate (Fig. 4A) but had no effect on cells in water (Fig. 4B). Phosphate also decreased ROS accumulation and O2 consumption of stationary-phase cells in glucose/water. Specifically, phosphate (but not NaSO4) decreased ROS accumulation by 88% at 12 h compared with control cells without phosphate (Fig. 4C), and 1 and 10 mm phosphate decreased the rate of O2 consumption by 66 and 83% (Table 1), respectively. Overall, phosphate exhibits a powerful protective effect against SICD but has no effect on starved cells. Recent work indicates that the glycolytic intermediate Fru-1,6-P2 regulates the Crabtree effect (6Díaz-Ruiz R. Avéret N. Araiza D. Pinson B. Uribe-Carvajal S. Devin A. Rigoulet M. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 26948-26955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Fru-1,6-P2 is synthesized by phosphofructokinase, which is allosterically activated by phosphate (25Bañuelos M. Gancedo C. Gancedo J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 6394-6398Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Late-stage stationary-phase cells can have a suboptimal concentration of cytosolic phosphate (26Katchman B.J. Fetty W.O. J. Bacteriol. 1955; 69: 607-615Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Werner T.P. Amrhein N. Freimoser F.M. Arch. Microbiol. 2005; 184: 129-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), even before transfer into glucose/water, and we suggest that this deficit decreases the activity of phosphofructokinase. We tested whether added Fru-1,6-P2 protects cells from SICD and whether added phosphate triggers the synthesis of Fru-1,6-P2. Fru-1,6-P2 has been reported to enter myocytes and large unilamellar vesicles (28Hardin C.D. Lazzarino G. Tavazzi B. Di Pierro D. Roberts T.M. Giardina B. Rovetto M.J. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2001; 281: H2654-H2660Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Ehringer W.D. Su S. Chiang B. Stillwell W. Chien S. Lipids. 2002; 37: 885-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), although the mechanism is controversial. Instead of using Fru-1,6-P2, we used the cell-permeable analog 2,5-AM, which enters cells and is phosphorylated to yield 2,5-AM-ol bisphosphate (30Riquelme P.T. Wernette-Hammond M.E. Kneer N.M. Lardy H.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1983; 80: 4301-4305Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), which accumulates in the cytosol because it is not metabolized. 2,5-AM increased the survival (5.5-fold) of stationary-phase cells in glucose/water and inhibited ROS accumulation and O2 consumption (Fig. 5, A–C). This Fru-1,6-P2 analog partially protects cells from SICD. The effect of phosphate, succinate, and 2,5-AM on the level of glycolytic intermediates (Fru-1,6-P2, Glc-6-P, and Fru-6-P) and ATP in stationary-phase cells in glucose/water was determined (Table 2). The phosphate concentration was 1 mm, and the 2,5-AM and succinate concentrations were both 10 mm. After 3 h, phosphate increased the concentrations of Fru-1,6-P2 (2.6-fold) and Fru-6-P (1.9-fold) but had no effect on Glc-6-P relative to cells without phosphate in glucose/water; phosphate also decreased ATP by 47%. 2,5-AM increased Fru-1,6-P2 (1.6-fold) and decreased ATP, but not as much as phosphate. In contrast, succinate had no effect on the three glycolytic intermediates, but it decreased ATP by 76% compared with cells without succinate in glucose/water. The results show that (i) phosphate, but not succinate, triggers the synthesis of Fru-1,6-P2; and (ii) phosphate and succinate each inhibit ATP synthesis, but only phosphate alters the levels of the glycolytic intermediates.TABLE 2Analysis of intracellular metabolites in stationary-phase cellsIntracellular metabolitesaIntracellular levels of metabolites (nanomoles/mg of protein) were analyzed by the enzymatic assay method carried out in triplicate.AdditivesGlucose/water+Phosphate (1 mm)+2,5-AM (10 mm)+Succinate (10 mm)ATP (3 h)bIncubation times at 37 °C with the indicated additives.6.6 ± 0.83.5 ± 1.43.8 ± 1.11.6 ± 0.3Glc-6-P (3 h)21 ± 2.223.3 ± 2.118.4 ± 1.521.3 ± 3.1Fru-6-P (3 h)5.4 ± 0.810.3 ± 1.64.6 ± 1.26.7 ± 0.4Fru-1,6-P2 (3 h)5.5 ± 1.314.5 ± 0.98.8 ± 0.86.6 ± 0.5Fru-1,6-P2 (6 h)5.8 ± 1.118.2 ± 0.711 ± 1.57.2 ± 0.8a Intracellular levels of metabolites (nanomoles/mg of protein) were analyzed by the enzymatic assay method carried out in triplicate.b Incubation times at 37 °C with the indicated additives. Open table in a new tab S. cerevisiae cells have five phosphate transporters. Pho84 is the high affinity transporter, and this “transceptor” also mediates phosphate signaling. Phosphate signaling through Pho84 requires phosphate binding, not transport (31Giots F. Donaton M.C. Thevelein J.M. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 47: 1163-1181Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 32Popova Y. Thayumanavan P. Lonati E. Agrochão M. Thevelein J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 2890-2895Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), and results in activation of the protein kinase A pathway, which in turn up-regulates the activity of various glycolytic enzymes. Phosphate signaling is abolished in pho84Δ cells. We tested whether phosphate would protect stationary-phase pho84Δ cells from SICD. Cells with added phosphate had increased Fru-1,6-P2 levels (4.7-fold) and increased survival (15-fold) compared with the same cells without phosphate (Fig. 6, A and B). Additionally, the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide had no effect on the ability of phosphate to trigger Fru-1,6-P2 synthesis and to protect against SICD in this mutant (Fig. 6, A and B). The results show that protection against SICD does not involve phosphate signaling or protein synthesis. Succinate is synthesized in the mitochondrial matrix in the Krebs cycle and in the cytosol in the glyoxylate cycle. Cytosolic succinate is transported into mitochondria by two transporters. Dic1 transports cytosolic succinate into the mitochondrial matrix in exchange for matrix phosphate. Sfc1 transports cytosolic succinate into the mitochondrial matrix in exchange for matrix fumarate (33Palmieri L. Vozza A. Hönlinger A. Dietmeier K. Palmisano A. Zara V. Palmieri F. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 569-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). If added succinate enters mitochondria through the Dic1 transporter, the mitochondrial matrix phosphate should be depleted, resulting in the inhibition of respiration and ATP synthesis, which protects cells from SICD. Thus, if Dic1 is deleted, succinate should fail to protect against SICD. To test this hypothesis, the effects of succinate and phosphate on the survival of stationary-phase dic1Δ, sdh1Δ, sfc1Δ, and wild-type cells in glucose/water were determined. Succinate increased the survival of sdh1Δ (1.7-fold), sfc1Δ (2.3-fold), and wild-type (9.8-fold) cells, but not that of dic1Δ cells, whereas phosphate increased the survival of all strains (Fig. 7A). In parallel experiments conducted in water, succinate was toxic to sdh1Δ, sfc1Δ, and wild-type cells but less so to dic1Δ cells (Fig. 7B). Succinate also failed to decrease O2 consumption of dic1Δ cells in glucose/water and water (Fig. 7, C and D). The results indicate that the Dic1 phosphate-succinate exchanger mediates succinate protection against SICD. We hypothesized that acetate protects against SICD because it is converted to succinate via the glyoxylate cycle. Succinate derived from added acetate then inhibits respiration and oxidative phosphorylation through the Dic1 transporter. On this basis, we expected that acetate would fail to protect stationary-phase icl1Δ and dic1Δ cells in glucose/water because the former mutant cannot make succinate and the latter cannot exchange cytosolic succinate for matrix phosphate, and this is what we found (Fig. 8). Acetate also failed to protect sdh1Δ cells. For comparison, the effect of succinate on the various mutants is shown. The results show that protection by acetate is mediated by the glyoxylate and Krebs cycles. Stationary-phase yeast cells in glucose/water consume O2 at a much higher rate compared with cells treated with glucose in other media (Table 1). Our interpretation of this phenomenon is that the Crabtree effect, which normally occurs upon exposure to glucose, fails when cells are grown in glucose/water, and this is the underlying basis for SICD. More specifically, the Crabtree effect fails because of a low level of Fru-1,6-P2. Phosphate and succinate each can restore the Crabtree effect, but they do so by different mechanisms. ROS accumulate and trigger rapid cell death when stationary-phase cells are grown in glucose/water (15Granot D. Levine A. Dor-Hefetz E. FEMS Yeast Res. 2003; 4: 7-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Consistent with this previous work, we found that ascorbic acid abolished ROS accumulation and increased the survival of stationary-phase cells in glucose/water (Fig. 1E), although phosphate protected even better. The ROS accumulation due to the failure of the Crabtree effect is likely the result of both excess O2 consumption and ROS production. Although antioxidants neutralize most of the ROS, the most effective way to increase survival is to inhibit O2 consumption by adding phosphate. The results in this study are consistent with added phosphate entering cells and triggering the synthesis of Fru-1,6-P2 (Table 2). No involvement of the phosphate signaling pathway was uncovered (Fig. 6). We propose that stationary-phase cells in glucose/water have a suboptimal level of cytosolic phosphate, and because phosphate allosterically activates phosphofructokinase to synthesize Fru-1,6-P2 (25Bañuelos M. Gancedo C. Gancedo J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 6394-6398Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a suboptimal level of cytosolic phosphate results in a suboptimal level of Fru-1,6-P2. Adding phosphate corrects the cytosolic phosphate deficit, which then enables phosphofructokinase to synthesize more Fru-1,6-P2. Fru-1,6-P2 suppresses ATP synthesis and respiration (6Díaz-Ruiz R. Avéret N. Araiza D. Pinson B. Uribe-Carvajal S. Devin A. Rigoulet M. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 26948-26955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), which protects cells from SICD. Consistent with this model, 2,5-AM also protects against SICD (Fig. 5). Our model stipulates that late-stage stationary-phase cells transferred into glucose/water have a suboptimal level of cytosolic phosphate. Numerous studies, using quite different methods, have analyzed the changes in phosphate and polyphosphate levels in S. cerevisiae cells as a function of growth at 30 °C (26Katchman B.J. Fetty W.O. J. Bacteriol. 1955; 69: 607-615Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Werner T.P. Amrhein N. Freimoser F.M. Arch. Microbiol. 2005; 184: 129-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 34Salhany J.M.

Plant Cell Physiol. 1996; 37: 1090-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In general, the polyphosphate pool peaks at late exponential phase (∼15 h in culture; A = 3–4) and then decreases by as much as 80% in the post-diauxic phase (∼24 h in culture; A = 8–10) (27Werner T.P. Amrhein N. Freimoser F.M. Arch. Microbiol. 2005; 184: 129-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Cytosolic phosphate also decreases over the same time frame (26Katchman B.J. Fetty W.O. J. Bacteriol. 1955; 69: 607-615Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Shirahama K. Yazaki Y. Sakano K. Wada Y. Ohsumi Y. Plant Cell Physiol. 1996; 37: 1090-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). One study detected a 50% decrease in cytosolic phosphate as cells grew from a density of 1.0 × 107 to 1.2 × 108 cells/ml (26Katchman B.J. Fetty W.O. J. Bacteriol. 1955; 69: 607-615Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Another study showed that a 20% decrease in cytosolic phosphate levels occurs after transferring exponential-phase cells in rich media into phosphate-depleted media (35Shirahama K. Yazaki Y. Sakano K. Wada Y. Ohsumi Y. Plant Cell Physiol. 1996; 37: 1090-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar); these authors concluded that the vacuolar polyphosphate pool can sustain cell growth during phosphate starvation for a “couple of rounds of the cell cycle.” We suggest that the vacuolar polyphosphate pool and cytosolic phosphate should be depleted even faster at 37 °C, which is probably why the SICD phenotype is stronger at 37 °C than at 30 °C. Overall, it seems reasonable that late stationary-phase cells transferred into glucose/water can have a reduced level of cytosolic phosphate, perhaps by as much as 50%, compared with exponential-phase cells in rich media. This study identified the Dic1 phosphate-succinate exchanger as mediating succinate protection against SICD. We propose that added succinate enters mitochondria through Dic1 in exchange for matrix phosphate and that decreasing the mitochondrial matrix phosphate level inhibits respiration and ATP synthesis (TABLE 1, TABLE 2), which in turn protects from SICD. Consistent with this model, succinate fails to protect against SICD in the dic1Δ mutant (Fig. 7A). Succinate is harmful to stationary-phase cells in water (Fig. 7B). Mechanistically, succinate is harmful to stationary-phase cells in water because it inhibits respiration and oxidative phosphorylation, as described above. Because starved cells strictly rely on mitochondria for viability (36Lin S.J. Kaeberlein M. Andalis A.A. Sturtz L.A. Defossez P.A. Culotta V.C. Fink G.R. Guarente L. Nature. 2002; 418: 344-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (863) Google Scholar, 37Bonawitz N.D. Chatenay-Lapointe M. Pan Y. Shadel G.S. Cell Metab. 2007; 5: 265-277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar), any compound that inhibits mitochondrial function will harm starved cells. Acetate partially protects stationary-phase WT cells from SICD and is slightly toxic to starved cells (Fig. 3, A and B). We propose that this acetate effect is due to the conversion of acetate to succinate via the glyoxylate cycle (33Palmieri L. Vozza A. Hönlinger A. Dietmeier K. Palmisano A. Zara V. Palmieri F. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 569-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). This hypothesis was tested by deleting the glyoxylate cycle gene that codes for isocitrate lyase (icl1Δ). In the cytosol, added acetate is converted to acetyl-CoA. Acetyl-CoA condenses with oxaloacetate to yield citrate, which then converts to isocitrate. Icl1 catalyzes the cleavage of isocitrate into succinate and glyoxylate. Succinate then enters mitochondria through the Dic1 and Sfc1 transporters. We found that the icl1Δ mutant, like the Krebs cycle mutants, failed to grow on acetate, increased survival, decreased O2 consumption, and failed to accumulate ROS (Fig. 2 and Table 1). Because these two metabolic cycles share common intermediates, disruption of one of these cycles perturbs the other. Thus, functionally, icl1Δ is similar to the Krebs cycle mutants: the down-regulated respiration and oxidative phosphorylation activity protect cells from SICD. The failure of acetate to protect stationary-phase dic1Δ and icl1Δ cells from SICD (Fig. 8) supports our hypothesis that acetate is converted to succinate in the glyoxylate cycle. First, acetate fails to protect dic1Δ cells because cytosolic succinate cannot enter mitochondria through the Dic1 phosphate-succinate exchanger in this mutant. Second, acetate fails to protect icl1Δ cells because the glyoxylate cycle conversion of acetate to cytosolic succinate is blocked in this mutant. Note that sdh1Δ cells cannot utilize acetate, and acetate indeed fails to protect this mutant from SICD. In sum, we have shown that phosphate and succinate are potent prosurvival Crabtree inducers that inhibit SICD by different mechanisms. Our results show that down-regulating respiration and oxidative phosphorylation protects cells from SICD but is very harmful to starved cells, which strictly rely on mitochondria for energy production.

However, how the transcriptional activity of TR4 is regulated in the absence of ligand(s) remains largely unknown. Here we found that an androgen receptor (AR) coactivator, ARA55, might function as a corepressor to suppress TR4 transactivation. Molecular mechanistic dissection with mutation analysis found that ARA55 could enhance TR4 acetylation at the conserved acetylation sites of lysine 175 and lysine 176 in the DNA-binding domain via recruiting proteins with histone acetyl transferase activity, which might then reduce significantly the TR4 DNA binding activity that resulted in the suppression of TR4 transactivation. These results are in contrast to the classic ARA55 coactivator function to enhance AR transactivation partially via increased AR acetylation in the hinge/ligand-binding domain. Together, these results not only provide a novel functional mechanism showing that acetylation of different nuclear receptors at different domains by coregulator may lead to differential receptor transactivation activity but also provide a new way for small molecules to control TR4 transactivation via altering TR4 acetylation levels, and such small molecules may have potential therapeutic applications in the future.

Here we identified ARA55 as a corepressor of TR4 via increasing acetylation levels of TR4 in the DBD, suggesting that the distinct coregulator effects of ARA55 on AR and TR4 could be partly due to diverse effects of non-histone protein acetylation in the different functional domains.

In the search for coregulators that can alter TR4 transactivation for the potential therapeutic agents to modulate TR4-mediated physiological functions, we identified ARA55, an AR coactivator, which could also interact with TR4 protein. Interestingly, we found that although ARA55 enhanced AR transactivation in 293T cells (Fig. 1A, left panel) in a ligand-dependent manner (1Fujimoto N. Yeh S. Kang H.Y. Inui S. Chang H.C. Mizokami A.

We further confirmed these contrasting findings by assaying the effect of ARA55 on the TR4 direct target gene CD36 expression in mouse liver Hep1-6 cell line and found TR4 enhanced CD36 mRNA expression. The addition of ARA55 resulted in the suppression of TR4-mediated CD36 mRNA expression (Fig. 1B). Western blot analysis also confirmed the suppression of TR4-induced CD36 expression by ARA55 at protein levels (Fig. 1C). Together, results from Fig. 1 (A–C) demonstrated that ARA55 coregulator could modulate AR and TR4 nuclear receptors in opposite ways. Early studies documented well that the acetylation of AR at the hinge/LBD is required for the ARAR55-enhanced AR transactivation (22Fu M. Rao M. Wang C. Sakamaki T. Wang J. Di Vizio D. Zhang X.

ARA55 could recruit HATs to enhance AR transactivation, and ARA55 showed little influence on the transactivation of mutant AR that failed to be acetylated (22Fu M. Rao M. Wang C. Sakamaki T. Wang J.

We were interested to see whether the contrasting effects of ARA55 on suppression, instead of promotion of TR4 transactivation could be due to ARA55-mediated acetylation on TR4 at different functional domains. We first examined whether TR4 is an acetylated protein. Sequence analysis found the conserved acetylation motif (RLKK) in many nuclear receptors, including AR, estrogen receptor, and TR4 (Fig. 2A). Interestingly, both AR and estrogen receptor α have their conserved acetylation motif ((R/K)XKK) located in the hinge/LBD, whereas TR4 conserved acetylation motif (RLKK) was found in the DBD. Early studies suggested that acetylation on the DBD of several transcriptional factors, such as FOXO1 (19Matsuzaki H. Daitoku H. Hatta M. Aoyama H. Yoshimochi K. Fukamizu A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 11278-11283Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar) and YY1 (20Yao Y.L. Yang W.M. Seto E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5979-5991Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar), resulted in the suppression of DNA binding affinity to their target genes. It is therefore possible that acetylation of TR4 on the DBD may also result in the suppression of its transactivation via reduction of DNA binding to its target genes. Here an extremely simplified model to explain this hypothesis is presented in Fig. 2B. To prove this interesting hypothesis, we assayed the influence of ARA55 on TR4 acetylation and transactivation. We found that the addition of ARA55 resulted in the increase of acetylation of wild type TR4 (TR4-WT) (Fig. 2C). We then constructed a TR4 mutant that is resistant to acetylation in DBD yet still maintains positive charges by converting the two lysine residues at 175 and 176 in the conserved acetylated motif sites of TR4 DBD into arginine (TR4-RR). Interestingly, this TR4 DBD mutant TR4-RR significantly impaired the enhanced TR4 acetylation level by ARA55 (Fig. 2E; the ratio of ARA55 to TR4-WT or TR4RR is higher than in Fig. 2C), supporting the hypothesis that ARA55 will modulate TR4 acetylation of the putative acetylation sites in its DBD. Our data also suggested that TR4 might be acetylated in other regions. Consistently, luciferase reporter assay found that adding ARA55 could suppress TR4-WT transactivation but enhance TR4-RR transactivation (Fig. 2D). These results from Fig. 2 (A–E) suggest that ARA55 may suppress TR4 transactivation via reduction of DNA binding by recruiting HATs to acetylate TR4 on the DBD. Failure to acetylate TR4-RR may instead enable ARA55 to induce TR4-RR transactivation via recruitment of HATs to enhance only histone acetylation. We applied two more approaches to strengthen the above conclusion that TR4 could be acetylated at the TR4 DBD. First, via anti-acetyl lysine antibody assay, we found that the addition of TSA, a HDAC inhibitor, could increase the TR4-WT acetylation. In contrast, TSA showed much less effect on the TR4-RR acetylation (Fig. 2F), suggesting that TR4 could be acetylated at residues 175 and 176 sites of conserved acetylated motif in the TR4 DBD. We then used another TR4 coregulator CBP to confirm our above finding. Unlike ARA55, which needs to recruit other coregulators with HAT activity, CBP has intrinsic HAT activity (44Chan H.M. La Thangue N.B. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2363-2373Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our results showed that TR4 acetylation levels could be enhanced by CBP, but not mutant CBP (CBPΔHAT) that loses HAT activity (Fig. 2C), suggesting that TR4 could be acetylated directly by HATs, such as CBP. To dissect the molecular mechanism by which acetylation of TR4 in DBD results in the suppression of TR4 transactivation, we examined whether ARA55 could suppress TR4 transcriptional activity via suppression of TR4 DNA binding affinity. Using mammalian two-hybrid (Fig. 3A) and coimmunoprecipitation assays (Fig. 3B), we first proved that ARA55 could directly interact with TR4. We then preformed ChIP assay to determine whether ARA55 could influence TR4 binding to the target gene CD36 promoter in vivo. As shown in Fig. 4A, TR4 bound to CD36 promoter in vivo, and the addition of ARA55 resulted in the suppression of this in vivo binding. In contrast, the addition of ARA55 did not affect TR4-RR binding to CD36 promoter. We then applied EMSA to test whether acetylation influenced TR4 binding to its target genes. As shown in Fig. 4B, both TR4-WT and TR4-RR could bind to TR4 response elements (either DR1 or PPRE). In contrast, the other two TR4 mutants TR4-AA and TR4-QQ, in which we replaced lysine with either alanine or glutamine to mimic the constitutive acetylation form by neutralizing the positive charges within the DBD, bound only weakly to the TR4 response elements. These contrasting results suggested that the neutralization of the lysines basic residues of acetylation motif in the DBD via acetylation may result in the suppression of TR4 DNA binding affinity to its target gene promoters. As expected, the consequence of reduced DNA binding affinity in TR4-AA or TR4-QQ might then result in the suppression of TR4 transactivation (Fig. 4C).FIGURE 4Acetylation of TR4 suppresses TR4 transactivation via reduction of its DNA binding ability to its target gene. A, ARA55 reduces TR4 but not TR4RR binding to CD36 promoter in vivo. The ChIP assays were performed in Hep1-6 cells transfected with TR4 or/and ARA55. Anti-FLAG antibody was added to the lysate and incubated at 4 °C overnight. The primer pairs used in the PCR span the region of the CD36 promoter or the nonspecific region. B, TR4 acetylation mutants reduce the binding ability of TR4 to DNA. The 32P-labeled probes DR1 (first through fifth lanes) and PPRE (sixth through ninth lanes) were incubated with or without in vitro translated TR4 protein or TR4 acetylation mutant protein. The complexes were resolved in 4.5% polyacrylamide gels. The specific complex is indicated by an arrow. C, TR4 acetylation mutants reduce TR4 transcriptional activity. 293T cells were cotransfected with CD36-luc, pCMX-TR4, or different pCMX-TR4 acetylation mutant plasmids. After 24 h, the cells were harvested, and luciferase activities were examined. IP, immunoprecipitation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To further confirm that acetylation of TR4-DBD might contribute to ARA55-mediated suppression of TR4 physiological functions, we assayed the changes of mRNA and protein expression of TR4 target gene CD36 in the TR4 and TR4 mutants. The addition of ARA55 resulted in the suppression of CD36 mRNA and protein expression. In contrast, the addition of ARA55 resulted in TR4-RR-mediated CD36 induction at both mRNA (Fig. 5A) and protein (Fig. 5B) expressions in Hep1-6 cells. Together, results from FIGURE 4, FIGURE 5 clearly demonstrate that the addition of ARA55 to interact with TR4 might lead to increased TR4 acetylation in the DBD, which might then result in the suppression of TR4-mediated physiological function. Here we revealed that TR4 transactivation could be modulated by acetylation and deacetylation without adding its ligands. Our results are in contrast to the classic coactivator role of ARA55 that promoted AR transactivation via increased acetylation levels. The diverse yet opposite effects of acetylation on the transactivation of different nuclear receptors is believed to be largely dependent on the acetylation sites on the different domains (21Glozak M.A. Sengupta N. Zhang X. Seto E. Gene. 2005; 363: 15-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (1292) Google Scholar). AR is acetylated on lysines located in the hinge/LBD. It was reported that AR acetylation might lead to modulated AR ubiquitination and recruitment of coactivators and corepressors (22Fu M. Rao M. Wang C. Sakamaki T. Wang J. Di Vizio D. Zhang X. Albanese C. Balk S. Chang C. Fan S. Rosen E. Palvimo J.J. Janne O.A. Muratoglu S. Avantaggiati M.L. Pestell R.G. Mol. Cell.

Pestell R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3373-3388Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). In contrast, TR4 can be acetylated at two conserved lysines that are located within the DBD. Early studies found that acetylation of several transcription factors on the DBD all resulted in a decrease of their DNA binding activity, such as FOXO1 and YY1 (19Matsuzaki H. Daitoku H. Hatta M. Aoyama H. Yoshimochi K. Fukamizu A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 11278-11283Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar, 20Yao Y.L. Yang W.M. Seto E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5979-5991Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). Here we showed that these two basic lysine residues in the TR4 DBD might also contribute to the interaction of TR4 with negatively charged phosphate residues in the minor groove of the DNA. Acetylation of TR4 DBD thus reduces TR4 DNA binding affinity by neutralization of the positive charges of these two lysine residues. To our knowledge, TR4 is the first nuclear receptor found to be acetylated in the DBD. The finding that ARA55 suppressed wild type TR4 but enhanced TR4 acetylation mutant activity suggested that TR4 acetylation plays a dominant role in ARA55-mediated TR4 transactivation. However, we do not rule out other mechanisms by which ARA55 suppresses TR4 transcriptional activities. Coregulators may be able to modulate nuclear receptor transactivation in many ways, for example, via regulating nuclear receptor dimerization, protein stability, and competing with other limited cellular resources (45McKenna N.J. O'Malley B.W. Cell. 2002; 108: 465-474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1253) Google Scholar). Modulation of TR4 transactivation via acetylation could be vital for TR4 in vivo functions. Although lipid ligand/activators can activate TR4 transactivation (36Xie S. Lee Y.F. Kim E. Chen L.M. Ni J. Fang L.Y. Liu S. Lin S.J. Abe J. Berk B. Ho F.M. Chang C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 13353-13358Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 41Tsai N.P. Huq M. Gupta P. Yamamoto K.

Our findings here showed that TR4 can be modulated via acetylation, which provides a platform to utilize the small molecules that can modulate TR4 acetylation to control the diverse biological functions. Currently, several clinical trials using small molecule HDAC inhibitors are in the process of being tested for their effects on cancer, brain disorders, heart diseases, and aging (49Close P.

HDAC inhibitors have been successful in many clinical trials but also faced significant challenges, such as cardiac side effects (51Kazantsev A.G. Thompson L.M. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2008; 7: 854-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). TR4 is essential in many physiological processes and shows both beneficial and detrimental effects in animal models. HDAC inhibitors increase TR4 acetylation levels to suppress TR4 activity in vitro. However, it remains to be determined how different HDAC inhibitors affect TR4 activity in vivo in different tissues. HDAC inhibitors have a broad range of targets, with both histones and non-histone proteins, and thus may affect TR4 transactivation in a cell- or tissue-specific manner. TR4 acetylation may also respond differentially to different stress or stimuli or different HDAC inhibitors in different tissues. It is also possible that TR4 acetylation may affect TR4 phosphorylation, TR4-coregulator interactions, or protein stability. Taken together, our results may warrant further study of small molecules or HDAC inhibitors that can influence TR4 acetylation in a tissue-specific manner to battle various TR4-mediated diseases."

IntroductionThe HIV-1 pandemic continues to spread worldwide. It would be desirable to have a protective vaccine, but despite massive effort over the past 20 years such a vaccine remains elusive. Live attenuated vaccines have provided the most robust protection against viral challenge in animal models, but they are considered unsafe for human use (1Almond N. Kent K. Cranage M. Rud E. Clarke B. Stott E.J. Lancet. 1995; 345: 1342-1344Abstract PubMed Google Scholar, 2Bogers W.M. Niphuis H. ten Haaft P. Laman J.D. Koornstra W. Heeney J.L.

Moreover, the immune correlates of protection by live attenuated vaccines remain undefined, hampering the design of safer vaccines (4Koff W.C. Johnson P.R. Watkins D.I. Burton D.R. Lifson J.D.

T cell-based vaccines can partially control viral replication and reduce the viral set point in animal models (5Hansen S.G. Vieville C. Whizin N. Coyne-Johnson L. Siess D.C. Drummond D.D.

The infusion of nAb b12 directed against the CD4-binding site (CD4BS) on gp120 inhibited vaginal infection with SHIV in a dose-dependent manner (13Parren P.W. Marx P.A. Hessell A.J. Luckay A.

Passive immunization with the b12 nAb 2–18 h after viral challenge did not block HIV-1 infection, showing that the time window for nAb to provide protection against HIV-1 acquisition is limited (19Foresman L.

Thus, preexisting nAb can provide sterilizing protection, but inducing them with current vaccines has been unsuccessful.Formulating antigens in adjuvants can improve their immunogenicity. Commonly used adjuvants that stimulate the innate immune system include agonists of pattern recognition receptors such as Toll-like receptors, as well as inorganic molecules, emulsion surfactants, or other carrier molecules that have immune stimulating properties (20Guy B. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2007; 5: 505-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). An alternative, more specific approach is the use of co-stimulatory host-derived proteins that activate specific immune cells. The adjuvant effects of such co-stimulatory molecules can be increased by covalently linking them directly to the antigen of choice (21Wille-Reece U. Flynn B.J. Lore K. Koup R.A. Kedl R.M.

This cytokine is produced by fibroblasts, activated T lymphocytes, macrophages, and tumor, endothelial, mesothelial, and epithelial cells and functions as a hematopoietic growth factor. GM-CSF is secreted during various types of inflammation to stimulate proliferation and prevents apoptosis of various immune cells (25Deresinski S.C.

Its activity is mediated by the GM-CSF receptor (GMR) that is composed of a specific α-GMR domain and a commonly shared βc subunit that is also a part of the IL-3 and IL-5 cytokine receptor. Signaling is mediated by the formation of a hexameric complex consisting of two GM-CSF molecules and the four receptor subunits. Ultimately, two of these GM-CSF-GMR hexamers can dimerize to form a dodecameric complex. Depending on the GM-CSF concentration and the nature of the ligand-receptor complex, GM-CSF can induce different downstream signaling cascades. Low picomolar concentrations of the cytokine promote cell survival, whereas higher GM-CSF concentrations can stimulate cell proliferation.Here we investigated whether GM-CSF embedded within the HIV-1 trimeric gp140 can augment Env-specific immune responses. The rationale for integrating GM-CSF within the Env protein was to simultaneously activate immune cells that are targeted by the antigen, resulting in a selective and specific augmentation of the antigen-specific immune response. To do this, the first and second variable loop domain (V1V2) of Env was replaced by GM-CSF. The resulting chimeric EnvGM-CSF was folded properly and had GM-CSF activity in vitro. Mice immunized with the chimeric protein had stronger Env-specific Ab and T cell responses than those given unmodified Env protein. Embedding the cytokine domains is therefore useful for enhancing the immunogenicity of HIV-1 Env-based vaccines.DISCUSSIONTo improve the immunogenicity of HIV-1 Env vaccines, we constructed a chimeric gp140 trimer in which the V1V2 region of gp120 was replaced by the GM-CSF cytokine. We selected GM-CSF because it has a well defined adjuvant activity, and usage in humans has been shown to be safe. We found that the chimeric EnvGM-CSF protein was more immunogenic than the unmodified Env trimers in mice, with improvements in both Ab and T helper responses.Adjuvants can be more powerful when they are coupled directly to antigen rather than when the two components are supplied as a mixture. For example, conjugating oligodeoxynucleotides (CpG ODN) to a Gag protein enhances the magnitude and quality of Gag-specific T cell responses (21Wille-Reece U. Flynn B.J. Lore K. Koup R.A. Kedl R.M.

In earlier studies, the immune response was improved by linking HIV-1 Env antigens directly to co-stimulatory molecules such as C3d, tumor necrosis factor α (TNF), Fms-like tyrosine kinase receptor-3 ligand, or Fas ligand (FasL) (23Koch M. Frazier J. Sodroski J. Wyatt R. Virology. 2005; 340: 277-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 24Bower J.F. Yang X. Sodroski J. Ross T.M. J.

Vaccine. 2007; 25: 2306-2315Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The advantage of chimeric adjuvant fusion proteins over chemically linked adjuvant antigens complexes is that the former can be produced easily directly from DNA at a constant antigen to adjuvant ratio.Instead of linking the co-stimulatory adjuvant molecules such as FasL or TNFα to the N or C termini of Env, we replaced the V1V2 loop domain with the co-stimulatory GM-CSF molecule. The V1V2 loop was selected because this region can be deleted from Env without compromising the structure and, to some extent, the function of the protein (31Bontjer I. Melchers M. Eggink D. David K.

Flexible linkers were added at the Env-GM-CSF junctions to enable the cytokine to fold independently into a native structure and to reduce the possibility of a steric clash between the two components of the chimera. The chimeric EnvGM-CSF protein was expressed efficiently in 293T cells as a secreted trimer (Fig. 2). Ab binding to most Env epitopes was very similar to that seen with the corresponding, unmodified Env, with the exception of the b12 and CD4i epitopes close to the GM-CSF insertion site, which were affected modestly (Fig. 3).Although GM-CSF embedded into Env was functional, it did not stimulate TF-1 cell proliferation to the same level as recombinant, soluble GM-CSF (Fig. 4). It is possible that, despite the use of flexible linkers, GM-CSF binding to its receptor is partially blocked by proximal regions of Env. Alternatively, one GM-CSF molecule may be able to bind to the GMR normally, but the formation of a ternary dodecameric complex is affected, limiting downstream signaling (51Hercus T.R. Thomas D.

In theory, the binding of Env to CD4 on TF-1 cells could counteract the proliferative activity of GM-CSF (54Gibellini D. Zauli G. Re M.C. Furlini G. Lolli S. Borgatti P. Capitani S. La Placa M. New Microbiol. 1994; 17: 85-92PubMed Google Scholar). This explanation, however, seems unlikely, because the addition of Envwt did not affect the activation of TF-1 cells by rhGM-CSF (data not shown).The serum half-life of recombinant GM-CSF is short, varying from 0.9 to 2.5 h (55Stute N. Furman W.L. Schell M. Evans W.E. J. Pharm. Sci. 1995; 84: 824-828Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 56Furman W.L. Fairclough D.L. Huhn R.D. Pratt C.B. Stute N. Petros W.P.

This factor could adversely influence the adjuvant effect of GM-CSF, particularly when the immunogen and cytokine are either mixed or transcribed from separate plasmids. How fusion of Env with GM-CSF affects the half-life of both proteins requires further study.Chimeric proteins such as those described here have not been described previously, but GM-CSF has been used as an adjuvant in vaccine studies with a variety of results. Co-delivering GM-CSF in peptide-based vaccines, either as recombinant protein or plasmid DNA, augments HIV-1-specific T cell responses to various extents (57Spearman P. Kalams S. Elizaga M. Metch B.

Co-delivery of rhesus macaque GM-CSF expressed from DNA with Gag, Pol, and Env DNA followed by an MVA boost results in higher avidity anti-Env Ab in rhesus macaques (60Robinson H.L. Montefiori D.C.

Mice immunized with a bicistronic plasmid encoding gp120 and GM-CSF have stronger gp120-specific CD4+ T cell responses than mice immunized with gp120 and GM-CSF on two separate plasmids (61Barouch D.H. Santra S. Tenner-Racz K. Racz P. Kuroda M.J. Schmitz J.E. Jackson S.S. Lifton M.A. Freed D.C. Perry H.C. Davies M.E. Shiver J.W. Letvin N.L. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 562-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Hence, the method of GM-CSF co-delivery affects the outcome of the immune response. The timing of GM-CSF co-delivery also influences the induction of the response. In one study, delivery of a GM-CSF plasmid prior to vaccination with a plasmid encoding a vaccine antigen yielded a Th2-type response, whereas GM-CSF delivery after vaccination with the same antigen resulted in a Th1-type response. Both Th1 and Th2 responses are generated when GM-CSF and antigen are administered simultaneously (62Kusakabe K. Xin K.Q. Katoh H. Sumino K. Hagiwara E. Kawamoto S. Okuda K. Miyagi Y. Aoki I. Nishioka K. Klinman D. Okuda K. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 3102-3111Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Although Ab to recombinant human GM-CSF protein (rhGM-CSF) arose when it was used in a human vaccine trial, they caused neither adverse hematologic events nor a loss of GM-CSF function (57Spearman P. Kalams S. Elizaga M. Metch B. Chiu Y.L. Allen M. Weinhold K.J. Ferrari G. Parker S.D. McElrath M.J. Frey S.E. Fuchs J.D. Keefer M.C. Lubeck M.D. Egan M. Braun R. Eldridge J.H. Haynes B.F. Corey L. Vaccine. 2009; 27: 243-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar).We initially chose to introduce GM-CSF as a co-stimulatory molecule, but other molecules could be incorporated as well. A number of cytokines can increase the immunogenicity of HIV vaccines. Co-administration of murine IL-12 with HIV-1 Env pDNA markedly enhances the cell-mediated immune response in mice (59Xu R. Megati S. Roopchand V. Luckay A. Masood A. Garcia-Hand D. Rosati M. Weiner D.B. Felber B.K. Pavlakis G.N. Sidhu M.K. Eldridge J.H.

Other cytokines such as IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IL-15, and IL-18 can augment the humoral and/or cell-mediated immune responses to HIV and non-HIV antigens (63Chakrabarti R. Chang Y. Song K.

Vaccine. 2008; 26: 5111-5122Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar).However, some limitations need to be recognized when incorporating cytokines into the Env backbone. First, the length and molecular weight of the inserted protein should probably be similar to the replaced V1V2 region, which spans 60 to 80 amino acids, including 6 glycans (in total ∼20 kDa). Moreover, the N and C termini of the folded cytokine preferably should be close together such that the bulk of the protein protrudes away from the Env protein. Another constraint is the oligomeric state of the cytokine; it is unlikely that dimeric molecules, such as IL-10 or IL-12 (69Fujiwara Y. Aiki Y. Yang L. Takaiwa F. Kosaka A. Tsuji N.M. Shiraki K. Sekikawa K. Protein Expr. Purif. 2010; 72: 125-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 70Ling P. Gately M.K. Gubler U. Stern A.S. Lin P. Hollfelder K. Su C. Pan Y.C. Hakimi J. J.

Taking these constraints into account, we have recently succeeded in replacing the V1V2 region with a functional human IL-4. 4T. van Montfort, G. Isik, and R. W. Sanders, unpublished observations.In conclusion, we have shown that embedding a cytokine within an HIV-1 Env trimer improves the immunogenicity of the Env moiety. This approach may be useful when considering how to develop an HIV-1 vaccine aimed at inducing protective humoral immunity. IntroductionThe HIV-1 pandemic continues to spread worldwide. It would be desirable to have a protective vaccine, but despite massive effort over the past 20 years such a vaccine remains elusive. Live attenuated vaccines have provided the most robust protection against viral challenge in animal models, but they are considered unsafe for human use (1Almond N. Kent K. Cranage M. Rud E. Clarke B. Stott E.J. Lancet. 1995; 345: 1342-1344Abstract PubMed Google Scholar, 2Bogers W.M. Niphuis H. ten Haaft P. Laman J.D. Koornstra W. Heeney J.L.

Moreover, the immune correlates of protection by live attenuated vaccines remain undefined, hampering the design of safer vaccines (4Koff W.C. Johnson P.R. Watkins D.I. Burton D.R. Lifson J.D.

Immunol. 2006; 7: 19-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar).Ideally, a vaccine should induce strong humoral and cellular immune responses that are protective against the extensive variety of HIV-1 strains that are now circulating. T cell-based vaccines can partially control viral replication and reduce the viral set point in animal models (5Hansen S.G. Vieville C. Whizin N. Coyne-Johnson L. Siess D.C. Drummond D.D.

The infusion of nAb b12 directed against the CD4-binding site (CD4BS) on gp120 inhibited vaginal infection with SHIV in a dose-dependent manner (13Parren P.W. Marx P.A. Hessell A.J. Luckay A.

Passive immunization with the b12 nAb 2–18 h after viral challenge did not block HIV-1 infection, showing that the time window for nAb to provide protection against HIV-1 acquisition is limited (19Foresman L.

Thus, preexisting nAb can provide sterilizing protection, but inducing them with current vaccines has been unsuccessful.Formulating antigens in adjuvants can improve their immunogenicity. Commonly used adjuvants that stimulate the innate immune system include agonists of pattern recognition receptors such as Toll-like receptors, as well as inorganic molecules, emulsion surfactants, or other carrier molecules that have immune stimulating properties (20Guy B"
https://openalex.org/W2151511690,"The helicase and primase activities of the hexameric ring-shaped T7 gp4 protein reside in two separate domains connected by a linker region. This linker region is part of the subunit interface between monomers, and point mutations in this region have deleterious effects on the helicase functions. One such linker region mutant, A257T, is analogous to the A359T mutant of the homologous human mitochondrial DNA helicase Twinkle, which is linked to diseases such as progressive external opthalmoplegia. Electron microscopy studies show that A257T gp4 is normal in forming rings with dTTP, but the rings do not assemble efficiently on the DNA. Therefore, A257T, unlike the WT gp4, does not preassemble on the unwinding DNA substrate with dTTP without Mg(II), and its DNA unwinding activity in ensemble assays is slow and limited by the DNA loading rate. Single molecule assays measured a 45 times slower rate of A257T loading on DNA compared with WT gp4. Interestingly, once loaded, A257T has almost WT-like translocation and DNA unwinding activities. Strikingly, A257T preassembles stably on the DNA in the presence of T7 DNA polymerase, which restores the ensemble unwinding activity of A257T to ∼75% of WT, and the rescue does not require DNA synthesis. The DNA loading rate of A257T, however, remains slow even in the presence of the polymerase, which explains why A257T does not support T7 phage growth. Similar types of defects in the related human mitochondrial DNA helicase may be responsible for inefficient DNA replication leading to the disease states."
https://openalex.org/W2091071305,"Ten years ago, we introduced a fluorescent probe that shed light on the inside-out regulation of one of the major leukocyte integrins, very late antigen-4 (VLA-4, CD49d/CD29). Here we describe the regulation of another leukocyte integrin, lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1, CD11a/CD18) using a novel small fluorescent probe in real time on live cells. We found that multiple signaling mechanisms regulate LFA-1 conformation in a manner analogous to VLA-4. LFA-1 can be rapidly activated by Gαi-coupled G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and deactivated by Gαs-coupled GPCRs. The effects of Gαs-coupled GPCR agonists can be reversed in real time by receptor-specific antagonists. The specificity of the fluorescent probe binding has been assessed in a competition assay using the natural LFA-1 ligand ICAM-1 and the LFA-1-specific α I allosteric antagonist BIRT0377. Similar to VLA-4 integrin, modulation of the ligand dissociation rate can be observed for different LFA-1 affinity states. However, we also found a striking difference in the binding of the small fluorescent ligand. In the absence of inside-out activation ligand, binding to LFA-1 is extremely slow, at least 10 times slower than expected for diffusion-limited binding. This implies that an additional structural mechanism prevents ligand binding to inactive LFA-1. We propose that such a mechanism explains the inability of LFA-1 to support cell rolling, where the absence of its rapid engagement by a counterstructure in the inactive state leads to a requirement for a selectin-mediated rolling step.

A number of LFA-1 and VLA-4 antagonists (antibodies, peptides, and small molecules) have been developed and are undergoing clinical trials (6Shimaoka M. Springer T.A. Nat. Rev.

Thus, the ability to understand and to regulate VLA-4- and LFA-1-dependent cell adhesion may be critical for the development of successful therapeutic approaches. lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1 (CD11a/CD18, αLβ2 integrin) N-formyl-l-methionyl-l-leucyl-l-phenylalanyl-l-phenylalanine (formyl peptide) formyl peptide receptor G protein-coupled receptor intercellular adhesion molecule (CD54) junctional adhesion molecule mean channel fluorescence (equivalent of mean fluorescence intensity) peripheral blood mononuclear cell phycoerythrin vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (CD106) very late antigen-4 (CD49d/CD29, α4β1 integrin). In general, integrin-dependent cell adhesion is regulated by rapid conformational changes within the molecule as well as molecular redistribution (clustering), which result from cellular signaling. Numerous proinflammatory immune ligands, chemoattractants, and chemokines can initiate this signaling cascade, often acting through heterotrimeric G proteins (8Alon R. Feigelson S.W. Microcirculation. 2009; 16: 3-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 9Laudanna C. Kim J.Y. Constantin G. Butcher E. Immunol.

This, so-called inside-out signaling pathway serves as the basis for rapid cell adhesion and chemotaxis toward sites of inflammation and secondary lymphoid tissues. Rapid integrin activation represents a mechanism for the arrest of rolling leukocytes on the endothelial surface under shear flow (12Laudanna C. Alon R. Thromb. Haemost. 2006; 95: 5-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Information about the intricate real-time conformational regulation of the VLA-4 integrin and the inside-out signaling pathway was obtained with a fluorescent ligand-mimicking probe (10Hyduk S.J.

The goal of these current studies was the development of a fluorescent probe for the assessment of LFA-1 conformational regulation upon triggering of the inside-out signaling pathway. LFA-1 and VLA-4 exhibit important differences in 1) their expression profile (LFA-1 is exclusively a leukocyte integrin, whereas VLA-4 is also expressed on CD34+ stem cells and non-hematopoietic cells) (1Hyun Y.M.

Blood. 2005; 106: 1901-1910Crossref PubMed Scopus (816) Google Scholar); 2) structural features (LFA-1 contains an additional αA domain (α I domain), where the ligand binding site is localized) (19Shimaoka M.

Despite these differences, both integrins are implicated as therapeutic targets in diseases, where immunosuppression is envisioned to be beneficial (1Hyun Y.M. Lefort C.T. Kim M. Immunol.

Comparative studies of the two major integrins will provide invaluable information about similarities and differences in the regulation of integrin-dependent cell adhesion. Similarities will identify common signaling pathways that can be modulated upstream of integrin activation. Differences will help our understanding of the specific role of each leukocyte integrin. The current study 1) presents an LFA-1-specific, small fluorescent molecule probe; 2) illustrates the kinetics of probe binding upon triggering of inside-out signaling on live cells in real time; and 3) compares these results with a previously studied VLA-4-specific probe.

Human recombinant CXCL12/SDF-1α, recombinant human CXCL8/IL-8, and human recombinant ICAM-1-Fc chimera were from R&D Systems, Inc. Amthamine dihydrobromide (highly selective histamine H2 receptor agonist), tiotidine (histamine H2 receptor antagonist), isoproterenol hydrochloride (selective β-adrenoreceptor agonist), and 118,551-hydrochloride (selective β2-adrenergic receptor antagonist) were purchased from Tocris Bioscience. Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) was purchased from Mediatech, Inc. All other reagents were from Sigma-Aldrich. For integrin-specific compounds, stock solutions were prepared in DMSO, at concentrations ∼1000-fold higher than the final concentration. Usually, 1 μl of stock solution was added to 1 ml of cell suspension, yielding a final 0.1% DMSO concentration. Control samples were treated with an equal amount of pure DMSO (vehicle). Stock solutions of Gαs-coupled receptor agonists and antagonists were prepared in water, and control samples were treated with an equal amount of water (vehicle).

High receptor-expressing cells were sorted using a MoFlo flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter). Histamine H2 receptor and β2-adrenergic receptors are constitutively expressed on U937 cells (34Liggett S.B.

Cells were grown at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air in RPMI 1640 (supplemented with 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum). Cells were harvested and resuspended in 1 ml of HEPES buffer (110 mm NaCl, 10 mm KCl, 10 mm glucose, 1 mm MgCl2, 1.5 mm CaCl2 (or 10 mm MgCl2 and 1 mm EGTA for Mg/EGTA activation experiments) and 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) containing 0.1% human serum albumin and stored on ice. The buffer was depleted of lipopolysaccharide by affinity chromatography over polymyxin B-Sepharose (Detoxigel, Pierce). Cells were counted using the Coulter Multisizer/Z2 analyzer (Beckman Coulter). For experiments, cells were suspended in the same HEPES buffer at 1 × 106 cells/ml and warmed to 37 °C. Alternatively, cells were resuspended in warm RPMI (37 °C) and used immediately. Kinetic analysis of the binding and dissociation of the LFA-1 probe (compound 1) was performed in a manner analogous to the binding of the VLA-4-specific probe described previously (31Chigaev A. Blenc A.M. Braaten J.V. Kumaraswamy N. Kepley C.L. Andrews R.P. Oliver J.M. Edwards B.S. Prossnitz E.R. Larson R.S. Sklar L.A. J. Biol.

Briefly, cells (1 × 106 cells/ml) were preincubated in HEPES buffer containing 0.1% human serum albumin at different conditions for 10–20 min at 37 °C. Flow cytometric data were acquired continuously using a FACScan (BD Biosciences) flow cytometer for up to 1024 s at constant temperature (37 °C) while the samples were stirred continuously at 300 rpm with a 5 × 2-mm magnetic stir bar (Bel-Art Products). Samples were analyzed for 30–120 s to establish a base line. The fluorescent ligand was added, and acquisition was re-established, creating a 5–10-s gap in the time course, which can be observed in the figures. For real-time activation experiments, the LFA-1 probe was added at the concentrations indicated in the figure legends after establishing a base line for unstained cells marked as “autofluorescence.” Then data were acquired for 2–3 min, and cells were treated with the indicated GPCR ligands at a receptor-saturating concentration. In several experiments, cells were treated sequentially with two or more compounds. Acquisition was re-established, and data were acquired continuously up to 1024 s. For kinetic dissociation measurements, cell samples were preincubated with the indicated concentration of LFA-1 probe and treated with GPCR ligands and, as appropriate, excess unlabeled competitor (compound 3, 2 μm). The dissociation of the fluorescent probe was followed. The resulting data were converted to MCF versus time using the FCSQuery software developed by Dr. Bruce Edwards (University of New Mexico). Dissociation rate constants (koff) were obtained by fitting dissociation curves to a single exponential decay equation using GraphPad Prism software (GraphPad Software, Inc.). GPCR ligand concentrations were chosen based upon known binding affinities (36Booze R.M. Crisostomo E.A. Davis J.N. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1989; 249: 911-920PubMed Google Scholar, 37Foreman J.C.

This results in 66% or greater coverage of the receptor sites. For Gαs-coupled receptor binding site competition experiments (Fig. 4, A and B), lower agonist concentrations were chosen to limit potential rebinding after the addition of a large excess of antagonist (20-fold or more). The concentrations of antagonists were chosen based on their respective affinities, to cover more than 99% of the receptor binding sites (200-fold greater than Kd) (36Booze R.M. Crisostomo E.A.

In the absence of Gαi-coupled receptor activation, these Gαs-coupled receptor agonists and antagonists did not have significant effects upon probe binding. The expression of CD11a was measured with primary labeled (phycoerythrin) fluorescent mAbs and quantified by comparison with a standard curve generated using Quantum Simply Cellular anti-mouse IgG beads (Bangs Laboratories, Inc.) stained in parallel with the same mAb. This produces an estimate of the total mAb binding sites/cell. Typically, we find 200,000–250,000 LFA-1 sites/JY cell and 90,000–130,000 LFA-1 sites/U937 cell. These numbers were used to estimate maximal binding of the ligand to LFA-1 (i.e. Bmax) in binding curves. To estimate the effect of inside-out activation upon expression of LFA-1/CD11a, U937 cells were treated with 100 nm fMLFF for 5–10 min at 37 °C under conditions identical to those of the real-time activation experiments. Next, the cells were transferred to ice and stained with anti-CD11a or isotype control antibodies according to the manufacturer's instructions. For histogram analysis, 5000–10,000 events were collected. Conjugation (coupling) of fluorophores typically decreases the fluorescence quantum yield. Therefore, to quantify the number of fluorescent molecules bound to the cell surface, we determined the relative quantum yield of the LFA-1 fluorescent probe. Absorption-matched samples of carboxyfluorescein and the fluorescent LFA-1 probe (at 490 nm) were used to acquire emission spectra (supplemental Fig. 1). The relative amount of light transmitted through a 530/30 band pass filter (FL1 channel of the BD FACScan flow cytometer) was ∼0.56. This coefficient was used to calibrate the binding of the probe. The quantum FITC MESF (molecules of equivalent soluble fluorochromes) microsphere kit medium level (Bangs Laboratories, Inc.) was used to quantitate the fluorescence intensity of cells bearing the LFA-1 probe. Drops of beads were added to 0.5 ml of isotonic phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.2), and the MCF for all calibrated microbeads was collected. The MESF was plotted versus the MCF for the four fluorescent microbeads. The graph was used to estimate the total number of molecules of equivalent soluble fluorochromes/cell corresponding to the specific binding of the probe. Next, to calculate MESF values corrected for the differences in the relative quantum yield between fluorescein and LFA-1 probe, values corresponding to LFA-1 probe fluorescence were divided by the coefficient 0.56 (see “Determination of the Relative Fluorescence Quantum Yield”). These MESF values were used to estimate probe dissociation (Kd) constants. Human PBMCs were isolated by density gradient centrifugation. Venous blood anticoagulated with heparin or EDTA was obtained from healthy volunteers, and the buffy coat was layered over Ficoll Hypaque (Amersham Biosciences) and centrifuged at 1162 × g to obtain mononuclear leukocytes. Leukocytes were washed in DMEM (Invitrogen), resuspended in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, and used immediately. PBMCs were stained using anti-human CD14 PE, anti-human fMLP receptor, anti-human CD184 PE, and isotype control to identify cell subsets according to the manufacturer's instructions. Curve fits and statistics were performed using GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software, Inc.). Each experiment was repeated at least three times. The experimental curves represent the mean of two or more independent runs. The S.E. was calculated using GraphPad Prism. Previously, we developed a VLA-4-specific fluorescent probe based upon BIO 1211 (Biogen, Inc.), a selective VLA-4 antagonist (42Chen L.L. Whitty A. Lobb R.R. Adams S.P. Pepinsky R.B. J. Biol.

This probe contains LDV, an acidic binding motif, which mimics the prototype LDV ligand within the type III connecting segment of fibronectin and VCAM-1 that employs related, IDS motif sequence (21Humphries J.D.

We proposed to use it as an LFA-1-specific probe (Fig. 1A). A non-fluorescent analog was used to determine the nonspecific binding of the probe (Fig. 1B).

The evidence that the probe binds to the ICAM-1 binding site is further addressed and substantiated below. Binding of ligands to LFA-1 requires activation. We were unable to detect any real-time specific binding of the probe in the regular buffer containing 1.5 mm Ca2+ plus 1 mm Mg2+ or RPMI medium for up to ∼700–800 s and concentrations up to ∼200 nm (data not shown). This was not surprising because a high concentration of calcium ion is known to be inhibitory for several I-domain-containing integrins (19Shimaoka M. Takagi J. Springer T.A. Annu. Rev. Biophys.
