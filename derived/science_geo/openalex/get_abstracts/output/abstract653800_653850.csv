https://openalex.org/W3033271402,"Pneumonia is one of the most important causes of morbidity and mortality in children. Identification and characterization of pathogens that cause infections are crucial for accurate treatment and accelerated recovery. However, in most cases, the causative agent cannot be identified, which is partly due to the limited spectrum of pathogens covered by current diagnostics based on nucleic acid amplification. Therefore, in this study, we explored the application of metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) for the diagnosis of children with severe pneumonia. From April to July 2017, 32 hospitalized children with severe nonresponding pneumonia in Shenzhen Children’s Hospital were included in this study. Blood tests were conducted immediately after hospitalization to assess cell counts and inflammatory markers, oropharyngeal swabs were collected to identify common pathogens by qPCR and culture. After bronchoscopy, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) samples were collected for further pathogen identification using standardized diagnostic tests and mNGS. Blood tests were normal in 3 of the 32 children. In 9 oropharyngeal swabs, bacterial pathogens were detected, in 5 of these Mycoplasma pneumoniae was detected. Adenovirus was detected in 5 BALF samples, using the Direct Immunofluorescence Assay (DFA). In 15 cases, no common pathogens were found in BALF samples, using the current standard diagnostic tests, while in all 32 BALFs, pathogens were identified using mNGS, including adenovirus, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, cytomegalovirus and bocavirus. This study shows that, with mNGS, the sensitivity of detection of the causative pathogens in children with severe nonresponding pneumonia is significantly improved. In addition, mNGS gives more strain specific information, helps to identify new pathogens and could potentially help to trace and control outbreaks. In this study, we have shown that it is possible to have the results within 24 hours, making the application of mNGS feasible for clinical diagnostics."
https://openalex.org/W3033261352,"Based on World Health Organization guidelines, Government of India recommended management of possible serious bacterial infection (PSBI) in young infants up to two months of age on an outpatient basis where referral is not feasible. We implemented the guideline in program setting to increase access to treatment with high treatment success and low resultant mortality.Implementation research was conducted in four rural blocks of Lucknow district in Uttar Pradesh, India. It included policy dialogues with the central and state government and district level officials. A Technical Support Unit was established. Thereafter, capacity building across all cadres of health workers in the implementation area was done for strengthening of home based newborn care (HBNC) program, skills enhancement for identification and management of PSBI, logistics management to ensure availability of necessary supplies, monitoring and evaluation as well as providing feedback. Data was collected by the research team.From June 2017 to February 2019 there were 24,448 live births in a population of 856106. We identified 1302 infants, aged 0-59 days, with any sign of PSBI leading to a coverage of 53% (1302/2445), assuming an incidence of 10%. However, in the establishment phase the coverage was 33%, while it was 85% in the implementation phase. Accredited social health activists (ASHAs) identified 81.2% (1058/1302) cases while rest were identified by families. ASHAs increased home visits within first 7 days of life in home based newborn care program from 74.3% (2781/3738) to 89.0% (3128/3513) and detection of cases of PSBI from 1.6% (45/2781) to 8.7% (275/3128) in the first and last quarter of the project, respectively. Of these 18.7% (244/1302) refused referral to government health system and 6.7% (88/1302) were treated in a hospital. Among cases of PSBI, there were 13.3% (173/1302) cases of fast breathing in young infant aged 7-59 days in whom referral was not needed. Of these 147 were treated by oral amoxicillin and 95.2% (140/147) were cured. Among those who needed referral, simplified treatment was given when referral was refused. There were 2.9% (37/1302) cases of fast breathing at ages of 0-6 days of which 34 were treated by simplified treatment with100% (34/34) cured;66.5% (866/1302) were cases of clinical severe infection of which 685 treated by simplified treatment with94.2% (645/685)cured and 09 died;17.3% (226/1302) cases of critical illness of which 93 were treated by simplified treatment, as a last resort, 72% (67/93) cured and 16 died. Among 255 cases who either did not seek formal treatment or sought it at private facilities, 96 died.Simplified treatment for PSBI is feasible in public program settings in northern India with good cure rates. It required system strengthening and supportive supervision."
https://openalex.org/W3033056393,"Deficits in fast-spiking inhibitory interneurons (FSINs) within the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) are hypothesized to underlie cognitive impairment associated with schizophrenia. Though representing a minority of interneurons, this key cell type coordinates broad neural network gamma-frequency oscillations, associated with cognition and cognitive flexibility. Here we report expression of GluN2D mRNA selectively in parvalbumin positive cells of human postmortem dlPFC tissue, but not pyramidal neurons, with little to no GluN2C expression in either cell type. In acute murine mPFC slices the GluN2C/D selective positive allosteric modulator (PAM), CIQ(+), increased the intrinsic excitability as well as enhanced NMDAR-mediated EPSCs onto FSINs. This increase in intrinsic excitability with GluN2C/D PAM was also observed in the Dlx 5/6+/- FSIN developmental deficit model with reported FSIN hypoexcitability. Together these data speak to selective modulation of FSINs by a GluN2D PAM, providing a potential mechanism to counter the FSIN-deficit seen in schizophrenia."
https://openalex.org/W3033173266,"Schizophrenia is a condition that places a significant burden on individuals with the condition, their family, and society. A large proportion of those treated for schizophrenia do not experience treatment response and are referred to as having ""treatment-resistant schizophrenia"" (TRS). Expert opinion has long held that the prevalence of TRS among individuals with schizophrenia is 30%, but the basis of this estimate is unclear. This article presents a model developed for estimating the prevalence of TRS in the United States 2014.An incidence-prevalence-mortality model was developed to estimate the prevalence of TRS in the United States. The model was populated with data from public health agencies and published literature. Prevalence in 2014 was modelled using a Markov cohort simulation for each birth cohort between 1930 to 2014.Using different scenarios for baseline incidence, relative risks of mortality, it was estimated that approximately 22% of individuals with schizophrenia would be considered treatment-resistant in 2014.The results suggests that prevalence of TRS may be somewhat lower than the 30% often reported, however this is highly dependent on the definition of treatment resistance. Methods such as this may help answer epidemiological and health policy questions as well as test the influence of key underlying assumptions."
https://openalex.org/W3033612340,"Introduction Electronic Health Records are receiving considerable attention as a valuable tool for managing clinical information. Despite the prospects of Electronic Health Records in developing countries, many pre-implementation assessments target organizational, managerial, and infrastructural readiness, but barely include a detailed examination of health provider readiness. Meanwhile, health provider readiness is a critical success factor for electronic health records in settings where the majority of the workforce is less likely to have basic computer skills. We sought to assess the readiness of health providers for electronic health records in Ghana. Materials and method An institutional-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 350 health providers in northern Ghana from June-September 2019. Data were collected using a modified questionnaire on provider readiness. The mean overall readiness was calculated for each respondent. Providers with readiness score below the overall mean score were categorized as not being ready while those at or above the mean score were considered ready. Multiple linear regression was conducted to determine the factors that determine provider readiness. Results Two hundred and nine health providers responded to the questionnaire (59.7 response rate). The mean overall readiness was 3.61 (SD = .76), mean core readiness was 3.74 (SD = .80), and mean engagement readiness was 3.47 (SD = .67). Using the average overall readiness score as the cut-off for determining being ready and not ready for electronic health records, overall readiness was 54.9%, core readiness was 67.2%, while engagement readiness was 43.1%. Age, sex, old employees compared to new employees, computer literacy, and knowledge of electronic health records were significant determinants of health providers’ readiness to adopt electronic health records. Conclusion We observed that health providers were marginally ready for electronic health records adoption. While participants might have expressed dissatisfaction with paper-based records and expressed a desire for electronic health records, they expressed fear of the potential impact of computerized records. We proposed a robust informatics curriculum and capacity building workshops for improving provider readiness for electronic health records."
https://openalex.org/W3033254109,"The B7 family represents one of the best-studied subgroups within the Ig superfamily, yet new interactions continue to be discovered. However, this binding promiscuity represents a major challenge for defining the biological contribution of each specific interaction. We developed a strategy for addressing these challenges by combining cell microarray and high-throughput FACS methods to screen for promiscuous binding events, map binding interfaces, and generate functionally selective reagents. Applying this approach to the interactions of mPD-L1 with its receptor mPD-1 and its ligand mB7-1, we identified the binding interface of mB7-1 on mPD-L1 and as a result generated mPD-L1 mutants with binding selectivity for mB7-1 or mPD-1. Next, using a panel of mB7-1 mutants, we mapped the binding sites of mCTLA-4, mCD28 and mPD-L1. Surprisingly, the mPD-L1 binding site mapped to the dimer interface surface of mB7-1, placing it distal from the CTLA-4/CD28 recognition surface. Using two independent approaches, we demonstrated that mPD-L1 and mB7-1 bind in cis, consistent with recent reports from Chaudhri A et al. and Sugiura D et al. We further provide evidence that while CTLA-4 and CD28 do not directly compete with PD-L1 for binding to B7-1, they can disrupt the cis PD-L1:B7-1 complex by reorganizing B7-1 on the cell surface. These observations offer new functional insights into the regulatory mechanisms associated with this group of B7 family proteins and provide new tools to elucidate their function in vitro and in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W3033432866,"The opioid epidemic has led to an increase in the number of persons who inject drugs, and this population accounts for 12% of new human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and 60% of new hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections in the United States annually. While persons who inject drugs disproportionately utilize the emergency department (ED), accurate data is lacking on the prevalence and patterns of injection drug use, and prevalence of co-occurring HIV and HCV infections among ED patients.The primary outcome was to assess the prevalence of injection drug use and co-occurring HIV and HCV infection among patients presenting to an urban ED.This was a cross sectional study conducted at an urban ED, with an annual census of 65,000 visits. A closed-response questionnaire was developed based on publicly available validated surveys to assess patterns of injection drug use and HIV and HCV infection status, and administered by trained research assistants to all registered adult patients during 4-hour blocks of time.Of the 2,319 eligible patients, 2,200 (94.9%) consented and completed the survey. 241 (11.0%) had ever used injection drugs, 103 (4.7%) currently used injection drugs, and 138 (6.3%) formerly used injection drugs. White patients age 25 to 34 years and white patients age 55 to 64 years had the highest prevalence of current (25.6%) and former (27.1%) injection drug use, respectively. Persons who use injection drugs had a higher prevalence of HCV infection (52.7% vs. 3.4%) and HIV infection (6.2% vs. 1.8%) than the rest of the population.A high prevalence of ED patients report injection drug use, and this population self-reports a high prevalence of HIV and HCV infection. Emergency departments are in a unique position to engage with this population with regards to substance use treatment and linkage to care for HIV and HCV infection."
https://openalex.org/W3033187431,"Managing pests in carrot production is challenging. Endophytic microbes have been demonstrated to improve the health and productivity of many crops, but factors affecting endophyte dynamics in carrot is still not well understood. The goal of this study was to determine how crop management system and carrot genotype interact to affect the composition and potential of endophytes to mitigate disease caused by Alternaria dauci, an important carrot pathogen. Twenty-eight unique isolates were collected from the taproots of nine diverse genotypes of carrot grown in a long-term trial comparing organic and conventional management. Antagonistic activity was quantified using an in vitro assay, and potential for individual isolates to mitigate disease was evaluated in greenhouse trials using two carrot cultivars. Results confirm that carrot taproots are colonized by an abundant and diverse assortment of bacteria and fungi representing at least distinct 13 genera. Soils in the organic system had greater total organic matter, microbial biomass and activity than the conventional system and endophyte composition in taproots grown in this system were more abundant and diverse, and had greater antagonistic activity. Carrot genotype also affected endophyte abundance as well as potential for individual isolates to affect seed germination, seedling growth and tolerance to A. dauci. The benefits of endophytes on carrot growth were greatest when plants were subject to A. dauci stress, highlighting the importance of environmental conditions in the functional role of endophytes. Results of this study provide evidence that endophytes can play an important role in improving carrot performance and mediating resistance to A. dauci, and it may someday be possible to select for these beneficial plant-microbial relationships in carrot breeding programs. Implementing soil-building practices commonly used in organic farming systems has potential to promote these beneficial relationships and improve the health and productivity of carrot crops."
https://openalex.org/W3033918992,"Background Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is posing a major public health challenge globally. Evidence reports significant gaps in knowledge of cardiovascular risk factors among patients with CVD. Despite the growing burden of cardiovascular disease in developing countries, there is limited data available to improve the awareness of this area, which is crucial for the implementation of prevention programs. Methods A cross-sectional survey was conducted in two referral hospitals in Eastern Ethiopia from June-September 2018. Outpatients with a confirmed diagnosis cardiovascular conditions were eligible for participation in the study. A convenience sampling technique was used. The primary outcome of the study was knowledge of cardiovascular risk factors among patients with cardiovascular disease. The knowledge of cardiovascular disease risk factors was measured using a validated instrument (heart disease fact questionnaire). A score less than 70% was defined as suboptimal knowledge. Multivariable linear regression was used to examine the relationship between knowledge of cardiovascular risk factors and explanatory variables. Results A total of 287 patients were enrolled in the study. Mean age was 47±11yrs and 56.4% of patients were females. More than half of patients (54%) had good knowledge on cardiovascular risk factors (scored>70%), whilst 46% demonstrated suboptimal knowledge levels in this area. Urban residency was associated with higher cardiovascular risk factors knowledge scores, whereas, never married and no formal education or lower education were identified as predictors of lower knowledge scores. There was no statistically significant association between knowledge of cardiovascular risk factors and actual cumulative risk behaviour. Conclusion Almost half of CVD patients in Ethiopia have suboptimal knowledge regarding cardiovascular risk factors. Residence, education level and marital status were associated with knowledge of cardiovascular risk factors. Implementation of innovative interventions and structured, nurse-led lifestyle counselling would be required to effectively guide patients in developing lifestyle modification and achieve sustainable behaviour change."
https://openalex.org/W3033202577,"Mines and caves are unusual ecosystems containing unique fungi and are greatly understudied compared to other environments. The Soudan Mine in Tower, MN, an iron ore mine that closed in 1963 after operating for 80 years, was sampled to explore fungal diversity and to investigate taxa that tolerate heavy metals for potential bioprocessing technologies or as sources of bioactive molecules for drug discovery and possible biocontrol for white-nose syndrome (WNS) of bats. The mine is 714 m deep, has 18 levels and contains large quantities of wooden timbers, in contrast to many other oligotrophic subterranean environments. Fungi were cultured from samples and the ITS region was sequenced for identification and phylogenetic analysis. Results show Ascomycota are the dominant fungi followed by Basidiomycota and Mucoromycota. Out of 164 identified taxa, 108 belong to the Ascomycota and 26 and 31 to Basidiomycota and Mucoromycota, respectively. There are also 46 taxa that do not match (<97% BLAST GenBank identity) sequenced fungal species. Examples of the most commonly isolated Ascomycota include Scytalidium sp., Mariannaea comptospora, Hypocrea pachybasidioides, Oidiodendron griseum and Pochonia bulbillosa; Basidiomycota include Postia sp., Sistotrema brinkmannii, Calocera sp., Amylocorticiellum sp.; Mucoromycota include Mortierella parvispora, M. gamsii, M. hyaline, M. basiparvispora and Mortierella sp. Unusual growth forms were also found including large quantities of black rhizomorphs of Armillaria sinapina and white mycelial cords of Postia sp. mycelium, as well as Pseudogymnoascus species growing over large areas of mine walls and ceiling. The mine environment is a relatively extreme environment for fungi, with the presence of high levels of heavy metals, complete darkness and poor nutrient availability. Several genera are similar to those isolated in other extreme environments but phylogenetic analyses show differences in species between these environments. Results indicate this subterranean environment hosts a wide diversity of fungi, many of them not found in above ground environments."
https://openalex.org/W3033765035,"Background Peripheral blood transcriptome profiling is a potentially important tool for disease detection. We utilize this technique in a case-control study to identify candidate transcriptomic biomarkers able to differentiate women with breast lesions from normal controls. Methods Whole blood samples were collected from 50 women with high-risk breast lesions, 57 with breast cancers and 44 controls (151 samples). Blood gene expression profiling was carried out using microarray hybridization. We identified blood gene expression signatures using AdaBoost, and constructed a predictive model differentiating breast lesions from controls. Model performance was then characterized by AUC sensitivity, specificity and accuracy. Biomarker biological processes and functions were analyzed for clues to the pathogenesis of breast lesions. Results Ten gene biomarkers were identified (YWHAQ, BCLAF1, WSB1, PBX2, DDIT4, LUC7L3, FKBP1A, APP, HERC2P2, FAM126B). A ten-gene panel predictive model showed discriminatory power in the test set (sensitivity: 100%, specificity: 84.2%, accuracy: 93.5%, AUC: 0.99). These biomarkers were involved in apoptosis, TGF-beta signaling, adaptive immune system regulation, gene transcription and post-transcriptional protein modification. Conclusion A promising method for the detection of breast lesions is reported. This study also sheds light on breast cancer/immune system interactions, providing clues to new targets for breast cancer immune therapy."
https://openalex.org/W3033197244,"Adequate resources are required to rapidly diagnose and treat pediatric musculoskeletal infection (MSKI). The workload MSKI consults contribute to pediatric orthopaedic services is unknown as prior epidemiologic studies are variable and negative work-ups are not included in national discharge databases. The hypothesis was tested that MSKI consults constitute a substantial volume of total consultations for pediatric orthopaedic services across the United States.Eighteen institutions from the Children's ORthopaedic Trauma and Infection Consortium for Evidence-based Study (CORTICES) group retrospectively reviewed a minimum of 1 year of hospital data, reporting the total number of surgeons, total consultations, and MSKI-related consultations. Consultations were classified by the location of consultation (emergency department or inpatient). Culture positivity rate and pathogens were also reported.87,449 total orthopaedic consultations and 7,814 MSKI-related consultations performed by 229 pediatric orthopaedic surgeons were reviewed. There was an average of 13 orthopaedic surgeons per site each performing an average of 154 consultations per year. On average, 9% of consultations were MSKI related and 37% of these consults yielded positive cultures. Finally, a weak inverse monotonic relationship was noted between percent culture positivity and percent of total orthopedic consults for MSKI.At large, academic pediatric tertiary care centers, pediatric orthopaedic services consult on an average of ~3,000 'rule-out' MSKI cases annually. These patients account for nearly 1 in 10 orthopaedic consultations, of which 1 in 3 are culture positive. Considering that 2 in 3 consultations were culture negative, estimating resources required for pediatric orthopaedic consult services to work up and treat children based on culture positive administrative discharge data underestimates clinical need. Finally, ascertainment bias must be considered when comparing differences in culture rates from different institution's pediatric orthopaedics services, given the variability in when orthopaedic physicians become involved in a MSKI workup."
https://openalex.org/W3033758522,"We investigate factors affecting individual investors' switching intention from traditional financial market to crypto-currency financial market. By sampling factors of individual investors related with crypto-currency (CC), the study applies structural equation modeling method (SEM) to investigate their effects on switching intention by integrating PPM and Reinforcement Sensitivity theories (RST) to form a pulling, pushing and mooring effects model. The investigation indicates that crypto-currency market can be regarded as a kind of beneficial supplement of tradition investment market for those individual investors who are with high innovativeness, reward sensitivity, knowledge and perceived risk. This study proves that the individual investors are not only attracted by significant expected return from crypto-currency but also relevant knowledge and risks disclosed by crypto-currency market regulators and distributors. The findings reinforce major roles for both market regulators and individual investors in considering and providing insights for future policy, management and investigations."
https://openalex.org/W3033066322,"Captive breeding programs for endangered species can increase population numbers for eventual reintroduction to the wild. Captive populations are typically small and isolated, which results in inbreeding and reduction of genetic variability, and may lead to an increased risk of extinction. The Omkoi Wildlife Breeding Center maintains the only Thai captive Chinese goral (Naemorhedus griseus) population, and has plans to reintroduce individuals into natural isolated populations. Genetic variability was assessed within the captive population using microsatellite data. Although no bottleneck was observed, genetic variability was low (allelic richness = 7.091 ± 0.756, He = 0.455 ± 0.219; He < Ho) and 11 microsatellite loci were informative that likely reflect inbreeding. Estimates of small effective population size and limited numbers of founders, combined with wild-born individuals within subpopulations, tend to cause reduction of genetic variability over time in captive programs. This leads to low reproductive fitness and limited ability to adapt to environmental change, thereby increasing the risk of extinction. Management of captive populations as evolutionarily significant units with diverse genetic backgrounds offers an effective strategy for population recovery. Relocation of individuals among subpopulations, or introduction of newly captured wild individuals into the captive program will help to ensure the future security of Chinese goral. Implications for future conservation actions for the species are discussed herein."
https://openalex.org/W3032985406,"Several studies suggest the relation of DNA methylation to diseases in humans and important phenotypes in plants drawing attention to this epigenetic mark as an important source of variability. In the last decades, several methodologies were developed to assess the methylation state of a genome. However, there is still a lack of affordable and precise methods for genome wide analysis in large sample size studies. Methyl sensitive double digestion MS-DArT sequencing method emerges as a promising alternative for methylation profiling. We developed a computational pipeline for the identification of DNA methylation using MS-DArT-seq data and carried out a pilot study using the Eucalyptus grandis tree sequenced for the species reference genome. Using a statistic framework as in differential expression analysis, 72,515 genomic sites were investigated and 5,846 methylated sites identified, several tissue specific, distributed along the species 11 chromosomes. We highlight a bias towards identification of DNA methylation in genic regions and the identification of 2,783 genes and 842 transposons containing methylated sites. Comparison with WGBS, DNA sequencing after treatment with bisulfite, data demonstrated a precision rate higher than 95% for our approach. The availability of a reference genome is useful for determining the genomic context of methylated sites but not imperative, making this approach suitable for any species. Our approach provides a cost effective, broad and reliable examination of DNA methylation profile on MspI/HpaII restriction sites, is fully reproducible and the source code is available on GitHub (https://github.com/wendelljpereira/ms-dart-seq)."
https://openalex.org/W3033218561,"Cigarette smoking is among the leading risk factors for mortality and morbidity. While men have a higher smoking prevalence, mechanistic experiments suggest that women are at higher risk for health problems due to smoking. Moreover, the comparison of smoking effects on multiple conditions and mortality for men and women has not yet been done in a population-based group with race/ethnic diversity. We used proportional hazards models and restricted mean survival time to assess differences in smoking effects by sex for multiple health outcomes using data from the U.S. Health and Retirement Study (HRS), a population-representative cohort of individuals aged 50+ (n = 22,708, 1992–2014). Men had experienced more smoking pack-years than women (22.0 vs 15.6 average pack-years). Age of death, onset of lung disorders, heart disease, stroke, and cancer showed dose-dependent effects of smoking for both sexes. Among heavy smokers (>28 pack-years) women had higher risk of earlier age of death (HR = 1.3, 95%CI:1.03–1.65) and stroke (HR = 1.37, 95%CI:1.02–1.83). Risk of cancer and heart disease did not differ by sex for smokers. Women had earlier age of onset for lung disorders (HR = 2.83, 95%CI:1.74–4.6), but men risk due to smoking were higher (Smoking-Sex interaction P<0.02) than women. Passive smoke exposure increased risk of earlier heart disease (HR = 1.33, 95%CI:1.07–1.65) and stroke (HR:1.54, 95%CI:1.07–2.22) for non-smokers, mainly in men. Smoking cessation after 15 years partially attenuated the deleterious smoking effects for all health outcomes. In sum, our results suggest that women are more vulnerable to ever smoking for earlier death and risk of stroke, but less vulnerable for lung disorders. From an epidemiological perspective, sex differences in smoking effects are important considerations that could underlie sex differences in health outcomes. These findings also encourage future mechanistic experiments to resolve potential mechanisms of sex-specific cigarette smoke toxicity."
https://openalex.org/W3034040558,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), which is associated with an absence of obvious symptoms and poor prognosis, is the second leading cause of cancer death worldwide. Genome-wide molecular biology studies should provide biological insights into HCC development. Based on the importance of phosphorylation for signal transduction, several protein kinase inhibitors have been developed that improve the survival of cancer patients. However, a comprehensive database of HCC-related phosphorylated biomarkers (HCCPMs) and novel HCCPMs prediction platform has been lacking. We have thus constructed the dBMHCC databases to provide expression profiles, phosphorylation and drug information, and evidence type; gathered information on HCC-related pathways and their involved genes as candidate HCC biomarkers; and established a system for evaluating protein phosphorylation and HCC-related biomarkers to improve the reliability of biomarker prediction. The resulting dBMHCC contains 611 notable HCC-related genes, 234 HCC-related pathways, 17 phosphorylation-related motifs and their 255 corresponding protein kinases, 5955 HCC biomarkers, and 1077 predicted HCCPMs. Methionine adenosyltransferase 2B (MAT2B) and acireductone dioxygenase 1 (ADI1), which regulate HCC development and hepatitis C virus infection, respectively, were among the top 10 HCCPMs predicted by dBMHCC. Platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRA), which had the highest evaluation score, was identified as the target of one HCC drug (Regorafenib), five cancer drugs, and four non-cancer drugs. dBMHCC is an open resource for HCC phosphorylated biomarkers, which supports researchers investigating the development of HCC and designing novel diagnosis methods and drug treatments.

https://openalex.org/W3033256924,"The risk of dying increases exponentially with age, in humans as well as in many other species. This increase is often attributed to the “accumulation of damage” known to occur in many biological structures and systems. The aim of this paper is to describe a generic model of damage accumulation and death in which mortality increases exponentially with age. The damage-accumulation process is modeled by a stochastic process know as a queue, and risk of dying is a function of the accumulated damage, i.e., length of the queue. The model has four parameters and the main characteristics of the model are: (i) damage occurs at random times with a constant high rate; (ii) the damage is repaired at a limited rate, and consequently damage can accumulate; (iii) the efficiency of the repair mechanism decays linearly with age; (iv) the risk of dying is a function of the accumulated damage. Using standard results from the mathematical theory of queues it is shown that there is an exponential dependence between risk of dying and age in these models, and that this dependency holds irrespective of how the damage-accumulation process is modeled. Furthermore, the ways in which this exponential dependence is shaped by the model parameters are also independent of the details of the damage accumulation process. These generic features suggest that the model could be useful when interpreting changes in the relation between age and mortality in real data. To exemplify, historical mortality data from Sweden are interpreted in the light of the model. The decrease in mortality seen between cohorts born in 1905, compared to those born in 1885, can be accounted for by higher threshold to damage. This fits well with the many advances made in public health during the 20th century."
https://openalex.org/W3033073571,"Schizophrenia is a debilitating disorder affecting just under 1% of the population. While the symptoms of this disorder do not appear until late adolescence, pathological alterations likely occur earlier, during development in utero. While there is an increasing literature examining transcriptome alterations in patients, it is not possible to examine the changes in gene expression that occur during development in humans that will develop schizophrenia. Here we utilize three distinct rodent developmental disruption models of schizophrenia to examine potential overlapping alterations in the transcriptome, with a specific focus on markers of interneuron development. Specifically, we administered either methylazoxymethanol acetate (MAM), Polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (Poly I:C), or chronic protein malnutrition, on GD 17 and examined mRNA expression in the developing hippocampus of the offspring 18 hours later. Here, we report alterations in gene expression that may contribute to the pathophysiology of schizophrenia, including significant alterations in interneuron development and ribosome function."
https://openalex.org/W3033251231,"Better triage tests for screening tuberculosis (TB) disease are needed for people living with HIV (PLHIV). We performed the first evaluation of a previously-validated 8-antigen serological panel to screen PLHIV for pulmonary TB in Kampala, Uganda. We selected a random 1:1 sample with and without TB (defined by sputum culture) from a cohort of PLHIV initiating antiretroviral therapy. We used a multiplex microbead immunoassay and an ensemble machine learning classifier to determine the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for Ag85A, Ag85B, Ag85C, Rv0934-P38, Rv3881, Rv3841-BfrB, Rv3873, and Rv2878c. We then assessed the performance with the addition of four TB-specific antigens ESAT-6, CFP-10, Rv1980-MPT64, and Rv2031-HSPX, and every antigen combination. Of 262 participants (median CD4 cell-count 152 cells/μL [IQR 65–279]), 138 (53%) had culture-confirmed TB. The 8-antigen panel had an AUC of 0.53 (95% CI 0.40–0.66), and the additional 4 antigens did not improve performance (AUC 0.51, 95% CI 0.39–0.64). When sensitivity was restricted to ≥90% for the 8- and 12-antigen panel, specificity was 2.2% (95% CI 0–17.7%) and 8.1% (95% CI 0–23.9%), respectively. A three-antigen combination (Rv0934-P38, Ag85A, and Rv2031-HSPX) outperformed both panels, with an AUC of 0.60 (95% CI 0.48–0.73), 90% sensitivity (95% CI 78.2–96.7%) and 29.7% specificity (95% CI 15.9–47%). The multi-antigen panels did not achieve the target accuracy for a TB triage test among PLHIV. We identified a new combination that improved performance for TB screening in an HIV-positive sample compared to an existing serological panel in Uganda, and suggests an approach to identify novel antigen combinations specifically for screening TB in PLHIV."
https://openalex.org/W3033592629,"Background Warfarin is an anticoagulant medication proven effective in the initial treatment and secondary prevention of venous thromboembolism. Anti-Xa direct oral anticoagulants are alternatives to warfarin; however there is limited data assessing satisfaction after switching from warfarin to an anti-Xa direct oral anticoagulant in patients for treatment of venous thromboembolism. Objectives To assess medication satisfaction in patients requiring anticoagulation for venous thromboembolism after conversion from warfarin to an anti-Xa direct oral anticoagulant. Methods A retrospective cohort study with prospective assessment of satisfaction and review of adverse events following anti-Xa direct oral anticoagulant replacement of warfarin for treatment of venous thromboembolism. Out of 165 patients who had switched from warfarin to rivaroxaban or apixaban from an outpatient haematology practice, 126 patients consented for a survey of patient’s relative satisfaction of anti-Xa direct oral anticoagulant therapy compared with previous warfarin therapy using the Anti-Clot Burden and Benefits Treatment Scale and SWAN Score. Results The mean Anti-Clot Burden and Benefits and SWAN Score was 93% (56/60) and 83% (24.8/30) respectively reflecting high satisfaction with anti-Xa direct oral anticoagulants. 120 patients stated preference for anti-Xa direct oral anticoagulants over warfarin. Leading perceptions driving this was the reduction in frequency of medical contact and fewer bleeding side effects. Thirteen patients (10.3%) experienced an adverse event after the anti-Xa direct oral anticoagulant switch (majority were non-major bleeding) but most remained on anti-Xa direct oral anticoagulant treatment after management options were implemented with continued high satisfaction scores. Conclusions Patient satisfaction with anti-Xa direct oral anticoagulant therapy for the treatment and prevention of venous thromboembolism after switching from warfarin in routine clinical practice appeared high. Improved patient convenience including reduced frequency of medical contact and fewer unpredictable side effects were perceived as significant advantages of anti-Xa direct oral anticoagulants compared to warfarin."
https://openalex.org/W3033678880,"The Women's March of 2017 generated unprecedented levels of participation in the largest, single day, protest in history to date. The marchers protested the election of President Donald Trump and rallied in support of several civil issues such as women's rights. ""Sister marches"" evolved in at least 680 locations across the United States. Both positive and negative reactions to the March found their way into social media, with criticism stemming from certain, conservative, political sources and other groups. In this study, we investigate the extent to which this notable, historic event influenced sentiment on Twitter, and the degree to which responses differed by geographic area within the continental U.S. Tweets about the event rose to an impressive peak of over 12% of all geo-located tweets by mid-day of the March, Jan. 21. Messages included in tweets associated with the March tended to be positive in sentiment, on average, with a mean of 0.34 and a median of 0.07 on a scale of -4 to +4. In fact, tweets associated with the March were more positive than all other geo-located tweets during the day of the March. Exceptions to this pattern of positive sentiment occurred only in seven metropolitan areas, most of which involved very small numbers of tweets. Little evidence surfaced of extensive patterns of negative, aggressive messages towards the event in this set of tweets. Given the widespread nature of online harassment and sexist tweets, more generally, the results are notable. In sum, online reactions to the March on this social media platform suggest that this modern arm of the Women's Movement received considerable, virtual support across the country."
https://openalex.org/W3033936964,"Purpose Decades of research have explored communication in cerebrovascular diseases by focusing on formulaic expressions (e.g., “Thank you”—“You’re welcome”). This category of utterances is known for engaging primarily right-hemisphere frontotemporal and bilateral subcortical neural networks, explaining why left-hemisphere stroke patients with speech-motor planning disorders often produce formulaic expressions comparatively well. The present proof-of-concept study aims to confirm that using verbal cues derived from formulaic expressions can alleviate word-onset difficulties, one major symptom in apraxia of speech. Methods In a cross-sectional repeated-measures design, 20 individuals with chronic post-stroke apraxia of speech were asked to produce (i) verbal cues (e.g., /guː/) and (ii) subsequent German target words (e.g., “Tanz”) with critical onsets (e.g., /t/). Cues differed, most notably, in aspects of formulaicity (e.g., stereotyped prompt: /guː/, based on formulaic phrase “Guten Morgen”; unstereotyped prompt: /muː/, based on non-formulaic control word “Mutig”). Apart from systematic variation in stereotypy and communicative-pragmatic embeddedness possibly associated with holistic language processing, cues were matched for consonant-vowel structure, syllable-transition frequency, noun-verb classification, meter, and articulatory tempo. Results Statistical analyses revealed significant increases in correctly produced word onsets after verbal cues with distinct features of formulaicity (e.g., stereotyped versus unstereotyped prompts: p < 0.001), as reflected in large effect sizes (Cohen’s dz ≤ 2.2). Conclusions The current results indicate that using preserved formulaic language skills can relieve word-onset difficulties in apraxia of speech. This finding is consistent with a dynamic interplay of left perilesional and right intact language networks in post-stroke rehabilitation and may inspire new treatment strategies for individuals with apraxia of speech."
https://openalex.org/W3033098322,"Background Person and environment-related childhood adverse events have been demonstrated to increase the risk of impaired mental health in later life differently for boys and girls. Altered hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA)-axis functioning has been suggested as a key mechanism underlying this association. Cortisol and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) are both output hormones of the HPA-axis. DHEA may have a protective function against long-term exposure to increased levels of cortisol, but has been little investigated in relation to childhood adversity. Objective We aimed to test the associations between person-, and environment-related childhood adversity and levels of cortisol, DHEA and cortisol/DHEA ratio in adolescent boys and girls. Methods A total of 215 Dutch adolescents participated in the study and filled out the 27-item Adverse Life Events Questionnaire for the assessment of childhood adversity, which was split up in separate scores for person-related and environment-related events. Cortisol and DHEA concentrations and cortisol/DHEA ratio were determined in proximal 3 cm long hair segments. Additionally, saliva samples were collected immediately and 30 minutes after waking up, at noon and at 8 pm. Multiple linear regression analyses were used to test associations between childhood adversity and cortisol and DHEA concentrations, for boys and girls separately, with age, BMI and pubertal development as covariates. Results Data were available for 74 boys and 116 girls with a mean age of 15.7 years (SD = 2.0). Higher levels of person-related childhood adversity were associated with higher hair DHEA levels in girls and with higher hair cortisol levels in boys. A trend towards a significant association was observed between higher levels of environment-related childhood adversity and higher DHEA levels in boys. Neither person- nor environment related childhood adversity was associated with cortisol/DHEA ratio. A trend was observed for environment-related childhood adversity and lower daily cortisol output in boys. Conclusion We found differential associations between childhood adversity and cortisol and DHEA levels in girls and boys, for respectively person-related and environment-related childhood adversity. Our findings suggest that different types of childhood adversity are not only linked to levels of cortisol, but also to DHEA concentrations, in a sex-specific manner, with possible future implications for mental health."
https://openalex.org/W3033584664,"Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) is associated with decreased appetite. The ghrelin hormone is one of the major regulators of appetite.To evaluate appetite and ghrelin levels in patients with IDA, and to investigate the change in appetite and ghrelin following intravenous iron therapy.A total of 56 IDA patients and 51 controls were included in the study. Both appetite and ghrelin were assessed at baseline and following intravenous iron therapy. These were assessed at corresponding time intervals in the control group. Appetite was assessed by the SNAQ score (Simplified Nutritional Appetite Questionnaire) and fasting ghrelin levels were assessed by acylated ghrelin (AG), unacylated ghrelin (UAG) and their respective ratio AG/UAG.IDA patients had significantly lower SNAQ scores, yet higher AG levels and higher AG/UAG ratios compared to healthy controls; the mean SNAQ scores were 12.56 ± 3.45 and 16.1 ± 2, respectively (P<0.01); the median AG levels were 57.5 pg/ml and 43 pg/ml respectively (P = 0.007); and the median AG/UAG ratios were 0.48 and 0.25 respectively (P = 0.04). On multivariate linear regression analysis, IDA remained independently associated with decreased SNAQ score (β = -0.524, P<0.001) and increased acylated ghrelin (β = 0.289, P = 0.013). After IDA was treated, SNAQ scores increased significantly by a mean of 2 points. AG and AG/UAG ratios decreased significantly by a mean of -18.44 pg/ml and -0.2 respectively. The control group showed no significant change in SNAQ scores or ghrelin at corresponding time intervals.IDA patients have a reduced appetite and paradoxically elevated ghrelin hormone activity compared to healthy controls. Treating IDA enhances appetite and lowers ghrelin levels. Future studies are needed to explore the mechanism of this paradoxical ghrelin activity."
https://openalex.org/W3032956024,"About 50% of human cancers across the globe arise due to a mutation in the p53 gene which gives rise to its functional inactive form, and in the rest of the cancer the efficacy of active p53 (wild-type) is hindered by MDM2-mediated degradation. Breakdown of the p53-MDM2 association may constitute an effective strategy to stimulate or reinstate the activity of wild type p53, thereby reviving the p53 tumor suppressor capability. S100A1 has been revealed to associate with the N-terminal domain of MDM2 and p53 protein. We utilized NMR spectroscopy to study the interface amongst the S100A1 and N-terminal domain of MDM2. Additionally, the S100A1-MDM2 complex generated through the HADDOCK program was then superimposed with the p53 (peptide) -MDM2 complex reported earlier. The overlay indicated that a segment of S100A1 could block the interaction of p53 (peptide) -MDM2 complex significantly. To further justify our assumption, we performed HSQC-NMR titration for the S100A1 and p53 N-terminal domain (p53-TAD). The data obtained indicated that the S100A1 segment comprising nearly 17 residues have some common residues that interact with both MDM2 and p53-TAD. Further, we synthesized the 17-residue peptide derived from the S100A1 protein and attached it to the cell-penetrating HIV-TAT peptide. The HSQC-NMR competitive binding experiment revealed that Peptide 1 could successfully interfere with the p53-MDM2 interaction. Furthermore, functional effects of the peptide was validated in cancer cells. The results showed that Peptide 1 effectively inhibited cell proliferation, and increased the protein levels of p53 and its downstream p21 in MCF-7 cells. Treatment of Peptide 1 resulted in cell cycle arrest at G2/M phase, and also induced apoptotic cell death at higher concentration. Taken together, the results suggest that disruption of the interaction of p53 and MDM2 by Peptide 1 could activate normal p53 functions, leading to cell cycle arrest and apoptotic cell death in cancer cells. We proposed here that S100A1 could influence the p53-MDM2 interaction credibly and possibly reactivates the wild type p53 pathway."
https://openalex.org/W3033380330,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most lethal and malignant tumours worldwide. New therapeutic targets for HCC are urgently needed. CYCLOPS (copy number alterations yielding cancer liabilities owing to partial loss) genes have been noted to be associated with cancer-targeted therapies. Therefore, we intended to explore the effects of the CYCLOPS gene RBM17 on HCC oncogenesis to determine if it could be further used for targeted therapy.We collected data on 12 types of cancer from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) queries for comparison with adjacent non-tumour tissues. RBM17 expression levels, clinicopathological factors and survival times were analysed. RNAseq data were downloaded from the Encyclopaedia of DNA Elements database for molecular mechanism exploration. Two representative HCC cell models were built to observe the proliferation capacity of HCC cells when RBM17 expression was inhibited by shRBM17. Cell cycle progression and apoptosis were also examined to investigate the pathogenesis of RBM17.Based on 6,136 clinical samples, RBM17 was markedly overexpressed in most cancers, especially HCC. Moreover, data from 442 patients revealed that high RBM17 expression levels were related to a worse prognosis. Overexpression of RBM17 was related to the iCluster1 molecular subgroup, TNM stage, and histologic grade. Pathway analysis of RNAseq data suggested that RBM17 was involved in mitosis. Further investigation revealed that the proliferation rates of HepG2 (P = 0.003) and SMMC-7721 (P = 0.030) cells were significantly reduced when RBM17 was knocked down. In addition, RBM17 knockdown also arrested the progression of the cell cycle, causing cells to halt at the G2/M phase. Increased apoptosis rates were also found in vitro.These results suggest that RBM17 is a potential therapeutic target for HCC treatment."
https://openalex.org/W3033792429,"Oxidative stress and inflammation determine retinal ganglion cell degeneration, leading to retinal impairment and vision loss. Müller glial cells regulate retinal repair under injury, through gliosis. Meanwhile, reactive gliosis can turn in pathological effects, contributing to neurodegeneration. In the present study, we tested whether Cord Blood Serum (CBS), rich of growth factors, might improve the viability of Müller cells under in vitro damage. BDNF, NGF, TGF-α, GDNF and EGF levels were measured in CBS samples by Human Magnetic Luminex Assay. CBS effects were evaluated on rat (rMC-1) and human (MIO-M1) Müller cells, under H2O2 and IL-1β damage. Cells grown with FBS or CBS both at 5% were exposed to stress and analyzed in terms of cell viability, GFAP, IL-6 and TNF-α expression. CBS was also administrated after treatment with K252a, inhibitor of the neurotrophin receptor Trk. Cell viability of rMC-1 and MIO-M1 resulted significantly improved when pretreated with CBS and exposed to H2O2 and IL-1β, in comparison to the standard culture with FBS. Accordingly, the gliosis marker GFAP resulted down-regulated following CBS priming. In parallel, we observed a lower expression of the inflammatory mediators in rMC-1 (TNF-α) and MIO-M1 (IL-6, TNF- α), especially in presence of inflammatory damage. Trk inhibition through K252a administration impaired the effects of CBS under stress conditions on MIO-M1 and rMC-1 viability, not significantly different from FBS condition. CBS is enriched with neurotrophins and its administration to rMC-1 and MIO-M1 attenuates the cytotoxic effects of H2O2 and IL-1β. Moreover, the decrease of the main markers of gliosis and inflammation suggests a promising use of CBS for neuroprotection aims. This study is a preliminary basis that prompts future investigations to deeply explore and confirm the CBS potential."
https://openalex.org/W3034000163,"Radiation-induced heart disease presents a significant challenge in the event of an accidental radiation exposure as well as to cancer patients who receive acute doses of irradiation as part of radiation therapy. We utilized the spontaneously hypertensive Wistar-Kyoto rat model, previously shown to demonstrate drug-induced cardiomyopathy, to evaluate the acute and long-term effects of sub-lethal total body gamma irradiation at two, four, and fifty-two weeks. We further examined irreversible oxidative protein carbonylation in the heart immediately following irradiation in the normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rat. Both males and females sustained weight loss and anemic conditions compared to untreated controls over a one-year period as reflected by reduced body weight and low red blood cell count. Increased inflammation was detected by elevated IL-6 serum levels selectively in males at four weeks. Serum cardiac troponin T and I analyses revealed signs of cardiomyopathy at earlier timepoints, but high variability was observed, especially at one year. Echocardiography at two weeks following 5.0Gy treatment revealed a significant decrease in cardiac output in females and a significant decrease in both diastolic and systolic volumes in males. Following 10.0Gy irradiation in the normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rat, the heart tissue showed an increase in total protein oxidative carbonylation accompanied by DNA damage indicated by an increase in γ-H2AX. Using proteomic analyses, we identified several novel proteins which showed a marked difference in carbonylation including those of mitochondrial origin and most notably, cardiac troponin T, one of the key proteins involved in cardiomyocyte contractility. Overall, we present findings of acute oxidative protein damage, DNA damage, cardiac troponin T carbonylation, and long-term cardiomyopathy in the irradiated animals."
https://openalex.org/W3034044457,"Background In 2014, a whole-of-population and multi-faceted preterm birth prevention program was introduced in Western Australia with the single aim of safely lowering the rate of preterm birth. The program included new clinical guidelines, print and social media, and a dedicated new clinic. In the first full calendar year the rate of preterm birth fell by 7.6% and the reduction extended from the 28–31 week gestational age group upwards. Objective The objective of this study was to evaluate outcomes in greater depth and to also include the first three years of the program. Study design This was a prospective population-based cohort study of perinatal outcomes in singleton pregnancies before and after commencement of the program. Results There was a significant reduction in preterm birth in the tertiary center which extended from 28 weeks gestation onwards and was ongoing. In non-tertiary centers there was an initial reduction, but this was not sustained past the first year. The greatest reduction was observed in pregnancies classified at first attendance as low risk. No benefit was observed in the private sector, but a significant reduction was seen in the remote region of the Kimberley where the program was first launched and vaginal progesterone had been made free-of-charge. Conclusion Preterm birth rates can be safely reduced by a multi-faceted and whole-of-population program but the effectiveness requires continuing effort and will be greatest where the strategies are most targeted."
https://openalex.org/W3034141348,"Neuropeptides are secreted molecules that have conserved roles modulating many processes, including mood, reproduction, and feeding. Dysregulation of neuropeptide signaling is also implicated in neurological disorders such as epilepsy. However, much is unknown about the mechanisms regulating specific neuropeptides to mediate behavior. Here, we report that the expression levels of dozens of neuropeptides are up-regulated in response to circuit activity imbalance in C. elegans. acr-2 encodes a homolog of human nicotinic receptors, and functions in the cholinergic motoneurons. A hyperactive mutation, acr-2(gf), causes an activity imbalance in the motor circuit. We performed cell-type specific transcriptomic analysis and identified genes differentially expressed in acr-2(gf), compared to wild type. The most over-represented class of genes are neuropeptides, with insulin-like-peptides (ILPs) the most affected. Moreover, up-regulation of neuropeptides occurs in motoneurons, as well as sensory neurons. In particular, the induced expression of the ILP ins-29 occurs in the BAG neurons, which were previously shown to function in gas-sensing. We also show that this up-regulation of ins-29 in acr-2(gf) animals is activity-dependent. Our genetic and molecular analyses support cooperative effects for ILPs and other neuropeptides in promoting motor circuit activity in the acr-2(gf) background. Together, this data reveals that a major transcriptional response to motor circuit dysregulation is in up-regulation of multiple neuropeptides, and suggests that BAG sensory neurons can respond to intrinsic activity states to feedback on the motor circuit."
https://openalex.org/W3033012842,"Human primary hepatocytes (PHs) are critical to studying liver functions, drug metabolism and toxicity. PHs isolated from livers that are unacceptable for transplantation have limited expansion and culture viability in vitro, in addition to rapidly deteriorating enzymatic functions. The unsuitability of immortalized hepato-carcinoma cell lines for this function has prompted studies to develop hepatocyte-like cells from alternative sources like ESC, iPS, and other stem cell types using differentiation protocols. This study describes a novel technique to produce expandable and functional hepatocyte-like cells from the fusion of an immortalized human umbilical cord blood derived cell line (E12 MLPC) to normal human primary hepatocytes. Multi-lineage progenitor cells (MLPC) comprise a small subset of mesenchymal-like cells isolated from human umbilical cord blood. MLPC are distinguishable from other mesenchymal-like cells by their extended expansion capacity (up to 80 cell doublings before senescence) and the ability to be differentiated into cells representative of endo-, meso- and ectodermal origins. Transfection of MLPC with the gene for telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) resulted in clonal cell lines that were capable of differentiation to different cellular outcomes while maintaining their functional immortality. A methodology for the development of immortalized hepatocyte-like hybrid cells by the in vitro fusion of human MLPC with normal human primary hepatocytes is reported. The resultant hybrid cells exhibited homology with hepatocytes by morphology, immunohistochemistry, urea and albumin production and gene expression. A medium that allows stable long-term expansion of hepatocyte-like fusion cells is described."
https://openalex.org/W3033065541,"Fluoroquinolone resistance in Salmonella Typhimurium is becoming a major concern. Hence, an intervention to limit the growth in resistance is inevitable. One way to combat this challenge is through combination therapy. The combination of antibiotics with phytochemicals has become an ideal means of preventing antimicrobial resistance. Recently, in an in vitro study, the combination of methyl gallate (MG) with marbofloxacin (MAR) has shown to prevent Salmonella Typhimurium invasion. It is also worth to study the effects of plant extracts on the pharmacokinetics of antibiotics. Hence, the objective of this study was to determine the effect of MG on the pharmacokinetics of MAR and pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics integration of MG and MAR. The micro-broth dilution method was used to obtain the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), and fractional inhibitory concentration (FIC) of MAR and MG. Whereas, the pharmacokinetic was conducted in rats by administering either MAR alone or combined with MG through oral and/or intravenous routes. The results indicated that the MIC of MAR and MG against standard strain Salmonella Typhimurium (ATCC 14028) was 0.031 and 500 μg/mL, respectively. The FICindex of the combination of MAR and MG was 0.5. For orally administered drugs, the Cmax and AUC24h of MAR were 1.04 and 0.78 μg/mL and 5.98 and 6.11 h.μg/mL when MAR was given alone and in combination with MG, respectively. The intravenous administration of MAR showed a half-life of 3.8 and 3.9 h; a clearance rate of 1.1 and 0.73 L/h/kg and a volume of distribution of 5.98 and 4.13 L/kg for MAR alone and in combination with MG, respectively. The AUC24/MIC for MAR alone and in combination with MG was 192.8 and 381.9 h, respectively. In conclusion, MG has shown to increase the antimicrobial activity of MAR in vitro and ex vivo experiments without affecting the pharmacokinetics of MAR in rats."

The aims were to examine and describe predictors associated with TB related mortality.Patients notified with TB from 2009 though 2014 in Denmark were included. Data were extracted from national registers and patient records were examined for clinical information and treatment outcome. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to examine TB related mortality.A total of 2131 cases were identified, 141 (6.6%) patients died before or during TB treatment. TB related mortality accounted for 104 cases (73.8%) and decreased significantly from 6.7% to 3.2% (p = .04) during the study period. Within 1 months of diagnosis, 49% of TB related deaths had occurred. The strongest risk factors present at time of diagnosis, associated with TB related mortality, were: age > 70 years, Charlson comorbidity index > 1, alcohol abuse, weight loss, anemia, and C-reactive protein > 100 mg/L (p < .05).The majority of TB related deaths occurred soon after diagnosis, emphasizing that TB patients identified to have a high risk of mortality should be closely monitored before and during the intensive treatment period to improve their outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W3034011734,"Background Measures to effectively expand tracing and testing to identify undiagnosed HIV infections are significant for the control of HIV/AIDS epidemic among men who have sex with men (MSM). We piloted a choice-based tracing and testing package aimed at improving partner tracing, uptake, and yield of HIV testing for sexual partners of newly diagnosed HIV-positive MSM. Methods This package was piloted in the cities of Hangzhou and Ningbo, Zhejiang province, China from June 2014 to June 2016. The package adopted four modes: couples’ HIV counseling and testing (CHCT), information assisted partner notification (IAPN), assisted HIV self-testing (HIVST) and patient referral. Data regarding sociodemographic factors and sexual behaviors between HIV-positive MSM and their sexual partners, as well as tracing and testing outcomes of each mode, were collected. Results Among 2,495 newly diagnosed HIV-positive MSM, 446(18%) were enrolled as index cases (ICs) through two rounds of contact tracing. The ICs disclosed a total of 4,716 sexual partners, of whom 548 (12%) were reachable. The pilot study resulted in a testing uptake of 87% (478/548), and a yield of 16% (74/478) among sexual partners. The generalized linear mixed model showed that the odds of a reachable sexual partner enrolled via IAPN taking an HIV test were 290% greater than that of a partner traced via CHCT (95% CI: 1.6, 9.3). Conclusions A choice-based tracing and testing package can feasibly expand HIV testing uptake and case finding among sexual partners of HIV-positive MSM. IAPN may be an acceptable option to reach sexual partners for whom limited contact information is available."
https://openalex.org/W3034055129,"We aimed to examine aneurysm hemodynamics with intra-saccular pressure measurement, and compare the effects of coiling, stenting and stent-assisted coiling in proximal segments of intracranial circulation. A cohort of 45 patients underwent elective endovascular coil embolization (with or without stent) for intracranial aneurysm at our department. Arterial pressure transducer was used for all measurements. It was attached to proximal end of the microcatheter. Measurements were taken in the parent artery before and after embolization, at the aneurysm dome before embolization, after stent implantation, and after embolization. Stent-assisted coiling was performed with 4 different stents: LVIS and LVIS Jr (Microvention, Tustin, CA, USA), Leo (Balt, Montmorency, France), Barrel VRD (Medtronic/ Covidien, Irvine, CA, USA). Presence of the stent showed significant reverse correlation with intra-aneurysmal pressure–both systolic and diastolic—after its implantation (r = -0.70 and r = -0.75, respectively), which was further supported by correlations with stent cell size–r = 0.72 and r = 0.71, respectively (P<0.05). Stent implantation resulted in significant decrease in diastolic intra-aneurysmal pressure (p = 0.046). Systolic or mean intra-aneurysmal pressure did not differ significantly. Embolization did not significantly change the intra-aneurysmal pressure in matched pairs, regardless of the use of stent (p>0.05). In conclusion, low-profile braided stents show a potential to divert blood flow, there was significant decrease in diastolic pressure after stent placement. Flow-diverting properties were related to stent porosity. Coiling does not significantly change the intra-aneurysmal pressure, regardless of packing density."
https://openalex.org/W3032920171,"The misfolding and aggregation of proteins is often implicated in the development and progression of degenerative diseases. Heat shock proteins (HSPs), such as the ubiquitously expressed Type II Hsp40 molecular chaperone, DNAJB6, assist in protein folding and disaggregation. Historically, mutations within the DNAJB6 G/F domain have been associated with Limb-Girdle Muscular Dystrophy type 1D, now referred to as LGMDD1, a dominantly inherited degenerative disease. Recently, novel mutations within the J domain of DNAJB6 have been reported in patients with LGMDD1. Since novel myopathy-causing mutations in the Hsp40 J domain have yet to be characterized and both the function of DNAJB6 in skeletal muscle and the clients of this chaperone are unknown, we set out to assess the effect of these mutations on chaperone function using the genetically tractable yeast system. The essential yeast Type II Hsp40, Sis1, is homologous to DNAJB6 and is involved in the propagation of yeast prions. Using phenotypic, biochemical, and functional assays we found that homologous mutations in the Sis1 J domain differentially alter the processing of specific yeast prion strains, as well as a non-prion substrate. These data suggest that the newly-identified mutations in the J domain of DNAJB6 cause aberrant chaperone function that leads to the pathogenesis in LGMDD1."
https://openalex.org/W3033070177,"The efficiency of somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) is low due to the strong resistance of somatic donor cells to epigenetic reprogramming. Many epigenetic drugs targeting DNA methylation and histone acetylation have been used in attempts to improve the in vitro and in vivo development of SCNT embryos. H3K9me3 has been shown to be an important reprogramming barrier for generating induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and SCNT embryos in mice and humans. In this study, we examined the effects of selective siRNA and chemical inhibition of H3K9me3 in somatic donor cells on the in vitro development of bovine SCNT embryos. Chaetocin, an inhibitor of SUV39H1/H2, was supplemented during the culture of donor cells. In addition, the siRNA knockdown of SUV39H1/H2 was performed in the donor cells. The effects of chaetocin and siSUV39H1/H2 on H3K9me3 and H3K9ac were quantified using flow cytometry. Furthermore, we assessed chaetocin treatment and SUV39H1/H2 knockdown on the blastocyst formation rate. Both chaetocin and siSUV39H1/H2 significantly reduced and elevated the relative intensity level of H3K9me3 and H3K9ac in treated fibroblast cells, respectively. siSUV39H1/H2 transfection, but not chaetocin treatment, improved the in vitro development of SCNT embryos. Moreover, siSUV39H1/H2 altered the expression profile of the selected genes in the derived blastocysts, similar to those derived from in vitro fertilization (IVF). In conclusion, our results demonstrated H3K9me3 as an epigenetic barrier in the reprogramming process mediated by SCNT in bovine species, a finding which supports the role of H3K9me3 as a reprogramming barrier in mammalian species. Our findings provide a promising approach for improving the efficiency of mammalian cloning for agricultural and biomedical purposes."
https://openalex.org/W3033197654,"Habitat selection links individual behavior to population abundance and dynamics, so evaluation of habitat selection is necessary for conservation and management. Land management can potentially alter both the structure and composition of habitats, thus influencing habitat selection and population size. Livestock grazing is the dominant land use worldwide and, while overstocking has been linked to the decline of many wildlife species, properly managed grazing could improve habitat quality and maintain native rangeland habitats. We evaluated breeding season habitat selection of female sharp-tailed grouse, an indicator species for grassland ecosystems, in relation to grazing management and landscape features in eastern Montana and western North Dakota. At broad spatial scales, females selected for multiple landscape features, including grassland, but exhibited no selection for either landscape or management variables when selecting habitat at smaller spatial scales. Females selected for pastures managed with rest-rotation grazing when choosing a home range, but selection did not equate to improved fitness. Moreover, we observed strong individual variation in both home range size and third-order habitat selection. While the high variability among individuals makes specific management recommendations difficult, selection for grassland habitats at broad scales suggests that strategies that maintain intact native rangelands are important for the conservation of sharp-tailed grouse."
https://openalex.org/W3033298605,"Dysfunctions in the GABAergic system lead to various pathological conditions and impaired inhibitory function is one of the causes behind neuropathies characterized by neuronal hyper excitability. The Dlx homeobox genes are involved in the development of nervous system, neural crest, branchial arches and developing appendages. Dlx genes also take part in neuronal migration and differentiation during development, more precisely, in the migration and differentiation of GABAergic neurons. Functional analysis of dlx genes has mainly been carried out in developing zebrafish embryos and larvae, however information regarding the expression and roles of these genes in the adult zebrafish brain is still lacking. The extensive neurogenesis that takes place in the adult zebrafish brain, makes them a good model for the visualization of mechanisms involving dlx genes during adulthood in physiological conditions and during regeneration of the nervous system. We have identified the adult brain regions where transcripts of dlx1a, dlx2a, dlx5a and dlx6a genes are normally found and have confirmed that within telencephalic domains, there is high overlapping expression of the four dlx paralogs with a marker for GABAergic neurons. Co-localization analyses carried with the Tg(dlx6a-1.4kbdlx5a/dlx6a:GFP) reporter line have also shown that in some areas of the diencephalon, cells expressing the dlx5a/6a bigene may have a neural stem cell identity. Furthermore, investigations in a response to stab wound lesions, have demonstrated a possible participation of the dlx5a/6a bigene, most likely of dlx5a, during regeneration of the adult zebrafish brain. These observations suggest a possible participation of dlx-expressing cells during brain regeneration in adult zebrafish and also provide information on the role of dlx genes under normal physiological conditions in adults."
https://openalex.org/W3033535742,"Louse flies (Diptera: Hippoboscidae) are obligate ectoparasites that often cause behavioral, pathogenic, and evolutionary effects on their hosts. Interactions between ectoparasites and avian hosts, especially migrating taxa, may influence avian pathogen spread in tropical and temperate ecosystems and affect long-term survival, fitness and reproductive success. The purpose of this study was to characterize the vector-associated microbiome of ectoparasitic louse flies feeding on migrating raptors over the fall migration period. Surveys for louse flies occurred during fall migration (2015-2016) at a banding station in Pennsylvania, United States; flies were collected from seven species of migrating raptors, and we sequenced their microbial (bacteria and archaea) composition using high-throughput targeted amplicon sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene (V4 region). All louse flies collected belonged to the same species, Icosta americana. Our analysis revealed no difference in bacterial communities of louse flies retrieved from different avian host species. The louse fly microbiome was dominated by a primary endosymbiont, suggesting that louse flies maintain a core microbial structure despite receiving blood meals from different host species. Thus, our findings highlight the importance of characterizing both beneficial and potentially pathogenic endosymbionts when interpreting how vector-associated microbiomes may impact insect vectors and their avian hosts."
https://openalex.org/W3033964657,"In this study, we investigated individual traits that influence the frequency of involuntary musical imagery (INMI) and the emotional valence of these occurrences using the experience sampling method (ESM) that measures INMI in daily life at the moment they occur. As individual traits, the effects of non-clinical obsessive-compulsive (OC) tendencies, personality traits, and musical expertise were examined. Among them, we were particularly interested in the effect of OC tendencies that are assumed to be related to INMI but are yet to be fully examined using ESM. A total of 101 university students completed questionnaires that assessed OC tendencies, the Big Five personality traits, and musical expertise. During the seven-day sampling period, participants received smartphone notifications six times per day and responded by stating whether they had experienced INMI and described the emotional characteristics of those occurrences. A multilevel analysis showed the relationship between OC tendencies and INMI. A positive effect was observed for intrusive thoughts (obsession) on the occurrence of INMI. Regarding the emotional characteristics of INMI, a negative effect of compulsive washing was observed on both the pleasantness of INMI experiences and the extent to which the participants liked the music they had heard internally. The effects of both personality traits and musical expertise were also observed in the analysis of INMI occurrences, both of which are consistent with previous findings. In summary, the present study using ESM supports previous findings on individual traits that affect INMI and clarifies them with additional detail and accuracy."
https://openalex.org/W3034172940,"This study explored brain responses to images that exploit incongruity as a creative technique, often used in advertising (i.e., surrealistic images). We hypothesized that these images would reveal responses akin to cognitive conflict resulting from incongruent trials in typical laboratory tasks (i.e., Stroop Task). Indeed, in many surrealistic images, common visual elements are juxtaposed to create un-ordinary associations with semantically conflicting representations. We expected that these images engage the conflict processing network that has been described in cognitive neuroscience theories. We addressed this hypothesis by measuring the power of mid-frontal Theta oscillations using EEG while participants watched images through a social media-like interface. Incongruent images, compared to controls, produced a significant Theta power increase, as predicted from the cognitive conflict theory. We also found increased memory for incongruent images one week after exposure, compared to the controls. These findings provide evidence for the incongruent images to effectively engage the viewer’s cognitive control and boost memorability. The results of this study provide validation of cognitive theories in real-life scenarios (i.e., surrealistic ads or art) and offer insights regarding the use of neural correlates as effectiveness metrics in advertising."
https://openalex.org/W3033322474,"Many fertilization models have been created to scientifically determine the amount of fertilization. With the same purpose, we constructed a nitrogen (N) application model, the leaf value model, which can make N fertilizer decisions in a timely, fast and nondestructive manner during rice planting. However, only one area (A1, Jiuzhou Town, Xixiu District, Guizhou Province) and one cultivar (Qyou6) were involved in the construction of the leaf value model. Its stability and applicability could not be well evaluated. Thus, we chose another area (A2, Jiuzhou Town, Huangping County, Guizhou Province) in Guizhou Province and carried out the experiment by using four cultivars (Nie5you5399, Qyou6, Yixiangyou2115 and Zhongzheyou8) for the leaf value model construction. Compared with the average value of apparent total N uptake (Nz) obtained in 2 years in the A1 area, that in the Qyou6 leaf value model in the A2 area increased by 12%, reaching 635.72 kg ha-1, whereas the corresponding target yield changed slightly, reaching 10,999.90 kg ha-1. Simultaneously, the linear relationship between several good SPAD value-derived indexes (Ys) and apparent N supply of the field (Nx) was still significant or extremely significant in the Qyou6 leaf value model. Compared with the A1 area, it slightly differed, and the R2 of SPADL1 was higher than that of SPADL3×L4/mean. In the leaf value model of the other three cultivars, the relationship between yield and Nx and that between Ys and Nx were significant or extremely significant. The Nz of Yixiangyou2115 and Zhongzheyou8 (618.33 and 617.76 kg ha-1) were close to that of Qyou6 and the corresponding target yields were 10313.36 and 10301.99 kg ha-1, respectively. The Nz and target yield of Nie5you5399 were lowest at 546.63 and 10680.24 kg ha-1, respectively. In general, this study showed that relationships used in the construction of leaf value model had certain stability and applicability to difference areas and cultivars. The leaf value model can be considered in N fertilizer decision-making of rice planting management."
https://openalex.org/W3033952009,"Introduction The run chart is one form of statistical process control chart that is particularly useful for detecting persistent shifts in data over time. The Anhøj rules test for shifts by looking for unusually long runs (L) of data points on the same side of the process centre (mean or median) and unusually few crossings (C) of the centre depending on the number of available data points (N). Critical values for C and L have mainly been studied in isolation. But what is really of interest is the joint distribution of C and L, which has so far only been studied using simulated data series. We recently released an R package, crossrun that calculates exact values for the joint probabilities of C and L that allowed us to study the diagnostic properties of the Anhøj rules in detail and to suggest minor adjustments to improve their diagnostic value. Methods Based on the crossrun R package we calculated exact values for the joint distribution of C and L for N = 10–100. Furthermore, we developed two functions, bestbox() and cutbox() that automatically seek to adjust the critical values for C and L to balance between sensitivity and specificity requirements. Results Based on exact values for the joint distribution of C and L for N = 10–100 we present measures of the diagnostic value of the Anhøj rules. The best box and cut box procedures improved the diagnostic value of the Anhøj rules by keeping the specificity and sensitivity close to pre-specified target values. Conclusions Based on exact values for the joint distribution of longest run and number of crossings in random data series this study demonstrates that it is possible to obtain better diagnostic properties of run charts by making minor adjustment to the critical values for C and L."
https://openalex.org/W3034159785,"Typing of Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) is traditionally performed by characterising the ompA gene, resulting in more than a dozen different genovars, A to L. Type L is associated with Lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) and commonly screened for using PCR, targeting the chromosomal pmpH gene. We aimed to develop and validate a new CT/LGV plasmid-based typing assay targeting the pgp3 gene, to increase sensitivity and thus reduce the number of non-typeable results.The new pgp3 PCR assay using LNA probes to detect point mutations was analytically and prospectively validated in a routine diagnostic laboratory setting. For the analytical tests, quantified nucleotide constructs (gBlocks) were used to perform limit of detection analyses. Quality control panel samples from 2018 and 2019 for CT were also tested. For the clinical study patient samples which were collected in two months in 2018 were tested simultaneously using the pmpH PCR and the pgp3 PCR.Analytically, the assay proved to be 100% specific relative to the previously used LGV typing assay targeting the single copy pmpH gene but it was much more sensitive to detect non-LGV CT. In the quality control panel 2 nonLGV samples and 7 LGV samples were solely positive with the pgp3 PCR and not with the pmpH PCR. None of the samples from analytical specificity panels were positive, indicating 100% specificity. In a prospective panel of 152 clinical samples, 142 (93%) were successfully typed with the pgp3 PCR compared to 78% with the pmpH PCR. The pgp3 PCR was fully concordant with the pmpH PCR to identify all LGV subtypes and detected an increased number of clinical samples of non-LGV subtype.We developed and validated a sensitive and specific plasmid-based typing assay to discriminate LGV from non-LGV CT subtypes. This is useful in a clinical setting to quickly determine the optimal treatment for Chlamydia trachomatis infections."
https://openalex.org/W3034070393,"To investigate the relative contribution of phenotypic and lifestyle factors to HbA1c, independent of fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and 2h post-load glucose (2hPG), in the general population.The study populations included 2309 participants without known diabetes from the first wave of the Hoorn Study (1989) and 2619 from the second wave (2006). Multivariate linear regression models were used to analyze the relationship between potential determinants and HbA1c in addition to FPG and 2hPG. The multivariate model was derived in the first wave of the Hoorn Study, and replicated in the second wave.In both cohorts, independent of FPG and 2hPG, higher age, female sex, larger waist circumference, and smoking were associated with a higher HbA1c level. Larger hip circumference, higher BMI, higher alcohol consumption and vitamin C intake were associated with a lower HbA1c level. FPG and 2hPG together explained 41.0% (first wave) and 53.0% (second wave) of the total variance in HbA1c. The combination of phenotypic and lifestyle determinants additionally explained 5.7% (first wave) and 3.9% (second wave).This study suggests that, independent of glucose, phenotypic and lifestyle factors are associated with HbA1c, but the contribution is relatively small. These findings contribute to a better understanding of the low correlation between glucose levels and HbA1c in the general population."
https://openalex.org/W3034075353,"Financing by patent pledge is an important way for small- and medium-sized pharmaceutical enterprises to address financing problems. In this study, eight indexes are analyzed considering both the pledge patent value and pledger credit value. And a prediction model for the patent pledge financing amount for pharmaceutical enterprises is constructed for the first time using the analytic hierarchy process and the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method. Three levels of financing amount are concluded through the prediction model and prediction results corresponding with the financing amount are displayed. This model was designed to help small- and medium-sized pharmaceutical enterprises get access to financing through patent pledge to relieve their financial stress. At the same time, it provides guides for pledgees and policymakers to improve the efficiency and quality of patent pledge. This work is reliable and valid in that it constructs this prediction model based on systematical data from official data sources."
