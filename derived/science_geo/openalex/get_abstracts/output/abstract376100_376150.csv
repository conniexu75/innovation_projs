Processes that rely on human mobility patterns, like the prediction of new epidemics, traffic engineering, or city planning, could benefit from highly accurate predictive models. To investigate the predictability of human dynamics, Song et al. (p. 1018 ) used the recorded trajectories of millions of mobile phone users, collected by mobile phone companies and anonymized for research purposes. They hypothesized that given the wide range of travel patterns that different users follow, there would be significant differences between their predictability as well: Users who travel less should be easier to predict than those who are constantly on the road. Surprisingly, there was 93% predictability across the whole user base, and individuals' predictability did not in general fall significantly below 80%."

https://openalex.org/W1991460349,"In recent years it has become clear that the therapeutic properties of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) are related not only to their ability to differentiate into different lineages but also to their capacity to suppress the immune response. We here studied the influence of MSC on macrophage function. Using mouse thioglycolate-elicited peritoneal macrophages (M) stimulated with LPS, we found that MSC markedly suppressed the production of the inflammatory cytokines TNF-α, IL-6, IL-12p70 and interferon-γ while increased the production of IL-10 and IL-12p40. Similar results were observed using supernatants from MSC suggesting that factor(s) constitutively released by MSC are involved. Supporting a role for PGE2 we observed that acetylsalicylic acid impaired the ability of MSC to inhibit the production of inflammatory cytokines and to stimulate the production of IL-10 by LPS-stimulated M. Moreover, we found that MSC constitutively produce PGE2 at levels able to inhibit the production of TNF-α and IL-6 by activated M. MSC also inhibited the up-regulation of CD86 and MHC class II in LPS-stimulated M impairing their ability to activate antigen-specific T CD4+ cells. On the other hand, they stimulated the uptake of apoptotic thymocytes by M. Of note, MSC turned M into cells highly susceptible to infection with the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi increasing more than 5-fold the rate of M infection. Using a model of inflammation triggered by s.c. implantation of glass cylinders, we found that MSC stimulated the recruitment of macrophages which showed a low expression of CD86 and the MHC class II molecule Iab and a high ability to produce IL-10 and IL-12p40, but not IL-12 p70. In summary, our results suggest that MSC switch M into a regulatory profile characterized by a low ability to produce inflammatory cytokines, a high ability to phagocyte apoptotic cells, and a marked increase in their susceptibility to infection by intracellular pathogens."
https://openalex.org/W2067887135,"Acid Assistance Protons are quite versatile catalysts of organic reactions, but because they are achiral, they cannot induce stereoselectivity on their own. One productive way around this problem has been to use chiral conjugate bases and perform reactions in media where the bases remain tightly attracted to protonated substrates. Xu et al. (p. 986 ; see the Perspective by Schreiner ) thoroughly explored the mechanism of an alternative approach, in which an achiral acid was used in conjunction with a second, chiral molecule (a urea derivative) for catalysis. High selectivity was attained with this method in the coupling of aryl imines with olefins. Extensive kinetic and computational studies showed that the acid and its chiral partner acted cooperatively in binding the substrates, optimizing the tradeoff between speed and selectivity."
https://openalex.org/W2034401306,"Killing Pseudomonas Gram-negative Pseudomonas bacteria are opportunistic pathogens, and drug-resistant strains present a serious health problem. Srinivas et al. (p. 1010 ) synthesized a family of peptidomimetic antibiotics that is active only against Pseudomonas . These antibiotics do not lyse the cell membrane, but instead target an essential outer membrane protein, LptD, which plays a role in the assembly of lipopolysaccharide in the outer cell membrane. Activity in a mouse infection model suggests that the antibiotics might have therapeutic potential. In addition, LptD is widely distributed in gram-negative bacteria and so its validation as a target has the potential to drive development of antibiotics with a broader spectrum of activity against gram-negative pathogens."

Our data show that the YTH domain conveys RNA binding ability to a new class of proteins that are found in all eukaryotic organisms. The binding of proteins to RNA is a fundamental aspect of biology that interferes with most aspects of gene expression and cellular functions. The presence of various binding motifs defines the group of RNA binding proteins (1Chen Y. Varani G. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 2088-2097Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Commonly found RNA binding domains include the RNA recognition motif (RRM), 3The abbreviations used are: RRMRNA recognition motifPUApseudouridine synthase and archaeosine transglycosylasesiRNAsmall interference RNARTreverse transcriptionSELEXsystematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment. the double-stranded RNA binding domain, the Piwi Argonaut and Zwille domain, and the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K homology domain. The most prominent RNA binding domain is the RRM that is found in ∼2% of human proteins (2Maris C. Dominguez C. Allain F.H. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 2118-2131Crossref PubMed Scopus (772) Google Scholar). The RRM is composed of two consensus sequences RNP2 and RNP1 that contain aromatic residues important for RNA binding. In other RNA binding motifs, such as the PUA (pseudouridine synthase and archaeosine transglycosylase) and OB-fold (oligonucleotide/oligosaccaride binding fold), the RNA interacts with the β-sheets that form pseudobarrels (3Pérez-Arellano I. Gallego J. Cervera J. FEBS J. 2007; 274: 4972-4984Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The general composition of the PUA domain is reminiscent of the OB-fold, a nucleic acid binding motif that displays only a low degree of sequence similarity between its members. The OB-fold consists of two three-stranded antiparallel β-sheets, where strand 1 is shared by both sheets. The individual β-sheets can be separated by protein parts of different length, which makes the identification based on primary structure difficult (4Theobald D.L. Mitton-Fry R.M. Wuttke D.S. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2003; 32: 115-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). The β-sheets in the PUA and OB-folds form a ligand binding surface that can bind to nucleic acids through aromatic stacking, hydrogen bonding, as well as polar and hydrophobic interactions. The so-far unexplained RNA binding activities of proteins such as apontic (5Lie Y.S. Macdonald P.M. Development. 1999; 126: 1129-1138PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrate that not all RNA binding domains have been described. RNA recognition motif pseudouridine synthase and archaeosine transglycosylase small interference RNA reverse transcription systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment. One of the potentially new RNA binding domains is the YTH (YT521 homology) domain. The YTH domain is highly conserved during evolution and was identified by comparing all known protein sequences with the splicing factor YT521-B (6Stoilov P. Rafalska I. Stamm S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 495-497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The domain is found only in eukaryotes and is abundant in plants. The YTH domain can be between 100 and 150 amino acids in size and is characterized by 14 invariant and 19 highly conserved residues. It is predicted to contain four α helices and six β strands. The conservation of aromatic residues within the β stands of the YTH domain is reminiscent of the RRM, PUA, and OB-fold structures. The presence of the YTH domain defines a new class of proteins from which currently 174 members have been identified in various eukaryotic species. YT521-B is the founding member of the YTH-containing proteins. It is a nuclear protein that interacts with other proteins implicated in RNA metabolism, such as Sam68/p62, rSLM-1, rSLM-2, hnRNPG, rSAF-B, and emerin (7Hartmann A.M. Nayler O. Schwaiger F.W.

Chem. 2001; 276: 8665-8673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The protein is localized in a novel nuclear compartment, the YT bodies, that overlaps with transcriptional start sites (10Nayler O. Hartmann A.M. Stamm S. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 949-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The protein regulates alternative splice site selection in a concentration-dependent manner and is only present in vertebrate species (11Rafalska I. Zhang Z. Benderska N. Wolff H. Hartmann A.M. Brack-Werner R. Stamm S. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2004; 13: 1535-1549Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The other molecularly characterized YTH-family protein is the nuclear yeast RNA binding protein Mmi1 (meiotic mRNA interception) that is part of a yeast mRNA-destruction system that eliminates meiotic-specific mRNAs (12Harigaya Y. Tanaka H. Yamanaka S. Tanaka K. Watanabe Y. Tsutsumi C. Chikashige Y. Hiraoka Y. Yamashita A. Yamamoto M. Nature. 2006; 442: 45-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 13McPheeters D.S. Cremona N. Sunder S. Chen H.M. Averbeck N. Leatherwood J. Wise J.A. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2009; 16: 255-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The biological function of the remaining YTH-family members that share no common sequence motifs outside the YTH domain is unknown. A structure of the YTH domain has been solved by NMR and was deposited without published analysis in the protein data base by the Japanese RIKEN Structural Genomics/Proteomics Initiative (accession number 2yud). Here, we demonstrate that the YTH domain is a novel RNA binding domain, which suggests a molecular function for the uncharacterized proteins of the YTH protein family. Recombinant YT521-B was generated by cloning full-length YT521-B (7Hartmann A.M. Nayler O. Schwaiger F.W. Obermeier A. Stamm S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3909-3926Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) and a YTH domain deletion mutant (YTHdel) into the vector pFastBac HTa (Invitrogen). Recombinant baculovirus and N-terminally His-tagged YT521-B or YTHdel was generated in Sf9 cells according to the manufacturer's instructions. YT521-B does not express in bacterial systems. SELEX was performed as described previously (14White E.K. Moore-Jarrett T. Ruley H.E. RNA. 2001; 7: 1855-1866PubMed Google Scholar) using recombinant YT521-B and a pool of N20-mers. The Matrix consensus sequence was determined using the CONSENSUS algorithm (15Hertz G.Z. Stormo G.D. Bioinformatics. 1999; 15: 563-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (946) Google Scholar), searching for 6-mers on the sense RNA strand. Minigene analysis was essentially performed as described (16Stoss O. Stoilov P. Hartmann A.M. Nayler O. Stamm S. Brain Res. Brain Res. Protoc. 1999; 4: 383-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The primers for the SXN reporter minigenes were: forward primer, CCATTTGACCATTCACCACA; reverse primer, CACTCCTGATGCTGTTATGG. With the exception of siRNA, all transfections were done using the calcium phosphate method, described in a previous study (16Stoss O. Stoilov P. Hartmann A.M. Nayler O. Stamm S. Brain Res. Brain Res. Protoc. 1999; 4: 383-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). siRNA analysis of minigenes was performed in HEK293 cells. The day before transfection, 40,000 cells were seeded in 0.5 ml of medium. On the day of transfection, 100 ng of minigenes and 34.5 ng of siRNA were diluted in 25 μl of HBS buffer (20 mm HEPES and 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4). 3 μl of Hyperfect Transfection Reagent (Qiagen) was added to 22 μl of HBS buffer. After incubating for 5 min at room temperature, the two dilutions were mixed and incubated for another 5 min at room temperature. The transfection complexes were added onto the cells. 42 h after transfection cells were harvested for RNA and protein isolation. The siRNA used was UGGAUUUGCAGGCGUGAAUUA. Array analysis was performed using Affymetrix Splicearrays. 1 μg of RNA was labeled using the RiboMinus Kit (Invitrogen), and hybridization was performed according to the GeneChip Whole Transcript Sense Target Labeling Assay Manual (Affymetrix). For microarray analysis, the Partek software (Partek Inc., St. Louis, MO) was employed. The algorithms used to analyze microarray data is an alternative splicing analysis of variance model implemented in Partek Genomics Suite. A filter is also used to select for probe sets showing a significant alternative splicing score, which is determined at a 5% false discovery rate. Only transcripts that have a high alternative splicing score but show no significant differential expression at the gene level were included in the candidate list that was verified by RT-PCR. YT521-B binding sites were identified using a previously described scoring-matrix based algorithm (17Schneider T.D. Stephens R.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 6097-6100Crossref PubMed Scopus (2464) Google Scholar). Briefly, the overall score is calculated by adding the score of each position: each position score is based on frequency of a given base at this position and on the amount of information present at this position, including the number of sequences involved to design the matrix. In our case, the motif score is calculated for each 6-mer of sequences to be tested. All 6-mers having a score above a threshold of larger than 3.04 were predicted to be potential YTH binding sites. Protein fold recognition analysis to detect relationship between the YTH sequence and the solved protein structures was done via the GeneSilico metaserver (18Kurowski M.A. Bujnicki J.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3305-3307Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). The YTH domain (amino acids 346–502) of Rattus norvegicus YT521-B protein was cloned into pTYB11 vector (New England Biolabs). This vector was transformed into Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) Codon +RIL (Stratagene). Cells were grown in minimal medium M9 containing 1 g/liter 15NH4Cl and 4 g/liter glucose (for 15N-labeled proteins) or 1 g/liter 15NH4Cl and 2 g/liter 13C-glucose (for 13C/15N-labeled proteins). Cell cultures were induced at A600 ∼ 0.6 by 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside at 18 °C and harvested after 30 h. Purification was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions on a Chitin column (New England Biolabs). Dialysis was performed using a 3.5-kDa cutoff membrane (Spectrum) against 50 mm HNa2PO4, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, pH 7.0. The protein was concentrated to ∼0.8 mm for measurements of the free protein. RNA (5′-GCAUAC-3′) was purchased from Dharmacon Research, deprotected according to the manufacturer instructions, desalted using a G-15 size-exclusion column (Amersham Biosciences), lyophilized, and resuspended in H2O (final concentration 1.3 mm). For titration experiments, RNA was stepwise added to the protein (0.2 mm concentration) in the NMR tube. NMR spectra were acquired on AvanceIII-600 and Avance-900 Bruker spectrometers equipped with triple resonance probes. Data were measured at 20 °C. NMR spectra were processed with Topspin1.3 (Bruker) and analyzed with SPARKY 3 (T. D. Goddard and D. G. Kneller, University of California, San Francisco). The 1H, 13C, and 15N chemical shifts of the free protein backbone were assigned by standard methods (19Sattler M. Schleucher J. Griesinger C. Prog. Nuclear Mag. Res. Spect. 1999; 34: 93-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (1399) Google Scholar). Figures of the NMR structure of the YTH domain were prepared using the program MOLMOL (20Koradi R. Billeter M. Wuthrich K. J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (6498) Google Scholar). Based on the predicted mixed α-helix β-sheet fold and conserved aromatic residues, we predicted that the YTH domain could bind to nucleic acids (6Stoilov P. Rafalska I. Stamm S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 495-497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). To test this hypothesis, we expressed YT521-B protein in Drosophila cells using the baculovirus system and investigated nucleic acid binding properties of the protein. A protein lacking the YTH domain (YTHdel) served as a control (Fig. 1A). Filter binding and pulldown assays indicated that YT521-B binds to single-stranded RNA, but not single- or double-stranded DNA sequences or double-stranded RNA (data not shown). To identify the sequence requirements of the RNA sequences that bind to YT521-B, we performed in vitro SELEX experiments using baculovirus-generated YT521-B protein and a pool of N20-mer RNA. After seven rounds of SELEX, we isolated RNA sequences that bind to recombinant YT521-B, which are shown in Fig. 1B. Similar to other RNA binding proteins, YT521-B binds to highly degenerate sequences that can be only described by a weight matrix, which is shown in Fig. 1C. None of the identified sequences contained stable RNA secondary structures as predicted by the Zucker algorithm (21Zuker M. Meth. Mol. Biol. 1994; 25: 267-294PubMed Google Scholar). We conclude that, similar to other RNA binding proteins (22Auweter S.D. Oberstrass F.C. Allain F.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 4943-4959Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar), YT521-B binds to short RNA motifs that loosely follow a consensus sequence. Next, we performed gel-retardation assays to test the ability of YT521-B to bind to RNA in a different experimental system. We used radioactively labeled probes containing the YTH domain binding motif and a non-related RNA probe lacking the motif (control). These probes were incubated in vitro with recombinant YT521-B, and a change in the probe's mobility was detected using non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. As a negative control, we used the YTH protein (YTHdel, Fig. 1A) that lacks the YTH domain, but contains all other protein parts. HeLa nuclear extract was used as a positive control. As shown in Fig. 2A, we observed a retardation in probe mobility in the presence of full-length YT521-B protein. We did not see a shift in mobility when the YTHdel protein, lacking the YTH, domain was used. A control RNA lacking the YTH binding motif did not show any RNA binding to YT521-B (Fig. 2B). Finally, we did not observe a mobility shift when a single-stranded DNA probe, with its sequence corresponding to the RNA probe, was used in the assay (Fig. 2C). Next, we determined the affinity between the YT521-B protein and RNA by titrating the amount of oligonucleotide used (supplemental Fig. S1A). Quantification showed that the Kd was 26 ± 8.5 μm. This affinity compared to a Kd of 20 μm and 1 μm for the RRM containing splicing factors SRp20 and PTB (23Hargous Y. Hautbergue G.M. Tintaru A.M. Skrisovska L. Golovanov A.P. Stevenin J. Lian L.Y. Wilson S.A. Allain F.H. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 5126-5137Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 24Bourgeois C.F. Lejeune F. Stevenin J. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2004; 78: 37-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 25Auweter S.D. Oberstrass F.C. Allain F.H. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 367: 174-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and a low micromolar affinity of K homology domains (26Valverde R. Edwards L. Regan L. FEBS J. 2008; 275: 2712-2726Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). However, other splicing factors, such as Fox-1, show a Kd in the subnanomolar range (27Auweter S.D. Fasan R. Reymond L. Underwood J.G. Black D.L. Pitsch S. Allain F.H. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 163-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). The data indicate that the YTH domain binds RNA with an affinity comparable to other splicing factors. Based on the SELEX data (Fig. 1, B and C) we designed a hexanucleotide GCAUAC and tested its binding to the YTH domain in an NMR titration experiment (Fig. 3A). The spectra show that the domain binds the sequence in the fast to intermediate exchange regime on the NMR timescale (milliseconds) and that the YTH domain is folded in the free as well as in the bound state. The construct used for NMR experiments (R. norvegicus, YT521-B, amino acids 346–502) was shorter than the one of the deposited structure (Homo sapiens, YTHDC1, amino acids 337–509), and its sequence is identical except that at position 352 in the rat sequence there is a serine instead of a tyrosine. This allowed us to use the structure to determine the binding interface. Next, we compared the spectra of the free YTH domain and the YTH domain bound to the GCAUAC RNA hexanucleotide. The observed shifts between the spectra (Fig. 3A) allowed us to assign the RNA binding surface of the YTH domain to the deposited structure of the human YTH domain. From this mapping, we observe a clear RNA binding surface that involves five protein loops and the N-terminal part of the α-helix (around As-385, Fig. 3B). This RNA binding surface is dense in positively charged residues, because it contains seven lysines, three arginines, and one histidine (Fig. 3C). Among the residues on this surface, Lys-364, Trp-380, and Arg-478 are absolutely conserved among YTH domains, suggesting that RNA binding might be general for YTH domains. These data show that the YTH domain used positively charged residues to interact with bound RNA. Previously, it was shown that increasing the YT521-B concentration influences alternative splice site selection (7Hartmann A.M. Nayler O. Schwaiger F.W. Obermeier A. Stamm S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3909-3926Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). We therefore used reporter minigenes to determine whether the binding between YT521-B and RNA sequences has an effect on alternative splice site selection in vivo. 20-mer sequences containing either one or two hexamer YT521-B binding sites were introduced into the alternatively spliced exon of the SXN-minigene (28Coulter L.R. Landree M.A. Cooper T.A. Mol. Cell Biol. 1997; 17: 2143-2150Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4A), which has been widely used to analyze the impact of sequences on pre-mRNA processing. We tested several SELEX winners in the minigenes, including the sequences we analyzed in gel-retardation assays (Fig. 2). In all experiments, the amount of YT521-B was changed by cotransfecting an increasing amount of expression constructs with the reporter minigene construct. An identical construct lacking the YTH domain (YTHdel, Fig. 1A) was used as a negative control. As can be seen in Fig. 4 (B and C), YT521-B promoted inclusion of the alternative exon in a concentration-dependent manner. In contrast, no effect could be detected when comparable amounts of YT521-B lacking the YTH domain were transfected (YTHdel, Fig. 4, B, C, and E), or when a reporter minigene was used that contained no YTH binding sequence in its alternative exon (Fig. 4D). Next, we used the same test system to investigate the effect of YT521-B depletion on alternative splice site selection and removed YT521-B by siRNA (Fig. 5A). siRNA was cotransfected with reporter minigenes containing one or two YT521-B binding sites, and the effect on splice site selection was determined by RT-PCR. In contrast to Fig. 4, where we transfected cells with calcium phosphate, we used a mixture of cationic and neutral lipids and longer times for these studies, which slightly changes the amount of basal exon inclusion. As shown in Fig. 5B, removal of YT521-B caused exon skipping in the reporter minigenes when the YT521-B binding site was present. In contrast, YT521-B did not affect exons lacking its binding site (Fig. 5C). Together, these data indicate that binding between YT521-B and pre-mRNA is necessary to influence alternative splice site selection in a YT521-B concentration-dependent manner. A striking feature of the YTH domain is the full evolutionary conservation of 14 residues between its members (Fig. 6A) (6Stoilov P. Rafalska I. Stamm S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 495-497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). To investigate their function for splice site selection, we mutated each residue and tested the mutants in cotransfection experiments using the MG-YT2 minigene (Fig. 4C). The regulation of its alternative exon by YT521-B requires the presence of the YTH domain (Fig. 4C), indicating that YT521-B exerts its effect by binding to the pre-mRNA and not by sequestering other splicing factors using its C terminus. The mutational analysis showed that changing the conserved residues Trp-380, Phe-412, and Gly-414 abolished the effect on splice site selection (Fig. 6B, circled in Fig. 6A). All mutants expressed similar amounts of protein of the expected size when compared with endogenous YT521-B (Fig. 6C), indicating that the change in activity is due to changes caused by the mutation. We confirmed the effect of the three point mutations on splice site selection by assaying them over a wider protein concentration range. As shown in Fig. 6D, even at higher concentrations that resulted in an increase of the mutant protein (Fig. 6E) none of the mutants was able to influence splice-site selection. A possible explanation for the loss of function could be a defect in RNA binding caused by the mutations. We tested this hypothesis by gel-shift analysis and found that mutating the three conserved mutants did completely abolish RNA binding (supplemental Fig. S1B). Because the residues are part of the hydrophobic core, it is likely that they are important for the structural integrity of the YTH domain. Their mutation could lead to a collapse of the domain and loss of RNA binding ability. In summary, these data show that three evolutionary conserved residues of the YTH domain are necessary for its ability to bind to RNA and modulate splice site selection. YT521-B is localized in a novel nuclear compartment, the YT body. To test whether the YTH domain influences the localization of other YT proteins, we determined the intracellular localization of all known human YT protein family members. As shown in Fig. 5F, the deletion of the YTH domain did not influence the localization of YT521-B in YT bodies. Furthermore, the three other human YTH domain-containing proteins, HGRG8/YTHDF2, DACA1/YTHDF1, and YTHDF3 are all localized in the cytosol. Together, these data indicate that the YTH domain does not dictate the localization of the proteins in which it resides. So far, the influence of YT521-B on splice site selection was limited to model constructs. To determine the effect of YT521-B on splice site selection of endogenous targets we performed genome-wide Affymetrix Splicearray analysis. We compared the splicing patterns of all known human genes in the presence or absence of overexpressed EGFP-YT521-B. Previous analyses revealed several examples where the presence of the YTH domain is not needed for the ability of YT521-B to influence splice-site selection. In these cases YT521-B most likely acts by sequestering other splicing factors that its binds to (7Hartmann A.M. Nayler O. Schwaiger F.W. Obermeier A. Stamm S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3909-3926Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 11Rafalska I. Zhang Z. Benderska N. Wolff H. Hartmann A.M. Brack-Werner R. Stamm S. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2004; 13: 1535-1549Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). This sequestration effect of splicing factors has been observed in other cases (29Stoilov P. Daoud R. Nayler O. Stamm S. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2004; 13: 509-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). To discriminate between direct and sequestration effects, we transfected either YT521-B or YT521-B lacking the YTH domain (YTHdel) into HEK293 cells and compared their mRNA isoforms with untransfected cells using Affymetrix Splicearrays. High scoring events were verified by RT-PCR using primers located in the constitutive exons that flank the alternative one. As shown in Fig. 7, several regulated events detected by array analysis can be verified by semi-quantitative RT-PCR. In these events, only YT521-B, but not the mutant YTHdel, influences splice site selection. Inspection of the regulated exons and their surrounding sequences showed the presence of YTH binding site clusters. An interesting aspect of the regulated genes is that similar to YT521-B they are all vertebrate-specific. Anubl1, Cxcl10, and Zfp687 genes are only expressed in vertebrates. In contrast, Rhot2 and Sec24c are found in all phyla, but the YT521-B-dependent exon is specific for vertebrates. These data suggest that YT521-B regulates vertebrate-specific RNAs, which it binds to via its YTH domain. We analyzed the role of the YTH domain in the founding member of the YTH domain family of proteins, YT521-B. Our data show that the function of the YTH domain is to bind to single-stranded, non-structured RNA. The relatively weak binding affinity of 26 ± 8.5 μm is comparable to other splicing regulators, such as SRp20, PTB, and K homology domain-containing proteins (23Hargous Y. Hautbergue G.M. Tintaru A.M. Skrisovska L. Golovanov A.P. Stevenin J. Lian L.Y. Wilson S.A. Allain F.H. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 5126-5137Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 24Bourgeois C.F. Lejeune F. Stevenin J. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2004; 78: 37-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 25Auweter S.D. Oberstrass F.C. Allain F.H. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 367: 174-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 26Valverde R. Edwards L. Regan L. FEBS J. 2008; 275: 2712-2726Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). However, because the binding is weak compared with other splicing factors such as Fox-1, it is likely that YT521-B binding to RNA is aided by interacting proteins that stabilize its RNA binding, which is common among splicing factors. Another feature of RNA sequences recognized by YT521-B and several splicing factors is their high degeneracy. This degeneracy of the RNAs binding to the YTH domain was also observed for the other biochemically characterized member of the YTH domain proteins, Mmi1 (12Harigaya Y. Tanaka H. Yamanaka S. Tanaka K. Watanabe Y. Tsutsumi C. Chikashige Y. Hiraoka Y. Yamashita A. Yamamoto M. Nature. 2006; 442: 45-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Mmi1 binds to RNA of at least four yeast target genes, which contain a cis-acting element called determinant of selective removal. No strong consensus sequence could be identified in these determinants of selective removal, suggesting that the YTH domain of Mmi1 also recognizes highly degenerate RNA sequences. The Splicearray analysis shows that the YTH domain regulates distinct pre-mRNAs, which shows high specific recognition in vivo. Because all in vivo targets of YT521-B contain clusters of the binding motif, the high specificity observed in vivo is most likely due to binding of multiple YT521-B molecules to a single RNA. The formation of these complexes is facilitated by the ability of YT521-B C termini to bind to each other (7Hartmann A.M. Nayler O. Schwaiger F.W. Obermeier A. Stamm S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3909-3926Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). It is therefore likely that the high specificity of YT521-B in vivo is achieved by combining interactions between different proteins and binding of their YTH domains to several degenerate motifs on the RNA. A further similarity of YT521-B and the YTH domain-containing protein Mmi1 (12Harigaya Y. Tanaka H. Yamanaka S. Tanaka K. Watanabe Y. Tsutsumi C. Chikashige Y. Hiraoka Y. Yamashita A. Yamamoto M. Nature. 2006; 442: 45-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar) is their localization in dynamic nuclear foci. YT521-B is localized in a novel nuclear compartment, the YT body, whose formation is regulated by phosphorylation (11Rafalska I. Zhang Z. Benderska N. Wolff H. Hartmann A.M. Brack-Werner R. Stamm S. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2004; 13: 1535-1549Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Mmi1 is found in several scattered foci during mitosis but, due to its interaction with Mei2, converges into one single dot in meiosis (12Harigaya Y. Tanaka H. Yamanaka S. Tanaka K. Watanabe Y. Tsutsumi C. Chikashige Y. Hiraoka Y. Yamashita A. Yamamoto M. Nature. 2006; 442: 45-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). The comparison of all YTH domain protein family members shows that in addition to the YTH domain they contain numerous other protein domains that mostly enable protein interaction. Yeast two-hybrid analysis of YT521-B demonstrated that the YTH domain is not necessary for binding to other proteins (7Hartmann A.M. Nayler O. Schwaiger F.W. Obermeier A. Stamm S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3909-3926Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). A possible general function of the YTH domain could therefore be to add RNA binding ability to proteins containing other interaction domains. The YTH domain is not a cellular targeting signal, as we demonstrated that the human YTH protein family members reside both in the nucleus and cytosol. It is therefore likely that YTH protein family members function in different aspects of cellular RNA metabolism. New PSI-BLAST searches of databases for YTH homologs revealed no obvious relationships to sequences other than the previously described members of the YTH family (6Stoilov P. Rafalska I. Stamm S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 495-497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). To identify related structures, we performed a fold recognition analysis using the GeneSilico metaserver (18Kurowski M.A. Bujnicki J.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3305-3307Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). We found a significant relationship of the YTH domain (residues 358–495 of YT521-B) to a group of closely related protein structures from the uncharacterized protein family DUF55. The structures indicated by Protein Data Bank with codes 2ar1, 1zce, 2eve, 2gbs, and 1wmm have been solved, and one of them (2ar1) has been described previously (30Arakaki T. Le Trong I. Phizicky E. Quartley E. DeTitta G. Luft J. Lauricella A. Anderson L. Kalyuzhniy O. Worthey E. Myler P.J. Kim D. Baker D. Hol W.G. Merritt E.A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. F Struct. Biol. Cryst. Commun. 2006; 62: 175-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), but so far no functional analysis was published for any of them. Our theoretical predictions agreed closely with the NMR structure and showed that the YTH domain is related to the DUF55 family, because it exhibited a high similarity to 2zbn structure (hypothetical protein PH1033), expressed as root mean square deviation of 2.6 Å over 125 superimposable residues (DALI Z-score, 11.5). We found that both the YTH structure and the structures of DUF55 proteins resemble PUA domains, many of which are RNA binding motifs related to the OB-fold (31Li M. Rasulova F. Melnikov E.E. Rotanova T.V. Gustchina A. Maurizi M.R. Wlodawer A. Protein Sci. 2005; 14: 2895-2900Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). For example 2yud/YTH exhibits root mean square deviation of 3.7 Å over 84 superimposable residues of 2ane/PUA structure (DALI Z-score 3.3). They share the core pattern of secondary structures: β1-α1-β2-α2-β3-β4-β5-β6, even though they exhibit different elaborations in the C terminus: α3-β7-α4-α5 in YTH but β7 in PUA. The YTH domain also exhibits an additional N-terminal α helix that is missing from PUA and DUF55 domains. Supplemental Fig. S2 illustrates the common topology of the polypeptide chain of YTH/DUF55 and PUA structures, local structural differences notwithstanding. In support of our analysis the DUF55 family has been recently included in the PUA superfamily in the SCOP data base. Together, our data indicate that the YTH domain is closely related to the DUF55 family and more remotely related to the PUA domain that has been previously implicated in RNA binding. NMR titration experiment of the YTH domain in complex with the GCAUAC oligonucleotide showed that the RNA interacts with a protein surface containing eleven positively charged amino acids. To determine the role of the evolutionary conserved residues we performed a mutational analysis. We could mutate most conserved residues without changing the ability of the mutants to change splice site selection. The only exceptions were residues Trp-380, Phe-412, and Gly-414. Mutating these residues abolished RNA binding of YT521-B. Mapping of the mutated residues onto the 2yud structure revealed that the invariant residues Trp-380 and Phe-412 are in the hydrophobic core and are therefore most likely essential for the YTH domain stability. Gly-414 is located within a buried β-strand, where any bigger side chain would interfere with the backbone of a neighboring β-strand. Phe-412 is adjacent to this residue in the same β-strand and is probably needed for proper folding. Again, this is reminiscent to a glycine residue that is conserved due to steric reason both in PUA domains (32Aravind L. Koonin E.V. J. Mol. Evol. 1999; 48: 291-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) and in the structurally related classic OB-fold (4Theobald D.L. Mitton-Fry R.M. Wuttke D.S. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2003; 32: 115-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). However, the remaining nine invariant residues YTH domain can be mutated without interfering with splice site selection. These residues map on the surface of the YTH domain (Fig. 3) and with the exception of Lys-364 and Arg-478 are not located on the RNA binding surface. The substitution of individual residues that belong to this group may locally influence the structure, but it is unlikely to disrupt the global fold. It is possible that these residues are evolutionary conserved to form a scaffold that allows the arrangement of positively charged residues that bind to RNA. Because these positively charged residues are less conserved among YTH domain family members, it is likely that individual members have different RNA binding properties. The YTH domain is found in all eukaryotes. Data base analysis indicates that its founding member, YT521-B, is present only in vertebrate genomes. Similar to other splicing factors like SF2/ASF, SRp30c, and tra2-β1 (29Stoilov P. Daoud R. Nayler O. Stamm S. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2004; 13: 509-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), YT521-B can influence splice site selection indirectly by sequestration of other proteins, suggesting that numerous genes might be affected without direct involvement of the YTH domain. To determine direct, RNA-dependent influences on splice site selection, we performed array analysis that compared overexpression of YT521-B with a mutant lacking the YTH domain. This analysis demonstrates that either the pre-mRNAs or the alternative exons that are directly regulated by YT521-B are also vertebrate-specific. With the exception of Zfp687 and Rhot2 where the alternative exons keep the frame, all other exons regulated by YT521-B introduce stop codons or generate frameshifts, suggesting that YT521-B can influence the generation of proteins from different genes. A detailed analysis of NOVA target genes demonstrated that this splicing regulatory protein influences a set of functionally related genes (33Ule J. Stefani G. Mele A. Ruggiu M. Wang X. Taneri B. Gaasterland T. Blencowe B.J. Darnell R.B. Nature. 2006; 444: 580-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). The example of YT521-B shows that a splicing factor cannot only regulate functionally related pre-mRNAs, but also evolutionary related RNAs. All YT521-B target genes share an array of YTH binding sites on the RNA, which is probably recognized by multiple YT521-B molecules that also bind to each other. The formation of this vertebrate-specific complex generates then a vertebrate-specific readout of the genome. Download .pdf (5.9 MB) Help with pdf files"

Overexpression of this kinase has been associated with the development of Down syndrome in both human and animal models, whereas single copy loss-of-function of DYRK1A leads to increased apoptosis and decreased brain size. Although more than a dozen of DYRK1A targets have been identified, the molecular basis of its involvement in neuronal development remains unclear. Here we show that DYRK1A and another pro-survival member of the DYRK family, DYRK3, promote cell survival through phosphorylation and activation of SIRT1, an NAD+-dependent protein deacetylase that is essential in a variety of physiological processes including stress response and energy metabolism. DYRK1A and DYRK3 directly phosphorylate SIRT1 at Thr522, promoting deacetylation of p53. A SIRT1 phosphorylation mimetic (SIRT1 T522D) displays elevated deacetylase activity, thus inhibiting cell apoptosis. Conversely, a SIRT1 dephosphorylation mimetic (SIRT1 T522V) fails to mediate DYRK-induced deacetylation of p53 and cell survival. We show that knockdown of endogenous DYRK1A and DYRK3 leads to hypophosphorylation of SIRT1, sensitizing cells to DNA damage-induced cell death. We also provide evidence that phosphorylation of Thr522 activates SIRT1 by promoting product release, thereby increasing its enzymatic turnover. Taken together, our findings provide a novel mechanism by which two anti-apoptotic DYRK members promote cell survival through direct modification of SIRT1.

https://openalex.org/W2057108646,"From Big Fish to Big Whales Whales are the largest animals today, and many feed on the abundant plankton, particularly diatoms, in the oceans. Whales arose and diversified in the Cenozoic, about 30 to 40 million years ago (see the Perspective by Cavin ). Marx and Uhen (p. 993 ) show that their diversity parallels the diversity of diatoms and changes in ocean temperature. Whether there were large predators of plankton before whales has been enigmatic, because the fossil record during the Mesozoic (245 to 65 million years ago) is sparse. Friedman et al. (p. 990 ) now show that a group of large fish filled this role for nearly 100 million years in the Mesozoic. Although not as large as whales, these globally distributed fish were still several meters long. Their extinction at the Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary 65.5 million years ago may have cleared the seas for the evolution of whales."
https://openalex.org/W2051800611,"Cyanobacterial morphology is diverse, ranging from unicellular spheres or rods to multicellular structures such as colonies and filaments. Multicellular species represent an evolutionary strategy to differentiate and compartmentalize certain metabolic functions for reproduction and nitrogen (N2) fixation into specialized cell types (e.g. akinetes, heterocysts and diazocytes). Only a few filamentous, differentiated cyanobacterial species, with genome sizes over 5 Mb, have been sequenced. We sequenced the genomes of two strains of closely related filamentous cyanobacterial species to yield further insights into the molecular basis of the traits of N2 fixation, filament formation and cell differentiation. Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii CS-505 is a cylindrospermopsin-producing strain from Australia, whereas Raphidiopsis brookii D9 from Brazil synthesizes neurotoxins associated with paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP). Despite their different morphology, toxin composition and disjunct geographical distribution, these strains form a monophyletic group. With genome sizes of approximately 3.9 (CS-505) and 3.2 (D9) Mb, these are the smallest genomes described for free-living filamentous cyanobacteria. We observed remarkable gene order conservation (synteny) between these genomes despite the difference in repetitive element content, which accounts for most of the genome size difference between them. We show here that the strains share a specific set of 2539 genes with >90% average nucleotide identity. The fact that the CS-505 and D9 genomes are small and streamlined compared to those of other filamentous cyanobacterial species and the lack of the ability for heterocyst formation in strain D9 allowed us to define a core set of genes responsible for each trait in filamentous species. We presume that in strain D9 the ability to form proper heterocysts was secondarily lost together with N2 fixation capacity. Further comparisons to all available cyanobacterial genomes covering almost the entire evolutionary branch revealed a common minimal gene set for each of these cyanobacterial traits."
https://openalex.org/W2011594621,"Hsp60, a Group I mitochondrial chaperonin, is classically considered an intracellular chaperone with residence in the mitochondria; nonetheless, in the last few years it has been found extracellularly as well as in the cell membrane. Important questions remain pertaining to extracellular Hsp60 such as how generalized is its occurrence outside cells, what are its extracellular functions and the translocation mechanisms that transport the chaperone outside of the cell. These questions are particularly relevant for cancer biology since it is believed that extracellular chaperones, like Hsp70, may play an active role in tumor growth and dissemination.Since cancer cells may undergo necrosis and apoptosis, it could be possible that extracellular Hsps are chiefly the result of cell destruction but not the product of an active, physiological process. In this work, we studied three tumor cells lines and found that they all release Hsp60 into the culture media by an active mechanism independently of cell death. Biochemical analyses of one of the cell lines revealed that Hsp60 secretion was significantly reduced, by inhibitors of exosomes and lipid rafts.Our data suggest that Hsp60 release is the result of an active secretion mechanism and, since extracellular release of the chaperone was demonstrated in all tumor cell lines investigated, our observations most likely reflect a general physiological phenomenon, occurring in many tumors."
https://openalex.org/W1998133320,"Excessive activity of dendritic cells (DCs) is postulated as a central disease mechanism in Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE). Vitamin D is known to reduce responsiveness of healthy donor DCs to the stimulatory effects of Type I IFN. As vitamin D deficiency is reportedly common in SLE, we hypothesized that vitamin D might play a regulatory role in the IFNalpha amplification loop in SLE. Our goals were to investigate the relationship between vitamin D levels and disease activity in SLE patients and to investigate the effects of vitamin D on DC activation and expression of IFNalpha-regulated genes in vitro.In this study, 25-OH vitamin D (25-D) levels were measured in 198 consecutively recruited SLE patients. Respectively, 29.3% and 11.8% of African American and Hispanic SLE patient had 25-D levels <10 ng/ml. The degree of vitamin D deficiency correlated inversely with disease activity; R = -.234, p = .002. In 19 SLE patients stratified by 25-D levels, there were no differences between circulating DC number and phenotype. Monocyte-derived DCs (MDDCs) of SLE patients were normally responsive to the regulatory effects of vitamin D in vitro as evidenced by decreased activation in response to LPS stimulation in the presence of 1,25-D. Additionally, vitamin D conditioning reduced expression of IFNalpha-regulated genes by healthy donor and SLE MDDCs in response to factors in activating SLE plasma.We report on severe 25-D deficiency in a substantial percentage of SLE patients tested and demonstrate an inverse correlation with disease activity. Our results suggest that vitamin D supplementation will contribute to restoring immune homeostasis in SLE patients through its inhibitory effects on DC maturation and activation. We are encouraged to support the importance of adequate vitamin D supplementation and the need for a clinical trial to assess whether vitamin D supplementation affects IFNalpha activity in vivo and, most importantly, improves clinical outcome."

Thus, studies are mainly limited to controlled simulations of likely reactions in early Earth conditions. Similarly, chemical reactions in the laboratory may generate the products necessary for biosynthesis, but may nevertheless be geochemically irrelevant. Lambert et al. (p. 984 ) show that silicate ions, present in Earth's surface waters at relatively high concentrations, catalyze the formation of four- and six-carbon sugars from simple sugars via the formose reaction. The resulting complexes stabilize the sugar molecules, allowing sugars to accumulate in greater abundance. Silicate stabilization also circumvents the need for the formose reaction to proceed at high temperatures, thus extending the range of possible environments in which life could have originated."

Our previously published results from homing pigeons have made us suggest that the iron containing sensory dendrites in the inner dermal lining of the upper beak are a candidate structure for such an avian magnetometer system. Here we show that similar structures occur in two species of migratory birds (garden warbler, Sylvia borin and European robin, Erithacus rubecula) and a non-migratory bird, the domestic chicken (Gallus gallus). In all these bird species, histological data have revealed dendrites of similar shape and size, all containing iron minerals within distinct subcellular compartments of nervous terminals of the median branch of the Nervus ophthalmicus. We also used microscopic X-ray absorption spectroscopy analyses to identify the involved iron minerals to be almost completely Fe III-oxides. Magnetite (Fe II/III) may also occur in these structures, but not as a major Fe constituent. Our data suggest that this complex dendritic system in the beak is a common feature of birds, and that it may form an essential sensory basis for the evolution of at least certain types of magnetic field guided behavior."
https://openalex.org/W2056980409,"Background Adenosine is generated in response to cellular stress and damage and is elevated in the lungs of patients with chronic lung disease. Adenosine signaling through its cell surface receptors serves as an amplifier of chronic lung disorders, suggesting adenosine-based therapeutics may be beneficial in the treatment of lung diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Previous studies in mouse models of chronic lung disease demonstrate that the key components of adenosine metabolism and signaling are altered. Changes include an up-regulation of CD73, the major enzyme of adenosine production and down-regulation of adenosine deaminase (ADA), the major enzyme for adenosine metabolism. In addition, adenosine receptors are elevated. Methodology/Principal Findings The focus of this study was to utilize tissues from patients with COPD or IPF to examine whether changes in purinergic metabolism and signaling occur in human disease. Results demonstrate that the levels of CD73 and A2BR are elevated in surgical lung biopsies from severe COPD and IPF patients. Immunolocalization assays revealed abundant expression of CD73 and the A2BR in alternatively activated macrophages in both COPD and IPF samples. In addition, mediators that are regulated by the A2BR, such as IL-6, IL-8 and osteopontin were elevated in these samples and activation of the A2BR on cells isolated from the airways of COPD and IPF patients was shown to directly induce the production of these mediators. Conclusions/Significance These findings suggest that components of adenosine metabolism and signaling are altered in a manner that promotes adenosine production and signaling in the lungs of patients with COPD and IPF, and provide proof of concept information that these disorders may benefit from adenosine-based therapeutics. Furthermore, this study provides the first evidence that A2BR signaling can promote the production of inflammatory and fibrotic mediators in patients with these disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2069367347,"Cognitive control and working memory processes have been found to be influenced by changes in motivational state. Nevertheless, the impact of different motivational variables on behavior and brain activity remains unclear.The current study examined the impact of incentive category by varying on a within-subjects basis whether performance during a working memory task was reinforced with either secondary (monetary) or primary (liquid) rewards. The temporal dynamics of motivation-cognition interactions were investigated by employing an experimental design that enabled isolation of sustained and transient effects. Performance was dramatically and equivalently enhanced in each incentive condition, whereas neural activity dynamics differed between incentive categories. The monetary reward condition was associated with a tonic activation increase in primarily right-lateralized cognitive control regions including anterior prefrontal cortex (PFC), dorsolateral PFC, and parietal cortex. In the liquid condition, the identical regions instead showed a shift in transient activation from a reactive control pattern (primary probe-based activation) during no-incentive trials to proactive control (primary cue-based activation) during rewarded trials. Additionally, liquid-specific tonic activation increases were found in subcortical regions (amygdala, dorsal striatum, nucleus accumbens), indicating an anatomical double dissociation in the locus of sustained activation.These different activation patterns suggest that primary and secondary rewards may produce similar behavioral changes through distinct neural mechanisms of reinforcement. Further, our results provide new evidence for the flexibility of cognitive control, in terms of the temporal dynamics of activation."

Here we demonstrate a mechanism by which the intracellular, carboxy-terminal tail of polycystin-1 (CP1) regulates mTOR signaling by altering the subcellular localization of the tuberous sclerosis complex 2 (TSC2) tumor suppressor, a gatekeeper for mTOR activity. Phosphorylation of TSC2 at S939 by AKT causes partitioning of TSC2 away from the membrane, its GAP target Rheb, and its activating partner TSC1 to the cytosol via 14-3-3 protein binding. We found that TSC2 and a C-terminal polycystin-1 peptide (CP1) directly interact and that a membrane-tethered CP1 protects TSC2 from AKT phosphorylation at S939, retaining TSC2 at the membrane to inhibit the mTOR pathway. CP1 decreased binding of 14-3-3 proteins to TSC2 and increased the interaction between TSC2 and its activating partner TSC1. Interestingly, while membrane tethering of CP1 was required to activate TSC2 and repress mTOR, the ability of CP1 to inhibit mTOR signaling did not require primary cilia and was independent of AMPK activation. These data identify a unique mechanism for modulation of TSC2 repression of mTOR signaling via membrane retention of this tumor suppressor, and identify PC-1 as a regulator of this downstream component of the PI3K signaling cascade."
https://openalex.org/W1980045712,"Adverse events in pregnancy may ‘programme’ offspring for the later development of cardiovascular disease and hypertension. Previously, using a rodent model of programmed hypertension we have demonstrated the role of the renin-angiotensin system in this process. More recently we showed that a maternal low protein diet resulted in undermethylation of the At1b angiotensin receptor promoter and the early overexpression of this gene in the adrenal of offspring. Here, we investigate the hypothesis that maternal glucocorticoid modulates this effect on fetal DNA methylation and gene expression. We investigated whether treatment of rat dams with the 11β-hydroxylase inhibitor metyrapone, could prevent the epigenetic and gene expression changes we observed. Offspring of mothers subjected to a low protein diet in pregnancy showed reduced adrenal Agtr1b methylation and increased adrenal gene expression as we observed previously. Treatment of mothers with metyrapone for the first 14 days of pregnancy reversed these changes and prevented the appearance of hypertension in the offspring at 4 weeks of age. As a control for non-specific effects of programmed hypertension we studied offspring of mothers treated with dexamethasone from day 15 of pregnancy and showed that, whilst they had raised blood pressure, they failed to show any evidence of Agtr1b methylation or increase in gene expression. We conclude that maternal glucocorticoid in early pregnancy may induce changes in methylation and expression of the Agtr1b gene as these are clearly reversed by an 11 beta-hydroxylase inhibitor. However in later pregnancy a converse effect with dexamethasone could not be demonstrated and this may reflect either an alternative mechanism of this glucocorticoid or a stage-specific influence."
https://openalex.org/W2044662575,"Trimethoprim resistance is increasing in Enterobacteriaceae. In 2004-2006 an intervention on trimethoprim use was conducted in Kronoberg County, Sweden, resulting in 85% reduction in trimethoprim prescriptions. We investigated the distribution of dihydrofolate reductase (dfr)-genes and integrons in Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae and the effect of the intervention on this distribution.Consecutively isolated E. coli (n = 320) and K. pneumoniae (n = 54) isolates phenotypically resistant to trimethoprim were studied. All were investigated for the presence of dfrA1, dfrA5, dfrA7, dfrA8, dfrA12, dfrA14, dfrA17 and integrons class I and II. Isolates negative for the seven dfr-genes (n = 12) were also screened for dfr2d, dfrA3, dfrA9, dfrA10, dfrA24 and dfrA26. These genes accounted for 96% of trimethoprim resistance in E. coli and 69% in K. pneumoniae. The most prevalent was dfrA1 in both species. This was followed by dfrA17 in E. coli which was only found in one K. pneumoniae isolate. Class I and II Integrons were more common in E. coli (85%) than in K. pneumoniae (57%). The distribution of dfr-genes did not change during the course of the 2-year intervention.The differences observed between the studied species in terms of dfr-gene and integron prevalence indicated a low rate of dfr-gene transfer between these two species and highlighted the possible role of narrow host range plasmids in the spread of trimethoprim resistance. The stability of dfr-genes, despite large changes in the selective pressure, indirectly suggests a low fitness cost of dfr-gene carriage."
https://openalex.org/W2101597347,"Bergmann glial cells play critical roles in the structure and function of the cerebellum. During development, their radial processes serve as guides for migrating granule neurons and their terminal endfeet tile to form the glia limitans. As the cerebellum matures, Bergmann glia perform important roles in synaptic transmission and synapse maintenance, while continuing to serve as essential structural elements. Despite growing evidence of the diverse functions of Bergmann glia, the molecular mechanisms that mediate these functions have remained largely unknown. As a step toward identifying the molecular repertoire underlying Bergmann glial function, here we examine global gene expression in individual Bergmann glia from developing (P6) and mature (P30) mouse cerebellum. When we select for developmentally regulated genes, we find that transcription factors and ribosomal genes are particularly enriched at P6 relative to P30; whereas synapse associated molecules are enriched at P30 relative to P6. We also analyze genes expressed at high levels at both ages. In all these categories, we find genes that were not previously known to be expressed in glial cells, and discuss novel functions some of these genes may potentially play in Bergmann glia. We also show that Bergmann glia, even in the adult, express a large set of genes thought to be specific to stem cells, suggesting that Bergmann glia may retain neural precursor potential as has been proposed. Finally, we highlight several genes that in the cerebellum are expressed in Bergmann glia but not astrocytes, and may therefore serve as new, specific markers for Bergmann glia."

In all cases tested, the DHR-1 domain has been found necessary for the cellular function of full-length Dock180 family proteins. Here, we report the crystal structure of the DHR-1 domain of Dock1, which comprises a C2 core with several large insertions, and identify the structural and energetic determinants of phospholipid recognition in vitro and in cells. These findings, when combined with recent advances by others, lead us to propose a model for how full-length Dock1 coordinates membrane specificity conferred by the DHR-1 domain with the GEF activity of the DHR-2 domain, which provides a structural framework for probing the diverse biological functions mediated by the Dock180 family of GEFs. The domain boundaries of Dock1 DHR-1 were previously defined (12Côté J.F. Motoyama A.B. Bush J.A. Vuori K. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 797-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). The Dock1 DHR-1 domain (422–619) was cloned in pET28a and expressed in Escherichia coli as a His6-tagged fusion protein. The protein was purified using HiTrap Ni2+-chelating and Superdex 200 gel filtration columns (GE Healthcare). Protein purity and identity were confirmed by SDS-PAGE, immunoblot, and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange method (Stratagene) in plasmid pET-28a, and confirmed by DNA sequencing. Mutant proteins were expressed and purified as for wild-type, and melting temperature profiles were determined using a CSC Nano II Differential Scanning Calorimeter. Experiments were carried out on a Microcal VP ITC200 isothermal titration calorimeter from Microcal (Northampton, MA). Each titration involved 19 injections of 2-μl aliquots of ∼1 mm water-soluble di-C8 phosphoinositide analogs (Echelon Biosciences, Salt Lake City, UT) or InsP4 into cells containing 25–100 μm DHR-1 at 23 °C. Buffers were comprised of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and either 14 or 145 mm NaCl. Folding and monodispersity of DHR-1 were confirmed by size exclusion chromatography and differential scanning calorimetry. To account for heat changes associated with dilution of the phosphoinositide analogs, control titrations into buffer were employed. The use of di-C8 phosphoinositide stock solutions at ∼1 mm concentration avoids complications arising from micelle formation (critical micellar concentration ∼5 mm). By lowering the NaCl concentration to 15 mm, the enthalpy change increased by ∼4-fold, and reproducible binding curves that achieved full saturation were obtained for wild-type and mutant proteins. For the competition assays, a 1.5 m excess of either the PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 or PtdIns(4,5)P2 analogs was first incubated with DHR-1 in the ITC cell, prior to titration of the other phospholipid. For Ca2+ binding experiments, aliquots of 4.0 or 8.0 mm CaCl2 were injected into cells containing 200 or 400 μm DHR-1 (which had previously been dialyzed in 2 mm EGTA). No binding was observed (data not shown). Thermodynamic parameters were obtained using the Origin 7 software package (Microcal). DHR-1 crystals were grown at 293 K using the microbatch method under oil. 1.5 μl of solution containing 5.5 mg/ml of DHR-1 in 12.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, 75 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, was mixed with 3 μl of reservoir containing 30% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 10K, 0.2 m sodium acetate, 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.8. Crystals grew as monoclinic plates within 2–3 weeks, and were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen after briefly rinsing in paratone-N oil.

The asymmetric unit includes two DHR-1 domains, 81 water molecules, and a modified residue (the β-mercaptoethanol adduct of C595) in each domain. Electron density was not observed for the His tag, the N terminus (422–424 in both copies), or the C terminus (610/612–619), or for a surface loop within the β7–β8 subdomain (580/581–587). The L1 and L3 loops have relatively weak density, but distinct conformations are evident for molecules A and B (supplemental Fig. S1). The root mean square deviation between backbone atoms of the two molecules in the asymmetric unit is 0.54 Å (for 161 equivalent residues). Stereochemical quality of the final model was assessed using AutoDepInputTool (42Yang H. Guranovic V. Dutta S. Feng Z. Berman H.M. Westbrook J.D. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol.

Data collection and refinement statistics are summarized in Table 1. Docking simulations were performed with Molegro Virtual Docker (46Thomsen R. Christensen M.H. J. Med. Chem. 2006; 49: 3315-3321Crossref PubMed Scopus (1721) Google Scholar) using di-C2 PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 or its head group, inositol 1,3,4,5-tetraphosphate (InsP4). The docking runs included a maximum of 1500 iterations with a population size of 50 and a minimum of 10 runs. Binding modes were analyzed using the “re-ranking score.” Docking solutions from the initial runs, with no search space constraints and default parameters, were clustered at two sites. In the subsequent docking simulations, side chain flexibility was introduced, and the search space radius was set to 20 or 15 Å from the centers of the binding cavities. Distance restraints penalized the interaction between the aliphatic carbon atoms di-C2 PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 and the protein. The “MolDock [GRID]” scoring function and “Tabu pose” clustering algorithms were used for side chain flexible docking simulations. Side chain torsional angles allowed to vary during simulation were: on the upper surface, Lys439, Ser441, Lys442, Thr443, Thr444, Lys446, Asn447, Tyr484, Gln485, His515, Gln519, Asp523, Lys524, Phe529, and Lys555; and in the β-groove, Glu449, Thr451, Ser453, Tyr455, Arg461, Glu477, Lys479, Arg510, Arg514, Arg516, Lys527, Ile528, Glu562, and Asp600. For modeling full-length Dock1, dimeric DHR-2/Rac1 and ARM-repeat Dock1 models were based on the crystal structures of Dock9 DHR-2/Cdc42 (PDB code 2WM9) (13Yang J. Zhang Z. Roe S.M. Marshall C.J. Barford D. Science. 2009; 325: 1398-1402Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) and importin-β (PDB code 2QNA) (47Wohlwend D. Strasser A. Dickmanns A. Ficner R. J. Mol.

The ARM-DHR-2 interaction interface was determined using the RosettaDock docking algorithm (50Lyskov S. Gray J.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2008; 36: W233-W238Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). CHO LR73 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin-streptomycin antibiotics, and assayed as previously described (11Komander D. Patel M.

Cells were starved overnight in 0.1% serum medium, then allowed to spread on fibronectin, and stained for Dock1, actin, and cell nuclei. Anti-Dock1 (H-4 and H-70) and anti-Myc (9E10) antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnologies. We expressed a construct of Dock1 in E. coli comprising residues 422–619, which is the minimal fragment that maintains specific PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 binding activity (12Côté J.F. Motoyama A.B. Bush J.A. Vuori K. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 797-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). We determined its crystal structure at 2.37-Å resolution (Table 1, FIGURE 1, FIGURE 2 using automated molecular replacement searches and phase recombination (see “Experimental Procedures” and Table 1). The central core of the structure adopts an anti-parallel β-sandwich with the “type II” C2 domain fold (a circular permutation of the more common “type I” topology (51Grobler J.A. Essen L.O. Williams R.L. Hurley J.H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 788-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 52Hurley J.H. Misra S. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2000; 29: 49-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar)), in which two 4-stranded sheets with strand orders 6-5-2-3 and 7-8-1-4 create convex- and concave-exposed faces, respectively. Structural comparisons using DALI (53Holm L. Kääriäinen S. Rosenström P. Schenkel A. Bioinformatics. 2008; 24: 2780-2781Crossref PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar) show that the β-sandwich core is similar to at least 38 C2 domains (of either topology) in the PDB with root mean square deviations between 1.7 and 3.6 Å for 101–143 Cα atoms, but very low identities in all cases: 7–16% (supplemental Fig. S2). Elaborations to the core include three loops (β1–β2 = L1; β3–β4 = L2; and β5–β6 = L3) on the upper surface, as well as two further large insertions (see below) that may explain why sequence alignment algorithms had difficulty in recognizing the C2-fold (12Côté J.F. Motoyama A.B. Bush J.A. Vuori K. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 797-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). The most extensive structural similarity occurs with the C2 domain of PtdIns 3-kinase (supplemental Fig. S3; root mean square difference = 2.8 Å for 143 Cαs; 10% identity), which, intriguingly, is the enzyme that generates PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 at the leading edge of migrating cells.FIGURE 2Sequences of Dock180 family DHR-1 domains.

The secondary structure is indicated. The 3 surface loops, L1–L3, are indicated by red boxes; they are delimited by conserved residues marked by black arrows. Residues predicted to contact phospholipid in Dock1 DHR-1 are marked with a red asterisk; those supported by mutagenesis are boxed in blue. Contact residues in other family members predicted by homology are shown in blue (H/K/R) or red (others). Conserved structural residues are in black (bold). Residues mutated in this study that do not affect phospholipid binding are highlighted in yellow; 3 of these are on L3 but point into the β-groove. The 2 large insertions in the C2 core are also indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The crystals contain two independent copies of the DHR-1 domain (molecules “A” and “B”), which are very similar except for the conformations of the large loops (L1 and L3) on the upper surface of the domain (supplemental Fig. S3). In Molecule A, which is free from lattice contacts in the loop region, a cluster of lysines points inward, whereas acidic residues point outward, creating a positively charged pocket at the top of the molecule. In Molecule B, a major lattice contact appears to trigger or stabilize a distinct organization of the loops in which the charged residues create a network of salt bridges, and the positively charged pocket seen in Molecule A is not observed. The absence of crystal contacts, as well as mutagenesis and modeling studies (see below), are fully consistent with Molecule A representing the functional conformation in solution. Moreover, we found that a point mutant (D436Y) that disrupts a salt bridge observed only in Molecule B had no functional effect (see below). Molecule A was therefore used for all modeling and structural analysis. In addition to the 3 surface loops, there are 2 major elaborations of the C2 core: a 20-residue insertion (457–476) between β2 and β3 on one side of the sandwich; and a 42-residue (557–598) subdomain inserted between β7 and β8 that packs against the opposite side (FIGURE 1, FIGURE 2). The β2–β3 insertion first forms a ridge along the bottom of the 6-5-2-3 sheet; it then crosses over to the 7-8-1-4 sheet, forming a short strand (β3A) that augments the β4 end of the sheet and provides two hydrophobic side chains (Val465 and Ile466) that insert into and seal this edge of the sandwich, before returning to the C2 core via a well defined loop that is unique to DHR-1. β3 is irregular at its C-terminal end, where it adopts cross-sheet interactions with the side chains of Glu493 and the buried Trp491. The β7–β8 insertion forms a subdomain at the opposite edge of the β-sandwich, beginning with an extension of the β7 strand (β7′) that crosses over to the other sheet, forming main chain hyd"
https://openalex.org/W2025863257,"The action of dopamine on the aggregation of the unstructured alpha-synuclein (α-syn) protein may be linked to the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. Dopamine and its oxidation derivatives may inhibit α-syn aggregation by non-covalent binding. Exploiting this fact, we applied an integrated computational and experimental approach to find alternative ligands that might modulate the fibrillization of α-syn. Ligands structurally and electrostatically similar to dopamine were screened from an established library. Five analogs were selected for in vitro experimentation from the similarity ranked list of analogs. Molecular dynamics simulations showed they were, like dopamine, binding non-covalently to α-syn and, although much weaker than dopamine, they shared some of its binding properties. In vitro fibrillization assays were performed on these five dopamine analogs. Consistent with our predictions, analyses by atomic force and transmission electron microscopy revealed that all of the selected ligands affected the aggregation process, albeit to a varying and lesser extent than dopamine, used as the control ligand. The in silico/in vitro approach presented here emerges as a possible strategy for identifying ligands interfering with such a complex process as the fibrillization of an unstructured protein."
https://openalex.org/W2014909345,"Genomic integration of human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA accounts for more than 90% of cervical cancers. High-risk genital HPVs encode E6 proteins that can interact with a cellular ubiquitin ligase E6-associated protein (E6AP) and target the tumor suppressor p53 for ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis. Currently, how this critical event is regulated is largely unknown. Here we report that activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3), a broad DNA damage sensor whose expression is frequently downregulated in cervical cancer, interacted with E6 and prevented p53 from ubiquitination and degradation mediated by the viral protein. Consistent with its role as a potent E6 antagonist, ATF3 expressed enforcedly in HPV-positive SiHa cells activated p53, leading to expression of p53-target genes (e.g. p21 and PUMA), cell cycle arrest and apoptotic cell death. The leucine zipper domain of ATF3 appears indispensable for these effects as an ATF3 mutant lacking this domain failed to interact with E6 and activate p53 in the cervical cancer cells. The prevention of p53 degradation was unlikely caused by binding of ATF3 to the tumor suppressor, but rather was a consequence of disruption of the E6-E6AP interaction by ATF3. These results indicate that ATF3 plays a key role in a mechanism defending against HPV-induced carcinogenesis, and could serve as a novel therapeutic target for HPV-positive cancers.

Lancet. 2007; 370: 890-907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1960) Google Scholar). Genomic integration of HPV DNA, occurring in more than 90% of cervical cancers, results in expression of a viral protein E6, which in turn inactivates the tumor suppressor p53 by driving its proteolysis (3Scheffner M. Werness B. Huibregtse J.M. Levine A.J. Howley P.M. Cell. 1990; 63: 1129-1136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3429) Google Scholar). The E6 protein can bind to p53 at both the C terminus and the central DNA-binding region (4Li X. Coffino P. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 4509-4516Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and recruit a cellular protein E6AP to p53 (5Huibregtse J.M. Scheffner M. Howley P.M. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 4129-4135Crossref PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar, 6Scheffner M. Huibregtse J.M. Vierstra R.D. Howley P.M. Cell. 1993; 75: 495-505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1952) Google Scholar). E6AP belongs to the HECT family of E3 ubiquitin ligases and can catalyze the addition of ubiquitin moieties to p53, leading to its degradation by the 26 S proteasomes (6Scheffner M. Huibregtse J.M. Vierstra R.D. Howley P.M. Cell. 1993; 75: 495-505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1952) Google Scholar). Because the p53 gene is rarely mutated in cervical cancer, the E6-mediated degradation serves as the major mechanism inactivating p53 and promoting cervical carcinogenesis (7Hengstermann A. Linares L.K. Ciechanover A. Whitaker N.J. Scheffner M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 1218-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar).In addition to p53 and E6AP, the E6 protein interacts with many other cellular proteins including Bak (8Thomas M. Banks L. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 2943-2954Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar), Bax (9Vogt M. Butz K. Dymalla S. Semzow J. Hoppe-Seyler F.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5061-5072Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar), and BRCA1 (11Zhang Y. Fan S. Meng Q. Ma Y. Katiyar P. Schlegel R. Rosen E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 33165-33177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), presumably through the four CXXC motifs sparsely distributed in the viral protein (12Huibregtse J.M. Beaudenon S.L. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1996; 7: 317-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). These interactions account for the oncogenic activities of E6, which include not only promoting transformation but also enhancing cell proliferation and survival (13zur Hausen H. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 342-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (3078) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is important to dissect the E6 interaction network for a better understanding of the molecular basis for cervical cancer and identification of therapeutic targets for the disease.ATF3 is a member of the ATF/CREB family of transcription factors and can be rapidly induced by DNA damage and other oncogenic stimuli (14Hai T. Wolfgang C.D. Marsee D.K. Allen A.E. Sivaprasad U. Gene Expression. 1999; 7: 321-335PubMed Google Scholar, 15Hai T. Hartman M.G. Gene. 2001; 273: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar). Whereas consequences of ATF3 induction are unclear, it is often assumed that ATF3 functions as a transcription factor to regulate gene expression thereby contributing to cellular responses to oncogenic stresses (14Hai T. Wolfgang C.D. Marsee D.K. Allen A.E. Sivaprasad U. Gene Expression. 1999; 7: 321-335PubMed Google Scholar, 15Hai T. Hartman M.G. Gene. 2001; 273: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar). However, emerging evidence indicates that this DNA-binding protein can also regulate cellular functions through mechanisms beyond transcriptional regulation (16Yan C. Lu D. Hai T. Boyd D.D. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 2425-2435Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). ATF3 contains a central leucine zipper domain (Zip) that is well characterized as a mediator of protein-protein interaction (17Phizicky E.M. Fields S. Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 59: 94-123Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). ATF3 binds to p53 via this domain, and as a consequence, p53 ubiquitination catalyzed by MDM2, the major ubiquitin ligase in HPV-negative cells (18Haupt Y. Maya R. Kazaz A. Oren M. Nature. 1997; 387: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (3656) Google Scholar, 19Kubbutat M.H. Jones S.N. Vousden K.H. Nature. 1997; 387: 299-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (2812) Google Scholar), is blocked, leading to up-regulation of the p53 tumor suppressor activity independent of the ATF3 transcriptional activity (16Yan C. Lu D. Hai T. Boyd D.D. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 2425-2435Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). These findings are consistent with recent reports that ATF3 expression is down-regulated in a wide range of human cancers (20Beer D.G. Kardia S.L. Huang C.C. Giordano T.J. Levin A.M. Misek D.E. Lin L. Chen G. Gharib T.G. Thomas D.G. Lizyness M.L. Kuick R. Hayasaka S. Taylor J.M. Iannettoni M.D. Orringer M.B. Hanash S. Nat.

Cell Cycle. 2006; 5: 926-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), arguing for a link between ATF3 expression and tumor suppression (23Yan C. Boyd D.D. Cell Cycle. 2006; 5: 926-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In line with this notion, we report here the identification of ATF3 as a novel E6 repressor that can compete with E6AP for binding to the viral protein thereby activating p53 in HPV-positive cervical cancer cells. These results indicate that ATF3 could contribute to suppression of HPV-induced carcinogenesis.DISCUSSIONExpression of HPV proteins such as E6 is a driving force for cervical carcinogenesis (1zur Hausen H. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2000; 92: 690-698Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Schiffman M. Castle P.E. Jeronimo J. Rodriguez A.C. Wacholder S. Lancet. 2007; 370: 890-907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1960) Google Scholar). The HPV proteins promote malignant transformation by intervening in functions of various cellular proteins through protein-protein interactions (38Boulet G. Horvath C. Vanden Broeck D. Sahebali S. Bogers J. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2007; 39: 2006-2011Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). While cellular proteins regulated by the viral proteins have been well documented (38Boulet G. Horvath C. Vanden Broeck D. Sahebali S. Bogers J. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2007; 39: 2006-2011Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), little is known as to how the oncogenic activities of the HPV proteins are regulated. In this study, we identified ATF3 as a novel repressor of the HPV E6 protein. ATF3 bound to E6 and prevented p53 degradation mediated by the viral protein. Because it is widely induced by oncogenic stimuli (e.g. DNA damage) (14Hai T. Wolfgang C.D. Marsee D.K. Allen A.E. Sivaprasad U. Gene Expression. 1999; 7: 321-335PubMed Google Scholar, 15Hai T. Hartman M.G. Gene. 2001; 273: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar), ATF3 could serve as a key activator of p53 in HPV-infected cervix epithelium thereby defending against oncogenic transformation, a notion which is supported by our recent observation that ATF3 expression is frequently down-regulated in cervical cancers (23Yan C. Boyd D.D. Cell Cycle. 2006; 5: 926-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Whereas the mechanism(s) for ATF3 down-regulation in cervical cancer remains elusive, decreased ATF3 expression allows E6 to drive p53 degradation thereby contributing to cervical carcinogenesis. Moreover, the demonstration of ATF3 as a direct binding partner of E6 suggests that ATF3 could regulate other oncogenic activities of E6 such as activation of telomerase and the Src family kinase Blk (39Veldman T. Horikawa I. Barrett J.C. Schlegel R. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 4467-4472Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 40Oda H. Kumar S. Howley P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1999; 96: 9557-9562Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Activation of the latter proteins promotes cell proliferation, which acts in concert with p53 inactivation to promote the genesis and progression of cervical cancer (13zur Hausen H. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 342-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (3078) Google Scholar). Therefore, this study has identified a novel mechanism by which the oncogenic activities of HPV proteins are antagonized. Because enforced expression of ATF3 can restore p53 activity and induce apoptosis of HPV-positive cancer cells, targeting ATF3 expression through chemical interventions or gene therapy could be a promising strategy to treat cervical cancer. Interestingly, recent studies have revealed a causal role of HPV infection in the genesis of head and neck cancer (41Tran N. Rose B.R. O'Brien C.J. Head Neck. 2007; 29: 64-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 42Chung C.H. Gillison M.L. Clin. Cancer Res. 2009; 15: 6758-6762Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Therefore, the significance of the current findings may extend beyond the understanding of the etiology of cervical cancer. Indeed, we recently reported that ATF3 promotes anti-cancer effects of curcumin (43Yan C. Jamaluddin M.S. Aggarwal B. Myers J. Boyd D.D. Mol. Cancer Ther. 2005; 4: 233-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar), an agent currently in clinical trials, in a p53-wild-type head and neck cancer cell line (44Xu L. Davidson B.J. Murty V.V. Li R.G. Sacks P.G. Garinchesa P. Schantz S.P. Chaganti R.S. Int. J. Cancer. 1994; 59: 383-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). It is very likely that the HPV-antagonizing activity of ATF3 described here contributes to such an effect.ATF3 is well recognized as a stress responsive protein (14Hai T. Wolfgang C.D. Marsee D.K. Allen A.E. Sivaprasad U. Gene Expression. 1999; 7: 321-335PubMed Google Scholar). Although ATF3 induction occurs frequently in the early stage of the DNA damage response, the role of ATF3 in cancer development remains undecided. Whereas earlier studies indicate that ATF3 may promote growth and dissemination of malignant cells (45Ishiguro T. Nakajima M. Naito M. Muto T. Tsuruo T. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 875-879PubMed Google Scholar, 46Perez S. Vial E. van Dam H. Castellazzi M. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 1135-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), results from many other studies strongly argue for a detrimental role that ATF3 plays in cancer development (47Bottone Jr., F.G.

Cell. 2003; 11: 915-926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). Indeed, ATF3 deficiency leads to cellular transformation induced by the Ras oncogene (16Yan C. Lu D. Hai T. Boyd D.D. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 2425-2435Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 49Lu D. Wolfgang C.D. Hai T. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 10473-10481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Our current findings that ATF3 antagonizes the oncogenic activity of a HPV viral protein further argues for the notion that ATF3 induction can function as an anticancer barrier to defend against oncogenic transformation (16Yan C. Lu D. Hai T. Boyd D.D. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 2425-2435Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 23Yan C. Boyd D.D. Cell Cycle. 2006; 5: 926-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar).In addition to suppression of E6-mediated p53 degradation, we previously demonstrated that ATF3 stabilizes and activates p53 in HPV-negative cells (16Yan C. Lu D. Hai T. Boyd D.D. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 2425-2435Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) where the p53 level is mainly controlled by MDM2 (50Michael D. Oren M. Semin. Cancer Biol. 2003; 13: 49-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar). Interestingly, it appears that ATF3 regulates p53 degradation mediated by MDM2 and E6 through distinct mechanisms. While ATF3 blocks MDM2-mediated ubiquitination by binding to p53 and altering its conformation (16Yan C. Lu D. Hai T. Boyd D.D. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 2425-2435Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), we have shown here that the ATF3-p53 interaction was dispensable for suppression of the E6-mediated degradation. Indeed, although ATF3 binding may cover the lysine residues clustered at the p53 C terminus (16Yan C. Lu D. Hai T. Boyd D.D. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 2425-2435Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), p53 ubiquitination mediated by E6 does not occur in the C terminus (36Camus S. Higgins M. Lane D.P. Lain S. FEBS Lett. 2003; 536: 220-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 51Nakamura S. Roth J.A. Mukhopadhyay T. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 2605-2610Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Moreover, because it can also bind to p53 at the core DNA-binding domain (4Li X. Coffino P. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 4509-4516Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), E6 might not compete with ATF3 for binding to the C terminus of the tumor suppressor, a consideration supported by the results that ATF3 failed to disrupt the E6-p53 interaction (Fig. 7A). Our results suggest that ATF3 rather suppresses E6-mediated p53 degradation through direct binding to the viral protein. Such an interaction prevents E6AP from binding to E6 (Fig. 7B), and thus blocks the recruitment of the ubiquitin ligase to p53, leading to diminished ubiquitination and proteolysis of the latter protein (Fig. 7D). Therefore, these results reiterate the importance of ATF3 in activating p53 in response to distinct oncogenic challenges.Whereas the binding of E6 to the p53 C terminus does not require E6AP, the presence of the E3 ubiquitin ligase is likely indispensable for E6 binding to the p53 DNA binding domain (4Li X. Coffino P. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 4509-4516Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). If the ATF3 binding disrupts the E6-E6AP interaction (Fig. 7B), it raises the questions as to how this achieves and how the E6-p53 interaction occurs in the absence of E6AP. E6 is a small protein containing four CXXC motifs that form two conserved internal sequence repeats (52Liu Y. Baleja J.D. Front. Biosci. 2008; 13: 121-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). It might be that ATF3 competes with E6AP for binding to the same region(s) of the viral protein while the p53 conformation changes conferred by ATF3 interaction with its C terminus (16Yan C. Lu D. Hai T. Boyd D.D. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 2425-2435Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) allow E6 bind to p53 via the central DNA binding domain (Fig. 7D). Alternatively, the p53 C terminus might be preferably bound by E6 despite the presence of ATF3. Interestingly, although the leucine-zipper domain of ATF3 does not contain the charged leucine motif (LXXLL) that commonly exists in E6-associated proteins (53Bohl J. Das K. Dasgupta B. Vande Pol S.B. Virology. 2000; 271: 163-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), it enriches leucine residues and can form a α-helix, which is one of the common structural characteristics of E6-binding proteins (54Chen J.J. Hong Y. Rustamzadeh E. Baleja J.D. Andorphy E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13537-13544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Thus, it would be of interest to investigate whether other leucine zipper-containing proteins also interact with E6 and regulate the oncogenic activities of the viral protein.Independent of its activity to drive p53 degradation, E6 also represses p53 trans-activation activity by inhibiting p300-mediated acetylation of p53 and histones (10Patel D. Huang S.M. Bagila L.A. McCane D.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5061-5072Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 35Thomas M.C. Chiang C.M. Mol. Cell. 2005; 17: 251-264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The results from our reporter assays indicate that ATF3 not only restored the p53 activity decreased by E6, but also increased the p53 trans-activation activity by several folds (Fig. 6C). These results argue for a possibility that ATF3 regulates the p53 transcriptional activity independent of regulating its stability. The ATF3 binding might alter p53 conformation to a state favoring its binding to DNA, or its interaction with transcription activators/co-activators (e.g. p300, TFIIH, mediators) (55Teufel D.P. Fruend S.M. Bycroft M. Fersht A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 7009-7014Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 56Xiao H. Pearson A. Coulombe B. Truant R. Zhang S. Regier J.L.

Cell. 2007; 27: 121-133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Alternatively, ATF3 might directly recruit these transcription activators/co-activators to p53-target promoters. It might also be that ATF3 competes with transcription co-repressors for binding to p53 and its target promoters (58Kitagawa M. Lee S.H. McCormick F. Mol. Cell. 2008; 29: 217-231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Regardless of the mechanism(s), the capability of ATF3 to promote p53 trans-activation provides the cell with an additional means of activating p53 in response to a large variety of oncogenic stresses.In summary, we have identified ATF3 as a novel repressor of the HPV E6 protein. ATF3 activates p53 by dissociating E6AP from the viral protein thereby preventing p53 degradation. Because E6 is the major protein that inactivates p53 in HPV-positive cells, these findings argue for a model in which ATF3 induction by DNA damage antagonizes the oncogenic activity of the E6 protein and thereby serves as an anticancer barrier to prevent carcinogenesis upon HPV infections (Fig. 7D).

Genomic integration of HPV DNA, occurring in more than 90% of cervical cancers, results in expression of a viral protein E6, which in turn inactivates the tumor suppressor p53 by driving its proteolysis (3Scheffner M.

The E6 protein can bind to p53 at both the C terminus and the central DNA-binding region (4Li X. Coffino P. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 4509-4516Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and recruit a cellular protein E6AP to p53 (5Huibregtse J.M. Scheffner M. Howley P.M.

Cell. 1993; 75: 495-505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1952) Google Scholar). E6AP belongs to the HECT family of E3 ubiquitin ligases and can catalyze the addition of ubiquitin moieties to p53, leading to its degradation by the 26 S proteasomes (6Scheffner M. Huibregtse J.M. Vierstra R.D. Howley P.M. Cell. 1993; 75: 495-505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1952) Google Scholar). Because the p53 gene is rarely mutated in cervical cancer, the E6-mediated degradation serves as the major mechanism inactivating p53 and promoting cervical carcinogenesis (7Hengstermann A. Linares L.K. Ciechanover A. Whitaker N.J. Scheffner M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 1218-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar).In addition to p53 and E6AP, the E6 protein interacts with many other cellular proteins including Bak (8Thomas M. Banks L. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 2943-2954Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar), Bax (9Vogt M. Butz K. Dymalla S. Semzow J. Hoppe-Seyler F.

Chem. 2005; 280: 33165-33177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), presumably through the four CXXC motifs sparsely distributed in the viral protein (12Huibregtse J.M. Beaudenon S.L. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1996; 7: 317-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). These interactions account for the oncogenic activities of E6, which include not only promoting transformation but also enhancing cell proliferation and survival (13zur Hausen H. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 342-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (3078) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is important to dissect the E6 interaction network for a better understanding of the molecular basis for cervical cancer and identification of therapeutic targets for the disease.ATF3 is a member of the ATF/CREB family of transcription factors and can be rapidly induced by DNA damage and other oncogenic stimuli (14Hai T. Wolfgang C.D. Marsee D.K. Allen A.E. Sivaprasad U. Gene Expression. 1999; 7: 321-335PubMed Google Scholar, 15Hai T. Hartman M.G. Gene. 2001; 273: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar). Whereas consequences of ATF3 induction are unclear, it is often assumed that ATF3 functions as a transcription factor to regulate gene expression thereby contributing to cellular responses to oncogenic stresses (14Hai T. Wolfgang C.D. Marsee D.K. Allen A.E. Sivaprasad U. Gene Expression. 1999; 7: 321-335PubMed Google Scholar, 15Hai T. Hartman M.G. Gene. 2001; 273: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar). However, emerging evidence indicates that this DNA-binding protein can also regulate cellular functions through mechanisms beyond transcriptional regulation (16Yan C. Lu D. Hai T. Boyd D.D. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 2425-2435Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). ATF3 contains a central leucine zipper domain (Zip) that is well characterized as a mediator of protein-protein interaction (17Phizicky E.M. Fields S. Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 59: 94-123Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). ATF3 binds to p53 via this domain, and as a consequence, p53 ubiquitination catalyzed by MDM2, the major ubiquitin ligase in HPV-negative cells (18Haupt Y. Maya R. Kazaz A. Oren M. Nature. 1997; 387: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (3656) Google Scholar, 19Kubbutat M.H. Jones S.N. Vousden K.H. Nature. 1997; 387: 299-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (2812) Google Scholar), is blocked, leading to up-regulation of the p53 tumor suppressor activity independent of the ATF3 transcriptional activity (16Yan C. Lu D. Hai T. Boyd D.D. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 2425-2435Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). These findings are consistent with recent reports that ATF3 expression is down-regulated in a wide range of human cancers (20Beer D.G. Kardia S.L. Huang C.C. Giordano T.J. Levin A.M. Misek D.E.

The gene encodes the BRCT-domain containing protein microcephalin/BRIT1. Apart from its role in the regulation of chromosome condensation, the protein is involved in the cellular response to DNA damage. We report here on the first mouse model of impaired Mcph1-function. The model was established based on an embryonic stem cell line from BayGenomics (RR0608) containing a gene trap in intron 12 of the Mcph1 gene deleting the C-terminal BRCT-domain of the protein. Although residual wild type allele can be detected by quantitative real-time PCR cell cultures generated from mouse tissues bearing the homozygous gene trap mutation display the cellular phenotype of misregulated chromosome condensation that is characteristic for the human disorder, confirming defective Mcph1 function due to the gene trap mutation. While surprisingly the DNA damage response (formation of repair foci, chromosomal breakage, and G2/M checkpoint function after irradiation) appears to be largely normal in cell cultures derived from Mcph1gt/gt mice, the overall survival rates of the Mcph1gt/gt animals are significantly reduced compared to wild type and heterozygous mice. However, we could not detect clear signs of premature malignant disease development due to the perturbed Mcph1 function. Moreover, the animals show no obvious physical phenotype and no reduced fertility. Body and brain size are within the range of wild type controls. Gene expression on RNA and protein level did not reveal any specific pattern of differentially regulated genes. To the best of our knowledge this represents the first mammalian transgenic model displaying a defect in mitotic chromosome condensation and is also the first mouse model for impaired Mcph1-function."
https://openalex.org/W2166619695,"Erythropoietin is a growth factor commonly used to manage anemia in patients with chronic kidney disease. A significant clinical challenge is relative resistance to erythropoietin, which leads to use of successively higher erythropoietin doses, failure to achieve target hemoglobin levels, and increased risk of adverse outcomes. Erythropoietin acts through the erythropoietin receptor (EpoR) present in erythroblasts. Alternative mRNA splicing produces a soluble form of EpoR (sEpoR) found in human blood, however its role in anemia is not known.Using archived serum samples obtained from subjects with end stage kidney disease we show that sEpoR is detectable as a 27kDa protein in the serum of dialysis patients, and that higher serum sEpoR levels correlate with increased erythropoietin requirements. Soluble EpoR inhibits erythropoietin mediated signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (Stat5) phosphorylation in cell lines expressing EpoR. Importantly, we demonstrate that serum from patients with elevated sEpoR levels blocks this phosphorylation in ex vivo studies. Finally, we show that sEpoR is increased in the supernatant of a human erythroleukaemia cell line when stimulated by inflammatory mediators such as interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor alpha implying a link between inflammation and erythropoietin resistance.These observations suggest that sEpoR levels may contribute to erythropoietin resistance in end stage renal disease, and that sEpoR production may be mediated by pro-inflammatory cytokines."

A population based baseline demographic census and a malaria prevalence follow up were performed in two river side localities in the suburbs of Porto Velho city and in its rural vicinity. The quantification and nature of malaria parasites in clinical patients and asymptomatic parasite carriers were performed using microscopic and Real Time PCR methodologies. Anopheles densities and their seasonal variation were done by monthly captures for defining HBR (hourly biting rate) values.(i) malaria among residents show the riverside profile, with population at risk represented by children and young adults; (ii) asymptomatic vivax and falciparum malaria parasite carriers correspond to around 15% of adults living in the area; (iii) vivax malaria relapses were responsible for 30% of clinical cases; (iv) malaria risk for the residents was evaluated as 20-25% for vivax and 5-7% for falciparum malaria; (v) anopheline densities shown outdoors HBR values 5 to 10 fold higher than indoors and reach 10.000 bites/person/year; (vi) very high incidence observed in one of the surveyed localities was explained by a micro epidemic outbreak affecting visitors and temporary residents. Temporary residents living in tents or shacks are accessible to outdoors transmission. Seasonal fishermen were the main group at risk in the study and were responsible for a 2.6 fold increase in the malaria incidence in the locality. This situation illustrates the danger of extensive epidemic outbreaks when thousands of workers and secondary immigrant population will arrive attracted by opportunities opened by the Hydroelectric Power Plants constructions."
https://openalex.org/W2050207946,"The twin-arginine translocation (Tat) pathway is well known for its ability to export fully folded substrate proteins out of the cytoplasm of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. Studies of this mechanism in Escherichia coli have identified numerous transient protein-protein interactions that guide export-competent proteins through the Tat pathway. To visualize these interactions, we have adapted bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) to detect protein-protein interactions along the Tat pathway of living cells. Fragments of the yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) were fused to soluble and transmembrane factors that participate in the translocation process including Tat substrates, Tat-specific proofreading chaperones and the integral membrane proteins TatABC that form the translocase. Fluorescence analysis of these YFP chimeras revealed a wide range of interactions such as the one between the Tat substrate dimethyl sulfoxide reductase (DmsA) and its dedicated proofreading chaperone DmsD. In addition, BiFC analysis illuminated homo- and hetero-oligomeric complexes of the TatA, TatB and TatC integral membrane proteins that were consistent with the current model of translocase assembly. In the case of TatBC assemblies, we provide the first evidence that these complexes are co-localized at the cell poles. Finally, we used this BiFC approach to capture interactions between the putative Tat receptor complex formed by TatBC and the DmsA substrate or its dedicated chaperone DmsD. Our results demonstrate that BiFC is a powerful approach for studying cytoplasmic and inner membrane interactions underlying bacterial secretory pathways."

Meristems are small groups of cells that provide the microenvironment that allows stem cells to prosper. Homeostasis of a stem cell domain within a growing meristem is achieved by signalling between stem cells and surrounding cells. We have here simulated the origin and maintenance of a defined stem cell domain at the tip of Arabidopsis shoot meristems, based on the assumption that meristems are self-organizing systems. The model comprises two coupled feedback regulated genetic systems that control stem cell behaviour. Using a minimal set of spatial parameters, the mathematical model allows to predict the generation, shape and size of the stem cell domain, and the underlying organizing centre. We use the model to explore the parameter space that allows stem cell maintenance, and to simulate the consequences of mutations, gene misexpression and cell ablations."
https://openalex.org/W2006190843,"Fully differentiated mature smooth muscle cells (SMCs) are characterized by the presence of a unique repertoire of smooth muscle-specific proteins. Although previous studies have shown myocardin to be a critical transcription factor for stimulating expression of smooth muscle-specific genes, the mechanisms regulating myocardin activity are still poorly understood. We used a yeast two-hybrid screen with myocardin as bait to search for factors that may regulate the transcriptional activity of the myocardin. From this screen we identified a HECT domain-containing protein UBR5 (ubiquitin protein ligase E3 component n-recognin 5) as a myocardin-binding protein. Previous studies have shown that HECT domain-containing proteins are ubiquitin E3 ligases that play an important role in protein degradation. UBR5 has, however, also been shown to regulate transcription independent of its E3 ligase activity. In the current study we demonstrated that UBR5 localized in the nuclei of SMCs and forms a complex with myocardin in vivo and in vitro. We also show that UBR5 specifically enhanced trans-activation of smooth muscle-specific promoters by the myocardin family of proteins. In addition, UBR5 significantly augmented the ability of myocardin to induce expression of endogenous SMC marker genes independent on its E3 ligase function. Conversely, depletion of endogenous UBR5 by small interfering RNA in fibroblast cells attenuated myocardin-induced smooth muscle-specific gene expression, and UBR5 knockdown in SMCs resulted in down-regulation of smooth muscle-specific genes. Furthermore, we found that UBR5 can attenuate myocardin protein degradation resulting in increased myocardin protein expression without affecting myocardin mRNA expression. The effects of UBR5 on myocardin requires only the HECT and UBR1 domains of UBR5. This study reveals an unexpected role for the ubiquitin E3 ligase UBR5 as an activator of smooth muscle differentiation through its ability to stabilize myocardin protein."

Here, we addressed the role of FoxM1 in T cell development by generating and analyzing two different lines of T-cell specific FoxM1 deficient mice. As expected, FoxM1 is required for proliferation of early thymocytes and activated mature T cells. Defective expression of many cell cycle proteins was detected, including cyclin A, cyclin B1, cdc2, cdk2, p27 and the Rb family members p107 and p130 but surprisingly not survivin. Unexpectedly, loss of FoxM1 only affects a few cell cycle proteins in CD4+CD8+ thymocytes and has little effect on their sensitivity to apoptosis and the subsequent steps of T cell differentiation.

https://openalex.org/W2088645589,"To predict gene expressions is an important endeavour within computational systems biology. It can both be a way to explore how drugs affect the system, as well as providing a framework for finding which genes are interrelated in a certain process. A practical problem, however, is how to assess and discriminate among the various algorithms which have been developed for this purpose. Therefore, the DREAM project invited the year 2008 to a challenge for predicting gene expression values, and here we present the algorithm with best performance.We develop an algorithm by exploring various regression schemes with different model selection procedures. It turns out that the most effective scheme is based on least squares, with a penalty term of a recently developed form called the ""elastic net"". Key components in the algorithm are the integration of expression data from other experimental conditions than those presented for the challenge and the utilization of transcription factor binding data for guiding the inference process towards known interactions. Of importance is also a cross-validation procedure where each form of external data is used only to the extent it increases the expected performance.Our algorithm proves both the possibility to extract information from large-scale expression data concerning prediction of gene levels, as well as the benefits of integrating different data sources for improving the inference. We believe the former is an important message to those still hesitating on the possibilities for computational approaches, while the latter is part of an important way forward for the future development of the field of computational systems biology."
https://openalex.org/W2091869534,"We have recently reported that serotonin(4) (5-HT(4)) receptor agonists have a promising potential as fast-acting antidepressants. Here, we assess the extent to which this property may be optimized by the concomitant use of conventional antidepressants.We found that, in acute conditions, the 5-HT(4) agonist prucalopride was able to counteract the inhibitory effect of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) fluvoxamine and citalopram on 5-HT neuron impulse flow, in Dorsal Raphé Nucleus (DRN) cells selected for their high (>1.8 Hz) basal discharge. The co-administration of both prucalopride and RS 67333 with citalopram for 3 days elicited an enhancement of DRN 5-HT neuron average firing rate, very similar to what was observed with either 5-HT(4) agonist alone. At the postsynaptic level, this translated into the manifestation of a tonus on hippocampal postsynaptic 5-HT(1A) receptors, that was two to three times stronger when the 5-HT(4) agonist was combined with citalopram. Similarly, co-administration of citalopram synergistically potentiated the enhancing effect of RS 67333 on CREB protein phosphorylation within the hippocampus. Finally, in the Forced Swimming Test, the combination of RS 67333 with various SSRIs (fluvoxamine, citalopram and fluoxetine) was more effective to reduce time of immobility than the separate administration of each compound.These findings strongly suggest that the adjunction of an SSRI to a 5-HT(4) agonist may help to optimize the fast-acting antidepressant efficacy of the latter."
https://openalex.org/W2100190481,"Rho kinases (ROCKs) mediate cell contraction, local adhesion, and cell motility, which are considered to be important in cell differentiation. We postulated that ROCKs are involved in controlling embryonic stem (ES) cell renewal and differentiation.CCE, a murine ES cell, was treated with Y-27632 for 48 to 96 hours and colony formation was evaluated. Y-27632 blocked CCE colony formation and induced CCE to grow as individual cells, regardless of the initial seeding cell density either at 10(4)/cm(2) (""high"" seeding density) or 2x10(3)/cm(2) (""low"" density). However, at high seeding density, Y-27632-treated cells exhibited reduction of alkaline phosphatase (AP) staining and Oct3/4 expression. They expressed SOX-1, nestin, and MAP2c, but not betaIII-tubulin or NG-2. They did not express endoderm or mesoderm lineage markers. After removal of Y-27632, the cells failed to form colonies or regain undifferentiated state. Silencing of ROCK-1 or ROCK-2 with selective small interference RNA induced CCE morphological changes similar to Y-27632. Silencing of ROCK-1 or ROCK-2 individually was sufficient to cause reduction of AP and Oct3/4, and expression of SOX-1, nestin, and MAP2c; and combined silencing of both ROCKs did not augment the effects exerted by individual ROCK siRNA. Y-27632-treated CCE cells seeded at 2x10(3) or 6.6x10(3) cells/cm(2) did not lose renewal factors or express differentiation markers. Furthermore, they were able to form AP-positive colonies after removal of Y-27632 and reseeding. Similar to ROCK inhibition by Y-27632, silencing of ROCK-1 or ROCK-2 in cells seeded at 2x10(3)/cm(2) did not change renewal factors.We conclude that ROCKs promote ES cell colony formation, maintain them at undifferentiated state, and prevent them from neural differentiation at high seeding density. ROCK inhibition represents a new strategy for preparing large numbers of neural progenitor cells."
https://openalex.org/W2125358932,"Background Tissue invasion or tissue infiltration are clinical behaviors of a poor-prognosis subset of meningiomas. We carried out proteomic analyses of tissue extracts to discover new markers to accurately distinguish between infiltrative and noninfiltrative meningiomas. Methodology/Principal Findings Protein lysates of 64 different tissue samples (including two brain-invasive and 32 infiltrative tumors) were submitted to SELDI-TOF mass spectrometric analysis. Mass profiles were used to build up both unsupervised and supervised hierarchical clustering. One marker was found at high levels in noninvasive and noninfiltrative tumors and appeared to be a discriminative marker for clustering infiltrative and/or invasive meningiomas versus noninvasive meningiomas in two distinct subsets. Sensitivity and specificity were 86.7% and 100%, respectively. This marker was purified and identified as a multiphosphorylated form of vimentin, a cytoskeletal protein expressed in meningiomas. Conclusions/Significance Specific forms of vimentin can be surrogate molecular indicators of the invasive/infiltrative phenotype in tumors."

We examined age-dependent CD4+ T-cell functions in a wild-type (WT) and a transgenic mouse transplant model and analyzed the suppressive function of old regulatory T-cells. We found that splenocytes of naïve old B6 mice contained significantly higher frequencies of T-cells with an effector/memory phenotype (CD4+CD44highCD62Llow). However, in-vitro proliferation (MLR) and IFNγ-production (ELISPOT) were markedly reduced with increasing age. Likewise, skin graft rejection was significantly delayed in older recipients and fewer graft infiltrating CD4+T-cells were observed. Old CD4+ T-cells demonstrated a significant impaired responsiveness as indicated by diminished proliferation and activation. In contrast, old alloantigen-specific CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ T-cells demonstrated a dose-dependent well-preserved suppressor function. Next, we examined characteristics of 18-month old alloreactive T-cells in a transgenic adoptive transfer model. Adoptively transferred old T-cells proliferated significantly less in response to antigen. Skin graft rejection was significantly delayed in older recipients, and graft infiltrating cells were reduced. In summary, advanced recipient age was associated with delayed acute rejection and impaired CD4+ T-cell function and proliferation while CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ T-cells (Tregs) showed a well-preserved function."
https://openalex.org/W2028522023,"Lung surfactant reduces surface tension and maintains the stability of alveoli. How surfactant is released from alveolar epithelial type II cells is not fully understood. Vacuolar ATPase (V-ATPase) is the enzyme responsible for pumping H+ into lamellar bodies and is required for the processing of surfactant proteins and the packaging of surfactant lipids. However, its role in lung surfactant secretion is unknown. Proteomic analysis revealed that vacuolar ATPase (V-ATPase) dominated the alveolar type II cell lipid raft proteome. Western blotting confirmed the association of V-ATPase a1 and B1/2 subunits with lipid rafts and their enrichment in lamellar bodies. The dissipation of lamellar body pH gradient by Bafilomycin A1 (Baf A1), an inhibitor of V-ATPase, increased surfactant secretion. Baf A1-stimulated secretion was blocked by the intracellular Ca2+ chelator, BAPTA-AM, the protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor, staurosporine, and the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII), KN-62. Baf A1 induced Ca2+ release from isolated lamellar bodies. Thapsigargin reduced the Baf A1-induced secretion, indicating cross-talk between lamellar body and endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ pools. Stimulation of type II cells with surfactant secretagogues dissipated the pH gradient across lamellar bodies and disassembled the V-ATPase complex, indicating the physiological relevance of the V-ATPase-mediated surfactant secretion. Finally, silencing of V-ATPase a1 and B2 subunits decreased stimulated surfactant secretion, indicating that these subunits were crucial for surfactant secretion. We conclude that V-ATPase regulates surfactant secretion via an increased Ca2+ mobilization from lamellar bodies and endoplasmic reticulum, and the activation of PKC and CaMKII. Our finding revealed a previously unrealized role of V-ATPase in surfactant secretion."
https://openalex.org/W2068387678,"Plasmodium falciparum infected red blood cells (iRBC) express variant surface antigens (VSA) of which VAR2CSA is involved in placental sequestration and causes pregnancy-associated malaria (PAM). Primigravidae are most susceptible to PAM whereas antibodies associated with protection are often present at higher levels in multigravid women. However, HIV co-infection with malaria has been shown to alter this parity-dependent acquisition of immunity, with more severe symptoms as well as more malaria episodes in HIV positive women versus HIV negative women of a similar parity.Using VAR2CSA DBL-domains expressed on the surface of CHO-745 cells we quantified levels of DBL-domain specific IgG in sera from pregnant Malawian women by flow cytometry. Dissociations constants of DBL5epsilon specific antibodies were determined using a surface plasmon resonance technique, as an indication of antibody affinities.VAR2CSA DBL5epsilon was recognized in a gender and parity-dependent manner with anti-DBL5epsilon IgG correlating significantly with IgG levels to VSA-PAM on the iRBC surface. HIV positive women had lower levels of anti-DBL5epsilon IgG than HIV negative women of similar parity. In primigravidae, antibodies in HIV positive women also showed significantly lower affinity to VAR2CSA DBL5epsilon.Pregnant women from a malaria-endemic area had increased levels of anti-DBL5epsilon IgG by parity, indicating this domain of VAR2CSA to be a promising vaccine candidate against PAM. However, it is important to consider co-infection with HIV, as this seems to change the properties of antibody response against malaria. Understanding the characteristics of antibody response against VAR2CSA is undoubtedly imperative in order to design a functional and efficient vaccine against PAM."
https://openalex.org/W1990441661,"Background Rabex-5 is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) that specifically activates Rab5, i.e., converting Rab5-GDP to Rab5-GTP, through two distinct pathways to promote endosome fusion and endocytosis. The direct pathway involves a pool of membrane-associated Rabex-5 that targets to the membrane via an early endosomal targeting (EET) domain. The indirect pathway, on the other hand, involves a cytosolic pool of Rabex-5/Rabaptin-5 complex. The complex is recruited to the membrane via Rabaptin-5 binding to Rab5-GTP, suggesting a positive feedback mechanism. The relationship of these two pathways for Rab5 activation in the cell is unclear. Methodology/Principal Findings We dissect the relative contribution of each pathway to Rab5 activation via mathematical modeling and kinetic analysis in the cell. These studies show that the indirect pathway constitutes a positive feedback loop for converting Rab5-GDP to Rab5-GTP on the endosomal membrane and allows sensitive regulation of endosome fusion activity by the levels of Rab5 and Rabex-5 in the cell. The onset of this positive feedback effect, however, contains a threshold, which requires above endogenous levels of Rab5 or Rabex-5 in the cell. We term this novel phenomenon “delayed response”. The presence of the direct pathway reduces the delay by increasing the basal level of Rab5-GTP, thus facilitates the function of the Rabex-5/Rabaptin-5-mediated positive feedback loop. Conclusion Our data support the mathematical model. With the model's guidance, the data reveal the affinity of Rabex-5/Rabaptin-5/Rab5-GTP interaction in the cell, which is quantitatively related to the Rabex-5 concentration for the onset of the indirect positive feedback pathway. The presence of the direct pathway and increased Rab5 concentration can reduce the Rabex-5 concentration required for the onset of the positive feedback loop. Thus the direct and indirect pathways cooperate in the regulation of early endosome fusion."
https://openalex.org/W2124196544,"Background The implication of nitric oxide (NO) in the development of human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) using an animal model, was examined. The manner by which the trypanocidal activity of NO is impaired in the periphery and in the brain of rats infected with Trypanosoma brucei brucei (T. b. brucei) was analyzed through: (i) the changes occurring in NO concentration in both peripheral (blood) and cerebral compartments; (ii) the activity of nNOS and iNOS enzymes; (iii) identification of the brain cell types in which the NO-pathways are particularly active during the time-course of the infection. Methodology/Principal Findings NO concentration (direct measures by voltammetry) was determined in central (brain) and peripheral (blood) compartments in healthy and infected animals at various days post-infection: D5, D10, D16 and D22. Opposite changes were observed in the two compartments. NO production increased in the brain (hypothalamus) from D10 (+32%) to D16 (+71%), but decreased in the blood from D10 (−22%) to D16 (−46%) and D22 (−60%). In parallel with NO measures, cerebral iNOS activity increased and peaked significantly at D16 (up to +700%). However, nNOS activity did not vary. Immunohistochemical staining confirmed iNOS activation in several brain regions, particularly in the hypothalamus. In peritoneal macrophages, iNOS activity decreased from D10 (−83%) to D16 (−65%) and D22 (−74%) similarly to circulating NO. Conclusion/Significance The NO changes observed in our rat model were dependent on iNOS activity in both peripheral and central compartments. In the periphery, the NO production decrease may reflect an arginase-mediated synthesis of polyamines necessary to trypanosome growth. In the brain, the increased NO concentration may result from an enhanced activity of iNOS present in neurons and glial cells. It may be regarded as a marker of deleterious inflammatory reactions."

https://openalex.org/W2068087106,"The cytokine interleukin (IL)-21 exerts pleiotropic effects acting through innate as well as adaptive immune responses. The activities of IL-21 are mediated through binding to its cognate receptor complex composed of the IL-21 receptor private chain (IL-21Ralpha) and the common gamma-chain (gammaC), the latter being shared by IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL-9, and IL-15. The binding energy of the IL-21 ternary complex is predominantly provided by the high affinity interaction between IL-21 and IL-21Ralpha, whereas the interaction between IL-21 and gammaC, albeit essential for signaling, is rather weak. The design of IL-21 analogues, which have lost most or all affinity toward the signaling gammaC chain, while simultaneously maintaining a tight interaction with the private chain, would in theory represent candidates for IL-21 antagonists. We predicted the IL-21 residues, which compose the gammaC binding epitope using homology modeling and alignment with the related cytokines, IL-2 and IL-4. Next we systematically analyzed the predicted binding epitope by a mutagenesis study. Indeed two mutants, which have significantly impaired gammaC affinity with undiminished IL-21Ralpha affinity, were successfully identified. Functional studies confirmed that these two novel hIL-21 double mutants do act as hIL-21 antagonists."
https://openalex.org/W2071009357,"Background The importance of visual sense in Hymenopteran social behavior is suggested by the existence of a Hymenopteran insect-specific neural circuit related to visual processing and the fact that worker honeybee brain changes morphologically according to its foraging experience. To analyze molecular and neural bases that underlie the visual abilities of the honeybees, we used a cDNA microarray to search for gene(s) expressed in a neural cell-type preferential manner in a visual center of the honeybee brain, the optic lobes (OLs). Methodology/Principal Findings Expression analysis of candidate genes using in situ hybridization revealed two genes expressed in a neural cell-type preferential manner in the OLs. One is a homologue of Drosophila futsch, which encodes a microtubule-associated protein and is preferentially expressed in the monopolar cells in the lamina of the OLs. The gene for another microtubule-associated protein, tau, which functionally overlaps with futsch, was also preferentially expressed in the monopolar cells, strongly suggesting the functional importance of these two microtubule-associated proteins in monopolar cells. The other gene encoded a homologue of Misexpression Suppressor of Dominant-negative Kinase Suppressor of Ras 2 (MESK2), which might activate Ras/MAPK-signaling in Drosophila. MESK2 was expressed preferentially in a subclass of neurons located in the ventral region between the lamina and medulla neuropil in the OLs, suggesting that this subclass is a novel OL neuron type characterized by MESK2-expression. These three genes exhibited similar expression patterns in the worker, drone, and queen brains, suggesting that they function similarly irrespective of the honeybee sex or caste. Conclusions Here we identified genes that are expressed in a monopolar cell (Amfutsch and Amtau) or ventral medulla-preferential manner (AmMESK2) in insect OLs. These genes may aid in visualizing neurites of monopolar cells and ventral medulla cells, as well as in analyzing the function of these neurons."

Chem. 2003; 278: 27096-27104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), IGF-1, and epidermal growth factor) is associated with RS6K-mediated phosphorylation of FLNa at Ser2152, which inhibits FLNa cleavage, facilitates caveolin binding, and drives migration associated with Rac1 activation and lamellipodia formation (10Ravid D. Chuderland D. Landsman L. Lavie Y. Reich R. Liscovitch M. Exp. Cell Res. 2008; 314: 2762-2773Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 37Woo M.S. Ohta Y. Rabinovitz I. Stossel T.P. Blenis J. Mol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 11858-11864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In response to IGF-1, the caveolin 1-FLNa complexes contain p-Akt, and the pI3K inhibitor wortmannin blocks FLNa-caveolin interaction and prevents migration (10Ravid D. Chuderland D. Landsman L. Lavie Y. Reich R. Liscovitch M. Exp. Cell Res. 2008; 314: 2762-2773Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Although some migratory stimuli such as IGF-1 lead to formation of a Rac1-dependent, β-actin-rich leading lamella, other stimuli (e.g. IGFBP-5) induce migration characterized by cdc42-dependent filopodia formation (35Nobes C.D. Hall A. Cell. 1995; 81: 53-62Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3682) Google Scholar). In its GTP-bound, activated form, RalA binds FLNa (29Ohta Y. Suzuki N. Nakamura S. Hartwig J.H. Stossel T.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1999; 96: 2122-2128Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar), which elicits filopodia formation and recruits FLNa to these structures. Blockade of FLNa-RalA interaction prevents cdc42-dependent filopodia formation. Thus, FLNa-actin interactions are required for both forms of cell migration. FLNa is also associated with a variety of membrane receptors where the association can influence receptor retention in the membrane, recycling to the membrane, protection from or enhanced degradation, or receptor signaling. FLNa binds to FcγR1, which enhances retention in the cell membrane by preventing targeting to lysosomes (39Beekman J.M. van der Poel C.E. van der Linden J.A. van den Berg D.L. van den Berghe P.V. van de Winkel J.G. Leusen J.H. J. Immunol. 2008; 180: 3938-3945Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Upon receptor ligation, the two dissociate. With bradykinin activation in endothelial cells, FLNa plays a role in receptor internalization and recycling to the membrane (24Anilkumar G. Rajasekaran S.A. Wang S. Hankinson O. Bander N.H. Rajasekaran A.K. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 2645-2648PubMed Google Scholar). When calcium-sensing receptor binding to hinge 1 and repeats 15–17 of FLNa is disrupted, calcium-sensing receptor-mediated signaling to extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) or c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) are impaired, and Rho activation, which is required for inhibition of parathyroid hormone, does not occur (40Awata H. Huang C. Handlogten M.E. Miller R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34871-34879Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 41Huang C. Wu Z. Hujer K.M. Miller R.T.

In these examples, activation of membrane receptors involves signal transduction cascades that lead to phosphorylation of FLNa, which inhibits its cleavage and facilitates membrane reorganization, thereby allowing receptor recycling. In other instances, cellular activation leads to dephosphorylation of Ser2152 upon FLNa rendering the molecule susceptible to calpain cleavage (43Vadlamudi R.K. Li F. Adam L. Nguyen D. Ohta Y. Stossel T.P. Kumar R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 681-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). When FLNa is cleaved, the C-terminal fragment can bind activated factors such as phospho-Smad (25Sasaki A. Masuda Y. Ohta Y. Ikeda K. Watanabe K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17871-17877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) and translocates to the nucleus enhancing transforming growth factor β-mediated responses. Binding of the C-terminal fragment of FLNa to the cytoplasmic androgen receptor facilitates nuclear translocation and modulates the responses of androgen target genes (22Loy C.J. Sim K.S. Yong E.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 4562-4567Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 44Müller J.M. Isele U. Metzger E. Rempel A. Moser M. Pscherer A. Breyer T. Holubarsch C. Buettner R.

Biol. 2004; 92: 265-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). FLNa binding is required for androgen-mediated stimulation of cell proliferation, and the loss of cleavable FLNa plays a role in the development of androgen independence in prostate cancer (46Wang Y. Kreisberg J.I. Bedolla R.G. Mikhailova M. deVere White R.W. Ghosh P.M. Oncogene. 2007; 26: 6061-6070Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Transcriptional activity of the transcription factor FOXC1 is also modulated by intranuclear binding to FLNa (47Berry F.B. O'Neill M.A. Coca-Prados M. Walter M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 1415-1424Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). These studies highlight the importance of FLNa cleavage and intranuclear effects of FLNa, yet the breadth of nuclear effects of FLNa remains to be examined. Previously, we showed that IGFBP-5 induces migration in glomerular mesangial cells, a pericyte-like, vascular smooth muscle cell (7Abrass C.K. Berfield A.K. Andress D.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: F899-F906PubMed Google Scholar, 48Berfield A.K. Andress D.L. Abrass C.K. Kidney Int. 2000; 57: 1991-2003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). IGFBP-5-induced migration requires cdc42 activation and attachment to laminin 421 via a α6-containing integrin (48Berfield A.K. Andress D.L. Abrass C.K. Kidney Int. 2000; 57: 1991-2003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Treatment with IGFBP-5 also induces transcription of the laminin subunits (α4β2γ1) that compose laminin 421 (49Berfield A.K. Hansen K.M. Abrass C.K. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2006; 291: C589-C599Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Each of these effects can be induced by intact IGFBP-5 or the heparin-binding peptide IGFBP-5201–218, but they cannot be duplicated with the N-terminal IGFBP-51–169, IGFBP-3, IGFBP-4, or IGF-1. The effects of IGFBP-5 on laminin 421 expression are of particular interest because of the role of this laminin isoform in control of angiogenesis and stabilization during microvessel maturation (50Khazenzon N.M. Ljubimov A.V. Lakhter A.J. Fujita M. Fujiwara H. Sekiguchi K. Sorokin L.M. Petäjäniemi N. Virtanen I. Black K.L. Ljubimova J.Y. Mol. Cancer Ther. 2003; 2: 985-994PubMed Google Scholar), functions that also influence metastatic potential of cancers (51Sprenger C.C. Drivdahl R.H. Woodke L.B. Eyman D. Reed M.J. Carter W.G. Plymate S.R. Neoplasia. 2008; 10: 1350-1361Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). During studies of IGFBP-5-induced migration, we noted that FLNa reorganized with the cytoskeleton as expected, but IGFBP-5 also led to nuclear accumulation of FLNa. This report details the studies that were undertaken to investigate the role of IGFBP-5 in nuclear accumulation of FLNa and its role in mediating the increased transcription of laminin γ1. The following reagents were obtained from the designated suppliers: intact IGFBP-5 (Abcam, Cambridge, MA); IGFBP-5 peptide (amino acids 201–218, RKGFYKRKQCPKSRGRKR) (Sigma); pcDNA3.1/NT-GFP-TOPO-TA and the control vector pcDNA3.1/NT-GFP (Invitrogen); DAPI and phalloidin (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR); fluoromount (Southern Biotechnology, Birmingham, AL); antibodies to α-actinin, epidermal growth factor receptor, and β-actin (Sigma); TFIIB (Transduction Laboratories, Franklin Lakes, NJ); and goat anti-human phospho-Smad2/3 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). Antibodies to FLNa included goat anti-chicken gizzard FLNa (Sigma), polyclonal rabbit antibody to a COOH peptide fragment (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), NH3 peptide fragment (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), human FLNa, and phosphoserine 2113 and 2152 (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA). Polyclonal rabbit antibody to C-terminal repeat 24 was kindly provided by Dr. R. Tyler Miller (Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH). Peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG was from Pierce, and Alexa Fluor 488 and 568 antibodies to mouse, goat, and rabbit IgG were from Molecular Probes. Rat glomerular mesangial cells (MC) were prepared by modification (52Abrass C.K. Spicer D. Raugi G.J. Kidney Int. 1995; 47: 25-37Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 53Abrass C.K. Spicer D. Raugi G.J. Kidney Int. 1994; 46: 613-620Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) of routine methods (54Kreisberg J.I. Karnovsky M.J. Kidney Int. 1983; 23: 439-447Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). In brief, minced rat kidney cortex was sieved. Isolated glomeruli were plated in medium containing a 1:1 mix of 20% FCS-RPMI 1640 and previously collected glomerular conditioned medium. MC outgrowths were harvested and passed in this medium for an additional week, after which the conditioned medium was omitted. MC were cloned and studied at passages 8–12. Supplemental insulin routinely added to MC cultures was omitted. MC are vascular smooth muscle-like cells analogous to microvascular pericytes or mural cells. For microscopic analysis cells (2 × 104) were plated in glass chamber slides (Nunc, Rochester NY), grown for 24 h in 20% FCS-RPMI medium, and growth-arrested in 2% FCS-RPMI for 48 h. The cells were treated with IGFBP-5201–218 (30 μg/ml) or intact IGFBP-5 (100 nm) and examined at the times noted in the results. The cells were fixed and examined by light, standard immunofluorescence, and confocal microscopy. Chamber slides were rinsed in PBS and fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde for 20 min. After rinsing in PBS, the cells were permeabilized with 0.05% Triton X-100 for 3 min and rinsed three times in PBS. The slides were incubated with primary antibody for 20 min at room temperature, rinsed, and incubated with fluorescein-conjugated secondary antibody for an additional 20 min. Controls included the nonimmune IgG and the secondary antibody alone. Two different antigens were visualized by using Alexafluor 488-conjugated as well as Alexafluor 568-conjugated secondary antibody. F-actin was visualized with phalloidin staining, and nuclei were visualized with DAPI. All of the slides were mounted in Fluoromount and observed with a Leitz microscope equipped for epi-illumination or a Leica TCS-SP confocal microscope. The scanned images collected in the sequential xy series were acquired at 400× magnification. The digital images were exported to Adobe Photoshop for further processing. MC were plated in 75-cm2 culture flasks, grown to near confluency, and growth-arrested in 2% FCS-RPMI medium for 48 h. Some flasks were treated with IGFBP-5201–218(30 μg/ml) for the times indicated in the results, rinsed, and harvested with cell lysis buffer. The cell lysates were prepared by three different methods: 1) whole cell lysates were prepared by treating cells with PBS containing 0.1% SDS, 0.5% Triton X-100, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pepstatin A (20 μg/ml), aprotinin (10 μg/ml), and leupeptin (10 μg/ml); 2) nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions were prepared as described in Ref. 46Wang Y. Kreisberg J.I. Bedolla R.G. Mikhailova M. deVere White R.W. Ghosh P.M. Oncogene. 2007; 26: 6061-6070Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar by first extracting with 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 10% Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml each leupeptin, aprotinin, and pepstatin A) followed by extraction of the nuclear pellet with 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 0.4 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol containing the same protease inhibitors; and 3) differential detergent fractionation was performed as described (33Wang Q. Patton W.F. Chiang E.T. Hechtman H.B. Shepro D. J. Cell. Biochem. 1996; 62: 383-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Untreated or IGFBP-5201–218-treated cells were grown in 75-cm2 flasks. At the designated times the cells were rinsed with PBS and extracted in ice-cold digitonin buffer (0.01% digitonin, 10 mm PIPES, 300 mm sucrose, 100 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 10 μg/ml phalloidin, and protease inhibitors). Following incubation on ice for 10 min, the supernatant was collected (cytosolic fraction). The remaining cell components were sequentially incubated for 30 min at room temperature in a Triton solution (0.5% Triton X-100, 10 mm PIPES, 300 mm sucrose, 100 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 3 mm EGTA, protease inhibitors, and 10 μg of phalloidin) to extract the membrane/organelle fraction. The residual cell material was extracted on ice for 10 min with a Tween 40/deoxycholate buffer (1% Tween 40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 10 mm PIPES, protease inhibitors), and the supernatant was collected (nuclear fraction). Hot (100 °C) SDS buffer (2.5% SDS in 10 mm Tris-HCl, 200 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors) was added to the dish and then incubated on ice for 5 min. The cytoskeletal fraction is collected and heated at 100 °C for 5 min. All of the cellular fractions were acetone-precipitated, dissolved in equal volumes of sample buffer, subjected to electrophoresis under reducing conditions in 5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, transferred to nitrocellulose, and incubated with polyclonal goat anti-FLNa. The FLNa bands within each lane were analyzed on Kodak EDAS 290. Fraction purity was monitored by staining by Western blot using antibodies to α-actinin (cytoskeletal protein), epidermal growth factor receptor (membrane protein), β-actin (cytosolic protein), and TFIIB (nuclear protein). The protein amounts were determined by Bradford colorimetric assay. For immunoprecipitation, equal amounts of protein were incubated with antibodies overnight at 4 °C followed by incubation with protein A/G-Sepharose (GE Healthcare) for 2 h. The resulting complexes were washed with PBS containing 0.1% SDS and 0.5% Triton X-100. For Westerns blots, the proteins were separated on 10% SDS-PAGE gels and immunoblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes. Processed membranes were incubated with primary antibodies, exposed to Super Signal chemiluminesence reagents (Pierce) and developed on Kodak X-Omat LS. Image analysis was done using a Kodak EDAS 290 system. 0.5 μg of total RNA prepared using RNAqueous®-4PCR (Ambion, Austin, TX) was used per reverse transcription-PCR. An aliquot of the resulting cDNA generated for each condition was used for amplification of laminin γ1 (lamc1) and gapdh. Primers for lamc1 included a sense primer (5′-GTTACGGGCAGAACCTCTCA) and an antisense primer (5′-GTTACGGGCAGAACCTCTCA), and the primers for gapdh were purchased (Qiagen). Real time PCR was preformed using SYBR® green SensiMix dT (Quantace, Norwood, MA) processed in an ABI 7900HT PCR machine. A GFP-tagged C-terminal FLNa (GFP-cFLNa) construct was prepared for transfection into MC. A C-terminal fragment (nucleic acids 5285–8122) of human FLNa (X53416) was made using pREP4 FLNa vector (a gift from Dr. T. Stossel, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA) and the following primers: CFilF (5′-GAC GGC ACT TTC GAC ATC TTC) and CFilR (5′-CCA GAC TCA GGG CAC CAC A). The inserts were prepared by PCR using AccuPrime Pfx DNA polymerase (Invitrogen) and gel-purified, and 3′A overhangs were added with Taq DNA polymerase. TA TOPO cloning of inserts into pcDNA3.1/NT-GFP vector (Invitrogen) was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cloning reaction was transformed into One Shot TOP10 Escherichia coli (Invitrogen). Multiple clones were screened by PCR using GFP vector sequencing primers provided with the vector. Clones containing inserts of the correct size were sequenced. MC were transfected with GFP-cFLNa or an empty GFP vector using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) and growth-arrested in 2% FCS-RPMI medium for 48 h. The cells were treated with IGFBP-5201–218(30 μg/ml) for the times indicated in the results. StealthTM siRNA sequences derived from human FLNa sequence NM_001456 were as follows: F2 duplex, 5′-AAUACUCGAAGCCAUACACGCCAUC and 3′-UUAUGAGCUUCGGUAUGUGCGGUAG; F3 duplex, 5′-UAUCCAUGCAGGACAUCUUGGCCUC and 3′-AUAGGUACGUCCUGUAGAACCGGAG; and F4 duplex, 5′-UUAGGUGGGACAUACGCAUGGAGUC and 3′-AAUCCACCCUGUAUGCGUACCUCAG (Invitrogen). MC were transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 and siRNA at final concentrations of 0.5–0.1 μm. RNA and protein measurements were made 24–48 h post-transfection. The cells treated with IGFBP-5201–218 (30 μg/ml) were growth-arrested in 2% FCS-RPMI medium for 48 h prior to treatment. ChIP assay was performed as described (55Nelson J.D. Denisenko O. Bomsztyk K. Nat. Protoc. 2006; 1: 179-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). 3 × 106 cells were treated with or without IGFBP-5201–218 for 4 h, formaldehyde-cross-linked, sonicated, and immunoprecipitated with antibody to FLNa, and phenol/chloroform-purified DNA was subjected to PCR. PCR analysis included primers for lamc1 (sense primer, 5′-AGGACATCAAGAAGACACTACCCAAC, and antisense primer, 5′-CTACCAACGTCTAATGACCAATACC) and Hba (a gene not expressed in MC; sense primer, 5′-AGGCCAATCTTGAGTTCATTC, and antisense primer, 5′- GTCTCAGTGCCAATGGGCTC). Controls included nonimmune IgG. Group means were compared by one-way analysis of variance with subgroup testing by contrasts. p < 0.05 was considered significant. Previously we showed that IGFBP-5 induces MC to change phenotype and migrate (48Berfield A.K. Andress D.L. Abrass C.K. Kidney Int. 2000; 57: 1991-2003Abstract Full Text"
https://openalex.org/W2081212299,"Background Two previous articles proposed an explicit model of how the brain processes information by its organization of synaptic connections. The family of logic circuits was shown to generate neural correlates of complex psychophysical phenomena in different sensory systems. Methodology/Principal Findings Here it is shown that the most cost-effective architectures for these networks produce correlates of electrophysiological brain phenomena and predict major aspects of the anatomical structure and physiological organization of the neocortex. The logic circuits are markedly efficient in several respects and provide the foundation for all of the brain's combinational processing of information. Conclusions/Significance At the local level, these networks account for much of the physical structure of the neocortex as well its organization of synaptic connections. Electronic implementations of the logic circuits may be more efficient than current electronic logic arrays in generating both Boolean and fuzzy logic."

Science Podcast : [This week's show [MP3]][7] includes a segment on the Visualization Challenge

Sometimes scientific information can be vividly represented with commonplace materials. Take the illustration on the cover of this issue of Science . It is a three-dimensional art installation made from 75,000 cable zip ties depicting the dynamic relationships between endothelial cells and their surrounding microenvironment. Or turn to page 950 for a description of how cotton batting, a clothesline, and sewing pins are used in a video to illustrate the impact of the environment on gene expression. The sculpture and video are among the awardees in this year's International Science & Engineering Visualization Challenge.

Clearly, the convergence of art and science can successfully convey complex phenomena in spectacular ways.

For the past 7 years, Science and the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) have co-sponsored annual challenges to promote cutting-edge efforts to visualize scientific data, principles, and findings. The visualization challenge is intended to showcase and encourage this kind of work.

This year's entries present a bold and unique look at life, from the broad view of planet Earth, to a more intimate picture of activity inside the human brain. We received 130 entries from 14 countries, 23 U.S. states, and the District of Columbia. A committee of staff members from Science and NSF screened the entries, and an outside panel of experts in scientific visualization reviewed the finalists and selected the winners. The winning entries appear on the following pages.

We encourage you to submit applications for next year's challenge, details of which will be available at [www.nsf.gov/news/scivis][8], and to join us in celebrating this year's winners.

Tarri Joyner of NSF organized this year's challenge. Michael Torrice of Science 's news staff wrote the text that accompanies the images in this special section, and Martyn Green, Tara Marathe, and Andrew Whitesell put together a special Web presentation at [www.sciencemag.org/special/vis2009/][9].
