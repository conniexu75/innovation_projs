https://openalex.org/W1969620000,"Human cooperation is a key driving force behind the evolutionary success of our hominin lineage. At the proximate level, biologists and social scientists have identified other-regarding preferences--such as fairness based on egalitarian motives, and altruism--as likely candidates for fostering large-scale cooperation. A critical question concerns the ontogenetic origins of these constituents of cooperative behavior, as well as whether they emerge independently or in an interrelated fashion. The answer to this question will shed light on the interdisciplinary debate regarding the significance of such preferences for explaining how humans become such cooperative beings. We investigated 15-month-old infants' sensitivity to fairness, and their altruistic behavior, assessed via infants' reactions to a third-party resource distribution task, and via a sharing task. Our results challenge current models of the development of fairness and altruism in two ways. First, in contrast to past work suggesting that fairness and altruism may not emerge until early to mid-childhood, 15-month-old infants are sensitive to fairness and can engage in altruistic sharing. Second, infants' degree of sensitivity to fairness as a third-party observer was related to whether they shared toys altruistically or selfishly, indicating that moral evaluations and prosocial behavior are heavily interconnected from early in development. Our results present the first evidence that the roots of a basic sense of fairness and altruism can be found in infancy, and that these other-regarding preferences develop in a parallel and interwoven fashion. These findings support arguments for an evolutionary basis--most likely in dialectical manner including both biological and cultural mechanisms--of human egalitarianism given the rapidly developing nature of other-regarding preferences and their role in the evolution of human-specific forms of cooperation. Future work of this kind will help determine to what extent uniquely human sociality and morality depend on other-regarding preferences emerging early in life."

https://openalex.org/W2067901314,"miRNAs were recently implicated in the pathogenesis of numerous diseases, including neurological disorders such as Parkinson's disease (PD). miRNAs are abundant in the nervous system, essential for efficient brain function and play important roles in neuronal patterning and cell specification. To further investigate their involvement in the etiology of PD, we conducted miRNA expression profiling in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of 19 patients and 13 controls using microarrays. We found 18 miRNAs differentially expressed, and pathway analysis of 662 predicted target genes of 11 of these miRNAs revealed an over-representation in pathways previously linked to PD as well as novel pathways. To narrow down the genes for further investigations, we undertook a parallel approach using chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing (ChIP-seq) analysis to uncover genome-wide interactions of α-synuclein, a molecule with a central role in both monogenic and idiopathic PD. Convergence of ChIP-seq and miRNomics data highlighted the glycosphingolipid biosynthesis and the ubiquitin proteasome system as key players in PD. We then tested the association of target genes belonging to these pathways with PD risk, and identified nine SNPs in USP37 consistently associated with PD susceptibility in three genome-wide association studies (GWAS) datasets (0.46≤OR≤0.63) and highly significant in the meta-dataset (3.36×10−4<p<1.94×10−3). A SNP in ST8SIA4 was also highly associated with PD (p = 6.15×10−3) in the meta-dataset. These findings suggest that several miRNAs may act as regulators of both known and novel biological processes leading to idiopathic PD."
https://openalex.org/W2060995023,"The changes in phytate, phytase activity and in vitro bioavailability of iron and zinc during soaking and germination of three white sorghum varieties (Sorghum bicolor L. Moench), named Dorado, Shandweel-6, and Giza-15 were investigated. Sorghum varieties were soaked for 20 h and germinated for 72 h after soaking for 20 h to reduce phytate content and increase iron and zinc in vitro bioavailability. The results revealed that iron and zinc content was significantly reduced from 28.16 to 32.16% and 13.78 to 26.69% for soaking treatment and 38.43 to 39.18% and 21.80 to 31.27% for germination treatments, respectively. Phytate content was significantly reduced from 23.59 to 32.40% for soaking treatment and 24.92 to 35.27% for germination treatments, respectively. Phytase enzymes will be activated during drying in equal form in all varieties. The results proved that the main distinct point is the change of phytase activity as well as specific activity during different treatment which showed no significant differences between the varieties used. The in vitro bioavailability of iron and zinc were significantly improved as a result of soaking and germination treatments."
https://openalex.org/W2092871280,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) afflicts around 20 million people worldwide and so there is an urgent need for effective treatment. Our research showing that herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV1) is a risk factor for AD for the brains of people who possess a specific genetic factor and that the virus causes accumulation of key AD proteins (β-amyloid (Aβ) and abnormally phosphorylated tau (P-tau)), suggests that anti-HSV1 antiviral agents might slow AD progression. However, currently available antiviral agents target HSV1 DNA replication and so might be successful in AD only if Aβ and P-tau accumulation depend on viral DNA replication. Therefore, we investigated firstly the stage(s) of the virus replication cycle required for Aβ and P-tau accumulation, and secondly whether antiviral agents prevent these changes using recombinant strains of HSV1 that progress only partly through the replication cycle and antiviral agents that inhibit HSV1 DNA replication. By quantitative immunocytochemistry we demonstrated that entry, fusion and uncoating of HSV1, are insufficient to induce Aβ and P-tau production. We showed also that none of the “immediate early” viral proteins is directly responsible, and that Aβ and P-tau are produced at a subsequent stage of the HSV1 replication cycle. Importantly, the anti-HSV1 antiviral agents acyclovir, penciclovir and foscarnet reduced Aβ and P-tau accumulation, as well as HSV1, with foscarnet being less effective in each case. P-tau accumulation was found to depend on HSV1 DNA replication, whereas Aβ accumulation was not. The antiviral-induced decrease in Aβ is attributable to the reduced number of new viruses, and hence the reduction in viral spread. Since antiviral agents reduce greatly Aβ and P-tau accumulation in HSV1-infected cells, they would be suitable for treating AD with great advantage unlike current AD therapies, only the virus, not the host cell, would be targeted."
https://openalex.org/W2019397350,"Gephyrin is the major protein determinant for the clustering of inhibitory neurotransmitter receptors. Earlier analyses revealed that gephyrin tightly binds to residues 398-410 of the glycine receptor β subunit (GlyR β) and, as demonstrated only recently, also interacts with GABA(A) receptors (GABA(A)Rs) containing the α1, α2, and α3 subunits. Here, we dissect the molecular basis underlying the interactions between gephyrin and GABA(A)Rs containing these α-subunits and compare them to the crystal structure of the gephyrin-GlyR β complex. Biophysical and biochemical assays revealed that, in contrast to its tight interaction with GlyR β, gephyrin only loosely interacts with GABA(A)R α2, whereas it has an intermediate affinity for the GABA(A)R α1 and α3 subunits. Despite the wide variation in affinities and the low overall sequence homology among the identified receptor subunits, competition assays confirmed the receptor-gephyrin interaction to be a mutually exclusive process. Selected gephyrin point mutants that critically weaken complex formation with GlyR β also abolished the GABA(A)R α1 and α3 interactions. Additionally, we identified a common binding motif with two conserved aromatic residues that are central for gephyrin binding. Consistent with the biochemical data, mutations of the corresponding residues within the cytoplasmic domain of α2 subunit-containing GABA(A)Rs attenuated clustering of these receptors at postsynaptic sites in hippocampal neurons. Taken together, our experiments provide key insights regarding similarities and differences in the complex formation between gephyrin and GABA(A)Rs compared with GlyRs and, hence, the accumulation of these receptors at postsynaptic sites."

We demonstrate that endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated degradation (ERAD) prevents native folding of mutated lysosomal enzymes in patient-derived fibroblasts from two clinically distinct lysosomal storage disorders, namely Gaucher and Tay-Sachs disease. Prolonging ER retention via ERAD inhibition enhanced folding, trafficking, and activity of these unstable enzyme variants. Furthermore, combining ERAD inhibition with enhancement of the cellular folding capacity via proteostasis modulation resulted in synergistic rescue of mutated enzymes. ERAD inhibition was achieved by cell treatment with small molecules that interfere with recognition (kifunensine) or retrotranslocation (eeyarestatin I) of misfolded substrates. These different mechanisms of ERAD inhibition were shown to enhance ER retention of mutated proteins but were associated with dramatically different levels of ER stress, unfolded protein response activation, and unfolded protein response-induced apoptosis.

https://openalex.org/W2027976516,"Although strong exposure to arsenic has been shown to be carcinogenic, its contribution to lung cancer incidence in the United States is not well characterized. We sought to determine if the low-level exposures to arsenic seen in the U.S. are associated with lung cancer incidence after controlling for possible confounders, and to assess the interaction with smoking behavior.Measurements of arsenic stream sediment and soil concentration obtained from the USGS National Geochemical Survey were combined, respectively, with 2008 BRFSS estimates on smoking prevalence and 2000 U.S. Census county level income to determine the effects of these factors on lung cancer incidence, as estimated from respective state-wide cancer registries and the SEER database. Poisson regression was used to determine the association between each variable and age-adjusted county-level lung cancer incidence. ANOVA was used to assess interaction effects between covariates.Sediment levels of arsenic were significantly associated with an increase in incident cases of lung cancer (P<0.0001). These effects persisted after controlling for smoking and income (P<0.0001). Across the U.S., exposure to arsenic may contribute to up to 5,297 lung cancer cases per year. There was also a significant interaction between arsenic exposure levels and smoking prevalence (P<0.05).Arsenic was significantly associated with lung cancer incidence rates in the U.S. after controlling for smoking and income, indicating that low-level exposure to arsenic is responsible for excess cancer cases in many parts of the U.S. Elevated county smoking prevalence strengthened the association between arsenic exposure and lung cancer incidence rate, an effect previously unseen on a population level."
https://openalex.org/W2148661138,"The nasopharyngeal commensal bacteria Streptococcus pneumoniae is also a frequent cause of serious infections. Nasopharyngeal colonisation with S. pneumoniae inhibits subsequent re-colonisation by inducing Th17-cell adaptive responses, whereas vaccination prevents invasive infections by inducing antibodies to S. pneumoniae capsular polysaccharides. In contrast, protection against invasive infection after nasopharyngeal colonisation with mutant S. pneumoniae strains was associated with antibody responses to protein antigens. The role of colonisation-induced Th17-cell responses during subsequent invasive infections is unknown. Using mouse models, we show that previous colonisation with S. pneumoniae protects against subsequent lethal pneumonia mainly by preventing bacteraemia with a more modest effect on local control of infection within the lung. Previous colonisation resulted in CD4-dependent increased levels of Th17-cell cytokines during subsequent infectious challenge. However, mice depleted of CD4 cells prior to challenge remained protected against bacteraemia, whereas no protection was seen in antibody deficient mice and similar protection could be achieved through passive transfer of serum. Serum from colonised mice but not antibody deficient mice promoted phagocytosis of S. pneumoniae, and previously colonised mice were able to rapidly clear S. pneumoniae from the blood after intravenous inoculation. Thus, despite priming for a Th17-cell response during subsequent infection, the protective effects of prior colonisation in this model was not dependent on CD4 cells but on rapid clearance of bacteria from the blood by antibody-mediated phagocytosis. These data suggest that whilst nasopharyngeal colonisation induces a range of immune responses, the effective protective responses depend upon the site of subsequent infection."
https://openalex.org/W1981004209,"Interferon regulatory factor (IRF) 8 and IRF4 are structurally-related, hematopoietic cell-specific transcription factors that cooperatively regulate the differentiation of dendritic cells and B cells. Whilst in myeloid cells IRF8 is known to modulate growth and differentiation, the role of IRF4 is poorly understood. In this study, we show that IRF4 has activities similar to IRF8 in regulating myeloid cell development. The ectopic expression of IRF4 in myeloid progenitor cells in vitro inhibits cell growth, promotes macrophages, but hinders granulocytic cell differentiation. We also show that IRF4 binds to and activates transcription through the IRF-Ets composite sequence (IECS). Furthermore, we demonstrate that Irf8-/-Irf4-/- mice exhibit a more severe chronic myeloid leukemia (CML)-like disease than Irf8-/- mice, involving a disproportionate expansion of granulocytes at the expense of monocytes/macrophages. Irf4-/- mice, however, display no obvious abnormality in myeloid cell development, presumably because IRF4 is expressed at a much lower level than IRF8 in granulocyte-macrophage progenitors. Our results also suggest that IRF8 and IRF4 have not only common but also specific activities in myeloid cells. Since the expression of both the IRF8 and IRF4 genes is downregulated in CML patients, these results may add to our understanding of CML pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1970855368,"A protective malaria vaccine will likely need to elicit both cell-mediated and antibody responses. As adenovirus vaccine vectors induce both these responses in humans, a Phase 1/2a clinical trial was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of an adenovirus serotype 5-vectored malaria vaccine against sporozoite challenge.NMRC-MV-Ad-PfC is an adenovirus vector encoding the Plasmodium falciparum 3D7 circumsporozoite protein (CSP). It is one component of a two-component vaccine NMRC-M3V-Ad-PfCA consisting of one adenovector encoding CSP and one encoding apical membrane antigen-1 (AMA1) that was evaluated for safety and immunogenicity in an earlier study (see companion paper, Sedegah et al). Fourteen Ad5 seropositive or negative adults received two doses of NMRC-MV-Ad-PfC sixteen weeks apart, at 1 x 1010 particle units per dose. The vaccine was safe and well tolerated. All volunteers developed positive ELISpot responses by 28 days after the first immunization (geometric mean 272 spot forming cells/million[sfc/m]) that declined during the following 16 weeks and increased after the second dose to levels that in most cases were less than the initial peak (geometric mean 119 sfc/m). CD8+ predominated over CD4+ responses, as in the first clinical trial. Antibody responses were poor and like ELISpot responses increased after the second immunization but did not exceed the initial peak. Pre-existing neutralizing antibodies (NAb) to Ad5 did not affect the immunogenicity of the first dose, but the fold increase in NAb induced by the first dose was significantly associated with poorer antibody responses after the second dose, while ELISpot responses remained unaffected. When challenged by the bite of P. falciparum-infected mosquitoes, two of 11 volunteers showed a delay in the time to patency compared to infectivity controls, but no volunteers were sterilely protected.The NMRC-MV-Ad-PfC vaccine expressing CSP was safe and well tolerated given as two doses, but did not provide sterile protection.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00392015."
https://openalex.org/W2046089352,"Autotransporters are a superfamily of virulence factors typified by a channel-forming C terminus that facilitates translocation of the functional N-terminal passenger domain across the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria. This final step in the secretion of autotransporters requires a translocation-competent conformation for the passenger domain that differs markedly from the structure of the fully folded secreted protein. The nature of the translocation-competent conformation remains controversial, in particular whether the passenger domain can adopt secondary structural motifs, such as disulfide-bonded segments, while maintaining a secretion-competent state. Here, we used the endogenous and closely spaced cysteine residues of the plasmid-encoded toxin (Pet) from enteroaggregative Escherichia coli to investigate the effect of disulfide bond-induced folding on translocation of an autotransporter passenger domain. We reveal that rigid structural elements within disulfide-bonded segments are resistant to autotransporter-mediated secretion. We define the size limit of disulfide-bonded segments tolerated by the autotransporter system demonstrating that, when present, cysteine pairs are intrinsically closely spaced to prevent congestion of the translocator pore by large disulfide-bonded regions.

These latter data strongly support the hairpin mode of autotransporter biogenesis. Gram-negative bacteria possess seven secretion pathways (numbered I–VI and the chaperone-usher pathway) that facilitate navigation of secreted proteins through the inner membrane, periplasm, and outer membrane (OM). 2The abbreviations used are: OMouter membraneOMPouter membrane proteinATautotransporterBAMβ-barrel assembly machineryPetplasmid-encoded toxinD2Adomain-2Aβ-MEβ-mercaptoethanolBis-Tris2-(bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino)-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diolTCEPtris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphinemPEG-MalmPEG-maleimide. These pathways generally use specialized machineries that span the width of the cell envelope and that differ in complexity, structural features, and mechanism of protein translocation. At first glance, the simplicity of the type Va secretion pathway appeared to be the exception; all the functional elements required for secretion appeared to be contained within a single protein with the N-terminal signal peptide mediating inner membrane translocation, the central passenger domain being the secreted functional moiety, and the C terminus forming a β-barrel structure in the OM, the latter element being essential for passenger domain translocation to the bacterial cell surface. Accordingly, the superfamily of proteins that exploit this pathway for their delivery to the surface of Gram-negative bacteria was termed autotransporters (ATs) (1Pohlner J. Halter R. Beyreuther K.

These dichotomous sets of studies have given rise to two mechanistic models of AT biogenesis, one proposing that passenger domain translocation occurs through a folded AT β-barrel pore, and the other proposing BamA as an accessory factor mediating passenger translocation before the β-domain adopts a final folded conformation. Here, we used the plasmid-encoded toxin (Pet), a prototypical member of the serine protease ATs of the Enterobacteriaceae (SPATEs) (37Eslava C. Navarro-García F. Czeczulin J.R. Henderson I.R. Cravioto A. Nataro J.P. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 3155-3163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), to ascertain the tolerance for folded elements during OM translocation. Pet possesses a pair of endogenous Cys residues separated by 4 amino acids that are located within a region of the passenger protein termed domain-2A (D2A), which is roughly 50 amino acids in length and is present only in the serine protease ATs of the Enterobacteriaceae that elicit toxic effects on eukaryotic cells (supplemental Fig. S1). We systematically determine the maximum length of a disulfide-bonded loop that does not interfere with translocation, providing data that strongly support the hairpin mode of AT biogenesis. In addition, we demonstrate that when present, native Cys pairs within AT passenger domains are intrinsically closely spaced to avoid jamming of the translocator pore by large disulfide-bonded regions. A polyclonal rabbit antiserum generated toward the Pet passenger domain (37Eslava C. Navarro-García F. Czeczulin J.R. Henderson I.R. Cravioto A. Nataro J.P. Infect.

Anti-FLAG tag antibody raised in rabbits and Alexa Fluor® 488 goat anti-rabbit IgG (H+L) were purchased from GenScript and Invitrogen, respectively. Anti-HA tag antibody produced in rabbits, alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibodies, and the alkaline phosphatase substrate 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolylphosphate were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Bacteria were grown at 37 ºC in Luria-Bertani (LB) broth, and where necessary, the growth medium was supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin, 50 μg/ml kanamycin, 2% d-glucose, or 0.02% l-arabinose. The Escherichia coli strains used in this study were TOP10 (Invitrogen) and BW25113 dsbA::kan (38Baba T. Ara T. Hasegawa M. Takai Y. Okumura Y. Baba M. Datsenko K.A. Tomita M. Wanner B.L. Mori H.

A 363-bp SpeI-XbaI fragment comprising sequence coding for Pet without D2A was synthesized de novo and cloned into pUC57 (GenScript). pUC57ΔD2A was digested with SpeI and XbaI and subcloned into pBADPet, predigested with the same restriction enzymes, to create pBADPetΔD2A. To construct pUC57SB and pUC57L4HA, 624- and 771-bp fragments, respectively, were synthesized de novo and cloned into pUC57. pUC57SB and pUC57L4HA were digested separately with SalI and KpnI and with HpaI and EcoRI and subcloned into pBADPet, predigested with the same restriction enzymes, to create pBADPetSB and pBADPetL4HA, respectively. The Pet derivatives comprising one, two, and three HA epitope tags between the Cys pair in D2A were generated through de novo synthesis of 362-, 389-, and 416-bp SpeI-BsrGI fragments, respectively, that were then cloned into pUC57. pUC571HA, pUC572HA, and pUC573HA were digested with SpeI and BsrGI and subcloned into pBADPet, predigested with the same restriction enzymes, to create pBADPet1HA, pBADPet2HA, and pBADPet3HA, respectively. A 335-bp de novo synthesized fragment with Cys-12/Cys-17 mutated to Gly and His-1/Ser-50 mutated to Cys was cloned into pUC57 to create pUC5748aa. This vector was digested with SpeI and BsrGI and subcloned into pBADPet, predigested with the same restriction enzymes, to generate pBADPet48aa. The latter expresses a Pet derivative where the Cys residues are separated by 48 amino acids. To construct pBADPetC12G, pBADPet6aa, pBADPet8aa, pBADPet10aa pBADPet12aa, pBADPet14aa, pBADPet16aa, and pBADPet9G, megaprimer PCR was performed as described previously (40Sarkar G. Sommer S.S. BioTechniques. 1990; 8: 404-407PubMed Google Scholar) with some variation. Briefly, all round 1 PCRs were performed on 500 ng of template DNA (pBADPet) with 1 μg of the appropriate mutagenesis primer always in combination with 1 μg of primer BsrGIRv per 100 μl of reaction mixture. Round 1 PCRs were then purified to remove residual primers from the megaprimer synthesized in this first round of amplification. Round 2 PCRs were performed with 4 μg of megaprimer and 1 μg of primer SpeIFw on 500 ng of template DNA (pBADPet) per 100 μl of reaction mixture. Round 2 amplicons and target vector (pBADPet) were then digested with SpeI and BsrGI and ligated. Constructs pBADPetC12G/C17G, pBADPet18aa, and pBADPet20aa were generated exactly as described above with the exception that pBADPetC12G was used as template DNA. The megaprimer PCR method was also used to generate pBADPet1HA-FLAG through insertion of a FLAG epitope tag between residues Gly-837 and Phe-838. Round 1 PCR was performed as described above using pBADPet as template DNA and the appropriate mutagenesis primer with primer SalIRv. Round 2 PCR ensued using primer BsrGIFw, and the subsequent amplicon and target vector (pBADPet) were then digested with BsrGI and SalI and ligated. pBADPet1HA-FLAG was digested with BsrGI and SalI and subcloned into pBADPetSB predigested with the same restriction enzymes to create pBADPetSB-FLAG. Primers used in this study are listed in supplemental Table S2. The λ Red recombinase system (41Datsenko K.A. Wanner B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 6640-6645Crossref PubMed Scopus (11205) Google Scholar) was used to construct an in-frame dsbA knock-out mutant of E. coli TOP10. Growth, expression, and precipitation of Pet from TOP10 and TOP10 dsbA::kan transformed with pBADPet derivatives were performed as described previously (39Leyton D.L. de Luna M.G. Sevastsyanovich Y.R. Tveen Jensen K. Browning D.F. Scott-Tucker A. Henderson I.R. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2010; 311: 133-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Where necessary, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol (β-ME; Sigma-Aldrich) was added to the culture medium to reduce disulfide bonds formed in the periplasm (20Junker M. Besingi R.N. Clark P.L. Mol. Microbiol. 2009; 71: 1323-1332Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Supernatant proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and detected by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R250 (BDH Laboratory Supplies) or Western immunoblotting using anti-Pet passenger antibody. Fixation and permeabilization of TOP10 cells transformed with pBADPet derivatives were performed as described previously (42Den Blaauwen T. Aarsman M.E. Vischer N.O. Nanninga N. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 47: 539-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Preparation of cells for live cell imaging was performed as described previously (43Renn J.P. Clark P.L. Methods Enzymol. 2011; 492: 233-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar) with minor modifications; poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips loaded with either fixed or live cells were washed three times with PBS, and nonspecific binding sites were blocked for 1 h in PBS containing 1% BSA (Europa Bioproducts). Coverslips were incubated with anti-Pet passenger, anti-HA tag, or anti-FLAG tag antibody for 1 h, washed three times with PBS, and incubated for an additional 1 h with Alexa Fluor® 488 goat anti-rabbit IgG. The coverslips were then washed three times with PBS, mounted onto glass slides, and visualized using either phase contrast or fluorescence using a Zeiss AxioImager Z2 microscope (100× objective) and an AxioCam MRm camera. Exposure time was 40 ms. Thiol modification reactions were performed to determine the presence or absence of disulfide bond formation in Pet using the thiol-specific reagent, mPEG-maleimide-10,000 Da (mPEG-Mal) (Sigma-Aldrich). Briefly, Pet from TOP10 cells transformed with pBADPet derivatives was expressed, and clarified supernatants were concentrated 100-fold as described previously (39Leyton D.L. de Luna M.G. Sevastsyanovich Y.R. Tveen Jensen K. Browning D.F. Scott-Tucker A. Henderson I.R. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2010; 311: 133-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Supernatants were buffer-exchanged into thiol modification buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5), and protein concentrations were calculated using Bradford protein assay reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions (Bio-Rad). mPEG-Mal was suspended in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) as a 40 mm stock solution and used immediately. Briefly, 30 μg of protein, sometimes pretreated with 10 mm Tris(2-carboxyethyl) phosphine (Sigma-Aldrich) for 1 h at room temperature, was mixed with 10 mm mPEG-Mal in a final volume of 30 μl (topped up with thiol modification buffer where necessary) and incubated overnight at 4 ºC. TCEP-treated (reduced) and untreated (oxidized) samples were mixed with the same volume of non-reducing SDS-sample buffer (2×), resolved on 4–20% gradient Precise protein gels in Tris-HEPES-SDS buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and localized by Western immunoblotting using anti-Pet passenger antibody. TOP10 cells transformed with pBADPet and pBADPetΔD2A expressed Pet, and clarified supernatants were concentrated as described above. Pet and PetΔD2A were purified, and far-UV CD spectra were collected as described previously (21Renn J.P. Clark P.L. Biopolymers. 2008; 89: 420-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) except that Pet derivatives were purified using a HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 75 gel filtration column (GE Healthcare), and far-UV CD measurements were collected from 190 to 260 nm on a JASCO J-715 spectropolarimeter at room temperature with a 1-mm path length cell, 2-nm bandwidth, 1-nm increments, 2-s response, 100 nm/min scanning speed, and continuous scanning mode. Eight scans were averaged, and the spectrum was subtracted for buffer contribution. Chemical cross-linking, spheroplast formation, and lysis of E. coli cultures for co-immunoprecipitation of BamA and BamD were performed as described previously (44Diepold A. Amstutz M. Abel S. Sorg I. Jenal U. Cornelis G.R. EMBO J. 2010; 29: 1928-1940Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). A total of 4 μg of anti-Pet passenger domain antibody was added into the cleared lysate, and the mixture was shaken for 1 h. A total of 60 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads (Sigma-Aldrich) was added to the lysate-antibody mixture, which was shaken for an additional 1 h. Beads within this mixture were pelleted (3,000 × g, 1 min) and washed three times with 1 ml of Pierce IP lysis buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) followed by one wash with 1 ml of PBS. Boiling in 50 μl of sample buffer containing DTT served to elute the proteins and to reverse the cross-linking reaction. The eluted fractions were centrifuged as above to completely remove the beads and separated on NuPAGE® 4–12% gradient Bis-Tris gels in MES buffer (Invitrogen). Western immunoblotting was carried out using rabbit polyclonal antibodies against the Pet passenger domain, BamA and BamD. With the exception of several polymorphic ATs of Chlamydia (45Henderson I.R. Lam A.C. Trends Microbiol. 2001; 9: 573-578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), a feature of AT proteins is the general paucity of Cys residues within the secreted passenger proteins. Where multiple Cys residues are present, the distances between the Cys pairs generally range from a minimum of 3 residues to a maximum of only 17 residues (46Letley D.P. Rhead J.L. Bishop K. Atherton J.C. Microbiology. 2006; 152: 1319-1325Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) (supplemental Table S3). It has previously been suggested that paired Cys residues found within AT passenger proteins are required for the correct biogenesis of ATs (46Letley D.P. Rhead J.L. Bishop K. Atherton J.C. Microbiology. 2006; 152: 1319-1325Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 47Miyazaki H. Yanagida N. Horinouchi S. Beppu T. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 6566-6572Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The Pet AT possesses a pair of endogenous Cys residues separated by 4 amino acids that are located within D2A. To determine the location of D2A, a three-dimensional model of Pet was built using the crystal structure of the homologous Hbp AT protein (26Otto B.R. Sijbrandi R. Luirink J. Oudega B. Heddle J.G. Mizutani K. Park S.Y. Tame J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 17339-17345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). The model reveals that like Hbp, Pet possesses a serine protease domain (D1), which is N-proximal to the β-helix. In the case of Hbp, discursive loops extend from the central β-helix at different points to form D2 and D3 (25Johnson T.A. Qiu J. Plaut A.G. Holyoak T. J. Mol. Biol. 2009; 389: 559-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 26Otto B.R. Sijbrandi R. Luirink J. Oudega B. Heddle J.G. Mizutani K. Park S.Y. Tame J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 17339-17345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Both domains are lacking from Pet. However, Pet possesses D2A in place of D3, and the Pet amino acid sequence directly adjacent to D2A (QPDWET) is almost completely conserved with Hbp (supplemental Fig. S1); it has been shown that these residues provide a platform for the projection of a stable external loop capable of independent movement (48Nishimura K. Tajima N. Yoon Y.H. Park S.Y. Tame J.R. J. Mol. Med. 2010; 88: 451-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Thus, our model predicts that D2A contacts D1"
https://openalex.org/W2152807601,"Spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) modifies the weight (or strength) of synaptic connections between neurons and is considered to be crucial for generating network structure. It has been observed in physiology that, in addition to spike timing, the weight update also depends on the current value of the weight. The functional implications of this feature are still largely unclear. Additive STDP gives rise to strong competition among synapses, but due to the absence of weight dependence, it requires hard boundaries to secure the stability of weight dynamics. Multiplicative STDP with linear weight dependence for depression ensures stability, but it lacks sufficiently strong competition required to obtain a clear synaptic specialization. A solution to this stability-versus-function dilemma can be found with an intermediate parametrization between additive and multiplicative STDP. Here we propose a novel solution to the dilemma, named log-STDP, whose key feature is a sublinear weight dependence for depression. Due to its specific weight dependence, this new model can produce significantly broad weight distributions with no hard upper bound, similar to those recently observed in experiments. Log-STDP induces graded competition between synapses, such that synapses receiving stronger input correlations are pushed further in the tail of (very) large weights. Strong weights are functionally important to enhance the neuronal response to synchronous spike volleys. Depending on the input configuration, multiple groups of correlated synaptic inputs exhibit either winner-share-all or winner-take-all behavior. When the configuration of input correlations changes, individual synapses quickly and robustly readapt to represent the new configuration. We also demonstrate the advantages of log-STDP for generating a stable structure of strong weights in a recurrently connected network. These properties of log-STDP are compared with those of previous models. Through long-tail weight distributions, log-STDP achieves both stable dynamics for and robust competition of synapses, which are crucial for spike-based information processing."

We designed a multistage adenovirus 5 (Ad5)-vectored Plasmodium falciparum malaria vaccine, aiming to induce both types of responses in humans, that was tested for safety and immunogenicity in a Phase 1 dose escalation trial in Ad5-seronegative volunteers. Methodology/Principal Findings The NMRC-M3V-Ad-PfCA vaccine combines two adenovectors encoding circumsporozoite protein (CSP) and apical membrane antigen-1 (AMA1). Group 1 (n = 6) healthy volunteers received one intramuscular injection of 2×10∧10 particle units (1×10∧10 each construct) and Group 2 (n = 6) a five-fold higher dose. Transient, mild to moderate adverse events were more pronounced with the higher dose. ELISpot responses to CSP and AMA1 peaked at 1 month, were higher in the low dose (geomean CSP = 422, AMA1 = 862 spot forming cells/million) than in the high dose (CSP = 154, p = 0.049, AMA1 = 423, p = 0.045) group and were still positive at 12 months in a number of volunteers. ELISpot depletion assays identified dependence on CD4+ or on both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, with few responses dependent only on CD8+ T cells. Intracellular cytokine staining detected stronger CD8+ than CD4+ T cell IFN-γ responses (CSP p = 0.0001, AMA1 p = 0.003), but similar frequencies of multifunctional CD4+ and CD8+ T cells secreting two or more of IFN-γ, TNF-α or IL-2. Median fluorescence intensities were 7–10 fold higher in triple than single secreting cells. Antibody responses were low but trended higher in the high dose group and did not inhibit growth of cultured P. falciparum blood stage parasites. Significance As found in other trials, adenovectored vaccines appeared safe and well-tolerated at doses up to 1×10∧11 particle units. This is the first demonstration in humans of a malaria vaccine eliciting strong CD8+ T cell IFN-γ responses. Trial Registration ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00392015"

They found that synaptic transmission and AMPAR were reduced without changes in extrasynaptic AMPAR expression, but LTP was unaltered. The reduction in synaptic transmission and plasticity in mice lacking the hippocampus-enriched AMPA receptor (AMPAR) auxiliary subunit TARPγ-8 could be a result of a reduction in AMPAR expression or of the direct action of γ-8. We generated TARPγ-8Δ4 knock-in mice lacking the C-terminal PDZ ligand. We found that synaptic transmission and AMPARs were reduced in the mutant mice, but extrasynaptic AMPAR expression and long-term potentiation (LTP) were unaltered. Our findings suggest that there are distinct TARP-dependent mechanisms for synaptic transmission and LTP."
https://openalex.org/W2041446253,"Salmonella cycles between host and nonhost environments, where it can become an active member of complex microbial communities. The role of fungi in the environmental adaptation of enteric pathogens remains relatively unexplored. We have discovered that S. enterica Typhimurium rapidly attaches to and forms biofilms on the hyphae of the common fungus, Aspergillus niger. Several Salmonella enterica serovars displayed a similar interaction, whereas other bacterial species were unable to bind to the fungus. Bacterial attachment to chitin, a major constituent of fungal cell walls, mirrored this specificity. Pre-incubation of S. Typhimurium with N-acetylglucosamine, the monomeric component of chitin, reduced binding to chitin beads by as much as 727-fold and inhibited attachment to A. niger hyphae considerably. A cellulose-deficient mutant of S. Typhimurium failed to attach to chitin beads and to the fungus. Complementation of this mutant with the cellulose operon restored binding to chitin beads to 79% of that of the parental strain and allowed for attachment and biofilm formation on A. niger, indicating that cellulose is involved in bacterial attachment to the fungus via the chitin component of its cell wall. In contrast to cellulose, S. Typhimurium curli fimbriae were not required for attachment and biofilm development on the hyphae but were critical for its stability. Our results suggest that cellulose–chitin interactions are required for the production of mixed Salmonella-A. niger biofilms, and support the hypothesis that encounters with chitinaceous alternate hosts may contribute to the ecological success of human pathogens."
https://openalex.org/W2032338212,"The protein encoded by the sirt1 gene is an enzyme, SirT1, that couples the hydrolysis of NAD(+) to the deacetylation of acetyl-lysine residues in substrate proteins. Mutations of the sirt1 gene that fail to encode protein have been introduced into the mouse germ line, and the animals homozygous for these null mutations have various physiological abnormalities. To determine which of the characteristics of these sirt1(-/-) mice are a consequence of the absence of the catalytic activity of the SirT1 protein, we created a mouse strain carrying a point mutation (H355Y) that ablates the catalytic activity but does not affect the amount of the SirT1 protein. Mice carrying point mutations in both sirt1 genes, sirt1(Y/Y), have a phenotype that is overlapping but not identical to that of the sirt1-null animals. The sirt1(Y/Y) phenotype is significantly milder than that seen in the sirt1(-/-) animals. For example, female sirt1(Y/Y) animals are fertile, while sirt1(-/-) females are sterile. On the other hand, both sirt1(-/-) and sirt1(Y/Y) male mice are sterile and hypermetabolic. We report that sirt1(Y/Y) mice respond aberrantly to caloric restriction, although the effects are more subtle than seen in sirt1(-/-) mice. Thus, the SirT1 protein has functions that can be attributed to the catalytic activity of the protein, as well as other functions that are conferred by the protein itself."
https://openalex.org/W2109061188,"SIRT1 is a highly-conserved NAD+-de-pendent protein deacetylase that plays essential roles in the regulation of energy metabolism, genomic stability, and stress response. Although the functions of SIRT1 in many organs have been extensively studied in tissue-specific knockout mouse models, the systemic role of SIRT1 is still largely unknown as a result of severe developmental defects that result from whole-body knockout in mice. Here, we investigated the systemic functions of SIRT1 in metabolic homeostasis by utilizing a whole-body SIRT1 heterozygous mouse model. These mice are phenotypically normal under standard feeding conditions. However, when chronically challenged with a 40% fat diet, they become obese and insulin resistant, display increased serum cytokine levels, and develop hepatomegaly. Hepatic metabolomic analyses revealed that SIRT1 heterozygous mice have elevated gluconeogenesis and oxidative stress. Surprisingly, they are depleted of glycerolipid metabolites and free fatty acids, yet accumulate lysolipids. Moreover, high-fat feeding induces elevation of serum testosterone levels and enlargement of seminal vesicles in SIRT1 heterozygous males. Microarray analysis of liver mRNA indicates that they have altered expression of genes involved in steroid metabolism and glycerolipid metabolism. Taken together, our findings indicate that SIRT1 plays a vital role in the regulation of systemic energy and steroid hormone homeostasis.—Purushotham, A., Xu, Q., Li, X.

https://openalex.org/W2099140890,"Two bifunctional enzymes exhibiting combined xylanase and laccase activities were designed, constructed, and characterized by biochemical and biophysical methods. The Bacillus subtilis cotA and xynA genes were used as templates for gene fusion, and the xynA coding sequence was inserted into a surface loop of the cotA. A second chimera was built replacing the wild-type xynA gene by a thermostable variant (xynAG3) previously obtained by in vitro molecular evolution. Kinetic measurements demonstrated that the pH and temperature optima of the catalytic domains in the chimeras were altered by less than 0.5 pH units and 5 °C, respectively, when compared with the parental enzymes. In contrast, the catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) of the laccase activity in both chimeras was 2-fold higher than for the parental laccase. Molecular dynamics simulations of the CotA-XynA chimera indicated that the two domains are in close contact, which was confirmed by the low resolution structure obtained by small angle x-ray scattering. The simulation also indicates that the formation of the inter-domain interface causes the dislocation of the loop comprising residues Leu-558 to Lys-573 in the laccase domain, resulting in a more accessible active site and exposing the type I Cu2+ ion to the solvent. These structural changes are consistent with the results from UV-visible electronic and EPR spectroscopy experiments of the type I copper between the native and chimeric enzymes and are likely to contribute to the observed increase in catalytic turnover number.

Kinetic measurements demonstrated that the pH and temperature optima of the catalytic domains in the chimeras were altered by less than 0.5 pH units and 5 °C, respectively, when compared with the parental enzymes. In contrast, the catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) of the laccase activity in both chimeras was 2-fold higher than for the parental laccase. Molecular dynamics simulations of the CotA-XynA chimera indicated that the two domains are in close contact, which was confirmed by the low resolution structure obtained by small angle x-ray scattering. The simulation also indicates that the formation of the inter-domain interface causes the dislocation of the loop comprising residues Leu-558 to Lys-573 in the laccase domain, resulting in a more accessible active site and exposing the type I Cu2+ ion to the solvent. These structural changes are consistent with the results from UV-visible electronic and EPR spectroscopy experiments of the type I copper between the native and chimeric enzymes and are likely to contribute to the observed increase in catalytic turnover number. The plant cell wall is a complex structure in which mixed linked glycans and lignin are closely associated in a compound structure that forms a protective sheath around the cellulose fibers (1Grabber J.H. Crop Sci. 2005; 45: 820-831Crossref Scopus (411) Google Scholar, 2McCann M.C. Carpita N.C. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2008; 11: 314-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The degradation of this complex structure requires an enzymatic mixture that includes ligninases and hemicellulases, and consequently laccases and xylanases have attracted considerable interest and have been extensively studied. Laccases (benzenediol:oxygen oxidoreductase; EC 1.10.3.2) are important components of the lignolytic complex responsible for lignin decomposition (3Wong D.W. Appl. Biochem. Biotechnol. 2009; 157: 174-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar) and are widely distributed among fungi, higher plants, and bacteria (4Claus H. Micron. 2004; 35: 93-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). The CotA laccase is a multicopper oxidase present in the endospore coat of Bacillus subtilis (5Hullo M.F. Moszer I. Danchin A. Martin-Verstraete I. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 5426-5430Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar) and is composed of three greek key β-barrel cupredoxin domains and harbors a total of four copper atoms, which are classified on the basis of their spectroscopic properties as follows: one type 1 (T1) copper, one type 2 (T2), and two type 3 (T3) copper ions (6Stoj C.S. Kosman D.J. King B. Encyclopedia of Inorganic Chemistry. Vol. II. John Wiley, New York2005: 1134-1159Google Scholar). The T1 copper ion gives the protein a blue color that is typical of multicopper proteins and is a mononuclear catalytic center involved in substrate oxidation. The T2 and T3 copper ions form a trinuclear center, responsible for O2 reduction and the release of H2O (7Solomon E.I. Sundaram U.M. Machonkin T.E. Chem.

Dalton Trans. 2005; 21: 3507-3513Crossref Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Laccases are exceptionally versatile enzymes, catalyzing reactions with different and frequently recalcitrant substrates, which lends these enzymes considerable biotechnological potential (9Gianfreda L. Xu F. JM B. Bioremediation J. 1999; 3: 1-26Crossref Scopus (655) Google Scholar, 10Rodríguez Couto S. Toca Herrera J.L. Biotechnol. Adv. 2006; 24: 500-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (1052) Google Scholar). Xylan is the second most abundant polysaccharide found in nature, representing a large proportion of the hemicelluloses present in wood and graminaceous plant tissues (11Saha B.C. J. Ind. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2003; 30: 279-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (1540) Google Scholar). Xylanases (endo-1,4-β-xylanase, EC 3.2.1.8) are important enzymes for hemicellulose degradation, hydrolyzing the β-1,4-glycosidic bonds between xylose residues in xylan (12Shallom D. Shoham Y. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2003; 6: 219-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar); family 11 xylanases display a jelly roll fold including a single α-helix and two twisted β-sheets (13Collins T. Gerday C. Feller G. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2005; 29: 3-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (1300) Google Scholar, 14Paës G. Tran V. Takahashi M. Boukari I. O'Donohue M.J. Protein Eng. Des. Sel. 2007; 20: 15-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In common with all GH11 xylanases, the structure of B. subtilis xylanase A (XynA) resembles a right hand, where the β-strands form the finger and palm domains that constitute the active site cleft, access to which is regulated by movements of a flexible β-turn structure denominated as the “thumb” domain (15Murakami M.T.

EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2493-2501Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Various applications of laccases, xylanases, and laccase/xylanase combinations have been reported for improved processing of lignocellulosic feed stocks. These include the reduction in the levels of chlorine-based oxidants in the paper and pulp bleaching process with the consequent reduction in pollutants (17Bajpai P. Crit. Rev. Biotechnol. 2004; 24: 1-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 18Valls C. Roncero M.B. Bioresource Technol. 2009; 100: 2032-2039Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) and the use of these enzymes to improve the biochemical and rheological properties of wheat flour, gluten, rye, oats, and other cereals for the baking industry (19Flander L. Rouau X. Morel M.H. Autio K. Seppänen-Laakso T. Kruus K. Buchert J. J. Agric. Food Chem. 2008; 56: 5732-5742Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 20Andersson R. Eliasson C. Selenare M. Kamal-Eldin A. Aman P. J. Sci. Food Agric. 2003; 83: 617-623Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Synergism between laccase and xylanase may also benefit the animal feed sector by increasing the digestibility of enzyme-treated lignocellulosic material in the animal diet (21Pandey A. Soccol C.R. J. Sci. Ind. Res. 2000; 59: 12-22Google Scholar). Furthermore, these enzymes can be used to generate biofuels from biomass during the delignification process that is necessary to produce second generation ethanol from lignocellulose feed stocks (22Yuan J.S. Tiller K.H. Al-Ahmad H. Stewart N.R. Stewart Jr., C.N. Trends Plant Sci. 2008; 13: 421-429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar, 23Alper H. Stephanopoulos G. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2009; 7: 715-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). During evolution, genes that encode proteins with related functions have frequently undergone fusion events, generating multifunctional enzymes (24Doi R.H. Kosugi A. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2004; 2: 541-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar, 25Blum D.L. Kataeva I.A. Li X.L. Ljungdahl L.G. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 1346-1351Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Biochemists and bioengineers share a common goal of understanding protein evolution, and protein engineering methods have been used to mimic processes observed in nature (26Bloom J.D. Arnold F.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 9995-10000Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Engineering multidomains enzymes that are capable of catalyzing two or more reactions is a potential strategy to reduce enzyme costs in industrial processes, as including multiple catalytic properties in a single polypeptide simplifies production and purification operations for the recombinant product. Moreover, when enzymes are fused to form chimera, the physical proximity between the resulting catalytic domains may increase the rate of the reactions, and chimeric enzymes frequently have an improved performance as compared with the activities of the separate parental enzymes (27Gilbert M. Bayer R. Cunningham A.M. DeFrees S. Gao Y. Watson D.C. Young N.M. Wakarchuk W.W. Nat. Biotechnol. 1998; 16: 769-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Hybrid enzymes are created by recruiting functions of existing enzymes and fusing them by structure-based design (28Aÿ J. Götz F. Borriss R. Heinemann U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 6613-6618Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar); therefore, these enzymes (or their fragments) can potentially serve as building blocks for the creation of polypeptides with combinations of catalytic activities not found in nature (29Nixon A.E. Ostermeier M. Benkovic S.J. Trends Biotechnol. 1998; 16: 258-264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Chimeric proteins have been constructed for various purposes, including improved stability (30Hua Y.W. Chi M.C. Lo H.F. Hsu W.H. Lin L.L. J. Ind. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2004; 31: 273-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 31Mandai T. Fujiwara S. Imaoka S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2009; 384: 61-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), the creation of new substrate specificities (32Thulasiram H.V. Erickson H.K. Poulter C.D. Science. 2007; 316: 73-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 33Zhang P. Bao Y. Higgins L. Xu S.Y. Protein Eng. Des. Sel. 2007; 20: 497-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), and increasing substrate affinity for enhanced biosensor sensitivity (34Guan Z. Yao W. Ye J. Dan W. Shen J. Zhang S. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2007; 73: 1114-1122Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 35Dan W.B. Zhang C. Guan Z.B. Zhang S.Q. Biotechnol. Lett. 2008; 30: 221-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). The creation of bifunctional enzymes acting on lignocellulosic materials has been shown to be a practical option for the improvement of enzymes involved in various processes, including biomass degradation (36Fan Z. Wagschal K. Chen W. Montross M.D. Lee C.C. Yuan L. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2009; 75: 1754-1757Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). A key aspect in the construction of enzyme chimeras is the preservation or improvement of the catalytic characteristics of the parental proteins. A widely used approach involves the “end-to-end” fusion between the N and C termini of the parental enzymes; however, this technique may result in nonfunctional chimeras either due to misfolding or to restrictions resulting from steric hindrance between the domains (37Hong S.Y. Lee J.S. Cho K.M. Math R.K. Kim Y.H. Hong S.J. Cho Y.U. Cho S.J. Kim H. Yun H.D. Biotechnol. Lett. 2007; 29: 931-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In some cases, these restrictions may be overcome by the insertion of a loop at the fusion site to increase inter-domain flexibility and maintain functionality of the parental enzymes (38Crasto C.J. Feng J.A. Protein Eng. 2000; 13: 309-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 39Fan Z. Wagschal K. Lee C.C. Kong Q. Shen K.A. Maiti I.B. Yuan L. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2009; 102: 684-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). A key factor for success in the creation of enzyme chimeras is the compatibility between the two catalytic activities with respect to their physicochemical requirements such as pH and temperature optima. Here we present the design, construction, and characterization of two novel multifunctional enzymes that combine laccase and xylanase activities. With the aim of improving the catalytic overlap of the two activities in the chimeras, swapping of the xylanase domain was used to introduce a thermophilic variant, which improved the compatibility between the catalytic functions. We reasoned that the surface loops in the B. subtilis laccase (CotA) were the most favored sites for insertion of the endo-β-1,4-xylanase (XynA) to obtain a chimera with minimum disruption of the native conformation of the parental enzymes. A survey of the three-dimensional structure of the crystal structure of the CotA (PDB code 1GSK) restricted the insertion sites on the basis of possible steric hindrance between the two protein molecules or unfavorable orientation of the active sites after fusion of the two polypeptides. In addition, the location of the insertion was further restricted by considering loops with elevated crystallographic B-factors with the aim of maintaining flexibility in the inter-domain linking regions. On the basis of this analysis, the XynA was inserted between residues Ser-216 and Pro-217 in the laccase using the high resolution structures of xylanase (PDB code 1XXN (15Murakami M.T. Arni R.K. Vieira D.S. Degrève L. Ruller R. Ward R.J. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 6505-6510Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar)) and laccase from B. subtilis (PDB code 1GSK (40Enguita F.J. Martins L.O. Henriques A.O. Carrondo M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19416-19425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar)) as templates for building a structural model of the CotA-XynA chimera by comparative modeling techniques with the program Modeler (24Doi R.H. Kosugi A. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2004; 2: 541-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). The structural model was validated utilizing the program Procheck (41Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Thornton J.M. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 631-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), which showed that 91% of residues were in highly favored regions of the Ramachandran graph. Molecular dynamics simulations (MDS) were performed using the GROMACS simulation package version 4.5.3 (42Hess B. Kutzner C. van der Spoel D. Lindahl E. Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation. 2008; 4: 435-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (12353) Google Scholar) with the GROMOS96 (43A2) force field (43van Gunsteren W.F. Billeter S.R. Eising A.A.

Biomolecular Simulation: The gromos96 Manual and User Guide. vdf Hochschulverlag AG an der ETH Zürich, Zürich, Switzerland1996Google Scholar). The crystal structure of the B. subtilis CotA laccase (PDB entry 1GSK) and the CotA-XylA chimera (constructed as described above) were used as the starting structures. The simulation boxes for the laccase (x = 10.0 nm; y = 8.6 nm; z = 9.2 nm) and the chimera (x = 13.80 nm; y = 10.0 nm, z = 9.8 nm) included five and four Na+ ions, respectively, to maintain electrical neutrality. The “leapfrog” algorithm (44Van Gunsteren W.F. Berendsen H.J. Mol. Simulat. 1988; 1: 173-185Crossref Scopus (855) Google Scholar) was used to integrate the equations of motion with a time step of 2.0 fs over a total time of 40.0 ns. In all simulations, periodic boundary conditions and a minimum image convention were applied, and the atom neighbor list (45Allen M.P. Tildesley D.J. Computer Simulation of Liquids. Clarendon Press, Oxford Science Publications, Oxford, U.K1987Google Scholar) within 1.4 nm was updated every 10 steps. The Particle-Mesh Ewald technique (46Darden T. York D. Pedersen L. J. Chem. Phys. 1993; 98: 10089-10092Crossref Scopus (20832) Google Scholar) was used for the treatment of electrostatic interactions, with a Particle-Mesh Ewald order of 4 and a Fourier spacing of 0.12. The system was maintained at a constant temperature of 300 K using the V-rescale thermostat with a coupling time (42Hess B. Kutzner C. van der Spoel D. Lindahl E. Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation. 2008; 4: 435-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (12353) Google Scholar) of 0.2 ps. Both simulations were performed with the number-volume-temperature (NVT) ensemble (47Ciccotti G. Frenkel D. McDonald I.R. Simulation of Liquids and Solids. North-Holland Press, Amsterdam, The Netherlands1987Google Scholar). Bond lengths involving hydrogen atoms were constrained by means of the LINCS algorithm (48Hess B. Bekker H. Berendsen H.J. Fraaije J.G. J. Comput. Chem. 1997; 18: 1463-1472Crossref Scopus (11575) Google Scholar), and the SETTLE algorithm (49Miyamoto S. Kollman P.A. J. Comput. Chem. 1992; 13: 952-962Crossref Scopus (5201) Google Scholar) was used to constrain water molecules. The imidazole groups of histidines (and their equivalents in the chimera) form contacts with the four Cu2+ ions and were protonated (using either HISA or HISB in the GROMOS force field). To maintain the nitrogen to Cu2+ contacts and histidine positions as observed in the laccase crystal structure, the positions of the four Cu2+ ions together with the nitrogen, sulfur, and carbon atoms in side chains in immediate contact (His-106, -152, -154, -604, -607, -609, -676, and -682; Cys-677 and Ile-679) were maintained in their original positions during the simulation. The root mean square deviation (r.m.s.d.) 2The abbreviations used are: r.m.s.d.root mean square deviationABTS2,2′-azino-bis-(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid)SAXSsmall angle x-ray scatteringPDBProtein Data BankMDSmolecular dynamics simulations. was calculated using the g_rms program within the GROMACS 4.5.3 package. The interaction potential was obtained from the simulation trajectory using the program mdrun (with the “rerun” option) considering only short range potentials at a distance of <1.0 nm. root mean square deviation 2,2′-azino-bis-(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) small angle x-ray scattering Protein Data Bank molecular dynamics simulations. Escherichia coli strain DH5α was used for cloning and propagation of all plasmid constructs. pT7T3 18U (Amersham Biosciences) were used as cloning vectors. For protein expression, E. coli BL21(DE3) pLysS and RosettaTM (DE3) (Invitrogen) was host of the inducible T7 expression vector pET28a (+) recombinants. Genomic DNA of the PAP1158 strain of Bacillus subtilis (BGSC 1A1 code 168) was used as the template for PCR amplification of the xynA gene encoding endo-β-1,4-xylanase as described previously (50Ruller R. Rosa J.C. Faça V.M. Greene L.J. Ward R.J. Biotechnol. Appl. Biochem. 2006; 43: 9-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The laccase gene, cotA (GenBankTM accession number 936023 (51Durão P. Bento I. Fernandes A.T. Melo E.P. Lindley P.F. Martins L.O. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 2006; 11: 514-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar)), was amplified from genomic DNA by PCR using primers P1 (5′-aaggaaagcttgctagcACACTTGAAAAATTTGTGGATGCTCT-3′) that included the 5′-end of the cotA (uppercase) and restriction sites (underlined) for HindIII (boldface) and NheI (italic), and P6 (5′-GTAATACGATAAATAGGATCCAAAGGTTTCATAAAG-3′), encoding the 3′-end of the cotA and including a BamHI site (underlined). The 1624-bp PCR product was digested with HindIII and BamHI, cloned into plasmid pT7T3–18U (Amersham Biosciences) to yield pTcotA, and after full nucleotide sequencing was subsequently subcloned into pET28a(+) (Novagen) using the NheI and BamHI restriction sites to generate pETCotA. Cloning of the endo-1,4-β-xylanase from B. subtilis (xynA) and creation of a thermophilic variant of the same enzyme (XynAG3) by directed evolution have been previously described (50Ruller R. Rosa J.C. Faça V.M. Greene L.J. Ward R.J. Biotechnol. Appl. Biochem. 2006; 43: 9-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 52Ruller R. Deliberto L. Ferreira T.L. Ward R.J. Proteins. 2008; 70: 1280-1293Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Both the native XynA and XynAG3 coding sequences were subcloned into the NheI and BamHI sites of pET28a(+) to create pETXynA and pETXynAG3, respectively. The scheme for the construction of the chimeric enzymes is presented in Fig. 1. The cotA gene was divided into two fragments as follows: a 661-nucleotide fragment encoding the N-terminal 216 amino acids up to Ser-216 (fragment A), and the rest of gene encoding Pro-217 to the C-terminal residue (fragment B). Fragment A was amplified by PCR using the pTcotA as a template with primers P1 and P2 (5′-ggtcactgCAGAAGGGTTTTCCGGTGCGCT-3′, PstI site underlined), which introduced a PstI restriction site at the 3′ extremity of the amplified fragment. Fragment B was amplified with P5 (5′-agtggggCCCTCACTGCCTAATCCTTCAAT-3′) and P6 primers, where P5 introduced an ApaI site (underlined). Fragment A was digested with HindIII and PstI and fragment B with ApaI and BamHI. The parental XynA and XynAG3 xylanase variants were amplified by PCR with P3 (5′-agctcctgcaGCCAGTACAGACTACTGGCAAA-3′) and P4 (5′-cccacgggCCCCCACACTGTTACGTTAGAA-3′) primers, using the cloned genes in pT7T3–18U as a template, which introduced restriction sites (underlined) for PstI and ApaI, respectively. The amplified xylanase fragment was digested with PstI and ApaI and mixed with digested fragments A and B, and the mixture ligated into HindIII- and BamHI- digested pT7T3–18U creating the full-length pTcot-xyn. The final construct was sequenced, and the HindIII-BamHI fragment was subcloned into pET28a(+). Both the XynA and XynAG3 were expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) pLysS transformed with pETXynA or pETXynAG3 grown in HDM medium containing (per liter) 25 g of yeast extract, 15 g of tryptone, 1.2 g of MgSO4, supplemented with 40 μg·ml−1 kanamycin and 34 μg·ml−1 chloramphenicol. The cells were grown at 37 °C to A600 of 0.6, and expression was induced with 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 5 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation (8000 × g, 4 °C, 5 min), and the cell pellets were retained for further processing. The parental CotA and CotA-XynA and CotA-XynAG3 chimeras were expressed as described previously (53Durão P. Chen Z. Fernandes A.T. Hildebrandt P. Murgida D.H. Todorovic S. Pereira M.M. Melo E.P. Martins L.O. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 2008; 13: 183-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), using E. coli Rosetta (DE3) grown in HDM with kanamycin (40 μg·ml−1) and chloramphenicol (34 μg·ml−1). After 24 h of induction, the cells were harvested by centrifugation (8000 × g, 4 °C, 5 min). For all the recombinant enzymes, whole-cell extracts were prepared from cell pellets by ultrasonication in 4% of the original culture volume of lysis buffer (100 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1% Triton X-100, and 10 mm imidazole). The cell extracts were cooled on ice and cleared of cell debris by centrifugation (10,000 × g, 4 °C, 30 min). The supernatants were loaded on an immobilized metal affinity column (GE Healthcare) pre-equilibrated with a buffer containing 100 mm HEPES, 50 mm NaCl, and 10 mm imidazole (pH 7.5). The column was washed with buffer containing 100 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 300 mm NaCl, and 40 mm imidazole for xylanases, 50 mm for laccase, and 60 mm for the chimeras, until no further reduction in the A280 was observed. Protein was eluted with 300 mm imidazole, and protein samples were dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 200 mm NaCl and stored at 4 °C for future use. Laccase and chimeras were concentrated with a 50-kDa cutoff membrane (Centricon, Millipore, São Paulo, Brazil), and protein concentrations were determined by measuring the A280. Laccase activity was determined by the rate of oxidation of 2,2′-azinobis-(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS), which was monitored at 420 nm (ϵ = 36 000 m−1 cm−1) (54Arnold F.H. Georgiou G. Methods Mol. Biol. 2003; 230: 193-201PubMed Google Scholar). The effect of pH on the enzyme activity was determined at 37 °C in 100 mm containing pH-appropriate buffers as follows: glycine-HCl (pH 3.0), sodium acetate (pH 4.0–5.0), MES-HCl (pH 5.5–6.5), MOPS-NaOH (pH 7.0–7.5), Tris-HCl (pH 8.0–8.5), arginine-NaOH (pH 9.0), glycine-NaOH (pH 9.5), CAPS-NaOH (pH 10–11), and arginine-NaOH (pH 12). In all assays, 10 μl (20 nm) of purified enzyme was mixed with 190 μl of ABTS solution (1 mm ABTS, 5% PEG 5000, 50 mm buffer at the desired pH) in 96-well plates and heated for 2 min followed by rapid cooling to 4 °C for 1 min, and sample absorbance was measured at 420 nm. The effect of the temperature on laccase activity was measured in 100 mm sodium acetate buffer (pH 4.5) over the range 60–85 °C, using a Peltier heating system coupled to a Cary 50 UV-visible spectrophotometer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). The thermotolerance of the enzyme was measured by incubating 25 μg of purified enzyme at 80 °C, and at appropriate times samples were withdrawn, cooled, and residual activity was measured using the ABTS oxidation assay at 37 °C. The effect of pH on xylan hydrolysis by the purified XynA and XynAG3 was measured using the same buffers as for the laccase assays, with 1% (w/v) oat spelt xylan substrate (Sigma) as described previously (50Ruller R. Rosa J.C. Faça V.M. Greene L.J. Ward R.J. Biotechnol. Appl. Biochem. 2006; 43: 9-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The effect of temperature on xylanase activity was conducted at temperatures between 20 and 85 °C in 100 mm MES-HCl, pH 6.5, for the native xylanase and the CotA-XynA fusion and in 100 mm MOPS-NaOH, pH 7.0 for the XynAG3 xylanase and CotA-XynAG3 fusion. Thermostability was determined by incubation of ∼60 μg of the purified enzymes at 70 °C, and residual activity was measured in aliquots collected at different times. Kinetic parameters for the purified laccase and laccase/xylanase chimeras were determined at 37 °C in 100 mm sodium acetate buffer (pH 4.5) using increasing concentrations of ABTS (5–200 μm) in 1-cm cuvettes. Reactions were initiated by addition of 20 nm of the purified proteins, and the rates of oxidation obtained from the linear portion of the reaction curve by the slopes (ΔA/Δt) were measured from 96 to 150 s. The xylanase kinetic parameters were determined using the oat spelt xylan substrate in concentrations ranging from 1 to 12 mg/ml. Reactions were performed at the temperature and pH optima and initiated by addition of 30 nm of the purified enzymes. All enzymatic activities were determined in triplicate, and the maximum velocity (Vmax), apparent dissociation constant (Km), and catalytic constant (kcat) were calculated by nonlinear regression fitting of the data to the semi-logarithmic form of the Hill equation using the software SigrafW (55Leone F.A.

Data are reported as the mean of duplicate determinations, which differed by less than 5%, as verified by the Tukey test. Dried cellulose pulp (20 g) obtained from Eucalyptus grandis was prepared at 10% consistency in 100 mm NaCl and 50 mm MES (pH 6). A total of 5 nmol of enzyme (or enzyme mixture)/g of dried pulp and 1 mm ABTS were added, and the samples were incubated in sealed polyethylene bags at 60 °C for 24 h. Subsequently, the treated pulp was filtered through a Büchner funnel, and the absorbance of the filtrate was measured at 237 nm to determine phenolic chromophore release (56Patel R.N. Grabski A.C. Jeffries T.W. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 1993; 39: 405-412Crossref Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The pulp was washed with water and submitted to alkaline extraction using 1.5% NaOH at 60 °C for 1 h, followed by washing with 1 liter of distilled water. The κ number of the washed pulp was determined, which was defined as the volume of a 0.1 n KMnO4 solution consumed by 1.0 g of dried pulp under standard conditions. Control experiments were performed in which pulps were treated under the same conditions but in the absence of enzyme. All the procedures and calculations were carried out according to TAPPI (Atlanta, GA) methodology (57TAPPI Technical Association of the Pulp and Paper Industry TAPPI Test Methods.

UV-visible absorption spectra of laccase and laccase/xylanase fusions were measured at 25 °C between 300 and 800 nm in 1.0-cm quartz cuvettes using a Cary 50 UV-visible spectrophotometer. Measurements were performed using ∼2 mg/ml of protein in 10 mm HEPES buffer (pH 7.5) and 100 mm NaCl. Low temperature (10 K) EPR experiments were carried out in a Bruker EL"
https://openalex.org/W1986346641,"Genetic ablation of Iron Regulatory Protein 2 (Irp2, Ireb2), which post-transcriptionally regulates iron metabolism genes, causes a gait disorder in mice that progresses to hind-limb paralysis. Here we have demonstrated that misregulation of iron metabolism from loss of Irp2 causes lower motor neuronal degeneration with significant spinal cord axonopathy. Mitochondria in the lumbar spinal cord showed significantly decreased Complex I and II activities, and abnormal morphology. Lower motor neurons appeared to be the most adversely affected neurons, and we show that functional iron starvation due to misregulation of iron import and storage proteins, including transferrin receptor 1 and ferritin, may have a causal role in disease. We demonstrated that two therapeutic approaches were beneficial for motor neuron survival. First, we activated a homologous protein, IRP1, by oral Tempol treatment and found that axons were partially spared from degeneration. Secondly, we genetically decreased expression of the iron storage protein, ferritin, to diminish functional iron starvation. These data suggest that functional iron deficiency may constitute a previously unrecognized molecular basis for degeneration of motor neurons in mice."
https://openalex.org/W2074459286,"Sprouty (Spry) proteins modulate the actions of receptor tyrosine kinases during development and tumorigenesis. Decreases in cellular levels of Spry, especially Sprouty2 (Spry2), have been implicated in the growth and progression of tumors of the breast, prostate, lung, and liver. During development and tumor growth, cells experience hypoxia. Therefore, we investigated how hypoxia modulates the levels of Spry proteins. Hypoxia elevated the levels of all four expressed Spry isoforms in HeLa cells. Amounts of endogenous Spry2 in LS147T and HEP3B cells were also elevated by hypoxia. Using Spry2 as a prototype, we demonstrate that silencing and expression of prolyl hydroxylase domain proteins (PHD1–3) increase and decrease, respectively, the cellular content of Spry2. Spry2 also preferentially interacted with PHD1–3 and von Hippel-Lindau protein (pVHL) during normoxia but not in hypoxia. Additionally, Spry2 is hydroxylated on Pro residues 18, 144, and 160, and substitution of these residues with Ala enhanced stability of Spry2 and abrogated its interactions with pVHL. Silencing of pVHL increased levels of Spry2 by decreasing its ubiquitylation and degradation and thereby augmented the ability of Spry2 to inhibit FGF-elicited activation of ERK1/2. Thus, prolyl hydroxylase mediated hydroxylation and subsequent pVHL-elicited ubiquitylation of Spry2 target it for degradation and, consequently, provide a novel mechanism of regulating growth factor signaling.

Moreover, a direct correlation has been observed between decreased levels of Spry2 in hepatocellular carcinomas from patients and poor prognosis, including tumor metastasis (22Lee S.A. Ladu S.

Given the importance of Spry proteins in development as well as regulating pathological conditions such as tumorigenesis and cardiac hypertrophy, it is important to understand the mechanisms that regulate their levels. In this context, growth factors have been shown to increase the transcription of Spry proteins (3Minowada G. Jarvis L.A. Chi C.L. Neubüser A. Sun X. Hacohen N. Krasnow M.A. Martin G.R. Development. 1999; 126: 4465-4475Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Epigenetic regulation of the Spry2 promoter has also been shown to alter its transcription (14McKie A.B. Douglas D.A. Olijslagers S.

The levels of Spry proteins can also be regulated by post-translational mechanisms. Previous reports have shown that growth factor-mediated phosphorylation of Spry2 on Tyr-55 creates a binding site for the Src homology 2-like phosphotyrosine binding domain of the E3 ubiquitin ligase c-Cbl (c-Cbl is Casitas B-lineage lymphoma proto-oncogene) which can then ubiquitylate Spry2 and target it for proteosomal degradation (32Wong E.S.

Cell. 2004; 15: 2176-2188Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Similarly, the E3 ubiquitin ligase Siah2 can also polyubiquitylate Spry2 and target it for degradation (35Nadeau R.J. Toher J.L. Yang X. Kovalenko D. Friesel R. J. Cell. Biochem. 2007; 100: 151-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 36Qi J. Nakayama K. Gaitonde S. Goydos J.S. Krajewski S. Eroshkin A. Bar-Sagi D. Bowtell D. Ronai Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 16713-16718Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Recently, we demonstrated that a HECT domain containing E3 ubiquitin ligase, Nedd4-1, associates with Ser-phosphorylated Spry2 and targets it for degradation (37Edwin F. Anderson K. Patel T.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 255-264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In tumor samples derived from patients with hepatocellular carcinomas, the decrease in content of Spry2 best correlated with an increase in Nedd4-1 expression but not c-Cbl or Siah2 (22Lee S.A. Ladu S. Evert M. Dombrowski F. De Murtas V. Chen X. Calvisi D.F. Hepatology. 2010; 52: 506-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). However, not all of the patient-derived hepatocellular carcinomas had elevated Nedd4-1 levels (22Lee S.A. Ladu S. Evert M. Dombrowski F. De Murtas V. Chen X. Calvisi D.F. Hepatology. 2010; 52: 506-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Likewise, methylation of the Spry2 promoter or loss of heterozygosity did not account for decreased content of Spry2 in all hepatocellular carcinomas (22Lee S.A. Ladu S. Evert M. Dombrowski F. De Murtas V. Chen X. Calvisi D.F. Hepatology. 2010; 52: 506-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that other mechanisms are also involved in modulating levels of Spry2. Because rapidly growing cells in developing organs and tumors experience hypoxia, we postulated that the cellular content of Spry proteins may be regulated by hypoxia. Our studies demonstrated that the levels of all expressed Spry isoforms were elevated in hypoxia. Using Spry2 as a prototype, we show that prolyl hydroxylase domain proteins (PHDs) and von Hippel-Lindau protein (pVHL), a recognition component of elongins B/C and cullin E3 ubiquitin ligase (38Xie L.

The PHD/pVHL-mediated regulation of Spry2 also alters its ability to inhibit FGF signaling. This is the first demonstration of a novel post-translational mechanism that regulates cellular content of Spry2 via PHDs and pVHL and thereby alters its ability to modulate growth factor receptor actions. Dimethyloxallyl glycine (DMOG) was purchased from Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI), and recombinant human fibroblast growth factor basic (FGF) was purchased from CHEMICON (Temecula, CA). Deferoxamine (DFO), cycloheximide, N-ethylmaleimide, and MG132 were obtained from Sigma. All primers were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies Inc. Antibodies used for Western analyses of the various proteins were from the following sources: PHD1 (Novus Biological or Oxycell), PHD3 (Novus Biological or Oxycell), PHD2 (AbCam), HIF1α (BD Transduction Laboratories), ERK1/2 (Millipore), phospho-p44/p42 ERK1/2 (T202/Y204, Cell Signaling), actin (MP Biomedicals, LLC, Ohio), β-PIX (Cell Signaling), HA tag (HA-HRP from Roche Applied Science), FLAG tag (FLAG-HRP from Sigma), c-Myc (Covance, monoclonal), and pVHL (Cell Signaling, polyclonal).

The pCMV-3×-FLAG-PHD1 and pCMV-3×-FLAG-PHD3 plasmids were constructed from human cDNAs for EGLN2 (PHD1, MHS1010-7296053) and EGLN3 (PHD3, MHS1010–99621891) genes, respectively. The full-length gene sequence was PCR-amplified using forward (F) and reverse (R) primers that contained HindIII (boldface) and XbaI (underlined) restriction sites, respectively. The primer sequences were as follows: PHD1(F), 5′-GATACAAGCTTATGGACAGCCCGTGCCAGCCG-3′; PHD-3(F), 5′-GATACAAGCTTATGCCCCTGGGACACATCATGAGGCT-3′; PHD1(R), 5′-TGTTATCTAGACTAGGTGGGCGTAGGCGGCTGTGATAC-3′; and PHD3(R), TGTTTTCTAGATCAGTCTTCAGTGAGGGCAGATTCA-3′. Each PCR product was digested with HindIII/XbaI, purified, and ligated into the HindIII/XbaI site of pCMV-3×-FLAG expression vector (Sigma) to yield the pCMV-3×-FLAG-PHD1 or pCMV-3X-FLAG-PHD3 vectors. A pCS2+MT-6×-Myc-VHL construct was prepared from human cDNA for VHL genes (IHS1380-97652010). The full-length gene sequence was PCR-amplified using forward (F) and reverse (R) primers that contained EcoRI (boldface) and ApaI (underlined) restriction sites, respectively.

The PCR product was digested with EcoRI/ApaI, purified, and ligated into the EcoRI/ApaI site of pCS2+MT to yield the pCS2+MT-6×-Myc-VHL vector. pFLAG-PHD2 was a gift from Dr. Frank S. Lee, University of Pennsylvania, School of Medicine. pCMV-3×-FLAG-ubiquitin was kindly provided by Dr. Adriano Marchese, Loyola University Chicago. All other cDNAs were purchased from Open Biosystems (Huntsville, AL). All plasmid constructs were verified by sequencing. HEK293T and HeLa cells were cultured in high glucose DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). Cells were maintained under normoxic conditions at ambient O2 levels (21% O2) in a water-jacketed CO2 incubator (Thermo Forma) at 37 °C, 5% CO2. Cells grown under hypoxic conditions were maintained at 3% O2 in a Coy Hypoxic Chamber (Grass Lake, Michigan) at 37 °C, 5% CO2. All media used for hypoxia experiments was pre-equilibrated under hypoxic conditions for 24 h before use. HeLa cells stably expressing HA-tagged wild-type or P18A/P144A/P160A forms of Spry2 were seeded in 35-mm dishes at 300,000 cells/dish. After 24 h, media above cells were switched to normoxic or hypoxic media, and cells were grown for an additional 24 h. One dish from each set was lysed for t = 0 time point before the addition of 200 μm cycloheximide to stop protein synthesis. Thereafter, at the indicated times, cells were lysed in reducing Laemmli sample buffer, and amount of HA-Spry2 was analyzed by Western blotting. HeLa cells stably expressing HA-Spry2 were seeded at 300,000 cells/dish into 35-mm dishes. The next day, the media were changed, and PHD inhibitors (50 or 200 μm DMOG and 20 or 40 μm DFO) were added to cells cultured under normoxic conditions. After 24 h, cells were lysed, and levels of HA-Spry2 were monitored. HeLa cells were seeded at 300,000 cells into 35-mm dishes and transfected the following day using the TransIT-HeLa MONSTER transfection kit (Mirus, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Each dish received 1 μg of pCMV-3×-FLAG-PHD1, pCMV-3×-FLAG-PHD2, or pCMV-3×-FLAG-3-PHD3 constructs along with 250 ng of pHM6-HA-Spry2. After 24 h, the media were changed with that equilibrated under normoxia (21% O2) or hypoxia (3% O2), and cells were incubated for an additional day under normoxic or hypoxic conditions before collecting lysate. For studies with pVHL, HEK293T cells were seeded at 200,000 cells/dish and co-transfected 24 h later with 250 ng of pHM6-HA-Spry2 plus increasing amounts of pCS2+MT-6×-Myc-VHL vector (from 62.5 ng to 1.5 μg) using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Total plasmid concentration was kept constant by adding appropriate amounts of empty pCS2+MT vector. Lysates were prepared in reducing Laemmli buffer and analyzed by immunoblotting. HEK293T cells (200,000/35-mm dish) were co-transfected with 250 ng of pHM6-HA-Spry2 and one of the shRNAs (1 μg each) against PHD1 (shRNA#26, catalog no. RHS3979-9589734, or shRNA#27, catalog no. RHS3979-9589735) or PHD3 (shRNA#47, catalog no. RHS3979-9569478, or shRNA#50, catalog no. RHS3979-9569481) using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent. Media were changed the following day, and cell lysates were collected after another 48 h. The nonsilencing pKLO shRNA served as control. To silence pVHL, HeLa cells stably expressing HA-Spry2 were transfected with 20 nm each of two different 25-mer siRNA duplex against pVHL of the following sequence: VHL#4, sense 5′-GCUCUACGAAGAUCUGGAAGACCAC-3′ and antisense 5′-GUGGUCUUCCAGAUCUUCGUAGAGCGA-3′. A mutant 27-mer Spry2 siRNA containing three ribonucleotide substitutions was used as a control as described previously (44Edwin F. Patel T.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 3181-3190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). All siRNA were designed and purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies Inc. To IP FLAG-PHDs, 500,000 HEK293T cells were seeded in 60-mm dishes and co-transfected with 1.5 μg of pCMV-3×-FLAG-PHD1–3 and 1.5 μg of pHM6-HA-Spry2 constructs using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent. The following day, cells were exposed to normoxic (21% O2) or hypoxic (3% O2) media and incubated for an additional 24 h under normoxic or hypoxic conditions. Cells were washed one time with ice-cold PBS, lysed in Lysis Buffer as described previously (11Poppleton H.M. Edwin F. Jaggar L. Ray R. Johnson L.R. Patel T.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 323: 98-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), and rotated for 30 min at 4 °C. Lysates were spun at 13,000 × g for 10 min, and 500 μg were pre-cleared with protein G beads (Millipore) for 1 h rotating at 4 °C. FLAG-PHD1–3 was immunoprecipitated with 1 μg of anti-FLAG M2 antibody (Sigma) bound to protein G beads (Millipore) by rotating overnight at 4 °C. The next day, beads were washed three times with Lysis Buffer and heated at 95 °C for 5 min in 30 μl of reducing Laemmli buffer to collect bound proteins. To examine HA-Spry2 interaction with endogenous PHD1, HeLa cells stably expressing HA-Spry2 were seeded in 10-cm dishes at 1.5 × 106 density and left under normoxic conditions for 24 h. Cells were then exposed to 16 h of normoxia (21% O2) or hypoxia (3% O2) and lysed. The IP procedure was as described above, except HA polyclonal antibody (Sigma) was used to IP HA-Spry2. IP experiments with 6×-Myc-VHL were as described above, except the cells were co-transfected with 1.5 μg of pHM6-HA-Spry2 and pCS2+MT-6×-Myc-VHL vector. The cells were then treated with 25 μm MG132 for 4 h before IP of 6×-Myc-VHL with the anti-c-Myc monoclonal (Covance, Emeryville, CA). HEK293T cells (500,000/60-mm dish) were cultured for 24 h prior to transfection with 2 μg of control GIPZ shRNA (catalog no. RHS4346) or VHLshRNA#4 (catalog no. RHS4430-98521242), 2 μg of pCMV-3×-FLAG-ubiquitin, and 750 ng of pHM6-HA-Spry2 using FuGENE 6. After 48 h of transfection, the media were changed, and the dishes were left for another 16 h. Cells were treated with MG132 (25 μm) for 4 h at 37 °C before washing two times with ice-cold PBS. A 500-μl aliquot of Lysis Buffer containing 25 μm MG132 and 5 mm N-ethylmaleimide was used to lyse cells. HA-Spry2 was immunoprecipitated from 500 μg of cell lysate using 1 μg of anti-HA monoclonal antibody (Covance) bound to protein G beads for 2 h at 4 °C. The subsequent wash and elution steps from beads were as described above. For 6×-Myc-VHL add-back experiments, HEK293T cells were first transfected with 1.5 μg of control GIPZ shRNA or pVHL shRNA#4 for 24 h using FuGENE 6 reagent. A second transfection was then performed with 1.5 μg of pCMV-3×-FLAG-ubiquitin, 1.7 μg of pCS2+MT-6×-Myc-VHL, and 550 ng of pHM6-HA-Spry2. After 8 h, the media were changed, and cells were left to incubate for another 16 h. IP of HA-Spry2 was as described above. HEK293T cells were seeded into 35-mm dishes at 200,000 cells per dish. The following day, cells were co-transfected with 1 μg of PHD1 shRNA#27 and 250 ng of pHM6-HA-Spry2 using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent and returned to the incubator. After 24 h, cells were washed once with PBS and serum-starved for 16 h before addition of FGF. Cells were stimulated with 150 ng/ml FGF for 5, 10, 30, or 60 min then lysed in reducing Laemmli buffer to stop stimulation. pVHL was knocked down with pVHL siRNA#4, and conditions for stimulation were as described for PHD1 shRNA, except the cells were stimulated with FGF for the indicated times. To facilitate the interpretation of our data concerning the post-translational regulation of Spry levels without interference from changes in its transcription, our studies were performed with exogenously expressed Spry isoforms under the control of CMV promoter in HeLa cells. All of the results described below were obtained from more than one stably transfected HeLa clonal cell line or with transient transfection of Spry2 in HeLa cells. Hypoxia (3% O2) increased the amounts of all moderately overexpressed HA-Spry isoforms (Fig. 1A). Using stably transfected HeLa cells that express moderate amounts of HA-Spry2, we found that this increase is due to a decrease in Spry2 degradation during hypoxia (Fig. 1B). Controls with constructs of other proteins (e.g. RSK1) in the same plasmid showed that the activity of the CMV promoter is not altered by hypoxia (supplemental Fig. S1A). Like the N-terminally tagged Spry2 in HeLa cells, the amount of endogenous Spry2 in LS174T cells (Fig. 1C) and HEP3B cells (supplemental Fig. S2) was also higher in hypoxia. A recent report has shown that hypoxia increases the transcription of Spry4 suggesting that the Spry4 promoter has some elements that are regulated by transcriptional factors activated in hypoxia (45Haigl B. Mayer C.E. Siegwart G. Sutterlüty H. Biol. Chem. 2010; 391: 813-821Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because hypoxia increases HIF1α levels, we determined whether or not the stability of Spry2 in hypoxia was regulated by this transcription factor. Despite significant (∼80%) silencing of HIF1α, the amount of Spry2 in hypoxia was not altered (supplemental Fig. S3). Hence, elevations in HIF1α subunit do not regulate stability of Spry2 in hypoxia. In normoxia, HIFα subunits and β2-adrenergic receptor are hydroxylated on Pro residues by PHD1–3 (38Xie L. Xiao K. Whalen E.J. Forrester M.T. Freeman R.S. Fong G. Gygi S.P. Lefkowitz R.J.

https://openalex.org/W2114640216,"Here, we report on the complete genome sequence of the hyperthermophilic Crenarchaeum Thermoproteus tenax (strain Kra1, DSM 2078(T)) a type strain of the crenarchaeotal order Thermoproteales. Its circular 1.84-megabase genome harbors no extrachromosomal elements and 2,051 open reading frames are identified, covering 90.6% of the complete sequence, which represents a high coding density. Derived from the gene content, T. tenax is a representative member of the Crenarchaeota. The organism is strictly anaerobic and sulfur-dependent with optimal growth at 86°C and pH 5.6. One particular feature is the great metabolic versatility, which is not accompanied by a distinct increase of genome size or information density as compared to other Crenarchaeota. T. tenax is able to grow chemolithoautotrophically (CO₂/H₂) as well as chemoorganoheterotrophically in presence of various organic substrates. All pathways for synthesizing the 20 proteinogenic amino acids are present. In addition, two presumably complete gene sets for NADH:quinone oxidoreductase (complex I) were identified in the genome and there is evidence that either NADH or reduced ferredoxin might serve as electron donor. Beside the typical archaeal A₀A₁-ATP synthase, a membrane-bound pyrophosphatase is found, which might contribute to energy conservation. Surprisingly, all genes required for dissimilatory sulfate reduction are present, which is confirmed by growth experiments. Mentionable is furthermore, the presence of two proteins (ParA family ATPase, actin-like protein) that might be involved in cell division in Thermoproteales, where the ESCRT system is absent, and of genes involved in genetic competence (DprA, ComF) that is so far unique within Archaea."
https://openalex.org/W2137199997,"There is a consistent demand for new biosensors for the detection of protein targets, and a systematic method for the rapid development of new sensors is needed. Here we present a platform where short unstructured peptides that bind to a desired target are selected using M13 phage display. The selected peptides are then chemically synthesized and immobilized on gold, allowing for detection of the target using electrochemical techniques such as electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). A quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) is also used as a diagnostic tool during biosensor development. We demonstrate the utility of this approach by creating a novel peptide-based electrochemical biosensor for the enzyme alanine aminotransferase (ALT), a well-known biomarker of hepatotoxicity. Biopanning of the M13 phage display library over immobilized ALT, led to the rapid identification of a new peptide (ALT5-8) with an amino acid sequence of WHWRNPDFWYLK. Phage particles expressing this peptide exhibited nanomolar affinity for immobilized ALT (Kd,app = 85±20 nM). The newly identified ALT5-8 peptide was then chemically synthesized with a C-terminal cysteine for gold immobilization. The performance of the gold-immobilized peptides was studied with cyclic voltammetry (CV), QCM, and EIS. Using QCM, the sensitivity for ALT detection was 8.9±0.9 Hz/(µg/mL) and the limit of detection (LOD) was 60 ng/mL. Using EIS measurements, the sensitivity was 142±12 impedance percentage change %/(µg/mL) and the LOD was 92 ng/mL. In both cases, the LOD was below the typical concentration of ALT in human blood. Although both QCM and EIS produced similar LODs, EIS is preferable due to a larger linear dynamic range. Using QCM, the immobilized peptide exhibited a nanomolar dissociation constant for ALT (Kd = 20.1±0.6 nM). These results demonstrate a simple and rapid platform for developing and assessing the performance of sensitive, peptide-based biosensors for new protein targets."
https://openalex.org/W2062478833,"Development of new opioid drugs that provide analgesia without producing dependence is important for pain treatment. Opioid agonist drugs exert their analgesia effects primarily by acting at the mu opioid receptor (MOR) sites. High-resolution differentiation of opioid ligands is crucial for the development of new lead drug candidates with better tolerance profiles. Here, we use a label-free integrative pharmacology on-target (iPOT) approach to characterize the functional selectivity of a library of known opioid ligands for the MOR. This approach is based on the ability to detect dynamic mass redistribution (DMR) arising from the activation of the MOR in living cells. DMR assays were performed in HEK-MOR cells with and without preconditioning with probe molecules using label-free resonant waveguide grating biosensors, wherein the probe molecules were used to modify the activity of specific signaling proteins downstream the MOR. DMR signals obtained were then translated into high resolution heat maps using similarity analysis based on a numerical matrix of DMR parameters. Our data indicate that the iPOT approach clearly differentiates functional selectivity for distinct MOR signaling pathways among different opioid ligands, thus opening new avenues to discover and quantify the functional selectivity of currently used and novel opioid receptor drugs."
https://openalex.org/W1993456450,"Negotiation and trade typically require a mutual interaction while simultaneously resting in uncertainty which decision the partner ultimately will make at the end of the process. Assessing already during the negotiation in which direction one's counterpart tends would provide a tremendous advantage. Recently, neuroimaging techniques combined with multivariate pattern classification of the acquired data have made it possible to discriminate subjective states of mind on the basis of their neuronal activation signature. However, to enable an online-assessment of the participant's mind state both approaches need to be extended to a real-time technique. By combining real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and online pattern classification techniques, we show that it is possible to predict human behavior during social interaction before the interacting partner communicates a specific decision. Average accuracy reached approximately 70% when we predicted online the decisions of volunteers playing the ultimatum game, a well-known paradigm in economic game theory. Our results demonstrate the successful online analysis of complex emotional and cognitive states using real-time fMRI, which will enable a major breakthrough for social fMRI by providing information about mental states of partners already during the mutual interaction. Interestingly, an additional whole brain classification across subjects confirmed the online results: anterior insula, ventral striatum, and lateral orbitofrontal cortex, known to act in emotional self-regulation and reward processing for adjustment of behavior, appeared to be strong determinants of later overt behavior in the ultimatum game. Using whole brain classification we were also able to discriminate between brain processes related to subjective emotional and motivational states and brain processes related to the evaluation of objective financial incentives."
https://openalex.org/W2069864570,"Pore-forming toxins constitute a class of potent virulence factors that attack their host membrane in a two- or three-step mechanism. After binding to the membrane, often aided by specific receptors, they form pores in the membrane. Pore formation either unfolds a cytolytic activity in itself or provides a pathway to introduce enzymes into the cells that act upon intracellular proteins. The elucidation of the pore-forming mechanism of many of these toxins represents a major research challenge. As the toxins often refold after entering the membrane, their structure in the membrane is unknown, and key questions such as the stoichiometry of individual pores and their mechanism of oligomerization remain unanswered. In this study, we used single subunit counting based on fluorescence spectroscopy to explore the oligomerization process of the Cry1Aa toxin of Bacillus thuringiensis. Purified Cry1Aa toxin molecules labeled at different positions in the pore-forming domain were inserted into supported lipid bilayers, and the photobleaching steps of single fluorophores in the fluorescence time traces were counted to determine the number of subunits of each oligomer. We found that toxin oligomerization is a highly dynamic process that occurs in the membrane and that tetramers represent the final form of the toxins in a lipid bilayer environment.

Pore-forming toxins are endogenous and potentially harmful proteins synthesized in a wide variety of bacteria, plants, and animals (1Alouf J.E. Popoff M.R. The Comprehensive Sourcebook of Bacterial Protein Toxins. 3rd Ed. Elsevier, Amsterdam, The Netherlands2006Google Scholar). Their specificity for certain hosts permits the use of pore-forming toxins as biopesticides or in medical treatment. Several toxins produced by Bacillus thuringiensis are widely used biological alternatives to chemical pesticides due to their specificity for certain insects of various orders, their low persistence in the environment, the absence of effects on mammals and humans, and the slow onset of resistance in target organisms (for review, see Ref. 2Schnepf E.

Like other B. thuringiensis toxins, Cry1Aa, which is toxic only to Lepidoptera insects, is ingested by larvae as a protoxin and activated by proteases in the midgut of the larvae (3Höfte H. Whiteley H.R. Microbiol. Rev. 1989; 53: 242-255Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).

However, little information is available on the final architecture of the functional pores, i.e. whether they are monomeric or oligomeric and, in the latter case, how many subunits make up the pores and whether oligomerization takes place before or after membrane insertion. Several studies have approached the question of B. thuringiensis toxin oligomerization in solution and in receptor-free artificial membranes. In solution, B. thuringiensis toxin oligomers or aggregates of a large range of sizes have been observed (17Walters F.S. Kulesza C.A. Phillips A.T. English L.H. Insect Biochem. Mol.

In receptor-free bilayers, a number of different B. thuringiensis toxins formed ion channels with principal conductances of several hundreds of picosiemens, but smaller conducting levels down to a few picosiemens were also observed, indicative of the presence of conducting substates, smaller size channels of a lower order of oligomerization, or both (7Peyronnet O.

It was proposed that these channels formed clusters of various sizes that gated cooperatively, resulting in multiple conductance states. On the other hand, trimers of Cry4Ba toxin, but also monomers and dimers, were detected in liposomes by SDS-PAGE analysis (27Likitvivatanavong S. Katzenmeier G. Angsuthanasombat C. Arch. Biochem.

This intercalation of the hairpin preceded pore formation, suggesting an intermediate step, which might be lateral diffusion and oligomerization.

AFM measurements visualized a depression with a diameter of ∼15 Å surrounded by four elements, each of which had a diameter of ∼14 Å corresponding to the size of single α-helices or hairpin loops. The observed structures are thus consistent with a tetrameric stoichiometry as proposed previously (14Masson L. Tabashnik B.E. Liu Y.B. Brousseau R. Schwartz J.L. J. Biol.

Nevertheless, each Cry1Aa toxin contains seven α-helices and consequently five loops in pore-forming domain I, rendering it impossible to predict how many toxin molecules contribute to each pore-forming unit without additional information. Furthermore, the same toxin is suggested to form trimeric complexes in two-dimensional membrane-associated toxin crystals, as revealed by electron microscopy (31Ounjai P. Unger V.M. Sigworth F.J.

In this work, we set out to determine the number of subunits that compose the Cry1Aa oligomers using a single molecule fluorescence approach based on photobleaching step analysis (33Ulbrich M.H.

Because single fluorophores photobleach in a step-like behavior, the number of photobleaching steps occurring in a single labeled protein is equivalent to the number of fluorophores attached to it. In our case, each toxin monomer was labeled with a single fluorophore. Therefore, the number of photobleaching steps indicated how many subunits were present in individual Cry1Aa oligomers. Our results show that Cry1Aa forms tetramers in artificial membranes and suggest that oligomerization takes place after insertion into the lipid bilayer. Cry1Aa constructs in plasmid vectors pMP39 and pBA1 were described previously (8Groulx N. Juteau M. Blunck R. J. Gen. Physiol. 2010; 136: 497-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 38Masson L. Préfontaine G. Péloquin L. Lau P.C. Brousseau R. Biochem. J. 1990; 269: 507-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). To monitor the fluorescence emission from fluorescently labeled Cry1Aa subunits using thiol-reactive fluorophores, cysteines were introduced into domain I by site-directed mutagenesis at Phe-50 and Pro-121 in the loops located between helices α1 and α2 and helices α3 and α4, respectively. Mutations were inserted using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene) and amplified using Qiagen miniprep kits following standard protocols. Constructs were sequenced to verify mutations. Both mutants were transformed into B. thuringiensis strain Cry HD-73. The bacteria were grown for 72 h at 37 °C in yeast-tryptone medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin. Protoxins were solubilized and trypsin-activated, and toxins were purified by fast protein liquid chromatography as described previously (38Masson L. Préfontaine G. Péloquin L. Lau P.C. Brousseau R. Biochem. J. 1990; 269: 507-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Purity was verified by SDS gel electrophoresis. All mutants were labeled with a 10-fold excess of tetramethylrhodamine-5-maleimide (Invitrogen) for 60 min. Unbound dye was removed by buffer exchange using Amicon concentrators (30 kDa; Millipore). The labeling ratio was determined by comparing the protein concentration (Bradford assay, Pierce) with the fluorophore concentration (absorption). The average labeling ratio after washing was 0.76 ± 0.02. WT Cry1Aa had low unspecific labeling (0.06 ± 0.03; see “Results”). Unilamellar vesicles (2.5 mg/ml lipid) were formed from 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine (POPC) and 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylethanolamine (POPE) at a 1:1 mass ratio or from 1,2-diphytanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPhPC) (all from Avanti Polar Lipids) in experiment buffer (100 mm KCl, 10 mm Hepes, and 1 mm CaCl2, pH 7) using the same method as described previously (35Blunck R. McGuire H. Hyde H.C. Bezanilla F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 20263-20268Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). All mutants were finally reconstituted in unilamellar vesicles at concentrations of 0.17–2.33 μg/ml diluted from a stock solution of 33 μg/ml in experiment buffer. Preparations were sonicated and vortexed briefly to allow proper mixing and incubated overnight at 4 °C prior to measurements. Borosilicate glass coverslips were washed by a 30-min sonication in different solvents in the following order: Alconox (Fisher), acetone, and anhydrous ethanol. Between each step, the coverslips were rinsed with H2O (Milli-Q, filtered at 0.2 μm). Coverslips were stored in H2O and dried under a steady N2 stream immediately before use. At recording intensities below 1.5 milliwatts, almost no background fluorescence was detected from the top of the coverslip. 5 μl of mutant/vesicle mixture was added to 400 μl of experiment buffer on a clean coverslip. After 45 min, the vesicles formed supported bilayers on the coverslip, and excess vesicles were carefully washed off with experiment buffer using a micropipette. Fluorescence was measured using an Axiovert 200 inverted microscope (Zeiss). A 30-milliwatt 532-nm laser (World Star Tech) was selected as the excitation source. Excitation light (<1.5 milliwatt) was defocused to a diameter of ≈10 mm. Emission was collected with a 63× numerical aperture 1.4 objective (Zeiss) and filtered using a 610/75-nm emission filter in combination with a Z532 dichroic mirror (Chroma Technologies). Images were recorded with an EMCCD camera (iXon+ 860BV, Andor Technology) (see Fig. 1B). To ensure complete photobleaching of the spots, each fluorescence recording was acquired until the image had reached a stable emission level (background, ∼5 min). Images were analyzed using a MATLAB routine (MathWorks) written in-house. The intensity of a single pixel spot was plotted over time and further analyzed regarding whether it met the selection criteria: only spots that showed clear photobleaching steps were considered to ensure that only single oligomers were observed (see below). We occasionally observed modulation of fluorescence intensity, which might have been caused by blinking or movement of the protein/fluorophore. Although these traces were included in the analysis of the number of photobleaching steps, the fluorescence modulation itself was not further analyzed, as we were interested only in the stoichiometry of the pore. For every trace analyzed, we determined the number of photobleaching steps because they correspond to the number of labeled subunits forming a toxin oligomer (33Ulbrich M.H. Isacoff E.Y. Nat. Methods. 2007; 4: 319-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar, 35Blunck R. McGuire H. Hyde H.C. Bezanilla F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 20263-20268Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Subunit counting statistics were first fitted to a Poisson distribution (Equation 1),P(k)=e−λλkk!(Eq. 1) where P(k) represents the Poisson distribution probability as a function of k, and λ denotes the average number of subunits. The Poisson distribution provides information on the average number of subunits within stochastically distributed oligomers. On the other hand, the binomial distribution is suitable only if the oligomerization results in a specific number of subunits,P(k)=(nk)⋅pkqn−k(Eq. 2) where P(k) represents the binomial distribution probability as a function of k, n is the number of subunits expected, p represents the probability of detecting an existing subunit, and q = (1 −p), the probability of not detecting it (photobleached or not labeled). Fitting was done by least squares optimization. Our aim was to establish whether we can deduce, from the observed distribution of photobleaching steps, the stoichiometry, if any, of the Cry1Aa pores. To this end, the toxins were fluorescently labeled using thiol-reactive chemistry, and supported bilayers were formed on the surface of glass coverslips from liposomes containing the labeled Cry1Aa toxins in variable concentrations between 0.17 and 2.33 μg/ml. Within this concentration range (1.95–2.6 μg/ml), pore formation has been observed in receptor-free planar lipid bilayers (8Groulx N. Juteau M. Blunck R. J. Gen. Physiol. 2010; 136: 497-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In the presence of receptors, this concentration was reduced to 0.2–1.1 μg/ml (32Schwartz J.L. Lu Y.J. Söhnlein P. Brousseau R. Laprade R. Masson L. Adang M.J. FEBS Lett. 1997; 412: 270-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). When directly injected into the midgut of insect larvae, the LC50 was ∼7 μg/ml (39van Frankenhuyzen K. Gringorten J.L. Milne R.E. Gauthier D. Pusztai M. Brousseau R. Masson L. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1991; 57: 1650-1655Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Distinct fluorescent spots were observed in the supported bilayer. The measurement of the efficiency of labeling (EOL) at 0.76 ± 0.02 (i.e. the number of fluorophores/monomer; see “Experimental Procedures”) established that not more than one fluorophore was attached to each monomer, meaning that each photobleaching event corresponds to a single subunit (monomer) (Fig. 1D). However, the number of bleaching steps is only the minimal number of subunits found in each oligomer, as not every subunit is observed via fluorescence due to incomplete labeling or previous photobleaching. We found previously that the labeled Cry1Aa toxins form pores in planar lipid bilayers like the wild-type toxin (8Groulx N. Juteau M. Blunck R. J. Gen. Physiol. 2010; 136: 497-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Fluorescence from tetramethylrhodamine-5-maleimide-labeled Cry1Aa toxins observed from the supported bilayer using epifluorescence was found to display fluorescence intensity in distinct spots distributed over the entire field of view (49 × 49 μm2) (Fig. 1C). Experiments were performed with Cry1Aa mutants F50C and P121C using two different lipid compositions, POPE/POPC (1:1) and DPhPC, to verify whether the observed oligomerization distribution is specific either to the labeling position in the pore-forming domain or to the lipid composition (fluidity). We analyzed the photobleaching behavior of the single spots. Most spots displayed a step-like photobleaching behavior, which confirmed that each spot contained only a few fluorophores (Fig. 1D). The exceptions were a few spots that fluoresced very intensely and followed an exponential bleaching behavior. These spots were likely caused by aggregated toxins or other impurities in the sample and were thus excluded from further analysis. We also excluded spots that were not fully bleached after the entire bleaching period (5 min) or where toxins moved during the exposure time as well as when the baseline did not remain constant. In those cases, the number of bleaching steps could not be confidently determined. The observed spots were specific to the labeled toxins. Background measurements in the absence of toxins showed a low number of spots (14 ± 2). In presence of labeled wild-type Cry1Aa, which contains no endogenous cysteines, we found 110 ± 16 spots, which was ∼5.5 times lower than the number observed in the presence of labeled mutants. This ratio was consistent with the level of unspecific labeling (1:13) resulting in ratios in the range of 6.3 and 2.6 if the proteins contained two and six subunits, respectively. Although the unspecific labeling only slightly influences the histograms (the probability of finding two nonspecifically attached fluorophores in one oligomer is <0.6%), we will consider its influence below. We determined the number of bleaching steps for each fluorescent spot from reconstituted toxin preparations at increasing concentrations between 0.17 and 2.33 μg/ml and analyzed the histograms representing the number of bleaching steps found under the different conditions. At even higher concentrations (>2.33 μg/ml), the spot density was close to the spatial resolution limit such that the spots were no longer distinct from one another. The photobleaching step size was not always equidistant, and a certain variability was observed also within one oligomer. This effect has been described previously (40Ding H. Wong P.T. Lee E.L. Gafni A. Steel D.G. Biophys. J. 2009; 97: 912-921Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 41Lenn T. Gkekas C.N. Bernard L. Engl C. Jovanovic G. Buck M. Ying L.Y. Chem.

J. 2011; 101: 535-544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The fluorescence intensity is influenced by a number of parameters, including environmental properties, relative orientation, and homotransfer efficiency. The Cry toxin is a dynamic protein, suggesting that the fluorophores may dwell in more than one physical state. The type of distribution found in the histograms will give us information about the oligomerization. A randomly composed oligomer would follow a Poisson distribution, whereas an oligomer with a defined stoichiometry would rather display a binomial distribution. We therefore fitted the histograms of bleaching steps to both a Poisson distribution (Equation 1; see “Photobleaching Data Analysis”), by minimizing the difference between the data and the fit as a function of the average (λ), and to binomial distributions for different number of subunits, n (dimer, trimer, tetramer, etc.; Equation 2). For the binomial distributions, an additional fit parameter, p, was introduced, representing the probability of observing an existing subunit with fluorescence. Although it is related to the EOL, its value remains slightly lower because photobleaching prior to the measurement occurred to a certain extent. At the lowest concentration (0.17 μg/ml), both toxin mutants photobleached to the greatest part in a single step (67.5 ± 3.3%) in both lipid compositions (Fig. 2, A and B, and supplemental Fig. 1, A and B) with a lower occurrence of dimers, trimers, and tetramers (averages of 24.2 ± 2.4, 6.6 ± 0.8, and 1.8 ± 0.7%, respectively). These results show that only minimal variations were observed between the different mutants and lipid environments. We found this to be consistent in all our measurements. A Poisson distribution with λ = 1.07 ± 0.04 was the best fit to our results. Even though a binomial distribution with the number of subunits (n) equal to 4, 5, and 6 also fits the distribution, the associated probability (p) would have to be too low in each case (<0.26) (see supplemental Table 1 for all results). As this is significantly lower than the EOL, a random number of subunits (as described by the Poisson distribution) seems to be the most likely interpretation. With increasing concentrations of toxin in the bilayer, a shift in the distribution can be observed with both toxin mutants F50C and P121C and independent of the lipid composition (Fig. 2, A and B, and supplemental Fig. 1, A and B). Toward the highest concentration used here, the number of monomers observed decreased, and the distribution shifted steadily toward an increased number of trimers and tetramers and a low number of pentamers. Interestingly, a steep drop occurred between tetramers and pentamers, and hexamers were observed only twice among a total of 9129 spots that were analyzed. It appeared that the type of distribution observed with increasing concentrations was shifting from a Poisson type to a binomial one (Fig. 3A). At a low concentration (<0.81 μg/ml), the optimized p values were for a binomial distribution of the number of labeled subunits/oligomer were still lower than 0.38 ± 0.03. This value was significantly different from the EOL value, meaning that there was no defined stoichiometry at low toxin concentrations, and up to concentrations of 0.81 μg/ml, the distribution was most appropriately described by a Poisson distribution. In contrast, the histograms were best fitted by a binomial distribution at higher concentrations, at which the distributions significantly deviated from Poisson distributions (Fig. 3A). This suggests that the toxins now assume a defined stoichiometry. The high number of four photobleaching steps that we found in the histograms excludes a dimeric and trimeric stoichiometry. Intuitively, one would presume a tetrameric pore-forming entity; however, as we still found a low number of five subunits, tetrameric, pentameric, or hexameric (n = 4, 5 and 6) structures would be possible models. Fitting the distributions to binomial distributions resulted in values of p, the probability of a subunit being detected, significantly lower than the EOL (p < 0.5) for n = 5 and 6. This and the steep drop from four to five observed steps would argue against oligomers with more than four subunits. To obtain a more objective measure whether the pore-forming entity is inde"

Dko mice expressing the transgene (nNOS TG+/dko) experienced delayed onset of mortality and increased life-span. The nNOS TG+/dko mice demonstrated a significant decrease in the concentration of CD163+, M2c macrophages that can express arginase and promote fibrosis. The decrease in M2c macrophages was associated with a significant reduction in fibrosis of heart, diaphragm and hindlimb muscles of nNOS TG+/dko mice. The nNOS transgene had no effect on the concentration of cytolytic, CD68+, M1 macrophages. Accordingly, we did not observe any change in the extent of muscle fiber lysis in the nNOS TG+/dko mice. These findings show that nNOS/NO (nitric oxide)-mediated decreases in M2c macrophages lead to a reduction in the muscle fibrosis that is associated with increased mortality in mice lacking dystrophin and utrophin. Interestingly, the dramatic and beneficial effects of the nNOS transgene were not attributable to localization of nNOS protein at the cell membrane. We did not detect any nNOS protein at the sarcolemma in nNOS TG+/dko muscles. This important observation shows that sarcolemmal localization is not necessary for nNOS to have beneficial effects in dystrophic tissue and the presence of nNOS in the cytosol of dystrophic muscle fibers can ameliorate the pathology and most importantly, significantly increase life-span."
https://openalex.org/W2022843244,"Background The dentate gyrus of the hippocampus is one of the regions in which neurogenesis takes place in the adult brain. We have previously demonstrated that CCAAT/enhancer binding protein β (C/EBPβ) is expressed in the granular layer of the dentate gyrus of the adult mouse hippocampus. Taking into account the important role of C/EBPβ in the consolidation of long term memory, the fact that newborn neurons in the hippocampus contribute to learning and memory processes, and the role of this transcription factor, previously demonstrated by our group, in regulating neuronal differentiation, we speculated that this transcription factor could regulate stem/progenitor cells in this region of the brain. Methodology/Principal Findings Here, we show, using C/EBPβ knockout mice, that C/EBPβ expression is observed in the subset of newborn cells that proliferate in the hippocampus of the adult brain. Mice lacking C/EBPβ present reduced survival of newborn cells in the hippocampus, a decrease in the number of these cells that differentiate into neurons and a diminished number of cells that are proliferating in the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus. These results were further confirmed in vitro. Neurosphere cultures from adult mice deficient in C/EBPβ present less proliferation and neuronal differentiation than neurospheres derived from wild type mice. Conclusions/Significance In summary, using in vivo and in vitro strategies, we have identified C/EBPβ as a key player in the proliferation and survival of the new neurons produced in the adult mouse hippocampus. Our results support a novel role of C/EBPβ in the processes of adult hippocampal neurogenesis, providing new insights into the mechanisms that control neurogenesis in this region of the brain."

Elucidating the molecular response of arteries to injury and age will help understand the exaggerated remodeling of aging vessels. Methodology/Principal Findings We studied the gene expression profile in a model of mechanical vascular injury in the iliac artery of aging (22 months old) and young rats (4 months old). We investigated aging-related variations in gene expression at 30 min, 3 d and 7 d post injury. We found that the Myosin Light Chain gene (MYL9) was the only gene differentially expressed in the aged versus young injured arteries at all time points studied, peaking at day 3 after injury (4.6 fold upregulation (p<0.05) in the smooth muscle cell layers. We confirmed this finding on an aging aortic microarray experiment available through NCBI's GEO database. We found that Myl9 was consistently upregulated with age in healthy rat aortas. To determine the arterial localization of Myl9 with age and injury, we performed immunohistochemistry for Myl9 in rat iliac arteries and found that in healthy and injured (30 days post injury) arteries, Myl9 expression increased with age in the endothelial layers. Conclusions/Significance The consistent upregulation of the myosin light chain protein (Myl9) with age and injury in arterial tissue draws attention to the increased vascular permeability and to the age-caused predisposition to arterial constriction after balloon angioplasty."

We investigated in two experiments whether the perception of whole body expressions and the perception of voices influence each other when observers are not aware of seeing the bodily expression. In the first experiment participants categorized masked happy and angry bodily expressions while ignoring congruent or incongruent emotional voices. The onset between target and mask varied from −50 to +133 ms. Results show that the congruency between the emotion in the voice and the bodily expressions influences audiovisual perception independently of the visibility of the stimuli. In the second experiment participants categorized the emotional voices combined with masked bodily expressions as fearful or happy. This experiment showed that bodily expressions presented outside visual awareness still influence prosody perception. Our experiments show that audiovisual integration between bodily expressions and affective prosody can take place outside and independent of visual awareness.

Mutations within K17 are responsible for two rare diseases related to ectodermal dysplasias. Studies in K17-null mice uncovered several roles for K17, including structural support, resistance to TNFα-induced apoptosis, regulation of protein synthesis, and modulation of cytokine expression. Yet, little is known about the regulation of K17 protein via post-translational modification. Here, we report that serine 44 in the N-terminal head domain of K17 (K17-Ser(44)) is phosphorylated in response to extracellular stimuli (serum, EGF, and the phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate) that alter skin keratinocyte growth, and to cellular stresses (sorbitol-induced hyperosmotic shock, UV irradiation, and hydrogen peroxide-induced oxidative stress). It also occurs in basaloid skin tumors in situ. Upon its stimulation in skin keratinocytes, K17-Ser(44) phosphorylation is induced rapidly but stays on transiently. The majority of the phosphorylated K17-Ser(44) pool is polymer-bound and is not obviously related to a change in filament organization. The amino acid sequence surrounding K17-Ser(44) matches the consensus for the AGC family of basophilic kinases. We show that p90 RSK1, an AGC kinase involved in the regulation of cell survival and proliferation, phosphorylates K17-Ser(44) in skin keratinocytes. These findings confirm and expand the tight link that has emerged between K17 up-regulation and growth and stress responses in the skin epithelium."

https://openalex.org/W2028269428,"Poliovirus RNA utilizes eIF2 for the initiation of translation in cell free systems. Remarkably, we now describe that poliovirus translation takes place at late times of infection when eIF2 is inactivated by phosphorylation. By contrast, translation directed by poliovirus RNA is blocked when eIF2 is inactivated at earlier times. Thus, poliovirus RNA translation exhibits a dual mechanism for the initiation of protein synthesis as regards to the requirement for eIF2. Analysis of individual poliovirus non-structural proteins indicates that the presence of 2A(pro) alone is sufficient to provide eIF2 independence for IRES-driven translation. This effect is not observed with a 2A(pro) variant unable to cleave eIF4G. The level of 2A(pro) synthesized in culture cells is crucial for obtaining eIF2 independence. Expression of the N-or C-terminus fragments of eIF4G did not stimulate IRES-driven translation, nor provide eIF2 independence, consistent with the idea that the presence of 2A(pro) at high concentrations is necessary. The finding that 2A(pro) provides eIF2-independent translation opens a new and unsuspected area of research in the field of picornavirus protein synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W2047479963,"Intrinsically disordered (ID) regions of proteins commonly exist within transcription factors, including the N-terminal domain (NTD) of steroid hormone receptors (SHRs) that possesses a powerful activation function, AF1 region. The mechanisms by which SHRs pass signals from a steroid hormone to control gene expression remain a central unresolved problem. The role of N-terminal activation function AF1, which exists in an intrinsically disordered (ID) conformation, in this process is of immense importance. It is hypothesized that under physiological conditions, ID AF1 undergoes disorder/order transition via inter- and intra-molecular communications, which allows AF1 surfaces to interact with specific co-regulatory proteins, critical for the final outcome of target gene expression regulated by SHRs. However, the means by which AF1 acquires functionally folded conformations is not well understood. In this study, we tested whether binding of jun dimerization protein 2 (JDP2) within the DNA binding domain (DBD) of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) leads to acquisition of functionally active structure in its AF1/NTD. Our results show that signals mediated from GR DBD:JDP2 interactions in a two domain GR fragment, consisting of the entire NTD and little beyond DBD, significantly increased secondary/tertiary structure formation in the NTD/AF1. This increased structure formation facilitated AF1's interaction with specific co-regulatory proteins and subsequent glucocorticoid response element-mediated AF1 promoter:reporter activity. These results support the hypothesis that inter- and intra-molecular signals give a functionally active structure(s) to the GR AF1, which is important for its transcriptional activity."
https://openalex.org/W2043249617,"Background Genetic studies have demonstrated a strong association between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at IL28B and response to treatment with peginterferon (PEG) and ribavirin (RBV) in HCV monoinfected persons. We sought to test these associations in a prospective PEG / weight based ribavirin (WBR) treatment trial (ACTG A5178) (National Institution of Health registration number NCT00078403) in persons with HCV-HIV coinfection, and to develop a prediction score. Methods We selected subjects enrolled in A5178 who completed at least the first 12 weeks of the trial and had DNA available, and genotyped three SNPs at IL28B (rs12979860, rs12980275, rs8099917). We used multivariate logistic regression analysis to evaluate the association between IL28B SNPs and HCV treatment outcomes and to develop the prediction score. Results 231 HCV/HIV coinfected subjects were included. We observed a strong association between IL28B genotype and response to therapy among those with genotypes 1 or 4 (odds ratio for complete early virologic responses (cEVR) and sustained virologic response (SVR) was 2.98 [1.7–5.3] and 3.4 [1.7–6.9], respectively, for each additional copy of the C allele of rs12979860). Differences in frequency of the responder allele explained some of the discrepancy in HCV treatment outcomes between blacks and whites. A simple pretreatment prediction score that incorporates the IL28B genotype and baseline HCV viral load has a 93% negative predictive value (NPV) for SVR. Conclusions IL28B SNPs have an additive allele dose effect in predicting HCV treatment outcomes in HCV/HIV coinfected persons and can be incorporated into a simple pretreatment prediction score that could minimize the risk of exposure to PEG/RBV therapy for persons with unfavorable scores."
https://openalex.org/W2039790095,"Small RNAs generated by RNA polymerase IV (Pol IV) are the most abundant class of small RNAs in flowering plants. In Arabidopsis thaliana Pol IV-dependent short interfering (p4-si)RNAs are imprinted and accumulate specifically from maternal chromosomes in the developing seeds. Imprinted expression of protein-coding genes is controlled by differential DNA or histone methylation placed in gametes. To identify epigenetic factors required for maternal-specific expression of p4-siRNAs we analyzed the effect of a series of candidate mutations, including those required for genomic imprinting of protein-coding genes, on uniparental expression of a representative p4-siRNA locus.Paternal alleles of imprinted genes are marked by DNA or histone methylation placed by DNA METHYLTRANSFERASE 1 or the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2. Here we demonstrate that repression of paternal p4-siRNA expression at locus 08002 is not controlled by either of these mechanisms. Similarly, loss of several chromatin modification enzymes, including a histone acetyltransferase, a histone methyltransferase, and two nucleosome remodeling proteins, does not affect maternal expression of locus 08002. Maternal alleles of imprinted genes are hypomethylated by DEMETER DNA glycosylase, yet expression of p4-siRNAs occurs irrespective of demethylation by DEMETER or related glycosylases.Differential DNA methylation and other chromatin modifications associated with epigenetic silencing are not required for maternal-specific expression of p4-siRNAs at locus 08002. These data indicate that there is an as yet unknown epigenetic mechanism causing maternal-specific p4-siRNA expression that is distinct from the well-characterized mechanisms associated with DNA methylation or the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2."
https://openalex.org/W2053620964,"At the onset of dynamic movements excitation of the motor cortex (M1) is spatially restricted to areas representing the involved muscles whereas adjacent areas are inhibited. The current study elucidates whether the cortical motor command for dynamic contractions is also restricted to a certain population of cortical neurons responsible for the fast corticospinal projections. Therefore, corticospinal transmission was assessed with high temporal resolution during dynamic contractions after both, magnetic stimulation over M1 and the brainstem. The high temporal resolution could be obtained by conditioning the soleus H-reflex with different interstimulus intervals by cervicomedullary stimulation (CMS-conditioning) and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of M1 (M1-conditioning). This technique provides a precise time course of facilitation and inhibition. CMS- and M1-conditioning produced an 'early facilitation' of the H-reflex, which occurred around 3 ms earlier with CMS-conditioning. The early facilitation is believed to be caused by activation of direct monosynaptic projections to the spinal motoneurons. CMS-conditioning resulted in a subsequent 'late facilitation', which is considered to reflect activity of slow-conducting and/or indirect corticospinal pathways. In contrast, M1-conditioning produced a 'late dis-facilitation' or even 'late inhibition'. As the late dis-facilitation was only seen following M1- but not CMS-conditioning, it is argued that cortical activation during dynamic tasks is restricted to fast, direct corticospinal projections whereas corticomotoneurons responsible for slow and/or indirectly projecting corticospinal pathways are inhibited. The functional significance of restricting the descending cortical drive to fast corticospinal pathways may be to ensure a temporally focused motor command during the execution of dynamic movements."
https://openalex.org/W1992338959,"Zcchc11 is a uridyltransferase protein with enzymatic activity directed against diverse RNA species. On the basis of its known uridylation targets, we hypothesized that Zcchc11 might regulate cell proliferation. Confirming this, loss-of-function and complementary gain-of-function experiments consistently revealed that Zcchc11 promotes the transition from G(1) to S phase of the cell cycle. This activity takes place through both Rb-dependent and Rb-independent mechanisms by promoting the expression of multiple G(1)-associated proteins, including cyclins D(1) and A and CDK4. Surprisingly, a Zcchc11 construct with point mutations inactivating the uridyltransferase domain enhanced cell proliferation as effectively as wild-type Zcchc11. Furthermore, truncated mutant constructs revealed that the cell cycle effects of Zcchc11 were driven by the N-terminal region of the protein that lacks the RNA-binding domains and uridyltransferase activity of the full protein. Therefore, the N-terminal portion of Zcchc11, which lacks nucleotidyltransferase capabilities, is biologically active and mediates a previously unrecognized role for Zcchc11 in facilitating cell proliferation."
https://openalex.org/W1992939358,"Inward rectifier potassium channels of the Kir2 subfamily are important determinants of the electrical activity of brain and muscle cells. Genetic mutations in Kir2.1 associate with Andersen-Tawil syndrome (ATS), a familial disorder leading to stress-triggered periodic paralysis and ventricular arrhythmia. To identify the molecular mechanisms of this stress trigger, we analyze Kir channel function and localization electrophysiologically and by time-resolved confocal microscopy. Furthermore, we employ a mathematical model of muscular membrane potential. We identify a novel corticoid signaling pathway that, when activated by glucocorticoids, leads to enrichment of Kir2 channels in the plasma membranes of mammalian cell lines and isolated cardiac and skeletal muscle cells. We further demonstrate that activation of this pathway can either partly restore (40% of cases) or further impair (20% of cases) the function of mutant ATS channels, depending on the particular Kir2.1 mutation. This means that glucocorticoid treatment might either alleviate or deteriorate symptoms of ATS depending on the patient's individual Kir2.1 genotype. Thus, our findings provide a possible explanation for the contradictory effects of glucocorticoid treatment on symptoms in patients with ATS and may open new pathways for the design of personalized medicines in ATS therapy.—Seebohm, G., Strutz-Seebohm, N., Ursu, O.

https://openalex.org/W2004026255,"Sic1, cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor of budding yeast, is synthesized in anaphase and largely degraded at the S-phase onset to regulate timing of DNA synthesis. Sic1 interacts with phase-specific B-type cyclin (Clb)-kinase (Cdk1) complexes, central regulators in cell cycle control. Its appearance is timed to mediate reduction in kinase activities at appropriate stages. Clbs are unstable proteins with extremely short half-lives. Interactions of Sic1 with Clbs have been detected both in vitro and in vivo by high-throughput genome-wide screenings. Furthermore, we have recently shown that Sic1 regulates waves of Clbs, acting as a timer in their appearance, thus controlling Cdk1-Clbs activation. The molecular mechanism is not yet fully understood but is hypothesized to occur via stoichiometric binding of Sic1 to Cdk1-Clb complexes. Using Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) via fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM), we showed association of Sic1 to Clb cyclins in living yeast cells. This finding is consistent with the notion that inhibition of kinase activity can occur over the whole cell cycle progression despite variable Sic1 levels. Specifically, Sic1/Clb3 interaction was observed for the first time, and Sic1/Clb2 and Sic1/Clb5 pairs were confirmed, but no Sic1/Clb4 interaction was found, which suggests that, despite high functional homology between Clbs, only some of them can target Sic1 function in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2010417785,"MAPK phosphatases (MKPs) are negative regulators of signaling pathways with distinct MAPK substrate specificities. For example, the yeast dual specificity phosphatase Msg5 dephosphorylates the Fus3 and Slt2 MAPKs operating in the mating and cell wall integrity pathways, respectively. Like other MAPK-interacting proteins, most MKPs bind MAPKs through specific docking domains. These include D-motifs, which contain basic residues that interact with acidic residues in the common docking (CD) domain of MAPKs. Here we show that Msg5 interacts not only with Fus3, Kss1, and Slt2 but also with the pseudokinase Slt2 paralog Mlp1. Using yeast two-hybrid and in vitro interaction assays, we have identified distinct regions within the N-terminal domain of Msg5 that differentially bind either the MAPKs Fus3 and Kss1 or Slt2 and Mlp1. Whereas a canonical D-site within Msg5 mediates interaction with the CD domains of Fus3 and Kss1, a novel motif (102IYT104) within Msg5 is involved in binding to Slt2 and Mlp1. Furthermore, mutation of this site prevents the phosphorylation of Msg5 by Slt2. This motif is conserved in Sdp1, another MKP that dephosphorylates Slt2, as well as in Msg5 orthologs from other yeast species. A region spanning amino acids 274–373 within Slt2 and Mlp1 mediates binding to this Msg5 motif in a CD domain-independent manner. In contrast, Slt2 uses its CD domain to bind to its upstream activator Mkk1. This binding flexibility may allow MAPK pathways to exploit additional regulatory controls in order to provide fine modulation of both pathway activity and specificity.

This binding flexibility may allow MAPK pathways to exploit additional regulatory controls in order to provide fine modulation of both pathway activity and specificity. Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways constitute very tightly regulated signaling modules that both transduce and convert extracellular stimuli into appropriate cellular responses. Mammalian MAPKs comprise four main subfamilies: the extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2), the c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs), the p38 MAPKs, and ERK5 (1Turjanski A.G. Vaqué J.P. Gutkind J.S. Oncogene. 2007; 26: 3240-3253Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). These MAPKs contain a highly conserved TXY motif in the kinase activation loop in which both threonine and tyrosine residues must be phosphorylated to achieve kinase activation. In contrast, atypical MAPKs, exemplified by ERK3 and ERK4, contain an SEG motif in which the serine residue is the sole phosphoacceptor (2Coulombe P. Meloche S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1773: 1376-1387Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Several mechanisms exist to ensure high efficiency and fidelity within each specific pathway. Among these, selective recognition by specific protein-protein interactions between the components of a particular pathway is critical for the maintenance of accurate signal transduction (3Tanoue T. Nishida E. Pharmacol. Ther. 2002; 93: 193-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 4Grewal S. Molina D.M. Bardwell L. Cell. Signal. 2006; 18: 123-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). MAPKs are activated through phosphorylation by MAPK kinases and phosphorylate a wide range of protein substrates, including transcription factors, protein kinases, and other cell response effectors. In turn, MAPK signaling can be down-regulated by dephosphorylation and inactivation by a family of MAPK phosphatases (MKPs). 5The abbreviations used are: MKPMAPK phosphataseKIMkinase interaction motifCDcommon dockingDSPdual specificity phosphataseCWIcell wall integritySDsynthetic dextrose. These phosphorylation/dephosphorylation events require not only a transient enzyme-substrate interaction involving the active sites of these enzymes but also the formation of a complex between the MAPK and its cognate activator, substrate, or inactivator. This is normally achieved through specific docking interactions between conserved regions within both MAPKs and MAPK-interacting proteins (3Tanoue T. Nishida E. Pharmacol. Ther. 2002; 93: 193-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Such docking sites are located outside the catalytic domains of these proteins and promote binding specificity and high affinity interactions. MAPK phosphatase kinase interaction motif common docking dual specificity phosphatase cell wall integrity synthetic dextrose. One well characterized docking motif found in MAPK-interacting proteins is the D motif, which has also been termed the δ-domain or DEJL (docking site for ERK and JNK, LXL) motif. This is closely related to the conserved kinase interaction motif (KIM) found within MAPK phosphatases and comprises a cluster of positively charged amino acids, normally lysines or arginines, followed by a submotif containing two hydrophobic residues leucine, isoleucine, or valine separated by one residue ((K/R)1–3X2–6ϕXϕ) (5Bardwell L. Shah K. Methods. 2006; 40: 213-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 6Akella R. Moon T.M. Goldsmith E.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1784: 48-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Swapping one D domain for another can completely change the specificity of protein-protein interactions, indicating that these motifs are essential to maintain binding selectivity among MAPK pathway components (7Mayor Jr., F. Jurado-Pueyo M. Campos P.M. Murga C. Cell Cycle. 2007; 6: 528-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). A second type of docking motif named the DEF motif (for docking site for ERK FXF) has been found only in some subsets of MAPK substrates. This consists of two phenylalanines separated by one amino acid and followed by proline (FXFP) (8Jacobs D. Glossip D. Xing H. Muslin A.J. Kornfeld K. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 163-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). Docking sites have been also characterized within MAPKs themselves. The region of the MAPK that interacts with D motifs is complex and is formed by the common docking (CD) domain, the ED (for Glu/Asp-containing) motif, and a hydrophobic docking groove (6Akella R. Moon T.M. Goldsmith E.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1784: 48-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The CD domain is shared by all MAPK subfamilies and is an electrostatic surface depression containing a cluster of negatively charged amino acids (aspartic and glutamic acids) located within the C-terminal domain of the kinase (9Tanoue T. Adachi M. Moriguchi T. Nishida E. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 110-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar). Substitution of these residues by charge-neutral amino acids completely abrogates docking, indicating the importance of the electrostatic interaction of the CD domain with the positively charged amino acids within the D domains of MAPK-interacting proteins (10Tanoue T. Yamamoto T. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22942-22949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The ED motif is located close to the CD domain in the tertiary structure of MAPKs and has also been reported to contribute to binding specificity (11Tanoue T. Nishida E. Cell. Signal. 2003; 15: 455-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Close to the CD/ED regions resides a hydrophobic docking groove that is involved in binding to the hydrophobic submotif of the D site of MAPK partners (10Tanoue T. Yamamoto T. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22942-22949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In contrast, the DEF motif binds to a separate hydrophobic pocket that only becomes accessible upon MAPK activation (12Lee T. Hoofnagle A.N. Kabuyama Y. Stroud J. Min X. Goldsmith E.J. Chen L. Resing K.A. Ahn N.G. Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 43-55Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). In addition, a novel interaction motif (FRIEDE) within the atypical MAPKs ERK3 and ERK4 has been shown to mediate binding to their substrate MAPKAP kinase MK5 (13Aberg E. Torgersen K.M. Johansen B. Keyse S.M. Perander M. Seternes O.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 19392-19401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Comparison of the MAPK docking interactions from yeast to humans reveals the existence of conserved molecular mechanisms underlying the specificity of these interactions (11Tanoue T. Nishida E. Cell.

Cell. 2005; 20: 951-962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Dual specificity phosphatases (DSPs) are able to dephosphorylate both threonine and tyrosine residues in their target proteins. A subfamily of these DSPs specifically targets MAPKs. These enzymes are designated as dual specificity MKPs and play an important role in the regulation of MAPK signaling. All MKPs share a common structure comprising an N-terminal non-catalytic regulatory domain, which contains the sequences necessary for MAPK docking, and a C-terminal catalytic domain (16Owens D.M. Keyse S.M. Oncogene. 2007; 26: 3203-3213Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar). Saccharomyces cerevisiae has five MAPK signaling pathways involved in mating, pseudohyphal/invasive growth, cell wall integrity (CWI), osmoregulation, and ascospore formation, mediated by Fus3, Kss1, Slt2, Hog1, and Smk1, respectively (17Chen R.E. Thorner J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1773: 1311-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). Fus3 and Kss1 are orthologous to ERK1/2, and Hog1 is orthologous to p38 (18Caffrey D.R. O'Neill L.A. Shields D.C. J. Mol. Evol. 1999; 49: 567-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The closest mammalian MAPK to Slt2 is ERK5 (19Truman A.W. Millson S.H. Nuttall J.M. King V. Mollapour M. Prodromou C. Pearl L.H. Piper P.W. Eukaryot. Cell. 2006; 5: 1914-1924Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The CWI-related protein Mlp1 is a pseudokinase paralog of Slt2 that lacks catalytic residues critical for protein kinase activity as well as the conserved Thr residue within the MAPK activation loop dual phosphorylation site. Whereas an individual MAPK can be inactivated by more than one protein phosphatase, it is also the case that a single protein phosphatase is able to interact with and inactivate several MAPKs (20Martín H. Flández M. Nombela C. Molina M. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 58: 6-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). For example, Msg5 has been shown to dephosphorylate Fus3 and Slt2, affecting both basal and inducible kinase activities (21Doi K. Gartner A. Ammerer G. Errede B. Shinkawa H. Sugimoto K. Matsumoto K. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 61-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 22Zhan X.L. Deschenes R.J. Guan K.L. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1690-1702Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 23Flández M.

Elion E.A. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2564-2576Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Msg5 is expressed in yeast cells as two isoforms that differ in the first 45 amino acids due to the use of alternative translation initiation sites (23Flández M. Cosano I.C. Nombela C. Martín H. Molina M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 11027-11034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). We have recently shown that this MKP is able to interact not only with Fus3 and Slt2 but also with Kss1, a MAPK whose phosphorylation is not down-regulated by Msg5 (25Marín M.J. Flández M. Bermejo C. Arroyo J. Martín H. Molina M. Mol. Genet. Genomics. 2009; 281: 345-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Moreover, whereas both Msg5 isoforms interact similarly with Slt2, the longer form binds both Fus3 and Kss1 with higher affinity than the shorter isoform. In a study of the docking interactions within and between the Fus3- or Kss1-mediated pathways, Reményi et al. (15Reményi A. Good M.C. Bhattacharyya R.P. Lim W.A. Mol. Cell. 2005; 20: 951-962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) found docking motifs in different proteins known to physically interact with Fus3, such as Ste7, Msg5, and Far1. Mutation of a D domain within Msg5 partially reduced the ability of this MKP to decrease the elevated mating pathway output displayed by an msg5-null mutant, indicating a contribution of the docking interaction mediated by this motif to the ability of Msg5 to inactivate Fus3. But the incomplete effect of D domain mutation also suggests that additional Fus3-docking motifs may be present in Msg5 (15Reményi A. Good M.C. Bhattacharyya R.P. Lim W.A. Mol. Cell. 2005; 20: 951-962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The interaction with Slt2 has been shown to be mediated by the N-terminal domain of Msg5 (23Flández M. Cosano I.C. Nombela C. Martín H. Molina M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 11027-11034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Here we report the characterization of the interactions between Msg5 and a number of yeast MAPKs, showing the involvement of distinct regions located at the N terminus of Msg5 in MAPK binding. D domain-dependent mechanisms participate in the binding to mating (Fus3 and Kss1) MAPKs. In contrast, a novel motif of Msg5 is involved in the interaction with the cell wall integrity (Slt2 and Mlp1) kinases. We also provide evidence indicating that, as is the case in other MAPK pathways, the CD domain of Slt2 mediates binding to its activator Mkk1, whereas a CD-proximal region containing the conserved MAPK L16 loop is involved in binding to the negative regulator Msg5 in a CD domain-independent fashion.

The MSG5 reading frame was amplified from S. cerevisiae genomic DNA; wild-type, mutant, and truncated reading frames derived from this template were subcloned as NdeI-XhoI fragments into the NdeI/SalI sites in pGBKT7: pGBKT7-Msg5, pGBKT7-Msg5(1–245), pGBKT7-Msg5(246–489), pGBKT7-Msg5(126–489), pGBKT7-Msg5(1–123), pGBKT7-Msg5(90–489), pGBKT7-Msg5(1–45), pGBKT7-Msg5(46–489), pGBKT7-Msg5MD1, pGBKT7-Msg5MD2, pGBKT7-Msg5MD1/2, pGBKT7-Msg5MD3, pGBKT7-Msg5(1–123)MD1/2, and pGBKT7-Msg5(1–123)MD3. For pGBKT7-Msg5MD1/2 and pGBKT7-Msg5(1–123)MD1/2, PCR was performed as for single point mutations but using mutant half-product templates to generate compound double and truncated mutant reading frames following the second round of amplification. YCplac22MSG5MD1, YCplac22MSG5MD2, and YCplac22MSG5MD3 plasmids were generated by site-directed mutagenesis of YCplac22MSG5m (23Flández M. Cosano I.C. Nombela C. Martín H. Molina M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 11027-11034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) following the method described previously (23Flández M. Cosano I.C. Nombela C. Martín H. Molina M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 11027-11034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). YCplac111-Slt2(1–373) was constructed by cloning a ∼3.2-kb EcoRI-EcoRI fragment containing SLT2 into YCpLac111 (CEN4, LEU2) (23Flández M. Cosano I.C. Nombela C. Martín H. Molina M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 11027-11034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and then introducing a consecutive pair of stop codons in the corresponding protein positions 374 and 375 by site-directed mutagenesis of the obtained plasmid. In order to express Msg5 fused to GST in yeast, the previously described plasmid pEG(KG)-MSG5 was used (23Flández M. Cosano I.C. Nombela C. Martín H. Molina M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 11027-11034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). pEG(KG)-Slt2(274–373) was constructed by PCR-amplifying the corresponding SLT2 region using YCplac111-Slt2(1–373) as template and then subcloning the BamHI- digested PCR product into pEG-KG (2 μm, GAL1–10UAS-CYC1). To obtain recombinant GST-Mkk1, plasmid pGEX-MKK1 was used (29Jiménez-Sánchez M. Cid V.J. Molina M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 31174-31185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Recombinant Msg5-GST, Msg5MD3-GST, and Msg5(1–123)MD3-GST were produced from plasmids constructed by subcloning PCR products featuring NdeI and XhoI sites at the 5′- and 3′-ends into a modified pGEX-P1 vector (gift of Dr. B. McStay). Recombinant Slt2, Mlp1, and Mkk1 His-tagged proteins or protein fragments were produced from pET15B-derived plasmids after cloning the corresponding PCR-amplified SLT2 and MLP1 gene fragments in NdeI and XhoI sites. Assays were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Matchmaker 3 kit, Clontech). The vector pGBKT7 or its derivatives were transformed into PJ69-4A cells and mated with PJ69-4α cells transformed with plasmid pGADT7 or its derivatives. Yeast diploids carrying both types of plasmids were selected on synthetic dextrose (SD) medium deficient for leucine and tryptophan. In order to perform a qualitative analysis of the two-hybrid interactions, representative colonies from the different diploid strains were cultivated overnight in liquid YPD, and the corresponding cellular suspensions were prepared. 10-μl volumes of inocula (normalized by optical density at 600 nm) were spotted onto two types of media: SD medium lacking leucine and tryptophan and SD medium lacking leucine, tryptophan, histidine, and adenine. Cell growth on the latter medium provides evidence for the occurrence of protein-protein interaction. For semiquantitative analysis of the two-hybrid interactions, exponentially growing diploid cells bearing the relevant plasmids were collected, and the β-galactosidase activity was determined using o-nitrophenyl-β-galactoside as a substrate, according to the manufacturer's instructions (Clontech). Recombinant GST- or histidine-tagged proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli strain Rosetta DE3 (Novagen). Cells were collected and lysed by sonication in PBS buffer containing 2 mm PMSF, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mg/ml lysozyme in the presence of protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). Extracts were clarified by centrifugation and then stored at −80 °C. For obtaining yeast extracts, the procedures employed have been described previously (27Martín H. Rodríguez-Pachón J.M. Ruiz C. Nombela C. Molina M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1511-1519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). For in vivo binding assays, yeast cells bearing pEG(KG)-derived plasmids were grown in complete synthetic medium lacking uracil with 2% galactose at 24 °C. Cells were collected and lysed as above in lysis buffer lacking SDS and Nonidet P-40. Yeast lysates were incubated with glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) for 2 h. Beads were washed extensively with the same buffer and resuspended in SDS loading buffer, and proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting as described (23Flández M. Cosano I.C. Nombela C. Martín H. Molina M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 11027-11034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In vitro binding assays were performed by mixing E. coli extracts containing GST or GST-fused proteins with E. coli extracts bearing the corresponding His-tagged proteins and then processed as above. Immunodetection of Myc- and HA- tagged proteins was carried out using either monoclonal 9E10 (Covance) or monoclonal 4A6 (Millipore) and monoclonal HA.11 (Covance) antibodies, respectively. Actin was immunodetected by using monoclonal C4 antibodies (MP Biomedicals). Polyclonal anti-phospho-p44/p42 MAPK (Thr-202/Tyr-204) (Cell Signaling), anti-GST (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), and monoclonal anti-His (Sigma) antibodies were also used as described previously (27Martín H. Rodríguez-Pachón J.M. Ruiz C. Nombela C. Molina M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1511-1519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Immunodetection of Gal4BD fusion proteins was carried out using monoclonal GAL4DNA-BD antibody (Clontech). The primary antibodies were detected using either a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody with the ECL detection system (Amersham Biosciences) or a fluorescently conjugated secondary antibody with an Odyssey Infrared Imaging System (LI-COR Biosciences). Real-time quantitative PCR assays were performed as described previously (30García R. Bermejo C. Grau C. Pérez R. Rodríguez-Peña J.M. Francois J. Nombela C. Arroyo J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15183-15195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar), using an ABI 7700 instrument (Applied Biosystems). Each cDNA was assayed in at least duplicate PCR reactions. For quantification, the abundance of each gene was determined relative to the standard transcript of ACT1, and the final data of relative gene expression between the two conditions tested were calculated following the 2−ΔΔCt method, as described (31Livak K.J. Schmittgen T.D. Methods. 2001; 25: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (127155) Google Scholar). The primer sequences are available upon request. In order to gain insight into the mechanisms that regulate the interaction of Msg5 with its substrate MAPKs, we first wanted to define the MAPKs that physically interact with this phosphatase. To this end, the yeast two-hybrid assay was used. Msg5 was fused to the Gal4-DNA binding domain (Gal4BD), and the five MAPKs (Kss1, Fus3, Smk1, Slt2, and Hog1) as well as the pseudokinase Slt2 paralog Mlp1 (32Kim K.Y. Truman A.W. Levin D.E. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 28: 2579-2589Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) were fused to the Gal4 activation domain (Gal4AD). Expression of all of these hybrid proteins was analyzed by Western blotting (supplemental Fig. S1). Formation of a complex between Msg5 and the corresponding MAPK results in reconstitution of the Gal4 transcription factor and expression of the Gal4-dependent reporter genes HIS3, ADE2, and lacZ. These interactions can then be monitored by either growth of the diploid strains on selective medium lacking adenine and histidine or semiquantitative assays of β-galactosidase activity. As shown in Fig. 1A, only the yeast cells expressing Msg5 together with Kss1, Fus3, Slt2, or Mlp1 were able to grow on selective medium lacking adenine and histidine. In addition, expression of lacZ was only observed in these same cells (Fig. 1B). The strongest interaction with Msg5, in terms of increased β-galactosidase activity, was observed with Mlp1. Interactions with Slt2 and Kss1 were also significant, whereas the lowest strength interaction was observed with Fus3. Western blotting analysis revealed that this was not due to low level expression of Gal4AD-Fus3 (supplemental Fig. S1). Despite being expressed to a similar extent as the other kinases (supplemental Fig. S1), neither Hog1 nor Smk1 was able to interact with Msg5 in the two-hybrid assay (Figs. 1, A and B). A catalytically inactive mutant of Msg5C319S (21Doi K. Gartner A. Ammerer G. Errede B. Shinkawa H. Sugimoto K. Matsumoto K. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 61-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) also failed to interact with either Hog1 or Smk1 (data not shown), ruling out the possibility that the absence of binding was due to dephosphorylation of these kinases by Msg5. Msg5 is composed of an N-terminal domain (approximately residues 1–245) and a C-terminal catalytic domain (approximately residues 246–489). To determine the involvement of these two regions in interactions with distinct MAPKs, we extended our two-hybrid analysis by using constructs containing either the isolated N-terminal or C-terminal domains of Msg5. As observed in Fig. 1C, the N-terminal domain of Msg5 interacted with all four of the MAPKs that bind full-length Msg5. Although the β-galactosidase levels were significantly reduced when compared with those measured between full-length Msg5 and these MAPKs, the strongest interaction was again observed with Mlp1 (Fig. 1D). The C-terminal domain of Msg5 fused to Gal4BD did not show interaction with any of the MAPKs (Fig. 1D), although it was highly expressed (supplemental Fig. S1). These results indicate that the N-terminal domain of Msg5 is both necessary and sufficient to mediate protein-protein interactions with MAPK substrates. In order to further elucidate the region of Msg5 that is responsible for the interactions with Fus3, Kss1, Slt2, and Mlp1, we next tested a set of Msg5 truncations fused to Gal4BD for binding to the distinct Gal4AD-MAPK fusions. The expression of these hybrid Msg5 proteins was also monitored by Western blotting (supplemental Fig. S1). As shown in Fig. 2, A and B, the region encompassing the first 123 amino acids of Msg5 (Msg5(1–123)) is necessary and sufficient for the interaction with all four MAPKs. In contrast, although highly expressed (supplemental Fig. S1), a construct lacking the first 123 residues (Msg5(124–489)) failed to interact with all four MAPKs. However, although an Msg5 construct lacking the first 45 amino acids interacted with both Slt2 and Mlp1, it could no longer bind to either Fus3 or Kss1 (Fig. 2, A and C). Consistent with these data, an Msg5 fragment containing only the first 45 amino acids interacted with Fus3 and Kss1 but not with Mlp1 and Slt2 (Fig. 2, A and B). These two-hybrid results are also in agreement with our previously reported data showing that the short Msg5 isoform, which lacks the first 45 amino acids, displays a much lower affinity for Fus3 and Kss1 than the full-length Msg5 isoform in co-purification assays, whereas both isoforms bind Slt2 with the same affinity (25Marín M.J. Flández M. Bermejo C. Arroyo J. Martín H. Molina M. Mol. Genet. Genomics. 2009; 281: 345-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Finally, a mutant of Msg5 lacking the first 89 amino acids did not interact with Fus3 and Kss1 but was still able to interact with Slt2 and Mlp1 (Fig. 2, A and C). In summary, these two-hybrid data show that different regions of Msg5 me"
https://openalex.org/W2069062661,"Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) are frequently mediated by the binding of a modular domain in one protein to a short, linear peptide motif in its partner. The advent of proteomic methods such as peptide and protein arrays has led to the accumulation of a wealth of interaction data for modular interaction domains. Although several computational programs have been developed to predict modular domain-mediated PPI events, they are often restricted to a given domain type. We describe DomPep, a method that can potentially be used to predict PPIs mediated by any modular domains. DomPep combines proteomic data with sequence information to achieve high accuracy and high coverage in PPI prediction. Proteomic binding data were employed to determine a simple yet novel parameter Ligand-Binding Similarity which, in turn, is used to calibrate Domain Sequence Identity and Position-Weighted-Matrix distance, two parameters that are used in constructing prediction models. Moreover, DomPep can be used to predict PPIs for both domains with experimental binding data and those without. Using the PDZ and SH2 domain families as test cases, we show that DomPep can predict PPIs with accuracies superior to existing methods. To evaluate DomPep as a discovery tool, we deployed DomPep to identify interactions mediated by three human PDZ domains. Subsequent in-solution binding assays validated the high accuracy of DomPep in predicting authentic PPIs at the proteome scale. Because DomPep makes use of only interaction data and the primary sequence of a domain, it can be readily expanded to include other types of modular domains."

A sample of 55 TMD patients were selected. Each was examined with standard clinical procedures and genotyping techniques.The major histological finding in ank mutant mice was joint space narrowing. Within TMD patients, closed lock was more prevalent among ANKH-OR homozygotes (p = 0.011, OR = 7.7, 95% CI 1.6-36.5) and the elder (p = 0.005, OR = 2.4, 95% CI 1.3-4.3).Fibrous ankylosis was identified in the TMJ of ank mutant mice. In the human sample, ANKH-OR polymorphism was found to be a genetic marker associated with TMJ closed lock. Future investigations correlating genetic polymorphism to TMD are indicated."
https://openalex.org/W1965982190,"Aim To investigate the factors predicting adolescent visits to practitioners of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM). Methods A longitudinal cohort study conducted in an adolescent total population in Central Norway (The Nord-Trøndelag Health Studies (HUNT)). In Young-HUNT 1, all inhabitants aged 13 to 19 years (N = 8944, 89% response rate) were invited to participate, and the youngest group (13 to 15 year olds) was surveyed again 4 years later (Young-HUNT 2, N = 2429, 82% response rate). The participants completed a comprehensive questionnaire on health and life style which included a question regarding visits to a CAM practitioner in the last 12 months. Results One in eleven (8.7%, 95%CI 7.6-9.8%) had visited a CAM practitioner, an increase of 26% in 4 years (1.8% points). The final multivariable analysis predicted increased odds of an adolescent becoming a CAM visitor four years later (p<0.05) if she or he had previously visited a CAM practitioner (adjOR 3.4), had musculoskeletal pain (adjOR 1.5), had migraine (adjOR 2.3), used asthma medicines (adjOR 1.8) or suffered from another disease lasting more than three months (adjOR 2.1). Being male predicted reduced odds of visiting a CAM practitioner in the future (adjOR 0.6). Conclusion We can conclude from this study that future visits to a CAM practitioner are predicted by both predisposing factors (being female, having visited a CAM practitioner previously) and medical need factors (having had musculoskeletal pain, migraine, used asthma medicines or experienced another disease lasting more than three months). None of the specific variables associated with CAM visits were predictive for CAM visits four years later."
https://openalex.org/W2033267454,"Background We previously showed that equivalence between two identified zebrafish motoneurons is broken by interactions with identified muscle fibers that act as an intermediate target for the axons of these motoneurons. Here we investigate the molecular basis of the signaling interaction between the intermediate target and the motoneurons. Principal Findings We provide evidence that Netrin 1a is an intermediate target-derived signal that causes two equivalent motoneurons to adopt distinct fates. We show that although these two motoneurons express the same Netrin receptors, their axons respond differently to Netrin 1a encountered at the intermediate target. Furthermore, we demonstrate that when Netrin 1a is knocked down, more distal intermediate targets that express other Netrins can also function to break equivalence between these motoneurons. Significance Our results suggest a new role for intermediate targets in breaking neuronal equivalence. The data we present reveal that signals encountered during axon pathfinding can cause equivalent neurons to adopt distinct fates. Such signals may be key in diversifying a neuronal population and leading to correct circuit formation."
https://openalex.org/W1974976172,"To explore gene therapy strategies for amelogenesis imperfecta (AI), a human ameloblast-like cell population was established from third molars of an AI-affected patient. These cells were characterized by expression of cytokeratin 14, major enamel proteins and alkaline phosphatase staining. Suboptimal transduction of the ameloblast-like cells by an adenovirus type 5 (Ad5) vector was consistent with lower levels of the coxsackie-and-adenovirus receptor (CAR) on those cells relative to CAR-positive A549 cells. To overcome CAR -deficiency, we evaluated capsid-modified Ad5 vectors with various genetic capsid modifications including “pK7” and/or “RGD” motif-containing short peptides incorporated in the capsid protein fiber as well as fiber chimera with the Ad serotype 3 (Ad3) fiber “knob” domain. All fiber modifications provided an augmented transduction of AI-ameloblasts, revealed following vector dose normalization in A549 cells with a superior effect (up to 404-fold) of pK7/RGD double modification. This robust infectivity enhancement occurred through vector binding to both αvβ3/αvβ5 integrins and heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) highly expressed by AI-ameloblasts as revealed by gene transfer blocking experiments. This work thus not only pioneers establishment of human AI ameloblast-like cell population as a model for in vitro studies but also reveals an optimal infectivity-enhancement strategy for a potential Ad5 vector-mediated gene therapy for AI."
https://openalex.org/W2009846696,"Aim 15-Deoxy-Δ12,14 Prostaglandin J2 (15d-PGJ2) is a ligand of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) having diverse effects such as the differentiation of adipocytes and atherosclerotic lesion formation. 15d-PGJ2 can also regulate the expression of inflammatory mediators on immune cells independent of PPARγ. We investigated the antiatherogenic effect of 15d-PGJ2. Methods We fed apolipoprotein (apo) E-deficient female mice a Western-type diet from 8 to 16 wk of age and administered 1 mg/kg/day 15d-PGJ2 intraperitoneally. We measured atherosclerotic lesions at the aortic root, and examined the expression of macrophage and inflammatory atherosclerotic molecules by immunohistochemical and real-time PCR in the lesion. Results Atherosclerotic lesion formation was reduced in apo E-null mice treated with 15d-PGJ2, as compared to in the controls. Immunohistochemical and real-time PCR analyses showed that the expression of MCP-1, TNF-α, and MMP-9 in atherosclerotic lesions was significantly decreased in 15d-PGJ2 treated mice. The 15d-PGJ2 also reduced the expression of macrophages and RelA mRNA in atherosclerotic lesions. Conclusion This is the first report 15d-PGJ2, a natural PPARγ agonist, can improve atherosclerotic lesions in vivo. 15d-PGJ2 may be a beneficial therapeutic agent for atherosclerosis."
https://openalex.org/W2015641309,"Background Transplantation of mononuclear cells (MNCs) has previously been tested as a method to induce therapeutic angiogenesis to treat limb ischemia in clinical trials. Non-invasive high resolution imaging is required to track the cells and evaluate clinical relevance after cell transplantation. The hypothesis that MRI can provide in vivo detection and long-term observation of MNCs labeled with manganese contrast-agent was investigated in ischemic rat legs. Methods and Findings The Mn-labeled MNCs were evaluated using 7-tesla high-field magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Intramuscular transplanted Mn-labeled MNCs were visualized with MRI for at least 7 and up to 21 days after transplantation in the ischemic leg. The distribution of Mn-labeled MNCs was similar to that of 111In-labeled MNCs measured with single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and DiI-dyed MNCs with fluorescence microscopy. In addition, at 1–2 days after transplantation the volume of the site injected with intact Mn-labeled MNCs was significantly larger than that injected with dead MNCs, although the dead Mn-labeled MNCs were also found for approximately 2 weeks in the ischemic legs. The area covered by CD31-positive cells (as a marker of capillary endothelial cells) in the intact Mn-MNCs implanted site at 43 days was significantly larger than that at a site implanted with dead Mn-MNCs. Conclusions The present Mn-enhanced MRI method enabled visualization of the transplanted area with a 150–175 µm in-plane spatial resolution and allowed the migration of labeled-MNCs to be observed for long periods in the same subject. After further optimization, MRI-based Mn-enhanced cell-tracking could be a useful technique for evaluation of cell therapy both in research and clinical applications."
https://openalex.org/W2146763761,"The type IV secretion system (T4SS) encoded within the gonococcal genetic island (GGI) of Neisseria gonorrhoeae has homology to the T4SS encoded on the F plasmid. The GGI encodes the putative pilin protein TraA and a serine protease TrbI, which is homologous to the TraF protein of the RP4 plasmid involved in circularization of pilin subunits of P-type pili. TraA was processed to a 68-amino acid long circular peptide by leader peptidase and TrbI. Processing occurred after co-translational membrane insertion and was independent of other proteins. Circularization occurred after removal of three C-terminal amino acids. Mutational analysis of TraA revealed limited flexibility at the cleavage and joining sites. Mutagenesis of TrbI showed that the conserved Lys-93 and Asp-155 are essential, whereas mutagenesis of Ser-52, the putative catalytic serine did not influence circularization. Further mutagenesis of other serine residues did not identify a catalytic serine, indicating that TrbI either contains redundant catalytic serine residues or does not function via a serine-lysine dyad mechanism. In vitro studies revealed that circularization occurs via a covalent intermediate between the C terminus of TraA and TrbI. The intermediate is processed to the circular form after cleavage of the N-terminal signal sequence. This is the first demonstration of a covalent intermediate in the circularization mechanism of conjugative pili."
