https://openalex.org/W4225982774,"Recent surveillance has revealed the emergence of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant (BA.1/B.1.1.529) harboring up to 36 mutations in spike protein, the target of neutralizing antibodies. Given its potential to escape vaccine-induced humoral immunity, we measured the neutralization potency of sera from 88 mRNA-1273, 111 BNT162b, and 40 Ad26.COV2.S vaccine recipients against wild-type, Delta, and Omicron SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviruses. We included individuals that received their primary series recently (<3 months), distantly (6-12 months), or an additional ""booster"" dose, while accounting for prior SARS-CoV-2 infection. Remarkably, neutralization of Omicron was undetectable in most vaccinees. However, individuals boosted with mRNA vaccines exhibited potent neutralization of Omicron, only 4-6-fold lower than wild type, suggesting enhanced cross-reactivity of neutralizing antibody responses. In addition, we find that Omicron pseudovirus infects more efficiently than other variants tested. Overall, this study highlights the importance of additional mRNA doses to broaden neutralizing antibody responses against highly divergent SARS-CoV-2 variants."

The most successful examples are the CFTR correctors, which transformed cystic fibrosis therapy. These molecules revert folding defects of the ΔF508 mutant and are widely used to treat patients. To investigate the molecular mechanism of their action, we determined cryo-electron microscopy structures of CFTR in complex with the FDA-approved correctors lumacaftor or tezacaftor. Both drugs insert into a hydrophobic pocket in the first transmembrane domain (TMD1), linking together four helices that are thermodynamically unstable. Mutating residues at the binding site rendered ΔF508-CFTR insensitive to lumacaftor and tezacaftor, underscoring the functional significance of the structural discovery. These results support a mechanism in which the correctors stabilize TMD1 at an early stage of biogenesis, prevent its premature degradation, and thereby allosterically rescuing many disease-causing mutations."
https://openalex.org/W4205292565,"Hyperactive and damaging inflammation is a hallmark of severe rather than mild Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). To uncover key inflammatory differentiators between severe and mild COVID-19, we applied an unbiased single-cell transcriptomic analysis. We integrated two single-cell RNA-seq datasets with COVID-19 patient samples, one that sequenced bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cells and one that sequenced peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). The combined cell population was then analyzed with a focus on genes associated with disease severity. The immunomodulatory long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) NEAT1 and MALAT1 were highly differentially expressed between mild and severe patients in multiple cell types. Within those same cell types, the concurrent detection of other severity-associated genes involved in cellular stress response and apoptosis regulation suggests that the pro-inflammatory functions of these lncRNAs may foster cell stress and damage. Thus, NEAT1 and MALAT1 are potential components of immune dysregulation in COVID-19 that may provide targets for severity related diagnostic measures or therapy."

https://openalex.org/W4205519160,"Down syndrome (DS) is a genetic disorder driven by the triplication of chromosome 21 (T21) and characterized by a wide range of neurodevelopmental and physical disabilities. Transcriptomic analysis of tissue samples from individuals with DS has revealed that T21 induces a genome-wide transcriptional disruption. However, the consequences of T21 on the nuclear architecture and its interplay with the transcriptome remain unknown. In this study, we find that unlike human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), iPSC-derived neural progenitor cells (NPCs) exhibit genome-wide “chromosomal introversion,” disruption of lamina-associated domains, and global chromatin accessibility changes in response to T21, consistent with the transcriptional and nuclear architecture changes characteristic of senescent cells. Treatment of T21-harboring NPCs with senolytic drugs alleviates the transcriptional, molecular, and cellular dysfunctions associated with DS. Our findings provide a mechanistic link between T21 and global transcriptional disruption and indicate that senescence-associated phenotypes may play a key role in the neurodevelopmental pathogenesis of DS."
https://openalex.org/W4206995009,"Fingerprints are of long-standing practical and cultural interest, but little is known about the mechanisms that underlie their variation. Using genome-wide scans in Han Chinese cohorts, we identified 18 loci associated with fingerprint type across the digits, including a genetic basis for the long-recognized ""pattern-block"" correlations among the middle three digits. In particular, we identified a variant near EVI1 that alters regulatory activity and established a role for EVI1 in dermatoglyph patterning in mice. Dynamic EVI1 expression during human development supports its role in shaping the limbs and digits, rather than influencing skin patterning directly. Trans-ethnic meta-analysis identified 43 fingerprint-associated loci, with nearby genes being strongly enriched for general limb development pathways. We also found that fingerprint patterns were genetically correlated with hand proportions. Taken together, these findings support the key role of limb development genes in influencing the outcome of fingerprint patterning."
https://openalex.org/W4206155527,"Contrary to multicellular organisms that display segmentation during development, communities of unicellular organisms are believed to be devoid of such sophisticated patterning. Unexpectedly, we find that the gene expression underlying the nitrogen stress response of a developing Bacillus subtilis biofilm becomes organized into a ring-like pattern. Mathematical modeling and genetic probing of the underlying circuit indicate that this patterning is generated by a clock and wavefront mechanism, similar to that driving vertebrate somitogenesis. We experimentally validated this hypothesis by showing that predicted nutrient conditions can even lead to multiple concentric rings, resembling segments. We additionally confirmed that this patterning mechanism is driven by cell-autonomous oscillations. Importantly, we show that the clock and wavefront process also spatially patterns sporulation within the biofilm. Together, these findings reveal a biofilm segmentation clock that organizes cellular differentiation in space and time, thereby challenging the paradigm that such patterning mechanisms are exclusive to plant and animal development."
https://openalex.org/W4206337645,"There is an urgent need to improve the understanding of neuroinflammation in Alzheimer's disease (AD). We analyzed cerebrospinal fluid inflammatory biomarker correlations to brain structural volume and longitudinal cognitive outcomes in the DELCODE study and in a validation cohort of the F.ACE Alzheimer Center Barcelona. We investigated whether respective biomarker changes are evident before onset of cognitive impairment. YKL-40; sTREM2; sAXL; sTyro3; MIF; complement factors C1q, C4, and H; ferritin; and ApoE protein were elevated in pre-dementia subjects with pathological levels of tau or other neurodegeneration markers, demonstrating tight interactions between inflammation and accumulating neurodegeneration even before onset of symptoms. Intriguingly, higher levels of ApoE and soluble TAM receptors sAXL and sTyro3 were related to larger brain structure and stable cognitive outcome at follow-up. Our findings indicate a protective mechanism relevant for intervention strategies aiming to regulate neuroinflammation in subjects with no or subjective symptoms but underlying AD pathology profile."
https://openalex.org/W4207052860,"Metabolic alterations regulate cancer aggressiveness and immune responses. Given the poor response of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) to conventional immunotherapies, we investigated the link between metabolic alterations and immunosuppression. Our metabolic enzyme screen indicated that elevated expression of CD73, an ecto-5'-nucleotidase that generates adenosine, correlates with increased aggressiveness. Correspondingly, we observed increased interstitial adenosine levels in tumors from spontaneous PDAC mouse models. Diminishing CD73 by genetic manipulations ablated in vivo tumor growth, and decreased myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) in orthotopic mouse models of PDAC. A high-throughput cytokine profiling demonstrated decreased GM-CSF in mice implanted with CD73 knockdowns. Furthermore, we noted increased IFN-γ expression by intratumoral CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in pancreatic tumors with CD73 knockdowns. Depletion of CD4+ T cells, but not CD8+ T cells abrogated the beneficial effects of decreased CD73. We also observed that splenic MDSCs from Nt5e knockdown tumor-bearing mice were incompetent in suppressing T cell activation in the ex vivo assays. Replenishing GM-CSF restored tumor growth in Nt5e knockout tumors, which was reverted by MDSC depletion. Finally, anti-CD73 antibody treatment significantly improved gemcitabine efficacy in orthotopic models. Thus, targeting the adenosine axis presents a novel therapeutic opportunity for improving the anti-tumoral immune response against PDAC."
https://openalex.org/W4205835860,"Currently, a significant amount of research is focused on detecting Marine Debris and assessing its spectral behaviour via remote sensing, ultimately aiming at new operational monitoring solutions. Here, we introduce a Marine Debris Archive (MARIDA), as a benchmark dataset for developing and evaluating Machine Learning (ML) algorithms capable of detecting Marine Debris. MARIDA is the first dataset based on the multispectral Sentinel-2 (S2) satellite data, which distinguishes Marine Debris from various marine features that co-exist, including Sargassum macroalgae , Ships , Natural Organic Material , Waves , Wakes , Foam , dissimilar water types (i.e., Clear , Turbid Water , Sediment-Laden Water , Shallow Water ), and Clouds . We provide annotations (georeferenced polygons/ pixels) from verified plastic debris events in several geographical regions globally, during different seasons, years and sea state conditions. A detailed spectral and statistical analysis of the MARIDA dataset is presented along with well-established ML baselines for weakly supervised semantic segmentation and multi-label classification tasks. MARIDA is an open-access dataset which enables the research community to explore the spectral behaviour of certain floating materials, sea state features and water types, to develop and evaluate Marine Debris detection solutions based on artificial intelligence and deep learning architectures, as well as satellite pre-processing pipelines."
https://openalex.org/W4205972784,"Background Timely initiation of antenatal care (ANC) is an important component of ANC services that improve the health of the mother and the newborn. Mothers who begin attending ANC in a timely manner, can fully benefit from preventive and curative services. However, evidence in sub-Saharan Africa (sSA) indicated that the majority of pregnant mothers did not start their first visit timely. As our search concerned, there is no study that incorporates a large number of sub-Saharan Africa countries. Thus, the objective of this study was to assess the prevalence of timely initiation of ANC and its associated factors in 36 sSA countries. Methods The Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) of 36 sSA countries were used for the analysis. The total weighted sample of 233,349 women aged 15–49 years who gave birth in the five years preceding the survey and who had ANC visit for their last child were included. A multi-level logistic regression model was used to examine the individual and community-level factors that influence the timely initiation of ANC. Results were presented using adjusted odds ratio (AOR) with 95% confidence interval (CI). Results In this study, overall timely initiation of ANC visit was 38.0% (95% CI: 37.8–38.2), ranging from 14.5% in Mozambique to 68.6% in Liberia. In the final multilevel logistic regression model:- women with secondary education (AOR = 1.08; 95% CI: 1.06, 1.11), higher education (AOR = 1.43; 95% CI: 1.36, 1.51), women aged 25–34 years (AOR = 1.20; 95% CI: 1.17, 1.23), ≥35 years (AOR = 1.30; 95% CI: 1.26, 1.35), women from richest household (AOR = 1.19; 95% CI: 1.14, 1.22), women perceiving distance from the health facility as not a big problem (AOR = 1.05; 95%CI: 1.03, 1.07), women exposed to media (AOR = 1.29; 95%CI: 1.26, 1.32), women living in communities with medium percentage of literacy (AOR = 1.51; 95%CI: 1.40, 1.63), and women living in communities with high percentage of literacy (AOR = 1.56; 95%CI: 1.38, 1.76) were more likely to initiate ANC timely. However, women who wanted their pregnancy later (AOR = 0.84; 95%CI: 0.82, 0.86), wanted no more pregnancy (AOR = 0.80; 95%CI: 0.77, 0.83), and women residing in the rural area (AOR = 0.90; 95%CI: 0.87, 0.92) were less likely to initiate ANC timely. Conclusion Even though the WHO recommends all women initiate ANC within 12 weeks of gestation, sSA recorded a low overall prevalence of timely initiation of ANC. Maternal education, pregnancy intention, residence, age, wealth status, media exposure, distance from health facility, and community-level literacy were significantly associated with timely initiation of ANC. Therefore, intervention efforts should focus on the identified factors in order to improve timely initiation of ANC in sSA. This can be done through the providing information and education to the community on the timing and importance of attending antenatal care and family planning to prevent unwanted pregnancy, especially in rural settings."
https://openalex.org/W4205816095,"Human speech can be divided into short, rhythmically timed elements, similar to syllables within words. Even our cries and laughs, as well as the vocalizations of other species, are periodic. However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the tempo of mammalian vocalizations remain unknown. Furthermore, even the core cells that produce vocalizations remain ill-defined. Here, we describe rhythmically timed neonatal mouse vocalizations that occur within single breaths and identify a brainstem node that is necessary for and sufficient to structure these cries, which we name the intermediate reticular oscillator (iRO). We show that the iRO acts autonomously and sends direct inputs to key muscles and the respiratory rhythm generator in order to coordinate neonatal vocalizations with breathing, as well as paces and patterns these cries. These results reveal that a novel mammalian brainstem oscillator embedded within the conserved breathing circuitry plays a central role in the production of neonatal vocalizations."
https://openalex.org/W4205110751,"Lignocellulosic biomass such as barley straw is a renewable and sustainable alternative to traditional feeds and could be used as bioenergy sources; however, low hydrolysis rate reduces the fermentation efficiency. Understanding the degradation and colonization of barley straw by rumen bacteria is the key step to improve the utilization of barley straw in animal feeding or biofuel production. This study evaluated the hydrolysis of barley straw as a result of the inoculation by rumen fluid of camel and sheep. Ground barley straw was incubated anaerobically with rumen inocula from three fistulated camels (FC) and three fistulated sheep (FR) for a period of 72 h. The source of rumen inoculum did not affect the disappearance of dry matter (DMD), neutral detergent fiber (NDFD). Group FR showed higher production of glucose, xylose, and gas; while higher ethanol production was associated with cellulosic hydrolysates obtained from FC group. The diversity and structure of bacterial communities attached to barley straw was investigated by Illumina Mi-Seq sequencing of V4-V5 region of 16S rRNA genes. The bacterial community was dominated by phylum Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes. The dominant genera were RC9_gut_group, Ruminococcus, Saccharofermentans, Butyrivibrio, Succiniclasticum, Selenomonas, and Streptococcus, indicating the important role of these genera in lignocellulose fermentation in the rumen. Group FR showed higher RC9_gut_group and group FC revealed higher Ruminococcus, Saccharofermentans, and Butyrivibrio. Higher enzymes activities (cellulase and xylanase) were associated with group FC. Thus, bacterial communities in camel and sheep have a great potential to improve the utilization lignocellulosic material in animal feeding and the production of biofuel and enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W4206214704,"Cancer metabolic reprogramming enhances its malignant behaviors and drug resistance, which is regulated by POU domain transcription factors. This study explored the effect of POU domain class 2 transcription factor 1 (POU2F1) on metabolic reprogramming in colon cancer. The POU2F1 expression was analyzed in GEO dataset, TCGA cohorts and human colon cancer tissues by bioinformatics and immunohistochemistry. The effects of altered POU2F1 expression on proliferation, glucose metabolism and oxaliplatin sensitivity of colon cancer cells were tested. The impacts of POU2F1 on aldolase A (ALDOA) expression and malignant behaviors of colon cancer cells were examined. We found that up-regulated POU2F1 expression was associated with worse prognosis and oxaliplatin resistance in colon cancer. POU2F1 enhanced the proliferation, aerobic glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) activity, but reduced oxidative stress and apoptosis in colon cancer cells, dependent on up-regulating ALDOA expression. Mechanistically, POU2F1 directly bound to the ALDOA promoter to enhance the ALDOA promoter activity in colon cancer cells. Moreover, activation of the POU2F1-ALDOA axis decreased the sensitivity to oxaliplatin in colon cancer cells. These data indicate that the POU2F1-ALDOA axis promotes the progression and oxaliplatin resistance by enhancing metabolic reprogramming in colon cancer. Our findings suggest that the POU2F1-ALDOA axis may be new therapeutic targets to overcome oxaliplatin resistance in colon cancer."

Little is known about the role cognitive appraisals, information management, and upregulating pleasant emotions can play to support emotion regulation in a pandemic. In an online survey (N = 1682), we investigated predictors of changes in pleasant and unpleasant emotions in a German sample (aged 18-88 years) shortly after the first restrictions were imposed. Crisis self-efficacy and felt restriction were predictors of changes in unpleasant emotions and joy alike. The application of emotion up-regulation strategies was weakly associated with changes in joy. Among the different upregulation strategies, only ""savouring the moment"" predicted changes in joy. Our study informs future research perspectives assessing the role of upregulating pleasant emotions under challenging circumstances."
https://openalex.org/W4205916163,"Appropriate fibrotic tissue formation after myocardial infarction (MI) is crucial to the maintenance of the heart's structure. M2-like macrophages play a vital role in post-MI fibrosis by activating cardiac fibroblasts. Because the mechanism by which post-MI cardiac fibrosis is regulated is not fully understood, we investigated, in vitro and in vivo, the cellular and molecular mechanisms of post-MI fibrotic tissue formation, especially those related to the regulation of cellular senescence and apoptosis. CD206+ F4/80+ CD11b+ M2-like macrophages collected from mouse hearts on post-MI day 7 showed increased expression of neuregulin 1 (Nrg1). Nrg1 receptor epidermal growth factor receptors ErbB2 and ErbB4 were expressed on cardiac fibroblasts in the infarct area. M2-like macrophage-derived Nrg1 suppressed both hydrogen peroxide-induced senescence and apoptosis of fibroblasts, whereas blockade of ErbB function significantly accelerated both processes. M2-like macrophage-derived Nrg1/ErbB/PI3K/Akt signaling, shown to be related to anti-senescence, was activated in damaged cardiac fibroblasts. Interestingly, systemic blockade of ErbB function in MI model mice enhanced senescence and apoptosis of cardiac fibroblasts and exacerbated inflammation. Further, increased accumulation of M2-like macrophages resulted in excessive post-MI progression of fibrosis in mice hearts. The molecular mechanism underlying the regulation of fibrotic tissue formation in the infarcted myocardium was shown in part to be attenuation of apoptosis and senescence of cardiac fibroblasts by the activation of Nrg1/ErbB/PI3K/Akt signaling. M2-like macrophage-mediated regulation of Nrg1/ErbB signaling has a substantial effect on fibrotic tissue formation in the infarcted adult mouse heart and is critical for suppressing the progression of senescence and apoptosis of cardiac fibroblasts."
https://openalex.org/W4206917311,"Nonsense mutations, which occur in ∼11% of patients with genetic disorders, introduce premature termination codons (PTCs) that lead to truncated proteins and promote nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. Aminoglycosides such as G418 permit PTC readthrough and so may be used to address this problem. However, their effects are variable between patients, making clinical use of aminoglycosides challenging. In this study, we tested whether TRPC nonselective cation channels contribute to the variable PTC readthrough effect of aminoglycosides by controlling their cellular uptake. Indeed, a recently reported selective TRPC5 inhibitor, AC1903, consistently suppressed G418 uptake and G418-induced PTC readthrough in the DMS-114 cancer cell line and junctional epidermolysis bullosa (JEB) patient-derived keratinocytes. Interestingly, the effect of AC1903 in DMS-114 cells was mimicked by nonselective TRPC inhibitors, but not by well-characterized inhibitors of TRPC1/4/5 (Pico145, GFB-8438) or TRPC3/6/7 (SAR7334), suggesting that AC1903 may work through additional or undefined targets. Indeed, in our experiments, AC1903 inhibited multiple TRPC channels including TRPC3, TRPC4, TRPC5, TRPC6, TRPC4-C1, and TRPC5-C1, as well as endogenous TRPC1:C4 channels in A498 renal cancer cells, all with low micromolar IC50 values (1.8-18 μM). We also show that AC1903 inhibited TRPV4 channels, but had weak or no effects on TRPV1 and no effect on the nonselective cation channel PIEZO1. Our study reveals that AC1903 has previously unrecognized targets, which need to be considered when interpreting results from experiments with this compound. In addition, our data strengthen the hypothesis that nonselective calcium channels are involved in aminoglycoside uptake."
https://openalex.org/W4205256760,"The cytidine deaminase APOBEC3B (A3B) is an endogenous inducer of somatic mutations and causes chromosomal instability by converting cytosine to uracil in single-stranded DNA. Therefore, identification of factors and mechanisms that mediate A3B expression will be helpful for developing therapeutic approaches to decrease DNA mutagenesis. Arsenic (As) is one well-known mutagen and carcinogen, but the mechanisms by which it induces mutations have not been fully elucidated. Herein, we show that A3B is upregulated and required for As-induced DNA damage and mutagenesis. We found that As treatment causes a decrease of N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification near the stop codon of A3B, consequently increasing the stability of A3B mRNA. We further reveal that the demethylase FTO is responsible for As-reduced m6A modification of A3B, leading to increased A3B expression and DNA mutation rates in a manner dependent on the m6A reader YTHDF2. Our in vivo data also confirm that A3B is a downstream target of FTO in As-exposed lung tissues. In addition, FTO protein is highly expressed and positively correlates with the protein levels of A3B in tumor samples from human non-small cell lung cancer patients. These findings indicate a previously unrecognized role of A3B in As-triggered somatic mutation and might open new avenues to reduce DNA mutagenesis by targeting the FTO/m6A axis."
https://openalex.org/W4205766790,"T-acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is an aggressive hematological malignancy that comprises the accumulation of malignant T-cells. Despite current therapies, failure to conventional treatments and relapse are frequent in children with T-ALL. It is known that the chemokine CXCL12 modulates leukemia survival and dissemination; however, our understanding of molecular mechanisms used by T-ALL cells to infiltrate and respond to leukemia cells-microenvironment interactions is still vague. In the present study, we showed that CXCL12 promoted H3K9 methylation in cell lines and primary T-ALL cells within minutes. We thus identified that CXCL12-mediated H3K9 methylation affected the global chromatin configuration and the nuclear mechanics of T-ALL cells. Importantly, we characterized changes in the genomic profile of T-ALL cells associated with rapid CXCL12 stimulation. We showed that blocking CXCR4 and protein kinase C (PKC) impaired the H3K9 methylation induced by CXCL12 in T-ALL cells. Finally, blocking H3K9 methyltransferases reduced the efficiency of T-ALL cells to deform their nuclei, migrate across confined spaces, and home to spleen and bone marrow in vivo models. Together, our data show novel functions for CXL12 as a master regulator of nuclear deformability and epigenetic changes in T-ALL cells, and its potential as a promising pharmacological target against T-ALL dissemination."

We use the latent class stochastic frontier model and create classes based on three separating variables, representing farms’ environmental sustainability and social sustainability. The application to a sample of Spanish crop farms shows that more environmentally sustainable farms are likely to have lower levels of technical efficiency. However, improvements in social concerns, both towards own farm and the larger community, may lead to improved technical efficiency levels. In general, our study provides evidence of trade-offs for farms between economic sustainability and environmental sustainability, but also between environmental sustainability and social sustainability."
https://openalex.org/W4206552589,"Apart from improving husbandry conditions and animal welfare, there is a clear public demand to increase transparency in agricultural activities. Personal farm tours have shown to be appreciated by citizens but are limited in their impact because of hygiene requirements and accessibility. Virtual farm tours are a promising approach to overcome these limitations but evidence on their perceptions is missing. This study analyzes how a virtual farm tour is perceived by showing participants (n = 17) a 360-degree video of a conventional pig fattening pen on a tablet and via virtual reality (VR) glasses. Semi-structured in-depth interviews were conducted to analyze perceptions and level of immersion and to elicit differences between media devices. Participants' perception of the pig fattening pen was rather poor and depended on the recording perspective as well as on the media device. However, housing conditions were perceived more positively compared to the image participants had in mind prior to the study, and thus the stable was considered as a rather positive example. Participants described virtual farm tours as suitable tool to improve transparency and information transfer and to gain insights into husbandry conditions. They appreciated the comfortable and entertaining character of both media devices and named various possibilities for implementation. However, VR glasses were favored regarding the higher realistic and entertaining value, while the tablet was considered beneficial in terms of usability. The presentation of video sequences without additional explanations about the farm or the housing conditions were claimed insufficient to give an adequate understanding of the seen content."
https://openalex.org/W4205886347,"The mitochondrial enzyme glutaminase C (GAC) is upregulated in many cancer cells to catalyze the first step in glutamine metabolism, the hydrolysis of glutamine to glutamate. The dependence of cancer cells on this transformed metabolic pathway highlights GAC as a potentially important therapeutic target. GAC acquires maximal catalytic activity upon binding to anionic activators such as inorganic phosphate. To delineate the mechanism of GAC activation, we used the tryptophan substitution of tyrosine 466 in the catalytic site of the enzyme as a fluorescent reporter for glutamine binding in the presence and absence of phosphate. We show that in the absence of phosphate, glutamine binding to the Y466W GAC tetramer exhibits positive cooperativity. A high-resolution X-ray structure of tetrameric Y466W GAC bound to glutamine suggests that cooperativity in substrate binding is coupled to tyrosine 249, located at the edge of the catalytic site (i.e., the ""lid""), adopting two distinct conformations. In one dimer within the GAC tetramer, the lids are open and glutamine binds weakly, whereas, in the adjoining dimer, the lids are closed over the substrates, resulting in higher affinity interactions. When crystallized in the presence of glutamine and phosphate, all four subunits of the Y466W GAC tetramer exhibited bound glutamine with closed lids. Glutamine can bind with high affinity to each subunit, which subsequently undergo simultaneous catalysis. These findings explain how the regulated transitioning of GAC between different conformational states ensures that maximal catalytic activity is reached in cancer cells only when an allosteric activator is available."

https://openalex.org/W4205735306,"Obesity is a risk factor for insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases. Reticulon-4 (Nogo) is an endoplasmic reticulum–resident protein with unclear functions in obesity. Herein, we investigated the effect of Nogo on obesity and associated metabolic disorders. Human serum samples were collected to explore the relationship between circulating Nogo-B and body mass index value. Nogo-deficient and WT littermate control mice were fed normal chow or high-fat diet (HFD) for 14 weeks, and HFD-induced obese C57BL/6J mice were injected scrambled or Nogo siRNA for 2 weeks. We found that in human and mouse serum, Nogo-B was positively correlated to body mass index/bodyweight and lipid profiles. Reduced Nogo (by genetic deletion or siRNA transfection) protected mice against HFD-induced obesity and related metabolic disorders. We demonstrate that Nogo deficiency reversed HFD-induced whitening of brown adipose tissue, thereby increasing thermogenesis. It also ameliorated lipid accumulation in tissues by activating the adiponectin–adiponectin receptor 1–AMP-activated kinase α signaling axis. Finally, Nogo deficiency potently reduced HFD-induced serum proinflammatory cytokines and infiltration of macrophages into metabolic organs, which is related to enhanced NF-κB p65 degradation via the lysosome pathway.

Obesity has become a public health issue that impairs the quality of life, raises health care costs, and increases the risk of health complications, including insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases. The prevalence of obesity was 10.8% in men and 14.9% in women in 2014 and will increase to 18% and 21% by 2025 (1NCD Risk Factor Collaboration (NCD-RisC)Trends in adult body-mass index in 200 countries from 1975 to 2014: A pooled analysis of 1698 population-based measurement studies with 19.2 million participants.Lancet. 2016; 387: 1377-1396Google Scholar).

Guo C. Zhang L. Wang Q. Exosomes from adipose-derived stem cells attenuate adipose inflammation and obesity through polarizing M2 macrophages and beiging in white adipose tissue.Diabetes. 2018; 67: 235-247Google Scholar, 4Fink L.N.

Expansion of islet-resident macrophages leads to inflammation affecting β cell proliferation and function in obesity.Cell Metab. 2019; 29: 457-474Google Scholar). In turn, the inflammation in these tissues can aggravate obesity and obesity-associated complications, leading to vicious cycles. NF-κB is a key transcription factor controlling inflammatory process. NF-κB family consists of RelA/p65, RelB, c-Rel, p50/NF-κB1, and p52/NF-κB2 in mammals. They bind to target DNA as homodimers or heterodimers, of which the p65 and p50 heterodimers is the most common one (6Hayden M.S. Ghosh S. NF-κB, the first quarter-century: Remarkable progress and outstanding questions.Genes Dev. 2012; 26: 203-234Google Scholar). In physiological state, NF-κB locates in cytoplasm inactively. Once stimulated, it can translocate into nucleus and trigger the transcription of target genes including interlukin-1 (IL-1), IL-6, and interferon-γ (7Baker R.G. Hayden M.S. Ghosh S. NF-κB, inflammation, and metabolic disease.Cell Metab. 2011; 13: 11-22Google Scholar). NF-κB is deeply involved in the development of obesity and its complications (7Baker R.G. Hayden M.S. Ghosh S. NF-κB, inflammation, and metabolic disease.Cell Metab. 2011; 13: 11-22Google Scholar). Deficiency of NF-κB p50 protects mice against high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity, insulin resistance, and liver steatosis (8Minegishi Y. Haramizu S. Misawa K. Shimotoyodome A. Hase T. Murase T. Deletion of nuclear factor-κB p50 upregulates fatty acid utilization and contributes to an anti-obesity and high-endurance phenotype in mice.Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2015; 309: E523-E533Google Scholar). Liver-specific NF-κB p65 deletion ameliorates HFD-impaired insulin sensitivity (9Ke B. Zhao Z. Ye X. Gao Z. Manganiello V. Wu B. Ye J. Inactivation of NF-κB p65 (RelA) in liver improves insulin sensitivity and inhibits cAMP/PKA pathway.Diabetes. 2015; 64: 3355-3362Google Scholar). IL-1β, a target of NF-κB, is highly associated with human body mass index (BMI) and fasting blood glucose levels (10Misaki Y. Miyauchi R. Mochizuki K. Takabe S. Shimada M. Ichikawa Y. Goda T. Plasma interleukin-1β concentrations are closely associated with fasting blood glucose levels in healthy and preclinical middle-aged nonoverweight and overweight Japanese men.Metabolism. 2010; 59: 1465-1471Google Scholar). Inactivation of IL-1β protects mice against HFD-induced glucose tolerance and improves insulin secretion in type 2 diabetes patients (11McGillicuddy F.C. Harford K.A. Reynolds C.M. Oliver E.

The expression of Nogo family members is in a tissue-dependent manner. Nogo-A is mainly expressed in central nervous system, whereas Nogo-B is widely expressed in various tissues (13Zhang S. Yu M. Guo F. Yang X. Chen Y. Ma C. Li Q. Wei Z. Li X. Wang H. Hu H. Zhang Y. Kong D. Miao Q.R. Hu W. et al.Rosiglitazone alleviates intrahepatic cholestasis induced by α-naphthylisothiocyanate in mice: The role of circulating 15-deoxy-δ(12,14)-PGJ2 and Nogo.Br. J. Pharmacol. 2020; 177: 1041-1060Google Scholar). Nogo-B is the only member detectable in liver and circulation (14Zhang S. Guo F. Yu M. Yang X. Yao Z. Li Q. Wei Z. Feng K. Zeng P. Zhao D. Li X. Zhu Y. Miao Q.R. Iwakiri Y. Chen Y. et al.Reduced Nogo expression inhibits diet-induced metabolic disorders by regulating ChREBP and insulin activity.J. Hepatol. 2020; 73: 1482-1495Google Scholar). Several biological functions of Nogo have been reported. For instance, it influences ischemic injury and alcoholic liver disease by regulating macrophage infiltration and Kupffer cell polarization in mice (15Park J.K. Shao M. Kim M.Y. Baik S.K. Cho M.Y. Utsumi T. Satoh A. Ouyang X. Chung C. Iwakiri Y. An endoplasmic reticulum protein, Nogo-B, facilitates alcoholic liver disease through regulation of kupffer cell polarization.Hepatology. 2017; 65: 1720-1734Google Scholar, 16Yu J.

Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2009; 106: 17511-17516Google Scholar). Recently, we reported that reduced Nogo expression protected mice against high-carbohydrate diet–induced hepatic steatosis and insulin resistance by regulating carbohydrate-responsive element–binding protein and insulin activity (14Zhang S. Guo F. Yu M. Yang X. Yao Z. Li Q. Wei Z. Feng K. Zeng P. Zhao D. Li X. Zhu Y. Miao Q.R. Iwakiri Y. Chen Y. et al.Reduced Nogo expression inhibits diet-induced metabolic disorders by regulating ChREBP and insulin activity.J. Hepatol. 2020; 73: 1482-1495Google Scholar). These studies imply that Nogo can play an important role in different types of metabolic disorders. Obesity is contributed by different factors, such as chronic inflammation, imbalance between energy intake, and expenditure. Thus, we investigated if inhibited Nogo expression can reduce HFD-induced obesity by multiple mechanisms. Serum samples were collected from volunteers with different BMI values: underweight (BMI <18.5 kg/m2), normal (18.5 kg/m2 ≤ BMI <24 kg/m2), overweight (24 kg/m2 ≤ BMI <28 kg/m2), and obese (BMI ≥ 28 kg/m2), according to the obesity definition in China (17Wang Y. Mi J. Shan X.Y. Wang Q.J. Ge K.Y. Is China facing an obesity epidemic and the consequences? The trends in obesity and chronic disease in China.Int. J. Obes. (Lond.). 2007; 31: 177-188Google Scholar). We then determined levels of Nogo-B and lipid profiles (triglyceride [TG], total cholesterol [T-CHO], and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [LDL]) in human serum samples. As shown in Figure 1A, serum Nogo-B levels increased along with BMI increment. Furthermore, the correlation assay suggests that serum Nogo-B levels are positively correlated to BMI (R = 0.405; p = 0.004), TG (R = 0.321; p = 0.023), T-CHO (R = 0.315; p = 0.026), and LDL (R = 0.281; p = 0.049) (Fig. 1, B and C), indicating that circulating Nogo-B might be associated with development of obesity and its complications. To determine if tissue Nogo-B expression can be regulated by different dietary conditions, mice were fasted for 24 h and then refed normal chow for 12 h. Figure 1D shows that Nogo-B expression in liver, epididymal white adipose tissue (eWAT), and skeletal muscle was all increased by refeeding. Feeding mice an HFD (35% fat) or a high-cholesterol diet (21% fat plus 0.5% cholesterol) for 1 week also substantially upregulated Nogo-B expression in these tissues (Fig. 1, E and F). Thus, Nogo-B in circulation or tissues with high metabolic activity are increased with obesity or food containing high lipids. In mice, Nogo-A is mainly expressed in brain. Nogo-B is detectable in various tissues (Fig. S1, A and B). The high homology among Nogo family members indicates it is impossible to generate Nogo-B global-deficient mice (14Zhang S. Guo F. Yu M. Yang X. Yao Z. Li Q. Wei Z. Feng K. Zeng P. Zhao D. Li X. Zhu Y. Miao Q.R. Iwakiri Y. Chen Y. et al.Reduced Nogo expression inhibits diet-induced metabolic disorders by regulating ChREBP and insulin activity.J. Hepatol. 2020; 73: 1482-1495Google Scholar). Therefore, we used Nogo-deficient (Nogo−/− or Nogo KO) mice to investigate the pathophysiological functions of Nogo-B on HFD-induced obesity. Both Nogo−/− and littermate control (WT or Ctrl) mice were fed normal chow or HFD for 14 weeks. Compared with normal chow, HFD feeding substantially increased bodyweight in both littermate Ctrl and Nogo−/− mice. However, bodyweight gain was much less in Nogo−/− than WT mice, particularly by HFD (Fig. 2, A and B), indicating that Nogo deficiency inhibits HFD-induced obesity. No difference of food intake or excretion of TG and T-CHO in feces between two groups was determined, which confirms that the reduced bodyweight gain in Nogo−/− mice is not because of food consumption or absorption (Fig. 2, C–E). Using indirect calorimetry, we found that Nogo deficiency significantly increased body oxygen consumption and energy expenditure, whereas it had little effect on mice physical activity under HFD condition (Fig. S2). Collectively, aforementioned results indicate that Nogo deficiency ameliorates HFD-induced obesity by enhancing energy metabolism. Table S1 shows that Nogo deficiency significantly reduced postprandial hyperglycemia regardless of food types. Correspondingly, the obesity-induced glucose intolerance and insulin resistance were markedly ameliorated in Nogo−/− mice (Fig. 2, F and G), indicating that Nogo deficiency greatly improves HFD-impaired blood glucose homeostasis and insulin sensitivity. Nogo deficiency decreased mouse liver weight, whereas substantially increased interscapular brown adipose tissue (iBAT) weight under HFD feeding (Fig. 2H). Therefore, Nogo deficiency inhibits HFD-induced obesity and ameliorates obesity-associated indicators. Under the overnutrition, adipose tissue can expand rapidly to maintain nutrient homeostasis. HFD enlarged adipocytes in both WT and Nogo−/− mice with reduced effect on Nogo−/− mice (Fig. 3, A and B), indicating less lipid accumulation in eWAT of Nogo−/− mice. Adiponectin, an important adipokine secreted by adipose tissue, can improve insulin sensitivity and energy metabolism by activating AMP-activated kinase α (AMPKα) (18Scheja L. Heeren J. The endocrine function of adipose tissues in health and cardiometabolic disease.Nat. Rev. Endocrinol. 2019; 15: 507-524Google Scholar). Leptin, another major adipokine, is positively correlated to the bodyweight. Nogo−/− mice showed elevated adiponectin mRNA expression associated with increased circulating high–molecular weight (HMW) adiponectin (Figs. 3C and S3A). Nogo deficiency also reduced leptin mRNA level in eWAT under HFD condition (Fig. 3D). Adipose tissue expansion is not always accompanied by detrimental pathological changes. For instance, that featured by enhanced angiogenesis and reduced fibrosis is regarded as a healthy adipose tissue expansion (19Okuno Y. Fukuhara A. Hashimoto E. Kobayashi H. Kobayashi S. Otsuki M. Shimomura I. Oxidative stress inhibits healthy adipose expansion through suppression of SREBF1-mediated lipogenic pathway.Diabetes. 2018; 67: 1113-1127Google Scholar, 20Sun K. Kusminski C.M. Scherer P.E. Adipose tissue remodeling and obesity.J. Clin. Invest. 2011; 121: 2094-2101Google Scholar). Interestingly, Nogo deficiency activated expression of vascular endothelial growth factor β (Vegf-β), an angiogenesis-related gene, in HFD-fed mouse eWAT (Fig. 3E). Collagen VI is the main form of collagen produced by adipocytes (21Rosen E.D. Spiegelman B.M. What we talk about when we talk about fat.Cell. 2014; 156: 20-44Google Scholar). Nogo deficiency reduced HFD-activated collagen type VI α2 expression in eWAT (Fig. 3F). Correspondingly, the results of Sirius red staining further confirm reduced fibrosis in eWAT of Nogo−/− mice (Fig. 3G). Similarly, reduced adipocyte size, leptin, collagen type VI α1, and increased adiponectin and Vegf-β, were determined in the subcutaneous white adipose tissue (sc-WAT) of HFD-fed Nogo−/− mice (Fig. 3, H–N). Therefore, a healthy expansion occurs to Nogo−/− mouse adipose tissues under HFD feeding. To investigate the regulation of Nogo on aforementioned phenotypes, we first detected Nogo protein expression in adipocytes and stromal vascular fraction (SVF) from eWAT. As shown in Fig. S4A, Nogo protein levels in adipocytes and SVF were comparable and can be induced by HFD. Then, we constructed Nogo-deficient 3T3-L1 cells and found that Nogo deficiency attenuated palmitate-reduced adiponectin mRNA levels, whereas had little effect on Vegf-β mRNA expression in 3T3-L1–derived adipocytes (Fig. S4, B–D). In addition, the induction of transforming growth factor beta on collagen type VI α1 and collagen type VI α2 mRNA expression was ameliorated by Nogo deficiency (Fig. S4, E and F). Taken together, the effects of Nogo deficiency on adiponectin and collagen type VI α1 or α2 expression are partially dependent on the direct deficiency of Nogo in adipocytes. BAT, a metabolically active tissue, supports energy metabolism by converting lipids into heat. The high expression of Nogo-B in iBAT indicates that BAT may be a critical tissue affected by Nogo deficiency (Fig. S1A). HFD increased iBAT weight moderately in WT mice (∼45%) but potently in Nogo−/− mice (∼190%) (Fig. 2H). The increase of iBAT weight can be due to the browning of adipocytes and/or enlarged adipocyte size by lipid accumulation. The H&E staining of iBAT sections demonstrates that HFD increased iBAT adipocyte size in both WT (∼120%) and Nogo−/− mice (∼80%), indicating lipid accumulation occurred to cells. However, the average adipocyte size in HFD-fed Nogo−/− mice was smaller than that in WT mice (Fig. 4A), suggesting that more brown adipocytes are conserved, or obesity-induced iBAT whitening is reversed in HFD-fed mice by Nogo deficiency. Consistently, mRNA levels of brown adipocyte markers (uncoupling protein-1 [Ucp-1]; T-box transcription factor 1; and cell death–inducing DNA fragmentation factor-alpha–like effector α) were upregulated in HFD-fed Nogo−/− mice (Fig. 4B). HFD-decreased UCP-1 expression was partially restored by Nogo deficiency (Fig. 4, C and D). BAT stores lipid mainly in TG form and consumes fatty acids as thermogenic substrates (22Cannon B. Nedergaard J. Brown adipose tissue: Function and physiological significance.Physiol. Rev. 2004; 84: 277-359Google Scholar). Therefore, we evaluated expression of TG hydrolysis–related genes (hormone-sensitive lipase and adipose TG lipase) and fatty acid oxidation–related genes (carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1β; cytochrome C oxidase subunit 5b and 8b; and NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit b2) in the tissue and observed that these genes were all notably upregulated in HFD-fed Nogo−/− mice (Fig. 4, E and F). To further confirm the role of Nogo in adipocyte browning and thermogenesis, we performed the cold adaptation experiment, in which both WT and Nogo−/− mice were housed in 24 h cycles of 12 h at 4 °C and another 12 h at room temperature for 1 week. Compared with mice under room temperature (Fig. S1A), Nogo-B protein levels were much lower in iBAT and sc-WAT than eWAT under cold exposure condition (Fig. S5A), further indicating the involvement of Nogo in thermogenesis. After cold exposure, Nogo deficiency increased mouse body temperature, weight of iBAT and sc-WAT, and multilocular beige cells in sc-WAT (Fig. 4, H–J). In addition, it increased UCP-1 expression in sc-WAT and iBAT and expression of PR domain containing 16 and deiodonase 2 mRNA (two BAT markers) in iBAT (Fig. 4, K and M–O). Thus, Nogo deficiency can promote adipose tissue browning and thermogenesis. To determine whether Nogo regulates thermogenesis in a cell autonomous mechanism, we first detected Nogo protein levels in adipocytes and SVF from iBAT. As shown in Fig. S5B, Nogo-B protein expression was much higher in adipocytes than SVF. In vitro, we transfected C3H10T1/2 cell-derived brown adipocytes with Nogo siRNA or Nogo expression vector, followed by isoproterenol treatment (a β-adrenoreceptor agonist that can stimulate thermogenesis). The results in Fig. S5, C and D showed that Nogo knockdown increased UCP-1 expression, whereas Nogo overexpression reduced UCP-1 protein levels. Thus, Nogo regulates thermogenesis in a cell-autonomous manner, at least partly. The reduced liver weight in HFD-fed Nogo−/− mice (Fig. 2H) implies that Nogo deficiency may inhibit obesity-induced hepatic steatosis. Indeed, both H&E and Oil red O staining demonstrate that Nogo deficiency substantially blocked HFD-increased hepatic lipid accumulation, evidenced by fewer vacuoles in H&E staining and lighter Oil red O staining (Fig. 5A). Consistently, Nogo deficiency reduced HFD-increased TG and free fatty acid (FFA) levels in the liver (Fig. 5, B and C). It also reduced circulating TG (Table S1), whereas had little effect on liver T-CHO levels (Fig. 5D). Although mRNA expression of TG synthesis (diacylglycerol O-acyltransferase), fatty acid uptake–related genes (fatty acid–binding protein 1 and 4), or synthesis-related genes (acetyl-CoA carboxylase α and stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 [Scd1]), or protein expression of fatty acid synthase and SCD was not influenced by Nogo deficiency (Figs. 5E and S6), mRNA expression of TG hydrolysis–related genes (hormone-sensitive lipase and adipose TG lipase) and fatty acid oxidation–related genes (acyl-CoA oxidase 1 and 2; peroxisome proliferator–activated receptor [PPAR] gamma coactivator 1α [Pgc-1α]; and carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1α) was markedly upregulated in HFD-fed Nogo−/− mice (Fig. 5, E and F), suggesting that ameliorated HFD-induced hepatic lipid accumulation by Nogo deficiency is related to activation of TG hydrolysis and fatty acid oxidation or energy metabolism. AMPKα is a pivotal regulator in energy metabolism, and activated AMPKα (phosphorylated AMPKα [p-AMPKα]) can increase lipid oxidation. In agreement with the aforementioned results, p-AMPKα was significantly increased in Nogo−/− mouse liver (Fig. 5G). Circulating adiponectin can activate AMPKα by binding to adiponectin receptor 1 (AdipoR1) (23Yamauchi T. Kamon J. Ito Y. Tsuchida A. Yokomizo T. Kita S. Sugiyama T. Miyagishi M. Hara K. Tsunoda M. Murakami K. Ohteki T. Uchida S. Takekawa S. Waki H. et al.Cloning of adiponectin receptors that mediate antidiabetic metabolic effects.Diabetes. 2003; 423: 762-769Google Scholar). Nogo deficiency increased AdipoR1 expression and serum HMW adiponectin in HFD-fed mice (Figs. 5, G and H and S3A). Therefore, much higher p-AMPKα was observed in Nogo−/− mice than WT mice at HFD feeding. Consistent with the results in in vivo study, protein levels of AdipoR1 and p-AMPKα in Nogo-deficient HepG2 (Nogo-Cas9) cells were also higher than Ctrl-Cas9 HepG2 cells, and the activation of AMPKα by AdipoRon (AdipoR1 agonist) was abolished in Nogo-Cas9 cells by AdipoR1 siRNA (Fig. S3, B and C), indicating that Nogo deficiency promotes adiponectin-induced p-AMPKα in an AdipoR1-dependent manner. Nogo deficiency also restored HFD-reduced PGC-1α and phosphorylated AKT (p-AKT) protein in mouse liver (Fig. 5G). These data suggest that Nogo deficiency promotes lipid oxidation through adiponectin–AdipoR1–AMPKα pathway, thereby improving obesity-induced metabolic disorders in the liver. Obesity also elevates blood lipid levels and enhances lipid uptake in adipose tissue and skeletal muscle. The excess ectopic lipid accumulation in skeletal muscle can influence tissue functions (24Kalinkovich A. Livshits G. Sarcopenic obesity or obese sarcopenia: A cross talk between age-associated adipose tissue and skeletal muscle inflammation as a main mechanism of the pathogenesis.Ageing Res. Rev. 2017; 35: 200-221Google Scholar). Similar to the liver (Fig. 5B), Nogo deficiency also reduced HFD-induced TG accumulation in skeletal muscle (Fig. 5I). PGC-1α is a key regulator of energy metabolism and mitochondrial biogenesis (25Wu Z. Puigserver P. Andersson U. Zhang C. Adelmant G. Mootha V. Troy A. Cinti S. Lowell B. Scarpulla R.C. Spiegelman B.M. Mechanisms controlling mitochondrial biogenesis and respiration through the thermogenic coactivator PGC-1.Cell. 1999; 98: 115-124Google Scholar). Nuclear respiratory factor 1 is a main target of PGC-1α in this process. Compared with WT mice, Nogo deficiency activated PGC-1α protein expression (Fig. 5J). mRNA levels of nuclear respiratory factor 1 and mitochondrial lipid oxidation–related genes (carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1β; aconitase 2; and cytochrome C oxidase subunit 4 isoform 1) were also activated by Nogo deficiency in HFD-fed mouse skeletal muscle (Fig. 5, K and L). In addition, Nogo deficiency increased p-AMPKα, PPARα, and AdipoR1 expression in the tissue (Figs. 5M and S3, E and F). HFD feeding increased protein kinase C ε, an inhibitor of insulin signaling, which was substantially blocked by Nogo deficiency (Fig. 5M). Therefore, Nogo deficiency also ameliorates HFD-induced lipid accumulation and insulin resistance in mouse skeletal muscle. The effect of Nogo deficiency on systemic inflammation was determined by a protein array assay (Fig. 6A). HFD feeding increased levels of various proinflammatory cytokines in WT mice serum. However, Nogo deficiency substantially blocked HFD-induced expression of these molecules (Figs. 6A and S7). Crown-like structure, a histological hallmark of obesity-associated adipose tissue inflammation, is composed of macrophages surrounding adipocytes. Figure 6B shows that Nogo deficiency reduced the number of crown-like structure in eWAT. HFD-activated infiltration of macrophages into liver, iBAT, and islet was also significantly decreased by Nogo deficiency (Fig. 6, C–E). Moreover, the percentages of anti-inflammatory M2 macrophages in eWAT and iBAT were increased in HFD-fed Nogo−/− mice, associated with reduced proinflammatory M1 macrophages (Fig. 6, F–I). These results suggest that Nogo deficiency decreases expression of proinflammatory cytokines, prevents macrophages from being recruited into metabolic organs, and drives polarization of macrophages into M2 phenotype. In addition to be a critical regulator of inflammatory cytokine expression, NF-κB also induces macrophage infiltration into tissues and M1 type differentiation (26Chen D. Xie J. Fiskesund R. Dong W. Liang X. Lv J. Jin X. Liu J. Mo S. Zhang T. Cheng F. Zhou Y. Zhang H. Tang K. Ma J. et al.Chloroquine modulates antitumor immune response by resetting tumor-associated macrophages toward M1 phenotype.Nat. Commun. 2018; 9: 873Google Scholar). Our results demonstrate that Nogo deficiency not only potently blocked HFD-activated expression of inflammatory cytokines, particularly the molecules regulated by NF-κB (CD40, CD178 [FAS ligand], granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, interferon-γ, IL-1, IL-12, IL-17, and macrophage inflammatory protein 3α/β [C–C motif chemokine ligand 20 or 19]) (Fig. 6A and S7) but also reduced HFD-induced macrophage infiltration and M1 polarization (Fig. 6, B–I). These data imply that NF-κB may play an important role in Nogo deficiency–inhibited inflammation and obesity. NF-κB p65 is the main subunit of NF-κB protein. As shown in Figure 7, A and B, lack of Nogo expression not only reduced the basal level of NF-κB p65 but also potentially blocked HFD-activated NF-κB p65 protein expression in mouse liver, WAT, skeletal muscle, iBAT, pancreas, and macrophages in eWAT. Associated with changes in NF-κB p65 protein expression, we determined that Nogo deficiency reduced nuclear NF-κB p65 protein levels in mouse liver (Fig. 7C). Consistent with reduced NF-κB p65 activation, HFD-activated mRNA expression of inflammation cytokines (Il-1β, tumor necrosis factor alpha [Tnf-α], and Il-6) and macrophage chemokine (monocyte chemoattractant protein 1) was decreased in Nogo−/− mice in HFD condition (Figs. 7D and S8A). To further determine the effect of NF-κB p65 on Nogo deficiency–inhibited inflammation cytokine expression and macrophage infiltration, we transfected Ctrl (Ctrl-Cas9) and Nogo-deficient (Nogo-Cas9) HepG2 cells with NF-κB p65 expression vector, followed by treatment with palmitate (mimic high-fat environment). Consistent with the in vivo results, Nogo deficiency blocked palmitate-activated mRNA expression of IL-1β, IL-6, and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (Fig. 7E). However, these inhibitory effects of Nogo deficiency were abolished by NF-κB p65 overexpression (Fig. 7E). Taken together, the amelioration of Nogo deficiency on obesity-induced inflammation and macrophage infiltration is dependent on NF-κB p65 inactivation. IκB can bind to NF-κB and trap it in the cytoplasm. To investigate the underlying mechanisms by which reduced Nogo inactivates NF-κB, we detected IκB and NF-κB p65 protein expression in Ctrl and Nogo-deficient peritoneal macrophages. As shown in Fig. S8C, Nogo deficiency significantly decreased total NF-κB p65 but not IκB levels, indicating that Nogo may regulate NF-κB p65 nuclear translocation by affecting its total protein expression rather than IκB. The results in Figure 8A showed that NF-κB p65 was increased in 293T cells by high-ex"

https://openalex.org/W4220935076,"Abstract The membrane-anchored Src tyrosine kinase is involved in numerous pathways and its deregulation is involved in human cancer. Our knowledge on Src regulation relies on crystallography, which revealed intramolecular interactions to control active Src conformations. However, Src contains a N-terminal intrinsically disordered unique domain (UD) whose function remains unclear. Using NMR, we reported that UD forms an intramolecular fuzzy complex involving a conserved region with lipid-binding capacity named Unique Lipid-Binding Region (ULBR), which could modulate Src membrane anchoring. Here we show that the ULBR is essential for Src’s oncogenic capacity. ULBR inactive mutations inhibited Src transforming activity in NIH3T3 cells and in human colon cancer cells. It also reduced Src-induced tumor development in nude mice. An intact ULBR was required for MAPK signaling without affecting Src kinase activity nor sub-cellular localization. Phospho-proteomic analyses revealed that, while not impacting on the global tyrosine phospho-proteome in colon cancer cells, this region modulates phosphorylation of specific membrane-localized tyrosine kinases needed for Src oncogenic signaling, including EPHA2 and Fyn. Collectively, this study reveals an important role of this intrinsically disordered region in malignant cell transformation and suggests a novel layer of Src regulation by this unique region via membrane substrate phosphorylation."

We generate a Pb-Csf1 mouse model with prostate-specific overexpression of macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-Csf/Csf1). Csf1 overexpression promotes immune cell infiltration into the prostate, modulates the macrophage polarity in a lobe-specific manner, and induces senescence and low-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN). The Pb-Csf1 prostate luminal cells exhibit increased stem cell features and undergo an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. Human prostate cancer patients with high CSF-1 expression display similar transcriptional alterations with the Pb-Csf1 model. P53 knockout alleviates senescence but fails to progress PIN lesions. Ablating epithelial Gp130 but not Il1r1 substantially blocks PIN lesion formation. The androgen receptor (AR) is downregulated in Pb-Csf1 mice. ChIP-Seq analysis reveals altered AR binding in 2482 genes although there is no significant widespread change in global AR transcriptional activity. Collectively, our study demonstrates that increased macrophage infiltration causes PIN formation but fails to transform prostate cells."
https://openalex.org/W4206049242,"Previously, we identified Puf-A as a novel member of Puf-family RNA-binding proteins; however, its biological functions remain obscure. Analysis of tumor samples of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) showed that high Puf-A expression correlated with high histology grade and abnormal p53 status. Kaplan-Meier curve for overall survival revealed high expression of Puf-A to predict poor prognosis in stage I NSCLC. Among patients with colorectal cancer, high Puf-A expression also showed an adverse impact on overall survival. In lung cancer cell lines, downregulation of p53 increased Puf-A expression, and upregulation of p53 dampened its expression. However, luciferase reporter assays indicated that PUF-A locus harbored the p53-response element, but regulated Puf-A transcription indirectly. In vivo suppression of p53 in CCSP-rtTA/TetO-Cre/LSL-KrasG12D/p53flox/flox conditional mutant mice accelerated the progression of the KrasG12D-driven lung cancer, along with enhanced expression of Puf-A. Importantly, intranasal delivery of shPuf-A to the inducible KrasG12D/p53flox/flox mice suppressed tumor progression. Puf-A silencing led to marked decreases in the 80S ribosomes, along with decrease in S6 and L5 in the cytoplasm and accumulation in the nucleolus. Based on immunofluorescence staining and immunoprecipitation studies, Puf-A interacted with NPM1 in nucleolus. Puf-A silencing resulted in NPM1 translocation from nucleolus to nucleoplasm and this disruption of NPM1 localization was reversed by a rescue experiment. Mechanistically, Puf-A silencing altered NPM1 localization, leading to the retention of ribosomal proteins in nucleolus and diminished ribosome biogenesis, followed by cell-cycle arrest/cell death. Puf-A is a potential theranostic target for cancer therapy and an important player in cancer progression."
https://openalex.org/W4206669730,"Selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) interacts with estrogen receptors and acts as both an agonist or an antagonist, depending on the target tissue. SERM is widely used as a safer hormone replacement therapeutic medicine for postmenopausal osteoporosis. Regarding hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), accumulating evidence indicates gender differences in the development, and that men are at higher morbidity risk than premenopausal women, suggesting that estrogen protects against HCC. However, it remains unclear whether SERM affects the HCC progression. Previously, we have shown that transforming growth factor (TGF)-α promotes the migration of HCC cells via p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK), c-Jun N-terminal kinase and AKT. In the present study, we investigated whether SERM such as tamoxifen, raloxifene and bazedoxifene, affects the HCC cell migration using human HCC-derived HuH7 cells. Raloxifene and bazedoxifene but not tamoxifen, significantly suppressed the TGF-α-induced HuH7 cell migration. ERB041 and DPN, estrogen receptor (ER) β agonists, inhibited the TGF-α-induced cell migration whereas PPT, an ERα agonist, did not show the suppressive effect on the cell migration. ERB041 attenuated the TGF-α-induced phosphorylation of AKT without affecting the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and c-Jun N-terminal kinase. Raloxifene and bazedoxifene also inhibited the phosphorylation of AKT by TGF-α. Furthermore, PHTPP, an ERβ antagonist, significantly reversed the suppression by both raloxifene and bazedoxifene of the TGF-α-induced cell migration. Taken together, our results strongly indicate that raloxifene and bazedoxifene, SERMs, suppress the TGF-α-induced migration of HCC cells through ERβ-mediated inhibition of the AKT signaling pathway."
https://openalex.org/W4206788159,"Corneal injury and aberrant wound healing commonly result in corneal fibrosis and subsequent vision loss. Intermediate-conductance calmodulin/calcium-activated K+ channels (K Ca 3.1) have been shown to promote fibrosis in non-ocular and ocular tissues via upregulation of transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ). TRAM-34 is a selective inhibitor of K Ca 3.1 and reduces fibrosis by downregulation of TGFβ-induced transdifferentiation of stromal fibroblasts to myofibroblasts. Ascorbic acid has been demonstrated to be effective in promoting corneal re-epithelialization and reduction of neovascularization via anti-VEGF and anti-MMP mechanisms. This study evaluates tolerability and efficacy of a novel combination of TRAM-34 (25μM) and ascorbic acid (10%) topical treatment for corneal fibrosis using an established in vivo rabbit model and conducting clinical eye examinations. Markers of corneal fibrosis were evaluated in all corneas at study endpoint via histopathology, immunofluorescence, and quantitative real-time PCR. The eyedrop treated eyes showed significantly improved clinical outcomes based on modified McDonald Shadduck scores, reduction of clinical haze on Fantes scores, and reduction of central corneal thickness (CCT). At cellular and molecular levels, eyedrop treatment also significantly reduced expression of alpha smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) mRNA and protein, collagen III mRNA, and fibronectin mRNA compared to non-treated eyes. Our study suggests that a tested new bimodal eyedrop is well tolerated and effectively reduces corneal fibrosis/haze in rabbits in vivo ."
https://openalex.org/W4206975847,"Trehalose is the major ""blood sugar"" of insects and it plays a crucial role in energy supply and as a stress protectant. The hydrolysis of trehalose occurs only under the enzymatic control of trehalase (Treh), which plays important roles in growth and development, energy supply, chitin biosynthesis, and abiotic stress responses. Previous reports have revealed that the vital hormone 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) regulates Treh, but the detailed mechanism underlying 20E regulating Treh remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the function of HaTreh1 in Helicoverpa armigera larvae. The results showed that the transcript levels and enzymatic activity of HaTreh1 were elevated during molting and metamorphosis stages in the epidermis, midgut, and fat body, and that 20E upregulated the transcript levels of HaTreh1 through the classical nuclear receptor complex EcR-B1/USP1. HaTreh1 is a mitochondria protein. We also found that knockdown of HaTreh1 in the fifth- or sixth-instar larvae resulted in weight loss and increased mortality. Yeast two-hybrid, coimmunoprecipitation, and glutathione-S-transferase (GST) pull-down experiments demonstrated that HaTreh1 bound with ATP synthase subunit alpha (HaATPs-α) and that this binding increased under 20E treatment. In addition, 20E enhanced the transcript level of HaATPs-α and ATP content. Finally, the knockdown of HaTreh1 or HaATPs-α decreased the induction effect of 20E on ATP content. Altogether, these findings demonstrate that 20E controls ATP production by up-regulating the binding of HaTreh1 to HaATPs-α in H. armigera."
https://openalex.org/W4205095760,"DNA methylation is an epigenetic modification critical for the regulation of chromatin structure and gene expression during development and disease. The ten-eleven translocation (TET) enzyme family catalyzes the hydroxymethylation and subsequent demethylation of DNA by oxidizing 5-methylcytosine (5mC) to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC). Little is known about TET protein function due to a lack of pharmacological tools to manipulate DNA hydroxymethylation levels. In this study, we examined the role of TET-mediated DNA hydroxymethylation during BMP-induced C2C12 osteoblast differentiation using a novel cytosine-based selective TET enzyme inhibitor, Bobcat339 (BC339). Treatment of C2C12 cells with BC339 increased global 5mC and decreased global 5hmC without adversely affecting cell viability, proliferation, or apoptosis. Furthermore, BC339 treatment inhibited osteoblast marker gene expression and decreased alkaline phosphatase activity during differentiation. Methylated DNA immunoprecipitation and bisulfite sequencing showed that inhibition of TET with BC339 led to increased 5mC at specific CpG-rich regions at the promoter of Sp7, a key osteoblast transcription factor. Consistent with promoter 5mC marks being associated with transcriptional repression, luciferase activity of an Sp7-promoter-reporter construct was repressed by in vitro DNA methylation or BC339. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis confirmed that TET2 does indeed occupy the promoter region of Sp7. Accordingly, forced overexpression of SP7 rescued the inhibition of osteogenic differentiation by BC339. In conclusion, our data suggest that TET-mediated DNA demethylation of genomic regions, including the Sp7 promoter, plays a role in the initiation of osteoblast differentiation. Furthermore, BC339 is a novel pharmacological tool for the modulation of DNA methylation dynamics for research and therapeutic applications."
https://openalex.org/W4205183691,"Extracellular vesicles are released into body fluids from the majority of, if not all, cell types. Because their secretion and specific cargo (e.g., proteins) varies according to pathology, extracellular vesicles may prove a rich source of biomarkers. However, their biological and pathophysiological functions are poorly understood in hematological malignancies.Here, we investigated proteome changes in the exosome-rich fraction of the plasma of myelodysplastic syndrome patients and healthy donors.Exosome-rich fraction of the plasma was isolated using ExoQuick™: proteomes were compared and statistically processed; proteins were identified by nanoLC-MS/MS and verified using the ExoCarta and QuickGO databases. Mann-Whitney and Spearman analyses were used to statistically analyze the data. 2D western blot was used to monitor clusterin proteoforms.Statistical analyses of the data highlighted clusterin alterations as the most significant. 2D western blot showed that the clusterin changes were caused by posttranslational modifications. Moreover, there was a notable increase in the clusterin proteoform in the exosome-rich fraction of plasma of patients with more severe myelodysplastic syndrome; this corresponded with a simultaneous decrease in their plasma.This specific clusterin proteoform seems to be a promising biomarker for myelodysplastic syndrome progression."
https://openalex.org/W4206083187,"Metastasis-initiating cells (MICs) display stem cell-like features, cause metastatic recurrences and defy chemotherapy, which leads to patients' demise. Here we show that prostate and breast cancer patients harbor contingents of tumor cells with high expression of CX3CR1, OCT4a (POU5F1), and NANOG. Impairing CX3CR1 expression or signaling hampered the formation of tumor spheroids by cell lines from which we isolated small subsets co-expressing CX3CR1 and stemness-related markers, similarly to patients' tumors. These rare CX3CR1High cells show transcriptomic profiles enriched in pathways that regulate pluripotency and endowed with metastasis-initiating behavior in murine models. Cancer cells lacking these features (CX3CR1Low) were capable of re-acquiring CX3CR1-associated features over time, implying that MICs can continuously emerge from non-stem cancer cells. CX3CR1 expression also conferred resistance to docetaxel, and prolonged treatment with docetaxel selected CX3CR1High phenotypes with de-enriched transcriptomic profiles for apoptotic pathways. These findings nominate CX3CR1 as a novel marker of stem-like tumor cells and provide conceptual ground for future development of approaches targeting CX3CR1 signaling and (re)expression as therapeutic means to prevent or contain metastasis initiation."

This study investigated the effects of TC on nitrogen removal using a Moving Bed Biofilm Reactor system. The results showed that there was no significant effect on nitrogen removal performance when the concentration of TC was 5 mg/L, and that the total nitrogen (TN) removal efficiency could reach 75–77%. However, when the concentration of TC increased to 10 mg/L, the denitrification performance was affected and the TN removal efficiency decreased to 58%. The abundance of denitrifying bacteria such as those in the genus Thauera decreased, and TC-resistant bacteria gradually became dominant. At a TC concentration of 10 mg/L, there were also increases and decreases, respectively, in the abundance of resistance and denitrification functional genes. The inhibitory effect of TC on denitrification was achieved mainly by the inhibition of nitrite-reducing bacteria."
https://openalex.org/W4206601891,"The burden of cardiovascular disease (CVD) is increasing in sub-Saharan Africa with untreated hypertension being a major contributing factor. Understanding the magnitude of the problem and risk factors associated with HIV and long-term antiretroviral therapy (ART) is critically important for designing effective programs for diagnosing and treating hypertension in Kenya.In this cross-sectional study, we enrolled 300 persons with HIV (PWH) on long term ART (≥6 months) and 298 HIV-negative adults seeking care at the Kisumu County Hospital between September 2017 and May 2018. Hypertension was defined as blood pressure of ≥140/90mmHg or a previous hypertension diagnosis. Multivariate regression was used to assess the association between hypertension and HIV adjusting for age, sex, and known CVD risk factors.Overall prevalence of hypertension was 22%. PWH had a lower prevalence of hypertension than HIV-negative persons (16% vs 27% respectively; p<0.002). In multivariate analyses, persons with HIV were 37% less likely to have hypertension compared to HIV-negative individuals (adjusted prevalence ratio 0.63; 95% confidence interval: 0.46-0.86). Other factors that were associated with hypertension in all participants included older age >40 years, body mass index (BMI) >25 kg/m2 and low-density lipoproteins ≥130mg/dL. Among PWH, being older than 40 years and higher BMI >30 kg/m2 were associated with hypertension.Prevalence of hypertension was high, affecting nearly one in every 4 adults, and associated with older age, higher BMI and high low-density lipoproteins. PWH on long-term ART had significantly lower prevalence of hypertension compared to HIV-negative individuals, potentially due to increased access to healthcare services and interaction with prevention messaging. Interventions to increase screening for and prevention of hypertension in the community for all adults are warranted."
https://openalex.org/W4205936600,"Despite numerous investigations into ocular or corneal astigmatism, the dynamic nature of astigmatism remains poorly understood. To reveal potential associations between age and astigmatism, 264 Japanese participants who underwent systemic and ophthalmological examinations in Funagata Town (Yamagata Prefecture, Japan) were evaluated over a 10-year period. Astigmatism was evaluated with regard to the cylinder power, cylinder axis, and vector analyses. Whereas the refractive cylinders showed age-related increases in patients in their 40s to 60s, the corneal cylinders did not change over 10 years. Nevertheless, cylindrical axis of the cornea demonstrated a continuous shift toward against-the-rule (ATR) astigmatism. Vector analyses revealed that the astigmatic shift toward ATR progressed continually after patients reached their 40s, although the shift did not accelerate with age. These novel insights may pave the way for the development of potential strategies for vision correction, including refractive surgeries, and vision-quality maintenance in the elderly."

https://openalex.org/W4206063077,"Osteoarthritis (OA), the most prevalent joint disease, is characterized by the progressive loss of articular cartilage. Autophagy, a lysosomal degradation pathway, maintains cellular homeostasis, and autophagic dysfunction in chondrocytes is a hallmark of OA pathogenesis. However, the cause of autophagic dysfunction in OA chondrocytes remains incompletely understood. Recent studies have reported that decidual protein induced by progesterone (C10orf10/DEPP) positively regulates autophagic functions. In this study, we found that DEPP was involved in mitochondrial autophagic functions of chondrocytes, as well as in OA pathogenesis. DEPP expression decreased in human OA chondrocytes in the absence or presence of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and was induced by starvation, hydrogen peroxide (H2 O2 ), and hypoxia (cobalt chloride). For functional studies, DEPP knockdown decreased autophagic flux induced by H2 O2 , whereas DEPP overexpression increased autophagic flux and maintained cell viability following H2 O2 treatment. DEPP was downregulated by knockdown of forkhead box class O (FOXO) transcription factors and modulated the autophagic function regulated by FOXO3. In an OA mouse model by destabilization of the medial meniscus, DEPP-knockout mice exacerbated the progression of cartilage degradation with TUNEL-positive cells, and chondrocytes isolated from knockout mice were decreased autophagic flux and increased cell death following H2 O2 treatment. Subcellular fractionation analysis revealed that mitochondria-located DEPP activated mitochondrial autophagy via BCL2 interacting protein 3. Taken together, our data demonstrate that DEPP is a major stress-inducible gene involved in the activation of mitochondrial autophagy in chondrocytes, and maintains chondrocyte viability during OA pathogenesis. DEPP represents a potential therapeutic target for enhancing autophagy in patients with OA."
https://openalex.org/W4206545790,"Hypoxia exerts profound effects on cell physiology, but its effect on colonic uptake of the microbiota-generated forms of vitamin B1 (i.e., thiamin pyrophosphate [TPP] and free thiamine) has not been described. Here, we used human colonic epithelial NCM460 cells and human differentiated colonoid monolayers as in vitro and ex vivo models, respectively, and were subjected to either chamber (1% O2, 5% CO2, and 94% N2) or chemically (desferrioxamine; 250 μM)-induced hypoxia followed by determination of different physiological-molecular parameters. We showed that hypoxia causes significant inhibition in TPP and free thiamin uptake by colonic NCM460 cells and colonoid monolayers; it also caused a significant reduction in the expression of TPP (SLC44A4) and free thiamin (SLC19A2 and SLC19A3) transporters and in activity of their gene promoters. Furthermore, hypoxia caused a significant induction in levels of hypoxia-inducible transcription factor (HIF)-1α but not HIF-2α. Knocking down HIF-1α using gene-specific siRNAs in NCM460 cells maintained under hypoxic conditions, on the other hand, led to a significant reversal in the inhibitory effect of hypoxia on TPP and free thiamin uptake as well as on the expression of their transporters. Finally, a marked reduction in level of expression of the nuclear factors cAMP responsive element-binding protein 1 and gut-enriched Krüppel-like factor 4 (required for activity of SLC44A4 and SLC19A2 promoters, respectively) was observed under hypoxic conditions. In summary, hypoxia causes severe inhibition in colonic TPP and free thiamin uptake that is mediated at least in part via HIF-1α-mediated transcriptional mechanisms affecting their respective transporters."
https://openalex.org/W4226395025,"Thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), a type I cytokine belonging to the IL-2 cytokine family, promotes Th2-mediated inflammatory responses. The aim of this study is to investigate whether TSLP increases inflammatory responses via induction of autophagy using a murine T cell lymphoma cell line, EL4 cells, and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-injected mice. TSLP increased expression levels of autophagy-related factors, such as Beclin-1, LC3-II, p62, Atg5, and lysosome associated membrane protein 1/2, whereas these factors increased by TSLP disappeared by neutralization of TSLP in EL4 cells. TSLP activated JAK1/JAK2/STAT5/JNK/PI3K, while the blockade of JAK1/JAK2/STAT5/JNK/PI3K signaling pathways reduced the expression levels of Beclin-1, LC3-II, and p62 in TSLP-stimulated EL4 cells. In addition, TSLP simultaneously increased levels of inflammatory cytokines via induction of autophagy by activation of JAK1/JAK2/STAT5/JNK/PI3K signaling pathways. In an LPS-induced acute liver injury (ALI) mouse model, exogenous TSLP increased expression levels of Beclin-1 and LC3-II, whereas functional deficiency of TSLP by TSLP siRNA resulted in lower expression of Beclin-1, LC3-II, and inflammatory cytokines, impairing their ability to form autophagosomes in ALI mice. Thus, our findings show a new role of TSLP between autophagy and inflammatory responses. In conclusion, regulating TSLP-induced autophagy may be a potential therapeutic strategy for inflammatory responses."
https://openalex.org/W4205241158,"Pain variability can be partially attributed to psycho-cognitive features involved in its processing. However, accumulating research suggests that simple linear correlation between situational and dispositional factors may not be sufficiently explanatory, with some positing a role for mediating influences. In addition, acute pain processing studies generally focus on a post-operative model with less attention provided to post-traumatic injury. As such, this study aimed to investigate a more comprehensive pain processing model that included direct and indirect associations between acute pain intensity in the head and neck, pain catastrophizing (using pain catastrophizing scale (PCS)), and pain sensitivity (using the pain sensitivity questionnaire (PSQ)), among 239 patients with post-motor vehicle collision pain. The effect of personality traits (using Ten Items Personality Inventory (TIPI)) and emotional status (using Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and Perceived Stress Scale (PSS)) on that model was examined as well. To this end, three Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) analyses were conducted. Overall, the data had good fit to all the models, with only PSQ found to have a direct correlation with acute pain intensity. The SEM analyses conversely revealed several mediations. Specifically, that: first, PSQ fully mediated the relationship between PCS and pain intensity; second, PCS and PSQ together fully mediated the relationship between conscientiousness (personality trait) and pain intensity; and finally, emotional status had direct and indirect links with PSQ and pain intensity. In conclusion, these models suggest that during the acute post-collision phase, pain sensitivity intermediates between emotional states and personality traits, partially via elevated pain catastrophizing thoughts."

This study aims to conduct a needs assessment survey and obtain individual and facility-level data on expertise and readiness for neonatal resuscitation. We hypothesize that neonatal emergency preparedness among healthcare providers in Kano, Nigeria is associated with the level of knowledge, attitudinal disposition, practice and equipment availability at the facility level.A semi-structured, self-administered questionnaire was administered to a cross-section of health providers directly involved with neonatal care (n = 112) and attending a neonatal resuscitation workshop in Kano state. Information regarding knowledge, attitude, practice and facility preparedness for neonatal resuscitation was obtained. Bloom's cut-off score and a validated basic emergency obstetric and neonatal care assessment tool were adopted to categorize outcomes. Multivariable logistic regression was employed to determine independent predictors of knowledge and practice.Almost half (48% and 42% respectively) of the respondents reported average level of self-assessed knowledge and comfort during resuscitation. Only 7% (95% CI:3.2-13.7) and 5% (95% CI:2.0-11.4) of health providers demonstrated good knowledge and practice scores respectively, with an overall facility preparedness of 46%. Respondents' profession as a physician compared to nurses and midwives predicted good knowledge (aOR = 0.08, 95% CI: 0.01-0.69; p = 0.01), but not practice.Healthcare provider's knowledge and practice including facility preparedness for emergency neonatal resuscitation were suboptimal, despite the respondents' relatively high self-assessed attitudinal perception. Physicians demonstrated higher knowledge compared to other health professionals. The low level of respondents' awareness, practice, and facility readiness suggest the current weak state of secondary health systems in Kano."

However, low quality of care provided at AFHCs by counsellors calls for attention. We, thus, explore both the clients' and providers' perspectives using the World Health Organization's (WHO) global standards for quality health-care services for adolescents to assess the quality of the sexual reproductive health service delivery at AFHCs in Rajasthan, India. We conducted a qualitative study, comprising observation of the service delivery using mystery clients (MCs) (n = 12) and in-depth interviews with the counsellors (n = 4) in four AFHCs. Interviews were transcribed in local language and were translated in English. The transcripts were coded thematically. Our study, using five of the eight WHO global standards for quality health-care services for adolescents highlighted several gaps in the quality-of-service delivery at AFHCs. We unearth various intricacies related to the quality of the services provided at the AFHCs by referring to the relevant input, process, and the output criteria of WHO global standards I, III, IV, V and VI. Our study calls for efforts to improve- (i) the counsellors' competencies to increase adolescents' health literacy on sensitive topics, (ii) the facilities at the clinic to ensure privacy, comfort and confidentiality of the adolescents seeking services, (iii) the referrals to improve appropriate package of services, and (iv) an overall environment to ensure an equity and non-discrimination for all the adolescents. Our findings unearth the barriers that both the service providers and the adolescents face at the AFHCs and underscore the need for regular monitoring and evaluation of the AFHCs to strengthen the facility-based intervention of the RKSK programme."

Several studies done have reported the presence of mixed populations of bacteria with a significant increase in Extended-Spectrum Beta-Lactamase (ESBL) Enterobacteriaceae spps, Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Multi-Drug Resistant (MDR) bacteria in urine and blood cultures of catheterized patients despite the use of prophylactic antibiotics. This study aimed at determining the bacterial species diversity and susceptibility patterns of indwelling urinary catheters from postpartum mothers attending Mbale Regional Referral Hospital (MRRH).A cross-sectional study employing quantitative and qualitative was carried out in MRRH among postpartum mothers with urinary catheters and their care-takers. The purposive non-random sampling strategy was used to collect data using an interviewer-administered questionnaire for the quantitative data collection and in-depth interviews for qualitative data collection. All the data collection tools used were developed, pretested and validated. At the point of de-catheterization, Catheter tips from enrolled participants were cut about 2-3cm below the balloon aseptically into test-tube containing peptone water, sonication technique employed, and incubation done 24hours then cultured to ensure phenotypic identification. An antibiotic sensitivity test was performed using the disc diffusion method following Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines. Quantitative data collected was entered in Microsoft Excel and then exported to STATA14 for statistical analysis. Thematic analysis was used to analyse and organise qualitative data by an inductive coding method using Nvivo 12 software.In this study, 208 postpartum mothers participated, the majority of whom were caesarean section mothers of age range 20-24 years and 17 care-takers with a median age of 32 years. The prevalence of catheter tips bacterial colonisation was 98% despite 88.5% of the participants being on broad-spectrum antibiotics. The average duration of catheterisation was 2 days. All bacteria isolates were potential uro-pathogens with a mean occurrence of 2 bacteria species in each urinary catheter tip. The rates of MDR to commonly used antibiotics were high. The urinary catheter size of greater than F14 and duration of catheterization greater than 2 days were significantly associated with the number of bacterial species isolated from each sample. The maintenance care and knowledge of care-urinary catheter care among the care-takers was found sub-optimal.There was a high prevalence of catheter colonisation with bacterial spps diversity averaging 2 spps per sample despite use of broad spectrum antibiotics. The MDR rates were high, which calls for routine culture and sensitivity. Health workers practicing obstetric medicine need to pay attention to catheter sizes during catheterisation and its duration. Health education should be part of antenatal and postnatal care education."
https://openalex.org/W4220687232,"Background Febrile illness is frequent among patients in the tropics. It is caused by a wide variety of common diseases such as malaria or gastrointestinal infections but also by less common but highly contagious pathogens with epidemic potential. This study describes the clinical features of adult and paediatric patients with febrile illness in in the largest tertiary referral hospital in south-eastern Guinea, a region at high risk for viral haemorrhagic fever outbreaks. The study further compares their diagnostic characteristics, treatments and outcomes with non-febrile patients in order to contribute to the local epidemiology of febrile illness. Methods We used retrospective data collection to record demographic and clinical data of all incoming patients during a study period of three months. For the follow-up study of inpatients, we retrospectively reviewed patient charts for diagnostic characteristics, diagnoses and outcomes. Results Of the 4317 incoming patients during the study period, 9.5% had a febrile illness. The most used diagnostic measures to identify causative agents in febrile patients were point-of-care tests and most treatments relied on antibiotics. Most common discharge diagnoses for febrile inpatients were malaria (9.6% adults, 56.7% children), salmonella gastroenteritis/typhoid (10.6% adults, 7.8% children) and respiratory infection/pneumonia (5.3% adults, 18.7% children). Inpatient mortality for children was significantly higher in febrile than non-febrile children (18.5% vs. 5.1%, p&lt;0.001) and considerably higher in febrile than non-febrile adults (29.8% vs. 25.0%, p = 0.404). Conclusions Malaria, respiratory infection and gastroenteritis are considered the main causes for febrile illness. The wide reliance on rapid diagnostic tests to diagnose febrile patients not only risks to over- or under-diagnose certain diseases but also leaves the possibility of highly infectious diseases in febrile patients unexplored. Furthermore, the heavy reliance on antibiotics risks to cause antimicrobial resistance. High mortality rates in febrile patients, especially children, should be of concern to public health authorities."
https://openalex.org/W4206048524,"Background People living with HIV (PLHIV) have a high risk of death if hospitalised in low-income countries. Tuberculosis has long been the leading cause of admission and death, in part due to suboptimal diagnostics. Two promising new diagnostic tools are digital chest Xray with computer-aided diagnosis (DCXR-CAD) and urine testing with Fujifilm SILVAMP LAM (FujiLAM). Neither test has been rigorously evaluated among inpatients. Test characteristics may be complementary, with FujiLAM especially sensitive for disseminated tuberculosis and DCXR-CAD especially sensitive for pulmonary tuberculosis, making combined interventions of interest. Design and methods An exploratory unblinded, single site, two-arm cluster randomised controlled trial, with day of admission as the unit of randomisation. A third, smaller, integrated cohort arm (4:4:1 random allocation) contributes to understanding case-mix, but not trial outcomes. Participants are adults living with HIV not currently on TB treatment. The intervention (DCXR-CAD plus urine FujiLAM plus usual care) is compared to usual care alone. The primary outcome is proportion of participants started on tuberculosis treatment by day 56, with secondary outcomes of mortality (time to event) measured to to 56 days from enrolment, proportions with undiagnosed tuberculosis at death or hospital discharge and comparing proportions with enrolment-day tuberculosis treatment initiation. Discussion Both DCXR-CAD and FujiLAM have potential clinical utility and may have complementary diagnostic performance. To our knowledge, this is the first randomised trial to evaluate these tests among hospitalised PLHIV."

According to the simulation results, the temperature profile with various HRRs and bifurcation angles was described. Furthermore, the effects of bifurcation angles and HRRs on the maximum temperature under the bifurcation tunnel ceiling and the temperature decay along the longitudinal direction of the branch were investigated. According to the theoretical analysis, two prediction models were proposed. These models can predict a bifurcation tunnel fire’s maximum temperature and longitudinal temperature decay in the branch. The results of this study could be valuable for modelling a bifurcation tunnel fire and benefit the fire engineering design of bifurcation tunnels."
https://openalex.org/W4206509706,"Objectives The aim was to evaluate the longitudinal course of motor skills development in children with a view to improve the understanding of intra-individual variance. Previous publications have been based on cross-sectional data or analyzed longitudinal studies in a cross-sectional manner. Design Longitudinal. Year-to-year change. Methods The present study is based on motor function data collected in the LIFE Child study (Germany). The participants (6 to 17 years) completed parts of the motor tests according to the standard of the German Motor Performance Test 6–18 (DMT). For a total of 1653 participants, 4616 motor tests with an annual interval in the period 2011 to 2019 were included in the evaluation. Results We were able to produce gender and age-specific change centiles for the test items standing long jump , jumping sideways , push-ups , stand and reach and balancing walking backwards . Each set of centiles revealed a range of variability in motor development in children and adolescents, with distinct progressive patterns in the different test items and different genders. The supplied tables offer an indication of expected year-to-year change for each test item depending on age and gender. Depending on the test item and the mean age, a deterioration in test results after a one-year interval was observed, despite cross-sectional centiles showing an upward trend. Conclusion We present a user-friendly tool as a way to assess individual dynamic changes in motor development of children and adolescents. In combination with the well-known cross-sectional centiles as baseline, this can be helpful for the scientific evaluation of motor skills tests and can also be used in school settings."
